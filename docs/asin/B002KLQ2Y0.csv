1275064,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B002KLQ2Y0,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","Let me start by saying that this movie is beautiful. The costumes, the locations, all are done marvelously and Franklyn is a feast for the eyes. The visual style and costumes also fit each character very well. If you are getting this movie, get it on blu ray. I think the visuals are this movie's strongest points.I can not say to much about what this film is about without giving away spoilers. It is about four people, a father looking for a lost son, a young man left by his bride before the wedding, a young woman devastated by the loss of her father, leading her to play with suicide for an art project and a masked vigilante living in a steam punk like alternate reality. The movie being s very confusing but do come together in the end. I think the plot of this movie was ok, it deals with topics like insanity, imagination and religion and the story is not bad, I however also think the story got boring at times, the movie moved to slowly.Now here is my main problem with this film, there are to many characters, in effect this is four films in one, if they had just cut one or two of the characters then everything would have been so much better. On that note I think the character Emilia is completely unnecessary. The other three character's storyline come together in the end, Emilia is just there, it is like the director decided he had to have a female character in the last possible moment and just threw one in without any sort of planning.Franklyn is a beautiful film, the story is rather ok and the characters are interesting. I say this film is rather ok. It was not completely my cup of tea, but if movies more on the artsy side suits you I think you will like this. I do not like artsy movies and I still found this entertaining. The movie is has some phasing problems, but in the end I think it is rather good.",3,Artsy film with a decent story.,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,1833,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'locations', 'are', 'done', 'marvelously', 'Franklyn', 'feast', 'eyes', 'visual', 'style', 'costumes', 'also', 'fit', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'getting', 'movie', 'get', 'blu', 'ray', 'think', 'visuals', 'are', 'movie', 'strongest', 'points.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'what', 'film', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'four', 'people', 'father', 'looking', 'lost', 'son', 'young', 'man', 'left', 'bride', 'wedding', 'young', 'woman', 'devastated', 'loss', 'father', 'leading', 'play', 'suicide', 'art', 'project', 'masked', 'vigilante', 'living', 'steam', 'punk', 'alternate', 'reality', 'movie', 'being', 's', 'very', 'confusing', 'do', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'think', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'ok', 'topics', 'insanity', 'imagination', 'religion', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'however', 'also', 'think', 'story', 'got', 'boring', 'times', 'movie', 'moved', 'slowly.Now', 'here', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'characters', 'effect', 'four', 'films', 'one', 'had', 'just', 'cut', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'then', 'everything', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'note', 'think', 'character', 'Emilia', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'other', 'three', 'character', 'storyline', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'Emilia', 'just', 'there', 'director', 'decided', 'had', 'have', 'female', 'character', 'last', 'possible', 'moment', 'just', 'threw', 'one', 'sort', 'planning.Franklyn', 'beautiful', 'film', 'story', 'rather', 'ok', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'say', 'film', 'rather', 'ok', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'cup', 'tea', 'movies', 'more', 'artsy', 'side', 'suits', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'do', 'not', 'artsy', 'movies', 'still', 'found', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'phasing', 'problems', 'end', 'think', 'rather', 'good']",N/A
1275065,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B002KLQ2Y0,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[24, 25]","Once in a blue moon, a film comes along that defies genre identification ...and so goes FRANKLYN, a movie that transcends anything you think you've ever seen. A hybrid in terms of style, Franklyn might best be described as Frank Miller (the artist) meetsThe Dark Knight(Batman) inBrazil(the movie). I say this because none of these items alone help explain the convoluted-ness that is this story, and none should. It goes beyond them. Way beyond them.Visually appealing on almost every level, Franklyn has two divergent stories that seem to have nothing to do with each other. In one we're privy to a kind of superhero trying to avenge the death of a young girl whom we know nothing about. He chases after ""The Individual"" in a city known as Meanwhile. Looking, as stated earlier, somewhere along the lines of a Frank Miller graphic mixed with a kind of Dark Knight quality, the story intrigues and makes us cheer on the main character, Jonathan Preest (Ryan Philleppe,Flags of Our Fathers). I mean, trying to avenge the death of an innocent girl is noble, right? Equally intriguing within the city of Meanwhile are the many religions that flourish, including the Seventh Day Manicurists. Everyone is required to have a religious affiliation ...except our ""hero"" who is subsequently tracked by highly skilled fighting monks.In the second story, a woman named Emilia (Eva Green,The Golden Compass) tries to come to terms with her life and her art. She consistently tries to kill herself for the sake of it only to learn that her art just isn't inspiring enough. Also, a man in search of his missing son comes to the psychiatrist who'd been treating him only to learn that his son escaped and is out in the world with a rifle slung over his shoulder.As the two storylines begin to mesh, reality skews, men and women we thought we knew either don't exist, exist as something else, or are strictly symbols (including a janitor who plays a vital role). The fascination the viewer will feel at the realizations of what is coming will shock, delight and sink their heart. Yes, it's THAT good.The visuals are what will initially draw you in. You'll be asking yourself ""Why?"" many times: Why is the city so muted? Why is he wearing a mask? Why are these religious fanatics chasing him? If you pay close attention, everything is answered in one final scene which, in itself, reveals amazing storytelling.I can't stress enough how closely everything is linked in the film and how paying attention reaps great benefits in the end. Even the names of the characters (Preest, The Individual, Wormsnakes, Pastor Bone) all have relevance.Made on a paltry $12 million budget, the movie feels much more expensive and expansive. Sadly, it did not get a wide release and suffered because of it. Not many people have ever heard of it. I know I never had until a friend I work with mentioned it. But I'm glad he pointed me in the right direction. This one's a hidden gem. And it's so original that you'll wonder which genre you're watching.

It stars  Ryan Phillippe as the titular character (usually behind an unrevealingly simplistic, but foreboding Mask) - but the real human Star of this film, who gives a remarkably intricate and multi-layered performance is Eva Green (from James Bond 'Casino Royale' and the new Showtime series 'Penny Dreadful').  Eva generates (actually in dual roles) = profoundly haunting, mysteriously deeply penetrating performance(s)!The Story reflects an incredibly complex jigsaw-puzzle (really of Four seemingly independent tales & characters) ==> that eventually converge into a singular critical mass/ instantaneous moment (with each seemingly disparate, Lonely and 'Lost' individual character playing a pivotal and irreplaceable role in the final revelation!)Telling anything further will result in giving away too much!  Although I also wanted to mention that the 'Visuals' of the anciently futuristic Theocracy called 'Meanwhile' City (in which the lonely masked vigilante-like character Franklyn lives) is quite amazing to behold (a cross-between Gotham City and the Vatican?!)One final word = it's a real shame about truly visionary, and risk-taking films like this one from Gerald McMorrow (and especially Vadim Perelman's inordinately Great, insightful, and even vitally important ""The Life Before her Eyes"" along with ""The East"" from Zal Batmanglij & Brit Marling; and von Trier's painfully haunting ""Melancholia"" also the ""Luzhin Defence"" by director Marleen Gorris, with John Turturro as Nabokov's brilliant but unstable Chess-Master!)  Why can't these films find a Sizable audience (they are sadly quite unknown, although very deserving of much Wider viewership) - while the hopelessly 'formulaic' stuff tends to make hundreds of millions of dollars*!!note*: of course there are exceptionally well-crafted (and even artistic) Blockbusters, like ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" and ""Watchmen"" and once in a great while, a special film does make an unexpected connection with wider audiences, like ""Pan's Labyrinth**""!note**: ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was made by Guillermo del Toro in Mexico & Spain (not Hollywood) and produced on a modest budget ==> but I think it's better and more insightful than nearly all similar 'Fantasy/horror' films costing 10x as much!!

I decided to see this movie on dvd based on its cover art and the actors who were in it, which is a terrible way of choosing a movie to see.

The story of the film follows four different characters and their intertwining paths, Milo the emotionally shattered lover, Emilia who is turning her self destruction into an art form, and the middle aged Peter who is looking for his estranged son. All of these previous characters stories take place in a modern day London, the fourth one, Jonathan Preest, takes place in the surreal Meanwhile City. Preest is a vigilante/criminal in a city of absurd faiths and is haunted by his failure to protect a young a girl.Its an all around solid movie, with great acting performances, interesting characters, a good story that does a good job of contrasting the Dark Fantasy elements with a cold hard reality, good costumes, sets, etc. Another thing I liked about this movie was that it borrows some themes from  Terry Gilliam's work in the 80s with the power of imagination, fantasy, and escapism but it still cutting its own way with the main focus on the sadness and personal misery that ultimately leads these characters to cross paths with each other in one form or another.

It is a visually breathtaking film with great acting, a solid script with lots of thought provoking material.I would caution against reading reviews that give the plot away since it will ruin the experience of watching this film.  It starts with a dark view of a city called Meanwhile where all citizens MUST have religion and any without are persecuted.  A masked hero explains his need to avenge the death of a small child who was cruelly sacrificed to their God.  Then we flash to current times to meet a man who has just been jilted the day before his wedding and a troubled young woman who meticulously plans her suicide attempts for the benefit of her mother and ""Art.""  We watch these three main characters as their fates collide for one brief moment in Franklyn's flat.The beauty of this film - forgetting the cinematography for a moment - is the seamless blending of the two worlds by the end.  We discover who Sarah really is and how she was viewed to be sacrificed since it was explained as ""God's will.""  We see the young man's childhood playmate come back to him in his moment of need as lovingly explained by his mother.  We discover why the woman was so troubled.This movie is full of thought provoking moments.  As the troubled young woman toys with suicide and gets advice from someone who knows - it's not just about the lives you leave behind but the people who lives you've yet to touch. This movie does not attack religion but addresses one man's need to question after serving in Iraq and then suffering further loses once home.  Why do bad things happen to good people?  If God is able to change this, why would he choose not to?  Why honor a Malevolent God? If God not capable of changing these moments? Then why call him God?This movie shines despite it's darkness.

1275087,A3J20HDHEMAS4U,B002KLQ2Y0,Michael,"[0, 0]","""Franklyn"" encompasses an interesting cross-section of genres. The film is composed of two worlds: Meanwhile City, brimming in sci-fi elements and painted in dark gothic tones with iron fisted religious fanaticism. This is paralleled by modern-day London, while seemingly mundane - having mysteries of it's own. Strong psychological elements bind Meanwhile City to modern day London, and the ending ties up ""just enough"" elements to satisfy, while leaving a few riddles open for discussion.One of the issues with the film, for some viewers, is the main character Franklyn. He appears mostly in trench coat with a uniquely stiched - almost featureless hood, save for large blackened eye sockets. It would seem that this stylistic choice holds too much baggage - E.G. invoking expectations approaching the Watchman's masked vigilante ""Rorschach"". While not a superhero, Franklyn is the tragically intriguing fulcrum of the film; Ryan Phillippe carries the part well. Interestingly enough, the promotional posters featured an unmasked version of Franklyn.The movie instantly engrosses viewers within the otherworldly Meanwhile city, and takes it's time wrapping modern-day London around you - all the while leading you to the subtle intersection of the worlds and characters. This is an intellectual journey through a science-fiction/ psychological-thriller. It's deeper than ""The Book of Eli"", but not quite as challenging as ""Solaris"".Intellectual sci-fi isn't for everyone.

So, you are forewarned.you've had your chance to click away ...... review and spoilers next ....I've seen a bunch of reviews that compare ""Franklyn"" to ""Dark City"" or ""Blade Runner"" or ""City of Lost Children"".  And yes, there is some of that.  Its myriad-thread plot reminds me of the movie ""Exotica,"" and if you like ""Franklyn,"" consider watching ""Exotica""( warning: Exotica contains copious amounts of nudity).  But ""Franklyn"" is fresh and original.  Therein lie some of its problems.This movie may offend some people who are easily offended about religion.  While the movie does poke fun at a myriad of nonsensical religions (the ""bearded suits"" outtake in the deleted scenes is a glimpse of the delicious direction this movie could have/should have gone if it had spent more time in Meanwhile City), the parody is in brilliant context.  David is a young man driven mad by the death of his sister.  David's churchman father has explained the girl's tragic death as ""God's will.""  Therefore, David retreats from the real world/London to his imaginary Meanwhile City, where he reimagines himself as the masked avenger John Preest and rebels against God and fate.This is revealed fairly early on.  And again, movies that happen in a character's head aren't unique, either.  But the problem with ""Franklyn"" is it keeps leaving Meanwhile City to dawdle through mundane London, where we watch competing plots unfold in the lives of Milo, a romantic young man who was jilted at the altar, and Emilia, a woman who is making suicide attempts as an art form. If you're like me, you'll end up wishing that Emilia succeeds sooner rather than later.  And Milo -- that boy needs to get laid.The lives of these mundane inhabitants of real-life London so pales next to Preest's adventures in Meanwhile City that you might want to fast-forward to the Steampunk.  However, there are important threads and clues you'll miss if you do.The movie raises some fascinating questions about the nature of reality.  It's better than half the crap made by big Hollywood studios.  And unlike many independent films, ""Franklyn"" is all wrapped up in the end (a bit too neatly).  So, it deserves 4 stars.Why not 5 stars?  In the end, while I found the movie fresh and original, it was too clever by half.  And when I start nit-picking before the movie is over, it's a sign the director has failed to capture me with his story.Did the following things bother you ...* If you've been shot by a sniper rifle, what are the odds you're going to start flirting with the next girl you meet while you are bleeding on the sidewalk?  Yeah, yeah, I know who she looks like, but still ... shot. Ouch!* And why is she attracted to a man bleeding on a sidewalk? Yes, I know ... fate/otherworldly connection.  Still.* How did David smuggle his service rifle into London anyway?  Hasn't he been in a mental hospital for 4 years?  And he supposedly served in Basra, but that rifle looks to be from an earlier conflict.  That's just sloppy writing.I don't think you'll be sorry for watching this movie.

Meanwhile, the visuals and sounds are conveyed eloquently and with outstanding Blu clarity. The picture is tested in every single Meanwhile City panoramic, and each time I would pause it to look for flaws and holes - but couldn't really find any. There are very few scenes with bright colors, but when they show up the saturation/contrast is just right. The DTS was ideal. Reference the scene with Ryan's character surrounding the snake guy, or any of the off-camera sounds being moved around the channels perfectly (answering machine shots, hospital sounds, etc.) Phillippe's voice does not the have the ideal inflections for a film-length narration, but you get through it because it is usually over the fantasy world sequences where you might spend more time looking at all they are putting before you.The supplements include:* A brief ad-plug style making of that should definitely be watched after the movie (gives away all of the twists).* Interviews. They all last 32 minutes total, and can be watched individually or as a play all. Main cast and crew are dryly interviewed on set, but they give some vital info on the inspiration, logistics and (appropriately) some of the confusion people have in trying to describe everything that is Franklyn.* Deleted scenes. Less than 10 minutes but I enjoyed seeing more of the red haired lady and her wonderful role.A very obscure and darkly anti-religious/faith film, but worth the watch if you would like a mix ofDark City (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] meets a masked man noir narrative.

It deals with serious, mature topics in the present and real world. So those expecting an escapist ""Dark City"" et al. genre will be sorely disappointed.The viewer is tossed right in the middle of four unrelated characters's lives each on the crest of life changing personal turmoil. Paced episodically, we have no history as to how the character reached that particular state in their life, but as the movie unfolds a workable sketch emerges just enough to satisfy our curiosity about that person's circumstance.The fun in watching this movie- and the principal motivating factor to continue viewing- lies in figuring out how will all these unrelated plot lines ultimately be tied in and reconciled. In this regard Franklyn succeeds in delivering an unexpected twist, but does so awkwardly.The main problem with this movie is that most of the characters are rather unsympathetic, superficial and self indulgent. It is difficult to form a bond with them or care much about their problems. The ""fantasy future world"" of religious dystopia offers the most satisfying experience, rich with atmosphere and some biting sarcasm. However, this ""world"" remains marginal to the overall theme.Because of this tepid interest in the characters, even as the build up to some inevitable conclusion, it's more about detached curiosity of how the writers will reconcile the plot rather than sincere involvement with the movie itself.

1275096,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B002KLQ2Y0,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Revolving around four lost souls and set in two parallel worlds, Franklyn certainly isn't the Dark City/superhero movie it was rather misleadingly sold as but a rather more ambitious variation on that old arthouse favourite, the apparent strangers who are gradually drawn to the same place and event that will impact differently on each of their lives. There's probably no more to it than meets the eye, but Gerald McMorrow moves and shoots his pieces so well that it's surprisingly satisfying to see them come together. If anything, despite its impressively designed if sparingly used fantasy scenes, the film is probably more influenced by Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire with its hints of people, possibly real, possibly not, who come into your life at the right time and then fade away.Eva Green is a troubled performance artist whose art project is built around filming her meticulously planned suicide attempts; Bernard Hill a church warden searching London for his missing son; Sam Riley an incurable romantic just jilted at the altar yet again and searching for his childhood sweetheart; and Ryan Philippe a masked atheist in a city of religious fanatics seeking revenge on the cult leader who killed a girl he was hired to protect. Gradually stories and actors (though not their roles) start to overlap, fantasies punctured and old wounds reopened or cauterised. Think about it too much and you'll probably be way ahead of the filmmakers, but go with the film at its own pace and it's surprisingly rewarding. McMurrow has a real visual sense that too few British filmmakers have: it's not just empty style or good looking shots for the sake of being good looking but in service of the story, characters and ideas. Those ideas may not be particularly deep or profound - ultimately little more than the need to acknowledge reality, however painful, rather than hiding in fantasy before you can move on - but they're delivered with sincerity and imagination and, with the partial exception of Riley's rather typically milquetoast turn, convincingly played.It'd be stretching it to say that Franklyn is a great film, but it is a great and encouraging directorial debut. It'll be interesting to see what McMorrow comes up with next.The Blu Ray has a decent selection of extras for a film that made so little impression at the box-office, including making of featurette and deleted scenes but not, sadly, McMorrow's 2002 short Thespian X which inspired the film.",4,"""If you believe in something strongly enough, who's to say if it's real or not?""",1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,2462,"['Revolving', 'around', 'four', 'lost', 'souls', 'set', 'two', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'Franklyn', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Dark', 'City/superhero', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'misleadingly', 'sold', 'rather', 'more', 'ambitious', 'variation', 'old', 'arthouse', 'favourite', 'apparent', 'strangers', 'who', 'are', 'gradually', 'drawn', 'same', 'place', 'event', 'will', 'impact', 'differently', 'lives', 'probably', 'more', 'eye', 'Gerald', 'McMorrow', 'moves', 'shoots', 'pieces', 'so', 'well', 'surprisingly', 'satisfying', 'see', 'come', 'together', 'anything', 'impressively', 'designed', 'sparingly', 'used', 'fantasy', 'scenes', 'film', 'probably', 'more', 'influenced', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'Wings', 'Desire', 'hints', 'people', 'possibly', 'real', 'possibly', 'not', 'who', 'come', 'life', 'right', 'time', 'then', 'fade', 'away.Eva', 'Green', 'troubled', 'performance', 'artist', 'art', 'project', 'built', 'filming', 'meticulously', 'planned', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'church', 'warden', 'searching', 'London', 'missing', 'son', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'incurable', 'romantic', 'just', 'jilted', 'altar', 'yet', 'again', 'searching', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'masked', 'atheist', 'city', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'cult', 'leader', 'who', 'killed', 'girl', 'was', 'hired', 'protect', 'Gradually', 'stories', 'actors', 'not', 'roles', 'start', 'overlap', 'fantasies', 'punctured', 'old', 'wounds', 'reopened', 'cauterised', 'Think', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'way', 'ahead', 'filmmakers', 'go', 'film', 'own', 'pace', 'surprisingly', 'rewarding', 'McMurrow', 'real', 'visual', 'sense', 'too', 'few', 'British', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'not', 'just', 'empty', 'style', 'good', 'looking', 'shots', 'sake', 'being', 'good', 'looking', 'service', 'story', 'characters', 'ideas', 'ideas', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'particularly', 'deep', 'profound', 'ultimately', 'more', 'need', 'acknowledge', 'reality', 'however', 'painful', 'rather', 'hiding', 'fantasy', 'can', 'move', ""'re"", 'delivered', 'sincerity', 'imagination', 'partial', 'exception', 'Riley', 'rather', 'typically', 'milquetoast', 'turn', 'convincingly', 'played.It', ""'d"", 'be', 'stretching', 'say', 'Franklyn', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'encouraging', 'directorial', 'debut', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'McMorrow', 'up', 'next.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'decent', 'selection', 'extras', 'film', 'made', 'so', 'little', 'impression', 'box-office', 'including', 'making', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'not', 'sadly', 'McMorrow', '2002', 'short', 'Thespian', 'X', 'inspired', 'film']",N/A
