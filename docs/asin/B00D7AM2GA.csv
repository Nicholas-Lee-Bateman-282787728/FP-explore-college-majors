Fillbrandt,"[0, 0]","I haven't watched all of them yet and it will take some time to watch 66 hours of detective mysteries, but Jack Frost is a great detective.  I have never seen a detective who has had so many partners!  Every episode he has a new partner as though he is a trainer or teacher and I think he feels that way too.  He is a very loving and caring man, but can be very high strung when need be.  I think the thing I like the most about Frost is his humor and the fact that he won't let his boss intimidate him what so ever!  I haven't regretted it once for buying the complete series and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest.",5,I wish there were more!,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,620,"['have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'watch', '66', 'hours', 'detective', 'mysteries', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'great', 'detective', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'detective', 'who', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'partners', 'episode', 'new', 'partner', 'trainer', 'teacher', 'think', 'way', 'too', 'very', 'loving', 'caring', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'high', 'strung', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'think', 'thing', 'like', 'most', 'Frost', 'humor', 'fact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'boss', 'intimidate', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'have', ""n't"", 'regretted', 'once', 'buying', 'complete', 'series', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'rest']",A Touch of Frost: Complete Series
1654091,A1UCAVBNJUZMPR,B00D7AM2GA,Dabuck,"[12, 12]","We only saw small previews of this series from Acorn media at the beginning of other DVDs. We are so impressed with the quality of British Mystery television series (Midsomer Murders, Last Detective, Morse, Lewis, Blue Murder, New tricks, etc.)  that we decided to risk it and buy this complete series DVD set of Frost. We have only viewed the first 2 episodes, and they may not be as good as the afor-mentioned series, but we do NOT regret the purchase. Even the mediocre British mystery detective series are so much better than the crap that passes for US quality programming (With exceptions of course). We are enjoying this series and look forward to seeing the many episodes left for us to view. We recommend it if you enjoy British television.12/09/13 We finished the series last night. It is an excellent series. It has one of the few ""extra"" bonus items that was actually enjoyable to watch. I never realized the series ran for 17 years. One caution about the set we have, the DVD's were a b*tch to remove from its mount. I was afraid of snapping one while trying to remove it, but that's the packaging - nothing to do with the content.",5,VERY GOOD SERIES - WE LIKE IT.  12/09/13 UPDATE,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1144,"['only', 'saw', 'small', 'previews', 'series', 'Acorn', 'media', 'beginning', 'other', 'DVDs', 'are', 'so', 'impressed', 'quality', 'British', 'Mystery', 'television', 'series', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Last', 'Detective', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'Blue', 'Murder', 'New', 'tricks', 'etc', 'decided', 'risk', 'buy', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'set', 'Frost', 'have', 'only', 'viewed', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'afor-mentioned', 'series', 'do', 'NOT', 'regret', 'purchase', 'Even', 'mediocre', 'British', 'mystery', 'detective', 'series', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'crap', 'US', 'quality', 'programming', 'exceptions', 'course', 'are', 'enjoying', 'series', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'many', 'episodes', 'left', 'view', 'recommend', 'enjoy', 'British', 'television.12/09/13', 'finished', 'series', 'last', 'night', 'excellent', 'series', 'one', 'few', 'extra', 'bonus', 'items', 'was', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'never', 'realized', 'series', 'ran', '17', 'years', 'One', 'caution', 'set', 'have', 'DVD', 'were', 'b*tch', 'remove', 'mount', 'was', 'afraid', 'snapping', 'one', 'trying', 'remove', 'packaging', 'nothing', 'do', 'content']",A Touch of Frost: Complete Series

It is wonderful to find them all in one place at such a reasonable price.

Some programs are ok except for the intro music, some the actual sound of the actors is just too low............ my husband said &#34;sound by Lucas&#34; but it is not amusing to have to wrench around on my mixer for each individual program and then return it to my normal settings.Over and above that problem, seeing Frost in one grouping is wonderful. We both really like David Jason's irreverent Frost and his inside jokes and his general calm demeanor.

My Mom first encountered &#34;Only Fools and Horses&#34; and was delighted to receive this set and find that Sir Jason has &#34;still got it!&#34; As a crime drama about a dedicated detective and the down and dirty of his everyday routine, this is a far cry from &#34;Horses&#34; humor.
