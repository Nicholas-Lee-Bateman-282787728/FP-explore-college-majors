817048,AR15V2ULA2EYM,B0001Y4MPE,Antonio Giusto,"[8, 15]",I couldn't even finish watching this film. I wanted to slit my wrists. This film gave me a sick feeling inside.I don't understand why most Indie flicks have to be terribly composed. Just cause the film was made for cheap doesn't mean it has to look cheap. Here's a tip to all indie flick directors: Hand held camerawork does not create a sense of reality. For me it just takes away from the realism. A shakey camera only reminds people that there's a camera there and that they're watching a movie. The hand held thing only works successfully if performed by people who have mastered hand held camerawork. Stop trying to pass off inexperience as art. People don't fall for it anymore.I was looking so forward to seeing this film. This is just sloppy film making. I'm sorry but I guess I can't just look past all that. It has to be a really incredible story for me to sit through something like this. Unfortunetly the story here is incredibly depressing and not portrayed well by it's players. I don't think any of the actors in this film really know how to properly portray these types of characters. Characters in a story like this should never be portrayed by actors. They're too real to be portrayed by actors. I'm sorry but all I saw was famous supporting actors acting. It was sad affair and an insult to people who have real problems simular to the characters in this film.This film would have been better off not being made at all.,2,Holy depressing!,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,1438,"['could', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'watching', 'film', 'wanted', 'slit', 'wrists', 'film', 'gave', 'sick', 'feeling', 'inside.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'most', 'Indie', 'flicks', 'have', 'be', 'terribly', 'composed', 'Just', 'cause', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'cheap', ""n't"", 'mean', 'look', 'cheap', 'Here', 'tip', 'indie', 'flick', 'directors', 'Hand', 'held', 'camerawork', 'not', 'create', 'sense', 'reality', 'just', 'away', 'realism', 'shakey', 'camera', 'only', 'people', 'camera', 'there', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'hand', 'held', 'thing', 'only', 'successfully', 'performed', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'mastered', 'hand', 'held', 'camerawork', 'Stop', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'inexperience', 'art', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'anymore.I', 'was', 'looking', 'so', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'just', 'sloppy', 'film', 'making', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'look', 'be', 'really', 'incredible', 'story', 'sit', 'something', 'Unfortunetly', 'story', 'here', 'incredibly', 'depressing', 'not', 'portrayed', 'well', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actors', 'film', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'properly', 'portray', 'types', 'characters', 'Characters', 'story', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'portrayed', 'actors', ""'re"", 'too', 'real', 'be', 'portrayed', 'actors', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'saw', 'was', 'famous', 'supporting', 'actors', 'acting', 'was', 'sad', 'affair', 'insult', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'real', 'problems', 'simular', 'characters', 'film.This', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'not', 'being', 'made']",N/A

817050,A1ZOUKFV07V8RK,B0001Y4MPE,hated and proud,"[0, 0]","""13 Moons"" is an interesting albeit flawed film. Personally I enjoyed this one. Basically the plot is there are these characters some of which know some of the others in one way or another but none of them know everybody who end up trying to save this sick boy who is a son of one of them. It sounds weird, it is. Honestly the names attracted me to this movie, the cast is riddled with familiar names. Even though I really liked this film some of the flaws stand out. One of which is since there are so many different characters in this movie and all of their ""stories"" are told, in a 90 minute feature that leaves little detail or growth that can be adequately shown. Everyone had their direction and character and that's what was portrayed from each of them throughout the entire film, with little background (sometimes none) and little changes. Acting was okay, but with such names I kind of expected more. As a Peter Stormare fan I have to say he wasn't able to play the part well, instead of seeing a drug addicted weirdo lunatic I saw Peter Stormare trying to play a drug addicted weirdo lunatic. And that goes for a lot of the more well known actors in this film. Karyn Parsons, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and Gareth Williams deliver the best acting overall whereas Buscemi, Dinklage, Proval, and Stormare deliver below-expectations performances. But even with these flaws I found myself absolutely loving this film until the very end. Up until that Parsons' and Pruitt's characters along with an amazing soundtrack, decent atomosphere, and indie look kept me very interested, as I said, until the end. I felt like the entire movie was culminating to an obvious but still satisfying end where instead they decided to go a different route which although not terrible wasn't as good as I was hoping for. All in all I really did enjoy this film. At times, it was funny. At times, it was poignant. Isn't that what a comedy-drama is supposed to be?",4,"Very good, but flawed",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,1944,"['13', 'Moons', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'flawed', 'film', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'Basically', 'plot', 'are', 'characters', 'know', 'others', 'one', 'way', 'none', 'know', 'everybody', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'trying', 'save', 'sick', 'boy', 'who', 'son', 'one', 'weird', 'Honestly', 'names', 'attracted', 'movie', 'cast', 'riddled', 'familiar', 'names', 'Even', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'flaws', 'stand', 'out', 'One', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'movie', 'stories', 'are', 'told', '90', 'minute', 'feature', 'little', 'detail', 'growth', 'can', 'be', 'adequately', 'shown', 'Everyone', 'had', 'direction', 'character', 'what', 'was', 'portrayed', 'entire', 'film', 'little', 'background', 'sometimes', 'none', 'little', 'changes', 'Acting', 'was', 'okay', 'such', 'names', 'kind', 'expected', 'more', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'fan', 'have', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'play', 'part', 'well', 'instead', 'seeing', 'drug', 'addicted', 'lunatic', 'saw', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'trying', 'play', 'drug', 'addicted', 'weirdo', 'lunatic', 'lot', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'film', 'Karyn', 'Parsons', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'Gareth', 'Williams', 'deliver', 'best', 'acting', 'overall', 'whereas', 'Buscemi', 'Dinklage', 'Proval', 'Stormare', 'deliver', 'below-expectations', 'performances', 'even', 'flaws', 'found', 'absolutely', 'loving', 'film', 'very', 'end', 'Parsons', 'Pruitt', 'characters', 'amazing', 'soundtrack', 'decent', 'atomosphere', 'indie', 'look', 'kept', 'very', 'interested', 'said', 'end', 'felt', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'culminating', 'obvious', 'still', 'satisfying', 'end', 'where', 'instead', 'decided', 'go', 'different', 'route', 'not', 'terrible', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'was', 'hoping', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'times', 'was', 'funny', 'times', 'was', 'poignant', ""n't"", 'what', 'comedy-drama', 'supposed', 'be']",N/A
817051,A1EKSETIBS9ETQ,B0001Y4MPE,,"[2, 11]","Rented this movie just by cover value and was very disappointed. This movie is one of those artistic low budget movies that you find once in a while if you avoid disappointments. While some thinking-movies give you a new perspective in seeing the world, &quot;13 Moon&quot; does nothing new.""13 Moon"" has bunches of minor characters' plots coming together to form a simple plot of saving a child. These many different characters cross each other paths throughout the movie without knowing any significations of the other characters' goals.A stripper helps a priest. The priest helps a singer. The singer is pregnant by a music producer. The music producer calls up a jail-bailer. The jail bailer knows a clown. The clown loves a stripper. These characters are more or less all linked together in what seem to be a small world. Each character has their own problem and agendas, but seems to gravitate together toward helping a dying boy. This movie is slow and boring, I like artist movies, but this one is really cheap. A movie similar and better then this one is &quot;Snatch.&quot; Which has four or so plots throughout the movie that combine together in a grand finale? 21 grams in a sense is very similar and has more believable character that &quot;13 Moons&quot;, with a bunch of no name pain actors, can't deliver.",2,Can't be this bad,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,1321,"['Rented', 'movie', 'just', 'cover', 'value', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'one', 'artistic', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'find', 'once', 'while', 'avoid', 'disappointments', 'thinking-movies', 'give', 'new', 'perspective', 'seeing', 'world', 'quot', '13', 'Moon', 'quot', 'nothing', 'new', '13', 'Moon', 'bunches', 'minor', 'characters', 'plots', 'coming', 'together', 'form', 'simple', 'plot', 'saving', 'child', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'cross', 'other', 'paths', 'movie', 'knowing', 'significations', 'other', 'characters', 'goals.A', 'stripper', 'priest', 'priest', 'singer', 'singer', 'pregnant', 'music', 'producer', 'music', 'producer', 'up', 'jail-bailer', 'jail', 'bailer', 'clown', 'clown', 'stripper', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'linked', 'together', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'small', 'world', 'character', 'own', 'problem', 'agendas', 'gravitate', 'together', 'helping', 'dying', 'boy', 'movie', 'slow', 'boring', 'like', 'artist', 'movies', 'one', 'really', 'cheap', 'movie', 'similar', 'better', 'then', 'one', 'quot', 'Snatch.', 'quot', 'Which', 'four', 'so', 'plots', 'movie', 'combine', 'together', 'grand', 'finale', '21', 'grams', 'sense', 'very', 'similar', 'more', 'believable', 'character', 'quot', '13', 'Moons', 'quot', 'bunch', 'name', 'pain', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deliver']",N/A
