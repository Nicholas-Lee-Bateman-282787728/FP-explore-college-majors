296425,AJHH9UI97MRZZ,6302113237,Alma Bouchot,"[9, 9]","What I can say about this lovely movie is that it was a very original idea to show the two points of view (male and female) about the developing of their relationship. Full of tiny delicious details, both stories are perfectly credible in real life, and at the same time show moments of comic fantasy as metaphors of the way people interpret facts in real life (the narrative resource that makes the Ally McBeal's tv serie rocks!). I think the audience could identify themselves in the main characters, and that the main concept of the movie was cristal clear at the end of the movie, that, no matter the whole bunch diferences between the two stories, and between them, they loved each other. Two ways to see it, but one and only true feeling: LOVE.AND THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT!!",5,What can I say?

I liked how the movie starts by showing the man's perspective on the relationship than switches and shows the girl's perspective on the same events. Cute how it ties everything together.

296428,A1ZH086GZYL5MZ,6302113237,Doug DeBolt,"[5, 7]","Bacon plays the perfect bachelor -- committed to his errant ways and happy to play the field. Elizabeth Perkins is the self-assured single woman, suspicious of field-playing men. Together they forge a new life, but with mixed results. When the relationship blows up, each tells their story from their own viewpoint. And, of course, the finer details differ greatly in each story, particularly when it comes to who was to blame for their problems.It's a winning idea, and it's creatively delivered. However, the chemistry between Bacon and Perkins never quite gels. Part of me almost wants to tell Bacon to run off with Sharon Stone halfway through the movie. The script was a bit uneven, leaving several low-points throughout the film during which I was able to fetch a snack or two without missing much. However, the payoff is romantic and sweet enough to make &quot;He Said, She Said&quot; a good-enough movie that I wouldn't mind seeing again.",3,Missing something...,1013040000,"02 7, 2002",2002,946,"['Bacon', 'perfect', 'bachelor', 'committed', 'errant', 'ways', 'happy', 'play', 'field', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'self-assured', 'single', 'woman', 'suspicious', 'field-playing', 'men', 'Together', 'forge', 'new', 'life', 'mixed', 'results', 'When', 'relationship', 'up', 'tells', 'story', 'own', 'viewpoint', 'course', 'finer', 'details', 'differ', 'greatly', 'story', 'particularly', 'when', 'who', 'was', 'blame', 'problems.It', 'winning', 'idea', 'creatively', 'delivered', 'However', 'chemistry', 'Bacon', 'Perkins', 'never', 'quite', 'gels', 'Part', 'almost', 'tell', 'Bacon', 'run', 'off', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'halfway', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'bit', 'uneven', 'leaving', 'several', 'low-points', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'fetch', 'snack', 'two', 'missing', 'much', 'However', 'payoff', 'romantic', 'sweet', 'enough', 'make', 'quot', 'Said', 'Said', 'quot', 'good-enough', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'again']",N/A

These differences are significant enough that the world is thereby gifted with multitudinous opportunities for comedy. This movie takes advantage of many of those opportunities. It is a riot.The story centers around a pair of young journalists. They are competing with each other for a newspaper column. In an act of spineless cravenness, the editors decide to run both columns and treat the pair as rivals. The formula works well for the newspaper and for the young writers. It also brings them closer together.To begin with, they did not much like each other. As they spend time together, however, they fall in love. This is a big step for both of them. For his part, he willingly gives up having sex with every hottie in town. For her part, she needs to trust him and not push him too hard. Each tires very hard and but each has a talent for pushing the other's buttons and hacking the other off.The film opens at the point where the newspaper has metamorphed into a TV spot. Right after he gives his opinion, she beans him with her coffer cup. The rest of the movie is a series of flashbacks as they each relieve their memories. Being a man and woman, they have very different memories of the same events. It is absolutely hilarious.Check it out.
