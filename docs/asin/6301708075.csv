Some of the facts depicted differ signficantly from the biography as presented in the Wikipedia, though the battles with his father appear accurate.  The DVD is not sourced from good material.  The colors are often faded and the sound has a narrow frequency range.  However, the music of Strauss comes through and the story is enjoyable.  Of particular interest was the spectacular sets and the dancing.  One can learn much about how to choreograph large groups of dancers from watching this movie.  Also the costumes were amazing even with the sub par production values of the DVD.  It is a pleasant movie.

I must have been too young when it first aired.This film was not only a complete surprise, it was an utter delight as well. The period costumes and settings are well done. The acting is good. Kerwin Mathews does a fine job as Strauss, Jr. and Brian Aherne is top-notch as the domineering father.Much of the film is given over to the wonderful Strauss melodies.  This will either delight or annoy, depending on the viewer's taste, but for me, I couldn't get enough of this enchanting music.  Bravo to Walt Disney for presenting a program geared more toward adults than kids, but one which kids could easily follow and learn about the life of this musical genius.  It serves the dual purpose of being both entertaining and educational.This was my first taste of the Disney Generations Collection.

I was so happy to discover they had decided to provide ON-DEMAND DVD titles of older Disney films not avilable in wide distribution just like the Warner Brothers Archive collection, and Universal, and Fox studios have done. I own on-demand titles from all those studios, and although they are standard definition sources, the prints they have used for transfer have been of the best quality, very sharp picture and superb sound, and with the original color saturation. I was so happy to find the forgotten ""THE WALTZ KING"" available  from the ""DISNEY GENERATIONS COLLECTION"", but terribly dissapointed to see they used a very faded and pinkish looking print as the source. A friend of mine used to own a somewhat worn but otherwise gorgeous IB TECHNICOLOR 16mm print of this movie with absolutely perfect colors. I must say I am embarrassed that Disney has released such a substandard product. Shame on you folks. Where is the Disney pride for perfection. This is a great movie and it deserves better.

The Vienna Symphony performed the score so it's truly from the Viennese heart. Most of the information is historically accurate and Disney has done an excellent job dramatizing the events.

262732,A6GMEO3VRY51S,6301708075,microjoe,"[22, 22]","BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: This made for television project was aimed at a more adult audience than the typical Disney project. Walt Disney personally gave the green light to the project, but after his death these type of projects were not part of the new managments idea of Disney anymore, and that is a shame. Walt had a much broader variety of film product than most people realizze today. The script he approved was by Disney studio writer Maurice Tombragel. Maurice came to the Disney Studios, already succesful at network television writing for popular westerns such as Bat Masterson, and stayed at the company for 9 years. His scripts for Disney included the theatrical release ""Moon Pilot"", as well as episodes of the weekly Disney show including ""Bristle Face"", and but he started with episodes of the well written ""Elfego Baca"".  He based the Waltz King script on a story by Fritz Eckhardt. As was the practice by Walt Disney at the time, the film crew, supporting cast, costumers, art directors, set builders and decorators were all local people from the community where the project was filmed with the exception of the writer a few of the actors and the director.  Walt strove for authenticity and culture in this program and it showed. The entire picture was filmed on location in Vienna, Austria and at the Wien Film Rosenhuget Studios in Vienna.  The music was arranged and conducted from the works of Strauss by Helmuth Froschauer, and performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The show was filmed to be a two-episode show on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color on NBC,  and premiered on October 7 & November 3 of 1963. The two episodes were edited together as a 94 minute movie and released theatrically overseas. It aired as a television repeat on the Walt Disney show on August 1 & 8, 1971. It was released in the movie edited version to the VHS rental market in 1986, and as of this date has not been released again. This would be highly worthy of a DVD release, and I heartily recommend.THE PLOT: Drama, romance, in this bio-pic. This movie was so good,  I only wish I had seen it sooner.  It is the biography of Johann Strauss, Jr., the famous Viennese composer. Strauss was raised in the shadow of his famous father, a successful composer of his own right. Senior Strauss forbids his son to seek music as a career, feeling the negative side of celebrity and a musician's life is harmful. As his son attempts to seek this career the father's fear turns into jealousy as he tries to use is extensive connections in the music worked to sabotage his son and he forces his son to leave home.  As junior becomes a starving musician and selling violin lessons for food while he writes, he meets a famous woman opera singer, who begins to help him in his career to undo the damage of his father.  Strauss will have to work even harder to be the famous Waltz King, and find love. I really enjoyed this film in my recent viewing. The city of Vienna and its concert halls combined with the period costumes are stunning in their beauty, and would almost steal the show if it had not been for the terrific script and acting. And the music, the wonderful music... Even if you are not a fan of classical music it will sweep you away.",5,"Authentic Vienna on location, not a studio backlot in the U.S.",1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,3247,"['THE', 'SCENES', 'TRIVIA', 'made', 'television', 'project', 'was', 'aimed', 'more', 'adult', 'audience', 'typical', 'Disney', 'project', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'personally', 'gave', 'green', 'light', 'project', 'death', 'type', 'projects', 'were', 'not', 'part', 'new', 'managments', 'idea', 'Disney', 'anymore', 'shame', 'Walt', 'had', 'much', 'broader', 'variety', 'film', 'product', 'most', 'people', 'realizze', 'today', 'script', 'approved', 'was', 'Disney', 'studio', 'writer', 'Maurice', 'Tombragel', 'Maurice', 'came', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'already', 'succesful', 'network', 'television', 'writing', 'popular', 'westerns', 'such', 'Bat', 'Masterson', 'stayed', 'company', '9', 'years', 'scripts', 'Disney', 'included', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Moon', 'Pilot', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'weekly', 'Disney', 'show', 'including', 'Bristle', 'Face', 'started', 'episodes', 'well', 'written', 'Elfego', 'Baca', 'based', 'Waltz', 'King', 'script', 'story', 'Fritz', 'Eckhardt', 'was', 'practice', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'time', 'film', 'crew', 'supporting', 'cast', 'costumers', 'art', 'directors', 'set', 'builders', 'decorators', 'were', 'local', 'people', 'community', 'where', 'project', 'was', 'filmed', 'exception', 'writer', 'few', 'actors', 'director', 'Walt', 'strove', 'authenticity', 'culture', 'program', 'showed', 'entire', 'picture', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Vienna', 'Austria', 'Wien', 'Film', 'Rosenhuget', 'Studios', 'Vienna', 'music', 'was', 'arranged', 'conducted', 'works', 'Strauss', 'Helmuth', 'Froschauer', 'performed', 'Vienna', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'be', 'two-episode', 'show', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Color', 'NBC', 'premiered', 'October', '7', 'November', '3', '1963', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'edited', 'together', '94', 'minute', 'movie', 'released', 'theatrically', 'overseas', 'aired', 'television', 'repeat', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'show', 'August', '1', '8', '1971', 'was', 'released', 'movie', 'edited', 'version', 'VHS', 'rental', 'market', '1986', 'date', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'highly', 'worthy', 'DVD', 'release', 'heartily', 'recommend.THE', 'PLOT', 'Drama', 'romance', 'bio-pic', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'sooner', 'biography', 'Johann', 'Strauss', 'Jr.', 'famous', 'Viennese', 'composer', 'Strauss', 'was', 'raised', 'shadow', 'famous', 'father', 'successful', 'composer', 'own', 'right', 'Senior', 'Strauss', 'forbids', 'son', 'seek', 'music', 'career', 'feeling', 'negative', 'side', 'celebrity', 'musician', 'life', 'harmful', 'son', 'attempts', 'seek', 'career', 'father', 'fear', 'jealousy', 'use', 'extensive', 'connections', 'music', 'worked', 'sabotage', 'son', 'son', 'leave', 'home', 'junior', 'starving', 'musician', 'selling', 'violin', 'lessons', 'food', 'famous', 'woman', 'opera', 'singer', 'who', 'help', 'career', 'undo', 'damage', 'father', 'Strauss', 'will', 'have', 'work', 'even', 'harder', 'be', 'famous', 'Waltz', 'King', 'find', 'love', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'recent', 'viewing', 'city', 'Vienna', 'concert', 'halls', 'combined', 'period', 'costumes', 'are', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'would', 'almost', 'steal', 'show', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'terrific', 'script', 'acting', 'music', 'wonderful', 'music', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'classical', 'music', 'will', 'sweep', 'away']",The Waltz King VHS
