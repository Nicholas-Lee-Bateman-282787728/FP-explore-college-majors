We watched it and totally fell in love with the music and the story itself. Un Monstre a` Paris is a family friendly movie about looking beyond our outer 'flea' shells and finding the beauty and love within us all. There are some crazy guys who get into some crazy trouble and create a monster that frightens all of Paris. However, a beautiful singer hears the monster singing (amazing singing voice) after they scare each other. She dresses him up in a stage costume to hide his scariness, and the two begin to grow in friendship over the love of music. There are bad guys, silly humorous scenes, and people learning to stand up for what is right, even if it's not what we think it should look like.

1514686,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B006E02GRK,California Dreaming,"[0, 1]","This film should have been really, really good.  It almost is.  But the main problem:  it seems that the director hedged his bets -- at least on the English-language version -- and over-Americanized this film to appease a New World audience.First of all, why didn't most of the main characters have French accents at least while speaking in English?  That surely would have been more charming.  From what I remember, the only character that had an accent was the female lead, and I thought that her character worked really well because of it.And there just aren't enough clever inside jokes to keep a truly adult audience interested.  While watching, I thought, ""OK.  It would be funny if, when the Flea Monster needs clothes, his 'friends' took him to a flea market.""  Sure, maybe it wouldn't have worked in all languages (does ""flea market"" even translate to French?) but at least I would have chuckled.  The first act, and maybe even the first half of the second, had just enough whimsy to keep my attention, but then by the third act I was almost ready to say ""au revoir.""  I just lost most interest by then.It seems that this was supposed to be a play on ""Beauty and the Beast"" (BATB), but the screenwriter abandoned that idea when this film went tumbling down the stairs outside the Sacre-Coeur, just as our flea protagonist did the same.  I won't tell you what happens with the love interest eventually (I've complained a million times before that a film does not always need a love interest, and I'm complaining again) but let's just say it doesn't go the BATB route.  And it almost makes no sense at all how this ends; it feels like an afterthought, as if the screenwriter and director didn't know how it should end.America likes to screw things up all over the world, such as introducing McDonalds into downtown Paris, and exporting drivel such as Disney wherever possible.  But really, if you're going to make a film about some French people, shouldn't it have some French style?

1514687,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B006E02GRK,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[2, 2]","You know, every time I watch a foreign country-made animated film that is great, and which is mostly ignored in the United States, it makes me angry and sad. It is a shame that the distribution forces of movies are not a plain-leveled field in our country, and the reasons for this are known and understood. Watching the delightful ""A Monster in Paris,"" a French production, I felt that way. It is one of those remarkable and passionate films that are totally family friendly, especially for children, which needs a wider audience.The story takes in Paris during 1910, and we are immediately introduced to some majestic animation recreating that period. We are also introduced to Emile, a projectionist in a movie theater; Maud (the lady in the ticket booth, which Emile is in love with, but is shy to admit); and Raoul, a good-natured businessman of all types, who makes a living distributing merchandise from his truck all over the city. One day, Raoul is giving Emile a ride, and takes him to one of his stops, which happened to be a scientist's laboratory. Raoul wants to go inside the lab because he is curious about the scientist's work, and against Emile's wish, as well as the Scientist assistant's (a monkey named Charles), they enter the building. The lab looks like a forest, as the scientist likes to work with plants. Sadly, Raoul begins playing with mixtures and formulas in the chemistry lab, and accidently creates a giant flea, which escapes the building. The giant flee, it turns out, is very special, but the ambitious and egotistical police commissioner wants to kill it. It is up to Emile, Raoul, Lucille (a beautiful singer), and Charles to save the day.""A Monster in Paris"" has everything that you want in a movie: a solid story, great characters, love and music, and state-of-the-art animation. The colors and attention to detail are astonishing, and you won't regret watching it. It is a little gem that deserves a second chance. The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy are the best deal ever.

1514694,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B006E02GRK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In European animation, Bibo Bergeron is well-known for his directorial work in ""Shark Tale"", his work for films such as ""Bee Movie"", ""Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas"", ""Flushed Away"" and the TV series ""Caillou"", ""Babar"" and ""Woofy"".In 2011, Bergeron and writer Stephane Kazandjian (""Modern Love"", ""Scalp"", ""Apres"") began working on the French CGI and 3D animated feature ""Un monstre a Paris"" (""A Monster in Paris"") which received critical acclaim for its music and performances by its lead talent.The film would star Mathieu Chedid (""Tell No One"", ""Arsene Lupin""), singer and actress Vanessa Paradis (""Girl on the Bridge"", ""Cafe de Flore"", ""Heartbreaker""), Gad Elmaleh (""The Adventures of Tintin"", ""Midnight in Paris"", ""The Valet""),  Francois Cluzet (""The Intouchables"", ""Tell No One"", ""Little White Lies""), Ludivine Sagnier (""Swimming Pool"", ""The Devil's Double"", ""Mesrine: Public Enemy #1&#8243;) and Julie Ferrier (""Heartbreaker"", ""Micmacs"", ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"").VIDEO:""A Monster in Paris"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  First let's take a look at the 3D version of ""A Monster in Paris"".  The film is pretty much one of those depth-based 3D animated films that proves to be much more effective towards the latter half via the action scenes of the film.  It's not the best use of 3D for an animated film, but I suppose this goes to show a difference between a heavily invested Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks Animation 3D film would benefit from a larger budget.  For the most part, the 3D is OK.As for the picture quality of the Blu-ray release, the film has a European style that is evident in British animated films, but for ""A Monster in Paris"", its strength is within its environments but also I like the French character design for its character models.  People should not expect the same type of animation as one would see on the more expensive, big budget animated films but by no means will I downgrade a film because of it.  I feel that ""A Monster in Paris"" is a beautiful looking film that shows that other countries can create beautiful animated films without the huge bankroll.  But also the film is in the capable hands of Bibo Bergeron (""Shark Tale"") which is a plus!Picture quality does feature a lot of detail, some scenes are vibrant and for the most part, the film looks very good in HD!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""A Monster in Paris"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  While dialogue is crystal clear featuring Adam Goldberg, Jay Harrington, Bob Balaban, Danny Huston and Catherine O'Hara.  Possibly what stands out in this lossless soundtrack are the music performances by Vanessa Paradis and Sean Lennon.The music is absolutely beautiful in this film and sounds incredible via lossless.  While the movie does utilize surround activity, especially moreso during the latter half of the film, its the environment that comes more to play in surround usage.  But for the most part, dialogue and music is crystal clear!Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""A Monster in Paris"" comes with trailer.EXTRAS:""A Monster in Paris"" comes with both the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy. Also, a slipcover case is included.JUDGMENT CALL:""A Monster in Paris"" is an entertaining animated family film that I enjoy for its beautiful and well-detailed Paris environment, enjoyable character design but also for its music.Of course, ""A Monster in Paris"" didn't have the luxury of a having a huge budget of a Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks animated film, and one shouldn't compare animated film from other countries with these big-budget films but still enjoy the animation and overall film.  The film is beautiful and its storyline is full of humor and fun.For younger children, the sight of a flea-like monster may scare some younger children and as my son had commented, ""too many kissing scenes"" for kids.  But other than that, its PG rating is mostly for a scene involving a gun being shot by the film's antagonist and mild rude humor.The film is in essence about three characters.  Raoul (voiced by Adam Goldberg) is a delivery man who has his own business but wants to make himself look successful (when he's really not) and wants to look very good in front of Lucille, an old childhood friend.Lucille (voiced by Vanessa Paradis) loves singing but the Le Prefet Maynott (voiced by Danny Huston) is more interested in wooing her and wanting to marry her.  And her boss, Madame Carlotta (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), encourages it.  But she has no interest in the man.  But now that she has spotted the talented Francoeur (voiced by Mathieu Chedid), a flea monster, she wants to help him and perform alongside with him, as he makes her performances much more vibrant.And Emile (voiced by Jay Harrington) is a projectionist who goes around with Raoul for his deliveries but he's a young man wanting to confess his love to Maud (voiced by Madeline Zima).As for the Blu-ray release, the film is colorful and vibrant in HD.  The Blu-ray 3D is good for its use of depth but not the best in terms of animated films in 3D.  The lossless audio is also very good as the action sequences utilizes the surround channels quite well.  But the film's music performance is fantastic and Vanessa Paradis and Sean Lennon do a wonderful job.  It's only lowpoint for this release is you would expect animated films to have a ton of special features, not the case for this Blu-ray release.One should not expect spectacular Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks Animation or a similar style with a magnificent budget to work with ""A Monster in Paris"", but one can expect very good animation and a fun family animated film for the entire family.Overall, ""A Monster in Paris"" is a fun family animated film worth recommending!",4,A film that showcases beautiful environments but also wonderful music.

I'm glad I did , because I found Monster In Paris to be a nice change from the usual shenanigans and over the top animated fair.The animation is very pleasing and refreshingly different than most animated films. The characters and French landscape are well illustrated in this charming and simple story.The music stands out and the songs are quite catchy, which helps round out this sweet little film, but if I have one gripe, it is that they should have included the original French soundtrack for the dialogue and songs. I've heard both versions and prefer the original song soundtracks.The combo pack is a little bit disappointing because of this as there are really no extra to speak of, a trailer ...that's it? If the French dialogue option had been included this could have been forgivable, but for a film that many Americans are not aware of, a making of would have been welcome as well as the addition of the original French soundtrack. This is an excellent film and deserves a little more than just a movie release. I should point out that the Blu Ray 3D and Blu Ray 2D are on one disc which is also a bit of a corner cutter, really how much so blanks cost....sheesh!Overall this is a wonderful little film that is very clean with no adult humor, but I found the film more for adults than little kids, I think they will enjoy it, but it isn't as chaotic as most animated films and they may get a little bored?

Loved the song, had to buy the movie.I was thoroughly enchanted by the story when I finally sat down to watch it.  The plot is irresistibly preposterous, Raoul (a delivery man with an inventor's aspirations) takes his friend Emile (a movie projectionist) with him on a delivery to the Botanical Gardens.  Just shy of breaking and entering, the two barge into the facility and through (almost) no fault of their own, create a gigantic flea with a talent for music.  As luck would have it, a local politician (Maynott), with dubious aspirations of his own, seizes on the hysteria that a monster is roaming Paris.  He promises to eradicate the beast in order to curry favor with the frightened populace and thus become their mayor.  It's at that point one begins to wonder who the real monster in Paris is (and that he will stop at nothing in order to achieve his goal).  Yes, there's an exciting chase sequence on land, sea, and air.  It's wondrous.  This movie is a lot of fun.  It's also incredibly sweet and charming.  I'm happy to include it in my DVD collection to watch again.

Set, lighting, effects are all there, thus increasing the enjoyment.Set in Paris in January of 1910, the Story revolves around an inventor/deliveryman, Raoul, and his theater projectionist friend, Emile.  Emile has the hots for a cashier at the theater, Maud, wanting to take the girl on a real date. Raoul delivers needed supplies to a local professor , but has to deal with the Professors handyman who happens to be a monkey instead, (Along with his endless and always ready supply of answer cards he flashes at everybody). Emile is testing a new motion camera and Raoul is acting out his scientist side and accidentally mixes two chemicals. Setting off a chemical explosion. Caught in the explosion is a ordinary flea off the monkey, and thus creating a huge monster but harmless that is the basis of our story. For part of the chemical reaction outside of making average plants huge, is to give the flea a wonderful singing voice. But the flea escapes the gardens and begins 'terrorizing' Paris.Enter Lucille, lead singer at the Rare Bird Cabaret whom Raoul has a secret crush on. She encounters the giant flea and hears him singing to himself and offers the creature shelter and protection. And to disguise him from an over ambitious Police chief. Lucille names the flea Franceour  and when she performs on stage her song 'La Seine', Franceour joins in, much to the audience delight.But the Police chief is determined to capture or better yet, kill &#34;the Monster&#34; and make a name for himself and actively pursues Franceoure.I will not spoil more, but needless to say, a happy ending. My only regret is that in the English version, the voice of Franceour is played by Sean Lennon, where the original voice is by Mathieu Chedid, better known by his performers name of M. Chedid is no stranger to singing in English (he sang in Triplets of Belleville) It would have been nice to hear him instead, though Lennon literally sounds like him.Lucille and Franceour's duet of 'La Seine' is perhaps the best part of the whole film.My one complaint is that the DVD doesn't offer a French language with English subtitles to truly catch the feeling of the film.But after watching this, I had to own the DVD.

1514700,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B006E02GRK,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[3, 4]","When buying videos for your children, it is wise to be cautious,...if only because you may end up having to watch anything you buy for them over and Over and OVER!  (""The horror!  The horror!"")  Movies you've all seen and enjoyed before are easiest.Movies you have never seen before, cannot recall being shown (or shown very long) in theaters, and (especially) have NEVER HEARD OF before should sound alarm bells.  Such was the initial case for A Monster in Paris with me, but a local retailer was recently playing it on all the TVs in their TV department, and I stopped to watch a bit...and found myself utterly surprised and enchanted into buying it.  In retrospect this film SHOULD have had an extensive US theatrical release because I believe it would have done very well.In a 1910 Paris experiencing record flooding (even the Eiffel Tower is approachable only by boat) four friends/acquaintances/potential future lovers are about to experience an extraordinary adventure.  Emile Petit, a movie theater projectionist, is too shy to confess his feelings for Maud, the ticket taker, despite the encouragement of Raoul, his friend who is in the delivery business.  Raoul imagines himself quite the lady's man (he isn't) and a brilliant inventor as well, largely based upon his home built delivery van Catherine, which is chock full of remote controlled features.One night while making a delivery to the Botanical Gardens accompanied by Emile, to an out of town Professor who has trained a remarkably intelligent (unrealistically, he communicates with written cards in a running gag reminiscent of the only funny bit in the otherwise awfulThe Pirates! Band of Misfits) proboscis monkey named Charles (Darwin, get it?) to be his assistant and in his absence a guard, Raoul decides to take advantage and start snooping around the Professor's laboratory.  The all too predictably disastrous results are to give Charles a beautiful singing voice, produce sunflower seeds that grow almost instantaneously into tree sized giants, and grow one of Charles' fleas into a seven-foot-tall monster, all of this recorded by Emile's new movie camera.The now sentient giant flea hops all over Paris generating panic and a fiendish plan to take advantage of said panic for his political advancement by the odious Commissioner Victor Maynott before ending up at the stage door of the club L'Oiseau Rare (The Rare Bird) and scaring the wits out of Lucille, a childhood frenemy of Raoul and the star cabaret singer of the club.  However, upon hearing the giant flea beautifully singing a sad and lonely song about being viewed as a monster (ridiculous, but if you buy the premise, you buy the bit), Lucille invites him to hide in her dressing room, names him Francoeur (meaning ""honest heart""), and gradually discovers him to be a musical prodigy of astonishing talent.But with an increasingly desperate and increasingly evil Maynott both hunting the ""monster"" and attempting to woo Lucille, just how long can she and her reluctant allies Emile and Raoul protect Francoeur?  A climactic struggle on the Eiffel Tower where Maud is awaiting the date Emile finally had the courage to ask her on tells the final tale.The animation truly is beautiful as is the music.  Normally, I take a dim view of anthropomorphizing obviously dangerous animals in this fashion (fleas are blood suckers so if a seven foot tall flea were even possible, which it isn't, it would be a hideously vampire like horror), but Francoeur earns his ""humanity"" by heroism above and beyond the call of duty.  Fans of the French original will be disappointed by the decision NOT to include the French language track; for the moment the only Region 1 solution is to track down the Canadian version, which is not available in Blu-Ray.Not to be missed!Note: There are a couple of nice Easter eggs, extra little scenes showing the draining of the Seine flood waters and a punishment fitting the crime, in the Credits, so be sure to watch them all the way to the end.Accidentally Conservative Movie Note: This is rather subtle, but there is definitely something interesting politically going on with the villains in this film.  The first villain is a snatch-and-grab thief; nothing very political there (at least not until the final Easter Egg), but the second villain is a sniveling cowardly weasel of a worthlessly arrogant and lazy waiter who fancies himself a (terrible!) singer of workers' protest songs, despite (or because of?) the fact he's never truly ""worked"" a day in his entire working life, an interesting apparent commentary.However, it's the third villain, the main villain who really raises eyebrows.  It is not simply that he is a selfish and amoral politician entirely consumed with pursuing his own ambitions (rather than the selfish and amoral businessman entirely consumed with pursuing his own ambitions we might have expected), rather it is the fact that he is a narcissist of Caligula-like proportions.  Most politicians arguably have a bit of narcissism in them, but our main villain goes far beyond the norm into the area of clinical excess.  He not only wants the world to revolve around him; he appears to believe it actually already does, at a point in his career when it clearly doesn't.  Thus, he is prone to making the most lunatic narcissistic outbursts right out in front of people with the apparent expectation  that all who hear him will agree with him...rather than have him locked up.  The thing is that if this character was intended as a parody of a real politician, there is truly only one world known political leader in living memory it could possibly be aimed at, a current one, one who actually responded publicly to acts of what can only be called pseudo-religious worship, not with the, ""You're creeping me out.  Stop that!"" you'd expect from any politician of any political stripe, but rather by BASKING in it and uttering narcissistic remarks only slightly less lunatic than any heard in this film.Which brings us to who is IMHO the fourth villain, the main villain's assistant.  Despite hearing almost every single lunatic outburst the audience has, this toady remains loyal until said main villain has gunned his way across Paris, endangering innocents every step of the way.  At some point the Loyal Supporter becomes morally complicit in the Madman's plans, and Captain Pate cuts it awfully close.Was it all just an accidentally conservative coincidence?  Or did the creators of this film demonstrate more guts than almost every other filmmaker on the planet?  Perhaps someday we shall know.",5,An Overlooked Pearl,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,6586,"['When', 'buying', 'videos', 'children', 'wise', 'be', 'cautious', 'only', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'having',

If that sounds like a mixed bag, it is, but somehow director Bergeron and screenwriter Stphane Kazandjian make it work.Even though the film recalls to mind some other works, it is one of the most unique animated features of recent years because it doesn't conform to the most common formulas, except perhaps after the leading lady (voiced by Johnny Depp's ex-partner, Vanessa Paradis) discovers the true nature of the monster -- and at one point, she says almost exactly the same thing Belle did to Gaston about who the real monster was.What sets it apart is the delightfully odd character design, ranging from broad caricature to an almost Rankin/Bass look. More than that, this is not your garden variety musical film. There are very few songs, in fact, and most originate on a stage setting. But Sean Lennon, who voices the creature, sings some very unconventional songs (as does Ms. Paradis) that are hard to describe unless you hear them -- Danny Elfman but not as dark, The Beatles but softer, Edith Piaf without suicidal tendencies. The most conventional pop song comes at the end, perhaps the one designed for airplay as so many such songs are.The music, like the dialogue, doesn't always stay true to the early 20th century French style so meticulously rendered in the visuals. Perhaps that was intentional too, as the story transcends its time and could have happened today as well as yesterday.Before I get to the other characters, I have to mention Catherine, who is a rickety delivery truck so dilapidated it can't decide which way to fall. Catherine isn't anthropomorphic, yet she steals the scenes in which she rattles along. She is driven by insufferably narcissistic Raoul (actor/musician Adam Goldberg), with his shy assistant, the film-loving Emile (Jay Harrington of Hot in Cleveland).The film does not rely on star voices. The most recognizable names in the cast are solid featured actors like Catherine O'Hara, Bob Balaban and John Huston's son Danny.The Blu-ray looks marvelous, capturing both the color and the grime of urban Paris, and though released in 3-D it holds up well without it, as there aren't a lot of scenes dependent on it.Sure would have been nice to have lots of bonus features, even if they had subtitles, as the Ghibli discs have. It is an artistically rich film and seeing a gallery might have been nice. There doesn't even seem to be a French language option. But budgets are an issue today, and it's nice to have the film anyway.",4,One of The Most Unique Animated Features of Recent Years,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,2693,"['have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'A', 'Monster', 'Paris', 'French', 'production', 'story', 'elements', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Hugo', 'Frankenstein', 'King', 'Kong', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'La', 'Vie', 'En', 'Rose', 'mixed', 'bag', 'somehow', 'director', 'Bergeron', 'screenwriter', 'Stphane', 'Kazandjian', 'make', 'film', 'mind', 'other', 'works', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'animated', 'features', 'recent', 'years', ""n't"", 'conform', 'most', 'common', 'formulas', 'perhaps', 'leading', 'lady', 'voiced', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'ex-partner', 'Vanessa', 'Paradis', 'true', 'nature', 'monster', 'one', 'point', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'thing', 'Belle', 'did', 'Gaston', 'who', 'real', 'monster', 'apart', 'delightfully', 'odd', 'character', 'design', 'ranging', 'broad', 'caricature', 'almost', 'Rankin/Bass', 'look', 'More', 'not', 'garden', 'variety', 'musical', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'songs', 'fact', 'most', 'originate', 'stage', 'setting', 'Sean', 'Lennon', 'who', 'creature', 'very', 'unconventional', 'songs', 'Ms.', 'Paradis', 'are', 'hard', 'describe', 'hear', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'not', 'dark', 'Beatles', 'softer', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'most', 'conventional', 'pop', 'song', 'end', 'perhaps', 'one', 'designed', 'airplay', 'so', 'many', 'such', 'songs', 'are.The', 'music', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'always', 'stay', 'true', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'French', 'style', 'so', 'meticulously', 'rendered', 'visuals', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'intentional', 'too', 'story', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'today', 'as', 'well', 'yesterday.Before', 'get', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'mention', 'Catherine', 'who', 'rickety', 'delivery', 'truck', 'so', 'dilapidated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'way', 'fall', 'Catherine', ""n't"", 'anthropomorphic', 'yet', 'scenes', 'along', 'driven', 'insufferably', 'narcissistic', 'Raoul', 'actor/musician', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'shy', 'assistant', 'film-loving', 'Emile', 'Jay', 'Harrington', 'Hot', 'Cleveland', '.The', 'film', 'not', 'rely', 'star', 'voices', 'most', 'recognizable', 'names', 'cast', 'are', 'solid', 'featured', 'actors', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'John', 'Huston', 'son', 'Danny.The', 'Blu-ray', 'marvelous', 'capturing', 'color', 'grime', 'urban', 'Paris', 'released', '3-D', 'up', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'scenes', 'dependent', 'it.Sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'lots', 'bonus', 'features', 'even', 'had', 'subtitles', 'Ghibli', 'discs', 'have', 'artistically', 'rich', 'film', 'seeing', 'gallery', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'French', 'language', 'option', 'budgets', 'are', 'issue', 'today', 'nice', 'have', 'film', 'anyway']",A Monster in Paris

When I learned there were no plans for a US release, I was rather disappointed, but I wouldn't let that deter me from seeing this movie.  In the end, I splurged and purchased two copies of the DVD (one for myself, one for our local library) from Amazon's Canadian store.Now seeing that there's an upcoming US DVD release, I'm kicking myself for not being more patient, but I don't regret having purchased this.  It's a beautiful movie, and while maybe not quite Pixar quality it's adorable and charming in its own right.""A Monster In Paris"" takes place in 1910 Paris, during the flooding of the Siene river, and focuses on a short, shy theater worker named Emile and his eccentric, bombastic friend Raoul, a delivery man who fancies himself an inventor.  While dropping off a package at a scientist's home, the two break into his laboratory and accidentally create the titular monster -- a seven-foot-tall, anthromorphic flea who can only communicate via singing.  Said ""monster"" is taken in by Lucille, a nightclub singer who names him Francoer and disguises him as a musician, and soon it falls on her, Emile, and Raoul to protect him from a ruthless comissioner who will stop at nothing to rid Paris of the creature.While the animation of ""A Monster In Paris"" isn't quite Pixar quality, I would put it on par with a Dreamworks movie, and it's certainly a cut above the animation of ""Ice Age"" and ""Despicable Me.""  The scenery shots of early 20th century Paris are gorgeous, and I never once saw a lapse in animation quality that was significant enough to jar me out of the story.  And the characters, with the exception of the appropriately villainous commissioner, are likable and quirky, with Francoer himself stealing the show -- who knew a giant flea could be so adorable?  The story of a group of people hiding a not-so-threatening monster from the authorities might not be the most original one in the world, but it doesn't seem old and tired here -- the new setting and the characters kept it from feeling stale.By far the best feature in this movie is the music.  I LOVE the music.  Renowned French singers Vanessa Paradis and M provide the vocals, and do a magnificent job.  It was a song that led me to find and fall in love with this movie, and the music that remains the best part for me.I watched this movie in the original French, with English subtitles (I always prefer to watch a movie in its original language), so I can't comment on the English dub.  I'll leave that for another reviewer.  UPDATE AS OF 1/28/13:  I recently re-watched this movie, this time in English.  The English dub is passable, but I highly prefer the French version.  The French voices sound more natural, and M makes a better voice for the monster than Sean Lennon.Wonderful movie, with gorgeous music and little to no adult humor or innuendo.

This flea is very warmhearted and has a beautiful singing voice, and so is befriended by a lovely Parisian singer and joins her show. A city commissioner with big ambitions takes aim at him however, hoping to inflate his popularity by publicly stamping out the 'monster'.

It isn't that we didn't enjoy the movie to a degree, but our family doesn't like to say OMG at all.  We just don't.  And it was uttered four times.  Usually, animated movies will say ""Oh My gosh!"" or ""Oh my goodness!""  but this one did not.  My children (6 and 8) actually got upset about it, and my 6 year old found the flea scary, not ""cute"" like I did.  Just found it interesting that our opinion was different than most peoples. It's not a movie we'll get out and watch very frequently, to be honest. Also, the music didn't impress me as much as it did some of the others.  Again, just a different opinion.

For me, this was just when it started getting good.I think anytime you watch a foreign film, there is that element of difficulty relating so it takes real genius to be able to cross cultures and reach the masses. Not only does the movie take place in Paris, it is also in the early 1900&#8242;s making it even less relatable.The plot is unique and I found the story to be quite adorable. The monster Franc receives assistance from an unlikely group of quirky characters to protect him from capture. While most see him as a scary monster, Lucille is the first to see past his exterior to what is within. What a great lesson to discuss with our kids!The animation in this is amazing and it's one of those movies that make you feel you are in the city which is even more remarkable considering it's a cartoon. I feel like I've been to Paris now. Everything was so believable and the characters are endearing once you get to know them.I also thought the music was amazing. The songs got stuck in head and Lucille's voice (Vanessa Paradis) is beautiful and spell-binding. When she opens her mouth to sing, everything stops. My kids even wandered back in when they heard it because it is so enticing.A Monster in Paris is a great family film because adults will enjoy it as well.
