He tries to track down the previous owners of the parrot and in the process finds love. I would have liked to see more of the parrot in the movie but the story is cute. There are some comical moments as well as more emotional threads all throughout. Both my husband and myself enjoyed this movie. My husband is the one who gave it 5 stars.

The chemistry between Rachel Nichols and Jackson Hurst was very believable.  You will laugh and cry in this film and if you must know...it has a happy ending.

Based on the Joe Coomer's novel, The Loop, it also offers comedy, drama, animals, mystery, tragedy all wrapped up in a satisfying package of goofiness and zip-up overalls.Lyman(Jackson Hurst) lives as the Lone Ranger.  A man of few words, mysterious past, he prefers isolation, living in annonymity in a trailer during the day, attending college on the forever plan to learn helpful skills and languages, but then at night, donning his mask, a set of overalls and a cap, to rescue those in need and clean up the messes of disasters that the world discards while working the highway courtesy patrol.  One day, a talking parrot flies into his place, and sets off a determined, noble quest by him to discover the bird's owner(s) and past and perhaps discover his as well.Enter Fiona(nicely done by Rachel Nichols)the school's librarian and her dog.  Drawn to those things unavailable, she relentlessly sets her sight on obtaining him.  He's a challenge, and she's up to it.  Cute, forward, obnoxiously flirtatious, but underneeth vulnerable and fragile in her own way, she upturns his life as she helps, unwantedly, to solve his mysteries.It's a comedy of opposites: his life ordered and apparently fixed, hers a mess like her car, named Sacajawea.  Fiona's life, though passionate, is flighty and temporary.  Lyman's, though noble, is empty and lonely.  It's  fun to watch the conflict of the two worlds, and how the real attachments and understanding start to grow.  She becomes smitten with him, and he starts to open up and join the human race and appreciate her.  But can he ever truly, love her, and can she get beyond just the romantic image she holds of him.  It's the joy of the journey, and there are some great cameos by the likes of veterans Buck Henry and Judith Ivy et al.The filming and directing are nicely done.  It's a low budget film with characterizations and oddities of life the emphasis.  The nighttime desert highway shots are both creepy and beautiful.Not a family tale, there are some tragic situations not shown in gratuity, mild language, some prelude to sex, but no real nudity.  Of note, both the main actors have done a lot of TV work and are good.  Rachel Nichols graduated from Columbia with dual degrees in economics and math and went on to modeling then acting.  Jackson Hurst graduated from Baylor with double majors in economics and management info systems with a minor in Spanish.",5,Love and Quirkiness and the Search for Self,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,2455,"['First', 'foremost', 'romance', 'Based', 'Joe', 'Coomer', 'novel', 'Loop', 'also', 'comedy', 'drama', 'animals', 'mystery', 'tragedy', 'wrapped', 'up', 'satisfying', 'package', 'goofiness', 'zip-up', 'overalls.Lyman', 'Jackson', 'Hurst', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'mysterious', 'past', 'isolation', 'living', 'annonymity', 'trailer', 'day', 'attending', 'college', 'forever', 'plan', 'learn', 'helpful', 'skills', 'languages', 'then', 'night', 'donning', 'mask', 'set', 'overalls', 'cap', 'rescue', 'need', 'clean', 'up', 'messes', 'disasters', 'world', 'discards', 'working', 'highway', 'courtesy', 'patrol', 'One', 'day', 'talking', 'parrot', 'flies', 'place', 'off', 'determined', 'noble', 'quest', 'discover', 'bird', 'owner', 's', 'past', 'perhaps', 'discover', 'well.Enter', 'Fiona', 'nicely', 'done', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'school', 'librarian', 'dog', 'Drawn', 'things', 'unavailable', 'relentlessly', 'sight', 'obtaining', 'challenge', 'up', 'Cute', 'forward', 'obnoxiously', 'flirtatious', 'underneeth', 'vulnerable', 'fragile', 'own', 'way', 'life', 'unwantedly', 'solve', 'mysteries.It', 'comedy', 'opposites', 'life', 'ordered', 'apparently', 'fixed', 'mess', 'car', 'named', 'Sacajawea', 'Fiona', 'life', 'passionate', 'flighty', 'temporary', 'Lyman', 'noble', 'empty', 'lonely', 'fun', 'watch', 'conflict', 'two', 'worlds', 'how', 'real', 'attachments', 'understanding', 'start', 'grow', 'smitten', 'open', 'up', 'join', 'human', 'race', 'appreciate', 'can', 'ever', 'truly', 'love', 'can', 'get', 'just', 'romantic', 'image', 'joy', 'journey', 'are', 'great', 'cameos', 'likes', 'veterans', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'Judith', 'Ivy', 'al.The', 'filming', 'directing', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'characterizations', 'oddities', 'life', 'emphasis', 'nighttime', 'desert', 'highway', 'shots', 'are', 'creepy', 'beautiful.Not', 'family', 'tale', 'are', 'tragic', 'situations', 'not', 'shown', 'gratuity', 'mild', 'language', 'prelude', 'sex', 'real', 'nudity', 'note', 'main', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'TV', 'work', 'are', 'good', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'graduated', 'Columbia', 'dual', 'degrees', 'economics', 'math', 'went', 'modeling', 'then', 'acting', 'Jackson', 'Hurst', 'graduated', 'Baylor', 'double', 'majors', 'economics', 'management', 'info', 'systems', 'minor', 'Spanish']",A Bird of the Air
