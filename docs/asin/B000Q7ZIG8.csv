The first hour contains a full ""concert"" of many thoughtful songs, in a peaceful setting with an audience. Then a wonderful kind of documentary on his life & career. Followed by a quiet, casual,  and thoughtful finale. We are left understanding him a great deal more. And I really now understand Peace Train, and the importance of Father and Son, as music and in his own life. He is a peaceful man we can learn from, and I thank him. Above all listen to his lyrics. There are teachers among us in life.",5,"Excellent music, documentary, and a look into his soul.",1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,584,"['must', 'now', 'admit', 'was', 'first', 'unsure', 'ordering', 'Wow', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'first', 'hour', 'full', 'concert', 'many', 'thoughtful', 'songs', 'peaceful', 'setting', 'audience', 'Then', 'wonderful', 'kind', 'documentary', 'life', 'career', 'Followed', 'quiet', 'casual', 'thoughtful', 'finale', 'are', 'left', 'understanding', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'really', 'now', 'understand', 'Peace', 'Train', 'importance', 'Father', 'Son', 'music', 'own', 'life', 'peaceful', 'man', 'can', 'learn', 'thank', 'listen', 'lyrics', 'are', 'teachers', 'life']",N/A
