Braun ""dbraun126""","[2, 2]","If you've seen ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or ""Gladiator,"" (for examples) you know how much extraordinary music can add to the overall emotional drama of the story.I was sadly surprised to discover that the original music score for ""Winterhawk"" (on VHS) has been replaced by a piano dub that reminds one of the silent movies of old.The story, natural cinematography, special effects and authenticity of the period, are still intact, but I can't give the release five stars as I would otherwise. The racing piano is just too annoying to ignore. I still have a VHS copy somewhere, taped from a television showing, that is the original theater release.

376160,A1MMHWECXEUVRR,630347117X,"Harrell Rumfield ""Fan of Good Movies""","[20, 22]","This movie may be low budget, and the dialog mediocre, but the actors, such as Leif Ericons, L Q Jones, Denver Pyle and Dawn Wells, do a good job of carrying it off.  I own the VHS, but I say this move long ago and seem to remember some scenes that were not on the tape.The story line is really not all that predictable.  Winterhawk, a Blackfoot chief, needs medicine for smallpox which is destroying his tribe.  His first encounter with the white traders is catastrophic, and he retaliates - for the era, it seems quite logical - he takes hostages to trade for the medicine.The ensuing chase presents some unforgettable scenery, and delves into the beliefs and philosophies of various groups.  This is not the typical ""bad Indians"" movie so many people were accustomed to in the 70's.  In that sense, it was ahead of its time.  A lot of people still won't like this movie for that reason.I gave this movie 4 stars because I think that in its way, it was a cutting edge effort, and as a history buff, it does a creditable job of showing the relationship between Indians and white hunters/settler/missionaries that existed at the time - not all of the bad guys were red.",4,Good Indians DO exist,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,1169,"['movie', 'may', 'be', 'low', 'budget', 'dialog', 'mediocre', 'actors', 'such', 'Leif', 'Ericons', 'L', 'Q', 'Jones', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'Dawn', 'Wells', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'carrying', 'off', 'own', 'VHS', 'say', 'move', 'long', 'ago', 'seem', 'remember', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'tape.The', 'story', 'line', 'really', 'not', 'predictable', 'Winterhawk', 'Blackfoot', 'chief', 'medicine', 'smallpox', 'destroying', 'tribe', 'first', 'encounter', 'white', 'traders', 'catastrophic', 'era', 'quite', 'logical', 'hostages', 'trade', 'medicine.The', 'ensuing', 'chase', 'unforgettable', 'scenery', 'beliefs', 'philosophies', 'various', 'groups', 'not', 'typical', 'bad', 'Indians', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'accustomed', '70', 'sense', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'lot', 'people', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'reason.I', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'think', 'way', 'was', 'cutting', 'edge', 'effort', 'history', 'buff', 'creditable', 'job', 'showing', 'relationship', 'Indians', 'white', 'hunters/settler/missionaries', 'existed', 'time', 'not', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'red']",Winterhawk VHS

The movie shows the good, bad and ugly of life during the 1800's. It is also a romance and love story between Winterhawk and white christian missionary girl. Charles B.
