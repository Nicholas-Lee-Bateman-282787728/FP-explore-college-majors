Lifeless, dreary, and humorless.  Perhaps has something to do with the depressing plot:  A loser janitor (Dylan Baker), listens to opera and has emotional and social issues.  Fast forward to he meets up with another loser (Hutton), and his loser shop-lifting wife (Stone).  Stone looks stoned.  Stone looks yucky.  Somewhere I lost interest. I think it was like right after the opening credits.  No.  Maybe it was the awful acting.  Still, it could have been the lack of a coherent plot, I don't really know or care.  But if you want a ""gripping psychological thriller"" as the box claims, then you'll do yourself a favor and keep looking.

1115114,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000XT1P5M,Grady Harp,"[15, 17]","The original title of this bleak flim - WHEN A MAN FALLS IN THE FOREST - was inexplicably shortened to the nebulous WHEN A MAN FALLS for the release of the DVD: had the original title been retained, the audience may have been given a clue as to the intended message of the story.  This is the second film for 26-year old writer/director Ryan Eslinger and it does suggest that he wants to deal with some existential material, but he has a way to grow into how to make it happen.The lives of three men and a woman are interconnected in the all too common shallow 'relationships' that are a major problem in how our society is working.  Bill (Dylan Baker) is a night janitor in a large company, a man who shuts out the boring world with his earphones connected to the great opera classics: he avoids people including those who saunter past him and those whose chaotic lives in the next door apartment distress him. Gary Fields (Timothy Hutton) is a down and out professional man who works in the building that Bill nocturnally keeps tidy, the two 'old high school acquaintances' meeting only because Gary has taken to sleeping in the office. Gary's wife Karen (Sharon Stone, without makeup and looking spent and used) has lost all feeling for living, detests Gary, and finds her only joy is in shoplifting.  Gary has shut himself off from old friends for reasons that seem to be related to an accident that involved is best friend Travis (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a man at odds with his own environment. The only apparent connection here is that, once Gary discovers that Bill is a night janitor,  Gary and Travis feel guilty that their response to Bill in high school had been one of cruel ridicule.  Each of the four main characters wanders aimlessly through a world that has become strange and vindictive and it is only a bizarre incident that throws the quartet into some semblance of meaning.  Each person has fallen, but since they are in the midst of a lonely 'forest', has anyone noticed or cared?This could be a study in personal tragedy were it done better, but despite the fine credentials of the actors, the script is so full of holes that character development suffers and what results is not unlike watching an injured bull struggling around a bullfight ring as the crowd attends to the matador et al. Sadly we just don't care about these damaged people, making connection with the film next to impossible. Maybe next film...Grady Harp, February 08",2,Disintegration of lives loosely connected,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,2456,"['original', 'title', 'bleak', 'flim', 'WHEN', 'MAN', 'FALLS', 'IN', 'THE', 'FOREST', 'was', 'inexplicably', 'shortened', 'nebulous', 'WHEN', 'MAN', 'FALLS', 'release', 'DVD', 'had', 'original', 'title', 'been', 'retained', 'audience', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'clue', 'intended', 'message', 'story', 'second', 'film', '26-year', 'old', 'writer/director', 'Ryan', 'Eslinger', 'suggest', 'deal', 'existential', 'material', 'way', 'grow', 'how', 'make', 'happen.The', 'lives', 'three', 'men', 'woman', 'are', 'interconnected', 'too', 'common', 'shallow', ""'relationships"", 'are', 'major', 'problem', 'how', 'society', 'working', 'Bill', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'night', 'janitor', 'large', 'company', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'boring', 'world', 'earphones', 'connected', 'great', 'opera', 'classics', 'people', 'including', 'who', 'saunter', 'chaotic', 'lives', 'next', 'door', 'apartment', 'distress', 'Gary', 'Fields', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'down', 'professional', 'man', 'who', 'building', 'Bill', 'nocturnally', 'tidy', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'acquaintances', 'meeting', 'only', 'Gary', 'taken', 'sleeping', 'office', 'Gary', 'wife', 'Karen', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'makeup', 'looking', 'spent', 'used', 'lost', 'feeling', 'living', 'Gary', 'only', 'joy', 'shoplifting', 'Gary', 'shut', 'off', 'old', 'friends', 'reasons', 'seem', 'be', 'related', 'accident', 'involved', 'best', 'friend', 'Travis', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'man', 'odds', 'own', 'environment', 'only', 'apparent', 'connection', 'here', 'once', 'Gary', 'discovers', 'Bill', 'night', 'janitor', 'Gary', 'Travis', 'feel', 'guilty', 'response', 'Bill', 'high', 'school', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'cruel', 'ridicule', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'wanders', 'aimlessly', 'world', 'become', 'strange', 'vindictive', 'only', 'bizarre', 'incident', 'quartet', 'semblance', 'meaning', 'person', 'fallen', 'are', 'midst', 'lonely', ""'forest"", 'anyone', 'noticed', 'cared', 'could', 'be', 'study', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'were', 'done', 'better', 'fine', 'credentials', 'actors', 'script', 'so', 'full', 'holes', 'character', 'development', 'suffers', 'what', 'results', 'not', 'watching', 'injured', 'bull', 'struggling', 'bullfight', 'ring', 'crowd', 'matador', 'et', 'al', 'Sadly', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'damaged', 'people', 'making', 'connection', 'film', 'impossible', 'Maybe', 'next', 'film', 'Grady', 'Harp', 'February', '08']",When a Man Falls

This character study focuses on four people, probably in their late 30s or early 40s (we really don't know, but the couple has a son who seems to be about 16), who for various reasons are unhappy with themselves, with their lives, and with each other. Unfortunately, since we do not know how any of them arrived at where they are, all we are given is a snapshot in time with no past reference points, which really does not allow the viewer to develop much empathy for any of the characters.

1115118,A207IYGZTAF0DS,B000XT1P5M,NoWireHangers,"[5, 6]","""When a Man Falls"" has three central characters. Bill is a shy janitor who works during the nights and only seems to really come alive in his dreams when he's sleeping during the days. Gary has trouble at work and in his relationship and his wife, Karen lives out her frustrations by shoplifting. A fourth character is Gary's old friend from high school, Travis, who still hasn't gotten over a traffic accident seven years ago.The movie was originally titled ""When a Man Falls in the Forest"", obviously a reference to the old philosophical riddle, ""if a tree falls in the forest, and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" As expected with such a title, the focus of the movie is the characters. There's not much of a story. It is sort of like ""Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her"", only with fewer characters. Your enjoyment of the movie will depend on whether you enjoy that type of movies. If you're looking for a movie with a typical plot you may be disappointed. If you like character studies, give it a try. The characters could have been more developed, especially Pruitt Taylor Vince's. And Bill does not feel as much as an original character as someone from a TV movie with William H Macy. But the actors all do a very good job.

He may lose his job and go to jail, although he doesn't discuss the matter with his friend or wife. He drinks and take sleeping pills to help him escape life.Karen (Sharon Stone) is married to Gary. She has passed the ""let's talk about the relationship"" stage and wants to live a separate life. She is depressed about getting old and losing her looks. She resorts to shop lifting to escape boredom.Bill (Dylan Baker) is the night time janitor. He went to school with Gary and Travis and is a recluse who attempts to live his life in a world of lucid dreaming. His apartment building doesn't afford him that luxury as he is forced to interact with the world.Travis (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is Gary's old friend. They have recently got back together. Travis likewise is a semi-recluse since his wife died in a car accident.Sadie (Stacie Bono) is Bill's neighbor who gets into loud fights with her husband. She attempt to makes friends with Bill, who can only fantasize about her.Will (David Wiliams) is the son of Gary and Karen. We find out about him about two thirds through the story.The movie is about how people's lives get into ruts that spiral downwards. These downward spirals are connected to each other. In order to break out of it, a drastic measure is required. Acting was good, but this is not a film most people would want to watch.
