1614382,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B00ANN8SOY,Jason A. Miller,"[1, 1]","I'm not ashamed.  With my wife out of town on a business trip, and with me having to cancel a trip to LA due to ridiculous amounts of snow in NY, I spent my bitterly lonely Valentine's Day with only &#34;The Room&#34; the room for company.  When it was over, I did not feel lonely at all.  My heart now sings praise to this movie, which made my otherwise solitary evening, an exercise in joy.&#34;The Room&#34; is a laugh-a-minute disaster.  Intended by Tommy Wiseau, its star/writer/director/producer, to combine the passion of a Tennessee Williams play with the gut-punch drama of &#34;The Talented Mr. Ripley&#34;, &#34;The Room&#34; instead is a disjointed series of non-sequiturs, brought to life with the most inexperienced cast and limpest production values imaginable.  Wiseau, who resembles that one vampire who was most decidedly NOT given the secret of perpetual youth to go along with his eternal life, is done no favors by the high-definition release -- but that, perversely, makes &#34;The Room&#34; look even better.Johnny, a benevolent man pushing age 50 who inexplicably surrounds himself with people less than half his age, is meant to be a tragic hero -- betrayed by his protege (who dabbles in drugs), his girlfriend (a game actress named Juliette Danielle, who was very wise to drop her last name for the production) and his best friend (played by Greg Sestero, who survived the production ordeal to write &#34;The Disaster Artist&#34;, one of the funniest memoirs ever published).  Everything Johnny does in this movie comes back to bite him.  The fact that he looks even more ghastly in HD, only helps to sell the joke that is Johnny.&#34;The Room&#34; takes place mostly on the ground floor of Johnny's impossibly small duplex, decorated with pictures of spoons.  The upstairs bedroom is used for soft-core love scenes that even Cinemax would be embarrassed to air, and the building's rooftop has a stairwell that magically changes places.  Each conversation is disjointed, with the dialogue (40% of which is greetings and salutations -- &#34;Oh, hi, Mark!&#34;) truly befitting an author who learned English as a third language.  The female characters in the film all fail the Bechdel test so badly that you'd think the whole point of the screenplay was to flip off the estimable Ms. Bechdel in the first place.This movie rose to cult status when a critic when a critic wrote of it, &#34;Watching this movie is like being stabbed in the head.&#34;  But that's not true at all.  This movie is a gift that keeps on giving.  It is the cure for whatever ails you and it is impossible to come away without feeling better about yourself.  No matter how bad your life was before you pressed &#34;play&#34;, when the end credits roll, you will feel so much better about yourself, because there is only one Johnny in this world, and you're not him.",5,Don't like it?

This time, the higher-quality release stood out, and did improve the experience.You can see the veins on the side of Tommy's face.  Lisa's green eyes really jump out.  And Mark's shaved face really stuns.But I'm not here to talk about the movie.  I'm just focusing on the Blu-ray specifically.The transfer is.. mostly pretty good.  There are still a few shots out of focus, but that's the source material.  What bothers me is that there were three or four instances of there being missing frames.  It would be playing along normally, then the motion would jump forward a tiny bit.  These are very short errors.  I rewound a little, and played those bits a few times to make sure that it wasn't a playback issue.There's an added extra that is very fun, especially compared to the DVD extras.  All of those extras made it over.I'd say the biggest barrier to buying this disc is the price.  I felt more strongly about that at first, but if you consider that the money is directly supporting Wiseau, it's worth it.",4,"Specifically, the Blu-ray release",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,1177,"['bought', 'year', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'yesterday.Every', 'time', 'watch', 'Room', 'discover', 'something', 'else', 'time', 'higher-quality', 'release', 'stood', 'out', 'did', 'improve', 'experience.You', 'can', 'see', 'veins', 'side', 'Tommy', 'face', 'Lisa', 'green', 'eyes', 'really', 'jump', 'out', 'Mark', 'shaved', 'face', 'really', 'stuns.But', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'talk', 'movie', ""'m"", 'just', 'focusing', 'Blu-ray', 'specifically.The', 'transfer', 'is..', 'mostly', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'shots', 'focus', 'source', 'material', 'What', 'were', 'three', 'four', 'instances', 'being', 'missing', 'frames', 'would', 'be', 'playing', 'along', 'normally', 'then', 'motion', 'would', 'jump', 'forward', 'tiny', 'bit', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'errors', 'rewound', 'little', 'played', 'bits', 'few', 'times', 'make', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'playback', 'issue.There', 'added', 'extra', 'very', 'fun', 'especially', 'compared', 'DVD', 'extras', 'extras', 'made', 'over.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'biggest', 'barrier', 'buying', 'disc', 'price', 'felt', 'more', 'strongly', 'first', 'consider', 'money', 'directly', 'supporting', 'Wiseau']",N/A

Tommy Wiseau's cinematic masterpiece, The Room, is a one of a kind experience that will never be equaled. It's a story of friendship, love, betrayal, football, chocolate (the symbol of love), football, chickens (cheep cheep cheep cheep), drugs, and football. Made in 2003, The Room changed the way people watched movies and saw the world forever!Johnny (played by writer/director/producer/executive producer/star Tommy Wiseau) is a successful banker living in San Francisco with his fiance Lisa (Juliette Danielle, who will go down in history as one of the greatest movie villains of all time). But Lisa is bored with Johnny and need some excitement. So she decides to have a fling with Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero, who's previous credit includes his Oscar nominated performance as Andre Toulon in the 1999 box office smash, Retro Puppet Master), much to Mark's charging. Meanwhile, Johnny's ward, Denny (Philip Haldiman) is dealing with the burden of growing up and dealing in drugs. Also meanwhile, Lisa's mother, Claudette (Carolyn Minnott, who's understated performance will bring tears to your eyes) must come face to face with her own mortality when she discovers she definitely has breast cancer.The key to this entire story of course is Mr. Wiseau himself. this is a man who's facial expression says ""Where am I?"" He sports a physique that makes one say ""I think he works out, but he could also be a reanimated corpse."" There has never been a performance like this, nor will there ever be. Wiseau makes Sir Laurence Olivier look like a crazy homeless guy; I guarantee you that sometime soon you'll be hearing of Mr. Wiseau being knighted because he's just that awesome. You will never see a movie with more quotable lines, or grown men tossing around the old football like this movie. Some may question just why this movie is called The Room, when it clearly takes place in multiple locations. You see, the title is referring to the room in which you the viewer are watching this masterpiece of a film. The movie is subtly telling you that you must escape your world of slacking about and eating junk food, and must go out and play some football.I have yet to get this film on Blu-ray, but I think I'll wait for the price to go down for a little. I don't think there's a commentary by the majestic Wiseau, and that's just a darn shame as the man is an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a conundrum wrapped in a tuna and peanut butter sandwich. But remember folks, never watch this movie alone, have one or more friends with you.

It's so bad, full of plot holes, inconsistencies, random sub-plots, terrible acting, and lame dialog, but that's what makes this disaster so awesomely hilarious. It's an art of itself and it's a masterpiece! I can tell this was meant to be a serious drama, but because of Wiseau's hilariously bad acting skills, this movie is now billed as a 'black comedy' Wiseau plays a character named Johnny. Johnny is a banker who is head-over-heels in love with his 'future wife' Lisa. Out of the blue, Lisa is bored of Johnny and begins to have an affair with Mark, Johnny's best friend, which they mention 20 or 30 times. Denny is a weird creepy awkward teen that Johnny looks after, who also lusts for Lisa. There are other many random characters such as Mike and Michelle, Chris-R the drug dealer, Peter the psychologist, Claudette the mother of Lisa who tells her to stay with Johnny.
