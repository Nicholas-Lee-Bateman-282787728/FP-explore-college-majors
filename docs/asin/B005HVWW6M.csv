1461376,A29GGWB3GGQBO9,B005HVWW6M,GPeralta,"[5, 6]","With Yu Yu Hakusho having been released in its entirety in both DVD and Blu Ray formats, the only thing left for Funimation to do was release the movie and OVA. Even their ad campaign for this release hyped it up by telling buyers to complete their collection with this release... probably because there isn't really anything else positive you could say to sell it.This release collects what are essentially the table scraps from the ever-so delicious main course that was the series, packaging the first movie from the series as well as a number of shorts--neither of which really add anything of real value to the main series itself. The movie is short, clocking in at 25 minutes and is your basic one-shot story with the heroes taking on a cookie-cutter villain with little to no emotional connection with any of the characters. It's neither horrible nor is it Emmy-winning gold; it's just your standard action anime movie from the early '90s with a basic plot of good vs. evil with my only gripe being that a majority of the film was spent racing to the bad guy's lair while fighting hordes of minions rather than fleshing out the villains to make me really hate them for the finale of the movie.The remainder of the room on the first disc in this release consist of a short collection of old Funimation promos (interesting, though I would have preferred they get their hands on some of the Toonami and adult swim promos from back in the day) as well as the more substantial parts of what make up Eizou Hakusho--a collection of shorts that take place throughout the continuity of the main series. The first thing I noticed when watching through these shorts was the quality of everyone's voice acting in the English dub--particularly Justin Cook and Chuck Huber as Yusuke and Hiei, respectively. Cook's take on Yusuke is noticeably deeper than previously in some of the shorts, while Huber's tone as Hiei is missing the slight hint of malice, probably lost due to having voiced the comical father in Shin Chan as of late. As for the shorts themselves, they range in quality from the goofy nonsensical piece titled ""Nightmare Hakusho"" to a bit more relevant to the main series in the form of Koto interviewing the main cast before their fight with Team Toguro in the Dark Tournament as well as some bits that make up an epilogue of sorts. While it was interesting to see the origins of the group picture seen in the closing animation ""Sayonara Bye-Bye"" (a theme song that pops up multiple times throughout the first disc) as well as knowing that the kiss shared by Keiko and Yusuke at the series' finale was actually their second, the shorts as a whole don't exactly give off the same feel that the main series did for me and is only worth a watch or two just to say you watched them.The first disc also includes a textless version of the movie's opening and ending theme (explaining why they're in widescreen rather than full screen). Normally, I wouldn't even bother mentioning this as an extra since Funimation tends to have these as standard for most of their releases. However, there's another section in the first disc's menu titled ""Opening and Ending Encyclopedia,"" collecting the opening and endings of the entire series in textless form in their right aspect ratio. The OP and ED Encyclopedia also collects a number of shorts, which I found rather misleading since one would just assume it to collect the opening and ending animations from the series and nothing more. There's also a cover of ""Sayonara Bye Bye"" by the English voice actress of Yukina, making for the song showing up a total of four times on this disc (at the end of the movie, textless form in 16:9 and 4:3 aspect, and now this cover). The last batch of extras on this first disc are some anti-piracy clips done in-character by the main cast (um... and Toguro, interestingly enough). Both the English and Japanese versions of these make reference to it being a while since last seen, which is an interesting point to note. The last parts of Eizou Hakusho were released in Japan on VHS in '96--a good two years after the final episode of the series aired in Japan in '94. Meanwhile, we get this release a whopping five years after the last episode aired in the US. Regardless of the language preference, I think most fans can agree that the success of this release relied heavily on nostalgic fans who wanted something new after all these years--no matter the quality, which brings me to the second disc.While the contents of the first disc ranged in quality, practically everything found on the second disc was straightup garbage. We're presented with a clipshow from the main series, piecing together the individual stories of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei, and Kurama. The picture quality is noticeably more washed out when comparing with the quality from the main series as released in Funimation's season sets (see comparisons in amazon's gallery of this release) which only further turns me off to its contents and for a while made me want to upgrade my collection of the main series from DVD to Blu Ray before I realized the problem was with this disc and not the rest of the series. The only real things of substance on the second disc would be the new animation sequences for each character. However, the picture quality is again a washed out VHS quality and can only be found after fast-forwarding through the clip show, which constantly reminds you that the series was made in the '90s, what with its cheesy karaoke-style scene transitions. This is only made more apparent in the parts on this disc that switch from clips from the show to still frame images that look like they were made by a grade schooler that just learned how to use Windows Movie Maker. The final nail in the coffin is the fact that absolutely nothing on this second disc has been dubbed in English--with the Japanese subbed version being the only option here. I find it odd that the original English cast would get together to dub all the other clips, but leave the ones on this second disc untouched. Listening to in-character songs by the English cast would have been a real hoot and honestly would have boosted up my view of this release significantly.To sum things up, this release collects what should have probably been dispersed throughout Funimation's four season sets as extras. Listing everything out, there's a good amount of material, but the run time of each item is too short and even when collected together doesn't exactly warrant a single release, especially at the price being asked for. I personally paid $10 for this release, which I think as about as high up as anyone should be willing to go to to pay for this release.As a side note, there is a second Yu Yu Hakusho movie that would truly complete your collection of the series.Yu Yu Hakusho: The Movie Poltergeist Reportwas released by US Manga Corps which is probably why Funimation couldn't get their hands on it for this release. As such it's English dub is a completely different cast. Regardless, it's an interesting bit of YYH history, with really nice animation, that makes up for its lackluster story.",3,"Sayonara Bye-Bye, Yu Yu Hakusho",1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,7138,"['Yu',

I was excited because this completed the collection for me however I was disappointed in the fact that the extras that come with the film were basically extra scenes of screaming and some dialogue for each character.

I found the ""movie"" to be enjoyable but like this entire release I find it to be for true fans only and fans of the series. If someone were to randomly buy this set without viewing all/most of Yu Yu Hakusho the series I doubt they'd really enjoy it especially not knowing about the characters and all that. I loved that Funimation gathered the entire voice acting crew back together for this late final release, after I got done watching all of these clips it made me want to rewatch YYH completely all day but it also made me wish that there was more to the series.The second disc is in its original Japanese language but does feature English subtitles by Funimation. So it kind of sucked that it wasn't all in English but its still a great thing to add to this release.Overall I give this a 5/5 because I've been a fan of the series since childhood, almost 10 years now I've been watching Yu Yu Hakusho and this was a fantastic release on Funimation's part, I really couldn't ask for much more besides the second disc being in English too but Funi couldn't get the copyright rights to the music they said, so what can you do.

1461383,AMJYNF6FI9JDM,B005HVWW6M,"Saito Hajime ""My reviews are short and sweet....","[3, 6]","Disc 1:First, I'll explain what you are getting here. Yu Yu Hakusho the Golden Seal was a double-billed movie(alongside another anime series movie, Ninku) released in Japan, at a whopping 25 minutes. It even includes the opening and endings from the series so really it is about 20 minutes. Its widescreen and clearly has been remastered and is near the picture quality of the blu-ray series.The entire english dub cast has been reunited for all the new stuff in this release and it is the main reason that this movie was enjoyable at all. The movie itself is rushed and frankly terrible, but its good to see the band back together.Next you get the extras from the eizou hakusho ovas(I'll explain those when I get to disc 2). They are basically all fanservice and non-essential whatsoever, except for the fact that they are also fully dubbed by the legendary english cast as well. The picture quality of these extras is vhs quality, most likely b/c thats what they were intended for was Japanese vhs releases, and the original film masters must have been lost or something.They ranged from amusing to meh.Then you get to the opening and ending encyclopedia extra, which was the best part of this entire set. It takes place AFTER the end of the series, and there really isn't any new development other than showing that Yusuke is running his own ramen stand, but if you are a fan, I guarentee you will love this extra. It made the entire set worth while.Disc 2:I can imagine in the early 90's in Japan, a vhs with a bunch of fight clips set to music sung by the actual characters would have been awesome. Now...ehh. This disc is only really cool because it has an original music video for each character with completely new animation. Theres also a few funimation trailers. That's it. :/Theres really not as much here as Funimation would like you to think. (Unless you like watching grainy subbed recaps set to old Japanese music.

1461384,A1G2Y89G496IF0,B005HVWW6M,Terry,"[1, 1]","Eizou Hakusho and Yu Yu Hakusho The movie, have been elusive to  fans of the series and the Funimation English dub for years now. Stuck watching both online OR buying the dvd of The Movie from a different dubbing company (I actually liked the voices for that btw), it seemed that the OVA would never reach outside of Japan and that the movie wouldn't have the most familiar cast (the Funimation crew who dubbed the series).The wait is over! Now compiled in this 2 disc set are the movie and Eizou Hakusho (the collection of shorts animations featuring the main characters). And it was awesome to pop it into the player for the first time.Firstly, the dub was well done with matching words, true to character dialouge and over all smooth acting. Nice to hear these things without needing subtitles. The menus were laid out, everything was in order, it was just nice to have everything so nicely organized.A bonus is that when on the second disc which includes character specific animations with character songs, they put the translations for the music being sung AND the title so that you may find them later if you wish.Over all, if you are a fan of this series, this would definitely be for you! However, if you are a casual viewer not familiar with at least the mangas or original series, I wouldn't recommend it because of how specific it is, how odd some of the aspects of the shorts are, it wouldn't be as enjoyable for you. So all you Hakusho fans, we've waited a long while so pick this DVD set up while you have the chance because it was AWESOME!",5,Good to hear the characters in English now :),1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,1554,"['Eizou', 'Hakusho', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'elusive', 'fans', 'series', 'Funimation', 'English', 'dub', 'years', 'now', 'Stuck', 'watching', 'online', 'OR', 'buying', 'dvd', 'Movie', 'different', 'dubbing', 'company', 'actually', 'liked', 'voices', 'btw', 'seemed', 'OVA', 'would', 'never', 'reach', 'Japan', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'most', 'familiar', 'cast', 'Funimation', 'crew', 'who', 'dubbed', 'series', '.The', 'wait', 'Now', 'compiled', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'are', 'movie', 'Eizou', 'Hakusho', 'collection', 'shorts', 'animations', 'featuring', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'awesome', 'pop', 'player', 'first', 'time.Firstly', 'dub', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'matching', 'words', 'true', 'character', 'dialouge', 'smooth', 'acting', 'Nice', 'hear', 'things', 'needing', 'subtitles', 'menus', 'were', 'laid', 'out', 'everything', 'was', 'order', 'was', 'just', 'nice', 'have', 'everything', 'so', 'nicely', 'organized.A', 'bonus', 'when', 'second', 'disc', 'character', 'specific', 'animations', 'character', 'songs', 'put', 'translations', 'music', 'being', 'sung', 'title', 'so', 'may', 'find', 'later', 'wish.Over', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'However', 'are', 'casual', 'viewer', 'not', 'familiar', 'least', 'mangas', 'original', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'how', 'specific', 'how', 'odd', 'aspects', 'shorts', 'are', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'enjoyable', 'all', 'Hakusho', 'fans', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'long', 'so', 'pick', 'DVD', 'set', 'up', 'have', 'chance', 'was', 'AWESOME']",Yu Yu Hakusho: Eizou Hakusho OVA

The Japanese dub are on Disc 2 and English (All cast are back!) dub is on disc 1, and as the last  reviewers said the due to lisencing issues or not getting the material funimation needed to dub the Songs (Theme song which each of the 4 main characters sing) into english so they left it in sub but i say it least it still including with this set.For me, when i heard that this one was finally coming to the U.s.a. me and my friends couldn't be any happier as we pre-order our own copies and watch it together. I couldnt say anymore but thanks to what funimation has done from even picking up this awesome series and tanleted voice cast than what other companies would have done. So For that i give it 5 stars.  I for one can't wait for funimation does next and i hope they will redub the 2nd movie as well. Or else this 2-disc is a must have for almost any YYH fans!",5,Thank you for finally picking this up funimation!,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,1859,"['see', 'other', '3', 'review', 'kind', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'now', 'pre-order', 'buy', 'now', 'Dvd', 'i', 'dont', 'think', 'i', 'need', 'say', 'much', 'info', 'i', 'do', 'however', 'will', 'give', 'u', 'little', 'simple', 'one', 'everything', 'release.Yu', 'Yu', 'hakusho', 'movie-As', 'other', 'explain', '20-30', 'min', 'clip', 'gang', 'trying', 'rescue', 'Keoma', 'Who', 'kidnappers', 'need', 'golden', 'seal.EIZOU', 'Hakusho', 'Ova-', 'Which', 'short', 'clips', 'gang', 'tv', 'series', 'ended', 'seeing', 'Yusuke', 'owning', 'ramen', 'shop', '3', 'friends', '2nd', 'demon', 'tourment', 'including', 'kawabarwa', 'Very', 'nice', 'watch', 'secret', 'reveal', 'wasnt', 'series.Nightmare', 'Hakusho-Another', 'shory', 'clips', 'time', 'set', 'yusuke', 'dream', 'i', 'find', 'very', 'creepy', 'very', 'funny', 'watch.Scenes', 'Dark', 'TourmentAnti-piracy', 'clipsYYH', 'Opening', 'ending', 'Enyclopedia', 'i', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'have.Textless', 'SongsVintage', 'trailerAnd', 'one', 'more', 'important', 'thing', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'are', 'Disc', '2', 'English', 'cast', 'are', 'back', 'dub', 'disc', '1', 'last', 'reviewers', 'said', 'due', 'lisencing', 'issues', 'not', 'getting', 'material', 'funimation', 'needed', 'dub', 'Songs', 'Theme', 'song', '4', 'main', 'characters', 'sing', 'english', 'left', 'sub', 'i', 'say', 'least', 'still', 'including', 'set.For', 'when', 'i', 'heard', 'one', 'was', 'finally', 'coming', 'U.s.a.', 'friends', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'pre-order', 'own', 'copies', 'watch', 'together', 'couldnt', 'say', 'anymore', 'thanks', 'what', 'funimation', 'done', 'even', 'picking', 'up', 'awesome', 'series', 'tanleted', 'voice', 'cast', 'what', 'other', 'companies', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'So', 'i', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'funimation', 'next', 'i', 'hope', 'will', 'redub', '2nd', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'else', '2-disc', 'must', 'have', 'almost', 'YYH', 'fans']",Yu Yu Hakusho: Eizou Hakusho OVA
