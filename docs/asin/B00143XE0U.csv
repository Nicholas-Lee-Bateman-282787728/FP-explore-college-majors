1144975,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,B00143XE0U,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[0, 0]","This film is notable for being the only film Sinatra directed...and he also produced and undertook this production and at the time it came right after von ryan's express(1965)which was a big hit but this wasnt. Unlike the other members of the rat pasck Sinatra took himself,his singing and his films,seriously,and on stage he was always serious and the others around him provided comedy relief. His films as this one testifies(although he did many comedies and campy type films as well)owes much to the peace sentiment of the times. Here he's playing a character like the european whisky priest in the fugitive(1947)starring henry fonda,and the film is situated somewhere in the pacific where a group of japanese and americans find themselves at war. Much of the film involves strategic battles,including at the end where the japanese group is massacred by Sinatra's troops and the camera slowly rolls over the massacre,giving us the horror of war,and the didactic message no one wins at war. The character he portays gives at times religious sentiments,talks of fornicators(others) and seems to wish he was somewhere else,he seems emotionally insulated from everything,and he talks at times laments and instructs about life,but briefly but that's the role he plays here,and there's an interesting bit where they barter the medics services to perform an operations for supplies in short supply, al long sequence with a buddhist priest and a makeshift hut hospital,a very good scene. A very 60's type film,and these types of characters would find there way into MASH which became a big commercial hit...here the platoon is administered in top form and no nonsense like by an army commander who has little interest in the tirades of the Sinatra character.",3,compelling war drama,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,1753,"['film', 'notable', 'being', 'only', 'film', 'Sinatra', 'directed', 'also', 'produced', 'undertook', 'production', 'time', 'came', 'right', 'von', 'ryan', 'express', '1965', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'wasnt', 'other', 'members', 'rat', 'pasck', 'Sinatra', 'took', 'singing', 'films', 'seriously', 'stage', 'was', 'always', 'serious', 'others', 'provided', 'comedy', 'relief', 'films', 'one', 'testifies', 'did', 'many', 'comedies', 'campy', 'type', 'films', 'well', 'much', 'peace', 'sentiment', 'times', 'Here', 'playing', 'character', 'european', 'whisky', 'priest', 'fugitive', '1947', 'starring', 'henry', 'fonda', 'film', 'situated', 'somewhere', 'pacific', 'where', 'group', 'japanese', 'americans', 'find', 'war', 'Much', 'film', 'strategic', 'battles', 'including', 'end', 'where', 'japanese', 'group', 'massacred', 'Sinatra', 'troops', 'camera', 'slowly', 'massacre', 'giving', 'horror', 'war', 'didactic', 'message', 'one', 'war', 'character', 'times', 'religious', 'sentiments', 'talks', 'fornicators', 'others', 'wish', 'was', 'somewhere', 'else', 'emotionally', 'insulated', 'everything', 'times', 'laments', 'instructs', 'life', 'briefly', 'role', 'here', 'interesting', 'bit', 'where', 'barter', 'medics', 'services', 'perform', 'operations', 'supplies', 'short', 'supply', 'al', 'long', 'sequence', 'buddhist', 'priest', 'makeshift', 'hut', 'hospital', 'very', 'good', 'scene', 'very', '60', 'type', 'film', 'types', 'characters', 'would', 'find', 'there', 'way', 'MASH', 'became', 'big', 'commercial', 'hit', 'here', 'platoon', 'administered', 'top', 'form', 'nonsense', 'army', 'commander', 'who', 'little', 'interest', 'tirades', 'Sinatra', 'character']",N/A

If you choose to turn them off, you can't see what the Japanese are saying, and my Japanese is pretty rusty to say the least. If you turn the subtitles on however, you can see what the Japanese are saying, but then are forced to read what the Americans are saying as well. It's basically an 'all-or-nothing' deal, and it's somewhat distracting to the movie itself.

This was Frankie's baby and it was interesting to see that dynamic at work. First of all, the set was cool. Everything, the jungle, the warplanes and especially the water had a close-up feel to it and had a brilliant colour to it. The island looked like the set of Gilligan's Island (season 3)so it sure wasn't a gritty atmosphere. Secondly, the acting is bad. Stiff, wooden actors like veteran Clint Walker has the lead as a soft-hearted Captain who must lead his group of obviously unqualified losers while they crash on an uncharted island in the Pacific during WWII. His close friend, pharmacist (?) Franky helps Clint with morale support throughout the adventure of having a small core of Japanese misfits on the island along with them as their enemy. Another laugher is Tommy Sands as Marine Lieutenant Blair. Sands plays it straight as a tough talking wanabe brat coming up through the ranks and his acting in this one is great....well, funny anyway. What starts out as a lean mean killing machine of a Lieuutenant turns into mush as he's almost loved to death by the opposing side. Sinatra is too much as the guy just does not belong here! It was hilarious to watch him ham it up with his Vegas lingo while everyone around him tries very hard to be serious. He's loaded half the movie and I wonder if that was only in the scenes! The Japanese are just as vicious as each side threatens, trades fish for cigarettes, and even ask Frankie to amputate an enemy's leg in return for some potatoes and dried fish! Priceless I tell ya! This is hokey fun where everyone, including the Japanese Captain is as scary as a fly beating on your screen door. I have to believe that this movie wasn't supposed to be taken all that seriously, or was it? This was a Sinatra Production and, to me anyway, it was just a fun, big budget love-fest to show that Mr. S was in charge and doing it ""his way"". I usually look to see where a movie's at time-wise while watching it, and for some twisted reason I didn't do that here as I was enjoying this too much. Go figure. It's a keeper and it's beyond me why.

1144987,A276M3NSIY9B82,B00143XE0U,Harry Brewer,"[0, 0]","This is one of Sinatra's better vehicles. Some have criticized him as an actor but he proves himself to be more than capable in this movie. Sinatra was a multi-talented man, movies being his second vocation. The biggest problem with Sinatra, the actor, was he had a tendency to be lazy. He never liked to do more than two takes for any scene he was in. His claim was that a scene would loose its 'freshness' if more than two takes were done, that may be so but it led to some sloppiness.None But the Brave would be the fifth & final movie he would receive a producer credit, it's also the only movie he directed. Sinatra portrays Maloney, a corpsman. His role isn't the overshadowing role one would think he would cast himself into, after all, he was the producer & director. The screen time of the Japanese actor, Tatsuya Mihashi, is the actual starring role. He's the narrator of the movie &, in many ways, it's told from the Japanese perspective. Clint Walker portrays Capt. Bourke, the pilot of the plane that crash lands on the island. His role is as large as Sinatra's. Tommy Sands portrays the marine 2nd lieutenant who's on his first command. His portrayal is at times comical because he's so green & gung ho. It's a pretty good performance.The movie revolves between the two military groups who are at war with one another, both stranded with no means to communicate to their respective commands. It's an intelligently done movie, showing both sides of their humanity. What makes this movie different, especially for its time, is the way the Japanese are portrayed. They're presented as humans also, not just a mindless enemy. The Japanese officer proposes a peace so that both groups can survive. An uneasy peace ensues that's constantly in jeopardy of being destroyed. Both sides agree to the truce until a rescue team shows up, doesn't matter which side. The humanity of the film is touching especially when Maloney goes to the Japanese camp to amputate the leg of a Japanese soldier that has gangrene. There's a moment when both sides have to pull together as a team when a monsoon hits the island. All this, of course, is setting up the inevitable conflict between the Americans & Japanese in the final scene. It's sad to see this happen when the two groups have done so much to overcome their differences. But the other thing is they are soldiers who are loyal to their countries, bound to duty & defense of their homelands.

The Japanese soldiers were simply cutoff andforgotten on a small island, while trying to uphold the diginity and honor of serving the Emperor of Japan.Thrusted into their domain is a C-47 transport full of Marines, led by a gung-ho and an overacting Tommy SandsI thought. Clint Walker is the pilot and assumes command, while trying to keep everyone alive thru his experience.But the scene where their transport is being escorted by fighters is totaly so phony and almost laughable.The mid-air crash between the two fighters and when the transport crashes into the beach was done on a shoe string budget.Which really surpises me considering it has Sinatra's stamp on the movie. Maybe they were simply trying to save somemoney due to logistic filming cost? But any kid could tell these were simply models.Sinatra plays a Navy medic and seems to play his role well.

Released in 1965, it revolves around the story of a platoon of U.S. Marines during WWII whose transport plane is shot down by an enemy fighter plane over an island in the South Pacific occupied by another platoon of Japanese soldiers. Both groups find are marooned and out of communication with their main forces. They engage each other in a series of battles until both sides decide to arrange a truce in order to save the life of a Japanese soldier suffering from gangrene resulting from his wounds. The late Frank Sinatra plays the Marine's medic, who performs a chilling and suspenseful amputation on the wounded Japanese soldier in an attempt to save his life. Clint Walker is the American no-nonsense commander who negotiates the truce with the enemy commander. Both sides agree that if either unit establishes contact with their main force, the truce will end and combat will resume. This film also possesses a splendid music score composed by Johnnie Williams, now known as John Williams who composed the music for all of the Star Wars films along with many other well known films.

1144993,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00143XE0U,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I was very pleasantly surprised by this rarely seen film and I had good time watching it. It is the story about two hostile groups of soldiers who are both stranded on a small island with a minimum of resources and are also cut from their respective headquarters. Hard times making for strange bedfellows, their mutual relation, which begins with a bloody fight to death, slowly starts to evolve into a very unexpected direction...""None but the brave"" was the first and only film which Frank Sinatra directed (he also produced it). The film was literally destroyed by the critics in 1965 and it didn't fair well at box office -and frankly, in both cases I can not understand why. Maybe the general idea (about which more further), was ""too much and too early"" for those times, as a later film on the same theme, John Boorman's ""Hell in the Pacific"" faired much better.Sinatra's idea, very unusual for 1965, was to make the Japanese commander, Lieutenant Kuroki, the main narrator of the story, by the way of successive entries in his personal journal (a little bit like what Clint Eastwood used later in ""Letters from iwo Jima""). Another unusual but clever Sinatra's idea was to leave the main role in his film to another actor and he made just a perfect choice in person of Clint Walker. This very huge actor (6'7"" high and build like a tank!) is best known for his role of Samson Posey in ""Dirty Dozen"" (remember the biggest guy, the one who didn't like to be pushed?) but in this film he displays an actorship on a wholly different level, as Captain Denis Bourke, the leader of the little group of stranded Americans. Sinatra took himself the role of a barely competent Navy Medic, whose fighting skills are nonexistent and who spends most of his time drunk or getting there...The story is quite interesting and well thought over. The vicious ""guerilla"" both sides wage for the limited resources of the island is full of dirty tricks and bloody episodes - and sometimes things go all the way to the knife fight... But there are also many quite funny moments, frequently involving one Japanese private, who was a Buddhist priest in civil life and now proudly defends his title of ""most incompetent soldier of Imperial Army"" (although he makes his duty the best he can). This is not however a comedy, far from it - and the war, the big war that still rages in the Pacific, is always present, just somewhere over the rainbow. The scene of amputation of a leg without anesthesia, with a bayonet and carpenter's saw is especially very tough.Sinatra took great care to keep the details right. The Japanese little troop is armed exactly as it should be - Arisaka rifles with long bayonets for all soldiers and one Nambu light machine gun to provide support, with the one officer carrying his sword and a Nambu automatic pistol. Americans are armed according to their apartenance: the Marines have Garand semi-automatic rifles or M1 semi-automatic carbines, with the sergeant carying the only M3 ""Grease Gun"" submachine gun; Captain Bourke and the radio operator, who both belong to USAAF, have only side arms (a revolver for Bourke and a M1911 Colt 0.45 automatic for the radio operator). Sinatra, who is a Navy medic, unlike on the cover of DVD is unarmed (and nobody dares to give him a weapon at any moment in the film, even when he is sober...)Geographical settings were also checked carefully and they are credible. We know therefore that the place of action is situated somewhere in Solomon Islands between Santa Isabel and Bougainville -and it is true that there is no shortage of small islands devoided of population in this area, even today... Also, I could not find many logical flaws in the scenario - both groups behave rationally and rather credibly.It is however important to precise, that during all Pacific War there was NEVER any incident even vaguely similar to what ""None but the brave"" describes. Also, the conclusion of the film, ""Nobody ever wins"", is in my modest opinion obviously false - in Pacific War there definitely was a winner and it is rather clear who it was...But bottom line, I liked this surprising film quite a lot and I am going to conserve this DVD preciously in my collection. And I think anybody interested in war, action or adventure films will probably like it too.

1145001,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00143XE0U,trebe,"[2, 3]","Set on an island in the south Pacific during World War II, None But The Brave is notable as the only film to be directed and produced by Frank Sinatra.  The movie revolves around the interactions between a group of Japanese soldiers stranded on the island, and American Marines who suddenly arrive, when their transport plane is shot down and crash lands on the island.The film is a collaborative effort between American and Japanese studios.  These filmmakers appear to have admirable intentions.  Instead of focusing on combat between the American and Japanese forces, the film attempts to provide some insight into the motivation, philosophy, and culture of the Japanese soldiers, primarily through the thoughts of their commanding officer, Lieutenant Kuroki (Tatsuya Mihashi), who provides narration at various points.  Painting the entire group with one broad brush may not be accurate, but the hope is that the Japanese soldiers will be viewed as fellow humans and not just the `enemy'.The Americans are led by Captain Dennis Bourke (Clint Walker), the pilot of the plane, and headstrong Marine Lieutenant Blair (Tommy Sands).  Initially, the opposing forces feel each other out, as the Marines try to gain access to fresh water, and steal a boat the Japanese have constructed.  Discovering that each is cutoff from communication with their respective commands, a truce is proposed by Kuroki who needs medical assistance for one of his men.  Pharmacist mate Maloney (Sinatra) is pressed into service as a surgeon, to amputate the gangrenous leg of a Japanese soldier.Following a successful operation, peaceful and mostly cooperative coexistence ensues, with the Americans trading cigarettes for fish, and Maloney providing basic care for the recovering soldier.  The truce appears broken when the Japanese discover that the Americans have repaired their radio, but an impending storm brings everyone together in a joint effort to save a well.  After the Americans restore radio communications, the Japanese refuse an offer to surrender, leading to a final battle for the island.  At the end of the film, the words ""Nobody Ever Wins"" appear on the screen.  The precise point of the film may be subject to discussion, but examining the tragic nature of war and conflict, might be near the top of the list.Moral statements aside, the film is entertaining, although not very realistic.  The fighting scenes are almost laughable, only slightly above something like McHale's Navy.  Soldiers on both sides just can't shoot straight.  If they could, there would soon be few alive, as most don't seem concerned about being shot.  Spreading out and taking cover when under fire, would seem obvious self preservation, yet it is rarely done.  Apparently these troops are unaware, that when someone is shooting at you, standing up or moving away from cover, makes you a better target.Artillery fire from a destroyer, that should blow craters on the beach, result in tiny unrealistic explosions.  When the truce almost ends, the two forces stand a few feet apart ready to rumble like street gangs.  It's dramatic, but not very realistic.  When the sky suddenly turns dark, somehow both Kuroki and Bourke immediately recognize that a huge storm is imminent, and that they must work together to protect the well.  Due to their quick efforts, a wall of tree trunks and a few sandbags, manages to hold back the flood waters.  Well I'll be a son of a buck!Discipline is lacking, when Marines ordered not to advance, still proceed to the water hole.  A sergeant (Brad Dexter) challenges the chain of command, taking a swing at Bourke.  Insubordination is present on both sides, with the Japanese making an unauthorized raid, and a gung ho Lieutenant Blair itching to engage the enemy.Serving as both director and producer, it is a fair assumption that Sinatra was on board with the aims of the film.  In the trailer for the film, Sinatra asks the audience the provocative question, ""can you still pull the trigger"" if the enemy is not some faceless stranger.  As an actor, Sinatra turns in a good performance, though mostly in the background, and absent during the fight scenes.  As a director, working with a script with issues, Sinatra demonstrates that he can handle a comic book type action film.Much of the location work was shot of the island of Kauai, in Hawaii.  While filming in the Aloha State, Brad Dexter saved Sinatra from drowning, leading to their friendship.  Dexter then played a prominent role in Sinatra's next film, the World War II adventure, Von Ryan's Express.  Also in the cast, is Sinatra's ex-son in law, Tommy Sands, the pop singer who was married to his daughter, Nancy Sinatra.While a collaborative effort, the film has a definite Hollywood look.  Much of the special effects and model plane work, reflects the trademark Japanese style, similar to a Godzilla film.  A young John Williams, provides a rousing score, with elements of Japanese music mixed in.  None But The Brave may not be the most polished effort, and it does not escape being clich&eacute;d and at times wooden, but the attempt to be more than another shoot `em up war flick is admirable.  Sinatra's lone directorial effort looks terrific in Warner Brothers Frank Sinatra Collection widescreen edition.",3,admirable intentions . . .,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,5284,"['Set', 'island',

Lots of bull talk some ridiculous.You have to play this in the hard of hearing sound mode to see the subtitles as to what the Japs say. Unfortunately these stay on when the Americans speak creating a distraction. All in all a mediocre picture at best.,2,Poor war flick--too much wasted foolish talk,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,392,"['Dont', 'expect', 'tons', 'action', 'war', 'minds', 'Jap', 'Officer', 'versus', 'American', 'officer', 'who', 'men', 'must', 'survive', 'same', 'island', 'Lots', 'bull', 'talk', 'ridiculous.You', 'have', 'play', 'hard', 'hearing', 'sound', 'mode', 'see', 'subtitles', 'what', 'Japs', 'say', 'Unfortunately', 'stay', 'when', 'Americans', 'speak', 'creating', 'distraction', 'mediocre', 'picture', 'best']",N/A
