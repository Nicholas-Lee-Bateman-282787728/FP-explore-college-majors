I'd not seen the original Darkman, so I had no preconceived notions of what the series was  like, I therefore enjoyed it more than a connoisseur of the genera might  have.  I did seen Darkman III first, however, and enjoyed it more; perhaps  because I enjoyed Jeff Fahey as a bad-guy more than I did Larry Drake.  They do say that the quality of the villain makes the film.  I also thought  Mr. Vosloo's Darkman was more brittle in II than in III.  Perhaps the  quality of the bad guy effected his performance too, or maybe he was just  getting used to his character and the series and was only  beginning to  develop his own particular point of view on both.  I tend to agree with the  reviewers who felt that the series would make a better subject for TV than  for Cinema.",3,Return of Durant,952819200,"03 12, 2000",2000,902,"['bought', 'title', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'was', 'leading', 'member', 'cast', ""'ve"", 'come', 'appreciate', 'characterizations', ""'d"", 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'Darkman', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', 'series', 'was', 'therefore', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'connoisseur', 'genera', 'might', 'have', 'did', 'seen', 'Darkman', 'III', 'first', 'however', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'perhaps', 'enjoyed', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'bad-guy', 'more', 'did', 'Larry', 'Drake', 'do', 'say', 'quality', 'villain', 'film', 'also', 'thought', 'Mr.', 'Vosloo', 'Darkman', 'was', 'more', 'brittle', 'II', 'III', 'Perhaps', 'quality', 'bad', 'guy', 'effected', 'performance', 'too', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'used', 'character', 'series', 'was', 'only', 'beginning', 'develop', 'own', 'particular', 'point', 'view', 'tend', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'felt', 'series', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'subject', 'TV', 'Cinema']",N/A

It doesn't equal the awesome flavor of the first, but it's fun, if not forgettable. The plot: arch-nemesis Durant is back. Somehow, he's survived the helicopter crash from the first and only has one scar on his face to prove it. This is acceptable because Durant was such a great villain and because they got Larry Drake to play him again. Arnold Vosloo (Hard Target, The Mummy) plays Darkman and isn't as bad as I expected. He's different from Liam Neeson, who played our hero in the first, but he's still good and acceptable in the role. There is a lot of really good action scenes and the story is pretty good, if not at times repetitive of the first.

63391,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,078323046X,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","It's been about 10 years since I saw Sam Raimi's original 'Darkman' but I decided to give this direct-to-video sequel a try for a number of reasons. First off it stars one of my favorite villains, Arnold Vosloo ('Hard Target' which was also produced by Raimi and Robert Tapert), second it also features the super sexy Kim Delaney ('NYPD Blue') and finally it was only a $1 brand new. As a movie it's pretty terrible due to its over-the-top and cartoonish nature. But as a comic book movie it's very entertaining. It tries very hard (and occasionally succeeds) to recapture the style and spirit of the original.Now that Peyton Westlake (Vosloo) has defeated his mortal enemy Durant (Larry Drake) he can focus all his energy into his life's work - creating a synthetic mask that will cover his horribly disfigured face. The only problem is that in all of his experiments he can never get the mask to last longer than 99 minutes. Peyton joins forces with a fellow scientist who's also working to create a synthetic mask. His experiments have been more successful since his mask can last for nearly 3 hours. Before these two can perfect the mask, the scientist is murdered by Durant who wants to inherit the scientist's giant warehouse and conduct his own experiments. (Even though Durant was killed in a helicopter explosion in the first film, he somehow managed to survive with only minor scars and debilitating migraines to show for it.) In an effort to corner the arms market, Durant has also joined forces with a scientist, only this one is working on an atomic laser gun which Durant plans to sell to rival dealers in the hopes that they'll wipe each other out with the new super-weapon. With both Westlake and Durant scrambling to complete their experiments it's only a matter of time before their paths cross and they realize the other one is still alive. After this inevitably happens, there's only one person Peyton can trust - an ambitious reporter named Rachel (Delaney).Like I said the film is totally campy and over-the-top but in a good way. These are precisely the elements you look for in a  good comic book movie. With the exception of some subpar special effects the film looks good. There's lots of dark alleyways, spooky thunder and lightning and loud explosions to jolt the senses. The action scenes, as low key as they are, rely on archive footage from the first film a bit too heavily. One of that film's best gags, Peyton creating a Durant mask to infiltrate his inner circle, is repeated here twice but with Durant's henchmen this time. The script makes up for any inconsistencies by supplying an endless amount of great one liners, most of them delivered by Drake. If there is such a thing as a best performance it would probably be him. He seems to genuinely be enjoying the chance to recreate the elegant and eccentric title character. Vosloo, in a rare leading role, does an okay job as Westlake. He doesn't fare as well as Darkman though constantly screaming ""Durant!"" at the top of his lungs and smashing his fists on whatever hard surface is in front of him for added dramatic effect. Delaney is given the least to do out of anyone. But she's super beautiful to look at. That seems to be the theme of the film - no matter how dumb things get or over-the-top they are, there's always something visually interesting to look at.",3,Durant Might Be Back But Nobody Else Is,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,3354,"['been', '10', 'years', 'saw', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'original', ""'Darkman"", 'decided', 'give', 'direct-to-video', 'sequel', 'try', 'number', 'reasons', 'First', 'one', 'favorite', 'villains', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', ""'Hard"", 'Target', 'was', 'also', 'produced', 'Raimi', 'Robert', 'Tapert', 'second', 'also', 'super', 'sexy', 'Kim', 'Delaney', ""'NYPD"", 'Blue', 'finally', 'was', 'only', '1', 'brand', 'new', 'movie', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'due', 'over-the-top', 'cartoonish', 'nature', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'very', 'hard', 'occasionally', 'recapture', 'style', 'spirit', 'original.Now', 'Peyton', 'Westlake', 'Vosloo', 'defeated', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'Durant', 'Larry', 'Drake', 'can', 'focus', 'energy', 'life', 'work', 'creating', 'synthetic', 'mask', 'will', 'cover', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'face', 'only', 'problem', 'experiments', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'mask', 'last', 'longer', '99', 'minutes', 'Peyton', 'forces', 'fellow', 'scientist', 'who', 'also', 'working', 'create', 'synthetic', 'mask', 'experiments', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'mask', 'can', 'last', 'nearly', '3', 'hours', 'two', 'can', 'perfect', 'mask', 'scientist', 'murdered', 'Durant', 'who', 'inherit', 'scientist', 'giant', 'warehouse', 'conduct', 'own', 'experiments', 'Even', 'Durant', 'was', 'killed', 'helicopter', 'explosion', 'first', 'film', 'somehow', 'managed', 'survive', 'only', 'minor', 'scars', 'debilitating', 'migraines', 'show', 'effort', 'corner', 'arms', 'market', 'Durant', 'also', 'joined', 'forces', 'scientist', 'only', 'one', 'working', 'atomic', 'laser', 'gun', 'Durant', 'sell', 'rival', 'dealers', 'hopes', ""'ll"", 'wipe', 'other', 'new', 'super-weapon', 'Westlake', 'Durant', 'scrambling', 'complete', 'experiments', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'paths', 'cross', 'realize', 'other', 'one', 'still', 'alive', 'inevitably', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'Peyton', 'can', 'trust', 'ambitious', 'reporter', 'named', 'Rachel', 'Delaney', '.Like', 'said', 'film', 'totally', 'campy', 'over-the-top', 'good', 'way', 'are', 'precisely', 'elements', 'look', 'good', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'exception', 'subpar', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'good', 'lots', 'dark', 'alleyways', 'spooky', 'thunder', 'lightning', 'loud', 'explosions', 'jolt', 'senses', 'action', 'scenes', 'low', 'key', 'are', 'rely', 'archive', 'footage', 'first', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'heavily', 'One', 'film', 'best', 'gags', 'Peyton', 'creating', 'Durant', 'mask', 'infiltrate', 'inner', 'circle', 'repeated', 'here', 'twice', 'Durant', 'henchmen', 'time', 'script', 'up', 'inconsistencies', 'supplying', 'endless', 'amount', 'great', 'one', 'liners', 'most', 'delivered', 'Drake', 'such', 'thing', 'best', 'performance', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'genuinely', 'be', 'enjoying', 'chance', 'recreate', 'elegant', 'eccentric', 'title', 'character', 'Vosloo', 'rare', 'leading', 'role', 'okay', 'job', 'Westlake', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'Darkman', 'constantly', 'screaming', 'Durant', 'top', 'lungs', 'smashing', 'fists', 'hard', 'surface', 'front', 'added', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'Delaney', 'given', 'least', 'do', 'anyone', 'super', 'beautiful', 'look', 'be', 'theme', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'dumb', 'things', 'get', 'over-the-top', 'are', 'always', 'something', 'visually', 'interesting', 'look']",N/A

It manages to capture the look and feel of the first film better than you'd expect.  Not 100% mind you, but the title sequence and the flashes of Darkman's rage and the music are duplicated perfectly.  This no doubt has to do with Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert being on board as executive producers.  It's the return of Durant(that's Robert G Durant to you), and he's no mere henchman this time around, but the big cheese.  It's a bit difficult to believe he actually survived that helicopter crash, and even more difficult to believe that if he did survive, that he wouldn't be covered with major third degree burns not unlike Darkman himself.  But this is a B action film, who the hell cares?  Did we question why Arcane just showed up in Return of the Swamp Thing all alive and healthy for no logical reason?  Of course not, you just accept it.  Durant's got a plan to corner the market on arms sales by creating one big whoopass gun, but he's having a few problems with some folks who won't sell their building so Durant can convert it to a manufacturing plant.  Add to that, Darkman problems.  Darkman has now become full fledged crimefighter(at least I think so.  In the beginning he puts the hurt on a guy who was shooting up a car full of people, but then switches his attention solely to Durant), and lives a kind of Batman existence underground.  He even has a mini railway car.  He's still having a hell of a time trying to get that synthetic skin to hold together though.  He finds hope in another scientist who's working on the same thing, but that's quickly down the tubes coz the scientist is the guy who won't sell Durant his building....and we all know what happens when folks don't cooperate with Durant, don't we?  So now Darkman's double pissed.  Again he tries to infiltrate Durant's organization through his clever disguises and it all leads to an explosive showdown as you would expect from this kind of film.  Though most of it's by the numbers, this movie is pretty good.  Don't be discouraged by the fact that Liam Neeson isn't here.  After all, he had more important things to do like star in that rotten Star Wars movie(Rob Roy was cool though!).  Arnold Vosloo isn't what you'd call a household name, but most folks might remember him as the guy who played the mummy in the films with Brendan Fraser.  Vosloo was actually picked by Raimi and Tapert as Neeson's replacement, and it's easy to see why.  I actually like Vosloo better as Darkman.  He's got charisma, charm.  Hell, the guy is smooth.  And when needed he can jump into action mode, no problem.  I like Liam Neeson, but he was a little too mumbly and whiney.  Vosloo is more of the badass you picture a guy like Darkman to be.  Of course a lot more screen time is given to Larry Drake.  Actually, I'd even go so far to say he's the star of the film.  Great job as always, he looks like he's having fun.  Of course he usually looks like he's having fun.  A very good performance, a very mean and over the top villain.
