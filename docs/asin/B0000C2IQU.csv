772806,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B0000C2IQU,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[3, 6]","The story starts out with a young man finding a wallet on the street while considering marriage to the lady he loves. He calls the only number he can find in the wallet that is the supposed to be the brother of the owner. But then he finds a lottery ticket in it and hears the numbers for the winning ticket. The ticket in the wallet. So what would you do if you found a wallet on the street and it had a lottery ticket worth six million dollars in it? Then his three friends join him for an evening of poker. When a man, played by James Earl Jones, rings the bell and says he is the owner of the wallet, the finder decides to swap the ticket for his losing ticket. The wallet recoverer is invited to play cards by his friends and the the police arrive searching the building and forbiding anyone to leave.The young man starts to panic wondering if the wallet owner knows he swapped tickets. Finally one of his friends realizes what he has done and takes action against the man that came to recover the wallet. An action that may lead to a life or death result. When a cop arrives at the scene he is given the lottery ticket to make sure the right thing is done. But then at the end we see another ticket given to the man recovering the wallet. The twists and turns in the story make it rather interesting and I enjoyed it. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""Millions (2005)"" and ""It Could Happen to You (1994)"". - C.

772807,A1MIJKZQ1MIRBM,B0000C2IQU,C. Law,"[7, 17]","In FIGHT CLUB, Brad Pitt's character asks the character played by Edward Norton if he could fight anyone who would it be. My answer to that question would have to be SURVIVOR host Jeff Probst (or perhaps Dr. Phil). Don't ask me why? Probst just really gets on my nerves on that show. So much so that after somewhat enjoying the show's first season I quit watching after that just because of its host. So, when I first heard of FINDER'S FEE I became outraged that just because the guy was the host of a popular reality show that he would be given the chance to write and direct his own film. Naturally, when I saw the film on the shelf of my local video store I had to rent it. I wanted to hate it. I couldn't wait to hate it and tear it apart piece by piece. Did I hate it? No, I'm sorry to say that I didn't. However, I didn't love it either. At least I can find some comfort in that.First off, the film has an interesting concept. If you found a winning lottery ticket in a stranger's wallet would you give it back? I'd like to think that I would but who knows? That would probably be a hard thing to do. And who knows more about the crazy things people will do for money than writer/director Jeff Probst? I mean, the man sees people competing for money on a daily basis so he knows a thing or two about the plot from first hand experiences.Anyway, for the first hour and twenty minutes or so the film seems to be moving a long rather nicely until suddenly a certain character does something that seems very out of character by smashing a certain someone in the head with a champagne bottle. I was baffled. This, to me, just felt like it came completely out of left field. While the action does lead to some of the film's more exciting moments that's just not where I saw the film heading from the way the first acts played out. Normally, I would be happy to be surprised by the final act but this surprise just seemed to out there no matter who the director of the film was.All in all, FINDER'S FEE is an enjoyable little movie that is extremely hurt by it's final twenty minutes and Jeff Probst proves he may have some talent behind the lens but that doesn't mean I have to like him.The film stars Matthew Lillaird (SCREAM, SCOOBY DOO), Eric Palladino (U-571), Dash Mihok (BASIC, WHITEBOYS), Ryan Reynolds (VAN WILDER, THE IN-LAWS), James Earl Jones (PATRIOT GAMES, CONAN THE BARBARIAN), and Robert Forster (JACKIE BROWN, VIGILANTE)C-",3,Enjoyable but extremely hurt by its final act!,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,2438,"['FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'character', 'played', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'could', 'fight', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'answer', 'question', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'SURVIVOR', 'host', 'Jeff', 'Probst', 'perhaps', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'Probst', 'just', 'really', 'nerves', 'show', 'So', 'much', 'somewhat', 'enjoying', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'quit', 'watching', 'just', 'host', 'So', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'FINDER', 'FEE', 'became', 'outraged', 'just', 'guy', 'was', 'host', 'popular', 'reality', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'write', 'direct', 'own', 'film', 'Naturally', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'shelf', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'had', 'rent', 'wanted', 'hate', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'hate', 'tear', 'apart', 'piece', 'piece', 'Did', 'hate', 'No', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'either', 'least', 'can', 'find', 'comfort', 'that.First', 'film', 'interesting', 'concept', 'found', 'winning', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'stranger', 'wallet', 'would', 'give', 'back', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'would', 'who', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'hard', 'thing', 'do', 'who', 'more', 'crazy', 'things', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'money', 'writer/director', 'Jeff', 'Probst', 'mean', 'man', 'people', 'competing', 'money', 'daily', 'basis', 'so', 'thing', 'two', 'plot', 'first', 'hand', 'experiences.Anyway', 'first', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'be', 'moving', 'long', 'rather', 'nicely', 'suddenly', 'certain', 'character', 'something', 'very', 'character', 'smashing', 'certain', 'someone', 'head', 'champagne', 'bottle', 'was', 'baffled', 'just', 'felt', 'came', 'completely', 'left', 'field', 'action', 'lead', 'film', 'more', 'exciting', 'moments', 'just', 'not', 'where', 'saw', 'film', 'heading', 'way', 'first', 'acts', 'played', 'out', 'Normally', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'be', 'surprised', 'final', 'act', 'surprise', 'just', 'seemed', 'there', 'matter', 'who', 'director', 'film', 'was.All', 'FINDER', 'FEE', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'movie', 'extremely', 'hurt', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Jeff', 'Probst', 'may', 'have', 'talent', 'lens', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'like', 'him.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Matthew', 'Lillaird', 'SCREAM', 'SCOOBY', 'DOO', 'Eric', 'Palladino', 'U-571', 'Dash', 'Mihok', 'BASIC', 'WHITEBOYS', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'VAN', 'WILDER', 'THE', 'IN-LAWS', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'CONAN', 'THE', 'BARBARIAN', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'JACKIE', 'BROWN', 'VIGILANTE', 'C-']",N/A

JEFF PROBST of survivor fame debuts with this incredibly engaging film. Written and directed by the rising star, this film leaves u wishing he would come with another film soon. His directing decisions show threw out as he crafts one of the best films I have ever seen. I can't believe this film didn't blow up, but at least he won best up and coming director for this film or was it best new director.The story follows Tepper {Erik Palladino} as he is preparing to propose to his girl, and on his way home he finds a lost wallet and calls a number inside looking for the owner. He soon finds out that the lottery ticket inside is the winning ticket, and decides to keep it. Soon following this his friends drop in to get started on playing cards, and that's when the real entertainment begins. Has all three arrive to play the owner shows up,  James Earl Jones. As he gives the wallet back the police storm the building and put it on lock down. So the stakes rise and friendships get tested as the lottery tickets are up for grabs in the game including the winning ticket. The best part happens when Mr. Jones is attacked by one of them because he figured out what was going on with the ticket.The thing that makes this film so great is the acting, each actor brings their character to life with their performances. The best performances come from Ryan Reynolds, Matthew Lillard, and Dash Mihok. Reynolds in his quiet shy role surprises the film the most with his violent out burst in the end showing that his depression goes beyond just taking Fishmans abuse. Speaking of Fishman, this role is played brilliantly by Lillard. It is great to see him in this role demanding respect, as he is a small skinny dude bossing the others around. Of course one of the best ones is played by Mihok in his role as a guy who needs to give advice, and desperately wants kids. Each one of these characters each have problems and need the 6 million, so the game is on.Also get the dvd if u are interested in becoming a filmmaker, because the commentary gives one of the best incites into the business I have ever heard.So in completion I really really recommend this film to everybody.",5,GREAT FILM,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,2267,"['FINDER', 'FEEABSOULUT', 'CLASSICWhat', 'can', 'say', 'instant', 'classic', 'dawm', 'what', 'debut', 'JEFF', 'PROBST', 'survivor', 'fame', 'incredibly', 'engaging', 'film', 'Written', 'directed', 'rising', 'star', 'film', 'u', 'wishing', 'would', 'come', 'film', 'soon', 'directing', 'decisions', 'show', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'up', 'least', 'won', 'best', 'up', 'coming', 'director', 'film', 'was', 'best', 'new', 'director.The', 'story', 'Tepper', 'Erik', 'Palladino', 'preparing', 'propose', 'girl', 'way', 'home', 'lost', 'wallet', 'number', 'looking', 'owner', 'soon', 'out', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'inside', 'winning', 'ticket', 'keep', 'Soon', 'following', 'drop', 'get', 'started', 'playing', 'cards', 'when', 'real', 'entertainment', 'begins', 'Has', 'three', 'arrive', 'play', 'owner', 'up', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'wallet', 'back', 'police', 'storm', 'building', 'put', 'lock', 'down', 'stakes', 'rise', 'friendships', 'get', 'tested', 'lottery', 'tickets', 'are', 'up', 'grabs', 'game', 'including', 'winning', 'ticket', 'best', 'part', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'attacked', 'one', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'ticket.The', 'thing', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'acting', 'actor', 'character', 'life', 'performances', 'best', 'performances', 'come', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Dash', 'Mihok', 'Reynolds', 'quiet', 'shy', 'role', 'film', 'most', 'violent', 'out', 'burst', 'end', 'showing', 'depression', 'just', 'taking', 'Fishmans', 'abuse', 'Speaking', 'Fishman', 'role', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Lillard', 'great', 'see', 'role', 'demanding', 'respect', 'small', 'skinny', 'dude', 'bossing', 'others', 'course', 'one', 'best', 'ones', 'played', 'Mihok', 'role', 'guy', 'who', 'give', 'advice', 'desperately', 'kids', 'one', 'characters', 'have', 'problems', 'need', '6', 'million', 'so', 'game', 'on.Also', 'get', 'dvd', 'u', 'are', 'interested', 'becoming', 'filmmaker', 'commentary', 'one', 'best', 'incites', 'business', 'have', 'ever', 'heard.So', 'completion', 'really', 'really', 'recommend', 'film', 'everybody']",N/A

This is a very challenging story to write as it all takes place in an apartment with five guys playing poker.Now to keep me entertained for 99 minutes with just one setting is a pretty damn hard to do, but it worked.Summary is Tep (Eric Palladino-U-571) invites his three buddies, Mathew Lillard (Scream), Dash Mihok (White Boys), and Ryan Reynolds (Van-Wilder/Buying The Cow) over the for there usual night of poker.  Earlier the night Tep finds a wallett out on the street.  He picks it up and calls the owner.  Tep is also into winning the lottery, and during their poker game all the buddies put up their Lotto tickets in a game of &quot;Last Man Standing.&quot; Rules are you are  not look at the numbers before the game.  Tep does and finds out his ticket is not a winner. Tep calls a number in the wallet, leaving a message to tell the owner of the wallet &quot;Avery Phillips&quot; (James Earl Jones), that he has his ticket and Tep gives his address to come over and pick up the wallet.  In Avery Phillips wallet is a lotto ticket with you guessed the WINNING NUMBERS.  I will not tell you anymore cause I want you to feel the intensity of the entire movie that never lets up once Mr. Phillips enters the room to pick up his wallet.  Some great twits and turns that you will not see coming.Jeff Probst might be a dork of host on Survivor, but the guy is a stud when writting and directing.  Here's to you Probst.
