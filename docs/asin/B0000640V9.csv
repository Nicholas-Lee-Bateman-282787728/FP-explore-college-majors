697613,A1OH145PO8YKDM,B0000640V9,"Anton Batey ""Anton_Batey@yahoo.com""","[8, 9]","The premise of the film revolves around two young, average everyday Germans, and not Adolf Hitler himself, which makes the film even better.  So if you're tired of watching the documentaries and reading the biographies regarding Hitler's personal life, and want to get an understanding of how the Nazi fascist movement transformed history, watch this movie; absolutely, without a doubt.Karl Hoffman is an out of work mechanic who is in the SA, under the leadership of Ernst Rohm, who represents the left-wing of the Nazi Party, wanting to implement more socialist elements in Germany when the Nazis wont power.  Karl's brother, Helmut, is in the University to become an Asst. Professor, ""helping people look for jobs that don't exist"", referring to the 6 million unemployed Germans.Helmut meets Reinhard Heydrich, assistant to Heinrich Himmler, chief of Hitler's SS (top Nazi security and intelligence apparatus).  Heydrich picks up on Helmut's intelligence and quickly offers him a job with the SS, making more money than he would at the University.  Despite Helmut's belief that the Nazi philosophy is ""primitive rubbish"", he joins.Heydrich points out that Hitler will get in power utilizing the finance of the German capitalist class, such as the Krupps, Kirkdorffs, the Theisens, IG Farben, among others.  Mentioning this is what is paramount; the aspect that Nazi Germany ""historians"" fail to mention.  Hermann Goring, before the Nazi's were in power, was holding a ceremony, playing host to a number of Germany's capitalists, where he promised ""100 years of labor peace"".  Since the end of World War 1, German workers started to become ""self aware"", and demanded better hours (they won the 8-hour day in 1919), better wages and other concessions.  In the 1920s, Germany was actually called ""Red"" Germany because they were on the brink of becoming the world's first industrial socialist state.  It was Hitler's job to stop this from happening.  As Reinhard Heydrich said to Helmut, Hitler would get the rich ""plenty of profits, obedient workers"", and the COMPLETE abolition of trade unions, socialist or not.Hitler, Goebbels, Goring and Himmler called themselves ""National Socialists"" in order to hoodwink the German people into thinking the Nazi Party had the interests of the German worker at heart.  Some top Nazi members even took the word ""socialist"" in ""National Socialist"" serious.  Among them, Ernst Rohm, leader of the SA, Gregor Strasser, former number two man in the Party, General von Schleicher, along with about 150 others.  These men were running an ""army"" of the SA which was bigger than the German Army.  The leadership was arrested by Hitler himself (and 200 others) on June 30th, 1934.  This was the Night of the Long Knives.Karl Hoffman is arrested because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time when the SA leadership was arrested, but due to his brother's inside connections with the SS, he has Heydrich get him out.  In 1938, Helmut and Heydrich discuss the deceptive plan to take Poland.  150 SS officers dressed in Polish Army uniforms will ""attack"" a Germany radio, so Germany will be justified in annexing Poland.  In June, 1942, Heydrich is assassinated by two Czech patriots trained by the British.  In response, according to Gestapo records, 1,131 were killed.  This was in Lidice, Czechoslovakia, on June 10th, 1942.In conclusion with this review, I have seen probably every movie taking place in Hitler's Germany, and this is my favorite.  It exposes the truth about Hitler's connections with the owners of production in Germany, as well as other international bankers in England and the United States, and other international companies that made the Nazi's what they were: the protectors of the status quo.  Fascism is when mercantilism (which some call ""capitalism"" within a statist framework, or ""corporatism"") has to be maintained through the barrel of a gun; through absolute dictatorship.  It happened in Italy in the 20s, Germany and Spain in the 30s, El Salvador in the 70s, and can happen again.  It is corporatism at its worse.Anton Batey[...]",5,Best movie about the rise and fall of the Nazi Party,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,4095,"['premise', 'film', 'around', 'two', 'young', 'average', 'everyday', 'Germans', 'not', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'So', ""'re"", 'tired', 'watching', 'documentaries', 'reading', 'biographies', 'regarding', 'Hitler', 'personal', 'life', 'want', 'get', 'understanding', 'how', 'Nazi', 'fascist', 'movement', 'transformed', 'history', 'watch', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'doubt.Karl', 'Hoffman', 'work', 'mechanic', 'who', 'SA', 'leadership', 'Ernst', 'Rohm', 'who', 'left-wing', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'wanting', 'implement', 'more', 'socialist', 'elements', 'Germany', 'when', 'Nazis', 'wont', 'power', 'Karl', 'brother', 'Helmut', 'University', 'become', 'Asst', 'Professor', 'helping', 'people', 'look', 'jobs', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'referring', '6', 'million', 'unemployed', 'Germans.Helmut', 'meets', 'Reinhard', 'Heydrich', 'assistant', 'Heinrich', 'Himmler', 'chief', 'Hitler', 'SS', 'top', 'Nazi', 'security', 'intelligence', 'apparatus', 'up', 'Helmut', 'intelligence', 'quickly', 'job', 'SS', 'making', 'more', 'money', 'would', 'University', 'Helmut', 'belief', 'Nazi', 'philosophy', 'primitive', 'rubbish', 'points', 'out', 'Hitler', 'will', 'get', 'power', 'utilizing', 'finance', 'German', 'capitalist', 'class', 'such', 'Krupps', 'Kirkdorffs', 'Theisens', 'IG', 'Farben', 'others', 'Mentioning', 'what', 'paramount', 'aspect', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'historians', 'fail', 'mention', 'Hermann', 'Goring', 'Nazi', 'were', 'power', 'was', 'holding', 'ceremony', 'playing', 'host', 'number', 'Germany', 'capitalists', 'where', 'promised', '100', 'years', 'labor', 'peace', 'end', 'World', 'War', '1', 'German', 'workers', 'started', 'become', 'aware', 'demanded', 'better', 'hours', 'won', '8-hour', 'day', '1919', 'better', 'wages', 'other', 'concessions', '1920s', 'Germany', 'was', 'actually', 'called', 'Red', 'Germany', 'were', 'brink', 'becoming', 'world', 'first', 'industrial', 'socialist', 'state', 'was', 'Hitler', 'job', 'stop', 'happening', 'Reinhard', 'Heydrich', 'said', 'Helmut', 'Hitler', 'would', 'get', 'rich', 'plenty', 'profits', 'obedient', 'workers', 'COMPLETE', 'abolition', 'trade', 'unions', 'socialist', 'not.Hitler', 'Goebbels', 'Goring', 'Himmler', 'called', 'National', 'Socialists', 'order', 'hoodwink', 'German', 'people', 'thinking', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'had', 'interests', 'German', 'worker', 'heart', 'top', 'Nazi', 'members', 'even', 'took', 'word', 'socialist', 'National', 'Socialist', 'serious', 'Ernst', 'Rohm', 'leader', 'SA', 'Gregor', 'Strasser', 'former', 'number', 'two', 'man', 'Party', 'General', 'von', 'Schleicher', '150', 'others', 'men', 'were', 'running', 'army', 'SA', 'was', 'bigger', 'German', 'Army', 'leadership', 'was', 'arrested', 'Hitler', '200', 'others', 'June', '30th', '1934', 'was', 'Night', 'Long', 'Knives.Karl', 'Hoffman', 'arrested', 'was', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'when', 'SA', 'leadership', 'was', 'arrested', 'due', 'brother', 'inside', 'connections', 'SS', 'Heydrich', 'get', 'out', '1938', 'Helmut', 'Heydrich', 'discuss', 'deceptive', 'plan', 'take', 'Poland', '150', 'SS', 'officers', 'dressed', 'Polish', 'Army', 'uniforms', 'will', 'attack', 'Germany', 'radio', 'so', 'Germany', 'will', 'be', 'justified', 'annexing', 'Poland', 'June', '1942', 'Heydrich', 'assassinated', 'two', 'Czech', 'patriots', 'trained', 'British', 'response', 'according', 'Gestapo', 'records', '1,131', 'were', 'killed', 'was', 'Lidice', 'Czechoslovakia', 'June', '10th', '1942.In', 'conclusion', 'review', 'have', 'seen', 'probably', 'movie', 'taking', 'place', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'favorite', 'truth', 'Hitler', 'connections', 'owners', 'production', 'Germany', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'international', 'bankers', 'England', 'United', 'States', 'other', 'international', 'companies', 'made', 'Nazi', 'what', 'were', 'protectors', 'status', 'quo', 'Fascism', 'when', 'mercantilism', 'call', 'capitalism', 'statist', 'framework', 'corporatism', 'be', 'maintained', 'barrel', 'gun', 'absolute', 'dictatorship', 'happened', 'Italy', '20s', 'Germany', 'Spain', '30s', 'El', 'Salvador', '70s', 'can', 'happen', 'again', 'corporatism', 'worse.Anton', 'Batey', '[', ']']",Hitler's SS: Portrait in Evil
697614,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0000640V9,Anyechka,"[4, 4]","This was always one of my favorite movies that the History Channel used to show back when they had Movies in Time, and I was so happy recently to find out that it had been issued on DVD instead of going out of print like a number of their other great Movies in Time have.  It's a very gripping (and quite long) historical drama concerning the lives and fates of two brothers, Helmut and Karl Hoffmann, in Nazi Germany.  It actually begins before the Nazis have come to power, although their ideology is becoming more and more popular.  Initially it's Karl who is more interested in joining their ranks (but through the SA, not the SS), while Helmut is more hesitant.  However, before long, based on abuses of power he's witnessed, Karl jumps ship, which lands him in a lot of hot water with the authorities, particularly as the Nazis gain more and more power.  He even gets sent to Dachau for going to the police and trying to reopen a case they officially closed years ago, wherein his friend Rudolf died of a back injury that was sustained some years before when members of the SA pushed him down the stairs as they were coercing Karl and Rudolf's labor union into disbanding.  Helmut meanwhile has joined the SS, and become very respected in his position.  He tries to warn Karl against the dangerous path he's heading down, but Karl believes in listening to his conscience, no matter the price.  Karl is later released from Dachau and sent into the Army, where he once again causes trouble with his anti-Nazi views.  This time he is in more trouble than he ever was before, and deserts, spending most of the rest of the war on the run and hiding with a woman named Mitzi, whom both of the brothers have had a relationship with.  Now more than ever the brothers are on a collision course against one another.There are so many issues and events covered in the course of this movie, it's like a crash course in German history during WWII.  It also shows ordinary people for the most part, although there are historical personages portrayed as well.  We see what it was actually like for regular people, why so many seemingly normal decent people went along with the Nazis, that evil isn't always so cut and dried.  We get insight into why more people didn't speak out like Karl, and why someone like Helmut didn't do more with his position to help people, apart from doing things like warning their old friend Professor Rosenberg to leave Germany while he still can, and later on trying to convince him he's exempt from deportation and should go home if he knows what's good for him.  Professor Rosenberg's character also illustrates why more Jews didn't leave Germany while they had the chance.  He was getting on in years, felt he was too old to learn another language, loved Germany, felt he would never feel at home in America or England, had good reason to feel that most American colleges wouldn't have much use for a professor of German literature, and just felt like he belonged there, that it would be wrong to leave his people and his nation, even knowing what deportation/relocation meant and that Helmut was trying to help him by trying to write him an excuse saying he was too ill to go on the transport.  We also see the tragedy of the youngest generation in the character of Hans, the third Hoffmann brother, whom we see getting baptised at the beginning of the movie.  He was brought up with the Nazis in power and doesn't know anything different, and is so brainwashed he reports for duty along with countless other young boys at the end of the war, by which time the Army was desperate for new soldiers, no matter their age.  Hans reacts with anger when Helmut finds him and urges him to get away, that that's no place for a child that young, particularly since this young boy is his baby brother.  So we really see the German experience during these years through many different perspectives.The only minor complaint I have about this movie is that all of the actors have British accents.  In and of itself, that's not such a big deal, but it does sort of take away some of the suspension of disbelief.  They could at least have tried to sound more German, the way the actors in my all-time favorite movie, 'The Inner Circle,' really sound like they have Russian accents.  I'm surprised to hear that some people received a DVD that only has half of the movie on it.  I'm wondering if perhaps that particular edition issued the film on a double-sided DVD but didn't advertise it as such.",5,Underrated historical drama,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,4506,"['was', 'always', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'History', 'Channel', 'used', 'show', 'back', 'when', 'had', 'Movies', 'Time', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'recently', 'find', 'out', 'had', 'been', 'issued', 'DVD', 'instead', 'going', 'print', 'number', 'other', 'great', 'Movies', 'Time', 'have', 'very', 'gripping', 'quite', 'long', 'historical', 'drama', 'concerning', 'lives', 'fates', 'two', 'brothers', 'Helmut', 'Karl', 'Hoffmann', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'actually', 'Nazis', 'have', 'come', 'power', 'ideology', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'popular', 'Initially', 'Karl', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'joining', 'ranks', 'SA', 'not', 'SS', 'Helmut', 'more', 'hesitant', 'However', 'long', 'based', 'abuses', 'power', 'witnessed', 'Karl', 'ship', 'lot', 'hot', 'water', 'authorities', 'particularly', 'Nazis', 'gain', 'more', 'more', 'power', 'even', 'sent', 'Dachau', 'going', 'police', 'trying', 'reopen', 'case', 'officially', 'closed', 'years', 'ago', 'wherein', 'friend', 'Rudolf', 'died', 'back', 'injury', 'was', 'sustained', 'years', 'when', 'members', 'SA', 'pushed', 'down', 'stairs', 'were', 'coercing', 'Karl', 'Rudolf', 'labor', 'union', 'disbanding', 'Helmut', 'meanwhile', 'joined', 'SS', 'become', 'very', 'respected', 'position', 'warn', 'Karl', 'dangerous', 'path', 'heading', 'down', 'Karl', 'listening', 'conscience', 'matter', 'price', 'Karl', 'later', 'released', 'Dachau', 'sent', 'Army', 'where', 'once', 'again', 'trouble', 'anti-Nazi', 'views', 'time', 'more', 'trouble', 'ever', 'was', 'deserts', 'spending', 'most', 'rest', 'war', 'run', 'hiding', 'woman', 'named', 'Mitzi', 'whom', 'brothers', 'have', 'had', 'relationship', 'Now', 'more', 'ever', 'brothers', 'are', 'collision', 'course', 'one', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'events', 'covered', 'course', 'movie', 'crash', 'course', 'German', 'history', 'WWII', 'also', 'ordinary', 'people', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'historical', 'personages', 'portrayed', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'regular', 'people', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'decent', 'people', 'went', 'Nazis', 'evil', ""n't"", 'always', 'so', 'cut', 'dried', 'get', 'insight', 'why', 'more', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'out', 'Karl', 'why', 'someone', 'Helmut', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'position', 'help', 'people', 'apart', 'doing', 'things', 'warning', 'old', 'friend', 'Professor', 'Rosenberg', 'leave', 'Germany', 'still', 'can', 'later', 'trying', 'convince', 'exempt', 'deportation', 'should', 'go', 'home', 'what', 'good', 'Professor', 'Rosenberg', 'character', 'also', 'why', 'more', 'Jews', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Germany', 'had', 'chance', 'was', 'getting', 'years', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'learn', 'language', 'loved', 'Germany', 'felt', 'would', 'never', 'feel', 'home', 'America', 'England', 'had', 'good', 'reason', 'feel', 'most', 'American', 'colleges', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'use', 'professor', 'German', 'literature', 'just', 'felt', 'belonged', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'leave', 'people', 'nation', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'deportation/relocation', 'meant', 'Helmut', 'was', 'trying', 'help', 'trying', 'write', 'excuse', 'saying', 'was', 'too', 'ill', 'go', 'transport', 'also', 'see', 'tragedy', 'youngest', 'generation', 'character', 'Hans', 'third', 'Hoffmann', 'brother', 'whom', 'see', 'getting', 'baptised', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'Nazis', 'power', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'different', 'so', 'brainwashed', 'duty', 'countless', 'other', 'young', 'boys', 'end', 'war', 'time', 'Army', 'was', 'desperate', 'new', 'soldiers', 'matter', 'age', 'reacts', 'anger', 'when', 'Helmut', 'get', 'away', 'place', 'child', 'young', 'particularly', 'young', 'boy', 'baby', 'brother', 'really', 'see', 'German', 'experience', 'years', 'many', 'different', 'perspectives.The', 'only', 'minor', 'complaint', 'have', 'movie', 'actors', 'have', 'British', 'accents', 'not', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'sort', 'take', 'away', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'could', 'least', 'have', 'tried', 'sound', 'more', 'German', 'way', 'actors', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movie', 'Inner', 'Circle', 'really', 'sound', 'have', 'Russian', 'accents', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'hear', 'people', 'received', 'DVD', 'only', 'half', 'movie', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'perhaps', 'particular', 'edition', 'issued', 'film', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'advertise', 'such']",Hitler's SS: Portrait in Evil

It is the full length movie, stating 150 minutes on the back of the clam shell.  Buying it several years ago in Columbus, Ohio, I guess I just got lucky from what some reviews indicate.I found this DVD drama to be a made for TV venture with a somewhat low budget feel to it, however, the photography and audio are both very good, as is true with story also.  As I stated first off, it is great entertainment but less great history.......not that it doesn't try to offer a true picture of what occurred between 1933 and 1945 in the Third Reich, but with only 150 minutes much of the war needed to be left out.  This is good viewing, but superficial history due to the omissions.Should a viewer be interested in a drama on the war from the German perspective, especially the Death Head SS, this film is well worth watching.  If a viewer is seeking a fuller in depth view of the war this is not the DVD for it.I give the DVD 4-stars plus, and enjoyed the film.  However, my book shelves are sagging from the weight of books on WWII so I could, as many others, fill in the gaps which are prevalent in this TV drama, this is not a documentary.The performances of both Tony Randall and Jose Ferrer must be mentioned as being terrific, two elements making this film unique.Semper Fi.",4,GREAT ENTERTAINMENT......LESS SO GREAT HISTORY,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,1350,"['clam', 'shell', 'cover', 'shown', 'here', 'identical', 'DVD', 'collection', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'stating', '150', 'minutes', 'back', 'clam', 'shell', 'Buying', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Columbus', 'Ohio', 'guess', 'just', 'got', 'lucky', 'what', 'reviews', 'indicate.I', 'found', 'DVD', 'drama', 'be', 'made', 'TV', 'venture', 'somewhat', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'however', 'photography', 'audio', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'true', 'story', 'also', 'stated', 'first', 'off', 'great', 'entertainment', 'less', 'great', 'history', ""n't"", 'try', 'offer', 'true', 'picture', 'what', 'occurred', '1933', '1945', 'Third', 'Reich', 'only', '150', 'minutes', 'much', 'war', 'needed', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'good', 'viewing', 'superficial', 'history', 'due', 'omissions.Should', 'viewer', 'be', 'interested', 'drama', 'war', 'German', 'perspective', 'especially', 'Death', 'Head', 'SS', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'viewer', 'seeking', 'fuller', 'depth', 'view', 'war', 'not', 'DVD', 'it.I', 'give', 'DVD', '4-stars', 'plus', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'However', 'book', 'shelves', 'are', 'sagging', 'weight', 'books', 'WWII', 'could', 'many', 'others', 'fill', 'gaps', 'are', 'prevalent', 'TV', 'drama', 'not', 'documentary.The', 'performances', 'Tony', 'Randall', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'being', 'terrific', 'two', 'elements', 'making', 'film', 'unique.Semper', 'Fi']",Hitler's SS: Portrait in Evil

G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[7, 7]","If you're old enough to remember the days of 3-channel TV (well, 5 if you included your one local channel and PBS) then you also remember when TV movies were a big deal. I still remember when this one came out, and it was interesting to watch it again after exactly 20 years. It was actually even better than I remember.""Hitler's SS: Portrait in Evil"" chronicles the experiences of two brothers, Karl and Helmut Hoffmann, during the rise, tenure, and collapse of the Nazi regime in Germany. The brothers are both intelligent and fundamentally decent people, protoges of a Jewish professor named Rosenberg (the great Jose Ferrer), but quickly gravitate to the dynamic Nazi Party during the early 1930s. Karl (John Shea) is a headstrong idealist who joins the storm troops; the shrewd and cynical Helmut (Bill Nighy) eventually opts for the SS. Karl is assigned to the staff of SA General Josef Biegler (Paul Brooke), while Helmut ends up working for the head of SS intelligence, Reinhard Heydrich (wonderful David Warner, showing the full range of his villainy).When internal tensions lead to violence between the SS and SA, Karl ends up in Dachau, watching his former comrades get shot by firing squads. Helmut manages to get him released, but from that point on Karl is a bitter enemy of the regime and especially of the SS, in which Helmut is fast rising. Nevertheless, the brothers stick by each other, and Helmut manages to get Karl into the army before his hotheaded antics get him thrown back in Dachau.The Hoffmans share a lover, a nightclub singer named Mitzi Templer (Lucy Gutteridge, who also appeared with Warner in the excellent George C. Scott version of ""A Christmas Carol""). Templer works for a politically incorrect comedian named Putzi (played by none other than Tony Randall), who is part of the anti-Hitler resistance. Together they tour the front, where they meet up with Karl, who is growing ever more hostile to the regime and now plans to desert. Meanwhile, Helmut finds himself sucked deeper and deeper into the murderous schemes of his superiors, even as the tide of the war swings irrevocably against Germany.""Hitler's SS"" is loaded with history, and gives a surprisingly accurate portrait of life in the Hitler state, as well as the relationship between the SA and SS. The actors who play Himmler (John Normington) and Rohm (Michael Elphick) look almost exactly like the real men in question, and the scene where Hitler (Colon Jeavons) and his henchmen roust out Rohm and the SA leadership from bed at gunpoint, only to find most of them shacking up with young boys, is extremely well done(whether it actually happened or not is another matter).The acting in this film is generally very good, which is no suprise considering the cast. I found Bill Nighy's performance to be superb (he was just in a play in D.C., as it happens). It would have been easy to play Helmut as a cynical weakling, and in fact that is what Helmut is, but Nighy manages to layer the character with decency and conflict (in one scene he buys back books confiscated from the dispossessed Rosenberg and then returns them to the professor) as well as opportunism and moral cowardice. The writers deserve credit for not succumbing to the tendency to make everyone in the black uniform a heel-clicking abomination.There is ""Hitler's SS"" in a nutshell.

At first each brother views the Nazis as just another political party. One brother becomes a full-time SS officer working for Heydrich, the other (who actually became a Nazi before his brother did) sees the evil of the Nazis sooner, and suffers for his outspokeness. The strength of the movie is its portrayal of ordinary Germans during this time period, and how they become caught up in the ugliness of the Nazi regime.The acting is so-so, but not bad if your expectations are not high.
