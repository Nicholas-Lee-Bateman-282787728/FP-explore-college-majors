They have been done for years and, when done right, serve as an intriguing canvas with which a director can paint a masterpiece.  `The French Lieutenants Woman' is not a masterpiece, but it is a very good film that utilizes this gimmick in a very interesting and effective way.The film tells the interwoven love stories of two actors and the characters they are portraying in a film.  The actors, Mike and Anna, are secretly having an affair with each other, while their characters, Charles and Sarah, are also having an affair.  These two stories take place in different worlds.  Anna and Mike live in their contemporary present (the 80's), while Charles and Sarah are dwelling in 19th century England.  Their storylines, while similar in many ways are also shaded with their own vital personality, making these parallel love stories feel fresh and exciting.Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep sell these couples marvelously, and the beautiful cinematography helps set a mood and maintain it.  As the lens captures the lushness of the countryside or manipulate the stuffiness of the characters' lives and need for freedom, we are drawn to their story and compelled to watch and listen intently.",4,A story told two ways...,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,1248,"['Interwoven', 'storylines', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'special', 'anymore', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'years', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'serve', 'intriguing', 'canvas', 'director', 'can', 'paint', 'masterpiece', 'French', 'Lieutenants', 'Woman', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'gimmick', 'very', 'interesting', 'effective', 'way.The', 'film', 'interwoven', 'love', 'stories', 'two', 'actors', 'characters', 'are', 'portraying', 'film', 'actors', 'Mike', 'Anna', 'are', 'secretly', 'having', 'affair', 'other', 'characters', 'Charles', 'Sarah', 'are', 'also', 'having', 'affair', 'two', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'different', 'worlds', 'Anna', 'Mike', 'live', 'contemporary', 'present', '80', 'Charles', 'Sarah', 'are', 'dwelling', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'Their', 'storylines', 'similar', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'also', 'shaded', 'own', 'vital', 'personality', 'making', 'parallel', 'love', 'stories', 'feel', 'fresh', 'exciting.Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'sell', 'couples', 'marvelously', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'set', 'mood', 'maintain', 'lens', 'lushness', 'countryside', 'manipulate', 'stuffiness', 'characters', 'lives', 'need', 'freedom', 'are', 'drawn', 'story', 'compelled', 'watch', 'listen', 'intently']",N/A

Streep and Irons play present-day actors who are making a film about two people having an affair in Victorian England.  The actors themselves are also involved in an affair, making the story a sort of movie-within-a-movie.  I have not read the Fowles novel, so I don't have any of the gripes that other reviewers have voiced.  I can only tell you that the story, the performances, the settings, the cinematography and the writing are all first-rate.  All connected with this film obviously took a lot of time and effort to make a visually stunning film.  It still looks great 20 years after its release, and looks even better on DVD (despite the fact that the disc offers no extras except the theatrical trailer...oh well...).  Even if you end up hating the story, I don't think anyone would complain about the superior performances by Irons and Streep.Possibly the reason this film has been largely forgotten is the timing.  This film was released in 1981, a year or two before Streep's blow-you-away performance in 'Sophie's Choice.'  That performance was so spectacular that many have forgotten just how good 'French Lt.' is.

281308,A106016KSI0YQ,6301969626,Jay Dickson,"[2, 2]","Meryl Streep's performance as Sarah Woodruff, the tormented titular heroine of this Karel Reisz adaptation of John Fowles's Hardyesque novel, made an enormous impression in this 1981 movie; Streep was the favorite that year to win the Academy Award (though she lost out in a sentimental upset to Katharine Hepburn). Although her line readings are gorgeously nuanced, the rest of her performance has suffered over the years: in particular her erotic twitchings before Jeremy Irons (especially in the climactic scene in an Exeter hotel) seem pretty silly today, as does her ridiculous, wildly oversized Pre-Raphaelite red wig, which while admittedly is not Streep's fault, is so attention-getting that it deserved its own credit above the film's title.Freddie Francis's famously sumptuous cinematography still astonishes today; the scenes in Exeter and Windermere are topped only by the Edenic scenery of the Undercliff near Lyme Regis. The screenplay was an admirable attempt by Harold Pinter to solve the quandary of how to convey the postmodern distancing effects of the narrator and the footnotes from the original Fowles novel by treating the central Victorian narrative of Sarah Woodruff and her paleontologist lover (Irons) as a film-within-a-film, with the actors played by Streep and Irons in the frame narrative carrying on an illicit affair (their modern characters are married, but not to each other). Unfortunately, the net effect is that the modern characters never seem fleshed out enough that you care much about what happens to them, and they only pull time away from the details of the far more interesting Victorian story that were the greatest point of originality of Fowles's original novel.",3,"Bewigged, bothered, and bewildered",1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,1710,"['Meryl', 'Streep', 'performance', 'Sarah', 'Woodruff', 'tormented', 'titular', 'heroine', 'Karel', 'Reisz', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Fowles', 'Hardyesque', 'novel', 'made', 'enormous', 'impression', '1981', 'movie', 'Streep', 'was', 'favorite', 'year', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'lost', 'out', 'sentimental', 'upset', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'line', 'readings', 'are', 'gorgeously', 'nuanced', 'rest', 'performance', 'suffered', 'years', 'particular', 'erotic', 'twitchings', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'especially', 'climactic', 'scene', 'Exeter', 'hotel', 'seem', 'pretty', 'silly', 'today', 'ridiculous', 'wildly', 'oversized', 'Pre-Raphaelite', 'red', 'wig', 'admittedly', 'not', 'Streep', 'fault', 'so', 'attention-getting', 'deserved', 'own', 'credit', 'film', 'title.Freddie', 'Francis', 'famously', 'sumptuous', 'cinematography', 'still', 'today', 'scenes', 'Exeter', 'Windermere', 'are', 'topped', 'only', 'Edenic', 'scenery', 'Undercliff', 'Lyme', 'Regis', 'screenplay', 'was', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'solve', 'quandary', 'how', 'convey', 'postmodern', 'distancing', 'effects', 'narrator', 'footnotes', 'original', 'Fowles', 'novel', 'treating', 'central', 'Victorian', 'narrative', 'Sarah', 'Woodruff', 'paleontologist', 'lover', 'Irons', 'film-within-a-film', 'actors', 'played', 'Streep', 'Irons', 'frame', 'narrative', 'carrying', 'illicit', 'affair', 'modern', 'characters', 'are', 'married', 'not', 'other', 'Unfortunately', 'net', 'effect', 'modern', 'characters', 'never', 'seem', 'fleshed', 'out', 'care', 'much', 'what', 'only', 'pull', 'time', 'away', 'details', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Victorian', 'story', 'were', 'greatest', 'point', 'originality', 'Fowles', 'original', 'novel']",N/A
281309,A1K2BPKCVJ6CT8,6301969626,Jinx,"[10, 11]","Most of John Fowles' novels, including TFLW, tease us by unexpectedly revealing and obscuring the line between the world in the book and a wider world in which we are reading the book, throwing us off balance, reminding us that we have traveled into the author's invented reality, inviting us to question our own reality. Characters in his books are puzzled, then believe they have figured it out, and then are thrown again into confusion. TFLW also was full of modern-perspective commentary about the Victorian world by an omniscient narrator, another device to pull us back and forth across the reality line. How to convey in a movie this uneasy element in the story, and still immerse us in the vivid passionate immediacy of the dangerous and irresistable love affair?

Still, I must give plaudits to the screenplay by Harold Pinter, as the book with its alternative endings is a little difficult to capture on film. Still, that is just what Pinter did here in a symbolic and ingenious sort of way, with two parallel stories, one contemporary, one victorian. Coupled with deft direction by Karel Reisz and stunning cinematography, the film fully engages the viewer.The film is beautifully acted by Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons. Steep is possitively luminous in the role of the enigmatic Sarah Woodruff, a Victorian woman who is wrongfully castigated by her neighbors for being a scarlet woman. Jeremy Edwards is excellent as Charles, the gentleman who becomes obsessed with her and loses his reputation in order to remain free to pursue her.Streep is also excellent in the role of the married Anne, the contemporary actress with whom Mike (Jeremy Irons), her costar in a film, is having an affair. He is, however, disatisfied with Anne's casual attentions and wants more. Anne and Mike became lovers while filming &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman&quot; with Anne playing the role of Sarah Woodruff and Mike in the role of Charles.Pinter skilfully weaves these two stories together, making for an unusual cinematic experience, which, while not faithful to the book, is compelling, nonetheless.

But this film is actually two love stories.  Streep and Irons also play contemporary actors making a film of the 19th century love story, and their relationship clearly parallels the story they are filming.  Sarah Woodruff (Streep), known as ""the French Lieutenant's woman,"" is an outcast in mid-19th century Lyme Regis, where she lives, because she has broken the taboos of society.  Needing work to stay alive, she must accept the stultifying strictures of Victorian society and work as a governess or lady's companion, or become a prostitute, the only other option open for a woman without an inheritance or family.Charles Smithson (Jeremy Irons), an amateur geologist and Darwinian in the early story, is the rather stuffy fianc&eacute; of Ernestina Freeman (Lynsey Baxter).  Smithson becomes the only person offering to help Sarah when, concerned for her safety, he follows her out onto a slippery quay during a storm.  Despite his engagement and the fact that Sarah keeps herself a mystery, he is increasingly drawn to her and wants to know her story.  Meanwhile, Mike the actor (Irons) and Anna the actress (Streep) playing these parts in the film, are having an affair, each ignoring their marital obligations in their attempt to find excitement.The cinematography (Freddie Francis) emphasizes the lush countryside, the untamed sea, and the seaside community, with its ancient buildings.  Several dark interior scenes of second-rate hotels add emphasis to the precarious position of someone like Sarah who has loved too well and lost.  Music (Carl Davis) sets the scene throughout the film--mournful music as Sarah walks the storm-washed quay followed by cheerful music as Irons goes in a carriage to visit his fianc&eacute;e, mysterious music when Sarah and Charles are dealing with the mystery of the past, and sentimental violin music at the conclusion.Streep (nominated for the Academy Award for her role) is stunning, portraying Sarah Woodruff as mysterious but emotionally vulnerable as she tries to control her own life.  As the contemporary character, Streep is beautiful, sexy, and vulnerable.  Irons is less effective, appearing distant and repressed in both roles, and the depth of his attraction for both Sarah and Anna does not seem very credible.  Nevertheless, this is an fascinating film in the grand tradition, a beautifully filmed study of the interrelationship of love and freedom-two love stories with two appropriate endings.

However in this case I must say it.The book was so wonderful and the decision to hack it up as Pinter did here is a big mistake.It's one of those clever ideas that sounds good, but when you actually see it, it adds nothing to the story and seriously detracts from it.  The basic story is fascinating and we are quickly drawn into the the mystery of the French Lieutenant's Woman, played gorgeously by Meryl Street and how her life becomes entwined with that of Charles Smithson, played by Jeremy Irons.  It's definitely Streep's film, the one that made her a major star.  Irons fills the shoes of his character adequately but is definitely lackluster compared to Streep.In the parallel, modern day version, we don't get enough back story to enlist our interest in these characters to care about them.  The Streep character comes across as simply flirtatious; we never know if she really cares about the man, Irons, or if she's just playing with him, and ultimately we don't care.  I found the modern day scenes intrusive and kept wanting the film to switch back to the main story.It's been so long since I've read the novel that I don't remember if it gave more plausibility for Sarah's actions.

When I awake, the nightmare begins."" ~Sarah WoodruffThe first few scenes in this movie are so terribly sad if you have seen the movie at least once before. In the first few scenes all you see is a lone figure walking along the projecting sea wall (Cobb). Sarah Woodruff is looking out to sea for her lover's return. It is all so tragic. This story is set in the coastal town of Lyme Regis, famous for its fossils and now also famous for this movie.For some reason, the first scenes are so symbolic of the entire loneliness both the fictional and real character play in the movie. This is a film-within-the-film and the stories follow similar themes. You could almost compare the style of this movie to the more recent ""Possession 2002.""The French Lieutenant's Woman was adapted from John Fowles' novel and is a parallel love story. One between forbidden lovers Sarah Woodruff (Meryl Streep) and Charles (Jeremy Irons) in the 19th century, and then a romance between Anna and Mike who play Sarah and Charles when the Victorian romance is not being filmed. It is confusing at first, but soon you are watching this movie five times and have no idea why. It is rather romantic!There are of course two endings, one for each story. I can't decide which I loved best. They are just both so overwhelming.If you watch closely, you will see a scene where Sarah shows Charles a bit of her slip as she walks away. I always heard that meant a woman was looking for a husband. I didn?t notice it until the fourth time I was watching the movie. Sarah is technically an unfulfilled romantic. She is quite dramatic and very amusing at times. When she is going into a very serious speech, it can at times become dramatic to the point of hilarity. You know she is completely in love with being a victim of fate. She also knows how to attract romance into her life with her various schemes. One is rather dangerous when she slips a note to Charles during tea.Charles is a curious soul. He finds Sarah to be a bit of a mystery and unlike other women he has met and courted. He literally hunts her down and watches this mystery as she glides through the misty forest by the sea. All Sarah wants to do is look out to sea and dream of a man saving her from her fantasy life as a scarlet woman. Charles loses all interest in his ammonite research and is also lost from the moment he sees Sarah. We feel mildly sorry for Ernestina Freeman (Lynsey Baxter) as she is so sweet and innocent and so deserving of love. Still, the girl can throw a pretty good tantrum!

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[1, 2]","This 1981 film version of a famous novel by John Fowles from a few years earlier stars Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons at the height of their youthful attractiveness if not  their fame.  Streep plays the dual roles of Sarah and Anna.  Sarah is the title character, a young Victorian woman whose life has seemingly been ruined by her relationship with a Frenchman who abandoned her.  Anna is the modern American actress who portrays her and who is involved in an affair with her costar, Mike, despite them both being in other committed relationships.  Jeremy Irons plays this actor, Mike, as well as Sarah's love interest in the film Charles.  Charles is a  paleontologist and wealthy man of leisure who while recently engaged to a silly rich girl  develops an obsession for the mysterious, forlorn but lovely Sarah.The movie was obviously filmed on location in England and is quite beautiful to look at with lush outdoor scenes and ornate Victorian interiors and costumes.  The story within a story approach was not used in the novel but the book would be particularly difficult to faithfully film because it has three alternate endings.  The problem with the alternate endings is partly and cleverly solved by using the modern days actors' relationship to portray one of the alternatives while Sarah and Charles' story ends in another possible conclusion offered by the novel.  The movie should appeal to those who love the Victorian era, romances or Thomas Hardy as the story is quite reminiscent of some of his novels.",4,Story Within A Story Concept Works Beautifully In This Film,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,1519,"['1981', 'film', 'version', 'famous', 'novel', 'John', 'Fowles', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'height', 'youthful', 'attractiveness', 'not', 'fame', 'Streep', 'dual', 'roles', 'Sarah', 'Anna', 'Sarah', 'title', 'character', 'young', 'Victorian', 'woman', 'life', 'seemingly', 'been', 'ruined', 'relationship', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'abandoned', 'Anna', 'modern', 'American', 'actress', 'who', 'who', 'involved', 'affair', 'costar', 'Mike', 'being', 'other', 'committed', 'relationships', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'actor', 'Mike', 'as', 'well', 'Sarah', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'Charles', 'Charles', 'paleontologist', 'wealthy', 'man', 'leisure', 'who', 'recently', 'engaged', 'silly', 'rich', 'girl', 'obsession', 'mysterious', 'forlorn', 'lovely', 'Sarah.The', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'location', 'England', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'look', 'lush', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'ornate', 'Victorian', 'interiors', 'costumes', 'story', 'story', 'approach', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'novel', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'faithfully', 'film', 'three', 'alternate', 'endings', 'problem', 'alternate', 'endings', 'partly', 'cleverly', 'solved', 'using', 'modern', 'days', 'actors', 'relationship', 'portray', 'one', 'alternatives', 'Sarah', 'Charles', 'story', 'ends', 'possible', 'conclusion', 'offered', 'novel', 'movie', 'should', 'appeal', 'who', 'love', 'Victorian', 'era', 'romances', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'story', 'quite', 'reminiscent', 'novels']",N/A
281327,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6301969626,Themis-Athena,"[25, 28]","""Outside of marriage, your Victorian gentleman could look forward to 2.4 f*cks a week,"" Mike (Jeremy Irons) coolly calculates after Anna (Meryl Streep) has read to him the statistics according to which, while London's male population in 1857 was 1 1/4 million, the city's estimated 80,000 prostitutes were receiving a total of 2 million clients per week.  And frequently, Anna adds, the women thus forced to earn their living came from respectable positions like that of a governess, simply having fallen into bad luck, e.g. by being discharged after a dispute with their employer and their resulting inability to find another position.This brief dialogue towards the beginning of this movie based on John Fowles's 1969 novel succinctly illustrates both the fate that would most likely have been in store for title character Sarah (Meryl Streep in her ""movie within the movie"" role), had she left provincial Lyme Regis on Dorset's Channel coast and gone to London, and the Victorian society's moral duplicity:  For while no virtues were regarded as highly as honor, chastity and integrity; while no woman intent on keeping her good name could even be seen talking to a man alone (let alone go beyond that); and while marriage - like any contract - was considered sacrosanct, rendering the partner who deigned to breach it an immediate social outcast, all these rules were suspended with regard to prostitutes; women who, for whatever reasons, had sunk so low they were regarded as nonpersons and thus, inherently unable to stain anybody's reputation but their own.Appearances would have it that Sarah, too, is just such a woman - however, appearances can be deceptive; and herein lies the starting point of the story's social criticism:  Realizing that once society has unjustifiedly placed her in that position, nothing she does will ever wipe away the mark of disgrace she wears as ""the scarlet woman of Lyme,"" Sarah seeks strength in her very role as a pariah; trying to find a liberty not allowed to women of ""good"" society who are bound by the era's moral prerogatives; and to create a space for herself where she is untouchable because it is too far beyond the accepted social boundaries.  In this, she resembles Nathaniel Hawthorne's Hester Prynne (who however, unlike Sarah, actually had committed the adultery she was accused of).  But Sarah's attempt to salvage at least a fraction of her sense of self dramatically fails when she is discharged by conservative old Mrs. Poulteney (Patience Collier) for ""exhibiting her shame"" by having been seen - against her employer's express prohibition - on an undercliff overlooking the sea across which her supposed suitor, the French lieutenant to whom she owes her less-than-charitable epithet and reputation, disappeared, never to return.  Desperate, she literally throws herself at the feet of Charles Smithson (Jeremy Irons), who although recently engaged to local merchant Freeman's daughter Ernestina (Lynsey Baxter) has taken more than just a slight interest in her, and who to her has thus become the proverbial white knight in shining armor.  Charles in turn, unable to contain his infatuation with Sarah, casts aside the well-meaning counsel of physician Dr. Grogan (Leo McKern) (who considers Sarah's condition a classic case of ""obscure melancholia"" and would like to see her committed to an asylum) and breaks his engagement with Ernestina, thus incurring social shame himself, to be free for Sarah ... only to find her gone when he returns to take her home.Faced with the impossibility of creating a screenplay from a novel set in the Victorian Age but told from a 20th century perspective, interspersed with the author's frequent modern-day commentary, in order to maintain that duality, acclaimed playwright Harold Pinter opted for a ""movie within a movie"" scenario, allowing modern-day actors Mike and Anna to give the commentary provided by Fowles himself in the book.  But more than that, Anna and Mike are also a foil for Sarah and Charles in that they are engaged in an extramarital affair; and while late 20th century morality is obviously different from that of the Victorian Age, they, too, must decide what is to become of their romance.  And in both cases, it is Sarah/Anna who ultimately makes the decision:  In Fowles's novel, one that invites Charles to respond and whose outcome will lastly depend on his response (the author provides two different conclusions, leaving it up to his readers to determine the one most convincing to them); but in the the two actors's case, Anna presents Mike with a fait-accompli, contrasting with the end of Sarah's and Charles's story in the movie.Sublimely capturing the story's gothic atmosphere with its candlelit rooms, stormy nights and a haunted woman who - particularly when first seen standing at the edge of a quay, oblivious to the winds and raging waves around her - appears more like a ghost than a human being, ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" is perfectly cast with Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons in the dual roles of Sarah/Anna and Charles/Mike:  While outwardly quite different (Anna is upbeat but rational, Sarah passionate and vulnerable), both women ultimately find strength within themselves, whereas both men are sensitive and generally quieter, although Charles especially is Sarah's passionate equal once his feelings are stirred.  Scored by Carl Davis and also boasting a strong supporting cast - including appearances by Hilton McRae (Charles's manservant Sam), Emily Morgan (Ernestina's maid Mary), Colin Jeavons (the vicar who, attempting to help Sarah, introduces her to Mrs. Poulteney), Gerard Falconetti (Anna's husband Davide) and Penelope Wilton (Mike's wife Sonia) - ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" won a Golden Globe for Meryl Streep (Best Actress) and several British awards, but none of its five Oscar nominations (Best Actress, Screenplay, Art Direction, Costume Design and Editing - Jeremy Irons unfairly didn't even earn a ""Best Actor"" nomination).  Yet, this is a compelling production, bringing to life Fowles's complex characters in a thoroughly convincing, poignant fashion; and sure to leave a lasting impression.Also recommended:The French
