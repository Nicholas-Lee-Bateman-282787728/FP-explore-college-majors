1270690,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B002IRYYPU,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[3, 6]","It's not very often that I eagerly anticipate a Dolph Lundgren film, but ""Command Performance"" was an exception. Granted, other than that it would feature Dolph exercising his little-known talent of drumming for the first time on film, the movie didn't promote itself as anything particularly out-of-the-ordinary (with the possible exception that it promised a showdown between Lundgren and Dave `Fenrir Greyback' Legeno of the later ""Harry Potter"" films), but the general expectations regarding this film were surprisingly high in the DTV realm. I expected director Dolph to deliver something unexpected and explosive - perhaps even something to redefine himself as an action hero - so I fully admit that the major disappointment I suffered while watching this film is solely my fault...but that doesn't make this film any less boring.The story: during a Moscow charity concert headlined by the rock back CMF and pop singer Venus (""Making the Band"" alumnus Melissa Smith), a Soviet terrorist faction headed by self-styled patriot Oleg Kazov (Legeno) storms the theater and takes the Russian president (Hristo Shopov, ""The Passion of the Christ"") and his guests captive. Undetected by the attackers, the drummer of the rock band (Lundgren) must team up with a lone FSB agent (Zahary Baharov,Universal Soldier: Regeneration) to rescue the president and save the remaining hostages.Yes, Lundgren has chocked up another entry into theDie Hard-knockoff series, in addition to 1997'sThe Peacekeeper.  While I take some pleasure in writing the words ""Die Hard at a concert"", the opportunities offered by this premise end after Lundgren shoves a drumstick through a man's face and later impales another fellow with a broken guitar neck; as neat as these depictions of instrumental brutality are, they are not enough to save a movie stuck in toothless mediocrity. The storyline unfolds (or, rather, unrolls like a ream of toilet paper) without any turns or character revelations to keep you very interested. The film was entirely shot via the `shaky camera technique', which was no doubt supposed to allude to the ""Bourne"" movies but failed to deter my thoughts beyond how cheap it looked. As far as the acting goes, Melissa Smith does her best to channel Britney Spears in her depiction of a ditzy pop princess while Dolph's attempts to act like a socially-awkward cool guy indeed come off as awkward...but not very cool. I suppose the rest of the cast is passable, but I was disappointed that the Russian characters didn't speak a lot of Russian; movies likeDriven to Killare proving that authentic Russian is cooler than bad accents, but this one hasn't caught on to that.And as for action? What action, I ask? ""Command Performance"" aims for a gritty, realistic approach to its gunplay and fisticuffs, but the result is but a bit of thoroughly uninspired punching and exactly one shootout (that isn't entirely one-sided). Everything else simply falls under plain violence - people being shot, executed, etc. What little fighting there is, however, is remarkably bloody for a Lundgren flick (stabbed in the head with a knife, anybody?), as though Dolph was trying to interest the current slasher market. Doesn't help that half of the blood if CGI, though. Even the climatic Lundgren vs. Legeno encounter is a plodding, disappointing affair that wouldn't even draw in MMA nuts who are used to a lot of rolling around on the ground.It's been a very long time since Dolph has actually managed to disappoint me, much less raise my expectations in the first place, but I'm afraid I've been reminded that even one of my favorite action suppliers is capable of outright failure. Later in the film, Lundgren's character remarks about his band ""We don't rehearse - we just play"", and that is what this movie feels like: it would have required a lot more preparation and brainstorming before it would be anything beyond a forgettable direct-to-video flick.",2,"Dying is easy, rock & roll is hard, and saving this movie is harder",1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,3940,"['not', 'very', 'often', 'eagerly', 'anticipate', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'film', 'Command', 'Performance', 'was', 'exception', 'Granted', 'other', 'would', 'feature', 'Dolph', 'exercising', 'little-known', 'talent', 'drumming', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'promote', 'anything', 'particularly', 'out-of-the-ordinary', 'possible', 'exception', 'promised', 'showdown', 'Lundgren', 'Dave', 'Fenrir', 'Greyback', 'Legeno', 'later', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'general', 'expectations', 'regarding', 'film', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'DTV', 'realm', 'expected', 'director', 'Dolph', 'deliver', 'something', 'unexpected', 'explosive', 'perhaps', 'even', 'something', 'redefine', 'action', 'hero', 'so', 'fully', 'admit', 'major', 'disappointment', 'suffered', 'watching', 'film', 'solely', 'fault', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'less', 'boring.The', 'story', 'Moscow', 'charity', 'concert', 'headlined', 'rock', 'back', 'CMF', 'pop', 'singer', 'Venus', 'Making', 'Band', 'alumnus', 'Melissa', 'Smith', 'Soviet', 'terrorist', 'faction', 'headed', 'self-styled', 'patriot', 'Oleg', 'Kazov', 'Legeno', 'theater', 'Russian', 'president', 'Hristo', 'Shopov', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'guests', 'captive', 'Undetected', 'attackers', 'drummer', 'rock', 'band', 'Lundgren', 'must', 'team', 'up', 'lone', 'FSB', 'agent', 'Zahary', 'Baharov', 'Universal', 'Soldier', 'Regeneration', 'rescue', 'president', 'save', 'remaining', 'hostages.Yes', 'Lundgren', 'chocked', 'up', 'entry', 'theDie', 'Hard-knockoff', 'series', 'addition', ""1997'sThe"", 'Peacekeeper', 'take', 'pleasure', 'writing', 'words', 'Die', 'Hard', 'concert', 'opportunities', 'offered', 'premise', 'end', 'Lundgren', 'drumstick', 'man', 'face', 'later', 'impales', 'fellow', 'broken', 'guitar', 'neck', 'as', 'neat', 'depictions', 'instrumental', 'brutality', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'stuck', 'toothless', 'mediocrity', 'storyline', 'unfolds', 'rather', 'unrolls', 'ream', 'toilet', 'paper', 'turns', 'character', 'revelations', 'keep', 'very', 'interested', 'film', 'was', 'entirely', 'shot', 'shaky', 'camera', 'technique', 'was', 'doubt', 'supposed', 'allude', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'failed', 'deter', 'thoughts', 'how', 'cheap', 'looked', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'Melissa', 'Smith', 'best', 'channel', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'depiction', 'ditzy', 'pop', 'princess', 'Dolph', 'attempts', 'act', 'socially-awkward', 'cool', 'guy', 'indeed', 'come', 'off', 'awkward', 'not', 'very', 'cool', 'suppose', 'rest', 'cast', 'passable', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Russian', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'lot', 'Russian', 'movies', 'likeDriven', 'Killare', 'proving', 'authentic', 'Russian', 'cooler', 'bad', 'accents', 'one', ""n't"", 'caught', 'that.And', 'action', 'What', 'action', 'ask', 'Command', 'Performance', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'approach', 'gunplay', 'fisticuffs', 'result', 'bit', 'thoroughly', 'uninspired', 'punching', 'exactly', 'one', 'shootout', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'one-sided', 'Everything', 'else', 'simply', 'plain', 'violence', 'people', 'being', 'shot', 'executed', 'etc', 'What', 'little', 'fighting', 'however', 'remarkably', 'bloody', 'Lundgren', 'flick', 'stabbed', 'head', 'knife', 'anybody', 'Dolph', 'was', 'trying', 'interest', 'current', 'slasher', 'market', ""n't"", 'help', 'half', 'blood', 'CGI', 'Even', 'climatic', 'Lundgren', 'vs.', 'Legeno', 'encounter', 'plodding', 'disappointing', 'affair', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'draw', 'MMA', 'nuts', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'lot', 'rolling', 'around', 'ground.It', 'been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Dolph', 'actually', 'managed', 'disappoint', 'much', 'less', 'raise', 'expectations', 'first', 'place', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reminded', 'even', 'one', 'favorite', 'action', 'suppliers', 'capable', 'outright', 'failure', 'Later', 'film', 'Lundgren', 'character', 'remarks', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'rehearse', 'just', 'play', 'what', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'lot', 'more', 'preparation', 'brainstorming', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'forgettable', 'direct-to-video', 'flick']",N/A

The writing never really alludes to how he can be so proficient with guns, knives, bombs, fighting - and playing the drums, but we do not watch these for the writing.The Blu was of average quality, and certain cameras showcase a great deal of grain more than others. The 5.1 sounds good, and your outer channels and sub will get plenty of work. Not a reference BD by any means, but adequate enough for a low cost that it should not disappoint in those categories. Now the issues - there are special features listed on the case including interviews, behind the scenes and extra fight footage. I tried every which way to find them (looked for hidden commands, menu icons, easter eggs, watched through the credits for return to menu, pop-up menu, etc.) and I could not find a thing. Have not had that happen before with any BD, so I tried both my PS3 and stand alone players to be sure, no luck.If you are a fan of Dolph I think this would be a good addition to the library, or if you are looking for a standard action film (and actually there are not too many of the yeah-right moments in this one) this could entertain for an evening.

1270701,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002IRYYPU,trebe,"[2, 3]","For a while now, Dolph Lundgren has been directing himself, in projects of his choosing.  Qualitywise, these efforts have ranged in the middle ground, being neither disasters, nor great.  Displaying some originality, Command Performance (2009), falls in the upper end of that same range.  Lundgren does triple duty, as star, director, and contributor to the screenplay.  Usually favoring low-key personas, in depth character development, is not a strong point in many of Lundgren's films.  That is also the case here, as he plays Joe, a drummer in a rock band, thrust into a violent situation, when terrorists invade a concert arena, and take the Russian President hostage.Making a command performance, at the request of President Dimitri Petrov (Hristo Shopov), pop star Venus (Melissa Smith), is the headliner for a charity concert in Moscow.  Also on the bill are the rock band Pilgrim, for whom the imposing Joe, impressively pounds the drums.  While Venus is onstage, terrorists enter the venue and take control, shooting into the crowd, and capturing Petrov and his two daughters, who are big Venus fans.  Oleg Kazov (Dave Legeno) the leader of the terrorists, uses a captured TV camera crew to transmit his ransom demands, to the Russian army surrounding the arena.A drugged up Joe, seems like an unlikely hero, but he soon comes out of his haze, shoving a drumstick through a mercenary's skull.  Joe teams up with Mikhail Kapista (Zahary Baharov), a member of the president's security team, and Venus, who has also managed to get free.  Though hardly an ideal fighting team, they look for a way to save the President.The focus isn't totally on Joe the drummer, and Lundgren has time to devote to directing others.  He does a capable job, particularly with action sequences.  The story has some depth and texture, but there are times when things get too cartoonish or overdramatic.  The violence is overdone in places, but Command Performance holds together well enough, adopting a mostly serious tone.  The Russian army is largely inept, mostly used to fill in background information about Kazov.  To save his daughters, the President is forced to take matters into his own hands.  In the end, Joe picks up some new fans, and even cracks a smile, as he rides off with Venus.Although the reality factor is not very high, this is a fairly enjoyable film.  The character Joe, while the typical strong silent type, actually has a little personality, and for a change is not some ex-military type.  There are no big co-stars, but Melissa Smith displays some range, and also provides the vocals for the featured song, Lost In Love.  The group D2, contributes the rock numbers attributed to the band Pilgrim.",3,"Joe the drummer, rocking hard with the President of Russia . . .",1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,2709,"['while', 'now', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'been', 'directing', 'projects', 'choosing', 'Qualitywise', 'efforts', 'have', 'ranged', 'middle', 'ground', 'being', 'disasters', 'great', 'Displaying', 'originality', 'Command', 'Performance', '2009', 'upper', 'end', 'same', 'range', 'Lundgren', 'triple', 'duty', 'star', 'director', 'contributor', 'screenplay', 'Usually', 'favoring', 'low-key', 'personas', 'depth', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'strong', 'point', 'many', 'Lundgren', 'films', 'also', 'case', 'here', 'Joe', 'drummer', 'rock', 'band', 'thrust', 'violent', 'situation', 'when', 'terrorists', 'invade', 'concert', 'arena', 'take', 'Russian', 'President', 'hostage.Making', 'command', 'performance', 'request', 'President', 'Dimitri', 'Petrov', 'Hristo', 'Shopov', 'pop', 'star', 'Venus', 'Melissa', 'Smith', 'headliner', 'charity', 'concert', 'Moscow', 'Also', 'bill', 'are', 'rock', 'band', 'Pilgrim', 'whom', 'imposing', 'Joe', 'impressively', 'drums', 'Venus', 'onstage', 'terrorists', 'enter', 'venue', 'take', 'control', 'shooting', 'crowd', 'capturing', 'Petrov', 'two', 'daughters', 'who', 'are', 'big', 'Venus', 'fans', 'Oleg', 'Kazov', 'Dave', 'Legeno', 'leader', 'terrorists', 'captured', 'TV', 'camera', 'crew', 'transmit', 'ransom', 'demands', 'Russian', 'army', 'surrounding', 'arena.A', 'drugged', 'up', 'Joe', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'soon', 'haze', 'shoving', 'drumstick', 'mercenary', 'skull', 'Joe', 'up', 'Mikhail', 'Kapista', 'Zahary', 'Baharov', 'member', 'president', 'security', 'team', 'Venus', 'who', 'also', 'managed', 'get', 'free', 'Though', 'hardly', 'ideal', 'fighting', 'team', 'look', 'way', 'save', 'President.The', 'focus', ""n't"", 'totally', 'Joe', 'drummer', 'Lundgren', 'time', 'devote', 'directing', 'others', 'capable', 'job', 'particularly', 'action', 'sequences', 'story', 'depth', 'texture', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'cartoonish', 'overdramatic', 'violence', 'overdone', 'places', 'Command', 'Performance', 'together', 'well', 'enough', 'adopting', 'mostly', 'serious', 'tone', 'Russian', 'army', 'largely', 'inept', 'mostly', 'used', 'fill', 'background', 'information', 'Kazov', 'save', 'daughters', 'President', 'forced', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'end', 'Joe', 'up', 'new', 'fans', 'even', 'smile', 'Venus.Although', 'reality', 'factor', 'not', 'very', 'high', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'character', 'Joe', 'typical', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'actually', 'little', 'personality', 'change', 'not', 'ex-military', 'type', 'are', 'big', 'co-stars', 'Melissa', 'Smith', 'range', 'also', 'vocals', 'featured', 'song', 'Lost', 'Love', 'group', 'D2', 'rock', 'numbers', 'attributed', 'band', 'Pilgrim']",N/A
1270702,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002IRYYPU,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","A rock band drummer named Joe takes on a terrorist group that took the Russian president as hostage. ""Command Performance"" is already referred to as ""Die Hard at a rock concert,"" but the story of the Nu Image action film, starring and co-written/directed by Dolph Lundgren, may be closer to that of Jean-Claude Van Damme's ""Sudden Death"" (1995).Anyway, Dolph Lundgren is Joe, a veteran drummer of the rock band C.M.F, signed as the opening act for the American pop star Venus (Melissa Molinaro credited as Melissa Smith). During the concert, a group of terrorists start raising hell, shooting the audiences and security guards before taking hostage President Petrov (Hristo Shopov, Pontius Pilate of Mel Gibson's ""Passion""), US Ambassador Bradley (Clement von Franckenstein) and the president's two teenage daughters Anna and Yana. (Incidentally, Anna is played by Dolph Lundgren's real-life daughter Ida.)The film has some slack moments and the storyline is predicable, but ""Command Performance"" delivers what it promises, a solid B action thriller. There are quite a few bloody shootings and fights, plus (literally) blasting guitar sound, which is surely fun to watch.The idea of a biker-turned-rock drummer-turned-action hero is hardly believable, but so is Casey Ryback, a Navy SEAL operator-turned-chef, and ""Under Siege"" is pretty entertaining movie. ""Command Performance"" is a decent direct-to-DVD action (and the live concert part is not bad). Not much originality, but the film has some tongue-in-cheek moments such as the character President Petrov, obviously inspired by Vladimir Putin, former Russian president and judo practitioner (see how Petrov knocks down one of the terrorists).
