Each one highlights a different method used of breaking down the individual, each with its own degree of success or failure.One of the standouts of this set is Leo McKern's portrayal of one of the villainous Number Twos.  His character is a delight to watch -- unpredictable, amusing and dangerous.  The other Number Twos on this DVD are certainly passable.  Colin Gordon appears twice and his character isn't nearly as strong as McKern's, yet the episodes featuring him reflect this, letting Patrick McGoohan's Prisoner subtlety undermine his authority.The whole series of The Prisoner comes highly recommended, but this particular set would be an excellent choice to show someone unfamiliar with the show.  The four episodes contained (&quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben&quot;, &quot;A, B and C&quot; and &quot;The General&quot;) exemplify the best of 60's style paranoia and individualism-over-conformity that is still important today.",5,"If you only get one Prisoner set, get this one",994809600,"07 11, 2001",2001,1132,"['plan', 'purchasing', 'only', 'single', 'set', 'Prisoner', 'DVDs', 'then', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'one', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'finest', 'series', 'produced', 'one', 'different', 'method', 'used', 'breaking', 'down', 'individual', 'own', 'degree', 'success', 'failure.One', 'standouts', 'set', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'portrayal', 'one', 'villainous', 'Number', 'Twos', 'character', 'delight', 'watch', 'unpredictable', 'amusing', 'dangerous', 'other', 'Number', 'Twos', 'DVD', 'are', 'certainly', 'passable', 'Colin', 'Gordon', 'twice', 'character', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'strong', 'McKern', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'reflect', 'letting', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'Prisoner', 'subtlety', 'undermine', 'authority.The', 'whole', 'series', 'Prisoner', 'highly', 'recommended', 'particular', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'choice', 'show', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'show', 'four', 'episodes', 'contained', 'quot', 'Checkmate', 'quot', 'quot', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'quot', 'quot', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'quot', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'exemplify', 'best', '60', 'style', 'paranoia', 'individualism-over-conformity', 'still', 'important', 'today']","The Prisoner - Set 2: Checkmate/ The Chimes of Big Ben/ A, B and C/ The General"
558463,A36RRLVEBABY5Z,B00004Y7E1,"Axel Law ""The Happy Seizure Kid""","[1, 1]","Back in 1967, an allegorical television show emerged that has yet to be topped by any other English television series. The show: The Prisoner. Starring Patrick McGoohan, he plays the role of No. 6, a former secret service agent who resigned for unknown reasons and then finds himself knocked unconscious and trapped in a seemingly peaceful place called &quot;the Village.&quot; Each episode features a new No. 2 (with a few exceptions), who watches his every move and strives to find out why he resigned. The only superior is the unseen No. 1, the supposed ruler of the Village. The only other characters that reoccur are The Supervisor (also called Controller), played by Peter Stanwick, and The Butler, played by Angelo Muscat.In &quot;Checkmate,&quot; the Prisoner is inspired to gather other people who still have their individuality after watching a chess game in which people act as the pawns in the game and are told to move by the chess player.  The question asked in this episode is whether or not we are pawns in life.  This harks back to the pilot episode &quot;Arrival,&quot; when the retired admiral tells a woman that &quot;we're all pawns.&quot;In &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben,&quot; a russian agent (?) is brought to The Village and is in the same exact position that the Prisoner's in.  He decides to cooperate in the arts &amp; crafts show so that she'll not get hurt... but of course, he still is defiant towards Number 2.  One of my favorites in the series, he is hesitant on whether or not he should trust this beautiful russian prisoner.In &quot;A,B, and C,&quot; the Prisoner is sedated and captured in a laboratory.  The new Number 2 uses untested drugs to probe through his dreams to find out why he resigned.  An interesting plot point at the end keeps this from being average, as we find out that the Prisoner did not intend to sell out.In &quot;The General,&quot; the same Number 2 returns, this time utilizing a &quot;speed learning&quot; program (run by the Professor, sort of...) in which everyone learns something in merely 15 seconds.  What Number 6 soon realizes is that one merely memorizes the information as opposed to learning it.  This one's hard to analyze, but I think McGoohan tried to convey the message that technology is getting the better of us, and the technology is interfering with the growth of knowledge (either that, or we are misusing the technology to that effect.).The Butler never speaks.  He always serves his master faithfully and unconditionally.  In the &quot;Prisoner Companion&quot; that came with the DVD set (or if you get the &quot;Fall Out&quot; volume), it is stated that the Butler represents all the little people in the world who blindly follow the strongest leader just so they'll be alright.  I agree with that.  What's up with the Bicycle?  We see it on the number badges, the signs, and practically everywhere else in the Village.  Could it mean that technology is getting the better of us (as supposedly stated in &quot;The General&quot;), or could it mean that we should slow the growth of technology?  I agree with the latter, although the first possibility could be a true statement.&quot;Questions are a burden to others.&quot;&quot;Answers are a prison for oneself.&quot;Two phrases used prominently throughout the Village.  These two are probably individuality at its most basic.  Without questions, you cannot build on friendships or even just simply gain knowledge!  Without answers, one simply doesn't know and is forever confined in secrecy.  This leads someone to think for themselves and form opinions.  Naturally, opinions are not allowed in the Village.A great series with messages in each episode.  Preferably, I give every episode 5 stars, but I highly recommend getting the megaset and watching the series all the way through as opposed to the individual volumes.",5,&quot;W.  H.  Y.

558464,A3R4TS03ITT2JC,B00004Y7E1,Bob Thompson,"[3, 3]","These four episodes capture &quot;The Prisoner&quot; on its absolute best form. Each of the episodes are equally thought provoking/unbelievable in their own way's.&quot;Checkmate&quot; begins with a gorgeously staged game of human chess. Number Six, a pawn tries throughout the episode to determine the structure of &quot;sides&quot; in the village. Particularly who his allies are. By the end he has staged an elaborate escape.&quot;The Chimes of Big Ben,&quot; at the moment my favorite all-time episode of the show is one of the cleverest things going. Six orchestrates a clever escape only to realize that he has been used as a guinea pig the whole time. Very intelligently written, with some of the swiftest dialogue around, &quot;Big Ben&quot; demonstrates how good television can be and how so many modern shows are just grand dissapointments.&quot;A,B and C&quot; has number Six being drugged by number Two in another attempt to trick answers of his resignation out of him. Number Six, being the Wily Coyote that he is sees through the plot and gives a metaphoric middle-finger to the village leaders at the end of the episode. Another incredibly satisfying episode.Final episode &quot;The General&quot; as well as being a great episode turns out to be quite prophetic in its observations of our current &quot;television culture.&quot; Here, village residents are taught university courses simply by watching subliminal messages through the television. Problem is, while they retain massive amounts of knowledge, nobody seems to understand any of it.  George Orwell seems like he would have had a big influence on this particularly intellectual episode.  Number Two is content in knowing that village residents are nothing more that &quot;knowledgeable cabbages.&quot; If this doesn't sum up current society I don't know what does.&quot;The Prisoner&quot; evolves into a thought provoking masterpiece in this box set. All the episodes are incredible and stand up to repeated viewing.Even by today's standards &quot;The Prisoner&quot; is ahead of it's time. &quot;X-Files&quot; is a joke compared to this.",5,Superior to the first box,978307200,"01 1, 2001",2001,2112,"['four', 'episodes', 'capture', 'quot', 'Prisoner', 'quot', 'absolute', 'best', 'form', 'episodes', 'are', 'equally', 'thought', 'provoking/unbelievable', 'own', ""way's."", 'quot', 'Checkmate', 'quot', 'gorgeously', 'staged', 'game', 'human', 'chess', 'Number', 'Six', 'pawn', 'episode', 'determine', 'structure', 'quot', 'sides', 'quot', 'village', 'Particularly', 'who', 'allies', 'are', 'end', 'staged', 'elaborate', 'escape.', 'quot', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'quot', 'moment', 'favorite', 'all-time', 'episode', 'show', 'one', 'cleverest', 'things', 'going', 'Six', 'clever', 'escape', 'only', 'realize', 'been', 'used', 'guinea', 'whole', 'time', 'Very', 'intelligently', 'written', 'swiftest', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'Big', 'Ben', 'quot', 'how', 'good', 'television', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'shows', 'are', 'just', 'grand', 'dissapointments.', 'quot', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'quot', 'number', 'Six', 'being', 'drugged', 'number', 'Two', 'attempt', 'trick', 'answers', 'resignation', 'Number', 'Six', 'being', 'Wily', 'Coyote', 'sees', 'plot', 'metaphoric', 'middle-finger', 'village', 'leaders', 'end', 'episode', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'episode.Final', 'episode', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'great', 'episode', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'prophetic', 'observations', 'current', 'quot', 'television', 'culture.', 'quot', 'Here', 'village', 'residents', 'are', 'taught', 'university', 'courses', 'simply', 'watching', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'television', 'Problem', 'retain', 'massive', 'amounts', 'knowledge', 'nobody', 'understand', 'George', 'Orwell', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'big', 'influence', 'particularly', 'intellectual', 'episode', 'Number', 'Two', 'content', 'knowing', 'village', 'residents', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'quot', 'knowledgeable', 'cabbages.', 'quot', ""n't"", 'sum', 'up', 'current', 'society', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'does.', 'quot', 'Prisoner', 'quot', 'thought', 'provoking', 'masterpiece', 'box', 'set', 'episodes', 'are', 'incredible', 'stand', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewing.Even', 'today', 'standards', 'quot', 'Prisoner', 'quot', 'ahead', 'time', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'joke', 'compared']","The Prisoner - Set 2: Checkmate/ The Chimes of Big Ben/ A, B and C/ The General"

558466,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00004Y7E1,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[2, 3]","THE PRISONERAmerican audience had never seen anything like The Prisoner on their t.v. sets when it first aired in June of 1968 on C.B.S.  This was a complete departure from the last series Patrick McGoohan had appeared in (Secret Agent Man) and the series was an inventive, intelligent, sometimes surreal and thought-provoking Kafka-esque journey into an Orwellian/Huxley like microcosm of society where an omnipotent authority ruled controlling  every aspect of people's lives..  Experiments were regularly performed on citizens to explore issues of conformity, manipulation, brain-washing, mind control.  At the time while most critics embraced the series, some lambasted it for being too cerebral, confusing and British!!!  McGoohan did not answer questions from the press regarding what series was about, or what he was saying in various episodes.  Critics grew a bit frustrated with him and expressed that frustration toward the end of the series.Today The Prisoner remains one of the finest television series ever made.  It is still an innovative, complex, inspiring and thought provoking series that at times is bizarre, controversial and perplexing.  It holds up well though some of the props are dated and not as psychedelic and futuristic as they once appeared, and there is a definite style to the proceedings that might take a new-comer an episode or two to get comfortable with.  Stick with it and you will be rewarded greatly for your effort and time.  The recent (October 31, 2000) DVD release is indeed cause for celebration.  The complaints of the audio and visual problems seem to have been somewhat exagerated and the severity of them may depend on the type of DVD player you have. There have been some problems however.If you are not acquainted with The Prisoner-it's time for you to change that.  There's even a tribute to it toward the end of The Matrix (did you notice?).Patrick McGoohan is Number 6.  In the pro-logue before each episode (a condensation of the first episode : The Arrival we see Number 6 resigning as a secret agent. He prepares to go on an extended holiday when he is knocked out and kidnapped.  When he wakes up he discovers he is in THE VILLAGE.  A too perfect, picaresque small town with the appearance of a quaint medieval town and all the conveniences of modern life.No one has a name in The Village however, only numbers.  McGoohan is Number 6 and he soon discovers it is nearly impossible to escape from the seemingly idyllic Village.  He is being watched by a well organized security force who answers to the person who runs The Village.  This person is Number 2.  Number 2 we will learn in subsequent episodes changes and answers to the un-seen Number 1.  Number 2's job is to find out the real reason why Number 6 resigned from being a secret agent and to keep order and control over the Village.  If you try to escape from the Village and somehow slip past the surveillance cameras and guards, you will be pursued and captured by a huge amorphous white ball (a weather balloon) that will absorb  you.  No one it seems has ever or can ever escape the village.  There seems to be a number of people however that are interested in escaping.  These people all seem to be various former spies or people with secrets who must be carefully watched and controlled.  They have information that is dangerous but most have served their government well and deserve respect.  Of course some of these villagers are actually working as part of the security team to insure that in fact no one can escape.All of the people in the village wear various types of `fun' clothing, and hair styles. Sometimes they even don costumes for various games and activities that continually are announced.  A lot of the games however are experiments in various forms of mind-control.  The chief mode of transportation for the `citizens' is walking.  Golf-cart like vehicles are used by Village workers, and technical personnel and as 'taxis'.Everything we experience in The Prisoner is through the perspective of Number 6.  We learn the Village's rules, we meet the various Village citizens and guests.  Number 6 is not unlike a lab rat in a complex physical and psychology maze.  Number 6 is a guarded man of ethics who's core beliefs we merely get glimpses of.  He insists he is more than just a number-but is he?  Has he become part of the experiment so completely he doesn't actually remember who he is and where he came from but for some fleeting glimpses?  And are these glimpses into a former life real memories or dreams?You should be getting the idea this is a complex series where ideas are introduced and suggested and the audience can come up with their own interpretations and ideas of what they mean.McGoohan's stylized intensity has a black comedy edge to it (perhaps somewhat campy to a new viewer of the series).  He is often photographed in a way that exaggerates his squinting eyes and barely controlled rage at being in an elaborate cage.  He speaks often with a clipped, no-nonsense speech pattern through seemingly permanently clenched teeth.  He is a man who seems like he is a split second form exploding into a violent rage. It's a delightful performance to watch and varies ingeniously throughout the episodes.  His outward intensity softens in latter episodes as he learns escaping will involve possibly orchestrating a series of complex events.The Prisoner t.v. series first aired in black and white in England in 1967 and in the U.S. on C.B.S. it first aired (in color) in June of 1968 was repeated in 1969 and re-ran many times on P.B.S. stations throughout the 1970s.  Originally McGoohan wanted to do 7 episodes (shades of Twin Peaks !!!), but main financier of the series Lew Grade insisted on 30 episodes so it could be re-sold later as a series.  McGoohan did not want to dilute the series by doing 30 episodes and a compromise was made for 17 episodes.  The production schedule however created some unforeseen problems.  The best order to watch the shows in is how they are being released on this new DVD version.DOES THE VILLAGE ACTUALLY EXIST?  Yes.  The main exterior setting of The Prisoner is an actual place in Wales UK called Port Meirion. It was built by Clough Williams-Ellis on his private peninsula on the coast of Snowdonia in Wales from 1925 to 1975 and is still a tourist attraction/retreat today.  Several famous people from Noel Coward to Alistair Sims vacationed there on a regular basis.  Patrick McGoohan was a friend of Clough and in 1966 secured his permission to film his t.v. series The Prisoner there.Patrick McGoohan  was  the creator and executive producer of the series (he also wrote and directed some episodes). David Tomblin was the Producer,  George Markstein was the script editor and the series was financed by ITC  It followed McGoohan's very popular Danger Man and later Secret Agent Man series in which McGoohan played a spy.  The Prisoner however isn't actually connected to the older more conventional series.The series featured many guest stars and appearances by famous actors, writers and up and coming stars which included: Leo McKern, Peter Bowles, Eric Portman, Patrick Cargill, Mary Morris, Paul Eddington , George Baker, Guy Doleman, Rosalie Crutchley, Donald Sinden, Ian Flemming(creator of James Bond),  and many others.Did you know Patrick McGoohan was originally offered the role of Bond before Sean Connery?The Chimes of Big Ben  is one of the best episodes of the entire series and features one of Leo McKern's delightful appearances as Number 2.  McKern's almost campy performance and the dialogue exchanges between McGoohan and McKern are highlights in an ultimately very dark edged episode of cat and mouse.A B &amp; C  may have dated a bit, but remains an ingenious episode focusing on the use of experimental drug which allows dreams and the subconscious to be manipulated.  The implications of such techniques are extremely disturbing of course.The General is an episode in which a technique called speed reading is being tested on the Village inhabitants.  While learning an entire college degree in a matter of a few days through a hypnotic like learning transmission seems like a great idea. . . we quickly realize how it can be used as yet another form of mind control and must be stopped.Checkmate is an episode where Number 6 learns there are ways in which he can identify Village inhabitants who haven't been brainwashed yet.  Indeed he is playing a very insidious game of chess with the unseen Number 1.Most of the episodes have clever twists and subtexts that explore  many facets of politics, goverment, censorship, the media, behavioral conditioning, societal experiments and more.I hope you'll soon discover perhaps the greatest television series ever made.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

As I've said before, Prisoner episodes are rather hit and miss - they are either average or superb.  We kick off with Checkmate where Number Six gathers a group of trusted villagers together and decides to find out who are the &quot;real&quot; prisoners and who are the wardens in disguise.  The Chimes of Big Ben sees Number Six team up with a Russian in an attempt to escape, A, B and C is a rather disturbing episode where Number Two decides to use a combination of drugs and a machine capable of projecting images into Number Six's brain in an attempt to get answers - even if it means killing him, and The General provides a somewhat confusing and weak ending to the set where Number Six tries to unmask the evil side of The General's &quot;Speedlearn&quot; courses where you can earn a degree in seconds as the information in blasted into your brain using a subliminal learning technique. So, 3 classic episodes followed by one average outing into the absurd.  What puzzles me is why Number Six left the partition in the crate in Chimes of Big Ben.  If you were going to be locked in a box with a beautiful Russan woman for hours and hours, wouldn't you find some interesting ways to pass the time?",5,THIS IS MORE LIKE IT,995328000,"07 17, 2001",2001,1452,"['Having', 'reviewed', 'Volume', '1', 'given', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'due', 'couple', 'average', 'episodes', 'next-to-unwatchable', 'alternative', 'version', 'quot', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'quot', 'can', 'now', 'finally', 'award', '5', 'stars', 'collection', '4', 'complete', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'said', 'Prisoner', 'episodes', 'are', 'rather', 'hit', 'miss', 'are', 'average', 'superb', 'kick', 'off', 'Checkmate', 'where', 'Number', 'Six', 'group', 'trusted', 'villagers', 'together', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'prisoners', 'who', 'are', 'wardens', 'disguise', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'Number', 'Six', 'up', 'Russian', 'attempt', 'escape', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'episode', 'where', 'Number', 'Two', 'decides', 'use', 'combination', 'drugs', 'machine', 'capable', 'projecting', 'images', 'Number', 'Six', 'brain', 'attempt', 'get', 'answers', 'even', 'killing', 'General', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'weak', 'ending', 'set', 'where', 'Number', 'Six', 'unmask', 'evil', 'side', 'General', 'quot', 'Speedlearn', 'quot', 'courses', 'where', 'can', 'earn', 'degree', 'seconds', 'information', 'blasted', 'brain', 'using', 'subliminal', 'learning', 'technique', 'So', '3', 'classic', 'episodes', 'followed', 'one', 'average', 'outing', 'absurd', 'What', 'why', 'Number', 'Six', 'left', 'partition', 'crate', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'locked', 'box', 'beautiful', 'Russan', 'woman', 'hours', 'hours', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'interesting', 'ways', 'pass', 'time']","The Prisoner - Set 2: Checkmate/ The Chimes of Big Ben/ A, B and C/ The General"
558468,A24VVTYRN7BBI3,B00004Y7E1,David H. Downing,"[4, 4]","Patrick McGoohan's classic 1967 miniseries begins as an offbeat spy thriller and ends as a surrealistic allegory.  It concerns an ex-secret agent (McGoohan)  held captive in The Village, a prison camp that looks like a vacation resort.  Everyone is identified solely by number, and our protagonist is No. 6.  The Village is managed by No. 2, who reports to an unseen and unidentified No. 1 -- and who gets replaced regularly.  THEY want to know why No. 6 resigned, he wants to know who THEY are and where he is.A&amp;E presents the miniseries in a revised order, intended to arrange events in their proper sequence, but having several additional benefits:-Showing No. 6's increasing level of confidence and command of his situation-Beginning with some of the more surrealistic episodes (in set 1), thus foreshadowing the surrealistic and allegorical conclusion.-Keeping the original concept as intact as possible.  McGoohan wanted only seven episodes, but was required to do seventeen.  A&amp;E groups five of the seven ""essentials"" together, at the beginning, in McGoohan's prescribed order.  All ten additional episodes are inserted before the two that must conclude the series.""Checkmate"" is now one of the early episodes because of a reference to No. 6 being new.  It also gives us our first look at the kind of ""treatment"" one gets in the hospital.  I suspect ""Checkmate"" was originally postponed to save the large-scale escape attempt for later, but I feel it shows that No. 6 still had a lesson to learn.  He'd progressed beyond the half-baked escape attempt in ""Free for All,"" but still hadn't learned how few people he could trust.  Although I felt the specific reason for his plan's failure was a bit predictable, I also found it interesting in light of how one of the BIG QUESTIONS would ultimately be answered in the final episode.  A&amp;E corrects a technical blooper found in the MPI release.  ""Checkmate"" is an episode where the actor who will play No. 2 also performs the introductory dialog.  But in the MPI release, the first few lines are done with that ""generic"" No. 2 (Robert Rietty) before switching to the correct voice -- with a rather obvious splice.""Chimes of Big Ben"" has been moved from second* to fifth -- which makes perfect sense to me.  Yes, it also makes sense to put one of the more straightforward episodes at the beginning, but, as A&amp;E points out, ""Chimes"" takes place over several months and establishes that No. 6 has been missing for several months, so it cannot precede the three episodes that call No. 6 ""new.""  Furthermore, No. 6 has completed his transition from defensive to offensive tactics, and knows his way around The Village, as evidenced by his taking charge with Nadia.  Two details that stood out for me were (1) his giving Nadia the nonalcoholic liquor spiel we saw him getting in ""Free for All,"" and (2) his telling Nadia that an attempt to escape by sea has already been tried -- presumably a reference to ""Checkmate.""  And it seems that No. 6 has learned his lesson from ""Checkmate.""  This time, he involves only Nadia in his escape attempt, because she's a new arrival and hasn't been infected by Village mentality -- or so he believes.  What I find interesting about the ending is that it combines victory and defeat.  No. 6 fails to escape, but thwarts a plan to trick him into revealing information.  The ending also suggest that his own people might be running The Village.And now for the nonessential episodes.  ""A. B. and C."" originally came early -- third* -- at least partly, I suspect, because it's both straightforward and upbeat.  No. 6 doesn't escape, but he does make fools of No. 2 and the lady doctor who's been enlisted to help force information out of him.  A&amp;E places this episode later because dangerous drugs wouldn't have been used on No. 6 until other methods had failed.  I agree with this reasoning, and would add two more points.  First, No. 6 appears to have taken as much command of his station as possible.  Second.  I prefer this episode as an antidote to ""Free for All,"" rather than a setup for the defeatism of that episode.  I also find No 2's terrified discourse with No. 1 on the red phone interesting now that I've seen the whole miniseries and thus know who No. 1 is.""The General"" is what I call a ""side trip"" episode.  Departing from the central conflict, it  concerns an instant university-level education that's really a scheme to brainwash most of the Village population  This episode introduces us to the gray-uniformed, white-helmeted goons we'll see in the final episode, as well as some of the equipment and underground corridors seen in that episode.This is one place where I would debate A&amp;E's order.  Yes, ""General"" must come after ""A. B. and C."" because it features the same No. 2, who states the ""No. 6 and I are old friends.""  But should it come IMMEDIATELY afterward?  A&amp;E theorizes that No. 1 said, ""Okay, you get one more chance,""  but he could have just as easily said ""You're fired,"" then later, ""I'm calling you back in,"" as implied by the original order*.  A&amp;E also claims ""General"" must precede ""Schizoid Man,""because the No. 12 in ""General"" has been there ""a long time,"" and so can't logically appear after the recently-arrived No. 12 in ""Schizoid Man.""  This makes it wrong to put ""General"" IMMEDIATELY after ""Schizoid Man,"" but the insertion of several episodes in between would solve the plausibility problem.The bonus material in this set is limited, but that's not a major problem, considering it includes four episodes.  I do wish, however, that the alternate version of ""Chimes of Big Ben"" had been put here instead of in set 1.*In both the U.K. and U.S.",5,The chimes ring a little truer this way.,1075939200,"02 5,

558470,AFMWLT45X9H4R,B00004Y7E1,Jim Toms,"[2, 2]","Of the 17 episodes produced for the show, near midpoint there seems to be a slight shift in No. 6's plan from one of outright escape to making things miserable for No. 2. However, with the possible exception of ""The General"", escape is still uppermost in No. 6's mind in the episodes of Set 2.In ""Checkmate"", No. 6 witnesses the manipulation of a human pawn in a giant, outdoor chess game. No. 6 attempts to determine who is a true ""villager"" like himself and who is a planted guard on the island. Through the relationship with the pawn, No. 6 thinks he's found himself an ally in escape.  But has he?""The Chimes of Big Ben"", arguably one of the best of the series, allows No. 6 to meet a beautiful woman prisoner who has already been foiled by Rover (you know, that giant bubble thing). No. 6 agrees to help No. 8 escape and he does so by entering in a village sponsored arts and crafts exhibition. This is fun to watch. Be sure to pay close attention as it all unfolds at the end and No. 6 realizes some crucial details he had overlooked before.A great episode, ""A, B, and C"", has No. 2, played well by Colin Gordon, using drugs to get at No. 2's past. Hardly possible in real life but definitely fun and intriguing on the screen.Finally, ""The General"" is the weakest of these four episodes but it should be said that there's no such thing as a bad episode from this show. No. 2 has decided that mind control through something called ""speed learn"" and operated by a giant computer called ""The General"" will eventually cause No. 6 to reveal that information that they so desperately want (""Why did you resign?!"").

558471,A3D822N1K2IAQD,B00004Y7E1,Kenneth Stuart,"[5, 5]","&quot;The Prisoner&quot; is one of the handful of all-time great television series (one of the others - &quot;I, Claudius&quot; - is also now on DVD).After seeing the series originally on a 9-inch B&amp;W TV and then later on a very snowy UHF PBS channel, it's great to see it now in DVD quality.Unlike one of the other reviewers, I find this particular set to be possibly the best of the lot (although certainly Set One is the best starting point).The episode &quot;A, B, and C&quot; has many levels, and is an excellent spy story, an outstanding &quot;dream&quot; story, and would be appreciated by fans of Dr. Who, Forbidden Planet or the Twilight Zone, as well.  Amongst the other colorful elements is a posh 1960s party for the upper crust of society.While not wanting to reveal any spoilers, I can say that the scene where Number Two and his accomplice both turn to look at the door is one of the great moments in TV drama.Enjoy!",5,"&quot;A, B, and C&quot; is one of the most brilliant episodes of TV",988070400,"04 24, 2001",2001,935,"['quot', 'Prisoner', 'quot', 'one', 'handful', 'all-time', 'great', 'television', 'series', 'one', 'others', 'quot', 'Claudius', 'quot', 'also', 'now', 'DVD', '.After', 'seeing', 'series', 'originally', '9-inch', 'B', 'amp', 'W', 'TV', 'then', 'later', 'very', 'snowy', 'UHF', 'PBS', 'channel', 'great', 'see', 'now', 'DVD', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'find', 'particular', 'set', 'be', 'possibly', 'best', 'lot', 'certainly', 'Set', 'One', 'best', 'starting', 'point', '.The', 'episode', 'quot', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'quot', 'many', 'levels', 'excellent', 'spy', 'story', 'outstanding', 'quot', 'dream', 'quot', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'appreciated', 'fans', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'as', 'well', 'Amongst', 'other', 'colorful', 'elements', 'posh', '1960s', 'party', 'upper', 'crust', 'society.While', 'not', 'wanting', 'reveal', 'spoilers', 'can', 'say', 'scene', 'where', 'Number', 'Two', 'accomplice', 'turn', 'look', 'door', 'one', 'great', 'moments', 'TV', 'drama.Enjoy']","The Prisoner - Set 2: Checkmate/ The Chimes of Big Ben/ A, B and C/ The General"

558473,A3ADJVRAPJC6KZ,B00004Y7E1,Michael Meunier,"[2, 2]","This set of episodes 4-7 from The Prisoner (as A & E sequences it) contain what I feel are three of the best entries in the series and they can each stand viewing on their own.Checkmate is a memorable story because of the human chessboard introduced at its beginning and for the daring, exciting escape attempt which follows as Number 6 learns to tell the difference between the whites and the blacks.The Chimes Of Big Ben is many viewer's choice for the best episode in the entire series. Leo McKern is an excellent foil for McGoohan, and the story is as funny as it is exhilarating.A, B,and C, is a fun piece with a really dark edge as Number 6 discovers, to his horror, that somebody has been messing with him while he sleeps!The General (which I believe goes BEFORE A, B, and C), has a repeat Number 2 whose performance reminds me of my elementary school principal &#60;shivers&#62;. Anyhow, I found the resolution of this tale very sloppy and forced but, for its time, the notion of Number 6's question was still kinda fresh to philosophy courses, I suppose. It's just a little dated on that score and it may be my least favorite episode. Then again, I absolutely love Number 6's disguise, infiltration, and plot. And it does firmly establish that Number 6 is now on the offensive against the Village.So, I see nothing wrong if this is the only set you want to get. It's got four solid episodes (as opposed to other sets with only three), the first two being classics of the series. The bonus material isn't very filling, and you'd think A & E could've put all four stories on one disc but, hey, why sell em' one disc when you can sell em' two, eh?- Be seeing you!",5,From His First Solid Escape Attempt To His First Victory...,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,1669,"['set', 'episodes', '4-7', 'Prisoner', 'A', 'E', 'contain', 'what', 'feel', 'are', 'three', 'best', 'entries', 'series', 'can', 'stand', 'viewing', 'own.Checkmate', 'memorable', 'story', 'human', 'chessboard', 'introduced', 'beginning', 'daring', 'exciting', 'escape', 'attempt', 'Number', '6', 'learns', 'tell', 'difference', 'whites', 'blacks.The', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'many', 'viewer', 'choice', 'best', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'excellent', 'foil', 'McGoohan', 'story', 'as', 'funny', 'exhilarating.A', 'B', 'C', 'fun', 'piece', 'really', 'dark', 'edge', 'Number', '6', 'discovers', 'horror', 'somebody', 'been', 'messing', 'General', 'believe', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'repeat', 'Number', '2', 'performance', 'elementary', 'school', 'principal', '60', 'shivers', '62', 'Anyhow', 'found', 'resolution', 'tale', 'very', 'sloppy', 'forced', 'time', 'notion', 'Number', '6', 'question', 'was', 'still', 'kinda', 'fresh', 'philosophy', 'courses', 'suppose', 'just', 'little', 'dated', 'score', 'may', 'be', 'least', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Then', 'again', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Number', '6', 'disguise', 'infiltration', 'plot', 'firmly', 'establish', 'Number', '6', 'now', 'offensive', 'Village.So', 'see', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'only', 'set', 'want', 'get', 'got', 'four', 'solid', 'episodes', 'opposed', 'other', 'sets', 'only', 'three', 'first', 'two', 'being', 'classics', 'series', 'bonus', 'material', ""n't"", 'very', 'filling', ""'d"", 'think', 'A', 'E', 'could', ""'ve"", 'put', 'four', 'stories', 'one', 'disc', 'hey', 'why', 'sell', 'em', 'one', 'disc', 'when', 'can', 'sell', 'em', 'two', 'eh', 'Be', 'seeing']","The Prisoner - Set 2: Checkmate/ The Chimes of Big Ben/ A, B and C/ The General"

558475,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00004Y7E1,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[1, 1]","Movie Summary:  Four more exciting episodes find our hero British Secret Agent number 6 playing the part of a pawn in Checkmate, hatching an escape plan in The Chimes of Big Ben, fighting the dream police in A, B, and C, and dealing with speed learning in The General. Number 2 still wants information and by hook and by crook he keeps trying to get it. There is still only one problem; Number 6 isn't talking.My Opinion:  I enjoyed this second set even more than the first. Hence the upgrade to 5 stars. It's very intelligent and ahead of its time. They use cordless phones and other technology that is very advanced for the 1960's. The plots are very well developed and involved. Number 6 is a very likeable main character. It's very easy to root for him. The first seven episodes seem to be pretty much independent of order. The stories don't run from one to the other like they do in some of the current one hour dramas. There could still be some subtle story threads that I haven't picked up yet. I am very excited to get the third set and continue watching them. Hopefully they will just keep getting better! Be seeing you at the reviews for the third set.DVD Quality:  Full Screen Dolby 2.0 Mono. This is a two disc set containing the next four episodes of the series. Extras include trailers, trivia, stills, and an interactive map.What You Should Do:  Rent it if you've never seen it. At this point I still can't recommend buying all five sets, but I am leaning more that way. What I have seen is extremely enjoyable but things could still go wrong although I'm starting to doubt that they will.Related Movies To Check Out:  Quantum Leap, Space 1999, The X Files",5,By Hook Or By Crook I Will Have More Episodes!,995932800,"07 24, 2001",2001,1671,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Four', 'more', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'find', 'hero', 'British', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'number', '6', 'playing', 'part', 'pawn', 'Checkmate', 'hatching', 'escape', 'plan', 'Chimes', 'Big', 'Ben', 'fighting', 'dream', 'police', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'dealing', 'speed', 'learning', 'General', 'Number', '2', 'still', 'information', 'hook', 'crook', 'trying', 'get', 'still', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'Number', '6', ""n't"", 'talking.My', 'Opinion', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'set', 'even', 'more', 'first', 'Hence', 'upgrade', '5', 'stars', 'very', 'intelligent', 'ahead', 'time', 'use', 'cordless', 'phones', 'other', 'technology', 'very', 'advanced', '1960', 'plots', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'involved', 'Number', '6', 'very', 'likeable', 'main', 'character', 'very', 'easy', 'root', 'first', 'seven', 'episodes', 'seem', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'independent', 'order', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'one', 'other', 'do', 'current', 'one', 'hour', 'dramas', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'subtle', 'story', 'threads', 'have', ""n't"", 'picked', 'up', 'yet', 'am', 'very', 'excited', 'get', 'third', 'set', 'continue', 'watching', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'just', 'keep', 'getting', 'better', 'Be', 'seeing', 'reviews', 'third', 'set.DVD', 'Quality', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'Mono', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'containing', 'next', 'four', 'episodes', 'series', 'Extras', 'include', 'trailers', 'trivia', 'stills', 'interactive', 'map.What', 'Should', 'Do', 'Rent', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'point', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'five', 'sets', 'am', 'leaning', 'more', 'way', 'What', 'have', 'seen', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'things', 'could', 'still', 'go', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'starting', 'doubt', 'will.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Space', '1999', 'X', 'Files']","The Prisoner - Set 2: Checkmate/ The Chimes of Big Ben/ A, B and C/ The General"
