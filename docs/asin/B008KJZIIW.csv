1569362,A2PJYTDF5FRMAK,B008KJZIIW,B.M.,"[7, 8]","This movie could have been wonderful if it would have tied off loose ends. Add an extra ten minutes to the movie and show a resolve to the issues please! Well, too late, this movie is an hour and about 50 minutes and does not end with a very great tie over. Why?#1- Did the son ever forgive the father? it doesn't show#2- Did the father ever drop his girlfriend, or did she drop him?#3- Did the young asian boy ever stand up and get away from the bully that always wanted to compete with the main character?#4- Did the main character ever get accepted into college, as was his mother's wish?#5- Did the boy ever get the skating scholarship that kept being brought up?#6- Did the homeless man ever forgive himself and start picking up the pieces of his life again?These are some of the main things that were acted out in the movie, but no sufficient ending to tie up the loose ends. I am sorry, i have to give it a two for that reason. And more reasonable sites like Netflix, and Imdb actually give it a two out of five due to poor execution.Not to mention, you have to modulate the sound the whole movie. Unless you like loud rock music, it is too loud when the background music (not really back ground) comes on, and then too low when the vocals of the actors in the movie come in....",2,"Good Plot, Bad Ending",1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,1285,"['movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'would', 'have', 'tied', 'off', 'loose', 'ends', 'Add', 'extra', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'show', 'resolve', 'issues', 'please', 'Well', 'too', 'late', 'movie', 'hour', '50', 'minutes', 'not', 'end', 'very', 'great', 'tie', 'Why', '1-', 'Did', 'son', 'ever', 'forgive', 'father', ""n't"", 'show', '2-', 'Did', 'father', 'ever', 'drop', 'girlfriend', 'did', 'drop', '3-', 'Did', 'young', 'asian', 'boy', 'ever', 'stand', 'up', 'get', 'away', 'bully', 'always', 'wanted', 'compete', 'main', 'character', '4-', 'Did', 'main', 'character', 'ever', 'get', 'accepted', 'college', 'was', 'mother', 'wish', '5-', 'Did', 'boy', 'ever', 'get', 'skating', 'scholarship', 'kept', 'being', 'brought', 'up', '6-', 'Did', 'homeless', 'man', 'ever', 'forgive', 'start', 'picking', 'up', 'pieces', 'life', 'again', 'are', 'main', 'things', 'were', 'acted', 'out', 'movie', 'sufficient', 'ending', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'am', 'sorry', 'i', 'have', 'give', 'two', 'reason', 'more', 'reasonable', 'sites', 'Netflix', 'Imdb', 'actually', 'give', 'two', 'five', 'due', 'poor', 'execution.Not', 'mention', 'have', 'modulate', 'sound', 'whole', 'movie', 'like', 'loud', 'rock', 'music', 'too', 'loud', 'when', 'background', 'music', 'not', 'really', 'back', 'ground', 'then', 'too', 'low', 'when', 'vocals', 'actors', 'movie', 'come']",N/A

1569365,A32U6577WUD9L5,B008KJZIIW,"Donald James. Parker ""Author""","[5, 5]","If you're into the skateboarding scene, you might be in for a treat here. Or you might be in for a laugh fest, if the movie failed to portray the world of skateboards realistically. Since I grew up in the era of roller skates, the ones with the keys to tighten the skates down over the shoes, I have no knowledge of boarding and I'll just give the benefit of the doubt to the director/writers here. John Schneider, who seems to be getting typecast as a father figure for hurting young people does his usual stellar job. Randy Wayne is excellent as the troubled, but very likeable, skateboarder. Baby faced Wayne is still playing kid's roles even though he will turn 32 this year. The conflict in this film was fairly intense, keeping the viewer's interest, even for non-skateboarding fans to see this through to the climax. My main issue, which prevented me from assigning five stars, is that the message of Christianity was a bit watered down, potentially leading some to believe all we have to do is ride a skateboard that has the name or picture of Jesus on it and our ride through life will be a victorious one. All this movie needed to earn that fifth star was a hint of a follow up conversation that would take place after the competition where the message that Jesus asked us to take up our crosses, not our skateboards, would be shared with the boy.",4,Great for skateboarding fanatics.
