There's no doubt that it's extremely well made, well written and well acted.  But I wonder if there are viewers out there who actually like any of these characters.  My first thought was about Brenda, who isn't exactly a bad person but doesn't have much in the way of redeeming qualities.  As the series unfolded I began to feel the same way about each of the main characters in turn.  What's interesting is that the dad, who everyone blames for their problems, doesn't seem to be the reason at all--it's the rest of them who are effed up and completely self-involved.  If anyone ever talked to me the way they talk to each other, I would be out the door in a heartbeat.  Of course, there are people in the world like this--I've known many--who are pointedly malicious to each other, and they all take it and spew it out over and over again.  It used to be that every story, any story, had to create some kind of empathy for its characters.  Even if they were mean, rotten people, there had to be something we could relate to, some grain of humanity we could latch onto, even if we hated them.  In essence, we had to care about them on some level for the story to work.  Amazingly, though, the end of the 20th century saw the overturning of this age-old rule and began to create stories in which we feel nothing for the characters and could care less what happens to them but still somehow engages us.  Six Feet Under didn't start out that way for me, but after season two I find that it has carried on this newly-created tradition, and still I want to watch it.",4,Love the show/hate the people,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,1626,"['more', 'watch', 'show', 'less', 'care', 'people', 'doubt', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'wonder', 'are', 'viewers', 'who', 'actually', 'characters', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'Brenda', 'who', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'bad', 'person', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'way', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'series', 'unfolded', 'began', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'main', 'characters', 'turn', 'What', 'interesting', 'dad', 'who', 'everyone', 'blames', 'problems', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'reason', 'rest', 'who', 'are', 'effed', 'up', 'completely', 'self-involved', 'anyone', 'ever', 'talked', 'way', 'talk', 'other', 'would', 'be', 'out', 'door', 'heartbeat', 'course', 'are', 'people', 'world', ""'ve"", 'known', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'pointedly', 'malicious', 'other', 'take', 'spew', 'out', 'over', 'again', 'used', 'be', 'story', 'story', 'had', 'create', 'kind', 'empathy', 'characters', 'Even', 'were', 'mean', 'rotten', 'people', 'had', 'be', 'something', 'could', 'relate', 'grain', 'humanity', 'could', 'latch', 'even', 'hated', 'essence', 'had', 'care', 'level', 'story', 'work', 'Amazingly', 'end', '20th', 'century', 'saw', 'overturning', 'age-old', 'rule', 'began', 'create', 'stories', 'feel', 'nothing', 'characters', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'what', 'still', 'somehow', 'Six', 'Feet', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'out', 'way', 'season', 'two', 'find', 'carried', 'newly-created', 'tradition', 'still', 'want', 'watch']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Second Season

808962,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B0001KL5DA,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[14, 15]","Like many viewers, I don't get HBO, so I got hooked watching Season 1's episodes all at once, on video. The DVD presentation adds commentaries of mixed quality. Writer Jill Solowey opens by wondering why anyone would spend an hour listening to her talk. &quot;You must not have a life if you're here,&quot; she says. Unnecessarily demeaning to viewers, as commentaries add a whole layer of enjoyment to the viewing experience.Other commentators pointed out the old-fashioned Addams family quality of the Fishers, which I hadn't noticed -- but now I see they have an avocado-colored refrigerator! And I see the contrast between the timeless, stifling ambience of the funeral home and the free-spirited world that the family encounters outside.Season 2's writers faced a major challenge because plots need conflict and at least two sources of conflict have disappeared. Nate has now firmly committed to being a funeral director -- he gets his license early in the season -- and he's firmly allied with his brother's interests. And David, now officially out as a gay man, has a choice of nice dates before ending up (as we always suspected) with the charismatic Keith.The Christmas episode was my favorite, although it was more satisfying than suspenseful. A group of Harley Davidson riders gathers to honor a fallen comrade, while the Fishers remember their last moments with their father. The biker funeral was a treat. I'd like my own funeral to be a big party too, although I hope my heirs have the sense to demand a cheap cremation rather than a ten thousand dollar box.As other reviewers have noted, Nate takes the lead this season, possibly because his character seems least controversial and most sympathetic. He's grown into a compassionate, caring person, even befriending a young man dying friendless with pancreatic cancer. Pushing the cremation button seems an odd but sincere act of friendship.At the same time, I found it hard to like either of Nate's girlfriends -- the neurotic Brenda and the needy, vulnerable Lisa. Nate deserves someone he can respect.And I disagree with those who call this family &quot;dysfunctional&quot; and &quot;repressed.&quot; While the rabbi in Season 2 preaches the importance of total honesty, in fact research shows that marriages often stay together more by what's not said than by openness.Compared to most families, the Fishers are not bad! Rememer they see each other every day and support one another through tough times. And they do show mutual respect. Ruth may be controlling but she gives her children a lot of space. She even seems a little intimidated by Claire, who was born after the boys were almost grown.The commentators suggest that the show goes to great lengths for realism. However, in a contemporary police department, Keith would not be on duty while under investigation for killing a citizen. He'd turn over his gun and badge and be off duty with pay. He would also be required -- not advised, required -- to see the police psychologist. These steps probably would have prevented the next tragedy, where Keith lashes out during a domestic violence call.Seasons 3 to 5 are out, I hear, so we know Nate will recover and go on to more adventures.

To get all of this entertainment free was worth the cost of my Amazon Prime membership. Now, on to the show...I was riveted to every episode with a stunned wonder at what goes on behind the scenes of a family-owned mortuary business. Second to that were the engaging characters and sometimes rather depressing life stories that were so compelling that it didn't put me off the show. This would have been less of a great show if not for the ghosts of the deceased appearing here and there to lend their wisdom and gallows humor to coping with their deaths and bringing understanding and closure for the ones who remained behind.No spoilers here, and not naming names, but a percentage of the main characters get killed off, esp toward the last season. My favorite character was Claire. She could have carried the whole show on her back. Nate and David, too. The acting and scripts were first-rate and nothing in my life could have ever predicted that a show about a mortuary-owning family would become iconic and one of my favorite series of all time.I cried buckets during the series finale. Get the Kleenex ready!Ugh, I can't even tell you how much I miss this ensemble cast. I thought of them in my real life many times at odd moments, as they became almost like real people I knew and cared about. The series was a stunning tour de force and now I follow the careers of those fine actors and writers to see what they are up to on their newer shows.Farewell, ensemble cast of Six Feet Under.

Getting to argue with female viewers about whether the mother is a sympathetic or an unsympathetic figure.  (Don't know which?  hint:  she's both, and that makes her human.)3.  Watching the narcissistic little sister become more mature.4.  Moving the gay brother away from stereotype and into greater human balance.5.  Seeing the prodigal son kind of resolve his relationship issues and decide to give himself, selflessly, to a dying man.6.

Here are my reasons. Six Feet Under has deep rich and profound characters who you really care about and have everyday life crises to deal with that we can all relate to. How many people are mobsters??Second there are strong rich female characters in this series that drive the drama and they get a good amount of screen time, not the less than 17% that Geena Davis's research institute has proven for women and girls across the board for the majority of media including feature film, TV series and animation. Isn't a little over 50% of the world population women and girls -so why do we accept depictions of males as more interesting? Writers, directors and producers need to do better and be more creative with their characters, this show shows that it is possible to have great female characters as rich and entertaining as any of their male counterparts, and they do not have to kill or be murdered by a mobster to achieve that.Thirdly we are all going to die and this show profoundly explores that reality in every episode touching on all classes, situations, ages, race and gender. It is not just about knocking people off or gratuitous violence even though some of these deaths do occur violently. Six Feet Under explores death and grieving as well as the difficult aspects of burying a loved one again a complex and human way that we can all relate to.I enjoyed every season of this series and final episode is by far one of the best HBO written/produced episodes of any series they have ever done. Kudos to Alan Ball he knows how to write for all types of characters including great gay characters and real believable relationships too, David and Keith are one of the best male couples depicted in a main stream series, and Claire's dabble with sexuality was also completely believable and well written.

808991,AYYODBGYFL5SY,B0001KL5DA,N. Wong,"[5, 7]","The second season, honestly speaking, is not as fascinating as the first one. Yet, it still outstands lots of other dramas. The first season strikes many of us because of its style and the captivating characterisation. Each character is so distinguished from each other and each has his/her own charm. Once we are used to this formula, season 2 seems to offer less surprise to the audience. However, what season 2 does is to complicate the plot and the closure of each problem still brings joy to many of us.The most brilliant part is season 2 is the adding of Taylor, Keith's niece into the drama. She evolves around David and Keith, sharing the homosexual secrets from the child's point of view. It's very interesting and the chemistry IS there. However, what disappoints me most, personally, is the pitification of Ruth, the mother in many episodes. Season 2 tends to victimize Ruth as a mother who shares one-way communication to her Russian lover, Nikolai, and the communication problem worsens between her and her children. Each episode tends to amplify this theme of victimhood and even in epsiode 13, her strong will is not restored completely. The whole season ends with a scene in which Claire and David hug their mother for love and concern when Nate is undergoing an AVM surgery.Season 2 also brings more emphasis on the sidecast of the drama. Rico and his wife, Brenda's parents or even Brenda's new prostitute friend do stir a certain storm in the character's life. The second season extends the problems plotted in the first season - Keith and David's crisis, Nate's health problem, Brenda's obsession with wild sex, Ruth's incompetence and helplessness and Claire's cynicism. All these themes are touched in season 2.Everybody who loves the first 2 seasons is waiting desperately for Season 3 on DVD.

808992,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B0001KL5DA,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[2, 2]","In its second season, Six Feet Under continues to brilliantly build on what was established in the first season.  There were many stand-out episodes, particularly in the earlier portion of the season, and the directions each of the characters were taken is very interesting.  Federico, a character I found myself disliking during Season One, was developed quite a bit more.  Keith, on the other hand, showed an uglier side of himself that added some great drama into his relationship with David, which is one of the main plot lines of this season.Come to think of it, each of the character arcs were risky in this season, and most of them paid off.  I'm not left with that ""I need to know what happens next"" as I was with the last season, but what I am is excited to see how these stories will continue.  The use of music and the direction continues to be phenomenal and I'm willing to bet that at least nine of these episodes will make you cry, and that all of them will make you laugh.  The plots jump around from Nathan/Brenda's relationship, to David/Keith's drama, to Ruth's situation with herself and Nikolai, to Claire's budding interest in the arts, and many more, but you'll never find yourself swamped by 'too many things going on at once.'  Each episode is planned well, leaving you feeling sad when the show ends with a white-out and the credits begin to roll.I usually don't talk much about Special Features when reviewing a DVD unless the extras are really horrible or are outstanding, but I have to comment on Alan Ball's commentary track for ""The Last Time.""  While Ball is, in my opinion, one of the best writer/directors out there, this commentary track is a joke.  It consists of him saying ""this is a good scene because ___ did a good job"" and then just letting the scene play without further comment.  The only thing other than the occasional talk of camera work (all of that is in the first five minutes) is him laughing at one of the jokes every now and then.  Why even bother putting a commentary track if you aren't going to comment on the work?But--special features aside--the second season of this brilliant show is absolutely a must-have.  I'm not quite sure whether or not it's better or as good than the first season, but fans of the first won't be disappointed.9/10",5,Continued Brilliance,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,2296,"['second', 'season', 'Six', 'Feet', 'brilliantly', 'build', 'was', 'established', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'many', 'stand-out', 'episodes', 'particularly', 'earlier', 'portion', 'season', 'directions', 'characters', 'were', 'taken', 'very', 'interesting', 'Federico', 'character', 'found', 'disliking', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'developed', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'Keith', 'other', 'hand', 'showed', 'uglier', 'side', 'added', 'great', 'drama', 'relationship', 'David', 'one', 'main', 'plot', 'lines', 'season.Come', 'think', 'character', 'arcs', 'were', 'risky', 'season', 'most', 'paid', 'off', ""'m"", 'not', 'left', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'what', 'am', 'excited', 'see', 'how', 'stories', 'will', 'continue', 'use', 'music', 'direction', 'be', 'phenomenal', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'least', 'nine', 'episodes', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'plots', 'jump', 'Nathan/Brenda', 'relationship', 'David/Keith', 'drama', 'Ruth', 'situation', 'Nikolai', 'Claire', 'budding', 'interest', 'arts', 'many', 'more', ""'ll"", 'never', 'find', 'swamped', ""'too"", 'many', 'things', 'going', 'once', 'episode', 'planned', 'well', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'sad', 'when', 'show', 'white-out', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll.I', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'much', 'Special', 'Features', 'when', 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'really', 'horrible', 'are', 'outstanding', 'have', 'comment', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'commentary', 'track', 'Last', 'Time', 'Ball', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'writer/directors', 'out', 'there', 'commentary', 'track', 'joke', 'saying', 'good', 'scene', '___', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'then', 'just', 'letting', 'scene', 'play', 'further', 'comment', 'only', 'thing', 'other', 'occasional', 'talk', 'camera', 'work', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'laughing', 'one', 'jokes', 'now', 'then', 'Why', 'even', 'bother', 'putting', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'comment', 'work', 'special', 'features', 'aside', 'second', 'season', 'brilliant', 'show', 'absolutely', 'must-have', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'not', 'better', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'fans', 'first', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.9/10']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Second Season

808995,AEGQWVR6KWBV,B0001KL5DA,"Ron Cronovich ""Ron""","[56, 58]","If you haven't seen Season One, stop reading this right now and go watch it.  You're in for a real treat, as 6FU is one of the most well-written TV dramas ever.If you watched Season Two when it originally aired and are considering purchasing this set, you should know that the DVD extras are not plentiful.  Several of the 13 episodes have optional commentaries you can listen to while you're watching the episode; I find this is a big investment of time for a small payoff, but that's just me.  Plus, the last disc contains a short documentary ""anatomy of a stiff,"" which is worth watching once, but not really that compelling.  Another factor that might affect your purchase decision is that the episodes themselves are rich and stand up to repeated viewings, unlike most of the tripe on television.  Plus, watching the episodes on DVD - on YOUR schedule - makes for a much better experience than waiting a week or more between episodes as they are aired on HBO.If you've seen Season One but not Season Two yet, the best indicator of whether you'll like Two is how much you liked One.  Yes, it's true, fans disagree over which of the first two seasons was better.  But the overwhelming majority that liked One a lot also liked Two a lot.I think both of the first two seasons were EXCELLENT, but a bit different.  Almost every episode of the first season was very good or excellent.  The second season had the same average quality as the first season, but more variability - that is, a few episodes or storylines were a bit weaker than what we typically saw in Season One, but other episodes and storylines were even better than those in Season One.  The last two episodes of Season Two rank among the best television I've ever seen.I will try to set up the events of Season Two without giving anything away.  At the end of Season One, Nate was coming to grips with a newly diagnosed brain condition that could cause seizures, or even a stroke and death.  Nate and Brenda had declared their love for each other, despite a fairly complicated and sometimes rocky relationship.  David was single and struggling in his love life, and coming to terms with being ""out.""  He and Keith were still friends, and it was clear that they still had feelings for each other.  These storylines are developed further in Season Two, with many interesting twists and turns along the way.  Of course, there are also storylines involving Ruth and Claire.  Ruth's growth in Season Two is nonlinear - she seems to make progress in one episode, but then reverts back to her depressed, repressed, controlling self in the next.  Claire has interesting relationships with different people, each of which shapes her in some way, good or bad, and she gets a bit of direction in her life toward the end of Season Two.One of the things that makes 6FU so great is that it's so real.  The characters are 3-dimensional, flawed, and (mostly) likeable.  Whenever I watch the show after not having seen it for a month or more, it's like getting together again with old friends.  I also respect the show for taking seriously the issues of religion and minority sexual orientation (Amazon.com has previously censored me for using the word that begins with ""h"").

I loved this show to death-the characters were so rich and fulfilling and colorful and likeable, and the season finale was gripping. When we last left the show, Nate discovered that he had AVM, a brain condition, David came out of the closet, Brenda decided to institutionalize her brother and other half of her life, Billy, Claire's bad-boy boyfriend, Gabriel, robbed a store, and Ruth started a sexual affair with Nokolai, her boss. Now, as we enter the second season, it starts off with a bang, then getts dull, then ends with a big bang. In my opinion, it started off really well for the first four episodes, then it got really dull and tedious, then the last two episodes were amazing. In this season, Nate begins to rethink his life with AVM, Gabriel digs himself further to his grave and takes Claire down with him (God I miss that guy), Ruth begins to get overzealous of her relationship (and go with The Plan), and David ponders his life without Keith. And oh that Brenda. Now, with Billy out of her life, she takes on a hobby-writing a novel. And oh, yeah-cheating on Nate. She used to be really likeable and real in her insecurities (...). And the same goes to Keith-he's getting too confusing and and tough for David. And here's another complaint-too many unnecessary subplots, such as Keith's neice, Taylor-as much as I like her, STAY OUT OF THE FISHER FAMILY! One bright spot is the wonderful Patricia Clarkson as Ruths' bohemian, Joni-Mitchell-playing sister, Sara. She looks like she has a blast playing it. And kudos to the amazing Lili Taylor for playing Lisa, an old friend of Nate's. And just as I thought that I was done with it, it reeled me back in-and I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the third season.

808997,A2STAUT07F8VRR,B0001KL5DA,Scout1980,"[3, 5]","It seems somehow fitting that, for a show whose central setting is a funeral home, the characters and storylines within it are brought more vividly to life than in most television dramas. ""Six Feet Under"" focuses on brothers Nate and David, running their family funeral business under the paranoid eye of their mother, Ruth. I wouldn't want to go into too much detail here about the various plotlines, but I watched the entire second season on DVD in almost one sitting--and it was thoroughly satisfying. I like how each episode begins with one random sequence of events, with the end result someone dying in an unexpected (or sometimes expected) way. At the end of that first scene, the name and years the person lived appears on the screen on a white background. That person's death is worked into the episode, as Nate and David have to handle the funeral for Fisher and Sons.The acting is also great all around and the direction and cinematography are of film quality, which is not suprising, considering that Alan Ball (American Beauty) created the series and wrote and directed a number of episodes.

I have watched the show for three years, beginning with the first season in 2003, a year after my arrival in the US, and purchasing the DVD set of each following season upon their release. I am completely with another reviewer who said that she would sell crack on street if it means limitless SFU. For the last three years, SFU has been a fail-proof anti-depressant for me. Although some see it as deeply depressing, and I agree with them, that very depressing quality always eased my own depression and pain, and strangely enough, made me feel more calm, peaceful, clear, and focused. More than that, it let me see that certain profound yet non-religious spirituality is possible in American pop culture and Americans themselves (one of the misconceptions non-Americans, like me, have about American culture is that, amid the ascendency of fundamentalist Christianity, it is essentially shallow and materialistic, or that it may be characterized as having what Shakespeare called ""irreligious piety""?).I can go on and on about how much I learned from SFU, how great consolation I got from it. So, as a big fan of the show, I see every season as a gem on its own. However, if I am forced to pick my favorite season, I'd pick season 2. It is more relaxed and yet, strangely again, more intense than the first season. Relaxed because I now know what to expect for the Fisher family and their funeral home, and intense because, as one of the axes of the plot-the relationship between Nate and Brenda-unfolds, I see a painful yet true description of why it is so hard for two people to stay together. Also, compared to following three seasons, it contains more of its trade-mark dark humor.In the Special Feature of the final season, creator Alan Ball tells us that Peter Krause's performance of Nate breathed an ""amazing everyman quality"" into the character, and while portraying this ""everyman,"" that Nate was the one character with a stronger spiritual, (or mystical), bent. This makes perfect sense. Looking back, in the first episode of the Season 2, we see Nate jotting down what his father says in his dream, which turns out to be from Bhagavad Gita. The episode ends beautifully with Nate reading his notes to Brenda, which read: ""All that lives lives forever. Only the shell, the perishable, passes away. The spirit is without end, eternal, deathless."" Here is one of the earliest moments when the contrast between the mentalities of Brenda and Nate is made, a contrast which will be more dramatically depicted in the latter episodes of the final season.I spent a fortune (""fortune"" indeed, considering my miserable income as a graduate student) on the DVD sets of SFU. But it was money well spent, since every episode is infinitely re-watchable and leads us to think about issues that are important.",5,"the spirit is without end, eternal, deathless....",1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,2922,"['recently', 'finished', 'watching', 'final', 'season', 'SFU', 'having', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'right', 'release', 'last', 'month', 'have', 'watched', 'show', 'three', 'years', 'beginning', 'first', 'season', '2003', 'year', 'arrival', 'US', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'set', 'following', 'season', 'release', 'am', 'completely', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'would', 'sell', 'crack', 'street', 'limitless', 'SFU', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'SFU', 'been', 'fail-proof', 'anti-depressant', 'see', 'deeply', 'depressing', 'agree', 'very', 'depressing', 'quality', 'always', 'eased', 'own', 'depression', 'pain', 'strangely', 'enough', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'calm', 'peaceful', 'clear', 'focused', 'More', 'let', 'see', 'certain', 'profound', 'yet', 'non-religious', 'spirituality', 'possible', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'Americans', 'one', 'misconceptions', 'non-Americans', 'have', 'American', 'culture', 'ascendency', 'fundamentalist', 'Christianity', 'essentially', 'shallow', 'materialistic', 'may', 'be', 'characterized', 'having', 'what', 'Shakespeare', 'called', 'irreligious', 'piety', '.I', 'can', 'go', 'how', 'much', 'learned', 'SFU', 'how', 'great', 'consolation', 'got', 'So', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'see', 'season', 'gem', 'own', 'However', 'am', 'forced', 'pick', 'favorite', 'season', ""'d"", 'pick', 'season', '2', 'more', 'relaxed', 'yet', 'strangely', 'again', 'more', 'intense', 'first', 'season', 'Relaxed', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Fisher', 'family', 'funeral', 'home', 'intense', 'because', 'one', 'axes', 'plot-the', 'relationship', 'Nate', 'Brenda-unfolds', 'see', 'painful', 'yet', 'true', 'description', 'why', 'so', 'hard', 'two', 'people', 'stay', 'together', 'Also', 'compared', 'following', 'three', 'seasons', 'more', 'trade-mark', 'dark', 'humor.In', 'Special', 'Feature', 'final', 'season', 'creator', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'performance', 'Nate', 'breathed', 'amazing', 'everyman', 'quality', 'character', 'portraying', 'everyman', 'Nate', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'stronger', 'spiritual', 'mystical', 'bent', 'perfect', 'sense', 'Looking', 'back', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', '2', 'see', 'Nate', 'jotting', 'down', 'what', 'father', 'dream', 'out', 'be', 'Bhagavad', 'Gita', 'episode', 'beautifully', 'Nate', 'reading', 'notes', 'Brenda', 'read', 'forever', 'Only', 'shell', 'perishable', 'away', 'spirit', 'end', 'eternal', 'deathless', 'Here', 'one', 'earliest', 'moments', 'when', 'contrast', 'mentalities', 'Brenda', 'Nate', 'made', 'contrast', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'dramatically', 'depicted', 'latter', 'episodes', 'final', 'season.I', 'spent', 'fortune', 'fortune', 'indeed', 'considering', 'miserable', 'income', 'graduate', 'student', 'DVD', 'sets', 'SFU', 'was', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'episode', 'infinitely', 're-watchable', 'think', 'issues', 'are', 'important']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Second Season

Also noteworthy is Brenda's mildly schizophrenic parent Margaret (Joanna Cassidy).Complete in same black ""13"" numbers of episode as previous season, this DVD box set also features a 20-minute ""Anatomy of a Working Stiff"" behind-the-scenes production to take you six feet under closer to cloning the shell of dead people!",5,Another good HBO epic to consume,1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,2076,"['Read', 'Amazon', 'review', 'non-satalite', 'programmed', 'home', 'box', 'still', 'am', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'obliged', 'take', 'stellar', 'Sopranos', 'kiddo', 'BMOC', 'video', 'shop', 'simply', ""n't"", 'strike', 'very', 'promising', 'TV', 'soups', 'not', 'award', 'credits', 'not', 'packaging', 'artwork', 'not', 'appearance', 'casts', 'not', 'when', 'have', 'already', 'met', 'assumingly', 'offbeat', 'Fisher', 'brothers', 'HBO', 'first', 'season', 'family', 'friends', 'Personal', 'serious', 'hallucination', 'aside', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ridiculous', ""'re"", 'lying', 'bed', 'die', 'seven', 'days', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'box', 'sets', 'SOPRANOS', 'Season', 'Four', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'Season', 'Two', 'watch', 'latter', 'first', 'Tripping', 'further', 'winding', 'ever', 'delights', 'surprises', 'Season', 'One', 'season', 'grib', 'heartbeat', 'enthral', 'mind', 'simple', 'familiar', 'facts', 'man', 'suffering', 'contemporary', 'refination', 'living', 'episode', 'not', 'afraid', 'manifying', 'core', 'issue', 'characters', 'suggesting', 'look', 'upside', 'however', 'Turning', 'points', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'Nate', 'Krause', 'fate', 'bad', 'struck', 'surgery', 'rocky', 'coping', 'Brenda', 'Griffith', 'breaking', 'further', 'self-haunting', 'recovery', 'Ruth', 'Conroy', 'final', 'wakefulness', 'making', 'decision', 'end', 'clingy', 'affair', 'co-worker', 'Nikolai', 'David', 'Hall', 'Keith', 'Patrick', 'parenting', 'effort', 'more', 'mending', 'past', 'domestic', 'issue', 'latter', 'Federico', 'Diaz', 'by-chance', 'partnership', 'Fisher', 'Son', 'last', 'not', 'forgetting', 'Claire', 'Ambrose', 'artistic', 'coming', 'term', 'persistent', 'teenage', 'angst.Adding', 'little', 'sparks', 'season', 'are', 'pagan', 'earthy', 'Aunt', 'Sarah', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Nate', 'former', 'indifferent', 'live-in', 'Lisa', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Seattle', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'Brenda', 'mildly', 'schizophrenic', 'parent', 'Margaret', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', '.Complete', 'same', 'black', '13', 'numbers', 'episode', 'previous', 'season', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'also', '20-minute', 'Anatomy', 'Working', 'Stiff', 'behind-the-scenes', 'production', 'take', 'six', 'feet', 'closer', 'cloning', 'shell', 'dead', 'people']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Second Season
