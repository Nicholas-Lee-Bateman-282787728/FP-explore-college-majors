664362,A4RBWH5IMQBXZ,B00005LQ01,"Michael Andrews ""movie buff""","[0, 0]","&#34;Phat Beach&#34; is not a great movie....it'll never be on my list of all time favorite films, but it's also not a truly awful, awful one, either i guess; it depends on how you choose to approach it. It's one of those 90's teen comedies that you watch on a boring Friday or Saturday night when you're channel surfing, and you sit and have a laugh for an hour and a half, then keep it moving.Jermaine &#34;Huggy&#34; Hopkins stars as Benny, a rotund but well meaning teenager who dreams of being a writer and entering a poetry class. Brian Hooks plays Durrell, his scheming, sex crazed best friend. Durrell has an idea to sell cheap sunglasses at the beach and borrow Benny's father's cherished Mercedes convertible; Benny reluctantly goes along with him. The rest of the movie deals with their misadventures as soon as they both arrive at the beach: chasing the sexy bikini clad chicks (and there are many!), Durrell's dumb rivalry with a goofy white wannabe homeboy named Mikey Z, and then a volleyball tournament!Like I said, dont expect a very well made movie; at times, it looks so amateurish, the pacing is way off, most of the direction is a bit sloppy, most of the supporting &#34;actors&#34; look like they're posing in front of the camera instead of trying to create somewhat believable performances, etc. Yet theres some good chemistry between Hopkins and Hooks, and at times, Hooks almost pretty much steals the movie with his fast talking, manic portrayal of Durrell. Hopkins is likeable as the put upon Benny. However, the real attraction of the film is the large percentage of hot, sexy women in the film, especially Claudia Kaseem as Benny's dream girl, and Devin DeRay who has a cameo as a stripper....Mmmmmm!!! In any case, I like the occasional dumb movie too, as long as there's some entertainment value in it and &#34;Phat Beach&#34; qualifies, a bit. If you dont take it too seriously and can enjoy it for what it is, you'll like it.",3,"Not a great movie, but a slight guilty pleasure.",1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,1958,"['34', 'Phat', 'Beach', '34', 'not', 'great', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'list', 'time', 'favorite', 'films', 'also', 'not', 'truly', 'awful', 'awful', 'one', 'i', 'guess', 'how', 'choose', 'approach', 'one', '90', 'teen', 'comedies', 'watch', 'boring', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'night', 'when', ""'re"", 'channel', 'surfing', 'sit', 'have', 'laugh', 'hour', 'half', 'then', 'keep', 'moving.Jermaine', '34', 'Huggy', '34', 'Hopkins', 'Benny', 'rotund', 'well', 'meaning', 'teenager', 'who', 'being', 'writer', 'entering', 'poetry', 'class', 'Brian', 'Hooks', 'plays', 'Durrell', 'scheming', 'sex', 'crazed', 'best', 'friend', 'Durrell', 'idea', 'sell', 'cheap', 'sunglasses', 'beach', 'borrow', 'Benny', 'father', 'cherished', 'Mercedes', 'convertible', 'Benny', 'reluctantly', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'misadventures', 'as', 'soon', 'arrive', 'beach', 'chasing', 'sexy', 'bikini', 'clad', 'chicks', 'are', 'many', 'Durrell', 'dumb', 'rivalry', 'goofy', 'white', 'wannabe', 'homeboy', 'named', 'Mikey', 'Z', 'then', 'volleyball', 'tournament', 'said', 'dont', 'expect', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'times', 'so', 'amateurish', 'pacing', 'way', 'most', 'direction', 'bit', 'sloppy', 'most', 'supporting', '34', 'actors', '34', 'look', ""'re"", 'posing', 'front', 'camera', 'instead', 'trying', 'create', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'performances', 'etc', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Hopkins', 'Hooks', 'times', 'Hooks', 'almost', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'movie', 'fast', 'talking', 'manic', 'portrayal', 'Durrell', 'Hopkins', 'likeable', 'put', 'Benny', 'However', 'real', 'attraction', 'film', 'large', 'percentage', 'hot', 'sexy', 'women', 'film', 'especially', 'Claudia', 'Kaseem', 'Benny', 'dream', 'girl', 'Devin', 'DeRay', 'who', 'cameo', 'stripper', '.Mmmmmm', 'case', 'like', 'occasional', 'dumb', 'movie', 'too', 'as', 'long', 'entertainment', 'value', '34', 'Phat', 'Beach', '34', 'qualifies', 'bit', 'dont', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'can', 'enjoy', 'what', ""'ll"", 'like']",Phat Beach artisan

I had avoided watching this movie for a long time due to negative reviews but I finally caved in and saw it. As I was watching it, I found myself laughing as the movie went along. Phat Beach doesnt take itself serious so why should you?Phat Beach is a coming of age story about a plump kid named Benny(Jermaine Hopkins) who is unsatisfied with his summer and reluctantly joins his boisterous friend Durrel on a trip to the beach. Benny borrows his father's car for the trip and the rest of the movie deals with their misadventures at the beach.Jermaine Hopkins is immensely likable as Benny. He comes of misguided at times but has a heart. Bryan Hooks is hilarious as the mischievous Durell. Granted that there are time when I didnt laugh but I laughed at 85% of this movie. That's way more then I ever laughed at any of the so-called comedies that are out these days(including anything by Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg). I find these critics amusing. All this talk about quality films while they're religiously watching Quentin Tarantino's(overrated one-trick pony hack)crappy overrated films. Pulleeze! Oh yeah, the amateur critic reviewer thinks that Leonard Part 6 is a great movie. Nuff said.At any rate Phat Beach is an underrated funny treat for people who dont pretend to be high-brow movie critics and can enjoy a movie for what it is.

664366,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00005LQ01,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[3, 8]","I really, really wanted to like Phat Beach. The premise of an African-American beach movie had a lot of promise. What could have been an original, unique and entertaining movie was done in by a lack of effort. I was expecting a campy hip-hop version of ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" but instead wound up watching an awful unfunny film that didn't know what it was about. Was it a beach movie or a ghetto comedy? I really don't care. I want the 90 minutes of my life back that his film stole.Phat Beach had its potential undermined by poor production values, horrible acting, and a script that seemed t be written by a chimp. The plot of the movie went in more directions than an ADD kid. I couldn't like any of the characters because I never got know any of them. It seemed everyone in this movie had a personality that was as deep as a Dixie cup. I'm still figuring out who is the main character, Benny or Terrell? Why do they want to go to the beach? Supposedly to sell sunglasses, but they never do that. Then there's a volleyball contest, he runs into his parents wins the contest and gets the girl. The End. However, that's the same as the beginning, a really bad rap video that features none of the actors in the film. And I'm still figuring out why the white guy was Terrell's rival and not Benny's.Don't get me wrong I really like bad movies, the cheesier the better. The cheesily Krafted flicks made by the defunct Cannon Group and the late Samuel Z. Arkoff (American Ninja, Ninja III, Dixie Dynamite, Bleach Blanket Bingo and How to stuff a Wild Bikini) try hard to entertain and overcome their poor production values with a great script, strong effort by the actors and the director. The enthusiasm and energy you feel from everyone in the film makes you overlook the obstacle of a low budget and like the film. However Phat Beach feels so [poorly made] that I felt like I was watching somebody's home videos. The lethargic performances of the actors are so bad that it reminds me of a high school play. It seems no one tried to make this film work. It's a shame too, because this could have been a great film if the production team had a good script and the actors camped it up. All I can say is: Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't borrow it from the library. Don't even watch it on TV. You will wish you cleaned the gutters for 90 minutes rather than watch this film.",1,I want the 90 minutes of my life back.
