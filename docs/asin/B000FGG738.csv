I always thought Eric Clapton and James Burton were great guitarists, but John can cut licks with the best of them.Hot Rod Heart from the 1997 album Blue Moon Swamp is an incredible performance. The audience is alternately applauding, dancing, bobbing their heads, singing along, and roaring with delight at John's contagious enthusiasm and remarkable guitar prowess. Let's go riding! This song segues into a great rendition of Rambunctious Boy, from the same Grammy-winning album.

John Fogerty and his top-notch band deliver everything that a great rock n' roll concert should be: a great setlist of classic songs, strong musicianship, and positive energy that radiates from the stage and rocks the socks off every person in the audience. I agree with some other reviewers...John looks and performs at least 20 years younger than his real age in this show! As nice as it would be to see Creedence get back together someday, this concert makes it obvious that Fogerty is getting along better than ever without his old bandmates. This is John Fogerty in 2005 rockin' like it is 1970 all over again!!60 years young when this concert was filmed, the fabulous Fogerty has lost nothing with age and spends an hour and a half rocking all over the stage with the energy and enthusiasm of a 30 year old! This is a great high-energy concert of pure American rock n' roll at its very best, performed by an ageless master of bayou/boogie rock who can still entertain a crowd with the best of them. John performs TEN Creedence classics not heard in his first concert video {Premonition} including ""Run through the Jungle"", ""Up around the Bend"", ""Have you ever seen the Rain"", and a nice version of ""Lodi"" that rocks harder than the original.An underrated guitarist, John lays down some hot solos on nearly every song and his singing is as strong as ever. The many shots of the audience enjoying the music really adds to the experience when you watch the DVD. Everyone in the Wiltern Theater is on their feet enjoying every minute of this show as Fogerty and his skin tight band deliver one classic hit after another. The cameraman also seems a little smitten on some hotties shaking their stuff to the music as the energy level only grows stronger in the second half of the show. ""Old man down the road"" and ""Fortunate Son"" are two highlights that are played back to back and will have you glued to your screen.This has to be the best concert video release of 2006. This is John Fogerty UNLEASHED and sounding stronger than you've heard him since Creedence! Do yourselves a favor folks. Get your woman to turn off American Idol for one night, order an extra large pizza, turn down the lights, and blast this DVD through a good set of speakers for the best rock n' roll experience you will ever have in your own living room. I dare anyone to show me a better rock concert DVD than this. If pure American rock n' roll is your thing, this DVD is your ticket to paradise! John Cameron Fogerty simply blows away anybody on the charts today as this concert proves without a doubt. This ranks with Carl Perkins' 1985 masterpiece ""Rockabilly Session"" as one of the finest rock n' roll performances ever put on video.",5,FOGERTY FOREVER!

He is right up there with Chuck Berry and Bruce Springsteen and a small handful of other legendary US rock n' roll songwriters, and this DVD finds him still going strong at 60 years of age.Most of these songs are Creedence songs, and most of them have been available live for a long time and in several different versions. But there are also a couple of (relative) rarities here, like the semi-acoustic ""Bootleg"" and the lovely, rockabilly-like ""Blue Moon Nights"".John Fogerty has no fewer than three other guitarist for company, and while he doesn't quite allow them to shine as much as he could have, it does result in some rough, tough and really beefy renditions of songs like ""Lodi"", ""Rambunctious Boy"", ""She's Got Baggage"", the riff-driven gem ""Green River"" and the ultimate swamp rocker, the five-minute ""Born on the Bayou"".Other classic Creedence songs, particularly ""Bad Moon Rising"", ""Proud Mary"", and ""Up Around the Bend"", sound a little bit tired to me, but maybe that's just because you've heard them so many times before. I would like to have heard Fogerty spice up the minimalistic, stacatto solos he has been playing for 40 years, though...contrary to what you might think if you have only ever heard him playing ""Proud Mary"" or ""Fortunate Son"", he is actually a really fine lead guitarist. Just listen to the wonderful, bluesy fills and lead breaks he plays on ""Tombstone Shadow"", one of the absolute highlights of the set.This is five-star material really, but I went with four stars anyway, because as good as this is, it could have been even better. John Fogerty's voice sounds a little thin and strained on a few songs, which he still sings in their original high register. And then there's the solo thing. And finally - and most importantly: It would have been sooooo great to have had some more rarities here, songs which weren't on his previous live DVD, ""Premonition"", but which have been played live many times during the past decade. Songs like ""It Came Out of the Sky"", ""Big Train (from Memphis)"", ""Southern Streamline"", the soulful ""Long as I can See the Light"", or the thoughful ""Wrote a Song for Everyone"".(And wouldn't it have been great to hear him playing the early blues number ""Get Down Woman"", or maybe even something from ""Hoodoo""?)But, still...what is here is obviously terrific.

As others have observed, John Fogerty seems not to have aged a day since CCR were at their height. He leaps and jumps around the stage, all the while never missing a lick on his guitar and barely raising a sweat. John and his tight band take a run through most of CCR's hits and several of John's solo songs.When you've got a concert like this with practically every song known and most a classic at that, it's hard to pick a favorite moment. My favorite CCR song is ""Born on the Bayou"" and it's excellently represented here, but my favorite song in this particular concert DVD may be ""Keep On Chooglin'"" and here's why: John starts out doing a classical run on his guitar before launching in the song, where he sings lead (of course) and plays harmonica. For me, it's just the highest spot of the concert in a concert full of many. The little classical bit is just a tease of how talented this man is.I've seen Fogerty's Premonition concert and it's excellent also. I can't pick between the two. But I recommend either one very highly. And The Long Road Home is available at a premium price, so snatch it up. You'll be cranking your home system way up and shaking the walls!

Forgerty performs just about all of the great CCR songs and some of his great solo songs.  This is the closest DVD to a live performance of CCR, but that probably won't ever happen because of the bitterness between Fogerty and his former bandmates Stu Cook and Doug Clifford.  It's sad but funny how none of them will ever back down from that long drawn out argument.  Since Fogerty was the lead guitarist and lead singer of CCR and proves that he is still more than capable for performing both duties, you do not miss Cook or Cifford at all (ironically, the bassist on this DVD looks a little like Cook).  Fogerty also used an excellent backing band for this concert, but he is the true star and the focus of the show.  Fogerty may not still be able to hit those high notes like he used to but his voice still sounds great and he sings his heart out.  His guitar playing here is even better than his singing and I would rate him as one of the best guitarists who ever lived.  There are plenty of closeups of Fogerty playing the guitar and he is even willing to share the spotlight with the members of his backing band.  You could certainly tell that Fogerty his having a great time playing his music and singing his songs and he is extremely appreciative of his fans throughout the whole show.  In addition to his singing and playing, he also does a great job talking to the audience between some songs.  The camera work is fantastic.  There are very few shots of the audience which is definitely a plus and the sound is outstanding.

Being born in 1984, I was afraid that I would never get to see him in concert, and now I have been to THREE!  I have to say that I was quite pleased but just slightly disappointed with this DVD.  The performance on it is great as is the picture quality.  I thought that the sound quality was fine; for those who thought it sounded weird, did you try setting the sound to digital surround?  The 5.1 surround setting did sound strange to me.  If you set it to digital surround, it is much better.My main problem with this DVD however, is the video.  Like I said, the QUALITY is great, buth there is something about the way this DVD (and many of today's concert DVD's) was filmed.  The video doesn't actually feel ""live"".  Compare it to the Premonition DVD.  This one kind of feels more like you're watching a long music video rather than a concert.  Not to mention the sound and video are a bit out of synch.But anyway, it's still great to have a concert recording of John doing several CCR hits that I never thought he would do live again such as ""Bootleg"" and ""Keep On Chooglin"" just to name a few.Rock on, John!",3,More Like 3.5 Stars,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,1188,"['Let', 'start', 'review', 'saying', 'am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'John', 'Fogerty/CCR', 'Being', 'born', '1984', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'concert', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'THREE', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'just', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'performance', 'great', 'picture', 'quality', 'thought', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'fine', 'who', 'thought', 'sounded', 'weird', 'did', 'try', 'setting', 'sound', 'digital', 'surround', '5.1', 'surround', 'setting', 'did', 'sound', 'strange', 'set', 'digital', 'surround', 'much', 'better.My', 'main', 'problem', 'DVD', 'however', 'video', 'said', 'QUALITY', 'great', 'buth', 'something', 'way', 'DVD', 'many', 'today', 'concert', 'DVD', 'was', 'filmed', 'video', ""n't"", 'actually', 'feel', 'live', 'Compare', 'Premonition', 'DVD', 'one', 'kind', 'feels', 'more', ""'re"", 'watching', 'long', 'music', 'video', 'rather', 'concert', 'Not', 'mention', 'sound', 'video', 'are', 'bit', 'synch.But', 'anyway', 'still', 'great', 'have', 'concert', 'recording', 'John', 'doing', 'several', 'CCR', 'hits', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'do', 'live', 'again', 'such', 'Bootleg', 'Keep', 'Chooglin', 'just', 'name', 'few.Rock', 'John']",N/A

You got your ears on, bud?""  Fans of Fogerty's songwriting will prefer this new disc, as EVERY tune in the concert is one of this rock master's finest, and that is very fine indeed.This Wiltern show was also performed before a much larger audience than in the Premonition disc, again giving the new disc added vitality.Speaking of vitality, whatever does John Fogerty eat?  He looks and sounds so much like his much younger self that it's almost spooky.At any rate, if you're a fan of classic American rock & roll, get this disc, roll back the carpet, and crank it!

He and his backup band are in fine form and perform all of Fogerty's biggest hits.  However, John's voice isn't what it used to be.  Compare the audio on this DVD to an original CCR recording.  John's voice here is good, but not powerful and emotional like it was then.Earlier this year I went to see Creedence Clearwater Revisited and that vocalist (John Tristao) was amazing, and sounded just like the old Fogerty.My recommendation:  pick this up.

A 5 star rating for me is perfection and John's voice seemed just a little off on the first two tracks, especially the first one. So, this is a 4.9 star performance that I rounded up. As the concert progresses and Mr. Fogerty gets into the groove, he rocks the house! Just about all his hits are sung (with a few notables not played) plus some more recent material.The band is great, the recording engineers are equal to the task, and the camera work is spot on. I also like that this as a concert DVD instead of what often happens --mixing interviews and documentary between the songs. It feels like a concert, not a documentary. If your TV is plugged into your Audio Video Receiver, BY ALL MEANS, CRANK UP THE VOLUME!! I sure did. Fogerty's music and lyrics have certainly stood the test of time and still are fresh and speak today.The quality of this DVD is on par with other great classic rock DVDs such as: the Eagles Farewell I DVDs and Loggins & Messina recent DVD.

The concert was Filmed in 2005 in Los Angeles. The DVD is an hour and a half long (99 minutes).I have always enjoyed CCR and Fogerty, and this is an amazing concert includes some of the greatest songs from CCR and Fogerty. The DVD starts with an introduction then rips right into Travelin' Band, Green River, and Who'll Stop The Rain which are a fantastic start to the first set.However, some of my favorite CCR/Fogrety songs don't come until well into the concert with Hey Tonight, Down On The Corner, Centerfield, Up Around The Bend, The Old Man Down The Road, Fortunate Son, and Bad Moon Rising all not coming after the first hour in. Fortunately, Rockin' All Over The World, Proud Mary and a bonus rendition of Deja Vu (All Over Again) bring the concert to a rousing close.If you are looking at buying the Long Road Home DVD and the Long Home CD, it's interesting to point out that while they include most of the same tracks, the track orders are different and there are some variations.

I agree with some other reviewers...John looks and acts at least 20 years younger than his real age! What kind of herbs or vitamins is this guy taking??? This is John Fogerty in 2005 rockin' like it is 1970 all over again!!It is unbelievable that Fogerty is over 60 as he spends an hour and a half running up and down the stage with the energy and excitement of a 30 year old! He is clearly having a blast throughout this show, and the audience is enjoying themselves just as much. I'm 29 years old, and I can honestly say the music here blows away anything on the charts right now. This is a great high-energy concert of rock n' roll at its very best, played by a man who is probably the best rock n' roller of the past 40 years!As nice as it would be to see Creedence get back together someday, this concert makes it obvious that Fogerty is getting along better than ever without his old bandmates. His new band here is top-notch, and John rocks his heart out from start to finish! His singing and guitar playing are as strong as ever.An underrated guitarist, John shows he can definitely rock out on the solos throughout this concert. Fogerty TEARS IT UP on guitar on ""Old Man Down the Road""!!  The concert is at a fever pitch during this tune, and he keeps the energy level sky high with a powerhouse version of ""Fortunate Son"".I've not seen the Premonition video, but I have heard the album of it. This concert is every bit as good if not better than that 1997 show. There is a bigger and better selection of songs here to savor. John performs TEN Creedence classics not heard in Premonition including ""Run through the Jungle"", ""Up around the Bend"", ""Have you ever seen the Rain"", and a nice version of ""Lodi"" that rocks harder than the original.

He is truly the heart and soul of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Even as he approaches his late 60's, Fogerty was prancing around the stage and belting out his old CCD classics and some of his new solo material. It was a very memorable concert DVD to add to my collection. I have to admit that I went to the Creedence Clearwater Revisited concert just last week minus Fogerty. When that solo singer, who was replacing Fogerty sang the first bars of the first CCR classic, my heart sank. It was nowhere near the distinctive voice of Fogerty. It was a poor substitute. But as the concert progressed the packed crowd I must say including myself really got into the music of the old CCR songs. The band really tried and gave a pretty good concert. People were dancing and singing along. But now after seeing ""John Fogerty The Long Road Home in Concert"" DVD tonight I knew what was missing - John Fogerty. He sounds even better than his younger days when he as part of CCR. His new band is top notch. CCR fans get this DVD and sit back and enjoy Fogerty and his songs!",5,Fogerty is the heart and soul of CCR,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,1209,"['was', 'overwhelmed', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'energy', 'passion', 'John', 'Fogerty', 'watching', 'John', 'Fogerty', 'Long', 'Road', 'Home', 'Concert', 'DVD', 'truly', 'heart', 'soul', 'Creedence', 'Clearwater', 'Revival', 'Even', 'late', '60', 'Fogerty', 'was', 'prancing', 'stage', 'belting', 'out', 'old', 'CCD', 'classics', 'new', 'solo', 'material', 'was', 'very', 'memorable', 'concert', 'DVD', 'add', 'collection', 'have', 'admit', 'went', 'Creedence', 'Clearwater', 'Revisited', 'concert', 'just', 'last', 'week', 'minus', 'Fogerty', 'When', 'solo', 'singer', 'who', 'was', 'replacing', 'Fogerty', 'sang', 'first', 'bars', 'first', 'CCR', 'classic', 'heart', 'sank', 'was', 'nowhere', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'Fogerty', 'was', 'poor', 'substitute', 'concert', 'progressed', 'packed', 'crowd', 'must', 'say', 'including', 'really', 'got', 'music', 'old', 'CCR', 'songs', 'band', 'really', 'tried', 'gave', 'pretty', 'good', 'concert', 'People', 'were', 'dancing', 'singing', 'along', 'now', 'seeing', 'John', 'Fogerty', 'Long', 'Road', 'Home', 'Concert', 'DVD', 'tonight', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'John', 'Fogerty', 'even', 'better', 'younger', 'days', 'when', 'part', 'CCR', 'new', 'band', 'top', 'notch', 'CCR', 'fans', 'get', 'DVD', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'Fogerty', 'songs']",N/A

For years, John Fogerty had lost the rights to his own music. It might be considered strong language to say that the songs were `stolen' from him, but suffice to say that a bad contract and an ethically challenged record label prevented Fogerty from realizing royalty payments from any of his Creedence Clearwater Revival material. To prevent the `bad guys' from profiteering off of his work, Fogerty vowed not to play any of his old hits, and he stuck by his word for approximately two decades. Recently, though, Saul Zaentz, the head of Fantasy Records, sold his interest in Fantasy Records and was replaced by a team that was much more sympathetic to Fogerty, restoring his rights to compositions such as ""Proud Mary,"" ""Bad Moon Rising,"" ""Green River,"" and dozens of other timeless classics. For the first time since Creedence disbanded in 1973, Fogerty can now play his own songs with no sense of ambivalence. I, for one, am extraordinarily happy for the guy, and I'm especially glad to see that he has survived ""the long road home.""To simply say that he has survived is a gross understatement. Have you seen John Fogerty lately? If not, wait until you see just how energetic and lively he is. If Dick Clark made a deal with the devil to retain his youthfulness, then John Fogerty stole the formula. He is brimming with vitality, and his powerful voice is 100% intact. The concert featured on ""The Long Road Home"" boasts over two dozen tracks, at least twenty of which I'd consider to be classic. Each song is played straight and hard, with no ornate touches and no meandering jams. Even on the songs that warrant it, such as ""Tombstone Shadow"" and ""Keep on Chooglin',"" are played with a directness that emphasizes their intrinsic value.Fogerty may have gotten more hits out of three chords and a guitar riff than any other human being, and this live set argues that point convincingly. Throughout the show, Fogerty effortlessly proves that he is a master of simple, powerful, well-written rock and roll. ""Down on the Corner,"" ""Centerfield,"" ""Up Around the Bend,"" ""Old Man Down the Road"" and ""Fortunate Son"" follow one another in quick succession, which is enough to leave any casual fan breathless. Some of these songs are nearly forty years old, but they still sound fresh and vital. Finally, John Fogerty is dancing to his own tune.

Having seen Fogerty at the Filmore when he played to promote ""Premonition"" and that video I found this to be an exceptional concert. I personally liked the ""Premonition"" DVD better although this one does include material from his last studio album including the single ""Deja Vu (All Over Again)"" (with a touch of humor it's included twice).The direction is sharp keeping most of the focus on Fogerty. At 61 John can still belt these classics out and his guitar playing remains top notch (he's also quite good on dobro and slide). I would have liked to see more bonus material in the form of rehearsals or, perhaps, a couple of unusual cover songs that he might have played with the band during sound checks but overall the quality of the DVD is terrific.Now that John is realigned with Fantasy (Saul Zaentz who went from John's friend to nemesis is gone having sold the company and the company made overtures to reestablish a relationship with its most famous musician)perhaps we'll see his second solo album ""John Fogerty"" (aka ""Shep"")released domestically with improved sound and bonus tracks. It would be nice to finally have this underrated classic available with bonus tracks (perhaps the pair of singles John released just before the album was released).If you don't have ""Premonition"" or would like to add to your Fogerty live DVD collection (this is only the second offically released live DVD from Fogerty)this is a must have.
