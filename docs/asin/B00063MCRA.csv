858156,A2R1R907SMOJHD,B00063MCRA,Alastair G. Stell,"[5, 5]","Starhunter 2300 has competent, interesting scripts, some quirky, likeable characters, and even some tense romantic undercurrents which begin to surface just before the series is abruptly cut short. Production values are reasonable, if you allow the spacecraft look like they escaped from a video game.There are two carry-over characters from Starhunter (the original series) and they are more fully developed in this series. Percy in particular is a huge amount of fun as a character.Scripts are tight and I feel with further updates to the special effects this TV series could easily outclass anything the Sci-Fi channel puts on the air these days. Another season was merited but denied and with the passage of time there is less and less chance of a resurection.With appropriate promotion, better effects and some TLC this franchise could so easily be turned into a winner. Shame on the studios for their lack of vision.Callista is simply wonderful; both the actress and the character deserve more screen time. Her character is three dimensional and develops over the series. I found myself caring, which is unusual since most sci-fi series are too cheesy to elicit that kind of response.",5,Fun sci-fi for the fans,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,1190,"['Starhunter', '2300', 'competent', 'interesting', 'scripts', 'quirky', 'likeable', 'characters', 'even', 'tense', 'romantic', 'undercurrents', 'begin', 'surface', 'just', 'series', 'abruptly', 'cut', 'short', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'reasonable', 'allow', 'spacecraft', 'look', 'escaped', 'video', 'are', 'two', 'carry-over', 'characters', 'Starhunter', 'original', 'series', 'are', 'more', 'fully', 'developed', 'series', 'Percy', 'particular', 'huge', 'amount', 'fun', 'character.Scripts', 'are', 'tight', 'feel', 'further', 'updates', 'special', 'effects', 'TV', 'series', 'could', 'easily', 'outclass', 'anything', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'air', 'days', 'season', 'was', 'merited', 'denied', 'passage', 'time', 'less', 'less', 'chance', 'resurection.With', 'appropriate', 'promotion', 'better', 'effects', 'TLC', 'franchise', 'could', 'so', 'easily', 'be', 'turned', 'winner', 'Shame', 'studios', 'lack', 'vision.Callista', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'character', 'deserve', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'character', 'three', 'dimensional', 'series', 'found', 'caring', 'unusual', 'most', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'are', 'too', 'cheesy', 'elicit', 'kind', 'response']",Starhunter 2300: The Complete Series

858158,A3PD8JD9L4WEII,B00063MCRA,"Bron ""Bron""","[5, 5]","I liked this second ""season"" of the Star Hunter series.  It was obviously better financed, has better writing, more polished production values, and so on.  I wasn't sure about the new cast, but I grew to like them and enjoyed both series a lot.  Overall, I preferred the original first series, because I found the story themes better and more engrossing (even if the writer's screenplay skills were sometimes lacking).  But I thoroughly enjoyed this installment, although at the end I felt it flagged a bit.This DVD set is much better as far as polish, production and packaging than the first.  Worth the money.P.S. I feel very sure Joss Whedon was familiar with this series, especially the first season, since there are many similarities and references in FireFly/Serenity that can only be homage to StarHunter.  Maybe one day someone will ask him.  Firefly was a much better series overall, one of the best Sci-Fi series ever (IMHO).  I'd give my left toe to be able to go back in time and see it get a nice 5 seasons or so run.  It's a tragedy that Fox execs were so incredibly stupid and mishandled it so badly.

With the exception of the office I just don't watch them.My review is more geared at someone like me that was looking for something cheap and maybe interesting and has no clue about the show.  I read one review that said this was like firefly...  This has spaceships and that's about where any similarity ends... well, i guess there are guns too and space.The acting is terrible.  Seriously.  The plot has holes the size of... something that's really really really like mind blowing big, and then bigger than that.  I watched this and my response was ""hey!  That's like how a DnD group gets together!""  You give someone your horrible back story and suddenly you join up with a complete stranger for fun adventures.  That's how it starts.It doesn't explain itself or the background very well.  It just moves you forward.  The onscreen chemistry it tries to develop (I'm pretty sure they were trying) is horrible.  Someone dies and you're just like ""thank goodness it wasn't the crazy hot one"")I gave it three stars because I enjoy bad sci fi from time to time.  After i stopped trying to blow my brains out over the gigantic holes in plot and simply let my brain melt into a puddle of goo stupor, i enjoyed the nonsensical brain candy and horrible writing.  It's like those really sour candies, but for the brain.  Some people like them, and some don't and if you enjoy the sour there will be some sweet in the middle.Not something I'd recommend, but some people will definitely like it.  If you tend to like shows that others think were dumb (like you were a fan of DnD the movie), you'll likely enjoy this and wonder what I'm talking about.  If you like bad sci fi, you'll likely suffer for a bit and then come around to enjoy it.  If you want a quality show.  Avoid this.

I only caught a few episodes of it, and recently (because I liked this release so much) bought it on DVD.  I really am enjoying it.  Anyway, Starhunter 2300 may have been similarly aired in such vespertine hours, but if it was, I missed it altogether.  This show is a restructured version of the original.  Similar pretense, some different characters (Michael Pare is gone), more special effects, and some decent writing.  I have this box set and have watched about halfway through so far.  I will watch the rest and have enjoyed myself thus far.  It is an adventure show set in space, on a par writing-wise, quality-wise, enjoyment-level-wise with something like Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World tv series, though a little less silly and more somber in tone than that particular show.  Some of the characters are endearing, though I have to say Tanya Allen is not as fun this time around.  Her character is more dour than quirky sometimes, though it does fit her character's new situation.  This show has production similarities to a sci fi show like Lexx, as they are both products of Canada (you will see character actors from Lexx and other Canadian genre shows you may recognize appear from time to time).  This show is not as dark or sarcastic as Lexx (or as silly), though, but it is a darker show than a lot of other sci fi things that have ended up in syndication.  There are, as others have mentioned, certain similarities with Firefly, the short-lived Fox series of a few years ago (eventually resurrecting in movie Serenity) in the setting and crew of characters, but these are superficial.  It is not as well acted, written or directed as Firefly was.  It is not as engrossing as Firefly.  It is a fun indulgence, like watching Saturday afternoon episodes of syndicated action/adventure or sci fi.  It's better than Andromeda (more consistent, makes more sense, more hardcore sci fi ideas, less incoherent spiritual sidetrips, similar level of special effects).  No where near as epic as Babylon 5 or even Deep Space Nine (not that they are on the same level).  It's episodic sci fi and if you're into that, here's some more.  If you know you watch anything sci fi they put on the air because you're a rabid sci fi fan, then you should seek this out, because it's better than a bunch of shows you sat through already and told yourself were worth it.  This show should have gotten a better chance to be seen here in the states.
