1013160,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000HDR9RC,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 1]","Austin City Limits Neko Case Live From Austin Texas presents indie/alt country performer Neko case in a stripped down show recorded August9, 2003. Case performed with her band that featured Holly Hogan on vocals, Jon Rauhouse on guitar and Tom V. Ray on bass.While Neko Case may not be known to many people now it is hoped she soon will be. She has one of the strongest voices that I've heard in quite a while and this DVd showcases her early catalogue quite well. Most of the compositions are originals and while they may not be heard on normal radio they are well crafted and each is a gem in its own way. Case also performs covers by Sarah Vaughn, Bob Dylan, and Hank Williams. Standouts includeKnock Loud, Hex, In California, Maybe Sparrow, Wayfaring Stranger and Look for Me (I'll Be Around).If there is a slight complaint it's the brevity of the performance which clocks in at just under fifty minutes. Now is the time to release more material from this talented singer songwriter.Check it out.",4,Incredible Voice But Hard To Describe,1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,1000,"['Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'Neko', 'Case', 'Live', 'From', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'indie/alt', 'country', 'performer', 'Neko', 'case', 'stripped', 'down', 'show', 'recorded', 'August9', '2003', 'Case', 'performed', 'band', 'featured', 'Holly', 'Hogan', 'vocals', 'Jon', 'Rauhouse', 'guitar', 'Tom', 'V.', 'Ray', 'bass.While', 'Neko', 'Case', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'known', 'many', 'people', 'now', 'hoped', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'strongest', 'voices', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'quite', 'while', 'DVd', 'early', 'catalogue', 'quite', 'well', 'Most', 'compositions', 'are', 'originals', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'heard', 'normal', 'radio', 'are', 'well', 'crafted', 'gem', 'own', 'way', 'Case', 'also', 'covers', 'Sarah', 'Vaughn', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'Standouts', 'includeKnock', 'Loud', 'Hex', 'California', 'Maybe', 'Sparrow', 'Wayfaring', 'Stranger', 'Look', 'Me', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Around', '.If', 'slight', 'complaint', 'brevity', 'performance', 'just', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'Now', 'time', 'release', 'more', 'material', 'talented', 'singer', 'songwriter.Check', 'out']",N/A
1013161,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000HDR9RC,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","To be honest, this is my first exposure to Neko Case as a solo artist. I'm a huge fan of the work she does with New Pornographers and haven't really properly checked out her more singer/songwriter albums. She's got quite a unique voice and you can almost instantly tell when you hear Case singing as opposed to some singers where I can't tell unless I checked out the CD cover first. This is shown in this DVD that, while a short set, it's still a great performance anchored by a stunning voice.A lot of singer/songwriters write music that sometimes isn't really catchy or easy to sing along with but you just love hearing it anyway. So while Neko Case might do music that won't immediately get into your head, you love that it's going there in the first place. Largely stripped down with only 4 performers, she of course takes center stage and does some originals as well as some covers by Hank Williams to Bob Dylan. While some might prefer she did more originals and even throw in a re-arranged New Pornographers song, she still brings her all. One song ends with an amazing falsetto on her part; just too bad there's not enough of it.Despite it's 14 song set, it's a pretty short set, clocking in around 50 minutes. But for Neko Case fans, it's a worthwhile purchase.",5,"A lovely, although short, performance",1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,1271,"['be', 'honest', 'first', 'exposure', 'Neko', 'Case', 'solo', 'artist', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'work', 'New', 'Pornographers', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'properly', 'checked', 'out', 'more', 'singer/songwriter', 'albums', 'got', 'quite', 'unique', 'voice', 'can', 'almost', 'instantly', 'tell', 'when', 'hear', 'Case', 'singing', 'opposed', 'singers', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'checked', 'out', 'CD', 'cover', 'first', 'shown', 'DVD', 'short', 'set', 'still', 'great', 'performance', 'anchored', 'stunning', 'voice.A', 'lot', 'singer/songwriters', 'write', 'music', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'really', 'catchy', 'easy', 'sing', 'along', 'just', 'love', 'hearing', 'anyway', 'So', 'Neko', 'Case', 'might', 'do', 'music', 'wo', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'get', 'head', 'love', 'going', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'Largely', 'stripped', 'down', 'only', '4', 'performers', 'course', 'center', 'stage', 'originals', 'as', 'well', 'covers', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'might', 'prefer', 'did', 'more', 'originals', 'even', 'throw', 're-arranged', 'New', 'Pornographers', 'song', 'still', 'One', 'song', 'amazing', 'falsetto', 'part', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'enough', 'it.Despite', '14', 'song', 'set', 'pretty', 'short', 'set', 'clocking', '50', 'minutes', 'Neko', 'Case', 'fans', 'worthwhile', 'purchase']",N/A

How come Neko Case isn't well known,but someone that isn't that good is???

I was not disappointed.  There is a lot of informative banter in between songs that did not make it to the CD.  And it was nice to put a face to the band members.  Neko was not the most interesting performed (maybe she was nervous?) but her singing was impeccable.  Highly recommended.,4,Unique and powerful singer,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,391,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'listening', 'CD', 'performance', 'months', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'lot', 'informative', 'banter', 'songs', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'CD', 'was', 'nice', 'put', 'face', 'band', 'members', 'Neko', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'interesting', 'performed', 'maybe', 'was', 'nervous', 'singing', 'was', 'impeccable', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1013165,A2DLVJVYAVG37U,B000HDR9RC,Up The Stairs,"[2, 2]","I came into the Neko Case camp a bit late, having received her album, Fox Confessor, just a few months ago.  I had no idea the woman existed, but I am now a big fan.  After being intrigued by the album, I wanted to see her actually sing, so I bought this dvd from Amazon hoping for the best.  I am very satisfied with this Austin City Limits performance, but, after hearing Fox Confessor, it does sound a bit dated.  Having said that, I want to point out that it really doesn't matter.  She's a great singer and a very gracious and generous performer.  I'm not sure if I've ever watched anybody sing with such heartfelt warmth for her audience.On this dvd she has a sparse, yet tight band.  She also employs a back-up singer along with the other four musicians.  It is all very good stuff, a bit country, but mostly straight ahead music.  She has since moved slightly left of country and more into a jazz-folk sound, and that could explain my comment about the performance seeming dated.  Nonetheless, it is great stuff, and I highly recommend Neko Case on Austin City Limits.  I look for big things from Neko Case in the future.  She definitely is an improvement over the stale sounds being thrown at us from the corporate offerings.",4,Extremely good,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,1234,"['came', 'Neko', 'Case', 'bit', 'late', 'having', 'received', 'album', 'Fox', 'Confessor', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'had', 'idea', 'woman', 'existed', 'am', 'now', 'big', 'fan', 'being', 'intrigued', 'album', 'wanted', 'see', 'actually', 'sing', 'bought', 'dvd', 'Amazon', 'hoping', 'best', 'am', 'very', 'satisfied', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'performance', 'hearing', 'Fox', 'Confessor', 'sound', 'bit', 'dated', 'Having', 'said', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'great', 'singer', 'very', 'gracious', 'generous', 'performer', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'anybody', 'sing', 'such', 'heartfelt', 'warmth', 'audience.On', 'dvd', 'sparse', 'yet', 'tight', 'band', 'also', 'back-up', 'singer', 'other', 'four', 'musicians', 'very', 'good', 'stuff', 'bit', 'country', 'mostly', 'straight', 'ahead', 'music', 'moved', 'slightly', 'left', 'country', 'more', 'jazz-folk', 'sound', 'could', 'explain', 'comment', 'performance', 'seeming', 'dated', 'Nonetheless', 'great', 'stuff', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Neko', 'Case', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'look', 'big', 'things', 'Neko', 'Case', 'future', 'definitely', 'improvement', 'stale', 'sounds', 'being', 'thrown', 'corporate', 'offerings']",N/A
