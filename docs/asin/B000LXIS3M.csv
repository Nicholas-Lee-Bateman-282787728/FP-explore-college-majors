1041894,A2V0SXSULK4W0E,B000LXIS3M,Barry J. James,"[3, 3]","After reading many of the reviews for the various DVDs available from Valentina Lisitsa, I decided to purchase Black and Pink and see for myself. The program of works by Liszt, Ravel, Chopin, and Rachmaninov was certainly well chosen to show off Ms. Lisitsa's formidable talents.I do not have any musical background so will refrain from commenting on the technical aspects of her performance. However, I thoroughly enjoyed each of the works presented here and, comparing her performance of Liszt's Reminiscences of Don Juan with Lang Lang's on his `Live from Carnegie Hall' DVD, much prefer her calmer and more dignified and authoritative style.After being critical, in some of my other reviews, of the conductor or soloist's appearance, it is good to be able to say that on this recording Ms. Lisitsa wears two evening gowns (one obviously black, the other pink) that are both extremely attractive and very flattering. This would mean nothing if she was merely of average ability, however, for someone whose mastery of the keyboard is exceptional, this attention to presentation makes her stand out from all others. A small point of criticism would be to mention that the extremes of lighting used in the filming of this recital are not really necessary and add little or nothing to the quality of the performance. I look forward to acquiring more recordings of this artist and hope that we might have the opportunity to see her filming, with a quality orchestra, some of the concertos of Chopin, Saint-Saens and Rachmaninov.",5,Ms. Lisitsa is a pleasure to watch,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,1526,"['reading', 'many', 'reviews', 'various', 'DVDs', 'available', 'Valentina', 'Lisitsa', 'decided', 'purchase', 'Black', 'Pink', 'see', 'program', 'works', 'Liszt', 'Ravel', 'Chopin', 'Rachmaninov', 'was', 'certainly', 'well', 'chosen', 'show', 'off', 'Ms.', 'Lisitsa', 'formidable', 'talents.I', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'musical', 'background', 'so', 'will', 'refrain', 'commenting', 'technical', 'aspects', 'performance', 'However', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'works', 'presented', 'here', 'comparing', 'performance', 'Liszt', 'Reminiscences', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'Live', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'DVD', 'much', 'prefer', 'calmer', 'more', 'dignified', 'authoritative', 'style.After', 'being', 'critical', 'other', 'reviews', 'conductor', 'soloist', 'appearance', 'good', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'recording', 'Ms.', 'Lisitsa', 'two', 'evening', 'gowns', 'one', 'obviously', 'black', 'other', 'pink', 'are', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'very', 'flattering', 'would', 'mean', 'nothing', 'was', 'merely', 'average', 'ability', 'however', 'someone', 'mastery', 'keyboard', 'exceptional', 'attention', 'presentation', 'stand', 'out', 'others', 'small', 'point', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'mention', 'extremes', 'lighting', 'used', 'filming', 'recital', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'necessary', 'add', 'little', 'nothing', 'quality', 'performance', 'look', 'forward', 'acquiring', 'more', 'recordings', 'artist', 'hope', 'might', 'have', 'opportunity', 'see', 'filming', 'quality', 'orchestra', 'concertos', 'Chopin', 'Saint-Saens', 'Rachmaninov']",Black and Pink

1041897,ATZJZRFJHGUXZ,B000LXIS3M,"Peter T. Sipos ""Peter T. Sipos""","[19, 27]","Mixed opinions on this one.  The playing is effortless and brilliantly virtuosic.  Truly, she must rank among the foremost technicians of our era.Having said that, the big pieces on this recording, in my opinion, lack character.  The Don Juan fantasy lacks drama and personality.  It doesn't breath much.  It doesn't have the ""operatic"" feel that a good performance of this piece should.  Compare to Lang Lang's Carnegie Hall performance of the same work (also on DVD) and you'll see what I mean.  The Grand Gallop lacks fire and demonic flare.  The playing is effortless but the phrases are blah - it's like a mechanical piano.  Compare to Cziffra's performance (also on DVD) and you'll immediately notice the difference.  Of course, Cziffra is the standard - but it helps sometimes to compare to the standard. The Ravel - good heavens.  Where is the nocturnal mystery, the rushing water, the hanging corpse, the sinister gnome?  The music should conjure those images, not simply perfect arpeggios (though the arpeggios here certainly are perfect).Only the short pieces come across as real artwork.  The Rachmaninoff preludes are filled with real Russian melancholy and entirely unique voicing and phrasing.  These were truly wonderful.  Perhaps Valentina's personality is just more suited to Rachmaninoff than Liszt or Ravel.  Nothing wrong with that.  Ashkenazy's only attempt at Liszt back in his younger days was harshly criticized and I don't think he ever attempted it again.  But all in all, with the exception of the Rachmaninoff, these performances were as unmemorable to me musically as they were impressive technically.The photography was well done.  Nothing crazy, but there was enough variety to keep your interest.  There was plenty of focus on the hands.  The sound is PCM 2 channel stereo, but sounds just fine.  In fact, for piano music, I'm not so sure surround offers much.  Here the sound is clear, full and well synchronized with the picture.  There was no problem with the sound quality on my disc, as compared with the earlier reviewer.  However, the DVD menu is defective - it starts playing right away and does not offer you the choice of picking a given track.  For that, I have to skip forward manually (not the end of the world).  The piano is a Bosendorfer concert grand and has a wonderful sound.  The DVD is packaged in a non-standard DVD case - thinner than usual, but adequate.Okay, I have to say a few words about the ""theme.""  Personally, I don't like the whole pink dress/black dress thing.  Somehow I find such gimics rather insulting to the prestige of the artist.  If if was the artist's idea, I guess that's okay - I respect her artistic freedom.  But if this was some goofy vehicle on the part of the DVD producer, please no more.  Concert pianists are not show dogs.  Nobody requires Murray Perahia or Alfred Brendel to dress in artificial costumes, so let's extend the same respect to female artists.  Market the DVD based on the music, not the dress.  Okay, that's all from my high horse.So, if you like fast, brilliant, effortless piano playing, you'll like this disc.  If you like performances with nuance, drama and real feeling, I don't think you'll find that here (with the exception of the Rachmaninoff).  But also don't give up on this pianist.  Her recording of the Chopin Etudes is very fine and I'm looking forward to getting her DVD recording of Liszt's transcriptions of the songs from Schubert's Schwanengesang.  I also wouldn't mind playing her in chess - so few women play.",3,Great fingers; musicality leaves a bit to be desired.,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,3533,"['Mixed', 'opinions', 'one', 'playing', 'effortless', 'brilliantly', 'virtuosic', 'Truly', 'must', 'rank', 'foremost', 'technicians', 'era.Having', 'said', 'big', 'pieces', 'recording', 'opinion', 'lack', 'character', 'Don', 'Juan', 'fantasy', 'drama', 'personality', ""n't"", 'breath', 'much', ""n't"", 'have', 'operatic', 'feel', 'good', 'performance', 'piece', 'should', 'Compare', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'performance', 'same', 'work', 'also', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'Grand', 'Gallop', 'fire', 'demonic', 'flare', 'playing', 'effortless', 'phrases', 'are', 'blah', 'mechanical', 'piano', 'Compare', 'Cziffra', 'performance', 'also', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'immediately', 'notice', 'difference', 'course', 'Cziffra', 'standard', 'sometimes', 'compare', 'standard', 'Ravel', 'good', 'heavens', 'Where', 'nocturnal', 'mystery', 'rushing', 'water', 'hanging', 'corpse', 'sinister', 'gnome', 'music', 'should', 'conjure', 'images', 'not', 'simply', 'perfect', 'arpeggios', 'arpeggios', 'here', 'certainly', 'are', 'perfect', '.Only', 'short', 'pieces', 'come', 'real', 'artwork', 'Rachmaninoff', 'preludes', 'are', 'filled', 'real', 'Russian', 'melancholy', 'entirely', 'unique', 'voicing', 'phrasing', 'were', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'Perhaps', 'Valentina', 'personality', 'just', 'more', 'suited', 'Rachmaninoff', 'Liszt', 'Ravel', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'Ashkenazy', 'only', 'attempt', 'Liszt', 'back', 'younger', 'days', 'was', 'harshly', 'criticized', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'attempted', 'again', 'exception', 'Rachmaninoff', 'performances', 'were', 'unmemorable', 'musically', 'were', 'impressive', 'technically.The', 'photography', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'Nothing', 'crazy', 'was', 'enough', 'variety', 'keep', 'interest', 'was', 'plenty', 'focus', 'hands', 'sound', 'PCM', '2', 'channel', 'stereo', 'just', 'fine', 'fact', 'piano', 'music', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'surround', 'offers', 'much', 'Here', 'sound', 'clear', 'full', 'well', 'synchronized', 'picture', 'was', 'problem', 'sound', 'quality', 'disc', 'compared', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'However', 'DVD', 'menu', 'defective', 'playing', 'right', 'away', 'not', 'offer', 'choice', 'picking', 'given', 'track', 'have', 'skip', 'forward', 'manually', 'not', 'end', 'world', 'piano', 'Bosendorfer', 'concert', 'grand', 'wonderful', 'sound', 'DVD', 'packaged', 'non-standard', 'DVD', 'case', 'thinner', 'usual', 'adequate.Okay', 'have', 'say', 'few', 'words', 'theme', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'whole', 'pink', 'dress/black', 'dress', 'thing', 'Somehow', 'find', 'such', 'gimics', 'rather', 'insulting', 'prestige', 'artist', 'was', 'artist', 'idea', 'guess', 'okay', 'respect', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'was', 'goofy', 'vehicle', 'part', 'DVD', 'producer', 'please', 'more', 'Concert', 'pianists', 'are', 'not', 'show', 'dogs', 'Nobody', 'Murray', 'Perahia', 'Alfred', 'Brendel', 'dress', 'artificial', 'costumes', 'let', 'extend', 'same', 'respect', 'female', 'artists', 'Market', 'DVD', 'based', 'music', 'not', 'dress', 'Okay', 'high', 'horse.So', 'like', 'fast', 'brilliant', 'effortless', 'piano', 'playing', ""'ll"", 'like', 'disc', 'like', 'performances', 'nuance', 'drama', 'real', 'feeling', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'here', 'exception', 'Rachmaninoff', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'pianist', 'recording', 'Chopin', 'Etudes', 'very', 'fine', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'DVD', 'recording', 'Liszt', 'transcriptions', 'songs', 'Schubert', 'Schwanengesang', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'playing', 'chess', 'so', 'few', 'women', 'play']",Black and Pink
