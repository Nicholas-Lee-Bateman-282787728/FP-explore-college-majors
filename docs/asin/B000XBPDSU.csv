None of the required elements to make a good movie even came close to sneaking into this one.  The movie drags and drags through alternate haunted infirmary then police interview, back and forth incessantly.  It flips back and forth so often that the entire story flow is destroyed. Further, there's no horror.  Its at least 40 minutes into the movie before anything even remotely interesting happens, far too long.  The acting is terrible.  The interrogating cop, for example, should never set foot on a film set again.  Avoid at all costs.",1,Very poorly done,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,645,"['sad', 'example', 'movie', 'had', 'rhythm', 'pace', 'storytelling', 'engaging', 'acting/characters', 'None', 'required', 'elements', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'sneaking', 'one', 'movie', 'drags', 'drags', 'alternate', 'haunted', 'infirmary', 'then', 'police', 'interview', 'back', 'forth', 'incessantly', 'back', 'forth', 'so', 'often', 'entire', 'story', 'flow', 'destroyed', 'Further', 'horror', 'least', '40', 'minutes', 'movie', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'happens', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'acting', 'terrible', 'interrogating', 'cop', 'example', 'should', 'never', 'set', 'foot', 'film', 'set', 'again', 'Avoid', 'costs']",The Expedition

A group of Canadians go to an abandoned institution to investigate it.  Then they don't.  Literally.  They drive 8 hours to get to this place only to be told that it isn't haunted, so they leave.  They come back to meet with an eyewitness to the non haunting. Who walks them through the building and tells them of his own non experience.  So they leave again and rent a cheap motel room for a nap.  About 4 PM they come back and film for a while.  Then the film starts with the next morning.  They have spent the night sleeping in the place because they couldn't investigate with cops and kids running around the place.  This is told to us, no evidence thereof.  They wake up at 11 AM and one of them is missing.  The next hour is spent yelling 'Tom', Tom, where are you.  and running around like headless Canadian chickens.  Every little while a camera would fuzz out, (apparently the 'ghosts' affect all of there cameras with exactly the same moir&eacute; pattern.  Eventually they call it quits and the credits roll.  That is the entire movie.  I spent two hours of my live enduring this.  There was no acting except poor acting.  Monotonous music.  That would build to a crescendo and nothing would happen.  Poor sound, I kept trying to get closed captioning.

DO NOT RENT IT, unless you just want to see the Blair Witch movies in slightly different clothes.  Let's put it this way - if a soda company made a cola with the identical recipe to Coca Cola, they would be sued for infringement, right?  Well, consider THIS video to be that soda company, and BLAIR WITCH I & II to be Coca Cola.Let's compare - Blair Witch vs. The Expedition:  the premise of the movie being a group of kids setting out to determine if a place is haunted?  Yes.  Claims the movie is made up in large part of actual footage shot by the kids?  Yup.  First scenes of two of the kids videotaping each other and making silly comments about it?  Yes. Upon arrival at the location, interview locals about whether the place is haunted?  Of course.Now, lest you think there was some originality... let's compare the other scenes to Blair Witch II!  Opens with a kid being interrogated by the police over being responsible for the deaths of the others?  Yes. Repeated interviews with same to reveal the plot line?  Yup.And it just goes on and on... so won't bore you with any more of the details.
