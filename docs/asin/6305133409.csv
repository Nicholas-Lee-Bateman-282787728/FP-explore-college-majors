This, one of two high points of the movie, takes place in a cemetery at night, with the hillbillies (armed with axes, shot guns and knives) creeping toward the uneasy crooks (with automatic rifles) who are hiding behind grave stones. The other highlight is Liam Neeson. He plays Briar Gates, a big, tough, smart hillbilly whose little brother was murdered by members of the gang. Neeson does hillbilly really well. When he's on screen he carries the movie.The star, however, is Patrick Swayze as Truman Gates, a Chicago cop who left his Appalachian family to better himself. Briar is his big brother. Truman wants to take care of the killers the police way. Briar says, no...we'll do it the family way...blood for blood. Justice triumphs. Along the way we see some actors early in their movie careers...Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Ben Stiller, Ted Levine, and others...Adam Baldwin, Michael J. Pollard. We also have a lengthy slice of Appalachian country life when Truman Gates and his wife visit his family. Look closely and you'll see that wonderful folk singer, Jean Ritchie, as Truman's aunt.

450861,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,6305133409,DarthJustice,"[1, 1]","Next of Kin follows Truman Gates, a Chicago cop from Kentucky. One of his brothers is murdered by the nearly psychotic nephew of a local Mob boss during a truck hijacking. Long story short, Truman's older brother Briar (Liam Neeson) comes up to Chicago wanting mountain family style revenge. Truman does his best to keep his brother restrained and for the police to handle it. Ultimately, a disgruntled Truman resigns and joins his family in getting justice served their own way.In addition to Swayze and Neeson, the movie also stars Adam Baldwin, Helen Hunt, and a young then-24 year old Ben Stiller. Liam Neeson as Briar was pretty good. Other than Swayze, Neeson gave a very good performance. Briar gave off an air of wanting to just let loose on the people he wanted to get back at but wanting to listen to his brother at the same. It was also interesting seeing Ben Stiller play a more serious straightforward character as the son of the local organized crime boss.The DVD itself is pretty basic. There's no special features to speak of. Though in its defense, the DVD was released not too long after DVDs really started hitting the shelves in the late 90s and was not an uncommon sight at the time for no special features to be included.It's a fairly decent action movie though it also deals with Truman and his family's interaction (most notably his older brother). Not an explosion after explosion Die-Hard kind of action movie, but a bit more subtle.All in all, Next of Kin is definitely a Patrick Swayze movie worth seeing. It's too bad that this movie seems to be so underrated and forgotten. I actually had never heard of the movie myself until last year when I saw it in Wal-Mart. I've always liked Patrick Swayze so I decided to buy it.

Co-starring Liam Neeson(Taken, Taken 2) Oscar-winner Helen Hunt(As Good as it Gets, Mad About You) and Ben Stiller(Zoolander, Dodgeball), Next of Kin tells the story of Gates(Swayze), his older brother(Neeson) and their relatives from the backwoods of Kentucky, seeking revenge for the murder of Gates' little brother at the hands of the Chicago mafia.

How else can a movie with Patrick Swayze, Liam Neeson, Bill Paxton, Ben Stiller, Helen Hunt, and a Baldwin brother - it doesn't matter which one - be so obscure?!From deep in the Appalachia country, Truman Gates (Swayze) emerges for the bright lights of Chicago where he becomes a police officer.  Tagging along is screw-up, younger brother Gerald (Paxton), whose southern naivety gets him in trouble, and ultimately killed by mobster Joey Rosselini (Baldwin).  Joined by his brother Briar (Neesom) in some sort of twisted Wyatt Earp tale, Truman melds his big city skills and country knowledge while seeking vengeance for Gerald.  If it weren't set in a city the size of Chicago, there is almost a little Hatfield & McCoy in there.  In fact, I would have enjoyed this film infinitesimally more if the brothers' surname were either Hatfield or McCoy.While there isn't much subtlety to the film, there is a decent portrayal of the contrast between city and country life.  Even back country, Appalachian life, where opossum is not just road-kill, but hearty vittles.  The film's score accentuates the divide, with finely tuned pianos battling dulcimers and washboards for screen-time.  Equally juxtaposing is the actual scenery.  High rises versus hollers.Ultimately a viewer has to decide if the showdown between city and country is worth the time.

450874,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,6305133409,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[58, 63]","In terms of just pure plot, Next of Kin is -- in many ways -- a typical example of the unconventional cop vs. the mob film genre of the 1980s...However, if Next of Kin is ultimately a genre piece, its still a better-than-average example of the what the genre is capable of.  Certainly, its probably the only film ever made by Patrick Swayze that can legitimately be called underrated.Plotwise, the film sounds almost like a parody.  Patrick Swayze is a former hillbilly from Appalacia Country who has left behind his rustic family to become a big city cop and to romance sophisticated music teacher Helen Hunt.  (Is there a reason why big city cops with simple backgrounds always seem to end up romancing music teacers in these films?)  Swayze's younger brother Bill Paxton also comes to the city, to pursue a life of petty crime that ends up getting him killed by mobster Adam Baldwin which leads to yet another Swayze brother coming down to the city, this one played by Liam Neeson.  As Neeson seeks revenge, Swayze is forced to return to his roots in order to avenge both his brother and protect his girlfriend.Yet somehow, all of this works rather effectively on screen.  The film is directed by Englishman John Irvin who has made a rather unsung career out of bringing a stronger-than-usual sense of characterization to genre films (the best example being the war film Hamburger Hill).  Although Irvin's filming of the action scenes are a little pedestrian, he still has a strong visual sense and manages to vividly contrast the conflicting worlds of the country and the city.  The film's supporting cast is well chosen and both the heroes and the villians all come to life with a surprising amount of dignity.  At no point do any of the actors demean their roles by playing ...typical hillybillys or, for that matter, ...typical mobsters and that shows an unusual and admirable amount of integrity for a film of this sort.  Paxton isn't on screen long but remains, as always, a likeable presence and Adam Baldwin makes a compellingly understandable and hissable villian.  Michael J. Pollard shows up as a hillbilly and brings his trademark quirkiness to the proceedings while the role of the nerdy mob scion is played by Ben Stiller, of all people.  Its a little jarring to see Stiller show up on screen (especially playing an essentially villianous role) yet he gives a strong performance without resorting to do any standard Stiller bits.  Helen Hunt's role is ...typical but she's probably far warmer in this role than she's been in any of her prestige pictures.  Certainly, the best performance in the film is given by Liam Neeson who dominates the proceedings with the grim sincerity he brings to his quest for revenge.  This Irish actor also manages to perfectly capture the unique accent of the Appalacian region.  As an actor, Patrick Swayze has always been limited and he's always been better at projecting sincerity than complexity.  Luckily, his role in Next of Kin has been designed to require little more of him than sincerity and, if Next of Kin doesn't represent his best performance, its certainly his most likeable.Next of Kin isn't a great film.  As stated before, the story is a tad bit too predictable and that's only made more obvious when the story is populated by a better-than-average cast and directed by a truly talented director.  However, this is a rare genre piece in which it is obvious that everyone involved actually put in their best efforts to make a worthwhile film and the results are both admirable and entertaining.",3,Underrated,1019088000,"04 18, 2002",2002,3559,"['terms', 'just', 'pure', 'plot', 'Next', 'Kin', 'many', 'ways', 'typical', 'example', 'unconventional', 'cop', 'mob', 'film', 'genre', '1980s', 'However', 'Next', 'Kin', 'ultimately', 'genre', 'piece', 'still', 'better-than-average', 'example', 'what', 'genre', 'capable', 'Certainly', 'probably', 'only', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'can', 'legitimately', 'be', 'called', 'underrated.Plotwise', 'film', 'almost', 'parody', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'former', 'hillbilly', 'Appalacia', 'Country', 'who', 'left', 'rustic', 'family', 'become', 'big', 'city', 'cop', 'romance', 'sophisticated', 'music', 'teacher', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'there', 'reason', 'why', 'big', 'city', 'cops', 'simple', 'backgrounds', 'always', 'seem', 'end', 'up', 'romancing', 'music', 'teacers', 'films', 'Swayze', 'younger', 'brother', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'also', 'city', 'pursue', 'life', 'petty', 'crime', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'mobster', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'yet', 'Swayze', 'brother', 'coming', 'down', 'city', 'one', 'played', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Neeson', 'revenge', 'Swayze', 'forced', 'return', 'roots', 'order', 'avenge', 'brother', 'protect', 'girlfriend.Yet', 'somehow', 'rather', 'effectively', 'screen', 'film', 'directed', 'Englishman', 'John', 'Irvin', 'who', 'made', 'rather', 'unsung', 'career', 'bringing', 'stronger-than-usual', 'sense', 'characterization', 'genre', 'films', 'best', 'example', 'being', 'war', 'film', 'Hamburger', 'Hill', 'Irvin', 'filming', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'pedestrian', 'still', 'strong', 'visual', 'sense', 'manages', 'vividly', 'contrast', 'conflicting', 'worlds', 'country', 'city', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'well', 'chosen', 'heroes', 'villians', 'come', 'life', 'surprising', 'amount', 'dignity', 'point', 'do', 'actors', 'demean', 'roles', 'playing', 'typical', 'hillybillys', 'matter', 'typical', 'mobsters', 'unusual', 'admirable', 'amount', 'integrity', 'film', 'sort', 'Paxton', ""n't"", 'screen', 'long', 'always', 'likeable', 'presence', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'compellingly', 'understandable', 'hissable', 'villian', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Pollard', 'up', 'hillbilly', 'trademark', 'quirkiness', 'proceedings', 'role', 'nerdy', 'mob', 'scion', 'played', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'people', 'little', 'jarring', 'see', 'Stiller', 'show', 'up', 'screen', 'especially', 'playing', 'essentially', 'villianous', 'role', 'yet', 'strong', 'performance', 'resorting', 'do', 'standard', 'Stiller', 'bits', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'role', 'typical', 'probably', 'far', 'warmer', 'role', 'been', 'prestige', 'pictures', 'Certainly', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'given', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'proceedings', 'grim', 'sincerity', 'quest', 'revenge', 'Irish', 'actor', 'also', 'perfectly', 'capture', 'unique', 'accent', 'Appalacian', 'region', 'actor', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'always', 'been', 'limited', 'always', 'been', 'better', 'projecting', 'sincerity', 'complexity', 'Luckily', 'role', 'Next', 'Kin', 'been', 'designed', 'require', 'little', 'more', 'sincerity', 'Next', 'Kin', ""n't"", 'represent', 'best', 'performance', 'certainly', 'most', 'likeable.Next', 'Kin', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'stated', 'story', 'tad', 'bit', 'too', 'predictable', 'only', 'made', 'more', 'obvious', 'when', 'story', 'populated', 'better-than-average', 'cast', 'directed', 'truly', 'talented', 'director', 'However', 'rare', 'genre', 'piece', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'involved', 'actually', 'put', 'best', 'efforts', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'results', 'are', 'admirable', 'entertaining']",N/A

Yes, this is a revenge flick, but the acting is so strong that you have to forgive the somewhat predictable plot.The cast is stellar. Here's Ben Stiller as the son of a Mafia don in one of his first roles. Here's Helen Hunt as Swayze's wife (this is a nice touch--in many of these kind of films, the hero cop is a loner; having him married to somebody like Helen Hunt is a good move). Here's Liam Neeson in a relatively quiet role--but when he does speak, you can feel it straight up your spine, oh yes. And here's Bill Paxton as the ill-fated brother of Truman Gates, another rock solid performance.

Gerald (Truman's brother) wasn't doing anything illegal, he worked for a company with vending machines who were targeted by the Chicago mob for takeover--he got caught in a takeover mob killing. And Truman's (Swayze) brother's name was Briar (so typically mountain)--not Blair. And a reviewer wondered how Briar (Neeson) knew Chicago so well since he had never been there--Briar clearly states at Gerald's funeral he HAS been to Chicago and didn't like it, he returned home to Ky.--so that's why he knew his way around town.  Both Neeson and Swayze do a great job in expressing the culture of the ""hills"" versus the Chicago life. Helen Hunt is good as Truman's (Swayze) wife. The scenes of the hills when Truman takes Gerald's body home for burial is so true to life, the snake bus, the relatives and their desire to settle things their way, the houses (and Briar's old RV-home), the deer head in the refrigerator and the scenes of the hill country--just exactly the way it is.Truman has gone to Chicago to make himself a better life.  He's still a ""mountain boy"" at heart but his family back in the hills are as real as it gets.  Gerald, the younger brother, has followed him to Chicago to make some money to buy a coal truck and return back to Kentucky.  Also, for any who might know ""mountain music"", Truman, Gerald and Briar's mother is played by Jean Ritchie, one of the most famous and best of the traditional mountain dulcimer players and song writers in the business. It was a treat to see her in the role of Mom. This is a great movie, so very underrated, great acting, good story line, good paring of actors with intensity.  Swayze is great as usual, Neeson can't be beat, his accent is perfect as is his look for this movie.I loved the response (as my subject line) Truman made when he was called to a seedy hotel to get a ""mountain boy"" involved in a murder to surrender--Truman knew Chicago as a Chicago cop--and he knew the mentality of the mountain culture--an eye for an eye and you settle your differences yourself. There were a number of great one-liners in this movie--some I particularly liked were Swayze's ""enticement"" to Helen Hunt for a little romp upstairs, ""do you believe in the hereafter, then you know what I'm here after"" and ""wanna play on my teetertotter""--too funny.The music was great in this movie, a little culture and a lot of country.

Reenter those wonderful unforgettable days of ole for this piece of underrated southern fried vengeance and mayhem action flick starring mullet hero Patrick Swayze and a then largely unknown Liam Neeson, who sets the groundwork for his future metamorphosis from Oscar nominated actor to 21st century Charles Bronson, here.Directed by John Irvin, a maverick of the underrated action movie with credits like the Dogs of War and the superior Schwarzenegger vehicle Raw Deal, Swayze stars as Truman Gates, a reformed hillbilly turned windy city cop. When mobsters kill his little brother (Bill Paxton), he finds himself torn between ""what he should have done and what has to be done."" So enter his estranged older brother, Briar (Neeson), the kind of Appalachian who keeps a severed deer's head in his fridge next to his beer. Briar comes to the big city looking for the men responsible and more than willing to stomp a few creeps to get some answers. Truman, unsuccessfully attempts to keep him on a leash, but soon finds himself drawn into the dark side of vengeance too.Not nearly as giddy silly as the much loved Swayze starrer cult classic Road House. Still, Next of Kin offers plenty to recommend like an awesome showdown in a cemetery, amiable characters, funny cheesy dialogue, and a great role for cult character actor Michael J. Pollard as the proprietor of a flophouse who gets the film's single funniest line (""Hell, no. I'd shoot somebody"").Having never looked better than on the new Blu-ray release with it's 1:85:1 high definition transfer, it easily replaces the poor quality budget pan & scan DVD from years ago. Featuring a stunning cast of actors who would continue to various levels of stardom, not just Neeson and Paxton, but also a never lovelier future Oscar Winner Helen Hunt, Adam Baldwin (Serenity) as the chief heavy, a young Ben Stiller as a mobster flunky and Ted Levine (""Monk"") .Next of Kin is not as well known as many of the other actioners of it's day, but it is one of the best. As expected there are plot holes, inconsistencies and plenty of good old clich&eacute;s, but it's also a lot of fun and an agreeable time waster.

Although the plot has been somewhat rehashed many times the performances here stir emotion.  Especially Liam Neeson's.  If not for his performance in this movie I probably would have given it 4 stars, but he shines brightly here.  The loyalty and love of his character combined with the contempt and anger of his character, what a great performance.When this movie first came out I didn't even know it.
