This film is much more modernized, with clean, smooth, hypnotic shots. One could say that it is even visually appealing. To top it off, it has strong emotions (certainly enough to overpower ""Death Wish""). The beating scene is particuarly brutal and sad.

1125386,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0010HOZVW,Andrew Ellington,"[11, 12]","As some have mentioned, this story has been told before.  It's been told plenty of times to be more exact.  The lack of originality aside though, `The Brave One' still delivers on quite a few levels and manages to leave the audience satisfied.  In fact I'm a little stunned at the critical beating this movie took.  Some critics made this out to be so terrible that I almost stayed away entirely.  I've never been a real fan of Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard just irritates me to no end so really the film had no draw on me to begin with; and then the critics attacked and so I was left with absolutely no reason to give it a chance.  Then I found myself alone and bored with nothing to do but watch TV and the only movie on Pay-Per-View I hadn't seen was `The Brave One'.I will say this first and foremost; both Foster and Howard have never, and I mean NEVER, impressed me more than in this film.  They are the beating heart here, the reason upon all reasons to give this movie a chance.  Especially Foster, but I'll get to her in a minute.  Howard really sunk into his role and pulled up every ounce of his characters vulnerability.  I remember back in 2005 when Howard starred in `Crash' and `Hustle & Flow' and everyone was singing his praises as the next big thing.  I remember so well because I didn't get it.  His performance in `Crash' was choppy and uneven, a little forced even and his performance in `Hustle & Flow' was decent but to me it ended up being 70% hype and 30% delivery.  Here I actually saw what everyone had been claiming to see for so long.  Here I finally saw him shine.`The Brave One' tells the tragic story of Erica Bain, a middle-aged woman about to be married to the man of her dreams when she and her fianc&eacute; are brutally attacked and their dream is shattered.  Her fianc&eacute; dies as a result of the attack and she is critically injured.  Upon recovery she realizes that she is no longer the person she once was.  She is trapped in this shell of fear and pain that engulfs all that she does, every decision she makes and ultimately shapes the person she will soon become.  Her first step was buying a gun, a gun she initially purchased to protect herself from the very people she now feared so much but that gun soon led her down a path she didn't know was going to be presented to her.Jodie Foster has been a critically praised actress for years now.  She's won two Academy Awards for her performances in `The Accused' and `The Silence of the Lambs'.  She's been considered one of our greatest actresses for quite some time but it wasn't until I saw this film that I understood why.  I actually thought that Foster was overrated.  She utterly blew me away here.  This is by far her finest performance and to me is one of the best performances of this year, period.  Her fragility, her vulnerability but most importantly her strength help elevate this character so much.  There's a scene where she returns to work for the first time after the attack and she's struggling to talk, struggling to put herself out there and then all of a sudden a clicks.  Her voice deepens, her eyes squint, her face tightens and in those few moments I was spellbound by her brilliance.  She was captivating.`The Brave One' is not the best film out there.  It suffers from some clich&eacute;s and a lack of originality but it has two very strong performances in its corner to help it survive.  Despite its flaws it never falls apart or loses our interest.  Foster commands every scene she embodies and carries this film straight on through to its closing.  Put aside the fact that you've seen this plot unravel before and embrace the electric performances that embody the soul of this film.",4,Bravely goes where many films have gone before but still manages to be well worth the ride...,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,3713,"['have', 'mentioned', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'been', 'told', 'plenty', 'times', 'be', 'more', 'exact', 'lack', 'originality', 'aside', 'Brave', 'One', 'still', 'delivers', 'few', 'levels', 'manages', 'leave', 'audience', 'satisfied', 'fact', ""'m"", 'little', 'stunned', 'critical', 'beating', 'movie', 'took', 'critics', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'terrible', 'almost', 'stayed', 'away', 'entirely', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'real', 'fan', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'just', 'end', 'so', 'really', 'film', 'had', 'draw', 'begin', 'then', 'critics', 'attacked', 'so', 'was', 'left', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'give', 'chance', 'Then', 'found', 'alone', 'bored', 'nothing', 'do', 'watch', 'TV', 'only', 'movie', 'Pay-Per-View', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'Brave', ""One'.I"", 'will', 'say', 'first', 'foremost', 'Foster', 'Howard', 'have', 'never', 'mean', 'NEVER', 'impressed', 'more', 'film', 'are', 'beating', 'heart', 'here', 'reason', 'reasons', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'Especially', 'Foster', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute', 'Howard', 'really', 'role', 'pulled', 'up', 'ounce', 'characters', 'vulnerability', 'remember', 'back', '2005', 'when', 'Howard', 'starred', 'Crash', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'everyone', 'was', 'singing', 'praises', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'remember', 'so', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'performance', 'Crash', 'was', 'choppy', 'uneven', 'little', 'forced', 'even', 'performance', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'was', 'decent', 'ended', 'up', 'being', '70', '%', 'hype', '30', '%', 'delivery', 'Here', 'actually', 'saw', 'what', 'everyone', 'had', 'been', 'claiming', 'see', 'so', 'long', 'Here', 'finally', 'saw', 'shine.', 'Brave', 'One', 'tragic', 'story', 'Erica', 'Bain', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'be', 'married', 'man', 'dreams', 'when', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'are', 'brutally', 'attacked', 'dream', 'shattered', 'Her', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'result', 'attack', 'critically', 'injured', 'recovery', 'no', 'longer', 'person', 'once', 'was', 'trapped', 'shell', 'fear', 'pain', 'decision', 'ultimately', 'person', 'will', 'soon', 'become', 'first', 'step', 'was', 'buying', 'gun', 'gun', 'initially', 'purchased', 'protect', 'very', 'people', 'now', 'feared', 'so', 'much', 'gun', 'soon', 'led', 'down', 'path', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'presented', 'her.Jodie', 'Foster', 'been', 'critically', 'praised', 'actress', 'years', 'now', 'won', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'performances', 'Accused', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'been', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'quite', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'saw', 'film', 'understood', 'why', 'actually', 'thought', 'Foster', 'was', 'overrated', 'utterly', 'blew', 'away', 'here', 'far', 'finest', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'year', 'period', 'fragility', 'vulnerability', 'most', 'importantly', 'strength', 'help', 'elevate', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'scene', 'where', 'work', 'first', 'time', 'attack', 'struggling', 'talk', 'struggling', 'put', 'there', 'then', 'sudden', 'clicks', 'voice', 'deepens', 'eyes', 'squint', 'face', 'tightens', 'few', 'moments', 'was', 'spellbound', 'brilliance', 'was', 'captivating.', 'Brave', 'One', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'there', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'lack', 'originality', 'two', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'corner', 'help', 'survive', 'flaws', 'never', 'apart', 'interest', 'Foster', 'scene', 'film', 'straight', 'closing', 'Put', 'aside', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plot', 'unravel', 'embrace', 'electric', 'performances', 'embody', 'soul', 'film']",N/A

What a horrendous mistake that would have been. I mean--guys--did we see the same film???This is not your typical vigilante thriller-- It's much, much more. JodieFoster is(again)phenomenal. I believe she and Meryl Streep are the two greatest American actresses ever. Foster is blisteringly tough, heartbreaking, vulnerable, and guilt ridden, all rolled up into one. Her performance should win her another Academy Award come Oscar time. There is one scene in particular that comes to mind. She and Terrence Howard(also very good) are having lunch. His character(police detective) reveals the investigation of the vigilante may be coming to a close when one more piece of evidence is found. Ms. Foster's facial expression reveals guilt, sadness, rage, and fear all at the same time without her uttering a single word. Very few actresses can pull this off--but Ms. Foster seems to do it effortlessly. She had me at the point of tears several times during the film.  BRAVO Ms. Foster.Now for the critics who had all negative things to say about the film--especially the ending. If you are pro-capital punishment--you will LOVE the movie---especially the ending.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I was hoping The Brave One would live up to the hype of being an incredible edge of your seat thriller/drama, but it didn't happen *quite* as amazingly as I'd hoped.  Instead it was a merely good enough film that offered just enough action and excitement to give it a passable rating.It's about Jodie Foster and her boyfriend finding themselves walking directly into a gang of dangerous thugs one night unbeknownst to them, leaving the boyfriend dead and Jodie's face badly damaged.  So what happens you may be wondering?  Why, Jodie not only plans her revenge on the bad guys who committed the act of heartless violence, but as a result of those thugs being responsible for ruining her life (hence the bleak environment, illustrating Jodie's new perception of the world) she has nothing but vengeful intentions towards *anyone* that stands in her way.Quite often Jodie finds herself in situations where her life is in danger (talk about incredibly unlucky, unless she's living in the most dangerous city on the planet).  She then has to use her nifty little gun to fire off deadly shots at the bad guys who'd mess with her and trust me, they'd mess with her frequently in places such as the subway, convenience store, park, etc.  Now, if she had to use a gun as often in real life as she does here, I'd strongly consider moving out of THAT dangerous city as quickly as possible.  It wasn't believable in the sense that one woman would be forced to persevere so much unrelated violence.I think another thing I didn't like was the whole ""radio show"" bits that would creep in every now and then.  Jodie works at a radio show, so whenever Jodie interviewed someone for her show, it would immediately take away from all the excitement and suspense that the storyline presented so well just a moment before, and make it as boring as possible.  This happens on quite a few occasions, however any downtime you might notice with the storyline flow becomes significantly better during the final 30 minutes when you as a viewer can sense a showdown of sorts is about to get underway.  Terrence Howard is the second most popular character in the movie.  He plays a sympathetic cop, and his communication with Jodie's character is really good.However, Jodie Foster is flat out *awesome* in this movie.  She's one of the best actresses doing movies in my opinion.  Always has been, in fact.  She can become whatever kind of character the movie writers ask of her.  Not just anyone can do that (at least, not believably).  She's multi-talented.

In THE BRAVE ONE, she takes on the role of radio-personality turned vigilante w/ ease and cool lethality. At first, I thought this was going to be some sort of DEATH WISH re-tread. Nope, TBO is a story about the ultimate cost of revenge. The toll that vengeance takes on the avenger in the form of a new inner deadness and freezing of one's own soul. While the scumbags who get their due are certainly deserving of their fate, Erica must go deeper into the abyss w/ each execution. The price of becoming an angel of death is extremely high. Ms. Foster brings authenticity and anguish to the part of Erica Bain.

As a Jodie fan for some 30+ years (I fell in love w/ her character in The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane back in the 70s), I consider this to be one of her best performances.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 0]","Certain parallels between Charles Bronson'sDeath Wishand THE BRAVE ONE have undoubtedly already been drawn, and rightfully so. Both focus on vigilante justice by a man (or woman) who was wronged by thugs. But herein lay the ONLY similarity, making The Brave One a somewhat unique animal.What drove Bronson's Paul Kersey character was anger, whereas Jodi Foster's Erica Bain is driven by fear after a brutal attack in a New York park that leaves her fianc&eacute; David (Naveen Andrews,Lost TV Series) dead and herself in a coma for weeks.Erica, a well-known radio personality, has to try and get her life back on track, but fear of everything infringes upon her every wish. Walking down hallways make her dizzy, and going out at night is out of the question. Upon returning to work she finds she can hardly breath and confides much to her boss Carol (Mary Steenburgen,The Dead Girl). Coming to terms with her fear, Erica purchases an illegal handgun and, after finding herself near another person who's violence dismayed her, kills someone with her new gun. Her hand is steady. She doesn't shake. Her life of fear is changing into...something else.A path of vigilante deaths get the cops involved and Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard,Hustle & Flow) is on the case. He's also involved in trying to solve the murder of Erica's fianc&eacute; and the two form an unusual relationship based on suspicion and the dichotomy of right versus legalities. Their interplay is unique and tenuous as the two learn more about each other and come to a mutual form of respect ...and perhaps much more.Those similarities I mentioned at the beginning are now sorely lost. Mainly because Bronson's Paul Kersey (a man and the stereotype for vigilantism) and Foster's Erica Bain (a woman and not a stereotype) are in different ballparks. Kersey did it for revenge from the get-go, while Bain's in initially about how to deal with her fear, but later becomes a convoluted form of animalistic revenge. The damage she's doing to herself are felt within the character and not from without. Her realization that she ""doesn't tremble"" when she kills someone is both unsettling and comforting. That she gets better and better at killing is equally so.The biggest problem with the film, however, is that it initially sets Terrence Howard's Detective Mercer up as a very good and forthright cop, but in the end he is anything but that. He crosses the line between right and legally right with exceptional ease, which kind of ruined the ending for me; too simplistic for such a complex man.But nothing can be taken away from Jodi Foster (Inside Man). Still plugging along after all these years, she's still able to carry a film's weight with grace, honor and sheer terror.A worthy evening diversion for those interested in the genre.",3,The Sour Taste Of Revenge...,1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,2802,"['Certain', 'parallels', 'Charles', ""Bronson'sDeath"", 'Wishand', 'THE', 'BRAVE', 'ONE', 'have', 'undoubtedly', 'already', 'been', 'drawn', 'rightfully', 'so', 'focus', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'wronged', 'thugs', 'herein', 'lay', 'ONLY', 'similarity', 'making', 'Brave', 'One', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'animal.What', 'drove', 'Bronson', 'Paul', 'Kersey', 'character', 'was', 'anger', 'whereas', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'Erica', 'Bain', 'driven', 'fear', 'brutal', 'attack', 'New', 'York', 'park', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'David', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Lost', 'TV', 'Series', 'dead', 'coma', 'weeks.Erica', 'well-known', 'radio', 'personality', 'try', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'fear', 'everything', 'infringes', 'wish', 'Walking', 'down', 'hallways', 'make', 'dizzy', 'going', 'out', 'night', 'question', 'returning', 'work', 'can', 'hardly', 'breath', 'confides', 'much', 'boss', 'Carol', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Dead', 'Girl', 'Coming', 'terms', 'fear', 'Erica', 'purchases', 'illegal', 'handgun', 'finding', 'person', 'who', 'violence', 'dismayed', 'someone', 'new', 'gun', 'hand', 'steady', ""n't"", 'shake', 'life', 'fear', 'changing', 'something', 'else.A', 'path', 'vigilante', 'deaths', 'get', 'cops', 'involved', 'Detective', 'Mercer', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'case', 'also', 'involved', 'trying', 'solve', 'murder', 'Erica', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'two', 'form', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'based', 'suspicion', 'dichotomy', 'right', 'versus', 'legalities', 'interplay', 'unique', 'tenuous', 'two', 'learn', 'more', 'other', 'come', 'mutual', 'form', 'respect', 'perhaps', 'much', 'more.Those', 'similarities', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'are', 'now', 'sorely', 'lost', 'Mainly', 'Bronson', 'Paul', 'Kersey', 'man', 'stereotype', 'vigilantism', 'Foster', 'Erica', 'Bain', 'woman', 'not', 'stereotype', 'are', 'different', 'ballparks', 'Kersey', 'did', 'revenge', 'get-go', 'Bain', 'initially', 'how', 'deal', 'fear', 'later', 'convoluted', 'form', 'animalistic', 'revenge', 'damage', 'doing', 'are', 'felt', 'character', 'not', 'realization', ""n't"", 'tremble', 'when', 'someone', 'unsettling', 'comforting', 'better', 'better', 'killing', 'equally', 'so.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'however', 'initially', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Detective', 'Mercer', 'up', 'very', 'good', 'forthright', 'cop', 'end', 'anything', 'line', 'right', 'legally', 'right', 'exceptional', 'ease', 'kind', 'ruined', 'ending', 'too', 'simplistic', 'such', 'complex', 'man.But', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'Inside', 'Man', 'Still', 'plugging', 'along', 'years', 'still', 'able', 'carry', 'film', 'weight', 'grace', 'honor', 'sheer', 'terror.A', 'worthy', 'evening', 'diversion', 'interested', 'genre']",N/A

I knew exactly how the movie was going to end long before it did.The radio narrative's Jodie Foster's character gave in the movie fell short as well. The idea was fine, the words were fine, the acting was fine, but the effect they were trying to produce never quite formed. It seemed forced. The entire movie seemed like they tried too hard, it wasn't natural.The movie did not build on itself. You would see one relatively dramatic scene that would kindle your interest, and next would be a clumsy and bland scene that would deflate all the drama that had just been developed. It all seemed a little shallow, forced, predictable, and I hate to say it, slightly boring.What I felt about The Brave One kind of reminded me of what I felt about the movie ""A History of Violence"". I had high hopes for that movie, especially since it had Ed Harris in it. And although all the scenes he was in were very good, the movie itself turned out be a little odd and basically uninteresting.Check it out.

1125410,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0010HOZVW,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 1]","I sometimes get dubious of these kind of films: these ""message"" films where it'll try to take good, hard looks at a certain societal problem and try to examine why it is we do what we do or why things are the way they are. Problem is they are good films with a message but there's not a good enough film attached to it to really elevate it or it's just a good film whenever you put it on and whether you'd even put it on sometime in the near future or even remember it is another problem. While it does have very solid acting all around, it does have nagging problems in its script, rather unbelievable scenes and events and a rather inappropriate ending given its tone.Erica Bain is a radio host who walks the streets of New York City, recording its sounds and waxing poetic about the ever-changing atmosphere and the stories within it. Happily engaged to doctor David, her life completely hits bottom when, out walking their dog, they're brutally attacked leaving Erica out for three weeks while David dies from his injuries. Grieving and shaken, Erica can't seem to function much anymore and buys a gun to feel more secure but when she kills a robber who murdered the store clerk, Erica becomes a different person and fears who that is while giving in to it anyway.Detective Mercer is investigating the victims in Erica's wake where her actions speak of a vigilante who takes down the criminals cops don't have the manpower or time for. Mercer is not content at letting people take the matter into his own hands but with Erica becoming interested in the investigation, Mercer can grow ever more suspicious about Erica's involvement and their developing friendship.The film in the end has 2 messages: does it make it right to stop crime by righting the wrongs the wrong way and do we really understand who we are if not given the opportunity to find out. Like a lot of films, the premise and moral uncertainties end up being more interesting than the film that deals with them since the film, as impeccably made as it is, just falls into pitfalls it shouldn't. A cute radio host literally does not get anything resembling violence towards her the whole time she's lived in New York and one incident has her practically attacked on a weekly basis? Or the useless Mercer partner character? Or Erica's art gallery friend that is literally in 2 scenes? Or its tonally wrong ending which essentially shoots down any moral debates it was generating? It's things like this that drag the film down.That being said, at least the film has some great acting and Jodie Foster always manages to bring gravitas into a role even if it wasn't required in the first place (like, I don't know...Panic Room? Flightplan?) While she is given some bad B-movie dialogue during her Superwoman scenes, it's the struggle and humanity that seems to diminish is where her talent comes through. Also delivering solid work is Terrance Howard who helps flesh out a character that could've easily have been some speaking-wisdom-from-the-podium type role where he's just there to clarify that the world can indeed suck from time to time. Unneeded though is Nicky Katt who basically plays the wisecracking partner and is simply somebody Mercer can talk to in crime scenes without having to talk to himself (which to be honest, Howard could probably pull off).Awhile ago, I rented a movie for my mom which she quite liked when she first saw it. A recent trip to the video store, she came across the same movie and asked whether or not we saw it. Me having a good memory, I said yes and mom looked at me like ""huh...weird I don't remember"".

She sees where she is and what it all means, all meshed together with crime and business and love and affection and affliction and power and fun and beauty. She can see and see well. Or can she? After the unfortunate event that lays the story's foundation, ERICA has a frightening epiphany. Despite her private belief of strength and superiority, she finds that she is no safer than anyone else. But rather than join a support group, take to the bottle, cry herself to sleep or barricade herself inside her apartment, she decides to do what few others do. She decides to fight back.Even though the police do excellent work, solve countless crimes and remove thousands of bad seeds from the streets, it is never enough. Americans have the right to bear arms to defend themselves. Not just from foreign invasion, but from the evil of the individual who threatens you from right down the street. Why wait for the bad people to make the right mistakes that would lead to their prosecution? Why not protect the sheep - driving their cars, riding the subway, walking the streets, sitting alone in bars and offices - before they're sheered by the wolves? Why not intervene instead of cowering and then calling 911 after the damage has been done? Why not act as as a truly united people by protecting each other?People say that the events of The Brave One are too ""coincidental"" to be realistic, but that misses the main character's intentions. ERICA seeks out bad people by frequenting bad parts of town, especially at night. She knows the city and for the first time she is deliberately going to the places she has always known to avoid. In a very real sense, minus the cape and rubber suit, she is a superhero. Like the operatives who protect our citizens by keeping their identities a secret, so does ERICA BAIN. Remember: real superheroes are the ones you don't see.Comparisons to Death Wish, Taxi Driver and others are expected, but this film has something distinctly real and different to offer the thinking movie-goer. She is not a villain, she has no ego about her agenda, she is not cold or malicious, and she is not a sadist. She is a regular person (not an ex-cop or ex-con or ex-military) who has had enough of the vile sociopathic minority whose only aim is to terrorize, rape, rob, and murder the majority who just want to make their way peacefully in the world. Some argue that this is impossible, but that is just an echo of the fear machine propagated by the media and by the politicians whose votes are cast out of fear.ERICA sublimates her fears to carry out a mission of justice for the people of the city she loves, as well as for the greater good of humanity. In every office and classroom and city street, you can find a whole cast of characters that represent the different sides of the human condition.  Among them are the happy one, the sad one, the friendly one, the lonely one, the confident one, the frightened one, the peaceful one, the angry one, the zealous one, the tired one, the healthy one, the sickly one, and the apathetic one. ERICA is the brave one. If you don't accept this, then ask yourself why is it that millions cheer on the antics of Batman or Spiderman? Isn't it a good thing when Jason Voorhees is chopped to pieces? How about that personal vendetta of The Bride? Many believe that killing masses of ""bad guys"" is fine as long as the movie's setting is a far cry from reality.

Wong,"[0, 0]","Many people have compared this female vigilante film to earlier films like ""Ms45"" and ""Death Wish"" yet the fact that the sensitive Irish director Neil Jordan (The Crying Game, Interview with the Vampire) and Jodie Foster are involved plus the excellent Terrence Howard should make this a cut above those films. In many ways it is since instead of exploiting the violence that the main character creates--we get a sense that the closure will never come to that individual.  There is no catharisis, and Foster's character realizes what she is doing is wrong but she can't stop it? This element plus the superb interaction between Foster and Howard make this an above average action flick much much better than that terrible film which came out weeks before this one did (""Death Sentence"" with Kevin Bacon).

Jodie Foster plays her character Erica Bain (radio personality) with a passion and vulnerability.  That most don't even see especially considering the circumstances surrounding her transformation.  She and her boyfriend (Naveen Andrews) are out for a walk with their dog in the park late at night.  Not something i would do (but i digress) they confront some guys that have their dog that ran off and expect a reward for it. They only found it a few minutes ago so i dont understand that.  But he refuses and madness ensues after that with him being beaten to death and Jodie Foster being beaten unconscious herself.She awakes weeks later a former shell of herself and unable to make it out of her apartment for several days.  Once she finally makes it out of there and decides on what to do next.  Well she goes and buys a gun for protection, venegance and who knows what else.  There is the detective played rather well by Terrence Howard.  Whom she meets and they start to develop a connection that he believes is innocent.  But Erica knows otherwise as their are vigilante murders being carried out all over the city by her.I love how they show her characters as one that doesnt fit the norm of male killers.  She's doing what she does to help her cope and exist in a city that she once loved but now feels very differently to her.  She also feels like a totally different person as she copes with her boyfriend's death by dealing out her own brand of justice.  Will she get caught or killed herself or will she continue down this dark path of crime and murder undeterred.You really need to check out the Brave One for yourself.

1125436,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0010HOZVW,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 6]","For what really amounts to a standard revenge thriller, this 2007 movie has quite a pedigree with director Neil Jordan (The Crying Game,Breakfast on Pluto) at the helm and Jodie Foster as the star. Together, they provide greater texture and moral ambiguity than what one would expect from a formulaic, overly contrived script by the father-and-son screenwriting duo of Roderick and Bruce A. Taylor, and Cynthia Mort. Foster, in particular, seems to be channeling her most famous roles into a greatest hits package here, as I can see aspects of her enraged rape survivor inThe Accused, her tenacious FBI agent inThe Silence of the Lambs, and her victimized pre-teen prostitute inTaxi Driver. In fact, the film evokes the unsettling urban paranoia of Martin Scorsese's 1976 classic as much as it does the audience-pleasing vigilantism of 1973'sDeath Wish, the movie with which it is most frequently compared in professional reviews.With a low-key manner that appears to boil just underneath the surface, Foster plays Erica Bain, a public radio personality whose descriptive observations take inspiration from living in New York City, which she acknowledges is a safer place but profoundly changed since 9/11. At the outset, Erica is in an idyllic relationship with a younger doctor and preparing for her wedding. As she and her fianc&eacute; walk their dog through Central Park at dusk, a group of thugs abuse and attack them and one actually films their brutal act. Erica survives the attack, but unrelenting grief over her dead fianc&eacute; leads to a consuming fear. Unable to move past the tragedy and growing impatient with the police to find the men responsible, she illegally buys a 9mm handgun to protect herself. Witnessing a crime in a convenience store, Erica confronts her fear head on and finds herself on the offensive with an inability to connect with her old self.It's at this stage of the film that Jordan treads precariously between an intriguing examination of the corrupting power of violence and a series of visceral thrills that has Erica feeling bracingly liberated by her actions. The latter finally overtakes the film with the script's overly coincidental plot turns leading to a questionable ending. Complicating Erica's monomaniacal path to her fianc&eacute;'s killers is Sean Mercer, a cynical, emotionally damaged detective who gets drawn to her fate both professionally and personally. Terrence Howard is solid as Mercer, but the contrived, purposefully ambiguous nature of his character undermines his credibility. It also feels like the relationship between Mercer and Erica has been left vague more out of plot convenience than thoughtful consideration of the increasingly tense circumstances. Regardless, it's Foster who makes all the melodrama watchable, even though the familiarity of her steely determination is starting to feel like retread.Smaller roles are not as well fleshed out, though the actors shine briefly - Mary Steenburgen as Erica's plainspoken boss; Naveen Andrews as the unlucky fianc&eacute;; Nicky Katt relentlessly annoying as Mercer's wisecracking sidekick; and in what amounts to a convenient plot device, Nigerian actress Ene Oloja as Erica's unperturbed neighbor. If Z&ouml;e Kravitz looks familiar as the drugged runaway Chloe, that's because she's the daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet. Special mention should be given to Philippe Rousselot's cinematography which vividly matches the off-kilter urban landscape with Erica's unstable situation. The 2008 DVD is sparse on extras with no running commentary provided by either Jordan or Foster, who also served as one of the producers. There is a twenty-minute making-of featurette, ""I Walk the City"", in which Jordan, the producers, the screenwriters and the stars are interviewed. As usual, Foster comes across as the most articulate and insightful. In addition, there are five deleted scenes, all understandably excised from the final cut.",3,Jordan and a Ferocious Foster Teeter Between Adrenaline-Pumping Vigilante Thrills and a More Thoughtful Examination,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,3956,"['what', 'really', 'standard', 'revenge', 'thriller', '2007', 'movie', 'quite', 'pedigree', 'director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'helm', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'star', 'Together', 'provide', 'greater', 'texture', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'formulaic', 'overly', 'contrived', 'script', 'father-and-son', 'screenwriting', 'duo', 'Roderick', 'Bruce', 'A.', 'Taylor', 'Cynthia', 'Mort', 'Foster', 'particular', 'be', 'channeling', 'most', 'famous', 'roles', 'greatest', 'hits', 'package', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'aspects', 'enraged', 'rape', 'survivor', 'inThe', 'Accused', 'tenacious', 'FBI', 'agent', 'inThe', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'victimized', 'pre-teen', 'prostitute', 'inTaxi', 'Driver', 'fact', 'film', 'unsettling', 'urban', 'paranoia', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', '1976', 'classic', 'as', 'much', 'audience-pleasing', 'vigilantism', ""1973'sDeath"", 'Wish', 'movie', 'most', 'frequently', 'compared', 'professional', 'reviews.With', 'low-key', 'manner', 'boil', 'just', 'surface', 'Foster', 'Erica', 'Bain', 'public', 'radio', 'personality', 'descriptive', 'observations', 'take', 'inspiration', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'safer', 'place', 'profoundly', 'changed', '9/11', 'outset', 'Erica', 'idyllic', 'relationship', 'younger', 'doctor', 'preparing', 'wedding', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'walk', 'dog', 'Central', 'Park', 'dusk', 'group', 'thugs', 'abuse', 'attack', 'one', 'actually', 'films', 'brutal', 'act', 'Erica', 'attack', 'unrelenting', 'grief', 'dead', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'consuming', 'fear', 'Unable', 'move', 'tragedy', 'growing', 'impatient', 'police', 'find', 'men', 'responsible', 'illegally', '9mm', 'handgun', 'protect', 'Witnessing', 'crime', 'convenience', 'store', 'Erica', 'fear', 'head', 'offensive', 'inability', 'connect', 'old', 'self.It', 'stage', 'film', 'Jordan', 'precariously', 'intriguing', 'examination', 'corrupting', 'power', 'violence', 'series', 'visceral', 'thrills', 'Erica', 'feeling', 'bracingly', 'liberated', 'actions', 'latter', 'finally', 'film', 'script', 'overly', 'coincidental', 'plot', 'leading', 'questionable', 'ending', 'Complicating', 'Erica', 'monomaniacal', 'path', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'killers', 'Sean', 'Mercer', 'cynical', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'detective', 'who', 'drawn', 'fate', 'professionally', 'personally', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'solid', 'Mercer', 'contrived', 'purposefully', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'character', 'credibility', 'also', 'relationship', 'Mercer', 'Erica', 'been', 'left', 'vague', 'more', 'plot', 'convenience', 'thoughtful', 'consideration', 'increasingly', 'tense', 'circumstances', 'Regardless', 'Foster', 'who', 'melodrama', 'watchable', 'even', 'familiarity', 'steely', 'determination', 'starting', 'feel', 'retread.Smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'actors', 'shine', 'briefly', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Erica', 'plainspoken', 'boss', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'unlucky', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Nicky', 'Katt', 'relentlessly', 'annoying', 'Mercer', 'wisecracking', 'sidekick', 'what', 'amounts', 'convenient', 'plot', 'device', 'Nigerian', 'actress', 'Ene', 'Oloja', 'Erica', 'unperturbed', 'neighbor', 'Z', 'ouml', 'Kravitz', 'familiar', 'drugged', 'runaway', 'Chloe', 'daughter', 'Lenny', 'Kravitz', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'Special', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Philippe', 'Rousselot', 'cinematography', 'vividly', 'off-kilter', 'urban', 'landscape', 'Erica', 'unstable', 'situation', '2008', 'DVD', 'sparse', 'extras', 'running', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Jordan', 'Foster', 'who', 'also', 'served', 'one', 'producers', 'twenty-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Walk', 'City', 'Jordan', 'producers', 'screenwriters', 'stars', 'are', 'interviewed', 'usual', 'Foster', 'most', 'articulate', 'insightful', 'addition', 'are', 'five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'understandably', 'excised', 'final', 'cut']",N/A
1125437,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0010HOZVW,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","THE BRAVE ONE (2007), aside from being Jodie Foster's last good film, was always in my estimation an argument in favor of the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. With her powerhouse performance, Jodie Foster shows exactly what many gun owners experience to some degree; at film's end we are left wondering whether we should own a gun also.Foster plays Erica Bain, a New York City DJ who ruminates late at night about her beloved city. She's one of those sexy voices many people find themselves addicted to hearing on a regular basis, and is an excellent cure for the loneliness only a big city can create. In a brutal, sadistic attack in Central Park, Erica loses her fianc&eacute; David Kirmani (a very sexy Naveen Andrews). After awakening from a coma in the hospital, Erica suffers the natural meltdown upon learning of the murder.This rather precipitate storyline interested me in one singular point: once Erica seeks to buy a gun and receive instruction, she panics and yells that she must have a gun immediately or she ""will die"". That reaction in the face of a normal gun acquisition struck me as the loud indicator that Erica is somewhat out of her mind. She skips the formalities and buys a gun 'out of the trunk of a car', as we say.The scene with the trafficker giving her rapid lessons in a back alley is heartrending. Soon Erica is making her way around NYC, blasting away at all deserving bad guys. If you recall the tragic case of Bernard Goetz in the NYC subway decades ago, you'll understand her. Eventually she entices criminals only to shoot them down, but the first time she is forced to use her gun - in a store robbery - her horrible agitation and the adrenalin makes the scene that much more horrific and memorable.She is watched over, helped a bit, by a police officer (the wonderful Terence Howard as Detective Mercer). He seems to be the left-wing anti-gun voice in the film, yet he, too eventually gives way to the need for citizens to be armed. In an ending I will not divulge, the audience learns all about guns, whether we want to or not.As a gun advocate and one-time owner, which always shocks everyone, I loved this film for its unblinking approach to one person's need for a gun. Foster becomes like a junkie, spraying bullets quite expertly at the bad guys and glaring with maniacal glee once the job's done. She's protecting her city and its citizens. The fear of public retribution is probably what stopped this film from mutating into a weird vigilante-based superhero franchise.The cinematography is in my view rather unique and stunning for such a film as this. The acting is top-notch, though Foster carries too much of it by herself and Howard is left sort of panting after her in certain scenes. I know Foster wanted this film to be anti-gun, and approached it that way. She succeeded in evoking the opposite feelings, and I'd show this film to anyone, any age, who felt compelled to get a gun for self-defense.That is as far as I go in my appreciation of this film as gun advocacy; the producers would surely not thank me for it but there it is on screen! It is a real nail-biter, taught, tense and terrifying. A unique thing about this film is that I imagined every great director would have made it exactly the same way. That is one powerful film.Final note: read the review by Bama. Bama is a brave soul who was attacked like Erica Bain, and that made THE BRAVE ONE real and therapeutic for Bama. The idea that the victim is in a way dead, is post-crime a different person, is a powerful agony we must all try to understand. And Bama says something very Buddhist: you don't have to murder someone to take their life from them.If we learned that lesson, we wouldn't need any form of weapon at all.",5,"Feelin' lucky, punk?",1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,3763,"['BRAVE', 'ONE', '2007', 'aside', 'being', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'last', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'always', 'estimation', 'argument', 'favor', '2nd', 'Amendment', 'Constitution', 'United', 'States', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'exactly', 'what', 'many', 'gun', 'owners', 'experience', 'degree', 'film', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'should', 'own', 'gun', 'also.Foster', 'Erica', 'Bain', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'DJ', 'who', 'late', 'night', 'beloved', 'city', 'one', 'sexy', 'voices', 'many', 'people', 'find', 'addicted', 'hearing', 'regular', 'basis', 'excellent', 'cure', 'loneliness', 'only', 'big', 'city', 'can', 'create', 'brutal', 'sadistic', 'attack', 'Central', 'Park', 'Erica', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'David', 'Kirmani', 'very', 'sexy', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'awakening', 'coma', 'hospital', 'Erica', 'natural', 'meltdown', 'learning', 'murder.This', 'rather', 'precipitate', 'storyline', 'interested', 'one', 'singular', 'point', 'once', 'Erica', 'buy', 'gun', 'receive', 'instruction', 'panics', 'yells', 'must', 'have', 'gun', 'immediately', 'will', 'die', 'reaction', 'face', 'normal', 'gun', 'acquisition', 'struck', 'loud', 'indicator', 'Erica', 'somewhat', 'mind', 'formalities', 'gun', 'trunk', 'car', 'say.The', 'scene', 'trafficker', 'giving', 'rapid', 'lessons', 'back', 'alley', 'heartrending', 'Soon', 'Erica', 'making', 'way', 'NYC', 'blasting', 'away', 'deserving', 'bad', 'guys', 'recall', 'tragic', 'case', 'Bernard', 'Goetz', 'NYC', 'subway', 'decades', 'ago', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'Eventually', 'criminals', 'only', 'shoot', 'down', 'first', 'time', 'forced', 'use', 'gun', 'store', 'robbery', 'horrible', 'agitation', 'adrenalin', 'scene', 'much', 'more', 'horrific', 'memorable.She', 'watched', 'helped', 'bit', 'police', 'officer', 'wonderful', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'Detective', 'Mercer', 'be', 'left-wing', 'anti-gun', 'voice', 'film', 'yet', 'too', 'eventually', 'way', 'need', 'citizens', 'be', 'armed', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'divulge', 'audience', 'guns', 'want', 'not.As', 'gun', 'advocate', 'one-time', 'owner', 'always', 'everyone', 'loved', 'film', 'unblinking', 'approach', 'one', 'person', 'need', 'gun', 'Foster', 'junkie', 'spraying', 'bullets', 'quite', 'expertly', 'bad', 'guys', 'glaring', 'maniacal', 'glee', 'job', 'done', 'protecting', 'city', 'citizens', 'fear', 'public', 'retribution', 'probably', 'what', 'stopped', 'film', 'mutating', 'weird', 'vigilante-based', 'superhero', 'franchise.The', 'cinematography', 'view', 'rather', 'unique', 'stunning', 'film', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'Foster', 'too', 'much', 'Howard', 'left', 'sort', 'panting', 'certain', 'scenes', 'know', 'Foster', 'wanted', 'film', 'be', 'anti-gun', 'approached', 'way', 'succeeded', 'evoking', 'opposite', 'feelings', ""'d"", 'show', 'film', 'anyone', 'age', 'who', 'felt', 'compelled', 'get', 'gun', 'self-defense.That', 'as', 'far', 'go', 'appreciation', 'film', 'gun', 'advocacy', 'producers', 'would', 'surely', 'not', 'thank', 'screen', 'real', 'nail-biter', 'taught', 'tense', 'terrifying', 'unique', 'thing', 'film', 'imagined', 'great', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'one', 'powerful', 'film.Final', 'note', 'read', 'review', 'Bama', 'Bama', 'brave', 'soul', 'who', 'was', 'attacked', 'Erica', 'Bain', 'made', 'BRAVE', 'ONE', 'real', 'therapeutic', 'Bama', 'idea', 'victim', 'way', 'dead', 'post-crime', 'different', 'person', 'powerful', 'agony', 'must', 'try', 'understand', 'Bama', 'something', 'very', 'Buddhist', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'murder', 'someone', 'take', 'life', 'them.If', 'learned', 'lesson', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'form', 'weapon']",N/A

That's the tag line by the film company about this movie.We watched it first at the movies and even though one should not feel that way, we felt rooting for her as she is getting her revenge. If people would really react to violence the way the protagonist does in this movie, we would all live in chaos. After half an hour into the movie, we decided to see it as what it is, a kind of a remake of one of the old Charles Bronson revenge movies. The main character feels no remorse about even the most unbelievable things done by her. Jodie Foster plays the wounded woman very believable, as well as the revengeful one in the second part of the film. The film takes itself maybe a little too serious and could have attracted more viewers, if it would be even trashier, than it is.If you want to watch a ""shoot them all up"" movie, you are in the right theater.

Such is the premise for this well-constructed film by Neil Jordan (screenplay by Roderick Taylor and Bruce Taylor), and while the neither concept of trauma-altered personality or revenge tales is new, THE BRAVE ONE alters the vengeance idea just enough to make it credible and to even draw the viewer into believing that what the character is doing is justified and right!  And that is perhaps the most frightening aspect of this terrifying film.Erica Bain (Jodie Foster) is a night radio talk show performer, a woman who walks the city of New York gathering sounds and observing the mysteries of the 'safest big city' and relates her observations poetically to a large radio audience.  Erica is engaged to young physician David (Naveen Andrews) and the couple are very much in love. One night on an evening stroll with their dog they are attacked by thugs, beaten with pipes, and David is killed while Erica narrowly survives. Upon awakening from her coma she is devastated by her loss of David and becomes a strangely haunted woman, unable to sleep, unable to get immediate help from the police, and turns to purchasing a gun in an attempt to right the wrongs she has suffered.  This new 'person' or 'stranger within' happens to witness a murder in a little store and to her amazement she responds by killing the murderer.  A similar situation happens on the subway where two thugs threaten people, threaten Erica, and Erica again responds by killing the thugs. She feels driven to avenge the death of her David, but at the same time fears her own inner stranger. Erica returns to her radio show, under changing instructions form her boss Carol (Mary Steenburgen), and finds the changes in her psyche result in bracing her listeners about fear on the streets.  In her audience is Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) who has personal problems related to the fact that he has been unable to arrest a known killer.  Mercer connects with Erica in various ways, she interviews him for her show, and the two bond.  Erica trusts Mercer, wants to share what she is doing, yet hears his frustration about not being able to seek his own brand of revenge frustration against the oily killer he pursues, and decides to eliminate that trauma for Mercer.  As the tension builds, the identity of Erica's assailants is discovered, and how she deals with these thugs (and with Mercer's interaction in the solution) forms the surprising ending for the film.Too little has been written and said about the quality of performances from both Foster and Howard in this tense thriller.  These two actors deliver performances so sensitive in execution that memories of previous similar films evaporate.  This is a tough film to watch for all the violence not only on the screen but from within the characterizations by the actors (with the capable direction of Neil Jordan), but it is for this viewer one of the strongest films of the year.  Perhaps now that the DVD can be viewed within the safety of the home more people will pay attention to a film that deserves awards.

The Brave One is like a toned-down version of Punisher War Zone, minus the black costume, the big guns and all the cartoon violence.I must admit that I fast-forwarded through the plot set-up scene (people run around late at night in Central Park not paying attention? Really? Nope. Stupid plot twist..) due to its silliness. So the woman reacts to her attack by getting a *gasp* Devil Machine - a gun. Immediately, it turns her into a short,skinny version of Frank Castle - blowing away ""bad people"" left and right. Of course, the cops are stymied, except for one guy of course.After watching the whole movie, I thought, y'know if she (or her boyfriend or both) had that gun in the beginning, there would'nt be any movie at all (personally, I think Jodie should have gone with a snub nose .357 instead of that 9mm - more stopping power and less chance of a fatal jamming incident, but thats just me..). And of course, she is able to get a gun illegally in 5 minutes, in Manhattan - OK, if you say so Jodie. Also, on a side note - you never see her cleaning the gun, a big no-no if you are going to use an automatic. The whole ""guns are bad, they make nuts nuttier"" premise of the movie is lost amid all the violence.The Brave One is not a horrible movie, however. I've seen worse.

She's had a good run of late and has done some very good films. Flightplan. I quite liked, among other films I thought Inside Man was good although her consequence to the plot is limited, Panic Room was a great film. It's 2008 and she's 45 and she looks 45. There is an element of fearlessness I see in Jodie Foster which truly comes out when she acts in films such as this one. I'll stop being POP TATE and will get to the chase.The Brave One starts with an accident, drags for 10-12 mins, features an amazing performance from the ever-so-improved, Terrence Howard (from the amazing CRASH and the recent good film called ""Air I Breathe""), Naveen Andrews has a small role and I couldn't help but notice how well he fit the part and looked it. The storyline isn't much that but there are several instances where human intricasies are bought out. For instance, there is this one scene in which the cop asks a person who just enters the police station to have a seat and offers a kind word. He later offers exactly the same kind word and greeting to the other person and so on. I think it was remarkable how that was done. I found the one scene in which the young man describes Jodie Foster pretty funny but that's the only scene in the film I'd call funny.If you're watching THE BRAVE ONE at the theater, you can't help but share the resentment and downright hatred the central character feels towards degenerates that often flog streets of the urbs and subway trains. There was definitely a lot of imagination involved in the abilities of one single woman but the particular subject matter had to be dealth with. My review says one can't quite describe in words the message of the film but I'll give it a try.This film talks about an often over-looked downside of a city. Festering in small corners are unhappy, unyielding, morally dwindled lives that are what society terms as troublemakers. I dislike degenerates immensely. There is a world that exists and police, law and order, mafia, protection can do nothing about it. But a gun and a heavy heart can or rather might.I'll stop meandering. You will relate to this film if at any stage of your life you have felt helpless. It is for that moment we replay in our mind, always cringing, but wishing we had done something or said something to the trouble maker.Pretty good film.

1125453,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0010HOZVW,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 2]","This film is fascinating and does not need a long commentary, though a decent review has to deal with a certain number of problems the film evokes and even invokes.The first element of note is the brunt and even brutish description of criminal violence in New York City. You have to shoot first, kill the shopkeeper as soon as you enter the corner store, then take the money without even checking if there is anyone around and then run. Killing is always the first step of that crime. Stealing is second and cleaning up is even farther down the road to hell. Who cares anyway since most of these criminals are still running, no matter whether they have been ""introduced"" to a judge and a court or not.The police has no power whatsoever when confronted to these thugs. The vigilante reflex is then one possible reaction from the public, passive most of the time but one out of a million makes about 15 ready to draw their guns and start shooting at them. Shooting them dead of course.The second problem is the point of view from which this film is seen, that of the victim of some violence of that type who has managed to survive by sheer luck. She wants to get out of this past but this past will never be bygone, so it has to be expurgated, purged, flushed away and the homeopathic method, since the standard police doctor is out, is the best way to extinguish the pain.The rest is the final twist. You will not be able to foresee the end even if you know the victim at stake here is a radio show anchorwoman. Radio people often have a strange imagination because they are used to being invisible since they are only a voice.Enjoy the ending, and the in-between details. A good film altogether and the vision of Central Park is slightly less conventional than usual.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Dogs may lead you to your lethal fate,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,1788,"['film', 'fascinating', 'not', 'need', 'long', 'commentary', 'decent', 'review', 'deal', 'certain', 'number', 'problems', 'film', 'evokes', 'even', 'invokes.The', 'first', 'element', 'note', 'brunt', 'even', 'brutish', 'description', 'criminal', 'violence', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'have', 'shoot', 'first', 'kill', 'shopkeeper', 'as', 'soon', 'enter', 'corner', 'store', 'then', 'take', 'money', 'even', 'checking', 'anyone', 'around', 'then', 'run', 'Killing', 'always', 'first', 'step', 'crime', 'Stealing', 'second', 'cleaning', 'up', 'even', 'farther', 'down', 'road', 'hell', 'Who', 'anyway', 'most', 'criminals', 'are', 'still', 'running', 'matter', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'judge', 'court', 'not.The', 'police', 'power', 'whatsoever', 'when', 'confronted', 'thugs', 'vigilante', 'reflex', 'then', 'one', 'possible', 'reaction', 'public', 'passive', 'most', 'time', 'one', 'out', 'million', '15', 'ready', 'draw', 'guns', 'start', 'shooting', 'Shooting', 'dead', 'course.The', 'second', 'problem', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'seen', 'victim', 'violence', 'type', 'who', 'managed', 'survive', 'sheer', 'luck', 'get', 'past', 'past', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'bygone', 'be', 'expurgated', 'purged', 'flushed', 'away', 'homeopathic', 'method', 'standard', 'police', 'doctor', 'out', 'best', 'way', 'extinguish', 'pain.The', 'rest', 'final', 'twist', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'foresee', 'end', 'even', 'know', 'victim', 'stake', 'here', 'radio', 'show', 'anchorwoman', 'Radio', 'people', 'often', 'have', 'strange', 'imagination', 'are', 'used', 'being', 'invisible', 'are', 'only', 'voice.Enjoy', 'ending', 'in-between', 'details', 'good', 'film', 'altogether', 'vision', 'Central', 'Park', 'slightly', 'less', 'conventional', 'usual.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

1125456,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0010HOZVW,Jason,"[0, 0]","Erica Bain (Jodie Foster) is the radio host of a pretentious program on some no doubt mind-deadening station.  Her life is great and her eyes are closed to the real horrors of the city.  But she soon has to watch her fianc&eacute; die at the hands of brutal murderers who also leave her in a coma and steal her dog.  They steal her dog!  Upon awakening, her world is rocked; she's borderline agoraphobic.In a situation like this, people typically do one of two things.  They either bury it deep inside, letting it burn, crippling them emotionally for years; or, they act out in a way that will help them overcome the trauma.  Erica chooses the latter option, buying a gun, becoming revitalized, and seeking a complete resolution.  Like Sally Field inEye For An Eye, I'm VERY pleased with her choice.From there she channels her inner Bronson and begins to clean up New York, one dirt bag at a time.First up, a man enters a gas station, gets angry - more than likely about the fact that the clerk had trouble scanning a debit card - and blows his top like Michael Douglas fromFalling Downif you added a strong meth addiction to the picture.  Bain whips out her hand-cannon and fires from one aisle to another, through merchandise, to avenge the murder.  Clean up, aisle three!  As a follow-up she recreates my favorite scene from the Bernhard Goetz biography, and it's thoroughly satisfying.The transformation Bain undergoes from safety to paranoia to judge/jury/executioner is what truly makes this movie great.  Philosophical, political, emotional, physical, it's a metamorphosis in every way (similar to the 180 degree change Travis Bickle wanted for her inTaxi Driver).  She may have thought that New York was one of the safest big cities before she was attacked - something she mentioned early on - but the experience has now opened her myopic eyes.  Now, she plans on ensuring her previous misconceptions ring true.This is, by far, my favorite Jodie Foster performance, and her performance is absolutely mesmerizing.  Highly recommended.

Jodie Foster is no surprise, of course, and her handling of the Erica Bain character leaves absolutely nothing lacking.  Terrence Howard (Detective Mercer) earned his sensitivity stripes in Crash as far as I'm concerned and he brought even more of the same to this role.  Even the supporting roles were handled superbly:  Nicky Katt as Mercer's partner, Ene Oloja as Bain's neighbor, and Mary Steenburgen as her boss at the NYC radio station just added another layer of luster to the tale.

1125464,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B0010HOZVW,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[0, 1]","Death Wish (Bronson) started it.  Harry Brown (Michael Cain) is a London version.  Goetz (as in Bernard) continued it in real life.  Taxi Driver was another one, albeit with a much different plot.  And don't forget Gran Torino -- the excellent Clint Eastwood film that's not quite the ""pure"" vigilante flick.  And now ""The Brave One"" adds another twist to the Vigilante Genre, with Foster's skinny feminine toughness playing a female version of the vigilante.  And she actually does a pretty good one, being intense, tough-minded, lethal, albeit not very vulnerable and a bit unrealistic.Vigilante movies are enjoyable to a certain extent.  That's because they are doing what we long to do (gun down a criminal) without the intense danger of getting killed, totally humiliated, or being caught and put in prison for a long, long time.  Look at the real-world example of Bernard Goetz being prosecuted, villified, jailed and sued, and you might not like the vigilante idea so much. Movies like ""The Brave One"" are much safer to experience vicariously.Like in virtually all the Vigilante flicks, there's a) the Initial Attack, b) the Murder of a Friend or Family, c) the protagonist's quest to Fight Back, d) the Stalking and Vigilante Phase, e) the Police Response, and f) the Final Scene.  A common feature is the idea of the hidden evil in every ""nice"" person, brought out by being a crime victim, in a Jekyl and Hyde manner.  It promotes tension because the person's Mr Hyde comes out at night while their Dr Jekyl seems so innocent by day, and you wonder when their friends will find out who they really are.The film starts off by Foster with her Indian boyfriend (Naveen Andrews of Lost fame) getting viciously mugged in Central Park New York.  Foster lives, but Andrews doesn't.  After getting the runaround by the uncaring legal system, Foster illegally purchases a handgun and starts her vigilante phase, all the while trying to carry on her Dr. Jekyl routine as a nice talk-show host.  Then Detective Sean Mercer (Terrence Howard), starts tracking her down.  Foster has the intensity and runty aggressiveness to actually pull this off.  Remember The Silence of the Lambs when she was an FBI agent?  That tough character is INSIDE of her now, and comes out when she does her vigilante hit jobs.  The only criticism that I have of her acting job is that her toughness is a little TOO invulnerable, while her feminine and insecure side rapidly disappears from the screen, to almost zero.  Thus instead of her being this citizen who is scared of what she is doing, she turns into Super Jodie a little too strongly.  So (I believe) we never get the tension of thinking that she's going to get hurt, killed or caught.&lt; Spoilers >One thing that I thought was cheesy was one of her last hits, when she knocks off a Mafia guy with a crow-bar.  Scary in a way, but Come On! A bit over-the-top ""Super Jodie"" for me.Social Commentary:  I think that the producers of these movies must be very careful to not let them spiral into racism, because the White protagonists are killing thugs and (the fear is) many viewers might get their vicarious kicks watching the non-white thugs getting shot.  I think that they covered this in The Brave One by having Foster's boyfriend be Indian, and spreading her criminal ""victims"" around various races. Also, the Detective on her case is Black.  The older movie-makers didn't do this in quite such a ""PC Proactive"" way such as in Death Wish, probably because movies weren't so PC back in the '70s. (a character asks in Death Wish why Bronson's victims were predominately Black, and the response was that ""crimes are committed dis-proportionately by Blacks.""  You would never see that in a movie today!)  Ditto for Taxi Driver, which also came very close to being racist.  But the makers of The Brave One do their part to avoid this criticism.At any rate, I recommend The Brave One -- better yet, I recommend true Movie Fans watch all four of the most famous Vigilante Flicks listed above (maybe in one weekend), to get true perspective on this genre that pops up every few years to entertain us by showing the Good Citizens plugging the Bad Guys!",4,"Effective Movie in the Vigilante Genre, with Foster quite the Female Assassin!",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,4181,"['Death', 'Wish', 'Bronson', 'started', 'Harry', 'Brown', 'Michael', 'Cain', 'London', 'version', 'Goetz', 'Bernard', 'continued', 'real', 'life', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'was', 'one', 'much', 'different', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'excellent', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'pure', 'vigilante', 'flick', 'now', 'Brave', 'One', 'twist', 'Vigilante', 'Genre', 'Foster', 'skinny', 'feminine', 'toughness', 'playing', 'female', 'version', 'vigilante', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'being', 'intense', 'tough-minded', 'lethal', 'not', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'bit', 'unrealistic.Vigilante', 'movies', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'certain', 'extent', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'long', 'do', 'gun', 'down', 'criminal', 'intense', 'danger', 'getting', 'killed', 'totally', 'humiliated', 'being', 'caught', 'put', 'prison', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'Look', 'real-world', 'example', 'Bernard', 'Goetz', 'being', 'prosecuted', 'villified', 'jailed', 'sued', 'might', 'not', 'vigilante', 'idea', 'so', 'much', 'Movies', 'Brave', 'One', 'are', 'much', 'safer', 'experience', 'vicariously.Like', 'virtually', 'Vigilante', 'flicks', 'Initial', 'Attack', 'b', 'Murder', 'Friend', 'Family', 'c', 'protagonist', 'quest', 'Fight', 'Back', 'd', 'Stalking', 'Vigilante', 'Phase', 'e', 'Police', 'Response', 'f', 'Final', 'Scene', 'A', 'common', 'feature', 'idea', 'hidden', 'evil', 'nice', 'person', 'brought', 'out', 'being', 'crime', 'victim', 'Jekyl', 'Hyde', 'manner', 'tension', 'person', 'Mr', 'Hyde', 'out', 'night', 'Dr', 'Jekyl', 'so', 'innocent', 'day', 'wonder', 'when', 'friends', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'are.The', 'film', 'starts', 'off', 'Foster', 'Indian', 'boyfriend', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Lost', 'fame', 'getting', 'viciously', 'mugged', 'Central', 'Park', 'New', 'York', 'Foster', 'Andrews', ""n't"", 'getting', 'runaround', 'uncaring', 'legal', 'system', 'Foster', 'illegally', 'purchases', 'handgun', 'vigilante', 'phase', 'while', 'trying', 'carry', 'Dr.', 'Jekyl', 'routine', 'nice', 'talk-show', 'host', 'Then', 'Detective', 'Sean', 'Mercer', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'tracking', 'down', 'Foster', 'intensity', 'runty', 'aggressiveness', 'actually', 'pull', 'off', 'Remember', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'when', 'was', 'FBI', 'agent', 'tough', 'character', 'INSIDE', 'now', 'out', 'when', 'vigilante', 'hit', 'jobs', 'only', 'criticism', 'have', 'acting', 'job', 'toughness', 'little', 'TOO', 'invulnerable', 'feminine', 'insecure', 'side', 'rapidly', 'screen', 'almost', 'zero', 'Thus', 'instead', 'being', 'citizen', 'who', 'scared', 'what', 'doing', 'Super', 'Jodie', 'little', 'too', 'strongly', 'So', 'believe', 'never', 'get', 'tension', 'thinking', 'going', 'get', 'hurt', 'killed', 'caught.', 'lt', 'Spoilers', '>', 'One', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'cheesy', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'hits', 'when', 'Mafia', 'guy', 'crow-bar', 'Scary', 'way', 'Come', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'Super', 'Jodie', 'me.Social', 'Commentary', 'think', 'producers', 'movies', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'not', 'let', 'spiral', 'racism', 'White', 'protagonists', 'are', 'killing', 'thugs', 'fear', 'many', 'viewers', 'might', 'get', 'vicarious', 'kicks', 'watching', 'non-white', 'thugs', 'getting', 'shot', 'think', 'covered', 'Brave', 'One', 'having', 'Foster', 'boyfriend', 'be', 'Indian', 'spreading', 'criminal', 'victims', 'various', 'races', 'Also', 'Detective', 'case', 'Black', 'older', 'movie-makers', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'quite', 'such', 'PC', 'Proactive', 'way', 'such', 'Death', 'Wish', 'probably', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'PC', 'back', ""'70s"", 'character', 'Death', 'Wish', 'why', 'Bronson', 'victims', 'were', 'predominately', 'Black', 'response', 'was', 'crimes', 'are', 'committed', 'dis-proportionately', 'Blacks', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'movie', 'today', 'Ditto', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'also', 'came', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'racist', 'makers', 'Brave', 'One', 'do', 'part', 'avoid', 'criticism.At', 'rate', 'recommend', 'Brave', 'One', 'better', 'yet', 'recommend', 'true', 'Movie', 'Fans', 'watch', 'four', 'most', 'famous', 'Vigilante', 'Flicks', 'listed', 'maybe', 'one', 'weekend', 'get', 'true', 'perspective', 'genre', 'up', 'few', 'years', 'entertain', 'showing', 'Good', 'Citizens', 'plugging', 'Bad', 'Guys']",N/A

""I Walk the City"" would have been more eye catching, appropriate to the film content, and easier on word of mouth promotion.This film is well acted, the cinematography is good, it moves crisply with good dialog. But the plot has the wrong ending. Up to two thirds of the film allows two endings of which the film makers were aware - does the vigilante get caught or not? The chose the wrong outcome. Had the main character been caught, then the sense of audience outrage would have been stirred in the moral dilemma and make it an unforgettable film.

Review is based on DVD rental. )*** spoilers ***""The Brave One"" deftly retells 1970s ""Death Wish"" as a parable of 9/11 and its aftermath.NYC residents Erica Bain (Foster) and her fiance David are suddenly and brutally attacked by street thugs one evening, falling like the twin towers.  David dies, Erica survives.Frightened and paranoid that anyone could be her next attacker, she buys a gun.  Within a short time she's forced to shoot someone in self-defense.  This gives her confidence to shoot again when she's menaced by some bullies -- or would-be rapists -- on the subway.She then begins to practically look for trouble.  And finds it with a demented pimp holding a young girl as his captive prostitute.  This is both an homage to Foster's role in ""Taxi Driver"" and an analog to Afghanistan's female-suppressing Taliban regime.Erica moves on to seek out and kill a vicious criminal who had dodged the  justice system.  I can't recall the character's name, but ""Saddam Hussein"" is close enough.  There's no doubt he was a bad man but Erica herself continues to descend into amorality ... and she knows it.The story of revenge run amok arcs to a conclusion as Erica finds and kills her original assailants.  Only then can she walk through the dark tunnel where she was attacked, emerging on the other side at last.Throughout the story themes and images of alienation and estrangement are in play.  As a stand-in for America, Erica's transformation parallels our own as we trade our trusting nature for fear, our peacefulness for war, our freedoms for elements of a police state.  Erica seems unable to stop her decline (if that's what it is) until her personal al Queda -- the three killers -- are dead.""The Brave One"" subtly and bravely challenges us to think about the costs of vengeance and how tenuous security can be.",4,story of and for our times,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,1862,"['did', 'not', 'purchase', 'Amazon', 'Review', 'based', 'DVD', 'rental', '***', 'spoilers', '***', 'Brave', 'One', 'deftly', '1970s', 'Death', 'Wish', 'parable', '9/11', 'aftermath.NYC', 'residents', 'Erica', 'Bain', 'Foster', 'fiance', 'David', 'are', 'suddenly', 'brutally', 'attacked', 'street', 'thugs', 'one', 'evening', 'falling', 'twin', 'towers', 'David', 'Erica', 'survives.Frightened', 'paranoid', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'next', 'attacker', 'gun', 'short', 'time', 'forced', 'shoot', 'someone', 'self-defense', 'confidence', 'shoot', 'again', 'when', 'menaced', 'bullies', 'would-be', 'rapists', 'subway.She', 'then', 'practically', 'look', 'trouble', 'demented', 'pimp', 'holding', 'young', 'girl', 'captive', 'prostitute', 'homage', 'Foster', 'role', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'analog', 'Afghanistan', 'female-suppressing', 'Taliban', 'regime.Erica', 'moves', 'seek', 'out', 'kill', 'vicious', 'criminal', 'who', 'had', 'dodged', 'justice', 'system', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'character', 'name', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'close', 'enough', 'doubt', 'was', 'bad', 'man', 'Erica', 'descend', 'amorality', 'it.The', 'story', 'revenge', 'run', 'amok', 'conclusion', 'Erica', 'original', 'assailants', 'Only', 'then', 'can', 'walk', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'where', 'was', 'attacked', 'emerging', 'other', 'side', 'story', 'themes', 'images', 'alienation', 'estrangement', 'are', 'play', 'stand-in', 'America', 'Erica', 'transformation', 'own', 'trade', 'trusting', 'nature', 'fear', 'peacefulness', 'war', 'freedoms', 'elements', 'police', 'state', 'Erica', 'unable', 'stop', 'decline', 'what', 'personal', 'al', 'Queda', 'three', 'killers', 'are', 'dead', 'Brave', 'One', 'subtly', 'bravely', 'think', 'costs', 'vengeance', 'how', 'tenuous', 'security', 'can', 'be']",N/A

1125469,A1PWHYY673OKZA,B0010HOZVW,Kablamo!,"[7, 17]","I was really looking forward to this film.  Jodie Foster is a gifted actress with some serious street cred as the woman-pushed-to-her-limits character, so my expectations were high.But I'm just totally disappointed.  First of all, let's not tapdance around the 800-pound gorilla that's always in the room when discussing this movie:  it's almost exactly the same format as 1974's Death Wish.  Yes, this movie has some added twists at the end and yes, it has far more grandiose ambitions than Death Wish, but the format is the same and, in fact, it is that extra reaching that I think kills the film.Whereas Death Wish was a straight-up vigilante revenge movie that simply showed a gentle man transformed into an empowered revenge-seeker, this movie gets all caught up on ""trying to explore what we are capable of"" and all of that, and it turns out that either (a) it's just not that interesting to explore or (b) they didn't explore it very well.  You know this is what they were going for... just watch the included documentary about the film to see the writers, the producer, and Ms. Foster blather on about what they were trying to do and blah blah blah.  But instead of covering new territory here, the film feels to me like an overwrought, slightly reimagined rehash of the Death Wish story.  Unfortunately, where Death Wish is simple and effective, and in spite of its simplicity does indeed explore some challenging issues, this movie is complex, far fetched, sometimes boring, and ultimately not very satisfying.Another key problem I have with this movie is the fact that it's in present-day New York (according to the documentary, New York is a ""character"" in the movie; how sophisticated).  Although I was not alive in 1974, it's my understanding that crime in New York City in the early 1970's -- and in many other major US cities at the time -- was so out of control, and the public was so disenchanted with the inability of the police to reduce the crime, that there was this widespread fantasy of the everyman taking the law into his own hands.  In 2008, however, New York is an entirely different place.  There is crime, there is certainly violent crime, and there are I'm sure many cases where victims will never see justice delivered by ""the system,"" but I think that today it is harder to cheer for the armed vigilante because crime is relatively low and the New York Police Department is actually run pretty well.I live in New York.  Again and again throughout the movie I thought to myself, ""New York is not like that!"" or ""I am supposed to believe these people are New Yorkers?""  Well, would you believe this: On the documentary they actually discuss how the writer of the screenplay went on a whirlwind tour of the City to learn about it for the movie, presumably because he's not a New Yorker!  Ha!  And yet he would presume to make New York a _character_ in the movie?  Puh-lease!But I digress.It's especially hard to cheer for Jodie Foster's character, Erica, because she seems like a total wacko.  What is her profession?  She records ""sounds"" around the City and incorporates them into her radio monologues.  Okay, maybe she's an artist, but what kind of la-la land fool would actually close her eyes and lose herself while making out with her boyfriend in some scary corner of a scary park at night?  Of course, the horrible attack does not help her out psychologically.  On the contrary, she just goes straight downhill -- it seems like she has been totally wrecked and is now just some kind of crazy woman with a gun.This movie tries to be sophisticated, tries to achieve the brilliant complexity of a Taxi Driver, but is just not that good.  Not even in the same ballpark.  Unfortunately, its lofty ambitions also obfuscate what could have been a simple, visceral, effective revenge movie like Death Wish, cluttering it up with all kinds of extra baloney that just drag it down into lameness.  It feels like a bad episode of CSI.",2,Totally Disappointing,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,3960,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'gifted', 'actress', 'serious', 'street', 'cred', 'woman-pushed-to-her-limits', 'character', 'expectations', 'were', 'high.But', ""'m"", 'just', 'totally', 'disappointed', 'First', 'let', 'not', 'tapdance', '800-pound', 'gorilla', 'always', 'room', 'when', 'discussing', 'movie', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'format', '1974', 'Death', 'Wish', 'Yes', 'movie', 'added', 'twists', 'end', 'yes', 'far', 'more', 'grandiose', 'ambitions', 'Death', 'Wish', 'format', 'same', 'fact', 'extra', 'reaching', 'think', 'film.Whereas', 'Death', 'Wish', 'was', 'straight-up', 'vigilante', 'revenge', 'movie', 'simply', 'showed', 'gentle', 'man', 'transformed', 'empowered', 'revenge-seeker', 'movie', 'caught', 'up', 'trying', 'explore', 'what', 'are', 'capable', 'out', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'explore', 'b', 'did', ""n't"", 'explore', 'very', 'well', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'just', 'watch', 'included', 'documentary', 'film', 'see', 'writers', 'producer', 'Ms.', 'Foster', 'blather', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'instead', 'covering', 'new', 'territory', 'here', 'film', 'feels', 'overwrought', 'slightly', 'reimagined', 'rehash', 'Death', 'Wish', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'where', 'Death', 'Wish', 'simple', 'effective', 'spite', 'simplicity', 'indeed', 'explore', 'challenging', 'issues', 'movie', 'complex', 'far', 'fetched', 'sometimes', 'boring', 'ultimately', 'not', 'very', 'satisfying.Another', 'key', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'fact', 'present-day', 'New', 'York', 'according', 'documentary', 'New', 'York', 'character', 'movie', 'how', 'sophisticated', 'was', 'not', 'alive', '1974', 'understanding', 'crime', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'early', '1970', 'many', 'other', 'major', 'US', 'cities', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'control', 'public', 'was', 'so', 'disenchanted', 'inability', 'police', 'reduce', 'crime', 'was', 'widespread', 'fantasy', 'everyman', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands', '2008', 'however', 'New', 'York', 'entirely', 'different', 'place', 'crime', 'certainly', 'violent', 'crime', 'are', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'cases', 'where', 'victims', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'justice', 'delivered', 'system', 'think', 'today', 'harder', 'cheer', 'armed', 'vigilante', 'crime', 'relatively', 'low', 'New', 'York', 'Police', 'Department', 'actually', 'run', 'pretty', 'well.I', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'Again', 'again', 'movie', 'thought', 'myself', 'New', 'York', 'not', 'am', 'supposed', 'believe', 'people', 'are', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'Well', 'would', 'believe', 'documentary', 'actually', 'discuss', 'how', 'writer', 'screenplay', 'went', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'City', 'learn', 'movie', 'presumably', 'not', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Ha', 'yet', 'would', 'presume', 'make', 'New', 'York', '_character_', 'movie', 'Puh-lease', 'digress.It', 'especially', 'hard', 'cheer', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'character', 'Erica', 'total', 'wacko', 'What', 'profession', 'sounds', 'City', 'radio', 'monologues', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'artist', 'what', 'kind', 'la-la', 'land', 'fool', 'would', 'actually', 'close', 'eyes', 'lose', 'making', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'scary', 'corner', 'scary', 'park', 'night', 'course', 'horrible', 'attack', 'not', 'help', 'out', 'psychologically', 'contrary', 'just', 'straight', 'downhill', 'been', 'totally', 'wrecked', 'now', 'just', 'kind', 'crazy', 'woman', 'gun.This', 'movie', 'tries', 'be', 'sophisticated', 'tries', 'achieve', 'brilliant', 'complexity', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'just', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'Not', 'even', 'same', 'ballpark', 'Unfortunately', 'lofty', 'ambitions', 'also', 'obfuscate', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'simple', 'visceral', 'effective', 'revenge', 'movie', 'Death', 'Wish', 'cluttering', 'up', 'kinds', 'extra', 'baloney', 'just', 'drag', 'down', 'lameness', 'bad', 'episode', 'CSI']",N/A

Besides the very excellent action story featuring an abundance of action and violence, this story has a lot to say about never being able to return to who you were prior to being made the victim of a violent crime.The story makes a convincing case for the idea that extreme trauma almost always prevents one from returning to that innocent ""person"", or possessing that tranquil state of mind he or she believed they were in prior to being a victim of violence.  That person is dead and gone, always replaced by a new person having no ""illusions"" or ideals about safety, truth or justice.The question is how to proceed from that point on.

1125475,AZFSJNYKDHIGZ,B0010HOZVW,Kelvin J. Dickinson,"[1, 2]","GUN FURY, FROM MY AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEWSLooking beyond its more 'controversial' aspects, THE BRAVE ONE emerges as a solid and highly atmospheric thriller with consistently great cinematography. In other words, a natural choice for the Blu-ray treatment. In 1080p high-definition the picture quality is stunning, containing a depth of field almost entirely absent from the standard-definition DVD and, I have to admit, that both the dramatic and technical experience stayed with me for some considerable time afterwards - which in my book is usually a good sign of something a bit out of the ordinary.Erica Bain is a New York DJ who, along with her fiance, is brutally attacked and left for dead. She survives, and the only way of coping with her ordeal and her grief is to become a vigilante, wandering the lonely streets of the city and wasting the lowlifes that inhabit its nocturnal underbelly. Complications arise when she strikes up a relationship with the cop who's working on the case...JODIE FOSTER puts in an excellent performance by injecting her character with a real sense of humanity, making the resulting moral ambiguities somewhat easier to accept (unlike, say, Charles Bronson in DEATH WISH, whose one-dimensional expressions gave away practically nothing of the internal struggles that must accompany such behaviour). Yes, there are contrivances in incident and aftermath but the film builds to a powerfully satisfying climax which is largely unexpected, and due in no small part to a tight script and convincing dialogue. Director NEIL JORDAN has painted a rich canvas, mostly without resorting to cliche, and the city at night is both a beautiful and terrifying prospect (someone equally good at this sort of thing is Michael Mann, see COLLATERAL). The onscreen violence, as you might imagine, is gritty but it is also entirely justified - any pulling of punches in that crucial area may have seriously harmed believability from the outset, especially given the petite stature of the main protagonist, so kudos to all concerned for keeping it as real as possible.Overall then, a film with some substance and meaning, dealing with several issues including revenge, self-awareness and confession/redemption. It may take a mental post-mortem to come to those conclusions but, whatever else you do, don't dismiss THE BRAVE ONE as sensationalist nonsense.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",4,ONE TOUGH COOKIE,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,2385,"['GUN', 'FURY', 'FROM', 'MY', 'AMAZON.CO.UK', 'REVIEWSLooking', 'more', ""'controversial"", 'aspects', 'BRAVE', 'ONE', 'solid', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'thriller', 'consistently', 'great', 'cinematography', 'other', 'words', 'natural', 'choice', 'Blu-ray', 'treatment', '1080p', 'high-definition', 'picture', 'quality', 'stunning', 'containing', 'depth', 'field', 'almost', 'entirely', 'absent', 'standard-definition', 'DVD', 'have', 'admit', 'dramatic', 'technical', 'experience', 'stayed', 'considerable', 'time', 'afterwards', 'book', 'usually', 'good', 'sign', 'something', 'bit', 'ordinary.Erica', 'Bain', 'New', 'York', 'DJ', 'who', 'fiance', 'brutally', 'attacked', 'left', 'dead', 'only', 'way', 'coping', 'ordeal', 'grief', 'become', 'vigilante', 'wandering', 'lonely', 'streets', 'city', 'wasting', 'lowlifes', 'nocturnal', 'underbelly', 'Complications', 'arise', 'when', 'up', 'relationship', 'cop', 'who', 'working', 'case', 'JODIE', 'FOSTER', 'excellent', 'performance', 'injecting', 'character', 'real', 'sense', 'humanity', 'making', 'resulting', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'somewhat', 'easier', 'accept', 'say', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'one-dimensional', 'expressions', 'gave', 'away', 'practically', 'nothing', 'internal', 'struggles', 'must', 'accompany', 'such', 'behaviour', 'Yes', 'are', 'contrivances', 'incident', 'aftermath', 'film', 'powerfully', 'satisfying', 'climax', 'largely', 'unexpected', 'due', 'small', 'part', 'tight', 'script', 'convincing', 'dialogue', 'Director', 'NEIL', 'JORDAN', 'painted', 'rich', 'canvas', 'mostly', 'resorting', 'cliche', 'city', 'night', 'beautiful', 'terrifying', 'prospect', 'someone', 'equally', 'good', 'sort', 'thing', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'see', 'COLLATERAL', 'onscreen', 'violence', 'might', 'imagine', 'gritty', 'also', 'entirely', 'justified', 'pulling', 'punches', 'crucial', 'area', 'may', 'have', 'seriously', 'harmed', 'believability', 'outset', 'especially', 'given', 'petite', 'stature', 'main', 'protagonist', 'so', 'kudos', 'concerned', 'keeping', 'as', 'real', 'possible.Overall', 'then', 'film', 'substance', 'meaning', 'dealing', 'several', 'issues', 'including', 'revenge', 'self-awareness', 'confession/redemption', 'may', 'take', 'mental', 'post-mortem', 'come', 'conclusions', 'else', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'THE', 'BRAVE', 'ONE', 'sensationalist', 'nonsense.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

Of course that's not a shock considering that she's great in everything, but this movie as a whole is powerful.  You're a regular person in love and you don't make any trouble.  You have a great job and a lover, but one night as you're both walking your dog and being all lovey dovey you are both attacked by some nasty bully thugs.  Your lover is killed in the process and you are badly injured suffering a concussion.  When you wake up and come to after being knocked out repeatedly by those bigger than you for no reason, you are in a hospital bed and your lover is dead.  What do you do?  In the movie, Jodie Foster who plays the remaining surviver falls into a depression and doesn't want to live naturally.  She makes several trips to the police station and they have no leads and are not that helpful.  She starts changing and takes matters into her own hands.

But Jodie Forster was in it and she's such a fine actor that I love seeing her work on the screen.  She's cast as a vigilante who takes out revenge on all the bad guys who come her way.  The acting is so good, however, that I soon forgot that this was a formula film.  Jodie Forster seems to actually live the psychological terror and helplessness that befall her after her fiance is brutally beaten to death as they walk their dog in Central Park.  Yes, the bad guys are all stereotyped.  I expected that.  And it reflects a scary New York of random violence that existed about 15 years ago and which is different today.  But it didn't take me long to relate to her and, to the director's credit, he kept the scenes short so they didn't weigh down the film.  Terrance Howard, cast as an understanding cop, is someone I admire too.  As the bad guys start dropping he soon becomes suspicious and his relationship with Forster is tense and complicated.Even though I knew the general outline of the plot, I was never bored for a minute.

1125485,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,B0010HOZVW,L. J Nary,"[1, 2]","This movie really drew me in. I could relate to Erica's way of seeing the world after a traumatic experience impacted her whole way of being. She was such a happy person with so much joy to look forward too. She was marrying a man who shared the same amount of energy towards her as she him. They just completely exhibited such completeness. This was so well acted because you only had a few scenes with them both but you got the vibe so well before the actual tragedy hits. The impact leaves Erica played by Foster, in such a way that it takes her identity and reshapes her into a person who is without any of herself much glimpsed. When she goes out into the city after experiencing ptsd, the visuals are used in such a way that reflects trauma. The way the camera plays on the ptsd hits home. The loud sounds, the hyperviglance the way Erica holds her body, all shows what happens after an event that scars an individual. Her reactions to her job and people take on a drastic change and she does seem shut down and on pilot, living her life with impulsive acts of violence. She realizes this and seems to want to be punished for the actions of crime she has committed. There is a dissociation that can be seen in her, and people who have experienced a tramatic event can relate to this. She seems to be impacted by two people and other than them she seems cut off from the world. A detective and a neighbor seem to impact her with words of wisdom that hit home. She seems so angry but it is repressed. When she talks about the killings that have yet to disclose the perpatrator who is secretly her, she seems to be disgusted by the uncaring remarks of her radio audience, they disregard humanity and lack compassion, which suggests a polarity or a split in her. I liked the identification I had with the character and her meditation and reflection in healing. I loved her depth in her words and how she portrayed herself towards the detective and on her radio program. The moment was stronger cus of the impact her words made on others and almost felt like prose. The movie had a dark depth of spirituality to it and even had Sarah Mclauglin music, this particular singer gives off that aura. The movie has the buildup of  revenge and sadness. The movie could be a turnoff to some but the darkness makes it different and creative. The beautiful relationship between the two as reflected in the hospital scene again shows the polarity between pain and exquisite pleasure.

Afraid but determined never to be a victim again, Erica purchases a firearm illegally, and soon finds herself threatened by a man in a convenience store.

Unfortunately, though, there are so many things about this movie that are completely far-fetched, from the outrageous number of dangerous situations Erica finds herself in day after day to the behavior of Howard's character when he finds out exactly what Erica's been up to. It's very disappointing, because ""The Brave One"" has all the makings of a really great movie, but the script itself is really stupid in places, and that ruined the whole film for me.

While women in film are no strangers to violence, they usually don't do the killing themselves, and especially not with a gun.  Foster plays the role of Erica Bain, a hip radio essayist, with the same courage she conjures in Silence of the Lambs.  Bain and her fianc&eacute;, David (played by Naveen Andrews), are attacked during a nightly walk.  David does not survive his injuries, and Bain's life proceeds down a dark and violent path.The unseen protagonist of the film is psychological closure after a traumatic event.  The plot of the film would not occur if the police had brought to justice the men who attacked Bain and David.  It's the need for closure that drives the plot into highly predictable and sometimes unlikely situations.  The film is not a total loss, however, thanks most to Foster and Terrence Howard.  Howard plays the role of Detective Mercer, and in the hands of a lesser actor, Mercer would have appeared as irrelevant as the character truly is.  Howard's charisma and patience won me over, as did Foster's wide-ranging and dynamic characterization.  The subtle love interest between Foster and Howard was well written and well acted.  R-rated films rarely show people interested in each other without forcing them to sleep together.Despite a familiar plot, the movie is highly entertaining, well acted, and at times thought-provoking.  The film does contain scenes of intense violence.

For the most part it is a ""by the numbers"" movie that is not only rather predictable, but also often rather hard to swallow. Several times during the movie I found myself saying things like ""yea right, like that would really happen in real life"", or ""c'mon, give me a break"". Some how Jodie Foster has become the kind of actress that is so respected and so interesting with every new role she takes on that despite the weaknesses of the movie, because she is in it- the whole thing seems rather special. Jodie is truly a wonderful actor and she does just fine here with a rather predictable script. If anyone but Jodie Foster had chosen the role, more than likely this movie would have been considered rather expendable. All in all it was an ok film, but it is one of those movies that delivers exactly what you might expect- nothing more, nothing less. I had hoped for a film with some real dramatic twists and turns. If some like Michael Mann or Maybe even Jonathan Demme had directed this movie it may have been a little better and memorable movie experience. I have always loved Jodie Foster.

1125520,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0010HOZVW,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 13]","***1/2Call it the Sword of Damocles Syndrome of filmmaking, but anytime characters seem just a little too happy at the beginning of a movie we know that some unspeakable catastrophe is just waiting to befall them.In the case of Erica Bain and David Kirmani, that event is catastrophic indeed.  Erica and David are a deliriously contented couple eagerly making plans for their upcoming marriage.  One night, while walking their dog in Central Park, the two are attacked by a gang of hooligans who kill David and leave Erica beaten, battered and clinging to life in a weeks-long coma.  When she wakes up, Erica has trouble coming to terms with the terror brought on by what has happened to her and buys herself an illegal firearm, initially as a means of protecting herself from any future assault.  Quickly, however, she finds another use for the weapon, namely to go roaming around town eliminating any threatening malefactors unfortunate enough to wander across her path.It's impossible to discuss ""The Brave One"" without making at least a passing reference to 1974`s ""Death Wish,"" the archetype for all those urban vigilante melodramas that became so popular in the 1970's and 1980's.  Erica pretty much fits the mold of those earlier antihero figures (despite the one obvious difference that she is a woman), although the writers - Roderick Taylor, Bruce A. Taylor and Cynthia Mort - and director Neil Jordan bring an added psychological dimension to the character (it might be nothing more than pop psychology, for all we know, but at least it's something).  The filmmakers work hard at trying to explore Erica's motives for what she's doing, even if one of the themes of the movie seems to be that there may not BE any real explanation for her actions.  Erica is a woman suffering the ravages of not only the grief of losing her fiance, but the fear, paranoia and psychological dislocation that result from violent trauma.  Erica - who hosts a radio talk show whose theme seems to be reflections on city living - keeps telling both us and her audience that she is no longer the same person she was before the incident and that she will never be that person again.Like ""Death Wish,"" ""The Brave One"" is clearly more of a dark urban fantasy than a work of stark documentary-style realism.  The filmmakers never make the logistics of Erica's killing spree all that convincing, but neither do they descend to the level of cheap exploitative rabblerousing one might expect from such a premise.  The climax is not entirely plausible given the nature of one of the characters, but at least it avoids the easy, pro-law-and-order clich&eacute; it appears at first glance to be on its way to embracing.As Erica, Jodie Foster gets to play the Travis Bickle character this time around (though she is more righteous and considerably less unbalanced than her ""Taxi Driver"" predecessor), purging the city of bad guys and making the streets once again safe for decent, law-abiding citizens.  Her gun-toting Angel of Vengeance character may be a bit of a stereotype at this point, but Foster imbues her with enough humanity and depth to make her interesting.  The pain and torment Erica is feeling is often made palpable for the audience through Foster's multi-layered, emotionally complex performance.  She gets strong support from Terrance Howard, who does stellar work as the compassionate homicide detective assigned to investigate the killings, as well as from Naveen Andrews (""Lost"") and Mary Steenburgen in smaller but nevertheless crucial roles.As a ""study of violence,"" ""The Brave One"" pretty much leaves it up to the viewers to sift through and sort out their own complex feelings on the subject.  The movie neither glorifies nor condemns, neither endorses nor berates Erica for her actions.  It tries to understand her, but it doesn't feel called upon to judge her.  The filmmakers may, indeed, be copping out by not putting forth a clear message on the topic, but this noncommittal approach actually makes the movie more thoughtful and authentic.  Some may be enraged by the film, while others may be enthralled by it.  But few will have no strong opinion on ""The Brave One"" one way or the other - and that's what makes movie watching ultimately worthwhile.",3,implausible but effective revenge melodrama,1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,4256,"['***1/2Call', 'Sword', 'Damocles', 'Syndrome', 'filmmaking', 'anytime', 'characters', 'seem', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'happy', 'beginning', 'movie', 'know', 'unspeakable', 'catastrophe', 'just', 'waiting', 'befall', 'them.In', 'case', 'Erica', 'Bain', 'David', 'Kirmani', 'event', 'catastrophic', 'indeed', 'Erica', 'David', 'are', 'deliriously', 'contented', 'couple', 'eagerly', 'making', 'plans', 'upcoming', 'marriage', 'One', 'night', 'walking', 'dog', 'Central', 'Park', 'two', 'are', 'attacked', 'gang', 'hooligans', 'who', 'kill', 'David', 'leave', 'Erica', 'beaten', 'battered', 'clinging', 'life', 'weeks-long', 'coma', 'When', 'up', 'Erica', 'trouble', 'coming', 'terms', 'terror', 'brought', 'what', 'happened', 'illegal', 'firearm', 'initially', 'means', 'protecting', 'future', 'assault', 'Quickly', 'however', 'use', 'weapon', 'namely', 'go', 'roaming', 'around', 'town', 'eliminating', 'threatening', 'malefactors', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'wander', 'path.It', 'impossible', 'discuss', 'Brave', 'One', 'making', 'least', 'passing', 'reference', '1974', 's', 'Death', 'Wish', 'archetype', 'urban', 'vigilante', 'melodramas', 'became', 'so', 'popular', '1970', '1980', 'Erica', 'pretty', 'much', 'mold', 'earlier', 'antihero', 'figures', 'one', 'obvious', 'difference', 'woman', 'writers', 'Roderick', 'Taylor', 'Bruce', 'A.', 'Taylor', 'Cynthia', 'Mort', 'director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'bring', 'added', 'psychological', 'dimension', 'character', 'might', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'pop', 'psychology', 'know', 'least', 'something', 'filmmakers', 'work', 'hard', 'trying', 'explore', 'Erica', 'motives', 'what', 'doing', 'even', 'one', 'themes', 'movie', 'be', 'may', 'not', 'BE', 'real', 'explanation', 'actions', 'Erica', 'woman', 'suffering', 'ravages', 'not', 'only', 'grief', 'losing', 'fiance', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'psychological', 'dislocation', 'result', 'violent', 'trauma', 'Erica', 'who', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'theme', 'be', 'reflections', 'city', 'living', 'telling', 'audience', 'no', 'longer', 'same', 'person', 'was', 'incident', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'person', 'Death', 'Wish', 'Brave', 'One', 'clearly', 'more', 'dark', 'urban', 'fantasy', 'work', 'stark', 'documentary-style', 'realism', 'filmmakers', 'never', 'make', 'logistics', 'Erica', 'killing', 'spree', 'convincing', 'do', 'descend', 'level', 'cheap', 'exploitative', 'rabblerousing', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'such', 'premise', 'climax', 'not', 'entirely', 'plausible', 'given', 'nature', 'one', 'characters', 'least', 'easy', 'pro-law-and-order', 'clich', 'eacute', 'first', 'glance', 'be', 'way', 'embracing.As', 'Erica', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'play', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'character', 'time', 'more', 'righteous', 'considerably', 'less', 'unbalanced', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'predecessor', 'purging', 'city', 'bad', 'guys', 'making', 'streets', 'once', 'again', 'safe', 'decent', 'law-abiding', 'citizens', 'gun-toting', 'Angel', 'Vengeance', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'stereotype', 'point', 'Foster', 'enough', 'humanity', 'depth', 'make', 'interesting', 'pain', 'torment', 'Erica', 'feeling', 'often', 'made', 'palpable', 'audience', 'Foster', 'multi-layered', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'performance', 'strong', 'support', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'who', 'stellar', 'work', 'compassionate', 'homicide', 'detective', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'killings', 'as', 'well', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Lost', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'smaller', 'nevertheless', 'crucial', 'roles.As', 'study', 'violence', 'Brave', 'One', 'pretty', 'much', 'up', 'viewers', 'sift', 'sort', 'out', 'own', 'complex', 'feelings', 'subject', 'movie', 'glorifies', 'condemns', 'endorses', 'berates', 'Erica', 'actions', 'understand', ""n't"", 'feel', 'called', 'judge', 'filmmakers', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'copping', 'out', 'not', 'putting', 'forth', 'clear', 'message', 'topic', 'noncommittal', 'approach', 'actually', 'movie', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'authentic', 'may', 'be', 'enraged', 'film', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'enthralled', 'few', 'will', 'have', 'strong', 'opinion', 'Brave', 'One', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'what', 'movie', 'watching', 'ultimately', 'worthwhile']",N/A

You have the complicated, slightly twisted protagonist (Erica Bain) who goes to the dark side, as it were, after suffering an inhuman assault that leaves her would-be husband dead.  It leaves her with PTSD and the chilling realization that she has not only the ability but the desire to kill.  Labeling the antagonist of the movie is rather difficult.

1125526,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B0010HOZVW,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 2]","New York City's Night-time radio host, Erica Bain (Jodie Foster), pulls the microphone near and muses to her audience; slowly and hypnotically, in what formerly was the ""safest big city"" and now is a place of personally-guarded, emotional pain.  The phones light-up continually as the audience pours out its comments about the 'City's vigilante hero'. Unbeknownst to all of those over the air-waves; Erica is just as unable to accept this claim onto herself as she is haunted by her inability to stop...Erica and boyfriend David (Naveen Andrews) left together, along with their dog, for a walk at dusk in Central Park.  They were happily in love, and readying to marry, as they were attacked just shortly into their stroll.  David was brutally beaten to death and graphically filmed by a murderous group of thugs.Erica barely escaped with her life.  She awoke three-weeks later in the hospital, only to find her betrothed was now gone and she must go on without him.  The subsequent effects of that trauma overtake her; she finds herself terrified, isolated in her apartment, and in fear for her life.After a short while, the City and radio audience beckons her.  Quickly purchasing an illegal 9mm handgun for her own protection, Erica panics.  While in a convenience store, she is confronted with a threatening situation right-away.  You can hear a pin drop as Erica is forced to show her hand, and in sharp response to the threat, must take a life.  This action, in turn, leads to another situation on the Subway, then still another.  By now, is she avenging David or is she out of control?Internalizing her grief and pain while externalizing her anger into vengeance; Erica walks the sleepless City's streets every night, while silently screaming - ""Why don't they stop me?""",5,"""I'm  Just  A  Voice""  -  Erica Bain",1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,1777,"['New', 'York', 'City', 'Night-time', 'radio', 'host', 'Erica', 'Bain', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'microphone', 'muses', 'audience', 'slowly', 'hypnotically', 'what', 'formerly', 'was', 'safest', 'big', 'city', 'now', 'place', 'personally-guarded', 'emotional', 'pain', 'phones', 'light-up', 'continually', 'audience', 'out', 'comments', ""'City"", 'vigilante', 'hero', 'air-waves', 'Erica', 'just', 'as', 'unable', 'accept', 'claim', 'haunted', 'inability', 'stop', 'Erica', 'boyfriend', 'David', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'left', 'together', 'dog', 'walk', 'dusk', 'Central', 'Park', 'were', 'happily', 'love', 'readying', 'marry', 'were', 'attacked', 'just', 'shortly', 'stroll', 'David', 'was', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'death', 'graphically', 'filmed', 'murderous', 'group', 'thugs.Erica', 'barely', 'escaped', 'life', 'awoke', 'three-weeks', 'later', 'hospital', 'only', 'find', 'betrothed', 'was', 'now', 'gone', 'must', 'go', 'subsequent', 'effects', 'trauma', 'overtake', 'terrified', 'isolated', 'apartment', 'fear', 'life.After', 'short', 'while', 'City', 'radio', 'audience', 'beckons', 'Quickly', 'purchasing', 'illegal', '9mm', 'handgun', 'own', 'protection', 'Erica', 'panics', 'convenience', 'store', 'confronted', 'threatening', 'situation', 'right-away', 'can', 'hear', 'pin', 'drop', 'Erica', 'forced', 'show', 'hand', 'sharp', 'response', 'threat', 'must', 'take', 'life', 'action', 'turn', 'situation', 'Subway', 'then', 'still', 'now', 'avenging', 'David', 'control', 'Internalizing', 'grief', 'pain', 'externalizing', 'anger', 'vengeance', 'Erica', 'sleepless', 'City', 'streets', 'night', 'silently', 'screaming', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop']",N/A

And that's not too far off plotwise.We all know what happened in 1974's Death Wish, right? InDeath Wishsome hoodlums put the hurt on Charles Bronson's family and Bronson goes Medieval on New York City's bad guys with a roll of quarters in a sock and a gun.Well Death Wish didn't win any big awards, but it was certainly a cult classic that holds up to this day. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised to see Jodie Foster nab a nomination (from the MTV Movie Awards at minimum) for her role as Paul Kersey...er...um...I mean Erica ""Pain"" Bain.Foster really is a great actress and she makes you feel the agony that she is going through after the loss of a loved one. She also does an A-list job of taking a personality from Princess Leia to The Dark Side of the Force.Terrence Howard (who's in more movies in 2007 & 2008 than anyone I think) plays a cool, enjoyable to watch detective with his own mini side-story. But the key is that all of the side stories--and there really aren't that many--take a back seat to the primary script. The script that drew so many to the simple concept of Death Wish. The vigilante on the loose.The story is well-told and focuses on Foster's acts of retribution as much as the moral dilemma of being brutally violated, then taking severe action against the violating crowd, but questioning yourself and being questioned by the public for your response to the original attack committed against you (Hey, remind you any current events?).Director Neil Jordan keeps the action real enough in The Brave One so as to make you think you've got a window into something-that-is-really-happening. There are a couple of over the top sequences...especially in the last 15 or so minutes...but otherwise, the emotion, suspense and tense situations will keep you in your seat and thoroughly entertained for its full 2 hour runtime.The Brave One was definitely worth the trip off the couch and out to the theater.

That is the story in a nutshell, but there are more twists and turns to the plot than my description would suggest and which I won't elaborate on to prevent spoilers. I've never been a huge fan of Foster, but her performance in this film was surprisingly good and you really get a sense of her characters fears and motivation for justice that impelled her actions. This film felt quite slow at times, but I was still kept engaged throughout. Some of the violence was quite upsetting and/or graphic, mainly the attack at the start of the film and this was a particularly hard hitting scene. This film uses some clever direction to enhance some scenes, like interspersing a love scene with a hospital scene, which made the brutality of the damage caused by the attack all the more powerful in counterpoint to the tenderness in the love scene. Overall, if you like crime films this should be right up your street and for a stellar performance from Foster this is the place to go.

1125536,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0010HOZVW,Stephanie De Pue,"[5, 7]","""The Brave One,"" (2007), an action/crime/drama/thriller, starring Jodie Foster, follows in a long line of distinguished genre pictures from Warner Bros. Studios.  It also, as most everybody has noticed, follows a long line of revenge genre pictures, best known of which is probably Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish,"" also set in New York City.  With Irish director Neil Jordan contributing his usual thoughtful work at the helm, the picture achieved Golden Globe nominations, and Foster, who pretty much carries it, pulls this picture out of the run-of-the-mill.  She received great, deserved, praise for this performance.Foster plays Erica Bain, a successful Manhattanite with a great job,sounds of the city type radio reporter; boss, boyfriend, and apartment: each so desirable, in the best Hollywood tradition, that I'm not sure any exist in actuality.  She has a handsome doctor boyfriend, David Kirmani (Naveen Andrews).  She has a wonderful boss, Carol (Mary Steenburgen), at the public radio station where she works, who is certainly more understanding than any boss I've ever been lucky enough to have.  So Bain's got it made.  But that, of course, can change in a heartbeat.  Things go wrong, as they sometimes do, one night in Central Park: Bain takes a severe beating that leaves her in coma for three weeks; her boyfriend, beaten to death, and their dog, stolen. So that when she comes out of the coma, she wants justice, or, barring that, revenge.  The police, Detectives Mercer (Terrence Howard), and Vitale (Nicky Katt), seem unable to help her; she therefore soon takes matters into her own hands.Foster, who is said to now accept only proactive roles originally written for men, is, like Barbara Stanwyck before her, pushing at the boundaries of what women can do in pictures, and she delivers a powerhouse, yet finely-tuned, performance.  Mind you, the perpetrators, throughout, are as undifferentiated and stereotypical as they ever were in any Warners' ""B"" movie.  Finally, Terrence Howard is excellent as the detective.  Like many men in Jordan films, he yearns after an inappropriate love object - how can he, a dedicated policeman, keep company with a woman he suspects of being a serial killer?As is true of other genre pictures, ""The Brave One,"" depends on its characters behaving thoughtlessly to start the action.  Any seasoned New Yorker will tell you that even the most passionate of lovers had better not lose focus at night, in a dark, little-populated Central Park, under a threatening overpass: it's just not the time nor place for a cuddle.

1125537,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B0010HOZVW,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[20, 25]","A powerful and Oscar worthy performance by Jodie Foster is unfortunately overlooked because far too many associated this film with Charles Bronson's classicDeath Wish.While there are definitely similar themes in both films and strong performance are given by both leads, this film is far more cerebral with its approach than Bronson's film.  We feel Foster's pain more via her bravura performance and especially since as a radio DJ she has the unique opportunity to air her thoughts on the subject at hand, vigilantism, and hear how others think of her actions (without realizing they are actually speaking to the vigilante herself).  This puts a powerful psychological spin on the story often lacking in other similarly themed films.I also found the title intriguing as it may be asking a question more than defining a character here.  Foster's Erica Bane, clever choice in last name which means burden or cause of ruin, is conflicted over whether her actions are praise-worthy or even brave as both topics come up on her radio talk show.  Her reaction is bewilderment to think others think she is brave when she believes she is acting out of fear, and disgust for those that think she is ""doing the city a favor"" somehow or for finding her behavior easy.She does her actions as a compulsion to rectify a wrong, to vent, and, yes, get revenge.  She does not believe she is ""helping"" the city and is angry at that perception and with herself for this obsession that is now invading every part of her being.  These criminals who hurt her have taken more than her finance, they have taken her peace of mind and a chunk of her life and she is angry that many don't understand this.  She feels very misunderstood by most except for a detective, excellently portrayed by Terrance Howard, who is on to her, but very sympathetic as he is something of a tortured soul himself.The film explores just who is brave here.  Is it Bane for facing her anger, for finding a manner in which to vent, for seeking resolution, for simply surviving her harrowing encounter, or is it the power that a gun gives one.  It's easy to be brave with a gun in your hand is an underlying message in this story as it was in a famous novel I just finished teaching my students this week.  Atticus Finch said in Harper Lee'sTo Kill a Mockingbirdto his son Jem who watched an old woman die facing a battle most could not or would not face themselves and said, ""I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand.""  Courage isn't measured by how many bullets one has, but by how one faces a struggle in which one can't win.Foster's Bane seem to feel great anger at herself for the control that she has allowed some criminals to have over her life and for the power she was finding in a gun.  Isn't this why some carry a gun?  For power?  For control?  For their notion on what justice is or ought to be?Who is the brave one?Sadly, it isn't the writer or director who choose to take an emotionally charged and intelligently developed story and go down a trite, contrived, and completely unrealistic resolution to a story as provocative as this one started out as and could have and should have ended as such.  Those who like their stories to end with a neat bow will be pleased, but others who prefer realism and honesty in films will resent the cheap cowardly ending this film contains and that is my only reason for this film getting four stars instead of five and perhaps why it got snubbed at the Oscars even though Foster's performance and Terrance Howard as the detective keeping tabs on her are completely flawless even with the silly ending they are forced to act out with a straight face.",4,The Brave One: A most appropriate title for this film.,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,3725,"['powerful', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'unfortunately', 'overlooked', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'associated', 'film', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'classicDeath', 'are', 'definitely', 'similar', 'themes', 'films', 'strong', 'performance', 'are', 'given', 'leads', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'cerebral', 'approach', 'Bronson', 'film', 'feel', 'Foster', 'pain', 'more', 'bravura', 'performance', 'especially', 'radio', 'DJ', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'air', 'thoughts', 'subject', 'hand', 'vigilantism', 'hear', 'how', 'others', 'think', 'actions', 'realizing', 'are', 'actually', 'speaking', 'vigilante', 'powerful', 'psychological', 'spin', 'story', 'often', 'lacking', 'other', 'similarly', 'themed', 'films.I', 'also', 'found', 'title', 'intriguing', 'may', 'be', 'asking', 'question', 'more', 'defining', 'character', 'here', 'Foster', 'Erica', 'Bane', 'clever', 'choice', 'last', 'name', 'burden', 'cause', 'ruin', 'conflicted', 'actions', 'are', 'praise-worthy', 'even', 'brave', 'topics', 'come', 'up', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'reaction', 'bewilderment', 'think', 'others', 'think', 'brave', 'when', 'acting', 'fear', 'disgust', 'think', 'doing', 'city', 'favor', 'somehow', 'finding', 'behavior', 'easy.She', 'actions', 'compulsion', 'rectify', 'wrong', 'vent', 'yes', 'get', 'revenge', 'not', 'believe', 'helping', 'city', 'angry', 'perception', 'obsession', 'now', 'invading', 'part', 'being', 'criminals', 'who', 'hurt', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'finance', 'have', 'taken', 'peace', 'mind', 'chunk', 'life', 'angry', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'very', 'misunderstood', 'most', 'detective', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'who', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'something', 'tortured', 'soul', 'himself.The', 'film', 'explores', 'just', 'who', 'brave', 'here', 'Bane', 'facing', 'anger', 'finding', 'manner', 'vent', 'seeking', 'resolution', 'simply', 'surviving', 'harrowing', 'encounter', 'power', 'gun', 'one', 'easy', 'be', 'brave', 'gun', 'hand', 'underlying', 'message', 'story', 'was', 'famous', 'novel', 'just', 'finished', 'teaching', 'students', 'week', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'said', 'Harper', ""Lee'sTo"", 'Kill', 'Mockingbirdto', 'son', 'Jem', 'who', 'watched', 'old', 'woman', 'facing', 'battle', 'most', 'could', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'face', 'said', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'real', 'courage', 'instead', 'getting', 'idea', 'courage', 'man', 'gun', 'hand', 'Courage', ""n't"", 'measured', 'how', 'many', 'bullets', 'one', 'how', 'one', 'struggle', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win.Foster', 'Bane', 'seem', 'feel', 'great', 'anger', 'control', 'allowed', 'criminals', 'have', 'over', 'life', 'power', 'was', 'finding', 'gun', ""n't"", 'why', 'carry', 'gun', 'power', 'control', 'notion', 'what', 'justice', 'ought', 'be', 'Who', 'brave', 'one', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'writer', 'director', 'who', 'choose', 'take', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'intelligently', 'developed', 'story', 'go', 'down', 'trite', 'contrived', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'resolution', 'story', 'as', 'provocative', 'one', 'started', 'out', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'such', 'who', 'like', 'stories', 'end', 'neat', 'bow', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'others', 'who', 'prefer', 'realism', 'honesty', 'films', 'will', 'resent', 'cheap', 'cowardly', 'ending', 'film', 'only', 'reason', 'film', 'getting', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'perhaps', 'why', 'got', 'snubbed', 'Oscars', 'even', 'Foster', 'performance', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'detective', 'keeping', 'tabs', 'are', 'completely', 'flawless', 'even', 'silly', 'ending', 'are', 'forced', 'act', 'out', 'straight', 'face']",N/A

Sorry for letting out the spoiler but that is precisely how you are going to feel when you see the ending (provided you have already seen Sudden Impact). The story of a lone female killer seeking revenge is almost the same though some phsycological changes to the main character have been made in The Brave One. Unlike Sondra Locke's character in Sudden Impact, Jodie Foster's character in The Brave One seems to have a dual personality. The role is powerfully potrayed no doubt and both Jodie and Terence Howard who plays the detective enact good performances.

1125545,AUB7WXM7IX81,B0010HOZVW,Timothy I. Morgan Jr.,"[13, 25]","Contrived doesn't even begin to describe this botched attempt to replicate the moral underpinnings of films like ""Death Wish.""  ""The Brave One"" attempts, unsuccessfully, to examine the ambiguities surrounding one individual's decision to turn to vigilantism, including the effects it has on one's soul.  The result is a contorted mess with mixed messages that fail to provoke any real thought over the issues that should have been addressed in a more substantive way here.Jodie Foster, who plays radio personality Erica Bain, headlines this confused film and comes off ineffectively, despite her attempts to imbue her character with real emotion while driven by fear.  This is undercut by the coldness that consumes Erica sporadically throughout most of the film.  Some will argue that this adds layers to her performance, but it's really more a case of the script wanting to have it both ways - it demands the necessity of urban justice while commanding bloodlust.  In either case, she leaves behind a trail of bodies after undertaking a personal mission to seek out the various creeps the city of New York manages to hold.Terrance Howard attempts to portray the conflicted detective investigating this series of bodies Foster leaves in her wake.  While doing this, he somehow develops an extremely improbable relationship of sorts with her.  In the process, he violates just about every professional and ethical boundary possible when confiding in her, short of taking matters into his own hands, which we can tell he really wants to do.  He reveals intimate details about his cases, some of which involve her; in more than one of these instances, he is fully aware of this connection, but chooses to ignore it.  Is this the screenplay's way of saying that he implicitly wants her to carry out her newfound form of justice?  There is an answer to this question, but its presence is sloppy and incredible.Nothing in this movie is really credible though.  How is it that Erica managed to live a tranquil lives in New York City for so many years, yet after her fianc&eacute; is killed (I'm spoiling nothing here, since this happens 15 minutes into the movie, after a rushed and trite attempt to develop their relationship) she is confronted with numerous opportunities for violence?  True, she does seek some of these out, but not all of them.  She falls into half these situations by pure contrivance.  ""Death Wish"" suffered from a similar problem, but it dealt with it more intelligently.  That particular Charles Bronson vehicle was no masterpiece, but it was certainly better and more nuanced (if that's possible) than what's on display here.""The Brave One"" fails on just about every level, especially with its preposterous ending.  Character development is sub-par, the scripting is even worse, as is a lot of the dialogue, the acting is inconsistent, and the themes do not run the least bit deep.

Her fiance ends up not surviving, and as we see Erica attempting to return to the activities that once defined her life, we see a psychological unfolding take place as fear and paranoia consumes a woman once so confident. She purchases a gun for protection, and when she returns to work, she almost can't speak until she begins to reveal her deepest thoughts, ""You feel like fear was there all along once it hits you, as if it was always waiting beneath the surfaces of everything you love."" Erica does become a vigilante, and through the Hitchcock quality of the film with a sort of character study, we feel the suspense and shock of how far she'll go to protect herself. The scene in the subway is most powerful. ""Why don't my hands shake?"" she asks herself. The scene where she saves a prostitute from a sleazy thug may seem a little over the top, but not if you understand how everything becomes personal for her, as well as a sense that she wants somebody to stop her. The ending may feel a little too unrealistic when the detective comes to her rescue and allows certain events to occur, but it is believeable if you watch the chemistry between him and Erica. It's not hard to detect that these two remind each other of a past love. Both Foster and Terrance Howard are wonderful together and help add some heart to the film.

She does not let her life be dissected by tabloids. She is 45, but still lands lead roles in major films despite Hollywood's obsession with youth. She generally makes one movie per year. So, when I saw her name appearing on posters and in trailers I was excited. I could not help but anticipate what film she would have picked after her massive hit Flightplan. After seeing The Brave One I felt she picked bravely, yet wisely.The films opens with the crisp, clear voice of Foster narrating against montage of random shots of New York city, and we learn that she has her own radio show about New York.  When she and her fianc&eacute; are brutally mugged while taking an evening walk in a park, she is left in a come for three weeks, while her fianc&eacute; is buried. When she finally does wake up from the coma and learns what has happened she descends into a deep, hopeless depression.Not recovering from the shock of the horrible attack she buys a gun for protection, but a trip to a convenience store has her already using it for the first time. After this brief incident she starts walking the streets at night to fight her insomnia and deal with the terrifying nightmares she has. She strikes up an unlikely friendship with the detective (played by Terence Howard) investigating her killings. As their relationship builds so does the suspense, which all comes to thundering stop in the final fight.Playing a woman who is in an impossible dilemma once again, Foster manages to bring something different to her role escaping a typecast. This time she delves into the psych of her character with a brooding energy. Terrence Howard (Crash, Pride) playing the detective does very well in his role.My only complaint with the film was the ending. It seemed that it was possibly a studio re-cut, because it had that feeling of trying to satisfy rather than braving the outrage of audiences that might have come had the ending been different.Despite that this was a very stirring, powerful film. I was greatly relieved as I watched it that it did not turn into a stylish action film with a death toll to rival Braveheart's battles, but dealt more with the reasons someone might turn to violence after being effected so cruelly by it. I also liked how it did not preach to us about our societies infatuation with violence, nor did it take a stand about whether the choices this woman made were right or wrong, but instead left it up for us to be the judge and decide.

1125551,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0010HOZVW,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","It's a revenge story set in New York City. It sounds like a female version of ""Death Wish"" at first sight, but things are more complicated as ""The Brave One"" stars Jodie Foster as Erica Bain, whose terrible experiences in the park turn her from a radio talk show host living happily into a one-woman vigilante squad. Among many A-list actresses that you can think of, Jodie Foster would be the most unlikely one to be seen in such a revenge story.But she is, and she is very good as you expect. The film gives Erica several occasions (pretty conveniently, I am afraid) to use her weapon, but the strength of ""The Brave One"" directed by Neil Jordan lies not only in suspense surrounding her ""missions,"" but in how crimes (including Erica's) change her personality. Violence is depicted as it is, not glorified in any way and what she does is also often described as nasty and Jodie Foster is excellent showing her character's changes.So far the film is great. Neil Jordan also emphasizes the relations between Erica and the police detective (Terrence Howard), which is another merit. Unfortunately, however, reliable supports like Mary Steenburgen and Jane Adams (especially the latter) has virtually nothing to do.But I was disappointed with the final 20 minutes where the film becomes something different (though I cannot tell exactly how here). All I can say is that ""Death Wish"" is often accused of being a crowd pleaser, but ""The Brave One"" looks as if it wants to please us more. Very realistic depictions of crime and its victims are turned into a concluding sequence which is simply unbelievable in more than one way.Please see it for yourself if you want to know what I mean.

In The Brave One, her portrayal of Erica Bain is perfectly drawn with neither too much nor too little given to the character. There is a controlled pitch in her movements and in her voice which so graphically communicates her need to hide from the rest of the world. After she and her fiance (Naveen Andrews) are severely beaten during a walk in Central Park, she is told that he has died. The memorial services took place while she remained in a coma so there was no opportunity for closure. The balance of the movie gives the viewer a close look at her recovery, both physical and emotional. An extraordinary relationship develops between Erica and a detective(Det. Mercer played by Terrence Howard) who is investigating a spate of killings in the city. It turns out that he is a closeted fan of Erica's radio program which offers a darker, edgier perspective on the city (""the safest big city""). There is a feeling of familiarity he experiences as a result of having been an avid listener to her program. Both he and Erica find in each other, that one person in whom to confide with an honesty usually reserved for more intimate relationships. As the story progresses, the relationship between Erica and Det. Mercer becomes key as her interest in his work on the aforementioned killings begin to catch her interest both personally and professionally.Within the context of such a strong story told so well, Terrence Howard and Jodie Foster are particularly adept at drawing our emotions out. There is an emotional investment that the viewer feels in both characters  and you end up caring about what happens to both. The details with which director Neil Jordan concerns himself make the difference between great and good! Loose ends are tied up in their due time. The viewer never feels cheated.I watch a lot of movies and unfortunately there are a lot of mediocre efforts out there.

1125555,A3GW8QZGHT5K2B,B0010HOZVW,W. D. Payne,"[0, 0]","One of the threads in this movie that hasn't been fully explored is the fact that Erica is dropping hints along the way to Detective Mercer. This film is filled with subtleties. She feels her guilt very deeply and she wants to be caught but fears the consequences. She asks ""why doesn't somebody stop me?"" Watch as she goes to the fringes of the crowd after the subway incident and allows herself to be seen. Then asks for an interview. All through the movie she drops hints. In the lobby when Mercer is waiting for her to show, she sees him but reverses course and walks away but looks over her shoulder. An action that could show guilt to a paranoid police detective. There are others. For instance in the parking garage scene when she calls Mercer and allows him to hear the elevator ding as she waits for her intended victim, which by the way is the first ""murder"" she commits. Her first victims could be called self defense. Near the end Mercer knows who she is and what she's done when they talk in the diner. Leaving she says ""you catch everything"". Very indicative.

Jodie Foster did a great job playing her character, doesn't she always? But some of the other actors seemed like they were nervous, or just need more acting lessons.  It's hard to get into a movie when the actors don't seem like they know what they're doing.  There were too many improbablities in the plot, too many to name.  The dialogue was amatuer as well.  Like the whole ""radiohead"" thing they kept repeating, please give me a break. And the voice over narration by Jodie Foster sounded like bad poetry, that kind of poetry went out in the 80's.  It's like the script was written by a high school drop out.
