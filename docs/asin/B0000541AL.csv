Of course, the viewers know that Susan has just committed a cold-blooded murder by sticking an icepick through some poor guy's heart! This guy just happens to have been a ranch hand on the very ranch that Susan has now ""stumbled"" upon. Susan is a woman on a mission, and the family has no idea that she knows who they are. She's also brought along her childhood doll, and she talks to it...a lot! The only one who is suspicious of Susan is the daughter. She smells a rat. Everyone else is oblivious. Junior even takes Susan to his cave hideaway, and shows her the bottomless pit he's discovered! Of course, no one else knows about it, and it could come in mighty handy for Susan! It's pretty obvious what Susan's up to, and why she's picked this particular family. Still, the tension builds well, and Roth's character is sly and diabolical. She's eeevil, and doesn't have any qualms about killing anyone in her way.

566237,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B0000541AL,Carlisle Wheeling,"[1, 1]","Meet Susan Heller (Andrea Roth).  She's beautiful, sexy, smart, crazy as bat excrement, and I LIKE her!  Susan is a very angry woman.  Her birth mother gave her up for adoption after her father was killed in Vietnam, so Susan has tracked her and her family down in revenge for the awful childhood she had in various foster homes.  One thing is for sure; nothing is going to get in her way. Not the ranch hand she has to kill in order to get his job on the family's land, not the ranch foreman who has lusty designs on her, not the nurse who recognizes her as Karen from the mental hospital, and certainly not her stepsister Linda who doesn't like her from the very start.  After all, what recourse do you have left when nobody will give you a job because you were in a mental institution on account of all the damage done?She charms her way into the family by faking a car accident, earning all but Linda's trust, and carrying on dialog with the doll she's had since she was a child.  Yup.  Ooh-wee-ooh!  Needless to say, Linda is checking her out behind her back while she's busy saying those crazy comical things after each murder, not unlike in Daddy's Girl and Devil in the Flesh.  It's  all quite predictable, and Gil Gerrard isn't in one of his most shining moments as her stepfather, but thanks to Andrea Roth's excellent performance as a deranged psychopath, the movie is fun and worth a watch or two.  While I felt sorry for her birth mother and the slow son named Buddy, I was irritated by Linda's meddling until close to the end.  LOL, I was actually rooting for our Susan until she gave her mother that bath.  If you get the chance, check this one out.  You won't be surprised, but you'll be entertained in a Lifetime with bad language campy sort of way.",4,"Nothing Original, but Loads of Fun.",1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,1766,"['Meet', 'Susan', 'Heller', 'Andrea', 'Roth', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'smart', 'crazy', 'bat', 'excrement', 'LIKE', 'Susan', 'very', 'angry', 'woman', 'birth', 'mother', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'Vietnam', 'so', 'Susan', 'tracked', 'family', 'down', 'revenge', 'awful', 'childhood', 'had', 'various', 'foster', 'homes', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'nothing', 'going', 'get', 'way', 'Not', 'ranch', 'hand', 'kill', 'order', 'get', 'job', 'family', 'land', 'not', 'ranch', 'foreman', 'who', 'lusty', 'designs', 'not', 'nurse', 'who', 'Karen', 'mental', 'hospital', 'certainly', 'not', 'stepsister', 'Linda', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'start', 'what', 'recourse', 'do', 'have', 'left', 'when', 'nobody', 'will', 'give', 'job', 'were', 'mental', 'institution', 'account', 'damage', 'done', 'way', 'family', 'faking', 'car', 'accident', 'earning', 'Linda', 'trust', 'carrying', 'dialog', 'doll', 'had', 'was', 'child', 'Yup', 'Ooh-wee-ooh', 'Needless', 'say', 'Linda', 'checking', 'out', 'back', 'busy', 'saying', 'crazy', 'comical', 'things', 'murder', 'not', 'Daddy', 'Girl', 'Devil', 'Flesh', 'quite', 'predictable', 'Gil', 'Gerrard', ""n't"", 'one', 'most', 'shining', 'moments', 'stepfather', 'thanks', 'Andrea', 'Roth', 'excellent', 'performance', 'deranged', 'psychopath', 'movie', 'fun', 'worth', 'watch', 'two', 'felt', 'sorry', 'birth', 'mother', 'slow', 'son', 'named', 'Buddy', 'was', 'irritated', 'Linda', 'meddling', 'close', 'end', 'LOL', 'was', 'actually', 'rooting', 'Susan', 'gave', 'mother', 'bath', 'get', 'chance', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', 'Lifetime', 'bad', 'language', 'campy', 'sort', 'way']",The Stepdaughter
