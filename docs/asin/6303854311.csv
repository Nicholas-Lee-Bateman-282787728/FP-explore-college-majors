Andersen,"[1, 1]","Rodgers and Hammerstein only contributed six songs to their only original film musical but one of those songs became the Oscar-winning classic, IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SPRING.  It is also the only song that grows out of the  character and plot. The others are, uncharacteristically for R&amp;H, just  songs that could have been written for any film. The story is slight, the  direction and performances are plesant, and it adds up to just another  competent Fox Technicolor musical.  Also nominated for Best Original Score  by the Academy. Note: Compare it with the stark and dramatic original 1933  film - the best of all three versions - and the CinemaScope remake of 1962  with Pat Boone and Ann-Margret (a horror).  This latter was available on  video for about five years, then nose dove into oblivion.  It did contain  five songs written solely by Richard Rodgers.

386837,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6303854311,Bobby Underwood,"[39, 42]","This warm and wonderful film is one of the truly great American musicals, yet is also the least talked about. A terrific cast and some of the best songs Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II ever gave birth to make this Walter Lang film a real treat. It will always bring a smile to your face no matter how many times you see it. It is much like ""On Moonlight Bay"" in that it is a fine family film with a rural setting, nearly bursting with  traditional American values. The fact that it contains some great songs that are worked into the story in a natural and not artificial way is a big bonus.The Frake family in Iowa are all ready for their annual and much beloved trip to the State Fair. Young and pretty Margy Frake (Jeanne Crain) is excited that she might meet the fella that will change her life. Her brother Wayne (Dick Haymes) has been practicing the ring-toss all year so he can get even with the carny who gave him a bum prize last year. Their pa, Abel (Charles Winninger), is excited about his pet boar, Blueboy, winning the grand prize this year. Percy Kilbride has a fine part as Abel's old pal, Dave Miller. They have a five dollar bet on whether they'll all have a good time at the fair this year.Their mother, Melissa (Fay Bainter), is entering her pickles and mincemeat and has dreams that she will win this year over the snooty Mrs. Metcalf. Pa sneaks some brandy into her mincemeat when she's not looking that might just give her the edge this year. Donald Meek has a funny role as one of the judges, Hippenstahl, who is delighted by the taste, and the aftereffects, of Melissa's mincemeat!Dana Andrews is a reporter for the Des Moines Register named Pat, who thinks he's seen the world until he meets the sweet Margy. They spend the three days together as much as possible, but once their time is over, he is on his way to Chicago for a big promotion. Margy loves him, of course, and he may discover he can't live without her either.Wayne will meet and have a romance of sorts with a beautiful singer, Emily Edwards (Vivian Blane). But his taste of the real world will make him appreciate his girl back home, Eleanor (Jane Nigh). It is very funny as he and his sister make up excuses to ditch each other and have their romances. Even Blueboy gets hit by the love bug, as the ""pretty"" Esmerelda catches his eye!The spectacle and fun of the State Fair and what it means in the lives of the Frake family is captured beautifully by the color photography of Leon Shamroy. It should get listed as one of the stars of this film. Adapted by Sonya Levien and Paul Green from a novel by Philip Stong, this is a heartwarming and happy look at America's heartland and all that is good about our past.Songs like ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" and ""It's A Grand Night For Singing"" are easy to take and don't seem forced at all. You never get that ""they're going to sing now"" feel for any of the numbers. They are very enjoyable and help move the story along. ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" won the Academy Award. The music is marvelous, and so is this film.Everyone is just great here, with the lovely Jeanne Crain a particular standout. Harry Morgan has a nice bit as the carny Wayne gets even with, and if you look quick for Coleen Grey you might catch her. Charles Winninger is winning, as are Fay Bainter and Dick Haymes. Percy Kilbride was always amusing and this was one of Dana Andrews' best roles after the magnificent ""Laura.""This film will make you nostalgic. It has the feel of sitting on your front porch in the middle of summer with a glass of iced tea, the scent of honeysuckle in the air and Virginia Creepers twisting around the arbor. This is one of the best American musicals and one you don't want to miss.",5,Warm and Wonderful,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,3731,"['warm', 'wonderful', 'film', 'one', 'truly', 'great', 'American', 'musicals', 'also', 'least', 'talked', 'terrific', 'cast', 'best', 'songs', 'Richard', 'Rogers', 'Oscar', 'Hammerstein', 'II', 'ever', 'gave', 'birth', 'make', 'Walter', 'Lang', 'film', 'real', 'treat', 'will', 'always', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'much', 'Moonlight', 'Bay', 'fine', 'family', 'film', 'rural', 'setting', 'nearly', 'bursting', 'traditional', 'American', 'values', 'fact', 'great', 'songs', 'are', 'worked', 'story', 'natural', 'not', 'artificial', 'way', 'big', 'bonus.The', 'Frake', 'family', 'Iowa', 'are', 'ready', 'annual', 'much', 'beloved', 'trip', 'State', 'Fair', 'Young', 'pretty', 'Margy', 'Frake', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'excited', 'might', 'meet', 'fella', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'brother', 'Wayne', 'Dick', 'Haymes', 'been', 'practicing', 'ring-toss', 'year', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'even', 'carny', 'who', 'gave', 'bum', 'prize', 'last', 'year', 'Their', 'pa', 'Abel', 'Charles', 'Winninger', 'excited', 'pet', 'boar', 'Blueboy', 'winning', 'grand', 'prize', 'year', 'Percy', 'Kilbride', 'fine', 'part', 'Abel', 'old', 'pal', 'Dave', 'Miller', 'have', 'five', 'dollar', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'fair', 'year.Their', 'mother', 'Melissa', 'Fay', 'Bainter', 'entering', 'pickles', 'mincemeat', 'dreams', 'will', 'win', 'year', 'snooty', 'Mrs.', 'Metcalf', 'Pa', 'brandy', 'mincemeat', 'when', 'not', 'looking', 'might', 'just', 'give', 'edge', 'year', 'Donald', 'Meek', 'funny', 'role', 'one', 'judges', 'Hippenstahl', 'who', 'delighted', 'taste', 'aftereffects', 'Melissa', 'mincemeat', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'reporter', 'Des', 'Moines', 'Register', 'named', 'Pat', 'who', 'seen', 'world', 'sweet', 'Margy', 'spend', 'three', 'days', 'together', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'once', 'time', 'over', 'way', 'Chicago', 'big', 'promotion', 'Margy', 'course', 'may', 'discover', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'either.Wayne', 'will', 'meet', 'have', 'romance', 'sorts', 'beautiful', 'singer', 'Emily', 'Edwards', 'Vivian', 'Blane', 'taste', 'real', 'world', 'will', 'make', 'appreciate', 'girl', 'back', 'home', 'Eleanor', 'Jane', 'Nigh', 'very', 'funny', 'sister', 'make', 'up', 'excuses', 'ditch', 'other', 'have', 'romances', 'Even', 'Blueboy', 'hit', 'love', 'bug', 'pretty', 'Esmerelda', 'eye', 'spectacle', 'fun', 'State', 'Fair', 'what', 'lives', 'Frake', 'family', 'captured', 'beautifully', 'color', 'photography', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'should', 'get', 'listed', 'one', 'stars', 'film', 'Adapted', 'Sonya', 'Levien', 'Paul', 'Green', 'novel', 'Philip', 'Stong', 'heartwarming', 'happy', 'look', 'America', 'heartland', 'good', 'past.Songs', 'Might', 'As', 'Well', 'Be', 'Spring', 'Grand', 'Night', 'Singing', 'are', 'easy', 'take', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'forced', 'never', 'get', ""'re"", 'going', 'sing', 'now', 'feel', 'numbers', 'are', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'help', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'Might', 'As', 'Well', 'Be', 'Spring', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'music', 'marvelous', 'so', 'film.Everyone', 'just', 'great', 'here', 'lovely', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'particular', 'standout', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'nice', 'bit', 'carny', 'Wayne', 'even', 'look', 'quick', 'Coleen', 'Grey', 'might', 'catch', 'Charles', 'Winninger', 'winning', 'are', 'Fay', 'Bainter', 'Dick', 'Haymes', 'Percy', 'Kilbride', 'was', 'always', 'amusing', 'was', 'one', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'best', 'roles', 'magnificent', 'Laura', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'nostalgic', 'feel', 'sitting', 'front', 'porch', 'middle', 'summer', 'glass', 'iced', 'tea', 'scent', 'honeysuckle', 'air', 'Virginia', 'Creepers', 'twisting', 'arbor', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'musicals', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss']",State Fair VHS

While  watching the madcap and romantic rural adventures of this good hearted, middle American family a couldn't help feeling as though I had been sucked through some sort of time warp to a time and place far more distant than a state fair in Iowa circa 1945. Was the world ever as simple, honest and wonderful as depicted here?Whether pure fantasy or real this film is definitely a nostalgic and wholesome viewing experience displaying the best of what ""Old Hollywood"" had to offer. The story line is a bit nave (or maybe we're just too jaded today) but enjoyable, the music fun and beautifully performed and the color exquisite. It also contains one of the amazing assemble casts filled with talented actors and actresses who's names you don't remember but you known you've seen and loved many times before.So enjoy your annual trip to the State Fair with Jeanne Crain, Dana Andrews and Dick Haymes and the rest of the lovable crew. Just be prepared for a little whiplash when the movies over and you return to the real world (sigh).",5,"""Our State Fair Is A Great State Fair"" ~ A Nostalgic Trip To Rural America",1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,1134,"['yesterday', 'had', ""n't"", 'viewed', ""'45"", 'musical', 'State', 'Fair', 'least', 'thirty', 'years', 'not', 'more', 'watching', 'madcap', 'romantic', 'rural', 'adventures', 'good', 'hearted', 'middle', 'American', 'family', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'had', 'been', 'sucked', 'sort', 'time', 'warp', 'time', 'place', 'far', 'more', 'distant', 'state', 'fair', 'Iowa', 'circa', '1945', 'Was', 'world', 'ever', 'as', 'simple', 'honest', 'wonderful', 'depicted', 'here', 'Whether', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'real', 'film', 'definitely', 'nostalgic', 'wholesome', 'viewing', 'experience', 'displaying', 'best', 'what', 'Old', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'offer', 'story', 'line', 'bit', 'nave', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'just', 'too', 'jaded', 'today', 'enjoyable', 'music', 'fun', 'beautifully', 'performed', 'color', 'exquisite', 'also', 'one', 'amazing', 'assemble', 'casts', 'filled', 'talented', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'names', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'known', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'loved', 'many', 'times', 'before.So', 'enjoy', 'annual', 'trip', 'State', 'Fair', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Dick', 'Haymes', 'rest', 'lovable', 'crew', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'little', 'whiplash', 'when', 'movies', 'return', 'real', 'world', 'sigh']",State Fair VHS
386839,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6303854311,Byron Kolln,"[51, 54]","This lovely new 60th Anniversary DVD edition of STATE FAIR is a must for all musical fans and Rodgers and Hammerstein II enthusiasts.  Featuring the duo's only score written exclusively for Hollywood, and based on the novel by Phil Stong (which had been previously filmed, very successfully, in 1933 with Janet Gaynor and Will Rogers), the musical STATE FAIR is full of homespun charm and lovely performances, enhanced by Technicolor photography and of course the accomplished R&H; score.During their annual visit to the Iowa State Fair, the Frake family enjoy many adventures.  Proud patriarch Abel (Charles Winninger) has high hopes for his champion swine Blueboy; and his wife Melissa (Fay Bainter) enters the mincemeat and pickles contest...with hilarious results.  Their children, however, have romance on their minds.  Wayne (Dick Haymes) falls head over heels for flashy bandstand singer Emily (Vivian Blaine), whilst Margy (Jeanne Crain) finds the man of her dreams in the worldly-wise journalist Pat (Dana Andrews).  Rodgers and Hammerstein's score features the beautiful Academy Award-winning song ""It Might as Well Be Spring"", not to mention a rich tunestack of ""That's for Me"", ""All I Owe Ioway"", ""Isn't It Kinda Fun?"" and ""It's a Grand Night for Singing"".The cast is simply superb.  Charles Winninger, who had been the original Capt'n Andy in Oscar Hammerstein II's ""Show Boat"", is a warm presence as the father, with Fay Bainter (Oscar-winner for ""Jezebel"") also heavily scoring as the wife.  Dick Haymes, with his clean-cut good looks and smooth crooning voice, is likewise a perfect fit for Wayne.  Vivian Blaine, in probably her best film appearance up to that time, is a postive delight as Emily, and with her flaming red hair and gorgeous gowns, we can understand completely why Wayne would fall so quickly under her spell!  Her film career all but ended with this movie but she later went on to find her greatest role as Miss Adelaide in the original Broadway production of ""Guys and Dolls"", later reprising her efforts for the film version.Just as the 1933 version was intended as a star vehicle for Janet Gaynor, so too was this 1945 version.  Jeanne Crain was the main starlet at Twentieth Century-Fox and the studio tailored this film as a showcase for her beauty and all-American wholesomeness.  But, Crain was not a singer, so her voice was dubbed by Louanne Hogan (who later made a career out of dubbing for Crain in other films like ""Margie"" and ""You Were Meant for Me"").The DVD looks fabulous and the original Technicolor negatives have been beautifully-restored for this new release.  Audio commentary is provided by film historian Richard Barrios and Tom Briggs who co-wrote the subsequent 1996 Broadway version of the musical.But the fun does not end there...This new DVD set also includes the seldom-seen or heard 1962 remake of STATE FAIR.  Since Oscar Hammerstein had by this point passed away, Richard Rodgers went back to the drawing-board and wrote several new songs for the score (""This Isn't Heaven"", ""Willing and Eager"", ""More Than Just a Friend"", ""Never Say 'No' to a Man"", ""The Little Things in Texas"") joining the classic numbers from the '45 version.Apart from the re-setting of the story to the annual Texas State Fair, the rest of the story plays out mostly in the same way including all the favourite storylines (the lovesick Blueboy and the spiking of Melissa's mincemeat).  But to keep in step with modern audiences, a few of the characters were slightly changed with Wayne (played by Pat Boone) now a race car driver.The performances here are also very fine.  Tom Ewell, as Abel, gives a wonderful gravity to the story and Alice Faye (returning to movies after a 30-year retirement) invests a lot of heart, sincerity and knowing comedy to the role of Melissa.  Young starlet Pamela Tiffin, as Margy, is the very picture of wide-eyed innocence and Pat Boone brings a lot of depth and earnestness to Wayne.  Ann-Margret (at the very apex of her sex-kitten phase) and Bobby Darin are likewise wonderful as the objects of affection for Wayne and Margy respectively.Filmed primarily on location, this STATE FAIR is a lot more expansive and cinematic than the 1945 version.  The musical numbers are very well-executed, the big highlight perhaps Ann-Margret's steamy rendition of ""Isn't It Kinda Fun?"" with a group of red velvet-clad beatnik male dancers.  Pat Boone's jubilant ""That's for Me"" and the aching ballad ""It Might as Well Be Spring"" (dubbed for Tiffin by voice double Anita Gordon) are also well-staged.  Of the new numbers, perhaps the best is ""This Isn't Heaven"", a perfect dreamy ballad for crooner Bobby Darin.  Pat Boone and Ann-Margret also make good with the pretty ""Willing and Eager"".  ""The Little Things in Texas"" could have turned into a throwaway number but Alice Faye and Tom Ewell hit the mark beautifully.The CinemaScope image has been cleaned up very well for the film's DVD debut.  Audio commentary is provided by Pat Boone who offers some cherished memories of working with his co-stars and director Jose Ferrer.Also featured on this 2-disc set is a documentary ""From Page to Screen to Stage"" charting the making of the various STATE FAIR's as well as the 1996 Broadway musical version; the pilot for the TV series starring Vera Miles and an excerpt from the 1954 Rodgers and Hammerstein/General Foods TV special, of Mary Martin performing ""It Might as Well Be Spring"".An amazing DVD package and highly-recommended.",5,impressive DVD package,1146268800,"04 29,

Family goes to the Iowa State Fair and each one has their own adventure.The 1962 remake has good actors -Pat Boone, Ann-Margaret and others.  However when the studio updated the story to 1962 and moved the setting to Texas, they lost much of what made the original so charming.  One example was the song and dance number that Ann-Margaret does.  Seemed like it should have been in a Las Vegas casino, not a state fair stage.It's because I didn't like the 2nd version that I rated this at 4 stars.

I've been waiting for the 1962 version for long time, and now it's coming out, but the only way I can get it is to purchse the 1945 version again. The 1962 version should also be available by itself.I won't say much about the 1945 version (Jeannie Crain/Dana Andrews) since there are already a lot of reviews for this movie. I will admit that the 1945 version is probably the best.The 1962 version (Ann-Marget, Pat Boone) is enjoyable, but for some reason isn't as entertaining as the 1945 version. However,it does have it's moments. One of them is the song/dance number that Ann-Margret does in the Fair Park Bandshell. This is one of the best song/dance numbers in the movies. Another great thing for me is the fact that the 1962 version was mostly filmed at Fair Park (the home of the Texas State Fair) in Dallas, Texas. The opening, and ending, are filmed at their farm (located somewhere), and the car race scene I've heard was filmed at the Oklahoma State Fairgrounds as Fair Park no longer had a racetrack (2 previous ones had been torn down). The rest of the movie was filmed at Fair Park, which has been in it's current location since 1886. I'm from the Dallas area, and it is nice seeing Fair Park as the setting of a movie.Also of interest in the 1962 version is that Alice Faye came out of a self-imposed retirement (during WWII) to do this film, and supposedly hated the experience. She was used to making movies in a studio, and by 1962 things had changed dramatically.The movie was made on location, in the Dallas summer heat. You can't tell that she was unhappy with the situation. In fact, her acting is probably the best in the movie. After all, she is, and always has been, a very good actress.To sum up, both movies are enjoyable to watch, if for different reasons.

The CinemaScope photography was just beautiful and was a vast improvement over the 1945 version. Director, Jos&eacute; Ferrer took full advantage of the fair grounds in Dallas where the Cotton Bowl is located. The Texas Hall of State building, an achievement of architectural Art Deco was prominently featured. Inside is the Great Hall and it has an Art Deco mural adorning both sides of its walls depicting the state's colorful history and these in turn are adorned by Texas' six flags: Spain, France, Mexico, Republic of Texas, The Confederate States and The United States. The 1945 version has a stronger cast but the 1962 version holds its own in more realistic fashion. There are many excellent stars in it including Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, Ann-Margret and Wally Cox. Alice Faye came out of retirement to play Pamela Tiffin's mother in a memorable performance. Walter Lang directed this 1945 version it too a remake from the 1933 version. Lang is a better director than Ferrer, but he doesn't have CinemaScope. All in all both films are strong on Americana and expound the virtues of man in harmony with his fellow man.

The movie follows the Frake family, an average farm family in Iowa, as they prepare to go to their state's big summer fair.  Melissa and Abel (Ma and Pa) want to win prizes; son Wayne wants to get even with a fair worker; and daughter Margy wants some excitement to happen in her otherwise mundane life.While at the fair, the whole family experiences the emotional highs and lows of anticipation, hoping for something, and (for the siblings) falling in love.State Fair stands out to me because the music is just gorgeous.  With classic ballads such as ""It Might as Well be Spring"" and the big band number ""That's For Me,"" there's no way you could forget the musical numbers in this production.Now, while I absolutely loved the 1945 version, I can't say the same for the 1962 version.  I had never seen it before buying this DVD, but I thought it lacked the beauty of the original movie.  The 1962 version focuses more on the Emily/Wayne relationship, and I wasn't too impressed with the added musical numbers.  Margy seemed rather bland, and her love interest (renamed Jerry, and now a TV reporter to modernize his role) struck me as sleazy and somewhat of a jurk.  I spent the whole movie wondering how she could ever like him.While I don't like the 1962 version at all, I do think it was a great idea for both versions to be packaged together for the Anniversary Edition.

This version is a Rodgers & Hammerstein production from 1945 and stars Jeanne Crain as Margy Frake and Dick Haymes as her brother Wayne Frake.  Both Margy and Wayne are hoping to find love at the fair, while parents Abel (Charles Winninger) and Melissa (Fay Bainter) are preoccupied with winning state fair contests.There are a number of pleasing musical numbers in the film including It Might As Well Be Spring, All I Owe Ioway, and It&#8217;s a Grand Night for Singing. There are some humorous moments in the film too, such as when Harry Morgan (Colonel Potter of MASH) shows up as a dishonest carnival worker, and Margy&#8217;s mom wins a recipe contest by inadvertently submitting a mince meat pie doubly spiked with liquor.Dana Andrews plays the city-wise news reporter who meets Margy and quickly becomes her new beau. Andrews acting was fine but he may have been a trifle old to play boyfriend to 20-ish Margy.

Each family member is going for a different purpose: the mom to win a pickle contest, the dad to win the hog contest, the eldest son to win the ring-toss (and get revenge on the swindler holding it) and the young daughter to get away from the farm and the only available bachelor in the county, for whom she has little interest. The daughter is the focus of the story as she goes from moping and being uninterested in the fair to finding the love (and having the time) of her life.For any romantics who have ever dreamt of having a fling or meeting the love of their life while on vacation, this story has an emotional irresistibility. Hopeless romantics watching alone will be hard-pressed to hold back tears and couples hard-pressed not to end up in each other's arms.The Rodgers and Hammerstein music is a real treat -- both delightful and catchy. You may find that you don't realize how good the music and lyrics are until you catch yourself humming or singing the songs days later.This is perhaps my favorite musical.

386864,A36A8KK9ZQBUV4,6303854311,Kardius,"[3, 5]","The original 1945 State Fair is downright corny, and there lies its charm, in that very corny, utopian 1940s vision of rural America.  The film also boasts a pleasant (some would say bland) quartet of leading stars (Jeanne Crain, Dana Andrews, Dick Haymes, Vivian Blaine), scene-stealing supporting players (reliable veterans Fay Bainter & Charles Winninger as the parents), and a fairly enjoyable score written for the screen by Rodgers and Hammerstein.  The stagey look and the intense Technicolor that characterized 1940s Fox musicals perfectly fits with the film's idealized image of rural America.  In short, the 1945 State Fair is a pleasant, if not particularly memorable, musical.The 1962 remake is simply mediocre.  The great Puerto Rican actor Jose Ferrer was clearly out of his element directing a movie musical.  (An Oscar-winner for ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" and a multiple Tony winning-actor and stage director, Ferrer never made it as a film director.) The idea to ""update"" the material was mistaken, especially the decision to give the story a more ""naturalistic"" look by filming outdoors.  In doing so, they took away all the charm of the original.  The new songs by Richard Rodgers are also mediocre.  The new cast is not much help.  Pamela Tiffin and Pat Boone are actually blander than Jeanne Crain and Dick Haymes.  Tiffin, in particular, doesn't make much of an impression as the female lead.  Bobby Darin and especially Ann-Margret are a lot more fun, but even though she brings some much-needed life to the movie, her contemporary sex appeal doesn't really fit with the film.  1940s Fox musical star Alice Faye (who would have probably been in the original if she hadn't walked out of the studio) came out of retirement to do this film, but she was reportedly unhappy through the shoot and didn't care for her co-star (Tom Ewell, apparently she wanted Don Ameche) and her disatisfaction shows on-screen.  Quite frankly, judging by Ewell's performance and the film's results, I can't blame her.  Still, its great that Fox released both films together.  I doubt that few people (other than die-hard fans of Boone, Darin, Faye, and Ann-Margret) would have cared to buy or rent the 1962 film otherwise.",4,Pleasant 1945 Original & Mediocre 1962 Remake,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,2217,"['original', '1945', 'State', 'Fair', 'downright', 'corny', 'there', 'charm', 'very', 'corny', 'utopian', '1940s', 'vision', 'rural', 'America', 'film', 'also', 'pleasant', 'would', 'say', 'bland', 'quartet', 'leading', 'stars', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Dick', 'Haymes', 'Vivian', 'Blaine', 'scene-stealing', 'supporting', 'players', 'reliable', 'veterans', 'Fay', 'Bainter', 'Charles', 'Winninger', 'parents', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'score', 'written', 'screen', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'stagey', 'look', 'intense', 'Technicolor', 'characterized', '1940s', 'Fox', 'musicals', 'perfectly', 'film', 'idealized', 'image', 'rural', 'America', 'short', '1945', 'State', 'Fair', 'pleasant', 'not', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'musical.The', '1962', 'remake', 'simply', 'mediocre', 'great', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'actor', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'was', 'clearly', 'element', 'directing', 'movie', 'musical', 'Oscar-winner', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'multiple', 'Tony', 'winning-actor', 'stage', 'director', 'Ferrer', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'director', 'idea', 'update', 'material', 'was', 'mistaken', 'especially', 'decision', 'give', 'story', 'more', 'naturalistic', 'look', 'filming', 'outdoors', 'doing', 'so', 'took', 'away', 'charm', 'original', 'new', 'songs', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'are', 'also', 'mediocre', 'new', 'cast', 'not', 'much', 'help', 'Pamela', 'Tiffin', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'are', 'actually', 'blander', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Dick', 'Haymes', 'Tiffin', 'particular', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'impression', 'female', 'lead', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'especially', 'Ann-Margret', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'even', 'much-needed', 'life', 'movie', 'contemporary', 'sex', 'appeal', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'film', '1940s', 'Fox', 'musical', 'star', 'Alice', 'Faye', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'original', 'had', ""n't"", 'walked', 'studio', 'came', 'retirement', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'reportedly', 'unhappy', 'shoot', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'co-star', 'Tom', 'Ewell', 'apparently', 'wanted', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'disatisfaction', 'on-screen', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'judging', 'Ewell', 'performance', 'film', 'results', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Still', 'great', 'Fox', 'released', 'films', 'together', 'doubt', 'few', 'people', 'other', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Boone', 'Darin', 'Faye', 'Ann-Margret', 'would', 'have', 'cared', 'buy', 'rent', '1962', 'film', 'otherwise']",State Fair VHS

386867,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6303854311,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 11]","Among the musicals that Richard Rodgers and Roger Oscar Hammerstein II worked on together State Fair might be the most anonymous.  It is also the only musical that these two legendary filmmakers and stage creators intentionally directed for the silver screen.  The film still contains the same positive attitude and upbeat performances that have been seen in Oklahoma! (1955) and South Pacific (1958).  Yet there is a significant difference between this musical and their later musical inventions, as the music in State Fair lacks the memorable spirit that the other musicals hold.  Nonetheless, State Fair managed to win an Oscar for best song for its It Might as Well Be Spring.The trademark in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals often display an overtly whimsical optimism, which also surfaces through every aspect of State Fair.  The blissful and pleasant music generates a fixed state of hopefulness with the performances by the cast enhance the extreme gleefulness in front of the camera.  The mise-en-scene delivers a strong studio setting presence, which accentuates mood of the artificial and wishful environment.  In modern time, it might feel out dated to the point of a sublimely dreamlike vision, but it is also within this quirky happiness that a wonderful musical journey emerges.  It should be approached like an aged wine.  Meaning, if improper method has been employed it might spoil the cinematic experience, which could result in a similar experience when observing poorly applied make-up.State Fair opens with the song Our State Fair while Dave Miller (Percy Kilbride), friend of the family, visits the Frake farm for business purposes.  The song functions like an introduction to the family and the way of life on an Iowan farm in the 1940s, and the social importance of the State Fair.  Shortly after the opening song, the audience gets to hear the Oscar winning song It Might as Well Be Spring sung by the daughter Margy (Jeanne Crain) who in mid August suffers by the excitement of the State Fair and the struggles of love.  Meanwhile, the mother Melissa (Fay Bainter) prepares her minced meat and pickles for the State Fair competition, as the father Abel (Charles Winninger) shows off his hopeful prize-winning hog Blue Boy to Dave.When Dave hears Abel's admiration for Blue Boy's sheer size and superiority, he shares his open pessimism with Abel by quoting his motto ""for every good, there is bad.""  It turns into a small argument between the two farmers that they eventually settle through a bet.  Abel suggests a five-dollar bet that nothing bad will happen to the Frake family at the State Fair, while Dave has a completely different idea.  It should be noted that many farmers have a true wisdom with reality, as they often see accidents and deaths through their farm animals and the dangers around a farm.  However, this is never shown in the film.In the barn the son Wayne, performed by vocal talent Dick Haymes, practices for one of the State Fair ring tossing games, as he intends to get back on the owner of the game.  Later, at the fair Wayne meets a red-haired beauty at the ring game whose presence strikes him with arrows of love.  Margy also meets the newspaperman Pat (Dana Andrews) that she becomes infatuated with while her worries about the future with the goody-goody boy Harry simply vanish.  The fair offers an opportunity for the whole Frake family to experience things they cannot achieve at home such as success, failures, and love.  Even the statement made by Dave rings true, as the audience will uncover that there is something good and bad in everything.  The only difference with Dave is that it is how you approach the situation, optimistically or pessimistically.  Thus, learn from Dave and do not bet on other people's misfortunes.State Fair brings out some worthwhile notions, laughter, and drama through a music and dance.  With a positive frame of mind, the audience will most likely enjoy this film a little more.  However, it is not one of those films with a tune that sticks in the mind, or that will allow the audience to remember the film some months later.  The songs could have been better, and the story a little less flimsy in its narrative.  Yet, this musical offers a cinematic experience worth seeing when time is not pressing.On the second disc the audience can uncover the remake of Stare Fair (1962), which is a rather disappointing experience compared to the film.  Here the story is set in the early 1960s and it feels a little silly compared to the 1945 version, yet it follows a similar path with its own adaptation incorporated.  However, this time the story is set in Texas instead of Iowa and most of the film seems to have been shot on location, which brings a more real touch to the story.  Despite the genuine approach, the 1962 version falls flat on its face compared to its musical predecessor.The 60th Anniversary Edition of State Fair is a gem for people worshiping musicals.  However, if the viewer desires a good narrative and fascinating intrigue then this DVD will only suffice for a viewing and not a purchase.  Out of the two films, the 1945 version of State Fair is far better, even though it feels more fictitious.  Thus, personally I can only recommend it for an evening rental when nothing else is available.",3,Rodgers and Hammerstein's Most Anonymous Musical...,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,5313,"['musicals',

386869,A2GPEV42IO41CI,6303854311,Kona,"[6, 7]","""State Fair"" is a sweet and charming musical from Rogers and Hammerstein.  As the story opens, the Frake family leaves their farm to go to the grand Iowa state fair.  Dad Abel is entering his prize hog in competition, Mother Melissa is hoping her mincemeat will win a prize, and kids Wayne and Margy are looking for love.  They both meet special someones at the fair, but what will happen when the fair closes?Jeanne Crain and Dick Haymes are just great as the naive siblings, full of clean-cut country charm.  They sing their way down the midway with tunes like, ""It Might as Well be Spring"" and ""It's a Grand Night for Singing.""  The lovely Vivian Blaine plays the sophisticated singer that catches Wayne's eye, and Dana Andrews is the reporter who sweeps Margy off her feet.  It's all as predictable as can be, and yet it's fun instead of sappy.  The stars are beautiful and talented, the songs hearken back to a gentler time, the technicolor is vibrant, and the old-fashioned fun of the summer fair is contagious.

386871,AD2BIAIH78QI5,6303854311,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[1, 7]","I rented ""State Fair"" this weekend to watch with my brother and his wife, and the idea that most often poppped into our heads was, ""This doesn't seem like a farmhouse family to me!"" I mean, when you consider how Aunt Em's farm looks in ""Wizard of Oz"", this family is surely living high on the hog! They've got a stunning kitchen and both children have brand-new extremely well-made wardrobes--part of our unintentionally cynical enjoyment was to comment on these kinds of details that make sure you know you're in the era when America was emerging as the top nation in the world, and the Great Depression was well behind.I thought the best performances were handed in by the older generation: the mom and pop were appealing and conveyed very nice people. Donald Meek was especially great as the pickled mincemeat judge who keeps following Ma through the fair. I had my difficulties with the romantic couples. I was just watching Dana Andrews again in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and he was reminding me of that character again here. It's a man who smiles with his lips only--it never extends to his eyes. A troubled man who is not really capable of being happy. I don't think Jeanne Crain (or Teresa Wright in the other film) would be doing a wise thing in marrying him because of this. I suppose it's also worth commenting on that Jeanne's parents haven't the foggiest clue that she's even met Dana Andrews, let alone is going to marry him at the end. They think she's going to marry her fiance who is rather unfairly characterized as a bore. He actually sounds like a fellow who's going to be very successful as a modern farmer, like a Bill Gates of the dairy world. His chief crime in un-romance seems to be that he wears glasses. If she would just be honest with him, maybe he could be as romantic as she'd like. Not very cricket to be engaged to a man you don't love, you know, and she already is at the outset.Then there's the son. He's got a girl he seems to be sweet on back home. She's a very lovely blonde, as we see during his telephone call. Then off he goes to the fair and takes up with the band singer, who isn't nearly as lovely as the girl he's already secured back home. He has no compunction, though, about pursuing the band singer; he totally dumps mentally the girl back home, whose only crime was that she couldn't come to the fair because a relative was sick. So how nice is he? Of course, Dick Haymes has a good voice, but otherwise he appeared to be miscast in this film; as one reviewer noted, he seemed to fit right in to the posh party thrown by the showbiz folks, and really he should be a fish out of water. My brother and sister-in-law  thought he had a strange-looking face, and then my brother concluded he was supposed to be a spin on then-popular Joe Di Maggio. He more reminded me of the pre-cortisone treatment JFK.So, ""State Fair"" does not rank that high on the Rodgers and Hammerstein geiger counter. It's not a bad score, though it's not the most memorable thing I'd ever heard. ""Grand Night for Singing"" (my personal favorite song) morphed in later years into ""Real Nice Clambake"" from ""Carousel""--listen to see if you agree with me. I thought Fox did a creditable job of a rip-off MGM musical. Better things were to come from R&H; in the next few years. ""State Fair""'s strongest point is that it's lovely to look at in its technicolor glory.

When I was younger I used to cringe at the prospect of having to watch a musical. My point of view began to change shortly after I got married at the age of 36.  My wife was a big fan of all the great musicals and so I somewhat reluctantly began to put my toe into the water. A couple of years later I had an epiphany and suddenly realized that many of these films are terrific after all.One of the first musicals I became enamored with was Rogers and Hammerstein's 1945 classic ""State Fair"". This was this only musical Rogers and Hammerstein ever wrote directly for the silver screen and it is a dandy. The film stars Jeanne Crain as Margie, a restless young lady who feels trapped by her rural surroundings and her dreadfully dull boyfriend and Dana Andrews as newspaper reporter Pat.  The two meet on the rollercoaster and fall head over heels for each other.  Meanwhile Margie's brother Wayne (Dick Haymes) is lamenting the fact that his girlfriend was unable to go to the fair with him this year. He is kind of moping around the midway when he has a rather bizarre encounter with a young lady who turns out to be the lead vocalist of the big band performing at the fair.  Wayne is smitten with Emily (Vivian Blaine) who kinda sorta leads him on throughout the film.  He'll be sorry!  The story line also follows the exploits of Margie and Wayne's parents (Charles Winnenger and Fay Bainter) who have both entered competitions at the fair.But as you might expect it is the marvelous music that makes ""State Fair"" such a joy to watch.  Dick Haymes was a huge recording star in the 1940's and is one of the greatest pop vocalists of all-time. You will certainly enjoy his splendid renditions of ""Isn't It Kinda Fun"", ""It's A Grand Night For Singing"" and of course ""It Might As Well Be String"" which became a huge hit record for him as well. Life was certainly much simpler in those days and hearing these wonderful tunes makes me long for them.  We enjoy this film 2 or 3 times each year and never get tired of it. There is one oddity about this film that is worth mentioning.  Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II won the Academy Award for Best song for Margie's rendition of ""It Might As Well Be Spring"".  But oddly enough Jeanne Crain's singing voice was dubbed by a singer named Louanne Hogan.  I believe this is the only time that this has ever happened in the history of the Academy Awards.Now I certainly can understand why some folks would look at ""State Fair"" and think it is kind of ""corny"".  And they would probably be right.  But damn it, I love it and I guess that's all that really matters.  My wife and I purchased the 60th Anniversary edition which features a whole host of extras including a copy of the 1962 remake of ""State Fair"" starring Pat Boone. In my view that version leaves a lot to be desired.  But if you have never seen the 1945 version of ""State Fair"" I urge you to give it a try.  You just might be surprised by how much you like it.

I bought the DVD for what I hoped would be an improvement over my VHS. I was disappointed by the audio and video quality of the DVD to be quite honest. The audio is so low that I really had to crank up my receiver to get an acceptable volume. Afterall, this is a musical isn't it? In the early part of the film when Jeanne Crain is singing ""It Might As Well Be Spring"", there seemed to be little gnats flying around her face. In reality they were spots on the film that SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP. This condition improved later on, but come on! These Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals should have been given a lot more loving care than they have received. I say this because other musicals in the series also have problems.

I have had the 1945 version on VHS for years and was always satisfied with it; the reason I bought this 2 disc DVD set was because it included the 1962 Cinemascope remake as well, which had been out of print for years.  The 1945 original is great--a classic--but the 1962 remake is my preferred version.  Maybe it is because the whole thing is opened up a lot more, thanks to the location filming, widescreen CinemaScope picture and stereophonic soundtrack.  Or maybe it is just because I'm a sucker for 1960s musicals.The video transfers are great.  The video transfer of the 1962 film is a vast improvement over my VHS dub I made when this film aired on FMC a few years ago.  The 1945 version is, of course, essential, but it's nice to have the 1962 version available in a beautiful restored print.  My only gripe about this package is that the glorious 1933 non-musical version was not included here where it could easily have been.

386889,A6FIAB28IS79,6303854311,Samuel Chell,"[1, 1]","I was annoyed recently to hear a Broadway performer, being interviewed on NPR, refer to Rodgers and Hammerstein as ""old-fashioned,"" conventional, rather ""square"" theater compared to the production he was involved with.  It merely illustrated the importance of knowing what you're talking about.  Hammerstein (""Show Boat"") and Rodgers (""Oklahoma"") were Broadway's greatest innovators, incapable of writing anything as obvious, artificial, and manipulative as so many of the  musicals of the past 30 years.""State Fair"" is no exception.  Paradoxically, it profits in part because of what it isn't: a Fred and Ginger, Gene Kelly, or big MGM production.  Each of the latter produces expectations which redound to the film's disfavor when they're not met.  ""State Fair,"" on the other hand, is a surprisingly fresh delight, always welcome for a repeat screening.  Granted, I continue to play out in my mind an alternative matching-up of the characters (Dick Haymes and Jeanne Crain simply look ""more right"" as a romantic couple than as brother and sister), but it's a small detail overmatched by the colorful photography and the overall conviviality of the production and the cast.Another minor disappointment is the delegation of the film's outstanding musical number--""It Might As Well Be Spring""--to the voice dubbing Jeanne Crain rather than to Dick Haymes, who has never sounded better--his rich voice strong and secure yet effortless and unforced, as ""natural"" as informal Iowa conversation, turning even the lesser musical numbers into compelling highlights.  It's unlikely that R&H; at the time could have guessed at the staying power of the song, equally attractive to instrumentalists and vocalists more than 60 years later (more recently, a Cheryl Bentyne version joins a Clifford Brown, Stan Getz, and 5-6 Sonny Stitt recordings of the tune in my collection).

Why is that? The French were always seeing them from a distance, whereas Ray's contemporary audience was familiar with so many tropes and cliches that they anitcipated them, and couldn't see clearly beyond what was obvious, nor discern anything but what they believed to be apparent. A similar misfortune eclipsed the 1962 version of State Fair, which was considered a stinker in its day. Because it was a vehicle to promote the musical careers of Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, and Ann Margret, few people saw beyond that; thinking they were being tricked, they refused to see it as anything but a gimmick. After almost fifty years, that cynicism has given way to either nostalgia, or an appreciation of history. The 1962 version of State Fair is American Graffiti uncontrived; as it happened, and not as Richard Dreyfuss remembered it.

Excellent movie by far and a good price.",5,State Fair Movie,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,341,"['always', 'been', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'movie/musicals', 'are', 'many', 'versions', 'movie', 'one', 'like', 'best', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'color', 'beautiful', 'are', 'songs', 'nice', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'sit', 'down', 'have', 'cup', 'tea', 'relax', 'Excellent', 'movie', 'far', 'good', 'price']",State Fair VHS

The movie even shows a little bit of harness racing which is a sport I'm very familiar with.  A good movie overall.,3,"""Sure, but whats more important it's termite proof.""",1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,178,"['Great', 'music', 'thin', 'plot', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'easy', 'eyes', 'movie', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'harness', 'racing', 'sport', ""'m"", 'very', 'familiar', 'good', 'movie', 'overall']",State Fair VHS
