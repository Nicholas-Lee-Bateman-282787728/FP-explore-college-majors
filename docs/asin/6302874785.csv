342569,APCUHWVKWROT4,6302874785,"Lost In Kansas ""James Corbett""","[0, 0]","As I look back on my youth, the more I love this movie. I am from Texas and I grew up going to drive ins like  The Skyway,The Trail, Palo Duro, and other super sleezy ones in my home town.  Drive ins were places where I grew up. Cold nights with on the post heaters that made more noise than heat, and driving off with the speaker still in the window.  Yes I even snuck into them in the trunk of cars and don't get me started about the ""back row.""Drive In the movie is a comedy, but to those of us from Texas rural towns, it is a documentary.  Yes, we talked like that.  As for the skating rink scene, yep dead on!  All the way to the pom poms on the skate.  The drive in concession stand was the place to meet and hook up with girls, if you were lucky.  For me I just got to look.This little seen jewel is what is called regional film making.  It was made to fit the middle America audience.  It was never ment for the urban audience.  A very good reason to see this movie is the movie showing at this drive in.  If you remember the old disaster movies then you will get a kick out this.  But a BIG plus is the music!  The music will bring a big o' smile to all the good ole boys and girls of Texas!The use of the songs is wild.  The scenes of the movie run right into a song that makes a comment on the scene.  The Texas town was like the small towns of West Texas.  To city slickers this a spoof because you never lived in these places.

342572,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6302874785,Only-A-Child,"[20, 23]","In the mid-1970's the Texas Film Commission provided considerable assistance to local filmmakers in an effort to grow the in-state film industry. One benefit of this was a little film appropriately titled ""Drive-In""; a feature about drive-in movies meant to be shown at drive-ins. Although set in a small town outside Dallas, it could be Anywhere, USA; or at least any place where teen entertainment is centered around a town's roller skating rink and the drive-in theater.If ""Drive-In"" was nothing more than a loving look at drive-ins and a time-capsule of the mid-70's it would be a treat, but this film is actually very well made. I originally saw it at a drive in Orange County, CA a few months after moving there from Texas. Although most of America's drive-ins have vanished, the entertainment aspect of this film has held up very well.Don't go looking for a lot of familiar faces in the cast, part of the film commission's mission was to utilize local talent so you will see a lot of Texas folks getting their first and last screen credits. You might recognize Engelberg (Gary Cavagnaro), the fat catcher from ""The Bad News Bears""; and character actor Glenn Morshower but the rest of the cast are folks like Michelle Franks, a local beauty who just acts natural.The main story involves the efforts of the town's hottest girl (Glowie played by Lisa LeMole) to convince nice but very shy Orville (Morshower) that she is sincerely interested in him. But the film is loaded with side stories that weave into and around the main story. These include two wimpy teen gangs, The Widow Makers and The Gear Grinders who have a mild fight witnessed by a couple of outlaw bikers who comment: ""Gang violence, its frightening"". There are a couple of bumbling small time thieves who attempt to rob the theater box office. There is an auxiliary sheriff with gun rack and right-wing bumper stickers who shuts up his nagging mother by smoking a joint with her. There is an engaged couple having second thoughts about getting married, especially after the guy gets a look at Michelle Franks at the concession stand.Much of the humor comes from ""Disaster 76"", a movie within the movie. It is being screened at the drive-in and there are frequent cuts to the action on that screen. It is a nice spoof of a whole group of disaster flicks including ""Airport"", ""Jaws"", and ""The Towering Inferno"". Current viewers will be shocked when a 747 crashes into the side of a skyscraper in a manner almost identical to the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. Obviously this idea has been around for a long time although apparently no one in the FBI ever viewed ""Drive-In"", wonder if it got any play in the Middle East?There is also a television show within the movie as The Widow Makers spend their downtime watching ""Ozzie and Harriet"" reruns on the television set in their van.At one point Engleberg refers to Oklahoma as Baja Arkansas and says ""reasoning with a woman is like eating soup with a fork"". Glowie turns down the offer of a ride home from a guy hitting on her with the immortal line: ""I'd rather have a nonspecific infection"".Fans of classic country music will love the soundtrack featuring Loretta Lynn, Conway Twitty, Ronnie Milsap, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, and Jerry Lee Lewis. ""Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?"" by The Statler Brothers is the theme song.Then again, what do I know?

342574,A1UIOMPBKE4FZW,6302874785,Randy Smith,"[1, 2]","This just came out on DVD.  I was 16 when it came out, and one of the first movies I  ever saw in the drive in after I had my license and could drive in myself.  I saw it a number of times at the drive in.  A great slice of the 70's.  This was my teenage years.  Roller rink, drive in, hanging out.  In the 70's We didnt have computers, Cell phones, Facebook.  This is what we teens did in the 70's.  It's the story of a shy boy named Orley who goes to the drive in with his little brother and hooks up with the girl friend of the local bully.  That afternoon,  before they go to the drive in theater, the two brothers  go to the local roller rink.  There is plenty of charecter development here, as we see Orley  and his little brother  meet up with many of the others people in the film , indulding the bully and his gang. This is also where the girl first  tells  Orley  that she likes him.  The roller rink is just like the one I went to as a teen.  This movie is a little slow paced but that is because it takes it's time developing the relationship between the two brother and the relationship between Orley and the girl.  There  are also two bumbeling would be robbers who want to steal  the cash box from the drive in.  Naturally everything they  do is wrong.  One of the best parts of the movie is the movie with in a movie.  The film the drive in is showing is Disaster 76.  Well, if you grew up in the 70's like me, you know we saw all of them.  All the Airport films,  Earthquake, Jaws, Towering Inferno.  All of them are satarized here.  The film on the screen is just as funny as the reg film and  it is a  hysterical send up of diseaster film.  Nearly as funny as Airplane.  In fact I bet the  Zucker brothers saw this and got their idea from it.  This film has no stars.  I do not remember ever seeing anyone in this film in anything  else.  Though Glen Morshower, the actor who plays Orley, did go on to do much on TV and in the movies.  He can be seen in many episodes of Star Trek and the TV show 24.  They all look like normal reg people, not plastic hollywood types.  This adds to the film.  It has a very regional feel / look to it.  Rod Amateu directed this.  He also direted most of the TV show ""Dobbie  Gillis""  and ""Our Miss Brooks.""  It's easy to see that he took his time with the actors to get them to be likable.  This film has no blood.  No nudity.  Not much swearing and just a little violence, fighting.  You know the hero has to fight the bully in the end.
