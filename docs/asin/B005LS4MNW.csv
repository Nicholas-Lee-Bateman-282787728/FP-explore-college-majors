This is a superbly acted, gumshoe-like mystery with fantastic comedic twists.  We know we are going to watch it again because there will be things we missed.

1493621,ARI0VCGRLXIZF,B005LS4MNW,mmareptile,"[0, 0]","I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie not saying others might not like it. It just wasnt that type of dark comedie I get into personally. I bought this film for 2 reasons really.1. The 3D. I'm a big 3D nut and if you look at some of my other  reviews you will probably be able to tell that and you would also notice I will try to find some thing positive in most 3D movies but this one is very flat. I had better effects playing it in 2D and using my 3DTV to convert it for me. Yeah the 3D was that bad. I'm pretty sure this is one of these movies like loser,2:22,the job and others where they are over seas movie with very little to no effort and making it a 3D movie.If you are looking to add to your 3d collection you will be disappointed i'm afraid.2. Was for the actors, I mean you got the Dink man from game of thrones, Tim Roth from reservoir dogs and steve bushem( i am not even gonna pretend i can spell his last name..hahaha) But the main guy from Board walk empire(which is an awesome show if you have a chance) Any way I'm not going to get into the story cause I'm sure you have read up on the movie already. The acting wasnt bad by any means it was just a story I couldn't really get into and I wanted too. Like I said it wasnt a bad movie just not my type. I would give the movie 3 stars maybe but due to the fact they slapped a 3D label on this (and you will feel robbed if you buy this movie for it's 3d) I cant give it more than 2 stars over all. I figured 3 stars for the movie, 1 star for the 3d.I hope this helps others in there purchase.",2,Okay movie and there really is no 3D,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,1558,"['was', ""n't"", 'biggest', 'fan', 'movie', 'not', 'saying', 'others', 'might', 'not', 'just', 'wasnt', 'type', 'dark', 'comedie', 'get', 'personally', 'bought', 'film', '2', 'reasons', 'really.1', '3D', ""'m"", 'big', '3D', 'nut', 'look', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'would', 'also', 'notice', 'will', 'try', 'find', 'thing', 'positive', 'most', '3D', 'movies', 'one', 'very', 'flat', 'had', 'better', 'effects', 'playing', '2D', 'using', '3DTV', 'convert', 'Yeah', '3D', 'was', 'bad', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'one', 'movies', 'loser,2:22', 'job', 'others', 'where', 'are', 'seas', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'effort', 'making', '3D', 'movie.If', 'are', 'looking', 'add', '3d', 'collection', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'i', ""'m"", 'afraid.2', 'Was', 'actors', 'mean', 'got', 'Dink', 'man', 'game', 'thrones', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'reservoir', 'dogs', 'steve', 'bushem', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'gon', 'pretend', 'i', 'can', 'spell', 'last', 'name..hahaha', 'main', 'guy', 'Board', 'walk', 'empire', 'awesome', 'show', 'have', 'chance', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'story', 'cause', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'read', 'up', 'movie', 'already', 'acting', 'wasnt', 'bad', 'means', 'was', 'just', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'wanted', 'too', 'said', 'wasnt', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'type', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'maybe', 'due', 'fact', 'slapped', '3D', 'label', 'will', 'feel', 'robbed', 'buy', 'movie', '3d', 'cant', 'give', 'more', '2', 'stars', 'figured', '3', 'stars', 'movie', '1', 'star', '3d.I', 'hope', 'others', 'purchase']",Pete Smalls Is Dead
