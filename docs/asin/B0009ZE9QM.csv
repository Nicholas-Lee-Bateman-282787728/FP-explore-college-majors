917191,A29YRP7D3559RT,B0009ZE9QM,"AJR ""cynical""","[3, 4]","Chobits is a charming anime series, portraying a world like our own, with a single difference: their personal computers are called persocoms, and are shaped like people, not boring beige boxes. The series tells the story of a young man from the country coming to the big city, and explores his encounters with a persocom in the form of a pretty young woman (you can see her on the cover).I bought the DVDs one-by-one as they were released, suffering the agony of waiting for the next one to be released. It's good to be able to get all of the episodes in one set. The Bluray transfer is not a fresh transfer from the source material; I understand this is an upscale of the DVD transfer, but it is a very good one (I thought it was a native high def transfer at first).Instead of 6 DVDs we get 3 Blurays, which means far fewer disc changes, but they have kept all the extras, so you don't miss out on anything despite only getting half the number of discs.Best of all, this set is region-free, so it doesn't matter what region your player is - you can play this.",4,"A good transfer, especially for an upscale",1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,1061,"['Chobits', 'charming', 'anime', 'series', 'portraying', 'world', 'own', 'single', 'difference', 'personal', 'computers', 'are', 'called', 'persocoms', 'are', 'shaped', 'people', 'not', 'boring', 'beige', 'boxes', 'series', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'country', 'coming', 'big', 'city', 'encounters', 'persocom', 'form', 'pretty', 'young', 'woman', 'can', 'see', 'cover', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'one-by-one', 'were', 'released', 'suffering', 'agony', 'waiting', 'next', 'one', 'be', 'released', 'good', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'episodes', 'one', 'set', 'Bluray', 'transfer', 'not', 'fresh', 'transfer', 'source', 'material', 'understand', 'upscale', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'native', 'high', 'def', 'transfer', 'first', '.Instead', '6', 'DVDs', 'get', '3', 'Blurays', 'far', 'fewer', 'disc', 'changes', 'have', 'kept', 'extras', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'anything', 'only', 'getting', 'number', 'discs.Best', 'set', 'region-free', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'region', 'player', 'can', 'play']",Chobits - The Chobits Collection
917192,A130YN8T37O833,B0009ZE9QM,"Always Samsung ""ravereviews""","[9, 17]","This is a really good show that any anime fan or cartoon lover will enjoy. The show starts off light and fluffy, but underneath the exterior or by the end of the first episode, fans will realize that something dark and sinister is brewing behind the scenes. The story centers around Hideki who is your average Joe and desperately wants a Persocom (A life size version of a Palm Pilot, PDA, Smartphone - whatever one wants to call it). This show was made before the iPhone & Android era, so he basically wants a PDA that he can't afford. PDA's on this show are known as Persocom's and are life size robotic computers that function like human beings with the ability to talk, run errands, etc. (No Wi-Fi included hahaha) These PDAs still use plugs and wires. The Persocoms come in many different forms, tall, short, long hair, blonde, etc. Hideki stumbles upon one in his garbage can one night and decides to take it home with him. However, his Persocom has completely no memory whatsoever. He immediately notices that she is completely different from the rest, but decides to keep her anyways. While other Persocoms operate and act like normal human beings, his is devoid of any emotion. The only thing she recalls is this recurring dream she can't escape from that holds a key to her past. Things start to unravel and the shows light-hearted tone takes a complete turn for the worst that most people probably expected. The shows pace is a bit on the slow side at first. I guess this is due in part that the intention was to show the relationship between Hideki and Chi (His Persocom) as it gradually builds. If one hangs in there, they will surely be rewarded. This show perhaps would have been stellar if it was thirteen episodes, but it ends up being twenty-something episodes. This was originally released by Geneon entertainment. The company has now officially gone out of business, but Funimation has picked up a few of their titles and has been rereleasing them. Most likely there won't be many extras. I have picked up a few Geneon titles rereleased by Funimation and most of them are just the show with no extras. Pick this up if you love anime by CLAMP and the price is very reasonable compared to what it was during its original release.",5,Smartphones without the Wi-Fi,1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,2247,"['really', 'good', 'show', 'anime', 'fan', 'cartoon', 'lover', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'light', 'fluffy', 'exterior', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'fans', 'will', 'realize', 'something', 'dark', 'sinister', 'brewing', 'scenes', 'story', 'centers', 'Hideki', 'who', 'average', 'Joe', 'desperately', 'Persocom', 'A', 'life', 'size', 'version', 'Palm', 'Pilot', 'PDA', 'Smartphone', 'one', 'call', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'iPhone', 'Android', 'era', 'basically', 'PDA', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'PDA', 'show', 'are', 'known', 'Persocom', 'are', 'life', 'size', 'robotic', 'computers', 'function', 'human', 'beings', 'ability', 'talk', 'run', 'errands', 'etc', 'Wi-Fi', 'included', 'hahaha', 'PDAs', 'still', 'use', 'plugs', 'wires', 'Persocoms', 'come', 'many', 'different', 'forms', 'tall', 'short', 'long', 'hair', 'blonde', 'etc', 'Hideki', 'one', 'garbage', 'can', 'one', 'night', 'take', 'home', 'However', 'Persocom', 'completely', 'memory', 'whatsoever', 'immediately', 'completely', 'different', 'rest', 'keep', 'anyways', 'other', 'Persocoms', 'operate', 'act', 'normal', 'human', 'beings', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'only', 'thing', 'recurring', 'dream', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'key', 'past', 'Things', 'start', 'unravel', 'shows', 'light-hearted', 'tone', 'complete', 'turn', 'worst', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'expected', 'shows', 'pace', 'bit', 'slow', 'side', 'first', 'guess', 'due', 'part', 'intention', 'was', 'show', 'relationship', 'Hideki', 'Chi', 'Persocom', 'gradually', 'one', 'hangs', 'there', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'rewarded', 'show', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stellar', 'was', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'up', 'being', 'twenty-something', 'episodes', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'Geneon', 'entertainment', 'company', 'now', 'officially', 'gone', 'business', 'Funimation', 'picked', 'up', 'few', 'titles', 'been', 'rereleasing', 'Most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'many', 'extras', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'few', 'Geneon', 'titles', 'rereleased', 'Funimation', 'most', 'are', 'just', 'show', 'extras', 'Pick', 'up', 'love', 'anime', 'CLAMP', 'price', 'very', 'reasonable', 'compared', 'what', 'was', 'original', 'release']",Chobits - The Chobits Collection
917193,AOB5695UUUJ0,B0009ZE9QM,"Anime Lover ""D""","[14, 22]","i actually have all 6 original disk to this series and when i see that they plan to release it again, i may have to consider.  this was one of my first series i collected when i really got into anime (along with Fushigi Yugi, and Full Metal Panic!)the story is about an alternate world where computers and robots are combined into a single entity, the PERSOCOM.  these devices come in all shapes and sized, but the most popular are the human sized models.  they can not only check your email, but cook and do other personal things as well.  our main character Heidiki, is a farm boy going to the big city to go to cram school so he can get into college and off the farm so he does has never seen a PERSOCOM before.  on his first night in the city, he comes across a cute blonde m,odel in the trash, so he decides to take it home (after all it would be recycling).  when he finally finds the on switch (the whole process is hilarious), not only does she turn on, but she does not seem to have any memory and can only say ""Chi"", which becomes her name. his neighbor and new friend, an avid techie, trys to help him but Chi seem to be to powerful for his mobile model Sumommo to access.  This starts the path of the story, and a dire warning from another PERSOCOM maker, ""just because she looks human, don't fall in love with her""the story starts out light and funny, but along the way it does get darker, and more serious, as Heidiki and Chi work to not only discover why Chi was created, but also his own feelings towards her.  And Chi also has to work out why a series of books called ""The Town with no People"" affects her.  It shows a darker side, not only on human nature, but of technology as well, so be prepared to go down the rabbit hole with this one.but the series is great for anyone who likes a good romance, with a moral to it.  Watch it and enjoy as Heidiki and Chi try to discover the ""One For Me"".",5,old school anime - but one of the best i own,1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,1911,"['i', 'actually', 'have', '6', 'original', 'disk', 'series', 'when', 'i', 'see', 'plan', 'release', 'again', 'i', 'may', 'have', 'consider', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'series', 'i', 'collected', 'when', 'i', 'really', 'got', 'anime', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'story', 'alternate', 'world', 'where', 'computers', 'robots', 'are', 'combined', 'single', 'entity', 'PERSOCOM', 'devices', 'come', 'shapes', 'sized', 'most', 'popular', 'are', 'human', 'sized', 'models', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'check', 'email', 'cook', 'do', 'other', 'personal', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'character', 'Heidiki', 'farm', 'boy', 'going', 'big', 'city', 'go', 'cram', 'school', 'can', 'get', 'college', 'farm', 'so', 'never', 'seen', 'PERSOCOM', 'first', 'night', 'city', 'cute', 'blonde', 'm', 'odel', 'trash', 'take', 'home', 'would', 'be', 'recycling', 'when', 'finally', 'switch', 'whole', 'process', 'hilarious', 'not', 'only', 'turn', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'memory', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'Chi', 'name', 'neighbor', 'new', 'friend', 'avid', 'techie', 'trys', 'help', 'Chi', 'seem', 'be', 'powerful', 'mobile', 'model', 'Sumommo', 'access', 'path', 'story', 'dire', 'warning', 'PERSOCOM', 'maker', 'just', 'human', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'love', 'story', 'out', 'light', 'funny', 'way', 'get', 'darker', 'more', 'serious', 'Heidiki', 'Chi', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'discover', 'why', 'Chi', 'was', 'created', 'also', 'own', 'feelings', 'Chi', 'also', 'work', 'out', 'why', 'series', 'books', 'called', 'Town', 'People', 'darker', 'side', 'not', 'only', 'human', 'nature', 'technology', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'go', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'series', 'great', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'romance', 'moral', 'Watch', 'enjoy', 'Heidiki', 'Chi', 'try', 'discover', 'One', 'Me']",Chobits - The Chobits Collection
917194,AD9ZGZILKGZYI,B0009ZE9QM,Archmage Ryokosha,"[5, 5]","This is an excellent anime, and a very nice take on the more traditional ""boy meets girl plots"". Some have said in the past that this series is yet another one about a lonely guy often a nerdy type, who is lucky enough to meet a lovely, and (not always) submissive female. In most anime, this female robot or android just happens to be a robot or android of some sort either created by or stumbled upon by the main character. However, that is far too simple a way to explain it and I think unjustly labels ""Chi"", the Persocom (android) within this story, and the other female androids.Looking only at ""Chi"" as the story moves on it is obvious she is not submissive but filled with childlike innocence. This is what helps make the story so different from others with female androids. Chi is truly a child learning about the world around her and the very important rule it will seem she will play seemingly as one of the legendary ""Chobits"", the Peroscoms that legend holds are have real emotions and need no traditional programming to function.As she learns about this world around her, and at times has her innocence exploited, something that can easily be mistaken for her being submissive, Hideki, the main male character and one that finds Chi, finds himself both as her teacher and her caretaker. As they both grown and learn together and begin to see the world through each other's eyes they naturally grow closer together in a way that works as being very easy to accept and believe could happen.The climax itself and what happens when all the pieces are in place, the pieces of the puzzles that build through mysterious photos, and searches to see if Chi really is a ""Chobits"" is something not to be missed and is one of the most stunning and emotionally filled endings I have ever seen to an anime.With a story that is so well written that it is very easy to grow to love the characters and feel excitement about the characters this ending was perhaps even more emotional. Overall this is not an anime you should miss and is one that should be on  everyone's ""Must See"" lists no matter your typical favorite genre.",5,One of CLAMP's Best,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,2122,"['excellent', 'anime', 'very', 'nice', 'take', 'more', 'traditional', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'plots', 'have', 'said', 'past', 'series', 'yet', 'one', 'lonely', 'guy', 'often', 'nerdy', 'type', 'who', 'lucky', 'enough', 'meet', 'lovely', 'not', 'always', 'submissive', 'female', 'most', 'anime', 'female', 'robot', 'android', 'just', 'be', 'robot', 'android', 'sort', 'either', 'created', 'stumbled', 'main', 'character', 'However', 'far', 'too', 'simple', 'way', 'explain', 'think', 'unjustly', 'Chi', 'Persocom', 'android', 'story', 'other', 'female', 'androids.Looking', 'only', 'Chi', 'story', 'moves', 'obvious', 'not', 'submissive', 'filled', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'what', 'make', 'story', 'so', 'different', 'others', 'female', 'androids', 'Chi', 'truly', 'child', 'learning', 'world', 'very', 'important', 'rule', 'will', 'seem', 'will', 'play', 'seemingly', 'one', 'legendary', 'Chobits', 'Peroscoms', 'legend', 'are', 'have', 'real', 'emotions', 'need', 'traditional', 'programming', 'function.As', 'world', 'times', 'innocence', 'exploited', 'something', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'mistaken', 'being', 'submissive', 'Hideki', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'one', 'Chi', 'teacher', 'caretaker', 'grown', 'learn', 'together', 'begin', 'see', 'world', 'other', 'eyes', 'naturally', 'grow', 'closer', 'together', 'way', 'being', 'very', 'easy', 'accept', 'believe', 'could', 'happen.The', 'climax', 'what', 'when', 'pieces', 'are', 'place', 'pieces', 'puzzles', 'build', 'mysterious', 'photos', 'searches', 'see', 'Chi', 'really', 'Chobits', 'something', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'one', 'most', 'stunning', 'emotionally', 'filled', 'endings', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'anime.With', 'story', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'easy', 'grow', 'love', 'characters', 'feel', 'excitement', 'characters', 'ending', 'was', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'emotional', 'Overall', 'not', 'anime', 'should', 'miss', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'everyone', 'Must', 'See', 'matter', 'typical', 'favorite', 'genre']",Chobits - The Chobits Collection

917197,A27BN7M1N93SIE,B0009ZE9QM,bozeman1941,"[1, 1]","I just finished watching this series, and I totally loved it! It is poignant, innocent, funny at times (in an awkward sort of way!), has a lot of depth to the characters, a few sad moments, and is really lovable.The story is based on male lead Hideki Motosuwa, an 18-year-old student who has been sent to Tokyo by his parents to study at a 'cram' school (he lives on a farm with his family normally). He has an unfortunate tendency to 'think' out loud (a habit he got into when working alone on his parents' farm), which causes him some embarrassing moments! Shortly after arriving, he finds a 'persocom' (a human form computer/android) in the trash, and takes her home and tries to restart her. After eventually managing to do so, he finds she has no data installed, and is only able to say one word, 'Chi', so he names her Chi. She turns out subsequently to be a 'Chobit' series persocom (hence the title) which are much more sophisticated than the run-of-the-mill persocoms, and rumoured to be sentient (i.e. self-aware). His next-door neighbour, fellow-student Hiromu Shinbo and his persocom (a cute, doll-sized, mobile model called Sumomo) helped him to get Chi going again. Other characters are Chitose Hibiya, the manager/landlady of the apartment block where Hideki and Shinbo live, who is kind, gentle and helpful, even letting Hideki pay his rent late when he loses his wallet one time. She teaches Chi to make curry and rice for Hideki's evening meal. Then there is Minoru Kokubunji, a 12-year-old genius, expert on persocoms and son of a rich family; he owns a number of persocoms, all of whom are dressed in skimpy, maid-type outfits complete with stockings and suspenders! He also has one special, custom-built persocom called Yuzuki, who looks and sounds like his late sister, whom he misses very much; she is wiser and kinder than most of the 'standard' persocoms, and seems to really care about Minoru, whom she addresses as 'Lord Minoru'. Attractive Miss Takako Shimizu is Hideki and Shinbo's teacher, and often catches Hideki daydreaming in class. When Hideki is forced to take a part-time job at a pub/restaurant called 'My Pleasure', in order to make ends meet, he meets bosses daughter Yumi Omura, a cute 17-year-old who is petite and pretty, and has ample bosoms ('I'm a D cup, if you're wondering', she tells Hideki one time, when he absent-mindedly stares at her chest)! Hiroyasu Ueda is a kind, gentle guy, manager of a cake shop, where Chi gets a part-time job. He is impressed with Chi's ability to learn on the job, and to work hard, and becomes friends with both Chi and Hideki - he even teaches Chi to make cakes herself. He has a sad secret in his past. Yoshiyuki Kojima, aka 'Dragonfly', is a somewhat obsessive, slightly creepy, custom persocom builder who becomes obsessed with Chi, and even kidnaps her at one point. He has a cute mobile persocom called Kotoko, who is kind and wise, and programmed to always tell the truth, which lands her master in trouble at times! She and Sumomo are often seen together towards the end of the series, although Kotoko finds Sumomo to be loud, unsubtle and a bit hard to take, often sighing in exasperation at her crazy antics! Lastly there are Zima and Dita, two security persocoms, who have been tasked with keeping tabs on Chi, in case she runs her 'final program', with unknown disastrous consequences.There is little in the way of fanservice (apart from one episode where Hideki has to buy underwear for Chi!), and Kokobunji's 'maid' persocoms.

917199,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B0009ZE9QM,Christopher Engel,"[5, 7]","There's been plenty already said about Chobits and its anime adaptation, but the real problem here is that this Blu-ray release is completely riddled with very serious problems that border the line of unwatchable; they're so bad, in fact, that the DVD release actually does seem to inexplicably look and sound better.Little to no effort was done here to translate this into Blu-ray, and it appears to have done only bad things to it. There is literally no improvement in any area. The picture quality is the worst I've seen for an anime, bar none. Jagged edges are absolutely everywhere, the animation stutters so often it can happen very noticeably several times an episode, some frames are so ugly it's as if you're streaming them from a standard cell phone in 320x240 resolution back in the 3gp era, the colors are all horribly washed out and there is an unbelievable lack of vibrancy, practically all of the animation is blurred to some extent, and, to put it short, this is actually worse than any typical DVD release, including its own.The sound, despite being advertised as improved, does not seem noticeably improved at all. Errors in synchronization are rampant, the quality sounds as if it's been ultracompressed into nothingness, there was clearly no effort whatsoever in the remixing and it's immediately noticeable, and the voices all sound as muted as if you're playing a standard-quality YouTube video off of a laptop. It's simply awful, and impossible not to be distracted by.There are no redeeming features here to speak of. The menus are ugly and confusingly laid out, the extras are extraneous even by anime standards, and while I prefer dub over sub, upon looking at the text, the complaints are completely justified. All voice subtitles are white with a thin black border, but the text, for some impossible reason, is so incredibly jagged that I've had easier times reading subtitles on a low-band stream of untouched anime from 20 years ago. It's comparable to a VHS tape in quality. For me, this really isn't an issue, since I watch dubs anyway, but anyone who enjoys subs more are going to have a really, really hard time accepting this level of unreadability here on televisions and monitors smaller than thirty inches.Considering that FUNimation has done excellent work with some of their Blu-ray releases, the neglect of care done for this series is shameful, even if you factor in the age of the series. With simply horrid video, audio, and text quality that is somehow worse than the DVD releases, there is no reason for this to even exist. Nothing I've said is an exaggeration; it really does look and sound that bad. It's a miserable transition into Blu-ray, seemingly done in one quick run with no care taken whatsoever to make sure it simply worked right.It's safe to assume that, someday, somewhere, CLAMP's penultimate work, Card Captor Sakura, will be translated to Blu-ray, too. All I can do is wait and hope that a little more work is put into that so it's actually worth it after such a long wait, with no beginning in sight for any project of the sort. We might end up with a totally different format by the time that happens, the way things are going now.Worthless and insulting.",1,"A classic CLAMP series, but not at all worth the Blu-ray it's on",1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,3220,"['been', 'plenty', 'already', 'said', 'Chobits', 'anime', 'adaptation', 'real', 'problem', 'here', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'completely', 'riddled', 'very', 'serious', 'problems', 'border', 'line', 'unwatchable', ""'re"", 'so', 'bad', 'fact', 'DVD', 'release', 'actually', 'seem', 'inexplicably', 'look', 'sound', 'better.Little', 'effort', 'was', 'done', 'here', 'translate', 'Blu-ray', 'have', 'done', 'only', 'bad', 'things', 'literally', 'improvement', 'area', 'picture', 'quality', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anime', 'bar', 'none', 'Jagged', 'edges', 'are', 'absolutely', 'everywhere', 'animation', 'stutters', 'so', 'often', 'can', 'happen', 'very', 'noticeably', 'several', 'times', 'episode', 'frames', 'are', 'so', 'ugly', ""'re"", 'streaming', 'standard', 'cell', 'phone', '320x240', 'resolution', 'back', '3gp', 'era', 'colors', 'are', 'horribly', 'washed', 'out', 'unbelievable', 'lack', 'vibrancy', 'practically', 'animation', 'blurred', 'extent', 'put', 'short', 'actually', 'worse', 'typical', 'DVD', 'release', 'including', 'own.The', 'sound', 'being', 'advertised', 'improved', 'not', 'seem', 'noticeably', 'improved', 'Errors', 'synchronization', 'are', 'rampant', 'quality', 'been', 'ultracompressed', 'nothingness', 'was', 'clearly', 'effort', 'whatsoever', 'remixing', 'immediately', 'noticeable', 'voices', 'sound', 'as', 'muted', ""'re"", 'playing', 'standard-quality', 'YouTube', 'video', 'laptop', 'simply', 'awful', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'distracted', 'are', 'redeeming', 'here', 'speak', 'menus', 'are', 'ugly', 'confusingly', 'laid', 'out', 'extras', 'are', 'extraneous', 'even', 'anime', 'standards', 'prefer', 'dub', 'sub', 'looking', 'text', 'complaints', 'are', 'completely', 'justified', 'voice', 'subtitles', 'are', 'white', 'thin', 'black', 'border', 'text', 'impossible', 'reason', 'so', 'incredibly', 'jagged', ""'ve"", 'had', 'easier', 'times', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'low-band', 'stream', 'untouched', 'anime', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'comparable', 'VHS', 'tape', 'quality', 'really', ""n't"", 'issue', 'watch', 'dubs', 'anyway', 'anyone', 'who', 'subs', 'more', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'really', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'accepting', 'level', 'unreadability', 'here', 'televisions', 'monitors', 'smaller', 'thirty', 'inches.Considering', 'FUNimation', 'done', 'excellent', 'work', 'Blu-ray', 'releases', 'neglect', 'care', 'done', 'series', 'shameful', 'even', 'factor', 'age', 'series', 'simply', 'horrid', 'video', 'audio', 'text', 'quality', 'somehow', 'worse', 'DVD', 'releases', 'reason', 'even', 'exist', 'Nothing', ""'ve"", 'said', 'exaggeration', 'really', 'look', 'sound', 'bad', 'miserable', 'transition', 'Blu-ray', 'seemingly', 'done', 'one', 'quick', 'run', 'care', 'taken', 'whatsoever', 'make', 'sure', 'simply', 'worked', 'right.It', 'safe', 'assume', 'someday', 'somewhere', 'CLAMP', 'penultimate', 'work', 'Card', 'Captor', 'Sakura', 'will', 'be', 'translated', 'Blu-ray', 'too', 'can', 'do', 'wait', 'hope', 'little', 'more', 'work', 'put', 'actually', 'worth', 'long', 'wait', 'beginning', 'sight', 'project', 'sort', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'totally', 'different', 'format', 'time', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'now.Worthless', 'insulting']",Chobits - The Chobits Collection

Many filler episodes early on made me wonder when they'd get to the point.  I was also reading the manga series at the time, which moved the plot along at a faster pace.Then the second half came along, and the plot picked up.  A new ending theme song began playing called ""Ningyo Hime"" which remains one of my favorite anime songs.  From here on, the story stayed true to the manga except for a different conclusion.  Once the story was fully covered, I was able to better appreciate the filler episodes for their charming situations and humor.The look of this series is gorgeous.  I liked the artwork in the manga, but it's definitely a step up to see it in full color and in motion.  The characters are voiced well, adequately bringing their personalities to life just as I imagined them when I read the manga.The music of this series can be best described as fun.  It's a lively soundtrack with tracks that made me think of old Care Bears cartoons.  It fits the series very well.  As an added bonus, this set comes with an audio CD, the ""Character Song Collection.""

For example, the movie Independence Day, the blu-ray version looks a lot sharper, but it won't have state of the art visual effects unless they are re-done.With that out of the way, I bought this blu-ray collection and I'm happy with it. You see, when playing DVDs, sometimes they will ""hiccup"" and you will see a pixelated mess. That's because of the way DVDs are played on your DVD player. Plus, the video and audio is all compressed to fit the discs and to lessen the stress of your DVD player. Blu-ray eliminated the need for compressed audio and video, and the way the disc is played. You now have a clean image and sound.In the case of Chobits, it looks slightly better. The colors are vivid, the sound is clearer (when played through an HDMI cable), and the series is as good as ever. Also, the packaging is pretty nice, though the slip out case is a little loose. It also has a reversible cover art. If you have the DVDs, then you may not want to buy the blu-ray version unless you're upgrading your collection.

917216,A6BHE6E9VV5BE,B0009ZE9QM,Nishi,"[3, 3]","Chobits is a Manga series that was adapted to an anime by the famous CLAMP. The story follows a Persocom named Chi that Hideki finds lying in the trash abandoned. The story is basically about the robot Chi learning all about life and Hideki's life in Japan. Episodes are basically around Chi learning something new, and usually something amusing goes wrong along the way.For an Anime that was made last decade it has pretty decent drawings and its widescreen, so you won't have to worry about those pesky bars at the side on a HDTV. Persocom's are easily identifiable but cat like ears on their head that are actually used as a USB like port to use them as a computer.For an anime that has only around 20 episodes, they have too many full recap episodes (Three in total), which slightly interrupts the viewing. One good thing about it though is that the main episodes are titled ""Chi something"", while the recaps are ""so and so story"". So you know what episodes you can completely skip entirely.If you like cutesy anime series then I recommend picking this up. Plot is pretty decent, and I love the futuristic android setting. It also has a good ending, and nothing like the typical open ended conclusions anime seems to have these days. This is also available on Netflix, I recommend watching this if you are at least a little bit interested it and you pay for Netflix streaming.~ Written: January, 2012Positive:* Persocom's are pretty awesome* Chi is extremely likeable* Some plot twists you don't even see coming* Good animation for a 2002 anime* Funimation picked it up to re-release Dub DVD'sNegative:* May not be for everyone",5,If you like cutesy anime series then I recommend picking this up,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1631,"['Chobits', 'Manga', 'series', 'was', 'adapted', 'anime', 'famous', 'CLAMP', 'story', 'Persocom', 'named', 'Chi', 'Hideki', 'lying', 'trash', 'abandoned', 'story', 'basically', 'robot', 'Chi', 'learning', 'life', 'Hideki', 'life', 'Japan', 'Episodes', 'are', 'basically', 'Chi', 'learning', 'something', 'new', 'usually', 'something', 'amusing', 'wrong', 'way.For', 'Anime', 'was', 'made', 'last', 'decade', 'pretty', 'decent', 'drawings', 'widescreen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'pesky', 'bars', 'side', 'HDTV', 'Persocom', 'are', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'cat', 'ears', 'head', 'are', 'actually', 'used', 'USB', 'port', 'use', 'computer.For', 'anime', 'only', 'around', '20', 'episodes', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'full', 'recap', 'episodes', 'Three', 'total', 'slightly', 'viewing', 'One', 'good', 'thing', 'main', 'episodes', 'are', 'titled', 'Chi', 'something', 'recaps', 'are', 'so', 'so', 'story', 'know', 'what', 'can', 'completely', 'skip', 'entirely.If', 'cutesy', 'anime', 'series', 'then', 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'Plot', 'pretty', 'decent', 'love', 'futuristic', 'android', 'setting', 'also', 'good', 'ending', 'nothing', 'typical', 'open', 'ended', 'conclusions', 'anime', 'have', 'days', 'also', 'available', 'Netflix', 'recommend', 'watching', 'are', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'interested', 'pay', 'Netflix', 'streaming.~', 'Written', 'January', '2012Positive', '*', 'Persocom', 'are', 'pretty', 'awesome*', 'Chi', 'extremely', 'likeable*', 'plot', 'twists', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'coming*', 'Good', 'animation', '2002', 'anime*', 'Funimation', 'picked', 'up', 're-release', 'Dub', ""DVD'sNegative"", '*', 'May', 'not', 'be', 'everyone']",Chobits - The Chobits Collection

It starts off fun and a bit silly at times in the beginning and progressively gets deeper and more serious as you progress with each connected episode.This is a real ""sleeper"" that will have you thinking about the issues raised hours after you have quit watching an episode. I know I did! It is also very timely as it deals with technology addiction issues, albeit in a future setting (30-40 years from now).The central issue of this story is what happens when technology reaches a level where the lines between what is human and what is machine blur and the impacts on human relations that can occur because of that blurring.My wife, who does not generally like anime, got hooked on this one and she told me it reminds her of a sci-fi soap opera in that it's a single story spread over 24 half hour episodes. For my part I got hooked on the story line almost from the beginning!Sound quality and graphics were very good as you would expect with a blu-ray version.My only complaint is that there weren't more episodes!If you are interested in good story telling based anime than I highly recommend that you purchase this anime series.

Technically, you cannot call it Kidporn, since she is an android.Will her little cybernetic heart eventually find love and happiness from a clueless young yokel ? From the opening credits, we are led to expect a heartwarming - if kinky - love story, with a happy ending.Instead of that, we are treated to a dark and convoluted whodunit (""it"" being the innocent cutie), along with somewhat uncomfortable allusions ( husbands neglecting their wives for computer ""yummies"" ).

917228,A1US7HC7RL2A8A,B0009ZE9QM,stowrag,"[12, 13]","Its easy to make assumptions about Chobits from just the first few episode: the main character, Hideki, immediately seems incredibly shallow, loud and seems to have mainly dirty thoughts on his mind.  The primary love interest is found half-naked, has no common sense, and her only purpose is apparently to appear adorably cute, and mimic Hideki, and unknowingly strike suggestive poses.  On top of that, Hideki immediately fantasizes that every girl he meets may be crushing on him.  In short, Chobits at first appears to be a very typical, very generic fan-service laden harem love story.  Luckily this isn't the case, and if it were, I couldn't possibly rate this show 5 stars.As the story goes on, the supporting characters develop their own complicated stories outside of Hideki, and Hideki's delusions of being the object of affection for every girl are revealed to be just that: delusions.  Chi grows into her own character, eventually learning how to speak, and the proper etiquette for living in society, and taking on a part time job.  And the fan-service... never really goes away, but it does lighten up considerably by the end.And rather than the story being about how awesome it would be to find a totally sexy, perfect robot girlfriend, the persocoms in Chobits are made imperfect themselves, and a variety of relationships are examined between humans and persocoms, like the rich recluse who's trying to replace a loved one with a persocom made in their image to the woman who was dumped for a persocom.  Ultimately, Hideki himself is redeemable if only because throughout most of the story, as he finds himself playing the supporting character in other people's romances, he takes it all in good stride: he's a good guy all in all, even if his over-the-top reactions and general helplessness get on your nerves.Aside from being much deeper than it first appears, Chobits looks and sounds great.  The opening theme is memorable and addictive, and the background music is a step or two above being generic or boring.  On top of that, the performances by the English voice-actors are surprisingly decent.  The Blu-ray looks great, and there are no significant imperfections revealed by whatever upscaling has been done.  Many people may remark that the blu-ray release doesn't really look any better than the DVD, and that may be true.  Televised anime series aren't made in a way that upscaling can really improve them a lot the way a blu-ray release can improve the quality of Lord of the Rings or something.  The advantages of having the blu-ray release is that you'll be able to watch Chobits on your blu-ray player into the next generation of media.I should mention that the reason I give this show only 4 out of 5 stars, isn't for the cheap fan-service, or slow, shallow beginning: Chobits was originally a manga (recently released in 2 omnibus editions from Dark Horse), and a lot of plot details have either been lost or changed in the translation.  Most notable are the changes to the ending, which is pretty awful compared to the original manga; it's confusing and doesn't really make any sense, while the manga is much simpler and better in every way.  I actually recommend the manga over the anime if you're not opposed to manga.  But while the manga has the better story, the anime contains more filler with Hideki and his persocom, which surprisingly are a delight to watch.  Chobits as a whole is a delight to watch, and I urge people not to be put off by it's shallow, formulaic first couple of episodes: it really does get better... until you get to the magical, nonsensical end.  Then I urge people to pick up the manga.",4,Not what it first appears,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,3652,"['easy', 'make', 'assumptions', 'Chobits', 'just', 'first', 'few', 'episode', 'main', 'character', 'Hideki', 'immediately', 'incredibly', 'shallow', 'loud', 'have', 'mainly', 'dirty', 'thoughts', 'mind', 'primary', 'love', 'interest', 'found', 'half-naked', 'common', 'sense', 'only', 'purpose', 'apparently', 'appear', 'adorably', 'cute', 'mimic', 'Hideki', 'unknowingly', 'strike', 'suggestive', 'poses', 'top', 'Hideki', 'immediately', 'girl', 'may', 'be', 'crushing', 'short', 'Chobits', 'first', 'be', 'very', 'typical', 'very', 'generic', 'fan-service', 'laden', 'harem', 'love', 'story', 'Luckily', ""n't"", 'case', 'were', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'rate', 'show', '5', 'stars.As', 'story', 'supporting', 'characters', 'develop', 'own', 'complicated', 'stories', 'Hideki', 'Hideki', 'delusions', 'being', 'object', 'affection', 'girl', 'are', 'revealed', 'be', 'just', 'delusions', 'Chi', 'own', 'character', 'eventually', 'learning', 'how', 'speak', 'proper', 'etiquette', 'living', 'society', 'taking', 'part', 'time', 'job', 'fan-service', 'never', 'really', 'away', 'lighten', 'up', 'considerably', 'end.And', 'rather', 'story', 'being', 'how', 'awesome', 'would', 'be', 'find', 'totally', 'sexy', 'perfect', 'robot', 'girlfriend', 'persocoms', 'Chobits', 'are', 'made', 'imperfect', 'variety', 'relationships', 'are', 'examined', 'humans', 'persocoms', 'rich', 'recluse', 'who', 'trying', 'replace', 'loved', 'one', 'persocom', 'made', 'image', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'dumped', 'persocom', 'Ultimately', 'Hideki', 'redeemable', 'only', 'most', 'story', 'playing', 'supporting', 'character', 'other', 'people', 'romances', 'good', 'stride', 'good', 'guy', 'even', 'over-the-top', 'reactions', 'general', 'helplessness', 'get', 'nerves.Aside', 'being', 'much', 'deeper', 'first', 'Chobits', 'great', 'opening', 'theme', 'memorable', 'addictive', 'background', 'music', 'step', 'two', 'being', 'generic', 'boring', 'top', 'performances', 'English', 'voice-actors', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'Blu-ray', 'great', 'are', 'significant', 'imperfections', 'revealed', 'upscaling', 'been', 'done', 'Many', 'people', 'may', 'remark', 'blu-ray', 'release', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'better', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'Televised', 'anime', 'series', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'way', 'upscaling', 'can', 'really', 'improve', 'lot', 'way', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'can', 'improve', 'quality', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'something', 'advantages', 'having', 'blu-ray', 'release', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'Chobits', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'next', 'generation', 'media.I', 'should', 'mention', 'reason', 'give', 'show', 'only', '4', '5', 'stars', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'fan-service', 'slow', 'shallow', 'beginning', 'Chobits', 'was', 'originally', 'manga', 'recently', 'released', '2', 'omnibus', 'editions', 'Dark', 'Horse', 'lot', 'plot', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'changed', 'translation', 'Most', 'notable', 'are', 'changes', 'ending', 'pretty', 'awful', 'compared', 'original', 'manga', 'confusing', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'manga', 'much', 'simpler', 'better', 'way', 'actually', 'recommend', 'manga', 'anime', ""'re"", 'not', 'opposed', 'manga', 'manga', 'better', 'story', 'anime', 'more', 'filler', 'Hideki', 'persocom', 'surprisingly', 'are', 'delight', 'watch', 'Chobits', 'whole', 'delight', 'watch', 'urge', 'people', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'shallow', 'formulaic', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'really', 'get', 'better', 'get', 'magical', 'nonsensical', 'end', 'Then', 'urge', 'people', 'pick', 'up', 'manga']",Chobits - The Chobits Collection

Chobits is about your typical country pumpkin goes to the big city to study for college entrance exams. In the city nearly everyone has human looking computers known as persicoms. Persicoms are the wonder machines of their age, able to anything and everything. They act and look so human that some people prefer them over humans. And of course or country pumpkin wants one. Unfortunately as expected persicoms cost a fortune to buy. Thus our Hideki gives up on getting his desire to get his hands on one until he finds one in trash. Seizing the opportunity Hideki ""liberates"" the periscom from the garbage takes it home. Once there he notices that the persicom is very very beautiful girl. Once figuring out how to turn her on he thinks his prays have come true. It then he gets his first problem, the persicom is basically a blank slate and can only say ""Chi"". Thus he names her Chi, and Chi is the cutest anime character I have ever seen! She is just so dang cute as she does everything Hideki does as she learns how to interact and live. Mysteries however quickly insue as all attempts to figure out how Chi works fail with only the cryptic legend of chobits, persicoms said to be able to feel.Is Chi a Chobits? If so what does that mean? And a whole list of things problems set in. From Getting Chi some clothes to keeping off perverts and figuring out just what she is. For the most part Chobits is a clean series with only a few out of place naughty jokes. The animation clearly that of its original creators CLAMP is clean crisp and possessing their singular smoothness. The music is somewhat forgettable. The plot is interesting as are the characters. The voice actors rather good. The philosophy somewhat interesting, asking such question as can a machine feel and such.The only real flaw being how much they left out from the manga. For instance the omission as to the purpose of the chobits. The relationship between the two syndicate persicoms and stuff like that. But I'm nit picking. The thing that gets on my nervs the most has to do with philosophy bit. Warning people may get ticked at this. Scientifically emotions are hormonal conditional responses triggered by the subconscious to external stimulus reacting as it learned is appropriate. In other words fundamentally there is every little if any difference between the reaction of a computer programed to react in a certain way from a human's reaction. So that knowledge kinda kills that question for me. Chi is sentient and acts in ways that portray emotion and claims to feel so good enough for me.

917233,A2BF3Z1UOWFBY,B0009ZE9QM,Upright Ape,"[5, 6]","I agree with the other reviews as far as the positive points of Chobits are concerned, so I won't go into detail therein.  Instead I'll concentrate on the negatives as follows:5 stars - for the series overall (per other positive reviews)Minus 1 star - for the usual Anime Male Idiot as a main character: a thoroughly aggravating, gynephobic, neurotic, socially crippled moron.  He starts coming to his senses in some of the later episodes, but not soon enough to salvage the 1 star penalty.Minus 1 star - for a weak series finale.  This came as no surprise to me, really.  Anime writers seem incapable of providing any kind of believable closure, either happy or sad.  They even foul up the ambiguous endings - the ones they intend to be ambiguous, that is.Don't worry about real spoilers here.  Without going into details about the exact nature of the happy vs. sad vs. ambiguous ending of Chobits, I can safely reveal that the finale has at least two manufactured crises (as in, ""So what?  What's the problem, all of a sudden?""), three totally arbitrary miracles, and a few meaningless setbacks to enable efficient switching back and forth between positive and negative outcomes - not necessarily in that order, so as not to spoil the ending for you.In addition, there are contradictory references to a series of books that ""Chi"" has been reading throughout the series.  The message of the books, somewhat consistent up until the last few epsiodes, suddenly starts reversing back and forth between happy vs. sad outcomes in tone.  In short, it all makes the presence of that book in the series utterly meaningless.Then there is the mysterious ""Syndicate"" (or something like that) behind the development of the ""Chobits"" robots.  It seems like a pretty ominous group, not to be taken lightly.  Yet its presence is completely lacking in the last episode.  There are some ""enemies"" of sorts present, but their connection to this ""Syndicate"", even if there is such a connection, is not adequately explained.  Not to me, anyway.Finally, there is some inexplicable activity on the part of one of the inventors of the special class of ""Chobits"" robots of which ""Chi"" is a member.  Like the book ""Chi"" has been reading, the inventor's agenda seems consistent up until the last few episodes.  Then she too reverses and re-reverses her role so often that you wonder why she was included in the series in the first place.OK, I went into the weak series ending at some length, probably unnecessarily so.  Anime fans are already familiar with botched series finales like this one.And despite the length and content of both negative criticisms, these faults do not completely destroy the series.  They can't, because it really is that good overall.  If you're reading this review and it dissuades you from watching Chobits, don't be discouraged.  Those positive points explored by other reviewers make it well worth viewing, negative stars notwithstanding (heck of a modifier, that last one - almost like something that can and can't stand up at the same time.  I wonder....).In addition, there is a final closure of sorts - it just doesn't follow from anything else that happens in the finale (I see from other reviews that the Manga version of the series clears up some of the conundrums in that last episode)I will say one good thing about the finale: when the Male Idiot becomes perturbed over an actual crisis for a change, he doesn't get a nosebleed from the excitement, wave his arms around like a windmill, or suffer the stock anime ""face wipe"" used to designate panic attacks.  He actually behaves the way a real person would when confronted by such an emergency.  That's rare in an Anime.Watch ""Chobits"".  It's fun, heartwarming, etc, and really funny when ""Chi"" is mimicking the Male Idiot's antics in her attempts to learn how to behave.  Who knows, you may even disagree with my assessment of the finale.  You'll agree with my criticisms of the Male Idiot though - I can guarantee that.PS: the music is nice too.UpRight Ape",3,"Good series, marred by the usual anime conventions",1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,4024,"['agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'as', 'far', 'positive', 'points', 'Chobits', 'are', 'concerned', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'therein', 'Instead', ""'ll"", 'concentrate', 'negatives', 'follows:5', 'stars', 'series', 'overall', 'other', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Minus', '1', 'star', 'usual', 'Anime', 'Male', 'Idiot', 'main', 'character', 'thoroughly', 'aggravating', 'gynephobic', 'neurotic', 'socially', 'crippled', 'moron', 'coming', 'senses', 'later', 'episodes', 'not', 'soon', 'enough', 'salvage', '1', 'star', 'penalty.Minus', '1', 'star', 'weak', 'series', 'finale', 'came', 'surprise', 'really', 'Anime', 'writers', 'seem', 'incapable', 'providing', 'kind', 'believable', 'closure', 'happy', 'sad', 'even', 'foul', 'up', 'ambiguous', 'endings', 'ones', 'intend', 'be', 'ambiguous', 'is.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'about', 'real', 'spoilers', 'here', 'going', 'details', 'exact', 'nature', 'happy', 'vs.', 'sad', 'vs.', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'Chobits', 'can', 'safely', 'reveal', 'finale', 'least', 'two', 'manufactured', 'crises', 'So', 'what', 'What', 'problem', 'sudden', 'three', 'totally', 'arbitrary', 'miracles', 'few', 'meaningless', 'setbacks', 'enable', 'efficient', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'positive', 'negative', 'outcomes', 'not', 'necessarily', 'order', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'ending', 'you.In', 'addition', 'are', 'contradictory', 'references', 'series', 'books', 'Chi', 'been', 'reading', 'series', 'message', 'books', 'somewhat', 'consistent', 'up', 'last', 'few', 'epsiodes', 'suddenly', 'reversing', 'back', 'forth', 'happy', 'vs.', 'sad', 'outcomes', 'tone', 'short', 'presence', 'book', 'series', 'utterly', 'meaningless.Then', 'mysterious', 'Syndicate', 'something', 'development', 'Chobits', 'robots', 'pretty', 'ominous', 'group', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'presence', 'completely', 'lacking', 'last', 'episode', 'are', 'enemies', 'sorts', 'present', 'connection', 'Syndicate', 'even', 'such', 'connection', 'not', 'adequately', 'explained', 'Not', 'anyway.Finally', 'inexplicable', 'activity', 'part', 'one', 'inventors', 'special', 'class', 'Chobits', 'robots', 'Chi', 'member', 'book', 'Chi', 'been', 'reading', 'inventor', 'agenda', 'consistent', 'up', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'Then', 'too', 'reverses', 're-reverses', 'role', 'so', 'often', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'included', 'series', 'first', 'place.OK', 'went', 'weak', 'series', 'ending', 'length', 'probably', 'unnecessarily', 'so', 'Anime', 'fans', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'botched', 'series', 'finales', 'one.And', 'length', 'content', 'negative', 'criticisms', 'faults', 'do', 'not', 'completely', 'destroy', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'overall', ""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'watching', 'Chobits', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'discouraged', 'positive', 'points', 'explored', 'other', 'reviewers', 'make', 'well', 'viewing', 'negative', 'stars', 'notwithstanding', 'heck', 'modifier', 'last', 'one', 'almost', 'something', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'wonder', '.In', 'addition', 'final', 'closure', 'sorts', 'just', ""n't"", 'follow', 'anything', 'else', 'finale', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'Manga', 'version', 'series', 'conundrums', 'last', 'episode', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'finale', 'when', 'Male', 'Idiot', 'perturbed', 'actual', 'crisis', 'change', ""n't"", 'get', 'nosebleed', 'excitement', 'wave', 'arms', 'windmill', 'suffer', 'stock', 'anime', 'face', 'wipe', 'used', 'designate', 'panic', 'attacks', 'actually', 'way', 'real', 'person', 'would', 'when', 'confronted', 'such', 'emergency', 'rare', 'Anime.Watch', 'Chobits', 'fun', 'heartwarming', 'etc', 'really', 'funny', 'when', 'Chi', 'mimicking', 'Male', 'Idiot', 'antics', 'attempts', 'learn', 'how', 'behave', 'Who', 'may', 'even', 'disagree', 'assessment', 'finale', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'criticisms', 'Male', 'Idiot', 'can', 'guarantee', 'that.PS', 'music', 'nice', 'too.UpRight', 'Ape']",Chobits - The Chobits Collection

Then she must have superpowers and we're going to save to world/fall in love!""Definitely worth the buy to keep in your collection, and show your support for the authors; piracy is at an all time high, and demand is at an all time low.",5,"Worth the buy, show your support!",1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,792,"['CLAMP', 'never', 'failed', 'impress', 'books', 'fact', 'expect', 'good', 'work', 'was', 'still', 'surprised', 'series.Sure', 'generic', 'story', 'line', 'average', 'college', 'boy', 'who', 'stumble', 'extraordinary', 'girl', 'etc', 'etc.', 'definitely', 'unique', 'points', 'too.It', 'almost', 'authors', 'wrote', 'parody', 'other', 'animes', 'making', 'fun', 'generic', 'scripts', 'plot', 'lines', 'Very', 'unorthodox', 'funny', 'gut', 'was', 'splitting', 'few', 'times', 'Things', 'main', 'char', 'saying', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'poor', 'guy', 'stumbled', 'girl', 'Then', 'must', 'have', 'superpowers', ""'re"", 'going', 'save', 'world/fall', 'love', 'Definitely', 'buy', 'keep', 'collection', 'show', 'support', 'authors', 'piracy', 'time', 'high', 'demand', 'time', 'low']",Chobits - The Chobits Collection
