1528917,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B007AFS18G,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""Chuck"" spent its entire five year run on NBC on the verge of cancellation, saved year after year by a small but vocal and dedicated fan base that appreciated the show's unique blend of comedy, action, and romance.  The series featured Chuck Bartkowski as a slacker computer nerd at an L.A. box store, whose life changed dramatically after a secret database called the Intersect was emplanted in his brain by a rogue agent.  Suddenly, the bumbling Chuck was leading a double life, working at the BuyMore Electronics Store by day and as a secret agent by night.  Beautiful CIA Agent Sarah Walker was his handler and bodyguard, assisted by hardnosed NSA assassin Major John Casey.  The reluctant Chuck was drawn into a world of secrets, spies, and terorists, endangering himself and his unknowing friends and extended family.Chuck was always a reluctant hero, but he always tried to do the right thing, something that endeared him to audiences and to his co-workers.  Over the seasons, Chuck and Team Bartkowski got progressively tougher assignments and foiled a long string of wonderfully nefarious guest villains.  Chuck's extended family, including sister Ellie and future brother in law Captain Awesome, long missing relatives, and co-workers like best buddy Morgan, were drawn into Chuck's secret.  The show always managed to find the humor in Chuck's situations, while ripping off the best of any number of storylines from television and movies.At the center of the show was the long simmering romance between Chuck and Sara, a romance that followed a difficult road and eventually came full circle at the conclusion of the show.  If you've seen it, you'll want to see it again.  If you haven't, you have something to look forward to.

The writers strike shorten season 1. If it weren't for the outcry from the public (and the fact NBC had nothing else to offer) plus a lot of help from Subway for season there would not have been a Season 3. Probably the best of the five seasons. Probably the most interesting character Brandon Routh character Daniel Shaw. He went from an All-American hero to a bitter traitor once he learned the truth about his wife's death. A tragic character .The my least favorite scene was when Ellie watches her father being murdered in front of her.  In Season we meet Chuck's mother and learn the reason why she left her family. Plus the second most interesting character in Timothy Dalton's character Alexi Volkoff . I was disappointed in Season 5 and the way the series was wrapped up. It was interesting to learn more about John Casey past and the introduction of his daughter Alex in season three.

How do I write a recommendation for the best TV show I have ever seen, when I know that even so, not everyone will like it? It is also hard to describe since it is so funny yet not a sit-com, action-packed yet not just an action show, poignant yet not a drama and while it has a Sci-Fi premise, it is not really Sci-Fi. It does seamlessly blend all of these elements, however. The scripts are mostly superb, awesome even. The Emmy award-winning action sequences are also great, despite the low budget. The acting from both the two leads and all the supporting cast is flawless. All the characters evolve and grow through each of the seasons and you come to care for them all, even the Buy More characters that may initially annoy.Perhaps it would help to try and say what Chuck might be made from, and if you like any of these ingredients, you may also like Chuck. Start with a generous helping of True Lies and blend it with Red and all the Sean Connery James Bond movies. Add some Big Bang Theory and then go back to the 60&#8217;s and add a teaspoon each of Mission Impossible, Get Smart and The Avengers (the one with Steed and Mrs. Peel, not the superheroes&#8230;). Mix thoroughly in a bowl forged from Casablanca or&#8230;OK I&#8217;m a guy so I&#8217;m struggling a bit with this one, insert whatever love story you relate to... Because what makes Chuck better than all of the movies and shows that it could be compared to, is its heart. The Chuck and Sarah love story, and the amazing acting by Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski that makes you believe it, lifts Chuck above all other TV shows I have ever seen. Sometimes the nerd gets the girl.My only regret is that I started watching this on Netflix long after the show had been cancelled. I would have happily bought a hundred foot-longs, for just one more episode. So trust me, don&#8217;t freak out, join the Nerd Herd and unleash the Casey.

My wife likes it because Sarah generally wears sensible shoes to chase down bad guys, not high heels or wedges. I don't really care about that. Words of warning. If you are sensitive about being of short or average height, find something else. Three of the main characters are 6'4"". Sara's 5'10"". Morgan, at 5'7"" looks like he's part of the lollipop club. No, I don't know what I mean by that but I somehow believe that I made my point.This is worth every penny. Love it.
