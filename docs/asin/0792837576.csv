138463,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0792837576,C. O. DeRiemer,"[7, 9]","This is a musical which is instantly recognizable as having come from the Sixties. The Technicolor is bright with lots of reds and oranges and yellows. The dresses look like Doris Day would be comfortable in them. The hairdos are shiny helmets.It also is one of the most cynically good-natured satires on business you'll ever hope to see. Young J. Pierpont Finch (Robert Morse) reads a book on getting ahead in business and is inspired to try his luck with the World Wide Wicket Company. Within a day, through affectionate rear-end kissing, ego massaging, opportunism and happy toadying, he has advanced from window washer to mail room clerk to...junior executive. And he's just starting. By the end of the movie he's the chairman, found the love of his life, himself, as well as cute secretary Rosemary Pilkington (Michele Lee), waved the old chairman, J. B. Biggley (Rudy Vallee), into a happy retirement, and shown the door to Biggley's fawning and ambitious nephew, Bud Frump (Anthony Teague).Along the way we've encountered some of Frank Loesser's funniest songs and some of Abe Burrows sharpest lines. ""Last month,"" says Mr. Twimble, Ponty's mailroom boss, ""I became a quarter-of-a-century man."" ""Oh,"" says Finch, ""that's beautiful, a quarter-of-a-century. How long have you been in the mail room?"" ""Twenty-five years,"" says Twimble. ""It's not easy to get this medal. It takes a combination of skill, diplomacy, and bold caution"".Loesser's lyrics are funny, sharp-edged but not mean-spirited. Twimble, for instance, explains his philosophy in The Company Way: ""When I joined this firm as a brash young man,""Well, I said to myself, 'Now, brash young man, don't get any ideas.'""Well, I stuck to that, and I haven't had one in years.""Says Finch: ""You play it safe.""""I play it the company way"", sings Twimble, ""wherever the company puts me there I stay.""""But what is your point of view?,"" says Finch.""I have no point of view.""Says Finch: ""Supposing the company thinks . . .""""I think so too.""The hit of the show, I Believe in You, goes like this:You have the cool, clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth;Yet there's that upturned chin and that grin of impetuous youth.Oh, I believe in you.I believe in you.I hear the sound of good, solid judgment whenever you talk;Yet there's the bold, brave spring of the tiger that quickens your walk.Oh, I believe in you.I believe in you.And when my faith in my fellow manAll but falls apart,I've but to feel your hand grasping mineAnd I take heart; I take heartTo see the cool, clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth;Yet, with the slam-bang tang reminiscent of gin and vermouth.Oh, I believe in you.I believe in you.A great love song...and Finch is singing it to himself while he gazes into a mirror.Morse does a terrific job. He's full of energy and charm, even when he's brown-nosing...which he's doing most of the time. It's kind of unsettling to imagine Finch now as the CEO of World Wide Wicket, scratching the stomachs of tame board members so they'll give him a $700 million retirement package, building an $80 million ego mansion for him and his new trophy wife (he traded in Rosemary some years ago), and regaling his CEO buddies with tales of the $10 million birthday bash he secretly got his company's shareholders to pay for.

138464,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,0792837576,Cowboy Buddha,"[7, 7]","A bright and breezy and somewhat cynical 1960's musical comedy satire of American big business with lots of energy, some good (but not great) songs and a powerhouse of a central performance, How To Succeed In Business is a pleasant romp that can by enjoyed by everyone but especially appreciated by anyone who has ever had to work in an office. Its silly story of a guy who uses a ""how to"" book to progress from window washer to company president is like a modern urban fairy tale with music, romance, and a bit of sex thrown in. If it has a moral (which is doubtful) it is to demonstrate to the anti-Establishment mob that being part of the Establishment could be fun too.Leading the way and holding the whole thing together is Robert Morse, reprising his Broadway role as J. Pierrepont Finch in a super star-making performance. Morse's long experience with this character is obvious as he sings, dances, grins, mugs and schemes his way through the film. He is never better than when performing his big number ""I Believe In You"" - sung to his reflection in the mirror of the executive washroom.A couple of other players from the Broadway original are also in the film, most notably Sammy Smith (again playing two roles) and veteran crooner Rudy Vallee. Michelle Lee is pert and pretty as Morse's love interest, Anthony Teague (one of the Jets in West Side Story) is the slimy boss's nephew, and Maureen Arthur provides more than a dash of sex appeal as an inept secretary. But the show really belongs to Robert Morse.The bouncy songs are by ace tunesmith Frank Loesser (this was his followup to his classic Guys And Dolls). Unfortunately, as so often happens with Hollywood versions of Broadway shows, some of the songs got dropped with gems such as ""Coffee Break"" and ""Paris Original"" among the lamented casualties. But the songs that remain are enthusiastically and imaginatively performed, especially the popular ""A Secretary Is Not A Toy"".I have heard, but never been able to confirm, that this film was released in France with all the songs removed - that it was shown as just a comedy. If so, it is a good indication of just how strong and funny the script is on its own. It also tells us something about the weirdness of the French...For the rest of us, How To Succeed In Business remains a fun time to be enjoyed by all. It never takes itself seriously and that is one of its great virtues. Its other assets are color, laughs, music, slapstick, sex, and - more than anything else - Robert Morse. He was great on stage - he's great in this movie.",4,How To Succeed As A Musical,1093996800,"09 1, 2004",2004,2554,"['bright', 'breezy', 'somewhat', 'cynical', '1960', 'musical', 'comedy', 'satire', 'American', 'big', 'business', 'lots', 'energy', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'songs', 'powerhouse', 'central', 'performance', 'How', 'Succeed', 'Business', 'pleasant', 'romp', 'can', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'work', 'office', 'silly', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'how', 'book', 'progress', 'window', 'washer', 'company', 'president', 'modern', 'urban', 'fairy', 'tale', 'music', 'romance', 'bit', 'sex', 'thrown', 'moral', 'doubtful', 'demonstrate', 'anti-Establishment', 'mob', 'being', 'part', 'Establishment', 'could', 'be', 'fun', 'too.Leading', 'way', 'holding', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'Robert', 'Morse', 'reprising', 'Broadway', 'role', 'J.', 'Pierrepont', 'Finch', 'super', 'star-making', 'performance', 'Morse', 'long', 'experience', 'character', 'obvious', 'dances', 'grins', 'mugs', 'schemes', 'way', 'film', 'never', 'better', 'when', 'performing', 'big', 'number', 'Believe', 'sung', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'executive', 'washroom.A', 'couple', 'other', 'players', 'Broadway', 'original', 'are', 'also', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'Sammy', 'Smith', 'again', 'playing', 'two', 'roles', 'veteran', 'crooner', 'Rudy', 'Vallee', 'Michelle', 'Lee', 'pert', 'pretty', 'Morse', 'love', 'interest', 'Anthony', 'Teague', 'one', 'Jets', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'slimy', 'boss', 'nephew', 'Maureen', 'Arthur', 'more', 'dash', 'sex', 'appeal', 'inept', 'secretary', 'show', 'really', 'Robert', 'Morse.The', 'bouncy', 'songs', 'are', 'ace', 'tunesmith', 'Frank', 'Loesser', 'was', 'followup', 'classic', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'often', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'Broadway', 'shows', 'songs', 'got', 'dropped', 'gems', 'such', 'Coffee', 'Break', 'Paris', 'Original', 'lamented', 'casualties', 'songs', 'remain', 'are', 'enthusiastically', 'imaginatively', 'performed', 'especially', 'popular', 'A', 'Secretary', 'Not', 'Toy', '.I', 'have', 'heard', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'confirm', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'France', 'songs', 'removed', 'was', 'shown', 'as', 'just', 'comedy', 'so', 'good', 'indication', 'just', 'how', 'strong', 'funny', 'script', 'own', 'also', 'something', 'weirdness', 'French', 'rest', 'How', 'Succeed', 'Business', 'fun', 'time', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'never', 'seriously', 'one', 'great', 'virtues', 'other', 'assets', 'are', 'color', 'music', 'slapstick', 'sex', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Robert', 'Morse', 'was', 'great', 'stage', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

The company is just large enough so that no one knows what is actually going on, leadership cries out for creative solutions then promptly fires any one who shows a talent for it, and promotion doesn't hinge so much upon ability as it does upon [kissing] up, backstabbing, and looking like you know what you're doing.

And along the way our hero meets the classic business crowd: the company man, the bombshell secretary, the boss' nephew, and a host of largely incompetent yes-men VPs.The film is very stylized, making no pretense at naturalism per se, and the cast follows suit, playing in a way that blends beautifully with the self-boosting and jingoistic tone that pervades the piece.  Robert Morse gives a truly brilliant performance in the lead--and one wonders why Hollywood so seldom used him in later years; Michele Lee, as the secretary who befriends him, is equally fine, and the supporting cast is wonderful all the way around.  The musical numbers (which includes such numbers as ""The Company Way,"" ""A Secretary Is Not A Toy,"" ""It's Been A Long Day,"" and ""Brotherhood of Man"") are remarkably sly and memorably performed.  All in all, HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING is sure to appeal to any one who has had the misfortune to graple with the idiocies of corporate America--and it will almost certainly outrage every ""company man"" on your city block.

The film's title refers to a self-help book that J. Peerpont Finch continually refers to in his bid to climb the corporate ladder (The initials, ""J.P. (Julius Peerpont) may seem familiar, as they were also the moniker of TV clown J.P. Patches, played by Daryl Laub and Chris Wedes in Minneapolis and Seattle). Leonard Maltin gave this movie three and a half stars, and Robert Osborne notes that in the film version, the character of Finch was made more loveable. So forget there was ever a play, and settle in for a great movie experience.If you're a fan of the four color Technicolor look of '60s movies, as I am, or of the exciting visual look of Panavision, a then new technique so amazing as to lure audiences back to the theaters and away from the small screen, you're in for a treat. As for the cast, Robert Morse as Finch is a ball of fire. Bob Fosse's choreography is not over the top as with many memorable musicals, and provides for interludes without intruding. The songs by Frank Loesser are also somewhat muted from the usual musical fireworks, although the climactic number, ""The Brotherhood of Man"", infuses the '50s ""Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" doldrums with a sense of camaraderie and lifts it to the level of gospel.Not to mention a stellar cast including Michele Lee, David Swift, Maureen Arthur, Sammy Smith, Robert Q.

138482,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,0792837576,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[34, 34]","The 1967 musical comedy ""How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying"" is based upon a 1962 Broadway musical of the same name, as well as the similarly titled novel that was written by Shepherd Mead.  The story begins with J. Pierpont Finch (Robert Morse) who works as a skyscraper window washer.  He finds and begins to read a self-help book entitled ""How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying"".  Following advice from the book and while washing windows outside, he sneaks into of an office of the World Wide Wicket Corporation (WWWC).  Quickly stripping out of his orange window-washing coveralls, Finch wears a smart business suit beneath and quickly endears himself to the company's president, J.B. Biggley (Rudy Vallee), one of the secretaries, Rosemary Pilkington (Michelle Lee), as well as a host of yes-men vice presidents.  Impressed, J.B. sends Finch to the personnel office to be promptly hired to work in the company's mailroom.  There, Finch meets J.B.'s nephew, Bud Frump (Anthony Teague), who also works for WWWC in the mailroom.  Continuing to follow advice from the self-help book, Finch finagles and brownnoses his way up the corporate ladder in record speed and develops a love interest with Rosemary, but not everyone is happy with Finch's rise within the company.  J.B. also hires a very attractive 'friend', Hedy LaRue (Maureen Arthur), who has little experience working in an office, but has a lot of experience with men.The engaging, original music in the film, which was written by Frank Loesser, includes the songs:* ""How To"" (sung by Robert Morse).* ""The Company Way"" (sung by Robert Morse).* ""A Secretary Is Not A Toy"" (sung by company employees).* ""Been A Long Day"" (sung by company employees).* ""Rosemary"" (sung by Robert Morse).* ""Grand Old Ivy"" (sung by Robert Morse and Rudy Vallee).* ""I Believe In You"" (sung by Michelle Lee).* ""Brotherhood Of Man"" (sung by company employees).Though some of the activities shown in ""How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" are dated and chauvinistic by today's business standards (and discouraged by the Labor Department and the EEOC), the basic message of the story regarding nepotism, brownnosing, favoritism, scapegoating, affairs between employees, people hired for their appearance, backstabbing and mismanagement within corporations is just as relevant today as it was over 40 years ago.  Creative employees are summarily fired for their ideas, others with more corporate clout get those same ideas approved by management.  People who went to the right schools or joined the right clubs move up quickly, as well as people who easily agree with superiors and/or dress as well as possible.  It's not what you know, but who you know, how well you brownnose, how good of an appearance you make and how well you avoid trouble that makes one successful in the corporate world.Robert Morse is hilarious in the film, as are Rudy Vallee, Maureen Arthur and Michelle Lee.  The film was well scripted and the sets are appropriate for a late 1960's office building.  It is likely that the film inspired Michael J. Fox's 1987 film, ""The Secret of My Succe$s"".

That is why this musical is a true mockery of the corporate world, which is in turn why it made my musical-mocking husband laugh out loud and physically turn away from the computer to watch.Before I bought the DVD version of How to $ucceed, I had seen it performed live.  I loved it and subsequently purchased the soundtrack featuring Matthew Broderick.So, as you can see, it was with an already deep affection for (and prejudiced mind) that I bought the movie version.  It surprised me greatly that this vision of How to $ucceed met up to my already high standards.  Only a few songs from the musical were not included.  But the movie is 2 hours long, so it was necessary to do some cutting.If you like musicals, if you like big business, if you like to make fun of big business, this movie will make you laugh.As far as the DVD goes, there were not a lot of special features, which is to be expected from an older film.  It did include the trailer, which was amusing in its retro-style, and it's nice to be able to go back and play the scene of a particular song I liked here and there.  The widescreen version really enhanced the film for me, especially when my cats decided to nap lazily on the television and dangle their limbs about while I was watching.Good movie!",5,Wonderful Re-creation of the Musical,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,1366,"['musical', 'transcends', 'time', 'What', 'was', 'true', '1960s', 'still', 'true', 'today', 'why', 'musical', 'true', 'mockery', 'corporate', 'world', 'turn', 'why', 'made', 'musical-mocking', 'husband', 'loud', 'physically', 'turn', 'away', 'computer', 'watch.Before', 'bought', 'DVD', 'version', 'How', 'ucceed', 'had', 'seen', 'performed', 'live', 'loved', 'subsequently', 'purchased', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Matthew', 'Broderick.So', 'can', 'see', 'was', 'already', 'deep', 'affection', 'prejudiced', 'mind', 'bought', 'movie', 'version', 'surprised', 'greatly', 'vision', 'How', 'ucceed', 'met', 'up', 'already', 'high', 'standards', 'Only', 'few', 'songs', 'musical', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'movie', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'was', 'necessary', 'do', 'cutting.If', 'musicals', 'like', 'big', 'business', 'like', 'make', 'fun', 'big', 'business', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'laugh.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'were', 'not', 'lot', 'special', 'features', 'be', 'expected', 'older', 'film', 'did', 'include', 'trailer', 'was', 'amusing', 'retro-style', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'play', 'scene', 'particular', 'song', 'liked', 'here', 'there', 'widescreen', 'version', 'really', 'enhanced', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'cats', 'decided', 'nap', 'lazily', 'television', 'dangle', 'limbs', 'was', 'watching.Good', 'movie']",N/A

It follows the rapid advance of a window washer (Robert Morse) in the corporate world, exploring every way to get ahead except for hard work:  Sucking up, stealing credit, shifting blame; it's all here, with a measure of cynical humor worthy of The Simpsons.  As Morse works his way up from the mail room to VP of Advertising, he falls in love with secretary Rosemary (Michele Lee).  Rudy Vallee, rarely seen in the movies, has a major role as the president of the World Wide Wicket company.  There are several good songs, mostly with humorous lines in clever rhyming schemes, including ""The Company Way,"" ""Been A Long Day,"" ""Rosemary,"" and the redeeming ""Brotherhood of Man.""

Sexual harassment is passed off as a joke and the secretaries are basically seen as empty-headed airheads who spend their days filing their nails and waiting for coffee breaks.Still, this could be chalked up to the era's biases (just the same as Lord of the Rings being full of useless women because Tolkien was a sexist) if it wasn't for some very deep problems in the movie itself.The sex kitten secretary is not sexy in the slightest.
