827695,A3JTBRDRK6Q0M3,B000298WFE,24/F Review,"[7, 10]","This is the film that rocked the Venice film festival last year and was deemed ""undistributable"" in its uncensored form. It follows four dysfunctional teenagers and their families in the skateboarding community of Visalia, California. There's Peaches, the 16-year old schoolgirl raised by a religiously fanatical father, Tate jerks off while watching pro tennis on TV, skateboarder Claude is the object of his father's obsession, while Shawn sleeps with his girlfriend's mother.Self-confessed Wong Kar-wai admirer Larry Clark (who also directed KIDS) is a former photographer, and it's obvious in the way that the film is presented. Rather than tell a single, coherent story, Clark takes ""mobile snapshots"" of the characters. There are no explanations here, only portraits. Neither is there any beginning, middle, or end a fact reinforced by the use of the titular character's suicide as a framing device. Despite this, the film never feels confusing or disjointed: it's merely like walking through an art exhibit and leaving one portrait to proceed to the next.Envelope-pushing topics portrayed include explicit teenage sex; autoerotic asphyxiation; bondage sex; incest; masturbation; threesomes; full-frontal nudity (both male and female); murder and drug use. The notoriety of the hardcore sex scenes is perhaps best explained by Clark himself: ""In this movie, I'm showing everything. For every vagina, there's a penis."" That's a lot to tackle in one film, but Clark tries his best to keep the film from straying into the realms of sensationalist exploitation and for the most part, he succeeds.The characters depicted in Ken Park are exaggerations of reality but they were not so unrealistic that I couldn't identify with them. Even if they're not the kids next door, they could still exist in real life. We read more extreme examples in the newspapers everyday.Although the majority of the cinema-going public may flinch at such a graphic depiction of modern teen life, it's vital that artists keep producing works that are true to life and that challenge our moral sensibilities.",4,"""Mobile"" snapshots",1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,2085,"['film', 'rocked', 'Venice', 'film', 'festival', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'deemed', 'undistributable', 'uncensored', 'form', 'four', 'dysfunctional', 'teenagers', 'families', 'skateboarding', 'community', 'Visalia', 'California', 'Peaches', '16-year', 'old', 'schoolgirl', 'raised', 'religiously', 'fanatical', 'father', 'Tate', 'off', 'watching', 'pro', 'tennis', 'TV', 'skateboarder', 'Claude', 'object', 'father', 'obsession', 'Shawn', 'sleeps', 'girlfriend', 'mother.Self-confessed', 'Wong', 'Kar-wai', 'admirer', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'KIDS', 'former', 'photographer', 'obvious', 'way', 'film', 'presented', 'Rather', 'tell', 'single', 'coherent', 'story', 'Clark', 'mobile', 'snapshots', 'characters', 'are', 'explanations', 'here', 'only', 'there', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'fact', 'reinforced', 'use', 'titular', 'character', 'suicide', 'framing', 'device', 'film', 'never', 'confusing', 'disjointed', 'merely', 'like', 'walking', 'art', 'exhibit', 'leaving', 'one', 'portrait', 'proceed', 'next.Envelope-pushing', 'topics', 'portrayed', 'include', 'explicit', 'teenage', 'sex', 'autoerotic', 'asphyxiation', 'bondage', 'sex', 'incest', 'masturbation', 'threesomes', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'murder', 'drug', 'use', 'notoriety', 'hardcore', 'sex', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'best', 'explained', 'Clark', 'movie', ""'m"", 'showing', 'everything', 'vagina', 'penis', 'lot', 'tackle', 'one', 'film', 'Clark', 'best', 'keep', 'film', 'straying', 'realms', 'sensationalist', 'exploitation', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'depicted', 'Ken', 'Park', 'are', 'exaggerations', 'reality', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'could', ""n't"", 'identify', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'kids', 'door', 'could', 'still', 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'read', 'more', 'extreme', 'examples', 'newspapers', 'majority', 'cinema-going', 'public', 'may', 'flinch', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'modern', 'teen', 'life', 'vital', 'keep', 'producing', 'works', 'are', 'true', 'life', 'challenge', 'moral', 'sensibilities']",N/A

827697,A928WN8NV03WZ,B000298WFE,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[32, 68]","I think that the director Larry Park is trying to mature as a filmaker.  But it reminds me of Johnny Depp when he tried to break the teen dream image he'd gotten with his work on 21 jump street.  First he did Crybaby, great for an image breaker and parody.  Then he did Benny and Joon, making him a teen star again.  This is the same with Larry Clark, he did an ok movie with Bully, based off a true, then goes to this cheap attempt to push the envelope.  Which has been called kiddy porn by some that I know who've seen it, and a long episode of the springer show by others.I know that there are some people that call it art, and I can see some of the reasons for what he was doing, but it isn't art.  It is a cheap attempt to push the envelope and guise it as art.  Which seems to be a fad of recent years.  Artistic movies have to be something the majority doesn't like, finds shocking, or thinks bizarre, not necessarily because of any message,by design, or due to quality, which this movie is sadly lacking in.  This is an exploitation movie, pure and simple.The movie is a set of short stories based off a group of skaters in california.  Though I appreciate the gritty low budget look to it, and the usage of realistic looking actors, this is where my appreciation ends.The first story is a boy that is supposed to be 15 or 16, but looks 12.  He is cheating on his girlfriend to his girlfriends 30+ mother with bad breast implants and a very graphic scene of him performing oral sex on her.  Then a scene of him talking to her about how different she and her daughter are in bed.  The actor playing the kid has about zero charisma, looking like he really doesn't want to be there.Then there is a story that I could actually feel something for, a boy whose father felt he was a disspointment.  His son was a scrawny skater and he was a muscular former tough guy who was down on his luck.  You could tell he was focing on his son due to his lack of success.  This was plausible until for no apparent reason, no signs, just out of the blue, decided to try to perform oral sex on his son while he is sleeping.There is a kid who lives with his grandparents who was a thoroughly despicable person.  Good actor, but I didn't like his angry abusive character at all after he berates his grandmother for bringing him a snack while he was working.  I wouldn't expect to see him much, as they decide to throw in a scene where he masturbates to womens tennis, all to a money shot.There is a girl that is of course easy and into kinky sex.  Her father is mexican puritan, who eats while kneeling on the floor, and obviously fixated on turning his daughter into the same woman his deceased wife was.  Though the girl is smart, she doesn't show it by tying her boyfriend up while in her house counting on her father(who is obviously unbalanced), be away long enough to be undisturbed.The biggest point made about this movie was that it was showing how these people all had messed up lives, and sex was their only refuge.  But there are a million other ways this could have been shown that would portray this.  Plus the Springer elements of the plot really drug it down to ridiculous lows.  None of the characters are remotely interesting or people you would can care about.  The dull kid who cheats on his girlfriend to his girlfriends mother and friend.  The skater who is in a bad situation, but is a boring and not terribly intelligent person.  The sleezy girl who is supposed to be a brain, but does incredibly stupid things, etc.....  The acting was a mixed bag, some great, some outright horrid.  the filming was freash and gritty, but relied on shock value of kids who are young, and looking even younger in a porn like situations.  Like the pointles scene of group sex at the end of the movie where they talk in between scenes of two guys going over the girl.  I guess it was trying to be profound.I think that this movie was right being barred from release.  Not only from the cheap scenes of under ages kids and sex, but because it is terrible and should never be released on this merit alone.  So dont' buy it, don't download it, and sway anyone from seeing it.",1,as artistic as an episode of the springer show,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,4164,"['think', 'director', 'Larry', 'Park', 'trying', 'mature', 'filmaker', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'when', 'tried', 'break', 'teen', 'dream', 'image', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'work', '21', 'jump', 'street', 'First', 'did', 'Crybaby', 'great', 'image', 'breaker', 'parody', 'Then', 'did', 'Benny', 'Joon', 'making', 'teen', 'star', 'again', 'same', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'did', 'ok', 'movie', 'Bully', 'based', 'off', 'true', 'then', 'cheap', 'attempt', 'push', 'envelope', 'been', 'called', 'kiddy', 'porn', 'know', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'episode', 'springer', 'show', 'others.I', 'know', 'are', 'people', 'call', 'art', 'can', 'see', 'reasons', 'what', 'was', 'doing', ""n't"", 'art', 'cheap', 'attempt', 'push', 'envelope', 'guise', 'art', 'be', 'fad', 'recent', 'years', 'Artistic', 'movies', 'have', 'be', 'something', 'majority', ""n't"", 'like', 'shocking', 'bizarre', 'not', 'necessarily', 'message', 'design', 'due', 'quality', 'movie', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'exploitation', 'movie', 'pure', 'simple.The', 'movie', 'set', 'short', 'stories', 'based', 'off', 'group', 'skaters', 'california', 'appreciate', 'gritty', 'low', 'budget', 'look', 'usage', 'realistic', 'looking', 'actors', 'where', 'appreciation', 'first', 'story', 'boy', 'supposed', 'be', '15', '16', '12', 'cheating', 'girlfriend', 'girlfriends', '30+', 'mother', 'bad', 'breast', 'implants', 'very', 'graphic', 'scene', 'performing', 'oral', 'sex', 'Then', 'scene', 'talking', 'how', 'different', 'daughter', 'are', 'bed', 'actor', 'playing', 'kid', 'zero', 'charisma', 'looking', 'really', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there.Then', 'story', 'could', 'actually', 'feel', 'something', 'boy', 'father', 'felt', 'was', 'disspointment', 'son', 'was', 'scrawny', 'skater', 'was', 'muscular', 'former', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'down', 'luck', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'focing', 'son', 'due', 'lack', 'success', 'was', 'plausible', 'apparent', 'reason', 'signs', 'just', 'blue', 'decided', 'try', 'perform', 'oral', 'sex', 'son', 'sleeping.There', 'kid', 'who', 'grandparents', 'who', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'despicable', 'person', 'Good', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'angry', 'abusive', 'character', 'grandmother', 'bringing', 'snack', 'was', 'working', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'much', 'decide', 'throw', 'scene', 'where', 'womens', 'tennis', 'money', 'shot.There', 'girl', 'course', 'easy', 'kinky', 'sex', 'father', 'mexican', 'puritan', 'who', 'kneeling', 'floor', 'obviously', 'fixated', 'turning', 'daughter', 'same', 'woman', 'deceased', 'wife', 'was', 'girl', 'smart', ""n't"", 'show', 'tying', 'boyfriend', 'up', 'house', 'counting', 'father', 'who', 'obviously', 'unbalanced', 'be', 'away', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'undisturbed.The', 'biggest', 'point', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'showing', 'how', 'people', 'had', 'messed', 'up', 'lives', 'sex', 'was', 'only', 'refuge', 'are', 'million', 'other', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'would', 'portray', 'Springer', 'elements', 'plot', 'really', 'drug', 'down', 'ridiculous', 'lows', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'people', 'would', 'can', 'care', 'about', 'dull', 'kid', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'girlfriends', 'mother', 'friend', 'skater', 'who', 'bad', 'situation', 'boring', 'not', 'terribly', 'intelligent', 'person', 'sleezy', 'girl', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'brain', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'things', 'etc', 'acting', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag', 'great', 'outright', 'horrid', 'filming', 'was', 'freash', 'gritty', 'relied', 'shock', 'value', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'young', 'looking', 'even', 'younger', 'porn', 'situations', 'pointles', 'scene', 'group', 'sex', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'talk', 'scenes', 'two', 'guys', 'going', 'girl', 'guess', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'profound.I', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'right', 'being', 'barred', 'release', 'Not', 'only', 'cheap', 'scenes', 'ages', 'kids', 'sex', 'terrible', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'released', 'merit', 'alone', 'So', 'dont', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'download', 'sway', 'anyone', 'seeing']",N/A

827699,AP839YM0XJ664,B000298WFE,Ang Poon Kah,"[3, 26]","The story work around four youngsters (3 males and one female) which comes from a poor family background. I just use a, b, c and d to represent a, b and c are males character and d is female. The story basically is talking about the normal and sexual life of these youngsters. Let me start with a's story. He skate to a family where a young girl is watching pornographic video while a went up to the mother of that young girl(his girlfriend's mother). He later did some 'sexual' act with the mom which invites him to go near to her under(between the legs) to lick.(This is the part where is common possibly in playboy, reason for its website inexistence). He asked her if she is interested in him without her husband around and she give her words to prove him that she is not interested in him and he just let him rest on her but only allow him to kiss her(with a cusion next to her to block him from getting near to her). When young child finally laugh at the father who knew that the mother is having an 'affair' with the A(Her sister's boyfriend). B comes from a family where the father likes to find fault in him which lead him to be rebellious. The father of B is a very macho guy whom like to train his muscle by carrying weights. The mom, on the other hand, treat him well. C is a problematic and hot tempered youngster where he stays with his grandparents. He finally killed them because they are not letting him have his own privacy which resulted him to kill both of them with kitchen knife while they are sleeping. He was later taken away by the police. D is a female youngster, a fianc&eacute;e of a youngster's father whom his previous wife died early. The father took this woman which resembles like his dead wife with shocking and throwing huge anger when he found his fianc&eacute;e tried to have sexual relation with his kid when he visited his dead wife's grave with his son's excellent school results. He saw his fianc&eacute;e tied up his son's hand to the bed and tried to pull down his underwear and he lost his hand and quickly went over to the bed to pull the fianc&eacute;e off the son and threw her to the floor and beat up the son and bite his neck with his hand cuffed to the bed with cloth rope. He forced D to marry him later(asking her to wear his dead wife's best dress to show her beauty of her personality) and he tried to kiss and touch her but she show her face with a sense of unhappiness or facial expression of defiance. The father himself is also acting to make himself believe that this woman is still a person fill with her natural beauty. The wife in the end went out to have sexual affair with his son and B(whom also left the family because of the father's assault and also he tried to touch him and move up his hand under his trousers while he was sleeping). The story came to an end when A is together with his girlfriend in a park and follow by end credit. The eaming here is this a young kid of around six or seven years of age is watching pornographic videos with the father's thinking that she is listening to music at her free time, he is basically out of knowledge of what the family is in at the present moment and the worst part is that he is still in the dark that his wife is allowing A to get near to her and also in bed doing all those acts. He more than a blur person in the movie. On the other hand C's character was not taken care of which resulted from him become a 'hood' which resulted him to kill his own grandparents that he stay with during their sleeping time. D's character is obviously a dangerous case where he is daring enough to have sex with his father's well loved fianc&eacute;e which may result in his own death if the father uses full force of beating on him. He is also another 'bad' kid for taking his father's love one out and invite another friend, a problematic kid B to have sex with his wife. He is basically doing a disservice and make his father lose face by asking a friend to sleep with his wife (ex-wife died early). These are some of the life issues that could be easily happened in the society and this film is being made from this. I hope this recommendation is useful for letting interested parties decide what they want and what they are looking for and at the same time improve the sale of this title.

827701,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B000298WFE,Arcadio Bolaos,"[2, 4]","""Ken Park"" is firmly inserted in Larry Clark's narrative universe. From the uncouth reality of teenage boys and girls inKidsto the more visceral and shocking take on youngsters inBully, Clark has never let go of youth, whether as an immanent symbolism of life at its fullest or as the paradoxical demonstration that even life at its most intense peak can be removed at once.""Ken Park"" provides the viewer with a glimpse, only a brief instant, of a handful of characters that interact with each other and their parents. Relationships throughout the movie follow very closely the actantial model established by literary critic Greimas. There's always an actant, someone who necessarily carries out an action so that a story, any given story, can actually progress. According to Greimas, characters are neither the embodiment of psychological concepts, nor extensions of the author's mind. Characters are simply entities that act, that carry out an action which makes possible the existence of a story. In his narrative model, an opponent is essential. No action can be performed completely without something that opposes to it.Most of the opposition in ""Ken Park"" comes from the dichotomy produced between parents and children. When the teenage characters are alone they coexist in an ideal harmony, but when they face an adult problems ensue. Shawn, for example, transfers his Oedipus complex into another mother's womb, namely the mother of his girlfriend, thus engaging into an illusory Oedipal infraction while at the same time establishing himself as the bridge that will join mother and daughter in a symbolic incest. Peaches obeys what Lacan defined as inter-subjective desire, she reenacts the mother's presence by filling her void through a fantasy that nurtures her father, she is there to fill a void, to replace the dead mother symbolically while maintaining her other identity, that of the modest, sweet and virginal daughter; it's only when she fails in masquerading as an immaculate virgin that balance is disrupted and thus the father retains only the fantasy of the mother and wants, incestuous and literally, to marry her after beating her boyfriend to a pulp. Claude's situation is a bit more complicated: his father is a rampaging homophobic and after getting drunk as usual he steps into Claude's bed and attempts to take pleasure from his own son's body. Tate is an ""acting out"" case taken to the extreme, he seems incapable of expressing his sexuality through normal channels and he eventually snaps and savagely attacks his grandparents, id est, his parental figures.The movie clearly shows the failure of the preeminent heterosexual model in every instance. As Michele Foucault explains, the heterosexual drive was part of the industrialization movement in 19th century Europe, a healthy sexuality implied the capacity to procreate healthy children and nothing else mattered. The Victorian age specialized in forbidding and punishing masturbation or non-heterosexual practices; these were, after all, a blatant threat to progress. However, in the 21st century the heterosexual couple which has only procreation as a goal is no longer functional. If this kind of couple is only the ""means to an end"" then it's no surprise to see them falling apart. That, perhaps, explains Ken Park's decision at the beginning of the movie.

The basic premise is easy enough : suburbia is not always the clean respectable place it seems. Underneath the normalcy there lies a world of secrets and terror worse than our greatest nightmares. People are trapped in this world and the only way out may be extreme.Ken Park focuses on several teenagers and their tormented home lives. Shawn( James Bullard) seems to be the most conventional except for the monor fact that he's sleeping with his girlfriend's mother (Maeve Quinlan). Tate (James Ransone) is brimming with psychotic rage and living with his grandparents in a powderkeg on the verge of exploding; Claude (Stephen Jasso) is habitually harassed by his brutish father for his skating lifestyle and coddled, rather uncomfortably, by his enormously pregnant mother(Amanda Plummer). Peaches(Tiffany Limos) looks after her devoutly religious father, but yearns for freedom. They're all rather tight, or so they claim. But they spend precious little time together and none of them seems to know much about one another's family lives. This bizarre dichotomy underscores their alienation as the result of suburban ennui, a teenager's inherent sense of melodrama, and the disturbing nature of their home environments.Clark doesnt shy away from difficult subject matter but sometimes he gets extreme. This film has been banned in many countries for its frank and disturbing sexuality even though the portrayal is far from erotic. While this is not a film that many will enjoy it does have much to recommend it. Most of its critics fail to view the film for its story and focus rather on the nudity involved. That said I find much to recommend this effort even though it is rather difficult viewing.",3,Extreme but Worthwhile,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,1769,"['Larry', 'Clark', 'Ken', 'Park', 'probably', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'basic', 'premise', 'easy', 'enough', 'suburbia', 'not', 'always', 'clean', 'respectable', 'place', 'normalcy', 'world', 'secrets', 'terror', 'worse', 'greatest', 'nightmares', 'People', 'are', 'trapped', 'world', 'only', 'way', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'extreme.Ken', 'Park', 'several', 'teenagers', 'tormented', 'home', 'lives', 'Shawn', 'James', 'Bullard', 'be', 'most', 'conventional', 'monor', 'fact', 'sleeping', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'Maeve', 'Quinlan', 'Tate', 'James', 'Ransone', 'brimming', 'psychotic', 'rage', 'living', 'grandparents', 'powderkeg', 'verge', 'exploding', 'Claude', 'Stephen', 'Jasso', 'habitually', 'harassed', 'brutish', 'father', 'skating', 'lifestyle', 'coddled', 'rather', 'uncomfortably', 'enormously', 'pregnant', 'mother', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'Peaches', 'Tiffany', 'Limos', 'devoutly', 'religious', 'father', 'yearns', 'freedom', ""'re"", 'rather', 'tight', 'so', 'claim', 'spend', 'precious', 'little', 'time', 'together', 'none', 'know', 'much', 'one', 'family', 'bizarre', 'dichotomy', 'alienation', 'result', 'suburban', 'ennui', 'teenager', 'inherent', 'sense', 'melodrama', 'disturbing', 'nature', 'home', 'environments.Clark', 'doesnt', 'shy', 'away', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'sometimes', 'extreme', 'film', 'been', 'banned', 'many', 'countries', 'frank', 'disturbing', 'sexuality', 'even', 'portrayal', 'far', 'erotic', 'not', 'film', 'many', 'will', 'enjoy', 'have', 'much', 'recommend', 'Most', 'critics', 'fail', 'view', 'film', 'story', 'focus', 'rather', 'nudity', 'involved', 'said', 'find', 'much', 'recommend', 'effort', 'even', 'rather', 'difficult', 'viewing']",N/A

I have seen Kidz & Bully. This is yet another foray into the world of teen angst. As in all Larry Clark's films, he seems to portray teens with absolutely no direction that invariably does not end well. In Kidz. you had a selfish teen who only thought of his own desires and inevitably passed on AIDs. In Bully, which was actually based on a true incident in Florida, it ended up with murder of a not so nice teen. The teens portrayed in Ken Park, were not the creme of the crop by far, but yet another group of dysfunctional teens. They had absolutely no direction and lived for the moment. The oral sex in this movie is explicit as are some other scenes of fondling. If you are looking to be entertained, there is nothing entertaining about this movie. There is nothing ludicrous about the scenes portrayed in this film. They are just plain ugly as is real life in some situations.I gave it 4 stars primarily because of the film quality and production quality, as well as story. This thing will only appeal to those fans of Larry Clark as I don't think anyone else will like it. He has never been shy with his direction and this is no exception.

It's honestly a story about adolescence in dysfunctional families when Suburbia gets a closer look into. Personally, I don't see the purpose of the realness of the sex scenes period, or for all the constant nudity. For someone who actually watched it just to see what all the controversy was, I could say it caught my attention & I wanted to know what happened next to its characters but I didn't think the level of sexuality in this film was necessary to prove its point which made me not really enjoy it all that much. The story itself was played so believable to real life & scenarios that could have been real that I gasped & clapped a few times with laughter. A lot of it is brutally honest, just plain cunning to society's view on what should be acceptable to movies. Yet I respect the way that it truly did play out as if it was genuinely trying to be like life itself. This easily could have been a real story told in my opinion. You meet these people in class sitting next to you, you chill with them on occasion, & they were all your friends on facebook. Period. Everyone has stories to tell once people are gone. This movie shows the causalities that teenagers can have towards tragic experiences when all you are is a name, a word in somebody else's mouth.This movie doesn't have much depth or try to create a positive message. This movie practically shows by example that no one really respects life or takes things so seriously. Sometimes even the most normal scenarios like living with your Grandparents can turn into trouble if the guy happens to be a lunatic. Yeah, to put it straight up one of the cast member's is an f-ing psycho. & The Dad scene when he snuck up in his room made me nervous. Basically, it's like vulgarity without a purpose but to make its viewers uneasy & push the envelope to say you did it. Well great job Larry Clark, you awed me. Yet I prefer something that's a bit more meaningful than just relatable like smoking pot in a smoke circle to some hip-hop. I mean, I like it because it's possible to be an actually every day experience but at the same time, you expect a bit more of a storyline along with it. Yet I didn't really sense one all that much.Sadly all I interpreted this movie to symbolize is the corruption of our youth & the casualty we have towards death & the lack of value we honestly have towards life & all its normal privileges like having a relationship has opposed to cheating with your girlfriend's mother. Or actually appreciating the things Grandma does instead of shoving her out of the room the minute she offers fruit. Yet we do things like this. We push the ones we love away like reflexes. They hurt other people like death though & that's just life.

It is neither art, nor is about child abuse because for a variety of reason which include the fact that some of the teens in the movie are as violent as their repugnant parents. Also the movie so poorly addresses this topic there are no counselor/police officer like characters who give any sort of direction to the kids period that really that sort of lame excuse some people have given to the film really fall short. All the movie amounts to is underage porn; There's  sex being delivered by one teen in graphic fashion, the next scene has her fornicating with her two deadbeat teen friends, culminating with one nasty scene into which a teen (...) on camera!!! Yeah now you can see then any sort of feasible lie some users have given to the movie don't pan out.If you want some sort of plot basically it deals with several dysfunctional teens (the Asian girl who is catholic is the only normal person in the film along with the murdered grandparents) and the chaos they inflict on others along with their equally sick parents.I heard a lot about the movie but really being familiar with Larry Clark other explicitly violent and sexual repugnant movies I already knew what to expect and I got it, though he would surprised me if he filmed this with any sort of objective point. As I watched the movie, he confirmed he had no real viewpoint, he just filmed a series of violent, trashy scenes together and called it ""Ken Park"". LolThe one ugly kid who murders his decent grandparent is utterly vile and useless, I kept waiting for him to die, which he did, but his character is way too long to endure. Then Larry Clark, the sick old pervert that he is, tries to pull a ""Nekromantik"" making this loser (...) while he kills himself. Pretty pathetic.Like a car crash though I imagine that's what draws viewers in, it's not a good movie By any standards, but by freak circus show, trailer trash standards, ""Ken Park"" is a masterpiece!!! There is one other normal kid in the film, but he too is almost violated by his gay abusive dadI don't know what really goes on in Larry Clark's head, all his movies are the same trash, putting minors in sexual explicit situations while he as the directors gets of making them get of. I guess you can call this the Michael Jackson complex, where some sicko vicariously tries to live through being sexual with kids.The whole movie is really a joke, and the joke in on the director who filmed it and anyone else who regards this as a great film.It is popular with some teens, I guess they sort of like the rebellion that takes place in the film which I can relate to but really the nature of some of these teens and parents are really nothing to emulate.On a scale of 1-10 Ken Park, gets a very low 3 out 10 and that's being generous.",1,Pure unadulterated trash.,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,2946,"['spoilers', 'follow', 'Really', 'other', 'words', 'seem', 'describe', 'Ken', 'Park', 'man', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'pointless', 'bad', 'reality', 'show', 'others', 'users', 'have', 'said', 'art', 'child', 'abuse', 'variety', 'reason', 'include', 'fact', 'teens', 'movie', 'are', 'as', 'violent', 'repugnant', 'parents', 'Also', 'movie', 'so', 'poorly', 'topic', 'are', 'counselor/police', 'officer', 'characters', 'who', 'give', 'sort', 'direction', 'kids', 'period', 'really', 'sort', 'lame', 'people', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'really', 'fall', 'short', 'movie', 'amounts', 'underage', 'porn', 'sex', 'being', 'delivered', 'one', 'teen', 'graphic', 'fashion', 'next', 'scene', 'fornicating', 'two', 'deadbeat', 'teen', 'friends', 'culminating', 'one', 'nasty', 'scene', 'teen', 'camera', 'Yeah', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'then', 'sort', 'feasible', 'users', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out.If', 'want', 'sort', 'plot', 'several', 'dysfunctional', 'teens', 'Asian', 'girl', 'who', 'catholic', 'only', 'normal', 'person', 'film', 'murdered', 'grandparents', 'chaos', 'inflict', 'others', 'equally', 'sick', 'parents.I', 'heard', 'lot', 'movie', 'really', 'being', 'familiar', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'other', 'explicitly', 'violent', 'sexual', 'repugnant', 'movies', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'got', 'would', 'surprised', 'filmed', 'sort', 'objective', 'point', 'watched', 'movie', 'confirmed', 'had', 'real', 'viewpoint', 'just', 'filmed', 'series', 'violent', 'trashy', 'scenes', 'together', 'called', 'Ken', 'Park', 'LolThe', 'one', 'ugly', 'kid', 'who', 'decent', 'grandparent', 'utterly', 'vile', 'useless', 'kept', 'waiting', 'die', 'did', 'character', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'endure', 'Then', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'sick', 'old', 'pervert', 'tries', 'pull', 'Nekromantik', 'making', 'loser', 'Pretty', 'car', 'crash', 'imagine', 'what', 'viewers', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'standards', 'freak', 'circus', 'show', 'trailer', 'trash', 'standards', 'Ken', 'Park', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'other', 'normal', 'kid', 'film', 'too', 'almost', 'violated', 'gay', 'abusive', 'dadI', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'head', 'movies', 'are', 'same', 'trash', 'putting', 'minors', 'sexual', 'explicit', 'situations', 'directors', 'making', 'get', 'guess', 'can', 'call', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'complex', 'where', 'sicko', 'vicariously', 'live', 'being', 'sexual', 'kids.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'really', 'joke', 'joke', 'director', 'who', 'filmed', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'regards', 'great', 'film.It', 'popular', 'teens', 'guess', 'sort', 'rebellion', 'place', 'film', 'can', 'relate', 'really', 'nature', 'teens', 'parents', 'are', 'really', 'nothing', 'emulate.On', 'scale', '1-10', 'Ken', 'Park', 'very', 'low', '3', '10', 'being', 'generous']",N/A

Probably the best-worded review I've read for ""Ken Park"" so far is on IMDB.COM.  I think someone named ""peedur"" wrote it or something.  Not that I agree with him 100%, but the good that can be taken out of this film is well expressed in his critique.Look, FCC and MPAA, you don't want me to see something, then for Chrissake don't ban it.  That just makes me want to watch it even more.  In all honesty, I don't know if this film should be banned here in America.  ""Kids"" and ""Bully"" made it through okay, even into theaters.  When it comes to teens and sexuality, ""Ken Park"" might be Clark's most truthful presentation of it.  Now I know that's gonna send many parents tearing their hair out, and screaming, ""What can I do?  How can I save them from this?""  Well... you can't.If you don't want to believe that any of what happens in ""Ken Park"" is real, then you'd better just not watch it altogether.  Parents, the heartbreaking truth is that almost all of what happens in here has happened several times and will continue to happen unabated.  I've never lived in Visalia, CA, but have spent ample time there.  However, I was born and spent the first 19 years of my life in Fresno (the two are remarkably similar and close geographically).  Same stagnant lifestyle, same tendency to listen to punk and hip-hop, same heat, etc.I appreciate Clark's effort to humanize these kids this time; none of them are what I would call ""bad.""  ""Kids"" made kids look bad.  ""Ken Park"" makes kids look bored, which is what they really are.  Don't scream to the heavens, asking why they would think to do such things, that's nonsense.  Why do they smoke dope, drink ad nauseum, jerk off and have frivolous sex...?  Because there - is - nothing - else - to - do - there.  Gotta alleviate the boredom somehow.  For instance, when the devout Father scorns his daughter with the Bible... referring to her as a beast and a whore...  nope, she just a teenager.  All teenagers are beasts and whores because YOU can't think of any other label for it.Did I personally have sex with supple young teenage Filipino girls in their parents' Catholicism-adorned house?  Actually, right in the parents' bed.  I was only 17 at the time.  I've challenged my father to a fight, I've gotten impatient with grandparents for taking too long a turn playing a game, I've sat around that living room watching MTV while hitting the bong and bitching about how I couldn't wait to leave the wretched town.  I've done it; it happens.Never jerked off to womens' tennis while asphyxiating myself with a robe belt, but...It's areas like these that Clark starts to lose me.  There is much more male nudity in ""Ken Park"" than female, so don't be expecting some wild teenaged orgy.  There is not even that much actual sex in the movie.  In fact, if the main characters in this film were but... 4 years older... I guarantee you this would not be banned here in America.Visalia has - NEVER - looked as good as it does in ""Ken Park"" and never will again.  It is photographed and directed by two ace DPs after all, so the screen composition, lighting and shading are all luminous and... for lack of a better adjective: warm.  As in hospitable.  The film looks more expensive than it is.My favorite scenes are actually the opening scene and the VERY final scene.  Without these strong bookends, I'd easily knock off another half-star.  I personally detest Harmony Korine (the kid is just a pretentious skater prick that thinks he's Tarantino to the 12th power), however I do like this script... because it's ripped right out of the headlines.Parents, this is not every teenager.  It's really not.  But it is a lot of them.  ""Ken Park"" does not seek to illuminate the teenaged psyche en masse, but to offer examples of what we think is tragic and squalid... to be rather mundane existence.  With the rather few exceptions of ""shock for shock's sake"" scenes, it deserves more credit than it's been given.  Clark's best film is still ""Bully"", but ""Ken Park"" has its merits.Only for those with less discriminating tastes, obviously.  Tread lightly, but if you like your cinema to ignore boundaries (a la Miike Takashi) this one'll send you past the envelope.3.5 stars, but I'll round up for audacity.",4,W-H-I-P-L-A-S-H,1120780800,"07 8, 2005",2005,4290,"['Folks', 'movie', 'alright', 'not', 'THAT', 'BAD', 'Probably', 'best-worded', 'review', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Ken', 'Park', 'so', 'far', 'IMDB.COM', 'think', 'someone', 'named', 'peedur', 'wrote', 'something', 'Not', 'agree', '100', '%', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'film', 'well', 'expressed', 'critique.Look', 'FCC', 'MPAA', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'something', 'then', 'Chrissake', 'do', ""n't"", 'ban', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'even', 'more', 'honesty', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'banned', 'here', 'America', 'Kids', 'Bully', 'made', 'okay', 'even', 'theaters', 'When', 'teens', 'sexuality', 'Ken', 'Park', 'might', 'be', 'Clark', 'most', 'truthful', 'presentation', 'Now', 'know', 'gon', 'send', 'many', 'parents', 'tearing', 'hair', 'screaming', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'How', 'can', 'save', 'Well', ""can't.If"", 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'what', 'Ken', 'Park', 'real', 'then', ""'d"", 'better', 'just', 'not', 'watch', 'altogether', 'Parents', 'heartbreaking', 'truth', 'almost', 'what', 'here', 'happened', 'several', 'times', 'will', 'continue', 'happen', 'unabated', ""'ve"", 'never', 'lived', 'Visalia', 'CA', 'have', 'spent', 'ample', 'time', 'there', 'However', 'was', 'born', 'spent', 'first', '19', 'years', 'life', 'Fresno', 'two', 'are', 'remarkably', 'similar', 'close', 'geographically', 'Same', 'stagnant', 'lifestyle', 'same', 'tendency', 'listen', 'punk', 'hip-hop', 'same', 'heat', 'etc.I', 'appreciate', 'Clark', 'effort', 'humanize', 'kids', 'time', 'none', 'are', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'bad', 'Kids', 'made', 'kids', 'look', 'bad', 'Ken', 'Park', 'kids', 'look', 'bored', 'what', 'really', 'are', 'Do', ""n't"", 'scream', 'heavens', 'asking', 'why', 'would', 'think', 'do', 'such', 'things', 'nonsense', 'Why', 'do', 'smoke', 'dope', 'drink', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'jerk', 'off', 'have', 'frivolous', 'sex', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'there', 'Got', 'ta', 'alleviate', 'boredom', 'somehow', 'instance', 'when', 'devout', 'Father', 'daughter', 'Bible', 'referring', 'beast', 'whore', 'nope', 'just', 'teenager', 'teenagers', 'are', 'beasts', 'whores', 'YOU', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'label', 'it.Did', 'personally', 'have', 'sex', 'supple', 'young', 'teenage', 'Filipino', 'girls', 'parents', 'Catholicism-adorned', 'house', 'Actually', 'right', 'parents', 'bed', 'was', 'only', '17', 'time', ""'ve"", 'challenged', 'father', 'fight', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'impatient', 'grandparents', 'taking', 'too', 'long', 'turn', 'playing', 'game', ""'ve"", 'sat', 'living', 'room', 'watching', 'MTV', 'hitting', 'bong', 'bitching', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'leave', 'wretched', 'town', ""'ve"", 'done', 'happens.Never', 'jerked', 'womens', 'tennis', 'asphyxiating', 'robe', 'belt', 'areas', 'Clark', 'lose', 'much', 'more', 'male', 'nudity', 'Ken', 'Park', 'female', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'wild', 'teenaged', 'orgy', 'not', 'even', 'much', 'actual', 'sex', 'movie', 'fact', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'were', '4', 'years', 'older', 'guarantee', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'banned', 'here', 'America.Visalia', 'NEVER', 'looked', 'as', 'good', 'Ken', 'Park', 'never', 'will', 'again', 'photographed', 'directed', 'two', 'ace', 'DPs', 'screen', 'composition', 'lighting', 'shading', 'are', 'luminous', 'lack', 'better', 'adjective', 'warm', 'hospitable', 'film', 'more', 'expensive', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'opening', 'scene', 'VERY', 'final', 'scene', 'strong', 'bookends', ""'d"", 'easily', 'knock', 'off', 'half-star', 'personally', 'detest', 'Harmony', 'Korine', 'kid', 'just', 'pretentious', 'skater', 'prick', 'Tarantino', '12th', 'power', 'however', 'do', 'script', 'ripped', 'right', 'headlines.Parents', 'not', 'teenager', 'really', 'not', 'lot', 'Ken', 'Park', 'not', 'seek', 'illuminate', 'teenaged', 'psyche', 'en', 'masse', 'offer', 'examples', 'what', 'think', 'tragic', 'squalid', 'be', 'rather', 'mundane', 'existence', 'rather', 'few', 'exceptions', 'shock', 'shock', 'sake', 'scenes', 'more', 'credit', 'been', 'given', 'Clark', 'best', 'film', 'still', 'Bully', 'Ken', 'Park', 'merits.Only', 'less', 'discriminating', 'tastes', 'obviously', 'Tread', 'lightly', 'like', 'cinema', 'ignore', 'boundaries', 'la', 'Miike', 'Takashi', 'one', ""'ll"", 'send', 'envelope.3.5', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'round', 'up', 'audacity']",N/A

As noted by previous reviewers, the film is about youthful alienation in a small California town.  But everybody's alienated, even the parents.  There's a personality to fit every situation, from the super religious to closeted homophobe.  The kids and the parents  are screwed up of course, and the film spends its 90 minutes attempting to illustrate this without ever letting us know how they got that way, or showing us a path out.  I guess we are supposed to assume that society made them that way, which then makes  the film a snapshot of that culture at that time, with no narrative meat on its bones.There isn't much else worthy of comment except the extensive sexual situations, which propel the plot around in a circle rather than straightforward.  The female actors are attractive and easy on the eyes.  The boys are another matter.  Each is skinny, ugly and presumably  a drug addict in real life.  There are open sexual acts, the camera doesn't flinch, but if you are looking for a hardcore skin flick the internet can give you more with much better eye candy.  The real porn is in the dialogue.  I'm sure it's accurate given the extreme sexual situations, but it's jarring nonetheless.In summary, this is a string of vignettes looking for a plot, pushed forward by the  unsympathetic characters who populate the film. If you are looking for a good Larry Clark film try Bully, a film with similar trappings as Ken Park that knows how to advance a plot toward a real and scary finale.

It was supposed to be his first film, but due to timing and availability of money, it turned out to be a few films into his impressive resume of demented tales of the young and the disillusioned.If you thought Bully was disturbing...Ken Park is playing on some other level.  Bully is a better film, more complete, a story to tell with more character development.  Ken Park is like a thing, a non-specific moment in time.  It looks like it could be the 70s, it more or less takes place today with little detail or technology to date it because that's not the point.  The point is to show some of the, er, better behavior people demonstrate behind closed doors.I don't totally know how to consider this film.  Suffice to say that Larry just doesn't pull punches.  Everyone gets naked, close to every taboo is discussed and shown, and in the end, the only thing left is for the downtrodden characters to have an orgy and find something in themselves that they can't get from their parents or the outside world.  Something like that.  The framing story is about the suicide, graphically shown, of course, of the titular Ken Park, who can't go on because...well, we only learn why in the closing scene.This film has not been able to get distribution.  About five minutes in...you'll know why.  ""Uh, Larry, I think we need to talk about distribution.""

827732,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000298WFE,OverTheMoon,"[5, 12]","If anything you can not say that the acting in this film is bad. Everybody seems to do a good job of whatever parts they have. On that front, Ken Park is quite well made and the cast is more functional that his previous efforts, but it falls a little into the same category as Todd Solondz ""Storytelling"" rather than a ""Happiness"". However, if you like this genre then you will love ""Ken Park"".Ken Park is probably Clark's most exploitive work to date. Make no doubt about it - this is exploitation material through and through. Certainly the numerous scenes involving fellat**, ejacu**tion and full screen penetr**ion should give this movie an instant X rating, which it strongly deserves if not the banning treatment in some places. Then again banning this film may be going a little too far with it, but it is not exactly as if Ken Park does not go far with things. In fact Ken Park hurls itself full force right over the edge. Ken Park does away with ""implying"" its taboo. Instead it does it bluntly. It does it all over your face.It is hard to see what exactly the market for a product like this one is. It plays mostly like a teen movie, but this is completely adult material that DOES border on child abuse (or borderline teenage abuse) but the cast seem happy enough to go along with it, which is puzzling as to why. What am I talking about? Let's get our facts straight here. This movie is considered child abuse in some places but is legal in others because of the split-hair ages involved. So Clark's film is certainly illegal material in some regions of our planet which would see the filmmaker on the offenders register with a mandatory jail sentence in no time if he had made the film there. However much like every other capitalist on the block, Clark just exploits the law in his land and exploits his subjects to sell us this type of controversial movie. It is not the first time he has done it. It probably won't be the last. In a way, Clark is selling out to this kind of material - what is legal here is not legal there and it does spin a buck.For this reason Ken Park comes across as like another ""Kids"" instalment, maybe even a sequel. You can not say that Clark is a director with much vision or scope. He is actually extremely narrow director pushing the depths of that narrowness. Just because he is a good filmmaker (in the sense that he can get his vision shot and into the can) this does not mean that he is not just a creepy old man (he is 61) who likes to film this sort of thing.Exploitation material aside Ken Park is actually extremely contrived and in parts and there is a much better movie waiting to break out from underneath all the sleaze. The story takes place in the same block and is absolutely categorically unbelievable as we have a multiple homicide, abuse, a father marrying his daughter, suicides, a mother's intimacy with on her daughter's boyfriend (check the cover of the DVD) and much more Jerry Springer mayhem all within the range of half a mile. If this is real then Clark has picked a moment in time which is like winning the lotto. Even though this film tries to get the edge on ""realism"" it is pure fantasy through and through. If the plot elements where spread out across the country then yes it is all completely plausible, but given that the characters know each other it simply flies bluntly in the face of that which it tries to be. So what is the meaning of Ken Park?Well the name of the movie comes from a kid who blew his brains out because he got his girl preggers - a taboo in society, but certainly nothing unusual, but suicide over it? Yes that is rare. Rare it is also that a father should marry his daughter - Rare for kids to kill their family - Rare for mothers to date their daughter's boyfriend and Rare that films like this one get made. Ken Park is all just manufactured taboo, given a location and place in time where it can all happen in the same arena.Ken Park is memorable only because of the explicitly shameless presented on the screen, but on the story front is half good half bad. The best scenes in this film involve a guy drinking beer and peeing at the same time, a boyfriend getting beaten up by his girlfriend religious fanatic dad, a story about a secretary pickup up pencils and a scrabble game gone wrong.Like I said, there is better movie waiting to break out underneath all the sordid details. Ken Park ultimately goes nowhere except to present a bit of exploitation masquerading as art in an attempt to show us the ""real world"" but in the end you know damn well that Clark wants to show us lots of skin, sexuality and nudity to sell his movie. Clark could tell the exact same movie and not have any need for 90% of what is on display here. If there is one word to describe Ken Park then that word is ""GRATUITOUS"" and Ken Park does that with a cherry on top. I am not sure if society is really going to moan that much if they are not allowed to see Ken Park. Okay so give Clark his plastic medal for pushing the boundaries of acceptable artistic material. If he does it again just give him a plastic trophy for being capable of selling us pornography with better acting and a story.

I can usually take movies that are extreme.  The problem is, it should be stressed that this is an EXTREMELY, EXPLICITLY UGLY movie.  Not merely explicit.  And it is very male-oriented, despite the cunning linguist shot on the cover (a scene which isn't nearly as explicit with her anatomy as you'd think - that angle hides a lot).  The female presence in the explicit scenes is minimal, in some cases nonexistent (one scene treats you to an explicit male solo while he uses a noosette).  So WARNING - unless you enjoy gay adult films, this might not be for you.I give it two stars simply for its overall style, which would be quite refreshing if it weren't filled with the most unsavory personalities and actions you could possibly dream up.  A couple of actors were also really good known characters, and it was interesting to see them in a project like this.  The shots of Californian suburbia were also really interesting, and I had hopes for that during the opening sequence.  Too bad this director doesn't have a lot of meaningful things to say, just the worst of teenage angst that those of us who lived through it already understood once we matured a little that it was nowhere near as important or any kind of revelation as we thought it was when it happened.  It's really worth little more than shock value for its own sake, which is a pretty immature way of getting attention.  But that's how kids this age often think, and that's what this movie portrays.  It never finds a way to validate the way they did things that were outside the norm.Just when you think this movie is ugly enough, a bit of male parental abuse is sprinkled in, in plenty of lingering detail.I don't like using the cliche ""I want 70 minutes of my life back"", but in this case I do.",2,"Really graphic, you may wish you could un-see, but too late",1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,1902,"['one', 'few', 'movies', 'bought', 'watching', 'purely', 'notoriety', 'unavailability', 'rental', 'was', 'mistake', 'can', 'usually', 'take', 'movies', 'are', 'extreme', 'problem', 'should', 'be', 'stressed', 'EXTREMELY', 'EXPLICITLY', 'UGLY', 'movie', 'Not', 'merely', 'explicit', 'very', 'male-oriented', 'cunning', 'linguist', 'shot', 'cover', 'scene', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'explicit', 'anatomy', ""'d"", 'think', 'lot', 'female', 'presence', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'minimal', 'cases', 'nonexistent', 'one', 'scene', 'explicit', 'male', 'solo', 'noosette', 'So', 'WARNING', 'enjoy', 'gay', 'adult', 'films', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'you.I', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'simply', 'overall', 'style', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'were', ""n't"", 'filled', 'most', 'unsavory', 'personalities', 'actions', 'could', 'possibly', 'dream', 'up', 'couple', 'actors', 'were', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'known', 'characters', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'project', 'shots', 'Californian', 'suburbia', 'were', 'also', 'really', 'interesting', 'had', 'hopes', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Too', 'bad', 'director', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'meaningful', 'things', 'say', 'just', 'worst', 'teenage', 'angst', 'who', 'lived', 'already', 'matured', 'little', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'important', 'kind', 'revelation', 'thought', 'was', 'when', 'happened', 'really', 'worth', 'little', 'more', 'shock', 'value', 'own', 'sake', 'pretty', 'immature', 'way', 'getting', 'attention', 'how', 'kids', 'age', 'often', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'never', 'way', 'validate', 'way', 'did', 'things', 'were', 'norm.Just', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'ugly', 'enough', 'bit', 'male', 'parental', 'abuse', 'sprinkled', 'plenty', 'lingering', 'detail.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'using', 'cliche', 'want', '70', 'minutes', 'life', 'back', 'case', 'do']",N/A

Allow me to address some of these issues here:Those who see Larry Clark as a pedophiliac fetishist are largely ignorant of his previous work and his motivations for filming the things that he does. It's not as simple as a 60-year-old director filming naked adolescents - Clark has been interesting in telling the story of adolescents since he was their age. It's simply that he's gotten older while his interest has stayed the same. Unfortunately for him, society has a complex structure of taboos that he appears to break at times. This does not make him an exploiter of young people. He has valid artistic reasons for showing what he does.Clark has always been about showing the unaffected reality of youth whether it's in the city (Kids), the ghetto (Wassup Rockers), or suburbia (Ken Park). Clark doesn't turn his camera away because to fide behind the conventions of film and ideas of ""morality"" is to compromise the honesty that Clark finds in his young actors. Zavattini speaks of filming the common man for the purpose of social change - Clark is operating along similar premises here.It's possible that moralists would have problems with Clark's vision if he was in his 20s, but it's more likely that these people are just using it as an easy excuse to attack frank, open sexuality on film.Ken Park is the work of an artist at the top of his game. It's brutal honesty is what is missing from Hollywood cinema today. I enjoy big budget movies as much as anyone, but it's nice to have a refreshing alternative. This film has a purpose beyond ""entertainment"" (indeed - it's not a fun, or easy film to watch), but it's a film worth watching provided you don't mind seeing some truly horrible sights.The film IS graphic and you'll see things that will stay with you for a long time, but it never crosses into exploitation. If you look at the work, its structure, and its system, you can justify everything in the film. However, that is not to say that everyone should watch this film. There's nothing wrong with not enjoying extreme content (whether visual or textual) and if that's you, I would avoid this. If you can handle it though, this is a very powerful film.Finally, there's the issue of the lack of a domestic release. The PAL DVD from Russia has decent video and sound quality. It comes with Russian subtitles, but they are removable. The only difficulty is the menu system which is in Russian. I can't speak for all sellers, but RussianDVD-Com (the seller I used) provided excellent instructions for deactivating subtitles and starting the film. Since the DVD is all-region, you can watch it in a computer or a DVD player with a PAL converter.

Some shocking scenes mixed with true-to-life teen angst and dialogue.

Clarke takes his camera into the lives of the teens whose own lives aren't exactly rosy. Shawn is having an affair with his girlfriends mother; Peaches is the surrogate wife for her widowed father who is still in mourning; Claude is having difficulty with his parents (particularly his obnoxious father), who are about to have another child, but should have instead been sterilized; and lastly there is Tate, the psycho who lives with his parents and has a passion for women's tennis. With real actors playing alongside the teens, it is difficult to watch at times due to the lack of acting talent, but the adults rounding out the cast - including the always riveting Amanda Plummer as Claude's pregnant mother - make up for it.It's explict and really hard to find - pretty much banned in the US, but I purchased my copy off eBay for $10.",3,Had to see what the hoopla was about,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1088,"['Hard', 'watch', 'times', 'due', 'unflinching', 'realism', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'Larry', 'Clarke', 'hard', 'find', 'Ken', 'Park', 'centers', 'quartet', 'dysfunctional', 'friends', 'Visalia', 'California', 'death', 'fellow', 'student', 'named', 'Ken', 'Park', 'Clarke', 'camera', 'lives', 'teens', 'own', 'lives', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'rosy', 'Shawn', 'having', 'affair', 'girlfriends', 'mother', 'Peaches', 'surrogate', 'wife', 'widowed', 'father', 'who', 'still', 'mourning', 'Claude', 'having', 'difficulty', 'parents', 'particularly', 'obnoxious', 'father', 'who', 'are', 'have', 'child', 'should', 'have', 'instead', 'been', 'sterilized', 'lastly', 'Tate', 'psycho', 'who', 'parents', 'passion', 'women', 'tennis', 'real', 'actors', 'playing', 'teens', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'due', 'lack', 'acting', 'talent', 'adults', 'rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'including', 'always', 'riveting', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'Claude', 'pregnant', 'mother', 'make', 'up', 'it.It', 'explict', 'really', 'hard', 'find', 'pretty', 'much', 'banned', 'US', 'purchased', 'copy', 'off', 'eBay', '10']",N/A
