For just like the love triangle in the opera, we are introduced to the characters who will ultimately draw us into a most spectacular but deadly summer vacation at the Italian riviera.We are introduced to two cosmopolitan, middle aged couples who are going to share a house at the beach for the summer.  On the surface it appears like they are all rock solidly loving couples, however each person holds secrets, lusts and pent up frustrations; which we slowly glimpse as the film progresses.Truly, it is melodrama on a grand scale... hidden in subtle ways through out the picture.  Constantly I was amazed at how the actors played characters whose passions are just hidden beneath the surface, bubbling and just waiting to explode.  You can draw many character parallels to  Visconte's ""Death in Venice"" though I would not go so far as to say this film is of the same calibre.  However, the lushness and the drama is there.  I was drawn in and too late did I realize that I too was on the same path as the characters, hurtling towards an cataclysmic ending.  Truly, you feel as if you are a guest at this vacation house and you are seeing what the camera observes, ala Robert Altman.It was my good fortune to see it at the Philadelphia Qfest this past summer on the big screen. Watching this film in its proper setting allows one to be swallowed into it.  You can still appreciate what the director was doing as you watch the dvd.

This may sound like a great idea if you've never seen an opera, especially a Wagner opera, but without the music you have a generally idiotic and unbelievable plot that no one would sit through.  This is sort of like that.As others have noted, they open with Tristan and Isolde, and you don't need to know anything about opera to know that this is setting up the story, because they tell you it's a tragedy in the script.  Should you miss this part, someone else gets killed along the way---not a main character---and the music that exists won't let you enjoy the film, it keeps humming and whispering, and leading you on to the Tragedy Ahead.Two italian couples rent a beach house for a summer together.  Neither marriage is working well.  David's father is a man-child who &#34;until recently&#34; we're told, used to hang out in the bathroom smoking pot, with a bunch of morons who thought farting was a prime expression of humor, so his wife took their son to New York and raised him alone, although they got together fairly regularly.  The other couple are a bit more polished, a psychologist and his wife, but still having issues.  People are having affairs.  Very european affairs, in that they just have them and argue over them without anyone whipping out the bible to out quote the other one in &#34;Who's a bigger hypocrite&#34; as we do over here.And then David shows up.  David is the sort of Italian dude that emptied the quarries at Carrara. There are statues of him around the globe, often naked (love those Italians!).  David's &#34;uncle&#34; of sorts, his dad's best friend and half of the other couple, falls in lust.  Oh, and David's real uncle, who might be Mafia, or a drug dealer, or something, also shows up and might also be in lust, but I was having trouble keeping up by this point.I cheated and googled the movie and found out who was going to die, and when, and watched the movie until I got there and bailed.As I said, it's an opera without the music.  With music it would have been quite an evening.  When (un named character) gets killed we would have heard a cymbal and tympani, operatic screams, and then, to keep people in their seats instead of hooting with derision, a fantastic aria.No such luck.It's a pretty film.  The characters are likeable and fairly real, although not terribly developed.  It could have been much more interesting had it not gotten so convoluted in its operatic leanings.  I would have worked on the dramatic element more, and let the sea resolve any characters or issues left hanging by the end of the film.  But, it wasn't my film.I don't need a happy ending, just a good one.  If you insist on giving me a melodramatic ending, it better have good music.  It doesn't.Meh.",3,Grand Opera.

1379104,ACZ6J3L2C0IZ6,B0040BJH2M,"John Cardenas ""opera nut""","[1, 3]","The reviewer who referenced 1940s cinema was not far off the mark here.  The Tristan und Isolde music sweeping in now and then signifying the lovers' waxing passion reminded me of that old Joan Crawford movie where she drowns herself to the strains of the Liebestod.  Humoresque?  It also reminded me of those Ava Gardner movies, ""Pandora and the Flying Dutchman"" and ""The Barefoot Contessa,"" memorably described by Pauline Kael as nutty-fruity, meaning more feeling for visuals and sensuality went into them than common sense.  If this had been made by Almodovar, there would probably be more campy fun about juxtaposing all this high culture with brazen lust, but as it is the director and cast seem to want us to take it straightfaced, tragically even.  The Tristan myth ends with the destruction of the lovers, but here things end up somewhat differently (without giving it away), which I think somewhat detracts from the myth's potency.  I think this may be related to what seemed to me to be the main problem with this movie--it seems to be two movies in one.  One deals with the gritty, kitchensink marital problems of two aging couples struggling to live with and understand one another, seen before in a number of Italian films.  The other is, of course, the overpowering, purple passion between (mostly) the somewhat doughy Massimo and the eponymous David.  When these two strains--the fantastical and the all-too-real--come crashing together at the end, it's somewhat disconcerting, and I think stylistically and thematically irreconcilable.All that said, in some respects the film is highly entertaining--Wagner's music for one.  It's so rare to see a film with opera, let alone classical, threaded in so innately with the material, so if even one wants to giggle a bit at the overripeness of it all, it is, nevertheless, still satisfying on some level.  The second major reason is the painterly eye candy on display--and I don't just mean David (the sublimely horse-handsome, Thyago Alves, here dubbed--one reviewer stated he looked like he had just stepped out of a Botticelli painting, which is not far off the mark).  Maria de Madeiros is such a delicate presence with such an atypical, ethereal beauty--her head is a horizontal oblong with large eyes, a prominent nose, and a caressing, sensitive voice--a nonnative speaker of Italian, she speaks it charmingly.  If David looks like an Italian Renaissance stud, at his most beautiful as he emerges like Venus from the ocean at one point, dripping with water and eyes intoxicatingly lit from within as he drinks of the love potion with the besotted Matteo, de Medeiros looks like one of Picasso's female obsessions--a more exaggerated yet strangely inward modern beauty, especially in one brief moment where she's caught staring off pensively into space.  One feels her destruction would truly be a tragedy for all concerned.",3,a little silly but not without its merits,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,2891,"['reviewer', 'who', 'referenced', '1940s', 'cinema', 'was', 'not', 'far', 'mark', 'here', 'Tristan', 'und', 'Isolde', 'music', 'sweeping', 'now', 'then', 'signifying', 'lovers', 'waxing', 'passion', 'reminded', 'old', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'movie', 'where', 'strains', 'Liebestod', 'Humoresque', 'also', 'reminded', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'movies', 'Pandora', 'Flying', 'Dutchman', 'Barefoot', 'Contessa', 'memorably', 'described', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'nutty-fruity', 'meaning', 'more', 'feeling', 'visuals', 'sensuality', 'went', 'common', 'sense', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'Almodovar', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'campy', 'fun', 'juxtaposing', 'high', 'culture', 'brazen', 'lust', 'director', 'cast', 'seem', 'want', 'take', 'straightfaced', 'tragically', 'even', 'Tristan', 'myth', 'destruction', 'lovers', 'here', 'things', 'end', 'up', 'somewhat', 'differently', 'giving', 'away', 'think', 'somewhat', 'myth', 'potency', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'related', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'be', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'One', 'deals', 'gritty', 'kitchensink', 'marital', 'problems', 'two', 'aging', 'couples', 'struggling', 'live', 'understand', 'one', 'seen', 'number', 'Italian', 'films', 'other', 'course', 'overpowering', 'purple', 'passion', 'mostly', 'somewhat', 'doughy', 'Massimo', 'eponymous', 'David', 'When', 'two', 'strains', 'fantastical', 'all-too-real', 'come', 'crashing', 'together', 'end', 'somewhat', 'disconcerting', 'think', 'stylistically', 'thematically', 'irreconcilable.All', 'said', 'respects', 'film', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'Wagner', 'music', 'one', 'so', 'rare', 'see', 'film', 'opera', 'let', 'alone', 'classical', 'threaded', 'so', 'innately', 'material', 'even', 'one', 'giggle', 'bit', 'overripeness', 'nevertheless', 'still', 'satisfying', 'level', 'second', 'major', 'reason', 'painterly', 'eye', 'candy', 'display', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'David', 'sublimely', 'horse-handsome', 'Thyago', 'Alves', 'here', 'dubbed', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'looked', 'had', 'just', 'stepped', 'Botticelli', 'painting', 'not', 'far', 'mark', 'Maria', 'Madeiros', 'such', 'delicate', 'presence', 'atypical', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'head', 'horizontal', 'oblong', 'large', 'eyes', 'prominent', 'nose', 'caressing', 'sensitive', 'voice', 'nonnative', 'speaker', 'Italian', 'charmingly', 'David', 'Italian', 'Renaissance', 'stud', 'most', 'beautiful', 'Venus', 'ocean', 'one', 'point', 'dripping', 'water', 'eyes', 'intoxicatingly', 'lit', 'love', 'potion', 'besotted', 'Matteo', 'de', 'Medeiros', 'one', 'Picasso', 'female', 'obsessions', 'more', 'exaggerated', 'yet', 'strangely', 'inward', 'modern', 'beauty', 'especially', 'one', 'brief', 'moment', 'where', 'caught', 'staring', 'off', 'pensively', 'space', 'One', 'destruction', 'would', 'truly', 'be', 'tragedy', 'concerned']",N/A

(But, what did you expect.....it's Italian)What we have here is a lush surroundings showcase for one very ""hot bod"".....in the form of title character, David (tall, dark, first-timer, Thyago Alves).  And as the one bedeviled and bedazzled by this youthful sex god, we're given family man, Matteo (Massimo Poggio), a psychiatrist by trade, and a man who much of the first two-thirds of the film goes out of its way to show as being scholarly but, even more so, soulful.This is a production much like the then well known 1950s era, Douglas Sirk directed, lush and weepy melodramas (see ""Magnificent Obsession"" or ""All That Heaven Allows"").  For a more current approach to this genre, see the Todd Haynes written/directed work, and Dennis Quaid's one foray into homosexuality:  ""Far From Heaven"" (2002).""David's Birthday"" is also what I refer to as a ""fadeaway movie,"" meaning it's something more usually seen from the 1940s through '70s.  You know how those went; when anything sexual might begin to transpire, there was always a quick fadeaway to the next scene.  For examples of that in this film, consider the following:  Putting yourself into the position of a young and gorgeous Calvin Klein-type underwear model (David), you take this still hunky, but older, married man (Matteo) for a Vespa scooter ride.....his unhelmeted head winds up resting softly against your back, his arms clasped tightly around your body.  And then nothing further happens for days.......UNTIL a night on the beach, when this young Adonis emerges from a moonlit swim and approaches his walking-on-the-beach ""enraptured soul"".....both of them then standing together for at least a minute, staring in one another's eyes.

Not only does it establish the theme of love the movie will explore, but it also sets the ground rules for the film's tone:  melodrama.  When looked at this way, it's easy to accept the film and many of the performances on those terms, particularly Poggio as Matteo.  His story is mostly well-told, and it's a familiar character study and emotional territory for anyone who's seen a few gay films--it's worthy of exploration and doesn't seem overdone here.It should be noted there is a lot of subtlety in the film to keep it from becoming an over-the-top mess.  The relationships among the adults is generally handled with a light touch, such as the others' frustration with Matteo's intellectual pretentiousness.The faults I find with the movie are the seemingly stray subplots.  Why is Leonard in the film?  Is he there only to serve a warning to Matteo, albeit an underdeveloped warning?  What about Giuliana?  While the revelation of the truth behind her lies is informative of her character, the implication for Matteo's journey isn't apparent.  Likewise, Francesca's breakdown on the beach.  We don't really learn why her reaction to the (unknown) drowned girl is so strong.  Finally, what kind of relationship does David have with Leonard?  Is it more than friend/fun uncle/surrogate father?  The look the two share near the end may imply something, but it's unclear.

Uh, not this movie. There was rather more on the filmmaker's mind. We get tipped-off to grand passion run amok when the movie opens watching the opera Tristan and Isolde--a tad confusing because I thought this flick was supposed to be at a summerhouse by the sea . . . at which we eventually do arrive to find the crew from the box at the opera: an unconventional couple (they appear to live on different continents) and their best friends, a shrink w/ his neurasthenic wife. Oh, yeah, and while we were at the opera, the un-wife spotted her tortured brother whom we much later learned helped his clinically depressed girlfriend check out after a couple of suicide attempts. But I get ahead of myself. The couples gather at the villa on the beach (these folks seem to have molto money, btw) and await the arrival of the un-couple's son, whom they had when they were very young and then quasi-separated. The son is the eponymous David whose birthday is immanent and whose drop-dead (literally, I'm afraid, but that also comes much later) gorgeous face and body appear to draw everybody's sexuality issues right to the surface. So, no, not fun in the summertime, and instead we are served an emotional tangle more convolute than a Bergman film. The Wagner at the beginning did signal that the going was going to get rough. This might easily have degenerated into daytime TV sudsy nonsense, but the actors were all compellingly believable, as indeed was the intensity of their passion. This, HOWEVER, IS NO GBLT movie.

Both couples have a faade of being happily married, but obviously have pasts. Diego (Alessandro Gassman) has a son from a previous hitch up to Shary. He is the David who is going to have a birthday as promised in the title.Whilst they fall into a rhythm of care free meals, games on the beach and lots of al fresco dining, he suddenly turns up after being away in New York for five years. He is part time student, model and head turner David (Thyago Alves). He wastes absolutely no time in getting the Speedos out to pose languidly on the beach, Surf board, any piece of given furniture. He immediately causes a stir amongst the local flibbertigibbets and a lot more besides.One person who seems obsessively drawn is the happily married Matteo ( Massimo Poggio). He is a self made man, who loves his wife, daughter and job. He is a psychoanalyst and has to keep taking time out to treat his patients, one of whom is a daughter hating, woman, who seems to be treating him as much as he is treating her by her outpouring of non maternal revulsion.This is a very stylish and well directed film, the musical score is both empathetic and emotional in equal measure. It actually opens at a performance of `Tristen and Isolde', and those themes of love and loss run like a vein throughout the film.  There is also an elusive brother Leonard, who is still grieving the loss of his wife and seems to know more than he is admitting to. Past emotions are never too far from the surface and as copious amounts of wine are added to the mix, things are going to happen.As the heat of summer rises, so does the passion and emotions get ramped up to bursting point the closer we get to the actual birthday. No one is left untouched by the events that follow. It is in Italian and a bit of English, with good sub titles and a run time of just over 100 minutes. This is a highly polished, well acted and crafted film. Whilst homosexuality or at least desire/lust are central themes, also is the one of honesty and in being true to your self you are, in turn, being true to others. I very much enjoyed this film and can highly recommend to fans of quality European cinema.",4,"""There are some roads you can't turn back on""",1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,2327,"['Italian', 'film', 'director', 'Marco', 'Filberti', 'tale', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'decide', 'hire', 'beautiful', 'house', 'Italian', 'coast', 'whole', 'month', 'summer', 'holidays', 'couples', 'have', 'faade', 'being', 'happily', 'married', 'obviously', 'have', 'pasts', 'Diego', 'Alessandro', 'Gassman', 'son', 'previous', 'hitch', 'up', 'Shary', 'David', 'who', 'going', 'have', 'birthday', 'promised', 'title.Whilst', 'fall', 'rhythm', 'care', 'free', 'meals', 'games', 'beach', 'lots', 'al', 'fresco', 'dining', 'suddenly', 'up', 'being', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'five', 'years', 'part', 'time', 'student', 'model', 'head', 'turner', 'David', 'Thyago', 'Alves', 'absolutely', 'time', 'getting', 'Speedos', 'pose', 'languidly', 'beach', 'Surf', 'board', 'piece', 'given', 'furniture', 'immediately', 'stir', 'local', 'flibbertigibbets', 'lot', 'more', 'besides.One', 'person', 'who', 'obsessively', 'drawn', 'happily', 'married', 'Matteo', 'Massimo', 'Poggio', 'self', 'made', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'daughter', 'job', 'psychoanalyst', 'keep', 'taking', 'time', 'treat', 'patients', 'one', 'whom', 'daughter', 'hating', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'treating', 'as', 'much', 'treating', 'outpouring', 'non', 'maternal', 'revulsion.This', 'very', 'stylish', 'well', 'directed', 'film', 'musical', 'score', 'empathetic', 'emotional', 'equal', 'measure', 'actually', 'performance', 'Tristen', 'Isolde', 'themes', 'love', 'loss', 'run', 'vein', 'film', 'also', 'elusive', 'brother', 'Leonard', 'who', 'still', 'grieving', 'loss', 'wife', 'know', 'more', 'admitting', 'Past', 'emotions', 'are', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'surface', 'copious', 'amounts', 'wine', 'are', 'added', 'mix', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'happen.As', 'heat', 'summer', 'rises', 'so', 'passion', 'emotions', 'get', 'ramped', 'up', 'bursting', 'point', 'closer', 'get', 'actual', 'birthday', 'one', 'left', 'untouched', 'events', 'follow', 'Italian', 'bit', 'English', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'run', 'time', 'just', '100', 'minutes', 'highly', 'polished', 'well', 'acted', 'crafted', 'film', 'Whilst', 'homosexuality', 'least', 'desire/lust', 'are', 'central', 'themes', 'also', 'one', 'honesty', 'being', 'true', 'self', 'are', 'turn', 'being', 'true', 'others', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'quality', 'European', 'cinema']",N/A
