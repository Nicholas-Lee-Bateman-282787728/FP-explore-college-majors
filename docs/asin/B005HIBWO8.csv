I rate it 5 stars. This updated movie, we all agreed, was poorly done. Jonny is now a year older (12) and there is the addition of Race's daughter (by Jade). I would not mind the additional character if said character was added to show their own strength, weaknesses and real team work instead of as a ""politically correct"" member who is there to show and remind the viewers that Jonny has now become a total dis-obedient hot-head. Jonny in the series would want to strike out on his own (with Hadji) but he was not so disrespectful and obtuse. Further the animation is sub-par compared to the original show. We all gave this movie one star; thankfully, we only checked it out from our local library.",1,Not on par with the great original series...,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,817,"['twins', 'boy', 'girl', 'love', 'original', 'Jonny', 'Quest', 'series', 'just', 'did', 'kid', 'bought', 'series', 'DVD', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'updated', 'movie', 'agreed', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'Jonny', 'now', 'year', 'older', '12', 'addition', 'Race', 'daughter', 'Jade', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'additional', 'character', 'said', 'character', 'was', 'added', 'show', 'own', 'strength', 'weaknesses', 'real', 'team', 'work', 'instead', 'politically', 'correct', 'member', 'who', 'there', 'show', 'remind', 'viewers', 'Jonny', 'now', 'become', 'total', 'dis-obedient', 'hot-head', 'Jonny', 'series', 'would', 'want', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'Hadji', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'disrespectful', 'obtuse', 'animation', 'sub-par', 'compared', 'original', 'show', 'gave', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'thankfully', 'only', 'checked', 'out', 'local', 'library']",Jonny Quest Vs.

It was like a action packed program that a kid could watch, but adults could watch without feeling like they are being tortured with cutesy non-sense.This story is kind of in between ""Jonny Quest"" (1964) and ""The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest"" (1996), as the children are younger than in the newer series. The characters don't always get along. The boys are irritated that this GIRL has to tag along with them, but as in the new series, Race Bannon's daughter can take care of herself!As with the old series, this story is a good story... a combination of ""Aliens"" (1986), and ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977).I am glad it is finally on DVD, as my VHS is not happy!",4,The Quest team is back!,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,902,"['exception', 'subtle', 'bigotry', 'original', 'series', 'non-whites', 'are', 'lacking', 'intelligence', 'are', 'back-stabbers', 'was', 'excellent', 'One', 'few', 'cartoons', 'people', 'die', 'often', 'killed', 'heroes', 'was', 'action', 'packed', 'program', 'kid', 'could', 'watch', 'adults', 'could', 'watch', 'feeling', 'are', 'being', 'tortured', 'cutesy', 'non-sense.This', 'story', 'kind', 'Jonny', 'Quest', '1964', 'Real', 'Adventures', 'Jonny', 'Quest', '1996', 'children', 'are', 'younger', 'newer', 'series', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'along', 'boys', 'are', 'irritated', 'GIRL', 'tag', 'along', 'new', 'series', 'Race', 'Bannon', 'daughter', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'old', 'series', 'story', 'good', 'story', 'combination', 'Aliens', '1986', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'IV', 'New', 'Hope', '1977', '.I', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'not', 'happy']",Jonny Quest Vs.

This is mainly due to the subject matter..being insects, you have to like looking at gigantic bugs as this movie is teeming with them. The plot was more complex than anticipated and well explained throughout the story, with a few twists and surprises. If you have seen other Johnny Quest eps or movies, and don't mind insects, and like me have to see ALL the Johny stuff as I really enjoy it..indulge. A decent watch for what it is, but don't expect to like it if you hate creepy crawlies.",4,Best for seasoned Jonny fans,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,587,"['entertaining', 'adventure', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'better', 'already', 'familiar', 'Johnny', 'Quest', 'mainly', 'due', 'subject', 'matter..being', 'insects', 'have', 'like', 'looking', 'gigantic', 'bugs', 'movie', 'teeming', 'plot', 'was', 'more', 'complex', 'anticipated', 'well', 'explained', 'story', 'few', 'twists', 'surprises', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'Johnny', 'Quest', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'insects', 'have', 'see', 'Johny', 'stuff', 'really', 'enjoy', 'it..indulge', 'decent', 'watch', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'hate', 'creepy', 'crawlies']",Jonny Quest Vs.

I read the comics and I was excited for this DVD because this movie was on TV when I was growing up. I remember taping it with a vhs and watching it over and over again. It's an old classic and I enjoyed it very much. They only thing that kinda bothered me was the DVD quality. I've noticed this has been an issue from the company as of late. I wish they'd take more consideration in making something of quality. It's basically just a burned DVD with a few printed out labels thrown on it. The DVD doesn't offer any extras either, which I think are fun to watch.
