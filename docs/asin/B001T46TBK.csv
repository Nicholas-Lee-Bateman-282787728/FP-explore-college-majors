Complications ensue when a third party gets involved. A times comic and at the end, extremely dark, this Danish thriller hits all the marks and leaves you satisfied. I haven't enjoyed a recent foreign film this much in a long time. Catch this.",5,"Wow!

His life takes another turn when he causes a car accident that leaves a woman a mysterious stranger. Feeling that he owes the woman and her family a debt of gratitude, he plays her abusive boyfriend Sebastian. He has fooled Julia's family into thinking that he is the one for her. They are unaware of who he is, or that of her real boyfriend. Jonas impresses her family immediately because of his affection for their daughter. All the while, his relationship with his wife slowly disintegrates.Just Another Love Story, although a psychological thriller, illustrates what is seen isn't always real. There are dark patches that humans fail to examine until tragedy strikes. For Julia, it took a loss of vision to know had been gone what needed to be restored. Jonas was trying to put the pieces of her puzzle together but at a cost to his marriage and work. He, too, failed to see that what he was doing would hurt Julia's family. Just Another Love Story keeps the viewer at the edge of one's seat to see what happens next and keeps them guessing.",5,Just Another Twisted Tale,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,1131,"['Jonas', 'photographer', 'who', 'snapshots', 'corpse', 'married', 'father', 'two', 'life', 'turn', 'when', 'car', 'accident', 'woman', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'Feeling', 'woman', 'family', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'Sebastian', 'fooled', 'Julia', 'family', 'thinking', 'one', 'are', 'unaware', 'who', 'real', 'boyfriend', 'Jonas', 'family', 'immediately', 'affection', 'daughter', 'while', 'relationship', 'wife', 'slowly', 'Love', 'Story', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'what', 'seen', ""n't"", 'always', 'real', 'are', 'dark', 'patches', 'humans', 'fail', 'examine', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'Julia', 'took', 'loss', 'vision', 'know', 'had', 'been', 'gone', 'what', 'needed', 'be', 'restored', 'Jonas', 'was', 'trying', 'put', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'together', 'cost', 'marriage', 'work', 'too', 'failed', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'would', 'hurt', 'Julia', 'family', 'Just', 'Love', 'Story', 'viewer', 'edge', 'one', 'seat', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'guessing']",Just Another Love Story

1235587,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B001T46TBK,Margaux Paschke,"[3, 4]","This movie is Danish with english subtitles.  I enjoyed this mesmerizing film noir from start to finish and highly recommend this movie if you enjoy suspenseful thrillers and don't mind subtitles.The movie started with three tantalizing glimpses of love and then moves into the movie itself, just another love story...  The brilliance of this set-up is revealed later in the movie.  This movie is full of artful touches and beautifully filmed scenes that make it a great find.  I also found it to be an unsettling combination of sadness and suspense.The story revolves around a middle aged man who appears happily married but upon meeting a young woman, whose current hospital bed ridden state he feels partly responsible for, starts to question his 2.5 kids & white picket fence existence.  The rich young woman suffers from amnesia and he temporarily assumes her boyfriend's persona. But things get out of control fast and as he is sucked deeper and deeper into the young woman's mysterious life, his own life begins to crumble around him.

1235590,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B001T46TBK,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[12, 12]","The filming, the score, the performances - all make for a great film that I find difficult to fully explain. A sordid tale of love, deception, betrayal, and above all: amnesia. Or maybe it is all about temporary madness, temporary passion and telling the truth. The Amazon description tells it best without revealing too much. There are so many twists and plot turns, that I thought it would become unbelievable, but they kept writing this piece in ways to make it beautiful, fun, terrifying and altogether enjoyable.An unknown cast (here in America) fills all the requirements to keep this Danish thriller alive, but especially that of supporting player Dejan Cukic, he had a great screen presence as the police officer/best buddy. What struck me as most memorable though, was the filming and quality of effects. The crash sequence towards the beginning rivals any non-cgi event I have seen.The story follows a married CSI-type police employee as he ventures into the realm of an amnesia stricken woman with a mysterious background. Through the course of events, both sensual and saddening at the same time, everyone's lives that are touched by the main character's faulty decisions, begin to unravel and feel the consequences.This is bare bones DVD, but the sound and picture quality are good. The DVD cover art shows way too much of the final scenes, but in fairness they do show the ending of the film as the opening salvo of love stories. If it were rated it would be R for nudity, sexual content, language and violence.",5,"Improbable love stories, impeccably told",1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,1525,"['filming', 'score', 'performances', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'find', 'difficult', 'fully', 'explain', 'sordid', 'tale', 'love', 'deception', 'betrayal', 'amnesia', 'maybe', 'temporary', 'madness', 'temporary', 'passion', 'telling', 'truth', 'Amazon', 'description', 'best', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'plot', 'turns', 'thought', 'would', 'become', 'unbelievable', 'kept', 'writing', 'piece', 'ways', 'make', 'beautiful', 'fun', 'terrifying', 'altogether', 'enjoyable.An', 'unknown', 'cast', 'here', 'America', 'requirements', 'keep', 'Danish', 'thriller', 'alive', 'especially', 'supporting', 'player', 'Dejan', 'Cukic', 'had', 'great', 'screen', 'presence', 'police', 'officer/best', 'buddy', 'What', 'struck', 'most', 'memorable', 'was', 'filming', 'quality', 'effects', 'crash', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'non-cgi', 'event', 'have', 'seen.The', 'story', 'married', 'CSI-type', 'police', 'employee', 'ventures', 'realm', 'amnesia', 'stricken', 'woman', 'mysterious', 'background', 'course', 'events', 'sensual', 'saddening', 'same', 'time', 'everyone', 'lives', 'are', 'touched', 'main', 'character', 'faulty', 'decisions', 'begin', 'unravel', 'feel', 'consequences.This', 'bare', 'bones', 'DVD', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'good', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'final', 'scenes', 'fairness', 'do', 'show', 'ending', 'film', 'opening', 'salvo', 'love', 'stories', 'were', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'R', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'content', 'language', 'violence']",Just Another Love Story
