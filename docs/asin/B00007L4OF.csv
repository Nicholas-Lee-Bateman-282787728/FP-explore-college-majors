731369,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00007L4OF,A Customer,"[10, 13]","Summary:The movie is based upon the life of Winston Churchill (Albert Finney).  It begins just as information about the German re-armament is beginning to seep into British political life.  Winston is an aging statesman that is losing his political clout.  When his insights into the impending German military conquest are reinforced by hard data given to him secretly by Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache), Winston's perspective takes parliament by storm, resulting in the resignation of the Prime Minister and the eventual appointment of Winston as Prime Minister.However, the primary story is only half of what makes this movie superb. The other half is the remarkable portrayal of the relationship between Winston and his wife, Clemmie (Vanessa Redgrave).  Perhaps what really drives the relationship in the movie is when Clemmie, who has sacrificed so much of her life and been so selfless for so many years in support of her husband's career, finally decides to take a trip alone, leaving Winston without the support he has counted on for so many years.My Comments:This movie is remarkably well-done.  I didn't even recognize Albert Finney (from Erin Brockovich); I couldn't place him and was stunned when I saw his name in the credits.  I felt kind of foolish afterward.  In retrospect it's pretty obvious, but I sure had a difficult time of it he was so convincing.  All of the actors did a superb job; I can't even begin to complain about any of the portrayals.As noted above, the love story is very touching.  What makes it even more touching is that Winston Churchill is not idealized or romanticized in anyway - he had a very strong personality and likely was very difficult to live with.  However, if this movie is even a remotely accurate portrayal of the relationship he had with his wife, he loved two things very deeply (other than himself of course), his wife and his country, and both of these loves are very explicitly conveyed in the movie, but in a convincing way.  (I do wonder if 'Pug' was a real petname for him...)In the end you find yourself falling in love with Winston Churchill, despite his arrogance and his overbearing personality; he believed in something and was willing to fight tenaciously for it.  When the movie ends you feel like you've been in the presence of a great man.  Now, I'm not one to revere people; but occasionally you do meet people that are just, well, amazing.  I've only met one other person that I could compare to Winston Churchill, but you wouldn't know him so I won't get into it.  Anyway, I would have followed Mr. Churchill and I don't throw my allegiances around lightly.Overall, the movie is both touching and powerful.  It introduces you to both the husband and statesman of Winston Churchill, as well as his backside (you get to see Albert Finney's butt in the very opening scene, not that that should be an attraction, 'butt' anyway...).  The movie isn't showy; it's very straightforward, has a very specific agenda, and sticks with its main character.  It is very well done and teaches history at the same time.  I would highly recommend it.",4,Remarkable!,1055203200,"06 10, 2003",2003,3101,"['Summary', 'movie', 'based', 'life', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'just', 'information', 'German', 're-armament', 'beginning', 'seep', 'British', 'political', 'life', 'Winston', 'aging', 'statesman', 'losing', 'political', 'clout', 'When', 'insights', 'impending', 'German', 'military', 'conquest', 'are', 'reinforced', 'hard', 'data', 'given', 'secretly', 'Ralph', 'Wigram', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'Winston', 'perspective', 'parliament', 'storm', 'resulting', 'resignation', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'eventual', 'appointment', 'Winston', 'Prime', 'Minister.However', 'primary', 'story', 'only', 'half', 'what', 'movie', 'superb', 'other', 'half', 'remarkable', 'portrayal', 'relationship', 'Winston', 'wife', 'Clemmie', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'really', 'relationship', 'movie', 'when', 'Clemmie', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'been', 'so', 'selfless', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'support', 'husband', 'career', 'finally', 'take', 'trip', 'alone', 'leaving', 'Winston', 'support', 'counted', 'so', 'many', 'years.My', 'Comments', 'movie', 'remarkably', 'well-done', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'could', ""n't"", 'place', 'was', 'stunned', 'when', 'saw', 'name', 'credits', 'felt', 'kind', 'foolish', 'afterward', 'retrospect', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'sure', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'actors', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'complain', 'portrayals.As', 'noted', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'touching', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'touching', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'not', 'idealized', 'romanticized', 'anyway', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'personality', 'likely', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'live', 'However', 'movie', 'even', 'remotely', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'relationship', 'had', 'wife', 'loved', 'two', 'things', 'very', 'deeply', 'other', 'course', 'wife', 'country', 'loves', 'are', 'very', 'explicitly', 'conveyed', 'movie', 'convincing', 'way', 'do', 'wonder', ""'Pug"", 'was', 'real', 'petname', 'end', 'find', 'falling', 'love', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'arrogance', 'overbearing', 'personality', 'believed', 'something', 'was', 'willing', 'fight', 'tenaciously', 'When', 'movie', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'presence', 'great', 'man', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'revere', 'people', 'occasionally', 'do', 'meet', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'well', 'amazing', ""'ve"", 'only', 'met', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'could', 'compare', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Anyway', 'would', 'have', 'followed', 'Mr.', 'Churchill', 'do', ""n't"", 'throw', 'allegiances', 'lightly.Overall', 'movie', 'touching', 'powerful', 'both', 'husband', 'statesman', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'as', 'well', 'backside', 'get', 'see', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'butt', 'very', 'opening', 'scene', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'attraction', 'anyway', 'movie', ""n't"", 'showy', 'very', 'straightforward', 'very', 'specific', 'agenda', 'sticks', 'main', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'teaches', 'history', 'same', 'time', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Gathering Storm

731372,A2XFA2HIIKS5G2,B00007L4OF,Bentley,"[3, 3]","The Wall Street Journal stated: ""So satisfying, so superb, so rich on so many levels.""  I cannot agree more.  The Gathering Storm was a winner of three emmys (outstanding movie, lead actor (Albert Finney) and for writing).  On every level, it was exceptional.  The tension and the quality of the relationship between the Churchills was captured so well in the chemistry that was shown in the acting of Finney and Redgrave.  Some have said that Finney was more Churchill than Churchill.What I loved about this film was the study of Winston as the family man, the husband, the father, the friend, the boss, the writer, the painter, the statesmen.  Churchill was all of these things but what struck me most about this work was that we discovered the man with his deep emotions, self doubts and moods.Jim Broadbent was super as Desmond Morton who was a British military officer and government official. He played a role in organizing a response to appeasement of German under Hitler during the period prior to World War II. He with Ralph Wigram provided intelligence information about German re-armament to Winston Churchill when Churchill was out of power. Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940 and he made Morton his  Personal Assistant.  They had been extremely close friends.  Ralph Wigram was played by Linus Roche and he was a British official in the Foreign Office.  In the work of Churchill (Second World War) Churchill called him one of the greatest unsung heroes;  in fact he was much more than that; Wigram was tormented in his role of passing information to Churchill in order to gain the attention of Baldwin and others who had other appeasement and free trade agreements on their mind versus preparing England for what was to come unfortunately.Stanley Baldwin was played aptly by Derek Jacobi and Wigram's superior Sir Robert Vansittart was played solidly by Tom Wilkerson.  We hear so much about the statesman and about his role of prime minister but we seldom get such a personal view of the man and his love of Chartwell and his great admiration by his staff and family.  All of this was captured on film with this work.It is hard to believe that prior to World War II that so many in England had stuck their head in the sand.  Despite the rumors and stories about what was happening to the Jewish people and about  German sterilization plans etc., 90% of the English people still believed in international disarmament.  It could very well have been that families were so upset with the first world war that the young boys who were born during that great war were now old enough to fight in this one; it is certain that the people wanted to avoid a war at all costs and this was admirable in them and in their Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin.  But at the very least, thanks to quite a few brave men including Wigram; the awareness level was raised soon enough before it was too late.There is a wonderful audio discussion with the producer and writer discussing various background aspects of some of the major scenes which was wonderful; but what I liked best was the superb acting performed by everyone and this last quote by Churchill about the performance of the English people could easily have been said about every contributor and actor in this great film.""In our long History, We have never seen, A greater day than this.

He is devoted to his wife so this is no womanizer.  However, he is beset by crippling depression periodically throughout his life and has to paint as a result.  He also can have a monumental ego, be offputting and offensive.  Balance this with the fact that he is totally right about Germany in World War II though, one of the few people who sees Hitler clearly.  Incredibly, others in the government want to try pacifying tactics with Hitler, like give him a country here or there and hope that satisfies him!

731378,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00007L4OF,Craig MACKINNON,"[6, 6]","Albert Finney does a remarkable thing starring in this film as Winston Churchill.  With no more than the proper wardrobe and a Romeo and Juliet cigar, he transforms himself into everyone's vision of the legendary stateman.  He well deserved the Emmy for best performance, and may well have won the Oscar had this been a theatrical release.  The entire cast is top-notch: I especially liked seeing Sir Derek Jacobi as Baldwin, and Vanessa Redgrave is a pleasure as usual.  In addition, the cinematography is fantastic - the production values rival any Hollywood theatrical release.  HBO is rightfully becoming the leader in drama.The plot loosely follows the details of Churchill's political life (and that of Britain's) in the '30's.  I especially liked the portrayal early in the film of Churchill defending the crackdown on Gandhi and against Indian independence.  At that time, Churchill was a solution in search of a problem, and he basically lashed out at anything that altered the status quo or affected the Empire.  But when Hitler came to power, and Germany started re-arming, Churchill came to life.  He was the most vocal of Britain's appeasement critics and started arming himself for the battle he knew was coming.  This was Churchill at his best - a lone voice crying in the wilderness, but with a message that wouldn't go away and one that more and more people started listening to.  The film ends with the declaration of war in September '39 and Churchill's appointment to cabinet (as First Lord of the Admiralty).However, the plot is incidental.  This film is mostly a portrait of Churchill the man.  We see him ranting in the House of Commons, lambasting his staff, tyranising his family, and coercing staff at the foreign office into giving him access to restricted material.  This is the Churchill everyone knows, and it's nothing new.  What this film adds is Churchill barking (literally - like a dog) at him wife, playing with his youngest daughter, and absentmindedly forgetting to wear clothes in the presence of his secretaries.

A surprising amount of time is dedicated to the tragic side story of Ralph Wigram that not nearly enough time is paid to the other historical figures and events.  I wish the film had been at least 2 hours, perhaps then the full story could have been fleshed out a bit more.As it stands, Wintson shares the stage with Wigram in a rather brief sketch.

What Mr. Burns and company have done for documentaries, HBO has done for docudramas - that is bring dramatic life to our history and make it relevant to today.  Many of the major events which occured in both Europe and the Pacific prior to the official outbreak of World War Two were largely ignored both in the United States and England.  While the Axis powers, (Germany, Japan and Italy,) embraced expansionist policies through much of the 1930s, the rest of the world countered with isolation and appeasement.  Drawn from the first volume of Sir Winston Churchill's now famous historic overview of the war years, the HBO production bearing the same name, ""The Gathering Storm"" tells the story of how a once powerful man, (Sir Winston - masterfully portrayed by the great Albert Finney,) finds his way back to leadership in order to help prepare his England, (and by example a fair amount of the rest of the world,) to withstand the imminent diaster we now know as the Second World War.

I thought Robert Hardy's portrayal of Churchill in ""The Wilderness Years,"" some 20 years ago, could not be topped.  Albert Finney has proved me wrong as his is as good if not better.  Of course, the storyline is frustratingly similar.  The premise is that over 90% of the British public are opposed to war with Germany in the 1930's.  Many actually sympathize with the Germans for what was seen as unfair terms of the Versailles Treaty.British political leaders pander to the mood of pacifism with one exception:  Winston Churchill.  Churchill stands alone in his concerns for the Nazi war machine as it is built up in the mid-30's.  British pacifists adopt a program of appeasing Hitler and his Nazi gangs with the inevitable result.

731392,A2BSZPRBKYAB2K,B00007L4OF,"Joe Owen ""Joe""","[0, 0]","The Gathering Storm is a movie about Sir Winston Churchill that takes place on the eve of World War II.  Albert Finney does an excellent job of playing Sir Winston as he is trying to warn Great Britain about the growing menace of NAZI Germany and Adolf Hitler.  Vanessa Redgrave also does an excellent job as Churchill's wife Clementine.  You see Finney as Churchill warning a skeptical Parliament that Hitler is violating the terms of the Versailles Treaty by re-arming the German military either outright or ""undercover"".  There are those who are loyal to Winston Churchill and give him the military intelligence covertly by getting the files from the Foreign Office.  In the movie you see Winston Churchill in all his moods.  He could be childish, profane, loud, egotistical, degrading, and very stubborn.  But on the other hand Churchill was humble, kind, reassuring, confident, and brave.  Albert Finney shows all these moods of Sir Winston very convincingly.  Clementine Churchill portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave was a loving and devoted wife, that thoroughly supported her husband, however she didn't tolerate his bad behavior either.  She was truly his rock of confidence when it mattered most.  THis movie has a great plot of the events that led up to World War II.  Colin Firth does a great acting job portraying a Parliament member who opposes Winston Chruchill.  As the movie goes on, you see that Parliament is starting to believe in Churchill's warning and along the way you see Churchill's rise in Parliament and finally as Prime Minister.  The locations and sets in the movie are outstanding, especially Churchill's country estate on the southwest English shore.This is a companion to ""Into The Storm"" starring Brendan Gleeson as Winston Churchill during the war years and after World War II.

He was a walking ""how to"" manual on how to making shortcomings look a part of why one was able to be even moreso or better than originally declared in the age old question, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?""This movie THE GATHERING STORM shows the homebody Winston and his relationship with the love of his life Clemetine and the way he was perceived in the eyes of each who knew and grew up around him during his days as a speaker of Parliment to his being assigned the Prime Ministership of Britian. Each child's perception is different as well as the perception of Winston's relationship with Clemmie as she was called. The chemistry between ol' ""Pug and Pussycat"" is something that can't be denied throughout the movie.The movie shows Winston as human and vulnerable as anyone else living and breathing on his planet which quite possibly hadn't been shown that much for the wide and TV screens. You'll laugh, cheer, wonder, and shed a poignant tear for this unlikely man whose stances were not always embraced by the majority and not only stood by them but he knew how to take the vocalized gestures of doubt and disbelief and turn them into the very fire that inspired him to keep going. He took the arias of doubt and disbelief and he used them to fuel his drive to find out more documented and irrefuted sources of information that would either support their opinion AND how to work around it OR he would take those shards of information and he would make them realize, ""This is why I felt that this is the way we should be going on this and I have in my hands the proof that my way is the only way the way I feel we should be looking at this situation MY way is the only way to do so."" Then again, he doesn't really raise his voice. He doesn't call his fellow Members of Parliament dirty names nor does he cuss in any of his pleas and speeches.

THE GATHERING STORM depicts the period from 1934 to 1939. It's no exaggeration to say that Churchill owes the resurgence of his political career to Adolph Hitler and the Third Reich.Albert Finney was an inspired choice in the title roll. We watch as Winston, despondent over his fall from influence, becomes the lone voice in the wilderness speaking out against the government's policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany. This is all the more remarkable because it was Churchill's own party, the Conservatives, which held power under Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi), who, as pointedly put by Winston, was but an &quot;epileptic corpse&quot;. However, this film does not slavishly idolize. We see Churchill for what he also was: inept at money handling, domineering, occasionally incredibly selfish, and perhaps too envious of the military accomplishments of his ancestor, the 1st Duke of Marlborough. And, as comic relief, the viewer is led to believe that Winston composed and rehearsed his greatest speeches in the loo, especially while in the bathtub.THE GATHERING STORM is also a tribute to Clementine Churchill (Vanessa Redgrave), who scores major points for staying married to a difficult man. In one instance, after twenty-some years of selfless devotion to her marriage and family, Clementine defies her husband's self-centeredness and goes off on a Pacific jolly to chase Komodo Dragons, a large lizard. You go, girl!This isn't a riveting drama by any means, but it's an extremely competent portrayal of the man and his times. For one already acquainted with Churchill's career, it offers nothing new. For one who knows nothing of Churchill or that period of Britain's history between the wars, it's perhaps a must-see. Much of it was filmed at Churchill's home of the time, Chartwell, now a National Trust property.The very best thing about Finney's portrayal is his voice. I could close my eyes and easily imagine that it was Winston himself speaking. However, this aspect of the production also leads to its greatest failing, which is that not enough of Churchill's great oratory was heard. As I watched the ending credits roll, I thought how they needed a voice-over of Winston's greatest speech - the one that even now brings chills to me (a non-Brit), and which includes:&quot;Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire and Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest hour.&quot;",4,Catching the first zephyrs of war out of the doldrums,1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,2752,"['part', 'Churchill', 'legend', 'having', 'served', 'high', 'government', 'posts', 'first', 'third', '20th', 'century', 'Winston', 'was', 'has-been', 'mid-1930s', 'ridiculed', 'avoided', 'fellow', 'members', 'Parliament', 'caught', 'political', 'doldrums', 'GATHERING', 'STORM', 'period', '1934', '1939', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'Churchill', 'resurgence', 'political', 'career', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'Third', 'Reich.Albert', 'Finney', 'was', 'inspired', 'choice', 'title', 'roll', 'watch', 'Winston', 'despondent', 'fall', 'influence', 'lone', 'voice', 'wilderness', 'speaking', 'out', 'government', 'policy', 'appeasement', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'more', 'remarkable', 'was', 'Churchill', 'own', 'party', 'Conservatives', 'held', 'power', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Stanley', 'Baldwin', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'who', 'pointedly', 'put', 'Winston', 'was', 'quot', 'epileptic', 'corpse', 'quot', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'slavishly', 'idolize', 'see', 'Churchill', 'what', 'also', 'was', 'inept', 'money', 'handling', 'domineering', 'occasionally', 'incredibly', 'selfish', 'perhaps', 'too', 'envious', 'military', 'accomplishments', 'ancestor', '1st', 'Duke', 'Marlborough', 'comic', 'relief', 'viewer', 'led', 'believe', 'Winston', 'composed', 'rehearsed', 'greatest', 'speeches', 'loo', 'especially', 'bathtub.THE', 'GATHERING', 'STORM', 'also', 'tribute', 'Clementine', 'Churchill', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'major', 'points', 'staying', 'married', 'difficult', 'man', 'one', 'instance', 'twenty-some', 'years', 'selfless', 'devotion', 'marriage', 'family', 'Clementine', 'husband', 'self-centeredness', 'off', 'Pacific', 'jolly', 'chase', 'Komodo', 'Dragons', 'large', 'lizard', 'go', 'girl', ""n't"", 'riveting', 'drama', 'means', 'extremely', 'competent', 'portrayal', 'man', 'times', 'one', 'already', 'acquainted', 'Churchill', 'career', 'nothing', 'new', 'one', 'who', 'nothing', 'Churchill', 'period', 'Britain', 'history', 'wars', 'perhaps', 'must-see', 'Much', 'was', 'filmed', 'Churchill', 'home', 'time', 'Chartwell', 'now', 'National', 'Trust', 'property.The', 'very', 'best', 'thing', 'Finney', 'portrayal', 'voice', 'could', 'close', 'eyes', 'easily', 'imagine', 'was', 'Winston', 'speaking', 'However', 'aspect', 'production', 'also', 'greatest', 'failing', 'not', 'enough', 'Churchill', 'great', 'oratory', 'was', 'heard', 'watched', 'ending', 'credits', 'roll', 'thought', 'how', 'needed', 'voice-over', 'Winston', 'greatest', 'speech', 'one', 'even', 'now', 'chills', 'non-Brit', 'quot', 'Let', 'therefore', 'brace', 'duties', 'so', 'bear', 'ourselves', 'British', 'Empire', 'Commonwealth', 'last', 'thousand', 'years', 'men', 'will', 'still', 'say', 'was', 'finest', 'hour.', 'quot']",The Gathering Storm

Reynolds,"[7, 10]","This is a fairly good reflection of William Manchester's &quot;Alone,&quot; the second (and, unfortunately, final) volume of his Churchill bio series.  Winston's daily life was represented fairly well -- rising late, sleeping blindfolded, traipsing around in his robe, being attended by servants, throwing little fits over personal details.  I would have liked to have seen more information surrounding the meals hosted (or rather, conducted) at Chartwell, when guests would dine lavishly through the evening and listen to Churchill opine or, sometimes, debate and discuss.  These exercises, anointed with alcohol to lesser or sometimes greater degree, fueled Winson's all-night writing sessions that ensued after guests departed.Additional portrayal of those writing habits also would have been interesting.  At one point in the film, Winston railed that he was working 20 hours per day to keep the family afloat (he had no ability whatever for money management), but it was not clear that Winston's writing was bearing the brunt of that support, that the family lived from magazine article to newspaper editorial to book, scraping by.  Churchill accordingly had to write like a maniac, which gave rise to what most would consider maltreatment of servants (we do see him admonish his manservant at one point, &quot;But I am a GREAT man!&quot; -- which indeed did occur, and which indeed Churchill was).  It is obvious in the film that the servants don't take umbrage to this treatment, perhaps understanding that they are an integral part of a historically significant phenomenon and literary giant.Additionally, more exposure to Winston's House of Commons speeches would have been interesting.  We did see (on just one occasion) that he carefully choreographed his chambers speeches (&quot;pause for effect, look of doom&quot; etc), but we were not treated to very much of that oratory.  Finney did a grand job portraying it (including the intermittent, slight lisp).  Why was there not more?Manchester's books were sometimes overly detailed; this film was sometimes overly sparse.

If there were a dozen people who changed the world from 1900 to 2000, he would be one of them.His words about freedom - 'we will fight them on the beaches, in the streets, we will never give up' and gratitude to the brave Spitfire pilots who stopped Hitler's expansion at the English Channel - 'never has so much been owed by so many to so few,' still haunt us today.Yet he was a tyrant who ruled his home and family with as much self absorption and self centeredness as he did his political life.This film shows all of it and could well be followed by the subsequent chapters in the dozen years that changed our lives. Albert Finney is great, Vanessa Redgrave equal to the task, and the others, Wilkenson, Jacobi, Broadbent, Roache et al. also brilliant.Should not be missed.

Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave become Winston and Clementine Churchill in this understated film depicting the final years before the explosion that was WWII. No histrionics here.Winston is experiencing a lull in his career, which bothers him deeply. What bothers him more is the blindness of his fellow MPs in the face of blatant German aggression. Clementine, meanwhile, wants to set out on an adventure of her own, after a lifetime spent supporting her husband's  political ambitions and rearing her children.Finney becomes Churchill here. If his head and face were rounder, you'd swear it was Winnie himself. What makes The Gathering Storm more than a political piece is the story of his marriage.

I wish to address only the lack of a rating for those parents and others who would like a little more info. in this area. The film would likely garner a -PG- rating for two incidents.First: is Churchill's bare bum in the opening scenes.  It is not offensive, but it is fully present.  It is not presented in a lewd or crass way.Second:  is the use of the ""F"" word roughly 2/3 of the way through.  Churchill and another man are walking down a beautiful country lane among the fall colored leaves.  Churchill recites a translation of a Russian (he thinks) poem in which the ""F"" word is part of one line.  It is said quickly and may possibly be missed if one is not paying attention.  Finney's thick Churchillian voice occasionally makes words hard to understand.There are many scenes showing parts of Churchill in the bath and dressing.  He also ""makes water"" a few times but we are fortunate only to hear the evidence.  These are not offensive scenes, just very ""male"".This is an excellent film.  It is hard to believe it is an HBO production instead of a full-on theatre release.  The quality of this production is very high.  The story portrays Churchill's inspirational tenacity, strong belief in his destiny, and love of country.  The film boasts a first rate cast and terrific props and costuming.

With this very undignified beginning, we enter into the world of Winston Churchill in the days leading up to WWII. This is more than just about the political climate in England, it is the personal side of Churchill as well. It is about his life-long love relationship with his wife, Clementine as well as his life on his estate where he is struggling financially when the film opens and Clementine must step in to take over the finances to stay solvent. Much of the filming takes place on the actual estate which is amazing in itself. Of course, the focus of the film is the political world and Churchill's attempt to warn Great Britain and the world about the looming threat from Hitler and the Nazis. His is a lonely voice, at first. He had a true sense of destiny for his life and role in saving England. He had help, too, from inside the foreign affairs office, that would provide him confidential information about Hitler and his activities. It would be hard to imagine anyone playing Churchill better and more convincing than Finney. Redgrave is outstanding as well and is no minor character in his life or in the film. This is a film that deserves a much broader distribution than it has had. Really, a very brilliant picture of Churchill and the events leading up to WWII.

He was searching a ""cause"" to regain political prestige. The British Empire was subject to enormous pressure: India was rebelling and claming for freedom leaded by Mahatma Gandhi; in Germany Hitler has sized power and started his path to war and conquest; in Far East Japan has launched his assault to China; the whole World was still trying to recover from the Great Depression. British Government was involved in appeasement politic that will lead to weakness and close its eyes to most of these dangers.The present film scrutinizes these critical years in Churchill's life with a keen sight. None of his weak spots are left out: his problems with his son and daughters; his almost financial default; his struggle with depression (""the black dog"" in his own words); his semi despotic character and his heavy drinking.Nevertheless his mighty personality and magnetism allows him to start his crusade against Herr Hitler. He stresses himself and all his entourage into the near impossible mission of awakening the country to the mortal danger that is growing in Europe.This film has deservedly earned three BAFTA awards and three more nominations.Albert Finney's characterization of Churchill is really amazing; he has captured the spirit a demeanor of this great leader and put forward a great performance.Vanessa Redgrave is perfect as Clemmie Churchill showing her play acting class without overdoing a bit. The marital disagreement scene that both actors perform is just perfect!Linus Roache and Lena Headey as the Wigram couple are very good too.Director Richard Loncraine has delivered a very good telefilm as he has done the previous year with the second chapter of ""Band of Brothers"".Howard Goodall has composed a great musical score (he was one of the nominated for a BAFTA award).Cinematography in charge of Peter Hannan shows London neatly and autumn English landscape beautifully.This is a great telefilm for all public.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,The Roaring Lion is back!,1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,2173,"['Gathering', 'Storm', 'outstanding', 'historical', 'reconstruction', 'movie', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'life', 'darkest', 'moment', 'two', 'World', 'Wars.The', 'Lion', 'was', 'wounded', 'discredited', 'due', 'party', 'shifts', 'was', 'searching', 'cause', 'regain', 'political', 'prestige', 'British', 'Empire', 'was', 'subject', 'enormous', 'pressure', 'India', 'was', 'rebelling', 'claming', 'freedom', 'leaded', 'Mahatma', 'Gandhi', 'Germany', 'Hitler', 'sized', 'power', 'started', 'path', 'war', 'conquest', 'Far', 'East', 'Japan', 'launched', 'assault', 'China', 'whole', 'World', 'was', 'still', 'trying', 'recover', 'Great', 'Depression', 'British', 'Government', 'was', 'involved', 'appeasement', 'politic', 'will', 'lead', 'weakness', 'close', 'eyes', 'most', 'dangers.The', 'present', 'film', 'critical', 'years', 'Churchill', 'life', 'keen', 'sight', 'None', 'weak', 'spots', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'problems', 'son', 'daughters', 'almost', 'financial', 'default', 'struggle', 'depression', 'black', 'dog', 'own', 'words', 'semi', 'despotic', 'character', 'heavy', 'drinking.Nevertheless', 'mighty', 'personality', 'magnetism', 'start', 'crusade', 'Herr', 'Hitler', 'entourage', 'near', 'impossible', 'mission', 'awakening', 'country', 'mortal', 'danger', 'growing', 'Europe.This', 'film', 'deservedly', 'earned', 'three', 'BAFTA', 'awards', 'three', 'more', 'nominations.Albert', 'Finney', 'characterization', 'Churchill', 'really', 'amazing', 'captured', 'spirit', 'demeanor', 'great', 'leader', 'put', 'forward', 'great', 'performance.Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'perfect', 'Clemmie', 'Churchill', 'showing', 'play', 'acting', 'class', 'overdoing', 'bit', 'marital', 'disagreement', 'scene', 'actors', 'perform', 'just', 'perfect', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'Wigram', 'couple', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'too.Director', 'Richard', 'Loncraine', 'delivered', 'very', 'good', 'telefilm', 'done', 'previous', 'year', 'second', 'chapter', 'Band', 'Brothers', '.Howard', 'Goodall', 'composed', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'one', 'nominated', 'BAFTA', 'award', '.Cinematography', 'charge', 'Peter', 'Hannan', 'London', 'neatly', 'autumn', 'English', 'landscape', 'beautifully.This', 'great', 'telefilm', 'public.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",The Gathering Storm

Practically ostracized by political class we see how a man can survive without doing what he liked the most: to command.Churchill here is displayed in the most ordinary, plain and because of that touching way I have ever seen. His frustration for being far from power makes him a bitter man and unbereable to live with. Albert Finney plays a wonderful Churchill. And if the real one was not like Finney, he should have been.While Baldwin was sure that anything would be better to avoid another war, Churchill was aware of the threating that Europe was facing. But his vision does not make him the hero of the film. Quite the contrary here he is shown as a man avid of power, who uses anything to regain it again. Here is Ralph Wigram (played by Linus Roache) who is the real hero of the film.But apart from the political point of view there is a nice love story between Churchill and his wife lady Clementine. And no one like Vanessa Redgrave to play her. Her distinction, manners and warmth make that this couple will be perfectly  real. We see a human Churchill, and I think is very interesting to show how this man, hunger for power had not real one in his own family. Too focused in politics is his wife who must deal with the boring problems of everydays life.It is a well made film.

They even sponsor an attempt to replace him in the district he represents, an event only hinted at in the movie. The period is about 1936 when concerned civil servants, like Ralph Wigram, begin to secretly provide Churchill with government papers that are being ignored by the Prime MInister, Stanley Baldwin played well by veteran actor Derek Jacobi. The film skips over the period of Munich, no doubt for the sake of time. It ends when Churchill becomes First Lord of the Admiralty when war is declared.

Perhaps it was felt that British viewers are so familiar with this period that there was no point in including it.  However, American viewers and I dare say those from most other countries would have benefited from and enjoyed seeing Churchill triumph over the utter failure of Chamberlain's policy of appeasement as Churchill assumed power in what had to be Britain's darkest days ever.

Larger than life and who defied all and sundry when he thought he was right (which was practically always). Could this or any other movie live up to the memory of a legend.

Vanessa Redgrave must also be acknowledged for her performance as the power behind the cigar.

These words were emoted with a tear in the eye.  I well believe it.If you listen to the director and producer commentary that is one of the special features that's on this dvd, you hear the above factoid as well as other very interesting anecdotes and history making facts that are not too well known.  I loved the commentary as much as the film.I read one reviewer say the film itself was boring.  Alas, life is boring for 90% of the time, not to mention frustrating.  This film covers both those energies from the point of view of Churchill during his 'wilderness years'.  It's not 'action-packed' because that's not the nature of the film and the time period it covers.  However, to me, it is ""action-packed"" in it's beautifully crafted portrayals of the tensions, conflict, love, hopes, fears and loyalties of all the actors and the characters they represent.  Every person is fleshed out with an authenticity that just makes you believe in the people they portray.  From 'Inches',to the maid, Ralph Wigram, even the little boy, 'Charlie' - superlative performances that come straight from the heart.  No 'phoning-it- in' here ladies and gentlemen.  Breathtaking.I LOVE this film.  I love the pathos, I love Alberts rendition of the man with his irrascible but vunerable nature.  I really believed I was watching Churchill.

It's half love story and half about how he was trying to warn how dangerous Hitler was to England. The story about his relationship with his wife was more entertaining than the historical part due to Finney and Vanessa Redgrave as his wife. He fought depression and was bankrupt at that time. He had a huge ego when it came to his political life but deep inside felt he didn't deserve his wife. Both in his personal and professional life he was a difficult person to deal with.The Gathering Storm won an Emmy for writing so maybe this movie just wasn't my cup of tea. Still, this movie wasn't quite a love story so I can't recommend this to fans of romance movies. It also wasn't centered around the events in England leading up to World War ll. So I can't recommend it to people who enjoy movies about history.If you want to learn more about Churchill, read a book about him.

731436,A2TJW1K1OLYXZS,B00007L4OF,Wildman,"[1, 1]","The greatness of Churchill's leadership was that he could take any of the most adverse conditions he found himself in and turn that around and overcome these through intelligence, tenacity, and an ability to endure great hardship while never letting the sight of victory out of his mind.  Albert Finney has turned in a remarkable performance as this great leader and has shown from start to finish the unvarnished character, warts and all, of a man driven to protect his country at all costs.  The film predates WWII by showing Churchill during his worst time politcally as a member of parliament and his rise back to power. His struggles during this time prepare him to meet the challenge of war later.  The focus of the film is a mirror of our own time and seeks to warn us of dictators who show us diplomacy but have intentions of conquest and how we as free peoples must be ready to meet the challenge.  Finney's performance carries us through the different challenges of his political and personal life and show Churchill to be just such an enduring leader.  Facing almost certain political oblivion he fights back to regain his power within the government and protect his country.  Finney's performance is well crafted with many moments of Churchill at his best and at his not so best.  Specifically when he is debating the members of parliament on the coming German threat and more intimately when he is discussing his patriotism to his wife Clementine he is virtually indistinguishable.  His faults are displayed plainly and without heavy handedness so as to make the audience part of the room.  Notably his dictation to his secretary when he momentarily forgets she's there and starts to change his pants and then is embarressed as she reminds him of her presence.  His displays of depression which were real and Churchill's attempts to ward them off with painting and bricklaying. Altogether this is a very good film for anyone wishing to view the innerworkings of one of the greatest leaders of all time.

To see him in the comforts of his scenic countryside home with his loyal wife and household staff gives proof to the saying that behind every great man is a strong woman.  This is as much Clementine Churchill's story as it is Winston's, though her role is downplayed.  He being a renaissance man was a perfect match to her stoic stand-by-your man mentality.  Without Clemmie I shudder to think that Winston Churchill could ever have found the courage to stand by his principals and lead England in it's darkest hour.  Excellent movie!
