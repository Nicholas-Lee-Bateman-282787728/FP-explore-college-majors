In fact, I liked the music so much I bought the soundtrack at Amazon.uk, the only place I could still find it.  It's the story of Nina, a gal who ran off on her wedding day to avoid marrying a man handpicked by her parents, someone she didn't love.  She returns for her father's funeral but also has hopes of fitting back into the family she left.  She finds the family must sell the Indian restaurant her father poured his heart into but Nina fights to save it and finds herself starting to fall for her brother's girlfriend in the process.  I'll let you find out the rest but it will leave you with a smile on your face at the end.  It's worth adding to your lesbian dvd collection.",5,Worth your time!

1134943,A10NM4PC3209XU,B00125WAWI,Deevah,"[2, 3]","The love story between the two gals is simply not believable because there is nothing prior to their ""awakening"" that indicates either one of them was physically or emotionally attracted to the other. Was Nina a lesbian when she first appears on the screen? Was Lisa a lesbian coincidentally working in the restaurant? No clues given. The director (Parma) was ultimately timid about the subject and the first kiss between Nina and Lisa is delivered without spark and passion -- and if there's more to being a lesbian than just two women kissing, you won't find it with these characters. The story of two women destined to find an interest in each other beyond their attachment to the restaurant lacks evolution. Finally, the pseudo-Bollywood ending was not only out of place, but it made whatever came before it absurd.",3,"A little entertaining, but director held back on central story",1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,819,"['love', 'story', 'two', 'gals', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'nothing', 'prior', 'awakening', 'one', 'was', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'attracted', 'other', 'Was', 'Nina', 'lesbian', 'when', 'first', 'screen', 'Was', 'Lisa', 'lesbian', 'coincidentally', 'working', 'restaurant', 'No', 'clues', 'given', 'director', 'Parma', 'was', 'ultimately', 'timid', 'subject', 'first', 'kiss', 'Nina', 'Lisa', 'delivered', 'spark', 'passion', 'more', 'being', 'lesbian', 'just', 'two', 'women', 'kissing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'characters', 'story', 'two', 'women', 'destined', 'find', 'interest', 'other', 'attachment', 'restaurant', 'evolution', 'Finally', 'pseudo-Bollywood', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'place', 'made', 'came']",N/A

We're both foodies and loved the theme of the film, but were disappointed with the lack of character and relationship development between the leads. I am not sure if anything was cut (we own the UK ed), but their relationship was just anti-climactic for us. I did enjoy the fact that the family was supportive of the lead's love interest-a welcomed portrayal for the gay community,and surely the film was risky given the taboos associated with being gay, in the Indian community. Overall, the best sizzle for me, came from imagining the taste of the food. It had its moments, but it was underwhelming for me. I am glad, however, that more humorous and sweet gay themed romances are making it to dvd and film festivals.",3,"Very cute concept, but lacked on-screen chemistry for me",1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,782,"['had', 'dvd', 'while', 'just', 'watched', 'partner', ""'re"", 'foodies', 'loved', 'theme', 'film', 'were', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'character', 'relationship', 'development', 'leads', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'anything', 'was', 'cut', 'own', 'UK', 'ed', 'relationship', 'was', 'just', 'anti-climactic', 'did', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'family', 'was', 'supportive', 'lead', 'love', 'interest-a', 'welcomed', 'portrayal', 'gay', 'community', 'surely', 'film', 'was', 'risky', 'given', 'taboos', 'associated', 'being', 'gay', 'Indian', 'community', 'Overall', 'best', 'sizzle', 'came', 'imagining', 'taste', 'food', 'had', 'moments', 'was', 'underwhelming', 'am', 'glad', 'however', 'more', 'humorous', 'sweet', 'gay', 'themed', 'romances', 'are', 'making', 'dvd', 'film', 'festivals']",N/A

The thing which made the film nice, is that it seemed sincere as a love story, and while the usual elements of gay love being unacceptable to some are in there, it is not another one of those ""we are so mistreated because we are gay"" films, as so many have been. Also, there is an equally important, if not moreso, plot, proceeding at the same time that the two girls begin to fall for each other.

We don't know why Nina really ran away to London - maybe she knew she liked girls, same for her counterpart in the film -- the director doesn't come out and identify either of these women as openly gay but that doesn't mean they aren't.And then - they realize they are both attracted - they don't have a big dialog, they just get it on, freak out, one wants to come out the other wants to stay in. It's a common dynamic - not every lesbian relationship is cut and dried, out and proud, self-assured and black and white.

1134950,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00125WAWI,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","""Nina's Heavenly Delights"" is actually more interesting for the milieu in which it's set - a community of Indian ex-pats living and thriving in Scotland - than for the story it has to tell.Nina (Shelley Conn) moved to London a few years back to escape an arranged marriage to a man she knew she could never learn to love.  When her father dies unexpectedly, Nina returns to Glascow to help run the Indian restaurant he`s owned and operated for decades.  Her partner in the endeavor is Lisa (Laura Fraser), a close friend of the family whom Nina finds herself falling in love with, a fact that may not sit too well with her traditionalist family.""Nina's Heavenly Delights"" is definitely a mixed-bag when it comes to virtues and flaws.  It's at its best in its quieter, more serious moments, as Nina engages in thoughtful discussions with her family members and her new-found love interest.  But when it aims for a more lighthearted tone, the movie tends towards the coy and the cloying.  The coming-out aspects of the tale are handled with delicacy and restraint, though the determinedly upbeat ending is a trifle on the implausible and unconvincing side, to put it mildly.  The movie also suffers from a surfeit of soulful montage sequences and irrelevant musical interludes, a holdover from its Bollywood roots, no doubt (the movie may be British in origin but its Indian influence is undeniable).  Moreover, the blending of gourmet cooking with magical realism feels too reminiscent of ""Like Water for Chocolate"" for total comfort.However, the performances are so authentic and the whole enterprise so well-meaning and upbeat that it's hard not to have positive feelings about the movie in the long run.",3,a fun movie when it isn't being cutesy,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,1705,"['Nina', 'Heavenly', 'Delights', 'actually', 'more', 'interesting', 'milieu', 'set', 'community', 'Indian', 'ex-pats', 'living', 'thriving', 'Scotland', 'story', 'tell.Nina', 'Shelley', 'Conn', 'moved', 'London', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'escape', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'man', 'knew', 'could', 'never', 'learn', 'love', 'When', 'father', 'dies', 'unexpectedly', 'Nina', 'Glascow', 'help', 'run', 'Indian', 'restaurant', 's', 'owned', 'operated', 'decades', 'partner', 'endeavor', 'Lisa', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'close', 'friend', 'family', 'whom', 'Nina', 'falling', 'love', 'fact', 'may', 'not', 'sit', 'too', 'well', 'traditionalist', 'family', 'Nina', 'Heavenly', 'Delights', 'definitely', 'mixed-bag', 'when', 'virtues', 'flaws', 'best', 'quieter', 'more', 'serious', 'moments', 'Nina', 'thoughtful', 'discussions', 'family', 'members', 'new-found', 'love', 'interest', 'when', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'movie', 'coy', 'cloying', 'coming-out', 'aspects', 'tale', 'are', 'handled', 'delicacy', 'restraint', 'determinedly', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'trifle', 'implausible', 'unconvincing', 'side', 'put', 'mildly', 'movie', 'also', 'surfeit', 'soulful', 'montage', 'sequences', 'irrelevant', 'musical', 'interludes', 'holdover', 'Bollywood', 'roots', 'doubt', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'British', 'origin', 'Indian', 'influence', 'undeniable', 'Moreover', 'blending', 'gourmet', 'cooking', 'magical', 'realism', 'feels', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'total', 'comfort.However', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'authentic', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'so', 'well-meaning', 'upbeat', 'hard', 'not', 'have', 'positive', 'feelings', 'movie', 'long', 'run']",N/A
