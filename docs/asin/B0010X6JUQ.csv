Funny, witty, clever, same exact story line every episode with the characters always falling into the same paths as they did all the other episodes but it was done with real panache.  It is one of our favorite TV show.  I've literally searched over a 5 or so year period trying to even rediscover what the name of the series was.  I always knew the 'dumb' guy in the office from some other series but I forgot what and the boss, the older guy.  I searched for him in other shows but never could track him down.  I was watching a Due South episode on dvd and there he was, Ken Pogue.  Now to see if I can get my hands on the dvds for Adderly, another journey altogether as none are available on amazon.

Granted the show is ""dated"" in terms of certain things, but then every TV show and movie are ""dated"".Adderly was ""unusual"" in terms of the main character having a handicap of an essentially useless hand but the way Rekert acted with the character's handicap was highly credible and his motives for trying to get out of the basement level back into regular spy service was part of the impetus for him sticking his nose into things.This series needs to be released on DVD in full because is it interesting, well acted and fun.",5,Adderly needs to be on DVD,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,757,"['am', 'sorry', 'hear', 'distributor', 'shut', 'doors', 'project.Adderly', 'IMO', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'TV', 'series', 'number', 'good', 'actors', 'Winston', 'Rekert', 'good', 'dialogue', 'nice', 'humor', 'smart', 'clever', 'overall', 'Granted', 'show', 'dated', 'terms', 'certain', 'things', 'then', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'are', 'dated', '.Adderly', 'was', 'unusual', 'terms', 'main', 'character', 'having', 'handicap', 'essentially', 'useless', 'hand', 'way', 'Rekert', 'acted', 'character', 'handicap', 'was', 'highly', 'credible', 'motives', 'trying', 'get', 'basement', 'level', 'back', 'regular', 'spy', 'service', 'was', 'part', 'impetus', 'sticking', 'nose', 'things.This', 'series', 'needs', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'full', 'because', 'interesting', 'well', 'acted', 'fun']",Adderly - Season 1
1126608,A2GF53PVZRJJR,B0010X6JUQ,"I. Alde ""BerkingKid""","[1, 1]","I loved everything about this show.  Adderly is a man who was cheated not only by his enemies, but also by the people who should support him.  He always goes out on a limb, is promised promotions, and where does it get him?  But he never gives up, always gives his best, no matter how frustrated he gets with his superiors.There is humor, too, mostly from his bumbling boss, Greenspan, played to the hilt by the late Jonathan Welch.  There's even a bit of romance with Mona, the adoring secretary who is always ready to help Adderly.All the actors are great, too, above all Winston Rekert, of course.",5,"Adderly, one of the best heroes ever",1247184000,"07 10, 2009",2009,600,"['loved', 'everything', 'show', 'Adderly', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'cheated', 'not', 'only', 'enemies', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'should', 'support', 'always', 'out', 'limb', 'promised', 'promotions', 'where', 'get', 'never', 'up', 'always', 'best', 'matter', 'how', 'frustrated', 'superiors.There', 'humor', 'too', 'mostly', 'bumbling', 'boss', 'Greenspan', 'played', 'hilt', 'late', 'Jonathan', 'Welch', 'even', 'bit', 'romance', 'Mona', 'adoring', 'secretary', 'who', 'always', 'ready', 'help', 'Adderly.All', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'Winston', 'Rekert', 'course']",Adderly - Season 1
