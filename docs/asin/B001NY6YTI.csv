The story is wretched. The characters morph without apparent justification from one bad stereotype to another. Their actions are equally senseless. For example, the boy--who seems afflicted with dissociative identity disorder--fritters his time interacting with animals he only just met instead of dreaming up scenes with his missing mother and father.While I hadn't read the book before, I did so afterwards (incredulous that this movie represented what the famous book was about), and I found that a charming story about love, faith, and the nature of reality had been perverted into something so treacly and cloying that they bore almost no resemblance to each other.There are SO many better ways to spend one's time and money.",1,A senseless movie to be avoided by the sensible.,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,894,"['Movies', 'steaming', 'pile', 'rabbit', 'droppings', 'make', 'sad', 'money', 'wasted', 'production', 'viewing', 'instead', 'just', 'given', 'away', 'indigent', 'story', 'wretched', 'characters', 'morph', 'apparent', 'justification', 'one', 'bad', 'stereotype', 'actions', 'are', 'equally', 'senseless', 'example', 'boy', 'who', 'afflicted', 'dissociative', 'identity', 'disorder', 'time', 'interacting', 'animals', 'only', 'just', 'met', 'instead', 'dreaming', 'up', 'scenes', 'missing', 'mother', 'father.While', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'did', 'so', 'afterwards', 'incredulous', 'movie', 'represented', 'what', 'famous', 'book', 'was', 'about', 'found', 'charming', 'story', 'love', 'faith', 'nature', 'reality', 'had', 'been', 'perverted', 'something', 'so', 'treacly', 'cloying', 'bore', 'almost', 'resemblance', 'are', 'SO', 'many', 'better', 'ways', 'spend', 'one', 'time', 'money']","Velveteen Rabbit, The abe"
1221345,AH93HX89KVQG2,B001NY6YTI,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[7, 7]","This movie has the same basic message as the book: Love makes you real. But it is not meant to be a perfectly faithful adaptation; rather, the book is a springboard for the fanciful journey the movie takes. The movie's credits state that it is ""inspired by"" Margery Williams' story.Michael Landon did a great job of retaining the heart of the book while telling a very enjoyable story that stands on its own right. It is wonderful to see how love opens up the characters over the course of the movie and changes them for the better. Definitely a tearjerker (for adults anyway). The story borrows themes from several classic children's tales, such as The Secret Garden and Pollyanna, and weaves them together with the moral of the Velveteen Rabbit to create an inspiring, heartwarming tale.I still would love to see a faithful live action or animated adaptation of the Velveteen Rabbit. I found the Meryl Streep narrated version to be slow and boring -- why sit there and watch that when I could just go read the book? But this movie does bring the same feelings and thoughts to me as reading the book does, even with the changes made to the story.",4,Great movie - INSPIRED by the book,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,1147,"['movie', 'same', 'basic', 'message', 'book', 'Love', 'real', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'perfectly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'rather', 'book', 'springboard', 'fanciful', 'journey', 'movie', 'movie', 'credits', 'state', 'inspired', 'Margery', 'Williams', 'story.Michael', 'Landon', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'retaining', 'heart', 'book', 'telling', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'own', 'right', 'wonderful', 'see', 'how', 'love', 'up', 'characters', 'course', 'movie', 'changes', 'better', 'Definitely', 'tearjerker', 'adults', 'anyway', 'story', 'themes', 'several', 'classic', 'children', 'tales', 'such', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Pollyanna', 'together', 'moral', 'Velveteen', 'Rabbit', 'create', 'inspiring', 'heartwarming', 'tale.I', 'still', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'faithful', 'live', 'action', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'Velveteen', 'Rabbit', 'found', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'narrated', 'version', 'be', 'slow', 'boring', 'why', 'sit', 'watch', 'when', 'could', 'just', 'go', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'bring', 'same', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'reading', 'book', 'even', 'changes', 'made', 'story']","Velveteen Rabbit, The abe"

1221347,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B001NY6YTI,blackaciddevil,"[4, 5]","While there have been many versions of this tale told before, this movie would have to be the definitive version, in my opinion. Based upon Margery Williams's 1922 novel, ""The Velveteen Rabbit""; it is a story that children and adults alike agree that truly moves the soul.While his father is off to conduct business, Toby is left in the care of his grandmother. It's clear from the get-go that she is very intolerable of children. Forced to entertain himself there, he comes across Rabbit. Rabbit is a stuffed toy who comes alive in Toby's imagination. Toby also meets Swan and Horse who also comes alive in his imagination. All three toys hope to be made into real animals by the power of love. Soon, Toby's grandmother comes around and realizes how she has been with Toby. Yet, Toby comes down with scarlet fever. This threatens the safety of the toys so they urge him to reach out to his father before it is too late. It is a reimagining that tells of the power of affection.I tell you, I've never been so moved by a children's movie as I have with this one. I was moved to tears by movie's end, I have to admit. Michael Landon Jr. truly outdoes himself directing this feature, which features a mix of live-action, CGI, and 2-D. Alternating between reality and Toby's mind. While I've seen other movies directed by Landon Jr., this-by far- has to be his best work. I'd love to see him direct other children's stories like this.The Velveteen Rabbit features the voices of Golden Globe winner Jane Seymour, Emmy Award winner Tom Skerritt, and Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn. Chandler Wakefield provides the voice of Rabbit.I highly recommend this movie to all.

Feeling abandoned and lonely, Toby explores the house and comes across the ""Magic Room"", which is filled with his father's old toys, including a rabbit stuffed toy. As Toby's imagination is given free rein, Rabbit comes 'alive' in a lively world of animation, and Toby together with rabbit and the other toys in the magic room run free and play in a lively dream world. The animals, i.e. Horse [Tom Skerritt], Swan [Ellen Burstyn], and Rabbit [Chandler Wakefiled] all dream of becoming real animals, and as we all know from ""The Velveteen Rabbit"", that can only be achieved by true love.
