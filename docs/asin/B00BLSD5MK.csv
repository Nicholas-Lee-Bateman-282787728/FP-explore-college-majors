I had to force myself to watch the entire movie, hoping it would get better, but it was a real waste of 99 minutes which I will never get back. I generally love anything with Keanu Reeves, after all, he's KEANU REEVES!, but this dog is a waste of anyone's time unless you like boring scenes of two pathetic girls with borderline personality disorder who drink and drug to forget they are sex workers. Reeves is one of those rare actors who can be in the worst of movies and still turn in a fine performance,but even Reeve's talent cannot save this dreck.",1,What was he thinking?,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,653,"['What', 'was', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'thinking', 'when', 'decided', 'be', 'film-and', 'use', 'word', 'film', 'lightly', 'had', 'force', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'hoping', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'was', 'real', 'waste', '99', 'minutes', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back', 'generally', 'love', 'anything', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'KEANU', 'REEVES', 'dog', 'waste', 'anyone', 'time', 'boring', 'scenes', 'two', 'pathetic', 'girls', 'borderline', 'personality', 'disorder', 'who', 'drink', 'drug', 'forget', 'are', 'sex', 'workers', 'Reeves', 'one', 'rare', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'worst', 'movies', 'still', 'turn', 'fine', 'performance', 'even', 'Reeve', 'talent', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'dreck']",generation Um...
1635538,A1WQ0BDPHNMF9S,B00BLSD5MK,"Cowboy ""Kaatje""","[2, 4]","ADDENDUM: A few days later, I am changing this review to three stars up from one. Why? Because the intentions of the movie were decent, and although it did not pull it off for me, there is no way to truly say ""I hated it"". And I can imagine that some people would like it for its different views. Another indie flick that seemed to come straight out of film school is "" Letter"" with Wynona Ryder and James Franco, which also got disastrous reviews. Yet again, it was daring to make that movie too, and I really enjoyed it. I did not enjoy this movie, but I am really glad that small indie films like this get made.Okay. Some thought must have gone into the movie, and surely anyone will agree how hard it is to get a picture financed, let alone have Keanu Reeves star in it. Then there's the location scouting, music, make-up and screenplay. However, this is like watching adults with mild traumatic brain injury or cognitive impairment acting out their demons...ALL DAY LONG.About twenty minutes into the movie, Reeves picks up/steals a camera (which magically never needs charging) and starts shooting, first chipmunks and squirrels, then trees, then dogs, then finally himself, like an 8 year old. We all made boring photos and videos back in the day, and this is a movie of how that boring video was made. Further, more disturbing than the magical thinking/slightly discoherent thought process of the male lead, is that Reeves by now is about 48 years old, and in this movie works as an escort chauffeur/friend of two women who are at least 25 if not 30 years his junior.The sound quality was terrible, and the only highlight and actor whose voice I could fully understand was the brief appearance of charismatic Daniel Sunjata, who no doubt is going to be a big star. I cannot quite imagine why Reeves decided to do this picture. The principal photography shows a truly juvenile approach, a film school quality including all the NYC cliches you can imagine. There were some moments that felt real, like the one girl, Mia, being a total idiot in a bar, and really, Bojana Novakovic is a great comedic actress. I hope that someday she will get the screenplay she deserves.At times, this movie felt like it could have been written by James Toback, who, aside from the hit The Pickup Artist, is known for movies like Two Guys and a Girl with Robert Downey Jr back in his drug fueled days, and features a naked Heather Graham. This is not a compliment. I felt, no matter how sincere the effort in providing a realistic portrait of escorts/party girls in NYC, that ultimately the movie was degrading, and worst of all, pretentious. I never once rooted for a character and in the end, just wanted all of them to die a horrible death.Much better movies were done about this topic, as well as the soul searching of a forty-something drop out, such as the fine ""Jeff who lives at home"". The best and funniest part of the movie is where Reeves' character gets a birth day card from his mom with a check for 75.00, marked for ""medications ;=)"". Just wished he had cashed that check and gone to the pharmacy. Other movies that come to mind: The Whistleblower with Rachel Weisz, or Escort, a South African indie movie (hope I do not need to remind anyone that there is a big difference between voluntary and involuntary working girls?). I am not a fan of movies like Pretty Woman either, as a matter of fact hated it, but this was more of a docudrama, or infotainment.",3,"Generation ""I just got out of Film School""",1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,3459,"['ADDENDUM', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'am', 'changing', 'review', 'three', 'stars', 'up', 'one', 'Why', 'intentions', 'movie', 'were', 'decent', 'did', 'not', 'pull', 'off', 'way', 'truly', 'say', 'hated', 'can', 'imagine', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'different', 'views', 'indie', 'flick', 'seemed', 'come', 'straight', 'film', 'school', 'Letter', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'James', 'Franco', 'also', 'got', 'disastrous', 'reviews', 'Yet', 'again', 'was', 'daring', 'make', 'movie', 'too', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'small', 'indie', 'films', 'get', 'made.Okay', 'thought', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'movie', 'surely', 'anyone', 'will', 'agree', 'how', 'hard', 'get', 'picture', 'financed', 'let', 'alone', 'have', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'star', 'Then', 'location', 'scouting', 'music', 'make-up', 'screenplay', 'However', 'watching', 'adults', 'mild', 'traumatic', 'brain', 'injury', 'cognitive', 'impairment', 'acting', 'out', 'demons', 'DAY', 'LONG.About', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'picks', 'up/steals', 'camera', 'magically', 'never', 'charging', 'shooting', 'first', 'chipmunks', 'squirrels', 'then', 'trees', 'then', 'dogs', 'then', 'finally', '8', 'year', 'old', 'made', 'boring', 'photos', 'videos', 'back', 'day', 'movie', 'how', 'boring', 'video', 'was', 'made', 'Further', 'more', 'disturbing', 'magical', 'thinking/slightly', 'discoherent', 'thought', 'process', 'male', 'lead', 'Reeves', 'now', '48', 'years', 'old', 'movie', 'escort', 'chauffeur/friend', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'least', '25', 'not', '30', 'years', 'junior.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'terrible', 'only', 'highlight', 'actor', 'voice', 'could', 'fully', 'understand', 'was', 'brief', 'appearance', 'charismatic', 'Daniel', 'Sunjata', 'who', 'doubt', 'going', 'be', 'big', 'star', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'imagine', 'why', 'Reeves', 'decided', 'do', 'picture', 'principal', 'photography', 'truly', 'juvenile', 'approach', 'film', 'school', 'quality', 'including', 'NYC', 'cliches', 'can', 'imagine', 'were', 'moments', 'felt', 'real', 'one', 'girl', 'Mia', 'being', 'total', 'idiot', 'bar', 'really', 'Bojana', 'Novakovic', 'great', 'comedic', 'actress', 'hope', 'someday', 'will', 'get', 'screenplay', 'times', 'movie', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'James', 'Toback', 'who', 'aside', 'hit', 'Pickup', 'Artist', 'known', 'movies', 'Two', 'Guys', 'Girl', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'back', 'drug', 'fueled', 'days', 'naked', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'not', 'compliment', 'felt', 'matter', 'how', 'sincere', 'effort', 'providing', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'escorts/party', 'girls', 'NYC', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'was', 'degrading', 'worst', 'pretentious', 'never', 'once', 'rooted', 'character', 'end', 'just', 'wanted', 'die', 'horrible', 'death.Much', 'better', 'movies', 'were', 'done', 'topic', 'as', 'well', 'soul', 'searching', 'forty-something', 'drop', 'out', 'such', 'fine', 'Jeff', 'who', 'home', 'best', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'where', 'Reeves', 'character', 'birth', 'day', 'card', 'mom', 'check', '75.00', 'marked', 'medications', 'Just', 'wished', 'had', 'cashed', 'check', 'gone', 'pharmacy', 'Other', 'movies', 'come', 'mind', 'Whistleblower', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Escort', 'South', 'African', 'indie', 'movie', 'hope', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'remind', 'anyone', 'big', 'difference', 'voluntary', 'involuntary', 'working', 'girls', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'movies', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'either', 'matter', 'fact', 'hated', 'was', 'more', 'docudrama', 'infotainment']",generation Um...

The high point of GENERATION UM is a guy stealing a camcorder. {Also noteworthy: The Special Features include an extended 4-minute cut of the same guy standing in a doorway eating a cupcake.} A number of people obviously like this film, and I respect that, but I can't believe that I'm the sole voice of dissent here. Anyone who wants a good old-fashioned solid storyline with suspense, surprises, something in the way of character development, and all that sort of stuff is likely to be very disappointed.Many will rent or buy this simply because they want to see some gritty, raunchy stuff: Those people are also likely to be disappointed. As a character study or thematic think-piece, there are some interesting fleeting nuances, but they hardly carry the film. {But that's just the point: These characters are bored and apathetic and don't feel much like talking about their childhoods, what they want out of life, etc.}This film gets one additional star from me because of its immediate realism, natural acting, and detailed camera work--the footage of NYC is quite captivating in places. Yet, these elements are not much use when the plot is so forlorn.

1635540,A39IOE754BUPQ1,B00BLSD5MK,"D. Smith ""Music Lover""","[3, 5]","Okay an admission, I rented this movie for one reason and one reason only - Adelaide Clemens, whom I first saw in the HBO British mini-series ""The Last Parade"" where she played a young free-spirited girl who falls in love with a married aristocrat during WWI.  She was charm personified and I was smitten.  With her in ""UM"", and since it had a big-name actor in it and the brief description sounded interesting I gave it a shot.  Well, the only thing worth watching was, yes, Adelaide Clemens. She has everything an actress needs for stardom: beauty, charisma, acting ability, and the camera loves her. I predict big things for her in years to come.  Alas, I actually FF thru most of the movie to find something happening.  Most movies have a beginning, a middle, and an end.  This movie had nothing but middle - no beginning and no end.  Watching Reeves eat that damned cupcake was like watching grass grow.  Indie films are a good thing; how else is a struggling young writer/director going to get a start?  But too often the directors  try so hard to be an ""auteur"" like some French directors (you know who I mean) and don't bother to learn the nuts and bolts of good filmmaking.  They would be better off studying Alfred Hitchcock or John Ford instead of contemplating their navel, so to speak, which this movie does a lot of.

1635541,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B00BLSD5MK,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[1, 1]","""Generation Um"" (released 2011) is a very static film, more about the ennui of being by turns bored, underemployed, irritated, and unmotivated in a big city (various parts of greater New York City). I guess that a lot of life in 20th and 21st century times has been, and can be, like that, especially if one is so lax in exercising any control over his life and ways as the characters in this film are. One of the two leading ladies does fellate John (who is Keanu Reeves' character), not in the apartment which she and he (as well as the other young woman) share, but in a public restroom, to John's visible delight. At another point he has an escape scene bounding away, several people in hot pursuit, with a portable film camera that he has stolen and his use of which forms most of what the remainder of the movie is about. The scene of Keanu filming and trying to outwit the camera-shy squirrels is cute, in a pretty inner-city park. Keanu's quirkily bobbing and bouncing head and torso dance motions at the steering wheel of his automobile have some charm, too. Most of the time, though, things are worse than dull; they are just in near-complete stasis for the 96-min. duration of this motion picture.There is little point for most viewers to bother with the extended and cut footage, among the scant extra features on the widescreen bilingual edition (English and French, but with no subtitles in those or in any other languages) which I have. If anything, such footage is even more snooze-inducing than what is in the final film itself.I am an ""unconditional"" fan of Keanu Reeves, so I watched the whole, seemingly endless thing. Keanu looks just fine in the film, lean-and-lankily fit and scruffily semi-bearded. It certainly is not his fault that this film is so listless; what little of genuine interest in it is due to his acting and to the New York cityscape itself. I'll keep this DVD ""for completeness' sake"" among my many, many Keanu Reeves films, but I doubt that I am likely to view it again any time soon.",3,The Sheer Torpor of It All Is Downright Palpable!,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,2025,"['Generation', 'Um', 'released', '2011', 'very', 'static', 'film', 'more', 'ennui', 'being', 'turns', 'bored', 'underemployed', 'irritated', 'unmotivated', 'big', 'city', 'various', 'parts', 'greater', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'guess', 'lot', 'life', '20th', '21st', 'century', 'times', 'been', 'can', 'be', 'especially', 'one', 'so', 'lax', 'exercising', 'control', 'life', 'ways', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'One', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'fellate', 'John', 'who', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'character', 'not', 'apartment', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'young', 'woman', 'share', 'public', 'restroom', 'John', 'visible', 'delight', 'point', 'escape', 'scene', 'bounding', 'away', 'several', 'people', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'portable', 'film', 'camera', 'stolen', 'use', 'most', 'what', 'remainder', 'movie', 'about', 'scene', 'Keanu', 'filming', 'trying', 'outwit', 'camera-shy', 'squirrels', 'cute', 'pretty', 'inner-city', 'park', 'Keanu', 'quirkily', 'bobbing', 'bouncing', 'head', 'torso', 'dance', 'motions', 'steering', 'wheel', 'automobile', 'have', 'charm', 'too', 'Most', 'time', 'though', 'things', 'are', 'worse', 'dull', 'are', 'just', 'near-complete', 'stasis', '96-min', 'duration', 'motion', 'little', 'point', 'most', 'viewers', 'bother', 'extended', 'cut', 'footage', 'scant', 'extra', 'features', 'widescreen', 'bilingual', 'edition', 'English', 'French', 'subtitles', 'other', 'languages', 'have', 'anything', 'such', 'footage', 'even', 'more', 'snooze-inducing', 'what', 'final', 'film', 'itself.I', 'am', 'unconditional', 'fan', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'watched', 'whole', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'thing', 'Keanu', 'just', 'fine', 'film', 'lean-and-lankily', 'fit', 'scruffily', 'semi-bearded', 'certainly', 'not', 'fault', 'film', 'so', 'listless', 'what', 'genuine', 'interest', 'due', 'acting', 'New', 'York', 'cityscape', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'DVD', 'completeness', 'sake', 'many', 'many', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'films', 'doubt', 'am', 'likely', 'view', 'again', 'time', 'soon']",generation Um...
