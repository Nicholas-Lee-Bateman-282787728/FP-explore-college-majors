It is also a bit historical these days but it has never lost its edge and proves you can do a good program in a half hour as one can in an hour. It also introduced us to some great characters, Pete Malloy, Jim Reed, Ed Wells, Sgt. Mc Donald. They were every cop and they were involved in all kinds of situations from the silly to the intense. While it may seem a bit dated in some ways, the action isn't. It is still as fresh as it was when it was first aired.

I liked it when it was new, and I think high production values and realistic representation of the LAPD have left us with a show that's aged so well that I don't anything since has ever come close (other Jack Webb productions excluded, of course). There's just enough of a human element to make the the characters real yet no so much that it sidetracks the fast-paced action. It's hard to believe how much ground these shows cover in a single episode, literally and figuratively.My only beef, and reason I had to give this a 4 instead of a 5 is because the first of the four DVDs is saddled with a promo for three really sad 1980s shows that is one of the longest and most annoying I've ever seen on any TV show or movie I've ever purchased. It just goes on and on and on. It's more of an infomercial than a commercial or promo really.
