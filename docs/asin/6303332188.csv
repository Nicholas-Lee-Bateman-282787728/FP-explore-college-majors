Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[8, 9]","Just like its predecessor, &quot;Odyssey Into The Mind's Eye,&quot;  this DVD has astounding computer animated graphics that will leave the viewer's eyes delighted in a feast of colors and light.What sets this DVD apart  from the first one is the soundtrack.  While &quot;Odyssey&quot; had a  ho-hum soundtrack, this one features a soundtrack written by Jan Hammer.  In fact, the music is from one of his albums by the same name.  The graphic  overtures in this DVD were modeled around Hammer's music, and not the other  way around.  That, I think, is the big difference.  In the first DVD the  music seemed to be more or less an afterthought where as in this one it is  integrated much more artistically into the sequences (not to mention the  music itself is of a much higher calibre than the first DVD).I would  highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in computer generated  graphics.  It's a fun and exciting excursion into virtual reality;  one  which will make full use of both the impressive picture and CD quality  sound offered by DVD.",5,Fantastic!,957744000,"05 8, 2000",2000,1051,"['Just', 'predecessor', 'quot', 'Odyssey', 'Into', 'Mind', 'Eye', 'quot', 'DVD', 'astounding', 'computer', 'animated', 'graphics', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'eyes', 'delighted', 'feast', 'colors', 'light.What', 'sets', 'DVD', 'apart', 'first', 'one', 'soundtrack', 'quot', 'Odyssey', 'quot', 'had', 'ho-hum', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'soundtrack', 'written', 'Jan', 'Hammer', 'fact', 'music', 'one', 'albums', 'same', 'name', 'graphic', 'overtures', 'DVD', 'were', 'modeled', 'Hammer', 'music', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'think', 'big', 'difference', 'first', 'DVD', 'music', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'afterthought', 'where', 'as', 'one', 'integrated', 'much', 'more', 'artistically', 'sequences', 'not', 'mention', 'music', 'much', 'higher', 'calibre', 'first', 'DVD', '.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'interested', 'computer', 'generated', 'graphics', 'fun', 'exciting', 'excursion', 'virtual', 'reality', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'full', 'use', 'impressive', 'picture', 'CD', 'quality', 'sound', 'offered', 'DVD']",Beyond the Mind's Eye VHS
369695,AU03GLDS5TM0M,6303332188,Foot Artist,"[0, 0]","Being a Sci-Fi illustrator in the traditional and computer medium I can appreciate the work that goes into creating art like the one contained in this CD. Who would have ever thought that mathematics could produce beauty like this (science has known it all along....and science fiction has provided us with limitless possibilities), but now everyone can explore the beauty of equations!And even if you're not an artist, mathematician, or scientist...you're sure to enjoy all the colors and shapes for what they are...a visual feast. I used to own &quot;Beyond The Mind's Eye&quot; on VHS before I bought the DVD; the quality is so much better.I enjoy this and my many other digital animation CD's in many ways...There are times when I feel like sitting in front of my big screen TV and just feeling transported to all the fantastic places created by the animators. Other times I enjoy playing it as background while I cook or chat with friends. It is a great ambiance enhancer.I started collecting digital animation tapes back in 1994 because playing them made me feel so futuristic...living in a world where technology is in complete harmony with nature. I am such a technophile. I say technophiles of the world UNITE! Buy &quot;Beyond The Mind's Eye&quot; and enjoy the future today!",5,COLOR-FILLED FEAST FOR THE EYES,995500800,"07 19, 2001",2001,1285,"['Being', 'Sci-Fi', 'illustrator', 'traditional', 'computer', 'medium', 'can', 'appreciate', 'work', 'creating', 'art', 'one', 'contained', 'CD', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'thought', 'mathematics', 'could', 'produce', 'beauty', 'science', 'known', '.and', 'science', 'fiction', 'provided', 'limitless', 'possibilities', 'now', 'everyone', 'can', 'explore', 'beauty', 'equations', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'artist', 'mathematician', 'scientist', ""'re"", 'sure', 'enjoy', 'colors', 'shapes', 'what', 'are', 'visual', 'feast', 'used', 'own', 'quot', 'Beyond', 'Mind', 'Eye', 'quot', 'VHS', 'bought', 'DVD', 'quality', 'so', 'much', 'better.I', 'enjoy', 'many', 'other', 'digital', 'animation', 'CD', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'feel', 'sitting', 'front', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', 'just', 'feeling', 'transported', 'fantastic', 'places', 'created', 'animators', 'Other', 'times', 'enjoy', 'playing', 'background', 'cook', 'chat', 'friends', 'great', 'ambiance', 'enhancer.I', 'started', 'collecting', 'digital', 'animation', 'tapes', 'back', '1994', 'playing', 'made', 'feel', 'so', 'futuristic', 'living', 'world', 'where', 'technology', 'complete', 'harmony', 'nature', 'am', 'technophile', 'say', 'technophiles', 'world', 'UNITE', 'Buy', 'quot', 'Beyond', 'Mind', 'Eye', 'quot', 'enjoy', 'future', 'today']",Beyond the Mind's Eye VHS

Wallace ""kirby at  wallaceinfo dee-o...","[2, 3]","The movie visuals were really stunning back in the early 90's when this thing was made, and by today's standards, they are, well, kind of cheesy.  But I bought the VHS and liked the music so much that I bought the soundtrack CD.  And I liked the closing credits music so much that I bought the DVD just so I could rip the closing credits track.  It's about twice as long as the actual song on the soundtrack CD and it's my fav.  So I bought the DVD just to get the long-edit of the closing titles track.  It's that good.As has been said elsewhere, the track order is different on the DVD, so when I want to watch it, I have to watch the VHS.  You have to understand that because it's a staple with my kids, I've watched the thing literally a hundred times or more!  So the track order on the VHS is permanently etched into my head!",5,Bought it for the soundtrack,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,831,"['movie', 'visuals', 'were', 'really', 'stunning', 'back', 'early', '90', 'when', 'thing', 'was', 'made', 'today', 'standards', 'are', 'well', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'bought', 'VHS', 'liked', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'liked', 'closing', 'credits', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'DVD', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'rip', 'closing', 'credits', 'track', 'about', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'actual', 'song', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'fav', 'bought', 'DVD', 'just', 'get', 'long-edit', 'closing', 'track', 'good.As', 'been', 'said', 'elsewhere', 'track', 'order', 'different', 'DVD', 'when', 'want', 'watch', 'have', 'watch', 'VHS', 'have', 'understand', 'staple', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'thing', 'literally', 'hundred', 'times', 'more', 'track', 'order', 'VHS', 'permanently', 'etched', 'head']",Beyond the Mind's Eye VHS
369698,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,6303332188,The Wickerman,"[0, 0]","This is a pretty cool video.  Great animation, with cool images.  It ranges from simple stuff, like a hornet chasing a smaller insect through a forest, to weird stuff, like the &quot;Too Far&quot; soda thing.  Bear in  mind that there's no point to any of this, other than for you to go  &quot;wow, that's pretty cool&quot;.  They're really more like music videos  than stories.  You may be able to make a story out of some of it, but it's  mostly just a lot of weirdness.  The key thing, don't think about it too  hard, just enjoy it.  Jan Hammer's no musical genius, but his compositions  add to the coolness of it all.  By the way, this is a sequel, the first was  called &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot;, but I've never seen it.  From what I've  heard, I don't think it's as good.  I apologize if anything I've said about  this video was inaccurate, but I haven't seen it in a couple of years, I  just was thinking about it a while back, and decided to review it.  I'll  have to check it out again some time.  In conclusion, this may be weird,  but it's undeniably cool, so check it out.  I guarantee you've never seen  anything like it.",5,Cool!,956793600,"04 27, 2000",2000,1135,"['pretty', 'cool', 'video', 'Great', 'animation', 'cool', 'images', 'simple', 'stuff', 'hornet', 'chasing', 'smaller', 'insect', 'forest', 'weird', 'stuff', 'quot', 'Too', 'Far', 'quot', 'soda', 'thing', 'Bear', 'mind', 'point', 'other', 'go', 'quot', 'wow', 'pretty', 'cool', 'quot', ""'re"", 'really', 'more', 'music', 'videos', 'stories', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'story', 'mostly', 'just', 'lot', 'weirdness', 'key', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'just', 'enjoy', 'Jan', 'Hammer', 'musical', 'genius', 'compositions', 'add', 'coolness', 'way', 'sequel', 'first', 'was', 'called', 'quot', 'Mind', 'Eye', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'good', 'apologize', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'said', 'video', 'was', 'inaccurate', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'couple', 'years', 'just', 'was', 'thinking', 'while', 'back', 'decided', 'review', ""'ll"", 'have', 'check', 'out', 'again', 'time', 'conclusion', 'may', 'be', 'weird', 'undeniably', 'cool', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'guarantee', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything']",Beyond the Mind's Eye VHS
