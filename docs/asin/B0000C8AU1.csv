774030,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0000C8AU1,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[9, 11]","America is fighting an unpopular war; the President is trying to shift the balance of the Supreme Court with his judicial nominee; the front line of political debate is an out-of-control press, and there's a wild man running around who looks rather disturbingly like Howard Dean.  No, I'm not talking about the state of affairs in 2005; I'm talking about Werewolf of Washington, an undeniably unique 1973 film that combines horror, comedy, and political parody in ways I would never have imagined on my own.  I'm going to go ahead and slap a ""you've got to see it to believe it"" sticker on this one.  This is clearly a very weird product of its times - it is, in a word, kooky.Dean Stockwell plays Jack Whittier, a hotshot young reporter with a close connection to the White House (in the form of the First Daughter); his idea of ending the relationship involved getting a transfer to Hungary, of all places, and making it look like his newspaper sent him there as some kind of punishment.  The President (Biff McGuire) thinks he was banished for his favorable articles on the White House, so he snatches Jack up as his new press agent.  Before Jack can get out of Budapest, however, he goes and gets himself bitten by a werewolf.  After his return to Washington, he starts seeing pentagrams on select people's hands and experiencing blackouts during the times those people are killed.  (The writers work in not one but two pentagram-Pentagon confusion jokes, which gives you a pretty good idea of the comedic effectiveness of this whole film.)  Eventually, Jack figures out that he has indeed been cursed, but no one really believes his claims that he is a werewolf - certainly not the President, who becomes thicker and thicker in the head as the story progresses.  The transformations are interesting - it's just your standard time-lapse photography, but the early phase has Jack scrunching his face all over the place, and I swear he looks exactly like Howard Dean when he pushes his jaw out and gets that ""Yeeeoooooow"" look in his eyes.  Once the transformation is complete, though, Jack just looks like an idiot - this may be the stupidest-looking werewolf in the history of cinema.Once the whole werewolf setup is complete, the movie gets down to some serious (and seriously bad) political parody work.  You've got hippies and other subversives for the Attorney General and FBI to keep their eye on, you've got the Watergate Hotel, you've got the President ""cleverly"" sidestepping questions he doesn't want to answer, and you've even got a little Agnew humor thrown in for good measure.  The President's a dunderhead who gets stranger as his political support erodes, but the Attorney General is the real piece of work on display here.  He's too honest for his own good, according to the President, and he's a master at speaking without thinking (just see how quickly he jumps from werewolf to Black Panther when it comes to a murder suspect).  Then there's the war room meeting - I can't even begin to describe that scene.  Toss in a ""you won't have Jack Whittier to kick around anymore"" line at the end, wrap it all up, and you've got the most unique werewolf film I've ever seen.The political satire bit (which you've really got to see for yourself to appreciate - or not) is the only thing that makes this hairy dog of a movie remotely interesting.  As horror, it's a total bomb.  It basically strikes out when it comes to the comedy thing, too - but at least it's a weird, interesting kind of bomb in that regard.",2,"Horror, comedy, and 1973 political satire make this one unique",1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,3525,"['America', 'fighting', 'unpopular', 'war', 'President', 'trying', 'shift', 'balance', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'judicial', 'nominee', 'front', 'line', 'political', 'debate', 'out-of-control', 'press', 'wild', 'man', 'running', 'around', 'who', 'rather', 'disturbingly', 'Howard', 'Dean', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'state', 'affairs', '2005', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Werewolf', 'Washington', 'undeniably', 'unique', '1973', 'film', 'horror', 'comedy', 'political', 'parody', 'ways', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'imagined', 'own', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'ahead', 'slap', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'believe', 'sticker', 'one', 'clearly', 'very', 'weird', 'product', 'times', 'word', 'kooky.Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Jack', 'Whittier', 'hotshot', 'young', 'reporter', 'close', 'connection', 'White', 'House', 'form', 'First', 'Daughter', 'idea', 'ending', 'relationship', 'involved', 'getting', 'transfer', 'Hungary', 'places', 'making', 'look', 'newspaper', 'sent', 'there', 'kind', 'punishment', 'President', 'Biff', 'McGuire', 'was', 'banished', 'favorable', 'articles', 'White', 'House', 'Jack', 'up', 'new', 'press', 'agent', 'Jack', 'can', 'get', 'Budapest', 'however', 'bitten', 'werewolf', 'return', 'Washington', 'seeing', 'pentagrams', 'select', 'people', 'hands', 'experiencing', 'blackouts', 'times', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'writers', 'work', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'pentagram-Pentagon', 'confusion', 'jokes', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'comedic', 'effectiveness', 'whole', 'film', 'Eventually', 'Jack', 'out', 'indeed', 'been', 'cursed', 'one', 'really', 'claims', 'werewolf', 'certainly', 'not', 'President', 'who', 'thicker', 'thicker', 'head', 'story', 'transformations', 'are', 'interesting', 'just', 'standard', 'time-lapse', 'photography', 'early', 'phase', 'Jack', 'scrunching', 'face', 'place', 'swear', 'exactly', 'like', 'Howard', 'Dean', 'when', 'jaw', 'Yeeeoooooow', 'look', 'eyes', 'transformation', 'complete', 'though', 'Jack', 'just', 'idiot', 'may', 'be', 'stupidest-looking', 'werewolf', 'history', 'cinema.Once', 'whole', 'werewolf', 'setup', 'complete', 'movie', 'down', 'serious', 'seriously', 'bad', 'political', 'parody', 'work', ""'ve"", 'got', 'hippies', 'other', 'subversives', 'Attorney', 'General', 'FBI', 'keep', 'eye', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Watergate', 'Hotel', ""'ve"", 'got', 'President', 'cleverly', 'sidestepping', 'questions', ""n't"", 'want', 'answer', ""'ve"", 'even', 'got', 'little', 'Agnew', 'humor', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'President', 'dunderhead', 'who', 'stranger', 'political', 'support', 'erodes', 'Attorney', 'General', 'real', 'piece', 'work', 'display', 'here', 'too', 'honest', 'own', 'good', 'according', 'President', 'master', 'speaking', 'thinking', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'quickly', 'werewolf', 'Black', 'Panther', 'when', 'murder', 'suspect', 'Then', 'war', 'room', 'meeting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'scene', 'Toss', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'Jack', 'Whittier', 'kick', 'around', 'anymore', 'line', 'end', 'wrap', 'up', ""'ve"", 'got', 'most', 'unique', 'werewolf', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'political', 'satire', 'bit', ""'ve"", 'really', 'got', 'see', 'appreciate', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'hairy', 'dog', 'movie', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'horror', 'total', 'bomb', 'basically', 'out', 'when', 'comedy', 'thing', 'too', 'least', 'weird', 'interesting', 'kind', 'bomb', 'regard']",N/A

774035,A3Q4T0TJM1VZMR,B0000C8AU1,Stephen Cannon,"[0, 0]","Where to start with train wreck?First, the filmmakers had little idea of what the White House is like. Particularly after seeing a few seasons of West Wing, it is hard to ignore that it seems only slightly bigger than my parent's house in Iowa and that there is only three or four people in it aside from the president. The room the Joint Chiefs of Staff meet in looks like our local VFW. The president has a staff of two or three guys and no bodyguards whatsoever and doesn't seem to have much to do with himself other than attend parties and bowl. In the second to last scene when the president is talking with the Chinese prime minister (the country has a president, but the filmmakers didn't check that one), the plane is a small puddle jumper, there are no staff present on either the Chinese or the American side, and the area they are sitting in the plane is no bigger than the backseat of a taxi. This is real Ed Wood level production values, but old Ed at least imparted some personality to his movies.Second, all of this wouldn't matter so much if the story wasn't so plodding. The problem with many horror movies is the filmmakers have a cool title, but not much idea of what else to do with the movie (think Lunchmeat, Redneck Zombies, and Doctor Butcher, MD [Medical Deviate]). Indeed, the nimrods behind this clunker didn't think much beyond the idea of the press secretary of being a werewolf. In the world of this 1973 toilet raft, full moons are evidently a nightly occurrence in DC, as there is little continuity from scene to scene of Dean Stockwell turning into a werewolf and then wasting some or other Beltway insider in poorly lit night scenes (note to director-film the night scenes during the day with tinted lenses from now on). I suppose you could conceivably figure out how much time elapsed in the movie if you count murders, but generally between them, the president and press secretary are generally kickin' back with a gin & tonic, so I found my attention flagging.Which brings me to my third point, the poor quality of this video. This is one murky, scratched up print that Alpha Video put out. It is pan and scan, and the picture definitely feels clipped.
