840128,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0002MFG8M,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[30, 32]","In 2002's ""&Agrave; cause d'un garon"" (""You'll Get Over It""), 17 year old Vincent (Julien Baumgartner) deals with the aftermath of being ""outed"" at his high school, following an aborted tryst with Benjamin (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie ""Come Undone"" Elkam), the new guy in town.  The graffiti painted near his locker, the taunting from his classmates, the stunned reaction from his parents, even the open hostility from his brother are easier to deal with than being ostracized by the others on the swim team, possibly jeopardizing his getting a college scholarship.  Only one team member remains on his side, while even a teacher believed by students to be gay refuses to help him deal with the reactions.  Vincent explores the local gay scene, and is repulsed by the ""meat market"" atmosphere.  His former girlfriend, No&eacute;mie, tries to be supportive, but eventually decides that she needs to put her own needs first.  In time, his parents rally to let Vincent know he is loved ""as is,"" and enlist the help of his swim coach to overcome the problems with the team.A beautifully photographed and nuanced film made for French TV, depicting a coming out experience that teens can relate to, handled in a realistic and balanced way.  Rated R, with male and female frontal nudity and similated sex.  In French with English subtitles.

840129,A2BRVLLGGLX08G,B0002MFG8M,Cookie Crook,"[17, 18]","You'll Get Over It, directed by Fabrice Cazeneuve, details the life of a swimming champ Vincent (Julien Baumgartner) and his circle of friends Noemae (Julia Maraval) and Ste'phane. Everything in life is going smoothly for Vincent with loving parent, good grades and wonderful friends until Benjamin (Jeremie Elkaim) fumbles out the secret that Vincent is gay. What transpires is the hostility Vincent feels from his swim mates, ex-girlfriend and the loss of control over his life.The acting in this movie is terrific, Julien, Julia and the actor that plays Ste'phane work well together and give convincing and genuine performances of teenagers in a time of change and confusion. The script is well written and delves into the interfaces between Vincent and his friends, school mates, and family; a must for a movie of this caliber. This French film focuses on emotional bonds, character development, and self image/recognition, but doesn't slide into the usual sex, drugs and lunacy that, I hate to say, seems to be so prevalent in American gay movies.

With his best friend Ste'phane and his beautiful girlfriend Noemie (Julia Maraval), high school life couldn't be better for Vincent... until he meets Benjamin (COME UNDONE's Jeremie Elkaim). Vincent keeps crossing paths with the new student, until the two finally have a private moment. The next day, Vincent's idyllic life begins to crumble when the school is vandalized with graffiti labeling him a fag. As the people in his life respond to the news, Vincent faces the inherent challenge of adapting to life as a gay young man. YOU'LL GET OVER IT takes a direct and compassionate look at Vincent's struggle.This is a delightful film. You've seen many similar films, same old story but set in France in a High School swimming team. French with English subtitles. Julien Baumgartner does a great job portraying his character and is also quite nice on the eyes making this film even better. Tastefully done with some nice brief nudity here and there. Most of the acting is very good, and most of the parts were very well cast. Sound and picture quality is very good and I really found no negatives to the film at all. There are a few extras on the DVD, but nothing real special. A photo gallery, scene selections and some coming attractions.

840131,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0002MFG8M,Get What We Give,"[10, 10]","Coming out rarely happens when a boy wants it to, nor is it typically on his own terms. It is usually a result of misplaced trust which is then humiliatingly betrayed and subsequently broadcast for all who would torture the boy. This is exactly what happens in You'll Get Over It (which is not what the French title really is).Vincent is a heck of a swimmer and one of the most popular boys in school. He knows who he is and that he is gay, but he keeps it his own secret to protect himself from the gossip and high school torture that he would endure if it were made public.  Unfortunately, he makes a pass at a boy who, later we find out is actually gay, defends himself by outing Vincent to his friends.The fallout from this is immediate and painful for Vincent.My only problem with this scenario is that Vincent's friends are only too quick to accept the word of a boy that they would abuse regularly. They have not had any indications to this point that Vincent is gay. Why do they so quickly believe this newly transferred outcast boy?With that one little issue aside, the way that this film plays out is quite believable. Vincent's brother outs him to his parents in an effort to gain their favor and respect. It backfires, but Vincent is outted all the same.He loses all his swim team buddies with the exception of his best friend who is a rock of support for him (this was poignantly believable). His girlfriend from whom Vincent took her virginity is believably upset and distraught to learn his news. She vacilates between support and anger - another indication of the believability of the script.Realizing one's sexuality at a young age, in high school - with all of its cliques, is a terribly painful and confusing time. You'll Get Over It explores most of these with great finesse and reality.It's the fairy tale ending that doesn't work for my American sensibility. I understand that it is almost a prerequisite for a French film though.In all, it's a refreshingly nice film that explores a very different avenue in the coming out process. So, when compared to other films of this nature, I'm giving it 4 stars.Check this one out!",4,Worthwhile and realistic coming out portrayal,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,2145,"['Coming', 'out', 'rarely', 'when', 'boy', 'typically', 'own', 'terms', 'usually', 'result', 'misplaced', 'trust', 'then', 'humiliatingly', 'betrayed', 'subsequently', 'broadcast', 'who', 'would', 'torture', 'boy', 'exactly', 'what', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'not', 'what', 'French', 'title', 'really', '.Vincent', 'heck', 'swimmer', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'boys', 'school', 'who', 'gay', 'own', 'secret', 'protect', 'gossip', 'high', 'school', 'torture', 'would', 'endure', 'were', 'made', 'public', 'Unfortunately', 'pass', 'boy', 'who', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'actually', 'gay', 'outing', 'Vincent', 'friends.The', 'fallout', 'immediate', 'painful', 'Vincent.My', 'only', 'problem', 'scenario', 'Vincent', 'friends', 'are', 'only', 'too', 'quick', 'accept', 'word', 'boy', 'would', 'abuse', 'regularly', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'indications', 'point', 'Vincent', 'gay', 'Why', 'do', 'so', 'quickly', 'believe', 'newly', 'transferred', 'outcast', 'boy', 'one', 'little', 'issue', 'aside', 'way', 'film', 'out', 'quite', 'believable', 'Vincent', 'brother', 'parents', 'effort', 'gain', 'favor', 'respect', 'Vincent', 'outted', 'same.He', 'swim', 'team', 'buddies', 'exception', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'rock', 'support', 'was', 'poignantly', 'believable', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'Vincent', 'took', 'virginity', 'believably', 'upset', 'distraught', 'learn', 'news', 'support', 'anger', 'indication', 'believability', 'script.Realizing', 'one', 'sexuality', 'young', 'age', 'high', 'school', 'cliques', 'terribly', 'painful', 'confusing', 'time', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'most', 'great', 'finesse', 'reality.It', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending', ""n't"", 'work', 'American', 'sensibility', 'understand', 'almost', 'prerequisite', 'French', 'film', 'refreshingly', 'nice', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'avenue', 'coming', 'out', 'process', 'So', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'nature', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'stars.Check', 'one', 'out']",You'll Get Over It
840132,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002MFG8M,Grady Harp,"[6, 9]","YOU'LL GET OVER IT is a very French film: the moods of sensitivity, fresh teenage sexuality, and mature adult perspectives make it so much different than the usual film about gender identification.  Fabrice Cazeneuve directs a strong cast with just the right amount of balance within the high school age sexual duplicity and in doing so makes this otherwise somewhat overexposed story idea special.Vincent (Julien Baumgartner making an impressive debut) is a 17 year old role model: he is handsome, intelligent, popular, the champion of the swimming team, and a good son.  Problem: Vincent is gay, but hiding in the closet, having trysts in private while still participating in a near menage a trois with his close friends Noemie (Julia Maraval) and Stephane (Francoise Comar).  Vincent manages to walk the tightrope until new student Benjamin (Jeramie Elkaim) enrolls, a boy everyone knows is gay and whose budding friendship with Vincent alerts the world that Vincent must also be gay.  Vincent is mocked, has difficulty with the swim team, has his first heterosexual affair with Noemie, is first exposure to the seamier side of gay bars, and eventually is forced to reveal his identity. How his parents Patrick Bonel and Christiane Millet) slowly become supportive with the help of swim coach (Bernard Blancon), teacher (Eric Bonicatto), and straight friend Bruno (Nils Ohlund) and all play significant parts in Vincent's sexual dilemma.The film is light but addresses issues of prejudice that are worldwide in a manner both tender and mature.  This is an excellent film for the general public who want insights into the gay question. In French with English subtitles.

840133,A1X1RWRPSAL206,B0002MFG8M,"interested_observer ""interested_observer""","[79, 82]","""You'll Get Over It"" is a fine French made-for-TV movie showing how coming out affects an individual and those closest to him.  Vincent Molina (played by Julien Baumgartner) is the 17-year old anchor of the school swimming relay team, is about to graduate, and is a closeted gay.  He has a long-time, virgin girlfriend, Noemie (played by Julia Maraval), and a non-virgin 'buddy', Bruno (played by Nils Ohlund).  This works out until Vincent hooks up with a new student, Benjamin (played by Jeremie Elkaim of ""Come Undone"").  People know Benjamin is gay and make the link to Vincent, who has had a compartmented life.  The movie shows how Vincent and those closest to him deal with their emotions as the situation plays out.Vincent's initial withdrawal and distrustfulness are very realistically shown.  The uncertainty and bargaining of his friends and family come through well.  The acting is good thoughout.There is considerable skin shown, from all of Vincent to Noemie to the swimmers and locker-room denizens.While the movie centers on Vincent and his long-time network, I would have liked a stronger sense of how Bruno fit into Vincent's worldview and on why Benjamin and Vincent make a good fit.  Jeremie Elkaim does not get much time on screen, despite his top billing and a good performance.  The bonus features are just a picture gallery and some trailers.I have noticed that recent French movies on a gay theme have been substantially better than their American counterparts.  ""You'll Get over It"", ""Close to Leo"", ""The Man I Love"", ""Confusion of Genders"", ""My Life on Ice"", ""Come Undone"", and other movies all seem to have more depth of characterization and more willingness to reveal emotions, sexuality, and the human body than, say, ""A Home at the End of the World"".You'll enjoy watching ""You'll Get Over It"".",4,Everyone Adapts In His Or Her Own Way,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,1824,"[""'ll"", 'Get', 'fine', 'French', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'showing', 'how', 'coming', 'out', 'affects', 'individual', 'closest', 'Vincent', 'Molina', 'played', 'Julien', 'Baumgartner', '17-year', 'old', 'anchor', 'school', 'swimming', 'relay', 'team', 'graduate', 'closeted', 'gay', 'long-time', 'virgin', 'girlfriend', 'Noemie', 'played', 'Julia', 'Maraval', 'non-virgin', ""'buddy"", 'Bruno', 'played', 'Nils', 'Ohlund', 'out', 'Vincent', 'up', 'new', 'student', 'Benjamin', 'played', 'Jeremie', 'Elkaim', 'Come', 'Undone', 'People', 'know', 'Benjamin', 'gay', 'make', 'link', 'Vincent', 'who', 'had', 'compartmented', 'life', 'movie', 'how', 'Vincent', 'closest', 'deal', 'emotions', 'situation', 'out.Vincent', 'initial', 'withdrawal', 'distrustfulness', 'are', 'very', 'realistically', 'shown', 'uncertainty', 'bargaining', 'friends', 'family', 'come', 'through', 'well', 'acting', 'good', 'considerable', 'skin', 'shown', 'Vincent', 'Noemie', 'swimmers', 'locker-room', 'movie', 'centers', 'Vincent', 'long-time', 'network', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'stronger', 'sense', 'how', 'Bruno', 'fit', 'Vincent', 'worldview', 'why', 'Benjamin', 'Vincent', 'make', 'good', 'fit', 'Jeremie', 'Elkaim', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'time', 'screen', 'top', 'billing', 'good', 'performance', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'picture', 'gallery', 'trailers.I', 'have', 'noticed', 'recent', 'French', 'movies', 'gay', 'theme', 'have', 'been', 'substantially', 'better', 'American', 'counterparts', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'Close', 'Leo', 'Man', 'Love', 'Confusion', 'Genders', 'Life', 'Ice', 'Come', 'Undone', 'other', 'movies', 'seem', 'have', 'more', 'depth', 'characterization', 'more', 'willingness', 'reveal', 'emotions', 'sexuality', 'human', 'body', 'say', 'Home', 'End', 'World', '.You', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'Get']",You'll Get Over It
840134,A3SIJ2IXS7EGS2,B0002MFG8M,Jerome Y. Hebert,"[1, 1]","I have little to add to the many insightful reviews of this charming and very well acted addition to the canon of French-language ""coming out"" films......Except for one aspect of the DVD presentation that I think may be worth mentioning and which is the only reason that I can't give it five stars:  the often even-more-ghastly-than-usual subtitles.  I've seldom seen such a succession of stilted (and sometimes downright grotesque) ""translations"" of French dialogue.  (Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to turn the little devils off, should one be so inclined...a polite suggestion perhaps that such an option might be much appreciated even by purchasers in Region 1?)  Viewers of this film who understand spoken French will, in my opinion, find it *far* more rewarding and enjoyable than those who have to rely on the often jarring ""interpretations"" of the dialogue suggested by the subtitles.But, fortunately, even the (imo) most tortured of the subtitles can't derail the excellent performances or the satisfying evolution of Vincent's ""dilemma.""  So, with that one negative criticism, I heartily recommend this film, as have most of the reviewers here.  It offers innocence and the blush of young romance, but is powerful and intelligent; it presents a sympathetic and rational perspective on coming out, but doesn't shy away from some of the harsh and irrational realities that can and do confront a young Gay man and his friends during the process.  Individuals who enjoy a European approach to Gay films will, I believe, definitely appreciate this one and be very satisfied in adding it to their collection.

When Vincent is seen ""consorting"" with a suspected gay student, all hell breaks loose and Vincent is forced to deal with not only the reactions of those around him but the roiling emotions taking place deep within himself about what exactly it means to be gay.Although the film feels a little too pat, contrived and melodramatic at times - kind of like an After School Special with subtitles and occasional flashes of nudity - ""You'll Get Over It"" wins us over with the delicacy, insight and compassion it brings to its subject.  It shows us the myriad and sometimes surprising reactions from the people in Vincent's life - his parents, his ""girlfriend,"" his best friend, his team mates, his swim coach and his teachers.  The amount of outright persecution Vincent has to endure from his fellow students shows that even France - so often thought of as being in the forefront of all things sexual - has a long way to go in accepting gays.  The movie also deals with Vincent's own conflicting feelings about being gay, as he contemplates a future filled with what he imagines to be loneliness and unhappiness.  Like many gay people, Vincent lives in as much of a state of denial at times as the people around him.The performances are excellent, particularly those by Julien Baumgartner as Vincent and Julia Maravel as Noemie, the girl who loves him and wants to help him, but who finds it hard to let go of him even after she discovers the truth.  Baumgartner has a very expressive face that allows us to understand and identify with the external and internal struggles taking place in his character's life.For the most part, ""You'll Get Over It"" has a nice, naturalistic feel to it.  Director Fabrice Cazeneuve keeps his camera largely handheld and close to the actors, which heightens the sense of realism and intimacy this type of story needs to be effective.  Unfortunately, the plot mechanics do intrude a bit from time to time, and the ending, while touching, does feel a little too conveniently upbeat to be entirely convincing.  Still, ""You'll Get Over It"" serves as a valuable plea for understanding and acceptance, and that is a salutary goal for any film.",3,generally appealing coming-of-age film,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,2586,"['***1/2A', 'sensitive', 'film', 'coming', 'out', 'coming', 'age', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'tells', '17-year-old', 'French', 'boy', 'efforts', 'deal', 'homosexuality', 'championship', 'swimmer', 'Vincent', 'popular', 'well-liked', 'kid', 'school', 'apple', 'parents', 'eyes', 'home', 'problem', 'Vincent', 'living', 'lie', 'keeping', 'sexuality', 'secret', 'family', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'world', 'large', 'When', 'Vincent', 'seen', 'consorting', 'suspected', 'gay', 'student', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Vincent', 'forced', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'reactions', 'roiling', 'emotions', 'taking', 'place', 'deep', 'what', 'exactly', 'be', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'contrived', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'kind', 'School', 'Special', 'subtitles', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'nudity', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'delicacy', 'insight', 'compassion', 'subject', 'myriad', 'sometimes', 'surprising', 'reactions', 'people', 'Vincent', 'life', 'parents', 'girlfriend', 'best', 'friend', 'team', 'mates', 'swim', 'coach', 'teachers', 'amount', 'outright', 'persecution', 'Vincent', 'endure', 'fellow', 'students', 'even', 'France', 'so', 'often', 'thought', 'being', 'forefront', 'things', 'sexual', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'accepting', 'gays', 'movie', 'also', 'Vincent', 'own', 'conflicting', 'feelings', 'being', 'gay', 'future', 'filled', 'what', 'be', 'loneliness', 'unhappiness', 'many', 'gay', 'people', 'Vincent', 'as', 'much', 'state', 'denial', 'times', 'people', 'him.The', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'Julien', 'Baumgartner', 'Vincent', 'Julia', 'Maravel', 'Noemie', 'girl', 'who', 'help', 'who', 'hard', 'let', 'go', 'even', 'truth', 'Baumgartner', 'very', 'expressive', 'face', 'understand', 'identify', 'external', 'internal', 'struggles', 'taking', 'place', 'character', 'most', 'part', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'nice', 'naturalistic', 'feel', 'Director', 'Fabrice', 'Cazeneuve', 'camera', 'largely', 'handheld', 'close', 'actors', 'sense', 'realism', 'intimacy', 'type', 'story', 'needs', 'be', 'effective', 'Unfortunately', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'do', 'intrude', 'bit', 'time', 'time', 'ending', 'touching', 'feel', 'little', 'too', 'conveniently', 'upbeat', 'be', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'Still', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'valuable', 'plea', 'understanding', 'acceptance', 'salutary', 'goal', 'film']",You'll Get Over It
840139,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0002MFG8M,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","This is a French film made for TV but despite that is rather superior in most respects. It is a coming out tale but not one that is often dealt with. This is about Vincent, he is seventeen and a role model to his school mainly because he is the super cool best swimmer in their team. With an expanding coterie of female admirers and the devotion of best mate Stephane he also has a relationship with Neomie, she is madly in heart with him and he does nowt to dissuade her - quite the reverse in fact, the little tyke.He also has a lover, whom he has to invent lies to be with. He lives at home with over caring and doting mum, a socialist father and an elder brother who is unemployed and a bit of a tosser. Things come to a head (forgive the awful pun) when a new bloke turns up and takes an instant shine to Vincent. What happens next is a tale of betrayal, humiliation, family let down and a whole caboodle of grief for Vincent. At one stage his boyfriend says, that it is not his fault he can not come out to his mum. Well some do need a hand and others just can't wait or it is obvious, either way people should be allowed to choose.I thought this was one of the best screen displays of just how homophobic society can be, and it is often justified by them saying things like `why didn't you tell me?' The idea that every conversation has to start with a declaration of your sexual orientation has always struck me as strange when heterosexuals never are expected to do it. Still I digress, I absolutely loved this film, I found it well acted, engrossing and for a made for TV effort the camera work and production standards were exceptionally good. The issues are dealt with in the shock therapy way, that often accompanies the news that your beloved son is not likely to be providing grand children, but has great taste in clothes and can dance like a disco pro. Still stereo types aside, this is one that any fans of gay cinema will want to see and well done Peccadillo for resurrecting it, not much in the bedroom department though but it does not suffer for that - recommended.",4,`When You're Living a Lie You're Trapped',1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,2087,"['French', 'film', 'made', 'TV', 'rather', 'superior', 'most', 'respects', 'coming', 'out', 'tale', 'not', 'one', 'often', 'dealt', 'Vincent', 'seventeen', 'role', 'model', 'school', 'mainly', 'super', 'cool', 'best', 'swimmer', 'team', 'expanding', 'coterie', 'female', 'admirers', 'devotion', 'best', 'mate', 'Stephane', 'also', 'relationship', 'Neomie', 'madly', 'heart', 'nowt', 'dissuade', 'quite', 'reverse', 'fact', 'little', 'tyke.He', 'also', 'lover', 'whom', 'invent', 'lies', 'be', 'home', 'caring', 'doting', 'mum', 'socialist', 'father', 'elder', 'brother', 'who', 'unemployed', 'bit', 'tosser', 'Things', 'come', 'head', 'forgive', 'awful', 'pun', 'when', 'new', 'bloke', 'up', 'instant', 'shine', 'Vincent', 'What', 'next', 'tale', 'betrayal', 'humiliation', 'family', 'let', 'down', 'whole', 'caboodle', 'grief', 'Vincent', 'one', 'stage', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'fault', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'mum', 'Well', 'do', 'need', 'hand', 'others', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'obvious', 'way', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'choose.I', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'screen', 'displays', 'just', 'how', 'homophobic', 'society', 'can', 'be', 'often', 'justified', 'saying', 'things', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'idea', 'conversation', 'start', 'declaration', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'always', 'struck', 'strange', 'when', 'heterosexuals', 'never', 'are', 'expected', 'do', 'Still', 'digress', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'film', 'found', 'well', 'acted', 'engrossing', 'made', 'TV', 'effort', 'camera', 'work', 'production', 'standards', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'issues', 'are', 'dealt', 'shock', 'therapy', 'way', 'often', 'news', 'beloved', 'son', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'providing', 'grand', 'children', 'great', 'taste', 'clothes', 'can', 'dance', 'disco', 'pro', 'Still', 'stereo', 'types', 'aside', 'one', 'fans', 'gay', 'cinema', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'well', 'done', 'Peccadillo', 'resurrecting', 'not', 'much', 'bedroom', 'department', 'not', 'suffer', 'recommended']",You'll Get Over It

Coming out was the only topic throughout the entire movie, it didn't include sub-plots like other gay movies it was just one story and that might have bored the movie down. Overall, I figured the movie to be lacking the intensity that other gay coming out stories involve but this one was just bleh. Everything was presented as if the main actor lived in Disneyland- he was outed, everyone believed the rumor, his parents found out, his girlfriend accepted and they all went about their life as if noting happened. He was accepted by his parents, his girlfriend still loved him, his best male friend still wanted to be his pal (which was a good point) the coach still treated him the same it was as if this story could be taking place in 2100 when being gay is just like global warming- everyone will eventually forget it's a problem and accept it. In the end all the stories concluded themselves, no one got shot, no one died and no one got hurt pretty good feel good movie if you want to come out and need some help.",4,Pretty Basic.,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,1081,"['movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'basic', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'Coming', 'out', 'was', 'only', 'topic', 'entire', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'sub-plots', 'other', 'gay', 'movies', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'bored', 'movie', 'down', 'Overall', 'figured', 'movie', 'be', 'lacking', 'intensity', 'other', 'gay', 'coming', 'out', 'stories', 'involve', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'bleh', 'Everything', 'was', 'presented', 'main', 'actor', 'lived', 'Disneyland-', 'was', 'outed', 'everyone', 'believed', 'rumor', 'parents', 'found', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'accepted', 'went', 'life', 'noting', 'happened', 'was', 'accepted', 'parents', 'girlfriend', 'still', 'loved', 'best', 'male', 'friend', 'still', 'wanted', 'be', 'pal', 'was', 'good', 'point', 'coach', 'still', 'treated', 'same', 'was', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'taking', 'place', '2100', 'when', 'being', 'gay', 'just', 'like', 'global', 'warming-', 'everyone', 'will', 'eventually', 'forget', 'problem', 'accept', 'end', 'stories', 'concluded', 'one', 'got', 'shot', 'one', 'died', 'one', 'got', 'hurt', 'pretty', 'good', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'want', 'come', 'out', 'need', 'help']",You'll Get Over It
