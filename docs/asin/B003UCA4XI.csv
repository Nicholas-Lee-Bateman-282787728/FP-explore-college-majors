John Schneider was the only good acting that I could see.  It was a shame that the message was so good, but didn't come off well.  The &#34;bad guy&#34; character was a charade and &#34;too&#34; phoney &#34;bad&#34;.  There wasn't any realness to most of the characters.  The fact that they chose a woman to be the &#34;good&#34; mayor bothered me.  Good and godly male leaders is what we need in this world (of course, that's just my personal feeling that I would have liked to have seen in the movie).On a side note, I watched a movie called &#34;Radio&#34; that caught the realness and godliness of living for others.

It is decent, and honest, a movie inspiring us to follow God through the example of his son Jesus.There are several different characters in the movie, of many different types of people,  following the ambitions of their own soul. This changes when a poor, jobless, homeless man who was badly treated by almost everyone in the town steps upon the platform at the end of a service where the Pastor is telling the church he is leaving and the church will be torn down and rebuilt elsewhere so a casino can be put on it's sight. The poor man tells the people how badly he was treated ,and he couldn't help wonder what Jesus would have done, then falls out cold on the floor of the church.This so touches the peoples hearts and minds, that it motivates them to act, and fight to keep the church, and live a life that is pleasing to God in helping others, and not just pleasing ourselves.You can't help but fall in love with all the players.It is a great family movie teaching all to value the call of God on their lives.I would recommend it to every one that calls themselvesa Christian.

1363422,AMSALM0GG880Q,B003UCA4XI,Hawk911,"[0, 0]","Christian movies frequently suffer from flat, one dimensional stories that only appeal to so-called Christians while the rest of the world sees them coming a mile away and instantly reject before ever given a chance.  Not exactly so for this one. This movie grapples some tough, real-world challenges and does a good job despite not having the luxury of a big budget or high-paid Hollywood actors.The movie was no doubt brought to fruition by dedicated people trying to bring an important message to the world and they succeeded.  The movie uses such cinematic elements as decent lighting techniques for skin tone and shadows and even a few jib/crane shots. Some critics belittle the acting but overall the characters are well represented.John Schneider delivers an outstanding portrayal of a poor homeless man who clearly is a disciple and messenger of God. He enters a spiritually starving and economically crumbling town on the verge of worsenng yet more at the hands of a corrupt politician mis-leading people towards a false solution. Though outwardly poor, the hitchhiker is inwardly blessed with God's grace and mission to spread the truth and hope of Jesus to people ranging from homeless to wealthy who despite their financial status are all starving for the real answer. He is coldly shunned by everyone in the town, including the greedy, the common man, the wealthy, the church-goers who call themselves Christians and even the Christians who are weak in following God.  Before collapsing before them in church, with no resent he humbly calls them to account asking what it really means to follow Jesus and what makes one kind of man less worth saving than another?  Then he challenges, &#34;when you find yourself struggling with life's difficult decisions, ask yourself one simple question - what would Jesus do?&#34;The message shakes the congregation leading them to question the true condition of their hearts and realize they are all either self-righteous hypocrites, lost or have wandered from God.This is where the movie falls a little weak. The message is not made clear enough as to what it takes to really change a heart. If not careful it can easily be thought that all we need to do is to try harder to be better people and help each other. But a fundamental life change and ability to really do what Jesus wants can only be achieved when we submit to God and seek his guidance and strength.The hitchhiker best demonstrates this by meeting each challenge and confrontation armed with scripture because his life and strength come from his walk with God. The hopeless pastor briefly prays twice for God's help, but the other characters change of heart are pretty much left unexplained.  They transform quickly from cold and uncaring to remorseful and kind. The real estate lady confesses her wrongs were &#34;before she asked Jesus into her life&#34; so there is a faint message there, but the movie almost borders at a point on being a G-rated family movie where they all lived happily ever after without doing justice to what it took to cause such a revival. It would have required more screen time but a simple prayer of repentence and receiving salvation would have helped make a powerful statement in showing their change of heart.Because of this it seems that most of the characters are supposed to be lukewarm or downright cold Christians who just plain don't follow God until their conscious is charged and they then band together to do good. Either way the message is a positive one. I just wish they had more carefully and powerfully crafted and demonstrated it for greater effectiveness.However, to be fair the movie takes on a lot of life's difficulties by use of it's many characters who deal with disastrous loss of loved ones, loss of faith, moral struggles at the cost of financial security and more. It even shows the world's frequent reception to followers of Jesus with the characters being laughed at, criticized, called &#34;Jesus freaks&#34; and reminded that they aren't Jesus in an effort to discourage them.

Major life circumstances happen to these people who attend the same congregation and they give up on serving God from their hearts. A homeless man asks for help from the members of the congregation at different times and is rejected in many ways.The scriptural foundation of this movie film for me was 1 Peter 5, which was mentioned throughout the film. John Schneider played the homeless man/prophetic visitor and did an excellent job. The music by Adam Gregory was very touching to me and gets a very important point across about what Jesus would do in the same situations that the congregation members faced.This is one film that all Jesus-following congregations should benefit from. It really can make people think about why they would want to be a follower of Jesus at all if they don't want to do what Jesus would do. I believe it would be a great film to watch with congregation members of all ages who have not learned how to treat people the way that Jesus would in different situations such as homelessness, sickness, loss, etc. I believe it would also be a great film for people to watch who already understand how to treat people in these ways but need a refresher and want to learn ways to put what have learned into action.",5,Makes You Think About if You Are Truly Acting Like a Jesus-Follower,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,1335,"['WWJD', 'What', 'Would', 'Jesus', 'Do', 'people', 'town', 'act', 'have', 'faith', 'left', 'Major', 'life', 'circumstances', 'happen', 'people', 'who', 'attend', 'same', 'congregation', 'give', 'up', 'serving', 'God', 'hearts', 'homeless', 'man', 'help', 'members', 'congregation', 'different', 'times', 'rejected', 'many', 'ways.The', 'scriptural', 'foundation', 'movie', 'film', 'was', '1', 'Peter', '5', 'was', 'mentioned', 'film', 'John', 'Schneider', 'played', 'homeless', 'man/prophetic', 'visitor', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'music', 'Adam', 'Gregory', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'very', 'important', 'point', 'what', 'Jesus', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'situations', 'congregation', 'members', 'faced.This', 'one', 'film', 'Jesus-following', 'congregations', 'should', 'benefit', 'really', 'can', 'make', 'people', 'think', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'follower', 'Jesus', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'what', 'Jesus', 'would', 'do', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'congregation', 'members', 'ages', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'learned', 'how', 'treat', 'people', 'way', 'Jesus', 'would', 'different', 'situations', 'such', 'homelessness', 'sickness', 'loss', 'etc', 'believe', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'people', 'watch', 'who', 'already', 'understand', 'how', 'treat', 'people', 'ways', 'need', 'refresher', 'want', 'learn', 'ways', 'put', 'what', 'have', 'learned', 'action']",Wwjd - What Would Jesus Do?
