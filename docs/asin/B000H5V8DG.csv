1010285,A2NZ6ZFXDD48P7,B000H5V8DG,Athenaeus Alexander Dukas,"[20, 26]","The concept/problem with the Collector's Edition Alias Series Box Set are both highly similar to those of the series when looked at as a whole: Full of a rare beauty and promise that ULTIMATELY would get trashed by cheapness, laziness, and incompetence.This Set SHOULD have been the crowning addition to any serious dramatist's collection -- 'cause no one does it better than Alias when it's running on all cylinders -- but the ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS disc sleeve packaging delivered all 20-something discs to my door horribly scratched on not one but on two orders.  The packaging concept was terrific and it's REALLY too bad that the people that conceived the design for the packaging obviously have yet to realize that discs need protection from scratching as much as they need it from spindle-jumping impacts.As a series, despite the legions of Season 3, Season 4, and Season 5 naysayers, the show (mostly evenly) managed to hold it's own until the very last two episodes of the series which effectively betrayed the Bristows, the fans, and the all-important Mother-Father-Daughter SpyFamily Magic which made the show so emotionally resonant, beautiful, and heartbreaking.  Only emotionally crippled men who find ""depth"" in Mission Impossible, Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade, and The Empire Strikes Back will be truly happy with the mechanics of the ending though the Sydney and Vaughn storyline is laid to rest well.  Beyond that, rabid fan dissatisfaction may  also be the REAL reason why none of the series heavy-hitters provided commentary for the final episodes in the Season 5 DVD's.All this shouldn't come as a surprise... J.J. Abrams is notorious for commiting mass character assassination/genocide in the twilight days of his stories which is why (after Alias) I'll never watch another show he produces.PLEASE NOTE: DUE TO CONSUMER OUTRAGE OVER THEIR DISC DAMAGING DEFECTIVE PRODUCT PACKAGING BUENA VISTA IS NOW REPLACING THE DISCS OF THIS SET FREE OF CHARGE...

Sydney's character, however fragile and weak its made out to be, is actually quite well drawn out with all the other characters, from Vaughn to her sister Nadia, I found it all quite made and certainly worth the watch.However, my only gripe was the way it was made, was it me or did anyone notice the HUGE build up to the middle of every episode with some impossible mission to accomplish? I found this quite tiresome and expecting, and actually I found myself fowarding through most of them after about three seasons of it. The narrow escaping and fighting off numerous security guards/ extras became almost too boring for me, but made me want to focus on the rest of the story because of it.

1010288,A33G2XG1S5NSH1,B000H5V8DG,"Bryant Burnette ""Bryant Burnette""","[62, 80]","This set looks to be a terrific investment for people who loved ""Alias"" and don'y yet own any of the DVD sets.  For people who've been purchasing the DVDs all along, it looks like a mixed bag.  Additional special features have been promised, but will they be worth the price tag?  Probably not.  Expect prices on used individual season sets to plummet soon.As for the series itself, well, I'm forced to say it's a mixed bag, too.  It never, thankfully, turned into a bad series, but I think that the last couple of seasons were inadequate, and failed to deliver on the promise of the seasons that came before them.Seasons one and two, in my opinion, would have to rank as amongst the finest single seasons of TV ever produced.  Those 40-plus episodes are relentlessly excellent, beginning to end, and sometimes seem more like movies than TV episodes.Many critics and fans disparaged season three, calling it ""convoluted"" or the like.  Personally, I found it pretty terrific.  For the most part, it flows almost like a single long story.  It must have been difficult for some people to keep up with what was going on week after week as these episodes were airing; in any case, this is not a problem on DVD.Season four represents a major step down, in my opinion.  Again, it doesn't become bad at ANY point . . . but certain storylines vanish, other hard-to-credit storylines crop up, and every time it seems as if something really great and meaningful is about to happen, the story takes a sharp left turn and goes somewhere less interesting for two or three episodes.Season five is better, featuring at least two excellent new characters.  Things really pick up toward the very end of the season, until the quality level is almost at the same peaks it was in the first two seasons.Unfortunately, for me, the series finale was fairly weak.  Some of the series's major plot points are resolved, some very poorly in my opinion; others are not resolved at all.  Many fans seem to disagree with me, of course, and in the end it's going to be a matter of personal taste.  But even if you hate the way the series ends, this is a box set well worth having.",4,"frequently brilliant, ultimately deeply flawed",1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,2148,"['set', 'be', 'terrific', 'investment', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'Alias', 'don', 'y', 'yet', 'own', 'DVD', 'sets', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'purchasing', 'DVDs', 'along', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Additional', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'been', 'promised', 'will', 'be', 'price', 'tag', 'Probably', 'not', 'Expect', 'prices', 'used', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'plummet', 'soon.As', 'series', 'well', ""'m"", 'forced', 'say', 'mixed', 'bag', 'too', 'never', 'thankfully', 'turned', 'bad', 'series', 'think', 'last', 'couple', 'seasons', 'were', 'inadequate', 'failed', 'deliver', 'promise', 'seasons', 'came', 'them.Seasons', 'one', 'two', 'opinion', 'would', 'have', 'rank', 'amongst', 'finest', 'single', 'seasons', 'TV', 'ever', 'produced', '40-plus', 'episodes', 'are', 'relentlessly', 'excellent', 'beginning', 'end', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'more', 'movies', 'TV', 'episodes.Many', 'critics', 'fans', 'disparaged', 'season', 'three', 'calling', 'convoluted', 'like', 'Personally', 'found', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'most', 'part', 'almost', 'single', 'long', 'story', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'people', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'week', 'week', 'episodes', 'were', 'airing', 'case', 'not', 'problem', 'DVD.Season', 'four', 'major', 'step', 'down', 'opinion', 'Again', ""n't"", 'become', 'bad', 'ANY', 'point', 'certain', 'storylines', 'vanish', 'other', 'hard-to-credit', 'storylines', 'crop', 'up', 'time', 'something', 'really', 'great', 'meaningful', 'happen', 'story', 'sharp', 'left', 'turn', 'somewhere', 'less', 'interesting', 'two', 'three', 'episodes.Season', 'five', 'better', 'featuring', 'least', 'two', 'excellent', 'new', 'characters', 'Things', 'really', 'pick', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'season', 'quality', 'level', 'almost', 'same', 'peaks', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.Unfortunately', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'fairly', 'weak', 'series', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'resolved', 'very', 'poorly', 'opinion', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'resolved', 'Many', 'fans', 'seem', 'disagree', 'course', 'end', 'going', 'be', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste', 'even', 'hate', 'way', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'well', 'worth', 'having']",Alias - The Complete Collection

For me, it is right up there with shows like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""My So-Called Life"", which also had strong, charismatic female leads. What makes ""Alias"" such a terrific show is not just the concept of Jennifer Garner kicking [...] in flattering disguises. There is also the fact that the storylines are so complex and creative that the show is bordering on science fiction, yet they are interlaced with heartwarming and very real, human moments (which seems to be J.J. Abrams specialty), not to mention the outstanding performances not only by Jennifer Garner herself, but also the show's two extremely talented lead actors, Victor Garber (Jack) and Ron Rifkin (Sloane).

1010291,A278AF56R7J86,B000H5V8DG,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[6, 8]","Alias is a show that has captivated audiences since it's very beginning when it exploded onto the screen and into our lives. J.J. Abrams, the genius/creator of 'Alias', managed to bring a big-screen feel to a small-screen television show. The gadgets and special effects are incredible, and there are so many twists and turns in the storytelling that it would make your head spin. The show constantly keeps you guessing, and J.J. is the master at cliff-hanger endings, which he used profusely throughout the majority of the 1st and 2nd seasons.Jennifer Garner turns in a stellar performance as Sydney Bristow, a spy who works for SD-6, a company she was told was a black ops division of the CIA. However, Sydney soon learns the truth after SD-6 has her fiance killed when they realize she has told him about her life as a spy. SD-6 isn't part of the CIA...in fact, they are a branch of a world-wide terrorist organization that deals in weapons, technology, and intelligence trade. Sydney contacts the real CIA and becomes a double-agent in an effort to bring down the alliance of SD cells all over the world. She vows to destroy the people who lied to her, manipulated her, and destroyed her life. Her only ally is another double-agent within SD-6...her father.The show was nothing short of breathtaking during it's first two seasons. It's third season was engaging and exciting, but a slightly noticable decline could be seen, and a less than exciting character was introduced...Nadia, Sydney's long lost half-sister. I felt that the entire Nadia storyline and character was a giant step in the wrong direction, and it only got worse when the sub-par 4th season arrived. J.J.'s brilliant cliff-hanger endings were all but abandoned, which sucked much of the excitement and thrill out of the show. Another hugely terrible mistep by the writers was their abandonment of the Rambaldi storyline. The Rambaldi mystery was one of the reasons fans were begging for more, and with each new revelation a tiny piece of the puzzle came together. How could they simply abandon that?I must say that I shouldn't place all the blame on the writers alone. According to interviews, it was pressure from the network which forced the show to move away from Rambaldi. Network execs didn't like the trans-seasonal Rambaldi story arc, and they never did. They pressured J.J. and the writers to get rid of it and come up with something else. Little did they know, the fans turned out to be Rambaldi loyalists, and it was eventually brought back into play.The 5th and final season made strides to recover what they had lost during the disappointing 4th season, but they were limited by Jennifer Garner's pregnancy and, in my opinion, personal issues. It was the shortest season yet, due largely to her pregnancy, and a well-loved character, Michael Vaughn (played by Michael Vartan), was gone during most of the season. Jennifer Garner and Michael Vartan dated for a while before she abruptly broke it off to date (and eventually marry) Ben Affleck. I think the tension on the set was too uncomfortable for her...hence Vaughns disappearance during most of season 5. Thats just my opinion though.This box set is cool beyond reason. The artifact box alone is an 'Alias' collectors dream. In addition to all 5 seasons of the show, you get a small book in which the writers, directors, and actors briefly discuss important aspects of the show, with little anecdotes (like who 'deepthroat' was in season 1), to frequently asked questions (like is that really Sydney depicted on page 47 of the Rambaldi manuscript? Does Irina really love Jack and Sydney?), and it even discusses storylines the writers had hoped would make it into the show, but never did (in a word...Irina). It's a neat little read, and fans will enjoy it.Despite my misgivings regarding the abyssmal season 4, I would recommend this show to anyone. If you have been collecting the individual seasons over time, it may not be worth it to you to re-purchase them in this complete collection...but it was worth it to me.

1010294,A2XKL41AMO0FI,B000H5V8DG,Grant Frimble,"[13, 15]","Alias- by far one of the best shows on television. It may not have been a huge hit, but this show had everything. It was dramatic, sad, fun, entertaining, and very shocking.Season One showed Sydney as the happy-go-lucky super spy. She finds out that the people she had been working for have been lying to her, so she goes to the CIA and becomes a double agent. She's forced to build a relationship with her father, who she hasn't talked to for seven years. She must deal with having to go back to the agency that lied to her and pretend like nothing has changed - they aren't aloud to know the truth about her. She must deal with lying to the man she hates the most, Arvin Sloane, and feel the guilt of having to lie to her unknowing and trustworthy partner, Dixon (who is also being lied to). Sydney is forced to deal with all these things while also having to go on missions and stop the people who make the world dangerous. Season One also introduces Rambaldi, a prophet who made artifacts that people are obsessed with collecting (in order to find out his ultimate mystery) Season One is spectacular from it's phenominal pilot, to it's heart-pounding finale.Season Two starts right where Season One ends. The premiere gives the closure that the viewers where waiting for, but opened up many more questions to be answered. In this season Sydney is forced to work with someone she never thought she would see again, take down the evil people who lied to her, deal with her personal life meshing with her spy life, tracking down her enemy, Sloane and her forbidden love with a co-worker. Season Two is full of family drama and heartening moments. The second half of the season explodes with plot twists and interesting moments. The jaw-droping season finale leaves the viewer speechless and highly anticipating the next season.Season Three starts again right where the second season left off. This season is very difficult for Sydney. She is forced to deal with losing multiple friends and family memebers. Sydney has to start anew and rebuild what she once had. She is forced to ally herself with the evil Sloane and must think about if people are capable of change. She meets a woman who puts a damper on her love life and is forced to work with her and be polite. The Rambaldi mystery is very thick in the second half of the season, revealing many answers, but, in common Alias style, opening up more questions. The end of the season has betrayal and an addition to the spy family tree. Season Three's shocking finale ends by ripping apart everything Sydney knew, leaving her unable to trust anyone she thought she could.Season four picks up about a month after season three ended. Sydney finally ends up quitting the CIA. Shortly after we realize that her 'quitting' was a ruse. She is now working for an undercover organization in the CIA. Sydney needs to deal with working with people she thought she would never have to see again, the same people who betrayed her. She also finds out that someone else may have betrayed her, not the people she thought. In season four Sydney rebuilds trust with those she thought she could never speak to again as well as a bond with someone she didn't even know existed. Rambaldi is unheard of in the first half of the season but by the second half he resurfaces. By the end of the season Sydney must be off saving the world. Finally, after all is well, and Sydney finally thinks that her world is in order, she gets the shock of a lifetime when the one person she thought she could trust tells her that he hasn't been completely honest with her.Season Five, the final season of Alias, begins right where the fourth season left us. In the shocking premiere Sydney is forced to deal with even more hardship when she loses someone close to her. Her life gets even harder when she finds out that she is pregnant. Now, she must find who caused her to lose her close friend. Sydney allys herself with criminals and anyone who is willing to help. Secrets are revealed and true intentions resurface. The best moment of this season is the series finale. It is the perfect closing to the perfect show.As the other review said, it is hard to say much without spoiling the surprise, but I hope this rather lengthy review helped.",5,Best Show I've Ever Seen,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,4259,"['Alias-', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'hit', 'show', 'had', 'everything', 'was', 'dramatic', 'sad', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'very', 'shocking.Season', 'One', 'showed', 'Sydney', 'happy-go-lucky', 'super', 'spy', 'out', 'people', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'have', 'been', 'lying', 'CIA', 'double', 'agent', 'forced', 'build', 'relationship', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'talked', 'seven', 'years', 'must', 'deal', 'having', 'go', 'back', 'agency', 'lied', 'pretend', 'nothing', 'changed', 'are', ""n't"", 'aloud', 'know', 'truth', 'must', 'deal', 'lying', 'man', 'most', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'feel', 'guilt', 'having', 'lie', 'unknowing', 'trustworthy', 'partner', 'Dixon', 'who', 'also', 'being', 'lied', 'Sydney', 'forced', 'deal', 'things', 'also', 'having', 'go', 'missions', 'stop', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'world', 'dangerous', 'Season', 'One', 'also', 'Rambaldi', 'prophet', 'who', 'made', 'artifacts', 'people', 'are', 'obsessed', 'collecting', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'ultimate', 'mystery', 'Season', 'One', 'spectacular', 'phenominal', 'pilot', 'heart-pounding', 'finale.Season', 'Two', 'starts', 'right', 'where', 'Season', 'One', 'premiere', 'closure', 'viewers', 'where', 'waiting', 'opened', 'up', 'many', 'more', 'questions', 'be', 'answered', 'season', 'Sydney', 'forced', 'work', 'someone', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'see', 'again', 'take', 'down', 'evil', 'people', 'who', 'lied', 'deal', 'personal', 'life', 'meshing', 'spy', 'life', 'tracking', 'down', 'enemy', 'Sloane', 'forbidden', 'love', 'co-worker', 'Season', 'Two', 'full', 'family', 'drama', 'heartening', 'moments', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'plot', 'twists', 'interesting', 'moments', 'jaw-droping', 'season', 'finale', 'viewer', 'speechless', 'highly', 'anticipating', 'next', 'season.Season', 'Three', 'again', 'right', 'where', 'second', 'season', 'left', 'off', 'season', 'very', 'difficult', 'Sydney', 'forced', 'deal', 'losing', 'multiple', 'friends', 'family', 'memebers', 'Sydney', 'start', 'anew', 'rebuild', 'what', 'once', 'had', 'forced', 'ally', 'evil', 'Sloane', 'must', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'change', 'woman', 'who', 'damper', 'love', 'life', 'forced', 'work', 'be', 'polite', 'Rambaldi', 'mystery', 'very', 'thick', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'revealing', 'many', 'answers', 'common', 'Alias', 'style', 'opening', 'up', 'more', 'questions', 'end', 'season', 'betrayal', 'addition', 'spy', 'family', 'tree', 'Season', 'Three', 'shocking', 'finale', 'ends', 'ripping', 'apart', 'everything', 'Sydney', 'knew', 'leaving', 'unable', 'trust', 'anyone', 'thought', 'four', 'picks', 'up', 'month', 'season', 'three', 'ended', 'Sydney', 'finally', 'up', 'quitting', 'CIA', 'Shortly', 'realize', ""'quitting"", 'was', 'ruse', 'now', 'working', 'undercover', 'organization', 'CIA', 'Sydney', 'deal', 'working', 'people', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'see', 'again', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'betrayed', 'also', 'out', 'someone', 'else', 'may', 'have', 'betrayed', 'not', 'people', 'thought', 'season', 'four', 'Sydney', 'rebuilds', 'trust', 'thought', 'could', 'never', 'speak', 'again', 'as', 'well', 'bond', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'existed', 'Rambaldi', 'unheard', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'second', 'half', 'end', 'season', 'Sydney', 'must', 'be', 'off', 'saving', 'world', 'Finally', 'well', 'Sydney', 'finally', 'world', 'order', 'shock', 'lifetime', 'when', 'one', 'person', 'thought', 'could', 'trust', 'tells', ""n't"", 'been', 'completely', 'honest', 'her.Season', 'Five', 'final', 'season', 'Alias', 'right', 'where', 'fourth', 'season', 'left', 'shocking', 'premiere', 'Sydney', 'forced', 'deal', 'even', 'more', 'hardship', 'when', 'someone', 'close', 'life', 'even', 'harder', 'when', 'out', 'pregnant', 'Now', 'must', 'find', 'who', 'caused', 'lose', 'close', 'friend', 'Sydney', 'criminals', 'anyone', 'who', 'willing', 'help', 'Secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'true', 'intentions', 'resurface', 'best', 'moment', 'season', 'series', 'finale', 'perfect', 'closing', 'perfect', 'show.As', 'other', 'review', 'said', 'hard', 'say', 'much', 'spoiling', 'surprise', 'hope', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'review', 'helped']",Alias - The Complete Collection

1010299,A1E1I0VK9ZI0XW,B000H5V8DG,J. Pastrana,"[13, 19]","ALIAS began with a bang and took the audience on a shock-per-minute ride that barelled along through the first three seasons. Flawless acting (by Ms. Garner, Mr. Garber, Mr. Rifkin, Mr. Vartan and Ms. Olin specifically), outrageous plot twists, breathtaking suspense and action blended seamlessly into an hour of appointment television. But due to the erratic programming schedule of the third season (new episodes would sometimes come in three to four weeks after), the ratings took a dip.This unfortunately heralded a reactionary tinkering by producers, writers and network executives that only served to make a mess that only got worse as season four unfolded. First, in a bid to undo the damage of the previous season they managed to schedule airing to run uninterrupted through the fourth season - only to deafeat the purpose entirely by producing stand alone episodes that really required no continuity. Without the cliffhanger endings, the suspense came to abrupt halt. Whereas in the previous three seasons, even the mere thought of Sydney getting caught rifling through someone's desk was enough to render a minor heart attack since absolutely anything could happen - in Season 4 each episode played like a by the numbers action show where we could all count on everyone hanging around at the end of the show sharing a cup of coffee for another day's job well done. And perhaps even more damaging was moving the show's central focus away from Sydney altogether. Watch season 4 again and look for even the shadow of a story arc that actually moves Sydney's life forward. She became a periphery on her own show with countless episodes devoted to Vaughn's and Nadia's respective journeys. In small doses this move may have worked but not when it meant devoting large blocks of storylines dealing with the characters around Syndey and leaving her little to do other than reacting to them. Another misstep was the lack of any really menacing villains. A cowardly playboy, a small time drug pusher, really? No, seriously, I want to know - really? Where were the rocket launcher toting maniacal glee of Sark and Lauren and Sloane and Irina? Let's not even dignify the eye-rolling absurdity of the vampire episode, the blatant La Femme Nikita ripoff and the zombie plot line of the finale. The only thing that kept the finale from collapsing under the weight of its misguided hubris was the scalpel sharp precision acting of Lena Olin.Which brings us to season 5. (Spoiler alert) At first, Alias seemed to live up to the promise of a return to its suspenseful earlier seasons. Unfortunately, when you decide to kill off a major character like Vaughn, you had better stick to your convictions otherwise you're just blowing smoke up our collective behinds. It was just a bad idea altogether because Vaughn is indispensible to Sydney's life. However, I would like to present 24 Season Five where major characters kept dropping like flies to maximum shocking effect. And no, however much we may have wished, no one came back from the dead. And might I add - continuity that did not second guess the viewers intelligence or ability to keep up. Now that's conviction and confidence in how good a story you're telling. But at last, the story did (briefly) return to Sydney only to get derailed again when stories began to focus on Rachel and the could-you-be-any-more-boring Balthazar Ghetty. With the diminished number of episodes, it was even more galling to have to waste time on Agent Grace's insipid backstory. The best thing he ever did was the sacrifice at the end of the show. And by then all the deaths seemed, well, gutless - it's the last ep right, so who cares who you kill. Don't get me wrong though, there were high points - Irina's complexity (thank heavens no one decided to ""reform"" her) and the return of the always entertaining Mr. Sark (though sadly without partner in crime Lauren Reed).

1010300,A26X2TG93OTXVU,B000H5V8DG,Justin Heath,"[37, 42]","Just out of college, Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is recruited by Arvin Sloan (Ron Rifkin) to be part of a globe-trotting secret government spy agency known as SD-6. When tragic events occur Sydney realizes that SD-6 is not what it seems and joins up with her father (Victor Garber) at the CIA as a double agent to bring Sloan down with the help of her undercover handler and future lover Vaughn (Michael Vartan) and her partner Dixon (Carl Lumbly). Meanwhile, Sloan races to uncover the artifacts of an ancient profit known as Rambaldi, the possessor of all of them will become so powerful that they could become immortal and rule the world.ABC was unusually good to ""Alias"". While they gave the show an opportunity to bring its 5-year story toward a satisfying conclusion, the show went through so many changes in the meantime it is hard to talk about it as one entity. Creator J.J. Abrams starts out keeping things very simple. Season 1 is like a run-and-gun video game where in episode after episode Sydney sneaks into a secret facility in a fantastic disguise, steals or downloads something for the CIA under the cover of SD-6 and then runs, kicks and punches her way out. Part ""La Femme Nikkita"", part ""Mission: Impossible"", it is a light and sound show.In a rare example of positive network and creative collaboration Abrams got a call to reinvent the fledgling series (5th place will make a network start to get religion). What came out of the meeting was a complete dismantling of the series as we knew it and the establishment of something better. The show ditched the head-scratching cliffhanger endings for more self-contained episodes, but Abrams was given the freedom to continue his story arcs and flesh out the character relationships into what will ultimately be a tangled web of familial soap opera drama involving Syd's mother (Lena Olina) and Sloan's daughter.Mid-way though the 2nd season and into the 3rd , ""Alias"" hits its stride. In a series filled with stupendous action sequences, a 2-hour finale that culminates in a rollicking, all-out brawl between Sydney and an evil duplicate of her roommate (just watch) that rips their apartment to splintered shreds ranks as one of the coolest scenes in modern TV for me. It is also here when the look of the show is expanded to a gorgeous cinematic scope it will have to the end. I could just drink up the colors and cinematography of this show. In addition to a perfectly short and sweet intro, Micahel Giacchino's on-target original score is laced with sound-alike Bernard Hermann violin riffs that beautifully puts a classic Hitchcock spy thriller spin on things.Abrams has wrapped his core cast so tight with indispensable characters - including a show-stealing Kevin Weisman as computer ace Marshall (a 4th season bit where Marshall goes in the field, and must pass a retinal scanner, is classic) - that he has little room for twists and suspense. Unlike 2001's ""24"", we know that all of the ""Alias"" characters must stay safe to keep the story moving. He compensates by bringing in one long lost family member after another. Mothers, sisters, aunts and stepfathers all are revealed to be a close part of Sydney's universe. Some will find it a convoluted overkill, others will find it giving everyone more depth and resonance.At the center of it all is Garner, who gamely goes for all the network's guilty pleasure requirements to put her in skimpy bikinis and lingerie. Strikingly beautiful, she has two modes as an actress (fighting and crying), but fills the heels of our kick-butt heroine perfectly - commanding the show and the audience around her just as a great hero should. Garber is an ever-present force of dignity and credibility. The show's fuel is arguably Rifkin who makes such a classically nasty villain and yet give him a vulnerability that, despite his pension for murder, makes you want to believe him.Now, here's the problem with ""Alias"" and Abrams' writing style. Abrams spends a lot of time, for lack of a better word, stalling. Several episodes go by with nothing being revealed and wrenches being thrown into the gears of the story for no other purpose than to artificially drag out the over-arching plot until the end of the season, end of the series or maybe even until Abrams can finally settle on an endgame. Like many of the HBO serials, there is a lot of pointless running in place here.Delivering a kick-butt girl-power action hero, a few David E. Kelley music-over-dialog montages and a focus on fashion and exotic locations mixed with some fierce violence, smashing guy-movie car chases and creativity in the gadgets and story lines that most women won't appreciate, ""Alias"" may have suffered a bit of gender confusion with the viewing public. I'm not sure if Abrams set out to create the ultimate gay man's spy series, but here it is. The big difference between ""Alias"" and the other spy shows is the endless imagination Abrams and his crew infuse it with. Tiny details like the inventive array of gadgets and weapons (like DNA replicating masks and microwave bombs) keep us enthralled.Sure there are quite a few cracks in cinematically polished armor, but ""Alias"" is an overall solid, action-packed, visually vibrant piece of popcorn entertainment. Recommended for those that want something a little different and are willing to indulge its contrivances and trust that it actually might be going somewhere. The modern spy series given a little twist - Abrams gives it a refreshing imagination, Garner gives it strength, Garber credibility, and Rifkin a force to be reckoned with.",5,"A Well-Crafted,

It is sturdy and has a gleaming gold exterior that does not begin to show up in the picture featured here at all.  If you are thinking of a holiday gift, THIS is the one to choose.  Also, it ships very nicely and the DVDs are packaged in a way so that they don't fall out.That said, I will add my comments to the other reviews regarding the show itself.  I had actually never seen the show prior to ordering this set.  But I kept hearing all the hype about it and I have to say that the series is absolutely one of the very best.JJ Abrams of Lost fame created and wrote for the show and I have to say that Lost and Alias are two of my top three television series.  What a genius!I grew up in the 60's watching ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" and of course James Bond, and I loved this series about a young woman who erroneously has been led to believe that she works for a covert division of the CIA.  Moreover, the writers do not have the viewers just blindly accepting that this woman is a ""super spy"" with extraordinary powers.  Instead, they give a very plausible rationale for her extreme gifts in the world of espionage.LOL  I have to admit that if I could be any fictional character from a television series....it would have to be Sydney Bristow.  Jennifer Gardner just made this character come alive.  I would love to have an alter ego = female spy fighting for the ""good guys.""Although I previously liked Jennifer Garnder and thought she was a pretty good actress on the big screen, Alias made me realize what an absolutely amazing and talented actress she is.Likewise, ALL the actors in the series are SO awesome.  Of course, Michael Vartan is great and played his part beautifully but I thought that the performance by Kevin Weisman who played Marshall was incredible.

1010307,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000H5V8DG,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","Alias was a great concept that got a little weird when it started to focus on the Rambaldi storyline.  The first few seasons where that was merely in the background were great.  Jennifer Garner's character believed that she was working for the CIA (which she could not reveal to anyone) finds out after her fiancee was killed by the organization she was really working for what she was really involved in.  From there the show focuses on her life as a double agent and her attempts to bring down the rouge spy agency/criminal organization.Where Alias really shined was character development and casting those parts.  Every character that was around for a significant amount of time changed from the time they were first introduced.  And of course Alias was a world where being dead did not always mean staying dead.  I think the best storyline of the series was the time jump, and the way it was done.  Sydney having lost two years with no memory, then finding out exactly how and why her memory was erased was a great payoff.  Especially when that is the kind of a story that often falls flat at the big reveal.The one drawback to the series as I said before is by the end the entire focus was on the Rambaldi storyline, and making the whole supernatural/eternal life storyline.  It really did change the feel of the show, and while it did provide a good explanation for Sloane's motivation from the beginning, I think it did better when those parts of the storyline were in a few episodes of the season as opposed to the focus of the season.  Overall though if you are looking for a show that combined action, comedy, great acting and a unique take on the spy world (plus the bonus of Jennifer Garner in skimpy outfits on a pretty consistent basis) this is a good one.",4,Overall a very good series,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,1770,"['Alias', 'was', 'great', 'concept', 'got', 'little', 'weird', 'when', 'started', 'focus', 'Rambaldi', 'storyline', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'where', 'was', 'merely', 'background', 'were', 'great', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'character', 'believed', 'was', 'working', 'CIA', 'could', 'not', 'reveal', 'anyone', 'out', 'fiancee', 'was', 'killed', 'organization', 'was', 'really', 'working', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'involved', 'show', 'life', 'double', 'agent', 'attempts', 'bring', 'down', 'rouge', 'spy', 'agency/criminal', 'organization.Where', 'Alias', 'really', 'shined', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'casting', 'parts', 'Every', 'character', 'was', 'significant', 'amount', 'time', 'changed', 'time', 'were', 'first', 'introduced', 'course', 'Alias', 'was', 'world', 'where', 'being', 'dead', 'did', 'not', 'always', 'mean', 'staying', 'dead', 'think', 'best', 'storyline', 'series', 'was', 'time', 'jump', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'Sydney', 'having', 'lost', 'two', 'years', 'memory', 'then', 'finding', 'out', 'exactly', 'how', 'why', 'memory', 'was', 'erased', 'was', 'great', 'payoff', 'Especially', 'when', 'kind', 'story', 'often', 'flat', 'big', 'reveal.The', 'one', 'drawback', 'series', 'said', 'end', 'entire', 'focus', 'was', 'Rambaldi', 'storyline', 'making', 'whole', 'supernatural/eternal', 'life', 'storyline', 'really', 'did', 'change', 'feel', 'show', 'did', 'provide', 'good', 'explanation', 'Sloane', 'motivation', 'beginning', 'think', 'did', 'better', 'when', 'parts', 'storyline', 'were', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'opposed', 'focus', 'season', 'are', 'looking', 'show', 'combined', 'action', 'comedy', 'great', 'acting', 'unique', 'take', 'spy', 'world', 'bonus', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'basis', 'good', 'one']",Alias - The Complete Collection

1010311,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000H5V8DG,Robert Moore,"[2, 2]","Warning!  Spoilers are littered throughout this review!First, am I reviewing the series or the product?  My five-star review is for the series, not the product.  I watched ALIAS on TV when it first came out and having wanted to see various bits over the past two years, I decided I would buy the whole thing on DVD.  I was very tempted by the complete set (with the Rambaldi artifact box), but after getting a good look at it I realized it would not mesh well with other DVD box sets that I owned, so I decided that I would pay a bit more money and get each season individually.  I'm glad that I did.  I was able to get three seasons used off Amazon and bought the other two seasons new.I became interested in rewatching ALIAS for two reasons.  First, I watched earlier this summer FELICITY for the first time.  I thoroughly enjoyed the show and realized that many of the actors on FELICITY would later appear on ALIAS, like the romantically paired (on FELICITY) Greg Gunberg and Amanda Foreman (interestingly, the guy who played the hipster friend of Amanda Foreman's FELICITY character was Kevin Weis, with whom she was romantically linked on ALIAS as Marshall Flinkman's wife).  Besides, I once heard an interview with J. J. Abrams in which he said he came up with the idea of ALIAS by thinking, ""Felicity Porter in the CIA.""  The second major reason I wanted to rewatch the show was the impending (actually, only two days from now) debut of J. J. Abrams fourth major TV series (yes, he's been involved with others, but FELICITY, ALIAS, LOST, and THE FRINGE have gotten the big push others have not) THE FRINGE.  After DOLLHOUSE (Joss Whedon's new series, due out this winter), this is the show I'm most anticipating this year, along with Alan Ball's new series TRUE BLOOD (and if Ron Moore's two series CAPRICA and/or VIRTUALITY make it to production by the end of the 2008-2009 season, those two as well).When I was first watching ALIAS, my impression was that Seasons One and Two were the best, with a very slight dip in quality in Season Three, a sharper drop in Season Four, and further drop in early Season Five before getting very good again at the end.  This largely corresponds with my reviewing.  Season Three was a bit better than I remembered and Season Five even more enjoyable at the end than I recalled.  Season Four still disappoints, however.There are so many great things about this show.  There are also a couple of things you simply have to learn to ignore, things that fall into the ""Willing suspension of disbelief"" category.  For instance, the world is a very, very big place.  But if anyone on the show needs to get to any spot on the globe, it doesn't seem to take more than a few hours.  But short of an SR-71 (or presumably the super secret Aurora spy plane) this simply isn't possible.  Plus, all the airplanes shown as transport o the show are subsonic.  Nonetheless, international logistics never seems to be a problem for Sydney and Company.  Still, the show as a whole is so much fun and so compelling, that as a viewer I have no trouble cutting them slack on this, unlike, say, PRISON BREAK, where you have to cut them slack on a few dozen things every episode (in my opinion, you can't call for a suspension of disbelief on everything that happens on a show).Though we are introduced to a large number of characters over the seasons, the core cast is Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), initially working for what she takes to be a black ops section of the CIA, SD6, but in reality part of an international criminal organization known as the Alliance.  Though allegiances change over the years, on the side of the angels with Sydney are Michael Vaughan (Michael Vartan) of the CIA, her father Jack Bristow (the brilliant Victor Garber), her field partner Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbley), and technical genius Marshall Flinkman.  On the side of the devils are Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) and recurring characters Irina Derevko (played by the beautiful and talented Lena Olin) and Julian Sark (David Anders).  The thread that runs through the show are the artifacts of an unknown Renaissance genius named Milo Rambaldi, someone so brilliant that he makes DaVinci look slow witted.  Arvin Sloane's driving obsession with Rambaldi along with Sydney's prophesied role in the culmination of Rambaldi's work remain unifying elements in each season of the series.  One didn't have to be a Rambaldi to realize that the series, if allowed to end on its own terms (and while it was cancelled earlier than many of us would have liked, they were allowed to wrap up the series as they wished), that it would only end when the mysteries of Rambaldi and Sydney's role in them were resolved.Along the way through the five seasons ALIAS helped establish TV as a medium in which movie stars were free to appear as guest stars.  Few if any shows have had more remarkable guest stars than ALIAS.  Faye Dunaway, Christian Slater, Isabella Rosselini, the aforementioned Lena Olin, Sonia Braga (the last three playing the Derevki sisters), Quentin Tarantino, David Cronenberg, Amy Irving, Joel Grey, Ethan Hawke, Peter Berg, Lindsay Crouse, Roger Moore, Rutger Hauer, and Djimon Hounsou, not to ignore series regular Victor Garber, were some of the actors better known for their work on stage and screen than TV, though the series also had some great TV veterans like Terry O'Quinn (before becoming famous as Locke on LOST) and Ricky Gervais.  The casting from beginning to end was simply impeccable on the show.One of the most important aspects of the show was its role in promoting female heroes on TV.  My own reading of TV over that time is that Buffy had made TV irreparably safe for heroic female characters.  Xena and Dana Scully had anticipated what was about to happen with empowered females on TV, but without Buffy they would perhaps have been remembered as exceptions.  Buffy was the character that changed all the roles.  Xena was too much of a cartoon to make people accept females kicking butt as something not to be taken as exceptional.  But after Buffy it has been a commonplace.  But there had to be actual instances of heroic females as evidence that the rules had changed.  Aeryn Sun on FARSCAPE, Max on DARK ANGEL, and Sydney Bristow were the first -- and along with Veronica Mars and Starbuck from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, still the best.  When someone writes the history of heroic women on TV, there will be a pre-Buffy section mentioning characters like the 1950s Annie Oakley, Emma Peel of THE AVENGERS, Dana Scully, and Xena, then a section on Buffy, and finally the next wave.  Sydney Bristow should and will get her own chapter.  And what a great job Jennifer Garner did!  Though not trained in martial arts, she used her considerable athleticism (and early dance training -- indeed, dance seems to be a wonderful training ground for cinematic martial artists, further proof being the absolutely astonishing fight scenes by Summer Glau in SERENITY, showing that for a prima ballerina it is just choreography) to bring Sydney Bristow to life more believable than any other female hero.  In fact, to this day I've seen no TV female hero (and yes, I'm avoiding the word ""heroine"" intentionally -- ""heroines"" traditionally are anything but heroic) more physically convincing than Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow.  On top of this she brought acting chops that should have earned her a string of Emmys.  At least she got some nominations, unlike Lauren Graham, who astonishingly never got a single nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy when she should have won seven straight times.I strongly recommend anyone interested in quality TV getting acquainted with ALIAS.  Few shows have had higher production values or better casts.  And while the overall story flagged a bit in Season Four and early in Season Five, the show took risks and kept striving to tell well an ambitious story.  It is bound to remain one of the touchstones of great television.",5,One of the better series of the past decade,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,7978,"['Warning', 'Spoilers', 'are', 'littered', 'review',

Serving almost as the Generation X, female version of James Bond, `Alias' is a heartpounding spy-series that does not know how to give the audience a break.Throughout the Series 105 episodes we are given a glimpse into the life of Sydney Bristow and her unbelievable and crazy decade-long transition from a wide-eyed nave graduate student, to the worldly and weathered woman that she became, with all the bumb's and bruises along the way; and let's not forget all the butt-kicking that came along with that as well...With Seasons One and Two, starts off with a pilot that introduces us to the happy and excited Syndey Bristow, her relationship with her estranged father, her two best friends: Francie and Will, and her soon-to-be fianc&eacute;; not to mention her job as an undercover spy for the CIA.  But it isn't long before Sydney realizes that she is not working for the CIA, but in fact for the very enemy she thought she was fighting, which leads her into a dangerous life as a double agent, fighting the war on both fronts.  While leading this life her personal life becomes very stressed, and she learns that sometime its impossible to separate the work from the personal.Season Three picks up approx 2 years after the season two finale, and to stay mostly spoiler-free all I will say is that her life has been turned upside down, and the season focus's on her quest for understanding her life.Season Four picks up about a year after season 3, and finds Sydney starting a new job, going back to being a Secret Agent, but with a few surprises on the work front.Season Five picks up again, about a year after season 4 and finds Sydney facing the realities of the world, and of her life...As you can see not much can be said without giving anything way.  This is an extremely complex/continuity heavy show that is really well known for being hard to follow (missing several minutes of an episode can affect your understanding of not only the next couple of episodes, but story lines several years down-the-lines) and this aspec's initially turned people off from the series in its broadcast run, in favor of the DVDs.Presented here are all 105 episodes, on 29 discs, with all the special features from the individual releases, as well as a special DVD with new bonus features and a commemorative book all packaged inside the Rambaldi artifact (a thing that play's a centeral role throughout the series).",5,The Complete Story,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,2674,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'amazing', 'show', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'missing', ""can't-take-a-breath"", 'pilot', 'mezmorizing', 'series', 'finale', 'Alias', 'was', 'always', 'shock', 'factor', 'once', 'got', 'claws', 'was', 'letting', 'go', 'Serving', 'almost', 'Generation', 'X', 'female', 'version', 'James', 'Bond', 'Alias', 'heartpounding', 'spy-series', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'give', 'audience', 'Series', '105', 'are', 'given', 'glimpse', 'life', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'unbelievable', 'crazy', 'decade-long', 'transition', 'wide-eyed', 'nave', 'graduate', 'student', 'worldly', 'weathered', 'woman', 'became', 'bumb', 'way', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'butt-kicking', 'came', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'pilot', 'happy', 'excited', 'Syndey', 'Bristow', 'relationship', 'estranged', 'father', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Francie', 'Will', 'soon-to-be', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'not', 'mention', 'job', 'undercover', 'spy', 'CIA', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Sydney', 'not', 'working', 'CIA', 'fact', 'very', 'enemy', 'thought', 'was', 'fighting', 'dangerous', 'life', 'double', 'agent', 'fighting', 'war', 'fronts', 'leading', 'life', 'personal', 'life', 'very', 'stressed', 'sometime', 'impossible', 'separate', 'work', 'personal.Season', 'Three', 'up', 'approx', '2', 'years', 'season', 'two', 'finale', 'stay', 'mostly', 'spoiler-free', 'will', 'say', 'life', 'been', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'season', 'focus', 'quest', 'understanding', 'life.Season', 'Four', 'up', 'year', 'season', '3', 'Sydney', 'starting', 'new', 'job', 'going', 'back', 'being', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'few', 'surprises', 'work', 'front.Season', 'Five', 'picks', 'up', 'again', 'year', 'season', '4', 'Sydney', 'facing', 'realities', 'world', 'life', 'can', 'see', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'giving', 'anything', 'way', 'extremely', 'complex/continuity', 'heavy', 'show', 'really', 'well', 'known', 'being', 'hard', 'follow', 'missing', 'several', 'minutes', 'episode', 'can', 'affect', 'understanding', 'not', 'only', 'next', 'couple', 'episodes', 'story', 'lines', 'several', 'years', 'down-the-lines', 'aspec', 'initially', 'turned', 'people', 'series', 'broadcast', 'run', 'favor', 'DVDs.Presented', 'here', 'are', '105', 'episodes', '29', 'discs', 'special', 'features', 'individual', 'releases', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'DVD', 'new', 'bonus', 'features', 'commemorative', 'book', 'packaged', 'Rambaldi', 'artifact', 'thing', 'play', 'centeral', 'role', 'series']",Alias - The Complete Collection

It has an essential designing defect. for example there is not even one simple DVD in this box that you can find defectless. all of them are scratched because of wrong desiging of Disc holders, Some have been caused scratches during the packaging line, some in transportation and some at the first time you pull each of them out!. worse is, there are finger prints on many of discs. Box is very good looking inside out, maybe unique but when you want to pull out a disc and play it and when you see the scratches all over not most, ALL OF THEM, you feel you want to throw it out in trashcan! Yes it comes in shrink wrapp but in Amazon terms, it's status is ""ACCEPTABLE"" not ""NEW"". if they sell it at the price of 30 to 40 dollars it may worth it but in this price buying it just like you roll you money and light is as a cigar!",1,This is only about the packaging of the DVD set,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,879,"['Simply', 'are', 'collector', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'set', 'essential', 'designing', 'defect', 'example', 'not', 'even', 'one', 'simple', 'DVD', 'box', 'can', 'find', 'defectless', 'are', 'scratched', 'wrong', 'desiging', 'Disc', 'holders', 'have', 'been', 'caused', 'scratches', 'packaging', 'line', 'transportation', 'first', 'time', 'pull', 'out', 'worse', 'are', 'finger', 'prints', 'many', 'discs', 'Box', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'maybe', 'unique', 'when', 'want', 'pull', 'out', 'disc', 'play', 'when', 'see', 'scratches', 'not', 'most', 'OF', 'THEM', 'feel', 'want', 'throw', 'out', 'trashcan', 'Yes', 'shrink', 'wrapp', 'Amazon', 'terms', 'status', 'ACCEPTABLE', 'not', 'NEW', 'sell', 'price', '30', '40', 'dollars', 'may', 'worth', 'price', 'buying', 'just', 'roll', 'money', 'light', 'cigar']",Alias - The Complete Collection
