488718,A2HVL790PBWYTU,7885142515,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","If you favor classic wuxia cinema... if you're partial to movies showcasing martial chivalry... if you've got a yen for Michelle Yeoh... then find a way to nab a copy of REIGN OF ASSASSINS. Michelle Yeoh is pushing fifty at this stage in her career, but damn if she's still not holding it down for all the badasss female martial artists in film.The plot unfolds like so: In ancient China, the enlightened Monk Bodhi journeyed from India to China. And such was his spiritual aura and such was his mastery of kung-fu that when he perished, rumors circulated that whosoever possesses and studies his remains will gain the secrets of the martial arts universe. But then the Monk Bodhi's dessicated corpse was split into two halves.800 years later (but still very much in ancient China), the story proper opens with the introduction of the Dark Stone guild, a team of elite assassins that had just procured one half of what's left of Monk Bodhi. Except that it's a fleeting possession. Shockingly, one of their own, the Dark Stone killer known as Drizzle (Kelly Lin), steals away with the half and successfully vanishes, never mind the gnashing of teeth by the Dark Stone leader, the Wheel King... and never mind the copious bounties placed on Drizzle's head.The magic of cinema allows us insight the Dark Stone guild would kill to have. We eyeball Drizzle as she undergoes cosmetic surgery and wakes up with a new face, a new identity. But, wait, before that, she gets schooled by a wise monk who reveals the weaknesses to her signature 41-stroke Water-Shedding Sword technique. Drizzle, you see, earned her name because of this dazzling maneuver, comprising a barrage of slashes executed so expertly and so quickly, it seems as if her victims had been sliced up by drizzling rain. Except that this move of Drizzle's leaves her exposed to several lethal counters.But Drizzle's gone. In her stead is Zeng Jing (Michelle Yeoh), a friendly enough woman but pretty reclusive. And who knows how solitary Zeng Jing's life would've continued on had the local courier Jiang Ah-Sheng (South Korean actor Jung Woo Sung) not become smitten with her. Fortunately, Ah-Sheng's humorous wooing of Zeng Jing is kept to a minimum, and so the film avoids falling into that pitfall of obnoxious broad comedy. Zeng Jing, guarded as she is, sees something in the unassuming Ah-Sheng and she opens her heart. This would later bite her in the butt.Sometimes being bloody relentless pays off. When Zeng Jing makes a mistake, word reaches the Dark Stone guild. ""She can change her face, but she can't change her aura,"" one villain remarks, one of several assassins to converge on Zeng Jing's hideaway village.Even though John Woo is involved in this project, it's merely at a supervisory capacity. Those anticipating slow motion doves or poetic bullet ballets will be pretty vexed. REIGN OF ASSASSINS is predominantly primary director Chao-bin Su's baby. Guy's got his fingerprints all over this one. He ensures that there's attention paid to plot and character development. The story, elegantly plotted, draws you in, and that's also in large part due to Michelle Yeoh's performance. Michelle Yeoh, graceful and fluid, still delivers those phenomenal martial arts thrills, but she doesn't let you forget that she can also act the hell out of a scene. No, she doesn't get too many of those fiercely emotional moments. She normally plays these reserved roles. But her presence is commanding.Chao-bin Su doesn't neglect the bad guys. He trots out an assortment of colorful adversaries for our reformed assassin. Each of the Dark Stone villains is furnished with a backstory, and so when each killer meets his or her maker, you do feel a bit of an emotional tug. The Dark Stone chief, the enigmatic Wheel King (Wang Xueqi), in particular, reveals an unconventional motivation. Ultimately, REIGN OF ASSASSINS rises above most of the other contemporary wuxia films by dint of an involving narrative, expert acting, a certain groundedness, and dynamically staged fight sequences. I can't speak enough of the awesomeness of Michelle Yeoh.The DVD's bonus stuff:- The Making Of the film featurette (00:22:28 minutes, with no English sub-titles)- Theatrical Trailer (with optional English sub-titles)",5,"""I only see an average housewife repairing shoes.""",1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,4261,"['favor', 'classic', 'wuxia', 'cinema', ""'re"", 'partial', 'movies', 'showcasing', 'martial', 'chivalry', ""'ve"", 'got', 'yen', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'then', 'find', 'way', 'nab', 'copy', 'REIGN', 'OF', 'ASSASSINS', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'pushing', 'fifty', 'stage', 'career', 'damn', 'still', 'not', 'holding', 'down', 'badasss', 'female', 'martial', 'artists', 'film.The', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'so', 'ancient', 'China', 'enlightened', 'Monk', 'Bodhi', 'journeyed', 'India', 'China', 'such', 'was', 'spiritual', 'aura', 'such', 'was', 'mastery', 'kung-fu', 'when', 'perished', 'rumors', 'circulated', 'whosoever', 'possesses', 'studies', 'remains', 'will', 'gain', 'secrets', 'martial', 'arts', 'universe', 'then', 'Monk', 'Bodhi', 'dessicated', 'corpse', 'was', 'split', 'two', 'halves.800', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'ancient', 'China', 'story', 'proper', 'introduction', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'guild', 'team', 'elite', 'assassins', 'had', 'just', 'procured', 'one', 'half', 'what', 'left', 'Monk', 'Bodhi', 'fleeting', 'possession', 'Shockingly', 'one', 'own', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'killer', 'known', 'Drizzle', 'Kelly', 'Lin', 'away', 'half', 'successfully', 'vanishes', 'never', 'mind', 'gnashing', 'teeth', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'leader', 'Wheel', 'King', 'never', 'mind', 'copious', 'bounties', 'placed', 'Drizzle', 'head.The', 'magic', 'cinema', 'insight', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'guild', 'would', 'kill', 'have', 'eyeball', 'Drizzle', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'up', 'new', 'face', 'new', 'identity', 'wait', 'schooled', 'wise', 'monk', 'who', 'weaknesses', 'signature', '41-stroke', 'Water-Shedding', 'Sword', 'technique', 'Drizzle', 'see', 'earned', 'name', 'dazzling', 'maneuver', 'comprising', 'barrage', 'slashes', 'executed', 'so', 'expertly', 'so', 'quickly', 'victims', 'had', 'been', 'sliced', 'up', 'drizzling', 'rain', 'move', 'Drizzle', 'exposed', 'several', 'lethal', 'counters.But', 'Drizzle', 'gone', 'stead', 'Zeng', 'Jing', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'friendly', 'enough', 'woman', 'pretty', 'reclusive', 'who', 'how', 'solitary', 'Zeng', 'Jing', 'life', 'would', ""'ve"", 'continued', 'had', 'local', 'courier', 'Jiang', 'Ah-Sheng', 'South', 'Korean', 'actor', 'Jung', 'Woo', 'Sung', 'not', 'become', 'smitten', 'Fortunately', 'Ah-Sheng', 'humorous', 'wooing', 'Zeng', 'Jing', 'kept', 'minimum', 'so', 'film', 'avoids', 'falling', 'pitfall', 'obnoxious', 'broad', 'comedy', 'Zeng', 'Jing', 'guarded', 'sees', 'something', 'unassuming', 'Ah-Sheng', 'heart', 'would', 'later', 'bite', 'butt.Sometimes', 'being', 'bloody', 'relentless', 'off', 'When', 'Zeng', 'Jing', 'mistake', 'word', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'guild', 'can', 'change', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'aura', 'one', 'villain', 'remarks', 'one', 'several', 'assassins', 'converge', 'Zeng', 'Jing', 'hideaway', 'village.Even', 'John', 'Woo', 'involved', 'project', 'merely', 'supervisory', 'capacity', 'anticipating', 'slow', 'motion', 'doves', 'poetic', 'bullet', 'ballets', 'will', 'be', 'pretty', 'vexed', 'REIGN', 'OF', 'ASSASSINS', 'predominantly', 'primary', 'director', 'Chao-bin', 'Su', 'baby', 'Guy', 'got', 'fingerprints', 'one', 'attention', 'paid', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'elegantly', 'plotted', 'also', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'performance', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'graceful', 'fluid', 'still', 'phenomenal', 'martial', 'arts', 'thrills', ""n't"", 'let', 'forget', 'can', 'also', 'act', 'hell', 'scene', 'No', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'many', 'fiercely', 'emotional', 'moments', 'normally', 'reserved', 'roles', 'presence', 'commanding.Chao-bin', 'Su', ""n't"", 'neglect', 'bad', 'guys', 'trots', 'out', 'assortment', 'colorful', 'adversaries', 'reformed', 'assassin', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'furnished', 'backstory', 'so', 'when', 'killer', 'maker', 'do', 'feel', 'bit', 'emotional', 'tug', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'chief', 'enigmatic', 'Wheel', 'King', 'Wang', 'Xueqi', 'particular', 'unconventional', 'motivation', 'Ultimately', 'REIGN', 'OF', 'ASSASSINS', 'most', 'other', 'contemporary', 'wuxia', 'films', 'dint', 'involving', 'narrative', 'expert', 'acting', 'certain', 'groundedness', 'dynamically', 'staged', 'fight', 'sequences', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'enough', 'awesomeness', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Making', 'film', 'featurette', '00:22:28', 'minutes', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'optional', 'English', 'sub-titles']","Reign Of Assassins [2010, HK] DVD"

488720,AXOO7BPM22BDO,7885142515,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[10, 12]","The remains of a legendary Buddhist monk are reputed to have mystical powers, including healing any type of injury.  The body has been split in half with the Dark Stone Assassins, led by the Wheel King (Wang Xuqei), possessing one portion and have located the other belonging to Prime Minister Zhang.  The Wheel King's top assassins, The Magician (Leon Dai), Lei Bin (Shawn Yue) and Drizzle (Kelly Lin) murder the entire family, including the eldest son Renfeng.  Drizzle, named for her martial arts style that 'bleeds opponents like rain', steals the remains and hides in the company of a monk named Wisdom.  Wisdom explains there are flaws in Drizzle's technique that a master can exploit, and sacrifices himself to try to teach her enlightenment.  A disillusioned Drizzle is challenged by Renfeng, who survived the slaughter, but is again defeated.  Drizzle undergoes plastic surgery from a renowned doctor and emerges as Zeng Jing (a slightly digitized Michelle Yeoh) and relocates to a new town where she meets Ah-Sheng (Jung Woo-Sung), a courier, whom she eventually marries.To replace Drizzle, the Wheel King recruits Turquoise (Barbie Hsu), a sociopath and nymphomaniac who killed her husband and his family on her wedding night because he couldn't perform.  Turquoise is teamed with the Magician and Lei Bin as they hunt for their former associate.  A chance encounter leads the Dark Stone Assassins to Zeng/Drizzle and she tries to negotiate her freedom for the remains.  But the lure of power proves there's no honor among thieves as long-standing grudges resurface and the assassins battle both her and each other.  The Wheel King makes off with the prize while Lei Bin and Turquoise follow the wounded Zeng to her home only to be met by Ah-Sheng, who has a few surprises of his own up his sleeve.  Mindful of Wisdom's final lessons to her, Zeng is determined to find redemption, regardless of what it may cost her.This latest in the wuxia-style kung fu films lets its pedigree shine through.  John Woo lends his name to the proceedings and there's touches of his influence present.  Anything with Michelle Yeoh is a treat, and Jung Woo-Sung comes through in his role, especially when he's trying to woo his lady.  Barbie Hsu's Turquoise is much like Go-Go Mubari from 'Kill Bill'.  Even Wang Xuqei as the Wheel King was clearly having a good time.The cinematography is a little grainy but the action is as fast and furious as you'd expect.  Even after a lifelong diet of this stuff, it never gets old.  My only complaint was the way the swords curved and bent during the fights; though it was deliberate, it just looked cheesy.The biggest problem lies in the script.  Written by Su Chao-Pin, duality is a recurring theme in the story- with each character possessing secrets and often living two lives.  Stories are always important, but when this one tries to be clever it comes off as convoluted.  There are many different layers built into it and though they flesh out the story they still feel like filler.  The plot twists are like taking an off-ramp instead of sign posts to distract you for a minute while still pointing in the right direction.  Events spring up out of nowhere and I had to rewind a couple times to make sure I had it all straight.  It has a 'Usual Suspects'-style approach to it but never quite gets there, coming off as bloated.  There's just too much stuff crammed into it.Ultimately Reign of Assassins is a movie that sometimes takes itself too seriously but is still fun to watch.  But it's a good way to spend an afternoon and that's what kung-fu movies are all about.",4,Overstuffed but Fun,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,3610,"['remains', 'legendary', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'are', 'reputed', 'have', 'mystical', 'powers', 'including', 'healing', 'type', 'injury', 'body', 'been', 'split', 'half', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'Assassins', 'led', 'Wheel', 'King', 'Wang', 'Xuqei', 'possessing', 'one', 'portion', 'have', 'located', 'other', 'belonging', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Zhang', 'Wheel', 'King', 'top', 'assassins', 'Magician', 'Leon', 'Dai', 'Lei', 'Bin', 'Shawn', 'Yue', 'Drizzle', 'Kelly', 'Lin', 'murder', 'entire', 'family', 'including', 'eldest', 'son', 'Renfeng', 'Drizzle', 'named', 'martial', 'arts', 'style', 'opponents', 'rain', 'remains', 'hides', 'company', 'monk', 'named', 'Wisdom', 'Wisdom', 'are', 'flaws', 'Drizzle', 'technique', 'master', 'can', 'exploit', 'try', 'teach', 'enlightenment', 'disillusioned', 'Drizzle', 'challenged', 'Renfeng', 'who', 'survived', 'slaughter', 'again', 'defeated', 'Drizzle', 'undergoes', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'renowned', 'doctor', 'Zeng', 'Jing', 'slightly', 'digitized', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'new', 'town', 'where', 'Ah-Sheng', 'Jung', 'Woo-Sung', 'courier', 'whom', 'eventually', 'marries.To', 'replace', 'Drizzle', 'Wheel', 'King', 'recruits', 'Turquoise', 'Barbie', 'Hsu', 'sociopath', 'nymphomaniac', 'who', 'killed', 'husband', 'family', 'wedding', 'night', 'could', ""n't"", 'perform', 'Turquoise', 'teamed', 'Magician', 'Lei', 'Bin', 'hunt', 'former', 'associate', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'Assassins', 'Zeng/Drizzle', 'negotiate', 'freedom', 'remains', 'lure', 'power', 'proves', 'honor', 'thieves', 'long-standing', 'grudges', 'resurface', 'assassins', 'battle', 'other', 'Wheel', 'King', 'prize', 'Lei', 'Bin', 'Turquoise', 'follow', 'wounded', 'Zeng', 'home', 'only', 'be', 'met', 'Ah-Sheng', 'who', 'few', 'surprises', 'own', 'up', 'sleeve', 'Mindful', 'Wisdom', 'final', 'lessons', 'Zeng', 'determined', 'find', 'redemption', 'regardless', 'what', 'may', 'cost', 'her.This', 'latest', 'wuxia-style', 'kung', 'fu', 'films', 'pedigree', 'shine', 'John', 'Woo', 'name', 'proceedings', 'touches', 'influence', 'present', 'Anything', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'treat', 'Jung', 'Woo-Sung', 'through', 'role', 'especially', 'when', 'trying', 'woo', 'lady', 'Barbie', 'Hsu', 'Turquoise', 'much', 'Go-Go', 'Mubari', ""'Kill"", 'Bill', 'Even', 'Wang', 'Xuqei', 'Wheel', 'King', 'was', 'clearly', 'having', 'good', 'time.The', 'cinematography', 'little', 'grainy', 'action', 'fast', 'furious', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Even', 'lifelong', 'diet', 'stuff', 'never', 'old', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'way', 'swords', 'curved', 'bent', 'fights', 'was', 'deliberate', 'just', 'looked', 'cheesy.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'script', 'Written', 'Su', 'Chao-Pin', 'duality', 'recurring', 'theme', 'story-', 'character', 'possessing', 'secrets', 'often', 'living', 'two', 'lives', 'Stories', 'are', 'always', 'important', 'when', 'one', 'be', 'clever', 'off', 'convoluted', 'are', 'many', 'different', 'layers', 'built', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'still', 'feel', 'filler', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'taking', 'off-ramp', 'instead', 'sign', 'posts', 'distract', 'minute', 'still', 'pointing', 'right', 'direction', 'Events', 'spring', 'up', 'nowhere', 'had', 'rewind', 'couple', 'times', 'make', 'sure', 'had', 'straight', ""'Usual"", ""Suspects'-style"", 'approach', 'never', 'quite', 'there', 'coming', 'off', 'bloated', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'stuff', 'crammed', 'it.Ultimately', 'Reign', 'Assassins', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'too', 'seriously', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'afternoon', 'what', 'kung-fu', 'movies', 'are']","Reign Of Assassins [2010, HK] DVD"

I'm so glad I did! This movie was totally awesome! Plus, I loved the story.Yeoh plays a former assassin who has changed her identity (and her face) to hide her old life. Later, she meets a quiet, unassuming man (played by Jung Woo Sung...who is gorgeous!) and gets married. Unfortunately, Yeoh can't hide from her past and a chance trip to the bank starts to unravel her new life, as she discovers everyone is not who they may seem.Of course, there are more twist and turns, but what really set this movie a part for me was the wonderful chemistry between Yeoh and Sung. I enjoyed watching their romance unfold. Plus, there were some truly comical moments as the two of them settle into married life. This is where the comparions to ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" come into play. Still, ""Reign of Assassins"" stands on its own as a great movie with some stunning action.Speaking of the action, it's purely wire-fu and swords, which is alright with me. Though, if you're looking for a film with a lot of hand to hand combat then this is not for you. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic movie which I thoroughly enjoyed.I am sad to see this has not been released in North America on Blu-Ray. I prefer Blu-ray quality, but not the blu ray import price. Hopefully the Weinstein Company, who owns the North American rights, will release this on blu ray soon.

I got it because Michelle Yeoh stars and I get all her movies but the whole cast is into it and does a very good job.  It starts a bit slow with some clunky subtitles that disappear too fast but only in the beginning.  The story is a bit weak as it's hard to believe these more or less wuxia-talented/skilled people could be so dumb as to believe the superstition around which the tales rotates but it's a simple premise that, amusingly, keeps things easy to follow.  John Woo is listed as a co-director and it has his touch of simple, sentimental plot where you pretty much know what's coming yet still enjoy the way he pulls it off.  Michelle Yeoh, no one's actress of the decade, does her usual competent and better job when she's not doing her usual more than competent and ever engaging martial arts.  Lots of wires here, lots, but stylishly done.

488729,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,7885142515,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Reign of Assassins"" (original Chinese title ""Jianyu"") belongs to a traditional movie genre generally called ""wuxia"" - one of the most famous examples being Academy Award winner ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" - in which warriors in period costumes fight each other with swords or other unique weapons in a superhuman way, and its storyline, which is often very melodramatic, is accompanied by acrobatic stunts.Set in China of the Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644), the film's story centers on the battles over the mummified remains of a Buddhist monk Bodhidharma, which, it is believed, possesses magical powers. Drizzle (Kelly Lin), a strongest assassin of the powerful syndicate The Dark Stone, disappears with half of the mummy after fighting a wise monk Wisdom, who dies wishing her peace in this world.Guilt-ridden Drizzle undergoes a surgery and becomes Zeng Jing (Michelle Yeoh). She starts a new life with a good-natured messenger Jiang Ah-sheng (Jung Woo-sung) without telling him her secrets. But the Dark Stone leader Wheel King (Wang Xueqi), who was also the sword fight teacher for Drizzle / Zeng Jing, is looking for the missing assassin, and the hidden remains of the holy monk, too.Yes, the heroine changes her face with plastic surgery, but this is nothing surprising. ""Reign of Assassins"" is directed by Taiwanese director Su Chao-pin (known for his unique horror ""Silk"") and co-directed by John Woo (remember ""Face/Off""?). I don't know what to ""co-direct"" really means, but the filmmakers offer a new and refreshing take on the wuxia genre, of which plotlines tend to be conventional. The film also adds something new to the familiar genre by creating interesting characters. Wheel King's new assassin, sexy and sadistic Turquoise Leaf (Barbie Hsu) is just one of them.But the film's highlight is definitely the beautifully choreographed fight scenes. They are swift, stylish, elegant (costume design by Emi Wada) and powerful. More than ten years have passed since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and Michelle Yeoh hasn't lost her touch, demonstrating her skills with grace. ""Reign of Assassins"" is an absorbing and entertaining action film, even for those who haven't seen a wuxia film.",5,(4.5 STARS) Top Notch Wuxia Film,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,2205,"['Reign', 'Assassins', 'original', 'Chinese', 'title', 'Jianyu', 'traditional', 'movie', 'genre', 'generally', 'called', 'wuxia', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'examples', 'being', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'warriors', 'period', 'costumes', 'fight', 'other', 'swords', 'other', 'unique', 'weapons', 'superhuman', 'way', 'storyline', 'often', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'accompanied', 'acrobatic', 'stunts.Set', 'China', 'Ming', 'Dynasty', '1368', '1644', 'film', 'story', 'centers', 'battles', 'mummified', 'remains', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'Bodhidharma', 'believed', 'magical', 'powers', 'Drizzle', 'Kelly', 'Lin', 'strongest', 'assassin', 'powerful', 'syndicate', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'half', 'mummy', 'fighting', 'wise', 'monk', 'Wisdom', 'who', 'wishing', 'peace', 'world.Guilt-ridden', 'Drizzle', 'surgery', 'Zeng', 'Jing', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'new', 'life', 'good-natured', 'messenger', 'Jiang', 'Ah-sheng', 'Jung', 'Woo-sung', 'telling', 'secrets', 'Dark', 'Stone', 'leader', 'Wheel', 'King', 'Wang', 'Xueqi', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'sword', 'fight', 'teacher', 'Drizzle', '/', 'Zeng', 'Jing', 'looking', 'missing', 'assassin', 'hidden', 'remains', 'holy', 'monk', 'too.Yes', 'heroine', 'face', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'Reign', 'Assassins', 'directed', 'Taiwanese', 'director', 'Su', 'Chao-pin', 'known', 'unique', 'horror', 'Silk', 'co-directed', 'John', 'Woo', 'remember', 'Face/Off', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'co-direct', 'really', 'filmmakers', 'offer', 'new', 'refreshing', 'take', 'wuxia', 'genre', 'plotlines', 'tend', 'be', 'conventional', 'film', 'also', 'something', 'new', 'familiar', 'genre', 'creating', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Wheel', 'King', 'new', 'assassin', 'sexy', 'sadistic', 'Turquoise', 'Leaf', 'Barbie', 'Hsu', 'just', 'one', 'them.But', 'film', 'highlight', 'definitely', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'swift', 'stylish', 'elegant', 'costume', 'design', 'Emi', 'Wada', 'powerful', 'More', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', ""n't"", 'lost', 'touch', 'demonstrating', 'skills', 'grace', 'Reign', 'Assassins', 'absorbing', 'entertaining', 'action', 'film', 'even', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'wuxia', 'film']","Reign Of Assassins [2010, HK] DVD"
