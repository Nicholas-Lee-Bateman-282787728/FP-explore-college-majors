I like Thumbelina a lot, but I do have a few peeves with it.Pros:1. It's very different. A change from all the princess movies. Don't get me wrong! I LOVE the princess movies, but a change is always nice.2. It inspired me to help the enviroment more.3. The Twillerbees are very cool- I love their home!4. It's a good story, but there isn't any scary stuff. It's hard to have a good movie without a little bit of fright, or on-the-edge-of-your-seat stuff.Cons:1. The animation is NOWHERE NEAR as beautiful as the older ones! It remids me of movies like Toy Story. I DID NOT like the construction Boss Myron. He looks completely unrealistic and despicable.2. I didn't like the way the parents were portrayed as ""kiss-ups."" It's a way of undermining parents authority. Although you must understand, it's not that they are dumb slobs, but they are too busy and don't have time for their daughter. So they simply let her have whatever she wants. It's the classic ""rich kid"" case- a daughter longing for attention and getting it from her firends because it's unavailable from her parents.3. Barbie tells the story to a redhead, brown- eyed Emma, along with a group of kids. I missed the one-on-one, heart-to-heart sister relationship between Barbie and her sisters.4. ""Ashlyn"", Violet's friend, is SOOOO irritating!!! All she says is ""Ch-ya!"" grr....5. I didn't like the way Thumbelina and her friends appeared to the kids at the end. I like the more mystery, where Barbie might say something like, ""Maybe..."" but you never see the fairy-tale people- so the kids are just left thinking.Overall, I really like this movie. I have 4 pros and 5 cons, so I give it a 4 out of 5. I disagree with those who say that the rich girls are terrible. Violet is a brat the whole time, but McKenna makes a small sacrifice to help Thumbelina and learns that true friends aren't people to just impress and try to be better than. SHE LEARNS HER LESSON.I think it's a good movie for kids, but I really miss the old animation. I miss Barbie's old face (have you noticed the change???) and I miss the old style. Other than that, it's good. Enjoy!",4,Thumbelina- very interesting.....,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,2220,"['First', 'all', '13-', 'year-', 'old', 'who', 'Barbie', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'love', 'like', 'Thumbelina', 'lot', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'peeves', 'it.Pros:1', 'very', 'different', 'change', 'princess', 'movies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'LOVE', 'princess', 'movies', 'change', 'always', 'nice.2', 'inspired', 'help', 'enviroment', 'more.3', 'Twillerbees', 'are', 'very', 'cool-', 'love', 'home', '4', 'good', 'story', ""n't"", 'scary', 'stuff', 'hard', 'have', 'good', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'fright', 'on-the-edge-of-your-seat', 'stuff.Cons:1', 'animation', 'NOWHERE', 'NEAR', 'as', 'beautiful', 'older', 'ones', 'movies', 'Toy', 'Story', 'DID', 'NOT', 'construction', 'Boss', 'Myron', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'despicable.2', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'parents', 'were', 'portrayed', 'kiss-ups', 'way', 'undermining', 'parents', 'authority', 'must', 'understand', 'not', 'are', 'dumb', 'slobs', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'daughter', 'simply', 'let', 'have', 'classic', 'rich', 'kid', 'case-', 'daughter', 'longing', 'attention', 'getting', 'firends', 'unavailable', 'parents.3', 'Barbie', 'story', 'redhead', 'brown-', 'eyed', 'Emma', 'group', 'kids', 'missed', 'one-on-one', 'heart-to-heart', 'sister', 'relationship', 'Barbie', 'sisters.4', 'Ashlyn', 'Violet', 'friend', 'SOOOO', 'irritating', 'Ch-ya', 'grr', '.5', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'Thumbelina', 'friends', 'appeared', 'kids', 'end', 'like', 'more', 'mystery', 'where', 'Barbie', 'might', 'say', 'something', 'Maybe', 'never', 'see', 'fairy-tale', 'people-', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'thinking.Overall', 'really', 'movie', 'have', '4', 'pros', '5', 'cons', 'give', '4', '5', 'disagree', 'who', 'say', 'rich', 'girls', 'are', 'terrible', 'Violet', 'brat', 'whole', 'time', 'McKenna', 'small', 'sacrifice', 'help', 'Thumbelina', 'true', 'friends', 'are', ""n't"", 'people', 'just', 'impress', 'try', 'be', 'better', 'SHE', 'LEARNS', 'HER', 'LESSON.I', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'really', 'miss', 'old', 'animation', 'miss', 'Barbie', 'old', 'face', 'have', 'noticed', 'change', 'miss', 'old', 'style', 'Other', 'good', 'Enjoy']",Barbie Presents Thumbelina

When I saw the review, I thought, ""What???""  When my younger sister got this movie and we watched it, I was only disappointed further.  While entertaining, this movie was just NOT GOOD!  It's the story of a fairy named Thumbelina, who gets captured by a snobby rich girl named Makenna whose parents don't have time for her.  They become friends, and find out that the land the baby fairies are going to be born on is being developed by the big bad (not wolf) construction workers...and Makenna's dad.  Thumbelina and Makenna join forces to save the fairies, and eventually succeed.  But even though this story is about saving fairies, not minnows or whales, its themes are very liberal.  It enrages me that politics is creeping into children's programs!  The whole theme is GO GREEN! and  IT'S OK TO BE A SNOB, BECAUSE YOU CAN STILL HAVE FRIENDS!  These aren't values you want taught to your children!  Barbie needs to go back to the princess movies about love and imagination and leave liberalism alone!  Kids are going to start believing that an ordinary life is harebrained parents that care more about their Blackberries than their children!I didn't even mention that the animation of this movie is terrible and the dialogue is extremely cheesy.

1221671,ADLN37B0153N,B001O3M370,Silmarwen,"[1, 1]","I always gave the Barbie movies wide berth before, but I watched Barbie in a Christmas Carol last December and thought it was a lot better than I anticipated so I decided to try another film in the series. I picked Thumbelina because there is no Disney version to compare it to and I have always enjoyed that story. What I did not realize (as I didn't really read the description of the movie on Netflix) is that this version has nothing to do with the fairy tale of Thumbelina. There is a little Twillerbee (why they couldn't just call them fairies and leave them at that, I will never know!) named Thumbelina in the story, but that is all this version really has in common with the traditional Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. Instead of being the story of an abnormally small girl who finds her way to live with the fairies, this version is about a couple of spoiled brats who are given everything by their parents -- including a flower patch with some Twillerbees hiding inside the flowers. It was kind of hard to enjoy the film with such horrible little girls playing the lead human roles, even if Thumbelina does teach one of them to be much better behaved by the end of the story.I did notice that both movies have one thing in common: Barbie plays narrator while telling the children a story. This gets a little bit old as you just get into the story and then you have to pop out to Barbie responding to comments from the children she is with. While the movie was a little plasticky -- I know, I know horrible description, but really, oh so true -- in that the characters aren't really animated to look like real people, the colors were bright & eye catching and the animals were pretty cute. In fact, the pet dog owned by Makena was one of my favorite characters. He is one of those little yippy dogs who thinks that he rules the world and gets outsmarted by the Twillerbees quite often, which was awesome to see. The construction workers were a hoot, too! The plants are very fake looking, though, especially the trees and bushes.Young children, particularly girls will enjoy this short Barbie feature. I didn't think it was too bad, but there is not a lot of storyline involved so it didn't really hold my attention. Tinker Bell was so much cuter that, if you are going to buy one, I would highly recommend getting that one instead as it is much more entertaining for the whole family -- my nephews really like Tinker Bell -- but wouldn't be caught dead watching anything that says Barbie in the title!",3,"Warning: This is NOT the Classic Fairy Tale, But a New Story",1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,2516,"['always', 'gave', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'wide', 'berth', 'watched', 'Barbie', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'last', 'December', 'thought', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'anticipated', 'so', 'decided', 'try', 'film', 'series', 'picked', 'Thumbelina', 'Disney', 'version', 'compare', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'What', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'read', 'description', 'movie', 'Netflix', 'version', 'nothing', 'do', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Thumbelina', 'little', 'Twillerbee', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'call', 'fairies', 'leave', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'named', 'Thumbelina', 'story', 'version', 'really', 'common', 'traditional', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Instead', 'being', 'story', 'abnormally', 'small', 'girl', 'who', 'way', 'live', 'fairies', 'version', 'couple', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'everything', 'parents', 'including', 'flower', 'patch', 'Twillerbees', 'hiding', 'flowers', 'was', 'kind', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'film', 'such', 'horrible', 'little', 'girls', 'playing', 'lead', 'human', 'roles', 'even', 'Thumbelina', 'teach', 'one', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'behaved', 'end', 'story.I', 'did', 'notice', 'movies', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'Barbie', 'narrator', 'telling', 'children', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'old', 'just', 'get', 'story', 'then', 'have', 'pop', 'out', 'Barbie', 'responding', 'comments', 'children', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'plasticky', 'know', 'know', 'horrible', 'description', 'really', 'oh', 'so', 'true', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'animated', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'colors', 'were', 'bright', 'eye', 'catching', 'animals', 'were', 'pretty', 'cute', 'fact', 'pet', 'dog', 'owned', 'Makena', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'one', 'little', 'yippy', 'dogs', 'who', 'rules', 'world', 'outsmarted', 'Twillerbees', 'quite', 'often', 'was', 'awesome', 'see', 'construction', 'workers', 'were', 'hoot', 'too', 'plants', 'are', 'very', 'fake', 'looking', 'though', 'especially', 'trees', 'bushes.Young', 'children', 'particularly', 'girls', 'will', 'enjoy', 'short', 'Barbie', 'feature', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'lot', 'storyline', 'involved', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'attention', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'cuter', 'are', 'going', 'buy', 'one', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'one', 'instead', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'family', 'nephews', 'really', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'watching', 'anything', 'Barbie', 'title']",Barbie Presents Thumbelina

It was a clever marketing ploy to use ""Thumbelina"" as the main title. I thought we'd get a story similar to the fairy tale but this is a far cry from the original tale. The only thing that remains is the name - Thumbelina here happens to be the main character but she belongs to a tiny race of people called the Twillerbees who live amongst the wildflowers in a big field. When Thumbelina and her friends are accidentally transported to the apartment of a spoilt rich girl Makena, they are momentarily trapped. During this period, they learn of a construction project by Makena's parents that will result in the destruction of their habitat. With some persuasion [more like a bribe - Thumbelina promises Makena that she will make stuff for Makena to impress her friend Violet], Makena tries to help the Twillerbees.Frankly, the storyline is not captivating - the Twillerbees are an interesting idea but don't really hold much interest. They seem to possess some magic but once again, the exploration of this magic is not in-depth. The dialogue comes across as stilted and the human girls, Makena and Violet are the epitome of rich, spoilt brats. They are constantly on their cell phones talking about makeovers, and shopping and other trivial things [yes, I know tweens are into these things, but we hear enough of those in real life to have it reiterated on a kid's DVD]. The message of conservation is a good one, but this movie failed to make a positive impression, either on me or my preschooler.",2,Not the original Thumbelina story,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,1636,"['rented', 'DVD', '4-year-old', 'preschooler', 'today', 'watching', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'production', 'was', 'clever', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'use', 'Thumbelina', 'main', 'title', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'story', 'similar', 'fairy', 'tale', 'far', 'cry', 'original', 'tale', 'only', 'thing', 'name', 'Thumbelina', 'here', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'tiny', 'race', 'people', 'called', 'Twillerbees', 'who', 'live', 'wildflowers', 'big', 'field', 'When', 'Thumbelina', 'friends', 'are', 'accidentally', 'transported', 'apartment', 'spoilt', 'rich', 'girl', 'Makena', 'are', 'momentarily', 'trapped', 'period', 'learn', 'construction', 'project', 'Makena', 'parents', 'will', 'result', 'destruction', 'habitat', 'persuasion', '[', 'more', 'bribe', 'Thumbelina', 'Makena', 'will', 'make', 'stuff', 'Makena', 'impress', 'friend', 'Violet', ']', 'Makena', 'help', 'Twillerbees.Frankly', 'storyline', 'not', 'captivating', 'Twillerbees', 'are', 'interesting', 'idea', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'much', 'interest', 'seem', 'possess', 'magic', 'once', 'again', 'exploration', 'magic', 'not', 'in-depth', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'human', 'girls', 'Makena', 'Violet', 'are', 'epitome', 'rich', 'spoilt', 'brats', 'are', 'constantly', 'cell', 'phones', 'talking', 'makeovers', 'shopping', 'other', 'trivial', 'things', '[', 'yes', 'know', 'tweens', 'are', 'things', 'hear', 'enough', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'reiterated', 'kid', 'DVD', ']', 'message', 'conservation', 'good', 'one', 'movie', 'failed', 'make', 'positive', 'impression', 'either', 'preschooler']",Barbie Presents Thumbelina
