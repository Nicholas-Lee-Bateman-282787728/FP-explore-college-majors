The preview looked cute and I loved the ""Oh, a man who doesn't believe in marriage. How refreshing!"" line. I love comedies which subvert the common stereotypes in movies and I had hoped this would be one.I am slowly becoming convinced, however, that somewhere, in Hollywood, is a book. In this book, every movie rule and movie-making law is written down, and everyone involved in the production of a movie - the writers, actors, directors, producers, and donut-fetchers - follow this rule book slavishly. This rule book mandates, apparently, that all romantic comedies MUST have sexual tension between the two main characters and that the ONLY way to achieve this tension is to have the male character be a complete jerk or the female character be completely insane.For this movie, they went with both, and - frankly - I'm tired of it. Hollywood, if anyone is listening, here are the things I don't want to see in a movie. I don't find it sexy when a man pretends to be a doctor, thereby keeping an unconscious woman from receiving legitimate medical attention, just so he can try to bum a ride into her apartment by sharing her cab home. I'm not attracted to men who browbeat and argue disingenuously with women who have mild concussions. And I don't root for two people to ""hook up"" when both of them seem to be complete lunatics.I would like, for the record, a romantic comedy starring two realistic people, not insulting cardboard stereotypes.This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing, but there was nothing worth hearing, in my opinion.

Yes, I am.  I have seen this movie 27 times in the idea that it is so formulistic and so predictable and literally pulls its plot from just about every other `better' romantic comedy out there that you'll swear you've seen this movie many times before.This film is very `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' light; with a good measure of `Hitch', `My Best Friends Wedding', `You've Got Mail' and pretty much any and every Roberts/Ryan/McConaughey movie thrown in for kicks and giggles.You know, the typical girl loves guy who doesn't notice despite its obviousness.  He falls for someone else (in this instance it's her sister) and she has to act happy for them while on the inside she's crying.  Then she meets some arrogant jerk who turns out to be this guy she falls in love with only to have him break her heart about five minutes before she realizes he's the man of her dreams and the movie ends on a happy note.  I don't feel that saying any of that can really constitute as a spoiler since this is pretty much told to us in the preview.Okay, so the story revolves around Jane who is so obsessed with weddings and planning them for her friends that she has never really settled down to plan her own; which is mostly due to the fact that her idiot boss George hasn't figured out that she is madly in love with him.  He falls for her selfish sister Tess instead and Jane winds up planning her wedding.  Then Jane meets Kevin who appears to be a cynical jerk until she realizes that he is respocible for all the beautiful wedding stories she loves to read and collect and that he hides the romantic within himself behind his prickly exterior as a safeguard (duh) so she falls for him and he for her; but love is never that simple.There are funny scenes here, don't get me wrong; but there are not nearly enough to compensate for its familiarity.Katherine Heigl is sweet and charming to a degree but she is no Kate Hudson, and she is easily overshadowed by the remainder of the cast.  Judy Greer needs some better roles because she is constantly proving to be the best thing in a mediocre film.  James Marsden is charming beyond belief and is easily going to make a huge name for himself now that he has shed the Cyclops glasses and hopped into mainstream territory (his one-two-three punch of `Enchanted', `Hairspray' and '27 Dresses' should do nothing but help his career).  Malin Akerman is hilarious as Tess, if not a tad predictably self centered; and while Edward Burns is certainly a nice piece of man-candy (I feel so weird using that term but it seems to fit) he is wooden and boring here.In the end I'd pass on '27 Dresses' because those other 27 movies are far better and more inspired than this one.",2,I've seen this movie 27 times...,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,2959,"['Well', 'judging', 'title', 'review', 'may', 'conclude', 'love', 'movie', 'something', 'then', ""'ll"", 'glance', 'two-star', 'rating', 'realize', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'forcing', 'conclude', 'must', 'be', 'mocking', 'films', 'title', 'Yes', 'am', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', '27', 'times', 'idea', 'so', 'formulistic', 'so', 'predictable', 'literally', 'plot', 'just', 'other', 'better', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'there', ""'ll"", 'swear', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'before.This', 'film', 'very', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'light', 'good', 'measure', 'Hitch', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Wedding', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'pretty', 'much', 'Roberts/Ryan/McConaughey', 'movie', 'thrown', 'kicks', 'giggles.You', 'know', 'typical', 'girl', 'loves', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'notice', 'obviousness', 'someone', 'else', 'instance', 'sister', 'act', 'happy', 'inside', 'crying', 'Then', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'guy', 'love', 'only', 'have', 'break', 'heart', 'five', 'minutes', 'man', 'dreams', 'movie', 'happy', 'note', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'saying', 'can', 'really', 'constitute', 'spoiler', 'pretty', 'much', 'told', 'preview.Okay', 'story', 'Jane', 'who', 'so', 'obsessed', 'weddings', 'planning', 'friends', 'never', 'really', 'settled', 'down', 'plan', 'own', 'mostly', 'due', 'fact', 'idiot', 'boss', 'George', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'madly', 'love', 'selfish', 'sister', 'Tess', 'instead', 'Jane', 'up', 'planning', 'wedding', 'Then', 'Jane', 'meets', 'Kevin', 'who', 'be', 'cynical', 'jerk', 'respocible', 'beautiful', 'wedding', 'stories', 'read', 'collect', 'romantic', 'prickly', 'exterior', 'safeguard', 'duh', 'love', 'never', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'compensate', 'familiarity.Katherine', 'Heigl', 'sweet', 'charming', 'degree', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'easily', 'overshadowed', 'remainder', 'cast', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'better', 'roles', 'constantly', 'proving', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'mediocre', 'film', 'James', 'Marsden', 'charming', 'belief', 'easily', 'going', 'make', 'huge', 'name', 'now', 'shed', 'Cyclops', 'glasses', 'hopped', 'mainstream', 'territory', 'one-two-three', 'punch', 'Enchanted', 'Hairspray', 'Dresses', 'should', 'do', 'nothing', 'help', 'career', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'hilarious', 'Tess', 'not', 'tad', 'predictably', 'self', 'centered', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'certainly', 'nice', 'piece', 'man-candy', 'feel', 'so', 'weird', 'using', 'term', 'fit', 'wooden', 'boring', 'here.In', 'end', ""'d"", 'pass', ""'27"", 'Dresses', 'other', '27', 'movies', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'inspired', 'one']",N/A

Being very helpful at a wedding, she realized that she was fascinated with being an integral part of weddings. We meet her as she is functioning as a bridesmaid at two different weddings on the same night. That night she also stumbles upon a writer. However, what she does not know is that this writer who seems very cynical is actually the one that writes articles that she collects about weddings.You can see how everything is being set up for a formula movie. The producers tried to give the characters more depth than most of these formula movies where there is always a love triangle of some sort. And of course, the writer has to put his foot into it somewhere right at the most inopportune time we know this is coming. However, the thing that makes the movie fascinating is how they get from point A to point Z, and all the people and points in between.So enjoy the movie and enjoyed the quirkiness of seeing 27 dresses but do not expect anything extraordinary.I saw the Blu-Ray version; by now, of course Blu-Ray is blas&eacute;.

1149549,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0015I2RSO,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 24]","There have been a lot of contrived romantic comedies before, but ""27 Dresses"" really takes the cake (and yes, I purposely used a wedding-related phrase). This movie relies on comedy that's nothing like real comedy, conflict that's nothing like real conflict, and characters so annoying and clich&eacute; that they don't even fit the traditional definition of caricature. If you've read any of my reviews, then you know I've been kind to many such films; I gave ""No Reservations,"" ""Music and Lyrics,"" and ""P.S. I Love You"" favorable reviews, not because they represented reality, but because they were entertaining stories founded on the fantasy of happily ever after. ""27 Dresses"" is not fantastic, and because of that, I could focus on nothing other than how unrealistic it was. At one point, Katherine Heigl says, ""I feel like I just found out my favorite love song was written about a sandwich."" Dumb, I know, but it does accurately express how I feel about this film.The story opens in 1986 with a wedding and a voiceover narration. A young girl in attendance finds her true calling after escorting her baby sister to the bathroom: she was meant to not only be a bridesmaid, but also a wedding planner, an organizer, and a general overseer of everything. She comes to this conclusion when her bride-to-be cousin rushes into the dressing room in a panic because the back of her dress tore open. The young girl ingeniously uses her sister's hair ribbon to sew the hole shut, after which she ties it into a pretty little bow. We then flash forward to the present day and learn that the voiceover narration belonged to Jane (Heigl), who's introduced at a New York City bridal boutique, fitting a wedding dress that her friend will be wearing (thank God both women are the same size). Since that fateful day in 1986, she seems to have grown comfortable planning all her friends' weddings, but she has yet to plan one of her own. And thus we discover the driving force of the plot.As soon as this is established, the audience is made to endure a ridiculous scene in which Jane attends two weddings on the same night--she has a cab drive her back and forth numerous times, and she changes dresses during each trip (she offers the driver five hundred dollars for the whole night if he promises to not look at his rear view mirror; by the end of the night, she gives him a mere hundred and sixty, as each glance was an automatic twenty-dollar deduction). At one of the weddings, she meets Kevin (James Marsden), who immediately comes off as a charming, witty, and cynical wedding-hater. Little does Jane know that Kevin writes wedding articles under the alias Malcolm, articles that she absolutely adores.Meanwhile, Jane's sister, Tess (Malin Akerman) has returned to New York after six months in Europe. Young, perky, and platinum blonde, Tess is ready to look for a new man. And she finds one: Jane's boss, George (Edward Burns). If it weren't for the fact that Jane is secretly in love with George, this wouldn't be a problem--in no time at all, Tess lies her way into a marriage proposal, meaning that Jane has yet another wedding to plan. But how can she knowing her sister is as phony as a three-dollar bill? I'll tell you why: Jane is just as phony. She hides her feelings behind a faade of smiles and laughter, and she's completely incapable of saying no to anyone. What's worse is that Kevin has been personally hired by Tess to cover the wedding, and Jane finally learns that his beautifully written articles don't express how he truly feels. He believes that weddings are a sham, from the hordes of useless gifts to the expensive planning. He writes the articles only to work his way up in the world of journalism, and lo and behold, he sees a story opportunity with Jane, the constant bridesmaid with a closet full of ugly dresses. So we basically have a film filled with phonies, which I guess is fitting, considering the nature of the plot.But that isn't good enough, since it's blatantly required that the two fall in love, then break up, then fall in love again. There's no question that their relationship is predictable--the relationships in romantic comedies are always predictable. The problems stem not from their romance, but from their fake personalities, which to me were like fingernails on a chalkboard. I didn't believe these characters for one second, and this is in spite of the meaningless side characters that function as comedy relief. One such example is Casey (Judy Greer), Jane's best friend. Why they're friends, I have no idea; Casey is obnoxious, intrusive, and just generally grating. It's sad that she's probably the most honest character in the entire film, especially since her wisecracks aren't even close to funny.It basically boils down to Jane's growing resentment against Tess, Kevin's excuses to enter Jane's life, and a convenient set of circumstances that convince Jane to lead her own life for once. This dime-a-dozen story is not what makes ""27 Dresses"" so bad; it's the way this dime-a-dozen story is told. Here's a film that tries so hard to be touching and comedic that it ends up failing at both. It's painful to see Katherine Heigl and James Marsden--both capable actors--stuck in something so preposterous, so contrived, and so forced. What do I mean by ""forced""? When Jane first sees Tess and George together at a club, she runs out the back door, screams a curse, and begins banging a wall with her handbag. She then turns around and realizes she's in a room where a fiftieth anniversary party is being held. If there's one thing I hate, it's when comedy like this is shoved into our faces.",2,Confessions of a Bridesmaid,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,5645,"['have', 'been', 'lot', 'contrived', 'romantic',

Meanwhile, Jane's sister, Tess, returns from Europe, becomes engaged to George, Jane's boss and the man of Jane's dreams, and asks Jane to handle the wedding.  Not one to turn it down, Jane steps up to the challenge...but can she hide her feelings for George forever?  And what about the persistently sarcastic Kevin?Is it formulaic?  Oh, most definitely.  Are there parts that are head banging?  Yes, I found one in particular really bad. (See below for spoiler)  But it is such a sweet, endearing movie, how can you hate it (particularly if you are a woman and sentimental)?Katherine Heigl shone as Jane.  She was completely believable as the oft-walked over older sister.  Malin Akerman as Tess was absolutely perfect!  She really excelled at becoming ""Bridezilla"", so much I laughed and laughed.  James Marsden was funny as the sarcastic reporter, burned by love, and I loved how Edward Burns made George into the oblivious object of two women's desires.The story was also pretty unique and overall cute.  I loved the scene where Jane puts on all 27 dresses, posing for Kevin's camera.  The costuming department went out, making each one unique and clever.  The story was also funny, somber, happy, sad, biting, angry, unfair, cruel...you really feel for Jane as she gets walked over and want to yell at her, ""Wake up and fight back!""So, I highly recommend to the ladies out there, ready to laugh and believe in weddings and love.  It'll never win an Oscar or an Academy Award...but when it is this cute, this funny, this adorable, do you really care?SPOILER: Jane and George finally kiss but decide there was no pizzazz so they must not be meant for each other.  Lame way to allow Jane to move on to the real Romeo.Brought to you by:*C.S.

If you hate them, you'll like the potshots it takes.

The director told wardrobe to find the ugliest dresses and succeeded.

A lot of research was done on weddings in order to capture the distinct look of each one.""The Running of the Brides"" is an annual tradition that sees women from all over the country camping out at a store where they all try to get the perfect dress to get married in. It's a shopping frenzy as people race around to get a dress or trade with others.Also included are three deleted scenes. The first one sees Jane trying to get a cab in New York (good luck) and was wisely cut. The best of the bunch sees Jane, her best friend (Judy Greer) and Tess' best friend trying on bridesmaid dresses. The interaction between the three of them is amusing.

1149555,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B0015I2RSO,Danielle Turchiano,"[0, 2]","Hot off the knock-out box office success of Knocked Up, Katherine Heigl must have been hoping she had caught the momentary ""it girl"" status even more than her 27 Dresses character Jane hopes for catching the bouquet at one of the many, many weddings which she not only attends but usually has a hand in planning.  Director Anne Fletcher probably had the same thought in the back of her mind, but she didn't let her film rest solely on Heigl's shoulders; she rounded out 27 Dresses with a sizeable (in name, as well as talent) cast sure to make the film worthy of being viewed more times than the average wedding video.Most of 27 Dresses has been done before: there is a perennial case of adoration from afar (or in this case, one office over), as well as a main character (Heigl's Jane) who is stagnant in her love life as she merely pines for the stereotypical unobtainable man (her boss, George, played by Edward Burns); a younger woman enters the picture (Jane's baby sister Tess, played by Malin Ackerman), only to steal the crush's focus and the dream wedding; an upbeat montage as the heroine begins to see just how silly she has been; and of course a wisecracking sidekick (the always scene-stealing Judy Greer).  Where 27 Dresses dares to step outside the comfort zone of a very simple rom-com formula, though, is where it comes alive:  enter a charmingly cynical new male acquaintance, Kevin (James Marsden), into the equation, and Jane is forced to see things beyond the bubble of her old-fashioned traditions.  What could have been stale and sophomoric, offering only half-hearted chuckles, quickly turns into a slightly sardonic (and somewhat unconventional) story about falling in love in today's post-modern world.Fletcher does a great job of setting up who the leading men and women are versus who the supporting players are in 27 Dresses, so it is never a question about with whom Jane is supposed to end up--not to the audience at least.  In that way, we are always a step or two ahead of Jane, leaving us free to focus on the subtleties and intricacies of the performances to understand why things will turn out the way they do.  Marsden's eyes sparkle, for example, while Burns' are narrow and dark.  In scenes opposite Heigl, Marsden is animated and energetic to Burns' stiff ""upper management"" display (despite well-placed props to showcase he should be as down-to-earth as the earthy company he runs).  With Kevin, Jane is able to be her true, uncensored self (perhaps because she does not hold him on the pedestal she does George), but with George, she comes off as serious and reserved, a little girl on her best behavior to impress.One might not expect a message in a light, fluffy romantic comedy, but with 27 Dresses, Fletcher is adamant to teach young girls today that in order for a relationship to really work, both parties must always be themselves.  The idea is emphasized time and again, mirrored in all three permutations of couples (Kevin and Tess are never presented as an option), yet it is never brought up in a vocally expositional way to make the audience feel like they are beaten over the head with the notion.  27 Dresses is an all-around sweet and pure, almost virginal without being vanilla, commentary on what relationships--filmic or otherwise--should be today.The DVD release of 27 Dresses offers three deleted scenes, a few making-of featurettes, and a short documentary.  ""Wedding Party"" a simple, self-explanatory (though lengthy, especially these days!) behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film that focuses on interviews with its stars--ie, those that make up the wedding party within the film.  ""Jane's World"" is a quick but detailed look at the set design.  ""The Running of the Brides"" is the documentary, which looks at an annual bridal gown sale and the brides-to-be who come from all across the country to obtain a once-of-a-lifetime deal.  However, the third featurette, ""You'll Never Wear That Again,"" is the most fun because it focuses on the costume design and what went into picking the twenty-seven most ridiculous dresses that ended up in Jane's closet.The one thing missing from this DVD is a commentary track because after viewing ""Wedding Party,"" it is abundantly clear just how much heart and soul went into the film and how much fun everyone had doing it, and it would have been nice to hear what memories would spill out of Fletcher's mouth as she screened and revisited the somewhat fairytale-inspired world she created.",4,A Spunky and Sardonic Chick Flick for the Modern Woman,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,4500,"['Hot', 'off', 'knock-out', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Katherine', 'Heigl',

Yes, what we have here is the eternal rectangle...Kevin decides to do an expose on the commercialism of marraige in his paper, the New York Journal and interviews Jane and Tess. At one dramatic point, Jane and Kevin almost die in a car accident in heavy rain when their car hydroplanes and gets stuck in the mud. They end up in a country & western bar where they get roaring drunk and perform Elton John's ""Bennie and the Jets"" song, dancing hilariously on the bar counter to loud applause. They end up making mad, passionate love in her Volvo while it is raining cats and dogs outside. The next morning, Kevin's cynical story appears with pictures of Jane in many of her Bridesmaid's dresses. Jane and Tess are furious as Tess is described as a Bridezilla by Kevin, among other things. In a moment of fury, Jane reveals all Tess's lies to George in a brutal powerpoint display at a pre nuptial family dinner. Tess is very upset and George walks out and subsequently calls off the marraige. Kevin tries to get back together with Jane with no luck. back in the office, George kisses Jane after realising that she should be the one for him. However, they soon realise they have no love for each other at all. Jane finally becomes aware that Kevin is the man she loves and bravely tells him so at a wedding on a boat that he is covering. Love conquers all and one year later, they are married by the beach; it looks like the Hamptons, and all her 27 friends are now her bridesmaids, while her blonde sister, Tess is the Maid of Honour. How ironic, Ha! Ha!There are some great lines in this movie, like when Jane waits up for her baby sister who has gone on a date with George, and Tess walks in at 4am to find her cleaning the stove top. Jane says nonchalantly, ""Just doing a bit of cleaning, harnessing my Chi."" Very funny! Tess has amusing one liners too, like, "" For some reason, girls just don't like me, I don't know why?""At one point in reply to Kevin's probing questions, Jane remarks, "" I don't have needs, I'm Jesus."" One of the best parts that I enjoyed, is when Jane's repressed feelings explode like an erupting volcano and she tells Tess cruelly, "" Today, you are just some bitch who broke my heart and cut up my mother's wedding dress!"" Strong stuff!James Marsden, who played Prince Charming in ""Enchanted"", acts very well and I expect more starring roles for him in the future. The attention to detail impressed me. I saw that the little girl playing Jane as a child had what Dental Surgeons call a Class II Division 2 malocclusion and, lo and behold so does Katherine Hiegler. Hiegler is a polished actress and she carries off this role with aplomb. The enchanting happy ending brought tears to my eyes, and it will to your eyes too. All you romantics out there, see this movie with your loved one. You won't regret it.

In an hilarious sequence, she taxies back and forth between ceremonies, changing dresses in the cab.  When Jane is knocked over in the rush for a bridal bouquet, she is rescued by Kevin (James Marsden), a scruffy, cynical writer who escorts her home and who challenges her romantic view of marriage.

1149567,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0015I2RSO,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","As Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan and Sandra Bullock have moved somewhat hesitantly past ing&eacute;nue roles, the baton is being poised for passing to someone worthy of the frothy tradition of the Hollywood rom-com. Beyond an unscientific combination of charisma and beauty, it takes a certain onscreen malleability to be able to conquer this most indefatigable of movie genres. There have been several candidates - Reese Witherspoon faring the best, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Aniston, even Hilary Swank - but I would argue that none take to it as dexterously as Katherine Heigl. She has an immediately accessible quality that sprang fully loaded with her surprisingly assured turn as the accidentally pregnant entertainment reporter in last year'sKnocked Up. This time, the actress puts her charms to considerable use in this featherweight 2008 comedy that hinges quite literally on the saying ""Always a bridesmaid, never a bride"". Directed in formulaic fashion by Anne Fletcher from a predictable screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna (who did a much snappier job onThe Devil Wears Prada), the film has such a packaged sense of its comic possibilities that nothing related to the storyline feels fresh.Heigl stars as Jane Nichols, a classic ""giver"" in the truest definition of the word as she has been a willing bridesmaid 27 times over. In typical rom-com fashion, we start with a flashback of an eight-year-old Jane helping her cousin with a last-minute rip in her bridal gown. This is the beginning of her obsession with weddings and how she appears to spend every weekend helping out her friends on their big day. She dreams of her own big day with her handsome boss George, the owner of an ecologically responsible outdoor-goods company. In fact, she becomes so efficient as his girl Friday that he doesn't think of her romantically and instead falls hard for Tess, Jane's selfish, hard-living baby sister. What's worse is that Jane finds herself organizing Tess' wedding to the man of her dreams. Things get even more complicated when a cynical young journalist Kevin Doyle, becomes fascinated with Jane's constant bridesmaid status and decides to write a story about her. It doesn't take much to figure out the rest.Even though her beauty is toned down a mere fraction, Heigl scores as Jane despite the spiraling contrivances of her character's situation. The toothy James Marsden (Hairspray,Enchanted) makes a spirited foil as Kevin for the comically romantic shenanigans. They make a good pair, but most of their chemistry doesn't appear until late in the film. As Tess, Cameron Diaz doppelganger Malin Ackerman appears to be playing a slightly more savvy variation on the similarly unsympathetic character she played inThe Heartbreak Kid. Edward Burns (The Holiday) seems more smug than usual as the clueless George, and perennial second-stringer Judy Greer (Elizabethtown,The TV Set) plays Jane's best friend Case with scabrous, fire-engine-level alacrity. It's surprising that a better soundtrack couldn't be compiled for the film beyond the tired use of Elton John's ""Bennie and the Jets"" during a drunken night at a roadside bar.The 2008 DVD offers a few standard extras though no commentary track. The making-of featurette, ""The Wedding Party"", runs fifteen minutes and feels more like a promotional piece. Costume designer Catherine Marie Thomas is featured on the seven-minute ""You'll Never Wear that Again"", which discusses the creation of the 27 dresses of the title, and the five-minute ""Jane's World"" features production designer Shepherd Frankel talking about the look of the film and the design of the various weddings seen in the film. Not related to the movie, the quick ""The Running of the Brides"" is a small piece that spotlights the one-day wedding dress sale at Filene's Basement, a bargain-priced, east-of-the-Mississippi store chain. Rounding out the extras are three deleted scenes lasting four minutes in total.",3,"Frothy, Formulaic Drivel Saved from Complete Obscurity by a Genuinely Winning Heigl",1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,3932,"['Julia', 'Roberts', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'have', 'moved', 'somewhat', 'hesitantly', 'ing', 'eacute', 'roles', 'baton', 'being', 'poised', 'passing', 'someone', 'worthy', 'frothy', 'tradition', 'Hollywood', 'rom-com', 'unscientific', 'combination', 'charisma', 'beauty', 'certain', 'onscreen', 'malleability', 'be', 'able', 'conquer', 'most', 'indefatigable', 'movie', 'genres', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'candidates', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'faring', 'best', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'even', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'would', 'argue', 'none', 'take', 'as', 'dexterously', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'immediately', 'accessible', 'quality', 'sprang', 'fully', 'loaded', 'surprisingly', 'assured', 'turn', 'accidentally', 'pregnant', 'entertainment', 'reporter', 'last', ""year'sKnocked"", 'Up', 'time', 'actress', 'charms', 'considerable', 'use', 'featherweight', '2008', 'comedy', 'quite', 'literally', 'saying', 'bridesmaid', 'never', 'bride', 'Directed', 'formulaic', 'fashion', 'Anne', 'Fletcher', 'predictable', 'screenplay', 'Aline', 'Brosh', 'McKenna', 'who', 'did', 'much', 'snappier', 'job', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'film', 'packaged', 'sense', 'comic', 'possibilities', 'nothing', 'related', 'storyline', 'feels', 'fresh.Heigl', 'stars', 'Jane', 'Nichols', 'classic', 'giver', 'truest', 'definition', 'word', 'been', 'willing', 'bridesmaid', '27', 'times', 'over', 'typical', 'rom-com', 'fashion', 'start', 'flashback', 'eight-year-old', 'Jane', 'helping', 'cousin', 'last-minute', 'rip', 'bridal', 'gown', 'beginning', 'obsession', 'weddings', 'how', 'spend', 'weekend', 'helping', 'out', 'friends', 'big', 'day', 'own', 'big', 'day', 'handsome', 'boss', 'George', 'owner', 'ecologically', 'responsible', 'outdoor-goods', 'company', 'fact', 'so', 'efficient', 'girl', 'Friday', ""n't"", 'think', 'romantically', 'instead', 'hard', 'Tess', 'Jane', 'selfish', 'hard-living', 'baby', 'sister', 'What', 'worse', 'Jane', 'organizing', 'Tess', 'wedding', 'man', 'dreams', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'cynical', 'young', 'journalist', 'Kevin', 'Doyle', 'fascinated', 'Jane', 'constant', 'bridesmaid', 'status', 'decides', 'write', 'story', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'figure', 'out', 'rest.Even', 'beauty', 'toned', 'down', 'mere', 'fraction', 'Heigl', 'Jane', 'spiraling', 'contrivances', 'character', 'situation', 'toothy', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Hairspray', 'Enchanted', 'spirited', 'foil', 'Kevin', 'comically', 'romantic', 'shenanigans', 'make', 'good', 'pair', 'most', 'chemistry', ""n't"", 'appear', 'late', 'film', 'Tess', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'doppelganger', 'Malin', 'Ackerman', 'be', 'playing', 'slightly', 'more', 'savvy', 'variation', 'similarly', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'played', 'inThe', 'Heartbreak', 'Kid', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'Holiday', 'more', 'smug', 'usual', 'clueless', 'George', 'perennial', 'second-stringer', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Elizabethtown', 'TV', 'Set', 'Jane', 'best', 'friend', 'Case', 'scabrous', 'fire-engine-level', 'alacrity', 'surprising', 'better', 'soundtrack', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'compiled', 'film', 'tired', 'use', 'Elton', 'John', 'Bennie', 'Jets', 'drunken', 'night', 'roadside', 'bar.The', '2008', 'DVD', 'few', 'standard', 'extras', 'commentary', 'track', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Wedding', 'Party', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'feels', 'more', 'promotional', 'piece', 'Costume', 'designer', 'Catherine', 'Marie', 'Thomas', 'featured', 'seven-minute', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Wear', 'Again', 'creation', '27', 'dresses', 'title', 'five-minute', 'Jane', 'World', 'production', 'designer', 'Shepherd', 'Frankel', 'talking', 'look', 'film', 'design', 'various', 'weddings', 'seen', 'film', 'Not', 'related', 'movie', 'quick', 'Running', 'Brides', 'small', 'piece', 'one-day', 'wedding', 'dress', 'sale', 'Filene', 'Basement', 'bargain-priced', 'east-of-the-Mississippi', 'store', 'chain', 'Rounding', 'out', 'extras', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'lasting', 'four', 'minutes', 'total']",N/A

She dreams of having a beautiful romantic wedding herself, much like her parents.  Then her younger sister, Tess, ends up with, yes you guessed it, Jane's boss, crushing her dreams.  But then along comes a  reporter who stumbles upon Jane and finds her situation, being in so many weddings, fascinating and decides to write an article about her.  As predicted, he falls for her and maybe he's the one that could change her ""always-a-bridesmaid"" destiny.My buddies here at Amazon must have changed me.  I use to watch romantic comedies and thoroughly enjoy them.  I've been watching more thrillers/horror than anything else these days. But either I've changed or this just didn't do it for me.

Although I'm much closer to the bride's mother demographic, than a traditional age bride, I found this movie fun and pleasant to watch, albeit predictable.  Even the ""surprise"" plot twists and misunderstandings were predictable for any adult who has been watching movies more than a year or two.  Still the plot twists were more satisfying than if the movie progressed the way the director thought the audience thought it would.Katherine Heigl was totally believable as the too nice, overly indulgent bridesmaid and perfect doormat assistant to her boss at work.  (Although certain plot aspects, such as her running back and forth across town all night to be in two weddings at the same time are not.) You just know that someone this nice is going to crack, particularly when her boss whom she's had a crush on for years is about to marry her spoiled, self-absorbed sister.  IMO, this is the part of the movie most worth watching.

1149581,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0015I2RSO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","27 DRESSES is formulaic and predictable, and I have no problem with that, given that I really enjoyed this movie and, in many moments of watching it, grinned the big grin of having fun. Katherine Heigl makes the whole thing work, and, combined with her terrific stint inKnocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition), I no longer think it's a fluke that she's this good a comedienne. She's tall and beautiful, yet her most appealing quality is that she doesn't at all mind looking goofy. And, in those horrible, horrible bridesmaid outfits, Katherine Heigl looks dang goofy.Jane Nichols (Heigl) was eight when she found her purpose in life - which is being the sensei of averting wedding day disasters. Jane grows up self-effacing and accomodating and very, very responsible. And years later she's still in love with weddings, still can't say no to attending one, can't say no to organizing one. And all those awfully garish bridesmaid dresses she's worn? She keeps them in her closet.For a long while now Jane has quietly pined for her boss George (Edward Burns), a perfectly perfect outdoorsy entrepreneur type who is also a vegetarian and a Big Brother to a Latino kid. And because you have to put the heroine thru her paces, Jane's gorgeous, spoiled younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman) blows into town and instantly bags Jane's boss. So hell hath no mean disposition like a woman having to organize the nuptials of her much mooned-over boss and her younger sister.As if that's not enough torture, Jane keeps running into Kevin, a cynical newspaper writer who just annoys the living hoolies out of her. Kevin's disdain of all things weddingy immediately antagonizes Jane (to him, weddings are all about ""the forced merriment, the horrible music, or the bad food""). But what Jane doesn't know is that Kevin's beat is the matrimonial column and that he's angling to write a piece on her and her serial bridesmaid lifestyle. Thing is, as played by James Marsden, Kevin isn't as slimy and calculating as you'd suppose. Not the least, dude also sings a mean rendition of ""Benny and the Jets,"" even if the words are made-up gobbledy-gook. The ol' Cyclops really surprised me with how well he dives into his romantic leading man role, and with how funny he is. The ""Benny and the Jets"" bar scene is the best moment in this film.27 DRESSES has just a bit of that FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL vibe going on, only from a woman's perspective. It's a pretty funny film, even managing to plant a few gentle digs at the wedding industry. And, to come full circle with the title, I dig what Jane does with those 27 dresses, there at the end. Katherine Heigl has a talent for this type of role. She's good enough of an actress - and she endears herself to the audience with that yearning, self-sacrificing thing she does - that you can't help but feel for her (and maybe even squirm with her) as she sadly sees her sister's fling with her boss evolve into something more serious. I think I need to see Katherine Heigl in more romantic comedies.Malin Akerman (WATCHMEN's Silk Spectre II) is good in her thankless role of the younger self-absorbed sister Tess and Judy Greer again knocks it out the park with her snarky best friend take (she also rocked that role in13 Going on 30 (Fun & Flirty Edition), which starred Jennifer Garner, another girl not afraid of looking silly. Edward Burns, though, plays such a nice guy here that he ends up a pretty dull and boring dude.Special Features: three deleted scenes, featuring Jane hailing a cab only to have someone jump into it ahead of her, Jane trying on her bridesmaid dress for Tess's wedding, and Tess accidentally almost sending Gatsby (George's huge pet) to doggy heaven; ""The Wedding Party"" - the Making Of featurette; ""You'll Never Wear That Again"" - the costume design featurette; ""Jane's World"" - the set design featurette; and ""The Running of the Brides"" focuses on New Jersey's Filene's Basement bargain store and its hectic annually-held one day wedding gown sale.27 DRESSES is a chick flick, and it's familiar and you see where it's going - but I'm saying that Katherine Heigl is so likeable that you end up forgiving the been there/done that storyline. All the girls I know (all three of 'em) love this movie. If you're a dude, you'll score high points if you pop this in the player on date night. Although, if it's date night, you should probably take her out for lobster or something, instead of staying at home watching movies...",4,"""The maid of honor is a peculiar young woman...""",1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,4473,"['27', 'DRESSES', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'have', 'problem', 'given', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'many', 'moments', 'watching', 'grinned', 'big', 'grin', 'having', 'fun', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'whole', 'thing', 'work', 'combined', 'terrific', 'stint', 'inKnocked', 'Up', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'no', 'longer', 'think', 'fluke', 'good', 'comedienne', 'tall', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'most', 'appealing', 'quality', ""n't"", 'mind', 'looking', 'goofy', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'bridesmaid', 'outfits', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'dang', 'goofy.Jane', 'Nichols', 'Heigl', 'was', 'eight', 'when', 'found', 'purpose', 'life', 'being', 'sensei', 'averting', 'wedding', 'day', 'disasters', 'Jane', 'up', 'self-effacing', 'accomodating', 'very', 'very', 'responsible', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'love', 'weddings', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'attending', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'organizing', 'one', 'awfully', 'garish', 'bridesmaid', 'worn', 'closet.For', 'long', 'while', 'now', 'Jane', 'quietly', 'pined', 'boss', 'George', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'perfectly', 'perfect', 'outdoorsy', 'entrepreneur', 'type', 'who', 'also', 'vegetarian', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Latino', 'kid', 'have', 'put', 'heroine', 'paces', 'Jane', 'gorgeous', 'spoiled', 'younger', 'sister', 'Tess', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'town', 'instantly', 'Jane', 'boss', 'So', 'hell', 'hath', 'mean', 'disposition', 'woman', 'having', 'organize', 'nuptials', 'much', 'mooned-over', 'boss', 'younger', 'sister.As', 'not', 'enough', 'torture', 'Jane', 'running', 'Kevin', 'cynical', 'newspaper', 'writer', 'who', 'just', 'living', 'Kevin', 'disdain', 'things', 'weddingy', 'immediately', 'antagonizes', 'Jane', 'weddings', 'are', 'forced', 'merriment', 'horrible', 'music', 'bad', 'food', 'what', 'Jane', ""n't"", 'know', 'Kevin', 'beat', 'matrimonial', 'column', 'angling', 'write', 'piece', 'serial', 'bridesmaid', 'lifestyle', 'Thing', 'played', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Kevin', ""n't"", 'slimy', 'calculating', ""'d"", 'suppose', 'Not', 'least', 'dude', 'also', 'mean', 'rendition', 'Benny', 'Jets', 'even', 'words', 'are', 'made-up', 'gobbledy-gook', 'ol', 'Cyclops', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'romantic', 'leading', 'man', 'role', 'how', 'funny', 'Benny', 'Jets', 'bar', 'scene', 'best', 'moment', 'film.27', 'DRESSES', 'just', 'bit', 'FOUR', 'WEDDINGS', 'AND', 'A', 'FUNERAL', 'vibe', 'going', 'only', 'woman', 'perspective', 'pretty', 'funny', 'film', 'even', 'managing', 'plant', 'few', 'gentle', 'digs', 'wedding', 'industry', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'title', 'dig', 'what', 'Jane', '27', 'dresses', 'end', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'talent', 'type', 'role', 'good', 'enough', 'actress', 'audience', 'yearning', 'self-sacrificing', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'maybe', 'even', 'squirm', 'sadly', 'sister', 'fling', 'boss', 'evolve', 'something', 'more', 'serious', 'think', 'need', 'see', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedies.Malin', 'Akerman', 'WATCHMEN', 'Silk', 'Spectre', 'II', 'good', 'thankless', 'role', 'younger', 'self-absorbed', 'sister', 'Tess', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'again', 'out', 'park', 'snarky', 'best', 'friend', 'take', 'also', 'rocked', 'role', 'in13', 'Going', '30', 'Fun', 'Flirty', 'Edition', 'starred', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'girl', 'not', 'afraid', 'looking', 'silly', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'though', 'plays', 'nice', 'guy', 'here', 'up', 'pretty', 'dull', 'boring', 'dude.Special', 'Features', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Jane', 'hailing', 'cab', 'only', 'have', 'someone', 'jump', 'ahead', 'Jane', 'trying', 'bridesmaid', 'dress', 'Tess', 'wedding', 'Tess', 'accidentally', 'almost', 'sending', 'Gatsby', 'George', 'huge', 'pet', 'doggy', 'heaven', 'Wedding', 'Party', 'Making', 'featurette', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Wear', 'Again', 'costume', 'design', 'featurette', 'Jane', 'World', 'set', 'design', 'featurette', 'Running', 'Brides', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Filene', 'Basement', 'bargain', 'store', 'hectic', 'annually-held', 'one', 'day', 'wedding', 'gown', 'sale.27', 'DRESSES', 'chick', 'flick', 'familiar', 'see', 'where', 'going', ""'m"", 'saying', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'so', 'likeable', 'end', 'up', 'forgiving', 'been', 'there/done', 'storyline', 'girls', 'know', 'three', 'love', 'movie', ""'re"", 'dude', ""'ll"", 'score', 'high', 'points', 'pop', 'player', 'date', 'night', 'date', 'night', 'should', 'probably', 'take', 'out', 'lobster', 'something', 'instead', 'staying', 'home', 'watching', 'movies']",N/A

1149583,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B0015I2RSO,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[7, 7]","I'll admit it.  Despite being a somewhat cynical, heterosexual male, I do have a soft spot for romantic comedies.  I am certainly willing to shoot down the ones that are absolute crap, such as Kate and Leopold, or Maid in Manhattan, but I also have a very hard time turning You've Got Mail off when it comes on my HBO.  So armed with a light, since-Roswell crush on Katharine Heigl and a close lesbian friend who serves as a great fake girlfriend, I found myself at a screening of  27 Dresses, the new romantic comedy from writer Aline Brosh McKenna.The movie has not been very well reviewed, and I went in with very low expectations.  With that in mind I did enjoy it.  I have not been very impressed with the slate of RomComs that have been dumped on us in the past few years, with such absolute drivel as Must Love Dogs and A Lot Like Love, but I was able to enjoy 27 Dresses despite a couple of script errors, and the blatant even to me anti-feminist notion that the importance of its protagonist as a person seems entirely wrapped up in whether or not she can find herself a husband. An odd contrast from McKenna's previous film, the adaptation of The Devil Wears Prada, which commented on the struggle of women to hold power without isolating themselves from human connection.A few things are out of whack in the script; I am willing to overlook the flawed logistics of the opening sequence where Heigl hires a cab to commute her between two simultaneous weddings, as it is an effective way of showing us the lengths she will go to in an effort to give every bride she knows what they need for their weddings.  However, one major plot point of the movie is that Marsden, as a writer for the ""Commitments"" section of a popular newspaper, attends weddings and interviews the bridal parties for his column, yet Heigl, the maid of honor at a wedding he is writing about in the beginning, does not know who he is when they meet.  Also, Heigl's character is painted as having basically no social life, being at the beck and call of her boss whom she secretly loves, yet she apparently knows enough people to have been the maid of honor or at least a very involved bridesmaid in 27 weddings so far.  Where exactly did she meet all these other women, when it seems her only friend in the world is the perennial best-friend Judy Greer (brilliant, as always, I should add.)The reason why it does work is the chemistry between Heigl and the male romantic lead James Marsden, who I am rarely a fan of, which is an actual believable romantic connection, unlike the attempted chemistry between original object of Heigl's affection, Edward Burns, and her sister played by the human bobblehead doll Malin Akerman (seriously, what school of acting did she go to that taught her your head must always move whilst talking?) As much as I am a fan of Burns, I really only think he works as a tough Irish cop or taxi driver, and always seems to fall short as someone who is supposed to actually be loveable.The movie makes use of two way over-done RomCom staples, that being the clothing-montage and the group singing scene, yet somehow they both work and do more than just fill time between banter.  I will confess to being something of a sucker for an earned sing-along scene; I will defy any one to try and shake my love of a bus full of 70's musicians singing Tiny Dancer, and indeed I quite enjoyed this movie's rendition of Benny and the Jets. The sing along scene, which takes place in an upstate New York dive-bar, also contains perhaps my favorite extras in any movie ever, so noticeable in how much they are enjoying the singing of Marsden and Heigl that I began to watch them more than the leads.One thing the movie does that I found myself very impressed by is that in the climax, our protagonist does something that is absolutely wrong of her to do, regardless of how awful her sister is.  Typically in a movie such as this, a move in the same part of the script is something done with the best intentions or even more often, as is the case of most Ben Stiller moviesRye Silverman, the result of things happening that make their own efforts fall apart, Heigl's character does something that is nothing short of personal sabotage, and I have to give a bit of applause to McKenna for taking that direction, of making us see our heroine as someone who can actually do something cruel or manipulative and selfish without making us hate her for it.",4,"That's Right, We're Reviewing

I'm sorry, it just doesn't happen as frequently as the movies would have us believe.  Women like Katherine Heigl get boyfriends on demand.  Nonetheless, Jane spends all her time helping her less attractive friends get hooked up, find love, and plan all the details of upcoming weddings.  She's so dedicated, in fact, that she participated in two weddings at the same time, enlisting the help of a voyeuristic cabbie to usher her back and forth in a mobile dressing room.Meanwhile, she pines all along for her own knight in shining armor, wishing to wear the gown instead of the bridesmaid's dress.  With utmost devotion and desperation, she plans on finding her man by cleaning her home, hanging up her perpetual string of hideous dresses, and reading her favorite author: the guy who writes the sappy wedding announcements in the city paper.In walks Malcolm (James Marsden), a cynical beat-writer who witnessed Jane's aforementioned wedding double-dip, and later ends up sharing a cab with her.  In a near blatant rip-off of Serendipity, she leaves her date book in the cab, and Malcolm learns all about her sordid wedding past.Around this same time, Jane's whorish, unreliable sister Tess shows up in time to seduce the man of Jane's dreams, her boss George (Edward Burns).  Conveniently enough, Malcolm would love to write about not only the nuptials between George and Tess, but also Jane's Masochist collection of dresses.Insert ubiquitous dress-fittings, a fun drunken karaoke scene, inevitable strife in the crazy double love triangle, an all too convenient apology after a sabotaged wedding, a perfect second wedding (albeit a bit corny), and the result is a contrived chick-flick that's nearly impossible to dislike.

She has come a long way since performing in horror fare such as ""The Bride of Chucky"" and ""Valentine.""  The uttered the word ""gorgeous"" when I first saw her.  She has the perkiness and cuteness of Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts all rolled up into one.  The handsome James Marsden of ""The Notebook"" is a star in his own right.  Together, Marsden and Heigl make the most attractive couple I've seen since Alec Baldwin and Kim Bassinger.In ""27 Dresses,"" Heigl is Jane Nichols who is the proverbial ""always the bridesmaid but never the bride.""  She has been a bridesmaid 27 times.  Jane has a secret crush on her cute boss George (Edward Burns of ""The Holiday"" and ""Life or Something Like It"").  Unfortunately, he is smitten by Jane's ""overbearing, overindulged"" sister, Tess.  Unable to say ""no"" to anyone, Jane must plan her sister's wedding to the man she loves.  Then she meets the cynical Kevin Doyle who hates weddings.  Unknown to her, he writes tearful, heart-warming wedding articles for the Commitments section of the New York Times under the pseudonym, Malcolm Doyle; she is his number one fan.  Later, she feels betrayed when she discovers he's written an article about her having been a bridesmaid 27 times.""27 Dresses"" reminded me of ""How to Lose a Man in 10 Days.""  There is a since of betrayal and dishonesty involving a written article that reveals someone`s weaknesses.  It also reminded me of ""The Wedding Planner.""  It's difficult to plan weddings and not be the one who's getting married, like building race cars and not being able to drive them in competition.""27 Dresses"" was an uplifting, emotional movie.

The two films share a love of wedding details and the romance of the moments...all the moments leading up to the trip home from the honeymoon.I happen to fall somewhere in that category so I liked 27 Dresses. Some of it I liked a lot. Jane and Kevin have a sweet and spicy relationship that comes off as believable. Katherine Heigl also plays the part of a martyr with some great facial comedic moments. I liked the flavor and personality of the film and had fun watching it. I appreciated that I didn't have to watch sex, though I heard a bit about it, and there were behind the scenes moments.I didn't care for Jane's sister Tess and didn't buy into the passive aggressiveness of the relationship and Tess's extreme selfishness. I didn't buy Jane's long-term crush on George either. Jane's best friend claims to have a defective moral compass and demonstrates that throughout the film. Don't get me wrong, she's funny, but it's not humor for your great-grandma or your ten year old. There are several s-words sprinkled throughout and an F-Bomb is muffled during a massive Jane meltdown.Overall, 27 Dresses is a fun movie that falls into the PG13 category for a reason. It is one of those that a group of women can pop in while they gorge on chocolate and popcorn and paint their nails (hopefully not at the same time). Or a fun date night if you don't get embarrassed with innuendo and outright crude comments.

I won't say how, but most any other actress would have brought the movie down with her at that point, for it is truly an ugly revelation.  But somehow Heigl manages to retain the audience's sympathy.Did I miss something, or was there really no answer to Malcolm asking Jane how she was able to afford to go to so many weddings (he mentions the airfare alone would have blown the budget for many women at Jane's career level.)  She sort of brushes him off, but I expected some sort of payoff about this question, for it was just unbelievable.  Don't you love when glamorous Tess comes to her sister's apartment straight from Milan, and she looks in and gushes about how cute and tiny it is!  The two actresses make that scene work for the moment, but then on to later reels of the movie where it turns out that Jane has New York's biggest apartment!  Well, nearly so, I think the title for the biggest apartment still belongs to the one that Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler (who were also supposed to be struggling New Yorkers) lived in at the beginning of PS I LOVE YOU, the last chick flick I watched.Edward Burns was OK, but I imagine his casting was the result of some free association down at the casting office.  ""OK, his name is GEORGE... let's get BURNS..."" for otherwise he was not that good.  As for James Marsden, he's cute in a way, a little fellow, but now so alarmingly thin that every bone in his face sticks out, not just his cheekbones but bones you were never meant to see.

1149608,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0015I2RSO,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[12, 13]","""27 Dresses"" is not the greatest romantic comedy to hit the screen.  It's predictable, by-the-book and adds nothing new to the genre.  You have the confident-on-the-surface, always reliable, never-loved leading lady, Jane (Katherine Heigl), the annoying and spoiled little sister (Malin Akerman), the protective best friend (Judy Greer), the oblivious love interest (Edward Burns), and the bad seed who turns out to be the good guy (James Marsden).  What makes ""27 Dresses"" better than all of the other films that clutter the romantic comedy genre is the fact that these stereotypical characters are played to perfection by their respective actors and actresses.Heigl demands your attention whenever she is on the screen.  Whether it's her beauty or her acting prowess, you cannot look away when she's in a scene.  She makes a perfect team with James Marsden, who I've always personally felt has been underused as an actor.  Akerman is the perfect spoiler to all of the fun, and proves that the failure of ""The Heartbreak Kid"" was more due to the story itself and not her performance in it.  Edward Burns is his old reliable self, and even though his is one of the thinnest characters in the film, he's still a joy to watch.  My personal favorite of the whole bunch, however, is Judy Greer as Jane's best friend.  Her character is perhaps the most stock of the lot, but she pulls it of with flair and fun.The story, as I've already stated, is run-of-the-mill.  It wouldn't surprise me to stumble on clones of this film on WE, Oxygen or even ABC Family.  Heigl is always the bridesmaid and never the bride and when her sister moves in on a potential love interest, things start hitting the fan.  Toss in a relentless reporter who writes a wedding column, and you have a fun though formulaic film.""27 Dresses"" is a solid four star film.  It proves that you can take a standard love story and build it into something special thanks to excellent direction and acting.

It follows the story of a girl who is in love with being in love and the procession of a wedding. It maybe because she lost her mother at a young age, or it maybe because she is in love with her boss, who dependant on her in the work place but not aware of her in matters of the heart.James Marsden is a skeptical struggling news reporter who is tired of covering the wedding section of a major newspaper chain. He secretly scoffs at the ridiculous measures that women will go to have ""the perfect wedding"", even though his articles are the stuff that describes marital bliss as being touched by Heaven. He bumps into Katherine Heigls character at a wedding and is amused by her serious undertaking of being the ""perfect"" bridesmaid. At the same time he become unknowningly smitten with her, he decides to base an article that sheds light on how ridiculous some women become with their desire for ""fairy tale love and marriage"".Enter Katherin Heigl's sister who is coming to visit, and is immediately attracted to Hiegl's boss who is too aware of the opulent attractive sister. Hiegl is heartbroken and miffed and the stage is set for the film which touches the heart and tickles the funny bone.This is a quintessential film for those who love FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, THE WEDDING PLANNER, RUNAWAY BRIDE, MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING and other romantic comedies.There are some truly hilarious moments and some tender poignant scenes as well. The viewer finds himself or herself, whatever the case maybe, cheering on Heigl to achieve her heart's desire throughout the obstacles of the film. Hiegl truly shows in this film that she indeed has star power rivaling Reese Witherspoon and Julia Roberts for the romantic comedy genre.This is not just a chick flick, men should take note as well and will probably enjoy it as well, even though it might be a guilty pleasure for them.

Judy Greer is as good as always (she plays Janes friend Casey) and the rest of the cast do well too.  It doesn't hurt that Ed Burns is a very good looking guy and acted pretty well in this.

She holds the so-so movie together -  but it takes more than her natural acting ability and presence to make this movie's mojo.  It could have been much better27 Dresses is a bland story about a good, selfless, generous young woman who is a door mat to her friends, family and co-workers.  This tale is how Jane finds true love.  Jane is always the bridesmaid, never a bride - and has 27 dresses to prove it.  Her closet is stuffed with eclectic colorful and themed bridesmaid's dresses.  There is a series of clipped scenes of her putting on the dresses for a fashion show just for Malcom (James Marsden) the Bridal Fashion Report for the New York Journal.  For some reason this reminded me of the 50's/60's Katy Keene comic book showing Katy in several far-out dresses in every issue.Anyway... Jane lives in New York City, has a good job with a boss, George (Edward Burns), that she has a romantic interest in.  Jane is also a ""good girl"" with many friends who keep her busy as a perennial bridesmaid/maid of honor.  Jane also has a younger sister, Tess,  (Malin Akerman) who is a spoiled pretty blond minx who is between jobs and needs a place to stay.  She joins Jane at a party her boss also attends.  Tess and Jane's boss hit it off - and it becomes serious.  Soon Tess and George become engaged and plan a wedding - you guessed it - Jane is the Maid of Honor.Malcolm (James Marsden) notices Jane at a wedding - amazed she is hopping cabs to be a bridesmaid at two weddings the same night.  He writes a newspaper's wedding column and smells an interesting story brew.  Malcom finds Jane's date book in one of the cabs she used to changes wedding attire and begins to shadow her for the story.  He does not let Jane know that is why he is following her and eventually develops a romantic interest and wants to be with her.  Jane is more interested in her boss, and ignores Malcolm but they eventually meet up, drive a car off the road in a rain storm, end up at a bar drunk and you can guess the rest.Malcolm's boss prints his ""draft"" of the ""perennial bridesmaid"", which is Jane and Jane sees it the next morning -  much drama follows but you can guess the ending.",2,"Bland Script, Filled with Cliches",1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,2223,"['Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Jane', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'so-so', 'movie', 'together', 'more', 'natural', 'acting', 'ability', 'presence', 'make', 'movie', 'mojo', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better27', 'Dresses', 'bland', 'story', 'good', 'selfless', 'generous', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'door', 'mat', 'friends', 'family', 'co-workers', 'tale', 'how', 'Jane', 'true', 'love', 'Jane', 'always', 'bridesmaid', 'never', 'bride', '27', 'dresses', 'prove', 'closet', 'stuffed', 'eclectic', 'colorful', 'themed', 'bridesmaid', 'dresses', 'series', 'clipped', 'scenes', 'putting', 'dresses', 'fashion', 'show', 'just', 'Malcom', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Bridal', 'Fashion', 'Report', 'New', 'York', 'Journal', 'reason', 'reminded', ""50's/60"", 'Katy', 'Keene', 'comic', 'book', 'showing', 'Katy', 'several', 'far-out', 'dresses', 'issue.Anyway', 'Jane', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'good', 'job', 'boss', 'George', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Jane', 'also', 'good', 'girl', 'many', 'friends', 'who', 'keep', 'busy', 'perennial', 'bridesmaid/maid', 'honor', 'Jane', 'also', 'younger', 'sister', 'Tess', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'who', 'spoiled', 'pretty', 'blond', 'minx', 'who', 'jobs', 'place', 'stay', 'Jane', 'party', 'boss', 'also', 'Tess', 'Jane', 'boss', 'hit', 'off', 'serious', 'Soon', 'Tess', 'George', 'become', 'engaged', 'plan', 'wedding', 'guessed', 'Jane', 'Maid', 'Honor.Malcolm', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Jane', 'wedding', 'amazed', 'hopping', 'cabs', 'be', 'bridesmaid', 'two', 'weddings', 'same', 'night', 'newspaper', 'wedding', 'column', 'interesting', 'story', 'brew', 'Malcom', 'Jane', 'date', 'book', 'one', 'cabs', 'used', 'changes', 'wedding', 'attire', 'shadow', 'story', 'not', 'let', 'Jane', 'know', 'why', 'following', 'eventually', 'romantic', 'interest', 'be', 'Jane', 'more', 'interested', 'boss', 'Malcolm', 'eventually', 'meet', 'up', 'drive', 'car', 'road', 'rain', 'storm', 'end', 'up', 'bar', 'drunk', 'can', 'guess', 'rest.Malcolm', 'boss', 'draft', 'perennial', 'bridesmaid', 'Jane', 'Jane', 'next', 'morning', 'much', 'drama', 'can', 'guess', 'ending']",N/A

In this age of 'equality' and supposed new heights of achieved feminism, here is a film so flimsy, so cheap, and so weak, that it paints women as feeble caricatures of themselves - the women in this film are nothing without men, and the prime goal of human life is to get married (forever) to one man, and one man alone.Now whether this is or is not what women want these days (I'm guessing most women are smarter than this), the film shamelessly steals lines and scenes from far superior chick flicks before it (seriously, its like one big C-Grade rehash of ""Pretty Woman"", ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and ""13 Going on 30""). The lead actress' obsession with weddings is a little worrisome, and it gets worse when they bring in her bleach-blonde dimwit of a sister, and the movie pretty much runs like a sicker version of the Cameron Diaz starrer ""In her Shoes"" from that point on (and not in a good way).Granted there is an audience for this trash. I can imagine 10 year old girls wearing lace and tiaras being forcefed this nonsense by their equally head-in-the-clouds moms (I am also guessing these are the same moms who listen to the ""High School Musical"" soundtracks they supposedly buy for their children). Poor things. Humanity certainly deserves better than this. The first time I saw it, I was offended at the really bad script, and then watched in horror as the film played out EXACTLY how I expected it to. The male lead here is James Marsden, an actor who always gets the girl, and we know it from scene one.What is more disgusting is that Katherine Heigl (who was just luminous in ""Roswell"" and later in ""Grey's Anatomy"") is stripped of her natural acting ability and told to act EXACTLY like Calista Flockhart on every episode of ""Ally Mc Beal"" ever made. Seriously. The Calista comparison is very, very valid, and I almost expected Lucy Liu to jump into the frame at some point and plant one on her. The tendency to have chick flicks with a 'goofy', 'relatable' and 'likeable' lead character is understandable. This has been a running motif in almost every sleazy chick flick to date. But this movie breaks new ground in disrespecting your intelligence, and rubbing your nose in their twisted belief that you simply must get married, and it has to be the white wedding from hell no less.All actors in this enterprise deserved better. Especially hideous was Katherine's 'best friend' who is played by the same actress who played Jennifer Garner's 'best friend' in '13 Going on 30'. They even give her the SAME LINES! Its a scene-for-scene copy of that film in these segments, and I could not believe people haven't picked up on this movies' rampant thievery of dumb lines from other films. Unbelievable.In fact, this entire film is unbelievable. Here is Katherine Heigl trying on her 27 dresses in a montage segment that EVERY chick flick just has to have, in some sort of belief that these sorts of 'dress rehearsal' scenes are necessary to even obtain a chick flick tag. Here is Katherine again, sobbing away as the man she loves falls in love with her sister. Here is Katherine brushing off the guy she is meant to be with, only to realize later on that he is 'the one'. If you have the patience for this sort of high school nonsense, then more power to you. I'd rather listen to Obama's wonderful race speech again.""27 Dresses"" is an insult to the world of romantic comedies, and all involved with this project should be barred from future Hollywood ventures. Back to obscurity, is what I say.Two Stars.

But the one thing about it that most people never mention is...who cares? Such is the case with 27 DRESSES.Katherine Heigl stars as Jane Nichols, an over efficient right hand for publisher George (Ed Burns). Jane also happens to be the perpetual always a bridesmaid never a bride friend. She organizes and officiates weddings for all of her friends, performing all tasks to a T.The thing is Jane has a major crush on her boss George. And George never looks at Jane in that way. He does, however, feel the onset of love at first site when he gets a glimpse of Jane's sister, Tess (Malin Akerman). Tess is visiting and without having a clue how Jane feels, ends up romantically involved with George.Tossed into this mix is Kevin Doyle (James Marsden), a wedding reporter for the New York Journal who longs to write more meaningful stories. When he bumps into Jane at a wedding (one of two she's handling the same night) he accidentally comes into possession of her notebook containing all the information on her many social duties. Seeing a story, he pitches it to his editor and gets the go ahead.The usual romantic comedy ensues, with George and Tess getting closer as Jane watches on, everyone oblivious to her feelings. The self centered Tess lies to George to get the guy, Jane covers for her and Kevin covers the story of the wedding after George proposes.Jane is the good girl, the one who can never say no. As she sees her dreams being crushed, she also finds herself attracted to Kevin, unknowingly of course. The feelings between the two deepen, but the untold truths between both couples will come round front and center with dire consequences.The movie follows a fairly stereotypical set up and continues through to the very end. But it's not the newness of the story that brings us round to watch this film, it's the telling of the tale.Heigl and Marsden do a great job as the off kilter couple who struggle until the final reel to find one another. Malin turns in a good performance as well as the selfish sister who seems to think only of number one. Burns does the same thing he does in all performances, making it seem easy.Perhaps this movie plays like an episode of any number of TV sitcoms that have aired for years. But it still offers plenty of fun, plenty of laughs and enough romance to keep everyone interested. It's not Shakespeare but it never claims to be. Instead, it's a nice movie that is perfect for a couple's night at home.",3,DRESSED TO KILL,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,2556,"['occasion', 'movie', 'out', 'totally', 'predictable', 'leaving', 'few', 'surprises', 'viewer', 'one', 'thing', 'most', 'people', 'never', 'mention', 'who', 'Such', 'case', '27', 'DRESSES.Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Jane', 'Nichols', 'efficient', 'right', 'hand', 'publisher', 'George', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'Jane', 'also', 'be', 'perpetual', 'always', 'bridesmaid', 'never', 'bride', 'friend', 'weddings', 'friends', 'performing', 'tasks', 'T.The', 'thing', 'Jane', 'major', 'crush', 'boss', 'George', 'George', 'never', 'Jane', 'way', 'however', 'feel', 'onset', 'love', 'first', 'site', 'when', 'glimpse', 'Jane', 'sister', 'Tess', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'Tess', 'visiting', 'having', 'clue', 'how', 'Jane', 'feels', 'up', 'romantically', 'involved', 'George.Tossed', 'mix', 'Kevin', 'Doyle', 'James', 'Marsden', 'wedding', 'reporter', 'New', 'York', 'Journal', 'who', 'write', 'more', 'meaningful', 'stories', 'When', 'Jane', 'wedding', 'one', 'two', 'handling', 'same', 'night', 'accidentally', 'possession', 'notebook', 'containing', 'information', 'many', 'social', 'duties', 'Seeing', 'story', 'editor', 'go', 'ahead.The', 'usual', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'ensues', 'George', 'Tess', 'getting', 'closer', 'Jane', 'watches', 'everyone', 'oblivious', 'feelings', 'self', 'centered', 'Tess', 'George', 'get', 'guy', 'Jane', 'Kevin', 'story', 'wedding', 'George', 'proposes.Jane', 'good', 'girl', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'say', 'no', 'dreams', 'being', 'crushed', 'also', 'attracted', 'Kevin', 'unknowingly', 'course', 'feelings', 'two', 'deepen', 'untold', 'truths', 'couples', 'will', 'come', 'round', 'front', 'center', 'dire', 'consequences.The', 'movie', 'fairly', 'stereotypical', 'set', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'not', 'newness', 'story', 'round', 'watch', 'film', 'telling', 'tale.Heigl', 'Marsden', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'off', 'kilter', 'couple', 'who', 'struggle', 'final', 'reel', 'find', 'one', 'Malin', 'good', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'selfish', 'sister', 'who', 'think', 'only', 'number', 'one', 'Burns', 'same', 'thing', 'performances', 'making', 'seem', 'movie', 'episode', 'number', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'have', 'aired', 'years', 'still', 'plenty', 'fun', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'enough', 'romance', 'keep', 'everyone', 'interested', 'not', 'Shakespeare', 'never', 'be', 'Instead', 'nice', 'movie', 'perfect', 'couple', 'night', 'home']",N/A

The critics attacked it because they saw another movie that was always a bridemaid and never a bride. That is not how I saw this movie at all, even though you may see that in the premise. I see her not really looking so much for marriage as romance, and not so much at romance as much as pleasing her friends.She is in love with her boss, the very adorable Edward Burns, for whom I have had a crush on since I saw him in She's the One. When her sister comes to town, which I may say is the annoying part of the movie, I didnt like her in the Heartbreak Kid either, she seems like she is trying too hard. Anyway when her sister comes to town, she ends up meeting her boss, Edward Burns, and they fall in love and immediately plan a wedding for which she wants her sister to be a bridesmaid.Jane's best friend is awesome too, very sharp and funny while she helps her friend come to terms with what she really wants in life. It was hillarious in the beginning when you see Jane running between two different weddings as a bridesmaid for the same night, that is when you realize she has been a bridesmaid so many times that sometimes they fall on the same weekend.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[5, 6]","""27 dresses"" is a mildly entertaining comedy that doesn't really rise above average, but makes you laugh from time to time, and has some clever one liners  that are quite funny.The main character is Jane Nichols (Katherine Heigl), a woman that adores weddings, and has made a hobby out of being a bridesmaid. She would love to get married, and has already found the right man for her, George (Edward Burns), her boss. Unfortunately, he sees Jane as a friend, and falls head over heels in love for someone else, who happens to be Jane's younger sister, Tess (Malin Akerman). Things get even more confusing for Jane when Kevin (James Marsden), a handsome and somewhat cynical journalist that covers weddings, enters the picture.All in all, I can say that I liked ""27 dresses"", but that I'm not likely to watch it again anytime soon. My recommendation? If you hate ""chick flicks"", stay far away from this movie.

In this case, though, the substantial charm of the two leads--Heigl and Marsden--added a great deal more.  Heigl's character is addicted to weddings and is portrayed as sort of an offbeat character as a result.  What the wedding obsession really does is keep her from living her own life; she is always helping everyone else with their weddings and never moving forward toward her own.  Add to that an unrequited crush on her boss, and you have someone who is never going to have a real life unless something happens to change things.  That something is an unlikely attraction to Marsden's character--unlikely because he appears to hold views that are opposite to hers, not because he happens to be outrageously handsome, funny, and smart. While some reviewers have panned the movie because they see Heigl as pathetic in it, the fact is that everyone has some areas in their life where they are not everything they should be.  It's the exaggeration of that that makes this movie funny and endearing.  Most of us don't have a closet full of old bridesmaid dresses holding us back, but we may be holding onto other things that take the place of a real life.  Heigl and Marsden were both winsome and adorable in this movie, and although it was a typical ""chick flick,"" it was not sappy or boring.  There was an interesting edge to both characters that gave the movie some life and spontaneity.  I recommend it as an enjoyable viewing experience.  Would love to see both actors in another movie again soon.Update: I find I enjoy rewatching this movie every so often when I'm in the mood for a fun time, so I upped it to 5 stars.

Well this movie will take you on a ride of the ups and downs of just such an experience.Meet Jane a pushover to all those in her life and both her boss George and her sister Tess take great advantage of that.  It doesn't help that Jane loves her boss who doesn't know she is alive and instead starts dating Tess (Jane's selfish sister) as soon as she arrives in town.Most people would sense the tension but the good natured Jane lets her sister gush on and on not to mention following any requests she makes.  Granted she was used to taking care of her sister from a young age when their mother died but the sister doesn't seem to care about anyone but herself.Into the picture comes, Jane's romantic interest in one cynical matrimony reporter named Kevin that notices her while watching her balance two weddings.  There are some lighthearted laughs on her taxi adventures back and forth.  He ends up with her planner and makes a point of getting her attention even though she finds him a pest.  One of the highlights of this movie is his interview of her as she displays her collection of bridesmaid dresses by trying them on while he takes photos.The reporter Kevin and Jane end up arguing while driving too fast in a rain storm...hyrdoplaning off the road.  That sparks a night adventure where they actually get to talk, sing, and start to get to know each other better outside of the typical wedding atmosphere.My problems with this movie though are in the concept of romantic as much as comedy.  I do prefer a more family friendly movie where the characters actually date.  There just wasn't much anticipation, looks, or leading up to the event that brought the two together and they certainly didn't both care about each other at the time.  What is romantic about getting drunk with someone you barely know and then going from there?Comedy depends on your sense of humor which is mostly at Jane's expense.  Personally I wouldn't consider holding someone's wedding dress while they peed as funny.  The line of you can shorten the wedding or bridesmaid dress and use it again is overused and tiresome.

She's kept every one of her dresses, and she reads the ""Commitments"" section of the NY Journal with relish. She dreams of the day when she will walk down the aisle herself, wearing her mother's wedding gown and marrying George, her hunky boss at work (Edward Burns). Enter Tess, Jane's hot sister. It's nearly love at first sight for Tess and George, and Jane shortly finds herself planning their wedding. Ouch.Then Jane meets Kevin Doyle (James Marsden), a writer for the ""Commitments"" section of the journal. (You see where this is going.) As Jane learns to finally start saying ""no"" to people and stand up for what she wants and needs, she discovers her affection for Kevin. Pretty soon, she's planning her own happily ever after.Mmmmkay. This movie is sweet and trite. It's not BAD, per se, but it's all been done before, kwim? I noticed a while back that, in most of his films, Marsden never gets the girl? I think I get it now. He is too physically perfect. Stay with me here. There's nothing ""off"" about him - no slightly crooked nose, no patchy skin, no scars, nothing. You'd think this would be a tremendous advantage, right?

I found it insulting that the audience could believe that there exists a professional woman in NYC completely obsessed with everything that is shallow about weddings in such a way that she has time to attend/coordinate them and be so close to 27 brides that she gets asked to be in their wedding party. Not only is the romantic plot hard to believe, a man who has been so harshly cynical about weddings, and possibly marriage itself, falls for a woman that is marriage and wedding-crazy (because I guess men secretly adore women who are desperate to get married), but it also has the most ludicrous scenes between the ""lovers""!The worst scene, in my opinion, was the one where she tries all the dresses for him, complete with hair and make-up (Was he in her apartment for days?). At this point she barely knows him, doesn't trust him, she acts like she's embarrassed by the dresses, but she happily models for this stranger anyway? It doesn't make any sense. And even less sense that a man would be entertained by this. The whole courtship seems forced, not natural at all.Also unbelievable, the ""relationship"" that grows between the sister and the boss. How could a supposed intelligent, self-made man fall for a total air-head? He couldn't tell she wasn't really a vegetarian or liked to hike after a few weeks of dating? Why would the sister like him so much she's willing to lie about such basic stuff anyway? What a waste of Edward Burns.The only reason I watched this movie was because I loved ""the Devil Wears Prada"" and this is from the same screenwriter. What a difference. Whereas  ""Devil"" embraces the complexities of trying to keep a professional job and balance an actual relationship, this movie barely touches on anything that could possibly motivate the characters to do what they do or even ""love"" who they love.Sometimes it feels like they make these movies for teenagers and not for adults: People in professional jobs act anything but, relationships are extremely shallow, and couples fall in ""love"" just because.I'm all for romantic escapism, but I have my stupidity limits.",1,"Insulting Romantic ""Comedy""",1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,2153,"['can', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'women', 'actually', 'movie', 'found', 'insulting', 'audience', 'could', 'believe', 'professional', 'woman', 'NYC', 'completely', 'obsessed', 'everything', 'shallow', 'weddings', 'such', 'way', 'time', 'attend/coordinate', 'be', 'so', 'close', '27', 'brides', 'asked', 'be', 'wedding', 'party', 'Not', 'only', 'romantic', 'plot', 'hard', 'believe', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'harshly', 'cynical', 'weddings', 'possibly', 'marriage', 'woman', 'marriage', 'wedding-crazy', 'guess', 'men', 'secretly', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'desperate', 'get', 'married', 'also', 'most', 'ludicrous', 'scenes', 'lovers', 'worst', 'scene', 'opinion', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'dresses', 'complete', 'hair', 'make-up', 'Was', 'apartment', 'days', 'point', 'barely', ""n't"", 'trust', 'embarrassed', 'dresses', 'happily', 'models', 'stranger', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'even', 'less', 'sense', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'entertained', 'whole', 'courtship', 'forced', 'not', 'natural', 'all.Also', 'unbelievable', 'relationship', 'sister', 'boss', 'How', 'could', 'supposed', 'intelligent', 'self-made', 'man', 'fall', 'total', 'air-head', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'vegetarian', 'liked', 'hike', 'few', 'weeks', 'dating', 'Why', 'would', 'sister', 'so', 'much', 'willing', 'lie', 'such', 'basic', 'stuff', 'anyway', 'What', 'waste', 'Edward', 'Burns.The', 'only', 'reason', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'loved', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'same', 'screenwriter', 'What', 'difference', 'Devil', 'complexities', 'trying', 'keep', 'professional', 'job', 'balance', 'actual', 'relationship', 'movie', 'barely', 'anything', 'could', 'possibly', 'motivate', 'characters', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'even', 'love', 'who', 'love.Sometimes', 'make', 'movies', 'teenagers', 'not', 'adults', 'People', 'professional', 'jobs', 'anything', 'relationships', 'are', 'extremely', 'shallow', 'couples', 'fall', 'love', 'just', 'because.I', ""'m"", 'romantic', 'escapism', 'have', 'stupidity', 'limits']",N/A

She's dreamed of the day she'll walk down the aisle to see that delighted expression on her intended husband's face.George (Edward Burns) is the man Jane always hoped would be at the other end of the aisle.  He's Jane's boss and an entrepreneur who made his millions selling the kind of outdoor equipment he loves to use. He's a gentle soul, a selfless vegetarian who loves dogs and serves as a Big Brother to a great Hispanic kid named Pedro.Jane's getting practice for that big day.  So far, she's been a bridesmaid at 27 weddings.  That's 27 dresses in her apartment front closet--none she will ever wear again...well, none anyone should have had to wear in the first place.Enter Tess (Malin Akeman), Jane's baby sister. She and George fall in love at first sight when Tess comes for a 2-week sisterly visit.  Of course, George proposes and Tess accepts. But, Tess isn't quite what she's leading George to believe.  She doesn't like dogs.  She eats meat, and she's turning George's little brother into her personal cleaning service.And Jane--who is both jealous of her little sister and concerned about the lies Tess is telling to 'get her man' has to put the wedding together. Add to that the complication of Kevin (James Marsden), the bridal column journalist, who is following both Jane's  career as a bridesmaid and amateur wedding planner and Tess's wedding.""27 Dresses"" is a heartwarming and funny film that's both a good date movie and suitable for pre-teens.

Katherine Heigl was very good but I just didn't connect with her character.  I just found it odd that everyone was supposed to know that Jane was in love with her boss but her own sister DIDN'T KNOW??? I didn't like Jane's best friend either.

I was predispossed to like this because 1) I love romantic comedy, 2) I love Katherine Heigl (even as I'm cool on GREY'S ANATOMY), and 3) liked a lot of the supporting players, especially James Marsden and Judy Greer.  But the film was torpedoed by one dull scene after another.  I didn't have a bad time because Heigl is so likable even when most everything else isn't, but it wasn't enough to salvage the film.A lot of what was wrong with the movie could be seen almost immediately.  On the one hand, Heigl is seen attending two different weddings at exactly the same time, rushing back from one to the other in a taxi, changing her dress each time.  It was simply too silly to enjoy.  Not to mention logistically improbable.  On the other hand, it is almost impossible to buy Katherine Heigl as ""always a bridesmaid, never a bride.""  She is just too shockingly beautiful for that kind of role.  (Even when I first saw her on ROSWELL, I was amazed at how truly beautiful she was.  This was a show with an entire cast of remarkably attractive people, but even so she was in a class by herself.)Yeah, some hay is made of her possibly using attending other people's weddings as a way of distancing herself from taking a risk with her own life, but again, her extreme beauty would still only make her believable as someone rejecting a long string of suitors.  Instead, we get the impression that men weren't beating a path to her door.So, this was a movie with a perfect cast that was limited by a remarkably limited script.  Maybe someone should reassmble the cast and let them make a new movie with a different script and a new director.I have a theory as to why TV stars are in so many bad movies.  People like Katherine Heigl or Steve Carrell have very narrow windows in which they can make films.  If projects are at a particular stage of development, they might not be able to wait three or four months for a particular television actor to become available.  The actors are, therefore, forced to take pretty much what is available in the timeslot they have available.  So maybe this was the best thing that was available for Katherine Heigl in her GREY'S hiatus.  I'm sure if she weren't tied to GREY'S she'd have much better scripts available for her.  We'll find out when that show ends or when her contract allows her to leave.",3,Not nearly as good as it should have been,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,2401,"['was', 'distressingly', 'dull', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'was', 'predispossed', 'like', '1', 'love', 'romantic', 'comedy', '2', 'love', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'even', ""'m"", 'cool', 'GREY', 'ANATOMY', '3', 'liked', 'lot', 'supporting', 'players', 'especially', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'film', 'was', 'torpedoed', 'one', 'dull', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'time', 'Heigl', 'so', 'likable', 'even', 'when', 'most', 'everything', 'else', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'salvage', 'film.A', 'lot', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'almost', 'immediately', 'one', 'hand', 'Heigl', 'seen', 'attending', 'two', 'different', 'weddings', 'exactly', 'same', 'time', 'rushing', 'back', 'one', 'other', 'taxi', 'changing', 'dress', 'time', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'silly', 'enjoy', 'Not', 'mention', 'logistically', 'improbable', 'other', 'hand', 'almost', 'impossible', 'buy', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'always', 'bridesmaid', 'never', 'bride', 'just', 'too', 'shockingly', 'beautiful', 'kind', 'role', 'Even', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'ROSWELL', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'was', 'was', 'show', 'entire', 'cast', 'remarkably', 'attractive', 'people', 'even', 'was', 'class', 'Yeah', 'hay', 'made', 'possibly', 'using', 'attending', 'other', 'people', 'weddings', 'way', 'distancing', 'taking', 'risk', 'own', 'life', 'again', 'extreme', 'beauty', 'would', 'still', 'only', 'make', 'believable', 'someone', 'rejecting', 'long', 'string', 'suitors', 'Instead', 'get', 'impression', 'men', 'were', ""n't"", 'beating', 'path', 'door.So', 'was', 'movie', 'perfect', 'cast', 'was', 'limited', 'remarkably', 'limited', 'script', 'Maybe', 'someone', 'should', 'reassmble', 'cast', 'let', 'make', 'new', 'movie', 'different', 'script', 'new', 'director.I', 'have', 'theory', 'why', 'TV', 'stars', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'movies', 'People', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'have', 'very', 'narrow', 'windows', 'can', 'make', 'films', 'projects', 'are', 'particular', 'stage', 'development', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'wait', 'three', 'four', 'months', 'particular', 'television', 'actor', 'become', 'available', 'actors', 'are', 'therefore', 'forced', 'take', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'available', 'timeslot', 'have', 'available', 'So', 'maybe', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'was', 'available', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'GREY', 'hiatus', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', ""n't"", 'tied', 'GREY', ""'d"", 'have', 'much', 'better', 'scripts', 'available', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'when', 'show', 'when', 'contract', 'leave']",N/A

The lovely Katherine Heigl, of ""Knocked Up"" fame, plays Jane Nichols, a wedding consultant who has dedicated her life to turning other women`s dreams into matrimonial reality - though she has yet to make that fateful trip to the altar herself.  Complications arise when she meets a scruffy, jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing journalist who also just happens to be a diehard cynic about marriage (he considers it the ""last legal form of slavery"") and who, for reasons not related to either logic or credibility, has been assigned to the wedding beat of a popular Manhattan newspaper.  It's hate-at-first-sight on Jane's part, of course, made worse when the young man pens what amounts to a style-section hit piece on Jane and her soon-to-be-wed sister, Tess.  Eventually, however, after all the plot conniptions have been neatly sorted out, Jane comes to her senses and realizes that here, indeed, is that very man of her dreams she's been pining away for all these years.""27 Dresses"" latches onto just about every conceivable stereotype and clich&eacute; that this tired old genre can dish out:  the gorgeous, dreamy-eyed leading lady who, for reasons known only to the scriptwriter, cannot seem to land herself a man, let alone get one to go out with her; the sassy, acid-tongued best friend who talks dirty and sleeps around and can't understand why Ms. Right has to be so picky in her dating choices; the handsome but clueless boss who has no idea his loyal employee is madly in love with him; the self-centered kid sister who has always gotten any man she ever wanted, including the one on whom her older sibling has currently set her sights; and finally the debunker of romance and decrier of marriage who's really just a big old sentimental softie beneath the five-o'clock-shadow and cynical wisecracks.  (About the only stereotype who doesn't show up is the fussy, snarky old queen, a character who is practically de rigeur in these types of scenarios - but, then, seeing as Jane has already usurped the role of wedding planner, I guess there just wasn't any room left over for him in the cast of characters).And don't think we aren't treated to the obligatory trying-on-dresses musical montage sequence or the tear-stained finale in which the two principals finally declare their undying love for one another amidst a sea of applauding witnesses.Heigl, who was so charming in ""Knocked Up,"" looks merely uncomfortable in this instance as she and her fellow co-stars - James Marsden, Malin Akerman, Edward Burns - struggle manfully with both the strained dialogue and wheezy plot mechanics dreamed up by writer Aline Brosh McKenna and the sluggish, uninspired direction by Anne Fletcher.For all but those with the laxest standards when it comes to romance, ""27 Dresses"" is at least 27 dresses too many.",2,paint-by-numbers romantic comedy,1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,2967,"['*SPOILERS*The', 'romantic', 'comedy', '27', 'Dresses', 'skimpy', 'always', 'bridesmaid', 'never', 'bride', 'tagline', 'stretched', 'out', 'one-hour-and-fifty-minute-long', 'feature', 'film', 'lovely', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'fame', 'Jane', 'Nichols', 'wedding', 'consultant', 'who', 'dedicated', 'life', 'turning', 'other', 'women', 's', 'dreams', 'matrimonial', 'reality', 'yet', 'make', 'fateful', 'trip', 'altar', 'Complications', 'arise', 'when', 'scruffy', 'jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing', 'journalist', 'who', 'also', 'just', 'be', 'diehard', 'cynic', 'marriage', 'last', 'legal', 'form', 'slavery', 'who', 'reasons', 'not', 'related', 'logic', 'credibility', 'been', 'assigned', 'wedding', 'beat', 'popular', 'Manhattan', 'newspaper', 'hate-at-first-sight', 'Jane', 'part', 'course', 'made', 'worse', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'what', 'style-section', 'hit', 'piece', 'Jane', 'soon-to-be-wed', 'sister', 'Tess', 'Eventually', 'however', 'plot', 'conniptions', 'have', 'been', 'neatly', 'sorted', 'out', 'Jane', 'senses', 'here', 'indeed', 'very', 'man', 'dreams', 'been', 'pining', 'away', 'years', '27', 'Dresses', 'onto', 'just', 'conceivable', 'stereotype', 'clich', 'eacute', 'tired', 'old', 'genre', 'can', 'dish', 'out', 'gorgeous', 'dreamy-eyed', 'leading', 'lady', 'who', 'reasons', 'known', 'only', 'scriptwriter', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'land', 'man', 'let', 'alone', 'get', 'one', 'go', 'out', 'sassy', 'acid-tongued', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'dirty', 'sleeps', 'around', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Ms', 'Right', 'be', 'so', 'picky', 'dating', 'choices', 'handsome', 'clueless', 'boss', 'who', 'idea', 'loyal', 'employee', 'madly', 'love', 'self-centered', 'kid', 'sister', 'who', 'always', 'gotten', 'man', 'ever', 'wanted', 'including', 'one', 'whom', 'older', 'sibling', 'currently', 'set', 'sights', 'finally', 'debunker', 'romance', 'decrier', 'marriage', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'big', 'old', 'sentimental', 'softie', ""five-o'clock-shadow"", 'cynical', 'wisecracks', 'only', 'stereotype', 'who', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'fussy', 'snarky', 'old', 'queen', 'character', 'who', 'practically', 'de', 'rigeur', 'types', 'scenarios', 'then', 'seeing', 'Jane', 'already', 'usurped', 'role', 'wedding', 'planner', 'guess', 'there', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'room', 'left', 'over', 'cast', 'characters', '.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', ""n't"", 'treated', 'obligatory', 'trying-on-dresses', 'musical', 'montage', 'sequence', 'tear-stained', 'finale', 'two', 'principals', 'finally', 'declare', 'undying', 'love', 'one', 'amidst', 'sea', 'applauding', 'witnesses.Heigl', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'charming', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'merely', 'uncomfortable', 'instance', 'fellow', 'co-stars', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'struggle', 'manfully', 'strained', 'dialogue', 'wheezy', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'dreamed', 'up', 'writer', 'Aline', 'Brosh', 'McKenna', 'sluggish', 'uninspired', 'direction', 'Anne', 'Fletcher.For', 'laxest', 'standards', 'when', 'romance', '27', 'Dresses', 'least', '27', 'dresses', 'too', 'many']",N/A

The movie is very episodic so it hangs together like a set of chinese lanterns -- colorful but only loosely connected.  The characters are rather cliched and without any depth or strong definition.  Kevin provides the most entertainment and the only real sparkle to the film comes with the contentious verbal sparring between Kevin and Jane.  The parade of the 27 dresses was clearly the high point of the film and very entertaining.  Overall the film is OK and it is remarkable in that there are no car crashes, no mindless destruction of property, no graphic violence, and no weird creatures or dark sides.  There is only one instance of profanity which was clearly inserted solely to avoid the curse of a G rating.  The male characters are suitably unhygenic and generally need a shave.  Not only is their personal hygiene suspect but they are in desperate need of a clothing consultant.  Rumpled ill fitting clothes, shirt tails out, and untied ties may demonstrate ultra masculinity in Hollywood but it doesn't do that in a real professional environment or anywhere outside of People Magazine.  There is really very little originality here and as usual the action takes place in New York because as we all know life only exists in Los Angeles or New York.There are a few good scenes and one of the best is clearly the one in the car both during the spin out and the aftermath. The look of sheer terror on Kevin's face was very realistic as was the passion that followed.

1149679,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B0015I2RSO,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`27 Dresses' is a pretty basic chick flick about a woman (Jane) who is always a bridesmaid and never a bride. She has been a bridesmaid at 27 other weddings and has become an expert at helping a bride in her hour of need and yet she still hankers after her own `Mr Right'; and like any self respecting chick flick this film then follows her as she struggles to finds that man. Jane's sister throws a spanner in the works when she becomes engaged to the man Jane also loves. There is also a reporter who is writing about her sisters wedding who also writes about Jane`s long run of being a bridesmaid. That's the film in a nutshell and there's not a great deal more to it to be honest. Heigl plays the role of Jane well enough and James Marden plays the love interest without being too schmaltzy. This has a few laughs and a few more touching moments as well, so all the Rom-Com bases are covered.

The story is relatively bland and predictable and the performances seemed to have matched that level too.Katherine Heigl looks nice as the constant bridesmaid but the idea that she hasn't established that special relationship or that she just can't find the courage to tell the person that she most lusts after that she wants a relationship seems wrong.  Never mind the idea that just as she is working up the courage to make her move her sister (Melora Hardin, most recently co-starring in The Heart Break Kid alongside Ben Stiller) comes in and ruins the opportunity.Edward Burns makes an appearance here as Heigl's boss, and Brian Kerwin appears as the father of the two female leads.  Both are servicable in the roles they are asked to play, but either could just as easily be forgotten as they seem to mostly blend into the background and are minimized as the focus remains primarily on the female characters.James Marsden (Enchanted, Hairspray, Superman Returns, the X-men films, more...) has a slightly bigger role here, but he too is primarily relegated to the background.In the end the dresses themselves, 27 different bridesmaid dresses, make perhaps the biggest and flashiest co-stars in this film.  Heigl puts on a bit of a fashion show in the long line of hideous (intended to be so) bridesmaid dresses, along with several flashback scenes that show the dresses in character in all of the weddings that Heigl had been a part of.This isn't a bad film, but it certainly tilts heavily into 'Chick Flick' territory, more so than leaves it able to be recommended for date night (unless you want to do a double feature and make the second feature a testosterone laden male dominated feature).  2.5 stars (if half stars were possible).  More for fans of Heigl, but not much more.Picture quality on the Blu-ray is nice, audio quality and volume levels consistent and perfectly acceptable.

It's just not believable that anyone has 27 girlfriends, much less that they all get married, and you are a bridesmaid each time.  If they had made it 10 dresses, it would have already been too much...but 27....Please.Next problem the first 5 minutes of the movie, Jane (Katherine Heigl) attends two weddings on the same night.  Already stretching it, but more so when it's made clear she organized the 2 weddings.  She goes from one wedding to another changing each time in a taxi she has hired for the evening. Right, if she was planning these weddings and was so close to the brides, couldn't she convince one of them to have her wedding the next day?  Please....After this, there are all sorts of problems with character development.  Jane is supposed to be an extremely sweet person who can never say no; but the manner in which she decides to tell her sister's fiance the truth is so far out there, it's not credible even as an extreme case of repressed anger.Her life seems to revolve around being a bridesmaid, and reading the wedding editorials...they could have had her do this without it being the central focus of her life.  Even her ""love"" for her boss seemed to come second place to her obsession with weddings.Her boss falling in love with her sister is totally not credible.  She looks trashy in her too-short dresses.  Admitting that opposites attract (he an outdoors man and she a sophisticate), would be more acceptable if she looked a bit classier.  The way she was dressed most of the time was more conducive to a one-night stand than to a marriage proposal, which by the way came way too fast.The actor who plays Kevin gives an uneven performance.  It looked like he was acting sometimes.  But I blame the director for this...they should have re-shot some scenes.Worst of all, the dress changing scenes.  How many times do we have to rehash Pretty Woman?Ok, I know I'm not supposed to take these romantic comedies so seriously, but do they have to dumb them down so much?  Have any of these writers/directors ever watched ""When Harry met Sally""?  Please do, maybe you can learn a thing or two.Conclusion:  Watch if you like Katherine Heigl (only reason I gave it 3 instead of 2 stars) and are looking for a really light fare.Otherwise, skip it.",3,27 Dresses?!!!!!!

Good characterization, some exaggeration, conflict, resolution, and of course, a cast that seems believable should all be evident.In ""27 Dresses"", they are.  Katherine Heigel plays Jane, a perpetual bridesmaid who has been bridesmaid and helpful friend 27 times.  Most bridesmaids wear their dresses once, then hide them.  So has Jane.  Then one by one,  reporter Kevin Doyle learns about each of the weddings, and their associated dresses.  Enter her sister, Tess who falls in love with the man that Jane has secretly loved for a long time.  It's wedding time again, and one more time, she's a helpful bridesmaid with a little revenge on the side.This is clearly a date movie, a true chick flick.  Yet, in the process of watching the film, there are enough `this is not so bad' moments that even the guys who are dragged along can enjoy it. There is humor, there is romance, and there are moments of pure magic.  James Marsden (Corny Collins in Hairspray) gives a convincing performance as does Katherine Heigl.

1149694,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0015I2RSO,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Katherine Heigl is terrific as Jane, who has served as bridesmaid as many as 27 times. Sometimes she has to change her clothes in a cab because she has to attend more than one wedding in one day. Perhaps you know this kind of person, who just cannot say ""no"" even when she knows she should; who keeps these 27 dresses she wore in her closet; and, well, who is in love with her boss handsome George (Edward Burns), dreaming of the day when she would be the bride. But of course this will not be.That is because her younger sister Tess arrives and falls in love with George and he is also attracted to Tess to the chagrin of Jane. Moreover, Kevin (equally terrific James Marsden) a cynical news reporter reluctantly covering the weddings wants to write a story about her. And like many heroines in romantic comedies, Jane dislikes Kevin at first, but soon changes her mind. This is a formula established in the days of ""When Harry Met Sally...""The plot of ""27 Dresses"" follows the beaten path of romantic comedies, but that is not actually a bad thing. What is regrettable is that director Anne Fletcher (""Step up"") misses chances to make this film much more engaging than it is now. The film is occasionally funny and charming mostly thanks to two talented actors Heigl and Marsden, but supporting characters remain unmemorable, or worse, annoying.To me, what Tess does to Jane in the earlier part of the story looks too thoughtless and even obnoxious to be really funny. Hers is not the charming or delightful kind of thoughtlessness that would make you smile. Still worse, we (and Jane) are supposed to forgive Tess as Tess is, we are suddenly told as the film wraps up, not a bad person after all. Well, I know predictability is part of some (if not all) romantic comedy genre, but even so, you just cannot manipulate the way audiences feel about the characters in this crude fashion.Moreover, Edward Burns and Judy Greer are required to do little in the thin story while Burn's characters should be more attractive to make him Jane's crush and Greer's character's lines should be more witty and biting to make her Jane's friend. Luckily the considerable charms from Katherine Heigl and James Marsden somehow keep this film afloat, but still I couldn't help thinking that their inspired performances are wasted in ""27 Dresses.""",3,Terrific Katherine Heigl in Uninspired Romantic Comedy,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2329,"['Katherine', 'Heigl', 'terrific', 'Jane', 'who', 'served', 'as', 'bridesmaid', 'as', 'many', '27', 'times', 'Sometimes', 'change', 'clothes', 'cab', 'attend', 'more', 'one', 'wedding', 'one', 'day', 'Perhaps', 'know', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'even', 'when', 'should', 'who', '27', 'dresses', 'wore', 'closet', 'well', 'who', 'love', 'boss', 'handsome', 'George', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'dreaming', 'day', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'bride', 'course', 'will', 'not', 'be.That', 'younger', 'sister', 'Tess', 'love', 'George', 'also', 'attracted', 'Tess', 'chagrin', 'Jane', 'Moreover', 'Kevin', 'equally', 'James', 'Marsden', 'cynical', 'news', 'reporter', 'reluctantly', 'covering', 'weddings', 'write', 'story', 'many', 'heroines', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Jane', 'Kevin', 'first', 'soon', 'changes', 'mind', 'formula', 'established', 'days', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'plot', '27', 'Dresses', 'beaten', 'path', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'not', 'actually', 'bad', 'thing', 'What', 'regrettable', 'director', 'Anne', 'Fletcher', 'Step', 'up', 'chances', 'make', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'now', 'film', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'charming', 'mostly', 'thanks', 'two', 'talented', 'actors', 'Heigl', 'Marsden', 'supporting', 'characters', 'remain', 'unmemorable', 'worse', 'what', 'Tess', 'Jane', 'earlier', 'part', 'story', 'too', 'thoughtless', 'even', 'obnoxious', 'be', 'really', 'funny', 'Hers', 'not', 'charming', 'delightful', 'kind', 'thoughtlessness', 'would', 'make', 'smile', 'Still', 'worse', 'Jane', 'are', 'supposed', 'forgive', 'Tess', 'Tess', 'are', 'suddenly', 'told', 'film', 'up', 'not', 'bad', 'person', 'Well', 'know', 'predictability', 'part', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'even', 'so', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'manipulate', 'way', 'audiences', 'feel', 'characters', 'crude', 'fashion.Moreover', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'are', 'required', 'do', 'little', 'thin', 'story', 'Burn', 'characters', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'attractive', 'make', 'Jane', 'crush', 'Greer', 'character', 'lines', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'witty', 'biting', 'make', 'Jane', 'friend', 'Luckily', 'considerable', 'charms', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'James', 'Marsden', 'somehow', 'keep', 'film', 'afloat', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'inspired', 'performances', 'are', 'wasted', '27', 'Dresses']",N/A
