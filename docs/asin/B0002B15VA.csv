On Sunday, 17 Nov 1968, the NBC television network was scheduled to begin airing ""Heidi"" at 7pm Eastern Standard Time, following coverage of an American Football League game between the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders.The game ran long; however, with the Jets leading the Raiders, 32-to-29, NBC broke away to begin ""Heidi"" on schedule. During the remaining minute of play (which was extended by penalties and timeouts), Oakland managed to score two touchdowns, and ended up beating New York, 43-to-32.Outraged football fans inundated NBC switchboards. The network expressed regret, saying it had intended to stay with the football game until it ended, and blaming a series of miscommunications for the gaffe. A result of this fiasco is that NFL television contracts require games to be televised in their entirety. This game is now immortalized as the ""Heidi game.""",5,The little girl who changed the face of televised football,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,1054,"['Trivia', 'IMDB', 'was', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'Heidi', 'fault', 'own', 'became', 'embroiled', 'U.S.', 'broadcasting', 'brouhaha', 'known', 'day', 'Heidi', 'game', 'Sunday', '17', 'Nov', '1968', 'NBC', 'television', 'network', 'was', 'scheduled', 'begin', 'airing', 'Heidi', '7pm', 'Eastern', 'Standard', 'Time', 'following', 'coverage', 'American', 'Football', 'League', 'game', 'New', 'York', 'Jets', 'Oakland', 'Raiders.The', 'game', 'ran', 'long', 'however', 'Jets', 'leading', 'Raiders', '32-to-29', 'NBC', 'broke', 'away', 'begin', 'Heidi', 'schedule', 'remaining', 'minute', 'play', 'was', 'extended', 'penalties', 'timeouts', 'Oakland', 'managed', 'score', 'two', 'touchdowns', 'ended', 'up', 'beating', 'New', 'York', '43-to-32.Outraged', 'football', 'fans', 'inundated', 'NBC', 'switchboards', 'network', 'expressed', 'regret', 'saying', 'had', 'intended', 'stay', 'football', 'game', 'ended', 'blaming', 'series', 'miscommunications', 'gaffe', 'result', 'fiasco', 'NFL', 'television', 'contracts', 'require', 'games', 'be', 'televised', 'entirety', 'game', 'now', 'immortalized', 'Heidi', 'game']",N/A

It features first-rate actors, good production values, and sets and costumes that are contemporary enough not to lose the interest/attention of little kids but sufficiently authentic not to disgust older ones. Likewise, there is enough romance and suspense for older kids but not so much as to bore or confuse younger ones; a story line clear and linear enough for small children but not boring to older ones; sufficient but not intrusive emotional content and social commentary, etc. Altogether, this is a treat to watch, as I did with my grandchildren repeatedly for several years as they grew up.",5,charming production,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,731,"['would', ""n't"", 'presume', 'rate', 'Johanna', 'Spyri', 'timeless', 'tale', 'am', 'more', 'happy', 'say', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'excellent', 'first-rate', 'actors', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'contemporary', 'enough', 'not', 'lose', 'interest/attention', 'little', 'kids', 'sufficiently', 'authentic', 'not', 'disgust', 'older', 'ones', 'Likewise', 'enough', 'romance', 'suspense', 'older', 'kids', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bore', 'confuse', 'younger', 'ones', 'story', 'line', 'clear', 'linear', 'enough', 'small', 'children', 'not', 'boring', 'older', 'ones', 'sufficient', 'not', 'intrusive', 'emotional', 'content', 'social', 'commentary', 'etc', 'Altogether', 'treat', 'watch', 'did', 'grandchildren', 'repeatedly', 'several', 'years', 'grew', 'up']",N/A

Till now I've only seen bits and pieces of this movie on t.v. and had never seen the whole thing.  Decided to order it and enjoyed it very much. Jennifer Edwards might be a little too big for the role but she is so charming that you forget about it.  Michael Redgrave was perfect  as were Jean Simmons and Maximillian Schell.  Schell is so handsome he is worth watching the movie for.  This DVD has not apparently been remastered but seems to have been restored to some extent as it is quite an old movie and this DVD when played on my 60 inch t.v. still looks lovely.  Not as sharp and crisp as a fully remastered film but there are no scratches or fuzziness.  It may not be a total telling of the actual book because, as I said, I don't remember it all that well but it is a completely charming movie that I think everyone will enjoy very much. I certainly did. I saw a review in which the person writing in 2004 said that all of the movie was not on the DVD but on the copy I received it is all there so you can order without worry.",5,Wonderful version of this story,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,1145,"['been', 'least', '60', 'years', 'read', 'book', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'book', 'very', 'closely', 'Till', 'now', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'bits', 'pieces', 'movie', 't.v', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'whole', 'thing', 'Decided', 'order', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'Jennifer', 'Edwards', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'big', 'role', 'so', 'charming', 'forget', 'Michael', 'Redgrave', 'was', 'perfect', 'were', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Maximillian', 'Schell', 'Schell', 'so', 'handsome', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'DVD', 'not', 'apparently', 'been', 'remastered', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'extent', 'quite', 'old', 'movie', 'DVD', 'when', 'played', '60', 'inch', 't.v', 'still', 'lovely', 'Not', 'sharp', 'crisp', 'fully', 'remastered', 'film', 'are', 'scratches', 'fuzziness', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'total', 'telling', 'actual', 'book', 'because', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'that', 'well', 'completely', 'charming', 'movie', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'certainly', 'did', 'saw', 'review', 'person', 'writing', '2004', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'DVD', 'copy', 'received', 'there', 'can', 'order', 'worry']",N/A
829552,ALBJ1ST4216FI,B0002B15VA,"LME ""The Discerning Viewer""","[2, 3]","I have seen all the Heidi film versions and this one is the best overall.  Just as in Captains Courageous, the 1930's film with Freddie Bartholomew, Mickey Rooney, and Spencer Tracy captured the essence of the book without strictly following the plotline as written.So too, this film version gives us the spirit of Heidi, which, although not as bubbly as Shirley Temple, is loving, steadfast, obedient, and cheerful.  I think that the slightly more withdrawn part of her personality fits with her unstable upbringing, as she was shuffled from home to home and had no choice but to obey her Aunt Dete.  Her withdrawal seems to be natural under those circumstances.  The alm uncle (grandfather) is reserved because of past hurts and resentment in his life.  A real positive of this movie is that he attempts to resolve this inner conflict.  Now that he has a dependent in his life, he sees that his conflicts will be detrimental to her, and so out of love he works to overcome past issues.  He becomes a fine role model of a mature adult by the end of the movie.Clara is delightful (was it easier to find good child actors in the 60's and 70's?), Ms. Rottenmeier is a little too charming (but it works), Sebastian the butler does a fine job, and Clara's father, Mr. Sesseman is also excellent.  It is tough to single out a poor actor/actress in this version.For the record, my copy was VHS so I don't know if the DVD has been cut or if the picture quality suffered.Skip the 1993 Disney version.  It gets a little hocus pocus and does not have the feel of the book.  Heidi is petulant and worldly.  Peter's grandmother's part is very poorly written.  Clara and Peter are also worldly.  The book is absolutely charming.  What a contrast !!!See my review for the 2005 version as well.  The definitive film has not been made.  Masterpiece Theatre or BBC ought to tackle this project !!!!!!!!!",5,The Essence Of The Book,1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,1886,"['have', 'seen', 'Heidi', 'film', 'versions', 'one', 'best', 'overall', 'Just', 'Captains', 'Courageous', '1930', 'film', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'captured', 'essence', 'book', 'strictly', 'following', 'plotline', 'written.So', 'too', 'film', 'version', 'spirit', 'Heidi', 'not', 'as', 'bubbly', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'loving', 'steadfast', 'obedient', 'cheerful', 'think', 'slightly', 'more', 'withdrawn', 'part', 'personality', 'unstable', 'upbringing', 'was', 'shuffled', 'home', 'home', 'had', 'choice', 'obey', 'Aunt', 'Dete', 'withdrawal', 'be', 'natural', 'circumstances', 'alm', 'uncle', 'grandfather', 'reserved', 'past', 'hurts', 'resentment', 'life', 'real', 'positive', 'movie', 'resolve', 'inner', 'conflict', 'Now', 'dependent', 'life', 'conflicts', 'will', 'be', 'detrimental', 'so', 'love', 'overcome', 'past', 'issues', 'fine', 'role', 'model', 'mature', 'adult', 'end', 'movie.Clara', 'delightful', 'was', 'easier', 'find', 'good', 'child', 'actors', '60', '70', 'Ms.', 'Rottenmeier', 'little', 'too', 'charming', 'Sebastian', 'butler', 'fine', 'job', 'Clara', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Sesseman', 'also', 'excellent', 'tough', 'single', 'out', 'poor', 'actor/actress', 'record', 'copy', 'was', 'VHS', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'DVD', 'been', 'cut', 'picture', 'quality', 'suffered.Skip', '1993', 'Disney', 'version', 'little', 'hocus', 'pocus', 'not', 'have', 'feel', 'book', 'Heidi', 'petulant', 'worldly', 'Peter', 'grandmother', 'part', 'very', 'poorly', 'written', 'Clara', 'Peter', 'are', 'also', 'worldly', 'book', 'absolutely', 'charming', 'What', 'contrast', 'See', 'review', '2005', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'definitive', 'film', 'not', 'been', 'made', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'BBC', 'ought', 'tackle', 'project']",N/A
