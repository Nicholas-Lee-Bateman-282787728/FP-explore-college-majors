566690,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0000542C5,Acute Observer,"[0, 9]","Blue Sky, 1994 filmThe movie begins with pictures of women in magazines. Helicopters fly over a beach where a lone woman gets a tan. Then we see men in protective gear on sandy soil picking up small metallic rods. Major Henry Marshal has an attitude, his wife is from Virginia. We see an old Studebaker taxi, and a woman who enjoys attention. [The automobiles are from the late 1950s.] The couple arrive at a new army post. Will they fit in? They have two teenage girls. The wife has emotional problems. [Does she blame others for her problems?] Suitcases spill out of the back of a station wagon. ""Are you OK, dear?"" Carly sees radiation on her husband. ""Mom is tired, she needs a little rest."" The daughters recognize the problem. ""You're right, Dad."" Carly has a doll collection. Is her memory plastic? Carly returns with gifts. There is an outdoor garden party. How to keep looking young?There is a reference to the proposed nuclear underground testing ban. ""Its only make believe"" sings the band. Carly has another problem. ""An exceptional woman."" Can Henry cool off Carly? ""She had an accident."" Are they fighting to make up afterwards? A new nuclear test presents a crisis, Henry goes away for two weeks. Playing with a found grenade is a bad decision. [Is this credible?] They are caught. The underground test releases a lot of radiation. Two men on horseback intrude into the area. ""It's a crime."" Carly dances at a rehearsal. Is it too risqu&eacute;? ""Zip me up."" [Its easy to predict a bad ending to this story.] The older daughter dials her Dad so her Mom can tell all. The other officer's wives gossip about Carly. There is a conflict between Major Marshal and Colonel Johnson. [Is this believable?] Carly gets hurt. ""Hank is in big trouble.""Carly needs Henry. Can he be helped out of all this? Was it due to stress? A court-martial would be a disaster. Colonel Vincent Johnson gives an order. Carly and her daughters visit Henry, who is sedated like the other patients. Carly creates an incident at a parade. ""Is craziness inherited?"" Carly opens a locked briefcase then takes her girls on an early morning trip across country. She wants to make a fuss, but those two ranchers don't' agree with her. Carly leaves the motel to return to the ranch. A lone rider is at the test site! She is arrested, reporters see this. What will they do with her? Television news reports on Carly - the usual story from a press release. There is a shake-up at the army post. Henry is out of the hospital and the Army. ""Are you happy?"" Henry will become a Professor at a university in California. [Is this the end of their problems?]This could have been a better drama with a better and credible story. A military officer who questions the nuclear testing program? Personal conflicts between officers? An officer's wife who doesn't fit in? Changing attitudes and policies in the early 1960s? Suppose this movie used nerve gas testing instead of the nuclear bomb testing? I wonder if the reason for this movie was to create the worst movie that would still return a profit at the box office from those who go to any movie each weekend?

Lange plays a military wife to Tommy Lee Jones' career military man.  They have 2 children and have followed him from base to base.  What absolutely defines Lange's character though is a combination of constant sensuality with a personality that totters on the edge of breakdown.  She is hot for her husband, Jones, but she also acts like a sexual lodestar to other men.  Her very presence on a military base can cause incredible unrest among the other husbands and wives.

566701,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B0000542C5,Gregor von Kallahann,"[9, 10]","It's not always true, of course, but very often the Academy Awards'  ""Best Actress"" category proves one of the hardest to handicap, and therefore one of the most interesting.  The nominees in this category are frequently from ""smaller"" films, and are ofttimes the best thing about the movie.  Sure Jodie Foster's second win was for a commercial and critical blockbuster (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), but her first Oscar for the less heralded THE ACCUSED, which many critics found to be seriously flawed and wasn't exactly a runaway hit at the box office, but damned if she didn't earn that Oscar.  She was riveting in that film.Almost a decade later, Jessica Lange performed a similar achievement and walked off with an Academy Award for a ""smallish"" film that almost never saw the light of day. BLUE SKY, director Tony Richardson's final film, has powerful performances by Lange and Tommy Lee Jones (as her beleaguered husband) and a solid supporting cast is solid), but it suffers from a somewhat rickety storyline that gets increasingly implausible as the film goes on.Much of the movie is devoted to Hank and Carly Marshall's complex and largely dysfunctional family life, and those scenes are certainly compelling.  The dynamic between Jones' solid, supportive Hank and Lange's vulnerable Carly is somewhat reminiscent of  that of  Peter Falk and Gena Rowlands in Cassavetes A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE.  But BLUE SKY'S mad scene seems a little rushed--heck, it's not even ten minutes into the movie.  If Carly's going to break down by that point, we're either in for a lengthy psychodrama, or a sharp divergence in the plot.Turns out it's the latter.  What some have described as the film's nuclear coverup subplot pretty much becomes the main plot by the movie's end, serving to provide Carly a chance to find her own strength and to come to the rescue of her man.  Tricked by Hank's villainous commanding officer (the ever sinister Powers Boothe) into having her husband institutionalized, Carly can only redeem herself by taking bold initiative and effecting his escape.  It all gets a little preposterous plot-wise, but the strong performances, the sharp depiction of early 60s mores, manners and sexual politics make BLUE SKY well worth seeing.",4,"Sexual Politics, Nuclear Politics-Who Could Ask For More",1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,2249,"['not', 'always', 'true', 'course', 'very', 'often', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Actress', 'category', 'one', 'hardest', 'handicap', 'therefore', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'nominees', 'category', 'are', 'frequently', 'smaller', 'films', 'are', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Sure', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'second', 'win', 'was', 'commercial', 'critical', 'blockbuster', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'first', 'Oscar', 'less', 'heralded', 'THE', 'ACCUSED', 'many', 'critics', 'found', 'be', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'runaway', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'damned', 'did', ""n't"", 'earn', 'Oscar', 'was', 'riveting', 'film.Almost', 'decade', 'later', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'performed', 'similar', 'achievement', 'walked', 'off', 'Academy', 'Award', 'smallish', 'film', 'almost', 'never', 'saw', 'light', 'day', 'BLUE', 'SKY', 'director', 'Tony', 'Richardson', 'final', 'film', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Lange', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'beleaguered', 'husband', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'solid', 'somewhat', 'rickety', 'storyline', 'increasingly', 'implausible', 'film', 'on.Much', 'movie', 'devoted', 'Hank', 'Carly', 'Marshall', 'complex', 'largely', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'life', 'scenes', 'are', 'certainly', 'compelling', 'dynamic', 'Jones', 'solid', 'supportive', 'Hank', 'Lange', 'vulnerable', 'Carly', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Cassavetes', 'A', 'WOMAN', 'UNDER', 'THE', 'INFLUENCE', 'BLUE', 'SKY', 'mad', 'scene', 'little', 'rushed', 'heck', 'not', 'even', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Carly', 'going', 'break', 'down', 'point', ""'re"", 'lengthy', 'psychodrama', 'sharp', 'divergence', 'plot.Turns', 'out', 'latter', 'What', 'have', 'described', 'film', 'nuclear', 'coverup', 'subplot', 'pretty', 'much', 'main', 'plot', 'movie', 'end', 'serving', 'provide', 'Carly', 'chance', 'find', 'own', 'strength', 'come', 'rescue', 'man', 'Tricked', 'Hank', 'villainous', 'commanding', 'officer', 'ever', 'sinister', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'having', 'husband', 'institutionalized', 'Carly', 'can', 'only', 'redeem', 'taking', 'bold', 'initiative', 'effecting', 'escape', 'little', 'preposterous', 'plot-wise', 'strong', 'performances', 'sharp', 'depiction', 'early', '60s', 'mores', 'manners', 'sexual', 'politics', 'make', 'BLUE', 'SKY', 'well', 'seeing']",N/A

Juan La Princi""","[22, 29]","This movie is bizarre and out of whack, because it tries to fit a fascinating, Tennessee Williams-style character study into a tired, cliched paranoid conspiracy story.  But the movie is worth watching for its first half, when the focus is on the sexy, needy and dysfunctional marriage between the stolid, ambitious military engineer played by Tommy Lee Jones, and his attention-getting, Marilyn Monroe-like wife, played by Jessica Lange.Both Jones and Lange are excellent. Their characters have many responsibilities:  their children, their reputations at the military base, the protection of the Free World.  But the actors convince you that they would throw all of that over, temporarily, for each others' hot love.  But once you understand that, the filmmakers insert these great characters into a predictable, hackneyed plot that draws on ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Silkwood"" and the entirity of Oliver Stone's career.The hinge for all this is a very unwise sexual encounter between Lange's character and Jones' Evil Boss. The Evil Boss, played by Powers Boothe, is a real Snidely Whiplash.  From the first moment you see him, you know he's just a dastardly fellow without a conscience. Boo! Hiss!  By having sex with this Bad Man, and then believing another obvious lie he tells her, Lange unwittingly aids in the coverup of a nuclear accident, which she then must go to preposterous lengths to expose in order to save her husband from having his mind stolen from him by the Evil Boss.Some have wondered why this movie sat on the shelf for several years before being released, given that it won Lange an Academy Award.  The answer's obvious; the plot is an embarrassing joke.  But we should be glad it got released. Lange's performance is stunning, and Jones' is not far behind her. It's hard work to suspend disbelief through this story's many dumb moments (do you really think a lifelong army brat would pull the pin on a grenade and then casually toss it to her boyfriend?), but it's worth trying to, just to appreciate Jones and Lange's acting.",3,Tennessee Williams meets Oliver Stone,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2063,"['movie', 'bizarre', 'whack', 'fit', 'fascinating', 'Tennessee', 'Williams-style', 'character', 'study', 'tired', 'cliched', 'paranoid', 'conspiracy', 'story', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'first', 'half', 'when', 'focus', 'sexy', 'needy', 'dysfunctional', 'marriage', 'stolid', 'ambitious', 'military', 'engineer', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'attention-getting', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe-like', 'wife', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Lange.Both', 'Jones', 'Lange', 'are', 'excellent', 'characters', 'have', 'many', 'responsibilities', 'children', 'reputations', 'military', 'base', 'protection', 'Free', 'World', 'actors', 'convince', 'would', 'throw', 'temporarily', 'others', 'hot', 'love', 'once', 'understand', 'filmmakers', 'insert', 'great', 'characters', 'predictable', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Silkwood', 'entirity', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'career.The', 'hinge', 'very', 'unwise', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'Lange', 'character', 'Jones', 'Evil', 'Boss', 'Evil', 'Boss', 'played', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'real', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'first', 'moment', 'see', 'know', 'just', 'dastardly', 'fellow', 'conscience', 'Boo', 'Hiss', 'having', 'sex', 'Bad', 'Man', 'then', 'believing', 'obvious', 'lie', 'Lange', 'unwittingly', 'coverup', 'nuclear', 'accident', 'then', 'must', 'go', 'preposterous', 'lengths', 'expose', 'order', 'save', 'husband', 'having', 'mind', 'stolen', 'Evil', 'Boss.Some', 'have', 'wondered', 'why', 'movie', 'sat', 'shelf', 'several', 'years', 'being', 'released', 'given', 'won', 'Lange', 'Academy', 'Award', 'answer', 'obvious', 'plot', 'embarrassing', 'joke', 'should', 'be', 'glad', 'got', 'released', 'Lange', 'performance', 'stunning', 'Jones', 'not', 'far', 'hard', 'work', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'story', 'many', 'dumb', 'moments', 'do', 'really', 'think', 'lifelong', 'army', 'brat', 'would', 'pull', 'pin', 'grenade', 'then', 'casually', 'toss', 'boyfriend', 'worth', 'trying', 'just', 'appreciate', 'Jones', 'Lange', 'acting']",N/A

Prescott ""longplayer1""","[2, 3]","Thank Heavens this Sleeper was recognized by the Academy and Lange won the Best Actress Academy Award or this film would have went by the wayside, unseen and that would have been a complete shame for this classic. I was somewhat confused at first and didn't pick up on all the nuances of the script/plot and therefore, I opted to watch the film a second time, paying closer attention to detail and the motivation of the characters and ALL aspects of the intense plot. It was well worth the second watch! Lange definately deserved the Oscar for this performance but, I still can't believe that THIS is the film she finally gets the Oscar for! Oh well... a good performance deserves the kudos it gets and her incredible sexual smoldering in this film kept it interesting and is a good portrayal of what a wife will do when she's left to her own devices too often. No matter what anyone else says about the plot, it was pretty much how I remember the time that the film is set in, including the state of treatment for mental illnesses (the film doesn't pretty them up or horrify them like some do...it's pretty much just the facts, here), the nuclear issue, and the beginings of the era of free love and open sexuality...and so for that reason, I really enjoyed the film that much more. The main issue here is the incredible script, cinematography, and performances! Jones and Lange showed the deep down, dirty, gritty, fire and emotion that both of these fine, high caliber actors are capable of and I'm surprised that Tommy Lee Jones didn't take home a few awards for this film, himself. Also, what an incredible supporting cast! More like an ensemble....Chris O'Donnell, Carrie Snodgrass, Powers Boothe and the likes all turn in performances worthy of their abilities.

The story involves a military family in the early 60s who move to an Alabama base. The wife (Jessica Lange) is erratic & bipolar and behaves like a loony Marilyn Monroe while the husband (Tommy Lee Jones) is unshakably faithful. The two daughters lament their mother's disorder, but the family's strong nevertheless. When the father goes to Nevada to work with bomb testing the commander of the base (Powers Boothe) has his eyes on the sexpot wife.I don't follow film awards, but Jessica won an Oscar for her performance as the hysterical wife and she deserved it. For this reason many hail the first two acts of the film, and Tommy Lee as well. Unfortunately, her character comes across as unlikable and even scary. You start to feel sad for the daughters!Some people criticize Boothe as being too dastardly of a villain. Don't believe it. Do these critics really think there aren't any high-ranking military personnel with a Genghis Khan complex? Men who think they're above the rules and can get away with anything their arrogant butts' desire? Boothe's character comes across as a solid military leader who's tempted by a subordinate's sultry wife and then does everything he can to save himself. This type of behavior is older than David and Bathsheba.Some complain about how unbelievable the last act is. Two things: (1.) This is a movie and movies always amp up the dramatics. The filmmakers essentially have to do this because, well, it's a movie and they only have 2 hours to tell the story. (2.) Besides, the film's making a point about Lange's character and it's important to the story. ***SPOILER ALERT*** It shows that, as erratic and unlikable as she is in the first two acts, she redeems herself in the final act by literally risking everything for her husband. It's a powerful and necessary point. ***END SPOILER***This is also a good film about life on a military base, like ""The Great Santini"" with some similarities to ""Desert Bloom"", albeit not quite as good as either.The film was shot in Selma, Alabama, Florida and El Paso, Texas. It runs 101 minutes.GRADE: B",4,"A crazy sexpot wife, but... worthy",1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,2166,"['Shot', 'Fall/Spring', '1989-90', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'released', '1994', 'story', 'military', 'family', 'early', '60s', 'who', 'move', 'Alabama', 'base', 'wife', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'erratic', 'bipolar', 'behaves', 'loony', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'husband', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'unshakably', 'faithful', 'two', 'daughters', 'lament', 'mother', 'disorder', 'family', 'strong', 'nevertheless', 'When', 'father', 'Nevada', 'work', 'bomb', 'testing', 'commander', 'base', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'eyes', 'sexpot', 'wife.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'film', 'awards', 'Jessica', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'hysterical', 'wife', 'deserved', 'reason', 'many', 'hail', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'film', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'as', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'character', 'unlikable', 'even', 'scary', 'start', 'feel', 'sad', 'daughters', 'people', 'criticize', 'Boothe', 'being', 'too', 'dastardly', 'villain', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Do', 'critics', 'really', 'think', 'are', ""n't"", 'high-ranking', 'military', 'personnel', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'complex', 'Men', 'who', 'think', ""'re"", 'rules', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'arrogant', 'butts', 'desire', 'Boothe', 'character', 'across', 'solid', 'military', 'leader', 'who', 'tempted', 'subordinate', 'sultry', 'wife', 'then', 'everything', 'can', 'save', 'type', 'behavior', 'older', 'David', 'Bathsheba.Some', 'complain', 'how', 'unbelievable', 'last', 'act', 'Two', 'things', '1', 'movie', 'movies', 'always', 'amp', 'up', 'dramatics', 'filmmakers', 'essentially', 'have', 'do', 'because', 'well', 'movie', 'only', 'have', '2', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', '2', 'film', 'making', 'point', 'Lange', 'character', 'important', 'story', 'ALERT***', 'that', 'erratic', 'unlikable', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'final', 'act', 'literally', 'risking', 'everything', 'husband', 'powerful', 'necessary', 'point', '***END', 'SPOILER***This', 'also', 'good', 'film', 'life', 'military', 'base', 'Great', 'Santini', 'similarities', 'Desert', 'Bloom', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'either.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Selma', 'Alabama', 'Florida', 'El', 'Paso', 'Texas', '101', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
