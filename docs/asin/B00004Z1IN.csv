Me and my Friend Leon (I have to give him a mention as he made me watch this epic) stumbled onto this work of genius by accident and so far we have yet to see an unintentionally funnier horror film, the work is just plain inspired! You may think im exaggerating but please buy it and you'll understand. The story is basically centred around a killer clown summoned up by a ghetto child but to be honest you don't really need to know the story as it's a piece of crap, it's all about the acting and set pieces which are truly awful in a laugh out loud way , it's magic. And to top it all off the disc also comes with a ""making of"" which in itself is hilarious. The director really does believe that he is directing a classic of ""Night of the living dead"" proportions. And the actors all think that it's there big break into ""Hollywood"". Its truly the worst film ever made and for that reason alone it stands as a classic. The word Turkey was born for this. Awesome..

This time they chose a 21 year old script writer who knows the street lingo and is up to date on the horror genre.  The Killjoy character is a combination of Jim Carey and Tim Curry and the guy from Sgt. Kabukiman.  Of course he has all the best dialogue.  Beware the profanity is blunt, but isn't that what you expect in urban life. Not much in the way of extras.  There is a twelve minute documentary thrown in with the trailer, but no other promos.

There aren't a lot of horror films out there featuring an African-American cast, but there's one more than there should be.  It absolutely floored me to find out that this film actually inspired two sequels.  I can forgive one horrible movie, but three Killjoys really should be a crime.  Truly, there is not one positive thing I can say about this movie; heck, I can't even give thanks that the film is so short because, even at 72 minutes, it goes on and on much longer than it should have.  The acting is horrible, the dialogue is horrible, the film's herky-jerky pace is horrible, the special effects are embarrassingly horrible, and the story itself is utterly hopeless.Boy loves girl; boy gets beaten up and murdered by girl's gangsta boyfriend; ridiculous clown with a magical ice cream truck seeks revenge on everyone involved.  Apart from the absurd ending, that's pretty much the whole movie in a nutshell.  For some reason, it took our victim's black magic ritual a year to actually work, and Killjoy the killer crown isn't exactly interested in justice when he does show up.  It's a good thing there's a homeless man knowledgeable in the ways of this whole business that shows up with some advice on putting an end to the clownish carnage.As painful as it is watching this film's gangstas trying to sound like gangstas, it's Killjoy's dialogue that will have your ears bleeding.  It's one incredibly unfunny one-liner after another with this guy, but he's the only one laughing - maniacally - every single time he says anything.  The special effects, on the other hand, are laughable, including what has to be the worst CGI beheading I've ever seen.  I can only hope that someday in the distant future I will be able to block the bad memories of this awful film from my mind.

After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.Review - 2/5When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse.

560872,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00004Z1IN,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","Let me just start off by saying that this is not a pure horror movie. This is more along the lines of a comedy horror movie. C'mon, anytime there's a clown involved in a horror movie, you know there's bound to be comedy. Anyways, Killjoy is a ""horror"" movie that takes place in the 90s ghetto of an urban area and is about a social outcast high school kid named Michael, who is the target of a group of gangsters: Lorenzo, T-Bone, and Baby Boy. Michael has a crush on Lorenzo's girlfriend, Jada, and at the beginning of the film is seen trying to get close to her, but leads to the arrival of the gangsters who lay a beating out on Michael. Tired of consistently being attacked by the 3, Michael gets involved with Black Magic to try and summon a demon to possess his only friend, a Killjoy doll and help him teach the 3 thugs a lesson. However, before Michael can finish the process; he is abducted by the gang and brought into an abandoned area of the woods, Michael is accidentally shot and killed by Lorenzo when they were supposedly joking around with him.Skip to a year later as the remaining cast must come face to face with Killjoy, a demonic killer clown with an ice cream truck transporter. Acting in this movie was a little overplayed and the effects in this movie were so cheap and beyond low budget, it's almost as if a high school Mass Communications class made the film. Don't believe me? Watch the trailer and you'll see for yourself. Throughout the film we see an angel in the form of a homeless old man, warning Jada of Killjoy and how to defeat him. In the end, all I have to say is, skip on this movie and watch the others that follow. Acting is a bit better and the effects are much more acceptable and don't look like a 9th grader just began learning how to use effects. The only funny thing about this movie is maybe the clown's laugh. That's it. Other than that, you're not missing anything.

Full Moon does make some really great trashy movies (The Puppet Master and Subspecies series for example), but this one is just plain trash. In fact, I'm very angry that 90 minutes of my life was wasted on this crap. The plot of the The plot concerns a guy who loves a girl whose boyfriend is a hoodlum. In order to pay the guys back after getting beaten up, the guy invokes Killjoy, some kind of killer clown demon to come take care of his problem. Well, nothing happens, and then the hoodlum and some of his partners kill the guy, and one year later, Killjoy pops up to wreak havoc. I probabaly just made that sound a lot better than it actually is. The movie has no continuity. In the first scene, the guy attempts to ask out the girl, but is then beaten by the hoodlum and his partners. Cut straight to a scene of the guy sitting in a circle surrounding by candles holding a clown doll and &quot;calling on Killjoy&quot;. I couldn't figure out what was going on, like who or what is Killjoy? In addition, there's an ominous mystical man who looks entirely like a wino and gives no explanation of what Killjoy is and disappears in a flash of light (demonstrating some really bad SFX). This movie seems to get everything wrong. It takes its incredibably stupid plot seriously, the acting is terrible, the script is full of cliches and bad dialogue, not to mention the Killjoy character. After the movie wasted a good half-hour getting to him, any seriousness the movie is going to attempt goes down the drain when he opens his mouth. First of all, Killjoy laughs after everything he says...everything! And it gets really annoying when nothing he says is funny. If you're looking for a good horror movie, this is not it. If you're looking for a bad horror movie to make fun of, this still is not it, and if you're a full moon fan, notice that this an especially ripe turkey. In addition, there's a documentary included that is actually the only fun you might have with this movie. The seriousness of the actors and producers, who treat this movie as if it were CITIZEN KANE are laughable. Beware!
