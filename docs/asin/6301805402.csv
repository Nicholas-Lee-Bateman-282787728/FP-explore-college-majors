This was a made-for-TV movie, and all we had was a VHS tape lifted from HBO 25+ years ago.

Richard Thomas plays a very believable and likable character as the eager to please but definitely browbeaten shoemaker to the domineering daughter of the shopkeeper, played by Sharon Gless,  who decides to take matters and the business into her own very capable hands. Its a delightful story that will have you applauding her resourcefulness and the transformation of Thomas as a shy, naive shoemaker to one who will eventually command the respect from the entire family.",5,Better than the Original,1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,545,"['Liked', 'version', 'much', 'better', 'original', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'very', 'believable', 'likable', 'character', 'eager', 'please', 'definitely', 'browbeaten', 'shoemaker', 'domineering', 'daughter', 'shopkeeper', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'who', 'take', 'matters', 'business', 'own', 'very', 'capable', 'hands', 'delightful', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'applauding', 'resourcefulness', 'transformation', 'Thomas', 'shy', 'naive', 'shoemaker', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'command', 'respect', 'entire', 'family']",N/A
