822452,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00023BKO0,C. O. DeRiemer,"[14, 14]","This is an enormously satisying British television program involving political hypocrisy, personal corruption and revenge. It's a mixture of cynical humor and serious political observations. And it features great acting all around.Duncan Matlock (Trevor Eve) is an up-and-coming Tory politician who's specialities are family values and ambition. He's married to Flora Matlock (Juliet Stevenson), who loves him and who has supported his climb up the Tory ranks for years. She's the epitome of the perfect political wife...smart, wealthy, loyal, socially adept but with a human touch, great at looking entranced at her husband on stage while he gives his speeches about values and family. When it's discovered he's had an affair with a former prostitute (Minnie Driver), she is devestated, but he pleads for forgiveness saying it was only a passing weakness. The Tory damage-control team, headed by Sir Donald Frazier (Ian Bannen), after weighing things for a bit, decides to swing behind Duncan and convices Flora that her husband is a changed man. She agrees to stay with him.Then she learns Duncan's affairs go way back, that they are continuing, that he has a habit of using people, which includes her and the people who lead organizations trying to help battered women and familes, for his own ends. Flora sets out to seek her revenge...and does so with great subtlety. Duncan doesn't know what hit him until it's too late, and she gently forces Sir Donald and his inner-party big wigs to make some cynical choices. I'm not sure there's a male politician in the bunch who comes off very well -- they all seem to be self-satisfied, self-serving members of the same club. Flora beats them at their own game.Juliet Stevenson is a first-rate acrtess, and she does a superb job. She moves from devotion to hurt to forgiveness to a strong, smart woman setting up hidden revenge with immense believeabilty. Her short speech before a group of Tory wives who call themselves The Conservative Christian Wives Club (this is after she has discovered the truth about her husband but is playing the loyal wife) is a funny, ironic piece of subversion. Trevor Eve is just about as good as the charming, believable, ambitious, hypocritical politician on the make.""The Politican's Wife"" was shown in three installments and runs just over three hours. There's not a dull moment. The DVD transfer, on one disc, is very good. This is the unedited UK version.

822453,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B00023BKO0,D. Hartley,"[6, 6]","An outstanding and overlooked drama from 1995 that was originally presented as a three-part miniseries in the UK. Juliet Stevenson delivers a tour-de-force performance as Flora, the staunchly supportive wife of Duncan Matlock,an ambitious rising star in England's conservative Tory party. Scandal erupts when Duncan is caught with his pants down by the notorious British tabloid press. His fling with an ""escort"" girl (Minnie Driver) quickly becomes fertile ground for muckraking, as he happens to be the Minister of Family (oops).At first, Flora suffers in silence,desperately wanting to believe her husband's assurance that it was only a regrettable one night stand. She caves to pressure from Duncan's handlers (including her own father) to keep a brave face in public, ""for the sake of the party"". But when a conscience-stricken member of the Minister's inner circle slips Flora some irrefutable evidence proving that the ""fling"" was in fact a torrid year-long affair, her pain turns to bitterness and anger. Fueled by the deep sense of betrayal and growing awareness of Duncan's wanton abuse of his powers, she hatches a clever and methodical scheme to subvert his political capital right under his nose.The beauty of Paula Milne's script lies in the subtle execution of Flora's revenge. Avoiding the usual ""Hell hath no fury"" clich&eacute;s, Milne's protagonist (not unlike Livia in I, Claudius) finds her empowerment through an assimilated understanding of what makes the members of this particular boy's club tick; she is then able to orchestrate events in such a manner that they all end up falling on their own swords (keep your friends close, but your enemies closer).

822454,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B00023BKO0,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[10, 14]","I suppose it's too corny to say the truth can be stranger than fiction, but when THE POLITICIAN'S WIFE was first aired in 1995, the unfolding scandal concerning the American White House lay in the future making this film a bit prescient as it forcast events that could and do happen, almost daily in the US.  With few exceptions, sex scandals involving politicians rock Progressives not Conservatives. The wayward husband (Trevor Eve) in this tale is a Conservative member of Parliament(UK) with a loyal following of fellow conservatives played by actors who regularly appear in BBC/Masterpiece productions (i.e.the late Ian Banning).I suppose my favorite Juiet Stevenson role must be the heart-broken lover in TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY, but she has appeared in countless other roles (which will make her face very familiar to fellow Anglophiles) including officious characters in various dramatizations of 19th century novels including a Jane Austin novel or two. Stevenson is good at looking and acting like a skin-flint up-tight member of the upper crust comes as naturally to her as it does to Dame Maggie Smith. In this film she demonstrates once again she is also great at playing the heart-broken wife of one who has gone off the rails.The sex scenes between Stevenson and Eve are quite risque for a family-values oriented household, but those who are devoted to Masterpiece Theater know that PBS has been airing adult fare for a long time (reality tv for the educated class). Viewers who waited for Eve to make a move on Susannah Harkins in HEAT OF THE SUN may be disappointed that he waited until this film. The bedroom scenes between Eve and Stevenson are oppressive as they are between a man who is trying to cover his tracks, and a wife who has been ""passed over"".  Just how does one get over the effect of hearing audio-recordings of a spouse's indiscretion- especially as it was not a one-night-stand, but a long term affair?  At first it seems Ms Matlock is going to rise above it all, but in the end, she succumbs to the urge for revenge. The result did not leave me feeling ""lifted"" but rather sad that folks spend so much time getting even, especially when death is all around.

Paula Milne has written the script to a three-part miniseries seen not too long ago on Masterpiece Theatre called ""The Politician's Wife."" The Minister for Family (of all people) is caught in a love nest scandal. And like a certain President's wife of recent memory, his spouse is expected by The Party to stand behind him. Well, she does-and in the most original way possible. As all the Old Boys rally behind this despicable lowlife, the wife uses that very system of disinformation to get back a bit of her own. Just how she does it and with what results I refuse to say, because I want you to savor this jaundiced view of inner-party workings and how they destroy whatever traces of humanity those concerned might have had once.Well, this show is now yours for the viewing on an Acorn Media DVD (AMP 7117), and I suggest you grab it. It is due to appear on July 6, 2004; but I wanted to give you lots of warning.The disgusting conservative minister is played to perfection by Trevor Eve, while the equally evil (but just possibly unwitting bait in the trap) femme fatale is made very believable by Minnie Driver. But the show belongs to Juliet Stevenson as the wife who does what is considered (by men, of course) to be her duty in the most beautiful Iago-like way. My favorite part is the speech she gives to the wives of other conservative politicians, in which she thanks them sincerely for showing her that personal morality and feelings and family and true devotion must all be put aside for the sake of The Party. This Swiftian moment is nearly matched later when she tells someone about how her husband is such an accomplished liar that he has started to believe his own lies-as long as he is still speaking them. Do governments ever really change?In fact, the only sympathetic characters other than the wife (and that is a matter of opinion) are the two children. All the other male characters are smiling, foul Party-beings to whom ""conservative"" means nothing more than conserving their power and ""truth"" means nothing more than the most effective lie that will serve their turn.The three episodes have a total running time of 187 minutes and every minute is riveting. True to what television executives think the public wants, we get our usual quota of nipple shots (why do these actresses put up with this?) and the F-count is under 10. (Remember when they had to get special permission to say Damn at the end of ""Gone With the Wind""?)There are some film-biogs at the end and an interesting essay by the author that you will have to read off the screen.

822458,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00023BKO0,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[8, 9]","`The Politician's Wife' is a fascinating drama, a revenge story of the first order, and a good rendition of post-Thatcher politics shortly before the fall of the Conservative Party, in part due to charges of corruption from being so long in office.  This is a Channel Four production, also shown on the PBS series (heavily edited) `Masterpiece Theatre' in the United States.This is a drama as a triptych.  The first part is discovery, the second part failed reconciliation and aftermath, with the third part revenge.  Flora Matlock is a perfect politician's wife - dutiful, full of charm and good works, reasonably stylish without being ostentatious, and definitely one not to outshine her rising-star ministerial husband.  Coming from a family with a political background (her father is himself an almost-has-been in the Party, hoping to hitch himself to the rising Duncan Matlock), she was the `right sort' who could be counted on to act in such a way as was `meet and right so to do'.  But Duncan has a secret that has just been revealed.Flora discovers her husband's affair first from the media onslaught that occurs as a result of the press getting hold of the story.  Duncan Matlock enlists the aid of the various party members, including Flora's own father, to pressure her to forgive him, not just for the sake of their marriage, but for the sake of the party; they hope that her party-political upbringing will help her to `see reason' in this process.However, there is one party functionary who does not like what is going on (Mark Hollister, a middle-weight player in the party, who perhaps sees the fall of Duncan Matlock as his opportunity to rise in the party).  Duncan Matlock had described his affair with Jennifer Caird in very generic, disarming terms to Flora.  Hollister provides very graphic tape recordings of phone sex and other very prurient details that show Flora just how much Duncan was concealing.  Flora decides to take on her husband, her husband's mistress Jennifer (who seems to thrive on the continuing attention both of Duncan and the media), and the whole party apparatus to get justice, a kind of justice she decides for herself.The party functionaries are Machiavellian, but it turns out they are rank amateurs compared to Hollister (in the beginning) and what Flora Matlock becomes.  She uses her history and their constant underestimation of her to good advantage, and soon has the upper hand in all dealings.  Her revenge is indeed sweet in the end.Acting and DirectingJuliet Stevenson does a remarkable acting job, going from the somewhat mousy to dramatically tough Flora Duncan in the space of three episodes.  To play the two different characters would be acting ability enough; to carry forward both characters as a believable combination of both into one is great.  Trevor Eve plays a great villain as Duncan Matlock, condescending and ambitious, deceitful and emotionally usurious.  Indeed, one might wonder at the mismatch between Flora and Duncan given their different characters, save for one conversation between Flora and her father, where he claims that she had to know what he was like when she picked him for a husband, and she responds that she didn't pick him, he picked her.  Another stand-out performance is by Minnie Driver, in her pre-Hollywood days, as Jennifer Caird, the outspoken mistress of Duncan Matlock.  Anton Lesser also does a good job as Mark Hollister, playing the one who seems to care both what happens to Flora as well as to his own career.This is definitely one of Graham Theakston's best - he has directed episodes in a lot of dramatic series (Cadfael, A Touch of Frost, Taggart, Dempsey & Makepeace) as well as a few other stand-alone projects (Sherlock, The Mill on the Floss).  The pacing is good throughout, and the overall tone of the production is a good one, befitting its political theme.The production won the BAFTA TV award, the International Emmy for drama, the Peabody Award, and the Writer's Guild of Great Britain award for dramatic writing, all in 1995 or 1996.Spoiler Alert  *  *  *  Spoiler Alert  *  *  *  Spoiler AlertRead no further if you don't want to know the nature and outcome of Flora's revenge.My favourite scene has to be at the conclusion, while Duncan is sitting in the airport lobby seats, waiting for a flight to take him to a do-nothing graveyard post in the European Parliament  (I recall the words of Jim Hacker, from `Yes, Minister', who described taking a European Parliament job as a dead-end for a political career - `You're reduced to having to start your own party if you ever want to make it back,' he said).  On the television in the airport lobby is a broadcast of the election results for the parliamentary seat vacated by Duncan, and there is the victor, the radiant Flora Matlock, who has beaten her husband and the whole of the party machine at their own game.  Indeed, she was by that point another Iron Lady in the making.It is not unusual in politics for a widow to take the place of a politician who dies in office.  This was true even before women began to regularly elected in their own right - it also speaks to the skill and lack of appreciation that politician's wives tend to get in general.

It seems that the 21st century is loaded with American infidelity among men in high political positions. This story, written and produced in 1995, seems more appropriate now than in that century. Certainly at least, there is more of the misbehavior exposed. If you are in favor of top politicians cheating on their wives, then you might not like this DVD.Be warned, it is mature material, includes nudity, and bedroom scenes.There are NO subtitles or CC. Minimal bonus material.Three one-hour episodes make this a double-feature-length tale and extreme value used or new. My wife and I, after viewing the first time, looked at each other, and at the same time said, ""5 stars.""Episode 1: Stand by Him_._Flora Matlock (Juliet Stevenson) is the Politician's Wife, happy, subservient. But don't cross her as politician hubby, (Trevor Eve) did. She bites back. Duncan Matlock should have recognized this prior to his 'hanky-panky' ways. This film's politician's affairs take place on British soil, but it parallels past scandals with many Washington politicians--even Presidents. Excellent acting by this lead pair, one making you love her, and cheer. The other offering disgust at his inconsiderate attitude toward his wife. You'll want him to get taken down.Episode 2 Echo Chamber_._Flora plays tapes of erotic conversations between her cheating hubby and liaison tart, Jennifer Caird (Minnie Driver). She was also supplied photos. The conversations and Stevenson nudity is unrated, but not for kids. Flora's disgust with the affair gets her thinking revenge. 3 cheers for Flora.Episode 3 Body Politics_._It's survival of the fittest. after a political bloody battle. A woman's-day-out finale. I didn't see the ending coming. Well done. You see Flora bloom within her own person in this film.This story has won many awards including an International Emmy and BAFTA.PBS great!",5,More relative now than when first produced,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,1945,"['story', 'unfaithful', 'political', 'men', 'how', 'could', 'turn', '21st', 'century', 'loaded', 'American', 'infidelity', 'men', 'high', 'political', 'positions', 'story', 'written', 'produced', '1995', 'more', 'appropriate', 'now', 'century', 'Certainly', 'least', 'more', 'misbehavior', 'exposed', 'are', 'favor', 'top', 'politicians', 'cheating', 'wives', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'DVD.Be', 'warned', 'mature', 'material', 'nudity', 'bedroom', 'are', 'NO', 'subtitles', 'CC', 'Minimal', 'bonus', 'material.Three', 'one-hour', 'episodes', 'make', 'double-feature-length', 'tale', 'extreme', 'value', 'used', 'new', 'wife', 'viewing', 'first', 'time', 'looked', 'other', 'same', 'time', 'said', '5', 'stars', 'Episode', '1', 'Stand', 'Him_._Flora', 'Matlock', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Politician', 'Wife', 'happy', 'subservient', 'do', ""n't"", 'cross', 'politician', 'hubby', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'did', 'back', 'Duncan', 'Matlock', 'should', 'have', 'recognized', 'prior', ""'hanky-panky"", 'ways', 'film', 'politician', 'affairs', 'take', 'place', 'British', 'soil', 'past', 'scandals', 'many', 'Washington', 'politicians', 'even', 'Presidents', 'Excellent', 'acting', 'lead', 'pair', 'one', 'making', 'love', 'cheer', 'other', 'offering', 'disgust', 'inconsiderate', 'attitude', 'wife', ""'ll"", 'want', 'get', 'taken', 'down.Episode', '2', 'Echo', 'Chamber_._Flora', 'tapes', 'erotic', 'conversations', 'cheating', 'hubby', 'liaison', 'tart', 'Jennifer', 'Caird', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'was', 'also', 'supplied', 'photos', 'conversations', 'Stevenson', 'nudity', 'unrated', 'not', 'kids', 'Flora', 'disgust', 'affair', 'thinking', 'revenge', '3', 'cheers', 'Flora.Episode', '3', 'Body', 'Politics_._It', 'survival', 'fittest', 'political', 'bloody', 'battle', ""woman's-day-out"", 'finale', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'Well', 'done', 'see', 'Flora', 'bloom', 'own', 'person', 'film.This', 'story', 'won', 'many', 'awards', 'including', 'International', 'Emmy', 'BAFTA.PBS', 'great']",N/A

The writing and characterization is superb and casting was perfect. Before it was over, I saw the actors playing out a drama that was so realistic and true to life. As the levels of betrayal unfold we learn so many details that might have destroyed a lesser lady but Flora pulls off her answer to Duncan's deception by plotting the perfect revenge. After the details of Duncan's &#34;other life&#34; become known to Flora, I could envision her thoughts and reactions to each lie as the lies accumulated. The way she executes her plan is brilliant! You could almost see the wheels in her mind turning as knowledge comes to her piece by piece. Juliet Stephenson's portrayal of Flora is outstanding. Duncan was played to perfection by Trevor Eve as he underestimates his wife and leads his double life.

Yes, Juliet Stevenson is a fine actress, capable of much by doing very little. But no one else in this tepid tale of betrayal and revenge comes close. And the plot is very hard to believe. Very. I am no politician, but movies about things I know something about (schools, offices, restaurants) are all very unconvincing. I suspect this would cause real politicians to laugh as well. It just doesn't ring true.The changes in her husband's behavior seem remarkable. He was a caring, compassionate man before she finds out, then he is a rat, not even ""for the children."" He was loving and kind to her, then becomes eager for rough play in bed. He was a skilled orator and on the fast track to success, then his wife out maneuvers him.And the pious conclusion made me wretch. No, no, this isn't about revenge. Oh no, nothing so low as that. He needed to be stopped. But she didn't know he needed to be ""stopped"" before she found out about his cheating. But she never felt he needed to be stopped before that. Sorry. She takes him down.

822464,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00023BKO0,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","How many times have news headlines featured sex scandals involving high level politicians? Exactly. Too many to count. That makes THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE timely, important and relevant.While not entirely successful due to an at times obvious anti-Conservative bias, this superb production takes a familiar scenario and turns it on its ear. By focusing on the wronged wife&#8217;s perspective, writer Paula Milne injects new life into what could have been a heavy-handed tirade against the abuses of power.Walking a fine line between condemning blatant hypocrisy and asserting the producers&#8217; apparent political views, THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE works best when it takes you inside the mind and swirling emotions of Juliet Stevenson&#8217;s Flora. Her emotional breakdown is both heart-breaking and fascinating and her subsequent course of action (read Revenge) is alternately satisfying, disastrous and unexpectedly life-changing. Flora&#8217;s thoroughly rotten adulterer husband is made palatable simply by being played by Trevor Eve, a likeable actor who is unafraid to take tremendous risks with this role. One wonders how often he was recognized in public after the initial broadcast and told off, in no uncertain terms, by some formerly adoring fan (it happens).Probably the most remarkable aspect of THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE is how it analyzes the whole concept of Betrayal. There are other themes as well, including hypocrisy, honour, morality, etc. But the anatomy of betrayal has rarely been better portrayed. Eve&#8217;s Duncan is a man so wholly convinced of his own destiny that his sense of entitlement is astounding. He relies so completely on his wife (she even cuts his toenails for him when he&#8217;s in the bath) and yet his reprehensible act of betrayal is somehow justified in his own mind.The series then asks the question &#8220;when is revenge justified?&#8221; And at what cost? The transformative power of betrayal is examined with a surgeon&#8217;s precision, using a literary scalpel to peel away the layers of humanity that are sacrificed when individuals become desensitized to commitment, loyalty and dedication, (whether to another individual or to a cause, i.e. &#8220;the Party&#8221;).The outcome of THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE may shock as well as (or instead of) satisfy. Along the way there is a positively brilliant cliffhanger at the end of episode two which illustrates why Duncan is such a successful politician. You won&#8217;t see it coming. Nor are you likely to guess the conclusion to this superior drama.As mentioned, the only reservation this reviewer has is the implication that hypocrisy and corruption are limited to the political party representing conservative values. There exists in the arts world a proclivity for liberalism that is often very much at odds with &#8220;traditional values&#8217;. When this spills over into obvious bias it contradicts the supposed fair way of thinking many artists proclaim. Were this aspect trimmed from THE POLITICIAN&#8217;S WIFE the film would be in a much better place to express moral outrage. Hypocrisy and betrayal are unfortunate traits of human nature, encouraged by power and privilege. They are not specific to any political idealogy or professed moral world view. The news headlines are proof of that.",4,Powerful.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,3318,"['How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'news', 'headlines', 'featured', 'sex', 'scandals', 'involving', 'high', 'level', 'politicians', 'Exactly', 'Too', 'many', 'count', 'THE', 'POLITICIAN', '8217', 'S', 'WIFE', 'timely', 'important', 'relevant.While', 'not', 'entirely', 'successful', 'due', 'times', 'obvious', 'anti-Conservative', 'bias', 'superb', 'production', 'familiar', 'scenario', 'ear', 'focusing', 'wronged', 'wife', '8217', 'perspective', 'writer', 'Paula', 'Milne', 'new', 'life', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'heavy-handed', 'tirade', 'abuses', 'power.Walking', 'fine', 'line', 'condemning', 'blatant', 'hypocrisy', 'asserting', 'producers', '8217', 'apparent', 'political', 'views', 'THE', 'POLITICIAN', '8217', 'S', 'WIFE', 'best', 'when', 'mind', 'swirling', 'emotions', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', '8217', 'Flora', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'heart-breaking', 'fascinating', 'subsequent', 'course', 'action', 'read', 'Revenge', 'alternately', 'satisfying', 'disastrous', 'unexpectedly', 'life-changing', 'Flora', '8217', 'thoroughly', 'rotten', 'adulterer', 'husband', 'made', 'palatable', 'simply', 'being', 'played', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'likeable', 'actor', 'who', 'unafraid', 'take', 'tremendous', 'risks', 'role', 'One', 'how', 'often', 'was', 'recognized', 'public', 'initial', 'broadcast', 'told', 'off', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'formerly', 'adoring', 'fan', '.Probably', 'most', 'remarkable', 'aspect', 'THE', 'POLITICIAN', '8217', 'S', 'WIFE', 'how', 'whole', 'concept', 'Betrayal', 'are', 'other', 'themes', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'hypocrisy', 'honour', 'morality', 'etc', 'anatomy', 'betrayal', 'rarely', 'been', 'better', 'portrayed', 'Eve', '8217', 's', 'Duncan', 'man', 'so', 'wholly', 'convinced', 'own', 'destiny', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'astounding', 'so', 'completely', 'wife', 'even', 'toenails', 'when', '8217', 's', 'bath', 'yet', 'reprehensible', 'act', 'betrayal', 'somehow', 'justified', 'own', 'mind.The', 'series', 'then', 'question', '8220', 'when', 'revenge', 'justified', '8221', 'what', 'cost', 'transformative', 'power', 'betrayal', 'examined', 'surgeon', '8217', 'precision', 'using', 'literary', 'scalpel', 'peel', 'away', 'layers', 'humanity', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'when', 'individuals', 'become', 'desensitized', 'commitment', 'loyalty', 'dedication', 'individual', 'cause', 'i.e', '8220', 'Party', '8221', '.The', 'outcome', 'THE', 'POLITICIAN', '8217', 'S', 'WIFE', 'may', 'shock', 'as', 'well', 'instead', 'satisfy', 'way', 'positively', 'brilliant', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'episode', 'two', 'why', 'Duncan', 'such', 'successful', 'politician', 'won', '8217', 'see', 'coming', 'are', 'likely', 'guess', 'conclusion', 'superior', 'drama.As', 'mentioned', 'only', 'reservation', 'reviewer', 'implication', 'hypocrisy', 'corruption', 'are', 'limited', 'political', 'party', 'representing', 'conservative', 'values', 'arts', 'world', 'proclivity', 'liberalism', 'often', 'very', 'much', 'odds', '8220', 'traditional', 'values', '8217', 'When', 'over', 'obvious', 'bias', 'supposed', 'fair', 'way', 'thinking', 'many', 'artists', 'proclaim', 'Were', 'aspect', 'trimmed', 'THE', 'POLITICIAN', '8217', 'S', 'WIFE', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'place', 'express', 'moral', 'outrage', 'Hypocrisy', 'betrayal', 'are', 'unfortunate', 'traits', 'human', 'nature', 'encouraged', 'power', 'privilege', 'are', 'not', 'specific', 'political', 'idealogy', 'professed', 'moral', 'world', 'view', 'news', 'headlines', 'are', 'proof']",N/A
822465,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00023BKO0,Joseph Haschka,"[7, 8]","THE POLITICIAN'S WIFE is further evidence that even talented men are ruled by gonadal impulses and should leave the heavy mental lifting to the ladies.Flora (Juliet Stevenson) is married to a junior Cabinet minister in Her Majesty's Government, Duncan Matlock (Trevor Eve). Duncan gets caught up in a scandal, which, because he's a Tory in a Conservative administration, is sexual in nature - he's linked to an escort babe (Minnie Driver). Though Duncan declares to Flora that it was a one-off affair, it becomes apparent to the latter and the audience during the first installment of this three-episode telly miniseries that the trysts continue. Indeed, Flora has her nose rubbed in it when she comes into possession of tapes of Duncan and his tart having phone sex. It's devastating stuff. So, while pretending to be the loyal wife standing at her husband's side during damage control efforts by the local Conservative organization, and while Duncan himself strives to get a piece of controversial legislation through Parliament, Flora stage-manages his political downfall with the unwitting aid of a powerful Tory Mr. Fixit, smoothly played by Ian Bannen (the schemer of WAKING NED DEVINE), since deceased.The performances by all actors involved are top drawer. Indeed, Duncan is the male pig you love to hate, and he's a politician besides. Eeeuw! But THE POLITICIAN'S WIFE is a one-woman show, and Juliet Stevenson is the one you pay to watch as her Flora persona picks herself off the floor - kicked while down - and gives hubby his just desserts.  There are times when, as Flora gazes at her spouse as if he's an interesting lab specimen, you can almost hear the wheels in her head turning, turning, turning, and you know the man is doomed. In a final scene, it appears that even Duncan admires his wife's Machiavellian talent.My only criticism - a trivial one - is that Duncan's Whitehall department, the Ministry for the Family (or some such), didn't project the grandiosity that warranted the attention provided by a juicy sex scandal. I mean, if the U.S. Secretary of HUD was caught flagrante delicto with a bimbo, who would care?THE POLITICIAN'S WIFE is perfect small-screen entertainment for those nights when the spouse is off at ... work?",5,The missus could've given Machiavelli lessons,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,2253,"['POLITICIAN', 'WIFE', 'further', 'evidence', 'even', 'talented', 'men', 'are', 'ruled', 'gonadal', 'impulses', 'should', 'leave', 'heavy', 'mental', 'lifting', 'ladies.Flora', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'married', 'junior', 'Cabinet', 'minister', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Government', 'Duncan', 'Matlock', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'Duncan', 'caught', 'up', 'scandal', 'Tory', 'Conservative', 'administration', 'sexual', 'nature', 'linked', 'escort', 'babe', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Duncan', 'declares', 'Flora', 'was', 'one-off', 'affair', 'apparent', 'latter', 'audience', 'first', 'installment', 'three-episode', 'telly', 'miniseries', 'trysts', 'continue', 'Indeed', 'Flora', 'nose', 'rubbed', 'when', 'possession', 'tapes', 'Duncan', 'tart', 'having', 'phone', 'sex', 'devastating', 'stuff', 'So', 'pretending', 'be', 'loyal', 'wife', 'standing', 'husband', 'side', 'damage', 'control', 'efforts', 'local', 'Conservative', 'organization', 'Duncan', 'get', 'piece', 'controversial', 'legislation', 'Parliament', 'Flora', 'political', 'downfall', 'unwitting', 'aid', 'powerful', 'Tory', 'Mr.', 'Fixit', 'smoothly', 'played', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'schemer', 'WAKING', 'NED', 'DEVINE', 'deceased.The', 'performances', 'actors', 'involved', 'are', 'top', 'drawer', 'Indeed', 'Duncan', 'male', 'pig', 'love', 'hate', 'politician', 'Eeeuw', 'THE', 'POLITICIAN', 'WIFE', 'one-woman', 'show', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'one', 'pay', 'watch', 'Flora', 'persona', 'picks', 'off', 'floor', 'kicked', 'down', 'hubby', 'just', 'desserts', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Flora', 'spouse', 'interesting', 'lab', 'specimen', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'wheels', 'head', 'turning', 'turning', 'turning', 'know', 'man', 'doomed', 'final', 'scene', 'even', 'Duncan', 'wife', 'Machiavellian', 'talent.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'trivial', 'one', 'Duncan', 'Whitehall', 'department', 'Ministry', 'Family', 'such', 'did', ""n't"", 'project', 'grandiosity', 'warranted', 'attention', 'provided', 'juicy', 'sex', 'scandal', 'mean', 'U.S.', 'Secretary', 'HUD', 'was', 'caught', 'flagrante', 'delicto', 'bimbo', 'who', 'would', 'care', 'POLITICIAN', 'WIFE', 'perfect', 'small-screen', 'entertainment', 'nights', 'when', 'spouse', 'off', 'work']",N/A
822466,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B00023BKO0,Kendra,"[5, 6]","We watched the entire three part (though only 187 minutes, I think) movie last night and woke up to the newest political scandal with Eliot Spitzer. How timely!This is a very good film about Flora, married to the Minister of Family whom espouses family values.  Sure enough, the movie starts with Duncan, her husband, coming home with his entourage and having to let his wife know about his one-night stand with another woman, since the press has found out and they are about to be hounded.Flora is absolutely broken-hearted. And, to make matters worse, nobody seems to show true sympathy to her for her heartbreak-- instead, everybody is concerned about Duncan keeping his position and about the ""Party"" (suffice it to say this has a definite liberal bias, but it's really not too bad).Her father is even a creep. Flora comes down in the middle of the night and sees her father (one of the ""party's"" cronies) and when he begins to let her know how upset he is about Duncan's infidelity, Flora assumes she will be shown some concern. However, the dad is only concerned about himself and his upset is due to his fear that Duncan will go down and that his own future will be ruined.  Despicable characters-- all of them!Anyways, soon Flora receives an anonymous tape with very explicit recordings of some phone sex her husband took part in with the woman he was having an affair with. She soon recognizes that this was no ""one-time"" fling, but a serious affair that took place over the better part of a year and was very very serious. She begins to really despise her husband, while at the same time hanging on to the bit of love she once had for him.  This part of the movie is interesting. It's obvious (to us) that she begins to really hate him-- hate his character and lack thereof.  His flaws are completely noticeable-- maybe for the first time to Flora. He lies. He hates gays. He hates the needy. He says what he needs to say for political expediency, and then whispers to Flora how he will get away with breaking the promises he just made a moment before. He's definitely unlikeable.However, rather than this being a ""Let's bash the Conservatives"" movie, one of Duncan's staff begins to help Flora plan Duncan's revenge.  And, it soon turns out that more of the ""Party"" start to see the error of Duncan's ways, as well. So, there are definitely a few ""honorable"" people here, except, really, who is really honorable when the methods are so despicable, even if those methods are the absolute only way to achieve the necessary goals?So, this becomes a film about morality, too. And, it is confusing, because we've grown to empathize with Flora but even she is capable of deceit.  But, her methods are definitely underhanded even though her heart (for everyone but Duncan) is in the right place.The acting is absolutely superb. Juliet Stevenson is extremely talented and I'm glad to see her in a lead role.  Minnie Driver plays the mistress with a perfect British accent.  Everyone else was good and the story moved along well, although had it gone a bit faster, I wouldn't have been disappointed.Part of what is interesting here is the perceived necessity for the politicians' wives to stand by their men after their husbands' infidelities are exposed. We saw it with Hillary Clinton, we've seen it with Jim McGreevey and his wife, we've seen it with Larry Craig and his wife, and now we're seeing it with Elliot Spitzer and his sad-looking wife.  These poor women (except for Hillary, I guess, who has her own reasons I suppose for staying)!  They are paraded out in public to stand by their men and show support and smile and hold hands, etc., even while the pain is probably still profuse.  Personally, I think the women would gain so much more respect by leaving. And, with Hillary, specifically (since she herself is in the public eye), I think her likeability would have gone way up had she left her chronically unfaithful husband behind.",4,Very timely story!,1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,3949,"['watched', 'entire', 'three', 'part', 'only', '187', 'minutes', 'think', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'woke', 'up', 'newest', 'political', 'scandal', 'Eliot', 'Spitzer', 'How', 'timely', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Flora', 'married', 'Minister', 'Family', 'whom', 'family', 'values', 'Sure', 'enough', 'movie', 'Duncan', 'husband', 'coming', 'home', 'entourage', 'having', 'let', 'wife', 'know', 'one-night', 'stand', 'woman', 'press', 'found', 'out', 'are', 'be', 'hounded.Flora', 'absolutely', 'broken-hearted', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'nobody', 'show', 'true', 'sympathy', 'heartbreak', 'instead', 'everybody', 'concerned', 'Duncan', 'keeping', 'position', 'Party', 'suffice', 'say', 'definite', 'liberal', 'bias', 'really', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'father', 'even', 'creep', 'Flora', 'down', 'middle', 'night', 'father', 'one', 'party', 'cronies', 'when', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'upset', 'Duncan', 'infidelity', 'Flora', 'will', 'be', 'shown', 'concern', 'However', 'dad', 'only', 'concerned', 'upset', 'due', 'fear', 'Duncan', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'own', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'ruined', 'Despicable', 'characters', 'Anyways', 'soon', 'Flora', 'anonymous', 'tape', 'very', 'explicit', 'recordings', 'phone', 'sex', 'husband', 'took', 'part', 'woman', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'soon', 'was', 'one-time', 'fling', 'serious', 'affair', 'took', 'place', 'better', 'part', 'year', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'serious', 'really', 'despise', 'husband', 'same', 'time', 'hanging', 'bit', 'love', 'once', 'had', 'part', 'movie', 'interesting', 'obvious', 'really', 'hate', 'hate', 'character', 'lack', 'thereof', 'flaws', 'are', 'completely', 'noticeable', 'maybe', 'first', 'time', 'Flora', 'gays', 'needy', 'what', 'say', 'political', 'expediency', 'then', 'whispers', 'Flora', 'how', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'breaking', 'promises', 'just', 'made', 'moment', 'before', 'definitely', 'unlikeable.However', 'rather', 'being', 'Let', 'bash', 'Conservatives', 'movie', 'one', 'Duncan', 'staff', 'help', 'Flora', 'plan', 'Duncan', 'revenge', 'soon', 'out', 'more', 'Party', 'start', 'see', 'error', 'Duncan', 'ways', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'are', 'definitely', 'few', 'honorable', 'people', 'here', 'really', 'who', 'really', 'honorable', 'when', 'methods', 'are', 'so', 'despicable', 'even', 'methods', 'are', 'absolute', 'only', 'way', 'achieve', 'necessary', 'goals', 'So', 'film', 'morality', 'too', 'confusing', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'empathize', 'Flora', 'even', 'capable', 'deceit', 'methods', 'are', 'definitely', 'underhanded', 'even', 'heart', 'everyone', 'Duncan', 'right', 'place.The', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'extremely', 'talented', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'lead', 'role', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'mistress', 'perfect', 'British', 'accent', 'Everyone', 'else', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'moved', 'along', 'well', 'had', 'gone', 'bit', 'faster', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'disappointed.Part', 'what', 'interesting', 'here', 'perceived', 'necessity', 'politicians', 'wives', 'stand', 'men', 'husbands', 'infidelities', 'are', 'exposed', 'saw', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jim', 'McGreevey', 'wife', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Larry', 'Craig', 'wife', 'now', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'Elliot', 'Spitzer', 'sad-looking', 'wife', 'poor', 'women', 'Hillary', 'guess', 'who', 'own', 'reasons', 'suppose', 'staying', 'are', 'paraded', 'out', 'public', 'stand', 'men', 'show', 'support', 'smile', 'hold', 'hands', 'etc.', 'even', 'pain', 'probably', 'still', 'profuse', 'Personally', 'think', 'women', 'would', 'gain', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'respect', 'leaving', 'Hillary', 'specifically', 'public', 'eye', 'think', 'likeability', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'up', 'had', 'left', 'chronically', 'unfaithful', 'husband']",N/A

This is a British television production of a Parliamentary sex scandal, something neither the British nor us are particulary strangers to. Actually, I felt that there was more than a little similarity between ""The Politician's Wife"" and recent governmental faux pas in America.Trevor Eve plays the poorly disguised rutting sexist pig, Duncan Matlock, and the lovely Minnie Driver plays a rather slow tart who actually thinks Duncan will leave his wife Flora to be with her. Of course there's the haunting consideration that she's a plant, a very attractive plant, and she seduces Duncan to fracture the Conservative Party. I vote for the former; Duncan's an idiot.And surrounded by idiots. The gang of men who are his aides are so sexist, conniving and moronic that whatever happens to them the viewer feels was and is just deserved.The British miniseries is stolen by Juliet Stevenson who plays Flora to the hilt, attractive, innocent, well spoken, suffering all the while plotting a palace coup.It is Brit telly so you get occasional nudity and a peppering of profane discussion amongst ""the men"" if you can call them that, but all in all good stuff.

This playing time is needed to allow for the intricate plotting of this complex drama.  In the first part Flora Matlock, wife of Tory minister and rising star Duncan Matlock, learns that her husband has been unfaithful to her.  This infidelity is ironic given that Duncan represents the family in the conservative English government.  At first Flora is surprised and angry.  We watch as she packs her bags to leave her husband.  Before she finishes her packing she gets pressure from all sides to support her husband.  She gives in to the manipulations of the men who want to keep Duncan in power. A little later on Flora learns from Duncan's assistant that the affair with an escort girl, Jennifer Cairn, lasted for a year or so.  She is given pictures and an audio tape documenting Duncan's infidelity.In part two Flora, an exceptionally bright and capable woman, plots Duncan's downfall.  Whenever she begins to question her motives, she listens to the audio tape to steel her in her resolve.  Flora is as clever as Iago in Othello.  We marvel at her political astuteness as she makes her plans and lays her traps for her husband, who deserves everything she does to him. In part three we hold our breath as she springs the trap and sets in motion a string of events that should keep all viewers watching closely to see what will happen next.The Politican's Wife represents the best of television drama.  The acting is first-rate by all participants, particularly Juliet Stepenson as Flora, Trevor Eve as Duncan, Ian Bannen, unfortunately now dead, as Sir Donald Frazier, confidant to Flora, and Minnie Driver as the escort girl.  A large cast supports these principals superbly.The story moves quickly and inexorably to the finale.  The only mild violence in the plot happens in the bedroom as we watch Flora begin to take control over her wayward husband by playing to his many sexual weaknesses.  Duncan is a manipulative villain and Flora is every bit his equal when it comes to scheming.  Flora can lie and cheat with the best of the men who surround her.Is lying ahd cheating what it takes to succeed in government?  The Politician's Wife suggests that honesty is for losers and those on the fast track to political power need to learn to manipulate the system to their advantage if they are going to have any chance at success.
