No, it's not bundled in an exact replica of the Conner's couch nor does it come with a replica of their afghan, but for this price it cannot be beat!  It's also got a bunch of extras like the original discs had.  I wish more series would have this budget-minded option available.  My Six Feet Under set is beautiful and comes with a headstone on top.  It doesn't make the show any better that I paid almost $200 for it.  I paid around $30 for 9 seasons of Roseanne and I am fine with it.  What I do is take the discs out season byt season.  So i have the three discs for season 5 out now and will open up the box and take the 3 for 6 out next.  Works fine for me.

More of us recognized pourselkbves in the Conners tha n the Braddys. Roseanne Barr began as a poor actress but surrounded herself by the finest actors out therre(Goodman,Metcalf) and she pushed the boundaires of television. She spoke to her kids the way people DO speak to their kids, she was over weight and her kids striggled with the same problems that OUR kids struggled with. The theme song is irritating and sadly it repeats and repeats when the disc finishes but at least every disc has a &#34;Play all unction.&#34;I supopoie this show was helpful for women';s rights but only up to a point. It does nothing to elevate women by degrating men and when a character such as Dan Conner (the best father and husband in the world) is continuously degraded it grows weary and not just as a male fewer; many women with whom I spoke were much more harsh than I. The &#34;loser men&#34; jokes get to be too much but the show has a place in history. It's almost as important as Mary Tyler Moore, but Moore did what she did with class and subtly and Roseanne beat us over the head with it and prided herself for the lack o class.There are outstandingly funny situations and one thing that can be said is that Roseanne was responsible for discovering a LOT of new talent: Acgtors such as Johnny Galecki, Sarah Chalke,  George Clooney Joseph Gordon Leavit, Christian Slater and writers such as Chuck Lorre and Joss Wheedon got their start here. J. &#34;Snuuffy Walden&#34; wrote the music and later become the composer for every Aaron Sorkin show on network television including the award wining &#34;west Wing.&#34; Yes, Roseanne recognized talent. She brought her homelife into the show often enough, Tom Arnold being the biggest question in existence, but we forgive her for giving us Martin Mull, Sandra Bernhard and the classic Estelle Parsons.The show is real.

For instance, Season 1 was issued with the syndicated edits. The rest of the 8 seasons, for the most part, were the original full-length broadcast versions, although some edits and substitutions having to do with music were made in later seasons. The biggest casualty in this was the season 8 premiere, in which the end credit sequence was a sendup of The Patty Duke Show theme featuring Sarah Chalke and the returning Lecy Goranson as the two Beckys, which can still be seen in syndication, but was edited from the Anchor Bay release, and sadly, remains missing in the Mill Creek release. Some, but not all, of the other edits, have been restored in the Mill Creek releases, such as the removal of When You Wish Upon A Star from the Disney World episodes. If you already own the Anchor Bay DVD's, I would just buy the Mill Creek releases of S1 and the seasons known to have music edits, even if all have still not been restored. But if you don't own any seasons whatsoever, this is the cheapest way to get them as opposed to buying them separately.Each season is presented on 3 DVD discs, with 6-9 episodes per disc. Quality is generally good, with some episodes faring better than others. A couple of episodes on Season 1, including &#34;Mall Story&#34; have momentary pixellation where the image breaks up into green or white pixels, but such instances are only about a second long. I haven't noticed this in any other episodes, but I've only finished seasons 1-5 so far. Most of the bonus features from the Anchor Bay DVD releases have been retained. The episodes do not feature subtitles but are closed captioned, which sadly doesn't work on Blu-Ray players or DVD players using component cable setup.The packaging is not anyone's ideal, let's get that out of the way. It's 27 discs in 27 windowed black paper sleeves stacked on top of one another in a big plastic box with a slipcover over the box. It takes up the shelf space of three standard DVD cases, and one can't help but wish Mill Creek had put this in a slipcase including 3 regular-sized DVD cases, each one containing 3 seasons, to make it a touch more convenient. There are many ways to make it all more convenient, however, so you can pick whichever method of storage you prefer for convenience. I've chosen to keep the discs in the box and just keep one or two seasons out at a time until I've gone through all of them. Also, sadly, there isn't an episode guide to be found inside, but lists of the episodes in each season can be found online and printed off, folded up, and stuck inside the box along with the discs. The paper sleeves can scratch some of the discs in transit, but many players these days can handle DVD's with a few light scratches, or even sometimes not-so-light ones. One disc, which had zero scratches whatsoever, skipped badly in my player and couldn't even be backed up onto the computer. I e-mailed Mill Creek and they sent me a replacement right away, despite their claim that they typically don't replace discs not purchased directly from their website, so if any of your discs don't work, it's worth a shot to e-mail them at the support e-mail givem at millcreekdirect.comDespite packaging woes and the woes one might have from having up to 9 episodes crammed onto a single DVD (which usually only results in around 3.5 hours of video not sourced from film or HD video, meaning compression isn't a major problem as the quality is never going to be pristine anyway) and occasional built-in glitches or varying quality of episodes, you can't go wrong with this set. Don't buy it for more than around $35, as the packaging isn't worth more than that, but this set can be occasionally found on here for $25-$30. (It was $25.99 when I purchased it.) It's been well worth every penny to have all of my favorite Roseanne moments (sadly minus the two Beckys sketch) at my fingertips.

Other recent complete series box sets have the DVDs in one or two prongs without any protection: examples being Charlie's Angles, Married... with Children, Dawson's Creek, and The King of Queens.If the DVDs had to be stacked this way, they could've at least made the prong a little bit deeper where you wouldn't have to struggle to put the DVDs in them.
