335317,A3RX6E9EP1J5WW,6302797616,A Christy,"[1, 1]","I sure wish more people would see this and erase the tepid impression so many other films of Shakespeare's work have left on them. This is certainly one of the best of all those put on film. Taming of the Shrew is a funny work but hard to perform. Without the exactly correct actor, it loses half it's punch as it relies on the facial expressions that will translate the words into feeling. Hard to do from a centuries old work that has very little in the way of director's notes!This masterpiece has the three main elements to greatness locked up: Franco Zeffirelli as the director and Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as the two main characters. Really, given the visual talent of Zeffirelli and the magnetic passion between Taylor and Burton, everything else is bound to fall into place.Like many others, I found the performances of some of the secondary characters not to my exact liking but I think, in retrospect, that it was simply that they were overwhelmed by the talents of the main characters and specifically directed in a way that would create this feeling in the audience. We should feel annoyed by some of those characters and adding a certain tone of voice helps to ensure the audience feels that way. So, I'm not taking anything from the film for that.Taylor as Kate the Shrew and Burton as the wild and unsavory Petruchio are perfect. Burton often has that slightly dirty look to him and his booze roughened voice just adds sauce to the mix. Taylor is at her most beautiful in this movie; no longer so young she is lushly filled out, has character in her face and confidence in her work. The sexual tension between this legendary couple is like over-cooked dynamite, ready to blow in this movie and it lends the final touch to their explosive scenes. You just have to see it to truly appreciate it.The costuming in this film is a notch above superlative with Taylor positively sewn into her bodices and yet still athletic as she races across a roof from her sarcastically effusive husband-to-be.  Burton is a slovenly, yet manly and handsome, mess in his well designed dags and pouffy sleeves. The musical score is also exceptional so it is just as much a feast for the ears as the eyes.You don't have to be a fan of Shakespeare to enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a fan of older ""classic"" movies either. You just have to enjoy a good movie experience overall to really love this film. It's an excellent way to introduce Shakespeare to those who might shy away from it also.",5,"Sumptuous Feast for the Eyes, Ears and Heart",1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2501,"['sure', 'wish', 'more', 'people', 'would', 'see', 'erase', 'tepid', 'impression', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Shakespeare', 'work', 'have', 'left', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'put', 'film', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'funny', 'work', 'hard', 'perform', 'exactly', 'correct', 'actor', 'half', 'punch', 'facial', 'expressions', 'will', 'translate', 'words', 'feeling', 'Hard', 'do', 'centuries', 'old', 'work', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'director', 'notes', 'masterpiece', 'three', 'main', 'elements', 'greatness', 'locked', 'up', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'director', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Really', 'given', 'visual', 'talent', 'Zeffirelli', 'magnetic', 'passion', 'Taylor', 'Burton', 'everything', 'else', 'bound', 'fall', 'place.Like', 'many', 'others', 'found', 'performances', 'secondary', 'characters', 'not', 'exact', 'liking', 'think', 'retrospect', 'was', 'simply', 'were', 'overwhelmed', 'talents', 'main', 'characters', 'specifically', 'directed', 'way', 'would', 'create', 'feeling', 'audience', 'should', 'feel', 'annoyed', 'characters', 'adding', 'certain', 'tone', 'voice', 'ensure', 'audience', 'feels', 'way', 'So', ""'m"", 'not', 'taking', 'anything', 'film', 'that.Taylor', 'Kate', 'Shrew', 'Burton', 'wild', 'unsavory', 'Petruchio', 'are', 'perfect', 'Burton', 'often', 'slightly', 'dirty', 'look', 'booze', 'roughened', 'voice', 'just', 'sauce', 'mix', 'Taylor', 'most', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'no', 'longer', 'so', 'young', 'lushly', 'filled', 'out', 'character', 'face', 'confidence', 'work', 'sexual', 'tension', 'legendary', 'couple', 'over-cooked', 'dynamite', 'ready', 'blow', 'movie', 'final', 'touch', 'explosive', 'scenes', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'it.The', 'costuming', 'film', 'notch', 'superlative', 'Taylor', 'positively', 'sewn', 'bodices', 'yet', 'still', 'athletic', 'roof', 'sarcastically', 'effusive', 'husband-to-be', 'Burton', 'slovenly', 'yet', 'manly', 'handsome', 'mess', 'well', 'designed', 'dags', 'pouffy', 'sleeves', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'exceptional', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'feast', 'ears', 'eyes.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'Shakespeare', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'older', 'classic', 'movies', 'just', 'have', 'enjoy', 'good', 'movie', 'experience', 'overall', 'really', 'love', 'film', 'excellent', 'way', 'introduce', 'Shakespeare', 'who', 'might', 'shy', 'away', 'also']",N/A

335321,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302797616,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","`The Taming of the Shrew' is not an unfamiliar piece.  It is one of Shakespeare's more well-known works, and it has been adapted a few times to varying degrees of success.  It may sound taboo or possibly amateurish to say that the 1999 modern retelling `10 Things I Hate About You' is one of the best, but you must give praise where it is due.  Sadly, this 1967 classical interpretation starring two of the finest actors of all time, Taylor and Burton, is a miserable failure.Yes, it is pretty, and Burton is a commanding force (complete with natural charm) but the film is a chaotic mess and Taylor's insane portrayal of Katharina is not only eyesore but a complete ear-splitter.  I honestly had no idea she could reach those levels of uncomfortable scenery chewing, but she hammed her way through every scene and ruined the film.  It didn't help that the entire supporting cast seemed miscast and pretty much felt uncomfortable in their roles.  I wanted so badly to slap so many people and shake some sense into every involved.Richard Burton deserves a TON of respect for giving so much naturalism and believable heft to this film.Like I said, it is pretty.  The costumes and sets and overall visual scope of the film is great, but it is so choppy, so unevenly paced and toned (I wasn't sure if I was supposed to laugh or cry or fall in love, and so I basically cringed throughout 90% of the film) that it basically wasted all potential.

335323,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6302797616,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","One of the reasons I love Shakespeare's plays in films is that it tends to attract the best and they do their best efforts. Franco Zeffirelli is one of the best directors of the 20th century, as will be evident when you look at what he's done. He managed to get Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, at the height of their considerable powers, for Katerina and Petruchio. They even invested $1 million of their own money in the production! Michael York, young and completely charming, makes a superb Lucentio, and Natasha Pyne a sweet and graceful Bianca. The costumes and sets, the props, are all very authentic-appearing, and far more convincing than any stage play could provide.As the story opens, we are introduced to these characters. Bianca, veiled in a fine white veil and dressed in a lovely pale blue, has stopped to look at the revelers on what appears to be April Fool's Day. The young men surround her and sing to her, with somewhat bawdy lyrics. She laughs and teases a little until a servant comes to fetch her home, as her sister is throwing a fit. Meanwhile, Lucentio has seen her and as he explained to his servant, ""I burn!"" They follow her home and discover that (1) her older sister Katerina is a screaming shrew and (2) their father is determined that he will not give Bianca in marriage until Katerina has been wed.In addition to the young and handsome Lucentio, there's a somewhat older man and a genuinely ancient one who are both trying to get Bianca for wife. Father says no, but you may send me tutors so she can learn music and languages and ""keep to her books"" until her older sister is wed. They immediately organize a scheme to use this search for tutors to their own advantage. Petruchio shows up at his friend's house (the younger one who lusts after Bianca) announcing that his father has died and he has come to find a wife. A wife with money. And he doesn't care if she is a shrew, so long as she has money.Obvious, isn't it? Meanwhile Lucentio has disguised his servant as himself, and has turned himself into a tutor, so that he can be near Bianca. Petruchio's friend had the same idea, but of course makes a fool of himself. Actually, everyone is into making fools of themselves in this film.Petruchio appears at the wealthy father's door determined to win Kate for his own. He proudly declares, ""For I am rough, and woo not like a babe."" Father insists she must consent. So follows the most hilarious romp I've seen in a movie in many a year, with Petruchio declaring that Kate is sweet and modest and all things virtuous while she is throwing things at him and screaming at him. She runs away into a storeroom, which the two of them pretty effectively destroy until he finally catches her in a pile of loose wool fleece and declares, ""Will you, nil you, I will wed you.""And of course she does. The funniest part is when she is asked by the priest if she will take Petruchio as her lawfully wedded husband, she pulls back her veil and shouts ""I will n--"" and Petruchio stifles what was obviously going to be the word ""not"" with a big kiss!Petruchio takes Kate back to his home, which is full of dust and cobwebs and incompetent servants. By techniques which were described in detail in the book ""Brainwash,"" he persuades her that her only choice is to obey him.So they go to her father's house to attend the wedding of her sister to Lucentio. (Still being portrayed by his servant.) Instead, the real Lucentio and Bianca go to a priest and get married in secret. So there was a party planned, so they have the party.After the dinner, when the ladies have retired to another room, Petruchio makes a wager for 4,000 pieces of gold with Lucentio and his friend, who has married a widow. Each of them will send for their wives, and the winner is the one whose wife obeys most promptly. Lucentio starts, and Bianca sends the messenger back to say she is busy and cannot come. Then Petruchio's friend sends for his wife, and she sends the messenger back to say that she will not come, but he should come to her. Finally, Petruchio sends his servant to fetch Kate.Kate not only appears promptly, but has both other wives in tow, dragging them into the banquet hall. Then she gives her famous speech about how wives should obey their husbands. ""I am ashamed that women are so simple that they make war when they should sue for peace. That they would seek for supremacy and sway when they are made to serve, love and obey."" Petruchio not only wins the bet, he is enormously proud of his wife, ""Aye, there's a wench!"" he says, and finally, ""Kiss me, Kate!"" She does, passionately, and they leave the feast together.",4,"Not Politically Correct, But Shakespeare Doesn't Have to Be",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,4645,"['One', 'reasons', 'love', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'films', 'attract', 'best', 'do', 'best', 'efforts', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'one', 'best', 'directors', '20th', 'century', 'will', 'be', 'evident', 'when', 'look', 'what', 'done', 'managed', 'get', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'height', 'considerable', 'powers', 'Katerina', 'Petruchio', 'even', 'invested', '1', 'million', 'own', 'money', 'production', 'Michael', 'York', 'young', 'completely', 'charming', 'superb', 'Lucentio', 'Natasha', 'Pyne', 'sweet', 'graceful', 'Bianca', 'costumes', 'sets', 'props', 'are', 'very', 'authentic-appearing', 'far', 'more', 'convincing', 'stage', 'play', 'could', 'provide.As', 'story', 'are', 'introduced', 'characters', 'Bianca', 'veiled', 'fine', 'white', 'veil', 'dressed', 'lovely', 'pale', 'blue', 'stopped', 'look', 'revelers', 'what', 'be', 'April', 'Fool', 'Day', 'young', 'men', 'surround', 'sing', 'somewhat', 'bawdy', 'lyrics', 'little', 'servant', 'fetch', 'home', 'sister', 'throwing', 'fit', 'Meanwhile', 'Lucentio', 'seen', 'explained', 'servant', 'burn', 'follow', 'home', 'discover', '1', 'older', 'sister', 'Katerina', 'screaming', 'shrew', '2', 'father', 'determined', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'Bianca', 'marriage', 'Katerina', 'been', 'wed.In', 'addition', 'young', 'handsome', 'Lucentio', 'somewhat', 'older', 'man', 'genuinely', 'ancient', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'Bianca', 'wife', 'Father', 'may', 'send', 'tutors', 'can', 'learn', 'music', 'languages', 'keep', 'books', 'older', 'sister', 'wed', 'immediately', 'organize', 'scheme', 'use', 'search', 'tutors', 'own', 'advantage', 'Petruchio', 'up', 'friend', 'house', 'younger', 'one', 'who', 'Bianca', 'announcing', 'father', 'died', 'come', 'find', 'wife', 'wife', 'money', ""n't"", 'care', 'shrew', 'so', 'long', 'money.Obvious', ""n't"", 'Meanwhile', 'Lucentio', 'disguised', 'servant', 'turned', 'tutor', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'near', 'Bianca', 'Petruchio', 'friend', 'had', 'same', 'idea', 'course', 'fool', 'Actually', 'everyone', 'making', 'fools', 'film.Petruchio', 'wealthy', 'father', 'door', 'determined', 'win', 'Kate', 'own', 'proudly', 'am', 'rough', 'not', 'babe', 'Father', 'must', 'consent', 'So', 'most', 'hilarious', 'romp', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'many', 'year', 'Petruchio', 'declaring', 'Kate', 'sweet', 'modest', 'things', 'virtuous', 'throwing', 'things', 'screaming', 'away', 'storeroom', 'two', 'pretty', 'effectively', 'destroy', 'finally', 'pile', 'loose', 'wool', 'fleece', 'declares', 'Will', 'nil', 'will', 'wed', 'course', 'funniest', 'part', 'when', 'asked', 'priest', 'will', 'take', 'Petruchio', 'lawfully', 'wedded', 'husband', 'back', 'veil', 'will', 'n', 'Petruchio', 'what', 'was', 'obviously', 'going', 'be', 'word', 'not', 'big', 'kiss', 'Petruchio', 'Kate', 'back', 'home', 'full', 'dust', 'cobwebs', 'incompetent', 'servants', 'techniques', 'were', 'described', 'detail', 'book', 'Brainwash', 'only', 'choice', 'obey', 'him.So', 'go', 'father', 'house', 'attend', 'wedding', 'sister', 'Lucentio', 'Still', 'being', 'portrayed', 'servant', 'Instead', 'real', 'Lucentio', 'Bianca', 'go', 'priest', 'get', 'married', 'secret', 'So', 'was', 'party', 'planned', 'have', 'party.After', 'dinner', 'when', 'ladies', 'have', 'retired', 'room', 'Petruchio', 'wager', '4,000', 'pieces', 'gold', 'Lucentio', 'friend', 'who', 'married', 'widow', 'will', 'send', 'wives', 'winner', 'one', 'wife', 'most', 'promptly', 'Lucentio', 'Bianca', 'messenger', 'back', 'say', 'busy', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'Then', 'Petruchio', 'friend', 'wife', 'messenger', 'back', 'say', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'should', 'come', 'Finally', 'Petruchio', 'servant', 'fetch', 'Kate.Kate', 'not', 'only', 'promptly', 'other', 'wives', 'tow', 'dragging', 'banquet', 'hall', 'Then', 'famous', 'speech', 'how', 'wives', 'should', 'obey', 'husbands', 'am', 'ashamed', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'simple', 'make', 'war', 'when', 'should', 'sue', 'peace', 'would', 'seek', 'supremacy', 'sway', 'when', 'are', 'made', 'serve', 'love', 'Petruchio', 'not', 'only', 'bet', 'enormously', 'proud', 'wife', 'Aye', 'wench', 'finally', 'Kiss', 'Kate', 'passionately', 'leave', 'feast', 'together']",N/A

335326,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6302797616,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[5, 6]","Along with ""The Comedy of Errors,"" ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" and ""The Merry Wives of Windsor,"" I always liked this comedy of Shakespeare's. As usual, Director Franco Zeffirelli brings the written material to the screen better than any of us could have expected. Some people complained that it was a bit overdone and rompish, but remember, this is a comedy, so you can get away that. Basically, this story involves 2 subplots that the master Shakespeare cleverly intertwines. Lucentio (Michael York, whom you may recall as Tybalt in ""Romeo and Juliet), along with 2 rivals (Hortensio and Gremio) are in love with Bianca. But the problem is, Bianca's father Baptista will not allow Bianca to marry until her older and more shrewish sister Kate (Elizabeth Taylor) marries. Financial negotiations are of course mandatory in the cases of marriage here, (and if we think that is in the past, we are only kidding ourselves). Well, moving on Kate's shrewish nature makes the prospect of this unlikely. So, Bianca's suitors team up to at least resolve the matter of Kate first. Some people feel this is a sexist play, but if we look at Isaac Asimov's views, we find the play is not so. Asimov convincingly explains  in his book ""Asimov's Guide To Shakespeare"" the hidden picture. Bianca is not exactly so sweet. Rather, she is manipulative and has learned to monopolize her father's love, as well as the love of other people. We can also infer that Kate is not really a bad person. Rather, she is tired of the fact that her father virtually ignores her, and she is so scarred from this neglect, that she can't even see love when it is given (even though she so desperately wants it). And of course, the people who taunt her and tease her don't help the situation! Director Franco Zeffirelli does kind of hint at this. Moving on, in comes Petruchio (Richard Burton and Elizabeth's at the time husband). It may appear that Petruchio is only after the financial benefit of marrying Kate, but later situations prove otherwise. One charming bonus is that while Shakespeare has their wedding off stage, and explained, Mr. Zeffirelli shows the comical wedding for us to see. At first, it may seem that Petruchio is also cruel to Kate, but in reality, he is using a form of behavior modification, and if he did not love her, he wouldn't be going through the trouble that he does. In some ways, a more appropriate title to the play would be ""The Rehabilitative Therapy of A Neglected Daughter."" To be sure, Baptista is not exactly cruel to Kate, but he made no secret of the fact that he liked Bianca better. (Some parents try to at least hide the fact that they have a favorite child.) Well, Shakespeare switches back to the other plot, and Lucentio and Bianca can marry IF, Lucentio can prove he has the fortunes he says he does.

Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","In Italy, Franco Zeffirelli is best known for his work in grand opera, and he brought all his experience in this larger than life art form to bear upon the two films for which he is best known, the 1968 ROMEO AND JULIET and the 1967 THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.Scholars usually consider Shakespeare's THE TAMING OF THE SHREW to be among the playwrights lesser works, but it has been an audience favorite since its first known performance in 1594.  Although many suitors beg for Bianca's hand, her widowed father is determined that she may not marry until her elder sister Katherine is wed--and Katherine is a hot tempered, willful, and vicious woman who makes life miserable for all who cross her path.  Fortunately for Bianca, Petruchio is in need of money, and he is more than willing to marry Kate, no matter how resistant Kate herself is to the whole idea.Shakespeare's original script has been trimmed here and there, and while purists may scream about it the result not only works for film, it also manages to capture the flavor of Shakespeare's language much better than any other film version of SHREW both before or since.  And the look of the thing is beautiful: Zeffirelli brings his mastery of opera's larger than life visuals to bear upon the project, and the result is eye-popping production values, most particularly in reference to the costuming.  Every cent spent shows on the screen.Although she was a very fine screen actress, Elizabeth Taylor is not a name one would expect to find playing Shakespeare--but she carries it off in fine style, kicking, snapping, and snarling with tremendous panache in the first portion of the film, and then making Kate's ""taming"" seem entirely plausible in the latter portion.  Unlike many later Shakespeare plays, SHREW is not greatly noted for its language; even so, Katherine's final speech is widely known and extremely memorable, and Taylor pulls it off with such credibility that one wishes she had done other classical roles as well.Taylor's then-husband Richard Burton co-stars as the deliberately uncouth Petruchio, who sets out to tame a shrew and finds himself as much tamed by her as she by him.  Burton, of course, was accustomed to the classics in general and Shakespeare in particular, and he plays with tremendous bravado.  The supporting cast, which includes a young Michael York, is also very fine, and when all is said and done the 1964 THE TAMING OF THE SHREW is a tremendous amount of fun even if you don't like Shakespeare.The DVD transfer is very nice.  The picture has the occasional blemish, most often in the opening titles and closing credits, but on the whole it is remarkable, showing every detail of every set and every costume to fine effect.

Seven Brides for seven brother definately took ""inspiration"" from the ""Taming of the Shrew"". Shakespeares ""Taming of the Shrew"" story line is much better than ""Cinderella"".  I loved the comedy, drama, and underlying love story.1. Bianca has a number of admirers: Lucentio, Gremio, and Hortensio, but her father, Baptista Minola will not allow marriage until the older sister Katharina is married.  Kate has a fiery tough and lashes Minola affection statements towards Bianca.  Kate enraged destroys furniture, throws pottery, and curses a storm.2. Biance's suitors convince Pertruchio to court Kate and win the dowry.  Lucentio, a student changes roles and offers himself as Bianca's tutor.  Shortly after, the real father of Lucentio arrives in town and confronts his imposter.  Lucentio has to quick talk to passify his father. Gremio wants Bianca for himself, but Lucentio gets the girl.  Lucentio, domestic and stable, young and strong, is the better choice.3. Kate thinks to outsmart Pertruchio and embarrass him at the marriage alter, but before she can declare ""I will not marry him"", Pertruchio kisses her mid sentence after ""I will"".  Pertruchio is late, drunk, and displays crass mannerism upon his church arrival.  Petruchio thinks little of the religious ceremony and less affection towards the clergy.4. Petruchio departs early from the marriage party with his servant Grumio.  Petruchio compels Kate to leave with him, as his possession.  Kate rides on a donkey and realizes hopeless that she can not return home.  Now, Petruchio is not forcing her to follow, but out of necessity Kate follows.5. Kate arrives at Petruchio's house but Petruchio denies her food.6. Petruchio receives a letter announcing Bianca wedding to Lucentio and orders a dress designed and crafted for Kate, but finds fault with the dress and shreds the dress.  Kate is forced to wear old clothes.7. Petruchio gambles for 4,000 ducats on who has the most obedient wife.  Each wife is asked to return to the room, but denies the request and only Kate obeys her husband.  The room is shocked.  Petruchio dominates and Kate submits to his request for a kiss.",5,Kiss me Kate.,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2197,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'immensely', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'was', 'great', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'seven', 'brother', 'definately', 'took', 'inspiration', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'story', 'line', 'much', 'better', 'Cinderella', 'loved', 'comedy', 'drama', 'underlying', 'love', 'story.1', 'Bianca', 'number', 'admirers', 'Lucentio', 'Gremio', 'Hortensio', 'father', 'Baptista', 'Minola', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'marriage', 'older', 'sister', 'Katharina', 'married', 'Kate', 'fiery', 'tough', 'lashes', 'Minola', 'affection', 'statements', 'Bianca', 'Kate', 'enraged', 'destroys', 'furniture', 'pottery', 'storm.2', 'Biance', 'suitors', 'convince', 'Pertruchio', 'court', 'Kate', 'win', 'dowry', 'Lucentio', 'student', 'roles', 'Bianca', 'tutor', 'Shortly', 'real', 'father', 'Lucentio', 'arrives', 'town', 'confronts', 'imposter', 'Lucentio', 'quick', 'talk', 'passify', 'father', 'Gremio', 'Bianca', 'Lucentio', 'girl', 'Lucentio', 'domestic', 'stable', 'young', 'strong', 'better', 'choice.3', 'Kate', 'outsmart', 'Pertruchio', 'embarrass', 'marriage', 'alter', 'can', 'declare', 'will', 'not', 'marry', 'Pertruchio', 'mid', 'sentence', 'will', 'Pertruchio', 'late', 'drunk', 'displays', 'crass', 'mannerism', 'church', 'arrival', 'Petruchio', 'little', 'religious', 'ceremony', 'less', 'affection', 'clergy.4', 'Petruchio', 'early', 'marriage', 'party', 'servant', 'Grumio', 'Petruchio', 'compels', 'Kate', 'leave', 'possession', 'Kate', 'donkey', 'hopeless', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'home', 'Now', 'Petruchio', 'not', 'forcing', 'follow', 'necessity', 'Kate', 'follows.5', 'Kate', 'Petruchio', 'house', 'Petruchio', 'food.6', 'Petruchio', 'letter', 'announcing', 'Bianca', 'wedding', 'Lucentio', 'orders', 'dress', 'designed', 'crafted', 'Kate', 'fault', 'dress', 'dress', 'Kate', 'forced', 'wear', 'old', 'clothes.7', 'Petruchio', 'gambles', '4,000', 'ducats', 'who', 'most', 'obedient', 'wife', 'wife', 'asked', 'return', 'room', 'request', 'only', 'Kate', 'obeys', 'husband', 'room', 'shocked', 'Petruchio', 'dominates', 'Kate', 'submits', 'request', 'kiss']",N/A

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[4, 5]","While married to each other Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor made a lot of movies, some of which are hardly worth watching. This one fortunately does not fall into that category. Based of course on Mr. Shakespeare's comedy by the same name, THE TAMING OF THE SHREW succeeds on every level. It is infused with the genius of the director Franco Zeffirelli (ROMEO AND JULIET) from start to finish. The photography, the soundtrack and the costumes are perfect. There is a host of motley minor characters who always remain in character. Burton and Taylor fill up the screen with their portrayals of Petruchio and Kate. Burton proves he is a great comic actor and Taylor, who has never been more beautiful, certainly gives a fine performance as the ""shrew"" who gets tamed. Notice her eyes and hands when she and Burton kneel for their marriage vows if you are one of those who doubt her acting ability. (We are quite certain she is acting because we are suspect that no man ever tamed her in real life.)The plot is simple. Batista, a rich man from Padua, wants his younger daughter Bianca (Natasha Pyne) married, but his older daughter Katarina must wed first. In the end, after the over-the-top wedding of Kate and Petruchio, Lucentio (Michael York) gets the young and more modest Bianca. Only occasionally do the physical antics of Taylor and Burton get a bit too much. Of course the story is as politically incorrect as you can imagine. There are no parts here for Alan Alda. It is a comedy after all, so don't take it too seriously.This film holds up very, very well after almost 40 years, proving once again that almost anything connected with Shakespeare lasts.",5,One of the Burton-Taylor Duo's Best Offerings,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,1664,"['married', 'other', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'made', 'lot', 'movies', 'are', 'hardly', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'fortunately', 'not', 'fall', 'category', 'Based', 'course', 'Mr.', 'Shakespeare', 'comedy', 'same', 'name', 'THE', 'TAMING', 'THE', 'SHREW', 'level', 'infused', 'genius', 'director', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'ROMEO', 'AND', 'JULIET', 'start', 'finish', 'photography', 'soundtrack', 'costumes', 'are', 'perfect', 'host', 'motley', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'always', 'remain', 'character', 'Burton', 'Taylor', 'fill', 'up', 'screen', 'portrayals', 'Petruchio', 'Kate', 'Burton', 'great', 'comic', 'actor', 'Taylor', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'beautiful', 'certainly', 'fine', 'performance', 'shrew', 'who', 'tamed', 'Notice', 'eyes', 'hands', 'when', 'Burton', 'kneel', 'marriage', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'doubt', 'acting', 'ability', 'are', 'quite', 'certain', 'acting', 'are', 'suspect', 'man', 'ever', 'tamed', 'real', 'life', 'plot', 'simple', 'Batista', 'rich', 'man', 'Padua', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Bianca', 'Natasha', 'Pyne', 'married', 'older', 'daughter', 'Katarina', 'must', 'wed', 'first', 'end', 'over-the-top', 'wedding', 'Kate', 'Petruchio', 'Lucentio', 'Michael', 'York', 'young', 'more', 'modest', 'Bianca', 'Only', 'occasionally', 'do', 'physical', 'antics', 'Taylor', 'Burton', 'get', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'course', 'story', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'can', 'imagine', 'are', 'parts', 'here', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'comedy', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously.This', 'film', 'up', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'proving', 'once', 'again', 'almost', 'anything', 'connected', 'Shakespeare', 'lasts']",N/A

This movie has a greater meaning to me since I have recently been to Italy and visited Padua, where the setting of this tale takes place.So onto Pauda during the Italian Renaissance, this tale of Kate and her love begin...Did I say LOVE? Well, let's not begin there. Let's begin at the beginning, as J.R.R. Tolkien likes to say..There once was a wealthy man with two beautiful daughters. The sweet and virtuous Bianca, so fair and trite. The other sister being as wicked and wild as the color of her hair...raven black.Her name to all is Katherine (Elizabeth Taylor), but otherwise known to the small community as the wild &quot;Kat&quot;.Bianca, fair and true has fallen in love. Her father wants her married to a wealthy man, but Bianca has other plans.  She wants to marry the young, handsome boy (Michael York) that caught her eye in the town square.  But Alas, much to Bianca's dismay, her father says &quot;Not till' your sister marries first!&quot;  I say, poor Bianca..because WHO in their right mind would marry such a wild and hateful woman?Kate is wild indeed, spending her time torturing her sister with whips and abuse. She despises her younger sister for her vanity and spoiled ways.  Bianca is truly one of literature's first &quot;daddy's girl&quot;, maddening Kate futher with her &quot;Oh Daddy!&quot; weepy ways.As revenge, Kate promises Bianca she will NOT marry just despite her.  All hope seems lost. Bianca's many pursuers come up with a plan. They will indeed find someone who will woo and marry Katherine.  The person they they have in mind is the stinky, obnoxious, fat, and loathesome Petruchio (Richard Burton).Will the plan work?  While Bianca and her suitors watch through literally closed doors, the wooing begins.  Petruchio WILL have Kate as a bride, for her father has promised him a large sum of money if he wins her hand.Petruchio finds he must literally trap and force Kate into marriage.  The scenes of his pursual of Kate are nothing short of comical-he even dares to call out the most famous words: &quot;Kiss me Kate!&quot;, as she is slapping and hitting him.  She finds him disgusting...shutting herself away in her room.  Petruchio is so certain of his charm, that he waits at the altar for his beloved Sweet Kate to arrive...dressed like a clown to add insult to an already frightful situation...he awaits her arrival( and wait and wait he does). Bets are placed. Will she show?  Has Petruchio tamed the wild shrew or will she leave him at the altar?This is as far as I dare go...the comedy that insues from this point on is nothing short of hardy laughs. Sweet Kate (as he calls her) surprises everyone throughout the length of this sumptuously beautiful movie. She does not disappoint!William Shakespeare has filled this wonderful of tales with proper sarcasm and all the right comedy one needs to fall in love with this movie. It is truly a classic.  The setting, the elegant clothes, and of course the acting between Liz and Richard surpass many Shakespearian movies.  I highly recommend this as one to own and enjoy forever.",5,Oh Sweet Kate!,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,3225,"['Next', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'quot', 'Henry', 'V', 'quot', 'favorite', 'Shakespearian', 'movie', 'adore', 'movie', 'have', 'loved', 'was', 'teenager', 'movie', 'greater', 'meaning', 'have', 'recently', 'been', 'Italy', 'visited', 'Padua', 'where', 'setting', 'tale', 'place.So', 'Pauda', 'Italian', 'Renaissance', 'tale', 'Kate', 'love', 'begin', 'Did', 'say', 'LOVE', 'Well', 'let', 'not', 'begin', 'there', 'Let', 'begin', 'beginning', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'say..There', 'once', 'was', 'wealthy', 'man', 'two', 'beautiful', 'daughters', 'sweet', 'virtuous', 'Bianca', 'so', 'fair', 'trite', 'other', 'sister', 'being', 'wicked', 'wild', 'color', 'hair', 'black.Her', 'name', 'Katherine', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'otherwise', 'known', 'small', 'community', 'wild', 'quot', 'Kat', 'quot', '.Bianca', 'fair', 'true', 'fallen', 'love', 'father', 'married', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Bianca', 'other', 'plans', 'marry', 'young', 'handsome', 'boy', 'Michael', 'York', 'caught', 'eye', 'town', 'square', 'Alas', 'much', 'Bianca', 'dismay', 'father', 'quot', 'Not', 'till', 'sister', 'marries', 'first', 'quot', 'say', 'poor', 'Bianca..because', 'WHO', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'marry', 'such', 'wild', 'hateful', 'woman', 'Kate', 'wild', 'indeed', 'spending', 'time', 'torturing', 'sister', 'whips', 'abuse', 'younger', 'sister', 'vanity', 'spoiled', 'ways', 'Bianca', 'truly', 'one', 'literature', 'first', 'quot', 'daddy', 'girl', 'quot', 'maddening', 'Kate', 'futher', 'quot', 'Oh', 'Daddy', 'quot', 'ways.As', 'revenge', 'Kate', 'Bianca', 'will', 'NOT', 'marry', 'just', 'hope', 'lost', 'Bianca', 'many', 'pursuers', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'will', 'indeed', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'woo', 'marry', 'Katherine', 'person', 'have', 'mind', 'stinky', 'obnoxious', 'fat', 'loathesome', 'Petruchio', 'Richard', 'Burton', '.Will', 'plan', 'work', 'Bianca', 'suitors', 'watch', 'literally', 'closed', 'doors', 'wooing', 'Petruchio', 'WILL', 'have', 'Kate', 'bride', 'father', 'promised', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'hand.Petruchio', 'must', 'literally', 'trap', 'force', 'Kate', 'marriage', 'scenes', 'pursual', 'Kate', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'comical-he', 'even', 'call', 'out', 'most', 'famous', 'words', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'Kate', 'quot', 'slapping', 'hitting', 'disgusting', 'shutting', 'away', 'room', 'Petruchio', 'so', 'certain', 'charm', 'altar', 'beloved', 'Sweet', 'Kate', 'arrive', 'dressed', 'clown', 'add', 'insult', 'already', 'frightful', 'situation', 'arrival', 'wait', 'wait', 'Bets', 'are', 'placed', 'Will', 'show', 'Has', 'Petruchio', 'tamed', 'wild', 'shrew', 'will', 'leave', 'altar', 'as', 'far', 'dare', 'go', 'comedy', 'point', 'nothing', 'short', 'hardy', 'laughs', 'Sweet', 'Kate', 'everyone', 'length', 'sumptuously', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'not', 'disappoint', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'tales', 'proper', 'sarcasm', 'right', 'comedy', 'one', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'truly', 'classic', 'setting', 'elegant', 'clothes', 'course', 'acting', 'Liz', 'Richard', 'surpass', 'many', 'Shakespearian', 'movies', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'own', 'enjoy', 'forever']",N/A

You get a signature big plush production from Franco Zeffirelli.  You also get a very skimpy serving of Shakespeare to go with the heaping plate of stars and stuff.  I would be surprised if I did an actual count and found half the text in the movie script.  Large sections of the primary story line and even key speeches, such as Kate's final speech about duty to husbands are hacked up or omitted.  I am not a purist or completist, still I was amazed at how much star pandering and  material production value tromped all over the play.  It does manage to be funny from time to time.  But taken as a whole this movie is for fans of Taylor, Burton, and good looking movies for their own sake.Fortunately, one can do better, much better.If you want to see Taming of the Shrew with great acting, great direction, broad humor, and most of what Shakespeare wrote, I recommend the Broadway Archive DVD of William Ball's San Francisco ACT production with Marc Singer.  This is the best and funniest production I have ever seen.  (Yes, it is actually funny.)  I urge you to get it while you can, there is no better.

335351,A1PP6TSNECELE4,6302797616,J. Center,"[20, 30]","It's very difficult to be very critical of such a roisterous, good-natured version of Shakespeare's rowdiest play, and in truth one has to admit that this is probably the first of the truly modern Shakespeare films.  There are some real assets here -- Zefferelli's eye has never lighted on a landscape more beautiful, more seductive, and Nina Rota's score fits beautifully.But Shakespeare, even on film, stands or falls on the acting.  This version -- with one exception -- is filled with one-note performances (they're very GOOD notes, but single notes nonetheless).  Let's deal with the exception first -- Elizabeth Taylor is a delightful, intelligent Katarina.  Her development is exactly what Shakespeare obviously intended, and if her early scenes are a bit uniformly shrill, the case could be made that that's what the Bard wrote.  In general, she's an admirable Kate.Burton, however, is something else entirely.  Despite his acknowledged skill with Shakespeare (his Hamlet was glorious), he takes a monochromatic approach to Petruchio, with an annoyingly stagey laugh running through virtually every scene.  By halfway through the film, you tend to want him to get off screen so you don't have to listen to that &quot;manly&quot; laugh any longer.  Unfortunately, much of Kate's dialogue was cut (the assumption being, I suppose, that Taylor would have trouble with the language) while too much of Petruchio remains.The secondary characters, if cut from different bolts of cloth, are all a single color.

The centuries-old language doesn't get in the way at all, and that is saying a lot.  In most Shakespeare adaptations that stay somewhat true to his written words, the language is often ponderous and awkward to today's ear, and just seems ""Shakespearean"", but with these great actors all that is avoided and we just see the story develop.  This is ""painless Shakespeare"", yet true Shakespeare.Liz plays the comic character Katherine, the shrew.  She is comically shrewish in the beginning of the movie as she chases her sister around with a whip, God knows why, her sister being an inoffensive creature.  Her mercenary betrothed, Petruchio, who is ""only in it for the money"", manages to tame her of her shrewishness, her violence, her demanding and negative personality, without ever getting violent with her, without really dominating her verbally.  He does it by .... well I don't really know how he does it.Katherine's speech at the end, the highlight of the play and of the movie, is wonderful, especially to a man's ears.  It is full of appreciation for the man of the house, which is a sentiment lacking in America today.  She praises husbands for devoting their lives to supporting their wives, and those husbands who support their wives deserve her praise, and you can bet they don't get it at home.  She goes way overboard, with her talk of the wife obeying her husband as if she were a servant, but it's sweet to hear such a generous attitude.When she doesn't even argue with her husband as he tells her one preposterous thing after another, I want to get a divorce and marry her, not for her looks, not for her dowry, but just to get away from all the arguing!

Every set, every costume represents what most likely played on Shakespeare's own stage so many centuries ago. His attention to detail is extraordinary. However, there is one detail he does not seem to pay enough attention to: the actual movie.This is Zeffirelli's great weakness. It ruins all of his films. He does not seems to care whether he his actors can act or the story can be carried, as long as it looks good. And it does; Elizabeth Taylor is so beautiful that one could easily sit through this movie just for her sake. It is strange, though, that while Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton played a great version of Katharine and Petruchio in their personal relationship, they ignite no sparks in this film. Taylor really carries the film, but Burton does not really put any kind of personality into his role. And because of their lack of chemistry, the comedy in this movie is mainly slapstick based and does not come from Shakespeare's own writing. For example, the scene when Petruchio and Katharine first meet is not the battle of wit and innuendo that it is in the play; in this movie, the sparring is a literal one that takes place in a huge pile of feathers. It is an absence that would be greatly missed by those who loved the play.Those who love The Taming of the Shrew do not have many options when it comes to movies. There is Ten Things I Hate About You, a horrible update that has very little to do with Shakespeare. There is also a version of The Taming of the Shrew that was filmed while Meryl Streep and Raul Julia performed it in Central Park, but while Raul Julia is a hilariously sexy Petruchio, Meryl Streep's Katharine is more of a hag.

Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[21, 23]","A rollicking feast for the eye, ear, and funny bone, Franco Zeffirelli's ""The Taming of The Shrew"" is a tour de force for Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. This pared down version of William Shakespeare's play is a fit morsel for anyone suffering from a fear of the Bard. It's fast pace keeps things going and with a cast of well-known British stars the whole thing is served up to delectable visual perfection.Richard Burton blends his fabled abilities as a Shakespearian genius with his star power to give us a ribald and loveable Petruchio. This is one of his crowning moments on the screen and we are lucky to have this record of Mr. Burton at his very best.Elizabeth Taylor is a comic revelation in this, one of her jewels in her acting crown.  At the time the film came out, many scoffed at the idea of a mere movie star taking on the challenges of Shakespeare. Miss Taylor rises to the challenge and shines as a stunning, sexy and very funny Kate, in fact she more than rises to the occasion, she shows her command of the medium of film and her understanding of comic timing. The wedding scene is a pure Zeffirelli invention. If you didn't know better you would swear that it was part of the play, it is so well done in faux Shakespeare. Elizabeth shines in this scene. In the final fifteen minutes when she delivers the famous ""Lord and Master"" speech she is triumphant as she submits to her man. At the same time we know that she is the one who holds all the cards and in the off stage end will rule the roost from now on, all the while letting poor Petruchio think he is king.The chemistry of Burton and Taylor is pure dynamite that explodes in riotous color across Zeffirelli's Renaissance canvas.

One suspects that Ms. Taylor had a ball, hurling insults and various pieces of furniture at her real-life, on-again off-again, spouse.

335383,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,6302797616,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[7, 7]","Surely, part of the point of making movies of Shakespeare's plays today is to make them accessible to a public who wouldn't ordinarily come into contact with his work. I think where movies like Kenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' fail is in their unwavering and admirable (if somewhat confusing) adherence to the original script. Franco Zeffirelli's 1967 production, starring Richard Burton as the chauvanistic and gold-digging Petrucchio, and Elizabeth Taylor as the waspish, unstable Katharina, is the opposite - it's a sort of 'Shakespeare Lite' version of the Bard's oroginal play, and for the subject matter, this works better. 'Taming' is a farcical comedy about a shrewish, willful spinster, and the gold-digging once-wealthy nobleman who marries her for money, but comes to realise her worth as a wife.Taylor and Burton are, as usual, wonderfully larger-than-life. Burton turns in a fine performance as Petrucchio, a devil-may-care fortune-hunter who decides to do whatever it takes to marry the wealthy Katharina. He is by turns bawdy, stern and comical, and his deep, sonorous voice and amazing screen presence save the character from becoming a hateful chauvanist - on the contrary, we find ourselves sympathising with Petrucchio at certain points in the film. Taylor, though her part is relatively small, gives a similar performance as Katharina, a manic, violent woman whose intelligence and fermininity eventually overcome her temper and win the favour of her husband. Like Petrucchio, the character of Katharina is, at least on paper, a nightmare of selfishness and bad-tempered outbursts, but it's Taylor's winning performance that gives her depth and sensitivity, and we end up rooting for her. The pair also display an excellent sense of comic timing, and scenes like their wedding, and Petrucchio's chasing Katharina, are lighthearted and enjoyable becuase of it.The supporting cast are also strong, with an excellent performance by Cyril Cusack as Grumpio, Katharina's long-suffering father. Michael York's role is shorter than in the play but he does an admirable job of it nonetheless - dual identity being a favourite theme of Shakespeare's, in this production it's kept somewhat out of the spotlight, wisely, to allow Burton and Taylor to shine through.As with all Zeffirelli's productions, 'Taming' is a visual feast - lush countryside vistas, complicated 16th-century Italian Villas and a succession of ever-more complicated costumes give the viewer the impression that we're watching a dancing rainbow. Zeffirelli's direction, as usual, is top-notch; in particular, the opening scenes where Katharina is raging behind closed doors is excellent.The DVD-transition quality isn't as good as it should have been, but is still very good, and while the DVD won't win any awards for special features, it's still a worthwhile addition to your collection. A fun, lively romp through a relatively simple Shakespeare play, 'The Taming of the Shrew' is a must for Zeffirelli and Taylor fans, but is also a treat for anyone who enjoys intelligent comedy.

Taylor also does incredibly well and the chemistry between them on screen should not be missed by anyone who loves good acting and film history. The color and settings are brilliant. Zefferelli's direction is spot on.The 2nd reason is that this film is one of the better adaptations of Shakespeare to screen ever made.

It is an entirely different animal from Zeferelli's Rome and Juliet, more of a comedy than tragedy, but extraordinarily vivid.  Its underlying psychology, involving the ""disciplining"" of a very difficult adolescent in crisis, is also deeper than Zeferelli's other Shakespeare, with layers that can be discussed.  My father, for example, was a psychiatrist, and he saw it as Petrucio handling a ""borderline"" personality with masterful insight.  My wife and daughter disagreed, highlighting the ""sexist"" aspects of it.  I think it is just fun.Though I had seen it when it came out, I got it for my daughter (16), who is interested in Shakespeare.

335390,A2GVX3VN6XR9OA,6302797616,Roman,"[0, 0]","Franco Zeffirelli directed this 1967 adaptation of the play. This is a well-done and entertaining movie. The colorful costumes, rich decorations, and elaborate set designs definitively help to appreciate the play. However, the addition of a few scenes, particularly the final one, in which Zeffirelli lets Katherine have the last laugh by leaving the banquet without Petruchio, dilutes the overall effect. This act of defiance thus gives a happy ending that implies that Katherine&#8217;s pattern of behavior has not been broken, and that Petruchio has not succeeded. Therefore, those offended by this apparently misogynistic play, could relax and breathe normally.It is obvious that Katharina&#8217;s final speech does not apply to ordinary marriage. If we recognize that Shakespeare uses the terms &#8220;king&#8221; and &#8220;husband&#8221; to denote a spiritual guide, then Katharina&#8217;s speech and the entire play become suddenly pregnant with an entirely different meaning. Katharine describes the guide as lord, keeper, head, and sovereign. The guide is to his disciple as a king is to his subject, and if a disciple proves shrewish, then she, or he, is like a traitor to a loving king. In return, the guide asks only for kindness and true obedience, which represents but tiny payment for &#8220;so great a debt&#8221;. She says that the guide supports and protects mankind, while living a life of hard work and responsibility. The audience may recognize in Katharina&#8217;s speech an echo of King Henry V&#8217;s concerns related to the misunderstanding of a king&#8217;s role and his responsibility.So, the modification to the final scene is an example of how conforming to &#8220;political correctness&#8221; may corrupt the originally intended message. As a wise man said &#8220;there is a limit beyond which it is unhealthy for mankind to conceal truth in order not to offend those whose minds are closed&#8221;.",4,It is unhealthy for mankind to conceal truth in order not to offend those whose minds are closed,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,1930,"['Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'directed', '1967', 'adaptation', 'play', 'well-done', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'rich', 'decorations', 'elaborate', 'set', 'designs', 'definitively', 'help', 'appreciate', 'play', 'However', 'addition', 'few', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'final', 'one', 'Zeffirelli', 'Katherine', 'have', 'last', 'laugh', 'leaving', 'banquet', 'Petruchio', 'overall', 'effect', 'act', 'defiance', 'thus', 'happy', 'ending', 'implies', 'Katherine', '8217', 's', 'pattern', 'behavior', 'not', 'been', 'broken', 'Petruchio', 'not', 'succeeded', 'Therefore', 'offended', 'apparently', 'misogynistic', 'play', 'could', 'relax', 'breathe', 'normally.It', 'obvious', 'Katharina', '8217', 'final', 'speech', 'not', 'apply', 'ordinary', 'marriage', 'recognize', 'Shakespeare', 'terms', '8220', 'king', '8221', '8220', 'husband', '8221', 'denote', 'spiritual', 'guide', 'then', 'Katharina', '8217', 'speech', 'entire', 'play', 'become', 'suddenly', 'pregnant', 'entirely', 'different', 'meaning', 'Katharine', 'guide', 'lord', 'keeper', 'head', 'sovereign', 'guide', 'disciple', 'king', 'subject', 'disciple', 'shrewish', 'then', 'traitor', 'loving', 'king', 'return', 'guide', 'only', 'kindness', 'true', 'obedience', 'tiny', 'payment', '8220', 'so', 'great', 'debt', '8221', 'guide', 'supports', 'protects', 'mankind', 'living', 'life', 'hard', 'work', 'responsibility', 'audience', 'may', 'recognize', 'Katharina', '8217', 'speech', 'echo', 'King', 'Henry', 'V', '8217', 'concerns', 'related', 'misunderstanding', 'king', '8217', 's', 'role', 'responsibility.So', 'modification', 'final', 'scene', 'example', 'how', 'conforming', '8220', 'political', 'correctness', '8221', 'may', 'corrupt', 'originally', 'intended', 'message', 'wise', 'man', 'said', '8220', 'limit', 'unhealthy', 'mankind', 'conceal', 'truth', 'order', 'not', 'offend', 'minds', 'are', 'closed', '8221']",N/A

This movie in no way falls short of the book. If anything, I would say that the movie gets an extra half star because it is here that Shakespeare's Literature meets Zeffirelli's phenomenal images. I think to appreciate this movie as much as possible, we should keep some things Isaac Asimov said in mind: (1. Kate is not simply a shrew. Shakespeare infers that Kate's character is the result of years of social rejection while her sister Bianca had anything she wished. Kate is so scarred that even love appears to be mockery to her. 2. Petruchio DOES NOT delight in his seemingly harsh actions. He feels sympathy for Kate and realizes that it may be the only way to help her. 3. Bianca is NOT a sweet helpless creature. If anything, she is somewhat of a spoiled brat. She is adored by several men; she has managed to monopolize her father's love; she has learned how to manipulate her father; and she delights in her sister's misery.) The movie itself is VERY WELL done. Burton and Taylor have a deep knowledge of the characters they are portraying. Just as Shakespeare's Lucentio is a love struck man who can't see the whole picture about Bianca, this is shown in the movie. One thing I must commend Zeffirelli on is how he is able to portray actions that Shakespeare mentions but does not have acted in the play. (Kate and Petruchio's wedding and Kate's fall into the mud are only mentioned in Shakespeare's play.) In their limited roles, Pedant and Vincentio are hilarious. (Pedant impersonates Vincentio and keeps Vincentio out of his son's house.) Overall, both the major and the secondary characters did an outstanding job. Zeffirelli not only gave us the story, but he added his phenomenal images to it. I once read that &quot;Zeffirelli is often criticized for using phenomenal scenery that detracts from the play.&quot; It is a challange for me to be civil here but I will. 1.Zeffirelli (who also did &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; is one of the most phenomenal directors I have seen. 2. Several recent productions of Shakespeare's plays have used scenery that is not only out of place and garrish, but  almost makes a joke out of the outstanding works of Shakespeare. 3. What is wrong with the meeting of 2 wonderful minds?! With his fascinating images and phenomenal directing skills, Zeffirelli brings Shakespeare's writing to a whole new level of excellence! 4. The people who condemn Zefferelli's work will probably never be satisfied, so their complaints are not worth listening to.

Considered quite a risk to film in late 1966 due to Shakespeare's reputation for serious literary works which possibly lacked alot of mass appeal, this sumptuous film version of one of his best comedies became a surprise hit at the Box Office proving that Shakspeare could be big box office. The film proved an ideal vehicle for screen legends Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton who in the mid 1960's were without a doubt the most famous or ""infamous"", movie couple in the world. Fresh from their triumph in the critically acclaimed ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", for which Elizabeth was destined to win her second Academy Award as Best Actress, ""The Taming of the Shrew"", proved to be an ideal follow up to that more serious earlier effort for the Burtons. Both films were unique in that they gave audiences the impression that what they were actually seeing on screen was very similiar to the much chronicled and very volatile real life marriage of the two colourful super stars. That in itself despite ""Shrews"", many admirable qualities ensured big box office earnings. Whether it did accurately reflect the Burton's real life marriage or not ""The Taming of the Shrew"", is a hugely entertaining romp that stands on its own merits and is a rare film based on a highly intellectual work that can be enjoyed by all viewers with its incredibly rich sets, breath taking costumes and music. Richard Burton and especially Elizabeth Taylor have rarely been better than here and it is sad to think that this film marked the last time where their names together on a film guaranteed its automatic success at the Box Office.",5,Joyous Shakespearian Romp Starring Film Legends Taylor And Burton,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,1803,"['Never', 'having', 'been', 'fan', 'Shakespeare', 'school', 'wonderful', 'film', 'version', 'Bard', 'rollicking', 'comic', 'story', 'was', 'responsible', 'seeing', 'works', 'different', 'light', 'Considered', 'quite', 'risk', 'film', 'late', '1966', 'due', 'Shakespeare', 'reputation', 'serious', 'literary', 'works', 'possibly', 'lacked', 'alot', 'mass', 'appeal', 'sumptuous', 'film', 'version', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'became', 'surprise', 'hit', 'Box', 'Office', 'proving', 'Shakspeare', 'could', 'be', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'film', 'proved', 'ideal', 'vehicle', 'screen', 'legends', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'who', 'mid', '1960', 'were', 'doubt', 'most', 'famous', 'infamous', 'movie', 'couple', 'world', 'Fresh', 'triumph', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'destined', 'win', 'second', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'proved', 'be', 'ideal', 'follow', 'up', 'more', 'serious', 'earlier', 'effort', 'Burtons', 'films', 'were', 'unique', 'gave', 'audiences', 'impression', 'what', 'were', 'actually', 'seeing', 'screen', 'was', 'very', 'similiar', 'much', 'chronicled', 'very', 'volatile', 'real', 'life', 'marriage', 'two', 'colourful', 'super', 'stars', 'Shrews', 'many', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'ensured', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'earnings', 'did', 'accurately', 'reflect', 'Burton', 'real', 'life', 'marriage', 'not', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'romp', 'own', 'merits', 'rare', 'film', 'based', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'work', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'viewers', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'sets', 'breath', 'taking', 'costumes', 'music', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'especially', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'have', 'rarely', 'been', 'better', 'here', 'sad', 'think', 'film', 'marked', 'last', 'time', 'where', 'names', 'together', 'film', 'guaranteed', 'automatic', 'success', 'Box', 'Office']",N/A
335400,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,6302797616,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[12, 14]","+++++This movie is based on William Shakespeare's play, the romantic comedy ""The Taming of the Shrew"" (written circa 1590).The movie and play only have five major characters:(1) Baptista Monola (Michael Hordern): a rich gentleman of Padua.  He insists that his elder daughter (a shrew or what we today call a ""bitch"") marry before his younger daughter does.(2) Katharina (Elizabeth Taylor): his beautiful, elder daughter, ""as brown as hue as hazel nuts,"" whose ""only fault, and that is faults enough, is that she is intolerable curst and shrewd and forward.""  She is also called KATE.(3) Bianca (Natasha Pyne, her movie debut): her younger sister, as modest and gentle as Kate is wild and unruly.  She has a few suitors after her.(4) Petruchio (Richard Burton): ""a mad-brain rudesby"" and a ""swearing Jack,"" yet a gentleman of Verona, resolved to ""tame"" Kate.  (It's this taming that makes the play and movie politically incorrect today.)  He has two servants.(5) Lucentio (Michael York, his movie debut): a young man, ""a proper stripling an amorous,"" in love with Bianca.  He has two servants.To appreciate this movie fully, you must realize that Elizabeth Taylor and the late Richard Burton were ever-quarrelling lovers (just as Kate and Petruchio are) in real life in the 1960s with their on-again, off-again marriage.  Thus, some say that these were the best movie roles of these two great actors.These two lovers play out their own love affair in period costumes, and we're never allowed to forget that we're watching a movie with two famous stars (just as in the original play we are never allowed to forget that Kate and Petruchio are playing a part).Director Franco Zeffirelli has cut some stuff found in the original play but to compensate, he provides more physical action thus making this comedy more accessible to the modern movie watcher.  As well, he has left intact the boisterous vitality of the play and most of its poetry.Despite its raucous energy, this movie is tame and non-controversial but still sexy with lots of broken crockery and high-spirited taming.  There's no hint of the underlying cruelty that makes the play so controversial today.This movie lacks intellectual bite but it's a flamboyant spectacle that makes few demands on the viewer.  Since Shakespeare wanted to appeal to public taste, this movie probably comes closest to his own intention.The speech uttered is brilliantly alive by all actors (especially by Burton and Taylor).  Costumes are dazzling.  The actual location shots add realism.  The cinematography is beautiful.  The background music adds to each scene.The DVD itself is flawless in picture and sound quality.  It has minimal extras.BOTTOM LINE:This is a worthy addition to the Bard's cinematic canon.(1967;  2 hr;  widescreen;  28 scenes)+++++",5,Spectacularly entertaining movie based on Shakespeare's politically incorrect play,1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,2796,"['+++++This', 'movie', 'based', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'written', 'circa', '1590', '.The', 'movie', 'play', 'only', 'have', 'five', 'major', 'characters', '1', 'Baptista', 'Monola', 'Michael', 'Hordern', 'rich', 'gentleman', 'Padua', 'elder', 'daughter', 'shrew', 'what', 'today', 'call', 'bitch', 'marry', 'younger', 'daughter', '2', 'Katharina', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'beautiful', 'elder', 'daughter', 'as', 'brown', 'as', 'hue', 'hazel', 'nuts', 'only', 'fault', 'faults', 'enough', 'intolerable', 'curst', 'shrewd', 'forward', 'also', 'called', 'KATE', '3', 'Bianca', 'Natasha', 'Pyne', 'movie', 'debut', 'younger', 'sister', 'modest', 'gentle', 'Kate', 'wild', 'unruly', 'few', 'suitors', '4', 'Petruchio', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'mad-brain', 'rudesby', 'swearing', 'Jack', 'yet', 'gentleman', 'Verona', 'resolved', 'tame', 'Kate', 'taming', 'play', 'movie', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'today', 'two', 'servants', '5', 'Lucentio', 'Michael', 'York', 'movie', 'debut', 'young', 'man', 'proper', 'stripling', 'amorous', 'love', 'Bianca', 'two', 'servants.To', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'fully', 'must', 'realize', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'late', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'were', 'ever-quarrelling', 'lovers', 'just', 'Kate', 'Petruchio', 'are', 'real', 'life', '1960s', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'marriage', 'Thus', 'say', 'were', 'best', 'movie', 'roles', 'two', 'great', 'actors.These', 'two', 'lovers', 'play', 'out', 'own', 'love', 'affair', 'period', 'costumes', ""'re"", 'never', 'allowed', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'two', 'famous', 'stars', 'just', 'original', 'play', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'forget', 'Kate', 'Petruchio', 'are', 'playing', 'part', '.Director', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'cut', 'stuff', 'found', 'original', 'play', 'compensate', 'more', 'physical', 'action', 'thus', 'making', 'comedy', 'more', 'accessible', 'modern', 'movie', 'watcher', 'well', 'left', 'intact', 'boisterous', 'vitality', 'play', 'most', 'poetry.Despite', 'raucous', 'energy', 'movie', 'tame', 'non-controversial', 'still', 'sexy', 'lots', 'broken', 'crockery', 'high-spirited', 'taming', 'hint', 'underlying', 'cruelty', 'play', 'so', 'controversial', 'today.This', 'movie', 'intellectual', 'bite', 'flamboyant', 'spectacle', 'few', 'demands', 'viewer', 'Shakespeare', 'wanted', 'appeal', 'public', 'taste', 'movie', 'probably', 'closest', 'own', 'intention.The', 'speech', 'uttered', 'brilliantly', 'alive', 'actors', 'especially', 'Burton', 'Taylor', 'Costumes', 'are', 'dazzling', 'actual', 'location', 'shots', 'add', 'realism', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'background', 'music', 'scene.The', 'DVD', 'flawless', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'minimal', 'extras.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Bard', 'cinematic', 'canon', '1967', '2', 'hr', '28', 'scenes', '+++++']",N/A

I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if about a month ago I hadn't happened to have been reading some books on abusive men and their distorted perceptions of female realities.  I know that Taylor & Burton are playing caricatures.  The problem is, there is truth in caricatures.  For some reason it is supposed to be funny when the man chases his hoped for bride, does a full body restraint on her, painfully twists her arm, makes what are essentially sexually harrassing remarks, acts like a fool on the wedding day and tricks her into being married, then keeps her from eating on her wedding night after an exhausting trip, rips up a dress she had her heart set on after he tempts her with it, and on and on.Of course it is understood (as in the minds of abusive men and their, uh, ""literature"") that the woman really likes the rough and humilating treatment she is getting.  It is also understood that while the woman's behavior means ""she had it comin'"" and warrants her being treated like property (which is exactly how Shakespeare has the new husband talk about his wife), the man's bufoonish, violent, alcoholic behaviors get no disapproval from anyone.I just recently watched a John Wayne movie, McLintock.  It seemed to me it might have been based on the Taming of the Shrew, which is why I have watched this movie.  I was right.  Same drunken loutish man who never improves in any way.  Same shrewish woman who turns into a lamb after her husband abuses and humiliates her enough.I give thanks to Heaven that we are told in Scriptures, ""Be considerate of your wives or your prayers will not be answered"" and that some men actually treat His daughters with love and respect.The Taming of the Shrew is not a comedy to me, and I suspect to legions of women who have been ""thus treated.""

Then I read the reviews and realized that many if not most are simply blinded by fandom.  Their love of the idea behind the legendary stars and their romance- Liz Taylor and Burton, has made it so that these two can do no wrong in their eyes.  In reality this film is just ok.  The acting is also just ok.  (Although Burton does a better job than Taylor) I felt the director did a very good job though.This play can be difficult to swallow for many especially in this day and age.  We watch Katarina change from a nutcase but one who is opinionated and strong-willed.  To a &#34;lady&#34; but one that has no opinions or thoughts of her own.  She simply becomes a parrot and takes on the thoughts, feelings and opinions of her husband's in place of her own.  Her final speech has been known to derive laughter from some audiences when she states that for the &#34;love&#34; a husband gives a wife the &#34;only&#34; thing he asks for in return is that she always remain beautiful, always be obedient to him and always be soft and sweet.  Which she insists is a small price to pay.  It is important to remember that in his day plays were all written by men, performed solely by men, and presented in front of mostly a male audience.  Throughout his plays the female characters often seem to have the strange need to remind others in their speeches that they are female (as if the person they were speaking to couldn't tell they were female just by looking at them).
