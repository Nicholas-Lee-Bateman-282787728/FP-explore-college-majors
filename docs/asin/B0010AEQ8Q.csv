I thought I had seen the bottom of the barrel with SLAUGHTERED, but this one is even worse.  Filmed by wanna-be amatuers, it looks like something a seventh-grader put together on a lonely week-end.  Thank god DVD players come with a FAST FORWARD feature. Even then, my eyes hurt from watching this dreck.  Total and complete TRASH.  Don't even waste your time looking at this movie on AMAZON.  Go on to something else.  I would rather be forced to watch BARNEY THE DINOSAUR while drinking acid tainted Kool-Aid rather than sit thru this cinamatic garbage dump.  I gave it one star because you can't give no stars or even negative stars.  Forget about this one.

This is literally the quintessential 'movie' that all horror fans dread renting (much less buying). An utterly worthless and incredibly boring shot on OLD VHS camcorder home movie! There isn't even anything to laugh at in this thing to give it some sort of enjoyable cheesy appeal. We're talking the SINGLE MOST BORING 'MOVIE' I'VE EVER SEEN!!!

I mean ANYBODY with a cam-corder and $100.00 can make a movie as good as this. The actors are most likely hang out buddies of the director. One woman would be a very good candidate for the TV show the biggest loser especially in the lower back side ( If you know what I mean?) The blood looked fake. The music was horrible. Also, hardly anyone drives a car in this movie. Everyone walks long distances to get where they are going while the horrible music is playing. One guy takes about 10 minutes of movie time to walk from his house to see his girlfriends house. Walking across large open fields, through woods, down narrow roads ect.... it goes on and on and on before he ever gtes to his girl friends house. Then when he gets there they have an argument about a minute after he arrives. The director is also the main star in the film. I don't know which is worse. His acting or his movie. The only good this DVD will give me is I hope I can trade it in at my local video store.
