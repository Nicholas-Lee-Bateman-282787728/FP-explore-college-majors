No, I would  not give the Saw movies all 5 stars either.  This movie was not focused around the gore, but rather the details picked up from the characters.  Saw, House of 9, and Nine Dead all have similar qualities, but I really enjoyed this one and found a nice treat in it as a fan of LOST.The movie was made fairly well.  Melissa Joan Hart is catty and annoying as she is in most of her roles, but the supporting roles did a wonderful job.  I went into the movie thinking I would be fairly lame and a copy of Saw, but I was surprised and actually enjoyed it.  I would watch it again just to pick up on what I missed.

So does the first few minutes of this low budget movie, showing nine blindfolded persons being brought into a decrepit industrial room and handcuffed by a masked gunman. As it unfolds, though, Nine Dead turns out to be a surprisingly good, engaging and even intelligent drama. The gunman tells the nine seemingly disparate people (among them a policeman, a district attorney, a nightclub owner, a priest, a street burglar, a pedophile who has served time in jail and a man who works for an insurance company) that he will come into the room every ten minutes and kill one of them until they tell him the reason he has brought them there. As the movie unfolds, and more and more people get killed by the gunman, the survivors realized they are all connected through the gripping case of an innocent man whose life was destroyed by them. The movie stays away from the gore and the torture (beyond the necessary) and goes for an intelligent plot. It is also fairly well acted, mostly by unknowns to me, except Melissa Joan Hart in a good turn as a district attorney who turns out to be the most amoral person in the movie.",4,Better than expected,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,1179,"['poster', 'cheap', 'knock', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'So', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'showing', 'nine', 'blindfolded', 'persons', 'being', 'brought', 'decrepit', 'industrial', 'room', 'handcuffed', 'masked', 'gunman', 'though', 'Nine', 'Dead', 'out', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'engaging', 'even', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'gunman', 'nine', 'seemingly', 'disparate', 'people', 'policeman', 'district', 'attorney', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'priest', 'street', 'burglar', 'pedophile', 'who', 'served', 'time', 'jail', 'man', 'who', 'insurance', 'company', 'will', 'come', 'room', 'ten', 'minutes', 'kill', 'one', 'tell', 'reason', 'brought', 'there', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'gunman', 'survivors', 'realized', 'are', 'connected', 'gripping', 'case', 'innocent', 'man', 'life', 'was', 'destroyed', 'movie', 'away', 'gore', 'torture', 'necessary', 'intelligent', 'plot', 'also', 'fairly', 'well', 'acted', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'good', 'turn', 'district', 'attorney', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'amoral', 'person', 'movie']",N/A

1316837,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B00316DDUY,Compay,"[9, 10]","The best part about Nine Dead is that it keeps you in suspense.  The downside?  It's been done before in the 2007 film Fermat's Room.The story is centered around nine strangers who have been kidnapped and handcuffed in a room.  Every 10 minutes, their kidnapper will kill one of them, until they realize what they all have in common.  Their situation is also complicated by the fact that one of the nine strangers doesn't speak English.The biggest problem I have with the film is that the film's concept has already been tackled by several movies, including La Habitaci&oacute;n de Fermat.  In Fermat's Room, four strangers are trapped in a shrinking room that will crush them to death, unless they can discover what they all have in common.The majority of the cast has worked primarily in television, and there's nothing particularly special about the cinematography.  While the film was suspenseful, the film's open-ended conclusion will disappoint many viewers.  Not to mention that it was virtually impossible for the kidnapper to know how many of the strangers were connected.  Even though I'm straight, I thought the director's choice of which character just so happened to be a pedophile was an unnecessary stereotype and in awful taste.Overall, the movie is worth a buck to watch through Redbox.

However, the film is very suspenseful and builds up quite nicely.  However, I agree with just about all of the other reviewers in that the ending came out of nowhere.

1316840,ARYPK3ZRXTGWB,B00316DDUY,"J.N. ""Fat Loser""","[1, 1]","SPOILER ALERT!  There's been some negative reviews concerning Melissa Joan Hart's acting and the film's lack of originality, but I have to disagree.  I think Melissa Joan Hart did fine in this movie despite the cheesy dialogue she had to regurgitate.  And this may have been a low budget b-movie but it was actually quite interesting and very watchable.  My biggest complaint and why I only gave the film three stars is the ""Killer's"" uneven motive.  I mean I can understand why he would want revenge against the people who have wronged him.  But quite frankly, some of the nine people he kidnapped are barely guilty.  The poor Chinese lady only misidentified someone.  She's an aging, immigrant who was pistol whipped during a store robbery and pointed out the wrong person in a line up.  Who can blame her?  And the insurance agent was just following protocol when denying a claim to someone with a criminal record, there was no malice or evil intent.  So I couldn't really empathize with the killer when he chose them as part of the nine to die.  The stereotypical, street tough, gun selling thug and the obnoxious, Nicholas Cage-like, mafia, strip club owner were also only incidentally guilty BUT I didn't mind seeing them get killed because they were such unlikable characters.  The others in the group like the petty thief, dopey priest and sucky cop were also unsavory jerks but not directly involved in any wrong doing.  So their deaths did not bring much satisfaction.  I think it would have made a stronger impact if these people were a tad more loathsome and directly responsible in wronging the killer.  Strangely, the two characters who were the MOST guilty got off kind of light.  The lisping, gay, prison rapist with AIDS is probably the most guilty person in the film so I was surprised that the Killer just shoots him.  I mean it would have made more sense if the Killer had punished him in a more ironic fashion like some elaborate, drawn out, suffering, torture killing like in the SAW films.  And strangely, the second most guilty party, the assistant district attorney, escapes.  Well that made for a very unsatisfying ending on a somewhat decent film.  Actually, there was no ending.  The film runs out and the credits start rolling.

1316844,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00316DDUY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","A masked gunman is going around town adbucting people.  Citizens are concerned, the police are puzzled, and just for fun Daniel Baldwin gets tazzered in his cameo appearance.  Then we see nine hood figures in a room, bound to poles by pairs of handcuffs.  The masked man appears and removes their hoods.  He explains that the nine of them are there for a reason and until they can figure out the connection, he will return every ten minutes and kill one of them.  To help them solve the puzzle he dumps a bunch of chalk on the floor and on his way out the door he releases one set of handcuffs so they can chalk their own Cliffs Notes on the wall.  There is even a miniature ""Lost""-like clock to countdown the ten minutes, and that is how the game is played in ""Nine Dead.""There are a few familiar faces in the crowd, withMelissa Joan Hartas Kelley, making Sabrina the Teenage Witch a tiny speck in her rear view mirror, the most prominent.  You should also recognize William Lee Scott from ""The Butterfly Effect"" and John Terry from ""Lost.""  Then there is Lucille Soong, whom you will recognize and probably not be able to name (I could not), whose character is an interesting wild card because she does not speak English.  You will suspect early on that the more familiar the face, the higher more likely a character is to survive longer as the film tries to make good on its title.  When you consider that over 90% of the film is shot in one room by characters with only one hand not handcuffed to a pole, first time director Chris Shadley (whose resume includes being a video assistant on such films as ""Bug"" and ""The Midnight Meat Train""), does a copetent job.  After all, we're talking about a series of talking heads and limited opportunities to frame shots.  Overall, the acting is better than you get in most horror films, mainly because the characters are actually given an opportunity to dissect their lives looking for clues, which is way beyond the standard dialogue requirements of a slasher flick.  But as their numbers dwell to a meager few and the tension ratchets up a bit, the anxiety and compusre levels do not escelate accordingly.  Or maybe it is just that the masked man saved the most stable members of his private collection for last.The obvious referent point for this direct to DVD offering is the ""Saw"" franchise, but more ""Saw II"" than any of the others because of the group dynamic.  But it is that dynamic that actually had me thinking more along the lines of both ""12 Angry Men,"" the classic film about group deliveration, and the work of Agatha Christie, as in ""And Then There Were None"" by way of ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" although this summer the point of reference might be the ""Persons Unknown"" mini-series.  What matters is the reason why these people were brought together, so it is much more of a mystery movie than a splatter flick.  Certainly the blood and gore in ""Nine Dead"" is nowhere near the torture-porn level, and if you are expecting to see a gruesome death every 10 minutes, you are going to be disappointed.  There is something refreshing of a horror film that is trying to get you to listen and think as oppose to just trying to gross you out.""Nine Dead"" is also unusual because the sense of identification with the victims is not as strong.  Traditionally you are dealing with innocent victims, but here, as with ""Saw,"" there is some method to the madness.  Besides, you really are focused more on why they are there than on what is happening to them, but do not be fooled into thinking that you can play along and get to the answer before the group members dwindle down to zero.  This is a watch and learn type of mystery.  The ending is problematic, because when you find out why everybody is there you are not exactly blown away, so by the Agatha Christie standard there is not the big revelation to impress the hell out of you.  Granted, those are hard to come by these days, but it remains the primary requirement to make a film like ""Nine Dead"" really succeed and where it loses another star.  Even by the ""Saw"" standard, the ""twist"" at the end is hardly as memorable as the corpse getting up and walking away and the final shot is arguably adding insult to injury by leaving us with ""That's it?"" instead of ""That's it!""",3,"An interesting premise, but the payoff is just not good enough",1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,4286,"['masked', 'gunman', 'going', 'around', 'town', 'adbucting', 'people', 'Citizens', 'are', 'concerned', 'police', 'are', 'puzzled', 'just', 'fun', 'Daniel', 'Baldwin', 'tazzered', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Then', 'see', 'nine', 'hood', 'figures', 'room', 'bound', 'poles', 'pairs', 'handcuffs', 'masked', 'man', 'hoods', 'nine', 'are', 'there', 'reason', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'connection', 'will', 'return', 'ten', 'minutes', 'kill', 'one', 'help', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'bunch', 'chalk', 'floor', 'way', 'door', 'one', 'set', 'handcuffs', 'can', 'chalk', 'own', 'Cliffs', 'Notes', 'wall', 'even', 'miniature', 'Lost', '-like', 'clock', 'countdown', 'ten', 'minutes', 'how', 'game', 'played', 'Nine', 'Dead', 'are', 'few', 'familiar', 'crowd', 'withMelissa', 'Joan', 'Hartas', 'Kelley', 'making', 'Sabrina', 'Teenage', 'Witch', 'tiny', 'speck', 'rear', 'view', 'mirror', 'most', 'prominent', 'should', 'also', 'recognize', 'William', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'John', 'Terry', 'Lost', 'Then', 'Lucille', 'Soong', 'whom', 'will', 'recognize', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'name', 'could', 'not', 'character', 'interesting', 'wild', 'card', 'not', 'speak', 'English', 'will', 'suspect', 'early', 'more', 'familiar', 'face', 'higher', 'more', 'likely', 'character', 'survive', 'longer', 'film', 'make', 'good', 'title', 'When', 'consider', '90', '%', 'film', 'shot', 'one', 'room', 'characters', 'only', 'one', 'hand', 'not', 'handcuffed', 'pole', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Chris', 'Shadley', 'resume', 'being', 'video', 'assistant', 'such', 'films', 'Bug', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'copetent', 'job', ""'re"", 'talking', 'series', 'talking', 'heads', 'limited', 'opportunities', 'frame', 'shots', 'Overall', 'acting', 'better', 'get', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'mainly', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'given', 'opportunity', 'dissect', 'lives', 'looking', 'clues', 'way', 'standard', 'dialogue', 'requirements', 'slasher', 'flick', 'numbers', 'dwell', 'meager', 'few', 'tension', 'up', 'bit', 'anxiety', 'compusre', 'levels', 'do', 'not', 'escelate', 'accordingly', 'maybe', 'just', 'masked', 'man', 'saved', 'most', 'stable', 'members', 'private', 'collection', 'last.The', 'obvious', 'referent', 'point', 'direct', 'DVD', 'offering', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'more', 'Saw', 'II', 'others', 'group', 'dynamic', 'dynamic', 'actually', 'had', 'thinking', 'more', 'lines', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', 'classic', 'film', 'group', 'deliveration', 'work', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Then', 'Were', 'None', 'way', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'summer', 'point', 'reference', 'might', 'be', 'Persons', 'Unknown', 'mini-series', 'What', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'were', 'brought', 'together', 'much', 'more', 'mystery', 'movie', 'splatter', 'flick', 'Certainly', 'blood', 'gore', 'Nine', 'Dead', 'nowhere', 'torture-porn', 'level', 'are', 'expecting', 'see', 'gruesome', 'death', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'something', 'refreshing', 'horror', 'film', 'trying', 'get', 'listen', 'think', 'oppose', 'just', 'trying', 'gross', 'out', 'Nine', 'Dead', 'also', 'unusual', 'sense', 'identification', 'victims', 'not', 'strong', 'Traditionally', 'are', 'dealing', 'innocent', 'victims', 'here', 'Saw', 'method', 'madness', 'really', 'are', 'focused', 'more', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'what', 'happening', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'can', 'play', 'along', 'get', 'answer', 'group', 'members', 'dwindle', 'zero', 'watch', 'learn', 'type', 'mystery', 'ending', 'problematic', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'everybody', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'blown', 'away', 'so', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'standard', 'not', 'big', 'revelation', 'impress', 'hell', 'Granted', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'days', 'primary', 'requirement', 'make', 'film', 'Nine', 'Dead', 'really', 'succeed', 'where', 'star', 'Even', 'Saw', 'standard', 'twist', 'end', 'hardly', 'as', 'memorable', 'corpse', 'getting', 'up', 'walking', 'away', 'final', 'shot', 'arguably', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'leaving', 'instead']",N/A

Someone dies every 10 minutes unless they can figure out why they are all there and how they are connected...A lot of potential for bad here, and it begins by showing several annoying characters being kidnapped so it's hard to find sympathy for them.At first, the acting seems very over-the top and almost parody-like, like they are possibly portraying stereotypes, but when they start to actually figure out how each of them are connected, it becomes suspenseful and draws you in. I was very surprised when I stopped being annoyed and impatient...The main drawback here is the ending; it's what you wouldn't expect and does not end happily OR unhappily depending on how you look at it...Also, the characters are very unlikeable for the most part, with the priest and the lawyer ranking up there with infuriating...The other thing that didn't add up was that 2 of the characters knew each other but don't admit to it - which really seems like a far-shot to connect things in the end...Overall, when it was over, our reaction was still surprise that it managed to be better than 70% of random direct to DVD horror films - not easy to do these days.Worth renting, but I don't see any re-watch value.",4,Surprisingly Worth Watching -Suspenseful,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,1424,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'movie-', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'Drive', 'Me', 'Crazy', 'Sabrina', 'Teenage', 'Witch.From', 'description', 'back', 'Saw', 'knockoff.9', 'people', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'put', 'room', 'together', 'Someone', '10', 'minutes', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'how', 'are', 'connected', 'lot', 'potential', 'bad', 'here', 'showing', 'several', 'annoying', 'characters', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'hard', 'find', 'sympathy', 'them.At', 'first', 'acting', 'very', 'over-the', 'top', 'almost', 'parody-like', 'are', 'possibly', 'portraying', 'stereotypes', 'when', 'start', 'actually', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'are', 'connected', 'suspenseful', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'when', 'stopped', 'being', 'annoyed', 'impatient', 'main', 'drawback', 'here', 'ending', 'what', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'not', 'end', 'happily', 'OR', 'unhappily', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'Also', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'most', 'part', 'priest', 'lawyer', 'ranking', 'up', 'there', 'infuriating', 'other', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'was', '2', 'characters', 'knew', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'admit', 'really', 'far-shot', 'connect', 'things', 'end', 'Overall', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'reaction', 'was', 'still', 'managed', 'be', 'better', '70', '%', 'random', 'direct', 'DVD', 'horror', 'films', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'days.Worth', 'renting', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 're-watch', 'value']",N/A

Surprisingly, this one was executed in a way I haven't seen done prior, but it all ultimately goes back to putting strangers in a room.**Rant about Melissa Joan Hart's acting**Despite what I said in my other reviews where I might've mentioned that someone might've been the worst actor I've ever seen, Melissa Joan Hart in this movie takes the cake. I don't know if she's just not good in portraying the emotion of fear, but her acting singlehandedly kept me intrigued and glued. It was a guilty pleasure, very rarely do I get to see someone perform so badly at their craft. Her facial expressions were RIDICULOUS. She gestures and contorts her eyes, mouth, and particularly her EYEBROWS in unnecessary, cartoon-like ways. She puts the wrong emphasis on the words she's speaking, and delivers every line 'Nickelodeon style,' as if she's ""giving it her all"" on each line so you don't miss anything. Complete overacting, no nuance or subtlety. I haven't seen her in other movies, so I won't flat out say she's the worst actor ever, but this was the worst PERFORMANCE I've seen.**Problems with the movie**The story within the story was actually pretty decent and competently written, but the movie itself reeks of amateurishness. No wonder the writer of the script has this movie as his only credit for work he's done. I'm going to bookmark his IMDb page and periodically check to see if he does anything else, I'd surprised if he does. The story of how they were all connected to each other and how it relates to the masked kidnapper was intricately woven. That part was fine, it was the dialogue and the acting that killed this movie.Here's the most infuriating thing- So the kidnapper comes in every 10 minutes to kill someone if they haven't figured out why each of them are being held captive right? Well, every time he comes in and chooses the person to kill, he gives them one last chance to explain why they're there, and if they get it right, he'd let them all go. All that these characters did was just try to reason by saying things like, ""we need more time to figure it out."" Don't you think you'd be speaking a hundred miles per hour on all the atrocities you might've done in your life and hope you guess right??? I'm sure anyone can imagine if they were in such a situation, you'd be nervously stumbling and stammering over words, but to not even so much as venture a GUESS is ridiculous. And yes, I realize the rules the kidnapper layed out was that each victim, upon their turn, had to not only guess why he or she was there, but why *everyone else was there as well. I have two counters to this:1) When your life is on the line, and you think you have something to offer the killer as to what he's looking for, are you going to play by the rules? So what that you didn't meet the second qualification of knowing why the others were there, would you not tell this guy what ""evil"" things you think YOU might've done and hope you guess right? Clearly EACH person had a good idea of why they themselves were there, it was clear through the dialogue.2) Even if you don't agree with my opinion above, then how about when there came a time in the movie where the characters more or less had the whole damn chain of events of the puzzle solved, with just a few missing pieces (at that point they still didn't figure out how the medical dude fit into the story). So they have 90% of it figured out, the killer comes in, and not ONE PERSON EVEN TRIES TO SELL HIM ON THEIR THEORY. The idiot cop just said something about, ""we have most of it figured out, we need more time."" WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM WHAT YOU KNOW SO FAR YOU MORONIC IMBECILE. What, do you think he's going to prematurely kill you if you get the story wrong? And going even deeper into my abyss of madness (i.e., logic), I could sort of even understand why the other people who's turn hadn't come yet wouldn't say anything, so as to not bring attention to themselves by offering the solution (and potentially getting it wrong, and yeah, maybe being killed for it), But, if it's YOUR turn to die, and the killer is in your face, giving you one last guess to solve the puzzle, WHY WOULD YOU NOT TELL HIM WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW SO FAR??????????? Patrick Wehe Mahoney is probably the dumbest person on the planet. He's the writer..Another stupid part:Melissa Joan Hart said something about how a jury wouldn't rely on the testimony of a ""60 year old woman."" OMG, 60!! She's practically a dinosaur right? There's no way a 60 year old can remember something. Right...is this writer like 15 years old?

1316851,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00316DDUY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","&lt;strong>Nine Dead&lt;/strong> (Chris Shadley, 2010)First off: casting Melissa Joan Hart as the lead in any movie containing a character who is an admitted pedophile, and then not having one single &lt;em>Clarissa Explains It All&lt;/em> reference, is an abomination, a crime against humanity, and I expect filmmakers to take this into account in the future.Okay, that aside, &lt;em>Nine Dead&lt;/em> is a surprisingly capable locked-room thriller with a twist ending that will probably make you wince, but is still worth watching nonetheless. The premise, as it usually is in locked-room thrillers, is simple: nine people are kidnapped by a blue-masked assailant and locked in a concrete room, each shackled to the wall. Once they have all been assembled, the masked assailant comes in and tells them they have ten minutes to figure out why they're all there. At the end of the first ten minutes, one of them will die, after which the clock will begin again. As you may surmise, the rest of the movie is rather talky, as the nine (then eight, then seven...) of them try to figure out the commonality that brought them to this point.That synopsis should tell you two things: first, that the quality of this movie (as the quality of most locked-room thrillers) is directly based on the quality of the cast who are going to be doing all that talking, and second, that this is going to be, for a thriller, a pretty slow movie. Both of those things are absolutely true, and the latter is one of the reasons this movie has attracted so much derision from the horror-heads. Yes, the body count is quite low for a modern thriller, and yes, while there is some gore, there's not much of it. Which should have actually helped the film find a wider audience, given the quality and diversity of the cast, which brings us back to point number one. Hart leads here, as she probably should, and she's backed up by William Lee Scott (&lt;em>October Sky&lt;/em>), John Terry (&lt;em>Full Metal Jacket&lt;/em>), James Victor (&lt;em>Executive Decision&lt;/em>), Mark Macaulay (&lt;em>Monster&lt;/em>), Lucille Soong (&lt;em>Sky High&lt;/em>), Chip Bent (&lt;em>Closure&lt;/em>), Edrick Brown (&lt;em>Drive Angry&lt;/em>), Andrew Sensenig (&lt;em>I Love You Philip Morris&lt;/em>), and Lawrence Turner (&lt;em>Red&lt;/em>). Not a bad little cast there, and a number of them bring their A games. Turner's pedophile is creepy as all get-out, and that's a good hook into the rest of these characters; while they're not overly deep, for the most part (there's some interesting backstory between two of them that ultimately ends up affecting the storyline), the actors give us convincing portrayals of the characters they're playing, which helps this movie move along nicely.I'll admit to some bias here in that I'm a fan of this sort of locked-room thriller and seek them out, and also that I've been a longtime fan of Melissa Joan Hart's, but I liked this one a lot more than seemingly everyone else who's ever reviewed it. Worth checking out of you like locked-room thrillers, and maybe even if you don't. *** ",4,"Sharp, capable locked room thriller.",1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,3092,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Nine', 'Dead', 'lt', '>', 'Chris', 'Shadley', '2010', 'First', 'casting', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'lead', 'movie', 'containing', 'character', 'who', 'admitted', 'pedophile', 'then', 'not', 'having', 'one', 'single', 'lt', '>', 'Clarissa', 'Explains', 'All', 'lt', '>', 'reference', 'abomination', 'crime', 'humanity', 'expect', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'account', 'future.Okay', 'aside', 'lt', '>', 'Nine', 'Dead', 'lt', '>', 'surprisingly', 'capable', 'locked-room', 'thriller', 'twist', 'ending', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'wince', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'nonetheless', 'premise', 'usually', 'locked-room', 'thrillers', 'simple', 'nine', 'people', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'blue-masked', 'assailant', 'locked', 'concrete', 'room', 'shackled', 'wall', 'have', 'been', 'assembled', 'masked', 'assailant', 'tells', 'have', 'ten', 'minutes', 'figure', 'out', 'why', ""'re"", 'there', 'end', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'one', 'will', 'die', 'clock', 'will', 'begin', 'again', 'may', 'surmise', 'rest', 'movie', 'rather', 'talky', 'nine', 'then', 'eight', 'then', 'seven', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'commonality', 'brought', 'point.That', 'synopsis', 'should', 'tell', 'two', 'things', 'first', 'quality', 'movie', 'quality', 'most', 'locked-room', 'thrillers', 'directly', 'based', 'quality', 'cast', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'doing', 'talking', 'second', 'going', 'be', 'thriller', 'pretty', 'slow', 'movie', 'things', 'are', 'absolutely', 'true', 'latter', 'one', 'reasons', 'movie', 'attracted', 'so', 'much', 'derision', 'horror-heads', 'Yes', 'body', 'count', 'quite', 'low', 'modern', 'thriller', 'yes', 'gore', 'not', 'much', 'Which', 'should', 'have', 'actually', 'helped', 'film', 'find', 'wider', 'audience', 'given', 'quality', 'diversity', 'cast', 'back', 'point', 'number', 'one', 'Hart', 'here', 'probably', 'should', 'backed', 'up', 'William', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'lt', 'October', 'Sky', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'John', 'Terry', 'lt', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'James', 'Victor', 'lt', '>', 'Executive', 'Decision', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Mark', 'Macaulay', 'lt', '>', 'Monster', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Lucille', 'Soong', 'lt', '>', 'Sky', 'High', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Chip', 'Bent', 'lt', '>', 'Closure', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Edrick', 'Brown', 'lt', '>', 'Drive', 'Angry', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Andrew', 'Sensenig', 'lt', '>', 'Love', 'Philip', 'Morris', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Lawrence', 'Turner', 'lt', '>', 'Red', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Not', 'bad', 'little', 'cast', 'there', 'number', 'bring', 'games', 'Turner', 'pedophile', 'creepy', 'get-out', 'good', 'hook', 'rest', 'characters', ""'re"", 'not', 'overly', 'deep', 'most', 'part', 'interesting', 'backstory', 'two', 'ultimately', 'up', 'affecting', 'storyline', 'actors', 'give', 'convincing', 'portrayals', 'characters', ""'re"", 'playing', 'movie', 'move', 'nicely.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'bias', 'here', ""'m"", 'fan', 'sort', 'locked-room', 'thriller', 'seek', 'out', 'also', ""'ve"", 'been', 'longtime', 'fan', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'liked', 'one', 'lot', 'more', 'seemingly', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'ever', 'reviewed', 'checking', 'locked-room', 'thrillers', 'maybe', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", '***']",N/A

Frankly, while watching this I thought it would be fantastic done guignol on a stage.  The plot is something that can't be explored very much without chancing spoliers, suffice it to say that a group of people are kidnapped seemingly at random and chained up in a basement and given time to figure out why they are all there together.  However, at 10 minute intervals one of the people is killed. As the film progresses, various stock characters- female lawyer, skeezy strip joint owner, conflicted clergy- begin to confess to each other in an effort to survive.  I feel like I had just watched a Christian film- that no one in the room realized that their sins had far reaching complications and in order for them to survive they had to acknowledge this and confess it to a Father Figure who had lost his son to their sins.  I would recommend this to Christian friends who like horror films.

1316854,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B00316DDUY,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 0]","The plot of this one is pretty simple. Nine strangers find themselves locked in a room by a masked gunman. Every 10 minutes one of them dies unless they all find out why they were brought together. The idea, not so original. Other reviewers have mentioned other films, but the Saw series comes immediately to mind for me. But even looking past that, this film still had the potential to be pretty decent. First off, if you're thinking that you're gonna get any of the gore, blood, or torture that the Saw films have, you will be sadly disappointed. The violence and blood are minimal. This a suspense/thriller type film, not horror. Again, the concept isn't bad, but script and execution of the story itself and how all the characters were ""connected"" to each other doesn't really add up. Without going into detail and potentially spoiling the film for others, there was just some things that the killer simply would have or could have never found out about the nine he kidnapped. Therefore, he would have never learned of their ""connection"". And speaking of which, there were a few of the 9 he took captive that truly didn't deserve to be in that position, which again, just didn't mesh well with the overall story. However, probably the worst part of the film is the ending..or lack thereof. It literally, just cuts to black. Its like the last reel of film went missing and they couldn't afford to shoot it again. It feels like an end of an TV episode where it ends abruptly, only to be continued in the next episode. Its one of those times that when the credits start rolling, you're left saying ""really? that's it?"". As far as the acting goes, and since this was purely a dialogue kind of film, I think the cast did a decent job. The production value was also good for a low budget film like this one. Despite its flaws, I think this film is worth a one time watch. Again, its doesn't get points for originality or lack of plot holes, but you can't be expecting masterpieces from films like these so I guess I'm a little more forgiving.",3,"2.5 Stars: Not too original, but not too bad.",1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,2040,"['plot', 'one', 'pretty', 'simple', 'Nine', 'strangers', 'find', 'locked', 'room', 'masked', 'gunman', '10', 'minutes', 'one', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'were', 'brought', 'together', 'idea', 'not', 'original', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'other', 'films', 'Saw', 'series', 'immediately', 'mind', 'even', 'looking', 'film', 'still', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'First', 'off', ""'re"", 'thinking', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', 'gore', 'blood', 'torture', 'Saw', 'films', 'have', 'will', 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'violence', 'blood', 'are', 'minimal', 'suspense/thriller', 'type', 'film', 'not', 'horror', 'Again', 'concept', ""n't"", 'bad', 'script', 'execution', 'story', 'how', 'characters', 'were', 'connected', 'other', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'up', 'going', 'detail', 'potentially', 'spoiling', 'film', 'others', 'was', 'just', 'things', 'killer', 'simply', 'would', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'nine', 'kidnapped', 'Therefore', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'learned', 'connection', 'speaking', 'were', 'few', '9', 'took', 'captive', 'truly', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'position', 'again', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'overall', 'story', 'However', 'probably', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'ending..or', 'lack', 'thereof', 'literally', 'just', 'cuts', 'black', 'last', 'reel', 'film', 'went', 'missing', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'shoot', 'again', 'end', 'TV', 'episode', 'where', 'abruptly', 'only', 'be', 'continued', 'next', 'episode', 'one', 'times', 'when', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', ""'re"", 'left', 'saying', 'really', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'was', 'purely', 'dialogue', 'kind', 'film', 'think', 'cast', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'production', 'value', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'one', 'flaws', 'think', 'film', 'one', 'time', 'watch', 'Again', ""n't"", 'get', 'points', 'originality', 'lack', 'plot', 'holes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'masterpieces', 'films', 'so', 'guess', ""'m"", 'little', 'more', 'forgiving']",N/A

He then goes about kidnapping nine people. The police are alerted and so is the LA media; however they continue till he has all of them.They then find themselves hand cuffed to poles in this cell. He enters and tells them the rules. They must all work out why they are all there and what they have done to deserve to die. He will kill one of them every ten minutes until they either work out what they have done, or they are all dead.There is a digital clock in the wall which is used through out to keep the tension going. They are a mixed bunch including an insurance salesman, a cop, an assistant district attorney, a priest and a strip club owner. As they start to confess their past indiscretions, they disclose more about themselves, and some of their stories are told in flash back.Their captor has that deep semi sinister voice which is de rigueur in all of these types of films. There are pretty good performances by all involved and there are some clever plot twists. However the ending is left hanging, almost like they ran out of money, time or ideas and that is where it loses its stars. Despite a good if not original idea, some excellent acting and a good musical score, this has been let down right at the end, Chris Shadley has done a fairly good job at directing as this is a two hour film and holds your attention throughout, however if the final destination is a bit disappointing, it ultimately takes something away from the journey too.
