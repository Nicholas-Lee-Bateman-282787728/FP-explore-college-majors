568848,A33L7G4E8CID3,B000056BRJ,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[12, 23]","This incarnation of The Mutiny on the Bounty is good, but having read both Bligh's account of the mutiny and the Nordhoff and Hall version of the mutiny, I am absolutely convinced that the actual mutiny was nothing like this one. This interpretation basically lionizes the crew and simulataneously demonizes Bligh to an extent that it is hard to imagine a man as needlessly evil as Bligh or as virtuous as Fletcher Christian. I do believe that both men were partially responsible for the mutiny, and great artistic license is taken in telling the tale.That being said, this movie is a thrilling yarn about the famous mutiny. Charles Laughton is Captain Bligh, convincingly evil and a lover of absolute power. Clark Gable plays another variation on the flawless good guy characters he played until Gone With The Wind. But it is Franchot Tone who gives a moving performance as a midshipman caught in the middle of these two forces of nature. The special effects are good for the time period, the writing is good, especially the speech that Tone gives at the end at of his court-martial. All in all, it is a convincing parable about good and evil as well as a suspenseful adventure.In spite of its many virtues, the movie was hard for me to get into because of its flaws. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie was when a sailor asks for a glass of water and Bligh responds by ordering the man keelhauled. Very well, except keelhauling was illegal by British Naval Laws at that time, as was noted in Nordhoff and Hall's book. The most true thing that can be said of Bligh is that he was obsessed with following the rules and insisted that his be followed in the same fashion. That he would disobey them only shows that he is a stupid man, which wasn't true. Another scene that bothered me for the same reasons was the short scene where Bligh was talking to the Tahitian King and he says that Captain Cook was dead. Being as the Tahitians nearly deified the man, this would have the effect of making the Tahitians less cooperative. Bligh should have known this, he was Cook's first lieutenant. Aside from making Bligh an idiotic devil, Christian is nearly a canonized saint. Although most of the blame probably belongs to Bligh, as he was the captain, but Christian had to have been somewhat responsible. Gable delivers his usual limited range performance. I suppose that one has never needed acting talent to be a movie superstar. The only even remotely nuanced performance is Tone's, and thankfully he's the protagonist.In short, this movie is deeply flawed but technically impressive. The dialogue and acting are good, but the conversion to the screen lost much of the nuance that other accounts of the mutiny. If you want a truly sophisticated account of the mutiny, the Hopkins/Gibson version ""The Bounty"".",3,Overly simplified,1066521600,"10 19, 2003",2003,2813,"['incarnation', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'good', 'having', 'read', 'Bligh', 'account', 'mutiny', 'Nordhoff', 'Hall', 'version', 'mutiny', 'am', 'absolutely', 'convinced', 'actual', 'mutiny', 'was', 'nothing', 'one', 'interpretation', 'basically', 'crew', 'simulataneously', 'Bligh', 'extent', 'hard', 'imagine', 'man', 'needlessly', 'Bligh', 'as', 'virtuous', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'do', 'believe', 'men', 'were', 'partially', 'responsible', 'mutiny', 'great', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'telling', 'tale.That', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'thrilling', 'yarn', 'famous', 'mutiny', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'convincingly', 'evil', 'lover', 'absolute', 'power', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'variation', 'flawless', 'good', 'guy', 'characters', 'played', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'who', 'moving', 'performance', 'midshipman', 'caught', 'middle', 'two', 'forces', 'nature', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'time', 'period', 'writing', 'good', 'especially', 'speech', 'Tone', 'end', 'court-martial', 'convincing', 'parable', 'good', 'evil', 'as', 'well', 'suspenseful', 'adventure.In', 'spite', 'many', 'virtues', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'flaws', 'One', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'sailor', 'glass', 'water', 'Bligh', 'responds', 'ordering', 'man', 'keelhauled', 'Very', 'well', 'keelhauling', 'was', 'illegal', 'British', 'Naval', 'Laws', 'time', 'was', 'noted', 'Nordhoff', 'Hall', 'book', 'most', 'true', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Bligh', 'was', 'obsessed', 'following', 'rules', 'insisted', 'be', 'followed', 'same', 'fashion', 'would', 'disobey', 'only', 'stupid', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', 'scene', 'bothered', 'same', 'reasons', 'was', 'short', 'scene', 'where', 'Bligh', 'was', 'talking', 'Tahitian', 'King', 'Captain', 'Cook', 'was', 'dead', 'Being', 'Tahitians', 'nearly', 'deified', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'effect', 'making', 'Tahitians', 'less', 'cooperative', 'Bligh', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'Cook', 'first', 'lieutenant', 'Aside', 'making', 'Bligh', 'idiotic', 'devil', 'Christian', 'nearly', 'canonized', 'saint', 'most', 'blame', 'probably', 'Bligh', 'was', 'captain', 'Christian', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'responsible', 'Gable', 'delivers', 'usual', 'limited', 'range', 'performance', 'suppose', 'one', 'never', 'needed', 'acting', 'talent', 'be', 'movie', 'superstar', 'only', 'even', 'remotely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Tone', 'thankfully', 'protagonist.In', 'short', 'movie', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'technically', 'impressive', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'are', 'good', 'conversion', 'screen', 'lost', 'much', 'nuance', 'other', 'accounts', 'mutiny', 'want', 'truly', 'sophisticated', 'account', 'mutiny', 'Hopkins/Gibson', 'version', 'Bounty']",N/A

568852,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000056BRJ,Alex Udvary,"[14, 19]","You'll noticed most of the early Oscar winners were films that were heavy-handed. They appeared as if they wanted to be seen as important. Watch &quot;Wings&quot;, &quot;All Quite On The Western Front&quot;, &quot;Cimarron&quot;, &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot;, and director Frank Lloyd's other Oscar winner &quot;Cavalcade&quot;. All of these films seem as if they are shoving an important message down our throats, mind you, not that they are bad films, well, maybe except for &quot;Cimarron&quot;. But, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; is actually one of the few films to have won the Oscar that didn't appear as &quot;important&quot; as the others. It appears as if it merely wants to entertain. Other films that belong on that list are &quot;The Broadway Melody of 1929&quot;, and two Frank Capra films &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; &amp; &quot;You Can't Take It With You&quot;. And that's it.&quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; when released was one of the most expensive films ever made, I believe somewhere between 2-4 million. But watch the wonderful detail given to the film. There are lavish production and costume designs. So, if you like that sort of thing, keep your eyes open.Now, I've noticed that some people bash the movie because they feel it doesn't create an accurate description of what really happened. My answer to this is, who cares? Lets judge the movie on cinematic terms not historical. As a movie does it entertain? Yes. Is there good acting? Yes. You have three Oscar nominated performances here, Charles Laughton, to me comes out looking the best. Clark Gable gives one of his best, though, I admit I never really thought of him as a &quot;great&quot; actor. He was fine for certain roles but I never felt he had a wide range. Though to be fair I must admit he did have a lot of charisma, which is undoubtedly why he made in it the movies. And finally you have Franchot Tone who gives a warm performance as Roger Byam. Another important question to ask is how is the directing? Lloyd who had just won the Oscar for &quot;Cavalcade&quot; I think does a better job here. So, please don't judge the movie based on historical facts. We should all know the movies embellish the truth. Judge the film on the own merits. So is it a good movie? Yes. It proves to entertain it's audiences, it has some wonderful acting, handsome sets and costumes, moments of action and human drama, and is mildly amusing at times. It is worth seeing if your a Laughton or Gable fan. Or if you interested in seeing the early Oscar winners.Here's an interesting fact. Did you know Wallace Berry was the original choice for Capt. Bligh? He turned the role down because he didn't like Gable, and didn't want to be on set with him for a long period of time. What makes this so interesting is if anyone out there is 500 years old like myself you'll recall the two made some films togther. In 1935, the same year as this picture they made &quot;China Seas&quot; (Jean Harlow co-starred), and &quot;Hell Divers&quot; (A movie about two rival pilots) which I think was made in 1931 maybe 1930, I'm not sure.  *** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: One of the more entertaing early Oscar winners. Not as heavy-handed.

568853,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000056BRJ,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","The 1984 VHS edition of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY (powder blue and gray cover scheme) comes in an oversized lidded cardboard box. The tape is stored within, held firmly in place in a black plastic tray.Although this is probably the least historically accurate of the four popular versions of the H.M.S. Bounty story, it is surely the most entertaining. Characters tend to be one-dimensional. As scripted, Laughton's Lt. Bligh is portrayed as a tireless tyrant and Gable's Spencer Christian is the noble savior from their sufferings of his crewmates. No shades of gray here: it's snow white vs. coal black.A 1984 remake,THE BOUNTY(with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins) may come closest to the truth. In it, Bligh has martinet tendencies but also shows reasonableness and competence, while Christian's motives for the mutiny are far more suspect and he's not exactly a superb leader. Subsequent British courts martial proceedings are also included. In this older film, once Pitcairn's Island is reached and the Bounty scuttled, the story ends with a brief scroll's vague epilogue on the mutineers' fate.Again the bottom line is, thanks to a remarkable cast and superior cinematography and direction (from Frank Lloyd)  this high seas treason story is an eminently watchable work of fiction and therefore gets a highest recommendation.

There's a newsreel clip of the acceptance of the award, and it's really funny if you compare it to the Academy Award ceremonies of more recent years. Apparently it was done in a restaurant or banquet hall, and while the award (mind you, for Best Picture!) is being handed over and the acceptance speech made, you can hear the clinking of glasses and the murmur of voices. Yes, things certainly have changed since 1935.Clark Gable, very young and sleek as a feline, plays Fletcher Christian, the First Officer who leads the mutiny against the tyrannical Captain Bligh, as sadistically cruel and dishonest as you can imagine. Franchot Tone plays midshipman Byam, Christian's friend who is nevertheless loyal to Bligh out of a sense of duty. But he gets left on board when Bligh and some of his henchmen are put adrift in a boat simply because there was no more room in the boat. Three or four other sailors were similarly left on board for the same reason. In an amazing feat of endurance and seamanship, Bligh and his dehydrated, starved crew survive some two months at sea and come safely to port.Meanwhile, Christian has taken the ship back to Tahiti, where he and Byam had both fallen in love with native girls who were delighted to see them come back. They have a wonderful time in this hedonistic paradise until a British ship is spotted on the horizon. Hurriedly gathering up their property, what food and water they can store, and their native wives and children, Christian and the other mutineers, along with several native men who also wanted to go with them scramble aboard the Bounty and head for ""some other island.""When Byam and the others who had been left behind on the Bounty when it was taken over, but who had been loyal to Bligh, greet the British ship with glee, assuming that since they had no part in the mutiny, they would be welcomed and carried home. It turns out Bligh is in command of this ship, and promptly claps them in irons to be taken back to England for trial.But in a storm, they founder for going too dangerously close to reefs in their search for Christian, and once again have to take to the lifeboats. But they made it safely, and the next we see is the crew who had been loyal to Bligh on trial for mutiny because Bligh accuses them.

With this pedigree, I expected great things from &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty.&quot;  But this film for me, while never less than entertaining, fell far short of greatness.  It's a solid action film with a script more literate than your average action movie to be sure, but I was still left somewhat cold by it.Much of the adoration of this film seems to spring from a love of the central performances, namely those of Charles Laughton and Clark Gable.  Both of course are good, but Laughton's character suffers from a silent movie villain's one-noteness. He does sadistic well, but that's about all he's required to do.  Clark Gable impressed me more, and made me think that maybe he's a better actor than I ever gave him credit for.  But for me, the standout performer (and the one I hear the least about) is Franchot Tone, playing a young idealist, enamored with the romance of life at sea and not prepared for the petty brutalities and politics.  Tone is forced to give the most nuanced performance, as he straddles the line between loyalty to upper command and humanity for his fellow shipmates.  In contrast to Laughton and Gable's showy roles, Tone's is quiet and thoughtful, except for a last-minute soliloquy that he handles well.The production is never less than impressive, especially for 1935. The special effects are solid, as is the attention paid to period detail.  But for some reason, despite the good things I have to say about the film, I just never got that into it. It's like any  number of solidly crafted films released today: competent, fairly intelligent and well done, but not especially artistic or unique.  One gets the feeling that it achieves what it sets out to do; one just wished it had set out to do a little more than it does.Grade: B",3,Early Best Picture Winner Disappoints Somewhat,1079308800,"03 15, 2004",2004,1876,"['1935', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'AFI', 'list', 'best', '100', 'films', 'century', '20th', 'pedigree', 'expected', 'great', 'things', 'quot', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty.', 'quot', 'film', 'never', 'less', 'entertaining', 'fell', 'far', 'short', 'greatness', 'solid', 'action', 'film', 'script', 'more', 'literate', 'average', 'action', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'was', 'still', 'left', 'somewhat', 'cold', 'it.Much', 'adoration', 'film', 'spring', 'love', 'central', 'performances', 'namely', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'course', 'are', 'good', 'Laughton', 'character', 'suffers', 'silent', 'movie', 'villain', 'one-noteness', 'sadistic', 'well', 'required', 'do', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'impressed', 'more', 'made', 'think', 'maybe', 'better', 'actor', 'ever', 'gave', 'credit', 'standout', 'performer', 'one', 'hear', 'least', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'playing', 'young', 'idealist', 'enamored', 'romance', 'life', 'sea', 'not', 'prepared', 'petty', 'brutalities', 'politics', 'Tone', 'forced', 'give', 'most', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'line', 'loyalty', 'upper', 'command', 'humanity', 'fellow', 'shipmates', 'contrast', 'Laughton', 'Gable', 'showy', 'roles', 'Tone', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'last-minute', 'soliloquy', 'well.The', 'production', 'never', 'less', 'impressive', 'especially', '1935', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'solid', 'attention', 'paid', 'period', 'detail', 'reason', 'good', 'things', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'number', 'solidly', 'crafted', 'films', 'released', 'today', 'competent', 'fairly', 'intelligent', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'especially', 'artistic', 'unique', 'One', 'feeling', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'one', 'just', 'wished', 'had', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'does.Grade', 'B']",N/A

Captain Bligh is charged with sailing the Bounty to Tahiti to harvest breadfruit plants for transplant to the West Indies - what should ultimately be a two-year mission.  He is commander of a crew made up of both volunteers and those pressed into service by His Majesty's Royal Navy, the latter group being significantly less enthusiastic about their voyage.  Bligh's discipline often crosses the line into malicious sadism and as the months wear on, many in the crew begin to contemplate a mutiny which they execute shortly after departing Tahiti.  Bligh is put into a small boat with those of the crew who remain loyal and performs the amazing feat of sailing 3500 miles over 45 days with very little provision.  He eventually returns to Tahiti, where first mate Christian and the rest of the mutineers reside along with some of the loyal crew who wouldn't fit on the boat.  Capture, return to England, trial, and execution ensue for some of the mutineers.""Mutiny"" is great not because of the acting - Laughton is tremendous as Bligh, Gable is only servicable as Christian, and Tone is poor as conflicted midshipman Byam - but because of the characters that make up the story.  Those performances which are less-than-great are swallowed up by the flow of the story which you can almost feel as an inevitable force driving them all to their fate.  Bligh is to mean to die, Christian is too noble to die, Byam is to honorable to die.  But each receives a very different reward for their actions.The supporting cast is very solid and really conveys the sense of frustration and anger that builds as time passes on the Bounty.  The shots of the Bounty on the open ocean are magnificent and are easily the equal of those from ""Master and Commander"".  However, the obviously anglo ""Tahitians"" can be pretty distracting to someone who's grown up in politically correct America.  Still, it's a minor point, especially in the black-and-white format.A true classic.

He was a common man who through pain &amp; suffering climbed to the rank of Lieutantant.  Hating Christian for his being a refined gentleman and well educated officer.  This story vividly shows us the world of the seaman via 1787 and how an unspeakable &quot;MUTINY&quot; results.  An outstanding movie and the players are well casted for their roles!!Extra features include;  Vintage documentary - &quot;Pitcairn Island Today&quot; (circa 1935), Academy Award Newsreel and Theartical Trailers (1935 &amp; remake with Marlon Brando 1962).This is a must have DVD for your Home Theatre library.

It appears that as early as 1935, Hollywood had showed that it had no qualms about letting wholesale historical inaccuracies and character assassinations get in the way of an entertaining story.  The only trouble is that the portrayal of the story is so far-fetched and the pace of the movie so pedantic that it makes me convinced that this movie only won the Oscar because the also rans that year were probably not much better.The portrayal of Bligh as a vile animal is so overboard that only the most gullible would believe that he was the sole reason for the mutiny and could possibly have been that evil.  Let's just say that the Oscars would see a lot better quality nominees let alone winners of the best picture award over the years than this one.  As the movie is based upon a version of events that is so heavily slanted in favour of the mutineers against Bligh, one shouldn't be surprised except that the attempt to white wash the deeds of the mutineers is so nauseatingly obvious that it just detracts totally from the enjoyment of the film.  It's hard to enjoy a film that loses credibility so early on.The quality of the DVD transfers is also not very good; the video quality is patchy and so is the sound.  One redeeming factor is the special features which includes a very interesting documentary on the real-life Pitcairn Islanders at the time.  For diehard fans of this movie, I'd recommend waiting for a better DVD transfer to be released.  For those interested in finding out the truth of this historical event, give this DVD a wide berth and head straight for your local library.Updated 20 April 2011:As Amazon will not allow me to review the Blu-ray release separately I have to update this review for that.  The picture book is very pleasant to look at while the picture and sound quality is improved a little but not as jaw-droppingly well asThe Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray] and is closer to what they did withKing Kong [Blu-ray Book].  The special features are nothing to shout about but having seen the dvd, I do have to say that although the picture quality here isn't perfect, it is still better on blu-ray but like the King Kong release is not that much better.",2,"Extremely Overrated, Factually Inaccurate, Undeserving Oscar Winner of 1935!

568872,A1UYL5GIQ8YE77,B000056BRJ,Fred L. Houpt,"[0, 0]","Of the three famous movies devoted to this subject, I have seen the Laughton/Gable and Hopkins/Gibson so far.  Brando/Howard I have yet to watch, but now that I've seen Laughton, I will have to see Brando.  As someone who becomes obsessed with historical events, I have read a very in-depth account of Bligh's life.  On this, my first impression of the Laughton/Gable version, what strikes me right away is the era in which it was made.  It looks dated because it is dated.  I am most curious about the development of the script.  I am halfway through a very interesting bio on Laughton by Charles Higham, and he makes it clear that Laughton's approach to the film was fully committed.  Laughton plunged into the role with great zest, reading copiously about Bligh's life and the famous mutiny and even putting himself through a crash diet to shed a huge amount of weight so that he would appear to be the same physical form as the real Bligh.  He found the shop where Bligh's clothing had been made, and amazingly enough, it was still in business.  He ordered a replica of Bligh's military dress clothes which was reproduced with complete accuracy.  While I don't think it important enough to the movie I will say in passing that Gable and Laughton loathed each other, often having so much friction that shooting had to be scrapped for days on end.What puzzles me more is that why Laughton decided to inhabit Bligh as a raging despotic captain?  Laughton was famous for transforming his characters and imbuing them with humane touches.  Not always but often.  In this role he opted to create a monotone ruthless dictator who used every chance to apply the horrors of the Articles of War against all the men on his ship.  His characterization was one obsession: instil fear into this crew or they would rebel and anarchy would prevail.  All of that was true at the time but his Bligh is surprisingly two dimensional.  Clark Gable acted just as we would have expected him to in that time of his life. As many have commented, it is a blessing that he didn't try to speak with an English accent.As a historically based movie it owes its allegiance to the Nordoff-Hall book (which I have not read) rather than to what historians knew in the 1930's.  This is first and foremost an entertainment vehicle, not a documentary.  It is meant to stir the passions of the audience and to make a profit.  This it accomplished.  If one wants to become more familiar with the historical inaccuracies, then read &#34;The Bounty: the true story of the Mutiny on the Bounty&#34; by Caroline Alexander.  A wonderfully rich and deeply researched book that separates facts from fancy.  (Side note: one of the strangest things about the Bounty voyage, is that Bligh insisted that his men dance on the ship as a type of daily exercise.  They resented being forced to appear gay and full of glee when many of the men had been abducted and pressed into service, leaving their loved ones at home.  For us today it is ludicrous but it could have been used to outline how bent Bligh's methodology became and how it helped foster the ship wide rebellion against him.)Seen from 2014, the 1935 film does look a bit overly mannered and for me, too rigid.  It would not be my favourite Laughton film and again I am puzzled why he went so over the top with his acting.  This, from someone who had become the first method actor, who had to feel his way into his roles.  There were other acting options available and it is possible that Laughton felt that this is what the audiences had expected and could understand.  The end result is rather exaggerated.  Frankly, I think that Sir Anthony Hopkins's Bligh is more believable and is a more balanced and nuanced performance.  As much as I loath Mel Gibson as a person, his Fletcher Christian is a good role for him and he delivers a solid performance.  I prefer that film over the Laughton/Gable version.  As I have mentioned in other reviews, there are very good naval yarns made into movies that get the historical facts dead on: &#34;Master and Commander&#34; will always be a great example of a director who did his homework and faithfully reproduced a period in time with the least amount of historical errors.  Sadly, this Frank Lloyd version went about half way and then stopped.  A stirring drama yes, fine performances all around yes.  Natives that were sanitized and made to stare into the camera as if drugged, yes.  Historically accurate, better not ask.  Enjoy it for what it is.

568873,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000056BRJ,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[23, 25]","Based on the then-popular novel by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, the 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY is among a series of legendary films of the 1930s that have been repeatedly celebrated for cinematic achievement. And small wonder: the film has a host of powerful assets.The single most obvious among these is the star power involved: led by two Oscar-winning stars, the critically formidable Charles Laughton and the incredibly popular Clark Gable, the cast reads like a Who's Who of mid-1930s male actors ranging from leading man Franchot Tone to the memorable character actor Donald Crisp.  In a visual sense, the film is also a knockout: filmed on location in a full-size replica of the Bounty, it set a new standard for capturing the sea on film.  And the story itself is powerful, the tale of the battle between the cruel and autocratic Bligh and the humane and populist Fletcher Christian.  Taken together, it makes for a powerful ride.Still, some viewers may not find MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY all it is cracked to be.  Then as now, Hollywood was less interested in getting the facts right than in telling a good story--and from a factual point of view the film is perhaps twenty percent accurate and eighty percent nothing more nor less than historical tarradiddle.  That is no real hinderance per se; after all, we're not watching a documentary.  But seen from a modern standpoint the cast now feels somewhat problematic.Charles Laughton was so critically well regarded that he received star billing over Clark Gable for the film, and seen today his performance is easily the single most powerful in the entire film.  Autocratic, brilliant, and immediately and increasingly unlikable, he drives the film from start to finish--and it is here, really, in which most of the film's historical accuracy resides.  The rest of the cast, however, is extremely Hollywood.  Clark Gable, Franchot Tone and all the rest give an excellent show, full of power and drive--but you never for a moment forget that they are indeed Hollywood stars and not members of the British Navy.This is very much a ""big"" film in the MGM tradition, often brilliant, often memorable, and often setting new standards for the motion picture industry.  And when regarded from that point of view it is extremely, extremely entertaining.  But it may also be a film whose power has slightly faded with the passing of time.The DVD package is slight and less informative than simply entertaining, including trailers, a scrap of newsreel footage, and (most interesting) a short documentary on Pitcairn Island as it existed about the time MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY was made.  Although the picture and sound have not been restored per se, both are best-possible-quality short of digital restoration.

568874,A391UWNYC7K7JS,B000056BRJ,"Gary Gardner ""Your resident dillettante""","[1, 2]","Truly, there was no better high-seas epic than the original 1935 version of ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" The great American actor, Clark Gable, paired off with one of Britain's greats, Charles Laughton--along with a fantastic supporting cast--to create a Hollywood classic.Based loosely upon a true story set in early 1800's England, the H.M.S. Bounty, a frigate bound for Fiji in order to stock up on fruit trees to bring back to Blighty, sets course under the brutal leadership of Captain Bligh (Laughton). First Mate Fletcher Christian (Gable) tries admirably to keep his dignity under Bligh's chafing while trying diplomatically to keep Bligh from punishing the crew too harshly. In fact, much of the crew are recruits from British prisons who chose to labor at sea rather than wear balls and chains in English cells.After many months of Bligh's harsh treatment, the chance to go ashore at Fiji proves a welcome respite. But Christian is forbidden to go ashore; luckily, local tribe leader Tehanni (Movita) intercedes, talking Bligh into letting the First Mate come ashore. Bligh concedes, not wishing to anger the man who allows him to take his fruit trees back home.Christian falls in love with the island, and with a local island girl. Fellow officer Roger Byam (Franchot Tone) has similar tastes, and even goes so far as to study the island's linguistics if ever he is to return to Fiji. But Captain Bligh takes control as the return voyage begins. Christian tires of the gratuitous beatings meted out by the sadistic sea captain. Mutiny is inevitable, as Christian and Byam (less eagerly) wrest control of the Bounty, and send Captain Bligh adrift in a lifeboat with his loyal men, leaving them to fend for themselves.Thus begins a story of revenge for one man, and an attempt at refuge for another. The story moves along briskly, showing how the eventual climactic battle for superiority on the high seas must play out. Laughton's performance is truly memorable, evoking decades of comedic imitations in numerous cartoons and comedy-club stages. The pairing of American and British actors strangely works for this film. Perhaps it is because the sets were so incredibly believable, the cinematography absolutely brilliant. It is hard to believe this was only a black-and-white film, so vivid are its backdrops.There have been other movies depicting the plight of the Bounty, but none have been as exhilarating as this.

Snyder,"[0, 0]","This Blu-ray transcription captures the resolution of the original 35mm film, but it cannot be expected to compensate for the limitations of 80-year-old technology. MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY appears on today's high definition televisions only as sharp as it did originally in theaters, with the many instances of rear projection backgrounds looking fuzzy to the modern viewer. The movie was held in high regard in 1935, as indicated by its winning of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Its three lead actors, Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone were all nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, thereby insuring that none of them would be able to win it. The Best Actor award went to the only non-BOUNTY nominee, Victor McLaglen, for his performance in The Informer. Emerging from a crowded field of twelve nominees for Best Picture, BOUNTY was praised not only for its actors, but for its dramatic screen presentation of an epic story and for the exotic South Pacific shooting locations which helped to make it the most expensive motion picture up to that time.Compared to more recent films, including two remakes of Mutiny on the Bounty, the 1935 version might seem a bit stagey and confined, but consider the facts: it was made in the first decade of the sound era, depended heavily on primitive rear-projection effects for dramatic moments at sea, was subject to a production code so restrictive that it required women's navels to be either covered with clothing or obliterated with makeup, and did not have the benefit of color photography to emphasize the exotic nature of its location footage. The consequent ""defects"" were not apparent to audiences of 1935, because MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY was state of the art at the time, a thrilling adventure story of unprecedented on-location scope, and featuring some of the most respected actors of the day. Clark Gable had won the Best Actor Oscar in 1934 for It Happened One Night, while Charles Laughton had won in 1933 for The Private Life of Henry VIII, the first-ever win for a non-American. In BOUNTY, Gable was his usual affable and believable self and made a sympathetic Fletcher Christian, Tone was a fresh and eager Midshipman, but it was Laughton who stole the show as the villainous Captain Bligh.The real Captain Bligh was not the madman depicted in the movies, and went on to a distinguished career in the Royal Navy after the mutiny, a career marked by promotion all the way up to Admiral. But he was an especially stern taskmaster, and not a favorite with his subordinates, traits magnified in the screen portrayals of Bligh. Despite vastly improved production values in the later versions of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, it is Laughton's performance and image that are best remembered as the definitive face of the tyrant. In one of the fact-based incidents in the film, following the mutiny Bligh commands a small open boat with 18 loyal crewmen, in an epic journey of nearly 4,000 miles across the Pacific to safety in Timor.MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY is well worth a look, both as an interesting story and as a significant bit of Hollywood history.

568887,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000056BRJ,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","#86 on The American Film Institute's Top 100, ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" is one of the few films to receive only the Best Picture Oscar at the 1935 Academy Award ceremony. It's a film that begins slowly and then slowly builds to becoming a great masterpiece of film with terrific performances by Charles Laughton and Clark Gable. This movie proves along with ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""It Happened One Night"" why Gable is one of the most remembered actors. His charm and likeability is in top form in this film. I'm not a big fan of movies that take place almost entirely at sea (even ""great"" films like Master & Commander didn't rub me the right way), but ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" is an exception due to the great performances and the fact that once it takes off, it's pretty entertaining. Gable plays first officer Fletcher Christian, who in the opening of the film gathers up people to go aboard a ship called The Bounty. There they will dedicate two years of their lives to the ships, whether they like it or not. Christian and midshipman Byam (Franchot Tone) are nice enough but it's Captain Bligh (Laughton) that makes the ship a living hell for everyone. Bligh is a fat, ugly, mean man who takes pleasure in flogging his crewmembers and accusing them of things they haven't done. When he's caught in a lie, he responds by having the ""catcher"" flogged. Christian is smart enough to know that he has no choice but to tolerate Bligh's abuse, but Christian's temper is just as bad as Bligh's. Finally, he snaps and mutiny occurs on the Bounty...Although, I'm sure you probably already figured that out. It's little wonder that Gable, Laughton, and Tone were all nominated for Best Actor (they all lost to Victor McLaglen) for the first and only time in Oscar history, although the Best Supporting Actor category did not yet exist. ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" is not, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. It is a great film that has aged better than a lot of films that were made 20 years after it and for 1935, a lot of the special effects are well done. This film is probably one of the littlest known films on that top 100 list, yet it deserves more viewings than other films on the list like ""The Jazz Singer"" and, dare I say it, ""Ben-Hur."" It won't appeal to everyone, but it's worth seeing for the performances alone. Both Gable and Tone are very likeable and charismatic, while Laughton isn't a character you love to hate.

At times the story telling boarders on being pedantic, a trend which starts right at the beginning with the opening prologue.""In December, 1787, H.M.S. Bounty lay in Portsmouth harbour on the eve of departure for Tahiti in the uncharted waters of the Great South sea.The Bounty's mission was to procure breadfruit trees for transplanting to the West Indies as cheap food for slaves.Neither ship nor breadfruit reached the West Indies. Mutiny prevented it--mutiny against the harsh eighteenth century sea law. But this mutiny, famous in history and legend, helped bring about a new discipline, based upon mutual respect between officers and men, by which Britain's sea power is maintained as security for all who pass upon the seas.""Like a lot of old movies, subtlety is not always this films strong point.The prologue pretty much spells out the films plot (which I guess we kind of knew already anyway from the title). And yet it is 1 hour 2o minutes into the film before the mutiny takes place. And during that time you are just patiently waiting for what you already know is going to happen anyway.During the first 1 hour and 20 minutes the crew is given no lack of motivation to mutiny. In fact ""The Simpson's"" parody, in which Captain Bligh seems to almost want the crew to mutiny, isn't too far off the mark.The last 40 minutes of the film, which deal with the aftermath of the mutiny, is in my opinion the most interesting part. And a good history lesson to all us Americans ignorant of British naval history (although there are some historical inaccuracies in the film).",4,"Slightly Pedantic, but Fascinating story",1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,1691,"['fascinating', 'story', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'even', 'style', 'story', 'telling', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'times', 'story', 'telling', 'boarders', 'being', 'pedantic', 'trend', 'right', 'beginning', 'opening', 'prologue', 'December', '1787', 'H.M.S', 'Bounty', 'lay', 'Portsmouth', 'harbour', 'eve', 'departure', 'Tahiti', 'uncharted', 'waters', 'Great', 'South', 'sea.The', 'Bounty', 'mission', 'was', 'procure', 'breadfruit', 'trees', 'transplanting', 'West', 'Indies', 'cheap', 'food', 'slaves.Neither', 'ship', 'breadfruit', 'reached', 'West', 'Indies', 'Mutiny', 'prevented', 'mutiny', 'harsh', 'eighteenth', 'century', 'sea', 'law', 'mutiny', 'famous', 'history', 'legend', 'helped', 'bring', 'about', 'new', 'discipline', 'based', 'mutual', 'respect', 'officers', 'men', 'Britain', 'sea', 'power', 'maintained', 'security', 'who', 'pass', 'seas', 'lot', 'old', 'movies', 'subtlety', 'not', 'always', 'films', 'strong', 'point.The', 'prologue', 'pretty', 'much', 'spells', 'out', 'films', 'plot', 'guess', 'kind', 'knew', 'already', 'anyway', 'title', 'yet', '1', 'hour', '2o', 'minutes', 'film', 'mutiny', 'place', 'time', 'are', 'just', 'patiently', 'waiting', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'going', 'happen', 'anyway.During', 'first', '1', 'hour', '20', 'minutes', 'crew', 'given', 'lack', 'motivation', 'mutiny', 'fact', 'Simpson', 'parody', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'almost', 'want', 'crew', 'mutiny', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'mark.The', 'last', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'deal', 'aftermath', 'mutiny', 'opinion', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'good', 'history', 'lesson', 'Americans', 'ignorant', 'British', 'naval', 'history', 'are', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'film']",N/A

It is simply one of the best sea epics and even more so because it's relatively factual about a brutal sea captain of the British Navy. The acting, direction, art direction are all excellent. While mutiny is usually not a good thing, the true story guides the viewer to understand why Mr. Christian felt that he had no choice. And for this choice, he and his crew were punished, not by the courts, but by themselves in a self imposed marooning in a desolate island.

Both Laughton and Gable are excellent in their lead roles and the supporting cast is also good. With that, many people would be content to give this a 5 star review but I do like historical movies to be true and not to bend the truth to suit their purposes.-The Real Captain Bligh was not a tyrant or a villain. His record as a captain showed that the trips he commanded had a good deal less than average floggings and that Bligh was not an excessive disciplinarian for his time. He was actually on the lenient side.-It is said that the real Bligh did not suffer fools well. He was not a perfect man then but nothing resembling the villain.-The real Christian Fletcher was just 22 years old at the time.Due to his youth, he was not second in command on ""the Bounty"" but was an officer.-Bligh and Fletcher had sailed together previously and both volunteered to sail again together.-The real Fletcher was probably motivated by a desire to return to the great climate and lifestyle of Tahiti and his Tahitian wife more than any dislke of Bligh. To its credit, this movie does note this motivation but places it as secondary.The 1984 Mel Gibson remake was not 100% accurate but was very much closer to the truth. For its entertainment value, this deserves an ""A' and for those who don't care about historical truth, leave it at that. For its historical accuracy, it gets a ""C"" at best.

Released in 1935, the acting is just as powerful as a modern movie. Yes, the special effects might not be as stellar, but it's the acting that carries this true-life story through its twists and turns.Yes, there really was a ship named the Bounty, and on April 28, 1789, there really was a well documented mutiny. Ship's logs, the captain's diary, and other records indicate what happened when Fletcher Christian led his crew against the overbearing Captain William Bligh. It is amazing the level of detail we know about who was involved, where the ship went, and what the day by day results were from an event over two hundred years in the past.When Laughton and Gable sought to re-create this event, there were definitely liberties taken. If you compare the official records against this one, there are many gaps. So it's important to know up front that this is not a documentary. Instead, this is a dramatic retelling. If it intrigues you enough, you can then go online to find out what really happened and where all of the various characters ended up.So that being said, the actors in this 1935 version get the highest kudos for their acting. They could easily have all blended together into ""random pile of sailors on a small boat"". Instead, we get a strong sense of their backgrounds and movitations. Bligh isn't just a bully. He's an incredibly capable sailor who has had to claw his way to the top past men who looked down on him for his birth. Christian doesn't just flip on Bligh at the first grumpy action. He stays with it, defending his Captain, his sense of honor being eroded away with each passing day until he just can't take it any more.Yes, we have the nearly-naked Tahitian girls who instantly fall in love with any white man who crosses their path - quite a difference from what happened in real life. And yes, the ending doesn't quite match up with reality. But again, we have to look at this in terms of the story it is choosing to tell. That story grabs a hold of us, draws us in, and makes us eager to find out what happens next.Highly recommended, as a showing of just how well done and powerful an ""older movie"" can be.I acquired this movie with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.",5,Still Impressive after all these years,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,2379,"['nay-sayers', 'who', 'say', 'older', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'AFI', 'top', '100', 'listing', 'point', 'strong', 'finger', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Released', '1935', 'acting', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'modern', 'movie', 'Yes', 'special', 'effects', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'stellar', 'acting', 'true-life', 'story', 'twists', 'turns.Yes', 'really', 'was', 'ship', 'named', 'Bounty', 'April', '28', '1789', 'really', 'was', 'well', 'documented', 'mutiny', 'Ship', 'logs', 'captain', 'diary', 'other', 'records', 'indicate', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'led', 'crew', 'overbearing', 'Captain', 'William', 'Bligh', 'amazing', 'level', 'detail', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'where', 'ship', 'went', 'what', 'day', 'day', 'results', 'were', 'event', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'past.When', 'Laughton', 'Gable', 'sought', 're-create', 'event', 'were', 'definitely', 'taken', 'compare', 'official', 'records', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'gaps', 'important', 'know', 'up', 'front', 'not', 'documentary', 'Instead', 'dramatic', 'retelling', 'enough', 'can', 'then', 'go', 'online', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'where', 'various', 'characters', 'ended', 'up.So', 'being', 'said', 'actors', '1935', 'version', 'get', 'highest', 'kudos', 'acting', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'blended', 'together', 'random', 'pile', 'sailors', 'small', 'boat', 'Instead', 'get', 'strong', 'sense', 'backgrounds', 'movitations', 'Bligh', ""n't"", 'just', 'bully', 'incredibly', 'capable', 'sailor', 'who', 'had', 'claw', 'way', 'top', 'past', 'men', 'who', 'looked', 'down', 'birth', 'Christian', ""n't"", 'just', 'flip', 'Bligh', 'first', 'grumpy', 'action', 'defending', 'Captain', 'sense', 'honor', 'being', 'eroded', 'away', 'passing', 'day', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'more.Yes', 'have', 'nearly-naked', 'Tahitian', 'girls', 'who', 'instantly', 'fall', 'love', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'path', 'quite', 'difference', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'yes', 'ending', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'up', 'reality', 'again', 'have', 'look', 'terms', 'story', 'choosing', 'tell', 'story', 'grabs', 'hold', 'eager', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'next.Highly', 'recommended', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'powerful', 'older', 'movie', 'can', 'be.I', 'acquired', 'movie', 'own', 'funds', 'purpose', 'doing', 'review']",N/A

It has even been filmed three times. Captain Bligh has gone down in history as the epitome of tyranny and Fletcher Christian has become a symbol of man's struggle against tyranny. Good against evil. Tyranny against freedom. A David verses Goliath story, if you will, or a George Washington verses George III. If you want to know why this myth has become so enduring - and it is a myth as the true story is no-where near as black and white, as the 1980s remake hints at - then watch this film.Clark Gable is utterly convincing as the hero who can take no more of Captain Bligh's tyrannical leadership and leads the men to mutiny against him. His performance knocks both Marlon Brando and Mel Gibson's later feeble efforts into a three-cornered hat. Best of all is Charles Laughton's portrayal of Captain Bligh. Bligh is tyranny personified. His very presence on screen oozes menace. His eyes glare malevolently at his crew. Every word that comes out of his mouth drips with contempt. Never has an actor portrayed evil so convincingly and so thoroughly. Most actors would overplay it. Laughton, the master that he is, gets it exactly right. Loathsome though Bligh is, he never becomes a caricature. He is a man as well as a monster. (Tim Roth and Alan Rickman should eat their hearts out.) It is one of the best performances in 20th Century cinema.This film works at every level: the brisk pacing, the characterisation of the ships crew, the sets scenes on board ship and on the Island of Tahiti, and the cinematography.

The movie is based on the famous true story of a mutiny among the men of the H.M.S. Bounty, a British ship sailing the South Pacific in 1789. Gable plays Fletcher Christian, the second officer, who eventually leads the rebellion against Captain William Bligh. The great Charles Laughton, who suffered constantly from seasickness, plays Bligh. This is a grand sea adventure - although most of it was shot on MGM back lots and off the California and Mexican coasts. The story was filmed twice more - in 1962, with Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard, and in 1984, with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins, in the Christian and Bligh roles, respectively (and with a lot more Polynesian female flesh exposed, particularly in the Gibson version) - but this production more than holds its own. Yes, Gable is terrific as Christian, but Laughton steals the movie, playing Bligh as gloriously sadistic and unrepentant.

I watched two of them before I got down to this--not really expecting to see it through.So, imagine my surprise when I, not only sat through the whole thing, but actually enjoyed it.  It's a great story---who cares if it's not historically accurate--we can Google for that.  It moves along quickly.  We see the horrible stuff but somehow it gives us enough happy scenes so you don't just want to turn the film off.  The stay in Tahiti is a rest, not just for the sailors but for the viewers.It is a terrific story and it does help to know that it actually happened, more or less.  What really brings it home is the acting.  As everyone here has said, Charles Laughton, as Captain Bligh is a most despicable hero--not just hideously cruel but there's something about his pudgy body and puffy, pouty mouth that really gives you the creeps.His perfect counterpart, the gorgeous, hunky, dimpled Clark Gable is endearing from the opening scene in which we see he is a man's man, but has a heart.  Oh, those dimples!He truly deserves the heart of the beautiful native girl who falls in love with him.  The plot twists a bit, holding your interest, as Gable as Christian, the hero, has to make some heavy decisions.  Even though the film is a bit long by our standards, it held my interest to the end.Then, there is an incredible short added to the DVD which was made in the style of the newsreel features of the time.  It shows what happened to the group that Christian led to Pitcairn Island.  We always wonder what happened to folks after the end of the film, and this fills us in.  What is really strange is the tone of this feature which emphasizes the terrible crime of the mutineers, and the unhappy moody character of Christian.  It's a total flip from the tone of the movie but it is interesting to see actually footage of the inbred people who populated the island at the time of the film.

568911,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B000056BRJ,Robin Simmons,"[6, 6]","This epic naval adventure from 1935 is the jewel in the crown of Louis B. Mayer's MGM from the Thalberg years.  Clark Gable is heroic Master's Mate Fletcher Christian and the great Charles Laughton is tyrannical Captain Bligh.Both actors are at the peak of their considerable screen charisma and dramatic powers.A Best Picture Oscar winner for 1935, the lavish production is based on the true historic trilogy as told in the book of the same name by U.S. Army Air Service pilots and writers Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall.  The film was written and directed by Frank Lloyd on locations as diverse as Tahiti and Catalina.The story is set in 1787.  The 90 foot H.M.S. Bounty sails from Portsmouth for the South Seas in search of Breadfruit trees so slave colonies can have a cheap source of food.  Bligh's harsh discipline ordered on his men for minor and perceived infractions finally led to a full mutiny after they land in Tahiti.Bligh and a few men loyal to him are set loose in the open sea.  But Bligh is rescued and Fletcher along with the surviving mutineers fear eventual arrest and take the Bounty and their Tahitian wives and flee to remote, uninhabited Pitcairn Island where they salvage the Bounty, burn the remains and set up life.  Their descendents live there to this day; it is a strict, religious, inbred, colony with serious issues of abuse.  Sadly, it is not an Edenic paradise.Some trivia: There's a persistent rumor that producer Thalberg specifically cast Gable and Laughton because he believed they would truly despise one another off and on screen since Laughton was gay and Thalberg assumed Gable was a homophobe.  In the film, Laughton appears to briefly glance almost adoringly at Gable, which adds to the perverse tension, almost as if a sadist is looking for a masochist to love.  But I see this as part of Laughton's brilliant acting choices and nothing more.  Sadly, ace cameraman Glenn Strong drowned when a boat capsized during filming in the rough South Pacific.  James Cagney and David Niven both claim to have been extras.  Maybe you can spot them on the sharp BD transfer?There were two earlier cinematic version of this oft-told tale: a silent Australian film from 1916 and In The Wake of the Bounty starring Errol Flynn from 1933.  Lloyd's film was remade in 1962 with Marlon Brando as Christian.  Brando ended up marrying Movita, who was the beautiful, young, Tahitian love interest in the 1935 MGM film!  1984's The Bounty, starring Mel Gibson, was derived from a different account but essentially told the same story.The great looking and sounding Blu-ray 1935 edition comes with no extras beyond a trailer and a vintage, short featurette on Pitcairn Island as it was in 1939.When I was a boy, I met Fletcher Christian 1V(?) who was visiting the U.S. seeking support for his fellow islanders.  He was an old man, but he looked just like engravings of his famous ancestor.  At his urging, I became a pen-pal of a young Pitcairn girl also named Robin.  As I recall, her description of island life was not idyllic or appealing.",4,A CLASSIC FROM THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICAN FILM,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,3073,"['epic', 'naval', 'adventure', '1935', 'jewel', 'crown', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'MGM', 'Thalberg', 'years', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'heroic', 'Master', 'Mate', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'great', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'tyrannical', 'Captain', 'Bligh.Both', 'actors', 'are', 'peak', 'considerable', 'screen', 'charisma', 'dramatic', 'powers.A', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'winner', '1935', 'lavish', 'production', 'based', 'true', 'historic', 'trilogy', 'told', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Air', 'Service', 'pilots', 'writers', 'Charles', 'Nordhoff', 'James', 'Norman', 'Hall', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Lloyd', 'locations', 'as', 'diverse', 'Tahiti', 'Catalina.The', 'story', 'set', '1787', '90', 'foot', 'H.M.S', 'Bounty', 'Portsmouth', 'South', 'Seas', 'search', 'Breadfruit', 'trees', 'so', 'slave', 'colonies', 'can', 'have', 'cheap', 'source', 'food', 'Bligh', 'harsh', 'discipline', 'ordered', 'men', 'minor', 'perceived', 'infractions', 'finally', 'led', 'full', 'mutiny', 'land', 'Tahiti.Bligh', 'few', 'men', 'loyal', 'are', 'set', 'loose', 'open', 'sea', 'Bligh', 'rescued', 'Fletcher', 'surviving', 'mutineers', 'fear', 'eventual', 'arrest', 'take', 'Bounty', 'Tahitian', 'wives', 'flee', 'remote', 'uninhabited', 'Pitcairn', 'Island', 'where', 'salvage', 'Bounty', 'burn', 'remains', 'set', 'up', 'life', 'descendents', 'live', 'there', 'day', 'strict', 'religious', 'inbred', 'colony', 'serious', 'issues', 'abuse', 'Sadly', 'not', 'Edenic', 'paradise.Some', 'trivia', 'persistent', 'rumor', 'producer', 'Thalberg', 'specifically', 'cast', 'Gable', 'Laughton', 'believed', 'would', 'truly', 'despise', 'one', 'off', 'screen', 'Laughton', 'was', 'gay', 'Thalberg', 'assumed', 'Gable', 'was', 'homophobe', 'film', 'Laughton', 'briefly', 'glance', 'almost', 'adoringly', 'Gable', 'perverse', 'tension', 'almost', 'sadist', 'looking', 'masochist', 'love', 'see', 'part', 'Laughton', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'choices', 'nothing', 'more', 'Sadly', 'ace', 'cameraman', 'Glenn', 'Strong', 'drowned', 'when', 'boat', 'capsized', 'filming', 'rough', 'South', 'Pacific', 'James', 'Cagney', 'David', 'Niven', 'claim', 'have', 'been', 'extras', 'Maybe', 'can', 'spot', 'sharp', 'BD', 'transfer', 'were', 'two', 'earlier', 'cinematic', 'version', 'oft-told', 'tale', 'silent', 'Australian', 'film', '1916', 'Wake', 'Bounty', 'starring', 'Errol', 'Flynn', '1933', 'Lloyd', 'film', 'was', 'remade', '1962', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Christian', 'Brando', 'ended', 'up', 'marrying', 'Movita', 'who', 'was', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Tahitian', 'love', 'interest', '1935', 'MGM', 'film', '1984', 'Bounty', 'starring', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'was', 'derived', 'different', 'account', 'essentially', 'told', 'same', 'story.The', 'great', 'looking', 'sounding', 'Blu-ray', '1935', 'edition', 'extras', 'trailer', 'vintage', 'short', 'featurette', 'Pitcairn', 'Island', 'was', '1939.When', 'was', 'boy', 'met', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', '1V', 'who', 'was', 'visiting', 'U.S.', 'seeking', 'support', 'fellow', 'islanders', 'was', 'old', 'man', 'looked', 'just', 'like', 'engravings', 'famous', 'ancestor', 'urging', 'became', 'pen-pal', 'young', 'Pitcairn', 'girl', 'also', 'named', 'Robin', 'recall', 'description', 'island', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'idyllic', 'appealing']",N/A

Most historical movies that win Academy Awards are dull and lifeless filled with facts and not enough humanity. I should have taken more notice of the amazing cast before I jumped to conclusions because this film completely changed my mind.Mutiny on the Bounty is based on a true story. The English ship Bounty is carrying supplies to trade with remote islands far away. Captain Bligh is a horrid man whose tactics involve drastic punishments and toughness. His crew despises him for his torture and starvation routines to the point that they resort to mutiny. Some stay loyal but many retreat back to the exotic islands and then on to Pitcairn Island to hide away from the British government.The story sounds a bit boring but it is rich and exciting. Perhaps the most vital thing is the characters. Clark Gable plays the leader of the mutiny, a strong, decent man. Franchot Tone plays out his best role as the serious and traditional Englishman who stays loyal to the awful captain in spite of his friendship with Gable. Charles Laughton is brilliant as the captain, a wicked and hateful man. Every stern berating and sneer that comes from his character involves the audience more and more until finally some relief comes when he is cast off to sea by his abused crew.The short film called ""Pitcairn Island Today"" is great because it is an example of documentary film making in the 30s and it also shows what happened to the real mutineers. It is a very interesting film although not long or spectacularly done.",5,Great Tale of the Sea,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,1553,"['was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'film', 'Most', 'historical', 'movies', 'win', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'are', 'dull', 'lifeless', 'filled', 'facts', 'not', 'enough', 'humanity', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'notice', 'amazing', 'cast', 'jumped', 'conclusions', 'film', 'completely', 'changed', 'mind.Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'English', 'ship', 'Bounty', 'carrying', 'supplies', 'trade', 'remote', 'islands', 'far', 'away', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'horrid', 'man', 'tactics', 'involve', 'drastic', 'punishments', 'toughness', 'crew', 'torture', 'starvation', 'routines', 'point', 'resort', 'mutiny', 'stay', 'loyal', 'many', 'retreat', 'back', 'exotic', 'islands', 'then', 'Pitcairn', 'Island', 'hide', 'away', 'British', 'government.The', 'story', 'bit', 'boring', 'rich', 'exciting', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'vital', 'thing', 'characters', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'leader', 'mutiny', 'strong', 'decent', 'man', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'out', 'best', 'role', 'serious', 'traditional', 'Englishman', 'who', 'loyal', 'awful', 'captain', 'spite', 'friendship', 'Gable', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'brilliant', 'captain', 'wicked', 'hateful', 'man', 'stern', 'berating', 'sneer', 'character', 'audience', 'more', 'more', 'finally', 'relief', 'when', 'cast', 'sea', 'abused', 'crew.The', 'short', 'film', 'called', 'Pitcairn', 'Island', 'Today', 'great', 'example', 'documentary', 'film', 'making', '30s', 'also', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'mutineers', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'not', 'long', 'spectacularly', 'done']",N/A

While Gable is  perfect as Fletcher Christian and Franchot Tone gives a superb performance  as a midshipman, it's Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh that sets this film  apart.  You'll want to mutiny too.  The ensemble cast is also memorable  (unlike later films), each playing off Bligh's totally disgusting presence.  Stolen cheeses, rancid rations and repeated lashings drive a crew  collected by press-gangs to solicit 1st mate Christian to end their misery.  And he does, casting Bligh adrift and taking the Bounty to Tahiti where  half-naked island girls and a perfect tranquil life compare to Bligh like  heaven to hell.  I shed a tear every viewing during Tone's 'lift their  hearts' speech at the end.  This is a must see classic in every sense.

568920,A12DH4IYORSCP6,B000056BRJ,XKAL,"[2, 3]","Of the three films about the famous ""Bounty"" ship, this version with Clark Gable and Charles Laughton I liked the best. In this version my feelings never swayed as to whom I liked (Gable and the ship mates) and whom I despised (Laughton).Clakr Gable's Fletcher Christian was a light hearted man who was a friend to all. His shipmates looked highly upon him, even though many had been forced to join the long voyage. He was sympathetic with the crew's plight and often times tried his best to protect them from the many vast punishments. When Christian is fully fed up with the majorly unfair antics of Bligh and his mission, he finally decides to take command the Bounty. Christian, once he is in command, never looks back and takes his followers back to paradise on an unknown and uncharted island to live the rest of his days.Captain Bligh is a military man to the bone who demands respect from all, and achieves it through his rough tactics, stern discipline and often times uncaring ways. He leads his ship with the Navy War Rules Book in one hand and a whip in the other. His actions can most certainly be deemed unfair, unjust and most of all harsh. Bligh feels that fear in one's Captain is the only way to lead and earn respect. In a way he almost seems to relish finding ways to ""push a man's buttons"" so he can then take out his Navy Rules War Book and give reason for punishment. His sole reason of mission first, duty second no matter the cost to ones health or life leads to the eventual infamous mutiny.Unlike the other 2 ""Bounty"" films whose Capt. Bligh's at times came across as too sympathetic; Charles Laughton's portrayal of Capt. Bligh came off more aggressive, uncaring and unlikeable. It was easy to hate him and cheer his eventual downfall. A great performance.The other ""Bounty"" films are good and definitely worth watching (especially Marlon Brando), but the best of the lot is this great black and white 1935 version with Gable and Laughton.",4,"The best version of all ""Bounty"" movies...",1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,1967,"['three', 'films', 'famous', 'Bounty', 'ship', 'version', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'liked', 'best', 'version', 'feelings', 'never', 'swayed', 'whom', 'liked', 'Gable', 'ship', 'whom', 'despised', 'Laughton', '.Clakr', 'Gable', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'was', 'light', 'hearted', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'friend', 'shipmates', 'looked', 'highly', 'even', 'many', 'had', 'been', 'forced', 'join', 'long', 'voyage', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'crew', 'plight', 'often', 'times', 'tried', 'best', 'protect', 'many', 'vast', 'punishments', 'When', 'Christian', 'fully', 'fed', 'up', 'majorly', 'unfair', 'antics', 'Bligh', 'mission', 'finally', 'take', 'command', 'Bounty', 'Christian', 'once', 'command', 'never', 'back', 'followers', 'back', 'paradise', 'unknown', 'uncharted', 'island', 'live', 'rest', 'days.Captain', 'Bligh', 'military', 'man', 'bone', 'who', 'respect', 'rough', 'tactics', 'stern', 'discipline', 'often', 'times', 'uncaring', 'ways', 'ship', 'Navy', 'War', 'Rules', 'Book', 'one', 'hand', 'whip', 'other', 'actions', 'can', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'deemed', 'unfair', 'unjust', 'most', 'harsh', 'Bligh', 'fear', 'one', 'Captain', 'only', 'way', 'lead', 'earn', 'respect', 'way', 'almost', 'relish', 'finding', 'ways', 'push', 'man', 'buttons', 'can', 'then', 'take', 'out', 'Navy', 'Rules', 'War', 'Book', 'give', 'reason', 'punishment', 'sole', 'reason', 'mission', 'first', 'duty', 'second', 'matter', 'cost', 'ones', 'health', 'life', 'leads', 'eventual', 'infamous', 'other', '2', 'Bounty', 'films', 'Capt', 'Bligh', 'times', 'came', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'portrayal', 'Capt', 'Bligh', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'aggressive', 'uncaring', 'unlikeable', 'was', 'easy', 'hate', 'cheer', 'eventual', 'downfall', 'great', 'performance.The', 'other', 'Bounty', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'best', 'lot', 'great', 'black', 'white', '1935', 'version', 'Gable', 'Laughton']",N/A
