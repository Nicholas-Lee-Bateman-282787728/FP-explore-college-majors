566281,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0000541TK,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[11, 12]","Beautiful, adj.  1.  Having beauty; delighting the senses and mind.  5.  The ideal of beauty.So says Webster, and given that, Mona Hibbard of Naperville, Illinois does not embody that quality on the inside.  Mona has had a drive to be beautiful and from her pre-teen years, has worked hard, getting her teeth straightened, going to a grace school, and befriending Ruby, who has learned to sew from her grandmother.  From watching beauty pageants on TV, she herself enters a beauty pageant and wins for best costume.  The trouble is, her parents are far from supportive, and she herself shuts them out of her life.  Her mother keeps saying she's getting aggravated from her behaviour, and even when Mona gets a consolation medal reading ""participant,"" she merely says that she didn't get anything.  On the other hand, the egocentric Mona's no angel either.  She has a room with posters full of beauty pageant memorabilia, and a sign on the door reading ""knock first"" When her mother asks her if she wants some pizza, Mona refuses to answer because her mother didn't knock first.Years later, Ruby and Mona are firm friends.  Ruby and her grandmother still help make costumes for Mona, who still has the same dream, and will do anything to get it.  In one scene smacking of black humour and slapstick, she sabotages a rival's equipment when that girl steals Mona's routine and is lucky enough to go first.  This has grave ramifications later on, which I won't reveal.  However, when Mona discovers she's pregnant, it's bad news, because women who are mothers or legal guardians are disqualified from entering the Miss American Miss competition.  But she's so desperate to prove herself beautiful, she has Ruby pose as the mother of her child, a girl named Vanessa, while she becomes her own child's aunt.  This helps her win Miss Illinois, which makes her a contestant for Miss America Miss pageant.  In the meantime, there are the expected public appearances to promote her.However, fate plays a cruel trick on Ruby, leaving Vanessa in Mona's care, something neither is chuffed about.  Mona sees her own daughter as A) an inconvenience, and B) someone to take photos of her to mold her image as a caring, heroic, role model.  But what makes a real role model?  Mona's ""campaign slogan"" is ""empowering America's youth for a brighter America.""  A pity she doesn't embody that ideal toward her own soccer-loving seven year old daughter.In Mallrats Joey Lauren Adams played the smarter advice-giving girlfriend to Claire Forlani.  As Ruby, Adams is the hard-working, grounded, patient friend who works hard to help Mona reach her goal even to the extent of being the mother to Vanessa, and treating her like a real mother would, making this her best role since Chasing Amy.  Hallie Kate Eisenberg (Vanessa) is quite the delight here as the very insightful girl who ends up being more mature and abler than her birth mother.  Indeed, when she asks Mona how come she looks so much like her, it's more than just physical appearance, but more on personality.  One only has to look at the way Mona's own mother treated her to see how Mona treats Vanessa, with lack of sympathy, support, and as somewhat of an inconvenience.  Her other question to Mona, ""where do I belong?""  is something that Mona herself is struggling with, to belong somewhere.  Adams and Eisenberg really make this movie worth it.Actress Sally Fields' feature film directorial debut was much panned by critics, and perhaps it's Minnie Driver's character, who isn't that likeable until the final twenty minutes or so of the movie.  All the same, one is aggravated by her egotistical self-centered behaviour, while at the same time wanting her to not only grow up, as Ruby tells her in a moment of exasperation, but to be, in the words of Webster, to become beautiful.",4,What people will go through to become the most beautiful,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,3825,"['Beautiful', 'adj', '1', 'Having', 'beauty', 'delighting', 'senses', 'mind', '5', 'ideal', 'beauty.So', 'Webster', 'given', 'Mona', 'Hibbard', 'Naperville', 'Illinois', 'not', 'embody', 'quality', 'inside', 'Mona', 'had', 'drive', 'be', 'beautiful', 'pre-teen', 'years', 'worked', 'hard', 'getting', 'teeth', 'straightened', 'going', 'grace', 'school', 'befriending', 'Ruby', 'who', 'learned', 'sew', 'grandmother', 'watching', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'TV', 'herself', 'enters', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'wins', 'best', 'costume', 'trouble', 'parents', 'are', 'far', 'supportive', 'life', 'mother', 'keeps', 'saying', 'getting', 'aggravated', 'behaviour', 'even', 'when', 'Mona', 'consolation', 'medal', 'reading', 'participant', 'merely', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'other', 'hand', 'egocentric', 'Mona', 'angel', 'either', 'room', 'posters', 'full', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'memorabilia', 'sign', 'door', 'reading', 'knock', 'first', 'When', 'mother', 'pizza', 'Mona', 'answer', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'knock', 'first.Years', 'later', 'Ruby', 'Mona', 'are', 'firm', 'friends', 'Ruby', 'grandmother', 'still', 'help', 'make', 'costumes', 'Mona', 'who', 'still', 'same', 'dream', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'one', 'scene', 'smacking', 'black', 'humour', 'slapstick', 'rival', 'equipment', 'when', 'girl', 'Mona', 'routine', 'lucky', 'enough', 'go', 'first', 'grave', 'ramifications', 'later', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'However', 'when', 'Mona', 'pregnant', 'bad', 'news', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'mothers', 'legal', 'guardians', 'are', 'disqualified', 'entering', 'Miss', 'American', 'Miss', 'competition', 'so', 'desperate', 'prove', 'beautiful', 'Ruby', 'pose', 'mother', 'child', 'girl', 'named', 'Vanessa', 'own', 'child', 'aunt', 'win', 'Miss', 'Illinois', 'contestant', 'Miss', 'America', 'Miss', 'pageant', 'meantime', 'are', 'expected', 'public', 'appearances', 'promote', 'her.However', 'fate', 'plays', 'cruel', 'trick', 'Ruby', 'leaving', 'Vanessa', 'Mona', 'care', 'something', 'chuffed', 'Mona', 'own', 'daughter', 'A', 'inconvenience', 'B', 'someone', 'take', 'photos', 'mold', 'image', 'caring', 'heroic', 'role', 'model', 'what', 'real', 'role', 'model', 'Mona', 'campaign', 'slogan', 'empowering', 'America', 'youth', 'brighter', 'America', 'pity', ""n't"", 'embody', 'ideal', 'own', 'soccer-loving', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'daughter.In', 'Mallrats', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'played', 'smarter', 'advice-giving', 'girlfriend', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'Ruby', 'Adams', 'hard-working', 'grounded', 'patient', 'friend', 'who', 'hard', 'help', 'Mona', 'reach', 'goal', 'even', 'extent', 'being', 'mother', 'Vanessa', 'treating', 'real', 'mother', 'would', 'making', 'best', 'role', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Hallie', 'Kate', 'Eisenberg', 'Vanessa', 'quite', 'delight', 'here', 'very', 'insightful', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'mature', 'abler', 'birth', 'mother', 'Indeed', 'when', 'Mona', 'how', 'come', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'physical', 'appearance', 'more', 'personality', 'One', 'only', 'look', 'way', 'Mona', 'own', 'mother', 'treated', 'see', 'how', 'Mona', 'Vanessa', 'lack', 'sympathy', 'support', 'somewhat', 'inconvenience', 'other', 'question', 'Mona', 'where', 'do', 'belong', 'something', 'Mona', 'struggling', 'belong', 'somewhere', 'Adams', 'Eisenberg', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'worth', 'it.Actress', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'feature', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'was', 'much', 'panned', 'critics', 'perhaps', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'likeable', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'same', 'one', 'aggravated', 'egotistical', 'self-centered', 'behaviour', 'same', 'time', 'wanting', 'not', 'only', 'grow', 'up', 'Ruby', 'moment', 'exasperation', 'be', 'words', 'Webster', 'become', 'beautiful']",N/A

566284,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B0000541TK,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 0]","This is Sally Field's directorial debut in a feature film and I give her mixed reviews.  Most of the criticism I have with this film is the way it is directed.  It has a schizophrenic presentation.  On one hand, it is a satire about beauty pageants and the women who compete in them.  On the other, it is a serious story about a young woman trying to overcome her mother's rejection and validate her self worth by winning beauty contests.  Added to the dramatic element is a personal growth epiphany, as the shallow beauty queen comes to terms with life's priorities, embracing her daughter as being more important than her dream.Either of these elements could have worked alone, but together they are incongruous.  The satire trivializes the human-interest story, and the human-interest story weighs down the comedy.  Field's direction, as has been recently true of her acting roles, is best suited for the human-interest angle.  In this film, that is the strongest element.  Despite my being cynical about how predictable and schmaltzy this story was, I still couldn't help being choked up at the end, sappy as it was.  This is to Field's credit as a dramatic director.  However, her attempt to fuse the two discordant elements is misguided and it detracts from the overall entertainment value of the film.The acting is generally good.  Minnie Driver is a far better dramatic actor than she is a comedian and that is reflected in this film.  In the satirical comedy scenes, her acting is very forced and artificial.  In the serious dramatic scenes with Mona's mother and daughter, she is compelling and believable.  Joey Lauren Adams gives a consistently excellent performance as Mona's best friend and Vanessa's surrogate mother.  Adams is lovable, steady and kind, and she effuses sincerity.  This film is a showcase for Hallie Kate Eisenberg, the Media's latest child phenom.  A favorite in commercials and on the Jay Leno show, Eisenberg shows in this film that she can really act, delivering an astonishing performance as Mona's pouty but perceptive child (""I'm seven, I'm not stupid!"").This is a good film for women.  The comedy is not that funny, but the mother-daughter angle will be good for a Kleenex or two.  I rated it a 7/10, including a one-point bonus for the schmaltzy but effective ending.

566293,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0000541TK,Lawyeraau,"[5, 7]","This is a movie about Mona, a girl who dreams of one day winning the Miss American Miss beauty pageant. Growing up in a dysfunctional, white trash sort of family, this is all of which she dreams. With a mother who is totally uninterested in what she does, and a step-father who apparently makes sexual overtures towards her, for which the wily Mona is well prepared to fend, she singlemindedly manages to keep her eye on the prize.As a gawky, lonely preteen, she saves her money to enter local pageants. She also has the great fortune to meet Ruby, a nice girl with a kind hearted grandmother who takes an interest in Mona. Together, they help her achieve her goal. As Mona grows older and blossoms, she manages to meet with more success at pageants, but is not above to resorting to dirty tricks to achieve her goal, as the beauty business is an ugly one.When she becomes unexpectedly pregnant, a state which would disqualify her from entering pageants in the future were she to have a child, Ruby steps up to home plate for her best friend. Mona has the child, Vanessa, whom Ruby raises as her own. Vanessa believes Ruby to be her mother, and Mona to be her aunt, and they all live together. Ruby is the proverbial madonna, and Mona shows no maternal inclination.Ruby works as an attendant in an old age home, bringing home the bacon, while Mona becomes Miss Illinois, still a little girl at heart, wanting the mother who rejected her to come to the Miss American Miss pageant and sit in the family box. By now, Mona is drop dead gorgeous and a talented singer, but self absorbed and conniving, oblivious to the needs and feelings of others.What ultimately happens to Ruby and Mona is ridiculous. Moreover, Ruby and Mona are written as one dimensional characters. Why Ruby sacrifices her entire life to be a virtual door mat, a self effacing, self-sacrificing friend, who appears to get nothing in return from Mona, is not clear. It is hard to believe that Ruby just wants to be needed and used to the extent that she is. The fact that Mona once went to Ruby's aid as a young girl, when she was bothered during a lunchtime fracus by some boys, does not make Ruby's lifetime sacrifice believable. Moreover, when Ruby is falsely imprisoned over a charge of euthenasia, Mona shows no concern for Ruby, but, instead, wonders what is to become of herself, now that Ruby is not around to help her with the Miss American Miss pageant looming on the horizon.Why Mona is friends with Ruby is more clear. Mona gets unconditional acceptance and love from Ruby, something that Mona's own mother failed to give her. Ruby nurtures and supports Mona, while Mona tries to achieve her ultimate goal, which appears to be nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to win her own mother's love and affection. Ruby also mothers Vanessa, as Mona gives no evidence of any maternal feelings. Ruby also does not seem to have any boyfriends, which gives rise to the issue of latent lesbianism as an underlying reason for her passionate devotion to Mona and her needs.During the Miss American Miss pageant, the movie heads south into a downward spiral. Vanessa, attending the pageant, begins suspecting that Mona might, in fact, be her biological mother, due to their ostensible resemblance. While Vanessa is undoubtedly adorable, Mona has a last minute, totally uncharacteristic change of heart that comes out of left field and is simply unbelievable. Her on stage, public acknowledgement of Vanessa as her own daughter, during the pageant she has worked her entire life to win, is ludicrous and inconsistent with what has transpired the entire movie. Her last ditch effort at redemption falls somewhat flat, as she previously showed no sign of any redeeming qualities. Moreover, her winning the title of Miss American Miss in contravention of the rules, because the public appears to approve of her admission, is likewise laughable. Of course, the innocent Ruby is released from prison and not the least disturbed that Vanessa, whom she has raised since infancy and devotedly loved and nurtured, has been reclaimed by Mona without so much as a thank you. It is a patently dishonest move by the writer to try and tie up this uneven movie in one gift wrapped package at the very end.Clearly, the writer wants this this to be a film where all is well that ends well. In this, the writer has failed miserably, as he ends up satisfying no one, with a movie that ends up being neither fish nor fowl. It fails as a satire, as a parody, as a drama, and as a comedy, providing a modicum of entertainment, at best. It is a film to be moderately enjoyed, but not lauded. Too bad the writer lacked the guts to see the movie he began to, what might have been, a very bitter, though more honest, end. It would probably have made for a better movie.Sally Fields, in her directorial debut, does the best she can do with a script that misses the mark. Still, she gets great performances out of the entire cast. Minnie Driver in the title role of Mona, the girl who would be queen, is terrific. Joey Lauren Adams is effective as Ruby, Mona's self-sacrificing, best friend, who apparentlyly believes that greater love has no woman than to lay down own's life for a friend. Hallie Kate Eisenberg is adorable in the role of Vanessa, the precocious daughter. Look also for a small cameo by Kathleen Turner, as the director of a modeling school.",3,THE GIRL WHO WOULD BE QUEEN...,1002585600,"10 9, 2001",2001,5399,"['movie', 'Mona', 'girl', 'who', 'one',

Because of the touching performance by Joey Lauren Adams as Ruby, devoted friend to Minnie Driver's Mona. Joey made Ruby a sweet, kind, generous, admirable young woman who gave so much to others and received so little in return. Each of Joey's performances has been special in its own way, but her role in ""Beautiful"" tops them all in my book. It made my heart ache to see Ruby working so hard to make a home for Mona and little Vanessa, and make a dream for Mona, and make life more comfortable for the elders at the home where Ruby worked as a nurse. And what happened to her in return? Mona constantly demanded ""More! More! More!"" ... even after poor Ruby was jailed for a crime she didn't commit. Yet Ruby remained steadfast, even cheering Mona from the TV room at the slammer come Pageant Night. ""Beautiful"" had a happy enough ending, I suppose, as Ruby was exonerated and released from custody. I hoped that after the closing credits, Ruby started getting all of the wonderful things she deserved so much ... a trip to a special place of her choosing, a special guy (or girl if that's her orientation) in her life ... or just having Mona cook her a nice meal, draw her a bubble bath, give her a massage and say, ""I don't deserve you as a friend.

566299,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B0000541TK,Reviewer,"[2, 3]","Sometimes wanting something so badly can bind a person to the fact that they already possess that which is worth so much more than what they desire.  But obsession forges the path of narrow-mindedness and erects walls that block the peripheral vision, preventing recognition of that which really matters, all of which a young woman may or may not discover in ""Beautiful,"" directed by Sally Field, and starring Minnie Driver.  Growing up in a somewhat less than loving home, Mona (Driver) channels all of her energy into making herself beautiful, determined to win the beauty contests that will lead her to her ultimate goal, to one day be crowned Miss American Miss.  Along the way, however, in her single-minded pursuit of the crown, she loses sight of the fact that beauty must come from within as well as without.  Luckily for Mona, she has a devoted friend, Ruby (Joey Lauren Adams), who manages to keep her on track for as long as she can.  But a teenaged pregnancy suddenly puts a damper on Mona's plans; but even in this Ruby comes to her rescue, and for the next seven years raises Mona's daughter, Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), as her own, which allows Mona to pursue her dream.  Field proves she has what it takes as a director, as she delivers her story with sensitivity, while avoiding any maudlin sentimentality that would've sunk a movie like this right out of the chute.  Happily, she presents it all with a straightforward, realistic tone and develops the characters in perfect sync with the time line of the plot, all of which makes for that necessary connection with the audience.  And she perfectly treads a fine line with Mona that is integral to the success of the film.  In light of the disregard Mona affords Ruby and Vanessa, it would be easy to dislike her out-of-hand; but Field takes great care to impart that side of Mona that elicits just enough sympathy to keep the ship afloat.  It would be so easy to judge her and give up on her, but the way Field handles it, it's as if she's saying, ""No, don't give up on her just yet.  Wait and see...""  And so, you wait and see, and in the end, it pays off.  There are some memorable performances in this film, beginning with Colleen Rennison, who portrays the young Mona.  Physically, they could not have found anyone better for this part (as is evidenced when Driver takes over; the resemblance is remarkable).  But more than that, she captures the same emotional essence and attitudes of the character that Driver brings to Mona, and the fact that both actresses so accurately and believably maintain that same ""sense"" of her throughout the film is extraordinary, as is the seamless transition from from the young to the adult Mona.  it's exceptional work by Driver, Rennison and Field that deserves singular recognition.  The lion's share of the Mona character of course goes to Driver, who is-- quite simply-- terrific in the part.  She has a way of making you know that there is more to Mona than the shallow exterior that is so apparent, and as the film progresses the internal changes she undergoes are so gradual, and presented by Driver with such subtle nuance, that it makes the character entirely believable.  And regardless of the outcome of all that follows, ultimately you will be glad you took the time to get to know her.  Adams gives a notable performance as well, playing Ruby with a sincerity that makes her the friend everyone should be lucky enough to have, and Eisenberg, as Vanessa, proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that there is much more to her than that which is indicated by the part that is her claim to fame, that of the ""Pepsi Girl.""  Even at her tender age, she lends her character the personality, attitude and maturity that really makes it click.  The supporting cast includes Kathleen Turner (Verna), Leslie Stefanson (Joyce), Bridgette Wilson (Lorna, ""Miss Texas""), Kathleen Robertson (Wanda, ""Miss Tennessee""), Michael McKean (Lance), Gary Collins (Pageant Host), Linda Hart (Nedra), Brent Briscoe (Lurdy) and Jacqueline Steiger (Young Ruby).  An entertaining, engaging film, ""Beautiful"" is well made and delivered, and provides some insight into the human condition.

566301,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000541TK,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 6]","One thing is for certain:  ""Beautiful"" is one of the screwiest, messiest excuses for a movie to have come down the pike in a very long time.  God only knows what writer Jon Bernstein and director Sally Field were hoping to achieve in this idiotic tale of a young woman's obsession with winning beauty pageants at any and all costs - but whatever it was, the film that resulted could hardly have been more lacking in humor, taste or point.  One suspects that satire was probably the ultimate goal, but for that a filmmaker has to be able to demonstrate at least a modicum of discipline and control over style, tone and substance.  This film goes flying out in all directions at once.  One moment it is indulging in broad caricature and buffoonish slapstick, followed the next moment by searing drama and schmaltzy sentimentality.  Bernstein and Fields keep throwing everything but the kitchen sink into the mix - neglectful parents, pedophilia, obnoxious children, euthanasia, murder charges - in the futile hope that somehow it will all result in a knee-slapping comedy.  Maybe they felt that if they just kept adding elements, regardless of how disparate and contradictory they happened to be, we simply wouldn't notice the pointlessness and impossibility of the whole project.  Nice try but no cigar.Minnie Driver stars as the conniving Mona, the candidate least likely ever to be chosen Miss Congeniality.  Obsessed from childhood with winning a contest, she spends most of her time trying to sabotage the chances of her many rivals.  If the film had any real nerve, it would have gone all the way with this character and made her irredeemably ruthless, like Reese Witherspoon's irredeemable schemer in ""Election.""  Instead, the script goes soft on Mona, trying to mitigate and justify her cruelty and self-centered whininess by showing what a miserable childhood she had at the hands of her white trash mother and stepfather.  Real satire can only be biting and effective if it demonstrates the courage to stick to its guns.  ""Beautiful"" keeps winking at the audience, telling us it isn't really serious about what it's attacking, assuring us that all will be well in the end.  The detrimental effect on the film is thus two-fold:  we hate Mona for being such an obnoxious crybaby and we hate her for turning all mushy in the end.  This is what happens when sloppy filmmakers attempt such a challenging task as satire.This is particularly borne out in the fact that the various plot elements seem as if they belonged not only in different movies but on different planets.  Do the filmmakers really think it is appropriate to inject the serious issues of euthanasia and false imprisonment into the trivial context of a wan little comedy about beauty pageants?  The grinding of tonal gears that results from this mismatch brings the whole movie to a fatal reckoning early on.Driver does her best with an unappealing role, but Hallie Kate Eisenberg, as Mona's ""illegitimate"" daughter, ranges from teeth-grindingly cutesy to precociously obnoxious.  Perhaps, it's all that overexposure she received in those soda commercials.The hopelessness of the whole enterprise is underlined by the ludicrousness of the film's fairy tale ending, which defies credibility on so many levels that all we can do is throw up our hands in dismay and disgust.  Not that it matters much in the long run.  Our hands have been in that position from the very start anyway.",2,hopeless misfire,995846400,"07 23, 2001",2001,3449,"['One', 'thing', 'certain', 'Beautiful', 'one', 'screwiest', 'messiest', 'excuses', 'movie', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'pike', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'God', 'only', 'what', 'writer', 'Jon', 'Bernstein', 'director', 'Sally', 'Field', 'were', 'hoping', 'achieve', 'idiotic', 'tale', 'young', 'woman', 'obsession', 'winning', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'costs', 'was', 'film', 'resulted', 'could', 'hardly', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'lacking', 'humor', 'taste', 'point', 'One', 'satire', 'was', 'probably', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'filmmaker', 'be', 'able', 'demonstrate', 'least', 'modicum', 'discipline', 'control', 'style', 'tone', 'substance', 'film', 'flying', 'out', 'directions', 'once', 'One', 'moment', 'indulging', 'broad', 'caricature', 'buffoonish', 'slapstick', 'followed', 'next', 'moment', 'searing', 'drama', 'schmaltzy', 'sentimentality', 'Bernstein', 'Fields', 'keep', 'throwing', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'mix', 'neglectful', 'parents', 'pedophilia', 'obnoxious', 'children', 'euthanasia', 'murder', 'charges', 'futile', 'hope', 'somehow', 'will', 'result', 'knee-slapping', 'comedy', 'Maybe', 'felt', 'just', 'kept', 'adding', 'elements', 'regardless', 'how', 'disparate', 'contradictory', 'happened', 'be', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'pointlessness', 'impossibility', 'whole', 'project', 'Nice', 'try', 'cigar.Minnie', 'Driver', 'conniving', 'Mona', 'candidate', 'least', 'likely', 'ever', 'be', 'chosen', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'Obsessed', 'childhood', 'winning', 'contest', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'sabotage', 'chances', 'many', 'rivals', 'film', 'had', 'real', 'nerve', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'character', 'made', 'irredeemably', 'ruthless', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'irredeemable', 'schemer', 'Election', 'Instead', 'script', 'soft', 'Mona', 'trying', 'mitigate', 'justify', 'cruelty', 'self-centered', 'whininess', 'showing', 'what', 'miserable', 'childhood', 'had', 'hands', 'white', 'trash', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'Real', 'satire', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'biting', 'effective', 'courage', 'stick', 'guns', 'Beautiful', 'winking', 'audience', 'telling', ""n't"", 'really', 'serious', 'what', 'attacking', 'assuring', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'end', 'detrimental', 'effect', 'film', 'thus', 'two-fold', 'hate', 'Mona', 'being', 'such', 'obnoxious', 'crybaby', 'hate', 'turning', 'mushy', 'end', 'what', 'when', 'sloppy', 'filmmakers', 'attempt', 'challenging', 'task', 'satire.This', 'particularly', 'borne', 'out', 'fact', 'various', 'plot', 'elements', 'seem', 'belonged', 'not', 'only', 'different', 'movies', 'different', 'planets', 'Do', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'think', 'appropriate', 'inject', 'serious', 'issues', 'euthanasia', 'false', 'imprisonment', 'trivial', 'context', 'wan', 'little', 'comedy', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'grinding', 'tonal', 'gears', 'results', 'mismatch', 'whole', 'movie', 'fatal', 'reckoning', 'early', 'on.Driver', 'best', 'unappealing', 'role', 'Hallie', 'Kate', 'Eisenberg', 'Mona', 'illegitimate', 'daughter', 'teeth-grindingly', 'cutesy', 'precociously', 'obnoxious', 'Perhaps', 'overexposure', 'received', 'soda', 'commercials.The', 'hopelessness', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'underlined', 'ludicrousness', 'film', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending', 'credibility', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'can', 'do', 'throw', 'up', 'hands', 'dismay', 'disgust', 'Not', 'much', 'long', 'run', 'hands', 'have', 'been', 'position', 'very', 'start', 'anyway']",N/A
566302,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000541TK,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 16]","Comparison is inevitable.  We had a biting satire of ""Drop Dead Gorgeous.""  We had lovely Sandra in ""Miss Congeniality.""  And we have Sally Field's director debut film starring Minnie Driver and Hallie Kate Eisenberg.  You think the chances are it ends up with an enjoyable film.  The result turns out to be ... No, it didn't.The story's basic premise -- a mother who hides the fact that she has a daughter, fearing to have her entry into ""Miss America Miss"" beauty contest disqualified -- clearly comes from famous Vanessa L. William's case, in which she had to resign her crown because of her previous photos taken before her becoming Miss America.  (See the daughter of Minnie Driver character is called ""Vanessa,"" and once Ms. Williams's name is briefly mentioned in the film.)  The writer expanded the idea, I imagine, and made a heroine of the film, who, in order to get the crown of the beauty pageant, denies her motherly emotions to her own daughter, giving the daughter to her best friend's hand, and pretending that she (her friend) is the real mother.  Oh, no, please.Moreover, the protagonist, with which we are supposed to sympathize, desperately chases the crown.  Real desperate.  For all Minnie Driver's charming smile and comic talent, and Joey Lauren Adams's good-natured portrayal of her friend, the film cannot be saved from being totally pathetic.  Yes, I say  frankly, I really disliked her.  I am ready to cheer Ms. Williams, but as for the heroine of ""Beautiful,"" I never felt like that.  And though Ms. Eisenburg is certainly cute, and was good in films like ""Paulie,"" here, it seems, she is only allowed to irritate us by yelling, running, jumping and kicking a ball.All these problems come from the director.  I don't want to be harsh, but it is true.  We have these able cast, plus Kathleen Turner, Brdgitte L. Wilson, and even Ali Landry (real-life Miss America, but Amerians may remember Doritos Chips), but the film is often unpleasant, and doesn't seem to know what it wants to do.  There are some funny scenes, but the film cannot fully use those good moments to carry on the potential power long, and the conclusion is too predictable.  We know from the beginning that they should not exclude her from the contest on the ground that she has a child -- you know, it is 21th century.  But the film's ending treats us as if we don't know that, to make the film very patronizing.Maybe I should shut my mouth, and enjoy Minnie Driver's hectic journey to the crown.  But I could not.  The best moment of the film comes when Minnie Driver greatly surprises us by singing ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" on stage with splendid voice.  That scene truely shines, but the film is then almost over.",2,Very Annoying For All Ms. Driver's Charming Song and Smile,1013904000,"02 17, 2002",2002,2717,"['Comparison', 'inevitable', 'had', 'biting', 'satire', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'had', 'lovely', 'Sandra', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'have', 'Sally', 'Field', 'director', 'debut', 'film', 'starring', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Hallie', 'Kate', 'Eisenberg', 'think', 'chances', 'are', 'up', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'result', 'out', 'be', 'No', 'story', 'basic', 'premise', 'mother', 'who', 'fact', 'daughter', 'fearing', 'have', 'entry', 'Miss', 'America', 'Miss', 'beauty', 'contest', 'disqualified', 'clearly', 'famous', 'Vanessa', 'L.', 'William', 'case', 'had', 'resign', 'crown', 'previous', 'photos', 'taken', 'becoming', 'Miss', 'America', 'See', 'daughter', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'character', 'called', 'Vanessa', 'once', 'Ms.', 'Williams', 'name', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'film', 'writer', 'expanded', 'idea', 'imagine', 'made', 'heroine', 'film', 'who', 'order', 'get', 'crown', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'motherly', 'emotions', 'own', 'daughter', 'giving', 'daughter', 'best', 'friend', 'hand', 'pretending', 'friend', 'real', 'mother', 'Oh', 'please.Moreover', 'protagonist', 'are', 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'desperately', 'crown', 'Real', 'desperate', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'charming', 'smile', 'comic', 'talent', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'good-natured', 'portrayal', 'friend', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'saved', 'being', 'totally', 'pathetic', 'Yes', 'say', 'frankly', 'really', 'disliked', 'am', 'ready', 'cheer', 'Ms.', 'Williams', 'heroine', 'Beautiful', 'never', 'felt', 'Ms.', 'Eisenburg', 'certainly', 'cute', 'was', 'good', 'films', 'Paulie', 'here', 'only', 'allowed', 'irritate', 'yelling', 'running', 'jumping', 'kicking', 'ball.All', 'problems', 'come', 'director', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'harsh', 'true', 'have', 'able', 'cast', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Brdgitte', 'L.', 'Wilson', 'even', 'Ali', 'Landry', 'real-life', 'Miss', 'America', 'Amerians', 'may', 'remember', 'Doritos', 'Chips', 'film', 'often', 'unpleasant', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'use', 'good', 'moments', 'carry', 'potential', 'power', 'long', 'conclusion', 'too', 'predictable', 'know', 'beginning', 'should', 'not', 'exclude', 'contest', 'ground', 'child', 'know', '21th', 'century', 'film', 'ending', 'treats', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'make', 'film', 'very', 'patronizing.Maybe', 'should', 'shut', 'mouth', 'enjoy', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'hectic', 'journey', 'crown', 'could', 'not', 'best', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'greatly', 'singing', 'Will', 'Love', 'Me', 'Tomorrow', 'stage', 'splendid', 'voice', 'scene', 'truely', 'film', 'then', 'almost']",N/A
