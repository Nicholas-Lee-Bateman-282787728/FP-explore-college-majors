365213,A2QJC8A2HN5FWW,6303234844,718 Session,"[0, 1]","I got the VHS of this concert a couple of years ago.  The DVD is a vast improvement in almost every way.For me, this tour was one of the best PG concerts I've ever seen.  The ""Growing Up"" tour was incredible, but I think this show had better showmanship and activity--and also a bit of a better selection of songs.Really, who is a better showman out there than Peter Gabriel?  I don't think any other act--with the possible exception of Pink Floyd/Roger Waters or *possibly* Tool--approaches a concert as theater to the extent that PG does.  It isn't just the songs, it is an artistic push for mood, costume, lighting, and *story*.  On this tour, Peter and band use two stages (one male, one female) connected by a catwalk and moving sidewalks.The extras are also great with a ""making of"" doc that has Peter deconstructing the show and the sets.  Rather than pure self-promotion, this segment really gives you a feel for all of the blood, sweat, and tears that went into creating this show.  There's also a really great remix of ""Steam"", a pretty neat timelapse of setting up and striking the show, as well as previewing ""Growing Up"".My one complaint about this DVD is that it is pretty clear at least some of Peter's vocals were re-recorded in studio.  There's no breathing (PG spends about a third of the concert in motion), no mic fades, and the audio doesn't always match up with the video.  This is pretty typical of PG who apparently did the same for the VHS version, the Secret World CD and Peter Gabriel Plays Live CDs (he said as much in the ""Plays Live"" liner notes).  For me it is maddening.  I've seen PG live 6 times now (soon to be 7 or 8 as the Growing Up 2003 tour shapes up) and I have never heard a missed note or a crack.  Even if such a thing should show up, it's a LIVE performance, isn't it?  The perfectionist leanings that PG has are admirable, but I believe this goes to far and takes away from his live recordings.Most people don't seem to mind this, but I wanted to point it out.To those of you complaining about the video compared to the VHS version, I have both and I've watched them closely:  The VHS is full-screen and cuts off the edges.  The DVD is not a cropping.  The picture in the DVD is a little darker, but a whole lot sharper.  I'm no expert but I believe that when the VHS edit was mastered, it was ""sweetened"" to make it look more like video: a little more colorful and brighter but a little more distorted.  This looks more like film.As for the audio, you can't compare the two: the VHS comes nowhere near the quality of the DVD.  I can't compare it to the LD version, but the DVD mix is much more discrete and allows for a better feel for the full range of percussion--though Tony Levin fans might want to turn the bass up a bit; I think the low range was de-emphasized a bit to keep it from taking over.Overall, this is an excellent DVD and well worth buying even if you've already bought the VHS.  If only more acts put as much effort into their live performances as Peter does.Enjoy!",5,Outstanding,1050969600,"04 22, 2003",2003,3030,"['got', 'VHS', 'concert', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'DVD', 'vast', 'improvement', 'almost', 'way.For', 'tour', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'PG', 'concerts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Growing', 'Up', 'tour', 'was', 'incredible', 'think', 'show', 'had', 'better', 'showmanship', 'activity', 'also', 'bit', 'better', 'selection', 'songs.Really', 'who', 'better', 'showman', 'there', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'act', 'possible', 'exception', 'Pink', 'Floyd/Roger', 'Waters', '*possibly*', 'Tool', 'concert', 'theater', 'extent', 'PG', ""n't"", 'just', 'songs', 'artistic', 'push', 'mood', 'costume', 'lighting', '*story*', 'tour', 'Peter', 'band', 'use', 'two', 'stages', 'one', 'male', 'one', 'female', 'connected', 'catwalk', 'moving', 'sidewalks.The', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'making', 'doc', 'Peter', 'deconstructing', 'show', 'sets', 'Rather', 'pure', 'self-promotion', 'segment', 'really', 'feel', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'went', 'creating', 'show', 'also', 'really', 'great', 'remix', 'Steam', 'pretty', 'neat', 'timelapse', 'setting', 'up', 'striking', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'previewing', 'Growing', 'Up', 'one', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'clear', 'least', 'Peter', 'vocals', 'were', 're-recorded', 'studio', 'breathing', 'PG', 'third', 'concert', 'motion', 'mic', 'fades', 'audio', ""n't"", 'always', 'match', 'up', 'video', 'pretty', 'typical', 'PG', 'who', 'apparently', 'did', 'same', 'VHS', 'version', 'Secret', 'World', 'CD', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'Plays', 'Live', 'CDs', 'said', 'as', 'much', 'Plays', 'Live', 'liner', 'notes', 'maddening', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'PG', 'live', '6', 'times', 'now', 'soon', 'be', '7', '8', 'Growing', 'Up', '2003', 'tour', 'up', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'missed', 'note', 'crack', 'Even', 'such', 'thing', 'should', 'show', 'up', 'LIVE', 'performance', ""n't"", 'perfectionist', 'leanings', 'PG', 'are', 'admirable', 'believe', 'far', 'away', 'live', 'recordings.Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'wanted', 'point', 'complaining', 'video', 'compared', 'VHS', 'version', 'have', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'closely', 'VHS', 'full-screen', 'cuts', 'edges', 'DVD', 'not', 'cropping', 'picture', 'DVD', 'little', 'darker', 'whole', 'lot', 'sharper', ""'m"", 'expert', 'believe', 'when', 'VHS', 'edit', 'was', 'mastered', 'was', 'sweetened', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'video', 'little', 'more', 'colorful', 'brighter', 'little', 'more', 'distorted', 'more', 'film.As', 'audio', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'VHS', 'nowhere', 'quality', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'LD', 'version', 'DVD', 'mix', 'much', 'more', 'discrete', 'better', 'feel', 'full', 'range', 'percussion', 'Tony', 'Levin', 'fans', 'might', 'want', 'turn', 'bass', 'up', 'bit', 'think', 'low', 'range', 'was', 'de-emphasized', 'bit', 'keep', 'taking', 'over.Overall', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', 'even', ""'ve"", 'already', 'bought', 'VHS', 'only', 'more', 'acts', 'put', 'much', 'effort', 'live', 'performances', 'Peter', 'does.Enjoy']",N/A

365216,A1EGRI1JQEQNKA,6303234844,Amazon Customer,"[52, 53]","This has been on my personal hi-def wishlist since HD was invented. Overall I'm very happy with the presentation, and relieved not to be disappointed after the long wait. I'll break my specific observations down by category:Performance: In short, if you've even heard of Peter Gabriel, you don't need me telling you this is him at his peak. Not that I don't love the more recent work, and see the artistic merit, but he has the fire here, and it's blazing up strong. He assembled an amazing cast of musicians for these shows, and Paula Cole in particular is gorgeous and gives as good as she gets vocally all the way through playing against Gabriel (a true achievment for any singer). It just doesn't get better than this...Video: A lot of work was apparently invested in cleaning and digitizing the original 16mm film. There is not a scratch or speck of dirt to be seen. Overall it looks great. There's a little image softness especially in longer shots, but it's largely due to the hazy auditorium environment as much as the small image size of the base film stock. A small amount of grain is noticable now and again but that's to be expected with the 16mm original. Colors are vibrant and beautifully saturated.Audio: There are two audio tracks, an LPCM stereo track and a DTS-HD surround track. Neither is a bad choice for listening. The LPCM track is clean and smooth. The DTS-HD adds some very restrained ambience effects, but nothing that becomes distracting. Personally I slightly prefer the stereo track, but it's a close call.Overall I consider this BD a bargain at the price, and am thrilled to finally have a superior version in my concert library.Track listing:Come Talk to MeSteamAcross the RiverSlow MarimbasShaking the TreeBlood of EdenSan JacintoKiss That FrogWashing of the WaterSolsbury HillDigging in the DirtSledgehammerSecret WorldDon't Give UpIn You EyesBonus Tracks:Red RainSteam (remixed ""quiet"" version paired with tour photo montage)The Rhythm of the Heat (New Blood Live performance)Special Features:Behind the Scenes documentaryTime Lapse film of stage setup",5,Still amazing nearly two decades on...,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,2087,"['been', 'personal', 'hi-def', 'wishlist', 'HD', 'was', 'invented', 'Overall', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'presentation', 'relieved', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'long', 'wait', ""'ll"", 'break', 'specific', 'observations', 'down', 'category', 'Performance', 'short', ""'ve"", 'even', 'heard', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'telling', 'peak', 'Not', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'more', 'recent', 'work', 'see', 'artistic', 'merit', 'fire', 'here', 'blazing', 'up', 'strong', 'assembled', 'amazing', 'cast', 'musicians', 'shows', 'Paula', 'Cole', 'particular', 'gorgeous', 'as', 'good', 'vocally', 'way', 'playing', 'Gabriel', 'true', 'achievment', 'singer', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'Video', 'lot', 'work', 'was', 'apparently', 'invested', 'cleaning', 'digitizing', 'original', '16mm', 'film', 'not', 'scratch', 'speck', 'dirt', 'be', 'seen', 'Overall', 'great', 'little', 'image', 'softness', 'especially', 'longer', 'shots', 'largely', 'due', 'hazy', 'auditorium', 'environment', 'as', 'much', 'small', 'image', 'size', 'base', 'film', 'stock', 'small', 'amount', 'grain', 'noticable', 'now', 'again', 'be', 'expected', '16mm', 'original', 'Colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'beautifully', 'saturated.Audio', 'are', 'two', 'audio', 'tracks', 'LPCM', 'stereo', 'track', 'DTS-HD', 'surround', 'track', 'bad', 'choice', 'listening', 'LPCM', 'track', 'clean', 'smooth', 'DTS-HD', 'very', 'restrained', 'ambience', 'effects', 'nothing', 'distracting', 'Personally', 'slightly', 'prefer', 'stereo', 'track', 'close', 'call.Overall', 'consider', 'BD', 'bargain', 'price', 'am', 'thrilled', 'finally', 'have', 'superior', 'version', 'concert', 'library.Track', 'listing', 'Come', 'Talk', 'MeSteamAcross', 'RiverSlow', 'MarimbasShaking', 'TreeBlood', 'EdenSan', 'JacintoKiss', 'FrogWashing', 'WaterSolsbury', 'HillDigging', 'DirtSledgehammerSecret', 'WorldDo', ""n't"", 'Give', 'UpIn', 'EyesBonus', 'Tracks', 'Red', 'RainSteam', 'remixed', 'quiet', 'version', 'paired', 'tour', 'photo', 'montage', 'Rhythm', 'Heat', 'New', 'Blood', 'Live', 'performance', 'Special', 'Features', 'Scenes', 'documentaryTime', 'Lapse', 'film', 'stage', 'setup']",N/A

You could clearly hear Peter Gabriel, and he sounded great (which compared to the ""Growing Up"" concert DVD, he always sounded far away and faded out).  All the band members, including Gabriel were very energitic and vibrant!  This was a concert that I wished I would have seen with my own eyes.  All the song selections that Gabriel made for this concert were either his better and livelier songs, such as Sledgehammer, Sulsbury Hill, and Shaking the Tree, or they were at least pleasant and melodic, and enjoyable to listen to.  From beginning to end, this was a very entertaining DVD.  I played this for several friends who were not into Gabriel, and one even said that he would love to purchase the dvd.

365219,A2YAABMT80RLYA,6303234844,Ben Rowland,"[0, 1]","I was first introduced to Peter Gabriel's live shows on his 2002/2003 &quot;Growing Up&quot; tour, being too young to have caught him on his previous tours 10 years earlier. His concerts are fantastic, combining art, music, and theatrics (and often acrobatics). &quot;Secret World Live&quot; was his 1994 concert in support of his &quot;Us&quot; album, and is one of the finest concert films ever released. The DVD release is great, save for some technical problems.The highlight of the concert were &quot;Come Talk To Me&quot;, which has Gabriel emerging from a phone booth and he inches towards backing vocalist Paula Cole, &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; (a classic!), and &quot;Shaking The Tree&quot;. Most, if not all, of the songs are book-ended by African vocals and tribal beats. It is beautiful how they meshed together the songs. With strong musicians (his longtime bassist Tony Levin especially) and backing vocals from Paula Cole (who has had some fleeting success in the mid-90s as a solo artist) and Shankar on violin and vocals makes the sound well rounded and pleasing to the ears. Gabriel himself is always an energetic and spirited presence, dressed like Han Solo and doing his odd dances and mimes throughout the show.While the concert is fantastic, the DVD release has a few problems with the picture and sound. The picture is grainy at times, which would be most noticeable to people with big screen, plasma, or projection television sets. While the DVD boasts &quot;Re-Mixed and Re-Mastered&quot;, but it appears that the source material was a bit frayed. The picture is not horrible, but it could be much better, considering the capabilities of the DVD format. The sound is mostly well mastered, but there are times when the backing vocals are muted, making them almost indistinct. The bass also fades out on occasion, but this is less noticeable and therefore less of an inconvenience. These are not serious problems that would prevent me from recommending the DVD, but DVD purists would definitely find things to complaint about.The supplements are nothing spectacular. There is an insubstantial &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette, which is good for a one-off viewing. There is also a nice promo for Gabriel's &quot;:Growing Up&quot; tour, where he goes into detail about the setup of his new concerts, including the giant hamster bubble that anyone who has seen his recent concerts loves. My favorite supplement, though I don't know why, is the time-lapse of a concert in Berlin, Germany. Over the course if a minute, we see the stages being set up in an empty arena, the full concert, and everything being dismantled, packed up, and shipped out. It is a lot of fun.&quot;Secret World Live&quot; is a fantastic concert film that cannot be ruined, even by a sub-standard video transfer and iffy sound quality. It contains some of his best music during one of his best concerts. Highly recommended.",4,Pitfalls of the DVD transfer didn't ruin the concert for me.,1063497600,"09 14, 2003",2003,2914,"['was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'live', 'shows', '2002/2003', 'quot', 'Growing', 'Up', 'quot', 'tour', 'being', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'caught', 'previous', 'tours', '10', 'years', 'earlier', 'concerts', 'are', 'fantastic', 'combining', 'art', 'music', 'theatrics', 'often', 'acrobatics', 'quot', 'Secret', 'World', 'Live', 'quot', 'was', '1994', 'concert', 'support', 'quot', 'Us', 'quot', 'one', 'finest', 'concert', 'films', 'ever', 'released', 'DVD', 'release', 'great', 'save', 'technical', 'problems.The', 'highlight', 'concert', 'were', 'quot', 'Come', 'Talk', 'Me', 'quot', 'Gabriel', 'emerging', 'phone', 'booth', 'towards', 'backing', 'vocalist', 'Paula', 'Cole', 'quot', 'Solsbury', 'Hill', 'quot', 'classic', 'quot', 'Shaking', 'Tree', 'quot', 'Most', 'not', 'songs', 'are', 'book-ended', 'African', 'vocals', 'tribal', 'beats', 'beautiful', 'how', 'meshed', 'together', 'songs', 'strong', 'musicians', 'longtime', 'bassist', 'Tony', 'Levin', 'especially', 'backing', 'vocals', 'Paula', 'Cole', 'who', 'had', 'fleeting', 'success', 'mid-90s', 'solo', 'artist', 'Shankar', 'violin', 'vocals', 'sound', 'well', 'rounded', 'pleasing', 'ears', 'Gabriel', 'always', 'energetic', 'spirited', 'presence', 'dressed', 'Han', 'Solo', 'doing', 'odd', 'dances', 'mimes', 'show.While', 'concert', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'release', 'few', 'problems', 'picture', 'sound', 'picture', 'grainy', 'times', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'noticeable', 'people', 'big', 'screen', 'plasma', 'projection', 'television', 'sets', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Re-Mixed', 'Re-Mastered', 'quot', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'bit', 'frayed', 'picture', 'not', 'horrible', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'considering', 'capabilities', 'DVD', 'format', 'sound', 'mostly', 'well', 'mastered', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'backing', 'vocals', 'are', 'muted', 'making', 'almost', 'indistinct', 'bass', 'also', 'out', 'occasion', 'less', 'noticeable', 'therefore', 'less', 'inconvenience', 'are', 'not', 'serious', 'problems', 'would', 'prevent', 'recommending', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'purists', 'would', 'definitely', 'find', 'things', 'complaint', 'about.The', 'supplements', 'are', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'insubstantial', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'featurette', 'good', 'one-off', 'viewing', 'also', 'nice', 'promo', 'Gabriel', 'quot', 'Growing', 'Up', 'quot', 'tour', 'where', 'detail', 'setup', 'new', 'concerts', 'including', 'giant', 'hamster', 'bubble', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'recent', 'concerts', 'loves', 'favorite', 'supplement', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'time-lapse', 'concert', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'course', 'minute', 'see', 'stages', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'empty', 'arena', 'full', 'concert', 'everything', 'being', 'dismantled', 'packed', 'up', 'shipped', 'out', 'lot', 'fun.', 'quot', 'Secret', 'World', 'Live', 'quot', 'fantastic', 'concert', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ruined', 'even', 'sub-standard', 'video', 'transfer', 'iffy', 'sound', 'quality', 'best', 'music', 'one', 'best', 'concerts', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

However, they will be thrilled to learn that the Grammy Award winning film has been fully restored remastered and is now being made available in DVD and Blu-ray. Filmed in Modena, Italy during a two night stop in November 1993 during the Secret World Live tour in support of the ""Us"" album, the show is elaborately presented and choreographed in ways that you can only expect from a Peter Gabriel production.Backing Gabriel on the film is David Rhodes on guitar, Tony Levin on bass,  Jean Claude Naimro on keyboards and vocals, Manu Katche on drums, the lovely Paula Cole assisting on vocals, Shankar on violin and vocals), Levon Minassian on the doudouk and guests Papa Wemba and Molokai.  Together, they punch out some of Gabriel's best work up to that point, including Boomerocity favorites Steam, Sledgehammer and Secret World, as well as Don't Give Up, In Your Eyes, Digging In The Dirt, and Shaking The Tree, along with nine other great tunes..There's also a ton of bonus features that are included. Red Rain was not included in the original film and is now included as an extra for the first time. The DVD/Blu-ray also offers time-lapse film of the incredible stage construction. And, if that isn't enough for you, there's also a featurette on the making of the Secret World Live film that includes interviews and behind the scenes footage.The remastered Secret World Live DVD/Blu-ray is a must have disc for Peter Gabriel fans the world over.

365229,AQKLGDNJJAFPK,6303234844,dj,"[0, 0]","This is possibly one of Peter Gabriel's most engaging tours, containing samples from the then-current release ""Us"" and also reaching far into his back catalog as well. Gabriel's stage presence is undisputed in the industry, and it shows nicely on this DVD despite being nearly twenty years old now. The supporting musicians surrounding Gabriel likewise display their virtuosity in flawless execution. This concert is a relic and I consider it a privilege to own this concert as a piece of rock history.What do we get for moving away from the DVD and over to the Blu-ray? In a word, not much.The source for the concert footage was shot with 16mm film, so the hi-def scanning available to the Blu-ray doesn't yield as much detail as one may expect from, for example, a 35mm source. Because of this, the Blu-ray version presents itself as 1080i, which is the equivalent of 540p. Therefore the concert doesn't scream out for hi-def treatment, so consumers can buy the DVD without much compromise in terms of picture quality. In terms of audio, naturally the DVD will present itself in compressed audio (as all DVDs do), so it is lossy with the throughput equivalent to a mid to high-range mp3 (which is about one fourth to one fifth of uncompressed PCM throughput). The Blu-ray surpasses the DVD offering in this regard: the audio is technically crisper in its uncompressed presentation, though most consumers probably don't have the high end audio equipment to notice the difference. With all that said, I believe the Blu-ray is most fitting for audiophiles who wish to hear the audio of the concert in uncompressed format, since the uptick in picture quality between DVD and Blu-ray is nominal at best.The caveat I mention in the review title is that the audio mix of the concert involved a heavy dose of studio clean-up, to the point that even the casual observer may ask whether the concert is in fact really just the studio cut acted out and lip-synced on a stage with sounds of the audience layered into the mix. This is not the case for the instruments or backing vocals, but Peter's vocals are most definitely re-worked in a studio setting. Some internet research shows as much, so buyer beware: you're not actually going to hear the concert as it was presented, but you're also not going to hear the studio cut either. Gabriel reworked the vocals in a semi-live studio setting to clean up aberrances in the soundboard recording for this concert release. At times the singing doesn't align with his lips and mouth, but it's something that may not bother zealously devoted fans, but to the casual concert DVD collector, this may perturb the experience.I recommend this concert, but again, the Blu-ray is probably beneficial only to audiophiles who have the equipment powerful enough to decipher lossless signals.",3,"Great audio and decent video, with one enormous caveat",1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,2815,"['possibly', 'one', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'most', 'engaging', 'tours', 'containing', 'samples', 'then-current', 'release', 'Us', 'also', 'reaching', 'far', 'back', 'catalog', 'well', 'Gabriel', 'stage', 'presence', 'undisputed', 'industry', 'nicely', 'DVD', 'being', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'supporting', 'musicians', 'surrounding', 'Gabriel', 'likewise', 'display', 'virtuosity', 'flawless', 'execution', 'concert', 'relic', 'consider', 'privilege', 'own', 'concert', 'piece', 'rock', 'history.What', 'do', 'get', 'moving', 'away', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'word', 'not', 'much.The', 'source', 'concert', 'footage', 'was', 'shot', '16mm', 'film', 'hi-def', 'scanning', 'available', 'Blu-ray', ""n't"", 'yield', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'one', 'may', 'expect', 'example', '35mm', 'source', 'Blu-ray', 'version', '1080i', 'equivalent', '540p', 'Therefore', 'concert', ""n't"", 'scream', 'out', 'hi-def', 'treatment', 'consumers', 'can', 'buy', 'DVD', 'much', 'compromise', 'terms', 'picture', 'quality', 'terms', 'audio', 'naturally', 'DVD', 'will', 'present', 'compressed', 'audio', 'DVDs', 'do', 'lossy', 'throughput', 'equivalent', 'mid', 'high-range', 'mp3', 'one', 'fourth', 'one', 'fifth', 'uncompressed', 'PCM', 'throughput', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'offering', 'regard', 'audio', 'technically', 'crisper', 'uncompressed', 'presentation', 'most', 'consumers', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'end', 'audio', 'equipment', 'notice', 'difference', 'said', 'believe', 'Blu-ray', 'most', 'fitting', 'audiophiles', 'who', 'wish', 'hear', 'audio', 'concert', 'uncompressed', 'format', 'uptick', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'nominal', 'best.The', 'caveat', 'mention', 'review', 'title', 'audio', 'mix', 'concert', 'involved', 'heavy', 'dose', 'studio', 'clean-up', 'point', 'even', 'casual', 'observer', 'may', 'ask', 'concert', 'fact', 'really', 'just', 'studio', 'cut', 'acted', 'out', 'lip-synced', 'stage', 'sounds', 'audience', 'layered', 'mix', 'not', 'case', 'instruments', 'backing', 'vocals', 'Peter', 'vocals', 'are', 'most', 'definitely', 're-worked', 'studio', 'setting', 'internet', 'research', 'as', 'much', 'so', 'buyer', 'beware', ""'re"", 'not', 'actually', 'going', 'hear', 'concert', 'was', 'presented', ""'re"", 'also', 'not', 'going', 'hear', 'studio', 'cut', 'Gabriel', 'reworked', 'vocals', 'semi-live', 'studio', 'setting', 'clean', 'up', 'aberrances', 'soundboard', 'recording', 'concert', 'release', 'times', 'singing', ""n't"", 'align', 'lips', 'mouth', 'something', 'may', 'not', 'bother', 'zealously', 'devoted', 'fans', 'casual', 'concert', 'DVD', 'collector', 'may', 'perturb', 'experience.I', 'recommend', 'concert', 'again', 'Blu-ray', 'probably', 'beneficial', 'only', 'audiophiles', 'who', 'have', 'equipment', 'powerful', 'enough', 'decipher', 'lossless', 'signals']",N/A

Some of the vocal parts have also been re-done and sound alot better, particulary on songs like Kiss That Frog and Sledgehammer.

The small flavor would occur in places where Peter and his band would happen to play some of the songs from the track list, with any available instruments. The medium flavor would be like concert I had the opportunity of seeing in my home country (Venezuela): the band with their own instruments, playing the entire set, and using some of the visual effects that the larger production boasted (I have to say this 'mid-sized' version of the concert almost got me killed of a heart-attack -I'm not joking- due to all the emotions I experienced throughout it). The large 'flavor' was the one most northern hemisphere countries had a chance to enjoy, and what ended up registered in the video and the live album you're reading about here.The band lineup is just as good as the one in Peter's previous live album 'Plays Live.' The drums, previously played by Jerry Marotta, are played by Mounsieur Manu Katche (also played with Sting, Eric Clapton and others); Jean Claude Naimro took the place of David Sancious (from the live So period); David Rhodes, Tony Levin, and -of course- PG were still part of the line-up; and Paula Cole (now famous for her albums Harbinger, This Fire and Amen) did beautiful backing vocals.Particularly amazing are: the opening 'Come Talk to Me,' a true display of musicianship meant to get the crowd off their feet; the visuals of 'Accross the River,' 'Steam,' and 'Digging in the Dirt;' the sinplicity and beauty of the rendition of 'Red Rain' and the musical strength of 'Secret World' and 'In your Eyes,' bound for making the hairs in the back of your neck stand up.Whether you've been following Peter Gabriel for his theatricals (when performing), his lyrics, his music, or a combination of all of the above, this concert simply belongs in your collection; no questions asked.

The sound quality is very good on a 5.1 system (both Dolby and DTS).

To me, this concert is the gold standard for all modern rock concerts.  It is that good.  Secret World Live represents a very unique ability to take two albums (So and Us), and combine them to create a new conceptual piece.Call it rock opera, call it performance art, or just call it great music, it is all of these.  Great passion and emotion are the hallmarks of each song.  It is so good the two CD set is just that much better after seeing the DVD.  The band and back-up performers are great.  Paula Cole's performance provides the sexual tension that pervades many of Gabriel's songs.  The interaction with regulars Tony Levin and David Rhodes is great.

While the quality could have been better, it could have been much worse.  There may be other issues with video but I didn't have them.  I suspect those with large screen TVs will notice a bit of graininess as I did detect some when examining the picture closely.I wanted to discuss the audio.  It should be noted that this DVD has three different audio tracks.  Dolby 2.0, Dolby 5.1 and DTS.  When I originally popped in the DVD I paid no attention to selecting what audio track I wanted.  I figured my DVD player would select the appropriate track.  During the playback I was extremely disappointed at the lack of 'depth' and bass in the recording.When reading reviews of a couple people saying the bass was great, I went into 'audio setup' to see what it was set at.  Lo and behold the default was set to **DTS** when I just have a basic 2 speaker setup.  Switching the audio to Dolby 2.0 made a significant difference in the audio quality and brought back bass quality to the recording.  It's not quite as strong as it was on VHS, but it's still quite decent.So if you do get (or have) this DVD, use the audio setup from the main menu if you're not using a DTS receiver.  If you have two speakers, choose Dolby 2.0 - only use Dolby 5.1 mode if you have that setup (6 speakers) and only use DTS if you have a DTS receiver.  Make sure your audio is set BEFORE you play this disc!I won't dwell too much on the issue of overdubs.  I would have wished that Peter didn't overlay new audio over old.  It's not so much that destroys the audio (it doesn't) but moreso that this was a show in it's own time.  Like a glimpse into the past, it's meant to be seen and heard as it occurred.Nevertheless, it's an outstanding show.  I agree with others in that it plays more like a performance and not a simple concert.

When a musical artist penetrates you and you feel their message, you are completely drawn in.  The African rhythms only add to the power of his music.  Fantastic show.The 16mm film transfer is quite good, better than video would have looked at that time.  It's a little hazy and soft but lower your brightness do get decent blacks and it takes on a more film-like look.Having watched this a few times I can with certainty say that you'll need to lower your brightness on your tv...as low as you can stand it in fact, the different hues become so much more visible with richer saturuation (like film should look).  Also, I find the PCM stereo soundtrack to be better than the surround track.  Bass is better and soundstaging is much better.  Red Rain as an extra is only available in PCM stereo and it has amazing bass.  I imagine the original track was in stereo so no wonder it sounds better.

Instead of heeding to the negative reviews, I decided to view it with my own eyes because it's truly one of the best concerts ever.  But I ended up returning the DVD and purchased it on VHS with the &#34;original&#34; 1994 release date because the &#34;SOUND&#34; quality was so much better and I didn't loose ALL the artistic visual elements with the &#34;fake&#34; widescreen format!!!  The remastered version is not worth your money!  Peter Gabriel should care more about reproducing this masterpiece and take another stab at it because this DVD release is absolutely horrendous!  The VHS copy (even though it's mildly smokey looking) is still much better in my opinion - largely because the sound quality is dramatically better in VHS!  The remastered DVD's sound was actually more muffled and flat throughout the performance - and let's face it, music concerts are FIRST about sound!  So all together, this DVD is a huge disappointment.  I recommend searching out a copy on VHS (sadly).",1,Remastered DVD is Horrible!!!,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,1072,"['actual', 'concert', 'BEST', 'so-called', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'worst', 'Instead', 'heeding', 'negative', 'reviews', 'decided', 'view', 'own', 'eyes', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'concerts', 'ever', 'ended', 'up', 'returning', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'VHS', '34', 'original', '34', '1994', 'release', 'date', '34', 'SOUND', '34', 'quality', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'loose', 'artistic', 'visual', 'elements', '34', 'fake', '34', 'widescreen', 'format', 'remastered', 'version', 'not', 'worth', 'money', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'should', 'care', 'more', 'reproducing', 'masterpiece', 'take', 'stab', 'DVD', 'release', 'absolutely', 'horrendous', 'VHS', 'copy', 'even', 'mildly', 'smokey', 'looking', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'opinion', 'largely', 'sound', 'quality', 'dramatically', 'better', 'VHS', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'sound', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'muffled', 'flat', 'performance', 'let', 'face', 'music', 'concerts', 'are', 'FIRST', 'sound', 'So', 'together', 'DVD', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'recommend', 'searching', 'out', 'copy', 'VHS', 'sadly']",N/A
