The more significant message, however, is the depiction of inter-generational patterned behavior. Kerry Washington and Lonette Mckee shine as mother and daughter each acting out of their own individual emotional turmoil.The interaction is remarkably true to life. Director Demane Davis brings inter-generational issues to the surface and forces viewers to face behaviors most people would rather hide in their closets.
