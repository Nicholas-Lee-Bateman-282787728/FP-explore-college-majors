359872,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6303146694,D. Litton,"[9, 24]","There are a number of things that run off the road in Mark Rydell's ""Intersection,"" one of which is a severe identity crisis that resonates from its lack of character development and intriguing material. It tells the story of a man torn between two women, one of whom is his wife, the other his mistress, but the film moves so awkwardly, ambling towards an ending that is doomed from the start, that we never come to care for his personal struggle, nor those of the women in his life.The film uses everything from flashbacks to premonitions and dreams to tell its story, yet with everything that's going on, there is a strong absence of interest in any of it. We know from the start that the film's end cannot be joyful: it opens with a car accident, in which Vincent Eastman (Richard Gere) careens out of control. Before anything else happens, we are suddenly taken to the past, where we see him as a successful architect who has been separated from his wife of sixteen years, and has been living with another woman for some time.The other woman is Olivia (Lolita Davidovich), a perky, upbeat magazine writer whose zest for life has seemingly reawakened Vincent from a deep sleep, that which he attributes to his spouse, Sally (Sharon Stone), whose chilly demeanor and icy words are supposedly what brought their marriage to its crossroads (a flashback later in the film reveals the actual reason for their separation).At first, it looks as if Vincent is totally committed to his new love, but then things change. He spends more time with his daughter, who pleads with him to come to the islands during her spring break. He ultimately does not, but the fact that his wife is also his coworker doesn't make matters much easier. Soon enough (as if we knew nothing of where this road was headed), Vincent finds himself in a tight spot, caught between his love for Olivia, and his past with his family, for whom he stills cares.All of this might actually carry some heft if not for the absolute lack of good characterization. Other than what we see on the outside (Olivia's perkiness, Sally's despondency), there is little to suggest that these people have any real emotions underneath their outwardly facades. However good the performances from Gere, Davidovich, and Stone (especially Stone) happen to be, the characters they inhabit have no feelings that connect us to their tribulations, thus leaving us to wander aimlessly in search of something with which to identify.For instance, other that his adultery, what was it that actually started the Eastmans to grow apart? A minor flashback featuring the two engaging in lite bathroom foreplay, during which she takes a phone call, suggests such elements, but the back-and-forth editing, the storytelling fashion, leave little room for expansion on such important plot points. Such is the case with Vincent's initial involvement with Olivia; we see the two meet, talk, warm to one another, but given the fact that we know next to nothing about his marriage, why even go to the trouble of understanding this relationship? Rather than allowing us the chance to get to know the people and their lives, the film gives us mere glimpses from the outside without ever taking any of the material to a higher, more involving level.So what is the movie, really? A drama? An erotic thriller? A TV Movie of the Week trapped on the big screen? We may never know. What I do know is that ""Intersection"" is one dead end after another, it's title suggesting a metaphor that the film itself is too brain-dead to realize. In the end, it all amounts to a squandered cast, a lifeless script, and the realization that Sharon Stone could end it all less painfully with an ice pick.",1,"""Intersection"" is one dead end after another.",1018828800,"04 15, 2002",2002,3706,"['are', 'number', 'things', 'run', 'road', 'Mark', 'Rydell', 'Intersection', 'one', 'severe', 'identity', 'crisis', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'intriguing', 'material', 'story', 'man', 'torn', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'whom', 'wife', 'other', 'mistress', 'film', 'moves', 'so', 'awkwardly', 'ambling', 'towards', 'ending', 'doomed', 'start', 'never', 'come', 'care', 'personal', 'struggle', 'women', 'life.The', 'film', 'everything', 'flashbacks', 'premonitions', 'dreams', 'tell', 'story', 'yet', 'everything', 'going', 'strong', 'absence', 'interest', 'know', 'start', 'film', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'joyful', 'car', 'accident', 'Vincent', 'Eastman', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'control', 'anything', 'else', 'are', 'suddenly', 'taken', 'past', 'where', 'see', 'successful', 'architect', 'who', 'been', 'separated', 'wife', 'sixteen', 'years', 'been', 'living', 'woman', 'time.The', 'other', 'woman', 'Olivia', 'Lolita', 'Davidovich', 'perky', 'upbeat', 'magazine', 'writer', 'zest', 'life', 'seemingly', 'reawakened', 'Vincent', 'deep', 'sleep', 'spouse', 'Sally', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'chilly', 'demeanor', 'icy', 'words', 'are', 'supposedly', 'what', 'brought', 'marriage', 'crossroads', 'flashback', 'later', 'film', 'actual', 'reason', 'separation', '.At', 'first', 'Vincent', 'totally', 'committed', 'new', 'love', 'then', 'things', 'change', 'more', 'time', 'daughter', 'who', 'come', 'islands', 'spring', 'break', 'ultimately', 'not', 'fact', 'wife', 'also', 'coworker', ""n't"", 'make', 'matters', 'much', 'easier', 'Soon', 'enough', 'knew', 'nothing', 'where', 'road', 'was', 'headed', 'Vincent', 'tight', 'spot', 'caught', 'love', 'Olivia', 'past', 'family', 'whom', 'cares.All', 'might', 'actually', 'carry', 'heft', 'not', 'absolute', 'lack', 'good', 'characterization', 'Other', 'what', 'see', 'outside', 'Olivia', 'perkiness', 'Sally', 'despondency', 'little', 'suggest', 'people', 'have', 'real', 'emotions', 'underneath', 'outwardly', 'facades', 'However', 'good', 'performances', 'Gere', 'Davidovich', 'Stone', 'especially', 'Stone', 'happen', 'be', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'have', 'feelings', 'connect', 'tribulations', 'thus', 'leaving', 'wander', 'aimlessly', 'search', 'something', 'identify.For', 'instance', 'other', 'adultery', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'started', 'Eastmans', 'grow', 'apart', 'minor', 'flashback', 'featuring', 'two', 'engaging', 'lite', 'bathroom', 'foreplay', 'phone', 'call', 'such', 'elements', 'back-and-forth', 'editing', 'storytelling', 'fashion', 'leave', 'little', 'room', 'expansion', 'such', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'Such', 'case', 'Vincent', 'initial', 'involvement', 'Olivia', 'see', 'two', 'meet', 'talk', 'warm', 'one', 'given', 'fact', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'marriage', 'why', 'even', 'go', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'relationship', 'Rather', 'allowing', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'lives', 'film', 'mere', 'glimpses', 'outside', 'ever', 'taking', 'material', 'higher', 'more', 'involving', 'level.So', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'drama', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'TV', 'Movie', 'Week', 'trapped', 'big', 'screen', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'Intersection', 'one', 'dead', 'end', 'title', 'suggesting', 'metaphor', 'film', 'too', 'brain-dead', 'realize', 'end', 'amounts', 'squandered', 'cast', 'lifeless', 'script', 'realization', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'could', 'end', 'less', 'painfully', 'ice', 'pick']",N/A

(See also Gere and Kaprisky in Breathless: a stunning couple in the prime of their youth.)However, there is far more to this movie than a slick presentation.  Stone's cool blonde beauty is a little too icy, making the flame of the warm redhead (Davidovich) too hard for Gere to resist.Sally and Olivia are poised and dignified when they meet, which encourages respect for the characters and an interest in following their story.The eventual train wreck of a car wreck is tough to watch.  The director uses slow motion to good advantage.  Tragic as Vincent's demise is, we get to see his vision where he ends up with the girl, and Sally ends up with the guy of her choice.  In a perfect world the ex will always lift a glass to his or her replacement, but how often does that actually happen?

That is how and what i seen richard gere character,of VINCENT doing,and it was a shame he die at the end like that very tragicand BEST SCENE! overall is when he see the ""signs at the end""whereas;the girl wit the cute face,curly red hair,smile etc. offer him a sweet roll,very cute,he RUSH to call his soulmate,yes his SOULMATE,and told her, on her answering maching,""I seen this lil girl after drivin around all night thinking all night etc""and she has this;RED HAIR, this' RED HAIR, the big brown eyes,etc. she remind me so much of you"" marry me, let us just go DO IT,already i wanna marry you, let's just do it""so you meet me at the inn,by the inn three miles away from the office building etc or the architecture etc.""and the way he was yelling in the phone to her out of pure happiness.OMG, i LOVE THIS movie!!!get emotional when i think of this, i play it often,actually it is on tv tonighti have a guest over,we are enjoyin it,and the part is on now when he say that to her,and the music, VERY well done,beautifully scored,whereas;she is playing back her answering maching hearing him ""choose right""which was her,and closing her eyes laughing,almost crying to hear her man,her soulmate say that to her, just was SO so sweet,but so bittersweet,sadden,when she is literally NOT knowing he is already dead,and or diein'at the hospital,near by,not until see a car at the crash site not realizing till she take a 2nd close-up look it is VINCENT!very sad,and i cry at the scene, toward the conclusion when we see his'dream,how incredibly happy he is at the end,""seeing diff people""pass on through his life,bad,the good etc. and yet it was Lolita character of olivia,the journalist,NOT his wife for whom never at all had time for him,at all,""1 min sex""here and there lol""more about her biz not him,etc. and metanother rich guy etc.just the whole movie was so great but somethingabout the end whereas; ""olivia was holding him as he was shaking coldin her lap,laying there like that'with her wearing white,red hair blowingin wind,as he was""cold""i never put it together till few years later,knowingly  that  he was cold because he was,well...""dieing""that was sad,but so sweet, the scene/dream the music to that part i love it, how tragicNEITHER really knew ""what VINCENT at the end''who he was going to be with,well wife soon to be ex wife,Sharon Stone,character,of SALLY that is right she knew from after  he die the letter to""olivia""was in his pocket,how tragic,so she DID know,but really thought he was ditchin his soulmate Redhead,for her,just that part was clearly ambiguous,as olivia thought by the beautiful happy phone machine msg. he chose her,which prudently he did,then sally the wife, thought it was""her""and meghan the cute teen daughter,so BOTH really At the end,i did not like only that part,the both of them did not really KNOW for sure,anything but he was""gone""so i don'tknow.however,but hauntingly sad,and good all rolled up in one, i just wish the both of em' knew""was able to tell each other""at the end,yea i know he is with me or wouldhave been with me,and i am sorry for your loss etc. but that part was odd to me.and additionally sad,she really DID love her man/husband sally,but was now too late to tell him,even though if vincent had live,i guess well,she would have known he really,wanted and was IN LOVE WITH OLIVIA,SO I GUESS MAYBE it is best how it did end who knows.Nevertheless:the movie INTERSECTION was made i feel the best acting he has done in my overall consensus maybe ever. Next to also INTERNAL AFFAIRS,but GERE acting was very good in this,and i will always love this good,very good but heartfelt,incredible sad film,to be only 30's 40s,is too young to 'drive that

359889,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6303146694,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Intersection started with a disadvantage in that it's a remake of one of my favorite films, Les Choses de la Vie. The original uses a terrible car crash (one of the best ever filmed) as a starting point for a series of flashbacks and reflections on the turning point in an architect's life, when the relationship that ended his marriage is in danger of self-destructing because of his inability to make an effort. But where the accident is that film's focal point, replayed in various different ways as a kind of inescapable destiny, in Intersection it is used almost as an afterthought to bring some resolution to a mundane soap opera about an indecisive man torn between his career-conscious wife and his more liberal lover (though I wonder if that may be last-minute re-editing into a more linear structure to 'save' the film since its original release date was pushed back).It's not a case of not giving the film a chance - there have been interesting re-workings of European films by Hollywood before - or expecting a raunchfest because of Gere or Stone's presence. It's just that it's really not very good.The result isn't exactly unwatchable, but it is overwritten, over scored and surprisingly uncinematic. Rydell gives the film plenty of gloss but few cinematic flourishes, concentrating on the seen-it-all-before romance in a way that seems more TV movie of the week than anything worth paying to see on the big screen. Sharon Stone is superb as the ex-wife and Davidovitch does well as the lover despite some unfortunate and unnecessary scenes towards the end that undermine her character to make Gere look good - which brings me to the film's major failing. Gere's character and performance. Gere can act and has done good work, but this is an especially shallow and by-the-numbers ego trip more than a performance. Aside from being the screen's most unconvincing architect (and that includes Woody Harrelson in Indecent Proposal), the smug, self, narcissistic performance here prevents us from ever caring about whether the character lives or dies. Even the film's one nearly successful scene at a post office when he can't decide whether to post an important letter is ultimately destroyed by his hammy grandstanding phone call at the end of it.Not that the script is any help. Scenes are overwritten, achingly obvious and horribly predictable, with everything spelled out in broad strokes. Ultimately you're just left wandering from predictable scene to predictable scene with little interest. Slick, watchable, forgettable, the final insult is that the novel and Claude Sautet film this misfire is based on is only acknowledged at the very, very end of the credits when no-one is likely to spot it.

The message comes through loud and clear ""treat every moment of your life as if it were your last"".Watching the movie 10 years on, I can really see why the film flopped.
