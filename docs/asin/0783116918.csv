This film is exceptionally well-acted, and Gary Sinise is the spitting image of Harry Truman--even the voice sounds the same. I generally don't cry at the movies, but I did get teary eyed over this one--not because of deaths or tragedies, but because of patriotic sentimentality rarely seen in films today. The man actually took the bible in both hands and kissed it at his inaugurations. Although Truman was (and is) controversial, he comes across in this film in a nostalgic and appealing way.  Highly Recommended.

44016,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,0783116918,CGScammell,"[7, 9]","No other actor other than Gary Sinise could have portrayed Harry Truman as lifelike as he does in this movie.  His wife, portrayed by the just as talented Diana Scarwid, rounds out the First Couple.This two-hour HBO movie starts out with Truman's entry in WWI, his marriage to Bess, but then kicks in suspense when Truman is chairman of a special Senate investigative committee on war contractor fraud at about 30 minutes into this movie.  Here Sinise completey evolves into the president he is portraying and becomes the man the American public remembers.  His manners of speech, his voice, the way he turns down the sides of his mouth, all reveal the Truman as the world knows him. Scarwid stands by her Truman and ages with him in a very convincing manner.  A prosthetic nose of course helps with this realistic image.This movie focuses on all the major events:  Truman's shock and fear of becoming president, his use of the first atomic bomb, details of the Marshall Plan and the Berlin airlift, Truman's actions with the United Nations and the creation of Israel, the Korean War and the spread of the Red Scare, the firing of General MacArthur, battling Senator Joseph McCarthny, Civil Rights issues and in the end Eisenhower's refusal to sit with the Trumans over the traditional coffee chat before the inauguration.Bess' refusal to live for long periods of time in the White House is covered only briefly. She never likes the attention as First Lady or of conducting press interviews. ""You don't need to know me"" she curtly tells the female reporters. She prefers the solitude of her Missouri home.  Bess only comes back for important functions, but still maintains a busy life as First Lady.The viewer sees where Truman's naivete sometimes governed his logic:  he didn't understand the importance of the Middle East (outside of Israel) and Big Business' interest in Arab Oil.The movie ends anticlimactically with Truman's arrival back in his home town train station.Historical news footage is cleaverly interspersed in this movie to introduce the viewer to new events in the Truman White House.  This footage works well to fill in background.Overall, an excellent HBO production true to McCullough's book, and worthy of viewing for anyone.",5,Sinise's best performance,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,2247,"['other', 'actor', 'other', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'could', 'have', 'portrayed', 'Harry', 'Truman', 'as', 'lifelike', 'movie', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'just', 'talented', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'out', 'First', 'Couple.This', 'two-hour', 'HBO', 'movie', 'out', 'Truman', 'entry', 'WWI', 'marriage', 'Bess', 'then', 'kicks', 'suspense', 'when', 'Truman', 'chairman', 'special', 'Senate', 'investigative', 'committee', 'war', 'contractor', 'fraud', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Here', 'Sinise', 'completey', 'president', 'portraying', 'man', 'American', 'public', 'remembers', 'manners', 'speech', 'voice', 'way', 'down', 'sides', 'mouth', 'reveal', 'Truman', 'world', 'Scarwid', 'Truman', 'ages', 'very', 'convincing', 'manner', 'A', 'prosthetic', 'nose', 'course', 'realistic', 'image.This', 'movie', 'major', 'events', 'Truman', 'shock', 'fear', 'becoming', 'president', 'use', 'first', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'details', 'Marshall', 'Plan', 'Berlin', 'airlift', 'Truman', 'actions', 'United', 'Nations', 'creation', 'Israel', 'Korean', 'War', 'spread', 'Red', 'Scare', 'firing', 'General', 'MacArthur', 'battling', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthny', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'issues', 'end', 'Eisenhower', 'refusal', 'sit', 'Trumans', 'traditional', 'coffee', 'chat', 'inauguration.Bess', 'refusal', 'live', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'White', 'House', 'covered', 'only', 'briefly', 'never', 'attention', 'First', 'Lady', 'conducting', 'press', 'interviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'curtly', 'female', 'reporters', 'solitude', 'Missouri', 'home', 'Bess', 'only', 'back', 'important', 'functions', 'still', 'busy', 'life', 'First', 'Lady.The', 'viewer', 'sees', 'where', 'Truman', 'naivete', 'sometimes', 'governed', 'logic', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'importance', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'Big', 'Business', 'interest', 'Arab', 'Oil.The', 'movie', 'anticlimactically', 'Truman', 'arrival', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'train', 'station.Historical', 'news', 'footage', 'cleaverly', 'interspersed', 'movie', 'introduce', 'viewer', 'new', 'events', 'Truman', 'White', 'House', 'footage', 'well', 'fill', 'background.Overall', 'excellent', 'HBO', 'production', 'true', 'McCullough', 'book', 'worthy', 'viewing', 'anyone']",N/A

44021,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,0783116918,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[5, 5]","This movie takes us back in time when talking horse sense meant talking plainly but also talking intelligently. It was a time when character meant meaning what you said and saying what you meant, not wearing your faith on your sleeve, feigning piety, or praising yourself as a patriot.This story is about the horse sense, the plain-talking, the intelligence, the character and determination of one man who could make and stick by unpopular decisions--Harry Truman.Played to perfection by Gary Sinese, we see a man who hesitates running as vice president, who is treated almost as a lackey when the secretary of war tells him to stand where he is while he and the president maintain a private discussion. We see a man who truly feels the weight and burden of the office when he becomes president. We see the man who is racked with the doubt over his miscalculation of a quick end to the invasion in Korea. We see a man who grows into the role of president, and feels that he must run to earn the office under his own right.The women in his life were a central role, particularly his wife Bess, followed by his daughter and a shadowy harpie, his mother-in-law who we see scold him for relieving Douglas MacArthur. He misses Bess terribly who shows no inclination to remain with him in Washington. He refers to a ""Bessless"" White House as his white sepulcher. We sense his loneliness as he describes one of the White Staff serving him dinner and cleaning the table afterward.Sinese brings his talent and character of Truman together neatly in this well-written story. You will believe that Diana Scarwid is Bess Truman with what she brings to the role.If you long for the kind of man or character that once occupied the White House, one who would stand up for what he believed in, this might be the one to satisfy your soul.It might be the next best thing to the real thing.",5,Truly Truman,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,1871,"['movie', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'talking', 'horse', 'sense', 'meant', 'talking', 'plainly', 'also', 'talking', 'intelligently', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'character', 'meant', 'meaning', 'what', 'said', 'saying', 'what', 'meant', 'not', 'wearing', 'faith', 'sleeve', 'feigning', 'piety', 'praising', 'patriot.This', 'story', 'horse', 'sense', 'plain-talking', 'intelligence', 'character', 'determination', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'stick', 'unpopular', 'decisions', 'Harry', 'Truman.Played', 'perfection', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'running', 'vice', 'president', 'who', 'treated', 'almost', 'lackey', 'when', 'secretary', 'war', 'tells', 'stand', 'where', 'president', 'maintain', 'private', 'discussion', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'truly', 'weight', 'burden', 'office', 'when', 'president', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'racked', 'doubt', 'miscalculation', 'quick', 'end', 'invasion', 'Korea', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'role', 'president', 'feels', 'must', 'run', 'earn', 'office', 'own', 'right.The', 'women', 'life', 'were', 'central', 'role', 'particularly', 'wife', 'Bess', 'followed', 'daughter', 'shadowy', 'harpie', 'mother-in-law', 'who', 'see', 'scold', 'relieving', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'Bess', 'terribly', 'who', 'inclination', 'remain', 'Washington', 'Bessless', 'White', 'House', 'white', 'sepulcher', 'sense', 'loneliness', 'one', 'White', 'Staff', 'serving', 'dinner', 'cleaning', 'table', 'afterward.Sinese', 'talent', 'character', 'Truman', 'together', 'neatly', 'well-written', 'story', 'will', 'believe', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'Bess', 'Truman', 'what', 'role.If', 'long', 'kind', 'man', 'character', 'once', 'occupied', 'White', 'House', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'believed', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'satisfy', 'soul.It', 'might', 'be', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'real', 'thing']",N/A

However the movie glosses over quite a bit about the relationship between him, Bess and Mrs. Wallace. I read the book (or ""a book"" possibly not the one this was based on) and got the distinct impression that right from the first he was absolutely ""whipped"" by Bess, her mother then later Margaret.  It took him years to get her to agree to marry him. I assume she was waiting for a better offer then when nobody showed up she accepted him.  Their relationship was complicated by the constant presence of her mother and even her grandmother for years.  Her mother, in fact, moved into the White House with them.  The film also ignored the fact that during the time he was president, the white house roof collapsed under snow, the whole house was declared to be unsafe and they had to move into Blair House for several months.  I think that what shows best here is that he was essentially a totally honest man who had a lot of courage in standing up for what he thought was right no matter who he was facing.  His decision to use the Atom Bomb on Japan was made before anybody had any idea what the long range effects are of radiation. I'm sure he thought it was just like a regular bomb but with a much larger area of destruction.  I've been to both Hiroshima and Nagasaki and I'm sure if he could have looked ahead to what was going to happen he'd have thought longer about it.  But, perhaps not. He was trying to save Allied lives.

He went, commanded men & acquited himself very well. This movie follows his life until the end of his presidency. After the war he failed in business, & aligns himself with the local political boss & crook Tom Pedergast. He got Truman  elected to political jobs but never turned him. Once elected to the US Senate Truman was known as the Senator from Pendergast & carried the stench of scandal. It was pointed out that Truman, with little influence & less money would never have become Senator without the Pedergast machine behind him. Ironically, he became a tireless worker against government waste & graft. Diana Scarwind played Bess Truman & she made Bess look a lot better.

Truman was not really that well-known. So he became president, when FDR died, totally unprepared. He had not been trusted with war secrets as VP. The biggest secret, led to his most important & the best decision of his presidency: Dropping the atomic bomb, ending the war, & saving a million American & Japanese lives.

Harry Truman was the absolute worst president this country as ever had to endure. One of his first actions was to join the KKK in Missouri in order to become affiliated with the foremost political machine in the state. Once he made it to national office, he no longer considered himself a member as he did not need the KKK. What actually makes him the worst president is that he gave all of eastern Europe to the Soviet Union. The allies had just fought a war in order, partially, to keep Europe from being conquered by Nazi Germany. However, Truman just gave all of eastern Europe to the Soviet Union without a shot being fired. His best military leader, General Patton saw the threat from the Soviet quite clear. General Patton wanted to march straight through Germany to protect eastern Europe. Unfortunately, Truman, who knew absolutely about military tactics, disagreed to venomously with Patton that he relieved Patton of his command. A few years later, the same scenario was played out again in the Korean conflict.  General MacArthur, knowing that the war could not be won on the ground, wanted to bomb North Korea and China with 30 to 50 atom bombs. Again, Truman,  who still knew absolutely about military tactics, relieved General MacArthur of his command and the war was lost. Harry Truman was the reason the United States was involved in the cold war. If he had done what his military experts had wanted to do, there would have been no Soviet Union, Communist China, Communist North Korea or Communist Cuban.

This story does show in pretty good detail those forces that shaped his life and how they would play out later in life when he was catipulted into the Presidency of the United States by Roosevelt's untimely death.Truman was thrust into the presidency during the ebbing throws of world war.  Even as the War World was ending and this Nations Manhattan Project moving toward success Truman still had some enormous decisions to make.  A timid man could not have guided the country as Truman did during his presidency.  Truman was the first president to take on the awesome responsibility of the Atomic Warfare.  Truman was president at a time when the Cold War threatened to become hot and only his cool paragmatic down home thinking stood between our country perhaps another even bloodier war with an aggresively expansionist Communist Soviet Union.Truman was not a perfect DVD but the acting is first rate.  You get a sense of tension that defined this period in our countries history.  While I felt the United States was more than right for dropping both atomic bombs on Japan's homeland I am happy Truman did agonize ever so slightly over the moral issues associated with his decision.In the end Trumans decision to drop both bombs was a no brainer.
