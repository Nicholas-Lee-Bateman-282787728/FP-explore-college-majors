But I will try to be objective and point out the successes and flaws. The two leads Ed and Al and both deep, complex, emotional characters that you will come to love as the series goes on. The animation is fantastic, a great dub as well. There is a very well done mix of action, drama, and comedy, a single episode will have you crying, laughing, and on the edge of your seat. The overall plot is well done as well, the final 6 episodes of this season are spectacular.Now for the flaws, Ed and Al are very well developed, but the other side characters are very much left in the dust, and most will barely get developed at all, even into the second season. The middle episodes seem to drag on a bit and don't offer much plot, but this is a very short break. Ultimately though, the biggest issue with Fullmetal Alchemist, is the existence of its younger brother, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It so far surpasses the original in terms of quality that the tiny little flaws of the original seem to come more readily to the surface. So I will say this now:WATCH FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST BEFORE BROTHERHOODThis show is a true classic that you have to experience to for yourself.

1207433,AD0YLZOELYS73,B001K98M78,Christianpoetwannabe,"[1, 2]","I love FMA. I recommend it over the newer Brotherhood series, but I won't go into that. Fullmetal Alchemist has a beautiful storyline. I'm not much of a crier, but this anime has jerked a couple tears out of me. I usually tend to look for animes that have either a good storyline or alot of comedy, since honestly alot only have one or the other. But FMA has a beautiful blend of action, comedy, character development, and emotion. It's not the cheesy violence and constant rude humor that draws in shallow fans. It has a deep and intriguing story. It's realistic, with victory and failure, sorrow and joy. Everything doesn't always end happy for everyone, and though we may not like it, that's the way FMA portrays things. This is a very well developed anime. The artwork and soundtrack are also beautiful.That said, I do have my own personal issues with it (that I realize may not be relevant to others, but I'd like to include). Although it isn't riddled with rude humor (which I greatly appreciate), it does have other content that I'm not pleased with. FMA has a large amount of language that I don't think is suitable for the age group it's meant for, and alot of gore. I realize it's just being realistic (something I praised it for before), but I think it could have done without it. I also realize that this is a trademark of anime, and it comes with the territory. But I still think it deserves a warning.My summary: A beautiful anime (better than most I've seen), but beware of the questionable content.",4,A great anime,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,1514,"['love', 'FMA', 'recommend', 'newer', 'Brotherhood', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'beautiful', 'storyline', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'crier', 'anime', 'jerked', 'couple', 'usually', 'tend', 'look', 'animes', 'have', 'good', 'storyline', 'alot', 'comedy', 'honestly', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'other', 'FMA', 'beautiful', 'blend', 'action', 'comedy', 'character', 'development', 'emotion', 'not', 'cheesy', 'violence', 'constant', 'rude', 'humor', 'shallow', 'fans', 'deep', 'intriguing', 'story', 'realistic', 'victory', 'failure', 'sorrow', 'joy', 'Everything', ""n't"", 'always', 'end', 'happy', 'everyone', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'way', 'FMA', 'things', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'anime', 'artwork', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'also', 'beautiful.That', 'said', 'do', 'have', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'realize', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'relevant', 'others', ""'d"", 'like', 'include', ""n't"", 'riddled', 'rude', 'humor', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'have', 'other', 'content', ""'m"", 'not', 'pleased', 'FMA', 'large', 'amount', 'language', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'suitable', 'age', 'group', 'meant', 'alot', 'gore', 'realize', 'just', 'being', 'realistic', 'something', 'praised', 'before', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'also', 'realize', 'trademark', 'anime', 'territory', 'still', 'think', 'warning.My', 'summary', 'beautiful', 'anime', 'better', 'most', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'beware', 'questionable', 'content']",Fullmetal Alchemist: Season 1

1207442,AOQCMV497N2VH,B001K98M78,HappyBlushCalayapie,"[2, 2]","Okay, so I bought season 1 (this boxset) a few months ago thinking, 'it's inexpensive right now, it's popular, and I need to watch it someday, but I probably won't get so into it that I feel the need to own the rest of it, right?' and then, I watched an episode 3 days ago. I finished the series in about 2.5 days, and would have done it faster if I hadn't been sick and unable to sit up the whole time. I'm so excited about it that I even wanna show my mom this series! I think she'll like it since her and I are fans of Supernatural, and this is pretty similar in a way.This next part is so parents can know what's in it, or so that kids who have seen a little of the series can know whether they'd need to watch it in secret or out in the open.For those of you who want to know of the general content, it has some cursing in it, but they never say the f-word (can't remember if they ever said the s-word, but they said the d-word and b*****d a lot). There's quite a bit of violence, but I wouldn't call anything in this series scary. There's no romance (a nice change of pace for me), there's no ecchi (which means no panties or naked boobs or softcore sex), but there is one scene where someone accidentally grabbed someone else's boob one time, but he immediately got away from her and apologized profusely (I'd say which character, but I don't wanna spoil anything. Not that that scene is some sort of major series turner or something, which it isn't). Also, there are lots of things like government conspiracies and religious cults (don't worry. If you're a Christian like me, their god is like the sun god or other stuff like that. Just treat it as a good story and ignore it. If you are a kid reading this and thought you wanted to show it to your parents and they're psycho-religious, you may wanna keep this hidden just to be safe). And naturally, as it says in the title, there's Alchemy. So they're drawing circles and using magic type stuff, mixed with tons of scientific knowledge (to the parents, know they're not chanting to Satan--or anyone in that matter--I swear).The voice acting is AWESOME. I had recently finished rewatchign Ouran High School Host Club, and I knew that the same guy who does Tamaki in english also does Edward, so I thought &#34;I wanna hear him talk some more&#34; so I watched the series. I almost NEVER watch a series in English first (I rarely watch them in English at ALL but this was truly special).*****This next part contains some spoilers. If you're not okay with spoilers, it'd be good to skip this part.*****The series starts off showing Ed and Al using Alchemy when they were about five years younger or so. They were trying to bring back their mother by using the forbidden human transmutation, and Al ended up having his body sucked into a vortext. It is later explained that Ed had to literally give an arm and a leg to save Al, and he bound his little brother's soul to the armor in the corner of the room, which is really hard for Alchemists to do.Then, after that, it skips ahead five years for two episodes (and you almost feel like you're being thrown into the middle of the series instead of having more of an explanation first), and then they go back to when they were kids and explain what really happened (which I just spoiled above), and also how Edward got his leg and arm made of metal (which is called auto mail). Over time, things are explained about how Edward became a state alchemist when he was only twelve, and things carry on from there.That's really all I needed to say. As for the opening and ending theme songs, there is one opening them for the first half of season 1 (didn't care too much for it), one ending theme for the first part (can't remember it), the second ending theme song (Ready Steady Go, which I love) and the second ending theme song which whenever I watch it, it always sets the mood for the next episode perfectly. I love the music, but I stayed for the story, basically. I regret nothing.The only thing I regret is not already having the second season in my possession, and not having the money to buy Brotherhood, which is two boxsets after season 2. (I convinced my mom to buy it because it went down to a little over 12 bucks). When I get in season 2, I'll own 51 episodes of it. It'll be the longest anime I have ever owned so far, and as I keep collecting, the most expensive, too.Sorry for this long, rambling review. I hope it did you some good, and helped you decide whether you would be interested in it or not for the content. it's hilarious when it's trying to be funny, when it's sad it's tear jerking, when it's dark, it's SUPER dark. This series did everything right (I just wish that all the episodes of every season, plus the OVAs and movies, were in one boxset).I love Fullmetal Alchemist!",5,"Whoa, This Is

1207446,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B001K98M78,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[1, 1]","The only other perfect anime series I've seen besides Cowboy Bebop.First a brief summary of the plot.  The story takes place in a alternate earth in a country called Amestris.  Alchemy is uesd heavily in this world, unlike our own.  The story follows Edward and Alphonse Eleric brothers on their search for the Philosopher stone to restore their bodies they had lost when they tried to bring their mother back to life.  They join the STATE ALCHEMIST under Roy Mustang so they can search better for the stone.  Now onto the many reasons why this series is perfect.First the story:  It's simply brilliant, I've seen nothing like it.  The story is captivating, it draws you in and never lets you go.  It mixes drama, action/adventure, religion, family, and fantasy perfectly.  It's emotionally charged as you follow Ed and Al on their tragic journey.  There are no flaws int the story, it even surprises you when one of the main characters dies, which will surprise you and even bring tears to your eyes.Second are the Characters:  Simply Perfect.  There are many characters from Ed and Al to Roy, Winry, Riza Hawkeye, Maes Hughes, Scar, Lust, and many others.  Each bring something to the series and engage you into the series.  Of course my favorite character is the one who ended up getting killed, I won't say which one, but it drew me even more into the series.  As the story progresses onto the second half of the series you'll be introduced to even more great characters.Third is the Animation:  The animation was excellent.  It was done by Bones which has done other great series like WOLF'S RAIN, RAHXEPHON, EUREKA SEVEN, and MARS DAYBREAK.Fourth the music:  It was classic.  The music which was mostly classic style was breathtaking and added extra emotion to the show.Overall Fullmetal Alchemist is perfect series which makes statements about war, religion and family.  It is a must to any anime fan.  Though skip the movie it adds nothing to the series and isn't good.

The first disc contains seven episodes, the second disc contains six episodes, the third disc contains six episodes and a commentary on episode nineteen, and the fourth disc contains six episodes, a commentary on episode twenty-five, and the extras.The first extra included on the fourth disc is labeled as ""Japanese Commercials.""  However, it turns out that this feature only contains one commercial, which lasts for a whole seventeen seconds.  When I discovered that was the extent of the ""Japanese Commercials,"" I felt that the label on this feature was misleading and a form of ""false advertising.""The next feature is the music video for ""Ready, Steady, Go,"" by L'Arc-en-Ciel, which is the second opening theme song for Fullmetal Alchemist.  The music video primarily features the actual band, with some shots featuring an animated version of the band.  However, nothing in the video ties in to Fullmetal Alchemist.  The third special feature is a commercial for Tofu Records, the label that released ""Ready, Steady, Go.""  The commercial runs for seventeen seconds, and it is an ad for L'Arc-en-Ciel's album that features the song.The next feature on the disc is the textless openings and closings.  Both of the openings and both of the closings that appear on this set are included.  While the credit text may not be included, you still get the subtitles if you're watching the set with the Japanese audio.  The final extra on the fourth disc are trailers.When this DVD set was put together, FUNimation included the booklets from the first six individual discs that were released.  However, since only four episodes were released on each of the individual discs, there are only episode write-ups for the first twenty-four episodes.  Each booklet contains a write-up from someone associated with the Japanese production, character information and images, information from the series, artwork, and episode write-ups.  The booklets are very well-done and contain a lot of information.The quality of the series, as well as the booklets included in the set, more than make up for the very minor flaws of this release.

To obtain, something of equal value must be lost--that is alchemy's first law of equivalent exchange... in those days, we really believed that to be the world's one and only truth.""~Alfonse Elric, introduction to every episode.To primitive minds there is no difference between science and magic--and in a world where magic is reality, there are truly no limits to human ambition and the possibilities of the creative imagination. Right?Wrong.In a dark room of a country homestead, two distraught brothers attempt to use alchemy to raise their mother from the dead, but like Victor Frankenstein, their crime is thinking that human ambition comes without rules or ethics. The results of their folly are tragic: alchemy requires that transmutation have an equal exchange... but what price could be equal to a human life? Flesh is traded for flesh--one boy loses his leg, and the other his entire body. In desperation, Ed sacrifices his own arm to fuse his brother's soul to an empty suit of armor. Meanwhile, a horrific abomination of twisted flesh and blood breathes its last breath into the floor... for though the boys could create a body, even with all their sacrifices they could never give it a soul.The world is a cruel place with no tolerance for the naivet&eacute; of children... there is no mercy holding back the horrors of truth from the young and reckless. Life makes no distinction between boys and men--and so the damaged brothers are forced to hasten their maturity and join the world of adults. A state-alchemist from the capital named Roy Mustang appears to offer the boys a chance to reclaim their bodies by joining the government, gaining them access to resources... but restoring what they lost will take something more akin to a miracle. Donning ""automail"" prosthetics to replace his missing arm and leg, Edward sets out with his brother, burning down their family home and leaving behind everything of their pasts... all for a chance to make things right and atone for his crimes by restoring his brother's body, along with his own.Never before has a shonen anime attempted and achieved such a remarkable degree of thematic depth--delivering the intense action we are used to, along with meditations on the subjects of grief, sin, sacrifice, love, loss, redemption, family bonds, scientific ambition, the nature of nature, guilt, and more. Fullmetal Alchemist is rife with meaning, and because of this it stands out from other shonen anime as a work of genuine artistic merit (or at least as much as any action show can aspire to). What's more is that FMA delivers this depth without ever sacrificing its story, characters, and visual flair--a perfect marriage of action, drama and thought.This is not to say that FMA is entirely flawless... and one of the reasons I summarized the backstory of the series so completely in my introduction was to help alleviate one of its biggest and most glaring issues. Fullmetal Alchemist tells the story of the bothers' past in fragmented bits and pieces that never intrigue so much as confuse, and it takes a long time to fully understand what happened to the boys and develop a true attachment to them and their quest. And because so much of the show's dramatic and thematic depth is tied to these flashback scenes, most of the deeper concepts being thrown around are lost on first-time viewers. Once the full story is told however, it becomes nearly impossible not to grow attached to these characters... and since FMA clocks in at only fifty-one episodes (far less than the average Shonen of 200+ episodes), this series is entirely worth both the money and the time it takes to view.There is, however, one other fault that viewers should know going in: when this series was made, the manga it was based upon by Hiromu Arakawa had not yet reached its conclusion. After episode 25, the anime writers were forced to abandon the vision of the original creator and author in order to invent their own continuation for the second season. To be fair, the result is surprisingly good and cohesive... but this may still disturb some viewers on mere principle. So many fans were unsettled about this development that Studio Bones decided to readapt the manga more faithful into a separate anime series titled ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"". I shall not lie: I personally prefer FMA: Brotherhood over this 2003 series, but there are plenty of fans who would disagree with me... so many, that I would recommend watching both shows and coming to your own decision if time and funds permit. If you have the money, but not the time for both, go for Brotherhood. But for those with lean pocketbooks, this original series is far cheaper... and in the end, both FMA and FMA:B are excellent shows worth viewing.Fullmetal Alchemist is, by leaps and bounds, one of the best Shonen anime series ever made... an anime that even non-shonen and non-anime fans can enjoy without the slightest trepidation. It is a lavishly produced and masterfully written action-drama that succeeds not merely in reaching for the stars, but in actually grasping hold of them.Content Warning:Fullmetal Alchemist is a show about hope, despair, and the totality of death. There is blood in this series, along with minor gore and swearing... but in the case of FMA, the dramatic content is more disturbing and noteworthy: characters die, bad things happen to good people, and the results are often mortifying. Ages may vary, but I would not recommend FMA for audiences under 13.Packaging:The Viridian Collection of Season 1 is 25 episodes long spread out across  four discs (Season 2 contains the remaining 26 episodes). The set comprises four slim-size DVD cases in a flimsy but attractive cardboard box. Special features includes the textless Opening and Ending themes, the music video for ""Ready, Steady, Go"", along with series advertisements and the usual trailers for other Funimation releases. (Note that Season 2 contains interviews with the English Dub cast that are not included here).",5,Two brothers will sacrifice everything to be whole again,1360281600,"02 8,

Much like funimations recent blu-ray ""S.A.V.E."" sets, they are just repackaged anime series in cheaper form to allow people with more limited budgets to get the anime's they would like.  I don't own the original set, but this set contains all the special features identified on the original set, and the picture and audio quality are all top notch (though I'm not a fan of the fact that I can't skip over the advertisements when the disc is initially started).  So, if you're interest in Fullmetal Alchemist, and would like to save some money, this is the way to go.As to the show, it is a rather amazing show, filled with humor, action, tragedy, and some of the best characterization (and twists) I've seen in an anime.  I have to warn you, if you start it, you're probably not going to want to stop watching it until you're finished.  The story progresses nicely, and things you didn't understand before become more clear as the show progresses.  The only complaint I really have with the series is that it ends.

Full metal Alchemist is new my favorite series ( as my title says) The story follows brother Edward and Alphonse Elric. There mother died when they were young, i know sounds cliched right? well it's not there mother dying is more then just a pain they have to carry because it leads to a chain event of things that begin the series. The two are alchemist who can transform things with trans mutate metal objects and turn them into whatever they want. After there mother dies the two decide they want to bring here back to life using alchemy but it backfires because you can't exchange anything for human life. The two pay up dearly for the mistake Edward the older one loses his right arm and left foot and Alphonse,younger, loses his whole body! Ed thinks quick on his feet and puts his brother's soul into a suit of armor so he could save him (if you though transformers when you saw Al on the cover you'll be shocked like me) The two brothers start their quest to find the philosopher's stone which uses high level alchemy to get their missing body parts back. The whole anime is full of amazing characters Edward is funny, stubborn and just flat out cool. Alphonse is the  more childish sympathetic one and it's so ironic he's in a big scary suit of armor. The show has plenty of humor as well as phenomenal character development. None of them are without a story or feeling. The whole message of the show is what does it mean to be human and what are you willing to sacrifice. I would like to say the English cast is the best I've ever heard by the way. I would also like to give this a pg-13 rating and and say you will love it. i totally let all my love for FMA  out so this ran a little long  so bye hope i was of some help!",5,My new favorite show!,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,1810,"['bought', 'while', 'ago', 'wanted', 'finish', 'first', 'season', 'review', 'Full', 'metal', 'Alchemist', 'new', 'favorite', 'series', 'title', 'story', 'Edward', 'Alphonse', 'Elric', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'i', 'know', 'sounds', 'cliched', 'right', 'well', 'not', 'there', 'mother', 'dying', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'pain', 'have', 'carry', 'chain', 'event', 'things', 'begin', 'series', 'two', 'are', 'alchemist', 'who', 'can', 'transform', 'things', 'trans', 'mutate', 'metal', 'objects', 'turn', 'want', 'mother', 'two', 'decide', 'want', 'bring', 'here', 'back', 'life', 'using', 'alchemy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exchange', 'anything', 'human', 'life', 'two', 'pay', 'up', 'dearly', 'mistake', 'Edward', 'older', 'one', 'right', 'arm', 'left', 'foot', 'Alphonse', 'younger', 'whole', 'body', 'Ed', 'quick', 'feet', 'brother', 'soul', 'suit', 'armor', 'could', 'save', 'though', 'transformers', 'when', 'saw', 'Al', 'cover', ""'ll"", 'be', 'shocked', 'two', 'brothers', 'start', 'quest', 'find', 'philosopher', 'stone', 'high', 'level', 'alchemy', 'get', 'missing', 'body', 'parts', 'back', 'whole', 'anime', 'full', 'amazing', 'characters', 'Edward', 'funny', 'stubborn', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'cool', 'Alphonse', 'more', 'childish', 'sympathetic', 'one', 'so', 'ironic', 'big', 'scary', 'suit', 'armor', 'show', 'plenty', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'phenomenal', 'character', 'development', 'None', 'are', 'story', 'feeling', 'whole', 'message', 'show', 'what', 'mean', 'be', 'human', 'what', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'English', 'cast', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'way', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'give', 'pg-13', 'rating', 'say', 'will', 'love', 'i', 'totally', 'let', 'love', 'FMA', 'out', 'so', 'ran', 'little', 'long', 'so', 'bye', 'hope', 'i', 'was', 'help']",Fullmetal Alchemist: Season 1

The animation is greatly different between the two as well though the overall basic animation for the characters is the same there are some major difference in design as well.

The show is engaging from the start: the plot centers around the Edward and Alfonse Elrich -- two brothers in an alternate world (similar to pre-World War I Germany) where alchemy is possible. The boys end up paying an unexpected price when they perform a forbidden ""human alchemy"" experiment to resurrect their dead mother. The process costs Edward his an arm and his leg and his brother, Alfonse's body. He manages to attach his brother's soul to a suit of armor. The brothers begin a search for the Philosopher's Stone to return their bodies to normal.The adventures the two brothers face had me sitting on the edge of my seats. The world they live in is convincingly real, and the artwork and music is spectacular. The anime puts you through every emotion possible --laughter, warmth, heartache and tears ... with an unexpected ending that will leave many tearful. If the rumors are true, and a sequel television series is planned for this series (crosses fingers) I'll be first in line to buy it.This is only the first season (25 episodes).
