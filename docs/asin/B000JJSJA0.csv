Looking at the cover you can see it is packed with actors that have been doing 'this' for awhile now and know their way around a set. With the exception of one, that being Mark Thompson. This movie is actually his brainchild, his blood, sweat and tears if you will. And after watching it you will never believe that this is his first starring turn in a movie. He has done tons of very small parts on various tv shows and movies, including his own tv show on NBC in the early 90's but he is probably more famous for his voice. He is one half of the Mark and Brian Radio Show eminating from Los Angeles and broadcasting over the US. The aforementioned show he starred in for NBC was The Adventures of Mark and Brian and was the very 1st, THE VERY FIRST, reality TV show. His acting, his performance is the one you will be talking about long after the credits have ended.",5,Fantastic performances,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,969,"['Ghost', 'one', 'little', 'movies', 'sneaks', 'up', 'truely', 'catches', 'surprise', 'Looking', 'cover', 'can', 'see', 'packed', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'doing', ""'this"", 'awhile', 'now', 'know', 'way', 'set', 'exception', 'one', 'being', 'Mark', 'Thompson', 'movie', 'actually', 'brainchild', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'will', 'watching', 'will', 'never', 'believe', 'first', 'starring', 'turn', 'movie', 'done', 'tons', 'very', 'small', 'parts', 'various', 'tv', 'shows', 'movies', 'including', 'own', 'tv', 'show', 'NBC', 'early', '90', 'probably', 'more', 'famous', 'voice', 'one', 'half', 'Mark', 'Brian', 'Radio', 'Show', 'eminating', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'broadcasting', 'US', 'aforementioned', 'show', 'starred', 'NBC', 'was', 'Adventures', 'Mark', 'Brian', 'was', 'very', '1st', 'VERY', 'FIRST', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'acting', 'performance', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'ended']",Mother Ghost

I had not heard of this movie but caught it on one of my movie channels when checking upcoming movies and was floored by the acting, the story line, directing, everything!  I knew I had to get the DVD. It's a must see and especially poignant to anyone dealing with a loss, which is everyone at some point.  I admire how they tackled and portrayed this topic.  I have watched it several times since I purchased it and it feels the same way every time, heartwarming, heart wrenching, eye-opening with unbelievable acting.  All the actors did a wonderful job, but Mark Thompson's acting was riveting and filled with emotion and he made you feel that emotion and amazing veteran actor Kevin Pollak's acting was right-on as the psychiatrist, extremely touching.  It was an amazing movie, one I will never forget.
