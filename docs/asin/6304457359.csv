423498,A7OM80F804A1U,6304457359,"Amazon Customer ""oscar_freak""","[10, 11]","This is easily one of my favorite movies. Huston takes the standard 1930s-40s &quot;Hollywood Empire&quot; movie (a la GUNGA DIN, WEE WILLIE WINKIE) and brings it up to date--to the 1880s. The true face of British  imperialism, in its good and evil, is brought to light through the actions  of two extremely human ex-sergeants in a remote Central Asian kingdom.  Connery and Caine make a terrific pair, and probably should have been  nominated (and tied) for Best Actor Oscars that year. Christopher Plummer  is good in his limited roles as Rudyard Kipling (I cannot believe that this  same guy has played Erwin Rommel, Inca Emperor Atahualpa, the Duke of  Wellington, Rudyard Kipling, AND MIKE WALLACE! ), but I should also  mention the terrific Indian actor Saeed Jaffrey, who plays the Gurkha  renegade Billy Fish (while admittedly looking more Indian than Gurkha), and  who has appeared in a number of other good movies, including GANDHI, A  PASSAGE TO INDIA, and MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE. Maurice Jarre's music is  outstanding. I can't bring myself to imagine what this movie would have  been like had Huston made it with Bogart and Gable like he intended in the  early 1950s (I love Bogart, but COME ON).",5,"The perfect pair, and Saeed Jaffrey, too!",957312000,"05 3, 2000",2000,1209,"['easily', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Huston', 'standard', '1930s-40s', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'Empire', 'quot', 'movie', 'la', 'GUNGA', 'DIN', 'WEE', 'WILLIE', 'WINKIE', 'up', 'date', '1880s', 'true', 'face', 'British', 'imperialism', 'good', 'evil', 'brought', 'light', 'actions', 'two', 'extremely', 'human', 'ex-sergeants', 'remote', 'Central', 'Asian', 'kingdom', 'Connery', 'Caine', 'make', 'terrific', 'pair', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'tied', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscars', 'year', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'good', 'limited', 'roles', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'same', 'guy', 'played', 'Erwin', 'Rommel', 'Inca', 'Emperor', 'Atahualpa', 'Duke', 'Wellington', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'AND', 'MIKE', 'WALLACE', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'terrific', 'Indian', 'actor', 'Saeed', 'Jaffrey', 'who', 'Gurkha', 'renegade', 'Billy', 'Fish', 'admittedly', 'looking', 'more', 'Indian', 'Gurkha', 'who', 'appeared', 'number', 'other', 'good', 'movies', 'including', 'GANDHI', 'A', 'PASSAGE', 'TO', 'INDIA', 'MY', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'LAUNDRETTE', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'music', 'outstanding', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'imagine', 'what', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Huston', 'made', 'Bogart', 'Gable', 'intended', 'early', '1950s', 'love', 'Bogart', 'COME', 'ON']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS
423499,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304457359,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I love movies that are just a great big bucket full of yet still manage to be very smart in their internal direction.  `The Man Who Would Be King' is just that movie.  It has the perfect mix of humor, adventure and intelligence that makes for an unbelievably entertaining and rewarding movie experience.This is a total crowd pleaser.The film follows two British soldiers, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, who are on the lookout for fame, fortune and power.  After they devise a plan to acquire great wealth they make their way to Kafiristan in order to con the people into making them kings.  While their plan seems to work (through an unintentional accident that gets misinterpreted in all the wrong ways) it also starts to take its toll, especially on Daniel, the presumed deity.It's within the final section of the film where the smart scripting plays well into the hands of the two leads, especially Connery, who embellishes his characters power driven madness in ways that bring the film to a whole other level.  It transcends the boundaries of your typical comedy/buddy flick and becomes a strong political statement to the burdens of that `quest for power'.There is rarely an on screen pairing as delightfully fulfilled as the pairing of Michael Caine and Sean Connery.  Both actors are divine in their own right, but here, together, they deliver such complete performances; strong in comedy as well as human drama.  They capture both sides of their characters so well; the drive to succeed and the fear of that said success.  In that final stretch we see whole new sides to these two men as they are pitted against one another in ways they didn't expect; and as Daniel's head begins to swell with his newfound power we see Peachy finally understanding the weight of their foolishness.  These two actors capture these emotions so well and deliver such laughs that I'm moved to label this quite possibly the greatest on screen duo ever, but that is always subject to change.Just note that they are amazing together.Director John Huston does a smart and effective job of bringing Rudyard Kipling's short story to life, filling it with a life all its own.  This is funny, sweet, poignant and totally unforgettable.  With impressive cinematography, witty banter and a meaningful tale, `The Man Who Would Be King' is nothing short of complete.",5,A very moving and totally engrossing adventure...,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,2347,"['love', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'big', 'bucket', 'full', 'yet', 'still', 'manage', 'be', 'very', 'smart', 'internal', 'direction', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'just', 'movie', 'perfect', 'mix', 'humor', 'adventure', 'intelligence', 'unbelievably', 'entertaining', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'experience.This', 'total', 'crowd', 'pleaser.The', 'film', 'two', 'British', 'soldiers', 'Daniel', 'Dravot', 'Peachy', 'Carnehan', 'who', 'are', 'lookout', 'fame', 'fortune', 'power', 'devise', 'plan', 'acquire', 'great', 'wealth', 'make', 'way', 'Kafiristan', 'order', 'con', 'people', 'making', 'kings', 'plan', 'work', 'unintentional', 'accident', 'misinterpreted', 'wrong', 'ways', 'also', 'take', 'toll', 'especially', 'Daniel', 'presumed', 'deity.It', 'final', 'section', 'film', 'where', 'smart', 'scripting', 'plays', 'well', 'hands', 'two', 'leads', 'especially', 'Connery', 'who', 'characters', 'power', 'driven', 'madness', 'ways', 'bring', 'film', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'boundaries', 'typical', 'comedy/buddy', 'flick', 'strong', 'political', 'statement', 'burdens', 'quest', ""power'.There"", 'rarely', 'screen', 'pairing', 'delightfully', 'fulfilled', 'pairing', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'actors', 'are', 'divine', 'own', 'right', 'here', 'together', 'deliver', 'such', 'complete', 'performances', 'strong', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'human', 'drama', 'capture', 'sides', 'characters', 'so', 'well', 'drive', 'succeed', 'fear', 'said', 'success', 'final', 'stretch', 'see', 'whole', 'new', 'sides', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'pitted', 'one', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Daniel', 'head', 'swell', 'newfound', 'power', 'see', 'Peachy', 'finally', 'understanding', 'weight', 'foolishness', 'two', 'actors', 'capture', 'emotions', 'so', 'well', 'deliver', 'such', 'laughs', ""'m"", 'moved', 'label', 'quite', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'screen', 'duo', 'ever', 'always', 'subject', 'change.Just', 'note', 'are', 'amazing', 'together.Director', 'John', 'Huston', 'smart', 'effective', 'job', 'bringing', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'short', 'story', 'life', 'filling', 'life', 'own', 'funny', 'sweet', 'poignant', 'totally', 'unforgettable', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'witty', 'banter', 'meaningful', 'tale', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'nothing', 'short', 'complete']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS

423503,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6304457359,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 6/14Rate: 106/14: The Man Who Would Be King is a first-rate entertainment in the hands of John Huston. Do not ever expect anything less from him because he always has a great yarn of a tale to tell. Michael Caine and Sean Connery deliver some of the best stuff of their careers in the film. The film is quite elevated by their performances and even more so by Rudyard Kipling&#8217;s short story. Although there are many terrific scenes during The Man Who Would Be King, its ending probably puts the final stamp of the film&#8217;s greatness. My favorite Michael Caine scene of the film is when he tells Sean Connery to excuse him while he falls down on the floor and laughs at him like an eight year old boy. Right there, he breaks the rules of acting and steals the moment. Sean Connery slowly comes out of his shell and takes over the film in the long run when his character&#8217;s destiny is being revealed. He has never been this good until Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Notice Roxanne as her character had been chosen as the wife of the king. Well, that&#8217;s Michael Caine&#8217;s current wife. Here is a wikipedia trivia about how this came to be: After seeing Baksh in a television advertisement for Maxwell House coffee, &#8216;British actor Michael Caine became obsessed with finding the woman he considered to be &#8216;the most beautiful... he had ever seen.&#8217;&#8221; Believe it or not, the guy who played the high priest was actually 103 years old during the filming.

One of the greatest directors of all-time (John Huston), an all-star cast: Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer and Saeed jaffrey, and an incredibly original storyline incorporating ancient Masonic mysteries, exotic locations and crisp, witty dialogue. This is a story I wish I had written! Even more delightful, it meets all expectations!Rudyard Kipling (Plummer) finds an unexpected guest awaiting his presence in his darkened study one night. Without proper introductions the hooded intruder begins to share with Kipling a fantastic tale of adventure and discovery from a faraway land that many thought only existed in myth and legend. The study of the famous writer soon disappears as we are taken along with the mysterious narrator on a fantastic journey to a foreign land.We are now introduced to Daniel Dravot (Connery) and Peachy Carnehan (Caine), two ex-British soldiers and Masonic brothers turn fortune hunters. Seeking fame and fortune they are about to undertake the adventure of a lifetime. Their destination, the Far East in search of the legendary lost treasure of Alexander the Great.And what an adventure it is! As Daniel and Peachy work their way across the vast Indian landscape towards the remote region of Kafiristan they encounter the usual severe natural hardships and hostile inhabitants as you might expect. However it's the discovery of an archaic religious cult that happens to share many of the same symbols and beliefs found in their own Masonic brotherhood that really makes them begin to wonder. As they unravel the secret origin of this esoteric connection they are faced with the truth behind a two thousand year old secret concerning Alexander the Great and his mythical lost treasure.Great film from '75. It may seem a little dated to young viewers, but give it a chance and you won't regret it!

423514,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,6304457359,Brian,"[8, 8]","It's difficult to distill in a paragraph or two the pure joy of watching John Huston's 'The Man Who Would Be King.'  All the wit and prosaic grandeur of Kipling's story (simple plot, infinitely complex theme of Man athwart Civilization) is there, expertly transposed from the page into imagery and dialogue, with the addition of stunning location photography (shot primarily in Morocco's Atlas Mountains), a rich and colorful raft of extras, and pitch-perfect chemistry between Caine and Connery-- and every fine detail of it rendered with seeming effortlessness by a master filmmaker, who for more than a decade previously had been written off creatively.

The Kipling story is one of his best and the acting, directing, sets, music, and all other aspects of this movie are first class. Any fan of ""Gunga Din"" or the ""The Four Feathers"" will love it.Our story starts out with Michael Caine, playing Peachy Carnehan, stealing Christopher Plummer's, playing Rudyard Kipling, watch. When he realizes the gold charm attached to it shows him to be a Free Mason he tries to return it. It is interesting how that little Free Mason charm changes the lives of Sean Connery, playing Daniel Dravot, and Peachy.Daniel and Peachy seek their fortune in a small country across deserts and mountains from India. No one has made the journey and survived to tell about it. They decide they will be kings and not drink or be familiar with women until they have reached that goal. They ask Kipling to witness their contract before their departure.Once the two set off with a couple pack animals and some guns and ammunition, the adventures and dangers the two encounter are amazing. The sprawling landscapes and cultures they see keep us mesmerized. It is not what they expected and so it also is not predictable what will befall them. A wonderful adventure worth seeing.Second, can someone explain why there are a handful of DVDs like this that require you to flip them over halfway into the movie? I absolutely hate that. Fortunately I only have a couple movies that require me to do that but it needs to changed.There is no excuse for it as far as I can see since I have many movies that are longer that do not require me to flip them over. Furthermore neither of those I own give you any warning that you need to flip them, they just stop and the screen goes black. Consider boycotting this method of releasing movies.

Although the acting is, indeed, flawless and exhilarating as others have noted, it is finally the totality of the film that is so outstanding. The story, of course, is brilliantly conceived by Kipling, filled with irony and pathos, a superb celebration and denunciation of Empire and its central conceit. No doubt, Huston had this one tucked in his back pocket for years. As with other Huston films, this is a story about men, their friendships, their betrayals. The story reminds me of Huston's earlier film ""The Misfits, "" starring Clarke Gable and Monte Clift. There, too, we find old friends tested by the presence of a beautiful woman. In the Kipling story, there is far more humor, a breezy quality that must have to do with the superb performances of Caine and Connery. The setting is, of course, half the wonder.

One so emotionally moving and involving I have a very hard time watching it, but then I likely hold the Guinness records on repeat views for Braveheart...so I tell myself I won't watch it again, but end up doing it.Based on a Rudyard Kipling story, it is full of exotic locates, adventure, and such warm humour, under the master John Houston's direction. Houston had this in mind originally for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart (not to knock them, but total miscasting), then later was going to do it with Butch and Sundance (Paul Newman and Robert Redford in typically Hollywood style of going for names rather than perfect actors for the roles). Fortunately, Newman had the insight to pass on it and suggested going with the pairing that was absolute perfect as Danny and Peachy.Caine had showed as Bromhead in Zulu, that he had the proper mien for a man in a red coat and pith helmet, and we know Connery can do anything given the crack. Since both are personal friends off screen, their on screen charisma comes is amplified by the fact the two men who actually like each other, giving good foundation in which to bring Danny and Peachy alive.Danny and Peachy decide they have had enough with soldering for the British Empire and think it a marvellous idea to go forth into the world and find a forgotten corner and create their own,and the most forgotten place they can find on the map is Kafiristan.

423537,AVCRD98TH48RN,6304457359,D. Knouse,"[4, 4]","4.5 stars. This is my favorite film from director John Huston.  Running a close second is his classic film &quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre.&quot;  What sets this adventure film apart from most is the extraordinary production value.  There are lavish costumes and huge, colorful sets; and the great photography captures it all in fine detail.  Also, the two lead actors played by Michael Caine and Sean Connery give two of their best performances ever.  That is praise, indeed, for two future Oscar winners.  Sean Connery won for &quot;The Untouchables,&quot; and Michael Caine won twice, once for &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; and another for &quot;The Cider House Rules.&quot;  Both actors are superb here, using subtelty and terrific use of a grand screenplay.  Also, Christopher Plummer gives another professional performance as the correspondent of The Northern Star, Rudyard Kipling. This movie is based on the story of the same name written by Rudyard Kipling and is, in effect, a period film from a more naive era.  There was a plot flaw, albeit minor.  Sean Connery, for a good portion of the film is revered as a god because his subjects did not see him bleed when struck in the chest by an arrow.  The reason is explained soonafter for the audience, but I have a question: Do gods not have other bodily functions, such as relieving oneself?  Wouldn't that have made him seem less like a god and more like the rest of his followers?  I know I'm nitpicking an otherwise great film, and this small flaw is easy to ignore.  This is a fantastic movie with fine acting,  and is one of the last truly epic works of the legendary John Huston.",4,&quot;God's Holy Trousers!&quot;,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,1652,"['4.5', 'stars', 'favorite', 'film', 'director', 'John', 'Huston', 'Running', 'close', 'second', 'classic', 'film', 'quot', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre.', 'quot', 'What', 'adventure', 'film', 'apart', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'production', 'value', 'are', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'huge', 'colorful', 'sets', 'great', 'photography', 'captures', 'fine', 'detail', 'Also', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'played', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'give', 'two', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'praise', 'indeed', 'two', 'future', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'won', 'quot', 'Untouchables', 'quot', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'won', 'twice', 'once', 'quot', 'Hannah', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules.', 'quot', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'here', 'using', 'subtelty', 'terrific', 'use', 'grand', 'screenplay', 'Also', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'professional', 'performance', 'correspondent', 'Northern', 'Star', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'movie', 'based', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'effect', 'period', 'film', 'more', 'naive', 'era', 'was', 'plot', 'flaw', 'minor', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'good', 'portion', 'film', 'revered', 'god', 'subjects', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'bleed', 'when', 'struck', 'chest', 'arrow', 'reason', 'explained', 'soonafter', 'audience', 'have', 'question', 'Do', 'gods', 'not', 'have', 'other', 'bodily', 'functions', 'such', 'relieving', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'seem', 'less', 'god', 'more', 'rest', 'followers', 'know', ""'m"", 'nitpicking', 'otherwise', 'great', 'film', 'small', 'flaw', 'easy', 'ignore', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'fine', 'acting', 'one', 'last', 'truly', 'epic', 'works', 'legendary', 'John', 'Huston']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS

423541,A2GYCEAZYQ0ZUY,6304457359,Dr. Robert F. Knoll,"[0, 0]","John Huston believed that, if a director cast the right actors, a large part of the filmmaking was done before the cameras ever rolled. In his 46 year career, Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor (&#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34;,1941), Bogart and Walter Huston (&#34;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&#34;,1948), Bogart and Katharine Hepburn (&#34;The African Queen&#34;,1951),on through Jack Nicholson, Kathleen Turner and Anjelica Huston (&#34;Prizzi's Honor&#34;, 1985) and Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann (in the director's final film, &#34;The Dead&#34; (1987), proved the wisdom of the director's choices.When John Huston began his late career renaissance in the 1970's, he was able to work with a perfect duo, Sean Connery and Michael Caine, in the 19th century Kiplingesque bromance, &#34;The Man Who Would Be King&#34; (1975).  And what a perfect pairing the Scot Connery (the best loved of all the James Bonds) and the Cockney Caine (everyone from &#34;Alfie&#34; to Alfred, the Dark Knight's butler/surrogate father) make. In my personal film pantheon of the past half century, only Paul Newman and Robert Redford in &#34;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#34; (1969) and &#34;The Sting&#34; (1973) offer brusque masculinity and emotional gradation comparable to Connery and Caine's. They're in perfect step throughout the film, even lighting each other's cigar simultaneously. Then there was that Best Supporting Actor handoff from Caine to Connery at the 1988 Academy Award ceremony.&#34;The Man Who Would Be King&#34; is, like its Kiplingesque predecessor, &#34;Gunga Din&#34; (1939), a celebration of imperialism, both material and racial. &#34;Kafiristan&#34;, the film's thinly veiled stand-in for Afghanistan, exists only so that two greedy, if likeable, con artists and former members of Her Majesty's forces in India can, in the words of Daniel Dravot (Connery), &#34;loot the country four ways from Sunday.&#34; The treasure that they stumble upon, and to which their Masonic insignia gives them access, was originally accumulated by Alexander the Great, the ur imperialist. Alexander, according to the film's cheeky script, was also the ur Mason. Who knew?The tribal divisions which are very much in evidence in today's Afghanistan and which have thwarted efforts at control by the ancient Greeks, the British Raj, the Russians, the Taliban and, to some extent, the Americans, play both humorous and brutal roles in the film's narrative. The various tribes urinate downstream while their enemies are bathing or doing laundry; the sport of choice involves playing polo with the decapitated head of one's enemy. The one Asian with a significant role is Billy Fish (Saeed Jaffrey),who speaks a fractured English learned during his time  serving first in the British military and then as the translator for the Connery and Caine characters. An earlier figure of fun was an Indian businessman who, after spitting watermelon seeds on the floor of a railway carriage, is unceremoniously thrown off the train.One has to admire the courage and fortitude of the Connery and Caine characters, if not their moral flaws which include cultural condescension, greed and undue self regard. This last is especially true of Dravot who believes his own mythmaking and thinks that indeed he is the long lost descendant of Alexander. He can therefore marry his own Roxanne (the drop dead gorgeous Shakira Caine, Michael's wife) and father a long line of kings. The original Alexander may have died over 300 years before Christ was born but his after life includes Steven Spielberg's &#34;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&#34; (1989) and Oliver Stone's &#34;Alexander' (2005).All the technical aspects of &#34;The Man Who Would Be King&#34; are first rate and earned Oscar nominations for art direction/set decoration, costumes(Edith Head) and film editing, as did the Huston/Gladys Hill script. The desolate grandeur of Morocco and the stunning glacial beauty of France's Mt. Chamonix, lovingly rendered by Oswald Morris' cameras, make impressive stand-ins for the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas. Maurice Jarre, master of widescreen epic romantic scores from &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; (1962) to &#34;Doctor Zhivago&#34; (1965) to &#34;A Passage to India&#34; (1984), provides the appropriately colorful, expansive and pseudo-ethnic flavoring.As a rabid Blu-ray collector, I especially appreciate the care that Warner Brothers took with this 2011 re-issue. It's encased in a small hard bound book which features superlative film stills, shots of cast and crew, costume sketches and mini-biographies of the major players before and behind the cameras.Well

It is time for Warner's Home Video to honor him by re-mastering The Man Who Would Be King with half way decent sound -- sound that would give his music at least half a chance.  I would give this DVD 5 stars if they hadn't sabotaged it with weak and thin sound.  Here is an excerpt from my earlier comment comparing the DVD sound to the original theatrical sound mix:What is going on with the sound? It's not just me! ""A Customer,"" ""UncleTom,"" and Connie M. Ash all wrote about this.  In the San Francisco theatrical release, which I saw repeatedly, the sound was magnificent, the orchestra was forward, as it should be with a score like this, and I'd almost swear it was in stereo! I was an audiophile at the time, as were my friends, and it would have been a topic of conversation at the time if a score this magnificent had been in squeaky, thin mono. Indeed, the IMDb entry for ""Sound Mix"" reads ""4-Track Stereo,"" which would be usual for a 35mm 2.35:1 release in 1975. True, some multichannel films were mixed down to mono for release in the boonies in those days, and sometimes the result was a careless, thin mix. Depending on the recording technique, phase cancellation can come into play making matters even worse; they lost most of the brass section in the chase sequence when they mixed the multitrack A Funny Thing Happened on the way to the Forum into mono. Can I believe that the DVD people would fail to obtain a stereo version of The Man Who Would Be King? I can.Even if it turns out that the original theatrical version was released in mono only -- but magnificent mono that fooled us all -- the original music elements may have been recorded in stereo. If so, some restorer could go back to those elements as has been done with some other films being prepared for DVD release. Soon, I hope!So, what if mono is all there is? I believe the elements could be mixed into a relatively rich, full soundtrack by someone with talent, who cares",3,The composer is dead -- let's honor him,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,2117,"['Maurice', 'Jarre', 'composer', 'marvelous', 'score', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'be', 'King', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'many', 'other', 'fine', 'films', 'died', 'yesterday', 'time', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'honor', 're-mastering', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'sound', 'sound', 'would', 'give', 'music', 'least', 'chance', 'would', 'give', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'had', ""n't"", 'sabotaged', 'weak', 'thin', 'sound', 'Here', 'excerpt', 'earlier', 'comment', 'comparing', 'DVD', 'sound', 'original', 'theatrical', 'sound', 'mix', 'What', 'going', 'sound', 'not', 'just', 'Customer', 'UncleTom', 'Connie', 'M.', 'Ash', 'wrote', 'San', 'Francisco', 'theatrical', 'release', 'saw', 'repeatedly', 'sound', 'was', 'magnificent', 'orchestra', 'was', 'forward', 'should', 'be', 'score', ""'d"", 'almost', 'swear', 'was', 'stereo', 'was', 'audiophile', 'time', 'were', 'friends', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'topic', 'conversation', 'time', 'score', 'magnificent', 'had', 'been', 'squeaky', 'thin', 'mono', 'Indeed', 'IMDb', 'entry', 'Sound', 'Mix', '4-Track', 'Stereo', 'would', 'be', 'usual', '35mm', '2.35:1', 'release', '1975', 'True', 'multichannel', 'films', 'were', 'mixed', 'down', 'mono', 'release', 'boonies', 'days', 'sometimes', 'result', 'was', 'careless', 'thin', 'mix', 'Depending', 'recording', 'technique', 'phase', 'cancellation', 'can', 'come', 'play', 'making', 'matters', 'even', 'worse', 'lost', 'most', 'brass', 'section', 'chase', 'sequence', 'when', 'mixed', 'multitrack', 'A', 'Funny', 'Thing', 'Happened', 'way', 'Forum', 'mono', 'Can', 'believe', 'DVD', 'people', 'would', 'fail', 'obtain', 'stereo', 'version', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'can.Even', 'out', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'mono', 'only', 'magnificent', 'mono', 'fooled', 'original', 'music', 'elements', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'stereo', 'so', 'restorer', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'elements', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'films', 'being', 'prepared', 'DVD', 'release', 'Soon', 'hope', 'So', 'what', 'mono', 'believe', 'elements', 'could', 'be', 'mixed', 'relatively', 'rich', 'full', 'soundtrack', 'someone', 'talent', 'who']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS

423560,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,6304457359,H. Snyder,"[7, 7]","Rudyard Kipling's story from nineteenth-century India is brought brilliantly to the screen in this 1975 film.  It is a story that director John Huston had been trying to film for decades. He first envisioned Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart as the two British soldiers who would establish an empire in the unknown lands north of the Khyber Pass, but it would be nearly 25 years later that Huston's vision became a reality.It should be no surprise that The Man Who Would Be King was an enormous success, given the lineup of talent: director John Huston of Maltese Falcon and African Queen fame, British actors Sean Connery and Michael Caine as the soldiers of fortune, and Canadian actor Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling.  Typical of Kipling, his story is brimming with adventure and local color, all of which the film employs to great effect.  The author was a character in his own story, although not by name as he is in the film. In the story, as in reality, he was a newspaper reporter and a brother in The Craft, the Masonic Order, which figures prominently in the film.The tale has the elements of a Greek tragedy, with overweening pride and ambition being first rewarded with amazing success, only to be subsequently punished with divine retribution. Through it all the protagonists are loveable scoundrels, facing with humor and courage the bureaucrats of British India and the warring factions of Afghanistan and ""Kafiristan"", winning over the locals by military skill and a fortuitous coincidence of fictional ancient history, then losing it all with courageous grace.The Man Who Would Be King is a great story, re-told by one of the greatest Hollywood storytellers directing some of the finest actors of the time. I was delighted to see this, one of my all-time favorites, become available in high definition. The DVD of this superb film was peculiar, requiring that the disc be turned over part way through the movie, and displaying marginal picture quality that was painful to watch on a large-screen television.

423567,AFMWLT45X9H4R,6304457359,Jim Toms,"[26, 29]","This is an exceptional treat with two great actors in Connery and Caine and a great director in Huston, who seems to have been born to make just such a film.  Based on a short story by Rudyard Kipling (who is played exceptionally by Christopher Plummer in the film), The Man Who Would Be King tells the story of two former British soldiers in India who devise a scheme to go to neighboring Kafiristan, set themselves up as royalty and then loot the country for all they can carry back home.  After running into bandits on the way, enduring freezing temperatures and with a little unintended help from an avalanche, the two meet Billy Fish who gets them set up where they would like to be in Kafiristan.  Eventually, and you can see how and why for yourself, Connery comes to be regarded by the locals as a god. This will have its advantages for Connery and Caine, but in the end will be their downfall (no pun intended for those who have already seen the film).... I saw nothing of poor quality myself. The picture seemed crisp and sound quality was acceptable as well.  Here's the negative: unless anything has changed with the manufacturing of the disc itself, one has to flip the disc over about halfway through the film.  That's right.  A *and* B sides.  While I would prefer that the film be continuous all the way through, the fact that it isn't is not enough to give the DVD a negative review.Also, there are some good extras here. There's a lot of ""on location"" and extra info about things that went on during the making of the film as well as a ""making of"" featurette (only about ten or fifteen minutes long). The featurette is nothing exceptional but it does show you what Connery landed on and how the entire cast and crew agonized over the bridge scene at the end of the film. It's also fun to see Connery sitting around in a camouflage hat on the set with the blood on his face that was so important to the story at the end of the film. You also get  theatrical trailers for eight of Huston's films.

As an adventure, it far exceeds the wildly more popular but childish Indiana Jones series.This  movie follows the adventure of Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, two  rakish ne'er-do-wells in the British Army in India.  They leave the  service, and, alone, they pack guns and supplies and head north to  Kafiristan, a distant and mysterious land they've only heard tales about,  to become Kings, and plunder the kingdom.When they arrive, they pit  warring communities against each other.  During battle, Connery's character  is mistaken for a god when he is shot (in his leather bandolier), and  doesn't bleed.  As a result, he is made King. He is brought to the Holy  City, where the holy men mistake him for &quot;Son of Sekander,&quot; that  is, the Son of Alexander The Great.  They prostrate themselves before him,  and give him access to Alexander's treasure, which they have guarded for  centuries.Instead of taking the money and running, however, Connery  gets big-headed, gets to liking the role of King, and wants to stay and  administer his kingdom, which he does, and does well, it seems.As you  would expect, that's not the end of the story...but I don't want to give  any more away.This movie is also humorous.

423571,A2G2Y4XPXYL84M,6304457359,John Smith,"[10, 10]","Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  ""The Man Who Would Be King"" is based on a Rudyard Kipling short story of the same title.  I've never read that story, so I can't say how faithful the film is.  I will say that Christopher Plummer (as Kipling) gives the strongest performance of the lead cast, despite having the least amount of screen time by far.  The basic plot: circa 1880 India, two former British soldiers and ne'er-do-wells hatch a crazy scheme to conquer Kafiristan (basically, northern Afghanistan).  They plan to loot the country of all its wealth, return to England, and retire as rich gentlemen.  Do they succeed?  You'll just have to watch the movie.  The moral of this story is ""quit while you're ahead""...which is kind of ironic, given the final scene.Two differences I've noticed in this edition (and the DVD) compared the VHS release.  The first is the scene where our heroes meet Billy Fish for the first time.  In the original, Billy yells, ""You just wait one jiffy!""  This dialogue is absent, as is the short sequence where the crown falls from Connery's head.  Even so, the movie is as good as it ever was, and I highly recommend it.  There is some violence, but little blood (at least by today's standards), and two scenes of very brief (rear) nudity.  Although this is not the best Blu-ray transfer I've watched, it stands far above any of its predecessors in A/V quality, so it's worth upgrading; this is especially true of the beautiful landscape vistas, which can now be seen in their full glory (BTW, it's 16x9 widescreen).  One thing that annoyed me about the dvd version is that you had to switch sides to view the whole film, and that issue has been resolved.Special features are minimal: a theatrical trailer, and ""Call it magic: the making of The Man Who Would Be King,"" which I found uninteresting.  However, the dvd booklet is attractive and well done.  You'll get a three page history of how the movie came to fruition; one page bios of Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer, and John Huston; and a two page bio of Kipling and his work.  The booklet also contains many production photos and artwork.I really liked this film; while mostly a tale of adventure, it's also warning about how hubris can destroy one's goals even after achieving them, and drag one's friends down as well.

423573,AEJAGHLC675A7,6304457359,John Williamson,"[3, 4]","Personally speaking, that classic line spoken by Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) is as memorable today as when I first saw his performance inThe Man Who Would Be Kingin 1975. It was a favorite film then as I was finishing college, and is still a personal favorite today.This film was skillfully adapted from the Rudyard Kipling short story of the same title, a tale that I had read in my youth, and the film is one that I was compelled to share with my son as he was growing up. But in my youth, it was this line from the original short story that stood out, as it did to many:""Brother to a Prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found worthy.""So begins Rudyard Kipling'sThe Man Who Would Be King, with an echo of the last verse of the Masonic verse ""Banquet Night,"" and there are quite a few references to Freemasonry in this tale, which is considered by many to be Kipling's finest short story.The author was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), in what was then British India, and he drew upon his experiences in Anglo-Indian society for much of his fiction. The winner of the 1907 Nobel Prize for Literature, he was the first English language writer to receive the coveted prize, and to date he remains its youngest recipient. He is regarded as a master of the short story, and his books for children are considered as enduring classics of children's literature.""The Man Who Would be King"" is a unforgettable tale of adventure, and is told by a first-person narrator, a newspaperman in India who one can assume is Rudyard Kipling. While on a train, he meets a fascinating opportunist: ""He was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself, but with an educated taste for whiskey. He told tales of things he had seen and done, of out-of-the-way corners of the Empire into which he had penetrated, and of adventures in which he risked his life for a few days' food.""The narrator soon learns that Daniel Dravot and his fellow vagabond, Peachey Carnehan, are both passing themselves off as journalists for the newspaper for which the narrator is a real correspondent. He is fascinated by them, but does stop them from blackmailing a minor Indian rajah.Some months later, they appear at his office in Lahore, and tell him their plan. In the words of Daniel Dravot, they have been ""Soldier, sailor, compositor, photographer, proof-reader, street-preacher, and correspondents of the 'Backwoodsman' when we thought the paper wanted one. Carnehan is sober, and so am I. Look at us first and see that's sure. It will save you cutting into my talk. We'll take one of your cigars apiece, and you shall see us light.""The pair have have decided India isn't enough for them, and the next day they will go off to Kafiristan, to set themselves up as kings. They were going through the Khaiber with a regular caravan and with Dravot disguised as a native priest, stating, ""Who'd touch a poor mad priest?"" They have twenty Martini rifles, and with their camels, they plan to find a tribal leader, help him defeat his enemies, then take over for themselves.The pair sign a ""Contrack"" (contract) as ""Gentlemen at Large,"" with the narrator as witness, in which they will together ""be Kings of Kafiristan,"" not ""look at any Liquor, nor any Woman,"" and that if one gets into trouble ""the other will stay by him."" They ask the narrator for the use of maps and books of the area, as a favor because they are fellow Freemasons, and because he spoiled their earlier blackmail scheme.Two years pass, and on a hot summer night, an almost unrecognizable Peachey Carnehan creeps into the narrator's office, a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in rags. He tells an astonishing tale of how Daniel Dravot and he had succeeded in becoming Kafiri kings, taking over villages, and building a unified nation in Kafiristan (in modern-day Afghanistan). Carnehan explains how the Kafiris (who were pagans, not Moslems) came to regard Dravot as a god, and the immortal son of Alexander the Great. The Kafiris practiced a form of Masonic ritual, and the pair secrets of Freemasons that only the oldest priest remembered.But Carnehan explains that their grand schemes were shattered when Dravot made a decision that brought their kingdom down around them. And to explain any further would spoil the final outcome of this amazing tale. The Masonic connections to the growth and demise of the British Empire have been covered by many. It's a true literary masterpiece, and it's quite apparent that Kipling was quite conscious of the fact that the British Empire of that time was not eternal.It's no wonder that the late John Huston chose Kipling's tale to create his epic 1975 filmThe Man Who Would Be King, which starred Sean Connery (Daniel Dravot), Michael Caine (Peachey Carnehan) and Christopher Plummer (Rudyard Kipling). It had a superb supporting performance from Saeed Jaffrey, along with a rare but pivotal appearance by Michael Caine's wife, Shakira. This was a film that director John Huston had planned for years, and was nominated for four Academy Awards. The film is very true to Kipling's story, but goes into less Masonic detail.One of the more interesting aspects of this tale is that it was loosely based on historical fact, of which Kipling was aware. Josiah Harlan, a Pennsylvania Quaker, journeyed to Afghanistan in the 1820s, and through a series of wheeling and dealing, was crowned the Prince of Ghor (a province in central Afghanistan). Ben Macintyre's bookThe Man Who Would Be King: The First American in Afghanistandetails his story, including Freemason Harlan trading secrets with an old Rosicrucian sorcerer in an Afghan cave, and how the the British overthrow of the sitting Afghan ruler soon forced his departure.But going back to Kipling's tale, the inevitable question arises: which is better, the movie or the book?That would be a difficult answer for this reviewer, as both have been real favorites for many years, and John Huston had gone out of his way to keep his film as true to Kipling's story as possible. Would have to say that I rate them equally, and can easily recommend both as 5-star choices. But I will admit that every once in awhile I do pick up the bookThe Man Who Would Be Kingand read it. One who has enjoyed both cannot help but remember the performances in John Huston's splendid film.10/8/2012",5,"""Not gods... Englishmen.

As rugged adventurers who are also the best of friends, Sean Connery and Michael Caine reached their career peak as Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, respectively.  But I think it's a mistake to call it an ""action movie"" or an ""epic."" For all the laughs and glamor, and the feel-good friendship of the two buddies, this movie is really a tragedy in the classical sense.Don't watch this movie expecting RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, where the good guys win and everybody leaves the story happy and alive. It's terribly important to remember that though this movie came out just one year before STAR WARS, John Huston is miles away from the infantile zap-zap action of children like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.The movie charts the downfall of two men who try to rise too high, just like Icarus in Greek myth. Rudyard Kipling felt that men who serve in the ranks should not get ""above themselves"" and wrote this story to show what happens when such people get out of their place. At the same time, Kipling was trying to warn the English people that the British Empire would only last as long as the purpose was justice rather than greed.Watching the movie, it's hard not to be torn. The two heroes fail in terms of empire building and politics, because they break faith with their native subjects one time too many. But at the same time, they never break faith with each other. The movie asks the question, can any person really be a failure if he/she has sacrificed everything for friendship? The final ""defeat"" of the pair is also final victory in that they maintain the one thing in their lives that was always above corruption -- their friendship. The bittersweet ending is complex and ambiguous, and signals that this is truly a masterpiece by giants of a nobler age.John Huston is gone now, replace by pygmies like Spielberg and Lucas.

Those were the years that the sun never set on the British Empire, and the colonialist perspective is taken for granted.It's about former British soldiers played by Sean Connery and Michael Caine, who, with twenty guns and a spirit of adventure, set out to conquer the fictional area known as Kafiristan by introducing firearms, conquering warring tribes and setting themselves up as kings in order to plunder riches.  However, when local religious leaders believe that Connery is a God, there is conflict between the two men.  Trouble follows.Filmed in Morocco with a cast of thousands, the cinematography is excellent.  John Huston sure does know how to set up a scene. There's a lot of adventure and lots of bloodshed.  And warfare orchestrated as fun and games.  None of it is politically correct, especially since everyone, with the exception of the Englishmen, are depicted an ignorant fools.  This bothered me even though I understand that the story came from another era.All the acting was uniformly good, with Christopher Plummer cast as Rudyard Kipling and Shakira Caine, a former Miss Guyana, cast as the woman who wins Connery's heart.  The DVD had one good extra, depicting the cast on location and the actual filming of one of the most outrageous and dangerous stunts.The only way to enjoy this film is not to take it too seriously and let yourself be transported into a world that not only is no more, but that never was. The story had enough twists and turns to hold my attention but it was just too dated for my taste.

Michael Caine and Sean Connery represent the kind of screen chemistry not seen since Hope and Crosby teamed up for their Road series. The real genius behind this masterpiece is John Houston's uncanny ability to combine good old fashion swashbuckling action adventure with enough warmth and good humor, sweeping panoramas and amazing Edith Head costumes to create this marvelous fantasy.The story begins in Rudyard Kiplings newspaper office, The Northern Star, where he is confronted by one Peachy Carnaham, (Michael Caine). Peachy retells of the amazing journey undertaken by him and fellow free mason, Daniel Dravot, (Sean Connery). Their quest was to become kings of the remote land of Kifirastan, by fighting and conquering waring tribes. In the process they end up with more than they bargined for. Through chance Daniel is perceived to be a God, which proves to be their undoing.But the very idea of one of the characters of Kipling's story in a sense jumping off the pages and sucking him into the action and in the end revealing how Daniel came to his demise.

423599,A1AMR2GU34OVJP,6304457359,Matthew Newland,"[4, 4]","Ah, ""The Man Who Would Be King""... one of my all-time favorite movies.  I saw it for the first time two years ago last July, after purchasing it site unseen based on its reputation alone.  The critics and everyone else I heard speaking about it were right... this is a wonderful movie, one of the greatest ever made.  Though I've never read the short story this film is based on (in spite of being an avid Kipling fan since reading ""Just So Stories"" while I was a wee lad in second grade and ""The Jungle Books"" finally two months ago) I definitely want to now, but I really can't imagine the story being told any more perfectly than it is here.Let me just tell you what I knew before I saw it.  Connery and Caine are British soldiers who devise a plan that will enable them to get stinking rich.  Up north of India, there's an isolated kingdom unvisited by white men since Alexander the Great.  Their plan?  Go to the kingdom, take it over (they've got guns), and loot the country... only things end up happening a little differently than they'd planned them to, and some tension starts to grow between the two men once they've seemingly got it all.That's it, that's all you need to know.  It was enough to make me curious enough to buy it, and I'm really glad I did.  Since that first time I've seen it several more (the night before last being the most recent), and it never gets old.  Check it out... you'll love it too.The silence of the last five minutes, which we hear between the whispered words of the two conversing characters before the film ends, is just amazing...Check out ""TMWWBK"" immediately.  The DVD's reasonably priced, and comes with a highly interesting ""the making of"" featurette.  A word of warning, though: don't watch the making of until after you've finished the movie, as it will spoil the end for you otherwise.Carry on carry on,MN",5,"""If a Greek can do it, we can do it!""",1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,1858,"['Ah', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'two', 'years', 'last', 'July', 'purchasing', 'site', 'unseen', 'based', 'reputation', 'alone', 'critics', 'everyone', 'else', 'heard', 'speaking', 'were', 'right', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'made', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'short', 'story', 'film', 'based', 'spite', 'being', 'avid', 'Kipling', 'fan', 'reading', 'Just', 'So', 'Stories', 'was', 'wee', 'lad', 'second', 'grade', 'Jungle', 'Books', 'finally', 'two', 'months', 'definitely', 'want', 'now', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'more', 'perfectly', 'here.Let', 'just', 'tell', 'what', 'knew', 'saw', 'Connery', 'Caine', 'are', 'British', 'soldiers', 'who', 'devise', 'plan', 'will', 'enable', 'get', 'stinking', 'rich', 'Up', 'north', 'India', 'isolated', 'kingdom', 'unvisited', 'white', 'men', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'plan', 'Go', 'kingdom', 'take', 'over', ""'ve"", 'got', 'guns', 'country', 'only', 'things', 'end', 'up', 'happening', 'little', 'differently', ""'d"", 'planned', 'tension', 'grow', 'two', 'men', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seemingly', 'got', 'all.That', 'need', 'know', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'curious', 'enough', 'buy', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'did', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'more', 'night', 'last', 'being', 'most', 'recent', 'never', 'old', 'Check', 'out', ""'ll"", 'love', 'too.The', 'silence', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'hear', 'whispered', 'words', 'two', 'conversing', 'characters', 'film', 'ends', 'just', 'amazing', 'Check', 'TMWWBK', 'immediately', 'DVD', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'highly', 'interesting', 'making', 'featurette', 'word', 'warning', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'making', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'movie', 'will', 'spoil', 'end', 'otherwise.Carry', 'carry', 'MN']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS

Doyle ""film buff""","[1, 4]","Telling a grim morality tale with a good amount of humor amidst settings of grandeur and a with sense of high adventure, THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING reminds me of Kipling's more famous buddy tale of exotic adventure among dangerous natives--GUNGA DIN.But here the telling is more leisurely and for awhile we don't know where the story is going. First, it seems a comedy, then the more adventurous elements take over and finally it goes for a gripping climax in which all hell breaks loose when the two con men are about to get their comeuppance.As the decidedly shady characters, corrupt and acting out of a simple desire for riches, SEAN CONNERY and MICHAEL CAINE give probably the most skillful performances of their careers. My only complaint about Caine is that sometimes his Cockney accent (spoken in a hushed voice at a key moment in the film) is hard to understand. Some post-production dubbing would have been advisable.For all of its sense of adventure, the film often plods along at a snail's pace between its more colorful episodes and could have been more tightly edited to tell its story in far less running time.Frankly, I enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek GUNGA DIN infinitely more than this Huston film. That's not to say the film is a failure. The cinematography is great and all of the performances are extremely well done--with special mention of CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER who is highly effective as Rudyard Kipling himself. His final scene is a memorable close-up after Caine has told him the truth about the harrowing end of their adventure.Although highly entertaining at times, it's easy to see why this story of two con men is not considered to be one of John Huston's greatest. By no means a failure, it nevertheless has enough flaws and is just uneven enough to make you realize it could have been a truly great adventure film.",4,"Huston does Kipling...Connery and Caine shine in ""buddy flick""...",1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,1839,"['Telling', 'grim', 'morality', 'tale', 'good', 'amount', 'humor', 'amidst', 'settings', 'grandeur', 'sense', 'high', 'adventure', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'WOULD', 'BE', 'KING', 'Kipling', 'more', 'famous', 'buddy', 'tale', 'exotic', 'adventure', 'dangerous', 'natives', 'GUNGA', 'DIN.But', 'here', 'telling', 'more', 'leisurely', 'awhile', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'First', 'comedy', 'then', 'more', 'adventurous', 'elements', 'take', 'finally', 'gripping', 'climax', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'when', 'two', 'con', 'men', 'are', 'get', 'comeuppance.As', 'decidedly', 'shady', 'characters', 'corrupt', 'acting', 'simple', 'desire', 'riches', 'SEAN', 'CONNERY', 'MICHAEL', 'CAINE', 'give', 'probably', 'most', 'skillful', 'performances', 'careers', 'only', 'complaint', 'Caine', 'sometimes', 'Cockney', 'accent', 'spoken', 'hushed', 'voice', 'key', 'moment', 'film', 'hard', 'understand', 'post-production', 'dubbing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'advisable.For', 'sense', 'adventure', 'film', 'often', 'along', 'snail', 'pace', 'more', 'colorful', 'episodes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'tightly', 'edited', 'tell', 'story', 'far', 'less', 'running', 'time.Frankly', 'enjoyed', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'GUNGA', 'DIN', 'infinitely', 'more', 'Huston', 'film', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'failure', 'cinematography', 'great', 'performances', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'special', 'mention', 'CHRISTOPHER', 'PLUMMER', 'who', 'highly', 'effective', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'final', 'scene', 'memorable', 'close-up', 'Caine', 'told', 'truth', 'harrowing', 'end', 'adventure.Although', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'times', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'story', 'two', 'con', 'men', 'not', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'John', 'Huston', 'greatest', 'failure', 'nevertheless', 'enough', 'flaws', 'just', 'uneven', 'enough', 'make', 'realize', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'great', 'adventure', 'film']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS

423609,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,6304457359,Octavius,"[4, 4]","The short story by Kipling was excquisitely adapted to film by legendary director John Huston (Treasure of the Sierra Madre.) Although it's not a high budget film; with stellar performances by Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Cristopher Plummer, it's an all time classic. The acting, story line, and superb directing by Huston more than make up for some of the film's budget-related shortcomings.Masonic brothers Danny Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine)feel that colonial India isn't big enough for men like them. Unemployed veterans of Her Majesty's Army with royal ambitions, they're out to make their own empire in distant Karfiristan; a gold-laden land of cruel savages who've never seen an Englishman or even less a rifle. The story is a great satire on the subject of imperialism in general and how the classic ploy of divide and conquer comes back to haunt the conqueror in the end.  The film follows the short story pretty well although it does both redact and add certain elements (i.e. Making Peachy steal Rudyard's watch; making Billy Fish a Guhrka instead of a Bashkai; introducing Roxanne instead of a faceless bride; redacting Peachy's trip to Kabul to get more guns, etc.) Despite these changes, the film doesn't deviate from Kipling's story so as to undermine its theme or plot: much of the dialogue is directly from the story.On a final note, Kipling had a rather low opinion of England's colonial subjects and this is strongly manifested in his works; even with the sanitizing of the story for the screenplay and script, the film is definitely not one for bleeding hearts or the politically correct variety. If you're not restricted by the latter points of view, the film is riddled with humor, adventure, and drama: a great one to own.",5,An Epic Colonial Adventure,1090540800,"07 23, 2004",2004,1777,"['short', 'story', 'Kipling', 'was', 'excquisitely', 'adapted', 'film', 'legendary', 'director', 'John', 'Huston', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'not', 'high', 'budget', 'film', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Cristopher', 'Plummer', 'time', 'classic', 'acting', 'story', 'line', 'superb', 'directing', 'Huston', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'budget-related', 'shortcomings.Masonic', 'brothers', 'Danny', 'Dravot', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Peachy', 'Carnehan', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'feel', 'colonial', 'India', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough', 'men', 'Unemployed', 'veterans', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Army', 'royal', 'ambitions', ""'re"", 'make', 'own', 'empire', 'distant', 'Karfiristan', 'gold-laden', 'land', 'cruel', 'savages', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Englishman', 'even', 'less', 'rifle', 'story', 'great', 'satire', 'subject', 'imperialism', 'general', 'how', 'classic', 'ploy', 'divide', 'conquer', 'back', 'haunt', 'conqueror', 'end', 'film', 'short', 'story', 'pretty', 'well', 'redact', 'add', 'certain', 'elements', 'i.e', 'Making', 'Peachy', 'steal', 'Rudyard', 'watch', 'making', 'Billy', 'Fish', 'Guhrka', 'instead', 'Bashkai', 'introducing', 'Roxanne', 'instead', 'faceless', 'bride', 'redacting', 'Peachy', 'trip', 'Kabul', 'get', 'more', 'guns', 'etc', 'changes', 'film', ""n't"", 'deviate', 'Kipling', 'story', 'so', 'undermine', 'theme', 'plot', 'much', 'dialogue', 'directly', 'story.On', 'final', 'note', 'Kipling', 'had', 'rather', 'low', 'opinion', 'England', 'colonial', 'subjects', 'strongly', 'manifested', 'works', 'even', 'sanitizing', 'story', 'screenplay', 'script', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'bleeding', 'hearts', 'politically', 'correct', 'variety', ""'re"", 'not', 'restricted', 'latter', 'points', 'view', 'film', 'riddled', 'humor', 'adventure', 'drama', 'great', 'one', 'own']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS

This movie was made in 1975 and you do get a sense that it is not up to the current Hollywood standard in terms of special effects, Dolby surround, computer animation, and things of that nature.  Despite this the movie still stands the test of time because of excellent performances, a good storyline, and a healthy dose of humor.First off it is based off a story by Rudyard Kipling and takes place in the hinterlands of India.  Two former English soldiers (Connery and Caine) who are basically scoundrels set out to set themselves up with fame and fortune.They set out to the where no white men have been seen before and convince he locals they are gods.  But look out anything that is too good is probably too good to be true or to last!Connery and Caine complement one another in this film very well I thought and again this is not a special effects flick this is shot with real backgrounds etc for the most part.  If you were ever curious to get a sense of Kipling without the book this might be a good film to check out!  It is also not terribly inappropriate for younger viewers, for example they make a promise to one another not to drink or chase women while on their quest.It is a period piece set in the late 1800s and depicts the railroads and remote countryside of colonial India in a day when might made right and individual adventurers could achieve glory and fortune.

I recall the publisher, an aging hippie, carping about my recommendation of a TV broadcast of a movie based on a short story by an alleged apologist for British imperialism, Rudyard Kipling. Kipling may be un-PC these days, but I wonder if my long-ago publisher actually read ""The Man Who Would Be King"" or saw the wonderful 1975 movie that director John Huston fashioned from it. If he did, he might have realized it was a clear-eyed cautionary tale, not a celebration of British incursion. ""TMWWBK"" is one of those ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"" near-classics, and watching it you're glad that Huston had to wait so long to make it, because with all due respect to the late great director, his earlier choices for the leading roles (Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Burt Lancaster and Paul Newman among them) would not have worked nearly as well as the team of Sean Connery and Michael Caine. The two actors bring authority, humor, and not a little poignancy to their roles as ex-soldiers who decide to journey to a remote, hostile Asian land and set themselves up as its rulers.Watching the DVD again recently, I was reminded of what a strong impact ""TMWWBK"" made on me as a teenager, and it has stood the test of time better than many highly-regarded movies of its day. However, my enthusiasm is muted by the fact that the DVD itself hasn't held up nearly as well. It was issued circa 1997, when so-called ""flippers"" (DVDs that made you play both sides to see the entire movie, like an LP with awkward side breaks) were not unheard-of, even with flicks that ran for only two hours like this one. Oswald Morris' handsome Panavision cinematography translated pretty cleanly to silver disc (thankfully, it's letterboxed rather than pan-and-scan), but after a decade's advancements in DVD technology, a remastering would produce a sharper picture (and would probably improve the lackluster transfer of the soundtrack, monaural though it is). Double-sided or no, the disc is very short on extras--and as has been noted elsewhere, a key moment near the end of the movie has been inexplicably deleted, or more accurately replaced with a character's narration delivered to the camera rather than as a voice-over of this sequence. The movie deserves far better, and it's a shame that this 10-year-old ""flipper"" hasn't been superceded. The high rating I'm giving this disc is for the movie itself, not for the indifferent DVD, which will have to suffice until, I hope, a better one comes along.",4,Calling for a new DVD issue,1173398400,"03 9, 2007",2007,2705,"['More', 'years', ""'d"", 'like', 'remember', 'was', '1983', 'first', 'job', 'college', 'compiled', 'edited', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'TV', 'picks', 'weekly', 'regional', 'music/arts', 'recall', 'publisher', 'aging', 'hippie', 'carping', 'recommendation', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'movie', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'alleged', 'apologist', 'British', 'imperialism', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'Kipling', 'may', 'be', 'un-PC', 'days', 'wonder', 'long-ago', 'publisher', 'actually', 'read', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'saw', 'wonderful', '1975', 'movie', 'director', 'John', 'Huston', 'fashioned', 'did', 'might', 'have', 'realized', 'was', 'clear-eyed', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'not', 'celebration', 'British', 'incursion', 'TMWWBK', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'anymore', 'near-classics', 'watching', ""'re"", 'glad', 'Huston', 'had', 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'make', 'due', 'respect', 'late', 'great', 'director', 'earlier', 'choices', 'leading', 'roles', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'team', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'two', 'actors', 'bring', 'authority', 'humor', 'not', 'little', 'poignancy', 'roles', 'ex-soldiers', 'who', 'decide', 'journey', 'remote', 'hostile', 'Asian', 'land', 'set', 'up', 'rulers.Watching', 'DVD', 'again', 'recently', 'was', 'reminded', 'what', 'strong', 'impact', 'TMWWBK', 'made', 'teenager', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'better', 'many', 'highly-regarded', 'movies', 'day', 'However', 'enthusiasm', 'muted', 'fact', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'held', 'up', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'issued', 'circa', '1997', 'when', 'so-called', 'flippers', 'DVDs', 'made', 'play', 'sides', 'see', 'entire', 'movie', 'LP', 'awkward', 'side', 'breaks', 'were', 'not', 'unheard-of', 'even', 'flicks', 'ran', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'Oswald', 'Morris', 'handsome', 'Panavision', 'cinematography', 'translated', 'pretty', 'cleanly', 'silver', 'disc', 'thankfully', 'letterboxed', 'rather', 'pan-and-scan', 'decade', 'advancements', 'DVD', 'technology', 'remastering', 'would', 'produce', 'sharper', 'picture', 'would', 'probably', 'improve', 'lackluster', 'transfer', 'soundtrack', 'monaural', 'Double-sided', 'disc', 'very', 'short', 'extras', 'been', 'noted', 'elsewhere', 'key', 'moment', 'end', 'movie', 'been', 'inexplicably', 'deleted', 'more', 'accurately', 'replaced', 'character', 'narration', 'delivered', 'camera', 'rather', 'voice-over', 'sequence', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'shame', '10-year-old', 'flipper', ""n't"", 'been', 'superceded', 'high', 'rating', ""'m"", 'giving', 'disc', 'movie', 'not', 'indifferent', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'suffice', 'hope', 'better', 'one', 'along']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS

John Huston's love & dedication to this project really shines through (he had to wait 25-30 years to make it & then almost died making it)in his script & direction. Caine & Connery ARE Peachy & Danny (I'm sorry--I can't see Bogart & Gable) in what I see as career high performances.  Some eight years ago this was one of the very first DVDs I ever purchased. After viewing it numerous times since then, I have just watched it for the first times on a 42"" widescreen lcd tv. I have to say that I was surprised at how good the image was for such an old release--the DVD was released in 1997--however there is room for considerable improvement in the package. First & foremost get rid of the flipper disc, the film is 129 minutes long & can easily be fit on a dual layer dvd with room to spare for a commentary (by a critic/historian & perhaps Mr. Caine--I doubt if Mr. Connery would make himself available.) Next, reinstate the short bit at the climax showing Danny tumbling end over end with Peach narrating his fall from the bridge--it was there when I first saw the film in 1975, but is missing from television & DVD prints for some reason. Documentary material on Kipling, the short story, John Huston & the making of the film & its importance would be most welcome. As it is, there are practically no extras on the extentant disc.

I was totally caught up in it then and I am still very impressed every time I get a chance to see it again (I have it on tape but it's a beta tape).  There is a lot of adventure, mystery, action, humor and drama wrapped up in this movie.  The sets, scenery and photography are terrific as well.  Best of all, there is also a lot of great acting and directing.  Michael Caine and Sean Connery are both excellent actors who seem to elevate their preformances a notch by working together.  There is also an excellent supporting cast.I was fascinated with the story and the concept of a tribe that had had no contact with the Western world since the time of Alexander the Great.  These two British soldiers were going to go to this land that was only rumored to exist and become their kings.  How they planned it, how they went there, how they attempted to acheive their goal (and how &quot;they&quot; came back). makes for a riveting and entertaining movie.&quot;The Man Who Would be King&quot; has become something of a cult favorite over the years.  However, don't let that mislead you.  This is no &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; that appeals only to fringe groups of movie goers.  This movie was made for all audiences and can still be enjoyed by all.  Something or other has left it off the &quot;A&quot; list of movies for the Late Show which makes it hard to find on TV.

In India, Rudyard Kipling meets 2 con men on a train, after one of them returns a watch he stole upon discovering he is a fellow Free Mason. Caine is the brains, Connery the brawn in the team.  Kipling helps them out a bit as they transition out of the military, watching their scams with amusement and a growing sense of alarm as they never quite seem to get ahead.  They set off to make their fortunes in the wild unconquered territory north of India, somewhere but not exactly in Afghanistan.  So begins an epic misadventure that delights and frightens in equal measure.On a hunch, they cross savage landscapes, fighting bandits and mountain frosts before emerging into a world that is apparently unchanged since the days of Alexander the Great, the last successful conqueror of the region.  Once arrived, they wheedle their way into the elite of the region with scarcely a thought as to the carnage they leave in their wake, acquiring hangers-on that serve as a kind of court to their scam.  What they do is outlandish and outrageous, but funny and yet fascinating, at least for me, at the wonder of human history.  I won't reveal what happens, in particular the nature of the scam, except to say it doesn't end well by over-step.Warmly recommended.  THere is no other film like this.

The ironic and satisfying ending is most likely modeled on the return of the head of explorer Adolph Schlagintweit to colonial administrators.Huston's original intent was to star Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart but it was not to be.  Christopher Plummer is sublime as a book-ended Rudyard Kipling and it's impossible to imagine anyone better than Sean Connery and Michael Caine as Danny Dravot and Peachy Carnehan who find that their ancient order of Masons offers unexpected temptations of greed, power, lust, deception and vaulting ambition.

The producers have done it justice by using the real life friends, Sean Connery and Michael Caine.  Their comradeship is whimsical, oafish and unbelievably real.If you haven't seen it, I hate to give it away...but...I will, a little.  Caine and Connery are British soldiers just 'retired' with intentions, almost literally, of conquering the world.  They ain't too bright.  They sign a covenant in front of Kipling, himself, to go north into Afghanistan, conquer a kingdom and rob it blind.  They also agree that there will be no women.Our boys, dressed as locals, push north through the Khyber pass.  They enter the brutal and desolate mountains of Afghanistan to face unbelievable hardships that would have destroyed lessor--make that more intelligent--men.  There are avalanches and snow blindness but remarkably, they make it to a land never exposed to white men, there culture and their weapons.  They rapidly subjugate the naive locals but are almost done under by religious monks who suspect they aren't quite as godlike as they claim.  Almost miraculously, however, they see a Masonic emblem around Connery's neck and take him to be the supernatural descendant of Alexander the Great, who passed that way 2,500 years earlier and left a Masonic symbol.Well, our boys are 'in like flint' and the gold of the Orient is poured on their heads...but...there is the issue of women, isn't there?Ron Braithwaite author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",5,Connery and Caine as Buddies--It really works,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,1592,"['Man', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'King', 'wonderful', 'adaptation', 'Kipling', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'producers', 'have', 'done', 'justice', 'using', 'real', 'life', 'friends', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'comradeship', 'whimsical', 'oafish', 'unbelievably', 'real.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'hate', 'give', 'away', 'will', 'little', 'Caine', 'Connery', 'are', 'British', 'soldiers', 'just', ""'retired"", 'intentions', 'almost', 'literally', 'conquering', 'world', 'ai', ""n't"", 'too', 'bright', 'sign', 'covenant', 'front', 'Kipling', 'go', 'north', 'Afghanistan', 'kingdom', 'rob', 'blind', 'also', 'agree', 'will', 'be', 'women.Our', 'boys', 'dressed', 'locals', 'push', 'north', 'Khyber', 'pass', 'enter', 'brutal', 'desolate', 'mountains', 'Afghanistan', 'face', 'unbelievable', 'hardships', 'would', 'have', 'destroyed', 'lessor', 'make', 'more', 'intelligent', 'men', 'are', 'avalanches', 'snow', 'blindness', 'remarkably', 'make', 'land', 'never', 'exposed', 'white', 'men', 'culture', 'weapons', 'rapidly', 'subjugate', 'naive', 'locals', 'are', 'almost', 'done', 'religious', 'monks', 'who', 'suspect', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'godlike', 'claim', 'Almost', 'miraculously', 'however', 'see', 'Masonic', 'emblem', 'Connery', 'neck', 'take', 'be', 'supernatural', 'descendant', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'who', 'passed', 'way', '2,500', 'years', 'earlier', 'left', 'Masonic', 'symbol.Well', 'boys', 'are', ""'in"", 'flint', 'gold', 'Orient', 'poured', 'heads', 'issue', 'women', ""n't"", 'there', 'Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Skull', 'Rack', 'Hummingbird', 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS

""Pop Culture Addict""","[18, 20]","John Huston's The Man Who Would Be King is a film that both celebrates the adventuresome spirit of the nineteenth-century and illustrates everything that was wrong with British colonialism. The film is based upon the famous Rudyard Kipling tale and follows the exploits of Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) and Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery). The two men hatch a plan where they will travel to Kafiristan and employ their wits and battle knowledge to become kings of Kafiristan. Skirmish after skirmish ensues and after one particular battle, Dravot survives being shot by an arrow and is presumed to be a god. Peachy and Dravot exploit this misunderstanding to the fullest and use their new stature to plunder the riches of Kafiristan. However, Dravot soon falls victim to his own human frailties and both he and Peachy are exposed as the frauds that they are. The rise and fall of Peachy and Dravot mirrors in microcosm the actual rise and fall of the British Colonial Empire itself. The subjugation of the natives leads to a brutal reckoning once the con men's motives are revealed to be less than noble just like the brutal reckoning the Empire experienced when the rest of the world adopted a more enlightened stance toward colonies the world over. In this sense, The Man Who Would Be King functions as a cautionary tale on the dual evils of racism and exploitation. Don't get the sense that this film is a heavy-handed ""message"" film though. Much credit must be given to Huston for managing to keep this film an adventuresome piece of mainstream entertainment despite its darker elements. Caine and Connery give great star turns as the dishonest schemers and we're overjoyed to be accompanying them on their treacherous journey into Kafiristan. When the film is over, we're depressed that their endless enthusiasm couldn't have been directed to more noble pursuits, but we're still glad we took the journey with them.",4,"""It was detriments like us that built this bloody Empire!""",1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,1919,"['John', 'Huston', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'film', 'adventuresome', 'spirit', 'nineteenth-century', 'everything', 'was', 'wrong', 'British', 'colonialism', 'film', 'based', 'famous', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'tale', 'exploits', 'Peachy', 'Carnehan', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Daniel', 'Dravot', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'two', 'men', 'hatch', 'plan', 'where', 'will', 'travel', 'Kafiristan', 'employ', 'wits', 'battle', 'knowledge', 'become', 'kings', 'Kafiristan', 'Skirmish', 'skirmish', 'ensues', 'one', 'particular', 'battle', 'Dravot', 'being', 'shot', 'arrow', 'presumed', 'be', 'god', 'Peachy', 'Dravot', 'exploit', 'misunderstanding', 'fullest', 'use', 'new', 'stature', 'plunder', 'riches', 'Kafiristan', 'However', 'Dravot', 'soon', 'victim', 'own', 'human', 'frailties', 'Peachy', 'are', 'exposed', 'frauds', 'are', 'rise', 'fall', 'Peachy', 'Dravot', 'mirrors', 'microcosm', 'actual', 'rise', 'fall', 'British', 'Colonial', 'Empire', 'subjugation', 'natives', 'brutal', 'reckoning', 'once', 'con', 'men', 'motives', 'are', 'revealed', 'be', 'less', 'noble', 'just', 'brutal', 'reckoning', 'Empire', 'experienced', 'when', 'rest', 'world', 'adopted', 'more', 'enlightened', 'stance', 'colonies', 'world', 'sense', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'functions', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'dual', 'evils', 'racism', 'exploitation', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'film', 'heavy-handed', 'message', 'film', 'Much', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Huston', 'managing', 'keep', 'film', 'adventuresome', 'piece', 'mainstream', 'entertainment', 'darker', 'elements', 'Caine', 'Connery', 'give', 'great', 'star', 'dishonest', 'schemers', ""'re"", 'overjoyed', 'be', 'accompanying', 'treacherous', 'journey', 'Kafiristan', 'When', 'film', ""'re"", 'depressed', 'endless', 'enthusiasm', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'more', 'noble', 'pursuits', ""'re"", 'still', 'glad', 'took', 'journey']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS

Best line in the film when asked if they were gods: ""No, we're Englishman, which is the next best thing.""The subsequent 1980's ""buddy"" films can look back on the swashbuckler for their origins.FIVE stars- top shelf entertainment, and the saddest ending since ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service.""",5,Connery and Caine Classic,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,1362,"['Talk', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'big', 'budget', 'top', 'adventure', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'features', 'Bond', 'veterans', 'Connery', 'Master', 'Horse', 'Bob', 'Simmons', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Michael', 'Caine.Add', 'Shakira', 'Michael', 'stunning', 'wife', '100+year', 'old', 'priest', 'Afghan', 'actor', 'who', 'scene', 'likable', 'Indian', 'actor', 'who', 'sacrificial', 'lamb', 'epic', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'aspect', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Caine', 'Connery', 'several', 'interviews', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'stated', 'Daniel', 'Dravot', 'was', 'favourite', 'character', 'play', 'Why', 'not-', 'genuinely', 'felt', 'was', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'making', 'film', 'Contrast', 'Only', 'Live', 'Twice', 'performance', 'mid', ""'70"", 'was', 'good', 'time', 'Connery-', 'had', 'lost', 'weight', 'moved', 'Spain', 'finally', 'was', 'string', 'very', 'good', 'films', 'including', 'Robin', 'Marian', 'A', 'Bridge', 'Too', 'Far', 'Wind', 'Lion', 'Makes', 'forget', 'Zardoz', 'Offense', 'Molly', 'McGuires', 'etc.Caine', 'usual', 'affable', 'just', 'superb', 'Best', 'line', 'film', 'when', 'asked', 'were', 'gods', 'No', ""'re"", 'Englishman', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'subsequent', '1980', 'buddy', 'films', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'swashbuckler', 'origins.FIVE', 'stars-', 'top', 'shelf', 'entertainment', 'saddest', 'ending', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS
423651,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6304457359,T O'Brien,"[6, 7]","The Man Who Would Be King is a throwback to the adventures films of the 1930's with great performances by Sean Connery and Michael Caine.  After a blackmail plan goes awry, ex-British soldiers Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan don't know what to do with themselves.  The duo decides to march across Iraq and  Afghanistan to the far-off and primitive nation of Kafiristan.  Once there, they plan to rob the place blind as they teach the Kafirians how to defeat their enemies with modern rifles.  However, in battle Dravot is wounded(an arrow is imbedded in his bandoleer) but not hurt making the Kafirians think that he is a god.  This movie has it all.  If you're a fan of good old-fashioned adventure movies, this is a safe bet.  You won't be disappointed.Sean Connery and Michael Caine are perfectly cast as Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, the two ex-British soldiers who hatch a plan to become the kings of the far-off country of Kafiristan.  By the end of the movie, you come to like the duo more than you ever thought you could.  Just like Paul Newman and Robert Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Connery and Caine have a real chemistry on screen that holds the movie together.  Christopher Plummer is also very good in a supporting role as Rudyard Kipling, the famous author who meets Danny and Peachy in his travels.  Saeed Jaffrey plays Billy Fish, an ex-Gurhka who serves as Danny and Peachy's translator.  The movie also stars Doghmi Larbi, Karroom Ben Bouih, and Michael Caine's wife Shakira as Roxanne, the Kafirian woman Danny takes as a wife.  The DVD offers a beautiful widescreen presentation, ""Call it Magic"" a brief 12 minute documentary about the making of the movie, and eight trailers from different John Huston movies, including The Man Who Would Be King.  The only bad part of the DVD is the dual-format(you have to turn the disc over halfway through the movie) but that is a minimal problem with a movie of this caliber.This is really one of those movies where everything comes together perfectly.  Great performances by Connery and Caine, brilliant directing by John Huston, beautifuly cinematography, and a great story full of action and humor.

Why this is, who knows. I think the two actors play superb roles and, as has been said before, the chemistry between them is startlingly obvious.Carnahan and Dravot are ex-British soldiers in 19th century India during the time of the Raj. Deciding that fame and fortune is to found in nearby Kafiristan, they set out to conquor the country. This they do by a quirk of fate when Danny is falsely claimed as a god and son of Alexander the Great.Things are fine until Danny takes a wife (played by Caine's real-life wife, Shakira). She bites him, he bleeds blood- indicating he is an ordinary mortal. Then things really go belly-up. Danny is sent plunging to the bottom of a very deep gorge and Peachy is crucified.Fine acting by Caine, Connery and Plummer. A special mention must go to Saaed Jaffrey who plays the part of Billy Fish, the loyal ex-Ghurka.Huston took his time to make this but, in the end, it was surely worth it.",5,Spot on!,1066780800,"10 22, 2003",2003,1181,"['Just', 'sort', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'wet', 'sunday', 'afternoon', 'when', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'watch', 'television.Strangely', 'early', 'reviews', 'movie', 'criticise', 'casting', 'insisting', 'Connery', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'Carnahan', 'Caine', 'Dravot', 'Why', 'who', 'think', 'two', 'actors', 'play', 'superb', 'roles', 'been', 'said', 'chemistry', 'startlingly', 'obvious.Carnahan', 'Dravot', 'are', 'ex-British', 'soldiers', '19th', 'century', 'India', 'time', 'Raj', 'Deciding', 'fame', 'fortune', 'found', 'nearby', 'Kafiristan', 'set', 'out', 'conquor', 'country', 'do', 'quirk', 'fate', 'when', 'Danny', 'falsely', 'claimed', 'god', 'son', 'Alexander', 'Great.Things', 'are', 'fine', 'Danny', 'wife', 'played', 'Caine', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Shakira', 'blood-', 'indicating', 'ordinary', 'mortal', 'Then', 'things', 'really', 'go', 'belly-up', 'Danny', 'sent', 'plunging', 'bottom', 'very', 'deep', 'gorge', 'Peachy', 'crucified.Fine', 'acting', 'Caine', 'Connery', 'Plummer', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'go', 'Saaed', 'Jaffrey', 'who', 'part', 'Billy', 'Fish', 'loyal', 'ex-Ghurka.Huston', 'took', 'time', 'make', 'end', 'was', 'surely', 'worth']",The Man Who Would Be King VHS
423653,A96JD9312DHWC,6304457359,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[1, 1]","Hoping for riches beyond belief, two British officers set off into the blank spots on the map with only a few crates of guns and the willpower to become more. They have a plan, too, and it involves creating a powerbase that will make them rich beyond their meager means. When they find themselves surrounded by gold and thought to be the rightful heirs of alexander the Great's riches, however, the two find themselves caught in a golden web that promises to either make them god-men or make them deadmen. All because of the masonic symbol, a nice little arrow, and the color of their skin.While many movies boast of having a powerful cast and a great script, this movie really does have both. It begins with two powerful actors that want to be more than common soldiers, and so they tempt fate and cross over some horrific terrain. When they get to wherever they are going, they show the people rifles, begin setting up camp, and find themsleves getting more material gains. Then they hear of a temple on top of a sacred mountain and decide that they should go there and see what they can get from the seemingly peaceful people that stand guard over a mountain of gold and gems. The real power is not in the gold and jewels, however, but is instead hinged around the the acting prowess of our two main characters. One begins to believe himself a god and the other begins to wonder why they don't take the loot and split. Add to that woman problems - or obsession and the want to have it all - and you have yourself a tale that has stuck with me since i was a little kid. It has left my side as Christmas presents, as birthday gifts, and as other forms of tribute to get people to never forget it, either. and that is because it is a classic, and the story it tells rivals many of the things that people hold in the highest regard.If you have never heard of the movie, you need to drop everything and order it now. you will feel reward right away, and you will thank yourself for listing to the cash that wanted you to spend it. If you have heard of it but have not seen it in a long time, watch it again and see it in a different light. Every few years I notice something different here, something I thought I had a grasp on, and that is enough to convince me to say that is worthy of keeping around forever. An army of people agree with this accessment, too, with the movie finding itself voted into the Top 20 movies of all time by lists like TMC, many guidebooks, people that really do not matter, and so on. The one person that does matter is you, though, and seeing this will make you rememeber what it was like to watch a movie that was bigger than life and that made you wonder if the characters could hold the cards in check or if they would see their kingdom come crashing to dust.I cannot profess enough elation at having been given this movie when I was younger.
