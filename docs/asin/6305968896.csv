These pictures often boast well-developed characters, evolving situations that reveal complex motives, thereby building drama, and carefully hewn dialogue.  The Big Kahuna, sadly, is a horse of another color - like Glengarry Glen Ross without the edge, energy, and exquisite contrapuntal timing.Roger Rueff wrote the play, and the screenplay, Danny DeVito and Kevin Spacey star, Spacey also gets credit for production.  Peter Facinelli rounds out this threesome of industrial lubricant reps holed up in yet another gruesome hospitality suite, desperately hoping to score.  DeVito and Spacey are both terrific actors, and they make wonderful foils for each other, so, on paper it looks promising.The Spacey character is most central; consequently, his flaws draw the movie down most obviously.  Spacey is simply too cynical, bitter, and hollow to be interesting; he's toxic.  DeVito, by contrast, is living in a gentle state of benign despair, toying with suicide the way a child might tease a scab.  The Facinelli character is truly cardboard, a symbol - young, idealistic, and a born-again Christian who radiates mindless idealism.For Rueff, this is a concept play, with a didactic agenda.  By showing two worlds colliding, crass commercialism and intense religious faith, he wants us to notice how similar they are - indeed, he'd like us to conclude that there is only the thickness of a blonde hair separating a man who passionately sells industrial lubricant on the floor of a convention center from a man who passionately sells redemption while wearing a dress and standing in a pulpit.  The concept in itself is interesting, but Rueff ""tells,"" and tells and tells, he doesn't ""show"" through his characters.  It is this interminable leading by the nose that causes the film to fail.DeVito almost makes the sale at the film's end with a really beautiful speech, but by then it is too late.  Also - perhaps one off color industrial lubricant joke too many.

Kevin Spacey delivers a great and genuine performance as well as DeVito. The fantasy/imagination scenes are some of the most comical seen in any movie for quite some time. My favorite quote or dialogue from any scene is between Spacey and Facinelli about seeing what the young business man can bring to the table, &quot;You'll never know unless you throw me in the water and see if I can swim.&quot; Spacey's character replies,&quot;You're missing the point. We're going to throw you off the cliff and see if you can fly!...&quot;Also, Devito's monologue speech about his dream or nightmare he had as  a child of God hiding in the closet is classic.The added plus is that this movie does not drag to 2-2 1/2 hours.It's 90 minutes with a clear message;Be human and make the most of your life---not very profound, but still a great message !

But I think at a more fine level, in these enormous buildings are a personage I think very own of the USA, and he's the salesman, the businessmen, the manager or as you like to say, the man who has to sell the enormous amount of products that are made. These work seems to me as hard as these of the cowboy and there's  ""Death a salesman"" by Arthur Miller, a play made forever, unthinkable outside the USA but universal, so surely the American salesman is the best. He sustains the whole world of commerce, it's only that these people uses not to taste. In Europe these work reminds the painful figure of the prosecuted Jew. Sales seems to be not a heroic work and they are worrying people. Well, in this movie, there are three salesmen, one has yet seen almost all and he's tired and prone to drink, another is a young one, inexperienced and narrow minded. Kevin Spacey, the third, is a fully experienced salesman. They sell industrial lubricants but, who are interested in these? Nobody, and the three men in the Hotel Suite less than anyone in the world excepting perhaps the young one because he hasn't still understood in that consists his work. Sales require decision, so, you sometimes have to go to a striptease club and make love with the dancer at sight of all people. No wonder this a weary work! The young one are scandalized, but after a tense conversation the three men have learned each one at less a thing or two from the others because behind their profession are people who achieves a difficult, hazardous, ultracompetitive work that requires knowledge of all facets of life, not in deep but yes in a very wide area including the selection of the correct hotel and convenient appetizers.

485452,A3IX26GXO7NNTI,6305968896,commontone,"[52, 52]","This movie is essentially a filmed play.  I won't waste time discussing the plot, which is already well-covered by other reviews.  DeVito and Spacey turn out great performances, as can be expected.  Spacey dons his usual sharp tongue to play Larry, while DeVito steps out of his typical obnoxious wiseguy skin to play Phil, a quiet man unsure about his life and spirituality.  The surprise here is Peter Facinelli, a young Tom Cruise look-alike (humorously alluded to in a scene where his character imagines himself tending bar, a la &quot;Cocktail&quot;) who holds his own against the two venerable veterans.  He plays a young, idealistic and deeply pious newcomer to the business scene, Bob.  Other critics have described him as arrogant, but he's not--his religious convictions simply run so deeply he honestly can't understand those who disagree with him.  The abrasive and vulgar Larry provides Bob with a sort of guilty fascination; Larry is clearly brilliant, but is just as clearly not a church-goer.  The film finds a believable and gripping tone with which to question faith and spirituality, and concludes that all three men are spiritual in their own way: Larry finds meaning through his job, Bob through Christ, and Phil lies somewhere inbetween, tired of the charade of his career but unsure how to continue.  DeVito has the two most powerful scenes.  In the first, he bares his heart to Larry, reminiscing about a poignant, haunting childhood dream.  In the second, he lectures Bob, reminding him that he hasn't lived enough to be so sure of himself.  You don't have to be religious or deeply spiritual to enjoy this film, only thoughtful.  &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; is a succinct, quiet, and surprisingly affecting film.",4,Quiet brilliance,1007164800,"12 1, 2001",2001,1737,"['movie', 'essentially', 'filmed', 'play', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'discussing', 'plot', 'already', 'well-covered', 'other', 'reviews', 'DeVito', 'Spacey', 'turn', 'out', 'great', 'performances', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'Spacey', 'usual', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'play', 'Larry', 'DeVito', 'typical', 'obnoxious', 'wiseguy', 'skin', 'play', 'Phil', 'quiet', 'man', 'unsure', 'life', 'spirituality', 'surprise', 'here', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'young', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'look-alike', 'humorously', 'alluded', 'scene', 'where', 'character', 'imagines', 'tending', 'bar', 'la', 'quot', 'Cocktail', 'quot', 'who', 'own', 'two', 'venerable', 'veterans', 'young', 'idealistic', 'deeply', 'pious', 'newcomer', 'business', 'scene', 'Bob', 'Other', 'critics', 'have', 'described', 'arrogant', 'not', 'religious', 'convictions', 'simply', 'run', 'so', 'deeply', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'who', 'disagree', 'abrasive', 'vulgar', 'Larry', 'Bob', 'sort', 'guilty', 'fascination', 'Larry', 'clearly', 'brilliant', 'just', 'as', 'clearly', 'not', 'church-goer', 'film', 'believable', 'gripping', 'tone', 'question', 'faith', 'spirituality', 'three', 'men', 'are', 'spiritual', 'own', 'way', 'Larry', 'meaning', 'job', 'Bob', 'Christ', 'Phil', 'somewhere', 'inbetween', 'tired', 'charade', 'career', 'unsure', 'how', 'continue', 'DeVito', 'two', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'first', 'heart', 'Larry', 'reminiscing', 'poignant', 'haunting', 'childhood', 'dream', 'second', 'Bob', 'reminding', ""n't"", 'lived', 'enough', 'be', 'so', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'religious', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'enjoy', 'film', 'only', 'thoughtful', 'quot', 'Big', 'Kahuna', 'quot', 'succinct', 'quiet', 'surprisingly', 'affecting', 'film']",The Big Kahuna VHS
485453,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,6305968896,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[0, 0]","&quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; has not generated anywhere near the  audience it deserves.  Originally a play by Roger Rueff who also wrote the screenplay, the movie regrettably has a rushed quality about it that is most likely due to the fact that Kevin Spacey could only devote a relatively short period of time to the project. Nevertheless, the talents of both Spacey and Danny DeVito more than make up for this defect. Also, the acting ability of the virtually unknown, Peter Fucinello, should be held in high regard.  Fucinello aptly performed the role of the awkward, immature, and existentially challenged young sales representative, Bob.  I might also add that Fucinello's portrayal of an ill at ease young man may not have been much of a stretch.  Fucinello in real life probably felt intimidated performing along aside two of the greatest actors of our era.  The story line has these three gentlemen attending a business conference in Wichita, Kansas, for the sole purpose of obtaining a meeting with the sales prospect, Mr. Fuller, &quot;The Big Kahuna,&quot; to propose the qualities of their firm's manufacturing lubricant.I sensed a pervasively anti-Capitalist theme throughout the pursuit of &quot;The Big Kahuna.&quot;  Was it merely my imagination, or did Roger  Rueff desire to portray the younger Bob as more virtuous and idealistic than either Larry (Spacey) or Phil (DeVito)?  The latter are supposedly hard bitten, somewhat cynical, and overly devoted to closing the big sales to the point of ignoring the larger concerns of life.  Yet, I perceived both Larry and Phil as essentially decent men who took good care of their customers. I also know from first hand experience that neither a sales person or their company survives in the long run if the customer's requirements are not met. The younger Bob was actually the unethical one who had no problem cashing his employer's paycheck while focussing primarily upon the mysteries of the universe.  Bob should be doing such navel gazing on his own time. Was the audience suppose to conclude that manufacturing lubricants are not of real value to the world?  How would one feel, for  instance, if a surgeon opted to discussing religion or philosophy instead of operating on his seriously injured patient?  &quot;The Big Kahuna's&quot; company may have  desperately needed this lubricant.  Both Mr. Fuller and Bob were outrageously selfish in placing a higher priority on discussing the ultimate mysteries of life over their immediate  responsibilities to their respective business organizations.  I would be furious, if I worked for Mr. Fuller, at the flagrant disregard of his obligations  towards the company.The reader should not mistake my reservations concerning the message Roger Rueff perhaps wanted to convey as a belittlement of the movie. I truly admire Rueff's work.  Furthermore, It is not at all unusual for members of the audience to interpret the story differently than  the author may have intended.  &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; is a must see movie for all those earning a living.

485454,A3DNFPPM30AP96,6305968896,"""def_""","[1, 1]","I was browsing through cable late one night and stumbled across the familiar faces of Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, Se7en) and Danny Devito (Batman Returns, Death To Smoochy), I gave it a watch and was completely taken in by the film. However, I only caught the tail end of it. After that night I never saw the film again. Luckily enough I was browsing through the previously viewed DVD section at my local video store and found a copy of The Big Kahuna. I picked it up for a steal.The dialogue in this film is some of my favorite, it rivals that of Tarantino's films with the massive conveyence of information but making it all seem rather nonchalant. Kevin Spacey is hilarious in this movie. It's stunning what a serious movie this is but still manages to be so funny at the same time. Danny Devito gives one of the greatest acting performances I have ever seen. I still don't think I have seen better, and I doubt I probably ever will.This film is a very interesting one, there's basicly only three people in the entire film.

485458,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305968896,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 2]","This refreshingly intelligent film delivers raw intellectual power by retaining the look and feel of the play from which it was adapted.  The use of a single set and just three actors throws the emphasis entirely upon the in-depth character studies, the incisive dialogue and the actors' outstanding performances.  It draws us into the lives of three seemingly ordinary guys at a convention whose interaction broaches questions that are nothing short of an examination of the meaning of life.  The dialogue unabashedly strips the characters naked to show the ironies and hypocrisies inherent in their strategies for establishing meaning in the machinations of mundane lives.  The laser sharp exchanges slash relentlessly at the souls of each, leaving none of the characters intact by the end of the film.  And with each thrust, they drive another introspective probe deep into the psyche of the viewer.The presentation reminded me a little of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" with its theatrical feel and deep reflective tone, although this film was more confronting and less darkly despondent.  Roger Roeff's penetrating script approaches the meaninglessness of life from three unique perspectives.  We have Larry (Kevin Spacey) the seemingly superficial cynic who has far greater depth than he lets on and who uses his sardonic persona as a defense mechanism to hide his own fears.  Phil (Danny DeVito) is the pragmatic but jaded salesman who is great at putting things in perspective for everyone but himself.  Bob is the nave young Christian zealot whose antidote for the futility of life is a strong dose of Jesus.The juxtaposition of Larry the cynic and Bob the idealist makes for numerous thought provoking exchanges, especially when we learn that Phil (our mediator and voice of reason) is drowning in his own soul-searching quest for meaning.  The story poses more questions than it does answers, and sputters a bit at the end, but overall it accomplishes its purpose of making the viewer ponder profundities easily ignored while in the pursuit of everyday priorities.The acting was brilliant.  Kevin Spacey gave what I thought was the best performance of his career.  This was so much more interesting and meaty a character than he played in ""American Beauty"" that Spacey easily eclipsed even that outstanding performance.  Larry was such a dynamic and complex character, that Spacey was able to open up the throttle and show us the full measure of his considerable talents.  Likewise, Danny DeVito delivered a personal best in a serious dramatic role.  His portrayal of the mediator who was trying to keep the peace while he was disintegrating inside was subtle and powerful.  Peter Facinelli was also near perfect with an utterly believable and sincere performance as the pure hearted whelp whose heart was suffused with the Lord.I rated this film a 9/10, but it requires a certain type of viewer to enjoy it.  It is a very intellectual film, which precludes it from having much mass appeal.  Action junkies will be bored to tears.

Set almost entirely in a hospitality suite at an industrial lubricants convention, 'Kahuna' feels unintentionally claustrophobic and the stilted dialogue that comes out of every character's mouth doesn't help things either. The film wavers between dull and cliche and no amount of overacting from a tedious Spacey is going to save us.When the examination of the human condition through the lens of ""sales"" has already been done before (and better) in works like 'Death of a Salesman' and 'Glengarry, Glen Ross', what does 'Kahuna' offer us? Lots of talking and talking. Two or three people in a room, one having a deeply personal crisis, another a deeply religious one and all three of them revealing themselves in a stream-of-consciousness yielding such lines as, ""Don't you quote scripture to me, Bob!"" and ""Larry, do you love me?"" Spacey spends the first hour of the film overacting with the same kind of callousness he brings to Larry's character that he brought to 'Swimming with Sharks'. Then, suddenly, as the long night drags on, Larry softens up a bit extending himself emotionally to a recently divorced Phil (DeVito). DeVito spends a lot of time saying, ""We'll be all right,"" and staring pensively off into space or letting his eyes get all dewy with emotion (about what? His divorce? His desire to get out of the sales business? Who cares?)Then we have Bob, the clean-cut devout Christian who cannot seem to talk to anyone without bringing God into the conversation. All fine and good, but it becomes clear very quickly that Bob has chosen the wrong profession when he speaks to the elusive Kahuna of the title on two separate occaisions and bends the guy's ear about Jesus both times when he's really there to land a lubricant contract. ""But I think that's important!"" Bob shouts at Larry. I kept thinking, 'Um, yeah sure it is. Follow your heart. Go be an evangelist. Knock yourself out kid. Just get out of this movie because I don't see the point of your being here.' Plus, I know enough devout Christians who are capable of separating their work and their God. Bob, on the other hand, strikes me as a useless simpleton.

To this reviewers mind, that is one of the things - outside of excellent acting and good dialogue - that makes The Big Kahuna a spectacular work of art.Translated from Roger Rueff's play, ""Hospitality Suite,"" TBK lets us into the world of three salesmen of industrial lubricants before, during, and after, hosting a business party that could make or break their careers. One character is a veteran who is growing weary of the business world. Another is a middle aged 'natural born salesman.' The third is a rookie who is new to the whole thing and is (some would say) naive about the whole business process. Between these three divurgent personalities, sparks fly, waters are tested, and no one is left unscathed.As said, sometimes art is made great by its abilty to show the 'beneath the surface' side of seemingly ordinary things. In TBK, a business party becomes the vehicle for exploring everything from how much 'humanness' is permitted into the impersonal world of business, what happens when religious ethics show up in the business world, and (?!) even matters of life, death, and whether either has any grande meaning.Especially, religion is a large element of the film. The youngest character - the newbie - is a religiously committed baptist. The oldest character, by contrast, seems to be going through a crisis of faith and is ""wondering about god"" in increasing amounts. When an important big-whig doesn't show up to the party, one character urges another to ""have faith... for once in your life."" And the words ""Jesus Christ"" are bandied about as everything from a proper name to a nasty exclamation. If nothing else, the invocation of religion into a film about ""making the sale"" makes for a thrilling tension underlying the entire film.Others have commented on the acting. All three characters - Peter Facinelli (the newbie), Kevin Spacey (natural-born-salesman) and Danny DeVito (the tired veteran) - all give outstanding performances. All three know their characters very well, making for very reallistic interplay. Despite my efforts, I cannot imagine these roles being played better by any other actors.If you like films that make you think a bit, taking ordinary things and showing them from angles that make them appear new, then this film is one you should check out.

485475,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6305968896,Mr. Cairene,"[5, 6]","If there is one realization you take from this acute gem, then it would be this: In this world, there are those who preach, and those who listen. What The Big Kahuna amusingly, movingly and effectively argues is that a ""preacher"" need not be selling a religion. An ideology will do. Industrial lubricants will do. So how much buying and selling do you really do? Have you ever tried to convince someone of your worldview? Have you ever accepted and then adopted a point of view that was not your own? So how much buying and selling do you really do?As a veteran film fan, I can assert that Wichita, Kansas is an acronym for ""nowhere"". In this nondescript environment enter three archetypes, the cynical Larry (Kevin Spacey), the religious and bible quoting rookie Bob (Peter Facinelli) and most importantly the reflective Phil (Danny De Vito). He is depressed, confused, less hungry for the deal and unlike Larry and Bob, he has nothing to sell. The Spacey character's most primal objective is to find the ""Grand Kahuna"", the big wallet who's going to make this trip worthwhile. For Spacey, who could not be uninteresting if you had a gun to his head, this performance is a particular standout. Not only is Larry more relaxed and human then most of the diabolical intellectuals he usually plays, but this time he laces his sardonic comments with a superficial ease that could only be attained when someone is making a pitch. As for Bob, his quotation of scripture,  and bland reflective demeanor are also a pitch. He wants to sell them on his idea of ""goodness"". For the time being Larry seems to be winning the battle of words with his slick one liners. But give the kid time, he will learn and he will sell.Crucial to the film's power is Phil. Lacking the pedagoguery that justifies the other two's existence, he is depressed. Even suicidal. An intelligent being can not live without a philosophy, religious or otherwise. He has lived long enough, or just lived enough to know that the philosophy he used to ascribe to, the philosophy Larry still ascribes to is flawed. He is intelligent enough to know that if he chooses Bob's way of life, then it too will reveal flaws. We all need something to believe in and keep in mind that atheism, rejection and pacifism are also beliefs. De Vito has this wonderful scene, the best acted scenes so far this year, where he recalls a dream he once had about God. I will not describe the scene here, but you will know it when you see it.Some will find the prospect of a film set mostly in one room unappealing. But if anything, The Big Kahuna proves that with superior writing, great performances you don't need the scenery. Indeed, in comparison most films seem hide behind their scenery, their special effects and their nudity to obscure their emptiness. To put it bluntly, the film not only has an unexpected emotional punch but is also entertaining as ""hell"".The film's most revealing scene contrasts religion and common sense. What is to ""love"" and what it is to just ""like"". Phil asks Larry ""Do you love me?"". Larry responds ""If you mean `would I die for you, would I jump out the window if you asked' then no. I don't."" Had Larry made their affection and friendship a religion, he probably would have jumped.

485482,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305968896,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","Though essentially little more than a stage bound version of the play, ""Hospitality Suite,"" the film entitled ""The Big Kahuna"" earns distinction for its sharply delineated characters and the finely wrought performances of its three main actors.  In fact, the stage origins of the film are evident in the fact that the action rarely extends beyond a single set - a hotel suite in Wichita, Kansas in which three salesman are gathered for a convention - and the fact that only four people are even assigned speaking parts (and even the fourth is a mere walk-on bellboy).  All the other people we see serve as a kind of silent backdrop before which the three principal players enact their complex personal drama.Kevin Spacey, in a truly brilliant performance, plays Larry, a middle-aged, sardonic salesman who sees life strictly from the perspective of a hardcore cynic and who, consequently, runs roughshod over his two business associates with his acerbic wit and hardnosed bluntness.  In total contrast is Bob (Peter Facinelli), a 20-something neophyte to the selling business, a sincere, well-intentioned, but hopelessly nave born-again Christian, who has trouble separating his career as a salesman from his felt need to fulfill the Biblical edict to go out among men and spread the Good News.  Caught between the two is Phil (Danny DeVito), a 52-year old man who, after years of devoting his life to the cause of selling, has begun to seriously question the validity of his life's work and has, therefore, recently found himself contemplating such weighty matters as suicide, the existence of God and the meaning of love and friendship.  Obviously, such cleanly delineated characters could well have slid over into two-dimensional stereotypes, yet the author, Roger Rueff, in adapting his play to the screen, has built into each of the three principal figures a dimension of multifaceted human complexity.  Larry, for instance, despite all of his facile cynicism, shows a far deeper side to his character when, in a quiet moment in which Phil pours his heart out to him, he offers his buddy the hand of genuine compassion and friendship.  We discover that the often-bitter tone Larry displays to the world is just a faade, a cover-up for the void that lies deep within his own troubled psyche.  Similarly, Rueff avoids the common trap of reducing the devout Christian character to the customary level of a mindless buffoon.  Although we sense that Bob too uses his Christianity as a way of ordering his life - thereby avoiding the messy ugliness that a more freethinking life often requires - yet, Rueff merely implies that Bob has some growing up to do, not that his belief system must itself be jettisoned.  And Phil, caught between these two worldviews, provides, out of his own confused weakness, the voice of reasoned sanity that helps Larry and Bob come to a final understanding and mutual appreciation of each other.  He sees Larry plainly for who he is, yet Phil knows that this is the person who means more to him than anyone else in the world.  Similarly, though he somewhat admires and respects Bob's sincere devotion to his Christian principles, Phil knows that Bob has a long way to go before he becomes a true ""man of character.""""The Big Kahuna"" does not provide big laughs, though the sardonic wit often strikes a deep chord in the audience.  The film may also seem claustrophobic to those who demand more movement from their movies.  The dialogue, however, is consistently sharp and incisive, even though Phil's final speech borders a bit on the pedantic.  (At this point, Phil's function as the author's mouthpiece becomes a bit heavy-handed to say the least).  Nevertheless, for those in search of a fine character study, driven by strong performances and insightful observations about human nature, ""The Big Kahuna"" is definitely worth checking out.",3,thoughtful drama,969494400,"09 21, 2000",2000,3870,"['Though', 'essentially', 'more', 'stage', 'bound', 'version', 'play', 'Hospitality', 'Suite', 'film', 'entitled', 'Big', 'Kahuna', 'distinction', 'sharply', 'delineated', 'characters', 'finely', 'wrought', 'performances', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'fact', 'stage', 'origins', 'film', 'are', 'evident', 'fact', 'action', 'rarely', 'single', 'set', 'hotel', 'suite', 'Wichita', 'Kansas', 'three', 'salesman', 'are', 'gathered', 'convention', 'fact', 'only', 'four', 'people', 'are', 'even', 'assigned', 'speaking', 'parts', 'even', 'fourth', 'mere', 'walk-on', 'bellboy', 'other', 'people', 'see', 'serve', 'kind', 'silent', 'backdrop', 'three', 'principal', 'players', 'enact', 'complex', 'personal', 'drama.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Larry', 'middle-aged', 'sardonic', 'salesman', 'who', 'life', 'strictly', 'perspective', 'hardcore', 'cynic', 'who', 'consequently', 'roughshod', 'two', 'business', 'associates', 'acerbic', 'wit', 'hardnosed', 'bluntness', 'total', 'contrast', 'Bob', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', '20-something', 'neophyte', 'selling', 'business', 'sincere', 'well-intentioned', 'hopelessly', 'nave', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'who', 'trouble', 'separating', 'career', 'salesman', 'felt', 'need', 'fulfill', 'Biblical', 'edict', 'go', 'out', 'men', 'spread', 'Good', 'News', 'Caught', 'two', 'Phil', 'Danny', 'DeVito', '52-year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'years', 'devoting', 'life', 'cause', 'selling', 'begun', 'seriously', 'question', 'validity', 'life', 'work', 'therefore', 'recently', 'found', 'contemplating', 'such', 'weighty', 'matters', 'suicide', 'existence', 'God', 'meaning', 'love', 'friendship', 'Obviously', 'such', 'cleanly', 'delineated', 'characters', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'slid', 'over', 'two-dimensional', 'stereotypes', 'yet', 'author', 'Roger', 'Rueff', 'adapting', 'play', 'screen', 'built', 'three', 'principal', 'figures', 'dimension', 'multifaceted', 'human', 'complexity', 'Larry', 'instance', 'facile', 'cynicism', 'far', 'deeper', 'side', 'character', 'when', 'quiet', 'moment', 'Phil', 'heart', 'buddy', 'hand', 'genuine', 'compassion', 'friendship', 'discover', 'often-bitter', 'tone', 'Larry', 'world', 'just', 'faade', 'cover-up', 'void', 'deep', 'own', 'troubled', 'psyche', 'Similarly', 'Rueff', 'common', 'trap', 'reducing', 'devout', 'Christian', 'character', 'customary', 'level', 'mindless', 'buffoon', 'sense', 'Bob', 'too', 'Christianity', 'way', 'ordering', 'life', 'thereby', 'avoiding', 'messy', 'ugliness', 'more', 'freethinking', 'life', 'often', 'yet', 'Rueff', 'merely', 'Bob', 'growing', 'up', 'do', 'not', 'belief', 'system', 'must', 'be', 'jettisoned', 'Phil', 'caught', 'two', 'worldviews', 'own', 'confused', 'weakness', 'voice', 'reasoned', 'sanity', 'Larry', 'Bob', 'come', 'final', 'understanding', 'mutual', 'appreciation', 'other', 'Larry', 'plainly', 'who', 'yet', 'Phil', 'person', 'who', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'world', 'Similarly', 'somewhat', 'Bob', 'sincere', 'devotion', 'Christian', 'principles', 'Phil', 'Bob', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'true', 'man', 'character', 'Big', 'Kahuna', 'not', 'provide', 'big', 'laughs', 'sardonic', 'wit', 'often', 'deep', 'chord', 'audience', 'film', 'may', 'also', 'seem', 'claustrophobic', 'who', 'demand', 'more', 'movement', 'movies', 'dialogue', 'however', 'consistently', 'sharp', 'incisive', 'even', 'Phil', 'final', 'speech', 'borders', 'bit', 'pedantic', 'point', 'Phil', 'function', 'author', 'mouthpiece', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'say', 'least', 'Nevertheless', 'search', 'fine', 'character', 'study', 'driven', 'strong', 'performances', 'insightful', 'observations', 'human', 'nature', 'Big', 'Kahuna', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",The Big Kahuna VHS

The film starts out like &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; with Kevin Spacey as Willie Loman teaching a young Biff-like protege the importance of ingratiatory salesmanship.  But then it takes off unexpectedly on a spiritual tangent (that seemed more like an agenda at first) before finishing up like &quot;The Rapture&quot; as a cautionary tale about the dangers of over-zealousness and the intransigence of one's belief system.  The similarities between the religion of Christ and the reverence for Mammon was already fascinating (and apparent) without Devito's superfluous summarizing monologue.  The claustrophobic setting reveals the film's origin as a stageplay but that didn't bother me because these three guys don't seem like the types who would want to grab a breath of fresh air in Wichita, KS anyway.
