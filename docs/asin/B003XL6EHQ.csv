1370632,A1TCV11CEB0EKD,B003XL6EHQ,Alan Mansfield,"[13, 20]","This season was hilarious, infact, the WHOLE series is... so please dont let my 2 star rating fool you. The show itself is 5+ stars!  It is simply about the quality of the dvd.  The 1st 3 seasons were all on 3 dvds or less per season, and the fourth did have four dvds as well.  BUT ALL FOUR of them were all much better quality than the 5th season.  Most of it is viewable, in fact it all is.  HOWEVER, there are several scenes within episodes (typically the first 2 and last 2 episodes of the dvd) are very, well, blotchy like... sort of like watching a poor quality youtube video online. But it is mainly when there is alot of movement with in the scene between the actors.  NO, IT IS NOT MY TV or DVD PLAYER.  NO, IT IS NOT THAT IM USE TO BLUE RAY.  Unless my box set is just a bad lemon, I do feel as if this set isn't top quality for regular dvd.And to the haters that are going to say this isn't a helpful review, bite me, k?  B/c it is helpful, at least informative if nothing else. You're just upset that I didn't rate the show higher.  Like I said, the show itself is wonderful, including this season.  I'm simply writing a review of the product's quality, not just the actual show.The truth is, I'm just glad that they are finally releasing the rest of the series.  It just seems to me that if fans were able to wait over 3 years for season 4 to be realeased (yea, season 3 was released in 2007 & season 4 was in 2010) then I say we can wait an extra couple of weeks for them to properly inspect the quality of their product.

Nuanced performances.Fourth, actually filmed in NY, unlike that 'other' series - you know the one.Fifth, a whole series story arc.

Most of the shows are very funny, some hilarious, some will touch your heart. The last two seasons of Mad About You have not been released yet. I'd say its about time. If this was a favorite show then I suggest you add it to your DVD collection. The character of  Ira Buchman is played by John Pankow, who is the younger brother of James  Pankow, trombonist with the popular rock group Chicago. Some of the funniest scenes are between Ira and Paul. Leila Kenzle plays Fran, Jamie's friend. Richard Kind plays Fran's husband and he has som hilarious scenes. Many of my favorite shows center around their dog Murray. There is one Thanksgiving episode called Giblets for Murray that is superb. The string of guests that appear is also great. Billy Joel, Sid Caesar, Mel Brooks, Lyle Lovett. Look the series up on th imdb and you can see all the shows and guests. Please release seasons six and seven !!!!!!!!!!One word about the quality. The first season comes in a plastic box with all 24 episodes on 2 discs. The quality is not that great. I believe the rest of the season 2-5 are all on 4 disc packages. There is a cardboard sleeve over the disc box which is very difficult to get off. My season 2 ripped. Season 1 needs to be redone for better quality. Such classic shows on season 1 such as when Paul and Jamie first met.Trivia question. Where have you seen Jamie's obstetrician  ? Hint ...
