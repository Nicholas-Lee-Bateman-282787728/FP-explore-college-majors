It isn't going to win any academy awards nor did it bring anything new to the genre but it was enjoyable and held my interest.  A singer has an affair and things start going wrong for her.  It reminds me of Fatal Attraction meets Fear.  I thought the acting and pacing was nice.  You get a chance to get to know Hayle and see how she struggles with the death of her brother, her insecurities and how it reflects in her music.  I also enjoyed the music featured in the film. That being said I was a bit disappointed that the movie dropped the suit/tie wearing fan stalker aspect.  It would have been nice to have him be tied into her tormenter much like the other deaths that surround her.  I don't want to say too much and ruin the movie but it is worth a watch.",4,Stylish Fatal Attraction with Good Music,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,784,"['enjoyed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'academy', 'awards', 'did', 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'genre', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'held', 'interest', 'A', 'singer', 'affair', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'wrong', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'meets', 'Fear', 'thought', 'acting', 'pacing', 'was', 'nice', 'get', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'Hayle', 'see', 'how', 'death', 'brother', 'insecurities', 'how', 'music', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'featured', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'dropped', 'suit/tie', 'wearing', 'fan', 'stalker', 'aspect', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'be', 'tied', 'tormenter', 'much', 'other', 'deaths', 'surround', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'watch']",Plush
1667294,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00EI3YG0K,C. Sawin,"[5, 7]","The big selling point of ""Plush"" is that it's from the director of ""Twilight."" While that is true, Catherine Hardwicke also directed ""Lords of Dogtown"" and ""Red Riding Hood,"" so you probably know what you're in for just by looking at the Texas born director's previous works. Both Cam Gigandet and Xavier Samuel found themselves in ""Twilight"" sequels while Emily Browning has mostly bounced around horror films (""Ghost Ship,"" ""Darkness Falls,"" ""The Uninvited"") and whatever you consider ""Sucker Punch"" to be. Assuming that ""Plush"" is an overloaded drama packed to the brim with sex and romance is a pretty fair assessment.But the issue is that the writing of the film is very uneven and sloppy. The opening itself is unlike anything that occurs for the next hour. In an underground mine of some kind, a mysterious person is playing with the mining equipment; pulling on pulleys and wheeling around carts full of rocks. A girl tied up in a chair is revealed as a load of rocks is dumped on her and she dies under the rockslide. The killer approaches the pile, digs out the woman's hand, and takes the restraint off her wrist. After turning her hand palm up, you see the title of the film on the veins in her wrist before really obnoxious music begins to play and the opening credits begin. The film mostly plays out like any other romantic drama; a happily married woman somehow finds comfort in a tragic event in the bad boy closest to her and provides something that her husband cannot. But it somehow completely switches gears in the last 20 minutes and tries to be this heart racing thriller that is borderline horror at times.The music of the film is just noise, loud sounds, and most lyrics replaced with screaming or moans and groans. It tries to be industrial, but every song sounds exactly the same. The three main characters of the film are perhaps the worst culprits of terrible writing. Hayley doesn't seem to understand why her life goes in the direction it goes in by the time everything hits the fan. She makes poor decision after poor decision and then wonders why things can't just go back to the way they were. She writes terrible emo music, but then cries when no one likes it. Carter is a crime journalist but spends more time worried about balancing out the tree in the backyard and digging holes.Finally there's Enzo who is the worst rock star guitarist of all time. Everyone thinks he likes guys at the beginning of the film since he's shown making out with one early on. He becomes upset being called ""gay"" though, tries to be a tough guy by hiding in the restroom and drawing a knife on a deer, throws the term ""girlfriend"" around, and is totally into S&M; and dressing up in kinky and revealing outfits. You question if Enzo was just putting on an act to get noticed, but even then it doesn't excuse the drastic change in behavior later on. Xavier Samuel is treading familiar ground here as Enzo is awfully similar to Ian from ""Adore."" Enzo becomes a bit more complex in the final act, but the issue is he isn't crazy enough. He doesn't take the role far enough to really be intriguing. He mostly just throws a few temper tantrums and is expected to be taken as insane.""Plush"" feels too familiar to leave any sort of impression. It throws together a cast that is mostly full of actors from similar genres, but even then ""Plush"" seems like a rehash of everything each actor did previously. The erotic thriller gives too much time to this imitation band. It almost feels like a documentary behind the band, but not in the good ""This is Spinal Tap"" kind of way. The characters just aren't fleshed out properly as each one feels so flat, one-dimensional, and lacks any sort of depth at all.""Plush"" seems like a modern take on ""Fear"" with more sex, polished picture perfect actors, and crappier music, but the film is so bland that no one will take notice. It's ""Twilight"" writing set in an R-rated world. While ""Twilight"" fans will scream excitedly at the thought, the rest of us will gauge our eyes and ears out with the closest sharp and pointy object.Special features on the DVD include music videos Half of Me Remix (2:30) and Enzo Unleashed (2:15), two teaser trailers, and previews for ""Parkland,"" ""Hell Baby,"" ""What Maisie Knew,"" ""Stuck in Love,"" ""The Iceman,"" ""Upside Down,"" and ""As I Lay Dying.""",2,A mundane thriller that will leave you feeling lethargic,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,4325,"['big', 'selling', 'point', 'Plush', 'director', 'Twilight', 'true', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'also', 'directed', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'probably', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'Texas', 'born', 'director', 'previous', 'works', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'Xavier', 'Samuel', 'found', 'Twilight', 'sequels', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'mostly', 'bounced', 'horror', 'films', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Uninvited', 'consider', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'be', 'Assuming', 'Plush', 'overloaded', 'drama', 'packed', 'brim', 'sex', 'romance', 'pretty', 'fair', 'issue', 'writing', 'film', 'very', 'uneven', 'sloppy', 'opening', 'anything', 'next', 'hour', 'underground', 'mine', 'kind', 'mysterious', 'person', 'playing', 'mining', 'equipment', 'pulling', 'pulleys', 'wheeling', 'around', 'carts', 'full', 'rocks', 'girl', 'tied', 'up', 'chair', 'revealed', 'load', 'rocks', 'dumped', 'rockslide', 'killer', 'pile', 'out', 'woman', 'hand', 'restraint', 'off', 'wrist', 'turning', 'hand', 'palm', 'up', 'see', 'title', 'film', 'veins', 'wrist', 'really', 'obnoxious', 'music', 'play', 'opening', 'credits', 'begin', 'film', 'mostly', 'out', 'other', 'romantic', 'drama', 'happily', 'married', 'woman', 'somehow', 'comfort', 'tragic', 'event', 'bad', 'boy', 'closest', 'something', 'husband', 'can', 'not', 'somehow', 'completely', 'switches', 'gears', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'tries', 'be', 'heart', 'racing', 'thriller', 'borderline', 'horror', 'times.The', 'music', 'film', 'just', 'noise', 'loud', 'sounds', 'most', 'lyrics', 'replaced', 'screaming', 'moans', 'groans', 'be', 'industrial', 'song', 'exactly', 'same', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'culprits', 'terrible', 'writing', 'Hayley', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'why', 'life', 'direction', 'time', 'everything', 'fan', 'poor', 'decision', 'poor', 'decision', 'then', 'wonders', 'why', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'back', 'way', 'were', 'terrible', 'emo', 'music', 'then', 'cries', 'when', 'one', 'Carter', 'crime', 'journalist', 'more', 'time', 'worried', 'balancing', 'out', 'tree', 'backyard', 'digging', 'holes.Finally', 'Enzo', 'who', 'worst', 'rock', 'star', 'guitarist', 'time', 'Everyone', 'guys', 'beginning', 'film', 'shown', 'making', 'out', 'one', 'early', 'upset', 'being', 'called', 'gay', 'tries', 'be', 'tough', 'guy', 'hiding', 'restroom', 'drawing', 'knife', 'deer', 'term', 'girlfriend', 'totally', 'S', 'M', 'dressing', 'up', 'kinky', 'revealing', 'outfits', 'question', 'Enzo', 'was', 'just', 'putting', 'act', 'get', 'noticed', 'even', 'then', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'drastic', 'change', 'behavior', 'later', 'Xavier', 'Samuel', 'treading', 'familiar', 'ground', 'here', 'Enzo', 'awfully', 'similar', 'Ian', 'Adore', 'Enzo', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'final', 'act', 'issue', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'enough', ""n't"", 'take', 'role', 'far', 'enough', 'really', 'be', 'intriguing', 'mostly', 'just', 'few', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'expected', 'be', 'taken', 'insane', 'Plush', 'feels', 'too', 'familiar', 'leave', 'sort', 'impression', 'together', 'cast', 'mostly', 'full', 'actors', 'similar', 'genres', 'even', 'then', 'Plush', 'rehash', 'everything', 'actor', 'did', 'previously', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'imitation', 'band', 'almost', 'feels', 'documentary', 'band', 'not', 'good', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'kind', 'way', 'characters', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'properly', 'one', 'feels', 'so', 'flat', 'one-dimensional', 'sort', 'depth', 'Plush', 'modern', 'take', 'Fear', 'more', 'sex', 'polished', 'picture', 'perfect', 'actors', 'crappier', 'music', 'film', 'so', 'bland', 'one', 'will', 'take', 'notice', 'Twilight', 'writing', 'set', 'R-rated', 'world', 'Twilight', 'fans', 'will', 'scream', 'excitedly', 'thought', 'rest', 'will', 'gauge', 'eyes', 'out', 'closest', 'sharp', 'pointy', 'object.Special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'music', 'videos', 'Half', 'Me', 'Remix', '2:30', 'Enzo', 'Unleashed', '2:15', 'two', 'teaser', 'trailers', 'previews', 'Parkland', 'Hell', 'Baby', 'What', 'Maisie', 'Knew', 'Stuck', 'Love', 'Iceman', 'Upside', 'Down', 'Lay', 'Dying']",Plush

1667301,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00EI3YG0K,Paul Allaer,"[7, 11]","""Plush"" (2013 release; 99 min.) is the name of a rock band fronted by singer Hayley (think of her as Amy Lee of Evanescence-meets-Hayley Williams of Paramore) and her brother Jack who plays the electric guitar. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, Jack dies of a drug overdose, and Hayley must plow on with the band. Jack's replacement in the band, Enzo, is openly gay but nevertheless has his eyes on Hayley, who is married (to Carter) with 2 young kids. Being on the road and insecure, Hayley finally gives in to Enzo's advances and they start a blazing hot affair. While all this is happening, a creepy guy who claims to be a mega-fan of Hayley keeps following her around. At the end of the tour when Hayley returns hom, Enzo manages to befriend her kids and Carter. At this point we are not even halfway into the movie. Will Hayley and Enzo continue their affair? Does Enzo have his eyes also on Carter? Can Hayley and Carter save their marriage? And what are the real motives of that creepy fan stalking Hayley? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience of this plot-heavy movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is directed, co-written and co-produced by Catherine Hardwicke, who brought us the first of the ""Twilight"" movies, and more recently ""Red Riding Hood"", just to name those. This movie displays very much the same touch as ""Twilight"", even if the subject matter is quite different. Second, the music plays a HUGE role in this movie, and comes from uber-producer Nick Launay (Nick Cave, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Grinderman, and many others). The music itself is definitely along the Evanescence-meets-Paramore lines. Third, the acting performances were not quite as good or as believable as I had hoped. When you see Emily Browning on the screen as Hayley, I simply wasn't convinced that this was a real, troubled rock star on the screen (which of course she isn't--but her job is to have me believe that she is). Last but certainly not least, there are some 'erotic' scenes (including some hints of S&M;) in the movie, which I frankly found anything but that. But if these things are objectionable to you, save yourself the trouble and watch a different movie.""Plush"" opened without any pre-release fanfare or advertizing whatsoever on a single screen here in Greater Cincinnati last weekend, and when I noticed it would already be gone tomorrow, I went ahead to see this today on the last day it's in the theatre here. Not surprisingly, the screening was not well attended (3 people to be exact, including myself). That aside, ""Plush"" turns out to be okay and superficially enjoyable.",4,"3.5 stars... from the director of the first ""Twilight"" movie",1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,2686,"['Plush', '2013', 'release', '99', 'min', 'name', 'rock', 'band', 'fronted', 'singer', 'Hayley', 'think', 'Amy', 'Lee', 'Evanescence-meets-Hayley', 'Williams', 'Paramore', 'brother', 'Jack', 'who', 'electric', 'guitar', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Jack', 'drug', 'overdose', 'Hayley', 'must', 'plow', 'band', 'Jack', 'replacement', 'band', 'Enzo', 'openly', 'gay', 'nevertheless', 'eyes', 'Hayley', 'who', 'married', 'Carter', '2', 'young', 'kids', 'Being', 'road', 'insecure', 'Hayley', 'finally', 'Enzo', 'advances', 'start', 'blazing', 'hot', 'affair', 'happening', 'creepy', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'mega-fan', 'Hayley', 'keeps', 'following', 'around', 'end', 'tour', 'when', 'Hayley', 'hom', 'Enzo', 'befriend', 'kids', 'Carter', 'point', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'halfway', 'movie', 'Will', 'Hayley', 'Enzo', 'continue', 'affair', 'Does', 'Enzo', 'have', 'eyes', 'also', 'Carter', 'Can', 'Hayley', 'Carter', 'save', 'marriage', 'are', 'real', 'motives', 'creepy', 'fan', 'stalking', 'Hayley', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'surely', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', 'plot-heavy', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'movie', 'directed', 'co-written', 'co-produced', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'who', 'brought', 'first', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'more', 'recently', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'just', 'name', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'touch', 'Twilight', 'even', 'subject', 'matter', 'quite', 'different', 'Second', 'music', 'HUGE', 'role', 'movie', 'uber-producer', 'Nick', 'Launay', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'Yeah', 'Yeah', 'Yeahs', 'Grinderman', 'many', 'others', 'music', 'definitely', 'Evanescence-meets-Paramore', 'lines', 'Third', 'acting', 'performances', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'believable', 'had', 'hoped', 'When', 'see', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'screen', 'Hayley', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'was', 'real', 'troubled', 'rock', 'star', 'screen', 'course', ""n't"", 'job', 'have', 'believe', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'are', ""'erotic"", 'scenes', 'including', 'hints', 'S', 'M', 'movie', 'frankly', 'found', 'anything', 'things', 'are', 'objectionable', 'save', 'trouble', 'watch', 'different', 'movie', 'Plush', 'opened', 'pre-release', 'fanfare', 'advertizing', 'whatsoever', 'single', 'screen', 'here', 'Greater', 'Cincinnati', 'last', 'weekend', 'when', 'noticed', 'would', 'already', 'be', 'gone', 'tomorrow', 'went', 'ahead', 'see', 'today', 'last', 'day', 'theatre', 'here', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'screening', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'attended', '3', 'people', 'be', 'exact', 'including', 'aside', 'Plush', 'out', 'be', 'okay', 'superficially', 'enjoyable']",Plush
