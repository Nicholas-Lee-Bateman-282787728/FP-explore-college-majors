1603668,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,B00A1AU6VC,Classic film buff,"[5, 7]","The above quote is from the Old Testament of the Bible, specifically the book the ""Song of Songs"" also known as the ""Song of Solomon"", and the `turtle' referred to is not the reptile, but the turtle dove. It's my favorite line from the film and also one of my favorite quotes for the season of spring. This is a film adaption of a romantic comedy by John Van Druten, that was one of the biggest smash hits on Broadway in the 1940's, opening  December 8, 1943 and running for 1,557 performances finally closing in 1948.Here's a synopsis, Sally Middleton (Eleanor Parker), a young, rather nave struggling actress in Manhattan during World War II is nursing a bruised heart as the result of a recent unhappy love affair with a married Broadway producer Kenneth Bartlett (Kent Smith).  Although it's technically spring, the weather isn't cooperating, and she feels in her present state of mind that spring is never going to arrive.  One rainy Friday afternoon, her older, savvier actress friend Olive Lashbrooke (Eve Arden) drops by for a visit and cocktails.  Olive is having a soldier acquaintance Sergeant Bill Page (Ronald Reagan) pick her up at Sally's for a weekend"" fling"".  While she waits Olive checks her phone messages and finds that her current heartthrob Commander Ned Burling (Wayne Morris) is in town for the weekend and wants to see her.  To ditch Bill gracefully, Olive cooks up a bogus story that she is meeting her estranged husband because it is his last leave before he will be shipped overseas.  She leaves Bill and Sally together, since neither has plans Bill takes Sally out to dinner, and they have a warm rapport.  As the weekend progresses they spend it together at the apartment and begin to fall in love.  However, Sally is scared to risk her heart a third time, (she had another failed romance ahead of the more recent one), and she is determined to keep things light, romance yes, love no.  Bill himself burned once before is willing to open his heart, but also is determined not to be in love unhappily.  Meanwhile Olive disillusioned by Ned's changes since the last time she saw him, is annoyed to lose Bill to Sally, and starts to meddle.In 1943, when ""The Voice of the Turtle"" opened on Broadway, the play was considered rather daring and groundbreaking.  Sally Middleton though a well-bred ""nice"" young lady has had two love affairs and isn't a virgin, and she sleeps with Bill the second night they're together.  Definitely not your usual ingenue at that time!  However with the Hays Code still going strong in Hollywood, in the film Sally and Bill do NOT make love, although tempted, and Sally's romantic past is soft pedaled. The inference is that despite the two prior relationships,Sally is still unblemished. Playwright John Van Druten skillfully toned down his play when adapting it to the screen without losing any of its charm.It's regrettable however that the movie suffers from miscasting in the role of Sally, and in a lesser degree in that of Bill.  One of my favorite classical film actresses the luminous, legendary Margaret Sullavan originated the role of Sally Middleton.  This was a much praised performance, she won the Donaldson Award for Best Actress (a predecessor of the Tony Awards for theatrical excellence), and was the definitive factor in the success of the play.  It remains her most memorable stage performance.  Ms. Sullavan was 38 however when the movie was made, past playing a 22 year old girl, and although she excelled in film, it was not her favorite m&eacute;tier, she preferred the stage. So, the role was given to Eleanor Parker, suitably girlish, BUT sporting the same hairstyle and a similar voice to that of Sullavan, and frankly she imitates her at times.  I don't know whether she was directed that way or not, but I've never been fond of carbon copies. Although Ms. Parker tries earnestly, and has some good moments, she doesn't have the stardust to light up the screen, and has a couple of ""cute"" pieces of business that are overdone. The perfect choice would have been Judy Garland, who at that point was at the peak of her film career; she would have brought a radiance and vulnerability to the role, similar in many ways to her sensitive portrayal in 1945's ""The Clock.""  I remember reading somewhere that Van Druten had Garland in mind when he created the role of Sally Middleton; a pity she didn't get a chance to play it on the screen.Ronald Reagan fares better, his playing of Bill Page is one of his best performances in his rather limited range as an actor, he's relaxed and likeable, a good standard issue leading man.  Still it would have been interesting to have one of the better young actors of the day say Gregory Peck, Joseph Cotten or William Holden in the role.The real winner who comes close to stealing the film at times is Eve Arden as Olive Lashbrooke.  Even though she is playing a kind of heavy, Ms. Arden does it with a panache and dry humor similar to Rosalind Russell's Sylvia in ""The Women"".  It's not possible to dislike her; you can only shake your head and laugh at her vain, self-absorbed prattling. Her final line is a clever one reworked by Van Druten to get by the censors, and delivered directly to the camera.To finish, although it's necessarily dated, ""The Voice of the Turtle"" is still a lighthearted, engaging remembrance of a more innocent, simpler era. It has a winsome charm that is most refreshing in this current jaded age.  If you are a romantic at heart, you will want to experience its sweet, nostalgic pleasures.",4,"""The rain is over, the winter is past, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
