One thing that really bugs me, is the bleeping of the swear words. Just like Ramsey's Kitchen shows. This is the man and this is how he talks. These are plain, rough, hard working guys and this is how they talk to each other and probably around their homes, unless the ""little Woman"" puts a clamp on them. Let it go, or at least on the dvd's an uncut/ uncensored version should be offered. Just like Rap music, they would probably find the uncut/uncensored would sell tons more that the annoyingly bleeped version. If it is bleeped, I won't be buying it. sorry folks. Some of the guys say they are being reconized down here in the lower 48, but this show hasn't been shown yet in Canada, so they are not reconized yet in their own stomping grounds.

I had to see this from the beginning, so I got the first season asap and sat down for what turned out to be about three hours to watch these guys making trips across the ice roads over frozen lakes and rivers. They drive trailer trucks loaded with tons of cargo across 36"" of ice...they hope. The roads melt at the end of six weeks and the truckers (who we get to know very, very well) compete for the load count lead. I learned about trucks and truckers, and a little about myself i guess. By the way, this isn't just a guy thing...my wife and I both love the show; she sees things about the people and I am all about the trucks and the roads.

This is a great series.I hardly would have imagined the degree to which I would be interested in a profession and geographical location about which I know nothing and would hardly be concerned with, generally.  This material is a study in human endurance, sheer force of will, struggle against unbelievably harsh and cruel natural forces, and lots of human interaction through all the mess.For someone who is totally unfamiliar with this series, it focuses on roughly a half dozen truckers (out of about 800) who move extremely heavy, valuable, and hazardous loads across hundreds of miles of ice lakes during the roughly two month winter season when the temperatures reach -40 degrees, F.  A breakdown or a ""fender bender"" can become a life-threatening situation.  The pressure is increased because of the very short time period in which the ice is stable for supporting the trucks, and mechanical breakdowns, common enough at any temperature, become freakishly ever-present at these extreme temperatures, fueling friction between the truckers, their families, and producing lots of material for the series.At times the series borders on overdoing the drama with excessive narration and the occasional ""looping"" of crucial events, but it hardly detracts from the real drama.Overall, it's a riveting slice of life that is exceptionally well produced and packaged.  I think you'll be glad you invested your time in this, whether or not a ""trucking series"" sounds interesting to you.",5,Inexplicably fascinating,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,1580,"['happened', 'see', 'tiny', 'bit', 'first', 'episode', 'waiting', 'barber', 'was', 'hooked', 'great', 'series.I', 'hardly', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'degree', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'profession', 'geographical', 'location', 'know', 'nothing', 'would', 'hardly', 'be', 'concerned', 'generally', 'material', 'study', 'human', 'endurance', 'sheer', 'force', 'will', 'struggle', 'unbelievably', 'harsh', 'cruel', 'natural', 'forces', 'lots', 'human', 'interaction', 'mess.For', 'someone', 'who', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', 'series', 'roughly', 'half', 'dozen', 'truckers', '800', 'who', 'move', 'extremely', 'heavy', 'valuable', 'hazardous', 'loads', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'ice', 'lakes', 'roughly', 'two', 'month', 'winter', 'season', 'when', 'temperatures', 'reach', '-40', 'degrees', 'F.', 'A', 'breakdown', 'fender', 'bender', 'can', 'become', 'life-threatening', 'situation', 'pressure', 'increased', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'period', 'ice', 'stable', 'supporting', 'trucks', 'mechanical', 'breakdowns', 'common', 'enough', 'temperature', 'become', 'freakishly', 'ever-present', 'extreme', 'temperatures', 'fueling', 'friction', 'truckers', 'families', 'producing', 'lots', 'material', 'series.At', 'series', 'borders', 'overdoing', 'drama', 'excessive', 'narration', 'occasional', 'looping', 'crucial', 'events', 'hardly', 'real', 'drama.Overall', 'riveting', 'slice', 'life', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'produced', 'packaged', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'invested', 'time', 'not', 'trucking', 'series', 'interesting']",Ice Road Truckers: Season 1

1095847,A19SPM4Y7A8OHN,B000UP8822,MrQ,"[9, 11]","2/29/2008This is one of the better little jewels to come along in a while. I liken it to the Deadliest Catch series, not in terms of danger and risk (nothing can top DC for that), but because it is one of those small little-known niche jobs that relatively few know about, has been going on for decades, and to a newcomer like this reviewer, is just jaw-dropping.For a time there was a forum on the IRT website for fans to discuss this show. I was able to read it for roughly one week before history.com pulled it. It was surprising to see several individuals, each claiming they worked the Ice Roads or lived in the vicinity, venting their anger over this show. They complained about the ""hyping"" done by the show in order to garner viewers, making the truckers out to be something they are not, and leaving out some key individuals and companies who made Ice Roads a reality. None of their arguments seemed plausible to me. Nevertheless, it did raise a question about the season I had just watched.As someone who has never driven BUT HAS rode in a semi while pulling a load, if anyone challenged me with the chance to earn some good bucks for two month's worth of hauling loads, BUT, ""there's one thing: You will be hauling 25 to 50 ton loads across ice covered lakes, with sub-zero conditions."", I would tell them they were insane.That is the real point, and that's what makes this an awesome series. If there was any hype or leaving something out, it was never peceivable to this reviewer. In fact, when you actually ""see"" a tanker truck sitting there, with its rear wheels sunk three feet into the ice, any arguments made about hype is made null and void. True, they do have IR trucking down to a science now, with the accident rate being close to that on asphalt; however that IS MENTIONED on the DVDs. Even if the risk was zero, it would not dampen the thoughts of ""what if"". It has happened before.Also mentioned in the forums were discussions about the locals being unhappy with the show's producers---so much so that the conflict may result in the show not coming back again. If so, this is one viewer who would miss it. That being said, if you visit the IRT pages on history.com, there is no mention of a Season 2. For those who have never seen it, if you like reality-type shows, I recommend that you purchase this sight unseen. You will not be dissappointed.Finally, regarding the technical issues I have experienced with History Channel DVD's, I DO have my equipment connected correctly, and THERE ARE very large black borders around the picture. I actually have about 4 (our of 375 single/box-sets) with this same problem. Two are from the History Channel. Either most people do not notice this, and/or they do not consider it a nuisance, and/or it occurs only with a small number of equipment configurations. It is a peeve however---if anyone reading this has any resources to research the issue, I would appreciate it.1/9/2008This is an early review, primarily technical.Having just finished the first DVD of the collection, my first reaction is one of disgust. This is the second DVD series I've purchased with the ""History Channel"" logo (the other is ""The Race To The Moon""). Each is in widescreen format, however it is minimized on my television---there are thick 6 to 10 inch black borders surrounding the image on every side. Zooming the image, either via the TV or the DVD player, cause the image to be cropped significantly around every edge of the image.What's up with this? The results are the same on my Sony and Samsung DVD players. The only other DVD with this problem in my collection is Independence Day. Note that my collection comprises roughly 375 DVD's.The actual show is awesome, and I hope to return later and focus on that, however this problem is extremely irritating and worthy of warning the rest of you potential buyers.This is an early review, primarily technical.Having just finished the first DVD of the collection, my first reaction is one of disgust.

But one season will be enough for me; it just repeats, and repeats...on and on.  After you have watched one item, they skip onto something else, then come back and 'rehash' everything you just watched. While the show itself could have been so interesting, they took so much away. The material is fascinating and the men that do this kind of work are a totally different breed and I admire that. However, these shows could have been cut down to one disc and been far more entertaining.

This would have been a terrific two-hour special. But the producers had a lot of time to fill, and fill they did...with repetitive, monotonous footage, weak story lines, artificial and manipulative ""drama"", and lots of time spent repeating the same material over...and over...and over.I don't think I've ever seen a series that was so obviously stretched to fill the available time. The latter episodes were unwatchable thanks to the endless use of tired footage and shameless rehashing of earlier material.While Deadliest Catch is immensely watchable and thrilling to the end, this series falls far short of the high bar set by that program.",2,Poorly executed clone of Deadliest Catch,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,751,"['had', 'high', 'expectations', 'series', 'watching', 'primary', 'reaction', 'one', 'disappointment', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'two-hour', 'special', 'producers', 'had', 'lot', 'time', 'fill', 'fill', 'did', 'repetitive', 'monotonous', 'footage', 'weak', 'story', 'lines', 'artificial', 'manipulative', 'drama', 'lots', 'time', 'spent', 'repeating', 'same', 'material', 'over.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'obviously', 'stretched', 'fill', 'available', 'time', 'latter', 'episodes', 'were', 'unwatchable', 'thanks', 'endless', 'use', 'tired', 'footage', 'shameless', 'rehashing', 'earlier', 'material.While', 'Deadliest', 'Catch', 'immensely', 'watchable', 'thrilling', 'end', 'series', 'far', 'short', 'high', 'bar', 'set', 'program']",Ice Road Truckers: Season 1

Watched it the first time and I was on the edge of my seat just watching these men drive out onto the thin, cracking ice with loads weighing up to more than 40,000 pounds as an average. Every turn of the corner, I was like, ""OMG, I would NOT want to be out there!"" These men are all heroes, but reading plenty of the negative reviews made them look otherwise.Let me just say this to those little whiners about the ""language"" content. Wake the hell up! These guys are out there for 2 months in freezing weather risking their lives on each bend in the road, every crack the ice makes, never knowing WHAT condition the road will ever be in, whether their truck will break down or their trailer falling through the ice. I have personally seen the trucker life myself, and have seen what truckers have to do to get a paycheck for the families they barely ever get to see. Meanwhile, the critics that whine about their bad language are all 9-to-5 idiots with cushy and comfy jobs and couldn't last FIVE MINUTES in the kind of stressful climate and job demands these truckers have, so if you don't want to hear the bleeps from their bad language, then shut the hell up and watch something else. Put on a Christian cartoon movie for you and your kids to watch if you have such ""virgin ears.""As for my review on this movie, I think the guys are all great in their own way. Hugh is pretty demanding on his trucker crews, but I've had bosses just as demanding as him, and his words of advice(swears included)pretty much show his style on how he's survived ice-road trucking since the 1980's. I like that he shows how he stays awake on long, tiring runs, which makes him come out on top each time as the ""Polar Bear."" Alex is cool, and becomes to be known as the funny Canadian with the hilarious laugh, with 30 years of trucking on his belt, his determination to stay cool in a bad situation, and his longing to help support an enormous family nearby at home. The other guys are pretty good, especially the one with the little girl at home that he rarely sees, but it's Drew that I kinda feel sorry for. He seems to expect everything to go smoothly with his runs, but gets plagued with breakdowns all the time and ends up quitting from all the built-up stress of staying in a motel and losing over $1000 a day. He comes back in Season 2, though, and I wonder if he'll be on any of the seasons to come.Looking forward to the new season being made about the ice roads in Manitoba! And the ice-road veterans will surely have a lot to learn there even after all their experiences on the dangerous roads in Canada and Alaska.",5,Truckers in reality situations...WATCH OUT!,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,2746,"['movie', 'being', 'played', 'right', 'now', 'Freaking', 'awesome', 'Watched', '4', 'seasons', 'Netflix', 'decided', 'wanted', 'movie', 'collection', 'Watched', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'just', 'watching', 'men', 'drive', 'out', 'thin', 'cracking', 'ice', 'loads', 'weighing', 'up', 'more', '40,000', 'pounds', 'average', 'turn', 'corner', 'was', 'OMG', 'would', 'NOT', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'men', 'are', 'heroes', 'reading', 'plenty', 'negative', 'reviews', 'made', 'look', 'just', 'say', 'little', 'whiners', 'language', 'content', 'Wake', 'hell', 'up', 'guys', 'are', 'there', '2', 'months', 'freezing', 'weather', 'risking', 'lives', 'bend', 'road', 'crack', 'ice', 'never', 'knowing', 'WHAT', 'condition', 'road', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'truck', 'will', 'break', 'down', 'trailer', 'falling', 'ice', 'have', 'personally', 'seen', 'trucker', 'life', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'truckers', 'have', 'do', 'get', 'paycheck', 'families', 'barely', 'ever', 'get', 'see', 'Meanwhile', 'critics', 'whine', 'bad', 'language', 'are', '9-to-5', 'idiots', 'cushy', 'comfy', 'jobs', 'could', ""n't"", 'last', 'FIVE', 'MINUTES', 'kind', 'stressful', 'climate', 'job', 'demands', 'truckers', 'have', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'bleeps', 'bad', 'language', 'then', 'shut', 'hell', 'up', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'Put', 'Christian', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'kids', 'watch', 'have', 'such', 'virgin', 'ears', 'review', 'movie', 'think', 'guys', 'are', 'great', 'own', 'way', 'Hugh', 'pretty', 'demanding', 'trucker', 'crews', ""'ve"", 'had', 'bosses', 'just', 'as', 'demanding', 'words', 'advice', 'swears', 'included', 'pretty', 'much', 'show', 'style', 'how', 'survived', 'ice-road', 'trucking', '1980', 'like', 'how', 'awake', 'long', 'tiring', 'runs', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'time', 'Polar', 'Bear', 'Alex', 'cool', 'be', 'known', 'funny', 'Canadian', 'hilarious', 'laugh', '30', 'years', 'trucking', 'belt', 'determination', 'stay', 'cool', 'bad', 'situation', 'longing', 'help', 'support', 'enormous', 'family', 'nearby', 'home', 'other', 'guys', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'one', 'little', 'girl', 'home', 'rarely', 'Drew', 'kinda', 'feel', 'sorry', 'expect', 'everything', 'go', 'smoothly', 'runs', 'plagued', 'breakdowns', 'time', 'up', 'quitting', 'built-up', 'stress', 'staying', 'motel', 'losing', '1000', 'day', 'back', 'Season', '2', 'though', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seasons', 'come.Looking', 'forward', 'new', 'season', 'being', 'made', 'ice', 'roads', 'Manitoba', 'ice-road', 'veterans', 'will', 'surely', 'have', 'lot', 'learn', 'there', 'even', 'experiences', 'dangerous', 'roads', 'Canada', 'Alaska']",Ice Road Truckers: Season 1
