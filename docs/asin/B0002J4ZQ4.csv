836889,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,B0002J4ZQ4,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[34, 42]","A Bible on DVD is a great idea.  You get the best of both worlds: an audio Bible read by a professional orator, PLUS on-screen text so you can easily read along.Unfortunately, this particular DVD Bible leaves much to be desired.  First, there's the translation itself:  The New Living Translation is adequate; but there are much better contemporary English translations out there.  Second, there are the voices:  Though the main narrator does a good job; the cast of actors who read the dialogue have annoying voices that quickly get on your nerves; and they tend to ""overact"" their parts.  Third, there's the background music and sound effects:  They are distracting, and don't contribute much to one's appreciation of the text.  (Plus, the same music is played over and over again; so it gets old pretty  quick.)  Fourth, there are lots of typos in the on-screen text; the narrator occasionally skips over or misreads words; and the on-screen text doesn't always sync up with the narration (sometimes the narrator gets ahead of the on-screen text; and sometimes the on-screen text gets ahead of the narrator).  Fifth, there's the navigation:  You can go to the start of a specific chapter; but not to a specific verse.  And you can't rewind or fast forward -- you can only skip back or forward by chapters.All in all, this is not a good DVD Bible.  I hope I can find a better one.",1,Not so great,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,1382,"['Bible', 'DVD', 'great', 'idea', 'get', 'best', 'worlds', 'audio', 'Bible', 'read', 'professional', 'orator', 'PLUS', 'on-screen', 'text', 'can', 'easily', 'read', 'along.Unfortunately', 'particular', 'DVD', 'Bible', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'First', 'translation', 'New', 'Living', 'Translation', 'adequate', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'contemporary', 'English', 'translations', 'out', 'there', 'Second', 'are', 'voices', 'main', 'narrator', 'good', 'job', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'read', 'dialogue', 'have', 'annoying', 'voices', 'quickly', 'get', 'nerves', 'tend', 'overact', 'parts', 'Third', 'background', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'distracting', 'do', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'much', 'one', 'appreciation', 'text', 'same', 'music', 'played', 'over', 'again', 'old', 'pretty', 'quick', 'Fourth', 'are', 'lots', 'typos', 'on-screen', 'text', 'narrator', 'occasionally', 'misreads', 'words', 'on-screen', 'text', ""n't"", 'always', 'sync', 'up', 'narration', 'sometimes', 'narrator', 'ahead', 'on-screen', 'text', 'on-screen', 'text', 'ahead', 'narrator', 'Fifth', 'navigation', 'can', 'go', 'start', 'specific', 'chapter', 'not', 'specific', 'verse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rewind', 'fast', 'forward', 'can', 'only', 'skip', 'back', 'forward', 'chapters.All', 'not', 'good', 'DVD', 'Bible', 'hope', 'can', 'find', 'better', 'one']",N/A

I get up in the morning and sit back in the comfy chair with a cup of joe and read the Bible from the big TV while it is being read to me. There are two DVD's, not one. Disc 1 is the old; disc 2 is the new. You can control the book and chapter with your remote control, stop, pause, or do whatever your dvd player allows. The tv screen looks like a book that is open, two pages at a time. The music is the back ground is very understated and the voice of the readers are lovely.

I have found it much better to just listen rather then try to read along with him. Since I want to try reading the Bible in 40 days, his pace will certainly help out.It does have background noises and music at times - though fortunately not constantly. While I don't care much for the background since I prefer voice only - I still really enjoy listening to this dvd and find it enjoyable to listen to.
