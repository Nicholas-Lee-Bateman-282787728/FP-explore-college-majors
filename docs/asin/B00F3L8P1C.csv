Brundidge,"[0, 0]","I'm not ashamed to say that I watched this show when it first appeared on the USA Network back in the mid 90's, and that I taped the majority of the episodes. It recently reappeared on the local THIS Channel in Connecticut and my kids saw it. My youngest son, a converted sci-fi fan, fell in love with it. When I found out that the complete series was available on DVD, I had to have it!! Watching the episodes (without commercial interruption), I come to appreciate it even more. It's not exactly the Power Rangers (which I also have on DVD), the special effects are not top-notch Daikaiju style, but the series has its own special appeal, particularly the actors playing the four kids, as well as those playing their Galactic Sentinel counterparts. This series is not only watchable, but re-watchable, and enjoyable.....but completely underrated. But, it's sci-fi. It's not really good sci-fi, it's not really bad sci-fi, but like all sci-fi, you have to dispel reality in order to enjoy it. So, take a chance and enjoy!!!",5,A Power Rangers rip-off  (???) with its own identity,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,1024,"[""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'say', 'watched', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'USA', 'Network', 'back', 'mid', '90', 'taped', 'majority', 'episodes', 'recently', 'reappeared', 'local', 'THIS', 'Channel', 'Connecticut', 'kids', 'saw', 'youngest', 'son', 'converted', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'fell', 'love', 'When', 'found', 'out', 'complete', 'series', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'had', 'have', 'Watching', 'episodes', 'commercial', 'interruption', 'come', 'appreciate', 'even', 'more', 'not', 'exactly', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'also', 'have', 'DVD', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'top-notch', 'Daikaiju', 'style', 'series', 'own', 'special', 'appeal', 'particularly', 'actors', 'playing', 'four', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'Galactic', 'Sentinel', 'counterparts', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'watchable', 're-watchable', 'enjoyable', '..but', 'completely', 'underrated', 'sci-fi', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'sci-fi', 'sci-fi', 'have', 'dispel', 'reality', 'order', 'enjoy', 'So', 'take', 'chance', 'enjoy']",Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters - The Complete Series

I say this because they're a bit more realistic because the characters don't really like each other, yet they fight together against evil aliens. Power Rangers on the other hand were too friendly to each other, which makes it seem less realistic when it comes to personality and behavior. My only gripe is the title of the show, which is way too long. I mean come on? Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills? I would have shorten it to Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters, or just Alien Fighters. Anyways I enjoyed this show when I was a kid. I'm sure people will love this too.",5,Better than Power Rangers.,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",2014,628,"['practically', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'done', 'right', 'say', ""'re"", 'bit', 'more', 'realistic', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'other', 'yet', 'fight', 'together', 'evil', 'aliens', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'too', 'friendly', 'other', 'seem', 'less', 'realistic', 'when', 'personality', 'behavior', 'only', 'gripe', 'title', 'show', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'mean', 'come', 'Tattooed', 'Teenage', 'Alien', 'Fighters', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'would', 'have', 'shorten', 'Tattooed', 'Teenage', 'Alien', 'Fighters', 'just', 'Alien', 'Fighters', 'Anyways', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'kid', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'too']",Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters - The Complete Series
