145064,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,0792840119,absent_minded_prof,"[0, 1]","First of all let me say, this flick has one heck of a great soundtrack.  I'm not slighting that in any way.  A couple things though...For one thing, I have a few issues with the scene where James Marsden is introduced to the cliques at Cradle Bay, by Nick Stahl.  Nick is terrific, don't get me wrong, but I just thought that the scene played up James Marsden's whole &quot;outsider&quot; thing a little too much.  Sure, there are dramatic reasons why that should be done, but does the director seriously expect us to swallow that James Marsden comes from somewhere where cliques like that don't exist?!!?  They're everywhere!  Face it.  They'll never go away.My other problem was just that, well, it seems too bad to make such a big deal out of &quot;high school&quot; as an experience, in some ways.  It's dramatic enough when you're in the middle of it -- sometimes I wonder if movies like this do more harm than good.  When you're that age, you're probably better off trying to look beyond it, to your twenties, when whatever problems you might have, at least you have some choices about what you do everyday. Just a thought.Beyond that, it's a fun movie.  It makes real statements -- not incredibly original ones, but real statements.  I can respect that.  Still, whoever reads this, please think about what I said above.

145065,AZSN1TO0JI87B,0792840119,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","A sci-fi/horror flick aimed at the ""Scream"" crowd, ""Disturbing Behavior"" concerns at idyllic coastal town where everything seems just a bit too peachy. The local high school is populated by picture perfect teens who, despite their wholesome love of yogurt, tend to get a little trigger happy when the hormones start flying. When the new kid in town (Jason Marsden) stumbles upon a dark secret, it's up to him and a few other mistfits (Nick Stahl, Katie Holmes) to shut down the powers that be.There's loads of potential in this film that is, unfortunately, never capitalized upon. You can thank the editing department for that one. If the deleted scenes are any evidence, this movie was trimmed and dumbed down to the point of no recognition. While the uninterrupted flow makes for an easy, breezy viewing, the overall story lacks substance and coherence. Its 84 minute running time, in turn, is a redeeming feature.The director, David Nutter, spends much of the film building up ample amounts of atmosphere and is aided wonderfully by a brilliant score by fellow ""X-Files"" alumnus Mark Snow as well as some striking scenery thanks to it's Vancouver location. So, the film isn't a complete waste. You'll get some kicks out of the dialog and while Katie Holmes in particular isn't given much to do, she at least looks good in skimpy outfits while doing so. Also, it's hard to hate on a movie that is of a more intelligent cut than the other teen-geared fare being produced in its time. The movie at least aims high, and even when it doesn't quite reach, it never bores.A passable sci-fi teen romp, ""Disturbing Behavior"" is entertaining late-night fodder that, surprisingly, will inspire repeat viewings.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","With such a threatening title as ""Disturbing Behavior"", I went in fully expecting a suspense to REALLY go out of its way to deliver the most sickening storyline imaginable. I didn't get anything like that. Far from it really (unless a psychotic kid with a magical power to toss all his classmates around a supermarket or lunch room in a fit of unexplainable rage qualifies as disturbing? Nah, it's just silly).This is just another in a long line of late 90's low budget thrillers that tries to make itself look better than it really is. By that I mean, the writing, the acting skills by all the actors involved, and most importantly the storytelling is NOWHERE near as good as the film writers and producers tried making us believe. It's honestly not. That makes Disturbing Behavior a pretty overrated film that didn't age very well.Honestly, back in the late 90's when Hollywood movies went through another change, I was certain a movie like this would age amazingly well, but now -12 years later- I have to wonder if a film such as Disturbing Behavior is really any better than any of those cheesy 80's horror/suspense flicks we all used to make fun of. I don't really think it is any better to be honest.Oh well, complaints aside, Disturbing Behavior is still watchable with a passable storyline.Katie Holmes is absolutely *smoking* hot though, so that somewhat makes up for all the flaws.

As probably the majority of people reading this do not have DVD (myself included) I  shall review the VHS version.One of the main reasons that people are so  critical of this film seems to be that they think it is horror, or trying  to be of that genre. I would disagree, and suggest that it is simply an  attempt at a suspense film, and as a suspense film, it fared OK. I was not  really surprised at any point during the film, but some girls that I saw it  with were, proving that it is effective to those who don't follow the  genre.Some positive aspects of the film were its scripting originality,  ending, cast, and from memory, sountrack. The ending is one everyone has  seen before, and will probably see again, but fairly well done, the  suspense scenes are fairly well constructed, although failing to really  deliver, and the cast, while mainly good for star attraction, managed their  roles fairly well.Overall, this is a fairly good film, with nothing  really wrong, but there is no one aspect that makes it stand out above the  rest.

Can Steve (James Marsden) and new girlfriend Rachel (Katie Holmes-TV's Dawson's Creek) maintain their identities long enough to solve the mystery? This one can't get past the fact that it is cribbed from so many other movies (The Stepford Children, Strange Behavior). Also, though Marsden and Holmes are okay, there's not enough character development here for them to sink their teeth into.  The most telling factor is that the distribution company believed they had a dog on their hands and chopped this down to a bare bones 74 minutes. This does keep the film moving along, but a little more character development or a few more ""quiet moments"" might have helped flesh this out.

145074,A2XWU6Y8PF8L17,0792840119,"CreepyT ""CreepyTendencies""","[12, 14]","This film starts out well enough, with a family moving to the odd little town of Cradle Bay seeking a fresh start, and an escape from the haunting memory of a son and brother who committed suicide.  When the family arrives, the town seems eerily too-good-to-be-true.  The ""kitschy"" small town flare, complete with that ""everybody knows everybody else"" sentimentality, is almost nauseating.  How very clich&eacute; (can we say ""Stephen King?"").When the family's two remaining children (one of them being James Marsden's character, Steve Clark) head out for their first day of school, it becomes easy to discern, to the viewer at least, that something is horribly awry.  Sure, the usual high school cliques are present.  However, they seem far too exaggerated.  For example, the omnipotent ""Blue Ribbons"" (a.k.a. ""jocks"") are the school's best athletes, as well as the school's most academically inclined students.  Few exceptions aside, is this generally the case?  I think not.  Furthermore, these students hang out at a yogurt shoppe.  It's no longer the 50's, and most high schoolers have other various hang-outs.  Yet another clue that should give the new arrivals some insight as to the odd goings-on in Cradle Bay.  However, when Nick Stahl's character (Gavin) attempts to inform Steve Clark of the evil plot that is behind the Blue Ribbons and their oddly uniform characters, Steve remains clueless.  It takes Gavin becoming a Blue Ribbon himself to spark the light bulb in Steve's head, and he then decides to discover the root of the evil.With the help of a fellow student, Rachel (Katie Holmes), and a very cheesily written but well acted school janitor (Dan Zudovic), Steve uncovers the extremely ""Stepford Wives-esque"" plot.  The mad scientist behind it all is unveiled just before Rachel and Steve are themselves to become Blue Ribbons.  Together they must find a way out of their predicament before it's too late.  Thus, the movie comes to it's extremely harried ""grand"" finale.This film seems well-conceived, and probably could have been much better than it was in actuality.  It would have been interesting to see more of the teenage angst, rebellion, and struggle for individuality yet desire to fit in developed in some of these characters.  Perhaps then they would not have seemed so soulless and one-dimensional.  The plot, though cheesy and cliched, began with some decent build up.  However, the ending was a bit of a let down.  Furthermore, some of the plot elements never quite seem to come to fruition, and the deleted scenes included on the DVD extras only partially solve this problem.  Many of the scenes were also far too unrealistic.  For example, the creepy, dank atmosphere at the asylum and the completely incoherent nature of every patient there seemed far too over-the-top.  Not all of those institutionalized mumble, drool, and traipse around like zombies.Overall, this film is decent for a rental, but not worth the money to purchase.",3,Decent plot and acting meet poor writing,1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,2970,"['film', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'family', 'moving', 'odd', 'little', 'town', 'Cradle', 'Bay', 'seeking', 'fresh', 'start', 'escape', 'haunting', 'memory', 'son', 'brother', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'When', 'family', 'town', 'eerily', 'too-good-to-be-true', 'kitschy', 'small', 'town', 'flare', 'complete', 'everybody', 'everybody', 'else', 'sentimentality', 'almost', 'nauseating', 'How', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'say', 'Stephen', 'King', '.When', 'family', 'two', 'remaining', 'children', 'one', 'being', 'James', 'Marsden', 'character', 'Steve', 'Clark', 'head', 'out', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'easy', 'discern', 'viewer', 'least', 'something', 'horribly', 'awry', 'Sure', 'usual', 'high', 'school', 'cliques', 'are', 'present', 'However', 'seem', 'far', 'too', 'exaggerated', 'example', 'omnipotent', 'Blue', 'Ribbons', 'a.k.a', 'jocks', 'are', 'school', 'best', 'athletes', 'as', 'well', 'school', 'most', 'academically', 'inclined', 'students', 'Few', 'exceptions', 'aside', 'generally', 'case', 'think', 'not', 'Furthermore', 'students', 'hang', 'out', 'yogurt', 'shoppe', 'no', 'longer', '50', 'most', 'high', 'schoolers', 'have', 'other', 'various', 'hang-outs', 'clue', 'should', 'give', 'new', 'arrivals', 'insight', 'odd', 'goings-on', 'Cradle', 'Bay', 'However', 'when', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'character', 'Gavin', 'inform', 'Steve', 'Clark', 'evil', 'plot', 'Blue', 'Ribbons', 'oddly', 'uniform', 'characters', 'Steve', 'clueless', 'Gavin', 'becoming', 'Blue', 'Ribbon', 'spark', 'light', 'bulb', 'Steve', 'head', 'then', 'discover', 'root', 'evil.With', 'help', 'fellow', 'student', 'Rachel', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'very', 'cheesily', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'school', 'janitor', 'Dan', 'Zudovic', 'Steve', 'extremely', 'Stepford', 'Wives-esque', 'plot', 'mad', 'scientist', 'unveiled', 'just', 'Rachel', 'Steve', 'are', 'become', 'Blue', 'Ribbons', 'Together', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'predicament', 'too', 'late', 'Thus', 'movie', 'extremely', 'harried', 'grand', 'finale.This', 'film', 'well-conceived', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'actuality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'more', 'teenage', 'angst', 'rebellion', 'struggle', 'individuality', 'yet', 'desire', 'fit', 'developed', 'characters', 'Perhaps', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seemed', 'so', 'soulless', 'one-dimensional', 'plot', 'cheesy', 'cliched', 'began', 'decent', 'build', 'up', 'However', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'Furthermore', 'plot', 'elements', 'never', 'quite', 'seem', 'come', 'fruition', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'DVD', 'only', 'partially', 'solve', 'problem', 'Many', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'far', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'example', 'creepy', 'dank', 'atmosphere', 'asylum', 'completely', 'incoherent', 'nature', 'patient', 'there', 'seemed', 'far', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'Not', 'institutionalized', 'mumble', 'drool', 'traipse', 'zombies.Overall', 'film', 'decent', 'rental', 'not', 'money', 'purchase']",Disturbing Behavior VHS

Steve (James Marsden) makes a friend out of a bright, but unambitioned stoner who witnesses a double murder of a girl and a cop that is oddly covered up by another police officer.  Gavin (Nick Stahl) belives that there is a conspiracy, that students once only interested in drugs, sex, and cars are now being changed against their will to the become straight laced and academically proud pillars of the community.

145078,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,0792840119,D. Mok,"[9, 11]","Much has been said about this being a Scream ripoff.  Here's my verdict based on my horror-film experience and my observation on the technical execution of Disturbing Behavior:From screenwriting, directing and  cinematographic points of view, Disturbing Behavior has NOTHING to do with  ANY of the Scream movies.Scream and Scream 2 were self-referential  commentaries on the horror genre while frankly (and dare I say not very  effectively) using the conventions of slasher films for cheap thrills.  The  value of the Scream movies was in the comedic elements:  The wink-wink,  nudge-nudge to people who know slasher films well.  The impact of Scream,  if it has impact on you, is strictly personal, as are the relationships of  the characters.  (If anything, Urban Legend is an extension of this  approach).Disturbing Behavior is on the opposite end of the spectrum.  Sociological in its impact and its intention, broad (and often sketchy) in  its character depictions, and completely uninterested in its own  genericism, Disturbing Behavior is a conventional suspense-action piece.  It doesn't rely on gore effects and slasher-film conventions; for example,  one of the most disturbing scenes in Behavior is the scene of near-seducton  that ends in masochism -- its impact comes not from physical danger (as in  Scream and the slasher-film tradition) but from the concept.  Same for the  rest of the story -- the question is not whether these kids will get their  heads chopped off; it's whether they can retain their own identity.  And  that is NOTHING that the slasher-film tradition offers because, as shown by  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the forefather of all slashers, the slasher  film's chief weapon is simple, straight-forward physical danger.The look  of Disturbing Behavior is more noir than slasher, and its storyline is a  dead-serious social commentary.  Kind of like a much less complicated  version of 1984, and limited to young people instead of the whole  society.I actually liked Disturbing Behavior even if its faults are  legion -- Marsden's questionable acting, the lack of real depth of the  Katie Holmes character (though she tries for more), and a slipshod  narrative structure.  It's worth a look for writer Scott Rosenberg's bleak  view of the institution of education.Disturbing Behavior is no classic.  But to lump it in with Scream (admittedly, the marketing campaign for  Disturbing Behavior *did* try to cash in on the horror audience rejuvenated  by Scream) is convenient, shallow, and an act of ignorance as to how the  two movies respectively work.",3,"Unfairly maligned; slightly clumsy, not awful.",921715200,"03 18, 1999",1999,2586,"['Much', 'been', 'said', 'being', 'Scream', 'ripoff', 'Here', 'verdict', 'based', 'horror-film', 'experience', 'observation', 'technical', 'execution', 'Disturbing', 'Behavior', 'screenwriting', 'directing', 'cinematographic', 'points', 'view', 'Disturbing', 'Behavior', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'ANY', 'Scream', 'movies.Scream', 'Scream', '2', 'were', 'self-referential', 'commentaries', 'horror', 'genre', 'frankly', 'dare', 'say', 'not', 'very', 'effectively', 'using', 'conventions', 'slasher', 'films', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'value', 'Scream', 'movies', 'was', 'comedic', 'elements', 'wink-wink', 'nudge-nudge', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'slasher', 'films', 'well', 'impact', 'Scream', 'impact', 'strictly', 'personal', 'are', 'relationships', 'characters', 'anything', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'extension', 'approach', '.Disturbing', 'Behavior', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Sociological', 'impact', 'intention', 'broad', 'often', 'sketchy', 'character', 'depictions', 'completely', 'uninterested', 'own', 'genericism', 'Disturbing', 'Behavior', 'conventional', 'suspense-action', 'piece', ""n't"", 'rely', 'gore', 'effects', 'slasher-film', 'conventions', 'example', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'Behavior', 'scene', 'near-seducton', 'masochism', 'impact', 'not', 'physical', 'danger', 'Scream', 'slasher-film', 'tradition', 'concept', 'Same', 'rest', 'story', 'question', 'not', 'kids', 'will', 'get', 'heads', 'chopped', 'off', 'can', 'retain', 'own', 'identity', 'NOTHING', 'slasher-film', 'tradition', 'offers', 'because', 'shown', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'forefather', 'slashers', 'slasher', 'film', 'chief', 'weapon', 'simple', 'straight-forward', 'physical', 'danger.The', 'look', 'Disturbing', 'Behavior', 'more', 'noir', 'slasher', 'storyline', 'dead-serious', 'social', 'commentary', 'Kind', 'much', 'less', 'complicated', 'version', '1984', 'limited', 'young', 'people', 'instead', 'whole', 'society.I', 'actually', 'liked', 'Disturbing', 'Behavior', 'even', 'faults', 'are', 'legion', 'Marsden', 'questionable', 'acting', 'lack', 'real', 'depth', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'character', 'more', 'slipshod', 'narrative', 'structure', 'look', 'writer', 'Scott', 'Rosenberg', 'bleak', 'view', 'institution', 'education.Disturbing', 'Behavior', 'classic', 'lump', 'Scream', 'admittedly', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'Disturbing', 'Behavior', '*did*', 'try', 'cash', 'horror', 'audience', 'rejuvenated', 'Scream', 'convenient', 'shallow', 'act', 'ignorance', 'how', 'two', 'movies', 'respectively', 'work']",Disturbing Behavior VHS

145081,A2IY9M330NKBW6,0792840119,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", which spawned three sequels, is a great formula for a movie, and can be fitted to a number of socio-political situations. Too bad these guys screwed up the formula.Here's the scoop. Steve Clark (James Marsden) and his family are from Chicago. They move to Washington state to start a new life after Steve's brother committed suicide. Once there, Steve is befriended by Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl) who proceeds to give him the lay of the land as far as the high school is concerned. His big concern is that the more independent kids in the school are being turned into ""good"" kids by some procedure unknown. Of course Steve thinks he's paranoid but evidence begins to add up showing that Gavin might be right on.Where to begin. In the ""invasion"" movies and ""John Carpenter's the Thing"" the situations start out vague and the pieces begin to come together and form a whole. Then everybody signs on and works out a strategy to deal with it. Here, the viewer sees, in the opening scene, what's going on. So how is the paranoia machine supposed to ramp up? This is a fundamental screw-up in the script. So this then comes more down to details on how the kids are being turned. Who's doing it, and what are our heroes going to do about it. And what are they trying to say? Turn all kids good? Or, as the final scene suggests, is it an indictment on our trying to standardize learning throughout the U.S.? Then there's Nick Stahl's character Gavin. Yes, I guess he's a clever chap but his patter is a bit too clever. I liked it at first but it wore thin really quick. And what about Katie Holmes' character Rachel? She's not a troublemaker like the other targets but she's definitely left of center. They just didn't draw her very well and they didn't give her and Steve enough time to build up the sizzle. A big surprise was the William Sadler character Dorian. He was better than he had to be for this role.There are some good scenes here which kept me in the game.

145087,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,0792840119,Jason,"[2, 2]","Disturbing Behavior is essentially an American adaptation of the classic A Clockwork Orange.  Where juvenile delinquints were targeted before, now it's every kid who doesn't exude the perfect behavior.The movie begins with a teenage couple making out at an overlooking bluff.  When the girl gets a little too frisky, the young man tells her that he ""needs his fluids"".  When she doesn't follow his suggestion, his eyes glow slightly, and then he snaps her neck.  To make matters worse, the local police happen upon the scene, and at least one of the cops is complicit.  Unfortunately for them, this is all seen by a local kid named Gavin (Nick Stahl), who has an inexplicably verbose vocabulary for a high school student.Meanwhile, the perfect WASP family is moving into quiet Cradle Bay, a community where the most happening place is a Yogurt Shoppe, and the most exciting news is usually related to a bake sale somewhere.  Steve (James Marsden) is the clean-cut, go-getter, and like the rest of his family, he is recently mourning the loss of his older brother.  At his new school, however, he'll soon be mourning the fact that the social divide is far beyond most high schools; it's the ""Greasers"" versus the ""Soc'ias"", but to the Nth degree.  In the new school, as explained by Gavin and an albino friend nicknamed UV, it's ""Motorheads"", ""Microgeeks"", ""Skaters"", and ""Blue Ribbons"", a group of school do-gooders, who are just a little too perfect, a little too 1950s.Steve soon sees Rachel (Katie Holmes), a beautiful outcast who ridiculously insists on using the word ""razor"" as a slang term.  Katie Holmes may have never been better looking in a movie.  Soon enough he's distracted, however, by one of the Blue Ribbon kids going berzerk and beating two other high school kids, even ripping out a nose-ring, because his attraction to Rachel was too much to handle.  It seems that when Blue Ribbons have emotional or sexual attraction they're not quite up to Blue Ribbon standards.Within two days, Steve notices that one of the rougher students, who recently got in a fight with one of the Blue Ribbons, has suddenly become a straight-laced Blue Ribbon.  It's just a bit too odd for Steve, or anyone else's tastes.  He hears about Gavin's theory that the kids at school are being brainwashed and/or lobotomized by the school therapist Dr. Caldicott, and he meets Mr. Newberry, an insane janitor at the school.To prove his theories, Gavin sneaks into school with Steve one evening, and learns that Gavin's parents are planning on enrolling him into one of the weekend retreats that has helped, maybe even created, the rest of the Blue Ribbons.  What happens next shocks everyone.As a result, Steve and Rachel realize they must fight the rest of the school, the growing school conspiracy, the Blue Ribbons, and what seems like the entire town in order to find out what has been happening.  It's a race to not only save themselves, but also friends and family who may be affected.  Disturbing Behavior is a well-made adaptation, with great acting, and a few interesting twists to keep the viewers guessing.",4,"C'mon Ray Ray, give up the play for ol' Chuck!",1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,3107,"['Disturbing', 'Behavior', 'essentially', 'American', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Where', 'juvenile', 'delinquints', 'were', 'targeted', 'now', 'kid', 'who', ""n't"", 'exude', 'perfect', 'behavior.The', 'movie', 'teenage', 'couple', 'making', 'out', 'overlooking', 'bluff', 'When', 'girl', 'little', 'too', 'frisky', 'young', 'man', 'fluids', 'When', ""n't"", 'follow', 'suggestion', 'eyes', 'glow', 'slightly', 'then', 'neck', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'local', 'police', 'happen', 'scene', 'least', 'one', 'cops', 'complicit', 'Unfortunately', 'seen', 'local', 'kid', 'named', 'Gavin', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'verbose', 'vocabulary', 'high', 'school', 'student.Meanwhile', 'perfect', 'WASP', 'family', 'moving', 'quiet', 'Cradle', 'Bay', 'community', 'where', 'most', 'happening', 'place', 'Yogurt', 'Shoppe', 'most', 'exciting', 'news', 'usually', 'related', 'bake', 'sale', 'somewhere', 'Steve', 'James', 'Marsden', 'clean-cut', 'go-getter', 'rest', 'family', 'recently', 'mourning', 'loss', 'older', 'brother', 'new', 'school', 'however', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'be', 'mourning', 'fact', 'social', 'divide', 'far', 'most', 'high', 'schools', 'Greasers', ""Soc'ias"", 'Nth', 'degree', 'new', 'school', 'explained', 'Gavin', 'albino', 'friend', 'nicknamed', 'UV', 'Motorheads', 'Microgeeks', 'Skaters', 'Blue', 'Ribbons', 'group', 'school', 'do-gooders', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'little', 'too', '1950s.Steve', 'soon', 'sees', 'Rachel', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'beautiful', 'outcast', 'who', 'ridiculously', 'using', 'word', 'razor', 'slang', 'term', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'looking', 'movie', 'Soon', 'distracted', 'however', 'one', 'Blue', 'Ribbon', 'kids', 'going', 'berzerk', 'beating', 'two', 'other', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'even', 'ripping', 'out', 'nose-ring', 'attraction', 'Rachel', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'when', 'Blue', 'Ribbons', 'have', 'emotional', 'sexual', 'attraction', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'Blue', 'Ribbon', 'standards.Within', 'two', 'days', 'Steve', 'one', 'rougher', 'students', 'who', 'recently', 'got', 'fight', 'one', 'Blue', 'Ribbons', 'suddenly', 'become', 'straight-laced', 'Blue', 'Ribbon', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'odd', 'Steve', 'anyone', 'else', 'tastes', 'Gavin', 'theory', 'kids', 'school', 'are', 'being', 'brainwashed', 'lobotomized', 'school', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Caldicott', 'Mr.', 'Newberry', 'insane', 'janitor', 'school.To', 'prove', 'theories', 'Gavin', 'school', 'Steve', 'one', 'evening', 'Gavin', 'parents', 'are', 'planning', 'enrolling', 'one', 'weekend', 'helped', 'maybe', 'even', 'created', 'rest', 'Blue', 'Ribbons', 'What', 'next', 'shocks', 'everyone.As', 'result', 'Steve', 'Rachel', 'realize', 'must', 'fight', 'rest', 'school', 'growing', 'school', 'conspiracy', 'Blue', 'Ribbons', 'what', 'entire', 'town', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'been', 'happening', 'race', 'not', 'only', 'save', 'also', 'friends', 'family', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'affected', 'Disturbing', 'Behavior', 'well-made', 'adaptation', 'great', 'acting', 'few', 'interesting', 'twists', 'keep', 'viewers', 'guessing']",Disturbing Behavior VHS
145088,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0792840119,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 6]","High School! Yay! If you're like me, you loathe the very mention of ""High School"". The principal in charge of my school ran the place like a prison. No pop machines. No soft drinks or candy allowed. Need to use the bathroom? Tough. Go when you're walking to your next class. I won't even get into the fact that when I turned eighteen at the beginning of my last year I could legally smoke cigarettes yet for some reason wasn't allowed to even OUTSIDE of the building without receiving some sort of punishment. Of course, after the warden moved on a few years later, the kids there had pop machines, candy machines, and could leave for lunch whenever they felt like it. I'm not bitter about it, really. It's so far in the past that I laugh about my experiences there whenever anyone mentions high school. Which, fortunately, isn't often. My encounters with high school these days largely come to me through movies. It looks like kids today have to go through the same crud I endured years ago. I feel for them. My advice to these poor souls: gut it out. Life gets much, much better in a few years.None of this nonsense has much to do about anything except to serve as a rather lame introduction to my review of David Nutter's 1998 film ""Disturbing Behavior"". The movie introduces us to Steve Clark (James Marsden), a young man moving into the small town of Cradle Bay and trying to navigate his way through the social hell that is high school. He quickly meets up with two important characters: Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl) and Rachel Wagner (Katie Holmes). These two kids definitely look the part of outsiders. Strick mumbles a lot and has that old soul look, and Wagner dresses in black and sulks all over the place. Still, the two provide our hero with plenty of information about the various goings on in Cradle Bay High School. In one scene early on in the movie, Strick sits with Clark in the cafeteria and provides a quick run down of the various social cliques. The stoners, car lovers, nerds...you get the idea, except he has different names for them. Gavin makes sure to point out one group in particular, a collection of neatly groomed youngsters he calls ""Blue Ribbons"". They're the upright, popular kids who also excel in school.But something is horribly, terribly wrong with the members of the Blue Ribbon gang. Let's call them a cult, actually. As Steve Clark soon learns, the town fell under the sway of one Dr. Edgar Endicott (Bruce Greenwood). He developed a plan, a behavior modification plan, that promises to transform troubled kids into straight arrows. Sounds great, doesn't it? Most of the parents in Cradle Bay think so. The Blue Ribbon cult keeps getting bigger and bigger as more kids fall into the orbit of Endicott's program. There's just one LITTLE problem with the new in crowd. The members have a tendency to erupt into cyclones of violence at the drop of the hat, usually when something excites those darn teenage hormones. Witness the carnage that takes place in a supermarket in one scene, and I think you'll agree that something isn't right here. Clark launches an investigation, spurred on by Gavin's sudden conversion into a Blue Ribboner, and what he finds isn't pretty. Endicott, with the help of Officer Cox (Steve Railsback), is performing bizarre experiments in the field of neurology. I think it's safe to say that brain surgery, behavior modification, and raging hormones lead to one heck of a conclusion.""Disturbing Behavior"" is a lot of fun. The movie achieves heights of ridiculousness, especially during the grand finale, but that didn't stop me from grabbing on to this sucker's horns and riding it until the gruesome end. Let's run over the positives real quick. One, Katie Holmes. She's smoking hot in this film. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for her, but she attains heights of foxiness here I never imagined. Simply gorgeous. It's painful to think she's glued to Mr. Xenu in real life. Two, Nick Stahl is a really good actor. He can take something as goofy as ""Disturbing Behavior"" and sell it to the audience. Third, what's up with Hollywood and janitors? Between the guy in ""The Breakfast Club"" and the janitor here that lends a helping hand to Steve and his buddies, Dorien Newberry (William Sadler), it's obvious Tinseltown has a love affair with those pursuing a career in the custodial arts (a nod to Bender there). Four, and finally, it's nice to see Ethan Embry and Katharine Isabelle in small supporting roles. Now let's peruse the negatives. There aren't any, really, unless you count the film's short runtime. ""Disturbing Behavior"" clocks in at a paltry eighty-four minutes, including credits. Ouch!The ""Disturbing Behavior"" DVD contains mucho supplements. We get a music video from The Flys, a commentary track featuring director David Nutter, an alternate ending, and eleven deleted scenes. That's a lot of deleted scenes! They should've just plugged them back into the movie to up the runtime. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie immensely. I remember when it came out back in the late 1990s, and I remember it tanking fast, so I put off seeing it until now thinking that it must have really stunk. The returns were so low that David Nutter has done nothing but television work since the film came out. Well, the critics and theater audiences were wrong; it's a great, entertaining horror flick filled with violence and heavy-handed messages about social conformity. In other words, it's high school with Katie Holmes. By the way, did I mention Katie Holmes is smoking hot? Good. I give this movie five stars. I give Katie ten stars.

After watching this  movie, this convinces me that if I ever commit some horrible crime, that I  should get Katie Holmes or James Marsden to defend me.The review...  this tries treading Stepford Wives/Lottery ground by being a chilling  picture of conformity &amp; savagery.  It attempts to be scary, but seems  to rely a lot on this camera trick where eyes glow neon red.  It reminds me  of a sports drink commercial.  So if this kind of thing scares you, then  this also might.Characters are badly written.  The janitor's supposed to  be a genius feigning retardation in order to study people closely, but he  seems to be inserted into the movie like a fish into a sandbox...you don't  rightly understand why he's there, but someone put him there for a reason.  Basically, he makes 'plot' advance &amp; it's his only reason for being in  film.Katie Holmes may not be the greatest thespian, but I couldn't rid  myself of the idea that all her 'bad girl 'tude' had more to do with a  contempt for herself for appearing in this film.  Really.  Contempt seemed  to ooze out of my tv screen and I almost got up to wipe it got so bad.  She  was either working so hard on getting this 'emotional tone' right or  betrayed that she, like the rest of us, had a cable bill to pay and this  lousy job would cover it.The box cover betrays that this movie is  basically a series of situations that attractive people get into.  If  you're shopping for narrative, shop elsewhere.  If you want situations for  the sake of situations and shot without a lot of regard to logic, then  watch this movie.Audio of poor quality and made dialogue hard to hear,  but considering the quality of what I DID hear, I didn't bother  rewinding.Oh, someone quotes a Pink Floyd song in an odd moment &amp;  this is good because it is unintentionally funny.James Marsden's &amp;  Katie Holmes' character don't seem to have much reason for falling in love  or whatever beyond the fact that they both have good cheekbones.Oh, and  the outdoor shots showed a very beautiful woodland area.k",1,Random Movie begets Random Review!,962236800,"06 29, 2000",2000,2177,"['Having', 'examined', 'other', 'reviews', 'site', 'can', 'only', 'explain', 'result', 'voting', 'attractive', 'people', 'watching', 'movie', 'convinces', 'ever', 'commit', 'horrible', 'crime', 'should', 'get', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'James', 'Marsden', 'defend', 'me.The', 'review', 'treading', 'Stepford', 'Wives/Lottery', 'ground', 'being', 'chilling', 'picture', 'conformity', 'amp', 'savagery', 'be', 'scary', 'rely', 'lot', 'camera', 'trick', 'where', 'eyes', 'glow', 'neon', 'red', 'sports', 'drink', 'commercial', 'So', 'kind', 'thing', 'scares', 'then', 'also', 'might.Characters', 'are', 'badly', 'written', 'janitor', 'supposed', 'be', 'genius', 'feigning', 'retardation', 'order', 'study', 'people', 'closely', 'be', 'inserted', 'movie', 'fish', 'sandbox', 'do', ""n't"", 'rightly', 'understand', 'why', 'there', 'someone', 'put', 'there', 'reason', 'Basically', 'advance', 'amp', 'only', 'reason', 'being', 'film.Katie', 'Holmes', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'thespian', 'could', ""n't"", 'rid', 'idea', ""'bad"", 'girl', ""'tude"", 'had', 'more', 'do', 'contempt', 'herself', 'appearing', 'film', 'Really', 'Contempt', 'seemed', 'ooze', 'tv', 'screen', 'almost', 'got', 'up', 'wipe', 'got', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'either', 'working', 'so', 'hard', 'getting', ""'emotional"", 'tone', 'right', 'betrayed', 'rest', 'had', 'cable', 'bill', 'pay', 'lousy', 'job', 'would', 'cover', 'it.The', 'box', 'cover', 'movie', 'basically', 'series', 'situations', 'attractive', 'people', 'get', ""'re"", 'shopping', 'narrative', 'shop', 'elsewhere', 'want', 'situations', 'sake', 'situations', 'shot', 'lot', 'regard', 'logic', 'then', 'watch', 'movie.Audio', 'poor', 'quality', 'made', 'dialogue', 'hard', 'hear', 'considering', 'quality', 'what', 'DID', 'hear', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'rewinding.Oh', 'someone', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'song', 'odd', 'moment', 'amp', 'good', 'unintentionally', 'funny.James', 'Marsden', 'amp', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'reason', 'falling', 'love', 'fact', 'have', 'good', 'cheekbones.Oh', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'showed', 'very', 'beautiful', 'woodland', 'area.k']",Disturbing Behavior VHS

Originality is then suspended until the end credits.The story begins late one night when true GenXer Gavin, played for reasons unknown by the brilliant young actor Nick Stahl, witnesses a bizarre double murder. The next time we see him is at school, where he seems a bit paranoid but has told no one what he has witnessed. We assume there must be some good reason why he has remained silent, but as the movie goes one, we discover that the script doesn't supply one. In fact, it provides few reasons why anything happens.James Marsden, an actor who should either pick better parts or return to TV, plays Jimmy, whose family moves to a lush island off the coast of Washington after his brother commits suicide. Why? Who knows? Off he goes to the local school where something or someone is turning troubled, rebellious students into picture perfect middle American kids. Naturally, as in all mad scientist movie stories, they are not perfect at all.Jimmy meets Rachel, the girl whose destined to become his prerequisite babe. Kate Holmes has a tough time with this role. Anyone would, because Rachel's personality switches towards the end of the movie. This is due to the dreadfully written script, not to science gone mad...It is possible that, if Disturbing Behavior had been satire of today's fears and preoccupation, it may have been a lot better. A magic potion for turning our kids into a group sharing the same uptight values would appeal to the growing ultra right wing segment of the adult population. It would be a typically simplistic answer to a complex issue.

His family moves him to Cradle Bay, where a group of students called &quot;The Blue Ribbons&quot; epitomize the perfect teen---they hang out in a yogurt shoppe, for instance!

The high school students in a small town are changing from druggies and slackers into picture-perfect, and parent-perfect, model students (called Blue Ribbons), and no one in town seems to mind.  The problem is, the students didn't do it willingly; their parents signed them up for a program that alters their minds.  When a new student finds that one of his friends has been changed into a Blue Ribbon, he decides to do something about it.  You find yourself rooting on the misfits and booing the jocks.  An excellent supporting cast surrounds James Mardson, who does a wonderful job of winning the fight and winning the girl at the same time; the girl being Katie Holmes, one of the most talented actors of her generation, who manages to knock out the school football champion.",5,Better than you think,993427200,"06 25, 2001",2001,1088,"['movie', 'one', 'definately', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'can', 'handle', 'living', 'what', 'want', 'not', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'way', 'will', 'send', 'chills', 'up', 'spine', 'gory', 'scenes', 'few', 'shocks', 'hospital', 'add', 'feeling', 'creepiness', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'changing', 'druggies', 'slackers', 'picture-perfect', 'parent-perfect', 'model', 'students', 'called', 'Blue', 'Ribbons', 'one', 'town', 'mind', 'problem', 'students', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'willingly', 'parents', 'signed', 'up', 'program', 'minds', 'When', 'new', 'student', 'one', 'friends', 'been', 'changed', 'Blue', 'Ribbon', 'do', 'something', 'find', 'rooting', 'misfits', 'booing', 'jocks', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'surrounds', 'James', 'Mardson', 'who', 'wonderful', 'job', 'winning', 'fight', 'winning', 'girl', 'same', 'time', 'girl', 'being', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'generation', 'who', 'knock', 'out', 'school', 'football', 'champion']",Disturbing Behavior VHS

When you watch the film it's like seeing a tv-movie  not a like a movie for screen. Most annoying is the score by Mark Snow,  there are very few moments in the movie without music and that annoys. Mark  Snows music for X-Files was great, his score for Disturbing Behavior is  aweful. The movie isn't very scary at all, the only scene that was scary is  the one when James Marsden and Katie Holmes are in the psychatry.

Consequently, what begins as an intriguing story with some interesting characters rapidly evaporates into a disjointed mess, ultimately leaving too many characters undeveloped and too many questions unresolved. Why does Officer Cox seem to be protecting the evil kiddies? How does the janitor know what's really going on? Why is he pretending to be crazy? And what really happened to Stevie-boy's older brother, Allen? Are we even supposed to care? It's just all too conveniently, hurriedly, and rather clumsily, concluded. This is a pity, because if they'd run this film to 100 minutes, more of what I'm guessing was in the original screenplay might have been included. (The deleted scenes included on the DVD add a little back, but it's still not enough.) James Marsden and Katie Holmes acquit themselves well enough as Steve and Rachel, both looking appropriately bewildered at the nonsensical plot developments and their remarkably baseless and asexual romance. Both deserve better material than this. I'm sure Scott Rosenberg's original screenplay gave it to them, so I'm guessing the fault here lies with the producers. What were they thinking? That you can exhibit an 80 minute film SIX times per day rather than FIVE? Who knows. With the obligatory double-ending, though, one thing I'm sure they were thinking about is a sequel.

145113,A15OJWNE8J3WQS,0792840119,Taylor Sapp,"[6, 7]","DISTURBING BEHAVIOR by itself was a decent, slighly above average film that was marketed as teen horror, when it really is fueled by the same kind of paranoia that director David Nutter worked with on &quot;The X-File's&quot;. Seeing it in the theatres, I was surprised by how little it relied on scares, and instead was a more plot-driven quirky sci-fi film. The big problem, however, was the lack of development for many of the character's (particularly William Sadler as the &quot;more-than-who-he-seems&quot; janitor). Therefore, the film was fun and original, but also nonsenical and abrupt. Well, thank god for DVD. DISTURBING BEHAVIOR ranks right with BRAZIL in my opinion as a film the studio did the best they could to commercialize and destroy it (in BRAZIL's case the director won). On DVD, eleven deleted scenes, all with optional commentary by David Nutter can be viewed, and every single one of them adds a great deal to the film. While the great tragedy of the package is that you can't view the film with all this footage added, watching each cut scene seperately reveals a great amount of debt that this film (originally) had. The best of these scenes is definitely an extended meeting between Sadler's janitor and the James Marsden character. In the film itself, this brief meeting shows that the janitor might be more than he seems, but is so brief as to be completely confusing. With the added footage, Sadler brings great poignancy to his character, gives some extremely valuable information on the beginning of the changes in the town, and delivers the (would be) film's best line: &quot;This town sucks for heroes; you looking to be the first?&quot; It's a tragedy that this scene was cut, and you can practically hear David Nutter weep over losing each one of these scenes. The alternate, much darker ending on the boat completely changes the tone of the film and adds a great sadness in its scope, which in my opinion could have gave the film the potential to at least be a solid piece of work, rather than a so-so hackjob.  Anyone truly interested in film and its development should consider this film essential (regardless of whether you actually like DISTURING BEHAVIOR or not). An example of how studios can ruin movies, watching this alongside the criterion DVD of BRAZIL shows the difference between what happens when the director wins, and what happens when the studio does. DISTURBING BEHAVIOR could have been, at the least, a good film, but it instead a curiosity. I only wish that one day they re-release this film WITH the added scenes (directors cut anyone?), because I have a feeling that we might have a cult favorite on our hands.",4,Decent Movie-Essential DVD,980121600,"01 22, 2001",2001,2670,"['DISTURBING', 'BEHAVIOR', 'was', 'decent', 'slighly', 'average', 'film', 'was', 'marketed', 'teen', 'horror', 'when', 'really', 'fueled', 'same', 'kind', 'paranoia', 'director', 'David', 'Nutter', 'worked', 'quot', 'X-File', 'quot', 'Seeing', 'theatres', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'little', 'relied', 'scares', 'instead', 'was', 'more', 'plot-driven', 'quirky', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'big', 'problem', 'however', 'was', 'lack', 'development', 'many', 'character', 'particularly', 'William', 'Sadler', 'quot', 'more-than-who-he-seems', 'quot', 'janitor', 'Therefore', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'original', 'also', 'nonsenical', 'abrupt', 'Well', 'thank', 'god', 'DVD', 'DISTURBING', 'BEHAVIOR', 'ranks', 'right', 'BRAZIL', 'opinion', 'film', 'studio', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'commercialize', 'destroy', 'BRAZIL', 'case', 'director', 'won', 'DVD', 'eleven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'David', 'Nutter', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'single', 'one', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'great', 'tragedy', 'package', 'ca', ""n't"", 'view', 'film', 'footage', 'added', 'watching', 'cut', 'scene', 'seperately', 'great', 'amount', 'debt', 'film', 'originally', 'had', 'best', 'scenes', 'definitely', 'extended', 'meeting', 'Sadler', 'janitor', 'James', 'Marsden', 'character', 'film', 'brief', 'meeting', 'shows', 'janitor', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'so', 'brief', 'be', 'completely', 'confusing', 'added', 'footage', 'Sadler', 'great', 'poignancy', 'character', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'information', 'beginning', 'changes', 'town', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'best', 'line', 'quot', 'town', 'heroes', 'looking', 'be', 'first', 'quot', 'tragedy', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'can', 'practically', 'hear', 'David', 'Nutter', 'weep', 'losing', 'one', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'much', 'darker', 'ending', 'boat', 'completely', 'tone', 'film', 'great', 'sadness', 'scope', 'opinion', 'could', 'have', 'gave', 'film', 'potential', 'least', 'be', 'solid', 'piece', 'work', 'rather', 'so-so', 'hackjob', 'Anyone', 'truly', 'interested', 'film', 'development', 'should', 'consider', 'film', 'essential', 'regardless', 'actually', 'DISTURING', 'BEHAVIOR', 'not', 'example', 'how', 'studios', 'can', 'ruin', 'movies', 'watching', 'criterion', 'DVD', 'BRAZIL', 'difference', 'what', 'when', 'director', 'what', 'when', 'studio', 'DISTURBING', 'BEHAVIOR', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'good', 'film', 'instead', 'curiosity', 'only', 'wish', 'one', 'day', 're-release', 'film', 'WITH', 'added', 'scenes', 'directors', 'cut', 'anyone', 'have', 'feeling', 'might', 'have', 'cult', 'favorite', 'hands']",Disturbing Behavior VHS
