Burchfield,"[1, 2]","I loved the animation, sometimes it was so realistic you could even see the pores in the character's skin, although occaisionally the people seemed to move somewhat awkwardly.

542605,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00003CY5C,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[4, 4]","It's a shame that this film didn't do as well as it should have. It didn't do very well in terms of critical response (44% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and a 49 out of 100 on Metacritic), it was a box office bomb to the point of where Square Enix kicked the film's director and producer Hironobu Sakaguchi (The creator of the Final Fantasy game franchise) to the curb, and some people have been popping up who proclaim it to be ""the worst video game movie ever!"" Surprisingly, one of the biggest defenders of the film was film critic Roger Ebert who I hate greatly for a number of reasons. Roger Ebert handed the film a 3.5 out of 4-star rating and didn't believe people would understand the film. I believe Square Enix reacted a little too quickly to fire the creator of Final Fantasy, which I believe was a big mistake. And to those of you who think this is the worst video game film ever, clearly you've never sat through an Uwe Boll travesty, have you? Not to mention, most scores on different sites that I've researched, beg to differ on such a proclamation. I loved this film, it was an amazing cinematic accomplishment in terms of CGI and sci-fi action films. It may not have the most original storyline, but it does pull you in to a certain extent.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Year: 2065, thirty-four years previously, a mysterious alien forced called Phantoms invaded the Earth and destroyed most of the life on Earth by stealing the spirits of their victims. Now the planet is overrun with the Phantoms. Dr. Aki Ross is a woman struggling with a Phantom parasite inside of her body and suffers from strange dreams she cannot explain. She goes around the planet trying to find eight spirits which, when all eight are collected, will destroy the Phantoms. With the help of the Deep Eyes Squadron and her mentor, Dr. Sid they search the planet to find the seventh and the most important eight spirit. But they face troubles with the military, and the military unknowingly is about to destroy Gaia (Earth's spirit) and let the planet become overrun with the Phantoms. Now Aki and the team must stop this from happening and destroy the Phantoms at their source.MUSIC: This music is simply amazing. It fit the mood well and was extremely well-written and composed. I have absolutely no gripes with this area at all, the music is stunning to put it bluntly.ACTION: This film a feast for the eye. The CGI is staggering and beautiful in every way... and this film came out eight years ago! Nothing competes with this film's CGI, not even Pixar films! The action scenes are wonderful and totally awesome in every regard. The film starts off slow, but then the film goes off with a bang and doesn't stop till the end. It gets the blood and adrenaline pumping and refuses to let go. This is how a Star Wars animated flick should be, not the disastrousStar Wars: The Clone Wars (Widescreen Edition)(Let's just try and pretend that never happened). Quite simply, this sci-fi flick is kickass.ACTING: Although not all these actors are recognizable, their performances are really good, even though there are some moments of questionable dialogue. This film may not have the most compelling characters, but they do their job well and they do move the storyline along quite well. Overall, this area is really good.OVERALL: If you love sci-fi flicks, CGI films, or just love awesome films in general, you must see this film because it will blow you away in just about every way.THE GOOD: Stunning CGI animation, awesome action scenes, good acting, and great music.THE BAD: The storyline doesn't quite live up to the potential and there are moments of awkward dialogue.",5,MAGNIFICENT AND BREATH-TAKING  9.5 OUT OF 10,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,3643,"['shame', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'terms', 'critical', 'response', '44', '%', 'Fresh', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', '49', '100', 'Metacritic', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'point', 'where', 'Square', 'Enix', 'kicked', 'film', 'director', 'producer', 'Hironobu', 'Sakaguchi', 'creator', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'game', 'franchise', 'curb', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'popping', 'up', 'who', 'proclaim', 'be', 'worst', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'ever', 'Surprisingly', 'one', 'biggest', 'defenders', 'film', 'was', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'who', 'hate', 'greatly', 'number', 'reasons', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'handed', 'film', '3.5', '4-star', 'rating', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'would', 'understand', 'film', 'believe', 'Square', 'Enix', 'reacted', 'little', 'too', 'quickly', 'fire', 'creator', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'believe', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'who', 'think', 'worst', 'video', 'game', 'film', 'ever', 'clearly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'sat', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'travesty', 'have', 'Not', 'mention', 'most', 'scores', 'different', 'sites', ""'ve"", 'researched', 'beg', 'differ', 'proclamation', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'amazing', 'cinematic', 'accomplishment', 'terms', 'CGI', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'most', 'original', 'storyline', 'pull', 'certain', 'extent.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Year', '2065', 'thirty-four', 'years', 'previously', 'mysterious', 'alien', 'forced', 'called', 'Phantoms', 'invaded', 'Earth', 'destroyed', 'most', 'life', 'Earth', 'stealing', 'spirits', 'victims', 'Now', 'planet', 'overrun', 'Phantoms', 'Dr.', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'woman', 'struggling', 'Phantom', 'parasite', 'inside', 'body', 'suffers', 'strange', 'dreams', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'planet', 'trying', 'find', 'eight', 'spirits', 'when', 'eight', 'are', 'collected', 'will', 'destroy', 'Phantoms', 'help', 'Deep', 'Eyes', 'Squadron', 'mentor', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'search', 'planet', 'find', 'seventh', 'most', 'important', 'eight', 'spirit', 'face', 'troubles', 'military', 'military', 'unknowingly', 'destroy', 'Gaia', 'Earth', 'spirit', 'let', 'planet', 'become', 'overrun', 'Phantoms', 'Now', 'Aki', 'team', 'must', 'stop', 'happening', 'destroy', 'Phantoms', 'source.MUSIC', 'music', 'simply', 'amazing', 'fit', 'mood', 'well', 'was', 'extremely', 'well-written', 'composed', 'have', 'absolutely', 'gripes', 'area', 'music', 'stunning', 'put', 'bluntly.ACTION', 'film', 'feast', 'eye', 'CGI', 'staggering', 'beautiful', 'way', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'Nothing', 'film', 'CGI', 'not', 'even', 'Pixar', 'films', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'totally', 'awesome', 'regard', 'film', 'slow', 'then', 'film', 'bang', ""n't"", 'stop', 'till', 'end', 'blood', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'let', 'go', 'how', 'Star', 'Wars', 'animated', 'flick', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'disastrousStar', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Let', 'just', 'try', 'pretend', 'never', 'happened', 'Quite', 'simply', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'kickass.ACTING', 'not', 'actors', 'are', 'recognizable', 'performances', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'even', 'are', 'moments', 'questionable', 'dialogue', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'most', 'compelling', 'characters', 'do', 'job', 'well', 'do', 'move', 'storyline', 'quite', 'well', 'Overall', 'area', 'really', 'good.OVERALL', 'love', 'sci-fi', 'flicks', 'CGI', 'films', 'just', 'love', 'awesome', 'films', 'general', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'just', 'way.THE', 'GOOD', 'Stunning', 'CGI', 'animation', 'awesome', 'action', 'scenes', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'music.THE', 'BAD', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'are', 'moments', 'awkward', 'dialogue']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

542607,A18BD98SU49UB7,B00003CY5C,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[6, 8]","On release, Final Fantasy remained in the top spot for two days. On it's third day it was overtaken by Legally Blonde and The Score, placing it in third place within the box office scene. On it's 12th day, Fantasy was buried under a pile led by Jurassic Park 3 and America's Sweetheart's that were competing to rake in the cash. Also at the time in full throttle: Shrek, Tomb Raider, Scary Movie 2, Dr Doolitle 2, Cat's and Dog's, and even A.I. Soon after Planet of the Apes appeared, and Final Fantasy was no more.In short, Final Fantasy has become Hollywood's newest victim to bad timing.Many things have been said lightly, and thrown harshly at Final Fantasy: the spirit's within, but when something is done so well, there is no room for bashing. Computer Rendering has never been so breathtaking and rarely am I this pleased with how much work was put into a film, nor appreciated it more.The story, I must admit, does have &quot;the&quot; good versus evil story line that is used in most every film...including Star Wars. Here's a blow, take a look at the highest grossing and most loved films and you will see that they all have that story line. It's in our religeon's, it's in our history, it's in our movies, it's in our blood: Go figure. Also there is complaint of the dialogue between character's being to simple and &quot;everyday&quot;. Who would of thought that people speak in simple, every day term's. Heaven forbid we say, &quot;Will I save the Earth before it's too late? I don't know how much time I have left.&quot;Aki is driven by her dreams and a rapidly growing, cancer-like, phantom host that lives within her. As I do not personally believe in the religeon used in the film (i.e. Fantasy), I compared it to my own belief's and was astounded with the similarities. How refreshing to see something that has belief in itself.Also, another thing I liked is how (even though people complain about the rest of the film) the ending retreat's from Hollywood's simple minded closures. There is no happy ending here my friends, rather a hope for something better.This is the best looking dvd in my growing collection. The sound is wonderful and alive, though I would have liked a dts track. No complaint's mainly because the 5.1 digital track does everything it is supposed to. Final fantasy is flat out reference material.When you have your friend's or family over and have just finished your no-bake cheese cake, your going to want to whip out the old dvd remote and show off your system. (That's the way I am, I don't know about you). Usually for sound you would pop in Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan, or The Matrix to show your speakers off. For picture you would get out Unbreakable, again the Matrix, or even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. No more my friend, because now you have a 2 disc'er that will do more than tickle their senses.As far as extra's, you can't...Can Not!...get much better. At least to date. Though Snow White is close and Ep. 1 a tie, you will be entertained by Final Fantasy's storage of fact's and fiction's. If your an average film nut like me, your knowledge will be tripled and your respect for the film maker's will be beyond word's.Some advice, do not check out the features before watching the film. The extra's take you nearly frame by frame in the creative process, and could spoil the fun!Very imaginative and extremely fine tuned film (dvd) that I and my family truly enjoyed.

542608,A39PGE3IDI0VY6,B00003CY5C,"A. KAPLAN ""Penelopecat""","[3, 3]","On its release, Final Fantasy garnered mostly negative reviews for its story, but almost everyone agreed that this was a beautiful movie.  Having finally had a chance to judge for myself, I believe the critics were overly harsh.  The story is fairly straightforward and uncomplicated, but by no means stupid.  I found myself drawn in to the mystery of the phantom invasion, and appreciated the message that sometimes there are better ways to solve a problem than by simply blasting away at it.  I would have appreciated more character background detail, but at least each one was given a distinctive personality.And, as advertised, this is a gorgeous film.  While the level of detail on the characters isn't so far advanced that you become convinced they're human, the expressiveness of the faces and body language are mind-blowing.  The characters convey the same levels of warmth and life as those in Toy Story or Monsters Inc, but without the exagerated features.  The production has such depth you forget they're just computer images, and sit back and get caught up in the action.I also appreciated the wealth of extra features on this DVD.  Let's face it, with a movie like this, there's more to wonder about how they did it, and the various commentary tracks and making-of features should satisfy all but the most demanding of fans.  But no matter how great the extra features are, they only matter if the movie is worth watching.

542613,AO1TOG5CBJW9I,B00003CY5C,Alucard,"[4, 10]","Squaresoft has truly sold out this time. This abomination of a motion picture is so terrible, it's unbelieved. I love the Final Fantasy video games, each game is rich in storyline and character development. This movie however, is an absolute insult to the series. Fans looking for a movie that would do justice to their beloved seires will not find it here. This is just another way to milk more money out of the FF series. It's insulting to the game's fans, and Sqaure themselves. Their picture company is going out of buisness too, guess you know why.......Basically, this film screams eye candy. The graphic animation is gorgeous, I'll admit that. Still, this is only the shell to an empty, hollow inside. This film's beauty is only on the outside. Once you look deeper, you'll find a truly depressing experiance. This is a nothing more than a cheezy sci-fi flick no better than any other. The only reason it has any appeal at all is due to it's graphic animation. If it was not animated, and real people were playing, then no one would care.The film's storyline is more confusing than FF8's junction system. You meet useless characters, barely any plot twists, and an overlong experiance that will make you want to play frisbee with this dvd. Aside from the graphics, there's no redeeming value whatsoever, it's a long, painful experiance.The diolouge is awful, with no emotion whatsoever. After playing games like FF7 and FF9, you really feel for the characters. Here, I honestly couldn't care what happened to these undeveloped characters. They are all boring and bland.So, if this film wasn't animated, no one would care about it. It's only selling well do to that.

Aki Ross (Ming-Na) must find eight earth-bound spirits to bring harmony and save the universe. She retrieves one from a plant,another from a dying girl (a slightly disturbing scene) She has visions sent to her from the Phantoms. With the help of her former lover, Capt. Edwards (Alec Baldwin),as well as her mentor, Dr. Sid, she goes on a vision quest. In the meantime, evil Gen. Hein wants to battle the Phantoms with the Zeus cannon, even if it destroys all humanity in the process. Aki constantly speaks of Gaia,the life-force. It's a fantasy film James Lovelock would enjoy. In the end, Aki realizes she carries the 8th spirit within her,and Edwards sacrifices himself as a channel so her life-force can go out.

My best friend was a huge fan of the video game series, and he integrated me into the obsession.  I went to see the film mostly for him.  He, being so devoted to the actual video games themselves, was disappointed in the vast difference in subject presented in the film.  It had varying similarities to the tone and texture of the video games, but it was wholly its own story and concept.  I was kind of in love with it, and I must admit that it has continued to grow on me over the years.  The film, while deeply rooted in the science fiction aspect of things, gets the bulk of its staying power from the very raw and human core of the film.  It contains the same level of character development that is so engrossing within the video games (that span hours of gameplay in order to truly connect you to the characters) but in a shorter time span and with slightly more intimate appeal.  The visual effects are stunning, and the action sequences come with a sharpness that elevates them above the bulk of animated films out there.  While the plot may seem rather straightforward, it isn't.  The core themes (which revolve mostly around the spiritual) make themselves known with a beautiful subtlety that gives the audience more reason to dive in for another viewing.

542625,A1AR8HYZ17T5H7,B00003CY5C,"""arxane""","[7, 7]","&quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; is the kind of movie that people with either love or hate. It is also considered as a testament to the idea that some films only belong on DVD and not in movie theaters. But while opinions are very mixed about this film, I really enjoyed it, despite its obvious flaws.The most noticable aspect of &quot;Spirits Within&quot; would undoubtedly be its graphics, and it's probably what this film will be remembered for. The visuals are amazing and stunning, and the characters are absolutely gorgeous, although they do sometimes move a little unnaturally. It was reported that the designers created Aki last so they could use all their experience on her, and it really shows. As Dash of TechTV said, &quot;she's worth every megabyte.&quot;Speaking of characters, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game veterans might notice that some of the characters resemble characters from the games. Aki somewhat resembles Rinoa from &quot;FFVIII&quot;, General Hein looks eerily like Seifer from &quot;FFVIII&quot;, and the black soldier could be a double for Barret from &quot;FFVII&quot;. But that's just me...The story is where the trouble starts. Many have complained that the plot is cliched, stale, and unoriginal, but that's not how I feel about it. While I must admit the story isn't terribly original, it's still an interesting story. It is a little confusing at first, especially at the end, but if you pay attention you will understand it. Some people have also complained that the movie has nothing to do with the games, but I disagree. The movie isn't based upon a particular &quot;FF&quot; game, but it does contain a key element: the Gaia. One of the binding links between all the &quot;FF&quot; games is a unifying force or power that holds the world together, and it's this element that makes sure &quot;Spirits Within&quot; isn't using the &quot;FF&quot; name as a crutch.The voice acting is another trouble spot. I will admit that Ming-na (Aki) sometimes faltered into a bland and forced mode of acting, as did Donald Sutherland (Doctor Sid), which made me cringe occasionally. But I will also say that James Woods gave an almost solid performance as General Heim and made him my favorite character of the movie. The rest of the voice actors were so-so, alternating between good and not-so-good. All in all, the voice-acting wasn't terrible, but they definately could've improved it. One minor note: occasionally, the voices did speak out of synch with the lips. It doesn't degrade the movie at all, but you can't help but notice it.To put it simply, &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; isn't for everyone. Some people love simplistic and occasionally cliched sci-fi storylines, while others loathe them and want something original. While this movie does break new ground for computer graphics, it unfortunately falls short in terms of execution. I can't reccommend it to anyone because the appeal of this movie is very difficult to pin down; you will just have to see it for yourself.",4,"Though not without flaws, it's still a good film.",1008115200,"12 12, 2001",2001,3037,"['quot', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'quot', 'kind', 'movie', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'also', 'considered', 'testament', 'idea', 'films', 'only', 'belong', 'DVD', 'not', 'movie', 'theaters', 'opinions', 'are', 'very', 'mixed', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'obvious', 'flaws.The', 'most', 'noticable', 'aspect', 'quot', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'quot', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'graphics', 'probably', 'what', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'visuals', 'are', 'amazing', 'stunning', 'characters', 'are', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'do', 'sometimes', 'move', 'little', 'unnaturally', 'was', 'reported', 'designers', 'created', 'Aki', 'last', 'could', 'use', 'experience', 'really', 'Dash', 'TechTV', 'said', 'quot', 'worth', 'megabyte.', 'quot', 'Speaking', 'characters', 'quot', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'quot', 'game', 'veterans', 'might', 'notice', 'characters', 'resemble', 'characters', 'games', 'Aki', 'somewhat', 'Rinoa', 'quot', 'FFVIII', 'quot', 'General', 'Hein', 'eerily', 'like', 'Seifer', 'quot', 'FFVIII', 'quot', 'black', 'soldier', 'could', 'be', 'double', 'Barret', 'quot', 'FFVII', 'quot', 'just', 'story', 'where', 'trouble', 'Many', 'have', 'complained', 'plot', 'cliched', 'stale', 'unoriginal', 'not', 'how', 'feel', 'must', 'admit', 'story', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'original', 'still', 'interesting', 'story', 'little', 'confusing', 'first', 'especially', 'end', 'pay', 'attention', 'will', 'understand', 'people', 'have', 'also', 'complained', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'games', 'disagree', 'movie', ""n't"", 'based', 'particular', 'quot', 'FF', 'quot', 'game', 'contain', 'key', 'element', 'Gaia', 'One', 'binding', 'links', 'quot', 'FF', 'quot', 'games', 'unifying', 'force', 'power', 'world', 'together', 'element', 'sure', 'quot', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'quot', ""n't"", 'using', 'quot', 'FF', 'quot', 'crutch.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'trouble', 'spot', 'will', 'admit', 'Ming-na', 'Aki', 'sometimes', 'faltered', 'bland', 'forced', 'mode', 'acting', 'did', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Doctor', 'Sid', 'made', 'cringe', 'occasionally', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'James', 'Woods', 'gave', 'almost', 'solid', 'performance', 'General', 'Heim', 'made', 'favorite', 'character', 'movie', 'rest', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'so-so', 'alternating', 'good', 'not-so-good', 'voice-acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'definately', 'could', ""'ve"", 'improved', 'One', 'minor', 'note', 'occasionally', 'voices', 'did', 'speak', 'synch', 'lips', ""n't"", 'degrade', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'it.To', 'put', 'simply', 'quot', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'quot', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'people', 'love', 'simplistic', 'occasionally', 'cliched', 'sci-fi', 'storylines', 'others', 'loathe', 'want', 'something', 'original', 'movie', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'computer', 'graphics', 'unfortunately', 'short', 'terms', 'execution', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reccommend', 'anyone', 'appeal', 'movie', 'very', 'difficult', 'pin', 'down', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'see']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

I'm guessing they only used the Final Fantasy license to sell this movie better.The Spirits within is the most advanced movie in terms of visuals, but Caveman could have thought up a better plot. The only reason to see the movie is the incredible computer animation, You almost forget that this is not live action. The only other things good about the movie is the word to mouth translation between the actors and the computer animated characters are right on target. The acting does a good job bringing the characters to life with voices by actors such as Alec Baldwin, Steve Buscemi, and Hironobu Sakaguchi.

Upon research on the internet, there's quite a bit of history behind the Final Fantasy series.  Therefore, relating the game to the movie is difficult for me to actually grasp, and die-hard fans will probably have a better relationship with it.  Still, I'd rather concentrate on the other aspects of the film.First what's been hyped:  CGI.  Yes, a real great effort.  In the commentary of the DVD they said that they were learning new things along the way; you can see the characters go from slightly stiff to more natural actions as the movie progresses.  The facial expressions as well as the movement of the mouths for speaking wasn't natural -- but honestly, I have yet to see better in any animation.  A really incredible effort.The story:  well, I can say it's definitely not a kid's film.  It reminds me of Alien without all the gore and more of a spiritual aspect.  I have to say though, that I still don't understand the whole concept of the film and feel that I have to watch it again to completely grasp the storyline; it is a bit confusing upon only one viewing.  The basic premise, if you don't know a thing about it, is there are these aliens called &quot;phantoms&quot; roaming the earth, killing people by mere touch, therefore causing the earth to undergo great stress as well as evacuation.  There are two options to kill these beings: first being the Zeus cannon, which literally blows it away, but is frowned upon by the intelligence group who wants to match it's &quot;wave frequency&quot; instead.  The Zeus cannon would probably destroy the spirit of the earth causing more harm than good.  You have the group that is peaceful and bases their options on theories (the good guys) and you have the bad group who is a bitter general who wants to merely go in and blow anything away.  The climax is excellent, but I have to say the ending was a tremendous let down.  I wanted to see more of what happened when it did (but obviously can't tell you because I'd spoil it for ya.)It is a fairly dark film with plenty of action, aggressive scenes and really cool characters.  Although I'm afraid that not once did I forget the characters were not CGI, rather I was amazed at how fluid their actions were, but sometimes not.  Sci-fi fans will probably be thrilled as well as Final Fantasy fans, but people first exposed to this series (media-wise) might be confused and not get the point.  I think I'll have to watch it again to really get it, but also, I'm the more optimistic reviewer; some people may not have that patience.Nice eye candy, but the story is so detailed for die-hard fans, it may go over other people's heads.",3,Mixed feelings about a real effort,1005264000,"11 9, 2001",2001,2728,"['Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'game', 'was', 'slightly', 'confused', 'premise', 'research', 'internet', 'quite', 'bit', 'history', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'series', 'Therefore', 'relating', 'game', 'movie', 'difficult', 'actually', 'grasp', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'better', 'relationship', 'Still', ""'d"", 'rather', 'concentrate', 'other', 'aspects', 'film.First', 'what', 'been', 'hyped', 'CGI', 'Yes', 'real', 'great', 'effort', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'said', 'were', 'learning', 'new', 'things', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'characters', 'go', 'slightly', 'stiff', 'more', 'natural', 'actions', 'movie', 'facial', 'expressions', 'as', 'well', 'movement', 'mouths', 'speaking', 'was', ""n't"", 'natural', 'honestly', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'better', 'animation', 'really', 'incredible', 'effort.The', 'story', 'well', 'can', 'say', 'definitely', 'not', 'kid', 'film', 'Alien', 'gore', 'more', 'spiritual', 'aspect', 'have', 'say', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'whole', 'concept', 'film', 'feel', 'have', 'watch', 'again', 'completely', 'grasp', 'storyline', 'bit', 'confusing', 'only', 'one', 'viewing', 'basic', 'premise', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'thing', 'are', 'aliens', 'called', 'quot', 'quot', 'roaming', 'earth', 'killing', 'people', 'mere', 'touch', 'therefore', 'causing', 'earth', 'undergo', 'great', 'stress', 'as', 'well', 'evacuation', 'are', 'two', 'options', 'kill', 'beings', 'first', 'being', 'Zeus', 'cannon', 'literally', 'away', 'frowned', 'intelligence', 'group', 'who', 'match', 'quot', 'wave', 'frequency', 'quot', 'instead', 'Zeus', 'cannon', 'would', 'probably', 'destroy', 'spirit', 'earth', 'causing', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'have', 'group', 'peaceful', 'options', 'theories', 'good', 'guys', 'have', 'bad', 'group', 'who', 'bitter', 'general', 'who', 'merely', 'go', 'blow', 'anything', 'away', 'climax', 'excellent', 'have', 'say', 'ending', 'was', 'tremendous', 'let', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'did', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'d"", 'spoil', 'ya', 'fairly', 'dark', 'film', 'plenty', 'action', 'aggressive', 'scenes', 'really', 'cool', 'characters', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'forget', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'CGI', 'rather', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'fluid', 'actions', 'were', 'sometimes', 'not', 'Sci-fi', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'thrilled', 'as', 'well', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'fans', 'people', 'first', 'exposed', 'series', 'media-wise', 'might', 'be', 'confused', 'not', 'get', 'point', 'think', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'again', 'really', 'get', 'also', ""'m"", 'more', 'optimistic', 'reviewer', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'patience.Nice', 'eye', 'candy', 'story', 'so', 'detailed', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'may', 'go', 'other', 'people', 'heads']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

542634,A36WS7A1CHIB4B,B00003CY5C,"Brooke Pennington ""Renaissance girl""","[1, 2]","My perspective on this film is that of someone who has never played any of the video games, so I came to it prepared for a sci-fi film, and nothing more. The plot concerns a future where ""phantoms"" have decimated the earth, making it uninhabitable except to humans living inside shielded cities. A scientist, Dr. Aki Ross, and her mentor Dr. Sid, have developed an energy-based theory of how to rid the world of the phantoms. The ruling government wants to see hard facts, though, and so Aki and Sid must gather life-forms to put together a wave that will cancel out the wavelength of the phantoms' energy. Or something like that. What follows is a surreal, psychdelic journey to destroy the transparent phantom spirits and find the heart of the phantom planet's Gaia.""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" is a treat to watch. The landscapes are stunning, imaginative, and visionary, while still looking recognizable enough that one of your dreams might happen in them. The computer-generated people are slightly lacking, but they are still amazingly lifelike. The main problem I had with watching the people is that their movements are too fluid and regular. Watching the characters move is like watching a film composed of live actors who have all had thirty years of ballet training. But the movements of hair and the size of skin pores have obviously been well thought out, and the result is gorgeous to see.That said, maybe your eyes will be too busy with this one for your brain to pay attention to the quasi-new-age speeches some characters give. A live actor might have been embarrassed by a line such as, ""With the hope of new life has Gaia changed the phantom within."" Fortunately, the computer-generated Aki can deliver that line sincerely and earnestly, perhaps putting off some who might otherwise snicker at such ideas. The Steve Buscemi-voiced Neil has some humorous lines, but he is obviously meant to be comic relief in a film whose main concern is themes of Cosmic Significance. The script does a rather tired, cliched job of expressing those themes, however. But that's not really the point of a film like this; it was obviously made to be looked at more than analyzed, and on that level it succeeds fully. This would make a great film for lightly altered states of mind, though perhaps some of the darker imagery would be too intense for very strong intoxicants ;) !Notes re the DVD version: Watching the ""Boards and Blasts"" version of the film with the ""subtitled factoids"" on is pretty interesting. It really shows how much work went into making these characters, as you can see how rough they looked at some points in the animation process. However, at times the factoids are going so fast that you have to rewind to be able to read them all. The info about the characters provided on the second disc, such as all of their astrological signs, is intriguing if you get really into the world of the movie and want to know more.

Along the way she is joined by the prestigious Deep Eyes squadron who's Captain is an old friend of Dr. Ross. Dr. Cid is in a struggle to convince a critical government that these spirits or Phantoms can easily be defeated by collecting these entities rather than using firepower which Cid knows is making the spirit situation worse.The Review: Since first seeing this film in 2001 I have always been a big supporter and defender of this film. The storytelling is simply superb as it introduces us one by one to each character and makes us feel sympathetic towards these characters and their fight to solve the problem that is plaguing the Earth.The animation even when compared to todays standards is truly spectacular and was evidently ahead of its time. The animation of this film is comparable to many of the cut scenes from this generation of video gaming, showing us that the level of realism achieved in this film is easily doable now and it makes me think the animators should make a new film to show us what they can achieve with todays technology.The suspense and drama of some scenes is something that I don't feel can be matched by a lot of todays films. For example the scene when the spirits invade a human habitat which originally protected them, the chase scenes and the general emotion is placed within you through your belief in the characters.The primary criticism that people have of this film is the slow pacing. Many American or UK movie goers wouldn't be familiar with this style as it's a very Japanese style of storytelling, traditionally known for its slow pace to allow for better character development. Over the years many Asian movies have become cult favourites amongst American and UK audiences. Movies such as Lady Vengeance and Oldboy are prime examples of how the Western audiences have begun to embrace this style of storytelling, which I believe if Final Fantasy were to be released in the Cinemas today it would gain a much better reception than it did when it was first released.The voice casting is spectacular with a truly stellar cast of names such as Alec Baldwin, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi to name but a few and they genuinely do not disappoint.A very, very good movie and a must for all those Sci-Fi, Drama and animation fans.",5,Highly Under-Appreciated,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2465,"['Story', 'female', 'scientist', 'known', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'race', 'time', 'gather', 'together', 'spirit', 'entities', 'would', 'help', 'defeat', 'invading', 'Alien', 'spirits', 'threatening', 'Human', 'existence', 'way', 'joined', 'prestigious', 'Deep', 'Eyes', 'squadron', 'who', 'Captain', 'old', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Ross', 'Dr.', 'Cid', 'struggle', 'convince', 'critical', 'government', 'spirits', 'Phantoms', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'defeated', 'collecting', 'entities', 'rather', 'using', 'firepower', 'Cid', 'making', 'spirit', 'situation', 'worse.The', 'Review', 'first', 'seeing', 'film', '2001', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'supporter', 'defender', 'film', 'storytelling', 'simply', 'superb', 'one', 'one', 'character', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'characters', 'fight', 'solve', 'problem', 'plaguing', 'Earth.The', 'animation', 'even', 'when', 'compared', 'todays', 'standards', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'was', 'evidently', 'ahead', 'time', 'animation', 'film', 'comparable', 'many', 'cut', 'scenes', 'generation', 'video', 'gaming', 'showing', 'level', 'realism', 'achieved', 'film', 'easily', 'doable', 'now', 'think', 'animators', 'should', 'make', 'new', 'film', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'achieve', 'todays', 'technology.The', 'suspense', 'drama', 'scenes', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'can', 'be', 'matched', 'lot', 'todays', 'films', 'example', 'scene', 'when', 'spirits', 'invade', 'human', 'habitat', 'originally', 'protected', 'chase', 'scenes', 'general', 'emotion', 'placed', 'belief', 'characters.The', 'primary', 'criticism', 'people', 'have', 'film', 'slow', 'pacing', 'Many', 'American', 'UK', 'movie', 'goers', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'familiar', 'style', 'very', 'Japanese', 'style', 'storytelling', 'traditionally', 'known', 'slow', 'pace', 'allow', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'years', 'many', 'Asian', 'movies', 'have', 'become', 'cult', 'amongst', 'American', 'UK', 'audiences', 'Movies', 'such', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'Oldboy', 'are', 'prime', 'examples', 'how', 'Western', 'audiences', 'have', 'begun', 'embrace', 'style', 'storytelling', 'believe', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'were', 'be', 'released', 'Cinemas', 'today', 'would', 'gain', 'much', 'better', 'reception', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released.The', 'voice', 'casting', 'spectacular', 'truly', 'stellar', 'cast', 'names', 'such', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'name', 'few', 'genuinely', 'do', 'not', 'disappoint.A', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'must', 'Sci-Fi', 'Drama', 'animation', 'fans']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

What i saw surprised me greatly.First off, the animation and computer visuals of this movie are beyond stunning. There are numerous scenes that you would be hard pressed to think its not real life. The characters look brilliant and the voice acting is superb. Every voice actor fits its on screen character and they are all top notch.Though Aki's hair looked incredibly stiff and unrealistic to me...But hows the story?Great!I wasnt 'confused' with the plot and story like so many others seemed to be. It was a somewhat generic and cliched plot of invading aliens which need to be stopped, but it worked remarkably well.I also found the movie to be funny, the action to be entertaining, and the characters to be likeable.I loved Woods as the evil general and i loved Buscemis character. I really connected with most of the characters and i felt for them when some of them met an early demise...All in all, i was thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and viewing of Final Fantasy.

I forgot from time to time that you look at an animated movie all together. The animations look so real from time to time that you think that you are watching a live action movie.Too bad that the movie did not so well at the box office, but it got rewarded with huge DVD sales afterwards, when people discovered the movie. I bet that the movie would have been a Box Office hit as well, if they would have market it properly.

Dr. Aki Ross is a scientist on the verge of discovering the secrets of these &quot;spirits&quot; and restore the Earth back to the hands of humanity, through channeling 8 spirits to provide balance to Earth Gaia. However, General Hein, who backs the military wing of humanity, wants to use a space weapon called the &quot;Zeus&quot; gun to destroy the core of this alien infestation, a meteor crater home to the rock in which the spirits landed on. Aki feels that doing what the General is willing to do will destroy the Earth and Hein thinks her idea is plain lunacy and will never work. Meanwhile, Dr. Aki is having these dreams that are building together pieces that will eventually solve the mystery of these spirit invaders, but time is soon running out.Pros: The animation is something that is simply incredible. Everything from the body movements to the facial expressions make it look like you are watching real people. It makes it even more natural to have computer generated characters because they seem to fit better in CGI worlds than humans do.Dr. Aki Ross is a sympathetic character and you eventually begin to feel empathy for her character. However, she is not given any 3D depth and often is pushed to the side to showcase the technical aspects of this movie.James Woods, who plays General Hein and Donald Sutherland as Aki mentor Dr. Sid are excellent. Woods, who always seems to play hard headed sinister character was perfectly cast as was Sutherland, whose voice would often remind me of a professor that I once had.Cons: The plot is horrible. There are these 8 spirits, but what are these spirits? What are the differences between spirit one and spirit eight? What is the silly notion of Gaia? Such things are not adequately explained in the movie, causing confusion. I guess they are explained in the Final Fantasy games?The ending was also roughly 15 minutes too long. It tended to drag on and on, without adding anything to the movie. It was a downer and lowered the overall enjoyment of the movie.The Cheesiness of the movie also caused rolling eyes. While there is no emotions, there is this &quot;oh I love you stuff&quot;, straight out of 1950's harlequin romance novels.There is no emotional bond with the characters. They are there, they interact, they crack some jokes, shoot some guns and some of them die. You get as much emotionally involved as an episode of Pokemon.Overall, while blown away by the SFX, I cannot recommend this movie, because it is not film.

But I decided to rent Final Fantasy first after losing $25 bucks on Titan A.E.From a technical perspective, the film film is hit and miss.  Group shots and anything shown from a distance work very well. Backrounds and ships also worked.  Close ups of characters rarely worked, though some were better than others. It was obvious some characters (the old scientist) were paid more attention to.From a story standpoint, it was pure goofy anime. I consider myself a typical American viewer, and I will tell anyone interested that I think ships that look like big animals or any other animal related themes like the spirits in this film are just plain old silly.Computer animated movies would have a much better chance of mass popularity if their makers could license a known actor to &quot;star&quot; - my choice would be Bruce Lee.",2,"Great potential, poor execution",1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,942,"['was', 'tempted', 'buy', 'movie', 'want', 'support', 'computer', 'animation', 'infancy', 'decided', 'rent', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'first', 'losing', '25', 'bucks', 'Titan', 'A.E.From', 'technical', 'perspective', 'film', 'film', 'hit', 'miss', 'Group', 'shots', 'anything', 'shown', 'distance', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Backrounds', 'ships', 'also', 'worked', 'Close', 'ups', 'characters', 'rarely', 'worked', 'were', 'better', 'others', 'was', 'obvious', 'characters', 'old', 'scientist', 'were', 'paid', 'more', 'attention', 'story', 'standpoint', 'was', 'pure', 'goofy', 'anime', 'consider', 'typical', 'American', 'viewer', 'will', 'tell', 'anyone', 'interested', 'think', 'ships', 'look', 'big', 'animals', 'other', 'animal', 'related', 'themes', 'spirits', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'silly.Computer', 'animated', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'chance', 'mass', 'popularity', 'makers', 'could', 'license', 'known', 'actor', 'quot', 'star', 'quot', 'choice', 'would', 'be', 'Bruce', 'Lee']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

Muddled with hype, and over-glorifying of the bestselling Sony Playstation video games, this film falls far from the mark of making a good impression.  Starting with a fairly interesting beginning, the film slowly but surely begins to teeter off into literally nothing as it goes on.  Alec Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, and other greats make not so worthwhile voice over appearences, the characters strike the viewer as mostly incincere beings with no real emotions. For instance a scene in which the ship seems to be blowing up from the inside out, Sutherland's character, the doctor, calls out &quot; No Aki, don't go, its too dangerous.&quot;  Whereupon, he does absolutely nothing to stop her from going to the rear of the ship.  So, in retrospect, the movie offers little that would differ from actually watching a video game being played before your eyes, with characters that have as much underdeveloped and boring script as appears in most video games.  One plus, the movie does have excellent computer graphics, and the characters appear quite life-like in appearence, but does not make up for their overbearlingly boring drawl that seems to spill out of their mouth in every scene.",2,It was almost a real movie,1004832000,"11 4, 2001",2001,1270,"['was', 'almost', 'real', 'movie', 'just', 'characters', 'film-almost', 'real', 'Muddled', 'hype', 'over-glorifying', 'bestselling', 'Sony', 'Playstation', 'video', 'games', 'film', 'far', 'mark', 'making', 'good', 'impression', 'Starting', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'beginning', 'film', 'slowly', 'surely', 'teeter', 'off', 'literally', 'nothing', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'other', 'greats', 'make', 'not', 'so', 'worthwhile', 'voice', 'appearences', 'characters', 'strike', 'viewer', 'mostly', 'incincere', 'beings', 'real', 'emotions', 'instance', 'scene', 'ship', 'be', 'blowing', 'up', 'inside', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'doctor', 'out', 'quot', 'No', 'Aki', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'dangerous.', 'quot', 'Whereupon', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'stop', 'going', 'rear', 'ship', 'So', 'retrospect', 'movie', 'little', 'would', 'differ', 'actually', 'watching', 'video', 'game', 'being', 'played', 'eyes', 'characters', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'boring', 'script', 'most', 'video', 'games', 'One', 'movie', 'have', 'excellent', 'computer', 'graphics', 'characters', 'appear', 'quite', 'life-like', 'appearence', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'overbearlingly', 'boring', 'drawl', 'spill', 'mouth', 'scene']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS
542647,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00003CY5C,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","One thing that I rarely find with a game from Square is a bad story. Sure Final Fantasy VIII had its detractors but the story was quite intriguing and under that terrible translation was a really interesting story in Final Fantasy Tactics. But these and others took a long time to develop, little nuances and development over the course of a good 30-40 hours. Well Spirits Within clocks in at around an hour 40 and while the story is kind of interesting, there was a lot of missed opportunities here.It's 2065 and mankind is nearing extinction. A meteor crashed on Earth, bringing with it strange creatures named Phantoms. Scientist Aki Ross and her mentor Dr. Sid try to collect 8 special spirit waves which will actually defeat the phantoms. However, there is some problems as a General Hein is hellbent on destroying the Phantoms, even if it means the planet in the process.Another thing you'll always find in Square games is their knack for sweet FMV's or cutscenes. Ever since Final Fantasy VII introduced them to the series, they've gotten better and better at making really amazing scenes come to life(such as Galbadia vs Balamb Garden in VIII, the Black Waltz chase in IX, practically any FMV in X). The animation here is quite stellar, and although I noticed some faults, such as some odd looking artifacting on Hein's coat, this is quite something. It's not entirely perfect as character expressions still look kind of robotic and characters look kinda creepy, especially the eyes.How's the rest of the film? It's kind of meh. While the story has a good premise, it's marred by bad dialogue and a certain detached feeling. I never really cared about the people's spirits getting munched, I was just like ""wow, that looks cool!"". And I can't count how many versions of ""let's get out of here"" I found, then there's the ""city is lost"" line and countless others. Now maybe it's just my background in anime and games but the story isn't confusing and convoluted, in fact I could understand it perfectly so all that talk about it is really people who probably prefer Armageddon-type plots.

This first and only offering from the all-CG studio comes to me with mixed emotions as I eject the disc from my laptop. I want to say that this movie is superb, wonderful, awe-inspiring, etc., etc...but, past the animation itself, I just can't.Of course, the computer-generated animation is breathtaking; it's the most realistic CG I've ever seen anywhere. I'll admit, there were a few moments where I actually forgot I was watching an animated film. The characters move as fluidly across the screen as real human beings, and everything down to the last strand of hair is lifelike enough to reach out and touch. The voice-actors complement the characters very nicely as well; but a cast with the likes of James Woods, Alec Baldwin, and Donald Sutherland would make the dialogue from ""The Teletubbies"" worthy of an Oscar. The only thing I saw that could've used just a little polish was in the facial expressions. To me, that was the only quality that brought the animation back down to earth. Too bad Square won't have the chance to improve.As far as the movie itself goes...hm. The story is pretty unoriginal; nothing I haven't seen in sci-fi movies a dozen times before. The pace of the story, while full of CG-rific action and cool futuristic toys, did little to hold my attention. I found myself too far lost in the sheer visual beauty of it all. Even during the movie's climax, which tries really hard to be heart-rending, all I could say was, ""Man, this is awesome animation."" That was disappointing.What all but saved the whole package, though, was the DVD extras. I actually went through Disc 2 (several times) before even watching the movie, and that disc alone made it almost worth the purchase. The ""joke outtakes"" split my sides, and of course seeing how the film was put together is neat-o in any book. And the ""Thriller"" video...it takes a little ""digging"" to find, but it's just as good as everyone says it is, and just as funny.For a CG movie that took over 3 years to make, yeah, the animation is great, but apart from that and the extras, I can't really recommend buying this DVD with a clear conscience.

I've seen these themes before, yes, generic, maybe, a bad movie? Not really. Look, this movie could have been a lot better. We all know it. We all have our complaints. My biggest complaint was that someone other the Uematsu composed the score for this movie. Uematsu, of course, has done the music for all ten games thus far. I rather enjoyed the story, although I could see 'inspiration' from Aliens and Starship Troopers, the dialougue fit the film, though when Aki would cry and no tears came out of her eyes I found that disturbing. The facial expressions were all dead on, but no tears? Did anyone else find this puzzling? The movie was too short and had an ending that you have to be very into anime to understand or be able to cope with.

The appallingly badly written script is not about science, it is about some hokey earth-spirit mysticism connected with ghosts, and splices together all the usual clich&eacute;s of the late 20th century: beautiful ""mother earth"", an evil technocratic dictator, a final noble sacrifice for love... It bored me to tears. Even the animation, which was supposed to be its selling point, was unconvincing. The planes and angles of each character's face may be well rendered, but they moved like marionettes, and the prevaling darkness of all scenes - probably a deliberate attempt to give it a film-noir look - just made it visually muddy and confusing.My advice: save your money.

542666,A274QHZCDFXV4J,B00003CY5C,Dianelos Georgoudis,"[1, 1]","This is one amazing movie, different from anything you have ever seen. It is extremely ambitious. It is the first computer generated movie to try not only to be in 3D but to actually represent reality. A few characters, especially Dr. Sid, can fool you into thinking they are human, an incredible achievement. It is a science fiction story wrapped around a spiritual core, a very difficult proposition. It has adventure, aliens, alien war, romance, valor, tragedy, violence and pacifism. This is a conceptually, artistically and technically groundbreaking work.Does it work? Not quite.The graphics may be much more advanced than anything seen to date, including the contemporary Shrek, but they are flawed. Aki Ross, the main character, has a beautiful and soulful face, but her mouth seems chiseled on her chin, her teeth seem to be planted too far out and look like a fish's, her eyes are not wet but rather seem built of a hard plastic, her hair (each of the 60,000 threads individually animated) looks like a synthetic piece. Her body is too long, and her, uhm, bottom seems all wrong. Still she has an intriguing, star-like presence. Other characters, unfortunately are very cartoonish. All suffer from stiff bodies, their limbs attached to rigid torsos, as you see on plastic toys.By the way, the movie is not really computer generated. Rather the computer is used as a very powerful, knowledge based, colored pencil, under the control of human artists. The resulting visual experience reminds one of a very detailed drawing. Live actors were used to help the animators use the computer to render the movie's characters. No wonder, the whole thing cost 100 million dollars to make.The storyline is built around a complex spiritual core, which is revealed little by little in the movie. (If you haven't yet seen the movie you may want to jump to the next paragraph.) It proposes that each life bearing planet holds a spirit in the ground out of which each life form is born from and to which it returns after death. These planetary spirits are formed from some kind of wave, and, significantly, they are incompatible and deadly to each other. A fragment of an alien planet destroyed by nuclear war, has fallen on earth and has disgorged many deceased individual spirits of that planet, which move around like phantoms and lay waste to much of our life sphere.Well, this is a rather complicated background for most of the movie going public, not to say slightly derogatory of the Christian world view. Star War's &quot;the force be with you&quot; was a much simpler proposition. The joy in Final Fantasy is in taking in the beauty of the realistic but completely human-made world it depicts. Less spirituality and more laughs and sexual tension would certainly have made it more successful. This movie takes itself too seriously for its own good. Shrek's creators were smarter in this sense.I understand that Final Fantasy has been a financial flop. This is a great pity. Personally I would love to see Aki Ross again in a few years time, at 10 times better rendering technology. If a movie deserves a sequence, this is one. The movie's creators must realize that they own much more than the first photo realistic picture in human history, they also own the first human-made movie star. Let's hope they will be able to build on top of this amazing achievement.",5,Beautiful but complex,1008028800,"12 11, 2001",2001,3364,"['one', 'amazing', 'movie', 'different', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'extremely', 'ambitious', 'first', 'computer', 'generated', 'movie', 'try', 'not', 'only', 'be', '3D', 'actually', 'represent', 'reality', 'few', 'characters', 'especially', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'can', 'fool', 'thinking', 'are', 'human', 'incredible', 'achievement', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'wrapped', 'spiritual', 'core', 'very', 'difficult', 'proposition', 'adventure', 'aliens', 'alien', 'war', 'romance', 'valor', 'tragedy', 'violence', 'pacifism', 'conceptually', 'artistically', 'technically', 'groundbreaking', 'work.Does', 'work', 'Not', 'quite.The', 'graphics', 'may', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'advanced', 'anything', 'seen', 'date', 'including', 'contemporary', 'Shrek', 'are', 'flawed', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'main', 'character', 'beautiful', 'soulful', 'face', 'mouth', 'chiseled', 'chin', 'teeth', 'seem', 'be', 'planted', 'too', 'far', 'out', 'look', 'fish', 'eyes', 'are', 'not', 'wet', 'rather', 'seem', 'built', 'hard', 'plastic', 'hair', '60,000', 'threads', 'individually', 'animated', 'synthetic', 'piece', 'body', 'too', 'long', 'uhm', 'bottom', 'wrong', 'Still', 'intriguing', 'star-like', 'presence', 'Other', 'characters', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'very', 'cartoonish', 'suffer', 'stiff', 'bodies', 'limbs', 'attached', 'rigid', 'torsos', 'see', 'plastic', 'way', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'computer', 'generated', 'computer', 'used', 'very', 'powerful', 'knowledge', 'based', 'colored', 'pencil', 'control', 'human', 'artists', 'resulting', 'visual', 'experience', 'one', 'very', 'detailed', 'drawing', 'Live', 'actors', 'were', 'used', 'help', 'animators', 'use', 'computer', 'render', 'movie', 'characters', 'wonder', 'whole', 'thing', 'cost', '100', 'million', 'dollars', 'make.The', 'storyline', 'built', 'complex', 'spiritual', 'core', 'revealed', 'little', 'little', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'movie', 'may', 'want', 'jump', 'next', 'paragraph', 'life', 'bearing', 'planet', 'spirit', 'ground', 'life', 'form', 'born', 'death', 'planetary', 'spirits', 'are', 'formed', 'kind', 'wave', 'significantly', 'are', 'incompatible', 'deadly', 'other', 'fragment', 'alien', 'planet', 'destroyed', 'nuclear', 'war', 'fallen', 'earth', 'disgorged', 'many', 'deceased', 'individual', 'spirits', 'planet', 'move', 'phantoms', 'lay', 'waste', 'much', 'life', 'sphere.Well', 'rather', 'complicated', 'background', 'most', 'movie', 'going', 'public', 'not', 'say', 'slightly', 'derogatory', 'Christian', 'world', 'view', 'Star', 'War', 'quot', 'force', 'be', 'quot', 'was', 'much', 'simpler', 'proposition', 'joy', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'taking', 'beauty', 'realistic', 'completely', 'human-made', 'world', 'Less', 'spirituality', 'more', 'laughs', 'sexual', 'tension', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'successful', 'movie', 'too', 'seriously', 'own', 'good', 'Shrek', 'creators', 'were', 'smarter', 'sense.I', 'understand', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'been', 'financial', 'flop', 'great', 'pity', 'Personally', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'time', '10', 'times', 'better', 'rendering', 'technology', 'movie', 'sequence', 'one', 'movie', 'creators', 'must', 'realize', 'own', 'much', 'more', 'first', 'photo', 'realistic', 'picture', 'human', 'history', 'also', 'own', 'first', 'human-made', 'movie', 'star', 'Let', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'build', 'top', 'amazing', 'achievement']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS
542667,AVCRD98TH48RN,B00003CY5C,D. Knouse,"[2, 2]","As a feature for cutting-edge animation this film is a great success.  I often gaped at the amazing visual textures and dazzling color mixed with inventive sci-fi scenery.  However, the film is extremely cold with regards to emotional connection with the characters.  While the creatures and ships and battle-gear were all pristinely drawn, the expressions and walk of the human characters are stiff and mostly emotionless.  This makes for more of a cerebral experience along the lines of hard sci-fi rather than sci-fi fantasy.  The overall feel of the film is icy and soulless, but the animation is truly exceptional.  What saves this film from being completely frozen is one of the most underrated scores of the year composed by Elliot Goldenthal.  I own the CD to the soundtrack and I often play it while reading something creepy.  It enhances the movie with subtlety and provides much-needed lift to many of the otherwise spiritless sequences.  The song &quot;The Dream Within&quot; sung by Lara Fabian was also written by Elliot Goldenthal and is remarkable, especially with Lara Fabian's glorious voice soaring over the music.  But the real star of this film is the animation, which is certainly extraordinary.  There were many moments during the film that I forgot it was animated, the human characters look so life-like.

542668,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CY5C,D. Litton,"[0, 1]","In trying to think of how to put in words my thoughts on &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within,&quot; I'm slightly at a loss. After one hour and forty six minutes of watching a continuous special effect, I've come to the conclusion that the film will go down in history as a golden nugget of the modern era, and a symbol of the ongoing creation of bigger and better (not to mention believable) visual effects.And while the computer animation is eye-popping and awe-inspiring, the story behind it is passable enough to back it up, including some good character development and interaction, and a futuristic vision of Earth that has more ups than downs. This isn't sci-fi in the great tradition of the classics in the genre, but it provides a reason for the special effects, keeping them from seeming arbitrary and routine.The movie takes us to the year 2065, and Earth is desolate and barren, and overrun by years of war which pits the remains of the human race against strange, ghost-like creatures referred to as &quot;phantoms.&quot; Among these is Aki Ross (voiced by Ming-Na), a young female scientist in search of remaining life forms among barren sections of the planet. After an incident in the abandoned section of New York City, she meets up with former flame Captain Edwards (Alec Baldwin), who is assigned to guard her.But his assignment comes from a less-than-honorable general (James Woods), who wishes to incarcerate Aki when it is revealed that she is infected with a contained strand of the phantom phenomena, which seems to be breaking free of its confines within her. His true intention is to have a new military weapon approved for use against the menace, hoping to disprove the theory held by Aki and her mentor, Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland), that retrieving spirits of nature will create a force strong enough to wipe out the powerful juggernaut.This is where the story meets most of its ups and downs. When the story isn't trying to create a sense of awe and wonder through theological beliefs pertaining to the battle of good versus evil, it works well. The background history behind the phantoms will seem a bit contrived, even silly. Other plot lines, such as the sense of heroism instilled in the characters, and the battle between the scientists and the government officials, work much better.The characters are also some of the better-developed characters of the year, and they're all digital, for crying out loud. The movie devotes much time to developing each one individually, from a scene involving Aki and Edwards being trapped in an overhead observatory, to Aki's conversations with Dr. Sid. The interaction between the characters provides some laughs as well as some believable moments of heroic actions. Each voice talent gets into the mindset of their character, and makes their emotions appear as real as the CGI actors themselves.The movie's most memorable aspect, without a doubt, is the dazzling use of computer animation, which stands as a striking achievement in the history of movie-making. Composed entirely of CGI, the movie itself is one big special effect, one that is easily discernable from reality, but is nonetheless impressive in its audaciousness and its grand sense of scope and vision. The actors, I'm told, were created entirely from scratch, without the use of human digitization. Such facts as this create a heightened sense of appreciation for the effort and work that goes into a project such as this.&quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; becomes more than just a futuristic look at Earth: it also becomes a futuristic look at filmmaking. The story will be a bore to some looking for readily-believable theories and dialogue, and may even disappoint followers of the sci-fi genre, but it's not without its intentions, and it meets those intentions by bringing us filmmaking as we've never seen it before. We may be years away from seeing real actors completely replaced by digital ones, but after this film, the possibility has become frightening real.",4,A marvel of modern movie-making.,1003968000,"10 25, 2001",2001,4022,"['trying', 'think', 'how', 'put', 'words', 'thoughts', 'quot', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'quot', ""'m"", 'slightly', 'loss', 'one', 'hour', 'forty', 'six', 'minutes', 'watching', 'continuous', 'special', 'effect', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'golden', 'nugget', 'modern', 'era', 'symbol', 'ongoing', 'creation', 'bigger', 'better', 'not', 'mention', 'believable', 'visual', 'effects.And', 'computer', 'animation', 'eye-popping', 'awe-inspiring', 'story', 'passable', 'enough', 'back', 'up', 'including', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'interaction', 'futuristic', 'vision', 'Earth', 'more', 'ups', 'downs', ""n't"", 'sci-fi', 'great', 'tradition', 'classics', 'genre', 'reason', 'special', 'effects', 'keeping', 'seeming', 'arbitrary', 'routine.The', 'movie', 'year', '2065', 'Earth', 'desolate', 'barren', 'overrun', 'years', 'war', 'remains', 'human', 'race', 'strange', 'ghost-like', 'creatures', 'referred', 'quot', 'quot', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'voiced', 'Ming-Na', 'young', 'female', 'scientist', 'search', 'remaining', 'life', 'forms', 'barren', 'sections', 'planet', 'incident', 'abandoned', 'section', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'up', 'former', 'flame', 'Captain', 'Edwards', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'assigned', 'guard', 'her.But', 'assignment', 'less-than-honorable', 'general', 'James', 'Woods', 'who', 'incarcerate', 'Aki', 'when', 'revealed', 'infected', 'contained', 'strand', 'phantom', 'phenomena', 'be', 'breaking', 'free', 'confines', 'true', 'intention', 'have', 'new', 'military', 'weapon', 'approved', 'use', 'menace', 'hoping', 'disprove', 'theory', 'held', 'Aki', 'mentor', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'retrieving', 'spirits', 'nature', 'will', 'create', 'force', 'strong', 'enough', 'wipe', 'out', 'powerful', 'juggernaut.This', 'where', 'story', 'most', 'ups', 'downs', 'When', 'story', ""n't"", 'trying', 'create', 'sense', 'awe', 'wonder', 'theological', 'beliefs', 'pertaining', 'battle', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'well', 'background', 'history', 'phantoms', 'will', 'seem', 'bit', 'contrived', 'even', 'silly', 'Other', 'plot', 'lines', 'such', 'sense', 'heroism', 'instilled', 'characters', 'battle', 'scientists', 'government', 'officials', 'work', 'much', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'better-developed', 'characters', 'year', ""'re"", 'digital', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'movie', 'much', 'time', 'developing', 'one', 'individually', 'scene', 'involving', 'Aki', 'Edwards', 'being', 'trapped', 'overhead', 'observatory', 'Aki', 'conversations', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'interaction', 'characters', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', 'believable', 'moments', 'heroic', 'actions', 'voice', 'talent', 'mindset', 'character', 'emotions', 'appear', 'as', 'real', 'CGI', 'actors', 'themselves.The', 'movie', 'most', 'memorable', 'aspect', 'doubt', 'dazzling', 'use', 'computer', 'animation', 'striking', 'achievement', 'history', 'movie-making', 'Composed', 'entirely', 'CGI', 'movie', 'one', 'big', 'special', 'effect', 'one', 'easily', 'discernable', 'reality', 'nonetheless', 'impressive', 'audaciousness', 'grand', 'sense', 'scope', 'vision', 'actors', ""'m"", 'told', 'were', 'created', 'entirely', 'scratch', 'use', 'human', 'digitization', 'Such', 'facts', 'create', 'heightened', 'sense', 'appreciation', 'effort', 'work', 'project', 'such', 'this.', 'quot', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'quot', 'more', 'just', 'futuristic', 'look', 'Earth', 'also', 'futuristic', 'look', 'filmmaking', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'bore', 'looking', 'readily-believable', 'theories', 'dialogue', 'may', 'even', 'disappoint', 'followers', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'not', 'intentions', 'intentions', 'bringing', 'filmmaking', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'may', 'be', 'years', 'away', 'seeing', 'real', 'actors', 'completely', 'replaced', 'digital', 'ones', 'film', 'possibility', 'become', 'frightening', 'real']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS
542669,A3VQLTB724O77W,B00003CY5C,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[2, 2]","I find myself in a curious position of praising Final Fantasy to the skies although I abhor the idea of making a movie based on a computer game. The film stands complete apart from the games. No characters from the games appear in the film, nor will a filmgoer ever feel left in the dark if they are completely unfamiliar with the games. Apparently only the Gaia--Earth Spirit concept and the idea of worlds in which magic and technology coexist are held in common, and perhaps the overall tone of the game. Viewers hoping for a two hour reenactment of their favorite game are bound to be disappointed; but those willing to accept the movie only in the spirit of those games will surely be thrilled.Final Fantasy is every bit as stunning as the trailers and previews and pre-release publicity would lead you to believe. The animation is quite simply the most realistic I have ever seen. The detail of the characters, from their complexions to the way they move, left me in awe of the artistry--several times during the film I found myself literally saying aloud &quot;I can't believe it!&quot; And other times, I found myself NOT amazed at the animation--not because it was bad, but honestly because I was not thinking of it as animation! (Only very rarely, with the movement of a single character (Neil) was the realism ever broken--fans of animated films will know that different characters are created by different animators.) Equally fascinating was the imagery itself--the alien worlds and alien beings (with a single exception--a flying, snakelike dragon which was rather typically and disappointingly commonplace Oriental) were highly imaginative and the colors and tone of the film superbly stylistic. The creatures take their inspiration from the microscopic world--imagine dust mites expanded thousands of times, with tentacles! Some viewers might be reminded of the bio-mechanical worlds of H. R. Giger (Alien), and there is certainly an influence, but no more than that. In terms of visuals, this movie should win many Oscars, or there is no justice.Plotwise, the film does not quite meet the same high standards. The story is somewhat like a more mature version of Titan A.E. (Earth destroyed by non-material evil aliens, wicked military-type human in position of authority almost ruins everything, hero[ine] on a quest with friends to find the one weapon which can destroy the evil aliens in a single blow), with a touch of The Fifth Element and Captain Planet thrown in for good measure. Sensitive preteens may well find the story too frightening and intense--most of the important characters die, and unlike in a Disney film, don't come back to life.

542671,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B00003CY5C,dylan21484nj,"[3, 3]","Final Fantasy has long been a watershed videogame series since its start, but did not get its due praise in the United States until series' first foray into 3D territory with its seventh installment, Final Fantasy VII. seeing the game's worldwide success, it didn't take long for Hollywood to start looking for a way to capitalize on the Final Fantasy name. A Final Fantasy movie was announced and went into production.With the exception of Final Fantasy X-2 and the series of media based on the world and characters of Final Fantasy VII, each game in the Final Fantasy franchise bears all-new characters, settings, and stories, though themes and aesthetic aspects do recur throughout the series. And The Spirits Within carried on this tradition. This of course garnered criticism, since fans of the games preferred to see some of the characters and settings they loved from the games on the big screen (this complaint was remedied by the release of fanboy-friendly film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children a few years later). But from a storytelling standpoint, creating a story completely independent from the games was likely the most logical choice in order for the film to appeal to a much broader moviegoing audience that would likely be unfamiliar with the games. And since each game in the series takes hours upon hours of gameplay to complete, being able to encapsulate one of the games' stories in a 2-hour film would be impossible. The film also received criticism from ""old school"" Final Fantasy fans because it shared science fiction elements similar to some of the more recent installments of the game series rather than the medieval ""sword and sorcery"" elements of the franchise's earlier games. Some even complained about the film's overall lack of magic and monsters, aspects found in all of the games.The film is set in the year 2065. Strange ghost-like alien creatures called Phantoms have seemingly invaded Earth, sucking the life force from anyone and anything they encounter. The planet is reduced to a barren wasteland, and humanity's remaining survivors fortify themselves within cities protected by enegry barriers to keep the Phantoms out. Aki Ross, a doctor working for the military and her mentor Dr. Cid work to complete an energy wave that will eliminate the Phantoms without the use of force, but the trigger-happy General Hein believes that the only way to defeat the Phantoms is by firing all available weaponry at them, even it may destroy the Earth in the process.Though the film took several years and $140 million dollars to make (due to the fact that the technology used to make the film wasn't created until the movie went into production), the film only made back rough $40 million of its budget and is considered by some to be one of the biggest bombs in film history. Reviews were tepid, though some, like reknowned critic Roger Ebert, applauded the film's attempt at telling a deep story and melding of Westerner and Eastern philosophy and storytelling. The film's lukewarm reviews may have to do with the film's plot, which centers around the Eastern philosophy of the ""Gaia Theory"" that Western film critics and moviegoers were mostly unfamiliar with. The film's photorealism also came into question, since characters would look startling real at one moment, then more like dolls the next.The Spirits Within marks the first time CGI (that's Computer Generated Imagery) was used to create deatailed, photorealistic human characters, right down to Aki's hairs. It also marks the first time (and as of the moment this review is being written, the only time) a Final Fantasy story is set on Earth, though a futuristic Earth. previous works in the Final Fantasy franchise were set on fantasy planets that were Earth-like in nature only. Our Earth was likely used at the film's setting so it would be unnecessary to explain a whole new world to the audience.Though it is remembered by many as a failure (the film production company created by the game developers to make the movie went bankrupt from the $100 million dollar loss), it is much easier now to look back on the film as one of the better films to be made from or inspired by video games, and to appreciate it for its technological achievements and its attempt to tell a very un-Hollywood kind of story.",4,Underrated gem of a film,1228608000,"12 7,

It is hardly mainstream, it has many traditional anime-like qualities that many people have a hard time swallowing.  The story involves spirits of planets and mystical energies that exist all around us.  This in and of itself isn't original, but the way it is presented is.  The whole movie is straight-faced, there is no self-awareness or self-deprecation like a lot of anime, it is all taken seriously.  This surprised me, and I liked it.  The self-reference and quirky in-jokes of anime have grown tiresome to me.  That lack of humor doesn't really explain the lack of box-office clout, I guess people just weren't convinced that the story would live up the animation.  Also, it's named after a video game, that probably scared some people off too.  Whatever people did come, were either fans of the games or were curious about the animation.  The animation simply put is amazing, while the characters don't look as lifelike as people had claimed, the amount of expression is astounding.  The mannerisms of a character are developed substancially and the detailed facial expressions are breathtaking.  The locales where these characters reside are also beautiful, dirty, or disturbing depending on the circumstances.  Squaresoft and Columbia, obviously disappointed by the lackluster performance at the box-office are supplying a magnificent DVD for the fans of the film, which of course includes me.  This film will gather a larger following on video, of that I am sure, and people will come to regret not seeing the magnificent visions on the big screen where they belong.",4,It's you.

Judging by the trailers, it looked like it would be an instant hit among the general public. But the poor box office results and the lack of an Oscar nomination proved otherwise, and this resulted in the end of Square Pictures as they assured everyone that another 3D-animated film will never be made again. A lot of people believe that the reason why this movie was either it was not successful was the minimal advertising of that it had nothing to do with the FF video games. I never played the games, but I think there's another reason why this movie failed to please the general public.First off, I must say that the animation is downright flawless. Every scene is extraordinarily detailed: the lighting, the buildings, even the skin on the characters look absolutely real. CGI animation has really advanced over the years (same can't be said for Dreamworks, however). The problem with this movie, unfortunately, is that the animation is only one of the two redeeming factors (the other being that it has a very adult approach to CGI animation). The plot is weak: even though the storyline is far more mature than the ones in films like Open Season or Meet the Robinsons, it's still not strong enough to sustain interest. The characters are unbelievably thin: some of them are cardboard cut-outs, and most of them I could hardly care about. The romantic subplot is ridiculous: it seems like nothing but filler and is very distracting. The movie overall is somewhat hollow, and I think it's due to the simple fact that the real-looking characters can't handle real human emotions. When one character feels sad, it doesn't look or feel real. Maybe they could have used real actors.Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a mixed bag. I admire the fantastic animation and the look of the film's grim environments. I also credit this film for having a very adult atmosphere surrounding the story and settings. However, the plot and characters are nothing special, and they're not very compelling. I can recommend this film for its great look, but nothing else.Grade: C",3,"Animation is spectacular, but.....",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,2175,"['know', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'big', 'one', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'back', '2001', 'Judging', 'trailers', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'instant', 'hit', 'general', 'public', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'results', 'lack', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'proved', 'otherwise', 'resulted', 'end', 'Square', 'Pictures', 'assured', 'everyone', '3D-animated', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'again', 'lot', 'people', 'believe', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'successful', 'was', 'minimal', 'advertising', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'FF', 'video', 'games', 'never', 'played', 'games', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'failed', 'please', 'general', 'public.First', 'must', 'say', 'animation', 'downright', 'flawless', 'scene', 'extraordinarily', 'detailed', 'lighting', 'buildings', 'even', 'skin', 'characters', 'look', 'absolutely', 'real', 'CGI', 'animation', 'really', 'advanced', 'years', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'Dreamworks', 'however', 'problem', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'animation', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'redeeming', 'factors', 'other', 'being', 'very', 'adult', 'approach', 'CGI', 'animation', 'plot', 'weak', 'even', 'storyline', 'far', 'more', 'mature', 'ones', 'films', 'Open', 'Season', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'still', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'sustain', 'interest', 'characters', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'thin', 'are', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'most', 'could', 'hardly', 'care', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'ridiculous', 'nothing', 'filler', 'very', 'distracting', 'movie', 'overall', 'somewhat', 'hollow', 'think', 'due', 'simple', 'fact', 'real-looking', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'real', 'human', 'emotions', 'When', 'one', 'character', 'feels', 'sad', ""n't"", 'look', 'feel', 'real', 'Maybe', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'real', 'actors.Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'mixed', 'bag', 'admire', 'fantastic', 'animation', 'look', 'film', 'grim', 'environments', 'also', 'credit', 'film', 'having', 'very', 'adult', 'atmosphere', 'surrounding', 'story', 'settings', 'However', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'compelling', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'great', 'look', 'nothing', 'else.Grade', 'C']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS
542680,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,B00003CY5C,"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic""","[1, 1]","The main thing about this film that grabs the viewer is, naturally, how absolutely stunning the animation is. Best viewed on the big screen to fully appreciate the detail, the film does translate pretty well to DVD. It took years to complete, and the end result has done the animators proud - after a few minutes, I basically forgot that the characters on the screen weren't actors. In fact, I kept getting confused, because there was a very real-looking man running around with Donald Sutherland's voice, but who looked nothing like him at all. There were times when the movement of the bodies was a little too ... ""smooth,"" maybe, but by and large, just wow. The voice work was also very good, with the aforementioned Donald Sutherland, as well as Peri Gilpin, Ming Na, Steve Buscemi, and James Woods. As I mentioned, I frequently almost forgot they were all animated; the fabric moved as fabric moves, their hair was very close to real-looking and moved as hair moves, the characters had pores in their skin, individual eyelashes, and skin blemishes. The effort and CPU time that went into all of this is just overwhelming.The plot left me desirous of something...*more*, however. It wasn't exactly weak...it just wasn't fleshed-out enough (har, no pun intended.) I very much liked the ideas and concepts behind a lot of the story, particularly the earth-based spirituality aspects, but I wasn't satisfied with the resolution. It was kind of ""Starship Troopers"" meets ""Princess Mononoke."" Kind of.Until we find out what the ""phantoms"" are, they're pretty darned scary and mysterious. I really enjoyed them, especially the gigantic and flying phantoms, because they really fed into my phobia of being chased by huge monsters that can kill me. I like to be scared, and the phantoms worked for me in a lot of ways.I can't quite pin down why I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked to, and I'm going to have to go see it again. I guess I was so enamored with some of the film's concepts early on that I really wanted them to be taken further than they were.

They spent millions on computer imagery and 25 cents on the screenplay.  Although the movie is supposed to be science fiction/adventure, the &quot;action&quot; scenes (in which humans battle alien ghosts) are some of the most boring action scenes I've ever seen.  Hard to say how they got so dull--but the timing is way off, the editing is very bad, so the &quot;action&quot; fizzles.  The story is mostly similar to &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, a far superior bit of animation, but &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; reheats Mononoke's mysticism, spirits and eco-consciousness--unfortunately, in &quot;Fantasy&quot; there's no dramatic tension or likeable characters, so who cares.  A lot of the action scenes are stolen from &quot;Aliens&quot;--the team of well-equipped military types fighting aliens with great big guns is a completely theft from &quot;Aliens&quot;--but here they're boring, boring, boring.  When major characters die, I felt nothing.  As for the animation, the characters look very real when they're standing still.  But when Aki moves, she looks so stiff, like a robot--even in &quot;Toy Story&quot; characters moved more naturally.  Apparently 42 programmers spent a year animating the thousands of hairs on Aki's head, and she's got a great hairdo.  Her face is cute.  But the facial expressions on all the characters are laughably bad, like extremely stiff, amateurish acting.

Dr Aki has been infected, but her associate Dr Cid has it under control, using a method that might free the Earth from the phantom invasion. Since the infection, Dr Aki is haunted by strange dreams, which she struggles to find a meaning to. Will she figure out what they mean?

It just doesn't make good sense.  The odds of anybody actually reading mine are pretty much zero.  But I felt like doing this one anyway, just because I apreciate this film a great deal.I'll start off by saying that I've never played a Final Fantasy game, with the exeption of the FF3 version for the old school Nintendo Gameboy.  I do keep up on the animation though, and download any previews that I can get my hands on.  So it seemed perfect for me that Square would come out with one non-stop video.I'm impressed by the video quality.  The animation is realistic, rather than the stylized characters that have been used in the video games.  Even though the animation has a long way to go, it's still the most impressive, realistic that I've ever seen.  This is as far as it gets from Jar Jar Binks.  More impressive is that no human models were used to input the movements.  All the more power to them.I enjoyed the story.  And it's a dark story.  I know there are people out there who resent any story that doesn't have a Disney happy ending.  If you're one of those people,a) Grow upb) and don't buy this movie.  You won't like it.I don't know why people keep refering to this movie as an adaptation of a video game.  Honestly, in my opinion, if it had meant to be an adaptation, it would have adapted a previous storyline.  It would have been Final Fantasy 8: The Movie.  Or something like that.  Or to look at it another way, nobody ever disliked Super Mario Brothers: The Movie because Mario didn't have to jump on top of the head of a turtle-type thing waving a candycane to save the princess.

The plot started out pretty intriguing, and I wanted very much to learn more about these alien creatures. However, by the end, it had basically resorted to a mix of horrible generic character stereotypes and gross negligence toward the laws of physics. On the &quot;bad character stereotypes&quot; end, there's the scientist that no one else believes, and in the end we find out he's right; there's the military commando guy who wants to nuke everything and refuses to listen to anyone else's opinion, and who lets the bad guys kill lots of innocent humans just to make himself seem important; there's the love interest whose attempts to save the lead female's life are met with an arrogant &quot;stop trying to protect me, I can take care of myself!&quot; attitude, even though the lead female would be dead at this point if not for his intervention. Etc., etc., etc. The pale crazy guy from Armageddon and Con Air lends his voice to a role that's pretty much identical to his roles from those movies (not that this is a bad thing, mind you). I don't think there's one original character idea in this whole cast. On the &quot;writers obviously never went to Science class&quot; end, there's this whole &quot;earth spirit versus alien planet spirit&quot; bullcrap routine that you'd have to be on LSD to believe is even remotely possible without changing half of the known laws of physics.There is some good in this movie, however. The steady stream of increasingly bizarre and absurd revelations about the ghosts is quite entertaining, and the line about &quot;negotiating with extreme prejudice&quot; is alone worth whatever nausea you may or may not have felt during the rest of the movie. The character interaction and development isn't really bad per se, just lacking in the uniqueness area.Overall, it's not The English Patient, but then, it's not Swordfish either. I don't feel like I've wasted two hours of my life in watching this movie - actually, I'm probably better off having seen it, not because it made me a better person or anything, but because I got to see something really wierd and different, which is part of the whole point of art (which movies count as) in the first place. Also, it made me readjust my standards for which sci-fi premises are too much to swallow and which ones are not, thus letting me have a greater appreciation for stuff like The Fifth Element.",3,"Take with a grain - no, make that a pound - of salt",1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,2453,"['beginning', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'lot', 'potential', 'plot', 'started', 'out', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'wanted', 'very', 'much', 'learn', 'more', 'alien', 'creatures', 'However', 'end', 'had', 'basically', 'resorted', 'mix', 'horrible', 'generic', 'character', 'stereotypes', 'gross', 'negligence', 'laws', 'physics', 'quot', 'bad', 'character', 'stereotypes', 'quot', 'end', 'scientist', 'one', 'else', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'right', 'military', 'commando', 'guy', 'who', 'nuke', 'everything', 'listen', 'anyone', 'else', 'opinion', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'kill', 'lots', 'innocent', 'humans', 'just', 'make', 'seem', 'important', 'love', 'interest', 'attempts', 'save', 'lead', 'female', 'life', 'are', 'met', 'arrogant', 'quot', 'stop', 'trying', 'protect', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'myself', 'quot', 'attitude', 'even', 'lead', 'female', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'point', 'not', 'intervention', 'Etc.', 'etc.', 'etc', 'pale', 'crazy', 'guy', 'Armageddon', 'Con', 'Air', 'voice', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'identical', 'roles', 'movies', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'original', 'character', 'idea', 'whole', 'cast', 'quot', 'writers', 'obviously', 'never', 'went', 'Science', 'class', 'quot', 'end', 'whole', 'quot', 'spirit', 'versus', 'alien', 'planet', 'spirit', 'quot', 'routine', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'LSD', 'believe', 'even', 'remotely', 'possible', 'changing', 'half', 'known', 'laws', 'physics.There', 'good', 'movie', 'however', 'steady', 'stream', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'absurd', 'revelations', 'ghosts', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'line', 'quot', 'negotiating', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'quot', 'alone', 'worth', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'felt', 'rest', 'movie', 'character', 'interaction', 'development', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'se', 'just', 'lacking', 'uniqueness', 'area.Overall', 'not', 'English', 'Patient', 'then', 'not', 'Swordfish', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'wasted', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'watching', 'movie', 'actually', ""'m"", 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'having', 'seen', 'not', 'made', 'better', 'person', 'anything', 'got', 'see', 'something', 'really', 'wierd', 'different', 'part', 'whole', 'point', 'art', 'movies', 'count', 'first', 'place', 'Also', 'made', 'readjust', 'standards', 'sci-fi', 'premises', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'swallow', 'ones', 'are', 'not', 'thus', 'letting', 'have', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'stuff', 'Fifth', 'Element']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

Technically speaking, this was the most incredibly stunning film that I have ever seen. The financial losses suffered by this revolutionary masterpiece of film making were so great that Squaresoft had to close down their computer animation studio in Hawaii, laying off some of the most technically talented individuals ever assembled (from both USA and Japan). Although Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was not the first fully computer animated feature, it was the first to have such near photo-realistic CGI's - a degree of realism that approached 90%. The level of attention and care when it came to simulating light and shadow, human facial expressions, skin tone (including flecks), and individual strands of hair (with hair follicles) were extraordinary! Although I can understand the complaints voiced by the likes of Hollywood stars such as Tom Hanks about the possible threat to their livelihoods from photo-realistic CGI characters, I still feel their paranoia is unwarranted. CGI offers people yet another alternative in entertainment. People have the right to be entertained by whatever art forms they choose - the more diversity, the better. I mean let's not forget, you could forever admire a stunning CGI character (who never ages), but you can't ask it for it's autograph or shake its hand!

542697,A2GBNMYG9P9KCM,B00003CY5C,Ixx,"[3, 3]","Okay, before I begin, I liked this movie - a lot. However, while being a GREAT sci-fi movie, it was just lacking that Final Fantasy feel that the games tend to give off. It had very improper atmosphere. Anyway, let's get into this:Alright, the director of the games has been watching Aliens WAAAAY too much. The movie is often called Alien 5 by some of my friends. We're all total freaks of the Alien series, no we all naturally loved this movie. However, we're also huge Final Fantasy fans, and this movie was just way too Aliens for us to call Final Fantasy.Firstly, let's examine the plot itself, dealing with aliens from another unknown world that come and kill everyone off. That in itself sounds too familiar to the invasion colonly on LV-426.Character relations: the main character is, of course, a woman - with an alien infection inside her - kinda like Ripley and her Queen Alien infection. And that Grey character just popped Hicks into my mind right then. Then there's Neil, which basically Hudson with a dumber sense of humor and a high nasal voice. Oh and we CAN'T forget Ryan and Jane - a total ripoff of Sgt. Apone and Vasquez (Jane is THE biggest Vasquez ripoff I've ever seen.)Music relations - anyone who knows their Alien films also know that the composer for this movie is none other than Alien 3's Elliot Goldenthal. He even puts his famous orchestration sounds into the movie (remember the Chase Scene from Alien 3? Compare the music in that to Aki's Dream).Lemme see if I've missed anything... oh yeah! The nature of the creatures from both films is very similar. I even heard that the Phantoms were inspired by H.R. Giger, the Alien creature's creator. I might be wrong about this, but I've heard it flying around a few times. Also, the creatures have the same use of humans - the Phantoms infect a human upon touch with piece of a Phantom that eventually matures and overtakes the human body. The Xenomorph implants an embryo in the human body that matures and KILLS the human body. Striking similarity there....Okay I'm through ranting about Aliens. Now I'll go quickly into what the movie was missing that would have made it more Final Fantasy and less Aliens.-Where the HELL are the Chocobos and Moogles!!?? They at LEAST could have put ONE of them in there! Seeing a Chocobo on someone's SHIRT doesn't COUNT, man! That's WAY too far off. They could have put ONE Chocobo in there.(A few people have said that there's a Phantom in the later scenes modeled directly after a Chocobo, but I don't believe it, personally)-Why does it take place on Earth? I think that was A HUGE mistake, because it severely limits their possibilities in terms of plot and creativity. All the FF's have taken place in their own little universe that has nothing to do with Earth.-Why didn't Nobuo Umetsu compose the music? That would have added a lot to it.-Almost all of the FF's have some kind of cameo appearence by a character, place, event, etc. Like the scene in FF Tactics with Aeris and Cloud, as an obvious example. The movie had none of that, to my dismay. I was hoping that in that meeting room, I'd see Cloud or Seifer, Terra, Tristam, or Ramza and Delita. I DID see Sakaguchi there, but he's VERY difficult to make out.-Signature characters didn't make an appearence, like the frequent Biggs and Wedge duo, for example. They could very well have made them a part of the Deep Eyes Team!!You know what I thought would have been cool is if they put Tristam and Reuben (From Mystic Quest) as Deep Eyes members. I really liked both of those characters.As a grand total, I give this movie 3 out of 5 for being an awesome Alien 5 movie, but a [bad] Final Fantasy movie",3,"ALIENS, anyone?!",1013385600,"02 11, 2002",2002,3679,"['Okay', 'begin', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'However', 'being', 'GREAT', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'lacking', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'feel', 'games', 'tend', 'give', 'off', 'had', 'very', 'improper', 'atmosphere', 'Anyway', 'let', 'get', 'Alright', 'director', 'games', 'been', 'watching', 'Aliens', 'WAAAAY', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'often', 'called', 'Alien', '5', 'friends', ""'re"", 'total', 'freaks', 'Alien', 'series', 'naturally', 'loved', 'movie', 'However', ""'re"", 'also', 'huge', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'fans', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'Aliens', 'call', 'Final', 'Fantasy.Firstly', 'let', 'examine', 'plot', 'dealing', 'aliens', 'unknown', 'world', 'come', 'kill', 'everyone', 'off', 'too', 'familiar', 'invasion', 'colonly', 'LV-426.Character', 'relations', 'main', 'character', 'course', 'woman', 'alien', 'infection', 'kinda', 'Ripley', 'Queen', 'Alien', 'infection', 'Grey', 'character', 'just', 'popped', 'Hicks', 'mind', 'right', 'then', 'Then', 'Neil', 'basically', 'Hudson', 'dumber', 'sense', 'humor', 'high', 'nasal', 'voice', 'Oh', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'forget', 'Ryan', 'Jane', 'total', 'ripoff', 'Sgt', 'Apone', 'Vasquez', 'Jane', 'THE', 'biggest', 'Vasquez', 'ripoff', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Music', 'relations', 'anyone', 'who', 'Alien', 'films', 'also', 'know', 'composer', 'movie', 'none', 'other', 'Alien', '3', 'Elliot', 'Goldenthal', 'even', 'famous', 'orchestration', 'movie', 'remember', 'Chase', 'Scene', 'Alien', '3', 'Compare', 'music', 'Aki', 'Dream', 'Lem', 'see', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'anything', 'oh', 'yeah', 'nature', 'creatures', 'films', 'very', 'similar', 'even', 'heard', 'Phantoms', 'were', 'inspired', 'H.R', 'Giger', 'Alien', 'creature', 'creator', 'might', 'be', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'flying', 'few', 'times', 'Also', 'creatures', 'have', 'same', 'use', 'humans', 'Phantoms', 'infect', 'human', 'touch', 'piece', 'Phantom', 'eventually', 'human', 'body', 'Xenomorph', 'embryo', 'human', 'body', 'KILLS', 'human', 'body', 'Striking', 'similarity', 'there', '.Okay', ""'m"", 'ranting', 'Aliens', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'go', 'quickly', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'missing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'less', 'Aliens.-Where', 'HELL', 'are', 'Chocobos', 'Moogles', 'LEAST', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'ONE', 'Seeing', 'Chocobo', 'someone', 'SHIRT', ""n't"", 'COUNT', 'man', 'WAY', 'too', 'far', 'off', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'ONE', 'Chocobo', 'there', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'Phantom', 'later', 'scenes', 'modeled', 'directly', 'Chocobo', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'personally', '-Why', 'take', 'place', 'Earth', 'think', 'was', 'HUGE', 'mistake', 'severely', 'possibilities', 'terms', 'plot', 'creativity', 'FF', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'own', 'little', 'universe', 'nothing', 'do', 'Earth.-Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Nobuo', 'Umetsu', 'compose', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'lot', 'it.-Almost', 'FF', 'have', 'kind', 'cameo', 'appearence', 'character', 'place', 'event', 'etc', 'scene', 'FF', 'Tactics', 'Aeris', 'Cloud', 'obvious', 'example', 'movie', 'had', 'none', 'dismay', 'was', 'hoping', 'meeting', 'room', ""'d"", 'see', 'Cloud', 'Seifer', 'Terra', 'Tristam', 'Ramza', 'Delita', 'DID', 'see', 'Sakaguchi', 'there', 'VERY', 'difficult', 'make', 'out.-Signature', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'appearence', 'frequent', 'Biggs', 'Wedge', 'duo', 'example', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'made', 'part', 'Deep', 'Eyes', 'Team', 'know', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'put', 'Tristam', 'Reuben', 'From', 'Mystic', 'Quest', 'Deep', 'Eyes', 'members', 'really', 'liked', 'characters.As', 'grand', 'total', 'give', 'movie', '3', '5', 'being', 'awesome', 'Alien', '5', 'movie', '[', 'bad', ']', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'movie']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

The glimmer in a character's eye; the freckles on the left cheek; the tapping of a finger against a hip; the raised eybrow while in the midst of sexual tension.  But &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, while solid in its sci-fi storyline, lacks something. And this reviewer just can't put his finger on it.  This is a story about the phantoms in a lost world that invade another, searching for life---in death.  Through cohesive action, a group of scientists and military men (coupled with an evil control freak who ultimately destroys himself) try to find out what these spirits want and how to end the destruction that they are inflicting to so many. Throw in a weak love story and the value of friendship, trust, and science, and you've got the basic gist of the movie. But to be honest, I found too much drama in the plot.  Or was that the slowness of plot and movement in character speech?  While I admired the good &quot;acting&quot; that displays so much human emotion and allows the viewer to respect the friendships and sacrifice that revolve in this story, I did, however, find it a bit morbid and somber---something that the playful sci-fi fan in me did not really hope to encounter in viewing the first digital animated movie.  It could have been more upbeat.  But perhaps it is the themes of the movie: science, war, and loyalty.  I guess these are serious themes in themselves.

This was based on the hit video game franchise of the same name, although the movie took a more sci-fi approach as apposed to the more high fantasy that most of the earlier games.Taking place on a post-apocalyptic Earth(that's right, not Ivalice!)in the mid-21st Century, Aki Ross is a scientist who is trying to collect eight seperate spirits, which when combined will create an energy field that will rid the planet of an alien force. The invaders are creatures referred to as Phantoms, which are ghostlike monsters that literally suck the souls out of people. This happened after a meteor crashed on Earth decades earlier, and the Phantoms spread throughout the world and killed off most of the humans. The survivors live in specially shielded cities, who have built a giant oribiting cannon to blast the alien meteorite and save the planet. But Sid, the scientist who created the special Phantom-proof shields, realizes that this might cause the aliens' spirit to take over the Earth's spirit known as Gaia, which would destroy all life. Sid along with Aki are enlisted the help of the special military squad of Deep Eyes, the commander of which is Aki's old boyfriend, Gray.  They try to find the remaining spirits, however the vengeful General Hein is plotting to destroy the Phantoms at any cost.The Spirits Within was the precursor to several other computer animated films that attempted to have the characters(human or otherwise)appear as real as possible, such as Beowulf, Kaena: The Prophecy, Resident Evil: Degeneration, and Negadon. The animation was virtually years ahead of its time, which might have worked towards its disadvantage as some people were possibly just not ready for that kind of advancement in cinema. Granted, it might seem pretty common by today's standards, but when this came out in 2001 it was groundbreaking, and even busts the chops of some of the more recent digital animation.Of course the biggest gripe most people had was that it had very little to do with any of the actual Final Fantasy games. Most fans of the series expected guys with gravity-defying hair riding on Chocobos and swinging colossally huge swords around. However, the movie offered a compelling sci-fi/action/drama which managed to incorporate most of the better attributes that the games had, mainly brilliant character development and a compelling plot. It truly is an exceptionally great film, and worth a second look for those who are willing to see past the fanboy hatred.",5,CGI Animation Done Right!,1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,2636,"['Long', 'before', 'James', 'Cameron', 'started', 'pimping', 'Avatar', 'epic', 'Square', 'pioneered', 'world', 'first', 'full-length', 'photorealistic', 'CGI', 'animated', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'hit', 'video', 'game', 'franchise', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'took', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'approach', 'apposed', 'more', 'high', 'fantasy', 'most', 'earlier', 'games.Taking', 'place', 'post-apocalyptic', 'Earth', 'right', 'not', 'Ivalice', 'mid-21st', 'Century', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'scientist', 'who', 'trying', 'collect', 'eight', 'seperate', 'spirits', 'when', 'combined', 'will', 'create', 'energy', 'field', 'will', 'rid', 'planet', 'alien', 'force', 'invaders', 'are', 'creatures', 'referred', 'Phantoms', 'are', 'ghostlike', 'monsters', 'literally', 'suck', 'souls', 'people', 'happened', 'meteor', 'crashed', 'Earth', 'decades', 'earlier', 'Phantoms', 'spread', 'world', 'killed', 'off', 'most', 'humans', 'survivors', 'live', 'specially', 'shielded', 'cities', 'who', 'have', 'built', 'giant', 'oribiting', 'cannon', 'blast', 'alien', 'meteorite', 'save', 'planet', 'Sid', 'scientist', 'who', 'created', 'special', 'Phantom-proof', 'shields', 'might', 'cause', 'aliens', 'spirit', 'take', 'over', 'Earth', 'spirit', 'known', 'Gaia', 'would', 'destroy', 'life', 'Sid', 'Aki', 'are', 'enlisted', 'help', 'special', 'military', 'squad', 'Deep', 'Eyes', 'commander', 'Aki', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'Gray', 'try', 'find', 'remaining', 'spirits', 'however', 'vengeful', 'General', 'Hein', 'plotting', 'destroy', 'Phantoms', 'cost.The', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'was', 'precursor', 'several', 'other', 'computer', 'animated', 'films', 'attempted', 'have', 'characters', 'human', 'otherwise', 'appear', 'as', 'real', 'possible', 'such', 'Beowulf', 'Kaena', 'Prophecy', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Degeneration', 'Negadon', 'animation', 'was', 'virtually', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'towards', 'disadvantage', 'people', 'were', 'possibly', 'just', 'not', 'ready', 'kind', 'advancement', 'cinema', 'Granted', 'might', 'seem', 'pretty', 'common', 'today', 'standards', 'when', 'came', 'out', '2001', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'even', 'chops', 'more', 'recent', 'digital', 'animation.Of', 'course', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'most', 'people', 'had', 'was', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'games', 'Most', 'fans', 'series', 'expected', 'guys', 'gravity-defying', 'hair', 'riding', 'Chocobos', 'swinging', 'colossally', 'huge', 'swords', 'However', 'movie', 'offered', 'compelling', 'sci-fi/action/drama', 'managed', 'incorporate', 'most', 'better', 'games', 'had', 'mainly', 'brilliant', 'character', 'development', 'compelling', 'plot', 'truly', 'exceptionally', 'great', 'film', 'second', 'look', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'see', 'fanboy', 'hatred']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

I'll tell you what I found cool and what I found to be lacking. First off, I saw this movie in a digital projection theater. The colors were mind-blowing to say the least. I was constantly losing track of the story because I couldn't take my focus off the spectacular animation. The animation is so rich and textured...let's just say that you have never seen anything like it-real or fabricated. It truly is amazing. The voice casting is perfect. No slackers anywhere. The idea for the story is very innovative, not just some traditional sci-fi retread. But (and there always is a but), the actual dialogue and character development are lacking. Baldwin sometimes seems like a romantic distraction for Ming Na. Is Woods' character supposed to be a sympathetic bad guy because he talks about his family before he commits his bad deeds? Come on, I know 13-year-olds who don't fall for that. The question I was left with was: ""Why invest all this money in voice talent, if you give them nothing to work with?"" It's a testament to the actors that they were able to pull so much out of the dialogue considering what they had to work with. I don't want to give too much of the plot away, so I won't say anything else about it. ...I enjoyed all the characters for the most part, but I wish there was more to enjoy. I know sometimes that character development is lost because the studios want to get to the next big action event, but when people don't have anything invested in the characters, it just becomes a lot noise. It's too bad because, like I said, there was plenty of sources to draw upon.Bottom line: The best animation to date, but sorely lacking character and plot development.",3,"So much potential, but wasted...",1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,1843,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'reviews', 'movie', 'have', 'ranged', 'excellent', 'shoddy', 'mine', 'will', 'fall', 'middle', 'couple', 'reasons', 'will', 'get', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'found', 'cool', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'lacking', 'First', 'saw', 'movie', 'digital', 'projection', 'theater', 'colors', 'were', 'mind-blowing', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'constantly', 'losing', 'track', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'focus', 'spectacular', 'animation', 'animation', 'so', 'rich', 'textured', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'it-real', 'fabricated', 'truly', 'amazing', 'voice', 'casting', 'perfect', 'slackers', 'anywhere', 'idea', 'story', 'very', 'innovative', 'not', 'just', 'traditional', 'sci-fi', 'retread', 'always', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'lacking', 'Baldwin', 'sometimes', 'romantic', 'distraction', 'Ming', 'Na', 'Woods', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'bad', 'guy', 'family', 'bad', 'deeds', 'Come', 'know', '13-year-olds', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'question', 'was', 'left', 'was', 'Why', 'invest', 'money', 'voice', 'talent', 'give', 'nothing', 'work', 'testament', 'actors', 'were', 'able', 'pull', 'so', 'much', 'dialogue', 'considering', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'enjoy', 'know', 'sometimes', 'character', 'development', 'lost', 'studios', 'want', 'get', 'next', 'big', 'action', 'event', 'when', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'invested', 'characters', 'just', 'lot', 'noise', 'too', 'bad', 'said', 'was', 'plenty', 'sources', 'draw', 'upon.Bottom', 'line', 'best', 'animation', 'date', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'character', 'plot', 'development']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

Final Fantasy takes that step.  On the surface this movie may seem like a typical Sci Fi action movie, but when examined, there is a definite effort to make something more original.  The creators are more akin to making movies in the Japanese anime arena, this makes the movie different on two levels.  The first is the ground breaking animation.  Never before has computer animation looked so real and so textured.  The close ups of the actors, excuse me, the characters, allow you to see the texture of the skin.  It's flawless skin, but flawless in a way that any actor wearing makeup on camera would look.  The second way is in the nature of the story.  Fans of the game will probably already know the origin of the creatures that have invaded the Earth, so there won't be any surprises for them, but the action and technological effects will keep their attention anyway.  The story is about a ravaged Earth, nearly destroyed by an invading group of aliens.  Humans have grouped together in high tech cities protected by force fields to keep the invaders out.  In an effort to stop the creatures, two initiatives have been taken.  A military project, led by a domineering and hateful General, voiced by James Woods (excellent as always) whose wife and child were killed by the aliens, and a scientific project led by two scientists, the lead character Dr. Aki Ross, a beautifully animated woman voiced by the equally beautiful Ming Na, and her mentor, voiced by Donald Sutherland.  The scientists are looking for a more passive solution because the Superlaser the military wants to use from orbit could hurt the Earths own spiritforce, plus they believe there is another reason for these creatures being on Earth rather than the popular belief of invasion.  As mystical as all this sounds, it is done very subtly.  As Aki tries to acquire the spirits of the earth creatures that will support her theory, time is running out.  The intertwined love story is not really necessary but it does add an emotional element.  The combination of mysticism and technology are common in many Japanimation films and this movie seems to want to make those themes seem more mature.  They do a very good job.  The movie is very entertaining, and deadly serious.  After a while, you tend to forget you are watching animated people though.  In all, Final Fantasy is an extremely impressive piece of work and will no doubt pave the way for future CGI movies.  The pace is a bit slow but it seems to be done on purpose in order to maintain it's seriousness.  Other than that, the combination of these elements make for a very different Science fiction adventure.  Hopefully, this will not be last time full CGI is used, if ever there is a serious Science Fiction movie that requires sets that are too large to build, or creatures to hard to interact with, we will see this kind of work done again.",4,This is something more original,1003622400,"10 21, 2001",2001,2992,"['something', 'be', 'said', 'when', 'movie', 'giant', 'step', 'direction', 'one', 'taken', 'before', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'step', 'surface', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'typical', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'action', 'movie', 'when', 'examined', 'definite', 'effort', 'make', 'something', 'more', 'original', 'creators', 'are', 'more', 'akin', 'making', 'movies', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'arena', 'movie', 'different', 'two', 'levels', 'first', 'ground', 'breaking', 'animation', 'Never', 'before', 'computer', 'animation', 'looked', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'textured', 'close', 'ups', 'actors', 'characters', 'allow', 'see', 'texture', 'skin', 'flawless', 'skin', 'flawless', 'way', 'actor', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'camera', 'would', 'look', 'second', 'way', 'nature', 'story', 'Fans', 'game', 'will', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'origin', 'creatures', 'have', 'invaded', 'Earth', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprises', 'action', 'technological', 'effects', 'will', 'keep', 'attention', 'anyway', 'story', 'ravaged', 'Earth', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'invading', 'group', 'aliens', 'Humans', 'have', 'grouped', 'together', 'high', 'tech', 'cities', 'protected', 'force', 'fields', 'keep', 'invaders', 'out', 'effort', 'stop', 'creatures', 'two', 'initiatives', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'military', 'project', 'led', 'domineering', 'hateful', 'General', 'voiced', 'James', 'Woods', 'excellent', 'always', 'wife', 'child', 'were', 'killed', 'aliens', 'scientific', 'project', 'led', 'two', 'scientists', 'lead', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'woman', 'voiced', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'Ming', 'Na', 'mentor', 'voiced', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'scientists', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'passive', 'solution', 'Superlaser', 'military', 'use', 'orbit', 'could', 'hurt', 'Earths', 'own', 'spiritforce', 'believe', 'reason', 'creatures', 'being', 'Earth', 'rather', 'popular', 'belief', 'invasion', 'As', 'mystical', 'done', 'very', 'subtly', 'Aki', 'acquire', 'spirits', 'earth', 'will', 'support', 'theory', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'intertwined', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'necessary', 'add', 'emotional', 'element', 'combination', 'mysticism', 'technology', 'are', 'common', 'many', 'Japanimation', 'films', 'movie', 'want', 'make', 'themes', 'seem', 'more', 'mature', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'deadly', 'serious', 'while', 'tend', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'animated', 'people', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'piece', 'work', 'will', 'doubt', 'pave', 'way', 'future', 'CGI', 'movies', 'pace', 'bit', 'slow', 'be', 'done', 'purpose', 'order', 'maintain', 'seriousness', 'Other', 'combination', 'elements', 'make', 'very', 'different', 'Science', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'full', 'CGI', 'used', 'ever', 'serious', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'movie', 'sets', 'are', 'too', 'large', 'build', 'creatures', 'hard', 'interact', 'will', 'see', 'kind', 'work', 'done', 'again']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

542711,A23VGBG17K5NJ3,B00003CY5C,John Nolley II,"[5, 6]","For most critics, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was a technical success but little else.  As these same critics have had neither the degree of exposure to the epic storylines of anime nor the Final Fantasy series of games that the indended audience did, their reaction was somewhat to be expected but entirely off the mark.Set in a near future on our own earth, the dystopian world of Final Fantasy is the result of an asteroid impact--but entirely unlike the scenarios of films like Armageddon or Deep Impact.  Instead, said asteroid carried with it invisible alien entities called ""Phantoms"" whose very touch is lethal to all life.The last holdouts of humanity must find a way to defeat the Phantoms without sacrificing the earth itself.  This is where the film likely lost most critics unfamiliar with the Gaia concept of a living earth, though most fans of the game series should be well inured to the idea.  For those familiar with the plots of anime and Japanese mythic video games, the film is quite fulfilling and entertaining.The film's visuals are indeed stunning, featuring ultra-realistic computer animation that makes every other CG film look like poorly-drawn cartoons.  The voice cast, too, is of superior caliber, from Donald Sutherland to Alec Baldwin.  Steve Buschemi's acting may leave some audience members groaning--but that certainly didn't seem to affect fans of any of his other films!The DVD includes a number of outstanding special features, from a series of additional audio tracks that range from an isolated score and commentary by the composer to directors' and even Japanese production staff.  Various proofing tests of the ultra-realistic animation are included, from a music video set to Michael Jackson's Thriller to models and wireframes.  The DVD-ROM includes the screenplay and much more as well.  This is one of the few DVD's that I have actually explored every single special feature--and the makers of the discs certainly don't think ""menus"" and ""scene selection"" are special features like so many DVD authors today.One could only ask that Nobuo Uematsu had done the score--yet Elliot Goldenthal delivers with a superb soundtrack accentuated by vocal tracks by Laura Fabian and Japanese pop group L'Arc en Ciel.Overall, I am exceptionally pleased by the result of this film and its DVD transfer.  Give the movie a try if you enjoy Final Fantasy games, anime, or simply want to experience the most realistic computer animation ever made as a full-length picture.",5,"Stunning, Mythic Storyline Delivers in Final Fantasy Style",1050364800,"04 15, 2003",2003,2505,"['most', 'critics', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'was', 'technical', 'success', 'little', 'else', 'same', 'critics', 'have', 'had', 'degree', 'exposure', 'epic', 'storylines', 'anime', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'series', 'games', 'indended', 'audience', 'did', 'reaction', 'was', 'somewhat', 'be', 'expected', 'entirely', 'mark.Set', 'near', 'future', 'own', 'earth', 'dystopian', 'world', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'result', 'asteroid', 'impact', 'entirely', 'scenarios', 'films', 'Armageddon', 'Deep', 'Impact', 'Instead', 'said', 'asteroid', 'carried', 'invisible', 'alien', 'entities', 'called', 'Phantoms', 'very', 'touch', 'lethal', 'life.The', 'last', 'holdouts', 'humanity', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'defeat', 'Phantoms', 'sacrificing', 'earth', 'where', 'film', 'likely', 'lost', 'most', 'critics', 'unfamiliar', 'Gaia', 'concept', 'living', 'earth', 'most', 'fans', 'game', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'inured', 'idea', 'familiar', 'plots', 'anime', 'Japanese', 'mythic', 'video', 'games', 'film', 'quite', 'fulfilling', 'entertaining.The', 'film', 'visuals', 'are', 'indeed', 'stunning', 'featuring', 'ultra-realistic', 'computer', 'animation', 'other', 'CG', 'film', 'look', 'poorly-drawn', 'cartoons', 'voice', 'cast', 'too', 'superior', 'caliber', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Steve', 'Buschemi', 'acting', 'may', 'leave', 'audience', 'members', 'groaning', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'affect', 'fans', 'other', 'films', 'DVD', 'number', 'outstanding', 'special', 'features', 'series', 'additional', 'audio', 'tracks', 'range', 'isolated', 'score', 'commentary', 'composer', 'directors', 'even', 'Japanese', 'production', 'staff', 'Various', 'proofing', 'tests', 'ultra-realistic', 'animation', 'are', 'included', 'music', 'video', 'set', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Thriller', 'models', 'wireframes', 'DVD-ROM', 'screenplay', 'much', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'few', 'DVD', 'have', 'actually', 'explored', 'single', 'special', 'feature', 'makers', 'discs', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'menus', 'scene', 'selection', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'so', 'many', 'DVD', 'authors', 'today.One', 'could', 'only', 'ask', 'Nobuo', 'Uematsu', 'had', 'done', 'score', 'yet', 'Elliot', 'Goldenthal', 'delivers', 'superb', 'soundtrack', 'accentuated', 'vocal', 'tracks', 'Laura', 'Fabian', 'Japanese', 'pop', 'group', ""L'Arc"", 'Ciel.Overall', 'am', 'exceptionally', 'pleased', 'result', 'film', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'Give', 'movie', 'try', 'enjoy', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'games', 'anime', 'simply', 'want', 'experience', 'most', 'realistic', 'computer', 'animation', 'ever', 'made', 'full-length', 'picture']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

Scientist Aki Ross races to save the Earth by capturing the 8 spirits that can stop the phantoms. The story gets deeper than that, though. I definitely enjoyed The Spirits Within.What did I like? First of all, the film is visually stunning and still holds up against the best today; for a movie over 10 years old, this is an amazing achievement. There is a lot of detail in the character models and the surroundings. The story is also deep and engaging. I enjoyed how they implemented the spirits and the fact that they state the Earth has a spirit of its own. There are plenty of thrills and action sequences, and I particularly enjoyed the evacuation sequence. I also enjoyed the music. The ending was visually stunning and musically enchanting.What did I dislike? Some of the voice actors/acting seemed out of place at times. This was only a very minor issue, though.Overall, I highly recommend Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.

I don't want to say that I was disappointed in the film, but I was surprised by its depth.  Compared to the depth of the Final Fantasy game series, this would be a pool for eight-year-olds.  Needless to say, fans of the game will probably not get what they're expecting.  What can you really expect out of movies these days though?  Look at the incredibly popular remake of You've Got Mail starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  That isn't exactly the kind of movie a genius would find interesting.  On the other hand, there are movies like Memento where the plot and presentation are like nothing I've seen before.  To be honest, I was expecting that from Final Fantasy and didn't get it.Story wise, Final Fantasy The Spirits Within is  in the middle of the spectrum, smart but not deep.  The special effects really enchance it, though.  The whole story just works better with the computer generated characters.  Although the story, is no award-winner, it makes watching it for the special effects even better.

542732,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B00003CY5C,Lesley Aeschliman,"[3, 4]","Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a science fiction film by Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of the Final Fantasy role-playing games.  This film was the first attempt to make a photorealistic rendered 3D feature film, and was released to theaters in the United States on July 11, 2001.  Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is only vaguely related to the Final Fantasy games.  Dr. Sid's Gaia theory (a lifeforce within the planet to which the spirits belong) is reminiscent of the Lifestream/Mako in Final Fantasy VII.  Also, Dr. Sid continues the tradition of having a character named ""Cid"" in the Final Fantasy games (although his name is spelled ""Sid"" instead of ""Cid"").The first disc in this set contains the film, theatrical trailers, and production notes.  The second disc includes two Easter eggs: one is for a storyboard of a scene that's not in the film, while the other shows what appears to be a physical bust of Aki that is digitized.  The documentary on the DVD runs for about half an hour, and it talks about the animation, an explanation of the Gaia theory, the process for the 3D animation, the audio, and the music.There are ""character files"" for Aki, Gray, Dr. Sid, Hein, Ryan, Jane, and Neil.  For each one, there is footage of the character with a robotic-sounding female voice-over who provides information on the character, as well as the lead animator and voice actor for that character.  The ""vehicle scale comparisons"" is in the same style as the ""character files,"" but instead covers the following vehicles: Bandit, Black Boa, and Quatro.  The ""Final Fantasy Shuffle"" allows you to re-edit the conference scene and to learn background information from the animators.  However, I couldn't quite figure out the point of this feature.  It appears you can only re-organize the footage from the film; there are no alternate angles to choose from.""Trailer Explorations"" talks about putting together the teaser and the trailer for the film.  ""The Gray Project"" is a five-and-a-half minute piece which shows some footage that was put together as they were figuring out the designs for the characters.  ""More Boards/Blasts"" has storyboards, footage from the film, and animatics mixed together.  ""Matte Art Explorations"" shows the various mattes the animators used.  ""Joke Outtakes"" are a series of ""bloopers"" that runs for almost two minutes.  ""Compositing Builds"" shows the details of all the animation elements for one scene in the film.The original opening that is included is very different from the scene that opened the film.  Aki's dream is different, Aki's design is different, and she also already knows what her reason for the dreams are.  Personally, I think the opening scene in the actual film is much better than this.  ""Aki's Dream"" takes all the footage of Aki's dreams and puts them together into one continuous piece.  ""DVD-ROM Content"" explains the DVD-ROM content on the DVD.  Also, there's a hidden video of the characters from the film dancing to an instrumental of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller.""The 3D animation in this film is very well done; there were times I had to remind myself the characters on the screen were animated, not real people.  The film has pacifist themes, and military solutions tend to be either futile or are only temporarily effective.  The film is also very pro-environment.  The film tells a decent story, and is worth adding to your DVD collection if you enjoy this kind of a science fiction story.",4,Incredible animation for its time,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,3462,"['Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Hironobu', 'Sakaguchi', 'creator', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'role-playing', 'games', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'attempt', 'make', 'photorealistic', 'rendered', '3D', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'United', 'States', 'July', '11', '2001', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'only', 'vaguely', 'related', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'games', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'Gaia', 'theory', 'lifeforce', 'planet', 'spirits', 'belong', 'reminiscent', 'Lifestream/Mako', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'Also', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'tradition', 'having', 'character', 'named', 'Cid', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'games', 'name', 'spelled', 'Sid', 'instead', 'Cid', '.The', 'first', 'disc', 'set', 'film', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'production', 'notes', 'second', 'disc', 'two', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'one', 'storyboard', 'scene', 'not', 'film', 'other', 'what', 'be', 'physical', 'bust', 'Aki', 'digitized', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'hour', 'animation', 'explanation', 'Gaia', 'theory', 'process', '3D', 'animation', 'audio', 'music.There', 'are', 'character', 'files', 'Aki', 'Gray', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'Hein', 'Ryan', 'Jane', 'Neil', 'one', 'footage', 'character', 'robotic-sounding', 'female', 'voice-over', 'who', 'information', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'lead', 'animator', 'voice', 'actor', 'character', 'vehicle', 'scale', 'comparisons', 'same', 'style', 'character', 'files', 'instead', 'following', 'vehicles', 'Bandit', 'Black', 'Boa', 'Quatro', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Shuffle', 're-edit', 'conference', 'scene', 'learn', 'background', 'information', 'animators', 'However', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'point', 'feature', 'can', 'only', 're-organize', 'footage', 'film', 'are', 'alternate', 'angles', 'choose', 'Trailer', 'Explorations', 'talks', 'putting', 'together', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'film', 'Gray', 'Project', 'five-and-a-half', 'minute', 'piece', 'footage', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'were', 'figuring', 'out', 'designs', 'characters', 'More', 'Boards/Blasts', 'storyboards', 'footage', 'film', 'animatics', 'mixed', 'together', 'Matte', 'Art', 'Explorations', 'various', 'animators', 'used', 'Joke', 'Outtakes', 'are', 'series', 'bloopers', 'almost', 'two', 'minutes', 'Compositing', 'Builds', 'details', 'animation', 'elements', 'one', 'scene', 'film.The', 'original', 'opening', 'included', 'very', 'different', 'scene', 'opened', 'film', 'Aki', 'dream', 'different', 'Aki', 'design', 'different', 'also', 'already', 'what', 'reason', 'dreams', 'are', 'Personally', 'think', 'opening', 'scene', 'actual', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'Aki', 'Dream', 'footage', 'Aki', 'dreams', 'together', 'one', 'continuous', 'piece', 'DVD-ROM', 'Content', 'DVD-ROM', 'content', 'DVD', 'Also', 'hidden', 'video', 'characters', 'film', 'dancing', 'instrumental', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Thriller', '3D', 'animation', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'were', 'times', 'had', 'remind', 'characters', 'screen', 'were', 'animated', 'not', 'real', 'people', 'film', 'pacifist', 'themes', 'military', 'solutions', 'tend', 'be', 'either', 'futile', 'are', 'only', 'temporarily', 'effective', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'pro-environment', 'film', 'decent', 'story', 'worth', 'adding', 'DVD', 'collection', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'science', 'fiction', 'story']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

In the face of things, the military are pushing for a violent solution: shooting the Zeus cannon upon the meteor crater left behind after the arrival of the phantoms. Meanwhile, scientists Dr. Sid (modelled after Donald Sutherland, and also voiced by him) and Aki are running out of time in their efforts to find &quot;all the spirits&quot; needed to come up with an antidote to neutralize the effect of the evil phantoms, with a major handicap: they face incredible oposition from the Earth's ruling Council and the military because they have no proof but their faith and their hard work backing their redemption theory.This animated flick will have you on the edge far more than most 2001 human-acted movies. The animation work put behind it is simply amazing: this movie raised the standard by which computer-animated movies are to be judged technically.

An asteroid falling to earth carries within it a host of phantom creatures that seem hell bent on destroying earthly life.  Civilization has been reduced to living in shielded enclaves, and it is only a matter of time before the planet becomes a haunted wasteland.  Aki Ross and her mentor, Dr. Sid, are working on the creation of a neutralizing 'wave' based on the eight basic phantom life forms.  General Hein does not trust Dr. Sid's theories about a Gaia, or planetary spirit, and wants to use a huge orbital laser cannon to destroy the original meteor, possible destroying the earth in the process.  The conflict between these points of view and their shattering effects on the planet are the meat of the film.Captain Gray Edwards, once Aki's lover, crystallizes this struggle between the material world of violent reaction and the spiritual world of growth and synthesis.  The film plays a bit like an evolved 'Starship Troopers.'  In many ways, it presents the same visual image, and deals with the same issues.  The problem for the director and the viewer is to get past the magnificent graphic work to experience the abiding spiritual faith that is its meaning.  Ironically, the film itself is a metaphor for the issues it expresses.It is almost futile to discuss the film's animation and design.  They are so far above what we are used to that the required superlatives sound trite.  In essence, the animation staff set out to create something that is even more real than life, and to a great extent, they have succeeded.  This hyperrealism, combined with an almost ballet like feeling of choreography create a sense of moment that makes this seem far more than an action film.  The overall animation is carefully balanced so as to keep the focus on the characters.  Even so, this film has such a sensory effect that the viewer is tempted to forget the plot and simply observe the screen.The primary DVD provides the film and a whole set of commentaries (directing crew, animation and staging, composer, and production staff), plus the usual trailers, etc.  In the special edition, a second disk adds an extensive 'Making of...' segment, the entire screenplay and some analysis of character, vehicle, and prop design.  Technically, this is an important film, despite its simplistic plot and characters.  For the first time, the definition of what is acting and what is animation is being challenged in a thought provoking fashion.",4,Simple Values - Spectacular Production,1028937600,"08 10, 2002",2002,2996,"[""'Final"", 'Fantasy', 'computer', 'game', 'gone', 'countless', 'versions', 'editions', 'Taken', 'whole', 'mythos', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'know', 'games', 'genre', 'clear', 'beginning', 'film', 'Sony', 'Hironbu', 'Sakaguchi', 'producer', 'director', 'writer', 'were', 'intent', 'topping', 'already', 'brilliant', 'history', 'graphic', 'accomplishments', 'sense', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'piece', 'history', 'making', 'first', 'film', 'startling', 'approximation', 'life', 'using', 'only', 'automation.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'asteroid', 'falling', 'earth', 'host', 'phantom', 'creatures', 'seem', 'hell', 'bent', 'destroying', 'earthly', 'life', 'Civilization', 'been', 'reduced', 'living', 'shielded', 'enclaves', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'planet', 'haunted', 'wasteland', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'mentor', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'are', 'working', 'creation', 'neutralizing', ""'wave"", 'based', 'eight', 'basic', 'phantom', 'life', 'forms', 'General', 'Hein', 'not', 'trust', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'theories', 'Gaia', 'planetary', 'spirit', 'use', 'huge', 'orbital', 'laser', 'cannon', 'destroy', 'original', 'meteor', 'possible', 'destroying', 'earth', 'process', 'conflict', 'points', 'view', 'shattering', 'effects', 'planet', 'are', 'meat', 'film.Captain', 'Gray', 'Edwards', 'once', 'Aki', 'lover', 'struggle', 'material', 'world', 'violent', 'reaction', 'spiritual', 'world', 'growth', 'synthesis', 'film', 'bit', 'evolved', ""'Starship"", 'Troopers', 'many', 'ways', 'same', 'visual', 'image', 'deals', 'same', 'issues', 'problem', 'director', 'viewer', 'get', 'magnificent', 'graphic', 'work', 'experience', 'abiding', 'spiritual', 'faith', 'meaning', 'Ironically', 'film', 'metaphor', 'issues', 'almost', 'futile', 'discuss', 'film', 'animation', 'design', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'what', 'are', 'used', 'required', 'superlatives', 'sound', 'trite', 'essence', 'animation', 'staff', 'set', 'out', 'create', 'something', 'even', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'great', 'extent', 'have', 'succeeded', 'hyperrealism', 'combined', 'almost', 'ballet', 'feeling', 'choreography', 'create', 'sense', 'moment', 'seem', 'far', 'more', 'action', 'film', 'overall', 'animation', 'carefully', 'balanced', 'so', 'keep', 'focus', 'characters', 'Even', 'so', 'film', 'sensory', 'effect', 'viewer', 'tempted', 'forget', 'plot', 'simply', 'observe', 'screen.The', 'primary', 'DVD', 'film', 'whole', 'set', 'commentaries', 'directing', 'crew', 'animation', 'staging', 'composer', 'production', 'staff', 'usual', 'trailers', 'etc', 'special', 'edition', 'second', 'disk', 'extensive', ""'Making"", 'segment', 'entire', 'screenplay', 'analysis', 'character', 'vehicle', 'prop', 'design', 'Technically', 'important', 'film', 'simplistic', 'plot', 'characters', 'first', 'time', 'definition', 'what', 'acting', 'what', 'animation', 'being', 'challenged', 'thought', 'provoking', 'fashion']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

This film was the first I had seen, where it is entirely CGI!! For some, it has become dated, because the computer field is constantly evolving, and with it, CGI special effects.I am not so critical of this film, because it IS entertaining. Yes, the story is weak, by some, but it does keep you interested, until the very end, when it becomes a bit quasi-religious. The idea of ""Ghosts"" is interesting, as is the idea of fighting them. The introduction of ""new"" technology is likewise interesting, as that is what science fiction is all about! Casting for the voice overs was well done!! Each is easily indentifiable, and they lend to the believability of it all.Since I am not a videogame player, the film stands on it's own merit, and for me, at least, the film works as an exceptional ""escapist reality""!!There are a mountain of special features on the second disc, that deal with the whole process of bringing ""Final Fantasy"" to the big screen (or the little screen, for that matter).

542740,AUOIOJ1CSPO99,B00003CY5C,Matt B.,"[2, 3]","This CGI film is a story of Aki Ross, a scientist working with fellow scientist Doctor Sid in year 2065 to free the Earth of an apparently deadly alien race called the Phantoms which has driven humanity to survive in cities under energy domes known as Barrier Cities. Aki and Sid are against General Hein, who wishes to fire the Zeus cannon from space to annihilate the Phantoms, while injuring the Earth's ""gaia"" or spirit in the process. This was the first film to attempt to create a photorealistic computer generated world with 3D characters and for the most part it succeeds with flying colors. This film is one of the most delicious films to look at for the characters are expressive and realistic and the effects and set pieces are magical and beautiful. The voice acting is great and the script is interesting, thought provoking, and entertaining.From the fantastical first few minutes of the film, I was immediately pulled into a sci-fi world that held so much eye candy I could barely stand it, seriously. The visuals are absolutely stunning and just looking at the screen, I wanted to see more. The action began at once and I assumed that the whole movie would be intense and action packed. But I didn't expect the movie would take to the typical Asian slow-paced storytelling as the movie progressed because the opening sequences were so incredibly awesome and engaging, though the story never got boring.The animation is excellent, especially the human movements. The character's faces however--well you know they aren't real humans. They are believable and lifelike, but the facial animations don't recreate those of a real human. It is never distracting though because there is just so much else to look at in the film. The female lead, Aki is beautifully done and her character is likable and watchable. In the story, Aki and Sid team up with the Deep Eyes, a group of military warriors to defend the survivors of this apparent alien invasion. They struggle to learn about these aliens and how they might be able to eliminate them. When General Hein comes into the picture, planning to blast the aliens away with the Zeus cannon, Aki and Doctor Sid warn him that doing so will injure the Earth's own spirit. General Hein does not believe this, and does not care because he is looking to kill these aliens out of revenge. The voices are well done by known American actors such as Alec Baldwin and Donald Sutherland to name a few.The story sometimes drags along at points, and just when you think the end is near, there's another thirty minutes to wrap things up. But it can be forgiven because it's thirty minutes more of glorious visuals and eye candy. Things never get too weird, either, like in some other Asian films, and it never gets too complicated. If it all seems complicated at first, it really isn't, if you read the main premise beforehand. Any problems with the story I found, the visuals totally made up for that. It was an amazing feat of a film Hironobu Sakaguchi made for its visuals alone. After the movie ended, I wished right away for another movie with similar technology to be made. There have been, but not to the exact degree of this one.Fans of the ""Final Fantasy"" video game series will most likely be disappointed by this film. It has nothing to do with the video games, and I am surprised it was titled as a Final Fantasy film. If you go into seeing the movie with no expectations then that is probably the best way to watch the movie. No, scratch that--you can expect an amazing, truly, truly amazing visual roller coaster, and an entertaining story to go with it on top. It is a very good film, and I loved seeing it, twice.8.9/10 stars",5,A Visual Ride,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,3681,"['CGI', 'film', 'story', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'scientist', 'working', 'fellow', 'scientist', 'Doctor', 'Sid', 'year', '2065', 'free', 'Earth', 'apparently', 'deadly', 'alien', 'race', 'called', 'Phantoms', 'driven', 'humanity', 'survive', 'cities', 'energy', 'domes', 'known', 'Barrier', 'Cities', 'Aki', 'Sid', 'are', 'General', 'Hein', 'who', 'fire', 'Zeus', 'cannon', 'space', 'annihilate', 'Phantoms', 'injuring', 'Earth', 'gaia', 'spirit', 'process', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'attempt', 'create', 'photorealistic', 'computer', 'generated', 'world', '3D', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'flying', 'colors', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'delicious', 'films', 'look', 'characters', 'are', 'expressive', 'realistic', 'effects', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'magical', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'acting', 'great', 'script', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'fantastical', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'immediately', 'pulled', 'sci-fi', 'world', 'held', 'so', 'much', 'eye', 'candy', 'could', 'barely', 'stand', 'seriously', 'visuals', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'just', 'looking', 'screen', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'action', 'began', 'once', 'assumed', 'whole', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'intense', 'action', 'packed', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'would', 'take', 'typical', 'Asian', 'slow-paced', 'storytelling', 'movie', 'progressed', 'opening', 'sequences', 'were', 'so', 'incredibly', 'awesome', 'engaging', 'story', 'never', 'got', 'boring.The', 'animation', 'excellent', 'especially', 'human', 'movements', 'character', 'however', 'well', 'know', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'humans', 'are', 'believable', 'lifelike', 'facial', 'animations', 'do', ""n't"", 'recreate', 'real', 'human', 'never', 'distracting', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'look', 'film', 'female', 'lead', 'Aki', 'beautifully', 'done', 'character', 'likable', 'watchable', 'story', 'Aki', 'Sid', 'team', 'up', 'Deep', 'Eyes', 'group', 'military', 'warriors', 'defend', 'survivors', 'apparent', 'alien', 'invasion', 'struggle', 'learn', 'aliens', 'how', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'eliminate', 'When', 'General', 'Hein', 'picture', 'planning', 'blast', 'aliens', 'away', 'Zeus', 'cannon', 'Aki', 'Doctor', 'Sid', 'warn', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'injure', 'Earth', 'own', 'spirit', 'General', 'Hein', 'not', 'believe', 'not', 'care', 'looking', 'kill', 'aliens', 'revenge', 'voices', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'known', 'American', 'actors', 'such', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'name', 'few.The', 'story', 'sometimes', 'along', 'points', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'end', 'near', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'more', 'glorious', 'visuals', 'eye', 'candy', 'Things', 'never', 'get', 'too', 'weird', 'either', 'other', 'Asian', 'films', 'never', 'too', 'complicated', 'complicated', 'first', 'really', ""n't"", 'read', 'main', 'premise', 'beforehand', 'problems', 'story', 'found', 'visuals', 'totally', 'made', 'up', 'was', 'amazing', 'feat', 'film', 'Hironobu', 'Sakaguchi', 'made', 'visuals', 'alone', 'movie', 'ended', 'wished', 'right', 'away', 'movie', 'similar', 'technology', 'be', 'made', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'exact', 'degree', 'one.Fans', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'video', 'game', 'series', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'video', 'games', 'am', 'surprised', 'was', 'titled', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'film', 'go', 'seeing', 'movie', 'expectations', 'then', 'probably', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'movie', 'No', 'scratch', 'can', 'expect', 'amazing', 'truly', 'truly', 'amazing', 'visual', 'roller', 'coaster', 'entertaining', 'story', 'go', 'top', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'loved', 'seeing', 'stars']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS
542741,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CY5C,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","Sometimes a movie isn't so easy to review. One reason can be that it doesn't fit the mold, and that's certainly the case with Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. It's animated, but it's not for kids. [Note the PG-13 rating.] It's animation, which is computer generated, is so high tech that it's almost photorealistic. Unlike Shrek or A Bug's Life, though, it's main characters aren't cartoon figures made lifelike. They are people - people generated by computers. They don't look entirely real, but they are startling enough to suggest a future in which Nicole Kidman or Julia Roberts could star in a movie without really being there at all. They could simply show up afterwards to do the voices.With the possible exception of Moulin Rouge [not yet on video]. Final Fantasy is the most visually stunning movie I have seen this year. If a movie can be art, then this one qualifies. If it can't, then this is still a major technological breakthrough. There have been lots of important advances over the years, such as Technicolor, Cinemascope, Cinerama, Panavision, digital stereo and IMAX. Each of them impressed audiences and increased business, at least until the novelty wore off. After a while audiences remembered a basic need, which is that of a story people want to see and hear. That need has not changed, and the makers of Final Fantasy, who spent four years and a reported 137 million dollars to create this newest frontier in movie making, learned the hard way that, if the story isn't all that good, people won't come to see the movie. To make matters worse, they weren't able to convince a young adult audience that an animated movie can be for them rather than for kids. It can be, but few viewers are yet buying the idea.It is the year 2064. Planet Earth has been invaded and conquered by creepy and often invisible beings. Life for people goes on, but only in cities protected under giant bubbles. Leave the city, and the aliens will definitely get you literally sucking out your spirit. As the movie opens, Dr. Aki Ross [voice of Ming-Na] is alone on a scientific expedition. Fortunately, she is rescued at the last moment by Capt. Gary Edwards [Alec Baldwin] and his crew. It turns out that Aki and Gary used to be lovers and are not at all happy to see each other. Everyone thinks Aki is crazy to have ventured out into the world, but she is actually working on an important project with Dr. Sid [Donald Sutherland]. They believe in the Gaia, the idea that our planet is composed of spirits. If they can find all eight of these spirits, they can force the aliens to leave. Most of the rest of humanity is putting its faith in the Zeus Project, a giant death ray in space built to destroy the asteroid the invaders arrived on. Aki and Dr. Sid are convinced that blowing it up will only make matters worse.So, here we are at my problem. I can't fault the artistry of the film. I will doubtless watch it again for its astounding visuals. I know the movie is based on a very successful series of video games. The concepts of looking for the spirits and for the Gaia are intriguing. So, why did the producers decide to use such an unimaginative space-opera script? It would seem like their enormous investment would have required a first-rate story. Whatever the case, the best I can do is to give it a mixed review.By the way, since the art of computer animation does not yet produce entirely believable human figures, Nicole and Julia will still need to report to the set for the next several years.",3,Glorious animation nearly overcomes uninspired script,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,3514,"['Sometimes', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'easy', 'review', 'One', 'reason', 'can', 'be', ""n't"", 'fit', 'mold', 'certainly', 'case', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'animated', 'not', 'kids', '[', 'Note', 'PG-13', 'rating', ']', 'animation', 'computer', 'generated', 'so', 'high', 'tech', 'almost', 'photorealistic', 'Shrek', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'though', 'main', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'cartoon', 'figures', 'made', 'lifelike', 'are', 'people', 'people', 'generated', 'computers', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'entirely', 'real', 'are', 'startling', 'enough', 'suggest', 'future', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'could', 'star', 'movie', 'really', 'being', 'could', 'simply', 'show', 'up', 'afterwards', 'do', 'voices.With', 'possible', 'exception', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', '[', 'not', 'yet', 'video', ']', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'art', 'then', 'one', 'qualifies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'then', 'still', 'major', 'technological', 'breakthrough', 'have', 'been', 'lots', 'important', 'advances', 'years', 'such', 'Technicolor', 'Cinemascope', 'Cinerama', 'Panavision', 'digital', 'stereo', 'IMAX', 'impressed', 'audiences', 'increased', 'business', 'least', 'novelty', 'wore', 'off', 'while', 'audiences', 'remembered', 'basic', 'need', 'story', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'hear', 'need', 'not', 'changed', 'makers', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'who', 'spent', 'four', 'years', 'reported', '137', 'million', 'dollars', 'create', 'newest', 'frontier', 'movie', 'making', 'learned', 'hard', 'way', 'story', ""n't"", 'good', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'see', 'movie', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'convince', 'young', 'adult', 'audience', 'animated', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'few', 'viewers', 'are', 'yet', 'buying', 'idea.It', 'year', '2064', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'been', 'invaded', 'conquered', 'creepy', 'often', 'invisible', 'beings', 'Life', 'people', 'only', 'cities', 'protected', 'giant', 'bubbles', 'Leave', 'city', 'aliens', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'literally', 'sucking', 'out', 'spirit', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Aki', 'Ross', '[', 'voice', 'Ming-Na', ']', 'alone', 'scientific', 'expedition', 'Fortunately', 'rescued', 'last', 'moment', 'Capt', 'Gary', 'Edwards', '[', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', ']', 'crew', 'out', 'Aki', 'Gary', 'used', 'be', 'lovers', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'see', 'other', 'Everyone', 'thinks', 'Aki', 'crazy', 'have', 'ventured', 'out', 'world', 'actually', 'working', 'important', 'project', 'Dr.', 'Sid', '[', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', ']', 'believe', 'Gaia', 'idea', 'planet', 'composed', 'spirits', 'can', 'find', 'eight', 'spirits', 'can', 'force', 'aliens', 'leave', 'Most', 'rest', 'humanity', 'putting', 'faith', 'Zeus', 'Project', 'giant', 'death', 'ray', 'space', 'built', 'destroy', 'asteroid', 'invaders', 'arrived', 'Aki', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'are', 'convinced', 'blowing', 'up', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'matters', 'worse.So', 'here', 'are', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'artistry', 'film', 'will', 'doubtless', 'watch', 'again', 'astounding', 'visuals', 'know', 'movie', 'based', 'very', 'successful', 'series', 'video', 'games', 'concepts', 'looking', 'spirits', 'Gaia', 'are', 'intriguing', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'producers', 'decide', 'use', 'such', 'unimaginative', 'space-opera', 'script', 'would', 'seem', 'enormous', 'investment', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'first-rate', 'story', 'case', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'give', 'mixed', 'review.By', 'way', 'art', 'computer', 'animation', 'not', 'yet', 'produce', 'entirely', 'believable', 'human', 'figures', 'Nicole', 'Julia', 'will', 'still', 'need', 'report', 'set', 'next', 'several', 'years']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

542747,A18E6KS6HEVJI1,B00003CY5C,Mike Neimoyer,"[2, 2]","Think you know what the movie is about, just from the trailer? Dead wrong. 90% of the stuff in the trailer is from the first thirty minutes of the movie. And this film is almost 2 hours long.Which means that you've got a ton of movie to watch.The storyline is good, but there were points that I was hoping for more back-story. I did like the revelation about the phantoms and why they're here, though it didn't provide enough information for me to understand their M.O. The film clips along at a good pace, though, and you truly get to feeling for the human characters along the way. In fact, the woman next to me started snuffling when one of the ""Deep Eyes"" team is killed in action against the phantoms.The digital effects of the phantoms are stunning, and truly creepy. There's a huge myriad of phantom forms... everything from flying ""dragons"" to human-sized, to ""meta"" forms: huge, lumbering, sinister-looking, and utterly deadly. One mere brush against a phantom is enough to infect a human and kill him. If that isn't scary... the phantoms are capable of ripping your very spirit from your body... leaving your physical shell to drop like so much dead weight. Worse still, this process is extremely disturbing, and frighteningly quick (and could possibly spook young children)The CGI rendering throughout the film is eye-candy of the highest order. There are a few moments where you can tell that one or two characters were rendered at the beginning of the project; they're a bit stiff, and a little too obviously CGI. However, the animation for Dr. Ross (voiced by Ming-Na) and Capt. Gray (Alec Baldwin) are incredible. The animation on Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland) is so life-like I had to remind myself at a couple of junctions that he's CGI; he had some very human mannerisms.The voice-acting is top-notch, something you'd expect from a cast of this caliber. And the interplay between Ving Rhames, Peri Gilpin, and Steve Buscemi sounded so natural, it's difficult to believe that they weren't recorded all together in the same room. Of all the voice-actors, I'd have to give the least amount of credit to James Wood, for his turn as General Hein, the vengeance-obsessed military strategist. He was too wooden, IMO. Donald Sutherland's performance was stellar, and his subtle intonations fit the character perfectly.The ending.... Well, it's certainly a Final Fantasy ending; a balance of the melancholic and optimistic. I didn't quite see the ending coming, but I felt that it was right none-the-less.The story is good; it's not superb. The characters are likeable (and at times,... funny), but there's a few problems with visually disparate rendering. The real treat here is the sheer scope of this project, and the sheer immensity of the visions you are part of. All in all, I'm going back to see it. I'll happily give them my money to see this amount of eye-candy again. It's amazing to see the technology pushed so far. I can't wait to see what they do for an encore.PS - Do not get up from your seat, until the credits start to roll. There's a hauntingly beautiful track that plays over the last few minutes of the film, and the beginning of the credits. It's beautiful.",4,"""Final Fantasy"" thoughts - Spoiler Free",1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,3186,"['Think', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'just', 'trailer', 'Dead', 'wrong', '90', '%', 'stuff', 'trailer', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'film', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'long.Which', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ton', 'movie', 'watch.The', 'storyline', 'good', 'were', 'points', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'back-story', 'did', 'revelation', 'phantoms', 'why', ""'re"", 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'enough', 'information', 'understand', 'M.O', 'film', 'clips', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'truly', 'get', 'feeling', 'human', 'characters', 'way', 'fact', 'woman', 'started', 'snuffling', 'when', 'one', 'Deep', 'Eyes', 'team', 'killed', 'action', 'phantoms.The', 'digital', 'effects', 'phantoms', 'are', 'stunning', 'truly', 'creepy', 'huge', 'myriad', 'phantom', 'forms', 'everything', 'flying', 'dragons', 'human-sized', 'meta', 'forms', 'huge', 'lumbering', 'sinister-looking', 'utterly', 'deadly', 'One', 'mere', 'brush', 'phantom', 'enough', 'infect', 'human', 'kill', ""n't"", 'scary', 'phantoms', 'are', 'capable', 'ripping', 'very', 'spirit', 'body', 'leaving', 'physical', 'shell', 'drop', 'so', 'much', 'dead', 'weight', 'Worse', 'still', 'process', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'frighteningly', 'quick', 'could', 'possibly', 'spook', 'young', 'children', 'CGI', 'rendering', 'film', 'eye-candy', 'highest', 'order', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'were', 'rendered', 'beginning', 'project', ""'re"", 'bit', 'stiff', 'little', 'too', 'obviously', 'CGI', 'However', 'animation', 'Dr.', 'Ross', 'voiced', 'Ming-Na', 'Capt', 'Gray', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'are', 'incredible', 'animation', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'so', 'life-like', 'had', 'remind', 'couple', 'junctions', 'CGI', 'had', 'very', 'human', 'mannerisms.The', 'voice-acting', 'top-notch', 'something', ""'d"", 'expect', 'cast', 'caliber', 'interplay', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Peri', 'Gilpin', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'sounded', 'so', 'natural', 'difficult', 'believe', 'were', ""n't"", 'recorded', 'together', 'same', 'room', 'voice-actors', ""'d"", 'have', 'give', 'least', 'amount', 'credit', 'James', 'Wood', 'turn', 'General', 'Hein', 'vengeance-obsessed', 'military', 'strategist', 'was', 'too', 'wooden', 'IMO', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'performance', 'was', 'stellar', 'subtle', 'intonations', 'fit', 'character', 'perfectly.The', 'ending', 'Well', 'certainly', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'ending', 'balance', 'melancholic', 'optimistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'felt', 'was', 'right', 'none-the-less.The', 'story', 'good', 'not', 'superb', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'times', 'funny', 'few', 'problems', 'visually', 'disparate', 'rendering', 'real', 'treat', 'here', 'sheer', 'scope', 'project', 'sheer', 'immensity', 'visions', 'are', 'part', ""'m"", 'going', 'back', 'see', ""'ll"", 'happily', 'give', 'money', 'see', 'amount', 'eye-candy', 'again', 'amazing', 'see', 'technology', 'pushed', 'so', 'far', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'do', 'encore.PS', 'Do', 'not', 'get', 'up', 'seat', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'track', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'beginning', 'credits', 'beautiful']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

But the similarities between the movie and the video games end there, the story of &quot;The Spirits Within&quot; revolves around a race of alien spirits called the Phantoms who have crashed on Earth and have the ability to take a person's spirit, causing the planet to become a wasteland and sending humanity on the brink of extinction.

James Woods is exceptional as General Hein, a hell-bent for revenge soldier willing to go to any cost to destroy the Phantoms.  The animation is undescribable, Aki (voiced by Ming-Na), and Dr. Sid (voiced by Donald Sutherland), look so real they could almost pass for real actors.

I marveled at the production, and kept commenting to my wife throughout the movie how amazingly realistic the animation was.  The entire movie, as nearly as I could tell, was computer generated, but there are occasions when you will swear you're looking at live actors.  &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; meets the microchip.The plot centers around a futuristic New York City which, along with the rest of the world, has been devastated by ghostly alien invaders who literally devour the spirits of any living creature they touch.  This feature makes for some very disturbing scenes as various characters meet their respective demises.  The protagonist is an attractive scientist whose mission is to find and gather eight living spirits from around the world to complete an energy wave to destroy the invaders.  She spends most of the movie teamed with a buff commando captain (voiced by Alec Baldwin), who provides cover fire as she goes about her task.  Needless to say, some romantic energy develops over the course of the story, but you would expect no less.Meanwhile, the &quot;bad guys&quot; include not only the very dangerous space critters, but also a maniacal general who wants to prove that his big guns are more than a match for the aliens, and he's willing to risk everything to make his point.  Overall, I thought the story line was engaging if a little predictable.  There were a number of wonderfully suspenseful scenes, and several great depictions of valor and self sacrifice.  Again, though, the most gripping aspect of this movie is its stunning visual appearance.  Extremely well done and entertaining.",4,Impressive!

There were of course technical/graphic image things that were similar to the advanced displays of the Matrix short, made years later.But this actually went into having a plot and humanization (if such a word exists).  The main deficit to this form of design seems to be the effort to make younger people appear perfect.  Dr. Sid tends to look the best because he has wrinkles and frown lines.  Thats mainly my visual critique.  Its apparent that this computer rendering is much cheaper than physically trying to create these images and can be done on a much grander scale.The plot, was pretty good too.  Though I still don't get the Spirit Hunt----that part of the metaphysical science is left a little vague.  And the fact that their hypothesis is doubted, is honestly right.  How the spirits of some animals and vegetation on Earth are special versuses saythose of other living people is not fully answered so that this group of people can risk their lives.  The concept of teh Phantoms being a cosmic accident and not an invasion was original but I thought it a little slow that no on eelse thought of them as ghosts beforehand.  What I'm mainly saying is that a lot of these plot points took a back stage to the computer elements and most importantly there being a sense that more than a handful of people on the entire planet had the ability to think.

This DVD comes loaded down with Features for all you techno geeks at heart too play and fiddle around with.  just check out the list and drool if that sorta thing is your bag.  But for the rest of us that don't have a clue what a animorphic widescreen is.... Were more interested in what kind of film this is.Well... It's a real good one.  Better then Mummy returns in many respects.  I'm sure you've read the poor reviews, and let me explain why.Quick Question: You ever go too a film and sit behind a guy that talks and doesn't pay attention too a film?  That's the kind of guy that won't enjoy this film.  It's a sad fact that The majority of Western audiances wanna go too a movie and be able too get the plot whilst paying minimal attention.  And most movies, (Gladiator, mummy returns) Cater too this mentality.Final Fantasy's story movies quickly, not a scene is wasted, nor is one piece of dialouge.  Blink, go too the bathroom, and you will not have the slightist idea whats going on, or why the ppl are doing what they are doing.  I'm sad that the film got a bad rap by ppl that prefer simplicity.  While simplicity has it's place, A film like this is a breathtaking break from the norm.When I Rented the film for a friend, in the first scene they asked me &quot;I thought this is supposed too be animated, how come they are using a real actress in that scene&quot;  Well, It is 100% completely animated.  And that's the kicker.  It's the most visually dazzeling film you ever saw.  Lucas said that he wanted too put a life like CGI alien in Phantom menace,  Well lucas I reccommend you take your Gungan Back too the old workshop cuz he looks like a hand puppet compared too the charachters in this film.  Acting and dialouge all get A+ marks all around.  The only exception is general Hein.  When the heck did Snidely Whiplash sign up with Square anyway?  I swear there is a distinct resemblance.  Maybe Hanna Barbara should sue.  General Hein Gets a B instead cuz he's just so over the top and dastardly that Dr. Evil would have too clone a thousand Mini Me's just too be competitive.In short, final fantasy Is top notch, yet Complex entertainment that demands your complete attention, and perhaps multiple viewings too truly enjoy.  And even if you have the attention span with the tinsel strength of cotton candy in a typhoon, If your a techno-geek, you'll just dig all those extras.  The biggest sin is that fianl fantasy was so underappreciated at the box office that square recently announced they will make no more feature films due too the EXTREME lack of profit.  Which is a shame.

542768,A2TYSWTM5MSEXZ,B00003CY5C,Pedro Lpez,"[0, 0]","I rated this movie this way as I would have rated any other movie, it is a science fiction-fantasy movie. The story has some original elements, but it's another apocalyptic scenario, with humanity facing anhihilation. It clearly borrows some action scenes from James Cameron's Aliens, the director must be a fan of it. It is though a very entertaining, thrilling, suspenseful movie. What sets it apart it's the fact that is entirely CG, and the characters are human like, not smiley cartoons, thanks a lot for that, at last somebody did it, no toys, no ogres, no ants, no dinosaurs, not that I didn't like'em, I did, but this movie dares to go further, and makes the other CG movies producers look as if they have been cowering from taking the next step. It isn't a kids movie, it is dark, a bit sad, and characters die, good guys! The characters, well, are the most realistic CG humans to date, and can convey human emotions, not just humor. I hope they make virtual actors out of them, so we can see them in other movies, it will be great to see Aki again even if it isn't a FF sequel, she could even turn into a model, make TV ads for any hair treatment brand.

542770,A2N5QMIZROR30U,B00003CY5C,"""quizkid82""","[0, 1]","&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; is quite the technical achievement, and a very intriguing movie to watch. It plays to me like an Americanized anime complete with a male lead that looks like Ben Affleck (though with the voice of Alec Baldwin). It's an enjoyable viewing experience despite some iffy dialogue and some slow spots.But does the DVD live up to the film, breaking barriers and being a technological wonder? Well, not quite. Sure, there are plenty of extras here, but they're not that useful. Many of them simply involve looking at animatics or storyboards, something that seems pointless when you're dealing with an animated movie. It's animated, the whole thing is &quot;drawn.&quot; Why do we need to see storyboards?Anyways, there's also the documentary, which seems lacking in many areas (not the least of which being the absolutely awful music that plays throughout it). There's almost no focus on the voice talent, and you never really get a sense of how this movie is made; it's a bunch of talking heads. Of course, this DVD comes on the heels of the outstanding &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; package, so I guess anything will seem lame by comparison.Then there's this editing feature, where you can shuffle a scene to your own liking. I couldn't understand how to do it, I don't know about you. When your DVD feature needs and instruction book, it's not a good feature, if you ask me.Then there's the picture quality, which I must say is rather lacking considering it's been taken directly from the digital source material.

I still feel that it was a nice attempt and sadly it probably was just a movie that was released to early in the movie world.

542780,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00003CY5C,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","This review is for the two disc special edition of the Oct/2001 animated film Final Fantasy.A film that never made its creating costs,it nevertheless is a very compelling piece of animation that still to this day holds up very well.At first glance the plot can be a little heavy at times as it gets too detail oriented and even the premise(Gaia and the spirit concept)can even be a little off putting to some.But it is a film that can be scrutinized again and again,as each time you see something a little different.It was a Japanese(inspired and directed)/American co production and features the voices of Donald Sutherland,Ving Rhames,Alec Baldwin,James Wood,Steve Buschemi and others.The story involves the Earth of 2065 now dotted with encased cities.They are under constant threat by a variety of ethereal type entities called Phantoms,who,with just a slight touch,can kill a man by taking his very essence.The film opens as one Aki-Ross is scouring the old open city of New York for a plant which is one of eight spirits needed to defeat the Phantoms.At that same time some troopers drop in on reconnaissance and luckily for Aki,end up saving her life as the Phantoms start attacking.It turns out Aki had a relationship with the head trooper and as the movie progresses the two end up reconnecting.Aki works for a Professor Sid and from here on in the troopers,Aki and the professor will work together to collect the other spirits.However not all are happy with the spirits or Gaia theory that the professor expounds.In fact General Hein wants to use an orbiting dynamo to wipe out the main cluster of Phantoms in Russia.Both sides give their arguments at a hearing with the current administration and the professor and company buy some time.Eventually however the domed city is attacked and an over confident Gen.Hein recklesly allows the Phantoms access but is unable to contain the threat and they overrun the city.Many of the population are killed including most of the troopers.Aki,the head trooper and the professor barely escape and head for Russia.Meanwhile the General has gone to the orbiting energy weapon and starts to rain down its deadly energy upon the Phantoms just as Aki and the trooper are going into the crater in which the Phantoms congregate.Aki has by now learned through a series of dreams,like pieces of a puzzle,that these Phantoms are not living alien creatures but spirits or ghosts of a long dead civilization.Their essence was embedded in a meteor that crashed in that crater in Russia many years before.The energy beams force the gigantic creature in the crater farther into the ground which Aki and the trooper find is occupied by the Earth spirit Gaia.The creatures are red coloured while Gaia is blue.The trooper is killed/taken but Aki uses some of the alien kept dormant within her body,along with the other spirits,to transform the Phantoms into harmless spirits.They return to outer space in a giant shaft of blue light and the Earth returns to normal.Technically speaking the picture is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.This two disc edition is chock FULL of special features,some that only can be accessed through your computer DVD player like the complete screenplay,a version of Michael Jacksons Thriller the Final Fantasy way,and more.Included on these two jam packed discs are,among many other items,two feature length commentaries,storyboard commentary,factoids,a look at Aki as an animated character,The making of FF,a look at several aspects of the art and animation process,alternate opening,the ability to edit and playback a scene from the movie and on and on.It is a tremendous package of extras that will thrill any fan of the film.In conclusion,this animated feature still holds up well after 10 years.The animation is detailed to the nth degree and you can practically count the hairs on Akis head.It was quite the undertaking then and could be considered the Avatar of its day.Recommended.",4,The Avatar of 2001!,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,3965,"['review', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'Oct/2001',

542781,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00003CY5C,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (Hironobu Sakaguchi and Moto Sakakibara, 2001)Every review of this movie I ever read says roughly the same thing: ""the animation in this movie will astound you.  If you're not impressed by animation, though, you might as well ignore it, because there's nothing backing it up."" I hate to say it, but despite animation that is, truly,  fantastic, and a cast that redefines ""high-powered"" in an animated film, those reviews are dead on, and you won't read anything new here.The setting is Earth in 2065. Thirty-four years previous, a large meteorite crashed into the Earth's surface  (forget, for the moment, that the last time a chunk of rock this big crashed into the Earth's surface, the dinosaurs were wiped out), bringing with it an alien race called the  Phantoms. The Phantoms are very invisible, very nasty, and extremely pissed off, and their main mission on Earth seems to be to kill humans as quickly and efficiently as possible.  What's left of humanity is holed up in a large, ultra-secure dome in New York City. Most humans are simply concerned with killing Phantoms in the same way Phantoms kill humans, but two  scientists, Aki (Ming-Na, recently of Mulan) and Sid (Donald Sutherland), are convinced that conventional weapons are not the way to go here; they're of the belief that  a series of eight spirits, when combined correctly and beamed out over the earth, will act towards the Phantoms as matter acts to anti-matter, the two will cancel each  other out, and humans will be free to recolonize their ownplanet. The head of the faction who believes guns ARE the way to go is General Hyde (James Woods), who assigns a  team of stormtroopers to guard Aki and Sid in their quest to find the eight spirits (the film opens with Aki going out into the undomed part of New York to get the  sixth one). The subtext, of course, is that the guards are also monitors. The guards ain't no slouches either, voicewise. Keith David, Peri Gilpin, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Buscemi  all lend their vocal talents to these parts. That's a lot of talent in that there paragraph, Vern. It's also more than enough meat, handled correctly, to come up with a pretty  bang-up story with lots of mysticism AND lots of things blowing up. How cool is that?Not too cool at all, unfortunately. The plot's about as wooden as it could possibly be, and while the voice acting  is exceptional in its understatement for an animated film (where one expects, and probably should expect, overacting; witness the successes of Monsters Inc. and Shrek the same year  of Final Fantasy's release), it more often than not comes off as wooden and unemotional. Whether it's the voice acting, Squaresoft's continuing inability to animate  faces correctly, or a combination of the above remains debatable.The inability to animate faces, though (they're just too smooth, pure and simple), is Square's only shortcoming  where the animation is concerned. There were two or three points during the film where I really did think I was watching a live-action movie. The Spirits Within, if nothing  else, will be remembered for pushing the envelope orders of magnitude farther than any film before it for realistic animation. While that animation itself is probably a good  enough reason to give this thing a ninety-nine cent rental, more than anything it underscores the idea that, if the plot had been carried off with the same flair as the animation,  The Spirits Within would have achieved ""instant classic"" status faster than you can say anime. And that's the biggest disappointment the film offers. **",2,"Excellent animation, but little else",1012780800,"02 4, 2002",2002,3602,"['Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'Hironobu', 'Sakaguchi', 'Moto', 'Sakakibara', '2001', 'review', 'movie', 'ever', 'read', 'roughly', 'same', 'thing', 'animation', 'movie', 'will', 'astound', ""'re"", 'not', 'impressed', 'animation', 'though', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'nothing', 'backing', 'up', 'hate', 'say', 'animation', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'high-powered', 'animated', 'film', 'reviews', 'are', 'dead', 'wo', ""n't"", 'read', 'anything', 'new', 'here.The', 'setting', 'Earth', '2065', 'Thirty-four', 'years', 'previous', 'large', 'meteorite', 'crashed', 'Earth', 'surface', 'forget', 'moment', 'last', 'time', 'chunk', 'rock', 'big', 'crashed', 'Earth', 'surface', 'dinosaurs', 'were', 'wiped', 'out', 'bringing', 'alien', 'race', 'called', 'Phantoms', 'Phantoms', 'are', 'very', 'invisible', 'very', 'nasty', 'extremely', 'pissed', 'off', 'main', 'mission', 'Earth', 'be', 'kill', 'humans', 'quickly', 'efficiently', 'possible', 'What', 'left', 'humanity', 'holed', 'up', 'large', 'ultra-secure', 'dome', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Most', 'humans', 'are', 'simply', 'concerned', 'killing', 'Phantoms', 'same', 'way', 'Phantoms', 'kill', 'humans', 'two', 'scientists', 'Aki', 'Ming-Na', 'recently', 'Mulan', 'Sid', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'are', 'convinced', 'conventional', 'weapons', 'are', 'not', 'way', 'go', 'here', ""'re"", 'belief', 'series', 'eight', 'spirits', 'when', 'combined', 'correctly', 'beamed', 'out', 'earth', 'will', 'act', 'Phantoms', 'matter', 'acts', 'anti-matter', 'two', 'will', 'cancel', 'other', 'humans', 'will', 'be', 'free', 'recolonize', 'ownplanet', 'head', 'faction', 'who', 'guns', 'ARE', 'way', 'go', 'General', 'Hyde', 'James', 'Woods', 'who', 'team', 'stormtroopers', 'guard', 'Aki', 'Sid', 'quest', 'find', 'eight', 'spirits', 'film', 'Aki', 'going', 'out', 'undomed', 'part', 'New', 'York', 'get', 'sixth', 'one', 'subtext', 'course', 'guards', 'are', 'also', 'monitors', 'guards', 'ai', ""n't"", 'slouches', 'either', 'voicewise', 'Keith', 'David', 'Peri', 'Gilpin', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'lend', 'vocal', 'talents', 'parts', 'lot', 'talent', 'paragraph', 'Vern', 'also', 'more', 'enough', 'meat', 'handled', 'correctly', 'come', 'up', 'pretty', 'bang-up', 'story', 'lots', 'mysticism', 'AND', 'lots', 'things', 'blowing', 'up', 'How', 'cool', 'Not', 'too', 'cool', 'unfortunately', 'plot', 'as', 'wooden', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'voice', 'acting', 'exceptional', 'understatement', 'animated', 'film', 'where', 'one', 'probably', 'should', 'expect', 'overacting', 'successes', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Shrek', 'same', 'year', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'release', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'off', 'wooden', 'unemotional', 'voice', 'acting', 'Squaresoft', 'continuing', 'inability', 'animate', 'correctly', 'combination', 'above', 'debatable.The', 'inability', 'animate', ""'re"", 'just', 'too', 'smooth', 'pure', 'simple', 'Square', 'only', 'shortcoming', 'where', 'animation', 'concerned', 'were', 'two', 'three', 'points', 'film', 'where', 'really', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'watching', 'live-action', 'movie', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'nothing', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'orders', 'magnitude', 'farther', 'film', 'realistic', 'animation', 'animation', 'probably', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'give', 'thing', 'ninety-nine', 'cent', 'rental', 'more', 'anything', 'idea', 'plot', 'had', 'been', 'carried', 'same', 'flair', 'animation', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'would', 'have', 'achieved', 'instant', 'classic', 'status', 'faster', 'can', 'say', 'anime', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'film', 'offers', '**']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS
542782,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00003CY5C,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 8]","This is a very dark animated film, in which a remnant of humans are fighting aliens - and each other - to survive.  On the one hand, you have a band of idealists, who believe that the Earth has a spirit that can be used to fight the invaders (whose true nature remains a mystery).  They seek spirit essences of some sort, which when united might save humanity.  On the other hand, there are militarists who see no reason to believe any of this; their ultimate weapon threatens to destroy the Earth's spirit, Gaia.From this somewhat promising premise, the story becomes both a confusing shootout (it is unclear if the enemy aliens die and how to fight them) and a political struggle that becomes extremely deadly.  At least for me, I could not quite forget that I was watching something made up - I never suspended my disbelief and gave myself over to it.  The risks and ambitions just get bigger and bigger, the scenarios more outlandish and desperate and ultimate.  By the end, it had nearly completely lost me.One thing that is good, in my view, is that the outcome remains unexplained and ambiguous.  The viewer is not told what happened and what it means, which is nice in that it leaves a lot to the imagination, which is the mark of all quality sci-fi.  However, I found the characters boringly two-dimensional and the plot unoriginal, in spite of the good special effects.  I assume that the product shoudl stand on its own, as I am not a gamer, and for me it barely did.I would not recommend this except to those who like this world because of their familiarity with the game or because they want a simple adventure.

542784,A2OVR63TMZ8FJJ,B00003CY5C,Robin McDonald,"[0, 1]","The movement and attention to detail of the human characters is truly breathtaking. No less care was taken in creating the spectacular environments, ships, effects and lighting in the rest of the film. Its an unprecedented achievement.Earth has been overrun by strange spirit creatures who have devastated the planet. Their translucent bodies roam the skies and move as comfortably through solid matter as they do air. Their movements when passing through humans are instantly deadly.  A weapon has been developed to destroy the invaders but it use has the potential to destroy the energizing force of the earth.  Two scientists believe they are close to creating a new weapon that effecively neutralizes the enemy and will leave the earth in tact. The experimental weapon is almost complete but requires them to find the last two of eight spirits that make up the dangerous entities. When all are gathered they can create a wave that cancels out their power by duplicating an image of their energy pattern. Unfortunately General Hein (voiced by James Woods) believes there is no time to wait and wishes to immediately deploy the Zeus canon disregarding the risk to the planet. Dr. Aki (Ming Na Wen) and Dr. Sid assisted by a small marine force are in a race against the clock to save the earth from potential destruction from the aliens and their own weapon.The voice acting is very good as is the emotional expressiveness of the animated facial expressions and body language. The story which I felt was going to be a little metaphysical, esoteric and difficult, turned out to be very easy and straight forward. Perhaps only the last few minutes were slightly obscure . While not incredible, I found the story very watchable and kept me interested through the duration. In the end I was quite happy I didn't pass on it as I did when it was in the theaters.  The DVD is packed with an abundance of extras. While I wished I had time to hear the director's commentary, I passed instead to watch the 'making of' documentary. As it does not give any important plot points away, it might be a good primer to watch first. It brings some good insight into the film's creation and adds some nice details to watch out for when seeing the film for the first time.

542786,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00003CY5C,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 3]","In the latter half of the 21st century, Earth has been devestated by an attack of mysterious invaders called ""Phantoms"".  Insubstantial - they can appear out of walls - the Phantoms yank the spirits of human beings out of their mortal husks, I guess to consume them.  Brought to Earth years earlier by a meteor that landed in the Caspian, the Phantoms all but entirely rule the earth, forcing the remnants of humanity into shielded ""Barrier Cities"".  Phantoms come in all shapes or sizes - whether the size of microbes or mountains, yet all having the same basic effect.  With only one chance to make the right decision, the remnants of humanity are caught between two competing strategies for defeating the Phantoms - a military plan advanced by the severe General Hein (voiced by James Woods) involving a huge orbiting space cannon; and the more new-age concept advanced by the sage Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland) involving using the bio waves of living creatures or (as he describes them in private, far from the skeptical and desperate ears of Humanity's remaining leadership) ""spirits"".  Key to the plan is the retrieval of life forms possessing the needed wave by Dr. Aki Ross, a beautiful scientist who is also dying of exposure to microscopic phantoms.  Reluctantly helping her is a squad of armored soldiers led by Captain Gray (Alec Baldwin), one of Aki's old flames.  Aki has already located 5 of the spirits (actually 6, but that's something for the script to explain), and somehow has determined that she need only locate 3 more.  For Aki, it's a race against time - against the Phantoms which are winning their war against both Earth and Aki, and also against Hein who is closing on his goal of convincing the council to green-light an orbital attack that may destroy the Phantoms and the Earth.And I still couldn't get into this flick.  For a premise that wasn't entirely original (hunky marines with guns against hordes of aliens, and a dream sequence of aliens locked in mortal combat on their home world that looks like it was lifted out of ""Quatermass and the Pit""), the script leaves a lot of explaining to do - why are the insubstantial phantoms vulnerable to tangible weapons?;  The council all but summarily dismisses Dr. Sid's theories involving Gaia, the spirit of mother earth, though it's also clear that Ross and Sid have been doing their work and have reaped results for some time, which is more than the militaristic Hein can say;  Phantoms can essentially pass through anything, so why do Gray's troops gear up in heavy body armor?;  Sid cautions Aki to keep all mention of ""spirits"" to herself, yet both of them will use the term openly.  Aki's theories about the true nature of the phantoms make for both an unsatisfying explanation and a cryptic resolution.  It's impossible to understand or to even want to understand the resolution.  As for the characters - computer graphics have created very realistic, but not convincingly lifelike characters.  The animators obviously forgot that even real people need direction and variety, yet the disagreeable face of Hein remains fixed in something like a scowl or a sneer, while Aki looks perpetually somber.  There's a big difference between making computer-generated people look good in stills or even in a few minutes of footage and having them carry an entire movie.  By the end, with a vague climax and never really solidified characters, FF is distinctly underwhelming.",2,Underwhelming,1035763200,"10 28, 2002",2002,3450,"['latter', 'half', '21st', 'century', 'Earth', 'been', 'devestated', 'attack', 'mysterious', 'invaders', 'called', 'Phantoms', 'Insubstantial', 'can', 'appear', 'walls', 'Phantoms', 'yank', 'spirits', 'human', 'beings', 'mortal', 'husks', 'guess', 'consume', 'Brought', 'Earth', 'years', 'earlier', 'meteor', 'landed', 'Caspian', 'Phantoms', 'entirely', 'rule', 'earth', 'forcing', 'remnants', 'humanity', 'shielded', 'Barrier', 'Cities', 'Phantoms', 'come', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'size', 'microbes', 'mountains', 'yet', 'having', 'same', 'basic', 'effect', 'only', 'one', 'chance', 'make', 'right', 'decision', 'remnants', 'humanity', 'are', 'caught', 'two', 'competing', 'strategies', 'defeating', 'Phantoms', 'military', 'plan', 'advanced', 'severe', 'General', 'Hein', 'voiced', 'James', 'Woods', 'involving', 'huge', 'orbiting', 'space', 'cannon', 'more', 'new-age', 'concept', 'advanced', 'sage', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'involving', 'using', 'bio', 'waves', 'living', 'creatures', 'private', 'far', 'skeptical', 'desperate', 'ears', 'Humanity', 'remaining', 'leadership', 'spirits', 'Key', 'plan', 'retrieval', 'life', 'forms', 'possessing', 'needed', 'wave', 'Dr.', 'Aki', 'Ross', 'beautiful', 'scientist', 'who', 'also', 'dying', 'exposure', 'microscopic', 'phantoms', 'Reluctantly', 'helping', 'squad', 'armored', 'soldiers', 'led', 'Captain', 'Gray', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'one', 'Aki', 'old', 'flames', 'Aki', 'already', 'located', '5', 'spirits', 'actually', '6', 'something', 'script', 'explain', 'somehow', 'determined', 'need', 'only', 'locate', '3', 'more', 'Aki', 'race', 'time', 'Phantoms', 'are', 'winning', 'war', 'Earth', 'Aki', 'also', 'Hein', 'who', 'closing', 'goal', 'convincing', 'council', 'green-light', 'orbital', 'attack', 'may', 'destroy', 'Phantoms', 'Earth.And', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'flick', 'premise', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'original', 'hunky', 'marines', 'guns', 'hordes', 'aliens', 'dream', 'sequence', 'aliens', 'locked', 'mortal', 'combat', 'home', 'world', 'was', 'lifted', 'Quatermass', 'Pit', 'script', 'lot', 'explaining', 'do', 'why', 'are', 'insubstantial', 'phantoms', 'vulnerable', 'tangible', 'weapons', 'council', 'summarily', 'dismisses', 'Dr.', 'Sid', 'theories', 'involving', 'Gaia', 'spirit', 'mother', 'earth', 'also', 'clear', 'Ross', 'Sid', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'work', 'have', 'reaped', 'results', 'time', 'more', 'militaristic', 'Hein', 'can', 'say', 'Phantoms', 'can', 'essentially', 'pass', 'anything', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'Gray', 'troops', 'gear', 'up', 'heavy', 'body', 'armor', 'Sid', 'cautions', 'Aki', 'keep', 'mention', 'spirits', 'herself', 'yet', 'will', 'use', 'term', 'openly', 'Aki', 'theories', 'true', 'nature', 'phantoms', 'make', 'unsatisfying', 'explanation', 'cryptic', 'resolution', 'impossible', 'understand', 'even', 'want', 'understand', 'resolution', 'characters', 'computer', 'graphics', 'have', 'created', 'very', 'realistic', 'not', 'convincingly', 'lifelike', 'characters', 'animators', 'obviously', 'forgot', 'even', 'real', 'people', 'need', 'direction', 'variety', 'disagreeable', 'face', 'Hein', 'fixed', 'something', 'scowl', 'sneer', 'Aki', 'perpetually', 'somber', 'big', 'difference', 'making', 'computer-generated', 'people', 'look', 'good', 'stills', 'even', 'few', 'minutes', 'footage', 'having', 'carry', 'entire', 'movie', 'end', 'vague', 'climax', 'never', 'really', 'solidified', 'characters', 'FF', 'distinctly', 'underwhelming']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS

With this 'weapon' she aims to eradicate all of the Phantoms and the source from which they spawn. Against her method of attack is a more violent one by means of a space OP cannon called Zeus whose team leader wants to strike the point of origin for the Phantoms with insane amounts of energy.

542794,A39BAS6VFE2L5L,B00003CY5C,Scott Johnson,"[0, 1]","First, a disclaimer:  I have never played any of the Final Fantasy video games, so this review is strictly a 'movie' review.What's to like about FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN?  There is a lot to like in this movie.  The CGI effects are, in a word, breathtaking.  I recently heard a movie critic complain that humans in CGI never seem lifelike.  That's certainly not the case here.  Facial expression, nuances in shading and background, fluid and lifelike movement - I've never seen an animated movie that even approaches what's been done in this movie.Unfortunately, all the great animation in the world can't save a flawed plotline, and that's where FINAL FANTASY falls short.  Ming-Na, Donald Sutherland, and all the actors give good performances in their voicing of characters, but they aren't given much with which to work, and so the movie suffers.  General Hein is a particularly uninspiring character: though James Woods does an excellent job voicing the part, the General himself is wooden, flat, and a cliched collage of every revenge-driven, over-testosteroned military man we've ever seen.  Even considering the motivation the writers give his character, Hein is still so over-the-top in his blind desire for revenge that the drama in his character is hopelessly lost.Steve Buscemi, Peri Gilpin, and Ving Rhames give excellent performances as members of Alec Baldwin's unit, and Ming-Na is wonderful as Dr. Aki Ross.  There is some prior romantic interest between Baldwin's character and Dr. Ross, but it is never explained and thus weakens the impact their relationship has on the story.Finally a MAJOR problem with the movie is the 'monsters' that are haunting Earth.  No one ever explains how the weapons humanity uses could possibly work against them, and I found myself wondering how guns could possibly inflict damage on creatures that suck the life out of humans at the slightest touch.  Just another loose end in the script that could have been explored and should have at least been addressed.Even with all this, however, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  As I said, the animation is really breathtaking at times, and there are fantasy/sci-fi movies that much, much worse (see Battlefield Earth, Titan A.E.).

I am a freelance digital animator/visual effects artist, and as I have read some reviews, NOBODY can fully appreciate this film's mathematical precision on screen unless they have done this type of work themselves.  Hair follicle and procedural texture simulations, along with precise lighting and specularity, had me fooled many times that DR. Sid, and others, were real actors.  Probably the one scene which caused chills to run down my spine (which is EXTREMELY rare for any CGI artist because he knows the truth behind the visuals and is usually never fooled) was the scene right when Aki and the Captain look into each others eyes after hugging each other (in zero-g in Aki's spaceship).  I was speechless.I did, however, pickup on some slight CGI &quot;inaccuracies.&quot;  Some lipsynching was different than the dubbed dialogue (excusable, mind you that over 1,000,000 facial expression can be made by the face, and creating all of the morph targets for thoses expressions would reach the &quot;infinite&quot; realm).

542802,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00003CY5C,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[3, 3]","I must admit I was really impressed with the CG in this movie. It seems great computer animation is steadily progressing. From Toy Story to War Planets then to Roughnecks:Chronicles of Starship Troopers, Final Fantasy takes the next evolutionary step. The lighting and level of detail in the animation is flawless. The humans are the most convincing you will find in a CG movie. There were 'actors' in some scenes were completely indiscernable from a real human being. I bet that if someone 20 years ago saw this movie they would wonder why the actors look so strange. It's that good.I think one of the limitations of the movie is the strong metaphysical elements in the plot, which doesn't show its head much in American mainstream but is a lot more popular in Japan. The story in of itself is common fare in that aspect, and some people might find it canned. The technology portrayed in this movie is enough to get any sci-fi technie to drool. Holographic control surfaces, aerospace transports, domed cities, big guns, bigger guns!The characters really flesh out the story. The voice actors did a great job all around. It's a real credit to their talents when you can connect with computer generated characters like you would with good actors. Some critics complain about the 'acting' being flat and not expressive. In a fair amount of scenes they are right, but I will marginally side with the animators on this one. When you start rendering the larger, more defined expressions that an actor would make, those real looking CG faces start lose a lot of what makes them look so real. The biggest failing point on that front is they didn't just go to real actors as models for the facial expressions. The CG artists depended on their own facial expressions, and since they aren't actors we end up with what I consider expressions that are way too subtle for film.Sid, the human villian type, really annoyed me. James Woods did a great job bringing him to life, but the guy was just written so one dimensional. Plus he thwarts the heroes efforts to save the world one too many times for my taste. I mean really!! How many times are we supposed to sit and see the good guys just seconds away from victory only to have Sid screw it up by doing something stupid?!? I felt like pulling my hair. But I digress.If you are going to get a DVD of this movie the Special Edition is the only way to go. For those of you into how CG movies are made there is so much information that it will make your head spin. For those who aren't so much into that you get some good featurettes too. There is even an outtakes featurette, which consists mostly of the animators goofing around with test footage, but it's fun to watch. Also you get an easter egg with our heroin, Aki Ross, playing Michael Jackson to a host of monsters reinacting the Thriller dance routine.Final Fantasy is a really good movie.

542806,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00003CY5C,Steven Reynolds,"[0, 0]","What's most surprising about this computer-generated sci-fi spectacular is that it doesn't rely on technical wizardry alone.  Along with its jaw-dropping visuals and superb sound design, ""Final Fantasy"" manages to tell an original, appealing and emotionally involving story that probably wouldn't stand up if made as a live-action film, given its spiritual content.  Fortunately, animation can go where live action fears to tread, and while its mysticism won't appeal to everyone, fans of Manga and other Asian animations will probably find this fusion of futuristic science and ancient spirituality hits the mark.  The plot unravels only slightly at the climax, requiring a strange sacrifice that doesn't make sense in the context of what's come before it.  So ultimately, I guess, it's the good and bad aspects of the script which are most telling here.  Technically, CGI may or may not be the future of cinema, but ""Final Fantasy"" demonstrates that good storytelling is and always will be the heart of a good movie, no matter how it's produced.  (It also proves that Alec Baldwin is much more convincing when you can't see him.)  This double-disc DVD is packed with extra features that fans will enjoy - though it takes a while to find much of what's promised on the packaging.

542808,AK5X97CRMU17P,B00003CY5C,Sun Ce,"[0, 0]","This movie comes with 2 discs.  The first has the movie, the other contains all the really awesome extras.  In most cases, animated movies are great.  They usually have a strong story with breath-taking graphics.  Toy Story 1 and 2 are both the best examples.Final Fantasy's animation and graphics just blow everything that's been done away!  The movements are fairly realistic, the character models are great and very deep, the action equals to that of any decent action flick.  This is what computer animation is supposed to be like!Is that enough reason to buy this movie?  Maybe.What about the story since that is what movies are about?  The story is very Final Fantasy non-standard (as compared to the video games).  There are no swords, no chocobos, no lead male character, no summoning of monsters or even magic.  No, this is a sci-fi flick in the vain of such movies like Aliens, Pitch Black, Akira, and Bladerunner.The story feels very Japanese.  It is dealing heavily with the human spirit after death.  Does it return to the Earth (or Gaia as it is called in the movie) to join the planet's spirit? Mixed in with this ideaology is that 'aliens' have crash landed on Earth and seem to like 'killing' off the human inhabitants.  There are two stories running together; what to do with the aliens and how does the human spirit fit into all this?  Oh, I forgot that they are hunting for the last of THE 8 spirits.  What those are, I have no idea.It does all tie together...  Barely.If you look deeper, you find the enemy is not the aliens, but ourselves.  It is this deeper meaning that drives this movie and what the Final Fantasy games are really about.So the story is neat in concept, but not well written.  (This occurs in RPGs all the time...)  How about characters?  Afterall, it has an all star cast with Ming Na, Donald Sutherland, a Baldwin and Steve Buscemi!I really felt that they weren't fleshed out well.  Sutherland's character might be the best and he's just the doctor.  The love between Aki and Gray's characters are decent, but because their personalities fall a bit flat, it's hard to to really care THAT much.  Buscemi's character appears to be the comic relief, much like Jar Jar in Star Wars.  While he's not very funny, at least he's human.  And the rest of Gray's fire team, well, they can be easily compared to Corp. Hick's team in Aliens.The real delight of this 2-disc set is the 2nd disc.  I don't know of many DVDs that have extras that are really worth having.The documentary is great and really helps the feel and the story of the movie. Once you watch that, you'll watch the movie with a bit more respect to the time, effort, and emotions that went into the film.  There's goofy outtakes (not as refined as Toy Story's unfortunately), a music video O_o, and all sorts of other swell things.  I haven't viewed an extras disc just as good since Mummy Returns or Star Wars1.The movie alone, I don't think is worth buying.

I'm especially impressed with how well they rendered Aki's hair, it seems that it is the hardest element artists have to work on, because you almost always see a female with either short cropped hair or have it pulled back into a bun or ponytail. But here we got to see very naturally flowing locks. And just for that, I think it's worth viewing once.However, the story itself didn't seem to offer much as far as character development, action scenes, or just something to break up the stagnant pace of the film. They tried to stick in a few lighthearted moments, but they fell way flat.In fact, I found the bonus footage on the DVD which included fabricated technical goofs and the Thriller spoof, much more entertaining than the movie itself.A better story might have made all the difference with me, but I also tend to think, that rendering lifelike characters and having them behave (or at least trying to) like real people may not be the best way to use the technology. If you want them to be so true to life why not just cast real people.

The movie cost an estimated 130+ million dollars to make and only made around 38 million in the theatre in the US. The DVD is a showcase of the processes used to make the film as well as a digital to digital transfer for the best possible picture and sound quality. There are lots of extras and a really neat interface. If you even thought it was so-so in the theatre then it is worth the 20 bucks for this DVD because it is the last one they will make and a remarkable achievement in computer animation. Disney and Dreamworks cant hold a candle to this films quality and level of detail. This movie is geared towards the teen to adult crowd for realistic violence. Literally every single frame is beautiful and so real looking that you might forget you were watching digital actors. Yes it really is that good. The only sign of CG is in mouth movement during certain dialogue sequences where the lips dont seem to be animated enough. A small and trivial complaint when you consider the fact that the movie took almost 5 years to make from start to end and is 106 minutes and each frame was created individually and there is around 40 frames per second or so. Imagine painting a picture 40 times for just one second of animation. Now think about 40 pictures times 60 for a minute and then so on and so on for 106 minutes of grade A choice animation. If you have not seen this movie then at least rent it as it truly is something everyone should see for the artisitic aspect if nothing else. These people put it all on the line and lost it for this movie and at the same time set a standard so high for animation that it will be years before we see Disney or another studio even attempt the level of detail in this film.

It demonstrated natural motion, not just walking and standing, hair, fabric, explosions, rich backgrounds, and naturalistic physics in an incredible tour de force.If I must pick few nits, the animators didn't quite capture skin's subtlety. Skin interacts with light in layers, not just at the surface, and these characters tended towards a waxy look. Also, despite the characters' rich ranges of motion, a few things are conspicuous by their absence. Running, jumping more than a foot or two, fighting or embracing, and all extremes are just missing. They're too hard. Body masses change shape under muscle tension, when bouncing, and when in forceful contact - if the animators could not do these complex jobs properly, they chose not to do them at all. I respect that decision, and look forward to more complex body models in the future. Cloth, too, was a weak point. Dr. Sid's tunic, General Hein's trenchcoat, and (in the extras) Aki's skirt all have the same drape, and not a very interesting one at that. Well, cloth is hard to model, and I look forward to better cloth models, too.That's about it, though. The plot is worn, and the 'scientific' premise never quite hangs together for me. The characters tend to be one-dimensional. It's an interesting comparison to ""Tokyo Godfathers."" That presents realistic characters, but revels in its nonrealistic imagery.This movie is all about its imagery and technical achievement. Those are wonderful. They define the industry's state of the art as of the movie's debut, and even now, a few years later. Technology moves forward, though.

542826,A1YEPFLLH42OU1,B00003CY5C,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""","[1, 1]","First off, this is one impressive film. Just the fact that you don't see a single actor in the movie, but it is nevertheless very well acted, is impressive enough. This is definitely a landmark display of computer graphics, and the plot is superb.But really, now, is it Final Fantasy? After seeing the movie twice, I just can't connect it to the FF premise. In fact, if the title had been something else other than 'Final Fantasy,' the only tip-off I would have had was the appearance of the ubiquitous Cid. This is the only flaw of the movie- it might let down those who are expecting something like the hugely popular Final Fantasy games. Although the movie is just as exciting as any of the titles, it is more of a sci-fi/fantasy flick than an adventure. Those of you who will be waiting for the big boss battle at the end (this, as far as I know, is something you can count on in any FF game) will probably be disappointed. In fact, the movie does many things that none of the games ever did. For one, it is set on Earth, albeit a future one. Also, there really is no enemy (if you don't know what I'm talking about, you didn't see the whole thing). More specifically, there is no arch-rival for the heroes to throw down. Also, it doesn't have a happy ending.Of course, this wasn't enough to make Final Fantasy a poor film- quite the contrary, I think it's excellent. It just isn't really based off the games, so if you're expecting it to be, you might be a bit confused. Just don't turn it off, because it really is a great film anyway.",4,"A great movie, but is it truly Final Fantasy?",1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,1541,"['First', 'off', 'one', 'impressive', 'film', 'Just', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'single', 'actor', 'movie', 'nevertheless', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'impressive', 'enough', 'definitely', 'landmark', 'display', 'computer', 'graphics', 'plot', 'superb.But', 'really', 'now', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'seeing', 'movie', 'twice', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'connect', 'FF', 'premise', 'fact', 'title', 'had', 'been', 'something', 'else', 'other', ""'Final"", 'Fantasy', 'only', 'tip-off', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'was', 'appearance', 'ubiquitous', 'Cid', 'only', 'flaw', 'movie-', 'might', 'let', 'down', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'hugely', 'popular', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'games', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'exciting', 'titles', 'more', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'flick', 'adventure', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'waiting', 'big', 'boss', 'battle', 'end', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'something', 'can', 'count', 'FF', 'game', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'movie', 'many', 'things', 'none', 'games', 'ever', 'did', 'one', 'set', 'Earth', 'future', 'one', 'Also', 'really', 'enemy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'whole', 'thing', 'More', 'specifically', 'arch-rival', 'heroes', 'throw', 'down', 'Also', ""n't"", 'have', 'happy', 'ending.Of', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'poor', 'film-', 'contrary', 'think', 'excellent', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'based', 'off', 'games', 'so', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'be', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'confused', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'anyway']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS
542827,A1TOML01ZYPUFR,B00003CY5C,"Zachary S. Houp ""RAREfiend""","[0, 1]","There is a certain literary phrase called &quot;suspension of disbelief.&quot;  Anyone who has ever seen a film, read a book, or witnessed some other artistic expression has no doubt had to &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; in some way.  In The Spirits Within, it is hard, and that happens NOT as a result of the subject matter.  Instead, the screenwriters never give us any reason to &quot;suspend disbelief.&quot;  Instead they fill a promising plot--one that COULD have extensive moral and environmental implications--with a tale that revitalizes an aspect of Roman Mythology, but fails repeatedly to provide any explanation for all of these supposed &quot;scientific and mythological&quot; conclusions.  Most movies AT LEAST provide this; it helps the audience to believe, regardless of scientific untruths and other fantastical circumstances.  There are a lot of truly good plot twists that fall through cracks because the script doesn't take the time to explain them even a little.On the subject of visuals, it is the best yet, but that is not to say it is perfect.  Ignoring some inconsistent speech-with-lip movement, are the mannerisms.  Yes, I believe this is the first time that I have decided that animated characters needed an acting coach.  The voices are no doubt done as well as they are able, but the characters motions and emotions belong on daytime television or worse yet CABLE!  But, aside from this, The Spirits within will probably own the prestige of best visuals in a fully CGI film, because in all other respects, it is perfect, a near exact replica of exitence.In conclusion, The Spirits Within is a good movie to see in the theatre--preferably second run--but not something that warrents repeat viewings or even a place in one's collection.  There are many times when the film COULD be quite brilliant, but then along comes poor &quot;acting,&quot; plot that isn't reinforced, and to top it all off, dialogue that would make a child cringe--or laugh!  A simple note, in the theatre, perhaps even at the most serious and emotional times, the audience couldn't restrain laughter on account of the absurdness of the characters, dialogue, and plot.  Square gave a good first try, but they could have done a lot better.",2,A Must See...for the visuals only.,1002844800,"10 12, 2001",2001,2238,"['certain', 'literary', 'phrase', 'called', 'quot', 'suspension', 'disbelief.', 'quot', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'witnessed', 'other', 'artistic', 'expression', 'doubt', 'had', 'quot', 'disbelief', 'quot', 'way', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'hard', 'NOT', 'result', 'subject', 'matter', 'Instead', 'screenwriters', 'never', 'give', 'reason', 'quot', 'disbelief.', 'quot', 'Instead', 'fill', 'promising', 'plot', 'one', 'COULD', 'have', 'extensive', 'moral', 'environmental', 'implications', 'tale', 'aspect', 'Roman', 'Mythology', 'repeatedly', 'provide', 'explanation', 'supposed', 'quot', 'scientific', 'mythological', 'quot', 'conclusions', 'Most', 'movies', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'provide', 'audience', 'believe', 'regardless', 'scientific', 'untruths', 'other', 'fantastical', 'circumstances', 'are', 'lot', 'truly', 'good', 'plot', 'twists', 'fall', 'cracks', 'script', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'explain', 'even', 'little.On', 'subject', 'visuals', 'best', 'yet', 'not', 'say', 'perfect', 'Ignoring', 'inconsistent', 'speech-with-lip', 'movement', 'are', 'mannerisms', 'Yes', 'believe', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'decided', 'animated', 'characters', 'needed', 'acting', 'coach', 'voices', 'are', 'doubt', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'able', 'characters', 'motions', 'emotions', 'belong', 'daytime', 'television', 'worse', 'yet', 'CABLE', 'aside', 'Spirits', 'will', 'probably', 'own', 'prestige', 'best', 'visuals', 'fully', 'CGI', 'film', 'other', 'respects', 'perfect', 'near', 'exact', 'replica', 'exitence.In', 'conclusion', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'good', 'movie', 'see', 'theatre', 'preferably', 'second', 'run', 'not', 'something', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'even', 'place', 'one', 'collection', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'COULD', 'be', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'then', 'along', 'poor', 'quot', 'acting', 'quot', 'plot', ""n't"", 'reinforced', 'top', 'off', 'dialogue', 'would', 'make', 'child', 'cringe', 'laugh', 'simple', 'note', 'theatre', 'perhaps', 'even', 'most', 'serious', 'emotional', 'times', 'audience', 'could', ""n't"", 'restrain', 'laughter', 'account', 'absurdness', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'Square', 'gave', 'good', 'first', 'try', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'better']",Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within VHS
