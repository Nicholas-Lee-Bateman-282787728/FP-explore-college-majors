If you go into this film as a mainstream horror movie fan expecting a smaller budget straight to dvd film that should have made it into the theatre's then you will be truly disappointed.If your a true horror fan & have an affinity for horror films of all budgets,shapes & sizes then you will absolutely find a place in your disturbed little heart for this very fun & witty horror comedy made on a boatload of creativity,by a few very talented horror fans & put together with chump change. It is very apparant that these cats had a blast making this movie. This is truly a blueprint for any wanna be film maker with plenty of idea's & no money.

1008996,A24SC3EXWOIK2P,B000H1RFUK,"Dead Kev ""Zombie Advocate""","[2, 4]","Bum-feelers! That's right, if you're reading this right now...you're a bum-feeler! By the way, while I'm saying that I'm laughing hysterically and pointing at you. Yeah, I know you can't see me, just trust me though.At its core, FREAK OUT is a heartfelt story of two best friends, Merv Doody (James Heathcote) and Onkey (Dan Palmer), striving to make their home, the isle of Redwater Cove, a better place. No, I'm lying. It IS about two friends named Merv and Onkey, but the story centers on their pet project of taking a hapless (and very effeminate) escaped mental patient under their wing and teaching him how to be a real serial killer. That is indeed a noble cause. The world needs more good citizens like Merv and Onkey.It's rare that I laugh as much at a movie as I did during FREAK OUT. I think I literally busted a gut. That would certainly explain the stain on my chair. It's so silly and so absurd, but it's absolutely hilarious. It's such a goofy script, yet at the same time it's very intelligent. It's a comical send-up of classic horror films likeThe Evil Dead,Friday the 13th, and the like. Unlike movies likeScary Movie, it's more than just a satire, much more than just a parody. Those films make the gags the centerpiece and the plot seems more like an afterthought, while FREAK OUT uses the gags to compliment a genuinely funny storyline. So there's plenty below the surface, and it has a much more natural flow to it. The jokes come in bunches, a lot of them random and out of nowhere, but they aren't forced down the audience's throat. Instead, they sneak right up behind you.then smack you in the back of the head.For an independent film, the most surprising aspect for me was the fact that the acting was great! Once I got used to the accents (most likely not a problem for those in the UK), I wasn't distracted by anyone's performance. Heathcote and Palmer have very good onscreen chemistry (perhaps more than we realize?), and are quite believable as best buds. Heathcote is praiseworthy as the loveable loser, and Palmer does a first-rate job as the annoying sidekick who, more often than not, is responsible for getting them into trouble. The dialogue is all delivered with ease and director Christian James does a terrific job guiding the film from behind the camera. Lots of savvy camera work, deftly shot scenes, and solid editing make for a visually stimulating journey, and really go a long way in making you forget this isn't some big-budget production. And as much as it's pleasing to the eye, it's just as pleasing to the ear. Composer Stuart Fox's work on the film is some sweet ear candy.So what have we got so far? How about a great script, cool music, solid acting, some arse piranhas, a few zombies, plenty of horror spoofs, and a serial killer that's a tad light in his loafers. That's enough for me, I smell an Oscar. No wait, that's me, I must have soiled myself during the movie. Regardless, FREAK OUT's a winner and is destined to be a fan favorite!",4,Bum-Feelers Unite!

1008998,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,B000H1RFUK,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[1, 1]","This movie is what it is, an amateur attempt at making a horror/comedy. There are some laughs, but to be honest they are few and far in between, making the movie seem like it is 4 hours long. Now I'm not saying this is a bad flick, but in the right hands it could have been so much better. A silly plot, lame special effects, unforgetable one-liners, and goofy characters are all B-movie musts, and this flick has it all, but for some reason a lot of the jokes or gags did not transfer to film as well as they did in the director's head.The writeup on the back of the box promises nudity, there is none, except for a one second scene of a woman who takes her shirt off on a TV screen that our hero is watching.The escaped mental patient is indeed funny and does have some good moments, he is my favorite character in the movie. I think the main problem with this film is that it just seems to go on and on with no end in sight. Maybe if a half hour or 45 minutes of mindless and useless footage had been removed, this would have been a great little one hour film.Recommended for B-movie fans, but don't rush out and feel the need to buy it.
