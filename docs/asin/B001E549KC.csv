1184567,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B001E549KC,Flash,"[3, 3]","The Waltons is my favorite TV show. It has the best kind of story-arc which is simply that of a genuine family growing up in the depression and the WWII years. Certainly by season 8, I still miss Richard Thomas as John-Boy, Grandpa, Grandma (pre-stroke) and to some extent Olivia. But that's just how life goes. Isn't it? Names and faces change, but the stories of the Walton clan go on. We even get to see Jim-Bob and especially Elizabeth grow up a little more in season 8. Overall, the quality of the drama is still pretty good. I especially recommend the episodes: The Silver Wings, The Spirit, The Idol and The Rememberance.Season 8 introduces a few new character's but somehow it all fits pretty nicely. Cousin Rose and her grandchildren. Ben's wife Cindy. Even the new John-Boy is acceptable. He's brought in gradually, which is good because it eases the shock of such a principal character change. While he lacks some of Richard Thomas' energy and innocence, you can see how he at least tries to capture some of the ""old"" John-Boy in the role.Lastly, although not credited (nor is it listed on imdb.com) I'm pretty sure that Harrison Ford makes a guest appearance at the very end of the episode called The Medal. In the Dew-Drop Inn, you see an actor at a table with another guy singing ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"". It's him right? Did anyone else notice this? Can anyone confirm it?While not five star material like seasons 1-6, season 8 still makes for some quality TV viewing.

Second oldest son Jason has enlisted, while third son Ben is helping the war effort at home by helping their father John run the family lumber mill, which is overwhelmed with military orders. Eldest daughter Mary Ellen is traveling the mountain as a nurse, while her sister Erin is working in the steel mill office.Their biggest concern, however, is eldest son John-Boy -- missing in action while overseas on assignment for the Stars & Stripes. Months and months of tireless questioning and prayers by the family bring about nothing, and everyone's reluctantly beginning to fear they may have to admit the worst.While Season 8 is full of rich storylines and much of the same elements that made earlier seasons so popular with fans, viewers may want to take note that this season is notably different. For starters, there are a number of new regulars -- Olivia's cousin Rose, come to stay with the family, along with her young grandchildren Selena and Jeffrey, as well as Ben's new bride Cindy. Conversely, several of the beloved regulars are missing -- John-Boy, of course, as well as Grandma (who is said to be ""off visiting"") and Olivia away ""volunteering at the veterans' hospital in Richmond."" Many of the B-characters, such as the eccentric moonshining Baldwin sisters and Verdie are almost never seen as well.Still, this classic series is still worth watching.

Some episodes are good, but this season takes the show and almost turns it into something else.The main focus in season 8 is World War 2. With all the Walton boys off to fight, even the girls are pitching into the war effort. This season marks the return of John-Boy, who was pronounced missing in action in the beginning of the season. He turns up in a nearby hospital, where we find out he's no longer played by Richard Thomas. Now, Robert Wrightman assumes the role and he's nowhere as good as Thomas was. This hospitalization causes Olivia to join the Red Cross, and thus midway through this season she disappears from the show for good.New in this season we have Rose Burton, a cousin of Olivia's who comes to the house to pretty much replace the role of Grandma, and later on Olivia herself as well. So by he end of the season, we have the girls at the house, Rose, and John.Think what you want about my review, but aside from a few interesting episodes, this season is better left alone.

Michael Learned (Olivia) returned for twelve episodes, Ellen Corby is seen in fewer episodes as Grandma, and Robert Wightman makes his first appearance as John-Boy; replacing Richard Thomas for the rest of the series.Despite these things, the show still retained its family values, and appeal.  The season begins with World War II raging, John-Boy is missing in action, Jason is in charge of recruits, and Olivia struggles to keep up with her changing family.  Erin, Elizabeth, and Mary Ellen do their best to help in the war effort, and Ben and Cindy have their first baby.When Olivia leaves to go back to the Sanitorium, Rose--a close family member--comes to help with the needs of the family.

1184580,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,B001E549KC,Rons Reviews,"[15, 18]","In 1971 CBS did some major house cleaning which included canceling its ""rural"" oriented programming.  In December of that same year, CBS would air Earl Hamner Jr.'s ""The Homecoming"", which would lead them back to rural programming in the form of ""The Waltons"" in September of the following year.On January 6th 2009 Warner Home Video will release all twenty-four episodes of season eight of The Waltons on a three-disc set.  Unfortunately, by season eight, the series has jumped several sharks, and is far from the depression era family drama that we came to know and love.By the time we get to Season eight, Richard Thomas who originated the role of John Boy is gone, and would be replaced by a one dimensional Robert Wightman, Michael Learned, who portrayed mother Olivia Walton, contract had expired and would not appear in all the seasons episodes, new family members are introduced which is never a good sign, and the thespians who had adequately portrayed the Walton children, had grown into mediocre actors tasked with carrying the series.The writing too had grown tired by 1979, and though this season still contains some poignant moments, the attempts at lightheartedness are forced, and well beyond the talents of the current cast.  For all intensive purposes the writing was on the walls of the iconic Walton home and the show would last only one more season.The shining moments at this point in the series come from the relationship between John (Ralph Waite) and Olivia Walton.  Though limited in this season due to the absence of Michael Learned, the chemistry between these two talented actors remained strong throughout the series, and added a level of quality to this season, that only left the rest of the cast to appear to be severely lacking.World War II served as the theme for many of this seasons episodes, but the writing generally manages to keep the family, and subsequently the audience, from being pulled into the drama associated with such an important time in our history.  One exception is the storyline in the two-part season opener in which John, who is assigned to the local draft board, deals with the death of a neighbor's son.  It is the superior performance by Waite that makes this segment work.Earl Hamner Jr. remained involved in the series from inception to conclusion, and his narrations remain throughout bringing a level of nostalgia to the series that is sure to illicit a smile from anyone who enjoyed the series in it's heyday.  Unfortunately Hamner also hosts the only piece of bonus material in this new release, the two hour special: ""A Decade of the Waltons"". Hamners slow delivery made for a wonderful folksy introduction to this classic show, but as a host, he was far too awkward, and lacked the personality necessary to lead us down memory lane.  Hamner's wardrobe, tinted glasses, and absence of a smile (There may have been dental issues as in the one scene in which he is laughing, he remains off camera) did not help the situation. The poor quality of this retrospective does not fall solely on Hamner as the standard clips lack continuity, and the interviews with the actors and their real life counterparts seem overly staged and stiff. Since this special aired at the end of season eight; it is a bit generous to list it as a bonus feature.Not a lot of notable guest appearances during the season, but it's fun to see a young Jonathan Frakes in episode eight ""The Lost Sheep"", and if you look quick you can spot Eric Stoltz sitting in the class room in episode twenty-four ""The Valediction"".The shows look and sound great.  The packaging leaves a lot to be desired, and if both sides of the disc were going to be utilized, it would be helpful if the discs were better marked.Recommendation:  This is a classic series, but the quality began to wane after the first five seasons. Season eight is only for the true fan that wants to keep their collection up to date",2,The Waltons Season 8 - It's Been Much Better,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,3924,"['1971', 'CBS', 'did', 'major', 'house', 'cleaning', 'included', 'canceling', 'rural', 'oriented', 'programming', 'December', 'same', 'year', 'CBS', 'would', 'air', 'Earl', 'Hamner', 'Jr.', 'Homecoming', 'would', 'lead', 'back', 'rural', 'programming', 'form', 'Waltons', 'September', 'following', 'year.On', 'January', '6th', '2009', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'will', 'release', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'season', 'eight', 'Waltons', 'three-disc', 'set', 'Unfortunately', 'season', 'eight', 'series', 'jumped', 'several', 'sharks', 'far', 'depression', 'era', 'family', 'drama', 'came', 'know', 'love.By', 'time', 'get', 'Season', 'eight', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'who', 'originated', 'role', 'John', 'Boy', 'gone', 'would', 'be', 'replaced', 'one', 'dimensional', 'Robert', 'Wightman', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'who', 'portrayed', 'mother', 'Olivia', 'Walton', 'contract', 'had', 'expired', 'would', 'not', 'appear', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'new', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'introduced', 'never', 'good', 'sign', 'thespians', 'who', 'had', 'adequately', 'portrayed', 'Walton', 'children', 'had', 'grown', 'mediocre', 'actors', 'tasked', 'carrying', 'series.The', 'writing', 'too', 'had', 'grown', 'tired', '1979', 'season', 'still', 'poignant', 'moments', 'attempts', 'lightheartedness', 'are', 'forced', 'well', 'talents', 'current', 'cast', 'intensive', 'purposes', 'writing', 'was', 'walls', 'iconic', 'Walton', 'home', 'show', 'would', 'last', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'season.The', 'shining', 'moments', 'point', 'series', 'come', 'relationship', 'John', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'Olivia', 'Walton', 'Though', 'limited', 'season', 'due', 'absence', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'chemistry', 'two', 'talented', 'actors', 'remained', 'strong', 'series', 'added', 'level', 'quality', 'season', 'only', 'left', 'rest', 'cast', 'appear', 'be', 'severely', 'lacking.World', 'War', 'II', 'served', 'theme', 'many', 'seasons', 'writing', 'generally', 'keep', 'family', 'subsequently', 'audience', 'being', 'pulled', 'drama', 'associated', 'important', 'time', 'history', 'One', 'exception', 'storyline', 'two-part', 'season', 'opener', 'John', 'who', 'assigned', 'local', 'draft', 'board', 'deals', 'death', 'neighbor', 'son', 'superior', 'performance', 'Waite', 'segment', 'work.Earl', 'Hamner', 'Jr.', 'remained', 'involved', 'series', 'inception', 'conclusion', 'narrations', 'remain', 'bringing', 'level', 'nostalgia', 'series', 'sure', 'illicit', 'smile', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'heyday', 'Unfortunately', 'Hamner', 'also', 'only', 'piece', 'bonus', 'material', 'new', 'release', 'two', 'hour', 'special', 'Decade', 'Waltons', 'Hamners', 'slow', 'delivery', 'made', 'wonderful', 'folksy', 'introduction', 'classic', 'show', 'host', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'awkward', 'lacked', 'personality', 'necessary', 'lead', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'Hamner', 'wardrobe', 'tinted', 'glasses', 'absence', 'smile', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'dental', 'issues', 'one', 'scene', 'laughing', 'camera', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'situation', 'poor', 'quality', 'retrospective', 'not', 'fall', 'solely', 'Hamner', 'standard', 'clips', 'lack', 'continuity', 'interviews', 'actors', 'real', 'life', 'counterparts', 'seem', 'overly', 'staged', 'stiff', 'special', 'aired', 'end', 'season', 'eight', 'bit', 'generous', 'list', 'bonus', 'lot', 'notable', 'guest', 'appearances', 'season', 'fun', 'see', 'young', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'episode', 'eight', 'Lost', 'Sheep', 'look', 'quick', 'can', 'spot', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'sitting', 'class', 'room', 'episode', 'twenty-four', 'Valediction', '.The', 'shows', 'look', 'sound', 'great', 'packaging', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'sides', 'disc', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'utilized', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'discs', 'were', 'better', 'marked.Recommendation', 'classic', 'series', 'quality', 'began', 'wane', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'Season', 'eight', 'only', 'true', 'fan', 'keep', 'collection', 'date']",The Waltons: Season 8
