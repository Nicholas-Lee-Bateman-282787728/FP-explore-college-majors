And while this was a Family Edition, there was no lack of competition and drama.TAR8 is definitely worth checking out if you never watched it or is worth watching again with a fresh perspective.",5,Still one of the best TAR seasons!,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,1000,"['many', 'were', 'appalled', 'idea', 'Family', 'Edition', 'season', 'TAR', 'almost', 'international', 'travel', 'season', '8', 'especially', 'hindsight', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'exciting', 'seasons.The', 'cast', '10', 'families', 'featured', 'more', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'lot', 'other', 'TAR', 'seasons', 'memorable', 'personalities', 'little', 'Carissa', 'Billy', 'Gaghan', 'youngest', 'people', 'ever', 'Race', 'outspoken', 'Paolo', 'family', 'who', 'provided', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'Mat', 'ever', 'villains', 'loved', 'hate', 'Weavers.The', 'route', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'domestic', 'many', 'fans', 'traveling', 'most', 'iconic', 'locations', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'different', 'yet', 'equally', 'exciting', 'showing', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'travel', 'far', 'experience', 'stunning', 'breathtaking', 'destinations', 'was', 'Family', 'Edition', 'was', 'lack', 'competition', 'drama.TAR8', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'never', 'watched', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'fresh', 'perspective']",N/A

Editing wise, it's one of the cleanest seasons. Nothing feels rushed like in later seasons. The challenges were interesting (I think this may be the only season where every detour option was shown being completed by the teams) and the drama is intense (thank you Weavers! And Rolly is a cutie)My only knock to this product that makes it 4 and not 5 is that it is missing the ""Previously on the Amazing Race"" recaps at the beginning of the episodes. Which is odd as I have purchased Seaons 5 & 6 through Amazon and they have been included with those releases so it's surprising they were omitted with this purchase. Hopefully this will be the only season with the recaps missing as it does not feel like a complete product without them.All in all. Great buy. The case is nice, the visual quality is great.

1574348,A5YY84IO6W2Q5,B008R4LHJ4,Sheryl McCallister,"[0, 0]","The Family Race was a bold idea that probably sounded good on paper, but in practice, just didn't work. Partly, I think it was limiting the travel mostly to North America; but mostly, I just think that a 4 person teams are just unwieldy on camera for viewers to get a clear handle on all the players as a general rule, but when those players are related, sometimes the family dynamic just doesn't work on camera. For me, it's a design flaw that really doomed this Race for me as a viewer.Specific teams:As bad as the Weavers were--and Mama Weaver sits right next to Season 2's Wil on my list of people I despise for the way they acted on the race, and based on their behavior, she'd apparently ruined at least 2 of her kids by the time this aired originally--as disgustingly BAD as the Weavers were? The Gaghans provided a beautiful counterpoint while they lasted--and NOT just as competitors. Their behavior on the way to, and at the mat, knowing they were last, and about to be eliminated, after that stupid, stupid, time wasting coffee bean task?  Those 5 minutes or so of aired footage are some of the best parenting I've ever seen on TV. It's actually the only amazing thing in this edition of the race.And if the Race is still on the air when Carissa Gaghan is old enough to compete in a 'normal' race, she and her brother Billy are the team I would MOST like to see back. I'd love to see what kind of young adults those two remarkable and brave kids grew into, and moreso, I'd like to see how they would race.The best of the rest? The Paolo kid being the only person from any team to recognize Kevin and Drew handing out the first clue.  That kid was racing! If his family had listened to him, they'd have made the finals, I'm sure.  He's another one I'd like to see back, but with teammate who listens to him.Keep your finger on the mute button while you watch this, so you can avoid listening to the Weavers.",3,"Weavers AWFUL; mitigated by Gaghans, while they lasted",1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,1917,"['Family', 'Race', 'was', 'bold', 'idea', 'probably', 'sounded', 'good', 'paper', 'practice', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Partly', 'think', 'was', 'limiting', 'travel', 'mostly', 'North', 'America', 'mostly', 'just', 'think', '4', 'person', 'teams', 'are', 'just', 'unwieldy', 'camera', 'viewers', 'get', 'clear', 'handle', 'players', 'general', 'rule', 'when', 'players', 'are', 'related', 'sometimes', 'family', 'dynamic', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'camera', 'design', 'flaw', 'really', 'doomed', 'Race', 'viewer.Specific', 'teams', 'As', 'bad', 'Weavers', 'were', 'Mama', 'Weaver', 'right', 'Season', '2', 'Wil', 'list', 'people', 'despise', 'way', 'acted', 'race', 'based', 'behavior', ""'d"", 'apparently', 'ruined', 'least', '2', 'kids', 'time', 'aired', 'originally', 'disgustingly', 'BAD', 'Weavers', 'were', 'Gaghans', 'provided', 'beautiful', 'counterpoint', 'lasted', 'NOT', 'just', 'competitors', 'behavior', 'way', 'mat', 'knowing', 'were', 'last', 'be', 'eliminated', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'time', 'wasting', 'coffee', 'bean', 'task', '5', 'minutes', 'so', 'aired', 'footage', 'are', 'best', 'parenting', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'actually', 'only', 'amazing', 'thing', 'edition', 'race.And', 'Race', 'still', 'air', 'when', 'Carissa', 'Gaghan', 'old', 'enough', 'compete', ""'normal"", 'race', 'brother', 'Billy', 'are', 'team', 'would', 'MOST', 'like', 'see', 'back', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'what', 'kind', 'young', 'adults', 'two', 'remarkable', 'brave', 'kids', 'grew', 'moreso', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'race.The', 'best', 'rest', 'Paolo', 'kid', 'being', 'only', 'person', 'team', 'recognize', 'Kevin', 'Drew', 'handing', 'out', 'first', 'clue', 'kid', 'was', 'racing', 'family', 'had', 'listened', ""'d"", 'have', 'made', 'finals', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'back', 'teammate', 'who', 'him.Keep', 'finger', 'mute', 'button', 'watch', 'can', 'avoid', 'listening', 'Weavers']",N/A
