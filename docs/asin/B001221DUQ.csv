OUTPOST combines the slow-drawn claustrophobia and paranoia of THE BUNKER with the high-powered military action of DOG SOLDIERS in this subtle but effective zombie Suspense / Thriller.

Ray Stevenson takes a strong lead as he commands the team against the supernatural forces, while each of the soldiers battling beneath him look and feel like authentic guns for hire caught entirely unaware.

Little do they know, but the money couldn't come close to the price they'll pay for doing the job.  Inside the bunker are things no living human was meant to see or know, and these guys have had the bad luck of finding out.I'm not giving you specifics about the nightmarish secrets and horrors within the bunker. I don't want to spoil potential thrills for those who may watch this little-known gem of a terror tale.  I'll only say that the bad guys (or should I say ghouls) in this movie are SS soldiers, of course, and they're also no less than superhuman SS zombies! Yes, you read that right--superhuman SS zombies!  This movie has definitely taken the SS to a new level of terror. This movie is complete with secret SS super weapon experiments, creepy relic-filled bunkers, and even fake, albeit realistic SS footage from the past.This movie is not without its flaws.  However, to me, they are very forgiveable.  For example, the uniforms, etc. are not always exactly as they should be.  The Nazi zombies do wear the black Allgemeine SS uniforms, although they likely shouldn't, but that's just more sinister for the purposes.  For all you hardcore fans in-the-know about regulations of the period, this could be a distraction.  However, if you're like me, you won't mind that at all.  Yes, after all, I'm never really bothered by technical inaccuracies in movies such as this.  We're not talking about Valkyrie here, or any other such films about historical events.  We're talking about all out war with the undead!  Creative license here, I think, is just a necessary and excusable freedom.  When it comes to war/horror movies, I'm just happy enough to even have such movies at all.Outpost certainly holds its own as a unique and original war/horror tale that surprisingly exceeds its lower budget.  It effectively delivers everything we want from a movie of its type.  There's plenty of blood, lots of carnage, and no shortage of courageous albeit suicidally motivated soldiers.  Gore and violence are expectedly gratuitous, as one would expect.  If you have a taste for this niche of war/horror, then you'll likely love this one.  It's just a good thing that real bullets won't kill the already dead.  If that were the case, we'd all be missing quite a lot of fun.  Be sure to watch Outpost.

1134365,A2MB7ZIINKGPY1,B001221DUQ,"D. Steinmetz ""dwsteinme""","[0, 0]","I was plesantly surprised by this low budget thriller. A group of mercenaries are hired by a man to go into a war-torn area somewhere in Europe. He won't reveal his reason for wanting to get into the dangerous area, saying only that he is ""an engineer"". This comes into play later.Once there, the soldiers find an old underground bunker, formally used by the Nazis. No doubt freaky experiments were done, as evidenced by the medical equipment and a pile of bodies, one of them still living. Ok, I said 'realisitic' in my title, but as with any film of this genre, there are times when you have to suspend logic. Why the bodies never rotted away isn't explained. And when our ill-fated heroes manage to fire up a WW 2 era generator with relative ease, that stretches things a bit. But it doesn't take away from the story too much. Things soon go from mundane to nightmarish as the group realizes they're facing an army of the undead, created in part by the very object the engineer is seeking.The main flaw in this film is that it's very difficult to feel any empathy for the soldiers. The 'man', who organized the mission, is just in it for a chance to make money. The mercenaries seem to be more enthusiastic about getting the opportunity to fight and kill again. Sort of a 'bored with it all but what else are we gonna do' mentality. As their leader, Ray Stevenson delivered a fine performance as the war-weary ex-soldier who's just there to do a job and get out. Little did he know that he and his men would get more trigger time than they ever imagined...I won't give it away, but be forewarned there is no happy ending to this one, but it did leave it wide open for a sequel, which, from what I understand, is in the planning stages now. Funny that another poster mentioned ""Shock Waves"". As far as the 'Nazi zombie' flicks go, ""Outpost"" is head and shoulders above that one. Not for the kids or squeamish, although the gore that is shown is brief and not overly graphic. If you're into zombie horror films, this one should satisfy nicely.

1134367,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B001221DUQ,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","Undoubtedly the Nazis left a huge impression on the world. One we can't seem to shake. A relatively small country that took on the world, with a weird little megalomaniac at the wheel, and went down in flames. I guess it was so absurd one could only stare with dropped jaw at such a bizarre occurrence. History has since discovered much about them that wasn't apparent at the time. Yes, they were into some weird stuff. Yes, Hitler was into the occult and he had his minions scraping the globe for ancient artifacts. He also had them doing some research in areas of science far removed from the rest of the western world. Maybe this is why we keep dredging them up and making these whacky movies about them.The first movie I remember seeing was ""Shockwaves"" which dealt with Zombiefide Nazi SS soldiers who are held up on a tropical Island with their ""master"" and come to life to hassle some unsuspecting castaways. Just released is ""Dead Snow"" with a similar story but set in the snowy mountains of Sweden. Somewhere in between is this movie,""The Outpost"" which is set in current times in Eastern Europe and is similar again except that these Nazi Zombies flit between this dimension and an adjacent one through the operation of a machine patterned along the line of ideas generated by Einstein's ""Unified Field Theory."" Another departure is that in this movie there aren't any unsuspecting victims. These guys are tough hombres. They are a group of mercenaries hired to escort a guy on a mission from a big corporation to scout out some land they bought for ""mineral"" purposes. Of course the guy is lying. He's looking for this Unified Field machine. He finds it and as the situation unfolds, all of them come to realize the depth of the kimchi they're in.This is good, tight film making. It's a small band of mercs but you do get to know most of them as the story progresses. Though some might complain they are more ""types"" than personalities, they are drawn well enough for the viewer to get a bead on who they are as the kimchi hits the fan.This is a lean 90 minutes. The story progresses at a steady pace. The cinematography and editing are solid. It sports a good, mood inducing soundtrack. Some of the sound mixing is top shelf as well. The sound of the guns going off in the bunker have a great ring to them. The acting is good to even all around. The only actor I recognized is the group's leader, but all do a stand up job with their parts.There are a few holes in the plot, such as; why hasn't anyone stumbled on this site before? It's not like the place is hidden or anything. Also there is the fact that the zombies do things during the climax that they don't do during earlier scenes. (I can't say without spoiling things) But these are minor complaints given the overall quality. This is also a good example of what can be done on a limited budget. Not a lot of money was spent here but it was spent wisely. If you like this sort of thing this is a great way to spend 90 minutes.",4,Just Can't Shake Those Nazis,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,2996,"['Undoubtedly', 'Nazis', 'left', 'huge', 'impression', 'world', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'shake', 'A', 'relatively', 'small', 'country', 'took', 'world', 'weird', 'little', 'megalomaniac', 'wheel', 'went', 'down', 'flames', 'guess', 'was', 'so', 'absurd', 'one', 'could', 'only', 'stare', 'dropped', 'jaw', 'bizarre', 'occurrence', 'History', 'discovered', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'time', 'Yes', 'were', 'weird', 'stuff', 'Yes', 'Hitler', 'was', 'occult', 'had', 'minions', 'scraping', 'globe', 'ancient', 'artifacts', 'also', 'had', 'doing', 'research', 'areas', 'science', 'far', 'removed', 'rest', 'western', 'world', 'Maybe', 'why', 'keep', 'dredging', 'up', 'making', 'whacky', 'movies', 'them.The', 'first', 'movie', 'remember', 'seeing', 'was', 'Shockwaves', 'dealt', 'Zombiefide', 'Nazi', 'SS', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'held', 'up', 'tropical', 'Island', 'master', 'come', 'life', 'hassle', 'unsuspecting', 'castaways', 'Just', 'released', 'Dead', 'Snow', 'similar', 'story', 'set', 'snowy', 'mountains', 'Sweden', 'Somewhere', 'movie', 'Outpost', 'set', 'current', 'times', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'similar', 'again', 'Nazi', 'Zombies', 'flit', 'dimension', 'adjacent', 'one', 'operation', 'machine', 'patterned', 'line', 'ideas', 'generated', 'Einstein', 'Unified', 'Field', 'Theory', 'departure', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'unsuspecting', 'victims', 'guys', 'are', 'tough', 'hombres', 'are', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'hired', 'escort', 'guy', 'mission', 'big', 'corporation', 'scout', 'out', 'land', 'bought', 'mineral', 'purposes', 'course', 'guy', 'lying', 'looking', 'Unified', 'Field', 'machine', 'situation', 'unfolds', 'come', 'realize', 'depth', 'kimchi', ""'re"", 'in.This', 'good', 'tight', 'film', 'making', 'small', 'band', 'mercs', 'do', 'get', 'know', 'most', 'story', 'might', 'complain', 'are', 'more', 'types', 'personalities', 'are', 'drawn', 'well', 'enough', 'viewer', 'get', 'bead', 'who', 'are', 'kimchi', 'fan.This', 'lean', '90', 'minutes', 'story', 'steady', 'pace', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'solid', 'sports', 'good', 'mood', 'inducing', 'soundtrack', 'sound', 'mixing', 'top', 'shelf', 'as', 'well', 'sound', 'guns', 'going', 'off', 'bunker', 'have', 'great', 'ring', 'acting', 'good', 'even', 'around', 'only', 'actor', 'recognized', 'group', 'leader', 'do', 'stand', 'up', 'job', 'parts.There', 'are', 'few', 'holes', 'plot', 'such', 'why', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'stumbled', 'site', 'not', 'place', 'hidden', 'anything', 'Also', 'fact', 'zombies', 'do', 'things', 'climax', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'spoiling', 'things', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'given', 'overall', 'quality', 'also', 'good', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'limited', 'budget', 'Not', 'lot', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'here', 'was', 'spent', 'wisely', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'great', 'way', 'spend', '90', 'minutes']",N/A

He and his men are tasked with taking an engineer to a WWII German outpost for a grand total of [...], a supposedly 48-hour easy in-out job that, of course, turns into something quite different.The low budget of this film doesn't really show except, perhaps, for the drab colors, but that's not really a big deal, considering everyone is dressed in camouflage and surrounded by sky that is either overcast (in the day) or dark (at night).  And, of course, they're also in a dimly lit concrete bunker the rest of the time.*** BEGIN POSSIBLE SPOILER ***The only plot issue is that the events at the outpost could--based on the movie's ""science""--happen within seconds, rather than over the course of the night.

(This is reminscent of the laser tunnel in ""Resident Evil,"" which first sends a single beam down to slice people, then a different beam, then a web of beams.

The location turns out to be an old bunker from world war 2 and the 'something' happens to be the research done in the bunker.  Unfortunately, when they get there, they turn on the power and wake what remains of the former tenants of the bunker.

Despite the low budget, this is actually a very good horror movie.  The acting is far better than what you can expect from most horror films, and Ray Stevenson and the rest of the cast make a very convincing group of soldiers/mercs.  What makes this movie work is its atmosphere.  Like Alien, much of this movie's ambience is dark, creepy and oppressive.

1134399,AB0WO69IUZAYV,B001221DUQ,T. Hawkes,"[2, 2]","I thought this was a well-produced, well-acted, and generally well-written movie. It works on several levels and manages to comment on the world today by linking the story to the WWII era with a sci-fi plot device.The sci-fi aspect is not that well developed (the only real flaw in the movie) but it doesn't distract too much from the overall effect and meaning of the movie. I have to admit that I wanted the script to end differently, but perhaps that was the point of the story: by the end of the film we understand that man's inhumanity to man--and the men who perpetrate the ""profession of violence""--are both perpetual.Spoilers Ahead...The events in the film are meant to point out that the SS Nazis who are still protecting the experimental machine related to Einstein's ""Unified Field Theory"" (something quite different that the script makes it out to be) are not all that much different from the soldiers of fortune who were hired to help a mysterious man (the scientist) locate something of value to him. As the plot unfolds, it tells a straight-forward horror/sci-fi tale but the better-than-average script manages to comment on several notable things along the way: the military and the chain of command, the value of faith and/or a belief in God amidst truly terrifying circumstances, and the importance of money as a motivator in today's world. I felt that I was getting more than my money's worth...I got a scary story in a well-produced film that also had something to say about today's world by recalling the horrors of a previous time.By the way, I actually felt sorry for the ""trapped"" ghost soldiers and the SS leader by the end of the film because they were never released by death from the violence that rules their lives (and WWII and the Nazi regime were as violent and horrible as war has ever been...the only difference today is we've just got better weapons). The ghost soldiers seemed to be doomed to protect the very thing that had created their perpetual vigilance, thereby meaning that there would be no end to their that existence. In telling the story, the script puts lots of words into the various characters' mouths about their views of our still very violent world and their places in the world as hired soldiers. The fact that the long-dead Nazis have a sort of ""technology edge"" over the living soldiers is, I'm sure, one of the intended ironies of the story.Although I wasn't surprised at the ending, I just am old enough to want the script to let someone in the original group survive the ordeal. I say I'm ""old enough to want"" because I recall a time when there were actually protagonists in such films (not just anti-heroes or villains) that the audience was to identify with and thus want to see survive. One of my pet peeves about most sci-fi or horror films made since 9/11 (Sept. 11, 2001) is that in our post-terrorist-attack world, everyone in the story must die at the end and that means that there are no heroes in today's scripts, just anti-heroes.Anyway, this film is more than creepy, atmospheric, logical, and scary enough to warrant a DVD rental. And if you like Nazi stuff and/or the idea of time-travel sci-fi mixed with military-mentality commentary and want to examine the script in multiple viewings (perhaps even with the captions on because some of the sound and accents are hard to decipher) you'll want to buy the movie. I rented it because, according to the DVD box, the film had zombie (undead) Nazis. What more do you need to know?? Zombies. Nazis.
