I had low expectations -- that we would get the usual check list of problems, causes and events.  Slam them in and crank out a movie.  I do not know Hilary Duff's work; I have heard the name.  I can say she has done a convincing job.  I  can assert that the casting in general is strong.Gretta the troubled child is put on a bus by her mother because mom is trying to stop her current husband from exiting.  Gretta is an annoyance, and bloody adept at it. She is going to Ocean Grove, New Jersey, an idyllic ocean-front resort where Gretta's grandparents have lived since mom was a brat.  Ocean Grove is one of the beautifully built ocean fronts in the world.  Large houses where porches and upper story balconies are prized far above a lawn, to gaze on the Atlantic and breathe oh so well.The central theme is teen suicide.  There are others.  The songs are a dead, so to speak, give away,  The opening ""I Wanna Die"" might trigger the theme, but of course it is a lovely song about wishing to die in Louisiana, rather than, say, Burma. The sound track in general is thoughtfully chosen and effective in this well executed not in-your-face mode.  Nice touch with this song.  Another is a classic 50's summer seaside song, ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" by heart throb Frankie Avalon.I like how the grandmother (Ellen Burstyn is better than in so many anguish-only roles), and grandfather are fully developed characters.  Evan Ross is superb as the romantic interest and, more importantly, the foil to Gretta's background.  He almost steals the show, but I am happy with both.  We will be seeing more of him.With all of the story, there is still a little to see of careful film making.  In Grandfather's marina, do not miss the long shot of the dog paddling among the slips; he fetches what otherwise looks like merely another floating board.  Nice touch, this.  Next you will see his project: restoring a mahogany cabin cruiser.  These are the glories of our 1890-1940 boat industry.  This boat deserves to be the platform of the movie's climax.All themes are intelligently expressed, especially the hard ones.  I have only one nagging question, which is ""Who am the guy in the photo at the very end?""  I know his face and I am having a brain-out.  Lastly, the movie has the good grace to close with an Oscar Wilde quote.",4,To lose one parent...,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,2366,"['are', 'plenty', 'problem-child', 'films', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'would', 'get', 'usual', 'check', 'list', 'problems', 'causes', 'events', 'Slam', 'crank', 'out', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'work', 'have', 'heard', 'name', 'can', 'say', 'done', 'convincing', 'job', 'can', 'assert', 'casting', 'general', 'troubled', 'child', 'put', 'bus', 'mother', 'mom', 'trying', 'stop', 'current', 'husband', 'exiting', 'Gretta', 'annoyance', 'bloody', 'adept', 'going', 'Ocean', 'Grove', 'New', 'Jersey', 'idyllic', 'ocean-front', 'resort', 'where', 'Gretta', 'grandparents', 'have', 'lived', 'mom', 'was', 'brat', 'Ocean', 'Grove', 'one', 'beautifully', 'built', 'ocean', 'fronts', 'world', 'Large', 'houses', 'where', 'porches', 'upper', 'story', 'balconies', 'are', 'prized', 'far', 'lawn', 'gaze', 'Atlantic', 'breathe', 'oh', 'so', 'well.The', 'central', 'theme', 'teen', 'suicide', 'are', 'others', 'songs', 'are', 'dead', 'so', 'speak', 'give', 'away', 'opening', 'Wan', 'Die', 'might', 'trigger', 'theme', 'course', 'lovely', 'song', 'wishing', 'die', 'Louisiana', 'rather', 'say', 'Burma', 'sound', 'track', 'general', 'thoughtfully', 'chosen', 'effective', 'well', 'executed', 'not', 'in-your-face', 'mode', 'Nice', 'touch', 'song', 'classic', '50', 'summer', 'seaside', 'song', 'Voyage', 'Bottom', 'Sea', 'heart', 'throb', 'Frankie', 'Avalon.I', 'how', 'grandmother', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'better', 'so', 'many', 'anguish-only', 'roles', 'grandfather', 'are', 'fully', 'developed', 'characters', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'superb', 'romantic', 'interest', 'more', 'importantly', 'foil', 'Gretta', 'background', 'almost', 'show', 'am', 'happy', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'more', 'him.With', 'story', 'still', 'little', 'see', 'careful', 'film', 'making', 'Grandfather', 'marina', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'long', 'shot', 'dog', 'paddling', 'slips', 'what', 'otherwise', 'merely', 'floating', 'board', 'Nice', 'touch', 'Next', 'will', 'see', 'project', 'restoring', 'mahogany', 'cabin', 'cruiser', 'are', 'glories', '1890-1940', 'boat', 'industry', 'boat', 'be', 'platform', 'movie', 'climax.All', 'themes', 'are', 'intelligently', 'expressed', 'especially', 'hard', 'ones', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'nagging', 'question', 'Who', 'am', 'guy', 'photo', 'very', 'end', 'know', 'face', 'am', 'having', 'brain-out', 'Lastly', 'movie', 'good', 'grace', 'close', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'quote']",According to Greta

Sadly, however, with a running time of less than 90 minutes (not including credits), the solid cast could not salvage a rather superficial storyline not given enough time to mature and develop.As a moody, disrespectful, angst-filled teenager mad at the world, Hilary Duff gives the performance of her career and creates one of the most distasteful and unlikeable characters in recent memory. It made the film difficult to embrace, but I assumed that, over time, her character would subtly change and her behavior at the start was necessary to appreciate the journey. Sadly, however, her character stays mostly the same until the last fifteen minutes when a sudden, unbelievable change takes place that wraps everything up a little too nicely. The love interest, which serves as the film's emotional core, completely vanishes and remains unresolved, though a better ""alterate ending"" on the DVD provides a tiny shred of closure.All in all, this is not a bad film. It could have potentially been a great film if given a realistic running time of two hours to better develop the characters and their relationships.  As it is, I have difficulty recommending it.  It is worth noting that on the DVD you get a better alternate ending, about seven minutes of deleted scenes, and a decent 18-minute behind-the-scenes featurette that, somehow, does not feature Hilary Duff at all even though most of the cast and crew give interviews.",3,Could have been great,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,1542,"['heard', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'performances', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Sadly', 'however', 'running', 'time', 'less', '90', 'minutes', 'not', 'including', 'credits', 'solid', 'cast', 'could', 'not', 'salvage', 'rather', 'superficial', 'storyline', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'mature', 'develop.As', 'moody', 'disrespectful', 'angst-filled', 'teenager', 'mad', 'world', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'performance', 'career', 'one', 'most', 'distasteful', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'recent', 'memory', 'made', 'film', 'difficult', 'embrace', 'assumed', 'time', 'character', 'would', 'subtly', 'change', 'behavior', 'start', 'was', 'necessary', 'appreciate', 'journey', 'Sadly', 'however', 'character', 'mostly', 'same', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'when', 'sudden', 'unbelievable', 'change', 'place', 'everything', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'nicely', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'emotional', 'core', 'completely', 'vanishes', 'unresolved', 'better', 'alterate', 'ending', 'DVD', 'tiny', 'shred', 'closure.All', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'potentially', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'given', 'realistic', 'running', 'time', 'two', 'hours', 'better', 'develop', 'characters', 'relationships', 'have', 'difficulty', 'recommending', 'worth', 'noting', 'DVD', 'get', 'better', 'alternate', 'ending', 'about', 'seven', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'decent', '18-minute', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'somehow', 'not', 'feature', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'even', 'most', 'cast', 'crew', 'give', 'interviews']",According to Greta

Like any kid from the early 2000s, I fell head over heels for Hilary Duff as Lizzie McGuire and then became mesmerized by her albums. When I read that she plays a suicidal teenager in an indie film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Duff has played teens for a decent part of her life, but never one who was as serious as this character.Overall, I was really surprised by how much I fell in love with this movie. The story is well-developed, though not particularly unique and interesting. However, what makes the whole movie unique is the characters and their development. Greta has many levels of emotion to her, all of which are revealed throughout the movie. Julie is an ex-rebel who had cleaned his act up. And Greta's grandparents are simple and sweet, and it seems a wonder in the beginning that they can handle having Greta around.Though it may seem like it could be a little slow, this movie moves at a really good pace and advances the characters pretty quickly.I really do have to praise the acting in this movie, which I thought was fantastic. Veteran actress Ellen Burstyn, who plays Greta's grandmother, does a fantastic job and is easily able to switch emotions and feelings throughout the movie. Evan Ross, who plays Julie, did not bring as much darkness to his character as I think it calls for, but he does an amazing overall job. Michael Murphy, Greta's grandfather, does a perfect job of creating a character who stands calm and collected next to Ellen Burstyn's own character. And finally, Hilary Duff really kills it in this role. She shows a lot of depth and seriousness in a role which feels much more adult than her other roles. I hope she develops her more adult roles more in the future, because I think she was stellar in this movie.The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is that the end didn't feel finite or complete enough. It is definitely worth watching the movie, but the end didn't exactly hit me as amazing.Overall, I really recommend this movie, if anything because of Hilary. :)",4,Unexpectedly incredible film,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,2100,"['When', 'first', 'read', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'kid', 'early', '2000s', 'fell', 'head', 'heels', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'then', 'became', 'mesmerized', 'albums', 'When', 'read', 'suicidal', 'teenager', 'indie', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Duff', 'played', 'teens', 'decent', 'part', 'life', 'never', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'serious', 'character.Overall', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'story', 'well-developed', 'not', 'particularly', 'unique', 'interesting', 'However', 'what', 'whole', 'movie', 'unique', 'characters', 'development', 'Greta', 'many', 'levels', 'emotion', 'are', 'revealed', 'movie', 'Julie', 'ex-rebel', 'who', 'had', 'cleaned', 'act', 'up', 'Greta', 'grandparents', 'are', 'simple', 'sweet', 'wonder', 'beginning', 'can', 'handle', 'having', 'Greta', 'may', 'seem', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'slow', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'pace', 'characters', 'pretty', 'quickly.I', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'praise', 'acting', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Veteran', 'actress', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'Greta', 'grandmother', 'fantastic', 'job', 'easily', 'able', 'switch', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'movie', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'who', 'Julie', 'did', 'not', 'bring', 'as', 'much', 'darkness', 'character', 'think', 'amazing', 'overall', 'job', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'Greta', 'grandfather', 'perfect', 'job', 'creating', 'character', 'who', 'calm', 'collected', 'next', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'own', 'character', 'finally', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'really', 'role', 'lot', 'depth', 'seriousness', 'role', 'much', 'more', 'adult', 'other', 'roles', 'hope', 'more', 'adult', 'roles', 'more', 'future', 'think', 'was', 'stellar', 'movie.The', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'finite', 'complete', 'enough', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'hit', 'amazing.Overall', 'really', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anything', 'Hilary']",According to Greta

Not the most original script, but let's face it, most movies end just the way you thought they would and take the path you thought they would take. In `According to Greta' it is mostly about watching the journey. We see into Greta's inner thoughts through diary sequences, a clever montage of doodles, clip art and frantic scribbles. I have to admit, it was one of the most interesting, and perhaps the only original, thing about the show.Evan Ross shines on-screen, turning in a wonderfully understated performance, in contrast with Hillary Duff's performance, which seems just a little too desperate. (We get it, you aren't Lizzy McGuire anymore.) I think Duff does a respectable job in the role; the character is just a little much. She's smart, she's bored, and she's clever.

Lebryk,"[1, 1]","A twenty two year old tries to play a seventeen year old entitled brat that pushes every imaginable button of everyone around her and we are supposed to feel sorry for her and love her in the end. No this movie does not work.Hillary Duff, (not a bad but not a good actress Lizzie McGuire / Disney captive), is Greta a spoiled entitled east coast bee atch sent off to her grandparents Ocean City house for the summer, mother can't take care of her anymore and is working on her next marriage. The grandparents are played by two wonderful actors, Ellen Burstyn and Michael Murphy. Grams (the annoying name Greta uses for her grandmother) tries very hard to make up for seventeen years of bad parenting in two months. Greta loves to push every one of Gram's buttons and make her angry.Greta is the perfect bee atch, and that aspect of her character is built perfectly. Poor Greta, her father died when she was younger and now she is taking it out on the world. The world must also notice that this fabulously attractive, brilliant, sensitive, darling is trying to commit suicide. Where the movie stumbles is the horribly predictable humanizing of Greta and how she tries to turn her life back around. The audience is supposed to believe that pulling a wagon of potted plants around and giving them to sad old people is redemption. My reaction to her great change was the same as Grams, I wish you hadn't done that. There's also the predictable 'guess who's coming to dinner' nonsense that backfires on Greta.Hillary Duff turns in a horrible performance, probably not far from her real personality. The big surprise was Julie, the line cook at the restaurant where Greta works, played by Evan Ross. He was believable, strong, and caring in all the right ways. Ross does not have a long list of films; I expect he will do well in his upcoming films.The movie is rated PG-13. Given the language and a discussion about condoms, it probably isn't a film for viewers younger than 13. When Greta walks through Asbury Park (the forbidden zone), there is a bit of loud arguing and a person lighting up something indistinct. An adult might recognize this as gang fighting and possibly a crack pipe, but it's a long stretch.I disliked this film. It was predictable and I did not buy the redemption moment. This was not a dark depressing movie, it was a movie about a girl that thinks she is entitled to everything, is more attractive and sensitive than she really is.

It's a beautiful city, however, not enough fun for wild, sarcastic Greta. She wants to be crazy, have a great time, and experience life before she kills herself. (Which is what she has decided to do before her 18th birthday.) She writes in her journal often, which has a ""to do"" list, and it includes things like: Get into a fist fight with a man, and lose my virginity. Her journal also has a ""How to Die"" list, and she tries to come up with the most interesting and possibly painless ways to commit the deed. She also spends a lot of time looking at old pictures (her past is painful) and swimming in her clothes.Her grandparents tell her that if she wants money, then she will have to get a job. She is hired on at a local restaurant as a server. It is then that she meets Julie, a line cook with a past. They both really like each other, but he knows a little more about life than she does, and it shows.Will Greta spend the whole summer making herself (and the others around her) miserable? Or will faling in love make her overcome her teen angst and grow up?I have always enjoyed small, independent movies, and I wanted to like this one. But, there was something too contrived about Greta's character. Maybe because she plays the good girl so often, it was hard for her to be a bad girl. Some of the humor made me laugh, but it was ridiculous how she got her job at the restaurant, and how she treated customers. I also saw some things coming and was able to predict them before they happened. That always disappoints me because I want to be surprised. I will say that once again, I was impressed by Evan Ross who plays Julie. This is the second film that I've seen him in, and he's a very good actor. Plus, I will always love Ellen Burstyn (who played Grams) in every part that she plays.I think that the movie had potential, and even though not everything ties into a perfect bow, I still would have enjoyed a more realistic ending that didn't feel so much like a Hallmark movie.",2,Maybe I'm the only one who didn't love it...(2 1/2 stars),1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,2100,"['Greta', 'sent', 'grandparents', 'house', 'New', 'Jersey', 'mom', 'tries', 'work', 'out', 'third', 'husband', 'beautiful', 'city', 'however', 'not', 'enough', 'fun', 'wild', 'sarcastic', 'Greta', 'be', 'crazy', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'experience', 'life', 'Which', 'what', 'decided', 'do', '18th', 'birthday', 'journal', 'often', 'do', 'list', 'things', 'Get', 'fist', 'fight', 'man', 'lose', 'virginity', 'journal', 'also', 'How', 'Die', 'list', 'come', 'up', 'most', 'interesting', 'possibly', 'painless', 'ways', 'commit', 'deed', 'also', 'lot', 'time', 'looking', 'old', 'pictures', 'past', 'painful', 'swimming', 'clothes.Her', 'grandparents', 'tell', 'money', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'get', 'job', 'hired', 'local', 'restaurant', 'server', 'then', 'Julie', 'line', 'cook', 'past', 'really', 'other', 'little', 'more', 'life', 'Greta', 'spend', 'whole', 'summer', 'making', 'others', 'miserable', 'will', 'faling', 'love', 'make', 'overcome', 'teen', 'angst', 'grow', 'up', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'small', 'independent', 'movies', 'wanted', 'like', 'one', 'was', 'something', 'too', 'contrived', 'Greta', 'character', 'Maybe', 'good', 'girl', 'so', 'often', 'was', 'hard', 'be', 'bad', 'girl', 'humor', 'made', 'laugh', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'how', 'got', 'job', 'restaurant', 'how', 'treated', 'customers', 'also', 'saw', 'things', 'coming', 'was', 'able', 'predict', 'happened', 'always', 'disappoints', 'want', 'be', 'surprised', 'will', 'say', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'impressed', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'who', 'Julie', 'second', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'played', 'Grams', 'part', 'think', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'even', 'not', 'everything', 'ties', 'perfect', 'bow', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'realistic', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'Hallmark', 'movie']",According to Greta

The plot reveals a young woman who is growing up right before our very eyes, going from a teenager filled with anger and issues of abandonment, to a rebellious girl sent to spend a summer with her grandparents, to a young woman attempting to become independent through a job, where she meets a young man that has had very difficult times and clashes with what he perceives as a person who ""could be lots of fun, passionate, but who could get him into trouble again.""The movie started slow, one has to ponder as to where the movie is taking us and soon we find ourselves in the middle of a powerful story of transformation.Hillary Duff's performance as this 17 year old who is overcoming parental abandonment issues while she figures out who she is and who she wants to be is magnificent. The grandparents, played by Ellen Burstyn and Michael Murphy are pivotal to her growth, presenting the generational friction necessary for Greta to create a vision for the future.Without attempting to give the plot away, if you enjoy transformational movies that reveal key elements of personal growth, then this movie is excellent.

My grandmother, who was my most favorite person in the world, died when I was only 18 and there was so much I hadn't yet learned from her. Visiting her was always my favorite day of the week and I hate to see teenagers on TV wasting away that time. On the other hand, sometimes it bothers me even more when it is someone my current age in a movie who STILL has their grandparents and does not appreciate it. I guess maybe I can understand if the kid grew up with their grandparents far away and never got a chance to know them. But still, it irritates me when teenagers act like all adults are idiots. It doesn't take much of a brain to realize that the longer you use your brain, the more of a brain you will have. Hence, age usually equals wisdom. It doesn't always equal maturity, but oh well.I like Hilary Duff. I even used to watch her on Lizzie McGuire periodically, even though I was a bit too old for that show. I've been pleased recently to see her expanding her horizons. I thought she did an excellent job in this movie as Greta, even though it was hard to see her playing such a mean character. After getting to know Greta (a not very subtle acronym for ""Great,"" she tells us), you could understand what she was going through and sympathize. She had a hard life, was not always treated well or raised well, and acted out based on what she knew. I don't want to give the ending away, but she started to pull herself together, and while she may always be the type with a bit of a rebellious streak, I think there is a lot of hope for Greta.",3,Has a lesson... eventually,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,1674,"['very', 'hard', 'watch', 'movies', 'where', 'teenagers', 'treat', 'grandparents', 'parents', 'elders', 'such', 'disrespect', 'grandmother', 'who', 'was', 'most', 'favorite', 'person', 'world', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'only', '18', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'learned', 'Visiting', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'day', 'week', 'hate', 'see', 'teenagers', 'TV', 'wasting', 'away', 'time', 'other', 'hand', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'someone', 'current', 'age', 'movie', 'who', 'STILL', 'grandparents', 'not', 'appreciate', 'guess', 'maybe', 'can', 'understand', 'kid', 'grew', 'up', 'grandparents', 'far', 'away', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'know', 'still', 'when', 'teenagers', 'act', 'adults', 'are', 'idiots', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'brain', 'realize', 'longer', 'use', 'brain', 'more', 'brain', 'will', 'have', 'Hence', 'age', 'usually', 'wisdom', ""n't"", 'always', 'equal', 'maturity', 'oh', 'well.I', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'even', 'used', 'watch', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'periodically', 'even', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'show', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pleased', 'recently', 'see', 'expanding', 'horizons', 'thought', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'movie', 'Greta', 'even', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'playing', 'such', 'mean', 'character', 'getting', 'know', 'Greta', 'not', 'very', 'subtle', 'acronym', 'Great', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'sympathize', 'had', 'hard', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'treated', 'well', 'raised', 'well', 'acted', 'out', 'based', 'what', 'knew', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'ending', 'away', 'started', 'pull', 'together', 'may', 'always', 'be', 'type', 'bit', 'rebellious', 'streak', 'think', 'lot', 'hope', 'Greta']",According to Greta

She, and the writers, create a character which can be identified with and understood.  Unlike artificial characters of most movies, Greta is real, at moments she isn't very nice, but at other moments she evokes great sympathy from the audience.This isn't a ""teen fluff"" movie.  There are funny moments, but this is not a comedy. It's not a romance either, yet there are romantic touches.  It's basically real life, perhaps aspects of it you may not have experienced in your life, but that is all the more reason to watch a movie like this, it provides an opportunity to encounter some real life emotions and issues.""Greta"" will never win any awards, nor gain much attention, because it lacks sex, violence and action.  Yet it's not boring (primarily because of the good performances and realistic nuances), it's exactly what a movie should be: escape from your life and a chance to see into someone else's life.

Boki""","[1, 1]","Somewhere between the screenplay and Ms. Duff's performance in the first half of the movie, the power of this film is almost undermined. Miss Duff, as Executive Producer, clearly found the story appealing. However, it takes a closer look to fully appreciate the winning qualities of this endeavor. Miss Duff seems unclear how to embrace the role. Should she portray the character's youthful recklessness as a reflection of what her audience would expect? Or will she allow the role to provide her with the bridge she seems to be searching for from teen idol to serious actress?. The script is  slow to reveal where the movie's gravitas lies. That is part of its problem because the writer (s) are not completely comfortable in taking a bold leap with the story. That cautiousness places the movie just right above a ""movie of the week"" television fare. The addition of Ms. Burstyn and Ms. Leo also gives the movie breeding.While this movie was built around Hillary Duff, the bright, sparkling career of Evan Ross continues to shine through. In his first semi-romantic lead, Evan's character, Julie, is mature, remorseful and loving. Ms. Duff may have thought that this ""bad girl"" role would be an opportunity for her  to stretch and move into more adult roles. Instead, she comes off looking like a spoiled, undeserving brat. In one of the first more arresting scenes, when she callously reveals how Julie (Evan Ross) learned to cook, it is Evan Ross that pulls the scene up and gives Ms. Duff's ""Greta"" more substance to play off of. The Academy Award winning actress, Ellen Burstyn, seems a little uncomfortable in the role of her grandmother. Perhaps that is intentional. The affection shared between her and her husband, as seniors still capable of loving, is unique in cinema today.Evan Ross has an impressive resume of films (25) in some stage of development/production. He has such an ease on camera that it is rather mundane to state, but he looks like a natural on screen. Here he gets to emote in a different way than his previous other (6) roles. His youthfulness limits the types of roles that he gets to play so to see him show another side of a teen developing into a young man, is refreshing.In only a manner of time, there is undoubtedly  a full starring role for him waiting in the wings. He has taken on some solid supporting roles in his previous works (""Life Support"", ""Gardens of the Night"", ""Pride"", ""ATL"", etc.). He is now clearly ready for the camera to focus solely on his amazing talents.He literally steals the show in this affecting role. The  movie could have taken the traditional path but it makes an effective, if not, startling progression. His eyes are those classic ""Ross"" eyes and he clearly has inherited his mother's natural abilities on screen.He is just a moment away from that break through role. ""ATL"" is in constant replay on BET and TVONE. ""Life Support"" has gotten a strong amount of airplay on HBO. So his face is becoming more and more familiar.......out of all the movies on his slate, that breakthrough role is sitting, waiting to be enjoyed by his building fan base and those ready to discover an amazing new talent, one, Mr. Evan Olaf Ross-Naess.Thanks to the appearances and performances from Ellen Burstyn, Melissa Leo and Mr. Ross, the movie earns another viewing. Though it never got a full theatrical run, it deserves a closer look as a rental, if only to watch the fascinating development of Evan Ross.",4,Another Budding Showcase for Evan Ross,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,3459,"['Somewhere', 'screenplay', 'Ms.', 'Duff', 'performance', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'power', 'film', 'almost', 'undermined', 'Miss', 'Duff', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'clearly', 'found', 'story', 'appealing', 'However', 'closer', 'look', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'winning', 'qualities', 'endeavor', 'Miss', 'Duff', 'unclear', 'how', 'embrace', 'role', 'Should', 'portray', 'character', 'youthful', 'recklessness', 'reflection', 'what', 'audience', 'would', 'expect', 'will', 'allow', 'role', 'provide', 'bridge', 'be', 'searching', 'teen', 'idol', 'serious', 'actress', 'script', 'slow', 'reveal', 'where', 'movie', 'gravitas', 'part', 'problem', 'writer', 's', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'comfortable', 'taking', 'bold', 'leap', 'story', 'cautiousness', 'movie', 'just', 'right', 'movie', 'week', 'television', 'fare', 'addition', 'Ms.', 'Burstyn', 'Ms.', 'Leo', 'also', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'built', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'bright', 'sparkling', 'career', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'shine', 'first', 'semi-romantic', 'lead', 'Evan', 'character', 'Julie', 'mature', 'remorseful', 'loving', 'Ms.', 'Duff', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'bad', 'girl', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'opportunity', 'stretch', 'move', 'more', 'adult', 'roles', 'Instead', 'off', 'looking', 'spoiled', 'undeserving', 'brat', 'one', 'first', 'more', 'arresting', 'scenes', 'when', 'callously', 'how', 'Julie', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'learned', 'cook', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'scene', 'up', 'Ms.', 'Duff', 'Greta', 'more', 'substance', 'play', 'off', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actress', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'role', 'grandmother', 'Perhaps', 'intentional', 'affection', 'shared', 'husband', 'seniors', 'still', 'capable', 'loving', 'unique', 'cinema', 'today.Evan', 'Ross', 'impressive', 'resume', 'films', '25', 'stage', 'development/production', 'ease', 'camera', 'rather', 'mundane', 'state', 'natural', 'screen', 'Here', 'emote', 'different', 'way', 'previous', 'other', '6', 'roles', 'youthfulness', 'types', 'roles', 'play', 'so', 'see', 'show', 'side', 'teen', 'developing', 'young', 'man', 'refreshing.In', 'only', 'manner', 'time', 'undoubtedly', 'full', 'starring', 'role', 'waiting', 'wings', 'taken', 'solid', 'supporting', 'roles', 'previous', 'works', 'Life', 'Support', 'Gardens', 'Night', 'Pride', 'ATL', 'etc.', 'now', 'clearly', 'ready', 'camera', 'focus', 'solely', 'amazing', 'talents.He', 'literally', 'show', 'affecting', 'role', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'traditional', 'path', 'effective', 'not', 'startling', 'progression', 'eyes', 'are', 'classic', 'Ross', 'eyes', 'clearly', 'inherited', 'mother', 'natural', 'abilities', 'screen.He', 'just', 'moment', 'away', 'break', 'role', 'ATL', 'constant', 'replay', 'BET', 'TVONE', 'Life', 'Support', 'gotten', 'strong', 'amount', 'airplay', 'HBO', 'face', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'familiar', 'movies', 'slate', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'building', 'fan', 'base', 'ready', 'discover', 'amazing', 'new', 'talent', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Evan', 'Olaf', 'Ross-Naess.Thanks', 'appearances', 'performances', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Mr.', 'Ross', 'movie', 'viewing', 'never', 'got', 'full', 'theatrical', 'run', 'closer', 'look', 'rental', 'only', 'watch', 'fascinating', 'development', 'Evan', 'Ross']",According to Greta
1289160,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,B002TZS58S,Leif Sheppard,"[1, 1]","Hilary Duff's career mission to remain relevant past her teens doesn't gain an awful lot from this film. It's a vanity piece for Duff, who plays a maladjusted and disaffected teenager with a loving family who consistently rejects anything reasonably nice in her life. Once she details her personal suicide pact to her grandparents, she proudly concludes with the notion that they ""won't have Greta to kick around anymore"". Just who is so adamantly opposing her must be immaterial, because in reality she is impudent, sarcastic, and just generally obnoxious. I suppose her personality is intended to be 'lovingly sassy', but the screenplay fails miserably in this department. Greta commits a sin worse than being an unlikeable character, she's simply boring and uninteresting. She's a spoiled infant with no genuine problems, using an event from her past to continually push away those closest to her and essentially just behave like a child.For teenagers, however, this film will probably strike a chord. It's unlikely they'll question overmuch the items I just mentioned, preferring instead to relate with Greta because they, too, have some sort of dark teenage angst to work out. For it's target audience, there are a myriad of high notes this film strikes. Greta's character arc is nicely realized and her burgeoning romance with a co-worker is pleasant to watch unfold. There's some fine life lessons for teenagers here, along with some moments of genuine humor, and an open yet satisfying conclusion.

Hilary Duff gives a realistic performance as the title character, a 17-year-old who's trying to figure out who she wants to be in the midst of a troubled, broken family. Her mother seems to care only about her current relationship, and her father killed himself when she was very young. Greta's mother ships her off to stay with her Gram (wonderfully played by the talented Ellen Burstyn) and Gramps (an enigmatic Michael Murphy) in the small town of Ocean Grove, New Jersey, for the summer. Greta views her stay as 'an imprisonment' and sets out to be a total bad girl, but does find some redeeming moments as the movie progresses.In her journal which she keeps with her at all times, Greta keeps two lists: one of things she wants to do before she dies and one of suicide methods. Greta's grandparents both try to help her, but really don't know how to deal with a depressed teenager. Greta meets Julie, a black teenager who was once in juvenile detention is now a short-order cook with dreams of becoming a chef, and the two begin the age old dance of romance. Just when we think that Greta's relationship with Julie has helped her to mature, the bottom falls out.

I genuinely like Hilary Duff, but her acting in this, especially the beginning of the movie, was downright awful. I rarely complain about the acting talents of anyone, but it was mechanical and I felt like I was reading the script. The storyline itself is dark(lots of talk of suicide.) Somewhere in this movie, I should have found the main character, Greta, to be likable, but it never happened. Instead, I loathed her. Maybe it was the ""acting"", maybe it was Hilary Duff, maybe it was the writing? Everything else in this movie seemed to click, everything but the principle character. hmm.The real stars of this movie are Ellen Burstyn and Evan Ross.

They are both shore towns and she plays suicidal teen who is sent by her mother played by Melissa Leo to her maternal grandparents, Joseph and Katherine in Ocean Grove, a predominantly retirement community. Her grandparents are played by Michael Murphy and the wonderful Ellen Burstyn. She intends to but heads. She lives in a house where there is no cable and dial-up internet access. As for the movie, it's a coming of age story set on the Jersey Shore and I don't recognize Hilary Duff in her role as Greta. She does a brilliant job.I am saddened to know that this film wasn't even distributed widely enough. Maybe HBO should express interest in showing this film. It has a good script, solid cast, and is memorable. It has a PG-13 rating, no profanity, and one kissing scene between Greta and her male love interest, a line cook at a seafood restaurant with an interesting past.I live in New Jersey so I enjoyed watching the locales.

1289179,A1CVFUQ1PGSIJL,B002TZS58S,"T. Adlam ""professional consumer""","[0, 0]","The movie opens with a monologue spoken by Greta (Hilary Duff) expressing her disdain for having to move in with her grandparents; it's also when we learn that Greta's goal is to complete a type of bucket list which finishes off with suicide. This was a movie with powerful potential, especially since the topic of teen suicide is an important one. Unfortunately the execution wasn't as strong as it could be. There were three problems with the movie: inconsistent acting, a mediocre screenplay, and haphazard editing.As far as the acting, Hilary Duff excelled in certain areas of the movie, for instance when she began working as a waitress and toward the end of the film when she opened up to her grandparents. But more than a few times, her acting came off as disingenuous. I was surprised, however, by Evan Ross, who plays Julie, Greta's love interest. His acting, though also inconsistent, was better than I expected. Ellen Burstyn, who played Greta's grandmother, was completely believable in her role and her experience definitely shines through.The screenplay hindered this movie more than helped it. The development of the relationship between Greta and Julie seemed far too rushed and before I knew it, before the two really *did* anything together, they were already as close as two peas in a pod. Part of me suspects that this had more to do with editing than the screenplay itself. Overall, the movie would have been stronger if they played the romantic angle (since it is pegged as a romantic drama) more than they did.On a more positive note, I truly enjoyed the art direction of the film. The opening credits, along with the DVD's menu, played off a collage journal theme. The DVD also offered special features, which includes a behind the scenes look at filming the movie (which was more interesting than I expected it to be), an alternate ending, and some deleted scenes. In terms of language and risque situations, it's quite tame. The message that the film imparts--that life truly is worth living--is certainly a good one and I'd have no problem recommending it. But overall, the film didn't live up to its potential.",3,"Inconsistent Acting, Mediocre Screenplay, But a Good Message [3.5 Stars]",1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,2138,"['movie', 'monologue', 'spoken', 'Greta', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'expressing', 'disdain', 'having', 'move', 'grandparents', 'also', 'when', 'learn', 'Greta', 'goal', 'complete', 'type', 'bucket', 'list', 'suicide', 'was', 'movie', 'powerful', 'potential', 'especially', 'topic', 'teen', 'suicide', 'important', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'execution', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'could', 'be', 'were', 'three', 'problems', 'movie', 'inconsistent', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'screenplay', 'haphazard', 'editing.As', 'far', 'acting', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'excelled', 'certain', 'areas', 'movie', 'instance', 'when', 'began', 'working', 'waitress', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'opened', 'up', 'grandparents', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'acting', 'came', 'off', 'disingenuous', 'was', 'surprised', 'however', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'who', 'Julie', 'Greta', 'love', 'interest', 'acting', 'also', 'inconsistent', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'played', 'Greta', 'grandmother', 'was', 'completely', 'believable', 'role', 'experience', 'definitely', 'through.The', 'screenplay', 'hindered', 'movie', 'more', 'helped', 'development', 'relationship', 'Greta', 'Julie', 'seemed', 'far', 'too', 'rushed', 'knew', 'two', 'really', '*did*', 'anything', 'together', 'were', 'already', 'as', 'close', 'two', 'peas', 'pod', 'Part', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'editing', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'played', 'romantic', 'angle', 'pegged', 'romantic', 'drama', 'more', 'did.On', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'art', 'direction', 'film', 'opening', 'credits', 'DVD', 'menu', 'played', 'off', 'collage', 'journal', 'theme', 'DVD', 'also', 'offered', 'special', 'features', 'scenes', 'look', 'filming', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'expected', 'be', 'alternate', 'ending', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'terms', 'language', 'risque', 'situations', 'quite', 'tame', 'message', 'film', 'imparts', 'life', 'truly', 'worth', 'living', 'certainly', 'good', 'one', ""'d"", 'have', 'problem', 'recommending', 'overall', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential']",According to Greta
1289180,A312UBIOP091MH,B002TZS58S,Teacher Jeanne,"[1, 2]","In the beginning of this movie, Hilary's character is riding on the bus to her grandparent's house, where she is to be exiled.  She was writing in her journal and whining about being sent to New Jersey for the summer.  It was trying really hard to sound like Juno, where the characters are way smarter and use a larger vocabulary than most teens.  She began talking about killing herself and I almost wanted her to!  Hilary Duff as the angst ridden teen wasn't her usual role and I immediately thought she was in over her head.That being said, as the film progressed we learned more about her and why she is a rebellious girl contemplating suicide. The character has a death list in her journal as she contemplates ways to off herself before she graduates high school. She actually does a really good job of being an abrasive and troubled 17 year old.  I would agree with other reviews and say that this is her best role so far.  She showed she could stretch herself into different roles and not just be the perky girl in her films.  She gave the character depth and I actually grew to like her and want her to work it all out.The character, Greta, pushes everyone away by pushing them to the edge.  She wants everything her way and she makes no apologizes for that.  She steam rolls right over her grandparents with her curfew and cable tv, just to name a couple.  She even steam rolls a restaurant owner to hire her as a waitress with no experience and a bad attitude.  Then she meets a young man with a troubled past who helps her see that things can change, but only if you change them.  That begins her transformation.I cried during this movie, I admit it.  I couldn't believe that a Hilary Duff movie was making me cry.  All I can say is that I liked it.  I wouldn't recommend this to young Hilary Duff viewers at all.  It is not a light movie.
