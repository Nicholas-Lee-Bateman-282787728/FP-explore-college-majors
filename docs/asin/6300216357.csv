220891,A3M3FG82ZE1J8I,6300216357,"Ed N ""Ed""","[5, 6]","Hello all!  I must first admit that I like a lot of the Disney animated films.  Sleeping Beauty is probably my favorite.  I also like a lot of the Japanese anime, of which Princess Mononoke and Ghost in the Shell and Akira are my favorites.  This film, Charlotte's Web, is actually a 1970's Hanna-Barbara production and looks like one moreso than the graceful, delicate Disney animation style or techno Japanese style.  That being said, I think this is one of the best animated films ever released.The reasons it succeeds are multi-fold.  First, it is based on a classic children's story and is very faithful to the story.  Furthermore, it does a superb job telling the story - Disney films tend to concentrate around special effects and musical production numbers nowadays, but Charlotte's Web emphasizes the story, which makes it a superior product.  Granted, the animation is not up to Disney standard, but everything else is.  Also, the songs are very good - I can still remember the lyrics and tunes now, even though it's been ages since I saw the film.  The story is not childish and doesn't insult our intelligence - anyone who has read the EB White novel knows that the ending is rather poignant, and as I said, the film is quite faithful, as it deals with a lot of serious themes. To those who have not read the novel, it is basically about the friendship between a farm pig (Wilbur) and a common spider (Charlotte) and how she works to save Wilbur from the slaughterhouse.Okay, it's a strange concept for a novel or a film, but it works!

But nowadays not only do we have the classics, but we have the modern films and everything in between.  The selection is great.Of course I thought this movie would fit well into my extensive family DVD collection, but the picture is so grainy and dirty that it reminded me of a library book so covered in food stains and spots that I don't even want to read it anymore.As far as the movie, I felt uncomfortable to have my kids watch something so loaded with talk of killing and death.  I was hoping this would be a good pic for kids ages 8 and under since so many kid films have violence and suspenseful action sequences, but this movie would understandably raise tons of questions for my 4 year old, and I'm not ready to have her go on and on about death and dying and the killing of animals for the bacon we eat.With so many great choices out there, there are a few films that are great choices for kids that can be suitable for younger viewers that are just breaking into movie watching.  For example, the latest release of Lady and the Tramp is a wonderful movie, and my daughter absolutely loved it.  The restoration of that picture was mind-blowing with how clean the transfer was, making it a pleasure to watch.I'm sure I'll break out Charlotte's Web one day, but it won't be until they're old enough, like I was when watching it, to understand death and the like of farm animals.

220909,AGAR2DLEA4FF5,6300216357,"Lisa Ebeling ""laa-laa""","[91, 96]","I'm amazed that the animated film &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; is almost thirty years old, but it's as wonderful today as when it was released  (1973) and the production values equal those that we judge children's films  by even today. This movie is the only animated version of E.B. White's  novel by the same name (c. 1952) that I've found. The novel was a 1953 John  Newbery Honor book (not the 1st-place prize, the &quot;Newbery Medal&quot;  but one of the runners-up). Hanna-Barbera produced a faithful rendering of  the novel, which is one of the reasons for the film's success.Another  reason for the enduring popularity of this VHS is the brilliant casting of  voice talent. The chief characters' voices are played by some of America's  most prolific actors of the early 1970s, including Rex Allen, Paul Lynde,  Agnes Moorehead, Debbie Reynolds, Henry Gibson, and Pamelyn Ferdin.  Don't  remember some of these people? Here are some reminders:The late Rex  Allen (narrator) was the quintessential dispassionate narrator of so many  Walt Disney nature specials and made many early movies; late comedian Paul  Lynde (rat), who is the only Templeton I can ever imagine as he's the only  actor I think has mastered the art of the &quot;verbal sneer,&quot; had his  own variety show; the late Agnes Moorehead (goose), played Endora the witch  on the &quot;Bewitched&quot; series and had parts in over 70 feature films;  tiresomely-perky Debbie Reynolds (Charlotte), known for movie musicals and  dancing, is fairly inoffensive in this movie, even during the relatively  brief vocal numbers; Henry Gibson (Wilbur), is a comedian whom you'll  remember from the TV series &quot;Laugh-In&quot;; and Pamelyn Ferdin  (Fern), who must have had voice lessons after she did the voice of Lucy Van  Pelt in &quot;You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; (what, 1969?) and  before she participated in this project--somehow she lost the  &quot;whine&quot; that makes her so distinguishable-- (Remember Pamelyn?  You can also easily pick her out in an old original-series &quot;Star  Trek&quot; episode in which she plays a SCARY child named Mary! Sorry, I'm  off the subject.)There's so much to love about this film. I always laugh  at the scene in which the goose encourages Wilbur to speak for the first  time and he grunts/oinks and then stammers,  &quot;W-w-w-w-w-w-Wilbur! &quot; (Overlook that he immediately discovers  that not only can he talk, but he can SING!) Gibson's portrayal of Wilbur,  the shy, queasy, litle-bit-naive young pig is very endearing, but his voice  isn't as distinctive as that of other actors of that era (George Lindsey,  for example). If someone ever re-makes &quot;Charlotte's Web,&quot; their  greatest obstacle to true success will be replacing Paul Lynde, the ideal  Templeton.Templeton staggering drunkenly back to Wilbur's crate after  gorging himself all night long at the fair is a classic scene. His grossly  distended belly seems to have a life of its own as it ripples and burbles  along independent of the movement of the rest of his body. Great  animation!I really like the score by a couple of guys named Sherman  (brothers?) and the orchestration by Irwin Kostal; in addition to the  expected lively numbers, there are some very nice gentle songs, one of  which is beautifully sung by a men's choir. My own favorite number is the  one sung by a barbershop quartet (a genre which deserves more attention  than it gets) at the fair.Even though this film is so &quot;old,&quot;  I think it was used as casting inspiration by CBS/Endemol when they  selected George Boswell for &quot;Big Brother.&quot; My favorite scene is  an exchange between Mrs. Zuckerman and her husband as they discuss the  meaning of Charlotte's first spiderweb message. Edith: &quot;Seems to me  you're a little off; seems to me we have no ordinary spider.&quot; Homer:  &quot;No, it's just a common grey spider. See? It's sittin' right  there.&quot; If &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; is made into a live-action  film, BB's George would be ideal for the role of dim-witted, understated  Homer Zuckerman. George even looks like the cartoon character!On a more  serious note, Charlotte's straightforward attitude about her approaching  death offers an opportunity to talk with children about death. This movie  also presented my first chance to talk with my son (almost 4) about where  meat comes from. When the Arabels discuss Wilbur being turned into bacon  and ham, my boy was quite curious. He seemed alarmed, but so far hasn't  refused to eat meat!So if you don't already have a copy of  &quot;Charlotte's Web,&quot; buy this video before it's taken out of  circulation; it's a gem  you'll want in your collection. Need a memorable  birthday or holiday gift for a child? You can't go wrong with a classic  movie, and this is sure to be a favorite--as you will be if you give  &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; to a lucky boy or girl.",5,Delightful rendition of the 1952 classic

Eventually the hapless curly-tail is sold to the Zuckerman Farm, where he meets an interesting assortment of characters: There's a rude ram (Dave Madden), a gabby goose (Agnes Moorehead), and a ravenous rat (Paul Lynde) named Templeton; but lonely Wilbur finds a true friend in the kindly, wise spider who lives in an upper corner of the pigpen. The spider is called Charlotte (Debbie Reynolds) and once she learns that sweet and shy Wilbur is in danger of becoming bacon bits, she spins the words ""Some Pig!"" in her web.Sweet story, soft and gentle animation, cleverly-written but sometimes annoying songs.Staci Layne WilsonAuthor ofAnimal Movies Guide",4,"""Some movie!""",1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,900,"['Wilbur', 'voiced', 'Henry', 'Gibson', 'porker', 'problem', 'was', 'born', 'runt', 'litter', 'farmer', 'John', 'Stephenson', 'not', 'worth', 'price', 'feed', 'farmer', 'daughter', 'Fern', 'Pamelyn', 'Ferdin', 'steps', 'Wilbur', 'pet', 'Eventually', 'hapless', 'curly-tail', 'sold', 'Zuckerman', 'Farm', 'where', 'interesting', 'assortment', 'characters', 'rude', 'ram', 'Dave', 'Madden', 'gabby', 'goose', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'ravenous', 'rat', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'named', 'Templeton', 'lonely', 'Wilbur', 'true', 'friend', 'kindly', 'wise', 'spider', 'who', 'upper', 'corner', 'pigpen', 'spider', 'called', 'Charlotte', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'once', 'sweet', 'shy', 'Wilbur', 'danger', 'becoming', 'bacon', 'bits', 'words', 'Pig', 'web.Sweet', 'story', 'soft', 'gentle', 'animation', 'cleverly-written', 'sometimes', 'annoying', 'songs.Staci', 'Layne', 'WilsonAuthor', 'ofAnimal', 'Movies', 'Guide']",N/A
220931,A35GHITTG3WX7E,6300216357,Taran Wanderer,"[2, 2]","Paramount Pictures brought for us a beautiful animated adaptation of one of the modest charming classics in modern American children's literature, ""Charlotte's Web"".  This 1973 production has grown on me since I first saw it years ago, shortly after finishing the original novel.  One could and would say, perhaps, that the film suffers from a few flaws, one of which is weaker animation than what one may be accustomed to.  Though, compared to Disney's 1973 output, ""Robin Hood"", ""Charlotte's Web"" isn't really too disappointing in terms of technical quality.  The film captures the essence of the story beautifully, adding charm to it without altering the original.  Good memorable songs, good writing among other things make this a wonderful film for family viewing.Based on E.B. White's now-classic children's story of the same name, ""Charlotte's Web"" is the story of a little pig named Wilbur who was born a runt.  John Arable sees the size of the pig and decides that he must do away with it, for it would probably die anyways.  When Fern Arable, his daughter, hears of this, she is bewildered and shocked and begs to be allowed to keep the pig.  Mr. Arable is convinced and allows Fern to keep the pig, whom she names Wilbur, and the two become fast and loving friends.  Sadly for Fern, when Wilbur grows into a fine pig, Mr. Arable tells her that it is time for him to go and the pig is sent away down the road to Fern's uncle's farm.  At Mr. Zuckerman's barn, Wilbur makes a great deal of new friends, all of which are too busy to play with him.  Among his new companions are Templeton, a rat, a goose, sheep and other animals.  Though Wilbur finds his new home pleasant and beautiful, and he is visited often by Fern, he soon learns a terrible truth: when he grows fat and good enough to eat, Mr. Zuckerman will kill him for his meat.  Wilbur is shocked and frightened and determined that he wants to live.  The next day, Wilbur meets Charlotte, a beautiful, wise and intelligent gray spider who lives on the hollow doorway leading inside the barn.  Charlotte promises Wilbur to be his friend and that she'll try and save his life.  Very skilled with her spinerets and a good writer, Charlotte finds the perfect solution: to write small words on her web that'll capture the attention of the humans and let them know that Wilbur is one especial pig.  Charlotte's clever idea is successful and Mr. Zuckerman, his family and friends find the apparition of the messages to be unexplainable miracles.  Charlotte then dedicates her life to her good friend, and with the help of Templeton the rat, sees that Wilbur's life is placed out of harm's way, thus giving a bold meaning to her own life as well.Touching and bittersweet from beginning to end, the story of ""Charlotte's Web"" is one that never ceases to enchant me as both sweet and tragic.  Like many other delightful children's stories, the theme of ""the circle of life"" is present here and is carried out marvelously.  There's also a strong message about friendship as well as the miracles of life and death.  The Sherman Brothers, responsible for the scores to such Disney classics as ""The Sword in the Stone"" (1963), ""Mary Poppins"" (1964), ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971) and ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" (1977), give this film its musical appeal through a delightful score, which captures the both the joy and purity of the happiest and also the most touching scenes, as well as a handful of wonderful songs; most notably, ""Charlotte's Web"" and ""Mother Earth and Father Time"", both songs which set out two important themes for this delightful musical story.  Tough some of the vocal work could be considered clich&eacute;d, the script is fantastic.  Debbie Reynolds gives her voice to Charlotte the spider, and many of her lines of wisdom stay with me when the film is over; ""I'm thinking of your life, Wilbur.  Nothing can harm you now."" at the same time, chilling me to the bone.  Seeing this film before going to sleep for me means troubled sleep, for the tragic, yet happy, story of Charlotte and Wilbur haunts me for a long time after every time I watch it.  Some parents could be disturbed by this if their children felt the same way, but to me, the best films out there are not the ones that make you laugh out loud, or that feature incredible animation, but rather, films that can awaken in you strong emotions that live within you for a long time, that's what the best of stories are made of.  Charlotte's Web is a grand adaptation of E.B. White's classic story that should not be missed, even if you've skipped it to see the2006 version, of which I can say nothing as I haven't seen it.

Francois ""tfrancois""","[2, 2]","Sometimes, while living our lives and going through our normal daily routines in adult life, we come across something by accident that takes you back to fond memories of your childhood.  For me, one of those things is this timeless masterpiece by E.B. White.  While channel surfing the other day, I came across an afternoon showing of this movie and found myself enjoying it just as much, if not more so, than when I used to watch it as a kid.  Memories of happier, care-free days as a child all came flooding back and left me with a warm, fuzzy feeling and kinda made my day.  I highly recommend you sharing this movie with any kid in your life and I guarantee it will be an experience that will forever be a part of their lives.  The story is so endearing, powerful, and transforming (particularly to young, impressionable minds) that the experience of viewing it for the first time will be unforgettable.I also want to add that most reviewers commented on the dated animation quality in this film and I can't tell you how much I disagree with this.  The movie's story is the most compelling part of the movie as well as the superb acting voices used in the film.  The pictures are almost secondary but absolutely adequate, and I believe, at times extremely appropriate.  It goes to show how a timeless classic that is well done does not have to rely on special effects and visual wizardry to tell a good story.  In my opinion, the artwork and animation suits the movie extremely well and is visually satisfying.  It also helps keep the viewer focused on the story and its characters as opposed to the visual elements of the production.I love and appreciate this film now as an adult just as much as I did when I was a child and can't wait to someday share it with my kids.
