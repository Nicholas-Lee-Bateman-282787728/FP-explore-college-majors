Highly recommended.  Elmo is so cute and the kids love Mr Noodle and the short films featuring other children. Would recommend this one.,5,A great DVD for everyone,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,265,"['10-month-old', 'loves', 'video', 'rest', 'family', 'too', 'thank', 'goodness', ""'ve"", 'sure', 'had', 'watch', 'enough', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Elmo', 'so', 'cute', 'kids', 'love', 'Mr', 'Noodle', 'short', 'films', 'featuring', 'other', 'children', 'Would', 'recommend', 'one']",N/A
681510,A2RNUPVSNW1ZXX,B00005T322,Heather Walton,"[18, 19]","This DVD is taken right from Sesame Street Elmo's World segments. 3 segments- 1)Birds, 2)Bugs and 3)bicycles. There is no added segments other then these three. Still it is good and the picture and sound quality can't be beat. My daughter likes the bird segment the best. There are lots of puppet birds as well as real birds. The bug segment has mostly puppet bugs and a few real bugs a girl seeks out in her backyard. The bicycle segment is the most involved with kids riding bikes, songs about bikes and Mr. Noodle's brother mr. Noodle riding a bike in his comical way. A very good show for youngsters and a very good price. ...I too prefer the Babies, Dogs and More video, but it does not come in a DVD so this one has the advantage and the content is almost as good.",5,Very good show for toddlers,1014768000,"02 27, 2002",2002,770,"['DVD', 'taken', 'right', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Elmo', 'World', 'segments', '3', 'segments-', '1', 'Birds', '2', 'Bugs', '3', 'bicycles', 'added', 'segments', 'other', 'then', 'three', 'Still', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'daughter', 'bird', 'segment', 'best', 'are', 'lots', 'puppet', 'birds', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'birds', 'bug', 'segment', 'mostly', 'puppet', 'bugs', 'few', 'real', 'bugs', 'girl', 'out', 'backyard', 'bicycle', 'segment', 'most', 'involved', 'kids', 'riding', 'bikes', 'songs', 'bikes', 'Mr.', 'Noodle', 'brother', 'mr.', 'Noodle', 'riding', 'bike', 'comical', 'way', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'youngsters', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'too', 'prefer', 'Babies', 'Dogs', 'More', 'video', 'not', 'come', 'DVD', 'one', 'advantage', 'content', 'almost', 'as', 'good']",N/A

He loves Elmo and counts and sings along with him during the video. I think that  Elmo's songs could be a little more inventive, (when Elmo sits at his piano and just repeats the same word over and over I think it's odd--couldn't anyone write a chorus?) but that is my only complaint. Good, safe entertainment for toddlers is hard to find.",5,Very good for young children,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,431,"['have', 'purchased', 'most', 'Elmo', 'World', 'DVDs', 'toddler', 'who', 'three', 'years', 'age', 'Elmo', 'counts', 'sings', 'video', 'think', 'Elmo', 'songs', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'inventive', 'when', 'Elmo', 'piano', 'just', 'repeats', 'same', 'word', 'think', 'odd', 'could', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'write', 'chorus', 'only', 'complaint', 'Good', 'safe', 'entertainment', 'toddlers', 'hard', 'find']",N/A
