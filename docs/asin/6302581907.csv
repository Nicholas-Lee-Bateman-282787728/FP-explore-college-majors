It is funny and heartwarming.It is about a lounge singer named Dolores(Whoopi Goldberg) who witnessed a murder crime from her lover Vince. Now she has to hide out in a convent until the police can catch Vince before he kills Dolores.Now Dolores is Sister Mary Clarence. She meets nuns with different personalities and also nuns that can't sing good. Clarence saves the nuns choir by being the leader of the choir. She did a good job that you will love the music they sing and the soundtrack.I just recommend this movie to anybody. This is one of my favorite comedies because Whoopi is in it.

She's linked to a married man, who just so happens to be a wanted criminal, and when she witnesses something she wasn't supposed to, she going into immediate hiding.

Her shady backstory is replaced by a fake one, so as to keep the innocence of the rest of the nuns, and soon she is making a bigger impact than she even thought she would, especially in the choir department.`Sister Act' is a rousing good time that hands Goldberg a plum role for her kind of humor.  She's cleaner than usual, but with the edge needed to give this staying power and make it believable.  The rest of the supporting cast is clearly up for the challenge as well, with Maggie Smith giving her usual cranky turn and Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena serving up hilarity as the worldly un-wise `sisters'.

Whoopi Goldberg is clearly the reason, but she brings out the best in the other actresses (and the few actors) as well. Maggie Smith is even more starched as the mother superior than she is as Professor McGonagall.Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi) was a singer in Reno when her gangster boyfriend Vince (Harvey Keitel) committed a murder. She just happened to walk into his office as it happened, and witnessed it. She ran straight to the police, who agreed to hide her if she would testify against Vince. Fine, but where they decide to hide her is in a convent.The mother superior (Maggie Smith) insists she cannot hide there unless she wears a habit and assumes the role of a nun. She invents a cover story about being transferred from a different convent, and names her Sister Mary Clarence.Deloris, coming off the glamor of a stage career in Reno, is bored, feels confined and rebellious.For punishment when she misbehaves (not going to tell you the nature of her misbehavior; that's part of the fun I don't want to give away), Mother Superior assigns her to the choir. She has already witnessed just how bad the choir is, so it seems like punishment.But in no time at all, she is able to teach them how to sing. In doing so, she demonstrates that she knows a good bit more about music than she ever showed in her rather pathetic Reno act. The problem is, they are not content to sing conventional hymns. She gets them singing jazzed-up versions of love songs to God and to Jesus.But Vince's thugs are still looking for her. There is a spy for Vince in the police department who gets the exact address of the convent and gives it to Vince. The chase is on.It gets a little hard to believe, but it is great fun.

Yet fortunately I did not have any preconceived notions of SISTER ACT when I first rented it years and years ago and brought it home, where my kids just ate it up.

Over the years I've watched this movie on several occasions, and it still entertains and charms my curmudgeonly soul.Ask John Q. Public which movie Whoopi Goldberg is best known for, and I'll bet the farm he'll tell you SISTER ACT.  Goldberg is a hoot in the lead role, because here she can be her characteristic over-the-top, and it works.  The supporting cast compliments Goldberg handsomely, from Maggie Smith to Harvey Keitel to a vocally-enhanced Kathy Najimy--but most of all Mary Wickes as a good-natured yet grumpy and crusty Sister Lazarus (she steals, then chews up, every scene she's in).

321308,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6302581907,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[1, 1]","In watching Sister Act again recently (for the first time since I was ordained), there was a particular scene that reminded me of the power of the clericals -- the thugs in the final chase refused to shoot Delores because she was dressed as a nun; they couldn't shoot, in case she was a nun. Even though they were fairly confident that she wasn't a nun, the image she presented was one of being holy, and thus they couldn't bring themselves to do it. The combination of that scene with the nuns running through the casino, and working their way onto the flight, reminded me of my recent experiences in my collar.Recently I had to attend a function at an exclusive club in Indianapolis. I had been to this club before (always dressed very well, three-piece suit or sharp business-formal double-breasted, etc.) and had always been stopped at the door, asked who I was and where I was going, etc. This last time I was wearing my collar. The door was opened, I was greeted ('good afternoon, Father') and left to wander about the club as I pleased.A few days later, at a retirement party for faculty members from my seminary, I again wore my collar for the formal event. As the serving staff were putting out the plates for us, I noticed that they served the women first (proper etiquette), but then they served me as a separate stage before proceeding to the other gentlemen at the table (none of whom were wearing clericals).People are far more deferential to me now. I can get away with a lot more. Hmmmm...Oh well. Just a brief observation. On to the movie...I've loved this film since the first time I saw it. From the beginning transition of Delores as a schoolgirl to Delores (Whoopi Goldberg) the casino show girl, to the exciting chase of nuns and villians throug the casino, and the 'happy ending' packaging, it all works.Delores van Cartier (as anyone of that name probably should be!) is a showgirl in a casino. She has had the misfortune to fall into a love affair with a casino-owner being investigated by the police for various crimes, including murder (I know, unheard of, surely, but hey, this is fiction!).Delores is an eye witness to one murder, and thus goes on the run. She contacts the police, and one particular policeman places her in a convent in another city, where she, masquerading as a nun, would live a quiet and cloistered life, out of public view, and safe from the criminals who are by this time scouring the country looking for her, dead or alive.When Delores arrives at the convent, it is as much of a culture shock to her as she is to the culture of the convent, especially as that is envisioned and embodied by the Reverend Mother (played astutely by Maggie Smith). After a period of 'adjustment', the Reverend Mother finally decided that there is no place in the convent that 'Sister Mary Clarence' really fits into well, but perhaps she could, given her musical career, do something with the rather disastrous choir at the convent.Delores/Mary Clarence does so reluctantly, but after a few false starts, instills confidence in the choir members, and introduces a 'showtune' element into their repertoire as well (much to the amazement, nay, horror of the Reverend Mother). It has the side effect, however, of drawing people and attention to the church. The church grows, and the choir continues its ascending popularity, while the Reverend Mother grows increasingly worried over the changes in her convent and the jeopardy such attention may bring to Delores' need for a safe haven.The musical variations, combinations of hymnody and popular songs, really helps carry the story through its hilarious stages. 'I will follow him' is perhaps my favourite combination piece. According to the promotional material, she turns the nuns' tone-deaf choir into a soulful chorus of swingin', singing sisters. In the end, the music draws such attention to the church of St. Catherine that the Pope decided to visit.Supporting casts members include Havey Keitel as the casino-owner; Kathy Najimy as Sister Mary Patrick; and veteran actress Mary Wickes as Sister Mary Lazarus.A happy ending is assured, as indeed is a sequel, with yet more nunnery nonsense.",5,"Nun of that, now...",1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,4177,"['watching', 'Sister', 'Act', 'again', 'recently', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'ordained', 'was', 'particular', 'scene', 'reminded', 'power', 'clericals', 'thugs', 'final', 'chase', 'refused', 'shoot', 'Delores', 'was', 'dressed', 'nun', 'could', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'case', 'was', 'nun', 'Even', 'were', 'fairly', 'confident', 'was', ""n't"", 'nun', 'image', 'presented', 'was', 'one', 'being', 'holy', 'thus', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do', 'combination', 'scene', 'nuns', 'running', 'casino', 'working', 'way', 'flight', 'reminded', 'recent', 'experiences', 'collar.Recently', 'had', 'attend', 'function', 'exclusive', 'club', 'Indianapolis', 'had', 'been', 'club', 'always', 'dressed', 'very', 'well', 'three-piece', 'suit', 'sharp', 'business-formal', 'double-breasted', 'etc', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'stopped', 'door', 'asked', 'who', 'was', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'etc', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'wearing', 'collar', 'door', 'was', 'opened', 'was', 'greeted', ""'good"", 'afternoon', 'Father', 'left', 'wander', 'club', 'pleased.A', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'retirement', 'party', 'faculty', 'members', 'seminary', 'again', 'wore', 'collar', 'formal', 'event', 'serving', 'staff', 'were', 'putting', 'out', 'plates', 'noticed', 'served', 'women', 'first', 'proper', 'etiquette', 'then', 'served', 'separate', 'stage', 'proceeding', 'other', 'gentlemen', 'table', 'none', 'whom', 'were', 'wearing', 'clericals', '.People', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'deferential', 'now', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'lot', 'more', 'Hmmmm', 'Oh', 'well', 'Just', 'brief', 'observation', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'beginning', 'transition', 'Delores', 'schoolgirl', 'Delores', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'casino', 'show', 'girl', 'exciting', 'chase', 'nuns', 'villians', 'throug', 'casino', ""'happy"", 'ending', 'packaging', 'van', 'Cartier', 'anyone', 'name', 'probably', 'should', 'be', 'showgirl', 'casino', 'had', 'misfortune', 'fall', 'love', 'affair', 'casino-owner', 'being', 'investigated', 'police', 'various', 'crimes', 'including', 'murder', 'know', 'unheard', 'surely', 'hey', 'fiction', 'eye', 'witness', 'one', 'murder', 'thus', 'run', 'police', 'one', 'particular', 'policeman', 'convent', 'city', 'where', 'masquerading', 'nun', 'would', 'live', 'quiet', 'cloistered', 'life', 'public', 'view', 'safe', 'criminals', 'who', 'are', 'time', 'scouring', 'country', 'looking', 'dead', 'alive.When', 'arrives', 'convent', 'as', 'much', 'culture', 'shock', 'culture', 'convent', 'especially', 'envisioned', 'embodied', 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'played', 'astutely', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'period', ""'adjustment"", 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'finally', 'decided', 'place', 'convent', ""'Sister"", 'Mary', 'Clarence', 'really', 'well', 'perhaps', 'could', 'given', 'musical', 'career', 'do', 'something', 'rather', 'disastrous', 'choir', 'convent.Delores/Mary', 'Clarence', 'so', 'reluctantly', 'few', 'false', 'starts', 'instills', 'confidence', 'choir', 'members', ""'showtune"", 'element', 'repertoire', 'well', 'much', 'amazement', 'nay', 'horror', 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'side', 'effect', 'however', 'drawing', 'people', 'attention', 'church', 'church', 'choir', 'ascending', 'popularity', 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'increasingly', 'worried', 'changes', 'convent', 'jeopardy', 'such', 'attention', 'may', 'bring', 'Delores', 'need', 'safe', 'haven.The', 'musical', 'variations', 'combinations', 'hymnody', 'popular', 'songs', 'really', 'carry', 'story', 'hilarious', 'stages', 'will', 'follow', 'perhaps', 'favourite', 'combination', 'piece', 'According', 'promotional', 'material', 'nuns', 'tone-deaf', 'choir', 'soulful', 'chorus', 'swingin', 'singing', 'sisters', 'end', 'music', 'draws', 'such', 'attention', 'church', 'St.', 'Catherine', 'Pope', 'decided', 'visit.Supporting', 'casts', 'members', 'include', 'Havey', 'Keitel', 'casino-owner', 'Kathy', 'Najimy', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Patrick', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Lazarus.A', 'happy', 'ending', 'assured', 'indeed', 'sequel', 'yet', 'more', 'nunnery', 'nonsense']",N/A

321323,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6302581907,JGC,"[1, 1]","I love ""Sister Act"" almost as much as I love Whoop! This movie is just tailor-made for Whoop, isn't it! Whoopi is totally perfect, and hilarious in every single scene. This is also a great movie that your entire family will enjoy because it is very wholesome and has a great upbeat message. Whoopi Goldberg gave a very Oscar-worthy performance just as she did inGhost(another one of her best movies!) Perhaps the reason why she wasn't nominated though was because the role was too perfect, maybe the academy could not see where the character began and where the person ended?OK if you are one of the 2 people on the face of this planet who still have not seen ""Sister Act"" allow me to tell you what it's about. Whoopi plays Deloris Van Cartier, a fast-talking singer at a fleabag Reno casino. When she goes back to confront her married lover (Harvey Keitel plays the mobster-with-a-heart, Vince) she eyes a hit!Poor Deloris is literally rolling for her life when Vince sends his boys after her! Deloris finally makes it to the police and Lt. Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn) arranges a very secret (and funny) place to stick Deloris at! A convent, where else! The rest of the movie is all about sweet Catholic love! I could not stop laughing when the Reverend Mother (Maggie Smith) first met Deloris, complaining that ""this woman is designed to stick out.""Whoop now has a new home (a convent) and a new vocation (a nun!) and a new name. Everyone in the convent knows her as simply Sister Mary Clarence. All the nuns take to her immidaitley because Mary Clarence is a lot like Whoopi. She's sweet and funny and bubbly and doesn't know when to shut-up!I love the part when the Reverend Mother forced ""Mary Clarence"" to fast because she wouldn't stop talking. So funny! Pretty soon Mary Clarence decides to transform the chior into something halfway musical. My favorites in the choir are probably your favorites as well: the very bubbly and happy Sister Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy before she lost all that weight,) the somewhat meek nun-in-training Sister Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena) and the no-nonsense Sister Mary Lazarus (played by veteran character actress and everyone's favorite amorous neighbor, Miss Cathcart, otherwise known as Mary Wickes.)When Whoop decided to run out to the biker's bar (conveniently located adjacent to the convent) I could not stop laughing. It was actually Kathy Najimmy as Sister Mary Patrick who stole the show. She went absolutely nuts when she saw a jukebox and just had to have 1 dance.Over the course of her brief time there ""Sister Mary Clarence"" did a lot to change things in the convent and in the community. She actually went out and met people and got down on their level. She opened her church doors to all and like Jesus, had a ""come as you are"" philosophy. Mary Clarence also recruited the help of the convent, especially the girls from her choir. Everyone was very pleased with what  ""Sister Mary Clarence"" accomplished, except for the Reverend Mother who felt like it wasn't her place.Shockingly, Vince and his thugs were able to track down Whoop and came by to kidnap her! When the nuns found out, of course they all decided to go to Reno to save her. And as Sister Mary Patrick said: I bet Reno is just bursting with sin. Even the somewhat crotchety Reverend Mother got into the act guilting a charter company into flying them all in!The Sisters finally catch up to ""Mary Clarence,"" who by now, they all know is actually Deloris Van Cartier; said with a touch of sarcasm and a wave of her wrist and a sly look in her eye by Sister Mary Lazarus. When Vince's boys can't shoot Deloris he threatens to do it himself saying, ""I know that woman and she ain't no nun."" Of course the Reverend Mother defended Deloris again and assured Vince that she was in fact a real nun.As I sated, I absolutely love this movie. It is so funny and the singing and performances by all are second to nun (pardon the pun!) And I think Whoopi actually sang some of the songs, but I could be incorrect. I also enjoyed this movie very much because it had some great life-affirming lessons.

Not only is there an abundance of very funny humor, the plot keeps moving along and that held my attention really well. The musical score with that magical touch of Marc Shaiman greatly enhances the film; I also liked the choreography and the cinematography. The acting was very convincing, too!When the film starts, we meet the lead singer of a going-nowhere-fast group singing at The Nevada Club in Reno, Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg). Unfortunately for Deloris, her troubles don't end there. She is romantically mixed up with mobster Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel), who won't leave his wife for Deloris despite all his promises to do so. Deloris gets a purple mink coat from Vince; but when it turns out to be his wife's coat; Deloris is angry and she wants to return the coat to Vince at once. But just as Deloris arrives at Vince's office upstairs at the club, she witnesses a hit by Joey (Robert Miranda) and Willy (Richard Portnow), two of Vince's ""assistants."" Vince now knows Deloris has to be killed too so she will never be able to testify against him in court--and therefore he will escape prison.Deloris goes to the cops in the nick of time; Lt. Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn) places her in a type of witness protection program where Eddie thinks Vince and his gang will never look for her--in a San Francisco convent where the nuns are never allowed out because of the extremely strict rules set by The Mother Superior (Maggie Smith). Deloris must also assume the name of Sister Mary Clarence so the other nuns won't know she's really a lounge singer hiding from danger until she can testify and go free again. Eddie hopes to get Deloris out in a month or two tops so she can testify against Vince and then be a free woman once again; but of course Deloris hates every minute of it and right from the start she clashes big time with The Mother Superior.How everything plays out is the focus of the remainder of the film; suffice it to say that things do take a turn for the better when The Mother Superior assigns Deloris to the choir; she really molds them into a fantastic choir at that! There's plenty of action and even some suspense, too.Look for performances by Kathy Najimy as Sister Mary Patrick; Wendy Makkena as Sister Mary Robert; Mary Wickes as Sister Mary Lazarus; Joseph Maher as Bishop O'Hara and Guy Boyd as Detective Tate. Isis Carmen Jones has a brief cameo as a very young Deloris in Catholic School many years prior to all the action.The DVD comes with a making of featurette and two music videos.Sister Act is a great choice for people who love classic comedy; this film is as funny today as it was when it was originally released!

It has become one of my favorites since then. Whoopi plays Deloris Van Cartier, who is a Las Vegas lounge singer whose boyfriend is in the local mob. She walks in and sees him killing a previous employer who went to report him to the police. Deloris gets scared immediately, runs away from Vince's (Harvey Keitel) buddies who are told to ""take care of it"", meaning kill Deloris. She reports the incident to the police, and the lieutenant gets her into hiding for a short time until Vince goes to trial. Deloris is reluctant, but agrees to go. She is put in a place where Vince wouldn't even think she's at: a convent. She meets with the strict Reverend Mother (played by Maggie Smith), and has to adapt to the simple life of being a nun. She quickly befriends the rest of the sisters, and even manages to help get the convent out of alienation, as well as making the choir sing more beautifully (and even getting a very special visit from the Pope himself several days later). But shortly later on, Vince finds out of where Deloris is, because of some nosy detective, and the terror picks up where it left off. The lieutenant who put her in hiding now has to tell her that she has to leave because Vince knows of where she's at. She gets picked up by Vince's buddies and gets taken to a lounge and Vince is telling the boys to kill her. Deloris manages to get away from the men for a few minutes, and after a while, Vince and his boys are arrested and on their way to prison. Then, Mary Clarence and the rest of the sisters have their special concert at the church, with the Pope in attendance. After the concert, they all get a standing ovation, and the movie ends on a happy note. Filled with interesting scenes as well as great 60s soul music, this movie deserves to be in your personal library.

She's hilarious in it, especially when she finds out she can't get lucky - you're in a convent darling, and the nun's habit isn't likely to attract any guys!Sister Act has a marvellous cast, most of who came back for the sequel (which includes a young Lauryn Hill). Maggie Smith and Harvey Keitel are stand outs, Maggie playing an old-fashioned nun, who likes things done just right and Harvey plays an outrageous mobster. My two favourite nuns are Sister Mary Patrick (played by Kathy Najimy) and Sister Mary Robert (played by Wendy Makkena).Whoopi Goldberg originally starts up off playing a fed up lounge singer, who, when she goes into the convent, has to teach the choir how to sing. With hilarious results. There are a lot of fantastic songs in this including: ""My Guy"", ""I Will Follow Him"", ""Rescue Me"", and ""If My Sister's In Trouble"". Most of Sister Mary Robert's singing is absolutely fantastic, although I reckon it was a voice stand in, and not her own voice!!!!Surprisingly, there are extras on this DVD! A trailer, and 2 videos! Oh well, it's better than nothing - which is what I was expecting. The two videos are ""If My Sister's In Trouble"" by Lady Soul, featuring Sister Mary Patrick, and Sister Mary Robert, wearing their nun costumes, and rather a lot of makeup, and ""I Will Follow Him"", which is just a video made to promote the film.This is a brilliant film, although I can imagine some cynics out there not enjoying it!

321343,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6302581907,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 2]","""Sister Act"" is one of the funniest and best made films of the early 1990's.  Starring Whoopi Goldberg as Delores Van Cartier, (a lounge singer working in a Reno, Nevada casino) the film begins with a flashback showing a young and irreverent Delores in a Catholic parochial school being reprimanded by a nun after giving the names of the Beatles for the names of the apostles.  The nun warns Delores that she won't amount to much if she maintains her poor attitude.Returning to the present, we see the hapless Delores and her two back-up singers performing before a mostly empty audience in a Reno casino.  Unhappy with her career and her married boyfriend, Vince LaRocca (played by Harvey Keitel), Delores decides to leave, but Vince appeases her by giving her a mink coat.  When Delores discovers that the coat actually belongs to his wife, she tromps over to Vince's office, where she unwittingly sees Vince shoot one of his employees.  Sadly, Delores' unfortunate appearance did not go unnoticed as Vince orders his henchmen to get Delores.  She bolts out of Vince's office and into the casino where she manages to escape and flees to the police.Now knowing that her exboyfriend Vince is a gangster, police lieutenant Eddie Souther (played by Bill Nunn), tells Delores that she must enter the witness protection program to be safe until she can testify against Vince.  Eddie takes Delores to San Francisco so that she can assume her new identity as a nun in a convent.After Eddie leaves, the very unhappy Delores cannot hide her horror of being a nun and Mother Superior (played by Maggie Smith) is not thrilled with the situation either.  You can't help but laugh while watching Mother Superior's attempts to find a suitable place for Delores (now known as Sister Mary Clarence) within the convent or Delores' disgust with ""looking like a penguin,"" as she puts it.  Meanwhile, two of the convent's nuns, Sister Mary Patrick (played by Kathy Najimy) and Sister Mary Robert (played by Wendy Makkena) become endeared with Sister Mary Clarence.Mother Superior finally decides to have Sister Mary Clarence join the convent's inharmonic choir, which has been under the tutelage of Sister Mary Lazurus, who was played by Mary Wickes.  This wasn't the first time that Mary Wickes portrayed a nun: she also portrayed Sister Clarissa in the films ""The Trouble with Angels"" in 1966 and its sequel ""Where Angels Go Trouble Follows"" in 1968.Will Delores find a way to survive life in the convent and bring harmony to the choir? Will Mother Superior be able to keep her sanity in tact?  Will Vince find where Delores is hiding?  To answer these questions, sit back, watch this film and be prepared to laugh!The film's rendering on DVD and sound quality are both very good.  The DVD includes a few extras: the film's trailor and two music videos that were released with the film.",5,One of the Best Comedies of the Early 1990's!,1029369600,"08 15, 2002",2002,2869,"['Sister', 'Act', 'one', 'funniest', 'best', 'made', 'films', 'early', '1990', 'Starring', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Delores', 'Van', 'Cartier', 'lounge', 'singer', 'working', 'Reno', 'Nevada', 'casino', 'film', 'flashback', 'showing', 'young', 'irreverent', 'Delores', 'Catholic', 'parochial', 'school', 'being', 'reprimanded', 'nun', 'giving', 'names', 'Beatles', 'names', 'apostles', 'nun', 'Delores', 'wo', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'poor', 'attitude.Returning', 'present', 'see', 'hapless', 'Delores', 'two', 'back-up', 'singers', 'performing', 'mostly', 'empty', 'audience', 'Reno', 'casino', 'Unhappy', 'career', 'married', 'boyfriend', 'Vince', 'LaRocca', 'played', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'decides', 'leave', 'Vince', 'giving', 'mink', 'coat', 'When', 'discovers', 'coat', 'actually', 'wife', 'Vince', 'office', 'where', 'unwittingly', 'Vince', 'shoot', 'one', 'employees', 'Sadly', 'Delores', 'unfortunate', 'appearance', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'Vince', 'orders', 'henchmen', 'get', 'Delores', 'bolts', 'Vince', 'office', 'casino', 'where', 'escape', 'flees', 'police.Now', 'knowing', 'exboyfriend', 'Vince', 'gangster', 'police', 'lieutenant', 'Eddie', 'Souther', 'played', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'must', 'enter', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'be', 'safe', 'can', 'testify', 'Vince', 'Eddie', 'Delores', 'San', 'Francisco', 'can', 'assume', 'new', 'identity', 'nun', 'convent.After', 'Eddie', 'very', 'unhappy', 'Delores', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'horror', 'being', 'nun', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'not', 'thrilled', 'situation', 'either', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watching', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'attempts', 'find', 'suitable', 'place', 'Delores', 'now', 'known', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Clarence', 'convent', 'Delores', 'disgust', 'looking', 'penguin', 'Meanwhile', 'two', 'convent', 'nuns', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Patrick', 'played', 'Kathy', 'Najimy', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Robert', 'played', 'Wendy', 'Makkena', 'become', 'endeared', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Clarence.Mother', 'Superior', 'finally', 'have', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Clarence', 'join', 'convent', 'inharmonic', 'choir', 'been', 'tutelage', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Lazurus', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'portrayed', 'nun', 'also', 'portrayed', 'Sister', 'Clarissa', 'films', 'Trouble', 'Angels', '1966', 'sequel', 'Where', 'Angels', 'Go', 'Trouble', 'Follows', '1968.Will', 'Delores', 'find', 'way', 'survive', 'life', 'convent', 'bring', 'harmony', 'choir', 'Will', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'sanity', 'tact', 'Will', 'Vince', 'find', 'where', 'Delores', 'hiding', 'answer', 'questions', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'film', 'be', 'prepared', 'laugh', 'film', 'rendering', 'DVD', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'film', 'trailor', 'two', 'music', 'videos', 'were', 'released', 'film']",N/A

She just saw her married lover, Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel), a mob boss, kill a man and is in fear for her life.  Deloris didn't want to cooperate with the police, but she wanted to live.  However, after finding out where the police were planning on stashing her, Deloris wished that she was dead.  How on earth was she supposed to pass herself off as a nun in a convent?  Still, Deloris was determined to give it her best shot and became Sister Mary Clarence.Deloris/Sister Mary Clarence hadn't been in the convent for a day before she was already causing problems and being called before Mother Superior (Maggie Smith).  Mother Superior didn't know what to do with Sister Mary Clarence, but the perfect solution presented itself when she saw how Sister Mary Clarence reacted to the atrocious choir performance on Sunday.  She promptly informed Sister Mary Clarence that she would be in charge of the choir and felt that that would keep her out of mischief.  However, before too long, Sister Mary Clarence had the whole choir rocking and rolling as she took traditional religious songs and rocked them up and rock songs and made them religious.  Unfortunately, Mary Clarence's many good works could not go unnoticed for long and she soon found the mob hot on her trail...Sister Act is a funny, entertaining movie that just makes you laugh.  The role of Deloris/Sister Mary Clarence was tailor made for Whoopi Goldberg and you can just tell that she is having a wonderful time.  The supporting cast, led by Maggie Smith (Mother Superior), Kathy Najimy (Sister Mary Patrick), Wendy Makkena (Sister Mary Robert) and Mary Wickes (Sister Mary Lazarus) was also superb and each actress brought her own unique charm into her role.

Apart from a few comic roles such as her richly deserved Oscar winning performance in ""Ghost"", she generally has appeared in films on the whole unworthy of her talents. The wonderful ""Sister Act"", casting Whoopi as a second rate Reno lounge singer hiding out dressed as a nun in a convent from her mobster boyfriend was happily one of the few times where the film role matched Ms. Goldberg's formidable talents. It is without a doubt one of my favourite comedies of recent decades and with its wonderful supporting cast offers a rare opportunity from this period for a large group of women to shine at once in a modern film. The combination of nuns, mobsters, great music and some side splitting humour is a combination made in heaven, to excuse the pun, and Whoopi makes the most of the situation.

321368,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6302581907,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","""Sister Act,""(1992), a big hit in its time for Disney's Touchstone Studio, is now 25 years old, and surely worth a closer look.  Its plot -- script by Joseph Howard--is, of course, lighter than air, concerning one Deloris Van Cartier, second rate Reno lounge singer (Whoopi Goldberg), who is unlucky enough to catch her married, mobbed-up boyfriend Vince La Rocca (Harvey Keitel), committing an execution-style murder.  If she wishes to live to testify against him, she's got to go on the run, and she does -- to a failing, out-of-touch San Francisco convent run by Dame Maggie Smith as its Mother Superior.  The first thing to say is the script's not only funny, it's also witty -- particularly in the battles of wits between Goldberg's character, rechristened Sister Mary Clarence for convent purposes, and Maggie Smith's Mother Superior.  And the wit has held up.  The second thing to say is the movie's celebrated Motown musical interludes have held up even better, and that's no accident.To begin with, the movie was produced for Disney by New York-born Scott Rudin, who has a sure hand with a light film.  You could easily think the lead part was written for Goldberg, as it fits her like a glove, but in fact, it wasn't.  It was written for Bette Midler, then the studio's favorite musical/comedy star: the New York-born Goldberg just made it hers.  Furthermore, Keitel is frequently accused of a lazy performance in this movie: but when the Brooklyn-born actor gets a chance to sink his teeth into a line like ""bupkis--"" that's Brooklynite/Yiddish for ""nothing"" to you, he delivers it with gusto.  And the picture introduced the winning Kathy Najimi, as Sister Mary Patrick, to the audience.But Disney's greatest luck, in regard to this film, has to be the trio of talented men, all born in the greater New York area, who made the musical interludes as infectious as they are.  Its director, Emile Ardolino, born in 1943 in Maspeth, Queens, unfortunately passed from us, in 1993, in Bel Air, of AIDS.  But it was well-known that he could do magic with musicals.  He won an Oscar in 1984 for a documentary, ""He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'.""  And he's further credited with ""Dirty Dancin',"" and ""Gypsy,"" two multiple award-winning musicals that also haven't lost their appeal.  To arrange the music, the studio kept the musical director of Bette Midler's stage shows, the New Jersey-born Marc Shaiman.  We now know that he, too, is extraordinarily talented musically: he's recently written ""Hairspray,"" that's won Grammy, Tony, and Emmy Awards, and is also more than likely to pick up an Oscar or two this year.  Finally, the musical scenes were choreographed by Lester Wilson, an experienced man with a Motown connection: among his other triumphs,  he choreographed ""Saturday Night Fever.""  You just gotta say that these guys couldn't put a foot wrong, musically-speaking, and it shows -- will continue to show-- on the screen.",5,Lasting Fun,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,2933,"['Sister', 'Act', '1992', 'big', 'hit', 'time', 'Disney', 'Touchstone', 'Studio', 'now', '25', 'years', 'old', 'surely', 'closer', 'look', 'plot', 'script', 'Joseph', 'Howard', 'course', 'lighter', 'air', 'concerning', 'one', 'Deloris', 'Van', 'Cartier', 'second', 'rate', 'Reno', 'lounge', 'singer', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'who', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'catch', 'married', 'mobbed-up', 'boyfriend', 'Vince', 'La', 'Rocca', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'committing', 'execution-style', 'murder', 'live', 'testify', 'got', 'go', 'run', 'failing', 'out-of-touch', 'San', 'Francisco', 'convent', 'run', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'first', 'thing', 'say', 'script', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'also', 'witty', 'particularly', 'battles', 'wits', 'Goldberg', 'character', 'rechristened', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Clarence', 'convent', 'purposes', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'wit', 'held', 'up', 'second', 'thing', 'say', 'movie', 'celebrated', 'Motown', 'musical', 'interludes', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'even', 'better', 'accident.To', 'begin', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'Disney', 'New', 'York-born', 'Scott', 'Rudin', 'who', 'sure', 'hand', 'light', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'think', 'lead', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'Goldberg', 'glove', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'written', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'then', 'studio', 'favorite', 'musical/comedy', 'star', 'New', 'York-born', 'Goldberg', 'just', 'made', 'Furthermore', 'Keitel', 'frequently', 'accused', 'lazy', 'performance', 'movie', 'when', 'Brooklyn-born', 'actor', 'chance', 'sink', 'teeth', 'line', 'bupkis', 'Brooklynite/Yiddish', 'nothing', 'gusto', 'picture', 'introduced', 'winning', 'Kathy', 'Najimi', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Patrick', 'audience.But', 'Disney', 'greatest', 'luck', 'regard', 'film', 'be', 'trio', 'talented', 'men', 'born', 'greater', 'New', 'York', 'area', 'who', 'made', 'musical', 'interludes', 'as', 'infectious', 'are', 'director', 'Emile', 'Ardolino', 'born', '1943', 'Maspeth', 'Queens', 'unfortunately', 'passed', '1993', 'Bel', 'Air', 'AIDS', 'was', 'well-known', 'could', 'do', 'magic', 'musicals', 'won', 'Oscar', '1984', 'documentary', 'Feel', 'Dancin', 'further', 'credited', 'Dirty', 'Dancin', 'Gypsy', 'two', 'multiple', 'award-winning', 'musicals', 'also', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'appeal', 'arrange', 'music', 'studio', 'kept', 'musical', 'director', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'stage', 'shows', 'New', 'Jersey-born', 'Marc', 'Shaiman', 'now', 'know', 'too', 'extraordinarily', 'talented', 'musically', 'recently', 'written', 'Hairspray', 'won', 'Grammy', 'Tony', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'also', 'more', 'likely', 'pick', 'up', 'Oscar', 'two', 'year', 'Finally', 'musical', 'scenes', 'were', 'choreographed', 'Lester', 'Wilson', 'experienced', 'man', 'Motown', 'connection', 'other', 'triumphs', 'choreographed', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'just', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'guys', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'foot', 'wrong', 'musically-speaking', 'will', 'continue', 'show', 'screen']",N/A
321369,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,6302581907,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[3, 29]","This past November, I was in Reno, Nevada.  Mrs. Van Owen, the shuttle driver who picked me up at the airport (women are always picking me up) pointed out the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral as she was pulling into my hotel's parking lot, and she said, ""That's the church they used in the movie SISTER ACT.""  Had it been ANY other church, I would have thought, Great, now how much do the video poker machines pay out on four deuces here?  But it just so happens that when I was in Reno on August 12, 2001, Jesus sent me to the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral  (although I'm not Catholic) where I was the only White person to be found in the pews, and where I observed a Catholic mass delivered entirely in Spanish.  (The only Spanish I know is ""Si"", ""No"", and some words that Ricky Garcia called me in junior high school.)  I kept thinking, Nice music, Lord, but why did You send me here?  It wasn't until the mass ended and I exited the church, that He revealed His purpose:  On the steps of that very cathedral, Jesus, with a ""miraclette"", answered an important and troubling question that I'd been praying about for an entire month.  (That's a story for another review.)  So when my shuttle driver mentioned that particular church being used in the movie SISTER ACT, I determined to rent the 1992, WHOOPI GOLDBERG vehicle upon my return to Airheadzona.  I'm back and I did.Now, I grew tired of Goldberg's sassy, mononote thing a long time ago (""You want me to do WHAT?!  Uh-uh.  You got the WRONG woman, fool!""), so I wasn't expecting much, and my expectations were met but not exceeded.  I knew this thing was going to be nun too good when I saw Harvey Keitel mentioned in the opening credits.  (I have a rule of thumb: ""Avoid EVERYTHING with Harvey Keitel in it.""  But since there's an exception to almost every rule, I'll add, ""except maybe TAXI DRIVER."")SISTER ACT's bad habits started immediately:  It opens with a scene at ""Saint Anne's Academy in 1968"" (with the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral playing the part of Saint Anne's Academy in one brief shot.  Boo! I rented THIS movie for THAT?)  Here we find Deloris Van Cartier (later played by Goldberg) as a youngster being asked by a nun to name the apostles.  She gives a ""Fabulous"" (but incorrect) answer.  Cut to Van Cartier many years later performing as the leader in a girl group retro act at a Reno lounge, and showing great unhappiness at being ignored by the nearby boozers and gamblers.  Is it really unusual for free entertainment on a casino floor to go scarcely noticed? Would this REALLY upset a longtime lounge singer?  Wouldn't she be used to the lack of attention while on stage by now?  It would be the norm; just another day, just another paycheck.  We've got nonsense right out of the chute, I thought.The two-bit Reno nightclub singer, Van Cartier, accidentally witnesses her boyfriend, Vince LaRocca, orchestrate a young man's murder.  (HARVEY KEITEL plays the evidently sight-challenged mobster.  He couldn't find a more attractive two-bit nightclub singer in all of Reno?  Please!)  Now Van Cartier is (a soon-to-be nun) on the run.Until LaRocca's murder charge comes up for trial, Lieutenant Eddie Souther (BILL NUNN, who must have gotten the part based only on his last name) places Van Cartier in a convent under the Witness Protection Program.  The hulking Nunn is horribly miscast and gives a downright embarrassing performance as a lawman.  Trying to pass this guy off as a street-hardened, high-ranking law enforcement officer is like trying to pass off Garfield the cat as a police dog!  Nunn plays most scenes with this goofy ""oh-you-kid"" grin.  (Sit down Lieutentant before you hurt yourself!)Meanwhile, gangster LaRocca - awaiting his murder trial, yet incredibly free to roam the city (What? Did he have a ""Get Out Of Jail"" card tucked into his ""violin case""?) - and his two unintimidating, geriatric hitmen, are trying to locate Van Cartier to enunciate with gunfire their displeasure at her willingness to testify.In the convent, Van Cartier's life is adhering to the typical Hollywood formula - ""the outcast finds her niche and makes good"" paint-by-numbers kit.  You know the gig!  And we're treated to all the usual: Tough and/or cool street people in ridiculously exaggerated ""tough and/or cool street people"" costumes (how about just T-shirts and jeans, folks?  You know, like REAL people on the street wear?); the gag where three guys simultaneously rush through a small opening and momentarily get stuck a la The Three Stooges (Har!-Har!-Har!); and of course, the obligatory and ubiquitous bit where the guys take it in the ""family jewels"" while the heroine makes good her escape.  (The nutcracker shtick ceased to be fresh and funny about 1976, but they're still feeding it to us regularly because, you know, there's little genuine writing talent in Tinsel Town.  Or haven't you noticed?)  There are about 101 additional problems with this act, Sisters and Brothers, but there's no point in listing them all; it's not like you're going to pay attention to anything I say anyway.  (The nuns fly to Reno to rescue Van Cartier because... uhm... there was no way to telephone Reno Law Enforcement?  That's just a guess on my part.  ""Ain't nun of ya in the habit of keeping any spare change around, pray tell?"")I did enjoy the clever musical arrangements, and Goldberg's prayer before supper at the convent was appropriately inappropriate.  But I loved Mary Wickes in the minor role of Sister Mary Lazarus, the ancient but tough-as-General MacArthur nun.  I thought she had the best lines in the movie. (""I liked my convent in Vancouver, out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern like some of these newfangled convents.  We didn't have electricity - cold water, bare feet - THOSE were nuns!...it was hell on earth; I loved it!  This place is a Hilton."")  You go, Sister!  Discipline those Pillsbury Dough Boy-soft troops!Still, I can think of better uses for my time than watching SISTER ACT.  (Sleeping, eating, reading, and writing a negative review of SISTER ACT all come immediately to mind.)  Hey, I love a fun, stupid comedy (e.g., The Pink Panther Strikes Again or Monty Python And The Holy Grail), but because it actually asks us to accept as plausible its preposterous scenario, SISTER ACT is dumber than a lobotomized moron with paralyzed vocal cords.  Making it, of course, the ideal movie for postliterate America.  Whoopi!(I hear what you're thinking: Why is he always knocking America?  But I'm not!  I'm always criticizing America, and there's a difference: 2 more syllables and 3 more letters!)",2,NUN TOO GOOD,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,6606,"['past', 'November', 'was', 'Reno', 'Nevada',
