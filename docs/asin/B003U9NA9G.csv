1363190,A3VA7MACQJZPBT,B003U9NA9G,"Kelly Blackwell - Here's My Take On It ""Kelly""","[0, 0]","Johnny is a story about damage and about purpose.  Even the lives that are here for just a short time have a purpose set by God. Johnny has an aggressive form of leukemia.  If there was ever a prognosis that wasn't good, it is Johnny's.  Although Johnny is fully aware of his situation, He has an outlook on life that is amazing.  He memorizes words of scripture, holds onto and shares God's promises, and knows that no matter what God has a purpose for his life.  He is completely open to God's will.  He has complete faith in God which he shares openly and bravely.Dr. Carter and his family take him in.  His daughter who has been suffering from a mom who is mentally and emotionally absent from her and her father's life is excited about having Johnny in her home.  He is funny and kind.  She opens up her home and heart to him and God right away.  Dr. Carter has opened his heart and listens to Johnny.  He enjoys the child's company a great deal and gains a new insight.  Sadly his wife Julia is not ready for Johnny to live with them.  She deals with the decision her husband has made, but her heart is so torn up.  There is no room in her life for this boy when her heart is still torn to shreds over the loss of her son.  She has no interest in attaching to another child especially when that child is knocking at death's door.Things that stood out to me:Setting - I cannot mention this film without saying how much I enjoyed the setting.  I do not know where it was filmed, but I was ready to move there.  Combine green grass and an ocean with some pretty blue skies...take me away.Characters -I loved that the characters were flawed but real.  Certainly you aren't going to run into Johnny every day, but there are people just like him everywhere.  People who are facing deep trials but shining God's love to others.  Now some, like Johnny, may have an illness that is obvious to the eye, but others have circumstances that you may never know of, but they love with all they have rather than let the pain get them down.  They know that  God has a purpose for their lives.I liked that there was realism in the family dynamic.  Mom was really struggling (though initially the acting seemed over the top).  Her husband brings this sweet kid home, and she is just wigged out.  She is in real pain over her loss.  Pain that she is told she needs to move on from.  That is not an easy thing to do.  It was realistic that not everyone is just ready to paint rainbows and find happy ever after, because life is not always happy ever after and many of us also have a pain that we are still clinging to.  This doesn't mean we should be clinging to our pain, but it does happen.Actors -Great job with all.  Loved the child actors.  They were incredible.  Loved seeing Lee Majors in a Christian film too.Final thought -Johnny is a sweet story about forgiveness of self and others.  It is sometimes breezy and easy but it also has very serious moments.  Will it tug at your heart?  Yes.  Will it inspire you?  Absolutely.  I did say it is family friendly, but I would definitely have a family viewing starting at about age 8 or 9 with the kiddos.",4,Bittersweet With Great Message,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,3143,"['Johnny', 'story', 'damage', 'purpose', 'Even', 'lives', 'are', 'here', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'have', 'purpose', 'set', 'God', 'Johnny', 'aggressive', 'form', 'leukemia', 'was', 'ever', 'prognosis', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'Johnny', 'Johnny', 'fully', 'aware', 'situation', 'outlook', 'life', 'amazing', 'words', 'scripture', 'shares', 'God', 'promises', 'matter', 'what', 'God', 'purpose', 'life', 'completely', 'open', 'God', 'will', 'complete', 'faith', 'God', 'shares', 'openly', 'bravely.Dr', 'Carter', 'family', 'take', 'daughter', 'who', 'been', 'suffering', 'mom', 'who', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'absent', 'father', 'life', 'excited', 'having', 'Johnny', 'home', 'funny', 'kind', 'up', 'home', 'heart', 'God', 'right', 'away', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'opened', 'heart', 'Johnny', 'child', 'company', 'great', 'deal', 'gains', 'new', 'insight', 'Sadly', 'wife', 'Julia', 'not', 'ready', 'Johnny', 'live', 'decision', 'husband', 'made', 'heart', 'so', 'torn', 'up', 'room', 'life', 'boy', 'when', 'heart', 'still', 'torn', 'shreds', 'loss', 'son', 'interest', 'attaching', 'child', 'especially', 'when', 'child', 'knocking', 'death', 'door.Things', 'stood', 'out', 'Setting', 'can', 'not', 'mention', 'film', 'saying', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'setting', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'ready', 'move', 'there', 'Combine', 'green', 'grass', 'ocean', 'pretty', 'blue', 'skies', 'take', 'away.Characters', '-I', 'loved', 'characters', 'were', 'flawed', 'real', 'Certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'run', 'Johnny', 'day', 'are', 'people', 'just', 'everywhere', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'facing', 'deep', 'trials', 'shining', 'God', 'love', 'others', 'Now', 'Johnny', 'may', 'have', 'illness', 'obvious', 'eye', 'others', 'have', 'circumstances', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'love', 'have', 'rather', 'let', 'pain', 'get', 'down', 'know', 'God', 'purpose', 'lives.I', 'liked', 'was', 'realism', 'family', 'dynamic', 'Mom', 'was', 'really', 'struggling', 'initially', 'acting', 'seemed', 'top', 'husband', 'sweet', 'kid', 'home', 'just', 'wigged', 'out', 'real', 'pain', 'loss', 'Pain', 'told', 'move', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'was', 'realistic', 'not', 'everyone', 'just', 'ready', 'paint', 'rainbows', 'find', 'happy', 'ever', 'life', 'not', 'always', 'happy', 'ever', 'many', 'also', 'have', 'pain', 'are', 'still', 'clinging', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'be', 'clinging', 'pain', 'happen.Actors', '-Great', 'job', 'Loved', 'child', 'actors', 'were', 'incredible', 'Loved', 'seeing', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Christian', 'film', 'too.Final', 'thought', '-Johnny', 'sweet', 'story', 'forgiveness', 'self', 'others', 'sometimes', 'breezy', 'easy', 'also', 'very', 'serious', 'moments', 'Will', 'tug', 'heart', 'Yes', 'Will', 'inspire', 'Absolutely', 'did', 'say', 'family', 'friendly', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'family', 'viewing', 'starting', 'about', 'age', '8', '9', 'kiddos']",N/A
