As an artist, I have been acquainted with Frank's work for the past 30-35 years. I won't deny his influence on some of my work. Neither would most other contemporary artists who are honest with themselves. His body of work is well reprsented here and will include many paintings people who are not already aware of him will recognize.  That said, this film also embraces how the spirit of true genius can refuse to succumb to the limits that are sometimes imposed on we humans by the nature of our physical existence. Frank suffered several strokes (which would be enough to sideline most people) and one of them debilitated his primary painting hand so he switched to his left hand with little noticeable difference in his work. Frank was also a tremendous athlete and, more than likely, would have impacted the realm of professional sports to the same degree as his art, had he made that choice. This film illustrates how belief in one's self and never losing your zest for life can result in superior achievement.",5,A Film Even Those With No Artistic Bent Can Appreciate,1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,1064,"['agree', 'wholeheartedly', 'first', 'reviewer', 'artist', 'have', 'been', 'acquainted', 'Frank', 'work', 'past', '30-35', 'years', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'influence', 'work', 'would', 'most', 'other', 'contemporary', 'artists', 'who', 'are', 'honest', 'body', 'work', 'well', 'reprsented', 'here', 'will', 'include', 'many', 'paintings', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'already', 'aware', 'will', 'recognize', 'said', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'spirit', 'true', 'genius', 'can', 'refuse', 'succumb', 'limits', 'are', 'sometimes', 'imposed', 'humans', 'nature', 'physical', 'existence', 'Frank', 'suffered', 'several', 'strokes', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'sideline', 'most', 'people', 'one', 'debilitated', 'primary', 'painting', 'hand', 'so', 'switched', 'left', 'hand', 'little', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'work', 'Frank', 'was', 'also', 'tremendous', 'athlete', 'more', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'impacted', 'realm', 'professional', 'sports', 'same', 'degree', 'art', 'had', 'made', 'choice', 'film', 'how', 'belief', 'one', 'self', 'never', 'losing', 'zest', 'life', 'can', 'result', 'superior', 'achievement']",Frazetta - Painting with Fire

859552,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00064ALNG,Kevin Killian,"[1, 1]","I enjoyed this insider's look into Frank Frazetta's museum, career, and friends.  He must have been a great guy to have attracted so many caring friends.But I don't believe that he is the most influential artist of the last 50 years.  No way, even if after seeing this documentary I now believe he had enormous influence in the way bad movies look.John Milius is here to say that, even though everyone in Hollywood wanted their movies to look like living Franzettas, only Conan pulled that off--sort of a slap in the face of Ralph Bakshi, who also swans around bragging that at least FIRE AND ICE had direct involvement from the man himself.  It's interesting watching the way the editor (and director) pits Bakshi against Milius, but in the unscripted portions of the show it seems that Franzetta really cares for Bakshi as a man, whereas Milius seems like just another crazed fan.I wonder what the film would have been like if it had been released after Franzetta's death.  If I have one problem with it, it's too hagiographic.  It's crazy, and counterproductive, to imply that not only is Franzetta a great artist, but he is also a great ""sportsman,"" golfer, photographer, husband, etc.  The movie comes in chapters, with titles, titles perhaps half-humorously echoing ""Conan the Barbarian,"" but instead it's ""Franzetta the Sportsman,"" and so forth.  Sorry, it's just a little over the top for me!  I know purists will retort that Franzetta's essence is ""over the top"" and that's why he's the king of Sword and Sorcery, but those countless vanity shots of his John Rechy/Sly Stallone body when young, claim a status for him as matinee idol that just seems silly.  And since his tragic stroke, he looks exactly like my late comedy favorite Rodney Dangerfield, yet no one comments on this!  Maybe they're afraid to offend him.  I wish there was some deeper perspective on him than just this tale of genius unleashed, but that's all there is.  That's okay though, because what we have here is great and it is heartwarming--the triumphant yet melancholy underscore sees to that--not to mention aged Rodney Dangerfield style Frank Franzetta playing the Moonlight Sonata and Fur Elise in the twilight of his years.  And Bo Derek gives the movie some needed 70sism; it's always great to see her, especially in a non-acting role, so you don't have to eat your cake to have it too!",4,Twilight of the Gods,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,2375,"['enjoyed', 'insider', 'look', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'museum', 'career', 'friends', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'guy', 'have', 'attracted', 'so', 'many', 'caring', 'friends.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'most', 'influential', 'artist', 'last', '50', 'years', 'way', 'even', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'now', 'believe', 'had', 'enormous', 'influence', 'way', 'bad', 'movies', 'look.John', 'Milius', 'here', 'say', 'even', 'everyone', 'Hollywood', 'wanted', 'movies', 'look', 'living', 'Franzettas', 'only', 'Conan', 'pulled', 'off', 'sort', 'slap', 'face', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'who', 'also', 'around', 'bragging', 'least', 'FIRE', 'AND', 'ICE', 'had', 'direct', 'involvement', 'man', 'interesting', 'watching', 'way', 'editor', 'director', 'Bakshi', 'Milius', 'unscripted', 'portions', 'show', 'Franzetta', 'really', 'Bakshi', 'man', 'whereas', 'Milius', 'just', 'crazed', 'fan.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'Franzetta', 'death', 'have', 'one', 'problem', 'too', 'hagiographic', 'crazy', 'counterproductive', 'imply', 'not', 'only', 'Franzetta', 'great', 'artist', 'also', 'great', 'sportsman', 'golfer', 'photographer', 'husband', 'etc', 'movie', 'chapters', 'titles', 'titles', 'perhaps', 'half-humorously', 'echoing', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'instead', 'Franzetta', 'Sportsman', 'so', 'forth', 'Sorry', 'just', 'little', 'top', 'know', 'purists', 'will', 'retort', 'Franzetta', 'essence', 'top', 'why', 'king', 'Sword', 'Sorcery', 'countless', 'vanity', 'shots', 'John', 'Rechy/Sly', 'Stallone', 'body', 'when', 'young', 'claim', 'status', 'matinee', 'idol', 'just', 'silly', 'tragic', 'stroke', 'exactly', 'like', 'late', 'comedy', 'favorite', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'yet', 'one', 'comments', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'offend', 'wish', 'was', 'deeper', 'perspective', 'just', 'tale', 'genius', 'unleashed', 'okay', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'great', 'heartwarming', 'triumphant', 'melancholy', 'underscore', 'sees', 'not', 'mention', 'aged', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'style', 'Frank', 'Franzetta', 'playing', 'Moonlight', 'Sonata', 'Fur', 'Elise', 'twilight', 'years', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'movie', 'needed', '70sism', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'especially', 'non-acting', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'eat', 'cake', 'have', 'too']",Frazetta - Painting with Fire

859554,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00064ALNG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[20, 20]","I am pretty sure that the first time I saw a Frank Frazetta cover it would have been a copy of ""Eerie"" or ""Creepy"" at the PX.  The first covers I owned of paperbacks with Frazetta art would have been the Edgar Rice Burroughs paper backs put out by Ace, which is when I would have learned Frazetta's name and start to automatically associate it with his distinctive artwork of half-naked warriors and sensual women in exotic settings, along with his signature (the latter being as iconic a signature for representing an artist's style as you will ever come across).  Then, of course, there are all the Lancer paperback reprints of Conan the Barbarian, which certainly comprises his most famous body of work.  As for what was the first Frazetta poster I owned, that is easy: ""The Frost Giant's Daughter"" (a.k.a. the cover of ""Conan the Cimmerian"").""Frazetta: Painting with Fire"" is a 2003 documentary put together by Lance Laspina that is clearly a labor of love.  Laspina combines conversations with the artist himself with home movies and an impressive collection of talking heads that include family members, others artists (from Neal Adams to Berni Wrightson), and fans (including John Milius and Bo Derek).  We also get to see the Frazetta Museum on his property in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania as Frank looks at his work and offers his remembrances.  The documentary on Disc 1 runs two-hours and has an audio commentary track by Laspina and producer Jeremy J. DiFiore.  Primarily what we have here is a combination biography and testimonial to the artist.  There are a few attempts to make an appropriate critical appreciate for this technique, but mostly ""Frazetta"" deals with anecdotes and declarations attesting to his importance in the realm of art depicting fantasy, science fiction, and adventure.On Disc 2 we get to watch Frank draw a mirror image of the lion from his ""Egyptian Egypt"" painting left-handed (he has had to switch drawing hands because of a series of strokes), while talking periodically about his artistic process on August 24, 2000.  Then there is a lengthy montage of photographs from the life of the artist, which must include pretty much every photo of Frank the Frazetta family owns, set to music from the documentary (this makes for interesting contrasts between the overly dramatic music playing over shots of Frank with his kids at the beach, which then segues to Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"" playing while Frank paints Conan, shoots golf, and poses with the likes of George Lucas, Clint Eastwood and Bo Derek).  We also have Home Movies of Frank, Elle, the family, and the Frazetta Children, accompanied by a radio interview with Frank conducted in 1994.  A section is devoted to Ralph Bakshi's ""Fire and Ice,"" which includes ""Evil Ice Lord Memoir,"" consisting of actor Sean Hannon's notes on the shooting of the production, and a gallery of German lobby cards for the animated film.  Then there are the deleted scenes, outtakes and stories from the documentary, but they come across as minor concerns compared to just watching Frazetta's artwork go by on your television screen.These are multiple gallery tours of rare art on the bonus disc, which are not restricted to a simple series of shots of each work, but often include close ups of key details, for which I am appreciative.  Even though these tours of prelims, oils, sculptures, comics and the rest are done as slide shows you can use the chapter stops to move through them at your own pace, which is an unexpectedly nice touch.  Besides, seeing the rough sketches that Frazetta did for some of your favorite paintings or pages of some of his comic book art from long again is certainly a treat.  A gallery of artwork by Frazetta's peers allows you to judge who succeeds best in the imitations is the sincerest form of flattery department (my votes are for Alex Horley, Sam Wood, and Todd Lockwood).  Artist Bios are provided by Brom, Neal Adams, and the rest of the talking heads from the documentary as well.  This is a 2-DVD set where either DVD is probably enough to make a Frazetta fan deliriously happy.",5,A testament to the power of the art of Frank Frazetta,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,4108,"['am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'cover', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'copy', 'Eerie', 'Creepy', 'PX', 'first', 'covers', 'owned', 'paperbacks', 'Frazetta', 'art', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'paper', 'backs', 'put', 'out', 'Ace', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'Frazetta', 'name', 'start', 'automatically', 'associate', 'distinctive', 'artwork', 'half-naked', 'warriors', 'sensual', 'women', 'exotic', 'settings', 'signature', 'latter', 'being', 'iconic', 'signature', 'representing', 'artist', 'style', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'Then', 'course', 'are', 'Lancer', 'paperback', 'reprints', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'certainly', 'most', 'famous', 'body', 'work', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'Frazetta', 'poster', 'owned', 'easy', 'Frost', 'Giant', 'Daughter', 'a.k.a', 'cover', 'Conan', 'Cimmerian', 'Frazetta', 'Painting', 'Fire', '2003', 'documentary', 'put', 'together', 'Lance', 'Laspina', 'clearly', 'labor', 'love', 'Laspina', 'combines', 'conversations', 'artist', 'home', 'movies', 'impressive', 'collection', 'talking', 'heads', 'include', 'family', 'members', 'others', 'artists', 'Neal', 'Adams', 'Berni', 'Wrightson', 'fans', 'including', 'John', 'Milius', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Frazetta', 'Museum', 'property', 'East', 'Stroudsburg', 'Pennsylvania', 'Frank', 'work', 'remembrances', 'documentary', 'Disc', '1', 'two-hours', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'Laspina', 'producer', 'Jeremy', 'J.', 'DiFiore', 'Primarily', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'combination', 'biography', 'testimonial', 'artist', 'are', 'few', 'attempts', 'make', 'appropriate', 'critical', 'appreciate', 'technique', 'mostly', 'Frazetta', 'deals', 'anecdotes', 'declarations', 'attesting', 'importance', 'realm', 'art', 'depicting', 'fantasy', 'science', 'fiction', 'adventure.On', 'Disc', '2', 'get', 'watch', 'Frank', 'draw', 'mirror', 'image', 'lion', 'Egyptian', 'Egypt', 'painting', 'left-handed', 'had', 'switch', 'drawing', 'hands', 'series', 'strokes', 'talking', 'periodically', 'artistic', 'process', 'August', '24', '2000', 'Then', 'lengthy', 'montage', 'photographs', 'life', 'artist', 'must', 'include', 'pretty', 'much', 'photo', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'family', 'set', 'music', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'contrasts', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'music', 'playing', 'shots', 'Frank', 'kids', 'beach', 'then', 'Beethoven', 'Moonlight', 'Sonata', 'playing', 'Frank', 'paints', 'Conan', 'shoots', 'golf', 'likes', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'also', 'have', 'Home', 'Movies', 'Frank', 'Elle', 'family', 'Frazetta', 'Children', 'accompanied', 'radio', 'interview', 'Frank', 'conducted', '1994', 'section', 'devoted', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'Evil', 'Ice', 'Lord', 'Memoir', 'consisting', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Hannon', 'notes', 'shooting', 'production', 'gallery', 'German', 'lobby', 'cards', 'animated', 'film', 'Then', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'stories', 'documentary', 'come', 'minor', 'concerns', 'compared', 'just', 'watching', 'Frazetta', 'artwork', 'go', 'television', 'screen.These', 'are', 'multiple', 'gallery', 'tours', 'rare', 'art', 'bonus', 'disc', 'are', 'not', 'restricted', 'simple', 'series', 'shots', 'work', 'often', 'include', 'close', 'ups', 'key', 'details', 'am', 'appreciative', 'Even', 'tours', 'prelims', 'oils', 'sculptures', 'comics', 'rest', 'are', 'done', 'slide', 'can', 'use', 'chapter', 'move', 'own', 'pace', 'unexpectedly', 'nice', 'touch', 'Besides', 'seeing', 'rough', 'sketches', 'Frazetta', 'did', 'favorite', 'paintings', 'pages', 'comic', 'book', 'art', 'long', 'again', 'certainly', 'treat', 'gallery', 'artwork', 'Frazetta', 'peers', 'judge', 'who', 'best', 'imitations', 'sincerest', 'form', 'flattery', 'department', 'votes', 'are', 'Alex', 'Horley', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'Todd', 'Lockwood', 'Artist', 'Bios', 'are', 'provided', 'Brom', 'Neal', 'Adams', 'rest', 'talking', 'heads', 'documentary', 'as', 'well', '2-DVD', 'set', 'where', 'DVD', 'probably', 'enough', 'make', 'Frazetta', 'fan', 'deliriously', 'happy']",Frazetta - Painting with Fire

After you've seen it once you already know what will happen and the interest level in repeated watchings  drops considerably. The same holds true here -  hence the 3 stars.However this documentary is still worth owning if you are a Frank Frazetta fan. I discovered Frank's art in the mid 60's.  I was a fan of Creepy and Eerie Comics and also the Conan series that came out in paperback.  I never really was able to finish the novels, but I bought them (at 45 cents a pop) because I dug those covers.  Frazetta painted them all.  As I got older my interest never went away.  I bought his art books and trading cards.  But I never knew much about the artist himself.  He seemed to be a mysterious human.  Well I found out by seeing this DVD that he is a warm and loving family man. His wife (and business manager) and he have been together since they met as teens.  He also is loyal to his friends, some of whom are shown today as old men, but they played ball together as young men. Frazetta has had his ups and downs with health issues, but his art always shines.  This is a wonderful tribute to a fine gentleman, good athlete, and a great artist, and it fascinated me. If you are a Frazetta fan, then I recommend that you purchase it as well.

859556,AGJLO8GK3A1SX,B00064ALNG,R. Hussain,"[11, 12]","I recently received a present of the Ralph Bakshi animated film ""FIRE & ICE"" and was was shocked to see the documentary PAINTING WITH FIRE on Disc-2.I quickly slipped the disc into the player and pressed ""play""...Right, I'm a Frazetta nut and so I was thinking there's NO way they'll do a good documentary on the guy. Wrong! They did a good job indeed.The feature-length documentary covers Frazetta's early life and fills in the missing blanks about what he did in the years when he had to fend for himself. For an artist who is extremely private and reclusive, this film peeled back the layers of mystery and revealed the man beneath. It's a very intimate portrait and one that throws light on many aspects of his life as a sportsman and a devoted family man.The film opens with an absolutely stunning 3-D rendering of the Clayburn Moore ""Conan the Barbarian"" statue and the painting literally comes to life and moves. The facial bones twitch and the eyes of the Barbarian blaze with intense fire, the sword drips with blood and the slave girl grips onto his leg with unbridled lust conveyed in her luscious legs and flowing hair and across the sky huge vultures circle for the meat on the pile of corpses that the Barbarian stands knee deep in. Skulls lie crushed all around and the sun drips golden fire all over the landscape behind this might warrior.What a truly inspirational opening to the film.I adored the method used to illustrate and showcase the oil paintings. The colours were rich and the lighting was magnificent. It was like seeing the artworks for the first time. It's one thing seeing them in books and another thing to see them displayed on the screen in such vivid detail. And, what a lovely surprise it was to see rare sketches and variant versions of some of Frazetta's paintings in this film.Laspina's method of using ""chapters"" to sketch though Frazetta's life reminded me of a book-style presentation and it worked splendidly. This was a very effective format and allowed the viewer to focus in on the different aspects of Frazetta's varied life.It was great to see Frazetta talk and reminisce about the old days. And despite his ill-health this man is still a fighter! And did you notice that in MANY of the paintings it is Frazetta himself who is the central figure for the model? Just take a careful look at ""Conan the Adventurer"" (the Clayburn statue) and you'll realize it's none other than Frazetta himself! The lighting in the film really brought out subtle details that are missing in the books. The art had much greater shading and revealed acres of stuff that the books can never get close to due to their ""flat"" printing process and the quality of paper used.It was interesting to note that because Frazetta had such a busy life as a sportsman, he sometimes ran out of time for his commissions and was thus reduced to painting the pieces in a matter of hours. If he had run out of paper he would simply tear out a plank of wood from the floorboard and use that as a canvas. He would make a pot of coffee, put on a classical record and finish the painting in six hours or so. He'd then spend a week recovering from this intense battle between his creative juices and his physical body. His hands would literally shake with the exertion after painting these pieces. The impulse and speed of the work actually lent his finished pieces a rawness and savagery that is sorely lacking in the works of other painters such as Boris Vallejo.The film also discussed the influence that Frazetta has had on the world of film, literature and art. John Milius, Simon Bisley, Ralph Bakshi, Sylvester Stallone, George Lucas, Bernie Wrightson, Clint Eastwood, Michael Kaluta, Steven Spielberg, etc , etc, have all used Frazetta's famous style in some of their works.And to compare Frazetta to Michelangelo and Da Vinci was valid. Frzaetta is sometimes ignored by the Fine Art community because he is regarded as an ""illustrator"". Well, in that case, so were all the past greats because they also illustrated books e.g. The Holy Bible. I think there is idle snobbery levelled at Frazetta because his subject matter usually depicts Fantasy scenes. Nevertheless, Frazetta does not need to prove himself to the Art critics because this man can paint with oils, water-colours, ink, he has produced prints and worked on canvas and also delivered stunning sculptures. A man of many talents then! Just like his fellow painters from the Renaissance period.I would have preferred this film to have run for six hours but I can't complain too much since they did cover many of the bases. Even the end credits proved to be fun. Laspina left a little clip after the film closed for the fans - we see Ralph Bakshi walking away from the Frazetta museum with a huge stolen canvas stuck under his shirt!All I now need to do is see the Special Edition of this documentary which contains a second disc of supplemental material where we see Frazetta drawing a panther and the picture gallery contained on the DVD is supposed to be

It's hard to make retrospective documentaries of personalities that are popular. Too glowing and the work looks like it's catering to the subject. Too honest and the feature will not meet approval with those followers. The balancing act is well done in this feature because it lets the artist, his family and friends, and surprisingly his peers and colleagues, all, carve out the narrative that is the artist's life, past and present. My favorite parts are Frank visiting his old friends in Brooklyn.What really makes this documentary stand out is the way it balances Frank Frazetta's life with his work, his art and it's impact on both the fans, family and even the illustration community. There's little doubt that Frank Frazetta and his work have had a lasting impact on the popular arts and publishing.

Warriors, maidens and mythic creatures live out their extreme lives in masterful strokes pen and ink or oil paint dobs and dabs.  Even reissues of old ""Conan"" paperbacks become instant best sellers when his striking art is on the covers.For many in the film business, Frazetta is the single most influential artist of the last 50 years.Lance Laspina's wonderful documentary looks at the personal and professional life of Frazetta who was born in Brooklyn in 1928.This two disc set is an affectionate tribute to this amazing artist and family man.  The most moving extra is a 20 minute photo montage of his life from childhood to the present. Go to FrazettaArtGallery.com for sample of his work.What is especially astonishing about Frazetta is that he did some of his best paintings totally from memory.

This is a man to admire on many levels, and to hear others speak such praise of him on this disc will bring a tear to your eye. Talented, humble(I can't stress this enough!!!), and unrelenting, Frazetta has overcome obstacle after obstacle, never complaining, only adjusting and perfecting what is in many eyes already perfection. I am not an artist, but this documentary had me rivited; The human side to this man's story and the art he has so lovingly created is something that can be enjoyed by all, artist or not.

I became a fan of Frazetta's art like many back in the early 1970's through his astonishing Conan paperback covers and magazine covers for such magazines as Creepy and Eerie.But until this film I had never actually seen the man behind the art.  He seemed mysterious, enigmatic, which lent that much more aura to his art.  This film relates Frazetta's life from birth to present day.  Here is a guy who is a true man's man.  A sportsman in every sense of the word.  Hunter, camper, golfer, baseball, basketball...Frazetta's well chisled physique as a young man conjures images of the powerful figures he would put to canvas in years to come.We see frazetta's start as a young cartoonist and learn of his formal art training.  We see him in the days of EC comics drawing fabulous sci-fi and fantasy comic books.  We then move to the era of his fantastic oil paintings for which he is so well known for.  The Conan covers, the movie posters.Through it all well known artists like Mike Kaluta, Dave Stevens, Berni Wrightson, and many others comment on Frazetta's genius.  He is truly the man who all other artists in the fantasy and sci-fi genres bowed down to.  We see Frazetta surrounded by celebrity friends, many who are collectors of his art.Through it we see that Frank was a family man, married to the same woman for over 30 years and raising a family.  We see the effects of a stroke which forced Frazetta to have to learn how to paint and draw with his left hand.  An increidible inspiration and testament to his strong will.Whether your a Frazetta fan or not you're sure to be captivated by this man, formerly as mysterious as the mythic figures he painted.

On the one hand, it would be so simple to dismiss it as pulp garbage not worth a second look.  But, if that is true, why do the eyes keep coming back and back to his work?  I think it is for the simple reason that Frazetta had that rarest of artistic gifts - the power to provoke emotional response through his work.  Frazetta is not only one of the great artists of the 20th century popular imagination, but one of the great shapers of that imagination.  And this wonderful little documentary tells his story very well.This is not a slick production.  It is a simple narrative documentary with generous interviews with the artist and his contemporaries who are talking quite seriously about the merits of Frazetta's work and the man himself.  And I was shocked to see that Frazetta was really ""Joe Six-Pack,"" a normal, humorous guy from New York with a life anyone could recognize.  He is just one of those lucky few who had a galaxy of imagination in his mind and hands.  But, the ""humanization"" of Frazetta in no way diminishes the art of the fantastic that was his forte.  And, any complaints about how he protrays women in his art should be dispelled by his explanation of how he sees women - not as objects or ""fetish-bots,"" but beautiful and empowered.  His simple commentary allowed me to look at his work in a new way.  And I was very pleased by what I saw.It's a warm but frank documentary, as where, for example, Frazetta discussed his illnesses and accompanying resentments with candor and frustrated grace.
