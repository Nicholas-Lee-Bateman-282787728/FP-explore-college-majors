1266066,AYD5PNH0ED0JW,B002FBH83O,"Art Chick ""Art Chick""","[285, 287]","I never believed that Michael Jackson was guilty of child molestation. Not because I'm some over the top or obsessed fan who believes that an icon can do no wrong...because that's not who I am. I'm just a 42 year old woman who grew up listening to some Michael Jackson tunes once in awhile. I loved some of his songs, and I hated some of his songs. But I was never one to follow his every move, nor did I watch every music video, or try to catch his every appearance on TV. I was however always intrigued and captivated when I did see Michael on the screen or hear his music. He had a talent that commanded attention, and a passion for helping others, especially children, and I always admired him for that.So I remember standing in my living room when I caught a glimpse of Michael on TV, as he spoke out against the horrible crimes against a child for which he had been accused. Just looking at the pain in his eyes and listening to the power of his voice, I did not see a child molester. Whatever they were accusing him of, I just could not believe to be true, because I could not see one trace of guilt on that man's face, nor in his voice as he pleaded with the world not to condemn him for something he did not do.But the media sure seemed to paint a different picture of Michael Jackson, one that seemed to convict him early on. And it was so insane to me that so many people suddenly looked at him and talked about him differently, as if it was just so easy to believe he was guilty. Because after all, if a man likes children, he must be a pervert too, right? And when he agreed to settle with the accusers for a large sum of money, that seemed to make everything worse. To many people, that made him guilty.When the second case came along, it definitely didn't help Michael in his efforts to rebuild an image that had become so badly tarnished. And for many who had their reservations about his innocence before, the new charges erased any doubt. But not for me. My very first thought was, someone wants money--they saw him pay off the last family, so surely he'd pay again. Easy target. And as the trial unfolded, I watched with sadness as this once energetic and magnetic personality seemed to withdraw even further within himself, inside a cocoon of obvious pain. He was acquitted of every single charge, but he was condemned in the minds of many people and viewed as some freakish form of evil (his obsession with plastic surgery only seemed to add fuel to this fire). And you could tell when it was all over that Michael Jackson had become a different person, a shell of his former vibrant self. I can only imagine how betrayed he felt by his accusers, and by those who would believe the most vile of lies about him. No wonder he left the country!When I found this DVD last week, I ordered it right away and couldn't wait to watch it, and it definitely confirmed to me what I have believed this entire time: MICHAEL JACKSON WAS INNOCENT! As was noted in the DVD, if he was guilty of anything, it was only bad judgment. But he sure paid a high price for that, in so many ways.I only wish that this video had aired on TV long ago, to help combat all the lies and negativity that followed MJ even long after the acquittal. More people need to see this DVD. More people need to know the truth--that Michael Jackson was a talented, compassionate, and caring human being, who had flaws just like the rest of us. But he was not a child molester; rather, he was a victim of lies and outright extortion, and of the tabloid journalism that would follow him until he took his very last breath.I can't help but wonder how differently things might have turned out, if this video had been broadcast on national TV sometime after the acquittal. Surely, it would have had a positive effect on how people viewed him. And that could have had a major impact on the course of Michael's life over the last few years. Who knows what might have happened, had Michael not felt the need to run away from the spotlight after the trial, and from a public that seemed only too happy to vilify him. But we'll never really know, will we?",4,Confirmed What I Believed,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,4122,"['never', 'believed', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'guilty', 'child', 'molestation', 'Not', ""'m"", 'top', 'obsessed', 'fan', 'who', 'icon', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'not', 'who', 'am', ""'m"", 'just', '42', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'tunes', 'once', 'awhile', 'loved', 'songs', 'hated', 'songs', 'was', 'never', 'one', 'follow', 'move', 'did', 'watch', 'music', 'video', 'try', 'catch', 'appearance', 'TV', 'was', 'however', 'always', 'intrigued', 'captivated', 'when', 'did', 'see', 'Michael', 'screen', 'hear', 'music', 'had', 'talent', 'commanded', 'attention', 'passion', 'helping', 'others', 'especially', 'children', 'always', 'admired', 'that.So', 'remember', 'standing', 'living', 'room', 'when', 'caught', 'glimpse', 'Michael', 'TV', 'spoke', 'out', 'horrible', 'crimes', 'child', 'had', 'been', 'accused', 'Just', 'looking', 'pain', 'eyes', 'listening', 'power', 'voice', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'child', 'molester', 'were', 'accusing', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'be', 'true', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'one', 'trace', 'guilt', 'man', 'face', 'voice', 'pleaded', 'world', 'not', 'condemn', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'do.But', 'media', 'sure', 'seemed', 'paint', 'different', 'picture', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'one', 'seemed', 'convict', 'early', 'was', 'so', 'insane', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'suddenly', 'looked', 'talked', 'differently', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'easy', 'believe', 'was', 'guilty', 'man', 'children', 'must', 'be', 'pervert', 'too', 'right', 'when', 'agreed', 'settle', 'accusers', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'seemed', 'make', 'everything', 'worse', 'many', 'people', 'made', 'guilty.When', 'second', 'case', 'came', 'along', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Michael', 'efforts', 'rebuild', 'image', 'had', 'become', 'so', 'badly', 'tarnished', 'many', 'who', 'had', 'reservations', 'innocence', 'new', 'charges', 'erased', 'doubt', 'not', 'very', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'someone', 'money', 'saw', 'pay', 'off', 'last', 'family', 'so', 'surely', ""'d"", 'pay', 'again', 'Easy', 'target', 'trial', 'unfolded', 'watched', 'sadness', 'once', 'energetic', 'magnetic', 'personality', 'seemed', 'withdraw', 'even', 'further', 'cocoon', 'obvious', 'pain', 'was', 'acquitted', 'single', 'charge', 'was', 'condemned', 'minds', 'many', 'people', 'viewed', 'freakish', 'form', 'evil', 'obsession', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'only', 'seemed', 'add', 'fuel', 'fire', 'could', 'tell', 'when', 'was', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'had', 'become', 'different', 'person', 'shell', 'former', 'vibrant', 'self', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'betrayed', 'felt', 'accusers', 'who', 'would', 'believe', 'most', 'vile', 'lies', 'wonder', 'left', 'country', 'When', 'found', 'DVD', 'last', 'week', 'ordered', 'right', 'away', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'definitely', 'confirmed', 'what', 'have', 'believed', 'entire', 'time', 'MICHAEL', 'JACKSON', 'WAS', 'INNOCENT', 'was', 'noted', 'DVD', 'was', 'guilty', 'anything', 'was', 'only', 'bad', 'judgment', 'sure', 'paid', 'high', 'price', 'so', 'many', 'ways.I', 'only', 'wish', 'video', 'had', 'aired', 'TV', 'long', 'ago', 'help', 'combat', 'lies', 'negativity', 'followed', 'MJ', 'even', 'long', 'acquittal', 'More', 'people', 'need', 'see', 'DVD', 'More', 'people', 'need', 'know', 'truth', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'talented', 'compassionate', 'caring', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'had', 'flaws', 'just', 'rest', 'was', 'not', 'child', 'molester', 'rather', 'was', 'victim', 'lies', 'outright', 'extortion', 'tabloid', 'journalism', 'would', 'follow', 'took', 'very', 'last', 'breath.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'differently', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'video', 'had', 'been', 'broadcast', 'national', 'TV', 'sometime', 'acquittal', 'Surely', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'positive', 'effect', 'how', 'people', 'viewed', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'major', 'impact', 'course', 'Michael', 'life', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Who', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'Michael', 'not', 'felt', 'need', 'run', 'away', 'spotlight', 'trial', 'public', 'seemed', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'vilify', ""'ll"", 'never', 'really', 'know', 'will']",Michael Jackson: The Untold Story of Neverland

More than 70 law enforcement officials swarmed the sanctuary and home of a gentle, innocent man and turned it into a public spectacle, violating him in such a disgusting, inhuman manner. This was a colossal ""witch hunt"".  Only his ""forced"" physical  examination could be have been worse.  He was treated like  some kind of unearthly terrorist.  Is it any wonder he could never, ever return home?Michael missed out on so many wonderful experiences of childhood so he sought to recreate it by turning this ranch into a child's fantasy paradise.  The children and adults who had the true pleasure of experiencing Neverland and possibly meeting Michael, were treated to an unforgettable day of fun and excitement.  Michael Jackson's heart was pure.  It is the evil that exists in all of us that caused him to endure so much pain and mental suffering because of perverted thoughts about things that never happened there.I am so grateful for Larry Nimmer's determination and insight to produce this video.  He does a great job of narrating it, too, describing the depth of violation that took place.  What did these cops expect to find?  It's what they didn't find that proves the insanity of this raid!How i pray that a caring journalist  takes this DVD and the two books--Redemption and Michael Jackson Conspiracy--and tells the true story about Michael Jackson and how he was demonized and destroyed by a blood-lusting DA, a jealous filmmaker, a legal-savvy and greed-motivated family,  and a horribly biased media.  People need to know that this man was innocent of all charges.  He deserves to be remembered for his genius talent, compassion and humanitarian efforts.In summation, you will want this DVD if you are a fan.  While it is heartbreaking to watch what took place there, you must realize that you have an important document that captures images of the beautiful place that Michael's magic created.Watch it and let it motivate you to join the legion of fans that won't rest until Michael's name is respected and revered for his goodness, talent, and pure love of children.Thanks, Mr. Nimmer.

Neels,"[4, 4]","i have read ""michael jackson conspiracy"" and that goes into so much detail about what i saw in this dvd, so i had a fuller understanding watching the movie.this dvd -1. seeing footage shot for the jury's virtual neverland tour2. michael jackson's accusers speaking on the record3. the sheiffs raid of neverland4. the accuser making his accusations on camera during a police interview5. clips of mj from the martin bashir documentary6. highlights from mj's careerextras section -1. mj speaking from the martin bashir documentary2. shows tours of neverland taken with larry nimmer commentary3. neverland sheriffs raid outtakes4. clips from the aborted rebuttal video by the arviso family5. tom mesereau and aphrodite jones disscussing the trial6. mj's victory party in las vegas7. messages to michael from his fans8. mj's fans mourning his passing in los angeles and neverlandthis dvd shows what an outstanding job tom mesereau does in mj's defense, prooving his innocence, which ended up being the verdict! i loved the part in the martin bashir documentary where michael jackson starts climbing a tree - i always have loved climbing trees and have done it to think by myself and have deep discussions with my friends ever since i was small and on through college - so i can totally relate with that part of mj. it makes me angry to know that martin bashir was trying to put this and a lot of other things about mj in a very untruthful and negative light. i also like seeing the michael jackson impersonators at the party scene in las vegas - some of them were pretty good at what they do - it was really cool to see how much support surrounded mj by his fans. the other thing i will mention that i thought was so sweet was the letter that paris wrote to mj during the trial - ""i love you daddy so much more then that get well daddy - love paris""this is totally a must-see dvd for anyone!!",5,happy to see truth prevailing,1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,1887,"['i', 'have', 'read', 'michael', 'jackson', 'conspiracy', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'what', 'i', 'saw', 'dvd', 'i', 'had', 'fuller', 'understanding', 'watching', 'movie.this', 'dvd', '-1.', 'seeing', 'footage', 'shot', 'jury', 'virtual', 'neverland', 'tour2', 'michael', 'jackson', 'accusers', 'speaking', 'record3', 'sheiffs', 'raid', 'neverland4', 'accuser', 'making', 'accusations', 'camera', 'police', 'interview5', 'clips', 'mj', 'martin', 'bashir', 'documentary6', 'highlights', 'mj', 'careerextras', 'section', '-1.', 'mj', 'speaking', 'martin', 'bashir', 'documentary2', 'tours', 'neverland', 'taken', 'larry', 'nimmer', 'commentary3', 'sheriffs', 'raid', 'outtakes4', 'clips', 'aborted', 'rebuttal', 'video', 'arviso', 'family5', 'tom', 'mesereau', 'aphrodite', 'jones', 'disscussing', 'trial6', 'mj', 'victory', 'party', 'las', 'vegas7', 'messages', 'michael', 'fans8', 'mj', 'fans', 'mourning', 'passing', 'los', 'angeles', 'neverlandthis', 'dvd', 'what', 'outstanding', 'job', 'tom', 'mesereau', 'mj', 'defense', 'prooving', 'innocence', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'verdict', 'i', 'loved', 'part', 'martin', 'bashir', 'documentary', 'where', 'michael', 'jackson', 'climbing', 'tree', 'i', 'always', 'have', 'loved', 'climbing', 'trees', 'have', 'done', 'think', 'have', 'deep', 'discussions', 'friends', 'ever', 'i', 'was', 'small', 'college', 'so', 'i', 'can', 'totally', 'relate', 'part', 'mj', 'angry', 'know', 'martin', 'bashir', 'was', 'trying', 'put', 'lot', 'other', 'things', 'mj', 'very', 'untruthful', 'negative', 'light', 'i', 'also', 'seeing', 'michael', 'jackson', 'impersonators', 'party', 'scene', 'las', 'vegas', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'support', 'surrounded', 'mj', 'fans', 'other', 'thing', 'i', 'will', 'mention', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'sweet', 'was', 'letter', 'wrote', 'mj', 'trial', 'i', 'love', 'daddy', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'then', 'get', 'well', 'daddy', 'love', 'paris', 'totally', 'must-see', 'dvd', 'anyone']",Michael Jackson: The Untold Story of Neverland

[they claimed it was all scripted and that michael's people forced them to say all those nice things about him]for all of you still wanting to know more facts about the trial, def. get this dvd.  larry's team responded very quickly to me and i got the dvd in a very timely manner.  i hope one day, him, aphrodite, geraldine hughes and tom mesereau will all go on larry king and really inform the public on all the facts surrounding this case.  it really saddens me that there's still many people out there that are still mis-informed or too ignorant to know the facts.",5,very informative and clobbers the prosecution's accusations...,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,2341,"['i', 'bought', 'larry', 'website', 'actually', 'discovered', 'more', 'facts', 'regarding', 'trial', 'someone', 'who', 'followed', 'ofthis', '1993', 'personally', 'never', 'knew', 'arvisos', 'prosecution', 'claimed', '[', 'arviso', 'family', ']', 'were', 'prevented', 'knowing', 'time', 'seemed', 'very', 'odd', 'media', 'shot', 'neverland', 'almost', 'always', 'huge', 'grassy', 'clock', 'i', 'also', 'was', 'curious', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'janet', 'booking', 'photo', 'time', 'infamous', 'jc', 'penney', 'case', 'looked', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'upset', 'crying', 'injured', 'etc', 'someone', 'who', 'claimed', 'have', 'been', 'beaten', 'up', 'parking', 'lot', 'jc', 'penney', 'only', 'critique', 'larry', 'would', 'be', 'could', 'include', 'chapter', 'selections', 'main', 'content', 'example', 'i', 'were', 'rewinding', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'something', 'i', 'wanted', 'see', 'would', 'go', 'right', 'back', 'very', 'beginning', 'very', 'end', 'other', 'information', 'facts', 'are', 'well', 'i', 'especially', 'liked', 'mini-interview', 'did', 'tom', 'mesereau', 'aphrodite', 'jones', 'extras', 'depth', 'interviews', 'did', 'mesereau', 'jury', 'foreman', 'course', 'gavin', ""'confession"", 'sheriffs', 'kid', 'looked', 'lot', 'bigger', 'older', 'what', 'media', 'was', 'portraying', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'traumatized', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'i', 'agree', 'aphrodite', 'how', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'not', 'know', 'basic', 'questions', 'sexuality', 'seeing', 'football', 'uniform', 'totally', 'blew', 'away', 'mean', 'tell', 'play', 'football', 'deal', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'stronger', 'michael', 'jackson', 'let', 'touch', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'also', 'outtake', 'footage', 'arvisos', 'did', 'being', 'very', 'spontaneous', 'times', 'not', 'knowing', 'were', 'being', 'taped', 'claimed', 'was', 'scripted', 'michael', 'people', 'forced', 'say', 'nice', 'things', ']', 'still', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'facts', 'trial', 'def', 'get', 'dvd', 'larry', 'team', 'responded', 'very', 'quickly', 'i', 'got', 'dvd', 'very', 'timely', 'manner', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'aphrodite', 'geraldine', 'hughes', 'tom', 'mesereau', 'will', 'go', 'larry', 'king', 'really', 'inform', 'public', 'facts', 'surrounding', 'case', 'really', 'still', 'many', 'people', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'still', 'mis-informed', 'too', 'ignorant', 'know', 'facts']",Michael Jackson: The Untold Story of Neverland
1266079,A2561PTXI27C9G,B002FBH83O,Unique,"[3, 3]","I gave this documentary 5 stars for the enclosed material which this photographer decided to share. Although I appreciated the various categories documented as extras along with the main documentary of ""The Untold Story of Neverland"", it actually brought tears to my eyes to see that the media/press needlessly chose to ignore the factual circumstances of the court fiasco! Since the media filled the courts during the trail, they were aware of this photographer, Larry Nimmer's factual Neverland video presentation to the court and deliberately chose not to report it!Michael didn't deserve ANY of this!!! I always knew he was completely innocent, but to see these conniving officers desecrate his beautiful home was sooo disgusting! As I cried, feeling so much pain, I kept thinking how Michael felt! This was HIS home yet I felt like I was the one being stabbed. That alone lets one imagine just how deeply HE was hurt! It just angered me all over again! Neverland was fantastically beautiful!!! It was undoubtedly understandable why MJ refused to live there anymore the way they defiled his peaceful territory with their evil spirits!On the positive side, you get to hear Tom Mesereau (Michael's attorney), author Aphrodite Jones (The Michael Jackson Conspiracy), author Geraldine Hughes (Redemption), and MJ fans! Although I'd say this dvd is a keeper, it's also a great one to share with those who're skeptical about MJ's innocence because this dvd is all the proof they'll need to see how wrong they were in believing the media/press lies.I'm very glad that I purchased this documentary dvd.
