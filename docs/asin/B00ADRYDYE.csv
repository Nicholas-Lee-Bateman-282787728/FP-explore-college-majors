When they make their way down to Earth, Jack must figure out how to get back down and save everyone from the oncoming threat.To be honest, the biggest selling point of this movie for me was Ben Cross. Some of you out there may remember him in movies(such as A Bridge Too Far, Chariots of Fire, First Knight, Exorcist: The Beginning & Star Trek) or TV(such as Dark Shadows: The Revival, William & Kate and Super Tanker).Despite the fact that this is, supposed to be, a mockbuster of Bryan Singer's Jack the Giant Slayer; it's anything but..I assure you. I have to admit that Jack the Giant Killer was a very decent take on the fairy tales: Jack the Giant Killer and Jack and the Beanstalk. I really did enjoy the movie. With its' mostly British cast, you can tell that everyone enjoyed their part in this movie and it shows. That's why I enjoyed watching it. My only gripe, honestly, was the fact that the movie was way too short. By the time I got into it, it was over and done with.I know I mention this in practically every review for an Asylum film but The Asylum seems to get better and better at their movies with each and every one they produce. Sure, every once in awhile- along comes one that reeks(most recently, Super Cyclone..&lt;covers nose>). For the most part, however, they're getting better. For that, I have to give 'em their props.

1607752,A2U83VDVJMAB2U,B00ADRYDYE,Brian Baker,"[6, 6]","Until I read the other reviews, I had no idea what a ""mockbuster"" was. Apparently the producers of this so-called ""movie"", The Asylum, have a business model that entails waiting until just before the release of some legitimate movie, then they release their own near-identically named version to try to leach some income from potential confusion in the marketplace. In this case, the ""victim"" movie is ""Jack the Giant SLAYER"".Hmmmm..... On top of producing terrible movies, it sounds to me like they're ethically challenged, too.ANYhoooo....I watched this on DVD last night, and afterward I kept trying to think of any movie I'd ever seen that was worse. After many hours, my answer is ""none"". Bar none, this IS the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. As a matter of fact, it's so bad that even calling it a ""movie"" is an insult to all actual movies. This thing deserves a word all to itself; something new.Nowhere is any actual ""acting"" to be seen, let alone ""directing"". This is literally the result you'd expect if you unleashed the proverbial unlimited number of monkeys among some camera equipment to see what they came up with. Actually, they'd probably do better.Every penny of the budget is right up there on the screen, not a penny (or farthing) wasted.... all $3.87 of it.The ""special effects"" and ""CGI"" made me wonder where they managed to dig up some old Commodore 64s that were still working.I especially loved the scenes involving the Brit military, in which a General was commanding the responding force of, oh... about 10 guys armed with a motley mix of WW2 weapons. Really believable, that. His second-in-command was a sergeant. I knew money was tight in Old Blighty, but I never realized the depths of their budget cuts. Time to revisit that socialized medicine deal, guys.Interestingly enough, the character of ""Jack the Giant Killer"" never actually kills any GIANTS. He does kill a big lizard; that's about it. As a matter of fact, there's not a single ""giant"" in the entire ... ""movie""? There's that word problem again. Apparently, all the ""giants"" were killed by another character before this movie even supposedly took place. Maybe having to have some actual giants would have placed a budget strain on the production somehow, running it up over the $4.00 limit. Could be...Lizards were cheaper. No lines to learn, etc. Like that.Well, I could go on, but I think you get the point. Avoid this mess like the plague. And judging by the previews on the disc, avoid ANYTHING by The Asylum production company.",1,"Howlingly, amazingly, incredibly terrible movie",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,2530,"['read', 'other', 'reviews', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'mockbuster', 'was', 'Apparently', 'producers', 'so-called', 'movie', 'Asylum', 'have', 'business', 'model', 'waiting', 'just', 'release', 'legitimate', 'movie', 'then', 'release', 'own', 'near-identically', 'named', 'version', 'try', 'leach', 'income', 'potential', 'confusion', 'marketplace', 'case', 'victim', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'SLAYER', '.Hmmmm', '..', 'top', 'producing', 'terrible', 'movies', ""'re"", 'ethically', 'challenged', 'too.ANYhoooo', '.I', 'watched', 'DVD', 'last', 'night', 'afterward', 'kept', 'trying', 'think', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'worse', 'many', 'hours', 'answer', 'none', 'Bar', 'none', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'matter', 'fact', 'so', 'bad', 'even', 'calling', 'movie', 'insult', 'actual', 'movies', 'thing', 'word', 'something', 'new.Nowhere', 'actual', 'acting', 'be', 'seen', 'let', 'alone', 'directing', 'literally', 'result', ""'d"", 'expect', 'unleashed', 'proverbial', 'unlimited', 'number', 'monkeys', 'camera', 'equipment', 'see', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'Actually', ""'d"", 'probably', 'do', 'penny', 'budget', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'screen', 'not', 'penny', 'farthing', 'wasted', '3.87', 'it.The', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'made', 'wonder', 'where', 'managed', 'dig', 'up', 'old', 'Commodore', '64s', 'were', 'still', 'working.I', 'especially', 'loved', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Brit', 'military', 'General', 'was', 'commanding', 'responding', 'force', 'oh', 'about', '10', 'guys', 'armed', 'motley', 'mix', 'WW2', 'weapons', 'Really', 'believable', 'second-in-command', 'was', 'sergeant', 'knew', 'money', 'was', 'tight', 'Old', 'Blighty', 'never', 'realized', 'depths', 'budget', 'cuts', 'Time', 'revisit', 'socialized', 'medicine', 'deal', 'guys.Interestingly', 'enough', 'character', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Killer', 'never', 'actually', 'GIANTS', 'kill', 'big', 'lizard', 'matter', 'fact', 'not', 'single', 'giant', 'entire', 'movie', 'word', 'problem', 'again', 'Apparently', 'giants', 'were', 'killed', 'character', 'movie', 'even', 'supposedly', 'took', 'place', 'Maybe', 'having', 'have', 'actual', 'giants', 'would', 'have', 'placed', 'budget', 'strain', 'production', 'somehow', 'running', 'up', '4.00', 'limit', 'Could', 'be', 'Lizards', 'were', 'cheaper', 'lines', 'learn', 'etc', 'that.Well', 'could', 'go', 'think', 'get', 'point', 'Avoid', 'mess', 'plague', 'judging', 'previews', 'disc', 'ANYTHING', 'Asylum', 'production', 'company']",Jack the Giant Killer

Jack (Jamie Atkins) plants magic beans, climbs and meets his long lost father (Harry Dyer). There is a ""queen"" (Jane March) who lives up there too, as well as creatures who look and act like Gumby had sex with a dinosaur. The production had a Jules Verne quality to it, but unfortunately they couldn't bring that home. The beginning of the feature opens by showing us a scene near the end, one where Jack, using stuff laying around the garage makes himself an Iron Man suit for no apparent reason.Some of the language and visuals had enough camp value to it to make the film entertaining while other aspects simply fail. Modern helicopters, crank battery powered army field phones, bright yellow rotary phones, and what looked like 60's automobiles.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. In one scene the queen stands up and faces Newald, the father. She is apparently nude from the look on his face, but we only see her from behind from about the knees down. 3 stars for the camp value.",3,WANT TO TOUCH MY MAGIC BEANS?,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,1289,"['Asylum', 'mock', 'buster', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'mockbuster', 'nothing', 'common', 'plot', 'original', 'film', 'just', 'hope', 'get', 'confused', 'buy', 'DVD.This', 'movie', 'place', 'somewhat', 'anachronistic', 'setting', 'maybe', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Jack', 'Jamie', 'Atkins', 'plants', 'magic', 'beans', 'climbs', 'meets', 'long', 'lost', 'father', 'Harry', 'Dyer', 'queen', 'Jane', 'March', 'who', 'up', 'there', 'too', 'as', 'well', 'creatures', 'who', 'look', 'act', 'Gumby', 'had', 'sex', 'dinosaur', 'production', 'had', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'quality', 'unfortunately', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'home', 'beginning', 'feature', 'showing', 'scene', 'end', 'one', 'where', 'Jack', 'using', 'stuff', 'laying', 'garage', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'apparent', 'reason.Some', 'language', 'visuals', 'had', 'enough', 'camp', 'value', 'make', 'film', 'entertaining', 'other', 'aspects', 'simply', 'fail', 'Modern', 'helicopters', 'crank', 'battery', 'powered', 'army', 'field', 'phones', 'bright', 'yellow', 'rotary', 'phones', 'what', 'looked', '60', 'automobiles.Parental', 'Guide', 'f-bombs', 'sex', 'nudity', 'one', 'scene', 'queen', 'up', 'Newald', 'father', 'apparently', 'nude', 'look', 'face', 'only', 'see', 'knees', 'down', '3', 'stars', 'camp', 'value']",Jack the Giant Killer
