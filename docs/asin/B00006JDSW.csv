717708,A17ZQWVYCXHV4G,B00006JDSW,Anime Fan,"[0, 0]","The Final Judgement was awesome!!! Yue was cold, calculating and nothing like his alternate form, the kindhearted Yukito. Even though you get the impression that he wanted to destroy Sakura during the trials, it was more of a test to see if she deserved to be the new master of the Clow Cards. What a test, after hitting her with a barrage ice and slamming her from one part of Tokyo Tower to the next, she eventually manages to turn tide and beat the judge...yay ^_^. Sakura told Yue the she didn't want to become their master, but rather a friend, aww[...] This in turn surprises him and he accepts her as their new master. Now a new transfer student has arrived named Eroil Hiragizawa and seems very friendly with Sakura, which also makes Li extremely jealous. Sakura's brother Touya also has a new transfer student named Nakura Akizuki joining his class and she seems to have an affinity for jumping on his back and giving him great big hugs. Unknown to everyone, with the exception for Touya, these new students are going to cause major problems for our favorite Cardcaptor. I could go on and type more, but why not pick up a copy for yourself and enjoy this really cute anime from the art team of CLAMP.",5,"I love it, absolutely love it!!!",1038873600,"12 3, 2002",2002,1209,"['Final', 'Judgement', 'was', 'awesome', 'Yue', 'was', 'cold', 'calculating', 'nothing', 'alternate', 'form', 'kindhearted', 'Yukito', 'Even', 'get', 'impression', 'wanted', 'destroy', 'Sakura', 'trials', 'was', 'more', 'test', 'see', 'deserved', 'be', 'new', 'master', 'Clow', 'Cards', 'What', 'test', 'hitting', 'barrage', 'ice', 'slamming', 'one', 'part', 'Tokyo', 'Tower', 'next', 'eventually', 'turn', 'tide', 'beat', 'judge', 'yay', '^_^', 'Sakura', 'told', 'Yue', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'become', 'master', 'rather', 'friend', 'aww', '[', 'turn', 'surprises', 'new', 'master', 'Now', 'new', 'transfer', 'student', 'arrived', 'named', 'Eroil', 'Hiragizawa', 'very', 'friendly', 'Sakura', 'also', 'Li', 'extremely', 'jealous', 'Sakura', 'brother', 'Touya', 'also', 'new', 'transfer', 'student', 'named', 'Nakura', 'Akizuki', 'joining', 'class', 'have', 'affinity', 'jumping', 'back', 'giving', 'great', 'big', 'hugs', 'everyone', 'exception', 'Touya', 'new', 'students', 'are', 'going', 'cause', 'major', 'problems', 'favorite', 'Cardcaptor', 'could', 'go', 'type', 'more', 'why', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'yourself', 'enjoy', 'really', 'cute', 'anime', 'art', 'team', 'CLAMP']",N/A

Anyways this is about Sakura who captured the last and final card &quot;The Earth&quot;. She is now happy and all but Julian transformed into a powerful person named Yue. Sakura did not want to defeat him sense he had his other body as Julian. Sakura had to. This was the final showdown as Sakura used one of the clow cards &quot;The Wood&quot; and thought that this would end but she was wrong, Yue had used his powers and turned The Wood card back to her. She thought that she was going to loose but then her teacher Mrs. Mackenzie helped her when Mrs. Mackenzie used one of her powers. (Its some kind of thing she holds in her hand but anyways) When Sakura got untangled from the vines of The Wood card Sakura hold the staff up and turned the staff into a star staff. Sakura used one of her cards &quot;The Windy&quot; and the card transfromed into a star card. The Windy captured Yue. Yue was now friends with Sakura and Sakura's friends. Now as Sakura turns clow cards into star cards her journey will end. (This is not in this video but after Sakura had done all this there was a transformed student from England named Eli, Sakura thought there was something strange about Eli.) Anyways this video contains three parts: Part 1, Part 2 and The Final Judgement. You will enjoy this video.
