More recently now I have wanted to have it on DVD and am very glad to find it.  It is a great story recalling the years of WWII.  I like the footage of air combat inserted into the modern story of characters and what could have happened to people who lived those war years.  I really like the actors who were chosen to play all of the main characters.  The DVD is good.",5,Reunion at Fairborough DVD,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,435,"['loved', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'More', 'recently', 'now', 'have', 'wanted', 'have', 'DVD', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'find', 'great', 'story', 'recalling', 'years', 'WWII', 'footage', 'air', 'combat', 'inserted', 'modern', 'story', 'characters', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'war', 'years', 'really', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'chosen', 'play', 'main', 'characters', 'DVD', 'good']",Reunion At Fairborough

1526352,A19ELFMMKB83HC,B0074JOVFK,"J. Carey ""waymorefun""","[0, 0]","This is a very well thought out film about a group of guys who served together in WW2 and were stationed in England going back to the old base for a reunion years later.  Mitchum and Kerr reunite on film and in the story and really help to notch this up.  Red Buttons does a great job as one of the vets.  There is a side story about a child from a war time romance and her interaction with the vets.  Nice to see a romance on film for those of us over 50.  I'm sure that anyone who enjoys a good film, about real people, or the war or seeing real actors for the 40's and 50's still doing good work will like this one.",5,Good film with great cast,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,618,"['very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'film', 'group', 'guys', 'who', 'served', 'together', 'WW2', 'were', 'stationed', 'England', 'going', 'back', 'old', 'base', 'reunion', 'years', 'later', 'Mitchum', 'Kerr', 'reunite', 'film', 'story', 'really', 'help', 'notch', 'up', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'great', 'job', 'one', 'vets', 'side', 'story', 'child', 'war', 'time', 'romance', 'interaction', 'vets', 'Nice', 'see', 'romance', 'film', '50', ""'m"", 'sure', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'film', 'about', 'real', 'people', 'war', 'seeing', 'real', 'actors', '40', '50', 'still', 'doing', 'good', 'work', 'will', 'like', 'one']",Reunion At Fairborough

1526359,A9AI9WH600I1I,B0074JOVFK,William Dodd,"[0, 0]","I normally only write reviews for products I really like.  In this case, I was disappointed.  Mitchum and Kerr were in three very enjoyable movies together before this one.  Each is a fine actor--among the very best of the 20th Century.  We tended to take both of them for granted.  I won't spend time on the plot of this made-for-HBO movie-- that's been covered quite well.  The reunion of the former military personnel is believable and touching.  Red Buttons plays Red Buttons, as always.  The various storylines are adequate.  Overall, the production shows its low budget.  The writing is weak in spots.  Mitchum and Kerr do their best to elevate the movie.  But the history of these two actors deserved a script that really showcased their abilities and their chemistry together.  I have a large library of films, and I can appreciate many movies that aren't going to make anyone's top ten list. I'm not that hard to please.  I probably have more films with Mitchum than any other single actor--and more with Deborah Kerr than any other single actress.  The producers were lucky to have them, but should have given them much more to work with.Buy it?  I did, but I don't know that I'm likely to watch it again.  As I say, a missed opportunity to make something really special.",3,A missed opportunity,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,1281,"['normally', 'only', 'write', 'reviews', 'products', 'really', 'case', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Mitchum', 'Kerr', 'were', 'three', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'together', 'one', 'fine', 'actor', 'very', 'best', '20th', 'Century', 'tended', 'take', 'granted', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'plot', 'made-for-HBO', 'movie', 'been', 'covered', 'quite', 'well', 'reunion', 'former', 'military', 'personnel', 'believable', 'touching', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'plays', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'always', 'various', 'storylines', 'are', 'adequate', 'Overall', 'production', 'low', 'budget', 'writing', 'weak', 'spots', 'Mitchum', 'Kerr', 'do', 'best', 'elevate', 'movie', 'history', 'two', 'actors', 'deserved', 'script', 'really', 'showcased', 'abilities', 'chemistry', 'together', 'have', 'large', 'library', 'films', 'can', 'appreciate', 'many', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'anyone', 'top', 'ten', 'list', ""'m"", 'not', 'that', 'please', 'probably', 'have', 'more', 'films', 'Mitchum', 'other', 'single', 'actor', 'more', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'other', 'single', 'actress', 'producers', 'were', 'lucky', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'much', 'more', 'work', 'with.Buy', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'likely', 'watch', 'again', 'say', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'make', 'something', 'really', 'special']",Reunion At Fairborough
