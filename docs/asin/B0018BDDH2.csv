1159518,A23ZTX5UAU59TF,B0018BDDH2,game lover,"[3, 3]","Good storytelling; the episodes never fail to entertain and the atmosphere has a Gothic feel to it, although slightly campy at times, somewhat like the old ""Dark Shadows"". Plotline continuity does suffer sometimes in my opinion; I was particularly disappointed that they killed off the beautiful ""Abigail"" character played by Kari Wuhrer for no apparent good reason.Speaking of Abby, it seems rather unfortunate at first glance that the Swamp Thing is not provided the same love interest as the Abigail of the DC comic series or the feature films (in the second one she was played by Heather Locklear!) thus helping him forget his sorrows over losing his first wife and being half man and half plant, torn between the two identities and with no apparent way to ease his tortured mind. For much of this installment of episodes, he just can't really seem to get a break! Wait, stop the press -- he does eventually manage to develop a relationship with a lovely and intelligent woman who cares for him and wants to help him regain his humanity. So perhaps, in the end, he truly gets to experience the best of both worlds!Although it has its shortcomings, for fans of the DC series as well as lovers of weird stories, this series is an interesting adaptation of the DC Comics saga and certainly worth a look.",4,Campy but cool,1230163200,"12 25, 2008",2008,1304,"['Good', 'storytelling', 'episodes', 'never', 'fail', 'entertain', 'atmosphere', 'Gothic', 'feel', 'slightly', 'campy', 'times', 'somewhat', 'old', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Plotline', 'continuity', 'suffer', 'sometimes', 'opinion', 'was', 'particularly', 'disappointed', 'killed', 'off', 'beautiful', 'Abigail', 'character', 'played', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'apparent', 'good', 'reason.Speaking', 'Abby', 'rather', 'unfortunate', 'first', 'glance', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'not', 'provided', 'same', 'love', 'interest', 'Abigail', 'DC', 'comic', 'series', 'feature', 'films', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'played', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'thus', 'helping', 'forget', 'sorrows', 'losing', 'first', 'wife', 'being', 'half', 'man', 'half', 'plant', 'torn', 'two', 'identities', 'apparent', 'way', 'ease', 'tortured', 'mind', 'much', 'installment', 'episodes', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'get', 'break', 'Wait', 'stop', 'press', 'eventually', 'manage', 'develop', 'relationship', 'lovely', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'who', 'help', 'regain', 'humanity', 'So', 'perhaps', 'end', 'truly', 'experience', 'best', 'worlds', 'shortcomings', 'fans', 'DC', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'lovers', 'weird', 'stories', 'series', 'interesting', 'adaptation', 'DC', 'Comics', 'saga', 'certainly', 'look']","Swamp Thing: The Series, Volume 2"

1159522,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,B0018BDDH2,"The Critic ""Movie Maniac""","[3, 4]","Fans of the ""Swamp Thing"" now have 25 more reasons to Shout! Based on the DC comic book character, the ""Swamp Thing"" has returned for the first 25 episodes of the third and final season of this campy television series. The show ran from 1990-1993 and totaled 72 episodes. For the first time ever fans can see the first 25 episodes from the 50 episode final season the way they were meant to be seen, in order. All we need now is the final 25 episodes to complete the series.This half hour show wasn't always the best. The plots were flawed and some stories were definitely better than others. The show was hilarious campy entertainment, not as good as the original movie but definitely better than the sequel in 1989. One thing that never changed throughout the series was the ""Swamp Thing"" creature. His make-up and costume were well done and Dick Durock was once again great in reprising his role of the mutant monster from the swamp.This four disc set from Shout Factory is a must for any fan of the show. All 25 episodes are spread out over four single sided discs with great artwork and slim case packaging. The video transfer in my opinion is excellent and the sound is crisp and clean and it sounds great on my home theater system. I have really enjoyed watching the first 25 episodes of season three in order and I look forward to collecting the final 25 episodes to complete the series, hopefully soon. Thanks!
