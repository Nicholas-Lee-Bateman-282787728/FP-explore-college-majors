1602696,A3M1EKSN23SVOJ,B009VXVMAO,"DICK YORK IS THE BETTER DICK ""Sterculeus Erectus""","[1, 1]","I will be brief. Characters are real, situations real, the way they handle them , almost real. (In reality a little more force would have been used by LA cops) (Some tear gas, more units caled to riot or public disturbance scenes (sorry two patrol cars for mobs of 30 Latino gang members seems a tad too much to accept. Still it has great characters, a nice ensemble cast, some fly camera work in chase scenes, and a deep rich background and backdrop. The dialogue is as real as it can be with profanity.I have tow main issues with the show1)TNT in its greed---in Season 2-3-4 (NOT season 5 now which runs longer) had episodes clocking in without commercials at 40.23 seconds. Come on guys-ina 60 minute progema you want us to accept 33% of the progeam is commercials? If you say ""But dont ALL one hour dramas do that today""?> Answer NO. the running time on networks (ABC , CBS, NBC etc) is 43-44 m inutes per episode. TNT greedy for commercial revenue lets an extra 3 minutes of commercials air meaning three minutes LESS of an episode. Not fair.2)Violence.-gunshots-NO Blood. COme on--in a gritty police show--Not ONE bullet ""impact"" blood quibb shot. The series has yet to show ONE. I assume TNT has a ban on that (its not on any other TNT show either)..but if you are going to be as realistic as possible..a few impact shots would add greatly to the reality, the consequences of actions and make for the true most gritty polcie show since Police Story in the 70s! I mean when people are shot they DO bleed. This series finds ways to HIDE that. (People turn their backs, shots come from distant angles or are just hidden). I do not see how it is fine to say words like S..T and F..K but not show a couple  realistic shoot outs. Fix the ban on gunshot impacts and we have the best cop series to ever air...Season 5 picks up where Season 4 eneded and the show gets better every season.

So the idiots ""protect"" me from cursing while pitching products that increase the size of one's penis and excite your girlfriend like she has never been excited before.I did out of principal make Amazon give me my two bucks back, which they grudgingly did, and had some hope (not too much hope) that some idiot in the marketing department would get a clue that you cannot sell censorship to people who pay, and that censorship is for the Broadcast Networks, although its starting to prevail on cable (Which is why I download now, and cancelled my cable).Still I haven't bought the Southland DVDs because I'm not sure if the censorship is continuing, and of course I'm not buying two seasons twice.

1602715,AX9ZYSNJKJJK6,B009VXVMAO,R. Wolfe,"[10, 11]","Southland is one of the best cop shows ever to air.  It's got that immediate sense of danger that comes from hand-held camera work and well-executed, fast-paced action (it's not all frenetic, head-achy camera work, though; it's used to good effect).  The plots are intelligent and at times surprising and even brutal.  The characters are well-developed, and their personalities, back-stories and situations will stay with you, even haunt you the way certain characters or scenes from The Shield were able to, which is probably the show I would most compare it to, though Southland is not about the anti-hero.  It is similar in that it is one of the only shows that will leave you bolt-upright and riding an adrenaline rush right up to that last second--and then you can't believe you have to wait for next week (or next season) for the next episode.  I think Sons of Anarchy is the only other show currently airing that has this effect to this degree.  Again, though, Southland is not about the anti-hero; so it's not like Sons in that way at all.  The cops are heroes on this show, well revered, if completely human and at times very flawed.  This show seems to me to be a kind of a cross between the cop-centric, officer-on-the-beat episodes of Third Watch with the grittiness of the Shield.  What a wild ride all of these seasons in one set would be.  If you haven't seen this show before, I envy you the experience coming your way.  Please note that this show has ""seasons"" on par with the average BBC show in length, which means that with three full seasons of Southland included in this set, you will still only get 26 episodes.  So, consider it a single season's worth of shows (well, maybe a season from like the 80's, when networks actually still made 26-episode seasons).  Still, worth even overpaying for, it's that good.  If you haven't seen the first season, grab that and extend the awesome by 7 more episodes (yes, 7).  Oh, by the way, Southland incorporates an amount of uncensored swearing (at least my 1st season set does) that would make Sipowicz from NYPD Blue blush.  It's not that non-stop vulgarity the Wire delivers throughout; it's more like pointed punctuation that is realistic and not written around or out.  It works, if that sort of thing isn't a deal-breaker for you.  (When the show airs on TV, most of the curse words are dropped out of the sound.  Hopefully, this set continues the tradition of just leaving the colorful, realistic language in there, though.)  In short, a fantastic cop show that has probably flown under your radar.  Spend whatever they're charging; it may seem like too much, but after you're sucked into a few episodes, you'll think it was a steal.",5,"Gritty, Realistic, Thrill Ride",1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,2702,"['Southland', 'one', 'best', 'cop', 'ever', 'air', 'got', 'immediate', 'sense', 'danger', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'well-executed', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'not', 'frenetic', 'head-achy', 'camera', 'work', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'plots', 'are', 'intelligent', 'times', 'surprising', 'even', 'brutal', 'characters', 'are', 'well-developed', 'personalities', 'back-stories', 'situations', 'will', 'stay', 'even', 'haunt', 'way', 'certain', 'characters', 'scenes', 'Shield', 'were', 'able', 'probably', 'show', 'would', 'most', 'compare', 'Southland', 'not', 'anti-hero', 'similar', 'one', 'only', 'will', 'leave', 'bolt-upright', 'riding', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'right', 'up', 'last', 'second', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', 'wait', 'next', 'week', 'next', 'season', 'next', 'episode', 'think', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'only', 'other', 'show', 'currently', 'airing', 'effect', 'degree', 'Again', 'though', 'Southland', 'not', 'anti-hero', 'not', 'like', 'Sons', 'way', 'cops', 'are', 'heroes', 'show', 'well', 'revered', 'completely', 'human', 'times', 'very', 'flawed', 'show', 'be', 'kind', 'cross', 'cop-centric', 'officer-on-the-beat', 'episodes', 'Third', 'Watch', 'grittiness', 'Shield', 'What', 'wild', 'ride', 'seasons', 'one', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'envy', 'experience', 'coming', 'way', 'Please', 'note', 'show', 'seasons', 'par', 'average', 'BBC', 'show', 'length', 'three', 'full', 'seasons', 'Southland', 'included', 'set', 'will', 'still', 'only', 'get', '26', 'episodes', 'So', 'consider', 'single', 'season', 'worth', 'shows', 'well', 'maybe', 'season', '80', 'when', 'networks', 'actually', 'still', 'made', '26-episode', 'seasons', 'Still', 'worth', 'even', 'overpaying', 'good', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'grab', 'extend', 'awesome', '7', 'more', 'episodes', 'yes', '7', 'Oh', 'way', 'Southland', 'amount', 'uncensored', 'swearing', 'least', '1st', 'season', 'set', 'would', 'make', 'Sipowicz', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'blush', 'not', 'non-stop', 'vulgarity', 'Wire', 'delivers', 'more', 'pointed', 'punctuation', 'realistic', 'not', 'written', 'sort', 'thing', ""n't"", 'deal-breaker', 'When', 'show', 'TV', 'most', 'curse', 'words', 'are', 'dropped', 'sound', 'Hopefully', 'set', 'tradition', 'just', 'leaving', 'colorful', 'realistic', 'language', 'there', 'short', 'fantastic', 'cop', 'show', 'probably', 'flown', 'radar', 'Spend', ""'re"", 'charging', 'may', 'seem', 'too', 'much', ""'re"", 'sucked', 'few', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'think', 'was', 'steal']",Southland:S2-4 (DVD)
