The brainchild of creator Shawn Ryan, writer for such hit shows as Nash Bridges (1996) and Angel (1999), The Shield made history in 2003 by becoming the first basic cable series to win a Golden Globe for Best Drama Series (in the past, only non-ad supported shows such as The Sopranos and Sex And The City have done so well). The hour-long drama boasts a strong, well-rounded cast who, along with the writers/producers, have managed to make The Shield the longest running series on the FX Network...The Shield centers around an inner-city Los Angeles police precinct where the lines between right and wrong are often blurred. An ongoing power struggle between a group of corrupt, yet effective, cops and their new boss, Capt. David Aceveda (Benito Martinez), remains the focal point of the show. Det. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis, of The Commish) heads up an elite unit known as the Strike Team. An effective leader who bends the rules when they fit his aims, Mackey often butts heads with the by-the-book Aceveda who weighs his own political ambitions against the cost of bringing down Mackey and his associates. Veteran Det. Claudette Wyms (CCH Pounder, of ER) knows the ropes, admires Mackey, but also knows how to play sides of the game. For the 2005 season, Glenn Close - star of such films as The Natural (1984), Fatal Attraction (1987), and Air Force One (1997) - joined the cast as Capt. Monica Rawling. Together, this celebrated cast maintains an internal tension among themselves while carrying out a unified fight against the criminal element - a fight that keeps the streets of L.A. safe...The Shield (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Playing Tight"" in which the Strike Team's efforts to end their corruption are put to an end when they discover that two gangs are attempting to acquire more deadly weaponry. Meanwhile, Dutch and Claudette investigate the murders of four men by the Armenian mob... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Safe"" in which Mackey and the Strike Team go to great lengths to keep themselves from being linked to the money train heist, and ""All In"" in which the Strike Team anxiously sweeps the streets for a purported Armenian hit-man before he gets to them first...Below is a list of episodes included on The Shield (Season 3) DVD:Episode 27 (Playing Tight)Episode 28 (Blood and Water)Episode 29 (Bottom Bitch)Episode 30 (Streaks and Tips)Episode 31 (Mum)Episode 32 (Posse Up)Episode 33 (Safe)Episode 34 (Cracking Ice)Episode 35 (Slipknot)Episode 36 (What Power is...)Episode 37 (Strays)Episode 38 (Riceburner)Episode 39 (Fire in the Hole)Episode 40 (All In)Episode 41 (On Tilt)The DVD Report",5,A fascinating series...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,2838,"['Nominated', '4', 'Emmys', '4', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'including', 'Best', 'Television', 'Series', 'Drama', 'Shield', 'one', 'top', 'police', 'dramas', 'past', 'decade', 'brainchild', 'creator', 'Shawn', 'Ryan', 'writer', 'such', 'hit', 'shows', 'Nash', 'Bridges', '1996', 'Angel', '1999', 'Shield', 'made', 'history', '2003', 'becoming', 'first', 'basic', 'cable', 'series', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Drama', 'Series', 'past', 'only', 'non-ad', 'supported', 'shows', 'such', 'Sopranos', 'Sex', 'City', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'hour-long', 'drama', 'strong', 'well-rounded', 'cast', 'who', 'writers/producers', 'have', 'managed', 'make', 'Shield', 'longest', 'running', 'series', 'FX', 'Network', 'Shield', 'centers', 'inner-city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'police', 'precinct', 'where', 'lines', 'right', 'wrong', 'are', 'often', 'blurred', 'ongoing', 'power', 'struggle', 'group', 'corrupt', 'yet', 'effective', 'cops', 'new', 'boss', 'Capt', 'David', 'Aceveda', 'Benito', 'Martinez', 'focal', 'point', 'show', 'Det', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Commish', 'up', 'elite', 'unit', 'known', 'Strike', 'Team', 'effective', 'leader', 'who', 'rules', 'when', 'fit', 'aims', 'Mackey', 'often', 'heads', 'by-the-book', 'Aceveda', 'who', 'own', 'political', 'ambitions', 'cost', 'bringing', 'down', 'Mackey', 'associates', 'Veteran', 'Det', 'Claudette', 'Wyms', 'CCH', 'Pounder', 'ER', 'ropes', 'admires', 'Mackey', 'also', 'how', 'play', 'sides', 'game', '2005', 'season', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'star', 'such', 'films', 'Natural', '1984', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', '1987', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', '1997', 'joined', 'cast', 'Capt', 'Monica', 'Rawling', 'Together', 'celebrated', 'cast', 'internal', 'tension', 'carrying', 'out', 'unified', 'fight', 'criminal', 'element', 'fight', 'streets', 'L.A', 'safe', 'Shield', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'Playing', 'Tight', 'Strike', 'Team', 'efforts', 'end', 'corruption', 'are', 'put', 'end', 'when', 'discover', 'two', 'gangs', 'are', 'attempting', 'acquire', 'more', 'deadly', 'weaponry', 'Meanwhile', 'Dutch', 'Claudette', 'investigate', 'murders', 'four', 'men', 'Armenian', 'mob', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Safe', 'Mackey', 'Strike', 'Team', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'keep', 'being', 'linked', 'money', 'train', 'heist', 'Strike', 'Team', 'anxiously', 'streets', 'purported', 'Armenian', 'hit-man', 'first', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Shield', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '27', 'Playing', 'Tight', 'Episode', '28', 'Blood', 'Water', 'Episode', '29', 'Bottom', 'Bitch', 'Episode', '30', 'Streaks', 'Tips', 'Episode', '31', 'Mum', 'Episode', '32', 'Posse', 'Up', 'Episode', '33', 'Safe', 'Episode', '34', 'Cracking', 'Ice', 'Episode', '35', 'Slipknot', 'Episode', '36', 'What', 'Power', '37', 'Strays', 'Episode', '38', 'Riceburner', 'Episode', '39', 'Fire', 'Hole', 'Episode', '40', 'All', 'Episode', '41', 'Tilt', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

867301,AOI6Y6GO2G5E8,B0006GAO68,Daddy of 1,"[0, 1]","Ok I'm going to define what I mean by ****semi-spoiler**** before I actually say what I am.  I am not saying what happens at the end of the season, I'm not giving away any new character or if there is a departing one.  There are two scene's I have seen through the first 14 episodes that bother me.  Now with that said, I'm going to skip down a few lines and highlight those 2 scene's and state my problem with them.......****Semi-Spoiler for 2 Scene's****Episode 5 &#34;Mum&#34; has a particular scene in it that I found to be way over the top even for a late night cable network show, I'd even say it would be too much for an HBO, Cinemax, Showtime show to have.  Rape and oral sex I do not need to see on my television and I saw this, I turned off the X-Box that I was watching the show on, and I think it was at least 2 days before I put it back on to see the next episode.  Reason why I waited, I wasn't sure I wanted to continue watching a show that would depict that kind of material on the show.  Its one thing to have a show that deals with it, and you never see but you merely hear of it, like &#34;Law and Order:  Special Victim Unit&#34; where the is the premise of the show, but you never actually see the acts happening.  I find the subject of rape and abuse to be the worst of the worst in crimes, so to have that on a show I'm wanting to watch as entertainment, its hard to turn a blind eye and say, &#34;oh, its just a show.&#34; Unfortunately, because I am curious to what is happening in the main plot of the season, I decided that it couldn't get worse than that and I would just skip the rest of that episode and move on to the next.....then that brings me to:Episode 11 &#34;Strays:  This one is the other scene that bothered me.  I am an animal person.  My wife and I love animals, we have pets, and donate money to shelters and would do anything to help someone with a pet that can't afford food or treatment for their animal.  We thought we would be unable to have children, so we adopted a dog and he was our &#34;son&#34;, he went on our honeymoon with us, he was our kid.  Thankfully, God did bless us with a child and now we had 2.  Anyway, &#34;Dutch&#34; interviews a suspect of a crime, and the criminal is very messed up and tells &#34;Dutch&#34; of his childhood and what he did to a pet.....at the end of the episode, &#34;Dutch&#34; at home at night put down some food or milk and calls over a stray cat, picks it up and strangles it.  The site and sound of it was disgusting and disturbing.  I do not like movies that show killing of animals, I see no point to it what so ever.  I know that those scene's are not &#34;real&#34; and are monitored but the thought and sounds of it are bad enough for me.  I was enjoying this series, I'd like to know what happens in the next season's, but I'm struggling with if I'm going to watch the rest knowing more of this could happen.Despite those 2 things, this season has been interesting and I do want to continue to watch it to find out what happens.

They also have to deal with a new member, Tayvon who was forced onto the team by Aceveda at the end of last season.  They keep Tayvon at arm's length to prevent his discovering their misdeeds which causes tension and outright hostility between him & Shane leading to a shocking confrontation.Vic's family situation continues to crumble as Shane begins a relationship with Maura, who proves to be a lot more trouble than he bargained for.  Vic & Shane's relationship grows strained as Shane grows tired of Vic's disrespectful attitude.Aceveda continues to run The Barn following his election to a City Council seat - much to the dismay of Claudette, who'd hoped to be promoted to Captain after his departure.  Aceveda steals then implements Claudette's idea of using a decoy squad with The Strike Team and to appease her puts her in charge of both units.  The two teams compete to compile the highest number of arrests without knowing that the ultimate plan is to replace the Strike Team with the Decoy Squad.Dani & Julian struggle for different reasons - Dani, to regain her job after she takes the fall for the in-custody murder of a suspect and Julian, to regain his health & confidence following his attack by fellow officers.As the Armenian body count (without feet) begins to rise Dutch, Aceveda & Claudette begin to tie the murders to the robbery of the money train and when the Treasury Department starts tracking the missing money also, the noose begins to tighten around the Strike Team as they desperately try to misdirect the investigation.This season again was well-written and very well acted and I enjoyed how the tension ramped up during the season until the stunning season ending episode.Kudos to: Benito Martinez as Aceveda - in his determination to ""get"" Vic, he follows a lead & finds himself in a dangerous situation; Nicki Micheaux as Trish - one of the Decoy Squad cops, she is put in a compromised situation while working undercover due to an oversight on Claudette's part and again, Michael Chiklis as Vic - he struggles to keep his team together while keeping them all out of jail as well as holding onto his family.",5,The Shield - Season 3,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,2305,"['comparison', 'previous', 'seasons', 'one', 'seemingly', 'low-key', 'Strike', 'Team', 'laying', 'low', 'successful', 'heist', 'Armenian', 'money', 'train', 'also', 'have', 'deal', 'new', 'member', 'Tayvon', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'team', 'Aceveda', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'keep', 'Tayvon', 'arm', 'length', 'prevent', 'discovering', 'misdeeds', 'tension', 'outright', 'hostility', 'Shane', 'leading', 'shocking', 'confrontation.Vic', 'family', 'situation', 'crumble', 'Shane', 'relationship', 'Maura', 'who', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'trouble', 'bargained', 'Vic', 'Shane', 'relationship', 'grows', 'strained', 'Shane', 'tired', 'Vic', 'disrespectful', 'attitude.Aceveda', 'run', 'Barn', 'following', 'election', 'City', 'Council', 'seat', 'much', 'dismay', 'Claudette', 'who', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'be', 'promoted', 'Captain', 'departure', 'Aceveda', 'steals', 'then', 'Claudette', 'idea', 'using', 'decoy', 'squad', 'Strike', 'Team', 'appease', 'puts', 'charge', 'units', 'two', 'teams', 'compete', 'compile', 'highest', 'number', 'arrests', 'knowing', 'ultimate', 'plan', 'replace', 'Strike', 'Team', 'Decoy', 'Squad.Dani', 'Julian', 'struggle', 'different', 'reasons', 'Dani', 'regain', 'job', 'fall', 'in-custody', 'murder', 'suspect', 'Julian', 'regain', 'health', 'confidence', 'following', 'attack', 'fellow', 'Armenian', 'body', 'count', 'feet', 'rise', 'Dutch', 'Aceveda', 'Claudette', 'begin', 'tie', 'murders', 'robbery', 'money', 'train', 'when', 'Treasury', 'Department', 'tracking', 'missing', 'money', 'also', 'noose', 'begins', 'tighten', 'around', 'Strike', 'Team', 'desperately', 'try', 'misdirect', 'investigation.This', 'season', 'again', 'was', 'well-written', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'tension', 'ramped', 'up', 'season', 'stunning', 'season', 'ending', 'episode.Kudos', 'Benito', 'Martinez', 'Aceveda', 'determination', 'get', 'Vic', 'lead', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'Nicki', 'Micheaux', 'Trish', 'one', 'Decoy', 'Squad', 'cops', 'put', 'compromised', 'situation', 'working', 'undercover', 'due', 'oversight', 'Claudette', 'part', 'again', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Vic', 'keep', 'team', 'together', 'keeping', 'jail', 'as', 'well', 'holding', 'family']",N/A

But it is not law enforcement they want and look for. It is nothing but cleaning up the crime they do not like too much, though that makes them earn a living. Their methods are dictated by the necessary efficiency special units bring to the department.Special units are nothing but cops that use the gangsters' methods to eliminate the gangsters themselves. They do not aim at arresting them. They only arrest the small fry to catch the big ones and catch them dead rather than alive. There is no choice in that. The top gangsters might survive if they are very, very, very lucky.The second thing is that these gangster-cops are in fact under pressure from all and in all directions. Pressure to be made redundant and no longer wanted by the chief of police, the sheriff in chief or the captain of who knows what, or even the District Attorney, the one they could nickname Old Sparks or Guillotine, but his preys are the cops who are making too many waves and do not arrest enough people who will not protest or have lawyers.They are also under pressure from the gangsters they are trying to hunt and chase. These will use all the flesh and bones they can find to create that pressure: brothers, sisters, wives, kids, you name them you have them. And who cares. This society is nothing but a permanent civil war and the end of the USSR has brought quite a few thousand extremely well trained ex-KGB officers turned gangsters and these do not hesitate at pressing the trigger or just getting rid of you if you are in  their way. That's their way of dealing with obstacles: blow them up with dynamite first and then ask for their identity.They are also under pressure from their ex-wives, future wives, their future wives' mothers, their kids, autistic or not, the head shrinks of their children, their wives' boyfriends and their girlfriends' husbands, from the prostitutes on the sidewalk or the pimps in the bars, not to speak of their parents and their best friends, their neighbors and their children's teachers. Too bad boys, to be a cop is to be the focus of attention, and if you are girls, it is then even worse since you will have to accept the services the trendy nice boys in the street will offer you on a platter.This series is thus not particularly clear on the subtleties of the crimes or the crime scenes. In fact there is no crime scene, no scientific police, no lawyers, no forensics, no standard procedure, no miranda whatever it may be. There is only violence, blood, bullets and victims.

Shawn Ryan, the creator, mentions in one of the DVD commentaries that wide screen would make the show look more like film and less like television, and as such feels it would distance the viewer from action.  You know, we might notice how dead brilliant the camera work on the show is, instead of just being swept along by the story.

The 3rd season is easily the most intense. This show is the epitome when it comes to good cop drama.Dominant storylines of this season:1.Aceveda, Dutch, and the Armenians are all looking for the men who knocked off the money train. The Armenians are taking no prisoners when it comes to finding information. An Armenian psycho from the first season returns to help in the search.2.Aceveda is on his way up to city council and Claudette is replacing him. This season covers the transition and the power struggle between Claudette and Aceveda as they both struggle to run the barn.3.Aceveda has a truly shocking experience when he is taken prisoner by a gang member. Much of the season deals with him tracking this gang member down. Will he seek personal revenge or will he bring the man to legal justice? This storyline is intense and incredible.4.Dutch questions a serial killer who gives him great insight into life, death, and killing. Dutch becomes very curious about taking life. This gets a little disturbing and pretty shocking.5.A new team is brought into the barn and rumors are circulating that they could replace the Strike team. This leads to fierce competition between Vic's team and the newbies.6.Shane's fear of Tayvon culminates to one of the most shocking moments in the show's history.7.The Strike Team struggles to maintain and not break down as the pressure comes down on them. Vic finds out that some of the money taken in the 2nd season may be marked by the Feds. Things get worse when some of their money goes missing and no one is willing to fess up to taking it.Overall this show keeps getting better and better. It deserved to win Best drama and best actor Emmy's and Golden Globes in its first season. Michael Chicklis is amazing and the cast overall is just incredible. CCH Pounder really needs to be nominated for best actress because she delivers some of the best acting seen on tv today. Don't jump right into this season. That would be a big mistake. Watch all the seasons in order and you will not be dissapointed in anyway. Everyone I've shown this show to has loved it. It's unbelievable how good it is.

867352,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B0006GAO68,Michael Crane,"[49, 50]","""The Shield"" seems to up it a notch with every season.  I remember watching the very first season and thinking to myself that there was no way this show could get any darker, more intense or more outrageous.  I was proven wrong when I saw the second season, but yet again I made the wrong assumption and thinking there was no way in the world that the next season would be more devastating and brutal.After seeing Season 3, I have finally learned my lesson and will no longer make that silly assumption.  This is because ""The Shield: Season 3"" takes you even further down the rabbit hole that is this amazingly dark and take-no-prisoners cop drama that pretty much breaks all of the rules.  You are given some deeply flawed characters... and yet, we still want to learn more about them and even care what happens to them.After successfully robbing the money train, the heat is on the Strike Team more than ever.  Vic needs to keep his team in line until the dust settles, but that proves to be an impossible task as emotions and paranoia run high among the other participants.  Captain Aceveda is still trying to maintain his political career while taking care of The Barn, but something horrific will happen to him that will leave him never being the same again.  Claudette is still striving for the position of the ""top dog"" at The Barn and doesn't make things easier for Vic when she decides to include a Decoy Squad, while keeping a close eye on Vic and his team.  Still, Vic has other problems to deal with, and I'm not even talking about his family issues.  The Strike Team is in constant danger of being the latest victims of the Armenian Mob, who is willing to kill anyone involved with the whole money train robbery.  This is only a small part of the fun that lurks in this explosive third season.The show is still extremely dark and brutal at times, but it still gets in a lot of the ironic humor in it as well.  Fans of the first two seasons will most likely enjoy this new season, as each episode is engaging and addicting.  The great writing and execution is still there and by the time you finish these 15 episodes, you'll want more.  Michael Chiklis does an excellent job of playing ""Vic,"" and even though there are times you really hate him, there are also times where you cannot help but root for him.This show is not for those who get offended easily or are extremely sensitive.  Just like the other two seasons, these guys pretty much get away with ANYTHING (the only exception I've seen is the usage of the F-word).  This is definitely something you'd think you would catch on HBO.  There's a lot of violence, language, disturbing situations and content, and there is a pretty horrible rape scene... but it's not what you would think.  Anyways, just be cautious.  If you can handle the first two seasons, then you shouldn't have too many problems dealing with Season 3.  Extras included are commentary on selected episodes, deleted scenes and a making-of documentary.""The Shield: Season 3"" delivers the goods when it comes to addicting and mesmerizing TV.  All of the episodes are highly entertaining and you will find yourself having a hard time putting the DVDs away.  Once you start, it is VERY hard to stop watching.  If you haven't seen the other seasons, then I'd recommend checking those out first, although it is possible to get the gist of what's going on without doing so.  ""The Shield"" has definitely kept its edge, and Season 3 proves that big time. -Michael Crane",5,"""Looks like you're going to die a bad speller...""",1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,3496,"['Shield', 'up', 'notch', 'season', 'remember', 'watching', 'very', 'first', 'season', 'thinking', 'myself', 'was', 'way', 'show', 'could', 'get', 'darker', 'more', 'intense', 'more', 'outrageous', 'was', 'proven', 'wrong', 'when', 'saw', 'second', 'season', 'yet', 'again', 'made', 'wrong', 'assumption', 'thinking', 'there', 'was', 'way', 'world', 'next', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'devastating', 'brutal.After', 'seeing', 'Season', '3', 'have', 'finally', 'learned', 'lesson', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'make', 'silly', 'assumption', 'Shield', 'Season', '3', 'even', 'further', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'amazingly', 'dark', 'take-no-prisoners', 'cop', 'drama', 'pretty', 'much', 'rules', 'are', 'given', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'characters', 'yet', 'still', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'even', 'care', 'what', 'them.After', 'successfully', 'robbing', 'money', 'train', 'heat', 'Strike', 'Team', 'more', 'ever', 'Vic', 'keep', 'team', 'line', 'dust', 'settles', 'be', 'impossible', 'task', 'emotions', 'paranoia', 'run', 'high', 'other', 'participants', 'Captain', 'Aceveda', 'still', 'trying', 'maintain', 'political', 'career', 'taking', 'care', 'Barn', 'something', 'horrific', 'will', 'happen', 'will', 'leave', 'never', 'being', 'same', 'again', 'Claudette', 'still', 'striving', 'position', 'top', 'dog', 'Barn', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'Vic', 'when', 'include', 'Decoy', 'Squad', 'keeping', 'close', 'eye', 'Vic', 'team', 'Still', 'Vic', 'other', 'problems', 'deal', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'talking', 'family', 'issues', 'Strike', 'Team', 'constant', 'danger', 'being', 'latest', 'victims', 'Armenian', 'Mob', 'who', 'willing', 'kill', 'anyone', 'involved', 'whole', 'money', 'train', 'robbery', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'fun', 'explosive', 'third', 'season.The', 'show', 'still', 'extremely', 'dark', 'brutal', 'times', 'still', 'lot', 'ironic', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'Fans', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'new', 'season', 'episode', 'engaging', 'addicting', 'great', 'writing', 'execution', 'still', 'time', 'finish', '15', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'want', 'more', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'Vic', 'even', 'are', 'times', 'really', 'hate', 'are', 'also', 'times', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'root', 'him.This', 'show', 'not', 'who', 'get', 'offended', 'easily', 'are', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'Just', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'guys', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'away', 'ANYTHING', 'only', 'exception', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'usage', 'F-word', 'definitely', 'something', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'catch', 'HBO', 'lot', 'violence', 'language', 'disturbing', 'situations', 'content', 'pretty', 'horrible', 'rape', 'scene', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'Anyways', 'just', 'be', 'cautious', 'can', 'handle', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'dealing', 'Season', '3', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'commentary', 'selected', 'episodes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'Shield', 'Season', '3', 'delivers', 'goods', 'when', 'addicting', 'mesmerizing', 'TV', 'episodes', 'are', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'will', 'find', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'putting', 'DVDs', 'away', 'Once', 'start', 'VERY', 'hard', 'stop', 'watching', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'seasons', 'then', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'checking', 'first', 'possible', 'get', 'gist', 'what', 'going', 'doing', 'so', 'Shield', 'definitely', 'kept', 'edge', 'Season', '3', 'proves', 'big', 'time', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A
867353,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0006GAO68,Mitch Weaver,"[7, 10]","I have been a die hard fan of The Shield since the very first episode. With all of the different crime shows on television, I have always thought of The Shield as the best one out there, simply because it is a cop show with actual continuity and not a case by case format. The acting and writing on The Shield is top notch, and it offers a very controversial look at the cops of Los Angeles. The first two seasons of The Shield were both amazing and two of the best seasons that I have ever seen from any show period. Unfortunately, the third season of The Shield was like many shows last year - 24, Alias, etc.. It was just not as good as the previous seasons before it.One of the things that makes The Shield such a good show is that even though the main characters are on the right side of the law, they often act even worse than the criminals at times. They do what they want, when they want to do it. Due to the events of season two regarding the money train, the Strike Team scale back their actions and play it safe. We did not get to see the same type of ""take no prisoners"" attitude from the Strike Team, which really hurt the season. The other downside, is that the other side of the show that involves Dutch and Claudette taking down criminals, is spent chasing after a sexual predator for most of the season. Now despite the fantastic development in the storyline and the great build up to the finish, the closing of the case is kind of anti-climactic. On the bright side however, the reason this season still rates a solid four stars, is because of the brilliant development of Captain David Aceveda. Aceveda has to go through a lot this season, and there is one event in particular that deals with him being sexually assaulted on the job. It is quite disturbing, and it weighs on him throughout the whole season. My other favorite thing about the third season besides the direction they went with Aceveda, was the cliffhanger left in the season three finale. It really makes you want to tune in for the fourth season because the fate of the Strike Team is left up in the air.When shows like The Shield, do such a good job with their first seasons, and then somehow manage to do an even better with season number two, you get spoiled and expect good things from season three.

As you have come to expect, everything is related, and the season finale is wholly satisfying, tying up most threads, yet leaving a gaping vacuum of a cliffhanger.The shows that come in the middle of the season, the best of the year, are also amongst the best ever seen on 'The Shield'.One of those smaller arcs, the ""cuddler rapist"", is one of the best-handled stories of the series. The Dutch character shows more of his fangs here. He is a fascinating misfit, right in the center of the action.Another arc, involving Captain Aceveda, is also harrowing, and shows that this show goes where no other cop show even dares.CCH Pounder, again, is a marvel, and there is absolutely nothing more that can be said about the amazing Michael Chiklis. He has created a character for the ages.The Strike Team members get some development, although the fourth member, Ronnie, is still the least defined. Lem, with his perpetual, dyspeptic wince, and Shane, with his unhinged glare, really come into their own...The arc involving Vic's family is constantly surprising, and his older daughter (played by Chiklis' real daughter) has several nice turns...his estranged wife, played by the creator's (Shawn Ryan) wife remains one of the most true-to-life wife portrayals on TV.There are several other surprising plot twists during the season that I wouldn't dream of spoiling; just be happy you haven't seen this season yet.You have another fifteen hours of extraordinary television ahead of you...",4,Just misses the highs of the past seasons...still extraordinary.,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,1859,"['still', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'TV', 'Shield', 'third', 'season', 'centers', 'more', 'turmoil', 'Barn', 'precinct', 'station', 'Farmington', 'volatile', 'fictional', 'section', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'serve', '.The', 'money', 'train', 'plot', 'thread', 'season', 'two', 'prominent', 'secondary', 'issue', 'majority', 'season', 'here', 'other', 'smaller', 'arcs', 'rise', 'top', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'everything', 'related', 'season', 'finale', 'wholly', 'satisfying', 'tying', 'up', 'most', 'threads', 'yet', 'leaving', 'gaping', 'vacuum', 'cliffhanger.The', 'come', 'middle', 'season', 'best', 'year', 'are', 'also', 'best', 'ever', 'seen', ""'The"", ""Shield'.One"", 'smaller', 'arcs', 'cuddler', 'rapist', 'one', 'best-handled', 'stories', 'series', 'Dutch', 'character', 'more', 'fangs', 'here', 'fascinating', 'misfit', 'right', 'center', 'action.Another', 'arc', 'involving', 'Captain', 'Aceveda', 'also', 'harrowing', 'show', 'where', 'other', 'cop', 'show', 'even', 'dares.CCH', 'Pounder', 'again', 'marvel', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'amazing', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'created', 'character', 'ages.The', 'Strike', 'Team', 'members', 'get', 'development', 'fourth', 'member', 'Ronnie', 'still', 'least', 'defined', 'Lem', 'perpetual', 'dyspeptic', 'wince', 'Shane', 'unhinged', 'glare', 'really', 'come', 'own', 'arc', 'involving', 'Vic', 'family', 'constantly', 'surprising', 'older', 'daughter', 'played', 'Chiklis', 'real', 'daughter', 'several', 'nice', 'turns', 'estranged', 'wife', 'played', 'creator', 'Shawn', 'Ryan', 'wife', 'one', 'most', 'true-to-life', 'wife', 'portrayals', 'TV.There', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'season', 'would', ""n't"", 'dream', 'spoiling', 'just', 'be', 'happy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'season', 'yet.You', 'have', 'fifteen', 'hours', 'extraordinary', 'television', 'ahead']",N/A

Now, Vic and co. have to keep their actions on the downlow, as they get a new member and Acevedo (Benito Martinez) struggles to maintain control over the precinct as Claudette (CCH Pounder) prepares for her new role.  The precinct also tracks down a sexual predator for a majority of the season, which at times seems contrived and written to fill in time at some spots.  With that fact in tow, it's practically unanimous among fans of the show that the thrid season of the Shield is a step down from the excellent and groundbreaking previous two seasons, but this is still the best drama on basic cable.  By the time that someone's conscience catches up with them by the last couple episodes, the events that unfold in the season finale find Vic and co. sitting on a powder keg that will leave you salivating for the upcoming fourth season.

Varine ""Make beats, not war, haha...""","[2, 2]","Much of what I'd read about ""The Shield"" Season 3 was that it was the 'let-down' season.I found that to be a bit off-base.Season 3 is just as entertaining as the first and second runs, if not more. This is a little generalistic, but to say that everyone hates and distrusts everyone else is not really that far off.The Strike Team members are eyeing one another over the safety of their money train haul, and ESPECIALLY after $7,000 disappears and no one owns up to it. Wyms no longer trusts Aceveda after he decides to stay on ""a little longer"" at The Barn. Officer Danny Sofer has her job back, but only in return for keeping Aceveda in the loop about ""anyone crossing the line around here,"" and when Julien accompanies Mackey on a ""deep blue run"" to protect another cop, tension between she and Julien gets ratcheted up.Add to that Wyms' suggestion of bringing in a Decoy Squad to ""work with"" (read: compete with) the Strike Team, and you have another excellent 14 hours or so of television to watch.Of course, there's the usual sex-violence-cussing that we're all used to, and plenty of bad guys to take down.I think people's misgivings about Season 3 stem from its focus on action INSIDE The Barn, rather than outside. There isn't a major villain this time around, unless you count the Armenian mobster who's running around hacking people's feet off in his search to uncover who took their cash stash, and while gangsta-rapper (or is it now rapping-gangsta?) Kern Little shows up a bit, he doesn't play a huge role.The beauty of Season 3 is watching the million ways that the Strike Team could be caught, and seeing them wriggle out of each and every one, including the height of the conflict between Shane and new Strike Teamer, Tavon, that ends with... well, let's just say plenty of blood is spilled.I also really like the addition of Mara, Shane's girlfriend, as an outside element that endangers the Strike Team. With Mackey's ex-wife, even through the divorce, she doesn't really affect the Strike Team, through Mackey or otherwise, but the addition of a meddling girlfriend (who rightly sees Vic as a bit of an a**hole) allows you to see the dynamic between Mackey and Shane that Mara puts into perfect focus: ""If you two are brothers, how come he's always treating you like the little brother?""To see these guys bend over backward for one another for two seasons, and then start turning on one another is riveting TV.If you loved Season 1 and wanted to marry Season 2, you'll be asking for a menage a trois with Season 3, my friend.",4,"THIS is supposed to be the ""letdown"" season?!?",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,2545,"['Much', 'what', ""'d"", 'read', 'Shield', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'was', ""'let-down"", 'season.I', 'found', 'be', 'bit', 'off-base.Season', '3', 'just', 'as', 'entertaining', 'first', 'second', 'runs', 'not', 'more', 'little', 'generalistic', 'say', 'everyone', 'hates', 'distrusts', 'everyone', 'else', 'not', 'really', 'far', 'Strike', 'Team', 'members', 'are', 'eyeing', 'one', 'safety', 'money', 'train', 'haul', 'ESPECIALLY', '7,000', 'disappears', 'one', 'Wyms', 'no', 'longer', 'Aceveda', 'stay', 'little', 'longer', 'Barn', 'Officer', 'Danny', 'Sofer', 'job', 'back', 'only', 'return', 'keeping', 'Aceveda', 'loop', 'anyone', 'crossing', 'line', 'here', 'when', 'Julien', 'Mackey', 'deep', 'blue', 'run', 'protect', 'cop', 'tension', 'Julien', 'ratcheted', 'up.Add', 'Wyms', 'suggestion', 'bringing', 'Decoy', 'Squad', 'work', 'read', 'compete', 'Strike', 'Team', 'have', 'excellent', '14', 'hours', 'so', 'television', 'watch.Of', 'course', 'usual', 'sex-violence-cussing', ""'re"", 'used', 'plenty', 'bad', 'guys', 'take', 'down.I', 'think', 'people', 'misgivings', 'Season', '3', 'stem', 'focus', 'action', 'Barn', 'rather', 'outside', ""n't"", 'major', 'villain', 'time', 'around', 'count', 'Armenian', 'mobster', 'who', 'running', 'around', 'hacking', 'people', 'feet', 'search', 'uncover', 'who', 'took', 'cash', 'stash', 'gangsta-rapper', 'now', 'rapping-gangsta', 'Kern', 'Little', 'up', 'bit', ""n't"", 'play', 'huge', 'role.The', 'beauty', 'Season', '3', 'watching', 'million', 'ways', 'Strike', 'Team', 'could', 'be', 'caught', 'seeing', 'wriggle', 'one', 'including', 'height', 'conflict', 'Shane', 'new', 'Strike', 'Teamer', 'Tavon', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'plenty', 'blood', 'spilled.I', 'also', 'really', 'addition', 'Mara', 'Shane', 'girlfriend', 'outside', 'element', 'Strike', 'Team', 'Mackey', 'ex-wife', 'even', 'divorce', ""n't"", 'really', 'affect', 'Strike', 'Team', 'Mackey', 'otherwise', 'addition', 'meddling', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'rightly', 'Vic', 'bit', 'a**hole', 'see', 'dynamic', 'Mackey', 'Shane', 'Mara', 'perfect', 'focus', 'two', 'are', 'brothers', 'how', 'come', 'always', 'treating', 'little', 'brother', 'see', 'guys', 'bend', 'over', 'backward', 'one', 'two', 'seasons', 'then', 'start', 'turning', 'one', 'riveting', 'TV.If', 'loved', 'Season', '1', 'wanted', 'marry', 'Season', '2', ""'ll"", 'be', 'asking', 'menage', 'trois', 'Season', '3', 'friend']",N/A

867379,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0006GAO68,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[35, 37]","As the third season of The Shield unfolds Mackey's (Michael Chiklis) family falls apart and his team continues to face pressure regarding the stolen drug money earmarked for their ""retirement"" fund. Clashes abound between teammates, lovers and family members making tackling criminals even more complex than ususal. The ""Armenian money train"" case continues to worry the team forcing Lemon (Kenneth Johnson) to solve their problem and, in the process, creating more problems for the strike team. More bodies show up with their feet missing as the bad guys get closer to the discovering who took their money.  Meanwhile Wyms (CCH Pounder) works undercover to bust a child porn film ring.The Shield continues to be one of the best written, directed and acted series on basic cable. The series' ultra realistic look with the use of handheld cameras, grainy film stock and gritty locations continues to create an environment full of powerful drama. Usually a series will begin to drop in quality over the course of its run but the fact that the series runs only fifteen episodes helps keep the writing and directing quality high. There's also a number of high profile guest star turns particularly in the David Mamet directed episode where Mamet's ""regulars"" Rebecca Pidgeon and Clark Gregg appear turning in outstanding performances. While the Mamet episode is definitely good it's not the best episode from the third season and that's saying quite a bit about this terrific show.In addition to a number of deleted scenes with optional commentary we also get a terrific documentary on the third season. Breaking Episode #315 gives us a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the production and collaborative method of writing the series. To access the documentary you have to select the episode On Tilt and select Special Features which is a bit odd for a boxed set. We're taken through all parts of the process for an episode of the series from pitching ideas for the multiple storylines to the actual shooting on location and the set. On the production side of things we see the difficulty in creating a stunt involving a wolf for a particular sequence.  The 60 minute documentary spends the bulk of its time in the writer's room watching them come up with the various ideas that will might show up in a particular episode. Additionally, there's a preview of what's to come with Glenn Close playing Det. Ronnie Gardocki during the fourth season of the series. You do have the option of playing the episode without the recap of each episode which is a nice touch.The commentary tracks are all recorded with various cast and crew members together. It works much better doing it this way as the banter and synergy created by the ""team"" creates a much more interesting commentary track. There's few performers, writers or directors that can provide a commentary track that will keep your interest beyond 10 minutes so this team approach will keep viewers much more involved with interesting behind-the-scenes observations about performances, the writing and how it changes from page to screen and the production touches that continues to keep this show cutting edge.Once again Fox comes up with a winner with The Shield. 15 high quality episodes with strong performances, a great documentary on the creation of an episode and deleted scenes with optional commentaries makes this one of the best values out there. We also get deleted scenes with optional commentary. The packaging is nicely done with each disc housed in a Thinpak DVD case.

867380,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0006GAO68,Wheelchair Assassin,"[2, 2]","While a great many shows start getting low on good ideas around their third season (if not sooner), that certainly wasn't a problem with The Shield.  In fact, groundbreaking though the show's first season was, season two proved that it was just getting started, and there was no drop in quality in this third season either.  Season three of The Shield may not have been quite as kinetic as the first two, but the basic formula remained unhchanged.  The show's unique look and feel, characterized by frenetic direction and editing and blunt, unflinching depictions of violence remained intact, but this time around The Shield was even darker, more harrowing, and more committed to plumbing the depths of the human psyche.  The Shield's plotting has long been notable for its blink-and-you're-lost complexity, and things only continue to get more complicated in the barn as characters struggle through all kinds of personal and professional turmoil.Season two's action centered largely around the Strike Team's plans to rip off a convoy of Armenian mob money, and Seaon Three picks up that plot thread and runs with it all the way to its characteristically messy resolution in the final two episodes.  The Strike Team has gotten away with $4 million worth of dirty cash, but it quickly becomes apparent that stealing the money was the easiest part.  As season three opens, vicious, Jesus-like Armenian mob boss Margos Dizarian (spelling may be off there) is creating a bloody trail around Farmington, leaving the dead, footless bodies of several of his underlings lying around for the cops to find as he tries to recover his ill-gotten loot.  It's not long before Dutch, Aceveda, and the Treasury Department all wind up on the team's tail, forcing Vic, Shane, Lem, and Ronny to tread extremely carefully with their illicit fortune.  At the same time, the Strike Team gets some competition when Aceveda brings in a decoy squad from a neighboring precinct and a not-so-friendly rivalry kicks in (however, the resolution of the two teams' first case together is brutally hilarious).  For their part, the members of the decoy squad are more than just plot devices, as a couple members become memorable and convincing characters themselves, with Nicki Micheaux deserving special props for her incredible performance as Trish (the episode where Trish goes undercover with a street gang and nearly gets killed doing it is easily one of the show's strongest, thanks in no small part to her work).Largely owing to the Strike Team's financial dilemma, season three is even more of a triumph of pressure-cooker atmosphere than the first two, steadily building tension as it rockets toward the culmination of several of its most nagging conflicts.  We get a good example of this tension early on, as the rivalry between Shane and Tavon builds throughout the first quarter of the season, culminating in their knock-down-drag-out brawl at Shane's apartment.  And while the characters on the show don't evolve per se, we do get to see some new sides of them here in response to the season's traumatic events: Aceveda's air of iron-fisted authority is threatened by his, er, emasculation at the hands of a gap-toothed gang member; Claudette's near-perfect reputation takes a similar hit when a screwup in an undercover sting operation nearly proves deadly; Dutch is forced to question his understanding of the criminal mind by his meeting with the cuddler rapist; and even the previously inconsequential Lemonhead becomes a somewhat compelling character as his longstanding objections to the money-train scheme intensify over the course of these episodes.All in all, I found season three to be every bit the equal of the first two seasons, as it contains all of the gritty, low-budget intensity that makes The Shield one of the most distinctive shows (actually, probably one of the few distinctive shows) on TV right now.  The emergence of reality TV as a viable force may have been the most dramatic trend in television so far this decade, but The Shield still manages to feel less contrived and more authentic than any reality show I've watched (admittedly, not many).  Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but The Shield has proven to be all but inimitable, practically forcing you to watch every episode with eyes glued to the screen.
