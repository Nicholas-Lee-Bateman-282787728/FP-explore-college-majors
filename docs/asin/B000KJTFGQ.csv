The acting was weak and the fight and kill scenes were some of the worst ive seen in cinema history. I wanted to shut it off half way thru but I stuck thru to the end. Its ok to watch one as one viewer pointed out but nothing worth owning. This would be a perfect movie to remake.",2,Wasted Potential,1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,351,"['Mailman', 'had', 'perfect', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'pun', 'intended', 'acting', 'was', 'weak', 'fight', 'kill', 'scenes', 'were', 'worst', 'ive', 'seen', 'cinema', 'history', 'wanted', 'shut', 'off', 'half', 'way', 'stuck', 'thru', 'end', 'ok', 'watch', 'one', 'one', 'viewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'nothing', 'worth', 'owning', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'movie', 'remake']",N/A
1034594,AV4SW3GWVVHKY,B000KJTFGQ,Bonnie1956,"[13, 14]","Lots of nudity and some gore but not really scary or suspenseful like Halloween or some other movies of that genre..no apparent tongue in cheek humor either.  The cover art is misleading because the so-called  mailman works for a non-existent private delivery service and isn't a real US govm't mailman...that would be scary and what motivated me to rent the movie. There are no closed captions or extras and the film has the look and sound of a cheaply made TV movie; the expensive purchase price is puzzling.  For real scary suspense and the depiction of a psychopathic USPS mailman, see The Minus Man, a truly horrific (and sardonic) story.  USPS cooperated with the filming so the post office scenes and workings are realistic and one can better believe the evil depicted.",1,"OK To Rent, Only Worth One Viewing",1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,776,"['Lots', 'nudity', 'gore', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'Halloween', 'other', 'movies', 'genre..no', 'apparent', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'humor', 'cover', 'art', 'misleading', 'so-called', 'mailman', 'non-existent', 'private', 'delivery', 'service', ""n't"", 'real', 'US', ""govm't"", 'mailman', 'would', 'be', 'scary', 'what', 'motivated', 'rent', 'movie', 'are', 'closed', 'captions', 'extras', 'film', 'look', 'sound', 'cheaply', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'expensive', 'purchase', 'price', 'puzzling', 'real', 'scary', 'suspense', 'depiction', 'psychopathic', 'USPS', 'mailman', 'see', 'Minus', 'Man', 'truly', 'horrific', 'sardonic', 'story', 'USPS', 'cooperated', 'filming', 'post', 'office', 'scenes', 'workings', 'are', 'realistic', 'one', 'can', 'better', 'believe', 'evil', 'depicted']",N/A

The movie is like one of those that appear to be home made. There is really no plot to the movie. The acting is so bad. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you are thinking of purchasing this please think again. You would be very disappointed in it. I did not even watch the whole thing because it was that cheesy. Ok the mailman is going around killing people but there is no storyline to it. I will put it this way, if there was such a thing as not giving a movie any stars at all I would rate this one with none.",1,"Cheesy, Horrible, Etc...
