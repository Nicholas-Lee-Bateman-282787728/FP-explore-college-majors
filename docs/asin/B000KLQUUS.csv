Cocaine Cowboys explores not only drug traffickers and the cocaine trade, but also the rise of a great American city. Florida in the seventies was ""wide open,"" and, as always, the government was several steps behind the criminals. The venture that Mr. Roberts had with Mr. Munday flying ""product"" in and out of Columbia was pretty fascinating as were the links with the Ochoa Cartel. The interviews are excellent and these fellows, along with hitman Rivi Ayala, tell us just about everything we need to know about a period in Miami's history when it was wilder than the wild west. Godmother Griselda Blanco was a fascinating, although detestable, character, and one I had never heard of before seeing the documentary. Were it not for drug cash would Miami be what it is today?

People forget how violent a place was Miami back then. Columbian drug traffickers were slaughtering each other every day. The cops were outmanned and outgunned. No one was safe. This reloaded version of an earlier film adds more footage, better titles and music, and endings to the sagas of some of the players seen here, such as Griselda Blanco, the drug queen responsible for so many murders. She was assassinated in Colombia a few years ago. The main drug trafficker in the film, Jon Roberts, died of cancer. The hitman, Rivi Ayala, is actually trying for an early prison release, though he was tied to dozens of murders. The 1980s TV news footage alone is a hoot to watch.

My ""movies to watch"" list is so long I just kind of added it to the list and didn't worry too much about it. I decided to sit down and watch it last night and WOW! I am sorry I didn't watch it sooner. This is an explosive, exciting story of real-life drug smuggling, murders, and high living in Miami in the 80s. One thing I loved about this documentary was that there was no narrator. So many documentaries get bogged down because the narrator just drones on and on, and won't get out of the story's way. In this documentary, the directors let the subjects tell the story and it is way more authentic and entertaining that way. I also really liked the innovative visuals, using still photographs and cutouts of photographs to illustrate things.This documentary makes an interesting point - as bloody and destructive as the Miami drug wars were, they did result in the construction of modern Miami. Although one person in the documentary says ""too many people died, it wasn't worth it"" you do have to wonder where Miami would be today without the massive cash influx provided by illegal drug smuggling in the 1980s. As someone who believes drug legalization (at the very least, for marijuana and ""softer"" drugs) should be more seriously considered, I thought the point was interesting and well-made. Think how much money is generated by the drug trade each year; then think about what that money could do if it were harnessed and controlled by the government, who would also have more power to regulate drug violence.This is an awesome documentary even if you are the type who hates documentaries.

1035160,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000KLQUUS,Linda Linguvic,"[0, 0]","This 2006 documentary about the rise and fall of the cocaine trade in Miami in the 1970s and 1980s is so fast-paced and intriguing that I stayed glued to the screen for the full two hours.  It is the story of how the city of Miami changed from a sleepy vacation spot into the hub of the international cocaine trade in just a few short years.Newsreels from the time bring back the styles and habits of the 1970s.  Interviews with real-life criminals who have served or are still serving time in prison brings the stories to a personal level.  There is money - millions of dollars in cash.  There are drugs - hundreds of tons of cocaine and marijuana.  There are clever schemes to hide it all.  And lots of ways to spend the money.The participants who are interviewed are all nostalgic.  They explain how it all worked - how the drugs were shipped, how they were stored, and how it was distributed.  Their lifestyles were opulent.  It was exciting and fun.  The social effect on Miami was to bring prosperity to the car dealers and jewelry stores.  It was a kaleidoscopic world and a party that seemed that it would never end.And then there was the violence.  We see a newsreel of a hit in a shopping center.  We hear an interview with a man now in prison who murdered a dozen people.  Often, even children were not spared.  There were Columbians, Cubans and Panamanians involved.  The worst was a woman who ran the whole business who is rumored to have had more than 200 people killed.Eventually, the gangs were disabled, the perpetrators were sent to prison and the whole cocaine traffic ended.  Miami seemed to be destroyed.  But then it came back.The best part of this film is that it was all real and the filmmaker presented it well  It was all done rapid-fire.  There was not a dull moment.

1035161,A654LRSLYDB93,B000KLQUUS,Link Hogthrob,"[3, 3]","I lived in Freeport, Bahamas from 1980-1983. All television and radio was out of Miami and West Palm Beach, and Miami was only 30 minutes away on a 747. I often attempt to describe what it was like there to friends: the Haitian boat people, the Liberty City riots, the Mariel boat lift and the Colombian drug trade. But my anecdotes fall short of the mark. Prior to seeing ""Cocaine Cowboys"", the best I could do was tell them ""watch 'Scarface'...with the exception of the final scene over-the-top hokey shootout, it was dead on."" ""Cocaine Cowboys"" captures the true picture of the era there.Daily you would wake up, turn on the radio and get the body count: 3 men found in the trunk of a burning car; or a headless corpse found floating in a canal; or 4 men killed in a parking lot shootout, 2 civilians wounded in the crossfire. This was followed by an ad for Lanson's, a high end men's clothier, advertising a bullet proof men's dinner jacket, ""What the best dressed Miamian is wearing."" Driving down the Dixie Hwy. in Miami, you see a bus stop bench with an ad on the back: ""Protectar usted y su familia"" punctuated with images of an automatic pistol and a machine gun and an address on Flagler St. where you can pick yours up.The movie speaks for itself just like ""Scarface"". I have no doubt the individual narratives are accurate and non-hyperbolic. The movie does credit the cocaine ""business"" with cash infusion into the area and the resulting uplift of the overall economy. However, it omits the psychological impact on ordinary citizens, who saw little of the cocaine bucks: fear of getting caught in a crossfire and the depression of living in a combat zone.Also omitted from the storyline were some of the Colombian weapons innovations: the Colombians came up with armor piercing bullets and laser sighting long before the cops had them. Then the feds showed up en mass and the tide turned.I gave the movie a ""5"" even though it was a documentary and had no plot, no real acting.

Actual accounts from former smugglers, Law Enforcement and the people they were involved with really bring home on what it was like in Florida in the 80s. It does seem to glorify these sharp minded individuals who imported more dope, and made more money than i can possibly fathom. The tale always goes from ""We were on top of the world"" to ""Where did all the Money go?""  I always like to think that somewhere, someone was holding onto a large trash bag full of money for these guys like Mikey Monday, and Jon Roberts.  Roberts comes off in my opin as genuinely likeable in this recout as does Monday, the pilot, smuggler who just seemed interested in the money.Roberts who just lost a long battle with cancer in 2011.The smuggler's tale i feel is the best shown while the tale of hitman, Jorge ""Rivi"" Ayala comes off as ""Look how bad I am"" but then he's rotting in jail so i guess if it were me, I would do the same and save my rep.The style of the docu is excellent and keeps me watching every time i watch it.

1035171,A1YRYWY01L9BZ6,B000KLQUUS,SORE EYES,"[14, 17]","A Real LifeWeeds - Season One,Weeds - Season Two,Weeds - Season ThreeA documentary that details the inception of the cocaine drug trade in America from the early 1970's when Columbian dealers dropped a few ""suprise"" kilos in bags of marijuana which was easily smuggled in via boats to the Reagan Era which spent millions ""controlling"" the drug trade in South Florida. ""Cocaine Cowboys"" presents an interesting perspective on the economy of the 1970's and what kept Miami afloat.  Director Billy Corben tells the story of a Miami skyline built not of bricks and steel, but bricks of cocaine via interviews with some interesting smugglers, assasins, dealers, Ford models, and newscasters.According to the film, in the 1970's marijuana was easily smuggled into South Florida. People openly off-loaded bales of marijuana from sail boats on public docks without interference. According to dealers in the film, in the 1970's cocaine was only used by medical professionals who could afford the several hundred dollars a gram price tag. Eventually the Columbian cartels found smugglers willing to import the drug and used Cuban distributors which made the drug readily available for everyone. The drug was first used by low-lifes-Castro refugees set free after he opened his prisons-and worked it's way up the ladder to become a party drug for all echelons of society. While the rest of the country struggled with 18 percent rates of inflation and a crashing economy, the Federal Reserve in Miami had so many deposits they had to stay open 24 hours a day. At one point the film says that federal investigators estimate one bank should have taken in deposits of around 2 million a year but was actually taking in 12 million. And that was just one bank. Hundreds opened their doors to launder money for the Columbian cartels. With the cocaine economy came Mercedes dealerships, a run-up in housing costs, luxury jewelery dealers. The Mercedes dealership in South Beach had a three month waiting list while the rest of the country was struggling to save for a Honda Civic and the gas that went in it.It's never stated, but it sounds like the cocaine economy kept the whole country afloat for a while. The situation continued for about ten years until so much cocaine was being imported that the price dropped, violence skyrocketed, and the government finally decided to start busting people-not coincidentally at a time when the economy had recovered. Most of the people interviewed for this film were or are in jail. But many people in legitimate businesses that benefited from the free flowing cash from the cartels, used their new found wealth to build the Miami skyline. A doctor who is interviewed for the film said that at one point he was driving to work and counted more than 30 skyscrapers going up in the Miami skyline-all from the profits of drug money.Some of this documentary will be familar. There have been enough films and sitcoms about cocaine in Miami that most of us know the tales. However, the positive economic impacts of cocaine were totally unknown to me. It's amazing and somewhat shocking. The vintage news footage and interviews make this documentary really interesting and keep the essential message from becoming a boring classroom lecture from the Federal Reserve chairman. All in all, a unique perspective and a pretty good yarn told by interesting raconteurs.",4,You'll Never Look At The Miami Skyline In the Same Way Again,1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,3380,"['Real', 'LifeWeeds', 'Season', 'One', 'Weeds', 'Season', 'Two', 'Weeds', 'Season', 'ThreeA', 'documentary', 'details', 'inception', 'cocaine', 'drug', 'trade', 'America', 'early', '1970', 'when', 'Columbian', 'dealers', 'dropped', 'few', 'suprise', 'kilos', 'bags', 'marijuana', 'was', 'easily', 'smuggled', 'boats', 'Reagan', 'Era', 'spent', 'millions', 'controlling', 'drug', 'trade', 'South', 'Florida', 'Cocaine', 'Cowboys', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'economy', '1970', 'what', 'kept', 'Miami', 'afloat', 'Director', 'Billy', 'Corben', 'story', 'Miami', 'skyline', 'built', 'not', 'bricks', 'steel', 'bricks', 'cocaine', 'interviews', 'interesting', 'smugglers', 'assasins', 'dealers', 'Ford', 'models', 'newscasters.According', 'film', '1970', 'marijuana', 'was', 'easily', 'smuggled', 'South', 'Florida', 'People', 'openly', 'off-loaded', 'bales', 'marijuana', 'sail', 'boats', 'public', 'docks', 'interference', 'According', 'dealers', 'film', '1970', 'cocaine', 'was', 'only', 'used', 'medical', 'professionals', 'who', 'could', 'afford', 'several', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'gram', 'price', 'tag', 'Eventually', 'Columbian', 'cartels', 'found', 'smugglers', 'willing', 'import', 'drug', 'used', 'Cuban', 'distributors', 'made', 'drug', 'readily', 'available', 'everyone', 'drug', 'was', 'first', 'used', 'low-lifes-Castro', 'refugees', 'set', 'free', 'opened', 'prisons-and', 'worked', 'way', 'ladder', 'become', 'party', 'drug', 'echelons', 'society', 'rest', 'country', 'struggled', '18', 'percent', 'rates', 'inflation', 'crashing', 'economy', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'Miami', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'deposits', 'had', 'stay', 'open', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'federal', 'investigators', 'estimate', 'one', 'bank', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'deposits', '2', 'million', 'year', 'was', 'actually', 'taking', '12', 'million', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'bank', 'Hundreds', 'opened', 'doors', 'launder', 'money', 'Columbian', 'cartels', 'cocaine', 'economy', 'came', 'Mercedes', 'dealerships', 'run-up', 'housing', 'costs', 'luxury', 'jewelery', 'dealers', 'Mercedes', 'dealership', 'South', 'Beach', 'had', 'three', 'month', 'waiting', 'list', 'rest', 'country', 'was', 'struggling', 'save', 'Honda', 'Civic', 'gas', 'went', 'it.It', 'never', 'stated', 'cocaine', 'economy', 'kept', 'whole', 'country', 'afloat', 'while', 'situation', 'continued', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'much', 'cocaine', 'was', 'being', 'imported', 'price', 'dropped', 'violence', 'skyrocketed', 'government', 'finally', 'decided', 'start', 'busting', 'people-not', 'coincidentally', 'time', 'when', 'economy', 'had', 'recovered', 'Most', 'people', 'interviewed', 'film', 'were', 'are', 'jail', 'many', 'people', 'legitimate', 'businesses', 'benefited', 'free', 'flowing', 'cash', 'cartels', 'used', 'new', 'found', 'wealth', 'build', 'Miami', 'skyline', 'doctor', 'who', 'interviewed', 'film', 'said', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'driving', 'work', 'counted', 'more', '30', 'skyscrapers', 'going', 'up', 'Miami', 'skyline-all', 'profits', 'drug', 'money.Some', 'documentary', 'will', 'be', 'familar', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'films', 'sitcoms', 'cocaine', 'Miami', 'most', 'know', 'tales', 'However', 'positive', 'economic', 'impacts', 'cocaine', 'were', 'totally', 'unknown', 'amazing', 'somewhat', 'shocking', 'vintage', 'news', 'footage', 'interviews', 'make', 'documentary', 'really', 'interesting', 'keep', 'essential', 'message', 'becoming', 'boring', 'classroom', 'lecture', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'chairman', 'unique', 'perspective', 'pretty', 'good', 'yarn', 'told', 'interesting', 'raconteurs']",Cocaine Cowboys

1035175,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B000KLQUUS,Theo,"[1, 1]","Recently I watched (and reviewed)How to Make Money Selling Drugs. In that case a deliberately provocative title was used merely as an attempt to attract a wider audience for what was in reality a polemical piece against the failed policy of prohibition.By contrast, I strongly suspect this film would be far more useful to anyone genuinely seeking instruction in such matters. It documents what went on inside the Miami drug trade in exquisite and unflinching detail - at least during the ""Miami Vice"" era of the 1970's through to about the mid 80's. The fast pace of the film not only makes for great storytelling: it also means an incredible amount of information is packed into a relatively short time-frame. As a result, this is a work that easily withstands repeated viewing. Indeed, it virtually demands it.Cocaine Cowboys has been criticized as being exploitative, and as lacking in real analysis of the wider social impacts. Surprisingly, such criticisms appear even in the product description here on Amazon. Personally, I don't think either criticism is fair. It is true that parents need to be aware that the R rating is there for a reason. Many extremely brutal still-shots in particular appear in this film. It does not skimp on the graphic reality of what happens when you shoot and kill people. But for the adult audience for which it is intended, the film is no more gruesome than it needs to be to honestly portray the events with which it is concerned. Nor more redolent with excess than to portray with equal honesty the milieu in which they occurred.As for the lack of analysis, that's like criticizing a horse for not being a camel. This is a documentary of the old school: it just tells you its story in as neutral a way as possible, and leaves you to form your own judgements. Yes, it is sensational to watch. But don't let that fool you. In its own way this is an extremely rigorous example of the documentary filmmaker's craft.None of which is to say that its creators aren't perfectly aware of the pop cultural context of their work. Of course they are! As a kind of knowing wink to the audience, Jan Hammer, famous for providing the music for Miami Vice, also provides the music for this work. He does a great job, too. His music alludes skilfully to the cocaine cowboys era without ever coming across as merely dated or self-referential. I think it would work perfectly well as straight background music even for those oblivious to the irony of his being chosen for this film.Finally, I would add that this is one case where I would definitely recommend buying the DVD. The generous extras add an enormous amount of additional information, and even include a short bonus documentary  ""Hustlin' With The Godmother: The Charles Crosby Story"". This picks up the life of the ""Godmother"" (Griselda Blanco) where the main feature leaves off.In the end, this is a film that enthralls and informs, but does not judge. It just lays everything out for us, as dispassionately as possible. What we make of it all is up to us.If I myself were to draw any inferences from what I have been shown, they would simply be these:I am quite certain that the flow of product continues unabated. It's just that by the time the 80's drew to a close, those at the top of the food chain had learned that what works well in Columbia does not work in the US. Daily machine-gun battles in the streets and malls of Miami are not good for business.And these people are powerful enough to enforce their interests.Theo.",5,Achieves Everything It Sets Out To,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,3514,"['Recently', 'watched', 'reviewed', 'How', 'Make', 'Money', 'Selling', 'Drugs', 'case', 'deliberately', 'provocative', 'title', 'was', 'used', 'merely', 'attempt', 'attract', 'wider', 'audience', 'what', 'was', 'reality', 'polemical', 'piece', 'failed', 'policy', 'prohibition.By', 'contrast', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'useful', 'anyone', 'genuinely', 'seeking', 'instruction', 'such', 'matters', 'documents', 'what', 'went', 'Miami', 'drug', 'trade', 'exquisite', 'unflinching', 'detail', 'least', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'era', '1970', 'mid', '80', 'fast', 'pace', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'storytelling', 'also', 'incredible', 'amount', 'information', 'packed', 'relatively', 'short', 'time-frame', 'result', 'work', 'easily', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'Indeed', 'virtually', 'it.Cocaine', 'Cowboys', 'been', 'criticized', 'being', 'exploitative', 'lacking', 'real', 'analysis', 'wider', 'social', 'impacts', 'Surprisingly', 'such', 'criticisms', 'appear', 'even', 'product', 'description', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'criticism', 'fair', 'true', 'parents', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'R', 'rating', 'there', 'reason', 'Many', 'extremely', 'brutal', 'still-shots', 'particular', 'appear', 'film', 'not', 'skimp', 'graphic', 'reality', 'what', 'when', 'shoot', 'kill', 'people', 'adult', 'audience', 'intended', 'film', 'more', 'gruesome', 'be', 'honestly', 'portray', 'events', 'concerned', 'more', 'redolent', 'excess', 'portray', 'equal', 'honesty', 'milieu', 'occurred.As', 'lack', 'analysis', 'criticizing', 'horse', 'not', 'being', 'camel', 'documentary', 'old', 'school', 'just', 'story', 'neutral', 'way', 'possible', 'form', 'own', 'judgements', 'Yes', 'sensational', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'own', 'way', 'extremely', 'rigorous', 'example', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'craft.None', 'say', 'creators', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfectly', 'aware', 'pop', 'cultural', 'context', 'work', 'course', 'are', 'kind', 'knowing', 'wink', 'audience', 'Jan', 'Hammer', 'famous', 'providing', 'music', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'also', 'music', 'work', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'music', 'skilfully', 'cocaine', 'era', 'ever', 'coming', 'merely', 'dated', 'self-referential', 'think', 'would', 'work', 'perfectly', 'well', 'straight', 'background', 'music', 'even', 'oblivious', 'irony', 'being', 'chosen', 'film.Finally', 'would', 'add', 'one', 'case', 'where', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'buying', 'DVD', 'generous', 'extras', 'add', 'enormous', 'amount', 'additional', 'information', 'even', 'include', 'short', 'bonus', 'documentary', 'Hustlin', 'Godmother', 'Charles', 'Crosby', 'Story', 'up', 'life', 'Godmother', 'Griselda', 'Blanco', 'where', 'main', 'feature', 'end', 'film', 'informs', 'not', 'judge', 'just', 'everything', 'out', 'as', 'dispassionately', 'possible', 'What', 'make', 'up', 'us.If', 'were', 'draw', 'inferences', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'am', 'quite', 'certain', 'flow', 'product', 'unabated', 'just', 'that', 'time', '80', 'drew', 'close', 'top', 'food', 'chain', 'had', 'learned', 'what', 'well', 'Columbia', 'not', 'work', 'US', 'Daily', 'machine-gun', 'battles', 'streets', 'malls', 'Miami', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'business.And', 'people', 'are', 'powerful', 'enough', 'enforce', 'interests.Theo']",Cocaine Cowboys
