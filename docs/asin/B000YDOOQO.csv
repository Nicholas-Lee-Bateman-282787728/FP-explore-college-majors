1119184,A1MJ682JQH816G,B000YDOOQO,Chad A. B. Wilson,"[3, 4]","People seem to either love or hate ""Great World of Sound."" Some people respond to the part traditional film, part mockumentary format of the movie.I admit that the premise is wonderful--two guys who need jobs get wrapped up working as ""producers"" for a record label called Great World of Sound. They audition people looking to be discovered and then require money as the artist's financial commitment. They don't deliver anything other than a crappy recording session; in essence, they swindle unsuspecting artists into giving away their money.It's a sad yet interesting premise, and its interest is compounded by the fact that the artists auditioning are real people coming in to make it big. They don't appear to know that it's a movie. They actually think they're auditioning for a record label. And then the guys hit them up for money.As a movie, however, Great World of Sound falls flat. Frankly, it's boring. The actors are good, and the premise is good, but the film would have been a lot better had it been a completely scripted film and did not involve the non-actors. Those parts are simply boring. Even the rest of the movie was slow, but it still had humorous parts.I hesitate to call this a comedy, though, for I don't remember laughing at all. As a version of American Idol, it works, but it really doesn't critique the American Idol culture. Sure, everyone wants to be a star, even when they're not that good. Maybe they're even willing to pay for it. But don't we already know that from watching American Idol?",2,A great premise but a flat movie,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,1526,"['People', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'Great', 'World', 'Sound', 'people', 'respond', 'part', 'traditional', 'film', 'part', 'mockumentary', 'format', 'movie.I', 'admit', 'premise', 'wonderful', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'need', 'jobs', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'working', 'producers', 'record', 'label', 'called', 'Great', 'World', 'Sound', 'audition', 'people', 'looking', 'be', 'discovered', 'then', 'require', 'money', 'artist', 'financial', 'commitment', 'do', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'anything', 'other', 'crappy', 'recording', 'session', 'essence', 'swindle', 'unsuspecting', 'artists', 'giving', 'away', 'money.It', 'sad', 'yet', 'interesting', 'premise', 'interest', 'compounded', 'fact', 'artists', 'auditioning', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'coming', 'make', 'big', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'know', 'movie', 'actually', 'think', ""'re"", 'auditioning', 'record', 'label', 'then', 'guys', 'hit', 'up', 'money.As', 'movie', 'however', 'Great', 'World', 'Sound', 'flat', 'Frankly', 'boring', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'premise', 'good', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'completely', 'scripted', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'involve', 'non-actors', 'parts', 'are', 'simply', 'boring', 'Even', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'slow', 'still', 'had', 'humorous', 'parts.I', 'hesitate', 'call', 'comedy', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'laughing', 'version', 'American', 'Idol', 'really', ""n't"", 'critique', 'American', 'Idol', 'culture', 'Sure', 'everyone', 'be', 'star', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'that', 'good', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'even', 'willing', 'pay', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'watching', 'American', 'Idol']",Great World of Sound

But you won't find any of the site's obtuse humor and pop-culture references in his directorial debut, ""Great World of Sound."" Instead, you'll find a subtly nuanced drama/mockumentary hybrid about the trials and tribulations of a pair of talent scouts working for a record label that may be less than trustworthy. Kene Holliday delivers a wonderful performance that would've been Oscar worthy had the film received more exposure. Pat Healy does a terrific job as well, and the banter between the two characters is very well-written.If you're expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy a la ""Office Space,"" look elsewhere.

1119187,A39NXAD50F6YVZ,B000YDOOQO,Winston Smith,"[2, 9]","A hybrid, of sorts, between ""Office Space"" and the TV show ""American Idol"". A pair of 30-something losers get a job at a struggling, shifty ""record company"", where they are tasked with trying to hustle a ""monetary commitment"" from wanna-be rock stars who thought they were auditioning for their big break. We go through the job training with the new hirees at the record label home office, which has the vibe of a kinder, gentler Glengarry Glen Ross, then follow our protagonists into the ""field"" for the lowest-budget talent-search road-trip ever.This is a pretty funny and original premise, but unfortunately there just isn't enough material here to sustain a full-length film. There's some chuckles here and there (e.g. one of the reps pretends to take a photo of each auditioning group with a cell-phone that has no camera) but nothing you're going to be quoting to anyone the next day at work. The amateur singers portrayed here (who may not be aware they are participating in a fictional film and think they really are auditioning) are mostly awful, but not in ways that are particularly interesting or memorable. And the various high-pressure sales pitches that follow, while well acted, are about as entertaining to watch as an actual high-pressure sales pitch from a real salesman would be (i.e. not so much.)I think this would have worked much better as a reality TV series--each week letting unsuspecting artists come in for an audition, then capture their reactions when actors portraying the judges harass them for money.",2,This long player should have been released as a single,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,1534,"['hybrid', 'sorts', 'Office', 'Space', 'TV', 'show', 'American', 'Idol', 'pair', '30-something', 'losers', 'get', 'job', 'struggling', 'shifty', 'record', 'company', 'where', 'are', 'tasked', 'trying', 'hustle', 'monetary', 'commitment', 'wanna-be', 'rock', 'stars', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'auditioning', 'big', 'break', 'go', 'job', 'training', 'new', 'hirees', 'record', 'label', 'home', 'office', 'vibe', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'then', 'follow', 'protagonists', 'field', 'lowest-budget', 'talent-search', 'road-trip', 'ever.This', 'pretty', 'funny', 'original', 'premise', 'unfortunately', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'material', 'here', 'sustain', 'full-length', 'film', 'chuckles', 'here', 'there', 'e.g', 'one', 'reps', 'take', 'photo', 'auditioning', 'group', 'cell-phone', 'camera', 'nothing', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'quoting', 'anyone', 'next', 'day', 'work', 'amateur', 'singers', 'portrayed', 'here', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'are', 'participating', 'fictional', 'film', 'think', 'really', 'are', 'auditioning', 'are', 'mostly', 'awful', 'not', 'ways', 'are', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'memorable', 'various', 'high-pressure', 'sales', 'pitches', 'follow', 'well', 'acted', 'are', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'actual', 'high-pressure', 'sales', 'pitch', 'real', 'salesman', 'would', 'be', 'i.e', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'reality', 'TV', 'series', 'week', 'letting', 'unsuspecting', 'artists', 'come', 'audition', 'then', 'capture', 'reactions', 'when', 'actors', 'portraying', 'judges', 'harass', 'money']",Great World of Sound
