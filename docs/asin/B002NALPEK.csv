She now teaches the freshman orchestra at a music conservatory. A former student of the conservatory, Gregory Pavan,  who has made it big in the music world is coming back to his ""musical roots""  to make a recording with the students. In the real world I doubt that such a person would choose to work with the freshman orchestra, but that is the story. Initially he is not happy to be working with a blind conductor, but is touched by the feeling of her cello music. As their relationship develops it is observed by her neighbor, Oliver, a widower of two years who has not shared with her how he really feels about her. His daughter takes cello lessons from her and he and Maryann are often in each other's company as neighbors and ""best friends"".Gregory finally persuades Maryann to have an operation to try and restore her sight. She has avoided it because she had already had one surgery that had failed. He promised to be there for her and when the bandages would come off she would see the man who loves her.*SPOILER ALERT*If you like stories where the quiet, unassuming friend wins over the flashy, flamboyant lover, then this is your kind of movie. The outcome is predictable, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I like ""happily ever after"". However, there were some little things in the story that were hard to swallow--like the portrayal of the freshman orchestra playing amazingly better by simply moving outside and going barefoot, even though they weren't using the printed music they had been struggling to play from minutes earlier (a technique which works not just once, but twice in this movie). If you have played a string instrument you will know that Amy Grant is not playing the cello, but to her credit, she does a much better job of faking it than Michael Landon ever did with the fiddle on ""Little House on the Prairie."" And at least Amy Grant really does know how to lead music--her downbeats are spot-on, unlike another recording artist who plays an orchestra leader in another movie.When I ordered this movie it had nothing but 5 star reviews on Amazon. To me that is a little generous. Maybe my 4 star rating is even a little generous. It is what I consider fun  ""escape watching"" and, as others have mentioned, it is something you can watch without worrying about the content. (After the review was posted with the complaints about the ""curse words"" I went back when I had a chance and watched it again. There were, from what I could tell, 3 uses of ""h***,"" 2 of the word ""d***,"" and one reference to someone as an ""a**,"" in the sense of someone stupid. All of this comes from the mouth of the ""Gregory Pavan"" character. I would prefer not to have that language, but I must admit it seems mild for a movie these days. Judge for yourself if it fits your standards or not.)",4,Song from the heart--or the feet,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,2939,"['Ms.', 'Grant', 'Maryann', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'sight', 'child', 'car', 'accident', 'accident', 'also', 'took', 'lives', 'parents', 'now', 'freshman', 'orchestra', 'music', 'conservatory', 'former', 'student', 'conservatory', 'Gregory', 'Pavan', 'who', 'made', 'big', 'music', 'world', 'coming', 'back', 'musical', 'roots', 'make', 'recording', 'students', 'real', 'world', 'doubt', 'person', 'would', 'choose', 'work', 'freshman', 'orchestra', 'story', 'Initially', 'not', 'happy', 'be', 'working', 'blind', 'conductor', 'touched', 'feeling', 'cello', 'music', 'relationship', 'observed', 'neighbor', 'Oliver', 'widower', 'two', 'years', 'who', 'not', 'shared', 'how', 'really', 'daughter', 'cello', 'lessons', 'Maryann', 'are', 'often', 'other', 'company', 'neighbors', 'best', 'friends', '.Gregory', 'finally', 'Maryann', 'have', 'operation', 'try', 'restore', 'sight', 'avoided', 'had', 'already', 'had', 'one', 'surgery', 'had', 'failed', 'promised', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'bandages', 'would', 'come', 'would', 'see', 'man', 'who', '*SPOILER', 'ALERT*If', 'stories', 'where', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'friend', 'flashy', 'flamboyant', 'lover', 'then', 'kind', 'movie', 'outcome', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'happily', 'ever', 'However', 'were', 'little', 'things', 'story', 'were', 'hard', 'swallow', 'portrayal', 'freshman', 'playing', 'amazingly', 'better', 'simply', 'moving', 'outside', 'going', 'barefoot', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'using', 'printed', 'music', 'had', 'been', 'struggling', 'play', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'technique', 'not', 'just', 'once', 'twice', 'movie', 'have', 'played', 'string', 'instrument', 'will', 'know', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'not', 'playing', 'cello', 'credit', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'faking', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'ever', 'did', 'fiddle', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'least', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'lead', 'music', 'downbeats', 'are', 'spot-on', 'recording', 'artist', 'who', 'orchestra', 'leader', 'movie.When', 'ordered', 'movie', 'had', 'nothing', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'little', 'generous', 'Maybe', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'even', 'little', 'generous', 'what', 'consider', 'fun', 'escape', 'watching', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'something', 'can', 'watch', 'worrying', 'content', 'review', 'was', 'posted', 'complaints', 'curse', 'words', 'went', 'back', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'watched', 'again', 'were', 'what', 'could', 'tell', '3', 'uses', 'h***', '2', 'word', 'd***', 'one', 'reference', 'someone', 'a**', 'sense', 'someone', 'stupid', 'mouth', 'Gregory', 'Pavan', 'character', 'would', 'prefer', 'not', 'have', 'language', 'must', 'admit', 'mild', 'movie', 'days', 'Judge', 'standards', 'not']",N/A
