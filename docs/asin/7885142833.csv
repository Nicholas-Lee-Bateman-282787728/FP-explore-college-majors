While it may not be history in the strictest sense, it is a very humanizing and well done take of portraying Cao Cao and his relationship with Guan Yu.I know that Donnie loves MMA, and after a couple of very successful portrayals on screen, (SPL, Flashpoint, Chen Zhen) I must admit, I love watching him do more traditional styles of kung fu. Yen's guan dao wielding is both beautiful and powerful on screen. I strongly feel that this is some of Donnie's best choreography (action director). His agility is astounding and showcased to good effect, especially in the final fight scene in the misty woods.As a drama, the pairing of Yen with Jiang Wen was very strong. These two gentlemen are wonderful in their verbal sparring scenes. Both characters are sympathetic and well acted.

Going into this film with this attitude I think will maximize your enjoyment of it. On its own, this film shines. The action is great, and it manages to condense a lot of source material into a single movie, unlike Red Cliff which spanned two already long films.Donnie Yen is solid, and his action choreography (yes he was the action director) was good apart from one fight scene that was too dark. I'm a huge huge fan of the Ip Man franchise. You can't compare the action in this movie with the action in Ip Man because they are completely different films. Donnie Yen, though, shows why he's the most dynamic and capable martial arts actor in the world today. And unlike his competition, the guy can really act.This DVD was a treat also.

488939,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,7885142833,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[0, 0]","Warning this film does contain some `fighting'. This is a full on version of the legend that is Guan Yu (Donnie Yen), he was famous in Ancient China for his prowess in the civil war and the eventual ousting of the Han Dynasty. It does help if you know a bit about the actual history as there was a lot of information crammed into the 109 minutes of film. It starts with a brilliant set piece battle and then gets into the political machinations that become the scene setter for the rest of the film.There is also a love interest where Guan Yu falls for the concubine of his blood brother, and she gets into scrapes with a rapidity that even Scooby Doo would baulk at. But he is always there to rescue her. There are some who have said this is not a martial arts film, but for me it was more or less constant and to be honest a bit boring in its' repetitiveness. Whilst it is beautifully shot and the soundtrack is both emotive and impressive, the plot comes across as contrived. There are crosses and double crosses and people change sides almost randomly.The real strength, or weakness depending on your point of view , are the action sequences. They are many and frequent. They normally involve Guan Yu fighting an army single handed whilst flying about the place to a dubbed on `fight soundtrack'. There is some wire work too, but I always find that mildly comic or annoying - people only fly in aeroplanes or by accidents. The sub titles are also an issue, they are in white and are quite often obscured by the back ground which means you can miss some plot development.There are also just so many plot holes, I especially like the way Guan masters the art of semi-automatic crossbow firing in a nano second. Everything seems to be a prelude for more fighting and it is the sort where inevitably one person at a time comes forward to do battle, and no-one stabs anyone in the back. I started popping out to put the kettle on when these started, as I always hate it when you know what the outcome would be. There was no attempt at subtlety except in the rather good performance of Wen Jiang who played the Machiavellian Cao Cao who managed to be both hero and villain often in the same scene.If you like a martial arts flick then you could do a lot worse, it has clearly had a lot of money spent on it and has many qualities and I was not bored, but the points I mention above meant that for me it was really only ok, hence the rating.",3,"China, Fighting, False Beards, Fighting, Concubines and some fighting!",1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,2438,"['Warning', 'film', 'contain', 'fighting', 'full', 'version', 'legend', 'Guan', 'Yu', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'was', 'famous', 'Ancient', 'China', 'prowess', 'civil', 'war', 'eventual', 'ousting', 'Han', 'Dynasty', 'help', 'know', 'bit', 'actual', 'history', 'was', 'lot', 'information', 'crammed', '109', 'minutes', 'film', 'brilliant', 'set', 'piece', 'battle', 'then', 'political', 'machinations', 'become', 'scene', 'setter', 'rest', 'film.There', 'also', 'love', 'interest', 'where', 'Guan', 'Yu', 'concubine', 'blood', 'brother', 'scrapes', 'rapidity', 'even', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'would', 'baulk', 'always', 'there', 'rescue', 'are', 'who', 'have', 'said', 'not', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'constant', 'be', 'honest', 'bit', 'boring', 'repetitiveness', 'Whilst', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'soundtrack', 'emotive', 'impressive', 'plot', 'contrived', 'are', 'crosses', 'double', 'crosses', 'people', 'change', 'sides', 'almost', 'randomly.The', 'real', 'strength', 'weakness', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'many', 'frequent', 'normally', 'involve', 'Guan', 'Yu', 'fighting', 'army', 'single', 'handed', 'whilst', 'flying', 'place', 'dubbed', 'fight', 'soundtrack', 'wire', 'work', 'too', 'always', 'find', 'mildly', 'comic', 'annoying', 'people', 'only', 'fly', 'aeroplanes', 'accidents', 'sub', 'titles', 'are', 'also', 'issue', 'are', 'white', 'are', 'quite', 'often', 'obscured', 'back', 'ground', 'can', 'miss', 'plot', 'are', 'also', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'especially', 'way', 'Guan', 'art', 'semi-automatic', 'crossbow', 'firing', 'nano', 'second', 'Everything', 'be', 'prelude', 'more', 'fighting', 'sort', 'where', 'inevitably', 'one', 'person', 'time', 'forward', 'do', 'battle', 'no-one', 'stabs', 'anyone', 'back', 'started', 'popping', 'out', 'put', 'kettle', 'when', 'started', 'always', 'hate', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'outcome', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'attempt', 'subtlety', 'rather', 'good', 'performance', 'Wen', 'Jiang', 'who', 'played', 'Machiavellian', 'Cao', 'Cao', 'who', 'managed', 'be', 'hero', 'villain', 'often', 'same', 'scene.If', 'martial', 'arts', 'flick', 'then', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'clearly', 'had', 'lot', 'money', 'spent', 'many', 'qualities', 'was', 'not', 'bored', 'points', 'mention', 'meant', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'ok', 'hence', 'rating']","The Lost Bladesman [2011, Hk] DVD"
488940,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,7885142833,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","""The Lost Bladesman"" (""Guan yun chang"") is a martial arts action film written and directed by Felix Chong and Alan Mak, a writers team behind a 2002 Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs."" Thickly bearded Donnie Yen (""Yip Man"") plays Guan Yun (- 219), a general in the last days of the Han Dynasty. Set in 200, about eight years before the events depicted John Woo's ""Red Cliff,"" ""The Lost Bladesman"" follows the heroic adventure story of Guan Yun, a legendary figure in Chinese history.The opening part of ""The Lost Bladesman"" may be a little complicated. Donnie Yen's character Guan Yen, captured by a powerful warlord and chancellor of the Han Dynasty Cao Cao (Wen Jiang), temporarily agrees to fight for Cao Cao, a rival warlord of Liu Bei (Alex Fong), to whom Guan Yen serves. Cao Cao wants Guan Yen to remain with him, but being loyal to his sworn brother Liu Bei, Guan Yen leaves Cao Cao. Cao Cao, who respects Guan Yen, orders his men to let him go unharmed, but on his way Guan Yen is confronted by six generals.As I said above, ""The Lost Bladesman"" is a martial arts action, and Donnie Yen (who also choreographed) shows what he can do in combat scenes, but those who are looking for intense action of ""Yip Man"" may be disappointed. Some action set-pieces are impressive, especially the one in which Yen is seen fighting against Andy On's general Kong Xiu, skillfully using a sword in a narrow walled path, but as a whole the film is about a drama between the characters whose belief and loyalty may cost them a life.Donnie Yen's performance as a dramatic actor is not bad, but Wen Jiang portraying Cao Cao as a Machiavellian strategist (but not a villain) steals every scene he is in. Slightly disappointing is Betty Sun, who plays Qi Lan, concubine of Liu Bei and love interest. Her character is created for the film, but her role (and a flashback sequence about her past) is superfluous.Fans of ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" may disagree, but I for one enjoyed myself watching ""The Lost Bladesman"" and its action set-pieces.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Donnie Yen as Guan Yen, a Legendary Chinese Warrior",1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,2038,"['Lost', 'Bladesman', 'Guan', 'yun', 'chang', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Felix', 'Chong', 'Alan', 'Mak', 'writers', 'team', '2002', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'thriller', 'Infernal', 'Affairs', 'Thickly', 'bearded', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'Yip', 'Man', 'Guan', 'Yun', '219', 'general', 'last', 'days', 'Han', 'Dynasty', 'Set', '200', 'about', 'eight', 'years', 'events', 'depicted', 'John', 'Woo', 'Red', 'Cliff', 'Lost', 'Bladesman', 'heroic', 'adventure', 'story', 'Guan', 'Yun', 'legendary', 'figure', 'Chinese', 'history.The', 'opening', 'part', 'Lost', 'Bladesman', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'complicated', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'character', 'Guan', 'Yen', 'captured', 'powerful', 'warlord', 'chancellor', 'Han', 'Dynasty', 'Cao', 'Cao', 'Wen', 'Jiang', 'temporarily', 'fight', 'Cao', 'Cao', 'rival', 'warlord', 'Liu', 'Bei', 'Alex', 'Fong', 'whom', 'Guan', 'Yen', 'Cao', 'Cao', 'Guan', 'Yen', 'remain', 'being', 'loyal', 'sworn', 'brother', 'Liu', 'Bei', 'Guan', 'Yen', 'Cao', 'Cao', 'Cao', 'Cao', 'who', 'Guan', 'Yen', 'orders', 'men', 'let', 'go', 'unharmed', 'way', 'Guan', 'Yen', 'confronted', 'six', 'generals.As', 'said', 'Lost', 'Bladesman', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'who', 'also', 'choreographed', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'combat', 'scenes', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'intense', 'action', 'Yip', 'Man', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'are', 'impressive', 'especially', 'one', 'Yen', 'seen', 'fighting', 'Andy', 'general', 'Kong', 'Xiu', 'skillfully', 'using', 'sword', 'narrow', 'walled', 'path', 'whole', 'film', 'drama', 'characters', 'belief', 'loyalty', 'may', 'cost', 'life.Donnie', 'Yen', 'performance', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'not', 'bad', 'Wen', 'Jiang', 'portraying', 'Cao', 'Cao', 'Machiavellian', 'strategist', 'not', 'villain', 'steals', 'scene', 'Slightly', 'disappointing', 'Betty', 'Sun', 'who', 'Qi', 'Lan', 'concubine', 'Liu', 'Bei', 'love', 'interest', 'character', 'created', 'film', 'role', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'past', 'superfluous.Fans', 'Romance', 'Three', 'Kingdoms', 'may', 'disagree', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Lost', 'Bladesman', 'action', 'set-pieces']","The Lost Bladesman [2011, Hk] DVD"
