If I have any complaints, it is the Audi's he drives. Having had an Audi A3 3.2 S series and seeing what a guy rolling back into me did to it, crushed front bumper and busted radiator, I doubt Statham's Audi could do all the stunts without some major dents and dings, but we don't see any. Hope they didn't have to wait nine weeks for parts like I did. Anyway these movies are great when you want to pop in some heavy popcorn eating fun. The storylines are a little stretched at times, but it is after all an actioner that wasn't meant to be overly realistic. The martial art stunt scenes will make you think of Jet Li or Jackie Chan and the car chases will put ""Bullitt"" to the test. I highly recommend this set for most the family.
