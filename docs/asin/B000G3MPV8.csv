I try to avoid Holocaust movies because I don't want to be freaked out but I tuned in because of the dolls.  This is a really easy movie to fall into.  Lukas Haas does a great job with the accent.  Michael Gross not so much.  It's really Lukas Haas's performance and Vanessa Zaoui's face that keeps this movie going.  It's easy to recommend and I will be reading the book.,5,not boring or off-putting,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,462,"['Lukas', 'Haas', 'great', 'boy', 'face', 'Vanessa', 'Zaoui', 'curls', 'face', 'really', 'drew', 'try', 'avoid', 'Holocaust', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'freaked', 'out', 'tuned', 'dolls', 'really', 'easy', 'movie', 'fall', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'great', 'job', 'accent', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'performance', 'Vanessa', 'Zaoui', 'face', 'movie', 'going', 'easy', 'recommend', 'will', 'be', 'reading', 'book']",N/A

(He was the little Amish boy in ""Witness"").Haas is outstanding in here, particularly in conveying his feelings throughout the film. It's a story that could easily be trite or corny but winds up appealing with no unpleasant scenes overdone. That could have happened since the girl (Vanessa Zaoui) is a traumatized kid with several mental problems. Michael Gross and Amy Aquino, meanwhile, do a decent job of playing Jewish parents and it's nice to see a father portrayed in a positive light, for a change.In summary, a good and somewhat underrated melodrama",4,Haas Lifts This Teen Melodrama,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,711,"['Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'movie', 'centered', 'two', 'young', 'teens', 'well-done', 'one', 'actors', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'veteran', 'age', 'was', 'little', 'Amish', 'boy', 'Witness', '.Haas', 'outstanding', 'here', 'particularly', 'conveying', 'feelings', 'film', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'trite', 'corny', 'up', 'appealing', 'unpleasant', 'scenes', 'overdone', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'girl', 'Vanessa', 'Zaoui', 'traumatized', 'kid', 'several', 'mental', 'problems', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'Amy', 'Aquino', 'meanwhile', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'playing', 'Jewish', 'parents', 'nice', 'see', 'father', 'portrayed', 'positive', 'light', 'change.In', 'summary', 'good', 'somewhat', 'underrated', 'melodrama']",N/A
998736,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B000G3MPV8,Deborah Earle,"[0, 1]","This poignant and stirring 1992 offering, based on a novel of the same name by Myron Levoy, explores the relationship of a young Jewish lad living with his parents in World War II era Brooklyn, and a war-shocked refugee.Lukas Haas, so memorable as little Samuel in ""Witness"", gives an equally winning portrayal of Alan Silverman, who, as is typical of boys in  his neighborhood, enjoys games of  stickball, and the company of his best friend, Shaun Kelly (Kevin Connolly). As is typical in such a tough neighborhood, the two get into their fair share of fights with peers who taunt them about their particular ethnicities, and always(in the modern vernacular) have each other's backs in the a fray.A mysterious, frizzy-haired blonde girl with a dazed and vacant expression is frequently seen tearing paper with her hands in the hall way of the apartment where Alan and Shaun live. They refer to her as ""Crazy Cat"", little realizing the impact she will have on their lives.The girl is Naomi Kirschenbaum(a sweet, vulnerable Vanessa Zaoui, whose looks and performance are more than faintly reminiscent of another blonde, docile-looking, French child actress, Brigette Fossey, who was popular back in the 1950s), a refugee from France, who, while hiding under her bed, where she had been helping her Resistance worker father(Mark Fincannon) destroy maps that would help Jews escape, saw the Nazis kill him.Naomi and her mother(Victoria Christian) live with Alan's neighbor, Mrs. Liebman(Zohra Lampert).One day, Alan's mother Ruth, (Amy Aquino) volunteers Alan to go sit with Naomi, and draw her out of her shell. Alan is naturally apprehensive about the affair, but does as he is told.He sits in a chair as Naomi sits on her bed tearing newspaper, and talks to her, but she goes into hysterics when he gets too close.Eventually, doll therapy is introduced. Alan begins communicating with her through  his cowboy doll, and  Naomi gradually begins to respond  with her doll, Yvette. But realistically,the road to the breakthrough is never straight up.Time away from his friends causes tension between Alan and his cronies, particularly Shaun, who resents not being told what  Alan's ""secret errand"" is. In due time, he finds out, and Naomi comes out of her shell and is able to start school again.The three become great friends. Naomi spends time with Alan's family(including Michael Gross as Alan's father, who gets the Brooklynite accent down pat), and truly begins to blossom.In Alan's company, the traumatized girl gives an in-depth revelation about the night her father  was killed, and confides to Alan that he reminds her a little of her father with his soothing tone of voice.But fate takes a cruel turn when a nasty classmate named Joe Condello(Charlie Dow), provokes Alan once too often in Naomi's company, and Alan and Shaun brawl with him. Soon, a re-traumatized Naomi, who sees Alan beaten about the head as her father was, disappears, and when found, the consequences are devastating.Sol Silverman consoles his son with the hope that all will one day be well, and  somehow, an astute observer may feel that this episode may point Alan towards a future career as a child psychiatrist.As the film reviews the budding relationship that was suddenly cut short, viewers may find themselves hoping for the best for these two children.As America continues to be at war, and consequently may have many more children who are war refugees within its boarders, this story remains both timely and highly recommendable, as it can be used to teach the youth of today the same lessons of compassion towards another that a young Jewish boy learned in 1940s Brooklyn.",5,Encouraging Compassion,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,3659,"['poignant', 'stirring', '1992', 'offering', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Myron', 'Levoy', 'relationship', 'young', 'Jewish', 'lad', 'living', 'parents', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'era', 'Brooklyn', 'war-shocked', 'refugee.Lukas', 'Haas', 'so', 'memorable', 'little', 'Samuel', 'Witness', 'equally', 'winning', 'portrayal', 'Alan', 'Silverman', 'who', 'typical', 'boys', 'neighborhood', 'games', 'stickball', 'company', 'best', 'friend', 'Shaun', 'Kelly', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'typical', 'such', 'tough', 'neighborhood', 'two', 'get', 'fair', 'share', 'fights', 'peers', 'who', 'taunt', 'particular', 'ethnicities', 'always', 'modern', 'vernacular', 'have', 'other', 'backs', 'fray.A', 'mysterious', 'frizzy-haired', 'blonde', 'girl', 'dazed', 'vacant', 'expression', 'frequently', 'seen', 'tearing', 'paper', 'hands', 'hall', 'way', 'apartment', 'where', 'Alan', 'Shaun', 'live', 'refer', 'Crazy', 'Cat', 'little', 'realizing', 'impact', 'will', 'have', 'lives.The', 'girl', 'Naomi', 'Kirschenbaum', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'Vanessa', 'Zaoui', 'looks', 'performance', 'are', 'more', 'faintly', 'reminiscent', 'blonde', 'docile-looking', 'French', 'child', 'actress', 'Brigette', 'Fossey', 'who', 'was', 'popular', 'back', '1950s', 'refugee', 'France', 'who', 'hiding', 'bed', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'helping', 'Resistance', 'worker', 'father', 'Mark', 'Fincannon', 'destroy', 'maps', 'would', 'help', 'Jews', 'escape', 'saw', 'Nazis', 'kill', 'him.Naomi', 'mother', 'Victoria', 'Christian', 'live', 'Alan', 'neighbor', 'Mrs.', 'Liebman', 'Zohra', 'Lampert', '.One', 'day', 'Alan', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'Amy', 'Aquino', 'volunteers', 'Alan', 'go', 'sit', 'Naomi', 'draw', 'shell', 'Alan', 'naturally', 'apprehensive', 'affair', 'told.He', 'sits', 'chair', 'Naomi', 'bed', 'tearing', 'newspaper', 'talks', 'hysterics', 'when', 'too', 'close.Eventually', 'doll', 'therapy', 'introduced', 'Alan', 'communicating', 'cowboy', 'doll', 'Naomi', 'gradually', 'respond', 'doll', 'Yvette', 'realistically', 'road', 'breakthrough', 'never', 'straight', 'up.Time', 'away', 'friends', 'tension', 'Alan', 'cronies', 'particularly', 'Shaun', 'who', 'not', 'being', 'told', 'what', 'Alan', 'secret', 'errand', 'due', 'time', 'out', 'Naomi', 'shell', 'able', 'start', 'school', 'again.The', 'three', 'become', 'great', 'friends', 'Naomi', 'time', 'Alan', 'family', 'including', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'Alan', 'father', 'who', 'Brooklynite', 'accent', 'down', 'pat', 'truly', 'blossom.In', 'Alan', 'company', 'traumatized', 'girl', 'in-depth', 'revelation', 'night', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'confides', 'Alan', 'little', 'father', 'soothing', 'tone', 'voice.But', 'fate', 'cruel', 'turn', 'when', 'nasty', 'classmate', 'named', 'Joe', 'Condello', 'Charlie', 'Dow', 'Alan', 'once', 'too', 'often', 'Naomi', 'company', 'Alan', 'Shaun', 'brawl', 'Soon', 're-traumatized', 'Naomi', 'who', 'Alan', 'beaten', 'head', 'father', 'was', 'disappears', 'when', 'found', 'consequences', 'are', 'devastating.Sol', 'Silverman', 'son', 'hope', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'well', 'somehow', 'astute', 'observer', 'may', 'feel', 'episode', 'may', 'point', 'Alan', 'future', 'career', 'child', 'film', 'budding', 'relationship', 'was', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'short', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'hoping', 'best', 'two', 'children.As', 'America', 'be', 'war', 'consequently', 'may', 'have', 'many', 'more', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'war', 'refugees', 'boarders', 'story', 'timely', 'highly', 'recommendable', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'teach', 'youth', 'today', 'same', 'lessons', 'compassion', 'towards', 'young', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'learned', '1940s', 'Brooklyn']",N/A
