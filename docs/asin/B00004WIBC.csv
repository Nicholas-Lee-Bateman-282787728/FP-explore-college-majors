It's a terrifying story about troubled teenagers, how they discover their classmate killed his girlfriend and how they act in this situation. Their indifference and unconcern shocks and intimidate as we see another latest X-generation waste their lives. ""Rivers's Edge"" is disturbing in the last degree and at times very hard to watch but it's the kind of a movie that really touches your heart. The director Tim Hunter showed remarkable talent in this work and it's a pity he didn't make something noticeable since then. I'd like to mention the cast which is also great - Keanu Reeves (who's interesting to watch at that young age), Dennis Hopper (who's good as always) and Crispin Glover with Daniel Roebuck who both played just awesome, maybe it was their best part ever.""River's Edge"" make you ponder about todays youth but you know - the film (which by the way was based on a true story) was made about twenty years ago, so now those kids must be in their late 30-s. And they must have grown up into decent clerks, fathers  etc. They hardly all became criminals. So I guess every time has its ""lost"" generation. But then they somehow find themselves.

E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I'm really surprised I haven't come across River's Edge at some point already, or even more unusual, that the film doesn't seem to be on any list of best movies of the 80's.  Unless I simply overlooked the obvious (which wouldn't be the first time, heh).  It's a really strange and ultimately fascinating drama about a teenage boy who tells his group of friends that he's killed his girlfriend and that the body is lying out in the woods by the river.  At first everyone is convinced he must be joking, but soon we realize the dreaded reality check that he's actually telling the truth.  I mean his friends are convinced he's joking to the point that they actually walk up to the body and poke it with a stick!One of the friends (played by a remarkably young looking Keanu Reeves) has a younger brother who's WAY too mature for his age and insistent on being a teenager by experimenting with drugs, illegal activity and other things in order to hang with the big boys so to speak, to the point that he occasionally plays a role in the cover-up of this murder with his one nunchuck-swinging friend.  Meanwhile the mother of the family is trying her hardest to keep everyone in check but by nightfall, they all leave and go their separate ways.  It's a chaotic mess basically.  To add more to the confusion, the boy who murders his girlfriend actually meets a strange old man who lives alone and has an obsession with a human-size doll.  The two of them form a friendship.  Strange stuff indeed!River's Edges is honestly compelling the entire way through with several curious moments of wondering how this complex storyline is going to end, and I think it ends on a really spectacular and satisfying note.  Ione Sky is a BEAUTIFUL teenager and she's one of the friends who threatens to spill the beans to the cops on one occasion, but upon realizing that she's too involved in the twisted complexity of the storyline, she ends up having a change of heart.  Sometimes -when the murder makes the news in one example- the situation between the friends gets rather heated, suspicious and thrilling.  What will happen to the man who murdered his girlfriend?  What will happen to the friends that didn't come forward with the knowledge of the murder right away?Considering this movie came out in 1986-87, this is when the heavy metal scene was fully underway so you'll hear plenty of heavy metal music similar to Iron Maiden, Metallica and others throughout the movie.  I like this music so I consider the soundtrack really good.  Also, be prepared for lots of nudity as they continue to show the naked dead girl lying on the ground whenever the friends drop by to figure out what to do with the body.Overall, an oddly compelling drama and that's putting it lightly.

555546,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00004WIBC,California Dreaming,"[1, 1]","I've seen this film several times, and it was on the MGM ""free"" channel the other night in HD.  So I had to record it, and I watched at least the first act again, and it didn't disappoint.  It rarely ever does, even after multiple viewings.And that is surprising, since the much-maligned Keanu Reeves stars, and I think that he might just give the best performance of his career in ""River's Edge.""  Peeking around the web, it appears that it wasn't his first film, but it surely was close; he'd only been acting professionally for about a year before the release.While I've always thought that ""Lord of the Flies"" was overrated -- I believe that I've read the book and seen the film, from memory -- I did like the idea that the writer and director here use some very similar themes to drive this modern-day morality tale.  In particular, you will find the role and acting by Joshua John Miller to be quite chilling; I believe that he was only about 10 or 11 when this was being filmed, and you will see how far a young kid can go off the rails without enough guidance.And of course, there are many other players -- Crispin Glover, who seems to be best playing edge-case-at-best characters -- and Dennis Hopper, who was almost always great.  And Daniel Roebuck seems to be the perfect choice to play the killer.And he still was that perfect choice, even though I believe that the real killer for whom this film was based was actually black.  I've been to Milpitas quite a few times, as that town is only about an hour's drive from my home, and I will say that it's a great place to buy a gun for protecting yourself from animals such as these.  But I've never visited the location where the body was found.  (I wouldn't be surprised if many people have, although personally, I don't think that it's as macabre in general as most people like to say.  Usually, that is only used as a cheap ad hominem to keep people from visiting actual crime scenes, in my opinion.  After all, cops visit crime scenes and nobody has a problem with that.)I think that this film is probably more like a 4.5, but I'm rounding up today as it's one of the most underrated films out there with similar subject matter and themes.

Indie, low-budget, whatever label you want to stick on this film, it actually delivers a watchable, puzzlingly intriguing plot from a young cast that by and large found later fame. Centering around the days immediately following the reasonless slaying of a teenage girl by her teenaged boyfriend, a killing that took place along a river's edge, this movie feels intellectually alienating, even as it also embroils subconscious instincts and compels a viewer to question what her or his own conduct might be if caught up in the situation presented here. A friend has committed murder, in fact unrepentantly committed murder, so what happens next? To what extent will and can normal life continue? Do you offer your friend help? ""Do what is right"" and go to the police? Is your friend suddenly someone to be feared? Far from being sensationalized, River's Edge proceeds so calmly downstream toward the inevitable rapids that it reaches something inside of almost everyone, even as it also disgusts, and not only for the crime at its heart, but because of the utter turmoil that exists peripherally and daily in the characters' lives.

Hartley,"[4, 6]","Before Larry Clarke's uber-nihilistic &quot;Kids&quot; (and the real-life Columbine tragedy) came along and made this movie look like a wacky Disney romp, Tim Hunter's &quot;River's Edge&quot; WAS the most disturbing look at modern teenage alienation ever put on film. Based on a true story, &quot;River's Edge&quot; examines a group of high school stoners and thier reactions (or inaction) to the thrill kill murder of one of thier friends by her boyfriend. The resulting angst, confusion, guilt and conflicted peer-pressure loyalty issues makes for cracking drama, and the talented, well-directed ensemble cast is more than up for it. Crispin Glover steals the show with a decidedly weird, but compelling performance as the &quot;alpha&quot; of the teen pack. Co-star Dennis Hopper once stated in an interview that of all the young actors he has worked with since he appeared in &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot;, Glover comes the closest (in terms of acting presence, not 'looks') to capturing James Dean's ghost. Keanu Reeves turns in a great performance, making it even more puzzling why he has since evolved into such an inert mannequin onscreen. The most interesting aspect of the film is that the more times you see it (and it does stand up to repeat viewings) the more darkly comic it becomes; not &quot;ha-ha funny&quot;, but &quot;funny&quot; in the same way &quot;To Die For&quot; and &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; are &quot;funny&quot;.

Drawing inspiration from a real-life event, screenwriter Neal Jimenez and director Tim Hunter tell a tale of a senseless, reasonless murder and the almost zombie-like apathy of the teenagers who know the murderer as a friend/acquaintance, see the corpse afterwards and yet decide to keep silent. Some people have called this movie implausible, but when we seem to read every day about kids killing other kids over clothes or teenagers opening weapons fire in elementary schools, is it really? This movie mines the same terrain as BLUE VELVET, namely a seemingly normal town hiding a deep secret that rears its ugly head out in the open, making the viewer want to flinch but still watch. The acting from Crispin Glover, Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper and Joshua Miller is taut and believable, and the cinematography of Frederick Elmes (long-time DP for David Lynch) further gives this movie a polish with a very noticeable hint of grime on top of it.After 27 years, does RIVER'S EDGE still hold up?

555552,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00004WIBC,J from NY,"[6, 7]","""River's Edge"" is probably the most important film Tim Hunter ever made.  It will probably leave an extremely bad taste the mouth of the casual viewer, which is in all likelihood the point.While this film is based on a real incident that occured in the mid-80's, since then there have been dozens of similar cases.  What makes this film special is that rather than taking a coldly objective or ""documentary"" style approach to the event, it makes an attempt to involve the viewer in the daily lives of apathetic youth, and to point a big index finger at the failure of family, society, and the kids themselves to generate some real concern or emotion over the death of another human being.Pretty much everyone knows the story: a high school student murdered his girlfriend after her having refused to have sex with him, and then babbles to his friends about it, none of whom told police.  The performances in this film range from mediocre to spectacular:Crispin Glover steals the show as young psychopath Layne, an iconoclastic figure in this twisted circle of ""friends"" who attempts to rally the youths into hiding Samson (Daniel Roebuck) and evoke some feelings of loyalty toward him.  Since none of the figures involved ( with the exception of Keanu Reeves, who once again proves that he can play a less than intelligent burn out very, very well, it's almost like he's not acting) are capable of emotion over their friends' death, Layne's frenzied mission is doomed to failure from the start.Dennis Hopper is one of his less impressive roles here as Feck, a reclusive biker/murderer who gives loopy lectures to the kids and sells weed to Layne.  The striking thing about the situation is the apathy that practically flies off every scene: Samson, the young killer, seems less affected than any of his peers by what he has done.  After leaving Jamie (his dead girlfriend) he goes to the local convenient store in search of a six pack of beer.  We gradually come to see that he is perhaps more insane than anyone else, even Hopper, who also murdered a woman decades ago and has a blow up sex doll as a substitute--and he's the good guy.I'd watch this film simply for Glover's performance, which oscillates between being manically charged to mired in total defeat.  It isn't so much about protecting his ""friend"" as it is about trying to get some sense of connection with his peers.  But everyone seems lost in their own orbits, and in the last scene, when the police are arriving, we see the young Layne lying on the grass, defeated.  This is a film which deserves more attention, as I'm sure it will take on a more prophetic quality as time goes by and more and more things like this occur.",4,"""He had his reasons!""",1099180800,"10 31, 2004",2004,2691,"['River', 'Edge', 'probably', 'most', 'important', 'film', 'Tim', 'Hunter', 'ever', 'made', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'extremely', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'casual', 'viewer', 'likelihood', 'point.While', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'incident', 'occured', 'mid-80', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'dozens', 'similar', 'cases', 'What', 'film', 'special', 'rather', 'taking', 'coldly', 'objective', 'documentary', 'style', 'approach', 'event', 'attempt', 'involve', 'viewer', 'daily', 'lives', 'apathetic', 'youth', 'point', 'big', 'index', 'finger', 'failure', 'family', 'society', 'kids', 'generate', 'real', 'concern', 'emotion', 'death', 'human', 'being.Pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'murdered', 'girlfriend', 'having', 'refused', 'have', 'sex', 'then', 'babbles', 'friends', 'none', 'whom', 'told', 'police', 'performances', 'film', 'range', 'mediocre', 'spectacular', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'show', 'young', 'psychopath', 'Layne', 'iconoclastic', 'figure', 'twisted', 'circle', 'friends', 'who', 'attempts', 'rally', 'youths', 'hiding', 'Samson', 'Daniel', 'Roebuck', 'evoke', 'feelings', 'loyalty', 'none', 'figures', 'involved', 'exception', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'play', 'less', 'intelligent', 'burn', 'out', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'almost', 'not', 'acting', 'are', 'capable', 'emotion', 'friends', 'death', 'Layne', 'frenzied', 'mission', 'doomed', 'failure', 'start.Dennis', 'Hopper', 'one', 'less', 'impressive', 'roles', 'here', 'Feck', 'reclusive', 'biker/murderer', 'who', 'loopy', 'lectures', 'kids', 'weed', 'Layne', 'striking', 'thing', 'situation', 'apathy', 'practically', 'scene', 'Samson', 'young', 'killer', 'less', 'affected', 'peers', 'what', 'done', 'leaving', 'Jamie', 'dead', 'girlfriend', 'local', 'convenient', 'store', 'search', 'six', 'pack', 'beer', 'gradually', 'come', 'see', 'perhaps', 'more', 'insane', 'anyone', 'else', 'even', 'Hopper', 'who', 'also', 'murdered', 'woman', 'ago', 'blow', 'up', 'sex', 'doll', 'substitute', 'good', 'guy.I', ""'d"", 'watch', 'film', 'simply', 'Glover', 'performance', 'being', 'manically', 'charged', 'mired', 'total', 'defeat', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'protecting', 'friend', 'trying', 'get', 'sense', 'connection', 'peers', 'everyone', 'lost', 'own', 'orbits', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'police', 'are', 'arriving', 'see', 'young', 'Layne', 'lying', 'grass', 'defeated', 'film', 'more', 'attention', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'take', 'more', 'prophetic', 'quality', 'time', 'more', 'more', 'things', 'occur']",N/A

Nearly all the kids have a dysfunctional family or other disruptive situation that leaves them untrusting of adults. The death of their friend by another friend creates a tension among them as to whether they should turn him in.The main group of kids is composed of Crispin Glover, Keanu Reeves, Ione Skye and Roxana Zal. Keanu lives with his little terrorist brother, Josh Miller, an even younger sister, his single mother and her do-nothing boyfriend. The other main character is ""Feck"" played by Dennis Hopper. He is a criminal in hiding, and is the main source for ""Feck weed"". Some of the acting is either nearly over the top (Glover) or questionable (Reeves), but Dennis Hopper is great as a rather strange character with a past and a large love doll, Ellie, as a friend. Josh Miller as the younger trouble-making brother is disturbing and excellent.Although the movie is a drama and is rather unnerving, it has some unusual humor, most of it coming from Feck and the younger brother, who is about 10 or 11 years old. At one point the kid is mad and goes to see his friend at night and taps on his window - ""Bring your numchuks. And get your dad's car. I know where I can get a gun"".The movie is heavy on smoking and drinking among teens and pre-teens, rampant swearing by teens and pre-teens, and teen sex. Oh yeah, a full frontal nude girl, though she's dead and turning a few colors. The DVD has the widescreen movie, chapter, subtitles (French/Spanish) and a trailer.

I watched it again tonight and have to say I believe I was more disturbed this time around then my first viewing.  As a teenager the most significant thing that stuck with me about this movie was the body and how she was left by the river.  This time around it was the apathy of the whole group of friends and the push/pull between brothers Matt & Tim.  I'm not sure what my group of friends would have done if put in a similar situation.Since the 60's our society has been on a rapid decline.  Each generation has had some form of social inadequacy.  In the 80's we were all slackers, even the so called jock/pinheads of our generation.  Drugs, alcohol, and sex were the norm.  Kids across all economic backgrounds were part of the latch-key generation, unsupervised, under stimulated.  Our role models were the musicians we listened to and the music videos we watched.True, movies today seem to grip harder.  Show more blood and guts.  Are far more graphic.  This movie though cuts to the solid core of my generation.  We were a bunch a slackers, drifters without a moral compass by which to guide us.  Only a nagging feeling or voice if you will, in the back of our heads as to what was right and what was wrong.I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie again.  It was well worth the time.  Dennis, Crispin, wonderful to say the least.  Keanu pulled off an extremely good performance and considering I have really considered him eye candy until now is saying a lot.  Joshua Miller really and truly disturbed me the most.  Bravo.  I wish I knew who played their little sister because she did the job so sweetly.

555560,AGK4BEIQ017HY,B00004WIBC,P. I. Johnson,"[0, 0]","River's Edge is a deeply disturbing film that is fast transcending cult status to becoming a bona fide movie classic. When a classmate (Daniel Roebuck) murders his girlfriend for no rational reason, self-appointed group leader, Lane (Crispin Glover), draws together their circle of friends to protect him in a misguided test of loyalty. Haunted by the senselessness, two decent-minded kids (Keanu Reeves and Ione Skye) grapple with their consciences before Reeves' character eventually tips off the police, well aware of the danger he faces for breaking the conspiratorial code of silence. Sadly, River's Edge has proven to be an all too perceptive and pioneering examination of the increasing nihilism of American youth since the 1980s. The increasing regard with which it is viewed by critics and collectors has been helped in no small way by events such as Columbine. The spate of school shootings by sociopathic teenagers increasingly beyond the control of teachers, parents and society seems entirely consistent with the bleak picture of American youth this film paints. As such it is the significant, depressing movie signpost for its generation, in much the same way as Rebel Without a Cause was for youth of the 50s. Unlike Rebel, (or even its own broad set of generational cohorts, from The Breakfast Club, the anachronistic The Outsiders to lighter fare like Reality Bites) the kids of River's Edge are not just alienated and misunderstood, but thoroughly nastier pieces of work - the products of a cynical, complacent and nihilistic late-Cold War sensibility. They are not crying out to be understood, but to be left alone. In this sense, its most obvious cinematic antecedent is Jonathan Kaplan's underrated Over the Edge (1979), which it resembles in more than a few ways. Despite the controversy associated with it, the movie's power derives from an understated, non-judgmental depiction of the inherent violence and depravity of its characters and situations. Equally, Reeves' character makes no grand, sweeping statements of principle and conscience.

Then, he shows all his friends the nude body.""A bunch of us are going to check it out,"" one girl tells another. ""It's probably some joke.""But, the kids are going to visit the body by truck loads. They literally convince one of them to cut work to ferry a bunch of kids out to the riverside so everyone can see.""Nobody has to find out.""  Layne (Glover) the self appointed ringleader of the young people, tells the group. ""There are a lot of people here, we bury her so she doesn't have to be found."" Their ersatz leader is doing his best to keep the gang together, to get John out of town when the police start searching for him because Jamie's dead and they can only help John.One of the boys' big adult role models is Feck (Dennis Hopper) an ex-biker who admits to having killed a girl he loved with his gun.  Feck provides the kids drugs and plays a key role in John's escape attempt.It seems, the only kid concerned is one girl, Clarissa (Ione Skye) who is too afraid to call the police because John might hurt her next. And still her reaction is muted.  ""I couldn't cry for her,"" she confesses. ""I could cry for that guy in ""Brian's Song"", but I couldn't cry for her...""All this is juxtaposed with a little girl's grief over her lost toy. The toy gets a burial and a grave marker.

This is pretty much a reflection of the reactions of most of the kids who've witnessed the girl's body.Finally, near the end when John's situation gets desperate, he tells precisely why he killed Jamie.

555563,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00004WIBC,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[12, 15]","This was a great movie, but it's not quite the social indictment that it purports to be.  Mostly it works on the power of its stars and some godawfully chilling mood music.Samson (AKA ""John"") is a not-so-gentle giant of a teen who impulsively strangles his girlfriend.  Though the murder and murderer are quickly common knowledge to local high-school denizens, nobody immediately runs to the police.  This doesn't keep just about everybody her age from gawking at her now stripped corpse when it's found along the river's edge.  Various reasons keep Samson's peers from even alerting the police to the body - mostly they have to do with loyalty.  In a bizarre twist, their loyalty stems not from Samson, but from his friend Layne, a local Death-Metal kid who is determined not to ""narc"" out one of his own.  While the rest remain silent, Layne makes Samson's safety and escape his personal crusade.  Matt (Keanu Reeves) stirs from the pack, and calls the police.  At first a suspect (he can't explain to the police the delay) Matt's released, whereupon he pretends to help Layne keep Samson safe.  Most of the film is confined to the late hours of a single night, when our characters split up and tragically collide.  When police flood the streets looking for Samson, it's clear that somebody ""Narced"".  Though Layne never suspects Matt, Matt's younger brother immediately fixates on his elder sibling's betrayal, and plots revenge.  At first, Layne stashes Samson with Feck (Dennis Hopper), an elder pot-head who's on the run for murder, but Samson is too impulsive to stay in one place for very long.  When Feck runs out of beer, the pair leave the safety of Feck's house for beer, bullets and a trip back to the river's edge.""River's Edge"" is a stirring flick, but it's not quite the statement of society's collapse that it purports to be.  (A nebbish, conservative student is put-down for just that sort of self-righteousness late in the story.)  Just too much of the story doesn't add up.  Matt's mom is simply weak - she's got a bossy live-in boyfriend, and looks to be have barely recovered from the sort of teenage existence now suffered by her kids.  (instead of being emboldened, she's actually the weakest character in the flick - ""I'm not your mother"", she rants near the end ""You're all mistakes!"")  Matt's brother plots revenge for Matt's treason - but he never connects with other characters in a way that suggests his loyalty.  The other's are supposedly in sway to Layne, but Crispin Glover's mannerisms are less death-metal than post-modern mime (he simulcasts most of his lines with his hands) and he can barely hold himself together, let alone his peers.  While separated from Layne, Matt uses his new-found inner strength to get closer to Clarissa (Ione Skye), but the story isn't sure which is really causing the other (maybe Clarissa is actually inspiring him to think past Layne).  Especially weird is the way that while Layne searches for Samson, Matt runs into him at a liquor store after hours.  There, using Feck's gun, and in front of Matt, Samson forces the storeowner to sell Matt beer.  Matt never tells Layne of the meeting.  The biggest hole is Feck.  The flick tosses him and Samson together in a night that climaxes with something out of ""Of Mice and Men"" - but the script only partly succeeds in creating that intimacy between Feck and Samson.  When Feck later says of Samson ""he didn't love her"", it's unclear whether he's referring to Samson's murdered girlfriend or to Elly, Feck's blow-up doll and captive passenger on that last night.That said, this is still an incredible flick.  Crispin Glover is still unforgettable as Layne (after watching enough of ""Edge"" you may find it hard not to talk like him).  The plot, for its holes, stays focused on that one last night.  If the ending is way-too-pat, it's probably because the flick's ambition is more than it can achieve.  In any case, I sat down for this click and couldn't pull myself away.  Supposedly based on a true story, ""River's Edge"" should be appreciated on its own, without us having to wonder where the true story became a way-out cautionary tale of impulsive murder and misplaced loyalty.",3,"doesn't quite add-up, but still unforgettable",1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,4193,"['was', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'social', 'indictment', 'be', 'Mostly', 'power', 'stars', 'godawfully', 'chilling', 'mood', 'music.Samson', 'AKA', 'John', 'not-so-gentle', 'giant', 'teen', 'who', 'impulsively', 'girlfriend', 'murder', 'murderer', 'are', 'quickly', 'common', 'knowledge', 'local', 'high-school', 'denizens', 'nobody', 'immediately', 'police', ""n't"", 'keep', 'just', 'everybody', 'age', 'gawking', 'now', 'stripped', 'corpse', 'when', 'found', 'river', 'edge', 'Various', 'reasons', 'keep', 'Samson', 'peers', 'even', 'alerting', 'police', 'body', 'mostly', 'have', 'do', 'loyalty', 'bizarre', 'twist', 'loyalty', 'not', 'Samson', 'friend', 'Layne', 'local', 'Death-Metal', 'kid', 'who', 'determined', 'not', 'narc', 'one', 'own', 'rest', 'remain', 'silent', 'Layne', 'Samson', 'safety', 'escape', 'personal', 'crusade', 'Matt', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'pack', 'police', 'first', 'suspect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'police', 'delay', 'Matt', 'released', 'help', 'Layne', 'keep', 'Samson', 'safe', 'Most', 'film', 'confined', 'late', 'hours', 'single', 'night', 'when', 'characters', 'split', 'up', 'tragically', 'collide', 'When', 'police', 'flood', 'streets', 'looking', 'Samson', 'clear', 'somebody', 'Narced', 'Layne', 'never', 'Matt', 'Matt', 'younger', 'brother', 'immediately', 'elder', 'sibling', 'betrayal', 'plots', 'revenge', 'first', 'Layne', 'Samson', 'Feck', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'elder', 'pot-head', 'who', 'run', 'murder', 'Samson', 'too', 'impulsive', 'stay', 'one', 'place', 'very', 'long', 'When', 'Feck', 'beer', 'pair', 'leave', 'safety', 'Feck', 'house', 'beer', 'bullets', 'trip', 'back', 'river', 'edge', 'River', 'Edge', 'stirring', 'flick', 'not', 'quite', 'statement', 'society', 'collapse', 'be', 'nebbish', 'conservative', 'student', 'put-down', 'just', 'sort', 'self-righteousness', 'late', 'story', 'Just', 'too', 'much', 'story', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'Matt', 'mom', 'simply', 'weak', 'got', 'bossy', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'be', 'have', 'barely', 'recovered', 'sort', 'teenage', 'existence', 'now', 'suffered', 'kids', 'instead', 'being', 'emboldened', 'actually', 'weakest', 'character', 'flick', ""'m"", 'not', 'mother', 'end', ""'re"", 'mistakes', 'Matt', 'brother', 'plots', 'revenge', 'Matt', 'treason', 'never', 'other', 'characters', 'way', 'loyalty', 'other', 'are', 'supposedly', 'sway', 'Layne', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'less', 'death-metal', 'post-modern', 'mime', 'most', 'lines', 'hands', 'can', 'barely', 'hold', 'together', 'let', 'alone', 'peers', 'separated', 'Layne', 'Matt', 'new-found', 'inner', 'strength', 'get', 'closer', 'Clarissa', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'story', ""n't"", 'sure', 'really', 'causing', 'other', 'maybe', 'Clarissa', 'actually', 'inspiring', 'think', 'Layne', 'Especially', 'weird', 'way', 'Layne', 'searches', 'Samson', 'Matt', 'liquor', 'store', 'hours', 'using', 'Feck', 'gun', 'front', 'Matt', 'Samson', 'storeowner', 'sell', 'Matt', 'beer', 'Matt', 'never', 'Layne', 'meeting', 'biggest', 'hole', 'Feck', 'flick', 'Samson', 'together', 'night', 'something', 'Mice', 'Men', 'script', 'only', 'partly', 'creating', 'intimacy', 'Feck', 'Samson', 'When', 'Feck', 'later', 'Samson', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'unclear', 'referring', 'Samson', 'murdered', 'girlfriend', 'Elly', 'Feck', 'blow-up', 'doll', 'captive', 'passenger', 'last', 'said', 'still', 'incredible', 'flick', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'still', 'unforgettable', 'Layne', 'watching', 'enough', 'Edge', 'may', 'find', 'hard', 'not', 'talk', 'plot', 'holes', 'stays', 'focused', 'one', 'last', 'night', 'ending', 'way-too-pat', 'probably', 'flick', 'ambition', 'more', 'can', 'achieve', 'case', 'sat', 'down', 'click', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'away', 'Supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'River', 'Edge', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'own', 'having', 'wonder', 'where', 'true', 'story', 'became', 'way-out', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'impulsive', 'murder', 'misplaced', 'loyalty']",N/A

555567,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00004WIBC,Steven Reynolds,"[7, 10]","When high-school student Samson 'John' Tollet strangles his girlfriend, Jamie, on the riverbank - ""because she was shooting her mouth off"" - he freely admits the crime to his friends and takes them to see the body. Their reactions vary. The group's leader, Layne (Crispin Glover), argues that Jamie's dead so there's nothing they can do for her, but they can save John if they dispose of the body and all keep their mouths shut. However, Matt (Keanu Reeves), may be the only member of the group with enough empathy and courage to do the right thing... Although fictional, ""River's Edge"" was inspired by the true case of Marcy Conrad who was murdered by her boyfriend Anthony Jacques Broussard in Milpitas, California, in 1981. It isn't a great film, but it's interesting because it was one of the first to explore the milieu of what would soon become known as Generation X. Strung out on dope and failed by their absent or useless parents, these kids are too jaded to feel anything, even in the face of death. Through one of their teachers, Mr Burkewaite, Neal Jiminez's screenplay points to a contrast between these Gen X slackers and their politically-engaged counterparts in the 1960s. Also, their aging dope dealer, Feck (Dennis Hopper), killed his girlfriend, too, but under pointedly different circumstances: unlike John, he loved his girlfriend and killing her wasn't simply a way of feeling more ""alive"". But such times have passed. For these kids, the only apparent choice is between copping out and conservatism. It's a simplistic position, and the screenplay isn't as nuanced as it might have been. Still, it's a reasonably engaging film. How you respond to it may well be a function of how much you can tolerate Crispin Glover. Admittedly, his unique performance style suits the slightly crazed Layne but, as always with Glover, it borders on unintentionally funny and this tends to dilute the impact of what's going on. By contrast, Keanu Reeves enthusiasts will be pleased to find an early film in which he actually acts.

555571,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00004WIBC,Wuchak,"[5, 7]","""River's Edge"" (1986) was based on a true story that took place in 1981: a high school student murders his girlfriend and tells his friends at school about it; the group goes to view the body in the woods but they're so apathetic and spiritually bereft that no one informs the authorities and the body just lies there for a couple of days.What struck me about the film was how much it reminded me of real life experiences, both as a youth growing up and also as an adult dealing with youths. Here are some of the things in the movie that I've also experienced:- Kids as young as 11-13 obsessed with ""partying.""- The idolization of drugs (pot, pills, etc.) and the party lifestyle above all else.- Kids -- that young and older -- out all night doing whatever (partying, having sex, crime).- Parents who aren't much more than phantoms in their kid's lives and therefore allow such.- Older, crazy dudes that the youths sometimes hang with, get drugs from or look up to.- The group dynamics of such youths and the unwritten law of not being a ""narc.""- Killing a friend and leaving the body where it lies for a couple of days.This was (and is) the downside of the 60's revolution -- a somewhat sad emptiness in people who have lost their innate moral compass with the passing of religious faith as they desperately search for meaning or cause in their new secular frontier (Layne's ""cause"" in the film is rigid loyalty to John, since he had ""his reasons"" for murdering the girl, and covering up his crime). Most of the characters are neither likable nor unlikable; they're just human beings trying to live and find meaning or fulfillment with the hand they've been dealt.The film runs 99 minutes and was shot in California (Sacramento, La Crescenta and Los Angeles).FINAL WORD: The film details the dark side of coming-of-age in modern America. People who have grown up in loving homes with positive role models and friends probably won't like ""River's Edge."" They'll likely think it's trash. However, those of us who grew up in the dysfunctional insanity depicted in the film understand it fully. And many of us are doing everything in our power to prevent our kids and other youths from experiencing it.GRADE: B+",4,Cry for the children,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,2209,"['River', 'Edge', '1986', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'took', 'place', '1981', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'murders', 'girlfriend', 'friends', 'school', 'group', 'view', 'body', 'woods', ""'re"", 'so', 'apathetic', 'spiritually', 'bereft', 'one', 'authorities', 'body', 'just', 'couple', 'days.What', 'struck', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'reminded', 'real', 'life', 'experiences', 'youth', 'growing', 'up', 'also', 'adult', 'dealing', 'youths', 'Here', 'are', 'things', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'also', 'experienced', 'Kids', 'as', 'young', '11-13', 'obsessed', 'partying', 'idolization', 'drugs', 'pot', 'pills', 'etc', 'party', 'lifestyle', 'else.-', 'Kids', 'young', 'older', 'night', 'doing', 'partying', 'having', 'sex', 'crime', '.-', 'Parents', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'phantoms', 'kid', 'lives', 'therefore', 'allow', 'such.-', 'Older', 'crazy', 'dudes', 'youths', 'sometimes', 'hang', 'get', 'drugs', 'look', 'up', 'to.-', 'group', 'dynamics', 'such', 'youths', 'unwritten', 'law', 'not', 'being', 'narc', 'Killing', 'friend', 'leaving', 'body', 'where', 'couple', 'days.This', 'was', 'downside', '60', 'revolution', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'emptiness', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'innate', 'moral', 'compass', 'passing', 'religious', 'faith', 'desperately', 'search', 'meaning', 'cause', 'new', 'secular', 'frontier', 'Layne', 'cause', 'film', 'rigid', 'loyalty', 'John', 'had', 'reasons', 'murdering', 'girl', 'covering', 'up', 'crime', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'unlikable', ""'re"", 'just', 'human', 'beings', 'trying', 'live', 'find', 'meaning', 'fulfillment', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dealt.The', 'film', '99', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'California', 'Sacramento', 'La', 'Crescenta', 'Los', 'Angeles', '.FINAL', 'WORD', 'film', 'details', 'dark', 'side', 'coming-of-age', 'modern', 'America', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'loving', 'homes', 'positive', 'role', 'models', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'River', 'Edge', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'think', 'trash', 'However', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'dysfunctional', 'insanity', 'depicted', 'film', 'understand', 'fully', 'many', 'are', 'doing', 'everything', 'power', 'prevent', 'kids', 'other', 'youths', 'experiencing', 'it.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

I think Keanu Reeves was great in this movie as the confused friend Matt, and Dennis Hopper was excellent as the crazy Feck. Crispin Glover truly steals every scene. His acting is frighteningly real, and incredibly skilled for a guy in his early 20s. All the professional critics at the time accused Glover of overacting. I thought he was great. His skill pierces through the screen and captures your heart; here Layne (Crispin) is going out of his way to help his friend to the point of psychotic numbness to the reality. I discovered this movie about a year ago (when I was 14) but it is timeless in capturing youth apathy to life. Simply put... INCREDIBLE. This is definitely a cult classic nowadays, and is worth checking out.",5,Incredible,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,855,"['River', 'Edge', '1980', 'white', 'surburia', 'reaction', '6', 'teens', 'murder', 'friend', 'think', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'confused', 'friend', 'Matt', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'was', 'excellent', 'crazy', 'Feck', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'truly', 'scene', 'acting', 'frighteningly', 'real', 'incredibly', 'skilled', 'guy', 'early', '20s', 'professional', 'critics', 'time', 'accused', 'Glover', 'overacting', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'skill', 'pierces', 'screen', 'heart', 'here', 'Layne', 'Crispin', 'going', 'way', 'help', 'friend', 'point', 'psychotic', 'numbness', 'reality', 'discovered', 'movie', 'year', 'ago', 'when', 'was', '14', 'timeless', 'capturing', 'youth', 'apathy', 'life', 'Simply', 'put', 'INCREDIBLE', 'definitely', 'cult', 'classic', 'nowadays', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
