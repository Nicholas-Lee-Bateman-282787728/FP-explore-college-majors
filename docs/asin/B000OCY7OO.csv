1063606,A21IIROYHZV7VO,B000OCY7OO,BlackDragon,"[6, 6]","I recall watching this when it was on the air, but I had forgotten about it. After picking up this 5 pc DVD set and watching it again, it makes me hunger for more episodes. But alas! like the t.v. series ""Dark Angel"" we'll never know what would've happened after the cliff-hanger ending.A fan of the ""Crow"" movies, I personally liked Mark Dacascos as the ""Eric Draven"" character. He gives the character a sensitive persona when of course he's not in his CROW form. Striving to be reuited with his dead love & soul-mate ""Shelly Webster"" he tries to put right what goes wrong. Mark's martial artist skills come out beautifully in this series.The pilot opens basically re-telling the story as seen in the original ""Crow"" movie that starred Brandon Lee, but with a few adaptations & changes. One year after Eric and Shelly are brutally murdered, the mystical crow who has the power to bring back a soul, brings Eric back to life. Being neither dead nor alive he wanders the earth with strange powers. At first he goes after the ones responsible for the murders of him and his beloved Shelly, but then he teams up with the police Detective Albrecht in helping to solve other crimes. Yet, he never loses sight of trying to become re-united with Shelly somehow, someway or someday.If you're a ""Crow"" (or Mark Dacascos) fan, then I would highly recommend this set. But don't try to compare it to the other ""Crow"" movies, appreciate it for what it is a series in it's own light. I will treasure this DVD set & probably re-watch it, it was worth every cent that I paid for it.",5,Crow: The t.v.

1063607,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000OCY7OO,Brian E. Erland,"[28, 28]","The short-lived television series `The Crow - Stairway To Heaven' is yet another incarnation of the popular movies chronicling the exploits of the tormented Eric Draven on his unending battle against the forces of darkness and his quest to join his beloved Shelly waiting on the Otherside. Building on the foundation established by the '94 cult classic `The Crow' starring the late Brandon Lee, this serialized retelling and extension of the Crow's ongoing saga stars Mark Dacascos in the role of the black garbed, supernatural avenger.Mark is perfect for the part, succeeding in both emulating and expanding on the role and persona so vividly portrayed by Brandon. The television series also did an admirable job at duplicating the overall gothic atmosphere and morose melancholy that permeated the original film. Someone definitely did their homework before going into production of the series.In my opinion the glue that holds the saga together while adding depth and dimension to the storyline is the tragic love story between Eric and Shelly. It's their ethereal, intermittent meetings between this world and the next that constitute the soul of the Crow mythos and validates his reasoning for battling on. This romantic, gothic essence is beautifully recaptured in this television series and should help to draw more female interest to an otherwise male dominated audience.",4,"""We Are Forever Lovers"" ~ Supernatural Hero, Gothic Romance",1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,1379,"['short-lived', 'television', 'series', 'Crow', 'Stairway', 'Heaven', 'yet', 'incarnation', 'popular', 'movies', 'chronicling', 'exploits', 'tormented', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'unending', 'battle', 'forces', 'darkness', 'quest', 'join', 'beloved', 'Shelly', 'waiting', 'Otherside', 'Building', 'foundation', 'established', ""'94"", 'cult', 'classic', 'Crow', 'starring', 'late', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'serialized', 'retelling', 'extension', 'Crow', 'ongoing', 'saga', 'stars', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'role', 'black', 'garbed', 'supernatural', 'avenger.Mark', 'perfect', 'part', 'succeeding', 'emulating', 'expanding', 'role', 'persona', 'so', 'vividly', 'portrayed', 'Brandon', 'television', 'series', 'also', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'duplicating', 'overall', 'gothic', 'atmosphere', 'morose', 'melancholy', 'permeated', 'original', 'film', 'Someone', 'definitely', 'did', 'homework', 'going', 'production', 'series.In', 'opinion', 'glue', 'saga', 'together', 'adding', 'depth', 'dimension', 'storyline', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'Eric', 'Shelly', 'ethereal', 'intermittent', 'meetings', 'world', 'next', 'constitute', 'soul', 'Crow', 'mythos', 'reasoning', 'battling', 'romantic', 'gothic', 'essence', 'beautifully', 'recaptured', 'television', 'series', 'should', 'help', 'draw', 'more', 'female', 'interest', 'otherwise', 'male', 'dominated', 'audience']",N/A

1063610,A3D3DJKKMLCRYZ,B000OCY7OO,"Erin ""skyblueboy""","[1, 1]","And I mean that as a compliment. It's certainly no disrespect towards Brandon either. What it means is that people are saying that Mark looks like Brandon and, other than the fact that they're part Asian and Caucasian and actors who are martial artists, that's where the similarities end.In regards to the show, it is for the most part hard to watch. The show certainly doesn't have to be as grim as the original movie, but it comes off light, devoid of substance and generic. While the main actors are generally good in their roles, some of the guest actors are fairly painful to watch.Even Mark falls short a number of times in his delivery. Often, his method of speaking sounds forced, as though his acting coach told him to put emphasis on certain words to make them stand out. Well, sometimes that's a good idea. But it can become a crutch and there are times when a more natural delivery works better. For the most part though, he turns in a decent performance.The writing is often uninteresting, with only an occasional bit of dialogue that rises above mediocrity. The theme of this show could lend itself to more poetic language, dealing with the concept of death and love that transcends that, but it's often just mundane.Still, if you're as big a fan of Mark Dacascos as I am, this is a must have. The martial arts you see on here are of the kind that usually seem to get cut from his movies. Here, you get to see him doing some truly phenomenal  stuff. One scene from Episode 12 shows him balancing on a chair in a way that has to be seen to believed.There isn't much in the way of extras and what there is is fairly disappointing. I mentioned the guest actors not being that interesting. Well, we get a lengthy outtake of one trying to get into character. Instead of that, why not show more of Mark training, fight choreography, etc? I will say that the gag reel is hilarious, but that and the minor additional features leaves much to be desired.It does have its high marks in areas, but fans of the comic and original movie will likely not like the approach taken here. I hope they'll give it a try though and look at the things it does well. Fans of Mark will, of course, want this. It does have great moments, but could have been stronger with better writing and a few other tweaks.",4,Mark Dacascos is not Brandon Lee,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,2297,"['mean', 'compliment', 'certainly', 'disrespect', 'Brandon', 'either', 'What', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'Mark', 'Brandon', 'other', 'fact', ""'re"", 'part', 'Asian', 'Caucasian', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'martial', 'artists', 'where', 'similarities', 'end.In', 'regards', 'show', 'most', 'part', 'hard', 'watch', 'show', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'as', 'grim', 'original', 'movie', 'off', 'light', 'devoid', 'substance', 'generic', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'roles', 'guest', 'actors', 'are', 'fairly', 'painful', 'watch.Even', 'Mark', 'short', 'number', 'times', 'delivery', 'Often', 'method', 'speaking', 'sounds', 'forced', 'acting', 'coach', 'told', 'put', 'emphasis', 'certain', 'words', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'Well', 'good', 'idea', 'can', 'become', 'crutch', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'more', 'natural', 'delivery', 'better', 'most', 'part', 'decent', 'performance.The', 'writing', 'often', 'uninteresting', 'only', 'occasional', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'mediocrity', 'theme', 'show', 'could', 'lend', 'more', 'poetic', 'language', 'dealing', 'concept', 'death', 'love', 'often', 'just', 'mundane.Still', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'am', 'must', 'have', 'martial', 'arts', 'see', 'here', 'are', 'kind', 'usually', 'seem', 'get', 'cut', 'movies', 'Here', 'get', 'see', 'doing', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'stuff', 'One', 'scene', 'Episode', '12', 'balancing', 'chair', 'way', 'be', 'seen', 'believed.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'what', 'fairly', 'disappointing', 'mentioned', 'guest', 'actors', 'not', 'being', 'interesting', 'Well', 'get', 'lengthy', 'outtake', 'one', 'trying', 'get', 'character', 'Instead', 'why', 'not', 'show', 'more', 'Mark', 'training', 'fight', 'choreography', 'etc', 'will', 'say', 'gag', 'reel', 'hilarious', 'minor', 'additional', 'features', 'much', 'be', 'desired.It', 'have', 'high', 'marks', 'areas', 'fans', 'comic', 'original', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'approach', 'taken', 'here', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'give', 'try', 'look', 'things', 'well', 'Fans', 'Mark', 'will', 'course', 'want', 'have', 'great', 'moments', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'better', 'writing', 'few', 'other', 'tweaks']",N/A

I'm surprised how many people in the reviews seem to be divided on its quality. It's based on the first films characters, but also you have to think of it in terms of a series, they couldn't just keep reenacting the movie. They added new ideas and some worked really well I thought, while others weren't as clear, but it's hard to tell as the show only got one season. Basically, if you liked the movie and are really into the premise itself, you'll find an interesting take on it in the show. I personally liked the sequels, although I agree they aren't nearly as well done as the first, and some have been much better than others, but if you really enjoy all things Crow, this will provide a lot to like, if nothing more than Mark Dacascos who does a great job despite having the enormous task of living up to Brandon Lee.",5,Finally...,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,917,"[""'m"", 'amazed', 'took', 'long', 'release', 'series', 'DVD', 'better', 'late', 'never', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'reviews', 'seem', 'be', 'divided', 'quality', 'based', 'first', 'films', 'characters', 'also', 'have', 'think', 'terms', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'keep', 'reenacting', 'movie', 'added', 'new', 'ideas', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'thought', 'others', 'were', ""n't"", 'clear', 'hard', 'tell', 'show', 'only', 'got', 'one', 'season', 'Basically', 'liked', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'premise', ""'ll"", 'find', 'interesting', 'take', 'show', 'personally', 'liked', 'sequels', 'agree', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'first', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'others', 'really', 'enjoy', 'things', 'Crow', 'will', 'provide', 'lot', 'like', 'nothing', 'more', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'having', 'enormous', 'task', 'living', 'up', 'Brandon', 'Lee']",N/A

1063621,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B000OCY7OO,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[3, 3]","I simply love this series, every minute of it.  Sort of like Angel, though much less tongue-in-cheek, deeper, and LOADED with heart.  Reminiscent of both Once Upon a Time and Person of Interest, in mood and tone, I thought.As another reviewer said, each episode gets better and better, building slowly, developing character, and expanding the scope.  We begin with tragedy, and the birth of a being with superhuman powers, a la Superman- invincible, thrilling, see what he does to bad guys!  (""My God, what ARE you??"" they cry, as he metes out justice and rights wrongs.)  But slowly, it builds, deepens, exploring the nature of good and evil, death, our purpose here, redemption, soul mates, the power of love, and much more (such as recovery, friendship, healing).  It keeps all these balls in the air while developing the characters, we come to care about them, know them.  The plots are simple, actually incidental, the characters and their relationships with each other are core (as in any good story).The series is actually one long story- characters reappear, threads begun before are taken up and brought to fruition throughout, often in unexpected and surprising ways.  Appropriate, too, I would say, for older teenagers (maybe 14 and up) and for spurring family discussions.  The series handles a wide range of issues honestly, yet tastefully (addiction, for example).Mark Dacascos is simply marvelous as The Crow- alternately enigmatic, powerful, troubled, lost, charming, funny, an innocent.  Is he a lost soul, adrift between worlds, an angel, what?  Whatever he is, he's simply beautiful, in every guise and phase- his face, his body, his martial arts moves, the way he rides his Harley, the way he walks, grace personified.  And I love the way he delivers clever/funny quips, however great the menace.All the actors are topnotch, and the show at times features beautiful scenery and special effects.  It also showcases music (in smallish doses) from alternative bands, and credits them at the end of each eposode.  And unlike the original Crow film on which this is based, we get to see rockstar Draven sing and perform, and Dacascos excels there too.This series is subtle- it doesn't hit you over the head with things, the dialogue is simple, yet effective- to sum it up, it's absorbing, moves you from laughing out loud to tears to cheering for the good guys, just splendid, inspiring.  And for this price...Grab it!  I intend to buy another for backup.",5,What more could you ask for?,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,2470,"['simply', 'love', 'series', 'minute', 'Sort', 'Angel', 'though', 'much', 'less', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'deeper', 'LOADED', 'heart', 'Reminiscent', 'Once', 'Time', 'Person', 'Interest', 'mood', 'tone', 'thought.As', 'reviewer', 'said', 'episode', 'better', 'better', 'building', 'slowly', 'developing', 'character', 'expanding', 'scope', 'begin', 'tragedy', 'birth', 'being', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'la', 'Superman-', 'invincible', 'thrilling', 'see', 'what', 'bad', 'guys', 'My', 'God', 'what', 'ARE', 'cry', 'out', 'justice', 'rights', 'wrongs', 'slowly', 'deepens', 'exploring', 'nature', 'good', 'evil', 'death', 'purpose', 'here', 'redemption', 'soul', 'mates', 'power', 'love', 'much', 'more', 'such', 'recovery', 'friendship', 'healing', 'balls', 'air', 'developing', 'characters', 'come', 'care', 'know', 'plots', 'are', 'simple', 'actually', 'incidental', 'characters', 'relationships', 'other', 'are', 'core', 'good', 'story', '.The', 'series', 'actually', 'one', 'long', 'story-', 'characters', 'reappear', 'threads', 'begun', 'are', 'taken', 'up', 'brought', 'fruition', 'often', 'unexpected', 'surprising', 'ways', 'Appropriate', 'too', 'would', 'say', 'older', 'teenagers', 'maybe', '14', 'up', 'spurring', 'family', 'discussions', 'series', 'wide', 'range', 'issues', 'honestly', 'yet', 'tastefully', 'addiction', 'example', '.Mark', 'Dacascos', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'Crow-', 'alternately', 'enigmatic', 'powerful', 'troubled', 'lost', 'charming', 'funny', 'innocent', 'lost', 'soul', 'adrift', 'worlds', 'angel', 'what', 'Whatever', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'guise', 'phase-', 'face', 'body', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'way', 'Harley', 'way', 'grace', 'personified', 'love', 'way', 'clever/funny', 'quips', 'however', 'great', 'menace.All', 'actors', 'are', 'topnotch', 'show', 'times', 'features', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'special', 'effects', 'also', 'music', 'smallish', 'doses', 'alternative', 'bands', 'end', 'eposode', 'original', 'Crow', 'film', 'based', 'get', 'see', 'rockstar', 'Draven', 'sing', 'perform', 'Dacascos', 'excels', 'there', 'too.This', 'series', 'subtle-', ""n't"", 'hit', 'head', 'things', 'dialogue', 'simple', 'yet', 'effective-', 'sum', 'up', 'absorbing', 'moves', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'tears', 'cheering', 'good', 'guys', 'just', 'splendid', 'inspiring', 'price', 'intend', 'buy', 'backup']",N/A

I was so shocked and happy to see that this series is finally being released on dvd. I had actually looked for it last year, because my tapes (taped from the tv, not a release) of the season were getting run down and basically in bad condition. Normally, I wouldn't flip through the TV Guide, but I did and found the little insert about The Crow: Stairway to Heaven being brought to dvd! I was amazed that it took so long because of the loyal cult following that the Crow movies started. They knew they would have buyers, so I really didn't get why it took as long as it did.The show of course revolves around Eric Draven, very much like the movie, and his many friends. The show only lasted for a season and a half, being abruptly taken off after only five episodes into season two, I believe it was that many. Anyways, if you liked the movie, you are sure to like this series. Its got martial arts, drama, danger, intrigue, and all that good stuff. Also the dvd includes many bonus features including commentary from Marc Dacascos(?), and creator Bryce Zabel. There are outtakes as well it seems, and behind the scenes of at least one or two episodes. All in all, I think they are giving fans what they want with this five-disc set.**Update**I just recieved my copy in the mail today and right now I'm watching the first episode. The quality of the dvds is excellent, and the picture is crisp and clear. The extras include (as found on the back of the box): Commentary on Episodes 1 & 2 by Mark Dacascos and Bryce Zabel, The Show's Gag Reel, The Production dailies for ""Death Wish,"" ""Dead to Rights,"" and ""A Gathering Storm;"" The Original Score, Photo Gallery, Mark Dacascos Biography, Inside Kung-Fu Magazine articles, The Pilot Script, All 22 Episode Scripts, The Original Episode Descriptions, The Show's Bible, and Tv Guide Crossword Puzzles.Discs 1-4 contain five episodes each, while disc 5 has the final two.

1063623,A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I,B000OCY7OO,Veil_Lord,"[3, 3]","I think the title I gave this review sums it up.  The story is about a guy who is thrown from a window by some goons who then assault and kill his girlfriend.  He comes back as a Crow to right the wrongs.  Watch the the first episode, figure out the plot, factor in the overdone pining for a lost love, and this show should have been complete garbage.  It should have been, but it really is quite a gem, easily on par with McGyver episodes.Maybe what makes it is that some of the scenarios in the show are just perfectly done, like the trial where he's accused of killing his girlfriend because he can't account for where he's been the past year (he was dead), which if you think about it makes real life sense.  What would the cops do if they found somebody a a double homicide, prounced them dead, buried them, then the person shows up again a year later?True, there's more than a couple bad episodes and a few things that make no sense whatsoever, but all in all, this is a very enjoyable show with likable characters.
