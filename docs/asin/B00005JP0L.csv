Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon have great chemistry and banter with each other, what is kinda weird is that Hudson ended up having a relationship with Owen Wilson after this movie was released?! And now she's dating Lance Armstrong and he has a cameo in this film, even weirder? Wilson's acting has never been spectacular but his dopey charm is sort of refreshing. Michael Douglas seems out of place, he's so unlikeable in this one! The film is a bit slow for a comedy, the laughs are few but I enjoyed watching You, Me and Dupree, check it out sometime!",4,Carl-ness.,1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,618,"['Me', 'Dupree', 'cute', 'slightly', 'vulgar', 'comedy', '2006', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'banter', 'other', 'what', 'kinda', 'weird', 'Hudson', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'relationship', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'now', 'dating', 'Lance', 'Armstrong', 'cameo', 'film', 'even', 'weirder', 'Wilson', 'acting', 'never', 'been', 'spectacular', 'dopey', 'charm', 'sort', 'refreshing', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'place', 'so', 'unlikeable', 'one', 'film', 'bit', 'slow', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'are', 'few', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Me', 'Dupree', 'check', 'out', 'sometime']",N/A

I try to watch this movie at least once a year in the summertime to enjoy myself. And everyone should have that one go-to comedy movie, that they can enjoy. This one happens to be mine.The only unfortunate thing about this movie, is that one of the film's main plot-points involves Lance Armsrtong's heroic tale of winning the Tour de France seven times, and that being Dupree's main motivation for deciding to get his life back on track. Of course this movie came out years before Lance was disqualified from those races and banned from cycling for life for admitted use of doping, and becoming one of the most disgraced athletes of all time.I don't know why people were expecting some groundbreaking movie that would change cinema as we know it. It's just a movie to have a good time with, and get in a few laughs. This is not a movie to taken seriously. This is a movie where you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy a beer or two. We need movies like that.Now I will admit, Dupree isn't for everybody. And if you don't like Dupree, then you won't like this movie. Dupree is basically every Owen Wilson role, all wrapped up into one. But overall, this movie should get you a good 10-20 laughs, and give you a nice feeling at the end.",5,A movie to enjoy and have a good time watching.

Things happen, and a few minutes later, it doesn't matter that they've happened. You sit there and watch 108 minutes of meaningless, witless anecdotes that involve the same people, but have no real bearing on their lives.As far as the characters go, they really aren't characters, and they really don't go anywhere. We never learn how Carl and Molly met, or why they love one another other than that they have sex a lot. Carl says stuff like, ""Molly is the best thing that's ever happened to me,"" but we see no proof of it. Dupree is a little eccentric, but it's all been done before. I don't know anyone in real life who is as boring as the rest of the characters with the exception of Carl's father-in-law, Mr. Thompson (Michael Douglas). But neither Dupree nor Thompson perform with enough absurdity to make the movie work.The movie is too long and unfunny to be a comedy. And it's not that I'm opposed to body humor, it's that the movie doesn't even try to be funny for huge segments. I laughed with the rest of them when Dupree broke up Carl and Molly's intimacy because of his emergency with the ""crapper."" The movie needs more of that, instead of trying to sustain drama and characters that aren't there.Once, I felt that the movie was actually taunting me. Owen Wilson watches a clip from Roman Holiday, a film starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. As he and I saw that clip, I thought to myself, ""Why am I not watching that?!""

645091,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B00005JP0L,Bill Garrison,"[4, 6]","You, Me and Dupree is a romantic comedy released in the summer of 2006 starring Owen Wilson, Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon. In marketing campaigns, the movie tried to capitalize on the popularity of Wilson from the hit movie the Wedding Crashers. Watching it at home on DVD, I laughed out loud maybe once. While this movie isn't the blockbuster it hoped to be, it is amusing and worth a look.Carl and Dupree are best friends. When Carl marries Molly, Dupree is fired from his job for taking a week off for the wedding. Now homeless, Carl agrees to let Dupree live with them for awhile. Hilarious hijinks ensue as Dupree manages to perform every irresponsible, jeuvinile act possible. Meanwhile, Carl (a solid performance by Matt Dillion) is being screwed around by his boss (an aging Michael Douglas), who happens to be Molly's father.  While the callous disrespect from Dupree grates on the married couple, the couple also grows apart because Carl is spending so much time at work.The plot brings several minor conflicts into play. Will Carl survive his job, will Molly forgive Carl? Will either forgive Dupree? Will Dupree ever become a responsible adult?While not hilarious, the movie has some good points. The cast is strong. Kate Hudson is beautiful. Matt Dillon is sophisticated and great at showing his character slowly lose it. Wilson is nothing new in this film. Seth Rogan from Knocked Up is funny as a supporting character who is controlled by his wife.This is a movie that had all the puzzle pieces for a great summer comedy.

And of course, the fly in the ointment, the husbands Childhood best friend Dupree played by Owen Wilson.  First off let me say that Kate Hudson finally seems able to project a good deal of the likability that her mother, Goldie Hawn, has in spades, and even though she had a supporting role in this movie she was the most enjoyable part.Matt and Kate's characters get married in Hawaii, Matt's best friend Owen Wilson is late because he somehow managed to fly to the wrong island.  This sets him of to be the loveable buffoon.  Michael Douglas, looking strangly smooth skinned gives a castrating speech about his daughters new husband at the wedding.They go home, move into a beautiful house and then Matt finds out that Dupree was fired from his job for going to his wedding....because Dupree didn't bother to tell his boss he was going.  MAtt, for some weird reason feels guilty, lets him move in.  Now this is where movies really lose me, this is supposedly his BEST friend, yet he comes in, changes their answering machine, orders HBO on their cable, messes up the house etc... and nothing is said to him.  Nobody would have trouble telling their best friend that they are behaving like an idiot.On to the father.  The father doesn't like the fact that his daughter has gotten married, he asks MAtt Dillions Character if he would take his wifes name, Since he owns the company, the then has the nameplate on Matt's door CHANGED to reflect his wife's last name, and then asks him to get a vasectomy.  Matt's character tells his wife he doesn't think her father likes him.  When she asks ""Why?"" he hems and haws and says ""He has never asked me to go fishing with him""  That was it, the movie totallylost me, in that situation most men would either stay quiet or tell their wives what is going on.  If you bring up to your wife that you are having trouble with her father, who is your boss, why would you FORGET to tell her that the reason you feel this way is that the guy asked you to get a vasectomy?  The wife then, rightly so, thinks her husband is being somewhat of an idiot because in her opinion, he is having problems with her father because her dad has never invited the guy fishing.  Additionally, the father keeps making him stay late at work and she is getting mad at him for missing dinner, yet he never tells her that the father is the one responsible.

It also cracked me up at the part where Matt Dillon's character Carl tells Dupree that what he did in the bathroom and how he made Molly clean up his mess was absolutely disgusting. The other funny parts in the movie is where Molly catches Dupree masturbating while he is sleeping downstairs and he makes a mess on her face!Dupree is temporarily living at Carl and Molly's residence and chilling on their couch until he finds a place of his own, and makes life a total 'mess' for them (he can't stay still for one minute without getting in their way) that they have to kick him out of the house when he brings people over and accidentally burns their couch down. Even after they kick him out, Molly feels sorry for him and see him get drenched in the rain and agrees to take him again. Carl thinks Dupree is falling in love with Molly and is trying to steal her away from him, and believes Molly's dad Mr. Thompson (played by Michael Douglas) is totally on Dupree's side and wants the marriage to fall apart.

Some zany antics courtesy of Dupree make the first part of the movie very amusing, not hilarious, but there were some laugh out loud moments.Everyone knows or has known a Dupree, that friend that sort of floats through life without any direction, but has a bigger than life personality.  This movie had a lot of potential to be a fun comedy, centering on Dupree's spirit and sense of fun; somewhere after the first 1/2 of the movie, the script took a turn for the worse.  Suddenly we are no longer watching a comedy; we are watching a drama, a very predictable and cheesy drama. (You'll want wine and crackers when consuming all this movie cheese.)The detour is led by Carl's boss and Molly's father, played by Michael Douglas.  He is pretty much your stereotypical jerky father in law wanting to hang on to daddy's little girl.  He does whatever he can to make Carl miserable at the office.  The work tension and pressures end up bringing problems home, bringing the unnecessary drama and cheese into the film.The acting was good; everyone owned their roles, I have no complaints there.

So let's dispense with formalities and call this film what it is:  contrived, silly, predictable, stereotyped, formulaic, nut jub ending, and annoying.  When Owen Wilson is good, he's downright fun to watch; when he's bad, you want to put your foot through the flat screen.  Thank goodness for self-control, or I would be looking for a new 32-inch.Yeah, yeah, yeah, newlyweds Carl and Molly (Matt Dillon and Kate Hudson) make a colossal mistake inviting Carl's deadbeat, immaturish best bud Dupree (Wilson) off the street and into their home.  And we have the subplot of Carl going to work for Molly's overbearing, boorish, obnoxious, and highly disapproving father (Michael Douglas).  Dupree is a walking catastrophe, so everything goes wrong, from stopped up toilets to setting the living room on fire, thereby creating (surprise!) a noticeable strain on Carl and Molly's marriage.  And not only is Wilson annoying as accident-prone Dupree; he's in-your-face annoying, over the top times ten.  Meanwhile stressed-out Carl becomes even more paranoid dealing with the office and home, while Hudson's Molly just stands around looking ticked off.  Then we move to a reconciliation of all parties (never saw that coming), followed by an ending so goofy I was cringing with embarrassment vicariously for Wilson.  The only bright spot was, predictably, Seth Rogen.In summary, do you want to see an entertaining, interesting, compelling, engaging, witty, charming comedy?  Then do not see YOU, ME AND DUPREE.--D.

645107,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005JP0L,Doug Anderson,"[2, 2]","Its hard to believe that Owen Wilson has been around since 1994 when he made his debut in Bottle Rocket. In the 12 years that this 38 year old has been acting he's been in a number of mediocre, or worse (often much worse), films...and yet HE's always funny and memorable. YOU ME AND DUPREE is pretty much what you would expect from a summer comedy that is meant to be funny but also generic enough to bring in huge amounts of cash. Really all three actors do what they are hired to do: Kate Hudson is super cute and sexy, Matt Dillon very competently performs his role as slightly uptight and square-jawed professional, and Owen Wilson is the eccentric charmer who saves both Kate and Matt's marriage as well as this movie from just falling asleep because its premise is so trite. If that premise and those stars neatly packaged together reek of quick box-office spoils well you're not the only one who smells it. And yet Owen Wilson is funny and memorable. He has a knack for making his characters really watchable. Everything Owen Wilson does as Dupree is memorable and this just makes you wish that he was in a movie that equaled his originality and his own very high level of commitment to detail; everything Wilson says and even everything he wears seems aglow with that Owen Wilson comic intelligence (which must be in the genius-visionary range). His characters are all originals even though the movies he is in are usually derivative (Wes Anderson films excepted). Owen Wilson has been in more bad movies than any other actor of his stature and yet he just keeps getting more popular because he is usually better than the movies themselves. YOU ME AND DUPREE is no exception to this rule.Admittedly this is a summer film and so you can see the summer formula written all over the trailers: young cute couple marry/grooms best friend is homeless/young cute couple invites homeless best friend to live with them/homeless friend causes strife at first but then--slight twist-- proves to be a blessing in disguise.  YOU ME AND DUPREE is formulaic but it also happens to be funny. No, this film will not be remembered throughout the ages nor beyond this summer ( how many of this summers movies will) but if you want to see a comedy YOU ME AND DUPREE is not a lemon (as so many reviewers seem to be saying).  With summer films especially you have to accept that its not that art film time of year just yet, and that the idea is entertainment. And YOU ME AND DUPREE is consistently that, entertaining.Personally, I think Owen Wilson has done his best work for his best friend Wes Anderson. As Dignan in BOTTLE ROCKET (1994) and as Ned Plimpton in LIFE AQUATIC (2004) Owen Wilson showed he was not only hilariously funny but that he was an inspired character actor. He's also funny in MEET THE PARENTS (2000) and ZOOLANDER (2001) and, of course, WEDDING CRASHERS (2005). But he seems to be an actor that has yet to really show what he can do. I suspect that he and Wes Anderson are destined to make some more classics and I look forward to those, but until then I do not feel guilty saying that I enjoy Owen Wilson even in his mediocre comedies like this one. [Interestingly enough Owen Wilson claims that he thinks of himself more as a screenwrite than an actor: his credits include BOTTLE ROCKET, RUSHMORE & ROYAL TANNENBAUMS; all of which he co-wrote with Wes Anderson.]YOU ME AND DUPREE is not what I'd call an inspired comedy but it has some inspired moments and, yes, most of those are provided by Owen Wilson. This is probably what you'd call an Owen Wilson vehicle. But Kate Hudson, Matt Dillon, and Michael Douglas are all excellent as well. Michael Douglas seems to especially relish his role as the impossible-to-please stepfather and even though he's not an actor that I usually care for, he was perfectly cast and fun to watch in this film. Kate Hudson is actually a very strong actress who can play both dramatic and comedic roles equally well, and Matt Dillon has never given a bad performance. Both Kate and Matt should have been given more to do instead of just providing set-ups for Owen, but their presence is appreciated and make this film better than it otherwise would have been. It will probably be a huge hit on DVD.Owen Wilson was the best part of the film and he is good all the way through. But I can't help imagining how this film could have been better. The most obvious way to improve a comedy like this one is to have more than one character capable of grabbing our attention and keeping it. Both Kate and Matt can deliver when given interesting, multi-dimensional parts, and they could have given Owen more to do had they been given more interesting characters to work with. Another possible way to improve this film I think would have been to trash the formulaic buddy- picture-gone-bad script and spend more time in Hawaii where the picture begins. Had they stayed with the Hawaiian location and concentrated more on the wedding I think this could have been a much more inspired kind of chaotic character comedy along the lines of Robert Altman's A WEDDING (though with far fewer characters). As it is the film leaves Hawaii and the wedding  and settles much too quickly into being just another comedy about a newlywed couple coping with those life changes that come with marriage (careers, in-laws, suburbia, unemployed best friend). I suppose what I'd really like to see is Owen Wilson working with more interesting directors with more ambitious scripts. I think he'd be perfect for an Altman film as both are known for being improvisers who enjoy allowing characters and story to find their own very unformulaic shape (also both Altman and Owen Wilson love the seventies and they could do a very twisted re-make of an off-beat seventies film like FIVE EASY PIECES). Ok maybe I'm just dreaming...Until then YOU ME AND DUPREE will keep Owen Wilson fans interested and wanting to see more from this actor.",3,Say Hello To My Little Friend,1153440000,"07 21,

645108,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JP0L,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 7]","Any movie that has its doofus protagonist deify Audrey Hepburn can't be completely bad, but this 2006 comedy is a movie that can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to be, moving from slapstick to sentimentality and back again with little sense of continuity. Co-directed by brothers Joe and Anthony Russo, the plot has a formulaic premise in having newlyweds Carl and Molly Peterson face the unwelcome prospect of best man Randy Dupree as a houseguest for an indeterminate time. Dupree is, of course, the guest from hell, but he is not the only pain point for the young couple since Molly's father, a smarmy corporate real estate developer, is also Carl's boss. Let the shenanigans begin, including a derivativeMission: Impossible-style take-off and a fantasy sequence with Lance Armstrong.Mike LeSieur's screenplay is not without comic invention, especially around Dupree's zen-like behavior amid his beer-guzzling slacker tendencies, including a fiery night of passion (literally). The primary problem is how the characters shift dramatically to meet the contours of the plot turns to the point where they just come across as cartoonish despite the cast's best efforts. As Dupree, Owen Wilson (Wedding Crashers) has played variations of this character so often in the past that he is unable to deepen the character in any significant way here. He has his expected funny moments, but his more dramatic scenes ring false. Matt Dillon's Carl degenerates from a well-meaning husband to a desperately jealous lout, but the transformation happens in such a haphazard way that it's hard to track our feelings for the character. As generically endearing as she can be, Kate Hudson has the least to do here and seems to be channeling her mother Goldie Hawn to get a fix on Molly's passiveness.In a role that calls for Alec Baldwin's more natural comic abilities, Michael Douglas probably fares worst as Molly's blowhard father, and his subplot feels like a wedged-in afterthought. Seth Rogen (Knocked Up) shows up in random scenes as Carl and Dupree's whipped married friend Neil. All in all, it's lightweight entertainment for the undemanding, but there is no getting around the feeling that the movie feels like an extended sitcom pilot. The 2006 DVD inexplicably has two separate commentary tracks - one with the co-directors, the other with LeSieur and producer Scott Stuber. There is an alternate ending, several outtakes, eight deleted scenes, an amusing spoof trailer and a scrapbook feature called ""Dupree's Memoirs"", which provides an unnecessary backstory to the feckless character.",2,Extended Sitcom Sputters Out Quickly Despite the Cast's Best Efforts,1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,2591,"['movie', 'doofus', 'protagonist', 'deify', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'bad', '2006', 'comedy', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'be', 'moving', 'slapstick', 'sentimentality', 'back', 'again', 'little', 'sense', 'continuity', 'Co-directed', 'brothers', 'Joe', 'Anthony', 'Russo', 'plot', 'formulaic', 'premise', 'having', 'newlyweds', 'Carl', 'Molly', 'Peterson', 'face', 'unwelcome', 'prospect', 'best', 'man', 'Randy', 'Dupree', 'houseguest', 'indeterminate', 'time', 'Dupree', 'course', 'guest', 'hell', 'not', 'only', 'pain', 'point', 'young', 'couple', 'Molly', 'father', 'smarmy', 'corporate', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'also', 'Carl', 'boss', 'Let', 'shenanigans', 'begin', 'including', 'derivativeMission', 'Impossible-style', 'take-off', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'Lance', 'Armstrong.Mike', 'LeSieur', 'screenplay', 'not', 'comic', 'invention', 'especially', 'Dupree', 'zen-like', 'behavior', 'beer-guzzling', 'slacker', 'tendencies', 'including', 'fiery', 'night', 'passion', 'literally', 'primary', 'problem', 'how', 'characters', 'shift', 'dramatically', 'meet', 'contours', 'plot', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'come', 'across', 'cartoonish', 'cast', 'best', 'efforts', 'Dupree', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'played', 'variations', 'character', 'so', 'often', 'past', 'unable', 'deepen', 'character', 'significant', 'way', 'here', 'expected', 'funny', 'moments', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'ring', 'false', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Carl', 'well-meaning', 'husband', 'desperately', 'jealous', 'lout', 'transformation', 'such', 'haphazard', 'way', 'hard', 'track', 'feelings', 'character', 'generically', 'endearing', 'can', 'be', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'least', 'do', 'here', 'be', 'channeling', 'mother', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'get', 'fix', 'Molly', 'passiveness.In', 'role', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'more', 'natural', 'comic', 'abilities', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'probably', 'worst', 'Molly', 'blowhard', 'father', 'subplot', 'feels', 'wedged-in', 'afterthought', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'up', 'random', 'scenes', 'Carl', 'Dupree', 'whipped', 'married', 'friend', 'Neil', 'lightweight', 'entertainment', 'undemanding', 'getting', 'feeling', 'movie', 'feels', 'extended', 'sitcom', 'pilot', '2006', 'DVD', 'inexplicably', 'two', 'separate', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'co-directors', 'other', 'LeSieur', 'producer', 'Scott', 'Stuber', 'alternate', 'ending', 'several', 'outtakes', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'amusing', 'spoof', 'trailer', 'scrapbook', 'feature', 'called', 'Dupree', 'Memoirs', 'unnecessary', 'backstory', 'feckless', 'character']",N/A

And there is.I'm not an Owen Wilson fan, but I was pleasantly surprised by ""The Wedding Crashers."" I thought Matt Dillion was great in ""Something About Mary,"" so the expectation was the we might be getting the best of both worlds in ""You, Me, and Dupree."" However, Wilson as Dupree comes across as a pitiful, irritating loser, while Dillion plays it straight almost the entire movie. Kate Hudson, as Dillon's new wife, is fairly easy on the eyes, while Michael Douglas, in yet another questionable movie role, plays it one-dimentional as Hudson's father, Dillion's father-in-law/boss, making every attempt to dominate the newlywed's lives. Combine all these elements and you get...not much.You may also recall that Walter Becker and Donald Fagan from Steely Dan raised a bit of a ruckus when they claimed that the movie was based on their song ""Cousin Dupree"" from their ""Two Against Nature"" album.

Carl starts to feel like everyone likes Dupree more including his wife and his father in-law (Michael Douglas...wasted).

You know he'll drive Carl crazy just like Bob drove Richard Dreyfus crazy in What About Bob. Also Matt Dillion isn't that funny or likeable here so you don't really feel for him. Matt Dillion was so funny in There's Something About Mary that he should've been nominated. Although I admit he gets likeable at the end and starts to give a better performance once it's almost over already.I also feel that when Owen Wilson is in a movie without Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller or Jackie Chan even, he's pretty naked. No not literly. I mean he's better when he has someone to play off of. He has some funny scenes on his own here but nothing compared to his work with Vince Vaughn in Wedding Crashers.

Yes, it is sort of a new age version of Noel Coward's DESIGN FOR LIVING, but alas Kate Hudson, so wonderful in every other way, is no Lynn Fontanne, and she can't seem to achieve whatever it is the two directors asked her to do, mainly, to convey her shifting moods as sometimes she seems to prefer Wilson to Dillon, at other times it's like she's never heard of such an outrageous thing.  Nevertheless occasional stabs at a menage a trois break through the suburban surface of the plot, notably when Wilson rushes through the newlyweds' bedroom, breaking up an embrace which leaves Matt Dillon's boxer shorts noticeably tented (through the use of some newfangled movie prop I'm sure, like a thick rubber shuttlecock), or the scene in which Kate stumbles over Owen ""going to town on himself,"" while the latter watches a hot number from Matt's Asian porn collection, which had been stored in a big cardboard box marked, ""Carl's Camping Equipment,"" camping indeed.  In other words the three of them are tied together in erotic ways as well as comic.  I did enjoy the post-colonial notion that Dillon's character, formerly hooked on Asian porn, has shucked his Orientalism and regrouped his stray libidinal impulses and swears he's totally into the sleek blonde American girl casualness of Kate Hudson (or Owen Wilson if it comes to that).Okay, why did Kate leave Chris Robinson for the Owen Wilson we come to know in this third-rate Owen Wilson vehicle?  I used to think he was appealing or whatever, but they've given him the Giuletta Masina treatment and he looks here as if someone pulled him out of the Canarsie sewer system.We watched this show back to back with Rene Clair's I MARRIED A WITCH (1942) and of course noticed right away the one thing they have in common: a dad who will do anything, and I mean anything, to make sure his daughter never leaves him.

645126,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JP0L,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 11]","What can you say about a movie like ""You, Me, And Dupree?""  Your first response might be, ""Man, haven't I seen this movie before?""  That's how familiar this buddy comedy will seem, it covers no new territory.  It's not a terrible film and it has some enjoyable elements, it just lacks a creativity and spontaneity that might have branded it as compelling entertainment.  As is, it's a slight and reasonably pleasant way to waste a couple of hours.  You might not remember anything about it in a week, but you might get limited enjoyment in the now.The story revolves around two college buddies.  Matt Dillon, the responsible friend, has recently married Kate Hudson, gone to work for her dad (Michael Douglas), and is trying to make a place in the ""grown-up"" world.  Owen Wilson plays the resident ""Man-child,"" a buffoon who shirks responsibility and lives in a carefree (and hopeless) state.  Conveniently, Wilson loses his place to live and so must move in with the newlyweds.  Juxtaposing Wilson's antics with Hudson's stability is the comedic center of the film, and the two battle for the attentions of Dillon.  Nothing new, huh?  Wilson is an engaging performer, and talented, but we have seen him (and dozens of others) play this exact character time and time again.  When did it become OK to continually represent 30-somethings as drifting losers?  (I don't know anyone like this.  Right out of college, sure--but 15 years later, not so much).  But he is likable, and Hudson and Dillon are likable too.  It's all so likable, if not riotously funny.I actually found most of ""Dupree"" to be a pleasant, if extremely familiar, diversion.  Having no ambitions whatsoever, the picture plays out as a genial poke at friendship and responsibility.  The performers carry the mundane story, and it unfolds as a comfortable and watchable TV sitcom plot might.  However, inexplicably, this mildly amusing endeavor goes way, way over-the top for its finale.  Shifting in tone, and for reasons unnecessary to delineate, the last act of ""Dupree"" involves Douglas as a corporate villain (a lightweight Gordon Gecko, if you will) and our pair of heroes breaking into his offices.  Turning things into an action comedy seems at odds with the rest of the picture, and the shift in tone does not serve the film well.  Nothing about this conclusion is necessary or amusing.Ultimately, ""Dupree"" is what ""Dupree"" is--a paint by numbers comedy.  Instantly recognizable, there are aspects of so many other films working here--and instantly forgettable.  I don't regret watching ""Dupree"" and I don't hate it.  It's just so unassuming, it hard to generate much passion either way.

645131,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JP0L,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 5]","The summer of 2006 saw the release of two comedies, ""You, Me and Dupree"" and ""The Break Up,"" where the tabloid coverage of the romantic relationships between the co-stars proved to be more entertaining than the movies themselves.  Here we have happy newlyweds Molly (Kate Hudson) and Carl Peterson (Matt Dillon), who return from their honeymoon and make the mistake of allowing Carl's Best Man, Randy Dupree (Owen Wilson), to sleep on their couch.  Actually Carl makes the offer without consulting Molly, so she is not pleased.  But Carl has other problems in that he is working for Molly's dad (Michael Douglas), who apparently would like his new son-in-law a lot more if Carl would just change his last name and have a vasectomy.""You, Me and Dupree"" is a fairly benign example of the Houseguest from Hell type of film.  Act I has Carl defending Dupree to Molly, Act II has Molly defending Dupree to Carl, and Act III finds Dupree making everything all right.  There is a requisite happy ending in this genre, so this will not be a surprise.  The success of such films rests on the laughter provoked by the houseguests wrecking the happy home where he has set up camp and the pathos evoked by the series of reconciliations that comprise the film's denouement.  But there are not that many laughs in the film: I think my biggest laugh came at the end when they unfroze and continued the ""final"" shot.As for achieving pathos, my problem was with the pivotal dinner scene that is the culmination of Act II.  You see, Carl has gone from dropping broad hints to coming right out and telling Molly that her dad does not like him, and his one key piece of evidence is that dad has never invited Carl on a fishing trip.  So at dinner Molly's dad invites Dupree on a fishing trip.  This is the final straw for Carl, but Molly is oblivious to what her father is doing.  This might seem like a minor point, but for me it indicates that what is happening in this film is all on the surface and once you get past that point things really start to fall apart.  This is the sort of comedy that wants to suggest behind the comedy it has a sense of heart, but I want to fault it for having the problem of the Scarecrow and not the Tin Man.However, I do want to recommend watching the film so that afterwards when you get to the DVD bonus features you can check out and enjoy the spoof trailer.  You cannot appreciate the spoof trailer unless you have seen the film and I can tell you that I laughed more at the spoof trailer than I did at the actual movie.  Now, this is not a great spoof trailer, but I certainly appreciate the attempt.  It could well be that you will think the idea of the spoof trailer (which I am making a point of not giving away) is better than the execution, but it is still a fun idea and enough to offer this rather different rationale for checking out a DVD.",3,I think you should watch the movie just so you can watch the spoof trailer,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,2869,"['summer', '2006', 'saw', 'release', 'two', 'comedies', 'Me', 'Dupree', 'Break', 'Up', 'where', 'tabloid', 'coverage', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'co-stars', 'proved', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'Here', 'have', 'happy', 'newlyweds', 'Molly', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Carl', 'Peterson', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'return', 'honeymoon', 'make', 'mistake', 'allowing', 'Carl', 'Best', 'Man', 'Randy', 'Dupree', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'sleep', 'couch', 'Actually', 'Carl', 'offer', 'consulting', 'Molly', 'not', 'pleased', 'Carl', 'other', 'problems', 'working', 'Molly', 'dad', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'who', 'apparently', 'would', 'like', 'new', 'son-in-law', 'lot', 'more', 'Carl', 'would', 'just', 'change', 'last', 'name', 'have', 'vasectomy', 'Me', 'Dupree', 'fairly', 'benign', 'example', 'Houseguest', 'Hell', 'type', 'film', 'Act', 'Carl', 'defending', 'Dupree', 'Molly', 'Act', 'II', 'Molly', 'defending', 'Dupree', 'Carl', 'Act', 'III', 'Dupree', 'making', 'everything', 'right', 'requisite', 'happy', 'ending', 'genre', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprise', 'success', 'such', 'films', 'rests', 'laughter', 'provoked', 'houseguests', 'wrecking', 'happy', 'home', 'where', 'set', 'up', 'camp', 'pathos', 'evoked', 'series', 'reconciliations', 'comprise', 'film', 'denouement', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'laughs', 'film', 'think', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'came', 'end', 'when', 'unfroze', 'continued', 'final', 'shot.As', 'achieving', 'pathos', 'problem', 'was', 'pivotal', 'dinner', 'scene', 'culmination', 'Act', 'II', 'see', 'Carl', 'gone', 'dropping', 'broad', 'hints', 'coming', 'right', 'out', 'telling', 'Molly', 'dad', 'not', 'one', 'key', 'piece', 'evidence', 'dad', 'never', 'invited', 'Carl', 'fishing', 'trip', 'So', 'dinner', 'Molly', 'dad', 'Dupree', 'fishing', 'trip', 'final', 'straw', 'Carl', 'Molly', 'oblivious', 'what', 'father', 'doing', 'might', 'seem', 'minor', 'point', 'what', 'happening', 'film', 'surface', 'once', 'get', 'past', 'point', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'sort', 'comedy', 'suggest', 'comedy', 'sense', 'heart', 'want', 'fault', 'having', 'problem', 'Scarecrow', 'not', 'Tin', 'Man.However', 'do', 'want', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'afterwards', 'when', 'get', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'enjoy', 'spoof', 'trailer', 'can', 'not', 'appreciate', 'spoof', 'trailer', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'can', 'tell', 'laughed', 'more', 'spoof', 'trailer', 'did', 'actual', 'movie', 'Now', 'not', 'great', 'spoof', 'trailer', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'attempt', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'will', 'think', 'idea', 'spoof', 'trailer', 'am', 'making', 'point', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'better', 'execution', 'still', 'fun', 'idea', 'enough', 'offer', 'rather', 'different', 'rationale', 'checking', 'out', 'DVD']",N/A

The story revolves around Molly and Carl (Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon), a pair of newlyweds who return from their honeymoon and end up with an unexpected houseguest: Carl's unemployed best friend, Dupree (Owen Wilson). Dupree is 36 going on 15, and he quickly makes himself feel at home in Molly and Carl's house. Unfortunately for everyone, Dupree feels a bit TOO comfortable in his new surroundings. He stinks up Molly's bathroom, invites over a couple of girls dressed in dominatrix gear, and sets the house on fire while having sex in his friends' living room. Poor Carl finds himself torn between his buddy and his wife, but ultimately sides with Molly after the fire department has to be called. Carl is also under a lot of stress at work (he's employed by Molly's slightly maniacal father, played by Michael Douglas), and when Molly takes pity on Dupree and invites him to return to the house, Carl turns on his friend, believing that Dupree is making a play for his wife. All's well that ends well, though, as Dupree finally connects with his ""mothership"" and manages to save the day.The cast of this movie is great, and there are some really funny moments in this film.

645159,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JP0L,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[24, 52]","At one point in ""You, Me and Dupree"", Dupree (Owen Wilson) states ""I was such a sucker."" Well, I feel the same way Dupree, I feel the same way. I was a sucker to pay $10.75 to watch this lame ""comedy""; directed by the Russo Brothers who worked on the television show ""Arrested Development"". I still don't understand how ""Dupree"" can be called a comedy.Dupree's best buddy, Carl (Matt Dillon, a long way from ""Crash"", Matt, a long way) is getting married to his sweetheart... Honestly, I have completely blanked on her character's name, that's how interesting she is. Kate Hudson's character. What was her name? Oh well, for the purpose of identification, we'll call her Blank. So Carl is marrying Blank whose father, Mr. Thompson (Michael Douglas), a rich land developer, is also Carl's boss and he's less than thrilled to welcome the new man into the family. Returning home from their honeymoon, Carl and Blank find Dupree is homeless and offer to let him stay with them for a few days. Soon, Dupree is making a general nuisance of himself; he walks in on Blank and... what was his name, the Matt Dillon character? Oh, well... For purposes of identification, we'll call him Mr. Blank. Dupree walks in on Mr. and Mrs. Blank having sex. He sleeps on their couch in the nude. He overflows their toilet. He adds HBO to their cable. He changes their answering machine. During this time, Mr. Blank begins to get pressure at work from his boss and new father-in-law, putting a strain on the relationship between the newlyweds, Mr. and Mrs. Blank.""You, Me and Dupree"" lists Owen Wilson as one of the film's many producers and this clearly appears to be an attempt to cash in on some of the success of ""Wedding Crashers"", much like Vaughn has just done with ""The Break-up"". While I pretty much disliked every frame of ""The Break-Up"", ""Dupree"" is worse. At least in ""The Break-Up"" you could identify what they were trying to do. It just didn't work. In ""Dupree"" it is almost impossible to tell if they wanted to make a comedy and if so did they want the comedy to be raunchy and slightly `out there' like ""American Pie"" or ""Wedding Crashers"" or did they want it to be a comedy like ""When Harry Met Sally""? Or were they going for a drama and if so did they want to make a flat out romantic drama or where they trying to combine drama and romance?Wilson plays a character we have seen many, many times; the unwanted house-guest. In this role, the comedy comes from the many ways this house-guest disrupts the life of his host; the more outrageous the behavior, the funnier the film. Usually. The comedy has to build from small offenses to the more outrageous. In ""Dupree"", Dupree pretty much overstays his welcome in about twenty minutes of screen time. When you see what he has done to these people, what offenses he has perpetrated, remember them, Mr. and Mrs. Blank, you will wonder how the film can continue, as I did. And it doesn't. What the filmmakers do is start the second installment of the series. In tonight's episode, Dupree has to make his buddy jealous by making Mrs. Blank more interested in him. Then when that runs its course, episode 3: The father in-law. Episode 4: The Inevitable Reconciliation. Unfortunately, none of these bits has any comedy or drama; it is merely a painful exercise and it was exhausting to keep my eyes glued to the screen as the actors wade through this mess of a film.Wilson is usually a dependable comic, but in ""Dupree"", he doesn't take the character to that next level. Yes, Dupree is lazy, can't hold a job, wanders through life at his own speed, etc. We see these actions, perhaps find it amusing, but it doesn't then lead to anything else, which makes them all the more meaningless and unfunny. They really don't have any connection to the story either, making the entire idea pointless and tiring. His character is merely a set of behaviors with no cohesion. Why does he do what he does? Is he really that oblivious? Why does he suddenly and immediately decide to go on a date with one of Mrs. Blank's colleagues? Nothing about Dupree ever gels. And after a while, his character becomes more and more... and more annoying. We keep waiting for the payoff and it never comes.Matt Dillon plays Carl, Dupree's best buddy. There is only one point when he even seems to like Dupree, to show him any real affection, and this happens very early. Throughout the rest of the film, he seems annoyed, sad, incredulous and unhappy with his relationship with Dupree. Why is he putting up with this behavior?Dillon is not particularly known for his comedic timing and he proves to be an unusual choice for this role. He seems to take everything with the seriousness of a Shakespearean actor, never really understanding the film is meant to be a comedy. His facial expression rarely changes and when it does, it goes from shocked to angry and back to shock. Its sad to watch an actor who has recently done such great work, in last year's ""Crash"", follow it up with films like ""Herbie: Unloaded"" and ""You, Me and Dupree"".Kate Hudson also plays everything very straight. At one point, she has a discussion with Dupree about how she is having trouble with her relationship with Carl, how he is always coming home late, seems stressed by the job, etc. As this is supposed to be a comedy, I kept waiting for the punch line. But then I realized this was another misguided attempt by the filmmakers to create a credible drama. But ""Dupree"" is supposed to be funny, you know, a comedy. I can honestly say she never appears to have a moment of levity. It is a boring performance that might have fared better if the film were supposed to be a drama. Considering how much of the material seems to have been created for a drama, maybe that is what the filmmakers intended. Maybe the studio got it wrong.Of all the performers, Michael Douglas is perhaps the hardest to figure out. As Mr. Thompson, he runs a large residential property development business, the type that sets up large tracts of homes called The Oaks at Playa Vista in a spot that was formerly desert. Carl, his new son-in-law is also an employee. After he returns from his honeymoon, Carl learns he has been promoted. Thompson likes his idea for The Oaks, but wants to make it even bigger, and without any trees. Carl struggles with the idea for a moment before giving in due to the promise of a lot of family names. Mrs. Blank is his only child. Thompson begins to work his son-in-law to the bone. At one point, he mentions that he wants Carl to take his name, with a hyphen, to help extend his line. Yet, in the same conversation, he suggests to Carl that he should have a vasectomy. Huh? It doesn't make any sense. Actually, this is a good example of the problem with the entire film. Everything is at odds with everything else. Characters do things and then immediately do things that don't make any sense, don't grow homogenously out of the previous action. After watching this happen repeatedly, it becomes a bit maddening.Really, I was just shocked at how bad ""You, Me and Dupree"" was. I feel cheated, like the studio owes me some money, not just for the full price ticket, but also for my time, my parking, my impaired brain function.",1,"""Dupree"" Is The Second Worst Film Released

Then there's a incredulous reaction by Kieth and his buddy Duncan.  That reaction is exactly what yours will be about thirty minutes into 'You, Me and Dupree' (if you can actually make it through that amount of time).I asked my wife about a hour into this mess exactly what this movie was about and exactly what was happening...she couldn't really tell me.  The only real reason to watch it to it's conclusion is to play a game called, 'I Want To See If I Can At Least Crack A Smile At ONE Moment'.  It never happened.Owen Wilson is a guy who has no drive or ambition in life.  Matt Dillon and Kate Hudson get married and take Owen (Dupree) into their house because he loses his job and is kicked out of the bar he's been sleeping at.  Dupree is a bad house guest who sets living rooms on fire and plays a little too much with the neighborhood kids.  Dillon and Hudson are very annoyed (just like anyone in the audience with a attention span higher than a eight month old). so they kick him out.  They take him back in and then they like him.  Then Dillon and Hudson's marriage goes into the dumpster and....yeah.  I don't really know what's going on...still.  Honestly...WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS FEATURE PRESENTATION???This film is a complete and total mess.  It is a rare treasure in that it has not one single redeeming quality to it.  Not even Kate Hudson's cute face can offer any type of entertainment value.I read a few of the reviews where the word 'hilarious' was used multipe times.

645162,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JP0L,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Suppose you are Carl, newly-married male office worker, whose wife is Kate Hudson or someone as cute as Kate. Actually Carl is played by Matt Dillon and you might say Kate Hudson is not the kind of woman you really dream of as your partner, but let's not talk about it. Now, your old friend Dupree shows up before you and your wife, saying that he lost his job and has no place to go. What would you do? And don't forget Dupree is played by Owen Wilson.You may accept him as a guest or give him some money and turns him back. You got only two choices and whichever way you may choose, you don't have much to tell in your story. However, ""You, Me and Dupree"" tries to prolong its thin story by not only letting Dupree's move into your house and live like a slacker, but also wrecking havoc on your married life. Even with Owen Wilson's comic talent, which I admit is considerable, the film is tedious, taking long time to tell us what it can with 15 minutes.I didn't find ""You, Me and Dupree"" totally unfunny. But the film still lacks direction, and characters (or actors) don't know what they really want to do. Gags are mostly repetitious and predictable, something related to toilet or television, and they might have worked with some other media such as TV sitcoms where the story can be told in much shorter time. Michael Douglas as Carl's overbearing father-in-law may be curiously attractive to some, but most of us would think, ""Why should we care?""Actually we should care more about the characters and the failing relations between Carl and Molly (that's Kate Hudson's character), but few of us would. The film could have used more effectively the old, but still interesting themes like the conflict between friendship and wedded life, or responsibility and free spirit, but it never happens. Carl should stand up and say what he should say, but instead he ruins the dinner party with his childish delusion of jealousy, which is not funny to see. When he finally does it, it comes with slapstick gags like cat-and-mouse chase in his company, something seen somewhere else before.Harry Dean Stanton and Lance Armstrong appear as cameo.",2,"Despite Owen Wilson's Comic Talent, ""Dupree"" Looks Like One TV Episode Extended Too Much",1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,2142,"['Suppose', 'are', 'Carl', 'newly-married', 'male', 'office', 'worker', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'someone', 'as', 'cute', 'Kate', 'Actually', 'Carl', 'played', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'might', 'say', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'not', 'kind', 'woman', 'really', 'dream', 'partner', 'let', 'not', 'talk', 'Now', 'old', 'friend', 'Dupree', 'up', 'wife', 'saying', 'lost', 'job', 'place', 'go', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Dupree', 'played', 'Owen', 'Wilson.You', 'may', 'accept', 'guest', 'give', 'money', 'back', 'got', 'only', 'two', 'choices', 'whichever', 'way', 'may', 'choose', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'tell', 'story', 'However', 'Me', 'Dupree', 'prolong', 'thin', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'letting', 'Dupree', 'move', 'house', 'live', 'slacker', 'also', 'wrecking', 'havoc', 'married', 'life', 'Even', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'comic', 'talent', 'admit', 'considerable', 'film', 'tedious', 'taking', 'long', 'time', 'tell', 'what', 'can', '15', 'minutes.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Me', 'Dupree', 'totally', 'unfunny', 'film', 'still', 'direction', 'characters', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'Gags', 'are', 'mostly', 'repetitious', 'predictable', 'something', 'related', 'toilet', 'television', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'other', 'media', 'such', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'where', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'much', 'shorter', 'time', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Carl', 'overbearing', 'father-in-law', 'may', 'be', 'curiously', 'attractive', 'most', 'would', 'think', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'Actually', 'should', 'care', 'more', 'characters', 'failing', 'relations', 'Carl', 'Molly', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'character', 'few', 'would', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'effectively', 'old', 'still', 'interesting', 'themes', 'conflict', 'friendship', 'wedded', 'life', 'responsibility', 'free', 'spirit', 'never', 'Carl', 'should', 'stand', 'up', 'say', 'what', 'should', 'say', 'instead', 'dinner', 'party', 'childish', 'delusion', 'jealousy', 'not', 'funny', 'see', 'When', 'finally', 'slapstick', 'gags', 'cat-and-mouse', 'chase', 'company', 'something', 'seen', 'somewhere', 'else', 'before.Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Lance', 'Armstrong', 'appear', 'cameo']",N/A
