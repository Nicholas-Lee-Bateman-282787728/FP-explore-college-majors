259737,AMJ6UC5QAZND6,6301648528,Agathoklis,"[0, 0]","Strikingly photographed, made by John Ford during his best period (the thirties and the forties - John Ford falters in the fifties). Full of religious symbolism.  The director often allows the story to be told wholly by the genius of the cinematographer (Figueroa). Dialogue is sparse and at times it works like a silent movie. This movie, like Tobacco Road, a totally different movie, illustrates the a versatile genius of John Ford who the world often sees as a director of westerns. See also The long Voyage Home for ersatiliyty (or The Hurricane). Note the characterization of the &#34;gringo&#34; and that of the policeman (Armendariz). These are not cliched, straight forward characters. The policeman thinks that he is acting for the good of his people as he persecutes the priest and the &#34;gringo&#34; ends up trying to assist the fugitive and ends up getting killed himself.I wonder why this movie gets bad reviews or is dismissed by critics. Probably because they perceived it as being religious and against the left which was fashionable at the time. They are wrong. This is not about the left nor the right. Its theme is about persecution and hope that are universal issues.Don't miss it.",5,Excellent forgotten movie,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,1203,"['Strikingly', 'photographed', 'made', 'John', 'Ford', 'best', 'period', 'thirties', 'forties', 'John', 'Ford', 'fifties', 'Full', 'religious', 'symbolism', 'director', 'often', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'wholly', 'genius', 'cinematographer', 'Figueroa', 'Dialogue', 'sparse', 'times', 'silent', 'movie', 'movie', 'Tobacco', 'Road', 'totally', 'different', 'movie', 'versatile', 'genius', 'John', 'Ford', 'who', 'world', 'often', 'director', 'westerns', 'See', 'also', 'long', 'Voyage', 'Home', 'ersatiliyty', 'Hurricane', 'Note', 'characterization', '34', 'gringo', '34', 'policeman', 'Armendariz', 'are', 'not', 'cliched', 'straight', 'forward', 'characters', 'policeman', 'acting', 'good', 'people', 'priest', '34', 'gringo', '34', 'up', 'trying', 'assist', 'fugitive', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'himself.I', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'bad', 'reviews', 'dismissed', 'critics', 'Probably', 'perceived', 'being', 'religious', 'left', 'was', 'fashionable', 'time', 'are', 'wrong', 'not', 'left', 'right', 'theme', 'persecution', 'hope', 'are', 'universal', 'issues.Do', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A

259741,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6301648528,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[10, 10]","As noted by other reviewers, this 1947 Henry Fonda film is about a priest in an anonymous Latin American country ""100 miles either north or south of the equator,"" who is trying to avoid detection by Socialist/Communist authorities who have outlawed religion.  They have apparently also outlawed every alcoholic beverage other than beer, making even a surreptitious communion difficult.This is a starkly symbolic story that makes the priest into a Christ figure, and it is lovely to watch.  Director John Ford teamed with famed Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa for this American/Mexican production, and the results are visually stunning.  And Ward Bond, as a fleeing bank robber, manages perhaps the most believable death scene ever performed in this era of film.The narrative, however, is harder to swallow.  The dialogue is minimal, probably at least partly because it was intended for an international audience.  It's hard to believe that the priest is always instantly recognized by the people on the streets but never by the authorities until the end of the film, even when they have him in custody more than once and have a photograph of him.  And the film's final scene, following the climax, did nothing but confuse me.  Ultimately I had to search the internet just to find explanations of what the film was all about!  Of course, that could be partly because it's so slow that I fell asleep at one point.  (Why did filmmakers used to think that films about faith had to move at the regal pace of a papal processional?)Despite its obvious flaws, it is an uplifting story and is worth seeing once, at least.  Clearly this is one that will appeal greatly to those who especially appreciate the visual artistry that is lovingly and painstakingly presented here; those who look for a cohesive story may be disappointed as I was.",3,Very pretty but confusing,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,1839,"['noted', 'other', 'reviewers', '1947', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'film', 'priest', 'anonymous', 'Latin', 'American', 'country', '100', 'miles', 'either', 'north', 'south', 'equator', 'who', 'trying', 'avoid', 'detection', 'Socialist/Communist', 'authorities', 'who', 'have', 'outlawed', 'religion', 'have', 'apparently', 'also', 'outlawed', 'alcoholic', 'beverage', 'other', 'beer', 'making', 'even', 'surreptitious', 'communion', 'difficult.This', 'starkly', 'symbolic', 'story', 'priest', 'Christ', 'figure', 'lovely', 'watch', 'Director', 'John', 'Ford', 'teamed', 'famed', 'Mexican', 'cinematographer', 'Gabriel', 'Figueroa', 'American/Mexican', 'production', 'results', 'are', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'fleeing', 'bank', 'robber', 'perhaps', 'most', 'believable', 'death', 'scene', 'ever', 'performed', 'era', 'film.The', 'narrative', 'however', 'harder', 'swallow', 'dialogue', 'minimal', 'probably', 'least', 'partly', 'was', 'intended', 'international', 'audience', 'hard', 'believe', 'priest', 'always', 'instantly', 'recognized', 'people', 'streets', 'never', 'authorities', 'end', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'have', 'custody', 'more', 'once', 'have', 'photograph', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'following', 'climax', 'did', 'nothing', 'confuse', 'Ultimately', 'had', 'search', 'internet', 'just', 'find', 'explanations', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'course', 'could', 'be', 'partly', 'so', 'slow', 'fell', 'asleep', 'one', 'point', 'Why', 'did', 'filmmakers', 'used', 'think', 'films', 'faith', 'had', 'move', 'regal', 'pace', 'papal', 'processional', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'uplifting', 'story', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', 'least', 'Clearly', 'one', 'will', 'appeal', 'greatly', 'who', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'visual', 'artistry', 'lovingly', 'painstakingly', 'presented', 'here', 'who', 'look', 'cohesive', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'was']",N/A
259742,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301648528,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 2]","""The Fugitive"" is a 1947 black and white drama about the Cristero War in Mexico (1926-9) in which the government suppressed the practice of religion and in which thousands of people were killed, including priests. The film was adapted from the 1940 novel by Graham Greene (1904-91).This was the fifth of seven collaborations of director John Ford and actor Henry Fonda. In his long career John Ford (1894-1973) won 4 Oscars (""The Quiet Man"", ""How Green was my Valley"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""The Informer"")  and was nominated for ""Stagecoach"". He had 3 DGA nominations and 1 win and 4 wins by the New York Film Critics.Henry Fonda (1905-82) won one Oscar (""On Golden Pond"") and was nominated for 2 more (""12 Angry Men"", ""Grapes of Wrath"") plus 3 Emmy nominations and 2 Golden Globe nominations. He stars as the last priest left alive in his region of Mexico, hunted by the police and sought by the peasants to perform his priestly duties. Unfortunately this is one of his worst ever performances and he spends most of the movie like a Zombie priest.The great Pedro Armendariz (1912-1963) plays a lieutenant who is after Fonda. Armendariz appeared in more than 100 films, from 1935 to 1963. Most of his films are Spanish language, but he appeared in dozens of US films, the most memorable of which are ""Fort Apache"" (1947), ""The Littlest Outlaw"" (1956), and ""From Russia with Love"" (1963). He won 2 Silver Ariel awards and was nominated 4 more times.Ward Bond (1903-60) appears as a ""Gringo"" fugitive, but he is in very few scenes. Bond was a staple in Ford's stock company and appeared in ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939), ""Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)"", ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and ""The Grapes of Wrath (1940) among the 25 films they made together. He's probably best remembered for his role as Major Seth Adams on the TV series ""Wagon Train"" (1957 - 1961), based on the 1950 film ""Wagon Master"" in which he appeared. Bond was in more Top 100 AFI films (7) than any other actor, and appeared in 11 films that were nominated as Best Picture.Dolores del Rio (1904-83) was a famous Mexican movie star who also made a mark in the U.S. She started in the silent era in 1925, and between 1946 and 1954 she won the Mexican Silver Ariel 3 times and was nominated twice more. Here she plays a woman who befriends Fonda, but who has links to Armandariz. Unfortunately Ford apparently told her to shut her mouth and look angelic, which is what she basically does through all her scenes.J. Carrol Naish was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Sahara"" in 1941, ""A Medal for Benny"" in 1946). He was extremely versatile and could play an Indian (""The Whirlwind""), a Russian (""""British Agent""), an Arab (""The Crusades""), an Asian (""The Hatchet Man"") and a Latino (""The Kid from Spain""). He played the lead role in ""Sitting Bull"" (1954). In this film Naish plays a police informer.Look for John Qualen as a Physician in a rehab center and Robert Armstrong (of ""King Kong"" fame) as a police captain.Merian Cooper (1893-1973) was the Executive Producer. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), one of several films he made with John Ford and John Wayne (""The Searchers"", ""Rio Grande"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", ""Fort Apache""). His other notable films include ""King Kong"" (1933), ""The Lost Patrol"" (1934), and ""Wagon Master"" (1950). John Ford called Cooper his favorite producer. Among his other talents, Cooper was a pioneer in stop motion animation, Technicolor, and Cinerama as well as a war hero, an aviation pioneer, and one of the first real life documentary makers.Richard Hageman did the musical score. Hageman won the Oscar for ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and was nominated 4 other times. He worked on several Ford films including ""The Long Voyage Home"" (1940), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949) and ""Wagon Master"" (1950). While his work is usually quite good, in this film the music is oppressive.About the only element the film has to recommend it is the fine photography from Gabriel Figueroa (1907-97). Figueroa was nominated for an Oscar (""Night of the Iguana"") and won 8 Mexican Oscars as well as a Golden Globe. The use of dark and shadows is reminiscent of Ford's work in ""The Informer"" (1935).Not only is the acting poor and the music oppressive, the editing is terrible. In the middle of the action, when Bond and Fonda are being hunted by Armandariz, we suddenly get a scene 5 years in the future at a rehab facility, and then we are whisked back into the present day. Very strange indeed.Bottom line - certainly an important subject, and well photographed, but the terrible acting, the heavy handed symbolism, and the oppressive music make this film a burden to watch.FWIW - People interested in the Cristero War might want to look at ""For Greater Glory""",2,"Poor film, important topic",1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,4789,"['Fugitive', '1947', 'black', 'white',

He comes to grip with his greatest need when he observes, ""at the end there was only one thing that counted - to be a saint.""  Though the film adaptation necessarily lacks a great deal of this character development of the novel, it is still a moving reminder that hate can never ultimately conquer faith.",4,Fair adaptation of the classic novel,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,931,"['film', 'fair', 'adaptation', 'Graham', ""Greene'sThe"", 'Power', 'Glory', 'Penguin', 'Classics', 'story', 'fugitive', 'priest', 'Mexico', 'infamous', 'Calles', 'Law', 'period', 'used', 'draconian', 'methods', 'suppress', 'religious', 'freedom', 'particularly', 'Catholicism', 'Mexico', 'laws', 'led', 'Cristeros', 'war', 'recreated', 'new', 'film', 'summer', 'Greater', 'Glory', 'reason', 'good', 'time', 'revisit', 'classic', 'film.The', 'novel', 'great', 'deal', 'shortcomings', 'main', 'character', 'how', 'maturing', 'faith', 'redemptive', 'suffering', 'flight', 'police', 'grip', 'greatest', 'need', 'when', 'end', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'counted', 'be', 'saint', 'film', 'adaptation', 'necessarily', 'great', 'deal', 'character', 'development', 'novel', 'still', 'moving', 'reminder', 'hate', 'can', 'never', 'ultimately', 'conquer', 'faith']",N/A

As if bowdlerizing the point out of Graham Greene's source material to make a plaster saint of his hero wasn't bad enough, Henry Fonda's mostly dreadful performance is the final nail in the coffin. Ford always managed to get the very least out of Fonda, and here Hank's clearly plain embarrassed by the part, proving woefully ineffective as he fails to make much of an impression for far too much of the running time. With all traces of character removed from the role, leaving him with nothing to work with, it's not until the last couple of reels that he actually becomes a remotely credible character instead of a poorly drawn walking religious icon - ""Hey, look everybody, I'm suffering for your sins just like Christ!"" Until then, it's up to Pedro Armendariz to hold the fort as the policeman who has replaced religion with a new faith, politics, although even his missionary faith in atheism is somewhat undermined here by Fonda's nameless priest being a sober believer rather than the drunken fallen angel of the novel. Along with Ward Bond's Gringo bank robber (bizarrely introduced with the theme from Stagecoach!), he's one of the few people Fonda encounters on his journey to martyrdom you can actually care about or believe in. Certainly Dolores Del Rio's Madonna/Whore figure is so horribly idealised that it feels like being beaten up by a posse of boxing nuns every time she appears in `God-light.'There are a few good scenes and a strong ending, but the horrible overindulgence of much of the film - like the endless treacle of the opening baptisms - is almost enough to make the Pope convert to Judaism. Compared to this, The Passion looks subtle.
