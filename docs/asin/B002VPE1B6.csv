Nevertheless, I'd like to add my voice to help give this movie the praise it deserves, and to counter the negative reviewers, who are apparently in a mood to be hypercritical, are right-wing hardliners, and/or are inappropriately rating the Blu-Ray package rather than the movie itself.For me, this movie goes well beyond simply being a movie.  Rather, it's like a voyage to another world which is, at the same time, oddly familiar.  True, many of the characters are closer to caricatures, but that approach works in this movie because it brings into focus the distinct messages of each character, and the characters together cover a reasonably diverse spectrum of types.  In other words, the elements of this movie are simple, but they're woven together in a complex way which is emotionally powerful and thematically profound.  In particular, the theme which jumped out to me most prominently was the overt similarity to the culture, spirituality, and history of the Native Americans (and other indigenous groups around the world), except that the Native Americans obviously met with a much sadder ending.  To the extent that viewers missed this theme (very few reviews mention it), that's an unfortunate reflection of our society's lack of knowledge regarding both history and the oppression and exploitation going on in the world today.On a more technical note, of course the tremendous visuals and special effects are vital to making this voyage possible.  The Blu-Ray is excellent in this regard, with a clarity and vividness which almost surpasses reality, but seeing the movie in 3D in the theater is also an experience not to be missed.Needless to say, I very highly recommended this movie.  This is one of only a handful of movies that I've ever purchased rather than rented.  Cynics will point to the amount of profit this movie is generating but, in this case, it's arguably well deserved.",5,Momentous,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,2015,"['nearly', '1,500', 'reviews', 'having', 'been', 'posted', 'date', 'perhaps', 'everything', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'movie', 'Nevertheless', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'voice', 'help', 'give', 'movie', 'praise', 'counter', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'apparently', 'mood', 'be', 'hypercritical', 'are', 'right-wing', 'hardliners', 'and/or', 'are', 'inappropriately', 'rating', 'Blu-Ray', 'package', 'rather', 'movie', 'itself.For', 'movie', 'well', 'simply', 'being', 'movie', 'Rather', 'voyage', 'world', 'same', 'time', 'oddly', 'familiar', 'True', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'closer', 'caricatures', 'approach', 'movie', 'focus', 'distinct', 'messages', 'character', 'characters', 'together', 'cover', 'reasonably', 'diverse', 'spectrum', 'types', 'other', 'words', 'elements', 'movie', 'are', 'simple', ""'re"", 'woven', 'together', 'complex', 'way', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'thematically', 'profound', 'particular', 'theme', 'jumped', 'most', 'prominently', 'was', 'overt', 'similarity', 'culture', 'spirituality', 'history', 'Native', 'Americans', 'other', 'indigenous', 'groups', 'world', 'Native', 'Americans', 'obviously', 'met', 'much', 'sadder', 'ending', 'extent', 'viewers', 'missed', 'theme', 'very', 'few', 'reviews', 'mention', 'unfortunate', 'reflection', 'society', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'regarding', 'history', 'oppression', 'exploitation', 'going', 'world', 'more', 'technical', 'note', 'course', 'tremendous', 'visuals', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'vital', 'making', 'voyage', 'possible', 'Blu-Ray', 'excellent', 'regard', 'clarity', 'vividness', 'almost', 'reality', 'seeing', 'movie', '3D', 'theater', 'also', 'experience', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Needless', 'say', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'movie', 'one', 'only', 'handful', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'purchased', 'rather', 'rented', 'Cynics', 'will', 'point', 'amount', 'profit', 'movie', 'generating', 'case', 'arguably', 'well', 'deserved']",N/A
1295589,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,B002VPE1B6,J. O. Booker,"[3, 21]","IMO, the success of Avatar has hurt films by helping to lower expectations and attention spans. I ask myself how films like Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus, Ben Hur, The Red Shoes, Scenes from a Marriage, Ran, La Dolce Vita, even Vertigo or Citizen Kane would be received by today's filmgoer or for that matter if those type of films would have even been made if gimmicks like CGI and 3d had been around then?It's impossible to spoil this film because it's been done so many times. Here's what it's about in a nutshell: Soldier infiltrates alien tribe. Becomes one of them. Kills ugly bird. Tames giant multicolored bat. Falls in love with alien girl.Has second thoughts about mission. Switches sides. Becomes leader of tribe, helps them fight off greedy humans. The end.I told you you've seen it before, but, unlike Cameron's past films which always had little surprises at the end, the average filmgoer who's not a total moron can see how this'll end in the very beginning as soon as he hears Jake Sully's voice over, a la Harrison Ford's voice over in Bladerunner that this film, especially the director's cut, makes obvious reference to. The draw to see this film is not what, as in what happens, but in how, as in how they show this film, which is the best use of 3d in any film done since. The biggest problem with this film is that it leaves no room for me to decide what I want to think. This is about as black and white as you can get. The aliens, modeled after all cultures that were overrun and exploited by western civilization, are totally innocent and good, and the despoilers, the earthlings, are totally greedy and evil. in other words, the characters were too one-dimensional for me to care anything for. So when the film kicks into high gear and when the good guys and bad guys started going at it, I didn't care who won but who really cared because it just looked really cool anyway.I've noticed a sharp dropoff in quality American films in the last 2 decades since the emergence of cgi. Thank goodness for foreign films although I wonder how much pressure they are under to dummy down their films with gimmicks to get their movies seen over here. The actors are even getting worse, nowadays who needs to act? Just ask Vin Diesel, the Rock, Cameron Diaz, etc. Really, the main draw of going to see today's film is to have stuff thrown at you for 2 hours.And another thing: Cameron was wrong! 3d has not ""changed the world."" In fact, in case anyone hasn't noticed it, the only movies done (and will be done) in 3d are dumb braindead summer movies. That's right. Can you see someone 30+ going to see, let's say, The Godfather in 3d!!!; Citizen Kane, The Red Shoes, Dr. Zhivago, The Ice Storm, M, The French Connection, Belle Du Jour, Schindler's List, The Battle of Algiers, Battleship Potompken, Bladerunner, etc., (whew) in 3d? Can you imagine directors like Clint Eastwood (who seemingly has no taste for 3d), Pedro Amoldovar, the Coen brothers, Peter Greenaway, etc., alienating their fans by coming out with a 3d movie? And I'd hope that by the time someone hit their 30's they'd look to something more substantial to draw them into a film. I guess next they'll come up with 3d literature, like popups, words that pop off the page.Lastly I want to say this: while I did enjoy Avatar as entertainment, I hope that it never receives recognition for being one of the great films in some future list. That would be a tragedy and a sad commentary on human evolution in my opinion, that we're moving back down the ladder.

When I watch this story I felt like I was watching a 1990 western illustrating how badly the Indians were treated over 100 years ago and other similar stories. This movie was so predictable that to me it was a rerun.  Almost all the technical details was left out to explain why humans were still living under a military rule and the only way to solve a problem is to kill all the men involved.  I did notice that when they went into battle all the women from earth seem to disappear.  So, I give this movie a 1 star because of the amazing special effects.

1295594,A3V43IU15LA3HA,B002VPE1B6,snow47,"[1, 2]","This is for the 3-Disc DVD Extended Collector's Edition. I have not even watched either of the two alternate extended versions of the film yet, but even at that it is worth five stars, and can only get better. This set is beautifully contained in a slipcase hardcover book-style package. As someone who loves real, tactile objects, I like this very much, and feel compelled to put it on a bookshelf or something. One other nice thing is the availability of an alternate ""family friendly"" audio track that is sans-profanity. That is a rarely seen but very nice, inclusive touch.There is really not much that I could say to add to what has already been said about this film. In terms of the official Amazon product review above, I am one of those people who sees the characters as, ""broad, useful archetypes."" Yes, the plot is simple, relatively unsurprising and not a story that hasn't been told before. And yes, the message is very overt. But it is all executed clearly and concisely. So many films that I have seen lately end up as train wrecks of convoluted or unfullfilled thematic ambitions. I realize that for some people, Avatar's very deliberate method and occasionally blunt-force symbolism (""unobtainium"") are not the ingredients of a great film. For me, though, it is a very powerful story that is told very effectively.The other element, of course, is the visual one. I do not know if I have ever seen anything so incredibly awe-inspiring. Beautiful, gorgeous, ominous, obviously otherworldly. This is a film where James Cameron and company went all-out to create the most immersive sensory experience that had ever been onscreen. This is something completely different from a standard ""effects blockbuster"" movie. Even the music is perfectly in sync to the environment. And the greatest beauty is how it all serves the story. These aren't visual effects for the sake of saying, ""hey, look what we can do.""
