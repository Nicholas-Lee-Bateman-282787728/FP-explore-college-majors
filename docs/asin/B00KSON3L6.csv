1697395,A1WVA7V02PQOY6,B00KSON3L6,Dad of Divas,"[2, 2]","My wife and I have enjoyed watching this series. At first we were a bit skeptical because we had watched the pilot prior to the series and liked the actors in that, only to find that the actors had been changed in the series. As we got into the series though we ended up falling in love with the characters and the writing. The series is well written and directed with strong acting and characterization. This DVD really brings you into the series and you get to see the start of some of the love that begins between Elizabeth and Jack as well as a catch when Billy comes on the scene. The two episodes were fun and engaging and leave you wanting to watch more, or at least they did for my wife and I. All-in-all this was a well done DVD, and I for one am looking forward to the next season!*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*",5,A Great DVD and a Great Series!,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,845,"['wife', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'series', 'first', 'were', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'had', 'watched', 'pilot', 'prior', 'series', 'liked', 'actors', 'only', 'find', 'actors', 'had', 'been', 'changed', 'series', 'got', 'series', 'ended', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'characters', 'writing', 'series', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'strong', 'acting', 'characterization', 'DVD', 'really', 'series', 'get', 'see', 'start', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'Jack', 'as', 'well', 'catch', 'when', 'Billy', 'scene', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'fun', 'engaging', 'leave', 'wanting', 'watch', 'more', 'least', 'did', 'wife', 'I.', 'All-in-all', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'DVD', 'one', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'season', '*I', 'received', 'review', 'opinions', 'are', 'own*']",N/A

More so when there's a triangle.  That's just what is created when Billy Hamilton comes to town to mine.  I don't know about you, but I think that a man reciting poetry is very romantic.  Jack and Elizabeth struggle to communicate with each other while Billy smoothly speaks sweet poetic words that spark Elizabeth's attention and Jack's suspicions and jealousy.I love how expressive the actors and actresses are in this film.  I think we'd understand the plot even if it weren't a &#34;talkie&#34; but a silent film.  As usual, there are some words of wisdom shared within the lines of the story as well as some good advice.This is the fourth in the series that I've viewed.  The first had different actors.  Of the films with the second set of actors, this one is my favorite.  Perhaps it is because I've become accustomed to Coal Valley and its people.  This is a very enjoyable movie.  It's clean enough for the whole family, romantic enough for those who enjoy that, and it has action for those who like that.  My whole family enjoyed it.",4,"Expressive acting, words of wisdom, good clean film.",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1117,"['Thank', 'Edify', 'Media', 'review', 'copy.Love', 'complicated', 'matter', 'More', 'so', 'when', 'triangle', 'just', 'what', 'created', 'when', 'Billy', 'Hamilton', 'town', 'mine', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'man', 'reciting', 'poetry', 'very', 'romantic', 'Jack', 'Elizabeth', 'struggle', 'communicate', 'other', 'Billy', 'smoothly', 'sweet', 'poetic', 'words', 'spark', 'Elizabeth', 'attention', 'Jack', 'suspicions', 'jealousy.I', 'love', 'how', 'expressive', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'film', 'think', ""'d"", 'understand', 'plot', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", '34', 'talkie', '34', 'silent', 'film', 'usual', 'are', 'words', 'wisdom', 'shared', 'lines', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'advice.This', 'fourth', 'series', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'first', 'had', 'different', 'actors', 'films', 'second', 'set', 'actors', 'one', 'favorite', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'Coal', 'Valley', 'people', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'clean', 'enough', 'whole', 'family', 'romantic', 'enough', 'who', 'enjoy', 'action', 'who', 'like', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoyed']",N/A

After researching I see that this is an original series based on the bestselling books by Janette Oke.When Calls The Heart, the series is about the story about Elizabeth Thatcher a young teacher who beginning a new chapter in her life in a 20th century coal mining town.In this DVD When Calls The Heart The Dance a group of miners descend on the town and The Dance part of the title is Miss Thatcher and the other woman in town throwing a dance to welcome the miners. It appears that there was a mining accident that took the lives of the men of the town leaving many of the woman to count on each other for support.  It also appears that the town's lone law enforcer is a Canadian Monty named, Jack Thornton. He has an obvious crush on Miss Thatcher but so does one of the new miners. A suave miner with a penchant for poetry, Mr. Billy Hamilton takes a liking to Miss Thatcher and she is definitely interested in his debonair ways that she almost forgets she actually likes Mr. Thornton who is only worried about her safety with the unfamiliar Hamilton. While these two gentlemen try to win over Miss. Thatcher. The other woman are dealing with trying to get their lives back in order after the mining accident.Some are dealing with children who miss their daddies and won't mommy to move on with a new miner, others are dealing with pregnancy and trying to pay for food now that their men are gone.In the midst of all this newness and attempt to get life back in order after the accident, there have been robberies in town and Monty Jack Thornton must find out who is to blame.What I loved about this was that the show was very family oriented. It reminded me of Little House on the Prairie without the child stars. My favorite character is played by &#34;Becky&#34;Lori Loughlin who plays Abigail Stanton, a wife and mother whose husband was the foreman of the mine and was killed in the explosion.Season 2 will begin shooting in August and I now wish I had the Hallmark Channel so I could catch up on Season 1 and watch Season 2.If you love shows like Dr. Quinn, Little House on the Prairie, or just love the Hallmark Channel shows you will undoubtedly love this series.I personally love the clothing and how everyone leaned on each other during these times. You needed your friends and neighbors to survive and you could count on them.",4,When Calls The Heart Is A Beautiful Series,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,2462,"['Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'TV', 'so', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'When', 'Calls', 'Heart', 'DVD', 'researching', 'see', 'original', 'series', 'based', 'bestselling', 'books', 'Janette', 'Oke.When', 'Heart', 'series', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'Thatcher', 'young', 'teacher', 'who', 'beginning', 'new', 'chapter', 'life', '20th', 'century', 'coal', 'mining', 'town.In', 'DVD', 'When', 'Heart', 'Dance', 'group', 'miners', 'descend', 'town', 'Dance', 'part', 'title', 'Miss', 'Thatcher', 'other', 'woman', 'town', 'throwing', 'dance', 'welcome', 'miners', 'was', 'mining', 'accident', 'took', 'lives', 'men', 'town', 'leaving', 'many', 'woman', 'count', 'other', 'support', 'also', 'town', 'lone', 'law', 'enforcer', 'Canadian', 'Monty', 'named', 'Jack', 'Thornton', 'obvious', 'crush', 'Miss', 'Thatcher', 'so', 'one', 'new', 'miners', 'suave', 'miner', 'penchant', 'poetry', 'Mr.', 'Billy', 'Hamilton', 'liking', 'Miss', 'Thatcher', 'definitely', 'interested', 'debonair', 'ways', 'almost', 'actually', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'who', 'only', 'worried', 'safety', 'unfamiliar', 'Hamilton', 'two', 'gentlemen', 'try', 'win', 'over', 'Miss', 'Thatcher', 'other', 'woman', 'are', 'dealing', 'trying', 'get', 'lives', 'back', 'order', 'mining', 'accident.Some', 'are', 'dealing', 'children', 'who', 'miss', 'daddies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mommy', 'move', 'new', 'miner', 'others', 'are', 'dealing', 'pregnancy', 'trying', 'pay', 'food', 'now', 'men', 'are', 'midst', 'newness', 'attempt', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'order', 'accident', 'have', 'been', 'robberies', 'town', 'Monty', 'Jack', 'Thornton', 'must', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'blame.What', 'loved', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'family', 'oriented', 'reminded', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'child', 'stars', 'favorite', 'character', 'played', '34', 'Becky', '34', 'Lori', 'Loughlin', 'who', 'Abigail', 'Stanton', 'wife', 'mother', 'husband', 'was', 'foreman', 'mine', 'was', 'killed', 'explosion.Season', '2', 'will', 'begin', 'shooting', 'August', 'now', 'wish', 'had', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'could', 'catch', 'up', 'Season', '1', 'watch', 'Season', '2.If', 'love', 'shows', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'just', 'love', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'love', 'series.I', 'personally', 'love', 'clothing', 'how', 'everyone', 'leaned', 'other', 'times', 'needed', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'survive', 'could', 'count']",N/A

Based on the novels from best-selling author Janette Oke and combining the writing talents of Michael Landon Jr., you get an amazing story of life on the frontier for school teacher Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) in the small mining town of Coal Valley. Even though viewers know the feelings between Miss Thatcher and Canadian Mounty, Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing) has been sparking since the very beginning both of them maintain their proper boundaries from one another.In the DVD release of When Calls the Heart: The Dance, we know see the small town coming back to familiar routines and one of them being the Miner games, which is hosting by the entire town for the miners and their families. As the mine ramps back up to full operation since the mining explosion that killed most of them men and their sons in Coal Valley, a new load of miners arrives at the mine. We now see, Billy Hamilton, a charismatic and handsome miner take interest in Miss Thatcher and he isn't afraid to let her know his is interested, even quoting romantic poetry he claims as his own. Even though Elizabeth has reservations about his methods, she isn't about to wait on Jack forever to make his feelings known. But Jack warns Elizabeth not to be so trusting, without him investigation Billy Hamilton more fully. Elizabeth just thinks Jack is jealous.Some of the other women in town seem to be interested in the miners as well. But when a string of robberies begin to hit the town, Jack feels that he knows who the criminal is and sets up a trap to capture Billy Hamilton in the act. He attempts to show Elizabeth that the information he has on Billy proves his is hiding something and if she doesn't watch out she may lose more than just her heart. So who is hiding the biggest secret of all in Coal Valley? Viewers of When Calls The Heart: The Dance, will have to pick this one up to find out!I received When Calls the Heart: The Dance compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Group for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for an honest review and the opinions contained here are strictly my own. Not since Little House on the Prairie has there been a series until When Calls the Heart and if you loved the Little House Series or simply love a great family series set in the Old West, then you will LOVE this one. I easily give this a 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait for the next season to air on the Hallmark Channel. Fans of Love Come Softly will absolutely LOVE this one as well. The chemistry between Elizabeth and Jack is so strong it won't take much to light these two on fire and that is part of the appeal as well as the love Elizabeth brings to school the children of Coal Valley in the town's saloon to teach them there is more to life than working in the mines.",5,Best series for families young and old!!!,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,2946,"['are', 'looking', 'incredible', 'family', 'series', 'appropriate', 'entire', 'family', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'When', 'Heart', 'Based', 'novels', 'best-selling', 'author', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'combining', 'writing', 'talents', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'get', 'amazing', 'story', 'life', 'frontier', 'school', 'teacher', 'Elizabeth', 'Thatcher', 'Erin', 'Krakow', 'small', 'mining', 'town', 'Coal', 'Valley', 'Even', 'viewers', 'know', 'feelings', 'Miss', 'Thatcher', 'Canadian', 'Mounty', 'Jack', 'Thornton', 'Daniel', 'Lissing', 'been', 'sparking', 'very', 'beginning', 'maintain', 'proper', 'boundaries', 'one', 'DVD', 'release', 'When', 'Calls', 'Heart', 'Dance', 'know', 'see', 'small', 'town', 'coming', 'back', 'familiar', 'routines', 'one', 'being', 'Miner', 'games', 'hosting', 'entire', 'town', 'miners', 'families', 'mine', 'back', 'up', 'full', 'operation', 'mining', 'explosion', 'killed', 'most', 'men', 'sons', 'Coal', 'Valley', 'new', 'load', 'miners', 'arrives', 'mine', 'now', 'see', 'Billy', 'Hamilton', 'charismatic', 'handsome', 'miner', 'take', 'interest', 'Miss', 'Thatcher', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'let', 'know', 'interested', 'even', 'quoting', 'romantic', 'poetry', 'own', 'Even', 'Elizabeth', 'reservations', 'methods', ""n't"", 'about', 'wait', 'Jack', 'forever', 'make', 'feelings', 'known', 'Jack', 'Elizabeth', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'trusting', 'investigation', 'Billy', 'Hamilton', 'more', 'fully', 'Elizabeth', 'just', 'Jack', 'jealous.Some', 'other', 'women', 'town', 'seem', 'be', 'interested', 'miners', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'string', 'robberies', 'begin', 'hit', 'town', 'Jack', 'who', 'criminal', 'up', 'trap', 'capture', 'Billy', 'Hamilton', 'act', 'show', 'Elizabeth', 'information', 'Billy', 'hiding', 'something', ""n't"", 'watch', 'out', 'may', 'lose', 'more', 'just', 'heart', 'who', 'hiding', 'biggest', 'secret', 'Coal', 'Valley', 'Viewers', 'When', 'Calls', 'Heart', 'Dance', 'will', 'have', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'received', 'When', 'Calls', 'Heart', 'Dance', 'compliments', 'Word', 'Films', 'Edify', 'Media', 'Group', 'honest', 'review', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'monetary', 'compensation', 'honest', 'review', 'opinions', 'contained', 'here', 'are', 'strictly', 'own', 'Not', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'there', 'been', 'series', 'When', 'Heart', 'loved', 'Little', 'House', 'Series', 'simply', 'love', 'great', 'family', 'series', 'set', 'Old', 'West', 'then', 'will', 'LOVE', 'one', 'easily', 'give', '5', '5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'season', 'air', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'Fans', 'Love', 'Come', 'Softly', 'will', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'chemistry', 'Elizabeth', 'Jack', 'so', 'strong', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'light', 'two', 'fire', 'part', 'appeal', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'school', 'children', 'Coal', 'Valley', 'town', 'saloon', 'teach', 'more', 'life', 'working', 'mines']",N/A

It is a Hallmark movie inspired by the best selling series by Janette Oke.This DVD doesn&#8217;t go along with the book series. It tells a story of the Elizabeth from the book series niece Elizabeth.It is continuing from the first DVD when Elizabeth goes West to teach those that no one else wants to teach. In this DVD men from another town come and help run the coal mine and they have quite a few adventures. Not all of the adventures are good ones either.I really enjoyed the part when the widow Carla is close to having a baby and no one really knows how to help or deliver a baby, but it all comes together.Some things are getting stolen and some lives are changing.
