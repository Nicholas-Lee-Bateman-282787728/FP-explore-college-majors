This is NOT what fans of the best drama in the history of television have been waiting for.  I will not be buying this set and supporting Paramount with this travesty.  I'll stick to watching my collection of reruns which I taped from the original run of the series even though they are old and worn.  At least they're complete.

It would be fruitless for me to buy them when I have season 1,2,3 and 4 of TBA. I may buy the disc thinking I'm getting new TBA shows and realize there's 3 shows on the disc that i already own. I don't understand why the powers that be won't release the remaining seasons.  It is bad enough that the seasons were broken up into volumes so I paid a crazy price for 12 episodes at a time, now they want to sell 4 episodes at a time for crazy prices.  What a rip off.

CBS and Paramount has apparently dropped this idea, and will only be releasing ""collections"" of the episodes that are considered the ""best"". There are only 4 episodes on this set, 1 of which has been released on DVD already.I know I should be happy but I'm not. I assume this is for financial reasons (not like CBS and Paramount combined are hurting) and this is better than nothing but it is a lame attempt to appease the fans when nearly half of the series on DVD has been released already. Nearly every tv show known to man is being released on DVD, and they pull a stunt like this? I would say this release should not be supported, but I fear if it's not they will never release seasons of TBAA on DVD again.

I only watched maybe a two/three episodes during the original run and I'm not quite done watching season 2 but I have to say from what I have watched so far it is a great TV show, inspiring with little bits of humor. It's nice to get away from the more violent shows sometimes and watch a show that tries to lift you up, cheer you up and make people's lives better. This show reminds me HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN (also a very good show).Now as for this DVD release, what is going on? Before TV show season releases you could only buy compliation releases from Columbia House DVD and Video. That's exactly what this is, and its a ripoff. Its bad enough the 3rd and 4th seasons we're split seasons, BUT THIS IS NONSENSE. I will not pay a certain price just to get four episodes, that I may or may not have.We the consumers want FULL SEASON RELEASES OF SEASONS 5 - 9, PLEASE? If Paramount can just do that, people will fork over the money to have the episodes put out the right way. This is just a money making scheme to see what they can get out of us. Guess what, they are not getting anything out of me until I see season releases.
