But I have ordered a copy, and can't wait for it to arrive, though I understand that it's very different from the movie.I probably wouldn't have heard of the movie either, except that a friend of mine, Justin Welborn, plays one of the main characters (the Pope). So, of course, I had to support him by watching it.I had read a little bit about the movie before I saw it, but when I watched it, I truly had no expectations ~ yet somehow I was pleasantly surprised.  It's well written, well shot, well thought-out. Also, it's not a ""Christian"" movie in the traditional sense ~ it's not preachy, not a ""sales tool"", and the characters aren't perfect. They're human, and they're flawed. Which makes them more real. There's drinking, drugs, cursing, anger, pregnancy outside of marriage ~ all things that happen in the real world ~ and the world of the church (even if 'the church' chooses to ignore or deny it).The movie opens as Donald Miller is about to leave home to go to college. A Baptist college. You see, Don is a dyed-in-the-wool Southern Baptist. He's worked in a factory that makes wine cups for communion. He's been the assistant youth pastor. And he's been a good son to his single mother. He puts up with his father, who is an atheist, and who apparently did not help support Don growing up, but now offers him tuition at Reed College in the Pacific Northwest. Don of course refuses, but then finds out his mother is having an affair with the youth pastor. The married youth pastor.Feeling betrayed, Don goes to Reed, where he encounters all kinds of people ~ and begins to question his own spirituality. In fact, he whole-heartedly rejects the church and its principles, partly to fit in, and partly because of his feelings of betrayal.The first scenes of the movie, when Don is at church, are painfully accurate. I wasn't sure I'd be able to watch the movie because of my own experiences as a child in a Southern Baptist church. It made me cringe.But I kept watching, and found the rest of the movie to be a thoughtful, intelligent look at faith and spirituality, and trying to belong. It also has moments of great humor - when Don participates in ""civil disobedience"" for school credit, and he's dressed in an astronaut suit while the rest of the group are dressed as robots.The characters engaged me ~ from do-gooder Penny to lesbian Lauryn, from the Russian (who I wish we'd seen more of!) to the Pope, who's actually an atheist (played by Justin).I wasn't terribly thrilled with the animation, and like other reviewers noted, the opening scenes could have been shorter, but the rest of the movie engaged me. It made me think. It made me ponder. It made me look at my own faith.If you are open-minded, then this movie is definitely for you.

This is a movie about a young man struggling with his faith.Here's the scoop. Don Miller is a Southern Baptist in Texas. Mom and dad are divorced. Dad has applied (unbeknownst to Don) to get his son into Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Don figures to go to a Baptist college in Texas. When he finds out his mom is sleeping with their church's married youth adviser he heads for Reed where he enters a whole new world with a whole new set of challenges.This is a 'coming of age' type flick. Don thinks he's got the world pegged and his path is chosen. Here, though, he's subjected to one of the most liberal and progressive (not to mention wild and crazy) cultures in the country. His beliefs are challenged, he meets a girl who  he likes but who holds him at arms length. He dabbles in drugs and alcohol and struggles to make sense of it all. He's liking this new environment. The Jazz he listens to makes more sense. He feels freer and more alive. I guess that's why I felt cheated at the end. Given everything that's happened to him in the movie, how is it he makes the decision he makes? I simply did not believe it.There is a lot to like here. You like Don. You like seeing him break away from the narrow-minded, cloistered environment he's grown up in. You like his dad (kind of) because he wants his son to be more worldly. You feel for his mom though she seems to be her own worst enemy. All of these folks and many at the college are notable personalities. Some of the craziness is over (maybe way over) the top, and some of the discussions on religion are decent. The acting, directing, editing and music are as good as they need to be. Where this falters is in its resolve.You will like this movie more or less depending on you religious views. But it is well worth seeing.",3,If You Know You Don't Speak.

1539805,A2D0ASQY7PAJAG,B007Y6CQGE,"Jacob A. Davis ""Writer, Artist, and Theologian""","[6, 7]","A low-budget independent film by director with only one prior movie, Blue Like Jazz seeks to break every rule for so-called ""Christian"" films and instead exist as a compelling, realistic story about faith. Despite a few not-so-glaring flaws, the 2012 film Blue Like Jazz rings true, is superbly engaging, and has opened several doors for future filmmakers in the process. Based loosely on Donald Miller's 2003 book of the same name, an anecdotal series of reflections on Christian spirituality, the film almost didn't happen due to lack of interest from Christian film producers (fans of the book came to the rescue in a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign). The material contains a portrayal of life on a real college campus, which anyone who has been to college can attest is never G-rated. The lead character Don (Marshall Allman), who takes elements from Donald Miller's personality and story but is mostly non-biographical, moves from a strongly Southern Baptist Texas environment to Reed College, a highly liberal college in Portland, Oregon. His experiences adjusting to the culture shift, as well as increasing disillusionment with his home environment and family, create a crisis of faith that propels much of the film.The film doesn't seek to give all the answers, and it certainly doesn't. What it does is tell how messy searching out one's identity is, especially our faith identity. For Christians, there are times and situations that really make us doubt, question, and even reject God. There are times and situations that plunge us into a dark night of the soul. Moreover, there are situations within the church that cut us so deep it is hard to recover. I can rattle off a dozen situations easily where the sinful behavior within churches has caused certain individuals to separate themselves from Christianity, either for a time or for good. Because of this, particular moments within the film hit me with a particular sting. In critiquing the actions of some Christians, the film certainly does not glorify the socially liberal environment, either. The character called ""The Pope"" represents all that is good and downright sad about nihilistic hedonism. On the other hand, the character of Penny (Claire Holt) represents all that is seemingly good and hopeful about really living out our faith, though not without her own struggles. Both characters may seem to present, at times, oversimplified archetypes of their chosen lifestyles, and yet both characters are also very recognizable to me in individuals I have known myself.As films go, Blue Like Jazz is not a masterpiece. The production is a little shaky at times, largely due to the small budget and the fact that this is only Steve Taylor's second time directing a feature film (his first, The Second Chance, also has many commendable traits, though is leagues behind this in most aspects). There is some unnecessary animation early on that is more distracting that propelling to the storyline. Some supporting characters are dying to be fleshed out more than they end up being. However, perhaps the reason we wish to have more information on the characters is that what we do see of them is entirely compelling. Allman, Wellborn, and Holt (among others) give their characters the dedication and heart it takes to make a story about a spiritual journey believable.At the beginning of the film, Don's estranged father tells him that life is like jazz, which never resolves, but Don notes that his dad was wrong and jazz does resolve. The film resolves, too, though not in all aspects. While Don begins to reconcile with his faith, family, and friendships, we're not sure what will happen from here. This is a part of the journey, the part we see at the present. Like life, we don't see it all now. We see little vignettes of the story, but we'll never have the full picture in this life. Perhaps, in that aspect, Blue Like Jazz is most relatable of all.",4,"An Important, Engaging, Genre-Breaking Film",1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,3927,"['low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'director', 'only', 'one', 'prior', 'movie', 'Blue', 'Jazz', 'break', 'rule', 'so-called', 'Christian', 'films', 'instead', 'exist', 'compelling', 'realistic', 'story', 'faith', 'few', 'not-so-glaring', 'flaws', '2012', 'film', 'Blue', 'Jazz', 'rings', 'true', 'superbly', 'engaging', 'opened', 'several', 'doors', 'future', 'filmmakers', 'process', 'Based', 'loosely', 'Donald', 'Miller', '2003', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'anecdotal', 'series', 'reflections', 'Christian', 'spirituality', 'film', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'due', 'lack', 'interest', 'Christian', 'film', 'producers', 'fans', 'book', 'came', 'rescue', 'record-breaking', 'Kickstarter', 'campaign', 'material', 'portrayal', 'life', 'real', 'college', 'campus', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'college', 'can', 'attest', 'never', 'G-rated', 'lead', 'character', 'Don', 'Marshall', 'Allman', 'who', 'elements', 'Donald', 'Miller', 'personality', 'story', 'mostly', 'non-biographical', 'moves', 'strongly', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'Texas', 'environment', 'Reed', 'College', 'highly', 'liberal', 'college', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'experiences', 'adjusting', 'culture', 'shift', 'as', 'well', 'increasing', 'disillusionment', 'home', 'environment', 'family', 'create', 'crisis', 'faith', 'much', 'film.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'seek', 'give', 'answers', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'What', 'tell', 'how', 'messy', 'searching', 'out', 'one', 'identity', 'especially', 'faith', 'identity', 'Christians', 'are', 'times', 'situations', 'really', 'make', 'doubt', 'question', 'even', 'reject', 'God', 'are', 'times', 'situations', 'plunge', 'dark', 'night', 'soul', 'Moreover', 'are', 'situations', 'church', 'cut', 'so', 'deep', 'hard', 'recover', 'can', 'rattle', 'off', 'dozen', 'situations', 'easily', 'where', 'sinful', 'behavior', 'churches', 'caused', 'certain', 'individuals', 'separate', 'Christianity', 'either', 'time', 'good', 'particular', 'moments', 'film', 'hit', 'particular', 'sting', 'critiquing', 'actions', 'Christians', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'glorify', 'socially', 'liberal', 'environment', 'either', 'character', 'called', 'Pope', 'good', 'downright', 'sad', 'nihilistic', 'hedonism', 'other', 'hand', 'character', 'Penny', 'Claire', 'Holt', 'seemingly', 'good', 'hopeful', 'really', 'living', 'out', 'faith', 'not', 'own', 'struggles', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', 'present', 'times', 'oversimplified', 'archetypes', 'chosen', 'lifestyles', 'yet', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'recognizable', 'individuals', 'have', 'known', 'myself.As', 'films', 'go', 'Blue', 'Jazz', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'production', 'little', 'shaky', 'times', 'largely', 'due', 'small', 'budget', 'fact', 'only', 'Steve', 'Taylor', 'second', 'time', 'directing', 'feature', 'film', 'first', 'Second', 'Chance', 'also', 'many', 'commendable', 'traits', 'leagues', 'most', 'aspects', 'unnecessary', 'animation', 'early', 'more', 'distracting', 'propelling', 'storyline', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'dying', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'However', 'perhaps', 'reason', 'wish', 'have', 'more', 'information', 'characters', 'what', 'do', 'see', 'entirely', 'compelling', 'Allman', 'Wellborn', 'Holt', 'others', 'give', 'characters', 'dedication', 'heart', 'make', 'story', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'beginning', 'film', 'Don', 'estranged', 'father', 'tells', 'life', 'jazz', 'never', 'Don', 'notes', 'dad', 'was', 'wrong', 'jazz', 'resolve', 'film', 'resolves', 'too', 'not', 'aspects', 'Don', 'reconcile', 'faith', 'family', 'friendships', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'here', 'part', 'journey', 'part', 'see', 'present', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'now', 'see', 'little', 'vignettes', 'story', ""'ll"", 'never', 'have', 'full', 'picture', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'aspect', 'Blue', 'Jazz', 'most', 'relatable']",Blue Like Jazz

At all. Luckily, we're rediscovering that Jesus wasn't a legalistic, religious dogmatist. He told them off. In this, a young man comes from such a background and is tempted to go to America's most progressive (yep, meaning all open minds, double-standards and all) campus. No real thought about it until a secret is slipped-up in church that forces his decision.While at Reed, he finds out just how sheltered his life had been. People challenge his faith in many ways (and one of the most ironically funny lines I have ever heard in a movie is said by a lesbian- ""Get back in the closet, Baptist boy!""), including an atheist posing as the Pope. Social stunts that are completely nuts and are borderline anarchic, people harboring secrets that can easily destroy Christin faith, things that are said that push real hard people in one way, challenging them in ways those who are sheltered would be jaw-droppingly shocked to hear and more. And yet, even in the midst of all the craziness, there is so much humor (wait, did that girl just use a urinal?) that I couldn't help but guffaw at it all. In the midst of the dangerous humor, witty one-liners, and faith challenges, there's also hope, even in the midst of the darkest moments.And then, the most controversial scene people have mentioned. The Campus Confession scene. I truly saw nothing wrong with it. If anything, I felt it was the most genuine, sincere confession for, not any given sinner, but a Christian to give. Starting with a thought-provoking line (""I realized I was ashamed of Jesus"") that give exposition to what Don means, the more he goes into it, the deeper the confession, the more I couldn't help but find myself agreeing (I'm currently living the Bible Belt Buckle and find myself agreeing with what Don says through and through, bringing me to tears). I felt that this should be a required viewing for Christians in high school to get a taste of how college life could be and challenge them in where they stand.Then there's the special features, both the thought-provoking/inspiring ones (like ""This is my story"") and the roll-on-the-floor-guffawing ones (the reasons for each deleted shot and the director getting each character- including a bridge and a dog- into character), this was thoroughly challenging, provoking, inspiring, enlightening, and, most importantly, insightfully enjoyable.

1539812,A2BUBB68YIE8MK,B007Y6CQGE,Nicholas Ahern,"[27, 33]","I'm good at laying my cards on the table, so I will do so right now. I didn't like the book. I generally don't find Donald Miller's writing very compelling, save for Searching for God Knows What. That said, I loved Blue Like Jazz.Beginning with a surreal (albeit) poorly paced opening of Donald Miller, played with reserve by Marshall Allman, Blue Like Jazz knows exactly where it needs to go. The film starts in Texas, at a fundamentalist church where Miller is content to simply exist without much rigorous thought. After a familial incident, Miller's perfect life is upended and he runs away into the godless Northwest United States to Reed College, where he experiences drinking, drugs, bi-curious girls and social justice. But, he cannot escape his background, or the Deity that seems to follow him.Blue Like Jazz does not equate itself to being a Christian film. This does not suggest that Christians are not involved or that there is any lack of Christian themes in Blue Like Jazz, but the nature of the film is not sermonizing. Don's encounters with various students, from a dude dressed in a Pope outfit to a girl involved in Christo-centric social justice, showcase the turmoil of a man caught in the whirlpool of messy, post-conservative Christianity in a staunchly secular and hurting world. *For a discussion on ""christian films.""I'll confess, I found this to be quite accurate in relation to my own spiritual journey. Having a personal conversation about God at midnight with an agnostic dressed as a beer can comes to mind. Blue Like Jazz touches on this sort of almost transcendental interaction, but also the failure of the church. Not in that the church, as a whole, has failed; rather, in the lives of some people pursuing truth, the church is very capable of providing invisible walls to run into. Blue Like Jazz is honest enough to not avoid the walls, but to show that they can be overcome. We see this in pastors, scholars and parents, both in reality and in this film. Blue Like Jazz never harshly condemns, but rather shows the linger effects of blind trust.The style of the film is reminiscent of Garden State, with abstract shots of astronauts in space and on earth. Director Steve Taylor, through his use of music and tone, manages to create a genuinely idiosyncratic film. However, the biggest fault of the film is the pacing, with the introduction running far too long. Not much in the way of character development, though there are attempts, until Don packs his bags for college. Once that picks up, the pacing picks up, but there are still instances that bring the film to a grinding halt. Like Don and Pope placing a giant condom on the church steeple. Funny. Necessary in regards to a certain character. But it takes far too long to set up and execute.Blue Like Jazz is a quirky little film that is filled with honest questions and a genuinely humble ending that is as far from an alter call as one can imagine. However, the ending is far more impactful and quiet than I anticipated, leaving me lost in thought for a long time. For a documentary that more actively engages with the idea, check out Lord, Save Us From Your Followers. Its on Netflix instant.In many ways, the silence and subtle shift of perspective is far more powerful than an alter call. This is where Blue Like Jazz excels. The point of it is not atonement theory or proclaiming systematic theology. This is not Wayne Grudem or Thomas Oden. This isn't even really Rob Bell or Tony Jones. In some ways, I saw a little N.T. Wright in there. However, the point overall seems to be more towards simply living as one ought to live in order for the gospel to bloom. People see the good deeds other do, and they want to know why. The point is living gospel. Helping the poor. Listening to our enemies. Empathizing with other people's failures.Possible spoiler:Don's final comments about being ""ashamed of Jesus"" ruffled some Christian's feathers. However, the context is powerful in that Don is confessing to a person who suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a powerful man of God. Being ""ashamed"" is actually the most telling sign of a truly repentant heart. Shame and guilt often showcase our fears and our reaction in tune with the Spirit. Allowing God to move in most mysterious ways.End possible spoiler.I'm ashamed of Jesus in that I constantly fail to live up to his perfect example. I'm ashamed of my own failure and the failure of those that profess belief in the same God I love. And that is the pinnacle of Blue Like Jazz. It recognizes the failure of humanity in response to the cross, and the example put forth by both king and servant, Jesus.The gospel reigns in Blue Like Jazz.3.5 out of 5.For the entire review on my

1539813,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B007Y6CQGE,Paul Allaer,"[5, 6]","""Blue Like Jazz"" (2012 release; 106 min.) is a remarkable little movie on many different levels. Marshall Allman plays Don Miller (on whose autobiography the movie is based), a Southern Baptist teenager in Houston. Miller's universe is shaken up when he finds out that his mom is having an affair with the (married) youth minister of his church. At the prodding of his far more liberal-leaning dad, Miller ends up going to Reed College, the liberal arts school in Portland, OR. Talk about a contrast! Miller tries to fit in as best he can, and also meets Penny (played by Claire Holt), to whom he is instantly attracked. Will Miller lose his religion? Will Miller win the girl? To say much more about the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out, but I will say this: there are a couple of nice twists towards the end. The campus of Reed College is almost a character in and of itself, and a number of its campus traditions play a prominent role in the story line, including its annual Renn Fayre festival. Apart from that, I thought Claire Holt was quite the eye-opener (her days on ""H2O Just Add Water"" are clearly behind her!).Apart from the movie itself, it is worth noting that the fact that the movie was even made is almost a miracle, with hoped-for investment money not coming through days before shooting was to begin. Several fans began raising money through the Kickstarter website, and long story short, enough money came through for the movie to be made (all 3000+ contributors are listed in the film credits, by the way, scrolling by very quickly). The movie made its debut just 2 months ago at the SXSW Film Festival and with almost unheard of speed/urgency, only a month later it was in the theatre (where I saw just it the other day).Last, but certainly not least, the movie features an excellent soundtrack, truly enjoyable. Most notable is the outstanding indie-rock band Menomena (from Portland, incidentally), who have 4 or 5 songs in the movie. Also featured are indie bands like Be Your Own Pet and Cincinnati's Over the Rhine, which contributes ""All I Get For Christmas Is Blue"" in an important Christmas-themed scene, as well as jazz legend John Coltrane (his album ""A Love Supreme"" plays an important role itself in the movie). To be clear: REM's ""Losing My Religion"" is NOT featured in the film, although certainly could have thematically. In all, I found ""Blue Like Jazz"" to be an unexpected, likable, quirky little movie, miles away from your standard Hollywood fare. If that sound like your cup of tea, you will injoy this movie quite a bit.",4,Losing My Religion... and other Renn Fayre stories,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2629,"['Blue', 'Jazz', '2012', 'release', '106', 'min', 'remarkable', 'little', 'movie', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'Marshall', 'Allman', 'Don', 'Miller', 'autobiography', 'movie', 'based', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'teenager', 'Houston', 'Miller', 'universe', 'shaken', 'up', 'when', 'out', 'mom', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'youth', 'minister', 'church', 'prodding', 'far', 'more', 'liberal-leaning', 'dad', 'Miller', 'up', 'going', 'Reed', 'College', 'liberal', 'arts', 'school', 'Portland', 'OR', 'Talk', 'contrast', 'Miller', 'fit', 'as', 'can', 'also', 'meets', 'Penny', 'played', 'Claire', 'Holt', 'whom', 'instantly', 'attracked', 'Will', 'Miller', 'lose', 'religion', 'Will', 'Miller', 'win', 'girl', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'couple', 'nice', 'twists', 'end', 'campus', 'Reed', 'College', 'almost', 'character', 'number', 'campus', 'traditions', 'play', 'prominent', 'role', 'story', 'line', 'including', 'annual', 'Renn', 'Fayre', 'festival', 'Apart', 'thought', 'Claire', 'Holt', 'was', 'quite', 'eye-opener', 'days', 'H2O', 'Just', 'Add', 'Water', 'are', 'clearly', '.Apart', 'movie', 'worth', 'noting', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'almost', 'miracle', 'hoped-for', 'investment', 'money', 'not', 'coming', 'days', 'shooting', 'was', 'begin', 'Several', 'fans', 'began', 'raising', 'money', 'Kickstarter', 'website', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'enough', 'money', 'came', 'movie', 'be', 'made', '3000+', 'contributors', 'are', 'listed', 'film', 'credits', 'way', 'scrolling', 'very', 'quickly', 'movie', 'made', 'debut', 'just', '2', 'months', 'ago', 'SXSW', 'Film', 'Festival', 'almost', 'unheard', 'speed/urgency', 'only', 'month', 'later', 'was', 'theatre', 'where', 'saw', 'just', 'other', 'day', '.Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'movie', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'Most', 'notable', 'outstanding', 'indie-rock', 'band', 'Menomena', 'Portland', 'incidentally', 'who', 'have', '4', '5', 'songs', 'movie', 'Also', 'featured', 'are', 'indie', 'bands', 'Be', 'Own', 'Pet', 'Cincinnati', 'Rhine', 'Get', 'Christmas', 'Is', 'Blue', 'important', 'Christmas-themed', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'jazz', 'legend', 'John', 'Coltrane', 'album', 'Love', 'Supreme', 'important', 'role', 'movie', 'be', 'clear', 'REM', 'Losing', 'My', 'Religion', 'NOT', 'featured', 'film', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'thematically', 'found', 'Blue', 'Jazz', 'be', 'unexpected', 'likable', 'quirky', 'little', 'movie', 'miles', 'away', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'sound', 'cup', 'tea', 'will', 'injoy', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit']",Blue Like Jazz

I was right. Several fictional elements have been added with the real story to make it filmable. The results are nothing short of outstanding. Everyone involved in this project should be proud. The actors were excellent. It looked to be a much bigger budgeted film than it actually was. The quality of this production should not be surprising. Director and co-writer Steve Taylor had quite a career as a performer in the 1980s and 1990s. His videos were played on Mtv which was unheard of for a Christian artist at the time. His music still is cutting edge 20 and 25 years after he recorded it. For a real treat look up Steve's ""Meltdown at Madame Tussad's"" video on Youtube.  Mostly I want to say, if you are not a Christian, you will still enjoy this film as it is a movie about people and you will not be preached at.  If you are a Christian, some of you may be offended at some of the content here but you should be glad they made a film about reality and not the one dimensional Christians that are usually depicted.

Normal ""Christian"" movies are supposed to be right wing morality tales that tug at the heart strings and are family friendly. Edgy ""Christian"" movies are supposed to be filled with lots of sex, or violence, or profanity in order to prove that they are not normal ""Christian"" movies. This film is none of the above. While not skirting sex, violence, or profanity it doesn't use any of these as a tool to prove its street cred. Just like the book which serves as its source material it is somewhat whacky and off beat, filled with quite a few unforced laughs and real life as it follows the essentially true story of a Texas church boy with a messed up family (and maybe a messed up church) trying to fit in at an Oregon college that really puts the ""liberal"" into Liberal Arts.This movie moves at a nice pace. It is well directed and edited with a solid cast. As for the ""Christian"" part, it may not please the average Evangelical church goer but it could very well sucker punch many a non church goer who thinks they are just watching a gem of a movie that was overlooked by the mainstream machine. I went to the cinema hoping to like this film because I loved the book and because my daughter has a minor role (the Aqua Babe).
