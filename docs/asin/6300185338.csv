The beauty of global retailers, like Amazon, opens the door to these films that otherwise would be lost.This is a great film with a stellar cast. Strongly recommend purchasing this, but be aware that it's in PAL format, not US NTSC.",5,A classic film that is so underrated (and next to impossible to find),1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,366,"['so', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'US', 'film', 'studios', 'release', 'wonderful', 'films', 'overseas', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'not', 'here', 'beauty', 'global', 'retailers', 'Amazon', 'door', 'films', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'lost.This', 'great', 'film', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Strongly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'be', 'aware', 'PAL', 'format', 'not', 'US', 'NTSC']",N/A

When I saw this at the theater almost 50 years ago, I thought it was fascinating. Much older and seeing it on tape about 10-15 years ago, it wasn't as interesting as I had remembered. I guess when you're a kid, everything on the big screen is impressive.Humor helped in this movie, giving it some life here and there as it's a bit slow-moving.  However,  I've usually found Curtis entertaining to watch, a man who played a lot of interesting characters. I still think he is/was an underrated actor, too.It was nice seeing the main character, although being a fake, still asking for God's help in certain situations, inside knowing he was not doing the right thing. Those parts would be edited out if the film was re-made today. Also, faking being a surgeon is not something to be laughed at, especially if he was doing his operating on you or me!",3,Another Interesting Role For Curtis,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,949,"['Tony', 'Curtis', 'Ferdinand', 'Waldo', 'Demara', 'Jr.', 'who', 'faked', 'being', 'doctor', 'warden', 'monk', 'teacher', 'When', 'saw', 'theater', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'fascinating', 'Much', 'older', 'seeing', 'tape', '10-15', 'years', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'had', 'remembered', 'guess', 'when', ""'re"", 'kid', 'everything', 'big', 'screen', 'impressive.Humor', 'helped', 'movie', 'giving', 'life', 'here', 'there', 'bit', 'slow-moving', 'However', ""'ve"", 'usually', 'found', 'Curtis', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'lot', 'interesting', 'characters', 'still', 'think', 'underrated', 'actor', 'too.It', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'fake', 'still', 'asking', 'God', 'help', 'certain', 'situations', 'inside', 'knowing', 'was', 'not', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'parts', 'would', 'be', 'edited', 'out', 'film', 'was', 're-made', 'today', 'Also', 'faking', 'being', 'surgeon', 'not', 'something', 'be', 'laughed', 'especially', 'was', 'doing', 'operating']",N/A

It is the (mostly) true story of Ferdinand Demara Jr., and his amazing career of successfully posing as a U.S. Army officer, a Navy dental surgeon, a prison warden, and several other things which he was not.  Solid support is provided by several fine character actors (Edmund O'Brien, Arthur O'Connell, Larry Gates, Raymond Massey, Karl Malden).  Slightly overlong, but well worth seeing.

The reaching out to be more than one is has often formed the staple of Hollywood.  The result is humorous more often than not.  In THE GREAT IMPOSTER, director Robert Mulligan provides a darkly comical aspect of a subject that, in this film at least, is only a hairsbreath away from tragedy.  Tony Curtis plays Ferdinand Waldo Demarra, a young man who from early childhood cannot make his own mark on the world and determines to make a series of marks by stealing the identities of more qualified others.  In a series of vignettes whose only link is to show that Demarra's quest for recognition by using the names of others whom he deems as more worthy than himself is each time an exercise in futility.  It does not matter whether he impersonates a physician, a warden, or even a police officer.  In each case, he performs flawlessly to such an extent that he is the victim of his own celebrity and talent.  When he is exposed, he moves on, shedding his previous identity before assuming a new one.  The irony is that Demarra refuses to believe the sincerity of the accolades that he truly earns.  The more his peers praise him, the more he cannot accept that praise at face value.  Nowhere in the film does he provide a meaningful rationale for his futile gropings for self-esteem.  His deficient ego is simply there, daring both himself and the audience to wonder what drives on a man who has such limitless talent at improvisation but such limited belief in his own identity as Demarra.  By the movie's end, he has gone full circle.  He has learned nothing about what fuels his desire to be someone else, and when the audience sees that he has been hired to catch himself, the humor of this irony covers a mystery that may never be revealed.",3,The Great Imposter: When Being Yourself Is Not Enough,1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,1827,"['Nearly', 'everyone', 'one', 'time', 'wished', 'be', 'other', 'who', 'are', 'reaching', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'often', 'formed', 'staple', 'Hollywood', 'result', 'humorous', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'IMPOSTER', 'director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'darkly', 'comical', 'aspect', 'subject', 'film', 'least', 'only', 'hairsbreath', 'away', 'tragedy', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Ferdinand', 'Waldo', 'Demarra', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'early', 'childhood', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'own', 'mark', 'world', 'determines', 'make', 'series', 'marks', 'stealing', 'identities', 'more', 'qualified', 'others', 'series', 'vignettes', 'only', 'link', 'show', 'Demarra', 'quest', 'recognition', 'using', 'names', 'others', 'whom', 'more', 'worthy', 'time', 'exercise', 'futility', 'not', 'matter', 'physician', 'warden', 'even', 'police', 'officer', 'case', 'flawlessly', 'extent', 'victim', 'own', 'celebrity', 'talent', 'When', 'exposed', 'shedding', 'previous', 'identity', 'assuming', 'new', 'one', 'irony', 'Demarra', 'believe', 'sincerity', 'accolades', 'truly', 'more', 'peers', 'praise', 'more', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'praise', 'face', 'value', 'Nowhere', 'film', 'provide', 'meaningful', 'rationale', 'futile', 'gropings', 'self-esteem', 'deficient', 'ego', 'simply', 'there', 'daring', 'audience', 'wonder', 'what', 'man', 'who', 'such', 'limitless', 'talent', 'improvisation', 'such', 'limited', 'belief', 'own', 'identity', 'Demarra', 'movie', 'end', 'gone', 'full', 'circle', 'learned', 'nothing', 'what', 'fuels', 'desire', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'when', 'audience', 'been', 'hired', 'catch', 'humor', 'irony', 'mystery', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'revealed']",N/A
