It came from a source that was blurry and scratched and looked like a ""Goodtimes"" video.  Really poor quality.  What a disappointment since it is my favorite Vincent Price film.  It tries to deliver, but with a poor source it's difficult.  I recently recorded a version on SHOWTIME that was distributed by Orion. WOW!!! thank goodness for recordable dvd, now this is the copy to have...perfect and crystal clear.  Why did Orion release this great source on laserdisc but not on dvd?  People, there is a crystal clear transfer out there.  Write to Orion or HBO now, since Orion has gone out of business, and ask for the release of this great film on dvd.House on Haunted Hill is an excellent transfer on this double dvd, the price is reasonable and it delivers I would give this 5 stars if it was the only film on this dvd.  But I bought the dvd thinking that the two were pristine transfers.  Anyway, enough moaning, buy this just for House on Haunted Hill.  It's worth it, instead of paying top dollar from Columbia dvd.

554980,ARFBRSE35ZJ6A,B00004WGAB,Bill W. Dalton,"[5, 6]","Whada-ya-know?  A double feature!  Just like the good old days when I was a kid, going off on a Saturday morning to see a pair of movies at the local Broadway Theater!  And what a good choice for a twin-bill.  Two classic Vincent Price outings!Haunted Hill is a typical William Castle gimmick movie.  He was famous for his hokey put-ons to promote his works.  Like wiring some of the seats in the theater to give some unlucky patrons a mild electric shock for effect in The Tingler!  Or supplying life insurance policies in case someone had a fatal heart attack while watching one of his thrillers.  The gimmick for Haunted Hill was a skeleton on a wire that floated above the audience at the critical scene!  Castle was an old-time showman, all right!Ubaldo Ragona is much less well-known, to say the least, but his version of Richard Matheson's novel, I Am Legend, is a pretty solid piece of work, with Price giving a very credible performance as a desperate man alone in a world of living-dead vampires who want him to join them in their non-death.The image quality in Haunted Hill is quite good, but there are few bonus features on this disc.  Just some mini-biographies and a short chapter index.  Unfortunately, the image quality in Last Man is not of the best and the main title credits are elongated in this full screen version of a widescreen movie.  Still. it's very watchable and enjoyable.  This DVD is a bargain at its price, and all Price fans will want to add it to their library.",3,Double Feature at the ol' Bijou!,984528000,"03 14, 2001",2001,1495,"['Whada-ya-know', 'A', 'double', 'feature', 'Just', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'going', 'off', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'see', 'pair', 'movies', 'local', 'Broadway', 'Theater', 'what', 'good', 'choice', 'twin-bill', 'Two', 'classic', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'outings', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'typical', 'William', 'Castle', 'gimmick', 'movie', 'was', 'famous', 'hokey', 'put-ons', 'promote', 'works', 'wiring', 'seats', 'theater', 'give', 'unlucky', 'patrons', 'mild', 'electric', 'shock', 'effect', 'Tingler', 'supplying', 'life', 'insurance', 'policies', 'case', 'someone', 'had', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'watching', 'one', 'thrillers', 'gimmick', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'was', 'skeleton', 'wire', 'floated', 'audience', 'critical', 'scene', 'Castle', 'was', 'old-time', 'showman', 'right', 'Ubaldo', 'Ragona', 'much', 'less', 'well-known', 'say', 'least', 'version', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'Am', 'Legend', 'pretty', 'solid', 'piece', 'work', 'Price', 'giving', 'very', 'credible', 'performance', 'desperate', 'man', 'alone', 'world', 'living-dead', 'vampires', 'who', 'want', 'join', 'non-death.The', 'image', 'quality', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'disc', 'Just', 'mini-biographies', 'short', 'chapter', 'index', 'Unfortunately', 'image', 'quality', 'Last', 'Man', 'not', 'best', 'main', 'title', 'credits', 'are', 'elongated', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'widescreen', 'movie', 'Still', 'very', 'watchable', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'bargain', 'price', 'Price', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'library']",House on Haunted Hill/The Last Man On Earth

554982,A2DE249NY4SMSN,B00004WGAB,Chad Taylor,"[6, 7]","This DVD by Diamond Entertainment is actually quite good for what little I paid ... I first saw HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL when I was very young and it scared the daylights out of me then.  Now however it does appear somewhat campy, but this film's storyline is much better than that ludicrous remake.  Price plays the wealthy man who rents the HOUSE from Elisha Cook who inherits the HOUSE after his sister-in-law hacks his brother to death (some of the ghosts supposedly haunting the place).  However the story involves more mystery and murder than mayhem.  Had the producers of the remake stayed with the original storyline they might have stayed longer at the box office.  The better of the two films on this DVD is THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, the first version of the Richard Matheson novel I AM LEGEND.  This movie despite its foreign cast and inexpensive production values is far superior to the Charleton Heston OMEGA MAN.  LAST is much closer to the novel and Price actually gives a great performance as a rather sad and lonely man whose only existence now is to rid the world of a plague of the undead rendered so by a devastating disease (interesting when you think of the AIDS virus or the current Asian viral pneumonia that can't be cured).  Saved by a vampire bat bite years earlier Price is left immune and the last man on earth (???).  The book upon which this movie was based was written in 1954 long before we knew of the Vampire LeStat.  It weaves science fiction and horror into a rather interesting story.",5,A Great Price For Vincent Price...,1048896000,"03 29, 2003",2003,1516,"['DVD', 'Diamond', 'Entertainment', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'what', 'little', 'paid', 'first', 'saw', 'HOUSE', 'ON', 'HAUNTED', 'HILL', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'scared', 'daylights', 'then', 'Now', 'however', 'appear', 'somewhat', 'campy', 'film', 'storyline', 'much', 'better', 'ludicrous', 'remake', 'Price', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'HOUSE', 'Elisha', 'Cook', 'who', 'HOUSE', 'sister-in-law', 'brother', 'death', 'ghosts', 'supposedly', 'haunting', 'place', 'However', 'story', 'more', 'mystery', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'Had', 'producers', 'remake', 'stayed', 'original', 'storyline', 'might', 'have', 'stayed', 'longer', 'box', 'office', 'better', 'two', 'films', 'DVD', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'first', 'version', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'movie', 'foreign', 'cast', 'inexpensive', 'production', 'values', 'far', 'superior', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'OMEGA', 'MAN', 'LAST', 'much', 'closer', 'novel', 'Price', 'actually', 'great', 'performance', 'rather', 'sad', 'lonely', 'man', 'only', 'existence', 'now', 'rid', 'world', 'plague', 'undead', 'rendered', 'so', 'devastating', 'disease', 'interesting', 'when', 'think', 'AIDS', 'virus', 'current', 'Asian', 'viral', 'pneumonia', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'cured', 'Saved', 'vampire', 'bat', 'bite', 'years', 'earlier', 'Price', 'left', 'immune', 'last', 'man', 'earth', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'written', '1954', 'long', 'knew', 'Vampire', 'LeStat', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'rather', 'interesting', 'story']",House on Haunted Hill/The Last Man On Earth
554983,A2RD0B8LLOSMCQ,B00004WGAB,"Christian Lehrer ""Christian Lehrer""","[0, 1]","I read the other (30) reviews written so far, before writing this.  I purchased the second release (2001) of this DVD.  The reviewer from Long Island correctly pointed out that it has been released twice.  This second release was a dual-layered (so it claimed) single sided disc with both movies released in Widescreen.While I agree that the transfer of ""The Last Man On Earth"" is not as good as ""House on Haunted Hill"" I have yet to see better.  I also have not seen this movie in Widescreen before nor have I even heard of it being released in Widescreen other than this ""Diamond"" DVD that I purchased for a budget price. I have seen two other DVD's of ""The Last Man On Earth"" one on a triple bill from BFS entertainment (""Great Bloodsucking Vampire Movies"") and on another triple bill from Platinum Home Video (with ""The Satanic rites of Dracula"" as well as ""House"") both were budget dvds with similiar picture quality but neither was widescreen.  Although I formerly collected many Laserdiscs, sadly, I didn't manage to add these Vincent Price classics to that collection.The main reason I am bothered, however, by the other reviewers who are (quite justly, I am sure) critical of this DVD is that I have seen (and I am fairly new to DVD) quite a few major studio releases of better known, even famous coveted films, get even worse treatment on DVD!!  Extras??, you have got to be kidding?, at this price I don't expect any.  While they are modest, this DVD has some extras (also this 2001 Widescreen release may have a few more than the 2000 dual sided Widescreen/Fullscreen release) and four illustrated chapter markers per film plus a few extra stops per film you can chapter through.I have seen Paramount release films like ""Silver Bullet and ""Pretty in Pink"" with no extras at all for four times what I paid for this ""Diamond"" release.  I don't mean to single out Paramount (they do seem to include very few dvd extras considering mostly above average prices) for I also have DVDs from other major studios such as Warner, MGM/UA, Universal, and Fox that have no chapter stops or sport poor prints or transfers.  I have one DVD (an English language film) that even left out sub-titles of intermittent foreign language dialogue, that exist in every other print and version of the movie (Theatrical release, Broadcast TV, Cable, VHS, Beta, Lasersdisc) that I have seen.If someone finds better DVD's of these Vincent Price classics (at any price! hehe!) please pass the info along.

554984,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00004WGAB,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 5]","It doesn't get much better than this twin-bill of Vincent Price classics.  I consider The House on Haunted Hill to be one of the best haunted house movies ever made.  The effects may seem somewhat silly to modern audiences, but the simplest frights are often the most effective.  The plot itself is gratifyingly complex and twisted, and the ending is by no means disappointing.  Anyone with an interest in the horror genre should find this Vincent Price gem to be quite a hoot.  Then there's The Last Man on Earth, which is one of the best horror movies ever made, period.As a jaded modern horror fan, I can't say The House on Haunted Hill really scared me, but I daresay that if you put a couple of hundred people inside a modern movie theatre and showed this film to them, you would get some delightful screams and jumps out of your audience.  A movie such as this belongs in black and white, and the whole mood is appropriately creepy.  The director left almost nothing out: creaking doors, apparitions, secret rooms, screams (almost so many they become annoying), skeletons, thunder and lightning, organ music, moments of total darkness, a pit of acid, and - of course - Vincent Price.Mr. Loren (Price) is an eccentric man of wealth throwing a haunted house party for his fourth wife (who is as anxious to kill him as he is to kill her).  He promises to pay $10,000 to anyone who can make it through the night.  Five strangers make up the party guests - a former test pilot, a society newspaper columnist, a psychiatrist, an unassuming, vulnerable young lady, and the house's owner, who keeps going on and on about the murders that took place there.  Naturally, weird things start to happen, and then all of the party goers find themselves locked in the house prematurely with no hope of escape until morning.  Naturally, rather than stay together, the houseguests end up wandering around on their own, and the impressionable young lady is especially traumatized throughout the evening by what she sees and experiences.  There are games afoot, the full extent of which are not revealed until the ending of the film.  In its original theatrical release, the ever so fiendish director William Castle had a skeleton rigged inside each theater that would appear above the audience's heads at the appropriate time - I would love to have experienced that.The Last Man on Earth is based on Richard Matheson's incredible novel I Am Legend, in my opinion the second best vampire novel ever written.  Price plays Morgan, a man left completely alone in the world by a plague that wiped out the rest of the population, including his wife and young daughter, three years earlier.  The virus behind the plague was a vampiric bacillus, so all of the people who died and were not destroyed by fire have come back as vampires.  Luckily for Morgan, the vampires are quite weak and simple-minded, for they attack his fortified home every night in an effort to get in and kill him.  By day, Morgan goes out hunting the walking nightmares and driving stakes through their hearts, but there are so many that the project seems almost useless.  Midway through the movie, we are treated to a pretty extended set of flashbacks to the early days of the virus and the deaths of Morgan's wife and daughter.  Toward the end, Morgan is shocked to find a woman wandering outside during the day, the first human being he has seen in three years.  He takes her home with him and thus sets the stage for the movie's memorable climax.Obviously, Vincent Price carries this movie on his own back, given the fact that the vast majority of the action takes place around him and no one else.  He plays things rather subtly for the most part, which I found quite effective.  His memories make him laugh sometimes, but Price's signature laugh evolves quite effectively into sobs of anger and frustration.  The most poignant moments of the film, in my opinion, come when Morgan finds a dog outside his house, the first living creature he has seen in three years.  The dog initially runs away from him in fear, but the suffering creature eventually comes back.  Morgan cleans him and fixes up his wounds, but the new friendship he exults over soon becomes just another tragedy.  The movie doesn't dwell on the dog episode nearly so much as Matheson does in his novel, and for this I am grateful because I find it heartbreaking.  The little dog gives an incredible performance, but as is so often the case the canine actor does not even merit a mention in the credits.The Last Man on Earth really is a remarkably good movie and really showcases the immense acting abilities of Vincent Price.  I wish it would have delved into the science of the virus much more intensely than it did; the scientific aspects of Matheson's story are what make it such a phenomenally good vampire novel.  The script writers did take some liberties with the concluding scenes, but it is really for the best because the novel's conclusion would not have worked in this medium without the audience being given a much more penetrating look into the minds and motives of the characters involved.  Some might find the movie creepy, but there is really nothing here that will disturb the timid viewer-the camera never actually shows any of the gruesome acts that tend to be committed by human beings against vampires and vice versa.  Somber and depressing as it can be, The Last Man on Earth is the type of distinguished horror movie that should appeal in some way to just about everyone.",5,Two must-see Vincent Price

554985,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B00004WGAB,Danno,"[3, 3]","This ""House on Haunted Hill""/""Last Man on Earth"" double feature is one of the better buys on the public-domain DVD market. The prints of both films are passable (it's an exaggeration to claim these are ""digitally remastered""), and certainly of better quality than the TV prints that have been circulating for years. Both films, of course, feature the late legend Vincent Price and while neither film could be considered his best work there's plenty here Price fans will enjoy.Vincent Price may have built his career around low-budget horror films, but he was a movie star in the truest sense of the word. His very presence helped to elevate an average film to something memorable. While some find his mannerisms and demeanor campy, I find the glee with which he portrayed the disturbed and obsessed very refreshing. ""House on Haunted Hill"" bears a strong similarity to any number of forgettable faux-haunted house movies, and ""Last Man on Earth""'s plot is a second rate Twilight Zone adventure. But Price's performances make both of these not only worthwhile but memorable.

House on Haunted Hill is far superior to the technically rich remake.  Last Man on Earth has Vincent Price in his best role, and one that Charlton Heston couldn't duplicate in the &quot;Omega Man&quot; remake.  If you can find either one of these movies on a different DVD, get them...Both of these movies, but especially Last Man on Earth deserve better care than the manufacturer gave them on this DVD.  Last Man on Earth is made from a umpteenth generation copy of the film that is so scratchy I was wondering in the beginning if I was watching someone's old 8 mm home movies.  House on Haunted Hill is somewhat better, but you'd think that the owners of these movies would try to redigitalize, and fix the scratches and other physical flaws of these movies.Furthermore, the soundtracks of these movies sound more that they were recorded through an old sock.  It's really unfortunate that a better effort was not made to preserve these movies so those in the future could appreciate their real value as movie fun, rather than look at them as old used, and worthless, relics.Since no attempt was made to upgrade the look and sound of these movies, I cannot recommend the purchase of them.

Schoon ""Apolloman""","[1, 1]","I bought this for the movie that I remembered, House on Haunted Hill, which on watching again is a pretty cheezy piece of work.  The other movie, Last Man on Earth, I had never heard of, and recognised only from the intro on the DVD which told me in so many words that it was based on I Am Legend by Richard Matheson.  I found I really liked this movie.  In a sense, it's like many other 50's and 60's movies in that the bad guy(s) lose.  That's the only resemblance, however.  In the first part we see Vincent Price as the relentless vampire slayer.  Others have commented that these don't seem like ""real"" vampires, but who knows what they would really be like anyway.  We've seen too many Dracula remakes where the vampires are quick, agile, mean and clever.  Who is to say they can't be slow, stupid, weak and evil?  Anyway.  In the second part, we are given the story of the beginning of the plague, which resmebles The Stand, only about 99.99999999% fatal.  One survivor, to be exact.  As the third part progresses, we start to see new possible candidates for the good guys (behaving just like we do in the old Dracula movies).  Finally we see Price for what he has become, a legendary creature of terror, in a total reversal from the vampire as the shadowy creature in all the other stories.  You have to see it.

554990,A61P4OJZ7J70S,B00004WGAB,"Mushroom ""mushrom""","[2, 2]","These movies are both examples of the two segments of movie making that Vincent Price excelled in:  Classic Horror and Camp.The House On Haunted Hill is classic Camp.  Take your enemies, put them together in a &quot;Haunted house&quot; with guns, and let the fireworks fly.  The twists and turns are amazing, and will constantly leave you guessing what will happen next.  Just trying to decide who killed who, and who is really dead is a lot of fun to watch.  And Mr. Price in his droll somber character is a hoot to watch.  He is like a dark point of reason amongst the insanity.If you liked the Doctor Phibes movies, this movie should be very entertaining.The Last Man On Earth is another classic.  Although it has been remade several times since then (The Omega Man and Night Of The Living Dead are the best known examples).A disease has been passed around that kills all of mankind, except for Mr. Price.  Every night he locks himself into his house to try and keep away from the &quot;vampires&quot; that have killed the rest of mankind, and are trying to kill him as well.Every day, he sets forth from his lair to hunt down and kill the vampires.  But later on in the movie, he discovers that he is not alone, and that there are some &quot;pseudo-vampires&quot;.  These vampires are infected, but do not have the mind-robbing insanity of the common vampires.  Now Mr. Price must try and decide if these vampires should be destroyed as well, or if he should join forces with them, and together try and destroy the mindless vampires.This is horror in the classic sense.  The tension and terror is very real, but the gore level is very low.  This is a form that is not seen anymore.  TOday's horror movies seem to have taken the &quot;gross&quot; aspect shortcut that this form of movie achieves with simple stark sets and chilling dialog (compare this to &quot;Hannibal&quot; to see what I mean).This is a great horror movie for all ages, and even children 10 years old should be able to take it without having nightmares for weeks to come.  If you have not discovered Vincent Price yet, this is a perfect movie to start.  I can guarantee that once you see this true master in action, you will want to see him again and again.",5,"2 Vincent Price movies for the price of one, how can you go",1000080000,"09 10, 2001",2001,2230,"['movies', 'are', 'examples', 'two', 'segments', 'movie', 'making', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'excelled', 'Classic', 'Horror', 'Camp.The', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'classic', 'Camp', 'Take', 'enemies', 'put', 'together', 'quot', 'Haunted', 'house', 'quot', 'guns', 'let', 'fireworks', 'fly', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'amazing', 'will', 'constantly', 'leave', 'guessing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'Just', 'trying', 'decide', 'who', 'killed', 'who', 'who', 'really', 'dead', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Mr.', 'Price', 'droll', 'somber', 'character', 'hoot', 'watch', 'dark', 'point', 'reason', 'insanity.If', 'liked', 'Doctor', 'Phibes', 'movies', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining.The', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'classic', 'been', 'remade', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'Omega', 'Man', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'are', 'best', 'known', 'examples', '.A', 'disease', 'been', 'passed', 'mankind', 'Mr.', 'Price', 'Every', 'night', 'house', 'try', 'keep', 'away', 'quot', 'vampires', 'quot', 'have', 'killed', 'rest', 'mankind', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'well.Every', 'day', 'forth', 'lair', 'hunt', 'down', 'kill', 'vampires', 'later', 'movie', 'not', 'alone', 'are', 'quot', 'pseudo-vampires', 'quot', 'vampires', 'are', 'infected', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'mind-robbing', 'insanity', 'common', 'vampires', 'Now', 'Mr.', 'Price', 'must', 'try', 'decide', 'vampires', 'should', 'be', 'destroyed', 'well', 'should', 'join', 'forces', 'together', 'try', 'destroy', 'mindless', 'vampires.This', 'horror', 'classic', 'sense', 'tension', 'terror', 'very', 'real', 'gore', 'level', 'very', 'low', 'form', 'not', 'seen', 'anymore', 'TOday', 'horror', 'movies', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'quot', 'gross', 'quot', 'aspect', 'shortcut', 'form', 'movie', 'achieves', 'simple', 'stark', 'sets', 'chilling', 'dialog', 'compare', 'quot', 'Hannibal', 'quot', 'see', 'what', 'mean', '.This', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'ages', 'even', 'children', '10', 'years', 'old', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'having', 'nightmares', 'weeks', 'come', 'have', 'not', 'discovered', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'yet', 'perfect', 'movie', 'start', 'can', 'guarantee', 'once', 'see', 'true', 'master', 'action', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again']",House on Haunted Hill/The Last Man On Earth

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[2, 2]","While ""The Last Man on Earth"" is a fine Vincent Price vampire film, I wish to focus particularly on this 1959, black-and-white version of ""House on Haunted Hill"".First, this is the version that you want, especially if you have a widescreen television. Many other DVD releases have been ""panned and scanned"" to facilitate the full-screen aspect, (which cuts off the left and right sides of the film and renders a blurrier negative). Others are listed as ""widescreen"". In my opinion, the letterbox format is superior to these other alternatives.As I mentioned in the heading, this is my personal favorite of all horror films. Vincent Price is just at his pinnacle in this one! The filmscore here is superb, a 60s atmospheric and wandering composition by Von Dexter. And, by the way, skip the mediocre color remake version of this film (1999).The story here is that Vincent Price plays a playboy millionaire who, along with his unfaithful wife, invites a number of people to stay overnight in a haunted, but modern, mansion where a number of people who previously stayed were murdered. If these ""players"" survive the night, they get $10,000 each. Each of the guests has been personally selected from varying rungs of the social ladder but they all have one thing in common: they're all hard-up for cash! You won't guess the end of this one.Directed by the great William Castle, the sets and location of the film are pure treasure, especially the ""acid well"" in the basement! The cinematography is superb and the casting, including the neurotic Elisha Cook, Jr. as the house owner, is perfect. The man and wife servants are pretty darn shocking too.This print is the best you can obtain.

554993,A32MGX6RYUF598,B00004WGAB,Paul Kesler,"[2, 3]","I first saw this film in my mid-teens, when I had no critical faculties whatsoever. In those days, Bergman and Fellini would have bored hell out of me (Fellini still does), and ""Citizen Kane"" would have left me cold. And many of the films I used to love as a child now strike me as boring. But for some reason, ""Last Man on Earth"" continues to plunge me into a state of pleasurable gloom, and I keep returning to it every other week like some sort of drug, or one of those amulets cinematic hypnotists dangle before their victims while coaxing them toward some nefarious climax.I won't attempt an ""objective"" review of this film, since I'm far too familiar with it, so my impressions are visceral rather than analytic. Also, I long ago ceased to care about the plot (which is amply detailed in many of the other reviews included here). The acting? Here, too, I'm too close to it to make a reliable assessment. I'd have to say that Vincent Price is only slightly hammy in his role as a weary vampire-hunter, and in one scene, where he's vocally mourning the loss of his wife, ""Virge,"" he lapses into some rather embarrassing self-consciousness. The only other aspect of the film that annoys me ---- from an adult vantage point, that is ---- is the atrocious dubbing of the Italian actors, and the ridiculous exhortations of the vampires as they surround the protagonist's house, trying to lure him outside.Otherwise, ""Last Man"" still strikes me as one of the best examples of atmospheric film-making in the history of the genre, and it is on this level that I can wholly immerse myself in its special qualities. It does not really resemble any other film ever made ------ much like the international collaboration, ""Daughters of Darkness"" in that respect. It does not even resemble ""Night of the Living Dead,"" though it clearly influenced that film thematically. It has that sleazy, low-budget quality that most true horror fans love, but other than that it is sui generis.Part of the power of the film, I believe, is that it concentrates largely on the situation of a totally isolated character, surrounded by alien beings with whom he has no chance of communicating. The fact that he loses both his wife and a close friend to this ""enemy camp"" only adds to his sense of despair (not to mention a stray dog which he briefly befriends before discovering that it, too, has succumbed to the ""vampire germ"").The music score, while not in the class of Bernard Herrmann or Maurice Jarre, is nevertheless wonderfully appropriate for the film, and assists the production with just the right touch of eeriness. Parts of it spill over into excess, perhaps, but it's the right kind of excess.The DVD (Diamond) edition of the film is only passable, and hopefully it will get transferred from a better print eventually. But for now, we should be grateful for this budget version. ""Last Man on Earth"" is not the greatest horror film ever made ---- and this is as ""objective"" as I can be at this stage ---- but it's one of the most effective when approached in the right spirit.",4,"A Strictly ""Subjective"" Assessment",1049414400,"04 4, 2003",2003,3063,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'mid-teens', 'when', 'had', 'critical', 'faculties', 'days', 'Bergman', 'Fellini', 'would', 'have', 'bored', 'hell', 'Fellini', 'still', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'cold', 'many', 'films', 'used', 'love', 'child', 'now', 'boring', 'reason', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'plunge', 'state', 'pleasurable', 'gloom', 'keep', 'returning', 'other', 'week', 'sort', 'drug', 'one', 'amulets', 'cinematic', 'hypnotists', 'dangle', 'victims', 'coaxing', 'nefarious', 'climax.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'objective', 'review', 'film', ""'m"", 'far', 'too', 'familiar', 'impressions', 'are', 'visceral', 'rather', 'analytic', 'Also', 'long', 'ago', 'ceased', 'care', 'plot', 'amply', 'detailed', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'included', 'here', 'acting', 'Here', 'too', ""'m"", 'too', 'close', 'make', 'reliable', 'assessment', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'only', 'slightly', 'hammy', 'role', 'weary', 'vampire-hunter', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'vocally', 'mourning', 'loss', 'wife', 'Virge', 'rather', 'embarrassing', 'self-consciousness', 'only', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'adult', 'vantage', 'point', 'atrocious', 'dubbing', 'Italian', 'actors', 'ridiculous', 'exhortations', 'vampires', 'surround', 'protagonist', 'house', 'trying', 'lure', 'outside.Otherwise', 'Last', 'Man', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'atmospheric', 'film-making', 'history', 'genre', 'level', 'can', 'wholly', 'immerse', 'special', 'qualities', 'not', 'really', 'resemble', 'other', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'much', 'international', 'collaboration', 'Daughters', 'Darkness', 'respect', 'not', 'even', 'resemble', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'clearly', 'influenced', 'film', 'thematically', 'sleazy', 'low-budget', 'quality', 'most', 'true', 'horror', 'fans', 'love', 'other', 'sui', 'generis.Part', 'power', 'film', 'believe', 'largely', 'situation', 'totally', 'isolated', 'character', 'surrounded', 'alien', 'beings', 'whom', 'chance', 'communicating', 'fact', 'wife', 'close', 'friend', 'enemy', 'camp', 'only', 'sense', 'despair', 'not', 'mention', 'stray', 'dog', 'befriends', 'discovering', 'too', 'succumbed', 'vampire', 'germ', '.The', 'music', 'score', 'not', 'class', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'nevertheless', 'wonderfully', 'appropriate', 'film', 'production', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'eeriness', 'Parts', 'over', 'excess', 'perhaps', 'right', 'kind', 'excess.The', 'DVD', 'Diamond', 'edition', 'film', 'only', 'passable', 'hopefully', 'will', 'get', 'transferred', 'better', 'print', 'eventually', 'now', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'budget', 'version', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'not', 'greatest', 'horror', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'objective', 'can', 'be', 'stage', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'approached', 'right', 'spirit']",House on Haunted Hill/The Last Man On Earth

Rodden II,"[0, 0]","You may or may not know that ""Last Man On Earth"" was originally slated to be a Hammer Film, but for some reason the project fell through. Thank goodness it was still made, though I can't help wondering what kind of glossy, color, big production film Hammer Studio would've made of this story in its hey-day (maybe it would've had another favorite horror icon of mine starring in it, Peter Cushing!). And thank God they got Vincent Price for the film, because he gives one of his best performances ever in this movie. It's a dark, moody piece about the sad extinction of a species...man.Unlike many of the reviewers, I didn't see this film till I bought a rare VHS copy about ten years ago. I'd read Richard Matheson's very creepy novel, and I'd been a huge fan of ""The Omega Man"" since I was a boy, so I was thrilled to find there was another adaptation out there, AND it had one of my all-time favorite horror actors, Vincent Price.Sadly, the print on this DVD version is not superior quality, though it is better than the VHS copy I still have; perhaps they did clean it up some. And though it does have a tiny black bar at the top and the bottom, I don't think it's shown in it's original aspect ration. Still, it's not straight standard, either. The print used for this DVD shows wear; there are some drop-outs (white specks and flickers). The sound is not perfect, but once again, superior to the VHS version. I bought it souly for ""Last Man On Earth"", because I already own the Warner Bros. DVD release of ""The House On Haunted Hill"". I checked out some of ""House"" on this DVD, and it appears to be of a similar remastered quality, however the aspect ratio is not quiet the same as the Warner version.  For ""House"", get the Warner Bros. version, it's much better quality.If you love Vincent Price, this is a fantastic buy! The price of this DVD is unbeatable for what you get; two great movies in splendid black and white, with two very differant performances by Price. The over-the-top sauve host in ""House On Haunted Hill"", and the much more subdued, gravely serious (as it should be for this particular subject matter) mindset in ""Last Man On Earth"". I'm not at all disappointed in this DVD, and as a horror movie fan (which you must be or you wouldn't have found your way to this review), I don't think you will be, either.",4,Good Example of a Great B-Grade Horror Movie,978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,2333,"['may', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'was', 'originally', 'slated', 'be', 'Hammer', 'Film', 'reason', 'project', 'fell', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'was', 'still', 'made', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'what', 'kind', 'glossy', 'color', 'big', 'production', 'film', 'Hammer', 'Studio', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'story', 'hey-day', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'favorite', 'horror', 'icon', 'mine', 'starring', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'thank', 'God', 'got', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'movie', 'dark', 'moody', 'piece', 'sad', 'extinction', 'species', 'man.Unlike', 'many', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'till', 'bought', 'rare', 'VHS', 'copy', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', ""'d"", 'read', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'very', 'creepy', 'novel', ""'d"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Omega', 'Man', 'was', 'boy', 'was', 'thrilled', 'find', 'was', 'adaptation', 'there', 'had', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'horror', 'actors', 'Vincent', 'Price.Sadly', 'print', 'DVD', 'version', 'not', 'superior', 'quality', 'better', 'VHS', 'copy', 'still', 'have', 'perhaps', 'did', 'clean', 'up', 'have', 'tiny', 'black', 'bar', 'top', 'bottom', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'shown', 'original', 'aspect', 'ration', 'Still', 'not', 'straight', 'standard', 'either', 'print', 'used', 'DVD', 'wear', 'are', 'drop-outs', 'white', 'specks', 'flickers', 'sound', 'not', 'perfect', 'once', 'again', 'superior', 'VHS', 'version', 'bought', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'already', 'own', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'DVD', 'release', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'checked', 'out', 'House', 'DVD', 'be', 'similar', 'remastered', 'quality', 'however', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'not', 'quiet', 'same', 'Warner', 'version', 'House', 'get', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'version', 'much', 'better', 'quality.If', 'love', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'fantastic', 'buy', 'price', 'DVD', 'unbeatable', 'what', 'get', 'two', 'great', 'movies', 'splendid', 'black', 'white', 'two', 'very', 'differant', 'performances', 'Price', 'over-the-top', 'sauve', 'host', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'much', 'more', 'subdued', 'gravely', 'serious', 'should', 'be', 'particular', 'subject', 'matter', 'mindset', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', ""'m"", 'not', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'must', 'be', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'way', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be']",House on Haunted Hill/The Last Man On Earth

Each person will be paid for surviving the night. The house itself is just a big house - nothing really gothic about it. People will be tempted to compare this movie to the more recent remake - if you can actually call it that. Both involve the invitation to stay in a haunted house, but that's pretty much it for what they have in common. (There is one other similarity, but I'd risk a spoiler if I say much about that.) This version is not as weird as the remake. However, when this version was released, audiences were presented with Emergo (?) - a skeleton being pulled out over them during a key scene. On this DVD, the movie has a nice, clear letterboxed image. Great quality considering the price._The Last Man On Earth_ is based on the story _I Am Legend_ by Richard Matheson. Vincent Price plays the part of Robert Neville who believes he is the last human alive on Earth. Everyone else has been infected with a virus that has turned them into vampires. Neville doesn't know why he was spared. The production style does appear similar to the original _Night of the Living Night_. _The Omega Man_ was also based on _I Am Legend_, but this movie remains more loyal to the original story. For this movie, the image quality on the DVD is a bit grainy. I'm guessing a 16mm print might have been used.The DVD has a few basic extras, but nothing major.

554998,ANO0XQ6XSIEVJ,B00004WGAB,"Steven W. Hill ""Owner of shillpages.com""","[3, 3]","HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is a minor classic, and possibly William Castle's best film. It's presented on the DVD in a pleasant widescreen transfer, not as good as the individual Warner Home Video release (ASIN 0790744309) but not even remotely as disappointing as you might think, given the low cost of the disc. Still frames are jittery, but when in motion the picture is not at all bad. The movie itself can still deliver a few tingles today.THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, the first film adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel I AM LEGEND (ISBN 031286504X), is probably the movie that will get the most attention, considering its availability on video has been intermittent over the years (while HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is already on DVD twice, at least, not counting the recent remake). The biggest disappointment is that the transfer of LAST MAN is NOT widescreen. The fact that the widescreen laserdisc is so difficult to find makes this even worse. It would have been so nice to have this DVD feature both movies in letterboxed form! Alas, no such luck. The print itself is not in nearly as good condition as HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, either.But consider the price! Both movies are very good, one is seldom seen and unjustly forgotten. You'll be paying under four bucks per movie, how can you complain much about the quality? If and when a better version of THE LAST MAN ON EARTH makes it to DVD, you won't even feel bad about spending money for another copy because the first hardly breaks the bank.

The movie is based on the story ""I am Legend"" by famed horror writer Richard Matheson.  Genre favorite Vincent Price plays a scientist who believes he may be the lone survivor of a world wide plague that has transformed everyone into vampires.  Price plays the part of the man tormented by his loneliness perfectly.  By day he hunts the sleeping undead, and by night he is tormented by them as they pound on his home as the lead vampire constantly calling to him:  ""Morgan, come out Morgan"". Very creepy.The DVD I purchased is the 2001 widescreen release from Diamond Entertainment.  It is identified by the red banner across the top marked ""Widescreen Edition"".  The film transfer is far from perfect, but as another reviewer said this is the only widescreen transfer I know of on DVD.  The picture and sound are not all that bad.  It looks just as good if not slightly better than versions that air on cable from time to time.  This gem represents classic horror at its best.
