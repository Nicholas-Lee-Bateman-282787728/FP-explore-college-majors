I hate these english actors that are cast as Americans, Beckinsale and Bale are the two prime examples but there are many more.The acting was universally bad here as well, Nolte seems very wooden in particular but Beckinsale is not far behind, the only decent acting was by Uma Thurman.This felt like an incomplete study throughout, by far the worst MI movie I've seen.

672197,AU78WGAXA3IY1,B00005OBAL,"Chelle ""Chelle""","[3, 6]","*The Golden Bowl* is, it would seem, a movie of potential. Indeed, the story, with its rather soap opera-esque plot points, would be quite entertaining--if, that is, it weren't for a few missteps.It hardly seems fair to say that it is because of the acting that the characters seem either lackluster or absurd. Thurman, however, seems to have some misapprehensions in regards to Charlotte's motivations. She sets a petulant tone, falls back on silliness, takes a turn as a confident seductress, and ends up something of a lovelorn martyr. If done right, it seems as though these traits could align themselves within one person's personality effectively, but that is not so here. As a viewer I care little for her personal pain and even less for her momentary triumphs. Northam is justifiable in his role; he is a truly beautiful man and completely believable in his passion, which he is hardly allowed to bring to the surface, though if he had it would have added some much needed feeling to the film. Many viewers have written his performance off due to his attempt at an Italian accent (and, I must say, it is odd that they have a man with a genuine British accent playing an Italian,) but I found it easy enough to ignore his speech in favor of his superior facial expressions. As for Nolte and Beckinsale, well, I must say that for a good deal of the film it seemed as though they were carrying out some kind of incestuous relationship. This may or may not be due to the way the actors conceived their characters to be, but it was unwelcome in my mind. They are so absorbed with each other that it is easy to forgive Charlotte and Amerigo their brief affair. In short, I believed in them as people not at all and therefore found it impossible to sympathize or moralize. I almost always play devil's advocate, but in this case it would have even been nice to call upon morals in order to feel anything at all.I have often heard that Merchant Ivory films are lavish, highly appealing to the senses, but if that is their trademark it is missing in *The Golden Bowl*.  Northam is the most compelling thing to look upon, but then, you need not watch this movie in order to appreciate his good fortune. In fact, it would be advisable to watch *Emma* instead or, heck, *The Net.*Fans of period films should be able to appreciate the costumes and...and...Well, perhaps that's all. If, by some chance, you were to miss an opportunity to watch *The Golden Bowl* it would not be the worst fate to befall you.

672198,A3I7EHVQ4AAKFV,B00005OBAL,"Christina ""Lisa""","[13, 13]","The Golden Bowl is a beautiful movie that, like the bowl in the title, seems perfect, but there is a crack somewhere.  I highly recommend it because the story and the production are so intriguing.  The sets, costumes, ambiance and writing are signature Ivory/Merchant quality. The cast is first rate.  I looked really closely at the acting to find where the break is, and the movie needs to warm up to climb to the emotional activity that brings its meaning to life.  I struggled during the first half of the movie to pay attention.  When veils of complacency give way to questions and expression of true or other feelings is when everything comes together.  Jeremy Northum as Prince Amerigo is dashing enough to remind one of Giancarlo Gianini in The Innocent. Kate Bechinsale, Nick Nolte, Anjelica Huston and James Fox offer measured but effective performances that have to ride the story.  It is Uma Thurman who has to bring it home, and she does a very good job.  The novel by Henry James is not easy to pack into a 2-hour movie, but this was a very good attempt.  Didnt Masterpiece Theater have to spread it into a miniseries? I think it starred Gail Honeycutt. Dont drop The Golden Bowl.  You have to see it once.

In the movie, at least, it is not at all clear that Amerigo would rather be with Charlotte, and is marrying Maggie only for the money.  It seems instead that he is marrying Maggie in hopes of a happy life (which yes, includes money) but that he allows Charlotte to think he still loves her so she can save face.  Charlotte chases Amerigo all through the movie and though she finally manages to seduce him, it's true what the Colonel says to his wife, that he doesn't really care for her.  He admires her and is attracted to her but he doesn't love her.In contrast, he clearly does love Maggie and his son.  He doesn't admire her until he first hears her say she doesn't like someone; at that moment she becomes more interesting to him, and when she confronts him, he falls in love with her.  Somehow this all made perfect sense to me.  In some way by Maggie pretending not to see she also let him think she didn't care.When he realizes what his choices are, there is simply no contest.It didn't seem to me that Maggie was manipulative in getting her father to take Charlotte away, although I suppose she was-- but it also was kind.Anyway, maybe it's just that I saw this after the Sopranos finale (!) but I thought this was one of the most nuanced depictions of the levels in human relationships, particularly in marriage, that I've ever seen captured on film.it's also beautiful to look at.

672211,A24I3BMB9JZC7O,B00005OBAL,"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it...","[22, 25]","I'm amazed this film has drawn so many - and so varied - responses! Anyone deciding on whether or not to purchase the DVD may well end up confused. Is this a good film? Is Uma Thurman the only weak point? Is Kate Beckinsale boring? Is everyone irritating except for the character of Charlotte? And so on and so on and so on...I found the acting of everyone in the film splendid. I was convinced by each character. I didn't LIKE each character, but I was convinced by the actors.Jeremy Northam's character, a cash-poor Italian minor prince, is a deeply flawed man whose former romance with Charlotte (Uma Thurman) is brought to an unsympathetic end by his decision to wed Maggie, a sweet and practical American heiress (Kate Beckinsale) for her money. He doesn't seem to be in love with either Charlotte or Maggie at this point, but he is certainly intent on ending his former relationship and starting off his marriage with good intentions. Charlotte is clearly deeply upset - she appears to have been far more emotionally invested in the relationship than he.Charlotte, who weds Maggie's father in a hell-bent way (clearly intent on retaining her presence in the prince's life), then manipulates events so that she's alone with her former lover, and invites him to resume their intimate relationship. She thinks she's in love; one cannot say the same for Northam's character, who appears to be attracted, yes, but not in love. There's also a dynamic created by his feeling left out by his wife's close relationsihp with her father. A man who feels neglected is certainly vulnerable to other influences... which isn't to excuse him, but to give some idea of the influences in his life. Once the affair's underway, it gains momentum and the pair seem to risk disclosure without caring too deeply.As this deeply flawed man who ends up learning the real value of his wife and feeling appalled by the pain he caused her, Jeremy Northam is simply superb. This would be an easy character to overplay or underplay - but Mr Northam gets it exactly right.As Charlotte, Uma Thurman is surprisingly good. I've often seen her in sub-standard films (the appalling film Pay Check comes to mind), but this is a magnificent role for her. Again, it's perfectly placed. The audience feels both sympathy for her and dislike for the things she does.Kate Beckinsale is wonderful as Maggie. For most of the film, we, the audience, have no idea what Maggie knows or suspects, and we can even become a little exasperated by her apparent ignorance and that seeming insensitivity. She seems like a perfectly nice young woman whom we want to shake awake - until the moment when she realises incontrovertibly what has been happening. The title of the film, ""Golden Bowl"", becomes the metaphor for human relationships - specifically, marriage. And Maggie's agony when she realises there is a terrible flaw in her marriage, that the love and trust she has felt have been abused, is so real and true that it hits one in the face.Nick Nolte as Maggie's father is also wonderful. His quality of toughness is nicely contrasted by the dignity that is evidence in both him and his daughter. One can see the terrific bond between the two, and the way in which Charlotte, although not obviously punished for seducing her daughter-in-law's husband, is not going to be able to sway her husband when he decides to move away from the lifestyle she loves, in order to protect his daughter's marriage.The cross-currents of human emotion are truly wonderfully portrayed in this film.

672218,A226HIHIVFUPLL,B00005OBAL,Lev Raphael,"[30, 32]","I'm a bit puzzled by all the hostile comments on this movie.I've read The Golden Bowl five times, at least.  I have also seen most film and TV adaptations of James novels and novellas done since the 1970s and this one stands up very well under the double test: is it faithful to the book's spirit, is it a good film?I loved this movie, have seen it twice and given it as a gift. I found it perfectly cast, filmed, and paced.  TGB is a long dense intensely internal book but it has been faithfully rendered by a screenwriter who boldly brought the violence and threat at the core of the book forward in a fascinating sort of prologue, and made one of the book's most famous images, the Pagoda, part of a nightmare. Each time I see these sections I admire her ingenuity.Uma Thurman broke my heart as the passionate, lonely, sensual Europeanized American who cannot have what she wants when she wants it.  Yes, the part was played differently by Gayle Hunnicutt in the estimable British TV version, but so what?  Thurman works because she makes it so clear how much more she wants Amerigo than the opposite and her verbal rebellion at one point is explosive (in a Jamesian way, of course).Jeremy Northam is suitably lordly and devilishly handsome.  His accent sounds just right to me, having been around Europeans who learned English from English speakers: the mix is sometimes inconsistent though charming.Kate Beckinsale is just right as the limited innocent whose innocence is a kind of cruelty and watching her grow up, make the sacrifices she needs to while fighting through the pain of terrible awareness was haunting.  Nick Nolte was sublime as the phlegmatic wealthy collector.  You feel the roughness behind his suavity and the world-weariness.  He's got all these amazing obejcts but what does he really have?  His devotion to his daughter is pitched just right.I loved how the film often cast him and Kate as isolated amid their stupefyinbgly beautiful collections.  I loved how there are scenes opening the movie that take us back to the Prince's Renaissance forebears and that create dramatic irony when she re-enters the orbit of Maggie and Adam.I was captivated by this movie even more the second viewing than the first, and even though the book is so familiar to me that I quote from it now and then.

His daughter, Maggie, adds one Italian prince to the priceless collection. Prince Amerigo knows he is being bought, but also knows he cannot live without money, and so, he is prepared to sacrifice the love of a fascinating, beautiful and brilliant woman to get it. His former mistress, Charlotte Stant, is not as complacent and pops back into his life, since she is the schoolfriend of his wife.However, the Ververs, despite Maggie's marriage and the birth of a son, remain too closely bonded and to alleviate Maggie's guilt at leaving him [ though she spends more time at his houses than she does at her own] Adam Verver marries Charlotte.Though the Ververs are always referred to as being good and innocent, one has to wonder about the goodness behind buying actual human beings, who are far more brilliant, beautiful and interesting, then placing them in gilded cages and requiring them to dance to one's own will.Consequently my sympathies were with Charlotte in her desperate attempt to infuse life into her tomb-like existence and keep the love of her prince. Though the 'good' Ververs will get their way, the Merchant-Ivory team seems unable to bring out the nuances and irony of that purported goodness and turns Charlotte into a rather pathetic villainess.The sets and costumes are gorgeous but the production is uneven, due to a less than insightful script by Prawer Jhabvala  and to the poor acting skills of the talentless Kate Beckinsdale and the performance of Uma Thurman, which sometimes works and sometimes not. Thurman is physically perfect for the role, but is lacking charisma and often delivers her lines poorly--though at other times she shines. Nick Nolte is far too subdued -and only on occasion shows that he might not be as innocent and withdrawn as he seems. Jeremy Northam is best, and despite some criticism of his accent, I think he did well. Angelica Huston, who I normally love, can't decide on an accent and veers from southern to English within minutes, though she was otherwise wonderful as was James Fox, playing her husband.If you can overlook those things and enjoy costume drama then the film is worth seeing.",3,Beautiful but there's a flaw in it,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,2685,"['Based', 'Henry', 'James', 'late', 'opus', 'sumptuous', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'production', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'yet', 'still', 'attractive', 'enough', 'eye', 'candy', 'slow', 'night.James', 'novel', 'was', 'who', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'reveal', 'conceal', 'previous', 'then', 'rekindled', 'affair', 'impoverished', 'prince', 'penurious', 'lover.Filthy', 'rich', 'exceptionally', 'dull', 'Ververs', 'father', 'daughter', 'travel', 'Europe', 'amassing', 'vast', 'collection', 'art', 'art', 'museum', 'industrialist', 'Adam', 'Verver', 'will', 'build', 'American', 'City', 'daughter', 'Maggie', 'one', 'Italian', 'prince', 'priceless', 'collection', 'Prince', 'Amerigo', 'being', 'bought', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'money', 'so', 'prepared', 'sacrifice', 'love', 'fascinating', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'woman', 'get', 'former', 'mistress', 'Charlotte', 'Stant', 'not', 'complacent', 'pops', 'back', 'life', 'schoolfriend', 'wife.However', 'Ververs', 'Maggie', 'marriage', 'birth', 'son', 'remain', 'too', 'closely', 'bonded', 'alleviate', 'Maggie', 'guilt', 'leaving', '[', 'more', 'time', 'houses', 'own', ']', 'Adam', 'Verver', 'marries', 'Charlotte.Though', 'Ververs', 'are', 'always', 'referred', 'being', 'good', 'innocent', 'wonder', 'goodness', 'buying', 'actual', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'brilliant', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'then', 'placing', 'gilded', 'cages', 'requiring', 'dance', 'one', 'own', 'will.Consequently', 'sympathies', 'were', 'Charlotte', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'infuse', 'life', 'tomb-like', 'existence', 'keep', 'love', 'prince', ""'good"", 'Ververs', 'will', 'get', 'way', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'team', 'unable', 'bring', 'out', 'nuances', 'irony', 'purported', 'goodness', 'Charlotte', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'villainess.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'production', 'uneven', 'due', 'less', 'insightful', 'script', 'Prawer', 'Jhabvala', 'poor', 'acting', 'skills', 'talentless', 'Kate', 'Beckinsdale', 'performance', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'sometimes', 'sometimes', 'not', 'Thurman', 'physically', 'perfect', 'role', 'lacking', 'charisma', 'often', 'lines', 'poorly', 'other', 'times', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'far', 'too', 'subdued', '-and', 'only', 'occasion', 'shows', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'innocent', 'withdrawn', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'best', 'criticism', 'accent', 'think', 'did', 'well', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'who', 'normally', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'accent', 'veers', 'southern', 'English', 'minutes', 'was', 'otherwise', 'wonderful', 'was', 'James', 'Fox', 'playing', 'husband.If', 'can', 'overlook', 'things', 'enjoy', 'costume', 'drama', 'then', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

Henry James, author of the novel on which this Ruth Prawer Jhabvala screenplay is based, uses the gilded bowl as a metaphor for love and marriage, focusing on two couples, whose overlapping relationships and marriages prove to be as fragile and damaged as the bowl.  Produced by Merchant-Ivory and sumptuously filmed by Tony Pierce-Roberts on locations in Italy and England, the film brings the intensity of the psychological conflicts to life.Italian Prince Amerigo (Jeremy Northam) is the impoverished owner of Palazzo Ugolini near Rome, unable to maintain the palace until, in 1903, he marries Maggie Verver (Kate Beckinsale), daughter of the first American billionaire, Adam Verver (Nick Nolte). The prince has previously had a secret affair with Charlotte Stant (Uma Thurman), a friend of Maggie.  When Charlotte subsequently marries Adam, Maggie's father, both couples move to England, where three years later, Charlotte and Amerigo resume their passion.The relationships among the four principals are explored with the same sophistication as in James's novel.  Maggie's torment is fully revealed when she suspects an affair, and her determination to protect her father from this knowledge becomes an agonizing chore.  Numerous symbols help to convey the trauma of the betrayal, from the history of the prince's castle, in which an ancestor found his young wife and his son in bed and executed them, to Maggie's dream of being imprisoned in a porcelain pagoda which has a crack.Nolte shows surprising subtlety in his emotions as he suspects his wife's treachery, while Uma Thurman is passionate, reckless, and very seductive in her obsession with the prince.  Northam explores the prince's character fully, moving from early passion for Charlotte to a more mature awareness of his love and respect for Maggie.  Beckinsale, as the ingenuous Maggie, develops maturity and shows remarkable character as she works diligently to protect her marriage and her father.  Supporting roles by Angelica Huston and Madeleine Potter further develop the psychological pressures by illustrating the characters' lives within the context of their frenetic, continental lifestyles.Director James Ivory inserts old kinescope films and newspapers of turn-of-the-century America into the film to illustrate the on-going contrast between life in America and life in Europe, a constant James theme, as Verver builds his new American museum of European treasures.  Lovers of Henry James will find this film faithful to James's intents, while those less enamored of his convoluted literary style may be inspired to read him because of the psychological sophistication of this plot--and this film.

But I can easily understand why so many, going back to that seminar, regard an assignment to read a James' novel as punishment. His novels move slowly and explore deeply the psychology of his characters. It can take a half page to explore what is going on in the mind of a character before the character utters a line in a conversation. Then another half page to process the return line and decide on what to say next in the conversation. I (usually) like the deep exploration of the characters.I also like James' mastery, some might say over-mastery, of the English language. He uses phrases that have since fallen out of the vernacular, if indeed they were ever in it. She ""hung fire,"" meaning that she thought of a response to make but decided not to say it at this time. Or they ""threw them over"" meaning that they had terminated a friendship.The novels work well for Merchant Ivory. They usually involve the upper classes at play in Europe, which results in lovely costumes and locations. The half page of thought before speaking a line can't be duplicated in the film, which is a blessing to many, and it is up to the actors to convey as much as possible what is going on in their heads. The plots are at essence based on the broad human themes of love and hate, treachery and revenge, deception and manipulation.What is the story of The Golden Bowl other than a classic love triangle? But this plot presents the subject uniquely, with a fourth character, Maggie's father, deeply involved in the triangle without actually being part of it. There is also a degree of suspense, with Maggie's doubts about the fidelity of her husband growing until they are finally confirmed in an unexpected way.This was the last major James' novel that I had never read and I went the classic way of reading the book and then watching the film. It is always surprising to see something pop up as an important part of the story,  in this film the American City museum, that was not at all in the novel, but on the whole the adaptation was good and mostly true to the novel in the representation of the main characters. The acting was good. I didn't think that Nick Nolte was a great choice for Adam, but he was OK.If you have already seen Merchant Ivory films then your reaction to those will be a pretty good indication of your reaction to this film.

Within the movie lies the potential for greatness and yet it stumbles at times as accents are overplayed and acting falls short of expectations in a movie of such a grand scale. The sumptuous costumes, lush countryside, castles, intricate jewelry and grand lifestyles will allow you to overlook any minor flaws.The real flaw is in the characters hearts as they each seek to find love in all the wrong places. Charlotte Stant (Uma Thurman) wants desperately to marry Amerigo (Jeremy Northam). Amerigo is an impecunious Italian prince engaged to the privileged heiress Maggie Verver (Kate Beckinsale). Maggie's father Adam Verver (Nick Nolte) only wants the best for his daughter and believes Amerigo can make her happy. It was a delight to see Anjelica Huston playing matchmaker. She is even more of a delight in Ever After.Before the wedding Charlotte tries to tell Amerigo that she is completely in love with him and doesn't care that he cannot take care of her in style. He seems to be infatuated more with the idea of marrying wealth or maybe he is just following his destiny. ""I have to, I want to say it, I want you to know,"" Charlotte pleads.Together they go shopping for Maggie's wedding present and the day comes back to haunt them. They see a golden bowl and yet Charlotte is hesitant about the purchase as the crystal has a flaw covered by gold. This seems to be a metaphor for the loveless marriages hidden in wealth. The bowl is also in a way symbolic of a cup of love.Charlotte seeks only to be near Amerigo and marries Adam in order to be near him as a last attempt at happiness. When Adam and his daughter Maggie are always spending time together, Amerigo is left alone to attend parties with his ""new young stepmother."" Charlotte is innocently enough keeping him company in his solitude, but soon their passions take over and they share an intimate afternoon.My soul spills into yours and is blended.Because my soul has absorbed your fragrance. - RumiCharlotte is intoxicated by Amerigo, yet he seems to be able to deny his true passions for higher aims until he is consumed by the fragrance of Charlotte's soul. Like two thirsty souls, they drink from the same cup of love. What follows is a subtle, psychological drama in which most of the scenes are taken up with unveiling the intricacies of the deceit.It is more a study of how the lovers try to hide their passions. In the end, we feel that the fair maiden Charlotte has lost her heart's desires, while the devious Maggie gains the world.One must bear many things for love...~The Rebecca Review",4,May you drink your fill from the cup of love,1012089600,"01 27, 2002",2002,2662,"['last', 'complete', 'novel', 'Henry', 'James', 'lushly', 'presented', 'yet', 'something', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'movie', 'potential', 'greatness', 'yet', 'times', 'accents', 'are', 'overplayed', 'acting', 'falls', 'short', 'expectations', 'movie', 'grand', 'scale', 'sumptuous', 'costumes', 'lush', 'countryside', 'castles', 'intricate', 'jewelry', 'grand', 'lifestyles', 'will', 'allow', 'overlook', 'minor', 'flaws.The', 'real', 'flaw', 'characters', 'hearts', 'seek', 'find', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'Charlotte', 'Stant', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'desperately', 'marry', 'Amerigo', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Amerigo', 'impecunious', 'Italian', 'prince', 'engaged', 'privileged', 'heiress', 'Maggie', 'Verver', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Maggie', 'father', 'Adam', 'Verver', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'only', 'best', 'daughter', 'Amerigo', 'can', 'make', 'happy', 'was', 'delight', 'see', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'playing', 'matchmaker', 'even', 'more', 'delight', 'Ever', 'After.Before', 'wedding', 'Charlotte', 'tell', 'Amerigo', 'completely', 'love', ""n't"", 'care', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'care', 'style', 'be', 'infatuated', 'more', 'idea', 'marrying', 'wealth', 'maybe', 'just', 'following', 'destiny', 'have', 'want', 'say', 'want', 'know', 'Charlotte', 'pleads.Together', 'go', 'shopping', 'Maggie', 'wedding', 'present', 'day', 'back', 'haunt', 'see', 'golden', 'bowl', 'yet', 'Charlotte', 'hesitant', 'purchase', 'crystal', 'flaw', 'covered', 'gold', 'be', 'metaphor', 'loveless', 'hidden', 'wealth', 'bowl', 'also', 'way', 'symbolic', 'cup', 'love.Charlotte', 'only', 'be', 'near', 'Amerigo', 'marries', 'Adam', 'order', 'be', 'near', 'last', 'attempt', 'happiness', 'When', 'Adam', 'daughter', 'Maggie', 'are', 'always', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'Amerigo', 'left', 'alone', 'attend', 'parties', 'new', 'young', 'stepmother', 'Charlotte', 'innocently', 'enough', 'keeping', 'company', 'solitude', 'soon', 'passions', 'take', 'share', 'intimate', 'afternoon.My', 'soul', 'yours', 'blended.Because', 'soul', 'absorbed', 'fragrance', 'RumiCharlotte', 'intoxicated', 'Amerigo', 'yet', 'be', 'able', 'deny', 'true', 'passions', 'higher', 'aims', 'consumed', 'fragrance', 'Charlotte', 'soul', 'two', 'thirsty', 'souls', 'drink', 'same', 'cup', 'love', 'What', 'subtle', 'psychological', 'drama', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'taken', 'up', 'unveiling', 'intricacies', 'deceit.It', 'more', 'study', 'how', 'lovers', 'try', 'hide', 'passions', 'end', 'feel', 'fair', 'maiden', 'Charlotte', 'lost', 'heart', 'desires', 'devious', 'Maggie', 'gains', 'world.One', 'must', 'bear', 'many', 'things', 'love', '~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
672232,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005OBAL,Reviewer,"[8, 15]","There must be an old saying about how people with too much money and time on their hands will find a way to misery, unhappiness and trouble before they can seek or find redemption in true love, truth and honesty.  But the flawed relationships and imperfections of human nature make ""The Golden Bowl,"" directed by James Ivory, a perfect metaphor for the lives of the four principals involved in this story, which takes place at the beginning of the 20th Century.  Prince Amerigo (Jeremy Northam) is broke, and to restore his villa in Italy, as well as the stature of his name and lifestyle, he gives up his true love, Charlotte (Uma Thurman), to marry Maggie (Kate Beckinsale), the daughter of the first American Billionaire, Adam Verver (Nick Nolte).  Charlotte then proceeds to marry Adam, and due to some eccentricities on the part of Adam and Maggie, the four become as one big, confused and dysfunctional family, playing out their drama in England and Italy, while Adam pursues his obsessive dream of building a museum in ""American Town,"" which he feels will ""give back"" something to those who have worked their lives away in the coal mines wherein his fortune was made.  It's a world in which the priorities of those involved, however, become twisted, and truth, fidelity and all the things that really matter, become lost or disavowed; a world in which those who seemingly have a choice opt for dreary and overcast, rather than for blue skies and sunshine.Though the cinematography is superb and the settings lavish, the production team of Merchant/Ivory, who created and delivered such outstanding films as ""Howard's End"" and ""Remains of the Day,"" come up a bit short with this offering, which fairly plods along and simply takes too long to achieve very little in the way of insight or even just a satisfying cinematic experience.  And one of the main problems, perhaps, is the fact that the characters are people with whom you can neither identify nor relate, and as such, it is difficult to sympathize with their respective situations or to embrace their individual fixations.  These are people you simply have trouble caring about, and without that connection it puts you at arm's length, so to speak, and watching their story unfold becomes a tedious business at best.A valid argument could be made, as well, for the casting-- or should I say, ""miscasting""-- of the film, beginning with Nolte, who not only seems out of place (even playing an American), but gives a performance that seems forced and too overtly ""theatrical;"" this kind of acting belongs on the stage, and even there would stretch credibility.  It definitely does not translate well to film, and is simply not believable.  As he has proved in many films before, most notably in 1998's ""Affliction,""-- in which his performance was instrumental in enabling James Coburn to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor-- Nolte can act; but this just isn't the kind of role in which he excels.  Still, he must be given credit for the attempt.The usually charming and charismatic Beckinsale also falters in this one.  Like Nolte, her performance seems forced and lacks the naturalness that would've made it at all believable.  Perhaps in attempting to internalize her feelings, as one could argue would be appropriate for a young woman of the times depicted here, she may have used a bit too much restraint, which adversely affected the perception of her character and the emotions she was attempting to convey.  And when she does finally externalize her feelings, it just doesn't seem honest.Northam also fails to make his character, Amerigo, believable.  A good actor, one has to wonder at the reasons behind casting him as the Italian Prince.  His accent is decent, but far from impeccable, and the lapses have a tendency to take the viewer out of the story, which breaks the continuity and dispels the drama of the film.  And while not disastrous, it is unfortunate, and the film suffers for it.Uma Thurman probably comes closer than any of her co-stars at capturing the essence of her character, but even her performance comes across as rather tepid; physically and emotionally, she embodies Charlotte, but even her most flamboyant moments are lackluster.  And she and Northam lack the on-screen chemistry that would've created the tension needed to make the relationship between Charlotte and Amerigo a viable, believable commodity.The saving grace of the film, performance-wise, are those of Anjelica Huston and James Fox, in supporting roles as Fannie and Colonel Bob Assingham who, though in a limited capacity, give moments of the most credibility to the overall film.The supporting cast includes Madeleine Potter (Lady Castledean), Nicholas Day (Lord Castledean), Peter Eyre (Jarvis, the Shopkeeper), Nickolas Grace (Lecturer) and Robin Hart (Mr. Blint).  Visually resplendent, but overlong and far from engaging, ""The Golden Bowl"" fails to live up to the expectations of a Merchant/Ivory production.  To say that the story goes nowhere would be erroneous; it's simply a long, tiresome journey with an anticlimax that is less than satisfying.  A highly touted film, in the final analysis it can be chalked up as possibly the first misfire in the Merchant/Ivory canon.

If not, wait for something to come along with Emma Thompson or Helena Bonham-Carter, or anyone who has some business appearing in a costume drama, which no one in this movie does.Jeremy Northam is Amerigo, an Italian Prince who marries Maggie (Kate Beckinsale), daughter of ""America's First Billionaire"" (Nick Nolte).  Along comes Maggie's childhood friend and Amerigo's ex-lover Charlotte (Uma Thurman), who marries Maggie's father so that she can stay close to Amerigo and muck up everyone's happiness.The lead actors seem to have set aside any acting talent they may have once possessed in order to deliver their lines like first-year high-school drama class students (except for Beckinsale, who doesn't seem to have ever had any talent to set aside).  Uma Thurman bugs her eyes out and tries to carry off an odd amalgam of Bette Davis in ""Jezebel"" and Lucy Lawless in ""Xena: Warrior Princess"".  Nick Nolte's delivery is so stilted and deliberate, I suspect he may have thought he was getting paid by the hour.  Not to be missed is Jeremy Northam's ""Italian"" accent, which is so bad one expects him to burst forth with "" 'At's a spicy a-meatball! "" at any second. Speaking of bad accents, Angelica Houston is along for the ride, and her inflection mutates from Southern Belle to Regency country girl,  WITHIN A SINGLE SENTENCE.

It may tell more than you would like to know if you plan to watch it.This was a well filmed movie. The characters were alive. The actors were wonderful. The scenary was plush and captivating. The story draws you in... but in a very hypocritcal and contradictory fashion.If the goal was to get you to dislike adultery and have sympathy for wonderful people such as Maggie (Kate Beckinsale) and her father (Nick Nolte)... who were done wrong, then it was written completely wrong.The story is shown in the beginning from Charlotte (Uma Thurman) and Amerigo's (Jeremy Northam) viewpoint... so right away you have sympathy for Charlotte who is in love with Amerigo, in which her great friend Maggie is going to marry.Charlotte becomes a character you sympathize with greatly... and in fact you understand the drive behind all of her actions. She met the man, and fell in love with him before her friend even knew him.I couldn't help but like Charlotte through the entire movie. I found Maggie and her father--people who I would generally like and have respect for, to be very irritating and do-gooders to a point of irritation.If they weren't father and daughter you'd swear off they too had feelings with for one another. They were so close, it was actually quite unhealthy. I understand closeness... but their relationship... bordered dependency.As well, I can't say they didn't contribute to some of the actions on the part of Charlotte and Amerigo having an affair. They weren't to blame for it but I think they did indirectly cause some of the problems and their own unhappiness.You can't just neglect a relationship and expect it to be wonderful when you are good and ready to return to it. It takes sacrifice... and they weren't offering the right sort in order to receive what they wanted out of their relationships.As for Amerigo. I had no sympathy for him. He was kind, in his own right, made admirable sacrifices, but he was selfish. He spent time taking too much of what he wanted and when it finally caught up with him... he really didn't have to deal with the consequences.He got off easy while Charlotte took the burden of being a woman in love. That is a very similar outcome to reality and what most women have to deal with.In that aspect, it really sucked to watch this caring woman be treated and abused by this selfish man who didn't say no until it benefitted him later.Yeah, there were things I didn't agree with about Charlotte. Selfish things about her too. But at least you could see where she was coming from. That it wasn't her goal to be a bad person. She was just viewed as one because of her actions. But at least you could understand why she was doing what she was doing. She was in love.She met him first and and loved him first. And begged him not to marry Maggie before he ever did. She was completely relatable.I could not relate to Amerigo or Maggie's father much. I could relate to Maggie a bit, but not enough without her neurotic notions getting in the way. The woman worried to the point of being annoying.In the end it left Charlotte. She was outcasted in a manner and treated subtley as if it was all of her fault. Which I immensely disagreed with.If you ask me, Amerigo was way to blessed for his own good and he should've shared more of the consequences. In the end I couldn't label him as anything else but a jerk.Generally I would tell anyone who wanted to see this movie to avoid it... simply because it was irritating and the characters weren't really all that enjoyable to know and witness.Every single one of them were to blame for the consequences in their own way and that includes Angelica Houston's dislikable character who introduced Maggie and Amerigo, knowing full well about Charlotte beforehand.All of them got on my nerves... except the very person they wanted to blame everything on.

Although it is carefully dressed with stunning locations (Italy, London, et al.) and gorgeous production values, none of this can quite conceal what is ultimately the somewhat tedious retelling of James' story of love,betrayal,and cracked veneers in a film of laborious pace.The film goesto Angelica Huston and Nick Nolte.",3,The flawed veneer of the filmed novel,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2765,"['Golden', 'Bowl', 'perhaps', 'too', 'literally', 'form', 'structure', 'novel', 'expense', 'human', 'warmth', 'inner', 'life', 'characters', 'subtly', 'depicted', 'James.We', 'get', 'characters', 'mouthing', 'lines', 'well-rehearsed', 'speech.We', 'get', 'over-worked', 'device', 'bowl', 'planted', 'expository', 'contrived.taking', 'place', 'emotions', 'working', 'way', 'subconscious', 'lacking', 'necessary', 'synergy', 'chemistry', 'subtext.We', 'see', 'incestuous', 'closeness', 'father', 'daughter', 'Verver', 'Nolte', 'Beckinsdale', 'giving', 'adulterous', 'lovers', 'Charlotte', 'Thurman', 'Prince', 'Amerigo', 'Northam', 'more', 'chance', 'get', 'together', 'more', 'reason', '.One', 'too', 'conscious', 'suspension', 'disbelief.It', 'Merchant/Ivory/Jhabvala', 'team', 'passion', 'high-culture', 'sensibility', 'James', 'opposed', 'cruder', 'mass', 'culture', 'today', 'eclipsed', 'have', 'told', 'adapting', 'good/complex', 'novel', 'will', 'make', 'good', 'film.The', 'tragedy', 'story', 'too', 'explicit', 'screenplay', 'voices', 'feelings', 'remain', 'unspoken', 'novel', 'hidden', 'turned', 'soap', 'opera', 'thoughts', 'translated', 'speech.In', 'film', 'novel', 'Charlotte', 'centre', 'stage.The', 'plot', '4', 'people', 'father', 'daughter', 'great', 'wealth', 'two', 'penniless', 'lovers', 'combines', 'marriage.What', 'story', 'about', 'how', 'not', 'hurt', 'other', 'person', 'very', 'tricky', 'due', 'emotions', 'jealousy', 'acts', 'adultery.Fanny', 'Huston', 'lynchpin', 'holding', 'together', 'friend', 'protagonists', 'holding', 'secrets', 'former', 'lovers', 'father', 'daughter.Though', 'Maggie', 'out', 'Charlotte', 'Amerigo', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'love', 'gift', 'Golden', 'Bowl', 'purchases', 'Fanny', 'flaw', 'had', 'been', 'seen', 'Amerigo', 'making', 'reject', 'it.Adam', 'Nolte', 'dark', 'giving', 'hint', 'Charlotte', 'liaison', 'Amerigo', 'seeing', 'Charlotte.The', 'fearless', 'innocence', 'Maggie', 'youth', 'Gethsemane', 'watching', 'playing', 'cards', 'divines', 'appeal', 'save', 'them.Maggie', 'confronts', 'Charlotte', 'uncaged', 'beast', 'pride', 'serenity', 'Charlotte', 'can', 'not', 'provoke', 'Adam', 'return', 'America', 'Charlotte.Nolte', 'fantastic', 'gentleman', 'Beckinsdale', 'book', 'protagonist', 'wounded', 'dove', 'Northam', 'used', 'period', 'drama', 'slightly', 'machiavellian', 'performance', 'Thurman', 'so', 'busy', 'mouthing', 'lines', 'robotically', 'role', 'Winslett', 'Blanchett', 'would', 'have', 'acted', 'better', 'carefully', 'dressed', 'stunning', 'locations', 'Italy', 'London', 'al', 'gorgeous', 'production', 'values', 'none', 'can', 'quite', 'conceal', 'what', 'ultimately', 'somewhat', 'tedious', 'retelling', 'James', 'story', 'love', 'betrayal', 'cracked', 'veneers', 'film', 'laborious', 'pace.The', 'film', 'goesto', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'Nick', 'Nolte']",N/A

The result is, I think, rather closer to the former rather than to the latter; like Nicole Kidman as Isabel, the film expresses with gorgeous costumes and props, but lefts its heart somewhere behind.The story, very faithful to the original book, is comparatively simple.  &quot;Prince&quot; Amerigo (Jeremy Northam playing, unaccountably, an Italian) belongs to a once prosperous and  prestigious Italian family, which, however, is now finacially reduced.  He meets and keeps a romantic attachment with a beautiful woman Charlotte Stant (Uma Thurman, gorgeous as ever), but without enough money he decides to marry Maggie Verver (Kate Beckinsale), daughter of rich American tycoon and collector of  fine art Adam Verver (Nick Nolte), but still keeps on his clandestine meeting with Charlotte (who happens to be Maggie's best friend), who in turn married Adam.  This delicate equiliburium of secret love lasts only for a short time until an incident happens, when Maggie comes to realize that her husband is having an affair with her friend: until the titular golden bowl, apparently perfect, but deep inside flawed and cracked like the relations of the chracters here, shatters into pieces.The melodramatic (and some say banal) story of the book is preserved for most part, by the pen of Ruth Prawer Jhabvola, and probably no complaint would be heard from the fans of the original Henry James book.  However, as is the case with &quot;The Portrait of a Lady,&quot; it is also unlikely to convert film viewers to James fans, because the values described here is irrevocably dated.  No one, at least in the most part of Western culture today, would not look at the theme of adultery as the people in the film do.  You would think, looking at the tormented heroine such as Isabell Archer or Charotte Stant: If you don't like him, why don't you leave him?In fact, this is the point of the book, which deals with the unique situations of the people trapped in the mores of the high sphere of society, tracing how a certain set of people would act in a given time and place, according to the social and phychological codes ruling over them.  And now the film has a big trouble; in short, how can the movie interpret the subtle relations of the book (which, incidentally, is a very difficult to read, as every reader would find)?; how should the film present, before the more liberal modern audience, the believable characters that they can relate to, or at least, understand?The film, trying to overcome this problem, succeeds but not perfectly.  After Maggie realizes the truth about realtions between her husband and Charlotte, things start to change.  The people who know the truth -- Amerigo and Charlotte -- are now left in the dark while the people who didn't -- Maggie and Adam Verver -- start to gain power over the former pair.  The table has been turned, with the broken cup of gold, which is flawed....... and flawed as the film itself.  Charlotte and her husband go to American City, leaving behind Maggie and Amerigo, and thus Charlotte is virtually &quot;packed&quot; and &quot;sent&quot; to America where she will be buried alive for the rest of her life.  On the other hand, Amerigo goes back to her wife Maggie, with a &quot;Prince&quot;-like attitude, saying that he loves his wife, as if nothing had happened.  But he is also imprisoned in a family life he never cares.  This crucial part of the book is displayed so weakly that some may be left confused watching the ending of the film.This happens, I think, because of the film's cast: though Thurman and Northamm are good choice for the roles and fit in them pretty successfully, Nick Nolte and Kate Beckinsale are both greatly miscast: they just do not look like father and daughter who aodre each other.  And more to the point, both characters of father and daughter should be given, my impression after reading the book tells me, more ruthlessness, or even menace, in separating the lovers of Charlotte and Amerigo.  The fact is, they, father and daughter, conspire without saying that they need to conspire.  The tycoon father literally collects Charlotte, and that cruelty is in the book with a striking lasso image, which hangs around Charlotte's neck, and of which end Adam holds firmly.  Nolte briefly shows this side of the character when he silently and grimly supervises his wife's lecture about his pictures before the guests.  But it is not enough at all, and about Kate Beckinsale, her acting is, sorry fans, but far from satisfactory, to convince us the authenticity of the last confrontation scene between Maggie and Charlotte, which is not so much suggestive of her inner feeling, as simply confusing.All in all, the film is good; as you expect from Ivory's films, you see costumes and props that are delight to your eyes.  Still, the film shows unwittingly that some books cannot be made into film.  Probably, the most successful film adaptaion of the books of Henry James is Wyler's &quot;Heirness,&quot; which is based on &quot;Washington Square.&quot;  This gives, however, least of James's  taste.",3,"Like The Bowl of Title, The Film Is Beautiful, But Flawed",1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,5591,"['Long', 'made', 'film', 'versions', 'Henry', 'James', 'quot', 'Europeans', 'quot', 'quot',

I cheated and rented the movie and I enjoyed it well enough. At times Uma Thurman got on my nerves but it is not her fault as much as the character she portrayed-sneaky, manipulative, deceptive and unfaithful.  I was kept on the edge of my seat throughout though-trying to figure out how this tangled weave would become unspun. Happily, I was quite pleased with the outcome. It appears that morals stood up -or at least to a degree.  It is hard to truly understand what James had its characters really thinking and feeling throughout the movie. What was lie and what was truth, but it gave me more of an incentive to pick up the book and finish it to get better character analysis and insight. I loved the movie &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; and enjoyed Kidman more than Thurman. Nonetheless, this is a good movie to rent when snuggling in on a winters eve!

It begins very good and plunge you in some kind of life time story of a family. Scenario is very accurate and actings are great. Kate beckinsale had one of her earliest but best performances although she was very ugly in this movie. In converse, Uma Thurman was at her peak. she was amazing and sexy. The story is nothing new. A Couple who coudn't made it cause of money apparently. Charlotte and Amerigo. so they seperated each went on their own way. Amerigo intended to marry the daughter of a billionaire. accidently, daughter of the billilonaire is a friend of Charlotte's. Charlotte still loves Amerigo. so she penetrates into the billionaires family and accepts Mr. Verver's (Billionaire) marriage proposal. now Charlotte and Amerigo are Step-mother and Son in-law sow they can meet whitout making any suspition. seems like an old but great story. but it doen't continue this good. after a while Maggie (Daughter of the Billionaire) gets suspicious to her husbands realationship with charlotte. Some kind of ridicoulous event makes her sure. so she tells that to her husband. they hesitate on it. Amerigo who has married maggie only for her money, successes to fool maggie again and dumps charlotte in some way. at the end, Amerigo and Maggie have their own life and Mr. Verver and Charoltt have their own and the movie ends.
