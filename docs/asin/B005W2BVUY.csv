As far as video quality goes, I'm pretty pleased with it.  There was one scene (I believe it was in Kosuda's room) that I noticed a little bit of banding (still watching the rest of the episodes).  I can't say I have any issues with the audio.  My one big complaint is the crummy subtitles!  The text could stand to be a little larger, but that isn't my main issue with them.  The main issue I have with them is that they are solid white.  I never had much trouble reading these subtitles while watching FMA: BH, but there are a lot of scenes with lighter colors that make reading most difficult in this release.

Intimidated by experienced guys she decides to lose her virginity with another virgin and after running into Takashi at a bookstore she is sure she has found the man for the job. Now if she could only overcome her overwhelming insecurities she might actually achieve her lecherous goal.Initially disinterested due to the show's premise I decided to give it a chance when I saw it was available on Netflix. While I know men and women that have slept with numerous partners I have never met anyone that had intended or wanted to do so which is why I found the premise a little unbelievable, but after watching a few episodes my opinion changed. The show doesn't focus of Yamada sleeping around with numerous guys instead it focuses on her naivete, insecurities and attempts to lose her virginity.The animation is top notch, the characters are entertaining, the story is absolutely hilarious and the English dub is excellent! If you dislike crass or crude humor this show is probably not for you, but if you enjoy sex comedies you will most likely love it. This is not to say the show is explicit just the opposite it's the cleanest sex comedy I've ever seen I'm just saying it may not be for everyone!Be warned this anime contains very suggestive themes and a small amount of fan service so it is not suitable for children!

The story revolves around a 15 year old high school student and her quest to achieve sexual relations with 100 different people. However, her insecurities as a virgin, causes her to reject everyones who's asked her out and to search for someone, who's also a virgin, to bestow her first time to. The story revolves around Yamada and her quest to seduce Kosuda while along the way also finding her true love. This is the basic premise for this 12 episodes series. What makes this series funny, to me, are the inner feelings of Yamada and some of her friends. There's a lot of fan service but with no real nudity until the last episode which has two scenes, one in the first half and one in the second. I watched all episodes in Japanese with English subs but did try the English dub for about 10 minutes. They weren't bad but I just found the Japanese ones to be funnier. There were a scene or two that I had trouble reading the subs as they were white layered on top of a light background. Other than this, they were easily legible. I also watched both blu ray and DVD to see the differnce in the two. The blu rays were formatted to fit my TV nicely while the DVDs were shown in widescreen. As far as quality goes, there's no comparison. If you have a blu ray player, watch the blu ray. My only complaint would be I wish these companies would just sell them individually as this would probably save me an extra $10 or so as I have no intentions of ever watching it on DVD. Maybe they need to sell them in three formats, DVDs, blu rays and combo packs.The series comes in two DVD cases with one housing the DVDs and the other housing the blu rays. Both fit nicely into the cardboard outer box. The episdodes on the DVDs are split into 6 episodes each and the ones on the blu rays are split into 8 and 4. Both DVDs and blu rays have the exact same extras in that the first disc has an episode 1 commentary and the second has episode 11 commentary, outtakes, clean opening and closing credits and trailers. Extras were kind of weak to me as I wanted some cast interviews, linearts and stuff.

I guess this is suppose to be part of the humor of the show, the fact that they never actually accomplish anything, but for me its actually frustrating.  Towards the end of the series, they get close to accomplishing their goal many times, but in the end... it never happens!!  Very close but no cigar!  I can't believe the show ended like that.  I actually went online to check for a second season but it seems this is it.  Not that I would wanna go through another full season of watching these two try to have sex!  I guess I would have been more satisfied if he banged the hell outta her, but hey, this isnt hentai or anything.**spoilers over**All in all, its still entertaining.  So I still gave it 4 stars.  The show is very sexual in nature but at the same time nothing too graphic.  At the end of the series you see Yamada's breasts but thats about it.  This show does make me think back old middle school and high school days.  The days of innocence and inexperience with the opposite sex.  Awkward and funny stuff.  Its a short 12-episode series so I think its worth checking out if the premise sounds interesting to you...  A popular girl starting high school with a dream of banging 100 guys, and all the trials and tribulations that come along with just trying to achieve that first time.",4,Funny Premise!

1504326,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B005W2BVUY,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[87, 90]","Stop me if you've heard this one before, anime fans. A nerdy guy is a giant pervert, and goes to a school filled with voluptuous young ladies. His eventual goal is to get in close with them and score, but he ends up falling for the childhood friend/nerdy one/headstrong one. It's a formula that's been used time and time again, and for some reason, a lot of people seem to not get sick of it one bit. To put it lightly, I am not one of those people. But by taking the formula and replacing that guy with a cute girl, and adding in an extra bit of teen pathos, ""B Gata H Kei"" rises above the rest to a series that's hard not to recommend.Yamada is perhaps more perverted than even the boys in her school. Her life goal is to bed 100 guys before graduating high school, and with a whole wave of them wanting to get with her, one would figure that it wouldn't be that hard. But one would be mistaken, because the poor girl is clueless when it comes to seducing men, on account of the fact that actually having sex outside the context of romance makes her nervous to the point of blushing intensely. And so it ends up that her first ""victim"", an average Joe by the name of Kosuda, becomes somewhat of a love interest throughout the whole series. Yamada attempts to fornicate with him time and time again, but it always fails on account of her being too darn bashful for her own good.This seems like a set-up for a nonstop barrage of fan service, but what sets this show apart from the rest is how little of it there actually is. Panty shots are generally obscured, there's never any tasteless nudity, and the outfits the female characters are garbed in are far more modest those found in other series cut from similar cloths. No, ""B Gata H Kei"" is taste in it's visual content, which makes for an overall more enjoyable series to watch.All of the raciness had to go somewhere, of course, and that's where the completely R-rated dialogue comes in. People sensitive to explicit references to genitalia, consistent use of profanity, and a general mood of raunchiness should probably not watch this, if they were planning to anyway. Yamada is a walking encyclopedia of debauchery, possessing a vast knowledge of everything sexual except for how to actually engage in intercourse. The same can be said of her rival, Kanejo, who has a fake elegant front for her bizarre sexual interest in one of her close family members. The writers frequently make light of sex, incest and prurient interests, playing it off casually much like a Kevin Smith movie.Kevin Smith is perhaps the best comparison to this series for another reason as well. That's because underneath all of the riotous comedy and awkward shenanigans, this is really a human story. It's the classic ""girl-loves-boy"" story for my generation of youth, the generation who are glued to their computers, always connected, and spew off sexual dialogue like it's not offensive one bit. Personally, I relate to Yamada a good bit. Despite her grand ambitions (however ignoble they may be), she realizes that underneath her posturing, she's a normal girl who is susceptible to things such as hurt feelings and falling in love. There's a great deal of weakness inside of her, which makes her a far more compelling protagonist than ones from other erotic comedies. Her interactions with other characters often times feel, much like conversations I would have with friends. It really succeeds at painting a believable picture of today's teenagers.Also aiding the story are the side characters, who all serve a purpose. My personal favorite is Yamada's best friend Miharu, who acts as a sort of foil to her pal's daily antics and varying fits of sexual frustration and romantic confusion. She's one of the most tolerant and believable best friends I've personally ever seen in an anime. Also enjoyable is aforementioned love interest Kosuda, who is so painfully ordinary that it's funny. Everything from his face to his mannerisms are unforgettably vanilla, which ironically makes him very memorable. Other characters, like ""rivals"" Kanejo and Mayu, are all given their moments to shine, making for an inordinately balanced comedy.It would be a crime not to mention, however, that the two funniest side characters are actually inside Kosuda and Yamada themselves. Both of them possess an ""Eros Deity"", i.e. their secretly perverted consciousnesses. Yamada's is a chibi version of her, only with a giant grey mustache slapped on her face. She rides around on a little cloud and constantly yells at Yamada to be more aggressive, and frequently serves as a narrator. Kosuda's is also a chibi version of himself, but with perpetually closed eyes, that typically remains quiet but often serves as a metaphor for the poor boy getting an erection around Yamada. He even substitutes for Kosuda's actual genitalia at one point in the series, so that while Yamada sees his beans and franks, the viewer sees a little man on his crotch. The placement of these deities is always hilarious, and just another quirk that makes this series so good.On the technical side of things, ""B Gata H Kei"" isn't go to win any awards, but it's certainly not lackluster. The animation is very crisp, frequently shifting according to the narrative situation. There's never a noticeable dip in budget, making it consistently pleasant to look at throughout the entirety of the series. It also helps that the designs for all of the characters look incredibly attractive, even for the boys. There's some serious animated eye candy on display here, for those who care.What really won me over, though, was the music and voice acting. The opening and ending ditties are dangerously infectious, but nowhere near as much as the song ""B Gata H Kei"" that appears about three-quarters of the way through the show, which will be lodged in your cranium for months. The voice acting is also top-notch, with Yamada's voice actress shining above everybody else in both versions. Both Yukari Tamura and Brittney Karbowski bring something unique to the table with the character; Tamura emphasizes Yamada's innocent and demure interior, while Karbowski plays up the debauched side for the big laughs. Both versions work incredibly well, and the same can be said for the rest of both the English and Japanese casts.When it was released, many critics seemed to hate ""B Gata H Kei"", but average viewers adored it. Being one of those viewers, it's been interesting to see the critical opinion change somewhat over the course of almost two years. Well, interesting and gratifying, because ""B Gata H Kei"" is truly a good series, deserving of every bit of praise it gets. It succeeds as both a social satire of today's youth and a ribald sex comedy, with both sides getting equal treatment. Even with FUNimation's ludicrous price (which seems to be the norm for them nowadays), this is one series that is worth splurging on if you know what you're getting into. Not only a great comedy, but a great overall show.Story: B+Writing: B+Animation: B+Sound: A-Overall: B+",4,A Rare Authentic Sex Comedy,1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,7044,"['Stop', ""'ve"", 'heard',

1504343,A2BF3Z1UOWFBY,B005W2BVUY,Upright Ape,"[12, 17]","I can't add to any of the 5-star reviews in this thread.  They pretty much say it all, and for all the right reasons.  This a really fun anime to watch.My only con is the subtitles.  One of the other favorable reviews noted that sometimes the subtitles were difficult to see because they were white on a light colored background.  The reviewer found them legible otherwise.Unfortunately, I had to struggle with the ""otherwise"" scenes too.  The font size was too small, the outlines too thin, and the color completely wrong for many of the backgrounds.I'm one of those eccentrics who likes to watch these anime programs in Japanese with English subtitles.  I just enjoy Japanese voice acting more than English dubbing.  For this reason I've seen many anime with Japanese audio and subtitle tracks selected.  To my eyes, the best combination of properties for subtitles has been:font size: at least 12pts, as viewed on a 40-inch LCD TV from a distance of about 8 ft.font: arial bold or arial black, or any sans-serif font in boldcolor: yellowoutline: black, thick enough to be easily seen on as many different colored backgrounds as possible.  This property is a little tough to quantify.  Decent quality assurance would have to verify what works best on a frame-by-frame basis.I don't know why, but yellow subtitles have worked the best against most colored backgrounds - even yellow, provided the letters are outlined in black.  White letters with black outlines, on the other hand, are difficult if not impossible to see on many light-colored backgrounds.In fact, I give Yamada's subtitling ZERO STARS.  I've never seen subtitles this poorly done.  However, the program itself was so well done that I had to boost the average rating from 2-1/2 to 4 stars.Also, I'm sure different viewers will have different experiences with those subtitles, and that their experiences will be 5-star.But if you're like me (whether or not you write in sentence fragments) as far as enjoying Japanese voice acting goes, you may have to watch parts or all of some episodes with the English dub turned on. Fortunately this is one of those productions that floats the disc menu above the program in progress, so you can easily change the language setup in real-time.  That's another good reason to boost the average from 2-1/2 to 4 stars in spite of the terrible subtitles.Bottom line: Yamada's First Time is one of the best anime I've ever seen, and in one respect one of the worst, all in one package.  It was well worth watching for those ""best"" parts.UpRight Ape",4,"Great series, great production, except....",1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,2546,"['ca', ""n't"", 'add', '5-star', 'reviews', 'thread', 'pretty', 'much', 'say', 'right', 'reasons', 'really', 'fun', 'anime', 'watch.My', 'only', 'con', 'subtitles', 'One', 'other', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'noted', 'subtitles', 'were', 'difficult', 'see', 'were', 'white', 'light', 'colored', 'background', 'reviewer', 'found', 'legible', 'otherwise.Unfortunately', 'had', 'struggle', 'otherwise', 'scenes', 'too', 'font', 'size', 'was', 'too', 'small', 'outlines', 'too', 'thin', 'color', 'completely', 'wrong', 'many', 'backgrounds.I', ""'m"", 'one', 'eccentrics', 'who', 'likes', 'watch', 'anime', 'programs', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'just', 'enjoy', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'more', 'English', 'dubbing', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'anime', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'subtitle', 'tracks', 'selected', 'eyes', 'best', 'combination', 'properties', 'subtitles', 'been', 'font', 'size', 'least', '12pts', 'viewed', '40-inch', 'LCD', 'TV', 'distance', '8', 'ft.font', 'arial', 'bold', 'arial', 'black', 'sans-serif', 'font', 'boldcolor', 'yellowoutline', 'black', 'thick', 'enough', 'be', 'easily', 'seen', 'many', 'different', 'colored', 'backgrounds', 'possible', 'property', 'little', 'tough', 'quantify', 'Decent', 'quality', 'assurance', 'would', 'have', 'verify', 'what', 'best', 'frame-by-frame', 'basis.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'yellow', 'subtitles', 'have', 'worked', 'best', 'most', 'colored', 'backgrounds', 'even', 'yellow', 'provided', 'letters', 'are', 'outlined', 'black', 'White', 'letters', 'black', 'outlines', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'see', 'many', 'light-colored', 'backgrounds.In', 'fact', 'give', 'Yamada', 'subtitling', 'ZERO', 'STARS', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'subtitles', 'poorly', 'done', 'However', 'program', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'had', 'boost', 'average', 'rating', '2-1/2', '4', 'stars.Also', ""'m"", 'sure', 'different', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'experiences', 'subtitles', 'experiences', 'will', 'be', '5-star.But', ""'re"", 'not', 'write', 'sentence', 'fragments', 'as', 'far', 'enjoying', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'may', 'have', 'watch', 'parts', 'episodes', 'English', 'dub', 'turned', 'Fortunately', 'one', 'productions', 'floats', 'disc', 'menu', 'program', 'progress', 'can', 'easily', 'change', 'language', 'setup', 'real-time', 'good', 'reason', 'boost', 'average', '2-1/2', '4', 'stars', 'spite', 'terrible', 'subtitles.Bottom', 'line', 'Yamada', 'First', 'Time', 'one', 'best', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'respect', 'one', 'worst', 'one', 'package', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'best', 'parts.UpRight', 'Ape']",N/A
