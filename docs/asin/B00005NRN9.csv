The rest was lovely but they were all acts that can bee seen on other discs with other shows.IS the premise  a bit juvenile? Well yes it is but it was made BEFORE 9/11 so in fact it IS very 9/10 as someone arrogantly put it. And frankly Cirque is not an American company so even if this were made after 9/11 why must it reflect the jaded and negative nature that has come to pervade our nations attitude?This film is a lovely bit of fluff with no extras to speak of and nothing except recycled acts.

669826,A1XBP1VWV92MQQ,B00005NRN9,"Duane ""Real World""","[2, 5]","First let me say that there is 3D and then there is 3D.  I have purchased and enjoyed this disk using a Samsung 61 inch ""3D Ready"" DLP TV.  This is an important distinction.  My TV uses the ""checkerboard"" format rather than the 3D Blu-Ray standard.  This checkerboard format is, in most respects, superior to that which you get on the new 3D TV's.  This may account for the negative reviews from owners of the newer sets.  The 3D is also superior to that which you saw in the original IMAX 3D theatre release.  That is because theatres use passive 3D glasses rather than active. The difference in depth is substantial.  The 3D, for example, in ""Polar Express"" is disappointing even in IMAX, but, placed on the home screen, is dramatic.  Having said this, I can report that the friends with whom I have watched this on our system are simply amazed.  This is Cirque as it should be.  I have some quibbles with the way they have depicted the ""Journey of Man"", but these can be reduced to artistic differences and the film should be enjoyed on its own merit.  I would also say that I have lent the film to friends with the official Blu-Ray format and the results are no where near as good.  We are at the mercy of decisions made by big corporations.  From what I have been able to read, the checkerboard format was too expensive to incorporate in plasma TV's, so it was abandoned. Plasma was not as good as DLP, but corporations had huge investments to recoup.  So, they sold it to the public.  We are all the poorer for this. (Please note: Mitsubishi still offers checkerboard and all new Panasonic Blu-Ray 3D players now incorporate this technology.  I believe that this is a bow to its superiority for the home viewer.  You will find both on Amazon.)  In any event, this is good news for ""3D Ready"" set owners and lovers of Cirque. For folks who own other technology, try it.  If it works, you are in for a great viewing experience.",5,This disk is fabulous - with a caveat or two.,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,1931,"['First', 'let', 'say', '3D', 'then', '3D', 'have', 'purchased', 'enjoyed', 'disk', 'using', 'Samsung', '61', 'inch', '3D', 'Ready', 'DLP', 'TV', 'important', 'distinction', 'My', 'TV', 'checkerboard', 'format', 'rather', '3D', 'Blu-Ray', 'standard', 'checkerboard', 'format', 'most', 'respects', 'superior', 'get', 'new', '3D', 'TV', 'may', 'account', 'negative', 'reviews', 'owners', 'newer', 'sets', '3D', 'also', 'superior', 'saw', 'original', 'IMAX', '3D', 'theatre', 'release', 'theatres', 'use', 'passive', '3D', 'glasses', 'rather', 'active', 'difference', 'depth', 'substantial', '3D', 'example', 'Polar', 'Express', 'disappointing', 'even', 'IMAX', 'placed', 'home', 'screen', 'dramatic', 'Having', 'said', 'can', 'report', 'friends', 'whom', 'have', 'watched', 'system', 'are', 'simply', 'amazed', 'Cirque', 'should', 'be', 'have', 'quibbles', 'way', 'have', 'depicted', 'Journey', 'Man', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'artistic', 'differences', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'own', 'merit', 'would', 'also', 'say', 'have', 'lent', 'film', 'friends', 'official', 'Blu-Ray', 'format', 'results', 'are', 'where', 'near', 'good', 'are', 'mercy', 'decisions', 'made', 'big', 'corporations', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'read', 'checkerboard', 'format', 'was', 'too', 'expensive', 'incorporate', 'plasma', 'TV', 'was', 'abandoned', 'Plasma', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'DLP', 'corporations', 'had', 'huge', 'investments', 'recoup', 'So', 'sold', 'public', 'are', 'poorer', 'Please', 'note', 'Mitsubishi', 'still', 'checkerboard', 'new', 'Panasonic', 'Blu-Ray', '3D', 'players', 'now', 'incorporate', 'technology', 'believe', 'bow', 'superiority', 'home', 'viewer', 'will', 'find', 'Amazon', 'event', 'good', 'news', '3D', 'Ready', 'set', 'owners', 'lovers', 'Cirque', 'folks', 'who', 'own', 'other', 'technology', 'try', 'are', 'great', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

How excited I was as I plopped the disk into my DVD player and sat back in joyous expectation of an hour or maybe 90 minutes of the sort of pure entertainment found in other Cirque du Soleil titles. We put a pizza in the oven. By the time the pizza was done, so was the damn film!Journey of man is a visual feast for the eye but a famine for content. It is beautifully filmed in natural settings that appeal to my Pagan little heart. Moving from the sea, to a forest, to a rocky desert, it is visually entertaining. We move on to what appears almost like a Roman villa with classical  statuary, which turn out to be performers who deliver an impressive strength demonstration. Then we move on to a stylish set that might conjure in the mind a more modern estate for the closing performance.The problem is, that closing performance comes surprisingly soon. I was taken aback at how quickly the whole thing was over and done with. I thought I must be mistaken. I grabbed the shuck and checked the table of contents. Nope. There were no lurking &quot;additional&quot; scenes. No expanded version. I checked the running time, and it claimed the whole thing should run appx 39 minutes.39 minutes! That's a grand total, folks. 39 whole, complete, total minutes! That includes the credits.As I sat, feasting on pizza, I was disappointed right out of my skull with the famine of content found (or should I say 'not found') in Journey of Man. It was like a bad case of &quot;visualis interruptus!&quot;Meanwhile, the basic premise that everything would be simply peachy if the world would break down and embrace &quot;dreams, faith and love&quot; struck me as horribly naive. How Septermber 10th! It is nearly as Pollyanna as Bush's claim our economy is fundamentally sound!Caveat Emptor ~ the film is great visually, too bleeding short and stingy of content, has a message to deliver that is inherently juvenile and only 39 total minutes.Being armed with this information, you make your own decision. It is a mixed blessing, feast or famine.Investing in this DVD is the electronic equivalent of purchasing WorldCom or Enron stock!Personally, I strongly recommend other titles in the C du S line.",3,Feast?

When I received it, it was played on a58"" Panasonic Viera 3D Full High Definition TV + a Panasonic Threatre Sound System combinedwith an ORB Audio System; but still I was dismay about the 3D effects qualities of this disc (need tosay that that I can't bet of receiving a dude copy).Unliked to the Cirque du Soleil stage show, the underwater swimming synchronization wasexcellent but its surrounded environment was that cloudly as if it was videotaped in a dirty cow-trough; the forest captures were as if made by a cheap filmmaker's camera; and only fair few otherparts of the movie pertaining to rocky & hilly natural scenery were in 3D effects (but in depthONLY, never came out of the screen); and the beautifully related ""Journey of man""story lines thataccompany the performances was cramped into a 39 minutes ""Much Ado about Nothing"" dullmovie with seasonal 3D effects.  As I see it, Cirque Du Soleil had been discredited by the release ofits performances in that 3D version.
