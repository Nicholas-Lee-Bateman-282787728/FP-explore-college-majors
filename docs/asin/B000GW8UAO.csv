After the nightmare of the season 2 box set, wherein a few episodes would stop/freeze or simply not play at all (see the Amazon reviews), they finally rectified the error of their ways. The only puzzling thing is that Universal still decided to keep the bulky snap cases instead of the slim cases for the set, which does take up a lot of room on your DVD shelf.

While sometimes unfairly pigeonholed as a show that only people above a certain age can appreciate, I've found that this is endlessly rewatchable, highly entertaining programming for *everyone.* Few things make me happier than seeing how people of all generations and TV tastes can unite around a mutual affection for this eminently enjoyable, timeless gem!Unlike most of today's eye-rollingly slick, ""edgy"" shows that rely on high tech gizmos and gore, Murder, She Wrote's mysteries were the type of which the brilliant Dame Agatha Christie would approve, relying on the timeless tools of deductive reasoning and knowledge of human nature. Granted, most of these mysteries aren't as brilliantly plotted and paced as Christie's, but whose are?! Given the more limiting one-hour TV format, I found the majority of MSW's mysteries highly satisfying.This show remains engaging and well worth watching even after you already know 'whodunit'. How many mystery shows can one say THAT about?! As fellow fans have noted, there's joy in (re-)watching these fine actors' performances, identifying some of the best guest stars ever assembled, and especially in ""visiting"" the show's varied locales, most notably the cozy (albeit lethal!) enclave of Cabot Cove.The show contains heartwarming humor, an infectiously positive energy, and never gets bogged down in the tiresome romantic 'angst' that sinks so many other shows. Is it a touch corny? Absolutely! Yet somehow that's an asset here, contributing to the show's uniquely cozy charm.Best of all, there's something truly inspiring about a heroine who's neither young nor reliant on romantic relationships for her fulfillment, yet still leads a remarkably rich, full and happy life. It's sad how few fictional heroines fit that description!If, like me, you're on too tight a budget to splurge on all 12 seasons, I would bump Season 4 to the top of your 'must own' list. As others have noted, the Cabot Cove-based episodes tend to be MSW's very best, and this season happens to feature some of the most eminently rewatchable Cabot Cove episodes of the whole series. We're also treated to a couple of highly amusing appearances by Grady, Jessica's hapless but adorably well-meaning nephew. Nearly every single episode this season represents Murder She Wrote at its most sublimely pleasurable. I've watched this season an embarrassing number of times (don't ask!), and somehow it never, ever gets old.I truly believe this is a series well worth owning and passing on from one generation to the next. I'm confident that most of my fellow mystery fans, regardless of age, will cherish this series as much as I do!",5,If I had to choose just one season...,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,2848,"['are', 'sadly', 'few', 'series', 'manage', 'maintain', 'high', 'level', 'quality', 'even', 'three', 'four', 'seasons', 'so', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'ability', 'consistently', 'delight', '12', 'especially', 'laudable', 'sometimes', 'unfairly', 'pigeonholed', 'show', 'only', 'people', 'certain', 'age', 'can', 'appreciate', ""'ve"", 'found', 'endlessly', 'rewatchable', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'programming', '*everyone', 'Few', 'things', 'make', 'happier', 'seeing', 'how', 'people', 'generations', 'TV', 'tastes', 'can', 'unite', 'around', 'mutual', 'affection', 'eminently', 'enjoyable', 'timeless', 'gem', 'most', 'today', 'eye-rollingly', 'slick', 'edgy', 'rely', 'high', 'tech', 'gizmos', 'gore', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'mysteries', 'were', 'type', 'brilliant', 'Dame', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'would', 'approve', 'relying', 'timeless', 'tools', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'knowledge', 'human', 'nature', 'Granted', 'most', 'mysteries', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'brilliantly', 'plotted', 'paced', 'Christie', 'are', 'more', 'limiting', 'one-hour', 'TV', 'format', 'found', 'majority', 'MSW', 'mysteries', 'highly', 'satisfying.This', 'show', 'engaging', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'already', 'know', ""'whodunit"", 'How', 'many', 'mystery', 'shows', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'about', 'fellow', 'fans', 'have', 'noted', 'joy', 're-', 'watching', 'fine', 'actors', 'performances', 'identifying', 'best', 'guest', 'stars', 'ever', 'assembled', 'especially', 'visiting', 'show', 'varied', 'locales', 'most', 'notably', 'cozy', 'lethal', 'enclave', 'Cabot', 'Cove.The', 'show', 'heartwarming', 'humor', 'infectiously', 'positive', 'energy', 'never', 'bogged', 'down', 'tiresome', 'romantic', ""'angst"", 'sinks', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'touch', 'corny', 'Absolutely', 'somehow', 'asset', 'here', 'contributing', 'show', 'uniquely', 'cozy', 'charm.Best', 'something', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'heroine', 'who', 'young', 'reliant', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'fulfillment', 'yet', 'still', 'remarkably', 'rich', 'full', 'happy', 'life', 'sad', 'how', 'few', 'fictional', 'heroines', 'fit', 'description', ""'re"", 'too', 'tight', 'budget', 'splurge', '12', 'seasons', 'would', 'bump', 'Season', '4', 'top', 'own', 'list', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'Cabot', 'Cove-based', 'episodes', 'tend', 'be', 'MSW', 'very', 'best', 'season', 'feature', 'most', 'eminently', 'rewatchable', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'episodes', 'whole', 'series', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'couple', 'highly', 'amusing', 'appearances', 'Grady', 'Jessica', 'hapless', 'adorably', 'well-meaning', 'nephew', 'Nearly', 'single', 'episode', 'season', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'most', 'sublimely', 'pleasurable', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'season', 'embarrassing', 'number', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'somehow', 'never', 'ever', 'old.I', 'truly', 'believe', 'series', 'well', 'owning', 'passing', 'one', 'generation', 'next', ""'m"", 'confident', 'most', 'fellow', 'mystery', 'fans', 'regardless', 'age', 'will', 'cherish', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'do']",N/A

As a kid I first saw her in MURDER, SHE WROTE and was always impressed how she managed to make each show interesting without the need for things found in most modern television shows, namely graphic violence, foul language, and sexual innuendo.  Each episode was more of a character study than other shows of the time, focusing more on the relationships between one person and another than allowing each death to come off as some random act of violence.In any event, this show is truly marvelous due in large part to Ms. Lansbury's performance.  While the first three seasons on DVD were released on double-sided discs, this season has finally been released on single-sided ones.  Hopefully this will improve the playback quality, as many viewers (myself included) had problems with the dual-sided discs not playing correctly.

1007838,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000GW8UAO,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[60, 60]","The baffling crimes and mysteries continue with season four of ""Murder, She Wrote"". Angela Lansbury returns for a fourth season as famed mystery novelist and crime solver Jessica Fletcher, as she continues to find out ""whodunit"" when murders keep popping up around her. Just like with seasons one, two, and three, season four is a winner again. Intriguing mysteries, plus a delightful sense of humor, add up to another terrific season. And let's not forget about another great acting job by Lansbury in each episode. Jessica Fletcher was a role tailor-made just for her.As usual, many well-known actors from the big screen to the small screen turn up in guest spots on ""Murder, She Wrote"". They include: Eileen Brennan (""Private Benjamin""), Nancy Dussault (""Too Close for Comfort""), Christopher Hewett (""Mr. Belvedere""), Yaphet Kotto (""Alien""), Betty Garrett (""All in the Family""), Jennifer Salt (""Soap""), Janet Leigh (""Psycho""), Charlotte Rae (""The Facts of Life""), Anne Meara (""Archie Bunker's Place""), Jeffrey Tambor (""Arrested Development""), Jane Badler (""V""), Rene Auberjonois (""Benson""), Robert Reed (""The Brady Bunch""), Lois Nettleton (""In the Heat of the Night""), Linda Purl (""Matlock""), Billy Zane (""Titanic""), Eli Wallach (""The Godfather: Part III""), John Saxon (""A Nightmare on Elm Street""), Sonny Bono (""The Sonny and Cher Show""), Norman Fell (""Three's Company""), Brenda Vaccaro (""Midnight Cowboy""), Kristy McNichol (""Empty Nest""), Dean Stockwell (""Quantum Leap""), Eddie Albert (""Green Acres""), and Shirley Jones (""The Partridge Family""). Tom Bosley is back for a couple of episodes as Cabot Cove Sheriff Amos Tupper, as well as William Windom as Cabot Cove doctor Seth Hazlitt. This was Bosley's last season as Sheriff Tupper on ""Murder, She Wrote"". After the fourth season of the show ended the former ""Happy Days"" star took a lead role in the short-lived series ""Father Dowling Mysteries"", which made its TV debut in January 1989, just as ""Murder, She Wrote"" was halfway through its fifth season. So a new Cabot Cove Sheriff gets introduced in season five. But Bosley's appearances in 18 episodes of ""Murder, She Wrote"" through the first four seasons were a high point of the show, and his presence will be missed in season five and beyond. His final ""Murder, She Wrote"" episode is the one titled ""Benedict Arnold Slipped Here"" (episode #18).For me the best episodes of ""Murder, She Wrote"" season four are: ""Witness for the Defense"", ""If it's Thursday, It Must be Beverly"", ""Steal Me a Story"", ""Indian Giver"", ""Doom With a View"", ""Who Threw the Barbitals in Mrs. Fletcher's Chowder?"", ""Curse of the Daanav"", ""A Very Good Year For Murder"", ""Showdown in Saskatchewan"", ""Deadpan"", and ""The Body Politic"". Also excellent is the bonus episode from season five, titled ""Snow White, Blood Red"". This is a gripping and suspenseful episode that takes place at a snowy ski resort, with a killer on the loose in the middle of a blizzard, and none of the guests can get out because all the roads outside are snowed in. Look for this superior episode to turn up in ""Murder, She Wrote"" - The Complete Fifth Season when it comes out on DVD.But for right now, ""Murder, She Wrote"" - The Complete Fourth Season is a must for mystery fans. If you liked the first three seasons, then you'll like season four too. Plus, the new DVD format set is much improved over the previous three DVD sets of ""Murder, She Wrote"" (seasons 1, 2, & 3), which has three disks with episodes that are played on both sides of the disks. For season four, there are five disks, and the episodes are played on only one side. This comes after many complaints over the bad DVD quality of the first three seasons of the show.

I have faithfully followed all the seasons, and Season Four [1987-88] is as entertaining as ever. I have to say that though I love all the locations for the stories, my favorite is Cabot Cove, Maine and I just adore the quirky townspeople and the scandals around them!In Season Four, we have some noted guest stars such as John Glover, Dack Rambo, Janet Leigh, Linda Purl, Eli Wallach, Billy Zane, Sonny Bono etc. With such talents abounding in each episode, its no wonder that watching this series is such a pleasure! The stories are creative and well-written, with a cohesive plotline and of course, stellar acting.Of course, the regulars are a hoot to watch as well! Angela Lansbury is flawless in her role as super sleuth J.B. Fletcher, and there are of course Tom Bosley as Sheriff Amos Tupper, William Windom as Dr Seth Hazlitt, Richard Paul as mayor Sam Booth, Jerry orbach as PI Harry McGraw etc.Angela Lansbury s such a talented actress and continues to amaze till today [at 82!]. What I love most about her portrayal of J.B. Fletcher is that she plays a strong, intelligent, and attractive middle-aged lady [such roles are so scarce in Hollywood], and managed to entertain audiences for 12 years in her most-famous screen role!
