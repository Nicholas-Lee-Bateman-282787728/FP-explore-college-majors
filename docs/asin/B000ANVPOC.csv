929084,A1U2KLNT1TJEUF,B000ANVPOC,biped,"[12, 15]","If you're looking for a creepy horror flick about a woman who is terrorized by a killer in her house, like the title and the cover art of this DVD suggest, look elsewhere.  This made-for-TV thriller, filmed for the ""Lifetime"" channel and Canadian cable-TV, is a hybrid of the murder/suspense and ""woman-in-jeopardy"" genres, and a pretty standard one at that.  It's about a woman (Tracy Nelson) whose troubled teenage son is charged with a murder he didn't commit -- he apparently killed the married woman who was having an affair with him -- and since it appears to be such an open-and-shut case, with all evidence pointing squarely at her son, she must investigate the case herself and find the real killer at great risk of her own life.This is the sort of movie that you might find yourself watching if it comes on the TV and you don't feel like mustering the energy to lift the remote control.  It's good enough to hold your interest if you're in the right mood, but nothing worth seeking out or adding to your DVD collection.  The actual killer is revealed about halfway through the movie, but if you don't figure out who is really behind the murder the instant this character walks onscreen, well...",2,"An okay flick if you catch it on TV, but...",1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,1204,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'creepy', 'horror', 'flick', 'woman', 'who', 'terrorized', 'killer', 'house', 'title', 'cover', 'art', 'DVD', 'suggest', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'made-for-TV', 'thriller', 'filmed', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'Canadian', 'cable-TV', 'hybrid', 'murder/suspense', 'woman-in-jeopardy', 'genres', 'pretty', 'standard', 'one', 'woman', 'Tracy', 'Nelson', 'troubled', 'teenage', 'son', 'charged', 'murder', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'apparently', 'killed', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'be', 'such', 'open-and-shut', 'case', 'evidence', 'pointing', 'squarely', 'son', 'must', 'investigate', 'case', 'find', 'real', 'killer', 'great', 'risk', 'own', 'life.This', 'sort', 'movie', 'might', 'find', 'watching', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'mustering', 'energy', 'lift', 'remote', 'control', 'good', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', ""'re"", 'right', 'mood', 'nothing', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'adding', 'DVD', 'collection', 'actual', 'killer', 'revealed', 'halfway', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'murder', 'instant', 'character', 'onscreen', 'well']",N/A
