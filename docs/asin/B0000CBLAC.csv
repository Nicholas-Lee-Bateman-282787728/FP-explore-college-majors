Season 4 ended with the Taelons and Jaridians merging in some volcanic chamber, and then bang.Ok, so now we have season 5.  Augur is mysteriously gone for good after barely making an appearance in season 4.  Instead we have Street, who just wasn't given the right material.  But whatever.  Here's the kicker.THE ENTIRE STORYLINE set up in the first 4 seasons is tossed aside without a thought.  All the work done with the Taelons and the Jaridians, gone without any meaning.  Done, gone, the end.  No more Taelons (except the one guy who got away somehow), no more Jaridians.  No more Liam till the last episode where he just shows up without explanation.What happened to the Jaridians that got away?  From the website ""When the Jaridians board the Mothership, they find themselves trapped in a force field set by Ronald Sandoval (Von Flores). He strikes a deal, promising to lead them to the Taelons if they spare Earth and elect him ruler of the planet. Sandoval and the Jardians make their way to a portal, just as Hubble opens fire on the ship. As Sandoval collapses, badly wounded, Vorjak and the others escape.""  If they escaped, where are they??Instead they go on with this ridiculous plotline about the Atavus, who look NOTHING like the way they did when Da'an turned into one, instead they come across as leather freaks into S&M; and vampirism.  Yes we get to see Zo'or in a catsuit.  Wow.  And then she dies stupidly.  Yes Boone comes back.  But he dies.  Stupidly.  Off screen.  He gets a one liner about how he died heroically, blah blah blah.Every other story set up over the 4 years, gone.  This season attempts to create a whole new story arc and fails miserably.  Go ahead and buy it, its cheap.  But don't expect to be happy.",2,"Please read this before judging review ""not helpful""",1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,1905,"['watched', 'single', 'episode', 'EFC', 'followed', 'plot', 'lines', 'carefully', 'so', 'believe', 'when', 'tell', 'season', '5', 'insulting', 'slap', 'face', 'Season', '4', 'ended', 'Taelons', 'Jaridians', 'merging', 'volcanic', 'chamber', 'then', 'bang.Ok', 'so', 'now', 'have', 'season', '5', 'Augur', 'mysteriously', 'gone', 'good', 'barely', 'making', 'appearance', 'season', '4', 'Instead', 'have', 'Street', 'who', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'right', 'material', 'Here', 'kicker.THE', 'ENTIRE', 'STORYLINE', 'set', 'up', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'tossed', 'aside', 'thought', 'work', 'done', 'Taelons', 'Jaridians', 'gone', 'meaning', 'Done', 'gone', 'end', 'more', 'Taelons', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'away', 'somehow', 'more', 'Jaridians', 'more', 'Liam', 'till', 'last', 'episode', 'where', 'just', 'up', 'explanation.What', 'happened', 'Jaridians', 'got', 'away', 'website', 'When', 'Jaridians', 'board', 'Mothership', 'find', 'trapped', 'force', 'field', 'set', 'Ronald', 'Sandoval', 'Von', 'Flores', 'deal', 'promising', 'lead', 'Taelons', 'spare', 'Earth', 'elect', 'ruler', 'planet', 'Sandoval', 'Jardians', 'make', 'way', 'portal', 'just', 'Hubble', 'opens', 'fire', 'ship', 'Sandoval', 'collapses', 'badly', 'wounded', 'Vorjak', 'others', 'escape', 'escaped', 'where', 'are', 'Instead', 'go', 'ridiculous', 'plotline', 'Atavus', 'who', 'look', 'NOTHING', 'way', 'did', 'when', ""Da'an"", 'turned', 'one', 'instead', 'come', 'leather', 'freaks', 'S', 'M', 'vampirism', 'Yes', 'get', 'see', ""Zo'or"", 'catsuit', 'Wow', 'then', 'stupidly', 'Yes', 'Boone', 'back', 'Stupidly', 'Off', 'screen', 'one', 'liner', 'how', 'died', 'heroically', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah.Every', 'other', 'story', 'set', 'up', '4', 'years', 'gone', 'season', 'create', 'whole', 'new', 'story', 'arc', 'miserably', 'Go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'cheap', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'happy']",N/A
