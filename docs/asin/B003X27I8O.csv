1369702,A17WB4MQVR95HA,B003X27I8O,Dude,"[1, 1]","This is a very demented yet hilariously funny show.  If you havent' seen it before you need to watch a few episodes on FX before you buy it to be sure it doesn't offend you. It is also on other channels but is edited.  Somehow FX doesn't have to edit out the profanity/slight nudity (usually some dudes butt). This is definately not a show for people under 18, although their packaging rating says 14.Now regarding the multi-pack purchased, it comes in a simulated ""6 pack"". Some people have commented that it is a cheap cardboard box, but that is kind of misleading. Yes the box is a waxed cardboard with pics of a 6 pack, but it is of good quality (it's not fall apart cheap). There is also extra room in the box where I have put my season 6 DVD and there is still room for season 7 when it becomes available, allowing me to save shelf space.  The dvd's are all FULL SCREEN except for season 5 and the Christmas special, which are widescreen. Amazon incorrectly advertises that the whole set is widescreen. The full screen picture takes up my entire 50"" screen though, without the black sidebars around the pic.  It is evident in season 1 that it was a new show, as the picture quality is ever so slightly bad.  That is it is not as clear and bright as what season two and later seasons are, hence my 4 star rating, otherwise it would have been 5 star. If you are using an upconverting blue ray player you probably won't notice that. I still have a pre-blue ray, pre-HD, DVD player/recorder, with an HD plasma t.v. . If you appreciate demented humor and aren't offended by profanity, sexual commentary/situations, racial observations, stereotyping, some gore (fake blood, spit, puke, etc..)by all means you need to become a ""Sunny"" fan and buy this set!",4,"Demented, funny humor",1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,1755,"['very', 'demented', 'yet', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'show', 'havent', 'seen', 'need', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', 'FX', 'buy', 'be', 'sure', ""n't"", 'offend', 'also', 'other', 'channels', 'edited', 'Somehow', 'FX', ""n't"", 'have', 'edit', 'out', 'profanity/slight', 'nudity', 'usually', 'dudes', 'butt', 'definately', 'not', 'show', 'people', '18', 'packaging', 'rating', '14.Now', 'regarding', 'multi-pack', 'purchased', 'simulated', '6', 'pack', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'cheap', 'cardboard', 'box', 'kind', 'misleading', 'Yes', 'box', 'waxed', 'cardboard', 'pics', '6', 'pack', 'good', 'quality', 'not', 'fall', 'apart', 'cheap', 'also', 'extra', 'room', 'box', 'where', 'have', 'put', 'season', '6', 'DVD', 'still', 'room', 'season', '7', 'when', 'available', 'allowing', 'save', 'shelf', 'space', 'dvd', 'are', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'season', '5', 'Christmas', 'special', 'are', 'widescreen', 'Amazon', 'incorrectly', 'whole', 'set', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', 'picture', 'up', 'entire', '50', 'screen', 'black', 'sidebars', 'pic', 'evident', 'season', '1', 'was', 'new', 'show', 'picture', 'quality', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'bad', 'not', 'clear', 'bright', 'what', 'season', 'two', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'hence', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', '5', 'star', 'are', 'using', 'upconverting', 'blue', 'ray', 'player', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'still', 'have', 'pre-blue', 'ray', 'pre-HD', 'DVD', 'player/recorder', 'HD', 'plasma', 't.v', 'appreciate', 'demented', 'humor', 'are', ""n't"", 'offended', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'commentary/situations', 'racial', 'observations', 'stereotyping', 'gore', 'fake', 'blood', 'spit', 'puke', 'etc..', 'means', 'need', 'become', 'Sunny', 'fan', 'buy', 'set']",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: Complete Seasons 1-5 + A Very Sunny Christmas Special

This is an ensemble show, with 5 main characters. All 5 are incredibly talented. It's not like other ensemble shows like Taxi, which was a great show...but had a few weak characters. Any of the characters on Sunny could be the funniest one on just about any other sitcom. They work together like clockwork. The dialogue is snappy and brilliant.Unklike most shows, all the characters are fairly similar. There isn't a smart character, an evil character, a nerd, a dumb character...they're all a little on the dumb side, and they're all evil. If you watched Taxi, it's like every character is Louie DiPalma, but worse. They have no regard for anyone outside their circle, and not that much regard for one another. Turns out you don't have to have wildly different characters to make great comedy.Just to give you an example of how crude this show can be...in one episode Frank (Danny Devito) shows up at the funeral of the husband of his sister-in-law..so he can bang her, to get back at his wife, who also has recently died. The sister-in-law turns Frank down, so he starts messing around with her daughter, which would technically be his niece. Some of the characters sniff glue. Dennis (Glenn Howerton) anonymously calls women he's dating, disguising his voice, threatening them with physical violence...so he can later swoop in as their protector of his made-up stalker.
