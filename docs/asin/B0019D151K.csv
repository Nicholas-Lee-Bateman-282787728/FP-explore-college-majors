But I know that eventually this show loses its shine from the newer episodes I catch every now and then on TV.  I can see it starting in this Season 4.  Instead of clever, witty banter between the characters, the dialogue is starting to come across as more mean-spirited than fun.  Plus, as the kid grows up, he's not as believable as an innocent, which in turn doesn't make him as funny on the show.  Still worth buying, and I'll buy the 5th season, too, but that might be the last one I buy.  I'll see.

For most guys add great deal of being shallow and there you go. Men. I don't see this show as a statement about women, but one of how stupid guys can be when it comes to life and the le femme. When it comes to women, let's face it we are idiots.

Season after season the show has gotten better and better. I dont think that this season, shorted by the writer's strike , did they reach the comedy heights of previous seasons..but the humor is one of the best sexual farces TV has to offer.The One reason I love this show on DVD is it is like watching a great one act play. This may seem like a sitcom but it tramples boundaries of great farces. It can grab you and reel you into laughter in moments.The supporting cast is just as sharp as Sheen and Cryer. Agnus Jones plays Alan's son Jake, who is smarter than his uncle Charlie. Conchata Ferrell as the housekeeper Berta wisecracks her way into your heart. Melanie Lynskey is Charlie's stalker and neighbor Rose. Holland Taylor steals every scene she is in as Charlie and Alan's mother.This show is not for kids. I still wonder why the reruns are on at 7p when kids are around.

1162943,AEJAGHLC675A7,B0019D151K,John Williamson,"[17, 19]","It's good to see thatTwo and a Half Men - The Complete Fourth Seasonis coming out on DVD, for (in my personal opinion) it's the best and funniest sitcom series of this decade. As a single father, this viewer can find much to relate to... and laugh about.For those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing this top-rated series on TV, it's about the lives of two brothers, one of the brother's son, and the many people, especially women, who surround them. When his wimpy younger brother Alan Harper (Jon Crier) becomes separated from his wife and moves out of their house, he has to move in with Charlie, his older brother (played by Charlie Sheen). Alan shares custody of his son Jake (Angus T. Jones), who was 10 when the series began and who stays with them part-time. The ""half a man"" in the title of this sitcom is in reference to the fact that Jake isn't an adult yet.Charlie Harper is a successful bachelor with a house on Malibu Beach, a Mercedes in the garage and an easy way with women. His easygoing, often hedonistic single lifestyle is interrupted when his tightly-wound brother, Alan (a chiropractor), and Alan's son, Jake , move in with him. Alan's hung-up ex-wife Judith (Marin Hinkle) frequently makes matters worse, as does the brothers' narcissistic mother, Evelyn (Holland Taylor), whose wide-ranging sex life is a recurring gag throughout the series. The brothers' housekeeper Berta (Conchata Ferrell) is unapologetically sarcastic, and often has the best one-liners, trading insults with Charlie referring to Alan as ""Zippy."" Their household can't function without her.There are a number of other series regulars, but in this viewer's opinion, Charlie's wacky neighbor and female stalker Rose (Melanie Lynskey) is one of the best. She has a habit of popping over Charlie's deck railing and sometimes enter his house at inopportune moments. It's alluded that she had a one night stand with Charlie shortly before the show started, which she believed to be more significant than he did. Rose's father Harvey is played by Martin Sheen, and in one episode he asks Charlie of his intentions with his daughter. At one point Harvey meets Charlie and Alan's mother and has an affair with her, and popping in and stalking her just like his daughter does with Charlie.It should be said that this series and its actors have won a number of Emmy Awards and nominations. Those who are familiar with it can well understand why. This series is well worth it, and if you do like it, there are other seasons available:-Two and a Half Men - The Complete First Season-Two and a Half Men - The Complete Second Season-Two and a Half Men - The Complete Third SeasonAnd notice that they are all rated at 4+ stars by the reviewers here... my call is that they're all 5-stars.
