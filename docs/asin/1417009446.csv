172073,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1417009446,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 6]","Typically whenever I see an American remake of anything that British hands have touched, I cringe.  I don't just cringe, I yell, followed by a yelp, and then I begin to spasm.  It isn't a pretty sight, so after viewing the BBC masterpiece ""The Office"" with David Brent helming the office that anyone that has ever worked for the corporate world has endured time and time again, I was extremely nervous about this American version that was going to invade our weekly lineup.  Could any cast successfully do what Gervais so originally did?  Would/Could it translate to non-intelligent American viewers?  My thought was no, but thankfully Gervais stuck with it, brought aboard the amazingly gifted Carell to lead this eerily real office into the American living room.  Within the first several episodes of the sporadic first season, I was hooked, but it was this second season that transformed me into a true fan.Michael Scott, a name now synonymous with images of any office boss, is the head of Dunder Mifflin's Scranton office, whose passion is for humor and friendship, not necessarily the best interest of the office.  What makes Scott the quintessential boss is that he is decent at his job, but is only there due to the elusive ""grandfather"" clause, demonstrated in any corporate environment when the least qualified gets the job due mainly in part to his dedication to the company - not necessarily their quality of workmanship.  Scott is not the smartest in the office, and the hijinks ensue due to the fact that those coworkers around him are not afraid to exploit the opportunity at any given moment.  In fact, what makes this show work is not just Carell's character, but those surrounding him on a daily basis.  The one weakness that the BBC ""Office"" had trouble with is exactly what makes this program stand out.  The BBC version focused directly on Brent, and not quite taking him out of his office element or allowing us to see what laid behind those unreinforced walls.  In the series by NBC, we have such a humanistic view of the office.  There are those that we care about, there are those that we laugh at, there are those we feel sympathy towards, and there are those that we just simply relate to.  It was the drama of the office this second season that transformed me into a fan.  The relationship between Dwight and Jim, thus the relationship between Jim and Pam, as well as the spawning diabolical relationship between the Temp and Kelly (of which I am constantly laughing).I don't want to go so far as to say that I am a ""fanboy"" of this series, honestly, I still like the BBC the best, but this American version continues to make me laugh after several viewings.  The characters are so strong, detailed, and each individually their own person.  That is odd to hear, but I believe one could create a whole series around each character and still have a great program.  Obviously, Dwight Schrute has become a stand out character, but it is because of the genuinely strong writing style, the Christopher Guest style of mockumentary, and the ""edge-of-your-couch"" nervousness that each episode brings that each character is allowed to shine.  I like the layout of the series as well.  There are genuine heart-felt moments being uprooted between Scott and his ""ladies"", Jim and Pam, as well as the inner office connection between Schrute and ___________ (insert your guess here).  As audience members, we get more from this series than we did with the short-lived three season BBC version.  I know these characters better, I laugh at the absurdities mainly because I have experienced the same in Corporate America.  I laugh because it's true.Personal favorite episodes from the season:""Bring your Daughter to Work Day""""Casino Night""""Boys and Girls""""Drug Testing""""The Injury"" (can I look at a George Foreman the same?)Overall, I have to suggest this series to everyone out there.  I am not going to drool over the box because with each season the creators of this show walk a fine line.  They could utterly destroy the foundation by elongating the series too much or by forgetting the BBC roots OR even get caught up in the hype surrounding the characters - but for now, I am happy.  Gervais hasn't sold out in my eyes, he has brought a crisp, original, intelligent new program for the American audiences, and it surprises me that we have grasped it openly.  Now, if we could only get more people to watch and enjoy ""Curb your Enthusiasm"", the war would be ours!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Otherwise it's just malfeasance for malfeasance's sake.,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,4503,"['Typically', 'whenever', 'see', 'American', 'remake', 'anything', 'British', 'hands', 'have', 'touched', 'cringe', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'cringe', 'yell', 'followed', 'yelp', 'then', 'begin', 'spasm', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'sight', 'so', 'viewing', 'BBC', 'masterpiece', 'Office', 'David', 'Brent', 'helming', 'office', 'anyone', 'ever', 'worked', 'corporate', 'world', 'endured', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'was', 'extremely', 'nervous', 'American', 'version', 'was', 'going', 'invade', 'weekly', 'lineup', 'Could', 'cast', 'successfully', 'do', 'what', 'Gervais', 'so', 'originally', 'did', 'Would/Could', 'translate', 'non-intelligent', 'American', 'viewers', 'thought', 'was', 'thankfully', 'Gervais', 'stuck', 'brought', 'amazingly', 'gifted', 'Carell', 'lead', 'eerily', 'real', 'office', 'American', 'living', 'room', 'first', 'several', 'episodes', 'sporadic', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'hooked', 'was', 'second', 'season', 'transformed', 'true', 'fan.Michael', 'Scott', 'name', 'now', 'synonymous', 'images', 'office', 'boss', 'head', 'Dunder', 'Mifflin', 'Scranton', 'office', 'passion', 'humor', 'friendship', 'not', 'necessarily', 'best', 'interest', 'office', 'What', 'Scott', 'quintessential', 'boss', 'decent', 'job', 'only', 'there', 'due', 'elusive', 'grandfather', 'clause', 'demonstrated', 'corporate', 'environment', 'when', 'least', 'qualified', 'job', 'due', 'mainly', 'part', 'dedication', 'company', 'not', 'necessarily', 'quality', 'workmanship', 'Scott', 'not', 'smartest', 'office', 'hijinks', 'ensue', 'due', 'fact', 'coworkers', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'exploit', 'opportunity', 'given', 'moment', 'fact', 'what', 'show', 'work', 'not', 'just', 'Carell', 'character', 'surrounding', 'daily', 'basis', 'one', 'weakness', 'BBC', 'Office', 'had', 'trouble', 'exactly', 'what', 'program', 'stand', 'BBC', 'version', 'focused', 'directly', 'Brent', 'not', 'quite', 'taking', 'office', 'element', 'allowing', 'see', 'what', 'laid', 'unreinforced', 'walls', 'series', 'NBC', 'have', 'such', 'humanistic', 'view', 'office', 'are', 'care', 'are', 'laugh', 'are', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'are', 'just', 'simply', 'relate', 'was', 'drama', 'office', 'second', 'season', 'transformed', 'fan', 'relationship', 'Dwight', 'Jim', 'thus', 'relationship', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'as', 'well', 'spawning', 'diabolical', 'relationship', 'Temp', 'Kelly', 'am', 'constantly', 'laughing', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'am', 'fanboy', 'series', 'honestly', 'still', 'BBC', 'best', 'American', 'version', 'make', 'several', 'viewings', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'detailed', 'individually', 'own', 'person', 'odd', 'hear', 'believe', 'one', 'could', 'create', 'whole', 'series', 'character', 'still', 'have', 'great', 'program', 'Obviously', 'Dwight', 'Schrute', 'become', 'stand', 'out', 'character', 'genuinely', 'strong', 'writing', 'style', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'style', 'mockumentary', 'edge-of-your-couch', 'nervousness', 'episode', 'character', 'allowed', 'shine', 'layout', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'genuine', 'heart-felt', 'moments', 'being', 'uprooted', 'Scott', 'ladies', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'as', 'well', 'inner', 'office', 'connection', 'Schrute', '___________', 'insert', 'guess', 'here', 'audience', 'members', 'get', 'more', 'series', 'did', 'short-lived', 'three', 'season', 'BBC', 'version', 'know', 'characters', 'better', 'laugh', 'absurdities', 'mainly', 'have', 'experienced', 'same', 'Corporate', 'America', 'laugh', 'true.Personal', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'Bring', 'Daughter', 'Work', 'Day', 'Casino', 'Night', 'Boys', 'Girls', 'Drug', 'Testing', 'Injury', 'can', 'look', 'George', 'Foreman', 'same', 'Overall', 'have', 'suggest', 'series', 'everyone', 'there', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'drool', 'box', 'season', 'creators', 'show', 'fine', 'line', 'could', 'utterly', 'destroy', 'foundation', 'elongating', 'series', 'too', 'much', 'forgetting', 'BBC', 'roots', 'OR', 'even', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'now', 'am', 'happy', 'Gervais', ""n't"", 'sold', 'out', 'eyes', 'brought', 'crisp', 'original', 'intelligent', 'new', 'program', 'American', 'audiences', 'have', 'grasped', 'openly', 'Now', 'could', 'only', 'get', 'more', 'people', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'war', 'would', 'be', 'ours', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

172076,A3U2REB8VQ6RHY,1417009446,"Amy Tiemann ""aka Mojo Mom""","[123, 131]","For new potential fans of ""The Office,"" the DVD set of the break-out second season is a must-see.  Start recording the third season now (premieres Sept. 21) and save those episodes, but don't watch them until you've watched the complete second season.For devotees like myself, the DVD set is a just reward for loyal viewing.  The show came into its own this year.  I had watched fitfully until the stretch of episodes starting with ""The Injury,"" ""The Secret,"" and ""The Carpet"" hooked me for good.  I am now going back to watch the whole season again and the shows hold up very well upon repeated viewing.Strengths of the season:  Steve Carell gets the award for Most Improved Characterization.  It took about a dozen episodes (starting with 6 in the first season) for the show to settle on a tone for Carell's incompetent boss.  For a while I wasn't sure what to make of him, which kept me from getting attached to the show.  But this season he evolved from a mean jerk to a clueless, lonely man who really just wants everybody to be his friend.  While the Michael Scott character still has plenty of totally inappropriate behavior and tons of cringe-worthy moments, his core of pathos and vulnerability humanizes him.  I am even rooting for him to find love with Carol or Jan.  As we saw this season, the fumbling results will surely be funny.Now that Carell provides a solid anchor for the cast, the rest of the supporting actors can truly come into their own.  From Rainn Wilson's complete dedication to the serious idiocy of office suck-up Dwight Schrute, to the smaller roles of wild-card Creed and eternally suffering temp Ryan, the ensemble has truly gelled.And of course the slow-motion unfolding of Jim & Pam's romance provided the heart of the show throughout the season.  Just about anyone over the age of 30 has been either Jim, Pam, or Roy at sometime in their life, and the bittersweet agony of the whole journey provided the summer's biggest cliffhanger.  In my online poll to find the ""Top Mom Crushes,"" both John Krasinski and Steve Carell have been nominated.Finally, the DVD extras are truly great.  The deleted scenes for each episode range from about 4 to 11 minutes and they are really funny.  The discipline of 22 minutes works in the show's favor keep the stories tight, but the extra scenes are a worthy bonus for true fans.This is a fantastic show, and a great DVD set.  Even if you didn't watch the British version of the show (which I could never quite get into) give the American version of ""The Office"" a chance.  What separates ""The Office"" from any other current ""sitcom"" is that much of the humor comes from what is left unsaid, rather than having a barrage of lame one-liners hitting viewers over the head.

Then Season Two came along and became the best comedy on television, a series completely independent of its overseas sibling, and a show I cannot miss a single episode of.The strength of this show -- the adventures of the staff of Dunder-Mifflin paper company, Scranton, Pa. branch -- lies entirely in the brilliance of the characters and the talent of the actors in the parts.

You know these characters, and while the comedy sometimes gets absurd, it never gets unrealistic. Towards the end of the season, you're aching so badly for Jim to get together with Pam that the cliffhanger finale will have you screaming for NBC to rush the Season Three set.In addition to all of the episodes from Season 2, the DVD set includes some nice extras, including commentaries, the Olympic promos from last February, the Fake PSAs that aired around April Fool's Day and the 10 ""webisodes"" that were parceled out a week at a time on NBC.com over the summer.

172083,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,1417009446,Bookphile,"[4, 4]","it did--and in a big way.I loved the first season for its biting, realistic humor but I'm even happier to say that the show seems to have really hit its stride in its second season.  There were so many great, laugh-out-loud funny episodes that I could discuss the show for hours and hours.  Every episode in this season was topical in a way that will be familiar to anyone who works in or has ever worked in an office--everything from e-mail monitoring to sensitive treatment of people with disabilities to the crazy and silly games people play when their boss is out of the office is covered with dead on accuracy.  And, of course, the Jim and Pam potential romance is definitely not to be missed, especially considering the juicy way in which everything is left off in the end.One of the things that constantly amazes me about this show is the diversity of Steve Carell.  He is such a highly offensive jerk that at times I want to reach through the screen and strangle him.  Yet at other times he is so pathetic that I can't help but feel sorry for him.  Case in point would be ""The Dundies"" in which Pam comes to his rescue after he is ruthlessly mocked by Chili's diners and ""Take Your Daughter to Work Day"" in which we see a truly pathetic clip of Michael's brief stint as a childhood actor.  Carell somehow manages to be simultaneously outrageously crass and downright cruel and yet, on occasion, so pathetic he is also lovable--as Jan Levinson finds out.And how about Jim?  He is such a great character, the kind of guy it's easy to imagine both women and men liking equally.  He's so funny and his jests come across as the sort of realistic, off-the-cuff one liners your office clown might spew off.  He is also sensitive and pitiable as he continues to pine over Pam who is strangely blind to his great advantages over her oafish jerk of a fianc&eacute;.  Pam is also an engaging character as a woman who is trapped in a relationship about which she is really not quite certain and who is afraid to take any sort of big, life-changing steps because, well, they're big and life-changing.Last but certainly not least is the truly quirky and strange Dwight.  His office romance adds a whole ick and hilarity factor to the second season.

172089,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,1417009446,"Cloud ""...""","[6, 6]","I have to be honest: many shows people consider ""the funniest show on TV"" I just don't find funny at all. Friends after awhile just got stale and I never got the appeal of Everybody Loves Raymond. The Office came around since I was looking to get into a new show and you hear so much about it, you just kind of figure you'd check into it. Even starting the show on the 2nd season still made it accessible and there's plenty to like about the show. From the writing to the comedy to the moments of drama, it's great to see a show that rarely has an outright bomb.The show centers on the workers/drones who work at Dunder-Mifflin, a paper sales company. The manager is Michael Scott, a rude and inconsiderate boss who has so much ignorance that he's unaware of the fact nobody seems to find him funny or a competent boss. His assistant is Dwight Schrute, an incredible oddball who is a suck-up, nerd and genuine weirdo all in one. Then we have cutie receptionist Pam, relatable everyman Jim, cold Angela and many others as they deal with the boredom and weirdness that can happen in the office.Of course, what makes the show work so well, besides the comedy, is the realism. Shot documentary-style, the show tends to accurately portray the different types of characters you're bound to run into (although I am glad to say I never met a real-life Dwight). I even have my own version of Pam, the girl you're just obviously meant to be with but circumstances prevents you from stepping in. Another big plus is the cast never seems to have a useless character and they end up contributing something to the place, even if they're boring and humorless (Toby) shrill and annoying (Kelly), the office just would seem to bland had they not been around.It's hard to gauge how the show would work if you already watched the episodes but rarely do you get complete misfires. While there's some highlights including practically any prank Jim pulls on Dwight or the Christmas Party episode or the heartbreak Michael gets during ""Bring Your Daughter to Work Day"", each episode feels a part of a whole rather than having it be hit-and-miss throughout the season. Of course, the big arc is the Jim and Pam romance, or rather the lack thereof since you rarely see a more perfect couple on TV and yet they're not together since she's engaged to the insensitive Roy (who oddly has a real-life counterpart to my very own Pam as well). There's some biggies in the season including a doozy I'm not spoiling.With commentaries, bloopers, and many other extras, not only is it a hilarious and even a touching season but it's got plenty of extras to check out afterwards. I'd very much recommend this show if you're not watching it already. Oh and just because people say the British version is better is not reason enough to completely ignore this.",5,"Might seem like exaggerated praise,,,",1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,2820,"['have', 'be', 'honest', 'many', 'shows', 'people', 'consider', 'funniest', 'show', 'TV', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'Friends', 'awhile', 'just', 'got', 'stale', 'never', 'got', 'appeal', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Office', 'came', 'was', 'looking', 'get', 'new', 'show', 'hear', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'kind', 'figure', ""'d"", 'check', 'Even', 'starting', 'show', '2nd', 'season', 'still', 'made', 'accessible', 'plenty', 'like', 'show', 'writing', 'comedy', 'moments', 'drama', 'great', 'see', 'show', 'rarely', 'outright', 'bomb.The', 'show', 'centers', 'workers/drones', 'who', 'work', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'paper', 'sales', 'company', 'manager', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'rude', 'inconsiderate', 'boss', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'ignorance', 'unaware', 'fact', 'nobody', 'find', 'funny', 'competent', 'boss', 'assistant', 'Dwight', 'Schrute', 'incredible', 'oddball', 'who', 'suck-up', 'nerd', 'genuine', 'weirdo', 'one', 'Then', 'have', 'cutie', 'receptionist', 'Pam', 'relatable', 'everyman', 'Jim', 'cold', 'Angela', 'many', 'others', 'deal', 'boredom', 'weirdness', 'can', 'happen', 'office.Of', 'course', 'what', 'show', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'comedy', 'realism', 'Shot', 'documentary-style', 'show', 'accurately', 'portray', 'different', 'types', 'characters', ""'re"", 'bound', 'run', 'am', 'glad', 'say', 'never', 'met', 'real-life', 'Dwight', 'even', 'have', 'own', 'version', 'Pam', 'girl', ""'re"", 'just', 'obviously', 'meant', 'be', 'circumstances', 'prevents', 'stepping', 'big', 'plus', 'cast', 'never', 'have', 'useless', 'character', 'end', 'up', 'contributing', 'something', 'place', 'even', ""'re"", 'boring', 'humorless', 'Toby', 'shrill', 'annoying', 'Kelly', 'office', 'just', 'would', 'seem', 'bland', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'around.It', 'hard', 'gauge', 'how', 'show', 'would', 'work', 'already', 'watched', 'episodes', 'rarely', 'do', 'get', 'complete', 'misfires', 'highlights', 'including', 'practically', 'prank', 'Jim', 'Dwight', 'Christmas', 'Party', 'episode', 'heartbreak', 'Michael', 'Bring', 'Daughter', 'Work', 'Day', 'episode', 'part', 'whole', 'rather', 'having', 'be', 'hit-and-miss', 'season', 'course', 'big', 'arc', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'romance', 'rather', 'lack', 'thereof', 'rarely', 'see', 'more', 'perfect', 'couple', 'TV', 'yet', ""'re"", 'not', 'together', 'engaged', 'insensitive', 'Roy', 'who', 'oddly', 'real-life', 'counterpart', 'very', 'own', 'Pam', 'well', 'biggies', 'season', 'including', 'doozy', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling.With', 'commentaries', 'bloopers', 'many', 'other', 'extras', 'not', 'only', 'hilarious', 'even', 'touching', 'season', 'got', 'plenty', 'extras', 'check', 'out', 'afterwards', ""'d"", 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'show', ""'re"", 'not', 'watching', 'already', 'Oh', 'just', 'people', 'say', 'British', 'version', 'better', 'not', 'reason', 'enough', 'completely', 'ignore']",N/A

I too saw the entire British run of The Office (and was a huge fan) before the American version premiered.  The American version started as a fairly dull copy of the British series; however, before long it was apparent that the actors were wonderfully cast, that the writing was coming into its own, and that this Office was just as good as the original (albeit in a slightly different way).  I feel it is inaccurate to say that the American version has somehow gone for cheap laughs or has been cloying in any manner; in fact, they could have gone with a laugh track, but they did NOT.  They could have ditched the documentary format (for fear that American audiences would not ""get"" it) but they did NOT.  There is no doubt that the original and the American versions are two different animals, but they are both brilliant, both hilarious, and both worthy of our time.  I do think that Gervais's David Brent was a little more nuanced and dry than Steve Carrell's Michael Scott.  On the other hand, Rainn Wilson's Dwight is the best character on EITHER show.

To their credit, NBC has made a show which has a life of its own and this is hands down the best program on network TV today.The writers and cast has managed to build upon Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant and the BBC crew had created in the original - a hillarious documentary about working in a place where people just try to get by under the most mundane circumstances.  What's so great about this show is that the episodes reflect the modern work environment.The DVD contains some great bonus features which are additional episodes in themselves.  One feature shows the story of the ""Accountants"" which I thought was a hillarious ""whodunnit"" bit.  The DVDs also contain those fake PSA commercials played by the actors from the show discussing the unusual topics of directions for weddings, cakes, bears, etc.If you are a fan of the show, you will get a kick of all the extra features on this DVD.

This four-DVD set contains all 22 episodes of Season Two of the American version of the series that appeared on NBC from September 2005 to May 2006.The show is shot in documentary form and looks at life at the Scranton branch of the Dunder-Mifflin paper company, where Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is the manager.  Michael is the American version of David Brent--he is smarmy, dishonest, and obnoxious, and makes life difficult for those under him.

There's inept regional manager Michael Scott (Steve Carrell)  is anxious -- as always -- to look competent. We meet his employees -- overeager salesman Dwight (Rainn Wilson), whose main missions in life includes kissing up to Michael; and his deskmate Jim (John Krasinski), who does his best to get by with a minimal amount of effort while on the job. There's also Toby, the quiet, long-suffering HR rep; prim and proper Angela; patient Oscar; long-term temp Ryan; the often childlike Kevin; Meredith, who's a little open about her fondness for men and booze; Creed, whose past as a musician with the Grass Roots (the actor's real backstory) is a tad questionable; talkative Kelly; and Pam (Jenna Fischer), the quiet, artistic receptionist who often holds the entire office together.In this season, we -- and the rest of the office -- clearly see the developing closeness between Jim and Pam, although the two do their best to deny it and Pam insists on proceeding with wedding plans with her long-time boyfriend, Dunder Mifflin warehouse employee Roy. We also see more layers to the blunderingly inappropriate Michael; despite the things he does, it's becoming evident that beneath it all, he just wants everyone to like him.Particular noteworthy Season 2 episodes include ""The Dundies,"" an annual office ""award night"" dreaded by one and all. This year, an obviously tipsy Pam manages to set gears in motion by kissing Jim -- an act which is revisited throughout the season in various episodes, such as ""Booze Cruise"" and the season ender ""Casino Night."" It's then that Pam must decide once and for all if she truly wants to live her life with Roy, or risk everything familiar and comfortable for something beyond it that could be even better.As with all the other seasons of ""The Office,"" this box set includes lots of deleted scenes for every episode, as well as other features.

And, to make matters worse, because I'm extremely impatient with commercial interruptions, I hadn't seen these episodes during their original television airing, either.  But, better late that never, right?In case I'm not being clear, these episodes are great.  They're all kinds of funny: silly funny (Dwight); subtle funny (Dwight's colleagues); and absolutely train-wreck funny (Michael).  But, you know what?  The show is also emotionally complicated and surprisingly moving at times.  The Jim/Pam dynamic is probably the best example of an aspect of the show where these more sophisticated dynamics come into play, but some of the personal issues Michael goes through also display the layered subtlety that Steve Carell and the show's writers have carefully added to Michael's character during the progression of these episodes. Happily, of course, Michael is still never far from making an outrageous, totally inappropriate comment to his charges, and viewers are all the better for it.The season closer, ""Casino Night"", is an example in miniature of everything that makes this series a winner: it's got big laughs (Michael's usual cluelessness), subtle laughs (one character is revealed to be a closet klepto and starts stealing everything in sight), and true poignancy (the Jim/Pam stuff, but also some interesting Michael/Jan revelations).One final word about the characterizations, because they're really what make the show tick.  Every character (with the exception of Dwight, who's just there for laughs, and that's okay) is genuinely complicated.  For example, Jim and Pam are whip-smart about human nature, but both are afraid to take steps to improve their personal situations even though what they need to do is right in front of their faces.  And even Michael, the show's central clueless buffoon, is allowed moments of insight, and in his own strange way has a certain business acumen (watch how he saves a huge account during a business meeting at the local Chili's restaurant, a regular haunt on the show).Generous bonus features (commentaries, bloopers, deleted scenes, short ""webisodes"" that originally aired on the internet, and many other goodies) provide additional value to ""The Office, Season 2"".

Playing Dunder-Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott, Carell is a pure genius. Michael's seemingly complete lack of common sense comes through again and again as he deals with his group of paper company employees. And while Michael is clueless at times, in this season it becomes quite obvious that he was (and still is) a good salesman and is truly just a lonely guy looking to make friends and fit in somewhere in the world. In season two Michael ""accidently"" explores a relationship with his boss, Jan Levinson (recurring star Melora Hardin), purchases a condo and actually begins dating his realtor Carol, played by Carell's real life wife, Nancy Walls. He is also faced with the task of firing someone, tries to get everyone's spirits up at the Dunder Mifflin Awards (The Dundies) and on a motivational booze cruise.While Carell carries the cast, it is the supporting cast of characters that make the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin what it is. Rainn Wilson is a delight as Michael's loyal lieutenant Dwight Shrute. He has complete faith in Michael and does whatever crazy task his boss asks him to do. Dwight is particularly hilarious in an episode where he dons his volunteer sheriff uniform and tries to figure out who left half a joint in the parking lot. His secret relationship with uptight accountant Angela (recurring star Angela Kinsey) is also quite funny to watch.BJ Novak, who is also one of the writers on the show, is a temp in the office and often finds himself assigned to do personal errands for Michael. As Ryan Howard, it almost seems like Novak knows the suffering atmosphere that an office provides and he does a good job of portraying that. His ""relationship"" with co-worker Kelly (recurring star and writer Mindy Kaling) is also a laugh, as she seems stuck to him and he can't get out of the relationship no matter how much he may want to.But, stealing the show in season two were Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesley (Jenna Fisher). Jim is a salesman and Pam is the receptionist. They have a very close friendship and often team up to screw with Dwight. One of my favorites was when they convinced him that it was Friday when it was actually Thursday and he didn't show up on Friday morning. Jim and Pam's chemistry is obvious and viewers know through the interviews with Jim that he has feelings for Pam. Of course he can't act on them because she is engaged to warehouse worker Roy (recurring star David Denman) and they are set to be married. The will they or won't they vibe carried through the whole season and though I won't spoil the season finale, the final scene made for a great cliffhanger over the summer, one that is still being worked out as season three has gotten under way.Filling out the Dunder Mifflin office are a number of recurring stars: Leslie David Baker (the no-nonsense Stanley), Brian Baumgartner (accountant and wanna-be rock star Kevin), Oscar Nunez (in the closet accountant Oscar), Creed Bratton (the kleptomaniac salesman Creed), Paul Lieberstein (Human Resource's Toby, often the brunt of abuse from Michael), Phyllis Smith (quiet saleswoman Phyllis) and Kate Flannery (the office drunk, Meredith). David Koechner does a funny turn as a salesman, and Hardin does a great job as Jan. She really gets the chance to shine in a number of episodes during this season.And while the 22 great episodes would be reason enough to buy this set, there is much more to it than that. There are a number of great commentaries from cast members and crew. There are a number of deleted scenes for every single episode, as well as a nice gag reel. There are Olympic Promos featuring the staff and also the fake PSA's that the actors did for NBC. There is also a 10-webisode series called The Accountants, featuring Angela, Oscar and Kevin. Steve Carell does an interview with himself promoting the movie 40-Year-Old Virgin as well.All told, this is a great show, with great extras and a well-done set. Additionally, it makes you feel like maybe your job really isn't all that bad.",5,And the Dundie for top DVD...,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,4786,"['anyone', 'who', 'sat', 'office', '40', 'hours', 'week', 'working', 'incompetent', 'boss', 'atmosphere', 'suck', 'life', 'everyone', 'everything', 'Office', 'you.And', 'then', 'again', 'even', 'are', 'one', 'lucky', 'people', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'above', 'will', 'still', 'probably', 'crazy', 'phenomenal', 'season', 'comedic', 'television.Based', 'British', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'American', 'version', 'Office', 'truly', 'made', 'name', 'second', 'season', 'stories', 'characters', 'branched', 'British', 'version', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'here', 'fantastic', 'show', 'took', 'life', 'own.The', 'root', 'success', 'can', 'surely', 'be', 'traced', 'fantastic', 'job', 'done', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Playing', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'regional', 'manager', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Carell', 'pure', 'genius', 'Michael', 'seemingly', 'complete', 'lack', 'common', 'sense', 'again', 'again', 'group', 'paper', 'company', 'employees', 'Michael', 'clueless', 'times', 'season', 'quite', 'obvious', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'salesman', 'truly', 'just', 'lonely', 'guy', 'looking', 'make', 'friends', 'fit', 'somewhere', 'world', 'season', 'two', 'Michael', 'accidently', 'relationship', 'boss', 'Jan', 'Levinson', 'recurring', 'star', 'Melora', 'Hardin', 'purchases', 'condo', 'actually', 'dating', 'realtor', 'Carol', 'played', 'Carell', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'Walls', 'also', 'faced', 'task', 'firing', 'someone', 'tries', 'get', 'everyone', 'spirits', 'up', 'Dunder', 'Mifflin', 'Awards', 'Dundies', 'motivational', 'booze', 'cruise.While', 'Carell', 'cast', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'make', 'Scranton', 'branch', 'Dunder', 'Mifflin', 'what', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'delight', 'Michael', 'loyal', 'lieutenant', 'Dwight', 'Shrute', 'complete', 'faith', 'Michael', 'crazy', 'task', 'boss', 'do', 'Dwight', 'particularly', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'where', 'volunteer', 'sheriff', 'uniform', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'left', 'joint', 'parking', 'lot', 'secret', 'relationship', 'uptight', 'accountant', 'Angela', 'recurring', 'star', 'Angela', 'Kinsey', 'also', 'quite', 'funny', 'watch.BJ', 'Novak', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'writers', 'show', 'temp', 'office', 'often', 'assigned', 'do', 'personal', 'errands', 'Michael', 'Ryan', 'Howard', 'almost', 'Novak', 'suffering', 'atmosphere', 'office', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'relationship', 'co-worker', 'Kelly', 'recurring', 'star', 'writer', 'Mindy', 'Kaling', 'also', 'laugh', 'stuck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'relationship', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'may', 'want', 'to.But', 'stealing', 'show', 'season', 'two', 'were', 'Jim', 'Halpert', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Pam', 'Beesley', 'Jenna', 'Fisher', 'Jim', 'salesman', 'Pam', 'receptionist', 'have', 'very', 'close', 'friendship', 'often', 'up', 'screw', 'Dwight', 'One', 'favorites', 'was', 'when', 'convinced', 'was', 'Friday', 'when', 'was', 'actually', 'Thursday', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'Friday', 'morning', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'chemistry', 'obvious', 'viewers', 'know', 'interviews', 'Jim', 'feelings', 'Pam', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'engaged', 'warehouse', 'worker', 'Roy', 'recurring', 'star', 'David', 'Denman', 'are', 'set', 'be', 'married', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'vibe', 'carried', 'whole', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'season', 'finale', 'final', 'scene', 'made', 'great', 'cliffhanger', 'summer', 'one', 'still', 'being', 'worked', 'out', 'season', 'three', 'gotten', 'way.Filling', 'out', 'Dunder', 'Mifflin', 'office', 'are', 'number', 'recurring', 'stars', 'Leslie', 'David', 'Baker', 'no-nonsense', 'Stanley', 'Brian', 'Baumgartner', 'accountant', 'wanna-be', 'rock', 'star', 'Kevin', 'Oscar', 'Nunez', 'closet', 'accountant', 'Oscar', 'Creed', 'Bratton', 'kleptomaniac', 'salesman', 'Creed', 'Paul', 'Lieberstein', 'Human', 'Resource', 'Toby', 'often', 'brunt', 'abuse', 'Michael', 'Phyllis', 'Smith', 'quiet', 'saleswoman', 'Phyllis', 'Kate', 'Flannery', 'office', 'drunk', 'Meredith', 'David', 'Koechner', 'funny', 'turn', 'salesman', 'Hardin', 'great', 'job', 'Jan.', 'really', 'chance', 'shine', 'number', 'episodes', 'season.And', '22', 'great', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'buy', 'set', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'number', 'great', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'members', 'crew', 'are', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'single', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'gag', 'reel', 'are', 'Olympic', 'Promos', 'featuring', 'staff', 'also', 'fake', 'PSA', 'actors', 'did', 'NBC', 'also', '10-webisode', 'series', 'called', 'Accountants', 'featuring', 'Angela', 'Oscar', 'Kevin', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'interview', 'promoting', 'movie', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'well.All', 'told', 'great', 'show', 'great', 'extras', 'well-done', 'set', 'Additionally', 'feel', 'maybe', 'job', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad']",N/A

172116,A2Y8YMZS7YNEA3,1417009446,Joyce Duhaine,"[0, 0]","There are a LOT of great written reviews for this show so there really isn't too much that I can add - While the first season was in a way unneccessary, it was still important to introduce the new cast, setting, and feel of the show. Season two is where The Office learns to stand on it's own two feet - and becomes perhaps the last great American sit-com.I don't know how many other people caught this but it wasn't long though before I found myself getting deja vu an awful lot and finally I realized that I was watching M*A*S*H again - Col. Henry Blake (Michael Scott) leads his men: Frank Burns (Dwight) who tries to keep his affair with fellow-fascist Hot Lips Houlihan (Angela) a secret, though everyone else at the 4077th (Dunder Mifflin Warehouse) knows and/or doesn't care - except for Hawkeye (Jim) who constantly plays pranks on Burns (Dwight) to combat boredom and/or get him to go insane. In THIS version however, Hawkeye's (Jim's) best friend Trapper John (Pam) is a woman, so the love they feel for each other isn't quite as platonic as what started out. A minor addition would be Ryan being the most Radar-like, but this is a pretty moot addition.The similarities certainly make the show work - but only on a bare-bones level because it's the dialogue and the STORIES that make the show work so well and make it a modern-day classic. I'm really surprised that I like The Office so much because I hate almost every TV show made in America these days - they're either mean-spirited, unimaginative, or just plain dumb. (""Dexter"" is the only other perfect show we've got as far as I'm concerned. If it wasn't for subbed-anime (thanks yet again to DVD!) or boxed sets of older TV shows, I'd have thrown my television set out the window like at the beginning of SCTV) So I was very happy to find myself falling in love with The Office after only a couple episodes into season two. The characters are VERY likeable - and even though they did steal directly from M*A*S*H in the episode where Angela tries to get ""her man"" Dwight to take over command of the office- just like Margaret Houlihan did for Frank Burns - that episode still worked and felt new. (This story may have been in season three - I watched them in a blur I was enjoying them so much - but if you've ever seen the first few seasons of M*A*S*H, you'll definitely see the connections between shows in this ep more than any other!)What makes the seasons worth buying is the fact that they can be rewatched many many times and still be fun. This is in part because of the pseudo-documentary way in which they're shot, sometimes it feels REAL and not scripted thanks in part to the superb acting, direction, and scripts. But the biggest reason they're worth buying is, of course, the deleted scenes. If all the deleted scenes were added to the episodes themselves, they'd range in length from 35 to 50 minutes long. I can't get over how good they are either, and it's a shame TV sitcoms went from 25 1/2 minutes long to 20 minutes long. That's why DVD's are so important and it's also why The Office sets are revolutionary. THIS is how it's supposed to be done.",5,M*A*S*H In An Office,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,3132,"['are', 'LOT', 'great', 'written', 'show', 'so', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'can', 'add', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'way', 'unneccessary', 'was', 'still', 'important', 'introduce', 'new', 'cast', 'setting', 'feel', 'show', 'Season', 'two', 'where', 'Office', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'perhaps', 'last', 'great', 'American', 'sit-com.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'caught', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'found', 'getting', 'deja', 'vu', 'awful', 'lot', 'finally', 'realized', 'was', 'watching', 'M*A*S*H', 'again', 'Col.', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'men', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'Dwight', 'who', 'keep', 'affair', 'fellow-fascist', 'Hot', 'Lips', 'Houlihan', 'Angela', 'secret', 'everyone', 'else', '4077th', 'Dunder', 'Mifflin', 'Warehouse', 'and/or', ""n't"", 'care', 'Hawkeye', 'Jim', 'who', 'constantly', 'pranks', 'Burns', 'Dwight', 'combat', 'boredom', 'and/or', 'get', 'go', 'insane', 'THIS', 'version', 'however', 'Hawkeye', 'Jim', 'best', 'friend', 'Trapper', 'John', 'Pam', 'woman', 'love', 'feel', 'other', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'platonic', 'what', 'started', 'out', 'minor', 'addition', 'would', 'be', 'Ryan', 'being', 'most', 'Radar-like', 'pretty', 'moot', 'addition.The', 'similarities', 'certainly', 'make', 'show', 'work', 'only', 'bare-bones', 'level', 'dialogue', 'STORIES', 'make', 'show', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'make', 'modern-day', 'classic', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'like', 'Office', 'so', 'much', 'hate', 'almost', 'TV', 'show', 'made', 'America', 'days', ""'re"", 'mean-spirited', 'unimaginative', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'Dexter', 'only', 'other', 'perfect', 'show', ""'ve"", 'got', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'was', ""n't"", 'subbed-anime', 'thanks', 'yet', 'again', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'sets', 'older', 'TV', 'shows', ""'d"", 'have', 'thrown', 'television', 'set', 'out', 'window', 'beginning', 'SCTV', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'find', 'falling', 'love', 'Office', 'only', 'couple', 'season', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'VERY', 'likeable', 'even', 'did', 'steal', 'directly', 'M*A*S*H', 'episode', 'where', 'Angela', 'get', 'man', 'Dwight', 'take', 'over', 'command', 'office-', 'just', 'Margaret', 'Houlihan', 'did', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'episode', 'still', 'worked', 'felt', 'new', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'season', 'three', 'watched', 'blur', 'was', 'enjoying', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'M*A*S*H', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'see', 'connections', 'shows', 'ep', 'more', 'other', 'What', 'seasons', 'worth', 'buying', 'fact', 'can', 'be', 'rewatched', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'be', 'fun', 'part', 'pseudo-documentary', 'way', ""'re"", 'shot', 'feels', 'REAL', 'not', 'scripted', 'thanks', 'part', 'superb', 'acting', 'direction', 'scripts', 'biggest', 'reason', ""'re"", 'worth', 'buying', 'course', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'added', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'range', 'length', '35', '50', 'minutes', 'long', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'good', 'are', 'shame', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'went', '25', '1/2', 'minutes', 'long', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'why', 'DVD', 'are', 'so', 'important', 'also', 'why', 'Office', 'sets', 'are', 'revolutionary', 'THIS', 'how', 'supposed', 'be', 'done']",N/A

You pick up more details the more times you watch: strange facial expressions and gestures, characters in the background, odd items on desks, etc.  Also, I appreciate the absence of an annoying laugh track. Awkward silences are far superior!Steve Carrell's character, Michael, is weirdly irritating, immature, and pathetic.  He's so desperate for everyone to be his friend that half the time you're annoyed with him - and yet you can't help loving him and feeling sorry for his lack of popularity and unique qualities. I thought it was sad when he found out about Jim's party (Email Surveillance episode), to which he was not invited. And it was almost painful to see how everyone hated him in the acting class; but he was obnoxious and repeated the same antics like a little kid, which would bother most people, I think. Nonetheless, he remains a likeable character.Uptight Angela is so funny as she tries to hide her relationship with Dwight, and vice versa.  I especially loved the Valentine's episode, and also the Casino Finale when Dwight kissed her on the cheek. She ""angrily"" slaps him, but as she walks away, you see a flicker of a smile before her regular stony expression returns.Kelly is the typical annoying, gossipy coworker that talks like a boy-crazy teenager and acts as if she's still in high school at times. For example, she asked Jim to ask Ryan if he Liked her.  And when Jan came to have a meeting with all female staff, I loved this remark by Kelly:""I don't want to be one of those soccer moms in a minivan,""  she begins, as Jan looks on approvingly.

This mockumentary presents the everyday goings-on at the Scranton branch of Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company Inc. The interactions that are captured among the employees are hilariously cringe-inducing as Regional Manager Michael Scott, wonderfully portrayed by Steve Carell, pines for EVERYONE'S adoration while attempting to incorporate political correctness and social consciousness into the workplace. One problem: he is clueless to the fact that he basks in ignorance and narrow-mindedness. Strangely enough, he is also warm-hearted and sensitive. See the ""Halloween"" episode where he struggles with the task of laying off an employee or the ""Take Your Daughter To Work Day"" episode where it's obvious that he's a natural with kids. The deleted scenes on the DVD set are so outstanding that the producers should have integrated them back into the episodes instead of tagging at the end. They are not to be neglected.All of the characters (from Corporate Executive Jan Levinson to the warehouse guys) are written and portrayed in multidimensional fashion so viewers are interested in the subplots and background interactions in each episode. It is this specific season that we witness further development of the relationships of Jim & Pam, Dwight & Angela, Ryan & Kelly, Michael & Jan, and Oscar & ??. What does the future hold? Who knows?

Damn, those TV networks for putting two such great shows up against each other.  But that's the way it usually goes, unfortunately.  Anyway, I'd caught an episode or two during ""The Office's"" first two seasons--and really enjoyed them.  So I began watching the DVDs and fell in love--with the hysterical laugh-out-loud writing and especially the wonderful and kooky characters that work in ""The Office"".  I don't know which one is my favorite--Angela with her pursed lips  and evil glare, Jim and Pam (whose close friendship is so well-acted by actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer), Ryan the temp whose relationship with the annoying, self-centered Kelly (who is a joy to watch despite her personality) is hilarious, the lovable Phyllis, the alcoholic single mother Meredith (who is a very sad character whom you just can't help but adore as played by the talented Kate Flannery), Michael and Jan (whose volatile relationship is a hoot), and--well, I could go on and on and list every last character but I'll stop here. You get the picture.  As for the DVD, the show really comes into its own during this second season as each and every character gets a chance to shine in at least one or more episodes.  It's truly an ensemble show--one of the best currently on television--and one of the only great sitcoms still remaining (at least in my opinion).  The DVD has too many terrific episodes to name them all, but a few of my favorites are ""Christmas Party"", ""Booze Cruise"", ""Drug Testing"" and ""Casino Night"".  There are a lot of great extras, including tons of deleted scenes from each episode, lots of funny, interesting commentaries, 10 webisodes starring the accounting staff of ""The Office"" and some bizarre Fake PSAs that parody NBC's ""The More You Know"" messages (I LOVED them).

The Series was original in its premise and execution, the pseudo-documentary format opening up numerous previously little explored avenues of storytelling. And it was great fun to watch.The setting (the office of a small branch of paper-selling company) and the stories (everyday life of the people found working in such a low-prospects jobs) seem mundane at first. And there lies the magic of the creators. For (if the endless strings of CSIs are any indication) it not hard to create good TV with car chases, gadgets and explosions. It is extremely hard to make excellent TV with only the everyday grind to work with. It seems effortless only because they made it look easy.The brief one-way interviews each character had with the camera functioned as either prefatory summaries of stories about to unfold (building up the anticipation) or as instances of pushing back, yet never breaking, the forth wall, and, thus, making the viewing experience more personal and involving. All without the show ever loosing its step.Producing, directing and writing will only get you so far without the right cast. And THE OFFICE enjoyed such stellar cast. Steve Carell may have risked getting typecast by creating the unforgettable character of Michael Scott but it was worth it. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) served first as the precarious love interest and then as the familiar friends you care about and the rest of the cast was one successful pick after another. From hypochondriac and hypercritical (not to mention hypocritical) Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to perky Kelly Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), I could not imagine anyone else portraying these memorable characters. However, the show stealer has always been obsessive nerd Dwight Schrute, portrayed to perfection by Rainn Wilson.Purists and snobs will try to argue thatthe precursor British Serieswas better. Strangely for someone who usually finds Hollywood remakes watered down and bland, in this case I strongly disagree. The US version was much better. It had the perfect mix of familiar workday desperation and sweet quirkiness to make it a weekly craved addiction. In contrast, I found the BBC version too mean for my taste. Maybe one should have grown up in a cruel class system carved out by accent hues and prep-school rankings to appreciate it; however, during the handful of  episodes I managed to watch I found myself laughing at the characters, not with them, and then felt bad about it. Anyway, in all honesty, how could Gareth ever compare to Dwight!The series is unique in another aspect as well: it respected its viewers. Every producer, director and writer wants to make his or hers memorable splash so we often end up with unnecessary cliffhangers, ambiguous endings or unsatisfying closures. Not so with THE OFFICE.

172146,A1XTWXIMUCDGQE,1417009446,Oddsfish,"[2, 3]","I was slow getting on board for The Office. I remember reading a creative writer, one time (can't remember who), saying that the most important element for writing a successful story was to have a likeable narrative voice. I think the reason it took me a while on this show was that the first season just didn't have that sort of voice. It was biting and harsh and a little dark. I didn't hate the show, but I certainly didn't like it enough to make the time to see new episodes.But then, a couple of years later, I saw part of one episode, `The Dundies,' where Pam was accepting her award, and she was so charming, and the tone was so different from the previous season (you seeing such compassion displayed toward Michael) that I was hooked. It's been such a rewarding show since then. Especially in Season 2, there's not a bad episode. Everything is so smartly written and so well acted. This sense of humor is new to American tv. And it's a meaningful show, too.My favorite thing about the show is how it's not conceived as just a bunch of single episodes. For most sitcoms, the season-long and multi-season-long story arches seem so episodic (no pun intended). There's always a big finale, but the plot wasn't developed such that the ending is logical, and the viewer is rarely emotionally prepared for whatever big even happens. I think this so hampers sitcoms, even good ones. They so rarely are conceived in a way that allows them to be anything beyond amusing.The Office, of course, is the opposite. The Pam and Jim storyline is realistic (I've been Jim before, I know) and heartfelt. The characterizations (what acting by both of them!) are of such depth (two sitcom characters who are actual adults!) that we can see this as a truthful situation and feel for them. And there are no hasty movements. The story arches have been orchestrated expertly, and the wonderful season finale, `Casino Night,' makes for a perfect climax.Of course, I love everything else, too. The childishness of Michael, the zaniness of Dwight, and the eccentricities of the other characters provide the perfect counterpoint for the more serious aspects of the show, and the show still succeeds as satire (as Season 1 wanted to be), albeit a less bitter one.Anyway, I can't think of a better season for any show.

172160,A16QODENBJVUI1,1417009446,Robert Moore,"[33, 35]","Warning:  Some spoilersOf all the half-hour comedy shows that I've ever seen, THE OFFICE is the one that I would have thought the least likely to be brilliant.  The BBC original version of the show was a thing of genius.  Trying to do an American version of it seemed to me to be akin to Andy Warhol doing a remake of Picasso's ""Guernica.""  Watching the show in Season One I was astonished that it was not only not bad, but that it was in fact very good.  Amazingly, in Season Two it became something utterly brilliant.  Although I was a huge fan of the original show, I have to confess that the American show is every bit as good as the British original.  It is the finest American adaptation of a British show since ALL IN THE FAMILY remade TIL DEATH DO US PART.Two things make this a great show:  the writing, which is persistently brilliant (though obviously aided by a great deal of improvisation on the set), and the cast, which is both talented and very deep.  Steve Carrell at first was not completely at home in the role, failing to strike the right balance between an utter absurdity and being likable nonetheless.  Ricky Gervais managed to get this perfect from the beginning and he was always someone viewers would find to be the world's biggest idiot while nonetheless inwardly rooting for things to work out for him.  At first, Carrell was incredibly funny in the role, but he was not someone to feel much sympathy for.  But as Season Two went on and some of his own insecurities were revealed, we came to understand that he was more aware of his own basic unlikability than his persistent bluster made clear.  By the end of the season he was near perfect in the role and he fully deserved the Golden Globe he won.  Nearly as many laughs were generated by his brown-nosing sycophant Dwight, played brilliantly by Rainn Wilson.  But the heart of the show in Season Two was the obvious and endearing attraction between Pam (sweetly played by Jenna Fischer), who is engaged to marry a guy who works in the warehouse, and Jim Halpert (winningly played by Jon Krasinski).  If the antics of Michael Scott dominated each individual episode, the non-romance between Jim and Pam dominated the season as a whole.  The climax of the entire season comes in the final episode, when Jim confesses his love for Pam and they kiss, just before he transfers to the Stamford, Connecticut branch of the company.  I have rarely seen so much anticipation over a summer for the start of a new season for a half-hour show as I did this one, with an army of fans of the show wondering how Pam and Jim would pick up in Season Three.Although THE OFFICE started off fine in its first season, it got better and better throughout Season Two.  Because it has already run for more episodes than the British original, it is beginning to exploit one advantage it has over it:  the ability to develop more fully minor characters.  In the second half of the season especially a number of characters who initially just took up space became known entities, such as Kelly, the Indian girl who is fixated on getting married and immediately having babies on the one hand and doing this with her coworker Ryan on the other.  Or Creed, about whom we learn more and more odd details as the season goes along, culminating in the season finale where he informs us that he likes to steal things.  (Creed, by the way, is played by Creed Bratton, who was a rock star in the sixties as lead guitarist for the famous group the Grassroots, which had a string of huge hits including ""Midnight Confession"" and ""Let's Live for Today."")  As we get to know the various members of the office and pick up on the intricate interplay between the various personalities, the show becomes more and more irresistible.THE OFFICE follows a trend in the best American television comedy to move away from the situation comedies that has long dominated our comedy.  Most shows have been shot in front of a live studio audience, filmed with three or more cameras, performing each scene more than once in order to have alternate takes for the final version.  But wonderfully innovative shows like MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, and SCRUBS has abandoned the situation comedy format and opted for a more realistic format.  Like ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, THE OFFICE takes on a documentary style, shooting the film on hand held video, which not only gives the show a more spontaneous feel, but avoids the expensive camera and lighting set ups that adds a lot of time to shooting.  I think this is a great trend and I personally would love to see the live audience situation comedy disappear entirely.With the unfortunate demise of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT (I still haven't recovered from that shock of its disappearance), THE OFFICE becomes the finest and most innovative comedy on American television (its only rival for the title being SCRUBS).  There are still a few diehard fans of the BBC series that won't give this one a try.  They should.  It not only does great honor to the British show, it has become an absolutely wonderful show in its own right.",5,An absolutely brilliant Season Two for what could well be the best comedy on

172163,AGSWTH7SP2256,1417009446,R. W. Rasband,"[11, 11]","Like a lot of people, when I heard NBC was going to make an American version of the classic British comedy ""The Office"", I just hoped it would go away quickly without a lot of fuss (especially after the smoking ruin that was the idiotic attempt with ""Coupling"", another great British show.)  Imagine my surprise when this ""The Office"" turned out to be great, with some tweaks that make it quintessentially American.  The British version, while hilarious, is also unremittingly bleak and cruel, with only the slimmest margin of hope.  It would probably be impossible to tune in week after week to an exact replica (there are only around 12 episodes of the original after all, so those office workers got put out of their misery pretty quickly.)  The producer of the new series, Greg Daniels, worked on the funnyKing of the Hill - The Complete First Seasonand brought that series' compassion, guarded optimism, and skewed humanity with him, and it's a perfect fit here.  I'm still a little amazed that a show with such an unusual fake-documentary format, complex characters, and smart writing has turned into a hit.  But I was also shocked when ""Seinfeld"" found its audience, so I should just be grateful.The excellence of Steve Carell shouldn't be overlooked in our rush to embrace Jim/Pam.  In Michael Scott he has created one of television's most remarkable jerks, right up there with Archie Bunker.  Ricky Gervais' original boss, David Brent, is his equal in neediness and obnoxiousness, but the crucial difference is that Michael has a conscience and a dim awareness that there are other people in the world.  So we see those excruciating scenes when he says something unforgivable, but he knows it (this is really true in the episode ""The Fight"" on this DVD set, where both Michael and Jim realize they have taken things too far.)  We know guys like this; maybe we are guys like this.This show has the most amazing cast: in Dwight Schrute, Rainn Wilson has created a pop culture icon (and a far more nuanced character than his British counterpart, the hideous Gareth.)  John Krasinski is charismatic as Jim, but he also lets us see Jim's callowness and immaturity.  And what else can one say about Jenna Fischer, the queen of the nerds, as Pam?  She is both glowing and dejected as the mousy receptionist who doesn't realize how wonderful she is.  As someone wrote, when she's around Jim ""she shines like a Christmas tree.""  Which makes the season finale, ""Casino Night"", and the first few episodes of Season 3, all the more crushing.  Watching the self-destructiveness of others is always heartbreaking.Someone once said that life is made up of humiliation and loss, so those are the materials we have to use in order to make something of it.  That's  a rather desolate assessment, but not entirely untrue, I think.  It's a good description of the modus operandi of Season 2 of ""The Office"" as well.

There's sophisticated verbal humor, clever pranks and all-around great comedic pace and timing; the actors work wonderfully off each other in scenes that are allowed time to play out.  The show does well with drama too (as seen with the Jim-Pam-Roy triangle), and Season 2 has given all of the characters, even the minor ones, a chance to develop and let their personal quirks and eccentricities shine; compared to Season 1, Season 2 has more of an ensemble feel, even though it still has a core of main characters.The main reason the show is so strong is that it's essentially all about the characters, and the humor is rooted in their personalities.  Dwight Schrute, for instance, is a legendary comedic creation - to call him the strange, authoritarian office geek is not doing him enough justice.  You have to see Rainn Wilson bring him to life, working off the wonderful scripts.  Also, I recommend watching the blooper reel.  It has some hilarious footage of Wilson cracking up while delivering Dwight's lines; he has a really infectious laugh and often laughs to the point of tears.The humor in The Office is fresh, often odd and unexpected, and definitely not politically correct.  It seems like the cast has such a great time making the show; that playfulness comes across.

Just like Arrested Development, and Curb Your Enthusiasm before it, this is not a show you can jump into the middle of and get a few chuckles from like How I Met Your Mother.  This show has a flow and a style to it that may take you an episode or two to pick up on, but once you discover the rhythm of the comedy and how the jokes unfold, you will realize this is one of the smartest written shows on television.  I am a big fan of the no laugh track, single camera style sitcom, and this show does the genre justice.  The camera really becomes an active character in certain situations and scenes.Even though this is the second season, it's more like the first, considering the first season is 6 episodes long, so this is really where the creators, writers, and actors have the style down and give us one great episode after another.  We get to see the cast outside of the office a little more this season which is cool.  We also get a lot more of a glimpse into all the minor character's lives.  While before they were mostly in the background, now we get to know them as people, including their family lives, interests, dislikes, etc.Of course, it is a comedy first and foremost, but what really gives this show longevity, is the season long arc of Pam and Jim's budding friendship.  The ongoing semi-romance is what really keeps the show afloat and has me coming back for more.  The primary reason this show is so great is because of the characters and their relationships, and as long as they continue developing these characters and giving them complicated story lines, I will watch this show.The Office really has exceeded my expectations as a typical run of the mill Americanized version of a successful British series.  Whether you were a fan of the British version before or not, this is worth watching.  If you're a fan of fake documentary Christopher Guest style improv comedy, you really must see this.  If you enjoy heart felt moments and dramatic undertones mixed in with your comedy, this is for you.",5,Simply fantastic.

Their sensibilities simply aren't taken into account.  I think it is important for there to be some representation of this perspective, and so I will be reviewing this item from the vantage point of a Christian.  In so doing, I mean in no way to offend non-Christians or to suggest that they have no right to their own views on this item and it's characteristics.  Nor do I mean to suggest that mine is the correct or only Christian view.  To each their own, with respect.Honestly, I really enjoy watching ""The Office"", season two.  The show overall is one of my favorites, and season two in particular if funny, a definite improvement over season one.  I give this season four stars, however, because I know that sometimes I enjoy the show when perhaps I shouldn't.  This show is certainly not a model of cleanliness that marked the bygone era when entertainment writers were concerned with offending moral sensibilities.To be sure, compared to much of the entertainment found on TV these days, this show is fairly clean.  There is basically no nudity (in terms of nudity, season two is cleaner than season three) and virtually no violence.  The objectionable material, then, is basically the written content... the humor.  And it is in this area that there are basically two areas of concern.  First, the language.  It is more than a rare occasion that questionable language is used, though clearly explicit language is practically never used.  Second, the humor and innuendo, the subject matter of the humor, is often inappropriate.  The entire show is basically crass.  While I don't think that all crass humor is inappropriate, and neither do I think that all the crass humor in this show is inappropriate, sometimes the humor crosses the that unidentifiable line into the offensive.  Nevertheless, this show has some redeeming qualities.  Aside from the crass humor, the humor of the characters themselves is incredibly funny.  In fact, I think the best part about this show is the strength of the characters and the extent to which they complement each other.Perhaps the most serious challenge this show poses to the Christian faith are the more subtle critiques.  For example, there is not one serious Christian character.  The one character that is purported to be a Christian is really portrayed as a hypocrite and a mockery.  And the few truly endearing characters are clearly not Christian as they live non-Christian lifestyles (namely sleeping with and living with their boyfriends/girlfriends).  Needless to say, there isn't anything in this show that supports Christian morals or displays Christianity in a favorable light.I would hesitate to give this item to anyone younger than 18 (a hesitation I'm sure most of the people reading this will find to be absurd).  What is needed is a viewer who can understand the subtle difference between making light and fun of social indiscretions and endorsing them.  Nevertheless, I think you can generally watch this show as a Christian without compromising your faith.",4,A Christian Perspective,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,3174,"['**', 'Disclaimer', 'Especially', 'world', 'popular', 'culture', 'often', 'difficult', 'Christians', 'receive', 'information', 'own', 'perspective', 'sensibilities', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'taken', 'account', 'think', 'important', 'be', 'representation', 'perspective', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'reviewing', 'item', 'vantage', 'point', 'Christian', 'so', 'doing', 'mean', 'way', 'offend', 'non-Christians', 'suggest', 'have', 'right', 'own', 'views', 'item', 'characteristics', 'do', 'mean', 'suggest', 'mine', 'correct', 'only', 'Christian', 'view', 'own', 'respect.Honestly', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Office', 'season', 'two', 'show', 'overall', 'one', 'favorites', 'season', 'two', 'particular', 'funny', 'definite', 'improvement', 'season', 'one', 'give', 'season', 'four', 'stars', 'however', 'know', 'sometimes', 'enjoy', 'show', 'when', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'show', 'certainly', 'not', 'model', 'cleanliness', 'marked', 'bygone', 'era', 'when', 'entertainment', 'writers', 'were', 'concerned', 'offending', 'moral', 'sensibilities.To', 'be', 'sure', 'compared', 'much', 'entertainment', 'found', 'TV', 'days', 'show', 'fairly', 'clean', 'basically', 'nudity', 'terms', 'nudity', 'season', 'two', 'cleaner', 'season', 'three', 'virtually', 'violence', 'objectionable', 'material', 'then', 'basically', 'written', 'content', 'humor', 'area', 'are', 'basically', 'two', 'areas', 'concern', 'First', 'language', 'more', 'rare', 'occasion', 'questionable', 'language', 'used', 'clearly', 'explicit', 'language', 'practically', 'never', 'used', 'Second', 'humor', 'innuendo', 'subject', 'matter', 'humor', 'often', 'inappropriate', 'entire', 'show', 'basically', 'crass', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'crass', 'humor', 'inappropriate', 'neither', 'do', 'think', 'crass', 'humor', 'show', 'inappropriate', 'sometimes', 'humor', 'unidentifiable', 'line', 'offensive', 'Nevertheless', 'show', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Aside', 'crass', 'humor', 'humor', 'characters', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'fact', 'think', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'strength', 'characters', 'extent', 'complement', 'other.Perhaps', 'most', 'serious', 'challenge', 'show', 'Christian', 'faith', 'are', 'more', 'subtle', 'critiques', 'example', 'not', 'one', 'serious', 'Christian', 'character', 'one', 'character', 'purported', 'be', 'Christian', 'really', 'portrayed', 'hypocrite', 'mockery', 'few', 'truly', 'endearing', 'characters', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'Christian', 'live', 'non-Christian', 'lifestyles', 'namely', 'sleeping', 'living', 'boyfriends/girlfriends', 'Needless', 'say', ""n't"", 'anything', 'show', 'Christian', 'morals', 'displays', 'Christianity', 'favorable', 'light.I', 'would', 'hesitate', 'give', 'item', 'anyone', 'younger', '18', 'hesitation', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'reading', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'absurd', 'What', 'needed', 'viewer', 'who', 'can', 'understand', 'subtle', 'difference', 'making', 'light', 'fun', 'social', 'indiscretions', 'endorsing', 'Nevertheless', 'think', 'can', 'generally', 'watch', 'show', 'Christian', 'compromising', 'faith']",N/A

In comparison to the British inspiration these shows were good but it's clear that the series hadn't found its own voice yet. That can't be said of the glorious, hilarious second season which actually surpasses its inspiration. Steve Carell can sell things with such sincerity and plays the role of Michael so perfectly straight that his deadpan approach fits the series like a glove.An excellent transfer from Universal ""The Office"" looks marvelous in this transfer. The show is shot in HD video so there aren't any analog problems that crop up. Audio sounds terrific as well the box says it's 5.1 but it sounded like a 5.0 mix to me although the surround speakers are used well for ambient sound keep in mind this is a dialogue driven show like most sitcoms.We have bloopers, parodies of the ""The More You Know"" commercial spots that NBC periodically runs on topics such as not eating black jellybeans, meteors, using the word smell in everyday conversation, taping sex (and forgetting to erase it). ""Steve on Steve"" faces himself in interview for both ""The Office"" and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". It's pretty clever. The ""Olympic Promos"" are pretty funny as well. We also get on 10 episodes featuring a variety of cast and crew. I only had time to listen to a couple of them and both were amusing at the very least. The two I had time to listen to for this review were ""Drug Testing"" and ""Casino Night"" two of my favorites from this season (they also happen to be the last two episodes of the season as well). Unfortunately Steve Carell doesn't appear on either one of these commentary tracks (as producer/writer Greg Daniels jokingly notes on ""Casino Night"" which Carell wrote, ""he's too busy working on his movie career"". In fact he doesn't appear on any of the tracks as he was in the midst of shooting a film.Disc three features ""The Faces of Scranton"" the short film that Michael made for one episode. It's amusing. Back on disc four we have the webisodes are pretty amusing as well but they lack a play all feature so you have to go back to the special features menu to play them individually. It's odd that this was forgotten but a minor annoyance. There are also two hours of deleted scenes throughout the set. Interestingly a couple of cast members write as well as appear in the series which probably accounts for the fact that it found its own creative and comedic voice surpassing the original British series during its second season. The deleted scenes usually follow each episode and can be played individually.A dry, hilarious sitcom about the misadventures in the workplace, ""The Office"" came into its own during its second season departing from the British inspiration. The show managed to find its own voice and tone with the appealing writing of Daniels, Carell and cast member B. J. Novak among others. The extras are terrific and, with the exception of some minor issues such as the deleted scenes not being presented in enhanced 16X9 mode (which means they're letterboxed for those who have widescreen TVs) and the lack of a ""play all"" feature for the webisodes this is a pretty terrific set. The first season only consisted of six episodes so fans of the show will be in heaven with this set. Every one of the episodes from the ""The Dundies"" to the faux award show to the episode on ""Sexual Harassment"" to ""Casino Night"" there are no misfires during season two. This is a gem of a set well worth picking up for fans of the show. I would suggest renting though for those folks who haven't watched the show to see if the dry humor of the series will appeal to you.",5,Second season pure comedic genius,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,3692,"['When', 'Office', 'first', 'appeared', 'NBC', 'show', 'used', 'many', 'basic', 'plots', 'brief', 'first', 'season', 'comparison', 'British', 'inspiration', 'shows', 'were', 'good', 'clear', 'series', 'had', ""n't"", 'found', 'own', 'voice', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'glorious', 'hilarious', 'second', 'season', 'actually', 'inspiration', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'can', 'sell', 'things', 'such', 'sincerity', 'role', 'Michael', 'so', 'perfectly', 'straight', 'deadpan', 'approach', 'series', 'glove.An', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'Universal', 'Office', 'marvelous', 'transfer', 'show', 'shot', 'HD', 'video', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'analog', 'problems', 'crop', 'up', 'Audio', 'terrific', 'as', 'well', 'box', '5.1', 'sounded', '5.0', 'mix', 'surround', 'speakers', 'are', 'used', 'well', 'ambient', 'sound', 'keep', 'mind', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'show', 'most', 'sitcoms.We', 'have', 'bloopers', 'parodies', 'More', 'Know', 'commercial', 'spots', 'NBC', 'periodically', 'topics', 'such', 'not', 'eating', 'black', 'jellybeans', 'meteors', 'using', 'word', 'smell', 'everyday', 'conversation', 'taping', 'sex', 'forgetting', 'erase', 'Steve', 'Steve', 'interview', 'Office', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'pretty', 'clever', 'Olympic', 'Promos', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'get', '10', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'variety', 'cast', 'crew', 'only', 'had', 'time', 'listen', 'couple', 'were', 'amusing', 'very', 'least', 'two', 'had', 'time', 'listen', 'review', 'were', 'Drug', 'Testing', 'Casino', 'Night', 'two', 'favorites', 'season', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'Steve', 'Carell', ""n't"", 'appear', 'one', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'producer/writer', 'Greg', 'Daniels', 'jokingly', 'Casino', 'Night', 'Carell', 'wrote', 'too', 'busy', 'working', 'movie', 'career', 'fact', ""n't"", 'appear', 'tracks', 'was', 'midst', 'shooting', 'film.Disc', 'three', 'Faces', 'Scranton', 'short', 'film', 'Michael', 'made', 'one', 'episode', 'amusing', 'Back', 'disc', 'four', 'have', 'webisodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'play', 'feature', 'so', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'special', 'features', 'menu', 'play', 'individually', 'odd', 'was', 'forgotten', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'hours', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'set', 'Interestingly', 'couple', 'cast', 'members', 'write', 'as', 'well', 'appear', 'series', 'probably', 'accounts', 'fact', 'found', 'own', 'creative', 'comedic', 'voice', 'surpassing', 'original', 'British', 'series', 'second', 'season', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'usually', 'follow', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'individually.A', 'dry', 'hilarious', 'sitcom', 'misadventures', 'workplace', 'Office', 'came', 'own', 'second', 'season', 'departing', 'British', 'inspiration', 'show', 'managed', 'find', 'own', 'voice', 'tone', 'appealing', 'writing', 'Daniels', 'Carell', 'cast', 'member', 'B.', 'J.', 'Novak', 'others', 'extras', 'are', 'terrific', 'exception', 'minor', 'issues', 'such', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'not', 'being', 'presented', 'enhanced', '16X9', 'mode', ""'re"", 'letterboxed', 'who', 'have', 'widescreen', 'TVs', 'lack', 'play', 'feature', 'webisodes', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'consisted', 'six', 'episodes', 'so', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'heaven', 'set', 'one', 'episodes', 'Dundies', 'faux', 'award', 'show', 'episode', 'Sexual', 'Harassment', 'Casino', 'Night', 'are', 'misfires', 'season', 'two', 'gem', 'set', 'well', 'picking', 'up', 'fans', 'show', 'would', 'suggest', 'renting', 'folks', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'show', 'see', 'dry', 'humor', 'series', 'will', 'appeal']",N/A
172183,AP3B615GM191G,1417009446,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","The first ""season"" (six episodes) of The Office was little more than a sort of ""trial run"" to see whether or not the British sensation would catch on with an American audience.  Once it proved that it could be hilarious, however, this second season cemented the show as one of the funniest (and most touching) comedies of all time.The biggest, most interesting, and most dramatic theme of the second season is the relationship between Pam Beasley (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski).  On one hand, you will laugh along with them as they make fun of boss Michael Scott (Steve Carell), play pranks on office suck-up Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and make the boring Scranton branch of the Dunder-Mifflin paper supply company as fun as possible in their own little discreet way.  Besides the comedy, though, you will also be touched by the genuineness of their casual flirtings/friendship despite the fact that anything more just doesn't seem destined to be.  For a comedy, the writers do a remarkable job of making you care about both Jim and Pam, as (at least in this season of the show) they really are the backbone of the whole experience.Lest we forget the comedic genius of Carell as Michael Scott, though, this season also sees his character grow in new and always hilarious ways.  His ""relationship"" with boss Jan provides plenty of opportunities for hilarity, as do company work days devoted to such topics as diversity and sexual harassment.  Michael always seems to come through with the best possible line in the worst possible situation, and that is what makes him so hilarious.Finally, again building off of the success of the first six episodes, I continued to be impressed by the ability of the writers/creators to keep the plots and relationships moving forward from episode to episode.  While many half-hour comedies stagnate and let their protagonists fall into the same routine and same old jokes every week, The Office advances the formula in order to keep things fresh.Thus, if you in any way, shape, or form enjoyed the first season of ""The Office"", this second installment will not disappoint you whatsoever, as it continues to both tickle the funny bone and pull at the heartstrings...often at the same time!",5,"Builds On The Momentum Of Previous ""Trial Run""",1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,2244,"['first', 'season', 'six', 'episodes', 'Office', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'sort', 'trial', 'run', 'see', 'not', 'British', 'sensation', 'would', 'catch', 'American', 'audience', 'proved', 'could', 'be', 'hilarious', 'however', 'second', 'season', 'cemented', 'show', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'touching', 'comedies', 'time.The', 'biggest', 'most', 'interesting', 'most', 'dramatic', 'theme', 'second', 'season', 'relationship', 'Pam', 'Beasley', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'Jim', 'Halpert', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'one', 'hand', 'will', 'laugh', 'make', 'fun', 'boss', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'play', 'pranks', 'office', 'suck-up', 'Dwight', 'Schrute', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'make', 'boring', 'Scranton', 'branch', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'paper', 'supply', 'company', 'as', 'fun', 'possible', 'own', 'little', 'discreet', 'way', 'comedy', 'though', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'touched', 'genuineness', 'casual', 'flirtings/friendship', 'fact', 'anything', 'more', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'destined', 'be', 'comedy', 'writers', 'do', 'remarkable', 'job', 'making', 'care', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'least', 'season', 'show', 'really', 'are', 'backbone', 'whole', 'experience.Lest', 'forget', 'comedic', 'genius', 'Carell', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'though', 'season', 'also', 'character', 'grow', 'new', 'always', 'hilarious', 'ways', 'relationship', 'boss', 'Jan', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'hilarity', 'do', 'company', 'work', 'days', 'devoted', 'such', 'topics', 'diversity', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'Michael', 'always', 'come', 'best', 'possible', 'line', 'worst', 'possible', 'situation', 'what', 'so', 'hilarious.Finally', 'again', 'building', 'success', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'continued', 'be', 'impressed', 'ability', 'writers/creators', 'keep', 'plots', 'relationships', 'moving', 'forward', 'episode', 'episode', 'many', 'half-hour', 'comedies', 'stagnate', 'let', 'protagonists', 'fall', 'same', 'routine', 'same', 'old', 'jokes', 'week', 'Office', 'formula', 'order', 'keep', 'things', 'fresh.Thus', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'Office', 'second', 'installment', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'whatsoever', 'funny', 'bone', 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'often', 'same', 'time']",N/A
