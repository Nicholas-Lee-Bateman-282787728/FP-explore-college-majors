The story is told from the mouths of the people who lived through those times like Harry Hay, Barbara Gittings, Audre Lorde, Allen Ginsberg and others, and provides photos, news-clippings, and personal home movies and talks about the importance of underground 'zines that helped gay and lesbians connect with one another.The doc also shows the beginnings of LGBT groups like ""The Mattachine Society"" and ""Daughters of Billitis"" during the late 50s, and features a reunion of workers and patrons of San Francisco gay bar from the 50s ""The Black Cat.""BEFORE... came out on PBS in 1985 and ""first-run-features"" has done an excellent job cleaning up the footage. Of course it doesn't look as though it were done recently, but it's passable. The film runs at about 87-minutes and the special features include: blurry interview with Allen Ginsberg who reads two of his poems; additional interviews with Audre Lorde and Yvonne Flowers; additional footage of The Black Cat bar reunion and interview with Jose Sarria.",5,M*U*S*T H*A*V*E!,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,1394,"['BEFORE', 'STONEWALL', 'dvd', 'one', 'three', 'must', 'have', 'documentaries', 'LGBT', 'people', 'others', 'beingAfter', 'StonewallandParis', 'Is', 'Burning', '.Chronicling', 'time', 'roaring', '20s', 'just', 'Stonewall', 'riots', '1969', 'STONEWALL', 'viewer', 'journey', 'struggle', 'men', 'lesbians', 'have', 'faced', 'go', 'isolation', 'finding', 'others', 'story', 'told', 'mouths', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'times', 'Harry', 'Hay', 'Barbara', 'Gittings', 'Audre', 'Lorde', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'others', 'photos', 'news-clippings', 'personal', 'home', 'movies', 'talks', 'importance', 'underground', ""'zines"", 'helped', 'gay', 'lesbians', 'connect', 'one', 'another.The', 'doc', 'also', 'beginnings', 'LGBT', 'groups', 'Mattachine', 'Society', 'Daughters', 'Billitis', 'late', '50s', 'reunion', 'workers', 'patrons', 'San', 'Francisco', 'gay', 'bar', '50s', 'Black', 'Cat.', 'came', 'out', 'PBS', '1985', 'first-run-features', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'cleaning', 'up', 'footage', 'course', ""n't"", 'look', 'were', 'done', 'recently', 'passable', 'film', '87-minutes', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'blurry', 'interview', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'who', 'two', 'poems', 'additional', 'interviews', 'Audre', 'Lorde', 'Yvonne', 'Flowers', 'additional', 'footage', 'Black', 'Cat', 'bar', 'reunion', 'interview', 'Jose', 'Sarria']",N/A
813301,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0001US7TU,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","BEFORE STONEWALL, though as documentaries go is a bit heavy on personal memories and nostalgia, is otherwise perfect. It explains in ironically straightforward terms the gay history of America. In fact, on second thought it may be that the personal reminiscences add to the flavor of the film, because the interviewees are so colorful and memorable--and they are eloquent. I particularly love listening to Harry Hay, founder of the old Mattachine Society.It is natural that this film can only probe as far back as the memories of the interviewees allow: lots of reminiscences of the ""demimonde"" or ""twilight world"" of the 1920s and 1930s. Mostly, BEFORE STONEWALL leans on WWII and the fact that any gay rights movement worthy of the name in America began in the military during the war. One very charming gentleman recalls attending a lecture by gay icon and scientist Magnus Hirschfeld, who was battling for gay rights since the end of the 19th century.While the interviewees reminisce about World War II and then the McCarthy crap, they give powerful insights to the state of the gay community. This film shocked me when it divulged that the gay generation it covers was a generation of isolated, miserable people who had no idea there were others like them. At the same time, the film covers some of the silly media portrayal of ""homosexual perversion"".There is nothing lacking in this documentary--but I am especially happy that it is very LOW on erotica. Too many gay-themed films are quite frankly so disgusting that I cannot bear to watch them (i.e., Stephen Fry in the title role inWilde). This documentary, narrated by Rita Mae Brown, is almost clean enough to show in schools. In fact I think high school level kids could handle it in their stride, and they'd learn all there is to learn about our sad, revolting gay history.This does not shy away from the days when gay people were treated much worse than blacks, had no rights at all and could be jailed or institutionalized at the drop of a 6"" stiletto-heel. It was riveting to hear the lesbian remember how she had been arrested for institutionalization--her own mother dropped the dime on her after learning she was a lesbian.This film is THE object lesson, and all interested folk need this on their DVD shelves.",5,Gay History Part I,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,2279,"['STONEWALL', 'though', 'documentaries', 'go', 'bit', 'heavy', 'personal', 'memories', 'nostalgia', 'otherwise', 'perfect', 'ironically', 'straightforward', 'terms', 'gay', 'history', 'America', 'fact', 'second', 'thought', 'may', 'be', 'personal', 'reminiscences', 'add', 'flavor', 'film', 'interviewees', 'are', 'so', 'colorful', 'memorable', 'are', 'eloquent', 'particularly', 'love', 'listening', 'Harry', 'Hay', 'founder', 'old', 'Mattachine', 'Society.It', 'natural', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'probe', 'far', 'back', 'memories', 'interviewees', 'allow', 'lots', 'reminiscences', 'demimonde', 'twilight', 'world', '1920s', '1930s', 'Mostly', 'STONEWALL', 'WWII', 'fact', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'worthy', 'name', 'America', 'began', 'military', 'war', 'One', 'very', 'charming', 'gentleman', 'attending', 'lecture', 'gay', 'icon', 'scientist', 'Magnus', 'Hirschfeld', 'who', 'was', 'battling', 'gay', 'rights', 'end', '19th', 'century.While', 'interviewees', 'reminisce', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'then', 'McCarthy', 'crap', 'give', 'powerful', 'insights', 'state', 'gay', 'community', 'film', 'shocked', 'when', 'divulged', 'gay', 'generation', 'was', 'generation', 'isolated', 'miserable', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'idea', 'there', 'were', 'others', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'silly', 'media', 'portrayal', 'homosexual', 'perversion', 'nothing', 'lacking', 'documentary', 'am', 'especially', 'happy', 'very', 'LOW', 'erotica', 'Too', 'many', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'frankly', 'so', 'disgusting', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'watch', 'i.e.', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'title', 'role', 'inWilde', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Rita', 'Mae', 'Brown', 'almost', 'clean', 'enough', 'show', 'schools', 'fact', 'think', 'high', 'school', 'level', 'kids', 'could', 'handle', 'stride', ""'d"", 'learn', 'learn', 'sad', 'revolting', 'gay', 'history.This', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'days', 'when', 'gay', 'people', 'were', 'treated', 'much', 'worse', 'blacks', 'had', 'rights', 'could', 'be', 'jailed', 'institutionalized', 'drop', '6', 'stiletto-heel', 'was', 'riveting', 'hear', 'lesbian', 'remember', 'how', 'had', 'been', 'arrested', 'institutionalization', 'own', 'mother', 'dropped', 'dime', 'learning', 'was', 'lesbian.This', 'film', 'object', 'lesson', 'interested', 'folk', 'need', 'DVD', 'shelves']",N/A
813302,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0001US7TU,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[4, 5]","It is sometimes necessary to explain what Stonewall was.  In 1960s New York, it was illegal to be homosexual, and gays and lesbian bars were generally mob controlled venues that made pay offs to the police in order to stay open.  Located in the gay enclave of Greenwich Village, Stonewall was a seedy bar where watered-down drinks were the norm and the owners didn't much care if you liked it or not: you took it or left it.  From time to time the police came around; most of the time they were looking for a pay off, but sometimes they had instructions to crack down on vice.  And that is what happened on 27 June 1969, with police officers arresting bar patrons.  But on this occasion tempers flared.  The bar patrons had had enough and they fought back.  The battle spilled into the street, the police took cover inside the bar, and the gays and lesbians tried to burn it down with the police inside.  The Stonewall Riots continued on and off for several days, shutting down a big chunk of New York in the process.  Today the riots are seen as the turning point in the struggle for gay and lesbian equality.Well, maybe.  The trouble with people who live in New York and Los Angeles and other major urban areas is that they usually discount everybody else, and the stories presented by BEFORE STONEWALL are very much those of gays and lesbians living in major urban areas and struggling against the odds to reach some sort of happy ending.  (The only arrest footage in the film shows the drag queens waving happily for the camera.)  The film doesn't have much to say about the really bad things that happened, the murders and the deaths, the forced shocked treatments, those who lived in terror in small town hells from one end of the country to another.  What emerges is a highly sanitized portrait of the American 20th Century gay and lesbian movement that seems calculated to please liberal heterosexuals instead of inform about the triumphs and failures of the pre-1960s movement.  As for Stonewall being a turning point, no doubt it was--in New York.  Truth is, it didn't actually receive much coverage at the time.  I'd say the national turning point came a decade later when Anita Bryant discovered gays and lesbians had enough leverage to have her fired as spokeswoman for Florida orange juice and when Harvey Milk showed that gays and lesbians could actually be elected to public office.That said, BEFORE STONEWALL is a nice little feel-good documentary with the occasional glimpse of an interesting interview, such as Harry Hay, who was both adored and reviled (typically of this film, you don't get any of the latter), Martin Duberman (who starts to talk about how he sought a ""cure"" but never really goes anywhere with the story), and a reunion of those who frequented a bar called The Black Cat (and they, at least, are genuinely fun.)  When all is said and done, BEFORE STONEWALL is upbeat, peppy, and tries to make you feel that the bad old days probably weren't quite so bad after all.  Recommended, but keep your salt shaker hander, because you'll need to watch it with more than few grains of salt.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Entertaining but Largely Irrelevant and Inaccurate Portrait of the Pre-1960s Gay Community,1304035200,"04 29, 2011",2011,3138,"['sometimes', 'necessary', 'explain', 'what', 'Stonewall', 'was', '1960s', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'illegal', 'be', 'homosexual', 'gays', 'lesbian', 'bars', 'were', 'generally', 'mob', 'controlled', 'venues', 'made', 'pay', 'offs', 'police', 'order', 'stay', 'open', 'Located', 'gay', 'enclave', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'Stonewall', 'was', 'seedy', 'bar', 'where', 'watered-down', 'drinks', 'were', 'norm', 'owners', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'liked', 'not', 'took', 'left', 'time', 'time', 'police', 'came', 'around', 'most', 'time', 'were', 'looking', 'pay', 'off', 'sometimes', 'had', 'instructions', 'crack', 'down', 'vice', 'what', 'happened', '27', 'June', '1969', 'police', 'officers', 'arresting', 'bar', 'patrons', 'occasion', 'tempers', 'flared', 'bar', 'patrons', 'had', 'had', 'enough', 'fought', 'back', 'battle', 'spilled', 'street', 'police', 'took', 'cover', 'bar', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'tried', 'burn', 'down', 'police', 'inside', 'Stonewall', 'Riots', 'continued', 'several', 'days', 'shutting', 'down', 'big', 'chunk', 'New', 'York', 'process', 'Today', 'riots', 'are', 'seen', 'turning', 'point', 'struggle', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'equality.Well', 'maybe', 'trouble', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'other', 'major', 'urban', 'areas', 'usually', 'discount', 'everybody', 'else', 'stories', 'presented', 'STONEWALL', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'living', 'major', 'urban', 'areas', 'struggling', 'odds', 'reach', 'sort', 'happy', 'ending', 'only', 'arrest', 'footage', 'film', 'drag', 'waving', 'happily', 'camera', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'really', 'bad', 'things', 'happened', 'murders', 'deaths', 'forced', 'shocked', 'treatments', 'who', 'lived', 'terror', 'small', 'town', 'hells', 'one', 'end', 'country', 'What', 'highly', 'sanitized', 'portrait', 'American', '20th', 'Century', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'movement', 'calculated', 'please', 'liberal', 'heterosexuals', 'instead', 'inform', 'triumphs', 'failures', 'pre-1960s', 'movement', 'Stonewall', 'being', 'turning', 'point', 'doubt', 'was', 'New', 'York', 'Truth', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'receive', 'much', 'coverage', 'time', ""'d"", 'say', 'national', 'turning', 'point', 'came', 'decade', 'later', 'when', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'discovered', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'had', 'enough', 'leverage', 'have', 'fired', 'spokeswoman', 'Florida', 'orange', 'juice', 'when', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'showed', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'elected', 'public', 'office.That', 'said', 'BEFORE', 'STONEWALL', 'nice', 'little', 'feel-good', 'documentary', 'occasional', 'glimpse', 'interesting', 'interview', 'such', 'Harry', 'Hay', 'who', 'was', 'adored', 'reviled', 'typically', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'latter', 'Martin', 'Duberman', 'who', 'talk', 'how', 'sought', 'cure', 'never', 'really', 'anywhere', 'story', 'reunion', 'who', 'frequented', 'bar', 'called', 'Black', 'Cat', 'least', 'are', 'genuinely', 'fun', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'STONEWALL', 'upbeat', 'peppy', 'tries', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'old', 'days', 'probably', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'bad', 'Recommended', 'keep', 'salt', 'shaker', 'hander', ""'ll"", 'need', 'watch', 'more', 'few', 'grains', 'salt.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

With a plethora of interviews, people telling their own stories, it's amazing what it does cover. While the depth of the history may be somewhat lacking, the real impact of the document is an understanding of the roots of where the gay movement came from.It seems as we enter times of trial and tribulation, it's important to understand our roots. It's those roots, based in the stories that are in this movie, that ground us and help instill a sense a pride in where we've come from, and where we'll be going. With that pride comes strength, strength of will, strength of character. The people who so bravely walked before us, in the 1920's where wearing a red tie with matching hanky was the most obvious sign, to those impressive drag queens who finally decided that enough was enough, are our sources of self-empowerment.Watch the documentary, buy it, and be ready.",5,It Started in the Past...,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,1247,"['many', 'seeds', 'gay', 'liberation', 'movement', 'started', 'nights', 'Stonewall', 'when', 'group', 'people', 'just', 'decided', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'take', 'anymore', 'However', 'was', 'gay', 'life', 'Stonewall', 'documented', 'fast', 'paced', 'documentary.The', 'movie', 'attempts', 'collapse', 'forty', 'years', 'gay', 'history', 'documentary', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'plethora', 'interviews', 'people', 'telling', 'own', 'stories', 'amazing', 'what', 'cover', 'depth', 'history', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'real', 'impact', 'document', 'understanding', 'roots', 'where', 'gay', 'movement', 'came', 'from.It', 'enter', 'times', 'trial', 'tribulation', 'important', 'understand', 'roots', 'roots', 'based', 'stories', 'are', 'movie', 'ground', 'help', 'instill', 'sense', 'pride', 'where', ""'ve"", 'come', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'going', 'pride', 'strength', 'strength', 'will', 'strength', 'character', 'people', 'who', 'so', 'bravely', 'walked', '1920', 'where', 'wearing', 'red', 'tie', 'matching', 'hanky', 'was', 'most', 'obvious', 'sign', 'impressive', 'drag', 'queens', 'who', 'finally', 'decided', 'enough', 'was', 'enough', 'are', 'sources', 'self-empowerment.Watch', 'documentary', 'buy', 'be', 'ready']",N/A
813304,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B0001US7TU,J. Michael Click,"[16, 16]","Originally produced for PBS television, the Emmy-winning ""Before Stonewall"" is a must-see documentary for anyone researching Gay American history.  What makes this film so invaluable is its success in recreating - through photographs, film clips, and later-day interviews - a period in time that was carefully and deliberately NOT recorded as it was happening due to the pervasive institution of ""the closet"", and the very real dangers that faced those brave enough to crack open the door and step out into the light.  As one courageous lesbian pioneer remembers, just being accused of being a gay woman was grounds for involuntary commitment to a mental institution during her youth.  Small wonder, then, that there is such a paucity of material documenting the gay movement pre-Stonewall, especially during the years from 1900-1950, before the earliest Gay and Lesbian social and political institutions in the United States were founded.The cornerstone of this remarkable film is the handful of interviews conducted with some elderly activists from the years before the Stonewall riots began on June 27, 1969.  With humor, dignity, and matter-of-fact courage, these men and women tell personal stories about their experiences in the armed forces, in the halls of government, in society, and in their home lives during the years in which America at large experienced the roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, the Second World War, the beginning of the Baby Boom era, and the radical Sixties.  Their recollections are not only fascinating and brilliantly told; they are of critical importance in understanding the true heritage and history of today's American gay community.  The DVD edition offers some fascinating extra material, including some expanded interviews, and footage of poet Allen Ginsberg reading two of his early compositions.
