821575,AR3BZOTB7IY78,B000228SIM,Anton Karidian,"[0, 1]","I've got several DVDs from Surrender Cinema, but this is definitely NOT one of the better ones. Judging from several of the other reviews on here, I must have gotten the edited version of ANDROMINA, since on my copy the sex and nude scenes are really short and tame, although my copy does not show any rating at all. Several times a couple of the ladies are shown nude only for 5 to 10 seconds before the movie switches to another scene!! There's one odd scene where 2 of the ladies get in a fight, tearing off each other's clothes, but they're hardly shown without clothes AT ALL, and the film there has clearly been severely and sloppily cut. The longest sex scenes run maybe 1 minute or so, which is also short compared to similar movies, and really are just the beginnings of sex scenes. Even the way most of them are filmed is tame. For instance, on some scenes the camera only shows the actors' upper bodies.The premise of the movie is ludicrous too, with some male ""astronauts"" going to a ""pleasure planet"" full of women to look for some ladies to work in a strip club back on Earth. The most absurd aspect is that the women on this ""pleasure planet"" hate men, so WHY would they be good choices for a strip club??? Also, the ""astronauts"" aren't even shown traveling into space. Looks like even on a very low budget the producers could have found some stock footage of a spaceship taking off from Earth! The cover is also misleading, since it shows women in alien makeup, while in the film itself they do not appear alien at all.I was going to give this 2 stars since ANDROMINA does have numerous hot actresses in it and a decent number of nude scenes, as brief as they are. BUT I dropped it to 1 star because the DVD looks bad too, with some odd picture noise, mainly black specks, running through the whole film. I'm trying to figure out what good I can get out of this DVD, but it's not going to be much!",1,"Avoid This One, At Least the Edited Version",1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,1913,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'several', 'DVDs', 'Surrender', 'Cinema', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'Judging', 'several', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'must', 'have', 'gotten', 'edited', 'version', 'ANDROMINA', 'copy', 'sex', 'nude', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'short', 'tame', 'copy', 'not', 'show', 'rating', 'Several', 'times', 'couple', 'ladies', 'are', 'shown', 'nude', 'only', '5', '10', 'seconds', 'movie', 'scene', 'one', 'odd', 'scene', 'where', '2', 'ladies', 'get', 'fight', 'tearing', 'off', 'other', 'clothes', ""'re"", 'hardly', 'shown', 'clothes', 'AT', 'ALL', 'film', 'there', 'clearly', 'been', 'severely', 'sloppily', 'cut', 'longest', 'sex', 'scenes', 'run', 'maybe', '1', 'minute', 'so', 'also', 'short', 'compared', 'similar', 'movies', 'really', 'are', 'just', 'beginnings', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Even', 'way', 'most', 'are', 'filmed', 'tame', 'instance', 'scenes', 'camera', 'only', 'actors', 'upper', 'bodies.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'ludicrous', 'too', 'male', 'astronauts', 'going', 'pleasure', 'planet', 'full', 'women', 'look', 'ladies', 'work', 'strip', 'club', 'back', 'Earth', 'most', 'absurd', 'aspect', 'women', 'pleasure', 'planet', 'hate', 'men', 'WHY', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'choices', 'strip', 'club', 'Also', 'astronauts', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'shown', 'traveling', 'space', 'even', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'stock', 'footage', 'spaceship', 'taking', 'off', 'Earth', 'cover', 'also', 'misleading', 'women', 'alien', 'makeup', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'alien', 'all.I', 'was', 'going', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'ANDROMINA', 'have', 'numerous', 'hot', 'actresses', 'decent', 'number', 'nude', 'scenes', 'as', 'brief', 'are', 'BUT', 'dropped', '1', 'star', 'DVD', 'bad', 'too', 'odd', 'picture', 'noise', 'mainly', 'black', 'specks', 'running', 'whole', 'film', ""'m"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'good', 'can', 'get', 'DVD', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'much']",N/A

The obvious if you like the cover art and think it might be a more r rated Avatar, don't buy this movie. There are no blue girls or waterfalls like in the cover art. But it does have one remarkable and savior in it's mist. One of the leaders on this planet is played by Flower. She is beautiful and reminds me a little of Grace Park from Battlestar Galactica, but is no means as beautiful as Grace. Her scenes are a little disappointing because there wasn't enough skin. The movie itself really has no plot and the acting is quite horrendous and the sex scenes are barely r rated at all.

Munyon,"[0, 0]","I was fortunate enough to get an R-rated version of this film.  it delivers everything and then some that I expected from softcore Surrender Cinema. If I were younger than fifty something, I'd have watched it half a dozen times the first day I got it.  You don't buy this kind of film for the acting ability, music or background architecture.  I can't imagine anybody viewing the R-rated version and being disappointed.  Really attractive women and lots of variety and frequency of them showing off.  The writers, directors, and editors weren't very creative, and well, they don't have to be.

821580,ARHN4R6417BL4,B000228SIM,John J. Thomas III,"[20, 22]","There appear to be several versions of this movie floating around. There is an ""unrated"" version and a ""directors cut"". I know there is a ""directors cut"" on VHS but I don't think a DVD version has been released yet. The DVD ""unrated"" is a bit cleaner then the directors cut in that scenes are shortened and things have been trimmed down. If you saw this movie on t.v. as I did then you saw the directors cut and will probably be very disapointed in the other version(s) as quite a bit is taken out. Its noticeable how much is taken out after seeing two different versions of this movie. One version looks PG 14ish with so much having been taken out and seeing a censored version of a movie with simulated action is kinda pointless.To be clear and to try and help someone avoid being disapointed, as I was, if you really liked this movie on t.v. or saw it on video you probably saw the directors cut and may want to check carefully which version you are getting when you order it. I am not sure the directors cut has come out on DVD yet I only know the copy of the DVD I got when I ordered is way different (a lot toned down) from the vhs directors cut version I got a couple years ago.I gave this product one star.

Andromina is a pleasure planet although all we ever see is a small strip bar with peeling cinder block walls.  The aging proprietress is now all alone as virtual reality has killed the business.  Some space truckers (or whatever) decide to help the place out.  They will go find new girls to work as ""hostesses"".  Now it gets really weird.  Apparently the best place to find women to serve men and play ""hostess"" is a planet where men are forbidden and hated.  Sure.So the group gets to the forbidden planet and encounter various tribes of women.  Apparently, except for a severe-looking blonde with a cattle prod (no lines), all of the women on the planet secretly want men.  Sex, captivity, and seduction fill out the bulk of the movie until Andromeda is ultimately saved.Ok, we know what this film is supposed to do and it does it fairly well.
