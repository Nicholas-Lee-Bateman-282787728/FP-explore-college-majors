960011,A2SRT262WG2WH6,B000CPYWFM,Dave,"[1, 1]","Rob Bell is an excellent speaker, who is full of spiritual insights into questions which most people today are asking.  His small group (we call ours home teams) material series which he has called ""Nooma"" after a phoenym of ""pneuma"" or spirit or breath as it is in the New Testament greek provides excellent material for small group Bible study.  Each video is 11 minutes long, which is an ideal amount of time to present a subject for study.  Each video also includes a complete set of small group discussion questions and appropriate verses to fill out your devotional time.  I've found that with the material provided, you can easily have a devo which lasts an hour an a half, or cut it shorter as you see fit.  This makes the series extremely flexible.This episode, Rain, focuses on a personal experience by Rob Bell and his son as they find themselves alone, and isolated from their camp, and have to endure a long hike back during a rain storm.  Rob relates this experience to our experience in life through the storms that we face.  I found this an excellent analogy, and well fitting for discussion.I only rate this four stars, since this episode is lacking in a lot of the strengths of this series, which include strong Biblical framework, and insight into first century culture.  While this episode is certainly Biblically based, the Bible reflects the main story, rather than being the main story itself.  This is fine, and really valid spiritually, but it is just not my preference.I like it when your group can come up with their own personal stories, to reflect the Biblical truths.  This study was a study of his personal experience almost, and how it relates to the Biblical truths, which somehow seems to dilute the message for me...  I mean this only in terms of small group discussion, since this method seems to say, here is my experience, let me find others like it in the Bible, rather than trying to first understand someone's experience recorded in the Bible and then relating it to our own.  And clearly, in this video, Rob finds his scriptural references by doing a search on the word ""cry"" or ""cry out.""  This works, and is valid way of doing things, but I find it a bit more profound spiritually to start with the Bible first, then relate it to our experieces second.  But that is just my preference.  I've often used this (Rob's) approach to my own classes and lessons, so I can't really fault Rob too much.I've seen a lot of Nooma's recently, but this is one of the two that I've actually used in a small group before and I have to say we had a really really really good discussion out of it.  It clearly has a great message and a lot to say to people.  It is not the best of his video's, but it is a great one, and it might be really relevant to your group.  I highly recommend it.",4,"Great series, not bad first installment...",1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,2813,"['Rob', 'Bell', 'excellent', 'speaker', 'who', 'full', 'spiritual', 'insights', 'questions', 'most', 'people', 'today', 'are', 'asking', 'small', 'group', 'call', 'home', 'teams', 'material', 'series', 'called', 'Nooma', 'phoenym', 'pneuma', 'spirit', 'breath', 'New', 'Testament', 'greek', 'excellent', 'material', 'small', 'group', 'Bible', 'study', 'video', '11', 'minutes', 'long', 'ideal', 'amount', 'time', 'present', 'subject', 'study', 'video', 'also', 'complete', 'set', 'small', 'group', 'discussion', 'questions', 'appropriate', 'verses', 'fill', 'out', 'devotional', 'time', ""'ve"", 'found', 'material', 'provided', 'can', 'easily', 'have', 'devo', 'hour', 'half', 'cut', 'shorter', 'see', 'fit', 'series', 'extremely', 'flexible.This', 'episode', 'Rain', 'personal', 'experience', 'Rob', 'Bell', 'son', 'find', 'alone', 'isolated', 'camp', 'have', 'endure', 'long', 'hike', 'back', 'rain', 'storm', 'Rob', 'experience', 'experience', 'life', 'storms', 'face', 'found', 'excellent', 'analogy', 'well', 'fitting', 'discussion.I', 'only', 'rate', 'four', 'stars', 'episode', 'lacking', 'lot', 'strengths', 'series', 'include', 'strong', 'Biblical', 'framework', 'insight', 'first', 'century', 'culture', 'episode', 'certainly', 'Biblically', 'based', 'Bible', 'main', 'story', 'rather', 'being', 'main', 'story', 'fine', 'really', 'valid', 'spiritually', 'just', 'not', 'preference.I', 'when', 'group', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'personal', 'stories', 'reflect', 'Biblical', 'truths', 'study', 'was', 'study', 'personal', 'experience', 'almost', 'how', 'Biblical', 'truths', 'somehow', 'dilute', 'message', 'mean', 'only', 'terms', 'small', 'group', 'discussion', 'method', 'say', 'here', 'experience', 'let', 'find', 'others', 'Bible', 'rather', 'trying', 'first', 'understand', 'someone', 'experience', 'recorded', 'Bible', 'then', 'relating', 'own', 'clearly', 'video', 'Rob', 'scriptural', 'references', 'doing', 'search', 'word', 'cry', 'cry', 'out', 'valid', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'find', 'bit', 'more', 'profound', 'spiritually', 'start', 'Bible', 'first', 'then', 'relate', 'experieces', 'second', 'just', 'preference', ""'ve"", 'often', 'used', 'Rob', 'approach', 'own', 'classes', 'lessons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'Rob', 'too', 'much.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'Nooma', 'recently', 'one', 'two', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'used', 'small', 'group', 'have', 'say', 'had', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'discussion', 'clearly', 'great', 'message', 'lot', 'say', 'people', 'not', 'best', 'video', 'great', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'really', 'relevant', 'group', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
960012,A137SY2CCOWTP6,B000CPYWFM,David Kenney,"[4, 4]","So the first nooma is Rain. And as I was watching it, I was thinking to myself, `how approproate.' The video short is all about the rain that comes into each of our lives, and the way in which we as children cry out to God through pain and uncertainty.  God responds,""In the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried you, just as a man carries his son, in all the way which you have walked until you came to this place."" ~ Deuteronomy 1v31And as I watched the film, my eyes welling up with tears, I knew first hand the love a Father has for his child. I always think about how inadequate I am to protect my son from danger. I can't be with him every second, I can't prevent car accidents and storms, I can't foresee  bad people with bad intentions, I can't ward off disease... but anything within my power, I would do.I love my son.And I am the King at seeing my own shortcomings. As a pastor there is always that sin of trying to have it all together, to try and look spiritual for everyone looking on. And I'm sure that same attitude will permeate into my role as a Dad. I'll want to be the answer man, the authority figure, the hero, the fix-it, and whatever else...I'll want to be my son's everything.What's amazing to me is that being made in God's image, I inherit that desire from my creator.  God as my Father also wants to be everything to me. Although it isn't for vanity or selfishness that God wants to by first in my life - he has no short comings - He truly is the answer man, the authority figure, the hero, the fix-it and whatever else I need.He will carry me through darkness, trials, temptations, sins, loneliness, and persecution. And he will carry me through this storm as well.Even as I write this, I have been feeling sick today. My first day of `vacation' and I feel ill.  It's just so crazy that there is a God who made all things, who loves all things, who watches over all things - and he still has the desire and the notion to look in on me...to want the best for me...to begin to heal me...to complete a good work through me.Lord, may I feel your arms. May I know your protection and grace. I don't need to see the light or even the road, I don't need securities or hopes as long as you are my light...as long as you are my road. I trust you to carry me.I trust you to carry me.I trust you to carry me.I trust you to carry me.",5,"Lord, I trust you to carry me.",1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,2367,"['first', 'nooma', 'Rain', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'thinking', 'how', 'approproate', 'video', 'short', 'rain', 'lives', 'way', 'children', 'cry', 'out', 'God', 'pain', 'uncertainty', 'God', 'wilderness', 'where', 'saw', 'how', 'LORD', 'God', 'carried', 'just', 'man', 'son', 'way', 'have', 'walked', 'came', 'place', 'Deuteronomy', '1v31And', 'watched', 'film', 'eyes', 'welling', 'up', 'tears', 'knew', 'first', 'hand', 'love', 'Father', 'child', 'always', 'think', 'how', 'inadequate', 'am', 'protect', 'son', 'danger', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'second', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'car', 'accidents', 'storms', 'ca', ""n't"", 'foresee', 'bad', 'people', 'bad', 'intentions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ward', 'off', 'disease', 'anything', 'power', 'would', 'do.I', 'love', 'son.And', 'am', 'King', 'seeing', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'pastor', 'always', 'sin', 'trying', 'have', 'together', 'try', 'look', 'spiritual', 'everyone', 'looking', ""'m"", 'sure', 'same', 'attitude', 'will', 'permeate', 'role', 'Dad', ""'ll"", 'want', 'be', 'answer', 'man', 'authority', 'figure', 'hero', 'fix-it', 'else', ""'ll"", 'want', 'be', 'son', 'everything.What', 'amazing', 'being', 'made', 'God', 'image', 'inherit', 'desire', 'creator', 'God', 'Father', 'also', 'be', 'everything', ""n't"", 'vanity', 'selfishness', 'God', 'first', 'life', 'short', 'comings', 'truly', 'answer', 'man', 'authority', 'figure', 'hero', 'fix-it', 'else', 'need.He', 'will', 'carry', 'darkness', 'trials', 'temptations', 'sins', 'loneliness', 'persecution', 'will', 'carry', 'storm', 'as', 'well.Even', 'write', 'have', 'been', 'feeling', 'sick', 'today', 'first', 'day', 'vacation', 'feel', 'ill', 'just', 'so', 'crazy', 'God', 'who', 'made', 'things', 'who', 'things', 'who', 'things', 'still', 'desire', 'notion', 'look', 'want', 'best', 'begin', 'heal', 'complete', 'good', 'work', 'me.Lord', 'may', 'feel', 'arms', 'May', 'know', 'protection', 'grace', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'light', 'even', 'road', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'securities', 'hopes', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'light', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'road', 'trust', 'carry', 'me.I', 'trust', 'carry', 'me.I', 'trust', 'carry', 'me.I', 'trust', 'carry']",N/A

In this volume, Rob Bell, the pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church in Grandville Michigan, tells the story of a time he and his young son got caught in the middle of a thunderstorm while hiking. Through this story, Rob paints a beautiful picture of God's love for us.God is with us every step of the way. When we can't walk, He carries us.When we're scared, He holds us.His love will see us through any storm. He will never leave us. This DVD gets this point across in a powerful way.Earlier this year I lost two friends in the space of four days. I miss them both. One of them in particular I think of very often.I cannot wait to see her again.This DVD, Rain, reminds me that as intense as my desire is to see my friend again, God is with me here and now.
