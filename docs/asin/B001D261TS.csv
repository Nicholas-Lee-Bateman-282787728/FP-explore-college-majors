1178404,A2KTFTRTY0ONWF,B001D261TS,CarlaVeg,"[108, 108]","I'm very excited about this dvd... I have been having ""crunchy"" knees for a while now and I have been ignoring it. I was told that I have very tight IT bands (Iliotibial bands) and that's what's causing the pain and the cracking.I didn't really do much about my knees until, after working out, I heard a really loud pop coming from my knee cap that hurt A LOT... OUCH! The pain was pretty bad and I couldn't lock my knee or walk right... I was afraid I tear a ligament or had something serious. The doctor said that I have an imbalance in my leg muscles and very tight IT bands and that all I needed was physical therapy (2-3 times a week for 6 weeks).I was glad it wasn't a more serious condition but at the same time I wasn't thrilled about the co-pays for every physical therapy session ($25). I went to PT a few times when I realized I couldn't really spend $450 worth of co-pays. That's when I started searching for cheaper options and found this GREAT and amazing dvd!!!!To my surprise this dvd had ALL exercises I did in my physical therapy sessions and MORE!!!!!!  I WAS SOOOOO THRILLED about finding this DVD. I quit going to PT and did this dvd exclusively almost every day in the comfort of my own home!!! After 3 weeks I can say that my knees are basically back to normal!!!!! This DVD definitely saved my knees!!!!Chantal explanations of the knee anatomy is very important to understand why we need to do the exercises. No doctor or therapist explained to me why the exercises were important for my recovery; therefore, I never believed that the exercises would actually cure my knee problems. Now I do believe that these exercises are the way to go, thanks to Chantal!!! She is very knowledable and down to earth. I love doing this DVD with her every day!!!I usually do the 30 minute routine... if I have more time, I do some of the exersices twice. And if I'm pressed with time, I just do the 7 Minute Save your Knees workout! This option is great!She also explains how to do IT band massages using a tennis ball... I like this method but I also enjoy doing the massages using a foam roller.I recommend this DVD 100% if you have pain in your knees. This DVD has helped me tremendously... and the best part, it cost me less than 1 session of physical therapy!!!!Thanks Chantal for producing such a great DVD!!!!",5,Better than Physical Therapy!!!,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,2325,"[""'m"", 'very', 'excited', 'dvd', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'crunchy', 'knees', 'while', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'ignoring', 'was', 'told', 'have', 'very', 'tight', 'IT', 'Iliotibial', 'bands', 'what', 'causing', 'pain', 'cracking.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'knees', 'working', 'out', 'heard', 'really', 'loud', 'pop', 'coming', 'knee', 'cap', 'LOT', 'pain', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'lock', 'knee', 'walk', 'right', 'was', 'afraid', 'tear', 'ligament', 'had', 'something', 'serious', 'doctor', 'said', 'have', 'imbalance', 'leg', 'muscles', 'very', 'tight', 'IT', 'needed', 'was', 'physical', 'therapy', '2-3', 'times', 'week', '6', 'weeks', '.I', 'was', 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'serious', 'condition', 'same', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'co-pays', 'physical', 'therapy', 'session', '25', 'went', 'PT', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'realized', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'spend', '450', 'worth', 'co-pays', 'when', 'started', 'searching', 'cheaper', 'options', 'found', 'GREAT', 'amazing', 'dvd', 'surprise', 'dvd', 'had', 'ALL', 'exercises', 'did', 'physical', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'MORE', 'WAS', 'SOOOOO', 'THRILLED', 'finding', 'DVD', 'quit', 'going', 'PT', 'did', 'dvd', 'exclusively', 'almost', 'day', 'comfort', 'own', 'home', '3', 'weeks', 'can', 'say', 'knees', 'are', 'basically', 'back', 'normal', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'saved', 'knees', 'Chantal', 'explanations', 'knee', 'anatomy', 'very', 'important', 'understand', 'why', 'need', 'do', 'exercises', 'doctor', 'therapist', 'explained', 'why', 'exercises', 'were', 'important', 'recovery', 'therefore', 'never', 'believed', 'exercises', 'would', 'actually', 'cure', 'knee', 'problems', 'Now', 'do', 'believe', 'exercises', 'are', 'way', 'go', 'thanks', 'Chantal', 'very', 'knowledable', 'down', 'earth', 'love', 'doing', 'DVD', 'day', 'usually', 'do', '30', 'minute', 'routine', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'do', 'exersices', 'twice', ""'m"", 'pressed', 'time', 'just', 'do', '7', 'Minute', 'Save', 'Knees', 'workout', 'option', 'great', 'also', 'how', 'do', 'IT', 'band', 'using', 'tennis', 'ball', 'like', 'method', 'also', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'massages', 'using', 'foam', 'roller.I', 'recommend', 'DVD', '100', '%', 'have', 'pain', 'knees', 'DVD', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'best', 'part', 'cost', 'less', '1', 'session', 'physical', 'therapy', 'Thanks', 'Chantal', 'producing', 'such', 'great', 'DVD']",Strong Knees

1178406,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B001D261TS,Jenny G,"[6, 6]","I hurt my knee towards the end of July after a very quick increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of my workouts on the elliptical trainer. I had been pretty lazy the past year and was to the point I was only using it on weekends, and then went quite suddenly to 6 days a week.  At that point, the grinding noise I had previously ignored turned into a mix of dull pain around the knee cap, and very, very sharp pain under the left knee cap. I had dislocated this knee cap at the age of 14. My other knee also became tight.I purchased this DVD with the idea that if my knee did not get better, or got worse, I would go for PT. For the first month I made great progress using this DVD and reduced time on the elliptical trainer. But then while on a Staycation my knee pain increased significantly. Different shoes, more active, etc. So, I went to the doctor. I have two subluxated patellas, the left one being significantly off the track. On top of that I have hip dysplasia  on the right (shallow hip socket), and a SIJ rotation - these were diagnosed initially in 1997.  So, I'm a fairly complex case!But throughout the 2 weeks for diagnostics, and additional 2 weeks to finally get into PT (and now I'm waiting another 3 weeks to get to the start of the regular weekly sessions) - I have continued to use this DVD. I truly think without it, I would not be walking.I have only had my first PT session, but what I've done so far is simply building on this DVD.  Concentrating on the gluteus medius, I've added resistance and reps for the clam shell, and holding time and reps for the side leg raises. I've increased the balancing exercises to add additional reps (which has also helped strengthen weak ankles, and a weak arch on my left foot).  And I can't do regular bridges, so now I'm learning to do the single leg bridge on a chair.  I've only had one week of PT, and I've already seen big results, but I've continued to use the exercises and stretches from this DVD as the basis for my work - only changing the exercises to meet my personal needs.I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone with knee injuries. And also, the stretching routine on the DVD is awesome.UPDATE December 2009:I am still in PT for my knee. Progress is being made but is slow, which is not unusual for the knee.  The only portion I still use from the DVD is the stretching sequence and I use it almost daily.  Even though I no longer use the DVD, the exercises I do continue to be based on the same ideas as this DVD, but either the rep count, the hold time, or intensity has been changed.  Besides the items mentioned above, the latest change has been to add weight to the wall slide exercises and maintain a 6-second hold time.  I have to be careful with exercises that target the quads directly as it causes the knee to lock down, but this one seems to be working.As another reviewer mentioned, I also added ankle weights to the side leg raises, although I had to place them just above the knees. It was amazing how important the gluteus medius exercises were for my recovery. In my modified versions it takes me about 30-35 minutes to do all of my lower body strength exercises, of which 15 minutes is for the gluteus medius!! It's amazing how things all fit together.As one of the other reviewers mentioned, this is a good DVD for beginners and even light intermediate.  But over time you will likely need to up the workout a little. Either way, I think this is a very good DVD.I never did use the 7 minute workout as I felt it was too rushed.",5,Covers all the bases,1255651200,"10 16, 2009",2009,3539,"['hurt', 'knee', 'end', 'July', 'very', 'quick', 'increase', 'frequency', 'duration', 'intensity', 'workouts', 'elliptical', 'trainer', 'had', 'been', 'pretty', 'lazy', 'past', 'year', 'was', 'point', 'was', 'only', 'using', 'weekends', 'then', 'went', 'quite', 'suddenly', '6', 'days', 'week', 'point', 'grinding', 'noise', 'had', 'previously', 'ignored', 'turned', 'mix', 'dull', 'pain', 'knee', 'cap', 'very', 'very', 'sharp', 'pain', 'left', 'knee', 'cap', 'had', 'dislocated', 'knee', 'cap', 'age', '14', 'other', 'knee', 'also', 'became', 'tight.I', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'idea', 'knee', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'got', 'worse', 'would', 'go', 'PT', 'first', 'month', 'made', 'great', 'progress', 'using', 'DVD', 'reduced', 'time', 'elliptical', 'trainer', 'then', 'Staycation', 'knee', 'pain', 'increased', 'significantly', 'Different', 'shoes', 'more', 'active', 'etc', 'So', 'went', 'doctor', 'have', 'two', 'subluxated', 'patellas', 'left', 'one', 'being', 'significantly', 'track', 'top', 'have', 'hip', 'dysplasia', 'right', 'shallow', 'hip', 'socket', 'SIJ', 'rotation', 'were', 'diagnosed', 'initially', '1997', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'complex', 'case', '2', 'weeks', 'diagnostics', 'additional', '2', 'weeks', 'finally', 'get', 'PT', 'now', ""'m"", 'waiting', '3', 'weeks', 'get', 'start', 'regular', 'weekly', 'sessions', 'have', 'continued', 'use', 'DVD', 'truly', 'think', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'walking.I', 'have', 'only', 'had', 'first', 'PT', 'session', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'so', 'far', 'simply', 'building', 'DVD', 'Concentrating', 'gluteus', 'medius', ""'ve"", 'added', 'resistance', 'reps', 'clam', 'shell', 'holding', 'time', 'reps', 'side', 'leg', ""'ve"", 'increased', 'balancing', 'add', 'additional', 'reps', 'also', 'helped', 'strengthen', 'weak', 'ankles', 'weak', 'arch', 'left', 'foot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'regular', 'bridges', 'so', 'now', ""'m"", 'learning', 'do', 'single', 'leg', 'bridge', 'chair', ""'ve"", 'only', 'had', 'one', 'week', 'PT', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'big', 'results', ""'ve"", 'continued', 'use', 'exercises', 'stretches', 'DVD', 'basis', 'work', 'only', 'changing', 'exercises', 'meet', 'personal', 'needs.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'knee', 'injuries', 'also', 'stretching', 'routine', 'DVD', 'awesome.UPDATE', 'December', '2009', 'am', 'still', 'PT', 'knee', 'Progress', 'being', 'made', 'slow', 'not', 'unusual', 'knee', 'only', 'portion', 'still', 'use', 'DVD', 'stretching', 'sequence', 'use', 'almost', 'daily', 'Even', 'no', 'longer', 'use', 'DVD', 'exercises', 'do', 'continue', 'be', 'based', 'same', 'ideas', 'DVD', 'rep', 'count', 'hold', 'time', 'intensity', 'been', 'changed', 'items', 'mentioned', 'latest', 'change', 'been', 'add', 'weight', 'wall', 'slide', 'exercises', 'maintain', '6-second', 'hold', 'time', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'exercises', 'target', 'quads', 'directly', 'knee', 'lock', 'down', 'one', 'be', 'working.As', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'also', 'added', 'ankle', 'weights', 'side', 'leg', 'had', 'place', 'just', 'knees', 'was', 'amazing', 'how', 'important', 'gluteus', 'medius', 'exercises', 'were', 'recovery', 'modified', 'versions', '30-35', 'minutes', 'do', 'lower', 'body', 'strength', '15', 'minutes', 'gluteus', 'medius', 'amazing', 'how', 'things', 'fit', 'together.As', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'good', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'even', 'light', 'intermediate', 'time', 'will', 'likely', 'need', 'up', 'workout', 'little', 'way', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'DVD.I', 'never', 'did', 'use', '7', 'minute', 'workout', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'rushed']",Strong Knees

1178409,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B001D261TS,Leanne,"[20, 20]","Last year, I was diagnosed with tendonitis and patellofemoral tracking syndrome in my right knee.  My orthopedist referred me to a physical therapist, who had me start on a regimen of both stretching and strengthening exercises.  When I first had these problems, my knee pain was so terrible that I couldn't even walk without feeling excruciating pain.What I have noticed is that when I do the exercises that my PT gave me, my knee pain recedes and both of my knees feel good.  What I have also discovered, however, is that I get lazy about doing the exercises on my own.  Finding this DVD was a treasure since it contains all of the exercises that my PT gave to me, and contains a thorough explanation of why these stretches and strengthening exercises are important.Chantal Donnelly makes this program fun to do; she has a pleasant voice and personality, and makes it enjoyable and bearable to do the exercises.  She recommends doing the exercises every other day.The filming of this video is also quite lovely.  It's set in this beautiful house, with dark wood floors and beautiful brick walls.  While that may not seem important to some, I think it's nice to have a pleasant backdrop since it makes me more likely to do the workout.While the main workout clocks in at about 35 minutes, you also have the option of customizing the workout so that you can mix and match those segments that interest you.  There are also several nice bonus features:  a seven-minute stretch that I plan on using after my cardio workouts, an IT band stretching segment, and a balance section.After using this video just one time, I, like other reviewers, can already tell a difference.  My knee pain has been flaring up the last couple of days, but doing this video just one time has made the pain go away.I also want to address the commercials that one reviewer commented on.  Yes, there are a few at the start of the DVD, but you can use your skip-ahead arrows on your DVD player to jump right past them. There is one short one that you can't skip, but it's maybe 15 seconds long.  All in all, it's not even a slight nuisance for me.If you have any kind of knee pain, give this video a try!

1178412,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B001D261TS,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","I am a runner and have one knee that is problematic. I've had surgery on it once, and while the surgery helped in some ways, in other ways the knee has never been the same. I have been through physical therapy after my surgery and am back to running more than ever before but not without occasional knee popping and pain. With that in mind I started doing more stretching and exercises to strengthen my knees. Although the results aren't perfect, there is improvement from the strategy.I had previously been exposed to some of the exercises that Chantal Donnelly demonstrates in this video, but this is one of the best overall presentations on knee-related exercises I have seen. The exercises and the anatomy behind them are quite well explained. While I generally found the strength exercises easy, some of the stretches were substantially more challenging, and I have adopted them with a great vigor. The presentation stresses holding each stretch for 30 seconds, and that's a noble goal, though not everyone will be able to do that with all stretches at first, which is fine. Practice makes perfect. I liked that there were easy and advanced versions of the different exercises and stretches presented, and the nature of the program allows for mixing and matching exercises and stretches to suit individual needs. I don't have IT band issues, for instance, so I tend to emphasize other things, but someone with IT band problems will find gold elsewhere within this DVD.My biggest objection to this DVD is the insulting length of unskippable ads at the beginning of the presentation for Gaiam branded items. Was it not enough that I bought the DVD? Now I have to be assaulted with advertisements for things I don't want to get to the exercises? Apparently so. The issue here is that after two views I'm sure there are nuances I haven't learned from the DVD yet, but I am wholly unwilling to sit through the ads again to get to the presentation. I think the instructor does a good job with her presentation, but I won't buy any more Gaiam products in the future as I don't want an omnipresent hard sell every time I start the DVD over.If you are willing to sit through the lengthy and annoying advertisements at the beginning of this DVD, Chantal Donnelly and the material she presents are good and will benefit your knees.",3,Good Exercises And Challenging Stretches After The Insufferable Advertisements,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,2325,"['am', 'runner', 'have', 'one', 'knee', 'problematic', ""'ve"", 'had', 'surgery', 'once', 'surgery', 'helped', 'ways', 'other', 'ways', 'knee', 'never', 'been', 'same', 'have', 'been', 'physical', 'therapy', 'surgery', 'am', 'back', 'running', 'more', 'ever', 'not', 'occasional', 'knee', 'popping', 'pain', 'mind', 'started', 'doing', 'more', 'stretching', 'strengthen', 'knees', 'results', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'improvement', 'strategy.I', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'exposed', 'exercises', 'Chantal', 'Donnelly', 'video', 'one', 'best', 'overall', 'presentations', 'knee-related', 'exercises', 'have', 'seen', 'exercises', 'anatomy', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'explained', 'generally', 'found', 'strength', 'easy', 'stretches', 'were', 'substantially', 'more', 'challenging', 'have', 'adopted', 'great', 'vigor', 'presentation', 'holding', 'stretch', '30', 'seconds', 'noble', 'goal', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'stretches', 'first', 'fine', 'Practice', 'perfect', 'liked', 'were', 'easy', 'advanced', 'versions', 'different', 'exercises', 'stretches', 'presented', 'nature', 'program', 'mixing', 'matching', 'exercises', 'stretches', 'suit', 'individual', 'needs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'IT', 'band', 'issues', 'instance', 'tend', 'emphasize', 'other', 'things', 'someone', 'IT', 'band', 'problems', 'will', 'find', 'gold', 'elsewhere', 'DVD.My', 'biggest', 'objection', 'DVD', 'insulting', 'length', 'unskippable', 'ads', 'beginning', 'presentation', 'Gaiam', 'branded', 'items', 'Was', 'not', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Now', 'have', 'be', 'assaulted', 'advertisements', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'exercises', 'Apparently', 'so', 'issue', 'here', 'two', 'views', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'nuances', 'have', ""n't"", 'learned', 'DVD', 'yet', 'am', 'wholly', 'unwilling', 'sit', 'ads', 'again', 'get', 'presentation', 'think', 'instructor', 'good', 'job', 'presentation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'more', 'Gaiam', 'products', 'future', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'omnipresent', 'hard', 'sell', 'time', 'start', 'DVD', 'over.If', 'are', 'willing', 'sit', 'lengthy', 'annoying', 'advertisements', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'Chantal', 'Donnelly', 'material', 'presents', 'are', 'good', 'will', 'benefit', 'knees']",Strong Knees

1178414,A2OG83SEU9HL6D,B001D261TS,"Shannon B Davis ""Nepenthe""","[230, 232]","Strong Knees turned out to be more of an informational video than an exercise video.  Yes, it contained strengthening and stretching exercises, but much of the video was instructional.  Apparently it is part of Gaiam's Body Insight series.Each muscular group that supports the knees was described, and how weakness in those areas could cause different types of knee pain.  Then, for each group, one beginner and one advanced exercise were performed.  There were not enough repetitions for true strength-training and stronger people may need to add weights.  However, I believe the purpose of the video was to learn the exercises and then put them into your own exercise routine, not to use this video as an exercise program.  I did learn a lot, however, even as an experienced exerciser and dancer.  I did not know that the calves, hip adductors and gluteus muscles could impact the knees, always focusing in the past on quads and hamstrings.  I also learned about alignment during exercises that really made them far more effective.Some of the exercises were new to me. Others were familiar from my previous experience with boxing training and from dancing (particularly ballet).  So, I will be adding these exercises to my daily practice, either as part of dance practice, or in front of the TV as many of them are compatible with sitting in front of the TV (and don't we all do that sometimes?)Next, the stretching routine stretched each one of the muscles and explained how tightness in those muscles could also lead to knee pain.  This section felt great.  I was happy that many of the stretches that are part of my current yoga practice are good for my knees.  There is no need to do this special stretch series for me.The instructor was very intelligent, well-spoken and made sure to cue proper alignment at all times.The DVD also contains a 7 minute abbreviated workout and a section on IT band massage.My major problem with the video was the two minutes of required commercials.  I will not do this video again - when I have time to work out, I do not want to spend 2 minutes waiting through commercials.  I don't mind commercials on a DVD but if I do it multiple times, I want to be able to skip them.  Unfortunately, this ""feature"" has become all too common on mass-market fitness DVDs.  Can you imagine if you wanted to do the quick 7 minute workout on this DVD and had to sit through that many commercials?  That is the reason I am degrading the star rating on this product and I hope that Gaiam will sit up and take notice that consumers do not appreciate the commercials.  After all, we just spent 20$ on a DVD, why should we have to watch commercials?  Advertisement for other DVDs should be an optional experience, or one that is included in the paper insert for the product.",3,"excellent information, but too many commercials",1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,2792,"['Strong', 'Knees', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'informational', 'video', 'exercise', 'video', 'Yes', 'contained', 'strengthening', 'stretching', 'exercises', 'much', 'video', 'was', 'instructional', 'Apparently', 'part', 'Gaiam', 'Body', 'Insight', 'series.Each', 'muscular', 'group', 'knees', 'was', 'described', 'how', 'weakness', 'areas', 'could', 'cause', 'different', 'types', 'knee', 'pain', 'Then', 'group', 'one', 'beginner', 'one', 'advanced', 'exercise', 'were', 'performed', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'repetitions', 'true', 'strength-training', 'stronger', 'people', 'may', 'need', 'add', 'weights', 'However', 'believe', 'purpose', 'video', 'was', 'learn', 'exercises', 'then', 'put', 'own', 'exercise', 'routine', 'not', 'use', 'video', 'exercise', 'program', 'did', 'learn', 'lot', 'however', 'even', 'experienced', 'exerciser', 'dancer', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'calves', 'hip', 'adductors', 'gluteus', 'muscles', 'could', 'impact', 'knees', 'always', 'focusing', 'past', 'quads', 'hamstrings', 'also', 'learned', 'alignment', 'exercises', 'really', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'effective.Some', 'exercises', 'were', 'new', 'Others', 'were', 'familiar', 'previous', 'experience', 'boxing', 'training', 'dancing', 'particularly', 'ballet', 'So', 'will', 'be', 'adding', 'exercises', 'daily', 'practice', 'part', 'dance', 'practice', 'front', 'TV', 'many', 'are', 'compatible', 'sitting', 'front', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'sometimes', 'Next', 'stretching', 'routine', 'stretched', 'one', 'muscles', 'explained', 'how', 'tightness', 'muscles', 'could', 'also', 'lead', 'knee', 'pain', 'section', 'felt', 'great', 'was', 'happy', 'many', 'stretches', 'are', 'part', 'current', 'yoga', 'practice', 'are', 'good', 'knees', 'need', 'do', 'special', 'stretch', 'series', 'me.The', 'instructor', 'was', 'very', 'intelligent', 'well-spoken', 'made', 'sure', 'cue', 'proper', 'alignment', 'times.The', 'DVD', 'also', '7', 'minute', 'abbreviated', 'workout', 'section', 'IT', 'band', 'massage.My', 'major', 'problem', 'video', 'was', 'two', 'minutes', 'required', 'commercials', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'video', 'again', 'when', 'have', 'time', 'work', 'out', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spend', '2', 'minutes', 'waiting', 'commercials', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'commercials', 'DVD', 'do', 'multiple', 'times', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'skip', 'Unfortunately', 'feature', 'become', 'too', 'common', 'mass-market', 'fitness', 'DVDs', 'Can', 'imagine', 'wanted', 'do', 'quick', '7', 'minute', 'workout', 'DVD', 'had', 'sit', 'many', 'commercials', 'reason', 'am', 'degrading', 'star', 'rating', 'product', 'hope', 'Gaiam', 'will', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'consumers', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate', 'commercials', 'just', 'spent', '20', 'DVD', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'watch', 'commercials', 'Advertisement', 'other', 'DVDs', 'should', 'be', 'optional', 'experience', 'one', 'included', 'paper', 'insert', 'product']",Strong Knees
1178415,A14UEQJ2YA07HA,B001D261TS,smashbox24cr,"[1, 1]","When I was in high school I ran track and had some alignment issues. I suspected something was amiss, but my track coach shrugged and said to ""run through the pain"". Anyway, I suspect that certain muscle groups in my legs were stronger than others, although i'm not sure why - maybe not doing the right stretches, or focusing too much on repetitive workouts that use the same exercises.Anyhow, that was years ago, and I thought I'd try this DVD.Pros: It is fairly slow paced and is not extremely intense.I like that because I can mix in it with other DVDs when I want a very light workout that is also helping me to achieve balanced muscle groups.This is also a good one to start with if you've had to take a break from exercise for some reason and are not in the same good shape you usually are in.On the DVD, C.D. actually shows diagrams of the Muscle groups which correlate with knee problems and does a very professional job of explaining how each group affects alignment. She allows for skipping stretches that may cause you pain and encourages you to return to them later once you have strengthened the muscle group by doing easier excercises on the DVD.The best word for this DVD might be : gentle.As an active 30-something, I won't say it was a tremendous workout. However, it did leavea small burn and I feel a pleasantly sore sensation in each of the muscle groups I worked out. I did the video with three friends who also gave this feedback.I really liked the fact that on the DVD menu, you can mix and match the order of the exercises.Cons:One thing I disliked about the video was that when you needed to use a Prop, it suddenly appeared on the screen without giving the viewer time to go get the Prop (chair; towel; and stretching band). However, we just paused it. I shouldnt think of this as a dealbreaker if I were considering buying this video.One other thing was that my friends and I did not have stretching bands, so we simply took a towel, folded it lenthwise in half, and used it for the exercises shown in the video. It worked well for us.The title is good and forthright, although I wonder if in small letters you might want to put ""Lower Body Stretches for"" above the bold large ""Strong Knees"" lettering.I enjoyed this video and would recommend it to anyone who is slightly out of shape or has some slight alignment issues.  If you have serious pain, however it's probably best to consult a doctor.  I have had physical therapy for a pulled ligament in my foot in the past and that type of thing really requires a professional.  I do remember that she recommended me to do the IT band stretching with a foam roller (which really hurts by the way - it is very uncomfortable at best), and I think that if this video can get me to a more flexible place without the foam roller, I'm cool with that.  I haven't needed to use a F.R. in awhile, but it probably wouldn't hurt to start that up again either, since it's good for you to not have your IT be too tight.",4,Lower Body Stretching for Strong Knees,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,2981,"['When', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'ran', 'track', 'had', 'alignment', 'issues', 'suspected', 'something', 'was', 'amiss', 'track', 'coach', 'shrugged', 'said', 'run', 'pain', 'Anyway', 'suspect', 'certain', 'muscle', 'groups', 'legs', 'were', 'stronger', 'others', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'maybe', 'not', 'doing', 'right', 'stretches', 'focusing', 'too', 'much', 'repetitive', 'workouts', 'use', 'same', 'exercises.Anyhow', 'was', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'DVD.Pros', 'fairly', 'slow', 'paced', 'not', 'extremely', 'intense.I', 'can', 'mix', 'other', 'DVDs', 'when', 'want', 'very', 'light', 'workout', 'also', 'helping', 'achieve', 'balanced', 'muscle', 'groups.This', 'also', 'good', 'one', 'start', ""'ve"", 'had', 'take', 'break', 'exercise', 'reason', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'good', 'shape', 'usually', 'are', 'in.On', 'DVD', 'C.D', 'actually', 'diagrams', 'Muscle', 'groups', 'correlate', 'knee', 'problems', 'very', 'professional', 'job', 'explaining', 'how', 'group', 'alignment', 'skipping', 'stretches', 'may', 'cause', 'pain', 'return', 'later', 'once', 'have', 'strengthened', 'muscle', 'group', 'doing', 'easier', 'excercises', 'DVD.The', 'best', 'word', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'gentle.As', 'active', '30-something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'tremendous', 'workout', 'However', 'did', 'leavea', 'small', 'burn', 'feel', 'pleasantly', 'sore', 'sensation', 'muscle', 'groups', 'worked', 'out', 'did', 'video', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'also', 'gave', 'feedback.I', 'really', 'liked', 'fact', 'DVD', 'menu', 'can', 'mix', 'match', 'order', 'exercises.Cons', 'One', 'thing', 'disliked', 'video', 'was', 'when', 'needed', 'use', 'Prop', 'suddenly', 'appeared', 'screen', 'giving', 'viewer', 'time', 'go', 'get', 'Prop', 'chair', 'towel', 'stretching', 'band', 'However', 'just', 'paused', 'shouldnt', 'think', 'dealbreaker', 'were', 'considering', 'buying', 'video.One', 'other', 'thing', 'was', 'friends', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'stretching', 'bands', 'simply', 'took', 'towel', 'folded', 'lenthwise', 'half', 'used', 'exercises', 'shown', 'video', 'worked', 'well', 'us.The', 'title', 'good', 'forthright', 'wonder', 'small', 'letters', 'might', 'want', 'put', 'Lower', 'Body', 'Stretches', 'bold', 'large', 'Strong', 'Knees', 'lettering.I', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'slightly', 'shape', 'slight', 'alignment', 'issues', 'have', 'serious', 'pain', 'however', 'probably', 'best', 'consult', 'doctor', 'have', 'had', 'physical', 'therapy', 'pulled', 'ligament', 'foot', 'past', 'type', 'thing', 'really', 'professional', 'do', 'remember', 'recommended', 'do', 'IT', 'band', 'stretching', 'foam', 'roller', 'really', 'way', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'best', 'think', 'video', 'can', 'get', 'more', 'flexible', 'place', 'foam', 'roller', ""'m"", 'cool', 'have', ""n't"", 'needed', 'use', 'F.R', 'awhile', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'start', 'up', 'again', 'either', 'good', 'not', 'have', 'IT', 'be', 'too', 'tight']",Strong Knees
1178416,A2U9XJLVW3HLYA,B001D261TS,S. Sied,"[14, 14]","This workout dvd provides a wealth of information about common causes of knee pain and how to relieve or prevent knee pain. It is also beautifully produced and effective.I agree with other posters in that there are too many commercials for other dvds at the start of the program. I found this easy to deal with as I just pushed the next ""chapter button"" until the menu appeared (I think I have to press the button 3 or 4 times). Some mentioned the dvd is very wordy and it can be a little tedious to listen to the information every time one works out. I didn't find this to be the case as I only listened to the entire dvd the first time I followed it. Otherwise I go to the Bonus section and choose the ""Create your own workout"" option. This allows you to do the exercises and stretches with less discussion. I found the exercises to be well cued and well demonstrated. I found in my case, my knees immediately feel better while doing the stretching program so I am planning to incorporate those stretches into my regular routine.I did find the overall workout a little easy for me. It is a great workout for beginners and I believe it may be accessible for those who need a gentle workout due to injuries. Given the intention of this workout, I think it is paced appropriately. Since my knee issues are minor and seem to be caused by tightness (hence why the stretching helps), I decided to try some of the exercises with adjustable ankle weights. This seemed to be a good strengthening level for me. I found some exercises very challenging such as those that target the abductors and glut. medius.

I feel when you pay for a DVD program, you should not be subjected to advertising.The first part of the program discusses the knees, how they're built and how they work, what can go wrong and how you can deal with pain and even avoid or prevent it.It's good to watch this section at least one time before you begin working on your knees.But then it goes right into the 30-minute exercise program without giving you the option to break up your exercises into the 7 minute sections. She does say that you have that option but I didn't see it.There are exercises for beginners, intermediates and advanced exercises. Even though the program is produced by Gaiam, it is not what I'd call yoga but rather stretching, strengthening exercises. A few of the exercises, however, are yoga poses.Chantal Donnelly, the instructor, first describes the exercises and the modifications. You'll hear soft, pleasant music that won't overpower. The room where they're exercising is a clean, minimalist room and the colors good and comforting.She tells you that you can design your own exercise program based on your needs and the time available.You'll want a soft or semi-firm (not firm) pillow, towel or bolster and a sturdy straight-backed chair and, of course, a mat. You'll also want a dyna band or a strap. A band would probably be best.Chantal gives good instructions and directions. She has a pleasant personality and a nice, pleasing voice. I was impressed with what she brings to the video and the exercises.The exercises are frequently interrupted with instructions and information. This could, after a while, become annoying. In the first view, it's a good thing. As one reviewer says, have your remote handy.The main program lasts over 35 minutes, rather than the thirty.You have to click on the Bonus Features to get to the 7 minute and Design Your Own Program areas.All of these exercises will indeed strengthen your knees and help you eliminate pain.
