1602400,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B009UHGW7Y,Doug Erlandson,"[4, 4]","Matthew Rhys does an excellent job of playing a wealthy executive named John and a recently unemployed schoolteacher who happen to meet one night in a British pub and discover that they look almost alike. The executive, who lives in a British mansion with his wife, his married brother and his wife, his unmarried sister, and his drug-addicted mother and her caretaker, has recently failed to obtain a contract that will keep their foundry open. When he meets his doppelg&auml;nger, he gets him drunk, takes his clothes, and disappears. Meanwhile, the former schoolteacher is picked up by the chauffeur, who has no idea that he is not the owner of the foundry. Neither does anyone else in the family. They simply assume he is John. The new &#34;John&#34; discovers that he must negotiate some rather complex family dynamics, which have come about because the John who has disappeared has had affairs with his brother's wife and the former female lover of his sister. In effect, &#34;John&#34; the schoolteacher must take upon himself the sins that the original John has inflicted on his family.This movie was far better than I first expected. Although it began rather slowly, it soon picked up and I found myself engrossed in the plot. While in some ways it is a bit farfetched (though not extremely so), it is also eminently believable.For the American viewer I would suggest using subtitles. Some of the British English is a bit hard to understand, particularly at the start.",5,"Excellent, poignant story",1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,1477,"['Matthew', 'Rhys', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'wealthy', 'executive', 'named', 'John', 'recently', 'unemployed', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'happen', 'meet', 'one', 'night', 'British', 'pub', 'discover', 'look', 'almost', 'alike', 'executive', 'who', 'British', 'mansion', 'wife', 'married', 'brother', 'wife', 'unmarried', 'sister', 'drug-addicted', 'mother', 'caretaker', 'recently', 'failed', 'obtain', 'contract', 'will', 'keep', 'foundry', 'open', 'When', 'doppelg', 'auml', 'drunk', 'clothes', 'disappears', 'Meanwhile', 'former', 'schoolteacher', 'picked', 'up', 'chauffeur', 'who', 'idea', 'not', 'owner', 'foundry', 'anyone', 'else', 'family', 'simply', 'assume', 'John', 'new', '34', 'John', '34', 'discovers', 'must', 'negotiate', 'rather', 'complex', 'family', 'dynamics', 'have', 'come', 'John', 'who', 'disappeared', 'had', 'affairs', 'brother', 'wife', 'former', 'female', 'lover', 'sister', 'effect', '34', 'John', '34', 'schoolteacher', 'must', 'take', 'sins', 'original', 'John', 'inflicted', 'family.This', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'first', 'expected', 'began', 'rather', 'slowly', 'soon', 'picked', 'found', 'engrossed', 'plot', 'ways', 'bit', 'farfetched', 'not', 'extremely', 'so', 'also', 'eminently', 'American', 'viewer', 'would', 'suggest', 'using', 'subtitles', 'British', 'English', 'bit', 'hard', 'understand', 'particularly', 'start']","The Scapegoat The Scape goat  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

1602402,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009UHGW7Y,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 12]","I really went into the film ""The Scapegoat"" with moderate expectations.  Having never heard of this version of the Daphne Du Maurier novel, I thought I'd take a chance and maybe have some fun.  But I didn't anticipate that I would absolutely LOVE the movie and I did!  I had seen the 1959 British melodrama version of ""The Scapegoat"" with Alec Guinness and Bette Davis, so I already knew the primary plot points of this rather far-fetched story.  But within minutes, I had given myself over to this new interpretation.  What works so well, I think, is that the screenplay does an excellent job of balancing the disparate tones of the piece.  Funny, mysterious, romantic, dangerous, and even poignant--every time the picture shifted in emotion or mood, I willingly followed with it.  And as improbable as the plotting can be, I surrendered myself to the experience for the sheer love of movies!  Lush and well acted, I really think that ""The Scapegoat"" is a movie destined to be discovered and appreciated by a wider audience.  While the beginning genuinely amused me, the power and resonance of the piece snuck up and surprised me.  For my taste, I think it does an even better job than the previous version of immersing you in the mysterious and tantalizing world that the audience unravels at the same time as the protagonist.Matthew Rhys plays John, a recently unemployed teacher trying to determine the next steps in his life.  Matthew Rhys also plays Johnny, a ne'er-do-well aristocrat with a talent for disappointing his family.  The two meet fortuitously as both are traveling, and the wealthy young man decides to co-opt his new friend's identity.  Unable to make much sense of what is transpiring, the impoverished John is whisked away to a life of luxury and complication.  I don't want to reveal too much, but circumstances have him start to play the role of the black sheep son and husband.  With the family at the brink of crisis, they may have found an unwitting savior that they think is their own version of Johnny.  As I mentioned, I laughed quite frequently during this set-up of ""The Scapegoat"" due to the outlandishness of it all, but I was soon entranced in the mystery as I tried to figure out what was going on right along with Rhys.  Then as he makes genuine connections with the family, the film takes on a surprising amount of tenderness and hope.  In many ways, this is a feel good story.  But when everything is built on a lie, isn't it only a matter of time before the facade starts to crumble?Playing dual parts, Rhys has a role that really showcases his acting chops.  Having followed his career for a number of years, I think this is a must-see for his fans and one of his most fully formed performances.  But this is really an impressive cast all around.  Eileen Atkins (I'd watch her in anything) as the detached matriarch, Andrew Scott (Moriarty on the new BBC Sherlock) as the undervalued brother, and Jodhi May as the fragile wife are all notable standouts, but everyone is doing great work here.  The period detail, the sets, and the cinematography are also impeccable.  I'm not really sure why this didn't arrive with more fanfare.  Director Charles Sturridge has certainly had an impressive career in television and film.  He understand this class division as well as anyone.  As far back as 1981, he directed the impeccable miniseries adaptation of ""Brideshead Revisited!""  ""The Scapegoat"" is no stuffy chamber piece, though, it is full of life.  I'm not usually one to rave, but this came as a complete surprise!
