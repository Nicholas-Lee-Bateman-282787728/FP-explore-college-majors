Mist (Mel Giedroyc), a Border Collie, is born on a New Zealand sheep farm, the granddaughter of the expert sheepdog Sir Gregory (Brian Blessed) by way of his daughter Swift (Gillian Hanna).  Her grandfather is certain she has what it takes to carry on the family name, and she wants very much to affirm his faith, but learning to be a sheepdog isn't as easy as it looks.  Mist must not only master her trade but cope with the rest of her pack, including the zany Ernie (David McNeill) and the cynical Fern (Una Stubbs), and, in the end, overcome her own self-doubts to rescue the cragfast ram MacPherson (Clive Russell), who, sheeplike, is by no means a willing accomplice.  The voice talents are nicely matched to the characters, the mouth movements well fitted to the dialogue, and despite its four-legged cast, this is actually a universal story about growing up and all it entails, and as such is something every kid should see.",4,A sweet little dog-tale,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,1072,"['Lovers', 'ofBabe', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'andCharlotte', 'Web', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'should', 'find', 'little-known', 'movie', 'just', 'taste', 'Mist', 'Mel', 'Giedroyc', 'Border', 'Collie', 'born', 'New', 'Zealand', 'sheep', 'farm', 'granddaughter', 'expert', 'sheepdog', 'Sir', 'Gregory', 'Brian', 'Blessed', 'way', 'daughter', 'Swift', 'Gillian', 'Hanna', 'grandfather', 'certain', 'what', 'carry', 'family', 'name', 'very', 'much', 'affirm', 'faith', 'learning', 'be', 'sheepdog', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'Mist', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'master', 'trade', 'cope', 'rest', 'pack', 'including', 'zany', 'Ernie', 'David', 'McNeill', 'cynical', 'Fern', 'Una', 'Stubbs', 'end', 'overcome', 'own', 'self-doubts', 'rescue', 'cragfast', 'ram', 'MacPherson', 'Clive', 'Russell', 'who', 'sheeplike', 'willing', 'accomplice', 'voice', 'talents', 'are', 'nicely', 'matched', 'characters', 'mouth', 'movements', 'well', 'fitted', 'dialogue', 'four-legged', 'cast', 'actually', 'universal', 'story', 'growing', 'up', 'such', 'something', 'kid', 'should', 'see']",Mist: The Tale of a Sheepdog Puppy

But this movie seems more like hours worth of home video footage spliced together with HORRIBLE voice acting and narration put on top of it. The people that voiced theses characters are among the worst I have ever heard. Some of the accents these people came up with were just terrible. It would be much more enjoyable watching this movie on MUTE! But even then it's not very good. The camera work is very amateurish. The picture is often out of focus and they don't even do a good job at keeping the dogs on screen all the time.This movie is good for ages 2 and under. For everybody else, watch a better movie or buy a dog calendar.",1,About put me in a coma,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,770,"['DVD', 'cover', 'sold', 'movie', 'love', 'puppies', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'animal', 'movies', 'One', 'best', 'being', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'movie', 'more', 'hours', 'home', 'video', 'footage', 'spliced', 'together', 'HORRIBLE', 'voice', 'acting', 'narration', 'put', 'top', 'people', 'voiced', 'theses', 'characters', 'are', 'worst', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'accents', 'people', 'came', 'up', 'were', 'just', 'terrible', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'movie', 'MUTE', 'even', 'then', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'very', 'amateurish', 'picture', 'often', 'focus', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'dogs', 'screen', 'time.This', 'movie', 'good', 'ages', '2', 'everybody', 'else', 'watch', 'better', 'movie', 'buy', 'dog', 'calendar']",Mist: The Tale of a Sheepdog Puppy

Just enough conflict to keep it interesting, but no violence, no crude language, no cartoon characters, none of the double entendres you don't want to have to explain to children.Mist is a sheepdog puppy who grows up in this film and learns the rules of being a good sheepdog.  She exemplifies the power of focus, courage, and attention, and gently teaches those lessons. Added to this is a setting that will calm your spirit, and photography that shimmers.Mist gently lifts your spirit.

1140502,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B0013D8L6S,The Jaundiced Eye,"[23, 23]","I watched this movie because I love animals and wanted a break from the violence and gore of most recent releases. It is an oasis of good, clean family entertainment in a market where such products are increasingly rare.The movie revolves around a border collie puppy born on a spectacularly beautiful sheep ranch near the ocean in the British Isles. As the puppy grows up, there is a question as to whether she can prove herself to be a talented sheep-herder and earn the right to stay with her family. An unusual, and rather old-fashioned, feature of this movie is that while the animal ""stars"" speak to each other in unique voices, there is no computer-assisted mouth movement or other modern CGI features generally associated with movies such as this. The actions (and accents) of the dogs, sheep, and ducks all fit who they are and what they are doing and saying, and the individual personalities of each animal become well developed. Kids will love this. Parents will too.The plot contains some suspense, danger, humor, and (warning) the inevitable tear-jerking moment when one of the dogs dies of old age (very nicely handled). The scenery is magnificent, as is the photography, and the script, while a wee bit juvenile, is still better than scripts found in many ""adult"" movies.If you have young children and want to do them (and yourself) a big favor, rent or buy this DVD. It is not as glossy as a Disney feature, but has an old-style beauty that simply glows. You will come to love Mist.",4,"A Wonderful ""Old-Fashioned"" Film for Kids of all Ages.......",1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1498,"['watched', 'movie', 'love', 'animals', 'wanted', 'break', 'violence', 'gore', 'most', 'recent', 'releases', 'oasis', 'good', 'clean', 'family', 'entertainment', 'market', 'where', 'such', 'products', 'are', 'increasingly', 'rare.The', 'movie', 'around', 'border', 'collie', 'puppy', 'born', 'spectacularly', 'beautiful', 'sheep', 'ranch', 'ocean', 'British', 'Isles', 'puppy', 'up', 'question', 'can', 'prove', 'be', 'talented', 'sheep-herder', 'earn', 'right', 'stay', 'family', 'unusual', 'rather', 'old-fashioned', 'feature', 'movie', 'animal', 'stars', 'speak', 'other', 'unique', 'voices', 'computer-assisted', 'mouth', 'movement', 'other', 'modern', 'CGI', 'features', 'generally', 'associated', 'movies', 'such', 'actions', 'accents', 'dogs', 'sheep', 'fit', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'saying', 'individual', 'personalities', 'animal', 'become', 'well', 'developed', 'Kids', 'will', 'love', 'Parents', 'will', 'too.The', 'plot', 'suspense', 'danger', 'humor', 'warning', 'inevitable', 'tear-jerking', 'moment', 'when', 'one', 'dogs', 'dies', 'old', 'age', 'very', 'nicely', 'handled', 'scenery', 'magnificent', 'photography', 'script', 'wee', 'bit', 'juvenile', 'still', 'better', 'scripts', 'found', 'many', 'adult', 'movies.If', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'want', 'do', 'big', 'favor', 'rent', 'buy', 'DVD', 'not', 'as', 'glossy', 'Disney', 'feature', 'old-style', 'beauty', 'simply', 'will', 'come', 'love', 'Mist']",Mist: The Tale of a Sheepdog Puppy
