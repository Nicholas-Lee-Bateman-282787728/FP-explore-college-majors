Here, Bill is entertaining, but is beginning to sound like a broken record. This DVD could have been recorded at any time in the last 6 years. Okay, I get it, you don't like Bush. But that's easy when you're in front of a blue state crowd--in this case, a Portland, OR, audience. Try your material in the South, Bill. It might not go over well, but it might be a challenge and make you a better comedian. I don't mind political humor one bit, but this is two-dimensional stand up. Bill gives us almost no insight into his personal life. What's his take on relationships and his upbringing? It seems Bill is hiding behind politics because he doesn't want to talk about himself. That's okay, but he could perhaps be doing some truly great material if he mined his own experiences. Sure, I like hearing about politics in comedy routines. Bill Hicks was good at it. But whereas Bill Hicks evoked belly laughs, Bill Maher, at least on this DVD, inspires only chuckles. And unlike Bill Hicks, Bill Maher doesn't seem truly angry on this DVD. He seems amused with Republican antics, maybe a bit annoyed, but not ANGRY!!! One suggestion, Bill: try not to laugh so often at your own jokes. It doesn't necesarily make you seem smug, but it does detract from the impact of your material. We're the ones who are supposed to be laughing. And, what was the deal with those blue pieces of paper on the stage floor? If they were markers, Bill didn't seem to need them. The performance was pretty polished. Maybe that's the problem, Bill seems to be going through the motions here. As political commentators go, Bill Maher is great. He's better on his talk shows, however, than he is doing stand up. On tv, he's great, on stage, he's pretty good.",3,"Bill, give us a bit more, okay?",1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,1836,"['wish', 'Bill', 'was', 'still', 'ABC', 'was', 'show', 'title', 'too', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'America', 'Here', 'Bill', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'sound', 'broken', 'record', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'time', 'last', '6', 'years', 'Okay', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Bush', 'easy', 'when', ""'re"", 'front', 'blue', 'state', 'crowd', 'case', 'Portland', 'OR', 'audience', 'Try', 'material', 'South', 'Bill', 'might', 'not', 'go', 'over', 'well', 'might', 'be', 'challenge', 'make', 'better', 'comedian', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'political', 'humor', 'one', 'bit', 'two-dimensional', 'stand', 'up', 'Bill', 'almost', 'insight', 'personal', 'life', 'What', 'take', 'relationships', 'upbringing', 'Bill', 'hiding', 'politics', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'okay', 'could', 'perhaps', 'be', 'doing', 'truly', 'great', 'material', 'mined', 'own', 'experiences', 'Sure', 'like', 'hearing', 'politics', 'comedy', 'routines', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'was', 'good', 'whereas', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'evoked', 'belly', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'least', 'DVD', 'only', 'chuckles', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'Bill', 'Maher', ""n't"", 'seem', 'truly', 'angry', 'DVD', 'amused', 'Republican', 'antics', 'maybe', 'bit', 'annoyed', 'not', 'ANGRY', 'One', 'suggestion', 'Bill', 'try', 'not', 'laugh', 'so', 'often', 'own', 'jokes', ""n't"", 'necesarily', 'make', 'seem', 'smug', 'detract', 'impact', 'material', ""'re"", 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'laughing', 'what', 'was', 'deal', 'blue', 'pieces', 'paper', 'stage', 'floor', 'were', 'markers', 'Bill', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'need', 'performance', 'was', 'pretty', 'polished', 'Maybe', 'problem', 'Bill', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'here', 'political', 'commentators', 'go', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'great', 'better', 'talk', 'shows', 'however', 'doing', 'stand', 'up', 'tv', 'great', 'stage', 'pretty', 'good']",N/A

He used to actually inspire me when it came to being brave enough to argue my own opinions without making apologies; but not anymore. My respect dissipated as his fairness was replaced by blinding hatred for GWB and religion.I watched ""I'm Swiss"" once and almost couldn't refrain from vomiting.He talks about the usual suspects: the president, religion, obesity, same-sex marriage, Rap, and few other things that ""comedians"" are good at joking about and liberals are good at preaching about. I know, I know, he's not a liberal, he's a libertarian. Well, I have watched and listened to Bill Maher and I know which side he's on most of the time, and it sure isn't on the right. He hates organized religion and traditional morality too much to be on the right much of the time. I don't know why his panties are in such a bunch. Being organized is better than being disorganized (I can tell jokes too). I'm not religious; and I can't help but see much of it as hard to swallow, but I'm not arrogant enough to call all of it just a bunch of fairytales created and believed by people with neurological disorders. I wasn't there when the Bible was written or when the events took place. I can't say it's all fairtyales. I can only say some of it isn't logical. But, I respect religion and its purposes; which is what separates me from him.He has no qualms about crushing the hope of people who believe in an afterlife or religion, which are both things that make life more bearable for them. The purpose of religion is to provide hope and solace and relief to people who are living in desperation. The same purpose of drugs I might add: something Maher not only defends but abuses. Why the double standard?  This is no longer the eleventh century where Protestants are killing Catholics. The only people k/illing in the name of religion are fanatical Muslims, but most religious people are good, decent, nonviolent individuals. Maher's not an atheist, but he has recently expressed a ""could be, could be not"" attitude toward the existence of a G/od, which would make him agnostic. But one thing is for sure, atheism has more blood on its hands than religion does. Two of our biggest mass murderers--Hitler and Stalin--were atheist.It's a shame when non comedians are actually funnier than Maher, who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be a good one. Most of the time, he can barely get the joke out without laughing at himself. I laughed twice during the entire show.No one has ever accused Maher of being modest. He's a smug, intellectual elitist. And those are his GOOD qualities. ""I'm Swiss"" displays this all too clearly. In case you didn't know, ""I'm Swiss"" is a running joke of Maher's embarrassment of being an American. He'd rather belong to a country where ethics are a substitution for, not an extension of, morality; where any depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all; where adultery is seen as cute, not sinful; where there are no fat people; where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions.Thank God I live in America and not Switzerland.",2,American cheese is better than Swiss.,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,3178,"['used', 'have', 'respect', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'used', 'actually', 'inspire', 'when', 'came', 'being', 'brave', 'enough', 'argue', 'own', 'opinions', 'making', 'apologies', 'not', 'anymore', 'respect', 'dissipated', 'fairness', 'was', 'replaced', 'blinding', 'hatred', 'GWB', 'religion.I', 'watched', ""'m"", 'Swiss', 'once', 'almost', 'could', ""n't"", 'refrain', 'vomiting.He', 'talks', 'usual', 'suspects', 'president', 'religion', 'obesity', 'same-sex', 'marriage', 'Rap', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'comedians', 'are', 'good', 'joking', 'about', 'liberals', 'are', 'good', 'preaching', 'know', 'know', 'not', 'liberal', 'libertarian', 'Well', 'have', 'watched', 'listened', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'know', 'side', 'most', 'time', 'sure', ""n't"", 'right', 'organized', 'religion', 'traditional', 'morality', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'right', 'much', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'panties', 'are', 'such', 'bunch', 'Being', 'organized', 'better', 'being', 'disorganized', 'can', 'tell', 'jokes', 'too', ""'m"", 'not', 'religious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', 'much', 'hard', 'swallow', ""'m"", 'not', 'arrogant', 'enough', 'call', 'just', 'bunch', 'fairytales', 'created', 'believed', 'people', 'neurological', 'disorders', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'when', 'Bible', 'was', 'written', 'when', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'fairtyales', 'can', 'only', 'say', ""n't"", 'logical', 'respect', 'religion', 'purposes', 'what', 'him.He', 'qualms', 'crushing', 'hope', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'afterlife', 'religion', 'are', 'things', 'make', 'life', 'more', 'bearable', 'purpose', 'religion', 'provide', 'hope', 'solace', 'relief', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'desperation', 'same', 'purpose', 'drugs', 'might', 'add', 'something', 'Maher', 'not', 'only', 'abuses', 'Why', 'double', 'standard', 'no', 'longer', 'eleventh', 'century', 'where', 'Protestants', 'are', 'killing', 'Catholics', 'only', 'people', 'k/illing', 'name', 'religion', 'are', 'fanatical', 'Muslims', 'most', 'religious', 'people', 'are', 'good', 'decent', 'nonviolent', 'individuals', 'Maher', 'not', 'atheist', 'recently', 'expressed', 'could', 'be', 'could', 'be', 'not', 'attitude', 'existence', 'G/od', 'would', 'make', 'agnostic', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'atheism', 'more', 'blood', 'hands', 'religion', 'Two', 'biggest', 'mass', 'murderers', 'Hitler', 'Stalin', 'were', 'atheist.It', 'shame', 'when', 'non', 'comedians', 'are', 'actually', 'funnier', 'Maher', 'who', 'comedian', 'label', 'too', 'bitter', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'Most', 'time', 'can', 'barely', 'get', 'joke', 'laughing', 'laughed', 'twice', 'entire', 'show.No', 'one', 'ever', 'accused', 'Maher', 'being', 'modest', 'smug', 'intellectual', 'elitist', 'are', 'GOOD', 'qualities', ""'m"", 'Swiss', 'displays', 'too', 'clearly', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'Swiss', 'running', 'joke', 'Maher', 'embarrassment', 'being', 'American', ""'d"", 'rather', 'belong', 'country', 'where', 'ethics', 'are', 'substitution', 'not', 'extension', 'morality', 'where', 'depraved', 'activity', 'victim', 'not', 'immoral', 'where', 'adultery', 'seen', 'cute', 'not', 'sinful', 'where', 'are', 'fat', 'people', 'where', 'only', 'women', 'who', 'exist', 'are', 'pretty', 'ones', 'can', 'sleep', 'ugly', 'ones', 'who', 'agree', 'opinions.Thank', 'God', 'live', 'America', 'not', 'Switzerland']",N/A

Holding a sign listing ""homosexuality,"" ""feminism"" and other reasons he thinks people go to hell, the demonstrator condemns ""liberals"" waiting in line to see Maher.  Loud and long-winded, this sole crackpot overwhelms the crowd, proving a symbol for America's version of Apartheid, the ignorant minority dominating the educated majority that culminated in the George W. Bush 2000s, and not that different from outnumbered whites controlling South Africa's black population all those years.While Bill Maher does not mention the loudmouth protestor in his I'M SWISS stand-up act, he addresses the lunatic fringe's control of the United States and purports to tell people he's from Switzerland, not America.  Bill Maher remains funny above all, and as I've seen comedians such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller forget their great senses of humor when broaching politics, I give Maher credit for keeping his eye on the ball.An I'M SWISS D.V.D. extra shows Bill Maher taking audience questions after the show.

929271,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000ANVQ5U,Robert Moore,"[66, 75]","Unlike many people who try to joke about politics, Bill Maher has the distinction of being extremely funny.  Even if you disagree with his opinions (as I do when he talks about religion--I happen to believe that religious not only is compatible with leftist thinking, but that the New Testament promotes it), he is very, very funny.  Anyone who has seen POLITICALLY INCORRECT or his current show REAL TIME have repeatedly seen those who stand as far to the right as possible laughing their heads off as Maher makes one quip after another.  There is no denying that he is a funny, funny man, and he is very funny in this comedy routine, a routine that originally appeared on HBO as a comedy special.Maher is also, unfortunately, one of the most astute political commentators in America.  I say unfortunately because, as Jon Stewart has repeatedly pointed out, there is something extremely sad about two of the finest political analysts in America being comedians.  In fact, the only two political columnists I consistently rate above Maher and Stewart for depth of insight are Paul Krugman and E. J. Dionne.  Typically, Maher is perceived as being very far to the left, but that is actually somewhat a freak of the times.  At many points in the history of the U.S. he would probably be perceived as being much further to the right.  He is in many regards, as he often points out himself, a classic libertarian, though without the utopian mania about the blessings that a completely unfettered free market would generate.  But he is in many regards pretty much a classic Jeffersonian.  Jefferson famously wrote in his NOTES ON VIRGINIA:  ""It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god. In neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.""  In context Jefferson wrote trying to limit the extent of government in people's lives, but today we see a vast number of people who want to extend the intrusion of religion into goverment because they do feel that policy decisions with which they disagree do in fact do them harm.  Gay marriage is the classic example of this.  Maher finds this lamentable, and he articulates this over and over.  Essentially, he is calling for the same kind of tolerance that Jefferson advocated so strongly.  This is not an especially left wing position:  Barry Goldwater disliked the rise of the Reaganites because he saw them as meddling too much in the moral lives of individuals.If intolerance of individual opinion is one of Maher's targets, another is stupidity.  He is brilliant at identifying nonsense and characterizing it as such.  He is also unswerving in calling a dime a dime.  For instance, he points out the cowardly lack of courage shown by the media for referring to Strom Thurmond's fathering a child by a black servant in the 1925 Jim Crow South Carolina as ""having an affair,"" as if and 18-year-old black servant had any choice in the matter.  Maher calls it what it almost certainly was:  rape.But as he calls our attention to one political issue after another, Maher laces it with humor.  So, in the end there are two very good reasons to see this, first to be entertained, and second to be informed.  Either reason would be sufficient on its own, but together they make this a must-see.",4,A typically wise and funny Bill Maher production,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,3256,"['many', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'joke', 'politics', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'distinction', 'being', 'extremely', 'funny', 'Even', 'disagree', 'opinions', 'do', 'when', 'religion', 'happen', 'believe', 'religious', 'not', 'only', 'compatible', 'leftist', 'thinking', 'New', 'Testament', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'POLITICALLY', 'INCORRECT', 'current', 'show', 'REAL', 'TIME', 'have', 'repeatedly', 'seen', 'who', 'stand', 'far', 'right', 'possible', 'laughing', 'heads', 'off', 'Maher', 'one', 'quip', 'denying', 'funny', 'funny', 'man', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'routine', 'routine', 'originally', 'appeared', 'HBO', 'comedy', 'special.Maher', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'most', 'astute', 'political', 'commentators', 'America', 'say', 'unfortunately', 'because', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'repeatedly', 'pointed', 'out', 'something', 'extremely', 'sad', 'two', 'finest', 'political', 'analysts', 'America', 'being', 'comedians', 'fact', 'only', 'two', 'political', 'columnists', 'consistently', 'rate', 'Maher', 'Stewart', 'depth', 'insight', 'are', 'Paul', 'Krugman', 'E.', 'J.', 'Dionne', 'Typically', 'Maher', 'perceived', 'being', 'very', 'far', 'left', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'freak', 'times', 'many', 'points', 'history', 'U.S.', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'perceived', 'being', 'much', 'further', 'right', 'many', 'regards', 'often', 'out', 'classic', 'libertarian', 'utopian', 'mania', 'blessings', 'completely', 'unfettered', 'free', 'market', 'would', 'generate', 'many', 'regards', 'pretty', 'much', 'classic', 'Jeffersonian', 'Jefferson', 'famously', 'wrote', 'NOTES', 'ON', 'VIRGINIA', 'injury', 'neighbor', 'say', 'are', 'twenty', 'gods', 'god', 'picks', 'pocket', 'breaks', 'leg', 'context', 'Jefferson', 'wrote', 'trying', 'limit', 'extent', 'government', 'people', 'lives', 'today', 'see', 'vast', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'extend', 'intrusion', 'religion', 'goverment', 'do', 'feel', 'policy', 'decisions', 'disagree', 'do', 'fact', 'do', 'harm', 'Gay', 'marriage', 'classic', 'example', 'Maher', 'lamentable', 'over', 'over', 'Essentially', 'calling', 'same', 'kind', 'tolerance', 'Jefferson', 'advocated', 'so', 'strongly', 'not', 'especially', 'left', 'wing', 'position', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', 'disliked', 'rise', 'Reaganites', 'saw', 'meddling', 'too', 'much', 'moral', 'lives', 'individuals.If', 'intolerance', 'individual', 'opinion', 'one', 'Maher', 'targets', 'stupidity', 'brilliant', 'identifying', 'nonsense', 'characterizing', 'such', 'also', 'unswerving', 'calling', 'dime', 'dime', 'instance', 'out', 'cowardly', 'lack', 'courage', 'shown', 'media', 'referring', 'Strom', 'Thurmond', 'fathering', 'child', 'black', 'servant', '1925', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'South', 'Carolina', 'having', 'affair', '18-year-old', 'black', 'servant', 'had', 'choice', 'matter', 'Maher', 'what', 'almost', 'certainly', 'was', 'rape.But', 'attention', 'one', 'political', 'issue', 'Maher', 'humor', 'So', 'end', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'reasons', 'see', 'first', 'be', 'entertained', 'second', 'be', 'informed', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'sufficient', 'own', 'together', 'make', 'must-see']",N/A

I watched this video thinking I'm glad he stopped wearing it with that part on the side. Anyway, watching a Bill Maher comedy skit is sure to either offend or make you laugh out loud and sometimes it's a little of both. As usual Maher took on politics, religion and weed. At some points it just sounded like a long rant about Bush versus Kerry, and I enjoyed reliving the issues I was groaning about in 2005, too.His points about abortion reminded me of Chris Rock's ""I don't think it's right, but I understand"" skits. Both of these guys are my favorite comedians and both are not afraid to get into politics so I'll probably always be a fan. I feel the same way about abortion that Maher does, but he lost me completely when he started talking about how some weed songs are worth kids dying. I know it was supposed to be a joke, but I didn't laugh. That's the thing about Maher. Sometimes he goes a little too far so I'm glad when he brings it back home. Minus the songs equaling kids' deaths, I enjoyed it and laughed through the entire thing.Only Maher can make serious but humorous jokes about how ridiculous and borderline gay it was to take photos next to naked men and equate it to torture. I found those photos strange, too. I also thought it was interesting that he even called his own self out about being fired. Gotta love him.",4,"Always funny, not for the faint of heart",1289433600,"11 11, 2010",2010,1390,"['like', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'hair', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'slicked', 'back', 'watched', 'video', 'thinking', ""'m"", 'glad', 'stopped', 'wearing', 'part', 'side', 'Anyway', 'watching', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'comedy', 'skit', 'sure', 'offend', 'make', 'loud', 'little', 'usual', 'Maher', 'took', 'politics', 'religion', 'weed', 'points', 'just', 'sounded', 'long', 'rant', 'Bush', 'versus', 'Kerry', 'enjoyed', 'reliving', 'issues', 'was', 'groaning', 'about', '2005', 'points', 'abortion', 'reminded', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'right', 'understand', 'skits', 'guys', 'are', 'favorite', 'comedians', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'get', 'politics', 'so', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'always', 'be', 'fan', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'abortion', 'Maher', 'lost', 'completely', 'when', 'started', 'talking', 'how', 'weed', 'songs', 'are', 'worth', 'kids', 'dying', 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'joke', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'thing', 'Maher', 'Sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'so', ""'m"", 'glad', 'when', 'back', 'home', 'songs', 'equaling', 'kids', 'deaths', 'enjoyed', 'laughed', 'entire', 'thing.Only', 'can', 'make', 'serious', 'humorous', 'jokes', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'borderline', 'gay', 'was', 'take', 'photos', 'naked', 'men', 'equate', 'torture', 'found', 'photos', 'strange', 'too', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'even', 'called', 'own', 'self', 'being', 'fired', 'Got', 'ta', 'love']",N/A
929274,A6S8DJ4TOM2BF,B000ANVQ5U,Wade Tomlin,"[2, 5]","I'm Swiss by Bill Maher sees the comedian take a step down from his previous DVD Victory Begins At Home. On Victory... Maher managed a more complete summation of his times and the ability to tie in the themes with his book of political posters made that presentation probably the highlight of Maher's stand-up career. So if you might be new to his comedy my suggestion would be to watch Victory first.I'm Swiss on the other hand is by no means bad, but does suffer from a feel of been there done that as his criticism of the Bush administration comes across as going to the well a little too often.  Even if you are new to Maher, Bush putdowns seem a little tired especially considering this show was after a U.S. presidential election.The highlights instead are when he goes into other directions like his translating of Rap music lyrics into ""white."" Also, his strong support of gay marriage seems to be more of the times then his Bush put-downs.Maher seems to have become boxed in by his political commentary as his audience seems to genuinely enjoy his jabs at the far right, but the problem now seems that Maher risks becoming a clich&eacute; in his presentations in the same way political commentators become very repetitive at election time. I hope he takes his comedy in a new direction and more strongly focuses on at least a new political target.I'm Swiss however will be required watching for any Maher fan as his summations are always uniquely his. That what makes each of DVDs worth watching as a fan because Maher consistently points his edge in a direction few comedians dare to go. Think Seinfeld going to fill a hall talking U.S. politics? Don't think so.Therefore you are a fan of Maher, get I'm Swiss. If you are not I would advise Victory as your first purchase, and if you like that one, you'll probably naturally buy this one because each of his presentations contain his own unique material.",4,"Good, but a come down from Victory",1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,1914,"[""'m"", 'Swiss', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'comedian', 'take', 'step', 'down', 'previous', 'DVD', 'Victory', 'Begins', 'Home', 'Victory', 'Maher', 'managed', 'more', 'complete', 'summation', 'times', 'ability', 'tie', 'themes', 'book', 'political', 'posters', 'made', 'presentation', 'probably', 'highlight', 'Maher', 'stand-up', 'career', 'So', 'might', 'be', 'new', 'comedy', 'suggestion', 'would', 'be', 'watch', 'Victory', 'first.I', ""'m"", 'Swiss', 'other', 'hand', 'means', 'bad', 'suffer', 'feel', 'been', 'done', 'criticism', 'Bush', 'administration', 'across', 'going', 'well', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'Even', 'are', 'new', 'Maher', 'Bush', 'putdowns', 'seem', 'little', 'tired', 'especially', 'considering', 'show', 'was', 'U.S.', 'presidential', 'election.The', 'highlights', 'instead', 'are', 'when', 'other', 'directions', 'translating', 'Rap', 'music', 'lyrics', 'white', 'Also', 'strong', 'support', 'gay', 'marriage', 'be', 'more', 'times', 'then', 'Bush', 'put-downs.Maher', 'have', 'become', 'boxed', 'political', 'commentary', 'audience', 'genuinely', 'enjoy', 'jabs', 'far', 'right', 'problem', 'now', 'Maher', 'risks', 'becoming', 'clich', 'eacute', 'presentations', 'same', 'way', 'political', 'commentators', 'become', 'very', 'repetitive', 'election', 'time', 'hope', 'comedy', 'new', 'direction', 'more', 'strongly', 'least', 'new', 'political', 'target.I', ""'m"", 'Swiss', 'however', 'will', 'be', 'required', 'watching', 'Maher', 'fan', 'summations', 'are', 'always', 'uniquely', 'what', 'DVDs', 'worth', 'watching', 'fan', 'Maher', 'consistently', 'edge', 'direction', 'few', 'comedians', 'dare', 'go', 'Think', 'Seinfeld', 'going', 'fill', 'hall', 'talking', 'U.S.', 'politics', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.Therefore', 'are', 'fan', 'Maher', 'get', ""'m"", 'Swiss', 'are', 'not', 'would', 'advise', 'Victory', 'first', 'purchase', 'like', 'one', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'naturally', 'buy', 'one', 'presentations', 'contain', 'own', 'unique', 'material']",N/A
