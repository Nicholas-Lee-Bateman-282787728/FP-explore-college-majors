The actor who plays Elvis, Dale Midkiff, is terrible and plays Elvis like a complete sleaze.  Truly, every time he's on screen you want to upchuck he's so slimy.  He has none of the charisma Elvis had and didn't bother doing the slightest amount of research to learn how Elvis talked, walked, moved on stage or anything else.  It's hard to believe Priscilla was a part of making this movie.  It's total trash.  All the acting is like something you'd see in a high school play.

They really should put this on DVD. Only gave good rating  because the price was fair. Turning it into a DVD yourself may be a better solution. Instead of charging people for more then its worth. Not this seller of course. But all others' who are out there that do to like this movie.

This was a  great love story, but i also had to keep reminding myself that this movie  was a true story based on Priscilla Presley's Memoirs.

182827,A21UTGGBTF6DUA,1560681462,"sp ""Critics Rule""","[0, 5]","This is the film based on the book Elvis &amp; Me which is Priscilla's official version of events on life with the King. It sticks pretty closely to the events in the book but how true they are, only she knows.The actress playing Priscilla looks quite like her but Dale Midkiff, who plays Elvis is nothing like him although having said that, is a good looking guy in his own right.  It shows Priscilla as the loving girlfriend and wife who is driven to leaving her man by his abuse of drugs and women, which is probably true.  Large chunks are missed completely, the famous comeback, Elvis's disillusionment with his career and the fact they had no marriage after the birth of Lisa Marie, his obsession with religion and hardly any mention of the Colonel.However, I think Priscilla put up with a lot and has, when all is said and done, given Elvis the career, in death, that he should have had in life.However, some of the scenes are hilarious, the honeymoon scene is moronic, Elvis running out of the bedroom with his police torch and throwning it at the wall, Elvis turning up in 1976 to Priscilla &quot;modest&quot; home with his jump suit on (give me a break!).  Did he want her back, who knows?If you want a good laugh and have 3 hours to spare buy this and be glad you ain't famous!

And the movie shows Elvis and Priscilla before and after their marriage. Elvis Presley's mom Gladys Presley died in August the year before Elvis met his future (and only wife). The Movie starts out in 1959 in Austin Texas, where Priscilla (Susan Walters) has to move to Germany. While in Germany she meets Currie Grant (Greg Webb) at a club (where an Elvis Presley look alike contest) is going on. He asks her to meet Elvis. And she talks to her Mom (Linda Miller) and step-father (Jon Cypher). They agree and off to Elvis' house. Where she meets Elvis' father Vernon (Billy Green Bush) and Elvis's grandma Minnie Mae Presley (the late Anne Hanley) and Elvis Presley (Dale Midkiff).
