1103936,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B000VS6R3A,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[3, 3]","This classic television series holds up quite well, all things considering and especially in comparison with later products like The Wild Wild West, which were very obviously shot on back-lots or locations in the near vicinity of Griffith Park. No expense seems to have been spared for ""Rawhide"" as regards to locations, props and the essential livestock. It became a bit of a joke later on, for TV westerns to be ostensibly set on a cattle ranch with never a cow actually to be seen, but this series managed to escape that ""stock"" situation. Just as well, considering that it was supposed to take place during a cattle drive from Texas to rail heads in Kansas just after the Civil War, and the movement of a large group of cattle is absolutely central to much of the various episode plots. Quite a lot of action takes place out of doors, on horseback and in conjunction with the aforementioned herd of cattle, and such location shoots are integrated fairly seamlessly with the sound-staged moments. Oddly enough, the fact that it is in black and white lends something of an air of realism to the show; everyone generally appears authentically grubby, sweaty and hard-working.The episodes contained in this four-disc collection were originally broadcast in 1960. In many ways the show is in peak form; the characters of tough and gritty trail boss Gil Favor (Eric Fleming) and his drovers are well-enough developed, but not yet worn out. There are all kinds of fresh angles to find out about the characters - Wishbone the cook (Paul Brinegar),  Pete Nolan (Sheb Woolley) and cowhand Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood - yes, that Clint Eastwood). Eastwood is not actually the top bill in the series credits - the appearance of the box cover art to the contrary. Eric Fleming was very much the series star; the series was canceled very shortly after he departed the show in the mid 1960s. While watching this series, my daughter and I wondered why we had never seen him in anything else; he played an immensely likable and complicated character, and the show was popular all during its' eight season run. It turns out that he was drowned in an accident on location for another adventure show within a year or so after leaving the cast of ""Rawhide"".",4,A Cowboy With Real Cows,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,2240,"['classic', 'television', 'series', 'quite', 'well', 'things', 'considering', 'especially', 'comparison', 'later', 'products', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'were', 'very', 'obviously', 'shot', 'back-lots', 'locations', 'near', 'vicinity', 'Griffith', 'Park', 'No', 'expense', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'Rawhide', 'regards', 'locations', 'props', 'essential', 'livestock', 'became', 'bit', 'joke', 'later', 'TV', 'westerns', 'be', 'ostensibly', 'set', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'never', 'cow', 'actually', 'be', 'seen', 'series', 'managed', 'escape', 'stock', 'situation', 'Just', 'as', 'well', 'considering', 'was', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'cattle', 'drive', 'Texas', 'rail', 'heads', 'Kansas', 'just', 'Civil', 'War', 'movement', 'large', 'group', 'cattle', 'absolutely', 'central', 'much', 'various', 'episode', 'plots', 'lot', 'action', 'place', 'doors', 'horseback', 'conjunction', 'aforementioned', 'herd', 'cattle', 'such', 'location', 'shoots', 'are', 'integrated', 'fairly', 'seamlessly', 'sound-staged', 'moments', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'fact', 'black', 'white', 'lends', 'something', 'air', 'realism', 'show', 'everyone', 'generally', 'authentically', 'grubby', 'sweaty', 'hard-working.The', 'episodes', 'contained', 'four-disc', 'collection', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', '1960', 'many', 'ways', 'show', 'peak', 'form', 'characters', 'tough', 'gritty', 'trail', 'boss', 'Gil', 'Favor', 'Eric', 'Fleming', 'drovers', 'are', 'well-enough', 'developed', 'not', 'yet', 'worn', 'out', 'are', 'kinds', 'fresh', 'angles', 'find', 'out', 'characters', 'Wishbone', 'cook', 'Paul', 'Brinegar', 'Pete', 'Nolan', 'Sheb', 'Woolley', 'cowhand', 'Rowdy', 'Yates', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'yes', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'actually', 'top', 'bill', 'series', 'appearance', 'box', 'cover', 'art', 'contrary', 'Eric', 'Fleming', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'series', 'star', 'series', 'was', 'canceled', 'very', 'shortly', 'departed', 'show', 'mid', '1960s', 'watching', 'series', 'daughter', 'wondered', 'why', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'else', 'played', 'immensely', 'likable', 'complicated', 'character', 'show', 'was', 'popular', 'eight', 'season', 'run', 'out', 'was', 'drowned', 'accident', 'location', 'adventure', 'show', 'year', 'so', 'leaving', 'cast', 'Rawhide']","Rawhide: Season 2, Vol. 2"

It will be great to have pristine quality prints of each episode and to see Eric Fleming as tough as nails Trail Boss- Gil Favor. There's never been anyone close to him. I don't think the price is high at all. I live in the U.K. and it costs more for me to order it  in from the USA- it's worth every cent ( penny in U.K) I really do hope they release every season. They will providing all the true fans get out there and buy it.If you don't buy it we won't see more will we? The trouble with reviewers telling us not to buy,it just to complain is that they are not grasping the solid fact that to do  so will stop the release of further Rawhide sets, we, Rawhide true fans can't do that- we want these sets asap, and they are such good value for money no matter what others say, compare these prices to the old video, 2 episodes at a time and much, much more expensive.

Lovins ""Mr. Jim""","[0, 0]","CBS Television and Paramount Pictures presents ""RAWHIDE: SECOND SEASON VOL TWO"" (5 February 1960 - 17 June 1960) (822 mins/In Glorious Black & White) (digitally remastered in Dolby) -- Rawhide was a television western series that aired on the U.S. network CBS from 1959 to 1966. The show starred Eric Fleming and launched the career of Clint Eastwood --- The series ran for eight seasons on the CBS network on Friday nights, from January 9, 1959 to January 4, 1966, with a total of 217 episodes, all filmed and broadcast in black and white --- It was produced and sometimes directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also produced early episodes of Gunsmoke --- Warren based Rawhide on the movie Cattle Empire that he directed in 1958 and for which Endre Bohem was a screenwriter and Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan were actors; all also worked in Rawhide --- Its premiere episode reached the top 20 in the Nielsen Ratings. It rose steadily in popularity until, towards the end of the series run, it was one of America's top ten shows --- Rawhide was the fourth longest-running American TV western, beaten only by nine years of The Virginian and Wagon Train, fourteen years of Bonanza, and twenty years of Gunsmoke.The episode would be introduced, usually by some words from Gil Favor but sometimes by others --- The typical Rawhide story involved drovers, portrayed by Eric Fleming (Trail Boss Gil Favor) and Clint Eastwood (ramrod Rowdy Yates), coming upon people on the trail and getting drawn into solving whatever problem they presented or were confronting --- Some of the stories were obviously easier in production terms but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its situations could range from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and so forth --- A problem on such drives was the constant need for water, and the scout spent much of his time looking for it, sometimes finding water holes, even rivers had dried up - In some ways it was similar to the TV series Wagon Train that debuted in 1957.Of all the western characters on TV, these were the only real cowboys, because they drove cows. There were also sheep boys who drove sheep, pig boys who looked after pigs, etc. The name cowboys became a generic name in western films and TV series --- The theme song's lyrics were written by Ned Washington in 1958. It was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin and sung by pop singer Frankie Laine. The theme song became very popular --- It was covered several times and parts of the song also appear in more recent movies like The Blues Brothers and Shrek.-- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)List of Season, Episode, Title and Original Air Date:Season 2, Episode 17: Incident at Tinker's Dam  (guest stars Monte Blue & Anthony Dexter)Original Air Date--5 February 1960Season 2, Episode 18: Incident of the Night Horse  (guest star George Wallace)Original Air Date--19 February 1960Season 2, Episode 19: Incident of the Sharpshooter (guest stars Jock Mahoney,Norman Leavitt, Kenne Duncan & Fred LernerOriginal Air Date--26 February 1960Season 2, Episode 20: Incident of the Dust Flower  (guest stars Tom Drake)Original Air Date--4 March 1960Season 2, Episode 21: Incident at Sulphur Creek  (guest star John Dehner)Original Air Date--11 March 1960Season 2, Episode 22: Incident of the Champagne Bottles(guest stars Patricia Barry,Lane Bradford, John Hart & Hugh Marlowe)Original Air Date--18 March 1960Season 2, Episode 23: Incident of the Stargazer  (guest stars Buddy Ebsen & Richard Webb)Original Air Date--1 April 1960Season 2, Episode 24: Incident of the Dancing Death  (guest stars Anthony Caruso & Warren Oates)Original Air Date--8 April 1960Season 2, Episode 25: Incident of the Arana Sacar  (guest star Cloris Leachman)Original Air Date--22 April 1960Season 2, Episode 26: Incident of the Deserter  (guest stars Bob Steele & Rush Williams)Original Air Date--29 April 1960Season 2, Episode 27: Incident of the One Hundred Amulets  (guest star R.G.

Rawhide was one of the best western series for television and it sure deserved 5 stars... but not the product released by greedy Paramount. For it, only 1 star, nothing else. Two volumes for a complete season 2 at $38.99 each (official price) means $ 77.98 for a single season! This is a very high price...and ridiculous too! Paramount is not doing right with the Rawhide series. Why so much focus on Clint Eastwood for the box covers? Eric Fleming was the real star of Rawhide and he is always ""small and in the background"" on the boxes! I understand Clint is famous today, and Eric Fleming is almost forgotten, but he was the main character in Rawhide, and, at the time, a better actor than Eastwood.

Rowdy is also incredible in this series. The details of the old west in this series are fantastic. They don't make anything like it nowadays and we'll probably never see anything like it again.Thank you Paramount!Here's a great editorial review for Rawhide belowLike anyone growing up in the late fifties and early sixties I watched as much television as possible. Remember that this was the era of the eleven inch, black and white screen, the single three inch speaker and the universal remote was the youngest family member who had to get up to turn the knobs. This was also the golden years of television. The series that were around back then created the genres that are still around decades later. There was also something special about TV back then, it was the era of the western. Every single boy had a cowboy hat, boots and play six shooter. Even the girls refused to be left out and clamored for a fringe skirt cowgirl outfit and hat. The vast majority of television programming was dedicated to the American old west. Every network, all three of them, filled their schedules with one variation of the theme after another. Most of those series are now only a small footnote in the history of television. Several remain today as cult classics and the undisputed leaders in this field. After `Gunsmoke' one TV western still stands above the rest `Rawhide'. This was `THE' show to watch back then. We kids would put on our cowboy gear, make the coffee table into a covered wagon and sit there mesmerized by the action. This is more than an old television show; for many of us this is a piece of our personal history.The folks over at Paramount Pictures have the most incredible vault of classic television series imaginable. Anybody would love to be able to sit there for a month or two watching the myriad of shows they have on tap. Since this is not a likely prospect it is very fortunate that Paramount has been in a sharing mood. Lately they have been bringing out DVD set after set of series from these golden years. Now they have the second volume of the second season and like the previous ones, it is fantastic. The thing about `Rawhide' is it may have been one of the most famous television westerns but it was not very typical of the genre. Most westerns had the required action. There were good guys with white hats and bad one wearing black and the Native Americans, `Indians' back then, where rarely more than savages. Rawhide took a different slant. It was a dramatic series that just happened to be set in the old west. The six-shooter was there but not as important as the moral and emotional dilemmas the characters faced each week. The stories were centered on the characters over mindless action. It was possible to do this back then. Now so much of television has degenerated into mindless pap that it is easy to forget just how powerful this medium is. In those days everything was new and the studios were willing to take a chance. Rawhide stands the test of time because it dared to be different. So bring in the youngsters and let them see television the way it was meant to be. If they complain just make them stand behind the TV holding a set of rabbit ear antennas like we had to.The premise of the series is elegant in its simplicity following the lives a group of cowboys working on a cattle drive. Many westerns showed cowboys riding around, shooing cattle now and again but it always felt like the cowpokes really didn't have a whole lot to do. This series depicted the arduous struggle to move a heard of cattle from one location to another. It was a daily hardship battling the weather, rustlers, the cattle and even each other. The drama of the series came organically from the realism of the characters and stories. These were the kind of men that built the west. At the head of the chain of command is Gil Favor (Eric Fleming), the trail boss. He is the one in command of the drovers and support staff on the drive. He is a man who has been around and seen it all. Although he is grizzled and tough he is also fair. His right hand man is Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood), the ramrod. It is up to him to work along side the men making sure they do things right. While the men keep the cattle in line it is up to Rowdy to keep them moving in the right direction. Also in constant attendance is Wishbone (Paul Brinegar) the camp cook. He you are responsible for providing a group of hungry cowboys with chow you have to be ready for just about anything. He depends on his assistant Mushy (James Murdock). One of the senior wranglers is Hey Soos (Robert Cabal) he is not a stranger to getting into trouble. Usually there to scout out the land ahead is Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley).This series doesn't look or feel like a television show at all. It is more like short, 50 minute, movies. The production quality here is spectacular. There is more emphasis on the plot than action. The fight scenes are just a small part of the series and this set it apart from the large pack of westerns back then. Life on a long cattle drive was shown in a realistic fashion. On such a trek boredom was the real enemy. Cowpokes looking for some excitement on their down time would head off to the nearest town and typically get into some mess or another. There are also plenty of slice of life shots. In one the men side around the chuck wagon, the center of cattle drive society, and grab a snack, mend their clothes, get in a snooze or tend to their saddles. These quite times were usually disrupted by some form of mayhem. Either it is a group of cattle rustlers out to steal the heard or an Indiana attack that forces the cowboys into action. Each episode was titles `Incident at ...' which is extremely fitting. These stories are notable incidents on an otherwise routine cattle drive.Every episode begins with Gil waxing philosophically about some aspect of his line of work. Whether it is how the good Lord swells a little stream so it takes days to cross or the economics of bringing in the heard on time and in sellable shape Gil gets to show off his deeper side. This was also the series that made a star out of Clint Eastwood. He is more than an actor; he is a true renaissance man who has achieved fame as an actor, director, jazz musician, composer and even a politician. This is where it all began for him. He could stare down the meanest bad guy with a single stare and if necessary back it up with his six-shooter. Also gaining a good deal of fame here was the singer of the theme song, Frankie Lane. This song has lived on long after the series was cancelled and is known throughout the world.Paramount certainly took care of the original elements of this series. The black and white full screen video is incredibly clear. There is a little speck every so often but over all the video is excellent. This is better than I remember the show ever being. the Dolby 2.0 mono is clear and without flaw. These episodes are completely re-mastered and it shows. Typical of an older television set for Paramount there are no extras included. That really doesn't matter here; the series is a great buy on its own. This is a must have for everyone that appreciates quality television.",5,the gold standard in western excellence,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,8562,"['greatest', 'western', 'there', 'ever', 'been',

For some reason Rawhide was kept all this time from being release on video or dvd and that was disappointing.  But something good, something excellent is well worth waiting for!  After watching the first season I realised how really great early tv was, well some of it that is...and Rawhide was one.  Season 2 both volumes are fantastic...again the biggest disappointment is the produces discison to break up the seasons into 2 charging the same as for one.

I am elated to see shows from my childhood that I haven't seen since their original air dates. For the quality and the thrill of seeing old favorites I would give this release 5 stars. On the minus side there are no special features, plus this and other studios have started to break up seasons into multiple volumes. For that they earn 3 stars, averaging to 4 stars.
