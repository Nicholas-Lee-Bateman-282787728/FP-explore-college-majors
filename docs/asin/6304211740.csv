I have seen this film quite a few times, but only in bits and pieces.

I watched this with interest.I rather liked the young Adelle and the other characters at Thornfield.  However, the grave dissapointment came from Mr. Rochester.  While I am sure this gentleman may be a fine actor elsewhere, he was not suited for this role.  His coloring, his non-accent, his build, his mannerisms, all of these things gave him a large hurdle to overcome, and unfortunately he never did.

407619,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6304211740,Andrew Raker,"[24, 29]","I won't take a long time writting this review. Simply put, this film is horrible in my opinion because (1) it leaves out so many scenes that are vival to understanding Jane's passion, (2) its acting is far from superior, (3) its sets are no better than in the 1983 BBC Jane Eyre, and (4) the film costs as much money as many of the other Jane Eyre versions that are considerably more accurate and better produced.Now, for people who have read the novel ""Jane Eyre"" by Charlotte Bronte, they realize that a man named St. John Rivers plays an important role in the novel. In this film, St. John and his sisters all but eliminated. The same situation of elimination occurs for many other minor characters. The dialogue from the novel that is kept is combined and changed from classic English to modern American. I am sorry if people have a problem hearing the long discussions Jane and Edward have together. However, for a literature fanatic, this Jane Eyre version is much to short - lacking in intelligence.I personally recommend the 1983 Jane Eyre version starring Timothy Dalton as Edward Fairfax Rochester, and Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre. The BBC film keeps nearly all of the dialogue and many of the scenes. The BBC 1983 film is far more intelligent and insightful into the struggles Jane Eyre faces. For those who dislike Timothy Dalton playing Rochester, I recommend the 1973 BBC adaptation starring Michael Jayston as Rochester.

407624,AAGK7UK5BHSX4,6304211740,"Born-Identity ""19973""","[5, 6]","Jane Eyre is one of my most beloved classics.  Everyone has different tastes and takes on Bronte's wonderful literary work, so when offering my review on this adaptation to it, its of course based upon my opinion and perception.For me this adaptation lacks Bronte's Jane Eyre on so many levels.The romance is tepid.  The passion is lackluster.  The gothic feel you get when reading the book and following Jane through the dark halls of Thornfield Hall is totally nil here.  Having a dark room lit with candles doesn't constitute ""goth.""  I don't recall a convincing scene of the budding romance either.Mr. Rochester is a combination of so many extremes of emotion in the book.  He's funny, witty, mischievious, dark, brooding, tormented and quite the rascal - sometimes all within the same scene! William Hurt is none of the above in my opinion.Jane in the book is quiet and reserved, but her mind is racing and moving with emotion and I just didn't buy that it was happening with Charlotte Gainsbourg's portrayal.  The book goes through extreme highs and lows which is why you can't put the book down once she meets Mr. Rochester. This adaptation never quite pulls that off and just flatlines for me from beginning to end.My favorite version of Jane Eyre by far is the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version.  It is truly the book brought to life.  After that if pushed for second choice, it would have to be the more recent Masterpiece version.83' Dalton/Clark version:When watching the 83' Dalton version, AT FIRST you'll want to throw something at your TV because it is broken up into 30 minute episodes the way the series ran on television and is shown almost as a stage play.  But it doesn't take long to overlook the stagey feel of it because in filming it this way (whether intentional or not) you truly are transported into the dark ambience and mystery of Thornfield Hall. There are shadows at every turn and you find yourself becoming apprehensive as if you were walking those dark halls of echoing laughter along with Jane.Also, a hearty pat on the back to the casting director of the 83' version for the absolute BRILLIANT casting of Timothy Dalton as the dark, passionate, poetic, tortured, mischievious and introspective soul that is Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Bronte would've been so proud!  He is no longer a character in a book when seeing this version because Timothy Dalton IS Mr. Rochester.At first I couldn't understand the casting of Zelah Clark but was soon won over by her reserved but sharp portrayal and unearthly appearance.  She truly embodied Bronte's post-Helen Jane as she was able to assert herself without compromising her station and position the same way the book's Jane did. Her acting was incredible too because you felt her emotions as she went through stages of a wide-eyed developing crush, her attempts to supress her feelings for her superior, her fears of the mysteries of the dark hall, her pain when discovering the truth, her resolve not to rebel against her conscience, then following her heart.  Other more modern day Jane portrayals have been far too impertinent for Jane's position in that time period and way more experienced than a Jane whose life's experience consisted only of Gateshead and Lowood.  Bronte fans will truly appreciate and understand how this 25 year old version still stands the test of time.  You can literally open the book and follow it along and believe me, that is a good thing!  Bronte's beautifully written words are not at all lost in this version and Timothy Dalton's delivery is far superior to all Mr. Rochesters cast before or after him.Masterpiece Theatre 2006For a more overtly demonstrated ""passion"" that in my opinion defies the period and post Helen Jane, but is beautifully filmed is the Masterpiece Theatre version.  It takes quite the liberties with Jane's moral dilemmas. In some cases dismissing them altogether which when understanding the book's Jane, knows this changes who she is completely.  In this version, neither character really has to guess or question the other's feelings or motives the way you do in the book and the 83 version, thus not as suspenseful in my opinion.

While it is not a strict adaptation, I feel it successfully brings the novel alive. William Hurt was excellant as Mr. Rochester and it was easy to see why Jane would fall in love with him. I also very much liked the actress that played Jane Eyre. She did look the age and looked plain and depressed (like I think anyone with Jane Eyre's life would look). The look of the film was also excellant. Anna Paquin as the young Jane Eyre was also an excellant choice. I prefer this version over the 1997 Samantha Morton version. That version Mr. Rochester is far from appealing, Jane is not so believable and it is hard to believe the two would have an attraction for each other. The 1997 version's Mr. Rochester is very ugly (uglier than I'd imagined Mr. Rochester), mean, rude and very demanding/commanding. He doesn't reflect a tortured soul, but rather a plain old grumpy and mean one and his portrayal of passion and attraction is rather poor. There were no sparks between the two, only poorly delivered lines. William Hurt, on the other hand, is able to portray both the sarcasm, wit, poor manners and inner turmoil of Mr. Rochester. He is also far more capable at portraying passion and love (as is the actress that plays Jane) than comparted to the 1997 Samantha Morton version.I cared deeply for all of the main characters in this film and was able to connect with the story.

Zeffirelli doesn't drag the show on; his editing is quite brisk, without compromising the lushness of his visuals (his Baroque sensibility expresses itself with almost evangelical power when Helen Burns unleashes her red mane--the gift of beauty which the Lowood puritans would strip away).  Esteemed cinematographer David Watkin is in at least Oscar-nomination-worthy form here, managing the occasional touch of soft-focus diffused morning light without making the picture look frilly.  As ubiquitous as badly-done gold tones have become, it's a great relief to look at a film with such a lush sense of the barren.  But best of all, Charlotte Gainsbourg is absolutely hypnotic as Jane.  To paraphrase another Bronte: &quot;Nelly, she IS Jane!&quot;  It's amazing to behold such an unconventional beauty-- praise the gods for Zeffirelli bringing her to an English-language audience.  Her brooding manner, her sense of merit scorned, her hidden yet bound-to-burst amorousness--Gainsbourg ravishes with her quiet luminescence.  And the set of her mouth is one of nature's masterworks.  I could never forget her face in the mirror--she manages to incarnate the literary Jane's patient capacity for self-blame with tear-inducing force.

This version was very disappointing to say the least.  There was absolutely no ""passion"" between Jane and Rochester.  Jane showed no emotion and lacked personality.  The dialogue was delivered without any real feeling or emotion behind it.  As much as I love the book, I was bored with this movie.  I always imagined Jane, despite her Lowood schooling, to have a little fire inside her--able to handle Mr Rochester in his anger and not afraid to tease him a little.  This Jane seemed so melancholy and lacked any spirit.Although I don't mind changes to a story in general, I found the changes in this story annoying since huge chunks of the book were rewritten:  return to Gateshead, St John and only one sister who take on a completely different role than what was written in the book, Thornfield burning....If you are looking for a story with more accuracy to the book, I suggest the 1984(?)Timothy Dalton version.  It is a longer version and therefore includes much more of the original story.  Much of the dialogue comes straight from the book.  It is a bit dated and I feel like I'm watching a play rather than a movie, but it is still very good.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 4]","""Jane Eyre"" seems like a slightly odd choice for the great Franco Zeffirelli, but he turned out a slow if excellent adaptation, full of exquisite scenery and picturesque gothic flavour. But what really makes it brilliant is a virtuoso performance by William Hurt as the tortured hero, even if his costar lacks the necessary passion.Jane Eyre (Anna Paquin) was raised by a nasty aunt-by-marriage, and later taken to a cruel minister's boarding school for girls, where she was humiliated and treated badly. Years later, the grown Jane (Charlotte Gainsbourg) leaves the school behind, taking a job as a governess to a little French girl, at a remote Gothic castle owned by the brooding Mr. Rochester (Hurt).But there are mysteries at the castle -- mad laughter can be heard from the upstairs, and Rochester is tormented by difficulties that have made him ""hard as an India-rubber ball."" Yet Jane still falls in love with her fiery, reclusive employer, and he falls in love with her strange, strong ways -- until the nastiest secret of his life comes out, and threatens to separate them forever.Somehow I never expected this classic gothic novel to be the sort of thing Zeffirelli would have done. But he does an excellent job bringing Charlotte Bronte's story to life, and giving it an unearthly beauty -- lots of misty countrysides, sunlit graveyards, and a looming castle up on a hill like a medieval fortress.It's rather slow-moving -- Jane's nasty childhood takes up a lot of time, for instance. But Zeffirelli builds up suspense and suppressed feeling, all of which climaxes in a literally burning finale -- a magnificently taut and terrifying scene. And he adapts Bronte's prose into intense, vivid dialogue (""Even she is better off here than she would be in a lunatic asylum, but I have spent the last fifteen years in TORMENT!"").Gainsbourg has the required unearthly plainness that Jane Eyre needs, but she lacks the essential intensity and passion that the character possesses. During the movie's most intense scenes, when Rochester's secret is revealed, she doesn't even blink -- she just stands and stares. A young Anna Paquin has a lot more hidden fire early on.But William Hurt is simply stellar as Rochester -- he's not young or handsome, but he has the dark, sardonic, embittered, sorrowful thing down to an art. He's especially great in the final lap, where he plays Rochester with all his bitter anger and love unleashed, and Rochester after a fire ravages his home.

But it can be done. ""Anne of Green Gables"" is one good example, as is the new Disney version of ""Prince Caspian"" (for me, anyway). This movie version of ""Jane Eyre,"" however, is not one of those remarkable films. As per most adaptations of the novel they chose to focus on the love story and left out the rest of Jane's adventures. I understand this was necessary in order to keep the film to regular feature length. But since the love story was the main focus you would think they would work hard to make it truly believable. Unfortunately it came off as completely incomprehensible. The problem? The flat performance of the actress playing Jane. No, she's not supposed to be pretty, and yes, she's supposed to be demure and quiet. But lifeless? Hardly. What makes Jane Eyre a beloved heroine of classic literature is her lively mind and how she unapologetically reveals it to those who take the time to look beyond her calm and proper exterior. The moments in the book where Mr. Rochester catches glimpses of the true Jane are what make their love story believable. This movie skips most of those moments, and when they do briefly show one, the scene is rendered ineffective by the flat, lifeless delivery of the actress. There is no spark of vivacity in her eyes, no indication that her words emanate from a deep well of emotion and intellect. Why would the Mr. Rochester of the movie have even the remotest interest in this Jane? I give the filmmakers props for taking on such a project and hoping to interest a new generation in this great story.

Zeffirelli is known for gorgeously lavish films based of the celebrated classics such as ""Falstaff"" (1964), ""La boh&egrave;me"" (1965), ""The Taming of the Shrew"" (1967), ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1968), his most famous and beloved film, one of the best screen romances that made me feel incredibly close to its young doomed lovers, and many more.Zeffirelli's ""Jane Eyre"" is the most visually beautiful color adaptation of four I have seen. The color palette for the scenes outside Thornfield Hall is delicate and romantic and creates the right atmosphere for the blooming romance of Mr. Edward Rochester, the Master of the estate and his young employee, pale, thin, ""almost un-earthy"" but determined and strong-willed Jane Eyre. Charlotte Gainsbourg, a talented subtle and intelligent actress whom I like in every movie I've seen her made a great Jane. Gainsbourg was surrounded by great supporting cast - Anna Paquin (young Jane), Geraldine Chaplin, Fiona Shaw, and Joan Plowright. Plowright gave the best supporting performance in all ""Jane Eyre"" movies as Mrs. Fairfax, a housekeeper of Thornfield Hall and she is one of the reasons to see this movie. Plowright's Mrs. Fairfax is kind, warm woman with sense of humor, intelligence, and understanding of human's nature. She cares about Jane and wishes her happiness but she does not believe that ""people like Mr. Rochester marry their governesses"".Yes, Zeffirelli's film has a lot to admire but sadly there are some major flaws that spoil the film's charm and decreased it to the level of just an average period peace. One of them is miscast of William Hurt. His Rochester reminds more Richard Mason as Charlotte Bronte described him - passionless and blank-eyed. As good as Gainsbourg was, there was no chemistry between her and Hurt. Hurt neither looked nor played right for the part. He was a big disappointment. Another serious problem is the script. Too many important parts were cut out or strangely mixed together, and several scenes in the end of the movie simply did not make much sense.

407644,A328S9RN3U5M68,6304211740,Grady Harp,"[44, 46]","Oddly enough the Charlotte Bront's classic novel 'Jane Eyre' has had more cinematic transitions than almost any of the old novels.  The story is powerful but with the frequency of film adaptations, even the story grows tired, unless someone breathes new life into the interpretation.  In this case that breath comes from director Franco Zeffirelli who has engaged Hugh Whitemore to open the story as a screenplay.  The results give a different emphasis to the story and one that for this viewer works well.In this particular incarnation the rags to riches heroine Jane Eyre is played with subtlety by the beautiful Charlotte Gainsbourg (with Anna Paquin as the younger version) and Rochester the master of the manor is a William Hurt, playing his character more for life and flesh than the usual darkly sinister keeper of secrets.  What results from the combination of cast and crew is a film that is far more a romance than a vapid mystery:  the fire between Jane and Rochester is palpable and is given more space and time than the other versions which elect to dwell on the mad 'wife' upstairs finally destroyed in the fire that brings Rochester down to Jane's initial stance on the social scale.The cinematography by David Watkin captures the period beautifully as does the musical score by Claudio Capponi and Alessio Vlad.  As with all period pieces the cast of supporting characters paint the various aspects of the novel and here such luminous actors as Joan Plowright, Geraldine Chaplin, Jos&eacute;phine Serre, Maria Schneider, Elle Macpherson, and John Wood among many others offer fully realized portraits of the class distinctions that ruled the era.

407645,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,6304211740,Hikari,"[17, 21]","I had avoided watching this version of Jane Eyre for almost 10 years for one compelling reason:  the thought of William Hurt as Rochester gave me a physical pain.  I couldn't imagine a blond and pasty Rochester with a tendency to squint and whine.  Mr. Hurt's American-ness also seemed like a colossal drawback in portraying a staple character of English literature, particularly as he was the only American in the cast.  I had visions of another laughable outing ala Kevin Costner as Robin Hood.  Having finally viewed it on a night with nothing better to do, I'm pleasantly surprised-He didn't bollocks it up!  I saw the classic version long ago with Orson Welles, and while his portrayal is hazy in my memory, he remains my image of Rochester as he was physically depicted in the novel.  However, with Hurt's blond hair darkened & sporting unflattering mutton-chop sideburns, he is transformed into a much rougher-looking version of his usual somewhat effete self, and so his interpretation of Rochester is not as ridiculous as first imagined.  To his credit he did not attempt a British accent; Bronte's dialog is quite stilted enough in a straight reading and that would've only made things much worse.  Paired with Charlotte Gainsbourg, he makes a surprisingly effective, if unconventional, Rochester.  His habitual pained expression actually serves the part.  Charlotte Gainsbourg steps into the part of Jane with a near-perfect fit.  She embodies Bronte's heroine in every detail but one: her distinct French accent is rather jarring in this most English of English girls.  She is most effective when she is still, and the camera lingers on her austere yet compelling face.  She lacks the spirit of Anna Paquin as young Jane, who is excellent in her all-too-brief role, but she nails Jane's solemn watchfulness & pride.  The transition between the two actresses is cleverly and plausibly handled as they suggest one another physically, even if they don't look exactly alike.  Gainsbourg and Hurt manage an awkward chemistry together which is appropriate, though they fail to solve one of the greatest mysteries of English literature:  Why exactly is 20-year-old Jane, whip-smart & nobody's fool, so drawn to this moody, brusque lout who is old enough to be her father?  Bronte never really explains it, so a movie adaptation can hardly hope to.  The movie, as the book, ends with Jane in the arms of her scarred, misanthropic boss, and we cheer, I guess . . .even though the smart move for Jane would have been to take her newly-inherited money & move to the Riviera or some other less-gloomy place.  Director Zeffirelli has assembled an all-star cast of heavy hitters to lend support, including Joan Plowright as Mrs. Fairfax, John Wood as the cruel & Dickensian master of Lowood School, Geraldine Chaplin playing against type as a cruel headmistress & Maria Schneider, in a tiny & essentially non-speaking part, as the crazy wife in the attic.

407648,AQ5NFBZYOHNQ6,6304211740,"JB ""bookworm""","[6, 7]","This 1996 movie was the first adaptation of Jane Eyre that I ever watched and when I did so I was appalled by it. So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester. Since then I have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel, the three short versions of '44, '70 and '97 and the three mini series of '73, '83 and 2006, and I have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse Rochesters.This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned. Director Franco Zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky, of lonely Rochester standing on a rock, and of Jane looking out of the window - but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life. In addition, his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes. As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester, and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse. There are a number of short conversations between Rochester and Jane, each of them beautifully staged, but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other. We know that they are supposed to fall in love, but we never see it actually happen. The scene in which Rochester wants to find out Jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded Mason has left the house is completely missing, and the farewell scene, the most important scene - the climax - of the novel is reduced to four sentences. Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for Bront's superb lines, neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten, but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out. What remains is just a glimpse of the novel, which does no justice to Charlotte Bront's masterpiece.The cast is a mixed bag: While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed, Anna Paquin's young Jane is more an ill-mannered, pout Lolita than a lonely little girl, longing for love. The ever-reliable Joan Plowright makes a very likable, but far too shrewd Mrs Fairfaix, and one cannot help feeling that Billie Whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain-looking, hard-working Grace Poole. Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grown-up heroine, however, is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre. Looking every bit like 18, thin and frail, with irregular, strong features, she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role. And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance. Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask. But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Jane's character any further. As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues, Gainsbourgh's portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory. This is a pity, as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the '83 version.But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane, there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays. Hurt, who has proven himself to be a fine actor in many good movies, must have been aware that he was physically and type-wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the Rochester of the novel. His Rochester, besides being blond and blue-eyed, is a soft-spoken, well-mannered nobleman, shy and quiet, slightly queer and eccentric, but basically good-natured and mild. He is so far from being irascible, moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous. Additionally, during many moments of the movie, Hurt's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness. Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open. If you compare his Rochester to the strong-willed and charming protagonist of the novel, simply bursting with energy and temperament, it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in Hurt's performance. Still, he offends me less than the Rochesters in the '70, '97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones. Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so, whereas George C. Scott, Ciar&agrave;n Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could, but failed miserably, and I'd rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played. And I'd rather watch a Jane Eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today's couple in a Starbucks caf&eacute;. Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure, but at least it is an inoffensive one, which is more than one can say of the '97 and 2006 adaptations. I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation: You will not find Jane Eyre, but at least you will find a beautifully made movie.",2,A glimpse of the novel,1231632000,"01 11,

407654,A15QYCQAHWCJPD,6304211740,"Kalin ""Kalin Jordan""","[3, 3]","The book Jane Eyre was assigned to me this year in 10th grade. It has moved from a homework assignment to my second favorite novel. Our teacher allowed us to view this film in class. In the beginning it is very good, the interpertation of Jane's traumatizing expericence in the red room was very well portrayed.  I believe that the actors were casted very well. Jane, Mr. Rochester, Mrs. Reed, St. John, all looked VERY similar to what I imagined them as. (The only thing that bothered me about Jane Eyre was her teeth. She seemed to have an overbite of somekind and one would think that she has braces or desperatly needs them.) The actors, Jane and Mr. Rochester, made the best out of the script they were given. They were very well paired. I do have several complaints though, I know that one can not transfer a book to film perfectly, but they should follow the story line. (spoiler-if you havn't read the book don't read this) The meeting between Mr. Rochester and Jane when they confess there love is to short and lacks the passionate speach and playfullness that the book has. When Jane is leaving Thornfield catches on fire, this happened later. Also in the film Grace Poole dies, this contradicts the book. Also they don't really explain how she hears his voice and how he heard her calling back- this makes the book seem less gothic. Also in the end Mr. Rochester only regained partial sight in one eye, not all his sight as in the movie. Besides the details the movie is resonable. I have only seen this one, but I have seen the beginning of the older black and white one which looks quite good. This movie is resonable.

The visuals were wonderful, the moodiness was there. What ruined it was William Hurt.. which I hate to say, because he is one of my favorite actors.He was simply mis cast.  It ruined the whole film for me. He simply does not fit Mr Rochester's Torchered,anguished, romantic personality. He was too laid back  and seemed bored with no passion, anger, torture or feeling and did not give the comanding performance that the part needed to have. Charlotte Gainsbourg  who played Jane was okay, but she simply was not Jane.She did not have the very plain yet fairy like qualities so described in the book. She had a long neck of a giraffe, jowls not too unlike Marlon Brando in the Godfather and a lower lip hanging like Buba in Forest Gump.Good to  watch though..... infact I suggest people watch all the many movies and mini series of this famous story.

407656,A3EFDLX43LT7OM,6304211740,Kathryn Atwood,"[7, 12]","I have been a Jane Eyre fan since high school and have seen almost all of the different movie versions. This one is my favorite.  Why?  Most importantly, this is the only Jane Eyre film with a ""plain Jane.""  Her unattractiveness is absolutely fundamental to the story.  The other cinematic Janes, Joan Fontaine and Suzanna York are drop dead gorgeous, Samantha Morton is very pretty and Zelah Clark is cute, chubby and perky, nothing like the ""real"" Jane Eyre of the book.  When this book was published in 1847, it was absolutely unheard of to have a plain heroine, but Charlotte Bronte felt strongly about her heroine's plain looks and the book became a phenomenal best-seller in its day.  Despite plain-Jane's best-seller status, most 20-century film adaptations still can't handle the idea of a plain heroine.  Well, this film can and did!(Charlotte Gainsbourg's performance has been criticized in other Amazon reviews as being less than passioned.  But by the time Jane meets Rochester, her natural passion had been repressed, both by her lengthy austere circumstances and her own strong will.  Her passion therefore, for most of the story is internal.  Charlotte Gainsbourg does a fine job of portraying a Jane Eyre whose turbulent emotions are hidden below a firmly self-controlled surface.)Secondly, the age difference between Rochester and Jane is fully realized in this film.  They are supposed to be 20 years apart.  All the other Jane/Rochester's look like they are approximately the same age, while William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg don't even look like they belong together -- exactly the point of the story.Thirdly, there are a few little scenes and lines straight out of the book that I haven't seen in any other adaptations but this one.  For instance, there is a small but key moment in the book -- Rochester smoking a cigar in the garden just before he declares his love for Jane.  In the book, she smells his cigar and tries to escape before he notices her.  To have William Hurt puffing on a cigar at this point in the film is a nice true-to-the-book touch.  There are many other such incidents and lines in this film that I haven't seen in any other versions and haven't had the pleasure of meeting since I read the book.Of course, given the time limit of this movie, there is some unavoidable tinkering with the plot line.  If you want more of the actual text and plot, get the Timothy Dalton version, but try to keep William Hurt in mind while you watch it. Yes, I know -- he's blond, but he gives an excellent performance.  His good looks are toned down and he manages to be the most compelling Rochester I have yet to see on film.  Timothy Dalton is tolerable in his portrayal but too thin, handsome, and too high strung; his acting is difficult to watch at times. Hurt's portrayal is also far superior to the one actor who has the closest physical resemblence to Rochester -- Orson Welles, whose performance is a string of ridiculous screaming fits.  Watching Cirian Hinds' portrayal is like getting too near a snake pit or a steaming pot of boiling oil; he's way too tortured and it's not a pleasant sight.  Yes, Rochester was a tortured man, but he usually kept it in check and below the surface.  The nuances of this complicated character are lost on most all of the the actors that have attempted to play Rochester; all of the actors that is, except William Hurt who brings to his performance all the irony and subtlty the others are sorely lacking.William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg are as cinematically close as you will get to the physicality of this famous couple of literature.  Although the superiority of this film can be measured by the plainness of it's leading characters, I must conclude by saying that it is beautifully shot and includes a gorgeous soundtrack.",5,Literature's famous couple accurately fleshed out,1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,3809,"['have', 'been', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'fan', 'high', 'school', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'different', 'movie', 'versions', 'one', 'favorite', 'Why', 'Most', 'importantly', 'only', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'film', 'plain', 'Jane', 'unattractiveness', 'absolutely', 'fundamental', 'story', 'other', 'cinematic', 'Janes', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'Suzanna', 'York', 'are', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'very', 'pretty', 'Zelah', 'Clark', 'cute', 'chubby', 'perky', 'nothing', 'real', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'book', 'When', 'book', 'was', 'published', '1847', 'was', 'absolutely', 'unheard', 'have', 'plain', 'heroine', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'felt', 'strongly', 'heroine', 'plain', 'looks', 'book', 'became', 'phenomenal', 'best-seller', 'day', 'plain-Jane', 'best-seller', 'status', 'most', '20-century', 'film', 'adaptations', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'idea', 'plain', 'heroine', 'Well', 'film', 'can', 'did', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'performance', 'been', 'criticized', 'other', 'Amazon', 'being', 'less', 'passioned', 'time', 'Jane', 'meets', 'Rochester', 'natural', 'passion', 'had', 'been', 'repressed', 'lengthy', 'austere', 'circumstances', 'own', 'strong', 'will', 'passion', 'therefore', 'most', 'story', 'internal', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'turbulent', 'emotions', 'are', 'hidden', 'firmly', 'self-controlled', 'surface', 'Secondly', 'age', 'difference', 'Rochester', 'Jane', 'fully', 'realized', 'film', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', '20', 'years', 'apart', 'other', 'Jane/Rochester', 'look', 'are', 'approximately', 'same', 'age', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'belong', 'together', 'exactly', 'point', 'story.Thirdly', 'are', 'few', 'little', 'scenes', 'lines', 'straight', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'adaptations', 'one', 'instance', 'small', 'key', 'moment', 'book', 'Rochester', 'smoking', 'cigar', 'garden', 'just', 'love', 'Jane', 'book', 'cigar', 'tries', 'escape', 'have', 'William', 'Hurt', 'puffing', 'cigar', 'point', 'film', 'nice', 'true-to-the-book', 'touch', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'such', 'incidents', 'lines', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'versions', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'meeting', 'read', 'book.Of', 'course', 'given', 'time', 'limit', 'movie', 'unavoidable', 'tinkering', 'plot', 'line', 'want', 'more', 'actual', 'text', 'plot', 'get', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'version', 'try', 'keep', 'William', 'Hurt', 'mind', 'watch', 'Yes', 'know', 'blond', 'excellent', 'performance', 'good', 'looks', 'are', 'toned', 'down', 'be', 'most', 'compelling', 'Rochester', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'film', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'tolerable', 'portrayal', 'too', 'thin', 'handsome', 'too', 'high', 'strung', 'acting', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'Hurt', 'portrayal', 'also', 'far', 'superior', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'closest', 'physical', 'resemblence', 'Rochester', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'performance', 'string', 'ridiculous', 'screaming', 'fits', 'Watching', 'Cirian', 'Hinds', 'portrayal', 'getting', 'too', 'snake', 'pit', 'steaming', 'pot', 'boiling', 'oil', 'way', 'too', 'tortured', 'not', 'pleasant', 'sight', 'Yes', 'Rochester', 'was', 'tortured', 'man', 'usually', 'kept', 'check', 'surface', 'nuances', 'complicated', 'character', 'are', 'lost', 'most', 'actors', 'have', 'attempted', 'play', 'Rochester', 'actors', 'William', 'Hurt', 'who', 'performance', 'irony', 'subtlty', 'others', 'are', 'sorely', 'lacking.William', 'Hurt', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'are', 'cinematically', 'close', 'will', 'get', 'physicality', 'famous', 'couple', 'literature', 'superiority', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'measured', 'plainness', 'leading', 'characters', 'must', 'conclude', 'saying', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'gorgeous', 'soundtrack']",Jane Eyre VHS

407658,A28QU1UG32PYNV,6304211740,"Katie A. E. ""Words-at-war""","[4, 5]","The story of Jane Eyre is classic, the tale of a young girl harassed by relatives, sent away to a harsh boarding school but manages to retain her sense of spirit, identity and independence as she grows up, is both harrowing but uplifting. Jane is not bitter about her circumstances. She is wise enough, even from a young age, to understand how things work and not embittered as a result. She grows up strong and fine, emotionally muted but not without her hopes and dreams. In Mr. Rochester, tempestuous, frustrated and trapped, does she find all that she's been seeking, and in Jane, does Mr. Rochester may truly find solace, but in the end, to heart breaking results.Jane Eyre is one of my all time favorite novels and the various adaptations have always left me wanting. The most recent, and modern, version,Jane Eyre, from 2011 was an interesting albeit stilted addition to the Jane Eyre Movie Oeuvre but then I came across this older version, which delighted me. This version has the feel and restrained emotion that is present in the book. Of yearning and that touch and go between Jane and Edward that was so palpable and tangible though always slightly removed, as though Bronte wanted us to be close, on bated breath, but not too close. The 2011 version has that same sustained angst and yearning, its telling is still very choppy but the interplay between Wasikowska and Fassbender is riveting. The trick, becomes, how to play two desperate beings as one and every adaptation has its own interpretation and that's what's fascinating.I've seen other versions:Jane Eyre(1983, 11-episodes!), which was very low budget, almost theater-like but the mood/tone of the book is present, the 1997Jane Eyreversion with Ciaran Hinds and disliked by most, theMasterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre(2006) version that had more misses than hits and deviated too much from the book, while the 2011 version was more flash than content, too short and not as satisfying, though none are by any means insufficient. I enjoyed all the versions and all had their flaws and wonderful moments. For some reason, I've always passed on this version. Mainly because I didn't envision William Hurt as the ideal Mr. Rochester, nor Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane.However, Hurt was controlled and perfectly on pitch, both explosive when needed and quietly aching when appropriate, though granted, not the Rochester usually so fiercely depicted. Gainsbourg was quite good, elegant and graceful, ethereal and haunting, yet ever so present but most importantly, exactly precise in her rendering of Jane, maintaining that poise and subdued emotions on the brink of erupting. Some while find this version too restrained and subdued, that the chemistry between Hurt and Gainsbourg is lacking. I didn't mind that interpretation and I loved the interplay between Hurt and Gainsbourg, who used their bodies and facial expressions to convey their feelings for one another. In the book, there is this sense that, from Bronte, the relationship and intimacy of Rochester and Jane is entirely their own, that the audience doesn't ever truly participate but watch from afar, as pure observers. In this version, the director does exactly that and it's so much more powerful. It's not too much acting or costuming or production though the editing was a bit pitchy at parts. Ultimately, this is a movie that needs to be watched a few times to really appreciate the actors portrayals of Jane and Mr. Rochestor, not just the primary ones but the secondary cast that brought more credibility to the overall feel and presentation of the story.

407659,A3G9ZU35JDFO4Y,6304211740,"KN ""Love things and stuff!""","[2, 2]","TO be fair, there have been so many cinematic representations of this movie that no doubt, one will rise above another in any circumstance of interpretation. However, this one left me wanting for the passionate, well developed relationship between Edward and Jane that the Samantha Morton version presented.I could not engage my emotions into their relationship as I did with the former version. In that, the talks between Edward and Jane were what contributed to their union of soul and mind. This is why Jane was so tormented upon learning of Rochester's married state. Her love for him was so well developed in her sense of equality with him, no doubt the first time she felt that her station was no longer a barrier between her and love. In the William Hurt version, there was little to explain why Rochester was so impassioned by Jane. So little attention was given to the development of their love.When she left, where was the passion of soul that Jane experienced? The tension of virtuous justice vs. immoral conduct?To it's credit, this version did offer some key insight into other areas. I appreciated the relationship between young Jane and Helen in the school. Her integrity and faithful friendship in the hair cutting scene. Loved it. Also included was the death bed encounter with her Aunt. This is a key and critical insight into Jane's character lacking in the Morton version.I could not understand in the Morton version why Jane had such a time waking Rochester in the fire. This version lent credibility to why it was difficult to awaken him.I do agree that the Dalton version of Jane Eyre offers the most concise telling of the story of Jane. To it's discredit, however, it is visually and relationally dull. The cinematography as though seen through the lens of a early day video camera.The cinematography in this version is very beautiful. Great care was taken to scenery and authenticity of the time.My wish? That eventually a version of Jane Eyre will be tended to with great care, and envelope ALL the wonderful attributes of each version currently available for viewing. But sadly, I doubt that this will ever occur. I believe if one desires to grasp the heart of Jane Eyre, one must but read the book, in which all questions will be answered, and all intent of the author will be found.In my humble opinion!",3,Left me wanting,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,2333,"['be', 'fair', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'cinematic', 'representations', 'movie', 'doubt', 'one', 'will', 'rise', 'circumstance', 'interpretation', 'However', 'one', 'left', 'wanting', 'passionate', 'well', 'developed', 'relationship', 'Edward', 'Jane', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'version', 'presented.I', 'could', 'not', 'engage', 'emotions', 'relationship', 'did', 'former', 'version', 'talks', 'Edward', 'Jane', 'were', 'what', 'contributed', 'union', 'soul', 'mind', 'why', 'Jane', 'was', 'so', 'tormented', 'learning', 'Rochester', 'married', 'state', 'love', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'developed', 'sense', 'equality', 'doubt', 'first', 'time', 'felt', 'station', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'barrier', 'love', 'William', 'Hurt', 'version', 'was', 'little', 'explain', 'why', 'Rochester', 'was', 'so', 'impassioned', 'Jane', 'So', 'little', 'attention', 'was', 'given', 'development', 'love.When', 'left', 'where', 'was', 'passion', 'soul', 'Jane', 'experienced', 'tension', 'virtuous', 'justice', 'vs.', 'immoral', 'conduct', 'credit', 'version', 'did', 'offer', 'key', 'insight', 'other', 'areas', 'appreciated', 'relationship', 'young', 'Jane', 'Helen', 'school', 'integrity', 'faithful', 'friendship', 'hair', 'cutting', 'scene', 'Loved', 'Also', 'included', 'was', 'death', 'bed', 'encounter', 'Aunt', 'key', 'critical', 'insight', 'Jane', 'character', 'lacking', 'Morton', 'version.I', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'Morton', 'version', 'why', 'Jane', 'had', 'time', 'waking', 'Rochester', 'fire', 'version', 'lent', 'credibility', 'why', 'was', 'difficult', 'awaken', 'him.I', 'do', 'agree', 'Dalton', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'most', 'concise', 'telling', 'story', 'Jane', 'discredit', 'however', 'visually', 'relationally', 'dull', 'cinematography', 'seen', 'lens', 'early', 'day', 'camera.The', 'cinematography', 'version', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Great', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'scenery', 'authenticity', 'time.My', 'wish', 'eventually', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'will', 'be', 'tended', 'great', 'care', 'envelope', 'wonderful', 'attributes', 'version', 'currently', 'available', 'viewing', 'sadly', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'occur', 'believe', 'one', 'grasp', 'heart', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'one', 'must', 'read', 'book', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'answered', 'intent', 'author', 'will', 'be', 'found.In', 'humble', 'opinion']",Jane Eyre VHS
407660,A2VMVTDYQDA6L8,6304211740,Laura Knight-Jadczyk,"[20, 23]","I'd better confess that I'm a Jane Eyre fan since I was a child, having read the book several times.  I can practically recite passages by heart.  I have a small collection of every version of this story I have found.  I keep hoping that I will find the right combination of actors and script... I'm still waiting.Zeffirelli obviously had some money to spend on this production, and managed to get some very good people to play the respective parts - they LOOKED like they were supposed to look - but even all dressed up in good costumes with great cinematography, the movie doesn't go where it should.Of course, it would be impossible to condense Bronte's novel into 2 hours and convey the stark psychological drama that is the major theme of the work.  The script is actually well done all things considered.  A friend who watched it with me and didn't know the book liked it well enough.  But there was a sad lack of passion in the grown up Jane and William Hurt just wasn't rakish enough.I was also very disappointed with the ""meet the mad wife"" scene.  I don't think I have ever seen this rendered as it ought to be, a descent into Hell and damnation and horror.  Zeffirelli's  rendering was even weaker than others.  I suppose that the madness was supposed to be conveyed in the eyes or something, but it was lost on me just like Jane's passion and Rochester's recklessness was so absent due to under-acting.As I said, Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt really looked the parts, they just weren't up to playing them.  Probably the best acting in the whole movie was by Geraldine Chaplin as Miss Scatcherd at Lowood school and John Wood as Mr. Brocklehurst.

407662,AD2BIAIH78QI5,6304211740,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[2, 4]","That simple remark of mine was all I had to say when my friend Norma wanted to know why I didn't like this version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, which she was preparing to see herself. &quot;What kind of comment is that?&quot; she had to ask. But once she had seen it, she understood.Ever read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;? Jane is a small insignificant-looking person who conceals a tumult of emotion smoldering within. She used to be a real wildcat when her aunt was raising her, but when Jane got shipped off to Lowood, an awful boarding school, she met up with two individuals who tamed her. One was a fellow student Helen, and the other was a favorite teacher, Miss Temple. So Jane adopted a quiet mien, but inside was still the tumultuous nature. She lets it out again only once, when her new employer Mr. Rochester plays with her emotions, pretending to be engaged to the wealthy Blanche Ingram when all along it's Jane he is going to propose to. She rages and storms about how she has a heart as great as his, even if she is only a little governess. Since he's a  raging and storming guy himself, this is language he understands.Well anyway, this Jane is usually hard to convey in a movie. The latest A&amp;E version is just awful; that Jane just thought she was all that. She didn't even act like she had an employer, which is very untrue to the book. Joan Fontaine did a convincing job of acting like she was a working girl having to answer to higher-ups, but lacked passion. However, she did convey littleness and insignificance. Now THIS Jane, at a height close to Mr. Hurt's, couldn't convey anything except monumentality. She was just much too tall! How could such a tall woman ever feel insecure? She didn't convey those feelings, and she must on some level. Actually, they had a good candidate for Jane in the movie, and let her slip by them; the actress Amanda Root (of &quot;Persuasion&quot; fame) plays Miss Temple. She really would've been marvelous. I suppose they felt her too old already for the part, but I would've forgiven her that for everything else I know she'd have brought to the role.Other things I found wanting concerned the lighting. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a great Gothic romance, and Gothic romances are usually in dark places. This version had far too much light and lots of pretty garden strolls; not authentic in feeling. William Hurt is too amiable and blond for the brooding, dark, antisocial Rochester. And what about Joan Plowright's Mrs. Fairfax? Did she have a large percentage or something? I ask because every time I looked, there was some sort of slave camera shooting her reaction to whatever was going on. You'd have thought she was the protagonist, and not the governess. One thing she learned from her late husband Laurence Olivier was how to ham up a scene if necessary.So, another disappointing &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; for the records. Perhaps one day, the perfect Jane will dawn on the horizon, but until then, make do with Joan Fontaine.",2,&quot;She's Too Tall&quot;,1023926400,"06 13, 2002",2002,2982,"['simple', 'remark', 'mine', 'was', 'had', 'say', 'when', 'friend', 'Norma', 'wanted', 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'version', 'quot', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'quot', 'was', 'preparing', 'see', 'quot', 'What', 'kind', 'comment', 'quot', 'had', 'ask', 'once', 'had', 'seen', 'understood.Ever', 'read', 'quot', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'quot', 'Jane', 'small', 'insignificant-looking', 'person', 'who', 'tumult', 'emotion', 'smoldering', 'used', 'be', 'real', 'wildcat', 'when', 'aunt', 'was', 'raising', 'when', 'Jane', 'got', 'shipped', 'Lowood', 'awful', 'boarding', 'school', 'met', 'up', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'tamed', 'One', 'was', 'fellow', 'student', 'Helen', 'other', 'was', 'favorite', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Temple', 'So', 'Jane', 'adopted', 'quiet', 'mien', 'inside', 'was', 'still', 'tumultuous', 'nature', 'out', 'again', 'only', 'once', 'when', 'new', 'employer', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'emotions', 'pretending', 'be', 'engaged', 'wealthy', 'Blanche', 'Ingram', 'when', 'Jane', 'going', 'propose', 'storms', 'how', 'heart', 'as', 'great', 'even', 'only', 'little', 'governess', 'raging', 'storming', 'guy', 'language', 'anyway', 'Jane', 'usually', 'hard', 'convey', 'movie', 'latest', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'version', 'just', 'awful', 'Jane', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'act', 'had', 'employer', 'very', 'untrue', 'book', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'did', 'convincing', 'job', 'acting', 'was', 'working', 'girl', 'having', 'answer', 'higher-ups', 'lacked', 'passion', 'However', 'did', 'convey', 'littleness', 'insignificance', 'Now', 'THIS', 'Jane', 'height', 'close', 'Mr.', 'Hurt', 'could', ""n't"", 'convey', 'anything', 'monumentality', 'was', 'just', 'much', 'too', 'tall', 'How', 'could', 'such', 'tall', 'woman', 'ever', 'feel', 'insecure', 'did', ""n't"", 'convey', 'feelings', 'must', 'level', 'Actually', 'had', 'good', 'candidate', 'Jane', 'movie', 'let', 'slip', 'actress', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'fame', 'Miss', 'Temple', 'really', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'marvelous', 'suppose', 'felt', 'too', 'old', 'already', 'part', 'would', ""'ve"", 'forgiven', 'everything', 'else', 'know', ""'d"", 'have', 'brought', 'role.Other', 'things', 'found', 'wanting', 'concerned', 'lighting', 'quot', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'quot', 'great', 'Gothic', 'romance', 'Gothic', 'romances', 'are', 'usually', 'dark', 'places', 'version', 'had', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'light', 'lots', 'pretty', 'garden', 'strolls', 'not', 'authentic', 'feeling', 'William', 'Hurt', 'too', 'amiable', 'blond', 'brooding', 'dark', 'antisocial', 'Rochester', 'what', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'Mrs.', 'Fairfax', 'Did', 'have', 'large', 'percentage', 'something', 'ask', 'time', 'looked', 'was', 'sort', 'slave', 'camera', 'shooting', 'reaction', 'was', 'going', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'protagonist', 'not', 'governess', 'One', 'thing', 'learned', 'late', 'husband', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'was', 'how', 'ham', 'up', 'scene', 'necessary.So', 'disappointing', 'quot', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'quot', 'records', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'perfect', 'Jane', 'will', 'dawn', 'horizon', 'then', 'make', 'do', 'Joan', 'Fontaine']",Jane Eyre VHS

I have read Jane Eyre through many times, and having read it so many times I had extremely high expectations when I viewed this.  The question remains:  Is it possible to make a decent version of Jane Eyre without making a four hour movie?  This one sure tries...Surprisingly, William Hurt does do Mr. Rochester justice.  I say surprisingly because Mr. Rochester is one of those unattractive and unsympathetic characters that is hard to love, but you love him anyway.  Although William Hurt is not physically unattractive as the Mr. Rochester in the book is, he still projects himself in the way that Mr. Rochester does in the book.  The French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg does a surprisingly good job as Jane Eyre.  She is generally the plainest looking Jane I have seen yet in a movie adaptation and gets her quiet penseive manner down quite well.The main problem I have with this movie (which is the same qualm I had about the new ""Pride and Prejudice"") is that it is such a short movie that it feels like a summary of the events rather than an actual story.  It just seems to hop along from one part of Jane's life to the next without much explanation and things fall in to place far to easily.  In the book Jane is always struggling, and struggling to keep her purity, which is why she initially rejects Mr. Rochester.  It fails to catch the nuances of the book and had they made it a three hour film, it would have come much closer to the spirit of the book.  A better, but still short version to try is the 1940's version with Orson Welle's as Mr. Rochester and Joan Fontaine as Jane Eyre.  This version keeps much closer to the spirit of the book, even if it isn't completely faithful.God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy",3,"An average adaption of ""Jane Eyre""...",1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,1896,"['am', 'avid', 'fan', 'William', 'Hurt', 'will', 'watch', 'anything', 'exception', 'movies', 'nudity', 'sex', 'even', 'movie', 'not', 'well-done', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'have', 'read', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'many', 'times', 'having', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'extremely', 'high', 'expectations', 'when', 'viewed', 'question', 'possible', 'make', 'decent', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'making', 'four', 'hour', 'movie', 'one', 'sure', 'tries', 'Surprisingly', 'William', 'Hurt', 'do', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'justice', 'say', 'surprisingly', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'one', 'unattractive', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'hard', 'love', 'love', 'anyway', 'William', 'Hurt', 'not', 'physically', 'unattractive', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'book', 'still', 'projects', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'book', 'French', 'actress', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'job', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'generally', 'plainest', 'looking', 'Jane', 'have', 'seen', 'yet', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'quiet', 'penseive', 'manner', 'down', 'quite', 'well.The', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'same', 'qualm', 'had', 'new', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'such', 'short', 'movie', 'summary', 'events', 'rather', 'actual', 'story', 'just', 'hop', 'along', 'one', 'part', 'Jane', 'life', 'next', 'much', 'explanation', 'things', 'fall', 'place', 'far', 'easily', 'book', 'Jane', 'always', 'struggling', 'struggling', 'keep', 'purity', 'why', 'initially', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'catch', 'nuances', 'book', 'had', 'made', 'three', 'hour', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'much', 'closer', 'spirit', 'book', 'better', 'still', 'short', 'version', 'try', '1940', 'version', 'Orson', 'Welle', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'version', 'much', 'closer', 'spirit', 'book', 'even', ""n't"", 'completely', 'faithful.God', 'Bless', '*enjoy*', '~Amy']",Jane Eyre VHS

The older Jane had a sense of quiet intelligence and a gentle strength that gave her a certain charm. The man playing Rochester did quite a good job as well although it wasn't visually. I loved how he acted it, if only they could place his talent into another body. The scenery was gorgeous, just as I might have imagined it. It adheres to the story MOSTLY (the parts it did tell, that is). The music was astounding as well. Now, for the cons of this movie. First of all, it just simply left out SO MUCH of the story for it to be impactful! It also changed so much after Jane left Rochester to something less dreary than what really happened to her.

Jane's childhood is, granted, done pretty well. But every single change made to the original (and there are tons) makes the movie that much worse and is an attempt to mass market the sensational parts of the story and downplay the intellect.

Barone,"[5, 6]","Jane Eyre is by far the most modern and cinematic of the Great Eight novels by the ""Austen/Bronte Team"" simply because it boasts a woman protagonist who never leaves center stage, who has the grit, complexity, intelligence, and character to infuse any length movie with utterly fascinating rhythms. This movie seizes on one of those chords and strums it relentlessly. The result is a pretty good souffle but one that's missing a few key ingredients.Anna Paquin as the young Jane is surprisingly emotionless and squinty; she makes clear that the film will keep Jane's passion out of the mix. We will get all the stoicism and forbearance imaginable. This Jane Eyre is a saint, one who endures all, overcomes all, and forgives all. She laughs only once when the young executor of her estate chases his wind-blown hat.She falls in love with the self-centered and distractingly irritable William Hurt as Mr. Rochester as the result, it seems, of a handshake, and the movie is at great pains to convey the fact of her lovesickness in every scene thereafter.Charlotte Gainsbourg, the adult Jane, is visually astonishing. She is at turns homely and forlorn, then radiant and winning.

407673,A3N9TC5EOJZVTP,6304211740,"Neci ""dzoldos_99""","[3, 4]","Wow - this was the blandest version of Jane Eyre I have ever seen. After watching Jane Eyre with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson this was a complete and total let down.Let's start with the performances.  William Hurt was just so awful - his portrayal was downright creepy.  The scene where he is declaring his love for Jane he is sitting down not even bothering to look at her. I could barely stand to watch him with his head down and his eyes looking up - he looked so grotesque.  No passion, no power - Frankenstein could have brought more fire to the role.Charlotte Gainsborough couldn't be bothered to put any inflection into her voice- no passion - no emotion - nothing.  She was - sorry there is no other word but - ""blah"" to accurately describe her.  Jane is all about passion but Charlotte's performance lacked anything that remotely resembled emotion.  You don't get so much as a smirk on her face at any given time.I didn't even like the two of them as a couple - I saw no discernable electricity or chemistry or fire probably because they were both decided to play their parts so flat and lifeless.To top it all off they took some liberties with the plot probably in the interest of brevity.  I can handle this but their choices to do this were odd.  For instance: they cut out one sister of St John (not sure why - she wouldn't have taken up any extra time) Jane arrives back at Gateshead for a 2nd time???  She first meets St John at Gateshead?  All of it untrue and perplexing - why change these things?Don't watch this version - save yourself some time - you'll never get those 112 minutes back.",2,Could someone put a little inflection into their voice?,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,1608,"['Wow', 'was', 'blandest', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'watching', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'was', 'complete', 'total', 'let', 'down.Let', 'start', 'performances', 'William', 'Hurt', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'awful', 'portrayal', 'was', 'downright', 'creepy', 'scene', 'where', 'declaring', 'love', 'Jane', 'sitting', 'down', 'not', 'even', 'bothering', 'look', 'could', 'barely', 'stand', 'watch', 'head', 'down', 'eyes', 'looking', 'up', 'looked', 'so', 'grotesque', 'passion', 'power', 'Frankenstein', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'more', 'fire', 'role.Charlotte', 'Gainsborough', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'put', 'inflection', 'voice-', 'passion', 'emotion', 'nothing', 'was', 'sorry', 'other', 'word', 'blah', 'accurately', 'describe', 'Jane', 'passion', 'Charlotte', 'performance', 'lacked', 'anything', 'remotely', 'resembled', 'emotion', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'so', 'much', 'smirk', 'face', 'given', 'time.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'two', 'couple', 'saw', 'discernable', 'electricity', 'chemistry', 'fire', 'probably', 'were', 'decided', 'play', 'parts', 'so', 'flat', 'lifeless.To', 'top', 'took', 'liberties', 'plot', 'probably', 'interest', 'brevity', 'can', 'handle', 'choices', 'do', 'were', 'odd', 'instance', 'cut', 'out', 'one', 'sister', 'St', 'John', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'extra', 'time', 'Jane', 'back', 'Gateshead', '2nd', 'time', 'first', 'St', 'John', 'Gateshead', 'untrue', 'perplexing', 'why', 'change', 'things', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'version', 'save', 'time', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', '112', 'minutes', 'back']",Jane Eyre VHS
407674,A24JMUNUOVABHP,6304211740,NovelReader,"[3, 7]","As someone who has both read the book and also watched 4 different adaptations at this point (this one, and the Samantha Morton, Timothy Dalton, and Welles/Fontaine versions), I can say definitively than none of them is genuinely ""true"" to the book.  But that should not be a surprise to anyone.  How do you take a book that is told in the first person, with Jane as our narrator, and expect things NOT to change the moment the camera forces you to the cool distance of third-person storytelling?  The Dalton version comes closest to a literal scene-by-scene reenactment, but it fails (in my opinion) largely because of the wooden performance of Zelah Clarke, who is the wall you see Timothy Dalton talking to.  And how true is it to the book to have Timothy Dalton simply sitting there staring, for what seems like an eternity, at the pivotal moment his ""Jane"" is purportedly bearing her soul to him?This film, like the other three non-Dalton versions, strays far from the book's storyline in at least one significant way. (I know other reviewers seem to think the characters' heights and hair colors are ""significant"", but personally I mean only the highly altered St. John Rivers part of the story).  That story change is truly annoying just because it makes no sense--Jane wouldn't run away to Gateshead Hall, because it would be the first place Rochester would look for her.  But let's remember that Bronte's actual story also strains credulity here:  in the novel, Jane runs off to God-Knows-Where, and preposterously (though conveniently) ends up at her first cousins' house.We forgive the book for that, because the point of the book lies not there, but in its dealing with the interplay between love and the social code.  Morality and responsibility without love at worst results in Brocklehurst and Aunt Reed, and at best only in the cool proposals of Rivers that are based more on duty than on affection.  But (the story tells us) you can't just follow love without any regard for anything else, which is what Rochester would propose.  Jane's quest is to find love that does not conflict with virtue and duty, and the reason I like this film version is that I believe it best captures, in Jane's face, the perils of her quest.  The beauty of this version, despite its annoying St. John Rivers' variation, lies in the chemistry between the youthful Gainsbourg and the older William Hurt.  Of all the versions I've seen, this is the one where the performances come closest to evoking the characters' relationship in the novel, and the balancing act they play between their duties to others and society and their love and regard for each other.  Yes, there are departures, but the emotional core is there, every time Hurt and Gainsbourg appear together on the screen.  Fastforward through the Rivers portion if you must (and I do, sometimes) but don't pass this up just because of it.",4,No Film is like the Book,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,2892,"['someone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'also', 'watched', '4', 'different', 'adaptations', 'point', 'one', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Welles/Fontaine', 'versions', 'can', 'say', 'definitively', 'none', 'genuinely', 'true', 'book', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'How', 'do', 'take', 'book', 'told', 'first', 'person', 'Jane', 'narrator', 'expect', 'things', 'NOT', 'change', 'moment', 'camera', 'cool', 'distance', 'third-person', 'storytelling', 'Dalton', 'version', 'closest', 'literal', 'scene-by-scene', 'reenactment', 'opinion', 'largely', 'wooden', 'performance', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'who', 'wall', 'see', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'talking', 'how', 'true', 'book', 'have', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'simply', 'sitting', 'there', 'staring', 'what', 'eternity', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'Jane', 'purportedly', 'bearing', 'soul', 'film', 'other', 'three', 'non-Dalton', 'versions', 'strays', 'far', 'book', 'storyline', 'least', 'one', 'significant', 'way', 'know', 'other', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'think', 'characters', 'heights', 'hair', 'colors', 'are', 'significant', 'personally', 'mean', 'only', 'highly', 'altered', 'St.', 'John', 'Rivers', 'part', 'story', 'story', 'change', 'truly', 'annoying', 'just', 'sense', 'Jane', 'would', ""n't"", 'run', 'away', 'Gateshead', 'Hall', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'place', 'Rochester', 'would', 'look', 'let', 'remember', 'Bronte', 'actual', 'story', 'also', 'credulity', 'here', 'novel', 'Jane', 'God-Knows-Where', 'preposterously', 'conveniently', 'up', 'first', 'cousins', 'house.We', 'forgive', 'book', 'point', 'book', 'not', 'there', 'dealing', 'interplay', 'love', 'social', 'code', 'Morality', 'responsibility', 'love', 'worst', 'results', 'Brocklehurst', 'Aunt', 'Reed', 'best', 'only', 'cool', 'proposals', 'Rivers', 'are', 'based', 'more', 'duty', 'affection', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'follow', 'love', 'regard', 'anything', 'else', 'what', 'Rochester', 'would', 'propose', 'Jane', 'quest', 'find', 'love', 'not', 'conflict', 'virtue', 'duty', 'reason', 'film', 'version', 'believe', 'best', 'captures', 'Jane', 'face', 'perils', 'quest', 'beauty', 'version', 'annoying', 'St.', 'John', 'Rivers', 'variation', 'chemistry', 'youthful', 'Gainsbourg', 'older', 'William', 'Hurt', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'where', 'performances', 'come', 'closest', 'evoking', 'characters', 'relationship', 'novel', 'balancing', 'act', 'play', 'duties', 'others', 'society', 'love', 'regard', 'other', 'Yes', 'are', 'departures', 'emotional', 'core', 'there', 'time', 'Hurt', 'Gainsbourg', 'appear', 'together', 'screen', 'Fastforward', 'Rivers', 'portion', 'must', 'do', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'just']",Jane Eyre VHS

Also I understand that every director and script writer has his/her own interpretation of a book. But it does not justify the cutting to pieces of the main story, juggling with the characters in the book, leaving out three quarters of the story and changing plotlines so much that if this movie had not been called Jane Eyre, I would hardly have recognized it.Now for the actors, I think there were some serious miscasts here. Gainsbourgh is a very romantic Jane, nothing of the passion a Jane Eyre should have, nothing intelligent.William Hurt I really loved in the Big Chill, but this was the worst miscast. He does not seem at ease with the role and was just too sad and too romantic, nothing exacting or fastidious. I always imagined Rochester as a little bit sad but also angry at fate and life in general.The two stars are for the filmic qualities and the music.

Jane is not glamorous. However, the girl's widower, father notices Jane's goodness.The film holds your attention. Filmed on location. Nice sets and costumes. The relationships are believable. This version moves at a better pace than other versions.The 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson is a good version too. Its slow pace is redeemed by some excellent scenes. In the 2007 version; Jane has some charm and personality. Both Jane and Rochester are likeable. Women viewers will love the romance of the Masterpiece Theatre version.The 1944 black & white version begins promising during Jane's childhood, because the headmaster is a true villain and Jane wins our sympathy. However, Jane's childhood is a brief part of the film. The main story of Jane's adult life centers on her relationship with Rochester. Orson Welles' Rochester is so harsh and unlikeable without any redeeming qualities that it is not believable Jane would like him. Rochester's house may be historically accurate, but it is so dark and dreary, with no daytime scenes of light to give any hope, that viewers are overwhelmed with depression.The 1-star reviews of this 1996 version are all by people who have read the book. If you have not read the book; you will like this. Two people can read the same book and imagine very different characters. A reader with a vivid imagination will always imagine something better than any movie can reproduce. What this movie does; it does well. There is more of the story to be told in future versions.

You could easily see the growing admiration and love between the two main characters. &#34;Jane&#34; was sufficiently young and naive to see the huge disparity in their natures, stations in life, and experience.

This movie is one of the most beautiful to me, with the breathtaking surrounding lands of Thornfield, and then Thornfield itself is so beautiful, and I so dearly loved the beautiful rooms of Thornfield, and Jane's, Aunt Reed's house, and I loved the costumes in the movie! And I dearly love movies with beautiful horses, and carriages! This movie was very well done!I loved all the actors, and I loved William Hurt as Mr. Rochester, and I loved the young Jane Eyre, and the young girl who played Helen Burns with the beautiful red hair, they were outstanding!The tall and graceful, young woman who played Jane Eyre had a shy and quiet, and guarded manner that I liked, it matched William Hurt's Edward Rochester, which was brooding, and bitter and guarded and moody!This is the timeless and beloved classic love story, about a unwanted and unloved little girl named Jane Eyre, who becomes a orphan, and she grows into a young woman who yearns to escape the strict confines of Lowood school to have a life of her own. So she advertises, and gets a job as a governess to a pretty little girl named Adele, at the grand estate of Thornfield. (this Adele is one of my favorite Jane Eyre movie Adele's ) Adele is Mr. Edward Rochester's ward.Edward is the master of Thornfield. Edward has traveled around the world trying to escape from Thornfield and so, he hardly ever visits or stays at Thornfield, because of the painful memories of his past ,but when Edward meets Jane, all that changes forever, because Jane and Edward fall inlove with each other, but a hidden and a very dangerous secret, threatens their happiness!If you love classic love stories ,then this is for you, I so dearly love all these movie versions of Jane Eyre!

I can't quibble too strongly with this adaptation, except in one major detail.William Hurt's performance as Rochester is one of the weirdest, and worst, ever put on film.  He plays the role as if Rochester was afflicted with narcolepsy, and is having an especially hard time staying awake.  Hurt's characteristic mumbling and bizarre attempt at an English accent don't help matters much.  I don't see what on earth possesses even that poor governess Jane Eyre to find him even at all attractive.  Weren't there any hunky stableboys she could be dallying with?There's a far more effective version starring George C.

407689,A3ITL5EYKTZTF0,6304211740,Tracy Marks,"[12, 15]","After reading the book Jane Eyre, I decided to watch every remake of the film that I could find - at least half a dozen. By far the best is the newest one with Rochester as Toby Stephens (what a marvelous flirtatious exchange between Rochester and Jane); another favorite is the Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke production. But this one with William Hurt (who I always liked as an actor) is so bad that it makes me cringe.There is absolutely no chemistry or romance conveyed between Charlotte Gainsborgh and William Hurt; I could not feel or believe that they loved each other. The performances of both fall flat, flat, flat. I find myself even wondering if the two actors did not even like each other or connect in real life but felt compelled, due to signing their contracts, to play the role of lovers. But neither succeeded in summoning up any real feeling - it just doesn't work!Joan Plowright is excellent as always, and Charlotte Gainsborgh does make a believable Jane Eyre, but there is no real fire in her, and as a result her outspoken moments feel heavy, as if she were depressed and exhausted and pretending to an energy she does not possess.Another complaint about the film, probably not obvious to those who haven't read the book, is that the story is distorted and about 1/3 of it omitted. What happened to Jane's fleeing of Rochester and landing at the home of strangers whom take her in and with whom she lives for half a year? Perhaps because of time limitations, Sintjen's role was altered in this film, and the fire was portrayed as Jane was leaving Rochester, and not many months later.In any case, if you're going to watch one version of Jane Eyre, I highly suggest it not be this one!",2,The worst Jane Eyre remake,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,1706,"['reading', 'book', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'decided', 'watch', 'remake', 'film', 'could', 'find', 'least', 'dozen', 'far', 'best', 'newest', 'one', 'Rochester', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'what', 'marvelous', 'flirtatious', 'exchange', 'Rochester', 'Jane', 'favorite', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'production', 'one', 'William', 'Hurt', 'who', 'always', 'liked', 'actor', 'so', 'bad', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'romance', 'conveyed', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsborgh', 'William', 'Hurt', 'could', 'not', 'feel', 'believe', 'loved', 'other', 'performances', 'fall', 'flat', 'flat', 'flat', 'find', 'even', 'wondering', 'two', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'other', 'connect', 'real', 'life', 'felt', 'compelled', 'due', 'signing', 'contracts', 'play', 'role', 'lovers', 'succeeded', 'summoning', 'up', 'real', 'feeling', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'excellent', 'always', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsborgh', 'make', 'believable', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'real', 'fire', 'result', 'outspoken', 'moments', 'feel', 'heavy', 'were', 'depressed', 'exhausted', 'pretending', 'energy', 'not', 'possess.Another', 'complaint', 'film', 'probably', 'not', 'obvious', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'story', 'distorted', '1/3', 'omitted', 'What', 'happened', 'Jane', 'fleeing', 'Rochester', 'landing', 'home', 'strangers', 'whom', 'take', 'whom', 'year', 'Perhaps', 'time', 'limitations', 'Sintjen', 'role', 'was', 'altered', 'film', 'fire', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Jane', 'was', 'leaving', 'Rochester', 'not', 'many', 'months', 'later.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'one', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'highly', 'suggest', 'not', 'be', 'one']",Jane Eyre VHS

When you are watching it, one feels like they are watching a play. I really did not enjoy it at all.The 1997 A&E; Production was an improvement on the 1983 Production however Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester I did not enjoy. It seemed as many other reviews have commented he spends most of the production yelling and shouting at Jane.But on the other hand Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre was likable. I think the main reason I could'nt come to enjoy and like this version is performance by Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester.Now the 1996 production I enjoyed watching it so much so that I have seen it four times already and I only got the DVD from Amazon on Friday 18th May.Franco Zeffirelli has done a wonderful job. From the cast to the locations to the costumes to the music. Everthing in this version was first rate.I much perfer William Hurt performance as Mr Rochester. One can see that he is not a happy man and he is diffcult to understand but he does not spend the whole production yelling or shouting.Anna Paquin is a great talent and she is amazing as the young Jane.Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the adult Jane. From the three versions I have seen her performance was the one I really enjoyed the most and one could sense what she is feeling.One of many scenes that I enjoyed was when Jane goes back to see her Aunt Reed as she is dying and requested to see Jane.Jane offers her Aunt forgivness for all that she has done to her. She pulls away from Jane. Jane then replys ""Love me or Hate me as you will,  you have my Full and Free Forgivness"" What a prowerful message.To the people that have not seen this movie I say make up your own mind about this Production and dont base you decision on other reviews. If I did that I would of missed out on something wonderful.To the people that are looking for family friendly production. This is one of them but I think that your children need to be a certain age before they can watch it.This is a clean movie about Adversaries, Love and Forgivness. I found this Production of Jane Eyre a very lovely sweet movie one that I am happy to have in my own personal collection.I can not recommend this movie highly enough.
