1445414,A19MLRME6H8MTW,B0058WKA6O,"Forrest Bezotte ""Amazon fan""","[0, 0]","This season was...interesting.  The action scenes don't bother me even though rvb used to be strictly comedy or drama with little to no action.  I DO agree with some of the reviewers that says the action was a little too long and that it kinda detracted from the story.  I think we still got some good character development from Church this season.  We also get to hear the Alpha's voice real briefly (if u don't know what that is, watch season 6).  I thought the scenes with the Reds were pointless and did nothing to effect the plot in the end, they're just there and acting a bit different much to Church's dissapointment.  As far as humor goes in this season, it was pretty good, but I didn't feel like there were a lot of laugh out loud moments.  Caboose is still as funny as ever though!One of my characters is Director Church, probably figured that out by the title of my review right?  Am I wrong, or does the director NOT act a lot like the Blue Church despite that the Blue is supposed to be based on him.  I think Burnie Burns does a great job giving each character a different personality and talent (example being that York is an infiltrations specialist but pretty bad at combat), and even the Meta had to be admired somewhat before he turned into a bad guy and all.Anyway, I still like season 8 better, but this one is probably third on the list (season 1 being second)",4,"""Some of these things may be...questionable""-Director Church",1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,1384,"['season', 'was', 'interesting', 'action', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'even', 'rvb', 'used', 'be', 'strictly', 'comedy', 'drama', 'little', 'action', 'DO', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'action', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'kinda', 'detracted', 'story', 'think', 'still', 'got', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'Church', 'season', 'also', 'get', 'hear', 'Alpha', 'voice', 'real', 'briefly', 'u', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'watch', 'season', '6', 'thought', 'scenes', 'Reds', 'were', 'pointless', 'did', 'nothing', 'effect', 'plot', 'end', ""'re"", 'just', 'there', 'acting', 'bit', 'different', 'much', 'Church', 'dissapointment', 'As', 'far', 'humor', 'season', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'were', 'lot', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'Caboose', 'still', 'as', 'funny', 'ever', 'One', 'characters', 'Director', 'Church', 'probably', 'figured', 'out', 'title', 'review', 'right', 'Am', 'wrong', 'director', 'NOT', 'act', 'lot', 'Blue', 'Church', 'Blue', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'think', 'Burnie', 'Burns', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'character', 'different', 'personality', 'talent', 'example', 'being', 'York', 'infiltrations', 'specialist', 'pretty', 'bad', 'combat', 'even', 'Meta', 'had', 'be', 'admired', 'somewhat', 'turned', 'bad', 'guy', 'all.Anyway', 'still', 'season', '8', 'better', 'one', 'probably', 'third', 'list', 'season', '1', 'being', 'second']",Red vs. Blue Season 9

1445421,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0058WKA6O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[15, 15]","With the anniversary release of HALO: Combat Evolved for XBOX 360, the synergistic powers-that-be have also elected to use the same date to drop the DVD release of ""Red vs Blue: Season 9."" It's a big day in the HALO universe! When the Recollection trilogy (seasons 6-8) of ""Red vs Blue"" came to a conclusion with Revelation (season 8), there was a bit of a character cliffhanger. While Season 9 deals specifically with the loose ends of the prior chapter, the structure of the whole piece is considerably different than what we've seen before! It takes a moment to grasp and appreciate this new direction as it isn't instantly clear what's going on (if you have not followed the Red vs Blue saga, I would not necessarily recommend this as the starting point). But once you become accustomed to the style and narrative choices of this season, I think you'll appreciate its complexities. The story unravels on two timelines (one rendered in machinima, one in CGI)--one tells a prequel set before Blood Gulch about Project Freelancer and one is a contemporary continuation of the current plot threads played out as memories of a central character. It took me a bit before I settled into the season, but once it gets going--there is all the action and humor you would expect.Visual: I really thought utilizing two animation styles to represent different eras was a stroke of genius. Technically, it looks terrific (as you would expect)--but the diversity made for a unique storytelling experience. The added dimension really takes the action sequences to new places.Episodes: All twenty episodes are included (running time varies between 4-8 minutes each approximately). (1) Prologue, (2) Rounding Error, (3) The Twins, (4) Number One, (5) Evacuation Plan, (6) Realignment, (7) Familiar Feelings, (8) Case File 01.045, (9) Shaking The Foundation, (10) Captive Audience, (11) Introductions, (12) Lifting the Veil, (13) Mid-Game Substitution, (14) Planning The Heist, (15) Son of a B..., (16) The Sarcophagus, (17) Hell's Angel, (18) Spiral, (19) Labor Pains and (20) Hate To Say Goodbye.Bonus Features: The DVD comes with Director's Commentary, Special videos and PSAs, Outtakes, Deleted scenes, Cast Interviews, Behind-the-Scenes Videos. If you're a fan, it's a nice collection of extras.If you are a ""Red vs Blue"" enthusiast, nothing I can say will change your mind one way or another so go ahead and enjoy. If you are new to the experience, treat yourself and start back with the Blood Gulch Chronicles. You will truly be lost trying to pick up the action here! Is Season 9 the best that ""Red vs Blue"" has to offer? Truthfully, it isn't my favorite when compared to some of the past eight seasons. But it is still the entertaining blend of action mayhem and slapstick humor that you've come to appreciate. I did, however, admire the new direction, overlapping timelines, and contrasting animation styles.
