It was so nice to see Heidi's bio mom so excited and happy to see her long lost daughter after 20 some years.  Then when her brother asked Heidi to help their mother financially, and Heidi's VERY strong reaction, I was so saddened!  And to actually push her bio mom away when she simply wanted to comfort her was so disturbing and cruel.As others have stated, she should have done some research about the culture to better understand what to expect.  Perhaps it is no one's fault that the relationship fell apart, but I still feel that Heidi is just another spoiled Ugly American, raised with a ""Me"" attitude.  I can't understand why she couldn't simply help out by giving even a few dollars a month, anything would help in such a poor country.After all these years, I certainly hope that she has at least tried to do a little research about her mother's culture and be a bit more understanding and altruistic towards the family.

801473,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B0001DMW2A,Chris Luallen,"[8, 8]","Heidi Bub is a young American woman who decides to return to Vietnam to meet with her birth mother, Mai Thi Kim, who gave her up for adoption when Heidi was age 7. Heidi was adopted by a cold hearted American woman who told Heidi she was ""no longer my daughter"" when Heidi came home late from a date. So clearly Heidi is someone with ample reasons to have emotional issues, especially a sense of abandonment.This provides the context for an intercultural mother-daughter reunion that Heidi is completely unprepared for. It's obvious that Heidi experiences severe cultural shock upon her arrival in Vietnam. She also can't deal with what she perceives as her mother's clinging behavior. Heidi says this makes her feel like she is the mother rather than the daughter. It's obvious that her romantic vision of finally having a mother who would take care of and protect her is hopelessly naive.Heidi's final and most intense breakdown occurs when her Vietnamese family makes a very direct request for her to support her mother with a monthly financial stipend. My wife is originally from Ecuador, a country that, like Vietnam, places more emphasis on family obligations and taking care of your elders than the individualistic and youth oriented United States. So she felt a strong emotional connection to the Vietnamese family and become intensely upset with Heidi for what she perceived to be Heidi's extreme greediness and selfishness. I, on the other hand, did feel some sympathy for Heidi's circumstances. She was in a totally diiferent culture with people she hardly knew. She clearly was confused and felt that perhaps her birth mother was only looking for financial assistance rather than love. Heidi was, quite possibly, wrong about her mother's intentions. But none of us were there and I think it's impossible to know the truth of the situation. I recommend reading an earlier review by Song Toan, a Vietnamese woman living in Singapore. She says the Vietnamese family were being totally improper in their requests for money from Heidi. So perhaps this really isn't a case of cultural misunderstanding after all.One of the many great aspects to this documentary is that the film makers remain objective thoroughout and leave it up to the viewer to decide what is truly going on between mother and daughter. This is one of the best and most emotionally powerful docs I have ever seen.

801474,A1ENC0ALMHVBU,B0001DMW2A,"D. HupFons ""Hup234""","[3, 3]","Controversial, enlightening, and emotionally unsettling. This is what you can expect to experience and more, when you watch this extremely well-made documentary.The reunion between mother and daughter after more than 20 years of separation begins as tearfully happy and eventually becomes tearfully unsettling. The film describes how Operation Babylift was created and then shows the consequences of that socio-political program on the lives of a Vietnamese child and her estranged mother 20-plus years later. The child is adopted by a single American mother whom we soon discover emotionally abused the little girl and eventually disowned her. The Vietnamese mother has lived all those years with virtually no knowledge of her daughter. This is the backdrop for the highly charged emotional encounter that plays out in front of the viewer's eyes. It's a raw, emotional roller coaster ride for the family and viewers.I highly recommend this film to those who are willing to grapple with the strong emotions that surround the reunion of an adopted child with the birth parent. The emotions and expectations of all involved are intense. When language and cultural differences are added to such reunions, the emotional stakes become even more highly charged. These are the compelling issues that you can expect to witness and not soon forget when you watch Daughter From Danang.

As she says, she has been ""fully Americanized."" So, when she takes a trip back to Viet Nam to meet her mother for the first time in over 20 years, her initial excitement quickly changes to disgust and anger with her family. They expect her to assume responsibility for taking care of the mother financially and they have a difficult time understanding why this upsets her so much. From her perspective, though, it's like this bunch of total strangers are suddenly trying to scam her out of her money.In looking at some of the other reviews on this page, it's clear that most people watching this movie blame the woman for not making more of an effort to understand her mother. Certainly, it is painful to see how hurt the mother is by her daughter's total rejection of her. But this is a story about two completely different cultures being forced together and I don't think it's entirely fair to blame her. Is she being selfish? Yes. But you have to try to imagine that you're experiencing what she's experiencing and not simply watching it as a viewer. All her life, she's had this image of what her real family would be like and what kind of person her mother was. Plus she's grown up in an incredibly sheltered environment (about half the people in her home town belong to the KKK, to give you an idea of the background she's coming from). How realistic is it to expect her to adapt to the culture of Viet Nam or to accept her family?It's a sad story to be sure, but if you have any interest in cultural issues, this documentary is powerful stuff.",5,Culture Clash,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,1693,"['fascinating', 'documentary', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'was', 'sent', 'mother', 'live', 'US', 'early', 'age', 'been', 'fully', 'Americanized', 'So', 'when', 'trip', 'back', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'meet', 'mother', 'first', 'time', '20', 'years', 'initial', 'excitement', 'quickly', 'changes', 'disgust', 'anger', 'family', 'expect', 'assume', 'responsibility', 'taking', 'care', 'mother', 'financially', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'understanding', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'perspective', 'though', 'bunch', 'total', 'strangers', 'are', 'suddenly', 'trying', 'scam', 'money.In', 'looking', 'other', 'reviews', 'page', 'clear', 'most', 'people', 'watching', 'movie', 'woman', 'not', 'making', 'more', 'effort', 'understand', 'mother', 'Certainly', 'painful', 'see', 'how', 'hurt', 'mother', 'daughter', 'total', 'rejection', 'story', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'cultures', 'being', 'forced', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'entirely', 'fair', 'blame', 'being', 'selfish', 'Yes', 'have', 'try', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'experiencing', 'what', 'experiencing', 'not', 'simply', 'watching', 'viewer', 'life', 'had', 'image', 'what', 'real', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'mother', 'was', 'grown', 'up', 'incredibly', 'sheltered', 'environment', 'people', 'home', 'town', 'belong', 'KKK', 'give', 'idea', 'background', 'coming', 'How', 'realistic', 'expect', 'adapt', 'culture', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'accept', 'family', 'sad', 'story', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'interest', 'cultural', 'issues', 'documentary', 'powerful', 'stuff']",N/A

But, in 1975, Heidi was Hiep, the 7-year old daughter of Mai Thi Kim, a poor Vietnamese woman living in Danang while her husband was off fighting with the Viet Cong. Hiep's biologic father was an American serviceman, with whom Kim had a relationship in order to keep food on her large family's table. When the U.S. forces scurried for home, they took several thousand children of mixed parentage, including Hiep, with them for adoption in the States in Operation Babylift. Hiep was raised in Pulaski, TN as Heidi by a single mother, who convinced the girl to bury her heritage and grow up American. Now, years later, Heidi wishes to discover the identity of her birth mother, much to her foster mother's horror and eventual estrangement. With the help of the original adoption agency, Heidi locates her long-lost family. DAUGHTER FROM DANANG follows Heidi as she travels to Vietnam in 1997 with a Vietnamese social worker, gifts, and good intentions to meet her birth mother and half-siblings.What starts out as an emotional and poignant reunion between Heidi and Kim slides steadily downhill as cultures collide and the collateral damage mounts. As Kim cloyingly attaches herself to her daughter's every movement, one can see troubles ahead. I was irritated that Heidi's Vietnamese travel companion/interpreter apparently didn't give her a clue as to the responsibilities inherent to Vietnamese familial ties, and what might be expected of a perceived-to-be-rich American. By the end of the film, the viewer can only feel profound sympathy for all involved, especially as the initial expectations were so extravagantly high.The history of Kim's family during the Vietnam War is nicely fleshed out with general archival footage of the time and place, e.g. VC on the march, American troops interacting with the locals, the South Vietnamese panic during the U.S. withdrawal, the victorious North Vietnamese forces.Most of the documentary is comprised of interviews with both Kim and Heidi, as well as a visual record of Heidi's one-week interactive visit to her homeland. The repercussions of Heidi's brief sojourn in the Old Country are emphasized by the last sequence of interviews done two years later.While watching DAUGHTER FROM DANANG, several tired-but-true aphorisms came to mind: ""Be careful what you wish for"", ""No good deed goes unpunished"", and ""You can't go home again"".

801478,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0001DMW2A,Lawyeraau,"[17, 26]","This is a interesting and absorbing  documentary that focuses on a very personal memoir that is set against the backdrop of one of the most turbulent episodes  of the latter half of the twentieth century: the Vietnam War. Archival footage of the Vietnam War is interjected in the film to heighten the viewer's awareness and to better ground the film in the context out of which this all too human drama arose.The documentary focuses on Heidi Bub, a woman in her late twenties who more than twenty years ago was airlifted from Vietnam during Operation Babylift when she was seven years old. Heidi, it turns out,  was born Mai Thi Hiep to a Vietnamese mother who had had a fleeting relationship with an American soldier, who was Heidi's biological father. Her mother had formed this liaison after her husband had temporarily abandoned her and their children to fight in the war. Times were hard during the days of the Vietnam War, and she had to do what she needed in order to ensure her survival and that of her children.In the waning days of the war, with the Americans fleeing Vietnam by hook or by crook, Mai Thi Hiep was seven. Her mother despaired of the future of her Amer-Asian child and feared what her husband might do to the child if he were to return home. When she heard about Operation Babylift, she felt that she would be giving her daughter a chance for a better future. So,  Mai Thi Hiep, along with about two thousand other children,  was airlifted to the United States.Mai Thi Hiep  was renamed Heidi and adopted by a troubled, single, white woman in Tennessee who was physically and emotionally abusive to Heidi. She raised Heidi in Pulaski, Tennessee, home of the Klu Klux Klan, and a totally Americanized Heidi, knowing nothing of her cultural roots, became a true Southerner, right down to her soft butter-wouldn't-melt-in-your-mouth Southern drawl. Her adoptive mother ultimately disowned Heidi, when she was a teenager, and they remain estranged. Heidi had virtually no memory of her earlier life in Vietnam or her biological mother, and she grew up thinking that she had been simply abandoned by her.Heidi, now a military wife and mother of two living in Rhode Island, decided that she wanted to find her birth mother, so she traveled to Vietnam in search of her. She found her mother in the poor village of Danang, and a reunion was organized. Unfortunately, the reality of her finding her mother and her half-brothers and half-sisters did not meet  her expectations. Heidi's mother, who had felt great loss over sending her daughter into the unknown all those years ago and had despaired of ever seeing her again, was beside herself with happiness at finding her long lost daughter. Consequently, she wanted to spend a lot of time with Heidi and was very touchy-feely towards her daughter, who disdained the physical contact. A portrait of Heidi is slowly developing, and it is not flattering.Moreover, her Vietnamese family wanted Heidi to help out with the care of their mother. In fact, her mother herself suggested that she go to the United States to live with Heidi. This is much more that Heidi had bargained for, but she reacted badly. In fact, Heidi reacted as if she were a third rate drama queen and is embarrassing to watch. Clearly, there was a conflict between her Vietnamese family's concept of filial love and respect and that of Heidi's. To her Vietnamese family, who are poor and undernourished, Heidi, who could definitely stand to lose quite a few pounds, was well nourished and looked prosperous. Heidi, on the other hand, thought that they wanted her just for what  they thought she could offer them. While Heidi might not be wealthy by American standards, to the Vietnamese she looked as if she could be their ticket out of poverty. Clearly, there was a communication and cultural gap that could not be bridged by Heidi's brief visit.In the film, Heidi Bub comes across as a thoroughly  unlikable, self-absorbed woman, who is little interested in the culture from which she sprang.  It is ironic that this Amer-Asian woman should have returned to the home of her birth and revealed herself to be nothing more than the proverbial ""ugly American"". Although Heidi herself is a mother, she seemed to have little understanding of the sacrifice her biological mother made over twenty years ago. Although she is a college graduate, Heidi also seemed to have little understanding of the dynamics that transpired between herself and her biological family, which is certainly an indictment of the education that she has received. She left Vietnam knowing as little about love, as when she first set foot back in that country. Her Vietnamese family should simply move on and put Heidi on the back burner of their memories. Having met Heidi, they must be aware that this little ice queen will have done just that with respect to them.",5,BLOOD IS NOT ALWAYS THICKER THAN WATER...,1121904000,"07 21,

You can excuse her Vietnamese relatives for not doing their homework--they are busy trying to scratch out a living in very difficult conditions and have had little education.  Anyway, that was the only thing you can blame Heidi for.On the other hand, the filmmakers knew exactly what was in store.  They had a handle on both cultures and knew what (and probably when) to expect regarding the inevitable collision.Vicente Franco and Gail Dolgin should be ashamed of themselves, but I am sure they aren't...their culture rewards this kind of heartless exploitation.

801480,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0001DMW2A,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 3]","Daughter from Danang is a powerful and riveting documentary regardless of your feelings about Heidi Bub (born in Vietnam as Hiep to an unmarried woman named Mai Thi Kim) or Heidi's natural birth mother and her half-siblings in Vietnam. The documentary goes along at a very good pace and the editing was done well so that I didn't ever feel bored although I certainly have my opinions about Heidi, Mai Thi Kim and Heidi's Vietnamese relatives. The cinematography was very well done and I can see what this won a prestigious award at The Sundance Film Festival just a few years back.The story of Heidi Bub is one that we don't think of terribly often; and that makes the film all the more interesting. Heidi was born to a poor, unmarried woman in Danang, Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Her mother had a relationship with an American serviceman essentially to keep food on the table and clothes on their backs. However, when Heidi was just seven years old, her mother made the painful decision to send Hiep to American during Operation Babylift at the end of the Vietnam War; Mai Thi Kim did this so that Hiep would have a chance to survive the war with a good life in America, a chance that Kim and her older children could never have had.Hiep is adopted by a cold, abusive woman who treats Heidi as a full fledged American without any regard for her ethnic background; and this comes back to haunt Heidi when she finally does travel to Vietnam to meet her birth mother and her half-siblings. Needless to say, Heidi is quite Americanized; she's been raised in a part of Tennessee where the KKK originated and she's led a sheltered, relatively privileged life despite her estrangement from her foster mother. Meanwhile, Heidi's relatives back in Vietnam have continued their very different way of life and there's quite a culture clash along with some very heavy emotional scenes once Heidi meets her relatives in Vietnam.One could say that Heidi was set up by the filmmakers; that she didn't do her homework about the Vietnamese way of life; that her Vietnamese relatives were too pushy about repeatedly asking for money--and more. I think there's some truth to all of these assertions but I leave it up to you to make your own conclusions.Daughter from Danang is not a film you forget anytime soon. It's powerful and very professionally done. It will stimulate a lot of meaningful conversation as well after you watch it with others. I highly recommend this film for people studying Vietnamese culture as well as culture clashes and sociology in general.

801481,A912C7977MO6O,B0001DMW2A,Smallchief,"[4, 4]","""Daughter from Danang"" is an unsentimental look at a attempt of an adopted child to reconnect with her birth family.  Heidi, daughter of a Vietnamese woman and an American soldier, at age seven was given up by her mother for adoption in the US.  Twenty-two years later she comes back to Vietnam to find her birth mother and family.Heidi's American mother seems to have been a cold person and Heidi is looking for the selfless maternal love she never had. Her Vietnamese relatives have different expectations of her.  Heidi is naive and unfamiliar with Vietnamese culture; she  doesn't even know what the ubiquitious ""nuc mam"" (fish sauce) is. Her relatives, lower-middle class urban Vietnamese, are grasping. They are similarly naive and think they can impose family responsibilities on their ""rich"" American relative. The meeting between Heidi and her Vietnamese relatives does not go well.Left unexplored in this film is the status of Amerasian children in Vietnam.  Those who were left behind in Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in 1975 were treated abominably by the communists, their society, and often their families.  The fact that her mother gave Heidi up for adoption may have been based on fear of the communists or may have been that she was an embarrasment to the family -- most likely a combination of the two.  Therefore, does Heidi have an obligation to her Vietnamese relatives or a grievance against them? An interesting and unanswered question.The remarkable thing about this film is that we did not get the usual pap about happy reunions between long separated family members.  Rather we see that the thoroughly Americanized Heidi feels little empathy with her Vietnamese family and theirs toward her seems motivated by financial expectations. It's not a unique situation for immigrants to America to face.Smallchief",5,You can't go home again,1164672000,"11 28, 2006",2006,1835,"['Daughter', 'Danang', 'unsentimental', 'look', 'attempt', 'adopted', 'child', 'reconnect', 'birth', 'family', 'Heidi', 'daughter', 'Vietnamese', 'woman', 'American', 'soldier', 'age', 'seven', 'was', 'given', 'up', 'mother', 'adoption', 'US', 'Twenty-two', 'years', 'later', 'back', 'Vietnam', 'find', 'birth', 'mother', 'family.Heidi', 'American', 'mother', 'have', 'been', 'cold', 'person', 'Heidi', 'looking', 'selfless', 'maternal', 'love', 'never', 'had', 'Vietnamese', 'relatives', 'have', 'different', 'expectations', 'Heidi', 'naive', 'unfamiliar', 'Vietnamese', 'culture', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'ubiquitious', 'nuc', 'mam', 'fish', 'sauce', 'relatives', 'lower-middle', 'class', 'urban', 'Vietnamese', 'are', 'grasping', 'are', 'similarly', 'naive', 'think', 'can', 'impose', 'family', 'responsibilities', 'rich', 'American', 'relative', 'meeting', 'Heidi', 'Vietnamese', 'relatives', 'not', 'go', 'well.Left', 'unexplored', 'film', 'status', 'Amerasian', 'children', 'Vietnam', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'behind', 'Vietnam', 'fall', 'Saigon', '1975', 'were', 'treated', 'abominably', 'communists', 'society', 'often', 'families', 'fact', 'mother', 'gave', 'Heidi', 'up', 'adoption', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'fear', 'communists', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'embarrasment', 'family', 'most', 'likely', 'combination', 'two', 'Therefore', 'Heidi', 'have', 'obligation', 'Vietnamese', 'relatives', 'grievance', 'interesting', 'unanswered', 'question.The', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'usual', 'pap', 'happy', 'reunions', 'long', 'separated', 'family', 'members', 'see', 'thoroughly', 'Americanized', 'Heidi', 'little', 'empathy', 'Vietnamese', 'family', 'motivated', 'financial', 'expectations', 'not', 'unique', 'situation', 'immigrants', 'America', 'face.Smallchief']",N/A
801482,A1Z26JLRD3B48Y,B0001DMW2A,"SMC ""SMC""","[13, 16]","Heidi Bub, a 29yr old wife and mother living in Tennessee, launches on an overseas journey to find her roots in Vietnam.At age 6, young Hiep is surrendered by her mother to Americans, who, through Operation Babylift, take the Vietnamese children of American military men back to the U.S. to be adopted by American families.Hiep's mother made a noble and heartbreaking sacrifice, surrendering her child because of rumors that all Amerasian children remaining in Vietnam would be burned alive after the war.Hiep was flown to the U.S., adopted by a single woman who moved them to Tennessee, and - at age six - transformed from Hiep into Heidi.At age six, she remembered her previous home, her biological mother and siblings, the trauma of the war. She carried with her no understanding of the sacrifice made by her family -- only the sense of loss and abandonment, and the childlike belief that she must be a bad person to have been left by her mother.When she ultimately split from her adoptive mother, Heidi began to long for her first home, to finally find ""a mother's love"" -- someone who would love and accept her ""just as I am.""When she found her biological mother, she discovered the pretty dreams of reunion and unconditional love could not match reality. Her family was grindingly poor -- something she was clearly not prepared for. They lived with the hopes that she -- an American and someone better off than they -- would rise to her familial obligations and care for the family by providing for them. Cherished Asian values of community and filial duty clash with American values of individualism and privacy. Heidi is insulted by all the talk of money. Conversations center around the family's wish for her monetary help. She cannot meet their expectations, she tells them. She guards her money and her heart and her privacy, wiping off her cheek where her doting mother plants frequent kisses. Resenting the ""touchy-touchy"" of her family, who don't value the distance and aloofness she does as an American. The cultural gap between Heidi and the family that once was hers is wide and unbridgeable.The cultural misunderstandings between them lead to an irreparable split. Heidi's mother loses Hiep again, and her suffering and grief is unbearable to witness.In their desperation to please Heidi, to explain themselves and their cultural norms, they attempt to communicate through a translator. Despite their poverty, they give Heidi gifts for her family. But Heidi can't see past her sense of insult, her regret at having made the trip to Vietnam, only to ruin her previously golden memories and dreams ""with all this bad stuff.""She is a difficult person to sympathize with. It would have taken so little for her to make a difference in their lives. A monthly stipend of a few dollars would have made the difference of where that family lived, whether her nieces and nephews could go to school. However, she clings to her dreams of the perfect adoption reunion which results in a happily-ever-after family, a ""sweet, gentle, soft-spoken Asian mom"" who loves her without asking anything in return. She can't wait to leave Vietnam -- the culture-shock overwhelms her. She arrives back in Tennessee, tells her adoptive grandmother ""you're who I know."" Her grandmother tells her ""I'm glad you went. I'm glad you got good pictures."" Meanwhile, we see Heidi's mother in Vietnam weeping, suffering because she's lost Hiep all over again.For me, it doesn't challenge the notion of adoption -- no, rather it challenges this American preoccupation with the dream of adoption reunions. When American adoptees seek to reunite with biological families overseas, this film is a stark reminder that those families will have cultural norms that oftentimes clash strongly with Americans' values. This film reminds us that biological families will have needs and expectations. When adoptees travel, not knowing, not understanding those needs, this film reminds us that the cultural gaps can lead to devastating results -- especially for the biological families. It left me wishing that Heidi had thought this through first. A little empathy and generosity would have gone a long, long way.",4,adoption reunions don't always work out,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,4182,"['Heidi', 'Bub', '29yr', 'old', 'wife', 'mother', 'living', 'Tennessee', 'overseas', 'journey', 'find', 'roots', 'Vietnam.At', 'age', '6', 'young', 'Hiep', 'surrendered', 'mother', 'Americans', 'who', 'Operation', 'Babylift', 'take', 'Vietnamese', 'children', 'American', 'military', 'men', 'back', 'U.S.', 'be', 'adopted', 'American', 'families.Hiep', 'mother', 'made', 'noble', 'heartbreaking', 'sacrifice', 'surrendering', 'child', 'rumors', 'Amerasian', 'children', 'remaining', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'be', 'burned', 'alive', 'war.Hiep', 'was', 'flown', 'U.S.', 'adopted', 'single', 'woman', 'who', 'moved', 'Tennessee', 'age', 'six', 'transformed', 'Hiep', 'Heidi.At', 'age', 'six', 'remembered', 'previous', 'home', 'biological', 'mother', 'siblings', 'trauma', 'war', 'carried', 'understanding', 'sacrifice', 'made', 'family', 'only', 'sense', 'loss', 'abandonment', 'childlike', 'belief', 'must', 'be', 'bad', 'person', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'mother.When', 'ultimately', 'split', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'Heidi', 'began', 'long', 'first', 'home', 'finally', 'find', 'mother', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'love', 'accept', 'just', 'am', 'When', 'found', 'biological', 'mother', 'discovered', 'pretty', 'dreams', 'reunion', 'unconditional', 'love', 'could', 'not', 'match', 'reality', 'family', 'was', 'grindingly', 'poor', 'something', 'was', 'clearly', 'not', 'prepared', 'lived', 'hopes', 'American', 'someone', 'better', 'off', 'would', 'rise', 'familial', 'obligations', 'care', 'family', 'providing', 'Cherished', 'Asian', 'values', 'community', 'filial', 'duty', 'clash', 'American', 'values', 'individualism', 'privacy', 'Heidi', 'insulted', 'talk', 'money', 'Conversations', 'center', 'family', 'wish', 'monetary', 'help', 'can', 'not', 'meet', 'expectations', 'guards', 'money', 'heart', 'privacy', 'wiping', 'off', 'cheek', 'where', 'doting', 'mother', 'plants', 'frequent', 'kisses', 'Resenting', 'touchy-touchy', 'family', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'value', 'distance', 'aloofness', 'American', 'cultural', 'gap', 'Heidi', 'family', 'once', 'was', 'hers', 'wide', 'unbridgeable.The', 'cultural', 'misunderstandings', 'lead', 'irreparable', 'split', 'Heidi', 'mother', 'Hiep', 'again', 'suffering', 'grief', 'unbearable', 'witness.In', 'desperation', 'please', 'Heidi', 'explain', 'cultural', 'norms', 'attempt', 'communicate', 'translator', 'poverty', 'give', 'Heidi', 'gifts', 'family', 'Heidi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'sense', 'insult', 'regret', 'having', 'made', 'trip', 'Vietnam', 'only', 'ruin', 'previously', 'golden', 'memories', 'dreams', 'bad', 'stuff', 'difficult', 'person', 'sympathize', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'so', 'little', 'make', 'difference', 'lives', 'monthly', 'stipend', 'few', 'dollars', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'where', 'family', 'lived', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'could', 'go', 'school', 'However', 'dreams', 'perfect', 'adoption', 'reunion', 'results', 'happily-ever-after', 'family', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'soft-spoken', 'Asian', 'mom', 'who', 'asking', 'anything', 'return', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'leave', 'Vietnam', 'culture-shock', 'overwhelms', 'back', 'Tennessee', 'adoptive', 'grandmother', ""'re"", 'who', 'know', 'grandmother', ""'m"", 'glad', 'went', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'good', 'pictures', 'Meanwhile', 'see', 'Heidi', 'mother', 'Vietnam', 'weeping', 'suffering', 'lost', 'Hiep', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'notion', 'adoption', 'rather', 'American', 'preoccupation', 'dream', 'adoption', 'reunions', 'When', 'American', 'adoptees', 'seek', 'reunite', 'biological', 'families', 'overseas', 'film', 'stark', 'reminder', 'families', 'will', 'have', 'cultural', 'norms', 'clash', 'strongly', 'Americans', 'values', 'film', 'biological', 'families', 'will', 'have', 'needs', 'expectations', 'When', 'adoptees', 'travel', 'not', 'knowing', 'not', 'understanding', 'needs', 'film', 'cultural', 'gaps', 'can', 'lead', 'devastating', 'results', 'especially', 'biological', 'families', 'left', 'wishing', 'Heidi', 'had', 'thought', 'first', 'little', 'empathy', 'generosity', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'long', 'way']",N/A
801483,AR2ZNBYLIUYQ6,B0001DMW2A,Timegoesby,"[0, 0]","This was a pretty good film about an adopted girl who reunites with her birth mother in Vietnam. I think it's hard to tell exactly what happened since the film is about 83 minutes, and some of what happened beneath the surface couldn't be conveyed in a film.It seems like the Vietnamese family was accepting and welcoming of her, but I can't tell how much of it is genuine warmth and how much of it is hope that she has the means to better their lives. I think it's most likely the mother gave her up for adoption since women who had been with servicemen were looked down on as ""whores"" and children of mixed race most likely carried stigmas and reminders of shame and embarrassment for the family.I can understand why the family asked Heidi for money, afterall, Vietnam is considerably poorer than the U.S. and USD can convert to a lot of VND. People in Vietnam also seem to assume Americans are rich. As of today's rate, $1 USD converts to 20889.99 VND, which goes far in Vietnam. You can see the family lives in relative poverty. Maybe they want the mother to go over to the U.S., get a visa, and then gradually send for the rest of the family.I'm not sure why Heidi reacted the way she did, she wasn't obligated to do anything she didn't want to, especially since she didn't know them well. I assume she has anger about being given up for adoption and then growing up half-Viet in the white South. The poverty and culture of Vietnam would be a huge shock.All in all, the earlier proclaimations of ""love"",""daughter"" and ""family"" seem very superficial coming from Heidi. The same proclaimations seem insincere from the mother, it's hard to warm up to someone you don't know that fast. I never thought instantaneous bonding after 22 years of separation was realistic anyways. Not sure what the Vietnamese family is genuinely thinking or feeling.Interesting movie. It made me think about issues concerning family, culture, race, reuniting, obligations etc.(From a personal point of view, I don't think either side was that sincere. I don't think Heidi was obliged to provide for the mother though - they didn't bring her up, in fact, they gave her away. You don't just become ""family"" overnight and expect money - that goes for Vietnamese or American culture.)",4,Interesting,1349308800,"10 4, 2012",2012,2260,"['was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'adopted', 'girl', 'who', 'birth', 'mother', 'Vietnam', 'think', 'hard', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'film', '83', 'minutes', 'what', 'happened', 'surface', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'conveyed', 'film.It', 'Vietnamese', 'family', 'was', 'accepting', 'welcoming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'how', 'much', 'hope', 'means', 'better', 'lives', 'think', 'most', 'likely', 'mother', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'women', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'servicemen', 'were', 'looked', 'down', 'whores', 'children', 'mixed', 'race', 'most', 'likely', 'carried', 'stigmas', 'reminders', 'shame', 'embarrassment', 'family.I', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'family', 'asked', 'Heidi', 'money', 'afterall', 'Vietnam', 'considerably', 'poorer', 'U.S.', 'USD', 'can', 'convert', 'lot', 'VND', 'People', 'Vietnam', 'also', 'seem', 'assume', 'Americans', 'are', 'rich', 'today', 'rate', '1', 'USD', 'converts', '20889.99', 'VND', 'far', 'Vietnam', 'can', 'see', 'family', 'relative', 'poverty', 'Maybe', 'want', 'mother', 'go', 'U.S.', 'get', 'visa', 'then', 'gradually', 'send', 'rest', 'family.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Heidi', 'reacted', 'way', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'obligated', 'do', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'especially', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'well', 'assume', 'anger', 'being', 'given', 'up', 'adoption', 'then', 'growing', 'up', 'half-Viet', 'white', 'South', 'poverty', 'culture', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'shock.All', 'earlier', 'proclaimations', 'love', 'daughter', 'family', 'seem', 'very', 'superficial', 'coming', 'Heidi', 'same', 'proclaimations', 'seem', 'insincere', 'mother', 'hard', 'warm', 'up', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fast', 'never', 'thought', 'instantaneous', 'bonding', '22', 'years', 'separation', 'was', 'realistic', 'anyways', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'Vietnamese', 'family', 'genuinely', 'thinking', 'feeling.Interesting', 'movie', 'made', 'think', 'issues', 'concerning', 'family', 'culture', 'race', 'reuniting', 'obligations', 'etc', 'personal', 'point', 'view', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'side', 'was', 'sincere', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Heidi', 'was', 'obliged', 'provide', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'up', 'fact', 'gave', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'become', 'family', 'overnight', 'expect', 'money', 'Vietnamese', 'American', 'culture']",N/A
801484,A2U1365B242BPO,B0001DMW2A,William Plowden,"[7, 14]","My wife watched this documentary as a double feature along with Spellbound (another documentary).  While I loved Spellbound, I was disappointed with Daughter From Danang.  Actually, that is not totally true.  The reason I give this four stars is that I was disappointed with THE daughter from Danang, not the film itself.  The film does exactly what it set out to do: show a clash of cultures in a very emotional event.  Not only is there the reunion of a mother and daughter, but it's done in Vietnam with all the politcal and social baggage that entails.Maybe the folks filming this, or pushing for her to realize her dream of finally meeting her birth mother should have prepared Heidi for what she was going to find in Vietnam.  Heidi is very ""Americanized"", even more so than some Americans.  Unfortunatly, Americanized here seems to mean discomfort with extreme poverty and thinking that this was some kind of vacation that she could go home and not have to think about later.  She expresses discomfort with the amount of physical attention she receives from her mother (who hasn't seen her since she put Heidi on the plane, go figure).  But the real climax is when her half-brother brings up helping out the family with some financial assitance.  On one hand, I can see Heidi not wanting to go to some of the extremes her Vietnamese family wanted her to, but on the other hand her reaction was just too dramatic for me.  I found myself talking to the TV set, imploring Heidi to ""Grow up!"".Kudos to those who filmed this.  You accurately captured this true clash of cultures and emotion.  That you picked an ungrateful child to film is not fault of yours.",4,"Great Documentary, Poor Humanity",1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,1661,"['wife', 'watched', 'documentary', 'double', 'feature', 'Spellbound', 'documentary', 'loved', 'Spellbound', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Daughter', 'From', 'Danang', 'Actually', 'not', 'totally', 'true', 'reason', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'was', 'disappointed', 'THE', 'daughter', 'Danang', 'not', 'film', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'show', 'clash', 'cultures', 'very', 'emotional', 'event', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'reunion', 'mother', 'daughter', 'done', 'Vietnam', 'politcal', 'social', 'baggage', 'folks', 'filming', 'pushing', 'realize', 'dream', 'finally', 'meeting', 'birth', 'mother', 'should', 'have', 'prepared', 'Heidi', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'find', 'Vietnam', 'Heidi', 'very', 'Americanized', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Americans', 'Unfortunatly', 'Americanized', 'here', 'mean', 'discomfort', 'extreme', 'poverty', 'thinking', 'was', 'kind', 'vacation', 'could', 'go', 'home', 'not', 'have', 'think', 'later', 'discomfort', 'amount', 'physical', 'attention', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'put', 'Heidi', 'plane', 'go', 'figure', 'real', 'climax', 'when', 'half-brother', 'up', 'helping', 'family', 'financial', 'assitance', 'one', 'hand', 'can', 'see', 'Heidi', 'not', 'wanting', 'go', 'extremes', 'Vietnamese', 'family', 'wanted', 'other', 'hand', 'reaction', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'dramatic', 'found', 'talking', 'TV', 'set', 'imploring', 'Heidi', 'Grow', 'up', '.Kudos', 'who', 'filmed', 'accurately', 'captured', 'true', 'clash', 'cultures', 'emotion', 'picked', 'ungrateful', 'child', 'film', 'not', 'fault', 'yours']",N/A
