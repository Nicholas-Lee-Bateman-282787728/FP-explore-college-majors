Now let me go into some more detail. The story is excellent on many levels, and it's a bit more complex than a retelling of the plot would indicate. ""Black man accused of raping white girl in the Depression era."" That's the court case that drives some of Harper Lee's novel. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of attorney Atticus Finch, one of literature's most memorable characters. And yet, in the novel, Atticus isn't the main character. This book is about his daughter Scout and his son Jem. Scout is our narrator, and what we see (and don't see) comes from her.So how did this translate to the big screen? Quite well. The child actors, both newcomers, were excellent in their roles. Ditto on the boy who portrayed Dill, whose part was far larger in the novel but which is good in the film as well. The book had a large number of plots and subplots, so the filmmakers had to strip some away to make it work as a movie. They chose well. The results are still as complex and multi-textured as life itself.I watched this maybe a month after reading it, so I remembered 90% of what would happen, along with much of what was deleted. I doubt the movie could have been done much better than it was, and I'll watch it again. I'm aware of all the ""deep dark Southern secrets"" from the novel, those that were in the film and those that weren't. I got a strong sense that the actors were equally aware, and that's cool. Nobody could fit them all into a film that lasts under 2 hours, so they only chose the most relevant. This is how it should be. I very love this film, as we say in China, and it'll probably be in my DVD collection until I die.Oh, and this is purely coincidental. Later in this newsletter you'll see ""The One-Plot Wonder,"" which I wrote over a year ago but chose to rerun. I made this decision long before watching TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.

Set in depression era Alabama, it's seen through the eyes of 8 year old Scout, beautifully played by Mary Badham, and the sensitivity of director Mulligan's vision is remarkable.Prejudice is the theme that runs through the story, from the harrowing court case of Tom (an amazing performance by Brock Peters), falsely accused of rape, to the demonization of Boo  (played by Robert Duvall, in his screen debut...he's intensely moving as this innocent and silent man).Russell Harlan's superb cinematography should be seen in the widescreen version to be fully appreciated, and Elmer Bernstein's Americana style score adds so much to the film.Gregory Peck's Oscar winning performance is magnificent.

50450,AGEIT17HENDIS,0783222955,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","This film is an excellent black and white adaptation of Harper Lee's book of the same name. The acting, particularly by Gregory Peck (and a cameo by a young Robert Duval), brings out all the pathos, bathos and grit of small town Southern life in the 1930's. The story itself is an unusual combination, narrated by Peck's film daughter (and presumably Lee herself), of a stage of the coming of age story that we are fairly familiar with and the question of race and sex in the Deep South (and not only there) with which we were (at the time of the film's debut in 1962) only vaguely familiar. That dramatic tension, muted as it was by the cinematic and social conventions of the time, nevertheless made a strong statement about the underlying tensions of this society at a time when the Southern black civil rights struggle movement was coming in focus in the national consciousness.The name Atticus Finch (Peck's role) as the liberal (for that southern locale) lawyer committed to the rule of law had a certain currency in the 1960's as a symbol for those southern whites who saw that Jim Crow had to go. Here Finch is the appointed lawyer for a black man accused of raping a white women of low origin- the classic `white trash' depicted in many a film and novel. Finch earnestly, no, passionately in his understated manner, attempts to defend this man, a brave act in itself under the circumstances.Needless to say an all white jury of that black man's `peers' nevertheless convicts him out of hand. In the end the black man tries to escape and is killed in the process. In an earlier scenario Finch is pressed into guard duty at the jailhouse in order to head off a posse of `white trash' elements who are bend on doing `justice' their way- hanging him from a lynching tree. On a mere false accusation of a white woman this black man is doomed whichever way he turns. Sound familiar?The other part of the story concerns the reactions by Finch's motherless son and tomboyish daughter to the realities of social life, Southern style. That part is in some ways, particularly when the children watch the trial from the ""Negro"" balcony section of the courtroom, the least successful of the film. What is entirely believable and gives some relief from the travesty that is unfolding are the pranks, pitfalls and antics of the kids. The tensions between brother and sister, the protective role of the older brother, the attempt by the sister to assert her own identity, the sense of adventure and mystery of what lies beyond the immediate household that is the hallmark of youth all get a work out here. But in the end it is the quiet dignity of solid old Atticus and the bewildered dignity of a doomed black man that hold this whole thing together. Bravo Peck.

Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) has to defend a black man  unjustly accused of raping a white girl, and along the way he has to fend  off a lynching party; such were those times.  Mostly the movie is told from  the point of view of Atticus' two children, Scout and Jem, and their  gradual moral awakening that life in their little town is not always a  matter of please-and-thank-you.This is a deliberate movie, almost  courtly in the way it unfolds, and I only hope that it holds the attention  spans of today's MTV generation.  To me, the languid pace seems perfectly  at home with small towns, summer heat, southern courtliness, and Gregory  Peck's quiet integrity as an actor and his tendency to slightly underplay a  scene.

His children, Jem and Scout, played by Philip Alford and Mary Badham are extremely well-cast and act very naturally.

50460,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783222955,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I've been intrigued by the idea of `To Kill a Mockingbird' for some time now.  Knowing that it is rendered one of the finest cinematic accomplishments of all time had perked my interest early on but it became the movie I wanted to see but never got around to.  It's hard to find this little treasure in any rental place, but recently our library received a copy and so I snatched it up the second it was available.  Now I must say that I have not read the novel yet.  It's on my VERY LONG LIST of `must reads' but I just have yet to reach it.  After watching this film though I may have to reach that book a little quicker than anticipated.I guess the first thing I should say is that everything you've heard about this film is true, all the praise it received was well deserved and every second of it's running time is well worth it.  I was absorbed in this film from start to finish.`To Kill a Mockingbird' broaches the subject of racism in the South during the depression but it's overlaying message of equality and acceptance are what we should all be taking away from this masterpiece.  The film revolves around a count case involving a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is the man selected to represent him.  The story is told through the eyes of Atticus' children, mostly his daughter Scout.  As Scout and her brother Jem battle their own quote-unquote prejudices with a neighborhood boy named Boo Radley they watch their father work to free a man he knows is innocent.  Atticus, a widower, works equally hard to instill good morals in his two children and raise them right and this is reflected in their ability to reason on situations, some even too big for them to fully understand.`To Kill a Mockingbird' has been labeled a classic, and you don't call them classics for nothing.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' truly is a downright perfect film.  The acting is superb, which is something I never truly expected.  I have watched a fair share of older films and have always found that the acting never truly stacks up to the great actors of today, but the performances by Gregory Peck especially rival those of today.  Gregory Peck (who won the Oscar for this performance) comes across so natural, so organic here.  He reacts as a father would, with subtleties when necessary as well as force.  His performance is understandably tempered and it helps aid the message of the film along.The two young children as well, Mary Badham and Philip Alford, are excellent here.  For young actors they grasped their characters exceptionally well.  Brock Peters is convincing as Tom Robinson, the black man on trial, and James Anderson is deliciously evil as Robert Ewell, the man accusing him of the crime (against his daughter).It was also interesting to see a young Robert Duvall here in a very small yet very powerful role.  He was truly commanding and played a key part in making this film's message a universal one.In the end I don't think there are enough good things to be said about `To Kill a Mockingbird'.  It's brilliantly scripted, acted and directed and stands the test of time, for while it was released in 1962 it still means something today, 45 years later.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' is a film that everyone should see in order to appreciate and one that I highly recommend to anyone with the slightest interest.

For those who also enjoy Robert Duvall's huge body of work, it may be interesting to note this film as his first, in a non-speaking but pivotal role as Boo Radley.It would be easy to dismiss an old film that deals with the race issue in Alabama. Some might think this topic has been done to death and, to an extent, they are right. But To Kill a Mockingbird is not solely about racism. It deals with honesty, justice, fear, childhood, quick judgements and parenthood. Even the race card is dealt with fairly, without blowing things out to sensational proportions. It shows that minor, selfish decisions, which rely on the racism in others, can breed larger evils.An adult Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch narrates much of the story but it is her father, Atticus, around which the narrative hinges. Played with subtle dignity by Peck, Atticus is a small town Lawyer who agrees to defend Tom Robinson against charges of Rape. He agrees, in the full knowledge that many of his neighbours will hate him for defending a black man and still others will expect him to put up only a token effort. Instead, Atticus does what we know he will... his best.There is an interesting contrast between what we see of Atticus and how his two children describe him. Apparently he's too old to do anything, like play ball, and they are a bit embarrassed by his quite ways. The trial and its associated moral battles put their father squarely in the spotlight and not in a good way. He and they are attacked and ridiculed but in the end Scout and Jem see a different picture of their old Pop. A man who is strong enough to stand against hatred, and brave enough to highlight the weaknesses of flawed white girl against the strengths of an honest black man.The name of the film is taken from one of Attcus's rules relating to using a rifle. Jem relates his father's instruction &quot;to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird...Well, I reckon because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncribs, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us.&quot;There are several Mockingbirds in this movie; the misunderstood Boo Radley, Tom Robins and even Atticus. For me though, the film is defined when Reverend Sykes asks Scout to stand up in the court gallery, after a failed defence, saying &quot;Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passin.&quot;",5,A small town lesson for the whole world,1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,3067,"['easy', 'think', 'quot', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'quot', 'older', 'Released', '1962', 'same', 'year', 'James', 'Bond', 'was', 'immortalised', 'quot', 'Dr.', 'No', 'quot', 'director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'chose', 'film', 'black', 'amp', 'white', 'Hollywood', 'rush', 'adopt', 'new', 'Kodachrome', 'II', 'color', 'film', 'story', 'set', '1930', 'classic', 'look', 'film', 'weight', 'historic', 'reality.Adapted', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'only', 'book', 'won', 'Pulitzer', 'prize', 'script', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'Added', 'stellar', 'cast', 'who', 'manage', 'hold', 'own', 'amazing', 'performance', 'given', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'actor', 'peak', 'abilities', 'who', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'huge', 'body', 'work', 'may', 'be', 'interesting', 'note', 'film', 'first', 'non-speaking', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Boo', 'Radley.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'old', 'film', 'deals', 'race', 'issue', 'Alabama', 'might', 'think', 'topic', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'extent', 'are', 'right', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'not', 'solely', 'racism', 'honesty', 'justice', 'fear', 'childhood', 'quick', 'judgements', 'parenthood', 'Even', 'race', 'card', 'dealt', 'fairly', 'blowing', 'things', 'out', 'sensational', 'proportions', 'minor', 'selfish', 'decisions', 'rely', 'racism', 'others', 'can', 'breed', 'larger', 'evils.An', 'adult', 'Jean', 'Louise', 'Finch', 'narrates', 'much', 'story', 'father', 'Atticus', 'narrative', 'hinges', 'Played', 'subtle', 'dignity', 'Peck', 'Atticus', 'small', 'town', 'Lawyer', 'who', 'defend', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'charges', 'Rape', 'full', 'knowledge', 'many', 'neighbours', 'will', 'hate', 'defending', 'black', 'man', 'still', 'others', 'will', 'expect', 'put', 'up', 'only', 'token', 'effort', 'Instead', 'Atticus', 'what', 'know', 'will', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'what', 'see', 'Atticus', 'how', 'two', 'children', 'describe', 'Apparently', 'too', 'old', 'do', 'anything', 'play', 'ball', 'are', 'bit', 'embarrassed', 'quite', 'ways', 'trial', 'associated', 'moral', 'battles', 'put', 'father', 'squarely', 'spotlight', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'are', 'attacked', 'ridiculed', 'end', 'Scout', 'Jem', 'see', 'different', 'picture', 'old', 'Pop', 'A', 'man', 'who', 'strong', 'enough', 'stand', 'hatred', 'brave', 'enough', 'highlight', 'weaknesses', 'flawed', 'white', 'girl', 'strengths', 'honest', 'black', 'man.The', 'name', 'film', 'taken', 'one', 'Attcus', 'rules', 'relating', 'using', 'rifle', 'Jem', 'father', 'instruction', 'quot', 'remember', 'was', 'sin', 'kill', 'mockingbird', 'Well', 'reckon', 'mockingbirds', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'make', 'music', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'people', 'gardens', 'do', ""n't"", 'nest', 'corncribs', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'just', 'sing', 'hearts', 'out', 'us.', 'quot', 'are', 'several', 'Mockingbirds', 'movie', 'misunderstood', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'Tom', 'Robins', 'even', 'Atticus', 'film', 'defined', 'when', 'Reverend', 'Sykes', 'Scout', 'stand', 'up', 'court', 'gallery', 'failed', 'defence', 'saying', 'quot', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Louise', 'stand', 'up', 'father', 'passin.', 'quot']",N/A

50467,ARA48345JZPZR,0783222955,Archmaker,"[5, 6]","Harper Lee must have loved her Daddy and big brother.  Her warm fictional remembrance of them as Atticus and Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird is filled with respect and love.  She had a story to tell of race and hatred and tolerance and understanding, but underpinning all of it is her love of the two central males of her childhood, her kind and wise father, and her loving, protective brother.  This is the heart of her book, and it is the heart of this faithfully adapted film of that book.In an age that usually draws males and females in broad caricatures, depicting brutishness and carnality as the norm, and crassness and &quot;in-your-face&quot; as the only form of honesty, the characters in Mockingbird are not only refreshing, they are a revelation.The book and the film is largely about decency.  Simple human decency.  The characters in this story of childhood adventures, awakenings and surprises, with the trial of an innocent black man in the South of the 30's at its center, are by and large decent people.From Scout's father, Atticus, sincerely defending the man, to the Judge wanting a fair trial and result, to the defendant Tom and his family, to Cal the housekeeper, to the lady next door, to the Reverend, to the simple and plain but honest Sheriff, and even the farmer momentarily caught up in the lynch mob mentality....all are essentially decent people struggling within their society's preconceived assumptions and intolerances to do what's right. And, of course, there is Boo.Yes, the world has its share of ignorant, cowardly, and hate-filled Bob Ewells.  But, they do not define the world, so long as there are good men and women striving to do the right thing.This flawlessly cast movie is a masterpiece.  It captures the innocense and wonder of childhood, and the sometimes tragedy &amp; struggle of adulthood without preaching. The performances are first rate down to the smallest role.  Robert Mulligan manages to capture the world from a child's perspective without belaboring it.The world has spun around a few times since I saw this movie on it's release when I was little more than a child myself.  It captured and moved me then.  It moves me now.

As soon as you say the title peoples eyes light up and they always say ""I LOVE THAT MOVIE!!"".  It's rare that a movie has such universal appeal that even my nephew who was seven at the time he saw it loved it and wanted to see it again.  I remember watching this when I was young.  It was so dark and there was such an air of seriousness (I was too young to realize everything happening in it) and the kids were literally so much like kids in my neighborhood accents and all.  The mystery of Boo Radley scared me silly but I couldn't help but watch it.  All I knew was that Gregory Peck was a dad that was too cool for words, who reluctantly shot a rabid dog in the street and who had a voice that would go right through you.  It left such an impression on me.  Especially Scout in the ham suit!Later when I actually knew what was happening in the movie.  I fell even deeper in love with this film. The relationship Scout and Jem had with their father was wondrous and moving.  There was such an air of admiration for Atticus from just about everyone.  Gregory Peck's performance as the widowed lawyer with 2 kids showed the strength, grace, dignity and vulnerability of Atticus Finch during the trial and aftermath of Tom Robinson the black man accused of rape.  Mary Badham's performance as the mischievous and willful tomboy named Scout who lovingly reminisces about her mother with her father is so pure and innocent.  She and her brother Jem's decision to make the town recluse come out of hiding is a fateful one that will forever change their lives.

This movie is the &#8220;Benchmark&#8221; for the definition of &#8220;Five Stars&#8221; in my book.  As some pundit once said, it is the &#8220;which&#8221; than which there is nothing &#8220;whicher.&#8221;  I need fingers and also toes of more than just me to count the number of times I have seen this movie since the first time I watched it when I was in fourth grade in the late 1960s, and my whole family sat riveted, huddled under wool blankets, on our unheated, glassed-in porch that doubled as a TV room in those days.  Even as a fourth-grader, I knew this movie would change my life after I saw it.  Many decades later, I can tell you that it still changes me every time I watch it. The movie bestows wisdom on so many issues, and you will find yourself noticing events in your own life that mirror those unforgettable teachings.  The character development in this film was unprecedented at the time it was made. And the plot was unprecedented for its time too.  In an era when little girls were being sold &#8220;Easy Bake Ovens&#8221; and there was no such thing as an &#8220;alternative family,&#8221; this movie&#8217;s protagonist is a tomboy (Scout) in a family headed by a man (Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer), and the children&#8217;s best friend is a delicate visiting neighbor modeled on Truman Capote.  I regret that almost all of the publicity about this movie has focused on the race relations aspect, only because it misses so much of what makes this movie great.  Admittedly, like everything about this movie, that aspect is groundbreaking, but it would be shortsighted to assume this is a movie &#8220;about race relations.&#8221;  The preponderance of the plot goes far beyond. &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221; is equally a movie about how to learn from misguided assumptions, about recognizing love, and about creative survival. I will stake my life and reputation that this is one of the best films ever made and that will ever be made.  Most films made now have &#8220;one note&#8221; themes.  &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221; covers far more ground.  In this movie, Scout&#8217;s learning about the impact of the Great Depression on human dignity is profound: her tempestuous interactions with an impoverished schoolmate whose father pays for his legal obligations to Atticus with bags full of nuts are tangible, and you can almost taste the syrup that her classmate pours over his eggs when he joins them for breakfast one day.  The scene where the children learn that their seemingly dull father is actually an accomplished sharp-shooter&#8212;when he kills with one shot a rabid dog threatening the town&#8212;is unforgettable. Most people who learn about this movie learn about the race relations story of the trial, and&#8212;as important as that is&#8212;it missed two thirds of the point of the movie&#8212;so I will end this review with a comment about the &#8220;Boo Radley&#8221; story overlaying the movie.  So as not to spoil the end of the movie for anyone who has not already seen it, let me just say that when the door swings back and it is revealed who &#8220;saved&#8221; Scout from being attacked, one realizes who the &#8220;the mockingbird&#8221; really is. No one will watch this movie and not feel changed by it.  Years after you watch it, you might hear the movie theme music and feel moved to tears.

I was just a teenager still in high school, but immediately loved the movie, which I  have seen countless times since. Gregory Peck is probably the single  greatest reason for the movie's smashing success, although the entire cast  does a terrific job in bringing this momentous story to the screen.  In  today's complex world one tends to lose perspective as to how explosive,  provocative, and sensational the issues of cross-race rape was in the early  1960s when the movie hit the screens. Yet despite the sizzling if subdued  sexual content and the divisive issues surrounding the movie, it quickly  became the movie of the year, winning Peck the Oscar for his incredible  portrayal of rural southern lawyer Atticus Finch.No doubt it is the  character of Atticus Finch who deserves most of the credit for the novel's  enduring popularity. Seldom has such a quietly heroic figure been so  favorably and memorably described in such loving detail in an American  novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the highly principled and somewhat  befuddled widower-lawyer trying his level best to raise his two young  children alone in the midst of the deep South during the early years of the  Depression. As daughter Scout remembers, there was little that Atticus  couldn't charm or talk his way out of. And, as played by Gregory Peck,  this thoughtful, moral, and courageous man became a model of modern  American manhood for all who read or watched his story unfold. Of course,  the other characters are also lovingly and carefully drawn and described,  and the way in which the importance and relevance of the mockingbird  parable is sown into the web of the story at a number of different levels  with a number of different characters is also one of the enduring treasures  found within the pages of this book.Whether considering Tom Robinson,  Boo Radley, Scout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we all come to better  understand the ways in which all the individuals' stories and fate are  intricately and inextricably interwoven with each other and into the fabric  of a particular time and place. Indeed, we watch with growing affection as  Atticus increasingly relies and depends on their black governess, and are  amazed by the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well. On  the other hand, we watch as Bob Ewell acts despicably to mistreat people of  color. There are volumes of wisdom herein regarding the treatment of human  beings and the problems associated with trying to live in any particular  place at any specific time. So well and accurately drawn are the characters  of this fable of the life and times of Scout Finch in &quot;To Kill A  Mockingbird&quot;, that one can only hope it continues to be widely seen  and appreciated as a modern American classic.",5,One Of The Best Dramas Ever Filmed!,964742400,"07 28, 2000",2000,2908,"['first', 'saw', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'rushing', 'out', 'buy', 'novel', 'read', 'movie', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'later', 'summer', 'was', 'just', 'teenager', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'immediately', 'loved', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'probably', 'single', 'greatest', 'reason', 'movie', 'smashing', 'success', 'entire', 'cast', 'terrific', 'job', 'bringing', 'momentous', 'story', 'screen', 'today', 'complex', 'world', 'one', 'lose', 'perspective', 'how', 'explosive', 'provocative', 'sensational', 'issues', 'cross-race', 'rape', 'was', 'early', '1960s', 'when', 'movie', 'hit', 'screens', 'sizzling', 'subdued', 'sexual', 'content', 'divisive', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'quickly', 'became', 'movie', 'year', 'winning', 'Peck', 'Oscar', 'incredible', 'portrayal', 'rural', 'southern', 'lawyer', 'Atticus', 'Finch.No', 'doubt', 'character', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'who', 'most', 'credit', 'novel', 'enduring', 'popularity', 'Seldom', 'quietly', 'heroic', 'figure', 'been', 'so', 'favorably', 'memorably', 'described', 'such', 'loving', 'detail', 'American', 'novel', 'fortyish', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'highly', 'principled', 'somewhat', 'befuddled', 'widower-lawyer', 'trying', 'level', 'best', 'raise', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'alone', 'midst', 'deep', 'South', 'early', 'years', 'Depression', 'daughter', 'Scout', 'remembers', 'was', 'little', 'Atticus', 'could', ""n't"", 'charm', 'talk', 'way', 'played', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'thoughtful', 'moral', 'courageous', 'man', 'became', 'model', 'modern', 'American', 'manhood', 'who', 'read', 'watched', 'story', 'unfold', 'course', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'lovingly', 'carefully', 'drawn', 'described', 'way', 'importance', 'relevance', 'mockingbird', 'parable', 'sown', 'web', 'story', 'number', 'different', 'levels', 'number', 'different', 'characters', 'also', 'one', 'enduring', 'found', 'pages', 'book.Whether', 'considering', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'Scout', 'Jem', 'Atticus', 'come', 'better', 'understand', 'ways', 'individuals', 'stories', 'fate', 'are', 'intricately', 'inextricably', 'interwoven', 'other', 'fabric', 'particular', 'time', 'place', 'Indeed', 'watch', 'growing', 'affection', 'Atticus', 'increasingly', 'black', 'governess', 'are', 'amazed', 'degree', 'concerned', 'welfare', 'well', 'other', 'hand', 'watch', 'Bob', 'Ewell', 'despicably', 'mistreat', 'people', 'color', 'are', 'volumes', 'wisdom', 'herein', 'regarding', 'treatment', 'human', 'beings', 'problems', 'associated', 'trying', 'live', 'particular', 'place', 'specific', 'time', 'So', 'well', 'accurately', 'drawn', 'are', 'characters', 'fable', 'life', 'times', 'Scout', 'Finch', 'quot', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'quot', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'be', 'widely', 'seen', 'appreciated', 'modern', 'American', 'classic']",N/A

50494,ACC1SLND21RI6,0783222955,Breyel,"[5, 6]","WOW! What more can be said aboutTo Kill A Mockingbirdthat has not been said before. It is such an awesome film, thanks to author Harper Lee's remarkably ingenious novel. It is no small wonder she won the Pulitzer Prize for it and Gregory Peck held her in such high esteem. It was undoubtedly the piece de resistance in his long and chequered career.The plot in the film is true to Harper Lee's novel. An adult Scout (played by Mary Badham) narrates and reflects on the events which took place over two summers when she was young girl, growing up in the Deep South, during the Depression-era 1930's. Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is her father, an attorney who has been appointed to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. Atticus confronts the racist father Bob Ewell (James Anderson) who has -- though we are not made immediately aware it -- beaten his daughter for befriending Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), the black man falsely charged of beating and raping her. In a parallel development, Scout, brother Jem (Phillip Alford) and friend Dell (John Megna) must learn to deal with their own fear and prejudice towards Boo Radley (Robert Duvall), the shy, gentle and mentally-challenged man who lives a few doors down from them in a derelict house. As the trial unfolds, Atticus reasons Tom Robinson is guilty only of pity and friendship towards a white woman, Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox). The Ewell's, who collectively represent a bigoted society that cannot tolerate racial integration, have merely claimed trial to cover their own social guilt or shame for associating with a black man, thus the jury falsely condemns Tom Robinson. Shortly thereafter, he dies under suspicious circumstances while being  transferred to a 'safe haven' in a neighbouring town. To avenge his humiliation in court, Bob Ewell attacks the Finch children. An unlikely guardian, Boo Radley, comes to their aid, killing Bob Ewell.So, where's the dead mockingbird? Well, Harper Lee's more subtle than that. To kill a mockingbird is actually a metaphor. The children, Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are mockingbirds. They live their lives as innocently as the mockingbird. They mean no harm to anyone or anything, just as the mockingbird merely warbles his birdsong, never disturbing corncribs and such things.  Ultimately though, each character  is either physically or symbolically killed: Tom Robinson is an innocent man falsely convicted and killed; the innocence of the children is lost to the ugliness of racial strife, which nearly leads to their death at the hands of Bob Ewell; and Boo Radley who kills Bob Ewell should be tried for murder, but will not be arrested and charged because of his innocent nature and selfless act of defending the children. After all, to use the words spoken by Atticus earlier in the film, it would be ""a sin to kill a mockingbird"".Director Robert Mulligan  does a splendid job of impressing this innocence upon the viewer. At the beginning of the film, he zooms into Jem's cigar box of memorabilia which he collects over the course of the story, then pans the camera while Scout thumbs through the crayons, marbles, broken pocket watch and figurines. As she hums away like a hummingbird, Mulligan immediately creates a mood of innocence through the eyes of a child.  He carries on with the day-to-day simplicity of childhood in a sleepy Southern town, until half way through the film; then we begin to see this innocence slowly whittled away, much in the way Harper Lee does in her book.Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch gives a reserved and dignified performance of his character, certainly deserving of his Academy Award. The children were naturals. Brock Peters (who passed away a few months ago) as Tom Robinson offers a plaintive and stirring performance. A young Robert Duvall, in his film debut, as the mute, gentle Boo Radley delivers a tremendous performance just with his eyes, facial expressions and body movement, saying more than some actors say in words, in a whole movie.I've also got to praise Universal Studios for getting this boxed DVD set right ""To Kill a Mockingbird (Legacy Series Edition)"". The 2005 release is a vast improvement over the 1998 version. On DVD 1, the film can be viewed with or without the director's comments. On DVD 1 and 2, there is a documentary on Gregory Peck, his family and friends, as well as archived clips dealing with ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". All are appropriately interspersed, adding genuine warmth and depth to the man who portrayed Atticus. Quite surprisingly, we discover the actor and character were in many ways one and the same person. Wait, this boxed set also comes with several postcards depicting various versions of the film's theatrical posters, which illustrate if anything how immensely popular the film was and remains to audiences around the world.In closing, I must say ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is at once an amazingly simple, yet profoundly universal story. Strip away its period setting of the 1930's; its occurrence in America's Deep South; and we realise the events could just as easily happen today, anywhere in the world, to anyone. Above all, it is a story that teaches the importance of fairness, justice, respect and love, for it is in these noble acts man learns to transcend his horrible propensity for prejudice, intolerance, ignorance and hatred.",5,"It would be a sin to miss ""To Kill A Mockingbird""",1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,5348,"['WOW', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'aboutTo', 'Kill', 'A',

As is mentioned in the accompanying DVD, Fearfull Symmetry, it is second only to the Bible in the hearts and minds of U.S. readers. This is probably also the most often-shown film in said classrooms. No need to reshash the story-line, then.This DVD set offers an excellent transfer of the famed black and white cinematography of the prolific Russel Harlan. It's a real treat to hear from so many of the people who were involved in the production, from the producer, Alan J. Pakula, to the now grown actors who played Scout and Jim. The audience gains great insights into what made this film so special, not only to the legions of its admiring fans, but to everyone involved in creating it. We learn the scenes that Horton Foote, the screenwriter added from the book to advance character development (the scene showing Atticus putting Scout to bed and her questioning Jim about their mother as Atticus overhears them from the porch, was not in the book, for instance). We get to hear from Elmer Bernstein talk about the genesis of his unforgettable soundtrack. Due credit is also given to Stephen Frankfurt, for his highly creative and original title design, which sets the tone so beatifully for the rest of the film.There is no question that this is director Robert Mulligan's greatest film, nor that in his portrayal of Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck found the role most perfectly suited to his character and rock-solid persona. This is a film about integrity, essentially, and there is not a false moment in the film. This compilation should be included in any film collector's library. I hope it continues to be shown in English classes until time immemorial. It's message and its relevance to the human condition will never go out of style, one hopes.

50505,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,0783222955,C. B Collins Jr.,"[4, 6]","To Kill a Mockingbird is certainly destined to be a classic of both American literature and American film-making, if it is not already. I would like to first discuss the novel from which the film was adapted. Then I will discuss the award winning film which can be obtained on DVD. Finally I will discuss the continued question about this work, which is whether it is a book for children or adults.Harper Lee's novel continues to stimulate debate. Whereas the debate was about morality and racial relationships when the novel was written, the debate of late is centered on whether Harper Lee wrote a book for adults written through the eyes of a child or whether her intention was to write a book for children/young adults. I know I read the book when I was in the eighth grade and found it to be wonderful.But maybe it was fantastic because I was 14 years old and the moral clarity and wise heroism of Atticus Finch seems very right to my adolescent sense of justice. The re-claiming of Bo Radley back into the world of the living also gives a message about rejection, acceptance, reclaiming the lost, and affection. The novel is full of wonderful experience and moral commentary as presented through the eyes of a 7 year old tom-boy, a technique Mark Twain used in many of his novels. Twain recommended this style in fact pointing out that the hypocracy and odd motives of adults can be commented upon through nieve eyes with a sense of wonder and delightful humor.The film, which captures poor rural Alabama perfectly, also was fantastic. Gegory Peck was outstanding, as were all the actors. The screen play is penetrating and tight, never letting the characters become cute country hicks. The black and white format with austere depression era sets compliments the actions, turning a residential street in a poor Alabama town into a microcosm of the world of good, bad, and misunderstood forces.But is it for children or adults?  Flannery O'Connor, the great writer, said that it amazed her that most adult readers didn't realize it was a children's book. This debate is re-introduced in the recent film ""Capote"" where a New York literary character asks Nelle Harper Lee at a cocktail party about the 'children's book' she had written and published. After a recent reviewing of the book and film, I find that the work actually has vast appeal to children, young adults, and adults. I don't mean this to be avoidance of answering the question, but the work has multiple levels of depth and moral instruction relevant to any age. The criticism that it is a children's book is usually based on the lack of moral ambiguity in the strong forceful wise character of Atticus Finch. However, he is surrounded by adults with quivering morality, including the county sherrif and a town full of persuadable white establishment.

The documentary, &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; produced in 1998 to be included on this DVD Collector's Edition, is great resource for teachers, students and all those who love and have been touched by &quot;Mockingbird.&quot;The 130 minute documentary, written and directed Charles Kiselyak, both discusses how the film was made and it's general literary elements.  The film is one of the most effectively edited documentaries I have seen, linking key scenes from &quot;Mockingbird&quot; with talking heads, still photos and black and white film taken in various localities across the south.The documentary narration, written by Charles Kiselyak and read with great emotion by Mary Williams, is literary and quite  sophisticated.The talking heads include: screenwriter Horton Foote, director Robert Mulligan, producer Allan J. Pakula and composer Elmer Bernstein.  Members of the cast appearing in the film: Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch), Phillip Alford (Jem), Mary Badham (Scout), Collin Wilcox (Maybella Ewell), Brock Peters (Tom Robinson) and Robert Duvall (Boo Radley).Director Charles Kiselyak with the help of Harper Lee was able to get three residents to discuss their lives in Monroeville, Alabama.  A.B. Blass and Norman Barnett recall life in the small town during the depression, and Ida Gaillard, a retired high school teacher, brings an interesting perspective to what life was (may have been) like in the town Harper Lee used as the model for Maycomb.The literary and social significance of the &quot;Mockingbird&quot; are discussed by black attorney, Cleophis Thomas, Jr., and Claudia Durst Johnson, author of &quot;Threatening Boundries.&quot;In the DVD's printed supplement, Charles Kiselyak indicates that while Harper Lee was not willing to appear in the documentary, she was very helpful in the production.  She was thrilled with the director's plan to open the documentary with the first verse one of her favorite poems, William Blake's, &quot;Tyger:&quot;Tyger, Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immoral hand or eye, Could frame they fearful symmetry,Kiselyak's film discusses Lee's novel as both a way of life and a passage from innocence into experience and then back toward innocence -- &quot;Fearful Symmetry.&quot;&quot;Mockingbird&quot; and it's DVD documentary will touch your soul.",5,Exceptional extra feature documentary...,985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,2609,"['so', 'many', 'teachers', ""'ve"", 'used', 'VHS', 'version', 'quot', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'quot', 'teach', 'Elements', 'Literature', 'high', 'school', 'students.Today', 'internet', 'wealth', 'resources', 'assist', 'teachers', 'students', 'using', 'classic', 'adaptation', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'novel', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Fearful', 'Symmetry', 'quot', 'produced', '1998', 'be', 'included', 'DVD', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'great', 'resource', 'teachers', 'students', 'who', 'love', 'have', 'been', 'touched', 'quot', 'Mockingbird.', 'quot', '130', 'minute', 'documentary', 'written', 'directed', 'Charles', 'Kiselyak', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'general', 'literary', 'elements', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'effectively', 'edited', 'documentaries', 'have', 'seen', 'linking', 'key', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Mockingbird', 'quot', 'talking', 'heads', 'still', 'photos', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'taken', 'various', 'localities', 'south.The', 'documentary', 'narration', 'written', 'Charles', 'Kiselyak', 'read', 'great', 'emotion', 'Mary', 'Williams', 'literary', 'quite', 'sophisticated.The', 'talking', 'heads', 'include', 'screenwriter', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'producer', 'Allan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'composer', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'Members', 'cast', 'appearing', 'film', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Phillip', 'Alford', 'Jem', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'Scout', 'Collin', 'Wilcox', 'Maybella', 'Ewell', 'Brock', 'Peters', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Boo', 'Radley', '.Director', 'Charles', 'Kiselyak', 'help', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'three', 'residents', 'discuss', 'lives', 'Monroeville', 'Alabama', 'A.B', 'Blass', 'Norman', 'Barnett', 'recall', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'depression', 'Ida', 'Gaillard', 'retired', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'town', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'used', 'model', 'Maycomb.The', 'literary', 'social', 'significance', 'quot', 'Mockingbird', 'quot', 'are', 'discussed', 'black', 'attorney', 'Cleophis', 'Thomas', 'Jr.', 'Claudia', 'Durst', 'Johnson', 'author', 'quot', 'Threatening', 'Boundries.', 'quot', 'DVD', 'printed', 'supplement', 'Charles', 'Kiselyak', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'was', 'not', 'willing', 'appear', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'helpful', 'production', 'was', 'thrilled', 'director', 'plan', 'open', 'documentary', 'first', 'verse', 'one', 'favorite', 'poems', 'William', 'Blake', 'quot', 'Tyger', 'quot', 'Tyger', 'Tyger', 'burning', 'bright', 'forests', 'night', 'What', 'immoral', 'hand', 'eye', 'Could', 'frame', 'fearful', 'symmetry', 'Kiselyak', 'film', 'Lee', 'novel', 'way', 'life', 'passage', 'innocence', 'experience', 'then', 'back', 'innocence', 'quot', 'Fearful', 'Symmetry.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mockingbird', 'quot', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'will', 'touch', 'soul']",N/A

To be &quot;different&quot; is to be isolated; it's an issue that embraces personality, ethnicity, skin color, economic level--everything, really. And this film deals with that matter on several levels. It is, to my mind Gregory Peck's more memorable performance, embodying as he does the ideals by which we can only try to live.

Gregory Peck offers what may be his definitive role (he won the Best-Actor Oscar for it after four fruitless nominations) and, perhaps, the most famous dad in film; as various critics have said, not even Peck himself was as good a father as Atticus Finch, but Atticus is probably what every dad wants to be.  Though slow in pace, the movie is never boring, and the picture it presents of the Deep South (Maycomb Co., Ala.) in the days before Martin Luther King is both fascinating and disturbing.  If, like me, you find yourself puzzled over why the Ewells faked a rape and accused Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) of the crime, your best bet is to read the book To Kill a Mockingbird, which also provides a lot of background about the Finches and their neighbors.

At least those of us lucky enough to have experienced the budding greatness of the 1962 film ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" There was a time, believe it or not, when director Robert Mulligan's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was considered trite and conventional.Many critics claimed Gregory Peck's Academy Award-winning honor for this film to be an acknowledgement of a long and fruitful career, rather than the individual performance. Unfortunately, this film was released during a time in American history when cultural change was on the horizon. The messages in this film, based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, were no longer considered relevant. They were lost in a sea of grainy TV footage showing Kennedy's assassination, the Vietnam war and Jimi Hendrix performing ""The Star Spangled Banner.""So I suppose it's not a surprise that ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" fell through the cracks. What a joy to see this film's reputation grow on an annual basis. Is there a single American film in history more deserving of lofty status than ""To Kill A Mockingbird?"" I say completely, without a moment's hestitation, that Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch is one of the greatest single performances in cinema history. It ranks with George C. Scott's performance in ""Patton,"" Robert De Niro's in ""The Raging Bull"" and Marlon Brando's in ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""Rarely has a role fit an actor so comfortably and believably as that of Atticus Finch with Gregory Peck. The moment arrived, the cosmos came together, and Peck gave the ultimate performance of a lifetime. It was a role which would forever define a man, if not a country. Today, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is required viewing for all children. In fact, it should be required viewing for all Americans. This film ultimately personifies all that is strong and decent within our troubled culture.There are really no villains in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" but there are deeply flawed men, women and children struggling with the changing tide of a complex society. In ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" this is our world, for better or for worse. Gregory Peck/Atticus Finch will eventually serve as a beacon for us all. His portrayal is a testament. It is an example of what we can truly be if we tap the best within mankind. There is not a single bad note in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" and a special note must be made for the heartbreaking performance of Brock Peters.I suppose it is telling that when watching this film as a child, I wanted to be like Atticus Finch - wrinkled white suit, gentle smile, respectful of tradition. One day, when my children watch this film, I have not a doubt they will feel the same way. This film, like the book, is exquistely timeless.

It is that, but so much more. ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is also a simple social commentary on racism, wonderfully and innocently seen through a child's eyes, and man's rejection of others he doesn't understand. The commentary, 40 years old now, remains as relevant as then. As southern lawyer Atticus Finch, Peck garnered a Best Actor Oscar for his powerfully moving performance that, as one scene elicits, also commands a deep respect of the screen character. As defense counsel for an African-American (a contemporary poltically correct term; then, they were ""coloreds"") man falsely accused of raping a white woman (not popular in the south), Peck evokes a sense of outrage at the injustice of his client's position. The genius of the film, though, is its perspective of Peck's screen daughter, Scout. And it is her innocent confusion in not understanding why her father becomes chastised by the white community that hopefully gets across the sublimial message that there is no understanding of any form of discrimination. Ranked the 34th best film ever by the American Film Institute, this one will remain always relevant as long as injustice based on discrimination exists.

It is a tale of growing up in a society that doesn't practice what it preaches (pun intended).

Have we truly become so enamored of our own self-serving interests that we can't see what it's doing to our world.I don't know about anyone one else, but aside from my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Atticus Finch, fictitious though he may be, is a personal role model for my life, and has been since I first read the book in third grade.

50542,A1FDW1SPYKB354,0783222955,David Von Pein,"[41, 47]","""To Kill A Mockingbird"" premiered in U.S. theaters on Christmas Day 1962. Those who were lucky enough to see this movie on the big screen that December 25th came out of the theater with another Yuletide gift of sorts -- they had just watched one of the finest motion pictures ever produced (IMHO).There probably aren't enough glowing adjectives in the dictionary to describe the loveliness of this film. A truly fabulous piece of American cinema -- all the way through -- with a tender and bittersweet ending that always leaves one of those ""trying to hold it back"" lumps in the ol' throat.The cast is ideal, with each actor seemingly molded for each of their individual roles. There's ""Scout"" (Mary Badham), ""Jem"" (Phillip Alford), ""Dill"" (John Megna), ""Boo Radley"" (Robert Duvall), and ""Tom Robinson"" (Brock Peters).And ""Atticus Finch"" (Gregory Peck), one of the truly most memorable characters ever brought to the screen. And it's hard to think of how Mr. Peck's Academy Award-winning portrayal of that southern lawyer and father could have possibly been any better than we see it here. Peck always seems to have that ""controlled"" quality in his movie performances that are always a pleasure to watch. And never more so than as the low-key ""Atticus"" in this film. I doubt that it's possible to watch this movie and NOT admire the strength of character and unwillingness to stoop to such levels of vulgarity after Atticus is spat upon by ""Bob Ewell"". It's one of several scenes in the film that illustrates the type of man Atticus is, and the type of example he's setting for his young children. Some might be apt to call Atticus a coward in that scene. But they'd be wrong.This film offers up many highly-memorable moments indeed --- Atticus sitting in front of the jail reading by the light of his living-room stand lamp. .... The mystery of Jem's ripped pants. .... Boo Radley's spooky house. .... Atticus impressing his children when he shoots the rabid dog. .... That old hollowed-out tree that keeps filling itself up with all kinds of cool stuff. .... ""Stand up, your father's passing"". .... Plus, that beautiful and stirring Elmer Bernstein music score. Utter magic.There's also a good deal of humor residing in this screenplay. I always get a good healthy laugh when viewing the scene which has Dill drenching his dinner in syrup, to the shock and dismay of Scout (""Look, Atticus! He's gone and drown-ded his dinner in syrup and now he's pourin' it all over!""). A true LOL moment that's always good for at least two replays. :-)And possibly the most memorable quote comes at the end of the film, when Atticus says to Scout: ""Miss Jean Louise -- Mister Arthur Radley"". With these few words, Scout's fears of ""Boo"" vanish forever. The dignity with which Atticus ""introduces"" Arthur (""Boo"") to Scout is what makes this quote memorable for me.Universal Studios Home Video, on September 6, 2005, issued a beautiful-looking new Two-Disc DVD version of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", which comes with a bountiful helping of bonus supplements, as well as the very first ""enhanced"" (Anamorphic) Widescreen transfer of the film on DVD.Packaged under its ""Legacy Series"" banner, this 2-Disc Set sparkles in virtually all respects, especially the video quality of this iconic black-and-white film. It looks very nearly perfect to my eyes. Very few distracting artifacts can be observed during the running of this 130-minute main feature (which is presented in its intended 1.85:1 Widescreen framing here). And the nighttime scenes are rendered in fine fashion, with next to no video annoyances visible at all. The film passes the ""Freeze Frame"" test as well -- i.e.: you can ""pause""/""still"" an image on screen in virtual perfect clarity, without the image blurring at all, which I usually take as a pretty good sign that what I'm seeing is a darn-good transfer of the material to DVD.There's a choice of five separate audio options for the feature film on Disc 1 -- with one of the five being a Commentary Track with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula, which was recorded for the first DVD edition of ""TKAM"" in 1998. Tragically, Pakula was killed in a freak auto accident in November of 1998, not too long after he recorded the commentary track for the DVD. He was 70 years old.Other audio options for this two-disc edition include the original English Mono (in 2.0 Dolby Digital), a French 2.0 DD Mono track, and two newly-created multi-channel 5.1 Surround audio tracks (a Dolby Digital 5.1 plus a DTS 5.1). The DTS track isn't listed in the specs on the packaging, however. But it IS on here.Audio tracks cannot be changed ""on the fly"" (as the saying goes) while watching the movie (unfortunately). You must go to the ""Languages"" Sub-Menu to switch the audio. To switch to the Commentary Track, you must access the ""Bonus Features"" Menu on Disc 1. There's no ""Commentary"" option available from the ""Languages"" Menu (for some reason).Subtitle options: English, French, and Spanish. .... These subtitle choices are also ALL available when viewing any of the Bonus Features throughout this two-disc DVD set (including even the movie's trailer).A bonus item that was originally scheduled to be a part of this set, but was ultimately not included, is a replica of Gregory Peck's ""working script"" (with handwritten notes by Peck). That bonus was evidently replaced by the 11 ""Theatrical Poster Reproductions"" that are included here. These poster art copies are very nice, being re-printed on high-quality paperboard stock, which have a glossy look to them. Included are a few USA poster copies, plus several from foreign nations, like Argentina, Japan, Italy, Poland, among others. The artwork's country of origin is printed on the back of each of these reproduction prints. A well-done extra bonus, IMO. (Although I would have loved to have had Mr. Peck's working TKAM script too. But, oh well.)Also in the envelope with the 11 poster re-prints is a signed message from ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" author Harper Lee.Let's have a look at the DVD Bonus Features.............Disc 1:> Gregory Peck's acceptance speech after he won the Oscar trophy as ""Best Actor 1962"" (the only Oscar statue he was ever to take home, amazingly enough). This vintage 1963 B&W; video clip runs for 1:28.> Excerpt from the ""Academy Tribute To Gregory Peck"", with Gregory's daughter Cecilia. This is a 10-minute bonus item.> ""American Film Institute Life Achievement Award"" presented to Gregory Peck. Run Time: 10 minutes.> ""Scout Remembers"", which is a 1999 NBC-TV interview with ""Scout"" herself (Mary Badham). This bonus runs 12 minutes. .... Mary Badham, for those who may not know it, is the sister of John Badham, who directed such motion pictures as ""WarGames"" (in 1983) and the enormously-popular and successful John Travolta film ""Saturday Night Fever"" (in 1977).> The Original Theatrical Trailer for ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (Length: 2:53). The trailer is in Full Frame (1.33:1) format. Excellent sound quality too. Video quality is lacking a bit, but it's not too bad.> Production Notes. (Text screens only.)The only thing missing here are the ""Cast And Filmmaker"" bio text pieces that were included on the '98 disc. Too bad, too, because those biography notes were quite good (and extensive), and covered several of the various TKAM players and execs.Disc 2:There are two first-rate documentaries on the second disc of this set. These two extra DVD programs amount to 3 hours and 7 minutes of added ""Mockingbird"" entertainment, pretty much the equivalent of two entire additional movies.The Disc-Two programs are:> ""Fearful Symmetry: The Making Of 'To Kill A Mockingbird'"" (90 minutes; B&W; Non-Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 24 Chapter Stops). .... This is the same feature-length, behind-the-scenes documentary that was also included on the earlier DVD release of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". Wonderful stuff here. Lots of interesting details about how this classic film got to the screen. Includes many on-camera comments by Gregory Peck. Produced in 1998.-- And: --> ""A Conversation With Gregory Peck"" (97 minutes; Color & B&W; Full Frame 1.33:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 18 Chapter Stops). .... This sensational movie-length documentary was produced by Gregory Peck's daughter (Cecilia) in 1999. It is a very nicely-constructed presentation, with a good music score too, which delves in great depth into the personal side of the great Gregory Peck, who proves here that he was still more than capable of holding an audience's undivided attention at age 83.This documentary could very easily have been called ""Gregory Peck's Life: In His Own Words"". It's quite literally a biography on the personal life and movie career of Mr. Peck. It's certainly one of the best ""bio"" pieces I've ever seen on the life of any actor.This ""docu-bio"" contains video clips of many of Peck's films, plus old home movies, several talk-show clips featuring Gregory, and lots of other interesting stuff that help to give even more insight into the life of this amazing American actor (who was born in California on April 5, 1916).Gregory Peck takes center stage during portions of the program (literally), as he talks and jokes with large audiences around the United States, and conducts various Q&A; sessions.There's lots of candid footage of Peck (and family) here too, including some impressive shots taken at Niagara Falls. And in Paris, too. And Ireland. And in Washington, D.C., as Gregory gets an award from then-President Bill Clinton.Near the end of this thoroughly-engaging bio/""Conversation"", we see proud granddaddy Gregory holding his just-born grandson (who was named ""Harper"", after TKAM author Harper Lee). The scenes of Little Harper will make you want to reach into your TV and scoop up this adorable munchkin. He's one of the cutest little tykes I've ever laid eyes on. It's no wonder Gregory looks so proud here. These tender scenes with Gregory and his new grandson add the perfect sweet and sentimental finishing touches to the whole documentary.This ""Conversation"" bonus is a genuinely unique program. It was produced with an obvious large dose of love and affection by Mr. Peck's daughter (and all others who were involved in putting it together). After viewing it, you can't help but feel like you know (and admire) a man named Eldred Gregory Peck quite a bit better than you did just ninety-seven minutes earlier. And that might be the best compliment I can pay this very special and heart-warming documentary.Mr. Peck passed away in June of 2003, four years after he filmed this program. He was 87. He will be missed forever by multiple generations of movie fans who loved his work in the cinema for many decades. His talent is one that we'll likely not run across again, until we reach heaven. But thank goodness for fabulous documentaries like this one, plus all of his cherished films as well, which enable fans to retouch the magic and greatness that will forever be associated with Mr. Gregory Peck.----------------The packaging for this ""Legacy Series"" edition has a very solid and collectible feel to it. It's a three-panel folding ""Digipak"" type of a case, which sports an attractive ""leathery"" texture on the outside of the case. Unfortunately, there's no outer slipcase box (sleeve) included here, which will probably displease some collectors who wish to display this set ""face out"". That'll pose a small problem, because the case always wants to ""spring"" back open (due to the lack of a restraining outer slipcase). An outer box would certainly have been useful, but even without one, this package stands out as a ""classy"" DVD item on the shelf.Additional Packaging Note -- This ""Mockingbird"" set is not packaged the same as ""The Sting"" (another Universal 2-Disc Legacy set). ""The Sting"", which is also worthy of a purchase IMO, comes in a two-panel ""book-like"" pack, which ""snaps"" firmly closed on the outside -- just like the ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" 2-Disc Limited-Edition DVD release, which came out in April 2001.For continuity sake, I would have preferred the ""Sting"" type of closeable Digipak for the TKAM release. The two sets would look better side-by-side if they'd been packed the same. But, no big deal really.Both the ""TKAM"" and ""Sting"" Legacy versions lack any Chapter List inserts or paper enclosures (which is a bit of a debit). However, if you own the previously-released single-disc DVD ""Collector's Edition"" of ""Mockingbird"", I'd recommend hanging on to the excellent multi-page fold-out insert that came with that disc. It can be used with this new DVD set as well. It has a complete Chapter Selection listing for both the movie and the ""Fearful Symmetry"" documentary, and the chapter breaks are in the exact same spots on this newer Legacy version, with the same chapter titles used as well (39 total Scenes/Chapters for the Main Feature). There are also some interesting Production Notes and photographs printed on that 1998 TKAM insert.Also -- Make sure to disregard the ""Color"" notation marked on the loose piece of paper on the back of the DVD case that lists this ""Legacy"" set's contents. The film is in B&W;, not color. That's obviously just a misprint.----------------A Final Glowing Blurb.......""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a masterpiece of personally-felt moods and memories. Who among us doesn't have at least one childhood memory that can be rekindled through the actions of Scout, Jem, or Dill? This is a motion picture you can watch again and again -- and each time take away something different when that incomparable final act fades to black (usually something that requires yet another hard swallow with which to combat that ever-present lump in the throat that this movie masterfully induces each and every time it's watched).Any DVD collection of great American motion pictures is unquestionably incomplete if ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" does not occupy a prominent position on the shelf reserved for such magnificent movie treasures.",5,"One Of The Greatest Films Ever To Reach The Screen! ...

Since then I have read the book a few more times and seen the movie probably another 50 times. In recent years many of the movie collections are combined with interviews with the original cast. One of my favorites is with Gregory Peck. Peck often said that the role of Atticus Finch was his very favorite role in his long career as an actor. Many will remember that when Brock Peters delivered the eulogy at Peck's funeral that he remembered Peck as a man who lived his life every day as Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck has always been one of my very favorite actors so this had great meaning for me to know that someone actually lead a principled life away from the stage.The characters in the book are all very realistic for any community, not just a southern community. Racism and prejudice made be bolder and more pronounced in the south but it can be found anywhere.The book is also an oustanding example of how to weave a story and interact the characters.

With respect to Atticus Finch, Peck merely enhances an extraordinarily good film, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based on Harper Lee's phenomenal and timelessnovel.  I've read the book and seen the movie, many times; experiencing both are extremely rewarding.  In particular, the film works marvelously, for several reasons.For openers, Horton Foote penned a riveting screenplay, while director Robert Mulligan brings Lee's novel to vivid life.  The film is blessed with very believable child actors in Mary Badham (Scout) and Phillip Alford (Jem), who both made their silver screen debuts.  The supporting cast is spectacular, including a grisly, disheveled James Anderson playing villain Bob Ewell and a very young Robert Duvall playing reclusive Boo Radley.  Add to that Peck's commanding performance as a widowed lawyer and father of two children in the Jim Crow South during the Great Depression, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a movie for the ages.  Highly recommended for all movie collectors and cinema buffs.--D.

It effectively conveys the leisurely Southern summers and Tom Sawyerish feel of Lee's youth. Drawing parallels between the fears of children and adults, the movie shows us that we don't necessarily grow up when we reach adulthood. In the end, those of us who do mature find that there is often beauty on the other side of that mysterious door; and &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; shows us some of the possibilities.Relying on the acting talents of several children doesn't hamper the picture's effectiveness one bit. On the contrary, it's one of the film's surprising strengths.

50568,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0783222955,Ed Uyeshima,"[13, 13]","Having just read Charles Shields' biography of Harper Lee, ""Mockingbird"", and re-read her classic (and only) novel for at least the third time, I was able recently to watch Robert Mulligan's 1962 classic film adaptation with fresh eyes, and the 2005 Legacy Series Edition DVD fortunately contains a pristine print transfer and a bundle of extras that make repeated viewings more than worthwhile. Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance. Set in the Deep South of Lee's childhood in the fictional town of Maycomb in 1932, the story, adapted by writer Horton Foote, focuses on six-year old Scout, the tomboy, motherless daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch.Along with her four-years older brother Jem, Scout regales the new neighbor boy Dill with horror stories about the bleak-looking Radley house and its chief occupant, ""Boo"", whom they believe has been locked up in the basement. Finch, in the meantime, has been given the unenviable task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella, the cry-wolf daughter of a white trash racist farmer, Bob Ewell. The two stories meld seamlessly with the model behavior of Finch, who tries to teach his children not to come to judgment based on hearsay and perception. Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing. Because of the town's pervasive racism, Finch loses the case, and tragic consequences ensue. However, life lessons for the children emerge as well as ""Boo"" in an unexpected heroic act.Gregory Peck gives his career-best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human-sized dimensions to a most honorable man. It's inspiring work from a great screen legend. Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem. Brock Peters plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as ""Boo"" Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voiceover for the grown-up Scout ne&eacute; Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get.The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J. Pakula, a superb director in his own right. There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom-seen Badham, and the original theatrical trailer.The second disc offers a fascinating, ninety-minute 1998 documentary, ""Fearful Symmetry"", filmed effectively in black-and-white, which goes well beyond the standard making-of featurette.

It is a coming of age story about children learning the ways of the adult world (both good and bad), and also learning about the honor and faith their father, lawyer Atticus Finch, has in the justice system, demonstrated by his villigent defense of his current client, a young black man wrongly accused of rape.  It's also a moral and humanitarian story about making an effort to dissuade misconceptions about race and &quot;family values.&quot;  Lastly, and in a smaller form, it is a film about redemption.  What you think you know about someone can change dramatically when they do something seemingly out of the ordinary...like saving your life.  Atticus Finch tells his daughter that &quot;you never know what a person is really like until you take a moment to step in their shoes for a little while.&quot;  It's pretty simple, but powerful stuff.What I think is really distinct about this film is that the children's characterizations are treated with such sensitivity.  It could become easy to treat the daily nuances of a child's imagination and naivite as something silly or unimportant.  Their characters are aided by fantastic performances by the young actors, Mary Badham and Philip Adford.  Gregory Peck gives one of the most memorable performances I can imagine.  His portrayal is understated and touching, eventually leading up to his character's fierce determination in the final courtroom scene, where he lays out the injustices that have plagued his client.  It's one of the finest courtroom scenes in American film history, encapsulating both the strength of what the justice system of America represents and also portraying the fervent racial tensions that were dividing the nation at the time of the film's release (1962).And it all works tremendously well.  Some of the most poignant moments in the film were so subtle.  The part where I lost it was when, after Finch was handed a defeat by the jurors, he slowly starts gathering up his paperwork as the courtroom floor empties.  But the second floor (of black townspeople-in awe of his defense) stand and watch as he gets ready to leave.  Reverend Sykes quietly tells Atticus' son Jem to stand up, in a way to hommage the man who stood up for his own beliefs and the defense of not just a single man accused, but a whole community.  It was a really sensitive visual statement that conveyed a powerful sentiment about the perpetual state of race in America.  And I was crying big-time!  And the final scene, in which we find out the true personality of Boo Radley, was really suprising and touching.  It really makes you think about the how extraordinary the human spirit can be, and how making snap judgements about other people really doesn't pay off in the end.I just saw the film for the first time tonight, and it is now one of my all time favorites.

When the author of To Kill a Mockingbird first saw Gregory Peck she was not convinced that he was the man to play the central role of Atticus Finch, indeed she thought him too young. But when she first saw Gregory Peck playing Atticus she remarked that it was like seeing her beloved ""Daddy"". When you watch Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch, he is so natural in the role, that you sense that he was born to play this role.This film's screenplay adaptation of Harper Lee's book concentrates mainly on the courtroom scenes. But this film also considers other elements from the book too, including the relationship between the three children Scout, Jem and Dill with Boo Radley. Look out for the scene where the children decide to investigate the Radley home under the cover of darkness, the courtroom scene where Atticus appeals to the jury and the scene where Scout stops a murder intent mob in it's tracks. Though shot in black and white this does not rob the film of it's impact, indeed I felt the lack of colour gives the film a raw power all of its own. Furthermore, I guarantee that after watching this film you will want to read or indeed reread the book.Both Gregory Peck's father and Harper Lee's father had sadly died soon after the end of production.

The book took me for a ride as a child, one of those rare books we were made to read in school that I could not put down; the film, with exemplary performances by Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Brock Peters, is a searing treatise on social mores of the time and it still speaks to us today. We have not come all that far from the era portrayed in the film, and it should be shown in schools; it is that good.Scout (Mary Badham), a precocious child, runs pretty much unchecked through the small Southern town in which she is raised, tolerated by the townsfolk because her father is Atticus Finch, a well-respected attorney; and really, she is looked upon with affection by most, who feel sorry for her because her mother died. She only has time to ruminate on that occasionally, as she and her older brother Jem, and a visiting boy there for the summer, get into all sorts of adventures against the backdrop of her father's preparing to defend a local black man on trial for the alleged rape of a young white woman. There are those in town who can smell a frame clearly enough, but this is the South, and a charge brought by a white against a black is going to have dismally predictable results. Atticus, who knows his client is innocent, forges ahead anyway, facing down intimidation and threats to his children, and building up the film to a crescendo of an ending. The ending of the movie - and scattered references throughout the film - introduced us, also, to Robert Duvall, as he just began his film career; and though his part is small, it is wrenchingly powerful.The highest recommendation possible.

Furthermore, this film covered the issue of prejudice when it was still a very explosive subject to many people. Adapted from Harper Lee's classic, this film has a lot of things going for it. This includes a touching story and on of the greatest heroes of all time. It follows the recollections of Scout (Mary Badham) as she remembers her childhood with her older brother Jem and their widowed, lawyer father Atticus. The plot revolves most importantly around the trial of a black man for an accused rape of a white girl. The only man willing to defend Tom Robinson is Atticus because he feels it is the right thing to do.

50578,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,0783222955,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 1]","To Kill a Mockingbird, as other reviewers have noted, is probably not only one of the significant novels of our time, but also one of the most important movies. It is easy to see why this film resonates with the vast majority who see it, and why it consistently gets mentioned with being one of the 100 best films of all time. It is a rarity to have a film live up to a book, not only in its adaptation, but also how we visualize the story taking place. Producer (Alan J. Pakula) and director (Robert Mulligan) put together a perfect version of Harper Lee's novel, from the mood, music score, cinematography, and cast, who all personify the characters in the book. Gregory Peck was a perfect fit for Atticus Finch, as his taciturn manner, his stoic mood, and his unflinching attitude towards his principles is depicted with such precision. The young children cast as Scout and Jem also give fine performances.The film itself explores the theme of racial injustice and conflict in the South, but also the essence of believing and doing something because it is the right thing to do, and sticking with it until the end. In this case, Atticus Finch is the lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson, a black man charged with rape, knowing full well that it isn't the popular decision in the Maycomb community, and that ultimately, he and his children will have to pay for it through insults, gossip and general Southern ""inhospitality"". Still, Atticus sticks to his guns, and doesn't let this get the best of him, a lesson that Jem and Scout learn as the film progresses. Gossiping neighbors whisper, not approving of what Atticus is doing. Atticus Finch has several conflicts with Bob Ewell, a trashy member of the community whose prejudice is evidenced when he spits on Atticus, calls him a derogatory term, and then seeks revenge later. As a result of Atticus' strong principles, Jem, his son, and Scout, his daughter, see the world through realistic viewpoints (albeit the ugliness of society's views on race becomes apparent). The children endure taunts from classmates and even relatives about their father defending Tom Robinson and, as the trail unfolds, the ugliness of class and racial injustice surfaces. Jem and Scout experience a coming of age; their innocent world view is contradicted by these unsettling events. The subplot of To Kill a Mockingbird concerns Boo Radley, a recluse who lives nearby, but has not been seen in years. Rumors swirl about Boo, usually involving something to do with his apparent ""craziness"", but there is no real proof, and Jem and Scout are left to their own imaginings. However, a significant event changes their perception of him and the world; they are able, as Atticus puts, see things from another person's perspective.This DVD is a wonderful tool also for any teacher who teaches the novel in high school, as the film is faithful to the book, including many essential scenes, so it is easy to read parts of the novel and then follow these with the film. Also included is a fantastic documentary which examines the making of the film, as well as interviews with several of the actors, such as Gregory Peck. All in all, this is one of the best films ever made, and a fantastic DVD to own.",5,"A film that lives up to the book, and so much more",1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,3235,"['Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'probably', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'significant', 'novels', 'time', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'movies', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'vast', 'majority', 'who', 'see', 'why', 'consistently', 'mentioned', 'being', 'one', '100', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'rarity', 'have', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'book', 'not', 'only', 'adaptation', 'also', 'how', 'visualize', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'Producer', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'put', 'together', 'perfect', 'version', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'novel', 'mood', 'music', 'score', 'cinematography', 'cast', 'who', 'personify', 'characters', 'book', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'taciturn', 'manner', 'stoic', 'mood', 'unflinching', 'attitude', 'principles', 'depicted', 'such', 'precision', 'young', 'children', 'cast', 'Scout', 'Jem', 'also', 'give', 'fine', 'performances.The', 'film', 'theme', 'racial', 'injustice', 'conflict', 'South', 'also', 'essence', 'believing', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'sticking', 'end', 'case', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'lawyer', 'who', 'case', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'black', 'man', 'charged', 'rape', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', ""n't"", 'popular', 'decision', 'Maycomb', 'community', 'ultimately', 'children', 'will', 'have', 'pay', 'insults', 'gossip', 'general', 'Southern', 'inhospitality', 'Still', 'Atticus', 'guns', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'best', 'lesson', 'Jem', 'Scout', 'learn', 'film', 'Gossiping', 'neighbors', 'whisper', 'not', 'approving', 'what', 'Atticus', 'doing', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'several', 'conflicts', 'Bob', 'Ewell', 'trashy', 'member', 'community', 'prejudice', 'evidenced', 'when', 'Atticus', 'derogatory', 'term', 'then', 'revenge', 'later', 'result', 'Atticus', 'strong', 'principles', 'Jem', 'son', 'Scout', 'daughter', 'see', 'world', 'realistic', 'viewpoints', 'ugliness', 'society', 'views', 'race', 'becomes', 'apparent', 'children', 'endure', 'taunts', 'classmates', 'even', 'relatives', 'father', 'defending', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'trail', 'unfolds', 'ugliness', 'class', 'racial', 'injustice', 'surfaces', 'Jem', 'Scout', 'experience', 'coming', 'age', 'innocent', 'world', 'view', 'contradicted', 'unsettling', 'events', 'subplot', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'concerns', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'recluse', 'who', 'nearby', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'years', 'Rumors', 'swirl', 'Boo', 'usually', 'involving', 'something', 'do', 'apparent', 'craziness', 'real', 'proof', 'Jem', 'Scout', 'are', 'left', 'own', 'imaginings', 'However', 'significant', 'event', 'changes', 'perception', 'world', 'are', 'able', 'Atticus', 'see', 'things', 'person', 'perspective.This', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'tool', 'also', 'teacher', 'who', 'novel', 'high', 'school', 'film', 'faithful', 'book', 'including', 'many', 'essential', 'scenes', 'easy', 'read', 'parts', 'novel', 'then', 'follow', 'film', 'Also', 'included', 'fantastic', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'several', 'actors', 'such', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'own']",N/A

I just saw the Spanish edition of this blu-ray, which I assume to be the same, digibook included. I guess Universal has released the same transfer everywhere, so this can apply to all blu-ray edtions of this wonderful movie. Even though Harper Lee's book is of course denser in detail and much richer, which always happens because books and movies are different media, I still think it is a fairly good, unpretentious, touching adaptation. I usually dislike kids in US movies, but these are truly an exception, they are just adorable. All actors are outstanding, and of course Gregory Peck's understating acting is truly exceptional. Not to mention the very brief, breathtaking appearence by Robert Duvall at the end of the movie. Elmer Berstein's score is a true classic, simply marvelous. The photography is also beautiful but...yes, the transfer is, once more, fairly disappointing. They have abused DNR once more and the result, although not as badly preposterous as, let's say, ""Sleepy Hollow"" or ""Out of Africa"", is still quite sad. Details are lost, borders appear blurry at times, and, most sadly of all, faces are rather waxy, very waxy at times. I just don't understand the obsession for getting rid of the celulloid grain, which was a natural part of movies for many decades; it was the way these wonderful movies were shot and watched in theaters for generations. Comparison with other black & white classics on blu-ray such as ""Night of the hunter"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"" enhances all that is miserably lost in this one. A real shame. One would think that after the ""Gladiator"" affair, which had to be re-released with a new remastering toning donwn the DNR, this mistake would never be made again. But it does seem Universal is getting pretty good at spoiling wonderful movies. After watching the short documentary ""100 years of Universal: restoring the classics"" one feels really sorry that so much effort and care is spoiled at the very end with the absurd DNR obsession. They are even proud of removing the natural celulloid grain, and, gee, that is really upsettting!! Specially in the samples from this very movie, where you can see faces loosing detail and turning waxy as they show the restoration in process...One also fears the worst for future releases.

People tend to hate and seek to destroy that which they don't understand just because it scares them and the children learn at the end that the best way to overcome this fear is to face it head on and to seek to learn and understand rather than to judge and destroy.  At the end, this is what Scout does as she befriends the feared Boo who saves her brother's life.  We all naturally love to support the underdog and this film tells the story of Atticus fighting for justice and teaching his kids as he does so by his actions as well as his words.This dvd has an excellent documentary about the film as well as good interviews with the cast and crew as they look back at their experiences while making the film.

Houpt,"[1, 1]","Perhaps somewhere in the very far future when African Americans and Caucasian Americans have finally learned to see each other as brothers and sisters and not a human of color, then looking back on this film will seem strange and wistful. Until that time, we can do no better than to sit down and read the book and then watch this perfect movie adaptation.There are other great books and movies that cover the depression years in America. ""Grapes of Wrath"" comes to mind. Harper Lee's book and this film focus not on the displaced as much as how one person can rise to the occasion, show a strong moral spine and true courage. It would have been too simple to say that the film was about prejudice. Coming to the screen as it did during the rising cauldron of the Civil Rights movement, this film was a perfect mirror for the haunting specter that refused to shed its shadow over the south. In the aftermath of the ruinous Civil War, southern states, especially the Carolina's which led the revolt, suffered very badly during and after the war. In some places poverty and destitution never left the land. What did people do to get by in the depression era? Did they fall back on old ways and use scapegoats to satisfy the blame game? Certainly and that is where the story here begins.The audience watching this film in 1962 was familiar with prejudice but rarely had it seen a white man treat an African American with respect and a resolute commitment to seeking justice. There are other sinister themes that rise to the surface. The implication of a daughter being beaten by a drunken father, the taboo of a white woman seducing a black man, the injustice done to a mentally handicapped man by shuttering him like a prisoner in his own home; these are all hot buttons that would have made an audience squirm and disquiet their comfort zones. Even more ugly was the false accusation of an honest man, a person that was expected to be found guilty even by his own peers simply because he was a visible minority; this was the deep south and prejudice was so widespread.The richness of the story gives depth and detail to the lives of Atticus Finch and his fiercely independent children as they explore their lives. With several subplots swirling around the main trial, the audience is given constant stimulation in vivid colors of human drama. Shot in black and white and blessed with a superb script, one of the greatest male actors in the English speaking world, a sublime musical score by Elmer Bernstein, two child actors who were so natural that they became Atticus's children in a real way.....this film is iconic in American cinema and for so many good reasons. Perhaps Gregory Peck's greatest role, this film is unforgettable and has taken on a tinge of greatness that is entirely worthy of its craft. If you must own one Peck film, this is the one.

The editorial review and the opinion of the American Film Institute should say enough about the superiority of this work. Every actor gives a flawless performance. Atticus Finch is Gregory Peck's finest roll and his performance lives up to character. All the children are simply amazing. One performance that seems to get virtually no attention in reviews is Collin Wilcox Paxton as Mayella Violet Ewell. Ms. Paxton draws together an astounding collection of emotions and releases them in one to the most intense and frightening performances I have seen in any film. I remember seeing the film as a pre-teen (when it was new), and Ms. Paxton's anguished, screaming face is the image that is most vividly burned in my memory. She scared the bejeezers out of me.There simply can be no reasonable rating less than 5 stars for this flawless classic. So I was curious to find out why some people would give it less!?! I scanned through all the reviews and found only a handful who, I feel, had legitimate reasons for giving 4 stars because they felt the DVD transfer was flawed.I was amazed to find other reasons. Several school kids who had been forced to watch (and read) ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" who thought it was boring. Perhaps this says something about our schools, no? And maybe it says more about television.Some people were upset because it was not in color. They were unable to get over their disappointment and see the movie as it is. It was made in black and white at a time when Technicolor ruled the screen. There is clearly a very specific artistic reason Robert Mulligan chose black and white. He made the right choice. The sense of the dusty, dry, poor depression era is beautifully reinforced by the black and white presentation.But the most amazing review was one person that said ""Racism still serves a purpose...""!! Wow! I guess there are still Bob Ewells among us!""Too Kill a Mockingbird"" is without doubt one of the finest examples of American filmmaking.

50587,ANNQ5O2341T1R,0783222955,George,"[2, 3]","We watched this DVD once again, but on a note of sadness.We mourn Gregory Peck's passing, June 12, 2003.Look no further than this film for the full measure of his talent, and a good glimpse at the kind of man he was in real life. It is fitting that he lived just long enough to know of the honor bestowed on his character Atticus Finch, named Greatest Hero in film by the American Film Institute .  While mortal in life, he is immortal in film. So long, Greg!This DVD treats this classic film very well indeed, though some will always want for more extra features.  The picture is beautiful, the sound is good, the ""making-of"" retrospective is wonderful -- a must for your film library!  I'm not sure why they put colorized stills on the DVD box cover; it is a black and white film, but please don't let that stop you!I have always thought this film deserved a better place on AFI's list of top films than #34, such as the top 10. It is as fine a two-hour distillation of Harper Lee's great American novel as you could ever ask for -- a beautiful, elegant film that exactly captures the spirit and essence of time and place and character. Fabulous direction, photography, editing, writing, acting, and music come together seamlessly in a perfect, tight fabric. It is an astounding achievement in screenplay based on such a novel.  Of course the novel is far better, more complete, but it is a great film on its own merits.Harper Lee shows us the beauty and contradictions and ugliness in Southern culture as no one has before or since. She shows us her disappointment in and revulsion of aspects of her white Southern heritage, while at the same time showing us her great pride in a culture that is so rich and so beautiful when it throws off the ugly cloak of hatred and discrimination (take note, all ye ""proud"" wavers of the Confederate battle flag). Human arrogance and selfishness have wrought such evils, in this case from slavery to civil war to the desire for vengeance and scapegoats, often (and still) in the name of God. Let us learn from our history, improve ourselves, and sin no more.Buy this film, watch this film, love this film.  Be Atticus Finch!",5,"""Miss Jean Louise, stand up.

50596,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,0783222955,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[0, 0]","""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of the finest stories ever put on film; and the hero of that story, Atticus Finch (who is played by the incomparable Gregory Peck), has to be one of the most admirable characters ever portrayed on the silver screen.  If I could give this move more than five stars, I would.  But, since I can only give it five stars, I'll have to be content with that.  But please note that my five-star rating is for the movie itself, not for the special features included on this disc, which I found to be something of a letdown, in all honesty.  (More on this later.)  But the movie itself deserves the highest rating I can give it.  It is a cinematic masterpiece that everyone ought to see.In 1960, Harper Lee (a childhood friend of celebrated writer Truman Capote), published her only novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", which was based loosely on her own childhood memories of growing up in the small, sleepy, Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, during the Great Depression.  Lee maintains that the novel is not autobiographical, since many of the events it depicts are fictional; but the setting and characters are based on the places and people she knew as a child.  The narrator, Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, is based on Harper Lee herself.  Scout's devoted father, the respected local attorney, Atticus Finch, is based on Lee's own father, who was a lawyer.  And Dill Harris, the boy who spent his summers living at his aunt's house next door to the Finches, is based on Truman Capote.  Even the reclusive Radley family, who rarely ventured outside of their spooky, boarded-up house down the street from the Finches, is based on an actual family who lived near the Lees.  They, too, had a mysterious son they kept hidden from view because they were ashamed of him, just like Boo Radley in the novel.  In fact, most of the characters in the novel were based, at least loosely, on real people Harper Lee knew as a child.  Perhaps that's part of the reason why this story feels so real.  The portrait that Lee paints of life in the Depression-era Deep South is not only realistic, but vivid and nuanced.  She is able to honestly portray the hardships of poverty and the evils of racism that she witnessed as a child without ever crossing the line into caricature, and without in any way undermining her nostalgic portrayal of the magical innocence of childhood.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" became a runaway bestseller, and ended up winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.  And, even though the plot of the novel was not obviously well-suited to be adapted for the silver screen, it was made into a major motion picture the following year, with one of the biggest names in Hollywood, Gregory Peck, as its star.  The movie wasn't able to depict everything that happened in the book, of course.  (No movie ever can.)  But we are fortunate that the talented screenwriter, Horton Foote, was able to find the essence of the story in Harper Lee's novel and turn it into a brilliant screenplay.  What we end up with is a film that doesn't feel like a typical Hollywood movie.  Instead, it feels more like an actual look at someone's bittersweet memories of childhood.I'm no literary critic; so I won't even attempt to plumb the depths of this story.  It's far too rich for even a cursory exploration of its many themes in a review such as this.  But I do want to comment very briefly on what I believe to be the single greatest thing about this story: the character of Atticus Finch.  There are few people I can think of -- either in the real world or in works of fiction -- who are even remotely as admirable as Atticus Finch.  I find it hard to even imagine a better role model for a young person (especially a young man) to emulate.  He represents, at least in my view, the ideal father, the ideal lawyer, the ideal citizen, the ideal gentleman, and perhaps even the ideal human being.  As a father, he sets a good example for his children, treats them with respect and kindness, nurtures them, allows them a measure of independence, encourages their curiosity, answers their questions as honestly as he can, tries his best to instill in them the right values, and gently explains things to them rather than lecturing them or yelling at them.  As a lawyer, he has the highest possible standards of ethics and integrity, genuine compassion for his clients, a non-cynical respect for the law, and a commitment to justice.  As a citizen, he is dutiful, respectful, trustworthy, hospitable, neighborly, tolerant, and unbigoted.  As a gentleman, he is humble, peaceable, dignified, self-controlled, stalwart, courageous, and polite.  And, as a human being, he is virtuous, kind, empathetic, hopeful, and wise.  I wish I were even half the man that Atticus Finch is.  The world would be a much better place if it had more Atticus Finches in it.This is a movie that everyone ought to watch.  Not only is it a good story, with wonderful characters and a fascinating setting; but it also has some great lessons to teach about life, and about what it means to be a decent, honorable person.  Everyone needs to be exposed to the example of Atticus Finch, who is one of the noblest heroes ever portrayed on film.  I can't praise this movie highly enough; nor can my words do justice to it.  You've simply got to see it for yourself.Unfortunately, my five-star review has to come with this caveat:  While the movie itself is great, the special features on this disc are, at least in my view, underwhelming at best.  The documentary ""Fearful Symmetry"", which tells the story of the real-life people and places behind the novel, and how the novel was turned into a movie, is pretty interesting. And, being a total geek, I actually enjoyed the mini documentary on film restoration that was included on this disc, which showed how various old movies, including ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", have been restored for digital release on DVD and Blu-ray.  But the other special features didn't really appeal to me all that much.  I think that Gregory Peck was a brilliant actor and an admirable human being; but the Gregory Peck hagiography on this disc simply went too far, in my opinion.  The special features included with this motion picture should have been about the movie itself, or about Harper Lee's story, rather than about the star of the film.  But four of the nine special features on this disc were about the life and career of Gregory Peck, and a fifth (an interview with Mary Badham, who played Scout in the movie) spent more time talking about what a great person Gregory Peck was than about anything else.  For starters, there was a feature-length documentary that Peck's daughter co-produced, chronicling her father's reminiscences during his later years when he went on tour holding Q&A; sessions before live audiences, which I might have enjoyed had it been edited down to a more reasonable length of half-an-hour or so, but which was simply exhausting at its actual running time of 97 minutes.  In addition to this there were two very short clips showing Gregory Peck giving acceptance speeches, first for his Best Actor Oscar for his performance in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", and second for his Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.  He didn't really have much to say on either occasion; so I'm not sure why these were included.  But what really puzzled me was the inclusion of a poor-quality, amateur video recording of Peck's daughter speaking at a ceremony honoring her late father after his death.  I found these special features a bit disappointing.  But they can't take away from the overall quality of the movie.  I seriously doubt that anyone bases their decision about whether or not to buy a movie on the quality of the special features included on the disc.  Even if there were no special features on this disc at all, the movie would still be worth buying; and I highly recommend it.",5,One of the best movies ever made -- everyone needs to see

50603,A3MEHHL9LNKW4Z,0783222955,Herb Reeves,"[8, 9]","Why ban them? Then, we might be spared what is possibly the most infantile, ignorant and uninformed collection of negative reviews present on Amazon.I originally intended to post a review a few weeks ago after I had viewed it on cable, but for some reason I decided to read the negative views first(both book and movie) to see why or how anyone could condemn either. It became a laugh or cry situation. I opted for forced laughter.A few examples of the absurd negative comments follow (with my own comments in parenthesis):""Every copy of this book should be burned and never allowed to be read again."" (Ah, the sweet smell of scorched paper around the bonfires. Armbands optional?)""Yuk! Try to avoid reading this book as much as possible. . . . [I]t is confusing . . . and there is too much information given at one time."" (You had me at ""Yuk!"")""Thanks to all my friendswho had to tourchure threw reading this disgrace and supporting me in not likeing the book. By the way, DO NOT BUY, because if i find it in your house i won't think to kindly of you."" (I tremble in terror and weep in shame at what you would think of my bookshelves.)""Talk about a bad movie i would only buy it if someone paid me twice it's value to."" (I don't think this is what was meant by the ""new math."")And, my favorite: ""Do not watch, do not read ... stay ignorant of Harper Lee."" (I suspect, young reader, that you have succeeded far beyond Harper Lee.)Sorry to review the reviews, but now I actually have something serious to say about the movie and book.Years before the publication of Harper Lee's novel, there was a trial in a small southern Mississippi town in 1945. A black man named Willie McGee was accused of the rape of a white woman. The circumstantial evidence pointed strongly to the possibility that the relationship was forced by the woman. Just as in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" such a relationship at the time could not - would not - be tolerated. The case attracted national attention at the time, and after a prolonged series of appeals (spearheaded by former New York Congresswoman, Bella Abzug), a public execution was staged, which was no more than a legally sanctioned lynching. The state's portable electric chair was installed in the courthouse, which was filled to standing room only. Outside spectators climbed trees to gain a look at the execution through the opened windows. (A white Mississippi attorney, Dixon Pyles, also took part in the defense, so Atticus Finch is not without a foundation in fact.)The Scottsboro trials have been cited as the main inspiration for Lee's novel, but I've often wondered if the McGee trial might not also have played a role. But it really doesn't matter. Fiction is often more suited to tell the truth than history. And the truth is that although many people in the South knew Jim Crow laws and lynchings were wrong, they also knew that if you were vocal about it, you could lose your job - or your life, which is what makes the portrait of Atticus Finch a true profile in courage, a Southern Gothic version of Sir Thomas Moore in ""A Man For All Seasons.""But beyond the racial themes, both the book and the movie weave a gentle tapestry of what life in the South was like before air-conditioning, where games were things to be played outdoors rather than in front of computers, a discarded tire was an endlessly renewable resource for entertainment and summers seemed to last forever.  (I've lived what I'm talking about.)What saddens me about the negative reviews such as I quoted above is not their ignorance, but the lack of curiosity they display about our nation's history. I do, however, hope that the young reviewer who urged the burning of all copies of the book is oblivious of the historical events he or she evoked and will someday realize the horror of what such comments endorse.Ten stars if I could.",5,Ban both book and movie from all schools,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,3852,"['Why', 'ban', 'Then', 'might', 'be', 'spared', 'what', 'possibly', 'most', 'infantile', 'ignorant', 'uninformed', 'collection', 'negative', 'reviews', 'present', 'Amazon.I', 'originally', 'intended', 'post', 'review', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'had', 'viewed', 'cable', 'reason', 'decided', 'read', 'negative', 'views', 'first', 'book', 'movie', 'see', 'why', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'condemn', 'either', 'became', 'laugh', 'cry', 'situation', 'opted', 'forced', 'laughter.A', 'few', 'examples', 'absurd', 'negative', 'comments', 'follow', 'own', 'comments', 'parenthesis', 'copy', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'burned', 'never', 'allowed', 'be', 'read', 'again', 'Ah', 'sweet', 'smell', 'scorched', 'paper', 'bonfires', 'Armbands', 'optional', 'Yuk', 'Try', 'avoid', 'reading', 'book', 'as', 'much', 'possible', '[', ']', 'confusing', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'given', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'Yuk', 'Thanks', 'friendswho', 'had', 'tourchure', 'threw', 'reading', 'disgrace', 'supporting', 'not', 'likeing', 'book', 'way', 'DO', 'NOT', 'BUY', 'i', 'find', 'house', 'i', 'wo', ""n't"", 'think', 'kindly', 'tremble', 'terror', 'weep', 'shame', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'bookshelves', 'Talk', 'bad', 'movie', 'i', 'would', 'only', 'buy', 'someone', 'paid', 'twice', 'value', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'meant', 'new', 'math', 'favorite', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'stay', 'ignorant', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'suspect', 'young', 'reader', 'have', 'succeeded', 'far', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'Sorry', 'review', 'reviews', 'now', 'actually', 'have', 'something', 'serious', 'say', 'movie', 'book.Years', 'publication', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'novel', 'was', 'trial', 'small', 'southern', 'Mississippi', 'town', '1945', 'black', 'man', 'named', 'Willie', 'McGee', 'was', 'accused', 'rape', 'white', 'woman', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'pointed', 'strongly', 'possibility', 'relationship', 'was', 'forced', 'woman', 'Just', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'relationship', 'time', 'could', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'tolerated', 'case', 'attracted', 'national', 'attention', 'time', 'prolonged', 'series', 'appeals', 'spearheaded', 'former', 'New', 'York', 'Congresswoman', 'Bella', 'Abzug', 'public', 'execution', 'was', 'staged', 'was', 'more', 'legally', 'sanctioned', 'lynching', 'state', 'portable', 'electric', 'chair', 'was', 'installed', 'courthouse', 'was', 'filled', 'standing', 'room', 'only', 'spectators', 'climbed', 'trees', 'gain', 'look', 'execution', 'opened', 'windows', 'white', 'Mississippi', 'attorney', 'Dixon', 'Pyles', 'also', 'took', 'part', 'defense', 'so', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'not', 'foundation', 'fact', 'Scottsboro', 'trials', 'have', 'been', 'cited', 'main', 'inspiration', 'Lee', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'often', 'wondered', 'McGee', 'trial', 'might', 'not', 'also', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Fiction', 'often', 'more', 'suited', 'tell', 'truth', 'history', 'truth', 'many', 'people', 'South', 'knew', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'laws', 'lynchings', 'were', 'wrong', 'also', 'knew', 'were', 'vocal', 'could', 'lose', 'job', 'life', 'what', 'portrait', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'true', 'profile', 'courage', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'version', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Moore', 'A', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'racial', 'themes', 'book', 'movie', 'weave', 'gentle', 'tapestry', 'what', 'life', 'South', 'was', 'air-conditioning', 'where', 'games', 'were', 'things', 'be', 'played', 'outdoors', 'rather', 'front', 'computers', 'discarded', 'tire', 'was', 'endlessly', 'renewable', 'resource', 'entertainment', 'summers', 'seemed', 'last', 'forever', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'What', 'negative', 'reviews', 'such', 'quoted', 'above', 'not', 'ignorance', 'lack', 'curiosity', 'display', 'nation', 'history', 'do', 'however', 'hope', 'young', 'reviewer', 'who', 'urged', 'burning', 'copies', 'book', 'oblivious', 'historical', 'events', 'evoked', 'will', 'someday', 'realize', 'horror', 'what', 'such', 'comments', 'endorse.Ten', 'stars', 'could']",N/A

To be fair, we should take a glimpse around several essential films in the recent past which depicted with notable crudeness this sensible theme; among the most important we should name Defiant ones and The edge of city in the Fifties.But undoubtedly, the four most important thematic cycles  had reached its task in the movie industry: The Noir Film, The Science Fiction, The War memories and the lightweight comedies (Wilder, Hawks); an important and relatively recent current had born in the world: The French New Wave and the strong transcendence of the Italian Neo Realism permeated the vision of most of screen writers obligating them to make a true inward gaze in the deepest regions of the American social body. If there would be another weight reason to confirm this statement, examine carefully the work of Alfred Hitchcock from ""To catch a thief"" until ""Marnie"". You may realize how every one of the included pictures included these two concern about a dislocated state of mind, and the suspense is generated in the hidden caverns of the unconscious.In this sense this film had to shock the conscience of many viewers at that moment, when a small town layer assumes the hazardous task to defend a black man accused of rape. The allusive metaphors to nocturnal and spectral visions are eloquent testimonies of the tenseness at the verge of the boiling point.The bitter taste you experience even several elapsed weeks and months don 't leave any shadow of doubt about the grandness of this bold film that inspired future films in that decade, such as Patch of Blue, To Sir with love, Guess who is coming to dinner, In the heat of the night (it' s not a mere casualty all of them starred by Poitier) and nourished the inspired of another independent filmmakers such as Samuel Fuller with two somber and terrible films (Shock corridor and The naked kiss).

Great cast lead by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch who won the oscar for best actor. I have lost count how mant times I have seen this movie but it is for sure the one movie I have seen the most. I was about 10 maybe when I first saw it. As a kid I was fasinated by thr three kids in the movie (Jem,Scout and Dill) who in turn was always fascinated in trying to get a look at Boo Radley, the towns notorious crazy man. As I grew older and became more aware of the civil rights movement and racial prejudice the part of the movie involving Tom Robinson, a black man accused of beating and raping a white girl, became of main interest to me. Atticus does a wonderful job of showing Tom could not have committed what he is accused of. He does this all the while knowing that the jury will find his client guilty because of the color of his clients skin. My favorite scene in the movie is when Gregory Peck gives the closing argument to the jury. A great speech which I feel shows Gregory Peck at his absolute best as an actor. There are many other outstanding scenes in the movie. Too many to mention. You just got to take the time to watch this if the chance ever arrives.

There are, of course, the requisite bios and production notes, but the running commentary and feature-length documentary are what make this worth spending the money.The commentary is by director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula, and offers many insights into making the film. There are a couple of drawbacks to this commentary, one of which is Pakula talks very softly at times, making him difficult to understand. Another minor drawback is that when not offering great information, Pakula and Mulligan are often complimenting each other and all involved on what a great job they did on the film. This is not really a bad thing, as it's almost as if they can't believe that it came out as well as it did.The documentary, &quot;Fearful Symmetry,&quot; appears to be made especially for this DVD.

50632,A8F2AZWB20X1H,0783222955,JLind555,"[105, 122]","Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan and Horton Foote have made an absolutely terrific movie of one of the greatest books in contemporary fiction.  The three years covered in the book are compressed into one year in the movie,  and almost everything of importance is kept in the film version.Shooting the movie in black and white was inspired.  It symbolizes the stark reality of black vs. white that is at the core of the novel. The acting is extraordinary across the board.  Of Gregory Peck, so much has been said that further praise is redundant; suffice to say that after Peck's performance, no one else will ever be able to play Atticus Finch.  The children are wonderful, so real that they hardly seem to be acting at all.  Mary Badham is absolutely perfect as Scout.  Phillip Alford is excellent as Jem, and John Megna is fine as Dill.  The lesser actors live up to the lead roles.  I especially liked Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell; James Anderson brings out all the ugliness and cowardice in Bob Ewell, and Alice Ghostley is a funny and wacky Stephanie Crawford.The three characters who didn't live up to their counterparts in the book were Miss Maudie, Calpurnia, and Tom Robinson.  Ms. Maudie is a very intriguing character in the novel, a ditzy, wise, funny woman of bedrock integrity; in the movie, she comes across as just another next door neighbor.  Calpurnia's part was far too small in the movie; in the book she plays a major role in the family, almost like a surrogate parent.  Estelle Evans is a fine actress and deserved a bigger role to give her talent more scope.  And Tom Robinson is almost too saintly to be believed in the film version, over-acted by Brock Peters.  But Robert Duvall in a non-speaking movie debut is just right as Boo Radley, and Scout's recognition of her formerly scary neighbor, with her tentative smile followed by 'Hey Boo', is one of the most affecting moments in the picture.I still remember when Peck won the Oscar for best actor; in his acceptance speech, his first words were 'Thank you, Harper  Lee.'

Badham was nominated for an Academy Award, and I feel that it is on the strength of Scout that this movie was carried.  While Peck may have been the moral backbone of the movie, it is Badham that is the heart of the movie and whom the film truly does revolve around.To Kill a Mockingbird is the film adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same title.  The story deals with racism and morality in a very humanistic way.  When a black man is accused of raping a white woman, Atticus Finch takes the case to defend Tom Robinson (the man accused).  This is a story about race relations as well as community relations and in the end, about doing the right thing.  The house next to the Finch home is the Radley house.  There are stories and rumors and prejudices against the hidden Radley boy, Boo Radley (the screen debut of Robert Duvall).  Somehow, the stories about the Radley home come together with the trial of Tom Robinson and the moment where Scout gently says, ""hey Boo"" is truly a beautiful moment.I could probably heap praise on this movie until my fingers can't type anymore, but I am simply going to end by saying this is a movie than anybody who wants to watch a great movie needs to see this.

His chief complaint is how the film spends twenty to twenty-five minutes on a character which we never see again and how everything is wrapped up so neatly by another character, the psychologist, who appears only in the last two or three minutes! Well. if the screenplay of PSYCHO has a bad structure--TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD takes the cake! I haven't read the prize-winning Harper Lee semiautobiographical novel, but if my nephew had written a similarly-structured script for his Walter screenwriting class at UCLA, it would have been thrown out!First of all, the film is divided in two parts. Sorry, but this is a film--not a two act play. The first half concentrates on Scout and really builds up her character. The second half is sedentary court-room drama. So, Mr. Foote, Ms Lee, WHO'S STORY IS IT???Boo Radley's father is a peripheral character and could have easily been omitted. If I recall, and I just watched the film the other day after over twenty-five years, he doesn't even have a line of dialogue!Worse still, and equal to the first point I mention above, is the visual introduction of the Boo charcter after two hours of light on a screen! It's almost like a thankless role, and yet he is the symbolic ""mockingbird"" of the tale. He's not just Simon Oakland wrapping things up and making all ends meet as he does in the final minutes of PSYCHO.Don't get me wrong, it is a most well intentioned film and well-timed as far as the socio-political events unfolding in the country at the time, but in addition to Foote's poor structure, Robert Mulligan was just the wrong director for this heavy theme.I saw it on VHS and I can't remember if it was the late producer Alan Pakula or not, who says in a short interview segment following the film, that no film had ever been made at that time which was from a child's POV. Err, excuse me, Mr. Pakula, ever heard of Rene' Clement's JEUX INTERDITS (Forbidden Games, 1952)? Also, the original trailer is shown at the beginning before the movie.

It won three academy awards and was quite daring and innovative for 1962 to talk about rape by a black man of a white teenager. The story takes place in a small Southern town in 1935, and highlights the relationships of children with the town, and the events are seen through their eyes, and of course, the white town's view of the black people. The young girl tomboy Scout (the narrator)is a hoot, but probably will have real behavior problems in adulthood.  The other children are her brother Jem and the neighbor boy Dill. The plot has been repeated in the South many times, black man falsely accused and covicted, and then eventually killed while ""trying to escape."" The real white suspect in this story is later killed when the mentally handicapped neighbor stops him from harming the children.

50647,A3SV72ZAHH2IDH,0783222955,"Josephll ""Reformed Music Addict""","[5, 5]","Robert Mulligan's film version of Harper Lee's classic is nothing short of excellent. It portraits a book in the best possible way. The story is about siblings Scout and Jem growing up in a small quiet southern town in the 30's with their father, a lawyer and widower called Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck). Little is happening in the town and the kids spend alot of their time outside playing and stalking on a neighbour ""Boo"" Radley who is considered mentally disturbed and dangerous. Most of the film is told in the eyes of the little girl Scout (It could just aswell have been the author herself talking of her childhood). At early stage their father will teach them to not have prejudices and to show both humanity, acceptance and not judge people from the outside. In one particular scene when a young boy was invited to their home for dinner he will use as much syryp as possible for his food and Scout ridiculate him for doing that, when her father intervenes and tells her not to judge the boy for that his behavior.When a black man called Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) is getting accused for rape of a white woman, Finch takes the tough responsabilty to defend him. He puts himself in a dangerous situation when most people of the town have already decided he's guilty before proven innocent an just want to hang him. Finch will not only get threaten by the young woman's father but he will also protect Tom from his jail cell when a mob arrives to fight and he'll do his best in proving what shortly get's obvious; That Tom Robinson is innocent. Peck proves why he's one of our finest actors in a very memorable court scene where he gives a long speach, summing up the case and proving why Tom was judged by the colour of his skin rather then for the proof that was brought into the court in his favour. Other then Peck, I would also like to give credit for Peters great performence in the courtroom where he tells his story in the most honest and emotional ways possible and ofcourse to the briliant child performences from Jem and Scout, the credability of their roles give the film extra tension and throughout the film it's very exciting to follow what is going to happen next since there are many pieces to put together.This is not only a classic film portaiting a small society with racism in the 30's but also about doing what is right and to have courage to do so even if it sometimes hard opposition and your chances are very slim. It's also about morality and to not judge people from the outside (There is a quite un-expected ending that will teach the kids a valuable lesson also). ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a true classic and one of those films that you should have seen. It may be over 40 years old and in black and white but that doesn't take away either it's beauty or magnificient portrayal.

No character in film history has more deserved to be designated as the best 'good guy'. Peck garnered a well-deserved Oscar for his role as a man of understated wisdom and quiet courage and the quintessential father-figure all men should aspire to be and all children long for in their lives.  The fact that this film, it's participants, and the basic story are still being honored after 40+ years is a testament to the solid message if offered and the effective manner in which it was presented.I read this Pulitzer Prize novel when it was published and saw the film upon its theatrical release.  The memory of both have long lingered.  Enough can't be said about the wisdom of Universal's decision to release this Collector's Edition DVD. The public owes them a monumental 'thank-you'. Interviews with Gregory Peck and commentary by director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula make us privy to their precious memories surrounding how the charming novel was transformed into the perfect film.  Seeing Mary Badham (Scout) and Philip Alford (Jem) (non-professional southern children starring in an Oscar-nominated film) as adults offering insights into their unique experiences was an unbelievable treat.  To watch Robert Duvall make his screen debut as 'Boo Radley', and what a debut that was; and to hear his comments nearly a half-century later proves as never before the value of the DVD format and special features.Watching this film upon its release it was inconceivable that we could one day far in the future hear and see the inside story of its making in the comfort of our homes and from the mouths of the individuals so instrumental in the process of creating a legend.This DVD is priceless. The details of the making of this time-honored film have now been documented forever in a piece of movie-history that deserves to be savored by any true movie-buff as well as by a generation not yet born at the time of it's release.

It is told from the eyes of a young girl named ""Scout"", the 6 year old daughter of a county lawyer, Atticus Finch.  Mary Badham marvelously plays ""Scout"", a Tom-boy, who with her brother ""Jem"", and friend ""Dill"" witness the events that swept them into the eye of the hurricane of racial hatred.  While the three children are consumed by the rumors about their mysterious neighbor, ""Boo"" Radley, Scout's father, Atticus Finch, prepares to defend the black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white girl.  Gregory Peck is absolutley fabulous as Atticus Finch.  Peck nails the character of Atticus the lawyer who defends the wrongfully accused black man of raping a white woman in the deep racial South in 1935. The outcome of the trial was a given, guilty; yet, Atticus courageously stands up to the prejudicial all-white jury and angrilly demands them to find the courage to stand up for the truth and set free an innocent man.  Yet, the social rules of the time demanded a guilty verdict and it was brought.  Robinson despairs and breaks away during a transfer and is shot and killed.  All seems lost, and Atticus and his children despair.  But the end is not yet. Bob Euell, the father of the girl who claimed rape has a hatred of Atticus that cannot be quenched even by the death of Robinson.  He blindly hates Atticus for daring to take the opinion of a black man over a white man.  Since he does not have the courage to face Atticus, he instead goes after Scout and Jem.  Suddenly and unexpectedly, the children are rescued by their mysterious reclusive neighbor Arthur ""Boo"" Radley, who was the children's protector, despite his mental retardation.The movie ends in a touching scene where Scout slowly walks Boo back to his house holding his pale hand in hers.  She then returns to the secure and comforting lap of her father Atticus, who is dutifully watching over injured Jem.  In the background is a picture of Atticus' deceased wife on the mantle, (the first view we have of her).  The love of this father for his children is clearly evident in his tenderness and decency.Oh how this world could so richly benefit from more honorable and courageous men like Atticus Finch.Buy this movie and watch it once a year with your children.  As your children age, they will see the deeper social message which is the heart of the movie.Jim Koenig",5,Gregory Peck's Greatest Movie,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,2470,"['turly', 'classic', 'film', 'been', 'universally', 'recognized', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'told', 'eyes', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Scout', '6', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'county', 'lawyer', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'marvelously', 'Scout', 'Tom-boy', 'who', 'brother', 'Jem', 'friend', 'Dill', 'events', 'swept', 'eye', 'hurricane', 'racial', 'hatred', 'three', 'children', 'are', 'consumed', 'rumors', 'mysterious', 'neighbor', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'Scout', 'father', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'defend', 'black', 'man', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'who', 'been', 'accused', 'raping', 'white', 'girl', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'absolutley', 'fabulous', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Peck', 'character', 'Atticus', 'lawyer', 'who', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'black', 'man', 'raping', 'white', 'woman', 'deep', 'racial', 'South', '1935', 'outcome', 'trial', 'was', 'given', 'guilty', 'yet', 'Atticus', 'courageously', 'up', 'prejudicial', 'all-white', 'jury', 'angrilly', 'find', 'courage', 'stand', 'up', 'truth', 'set', 'free', 'innocent', 'man', 'social', 'rules', 'time', 'demanded', 'guilty', 'verdict', 'was', 'brought', 'Robinson', 'despairs', 'breaks', 'away', 'transfer', 'shot', 'killed', 'lost', 'Atticus', 'children', 'despair', 'end', 'not', 'yet', 'Bob', 'Euell', 'father', 'girl', 'who', 'claimed', 'rape', 'hatred', 'Atticus', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'quenched', 'even', 'death', 'Robinson', 'blindly', 'Atticus', 'daring', 'take', 'opinion', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'man', 'not', 'have', 'courage', 'face', 'Atticus', 'instead', 'Scout', 'Jem', 'Suddenly', 'unexpectedly', 'children', 'are', 'rescued', 'mysterious', 'reclusive', 'neighbor', 'Arthur', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'who', 'was', 'children', 'protector', 'mental', 'retardation.The', 'movie', 'touching', 'scene', 'where', 'Scout', 'slowly', 'Boo', 'back', 'house', 'holding', 'pale', 'hand', 'hers', 'then', 'secure', 'comforting', 'lap', 'father', 'Atticus', 'who', 'dutifully', 'watching', 'over', 'injured', 'Jem', 'background', 'picture', 'Atticus', 'deceased', 'wife', 'mantle', 'first', 'view', 'have', 'love', 'father', 'children', 'clearly', 'evident', 'tenderness', 'decency.Oh', 'how', 'world', 'could', 'so', 'richly', 'benefit', 'more', 'honorable', 'courageous', 'men', 'Atticus', 'Finch.Buy', 'movie', 'watch', 'once', 'year', 'children', 'children', 'age', 'will', 'see', 'deeper', 'social', 'message', 'heart', 'movie.Jim', 'Koenig']",N/A

50672,A3K8O01S0XGWHT,0783222955,"Larry Bridges ""thebachelor""","[2, 3]","It says a lot that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was made in 1962, at a time when Hollywood was finally able to address the civil rights issue and congratulate itself on its courage for doing so, while not actually presenting material that would be truly challenging to American audiences.  If a film like this had been made even ten years earlier, it would have constituted an act of true artistic courage.  Made in 1962, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a work of great artistry, but there is nothing overwhelmingly courageous about it.Critical response to the film version of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" seems to fall into two categories.  The majority of reviewers have praised the film's beauty and simplicity, its wonderfully natural and understated performances, and its loving evocation of a long-gone place and time.  A minority of commentators, including Roger Ebert, have criticized the film's lapses of believability and its use of African-American characters as symbols rather than individuals.I think that both views are clearly correct.  The performances of the entire cast -- in particular, Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Brock Peters -- bring the story to life so naturally that the viewer seems to be watching the lives of real people rather than a movie.  As Mulligan and Pakula point out on their DVD commentary, the entire film is handled with a dignity and restraint that would be unthinkable in later eras of the history of motion pictures.On the other hand, the film features less meaningful interaction between the black and white characters than one might have hoped -- less, indeed, than takes place in Harper Lee's novel.  Tom Robinson, the African-American character most central to the plot, never comes into direct contact with Scout, the viewpoint character.  She witnesses his tragedy like a spectator at a play, never seeming to grapple with it personally.  When the repercussions of Tom Robinson's story finally threaten Scout and Jem in the film's third act, it is a white character who endangers them and another white character who saves them.The only African-American character who walks through the movie as a regular person rather than a tragic symbol is Calpurnia, Atticus' household employee, excellently played by Estelle Evans.  In earlier Hollywood eras, few black characters could have interacted with whites so naturally and straightforwardly, or been presented as strong and intelligent individuals in their own right without any trace of comedy.  But even Calpurnia seems to fade out of the story as it proceeds, and we never see her reaction to the fate of Tom Robinson.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a treasurable movie, in particular for its depiction of the unusual relationship of mutual respect between Atticus and his children and for Elmer Bernstein's score, featuring one of the loveliest main themes ever to come out of Hollywood.  But it probably does not deserve to be regarded as one of America's greatest films.  Most mockingbirds are gray, but there are two mockingbirds in this movie:  one white and one black.  Only the white mockingbird perches on the heroine's shoulder to sing his song, and that's a bit disappointing.",4,"""And little things in between""",1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,3167,"['lot', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'was', 'made', '1962', 'time', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'address', 'civil', 'rights', 'issue', 'congratulate', 'courage', 'doing', 'so', 'not', 'actually', 'presenting', 'material', 'would', 'be', 'truly', 'challenging', 'American', 'audiences', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'even', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'would', 'have', 'constituted', 'act', 'true', 'artistic', 'courage', 'Made', '1962', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'work', 'great', 'artistry', 'nothing', 'overwhelmingly', 'courageous', 'it.Critical', 'response', 'film', 'version', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'fall', 'two', 'categories', 'majority', 'reviewers', 'have', 'praised', 'film', 'beauty', 'simplicity', 'wonderfully', 'natural', 'understated', 'performances', 'loving', 'evocation', 'long-gone', 'place', 'time', 'minority', 'commentators', 'including', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'lapses', 'believability', 'use', 'African-American', 'characters', 'symbols', 'rather', 'individuals.I', 'think', 'views', 'are', 'clearly', 'correct', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'particular', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'Brock', 'Peters', 'bring', 'story', 'life', 'so', 'naturally', 'viewer', 'be', 'watching', 'lives', 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'movie', 'Mulligan', 'Pakula', 'point', 'out', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'entire', 'film', 'handled', 'dignity', 'restraint', 'would', 'be', 'unthinkable', 'later', 'eras', 'history', 'motion', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'less', 'meaningful', 'interaction', 'black', 'white', 'characters', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'hoped', 'less', 'indeed', 'place', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'novel', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'African-American', 'character', 'most', 'central', 'plot', 'never', 'direct', 'contact', 'Scout', 'viewpoint', 'character', 'tragedy', 'spectator', 'play', 'never', 'seeming', 'grapple', 'personally', 'When', 'repercussions', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'story', 'finally', 'threaten', 'Scout', 'Jem', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'white', 'character', 'who', 'white', 'character', 'who', 'them.The', 'only', 'African-American', 'character', 'who', 'movie', 'regular', 'person', 'rather', 'tragic', 'symbol', 'Calpurnia', 'Atticus', 'household', 'employee', 'excellently', 'played', 'Estelle', 'Evans', 'earlier', 'Hollywood', 'eras', 'few', 'black', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'interacted', 'whites', 'so', 'naturally', 'straightforwardly', 'been', 'presented', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'individuals', 'own', 'right', 'trace', 'comedy', 'even', 'Calpurnia', 'fade', 'story', 'never', 'see', 'reaction', 'fate', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'treasurable', 'movie', 'particular', 'depiction', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'mutual', 'respect', 'Atticus', 'children', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'score', 'featuring', 'one', 'loveliest', 'main', 'themes', 'ever', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'probably', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'films', 'Most', 'mockingbirds', 'are', 'gray', 'are', 'two', 'mockingbirds', 'movie', 'one', 'white', 'one', 'black', 'Only', 'white', 'mockingbird', 'perches', 'heroine', 'shoulder', 'sing', 'song', 'bit', 'disappointing']",N/A

They are obsessed with catching a glimpse of Boo Radley, about whom much has been whispered amongst the neighbors.  Like many rumors, there is much more to the story, which will become apparent toward the end of the movie.The stark black and white images perfectly depicted the settings and the deprivation of this small town world.  Yet despite their lack of material trappings, the children found plenty to amuse themselves, utilizing their minds and their imaginations.The themes of the film are fear, racism, and integrity--and the latter trait was depicted most notably by Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch.The lessons in understanding and empathy came specifically from Atticus, as spoken to his children:  You never really know a person until you walk for awhile in his shoes.This filmTo Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)is still very relevant, despite the fact that some race relations have been improved.

50682,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,0783222955,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[1, 2]","Released in 1962, To Kill a Mockingbird ranks #34 on the AFI top 100 movie list and shows clearly just how powerful a classic movie can be. Where many movies fade and wither in time, To Kill a Mockingbird remains just as powerful, just as memorable as when it was first filmed. In other movies the characters can feel dated. The acting can seem shoddy. People make excuses about ""well, it was only the 1960s. What can you expect."" THIS is what you can expect. The dialogue is stellar. The acting is superb. Even in black and white, even with the limited technology available, you get sucked in, immersed, and feel the full reality of what is going on. This is what high quality movie making is all about.The movie is a perfect window into events which were all too familiar during the Great Depression. People struggled to get by. They had to try to pay their bills with crops grown in their back yard. People with mental illness were treated little better than dogs. Women were beaten. Into all of this comes young Scout, a girl growing up with her older brother and widowed father. She is a tomboy, eager to speak out and fight for her cause. The worst thing her brother can accuse her of is acting like a ""girl"". She has strong ideals and is not afraid to voice them.Her father, a lawyer, is tapped to represent a local black man who has been accused of raping a white woman. Most of the town wants to lynch the poor accused man, although some townsfolk see the injustice of it. Scout leaps into fights with her schoolmates to defend the honor of her father. And ironically, when her father is threatened, it is her willingness to speak up and say what she feels that helps to soothe the situation.I can't say enough good things about this film. Gregory Peck is incredible. He gives just the right touch to so many scenes. You can see in his eyes the mix of emotions as he stands strong on the steps before the mob. When his son is hurt, and he's standing outside the window trying desperately to figure out what to do, my heart ached for him. His strength in the courtroom, and his tenderness with his kids is just stunning.I have seen this movie many times, and I look forward to seeing it many more. Every time someone tries to make a case for a shoddy movie from the 60s or 50s, claiming ""well it's just how movies were made back then"", I point to this one. THIS is how fine movies were made in this time period. This shows great acting, great dialogue, and a mix of characters who are authentic and interesting and respectful of their origins. The mentally ill man is not treated as a joke. He is a real human being. The drunkard father, the lying daughter, and the plight of the black members of the community are all shown with clarity and realism.It is a minor, interesting note, that despite the movie seeming to revolve around women, they never talk with each other! It's all about how men impact their lives. Scout is central but she is primarily talked to by her father and brother. Those are the influences she cares about. Only briefly does the nanny character talk with her. Similarly, the lying daughter is another key character but she is only ever talked to / at by the lawyer and her father. The movie is about how the women are handled / guided by men. I think the only time a female really talks to any of these women is when the nanny scolds Scout for how she behaves to a guest. That's the one instance in the entire film.Highly recommended in the strongest possible words.

I do not feel it necessary to review this classic film. Unless the subject matter is not suitable for one's age, everyone in the free world has surely seen the film entitled, To Kill a Mockingbird, or at the very least read the book. If not, shame on your High School English teacher! To Kill a Mockingbird was required reading when I was in High School & I could not put the book down until I had turned the very last page! To say that it is a page turner is not only redundant, it is also an understatement. However, this review is about the Blu-Ray not the book. Needless to say, I was absolutely thrilled to learn that To Kill a Mockingbird was showing in my home town movie theater. Having read the book, my sister & I absolutely could not wait to see the film. We no sooner returned home from the movie theater when we agreed to change the names of our two Finches (tiny caged birds). Mine was renamed Atticus Finch & my sister chose the name Scout Finch. Thus, I have read the book which remains on my bookshelf to this very day, purchased a ticket to watch To Kill a Mockingbird when it was initially released in movie theaters & I own the film version on both VHS & DVD. Yet I could not manage to resist purchasing this 50TH Anniversary Edition on Blu-Ray, DVD & Digital Copy for the incredibly reasonable price offered by Amazon. The Remastered Blu-Ray quality is truly excellent. Thankfully it remains in Black & White. There are many Bonus Features. So many in fact that I have no doubt it could take  several weeks to view all. The interviews with the actors are extremely interesting & entertaining. A true fan of the film To Kill a Mockingbird cannot go wrong with this set. It comes with two discs, one DVD, the other Blu-Ray, along with instructions about how to download the Digital Copy from your PC. The Blu-Ray is in 1080p High Definition Widescreen 1.85:1 which is apparent as once again, the picture quality is just incredible. The DVD is Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1. Both are in English & French but surprisingly not Spanish & both have English, Spanish & French subtitles.

50695,A1D90MKRWB0ZKP,0783222955,March boy,"[1, 3]","Academy award nominations: Picture, Director-Robert Mulligan, Supporting Actress-Mary Badham, Black and White cinematography, Original Score-Elmer Bernstein.Wins: Leading Actor-Gregory Peck, Screenplay Based on another Medium and Black and White Set Design.March Boy awards: Supporting Actor-James Anderson, Screenplay Based on Another Medium and Black and White cinematography.To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those movies where if you say an ill word about it people will gasp and say things like &#8220;Oh my goodness! You have no taste! That&#8217;s like criticizing the Mona Lisa or the Sistine Chapel! Go back to your CGI transformer flicks!&#8221; It is rated 94% on Rotten Tomatoes and there is not a single negative review on the critic page of the Internet Movie Database. For that reason I think it is a little overrated.It is beautifully shot and has a good score but a movie needs more than great photography and music. It needs great screenwriting (which is frankly excellent especially in the courtroom) but it also needs great acting and direction and that is what To Kill a Mockingbird lacks a lot of.Gregory Peck is a star I just can&#8217;t seem to warm up to. He was handsome and had a great speaking voice but I&#8217;ve never felt like he became the character. I&#8217;ve seen Gentleman&#8217;s Agreement, The Yearling and Roman Holiday and all these performances have a sameness to them. The same can be said about Atticus Finch. Peck is fairly good in the quieter scenes like when he&#8217;s talking to Scout and Jem but whenever a scene becomes tense or dramatic he never seems to loosen up. He has a habit of going into these self-conscious frowns and smiles and sometimes says his lines like he was sight reading the newspaper. Even his &#8220;In the name of God believe Tom Robinson&#8221; is as calm, cool and collected as if a rape case were the most ordinary thing of the day.The child actors got on my nerves too. They aren&#8217;t exactly bad but their whole demeanor struck me as a little too cute country bumpkin. John Megna as Dill is especially annoying; that whinny voice of his could peel paint.On the other hand, many of the supporting players are superb. Alice Ghostly and Ruth White are excellent as the cantankerous neighbors Stephanie Crawford and Mrs. Dubose. Brock Peters is great in his one little scene as Tom Robinson, (especially his line delivery of &#8220;I did not sir!&#8221;) Collin Wilcox Paxton (Mayella) plays eccentric and nervous like no other and James Anderson&#8217;s snarling, vicious Mr. Ewell should have received an Oscar nomination.Robert Mulligan&#8217;s direction ranges from average to not very good. For instance, there are plenty of moments where he could have shown close ups of the characters faces but instead shows their back from a distance. When Jem, Scout and Dill are all clustered at the courtroom door trying to get a view, they make a tower and stand Dill on the top. As he look in he says &#8220;There&#8217;s a colored man standing next to your daddy. There&#8217;s another man shouting at them.&#8221; But we only see the back of his head. Why couldn&#8217;t we see his reaction to the courtroom proceedings? Also after the trial, when Atticus comes home with the news Tom is dead he slumps against a rail and says &#8220;We had such a great chance. We had MORE than a chance.&#8221; Once again we see the back of his head instead of an effective close up of his face to see his expression&#8212;how he&#8217;s desperately struggling to keep all his inner tensions bottled up. However, I think the scene where the kids are sneaking into Mr. Radley&#8217;s yard was appropriately suspenseful (especially with Boo&#8217;s shadow) and the courtroom scene was good too.Make no mistake. To Kill a Mockingbird has a great story to work with&#8212;the father/son/daughter relationship is quite beautiful and Atticus is a parent everyone should strive to emulate. He knew in his heart he wasn&#8217;t going to win this case since he was defending a black man against a white jury in the South but he still stood up for what he sincerely believed was the truth. A movie with a storyline as great as To Kill a Mockingbird deserves to have devoted fans so if you love it, be fanatical by all means. I enjoyed it; I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as spectacularly done (technical-wise) as so many people give it credit. I wouldn&#8217;t call it an example of terrific filmmaking but I do think it&#8217;s worth watching nonetheless.",3,To Kill a Mockingbird is a little overrated but still good.,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,4509,"['Academy', 'award', 'nominations', 'Picture', 'Director-Robert', 'Mulligan', 'Supporting', 'Actress-Mary', 'Badham', 'Black', 'White', 'cinematography', 'Original', 'Score-Elmer', 'Bernstein.Wins', 'Leading', 'Actor-Gregory', 'Peck', 'Screenplay', 'Based', 'Medium', 'Black', 'White', 'Set', 'Design.March', 'Boy', 'awards', 'Supporting', 'Actor-James', 'Anderson', 'Screenplay', 'Based', 'Medium', 'Black', 'White', 'cinematography.To', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'say', 'ill', 'word', 'people', 'will', 'gasp', 'say', 'things', '8220', 'Oh', 'goodness', 'have', 'taste', '8217', 'criticizing', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'Go', 'back', 'CGI', 'transformer', 'flicks', '8221', 'rated', '94', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'not', 'single', 'negative', 'review', 'critic', 'page', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'reason', 'think', 'little', 'overrated.It', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'good', 'score', 'movie', 'more', 'great', 'photography', 'music', 'great', 'screenwriting', 'frankly', 'excellent', 'especially', 'courtroom', 'also', 'great', 'acting', 'direction', 'what', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'lot', 'of.Gregory', 'Peck', 'star', 'just', 'can', '8217', 'seem', 'warm', 'up', 'was', 'handsome', 'had', 'great', 'speaking', 'voice', '8217', 'never', 'felt', 'became', 'character', '8217', 'seen', 'Gentleman', '8217', 'Agreement', 'Yearling', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'performances', 'have', 'sameness', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Peck', 'fairly', 'good', 'quieter', 'scenes', 'when', '8217', 'talking', 'Scout', 'Jem', 'whenever', 'scene', 'tense', 'dramatic', 'never', 'loosen', 'up', 'habit', 'going', 'self-conscious', 'frowns', 'smiles', 'sometimes', 'lines', 'was', 'sight', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'Even', '8220', 'name', 'God', 'believe', 'Tom', 'Robinson', '8221', 'calm', 'cool', 'collected', 'rape', 'case', 'were', 'most', 'ordinary', 'thing', 'day.The', 'child', 'actors', 'got', 'nerves', 'too', 'aren', '8217', 'exactly', 'bad', 'whole', 'demeanor', 'struck', 'little', 'too', 'cute', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'John', 'Megna', 'Dill', 'especially', 'annoying', 'whinny', 'voice', 'could', 'peel', 'other', 'hand', 'many', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'superb', 'Alice', 'Ghostly', 'Ruth', 'White', 'are', 'excellent', 'cantankerous', 'neighbors', 'Stephanie', 'Crawford', 'Mrs.', 'Dubose', 'Brock', 'Peters', 'great', 'one', 'little', 'scene', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'especially', 'line', 'delivery', '8220', 'did', 'not', 'sir', '8221', 'Collin', 'Wilcox', 'Paxton', 'Mayella', 'eccentric', 'nervous', 'other', 'James', 'Anderson', '8217', 'snarling', 'vicious', 'Mr.', 'Ewell', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination.Robert', 'Mulligan', '8217', 's', 'direction', 'average', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'instance', 'are', 'plenty', 'moments', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'close', 'ups', 'characters', 'instead', 'back', 'distance', 'When', 'Jem', 'Scout', 'Dill', 'are', 'clustered', 'courtroom', 'door', 'trying', 'get', 'view', 'make', 'tower', 'stand', 'Dill', 'top', '8220', '8217', 's', 'colored', 'man', 'standing', 'next', 'daddy', '8217', 'man', 'shouting', 'them.', '8221', 'only', 'see', 'back', 'head', 'Why', 'couldn', '8217', 'see', 'reaction', 'courtroom', 'proceedings', 'Also', 'trial', 'when', 'Atticus', 'home', 'news', 'Tom', 'dead', 'rail', '8220', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'chance', 'had', 'MORE', 'chance.', '8221', 'Once', 'again', 'see', 'back', 'head', 'instead', 'effective', 'close', 'face', 'see', 'expression', '8212', 'how', '8217', 'desperately', 'struggling', 'keep', 'inner', 'tensions', 'bottled', 'up', 'However', 'think', 'scene', 'where', 'kids', 'are', 'sneaking', 'Mr.', 'Radley', '8217', 'yard', 'was', 'appropriately', 'suspenseful', 'especially', 'Boo', '8217', 'shadow', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'was', 'good', 'too.Make', 'mistake', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'great', 'story', 'work', '8212', 'father/son/daughter', 'relationship', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'Atticus', 'parent', 'everyone', 'should', 'strive', 'emulate', 'knew', 'heart', 'wasn', '8217', 'going', 'win', 'case', 'was', 'defending', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'jury', 'South', 'still', 'stood', 'up', 'what', 'sincerely', 'believed', 'was', 'truth', 'movie', 'storyline', 'as', 'great', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'have', 'devoted', 'fans', 'so', 'love', 'be', 'fanatical', 'means', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'don', '8217', 'think', '8217', 'spectacularly', 'done', 'technical-wise', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'give', 'credit', 'wouldn', '8217', 'call', 'example', 'terrific', 'filmmaking', 'do', 'think', '8217', 'watching', 'nonetheless']",N/A

50697,A129YBX5BVNW2,0783222955,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[6, 6]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY VERSION ***In April 2012 Universal Studios is 100 years old - and to celebrate that movie centenary - they've had 13 of their most-celebrated films fully restored for BLU RAY. But it doesn't stop there. As many as 80 other titles will be given re-launches across the year as well - each featuring distinctive ""100th Anniversary"" card-wrap packaging and in many cases a host of new features. Most (not all) of these re-issues will be two-disc sets containing the Blu Ray, the DVD and also means to obtain a Digital Copy via download.1962's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the thirteen singled out for full restoration (see list below) - and an absolute peach it is too.Released 10 January 2012 - it comes in a gorgeous limited edition 'book pack' (Barcode 5050582881844). The outer hardback holder has a card-pouch wrapped around it at the base and a 45-page booklet contained within. The book has interviews with Veronique Peck (his wife of 40 plus years), Harper Lee (author of the 1960 novel), pictures of the Shooting Script, Original Storyboards, Original Posters and Lobby Cards (from around the world), Press Book Excerpts and even Correspondence surrounding the movie (telegrams of congratulations from Fred Astaire, Betty Bacall and Charlton Heston). It's a visual feast with loads of photos peppering the wonderful memorabilia. Universal are to be praised for this because it absolutely looks the part. But the real fireworks comes in the other two elements at play here - the extensive extras - and the glorious new print...Digitally remastered and Fully Restored from Original Film Elements - Universal are reputed to have stumped-up over $300,000 for the restoration - and the results are BEAUTIFUL. Even from the opening logo and credits of a child drawing - there are no lines or scratches of any kind - and the black and white cinematography of 1930's Alabama is fantastically clear. Stand-out clarity - the scene where the accused black man Tom Robertson is sweating in the courtroom as he relays his side of the story (a superlative Brock Peters - he read the Eulogy at Peck's funeral in 2003 at Peck's request), Atticus's son Jem is in his dad's car outside the family home of the black Robertson family as the hateful Bob Ewell looks on, the three children watching from the bushes as the mob try to take the jail with Atticus guarding the doorway, Atticus explaining what happened to Tom Robertson after the trial as the moonlight shines on his suit, the young girl Scout pointing out the simpleton Boo Radley behind the bedroom door (Robert Duvall's stunning cinematic debut where he doesn't utter a word but leaves an indelible mark) - it's all suddenly gorgeous. And the sound is rounded and clean too. An exemplary job.The extras are equally superb - the centrepiece of which is a near one and half-hour documentary called ""A Conversation With..."" It's a feast for Peck fans - interviews with Barry Norman in 1974, Terry Wogan in 1979 and other notables throughout the years are peppered with home movies and footage of Peck giving a one-on-one show to a Virginia audience in 1999. It's a raconteur tour-de-force a la David Niven - an 83-year old Peck is generous, charming, witty, responsive - full of anecdotes about Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Harper Lee. We get stories about meeting his wife in Paris just before shooting for ""Roman Holiday"" began - there's footage of dinner with the President of France Jacques Chirac and his family - a visit to Niagara Falls with his daughter Cecilia (handshakes with an adoring public) - US President Bill Clinton giving Peck the National Medal Of Arts and dropping it! But most of all as the minutes pass by you 'get' why Gregory Peck was greeted with such staggering affection everywhere he went in the world - he literally exuded 'good guy' from his every pore - that old style Hollywood class - a talented giant who didn't have a mean bone in his body. It's joyful stuff to watch.The movie itself has entered into folklore - released in 1962 and filmed in Black and White - it primarily centres on a black man accused of raping a white woman and the trial that follows. Such was the power of the story - and especially Peck's central performance as the principled lawyer Atticus Finch (his only Oscar win) it literally inspired members of the public to take up the law as a profession and even impacted on America's turbulent and changing racial landscape of the time. The performances by the children as innocents are particularly superb too - but it's Peck who dominates the whole thing with a gravitas and sincerity that few actors could match. His stand against bigotry is magnificent and filled with a quiet decency that has touched audiences for decades. As if sensing the importance of the part, Peck's scrawl is all over the shooting script - to the point that it often obliterates the text - the four words he scribbled on the last page describing the character he plays title this review - and describe the great man himself.To sum up - with the 1930 anti-war masterpiece ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" also being amongst the first vanguard of these 'restored' releases - it's heartening to see Universal Studios finally throw some proper money at the preservation of its movie legacy - and be proud about doing so too. I for one will collect the whole series - and live in hope that other studios respect their past in the same glorious way.An absolutely first-class release - and then some.BLU RAY Specifications:EXTRAS:1.

50700,AKX28FGA6L47J,0783222955,Mark,"[9, 9]","This is probably my very favorite movie - the one film that I would have to have if I was stranded on a desert island that, fortunately, had electric outlets, a televison and a DVD / VCR.In a time when we've all become accustomed to these panoramic epics which command a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars and seek to spell bind the audience with breath taking special effects, To Kill A Mockingbird succeeds without having to resort to any of these.This movie, filmed appropriately in black and white, tells the simple story of Atticus Finch, an attorney in the south of the 1930's who is raising his two children, Scout and Jeb. The story is seen through the eyes of Scout, a young girl, who is narrating the story many years later as a grown woman. And this is one of the important elements of this film. To Kill A Mockingbird is seen from a child's perspective and, as such, men like Atticus and the poor black man charged with the crime, Tom Robinson are seen as very honourable men (which is what they were.!!) almost wearing white hats while the evil people in the movie - the woman wrongfull accusing Tom of rape and her white, trailer trash father - are thoroughly despicable individuals more to be pitied than to be hated.The movie's focal point - and it certainly was a very powerful one in 1963 when this movie was made - concerned Atticus Finch's defense of a black man who had wrongfully been charged with the sexual assault of a white woman, a crime in the 1930's south that usually bypassed the courts entriely and went directly to the nearest tree which had a limb big enough to throw a noose over.This movie, of course, addresses racism and it must have opened alot of eyes in the 1960's when it was made in terms of addressing the progress, or lack thereof, that had been made in the intervening 30 years.But more than that, it was very much a movie about growing up and how we saw the world and our parent(s) and adults and good and evil. The conclusions we came to and how the events of our youth shaped our lives and made us the people that we are today. It showed us, for example, that the boogey man ""Boo Radley""- wonderfully played by a young Robert Duval - was not so scary when you understood the real ""boogeyman"" was the flesh and blood father of the woman who cried rape.Needless to say, Gregory Peck, who won the Best Actor award for his incredible performance of the decent Atticus Finch, was riveting. In a very low key and understated way, Atticus quietly exemplified all of the best qualities an individual could possess - honour, honesty, self-respect.This wonderful movie was based on Harper Lee's best selling Pulitzer prize winning novel. Surprisingly, Harper Lee never published anything more of significance after this book. In retrospect, how could you possibly follow up ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". I think it would have been comparable to following the Beatles after their initial Ed Sullivan appearance.This movie is one of those rare adaptations that actually adhered exclusively to the book and, as a result, was an artistic and commercial success. It's rare for a movie to ever approach the book in terms of quality (look at the movies based on Tom Clancey novels..!!).Another wonderful contribution to this film was the soundtrack. The almost haunting quality of the music, coupled with the black and white cinematography, created a wonderful mood - both during the film's ligher moments as well as the terrifying moments(as seen through the child's perspective). It's a beautiful soundtrack and certainly merits inclusion in your collection.This movie had a significant and lasting impact on me as an 11 year old seeing it for the first time. And many yearslater, it can still convey the same feelings in me that I felt back then. There's a very good reason why the book is considered mandatory reading in many American schools.If you're a lover of great films, then this movie is essential viewing.!",5,A Timeless Story For Everybody..,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,3953,"['probably', 'very', 'favorite', 'movie', 'one', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'was', 'stranded', 'desert', 'island', 'fortunately', 'had', 'electric', 'outlets', 'televison', 'DVD', '/', 'VCR.In', 'time', 'when', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'panoramic', 'epics', 'command', 'budget', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'seek', 'spell', 'audience', 'breath', 'taking', 'special', 'effects', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'having', 'resort', 'these.This', 'movie', 'filmed', 'appropriately', 'black', 'white', 'simple', 'story', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'attorney', 'south', '1930', 'who', 'raising', 'two', 'children', 'Scout', 'Jeb', 'story', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Scout', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'narrating', 'story', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'grown', 'woman', 'one', 'important', 'elements', 'film', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'seen', 'child', 'perspective', 'such', 'men', 'Atticus', 'poor', 'black', 'man', 'charged', 'crime', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'are', 'seen', 'very', 'honourable', 'men', 'what', 'were.', 'almost', 'wearing', 'white', 'hats', 'evil', 'people', 'movie', 'woman', 'wrongfull', 'accusing', 'Tom', 'rape', 'white', 'trailer', 'trash', 'father', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'despicable', 'individuals', 'more', 'be', 'pitied', 'be', 'hated.The', 'movie', 'focal', 'point', 'certainly', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'one', '1963', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'concerned', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'defense', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'wrongfully', 'been', 'charged', 'sexual', 'assault', 'white', 'woman', 'crime', '1930', 'south', 'usually', 'bypassed', 'courts', 'entriely', 'went', 'directly', 'nearest', 'tree', 'had', 'limb', 'big', 'enough', 'throw', 'noose', 'over.This', 'movie', 'course', 'racism', 'must', 'have', 'opened', 'alot', 'eyes', '1960', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'terms', 'addressing', 'progress', 'lack', 'thereof', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'intervening', '30', 'years.But', 'more', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'how', 'saw', 'world', 'parent', 's', 'adults', 'good', 'evil', 'conclusions', 'came', 'how', 'events', 'youth', 'shaped', 'lives', 'made', 'people', 'are', 'today', 'showed', 'example', 'boogey', 'man', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'young', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'scary', 'when', 'understood', 'real', 'boogeyman', 'was', 'flesh', 'blood', 'father', 'woman', 'who', 'cried', 'rape.Needless', 'say', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'incredible', 'performance', 'decent', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'was', 'riveting', 'very', 'low', 'key', 'understated', 'way', 'Atticus', 'quietly', 'exemplified', 'best', 'qualities', 'individual', 'could', 'possess', 'honour', 'honesty', 'self-respect.This', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'best', 'selling', 'Pulitzer', 'prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'Surprisingly', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'never', 'published', 'anything', 'more', 'significance', 'book', 'retrospect', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'follow', 'up', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'comparable', 'following', 'Beatles', 'initial', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'appearance.This', 'movie', 'one', 'rare', 'adaptations', 'actually', 'adhered', 'exclusively', 'book', 'result', 'was', 'artistic', 'commercial', 'success', 'rare', 'movie', 'ever', 'approach', 'book', 'terms', 'quality', 'look', 'movies', 'based', 'Tom', 'Clancey', 'novels..', '.Another', 'wonderful', 'contribution', 'film', 'was', 'soundtrack', 'almost', 'haunting', 'quality', 'music', 'coupled', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'created', 'wonderful', 'mood', 'film', 'ligher', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'terrifying', 'moments', 'seen', 'child', 'perspective', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'certainly', 'merits', 'inclusion', 'collection.This', 'movie', 'had', 'significant', 'lasting', 'impact', '11', 'year', 'old', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'yearslater', 'can', 'still', 'convey', 'same', 'feelings', 'felt', 'back', 'then', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'book', 'considered', 'mandatory', 'reading', 'many', 'American', 'schools.If', ""'re"", 'lover', 'great', 'films', 'then', 'movie', 'essential', 'viewing']",N/A
50701,A36EW68H08UOCS,0783222955,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 3]","Harper Lee wrote a semi-autobiographical novel about memories she made growing up in small town Alabama during that time between the Civil War and World War II, when blacks had been emancipated, but many whites, especially in the South, were reluctant to acknowledge blacks as equals.  The setting of this story preceded Martin Luther King, Jr's work by two decades. The novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the most important, passionate, beloved, spiritual and moral works in the English language.  It rightfully was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, and if only one had been awarded for the entire 20th century, it would still get my vote.Rightfully so, Harper Lee was hesitant to see her beloved story turned over to ""Hollywood"".  She needn't have worried.""To Kill a Mockingbird"", the film, has become as beloved as Harper Lee's book.  When the American Film Institute came out with their many ""100 Greatest..."" lists at the turn of the century Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch came out at #1 on the list of ""Greatest Screen Heroes"", ahead of such screen icons as Indiana Jones, James Bond and Rick from ""Casablanca"".  The film itself ranked as #34 of Greatest Films of history.  I would personally rank it in the top 2.The story is relatively simple.  A black man, Tom Robinson (in a noble performance by Brock Peters) is accused of raping a young woman from a ""white trash"" family.  The guilt of the black man is a foregone conclusion in this predominantly white southern town, but the Judge knows the only man in town with a chance to defend Tom.  The Judge asks Atticus Finch.  Atticus Finch is a widower, raising his two children on the salary of a small-town southern lawyer, frequently taking livestock and vegetables in trade for his services.  Atticus has many friends in town, and everyone who knows Mr. Finch knows that he is a man of saint-like honor.  Atticus never brags and much of what his own children learn about him comes from other adults who have known him for years.Wisely approaching the movie from the same perspective as Harper Lee's original narrative, Robert Mulligan tells the story from the perspective of the Finch children: Mary Badham as daughter Scout (who seems about 10) and slightly older brother Phillip Alford as Jem.  Scout and Jem do the things that children do.  They play hide and seek.  They tell ghost stories.  They roll tires down the street.  And, most importantly, they watch their father defend an innocent man who is sometimes an inch away from being lynched.The courtroom scenes are taut, with racial conflict simmering away like a pot threatening to boil over at any moment.  Atticus Finch keeps the lid on that pot.  The courtroom scenes here have not been matched by any film before or since.  Gregory Peck confided to Director Mulligan that he had won the Academy Award for him in just the scene at the end of the trial where Atticus silently packs up his papers and walks out of the courtroom.  If you haven't seen the film before - watch for this moment and you'll know what he meant.Supporting performances perfectly compliment the transcendant one by Mr. Peck.  Robert Duvall makes an impressive screen debut in an important role that doesn't appear until the final moments.  Collin Wilcox Paxton captures the pitiful ""victim"" of the alleged rape, Mayella Ewell.  James Anderson is terrifying as Mayella's spitefully prejudiced father, Bob Ewell.  Estelle Evans plays Calpurnia, who mothers the motherless Finch children when Atticus must be away.  Frank Overton is authoritative and one of the only professional friends Atticus has as Sheriff Tate.  Paul Fix presides over the famous courtroom scenes, in addition to asking Atticus to carry the unbearable load of defending the case that can't be defended in that town at that time.In America (and, dare I say, other parts of the world) issues of prejudice and racism have not completely subsided.

Sibley,"[9, 9]","Every so often, as surely as night follows day, a film comes along that manages to transport us from our everyday lives and into a time and place that is recalled through memories of better and in a reversal of fortunes, turbulent times. To Kill A Mockingbird is such a film.In a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, the small town of Macomb, Alabama is portrayed in the summer of 1932, during the deepest depression that the United States had ever experienced. Over the course of the next year and a half, events will burrow inside this sleepy southern town and the lives of its residents will be transported by actions, ideas, perceptions and convictions that will influence one and all in ways that will ring true for years to come.Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is a lawyer and widower, raising two small children, Scout (Mary Badham) and her older brother Jem (Phillip Alford). Into their lives enters a visitor, Dill (John Megna) from Meridian, Mississippi, come to spend two weeks with his Aunt Stephanie (Alice Ghostley). Macomb is a town with nothing to do and if there were, no money to spend on it. The stage is being set for a life shattering episode that will not go quietly into that good night.Childhood holds its fascinations, its myths, its coming of age and through the eyes of the three children, the audience is allowed to peer into the adult world around them as perceived through the minds and souls of innocence that will be all too easily shattered as time whistles down the track. One of the stories woven so masterfully within its covers is the local urban legend of bogeyman, Boo Radley (Robert Duval), who lives on the same block as the Finch family. In a narration, rather like playing telephone, his persona takes on all the familiar attributes of a raving lunatic, a monster out for blood. His aura becomes the end all for Scout, Jem and Dill as they seek to master the mystery surrounding Boo and the ability to live to tell the tale!Into this world of innocence, a shattering crescendo of complexity wraps itself in the lives of the townspeople in the form of an alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Violet Ewell (Collin Wilcox) by a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). Atticus Finch is called upon to act as counsel for Robinson and in doing so, the stage has been set for a dance with race relations and the exemplary lengths that are gone to in order to allow justice to prevail in the face of malcontent.The performances throughout To Kill A Mockingbird are stunning. Gregory Peck, as the gentleman lawyer, mired in small town attitudes and thoughts that were so representational in the southern gothic sphere, has collected and held a restrained order to his character, and in the process, he has allowed us all to be on the receiving end of hate as conveyed through the actions of small minds and small people. The children, especially Mary Badham, are siblings of more than a movie making venture. They show the absence of preconceived notions, and the guile of beings before the actions of adults can render their world as lost and gone with the shedding of time.James Anderson as Tom Ewell is the complete representation of oily slime as Mayella's father. He embodies all of the hate and prejudice that continues to be harboured to this day in the souls of those who would attempt to wield their vision of the way things should and ought to be. He has a foul baseness that lingers like a bad rash as he attempts to invoke his arguments through drunken bullying and hatred. Collin Willcox as Mayella is excruciatingly convincing as the bored, housebound white woman who tries to tempt Tom Robinson into kissing her and through her actions sets in motion a rollercoaster of tragedy to come. Her speech to the assembled courtroom is superb and as the audience, you feel her anger and resentment at having to be put in such a position, having to lie to save face and what little position she has in the town. Brock Peters as the aforementioned Robinson is equally sure in the allotted time he spends on the screen. There is a noble demeanor to his bearing, and yet we are aware of the restrictions that blacks were held to in their relationships with whites at the time.Robert Mulligan, the director and Horton Foote, the screenwriter, have presented us with a look into our pasts and faithfully etched a portrait of quiet and artfully rendered proportions that draw us into the canvas and the lives of those assembled. We have walked a mile in their shoes and been under their skin. Foote worried about being able to do justice to Lee's novel, but he worried for nothing. He has completely evoked an era that now rests behind clouds of dust, blown by the winds of time into oblivion.The cinematography by Russell Harlan and the set decoration by Oliver Emert carry us back through the courtesy of black and white to a depiction seen only in old photographs and clouding memories of those who lived in those precarious times. Black and white films seem to have had a curse thrust upon them by the younger generation today, as boring and tedious, but through the courtesies extended by Harlan and Emert, we are richer for those perceptions that would harken back throughout the pages of history.Elmer Bernstein's film score carries us like an old friend and helps us to make our acquaintances with the characters held within this framework. He has achieved much with a simple theme and persuades us that said simplicity is fulfilled with less rather than more.To Kill A Mockingbird is beautifully haunting and having been made in the 60's, at the height of the Civil Rights movement, it garners our attention to stop and take the time to truly 'see' what the human race is all about and what it can and should be, if taken over the bumps in the road and onto a path of sincere honesty and purpose. No special effects were needed, no huge Hollywood budget, no splashing of a story that had a happy ending for everyone involved. It is an open book into the realities of a world tilting temporarily off its axis, and being brought back on track through the goodness that sits in the hearts, minds and souls of mankind, if given half a chance.See it and be amazed at what real moviemaking is all about.",5,The Summer We Discovered Life,1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,6246,"['so', 'often', 'as', 'surely', 'night', 'day', 'film',

Lee ""mnl_1221""","[2, 2]","This past winter (2010), after losing a job and having very little money, I was driven to watch my VHS of To Kill a Mockingbird over and over again.  Yesterday (5/5/10) I finished the novel, and I wrote a separate review of that.  Here in this review of the film, I want to concentrate on two things: the images of fathers, and the music.As I kept viewing the film, I noticed that except for Atticus Finch, practically every father in the film is either absent or abusive.  Boo Radley's father cuts him off from the world; Bob Ewell gets drunk and beats his child, and doesn't stop there; Dill Harris' father has apparently abandoned him: after saying he ""hasn't got a father"" but he's ""not dead"", Dill then says his dad let him drive a railroad and one day will swoop him away on an airplane.  Even Tom Robinson, a hard-working Black man with a wife and children, is forced to abandon his family.  Probably Walter Cunningham Sr. does is best, but he is dirt-poor, and can't rise above the prejudices of his society without help.In contrast, Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), is kind, patient, analytical, discreet, approachable, humble, and courageous, providing an excellent example for his children.  Because he's not a macho man--he refuses to play football for the Methodists because he's too old--his children at first don't think he's much to be proud of, but boy do they learn!The other thing I want to mention is the music, written by Elmer Bernstein (no relation to Leonard Bernstein, though they were friends).  The main theme, played on flute, violins, then piano, is a haunting melody which probably speaks to the innocence of childhood and nostalgia for that innocence.

50711,A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1,0783222955,Melissa,"[3, 3]","I loved this DVD and movie in general. I loved the book when they made us read it about in Middle School. Since it's been ages since I've seen or read either I needed to get this video and I recieved it as a wonderful gift for Christmas. Though, it took me a while to watch it. When I did watch it however, it really does make you think back to those times. And some things I didn't even catch when I was younger that I do as an adult. The story is told by a grown up Scout who was rather a Tom Boy. Her and her brother growing up with their father who's a lawyer. The story intellengently touches on perhapes three stories in one. One story is of the family in general, the second one is the story of the kids wanting to know about their neighbor Boo Bradley. The third and most thought provoking and sometimes hard to watch because of it being so dramatic is where the father defends a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. That scene in general was outstanding. It's easy to see that Gregory Peck won an academy award for best actor. The movie makes you want to read the book, which does give more detail. However, the great thing about this movie is not for the actor's but the fact that it really does follow the book.As for the DVD it's self it was a pleasure to navigate around. Has a wonderful information on production notes. And the idea of an author (Harper Lee) loving a Screen Play is quite unknown so that just tells you how much this movie is loved. The only thing is that the sound was rather hard to hear, however I haven't been able to find a DVD or Video yet that had good sound with this movie. It's still worth the buy you won't be sorry, the picture is great for a black and white film and it's fun re-watching a child's adventure in the times of a depression. I recommend this movie for anyone who's old enough to understand this film, and I garentee after you watch the movie you'll want to read the book.

Eugeni,"[5, 8]","To Kill a Mockingbird is immensely simple, echoing the languid mood of a small town, pre-television, pre-suburban isolation, and very much in the midst of ignorance and prejudice. Main character is Scout, a child growing up with older brother Jem who longs for manhood and her father Atticus Finch, a uniquely dedicated lawyer and good man. Racism is the issue that stands out in the end, but TKAM is more an exploration of a time and place that most of us will never--and might never hope to--know. What action exists is observed by a mysterious neighbor and the stoic dad. Don't be fooled by the slow pace; there are myriad joys and hopes to be found in this film.Collector's Edition DVD includes Fearful Symmetry, a wonderfully illuminating documentary about the making of the film and the basis for its story and characters. It starts slow but the messages (some rathy wordy) are poignant. Narration includes many quotes from the book, details that are left out of the movie in effort to translate to screen.

50714,AY3EENC2BGTGK,0783222955,"M. G. Gagliano ""Maria""","[3, 5]","The 411 by Maria:Unlike a lot of my friends, I don't recall having to read this book in school but then again, that was a long time ago. If I am going to watch or read something, I don't like to read the synopsis so I had no idea what the movie was about when I started.The movie is set in the 1930's and focus on Atticus Finch played magnificently by Gregory Peck and his two children, Jem and Scout (more on them later). Atticus is a respected attorney who has been commissioned to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a woman in her own home.What I Can Tell You:Wow, where do I start. I was completely floored with this movie. Gregory Peck performance is completely stunning! The fact that he won best actor for the role was not lost on me, completely worthy of it and one of the best acting I have ever seen. However, after seeing some of the bonus features, I believe he was pretty much playing himself!  A gentle, kind soul, whose thoughtfulness and mannerisms bring out the best in those around him. He allows, after a gentle nudge to make their own assumptions and mistakes in life in hopes of becoming a better person.The actress who played Scout was unbelievably ""real"". You would never believe that this child was not Gregory Peck's daughter. There is real love there and I was n awe of how much acting had to be done. Most emotions were seen not heard. Without the use of a soundtrack and a whole lot of dialogue these actors really have to ACT! You can hear everything. The actors are not bogged down with dialogue, the scene is set, and you act!The quietness of the whole movie is really what got me. When I discussed it with people after watching, those who have seen or have not, that was what I mentioned most. I appreciated the quietness. For such a sensitive subject matter, I felt that if this was being done today, the deepness of it would be lost in translation.I have so many favorite scenes:Scout saying goodnight to her father and asking what he has to pass on to her when he is gone.Brock Peters taking the stand. His emotion was so real!Atticus speaking to his children. He is such a gentle, caring man who obviously loves his children.Scout and Jem's relationship. Anytime they were on the screen I was in love.Scout talking to the gang who headed to the jail to take the law in their own hands. Her innocence was palpable.Scout talking to Boo Radley after he helped her and her brother.If you do get the Blu-ray, take time to watch the bonus features. Truly a blessing to have this footage. Well worth your time.To Kill a Mockingbird won Academy Awards for Best Actor (Peck), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Art Direction. Truly a classic and one that everyone should watch.  This is when acting was actually acting. No green screens, no classy soundtracks, no glamorous special effects, just acting at its finest.",5,Timeless Classic!,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,2862,"['411', 'Maria', 'lot', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'school', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'am', 'going', 'watch', 'read', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'read', 'synopsis', 'so', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'started.The', 'movie', 'set', '1930', 'focus', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'two', 'children', 'Jem', 'Scout', 'more', 'later', 'Atticus', 'respected', 'attorney', 'who', 'been', 'commissioned', 'represent', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'black', 'man', 'accused', 'raping', 'woman', 'own', 'home.What', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Wow', 'where', 'do', 'start', 'was', 'completely', 'floored', 'movie', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'performance', 'completely', 'stunning', 'fact', 'won', 'best', 'actor', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'lost', 'completely', 'one', 'best', 'acting', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'However', 'seeing', 'bonus', 'believe', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'playing', 'gentle', 'kind', 'soul', 'thoughtfulness', 'mannerisms', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'gentle', 'nudge', 'make', 'own', 'assumptions', 'mistakes', 'life', 'hopes', 'becoming', 'better', 'person.The', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Scout', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'real', 'would', 'never', 'believe', 'child', 'was', 'not', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'daughter', 'real', 'was', 'n', 'awe', 'how', 'much', 'acting', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'Most', 'emotions', 'were', 'seen', 'not', 'heard', 'use', 'soundtrack', 'whole', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'really', 'have', 'ACT', 'can', 'hear', 'everything', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'bogged', 'down', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'set', 'act', 'quietness', 'whole', 'movie', 'really', 'what', 'got', 'When', 'discussed', 'people', 'watching', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'not', 'was', 'what', 'mentioned', 'most', 'appreciated', 'quietness', 'such', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'today', 'deepness', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'translation.I', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'Scout', 'saying', 'goodnight', 'father', 'asking', 'what', 'pass', 'when', 'gone.Brock', 'Peters', 'taking', 'stand', 'emotion', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'Atticus', 'speaking', 'children', 'such', 'gentle', 'caring', 'man', 'who', 'obviously', 'children.Scout', 'Jem', 'relationship', 'were', 'screen', 'was', 'love.Scout', 'talking', 'gang', 'who', 'headed', 'jail', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'innocence', 'was', 'palpable.Scout', 'talking', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'helped', 'brother.If', 'do', 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'bonus', 'features', 'Truly', 'blessing', 'have', 'footage', 'Well', 'time.To', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'won', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Peck', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Truly', 'classic', 'one', 'everyone', 'should', 'watch', 'when', 'acting', 'was', 'actually', 'acting', 'green', 'screens', 'classy', 'soundtracks', 'glamorous', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'acting', 'finest']",N/A

Mary Badham, Philip Alford and John Megna as the children are priceless; Robert Duvall in a small but pivotal role is magnificent; Colin Wilcox as the so-called rape victim gives a dynamic performance, as does Brock Peters as the accused.  Estelle Evans as Calpurnia, the housekeeper, evokes the warmth and maternal kindness of a caring housekeeper, and Frank Overton as the sheriff has a fine moment in the end of the movie.

It is one of the rare instances where the movie is almost as good as the book, written by Harper Lee.This is the Legacy Series edition of this movie and contains additional features for ardent fans of this incredible work. Contained here, along with the movie on disc one, are Gregory Peck's Academy Award acceptance speech for best actor, his remarks from the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, an excerpt from the Academy's tribute to Gregory Peck, an interview with Mary Badham (Scout), feature commentary from the Director and Producer and the theatrical trailer.Disc two includes a well produced documentary titled ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"" where Peck reminisces his stellar career and interacts with audiences and past co-stars. Here Peck's somewhat controversial social activism is touched on, which may be a turn off to some as he was a staunch and vocal advocate of gun control, withdrawal from Viet Nam and other activist issues of that age. This disc also includes the making of the movie, which is an exceptional feature.Also included in the Legacy Series edition are eleven matted reproductions of original theatrical posters, which would be suitable for framing for collectors of such memorabilia.

It was easy to predict that Hannibal Lecter would be the top villain.  But as the countdown progressed, I wondered who would be the top hero.  My personal film hero has always been Atticus Finch, but as the Superman and Indiana Jones characters were being named in the final few slots, I didn't think the AFI voters would agree with me.  I was genuinely surprised, and very, very pleased, that the top film hero named was, indeed, Atticus Finch.I then started to think why it was I considered this character a hero, because certainly in Atticus Finch's mind, he wasn't doing ""heroic"" things.  He defended Tom Robinson not to be looked upon as saintly or holier than thou, but because he wanted to set a good example for his children -- and, very simply, he thought it was the right thing to do.  I think Atticus Finch's quiet devotion to his children, and his belief in doing what was decent and right in his life and profession, made this character a hero in my eyes.  As an attorney, I think often of Gregory Peck's summation in the film when I'm preparing for a trial.

The big mystery for the children is, who lives in the big, old scary house down the block? Their goal in life that summer is to find out who lives there. Most of us who grew up in the era where we had a lot of freedom to play outside and didn't have any fear about it will not only relate to the things those kids get into, but the horror that one hateful,white racist tries to do to Atticus through his children.Even though this is seen through the eyes of children, I wouldn't recommend it for children, especially young children---it could cause nightmares.

50745,ACAE6O42VX2BQ,0783222955,Patrik Lemberg,"[5, 5]","""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is at the time of my writing this ranked at #41 on IMDb's top 250 list (of movies of all time.)I haven't read Harper Lee's price-winning novel on which the movie is based, but watching the movie today (my second time in a year) reminded me of how much I wanted to experience the original story, in print, in addition to the film.Gregory Peck, who'd started working on Broadway and in movies 20 years prior to this film, does a very stable and critically acclaimed (Oscar rewarded) performance as Atticus Finch - a small town lawyer who, in 1930's Southern America, is defending a colored man (accused for rape by a white woman) in court.Much of this 1962 B&W; movie, which incidentally includes Robert Duvall's film-debut, is played out through the eyes of Finch's motherless children, ""Jem"" and ""Scout.""I recommend it highly to anybody anywhere, regardless of age and culture, as it contains no ""foul language"" or ""severe violence."" Sure - the story might not be very accessible to a five year old, but the content of the movie is not bound to hurt anyone. For all the viewer is aware, this could be a recreation of actual historic events, which it in a sense is.The music, composed by Elmer Bernstein, undoubtedly suites the picture and partly reminds me of musical elements (harmonically and in instrumentation) from harp-dominated 1950's Ingmar Bergman pictures (such as ""Smiles of a Summer Night."")Though probably not within the incoming year or two, I'm sure I'm going to watch this movie again.The well-restored sound and (widescreen) picture of this DVD features an insightful 90 minute long ""making of"" documentary as well as a theatrical trailer and biographies over the movie's main actors. There are also Spanish subtitles and a French audio track.For a regular film-lover to leave this classic unwatched would be like killing a mockingbird.OBSERVE: This review, which I wrote in March 2005, was not for the gold cover Collector's Edition, for which the review currently appears!",5,Acknowledged masterpiece,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2015,"['Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'time', 'writing', 'ranked', '41', 'IMDb', 'top', '250', 'list', 'movies', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'price-winning', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'watching', 'movie', 'today', 'second', 'time', 'year', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'experience', 'original', 'story', 'print', 'addition', 'film.Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', ""'d"", 'started', 'working', 'Broadway', 'movies', '20', 'years', 'prior', 'film', 'very', 'stable', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Oscar', 'rewarded', 'performance', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'small', 'town', 'lawyer', 'who', '1930', 'Southern', 'America', 'defending', 'colored', 'man', 'accused', 'rape', 'white', 'woman', 'court.Much', '1962', 'B', 'W', 'movie', 'incidentally', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'film-debut', 'played', 'out', 'eyes', 'Finch', 'motherless', 'children', 'Jem', 'Scout', 'recommend', 'highly', 'anybody', 'anywhere', 'regardless', 'age', 'culture', 'foul', 'language', 'severe', 'violence', 'Sure', 'story', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'accessible', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'content', 'movie', 'not', 'bound', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'viewer', 'aware', 'could', 'be', 'recreation', 'actual', 'historic', 'events', 'sense', 'is.The', 'music', 'composed', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'undoubtedly', 'picture', 'partly', 'musical', 'elements', 'harmonically', 'instrumentation', 'harp-dominated', '1950', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'such', 'Smiles', 'Summer', 'Night', 'Though', 'probably', 'not', 'incoming', 'year', 'two', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'well-restored', 'sound', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'DVD', 'insightful', '90', 'minute', 'long', 'making', 'documentary', 'as', 'well', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'biographies', 'movie', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'French', 'audio', 'track.For', 'regular', 'film-lover', 'leave', 'classic', 'unwatched', 'would', 'be', 'killing', 'mockingbird.OBSERVE', 'review', 'wrote', 'March', '2005', 'was', 'not', 'gold', 'cover', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'review', 'currently']",N/A

There were years when my passion for reading took a back seat to being a wife, a mom, a part of the work force that keeps society moving, money in the bank account. Reading never stopped, but time became a luxury I often had to steal for an occasional book. Today, when I might have three books going at once, plus all the internet information I can devour, bliss is mine. Now, as I read To Kill a Mockingbird, I'm beyond sad that this feast was denied me so long. Given the current, woeful state of the world, of national politics, reading this book has provided me a deeper well of comprehension of racial realities of which I was aware, certainly, which offended me, throughout my life.

My personal favorite was Atticus Finch (portrayed brilliantly by Peck). He was a brave man who didn't have to use his fist or a gun to get his message across. He embodied goodness, justice, virtue, integrity, courage--all relative qualities that I associate with honorable men. Scout and Jem were fortunate to have him as a father--and as a role model, too!This Legacy edition is definitive for all DVD collections. As for the film itself, it's timeless.

With this new DVD version of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, I have developed an even  greater appreciation of this timeless story told through the eyes of Scout.  While this story is timeless, I was taken aback to see how much the times  have really changed.  What other story could depict the legal profession in  such a noble manner?  After watching Atticus Finch argue on behalf of Tom  Robinson, there is no one  who could not help but have some great  admiration for the role of the lawyer.  There is much to contrast with our  notion of lawyers today... self-absorbed fictional lawyers such as  &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and pandering &quot;real-life&quot; lawyers like  the O.J. defense team.  Perhaps this can be attributed to the obvious  nature of evil in simpler times when the values were black and white.  This  DVD version is beautifully re-mastered in B/W...I was especially enthralled  by the scenes of Jem, Scout and Dill at the old Radley House, and of Jem  and Scout's &quot;final journey&quot; together through the woods.  These  Southern gothic scenes evoke all of the childhood fears and insecurities  which most of us remember, over the backdrop of extreme societel repression  and cruel poverty.

Gregory Peck's usual wooden acting style is perfect here as Atticus. The three children are wonderfully natural, as are the other actors, but the real stars are the novel itself, Horton Foote's screenplay, Robert Mulligan's direction, and Elmer Bernstein's haunting score.Has there ever been a more effective scene than when at the end of the trial the Black minister turns to Scout and says ""Miss Jean Louise, stand up, your father is passing""? Or a better ending? Or a better object lesson about race and class? I don't think so. Citizen Kane may be a better movie, from a technical sense, but for me, I have never been more affected by a film emotionally than by To Kill a Mockingbird.

50778,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0783222955,Robert Morris,"[6, 6]","In his later years, Peck acknowledged that Atticus Finch was his favorite role among many such as Frank Savage in Twelve O'Clock High and Phil Green in Gentleman's Agreement. Peck was the perfect choice to play Finch and received an Academy Award for best actor for that performance. Finch is the central character in Harper Lee's autobiographical novel. A widower with two young children, he supports himself and his family as an attorney in a small town in Alabama during the Great Depression. When Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) is accused of rape, Finch agrees to represent the young black man. This decision antagonizes several of the town's racist whites.The action is seen through Lee's persona, ""Scout"" (Mary Badham), the younger of the two Finch children. The trial becomes the focal point of the narrative, with the courtroom becoming Finch's pulpit. His eloquent appeals for justice and racial tolerance are directed to everyone in the town, not only to members of the jury. As directed by Robert Mulligan, all members of the cast perform brilliantly. Of special interest is the screen debut of Robert Duvall as Boo Radley, a mysterious recluse who eventually becomes significantly involved in the plot. Thanks to Peck's skills under Mulligan's direction, this is not a ""preachy"" film. Finch is as credible to those who see this film as he is to those in the town in which he and his children live. When making word associations with the name Gregory Peck, intelligence, integrity, and dignity immediately come to mind. All three describe Finch. Credit must also be given to Horton Foote who wrote the highly literate screenplay based on Lee's autobiographical novel. This is a great film primarily because it contains a great performance by Peck and because (through Finch) it makes a power appeal to the best that is within us, whatever the color of our skin may be.",5,Actor and Role in Perfect Alignment,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,1876,"['later', 'years', 'Peck', 'acknowledged', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'was', 'favorite', 'role', 'many', 'such', 'Frank', 'Savage', 'Twelve', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'Phil', 'Green', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'Peck', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'Finch', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actor', 'performance', 'Finch', 'central', 'character', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'widower', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'family', 'attorney', 'small', 'town', 'Alabama', 'Great', 'Depression', 'When', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'Brock', 'Peters', 'accused', 'rape', 'Finch', 'represent', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'decision', 'several', 'town', 'racist', 'whites.The', 'action', 'seen', 'Lee', 'persona', 'Scout', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'younger', 'two', 'Finch', 'children', 'trial', 'focal', 'point', 'narrative', 'courtroom', 'becoming', 'Finch', 'pulpit', 'eloquent', 'appeals', 'justice', 'racial', 'tolerance', 'are', 'directed', 'everyone', 'town', 'not', 'only', 'members', 'jury', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'members', 'cast', 'perform', 'brilliantly', 'special', 'interest', 'screen', 'debut', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'mysterious', 'recluse', 'who', 'eventually', 'significantly', 'involved', 'plot', 'Thanks', 'Peck', 'skills', 'Mulligan', 'direction', 'not', 'preachy', 'film', 'Finch', 'credible', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'town', 'children', 'live', 'When', 'making', 'word', 'associations', 'name', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'intelligence', 'integrity', 'dignity', 'immediately', 'come', 'mind', 'three', 'describe', 'Finch', 'Credit', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'who', 'wrote', 'highly', 'literate', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Lee', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'great', 'film', 'primarily', 'great', 'performance', 'Peck', 'Finch', 'power', 'appeal', 'best', 'color', 'skin', 'may', 'be']",N/A

Mulligan's 1962 film and you will see why it (unlike many of today's contenders) is a true American masterpiece.Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, this film narrates the realities of growing up in the south during the depression while watching her father defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.The difficult subjects of racism and the legal system are addressed in a timeless response that does not fade despite comparatively more advanced filming techniques or altering legal realities.As the Anglo protagonist Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck delivers one of the most excellent character performances of his film career. His task in the throes of segregation is a gloomy prospect (with judges and jurors predisposed to bias against your client from day one) but Finch trudges stoically on throughout the screenplay.This imparts to his children the importance of standing up for what you believe in and being an open minded person that tries to treat everybody fairly. Certainly the family faces retribution from narrow-minded community members, but the children learn those attacks are a small price to pay for the greater good of a society without bias and injustice. It is better to place yourself on the line for your principles than to say/do nothing and let things continue as they had always occurred.That in itself would be a powerful statement for a film produced during resurrection of the American civil rights movement, but it also tackles the biases surrounding people with disabilities in the character of Boo Radley.As the town ""idiot"", he is an enigma to the local children--who spend a considerable amount of time in the film fascinated by the rumors surrounding this man---until he becomes the one who saves Scout from vicious attack related to her father's case.  Like Jim, he represents the ""Mockingbird""-entities who do not harm anything else and therefore should be treated with kindness.Finally, Scout's proto-feminism in wondering why she would be treated differently than her younger brother foreshadows the resurrection of the feminist movement in America. Despite Atticus's comparatively progressive stance on race issues, he unwittingly bought into sexist assumptions about gender roles.",5,Actually I need to give it higher ratings,1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,2263,"['Just', 'one', 'glance', 'Robert', 'J.', 'Mulligan', '1962', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'many', 'today', 'contenders', 'true', 'American', 'masterpiece.Based', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'realities', 'growing', 'up', 'south', 'depression', 'watching', 'father', 'defend', 'black', 'man', 'accused', 'raping', 'white', 'woman.The', 'difficult', 'subjects', 'racism', 'legal', 'system', 'are', 'addressed', 'timeless', 'response', 'not', 'fade', 'comparatively', 'more', 'advanced', 'filming', 'techniques', 'altering', 'legal', 'realities.As', 'Anglo', 'protagonist', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'one', 'most', 'excellent', 'character', 'performances', 'film', 'career', 'task', 'throes', 'segregation', 'gloomy', 'prospect', 'judges', 'jurors', 'predisposed', 'bias', 'client', 'day', 'one', 'Finch', 'stoically', 'screenplay.This', 'children', 'importance', 'standing', 'up', 'what', 'believe', 'being', 'open', 'minded', 'person', 'treat', 'everybody', 'fairly', 'Certainly', 'family', 'retribution', 'narrow-minded', 'community', 'members', 'children', 'learn', 'attacks', 'are', 'small', 'price', 'pay', 'greater', 'good', 'society', 'bias', 'injustice', 'better', 'place', 'line', 'principles', 'say/do', 'nothing', 'let', 'things', 'continue', 'had', 'always', 'occurred.That', 'would', 'be', 'powerful', 'statement', 'film', 'produced', 'resurrection', 'American', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'also', 'biases', 'surrounding', 'people', 'disabilities', 'character', 'Boo', 'Radley.As', 'town', 'idiot', 'enigma', 'local', 'children', 'who', 'spend', 'considerable', 'amount', 'time', 'film', 'fascinated', 'rumors', 'surrounding', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'Scout', 'vicious', 'attack', 'related', 'father', 'case', 'Jim', 'Mockingbird', '-entities', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'harm', 'anything', 'else', 'therefore', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'kindness.Finally', 'Scout', 'proto-feminism', 'wondering', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'treated', 'differently', 'younger', 'brother', 'resurrection', 'feminist', 'movement', 'America', 'Atticus', 'comparatively', 'progressive', 'stance', 'race', 'issues', 'unwittingly', 'bought', 'sexist', 'assumptions', 'gender', 'roles']",N/A
50782,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,0783222955,Rocco Dormarunno,"[2, 3]","Midway through this outstanding movie, Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) defends a black man accused of raping a white woman in an Alabama town during the Depression. As the tensions of the trial reach fever pitch, Atticus is summoned home to protect his family from a rabid dog. The mad dog, an obvious symbol of the madness of prejudice (and the only symbolism in the movie) is killed by just one shot from Finch. This is one of the simple themes of the movie: all you have to do is confront and face bigotry, in order to eliminate it.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is undoubtedly one of the most important and most engaging movies of post-WWII America, and a cinematic emblem for the civil rights movement of that era. From the incredible opening credits, complete with Elmer Bernstein's heartbreakingly beautiful score, you know you're in for a great movie. Seen through the eyes of Atticus' tomboy daughter, Scout, the film runs the familiar gamut of a child's world: the scary neighbor; the new kid in town; the first day of school; and the need to be close to a parent. But the aptly named Scout also sees something that most other children do not: the dark world of grown-ups' hate.But Scout is not just an observer; she's a fighter who's not afraid to duke it out with the boys in her school. In this way, she is a sort of foil for her father whose fighting spirit is internal, calm, but just as effective. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is full of outstanding performances. Gregory Peck is appropriately understated, although passionate when the moment calls for it. A very young Robert Duvall, in the bit but pivotal role of Boo Radley, conveys the pathos of a manchild locked away from the rest of the world. I defy anyone to watch Brock Peters as the wrongly accused Tom Robinson and not be moved. However, the movie is carried by the amazing and convincing performances of the child actors, Mary Badham as Scout and Philip Alford as her brother Jem. They are so genuine, so not like child &quot;stars&quot; (because they weren't), that, at times, you forget you are watching little actors.This is a film to be watched on several levels but none more important than its stirring interpretation of childhood rapidly coming to terms with the adult world around them. It sounds trite and banal, but Horton Foote's screeplay, Robert Mulligan's textured direction, and the performances, sidestep any temptation to take the easy path of cliche. This is a demanding movie that requires a lot from us as film watchers and as human beings.",5,Killing the mad dog of prejudice,1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,2520,"['Midway', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'black', 'man', 'accused', 'raping', 'white', 'woman', 'Alabama', 'town', 'Depression', 'tensions', 'trial', 'reach', 'fever', 'pitch', 'Atticus', 'summoned', 'home', 'protect', 'family', 'rabid', 'dog', 'mad', 'dog', 'obvious', 'symbol', 'madness', 'prejudice', 'only', 'symbolism', 'movie', 'killed', 'just', 'one', 'shot', 'Finch', 'one', 'simple', 'themes', 'movie', 'have', 'do', 'confront', 'face', 'bigotry', 'order', 'eliminate', 'it.TO', 'KILL', 'A', 'MOCKINGBIRD', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'most', 'engaging', 'movies', 'post-WWII', 'America', 'cinematic', 'emblem', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'era', 'incredible', 'opening', 'credits', 'complete', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'heartbreakingly', 'beautiful', 'score', 'know', ""'re"", 'great', 'movie', 'eyes', 'Atticus', 'tomboy', 'daughter', 'Scout', 'film', 'familiar', 'gamut', 'child', 'world', 'scary', 'neighbor', 'new', 'kid', 'town', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'need', 'be', 'close', 'parent', 'aptly', 'named', 'Scout', 'also', 'something', 'most', 'other', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'dark', 'world', 'grown-ups', 'hate.But', 'Scout', 'not', 'just', 'observer', 'fighter', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'duke', 'out', 'boys', 'school', 'way', 'sort', 'foil', 'father', 'fighting', 'spirit', 'internal', 'calm', 'just', 'effective', 'TO', 'KILL', 'A', 'MOCKINGBIRD', 'full', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'appropriately', 'understated', 'passionate', 'when', 'moment', 'very', 'young', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'bit', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Boo', 'Radley', 'pathos', 'manchild', 'locked', 'away', 'rest', 'world', 'defy', 'anyone', 'watch', 'Brock', 'Peters', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'However', 'movie', 'carried', 'amazing', 'convincing', 'performances', 'child', 'actors', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'Scout', 'Philip', 'Alford', 'brother', 'Jem', 'are', 'so', 'genuine', 'so', 'not', 'child', 'quot', 'stars', 'quot', 'were', ""n't"", 'times', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'little', 'actors.This', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'several', 'levels', 'none', 'more', 'important', 'stirring', 'interpretation', 'childhood', 'rapidly', 'coming', 'terms', 'adult', 'world', 'trite', 'banal', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'screeplay', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'textured', 'direction', 'performances', 'sidestep', 'temptation', 'take', 'easy', 'path', 'cliche', 'demanding', 'movie', 'lot', 'film', 'watchers', 'human', 'beings']",N/A

I have watched it, or listened to it, several times, as I sew or draw, or work in my little home-office. Although the subject matter is very painful at times, to watch or to listen to,(I get angry all over again; as I did the first time I watched the movie, especially listening to the court proceedings), I tend to get a strange sense of understanding, as I watch the story play out. The father figure, Gregory Peck, teaches his children, in very well chosen, thought out, loving words about the ugliness, as well as the beauty that this world can bring.  The first time I watched the movie, and found out the fate of the victim on trial, I was horrified, but being the type of person that tends to want to ""see things through"" I continued to watch it, and I'm glad I did. The characters are real, the children so innocent. It is just too bad that ,still, in this day and time, our children's innocence can be changed, in a heart beat, by cruel, insensitive people, and or situations. However, in the end, there is so much that we can learn from this movie, regarding our behavior and or our feelings, towards people in our lives, who are ""different"", than we are. Whether the difference be race, color, gender, poverty, wealth, religious choice, being over weight, being under weight, being ""just too sensitive"" (in our opinions) to situations, or most especially,our tendencies of ""indifference, intolerance, and or inconsideration"", regarding the mentally or physically challenged people of this world, we ""will"" be made to stand accountable for our choices, after it is all said and done. This movie teaches us that we are all in this game of life together, and that we should learn to ""play fair"", respect and appreciate each other, for our diversities.  At the end of the day, that's all that counts.  To me, life would be so boring if everyone thought, looked, acted or even felt, ""just as I do"" about things. Sometimes I just get tired of myself. Please remember that this world does not revolve around ""us"" as individuals.  Sorry,(not really)to get preachy, but this movie gives us lots of food for thought.

The simplicity  of a father's touch, of a rapist's grimace, of the wind gently blowing  through the trees at dusk -- everything in this movie evokes, from Scout's  point of view, a time we each have in our lives that transforms us into  adults.  There comes with it an aching sadness -- as if saying goodbye to a  comforting old friend -- but the revelation carries with it a profound joy.  Elmer Bernstein's score realizes each emotional chord of the film, and  transports us without ever lambasting us -- it is the best kind of movie  score.

It is quite a simple story from the vantage of two motherless children who play around and are intrigued by an unknown fearful character in their neighbourhood reputed to be mad, and the events surrounding Gregory Peck, their father defending a black worker unjustly accused of raping a woman - during the 1930s when segregation was the norm in the south.Gregory Peck comes across as a very dignified, handsome, moral character - who abounds in justice and strong paternal qualities.  The true star of the show is Gregory Peck's daughter and her tomboy antics along with her brother and their friend.  Peck's character is a admirable lawyer defending a case which in all probability he will lose.  But the unfairness meted to the black defendant though forming a core aspect to this film is not centre stage.  What is centre stage is the children and their vision of the proceedings and the danger they are placed in from those who hate Peck's advocacy of a black man's justice.The music and overall atmosphere of the film describing quiet southern town life evokes a bygone age of innocence, friendliness and charm - along with the grosser aspects of intolerance at the time.

I identified with Jem and Scout and Dill and wished I could go with them on the heart-stopping excursions to Boo's house; I felt the broad spectrum of emotion that this classic evokes in me to this day, and when it was brought to the screen, there was nothing missing; it is a complete, intact translation into cinema and is, in my opinion, the best performance of Gregory Peck's career. I hated Mayella Ewell for a long time, until I realized what her life was truly like and the real villain here is her father. I felt so bad for Brock Peters, and I felt his hopelessness so keenly, it was hard to watch, much harder than it was to read, and the pain and resignation on his face still conjures up all the hate crimes that continue to this day, and reminds me, uncomfortably, of the truck dragging death in Texas. The setting is wonderful, the gifts in the tree from Boo are touching, and the feeling of sorrow when Mr. Radley fills up the hole is profound. Dill, the character drawn directly from Truman Capote, is one of my favorite characters, the old-young wisdom and mature vocabulary are a joy to watch. Calpurnia is solid and comforting in the fast-changing world of the Finch household, and you are glad she is there. The court-room scene is riveting, as is the byplay in the balcony, where Jem, Dill and Scout sneak in and watch the proceedings. The Reverend, when the trial is over, cautions the children to ""Stand up, your father is passing.."" so thankful is he that Atticus, although losing the case, has nevertheless made a strong statement by virtue of the fact that he kept the jury out so long...and of course, the end, when the children are attacked on their way home from a Halloween party at the school by none other than Tom Ewell. Boo saves their lives, and when Atticus agrees with the Sheriff to let it be, and leave Boo alone, Scout says, ""I understand...it would be like killing a mockingbird."" And Atticus sits up all night in Jem's room, and as Scout says, ""Atticus stayed there all night, and would be there when Jem waked up in the morning...""",5,Simply the best and truest  adaptation to the screen,1025136000,"06 27, 2002",2002,2308,"['read', 'two', 'books', 'summer', 'turned', 'fourteen', 'was', 'one', 'moved', 'first', 'time', 'very', 'deeply', 'haunted', 'quiet', 'unflinching', 'look', 'racism', 'seen', 'eyes', 'purest', 'children', 'identified', 'Jem', 'Scout', 'Dill', 'wished', 'could', 'go', 'heart-stopping', 'excursions', 'Boo', 'house', 'felt', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'emotion', 'classic', 'evokes', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'brought', 'screen', 'was', 'nothing', 'missing', 'complete', 'intact', 'translation', 'cinema', 'opinion', 'best', 'performance', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'career', 'hated', 'Mayella', 'Ewell', 'long', 'time', 'realized', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'truly', 'like', 'real', 'villain', 'here', 'father', 'felt', 'so', 'bad', 'Brock', 'Peters', 'felt', 'hopelessness', 'so', 'keenly', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'much', 'harder', 'was', 'read', 'pain', 'resignation', 'face', 'still', 'up', 'hate', 'crimes', 'continue', 'day', 'uncomfortably', 'truck', 'dragging', 'death', 'Texas', 'setting', 'wonderful', 'gifts', 'tree', 'Boo', 'are', 'touching', 'feeling', 'sorrow', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Radley', 'up', 'hole', 'profound', 'Dill', 'character', 'drawn', 'directly', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'old-young', 'wisdom', 'mature', 'vocabulary', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'Calpurnia', 'solid', 'comforting', 'fast-changing', 'world', 'Finch', 'household', 'are', 'glad', 'there', 'court-room', 'scene', 'riveting', 'byplay', 'balcony', 'where', 'Jem', 'Dill', 'Scout', 'sneak', 'watch', 'proceedings', 'Reverend', 'when', 'trial', 'cautions', 'children', 'Stand', 'up', 'father', 'passing..', 'so', 'thankful', 'Atticus', 'losing', 'case', 'nevertheless', 'made', 'strong', 'statement', 'virtue', 'fact', 'kept', 'jury', 'so', 'long', 'course', 'end', 'when', 'children', 'are', 'attacked', 'way', 'home', 'Halloween', 'party', 'school', 'none', 'other', 'Tom', 'Ewell', 'Boo', 'lives', 'when', 'Atticus', 'Sheriff', 'let', 'be', 'leave', 'Boo', 'alone', 'Scout', 'understand', 'would', 'be', 'killing', 'mockingbird', 'Atticus', 'up', 'night', 'Jem', 'room', 'Scout', 'Atticus', 'stayed', 'night', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'Jem', 'waked', 'up', 'morning']",N/A

The acting is superb (both Peck and the children) and the black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous.  Add to that the screenplay adapted from Lee's great novel, Bernstein's evocative score, and thoughtful directing, and it is easy to see why this is considered a timeless classic.There are those who read the book and watch the film, expecting to see a movie that is an accurate incarnation of the book, and are dissapointed.  Personally, I cannot understand this.  For the film portrays the book almost perfectly--both the events and the theme and heart of the story.  It is ridiculous to debate which work is better--they are both masterpieces of their own mediums.  Thus, it is important to look at the film without the book in mind, and if you can do this, you will undoubtedly be impressed by the beautiful film.The DVD is, for the most part, quite good.  I would support an effort at Universal to make a limited edition 2-DVD set to honor this wonderful film, but as it now stands, I am perfectly happy.

This is one of the few books I read where I really felt that I knew the characters; it was as if the town of Maycomb came alive in my head!  Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus is inspired and brilliant.  I thought Colin Wilcox was exceptional as Violet Ewell.  My favourite performer and character, however is Scout (as I'm sure author Harper Lee intended).  Mary Badham is just phenomenonal as Scout! (Badham still receives fan mail from all over the world from fans of her portrayal)  She was perfect for the role as she was a real - life Southerner and, having never acted in films before, a complete natural. I loved the character of Scout in the book and I love her in the movie. I've known and heard of girls who empathised and related to her so much that they nicknamed themselves &quot;Scout&quot;. Harper Lee must have been pleased with Mary Badham's performance which I think is a classic of it's kind. Philip Alford is almost as good as Jem; together they are quite believable as brother and sister. Here comes my one disappointment in the casting :why did they chose John Megna to play Dill?  In the book he was a towhead and not at all like the actor portraying him (he was really Truman Capote, you know)  The kids want to catch a glimpse of Boo Radley and instead they are intruded upon by a great shadow of an unknown hulk of man - it's one of the truly scary scenes. Aunt Alexandria is totally omitted from the film which I'm not sure is advantageous or not. Ruth White is great as the crotchety Mrs. Dubose, however she too, had more to do in the book, where it was revealed that she was a morphine addict. Alice Ghostley is funny as Dill's Aunt Stephanie who warns sternly about the dangers of hanging around the Radley place. Brock Peters is terrific as Tom Robinson, and Estelle Evans is wonderful as the much-loved Calpurnia. I firmly believe that the score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the most beautifully haunting of ANY score done for a film and totally appropriate to the movie.(The original AVA label soundtrack record is a much sought after collector's item).

I would say that although there are a few elements of the novel that get lost in the movie, it is still a great production regardless. That is probably why it was nominated for eight Academy Awards in 1962, including best picture, best actor (Gregory Peck), best actress in a supporting role (Mary Badham), best director (Robert Mulligan), best screenplay, best black and white cinematography, best black and white art direction and best original musical score. The movie won two of the eight awards, best art direction and best actor.The story revolves around the experiences of Scout, a little girl who is telling a story from her childhood. Her father is assigned as the defense attorney of a black young man falsely accused of raping a white girl. The movie does a good job in disseminating the book's main message: racism is destructive and has no basis to exist in our society. If you consider that the book was written in 1960, this is not a minor point, but on the contrary it is a very powerful statement. The movie also does a great job in portraying the qualities found in the character of Atticus Finch, a father who is raising two kids by himself, after losing his wife, and is doing a splendid job at it. Not only he differs from the norm at the time because he never hits his children, but he also tries not to influence their ideas of what is wrong and right. Instead of promoting hatred in Scout and Jem against the people that are racist and unfair, he tries to teach them tolerance to understand that these individuals are acting mostly out of fear. Throughout the story one can observe how the two siblings go from considering Atticus an old man who could not play football with other dads to seeing him as a hero with outstanding values.It is hard to decide how to rate a movie that is based on such an incredibly awesome book. First, because it is harder to convey the &quot;child's view&quot; in the movie while this is very clear in the book. Second because there are passages of the book that were left out, and although they are not crucial to the story they give it a certain charm (for example the visit of Jem and Scout to Calpurnia's church). Therefore, if I use the book as a benchmark, the movie should be rated four stars. However, I think it makes more sense to compare the movie with other movies, and in this comparison it is extremely clear that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is as good as it gets, consequently deserving the five stars rating.",5,In the quest to achieve an impossible feat,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,2623,"['Making', 'justice', 'film', 'best', 'novel', 'twentieth', 'century', 'determined', 'vote', 'librarians', 'US', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'few', 'elements', 'novel', 'get', 'lost', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'production', 'regardless', 'probably', 'why', 'was', 'nominated', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Awards', '1962', 'including', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'actor', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'best', 'actress', 'supporting', 'role', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'best', 'director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'best', 'screenplay', 'best', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'best', 'black', 'white', 'art', 'direction', 'best', 'original', 'musical', 'score', 'movie', 'won', 'two', 'eight', 'awards', 'best', 'art', 'direction', 'best', 'actor.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'experiences', 'Scout', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'telling', 'story', 'childhood', 'father', 'assigned', 'defense', 'attorney', 'black', 'young', 'man', 'falsely', 'accused', 'raping', 'white', 'girl', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'disseminating', 'book', 'main', 'message', 'racism', 'destructive', 'basis', 'exist', 'society', 'consider', 'book', 'was', 'written', '1960', 'not', 'minor', 'point', 'contrary', 'very', 'powerful', 'statement', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'qualities', 'found', 'character', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'father', 'who', 'raising', 'two', 'kids', 'losing', 'wife', 'doing', 'splendid', 'job', 'Not', 'only', 'norm', 'time', 'never', 'children', 'also', 'not', 'influence', 'ideas', 'what', 'wrong', 'right', 'Instead', 'promoting', 'hatred', 'Scout', 'Jem', 'people', 'are', 'racist', 'unfair', 'teach', 'tolerance', 'understand', 'individuals', 'are', 'acting', 'mostly', 'fear', 'story', 'one', 'can', 'observe', 'how', 'two', 'siblings', 'go', 'considering', 'Atticus', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'play', 'football', 'other', 'dads', 'seeing', 'hero', 'outstanding', 'values.It', 'hard', 'decide', 'how', 'rate', 'movie', 'based', 'such', 'incredibly', 'awesome', 'book', 'First', 'harder', 'convey', 'quot', 'child', 'view', 'quot', 'movie', 'very', 'clear', 'book', 'Second', 'are', 'passages', 'book', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'are', 'not', 'crucial', 'story', 'give', 'certain', 'charm', 'example', 'visit', 'Jem', 'Scout', 'Calpurnia', 'church', 'Therefore', 'use', 'book', 'benchmark', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'four', 'stars', 'However', 'think', 'more', 'sense', 'compare', 'movie', 'other', 'movies', 'comparison', 'extremely', 'clear', 'quot', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'quot', 'as', 'good', 'consequently', 'deserving', 'five', 'stars', 'rating']",N/A

The setting has a charged undercurrent of racism, which I am sure must've been very poignant during the movie's release. Yes, it's a great movie, especially on the digitally mastered DVD.But it is not the magnum opus that people never seem to get enough of raving about. Perhaps it just hasn't aged that well.The story is set in Alabama during the Great Depression. It follows the life of Scout Finch, a little girl growing up in those wretched times. Basically, it's about what's going on with the town and what's going on with Scout and her family throughout her growth, leading to different storylines of events that happens to Scout and the rest of the Finch's.Probably the only storyline I really appreciated was the story of Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus (Scout's father) was defending Tom in a rape case, and since Tom was black, this was taboo in Maycomb. This pithily showed unfairness and how cruel prejudice and hate can be. Maybe if the movie was only centered around that story instead of throwing in aspects like Boo Radley, Dill, and others, I would consider calling this movie a classic. It didn't really help that Scout, who is supposed to be an innocent unknowing little girl, actually comes off as an annoying, loud, obnoxious brat that you'd want to slap throughout the entire movie.There's some good acting  although Gregory Peck's wooden oh-so-conscientious face was nowhere near Oscar worthy, had it not been for the controversial theme.

It has become not only a tale of a single father's love for his two children but a social commentary of socialism, racism and injustice. Director Robert Mulligan delivers Lee's classic with such precision that the book translation into the film reatined it's quality with nothing lost. What other films taken from books can say that? It has made the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of top 100 films of all time. It's considered one of the finest examples of family drama ever made. Even though set in a 1932 Depression-era Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, in history it still remains timeless. It's message still remains powerfully strong and resounding in our American society today. It still defends the cause of tolerance, justice, sound morals and responsible, loving single parenthood.This message is just as very much important today as it was then. I recommend this to people of all ages. The courtroom drama is beyond mundane or formality. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two. This is one of his best performances that got him the Oscar at the Academy Awards in 1962. He takes on with compassion the defense of a black man (Brock Peters) accused of rape and murder of a young white woman. His children Scout (Mary Badham) who tells the story and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) learn about racial prejudice and hatred. They also overcome their fear of a mysterious, obscure and silent neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant screen debut). Some of the best classic lines from the movie when Atticus has a quiet moment with his children. If you just learn a single trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. And he tells them about it was a sin to kill a mockingbird. The mockingbird was different from all the other birds...because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncrib, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us.What comes from this beautifully told film is a shining, intense drama that cleverly extracts the ideas of Harper Lee's heartfelt classic, a tremendously talented group of American actors brought together in one film and the magic of devoted artistry of screenplay and an outstanding score. It's strength has survived all the madness and complexity of today's so-called Hollywood cinema.

Amazon has an odd policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions of a movie that is released on home video. So, to make the most use of the hundreds of reviews listed for TKAM, click on the ""show all reviews"" link and then sort by ""Newest First"". Then look at date of the review. Now on to my review:First off, I've always loved this film and it was the story, acting and the photography that always captured me since I saw the film when it was released. It was in black and white (and growing up we only had a black and white TV, so I was used to this). The film looked ""okay"" on VHS and then, in 1998 Universal released it on DVD in a Collector's Edition. This included the film plus a full length commentary and the (then) new feature-length documentary. This was great.. but the film had not been ""restored"".Now Universal has restored it and the print is great. They brought back the above noted bonus features and added more! The bonuses amount to more viewing time than the feature film (almost four times!). The DVD version of the new release contains all the featurettes while the Blu-ray combo pack Collectors' Edition ads the book with rare photos etc and high-def of the special features. So if you don't have a BD player yet you won't miss out on the wonderful special features. And if you have not seen the documentary before, it will blow you away. (By the way, after you've absorbed ALL the featurettes on this set, seek out the new documentary, ""Hey Boo, Harper Lee and To Kill a Mockingbird"" which I reviewed last year. Both of these DVDs belong in every home.For all the material on this marvelous set from Universal, a copy belongs in every home - especially one with pre-teen and teenage children.

The story of Finch's defense of Tom Robinson is intertwined with Scout's remembrance of growing up with her brother Jem and  friend Dill and their encounter with Boo Radley, a neighbor recluse considered by most to be insane.  Boo is played by a very young Robert Duvall in his first major (albeit small) film role.Like the book, the movie has genuine heart.

50821,AYKM1B74OLEVC,0783222955,Story Charts,"[1, 1]","To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about the idea that to grow up is to overcome prejudice. It tries to prove this idea with three plots, one of each type:-An external plot seeking justice for a wrongly convicted Tom Robinson-A relationship plot between the children and Boo Radley-An internal development plot of the children's maturationThe external plot is the main driver of the story: a black man has been falsely accused of rape by a white woman. Worse, he is wrongly convicted by a jury of white men after having the audacity to declare that he was helping the woman out of pity. This plot results in a failure as Tom is convicted and killed while trying to escape. The plot has a reversal at the end in which the true criminal (and perpetrator of prejudice) is himself killed and his killing is accepted by the law as eye-for-an-eye for Tom.The external plot unfolds in the formative years of the children and has a distinct impact on their relationship with an ostracized neighbor. They begin by fearing, judging and harassing Boo Radley, only to find that Boo has been helping them from the shadows. The plot ends when the children welcome Boo as a friend.The internal plot of the maturation of the children makes steady progress. They demonstrate an innate acceptance of others (in sharp contrast with the societal mores) and end up overcoming their own fear of Boo by accepting him as a friend (when even society has not accepted him).To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story with a great idea: that growing up means overcoming prejudice. It seems to suggest that children have innate goodness and acceptance but can be molded by grownups and society to become blinded or become mature members of society. This contrasts with the idea that prejudice in any shape or form is childish and dangerous trait in adults and society as a whole. The story makes this point by tying together the three plots at the end: Boo kills the man who embodied prejudice to bring late justice for Tom Robinson, Boo does this to save the children, and the children accept him as a friend even though society still shuns him.It's a great movie.My only beef is the children's internal arc does not have many negative turning points.

This anniversary edition is worth the investment for any movie collection.  I'm not a big blue-ray fan because I don't think they are worth the extra cost for all the hype.  For those who don't agree, we are all entitled to our opinions.  This version works for me.Gregory Peck embodies Atticus Finch and the bonus features reveal such tidbits as his meeting of Harper Lee during filming of the movie began a lifetime relationship between her and the Peck family.  Haper Lee was a notorious recluse, so this was quite an interesting bit of news.The 50th Anniversary edition includes 2 discs, one for the movie and one for the Bonus Features.  The worst of the features is &#34;The Excerpt From The Academy Tribute To Gregory Peck&#34;.  There's nothing new here.  It's appears to occur after Mr. Peck's death and when Harper Lee is introduced, the camera is blocked by people's heads.  Terrible!  Plus, all you want to do the entire time Cecelia Peck is talking is brush her hair out of her face!  So annoying!The best features are:  &#34;A Conversation With Gregory Peck&#34; and &#34;Scout Remembers&#34;.  These offer fun insights into filming and how cast members were selected.  Plus it's fun to see Scout all grown up!&#34;The American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award&#34; is only Gregory Peck's Acceptance Speech, not the entire program.  Although his speech is quite insightful as to the man, given what he chooses to talk about.&#34;Fearful Symmetry&#34; is a good look at the overall making of the film and repeats a bit of what occurs in &#34;A Conversation With Gregory Peck&#34; and &#34;Scout Remembers&#34;.&#34;100 Years of Universal: Restoring the Classics&#34; is not specific to &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#34;  It's interesting in its own right regarding the general loss of film and importance of restoration.

50850,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0783222955,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 4]","The word ""classic"" is liberally applied to just about any film that made any list or won any award over the past 100 years of cinema. It's a word that has been cheapened by its overuse in marketing. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" defines the word classic. It's not because of the top notch production although that's part of it. This film belongs to an era when craftsmanship was an important part of storytelling. In our world of rapid fire cutting where bodies pile up faster than the credits pass by, we've lost touch with the sensibility that informs this classic film. Robert Mulligan's sensitive direction, Gregory Peck's iconographic performance and a literate, intelligent script by Horton Foote (""Lonesome Dove"") that doesn't pander to the audience makes ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" one of those rare films that deserve the term classic and also deserves to be  on every best list for films made during the 20th century.Based on Harper Lee's popular novel, ""Mockingbird"" tells the story of widower Atticas Finch (Peck) a small town  southern attorney who tackles the difficult defense of African American Tom Robinson (the late Brock peters) accused of raping the Caucasian daughter of a racist father (James Anderson). The film doesn't just focus on the rape trial though as it also chronicles the little things in Atticas' life that go right and wrong; his daughter Scout (Mary Badham) faces criticism at school for defending an African American and also her shift from tomboy to young lady. She and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) tell tales of the local bogeyman Boo (Robert Duvall)who lives down the lane and sharing their views on the adult world that passes them by. The film is informed with the southern atmosphere but ironically was shot entirely on Universal's backlot in Southern California. It would have been very easy to portray Atticas as a paragon of virtue. He's well meaning but just as flawed as everybody else in the town and that includes missing cues during the trial that could prove Tom's innocence early on. The fact that everyone-from the children to the adults-all treated with respect as to their view of the world makes ""Mockingbird"" an enduring classic that aged incredibly well. Like the best wines the rich themes in this film continue to resonate and intoxicate an audience nearly fifty years after the film was made. That's a testament to great filmmaking. While director Mulligan and producer Pakula would make a number of other notable and powerful films, this is the first pillar in their long careers and because of its strength the rest of their best films could be made.Universal has taken a lot hard knocks lately about the quality of their DVD releases and lack of extras. They should also be recognized for the exceptional job they've done with this re-release. The black and white images are truly startling with rich fine detail, an exceptional gray scale and sharp image quality. The soundtrack is equally good with a top notch 5.1 new transfer as well as the original 2.0 mono soundtrack..The features on disc one include Peck's acceptance speech for his Academy Award for the role of Finch, Peck's remarks at the American Film Institute Award ceremony honoring him. There's also an excerpt from the Academy tribute to Peck with Cecilia Peck remarking on the passing of her father. Finally there's ""Scott Remembers"" an interview with Mary Badham about working with Peck as a child actor.The second disc features the bulk of the extras with two marvelous documentaries one of them brand new to this edition. ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"" directed by Barbara Kopple and produced by Peck's daughter isn't the usual intimate one-on-one chats were used to seeing. Instead, Kopple films an appearance by Peck in Boston to discuss his work as an opportunity to look at his life and career. Peck comes across with his usual sense of sincerity and is engaging. The documentary ""Fearful Symmetry"" about the making of the film was available on the previous DVD. Director Charles Kiselyak interviews everyone from director Mulligan to the now adult child actors that appeared in the film discussing not only Lee's world but how it was reflective of the world they grew up and lived in when the film was made. Interweaving that footage with location interviews with the people of the town that Lee wrote about in the book (where she herself grew up) , it's a fascinating glimpse into the fantasy vs. reality of Lee's world and how they intersect. We also get reproductions of the original posters for the film as part of the package from its exhibition around the world. Universal has done a truly spectacular job with this re-release to commemorate this classic film.Luckily Mulligan and Pakula (both now deceased) did a commentary for an earlier edition of the film. That commentary appears yet again on this edition. While there's long passages of silence, that's OK; neither man blabbers on instead making very focused precise comments about the making of the film and their intent.A truly outstanding release from Universal, I'd highly recommend ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" for purchase. If you have the earlier edition, this edition does offer the advantage of a new documentary, the lobby cards as well as a brilliant transfer of the classic film while retaining most of the extras from the previous edition. It's well worth visting with Atticas Finch and his family again.",5,Peck's finest performance in a role that fits him like a suit,1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,5414,"['word', 'classic', 'liberally',

Just about everything worked. Wonderful book by Harper Lee, strong adaptation by Horton Foote, perfect casting, starting with Gregory Peck, understated directing by Pakula, mesmerising music by Elmer Bernstein.The film itself never looked or sounded better than on this DVD. I have not tried some of the other releases to compare.  But the extras are just minimum.  The conversation with Gregory Peck? It is more of a home movie than an interview. You see him talk about his work for a total of less than 10 minutes. The rest of the time you see him with a lot of other people (presumably his family but the credits do not say), eating figs, just hanging out. I was hoping to hear him talk about his role and what he thought it meant.  Anyone else in the film?  Forget about them. Scout is the only other person involved that you see, and that was a wonderful extra.  You see Foote for maybe a minute and the great Elmer Bernstein for a total of 30 seconds.Come on Hollywood, this is one of the best films ever made, you can give us more than this.  We get more extras than this for any Batman or Halloween picture.If I had it to do over, I would probably just hang on to my VHS and wait until somebody did this right.Or if they released this DVD at less than a premium price.

It is a stunning film, a fable of fear and prejudice told with striking visual flair. The haunting shadows and eerie hues of Russell Harlan's camerawork evoke the myths and nocturnal fears of childhood, and Elmer Bernstein's quintessentially American score supplements the imagery well, creating a film laden with atmosphere.Harper Lee's story follows a lawyer (Atticus Finch) who puts himself on the line to defend a black man accused of rape in the 1930s deep south, told through the eyes of his two children, who are on a journey of their own to overcome some lesser prejudices of their own. The young Mary Badham and Philip Alford give excellent performances.The subject matter is bold for the time, and there is little evidence of the kind of bowdlerization that plagued many other films of the same, and an earlier, era. The heart of the film is very simple: It wants very earnestly to show us that prejudice and bigotry are nothing but those childhood fears, borne of ignorance, and resolved by those brave enough to step beyond the barriers, confronting their fears, and, in so doing, finding that differences are nothing to be scared of.",5,Beautiful in every way,1048377600,"03 23, 2003",2003,1265,"['Robert', 'Mulligan', 'hardly', 'directed', 'films', 'note', 'what', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'stunning', 'film', 'fable', 'fear', 'prejudice', 'told', 'striking', 'visual', 'flair', 'haunting', 'shadows', 'eerie', 'hues', 'Russell', 'Harlan', 'camerawork', 'evoke', 'myths', 'nocturnal', 'fears', 'childhood', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'quintessentially', 'American', 'score', 'supplements', 'imagery', 'well', 'creating', 'film', 'laden', 'atmosphere.Harper', 'Lee', 'story', 'lawyer', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'who', 'line', 'defend', 'black', 'man', 'accused', 'rape', '1930s', 'deep', 'south', 'told', 'eyes', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'journey', 'own', 'overcome', 'lesser', 'prejudices', 'own', 'young', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'Philip', 'Alford', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'bold', 'time', 'little', 'evidence', 'kind', 'bowdlerization', 'plagued', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'earlier', 'era', 'heart', 'film', 'very', 'simple', 'very', 'earnestly', 'show', 'prejudice', 'bigotry', 'are', 'nothing', 'childhood', 'fears', 'borne', 'ignorance', 'resolved', 'brave', 'enough', 'step', 'barriers', 'confronting', 'fears', 'so', 'doing', 'finding', 'differences', 'are', 'nothing', 'be', 'scared']",N/A

The movie carries all of the impact of the book, with a perfect cast bringing to life the familiar characters.  Scout, Atticus Finch and Boo Radley all come to life in crisp black and white.Challenging subject matter in it's time, the themes are still valid today.  Rape, racism...not easy topics to discuss especially for kids, but they are facts of the world and should be confronted.  This movie, and the book it comes from, help ease the transition.The DVD is excellent, and a great presentation for this fine film.  Definitely one for the ages.

Gregory Peck plays the #1 hero of all time, Atticus Finch, who is on a mission to do what is right whatever the costs may be. He faces many hindrances along the way, but takes them like a man and refuses to give up. By defending a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of rape, he does what no other attorney in Maycomb has the courage to do. Atticus' acts also have a deep effect on his children, Jem and Scout who remember his incrdible bravery forever. I love how this film shows that people don't have to succeed to be heroes. Good things can come from the effort, too.You are crazy if you do not at least like this film. It is an American classic that cannot be forgotten.",5,Gregory Peck shines!,1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,754,"['movie', 'truth', 'life', 'unfair', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'Gregory', 'Peck', '1', 'hero', 'time', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'who', 'mission', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'costs', 'may', 'be', 'many', 'hindrances', 'way', 'man', 'give', 'up', 'defending', 'black', 'man', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'rape', 'what', 'other', 'attorney', 'Maycomb', 'courage', 'do', 'Atticus', 'acts', 'also', 'have', 'deep', 'effect', 'children', 'Jem', 'Scout', 'who', 'remember', 'incrdible', 'bravery', 'forever', 'love', 'how', 'film', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'succeed', 'be', 'heroes', 'Good', 'things', 'can', 'come', 'effort', 'are', 'crazy', 'do', 'not', 'least', 'film', 'American', 'classic', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A
