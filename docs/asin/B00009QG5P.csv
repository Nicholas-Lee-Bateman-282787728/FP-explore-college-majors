New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and to reach a wider audience. Her books were written in the late 1930s from personal experiences that no historian can match. Laura lost her savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depression of their era are referenced implicitly. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura would have censored events that were not suitable for children's books. Here are the titles of the twenty-two shows.Disc 1.The Richest Man in Walnut Grove.  Four Eyes.Haunted House.  In the Big Inning.Disc 2.The Campout.  The Spring Dance.Remember Me - Part 1.  Remember Me - Part 2.Disc 3.Ebenezer Sprague.  At the End of the Rainbow.The Gift.

756931,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B00009QG5P,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[0, 0]","Little House on the Prairie continued its excellence in season two, and while there are still some problems with this set (which I'll get to later) it's still definitely worth purchasing.There are in all twenty one episodes in this set, and they are all excellent. Some of my favorites had to deal with problems with the Ingalls children like in ""Four Eyes"" where Mary finds out she needs glasses, and the hilarious episode where Laura and her friend find ""gold"" in ""At the End of the Rainbow."" In extremely sad episode from season two is ""Remember Me"" where the Ingalls's neighbor, a widow named Julia Sanderson discovers she does not have long to live and asks Charles to find a good home for her children, in fact this episode is one of the most heartbreaking from the whole series. But don't worry; there are some less serious episode like ""In the Big Inning"", ""The Gift"" and ""the Spring Dance."" But each episode from this season is fantastic, I think Little House is special because every episode is a must have for any collector, they're all absolutely fantastic.We get more of the same (which is a good thing) in the packaging department for season two's collector's edition release, there are some nice photos of Melissa Gilbert and Melissa Anderson, and Michael Landon and the photos for the disc are nice as well. There also is a pamphlet which includes every episode synopsis for season two. We also get more of the same, (which is a bad thing) the only bonus feature is a photo album (not very impressive) a Little House quiz which frankly is a tacky add on and character profiles. Another complaint (although small) is the quality of the picture in season two, it has been improved slightly it still has its problems. But put that aside and this set is a very good buy.Well I've said about all I can say, a little more effort and this set would be fantastic but hey, who wants to miss out on one of the best television series of all time?",4,Little House on the Prairie - Season Two,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,1951,"['Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'continued', 'excellence', 'season', 'two', 'are', 'still', 'problems', 'set', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later', 'still', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchasing.There', 'are', 'twenty', 'one', 'set', 'are', 'excellent', 'favorites', 'had', 'deal', 'problems', 'Ingalls', 'children', 'Four', 'Eyes', 'where', 'Mary', 'out', 'glasses', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'where', 'Laura', 'friend', 'find', 'gold', 'End', 'Rainbow', 'extremely', 'sad', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'Remember', 'Me', 'where', 'Ingalls', 'neighbor', 'widow', 'named', 'Julia', 'Sanderson', 'not', 'have', 'long', 'live', 'Charles', 'find', 'good', 'home', 'children', 'fact', 'episode', 'one', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'whole', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'are', 'less', 'serious', 'episode', 'Big', 'Inning', 'Gift', 'Spring', 'Dance', 'episode', 'season', 'fantastic', 'think', 'Little', 'House', 'special', 'episode', 'must', 'have', 'collector', ""'re"", 'absolutely', 'fantastic.We', 'get', 'more', 'same', 'good', 'thing', 'packaging', 'department', 'season', 'two', 'collector', 'edition', 'release', 'are', 'nice', 'photos', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'Melissa', 'Anderson', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'photos', 'disc', 'are', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'pamphlet', 'episode', 'synopsis', 'season', 'two', 'also', 'get', 'more', 'same', 'bad', 'thing', 'only', 'bonus', 'feature', 'photo', 'album', 'not', 'very', 'impressive', 'Little', 'House', 'quiz', 'frankly', 'tacky', 'add', 'character', 'profiles', 'complaint', 'small', 'quality', 'picture', 'season', 'two', 'been', 'improved', 'slightly', 'still', 'problems', 'put', 'aside', 'set', 'very', 'good', 'buy.Well', ""'ve"", 'said', 'can', 'say', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'fantastic', 'hey', 'who', 'miss', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'time']",N/A

I have purchased season sets of both versions and they have some disks with people who don't belong on disks. I believe only regulars should be on the disks, meaning The Ingalls family, the townsfolk, the Edward's, and in later seasons the Garveys. And only in seasons where they are on and a regular. One of the disks in this season and version has Jonathan Garvey. Jonathan Garvey is not on until the 1st episode of the 4th season. On the first season of this version has ErnestBorgnine. He was only on 2 episodes and should not have been on a disk. In the other version ""fold out"" has the same problem too. In Season 4 disks has one for ""Toby Noe"" who doesn't come until the 5th season and then he still doesn't belong on a disk. The 6th season has one for Reverend Aldens wife who does not belong on a disk. Season 7 and 8 disks are great, only regulars. I don't have Season 9 and the Movies so I can't comment on those. This season's cover doesn't belong. Bandit and Baby Grace don't come until the 4th Season. The people might be rearranged, but it is the same cover as Season 4 ""fold out"" version. Season 1 of this version's disks everyone is too old for that season.

There were Indians and hardships of every kind, and the emphasis was on the family&#8217;s journey and settlement. The popular series ran for nine seasons, but by Season 2 the plots were already shifting from pioneer-specific storylines to ones that viewers may have seen elsewhere and could actually identify with better.  Mary struggles with wearing glasses, faces the responsibility of buying a gift for the reverend, and becomes a local hero when she qualifies for a state math competition. Laura finds her feud with &#34;frenemy&#34; Nellie Olsen accelerating, and the families are thrown together this season on a camping trip to gather leaves for a school project.

It is a wonderful series for children and adults alike.  I'm so glad they are on DVD to share with my children.  This is a 6 disc set that includes:Disc 1THE RICHEST MAN IN WALNUT GROVE: After the mill closes, Charles is unable to pay off his debt at the mercantile.  He must take on several jobs at once.  Mary goes to work to help the family, while Laura does extra chores at home.  When the bill finally gets paid, Nels tells Charles that with a loving family like his, he is certainly the richest man in Walnut Grove.FOUR EYES: Mary is beginning to have difficulty at school because she can't read the blackboard.  She really likes her new glasses until the other children tease her about wearing them.  She arranges to lose them hoping she won't have to wear them anymore, but changes her mind when she realizes that her teacher, who also wears glasses, has a boyfriend.HAUNTED HOUSE: Nellie dares Laura to enter a haunted house.  Once inside, Laura meets Mr. Pike the owner, who tells her he is waiting for his wife to return.  Laura learns that she passed away several years before.  The two become friends as Laura helps Mr. Pike deal with his loss.IN THE BIG INNING: It's time for baseball!  After losing badly the previous year, all of Walnut Grove expects to win the upcoming game thanks to their star pitcher, Mr. Mumford.  The population is so confident, that they even place bets on the game.  It looks like their hopes will be dashed when Mrs. Mumford refuses to permit her husband to play because she does not approve of gambling.  Caorline saves the day by suggesting that any money raised from the game be donated to the church.Disc 2THE CAMPOUT: Mrs. Oleson wants to prevent the Ingalls children from outdoing her children on a leaf-gathering pfoject, thus her family accompanies the Ingalls on their camping trip.  The Oleson's manage to get into trouble out in the woods, causing all the campers to have a misearable time.THE SPRING DANCE: Laura and Grace Snider are both trying very hard to get asked to the spring dance.  Unfortunately, the young men they are interested in don't seem to want to go.

After Julia passes away, Charles has difficulty finding someone who will take all three of them.  Just as he reluctantly decides that he must separate the children, Mr. Edwards and Grace get married and adopt the three orphans.Disc 3EBENEZER SPRAGUE: Charles and Hansen build a bank in Walnut Grove.  The banker is Mr. Sprague, a cold and heartless man.  Not realizing who he is, Laura becomes friends with him.  Suspicious, the banker accuses Laura of acting on behalf of her father who must certainly want a loan.AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW: While fishing, Laura and a friend stumble upon some ""gold"".  They spend several weeks trying to pull all of the gold from the stream.  It is only when they bring it to the bank, that they learn it is fool's gold.THE GIFT: The school children have saved up their money to buy the Reverend a birthday present.  They give the money to Mary, who is in charge of purchasing just the right gift.  Laura convinces Mary to buy something that they could sell to people with the hope that they could buy Reverend Alden an even better gift.  The plan backfires when they are unable to sell anything.  Mary and Laura explain to the Reverend what they did.  On Sunday, Reverend Alden thanks the children for buying a wooden box that he could put his old Bible in.HIS FATHER'S SON: Mr. and Mrs. Edwards adopt John Anderson.  John is a lot more interested in books than farming or hunting.  Mr. Edwars would like him to consider other activities and buys him a gun for his birthday.

756942,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00009QG5P,JGC,"[2, 2]","Season 2 of ""Little House on the Prairie"" has always been one of my very favorites of the entire series because it includes so many heartfelt episodes that your entire family can appreciate. All of the actors, from the show's producer/director/star, Michael Landon to Melissa Gilbert (who played the lead role, Laura Ingalls Wilder, based on her children's books) are exceptional.Included in this set is a total of 6 discs which includes a total of 22 eps. And this is in digipack which I personally prefer just because it looks nicer and is easer to get in an out of. In keeping with the spirit of the series, all of the shows have a wonderful message that are timeless and life affirming. One of my favorite eps is ""Troublemaker."" In this show, Laura becomes the target of a ruthless new teacher, hired to take over for Miss Beadle. So, as usual, it's Charles to the rescue, once again.In season 6 Melissa Anderson really started to become a breakout star. Mary was the complete opposite to Laura, but so many people could relate to her because Ms. Anderson was able to put so much life and vitality into this role. And I feel that it was certainly a prelude to future seasons when so much tragedy and drama struck poor Mary.""Little House"" was recently pulled off Hallmark to make room for Martha Stewart's 7-hour a day daily-marathons which left a lot of longtime viewers of this classic, wholesome, family-friendly series very disappointed because no other show on TV currently captures the magic that ""Little House"" always did. If you feel like me I recommend getting these DVDs. It's a great way to reintroduce yourself to this classic show.Michael Landon set such high standards and goals that no other television program has every been able to match the type of sentiment and emotion that ""Little House"" always attained.

This is NOT the same pitiful DVD collection that fans put up with for years. This is remastering the way it was meant to be done. The opening theme has been restored (it was left out the other time) and from what I've watched, the episodes are back to their normal length.  Outside scenes especially look very vivid and fresh as though they were filmed just yesterday. Even far away shots aren't as grainy and unclear as they were the other times I've watched them. As a side note, I just compared the remastered version to the original DVDs. There is NO comparison. Volume is terrific and even with its basic 2.0 sound, the music and dialog come through quite easily. As far as the casing is concerned, I doubt you'll need to worry about any scratched discs as they are all firmly attached to their cradles.Many (including myself) put up with the inferior previous release with little hope of actually watching this classic the way it was meant to be watched. I can say with conviction that this is no longer the case. The only thing I would have liked better is if they included more bonus features. But even then, just having the show look this great is in many ways a bonus enough.Buy this collection. Ignore the fact that you invested a couple hundred dollars with the previous releases.

My oldest daughter (currently age 12) and I have been reading the Little House series books since she was a baby. We started with the board books and moved through the various versions until we started the chapter books. We're still reading the chapter books but she's finally outgrowing them (Harry Potter moved in a few years ago and more recently it was The Hunger Games series, and the list will go on). We still read from the books but it's been nice to finally introduce the television series that I grew up with to her. I now have a 10 month old baby girl and I'm already reading the Little House board books to her so it will be fun to start the experience all over again. I'm loving the Blu-Rays. The quality is incredible and the price is hard to beat! We pre-ordered ours and paid $17.96 here on Amazon. How could you go wrong? (In comparison I've been paying anywhere between $40-$65 per season for the Doctor Who blu-ray sets!) This review is for season one and two. I'm hoping (praying!) for the studio to release the remaining seasons. I'm urging the fans to go out and buy the sets so we can send a message to the studio that we want the remastered product and are willing to pay for it.

It also sends out worthy messages of family importance, loving your neighbor, working hard at whatever you do without sounding preachy.Definitely worthy to add to your collection!",5,Worthy Addition to Anyone's Collection,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,2022,"['now', 'second', 'season', 'Little', 'House', 'was', 'hitting', 'stride', 'show', 'most', 'classic', 'episodes', 'are', 'featured', 'here', 'set', 'including', 'Richest', 'Man', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'showing', 'Ingalls', 'family', 'all', 'pulling', 'together', 'order', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'Oleson', 'Mercantile', 'showing', 'Mrs.', 'Oleson', 'witchy', 'best', 'Four', 'Eyes', 'episode', 'Mary', 'first', 'pair', 'eyeglasses', 'Campout', 'Oleson', 'family', 'Ingalls', 'camping', 'trip', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'Laura', 'Nellie', 'go', 'down', 'rapids', 'Nellie', 'Willie', 'Mrs.', 'Oleson', 'end', 'up', 'poison', 'ivy', 'Remember', 'Me', 'Mr.', 'Edwards', 'not', 'only', 'Widow', 'Snyder', 'deceased', 'Mrs.', 'Sanderson', 'three', 'children', 'Ebeneezer', 'Sprague', 'where', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'first', 'only', 'bank', 'Talking', 'Machine', 'where', 'nasty', 'Nellie', 'Oleson', 'Laura', 'front', 'crush', 'Jason', 'Matter', 'Faith', 'episode', 'Caroline', 'nearly', 'infection', 'Charles', 'girls', 'are', 'overnight', 'trip', 'Troublemaker', 'where', 'Miss', 'Beadle', 'replaced', 'stern', 'Mr.', 'Applewood', 'who', 'Laura', 'My', 'Lady', 'Charles', 'few', 'white', 'lies', 'Caroline', 'order', 'buy', 'fancy', 'new', 'china', 'only', 'episode', 'where', 'Caroline', 'seriously', 'Charles', 'may', 'be', 'cheating', 'Centennial', 'where', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'celebrates', 'Ingalls', 'Olesons', 'are', 'pitted', 'other', 'many', 'competitions', 'Soldier', 'Return', 'dealing', 'morphine', 'addiction', 'Going', 'Home', 'where', 'tornado', 'down', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'first', 'several', 'Ingalls', 'crops', 'Charles', 'plans', 'take', 'family', 'back', 'home', 'Wisconsin.This', 'series', 'just', 'not', 'disappoint', 'feel', 'good', 'show', 'appropriate', 'entire', 'family', 'pleasantly', 'childhood', 'also', 'out', 'worthy', 'messages', 'family', 'importance', 'loving', 'neighbor', 'working', 'hard', 'do', 'sounding', 'preachy.Definitely', 'worthy', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
