Burchfield,"[2, 7]","For an action/adventure series Alias is one of the best & 3rd season continues with great location/set work and some good ideas.2nd season ended with Sydney awakening in a Hong Kong alley after the attack in her home and learning that she's lost two years of her life and Vaughn has long since married another woman.As the season runs along we learn more about what happened to her and the rest of the former SD-6 crowd (Marshall Finkmann is now the CIA gadget guy- sort of believable while Dixon is CIA section chief- too high a post for a former suspect, unbelievable). Her SD-6 boss, Sloane, is now the head of an international charity, never sure where his loyalties lie or what his motives are (very confusing)while Irina Derevko has disappeared (Lean Olin wouldn't come back to the show)her replacement- a younger sister played by Isabella Rosselini (she's good but looks nothing like Olin,this subplot wasn't very well handled).Along the way we see some good stories, great location work ( I like the way the show creators go to the trouble of casting extras who look like someone from the country a set is supposed to be in)lots of twists and turns including the new enemy, something called ""The Covenant"" and the fact that Vaughn's wife is a double agent for them. Sydney's discovery of a sister near season's end was a real twist, I'm waiting to see how the writers develop that one and the renewed Rambaldi subplot.The series is well worth watching and owning, I just hope that somebody gets around to tying together all the loose threads left hanging everywhere.",3,"One of the best shows on television, does need some work",1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,1574,"['action/adventure', 'series', 'Alias', 'one', 'best', '3rd', 'season', 'great', 'location/set', 'work', 'good', 'ideas.2nd', 'season', 'ended', 'Sydney', 'awakening', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'alley', 'attack', 'home', 'learning', 'lost', 'two', 'years', 'life', 'Vaughn', 'long', 'married', 'woman.As', 'season', 'learn', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'rest', 'former', 'SD-6', 'crowd', 'Marshall', 'Finkmann', 'now', 'CIA', 'gadget', 'guy-', 'sort', 'believable', 'Dixon', 'CIA', 'section', 'chief-', 'too', 'high', 'post', 'former', 'suspect', 'unbelievable', 'SD-6', 'boss', 'Sloane', 'now', 'head', 'international', 'charity', 'never', 'sure', 'where', 'loyalties', 'lie', 'what', 'motives', 'are', 'very', 'confusing', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'disappeared', 'Lean', 'Olin', 'would', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'show', 'replacement-', 'younger', 'sister', 'played', 'Isabella', 'Rosselini', 'good', 'nothing', 'Olin', 'subplot', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'handled', 'way', 'see', 'good', 'stories', 'great', 'location', 'work', 'like', 'way', 'show', 'creators', 'go', 'trouble', 'casting', 'extras', 'who', 'look', 'someone', 'country', 'set', 'supposed', 'be', 'lots', 'twists', 'including', 'new', 'enemy', 'something', 'called', 'Covenant', 'fact', 'Vaughn', 'wife', 'double', 'agent', 'Sydney', 'discovery', 'sister', 'season', 'end', 'was', 'real', 'twist', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'writers', 'develop', 'one', 'renewed', 'Rambaldi', 'subplot.The', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning', 'just', 'hope', 'somebody', 'around', 'tying', 'together', 'loose', 'threads', 'left', 'hanging', 'everywhere']",Alias - The Complete Third Season

That's Season 3 in a nutshell.  While it doesn't nearly live up to the glory of Seasons 1 and 2 (wherefore art thou, Lena ???), its still pretty darn good.  How could it not be ?Sydney has new and exciting personal challenges - such as Vaughn's wife, not to mention missions.  As a mystery woman, Lauren is hardly a replacement for Syd's missing mom.  But on that front we do meet Syd's aunt and sister during S3.  Sloan is as creepy as ever.  Marshall is as zany as ever.  Jack is full of surprises and its great to see more of Weiss this season.For the Alias faithful, there's plenty of plot twists and disguises - including one with Syd taking her turn as Marshall.  Extras are fairly standard faire, including comentaries, gag reel, and deleted scenes.  There is also a brief ""animated Alias"" which is unique, in its own way.

807238,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0001I55ZQ,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 5]","Two years have passed for Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) since her fight with Allison Doren (Merrin Dungey).  A lot has happened... and she doesn't remember a thing.  Syd wakes up to find Dixon (Carl Lumley) as the head of CIA brach she worked for, Weiss (Greg Grunberg) is now a major player, her friend Will (Bradley Cooper) is now in Witness Protection, Jack (Victor Garber), her father, is now in prison for collaborating with her mother, Irina Direvko (Lena Olin), an enemy of the state who is still missing, Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), Syd's old nemesis, is now a philanthropist/humanitarian, and her old boyfriend Vaughn (Michael Vartan) is no longer with the CIA and is married to Lauren Reed (Melissa George), and member of the National Security Council (NSC).  And that's all in the first two episodes.  The first half of the season revolves around Syd trying to learn about her missing two years through a variety of leads, all of which tend to come to dead ends.  One of the more interesting (read bizzare) episodes involves a drugged-out doctor and his equally spacy assistant who specialize in neuro recovery research.  At the same time, Syd learns that she killed a Russian diplomat while she was gone, and it turns out that the man was Mr. Sark's (David Anders) father, and with Sark's new inheritance, he joins a new terrorist group known as The Covenant.  The Covenant is a group of Russians who are trying to bring about the fulfillment Rambaldi's prophecies.  Eventually, Director Kendall (Terry O'Quinn) returns to fill Syd in on the past.The next half of the season involves the search for ""The Passenger"", another key player in Rambaldi's prophecies.  The CIA wants to find them in order to prevent The Covenant from using the Passenger to bring about destruction.  However, unbeknownst to the CIA, the Covenant has a mole in the LA branch that Syd works in.This season, much like 24's third season, is not as good as the preceding two.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very good television show, and it was much better than the majority of programming that was on at the same time, it just doesn't stand up to the amazing second season.  There was a little too much melodrama and not enough actual drama.  Also, a lot of the characters were present even when they weren't needed.  The biggest offender was Carrie (Amanda Foreman) whose only purpose was to be there as Marshall's (Kevin Wiessman) girlfriend/wife.  Sark was a regular, but he was not needed in every episode (even though I think Sark is an awesome character, I think that it's better that he's only going to be a recurring character next year).  Finally, there is Weiss.  He was used a lot at the beginning (it seemed as if he was going to be a new love interest for Syd at the beginning), then his use dropped off a little, then he came back again towards the end.  I must say that I like Weiss, and it seems like he's the character who tends to get the short end of the stick (like Lorne in Angel or Xander in the last two seasons of Buffy).  He is a bit of a ""punching bag"" and is vastly overlooked by writers and fans.All in all though, this is still good TV despite not being quite up to Alias standards.

807239,A34FV327JWDP7Y,B0001I55ZQ,"BATRON ""RON KRETSCHMER""","[6, 7]","The second season of Alias ended with the show's best fight scene to date and one of television's most jaw dropping cliffhangers of all time.  Unfortunately, the shocking finale caused the writers to spend much of the next season cleaning up fallout from that surprise, and many of the loyal viewers didn't think it was on the same level with the first two seasons.  A lot of people didn't accept Melissa George as Michael Vaughn's new wife, didn't like the idea of Arvin Sloane being a benevelont and benign humanitarian and spent the entire season pining away for the return of Lena Olin as Sydney's mother.  While they were complaining they missed some compelling relationships, more shocking surprises and the addition of Sydney's sister and a second Direvko sybling.  The acting is as first class as the previous years, the dialogue is extremely sharp and the plot twists are still crisp enough to keep up the espionage show's vaunted reputation.  The Alias DVDs are never loaded with too many extras, but the animated episode [""Tribunal""] is exceptional.  If there is a true dissapointment to season 3, it is the confusing final scene that serves as the cliff hanger.  Compared to the fantastic climaxes to each of the other four seasons, this one is a vague snoozer that fails to raise any real excitement for the next episode.  None the less, this season is still not as bad as a lot of devoted viewers make it sound and is a must own if you're at all a fan of the show or Jennifer Garner.",5,SEASON 2 CLIFFHANGER MAKES SEASON 3 TOUGH,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,1497,"['second', 'season', 'Alias', 'ended', 'show', 'best', 'fight', 'scene', 'date', 'one', 'television', 'most', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'cliffhangers', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'shocking', 'finale', 'caused', 'writers', 'spend', 'much', 'next', 'season', 'cleaning', 'up', 'fallout', 'surprise', 'many', 'loyal', 'viewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'same', 'level', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'accept', 'Melissa', 'George', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'new', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'idea', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'being', 'benevelont', 'benign', 'humanitarian', 'spent', 'entire', 'season', 'pining', 'away', 'return', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Sydney', 'mother', 'were', 'complaining', 'missed', 'compelling', 'relationships', 'more', 'shocking', 'surprises', 'addition', 'Sydney', 'sister', 'second', 'Direvko', 'sybling', 'acting', 'first', 'class', 'previous', 'years', 'dialogue', 'extremely', 'sharp', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'still', 'crisp', 'enough', 'keep', 'up', 'espionage', 'show', 'vaunted', 'reputation', 'Alias', 'DVDs', 'are', 'never', 'loaded', 'too', 'many', 'extras', 'animated', 'episode', 'Tribunal', ']', 'exceptional', 'true', 'dissapointment', 'season', '3', 'confusing', 'final', 'scene', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'Compared', 'fantastic', 'climaxes', 'other', 'four', 'seasons', 'one', 'vague', 'snoozer', 'raise', 'real', 'excitement', 'next', 'episode', 'None', 'less', 'season', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'lot', 'devoted', 'viewers', 'make', 'sound', 'must', 'own', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'Jennifer', 'Garner']",Alias - The Complete Third Season

The show combines the fast pace action sequences of 24 with the conspiracy theory backdrop of the X-Files. It also doesn't hurt that the show centers itself around a character that's a beautiful and mysterious woman. But the true strength of Alias, as with most successful TV shows, is its unique and creative writers who manage to always keep their audience on edge...Jennifer Garner (star of 13 Going On Thirty) plays the role of Sydney Anne Bristow, a beautiful, intelligent American woman recruited to work for the government's super secret SD-6 agency. However, problems arise when her fianc&eacute; is murdered by the agency she works for, and she ultimately discovers that SD-6 is not a legitimate government organization at all... In seek of revenge, Sydney contacts the CIA, and they deploy her as a double agent. Meanwhile, Sydney's estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber), also works as a double agent, and their relationship blossoms as a result of their work. Together, they manage to eliminate SD-6, and now both work full-time for the CIA where they're accompanied by fellow colleagues Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan)...The Alias (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Two"" in which Sydney, suffering from amnesia, desperately tries to uncover the truth about the past few years of her life. Meanwhile, the CIA puts her on a case which might possibly aid in her memory's recovery... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Reunion"" in which Sydney and Michael once again pair up on an assignment in order to halt an evil plot by Sark, and ""Conscious"" in which Sydney participates in a strange doctor's experiment to recover her earlier memories...Below is a list of episodes included on the Alias (Season 3) DVD:Episode 45 (The Two)Episode 46 (Succession)Episode 47 (Reunion)Episode 48 (Missing Link)Episode 49 (Repercussions)Episode 50 (The Nemesis)Episode 51 (Prelude)Episode 52 (Breaking Point)Episode 53 (Conscious)Episode 54 (Remnants)Episode 55 (Full Disclosure)Episode 56 (Crossings)Episode 57 (After Six)Episode 58 (Blowback)Episode 59 (Facade)Episode 60 (Taken)Episode 61 (The Frame)Episode 62 (Unveiled)Episode 63 (Hourglass)Episode 64 (Blood Ties)Episode 65 (Legacy)Episode 66 (Resurrection)The DVD Report",5,"Not as good as the first two seasons, but still worth it...",1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2454,"['Premiering', 'September', '2001', 'Alias', 'built', 'steady', 'loyal', 'following', 'television', 'viewers', 'show', 'fast', 'pace', 'action', 'sequences', '24', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'backdrop', 'X-Files', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'show', 'character', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'true', 'strength', 'Alias', 'most', 'successful', 'TV', 'shows', 'unique', 'creative', 'writers', 'who', 'manage', 'always', 'keep', 'audience', 'edge', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'star', '13', 'Going', 'Thirty', 'role', 'Sydney', 'Anne', 'Bristow', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'American', 'woman', 'recruited', 'work', 'government', 'super', 'secret', 'SD-6', 'agency', 'However', 'problems', 'arise', 'when', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'murdered', 'agency', 'ultimately', 'SD-6', 'not', 'legitimate', 'government', 'organization', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Sydney', 'CIA', 'deploy', 'double', 'agent', 'Meanwhile', 'Sydney', 'estranged', 'father', 'Jack', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'also', 'double', 'agent', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'result', 'work', 'Together', 'manage', 'eliminate', 'SD-6', 'now', 'work', 'full-time', 'CIA', 'where', ""'re"", 'accompanied', 'fellow', 'colleagues', 'Marshall', 'Flinkman', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'Marcus', 'Dixon', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'Alias', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Two', 'Sydney', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'desperately', 'uncover', 'truth', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'life', 'Meanwhile', 'CIA', 'case', 'might', 'possibly', 'aid', 'memory', 'recovery', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Reunion', 'Sydney', 'Michael', 'once', 'again', 'pair', 'up', 'assignment', 'order', 'halt', 'evil', 'plot', 'Sark', 'Conscious', 'Sydney', 'strange', 'doctor', 'experiment', 'recover', 'earlier', 'memories', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Alias', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '45', 'Two', 'Episode', '46', 'Succession', 'Episode', '47', 'Reunion', 'Episode', '48', 'Missing', 'Link', 'Episode', '49', 'Repercussions', 'Episode', '50', 'Nemesis', 'Episode', '51', 'Prelude', 'Episode', '52', 'Breaking', 'Point', 'Episode', '53', 'Conscious', 'Episode', '54', 'Remnants', 'Episode', '55', 'Full', 'Disclosure', 'Episode', '56', 'Crossings', 'Episode', '57', 'Six', 'Episode', '58', 'Blowback', 'Episode', '59', 'Facade', 'Episode', '60', 'Taken', 'Episode', '61', 'Frame', 'Episode', '62', 'Unveiled', 'Episode', '63', 'Hourglass', 'Episode', '64', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Episode', '65', 'Legacy', 'Episode', '66', 'Resurrection', 'DVD', 'Report']",Alias - The Complete Third Season

I wasn't disappointed--the formula was much the same as the others: Sydney's life is totally screwed, but she finds a way to cope with the changes by about the second or third episode.  Sure, there are characters missing, but I hardly think that makes the quality deteriorate--though I would admit that not seeing Sydney's mom definitely makes you wonder what's going on with her (and I thought Lena Olin was awesome in that role, so dangerous and so doggone seductive with just one look, so I'd be the first to say the show isn't the same without her, but it's still great without her).  (And what was up with the person analyzing the Ford F-150 scene??  That's a little TOO much thinking, it's a TV show, every show or movie has a hole somewhere if you look hard enough.  I mean, honestly, how many times would Sydney have been killed in the real world during the first two seasons?  Probably a lot.)  For me, it was just more of what I love: Alias!  Besides, as long as you have Sydney, Jack, Sloane every so often (who is a great villain without even really changing his expression much, because you really never know what he's really up to except that it's got to do with Rambaldi), Vaughn (another person whose expression hardly changes, but he's still very good at his role), and Sark, you can't go wrong.  I enjoyed this one because it had more of Sark, who I thought was pretty cool.  And I think adding Lauren to the mix was a good way to throw intrigue and very personal issues into it all.  There's nothing wrong with Season 3--I was addicted to it just as I was to Seasons 1 and 2.  And I've watched the first 2 episodes of Season 4, and that has been pretty good, too.  Just sit back and enjoy Alias without over-criticizing.  Either you'll love it or hate it anyway, no matter what I say...but I love it!

The worst clich&eacute; of the season, though, was BY FAR the addition of Lauren Reed, Michael Vaughn's wife. For a show known for its tight and believable characters, Mrs. Reed is embarassing.

The X-Files can be argued it lost steam around season 6 or 7, Law and Order was pretty much when they just rewrote same storylines with new people(how far back that would be? wow.) and Buffy had a pretty mediocre 6th season. A lot of people will say Alias' blemish was its 3rd season and yes it does have problems but then it was also quite entertaining and I even did another marathon and finished it in 2 days.Season 2's finale had CIA agent Sydney Bristow waking up in Hong Kong having been missing for 2 years. Now everything's changed: her dad's in jail, her friend Dixon is Director of their group, op-tech geek Marshall is still with Carrie Bowman with a surprise on the way and 2 worse things: her archnemesis Arvin Sloane is now a supposedly reformed humanitarian and her love Vaughn is actually re-married. Mysteriously there's a new group called the Covenant which are the main focus of villainy for this year.In season 2's episode Phase One, the CIA successfully dismantled and shut down all SD-6 cells and the Alliance members. Unlike the X-Files which didn't solve the Samantha Mulder mystery till season 7(very clumsily I might add), people were expecting a long drawn out fight but the series hit the refresh and got rid of SD-6 halfway. Season 3 does this with the 2 year missing but it also got slightly silly at times. The Rambaldi plot gets added on more and more to the point where it felt like there wasn't a foundation, just a ""yep, there's an added part to it we just found out"". How convenient.Another sillyness came from other conveniences as well, namely the elusive Mr. Sark and others who always seems to avoid capture even with no possible escape plan and the reappearance of supposed-to-be dead enemies. If you're planning a drinking game for Alias, take a swig everytime somebody mentions ""Rambaldi"" or the ""Passenger"", I'll swear you'll hit the floor really quickly.  But such is the world of Alias and can't knock all that much.Sure it's kind of a weak season but it's quite interesting too with plot twists, recurring and new characters and one nice addition right at the end of the season that gets more fleshed out in season 4 but still, you kinda know Alias is better than this.",4,4.5; disappointing yes but it kept me enthralled,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,2257,"['Shows', 'times', 'tend', 'falter', 'somewhere', 'X-Files', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'lost', 'steam', 'season', '6', '7', 'Law', 'Order', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'when', 'just', 'rewrote', 'same', 'storylines', 'new', 'people', 'how', 'far', 'back', 'would', 'be', 'wow', 'Buffy', 'had', 'pretty', 'mediocre', '6th', 'season', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'Alias', 'blemish', 'was', '3rd', 'season', 'yes', 'have', 'problems', 'then', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'even', 'did', 'marathon', 'finished', '2', 'days.Season', '2', 'finale', 'had', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'waking', 'up', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'having', 'been', 'missing', '2', 'years', 'Now', 'everything', 'changed', 'dad', 'jail', 'friend', 'Dixon', 'Director', 'group', 'op-tech', 'geek', 'Marshall', 'still', 'Carrie', 'Bowman', 'surprise', 'way', '2', 'worse', 'things', 'archnemesis', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'now', 'supposedly', 'reformed', 'humanitarian', 'love', 'Vaughn', 'actually', 're-married', 'Mysteriously', 'new', 'group', 'called', 'Covenant', 'are', 'main', 'focus', 'villainy', 'year.In', 'season', '2', 'episode', 'Phase', 'One', 'CIA', 'successfully', 'dismantled', 'shut', 'down', 'SD-6', 'cells', 'Alliance', 'members', 'X-Files', 'did', ""n't"", 'solve', 'Samantha', 'Mulder', 'mystery', 'till', 'season', '7', 'very', 'clumsily', 'might', 'add', 'people', 'were', 'expecting', 'long', 'drawn', 'fight', 'series', 'hit', 'refresh', 'got', 'rid', 'SD-6', 'halfway', 'Season', '3', '2', 'year', 'missing', 'also', 'got', 'slightly', 'silly', 'times', 'Rambaldi', 'plot', 'added', 'more', 'more', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'foundation', 'just', 'yep', 'added', 'part', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'How', 'convenient.Another', 'sillyness', 'came', 'other', 'conveniences', 'as', 'well', 'namely', 'elusive', 'Mr.', 'Sark', 'others', 'who', 'always', 'avoid', 'capture', 'even', 'possible', 'escape', 'plan', 'reappearance', 'supposed-to-be', 'dead', 'enemies', ""'re"", 'planning', 'drinking', 'game', 'Alias', 'take', 'swig', 'everytime', 'somebody', 'mentions', 'Rambaldi', 'Passenger', ""'ll"", 'swear', ""'ll"", 'hit', 'floor', 'really', 'quickly', 'such', 'world', 'Alias', 'ca', ""n't"", 'knock', 'much.Sure', 'kind', 'weak', 'season', 'quite', 'interesting', 'too', 'plot', 'twists', 'recurring', 'new', 'characters', 'one', 'nice', 'addition', 'right', 'end', 'season', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'season', '4', 'still', 'kinda', 'know', 'Alias', 'better']",Alias - The Complete Third Season
807249,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B0001I55ZQ,Danno,"[2, 4]","""Alias"" is creator J.J. Abrams' slick TV update of James Bond, Mission Impossible, and the Avengers for the 21st Century. Sure, it has about as much to do with the real CIA as a can of Chef Boyardee has to do with authentic Italian cuisine, but that isn't the point. Abrams has given his audience a delicious spy fantasy worthy of some of Ian Fleming's novels, and ""Alias"" is an incredible success on its own terms.All ""Alias"" seasons thusfar are enjoyable, but the third season may be best suited for DVD. Abrams decided to weave individual episode plots into a larger story arc with three key components. Firstly, there's the mystery of agent Sydney Bristow(lead actress Jennifer Garner)'s amnesia for the past two years. Secondly, there's the rise of a new terrorist organization called the Covenant, featuring the villainous Sark (David Anders). Last, but not least, is the enigmatic (and supposedly reformed criminal mastermind) Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), and his attempts to manipulate and coerce those around him to do his bidding.""Alias"" packs a powerful punch where other, similar series can only muster a limp wrist-slapping. Credit is due to Abrams' stress on family and interpersonal relationships, his creation of believable supporting characters, and an excellent array of character actors employed to bring Abrams' vision to life. Garner attracts most of the media's attention (and understandably so, since she's not only beautiful and talented but also possesses a charming girlish quality) - but it's the rest of the cast that kept me tuning in time and time again. Unlike ""Dark Angel,"" which debuted at around the same time, ""Alias"" prefers not to use its supporting characters as comic relief. I'm not entirely thrilled about the series' repeated interludes regarding the mysterious Renaissance ""prophet"" Rambaldi and his many inventions, but it does provide Abrams with a ""DaVinci Code""-style twist that traditional spy dramas don't have.I can't and won't reveal any of the plot twists and turns. Taken as a whole, this is a very enjoyable 22 hours for anyone who likes cloak-and-dagger material.

807250,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B0001I55ZQ,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[3, 7]","I missed the majority of episodes that comprised the third season of ALIAS so I was understandably anxious to get my hands on this six-disc DVD set of what is one of my few delights on television these days.This DVD set is simply stunning in both presentation and content.The packaging for these shows have always offered something surprising and this season is no exception. As was the case with the second season we have here a slip-over case that reveals additional artwork once it is removed. What I found of particular interest however is the attractive plastic accordion method for storing the DVDs. Gone are the keepcases for each disc, instead we have separate plastic `pages' each containing one disc. There is also a handsomely put together booklet detailing short synoposis of each show and details of the special features.The end of the second season left CIA agent Sydney Bristow in what can be described as one of the best cliffhanging moments in television history. Waking up after falling unconscious following a particularly brutal fight in her home Sydney is shocked to discover that two years have passed - two years of which she has no memory. Furthermore everyone (except for a couple of people) believed her to be dead. The main thrust of the third season is Sydney's quest to uncover the truth about those missing two years and find her way back into the trust of the CIA.Many things have changed in the intervening years. Dixon is now the head of CIA operations, Vaughn is married and has left the agency to teach French and Sydney's father is imprisoned for working with her traitorous mother in a determined quest to learn the truth of Sydney's whereabouts. Also, Sydney's arch nemesis Sloane is now a trusted CIA informant.Firstly the performances in the third season of ALIAS are uniformly excellent. The entire cast (especially Jennifer Garner, Ron Rifkin and Victor Garber) and Kevin Weisman is in top comic form as techno-genius (the Q of the ALIAS universe) Marshall.The plotting of these episodes also moves along at a brisk pace and (in what will come as no surprise to devotees of the show) they are both engaging and intriguing.Of particular interest is the audio commentary that accompanies the first episode of the season. Rather than having members of the cast and crew do the commentary we are instead treated to a fan commentary. Two real-life ALIAS fans speak on the shoe and there observations and comments are more engaging than the typical commentaries.Jennifer Garner herself can be heard on a commentary on the third disc. This commentary is good humored and actually very funny, especially when Ken Olin (the director of the episode) does an imitation of Garners mother.Well recommended.",5,Not the best season - but fun and entertaining,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,2735,"['missed', 'majority', 'episodes', 'comprised', 'third', 'season', 'ALIAS', 'was', 'understandably', 'anxious', 'get', 'hands', 'six-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'what', 'one', 'few', 'delights', 'television', 'days.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'simply', 'stunning', 'presentation', 'content.The', 'packaging', 'shows', 'have', 'always', 'offered', 'something', 'surprising', 'season', 'exception', 'was', 'case', 'second', 'season', 'have', 'here', 'slip-over', 'case', 'additional', 'artwork', 'removed', 'What', 'found', 'particular', 'interest', 'however', 'attractive', 'plastic', 'accordion', 'method', 'storing', 'DVDs', 'Gone', 'are', 'keepcases', 'disc', 'instead', 'have', 'separate', 'plastic', 'pages', 'containing', 'one', 'disc', 'also', 'handsomely', 'put', 'together', 'booklet', 'detailing', 'short', 'synoposis', 'show', 'details', 'special', 'features.The', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'left', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'one', 'best', 'cliffhanging', 'moments', 'television', 'history', 'Waking', 'up', 'falling', 'unconscious', 'following', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'fight', 'home', 'Sydney', 'shocked', 'discover', 'two', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'two', 'years', 'memory', 'everyone', 'couple', 'people', 'believed', 'be', 'dead', 'main', 'thrust', 'third', 'season', 'Sydney', 'quest', 'uncover', 'truth', 'missing', 'two', 'years', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'trust', 'CIA.Many', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'intervening', 'years', 'Dixon', 'now', 'head', 'CIA', 'operations', 'Vaughn', 'married', 'left', 'agency', 'teach', 'French', 'Sydney', 'father', 'imprisoned', 'working', 'traitorous', 'mother', 'determined', 'quest', 'learn', 'truth', 'Sydney', 'whereabouts', 'Also', 'Sydney', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Sloane', 'now', 'trusted', 'CIA', 'informant.Firstly', 'performances', 'third', 'season', 'ALIAS', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'entire', 'cast', 'especially', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'top', 'comic', 'form', 'techno-genius', 'Q', 'ALIAS', 'universe', 'Marshall.The', 'plotting', 'episodes', 'also', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'what', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'devotees', 'show', 'are', 'engaging', 'intriguing.Of', 'particular', 'interest', 'audio', 'commentary', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'Rather', 'having', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', 'do', 'commentary', 'are', 'instead', 'treated', 'fan', 'commentary', 'Two', 'real-life', 'ALIAS', 'fans', 'speak', 'shoe', 'observations', 'comments', 'are', 'more', 'engaging', 'typical', 'commentaries.Jennifer', 'Garner', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'commentary', 'third', 'disc', 'commentary', 'good', 'humored', 'actually', 'very', 'funny', 'especially', 'when', 'Ken', 'Olin', 'director', 'episode', 'imitation', 'Garners', 'mother.Well', 'recommended']",Alias - The Complete Third Season
807251,A3HT7THRDLPUHH,B0001I55ZQ,"D. Brunner ""tv on dvd fan""","[2, 3]","Season 3 of Alias may go down as the most disliked of all seasons by fans of the show. Why? Because Sydney and Vaughn are not together this season. Let me say that if that is your only basis for judgement and you turned away from the show and didn't bother to give it a second chance, you missed a darn good season.I thought breaking Syd and Vaughn apart was a great thing. Give this season credit, it tried something different. People complain that season 4 was too much like the first two, but yet when they get a different concept like this season they disapprove as well.The first episode of season 3 entitled ""The Two"", may very well be in the top 3 Alias episodes of all time. Jennifer Garner gives her most fantastic perfomance of all in this one. Having said that, the first 4 eps of S3 are some of my faves of all time. Sydney's world is turned upside down and these episodes are breathtaking.The season can be broken into two halves. The first half involves Sydney trying to recover her memory in which she's missing two years of her life. The second half involves the most hated character (I loved her, more on that later) in Alias history, Lauren Reed. Without giving too much away, she plays the biggest part in the last half of the season and Sydney is almost sidelined because of how big of a role Lauren plays. That's not a bad thing because the story is that good. Both halves are fantastic.As I said, some of my favorite Alias episodes ever are in this season. However, it is not a perfect season. Unlike almost everyone else, my problem is not the Sydney/Vaughn relationship or lack there of, but a few other things. I never got used to Dixon being in charge. The whole time it just seemed like he was out of place. Second would be the absense of Sydney's Mom, Irina. She was the best part of season 2 and it's too bad she wasn't in this one, and the explanation why she wasn't there was so flawed. And my last complaint would be the awkward discovery of Sydney's half sister. It got to the point where I wished she wouldn't have so many family members thrown into her world of being a spy.

Knouse,"[9, 12]","I have to admit to waiting a couple of months before finally picking up season 3, regardless of that incredible cliffhanger at the end of season 2.  The first eleven episodes deal with resolving Sydney's amnesia, coming to a close in the aptly titled episode 11, ""Full Disclosure.""  Those eleven episodes, for what it's worth, are all outstanding shows with very little predictability and stellar acting from everyone involved.  But then the show plummets into a state of limbo and encompasses an utter lack of direction.  By the time episode 14, ""Blowback,"" unfolds the show has hit rock bottom with the most boring ""Alias"" episode ever filmed.  However, just two episodes later, episode 16, ""Taken,"" challenges for the worst episode ever made, period.  The final scene of ""Taken"" is so horribly written as to be painful; what makes it more so is that I know somebody got paid to write that rubbish!  After that episode, however, the show had nowhere to go but up.  The Rambaldi storyline picks up the remains and slowly but surely renewed my interest in what the characters were doing and where they were headed.  It should be noted that during the first eleven episodes very little is even mentioned about Rambaldi and his devices and/or prophecies.  I found this an enjoyable vacation for the show to take while the characters were never more interesting or more attractive to the eye.  Sydney's mother is never seen, only relating online, in season 3, which is certainly a shame, but there are plenty of new and steadfast recurring characters to keep the show afloat and often very exciting.  The acting, except in the aforementioned dud episodes, is as good as ever, Jennifer Garner leading the way admirably with veteran actors pitching around the corners successfully time and again.  Ron Rifkin is especially memorable in many episodes.  If you just finished season 2 and are simply aching for more, but are simultaneously apprehensive due to the many average reviews present for season 3, don't wait.  I blazed through season 3 faster than either season 1 or season 2, the first eleven epsiodes in a matter of a few days, and I soonafter pre-ordered season 4 when I was finally finished.  The first half of season 3 is superb; the next few episodes are a travesty to behold for any ""Alias"" fan; but the final shows bring it all back together and have the story back on track for a promising season 4.

Season 3 is bordering on the ridiculous. The acting is first rate; no complaints there. But the story arc is pure cartoon. There isn't a single moment of reality in that series. Everything about this season is ridiculous. But that's not the worst of it.Other than Marshall (and sometimes Weiss), there is not one iota of humour here; even life's worst situations bring moments of funny if only to relieve the pressure. But season is absurdly serious - even more so than seasons 1 and 2 which weren't much better. I'm not saying it's not a good show overall. But it could be so much more if it didn't take itself so seriously. I suspect the show is popular with the younger macho crowd because of the excessive violence (and Jennifer!).I'm hoping season 4 brings SOME semblance of reality and a bit more fun along with a bit less violence .

But suddenly, somewhere in the second half of the season, it loses steam.  I wonder what the point that it happened was, because the season's best episode - the full throttle ""Full Disclosure"" - comes right in the center of the season, giving brilliant breadth to Sydney's trauma, and establishing the season's great sleight-of-hand - just when we thought we could trust Lauren (Melissa George), she becomes the villain.  Many fans disagree with me, but I think George's Lauren is the one thing the season has going for it - she's a sexy, vicious villainness, a grand vixen you love to hate.  Unfortunately, though, as the plots start to turn more towards Rimbaldi, Lauren and Vaughan and away from Sydney (she does very little of note after she discovers the truth in ""Full Disclosure), we lose interest fast.  Michael Vartan, it turns out, isn't much of an actor, and his increasing instability is tough to swallow.  And as the Rimbaldi plotlines become grander and grander, they become too silly for words, climaxing into the embarassing 11th hour addition of a sister that adds nothing to the season, nor to Sydney.  The action is still exciting, for the most part, and as always, Jennifer Garner and Victor Garber (more excitingly ruthless than ever) are terrific.

807255,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B0001I55ZQ,Eric J. Anderson,"[21, 26]","The merits of Alias are obvious if you watch seasons one and two. They lost their way in the third season, with frenetic action taking over -- taking too much time away from personal and interpersonal drama, characters acting out of character, and plots that were unbelievable even within the framework of a fantasy/spy/romance show. On any whim, the guys and gals would leave the CIA to go off on some rogue mission (where do they get the funding for all these insane worldwide operations?) and be back in time for supper, with no permanent repercussions.I don't know if the Rambaldi stuff will ever go anywhere or not. But what made Alias special was the relationships anyway. And these have been folded, spindled, and mutilated in season 3. The season finale looks like another ""good guy"" is going to turn out to be a betrayer. I won't say who, but it is horrible that they spent three seasons building up a special relationship between two people who had big issues at the beginning of the series, and now it looks like they want to destroy all the trust that was built. Perhaps they are simply running out of ideas, and they are simply going to destroy all the characters we have grown to love, like one of those sick John Irving novels.I never saw the series on TV, and I'm glad I've been able to watch the DVDs. I'm all caught up on the plot (implausible as it became) and ready for season four to begin in January. But unless they return to some of the scriptwriting sense and character consistency of the first and second seasons, I'm going to give up on it. I hope they can get back in the game.

807258,A3IVIS1OPYUU0X,B0001I55ZQ,Henry Perkins,"[50, 86]","[About 3.5 stars, a letdown from prior seasons.]I'm going to try something a little different for this review of ""Alias: The Complete Third Season"".  I'll start by telling you that ""Alias"" is still one of my favorite shows, and then I'm going to tell you about the worst episode of ""Alias"" to date, ""Blowback"", #14 of the third season.In ""Blowback"" Sydney and Vaughn are (unknown to them) chasing Lauren and Sark to first find the location of a ""plasma charge"" in a data vault, and then find the plasma charge itself.  There's a product placement for Ford F-150 trucks that only lasts 1.5 minutes but was the main focus of planning for the show, as revealed in the DVD bonus material.  And much of the script is a tricky device showing the same scenes twice, from two different perspectives.  The writer for this turkey was Laurence Andries, and the director Lawrence Trilling, one of the literally dozens of producers on ""Alias"".For a bomb of a type that he'd never seen, Marshall knew that detaching the blue wire and shorting the red and black wires together would both stop the countdown and render the external trigger inert.  (I guess there's an international standard wire color code for bombs that all terrorists follow.  That's certainly a comfort in these troubled times!)At the data vault facility: ""Our telescopes generate over 350 gigabytes of information per day.""  ""Not a problem.  Our vaults are designed to accomodate teraFLOPs.  You can store 20 years of data in the vault you've leased.""  (This is like comparing apples and aardvarks.  A FLOP is a FLoating-point OPeration, a unit of processing power.  Data is in bytes, units of storage.  What's the lease rate on 2.5 petabytes, with twice-daily backup, anyway?  Whatever it is, it must be worth it because the approximately TEN THOUSAND drives in that room were *really* quiet.)""Let me know when you're connected to the mainframe"" in the data vault.  (Must be what's generating all those teraFLOPs.  A real data vault needs a firewall and a high-speed traffic router; mainframes haven't been needed for mass storage since the 1980s.)While downloading data from one of many rooms with 2 petabytes each, it's echoed scrolling across the antiquated white on black block text screen at about 1200 bps.  (I guess they assume you can wait 50,000 years for your data.)The act of downloading data injects a virus into a running system.  Stopping the download on the sending end stops the spread of the virus on the infected receiving end.  (Even AOL users know viruses don't work this way.  Plus the CIA's virus detector tells you there's an infection by blanking the screen, but doesn't automatically stop the virus.  That's OK, though; Marshall is such a stud that he can manually quarantine the virus by typing commands furiously while the screen is still blanked.)The Ford F-150 product placement was both blatant and ironic.  The irony of this Ford ""promotion"" was that it showed the F-150 truck could be stolen so fast that they could keep a Mustang fleeing the scene in sight; that's got to be less than 5 seconds.  Of course, the F-150 fishtailed at least twice trying to keep up with the Mustang.  In addition to its ease of theft, the F-150 was chosen because it could push a parked car out of the way.  Yet while the Mustang could push an obstructing non-parked car out of its way, the F-150 couldn't do the same.  (The bonus material showed they spent several days planning this car chase scene, and 12 hours shooting it.  Apparently this left no time for anybody to read the script.)A ""plasma detector""?  Something that detects a gas so dispersed that the electrons aren't tied to any particular nuclei, with 100 feet of atmosphere and metal walls intervening?  (Puh-lease!  There's also the basic problem of an explosive sniffer being able to point to a source through metal ship decks, instead of following the air path to get there.  Or it having a fixed 100' straight line detection range, whether in open air or through multiple steel walls.)Every time Syd and Vaughn point their Glock pistols, they make hammer-cocking sounds.  (Glocks don't have hammers.)Sydney's generally got perceptions that would make Sherlock Holmes look myopic, yet she referred to the masked Lauren as ""him"".  (I must have missed the part of the briefing when they revealed that most male Covenant agents use mascara.  And one of these years the CIA's highly-trained agents will take the basic course that tells you not to stand within touching distance of someone when you have them at gunpoint.  But apparently not in 2004.)Crack shot Syd obviously couldn't shoot Lauren running away in a straight, narrow corridor at a distance of 8 yards, so she didn't even bother to try.  And Sydney's a runner; she was a track star in high school and college.  She successfully runs away from pursuing enemies in practically every episode.  Yet she couldn't catch up with Lauren.  (Script armor is better than Kevlar PLUS a jet pack!)- - - -In one of the DVD episode commentaries they mention that ""Alias"" episodes generally either shine or stink.  ""Blowback"" was quite the stinker.  Luckily for all of us there are still some shiny bits this season.  But be prepared to hold you nose occasionally for Season Three.  The acting is still top-notch, but the rest of the crew seriously needs to buy a clue.

The final fight between Sydney and faux-Francie had me on the edge of my seat, and then the cliffhanger was vintage J.J.Abrams.  Then it came back and it all went down the drain.Vaugn's wife, Lauren, is for lack of a better word... lame.  The fact that she turns out to be (spoiler) evil is so cliched.  The fact that she is ineptly dating Sark and is bad at keeping the secret, EVEN THOUGH SHE IS A SPY, is pretty ridiculous.  And I think the big reveal about Sydney's memory loss-- that she did it to herself-- is weak storytelling.  I mean, how dumb is Sydney?  Doesn't she know herself well enough to know that she wouldn't accept a loss of TWO YEARS without an explanation to her memory-less self?  Or did she just not understand the concept of NOT REMEMBERING?  And don't even get me started on Indiana Sydney and the Temple of Rambaldi.There are some good things about this season.  Dixon, Marshall and most of all Jack get a chance to shine.  But my firmest memory of this season is the moment when Sloane raises a stupid-looking green glowy hourglass over his hand and smashes it, with videogame cg-style, on the ground.

Sydney believes Sloane had something to do w/ her missing years, but he said that the Rambaldi device had told him only one word: peace. Now he is one of the top informants to the CIA. Sydney tries to go back to her normal life, which she discovers as impossible, now that Francie has been killed, Will is in witness protection program, her mother is nowhere to be found except for on the internet, and her father is in jail for communicating to her mother via the internet. Over the next 11 episodes is the plotline of Sydney recovering her missing years while being pursued by a mean NSC man as well as a new person in her life-Vaughn's new wife, Lauren Reed. The two are at odds w/ each other for most of the season. When the truth of her missing years is revealed, Sydney is shocked of what it is (hint:it has to do w/ the prophecy from season 1) and who tells it to her (terry o quin ((i forgot what his characters name was)) ). At the ending of that episode an assassination changes the storyline for the remaining 11 eps. of season 3-get ready an overused plot brought back in the form of Lauren-a double agent whose actions in this season resemble Irina Derevko very much. This in turn gives Jack and Vaughn something to talk about. Many new revelations are revealed this season- including lots of rambaldi stuff, a aunt for sydney (probably to make up for lack of appearance on mommy's part) as well as a semi-plotholed sister for sydney (watch the show and see what i mean) this one doesn't end w/ a bang as seasons 1 and 2 did, but it leaves you waiting january. luckily this will keep everyone company until then (lol) While the writing isn't as strong as before this is still RECOMMENDED, BUT ONLY AFTER PURCHASING SEASONS 1/2!!!",4,"alias-new direction, characters, and lots more new stuff!!!!",1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1860,"['Picking', 'up', 'where', 'season', '2', 'ended', 'w/', 'Sydney', 'learning', 'had', 'been', 'missing', 'two', 'years', 'how', 'season', 'Sydney', 'Sloane', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'w/', 'missing', 'years', 'said', 'Rambaldi', 'device', 'had', 'told', 'only', 'one', 'word', 'peace', 'Now', 'one', 'top', 'informants', 'CIA', 'Sydney', 'go', 'back', 'normal', 'life', 'impossible', 'now', 'Francie', 'been', 'killed', 'Will', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'mother', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'internet', 'father', 'jail', 'communicating', 'mother', 'internet', 'next', '11', 'episodes', 'plotline', 'Sydney', 'recovering', 'missing', 'years', 'being', 'pursued', 'mean', 'NSC', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'person', 'life-Vaughn', 'new', 'wife', 'Lauren', 'Reed', 'two', 'are', 'odds', 'w/', 'other', 'most', 'season', 'When', 'truth', 'missing', 'years', 'revealed', 'Sydney', 'shocked', 'what', 'hint', 'do', 'w/', 'prophecy', 'season', '1', 'who', 'terry', 'o', 'quin', 'i', 'forgot', 'what', 'characters', 'name', 'was', 'ending', 'episode', 'assassination', 'storyline', 'remaining', '11', 'eps', 'season', '3-get', 'overused', 'plot', 'brought', 'back', 'form', 'Lauren-a', 'double', 'agent', 'actions', 'season', 'resemble', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'very', 'much', 'turn', 'Jack', 'Vaughn', 'something', 'talk', 'Many', 'new', 'revelations', 'are', 'revealed', 'season-', 'including', 'lots', 'rambaldi', 'stuff', 'aunt', 'sydney', 'probably', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'appearance', 'mommy', 'part', 'as', 'well', 'semi-plotholed', 'sister', 'sydney', 'watch', 'show', 'see', 'what', 'i', 'mean', 'one', ""n't"", 'end', 'w/', 'bang', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'did', 'waiting', 'january', 'luckily', 'will', 'keep', 'everyone', 'company', 'then', 'lol', 'writing', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'still', 'RECOMMENDED', 'BUT', 'ONLY', 'AFTER', 'PURCHASING', 'SEASONS', '1/2']",Alias - The Complete Third Season

On top of that she notices a wedding ring on him. She was  assumed dead so he eventually moved on and married Lauren Reed who also works for the CIA.He still loves Sydney but he also loves his wife and doesn't want to hurt her. Anyway a lot goes down in this season. Sydney trys to find out where she was for 2 years. She also finds out that she has a sister . Sloane had an affair with her mom and her sister is Sloane's daughter. On top of things Lauren is really bad and is a spy for the covident. Jack realizes it first and tells Vaugn. Vaughn finds the idea crazy and doesn't believe it until he finds things of hers to convince him otherwise. Vaughn becomes obsessed with getting revenge on his wife especially after he's captured and tortured by her and Sark.Anyway this season is full of action and surprises and it's always un-predictible just like the other seasons. It does get goofy though and some things are hard to believe. I mean Sydney is a tough girl. It's out of character that she would erase her own memory to get rid of the pain of seeing Vaughn married. The show is the still the funnest on tv though even if this season wasn't the best. Lauren Reed was a great villain though and her scenes with Sark are probably the most entertaining scenes.

Martin ""ffej26""","[3, 4]","While not as exciting and intense as the first 2 seasons, Alias's third season still proves it's one of the best television shows on the air. Boasting some of the finest actors working today, starting with the magnificant Jennifer Garner, who should have won the emmy this year based her performance in the season opener, it's truly heartbreaking.  Victor Garber, Ron Rifkin, Michael Vartan, Greg Grunburg, and David Anders are all phenomenal. The storyline this year isn't as ""edge of your seat"" like last year but it did keep my interest and it does build to an excellent climax. The beginning is all about trying to find out what happened to Syndey, and we finally find out in the amazing episode Full Disclosure, but the majority of the season is based on Lauren, Vaugns wife who is obviously not who she says she is, and the final episode gives us another shocking cliffhanger. I think the major disappointments was Melissa George who played Lauren. She's quite boring and was a sad replacement for the wonderful Lena Olin, so it was hard to get into any of her scenes, and she just didn't fit in with the remarkable cast.Leno Olin, Bradley Whitford(Will), and Merrin Dungey(Francie) are also gone, with a guest appearance in a few eps from  Will and Francie.

807264,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B0001I55ZQ,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[11, 19]","Season 3 of Alias ups the ante in all areas: the drama is more heartfelt, the budget is higher, and the action is more plentiful.  In fact, for its first half, Season 3 is pretty much the best of Alias, until the series nosedives HARD halfway in, and abruptly degrades into some of the worst television I've ever seen.  After such a strong first half, it's disheartening that the show turns into what I could best describe as a live-action remake of the old ""GI Joe"" cartoon, as rewritten by children under the influence of Magic Marker fumes.  But hardcore Alias fans, please don't hit that ""review not helpful"" button yet!Season 3 begins exactly where Season 2 left off: CIA super-agent Sydney Bristow awakens after a battle with a doppelganger of her best friend, only to find 2 years have passed.  A woman out of her time, Syd seeks to discover what happened to her, while at the same time make sense of and come to terms with the manifold changes in her life.  For one, former head villain Sloane now seems to be a redeemed champion of peace.  Syd's father Jack is in prison, though Syd takes care of this promptly.  Most importantly, Vaughn, Syd's love interest, is now married to a wenchy Federal agent who doesn't like Sydney in the least.The unfolding suspense of Syd's missing years is nicely complimented by phenomenal action, as Syd battles ""The Covenant,"" a SPECTRE-type global organization that's basically the same as Season 1's The Alliance.  Whereas Season 2's action was an improvement over Season 1's ""Buffy""-type shenanigans, Season 3 is the best yet.  Season 2 thankfully admitted that a spy needs MORE than just a wig and a few martial arts moves to survive, and in that season Syd carried some weaponry and took out several foes.  In Season 3 she's become a full-scale Terminator, wasting enemies left and right and always carrying a weapon.  Makes you chuckle at the Season 1 episode where she bawled over  killing someone on a mission.But this is also where Season 3 fails.  Sark, the blonde-haired, English-accented Sloane footstool of Season 2, is back, and he acts as Syd's foil throughout.  Seriously, no matter where in the world Syd is, Sark will show up to throw a monkeywrench in the works.  This gets old fast, and each time Syd just knocks the guy out and runs away.  She could just save herself so much heartache by just pumping a round in the guy's head, like, you know, a real spy would do.  Especially when you consider all of the people Sark has murdered.  And especially when you consider how much of a thorn Sark gradually becomes in Sydney's side over the course of this rocky season.However the main problem with Season 3 is the quick wrap-up of Syd's missing years, midway through the season.  At first it's hinted that Syd was used by the Covenant as an assassin, but this engaging idea is dropped mercilessly and unconvincingly, in one single episode.  This same episode also features the unwelcome return of Season 1's hokey ""chosen one"" subplot, which denigrates the series into cheap ""Buffy"" sub-standards.  That being said, this episode also features one of the series' best action scenes, as Syd et al parachute into a Covenant base and raise havoc on full auto.After this episode, things get worse and worse.  The ""chosen one"" junk takes predominance, and whereas the first half of the season was a taut action thriller about globe-trotting spies, the latter half becomes mired in prophecies, annoying villains, and completely stupid and unnecessary character revelations (in what can only be seen as something the writers came up with during a lunch break, a main character discovers that he/she has a sister; another character is revealed to be evil, a cheap revelation which completely undermines the drama and emotion of preceding episodes).  It's kind of the reverse of Season 2, which started off poorly but revamped itself for a strong second half.But on to the good stuff.  Let's talk about the action again, just for a minute.  Car chases, explosions, martial arts (still not as believable as the krav maga techniques on ""24,"" though), and gunfights galore.  Nice use of blood quibs, too.  Season 3 is pretty gory.  Usually on TV, a person just falls down when shot, but here the blood flows freely.  In other good points, the high production values make each episode seem like a glossy feature film.The two other big positives: one, Syd's mother is mercifully out of the picture.  Man, the soap-operatic melodrama between her and Syd in Season 2 drove me to drink.  Jettisoning her character freed the show in a big way.  And two, there is a wonderfully diminished amount of crying this season, at least for the first half.  In previous seasons, Syd cried every five minutes, but here entire episodes will pass, unbelievably, without her shedding a tear.  It's good to see our girl growing up.Guest stars aren't as irritating this time out, with even Vivica Fox presenting herself in fine fashion (though she did look a bit ridiculous running and firing an M-16 at the same time).  Quentin Tarantino makes a welcome return as smarmy rogue agent McKennas Cole, completely blowing the similarly-styled Sark character out of the water.  The best guest performance by far is courtesy director David Cronenberg, as an easygoing, drug-dabbling explorer of the mind.So in the end, I'm just some anonymous Amazon reviewer who has a problem with the season.  But bear in mind that series creator and producer JJ Abrams agrees, publicly stating that he'd lost his way with Season 3 and planned to re-tool the show.  Let's hope he fixes it up right.  Alias has the potential to be a great show, with strong production values and a strong cast.  But this season it shoots itself in the foot by trying to become something that it's not.",3,"The Crying Spy gets amnesia, doesn't forget to keep crying",1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,5786,"['Season',

I know that I will get plenty of negative votes simply because I am not giving it five stars and saying nothing more than &quot;THis is dEfinately kewl. Buy iT now!&quot; So be it.As has been said many times before, Season 3 was a huge letdown from the previous two (which are stunningly excellent). This decline can be traced back to the episode that aired after the Super Bowl in Season 2. When the creators used that epsiode (one of the most exciting in TV history) to &quot;restart&quot; the series so new viewers wouldn't have to learn all the backstory of SD-6 and so forth, it eroded and (in Season 3) eventually wiped out all the best elements of the show. The Rambaldi elements became incredulous. The twists, turns, and liaisons became arbitrary, forced, and repetitive. Worst of all, the crackling tension in the relationships has downshifted into sniping and griping. And Lena Olin is sorely missed.The fall of SD-6 and the end of Sydney Bristow's double life may be likened to the Scoobies of &quot;Buffy&quot; graduating high school. It may have been inevitable but things were never the same after.I love &quot;Alias&quot; and I still ask people to ty it out - both so my friends can enjoy it and so its ratings will improve! The feature film flavor still lingers, the actors are all engaging, the look and music are still cool, and Jennifer Garner is so sweet she should be illegal. It's better than 95 percent of the pablum on the tube. But, for the first time, it didn't kill me to miss an episode during this season.

Sydney wakes up in Hong Kong, calls in to CIA and Agent Vaughn comes to meet her.  As Sydney tries to kiss and embrace the man she knows to be her boyfriend, she notices something is not quite right, Vaughn is wearing a wedding band.  As if that wasn't enough of a punch in the gut, here's the real kicker, Sydney's been missing and presumed dead for 2 years.  Now, Sydney must find out where she's been for 2 years, who is responsible for her current dilemma, and how can she cope with Vaughn being married for over a year, when the last thing she remembers is beating up a clone of her former roommate, Francie.  What a way to come back to work.""Alias: Season Three"" really shook things up for the show, even more so than the previous season did when the CIA finally took down SD-6 and Sydney and Vaughn finally hooked up.  This season basically took what Sydney and the audience knew from the first 2 seasons of this incredible show and turned it upside down.  ""Alias: Season Three"" delivered some very unique twists as Sydney struggles to discover what to make of her life now that everything is different, and a new terrorist threat emerges called The Covenant, and this group is not led by Arvin Sloane.

807270,A1403J18C3KRAC,B0001I55ZQ,Justin F.,"[1, 1]","Season 3 was a big reset in the show certainly and sadly for me not a particularly popular one among fans. The biggest reason for this disdain seems to be the road block in the Sydney/Vaughn relationship, I don't watch shows for character romance personally and had no problem with this whatsoever. The other is the removal of Will and Francie from the show and as a result the decrease in emphasis on Sydney's home and social life. I liked Will's on and off investigation storyline in season 1 and Francie's double trouble arc in the back half of season two and the show was different without them for sure. I still loved the increase in intensity this season brought though and that's why for me it's roughly equal with season 2, ahead of the also very popular season 1, as my favorite of the show. Season three of Alias wasn't meant to warm hearts or really even to get to know the characters better- which I understand some people will have issues with- it was meant to bring an aggressive, dark twist to the overall show almost every week and it almost always succeeded in doing that. This is the most mysterious season of the show for sure- I don't think the other four seasons combined keep the audience and/or and most of the characters in the dark as much as this middle season of the show- and I for one have always loved that approach.I started watching Alias in the dark in the early morning hours via TNT reruns- there would be five or six episodes straight one, maybe two nights a week- and I think this season more than any other excels in that type of format. If you watch one or two episodes a day (or more) on DVD I think you'll probably like season three more than the original run audience as well. Maybe it wouldn't have played as well watching one episode a week with all the time to think about the characters, their lives, etc. built in. I was essentially holding my breath from one episode to the next in five or six hour bunches and didn't have time to focus on anything but the cliff hanger that just ended the previous episode. Regardless of how I watched it I was completely hooked by season three when I first watched it and I am still hooked.I consider the episode ""Conscious,"" just before the halfway point of the season to be one of the two or three best of the series and to this day I still only watch it the same way in which I saw it for the first time- at night, in the dark, and in silence as I refuse to let anyone disturb me while this one is on the screen. It has to be one of my 15-20 favorites TV episodes of all time from any show. The episode ""Full Disclosure,"" just two episodes later is an instant classic as well that closes out the big story line of the first half of the season beautifully and then at the very end starts the big story of the rest of the season in absolutely stunning fashion. Season 3 is what I'd call a dedicated arc season whereas seasons one and two were more balanced between arcs and characters. For me the story emphasis was amazing because I thought the arcs were good enough to warrant the extra attention. Many people did miss the personal touches from the previous two years though and I do at least understand this criticism, I just don't really care about it that much when I'm as engrossed in the stories as I still am when watching season three.",5,"The Most Dramatic, Intense Season to me",1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,3328,"['Season', '3', 'was', 'big', 'reset', 'show', 'certainly', 'sadly', 'not', 'particularly', 'popular', 'one', 'fans', 'biggest', 'reason', 'disdain', 'be', 'road', 'block', 'Sydney/Vaughn', 'relationship', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'shows', 'character', 'romance', 'personally', 'had', 'problem', 'whatsoever', 'other', 'removal', 'Will', 'Francie', 'show', 'result', 'decrease', 'emphasis', 'Sydney', 'home', 'social', 'life', 'liked', 'Will', 'investigation', 'storyline', 'season', '1', 'Francie', 'double', 'trouble', 'arc', 'back', 'half', 'season', 'two', 'show', 'was', 'different', 'sure', 'still', 'loved', 'increase', 'intensity', 'season', 'brought', 'though', 'why', 'roughly', 'equal', 'season', '2', 'ahead', 'also', 'very', 'popular', 'season', '1', 'favorite', 'show', 'Season', 'three', 'Alias', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'warm', 'hearts', 'really', 'even', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'better-', 'understand', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'issues', 'with-', 'was', 'meant', 'bring', 'aggressive', 'dark', 'twist', 'overall', 'show', 'almost', 'week', 'almost', 'always', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'most', 'mysterious', 'season', 'show', 'sure-', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'four', 'seasons', 'combined', 'keep', 'audience', 'and/or', 'most', 'characters', 'dark', 'as', 'much', 'middle', 'season', 'show-', 'one', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'approach.I', 'started', 'watching', 'Alias', 'dark', 'early', 'morning', 'hours', 'TNT', 'reruns-', 'would', 'be', 'five', 'six', 'episodes', 'straight', 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'nights', 'week-', 'think', 'season', 'more', 'other', 'excels', 'type', 'format', 'watch', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'day', 'more', 'DVD', 'think', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'season', 'three', 'more', 'original', 'run', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'Maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'played', 'as', 'well', 'watching', 'one', 'episode', 'week', 'time', 'think', 'characters', 'lives', 'etc', 'built', 'was', 'essentially', 'holding', 'breath', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'five', 'six', 'hour', 'bunches', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'focus', 'anything', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'just', 'ended', 'previous', 'episode', 'Regardless', 'how', 'watched', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked', 'season', 'three', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'am', 'still', 'hooked.I', 'consider', 'episode', 'Conscious', 'just', 'halfway', 'point', 'season', 'be', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'best', 'series', 'day', 'still', 'only', 'watch', 'same', 'way', 'saw', 'first', 'time-', 'night', 'dark', 'silence', 'refuse', 'let', 'anyone', 'disturb', 'one', 'screen', 'be', 'one', '15-20', 'favorites', 'TV', 'episodes', 'time', 'show', 'episode', 'Full', 'Disclosure', 'just', 'two', 'episodes', 'later', 'instant', 'classic', 'as', 'well', 'out', 'big', 'story', 'line', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'beautifully', 'then', 'very', 'end', 'big', 'story', 'rest', 'season', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'fashion', 'Season', '3', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'dedicated', 'arc', 'season', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'were', 'more', 'balanced', 'arcs', 'characters', 'story', 'emphasis', 'was', 'amazing', 'thought', 'arcs', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'warrant', 'extra', 'attention', 'Many', 'people', 'did', 'miss', 'personal', 'touches', 'previous', 'two', 'years', 'do', 'least', 'understand', 'criticism', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'that', 'much', 'when', ""'m"", 'engrossed', 'stories', 'still', 'am', 'when', 'watching', 'season', 'three']",Alias - The Complete Third Season

As if to keep the series running instead of bringing the plot to a satisfying conclusion, Season 3 saw the introduction of a completely unnecessary character in Lauren (nothing against Melissa George, however) - and a rehash of the same ""secret organization bent on world domination"" theme that was present in the first two seasons.This season marks the tumultuous decline of the entire series, culminating, or rather flatlining, with the horrendous conclusion in Season 5.

I am disappointed that ABC is holding off the return of Alias until January 2005. They have also not rerun any of season three episodes over the summer. Hopefully they will show all the new episodes without a break or pre-epting the show through the end of season four. JJ Abrams is still the best writer/director/producer in the business today.

807278,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0001I55ZQ,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[2, 5]","Let me say first off that I *really* love the Alias series. I love the multiple sides of each character, I love that the heroine is smart, skilled but also vulnerable. I think that season 2 was *fantastic* and incredibly well done. That all being said, I was a bit disappointed with Season 3. I think if I'd seen Season 3 first - without any background - that I would have been blown away with what it offered. However, Season 2 was so incredibly brilliant, so well crafted from start to finish, that Season 3 was just not up to that same standard. I'll try to give this review without giving away any of the key plot points in this season.First off, some of the episdoes have HUGE plot holes that truly defy definition. Sydney, who is super-fast at running and super-accurate at shooting, suddenly loses these skills when it's convenient. Characters see-saw incredibly from feeling one way to feeling the exact opposite with very little reason. Some product placements in the show are completely blatant and obvious - but not only that, the placement is done in such a silly way that you get BAD impressions about those products.However, the huge issue I have with this season is with the entire premise. Season 2 was brilliant. Sydney and Vaughn built up an incredible relationship, full of strength and meaning, and the big cliffhanger at the end of Season 2 was that she'd been ""lost"" for 2 years and presumed dead. Vaughn had remarried.So we begin Season 3 with Sydney back - still loving him - and Vaughn having ""moved on"" but of course still in love with her. Good enough - this has been done on Star Trek and many other shows before. However, it was REALLY EVIL to have a good part of this season involve a married man - i.e. Vaughn - with a wife who married him in good faith, and Sydney being the ""other woman""!! What, were you supposed to root for Sydney to break up a married couple? Root for Vaughn to leave his wife, who he loved? The whole thing was completely nasty as far as I was concerned. Regardless of what might be revealed later in the season, the whole premise was just nasty. I took no pleasure at all in watching any of those episodes.On top of this, both of Sydney's friends - Will and Francie - are out of the story. Both helped make Sydney a full, rounded, human character. Now all she had was her way-too-obsessed father and her cheating-in-his-heart married boyfriend. In the meantime, the main plot - Rambaldi - has been dismissed in a completely ridiculous way. Sloan says ""Oh it only gave me blank paper and ""peace"" when I assembled it, so I gave up on my 20 year quest."" As if! Plus he threw away the paper as being meaningless? And everyone accepted this? There was no longer any real immediacy or meaning to what the group was doing. Even as the season neared its ""climactic ending"", the things brought in seemed forced and artificial. The final season cliffhanger was completely silly. Again, compared to Season 2 which ended with an amazing twist that made you really think and wonder, Season 3 ended with a NON-revalation which made you wonder, ""What was THAT all about?""I definitely watched season 3 and still consider Alias to be one of the best series out there. I am really sad, though, that they ""fell"" so much compared to Season 2. Obviously they had the skills from Season 2. They could have made the series just as incredible. Why did they go with less well written plots and with the inane product placements? Were they thinking they could coast now that people were so in love with Season 2?

807281,A2GAINX7PJLP2W,B0001I55ZQ,Magin,"[7, 9]","I almost feel bad for rating this season so low, but after the first two seasons, it's not unreasonable to hold Alias to a higer standard than we see here.I absolutely guarantee you that no office, CIA or otherwise, would tolerate the amount of lovelorn crap that dominates this season of television.  Seriously.  Let's have a workgroup that consists of a man, his wife, his former lover, and the former lover's dad.  And it's not like these relationships are particularly secret.  There.  I said it.Screenwriting 101: To create tension where there is none, write a love triangle.High standards are a double-edged sword.  Season 3 lives up to that standard in many ways.  Jennifer Garner, et al, turn in the same fantastic performances we've come to expect.  There are some genuinely unexpected twists, and some really complex subplots.  The absence of Lena Olin and Bradley Cooper is sorely felt, but it's not a gaping void.  Putting an actor of Ron Rifkin's caliber in the background is criminal.  Melissa George is terrible.  David Anders is great, but his character lost some of his dimensions.  Like, two of his three.Screenwriting 102: When in doubt, have a bomb with a timer.  Gets ya every time, doesn't it?They really did start out strong, though.  Season 2's cliffhanger established what could have been a two (or even three!) year story arc that could have guided the writers the same way the SD-6 arc did for the first year and a half.  And instead, it's a sideline plot for 10 episodes, wrapped up in 1 episode, and then swept aside while the show drifts rather aimlessly.Screenwriting 103: Everything has a remote control with handy red and green lights.What made SD-6 and the Alliance a great enemy was the fact that  we saw them every once in a while.  Keeping the Covenant so nebulous and far removed from the audience diminishes the tension that's derived from their spooky name.  The big bads we see are the likes of Sark, Cole, and Lauren.  They're young and hip and have great hairstyles.  Blofeld, they ain't.  Rather, I'd describe them as being prissy; more like TV lawyers than anything else.  Not all that scary.  The writers failed to sell the threat here.Screenwriting 104: If it worked once, try doing it ten more times.The remarkable thing, though, is the fact that the show survives.  It does a lot of things wrong, and doesn't live up to its legacy, but it's still not bad.  For me, and probably for the network as well, the next season will either make or break Alias.  It's in the sophomore slump; if it comes out, it'll be stronger than ever.

And she comes back to find that Vaughn is married, her dad is in jail, and Sloane is a good guy.  Hold on to your hats, it's season 3.Syd quickly begins to get back on her feet, going back to work for the CIA under her former partner Dixon.  But her search for the two years missing from her memory takes her to some pretty strange places.  Most shocking of all is the fact that she killed someone in cold blood.  It's beginning to look more and more like some group called The Covenant is involved.  What could this all mean?  And can she successfully work with Vaughn and his pretty new wife Lauren?I have watched this show faithfully since day 1, becoming a die hard fan about episode three.  I faithfully tuned in for this season and spent as much time as always speculating on what each line of dialog and plot twist meant.  But it wasn't as entertaining as the first two seasons.  The twists felt forced, and the emphasis on Rimbaldi near the end overwhelmed me.  That's one storyline I'd love for them to completely leave behind.This six disc set is up to the previous set's high standards even if the show isn't.  All 22 episodes are shown in wide screen and full surround sound.  There's a fan commentary, which is fun if not informative, and two commentaries with cast and crew.  Disc six contains an animated episode from Syd's missing two years (forgettable), and the usually behind the scenes stuff.  This is actually very interesting and I watched it all intently.  Also included are a handful of deleted scenes and the outtake real for the season.While the show stumbled in season 3, it has regained its footing in season 4.

807284,A368H5Z546WGLG,B0001I55ZQ,"Matthew C. Russoniello ""truthtakestime""","[18, 26]","""Alias"" is the best show on television.  Period.From the beginning, the show has been nothing but purely original, captivating, exciting, entertaining, emotional, beautiful, gritty, and intelligent.  It looks like nothing else on TV, it sounds like nothing else on TV, and when you watch it, you have no choice but to become engrossed in the storyline and in the characters.Seasons 1 and 2 were pretty straight forward until midway through season 2 when the SD-6 element was removed from the show.  Some fans and critics became skeptical that the show would simplify itself in order to grab more viewers.  But anyone who's watched the show since then knows that it is still the most complex and suprising show on the air (and really, we had to get rid of SD-6...How many more times could Syd be suspected of double-agentry without being found out?).Season 3 has proved to be another test of the audience's devotion.  Many people have said that this current season (season 3) is subparr and that it just hasn't lived up to the previous two.  I disagree, and here's why:--There is no other show that has changed its direction so quickly while still maintaining the heart of the show.  Each season has been astonishingly different from the last and each season the writing is consistently superb and the story lines remain fresh.--""Alias"" is the art of storytelling.  If nothing else, the viewer feels he gets closer to the bigger picture of the ""Alias"" universe with each episode.  5 episodes until the end of season 3, we are still going back and filling in pieces from season 1.  It is a puzzle that is continuously being filled in and no other show has the same constantness.  Season 3 may be different from the first two, but in its own right it is still uniquely ""Alias"" and is every bit as addicting as the previous two years have been.--The show never fails to shock and amaze. Just when you think you have one thing figured out, another secret will be revealed.  Makes for compelling storytelling and TV.--THe acting is just superb.  If Jennifer Garner's Golden Globe and 2 Emmy nominations don't speak for themselves, then just watch the emotional scene at the end of ""The Two"" with her and Michael Vartan (Vaughn) in the hallway in which she expresses her hurt over his betrayal.  There is not an actor on the show who disappoints.My only complaint is that Irina (Sydney's mother, played by Lena Olin) was absent this season.  She brought so much to the show last year, and while they've gotten along just fine without her, I miss her character and her interaction with Sydney and Jack.  But it appears as if it may be shaping up for her return, so let's cross our fingers.All in all, I would say that I know the show won't always please everyone, but don't dismiss this season based on it's different direction.

807285,A1WWOZONMZ55SZ,B0001I55ZQ,"Mauricio Carvallo ""Melf""","[3, 6]","Wow, now that i've finished watching the dvds i question a lot what most have been saying about this season, yes, i am part of those who think this was an excellent season. In fact i liked it more than season 2. True, the story is not as strong as the last season, but hey, most of the missions looked more of a swat team than cia spies, specially in the second half. In this season the missions go back to how they were. Great characters, environment, mistery, missions and characters from the past enrich this season more than the last one.The season opener of this season just me away, one of the best episodes there have been, and the guest stars were superb. The character of Lauren was well done and mysterious, i think even more than Irina Derevko, since most of the time she was in a cell. The mistery leading up to the half season got me hooked and then the surprise with vaughn's wife made me stay.However, it is true that there were a few mistakes in the way, the relationship between syd and vaughn looks like a classic sope opera, and kathya and jack's relationship is ridiculous as well as barnett and slone's. And yes, the story leading up to the end of the season was a bit stronger in season 2, but most that say it was a bad season are those who saw it in the tv, this season needs to be watched with certan fludity and continuty in order to appreciate it best.Don't listen to those who say this was wreck! it is more similar to the 1st season, which was perfect, than the second one.",4,Excellent  Season,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,1502,"['Wow', 'now', 'i', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'watching', 'dvds', 'i', 'question', 'lot', 'what', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'saying', 'season', 'yes', 'i', 'am', 'part', 'who', 'think', 'was', 'excellent', 'season', 'fact', 'i', 'liked', 'more', 'season', '2', 'True', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'last', 'season', 'hey', 'most', 'missions', 'looked', 'more', 'swat', 'team', 'cia', 'spies', 'specially', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'missions', 'go', 'back', 'how', 'were', 'Great', 'characters', 'environment', 'mistery', 'missions', 'characters', 'past', 'enrich', 'season', 'more', 'last', 'one.The', 'season', 'opener', 'season', 'just', 'away', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'guest', 'stars', 'were', 'superb', 'character', 'Lauren', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'mysterious', 'i', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'most', 'time', 'was', 'cell', 'mistery', 'leading', 'up', 'half', 'season', 'got', 'hooked', 'then', 'surprise', 'vaughn', 'wife', 'made', 'stay.However', 'true', 'were', 'few', 'mistakes', 'way', 'relationship', 'syd', 'vaughn', 'looks', 'classic', 'sope', 'opera', 'kathya', 'jack', 'relationship', 'ridiculous', 'as', 'well', 'barnett', 'slone', 'yes', 'story', 'leading', 'up', 'end', 'season', 'was', 'bit', 'stronger', 'season', '2', 'most', 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'season', 'are', 'who', 'saw', 'tv', 'season', 'be', 'watched', 'certan', 'fludity', 'continuty', 'order', 'appreciate', 'best.Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'who', 'say', 'was', 'wreck', 'more', 'similar', '1st', 'season', 'was', 'perfect', 'second', 'one']",Alias - The Complete Third Season
807286,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0001I55ZQ,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[5, 8]","I agree with most other reviewers, this season had no big storyline, losing 2 characters, and having Melissa George come into the equation. Oh well, at least we can see that an Australian soapstar can move into Hollywood.But what really is wrong with the storylines sliding, is down to the director. By this time he was also working on Lost, and Alias was never that popular in America, as I've read, and didn't get much of a following over here in the UK. I only remember seeing it on once, but it promptly seemed to disappear. Plus, on both sides of the Atlantic, there's been two new TV shows to take over - Lost & Desperate Housewives. (The latter I've never seen yet.) Alias gets lost, slides down the ratings, and gets moved to different times and days.Also, as we all know, Jennifer Garner also recently had a baby with a certain Mr Affleck...Back to the series. After ending season 2 on a terrific cliffhanger, we find out what happens to Sydney during the two years she actually disappeared, and was presumed dead. We find out Vaughan has got married, to Lauren, who hates Sydney upon sight. Her storyline spins out of control through the whole series, with so many twists, before she finally hooks up with Sark. He was a regular character during the second season, but becomes moreso this season, complete with shaved head (as did Will, when he came back for a couple of episodes.)There's something wrong with the final episode though. My dad & me actually sat through with our jaws hitting the floor. There are so many plotholes it's unbelievable. Someone was definitely smoking something when they came up with the storylines at the end. It was almost stupid to the point of switching it off. And I've thought before, there's some very similar ideas to what happens in the Mission: Impossible movies. Even moreso in this last episode, but it does not work.But it does end on a surprising cliffhanger.I've got season 4 waiting to be watched, still sealed, but I want to put it off for a while, as I still want to get season 5, when it gets released on DVD, but that will be quite a while yet. I probably won't be able to resist opening season 4, but I'm disappointed to read that Michael Vartan gets killed off as Vaughan. Help!!!As always, the guest stars are back, including brand new ones, and some previously seen. Vivica Fox comes back, and a very serious Ricky Gervais - why do I have the feeling that not many Americans have a clue who he is? (But he's hilarious in one of the extras!) Djimon Hounsou appears in two or three episodes, Pruitt Taylor Vince appears briefly, so does David Cronenberg in 2 episodes (who my Dad noticed as I had no idea who he was), the 'voice' of Quentin Tarantino is in one episode, and he appears in the flesh in another, Isabella Rossellini (with shockingly short hair), and Arnold Vosloo.As always, the blooper reel included in the extras is excellent, much like season 2. You end up watching them totally mess up lines, or just goof about. It's hilarious!I'm looking forward to watching season 4, although I hope it's slightly better than this one. Hopefully the Ramboldi storyline will be done & dusted - I'm sick of that.",3,Starting to slide,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,3175,"['agree', 'most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'season', 'had', 'big', 'storyline', 'losing', '2', 'characters', 'having', 'Melissa', 'George', 'come', 'equation', 'Oh', 'well', 'least', 'can', 'see', 'Australian', 'soapstar', 'can', 'move', 'Hollywood.But', 'what', 'really', 'wrong', 'storylines', 'sliding', 'down', 'director', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'working', 'Lost', 'Alias', 'was', 'never', 'popular', 'America', ""'ve"", 'read', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'following', 'here', 'UK', 'only', 'remember', 'seeing', 'once', 'promptly', 'seemed', 'disappear', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'been', 'two', 'new', 'TV', 'shows', 'take', 'over', 'Lost', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'latter', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'yet', 'Alias', 'lost', 'down', 'ratings', 'moved', 'different', 'times', 'days.Also', 'know', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'also', 'recently', 'had', 'baby', 'certain', 'Mr', 'Affleck', 'Back', 'series', 'ending', 'season', '2', 'terrific', 'cliffhanger', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Sydney', 'two', 'years', 'actually', 'disappeared', 'was', 'presumed', 'dead', 'find', 'out', 'Vaughan', 'got', 'married', 'Lauren', 'who', 'Sydney', 'sight', 'storyline', 'control', 'whole', 'series', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'finally', 'up', 'Sark', 'was', 'regular', 'character', 'second', 'season', 'moreso', 'season', 'complete', 'shaved', 'head', 'did', 'Will', 'when', 'came', 'back', 'couple', 'episodes', 'something', 'wrong', 'final', 'episode', 'My', 'dad', 'actually', 'sat', 'jaws', 'hitting', 'floor', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'plotholes', 'unbelievable', 'Someone', 'was', 'definitely', 'smoking', 'something', 'when', 'came', 'up', 'storylines', 'end', 'was', 'almost', 'stupid', 'point', 'switching', 'off', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'before', 'very', 'similar', 'ideas', 'what', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'movies', 'Even', 'moreso', 'last', 'episode', 'not', 'work.But', 'end', 'surprising', 'cliffhanger.I', ""'ve"", 'got', 'season', '4', 'waiting', 'be', 'watched', 'still', 'sealed', 'want', 'put', 'off', 'while', 'still', 'want', 'get', 'season', '5', 'when', 'released', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'while', 'yet', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'resist', 'opening', 'season', '4', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'read', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'killed', 'off', 'Vaughan', 'Help', 'always', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'back', 'including', 'brand', 'new', 'ones', 'previously', 'seen', 'Vivica', 'Fox', 'back', 'very', 'serious', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'feeling', 'not', 'many', 'Americans', 'have', 'clue', 'who', 'hilarious', 'one', 'extras', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'briefly', 'so', 'David', 'Cronenberg', '2', 'episodes', 'who', 'Dad', 'noticed', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'was', ""'voice"", 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'one', 'episode', 'flesh', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'shockingly', 'short', 'hair', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo.As', 'always', 'blooper', 'reel', 'included', 'extras', 'excellent', 'much', 'season', '2', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'totally', 'mess', 'up', 'lines', 'just', 'goof', 'about', 'hilarious', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'season', '4', 'hope', 'slightly', 'better', 'one', 'Hopefully', 'Ramboldi', 'storyline', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'dusted', ""'m"", 'sick']",Alias - The Complete Third Season
807287,A2S8PPHVFGZ2LK,B0001I55ZQ,Melissa,"[1, 1]","So all in all I didn't hate Season 3 the way I often see others ranting on about it. However I also believe that's because I didn't have to wait week to week for answers, I could and practically did watch each episode back to back. I finished the entire season in approximately 2 days. I rate this 4 stars, because despite not living up to season 2's cliffhanger hype it's STILL one of the best TV shows out there.With a cliffhanger like the one in Season 2 you know there's big things about to go down, and the first half of season 3 didn't disappoint.The petty drama between Lauren, Vaughn and Syd was to be expected considering the situation, but luckily it takes a back seat to watching Sydney obsessively track down her lost 2 years. It was a lot of fun to me and FAR outweighed the silly dramas. Syd blowing up the car in the second episode has got to be one of the best action shots ever. Julia Thorne is Syd's ultimate alias. Loved her! And the memory recovery attempt/dreams episode was one of the most highly creative editing jobs I've seen on TV.A pet peeve I have with this season though was the absence of Will Tippin. (read: unimaginative writers wrote him off) Granted, I'm biased because he's been a favorite character of mine since day 1, but he always gave the show (and Sydney) a more grounded feel to me. A little bit of realness in Sydney's life considering all the high action drama. Supposedly the writers didn't think it was working having Will be part of the CIA, but frankly I couldn't get enough in season 2, he fit perfectly into their world! --- Besides, if I were to analyze Will as a character, I'd know there's no way on earth he would've just accepted Syd's death and marched right off to witness protection. Not after what happened to Danny and Francie. Those reporter/investigating instincts would've went into overdrive landing him right back in the middle of trouble alonside Jack. But that's just my personal idealization and I guess the writers had other things in mind.This season was also missing one other key charismatic player, IRINA DEREVKO. A few chats with Daddy Bistow here an there doesn't fill the void of the wildly mysterious and conniving Irina. Sadly it's all because they couldn't negotiate a contract with the actress. Her absence is starkly evident and she is missed.Anyway, it's a bit strange to think back on this 3rd season. Literally 1/2 way through it feels like a completely different show. In the second half of the season things get a little off course which is, I assume, why this season is so loathed among many of the fans. Watching post coital Sloane & Dr. Barnett or seeing Daddy Bristow swapping spit with Auntie Dereveko was never high on my Alias `wishlist of things to see', ever.Besides the cast absences I believe they messed up in 2 key places in this season. First was revealing everything to Sydney about her missing 2 years in one episode 1/2 way through the season and the second was initially bringing Lauren in as a Vaugn's goody-two-shoes wife just for the soap opera drama effect. It was lame and cheesy. If they wanted to pursue the ""love triangle of doom"" route, one was already forming between Syd, Will and Vaughn in season 2, why change it?In my opinion Lauren should've been seen as the `bad girl' all along. When I thought I could take no more of the soap opera ""love triangle of doom"" they switched things up and brought in Sark as evil-Lauren's ally. She and Sark sizzled up such a flat/stale storyline and I must admit I had WAY more fun watching Lauren and Sark take down the Covenant leaders and thwarting the CIA's plans than I did watching the angst between Syd and Vaughn *yawn*. But I guess on a show about the good guys trying to stop the bad guys it's not really ideal that the writers had managed to get me to cheer on the bad guys. It's a shame they couldn't have made it work by letting us root for both Syd/Vaughn and Sark/Lauren. (boo!)Oh and I almost forgot, Sydney's sister... sadly there's no substance to her right now, and as you can tell, she's a fairly forgettable character. Maybe she'll be more interesting in season 4, but for now I coudn't care less about her. She truly does feel like yet another Rambaldi Artifact (read: plot device) and not an actual character.The cliffhanger for season 3 also left much to be desired, but I don't think anything will ever top Season 2's cliffhanger so anything else would pale in comparison.",4,"Highly enjoyable, but admittedly not ast good as season 1 & 2",1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,4448,"['So', 'did', ""n't"",

807288,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0001I55ZQ,Mitch Weaver,"[8, 12]","The third season of Alias picks up right where the second left off with Sydney waking up in Asia two years after the events in season 2, with no memory of how or why she got there. When Sydney makes it safely into CIA custody, she learns that fellow CIA agent and boyfriend Michael Vaughn( Michael Vartan)thought Sydney was dead,and moved on to marry another woman named Lauren Reed(Melissa George), her father Jack Bristow( Victor Garber) is in prison, Dixon( Carl Lumbly) is now the director of the CIA office she worked for, and her greatest enemy Sloan ( Ron Rifkin)is now a changed man who is running one of the most respected charity organizations in the world. Sydney manages to get Jack released, only to discover through videotape evidence from Jack that Sydney murdered a man in cold blood during the mysterious two years of her life that she went missing. This would begin the chain reaction of events for the rest of season 3 which include Sydney finding out who took the two years from her life and what happened during that time, as well as fighting her feelings for Vaughn.I have been a huge fan of Alias for the last three years, and I have never missed a single episode. The first season of Alias provided for an original, sexy, and fresh spy thriller that was packed full of great action and dialogue. The second season of Alias managed to somehow be even better, and had an outstanding cliffhanger that left fans of the show feeling anxious to find out what happens. Season 3 did have a lot of momentum going in. But with Vaughn being married to the unlikeable Lauren Reed, and Sloan offering no suspense as a changed man, season 3 could not seem to find the same rythm as the previous two seasons. However, after the initial speedbump in the beginning of the season, season 3 still manages to offer plenty of twists, action, suspense, great cliffhangers, and the sexy Jennifer Garner. Overall, fans of the show will still be satisfied for the most part. The only problem, is that the first two seasons set the bar so high, that season 3 could just not go any higher.The DVD package itself still manages to live up to its predecessors however.

I think the show (and I could be speaking very prematurely here as JJ Adams is a genius on Whedon scale and could pull the show back to greatness) really jumped the shark in the second season when it killed off Francie and got rid of Will.  They were really the ones that I enjoyed and I found myself particularly watching the scenes when Syd was just being Syd and interacting with her friends.  What made the show great was the balance between her spy life and her real life and the fact that the show as like James Bond but more human and complex.Season 3 devolved into Sydney crying every episode, Jack doing all the dirty work to protect his precious, weak little Syd, the Rambaldi arc getting out of control and lots of little side stories that were just naff.  I'm sorry but seeing a topless Ron Rifkin (I think the actor and character is genius though) made me gag ever so slightly.  I did enjoy Jack getting it on with Isabella Rosselini who I hope shows up again in Season 4 (""I think you're hot Jack, deal with it""  I love it!)  And the long-lost sister storyline was pretty much the nail in the meandering, nonsensical coffin that was Season 3.  Now that Greg Grunberg is getting his own series (yet another JJ brainchild), Sydney will have no friends and it'll be the Spy, Spy Daddy, Spy Boyfriend and Spy Partner (Dixon, whose character was just shelved and ruined by making him director of the Rotunda).  Bring back the Francinator and make her a big baddy instead of Sark's henchgirl/bed buddy!  I don't agree with the Amazon reviewer that Melissa George was lackluster but I think she could have had more luster.

807295,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B0001I55ZQ,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[4, 5]","At the beginning of season three of ""Alias,"" Sydney Bristow is supposedly ""back from the dead"" after two years of being gone, with many changes having taken place while she was away, and she is re-instated to CIA work almost immediately. I found this quite implausible, as I'd imagine the intelligence community would have at least a few pointed questions for her about her whereabouts for the last two years, which she can't remember at all.This is one example of a number of problems that plagued this season of ""Alias."" The problem with season three isn't suspense or action -- there's still plenty of both to be had here. However, in an effort to keep it moving the writers seem to have overlooked a few gaping plot holes right off the bat, and this occurs several times through the story.Mind you, there are some truly standout episodes in this season too. The danger of the Alliance has been replaced by a new, more sinister organization: the Covenant. Rambaldi artifacts continue to play a major part, and get more and more complex as the story progresses. Both Sydney and Vaughn go through some pretty significant character changes for this season, and where some found this a letdown, I found it refreshing, especially in Vaughn's case. Michael Vaughn was a character who was languishing in the world of being the eternal ""boy scout,"" and finally in this season we start seeing a different side of him peeking out.The special effects of the series are definitely getting better, and the situations (and the costumes!) Sydney gets herself into are just as outlandish as ever. This has always been part of the fun in this show, and they definitely keep that aspect going here.The surprising guest stars continue to crop up as well, including Djimon Hounsou of ""Gladiator"" fame, Vivica A. Fox, and a repeat appearance of Quentin Tarantino reprising his role from the first season. Meanwhile the tried and true folks, such as Ron Rifkin, Victor Garber, and the impressive Jennifer Garner continue to light up the screen. This season I have developed a real liking for Jack Bristow, Victor Garber's character, and was glad to see that Greg Grunberg got more screen time as Eric Weiss, perhaps the most geuninely likable character in the show.All in all, this third season of ""Alias"" suffers a bit because the writers are overreaching a tad. There are a few times when the story seems to get out of control and the resulting effects on the characters are, to be kind, implausible. I would have liked to have seen more of the tight, carefully-written aspects of the first two seasons. But despite this, ""Alias"" is still the most addictive show on television these days, and I look forward to the fourth season (starts in January!) anxiously.  In the commentary on the third season discs, Abrams says that the developments in the third season will have a larger effect on the story as a whole, and suggests that seeming inconsistencies will be explained. The man has definitely earned enough of my respect that I feel I can trust him to make good on that promise.Just keep it rolling, that's all I ask.",4,Rock and Roll,1099872000,"11 8, 2004",2004,3103,"['beginning', 'season', 'three', 'Alias', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'supposedly', 'back', 'dead', 'two', 'years', 'being', 'gone', 'many', 'changes', 'having', 'taken', 'place', 'was', 'away', 're-instated', 'CIA', 'work', 'almost', 'immediately', 'found', 'quite', 'implausible', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'intelligence', 'community', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'few', 'pointed', 'questions', 'whereabouts', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'all.This', 'one', 'example', 'number', 'problems', 'plagued', 'season', 'Alias', 'problem', 'season', 'three', ""n't"", 'suspense', 'action', 'still', 'plenty', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'However', 'effort', 'keep', 'moving', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'overlooked', 'few', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'right', 'bat', 'several', 'times', 'story.Mind', 'are', 'truly', 'standout', 'episodes', 'season', 'too', 'danger', 'Alliance', 'been', 'replaced', 'new', 'more', 'sinister', 'organization', 'Covenant', 'Rambaldi', 'continue', 'play', 'major', 'part', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'complex', 'story', 'Sydney', 'Vaughn', 'go', 'pretty', 'significant', 'character', 'changes', 'season', 'where', 'found', 'letdown', 'found', 'refreshing', 'especially', 'Vaughn', 'case', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'was', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'languishing', 'world', 'being', 'eternal', 'boy', 'scout', 'finally', 'season', 'start', 'seeing', 'different', 'side', 'peeking', 'special', 'effects', 'series', 'are', 'definitely', 'getting', 'better', 'situations', 'costumes', 'Sydney', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'outlandish', 'ever', 'always', 'been', 'part', 'fun', 'show', 'definitely', 'keep', 'aspect', 'going', 'here.The', 'surprising', 'guest', 'stars', 'continue', 'crop', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'Gladiator', 'fame', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'repeat', 'appearance', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'reprising', 'role', 'first', 'season', 'Meanwhile', 'tried', 'true', 'folks', 'such', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'impressive', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'continue', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'season', 'have', 'developed', 'real', 'liking', 'Jack', 'Bristow', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'character', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Greg', 'Grunberg', 'got', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Eric', 'Weiss', 'perhaps', 'most', 'geuninely', 'likable', 'character', 'show.All', 'third', 'season', 'Alias', 'bit', 'writers', 'are', 'overreaching', 'tad', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'story', 'get', 'control', 'resulting', 'effects', 'characters', 'are', 'be', 'kind', 'implausible', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'tight', 'carefully-written', 'aspects', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Alias', 'still', 'most', 'addictive', 'show', 'television', 'days', 'look', 'forward', 'fourth', 'season', 'January', 'anxiously', 'commentary', 'third', 'season', 'discs', 'Abrams', 'developments', 'third', 'season', 'will', 'have', 'larger', 'effect', 'story', 'whole', 'seeming', 'inconsistencies', 'will', 'be', 'explained', 'man', 'definitely', 'earned', 'enough', 'respect', 'feel', 'can', 'trust', 'make', 'good', 'promise.Just', 'keep', 'rolling', 'ask']",Alias - The Complete Third Season
807296,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0001I55ZQ,Robert Moore,"[39, 53]","OK, like 99% of all ALIAS fans, I will agree that Season Three is the weakest of the three to appear so far.  Having said that, it was still one of the most interesting shows on TV, and at no point was it anything less than riveting television.  Personally, I respect J. J. Abrams and the rest of the production staff for being willing to take some genuine risks with the show.  I'm sick of shows that merely crank out the same old product week after week and year after year (another season of LAW AND ORDER, anyone?).  I love the fact that Abrams and the others were willing to shake things up, push the edge, and take some risks.  OK, so a lot of them didn't pan out, but at least they tried.  Apart from ANGEL, of how many shows in the 2003-04 season could that be said?Even Abrams admits that many things did not go well in Season Three.  Melissa George's (whom I previously had primarily known as the Jenny, the daughter of Terence Stamp's character in THE LIMEY:  the film memorably begins over a black screen with Stamp urging, ""Tell me!  Tell me about Jenny!"") character of Lauren is widely hated, primarily because she separates Sydney and Vaughan for an entire season.  More troubling to me was the loss of Lena Olin (apparently more because she was simply not interested, than because of money quibbles), which robbed the show of the single greatest addition of Season Two, as well as the complete loss of ""Sydney at home.""  Hopefully in Season Four we will get more moments with Sydney eating ice cream, watching TV, reading a novel, hanging with friends.  About the only scene all season like this was the great time when Sydney and Weiss sit in her apartment and empty a bottle of tequila doing shots.  We could have used a whole lot more of that (as well as more of Weiss as a friend--he would have helped make up for the incredible loss of Will in Season Three, though I've read that he is going to be back to some degree in Season Four, and hopefully not merely as a guest).Still, a huge number of things went well in Season Three.  The missions were consistently exciting, most of them doing a marvelous job of advancing the plot.  Arvin Sloane managed to emerge as an even more complex and difficult to comprehend character, apparently having undergone a moral conversion of sorts.  For the greater part, the stunning reappearance of Sydney after having been missing for two years was masterfully handled, and occasioned some truly shocking moments.  And although I have never been much of a fan of the Reynaldo Rambaldi aspects of the show (which always seems to edge the show a bit away from being James Bond in a skirt and further towards INDIANA JONES or TOMB RAIDER), that theme does manage to generate many of the crucial plot turns and is well integrated into the rest of the story.  I'm not as enamored of the new bad guy outfit, The Covenant, but it does bring the ever evil Sark back into the story, and provides the occasion for a great appearance by the great African actor Djimon Hounsou as an especially ruthless bad guy.Season Three also is probably more overtly critical of a presidential administration than any series in the history of American television.  Forget the Covenant; for the first half of the season the bad guys are members of the Bush administration.  Lindsey, a National Security Council director whose immediate boss (an obvious, if unstated, point) is Condleezza Rice and who is said to be a golf buddy of the president, embodies all the worst possibilities of abuse under the Patriot Act.  Lindsey gleefully ignores the writ of habeas corpus, and routinely tosses people into jail and throws away the key.  He also embodies the lack of accountability and openness that has reached an apex in this administration.  And given that the CIA has been almost openly at war with the Bush team, this fits even closer with the theme of the show.  The first half of the season, before Lindsey's assassination, mirrors Sydney's angry words to him in a men's bathroom:  ""Go ahead, give me an object lesson in the abuse of power.""

Everyone involved continued to push the envelope, did their best to go further, and despite the disappointments still managed a stunning season.

However, some of the plot changes were really good - Vaughn's being married, Sloane's new ideology - but most of the story lines were just lame. It was so convenient that Lauren turned out to be bad because then, despite Vaughn's attraction to Sydney and their kiss, he could not come out as the bad guy. It would have been much more interesting if Lauren had not joined ""the dark side of the force"", because then Vaughn's character would have had to make a choice.

807298,A30X7VQZILMFZT,B0001I55ZQ,Sertorius,"[8, 11]","Frankly in previous seasons I sometimes found it distracting when Sydney returned to her secret identity and interacted with her friends.  I didn't realize how important it was until I watched Season 3 and realized how of Sydney's 'real' character only came out in these interactions.  Without this and without the amazing range of emotions provoked in the last season by her mother, Sydney anf the show that revolves around her seemed less than they had previously.  Perhaps to compensate there was an attempt to raise the level of the action and a greater reliance on flashly gadgets and special effects.  But without the human element of the show it simply became too difficult to maintain my suspension of disbelief.This season begins where the Season 2 finale ended, with Syd discovering that she has been presumed dead by her friends, family and colleagues for 2 years.  She has no recollection of this period, which drives her on a crusade to recover her lost memories.  Along the way she discovers that her world has changed in her absense &#60;SPOILER WARNING&#62;; her partner Dixon is now an adminstrator at the CIA; her father is in prison (though she quickly manages his release and reinstatement); her mother has disappeared without a trace; her friend Will is in witness protection; the villainous Sloane has become a philanthropist and ally of the CIA (and if you believe that I have a great bridge for sale); and most traumatically her beloved Vaugh has moved on and remarried (which has dire consequences throughout the season).  &#60;END SPOILER&#62; This is all very interesting, but some of it is gratuitous and some of it just plain doesn't work (the Vaughn situation in particular), leading to later attempts at triage that just muddy the waters further.  There are some exciting developments on the Rambaldi front, and an effective new villainous organization called the Covenant, but it is all built on the shaky foundation of Syd's shattered life and growing obsession.  Basically, I believe that this was a problem of implementation. The season had the required elements to still be great, but there was a failure of vision from the top down about the important emotional and character driven elements of the show.  J.J. Abrams has virtually admitted this in interviews and seems to have some good ideas to revive the franchise next season.

But as you probablly know all three of those shows have been over for well over a year (atleast populars been over for a couple years).  So I was looking for another show to fill in the void, and the void was filled by the of the best looking, action packed, Plot Thickend, Spy Series I have ever seen: Alias.  I was first introduced to Alias via watching the pilot episode of the series.  I liked the series, but due to school and other things I never really got to watch it (and if you know the show you'll know that if you miss an episode, you might as well give up on the rest of the season).But then about 9 months ago I purchased the first season DVD.  I watched that puppy in 6 days!!! (Thats a record for me, it usually takes like 2/3 weeks to finish of a TVSet).  And then I was hooked, but so I started to Tape the Third season of of ABC, while watching for Season two.Now that I have seen all three seasons I can't wait for the Alias Marathon I have planned for September, because Alias is one of the greatest shows (next to Buffy), but if you don't believe me, this is what a review for the pilot said: ""is ""a spy-fi roller coaster of killer gadgets, double roundkicks, triple crosses, poignant confessionals, cliff-hangers, sliced-off fingers, conspiracies, outrageous outfits, exotic locales, flirtations, mythologies - and that's just before the first commercial break.""",5,J.J Abrams the Next Whedon?,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,1519,"['When', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'were', 'three', 'shows', 'always', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Popular', 'probablly', 'know', 'three', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'year', 'atleast', 'populars', 'been', 'couple', 'years', 'was', 'looking', 'show', 'fill', 'void', 'void', 'was', 'filled', 'best', 'looking', 'action', 'packed', 'Plot', 'Thickend', 'Spy', 'Series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Alias', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Alias', 'watching', 'pilot', 'episode', 'series', 'liked', 'series', 'due', 'school', 'other', 'things', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'watch', 'know', 'show', ""'ll"", 'know', 'miss', 'episode', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'up', 'rest', 'season', 'then', '9', 'months', 'purchased', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'watched', 'puppy', '6', 'days', 'record', 'usually', '2/3', 'weeks', 'finish', 'TVSet', 'then', 'was', 'hooked', 'so', 'started', 'Tape', 'Third', 'season', 'ABC', 'watching', 'Season', 'two.Now', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'seasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Alias', 'Marathon', 'have', 'planned', 'September', 'Alias', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'next', 'Buffy', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'review', 'pilot', 'said', 'spy-fi', 'roller', 'coaster', 'killer', 'gadgets', 'double', 'roundkicks', 'triple', 'crosses', 'poignant', 'confessionals', 'cliff-hangers', 'sliced-off', 'fingers', 'conspiracies', 'outrageous', 'outfits', 'exotic', 'locales', 'flirtations', 'mythologies', 'just', 'first', 'commercial', 'break']",Alias - The Complete Third Season

Somewhere along the way people actually believed it. And somewhere along the way someone has to come on here and tell you nothing could be farther from the truth. That is me. I'm only halfway through Season 3 but I simply can't sit around another minute and let someone pass up Season 3 based solely on misguided opinions.Season 3 marks a huge change in the show because of circumstance. I suppose I can conceive people not liking the change of characters through a radical shift in circumstance (Syd's disappearance) however to write a review proclaiming this show has declined because of it is simply untrue. Just like LIFE, the show moved on and it only adds to the drama, not detracts from it. How a person can say Season 3 is nothing more than ""a love triangle with guns"" must have not paid attention to Season Two (the one they gloat over, which I also love). That was a love triangle of a different sort between Sydney, Irina, and Jack Bristow... with guns. Replace that with Sydney, Lauren, and Micheal Vaughn and you have a beast of another shade, nothing more. Maybe not as strong, but certainly no less compelling.Add to that Syds memory loss/disappearance, Marshall's baby/gf, Dixons revenge, Sloanes ""apparent apathy"", Allisons return; shaken liberally, and you have a bonafied winner.

807305,A3OND36Q71G76D,B0001I55ZQ,W. Scott Heitman,"[7, 9]","I just finished season 3 of Alias...and am wondering ""What the HELL happened in the last scene?""...season 4 dvds won't be out for a while....grumble grumble.Anyway, I agree that season 3 wasn't as strong as season 2, but I enjoyed it more than season 1.  Season 1 (although I loved it as well) almost seems now like a prequel to the main attractions.  The parts of the show that suffered in season 3 were largely parts that I didn't care about.  I really don't care about ""Sydney and friends at home."", which there really isn't any of in this season.  If you really miss it that much, then watch half an episode, pause it, and go find a re-run of friends on tv....sadly, you can probably find these re-runs on SOME channel 24-7.  In addition, the new character simply isn't as interesting as the others.  We also have to deal with the absence of Sydney's mother in this season, and she is a large part of what made Season 2 great.However, I really care mostly about 3 things in Alias, and they remain nearly at season 2 levels:1. Characters- while I explained a couple of problems above, the returning characters are great.  Sloane gets even more interesting, Weiss and Marshall are further developed, and a couple of minor but interesting characters are introduced.2. Action Scenes/Missions- no slouching here....the missions, costumes, fights, etc. continue to be over the top, well scored, and fun to watch.3. MOST IMPORTANTLY...the PLOT- The plot for this season comes VERY close to season 2.  The middle is a little slow, but the beginning and end were great.  I watched the last six episodes in one sitting....something I have only previously done for 24.  The writers continue to be good at writing twists that make sense and manipulating viewer expectations.  There were several times where I thought the story had twisted in a way that would have invalidated some past events only to find out that the story was actually twisting a different way.  I really don't understand people that think this season had a fragmented story.  To me, the story continues to warp around revealing a larger, grander story with each season...things that didn't make sense 2 seasons ago make sense now...it's just....brilliant.  And I don't understand why everybody is tired of the Rambaldi stuff.  The Rambaldi story is the PERFECT frame for this type of show.  It enable endless opportunity for new important artifacts to race to and adds a slight supernatural edge to the show at times that can be really fun.  In fact, I think the Rambaldi storyline is one of the ways that Alias actually trumps 24.  24 is my favorite, but Alias has one long continous storyline...it doesn't even take a breath at the end of seasons.  When I heard that season 3 of Alias wasn't supposed to be as good as the others, I prepared for worst....it seems I was misled...the season was great (although uneven), and Alias continues to be one of the 4 best shows on tv (the others being 24, The Shield, and Lost).",5,I don't understand what people are complaining about...,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,2982,"['just', 'finished', 'season', '3', 'Alias', 'am', 'wondering', 'What', 'HELL', 'happened', 'last', 'scene', 'season', '4', 'dvds', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'out', 'while', '.grumble', 'grumble.Anyway', 'agree', 'season', '3', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'season', '2', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'season', '1', 'Season', '1', 'loved', 'as', 'well', 'almost', 'now', 'prequel', 'main', 'attractions', 'parts', 'show', 'suffered', 'season', '3', 'were', 'largely', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Sydney', 'friends', 'home', 'really', ""n't"", 'season', 'really', 'miss', 'much', 'then', 'watch', 'episode', 'go', 'find', 're-run', 'friends', 'tv', '.sadly', 'can', 'probably', 'find', 're-runs', 'SOME', 'channel', '24-7', 'addition', 'new', 'character', 'simply', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'others', 'also', 'have', 'deal', 'absence', 'Sydney', 'mother', 'season', 'large', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'Season', '2', 'great.However', 'really', 'care', 'mostly', '3', 'things', 'Alias', 'remain', 'nearly', 'season', '2', 'levels:1', 'Characters-', 'explained', 'couple', 'problems', 'returning', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'Sloane', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'Weiss', 'Marshall', 'are', 'further', 'developed', 'couple', 'minor', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced.2', 'Action', 'Scenes/Missions-', 'slouching', 'here', '.the', 'missions', 'costumes', 'fights', 'etc', 'continue', 'be', 'top', 'well', 'scored', 'fun', 'watch.3', 'MOST', 'IMPORTANTLY', 'PLOT-', 'plot', 'season', 'VERY', 'close', 'season', '2', 'middle', 'little', 'slow', 'beginning', 'end', 'were', 'great', 'watched', 'last', 'six', 'episodes', 'one', 'sitting', '.something', 'have', 'only', 'previously', 'done', '24', 'writers', 'continue', 'be', 'good', 'writing', 'twists', 'make', 'sense', 'manipulating', 'viewer', 'expectations', 'were', 'several', 'times', 'where', 'thought', 'story', 'had', 'twisted', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'invalidated', 'past', 'events', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'twisting', 'different', 'way', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'people', 'think', 'season', 'had', 'fragmented', 'story', 'story', 'warp', 'around', 'revealing', 'larger', 'grander', 'story', 'season', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', '2', 'seasons', 'ago', 'make', 'sense', 'now', 'just', '.brilliant', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'everybody', 'tired', 'Rambaldi', 'stuff', 'Rambaldi', 'story', 'PERFECT', 'frame', 'type', 'show', 'enable', 'endless', 'opportunity', 'new', 'important', 'artifacts', 'race', 'slight', 'supernatural', 'edge', 'show', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'fun', 'fact', 'think', 'Rambaldi', 'storyline', 'one', 'ways', 'Alias', 'actually', '24', '24', 'favorite', 'Alias', 'one', 'long', 'continous', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'breath', 'end', 'seasons', 'When', 'heard', 'season', '3', 'Alias', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'prepared', 'worst', '.it', 'was', 'misled', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'uneven', 'Alias', 'be', 'one', '4', 'best', 'shows', 'tv', 'others', 'being', '24', 'Shield', 'Lost']",Alias - The Complete Third Season

I didn't understand the reviewer that said this is the best season and it's packed with action?!This season barely shows all of the cool action scenes we saw on the last 2 seasons, Sydney barely kicks ass! And don't let me get started on the plot , which is quite boring compared to the last 2 seasons, they seem to recycle materials , just with new characters and that's another downer , all the cool characters were gone- her best friend francy and even her evil clone, will and her mother. The love triangle of Sydney, Vaughn and Lauren is quite lame too, it seems like a bad soap opera, they just go on and on and all they give is a good yawn!Sark is annoying too!I'm just waiting for this season to end so I can see what happenned.",2,THE WORST SEASON SO FAR!,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,762,"['What', 'Happenned', 'Alias', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'reviewer', 'said', 'best', 'season', 'packed', 'action', 'season', 'barely', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'saw', 'last', '2', 'seasons', 'Sydney', 'barely', 'ass', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'started', 'plot', 'quite', 'boring', 'compared', 'last', '2', 'seasons', 'seem', 'recycle', 'materials', 'just', 'new', 'characters', 'downer', 'cool', 'characters', 'were', 'gone-', 'best', 'friend', 'francy', 'even', 'evil', 'clone', 'will', 'mother', 'love', 'triangle', 'Sydney', 'Vaughn', 'Lauren', 'quite', 'lame', 'too', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'just', 'go', 'give', 'good', 'yawn', 'Sark', 'annoying', 'too', ""'m"", 'just', 'waiting', 'season', 'end', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'happenned']",Alias - The Complete Third Season
