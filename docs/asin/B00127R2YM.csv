1135522,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B00127R2YM,Michael Valdivielso,"[24, 25]","Moon Phase is a vampire anime.  Slightly light hearted, with some drama, romance, action and mystery.  Not really scary nor is it thrilling.  But still a solid good story with great, if sometimes even artistic, settings.  What really got me, besides the plot that seems well thought out, was the amount of star power in the English cast.  Luci Christian, Carrie Savage, and Caitlin Glass are in it.  But the two major stars of the piece is Monica Rial, who plays the main female character, and Colleen Chinkenbeard, who not only was part of the voice cast, but also helped write some of the episodes, was one of the ADR directors, and the line producer.  This really is a labor of love and should become a part of any anime library.  There are some extras but the 26 episodes are the meat and potatoes of the set.",5,"Vampires, ghosts and cat ears.",1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,813,"['Moon', 'Phase', 'vampire', 'anime', 'Slightly', 'light', 'hearted', 'drama', 'romance', 'action', 'mystery', 'Not', 'really', 'scary', 'thrilling', 'still', 'solid', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'sometimes', 'even', 'artistic', 'settings', 'What', 'really', 'got', 'plot', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'was', 'amount', 'star', 'power', 'English', 'cast', 'Luci', 'Christian', 'Carrie', 'Savage', 'Caitlin', 'Glass', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'stars', 'piece', 'Monica', 'Rial', 'who', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'Colleen', 'Chinkenbeard', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'part', 'voice', 'cast', 'also', 'helped', 'write', 'episodes', 'was', 'one', 'ADR', 'directors', 'line', 'producer', 'really', 'labor', 'love', 'should', 'become', 'part', 'anime', 'library', 'are', 'extras', '26', 'episodes', 'are', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'set']",Moon Phase: The Complete Series
1135523,AFV2584U13XP3,B00127R2YM,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[46, 46]","I bought this just last week and have found this series to be very entertaining while there are some dark episodes this was still a great show to watch.  I also found it amusing with the chemistry between Kouhei and Hazuki it was a mix between friendship,family camaraderie,and a little bit of romance. The romantic part between Kouhei and Hazuki was a little weird though even if Hazuki was a vampire of unknown age at the time it still looked like a junior high school girl trying to have a relationship with an adult man in his 20's. I will tell reviewers that there is no actual scene of any kissing or any physical romantic scenes between them except for the parts when she drinks blood from Kouhei's neck.  The video is widescreen format with 5.1 engilsh audio as well as 2.0 japanese audio the extras are pretty slim just some text-less intro and ending songs as well as some trailers. I felt that as I have always that Fumiation Films got an excellent cast of engilsh voice actors for this series as well as a superb japansese voice cast so if you are looking for a light-hearted with just a dash of drama,supernatural abilities,action,and light-romance anime than this series is the one you want to get...",5,"Great Light-Hearted,Action,Drama Vampire Anime",1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,1214,"['bought', 'just', 'last', 'week', 'have', 'found', 'series', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'are', 'dark', 'episodes', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'show', 'watch', 'also', 'found', 'amusing', 'chemistry', 'Kouhei', 'Hazuki', 'was', 'mix', 'friendship', 'family', 'camaraderie', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'romantic', 'part', 'Kouhei', 'Hazuki', 'was', 'little', 'weird', 'even', 'Hazuki', 'was', 'vampire', 'unknown', 'age', 'time', 'still', 'looked', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'trying', 'have', 'relationship', 'adult', 'man', '20', 'will', 'tell', 'reviewers', 'actual', 'scene', 'kissing', 'physical', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'parts', 'when', 'drinks', 'blood', 'Kouhei', 'neck', 'video', 'widescreen', 'format', '5.1', 'engilsh', 'audio', 'as', 'well', '2.0', 'japanese', 'audio', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'slim', 'just', 'text-less', 'intro', 'ending', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'felt', 'have', 'always', 'Fumiation', 'Films', 'got', 'excellent', 'cast', 'engilsh', 'voice', 'actors', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'superb', 'japansese', 'voice', 'cast', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'light-hearted', 'just', 'dash', 'drama', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'action', 'light-romance', 'anime', 'series', 'one', 'want', 'get']",Moon Phase: The Complete Series

I found this series to be quite entertaining and had me laughing a good deal of the time.My only complaint about the series was that they never faced the head vampire (her father) and the last episode in my opinion was total crap ... I had to forced myself to watch it just because it was the last episode.  Definitely not a good way to end a great anime series if you ask me (reminded me of the god awful ending to Neon Genesis Evangelion)..... loved the cat ears and the ghetto cat costume for avoiding the sunlight ... good stuff.,5,Fanastic Vampire Anime,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,629,"['definitely', 'not', 'Vampire', 'D', 'Trinity', 'Blood', 'worth', 'adding', 'anime', 'collection', 'found', 'series', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'had', 'laughing', 'good', 'deal', 'time.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'faced', 'head', 'vampire', 'father', 'last', 'episode', 'opinion', 'was', 'total', 'crap', 'had', 'forced', 'watch', 'just', 'was', 'last', 'episode', 'Definitely', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'end', 'great', 'anime', 'series', 'ask', 'reminded', 'god', 'awful', 'ending', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'loved', 'cat', 'ears', 'ghetto', 'cat', 'costume', 'avoiding', 'sunlight', 'good', 'stuff']",Moon Phase: The Complete Series
