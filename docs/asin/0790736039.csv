The good news is that this DVD has nothing cut out unlike the edited VHS version we have in Australia. The scenes that was missing in the Australian VHS version is where Henry escapes from Juniper Hills (where Pennywise's head turns into a dog's head), also a long discussion where the adult loser's club is talking about how the whole town is &quot;IT&quot;. Other than that there were also some scenes that ended before the music had stopped or screen had faded but luckily the DVD has all of the proper footage.The picture and sound quality is decent throughout the entire disc. The region 4 DVD is double-sided so it has part 1 of &quot;IT&quot; on one side of the disc and to watch part 2 of &quot;IT&quot; you have to flip the disc over (I'm assuming this is the same as the region 1 version). I'm not really too fond of double-sided DVD's as they're easier to scratch and such but I'm just telling you this in case you'd rather avoid them and such.Fans of &quot;IT&quot; shall enjoy the DVD.",5,I got region 4 but it's the same version as region 1,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,1104,"['DVD', 'just', 'average', 'TV', 'mini', 'series', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'even', 'get', 'commentary', 'track', 'good', 'news', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'cut', 'out', 'edited', 'VHS', 'version', 'have', 'Australia', 'scenes', 'was', 'missing', 'Australian', 'VHS', 'version', 'where', 'Henry', 'Juniper', 'Hills', 'where', 'Pennywise', 'head', 'dog', 'head', 'also', 'long', 'discussion', 'where', 'adult', 'loser', 'club', 'talking', 'how', 'whole', 'town', 'quot', 'IT', 'quot', 'Other', 'were', 'also', 'scenes', 'ended', 'music', 'had', 'stopped', 'screen', 'had', 'faded', 'luckily', 'DVD', 'proper', 'footage.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'decent', 'entire', 'disc', 'region', '4', 'DVD', 'double-sided', 'part', '1', 'quot', 'IT', 'quot', 'one', 'side', 'disc', 'watch', 'part', '2', 'quot', 'IT', 'quot', 'have', 'flip', 'disc', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'same', 'region', '1', 'version', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'too', 'fond', 'double-sided', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'easier', 'scratch', 'such', ""'m"", 'just', 'telling', 'case', ""'d"", 'rather', 'avoid', 'such.Fans', 'quot', 'IT', 'quot', 'shall', 'enjoy', 'DVD']",N/A
104183,A3QR5L4SG42380,0790736039,Aaron Dwight King,"[4, 13]","This movie starts out with a lot of promise, but is dogged by the same problem throughout it - its dual nature accentuates the weakness of half the film.Every second where the characters are children is chilling, unnerving and unsettling, with some sequences making you squirm and others making you jump.  The child actors vary between average and excellent, and none of their performances detract from the quality of the film.HOWEVER, whenever the characters are adults, terrible acting, corn-ball humour and dreadful special effects ""haunt"" the movie far more than Tim Curry's clown.  In fact, even the clown loses impact in these sequences, as Tim seems to have been given a script written by buffoons in these parts of the film.  The dreadful special effects include the WORST disembodied head in film history - talking (wait for it) from a BAR FRIDGE!  The acting is no better, with all the adults struggling to do anything with the very weak material on offer.  And, since the ending of the movie, which entails (go ahead and read it, when you watch it it's less painful if you know how bad it's going to be...) a gigantic fake spider with glowing green parts and a gross-out fisting to death of this creature.  Yes, this brilliant and mysterious clown that killed children and haunted adults was not some Gacy or some supernatural force, but A SPIDER!!!  Give up on this movie before you start it.I wish they had done this movie only with children - it would have been creepy and unresolved.  Unfortunately, like most of Stephen King's movie adaptations, it has a dreadful ending and camp acting. (Kubrick seemed to be the only director who has enough of a brain to convert text into images well, and he's gone now...)

Even though SOME things have to be cut out (the author was never stingy with words or overly long descriptions), but this allows the script writer and director to leave enough stuff in to allow them to follow the original story without having to make big changes in the plot line to cover up for things that had been cut out.This movie has stayed pretty much loyal to the original story - even though the order of events in the book has been changed (in the movie, we first see the kids' story, then the adults', while in the book both are told stage by stage - for every stage the adults go through, we see the kids' equivalent).

104187,AZSN1TO0JI87B,0790736039,A. Estes,"[1, 1]","Originally airing as a mini-series on the ABC channel, ""It"" is an adaptation of the popular Stephen King novel of the same name. Taking place in the fictional small town of Derry, Maine, the story concerns seven tightly-knit friends growing up in the 1960's who find themselves being stalked by an evil entity referred to only as It. It takes the form of Pennywise, a creepy looking clown that is likely to scare the pants off of anyone with even the slightest case of coulrophobia. Though they seem to vanquish the creature early on, they find themselves being drawn together thirty years later to yet again face their fears in hopes of redeeming themselves and saving their hometown.This nearly three-and-a-half-hour, almost-but-not-quite epic tale is delivered by director Tommy Lee Wallace, who made a name for himself in the 1980's by directing such genre sequels as ""Fright Night Part II"" and ""Halloween III - Season of the Witch."" While obviously working within the constraints of a major network, Wallace manages to milk just as much creepiness out of his flick as he does nostalgia for the characters and the time in which they originate from. Aiding the film greatly is an iconic performance by Tim Curry as Pennywise. While he's more of a wise-cracking Freddy Krueger type than the malevolent force of nature he's supposed to be, he's the one character that owns the film, and is instantly recognizable in his own right, even twenty years later.The film is fleshed out with a great cast, too. John Ritter and Annette O'Toole make up the best of the adult cast, while Jonathan Brandis and Seth Green are among the highlights of the younger cast. While most horror films fall victim to annoying kids, ""It"" is an anomaly in that its child-actors are more sympathetic, believable and interesting than their adult counterparts. Sure, the 60's back-drop helps, but you can't help but feel for these kids and their daily struggles. When it comes to the story of the adults, though, there's a bit too much melodrama, and the second half is where things get a bit soggy and start to lose focus. Capping off with one silly ending (see: goofy looking giant spider), ""It"" is a hardly perfect but solid adaptation of great material. Thankfully, its running-time breezes by rather easily, and as far as made-for-TV horror films, it doesn't get much better than this.",4,It's Good,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,2363,"['Originally', 'airing', 'mini-series', 'ABC', 'channel', 'adaptation', 'popular', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Taking', 'place', 'fictional', 'small', 'town', 'Derry', 'Maine', 'story', 'concerns', 'seven', 'tightly-knit', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', '1960', 'who', 'find', 'being', 'stalked', 'evil', 'entity', 'referred', 'only', 'form', 'Pennywise', 'creepy', 'looking', 'clown', 'likely', 'scare', 'pants', 'anyone', 'even', 'slightest', 'case', 'coulrophobia', 'seem', 'vanquish', 'creature', 'early', 'find', 'being', 'drawn', 'together', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'yet', 'again', 'face', 'fears', 'hopes', 'redeeming', 'saving', 'hometown.This', 'nearly', 'three-and-a-half-hour', 'almost-but-not-quite', 'epic', 'tale', 'delivered', 'director', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'who', 'made', 'name', '1980', 'directing', 'such', 'genre', 'sequels', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Part', 'II', 'Halloween', 'III', 'Season', 'Witch', 'obviously', 'working', 'constraints', 'major', 'network', 'Wallace', 'milk', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'creepiness', 'flick', 'nostalgia', 'characters', 'time', 'originate', 'Aiding', 'film', 'greatly', 'iconic', 'performance', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Pennywise', 'more', 'wise-cracking', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'type', 'malevolent', 'force', 'nature', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'character', 'film', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'own', 'right', 'even', 'twenty', 'years', 'later.The', 'film', 'fleshed', 'out', 'great', 'cast', 'too', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'make', 'up', 'best', 'adult', 'cast', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'Seth', 'Green', 'are', 'highlights', 'younger', 'cast', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'fall', 'victim', 'annoying', 'kids', 'anomaly', 'child-actors', 'are', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'believable', 'interesting', 'adult', 'counterparts', 'Sure', '60', 'back-drop', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'kids', 'daily', 'struggles', 'When', 'story', 'adults', 'though', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'melodrama', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'soggy', 'start', 'lose', 'focus', 'Capping', 'off', 'one', 'silly', 'ending', 'see', 'goofy', 'looking', 'giant', 'spider', 'hardly', 'perfect', 'solid', 'adaptation', 'great', 'material', 'Thankfully', 'running-time', 'breezes', 'rather', 'easily', 'as', 'far', 'made-for-TV', 'horror', 'films', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better']",N/A

104189,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,0790736039,Alejandro Cortes,"[1, 1]","""It"" is a made-for-TV movie, but don't let that fool you, because it's one of the best movie adaptations for a Stephen King's novel that I have ever seen. Usually his books are condensed and reduced to trashy, boring, low-budget movies, and that's unfair, because King is one of the most recognized writers in the genre (if not the ultimate writer in the genre).With the exception of movies like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"", among few others, ""It"" makes one of the best movie adaptations to a Stephen King's book. Of course, usually is better to read the book, than seen the movie based in the book, but let me ask you something: how long does it take you to read a page of a book? Between 1 to 3 minutes, right? So I don't understand when someone expects that a 1000 pages book should be completely adapted to screen. Nobody wants to see a movie with a length of 1000 minutes.Putting aside the obvious licenses that this movie takes to condense the book, ""It"" is a very compelling movie, specially the first part. All the kids did a splendid work in this movie, every single kid was able to reflect on screen emotions like fear, friendship, happiness and loneliness. As a matter of fact, the only grown-up whose performance was at the same level of the kid's performances, was Tim Curry as the evil Pennywise. Tim did a great job with his eyes, he really looks like a demonic clown, of course the make-up is great, but Curry did an outstanding job as the frightening Pennywise.The second part of ""It"" isn't as attractive and emotional as the first one, the movie starts to lose steam, but it's good enough to keep the audience interested in the story. ""It"" is a good adaptation, the kids are just amazing, Tim Curry as Pennywise is one of the best villains in a movie based in a Stephen King's book, the characters make a genuine connection with the audience (specially if you are a kid, like the characters in the first part), the music is chilling, and all that results in a good movie.",3,ONE OF THE BEST ADAPTATIONS TO A STEPHEN KING'S NOVEL,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,2016,"['made-for-TV', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Usually', 'books', 'are', 'condensed', 'reduced', 'trashy', 'boring', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'unfair', 'King', 'one', 'most', 'recognized', 'writers', 'genre', 'not', 'ultimate', 'writer', 'genre', 'exception', 'movies', 'Carrie', 'Shining', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'few', 'others', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'course', 'usually', 'better', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'let', 'ask', 'something', 'how', 'long', 'take', 'read', 'page', 'book', 'Between', '1', '3', 'minutes', 'right', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'when', 'someone', '1000', 'pages', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'completely', 'adapted', 'screen', 'Nobody', 'see', 'movie', 'length', '1000', 'minutes.Putting', 'obvious', 'licenses', 'movie', 'condense', 'book', 'very', 'compelling', 'movie', 'specially', 'first', 'part', 'kids', 'did', 'splendid', 'work', 'movie', 'single', 'kid', 'was', 'able', 'reflect', 'screen', 'emotions', 'fear', 'friendship', 'happiness', 'loneliness', 'matter', 'fact', 'only', 'grown-up', 'performance', 'was', 'same', 'level', 'kid', 'performances', 'was', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'evil', 'Pennywise', 'Tim', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'eyes', 'really', 'demonic', 'clown', 'course', 'make-up', 'great', 'Curry', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'frightening', 'Pennywise.The', 'second', 'part', ""n't"", 'attractive', 'emotional', 'first', 'one', 'movie', 'lose', 'steam', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'audience', 'interested', 'story', 'good', 'adaptation', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'amazing', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Pennywise', 'one', 'best', 'villains', 'movie', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'characters', 'make', 'genuine', 'connection', 'audience', 'specially', 'are', 'kid', 'characters', 'first', 'part', 'music', 'chilling', 'results', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

The book, It, is probably one of the best books he has ever written.  Yes it is long, about as long as his redone version of The Stand. The reason for this is the complexity of the storyline.  One chapter, then one section, leads to the next, growing more and more frightening and yet also funny, endearing, and charming.  I love the book and would give it five stars no holds bar.The movie.  Well the movie.  Its not bad, I mean it is not pathetically bad, at least the kid's part of it.  The kids fit the part and Pennywise is powerfully done.  The problem though is this, they spent too little time with the kids.  The heart of the novel was the kid's adventure...concluding with the grow up version of the kids and their climatic battle with the ""It"".What would have been good is if the producers had four nights worth of the movie.  Yes that doesn't work with tv executives because they are evil pointed hair bosses (forgive my mentioning someone from the Diblert comic strip).  Two days worth of the kid's story, two days worth of the adult version.  There would have been a whole better story.  The true complexity of the story would have been wonderful.The adult section is where the problem is found.  They are all, all, really really bad actors.  They stumble along as if trying to remember each and every word of the script.  They do not convey the power of the adult version of the characters. You may agree, you may not.If you dont want to read 1100 plus pages of a novel, then go have at the film in its cliff note version.  It has a few good scares, and I really like the kids part if nothing else.

Sheehan,"[2, 9]","The basic plot of IT is a group of kids come together to fight a monster lurking underneath the town, & come together again years later as adults to finish the job.  As the book is over 1000+ pages, & seeing as how this mini series is 3 hours, it was inevitable that things would be cut.The problem is, there is so much more to the book than just monster hunting.  All of the themes & character development in King's novel got cut.  The movie has extremely little of those things, so each scene is just one Pennywise encounter after another.  This, quite frankly, is rather boring.  The way King wrote the story was much more absorbing & riveting than whats shown in this.  In King's book, there are many, many scenes with the characters interacting, or descriptions of Derry & its history, so I think its much more frightening when Pennywise does show up.But apart from that, the adult actors are miscast & have no chemistry with each other.  To be fair, the story was totally rushed & had very little character development, so the actors didn't have much to work with, but its a problem because one of the themes in King's book is friendship.And of course, the movie is also ineptly made.  What is with the cheap TV style score?  It made it seem more cheesy than serious.  They don't even capture the mood & atmosphere of King's novel, & this awful score doesn't help.  The cinematography is bland & uninspired.  There are no interesting shots.  Oh, I also musn't forget the atrocious editing.  For instance, the close ups of Pennywise showing its ""scary"" teeth are so painful & cheesy to watch.  They don't mix in with the other shots in the scenes.I won't get into the awful special effects at the end either, other than to say since they changed so much of King's story they might as well changed the ending too.  This movie is not even close to being scary, & its like its supposed to be some bad parody of King's amazing book.On the positives, I will say Curry was good, albeit he played the role for laughs rather than scares.  I understand he's a clown, but he's much more scary in the book.  The child actors were well cast, & some of the scenes were faithful to the book.

When the town's children begin to disappear, it is up to a group of school friends known as ""The Loser Club"" to gather their courage and end It's reign of terror. Thirty years later, the evil returns, and the group is called back as adults to defeat the demon once and for all. IT is one of the single most horrifying viewing experiences in anyone's life. How many childhoods have been ruined by IT, and how many more must suffer at the hands of Pennywise the Clown? While this two-part television event is only a mild retelling of Stephen King's best-selling novel, it manages to produce some of the most disturbing images known to man. If you weren't already scared of clowns going into the film, you sure as hell will be going out. It is impossible to sleep at night knowing that the photo album, the sink, or even a friendly balloon are likely to sneak up on you and drench you in blood like they do in the film. IT perfectly captures childhood fears in a way that is still terrifying to adults. There are no words to describe just how frightening Tim Curry's performance is as the killer clown. He hides more menace in a smile than a snarl, and the nightmarish ways in which he lures children to their deaths can never be forgotten. The plot still plays well even after the the paring down of Stephen King's over-indulgent characters, though many of the performances often falter.

While I would not go so far as to call ""IT"" a horror movie, it definitely possesses some of the key ingredients of that type of film. And like with all Stephen King movies, we have a scary and interesting plot, fascinating characters, plenty of thrills, chills and spills and one downright creepy scary-as-hell villain in the form of Pennywise the Clown who has scared the pants off of me since I was 16 years old. This was also a made for tv movie like ""Storm Of The Century"" so it was not too horribly graphic and yet still scary enough to make me beware of clowns. The setting is a small Maine town where children are starting to disappear or wind up murdered. This was a two-part tv movie event and the first part shows a group of kids in the late 1950's who decide to take on the evil responsible for the missing and murdered children. The second part shows those kids who battled the evil returning 30 years later as adults to battle it again. The cast is an all-star one consisting mostly of veteran tv actors. The story is definitely creepy but not disturbing. Like ""Storm Of The Century"" this movie is entertaining and is a great example of a respectable scary movie that makes you want to snuggle up with a security blanket and maybe a loved one.

104238,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0790736039,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[60, 74]","Stephen King's It is my favorite novel of all time, and even though this miniseries adaptation of the book is done about as well as it could possibly be done, I can only give it four stars.  There are several reasons for this, the two most important being time and money.  The novel is an immense work, and no adaptation of three hours can even hope to do it true justice; even ten hours would not suffice for getting at the essence of the story, that essence being not horror at all but childhood.  The movie only allows the viewer to take in everything from outside, whereas the painstaking detail, insight, and atmosphere of King's novel make the reader an active participant in events.  Thus, a lot of things presented in the movie do not come off overwhelmingly convincingly, and there are more than a few noticeably sudden and seemingly unexplainable transitions even within single scenes alone.  The money issue is most evident at the end, as the special effects for the big finale were not very impressive even at the time of the movie's completion.  Special effects are not all-powerful, of course, but the B movie-ish visuals unveiled in the movie's climactic moments serve to break the spell of the viewer's suspended disbelief and introduce a touch of camp into a movie that should not really be about the big bad monster in the first place.The setting for this story is a familiar one to King fans, the disquietingly different town of Derry, Maine.  Something lives underneath the town, a malevolent force that adults cannot and will not believe in, but which seven outcast kids recognize, fear, and steel themselves to conquer back in 1960.  Thirty years later, the monster they hoped they had killed as children returns, and the one character who never left Derry realizes this and calls everyone back to fulfill the promise they all made to return and kill the thing if it ever came back.  The movie is, in a sense, two movies in one, as the action shifts between the parallel actions of the characters as children and as adults.  The main character, Bill Denbrough, is played by Richard Thomas, a casting decision I did not understand at the time and still fail to comprehend completely.  Thomas does a good job, but he is still Johnboy Walton to me, and I just have trouble believing a pony-tailed Johnboy is Bill Denbrough.  Harry Anderson and John Ritter are two additional big names lending their talent to the film, but the best adult performance is turned in by Annette O'Toole as Beverly Marsh, the group's sole female member.  As I have said, though, this story is really about childhood, and the child actors are the true stars.  Jonathan Brandis is young Bill Denbrough (and like his adult counterpart, just doesn't quite fit the bill as far as I'm concerned), Seth Green succeeds much more ably in the role of Richie Tozier than his adult counterpart, Brandon Crane (whom Wonder Years fans will immediately recognize as good old Doug Porter) turns in a winning performance, and Emily Perkins shines as young Bev Marsh.  Tim Curry, it must be emphasized, was born to play Pennywise the Clown.The monster in It is a conglomeration of everything each individual is afraid of; he is in a very real sense the ultimate monster because he is everything you were ever afraid of.  The seven childhood friends who comprise The Losers' Club represent a cross-section of children everywhere: one stutters, one is a hypochondriac with an overprotective mother, one is the victim of child abuse, one uses comedy to hide his fears and to win acceptance, one is overweight, one is a paragon of logic and duty, and one is a black boy in a white community; all of them are outsiders and are tormented by a bully who ably represents all bullies everywhere.  Sadly, the movie does not make it possible for the viewer to really get to know these kids and to relive his/her own childhood alongside them.  A big problem with the adult actors is the fact that they oftentimes seem to be over-acting; I understand why this almost has to be so, however.  It is merely a sign of the intense emotions they must try to convey in a very limited amount of time and space.It remains one of King's better film adaptations, despite the problems inherent in its production.  No movie can capture the magic of the novel, however.  The only unfortunate thing about the movie is the fact that it comes off as primarily a horror movie.  Certainly, there is great horror lurking in this film as it progresses, but that is not the original story's essence and primarily for this reason the movie falls short of rating five stars in my opinion.",4,"Quite good, but it fails to convey the essence of the novel",1057622400,"07 8, 2003",2003,4630,"['Stephen', 'King', 'favorite', 'novel', 'time', 'even', 'adaptation', 'book', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'done', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'being', 'time', 'money', 'novel', 'immense', 'work', 'adaptation', 'three', 'hours', 'can', 'even', 'hope', 'do', 'true', 'justice', 'even', 'ten', 'hours', 'would', 'not', 'suffice', 'getting', 'essence', 'story', 'essence', 'being', 'not', 'horror', 'childhood', 'movie', 'only', 'viewer', 'take', 'everything', 'outside', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'insight', 'atmosphere', 'King', 'novel', 'make', 'reader', 'active', 'participant', 'events', 'Thus', 'lot', 'things', 'presented', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'overwhelmingly', 'convincingly', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'noticeably', 'sudden', 'seemingly', 'unexplainable', 'transitions', 'even', 'single', 'scenes', 'alone', 'money', 'issue', 'most', 'evident', 'end', 'special', 'effects', 'big', 'finale', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'impressive', 'even', 'time', 'movie', 'completion', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'all-powerful', 'course', 'B', 'movie-ish', 'visuals', 'unveiled', 'movie', 'climactic', 'moments', 'serve', 'break', 'spell', 'viewer', 'suspended', 'disbelief', 'introduce', 'touch', 'camp', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'big', 'bad', 'monster', 'first', 'place.The', 'setting', 'story', 'familiar', 'one', 'King', 'fans', 'disquietingly', 'different', 'town', 'Derry', 'Maine', 'Something', 'town', 'malevolent', 'force', 'adults', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'believe', 'seven', 'outcast', 'kids', 'recognize', 'fear', 'steel', 'conquer', 'back', '1960', 'Thirty', 'years', 'later', 'monster', 'hoped', 'had', 'killed', 'children', 'returns', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'left', 'Derry', 'everyone', 'back', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'made', 'return', 'kill', 'thing', 'ever', 'came', 'back', 'movie', 'sense', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'action', 'shifts', 'parallel', 'actions', 'characters', 'children', 'adults', 'main', 'character', 'Bill', 'Denbrough', 'played', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'casting', 'decision', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'time', 'still', 'fail', 'comprehend', 'completely', 'Thomas', 'good', 'job', 'still', 'Johnboy', 'Walton', 'just', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'pony-tailed', 'Johnboy', 'Bill', 'Denbrough', 'Harry', 'Anderson', 'John', 'Ritter', 'are', 'two', 'additional', 'big', 'names', 'lending', 'talent', 'film', 'best', 'adult', 'performance', 'turned', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'Beverly', 'Marsh', 'group', 'sole', 'female', 'member', 'have', 'said', 'though', 'story', 'really', 'about', 'childhood', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'true', 'stars', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'young', 'Bill', 'Denbrough', 'adult', 'counterpart', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'bill', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Seth', 'Green', 'much', 'more', 'ably', 'role', 'Richie', 'Tozier', 'adult', 'counterpart', 'Brandon', 'Crane', 'whom', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'fans', 'will', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'good', 'old', 'Doug', 'Porter', 'winning', 'performance', 'Emily', 'Perkins', 'shines', 'young', 'Bev', 'Marsh', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'must', 'be', 'emphasized', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Pennywise', 'Clown.The', 'monster', 'conglomeration', 'everything', 'individual', 'afraid', 'very', 'real', 'sense', 'ultimate', 'monster', 'everything', 'were', 'ever', 'afraid', 'seven', 'childhood', 'friends', 'who', 'comprise', 'Losers', 'Club', 'represent', 'cross-section', 'children', 'everywhere', 'one', 'stutters', 'one', 'hypochondriac', 'overprotective', 'mother', 'one', 'victim', 'child', 'abuse', 'one', 'comedy', 'hide', 'fears', 'win', 'acceptance', 'one', 'overweight', 'one', 'paragon', 'logic', 'duty', 'one', 'black', 'boy', 'white', 'community', 'are', 'outsiders', 'are', 'tormented', 'bully', 'who', 'ably', 'bullies', 'everywhere', 'Sadly', 'movie', 'not', 'make', 'possible', 'viewer', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'kids', 'relive', 'own', 'childhood', 'big', 'problem', 'adult', 'actors', 'fact', 'oftentimes', 'seem', 'be', 'over-acting', 'understand', 'why', 'almost', 'be', 'so', 'however', 'merely', 'sign', 'intense', 'emotions', 'must', 'try', 'convey', 'very', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'space.It', 'one', 'King', 'better', 'film', 'adaptations', 'problems', 'inherent', 'production', 'movie', 'can', 'capture', 'magic', 'novel', 'however', 'only', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'movie', 'fact', 'off', 'primarily', 'horror', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'great', 'horror', 'lurking', 'film', 'not', 'original', 'story', 'essence', 'primarily', 'reason', 'movie', 'short', 'rating', 'five', 'stars', 'opinion']",N/A

104242,A2OMOO9PDZEVOG,0790736039,Darryl Fabia,"[4, 11]","To start things off honestly: ""It"" is probably one of the poorest book adaptions I've seen in quite some time. After reading the book and finding an extraordinary piece of writing, an amazing work of art, I was thrilled to see the movie. I knew it couldn't be all that the book was, but I hope for some semblance...And some semblance is what I got... and that's all. The deep, thoughtful construction that helped build the novel, where both the stories, the side of 1958 and the side of 1985 (the years are changed in the movie, but there's nothing wrong with that) are shown alternatingly, starting with 1958, moving ahead to 1985, and back again, creating a heartfelt atmosphere. The movie instead plays the older part in the first segment, as one full flashback that tries to cram way too many events into one bit, whereas they should have simply tried to organize their own way of telling, and the more recent events in the second half. It seems like every event in the children's section is segmented into 15 minute episodes, just trying to pile notable events in from the book, and it doesn't work. It might have worked better if they kept the construction that King originally established, but even then it would have hardly stood, as they took the events for no reason.And even with this chronological sorting, they seemed to actually forget scenes and had to tack them on later as additional flashbacks that had little to do with the scene, but desperately needed introduction earlier.Gone is the unifying theme of the group: They each escaped It. That's there, in a way, but it's moreover just tossed in for scares, and horribly stupid ones at that. Gone is the leper with the three-foot tongue that chased Eddie down the traintracks. Gone is any fear or tension when Bill rides off on his bike with Stan (it was Richie in the book, but that's not important...It's supposed to be a moment of escape, but they just simply ride away, ruining all reason for Silver to matter until the end, when the makers suddenly remembered that they needed it.And then, the worst two bastardizations. It's ok if Richie encountered a werewolf instead of a giant statue. It's ok if the scene with Georgie at the start was during the day, stealing what could have been a truly horrific scene (maybe cause it was made for TV, that lightened it.) It's ok if the whole point of Henry's return is gone (maybe not... but I'd have let it slide.) And it's ok that they cut out the kids being lost after first believing they killed It (definitely because of the made for TV movie... hell, even a theatrical movie... I don't see that scene, even in suggestion, ever reaching film if this movie were to be remade and I'm not going to reveal it, you'll just have to read the book.) And gone is the origin of It. No, those things are forgivable... let's get to what isn't.Personal Bastardization: I felt jipped when they finally confronted It and the whole deadlights business was dumbed down. It wasn't supposed to be hypnotic, it was a staring contest, that would eventually lead into the Ritual of Chud. This point is missed. And then the Turtle (don't ask, read) is also gone, losing the relation to the universe that Stephen King set up in the novel. It's no wonder that the scene of Patrick Hockstetter and his demented fridge (aside from it being made for TV and that scene would never be allowed), as the dealings of the Other weren't explored or even mentioned. I wanted to see how they portrayed the whole scene and they didn't even have it, which ruined the entire final confrontation at the end.Universal Bastardization: The vow to return. In this, they easily walk out of the sewer and look outward, where Bill has them promise to return. In the novel, they crawl from there, exhausted and bewildered. Instead, there is no forced promise; they do it themselves, cutting their palms with a glass Coke bottle and making a blood pact that they would return if It was still alive. And the meaning disappeared as well, but I won't get into why, for fear of telling too much of the book, which I truly hope the readers of this review will read.Ok, I suppose I should get onto why I let this have two stars instead of one if I hated what it had done to the book, right?There are some beautifully horrifying scenes, such as when Beverly exits her childhood home and sees a balloon bouncing down the road, laughing. The sharkteeth in Pennywise's mouth aren't used well, but they look scary. And there was the great scene when they were children, where they hold hands in a circle and Stan suddenly finds himself holding hands with the clown. The acting is decent for a TV Movie and there are a few notable celebrities.These few things aren't enough to make the movie good, and it really would only be scary for young children, who probably shouldn't be watching it anyway.With the same budget and time space, a decent movie of ""It"" could have been made. Instead, there's this trash. I can only hope that someday, there will be another version of this created, one that captures the emotion, atmosphere, and incredible imagination that formed Stephen King's masterpiece of a novel, ""It.""",2,It Has Become $@It,1063411200,"09 13, 2003",2003,5168,"['start', 'things', 'off', 'honestly', 'probably', 'one', 'poorest', 'book', 'adaptions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'reading',

104243,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,0790736039,David J. Brown,"[0, 0]","The second King t.v. mini series, but the first one to try and stay as truthful to the source novel as possible.  While I appreciated Tobe Hooper's rendition of Salem's Lot, I still felt the acting, production value, and alterations to the story were all too typical of television movies, plus it looked like it was filmed through a dirty cloth.  Stephen King's It was a big deal when it came out back in 1990, and though it was a lot scarier the first time I saw it when I was 9, I still feel it's an effective horror film in its own right.The first half of the story, the first night of two, is based on the main chracters' childhoods and their first and supposed final confrontations with the creature simply known as It.  It gets its name from the fact that it is an unknown supernatural being that can manifest or take the form of young kids' fears and nightmares.  One standout scene that is quite effective is the one involving a scared young girl desperately trying to clean blood from her bathroom sink but getting nowhere.  The preteens all play their roles quite well, especially Emily Perkings(Ginger Snaps 1-3) and Jonathan Brandis(Lady Bugs, Sea Quest).  The first half is set in the 50's and has that sweet and overly nostalgic feel with classic rock tunes and production design.  It sets things up for a surrene and nice setting and then we meet Pennywise, played brilliantly as funny and scary, by Tim Curry.  Pennywise takes the shape of the creepiest circus clowns you've ever seen.  King was smart for this one.  I mean, really, who the hell actually likes clowns?  The transitions from typical nostalgic fueled 50's to out-and-out terror and horror film conventions is very effective in this movie.The second half is littered with t.v. pedigree'd actors of the likes of John Ritter, Harry Anderson, Annette O'tool and Richard Thomas.  The second half of the tale, involving the older versions of the first half's characters, takes place 30 years after the end of the first night and unfortunately is less effective.  There are many reasons for this.  One of them being that we get very attached to the young performers in the first half, even though the first night lets us glimpse the older ones, that it's hard to lose them and their performances.  Not to slight the older performances at all.  John Ritter is a real stand out in this, though they all hit it out of the park in general.Other problems with the second half come in the form of the ending.  Though, we can't completely fault the filmmakers for this.  King wrote the ending that the film stays true to, but on the page a giant spider-like monster is a lot scarier in the imagination of the reader then it is on film visualised by special effects and one group of filmmakers'imaginations.  The special effects in this movie are really good though, especially when you take into consideration that it was made on a television budget and time schedule and in the early 90's!  That's one thing that horror fiction prose will always have over movies, the monster on the brain will always be scarier then the one on screen, no matter how well the speical effects are executed, CGI or other.Anyone who has read the novle know how very long it was and how long the epilogue runs on after the main climax has occurred.  The film, even at three hours, it's truncated for pace, time and content, content too violent or racy for t.v. viewrs in the 90's, especially on the family friendly ABC network.  Though, today I feel this is all kids stuff when compared to what's allowed to air on comercial t.v.  I really do miss the ritualistic thing the kids do before they fight the monster the first time in the book, though.  The film was co-written and directed by Tommy Lee Wallace(Halloween III, Fright Night part II), and co-written by Lawrence D. Cohen(De Palma version of Carrie).  Wallace came up in the film business working with horror royalty John Carpenter and he does a really good job on what must've been a monster undertaking with this film.  The tone is right and this is a straight horror film, no winking.  It moves fast, despite it's running time and it looks good.The DVD is a very good transfer and it's in Widescreen.  YAY and HOORAY!  I didn't even know this thing was filmed in widescreen, but I'm happy to have been able to see it that way, it's more filmic and less t.v.  Besides the great new widescreen transfer the only other special feature we get is an awesome commentary track by director Wallace and cast members John Ritter, Richard Thomas, Dennis Christopher and Tim Reid.  It's a lively and super informative commentary that goes everywhere from the history of the project, the casting process, the fights with standards and pracctices, the deviations from the novel, the things the actors didn't like aobut the film and the things that they did, and much much more.  I've listened to it twice since I've owneed this disc, it's really fun and worth checking out if you have this disc.This is a landmark t.v. mini-series for the medium and for Stephen King translations and adaptions, even though Salem's Lot came first. This film did it right and better first.  The only downfall about this DVD is the fact that it's a flipper.  One half of the series on each side.  Also, don't be fooled by the comedic line up of t.v. actors posted on the cover artwork.  They are all very good and appropriate in their respective roles.  Kudos to director Tommy Lee Wallace for having the foresight to know that all good comedy performers have a lot of darkness somewhere in their hearts.  About the cover artwork, I really wish that the orignal poster was used, the same one used for the hard cover novel, but we do get to glimpse it on the DVD menu.So, make some time and check it out, even if you have seen it already.",4,Stephen King review # 2,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,5813,"['second', 'King', 't.v', 'mini', 'series', 'first', 'one', 'try', 'stay', 'as', 'truthful', 'source',

The first half of the film is really quite good; the character development and the way they are each seperately introduced into the story is very well done.  The subtle appearences of Pennywise and other horrific appearences are staggered throughout.  This helps to build suspense, and make the film a bit more spooky. Tim Curry's portrayal as the sinister clown is very convincing, and it is possible to find him funny from time to time, but as the film unravels more, so does the plot and horror.  The film grows less and less scary, and the ending is just ridiculous.  Pennywise truely steals the show, and sometimes the other characters fall a little short.

Nevertheless, I did not see it at one sitting, I never do  these days. Despite the occasional breaks of half-hour, hour, as well as shorter times, I did get tired both of the sheer length but also of flashbacks and seven people each getting a segment to him/herself, besides reiteration of the imagery from those earlier scenes. Not being one who likes flashbacks under any circumstances, it got very trying. The fact that I remained interested in the film does say something for its merits. The children did a fine job as did the adults when their parts allowed it. The logic of the one suicide escaped me: that is, I understood why he did it, just didn't understand why the plot required him to do it.I should think fans of King would be satisfied; I give no credence to complaints from people (on any occasion) who have read the book and want a movie faithful to the book. Books are books and movies are movies: each has its own grammar, each has its own logic, each reaches the audiences mind and senses in different ways. If you want what is in the book, reread it. I didn't have that problem since I have never read a King book. The movie has the scary monster, the frightened victims and victims-intended, the victories and defeats of the good guys, what more can one ask. Non-fans, with the caveat I have offered about length and repetition, can find an interesting story with some good acting. Arranging to see it on successive days should reduce the tedium and increase the enjoyment. Certainly it is more of a general audience vehicle than the other King adaptations I have seen (though I have not come close to seeing them all).",4,WELL DONE BUT ALSO OVERDONE,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,1765,"['OK', 'fault', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'was', 'mini', 'series', 'when', 'bought', 'DVD', 'almost', 'dozen', 'years', 'was', 'issued', 'Nevertheless', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'one', 'sitting', 'never', 'do', 'days', 'occasional', 'breaks', 'half-hour', 'hour', 'as', 'well', 'shorter', 'times', 'did', 'get', 'tired', 'sheer', 'length', 'also', 'flashbacks', 'seven', 'people', 'getting', 'segment', 'him/herself', 'reiteration', 'imagery', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'Not', 'being', 'one', 'who', 'flashbacks', 'circumstances', 'got', 'very', 'trying', 'fact', 'remained', 'interested', 'film', 'say', 'something', 'merits', 'children', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'did', 'adults', 'when', 'parts', 'allowed', 'logic', 'one', 'suicide', 'escaped', 'understood', 'why', 'did', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'plot', 'required', 'do', 'it.I', 'should', 'think', 'fans', 'King', 'would', 'be', 'satisfied', 'give', 'credence', 'complaints', 'people', 'occasion', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'want', 'movie', 'faithful', 'book', 'Books', 'are', 'books', 'movies', 'are', 'movies', 'own', 'grammar', 'own', 'logic', 'audiences', 'mind', 'senses', 'different', 'ways', 'want', 'what', 'book', 'reread', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'King', 'book', 'movie', 'scary', 'monster', 'frightened', 'victims', 'victims-intended', 'victories', 'defeats', 'good', 'guys', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'one', 'ask', 'Non-fans', 'caveat', 'have', 'offered', 'length', 'repetition', 'can', 'find', 'interesting', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'Arranging', 'see', 'successive', 'days', 'should', 'reduce', 'tedium', 'increase', 'enjoyment', 'Certainly', 'more', 'general', 'audience', 'vehicle', 'other', 'King', 'adaptations', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'seeing']",N/A

Unfortunately the Stephen King novel was so long not everything in the book could be included in the tv mini-series otherwise the tv mini-series would have probably been a week long mini-series. I can understand why fans of the novel is not enamoured with the film unlike me.The storyline takes place in Derry, Maine. The small town is plagued by a series of mysterious killings of children by a monster that adults are unable (and in serious denial) to believe in. This monster comes in the form of the extremely creepy Pennywise the clown played by the brilliant Tim Curry who made me see clowns in a whole new light after seeing the film. Tim Curry's performance truly stood out for me. I still get the goose bumps whenever I come across ""It"" on cable tv.The protagonists of the story is a small circle of childhood friends who were considered outcasts by their peers and losers by a group of psychotic bullies. The cast is rounded out by Harry Anderson, John Ritter, Jonathan Brandis, Seth Green, Annette O'Toole, Richard Thomas, Tim Reid, Emily Perkins, Ben Heller, Olivia Hussey, and Dennis Christopher.The film begins with a phone call from Mike Hanlon (Tim Reid) to his friends when the killings begins again after their last encounter with Pennywise. While everyone had left Derry, Mike remained in town as the unofficial watcher of It. This is not a happy reunion to say the very least. The story goes between the past and present.I personally enjoyed the film adapation a lot. Yes it is a very condensed version of the novel but ya can't cram every single detail from the book into the film within a certain amount of time. Every scene with Tim Curry as Pennywise the clown sent the hairs on the back of my neck straight up, especially the opening sequence when he encounters Bill's younger brother George Denbrough. The confrontation between the grown up friends and the flesh eating spider was cheesy, if not laughable. Despite the obvious edits and cheesy confrontation, I still love ""It"".

I'm even related to such a person who's read the book several times and encouraged me to read it too.  I am happy to report that I did read the book.  However.  Far from being a page turner that I couldn't put down, it turned into a two year marathon where I had to force myself to finish reading it, a bit at a time.  I thought, with that bad experience well behind me, that I'd give this televised version a chance.  MMMM-yeah.  I'm sorry, I kept waiting impatiently for it to get scary.  Instead, I found it rather limp, devoid of any genuine fright whatsoever.  I suppose it didn't help I've never thought of clowns as being particularly spooky.  I was also under the impression that they, like mimes, were supposed to be silent; their act being one of slapstick and pantomime.  Pennywise the Dancing Clown was anything but silent; in fact, all he did was yap (I did find Tim Curry's performance hysterical, meant in a positive way, as he's the only good thing about this miniseries).  To make matters worse, I found it to be terribly dated.  The cast was also filled with odd choices, Olivia Hussey in particular.  Harry Anderson was loud, obnoxious, and phony; his performance forced.  On the other hand, his younger half, Seth Green, was very natural and likable.  The late Jonathan Brandis was poignant while his older counterpart, Richard Thomas, seemed consistently bewildered (the ponytail didn't help).  As a whole, the younger actors did far better than the adults did.

I remember first watching this when I was a sophomore in high school and getting scared senselessly with the demented imagination of Stephen King.  The mini-series (as condensed) as it had to be, pretty much stays faithful to the book. This is one of the few cases where I find myself enjoying the movie more than the book. After I saw &quot;It&quot;, I never saw clowns in the same light again. In fact, I now have a slight aversion to clowns, even Ronald McDonald with that bright orange-reddish hair. All I can see is Pennywise growling &quot;they all float down here&quot;. Obviously the standout performance in the movie has to go to Tim Curry with his spinetingling performance as the clown from hell Pennywise who really is this spider-like beast who feeds on children every 20-25 years. Annette O'Toole, the late and great John Ritter, Richard Thomas, Olivia Hussey (anyone who has seen &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; from the '50s/'60s will recognize an all grown up Olivia Hussey), Tim Reid, Harry Anderson, Jonathan Brandis, Seth Green, and the rest of the cast all give excellent performances in the movie. Some of my favorite moments in the film was when Pennywise was terrorizing the characters as children as well as adults. I loved it when Pennywise shows up in a black and white photo album. And then there was the time, the picture of Billy's deceased little brother started to ooze blood.  I still can't believe that &quot;It&quot; is the result of dreams/nightmares Stephen King had over a period of nine years. Simply incredible. No matter how many times I watch this two part mini series, I still get creeped out by Pennywise. Thanks to Tim Curry and Stephen King, I will never see clowns in the same light again.

104272,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0790736039,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Stephen King is a very derrivative writer, and in many respects the 1986 novel IT reflects his 1982 novella ""The Body,"" which is better known as the film STAND BY ME--and perhaps more specifically the 1979 Peter Straub novel GHOST STORY.  ""The Body"" tells of a group of boys who take a long walk to see the dead body of an accidentally killed child, and who must confront not only their own fears, various frightening accidents, and a gang of vicious bullies; GHOST STORY concerns a group of boys who find themselves terrorized by a shape-shifting spirit who returns years later to further terrorize them as adults.  Although there are marked similarities, IT casts a somewhat wider net: in this instance the children--six boys and one girl--confront a shape-shifting creature that has been described as an inter-dimensional predator, something that slips between space and time to attack at will.  From time to time this creature appears in the small Maine town of Derry, where it kills children until its thirst is slaked.  Thereafter, and under the creature's influence, the town tends to forget that such murders happened ... until the next time.Like the book, this made-for-television version slips back in forth in between the late 1950s and the late 1980s (the film was made in 1990.  It typically appears in the guise of a clown, the better to lure children; if this fails, however, it can assume the form that which you love the most--or that which frightens you the most, depending on which is more effective.  After several murders, the children confront the monster and believe they have killed it, but they take an oath to return to Derry if It ever reappears.  Time passes, and their memory of the events fade, and they each go on to separate lives.  But quite suddenly the only one of the group to remain in Derry, librarian Richie Tozier (Harry Anderson), discovers that It has returned and the murders have resumed.  He telephones the circle of childhood friends, but only five return to honor their oath: one, too afraid to confront the monster again, commits suicide instead.  Once reunited, the remaining six do battle with the monster.Now, quite frankly, how much the film works depends a lot on whether you think clowns are creepy.  If you do, it will probably work for you and then some.  If you don't, you'll at least find the film well-made.  The cast is extremely good, with Harry Anderson, Annette O'Toole, John Ritter, and Richard Thomas particularly memorable.  Oddly, and although it was hailed at the time, Tim Curry's turn as Pennywise--the clown-guise in which It usually appears--is not as memorable as one might expect. Although slightly dated by today's standards, the the special effects are still quite effective, and director Tommy Lee Wallace drives the action at a good pace.  The film was originally shown in two parts on television, and the construction makes it obvious where commercials were inserted and the two parts were divided; the DVD quality, however, is very good indeed, although there are no significant special features beyond a director's commentary.

Nobody creeps up behind me with the old giant spider down the sewer disguised as clown ploy. I'm a Stephen King survivor. It's a support group, you know. A group of kids are not fooled by the giant spider down the sewer disguised as clown ploy and decide that this flagrant violation of local bye-laws shall not go unpunished. Naughty spider, stop what you are doing - that sort of thing. Call it a manifesto, if you like. Not to be out done, the spider retaliates with a manifesto of his own. &quot;I am the eater of worlds and of children&quot; he tells them. I do wish he'd get on with it then. I'm sorry, but popping up every few years and dancing in the streets dressed as a clown is not exactly cutting it in the world domination stakes. If he got on with the eating of worlds bit then the eating of children bit would sort of take care of itself, wouldn't it? But then spiders are not very bright. You yell at them to get the hell out of the bath from your vantage point standing on the sink but do they listen? No! Anyway, this spider gets his manifesto the wrong way round and has to resort to the old werewolf down the boiler room with attitude problem and no shoes ploy. The kids are not impressed by the old werewolf down the boiler room with attitude problem and no shoes ploy so they buy a sling shot for a couple of dollars and let rip.Years later they get together as adults and decide local bye-laws are still not being closely adhered to. Unfortunately, Richie has grown up to be a loud mouth who keeps insisting everyone leave town. Go already. So annoying is he that it's a wonder 'The Losers Club' as they are so monickered, don't borrow a gun off the clown and shoot him. Trouble is, a red flag saying 'BANG' would probably come out the end. The team decide they must go down the sewer and arrest the spider for over acting in a built up area. Just before they do, Richie tells them he's leaving for the airport. Go already. His mouth is so big you could fly a plane into it and still have room for a golf course. In the sewer they find a very small door. Now how does a spider go about carpentry? Did it kidnap Santa's elves? (It's a very small door and a few kids in the town won't be needing their presents anyway, heh-heh). It is at this dramatic point in the story that one of the team decides that this is just the moment to have a nervous breakdown over the fact that he's never had sex. Stop whining, it's never done me any harm. They find the door is easy to open. Great, he's the eater of worlds and he can't even afford a decent home security system. Now, in 'Annie Hall', Woody Allen sorted out a spider in Annie's bath the size of a Buick with a tennis racquet. I mean, Woody had the tennis racquet, not the spider. Unfortunately, The losers Club are faced with a spider the size of Wisconsin. There is no choice but to get stuck in and give the spider a quite comprehensive duffing up. That'll teach it to sell balloons without a license. It goes quiet and they walk away. Now, this is a mistake.

The whole story involves a group of kids, all &quot;losers&quot;, drawn together by a supernatural force to confront an ancient evil that takes the form of a malignant clown.Tim Curry was, I think, born to play Pennywise the Clown. Sadistic, waddling freak with his doughy, grinning white face, red wet lips stetched as wide as his ears. In his clown form, he is able to charm the younger kinds, but he becomes the fears of the older ones, taking them down into his sewer dungeon to feed on them. The kids that finally beat the monster, Big Bill and Haystack and Bev and the rest of the Loser's Club, manage to force It back into It's lair, not dead, but nearly mortally wounded....Driven by a feeding cycle, It rises again decades later, and the Loser's Club, now forgotten in adulthood, is drawn back together to face the monster one final time. This was originally made-for-television, so the movie is only capable of so much, but I think that fact alone gives the movie special merit. The casting was pretty much dead-on (especially in the case of Pennywise) and the special effects were surprisingly good. Probably the fact that the film makers were incapable of going the hack-and-slash rated-R route helped to improve the suspense and the atmosphere. The book was great, and the movie was great. I would recommend them both. I think that the humble perfection of a classic good versus evil story can sometimes be overlooked. The purity of a tale in which you can easily lose yourself.

That is, when it's a GOOD book.""IT"" isn't really a good book to begin with IMO. Read it once when it came out and once was enough. ""IT"" was just too long of a book with an ending that disappointed, for the effort spent reading it. Then the T.V. film was released and although I remember watching it then, I honestly didn't remember how I felt about it. Recently I came across the DVD for $3.00 (new). It said on the case that the running time was 3 hours. Hmmm. A buck an hour. Could it hurt? I shelled out my money and took home my bargain.So when I sat down to watch a film made from the book, I didn't expect the film version to magically change my mind about the book. It didn't. But I was hoping at least that I would be entertained. I wasn't.With respect to all the actors involved, the acting was painful to watch. I really felt sorry for most of these people who had to try and pretend that what they were saying was serious. I suppose that some of them needed a paycheck at the time the film was made. Maybe it was the direction. Maybe it should've been a musical. Who knows? The only thing I can say is ""IT"" was very hard to watch for 3 hours and perhaps I should've drank during the show.

104286,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,0790736039,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[0, 1]","Stephen King's ""It"" had potential to be a pretty good horror movie, but it ultimately fails to follow up on its early moments of horror that it creates.  Pennywise is creepy at times and other times, he is stupid, but overall, he is a convincing horror movie villain who symbolizes evil.One of the biggest problems this movie has is that there is so much reminiscing by the individual characters and that overshadows the actual present action of the movie...this hurts the movie in my opinion and drags the movie out longer than it needed to be.  I understand that a certain amount of looking or dreaming into the past is necessary in order to make the movie work, but I think this part is overdone and the viewer really has a hard time ascertaining the essence of the horror that the movie is trying to create.The acting is not bad at all, but the directing is poor at times, especially in the end.  The biggest criticism that I have for this movie is that with the somewhat scary atmosphere that this movie is able to create throughout the movie, it all comes to not and is pretty much destroyed by the movie's ending which is absolutely ridiculous because the manifestation of this monster in the end is a total joke.Pennywise, as a clown, was creepy enough, but this monster in the end looks ridiculous and is completely unconvincing.

I agree with many of the other reviewers when I say the first part was much better than the second.  My  main problem with this movie was going into it I was expecting to be freaked out.  While there were some scary parts it wasn't a terrifying movie.  I realize the psychological terror trying to be used here but It just didn't work for me.  The fact that the majority of the stuff going on is just in their heads just isn't scary.  Blood popping out of a ballon or a skeleton walking down stairs just isn't scary when you know it isn't real.  I'm not giving away stuff here but thats the whole basis for the movie.  It gave me the same feeling the Nightmare On Elm Street movies gave me.  I just say to myself, &quot;this stuff isn't even real why the hell are you getting scared?&quot;.  If you don't think that type of horror will scare you don't expect this movie to get your neck hairs standing.  I would have rated it a 5 stars had I not been expecting to be scared to death.  I think my problem is I need physical terror to really get me going like Halloween or Texas Chainsaw Massacre.So if your looking for an entertaining movie ,especially for family viewing, with some scares this is a great choice.

104293,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0790736039,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[9, 11]","This book, this film, is a masterpiece.First, it works on the fears and frights all children have, but those fears and frights are all dressed up as something they like, as a clown, so friendly-looking, so attractive, and yet IT is a fiend. Here King multiplies those fears so much, due to the fact that there are SEVEN children, six boys and one girl, that we get lost in the real labyrinth this book builds.Second, it analyzes those children in so many details, and it takes them thirty years later, unrealized for most of them, successful but totally unrealized, just empty shells, filled with oblivion and the impossibility to really be full and happy. That is the worst thing fear produces in a man or a woman, the impossibility to be happy and to fulfill his or her perspective, plan, project or future. He or she can maybe reach a certain level of fame, or art, or quality, but he or she cannot enjoy the happiness any man or woman should endeavour and deserve to get. IT is the anchor that forces us not to go all the way to the rising sun.Third, intelligence, conquering energy and strength is in children because they believe the world is not what they want it to be, they believe the world is what it wants to be, IT wants it to be, that is to say a long perspective of suffering and terror, interspierced with some moments of light and life and communion. This communion is the power of humanity. And grown-ups never get to that level of unity because they are afraid of the others, of their neighbors, of death, of suspicion, of what other people may think of them.Fourth, King invests the monster once again in the ground, underground. The monster is some kind of supernatural spider that needs to capture as many preys as possible every thirty years to be able to hibernate and live happily in its lair for the next thirty years. But then it has to come out again to feed and to replenish its cupboard with fresh meat and flesh.The most interesting aspect of this book or this film is the distance in time between the children and the grown-ups they become. The distance enables us to measure time and change, and yet to recognize that change is only on the surface whereas the depth of humanity, the depth of society, the depth of human nature remains the same. Yet a simple thing, like a bicycle, is able to bring infancy and childhood back and to enlighten the present with the past, to refill our heads with memories, and memories are the fodder of our minds, the force that is driving us to the sun and success. We can only get somewhere if we can solve the problems of our past, if we can get over the blocking stones of our engines, if we can put aside the narrow blinders education has put on our eyes and if we finally can see the whole picture all around and not be reduced to the tunnel vision most of us only have.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX",5,Oblivion is belief,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,2892,"['book', 'film', 'masterpiece.First', 'fears', 'frights', 'children', 'have', 'fears', 'frights', 'are', 'dressed', 'up', 'something', 'like', 'clown', 'friendly-looking', 'so', 'attractive', 'yet', 'IT', 'fiend', 'Here', 'King', 'multiplies', 'fears', 'so', 'much', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'SEVEN', 'children', 'six', 'boys', 'one', 'girl', 'get', 'lost', 'real', 'labyrinth', 'book', 'builds.Second', 'children', 'so', 'many', 'details', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'unrealized', 'most', 'successful', 'totally', 'unrealized', 'just', 'empty', 'shells', 'filled', 'oblivion', 'impossibility', 'really', 'be', 'full', 'happy', 'worst', 'thing', 'fear', 'man', 'woman', 'impossibility', 'be', 'happy', 'fulfill', 'perspective', 'plan', 'project', 'future', 'can', 'maybe', 'reach', 'certain', 'level', 'fame', 'art', 'quality', 'can', 'not', 'enjoy', 'happiness', 'man', 'woman', 'should', 'endeavour', 'deserve', 'get', 'IT', 'anchor', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'rising', 'sun.Third', 'intelligence', 'conquering', 'energy', 'strength', 'children', 'believe', 'world', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'believe', 'world', 'what', 'be', 'IT', 'be', 'say', 'long', 'perspective', 'suffering', 'terror', 'interspierced', 'moments', 'light', 'life', 'communion', 'communion', 'power', 'humanity', 'grown-ups', 'never', 'get', 'level', 'unity', 'are', 'afraid', 'others', 'neighbors', 'death', 'suspicion', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'may', 'think', 'them.Fourth', 'King', 'invests', 'monster', 'once', 'again', 'ground', 'underground', 'monster', 'kind', 'supernatural', 'spider', 'capture', 'many', 'preys', 'possible', 'thirty', 'years', 'be', 'able', 'hibernate', 'live', 'happily', 'lair', 'next', 'thirty', 'years', 'then', 'come', 'out', 'again', 'feed', 'replenish', 'cupboard', 'fresh', 'meat', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'book', 'film', 'distance', 'time', 'children', 'grown-ups', 'become', 'distance', 'measure', 'time', 'change', 'yet', 'recognize', 'change', 'only', 'surface', 'depth', 'humanity', 'depth', 'society', 'depth', 'human', 'nature', 'same', 'simple', 'thing', 'bicycle', 'able', 'bring', 'infancy', 'childhood', 'back', 'enlighten', 'present', 'past', 'refill', 'heads', 'memories', 'memories', 'are', 'fodder', 'minds', 'force', 'driving', 'sun', 'success', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'somewhere', 'can', 'solve', 'problems', 'past', 'can', 'get', 'blocking', 'stones', 'engines', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'narrow', 'blinders', 'education', 'put', 'eyes', 'finally', 'can', 'see', 'whole', 'picture', 'around', 'not', 'be', 'reduced', 'tunnel', 'vision', 'most', 'only', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'Paris', 'Universities', 'II', 'IX']",N/A

104300,A3I0CQIZIS2VKJ,0790736039,"J. Braddock ""Critical Jim""","[1, 1]","""It"" was taken from a rather longish and wordy novel by Stephen King. Lots of characters, very heavy on their respective backgrounds, and a scary monster (""It"") that terrorizes their lives and the town in which they live (Derry, Maine). From all this written material, the filmmakers have distilled the action down to a movie that is a little over 3 hours in length, which was a formidable task. For a 3-hour movie, It is pretty good, given the material/novel it had to cover. Is it as good as the book? No. Is it a pretty decent synopsis with interesting (and well-played) characters? I'd say yes that it is. Are the special effects OK? Yes - up until the end when the climatic battle with the It monster occurs. Then when we see It in its final incarnation, It appears as a big cheesy not-too-scary lumbering spider that looks like it was taken from a 3rd rate sci-fi movie. I realize the movie was made 1990, but the spider monster looks to be out of the 50s. (Note: good scary movie spiders can be found in 2007's ""The Mist"" (also by Stephen King) and also in ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy). If you read the novel, then you'll understand some of the shortcuts the filmakers had to take and you'll also understand some of the references that are not explained well in the movie.

This group of kids, now adults, reunite to battle the clown (It) once more.There are more than 420 Amazon reviews so far, so I just want to say what I liked and didn't like.Tim Curry plays Pennywise the Dancing Clown.  His performance is brilliant.  His voice and mannerisms are perfectly matched to his physical appearance.  He's quite a scary clown.  In my opinion, Pennywise doesn't get enough screen time in this movie.  He's actually a little bit underexposed.  The length of the movie?  It's over three hours long because it was made for TV.  This is mostly a negative, in my opinion.  A little too long to sit through in one sitting, though never boring.  The acting?  Overall it is good, for the most part.  How scary is this movie?  On a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the scariest, I'd give it a 3.  Clowns are scary to a lot of people.  If you're one of those people who is terrified of clowns, especially evil clowns, then this movie is for you because you'll be scared no matter what.The ending of the movie?

104320,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,0790736039,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","After buying endless horror movies to keep me busy this month, one that was on my list was Stephen King's IT and man oh man is this is a classic to come from the 1990s! Tim Curry is creepy in general, so it's no surprise that he fit the role as the demonic Pennywise to a T.The movie revolves around a group of outcasts known as The Losers Club who band together to stop the child-murdering Pennywise. Now there's not much of a back story given on Pennywise but after checking out a back story it's said that the clown's original name was a man named Bob Gray, who became Pennywise after a demon possessed his body nearly 200 years ago. The Losers Club simply refers to him as IT. IT feeds off little kids and manipulates them into thinking it's a clown, making them feel safe and secure where he then drags them down to his sewer lair and kills them. IT also has the ability to take the form of each kid's worst fears or a deceased relative. Whether it be a werewolf, a little brother, or an abusive father.There are two parts to the movie. In the first half, we're mainly given flashbacks of each outcasts' childhood and how they came together. Aside from battling the evil Pennywise, they're also in a constant battle with bully Henry Bowers and his cronies. Towards the end, The Losers Club comes together in the pit of the sewer to do battle with IT, making a promise that if they don't kill it, they'll come back and destroy it. They're followed there by Henry Bowers and his posse where his friends are ultimately killed off by IT after getting trapped in his deadlights.Part two picks up, years later where each outcast is all grown up and leading a successful life of some kind. After hearing about IT murdering someone, they re-unite in Derry to take out IT once and for all. Along the way, IT plays several mind games with them all, warning them to leave Derry while they can or they'll all suffer similar fates: Death. It's true when they say that part 2 isn't nearly as good as the first one but it's still enjoyable nonetheless. After The Losers Club reunites in Derry, IT goes to a Mental Facility to visit Henry Bowers, who confessed to murdering his friends. IT takes the form of one of Henry's friends who was killed, and convinces him to break out of the facility and kill The Losers Club. Henry agrees, is set free, and escapes to kill off The Losers Club.What follows is an unexpected visit from Henry Bowers at the house the Losers are staying at to do IT's dirty work followed by a final battle between The Losers and IT in his sewer cave, where they fight IT in it's true form, a huge, ugly, spider like creature.I must say that I enjoyed this movie a heck of a lot! I love clowns too---particularly the evil ones so it's not a surprise that I enjoyed Stephen King's IT. It was truly a great horror movie and will definitely increase a person's fear of clowns if they're not already scared of them enough. I need to read the novel as well to get more of an insight of the story. But if you don't own IT already, you need to! Buy it on here or go to your local FYE and get it for around $5.00.

104324,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,0790736039,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[0, 0]","In 1986, American horror novelist Stephen King released what was to become one of his most famous and critically acclaimed novels. The novel, simply called IT, spanned nearly a thousand pages in its first hardcover run. It had taken the author nearly four years to write, and had become an obsession. The subject of this work was the lives of seven friends who grew up in a small town in Maine called Derry, and the fateful summer of 1958 that bonded them to one another for the rest of their lives as they tried to survive a series of child murders.Three years later, director Tommy Lee Wallace received a screenplay for a TV mini-series based on this book. Never being much of a King fan himself, he took the script with ambivalent feelings. By the end of the first scene, he knew he wanted to make this production.The mini-series IT originally aired in the US on 18 November 1990. Split into two 90-minute parts across two nights, the mini-series effectively splices the interwoven narrative of the novel apart into two distinct Acts - the tale of childhood (90:05) and the tale of adulthood (89:35). In the first half, we meet the seven children and their adult counterparts - there is stuttering Bill Denbrough (Jonathan Brandis/Richard Thomas), whose younger brother George was one of the victims, porky fat boy Ben Hanscom (Brandon Crane/John Ritter) who has been forced to move to Derry after his father was killed in Korea, funny man Richard Tozier (Seth Green/Harry Anderson) whose less-than-funny comedic routines elicit the catch-cry `Beep-Beep, Ritchie' from his friends, the wheezing asthmatic Eddie Kaspbrak (Adam Faraizl/Dennis Christopher), the reserved Jewish disbeliever Stanley Uris (Ben Heller/Richard Masur), the beautiful poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks Beverly Marsh (Emily Perkins/Annette O'Toole), and the social outcast black kid Michael Hanlon (Marlon Taylor/Tim Reid). Together they are the Lucky Seven, or more appropriately, the Losers Club.As children, they are terrorized by a series of child murders in their small town, and a series of supernatural occurrences that the adults of the town are apparently blind to - a thing that sometimes manifests itself as a clown called Pennywise (Tim Curry), and other times as a facet of their darkest nightmares. Without a name to put to this thing, they simply call it the IT. As adults, when the murders begin again, each of them must decide whether to fulfil their promise to return to Derry to fight IT, and whether as adults they can achieve the luck and magic that saved them when they were kids.Is the mini-series better than the novel? No - but that is not really a fair question. Does it do justice to the novel? In some respects, yes. Tim Curry puts in one of the most memorable performances as the menacing clown Pennywise, that can change from jocular and amusing to brutal and terrifying in an instant. It is hard to read the book now and not picture Curry's performance in your head as you go. The mini-series also does a good job of capturing the nostalgia associated with childhood when you look back on it now.Unfortunately, the limitations of the mini-series format mean that IT misses out on a lot of what the novel contains, particularly in terms of King's commentary on what it means to be a child - your limitations counterbalanced with the gifts that you have in your youth that you steadily lose with time. The coming-of-age component of the novel really seems to have been skipped over in the mini-series, and it becomes more a tale of adventure, rather than a tale of innocence lost. In an era where audiences are very willing to accept 13-part series made for cable TV, it would be quite possible to split this book up over those 13 hours and make a far more comprehensive adaptation that captured those aspects. However, when we can now look back nostalgically on the 80s, a remake of IT for the new millennium would struggle to draw a crowd. Besides, who could you get to play Pennywise the Clown that would be any more schizophrenically menacing than Tim Curry?I hadn't sat down to watch this mini-series since the late 1990s, and was surprised at how much it held my attention all these years on. Some of the acting is a little camp and melodramatic, but that was the style of the era, and as such I can forgive these shortcomings. Ultimately, 14 years on from its first airing, this is still quite creepy, which is a rarity in adaptations from Stephen King novels, and I can guarantee that it will definitely scare the hell out of your kids.",5,Wonderfully frightening!,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,4559,"['1986', 'American', 'horror', 'novelist', 'Stephen', 'King', 'released', 'what', 'was', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'novels', 'novel', 'simply', 'called', 'IT', 'spanned', 'nearly', 'thousand', 'pages', 'first', 'hardcover', 'run', 'had', 'taken', 'author', 'nearly', 'four', 'years', 'write', 'had', 'become', 'obsession', 'subject', 'work', 'was', 'lives', 'seven', 'friends', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'Maine', 'called', 'Derry', 'fateful', 'summer', '1958', 'bonded', 'one', 'rest', 'lives', 'tried', 'survive', 'series', 'child', 'murders.Three', 'years', 'later', 'director', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'received', 'screenplay', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'based', 'book', 'Never', 'being', 'much', 'King', 'fan', 'took', 'script', 'ambivalent', 'feelings', 'end', 'first', 'scene', 'knew', 'wanted', 'make', 'production.The', 'mini-series', 'IT', 'originally', 'aired', 'US', '18', 'November', '1990', 'Split', 'two', '90-minute', 'parts', 'two', 'nights', 'mini-series', 'effectively', 'interwoven', 'narrative', 'novel', 'apart', 'two', 'distinct', 'Acts', 'tale', 'childhood', '90:05', 'tale', 'adulthood', '89:35', 'first', 'half', 'meet', 'seven', 'children', 'adult', 'counterparts', 'stuttering', 'Bill', 'Denbrough', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis/Richard', 'Thomas', 'younger', 'brother', 'George', 'was', 'one', 'victims', 'porky', 'fat', 'boy', 'Ben', 'Hanscom', 'Brandon', 'Crane/John', 'Ritter', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'move', 'Derry', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'Korea', 'funny', 'man', 'Richard', 'Tozier', 'Seth', 'Green/Harry', 'Anderson', 'less-than-funny', 'comedic', 'routines', 'elicit', 'catch-cry', 'Beep-Beep', 'Ritchie', 'friends', 'wheezing', 'asthmatic', 'Eddie', 'Kaspbrak', 'Adam', 'Faraizl/Dennis', 'Christopher', 'reserved', 'Jewish', 'disbeliever', 'Stanley', 'Uris', 'Ben', 'Heller/Richard', 'Masur', 'beautiful', 'poor', 'girl', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'Beverly', 'Marsh', 'Emily', 'Perkins/Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'social', 'outcast', 'black', 'kid', 'Michael', 'Hanlon', 'Marlon', 'Taylor/Tim', 'Reid', 'Together', 'are', 'Lucky', 'Seven', 'more', 'appropriately', 'Losers', 'Club.As', 'children', 'are', 'terrorized', 'series', 'child', 'murders', 'small', 'town', 'series', 'supernatural', 'occurrences', 'adults', 'town', 'are', 'apparently', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'clown', 'called', 'Pennywise', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'other', 'times', 'facet', 'darkest', 'nightmares', 'name', 'put', 'thing', 'simply', 'call', 'IT', 'adults', 'when', 'murders', 'begin', 'again', 'must', 'decide', 'fulfil', 'promise', 'return', 'Derry', 'fight', 'IT', 'adults', 'can', 'achieve', 'luck', 'magic', 'saved', 'when', 'were', 'kids.Is', 'mini-series', 'better', 'novel', 'No', 'not', 'really', 'fair', 'question', 'do', 'justice', 'novel', 'respects', 'yes', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'menacing', 'clown', 'Pennywise', 'can', 'change', 'jocular', 'amusing', 'brutal', 'terrifying', 'instant', 'hard', 'read', 'book', 'now', 'not', 'picture', 'Curry', 'performance', 'head', 'go', 'mini-series', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'nostalgia', 'associated', 'childhood', 'when', 'look', 'back', 'now.Unfortunately', 'limitations', 'mini-series', 'format', 'mean', 'IT', 'out', 'lot', 'what', 'novel', 'contains', 'particularly', 'terms', 'King', 'commentary', 'what', 'be', 'child', 'limitations', 'counterbalanced', 'gifts', 'have', 'youth', 'steadily', 'lose', 'time', 'coming-of-age', 'component', 'novel', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'skipped', 'mini-series', 'more', 'tale', 'adventure', 'rather', 'tale', 'innocence', 'lost', 'era', 'where', 'audiences', 'are', 'very', 'willing', 'accept', '13-part', 'series', 'made', 'cable', 'TV', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'possible', 'split', 'book', 'up', '13', 'hours', 'make', 'far', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'adaptation', 'captured', 'aspects', 'However', 'when', 'can', 'now', 'look', 'back', 'nostalgically', '80s', 'remake', 'IT', 'new', 'millennium', 'would', 'struggle', 'draw', 'crowd', 'Besides', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'play', 'Pennywise', 'Clown', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'schizophrenically', 'menacing', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'had', ""n't"", 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'mini-series', 'late', '1990s', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'held', 'attention', 'years', 'acting', 'little', 'camp', 'melodramatic', 'was', 'style', 'era', 'such', 'can', 'forgive', 'shortcomings', 'Ultimately', '14', 'years', 'first', 'airing', 'still', 'quite', 'creepy', 'rarity', 'adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'can', 'guarantee', 'will', 'definitely', 'scare', 'hell', 'kids']",N/A

I had always been a tad frightened of clowns and thanks to this movie (and the book), I'm now completely afraid of them!  Well not as much as I used to be, but It was definitely a large contributing factor.Onto the movie... I thought that for the most part, especially because It was a made-for-TV movie that it captured the major themes from the book.  Now I had watched this before reading the book.  After reading the book I watched the movie again and came to find that several things were left out, probably due to what is allowed to be shown on television (this was not broadcast on cable, I believe it was on ABC) but I thought some of the acting could have been better than it was.The one person who I thought really shined (no pun intended to Stephen King's other incredible novel....) was Tim Curry.  I was in total disbelief that he was this demonic clown!  Who knew he is able to delve into rather disturbing roles!  He didn't sound like himself at all (no accent); his voice was really distorted but that made him all the more scary which really worked in his favor and the movie's favor as well.Everyone else did a pretty good job, and casting Richard Thomas in the main role of Bill was a wise decision.  I saw this before John Ritter passed away and thought he was excellent as well.  Now when I watch the movie I always get a little sad when I see him, especially if I watch with the commentary.  Tim Reid was a good choice for Mike but at times I thought he overacted a bit.  Still it was fun to see the dad from Sister-Sister in something much darker.As for the plot, a lot of things that were in the book were not included here which made for some holes.  We are never told where It really came from like we are in the book.  That was a rather important plot point that should have been here and if Stephen King had been a part of this adaptation, I'm sure he would have included it.Bottom line: if you are a horror fan (and don't mind the lack of special effects; this was made in 1990 after all) you'll most likely enjoy this adaptation of Stephen King's It.You'll never feel the same way about clowns again.....",4,They all float...,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,2224,"['first', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'about', '11', 'when', 'brother', 'rented', 'video', 'store', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'tad', 'frightened', 'clowns', 'thanks', 'movie', 'book', ""'m"", 'now', 'completely', 'afraid', 'Well', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'used', 'be', 'was', 'definitely', 'large', 'contributing', 'movie', 'thought', 'most', 'part', 'especially', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'captured', 'major', 'themes', 'book', 'Now', 'had', 'watched', 'reading', 'book', 'reading', 'book', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'came', 'find', 'several', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'probably', 'due', 'what', 'allowed', 'be', 'shown', 'television', 'was', 'not', 'broadcast', 'cable', 'believe', 'was', 'ABC', 'thought', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'thought', 'really', 'shined', 'pun', 'intended', 'Stephen', 'King', 'other', 'incredible', 'novel', 'was', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'was', 'total', 'disbelief', 'was', 'demonic', 'clown', 'Who', 'knew', 'able', 'delve', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'roles', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'accent', 'voice', 'was', 'really', 'distorted', 'made', 'more', 'scary', 'really', 'worked', 'favor', 'movie', 'favor', 'well.Everyone', 'else', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'casting', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'main', 'role', 'Bill', 'was', 'wise', 'decision', 'saw', 'John', 'Ritter', 'passed', 'away', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'Now', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'always', 'get', 'little', 'sad', 'when', 'see', 'especially', 'watch', 'commentary', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'Mike', 'times', 'thought', 'overacted', 'bit', 'Still', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'dad', 'Sister-Sister', 'something', 'much', 'darker.As', 'plot', 'lot', 'things', 'were', 'book', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'here', 'made', 'holes', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'where', 'really', 'came', 'are', 'book', 'was', 'rather', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'Stephen', 'King', 'had', 'been', 'part', 'adaptation', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'it.Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'horror', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'lack', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'made', '1990', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'It.You', ""'ll"", 'never', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'clowns', 'again', '..']",N/A

Naturally the film is not as good as the book by Stephen King but it's actually quite entertaining. Since it was a 1990 two-part TV mini-series it never got much respect but it is fairly faithful to the novel. Tommy Lee Wallace assembles an amazing cast. Tim Reid was incredible. They all make the movie work and I have enjoyed watching it many times. There are at least 5 cuts of the film with different running times. The longest is 192-minutes and the shortest is 168-minutes.

Blame it on Pennywise, the hideous beast-clown portrayed so excellently here by Tim Curry. Incidentally this was the first time I had seen Tim Curry in anything, and even when I see his movies today, all I can think of is this movie. To be fair, this WAS a TV film, and watching this recently I was reminded of how movies one watched in the 1980s when one was a child, are now close to unwatchable. Not so with this film, for the most part, because for some strange reason, I had forgotten most of the story - and the chills genuinely worked, all over again.I read the book ""IT"" when I was ten years old. Sleepless nights ensued, and when my brother and I first watched the film, we were struck by real, honest-to-goodness terror. This is hardly a movie for children. However, what the book had in eloquence (really, ""IT"" is perhaps the best-written King novel of them all, because he used some beautiful language and imagery in it), the movie makes up with shocks and thrills, and of course, the clown and his sly smile (and the teeth - good Lord, those teeth) are enough to drive young teens insane with fear.Still, for people who are watching this for the first time now, it might all be a bit tame. The only thing really scary is the clown, and the horrible music score really dates the film and reveals it as a tacky TV miniseries. Still, that's not bad considering this is still very watchable and it will work perfectly for a Saturday night at home with friends. Another thing - it holds up to repeat viewing, another plus in this day and age, so you might want to consider actually buying a copy.

Either way, it's a pretty big failure.They got one thing right: Tim Curry.  He does a great job of an alternatingly unnerving and terrifying Pennywise.But that's about it.  The rest of the casting was weak to awful.  Some of the kids were okay - Brandon Crane as Ben, Seth Green as Richie and Adam Faraizl as Eddie were all pretty close to what the characters in the book were. Even Marlon Taylor as Mike and Jarred Blancard as Henry Bowers were pretty good.  But Emily Perkins as Bev was woefully miscast.  She wasn't bad, per se, but this is supposed to be a young girl who is stunning - which Perkins is not.  Jonathan Brandis as Stuttering Bill does one of the worst fake stutters I've ever heard and the rest of his acting isn't partticularly better.But it's better than their adult counterparts.  Who allowed this casting director to do another movie after this?  Richard Thomas (who does just as bad if not a worse stutter as his young counterpart) looks nothing like Jonathan Brandis, but even HE is closer than Richard Masur's supposed growth from model-good-looking Ben Heller into..... well..... pasty Richard Masur.  It's one scene - you couldn't get a nobody who looked like the kid for ONE SCENE?  And don't get me started on the incidental roles of Ben Hanscom's Latina-who-totally-got-this-job-on-the-casting-couch date and Ryan Michaels as Tom Rogan.From there, the script is........ decent if we're ignoring any source material.  But the special effects are appallingly bad.Now, if we're paying attention to the book?I know it's impossible to tell this story on TV (which begs the question why the hell would you TRY?) as it involves a lot that you simply cannot show (LOTS of blood but worse, some terrible things that human beings do to one another), but they changed stuff that didn't need to be changed at all.  Suddenly Eddie is gay?  Mike had to go back and scrounge around for the silver bullet?  The clown visiting Eddie in the shower?  Henry Bowers's hair turns white from fear? (In a REALLY bad sequence, to boot....)  But perhaps the worst part is the final sequence when they confront IT in It's lair.Now, look, part of the reason the book is so good is that it conjures up unthinkable unspeakable creatures that can only live in our minds and does so using concepts of good and evil and time and space and nothingness that make the mind reel.  The deadlights, for example, are a brilliant idea.  And anyone who knows King's previous or later work with the Dark Tower will recognize deep meaning in the Turtle, It, and many other Mid-Worldian things.  But these simply cannot be filmed.  And if there was any chance that they COULD, it would not happen in a 1990 TV movie with a too-small budget.And it sure as hell wouldn't have looked like a crappy spider with headlights.Talk about a way to drop all terror from that scene.It's no surprise that a movie is rarely if ever as good as the book, but this is a book which will be nearly impossible to film correctly.  The one thing it did get right was the 1950's tone, part of why it seemed so real.  But the jump into the 80's is so cheesy and bad that everything just stops dead in it's tracks.Maybe..... MAYBE it would be possible to do this again (which they're planning) in a three hour film with millions of dollars in effects and a decent director.  But I doubt it.  Like Pet Sematary's final filmed scene with a three-year-old portraying a thousand-year-old evil spirit, some things are terrifying because they can never be seen, only imagined.  And trying will almost always certainly miss the mark.",1,Wow bad,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,3752,"['are', 'two', 'ways', 'look', 'early', 'nineties', 'TV', 'movie', 'really', '80', 'TV', 'movie', 'own', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'way', 'pretty', 'big', 'failure.They', 'got', 'one', 'thing', 'right', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'great', 'job', 'alternatingly', 'unnerving', 'terrifying', 'Pennywise.But', 'rest', 'casting', 'was', 'weak', 'awful', 'kids', 'were', 'okay', 'Brandon', 'Crane', 'Ben', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Richie', 'Adam', 'Faraizl', 'Eddie', 'were', 'pretty', 'close', 'what', 'characters', 'book', 'were', 'Even', 'Marlon', 'Taylor', 'Mike', 'Jarred', 'Blancard', 'Henry', 'Bowers', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Emily', 'Perkins', 'Bev', 'was', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'se', 'supposed', 'be', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'stunning', 'Perkins', 'not', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'Stuttering', 'Bill', 'one', 'worst', 'fake', 'stutters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'rest', 'acting', ""n't"", 'partticularly', 'better.But', 'better', 'adult', 'counterparts', 'Who', 'allowed', 'casting', 'director', 'do', 'movie', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'who', 'just', 'bad', 'not', 'worse', 'stutter', 'young', 'counterpart', 'nothing', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'even', 'HE', 'closer', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'supposed', 'growth', 'model-good-looking', 'Ben', 'Heller', '..', 'well', '..', 'pasty', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'one', 'scene', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'nobody', 'who', 'looked', 'kid', 'ONE', 'SCENE', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'incidental', 'roles', 'Ben', 'Hanscom', 'Latina-who-totally-got-this-job-on-the-casting-couch', 'date', 'Ryan', 'Michaels', 'Tom', 'Rogan.From', 'there', 'script', '..', 'decent', ""'re"", 'ignoring', 'source', 'material', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'appallingly', 'bad.Now', ""'re"", 'paying', 'attention', 'book', 'know', 'impossible', 'tell', 'story', 'TV', 'question', 'why', 'hell', 'would', 'TRY', 'lot', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'show', 'LOTS', 'blood', 'worse', 'terrible', 'things', 'human', 'beings', 'do', 'one', 'changed', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'changed', 'Suddenly', 'Eddie', 'gay', 'Mike', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'scrounge', 'around', 'silver', 'bullet', 'clown', 'visiting', 'Eddie', 'shower', 'Henry', 'Bowers', 'hair', 'white', 'fear', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'sequence', 'boot', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'part', 'final', 'sequence', 'when', 'confront', 'IT', 'lair.Now', 'look', 'part', 'reason', 'book', 'so', 'good', 'up', 'unthinkable', 'unspeakable', 'creatures', 'can', 'only', 'live', 'minds', 'so', 'using', 'concepts', 'good', 'evil', 'time', 'space', 'nothingness', 'make', 'mind', 'reel', 'deadlights', 'example', 'are', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'anyone', 'who', 'King', 'previous', 'later', 'work', 'Dark', 'Tower', 'will', 'recognize', 'deep', 'meaning', 'Turtle', 'many', 'other', 'Mid-Worldian', 'things', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'filmed', 'was', 'chance', 'COULD', 'would', 'not', 'happen', '1990', 'TV', 'movie', 'too-small', 'budget.And', 'sure', 'hell', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'looked', 'crappy', 'spider', 'headlights.Talk', 'way', 'drop', 'terror', 'scene.It', 'surprise', 'movie', 'rarely', 'ever', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'film', 'correctly', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'get', 'right', 'was', '1950', 'tone', 'part', 'why', 'seemed', 'so', 'real', 'jump', '80', 'so', 'cheesy', 'bad', 'everything', 'just', 'stops', 'dead', 'tracks.Maybe', 'MAYBE', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'do', 'again', ""'re"", 'planning', 'three', 'hour', 'film', 'millions', 'dollars', 'effects', 'decent', 'director', 'doubt', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'final', 'filmed', 'scene', 'three-year-old', 'portraying', 'thousand-year-old', 'evil', 'spirit', 'things', 'are', 'terrifying', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'only', 'imagined', 'trying', 'will', 'almost', 'always', 'certainly', 'miss', 'mark']",N/A

104342,A1Y87E22UVYCE6,0790736039,"Maximiliano F Yofre ""Maxi""","[3, 3]","Stephen King's novels are very difficult to shape into a movie and usually turn into disappointing fiascos.Fortunately ""It"" (1990) is an exception to this rule (as ""Salem's Lot"" second version).Most difficult to reflect in the screen are certain climates and sharp notes on human conduct that are King's trade mark. Another obstacle is the extension of text and huge number of significant characters, this make unavoidable to omit scenes and characters when passing from novel to movie.Miniseries format is a good option as allows a reasonable extent of time to develop situations, show characters in some detail and reduce production budget.The story takes place, as most King's stories, in a little Maine's town with all the ins and outs of a small village. In Spanish we have a saying: ""Small town, big inferno"".Derry is not an exception, even more so, something evil influence townspeople and make them act, at times, worst than average. These traits are clearly shown in the novel and only insinuated in the telefilm.Derry is periodically subject to mass children disappearances and murder that rest unsolved.Action starts with the emergence one of these havoc periods when Mike Hanlon, Derry's librarian, launches an SOS to his six old friends disseminated all over the world.The convoked react with a mixture of shock, fright and dreadful memories avalanche. Little by little they remember the forgotten story of their epic struggle against Evil, personified by diabolic clown Pennywise, when they were just kids.Now, to their dismay, Mike recalls them to action, to fulfill their oath and to confront horrible odds at Derry's sewers.The film portrays the past and the present struggle between ""The Seven Losers"" and ""The Evil Clown"" in shrilling way!Playacting is average, still enough to enact the story believably. Tim Curry as Pennywise is an outstanding exception to these standard performances. His impersonation of Evil is really creepy.IMHO kids' team is far more successful than the grownups I especially like Emily Perkins as young Bev and Brandon Crane as teenager Ben.One high point is music score (awarded with an Emmy) by Richard Bellis.It is an excellent film for lovers of the genre!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Beware of Clowns with Sharp Teeth!,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,2228,"['Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'shape', 'movie', 'usually', 'turn', 'disappointing', 'fiascos.Fortunately', '1990', 'exception', 'rule', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'second', 'version', '.Most', 'difficult', 'reflect', 'screen', 'are', 'certain', 'climates', 'sharp', 'notes', 'human', 'conduct', 'are', 'King', 'trade', 'mark', 'obstacle', 'extension', 'text', 'huge', 'number', 'significant', 'characters', 'make', 'unavoidable', 'omit', 'scenes', 'characters', 'when', 'passing', 'novel', 'movie.Miniseries', 'format', 'good', 'option', 'reasonable', 'extent', 'time', 'develop', 'situations', 'show', 'characters', 'detail', 'reduce', 'production', 'budget.The', 'story', 'place', 'most', 'King', 'stories', 'little', 'Maine', 'town', 'ins', 'outs', 'small', 'village', 'Spanish', 'have', 'saying', 'Small', 'town', 'big', 'inferno', '.Derry', 'not', 'exception', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'something', 'evil', 'influence', 'townspeople', 'make', 'act', 'times', 'worst', 'average', 'traits', 'are', 'clearly', 'shown', 'novel', 'only', 'insinuated', 'telefilm.Derry', 'periodically', 'subject', 'mass', 'children', 'disappearances', 'murder', 'rest', 'unsolved.Action', 'emergence', 'one', 'havoc', 'periods', 'when', 'Mike', 'Hanlon', 'Derry', 'librarian', 'SOS', 'six', 'old', 'friends', 'disseminated', 'world.The', 'convoked', 'react', 'mixture', 'shock', 'fright', 'dreadful', 'memories', 'avalanche', 'Little', 'little', 'remember', 'forgotten', 'story', 'epic', 'struggle', 'Evil', 'personified', 'diabolic', 'clown', 'Pennywise', 'when', 'were', 'just', 'kids.Now', 'dismay', 'Mike', 'action', 'fulfill', 'oath', 'confront', 'horrible', 'odds', 'Derry', 'sewers.The', 'film', 'past', 'present', 'struggle', 'Seven', 'Losers', 'Evil', 'Clown', 'shrilling', 'way', 'Playacting', 'average', 'still', 'enough', 'enact', 'story', 'believably', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Pennywise', 'outstanding', 'exception', 'standard', 'performances', 'impersonation', 'Evil', 'really', 'creepy.IMHO', 'kids', 'team', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'grownups', 'especially', 'Emily', 'Perkins', 'young', 'Bev', 'Brandon', 'Crane', 'teenager', 'Ben.One', 'high', 'point', 'music', 'score', 'awarded', 'Emmy', 'Richard', 'Bellis.It', 'excellent', 'film', 'lovers', 'genre', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

104344,A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1,0790736039,Melissa,"[44, 52]","This movie I believe was one of the first mini series I have seen by Stephen King. I watched from start to finish I was so interested in the kids in this film. Two who are played by popular actor's today Seth Green (Young Richie Tozer), and Jonathan Brandis (Young Bill Denbrough). The children band together and call themselves ""The Looser's Club"" they face being different from their classmates and they also face their parents. But what they must ultmiately face is the monster who kills children called ""Pennywise the Clown."" Together and only together as a team can they defeat the monster.In the first half of the film we learn of the Clown (Played by the great Tim Curry) and the history with the town of Derry, Maine. We see the kids meeting for the first time and the fun they all have. But the serious times comes when they band together to stand up for themselves against a few of the classmates namly Henry Bowers who likes to torment the other kids in the school. They then come together to form a circle and defeat the clown/monster. With a promise that if it wasn't dead they would all come back to destroy it.In the second part of the film we see whats happened to them career wise and love life wise. Its a tad slower, but it is definately funny and has its serious moments as well. The kids all grown up are now played by a great cast: Henry Anderson (Richie Tozer), Dennis Christopher (Eddie Kaspbrak), Richard Masur (Stan Uris), Annette O' Toole (Beverly Marsh), John Ritter (Ben Hascom), Tim Reid (Mike Hanlon), and Richard Thomas as (Bill Denbrough). Again the second part starts off slow. But its fun to see them all come together again. And to try and remember the good and bad times and defeat the ""clown.""I was very much interested to see Stephen King use children to believe in this monster to where the adults couldn't. It's also interesting to see this sort of similarity in some of his other where the children are the key. Which I find really grand in a way. This movie did; however, really turn me off of clowns. So it does have its creep factor in the movie. I would definately recommend it! Athough the book does give more great detail and is better, and the book is different in most parts.

104347,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0790736039,Michael Butts,"[2, 3]","When IT first came out back in the mid 80s, it was one of my favorite books.  Even with its gargantuan size, King managed to hold my interest and I felt totally immersed in the tiny town of Derry and the seven youngsters who carried the weight of the book on their shoulders.  I first saw the movie adaptation when it aired as a mini-series on TV and although I found it quite good, its ""tacky"" spider ending and the miscasting of the adults kept it from being the classic I would have liked to see.  Viewing it again now, some fifteen years later, I found it more enjoyable without all the commercial breaks and having to wait a night to see the next episode.  What makes IT such a refreshing horror novel/movie is its focus on friendship, something King captures beautifully, particularly when the characters are kids.  Kids nowadays would never know the joy of forming a secret club, building a dam, or binding together to face the usual bullies of childhood.  The young actors are superb:  the late Jonathan Brandis (he committed suicide in 2003) as Bill; Emily Perkins (Brigitte in the Ginger Snaps series), and Ben Heller as young Ben are especially good.  Unfortunately, when casting the adults, the producers opted to go for familiar TV faces (Richard Thomas, John Ritter, Tim Reid, Harry Anderson) or actors from B-movies (Dennis Christopher of Fade to Black), and these guys just didn't fill the adult shoes as convincingly as I would have liked.  Annette O'Toole (One on One) does do a good job as the adult Beverly, and Olivia Hussey adds some British class in her small role as Thomas' wife.  But Thomas seemed to be an adult version of his John Boy Walton and Anderson, Reid and Ritter overacted shamelessly.  Some of the special effects early on are quite good but the spider at the end is just not menacing or convincing enough, so the movie loses a lot of momentum there.

104349,A2M1N8G4W4END8,0790736039,Michael R Gates,"[12, 13]","STEPHEN KING'S IT is arguably the best of the TV films based on a Stephen King work.  While devoid of countless details from the novel that would have made the plot more understandable to those viewers who don't actually READ King, the movie is nonetheless engaging and downright SCARY!One reason STEPHEN KING'S IT rises above standard TV-movie fare is the excellent cast.  John Ritter, Annette O'Toole, Richard Thomas, Tim Reid, and Harry Anderson deliver stellar performances in their roles of adult versions of the story's protagonists, and Jonathan Brandis (later the teen-heartthrob co-star of TV's SEAQUEST DSV), Seth Green, and Emily Perkins do an excellent job of evoking childhood crisis and trauma in the flashback segments.  But it is Tim Curry (yes, THE Tim Curry of ROCKY HORROR fame), as antagonist Pennywise the Clown, who really chews the scenery and steals the show.  If Curry's marvelously malevolent merry-andrew doesn't make you develop coulrophobia (fear of clowns), he will at least haunt your nightmares for a night or two after your first viewing.Another reason this flick rates so highly is that it is, simply put, a ripping good horror story.  King is a master at realistically recreating the wondrous ambiance of youth and childhood, and in spite of the minor shortcomings in the film's recreation of King's plot, the atmosphere of the novel is perfectly translated to the screen.  Besides that, King is also keenly aware that the things that scared us when we were kids are probably still lurking deep down in our grown-up psyche, just waiting to find a little mental crack to jump out of and give us a case of goose bumps and chills.  The film version of STEPHEN KING'S IT finds that same little crack...then pries it wide open!The long-awaited DVD version of STEPHEN KING'S IT is sparse on frills, but it does have an excellent feature commentary with stars John Ritter, Richard Thomas, Tim Reid, Dennis Christopher, and director Tommy Lee Wallace.  Of course, the picture quality is beautifully crystal clear, especially when compared to the VHS version, but purists should consider a few caveats before purchasing. First, the picture has been cropped a bit to simulate theatrical widescreen format.  In comparison to the VHS version, which offers the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, there are small slivers of image missing from both the top and bottom.  (To be fair, it should also be noted that the picture on VHS appears to be scrunched a bit horizontally to fit it into the TV ""square,"" so it really doesn't seem as if all that much has been removed to create the faux widescreen on DVD.)  Also, gone are the ""To be continued"" message and the second set of credits, both of which originally appeared between the first half and second half of the original two-part movie (these were included on the VHS).So the new DVD version of this excellent movie should, for the most part, please King fans and general horror fans alike.  For the movie alone, STEPHEN KING'S IT would easily rate 5 stars.  But taking into account the adulterated aspect ratio and the slightly altered transition from Part 1 to Part 2, this DVD gets an overall rating of 4 stars.",4,"""They All Float Down Here!""",1035158400,"10 21, 2002",2002,3182,"['STEPHEN', 'KING', 'IT', 'arguably', 'best', 'TV', 'films', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'work', 'devoid', 'countless', 'details', 'novel', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'plot', 'more', 'understandable', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'READ', 'King', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'engaging', 'downright', 'SCARY', 'One', 'reason', 'STEPHEN', 'KING', 'IT', 'standard', 'TV-movie', 'fare', 'excellent', 'cast', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'Harry', 'Anderson', 'deliver', 'stellar', 'performances', 'roles', 'adult', 'versions', 'story', 'protagonists', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'later', 'teen-heartthrob', 'co-star', 'TV', 'SEAQUEST', 'DSV', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Emily', 'Perkins', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'evoking', 'childhood', 'crisis', 'trauma', 'flashback', 'segments', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'yes', 'THE', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'ROCKY', 'HORROR', 'fame', 'antagonist', 'Pennywise', 'Clown', 'who', 'really', 'scenery', 'show', 'Curry', 'marvelously', 'malevolent', 'merry-andrew', ""n't"", 'make', 'develop', 'coulrophobia', 'fear', 'clowns', 'will', 'least', 'haunt', 'nightmares', 'night', 'two', 'first', 'viewing.Another', 'reason', 'flick', 'rates', 'so', 'highly', 'simply', 'put', 'ripping', 'good', 'horror', 'story', 'King', 'master', 'realistically', 'recreating', 'wondrous', 'ambiance', 'youth', 'childhood', 'spite', 'minor', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'recreation', 'King', 'plot', 'atmosphere', 'novel', 'perfectly', 'translated', 'screen', 'King', 'also', 'keenly', 'aware', 'things', 'scared', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'are', 'probably', 'still', 'lurking', 'deep', 'down', 'grown-up', 'psyche', 'just', 'waiting', 'find', 'little', 'mental', 'crack', 'jump', 'give', 'case', 'goose', 'bumps', 'chills', 'film', 'version', 'STEPHEN', 'KING', 'IT', 'same', 'little', 'crack', 'then', 'wide', 'open', 'long-awaited', 'DVD', 'version', 'STEPHEN', 'KING', 'IT', 'sparse', 'frills', 'have', 'excellent', 'feature', 'commentary', 'stars', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'Dennis', 'Christopher', 'director', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'course', 'picture', 'quality', 'beautifully', 'crystal', 'clear', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'VHS', 'version', 'purists', 'should', 'consider', 'few', 'caveats', 'purchasing', 'First', 'picture', 'been', 'cropped', 'bit', 'simulate', 'theatrical', 'widescreen', 'format', 'comparison', 'VHS', 'version', 'original', '1.33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'are', 'small', 'slivers', 'image', 'missing', 'top', 'bottom', 'be', 'fair', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'picture', 'VHS', 'be', 'scrunched', 'bit', 'horizontally', 'fit', 'TV', 'square', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', 'that', 'much', 'been', 'removed', 'create', 'faux', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'Also', 'gone', 'are', 'be', 'continued', 'message', 'second', 'set', 'credits', 'originally', 'appeared', 'first', 'half', 'second', 'half', 'original', 'two-part', 'movie', 'were', 'included', 'VHS', '.So', 'new', 'DVD', 'version', 'excellent', 'movie', 'should', 'most', 'part', 'please', 'King', 'fans', 'general', 'horror', 'fans', 'alike', 'movie', 'alone', 'STEPHEN', 'KING', 'IT', 'would', 'easily', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'taking', 'account', 'adulterated', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'slightly', 'altered', 'transition', 'Part', '1', 'Part', '2', 'DVD', 'overall', 'rating', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Moore,"[1, 1]","Any scene in Stephen King's ""It"" that features Tim Curry as the evil, shape-shifting clown Pennywise is sublimely scary--particularly his first appearance, which will make you jump out of your seat. The rest of it, unfortunately, is a standard-issue TV-movie, not bad but not distinguished or even particularly frightening. Richard Thomas and John Ritter give decent performances, and Richard Masur makes the most of his few gory minutes on screen. But the other adult actors get annoying after a while, and the ending is frankly lame compared with the scenes of Pennywise. Of the child actors, the best by far is Jonathan Brandis, playing Richard Thomas' character as a child. It is unbearably sad to think that Brandis hanged himself a dozen or so years later, just as it is unbearable to think of River Phoenix's fate after seeing ""Stand By Me.""The plot of ""It"" bears a definite resemblance to that of ""Stand By Me""--particularly the themes of the vicious teenage gang threatening the smart, nerdy kids and tne general lack of empathy among the adults. 'It"" introduces the idea that Pennywise's influence has made the whole town mean, but it doesn't develop that theme. I have no idea whether King developed it more in the book, but I can't help but notice that the Maine townspeople in King's books tend to be cold and cruel in general, much like the nasty New Englanders in Shirley Jackson's books. I don't know if King can be accused of stealing from Jackson on that count, but between the stories of those two, it sure doesn't make me want to visit New England!The extras on the DVDs are sparse, consisting only of commentary by the director, Tommy Lee Wallace, and the cast.

To say the least, one feels like he's still watching the children, which, although maybe intentional, boors the audience to death after the first hour or two.The fact that 'IT' was a television premeire explains why the camerawork is a bit run-of-the-mill, and the electronic and sometimes dulling soundtrack is enough for you to go rent ""The Dentist,"" instead.I admit that clowns are somewhat of a nightmarish fetish, but to be frank, fellas--Tim Curry just didn't make me jump.

The premise of the movie and some of the first half is pretty genuinely frightening, 'specially if you have quite an imagination like I do, and Tim Curry REALLY takes on the role of Pennywise well.  In fact, if you watch this movie for anything at all, watch it for Curry as the deranged killer clown, as it is, hands-down, the most memorable performance in the movie.  But, other than that, the most entertaining aspect is director Tommy Lee Wallace's stylish camerawork, and jus' watching the story unfold, as each of the character's begin to lose their grip on reality.  I mean I'm not a fan of Stephen King's novels or movies at all (aside from 'The Shining', the movie, NOT the book, course that was more Kubrick than King), but he really laid down a pretty original and chilling tale here, that will really play on your psyche.  But it's ruined by too much melodramatic dialogue, cheesy, unconvincing love stories, and all around hammy acting from the main players.  The only really decent performance I saw of the seven friends was Harry Anderson, whose sarcasm and dry wit was DESPERATELY needed to give some spark to the lifeless and emotionless dialogue.

Something ominous lurking in the basement. No matter what your biggest fear is, no one knows IT better than Stephen King. Based on King's 1986 bestseller, IT is a jittery, jolting excursion into personal fear starring Harry Anderson, Annette O'Toole, John Ritter and Richard Thomas. A malevolent force in a small New England town takes the shape of a clown (Tim Curry), but he's not clowning around. Instead, he terrifies youngsters and brings some of their untimely doom -- until some wily kids fight back. The evil resurfaces 30 years later: meaner, angrier, dealier. And friends who vividly remember youthful terrors reunite to battle IT.""Stephen King's IT has become a horror classic. And, surprisingly enough, it was a made-for-TV miniseries (a two-nighter). Running at a little over three hours long and designed to be appropriate for the average Joe tuning in to its original broadcast in 1990, you'd think it'd be a bit of a stinker. But by all means, IT provides a thrilling and darkly charasmatic adventure into one very terrifying story. Great script, great directing, great cast. And the best part? Well...Remeber Bozo? Ah, what a great guy. How about Clarabell, or even Ronald McDonald? Clowns have been a real treat to the entertainment business for as long as we can remember. But Tim Curry changed that for oh so many children and adults alike with this film. Undeniably the star of the show -- whether for freaky amusement or inescapable horror -- Curry really helped this along in its long running time. Don't get me wrong, the character development through childhood scenes and drama unfolding between them as adults really keeps the viewer interested and engaged. But let's face it, without Curry's performance there would be something missing. Luckily, we're given plenty of delightfully scary scenes showing off the unforgettable portrayal of history's most malevolent clown throughout the film.By the end, you can't help but to feel for the characters and be glued to the screen -- even if you've seen it already. It's one of the best examples out there of how a lot of time can actually be put to good use and overall make a great movie. IT -- just like many of King's writings -- really grabs the viewer and reflects on something we can all look back at with awe and mystery: childhood.Sadly, there aren't many special features on this double-sided disc. But there is a fairly interesting commentary with Dennis Christopher, Tim Reid, John Ritter, Richard Thomas, and Director Tommy Lee Wallace (why no Curry? probably not available. they do talk about him a bit, though). And with a wonderful, crystal-clear print and audio, you won't mind the almost bear-bones packaging. So go ahead and pick this baby up for one hell of a ride into a nightmare where fear reigns over all!",5,"""I'm Everything You Ever Were Afraid Of!""",1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,2940,"['plot', 'details', 'here', 'what', 'back', 'DVD', 'box', 'reads', 'IT', 'can', 'be', 'anything', 'fanged', 'monster', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'movie', 'screen', 'Something', 'ominous', 'lurking', 'basement', 'matter', 'what', 'biggest', 'fear', 'one', 'IT', 'better', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Based', 'King', '1986', 'bestseller', 'IT', 'jittery', 'jolting', 'excursion', 'personal', 'fear', 'starring', 'Harry', 'Anderson', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'John', 'Ritter', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'A', 'malevolent', 'force', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'shape', 'clown', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'not', 'clowning', 'around', 'Instead', 'youngsters', 'untimely', 'doom', 'wily', 'kids', 'fight', 'back', 'evil', '30', 'years', 'later', 'meaner', 'angrier', 'dealier', 'friends', 'who', 'vividly', 'remember', 'youthful', 'terrors', 'reunite', 'battle', 'IT', 'Stephen', 'King', 'IT', 'become', 'horror', 'classic', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'miniseries', 'two-nighter', 'Running', 'little', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'designed', 'be', 'appropriate', 'average', 'Joe', 'tuning', 'original', 'broadcast', '1990', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'bit', 'stinker', 'means', 'IT', 'thrilling', 'darkly', 'charasmatic', 'adventure', 'one', 'very', 'terrifying', 'story', 'Great', 'script', 'great', 'directing', 'great', 'cast', 'best', 'part', 'Well', 'Remeber', 'Bozo', 'Ah', 'what', 'great', 'guy', 'How', 'about', 'Clarabell', 'even', 'Ronald', 'McDonald', 'Clowns', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'treat', 'entertainment', 'business', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'changed', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'film', 'Undeniably', 'star', 'show', 'freaky', 'amusement', 'inescapable', 'horror', 'Curry', 'really', 'helped', 'along', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'character', 'development', 'childhood', 'scenes', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'adults', 'really', 'viewer', 'interested', 'engaged', 'let', 'face', 'Curry', 'performance', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'missing', 'Luckily', ""'re"", 'given', 'plenty', 'delightfully', 'scary', 'scenes', 'showing', 'off', 'unforgettable', 'portrayal', 'history', 'most', 'malevolent', 'clown', 'film.By', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'characters', 'be', 'glued', 'screen', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'out', 'there', 'how', 'lot', 'time', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'overall', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'IT', 'just', 'many', 'King', 'writings', 'really', 'grabs', 'viewer', 'something', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'awe', 'mystery', 'childhood.Sadly', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'special', 'features', 'double-sided', 'disc', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'Dennis', 'Christopher', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'Director', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'why', 'Curry', 'probably', 'not', 'available', 'do', 'talk', 'bit', 'though', 'wonderful', 'crystal-clear', 'print', 'audio', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'almost', 'bear-bones', 'packaging', 'So', 'go', 'ahead', 'pick', 'baby', 'up', 'one', 'hell', 'ride', 'nightmare', 'where', 'fear']",N/A

Sure, it may be about 3 hours long, but it's so enjoyable it seems to go like an hour. Tim Curry, plays Pennywise the clown extremely well, he can be very similar to Freddy Kreugar (scary, but funny).The film is all about a couple of murders that are being commited in the small town of Maine. No one knows who is doing them, but there is one person who thinks he knows. He thinks it could be the work of &quot;It&quot;. He calls up a group of old childhood friends, and tells them &quot;It&quot; has returned. &quot;It&quot; was a clown, who lived in the sewers. He tried to have the group of kids killed when they were young, but he failed, and the kids killed him, but know he has returned. One by one, as he phones them, they all head to Maine, to stop &quot;It&quot;, who they tried to stop before when they were kids.The film starts off in present day, but when each of the frieds get the phone call off the man, we see flashbacks from each of them, from when they were kids, and how &quot;It&quot; tried to kill them. It's split into two parts. The first part is showing the kids' flashbacks, the second is showing the kids in present day, ready to stop &quot;It&quot; again.The film does have a fair share of shocks, and there can be some quite creepy and disturbing scenes.

104374,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,0790736039,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[5, 6]","'It' is a wonderful novel; one of King's best, and a real horror classic. It contains more depth and ingenuiety than most of his more recent (though still effective) horror offerings like 'Bag of Bones' and 'Black House', and a far more palpable sense of tension and mounting terror.As a movie - or, rather, a TV Miniseries, because there's a big difference - ""It"" also works well, up to a point. Retelling the tale of seven childhood friends who rid their hometown of Derry from an unspeakable child-killing monster, the friends must reassemble as adults to finally end the cycle of violence that began well before they were born.'TV Miniseries' is perhaps an unfair title, here, though, because it conjures up images of low-budget high-histrionic situations, invariably starring Joan Collins or that man that used to be in 'Knots Landing'. This is a TV Movie of a very different nature, and I also believe that, since it remains hugely faithful to the novel (aside from some obvious omissions that, even now, you couldn't get past the censors), the TV Movie format with its more generous time restrictions works better here than a cinematic release would have.The use of the flashback is a clever and sympathetic way of illustrating most of the childhood portion of the story, and Tommy Lee Wallace coaxes some really excellent performances out of child actors Jonathan Brandis (Bill Denbrough), Brandon Crane (Ben Hanscom) and particularly Emily Perkins as Beverly Marsh (who, fact fans, went on to be very good as Briget in those otherwise awful 'Ginger Snaps' movies). This trend of great performances continues when the adult cast is called into play, with Annette O' Toole, John Ritter and Tim Reid doing some great things with, it must be said, some pretty clunky dialogue. Lee Wallace's direction, too, is polished and fine, and - while there are some portions like the rock fight and the scenes with the adult Henry Bowers and Audra Denborough that feel very much like a TV Miniseries - the whole atmosphere is one of professional polish and excerllence.Tim Curry shines as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Sure, he's been typecast in pretty much everything as Camp Baddie since 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', but here, he's wonderful. Truly terrifying and totally immersed in his role, he brings a real sense of malevolence and life to a part that, in the hands of a lesser actor, could very easily have descended into schlock and parody. The opening scenes with Georgie Denborough and the library sequence with adult Richie Tozier still make the hair on my arms stand up today.The ending is something of a let-down, but it is pretty much a direct lift from the novel, so for that alone, it must be praised.Overall, an excellent production, and, outside of 'The Shining' and 'Carrie', a strong contender for the best King adaptation ever, 'It' is very deserving of a place in your horror movie collection. It is creepy, it is effective and it's very, very well-done.Read the novel first though!Recommended.",4,John Wayne Gacey meets Monty Python's Flying Circus,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,3015,"['wonderful', 'novel', 'one', 'King', 'best', 'real', 'horror', 'classic', 'more', 'depth', 'ingenuiety', 'most', 'more', 'recent', 'still', 'effective', 'horror', 'offerings', ""'Bag"", 'Bones', ""'Black"", 'House', 'far', 'more', 'palpable', 'sense', 'tension', 'mounting', 'terror.As', 'movie', 'rather', 'TV', 'Miniseries', 'big', 'difference', 'also', 'well', 'up', 'point', 'Retelling', 'tale', 'seven', 'childhood', 'friends', 'who', 'rid', 'hometown', 'Derry', 'unspeakable', 'child-killing', 'monster', 'friends', 'must', 'reassemble', 'adults', 'finally', 'end', 'cycle', 'violence', 'began', 'well', 'were', 'born', 'Miniseries', 'perhaps', 'unfair', 'title', 'here', 'though', 'up', 'images', 'low-budget', 'high-histrionic', 'situations', 'invariably', 'starring', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'man', 'used', 'be', ""'Knots"", 'Landing', 'TV', 'Movie', 'very', 'different', 'nature', 'also', 'believe', 'hugely', 'faithful', 'novel', 'obvious', 'omissions', 'even', 'now', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'censors', 'TV', 'Movie', 'format', 'more', 'generous', 'time', 'restrictions', 'better', 'here', 'cinematic', 'release', 'would', 'have.The', 'use', 'flashback', 'clever', 'sympathetic', 'way', 'illustrating', 'most', 'childhood', 'portion', 'story', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'coaxes', 'really', 'excellent', 'performances', 'child', 'actors', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'Bill', 'Denbrough', 'Brandon', 'Crane', 'Ben', 'Hanscom', 'particularly', 'Emily', 'Perkins', 'Beverly', 'Marsh', 'who', 'fact', 'fans', 'went', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'Briget', 'otherwise', 'awful', ""'Ginger"", 'Snaps', 'movies', 'trend', 'great', 'performances', 'when', 'adult', 'cast', 'called', 'play', 'Annette', 'O', 'Toole', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'doing', 'great', 'things', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'pretty', 'clunky', 'dialogue', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'direction', 'too', 'polished', 'fine', 'are', 'portions', 'rock', 'fight', 'scenes', 'adult', 'Henry', 'Bowers', 'Audra', 'Denborough', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'TV', 'Miniseries', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'professional', 'polish', 'excerllence.Tim', 'Curry', 'Pennywise', 'Dancing', 'Clown', 'Sure', 'been', 'typecast', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'Camp', 'Baddie', ""'The"", 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'here', 'wonderful', 'Truly', 'terrifying', 'totally', 'immersed', 'role', 'real', 'sense', 'malevolence', 'life', 'part', 'hands', 'lesser', 'actor', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'have', 'descended', 'schlock', 'parody', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Georgie', 'Denborough', 'library', 'sequence', 'adult', 'Richie', 'Tozier', 'still', 'make', 'hair', 'arms', 'stand', 'up', 'today.The', 'ending', 'something', 'let-down', 'pretty', 'much', 'direct', 'lift', 'novel', 'so', 'alone', 'must', 'be', 'praised.Overall', 'excellent', 'production', ""'The"", 'Shining', ""'Carrie"", 'strong', 'contender', 'best', 'King', 'adaptation', 'ever', ""'It"", 'very', 'deserving', 'place', 'horror', 'movie', 'collection', 'creepy', 'effective', 'very', 'very', 'well-done.Read', 'novel', 'first', 'Recommended']",N/A
104375,A17KWX1M2SIA89,0790736039,"Richard Harborough ""Rich""","[3, 3]","(There may be minor spoilers herein)The book 'It' is one of Stephen King's most enduring classics even if it is 500 pages too long. He establishes strong characters, strong scenarios, and frightening attacks over 1138 well-developed pages. The book is massive and gets silly at times, like most of King's work, but it still has the strength and power to outlast any minor issue.The movie, on the other hand, is not so good. Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, John Carpenter's close friend (editing Halloween and The Fog amongst other credits), the film lacks the power and depth that the book contained due to it's strange array of actors and overacting children with wooden dialog.There are good parts of the story however. Most of the 'Stand By Me'-esque story is done fairly well, considering. But where the story really seems strong is with the adults; most of the time. The ending is a bastardization of King's original story, making me cringe and wonder why there was ever a 30 year wait to try and destroy THAT evil.But the best part of this film adaptation is Pennywise the Dancing Clown as portrayed by Tim Curry, who plays the murdering vampiric clown with evil glee. He is most definitely the best part of the movie which makes it upsetting when he shows up sporadically. But when he does show up, he most certainly steals the scene.Since this is the only adaptation of 'It' out there, its definitely not the worst thing in the world, like I said, there are good parts. But it doesn't live up to the story and themes in the book. Themes that are as poignant as ever, no matter where and when you grew up. Themes of childhood, adulthood, and corruption. Themes of a dark town that hides it's evil secrets in a blurred past. The movie misses this, even at it's extended length. I can see how the film is loved; it's a nostalgic viewing for many. But for those of us who wish to remove those rose-tinted glasses, we see how flawed the film truly is.",2,Great Stephen King story with a Lacking Adaptation,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,1953,"['may', 'be', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'herein', 'book', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'most', 'enduring', 'classics', 'even', '500', 'pages', 'too', 'long', 'strong', 'characters', 'strong', 'scenarios', 'frightening', 'attacks', '1138', 'well-developed', 'pages', 'book', 'massive', 'silly', 'times', 'most', 'King', 'work', 'still', 'strength', 'power', 'outlast', 'minor', 'issue.The', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'Directed', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'close', 'friend', 'editing', 'Halloween', 'Fog', 'other', 'credits', 'film', 'power', 'depth', 'book', 'contained', 'due', 'strange', 'array', 'actors', 'overacting', 'children', 'wooden', 'are', 'good', 'parts', 'story', 'however', 'Most', ""'Stand"", ""Me'-esque"", 'story', 'done', 'fairly', 'well', 'considering', 'where', 'story', 'really', 'strong', 'adults', 'most', 'time', 'ending', 'bastardization', 'King', 'original', 'story', 'making', 'cringe', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'ever', '30', 'year', 'wait', 'try', 'destroy', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Pennywise', 'Dancing', 'Clown', 'portrayed', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'who', 'murdering', 'vampiric', 'clown', 'evil', 'glee', 'most', 'definitely', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'upsetting', 'when', 'up', 'sporadically', 'when', 'show', 'up', 'most', 'certainly', 'scene.Since', 'only', 'adaptation', ""'It"", 'there', 'definitely', 'not', 'worst', 'thing', 'world', 'said', 'are', 'good', 'parts', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'story', 'themes', 'book', 'Themes', 'are', 'as', 'poignant', 'ever', 'matter', 'where', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'Themes', 'childhood', 'adulthood', 'corruption', 'Themes', 'dark', 'town', 'evil', 'secrets', 'blurred', 'past', 'movie', 'even', 'extended', 'length', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'loved', 'nostalgic', 'viewing', 'many', 'who', 'wish', 'remove', 'rose-tinted', 'glasses', 'see', 'how', 'flawed', 'film', 'truly']",N/A

I've missed the creepy fun of some of those microbudget TV Feel-Bad Movies of the 70's; some of them, like Salem's Lot, or Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell, can really spook you if you watch them by yourself late at night.  Sadly, made-for-tv horror movies have really been atrocious since the dawn of videotape in the early 80's; there is something so desperately unfrightening and sterile about the look of movies shot on video that I'm not sure it would be possible to wrench any atmosphere out of a film shot in this format.  But in this case, the source material (one of Stephen King's throwaways) was so damn scary that it seemed almost impossible to screw it up.Unless, of course, you're Tommy Lee Wallace, the director of this mess.  I was convinced that this film was his sixth-grade honors project until I read his bio.  At first I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, and blame the actors, who are mostly elementary schoolers.  But perfectly fine performers, such as John Ritter, Richard Masur, Tim Curry, Annette O'Toole, and Seth Green perform their line readings as if they were acting in a low-budget porno.  And for most of the movie Wallace seems to just plop down the camera in front of these boobs, without any thought to composing the scene, and watch them overact, as if their cheesy shrieks and hand-wringing were enough to scare us silly.What's more amazing is that Wallace even neglects some of the basic tricks of the low-budget horror genre, that might have saved him if he had any instincts for suspense or terror.  The whole thing looks like it was shot with the (flourescent) lights on, and nearly the entire film takes place outside, on apparently the sunniest day of the year; even the underground sewers are lighted like someone's kitchen.  And the special effects are really bad; Wallace could've been more effective if he'd ditched all the fake blood, third-rate opticals, and jerky claymation in favor of 99 cent flashlights placed under the actors' chins.  In honesty, no one involved with this picture, least of all the director, the cinematographer, or the editor, seems to realize that they're making a horror film.  Scenes drag on interminably, sometimes to the point of catching the actors dropping out of character before someone yells ""cut"", and whenever a moment of fright is meant to be conveyed there is a close-up of Tim Curry in Kabuki makeup and plastic fangs going ""boo!"".I cannot imagine that anyone over the age of 4 could be frightened by this picture.  But then again, one Amazon user thought it was the best horror movie she ever saw--and if we assume she's seen Carrie, Rosemary's Baby, Nosferatu, Don't Look Now, Jaws, or something by real amateurs like, say, Hitchcock, that's quite a compliment.

""cinemaparker@twitter""","[25, 32]","I'm assuming that you've come here looking for a review on the DVD presentation of the film, right?THE BAD:The film originally aired in two parts on ABC, so this film is split over both sides of the disc. I'm not big on the whole flipping thing when it comes to DVDs but it's understandable here.... if only sort of.The thing that actually gets on my nerves about this DVD is that the disc doesn't tell you what side you're putting on. Looking at the disc, there is no indication of whether you're about to play side A or side B and it's annoying to have to wait until the disc is playing to see whether you're watching the right one. This in itself is just irresponsible on the part of the manufacturers.THE GOOD:Picture quality is good and the Dolby Surround sound is good also, if nothing awe inspiring. The film is presented nicely at the least.The DVD commentary by director Tommy Lee Wallace and actors Henry Thomas, Tim Reid, Dennis Christopher and the late John Ritter is actually a lot of fun. These guys laugh so much and have so much fun remembering their work on ""It"" that you can't help but crack up everytime someone makes a smart remark. John Ritter especially was a hoot to listen to and listening to this commentary made me a little melancholy to know he died so young.So there you have it. I happen to like this film, even if I prefer the book much more and the ending for the film was almost pathetic (admit it, that spider was just a big joke). Still, the film has a dynamite first half and great acting by not only the adults but the kids as well. It's genuinely frightening at times and Tim Curry makes for one scary clown.Not the best presentation in the world but I'd still recommend it, at least for the commentary.",3,Decent treatment for a creepy TV movie,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,1740,"[""'m"", 'assuming', ""'ve"", 'come', 'here', 'looking', 'review', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'film', 'right', 'BAD', 'film', 'originally', 'aired', 'two', 'parts', 'ABC', 'so', 'film', 'split', 'sides', 'disc', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'whole', 'flipping', 'thing', 'when', 'DVDs', 'understandable', 'here', 'only', 'of.The', 'thing', 'actually', 'nerves', 'DVD', 'disc', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'side', ""'re"", 'putting', 'Looking', 'disc', 'indication', ""'re"", 'play', 'side', 'A', 'side', 'B', 'annoying', 'have', 'wait', 'disc', 'playing', 'see', ""'re"", 'watching', 'right', 'one', 'just', 'irresponsible', 'part', 'manufacturers.THE', 'GOOD', 'Picture', 'quality', 'good', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'sound', 'good', 'also', 'nothing', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'film', 'presented', 'nicely', 'least.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Wallace', 'actors', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'Dennis', 'Christopher', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'actually', 'lot', 'fun', 'guys', 'laugh', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'remembering', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'crack', 'up', 'everytime', 'someone', 'smart', 'remark', 'John', 'Ritter', 'especially', 'was', 'hoot', 'listen', 'listening', 'commentary', 'made', 'little', 'melancholy', 'know', 'died', 'so', 'young.So', 'have', 'happen', 'like', 'film', 'even', 'prefer', 'book', 'much', 'more', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'pathetic', 'spider', 'was', 'just', 'big', 'joke', 'Still', 'film', 'dynamite', 'first', 'half', 'great', 'acting', 'not', 'only', 'adults', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'times', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'one', 'scary', 'best', 'presentation', 'world', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'least', 'commentary']",N/A

I found the ending was both abrupt and unclear.If this had been given the full mini-series treatment that ""The Stand"" received, it probably would have equalled it in quality (which was pretty good).  However, this film was just too short to give adequate coverage of the story.  If we'd seen more and longer details of the childrens' lives, it might have made more sense in the overall scheme of things - instead we get memory moments for each of them which are fleeting and not very descriptive.  They only serve to say ""This happened back then,"" rather than giving you a true feeling of what exactly went wrong.Tim Curry was good, but because no one really is given enough time to expand a character, his evil clown act comes off as being angry and stupid rather than creepy and threatening.I can't really say that this is worth buying.

104415,A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,0790736039,Todd7,"[1, 1]","It (1990) is one of Stephen King's shining (no pun intended) moments. Of course, I'm talking about the book, but I'm also talking about the movie. I love the setting of the movie (New England) which is so common with King's works, but the New England setting works especially well in this movie. If Pennywise the clown were haunting and terrorizing a big city, it wouldn't have worked as well. When watching the movie, it slowly dawns on the viewer to ask, ""Why here? Derry, Maine?"" Actually, Derry is a town in New Hampshire, but King creates a Derry, Maine in this film. I think that the acting of Richard Thomas is superb, as he really brings out a character in distress at times. His stuttering adds a special chill to the scenes, as this was a part of his childhood, and took place the same time his young brother, Georgie was killed. The movie is long, but that's because it's really 2 movies in 1 (30 years ago), then onto the present time. I think that this works very well, and gives the viewer a good feel for what the kids went through in facing Pennywise. A few flashbacks wouldn't have worked as well. I'm glad that the makers of the movie decided to show how these kids developed into their adult selves, whether it was through abusive parents, or being the victims of harrassment from their peers. I think that Pennywise's appearances in the film are not too much or too little. I think that it's better to show the villain less than show it more. This way, it keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, and creates a feeling of appreciation without wearing out ""IT'S"" welcome. The very beginning of the movie features a scene that is very similar to John Carpenter's Halloween, as Pennywise is behind hung clothes on a clothes line. This was the perfect intro to Pennywise, and gets into the psyche of the viewer right away. Overall, IT is a very good movie for the horror aficionado.

104417,A1XMDCDWXQTB5V,0790736039,Tommy Bennett,"[0, 4]","I feel King's success came from the ability to take cliches from the horror genre - be it vampires or mad dogs or just sudden violence - and give you really skillful dread, coupled with fear of loss of the characters you grew to care about. If you want a truly iconic trio of his works to get the full impact of his talent, read The Stand, The Shining and Salem's Lot. Truly brilliant stuff.When I saw that this monstrosity got four stars, as one of my recommendations, I did a double take. In all honesty, It was the last of his novels that I read. It was bulky - which I always thanked him for, so that the good ones lasted a long time - and yet empty of interest for me. I had been losing faith in his ideas over the course of several short story collections - The Mist and Apt Pupil excepted of course - and some dud novels. This was the proverbial straw that broke the King's back.I'm giving this two stars because Tim Curry was inspired. He is the penultimate villain. (Put himself and Gary Oldman in a film as competing bad guys, and you'll guarantee five stars from everyone.) I was going to give it three on his account, but dropped one because I remembered the sex magic ending that took lame to an entirely new level. Gag, puke, rowf.

Admittedly I haven't read the book, now more than ever, I'd like to. I have both formats of this film, vhs and DVD. The DVD is tolerable, except they took out Pennywise's demonic cackle at the end of part one, and with part two, the opening credits being removed wasn't really an issue, but taking out the first 5+ minutes didn't sit well with me. I hope with the remakes release that they'll restore it properly, and re-release it of course.Now, is the film worth watching if you haven't read the book? Honestly, I don't know yet, but w/out reading it myself and doing extensive research on the book, I can say that for a tv-movie, miniseries, it was pretty well done, the special f/x are oddly convincing...for their time anyway, in the time they had, they covered what they could and added a few scenes not even in the novel. Eddie's shower scene was pretty creepy though, made me terrified of taking a shower for months afterwards! I saw it for the first time at 12 years old, thinking I couldn't be scared. Boy! I was dead wrong!

Before buying this, I was not aware that this was a made for television 2 part special. You must flip this DVD middle way through the movie to see the second half. It is an outdated concept, really, and you would expect such a well known movie to have an updated disk by now!It is about a group of children who run into an evil clown. They must kill him and bring peace to their town. But little do they know, this will only keep the situation down for 30 years. The clown is back when they are adults! How will the defeat the clown once and for real? Well you must watch to see *insert evil laugh here*. The first half of the movie takes place in flash backs of the grown ups all individually remembering their part in killing and confronting the clown. The second half of the movie is about them meeting up after many years and going out to kill the clown again. I found the first half to be much more charming and entertaining, while the second half tended to drag on and the final scene was rather disappointing and not scary.For a television special, I found this movie to be be alright but nothing particularly memorable besides the Tim Curry's performance of It the clown. He was funny, creepy, and even made me jump at times. Classic! I also really enjoyed the children actors which included a young Seth Green, how cute. On the downside, some of the adult acting was rather weak and it was hard to take some scenes seriously. By the end of the movie, something seemed to be missing which kept this movie from being touching and moving.While I would not reccomend running out to see this movie, I did enjoy some scenes of this and thought it was a worthwhile if mostly forgettable watch.
