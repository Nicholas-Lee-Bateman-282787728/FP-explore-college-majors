Little did I know that this disk would not play in my blue ray player! I passed it on to a few of my friends & it didn't work in their players either.

The selection available is very limited. To date none of the DVD releases of T. J. Lubinsky & Shout Factory (the PBS series), or of B.E.T. Entertainment have made the transition to Blu-Ray.This disk by the O'Jays was a pleasant surprise. Lead singer Eddie Levert may no longer be as nimble on stage but is still very delightful to watch. Video quality of the disk is excellent. Audio is also very good except that the subwoofer of my sound system did not kick in throughout the entire concert.

An outstanding vocal performance by Whitney, and her exchange with the audience was truly endearing.It brought back memories of a number of live concerts I was able to attend, and will always remember.  This is a keeper and something I will always treasure.  Her smile, laugh, beyond beautiful voice and heart of gold.  Whitney was a remarkable lady and a true gift to the world.The order arrived much earlier than expected and in mint condition. No problems with color or sound.

947097,A16SCNAE4T5WLR,B000BP2YA8,V. Organ,"[9, 10]","I'm not really certain where some of these reviews are coming from or what compels the writers to give this show such low ratings and harsh reviews. This show was filmed in 1993, long before the realm of high definition or even the popularity of 720p video. If the viewer is willing to look beyond that, they'll find that this IS a highly viewable and enjoyable Chicago concert, even though it was filmed in Japan.The horn section was stellar, as was Robert Lamm, Jason Scheff and the entire band. I also have to give kudos to Dwayne Bailey who gives one of the best live performances I've ever seen from him and an ultra-surreal guitar solo that leaves the mind wondering if this man is 100% human. There are also parts of the show that briefly make you wonder if jet-lag didn't play some small part in the energy delivered in their show. Nevertheless, Chicago delivers the quality performance that has come to be expected of them.The following song lineup is a well-arranged list of favorites dating back to the beginning of their extensive and successful careers:Alive AgainStay The NightYou're Not AloneSaturday In The ParkFeeling Stronger Every DayIf You Leave Me NowHard Habit To BreakLook AwayBeginningsJust You'n'MeHappy ManI'm A ManDoes Anybody Really Know What Time It IsSolo Dawayne BaileyDialogueHard To Say I'm SorryYou're The Inspiration25 Or 6 To 4You can believe anything you want when it comes to these reviews as beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However, if you are willing to forget about the high definition aspect of film quality we see these days and take a moment to ponder a small piece of nostalgia from yesteryear (not unlike enjoying a vinyl album every once in a while), then you will not be disappointed with this DVD purchase. I bought my copy in 'Used-Like New' condition from a private seller for whom Amazon actually fulfilled the order. Thus, I am very pleased with my purchase, the delivery and the quality of the lightly used DVD. It was received just as advertised, 'Used-Like New', money well-spent in my humble opinion. My 4-Star rating instead of 5-Star comes as a result of mediocre production at the very end of the concert. The film ends fairly abruptly after 25 or 6 to 4, which did not affect the song in any way. I simply think they could have fared a bit better in that area. Nonetheless, it's a DVD that I am glad to have in my extensive concert collection and will replay again and again in the future.Enjoy my friends, ENJOY!",4,This is not a bad show as some suggest!,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,2480,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'certain', 'where', 'reviews', 'are', 'coming', 'what', 'writers', 'give', 'show', 'such', 'low', 'ratings', 'harsh', 'reviews', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', '1993', 'long', 'realm', 'high', 'definition', 'even', 'popularity', '720p', 'video', 'viewer', 'willing', 'look', ""'ll"", 'find', 'highly', 'viewable', 'enjoyable', 'Chicago', 'concert', 'even', 'was', 'filmed', 'Japan.The', 'horn', 'section', 'was', 'stellar', 'was', 'Robert', 'Lamm', 'Jason', 'Scheff', 'entire', 'band', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'kudos', 'Dwayne', 'Bailey', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'live', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'ultra-surreal', 'guitar', 'solo', 'mind', 'wondering', 'man', '100', '%', 'human', 'are', 'also', 'parts', 'show', 'briefly', 'make', 'wonder', 'jet-lag', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'small', 'part', 'energy', 'delivered', 'show', 'Nevertheless', 'Chicago', 'quality', 'performance', 'come', 'be', 'expected', 'them.The', 'following', 'song', 'lineup', 'well-arranged', 'list', 'favorites', 'dating', 'back', 'beginning', 'extensive', 'successful', 'careers', 'Alive', 'AgainStay', 'NightYou', ""'re"", 'Not', 'AloneSaturday', 'ParkFeeling', 'Stronger', 'Every', 'DayIf', 'Leave', 'Me', 'NowHard', 'Habit', 'BreakLook', 'AwayBeginningsJust', ""n'MeHappy"", 'ManI', ""'m"", 'A', 'ManDoes', 'Anybody', 'Really', 'Know', 'What', 'Time', 'IsSolo', 'Dawayne', 'BaileyDialogueHard', 'Say', ""'m"", 'SorryYou', ""'re"", 'Inspiration25', '6', '4You', 'can', 'believe', 'anything', 'want', 'when', 'reviews', 'beauty', 'eye', 'beholder', 'However', 'are', 'willing', 'forget', 'high', 'definition', 'aspect', 'film', 'quality', 'see', 'days', 'take', 'moment', 'ponder', 'small', 'piece', 'nostalgia', 'yesteryear', 'not', 'enjoying', 'vinyl', 'album', 'once', 'while', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'bought', 'copy', ""'Used-Like"", 'New', 'condition', 'private', 'seller', 'whom', 'Amazon', 'actually', 'fulfilled', 'order', 'Thus', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'purchase', 'delivery', 'quality', 'lightly', 'used', 'DVD', 'was', 'received', 'just', 'advertised', ""'Used-Like"", 'New', 'money', 'well-spent', 'humble', 'opinion', '4-Star', 'rating', 'instead', '5-Star', 'result', 'mediocre', 'production', 'very', 'end', 'concert', 'film', 'fairly', 'abruptly', '25', '6', '4', 'did', 'not', 'affect', 'song', 'way', 'simply', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'fared', 'bit', 'better', 'area', 'Nonetheless', 'DVD', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'extensive', 'concert', 'collection', 'will', 'replay', 'again', 'again', 'future.Enjoy', 'friends', 'ENJOY']",N/A
