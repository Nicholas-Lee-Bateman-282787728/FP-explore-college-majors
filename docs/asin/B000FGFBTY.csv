989627,AEWYUPCNDV7HY,B000FGFBTY,"Modern Blue Argonaut ""No I do not have a shoe...","[23, 23]",In this day and age when there are so many angry young youths and spoiled rotten youths this movie can help bring into focus what is important and also help to show the youth that their hardships are not as great as they may seem. The movie is set in the depression era in rural Tennessee before civil rights. It shows racism and the hardships faced by a poor uneducated white family and a poor black family. Lack of food and education are central as well as domestic violence and prostition although the prostition part is tastefully depicted and should not upset or concern younger children. Whether or not you have faced these hardships yourself you should be able to relate to the characters and their problems and feel their pain. This is a wonderfully directed movie with a rich landscape of authenticity. I highly recommend this movie for anyone with a heart and those who are searching for one.,5,Excellent movie in this day & age,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,902,"['day', 'age', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'angry', 'young', 'youths', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'youths', 'movie', 'can', 'help', 'bring', 'focus', 'what', 'important', 'also', 'help', 'show', 'youth', 'hardships', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'may', 'seem', 'movie', 'set', 'depression', 'era', 'rural', 'Tennessee', 'civil', 'rights', 'racism', 'hardships', 'faced', 'poor', 'uneducated', 'white', 'family', 'poor', 'black', 'family', 'Lack', 'food', 'education', 'are', 'central', 'as', 'well', 'domestic', 'violence', 'prostition', 'prostition', 'part', 'tastefully', 'depicted', 'should', 'not', 'upset', 'concern', 'younger', 'children', 'Whether', 'not', 'have', 'faced', 'hardships', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'characters', 'problems', 'feel', 'pain', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'movie', 'rich', 'landscape', 'authenticity', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'heart', 'who', 'are', 'searching', 'one']",Chasing Secrets

Chasing Secrets is the type of movie that tears at your heartstrings.  Della Reese is excellent as ""Honey"" a woman who has lost her own child and she takes in this abused white girl who is forced, by her abusive grandfather to do things no 14 year old should have to face.  Ossie Davis is his usual loveable character and plays well opposite Della Reese.  Crystal Bernard's character is also played well, as the misguided young mother.

989633,AIWA57W45A0AX,B000FGFBTY,Victoria C. Wood,"[39, 39]","One of my favorite movies, and the story may be applicable to many of today's families. A well-to-do mother of two privileged teenage daughters finds them too prideful for her liking, so decides to show them their roots. She takes them to the place where she grew up, and tells them about the squalor and abuse of her own childhood--something they had previously known nothing about. The story unfolds about an elderly black couple who loved her, taught her, and gave her a chance at a real life. Warm, touching, and absorbing--and they do it without putting anything in that the whole family can't watch.",5,"If Della Reese is in it, it's going to be good",1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,605,"['One', 'favorite', 'movies', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'applicable', 'many', 'today', 'families', 'well-to-do', 'mother', 'two', 'privileged', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'too', 'prideful', 'liking', 'so', 'show', 'roots', 'place', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'squalor', 'abuse', 'own', 'childhood', 'something', 'had', 'previously', 'known', 'nothing', 'story', 'elderly', 'black', 'couple', 'who', 'loved', 'taught', 'gave', 'chance', 'real', 'life', 'Warm', 'touching', 'absorbing', 'do', 'putting', 'anything', 'whole', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch']",Chasing Secrets
