""adahl-Korean drama enthusiast""","[0, 1]","I am really enjoying watching the trials and tribulations of up and coming dancers in this series about a ballet school in Austrailia. It is well done and the episodes run smoothly and quickly. I am getting ready to start Season 2. Hope it is even better. I am glad in the approach to cover real situations for young people under huge pressure to be perfect in all ways. Covering eating disorder is quite honest as this is a terrible illness hitting young people especially where body image is one of the big stresses. In some ways these actors are quite large looking for the average ballerina who is forced to keep weight abnormally low to prevent developement and also to remain light for the continuous lifts involved. Not easy to lift a 130 lb. woman. Also, the competition between the dancers is realistic.",4,Great cast,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,812,"['am', 'really', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'coming', 'dancers', 'series', 'ballet', 'school', 'Austrailia', 'well', 'done', 'episodes', 'run', 'smoothly', 'quickly', 'am', 'getting', 'ready', 'start', 'Season', '2', 'Hope', 'even', 'better', 'am', 'glad', 'approach', 'cover', 'real', 'situations', 'young', 'people', 'huge', 'pressure', 'be', 'perfect', 'ways', 'Covering', 'eating', 'disorder', 'quite', 'honest', 'terrible', 'illness', 'hitting', 'young', 'people', 'especially', 'where', 'body', 'image', 'one', 'big', 'stresses', 'ways', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'large', 'looking', 'average', 'ballerina', 'who', 'forced', 'keep', 'weight', 'abnormally', 'low', 'prevent', 'developement', 'also', 'remain', 'light', 'continuous', 'lifts', 'involved', 'Not', 'easy', 'lift', '130', 'lb', 'woman', 'Also', 'competition', 'dancers', 'realistic']",Dance Academy: Complete Season 1 [PAL]

I grew up dancing and I also grew up partially in Sydney, so there is just more reason for me to love this show. Beautiful Sydney setting and the cute story line about a sweet country girl, Tara, who came to the big city to be a dancer. As always like in any TV show, there is a villain, Abigail, Tara's roommate, without whom life would be just too easy. The dancers may not be the best in the world, nor they are the typical skinny ballet dancer body types, but they are gorgeous anyway when they dance.

They resolve their issues fairly quickly too, I think that the show needs more mystery or cliffhangers.
