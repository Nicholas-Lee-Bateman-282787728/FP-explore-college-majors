1614241,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00ANGIC4W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","I tend to get a bit worried when I come across a low budget indie such as ""Gun Hill Road,"" which has an important message of unqualified love and acceptance.  Sometimes these earnest endeavors can lack a subtlety and realness in their characterizations and they often go for what I like to call BIG MESSAGE MOMENTS.  So I was pleasantly surprised by the restraint first time writer/director Rashaad Ernesto Green brings to the proceedings.  It is a movie that could have devolved into easy stereotypes, but instead the screenplay keeps things focused on a family that is refreshingly multi-layered and believable.  Perhaps not everything is perfect (the boyfriend storyline occasionally strained credibility in its presentation), but Green demonstrates a big heart for his flawed characters.  And it is this clear vision and even-handed tone that allows ""Gun Hill Road"" to work quite well.  I didn't know anything about the film before watching it, and it's a solid recommendation.I've been a fan of Esai Morales ever since ""La Bamba"" (man, that was a long time ago) and I've always thought he should be a bigger star!  Here, he plays a man being released from prison who attempts to reconnect with his family.  He wants to do the right thing, be a good person, but the influences of his past life are never far away.  His wife (Judy Reyes of Scrubs) and son (Harmony Santana) have moved on with their own lives but must adapt to having Morales home again.  It's a delicate balance and a precarious one.  A major source of tension is Santana's exploration of his gender identity.  Not the boy that Morales remembers, he must adapt to the fact that his son sees himself as more female than male.  This, of course, ignites all manner of prejudice and disappointment.  And the movie is about how these three characters can reconcile with one another, especially in the unforgiving environment of the streets.Santana carries much of the movie and was, in fact, nominated as Best Supporting Actress at the Independent Spirit Awards.  She has a certain naturalness and authenticity that works for the character.  But I really liked Morales.  Why?  He is not pigeonholed into a good guy role or a bad guy role, he simply is who he is.  His struggles (both in the neighborhood and in his family) feel realistic and he's just trying to do the best that he can.  He doesn't always make the right choices, but he is never painted as a villain (and, unfortunately, that's what we see far too often in other pictures exploring similar themes).  In the end, ""Gun Hill Road"" is both effective and sensitive in portraying its complex characters.  So you'll actually care about the outcome of the film because you're rooting for these people, foibles and all.
