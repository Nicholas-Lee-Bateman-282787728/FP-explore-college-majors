In fact on one DVD there was a warning about video being from historical...The quality is better than off the air recordings. The images are a little fuzzy - not that crisp. There are artifacts which indicates DVDs were not cut from the original.The first episode on each disk has opening for NBC Sunday night movies which advertises Columbo, Hec Ramsey, McCloud, as well as McMillan... In other words there are two episodes per disk.The above comments applies to SERIES FIVE as well (since 5 has 7 episodes the 4th disk has only one episode).All said, it's better than not having any video.",2,video quality is poor,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,673,"['IMHO', 'compared', 'other', 'made', 'TV', 'DVD', 'quality', 'video', 'not', 'good', 'fact', 'one', 'DVD', 'was', 'warning', 'video', 'being', 'historical', 'quality', 'better', 'air', 'recordings', 'images', 'are', 'little', 'fuzzy', 'not', 'crisp', 'are', 'artifacts', 'DVDs', 'were', 'not', 'cut', 'original.The', 'first', 'episode', 'disk', 'opening', 'NBC', 'Sunday', 'night', 'movies', 'Columbo', 'Hec', 'Ramsey', 'McCloud', 'as', 'well', 'McMillan', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'two', 'episodes', 'disk.The', 'comments', 'applies', 'SERIES', 'FIVE', 'well', '5', '7', '4th', 'disk', 'only', 'one', 'episode', '.All', 'said', 'better', 'not', 'having', 'video']",Mcmillan & Wife Season 4

The series about a San Francisco police commisioner who solves crimes alongside his beautiful wife starred movie great Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James and ran for a total of six seasons. Saint James was absent from the final year due to a contract dispute when the actress wanted more money. The series was retitlted simply ""McMillan"" and due to terrible ratings ultimately cancelled.Season four was the year Sally became pregnant.

1429988,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B004VK759Y,trebe,"[0, 0]","An original component of NBC's Mystery Movie lineup, McMillan and Wife features Rock Hudson (Ice Station Zebra,Giant) as San Francisco Police Commissioner Stuart `Mac' McMillan, and Susan Saint James (Kate And Allie), as his wife and crime-solving partner, Sally.  The big development in season four (1974-75), is that due to the pregnancy of Susan Saint James, Sally is also pregnant for five of the six episodes.  In the season finale it is intimated that Sally has given birth to a son, who strangely, is never seen in the remainder of the series.Sally's pregnancy doesn't keep her from taking a very active role, particularly early on, as she seems to be more involved, than inseason three.  The slightly goofy sergeant Charles Enright (John Schuck) remains Mac's right hand man, and crusty housekeeper Mildred (Nancy Walker), is never shy about offering her opinions.  Mixing romance, mystery, humor, and action, and featuring a solid list of guest stars, McMillan and Wife maintains its appeal for mystery lovers, with more unusual and exciting adventures.  All six episodes are two hour productions, with a runtime of about 98 minutes each.The McMillan's are one of several teams participating in a rally race, in ""Downshift To Danger"".  Unfortunately, someone is sabotaging the vehicles, and putting the racers at risk. (Rating: 3 stars)""The Game of Survival"" is a more straightforward whodunit, where a newspaper tycoon is murdered, and a tennis player who is a friend of Sally's, is the prime suspect. (Rating: 4 stars)""Buried Alive"", is a cloak and dagger affair, where Mac's past history in military intelligence is featured again, as a former comrade is murdered, and Mac's ex-commander unexpectedly appears on the scene.  This one is complicated, and a little too clever.  The pieces that don't quite fit, but it is still better than average.  (Rating: 3.5 stars)While serving on a jury, Mildred is attacked, and another juror is murdered in ""Guilt By Association"".  Sally often wore a red football jersey with the number 18, as a nightgown.  In the mid 70's, Gene Washington, presently an executive with the NFL, was a star receiver for the 49ers, and wore the number 18.  Washington also had an interest in acting, and he appears in this episode, as a football player suspected of murder.  With a lot happening, Mac has to work extra hard to solve this complicated case. (Rating: 3.5 stars)In ""Night Train to L.A., the obnoxious author of a book about crooked cops, becomes a homicide victim, while travelling on a train loaded with cops.  Mac, Mildred, and Enright, are also part of the group, who were bound for a convention in Los Angeles.  Set on a train, the story is a little slow moving, and doesn't play fair with the viewer.  (Rating: 3 stars)In ""Love, Honor, And Swindle"", Sally has given birth to a son (who will never be seen).  Mac's mother (Mildred Natwick) arrives in town, with the news that her daughter (Gretchen Corbett), is getting married to man (David Birney) who might be a thief.  As Mac prepares for his sister's wedding, a complicated mystery emerges. (Rating: 4 stars)Season Four is notable for Sally's pregnancy.  While the writers keep her well out of harm's way, Susan Saint James is still prominently involved in the first four episodes.  The romance between the couple remains, but it is toned down.  Despite the challenges, Season Four is probably one of the stronger in the series.Due to some issues with the quality of the source material, image quality is soft in places.  Unfortunately, the episodes are not subtitled, and like the previous seasons, there are no bonus features.  While not perfect, fans of this classic series should appreciate that it is available on DVD, and also that the set has come down in price since its initial release.  In comparison, the series McCloud has not fared as well, as at this time, seasons three through seven are only available on Region 2 DVD.",4,"a pregnant Sally gives birth to a phantom child, in season four of McMillan and Wife...",1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,3937,"['original', 'component', 'NBC', 'Mystery', 'Movie', 'lineup', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'features', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Ice', 'Station', 'Zebra', 'Giant', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Police', 'Commissioner', 'Stuart', 'Mac', 'McMillan', 'Susan', 'Saint', 'James', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'wife', 'crime-solving', 'partner', 'Sally', 'big', 'development', 'season', 'four', '1974-75', 'due', 'pregnancy', 'Susan', 'Saint', 'James', 'Sally', 'also', 'pregnant', 'five', 'six', 'episodes', 'season', 'finale', 'intimated', 'Sally', 'given', 'birth', 'son', 'who', 'strangely', 'never', 'seen', 'remainder', 'series.Sally', 'pregnancy', ""n't"", 'keep', 'taking', 'very', 'active', 'role', 'particularly', 'early', 'be', 'more', 'involved', 'inseason', 'three', 'slightly', 'goofy', 'sergeant', 'Charles', 'Enright', 'John', 'Schuck', 'Mac', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'crusty', 'housekeeper', 'Mildred', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'never', 'shy', 'offering', 'opinions', 'Mixing', 'romance', 'mystery', 'humor', 'action', 'featuring', 'solid', 'list', 'guest', 'stars', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'appeal', 'mystery', 'lovers', 'more', 'unusual', 'exciting', 'adventures', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'two', 'hour', 'productions', 'runtime', '98', 'minutes', 'each.The', 'McMillan', 'are', 'one', 'several', 'teams', 'participating', 'rally', 'race', 'Downshift', 'Danger', 'Unfortunately', 'someone', 'sabotaging', 'vehicles', 'putting', 'racers', 'risk', 'Rating', '3', 'stars', 'Game', 'Survival', 'more', 'straightforward', 'whodunit', 'where', 'newspaper', 'tycoon', 'murdered', 'tennis', 'player', 'who', 'friend', 'Sally', 'prime', 'suspect', 'Rating', '4', 'stars', 'Buried', 'Alive', 'cloak', 'dagger', 'affair', 'where', 'Mac', 'past', 'history', 'military', 'intelligence', 'featured', 'again', 'former', 'comrade', 'murdered', 'Mac', 'ex-commander', 'unexpectedly', 'scene', 'one', 'complicated', 'little', 'too', 'clever', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'still', 'better', 'average', 'Rating', '3.5', 'stars', 'serving', 'jury', 'Mildred', 'attacked', 'juror', 'murdered', 'Guilt', 'Association', 'Sally', 'often', 'wore', 'red', 'football', 'jersey', 'number', '18', 'nightgown', 'mid', '70', 'Gene', 'Washington', 'presently', 'executive', 'NFL', 'was', 'star', 'receiver', '49ers', 'wore', 'number', '18', 'Washington', 'also', 'had', 'interest', 'acting', 'episode', 'football', 'player', 'suspected', 'murder', 'lot', 'happening', 'Mac', 'work', 'extra', 'hard', 'solve', 'complicated', 'case', 'Rating', '3.5', 'stars', 'Night', 'Train', 'L.A.', 'obnoxious', 'author', 'book', 'crooked', 'cops', 'homicide', 'victim', 'travelling', 'train', 'loaded', 'cops', 'Mac', 'Mildred', 'Enright', 'are', 'also', 'part', 'group', 'who', 'were', 'bound', 'convention', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Set', 'train', 'story', 'little', 'slow', 'moving', ""n't"", 'play', 'fair', 'viewer', 'Rating', '3', 'stars', 'Love', 'Honor', 'Swindle', 'Sally', 'given', 'birth', 'son', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'Mac', 'mother', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'town', 'news', 'daughter', 'Gretchen', 'Corbett', 'getting', 'married', 'man', 'David', 'Birney', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'thief', 'Mac', 'sister', 'wedding', 'complicated', 'mystery', 'emerges', 'Rating', '4', 'stars', 'Season', 'Four', 'notable', 'Sally', 'pregnancy', 'writers', 'keep', 'well', 'harm', 'way', 'Susan', 'Saint', 'James', 'still', 'prominently', 'involved', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'romance', 'couple', 'toned', 'down', 'challenges', 'Season', 'Four', 'probably', 'one', 'stronger', 'series.Due', 'issues', 'quality', 'source', 'material', 'image', 'quality', 'soft', 'places', 'Unfortunately', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'subtitled', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'not', 'perfect', 'fans', 'classic', 'series', 'should', 'appreciate', 'available', 'DVD', 'also', 'set', 'come', 'down', 'price', 'initial', 'release', 'comparison', 'series', 'McCloud', 'not', 'fared', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'seasons', 'three', 'seven', 'are', 'only', 'available', 'Region', '2', 'DVD']",Mcmillan & Wife Season 4
