His voice doesn't sound like Hank to me. His singing lacks Hank's straight from the heart charm, pain, and joy. The film is a bore and is cheaply filmed.

There's really no plot, and very little acting. It's more like a one man show. The set-up is that Hank is on his way to his last gig on Earth, and while traveling he imagines what his New Year's Eve show could be like. Through Sneezy Water's dialogue, he touches on all the well known parts of Hank's career, which sets up a song performance of a related Hank song. The production of the film (the grain of the film, few sets, etc.) looks like it was shot on a small budget. I didn't think Sneezy was that impressive as Hank. He wasn't bad, he just wasn't great - and he certainly was older than the age when Hank died. I found myself forwarding through the dialogue and listening to the music. Hank certainly had a vast catalog of songs! Speaking of music, it was good to see the musicians actually able to play their instruments, or at least fake it convincingly. For me, this production would work much better as a stage play, similar to ""Always Patsy Cline,"" or ""The Millionaire Dollar Quartet.""

As Hank did in real life, the actor/performer talked a lot about Hank's life and related those stories to the songs he wrote. Though there is a lot of controversy over Hank's death (did he pass away in the car or in a hotel?), this video takes the former approach with Hank doing some reflecting on his life and songs. The music is very well done though I suspect if other viewers are like me they will want more and they won't like some of our favorites being cut short. Sort of like Hank's short life leaving us wanting more. However, if they did these full length, this video would be several hours long.

The performance is solid and worthy of applause.  The film itself , a Canadian production, is exceptionally well shot, and conveys the story of a dream about a show that the famed country singer never performed.  We are in fact looking at Hank Williams' final thoughts regarding his own reflections on his life.  We area also given insight to his personal life, his strengths and weaknesses.It's a magnificent film, which is why I have to give some negative points about the current version that's available, but the DVD authoring could have been a bit better.  We're given a full screen presentation of what looks like a 16mm print of a 35mm film.  The image definition isn't that good, and the sound is professional enough, but it leaves the viewer to wonder if there isn't a more high fidelity print somewhere waiting to hit the blu-ray market.I've seen this film several times, and always come away with a sense of loss at the end of it.  One wishes Hank Williams had conquered his demons in some other way, and had found someone to better guard his health.  But, history has left us his legacy, and this film to pay homage to that legacy.Either way, check it out at the library, or buy yourself a copy here, an enjoy the theatre that is a tribute to the legendary Hank Williams.",4,"Excellent film, with a so so DVD transfer.",1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,1399,"['Sneezy', 'Waters', 'loosely', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'senior', 'Hillbilly', 'Shakespeare', 'certainly', 'sounds', 'performance', 'solid', 'worthy', 'applause', 'film', 'Canadian', 'production', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'shot', 'conveys', 'story', 'dream', 'show', 'famed', 'country', 'singer', 'never', 'performed', 'are', 'fact', 'looking', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'final', 'thoughts', 'regarding', 'own', 'reflections', 'life', 'area', 'also', 'given', 'insight', 'personal', 'life', 'strengths', 'weaknesses.It', 'magnificent', 'film', 'why', 'have', 'give', 'negative', 'points', 'current', 'version', 'available', 'DVD', 'authoring', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', ""'re"", 'given', 'full', 'screen', 'presentation', 'what', '16mm', 'print', '35mm', 'film', 'image', 'definition', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'sound', 'professional', 'enough', 'viewer', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'more', 'high', 'fidelity', 'print', 'somewhere', 'waiting', 'hit', 'blu-ray', 'market.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'always', 'come', 'away', 'sense', 'loss', 'end', 'One', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'had', 'conquered', 'demons', 'other', 'way', 'had', 'found', 'someone', 'better', 'guard', 'health', 'history', 'left', 'legacy', 'film', 'pay', 'homage', 'legacy.Either', 'way', 'check', 'out', 'library', 'buy', 'copy', 'here', 'enjoy', 'theatre', 'tribute', 'legendary', 'Hank', 'Williams']",N/A
