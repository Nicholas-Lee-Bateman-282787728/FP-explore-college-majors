There's also a lot of surprisingly raunchy humor (since these cartoons were made for adult soldiers, not little kiddies...) and fans of risque or censored art will find a lot to enjoy here.  It's a great glimpse into the concerns of the time -- presented by some of the greatest animators of the WWII era.BTW - I think the featured review, written by Michael Phillips, may not be written about this DVD... It goes on at great length about sound problems and navigational glitches that I didn't experience while viewing this collection.  He also refers to a cartoon that is not included in this collection... So, it may be a bad review that was written for another product altogether.  Anyway, I'd take the negative comments about this disc with a grain of salt...

460662,A2ABOYIEYJN7VD,6305339856,G. Cepeda,"[4, 5]","The sad fact is that this is probably the best Private SNAFU collection  that there ever will be.  The Powers-That-Be in our government and at WB never intended for these films to be seen by the public and the film elements simply were not taken very well care of as a consequence.  Most of the shorts are in fair to good condition with  a few almost approaching excellent shape.  No question there are scratches on the film and occasional hissing on the soundtracks, but would do you expect for 60+ year-old films that weren't kept under the best archival conditions?Those facts aside, it is still a fine collection of War Era cartoons and a very funny one at that.  The bawdiness in these shorts doesn't even begin to approach the typical South Park episode so the collection is probably safe for anybody over 15.  As for those who are younger, let the parents beware and use their best judgment when youngsters are around.  As it is, I think most of the humor will go over the heads of kids younger than 10.Yes, some of these shorts have appeared as extras on the Looney Tunes Collections on DVD and the older Golden Age of Looney Tunes laserdiscs but even the Warners' releases of the SNAFU shorts really aren't in better shape than the copies presented on the SNAFU DVD set released by Bosko Video.Enjoy folks and stop b**ching about things that can't be changed.

To do this they used the Animation Team at Warner Bros. Studios. They created a soldier named Private SNAFU (Situation Normal All F***ed Up!). After the misadventures of this loser, the hope was that the real soldiers watching would do things the opposite way. Some of these cartoons have been released before and many on Cartoon collection DVDs.  But this is the entire series, for the first time.  It is vastly entertaining, instructive and a very good window into the manners of that long-ago time (over 68 years).  I recommend this DVD.
