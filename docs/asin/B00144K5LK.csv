When I found this 'first four seasons' set I thrilled at the chance and devoured the DVDs once I had them, going back for a second viewing with commentaries, loving it.  But now for the bad news...once the appetite is whetted one wants the rest of the show...seasons 5 through 12...but they're nowhere to be found.  That is, nowhere 'legit'.  You can take a flyer on pirated versions (like I did) and if you do you'll be sorry.  I bought one set from an outfit that suggested it was in London, England; but the dvds came from Beijing, China and they're crap even when they do play (and not all of them do).  When are the suits at Fox and Bochco Productions going to get off their butts and release the rest of the series?",5,"Awsome, but a cheat",1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,839,"['gave', 'up', 'televison', 'more', 'decade', 'ago', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'missed', 'most', 'were', 're-runs', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'When', 'found', ""'first"", 'four', 'seasons', 'set', 'thrilled', 'chance', 'devoured', 'DVDs', 'once', 'had', 'going', 'back', 'second', 'viewing', 'commentaries', 'loving', 'now', 'bad', 'news', 'once', 'appetite', 'whetted', 'one', 'rest', 'show', 'seasons', '5', '12', ""'re"", 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'nowhere', ""'legit"", 'can', 'take', 'flyer', 'pirated', 'versions', 'did', 'do', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorry', 'bought', 'one', 'set', 'outfit', 'suggested', 'was', 'London', 'England', 'dvds', 'came', 'Beijing', 'China', ""'re"", 'crap', 'even', 'when', 'do', 'play', 'not', 'do', 'When', 'are', 'suits', 'Fox', 'Bochco', 'Productions', 'going', 'get', 'off', 'butts', 'release', 'rest', 'series']",NYPD Blue - Seasons 1-4

1145140,ALD1CRUBY1365,B00144K5LK,R. L. MILLER,"[15, 15]","I just finished watching the Pilot Episode of Season One after receiving this ""box set"" a couple of days ago, and I had to laugh at the famous confrontation between Sipowicz and ADA Sylvia Costas outside the courtroom where the judge let mobster Giardello walk. Little did any of us know when we saw it first-run on TV that it was a prelude to a courtship, no less! So much that Costas became the only person to be able to correct Andy's speech. For example, after they are married, one episode depicts Andy referring to people from India as ""dotheads"", only to have Costas chide him gently; ""Now Andy, I've told you before about that kind of talk."". Sipowicz's response isn't the kind of bluster Costas got from him when they first met--instead it's a shamefaced ""sorry"".This set is only the first 4 seasons, and I'm not seeing the other 8 seasons in any form--individually or in other box sets. I see Season 5 available in streaming, but that's it. The later seasons are where Sipowicz ""grows up""--he's still satisfyingly rude, but not a complete nihilist anymore. Which is proven when his last boss (in these first 4 seasons, he can't get along with brass at all) recommends him as his successor for command of the squad. There's an outfit in Canada that has the complete series, but caveat emptor! I bought ""Paper Chase"" from them because I couldn't find anything beyond the first two ABC seasons here, and that 12-disc set has some defective discs. Plus they have a nasty habit of cramming 5 or 6 episodes on a disc, which doesn't work unless you use dual-layer discs, which they don't. I don't understand why they're still sitting on the last 8 seasons of an ""official version"" of this series.",4,Why Is This Series Still Incomplete On DVD?,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,1699,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Pilot', 'Episode', 'Season', 'One', 'receiving', 'box', 'set', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'had', 'laugh', 'famous', 'confrontation', 'Sipowicz', 'ADA', 'Sylvia', 'Costas', 'courtroom', 'where', 'judge', 'let', 'mobster', 'Giardello', 'walk', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'when', 'saw', 'first-run', 'TV', 'was', 'prelude', 'courtship', 'less', 'So', 'much', 'Costas', 'became', 'only', 'person', 'be', 'able', 'correct', 'Andy', 'speech', 'example', 'are', 'married', 'one', 'episode', 'Andy', 'referring', 'people', 'India', 'dotheads', 'only', 'have', 'Costas', 'chide', 'gently', 'Now', 'Andy', ""'ve"", 'told', 'kind', 'talk.', 'Sipowicz', 'response', ""n't"", 'kind', 'bluster', 'Costas', 'got', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'instead', 'shamefaced', 'sorry', '.This', 'set', 'only', 'first', '4', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'seeing', 'other', '8', 'seasons', 'form', 'individually', 'other', 'box', 'sets', 'see', 'Season', '5', 'available', 'streaming', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'where', 'Sipowicz', 'up', 'still', 'satisfyingly', 'rude', 'not', 'complete', 'nihilist', 'anymore', 'Which', 'proven', 'when', 'last', 'boss', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'brass', 'successor', 'command', 'squad', 'outfit', 'Canada', 'complete', 'series', 'caveat', 'emptor', 'bought', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'first', 'two', 'ABC', 'seasons', 'here', '12-disc', 'set', 'defective', 'discs', 'have', 'nasty', 'habit', 'cramming', '5', '6', 'episodes', 'disc', ""n't"", 'work', 'use', 'dual-layer', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', ""'re"", 'still', 'sitting', 'last', '8', 'seasons', 'official', 'version', 'series']",NYPD Blue - Seasons 1-4
