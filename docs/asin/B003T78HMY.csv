Danny Aiello always turns in a nice performance and ""Stiffs"" is no exception.

This movie with the theme of a divorced dad, former businessman, now hearse driver seemed like it would have some potential but it was really lacking.  All of the elderly Italians of this particular New Jersey neighborhood have died off and business at the funeral home is falling off.  However, there is a plan that involves getting rid of some people that the partners don't really like, but who's to know?  This is where the film gets confusing for me because there is a history of the gambler, addict, friend who is trying to find out about his father.  Then there is Aiello's character who is trying to have a relationship with his son.  It's never clear to me who all the bad guys are and how they all know each other, but there's some major offing going on and it's not a pretty sight!  Too many wakes, wailing, and whacking for me!",2,Stiffed By Stiffs!,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,952,"['Normally', 'love', 'movies', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'such', 'talented', 'actor', 'comedies', 'as', 'well', 'dramas', 'movie', 'theme', 'divorced', 'dad', 'former', 'businessman', 'now', 'driver', 'seemed', 'would', 'have', 'potential', 'was', 'really', 'lacking', 'elderly', 'Italians', 'particular', 'New', 'Jersey', 'neighborhood', 'have', 'died', 'off', 'business', 'funeral', 'home', 'falling', 'off', 'However', 'plan', 'getting', 'rid', 'people', 'partners', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'who', 'know', 'where', 'film', 'confusing', 'history', 'gambler', 'addict', 'friend', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'father', 'Then', 'Aiello', 'character', 'who', 'trying', 'have', 'relationship', 'son', 'never', 'clear', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'how', 'know', 'other', 'major', 'offing', 'going', 'not', 'pretty', 'sight', 'Too', 'many', 'wakes', 'wailing', 'whacking']",Stiffs
