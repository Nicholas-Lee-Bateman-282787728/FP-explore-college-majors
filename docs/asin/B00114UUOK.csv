1129725,AM9YB0BKXFH7Z,B00114UUOK,"B. Ackley ""jumpstudios""","[7, 9]","Makoto Shinkai's film ""5 centimeters per second"" is one of the most moving and satisfying anime films of recent memory. The themes of love, loss and the emotional and physical distances between people have been explored before in his two previous works ""Voices of a distant star"" and ""the place promised in our early years"" however this new film strips away all the sci-fi elements and presents a raw and moving slice-of-life tale.Presented as 3 short films examining the same relationship over time I think that anyone that saw this film would be moved by one if not all the  characters in the story. Whether it be the urgency Takaki feels when he goes to visit Akari,the sadness Akari feels as she is separated from her love or the quiet rejection Kanea feels when she realizes that her feelings for Akari are not the same, everyone can relate to some feeling.Shinkai's trademark visuals of course present and as usual they are lush, cinematic and always beautiful. His ability to take everyday places like trainstops, convenience stores and wide grassy fields and imbue them with a realistic yet dreamlike quality is amazing.5 centimeters is an excellent film and worthy of being seen by a larger audience including viewers who may not watch anime.

1129727,A104FMOV5TRSSY,B00114UUOK,Blue Wand,"[4, 4]","This is a beautiful story. Strangely enough, the first time I watched it I must admit I felt a tad disappointed. I found the tale a bit depressing and slow, and surprisingly short. But after several more viewings, 5 Centimeters Per Second really began to grow on me. Now I appreciate this fine anime as one of my favorites.For starters, the animation itself is superb. Shinkai has a sense of realism that I haven't seen anywhere else. He knows how to capture everyday reality and yet somehow still imbue it with a magical quality all his own. Secondly, the story--divided into three parts--is simply a beautiful tale of love that most people will be able to relate to. No matter what your take on the ending, this is a subtle and emotional journey, driven by characters who are believable and for whom we feel empathy. Finally, I must say that the music for the end is perfect to the last note and delivers quite an emotional payoff.So, while I can see how 5 Centimeters may not be everyone's cup of tea, I encourage you to check it out and spend some time getting to know this moving story. Since it's only an hour or so long, it actually invites repeated viewings.

1129731,A3KZUBM6S477EQ,B00114UUOK,"Darius Jackson ""Action Jackson""","[1, 1]","""5 centimeters per Second"" is a very down-to-earth, sad film. While most anime's depict extreme depictions of violence and romance, this movie breaks those barriers and gives the viewer a sobering look at an often ignored reality, which is the inevitably that life moves on, and the only thing constant is change.One of the most refreshing things about this movie is the length - its clocks in at 62 min, just a tad over an hour. While most films tend to drag on and on, this one does not. Its broken down into three 22min chapters, and tells the story about a boy (Takaki) and girl (Akira) moving apart from each other - not by choice - but because of circumstances beyond there control. A friendship which starts in elementary school that is filled with happiness, hope, and security... is slowly torn apart by space and time. How does it all end? Does he eventually re-unite with Akira and they live happily ever after, does love and patience eventually pay off for Takaki, who desperatly believes that someday him and Akira will be together? Watch the movie and find out, after all, its only an hour. An hour well spent.The technical aspects of the film are astonishing.

1129734,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00114UUOK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[15, 15]","Shinkai Makoto has been someone of a hero for me. Back in 2002, when he won the award as ""Most Valuable Newcomer"" at the Tokyo Anime Fair 21 for ""Voices of a Distant Star"", I was blown away by his work for creating a short animated film by himself using only a Power Mac 7600/120 computer and various consumer and professional design and animation software.In 2005, he returned with another award winning film titled ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"" and his third film ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" which hit theaters back in March 2007 was another award winner for ""Best Animated Film"" at the Asian Pacific Film Awards.But what makes this film different from his previous work is simply amazing. The previous films were very good but ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" is just perfect!From the screenplay, the animation, the music - everything in this film is just perfectly done, well-planned and there is no doubt about it, Shinkai Makoto is one of the most brilliant animators in the world. There is something about his way of thinking, his way of animation that people just fall in love with.With this particular film, ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" is a film divided into three parts.The first part titled ""EXTRACT"" features two friends, Toono Takaki and Shinohara Akari, both attend a new school (fourth grade) with each other.  They have the same class and they enjoy the same things.  As they grow older, both are very fond of each other but in many ways, have difficulty expressing their true feelings for each other. During junior high, Akari moved away and transferred to a new school in a town in the Tochigi Prefecture. The two kept in contact ala penpals through letters sent to each other quite often.When Takaki's parents move towards a country area (Kagoshima Prefecture) near the ocean, their distance has increased. Both are still wanting so badly to see each other, wanting to communicate their emotions to each other but still have difficulty in doing so.  One year after Akari has moved away and a week before Takaki moves, they both agree to meet each other in Akari's hometown. What will happen when the two reunite?For those wondering about the title.  From the initial starting scene of part one, the title is derived from Akari telling Takaki that a cherry blossom petal hits the ground in 5 centimeters per second.The second part is titled ""COSMONAUT"". The story continues years later as we learn that Takaki lives in Tanegashima, an island that is used by the National Space Development Agency of Japan for rocket launches. Takaki plans for college and to return to Tokyo but in the meantime, his classmate Kanae has fallen in love with him. In fact, it's more like love at first sight.She very much wants to tell him how she feels about him but as for Takaki, his mind seems to be somewhere else. In fact, he seems to be texting on his cell phone quite a bit? Who is he texting to? And will Kanae reveal her love to him?It's very interesting to watch this second part and to see how Takaki has been since moving to a new area and how one yearns for the past.The third part is titled ""5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND"" and without revealing too much of this final part of the film, the story revolves around Takaki who is now an adult possibly in his late 20's. Working for a company and his life has changed since his teenager days. All I can say is this final segment alone is just one awesomely, beautiful visual piece with the awesome music of Yamazaki Masayoshi's hit song ""One More Time, One More Chance"" and just how everything just fits.The storyline for each three parts is definitely heartwrenching and there are words said by each character that one can just come away watching the film and just realize how touched they were.GRAPHICS:The film is presented in 1:71:1 and is presented in 16:9 anamorphic. For me, what was accomplished via background art, character design and just overall animation was just perfect. The staff traveled to various locations and took thousands of photos and within the year and a half of making this film, you can't help but just be amazed of how much was put into this film.From various scenery, skylines and locations in Tokyo or somewhere in the country, you get not a few but MANY background art variations. The way the sky, the city or town, the hills, the snow, the trees, the vehicles, a building or buildings, indoors, you name it...they take you on one hell of a visual tour that just screams of awesome, beautiful backgrounds.I am just amazed of how realistic the background art was done and even though Shinkai says that he and his team are not trying to reach realistic sceneries but more of a scenery that one has in their memory of, I'm just digging every aspect of it.The character designs are just impressive. From the emotional standpoint of the characters, to breathing patterns, the flow of wind and how it affects the characters, was remarkably done well on this film as well.SOUND:For the Japanese audio, it's presented in 2.0 with English subtitles with encoding at 224kbps while the English dub is in 5.1 and encoded at 448kbps.As for the voice acting, I primarily watched the version with the Japanese audio but also watched it in English. My only problem with the English dub is when the beginning scenes feature a junior high Takaki, he sounds no different from an older Takaki. While in the Japanese version, there is a difference and amazingly, even discussed further about that situation by Shinkai and the voice actors in the bonus features.But it was pretty cool to watch both because in a way, the variety of emotions in Japanese and the English dub, there with each character is different and you can probably watch both versions and come away with something different emotion-wise but both voice acting are well done.The fact that for the Japanese version, what these voice actors were able to accomplish for their first time voice acting and the direction that Shinkai and staff wanted to achieve was impressive and you learn all about the casting selection and his experience on the special feature interview.As for music selection, I was impressed by the music used. When I heard LINDBERG's ""Kimi no Ichiban ni"" in the second episode, I realize that they put the time period at around 1996. I was surprised to hear LINDBERG but even moreso suprise to hear Yamazaki Masayoshi's hit song ""One More Time, One More Chance"" and how it was utilized for this film. Excellent!SPECIAL FEATURES:For the special features, I can't tell you how happy I was to have an in-depth interview with Shinkai Makoto on this DVD. The interview lasts around 36 or so minutes and Shinkai really shows us what was on his mind from the creation, finding locations, the voice acting, the man is quite meticulous in his planning and he knows what he wants and how to work with great people and work together.Also, where the previous films, distance and speed were a focal point.  Although distance is involved, he wanted to show the speed of how things change within time and how he shows the changes in different time periods of the characters is impressive.I actually was surprised to hear about the growth of the staff and how everyone worked at his apartment and how the apartment could not handle electricity-wise of all the computers used for the film. So, he rented another apartment for more of his staff nearby and how they all worked together. It's so amazing!He's also so down to earth that even during the interview, his cat was walking around his office and that's something you just don't see in an interview. That was interesting to see.And to make things even more special is similar to a Robert Rodriguez or even Quentin Tarentino DVD of them helping film fans understand how they shot certain scenes, on this DVD, Shinkai has no problems of showing his thoughts of a creation of an anime and will show you steps of how they accomplished certain scenes and the staff using Adobe Photoshop for the backgrounds and character designs. I was so happy to see them talk about this and I just wish there was so much more.I really enjoyed how they would show the original photo of the scenery and then show the after animated version, especially adding snow and giving a wintery feel. That was cool to see!Shinkai has definitely become a fan favorite because of what he was able to accomplish by himself with ""Voices of a Distant Star"" but his approach to creating an animated film is just so avant garde, unique and fresh that I'm just proud of him and his work and how he plans things out. Especially his mentality and his observance of people, especially on how he selected his voice actors.Also included in the bonus feature is interviews with the Japanese voice cast and the challenges they faced (since for many of them, it was their first voice acting job) and more importantly what scenes touched them and how they reacted to the film after watching it.These are lengthy interviews and was very happy to see this.Last is ""THE MAKING OF 5 CENTIMETERS PER SECOND MONTAGE"" features behind-the-scenes shots of Shinkai and staff but also a few shots used on location for the film.I can't tell you how much I loved this film.  Shinkai achieved perfection with animation, background art, screenplay, voice acting and the music, everything is just amazing!This is not a film that could be live-action but done in animated form and even animated, almost reaching realistic settings through the background art.  Shows the talent of Shinkai and his staff.  Absolutely awesome!There are not many people who have achieved perfection but it's amazing how Shinkai Makoto has evolved from a guy working on his own to winning an award, to getting a second film and working with a staff and now, his third film and a DVD that just showcases his mindset and what he set out to accomplish.This is one DVD that deserves an A+, 5 out of 5 stars and simply a must-buy!

I dabbled this weekend, as I had heard good things about this film and I was not disappointed. The story is very sweet, and heart breaking. Despite the fact that it is animated (and some beautiful scenes manifest themselves), it is as real as it gets. You can feel the two characters' pain, and anguish, which is rarely accomplished in a ""grown up"" animation. The music and animation effectively compliment the story, and this film resembles some of the best romances.

The different stages one goes through in life, the experiences, the emotional attachments, the happiness and the heartache.  I can relate to this show so much its kind of scary.  It really draws some strong parallels to my life.  I think every single person could relate to this film on some level, from the aspect of one of the characters if not all.  I kind of wished for a happier ending, but I guess thats why I feel this show is an accurate portrayal of life.  It doesnt always have a storybook ending.  In general I was left with a feeling of sadness.  The story itself is told exceptionally well and the animation is amazing.  I think it could stand to be a little longer.  The 3rd episode was very short.  I actually had to re-watch the 3rd episode to fully understand what was going on, because it moves fairly quickly, which I'm sure was done purposely.

1129738,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B00114UUOK,"Hope this helps ""help""","[1, 1]","I think such a claim is a tad bit presumptuous, though.  That said, ""5cm Per Seccond"" is a very interesting and still profound film with many layers of depth and meaning.FOR INTERESTED AND CONCERNED FOLKS...First, there isn't much to worry about in this film.  The language is tame and clean.  I don't remember cussing or provocative language.  I don't remember innuendos and there no instances of fan service or related material.  It is pretty clean.MOVING ON...Plot:This film consists of 3 half-hour segments (I think they are referred to as ""stories"").  All three of which are independent yet connected.  The thing about this film, though is it really can't be described as a movie or a series.  Rather, it is best approached as a visual poem.  If poems became films...this is definitely one form it would take.  The theme is ""5cm Per Second""...the idea that, as a cherry blossom petal falls (5cm/second is it's average speed of falling), it makes many different and unexpected connections and path changes.  The same  with life - as we ""fall through time"", we often wind up in different paths than we originally predicted.  He expounds on this through focusing on the lives to 2 people.  An overarching situation exists for both of them, but not really a plot...instead, you see what happens in their lives at 3 different stages (the episodes).  Narratively speaking, it's not strong or existent in the usual sense, but that's not it's point anyways.Visually:It's stunning!  Very Very beautiful, actually.  The cover art is but a mere shadow of the beauty and realism depicted in the film.Extras:There are interviews of Makoto Shinkai (the director) and the Japanese cast.  This is particularly insightful and very interesting.  Adds to the dialogue that the show, itself, started.  Also, there is a ""making of"" montage.  This one I did not find as interesting (I prefer interviews and stuff).ALL IN ALL...This is a film that comes pretty close to being an ""art film"" rather than ""pure entertainment"".  But, though it is very beautiful, it was ultimately forgettable for me.  Still, the strange thing was it kept drawing you back to finish it.  Strange, huh?  Now, it did move my emotions in spots, but in the end I did not feel like I got too much out of it.  Actually, it left me depressed.  Up to this point, Shinkai's films kinda do that to you haha.  But even so, one cannot deny the love, care, and detail put into this film.  The music is beautiful...until the end credits.  And with it's strong emphasis on reality, this could have been performed live without losing anything.  Ultimately, you really need to be in the mood for a poem...you can't passively watch this one bit.  Also, the rating is ""pg"", but the thing is, this will fly above most kids.  The themes are what drive this work, and they are very mature ones, indeed (and very subtle).  Ultimately, I don't regret the purchase and it did give me some things to think about...but it's not a film I would ""hail"" or anything like that.  This is a film that will force sides...some will love it, some not as much.  For me, it just wasn't my taste.",3,Some Critics Have Hailed Him as the Next Miyazaki...,1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,3117,"['think', 'claim', 'tad', 'bit', 'presumptuous', 'though', 'said', '5cm', 'Per', 'Seccond', 'very', 'interesting', 'still', 'profound', 'film', 'many', 'layers', 'depth', 'meaning.FOR', 'INTERESTED', 'AND', 'CONCERNED', 'FOLKS', 'First', ""n't"", 'much', 'worry', 'about', 'film', 'language', 'tame', 'clean', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'cussing', 'provocative', 'language', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'innuendos', 'instances', 'fan', 'service', 'related', 'material', 'pretty', 'clean.MOVING', 'ON', 'Plot', 'film', '3', 'half-hour', 'segments', 'think', 'are', 'referred', 'stories', 'three', 'are', 'independent', 'yet', 'connected', 'thing', 'film', 'though', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'described', 'movie', 'series', 'Rather', 'best', 'approached', 'visual', 'poem', 'poems', 'became', 'films', 'definitely', 'one', 'form', 'would', 'take', 'theme', '5cm', 'Per', 'Second', 'idea', 'that', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'petal', '5cm/second', 'average', 'speed', 'falling', 'many', 'different', 'unexpected', 'connections', 'path', 'changes', 'same', 'life', 'fall', 'time', 'often', 'wind', 'up', 'different', 'paths', 'originally', 'predicted', 'focusing', 'lives', '2', 'people', 'overarching', 'situation', 'exists', 'not', 'really', 'plot', 'instead', 'see', 'what', 'lives', '3', 'different', 'stages', 'episodes', 'Narratively', 'speaking', 'not', 'strong', 'existent', 'usual', 'sense', 'not', 'point', 'anyways.Visually', 'stunning', 'Very', 'Very', 'beautiful', 'actually', 'cover', 'art', 'mere', 'shadow', 'beauty', 'realism', 'depicted', 'film.Extras', 'are', 'interviews', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'director', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'particularly', 'insightful', 'very', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'show', 'started', 'Also', 'making', 'montage', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'interesting', 'prefer', 'interviews', 'stuff', '.ALL', 'IN', 'ALL', 'film', 'pretty', 'close', 'being', 'art', 'film', 'rather', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'very', 'beautiful', 'was', 'ultimately', 'forgettable', 'Still', 'strange', 'thing', 'was', 'kept', 'drawing', 'back', 'finish', 'Strange', 'huh', 'Now', 'did', 'move', 'emotions', 'spots', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'got', 'too', 'much', 'Actually', 'left', 'depressed', 'point', 'Shinkai', 'films', 'kinda', 'do', 'haha', 'even', 'so', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'love', 'care', 'detail', 'put', 'film', 'music', 'beautiful', 'end', 'credits', 'strong', 'emphasis', 'reality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'performed', 'live', 'losing', 'anything', 'Ultimately', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'mood', 'poem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'passively', 'watch', 'one', 'bit', 'Also', 'rating', 'pg', 'thing', 'will', 'fly', 'most', 'kids', 'themes', 'are', 'what', 'drive', 'work', 'are', 'very', 'mature', 'ones', 'indeed', 'very', 'subtle', 'Ultimately', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'purchase', 'did', 'give', 'things', 'think', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'hail', 'anything', 'film', 'will', 'force', 'sides', 'will', 'love', 'not', 'much', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'taste']",N/A

Tons of movies have been filmed, and books have been written, about the intensity of childhood friendships.  But the sad reality is that the majority of us slowly drift apart from most of the people who meant so much to us in school after graduation - and, more specifically, don't usually end up marrying the first people we fall in love with.  This trilogy of shorts is a study about how we handle that life transition.The main character is Takaki, a nice young boy, but a little quieter and less rambunctious than most.  The fact that he suffers from allergies clinches his preference for taking lunchtime in the library instead of the schoolyard.  There he meets fellow allergy sufferer Akari, of like mind, and the two quickly become inseparable, at first best friends but eventually falling in love.Bad news is on the horizon, however, as Akari tearfully calls Takaki to tell him that her dad's job requires a move, and they spend some last, final time together.  At first they keep in touch, but eventually the text messages dry up, then the calls and finally even letters.  After one final, desperate visit, it's painfully obvious that they're no longer what they used to be to eachother - and they probably won't ever see eachother again.That they were too young for their relationship to withstand Akari's move and not seeing eachother regularly - something that can topple even adult relationships - comes as no surprise.  The question is, rather, whether Takaki will move on before he misses his next chance at love pining away for an experience that by definition he can never have again and is now water under the bridge.With an ending that allows us to draw our own conclusion, and some of the most stunning animation I've ever seen in an anime, I would highly recommend this to anyone who's ever revisited their high school yearbook and wistfully wondered ""where are they now?""",5,A wonderful slice of life anime,1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,1974,"[""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'together', 'graduates', 'end', 'musical', 'Grease', 'Tons', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'intensity', 'childhood', 'friendships', 'sad', 'reality', 'majority', 'slowly', 'drift', 'apart', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'school', 'graduation', 'more', 'specifically', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'marrying', 'first', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'trilogy', 'shorts', 'study', 'how', 'handle', 'life', 'transition.The', 'main', 'character', 'Takaki', 'nice', 'young', 'boy', 'little', 'quieter', 'less', 'rambunctious', 'most', 'fact', 'allergies', 'clinches', 'preference', 'taking', 'lunchtime', 'library', 'instead', 'schoolyard', 'fellow', 'allergy', 'sufferer', 'Akari', 'mind', 'two', 'quickly', 'become', 'inseparable', 'first', 'best', 'friends', 'eventually', 'falling', 'love.Bad', 'news', 'horizon', 'however', 'Akari', 'tearfully', 'Takaki', 'tell', 'dad', 'job', 'move', 'spend', 'last', 'final', 'time', 'together', 'first', 'keep', 'touch', 'eventually', 'text', 'messages', 'dry', 'up', 'then', 'calls', 'finally', 'even', 'letters', 'one', 'final', 'desperate', 'visit', 'painfully', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'longer', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'see', 'eachother', 'were', 'too', 'young', 'relationship', 'withstand', 'Akari', 'move', 'not', 'seeing', 'eachother', 'regularly', 'something', 'can', 'topple', 'even', 'adult', 'relationships', 'surprise', 'question', 'rather', 'Takaki', 'will', 'move', 'next', 'chance', 'love', 'pining', 'away', 'experience', 'definition', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'again', 'now', 'water', 'bridge.With', 'ending', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusion', 'most', 'stunning', 'animation', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anime', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'revisited', 'high', 'school', 'yearbook', 'wistfully', 'wondered', 'where', 'are', 'now']",N/A

The art is incredibly done even the smallest details are almost perfect, and the soundtrack is beautiful. The story is very touching. There were several moments during the movie that made my heart pinch. By the time the credits began my face ached and I wanted to cry.It is a compilation of 3 short stories totaling about an hour.

The film's most pleasing aspect, in my opinion, is the internal dialogue of the male character, Takaki, which was often rendered in highly poetic language (or at least my copy's translation was).  Animes often attempt poetic or philosophical dialogue and only end up sounding pretentious, or willfully obfuscatory.  These lines were beautiful, though, and crystal clear.  Probably one of the best films I've seen about growing apart, and definitely the most realistic.  Highlights include the extended train ride in Chapter 1, which is heartbreaking, and all of Chapter 2 (Cosmonaut).  The only aspect I didn't approve of was the long ending song, which I felt could have been instrumental or perhaps simply a cut to a black screen.

1129745,A2QUH3ZWQ4UDHX,B00114UUOK,Roberto Pang,"[1, 1]","It is indeed a very interesting movie, in the sense that although one might not like the ending, one still feels emotions stirred. Maybe it is sadness or maybe it is the over all sensation of being in love, whatever it is, the movie is effective in prompting it. I really liked this movie but must also say that Ocean Waves left me with a more optimistic and happy feeling.I guess the reason why some people (I am) are deeply touch by this movie might be because they identify at some level with the feeling of ""silent love"" or unreciprocated love. However, I also think that Takaki as a young man might not be the ideal guy who deserves a fulfilling love life. It is fine to be an outsider or bohemian while in middle and high school, but as he was growing up and developing as a grown up, how come he was not able to develop significant friendships? Why didn't we see in the collage the happy parts of his life where he is indeed a well adapted young man with rowdy friends and healthy relationships with other females? Do we have to imagine he went through 10 years of constantly not being happy?Maybe this movie indeed show us the difference between (some) boys and (most) girls, the way boys will always hold dear their first love and have it in high significance while girls will move along and enjoy fully the love that is offered by other suitors at different stages in life.How appealing would an adult Akari find an unhappy and unsmiling adult Takaki? How compatible would have they been had they found each other? Was Takaki still 13 years old, emotionaly?I would have enjoyed a ""typical ending"" of having them found each other and living happily ever after, but I also appreciate the emotions stirred by the real ending (can't always win). However, I would have enjoyed more a clearer signal that Takaki FINALLY puts it together and is able to be the happy, friendly young man that he should be. The smile Takaki cracks at the very end gives me hope, but I wished I could be sure.

Common objects like chairs and cartons of chocolate milk seem to have some importance and element of poetry that contribute to these visual stanzas. The cramped horizontal camera frame is somehow opened up to make room for the broad and colorful scenery presented in this movie. You could press mute and still be engaged by the amazing artistry here.In fact, I wish I had pressed the mute button...The melodramatic and love soaked narration is so dripping with sappiness that this might have been better if it were a silent film. The writing tries way too hard at poetry and poignancy, and so you get heavy handed adjectives and words like ""shimmering"" and ""eternity"" popping up every chance they can get. The body language of the characters said more about love and loss than the story's laborious exposition. Especially story one, ""Cherry Blossoms."" Silence would have been the ideal frame for Takaki's lonely anxiety as he tries to connect with his distant friend. Instead we get diary diatribes distracting from the otherwise delicate imagery. This would have easily been a five star masterpiece had the narration been nixed. There are many clever shots that echo each other, and their brilliance is in their subtlety. Yet the same subtlety is thrown out the window when it comes time for the narratives.

1129747,AQRDUSJ2OJRMG,B00114UUOK,suburban dissident,"[16, 17]","Makoto Shinkai's third film is a tour de force that shows off his growing mastery of beautiful scenery, pristinely depicted emotions, and heart wrenching story telling. 5 Centimeters plays off the ephemeral nature of beauty and joy - the speed at which a cherry blossom petal falls - to say profound things about the nature of love, human relationships, and the strain that the passage of time and the demands of modern life create. I was utterly caught up in the beauty and tragedy of the story and count it among one of the very best anime i have ever seen.Shinkai has often been compared to Hayao Miyazaki as master of the anime medium. If referring to skill of presentation and artistry, the comparison is certainly apt. But the stories that Makoto Shinkai tells evoke the aesthetic quality of Yasunari Kawabata's novels - beauty that is at once delicately nuanced but that reaches deep down into the heart of human experience.With this third installment, fans of Skinkai's earlier works (The Place Promised in our Early Days and Voices of a Distant Star) will see similar themes evoked in 5 Centimeters that have been polished by Shinkai's continue progress as an artist.",5,tragically beautiful,1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,1176,"['Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'third', 'film', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'growing', 'mastery', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'pristinely', 'depicted', 'emotions', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'story', 'telling', '5', 'Centimeters', 'plays', 'ephemeral', 'nature', 'beauty', 'joy', 'speed', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'petal', 'say', 'profound', 'things', 'nature', 'love', 'human', 'relationships', 'strain', 'passage', 'time', 'demands', 'modern', 'life', 'create', 'was', 'utterly', 'caught', 'up', 'beauty', 'tragedy', 'story', 'count', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'anime', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Shinkai', 'often', 'been', 'compared', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'master', 'anime', 'medium', 'referring', 'skill', 'presentation', 'artistry', 'comparison', 'certainly', 'apt', 'stories', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'evoke', 'aesthetic', 'quality', 'Yasunari', 'Kawabata', 'novels', 'beauty', 'once', 'delicately', 'nuanced', 'deep', 'down', 'heart', 'human', 'experience.With', 'third', 'installment', 'fans', 'Skinkai', 'earlier', 'works', 'Place', 'Promised', 'Early', 'Days', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'will', 'see', 'similar', 'themes', 'evoked', '5', 'Centimeters', 'have', 'been', 'polished', 'Shinkai', 'continue', 'progress', 'artist']",N/A
1129748,A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6,B00114UUOK,Suzanne,"[11, 11]","*While I normally don't post a review by replying to another one I thought it would be most productive to respond to Jonathan's negative criticisms of this film since most of my praise for it acts as a counterpoint to his critiques.*Wanting Shinkai to be ""the next Miyazaki"" is placing unnecessary preconceptions and restraints on a director who is a unique artist and not like Miyazaki at all. Miyazaki has succeeded because he's made Eastern fairy tales and fantasy palatable to a Western audience to which these things are often foreign. His style lies more in the narrative than in the aesthetics (though he doesn't exactly skimp in that area). Shinkai in terms of style, form, content, aesthetic, focus, etc. is nothing like Miyazaki.As for the so-called ""pacing problem"" I agreed wholly that Promised was badly paced. But Shinkai's problem is that he couldn't decide what to focus on and how to weave the narrative together. There are two solutions to this; you either maintain a tight control over the flow of the narrative and the characters within it, or you sacrifice narrative pacing for aesthetic pacing. That's what he's chosen to do with 5cm. So the claim that 5cm has bad pacing is completely incorrect. Shinkai is not going for narrative pacing here, but aesthetic pacing. This is a classic technique of Asian art. You can see it in classic Asian film such as Ozu, Mizoguchi, Hsiao-hsien, and Ming-liang. Shinkai achieves this through his minimal focus on narrative, ellipses, pillow shots, musical montages, etc.As for the music, I also disagree and think this film is another leap forward for Shinkai. There are several views when it comes to the best application of music for film, but one I like is Kurosawa's view that music and film go best together when both pieces are missing something; when a piece of music is missing something or a scene is missing something. That way putting music and film together 'completes' the other. I agree in Shinkai's previous films the music was more individual, more distinguished. But I think his application of more 'passive' music in 5cm is much better. And I rather liked how the ending theme compliments the film that came before. It might not be as superficially pretty as other music Shinkai has used (I think it's quite beautiful, but tastes will differ), but I think it fits much better in the context of the film.The complaint that this is just a gooey romance rehashed from Promised isn't really fair from someone who's not attempting to conjure up an original and ""surprising"" narrative. If anything, the film is attempting to get to the emotions associated with the story more than presenting the story itself. Or, put another way, the minimal narrative opens a window into a river of complex emotions associated with such a simplistic and common idea as a youthful romance. Yes, this film is just a variation on his last two, but to criticize Shinkai for that is unfair. Yasujiro Ozu, one of the greatest directors ever, often repeated simplistic storylines using the same actors with even the same character names but just in slightly different circumstances. He did this so as to illuminate a different emotion, aesthetic, or theme each time. And by slightly shifting the content around, his oeuvre forms a kind of Cubist art where you get to see the same thing from different angles.Shinkai is doing the same thing by using the same basic idea and slightly manipulating it with each effort to get something different out of it. You can't really do this switching to a completely different story, because then the pattern is broken. You can not like this approach and claim that it's just the same thing over and over, but to do so is to miss the point badly. Shinkai has finally honed his style enough that he seems to be aware of this. When he began, I thought he would end up going the more Miyazaki route of making sci-fi, fantasy, romances that fit more into a Western mold. But I'm rather glad that he's gone the opposite route and taken his films in a direction that's much closer to classic Eastern art. Because afterall, we have a Miyazaki, why do we need another one? Especially when there aren't enough artists like Shinkai in anime.But even more than his Asian predecessors, Shinkai's films have come to resemble those of the reclusive, enigmatic, American director/poet Terrence Malick. After watching 5cm I was actually reminded vividly of Malick's Days of Heaven, which also features a minimalistic narrative that's used as simply a means for momentum on which the breathtaking visual aesthetics take over. This results in film that's the visual equivalent of poetry, and 5cm does indeed play more like a visual tone poem than a narrative driven film.With 5cm I humbly think that Shinkai has crafted his most complete film to date. A stunningly gorgeous film filled with a rich melancholic tone. The kind of film to watch on a rainy day in a relaxed mood. It's a quiet and graceful film, a humble chamber piece set to a minor key; the anime equivalent of a Schubert Lieder. The 4 star rating is only because as much as I like 5cm, I still think Shinkai is capable of even better.",4,A Reply to Mr. Jonathan Lane's Review,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,5167,"['*While',

1129749,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B00114UUOK,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[5, 5]","5 Centimeters Per Second is a 2007 anime by director Makoto Shinkai.  It tells the story, mainly, of Takaki and his path from a relationship in his early teens to the new one present day.  Spanning three short episodes, Shinkai masterfully weaves this content into a remarkable piece of work.  I just wish it had ended differently.From the start, the art in this film was staggering - I fell in love instantly.  The colors are vibrant and the environments are stunningly accurate.  My wife is from Japan and she was marveling at how precise the designs actually were, especially the train stations.  I've spent some time in Tokyo myself and felt the same.  Visually, this movie is as great as I've seen and the time flew by because of it.  I was left wanting more.5 Centimeters is also written well.  There's some poetry in what's being presented here and some of it is heartbreaking.  I picked up the movie without doing any research and was gifted with a script plotted surprisingly well.  Most of us have been fortunate to experience young love and nearly all of us have at least had the sort of crush depicted here.  The innocence of that took me back and I felt so warmly towards the first two episodes of the film because of it.My only problem here, and it felt like a big one, was the way the film ended.  And I don't mean the storyline or art, these things are covered, but it was so abrupt and capitalized with what felt to me like too tacky and aggressive of a song.  I'm probably irking someone with this part but to break it down simply: I was lulled by this movie for nearly its entirety and had the rug pulled out from under me at the last minute.  The contrast was just too stark for me.  There was a soft, rolling group of emotions I was pulled over by the director and it felt good.  The movement was slow and sometimes sad but introspective and most certainly something to soak up.  Is this making sense?  I was addicted to the pace and the end felt rushed.  (I found out from my wife at the end of the film that the song was extremely popular in Japan at the time.  It's a reasonable explanation but still disappointing - the music chosen for the rest of the movie was perfect.  They didn't need a pop track.)I guess part of the reason I moved from mainstream American cinema to independent and foreign films is because I'm tired of this sort of thing exactly.  It makes me overly sensitive, I'm sure.Still, I will be watching for work out of Makoto Shinkai.  I'm reading things here and there where people have labeled him, ""the new Miyazaki"" but I'm not sure that's accurate.  Miyazaki is a whimsical fantasy writer and illustrator with an intimidating and unbelievably unique imagination.  Shinkai, though?  Judging from what I saw in this film, I'd guess that the man knows hurt and has figured out how to present it with real beauty.  THAT is exciting.Sans the belching crescendo, I admire everything about this film and recommend adding it to your library.Thank you for your time.- t",4,I got stung in the end.,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,3008,"['5', 'Centimeters', 'Per', 'Second', '2007', 'anime', 'director', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'story', 'mainly', 'Takaki', 'path', 'relationship', 'early', 'teens', 'new', 'one', 'present', 'day', 'Spanning', 'three', 'short', 'episodes', 'Shinkai', 'masterfully', 'content', 'remarkable', 'piece', 'work', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'ended', 'differently.From', 'start', 'art', 'film', 'was', 'staggering', 'fell', 'love', 'instantly', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'environments', 'are', 'stunningly', 'accurate', 'wife', 'Japan', 'was', 'marveling', 'how', 'precise', 'designs', 'actually', 'were', 'especially', 'train', 'stations', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'time', 'Tokyo', 'felt', 'same', 'Visually', 'movie', 'as', 'great', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'flew', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more.5', 'Centimeters', 'also', 'written', 'well', 'poetry', 'what', 'being', 'presented', 'here', 'heartbreaking', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'doing', 'research', 'was', 'gifted', 'script', 'plotted', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'Most', 'have', 'been', 'fortunate', 'experience', 'young', 'love', 'nearly', 'have', 'least', 'had', 'sort', 'crush', 'depicted', 'here', 'innocence', 'took', 'back', 'felt', 'so', 'warmly', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'film', 'it.My', 'only', 'problem', 'here', 'felt', 'big', 'one', 'was', 'way', 'film', 'ended', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'storyline', 'art', 'things', 'are', 'covered', 'was', 'so', 'abrupt', 'capitalized', 'what', 'felt', 'too', 'tacky', 'aggressive', 'song', ""'m"", 'probably', 'irking', 'someone', 'part', 'break', 'down', 'simply', 'was', 'lulled', 'movie', 'nearly', 'entirety', 'had', 'rug', 'pulled', 'out', 'last', 'minute', 'contrast', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'stark', 'was', 'soft', 'rolling', 'group', 'emotions', 'was', 'pulled', 'over', 'director', 'felt', 'good', 'movement', 'was', 'slow', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'introspective', 'most', 'certainly', 'something', 'soak', 'up', 'making', 'sense', 'was', 'addicted', 'pace', 'end', 'felt', 'rushed', 'found', 'out', 'wife', 'end', 'film', 'song', 'was', 'extremely', 'popular', 'Japan', 'time', 'reasonable', 'explanation', 'still', 'disappointing', 'music', 'chosen', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'pop', 'track', 'guess', 'part', 'reason', 'moved', 'mainstream', 'American', 'cinema', 'independent', 'foreign', 'films', ""'m"", 'tired', 'sort', 'thing', 'exactly', 'overly', 'sensitive', ""'m"", 'sure.Still', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'work', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', ""'m"", 'reading', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'labeled', 'new', 'Miyazaki', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'accurate', 'Miyazaki', 'whimsical', 'fantasy', 'writer', 'illustrator', 'intimidating', 'unbelievably', 'unique', 'imagination', 'Shinkai', 'Judging', 'what', 'saw', 'film', ""'d"", 'guess', 'man', 'hurt', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'present', 'real', 'beauty', 'belching', 'crescendo', 'admire', 'everything', 'film', 'recommend', 'adding', 'library.Thank', 'time.-', 't']",N/A

Stunning visual and powerful story which many of us can relate to.  To categorize this type of work as ""animation"" seems a bit misleading.  Amazing piece of work.To view with subtitles only with original Japanese voice-over, you have to select both Japanese and English subtitles options under Language setting.  I don't much care for dubbing, but that's also available.  Extra features are nice, but not really needed since this animation can pretty much stand on its own.  It's better to let the viewers interpret on their own rather than having the cast members and directors drag on about their interpretation and intent behind the characters and themes (1 hour combined time to dissect this by the participants), but again, fan of this movie/animation may appreciate this nonetheless.

1129751,AOHQAJRWKEDY6,B00114UUOK,"Ukegirl ""Jill, OldTime Film Fan""","[4, 4]","5 Centimeters Per Second is another lovely anime movie, only about 1 hour long, created by M. Shinkai and his company. It follows the love story of 2 children who grow attached because they both have allergies and feel different from the other kids in school, but they are separated in later grade school when the girl's parents move. For years they keep in touch by letters. As a young teen the boy rides the train to see his love in person in her hometown, and they spend a platonic night together. However, once the girl becomes an adult she falls in love with another person, leaving the young man listless and unsettled in the big city. There is a middle segment in the movie about another girl who falls in love with the boy, but he doesn't really seem to see her as a person, just someone to hang out with. Always his mind keeps drifting back to his old love and he clings to that relationship in his memory.So in one hour you will be subjected to a lot of heartache and angst, but also you will enjoy great beauty and exquisite music in this film.It's a crying shame ADV lost their license to carry this film in the States, so soon after it obtained it and put the film out on a very nice quality DVD. Now the DVD is almost impossible to find unless you have 100 dollars laying around for an OOP one. Be careful of rip offs and bootlegs with this title. Make sure the DVD you get is the ADV version, used. I did hear news about Shinkai wanting a redub of this film in English, which may have something to do with the fact the ADV license was pulled. Very frustrating, because the English dub is quite well done. I liked the voices very much. You can choose Japanese language too if you want, with English subs, but the English dub was just fine too.I obtained my copy on Netflix, which is still making it available as of this date.

1129754,A2CYMGGXS5QPJT,B00114UUOK,Yay for Music!,"[1, 2]","CAUTION: REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!!When I say that the art rivals that of Miyazaki, I mean it. The detail and attention to expressions and the clothes, the backgrounds, every little object has detail that jumps out and further presses the film's theme of isolation.Before I say what is good about this film. I have to note that the first Act is pretty cheesy in its dialogue (and maybe that's just the way it's translated). I, as an avid Anime watcher, always watch my films in the original language with subtitles and sometimes if I've seen the film enough, without them. The Japanese version is better because the characters are done as they were first intended. But the acting is incredible as well as believable.Each moment passes slowly and then speeds past the characters, much like the Cherry Blossoms that fall.This film is about the pain of never being able to get to the person you care about the most and being able to tell them how you feel. Even though you say it, sometimes the time you spend apart makes you isolated and confused.The story comes in three Acts (or sections) the first is about Tono Takaki, a young boy (at the start of the film) who takes an interest in another girl, Araki, who is lonely and awkward like he is. After jumping in to drag her away from students who are writing insults about her on the chalk board, he is helplessly drawn to the idea that they are both connected in their fascination with falling Cherry Blossoms. But because both of their families continually move and they have to keep transferring far away- their attachment becomes strained in an almost strange obsession with an idea of a paradise where they'd stay in the same place forever. But time passes like the falling cherry blossoms and soon they move through each moment in life, becoming more distant.The Second Act is about Takaki at his new school (as a high school student) and a girl who falls for him because he's a nice guy on the surface and doesn't seem to care how strange and indecisive she is. But, even when she finally comes up with the courage and volition to confess, she notices that Takaki was always staring off into the distance whenever he was with her. That he was the furthest thing from being connected to the people around him. An amazing short section that breaks the heart in its honest message.The Third Act is Takaki as a young adult (in his twenties approximately) and how he's inexplicably distant and unhappy with his current job and life. He struggles to understand why he can't keep in contact with Araki the way he used to and why he didn't turn around and see her across the train track (this is a specific scene in the movie- watch to see what I'm talking about) as soon as the train passed quickly. The moment they realize they may be able to connected, one of them is gone.Perhaps the confusing part of the film is the end montage of Takaki and Araki's life. It's hard to understand what is going on. But in essence it is about how both of them have moved on and never really reconnected because their lives dragged them apart. The growing up that happens in the montage-divides the line between an ideal of Takaki's and reality.This strange trio of anecdotes in Takaki and Araki's lives expresses a number emotions and harsh acceptances when people grow up: That some people will accept that they didn't get what they wanted and others will hang on to the sparse moments of joy that they got falling from the sky even if it's only for five seconds.A real winner for all Miyazaki fans!",5,Certainly One of the Best Films whose Art Rivals Miyazaki's,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,3542,"['CAUTION', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SOME', 'SPOILERS', 'When', 'say', 'art', 'Miyazaki', 'mean', 'detail', 'attention', 'expressions', 'clothes', 'backgrounds', 'little', 'object', 'detail', 'out', 'further', 'presses', 'film', 'theme', 'isolation.Before', 'say', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'have', 'note', 'first', 'Act', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'maybe', 'just', 'way', 'translated', 'avid', 'Anime', 'watcher', 'always', 'watch', 'films', 'original', 'language', 'subtitles', 'sometimes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'enough', 'Japanese', 'version', 'better', 'characters', 'are', 'done', 'were', 'first', 'intended', 'acting', 'incredible', 'as', 'well', 'believable.Each', 'moment', 'slowly', 'then', 'speeds', 'characters', 'much', 'Cherry', 'Blossoms', 'fall.This', 'film', 'pain', 'never', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'person', 'care', 'most', 'being', 'able', 'tell', 'how', 'feel', 'Even', 'say', 'sometimes', 'time', 'spend', 'apart', 'isolated', 'confused.The', 'story', 'three', 'Acts', 'sections', 'first', 'Tono', 'Takaki', 'young', 'boy', 'start', 'film', 'who', 'interest', 'girl', 'Araki', 'who', 'lonely', 'awkward', 'jumping', 'drag', 'away', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'writing', 'insults', 'chalk', 'board', 'helplessly', 'drawn', 'idea', 'are', 'connected', 'fascination', 'falling', 'Cherry', 'Blossoms', 'families', 'continually', 'move', 'have', 'keep', 'transferring', 'far', 'away-', 'attachment', 'becomes', 'strained', 'almost', 'strange', 'obsession', 'idea', 'paradise', 'where', ""'d"", 'stay', 'same', 'place', 'forever', 'time', 'passes', 'falling', 'cherry', 'blossoms', 'soon', 'move', 'moment', 'life', 'becoming', 'more', 'distant.The', 'Second', 'Act', 'Takaki', 'new', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'girl', 'who', 'nice', 'guy', 'surface', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'how', 'strange', 'indecisive', 'even', 'when', 'finally', 'up', 'courage', 'volition', 'confess', 'Takaki', 'was', 'always', 'staring', 'off', 'distance', 'whenever', 'was', 'was', 'furthest', 'thing', 'being', 'connected', 'people', 'amazing', 'short', 'section', 'heart', 'honest', 'message.The', 'Third', 'Act', 'Takaki', 'young', 'adult', 'twenties', 'approximately', 'how', 'inexplicably', 'distant', 'unhappy', 'current', 'job', 'life', 'understand', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'contact', 'Araki', 'way', 'used', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'around', 'see', 'train', 'track', 'specific', 'scene', 'movie-', 'watch', 'see', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'about', 'as', 'soon', 'train', 'passed', 'quickly', 'moment', 'realize', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'connected', 'one', 'gone.Perhaps', 'confusing', 'part', 'film', 'end', 'montage', 'Takaki', 'Araki', 'life', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'essence', 'how', 'have', 'moved', 'never', 'really', 'reconnected', 'lives', 'dragged', 'apart', 'growing', 'up', 'montage-divides', 'line', 'ideal', 'Takaki', 'reality.This', 'strange', 'trio', 'anecdotes', 'Takaki', 'Araki', 'lives', 'number', 'emotions', 'harsh', 'acceptances', 'when', 'people', 'grow', 'up', 'people', 'will', 'accept', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'wanted', 'others', 'will', 'hang', 'sparse', 'moments', 'joy', 'got', 'falling', 'sky', 'even', 'only', 'five', 'seconds.A', 'real', 'winner', 'Miyazaki', 'fans']",N/A
