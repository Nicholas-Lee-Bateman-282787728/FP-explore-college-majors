1447787,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00595W3F6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","I think that it's a safe bet that anyone who might be picking up Bette Midler's ""The Showgirl Must Go On"" is most likely already a fan of the Divine Miss M. So what can I tell you? Showgirl is a production that ran for approximately two years at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas between 2008 and early 2010. Taped for HBO, this is the fifth special that Midler has provided for the network in her illustrious career (the first was in 1977!). Unfortunately, the HBO airing and the subsequent DVD release does not showcase the entire Vegas production. Midler's average show clocked in at about 90 minutes and the DVD release (as well as the televised HBO production) comes in at 67 minutes. Most of Midler's biggest and most expected numbers are intact with a song list that includes the following noteworthy numbers:Big Noise from Winnetka, The Showgirl Must Go On, Friends, The Rose, Do You Wanna Dance, From a Distance, Boolya JaDa, Hello in There, Pretty Legs/Hot in Here, Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, Wind Beneath My WingsIf you saw the show live, perhaps the most noticeable omission is the uproarious disco parody. However, wishing doesn't make things different and won't add the content back into the concert. As the creative force and producer behind the show, I'm sure Midler had a hand in the final decision making process (I suspect it came down to financial matters as it usually does, especially concerning various non-Midler covers). But if you love Midler, you'll have to decide if the 70 minute version is enough to keep you entertained. And, for most, I'm guessing the answer will be ""yes.""Midler provides everything you might expect in this presentation. More mature, and more prone to breathlessness, she can still light up a stage. Here she is ably backed by a troupe of dancers called the Caesar Salad Girls (the costuming is inspired), a 13 piece band, and a back up singing group named The Harlettes. It's bawdy, brassy and quite colorful (as are all her shows) and ripe with double entendres without being overtly inappropriate to more sensitive viewers. But I will say that with Midler--what you expect is what is delivered. If you are familiar with her stage performances, nothing here is particularly revelatory. It's just a grand dame doing what she does best. An easy recommendation if you're a fan.

I've listened to Bette's recordings for decades, but have never seen her live.  This DVD opens with a wild tornado that lands us in a whirlwind of dancing girls, bright colors, music and Bette.  Most powerful for me was her performance of ""From A Distance,"" one of the serious songs tucked within the show.  Looking great in an orange flowing gown, Bette reaches her hands up almost as if she had a direct line to the Almighty.  Also amazing was her powerful performance of John Prine's ""Hello In There.""  Now in her 60s, Bette seemed to have great empathy for old people who ""grow lonesome.""  Toni Basil, who's one hit ""Mickey"" came in the early 80s, does the choreography.
