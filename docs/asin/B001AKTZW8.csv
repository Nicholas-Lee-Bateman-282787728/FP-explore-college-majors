1166232,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B001AKTZW8,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 6]","Men sometimes have difficulty growing up.  This is a premise that many women--even some men-- are embracing nowadays.  It's an unfortunate fact but true.  In various ways, women can be turned off, alienated, and hurt by what one author penned in his book title, 'The Peter Pan Syndrome: Men Who Have Never Grown Up'.  Relationships and commitments are delayed, gratification becomes fleeting, but is often a foundational fact in men's lives.Of course it isn't always true, and women and men often seek and find maturity from within and from others.  Yet, you can't help be taken by how true 'Made of Honor' grasps at this concept.Tom (Patrick Dempsey) is a serial ladies' man.  He has looks and charisma, but his appetite is admittedly for ""insatiable sports' sex"".  During college, he meets Hannah (Michelle Monaghan), who knows better than her counterparts that no one is going to use her casually and put her aside.  Unlike her roommate, she holds out for what she wants.  And what she gets is a relationship or at least a friendship with Tom.Ten years later Hannah and Tom are still together.  Tom is seemingly satisfied with his conquests.  He must still be desirable, for he has at least one woman in his queue who is willing to follow his ""no more than one date per week"" rule.  Hannah and he are pals.  They go shopping and  out for lunch and cheesecake like no macho men I know, but the casual acting suspends our disbelief.  At this point and throughout the movie, I felt the film drew strong reminiscences from 'My Best Friend's Wedding,' an engaging film with a phony premise, but much of the operating procedure can be found here in a gender role reversal.  Instead of Julia Roberts regretting her ex-lover pal getting engaged, it's Dempsey's turn.How does he cope with it?  Well, ""absence makes the heart fonder"".  This clich&eacute; is actively used in many movies from the intrigue and intricacy of 'Closer (Superbit Edition),' where its sordid and interesting to most conventional movies you can think of.  This time its closer to the latter.  One of the more endearing aspects of `Made of Honor' is Tom's relationship with his father (here played by with warmth in a sunset role by the late Sydney Pollack).  While Tom is a serial lover, Dad is a serial groom.  In one scene together,  he is negotiating a pre-nuptial agreement with his beautiful young bride, the sixth of his life.When Hannah takes a business trip to Scotland, she meets the perfect man.  Even before Tom's shock of meeting him upon her return, he is empty and missing her.  He decides to change his priorities.  Just like in 'My Best Friend's Wedding' where the buddy relationship is pulled into the engagement, it seems a bit contrived and implausible.  Yes, ex-lovers are invited to weddings, but this time her lothario friend is chosen to be her maid of honor, an ignominious title, even the most sensitive male would find too much.It makes for an interesting far-fetched set-up, and if it weren't for Dempsey's naturally casual performance, nearly matched by the supporting male cast, it could have been a disaster.  With his basketball buddies we get the gamut of male talk, but it's Felix (Kadeem Hardison) who suggests he sabotage the nuptials from within.  Now who do you know in the real world of men would say or do that?The mixed blessing here is that the plot makes the deliberations new while it makes us incredulous.  Can you imagine basketball buddies helping Tom make flowery gift baskets for a wedding shower?  And it only speaks well for Dempsey's talent that he can make us believe the cattiness of Hannah's supporting friends who were passed up for a man.  Yet, their private investigation of his rival, Colin (Kevin McKidd), a descendent of a Scottish Duke, works well enough to keep our eyes from rolling out of our heads.In the end 'Made of Honor' is a likable, if not predictable film.  It has as many rewards as it has drawbacks.  It certainly helps that the cast and characters, except Colin's overbearing family, are likable enough and the performances aren't overwrought for some forced proceedings.  I'm particularly partial to Monaghan's sweet reading of Hannah, and I find Dempsey, like Roberts before him, likable enough to empathize with his problems.  I do think despite some of the preposterousness, some people--yes, especially women--will profit from this viewing experience.  In the end I have to confess I hold affection for what I know is basically an average film.

I must agree however with other reviewers that the Scotland scenes were rather visually pleasing. The concept of two best friends a male and a female, has been done before.

That is not a valid criticism anymore as so many of these type of movies have been done. They are all going to tread on parts of another. The question is, is it a good movie, is the acting decent. Does it annoy you? Made of Honor didn't annoy me and was not unreasonably formulaic.Tom, Patrick Dempsey, meets Hanna, Michelle Monaghan, one late night at college when he is drunk. He goes for a hook up with her roommate and gets into bed with Hanna. After much screaming and freaking out, they go down to the lobby and have a wonderful conversation. I think it is obvious that Tom falls for her that night, and she him too... but they both drop hints as to why they don't want to enter a relationship. His reputation ladies man already proceeds him and she isn't his typical loose hot girl - she is a serious art history major. He has an idea for a coffee cup holder (eventually adopted by Starbucks) and clearly they are friends for life after their first meeting.Fast forward 10 years and Tom is wealthy (invented those coffee cup holders) and Hanna works at a museum in New York. They are best friends and Tom is still a ladies man, but every Sunday he and Hanna do stuff. It is obvious they are BFFs. Hanna routinely goes to his dad's (a serial marrier) weddings with him and unlike most romantic comedys - they genuinely enjoy each other. No bickering - I hate you- no I love you - here. It seems they have never been apart for long. At one of the marriage parties, Toms ladies man veneer begins to crack and Hanna comes close to moving them closer, but Tom pulls back. Hanna almost shrugs her shoulders like she hoped but accepts where he is right now.Hanna goes to Scotland for work for six weeks. During this time Tom realizes how much he needs Hanna and how little his other women really mean to him. He has probably been coming to this conclusion for a while, the 6 week thing just pushes him over the edge. But Hanna returns engaged to a pretty decent guy and Hanna asks Tom to be her maid of honor. He accepts hoping he can point out to her that she loves him and he is ready to commit.Ok, that whole maid of honor thing was the ""marketing hook"" that thankfully wasn't brought up that much. And once Hanna gets engaged the movie starts dragging with silly make fun of Scotland scenes. However, those were thankfully brief and Tom's way of letting Hanna in on his change of heart was a little different then most movies. No talking was involved and gave Hanna the opportunity to know that he loved her and think about it - and make the choice. I hate when movies end with...

Tom (Patrick Dempsey) certainly does; he's been best friends with Hannah (Michelle Monaghan) ever since college, but only when another man proposes does Tom finally admit that he loves her. Now all he has to do is win her back. The idea behind ""Made of Honor"" is certainly classic as far as romantic comedies are concerned, which I guess is why the filmmakers stirred things up by making Dempsey's character the Maid of Honor. Then again, ""stirred things up"" might be too strong a term here; this movie is about as predictable and contrived as romantic comedies get, offering absolutely nothing new ... except, of course, for that whole male Maid of Honor thing. That, and a scene in which Hannah's grandmother wears a string of glow-in-the-dark sex beads, thinking it's a regular necklace. You certainly don't see that everyday.The truth is that ""Made of Honor"" is no better and no worse than you expect it to be--you want a romantic comedy, you've got a romantic comedy. But if you want something more, something with greater depth of character and a few less one-liners, I'm afraid you'll have to keep looking. I won't go so far as to say that this movie is bad, but it definitely doesn't want to be anything other than Hollywood fluff with one or two over the top gags. I've repeatedly observed that romantic comedies never represent reality, but merely the illusion of happily ever after, and rest assured that ""Made of Honor"" is no exception to the rule. The problems with this film don't stem from an unrealistic plot filled with unrealistic characters; they stem from how ineffectively these unrealistic elements are used. You watch this film waiting for something new to surprise you, only to leave feeling as if you've been there and done that.Still, there are worse films out there. I did smile more than once at the onscreen chemistry between Dempsey and Monaghan, chemistry so prominent that it seems unlikely their characters would act on their feelings so late in the relationship. Ten years ago, while still in college, Tom and Hannah met while he was dating her roommate. After a Halloween party, he snuck into Hannah's room wearing a Bill Clinton mask, believing her roommate was already there and waiting. Instead, he finds Hannah, who immediately sprays perfume into his eyes because she thinks he's an attacker. After flushing his eyes out in a water fountain, they strike up a conversation; Tom apparently believes that honesty is the best policy, especially for men who sleep around as much as he does. Hannah seems to find him charming, but she boldly asserts that she never sleeps with anyone like him.In present day, Tom is the exact same womanizer he's always been. He's learned from the best; his father (Sidney Pollack) marries for the sixth time within the first thirty minutes of the film. Tom now follows a strict set of rules: never take any one woman on two consecutive dates, and wait at least twenty-four hours before calling someone new, because you'd seem desperate otherwise. How he maintains this lifestyle, I have no idea; what he does for a living is never alluded to, but his spacious Manhattan apartment hints at a decent salary. Be that as it may, he and Hannah--now an art historian--have been the best of friends ever since that fateful Halloween night. When she's called away to Scotland for six weeks, he begins to realize the affect she's had on his life; after all, the two have been virtually inseparable for ten years. Maybe he is in love with her. Maybe there's more to life than just sleeping with women (a concept his basketball buddies don't seem to understand, naturally).Unfortunately, Tom gets the surprise of his life when Hannah returns to New York with her Scottish fianc&eacute;, Colin (Kevin McKidd), who's both a Duke and an owner of his family's whiskey distillery. Since Hannah knows that she would be Tom's Best Man at his wedding, she thinks it's fitting that he be her Maid of Honor. He begrudgingly takes on the role, believing he can somehow make her see that he's the right man, not Colin. As Tom plunges into the blatantly feminine world of wedding coordination and shower planning, he grapples with buried feelings, bad advice, and the wrath of Hannah's resentful cousin, Melissa (Busy Philipps).The last twenty minutes of the story proper takes place in Scotland, where Hannah plans to live after the wedding. Naturally, this is when the romantic feelings between her and Tom finally begin to surface, and this, of course, creates more tension for that climactic moment when Tom rides a horse to the church and flies through the entrance. This is but one of many moments that sound funnier than they actually are. One of the film's most unnecessary side characters is a desperate nerd that tries to play basketball with Tom and his friends: How many times do they have to tell him no before he gets the idea? There's also a moment early on when Hannah is restoring a painting of a nude male; the movements of her head give the impression that she's giving the figure oral sex. The moment in and of itself is amusing, but it certainly doesn't work within the context of the story. But the biggest problem of ""Made of Honor"" is much more basic than a few inappropriate laughs--its formula is overused, a condition Dr. McDreamy can't even treat.",3,My Best Friend's

They genuinely enjoy each other's company. Early on, her character shows a little secret through facial acting. This is more than friendship. The story will obviously lead to an open declaration of love.

When he knows he will lose his best friend, Tom (Dempsey) rethinks his relationship, especially after she asks him to be her maid of honor.The rest of the movie is his quest to attain the lovely Hannah as HIS wife, not as the handsome Scotsman's.

This is romantic comedy so I didn't expect much more than entertainment and the basic romantic comedy plot recipe. And this film delivered those.Stereotypical bad boy Tom (Dempsey) plays the field, with rules like ""no back to back encounters"", and ""once a week only"" with a growing long list of women. Seems like he's slept with nearly all the eligible females in New York. But he has a soft spot for his best friend Hannah, and a standing weekly Sunday date, where he is able to relax the rules and truly enjoy the company of a woman who is ""what you see is what you get.""Hannah leaves the country and Tom fills his Sundays with women who don't measure up to Hannah and he realizes that his feeling for Hannah have grown into something deeper. When she returns with an upcoming whirlwind wedding plan and asks Tom to be her Maid of Honor the plot thickens.Sensitivity warnings: Plenty of raunchy comments pepper the film, a few epitaphs, a couple of awkward scenes, several half-dressed women or women spilling out of tight clothing flit across the screen. The shower entertainment ends up being a ""love"" toy demonstrator. So, be warned.

I am really getting sick and tired of my wife making me watch the same crap over and over again.Some of them actually aren't too bad (Princess Bride, Ever After, Ghost etc etc etc) but some of them really are. Made of Honor is definitely a pass on. While there are a lot of decent things about this movie the bad far outweights the good. There is actually good acting and some laughs.The storyline is very weak and extremly predictable. The storeline is also very unrealistic. No man who is addicted to having sex with a big bosumed blond each night is ever going to be a ""friend"" with an attractive woman. If the man is addicted to sex he's going to have sex with anyone. I find it strange that the main male character (whose name I've forgotten already) hasn't contracted a sexually transmitted disease. I also find it interesting that there are numerous beautiful large breasted women who are ready to go to bed with a 40ish single male slut on the first date. I admit that the majority of America doesn't wait for marriage to partake of sex but I'm sure most women just don't hop into bed with a new guy each night.This movie is not as raunchy as some of the R rated ones out there but it still pretty bad with all it's sex talk and scenes and the movie isn't nearly charming enough to make this movie stand out to be anything more than it is.

The film is pleasant and wellmade up to a point, and I predict it will enjoy a long life on video, thanks to the appeal of the stars.  Dempsey is an acquired taste all right, and I wouldn't cross the street to see him if he was giving away real estate, but a lot of people love him, and fans will get a lot of him here.  Every shot of him is framed and lit in a way to suggest he is the most adorable man on earth, a way of thinking that perplexes the ordinary viewer, though I will give him credit here, he allows himself brief moments of looking like a clown when the script calls for it.  There's the one sequence where, after a rousing basketball game he joins Kevin McKidd in the shower, his eyes straying to where McKidd's soaping himself up, over and over, high road and low road, and Dempsey panics.  In the theater I was in, for the 2:15 show, this bit of male panic made everyone laugh.  However Dempsey doesn't really seem like he's enjoying himself or even particularly invested in the script.Michelle Monaghan works wonders with what she's got, though it's stretching to have her play the second part of the picture as though she's in love with the Scottish hunk, and she's only momentarily forgotten she's been in love with Dempsey since the era of Monica Lewinsky.  It's a familiar storyline but it doesn't make it any easier to swallow.  We just saw this story a few months back in PS I LOVE YOU when Hilary Swank was brought to mysterious Ireland to fall in love all over again, only now here it's Scotland.The one who should get the Oscar next spring is the fellow who made Dempsey look 20 years old for the opening sequences of the picture.  It can't be just makeup, it must be a blend of makeup and CGI, perhaps a stand-in?  It is totally eerie and unworldly--what Freud called the ""uncanny""--and sort of sets the tone for the rest of the film, the underlying attitude that says, he is a monster, but he's a loveable monster and he's ours.",3,It was playing at 2:15 . . .,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,2017,"['was', 'just', 'perfect', 'had', 'few', 'hours', 'kill', 'film', 'pleasant', 'wellmade', 'up', 'point', 'predict', 'will', 'enjoy', 'long', 'life', 'video', 'thanks', 'appeal', 'stars', 'Dempsey', 'acquired', 'taste', 'right', 'would', ""n't"", 'cross', 'street', 'see', 'was', 'giving', 'away', 'real', 'estate', 'lot', 'people', 'love', 'fans', 'will', 'get', 'lot', 'here', 'Every', 'shot', 'framed', 'lit', 'way', 'suggest', 'most', 'adorable', 'man', 'earth', 'way', 'thinking', 'ordinary', 'viewer', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'here', 'brief', 'moments', 'looking', 'clown', 'when', 'script', 'one', 'sequence', 'where', 'rousing', 'basketball', 'game', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'shower', 'eyes', 'straying', 'where', 'McKidd', 'soaping', 'up', 'high', 'road', 'low', 'road', 'Dempsey', 'panics', 'theater', 'was', '2:15', 'show', 'bit', 'male', 'panic', 'made', 'everyone', 'laugh', 'However', 'Dempsey', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'enjoying', 'even', 'particularly', 'invested', 'script.Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'wonders', 'what', 'got', 'stretching', 'have', 'play', 'second', 'part', 'picture', 'love', 'Scottish', 'hunk', 'only', 'momentarily', 'been', 'love', 'Dempsey', 'era', 'Monica', 'Lewinsky', 'familiar', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'make', 'easier', 'swallow', 'just', 'saw', 'story', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'PS', 'LOVE', 'YOU', 'when', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'was', 'brought', 'mysterious', 'Ireland', 'fall', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'only', 'now', 'here', 'Scotland.The', 'one', 'who', 'should', 'get', 'Oscar', 'next', 'spring', 'fellow', 'who', 'made', 'Dempsey', 'look', '20', 'years', 'old', 'opening', 'sequences', 'picture', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'makeup', 'must', 'be', 'blend', 'makeup', 'CGI', 'perhaps', 'stand-in', 'totally', 'eerie', 'unworldly', 'what', 'Freud', 'called', 'uncanny', 'sort', 'sets', 'tone', 'rest', 'film', 'underlying', 'attitude', 'monster', 'loveable', 'monster']",N/A

Sneaking into a room one night, he accidentally meets Hannah (Michelle Monaghan).  Despite their less then great meeting, the two hit if off and become friends.Flash forward 10 years, and little has changed.  Tom spends every night with a different woman.  And he spends all day hanging out with Hannah, who is now working for a museum.  The two are close friends, but that is all.Until one day when Hannah leaves on a six week trip to Scotland.  It doesn't take Tom long to realize that he truly loves Hannah.  In fact, the separation is killing him.  He intends to act on his new found feelings as soon as she gets back.But when Hannah returns, it is with Colin (Kevin McKidd) in tow.  The two met in Scotland and are engaged.  To further add to Tom's misery, Hannah asks him to be her maid of honor.  Tom is reluctant, but decides he can break the wedding apart better from the inside.  But with the ceremony only two weeks again, can Tom make Hannah fall for him?So let's get the obvious out of the way first, the story is predictable.  So, the movie is going to rise of fall based on how well everything else comes off.And it comes off reasonably well.  Hannah is likable from the start.  I admit it took me a little while to warm up to Tom since I'm not a fan of cads.  But as the movie progressed, I found it easy to root for him.  In fact, I cared about the characters enough to get invested in the outcome.And the story is funny.  There are quite a few great moments that had me laughing, especially Tom's friends helping him learn how to be a maid of honor.This movie is just an escapist romantic comedy.

Patrick Dempsey proves that he can handle a very different character to ""McDreamy"" (Doctor Jonathan Shepherd from ""Gray's Anatomy"")and Michelle Monahan is beautiful and charming as the heroine.The film begins with a student party, during which Tom, (Dempsey) a senior year student who has seduced half the female students at the University, meets a girl called Hannah in the most embarrassing circumstances imaginable when he accidentally gets into the wrong bed. Despite this dreadful introduction, they become best friends, in a completely platonic way.The story resumes ten years later, in New York. Although he has remained a serial womaniser who is successful in charming every other girl he takes a fancy to into bed, for relationships which are about sex and nothing else, Tom's friendship with Hannah has become part of the bedrock of both their lives but appears to have remained entirely platonic.The first hint that the relationship between Tom and Hannah might not be quite as platonic as they both think comes when he persuades her to come with him to his father's sixth wedding. Tom Senior, a wealthy man in his sixties, is marrying a beautiful girl of 25 (e.g. about five years younger than his son.) During a series of silly events which I won't describe to avoid spoiling the story, the viewer realises that both friends mean more to each other then they are prepared to admit even to themselves.Then Hannah has to go to Scotland for six weeks on business, and while there she is swept off her feet by Colin (Kevin McKidd), handsome heir to a family of dour highland aristocrats who are even richer than Tom's father. Returning to New York with Colin, Hannah tells Tom that she is getting married to Colin in a fortnight, in Scotland. And as he is her best friend, she wants him to be her ""maid of honour"".This comes just as Tom has finally realised that he is in love with Hannah, and presents him with a dilemma: does he support his best friend in her choice of life partner, or use the position to try to persuade her to marry him instead?Most people will find the shenanigans which follow to be highly amusing.One warning - the film takes the mickey out of every cliche about Scotland from an American perspective in a way which patriotic Scots - and indeed, Scots-Americans and residents of parts of the UK other than Scotland - may find irritating.If you are not too put off by this, and by one or two highly predictable stock Hollywood RomCom chiches, you will probably enjoy ""Made of Honour"" although it might not have much repeat entertainment value.

I take PG-13 to mean that some children around 13 years old may watch it, but may need some parental guidance as to what's going on in some scenes.  So, tell me how I should guide my 13-year old daughter if she asks me:(1)Dad, what does ""bj"" mean?(2)Why was Hannah shaking her head gently in front of the genitals of the male figure in the painting? Is this scene meant to be funny?(3)What is that ""thunder beads"" that woman was selling, and why did the old lady ask, ""Where should I put it?""I indeed watched this DVD with my 15-year old daughter and my wife.  Thankfully, my daughter did not ask me those questions. I do not know whether she in fact knew the answers to those questions, because we just had ""uncomfortable silences"" when watching those scenes.  Having endured some really gross and disgusting R-rated so-called comedies (e.g. Knocked Up, Clerks II), I now avoid them completely.  I thought it should be safer to watch PG-13 comedies with my family.  This movie got me to think twice.  While it is not as bad as those R-rated trash, those crude sex jokes have no place in the romantic comedy genre. It's a sad reflection of the lack of ability of film writers these days to think of any jokes other than sex-related vulgarities.

It's just overdone and beaten into our brains throughout most of the film...pretty much every minute after the man is asked to take on the role.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the film.Tom (Dempsey) and Hannah (Monaghan) met at a Cornell costume bash 10 years before when a drunken Tom, dressed as President Clinton, stumbled into a dorm room and a girl's bed thinking he'd found ""Monica"".  Turned out he'd gotten the wrong girl.  ""Monica"" was Hannah's inebriated roomie.They were friends from that moment, sharing Sundays, confidences, and desserts.  Tom didn't know how much they shared til Hannah headed for Scotland and stayed gone six weeks.  He was ready to propose when she came back, but she returned with a man, Colin (McKidd).Hannah and Colin were going to be wed in Scotland in two weeks and Hannah couldn't think of anyone she wanted to be her Made of Honor more than her longtime best friend.  Tom reluctantly accepted, secretly agreeing to become the best maid of honor and wreck the wedding.What happens had me laughing until tears streamed down my face.  I needed the break and ""Made"" defintely offered it. Tom hosting the wedding shower was a screamer--particularly when the jealous female friend who wanted to be the ""MOH"" set him up with a sex toy salesperson and Hannah's sweet Grandma ended up with a necklace of 'thunderbeads.' Then, of course, there was the Highland Games with Tom and Colin tacitly competing for Hannah's hand, Tom dressed in a mini kilt.  (Nope, he wasn't dressed regimental--darn!)Director Sydney Pollack showed up in a rare movie role as Tom's oft-wed Dad.  The prenup agreement with Wife 5 (or was it 6, Dad can't remember) had me roaring.  The car with the intended bride had to literally go around the block at the church to iron out last-minute details.Plus, the scenery from Scotland was amazing. I recognized some places I'd been a few years before--and definitely remembered the flock of Hieland Coos stopping traffic on mainstreet.The music was good, a mix of contemporary plus some old Scottish tunes.  I notice there's no soundtrack available.  I hope there will be one.  It was a pretty decent collection.The film's what you'd expect and yet, it's still entertaining.

Zwick,"[3, 5]","Tom (Patrick Dempsey) is a commitment-phobic, marriage-avoiding playboy who spends most of his waking hours tomcatting around Manhattan (what a novel concept for a romantic comedy). Only Hannah (Michelle Monaghan), his ""best friend"" of ten years, has the strength of character to call him on his shallowness - even though anyone with even the most rudimentary knowledge of romantic comedy knows full well that the two of them are just made for each other (apparently, the only people in these situations stupid enough not to realize this universal truth are the couples themselves). But just as Tom decides he's in love with Hannah and is willing to make a lifelong commitment to her, the latter turns up engaged to a kilt-wearing dreamboat (""Rome""'s Kevin McKidd) she met in Scotland. Unaware of how Tom feels about her, Hannah asks him to be her ""maid of honor"" at the wedding, a role he reluctantly accepts, believing that this will place him in the perfect strategic position to sabotage the nuptials.As with virtually all romantic comedies these days, ""Made of Honor"" takes place in a squeaky-clean, never-never land version of New York City, where everyone attends swanky functions, dines at five-star restaurants, and drinks caf&eacute; mocha lattes, with nary a hint as to what any of these fantastically well-off characters do to earn all their money. And, of course, almost everyone we meet is white (with a token African-American or two, as always, thrown in for good measure).The late Sydney Pollack plays Tom's oft-married father, whose penchant for running through women at an alarming rate shows that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree in that family. And, of course, Tom is surrounded by the obligatory coterie of jock friends who discuss women, commitment and sex with all the depth and maturity of a bunch of junior-high school students feeling their first stirrings of puberty.

Tom realizes that Hannah, his best friend of long standing, is the right person for him only after she announces her engagement to Colin (Kevin McKidd), a handsome and good-natured Scottish aristocrat (this part reminds us of Hugh Grant and ""Four Wedding and a Funeral"").The film could have used more effectively the unique situation of Tom, who is asked by Hannah to be her ""maid of honor,"" but instead director Paul Weiland (who did a much better job in ""Roseanna's Grave"") relies on jokes and sight gags for comedic effect including a fat lady in her tight dress or an old lady wearing a ""toy"" that glows in the dark. None of them is really funny to me except Patrick Dempsey's plate juggling (he actually does). Tom is put in a situation like Julia Roberts' heroine in ""My Best Friend's Wedding,"" but there is no memorable supporting character like Rupert Everett with his gentle humor.It is hard to dislike ""Made of Honor,"" just as it is hard to dislike Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan in this formulaic romantic comedy.

""Me!""","[0, 3]","I cannot for the life of me understand the person who ""loves"" romantic comedy films.  99.55% of them begin, continue, and end the same way.  This one is no different.  Guy is a bad boy, jerk who sleeps around with every girl he can.  Girl is a goodie two-shoes who insists she would ""never"" be into a guy like that... but of coarse she is.  Her love makes the bad boy into someone who for the first time ever wants to be monogomous.
