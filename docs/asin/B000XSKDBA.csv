I was surprised at how graphic it was, but for him it was a reality check.  I really liked the perspectives from the victim's family members and the drunk driver.  My son teared up as he watched the victim's mother, watching her son die.  We also discussed how the drunk driver made a choice, and how that one decision changed his life forever - with jail, and with living with the fact that he had killed someone and devastated an entire family.  As parents we often tell our children these things, but they too often tune us out.

1114866,ACH3XM6K1M4AK,B000XSKDBA,L. Jonsson,"[8, 10]","In this MTV-like cautionary DVD, the tale of Steve Leslie is told.  At the age of 23, he drank and used methamphetamine, chose to drive, led police on a car chase that led to him rear ending the car of Jeremy Turner, a 19 year old.  He killed Turner instantly by causing the car to explode.  Leslie was given a 17 year minimum sentence for his crimes of murder, felony DUI, felony resisting arrest, and felony evading arrest. Russell Turner, Jeremy's Dad, shares his tragedy by talking to high schools about the dangers of drinking and driving, and interviewing Steve Leslie about his actions in jail.  Instead of telling the story in a straightforward way, the DVD shows many images of Jeremy growing up, and of children and teenagers in general at different times in their lives. It intersperses these images with pictures of collisions and people covered in blood that have been in DUI accidents. The editing is crisp, but sometimes confusing as to what tale is really being told.  Visually this short film is stunning, but the different images shown make it sometimes difficult to concentrate on the real story of what happened to Jeremy Turner. Also interspersed in the segments on the Turner family and Steve Leslie is the funeral of a young adult named Brooks.  We are not introduced to his family in any way other than what we see in the emergency room of his family and of what his FAther says about him in Brooks's funeral.  This was confusing, but did add to the emotional impact of the DVD in showing the devastation a DUI can cause to the remaining family members. My only problem with this DVD is I would have liked to have known more about this family above, and I would have liked more information on Jeremy Turner before his death.The impact of what Steven Leslie did will forever alter the lives of the Turner family.  However, this DVD can possibly make someone choose to make a low risk choice; and not drink and drive.  This DVD is great to show to groups who have to go to treatment due to having a DUI, because it can show them what might have been.  A felony DUI is devastating to the offenders family, as well as the victims family.  Steve Leslie has not regularly interacted with his wife or son for years, and that is a direct consequence of his felony DUI conviction.",4,"""The death of a young person is the ultimate obscenity""",1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,2295,"['MTV-like', 'cautionary', 'DVD', 'tale', 'Steve', 'Leslie', 'told', 'age', '23', 'drank', 'used', 'methamphetamine', 'chose', 'drive', 'led', 'police', 'car', 'chase', 'led', 'rear', 'ending', 'car', 'Jeremy', 'Turner', '19', 'year', 'old', 'killed', 'Turner', 'instantly', 'causing', 'car', 'explode', 'Leslie', 'was', 'given', '17', 'year', 'minimum', 'sentence', 'crimes', 'murder', 'felony', 'DUI', 'felony', 'resisting', 'arrest', 'felony', 'evading', 'arrest', 'Russell', 'Turner', 'Jeremy', 'Dad', 'shares', 'tragedy', 'talking', 'high', 'schools', 'dangers', 'drinking', 'driving', 'interviewing', 'Steve', 'Leslie', 'actions', 'jail', 'Instead', 'telling', 'story', 'straightforward', 'way', 'DVD', 'many', 'images', 'Jeremy', 'growing', 'up', 'children', 'teenagers', 'general', 'different', 'times', 'lives', 'images', 'pictures', 'collisions', 'people', 'covered', 'blood', 'have', 'been', 'DUI', 'accidents', 'editing', 'crisp', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'what', 'tale', 'really', 'being', 'told', 'Visually', 'short', 'film', 'stunning', 'different', 'images', 'shown', 'make', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'concentrate', 'real', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'Jeremy', 'Turner', 'Also', 'interspersed', 'segments', 'Turner', 'family', 'Steve', 'Leslie', 'funeral', 'young', 'adult', 'named', 'Brooks', 'are', 'not', 'introduced', 'family', 'way', 'other', 'what', 'see', 'emergency', 'room', 'family', 'what', 'FAther', 'Brooks', 'funeral', 'was', 'confusing', 'did', 'add', 'emotional', 'impact', 'DVD', 'showing', 'devastation', 'DUI', 'can', 'cause', 'remaining', 'family', 'members', 'only', 'problem', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'more', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'information', 'Jeremy', 'Turner', 'death.The', 'impact', 'what', 'Steven', 'Leslie', 'did', 'will', 'forever', 'alter', 'lives', 'Turner', 'family', 'However', 'DVD', 'can', 'possibly', 'make', 'someone', 'choose', 'make', 'low', 'risk', 'choice', 'not', 'drink', 'drive', 'DVD', 'great', 'show', 'groups', 'who', 'have', 'go', 'treatment', 'due', 'having', 'DUI', 'can', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'felony', 'DUI', 'devastating', 'offenders', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'victims', 'family', 'Steve', 'Leslie', 'not', 'regularly', 'interacted', 'wife', 'son', 'years', 'direct', 'consequence', 'felony', 'DUI', 'conviction']",N/A
