I just ordered 2 copies of this from amazon only to find out that I received the defective versions. These have the first 3 minute prologue, before the opening credits, cut off.  Amazon sent replacements and now I have 4 defective dvd's in my collection.  I am contacting the BFS company to see if they will replace these and I may ask amazon for a refund.  I am confused and this was a royal pain.  Apparently, the BFS has released corrected versions, but where are these?  Update:  Amazon very nicely refunded my money, but the company that made the dvd's returned my e-mails only after some time.

Capuano,"[3, 3]","Little Men was a great show, based on the novel of Louisa May Alcot--Little Men.There have been 2 releases of Little Men--Little Men set 1 containing four episodes: Changes, Quarantine, Thanksgiving, and Tough Crimes. And Little Men set 2, also containing four episodes: Emancipation, Christmas Angle, Philanthropy, and Bluffing. The four episodes on the first set are really great as are the next four that are on this set. They encourage great life lessons for kids and are shows that the whole family will enjoy.However, Little Men set 2 will be the last release of this great series as I have written to BFS Entertainment and Multimedia Limited requesting that they finish the release of Little Men and got this reply below:___________________________________________________________________Thanks for your input.
