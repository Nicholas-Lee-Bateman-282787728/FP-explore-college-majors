680188,A18EQJARJMX2IR,B00005RRJH,"BhamGhostwriter ""Patrick""","[2, 2]","THE TOILERS AND THE WAYFARERS is an endearing and provocative teen love/coming of age/coming out tale set in 1990s Minnesota. It's centered around the very beautiful protagonist Dieter and two of his friends - one of them being Phillip, a longtime school mate who has, at least at the beginning, deep feelings for Dieter.Ultimately a moving and sweet (or, perhaps more accurately, bittersweet) treatment, the great cinematography and black-and-white processing are perfect for its often bleak narrative and settings (which are given occasional comic relief by Dieter's newer friend Udo, who just immigrated from Germany).When Dieter and Phillip - with a sudden kiss - very physically discover each other's gayness early in the story, that scene - with its outdoor setting - will take your breath away by the depth of its seeming simplicity. Your heart will skip a beat in empathy as Phillip tells Dieter how ""beautiful"" he is even though Dieter is not quite ready to admit his own gayness.Phillip then totally comes out and runs away from their small town because of Dieter's denial. The beautiful boy's subsequent search for Phillip and for the truths that are hidden in Dieter's own heart form the basis for most of the rest of the film.Though indeterminate endings are often good for us in that they make us use our imaginations, I was a tad disappointed here in having to deal with the unknown futures of Phillip, Udo and - most especially - Dieter. Still, upon my first viewing ten or fifteen years ago, I totally opened MY heart to these 3 boys and it remains open to them now - many years after the movie was originally released on VHS.I love this movie.",5,Independent gay cinema at its best,1253318400,"09 19, 2009",2009,1661,"['TOILERS', 'THE', 'WAYFARERS', 'endearing', 'provocative', 'teen', 'love/coming', 'age/coming', 'out', 'tale', 'set', '1990s', 'Minnesota', 'centered', 'very', 'beautiful', 'protagonist', 'Dieter', 'two', 'friends', 'one', 'being', 'Phillip', 'longtime', 'school', 'mate', 'who', 'least', 'beginning', 'deep', 'feelings', 'Dieter.Ultimately', 'moving', 'sweet', 'perhaps', 'more', 'accurately', 'bittersweet', 'treatment', 'great', 'cinematography', 'black-and-white', 'processing', 'are', 'perfect', 'often', 'bleak', 'narrative', 'settings', 'are', 'given', 'occasional', 'comic', 'relief', 'Dieter', 'newer', 'friend', 'Udo', 'who', 'just', 'immigrated', 'Germany', '.When', 'Dieter', 'Phillip', 'sudden', 'kiss', 'very', 'physically', 'discover', 'other', 'gayness', 'early', 'story', 'scene', 'outdoor', 'setting', 'will', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'depth', 'seeming', 'simplicity', 'heart', 'will', 'skip', 'beat', 'empathy', 'Phillip', 'Dieter', 'how', 'beautiful', 'even', 'Dieter', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'admit', 'own', 'gayness.Phillip', 'then', 'totally', 'out', 'runs', 'away', 'small', 'town', 'Dieter', 'denial', 'beautiful', 'boy', 'subsequent', 'search', 'Phillip', 'truths', 'are', 'hidden', 'Dieter', 'own', 'heart', 'basis', 'most', 'rest', 'film.Though', 'indeterminate', 'endings', 'are', 'often', 'good', 'make', 'use', 'imaginations', 'was', 'tad', 'disappointed', 'here', 'having', 'deal', 'unknown', 'futures', 'Phillip', 'Udo', 'most', 'especially', 'Dieter', 'Still', 'first', 'viewing', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'totally', 'opened', 'MY', 'heart', '3', 'boys', 'open', 'now', 'many', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'VHS.I', 'love', 'movie']",N/A

Filming  in black and white always adds that independent touch.  I may be a bit bias (since I live in St Paul MN), as the film was set in New Ulm Minnesota, and is filmed on location in Minneapolis - scenes on and around Hennepin Avenue, including one outside the Gay 90's, once but no longer an institution in the gay clubs of the Twin Cities.The Story: We follow the plight of 3 young (and likely  gay) teens coming of age in a small rural Minnesota town.  Dieter, Phillip and Udo (who arrives  from Ulm Germany to live with his Aunt, who soon dies) become pals in the most unusual of ways.  Eventually, Phillips ends up on the streets of Minneapolis, and Dieter and Udo are left to  contend with family conflict in New Ulm.  Suffice to say, I'll need to visit New Ulm one day.  The film eventually leads us to Minneapolis where Dieter and Phillip reunite, and passions flare as the two deal with lust, love, hustling and survival.  Udo is pretty much out of the storyline at this point.  I can't say much more without leading you towards the ending.What I Liked:  I don't think the film ever developed a ""time period"", so one must judge based  on cars, and other factors.  I would say the film, originally released in Theaters in 1997, is  set in the early to mid 80's.  Though the word AIDS is never uttered, we are left to wonder  what will become of our boys from New Ulm, outcast from their families.  Hustling for sex in  the 80's was not a good thing (is it ever actually).  The film is mostly serious, with some humor (mostly thanks to  Udo) and is primarily in English, though several scenes, especially early, are in German with  English subtitles, which for me, just adds to the film.  A nice collection of DVD extras too.What I Didn't Like: Nothing really, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and will keep it on my  collection.  It is a solid 4 and since I cannot think of any negatives, I am going to give it a  5.Final Word:  I loved the West St Paul tow truck, the Minneapolis night street scenes at dusk in  black and white - and the German humor of Udo.  The storyline is tender and heartfelt, and the  young actors are stunning in all regards.

680191,AI54XO5Z755FH,B00005RRJH,"Drake-by-the-Lake ""movie critic""","[13, 14]","The filmmaker's artsy choice of black and white film works, though we might wonder how it might have looked in the customary full color. I have come to conclude that black and white film used nowadays is an affectation meant to convey the impression of high art.Dialogue consists of 50% German and 50% English, though with the subtitles, language poses no barrier. Actually, the character's German-American heritage adds exotic spice, a new wrinkle to the by-now familiar genre of gay hustler movies.I should clarify that ""Wayfarers"" is not so much about hustling's lurid aspects than it is the realistic story of a teen runaway, Dieter, physically an archetypal Aryan youth, personally an insightful, gentle young man, if rebellious towards his cold father. He has two friends, the older of which is Udo, a loser alky, though not unappealing, gentle and dumb and little fluent in English. Udo's orientation has little bearing on events, other than prejudicing his elders against him, and he might as well have been straight for the purposes of the movie.Dieter's younger buddy Phillip's effeminate manners may repel, but his good looks and candid love for Dieter win us over in the end. Possibly, the script favors him with better lines, but whatever the reason, the actor who plays Phillip, Andrew Woodhouse, shines the brightest in this film for the extra ""oomph"" with which he delivers his lines, his expressive eyes always searching, his face animated with feeling. I should like to see more movies with this new (to me) actor. According to IMDB, Andrew Woodhouse has not starred in any major productions since this 1996 film; why?""Wayfarers"" neither descends into an obvious morality lesson nor gratuitous eroticism, though rest assured, you will be awarded your expected ration, almost entirely of Dieter, including a full-body rear, a flaccid frontal, and, what is quite unusual in modern films, a lengthy, bare, otk spanking scene where Dieter is punished by his German father. For the sake of art and beauty alone, though not necessarily for profundity or dramatic content, I would recommend this as an addition to your collection.",4,"A smart little film, with an eye to pleasing the viewer",1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,2141,"['filmmaker', 'artsy', 'choice', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'works', 'might', 'wonder', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'customary', 'full', 'color', 'have', 'come', 'conclude', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'used', 'nowadays', 'affectation', 'meant', 'convey', 'impression', 'high', 'art.Dialogue', '50', '%', 'German', '50', '%', 'English', 'subtitles', 'language', 'barrier', 'Actually', 'character', 'German-American', 'heritage', 'exotic', 'spice', 'new', 'wrinkle', 'by-now', 'familiar', 'genre', 'gay', 'hustler', 'movies.I', 'should', 'clarify', 'Wayfarers', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'hustling', 'lurid', 'aspects', 'realistic', 'story', 'teen', 'runaway', 'Dieter', 'physically', 'archetypal', 'Aryan', 'youth', 'personally', 'insightful', 'gentle', 'young', 'man', 'rebellious', 'towards', 'cold', 'father', 'two', 'friends', 'older', 'Udo', 'loser', 'alky', 'not', 'unappealing', 'gentle', 'dumb', 'little', 'fluent', 'English', 'Udo', 'orientation', 'little', 'bearing', 'events', 'other', 'prejudicing', 'elders', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'straight', 'purposes', 'movie.Dieter', 'younger', 'buddy', 'Phillip', 'effeminate', 'manners', 'may', 'repel', 'good', 'looks', 'candid', 'love', 'Dieter', 'win', 'end', 'Possibly', 'script', 'better', 'lines', 'reason', 'actor', 'who', 'Phillip', 'Andrew', 'Woodhouse', 'brightest', 'film', 'extra', 'oomph', 'lines', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'always', 'searching', 'face', 'animated', 'feeling', 'should', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'new', 'actor', 'According', 'IMDB', 'Andrew', 'Woodhouse', 'not', 'starred', 'major', 'productions', '1996', 'film', 'why', 'Wayfarers', 'obvious', 'morality', 'lesson', 'gratuitous', 'eroticism', 'rest', 'assured', 'will', 'be', 'awarded', 'expected', 'ration', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Dieter', 'including', 'full-body', 'rear', 'flaccid', 'frontal', 'what', 'quite', 'unusual', 'modern', 'films', 'lengthy', 'bare', 'otk', 'spanking', 'scene', 'where', 'Dieter', 'punished', 'German', 'father', 'sake', 'art', 'beauty', 'alone', 'not', 'necessarily', 'profundity', 'dramatic', 'content', 'would', 'recommend', 'addition', 'collection']",N/A

Meeting down at the river afterwards, Phillip informs Deter "" I burned my gym uniform ""; they tossel about and Phillip starts to kiss Deter; at first he looks like he might be injoying it but pushes Phillip away, ""What are you doing ?"". Gets up and runs away, Phillip apologises, but Deter keeps running down the road and you see no more of Phillip.Udo (Ralf Schrig) has moved from Germany to the USA to live with is aunt; by the way Udo is Deters cousin. Udo sits around his Aunt's house and drinks and doesn't seem to want to get a job (reminds me of a roomate I once had); auntie is not impressed.She kicks the bucket and Udo inherits aunties house and money that he squanders it on a new car etc. Well Deters family is not impressed with this behavior and is concerned with his constant compaionship and time with Deter. While Udo drives up to show Deter his new car, the father has a show down with Udo and suggest he has become to close and personal with his son, and that Uno is after Deter's body. (give the guy a break dad, he doesn't know anybody else in town his age that speaks his language)Deter speaks his opnion and defends Uno and his overly strict prussian father blows a cork and drags Deter into the house; they have words and Deter admits (you miss part of this in the subtitle???) that he is gay not Uno. I love this next scene; you see Deter's room and then hear ""F---K YOU!"" and deter enters and slams the door; pops really P.Oed now and spanks Deter on his bare bottom. Deter has had enough and goes over to Uno's and hides out there and convinces him to take to Minneapolis to join Phillip. To keep it short they do go on the road, Thelma and Louise style, and join up with Phillip (who has been writting to Deter).Uno can't hold a job; Phillip has resorted to prostitution and convinces Deter to do the same; Deter and Phillip have reconciliated and become lovers now but Detrer gets busted by the vice squad; who inform him his father doesn't want him back.Promising to show where the others live, he breaks away from the police and decides it best to leave town.I didn't like the ending; felt like it left you hanging.

Philip then runs away to Minneapolis and becomes a street hustler. The movie mainly follows Dieter's journey from his repulsion at the thought of being kissed by Philip to himself running away and becoming a street hustler.The movie is in black and white but well made and you can believe this transformation the way it is played out, even though it sounds a little far fetched just written out. The characters are well developed, and the situations are well developed to bring about the actions of each of the main characters.I don't think I will being giving away too much of the plot to add that I especially liked the fact that Dieter's father and the police are quick to place the blame for Dieter's running away and turning to prostitution on the slightly older Udo who, though somewhat of a bad influence on Dieter after Philip left, never engaged in nor encouraged the homosexual activity.Considering two characters become street hustlers it is not surprising that the movie contains some nudity. Dieter is seen fully nude from both the front and the rear both at the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie and is spanked bare bottom around the middle. Philip however is never seen nude on screen, and despite the theme there are no sex scenes in the movie. There are however a couple of intense make-out scenes, the second one getting into foreplay. In this second make-out/foreplay scene Dieter is nude and Philip is wearing under shorts and a pajama top.The behind the scenes footage in the DVD extras is good. I liked the included footage of rehearsals as well as the shots of setting up and shooting the movie scenes. It shows some interesting footage from behind the scenes without going on and on with boring details as some DVD's do.I was, however, disappointed with the audio commentary. They did not mute the movie audio while the cast and director were talking, therefore it is often hard to follow the commentary. Also the people talking on the commentary seem to move away from their mikes at times making it impossible to understand them even when the movie sound track is not drowning them out.

So many gay films (and especially ones involving hustling as a theme) are violence and drug ridden cliches that leave me cold.  In this film the characters are allowed to develop, the acting is pretty good and there is a semblence of a story outside of the usual ""hustling is a hard cold way to survive"".  To me the mark of a good film is when you actually begin to care about the characters.  This film has that.  This film also avoids cliches and sappy hollywood endings.  The end result is that you feel as if this film showed you the private lives/motivations of its' three main characters.

The grainy black-and-white effectively highlights the dreary, bleak nature of these characters' lives.  But the acting isn't so hot, and neither is the script.

It's filmed in black and white with a mix of subtitles and English. It was rather well done and an enjoyable way to spend an evening. This is a very sexy film without any detailed sex. It's done so well that it's better than seeing the detailed act, it allows for you to fill in the gaps. It gives you a wonderful story and great acting from the lead. It was well worth the cost and I got much more than I expected. The lead is very convincing as a fresh, unsoiled young man in a town that hold no hope for growth. You see him transform before you're eye's as he discovers the reality of what waits outside the small town, on the path he has to travel. This is a tastefully sexual and seductive film that will remind you of what it was to be young and unsoiled, it will excite you're senses and leave you pondering what will happen to him now?Not all the actors turned in great work so I felt four stars was fair. It's worth it for the lead. His acting was great and he looked splendid, as you will see for yourself.",4,"Art, form and grace",1069891200,"11 27, 2003",2003,1056,"['was', 'walk', 'beaten', 'path', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'mix', 'subtitles', 'English', 'was', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'very', 'sexy', 'film', 'detailed', 'sex', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'better', 'seeing', 'detailed', 'act', 'fill', 'gaps', 'wonderful', 'story', 'great', 'acting', 'lead', 'was', 'well', 'cost', 'got', 'much', 'more', 'expected', 'lead', 'very', 'convincing', 'fresh', 'unsoiled', 'young', 'man', 'town', 'hold', 'hope', 'growth', 'see', 'transform', ""'re"", 'eye', 'reality', 'what', 'waits', 'small', 'town', 'path', 'travel', 'tastefully', 'sexual', 'seductive', 'film', 'will', 'remind', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'young', 'unsoiled', 'will', 'excite', ""'re"", 'senses', 'leave', 'pondering', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'now', 'Not', 'actors', 'turned', 'great', 'work', 'so', 'felt', 'four', 'stars', 'was', 'fair', 'lead', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'looked', 'splendid', 'will', 'see']",N/A
