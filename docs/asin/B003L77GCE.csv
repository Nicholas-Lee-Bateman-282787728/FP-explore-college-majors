There are very few video presentations that I could compare, fiction or non-fiction, with ""Friday Night Lights""...only ""John Adams"" comes to mind right away. The writing, acting, casting, camera work, editing and execution at all levels and of every aspect of this series is extraordinary. Season 5 just happens to be the best of the best; as they might say in Dillon, ""It don't get no better.""""Friday Night Lights"" goes beyond show business; some might call it a religious experience about good, evil, fairness, foolishness and redemption. The viewer is exposed to the sweet victories, bitter disappointments, shocking surprises and various complexities of life as we watch these skillfull actors play out the poignant scenes that make up the series. Thankfully, the conclusion, as developed throughout Season 5, was definitive; the producers, directors, cameramen and cast brought the various loose ends to sensible and at times loving conclusions.Everyone of you that may read this: you were brilliant (again & again), and your overwhelming emotion about participation in this fine series should be one thing: PRIDE, PRIDE, PRIDE.

1351642,A2SO7CB2WP3BHD,B003L77GCE,dazie,"[1, 1]","Can you say FNL Season 5 Marathon?  There were only 13 Episodes, (at about 43 mins each, except for the last episode which did run just slightly over the hour mark to have the show culminate in, what I think, everyone who really liked this show, a satisfying end.  I Watched the entire Season 5 (which just started airing on NBC Last week) But I watched it over the course of 2 days.I am happy this show did get 5 Seasons, the show was cast perfectly and the writers have just this spot on way to create realistic and touching dialouge that goes straight to emotion and becomes life learning.  With watching these characters, Julie, Tim, Tyra, Matt, Landry, and esp Coach and his wife just grow as people over the years and struggle, yet always stay true to themselves and you are almost going thru their struggles and achievements right along with them, if the writers were going for that and ever read this, You Absolutely Succeeded.I am sad that such a great show like this that stays true and can be a Family Show wasn't recogonized and given more the credit it truly deserves.  For those of you who are FNL Fans, you will not be dissappointed in this Final Season.  It brings back some of the characters that may not have been regulars last season, we saw Jason Street, and Tyra came back for some of the later episodes this season.  I absolutely love the dynamic true to life relationship between Eric and Tammy, their FNL Marriage and how they make decisions, especially a monumental decision they must make as a couple as the Series draws to a close.The new characters introduced last season, Luke, Vince, Becky and Jess, at first took a while to warm up to, almost like they were invading our older characters who had already won a place in our hearts, but seeing them again, and how they deal with their own issues, especially Vince, who has to deal with his father being released from prison, and Vince having to see where his loyalities lie and who is really looking out for his best interests as his Father doesn't think Coach has his sons best interests, so that was a good storyline.The Becky storyline was really nice, as she, after a not so warming welcome from Mindy (Riggins) found a family that proved to truly care about her, which is what in reality, a young girl her character age really needed.Julie Taylor has a major bad decision on her part with something, but she, in Taylor fashion works thru it, learns from it, and makes a better, appropriate decision later.The music is wonderful as always, even mostly at the times the instrumentals hit at just the right time to catch that perfect moment in the show to bring things together.Just a brilliant show, please buy it, support the show, I am glad to see some of the other actors have already gotten parts in new series (Vince is on Parenthood which is an NBC Show Mondays, and Luke I think is on an ABC show, as well as Matt.)  So i'm sad to see the show end, but happy to have these actors recoginized and put in, what seem to be good series shows that are airing now.Wish I could give this Ten Stars, because it truly deserves it.",5,Amazing Series comes to an End,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,3110,"['Can', 'say', 'FNL', 'Season', '5', 'Marathon', 'were', 'only', '13', 'Episodes', 'about', '43', 'mins', 'last', 'episode', 'did', 'run', 'just', 'slightly', 'hour', 'mark', 'have', 'show', 'culminate', 'what', 'think', 'everyone', 'who', 'really', 'liked', 'show', 'satisfying', 'end', 'Watched', 'entire', 'Season', '5', 'just', 'started', 'airing', 'NBC', 'Last', 'week', 'watched', 'course', '2', 'days.I', 'am', 'happy', 'show', 'did', 'get', '5', 'Seasons', 'show', 'was', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'writers', 'have', 'just', 'spot', 'way', 'create', 'realistic', 'touching', 'dialouge', 'straight', 'emotion', 'life', 'learning', 'watching', 'characters', 'Julie', 'Tim', 'Tyra', 'Matt', 'Landry', 'esp', 'Coach', 'wife', 'just', 'grow', 'people', 'years', 'struggle', 'always', 'stay', 'true', 'are', 'almost', 'going', 'thru', 'struggles', 'achievements', 'right', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'ever', 'read', 'Absolutely', 'Succeeded.I', 'am', 'sad', 'great', 'show', 'true', 'can', 'be', 'Family', 'Show', 'was', ""n't"", 'recogonized', 'given', 'more', 'credit', 'deserves', 'who', 'are', 'FNL', 'Fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissappointed', 'Final', 'Season', 'back', 'characters', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'regulars', 'last', 'season', 'saw', 'Jason', 'Street', 'Tyra', 'came', 'back', 'later', 'episodes', 'season', 'absolutely', 'love', 'dynamic', 'true', 'life', 'relationship', 'Eric', 'Tammy', 'FNL', 'Marriage', 'how', 'make', 'decisions', 'especially', 'monumental', 'decision', 'must', 'make', 'couple', 'Series', 'close.The', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'last', 'season', 'Luke', 'Vince', 'Becky', 'Jess', 'first', 'took', 'while', 'warm', 'up', 'almost', 'were', 'invading', 'older', 'characters', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'won', 'place', 'hearts', 'seeing', 'again', 'how', 'deal', 'own', 'issues', 'especially', 'Vince', 'who', 'deal', 'father', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'Vince', 'having', 'see', 'where', 'loyalities', 'lie', 'who', 'really', 'looking', 'out', 'best', 'interests', 'Father', ""n't"", 'think', 'Coach', 'sons', 'best', 'interests', 'was', 'good', 'storyline.The', 'Becky', 'storyline', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'not', 'so', 'warming', 'welcome', 'Mindy', 'Riggins', 'found', 'family', 'proved', 'truly', 'care', 'what', 'reality', 'young', 'girl', 'character', 'age', 'really', 'needed.Julie', 'Taylor', 'major', 'bad', 'decision', 'part', 'something', 'Taylor', 'fashion', 'better', 'appropriate', 'decision', 'later.The', 'music', 'wonderful', 'always', 'even', 'mostly', 'times', 'instrumentals', 'hit', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'catch', 'perfect', 'moment', 'show', 'bring', 'things', 'together.Just', 'brilliant', 'show', 'please', 'buy', 'support', 'show', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'other', 'actors', 'have', 'already', 'gotten', 'parts', 'new', 'series', 'Vince', 'Parenthood', 'NBC', 'Show', 'Mondays', 'Luke', 'think', 'ABC', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'Matt', 'i', ""'m"", 'sad', 'see', 'show', 'end', 'happy', 'have', 'actors', 'recoginized', 'put', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'good', 'series', 'shows', 'are', 'airing', 'now.Wish', 'could', 'give', 'Ten', 'Stars', 'truly']",N/A
1351643,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003L77GCE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 5]","A final and appropriate last hurrah for ""Friday Night Lights"".  ""Friday Night Lights: The Fifth and Final Season"" was a fantastic season that gives fans a final closure to this wonderful series.In 1990, H.G. Bissinger created the non-fiction book ""Friday Night Lights: A Town, A Team, and a Dream.  In 2002, the book would be named the fourth greatest book ever written about sports by Sports Illustrated magazine.  And what followed in 2004 is a film adaptation which did very well and is considered one of the best football films ever made.And in 2006, ""Friday Night Lights"", the TV series was born.The TV series was adapted by Peter Berg, Brian Grazer and David Nevins and the first three seasons would focus on Eric Taylor (played by Kyle Chandler) and his family moving to Dillon, Texas where he would coach the Dillon Panthers.  The series would focus on Eric and his coaches preparing his football team each week and also getting to know several of the main players who make up the team and of course, the drama which surrounded them.The series would achieve critical acclaim as many felt the series had an accurate portrayal of middle America and its passion for high school football.  Unfortunately, part of the problem was that viewership was never strong and many fans would fight hard to keep this series alive.  The series would win a Peabody Award, a Humanitas Price and a Television Critics Association Award and both of the main talents Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton would be nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress awards for the 2010 Emmy Awards.While the first two seasons were broadcast on NBC, the next three seasons would be broadcast on DirectTV's 101 Network and the fans of the series were able to give ""Friday Night Lights"" a final fifth season to end the series correctly instead of canceling it without any closure for those fans.The most significant change during the five seasons of ""Friday Night Lights"" was at the end of Season Three when Coach Taylor found out about a plot to remove him as coach of the Dillon Panthers.  Season three ended with him losing his job at Dillon but being offered to coach for the not-as-tough East Dillon High, which is reopening after years of being closed.Season four was all about Eric Taylor trying to get this new team prepared for the season but the students/football players had a criminal background.  One of the star players that had potential was Vince Howard, a student who has had too much trouble with the law but Taylor has felt he had what it takes to become a star quarterback.  The team also has a star running back named Luke Cafferty who was supposed to play for the Dillon Panthers but because his address is within East Dillon's district, he would be playing for the East Dillon Lions.While Eric focuses on building his team, other students get used to their new schools.  Matt Saracen is trying to get used to the new school but unfortunately, his father is killed in Iraq and throughout season, he deals with his personal problems and abruptly moves to Chicago and leaves Julie Taylor behind.Meanwhile the Riggins brothers run into trouble when Tim Riggins and his brother start up a chop shop and ends up being busted and while Tim's brother is responsible, because he has a baby boy, Tim takes the wrap and ends up going to prison.By the end of the fourth season, East Dillon High School has a losing record with only two wins and Tami Taylor ends up getting into controversy when a girl wants to get an abortion and she supports her decision and because of that, conservatives put pressure on the school and getting her fired.This leads to the fifth and final season of ""Friday Night Lights"".It's a new school year and Tami is now a guidance counselor at East Dillon High School, Julie and Landry are moving away to go to college, Tim Riggins is in prison and Eric tries to get his team ready for the new football season and sure enough, the East Dillon High School Lions who had a losing season last year, may be the best team in the district.""Friday Night Lights: The Fifth and Final Season"" includes the following episodes (spoilerless summaries):DISC 1:* EPISODE 64: Expectations - Julie and Landry spend their last moments in town before going off to college.  Meanwhile, Tami wants to take initiative as the new guidance counselor at East Dillon.* EPISODE 65: On the Outside Looking In - When East Dillon is not ranked after beating a ranked team, everyone gets upset!  Luke tries to revive his relationship with Becky and Jess deals with Vince's ""rally girl"".* EPISODE 66: The Right Hand of the Father - Vince's absentee father shows up out of nowhere, Julie starts to fall for a married man and Buddy has his son live with him.* EPISODE 67: Keep Looking - Vince continues to have problems with his dad being at home, Buddy meanwhile has to handle his drunken son and Mindy makes a big decision on what to do with Becky.DISC 2:* EPISODE 68: Kingdom - Lions take on their rival South King, meanwhile Julie is confronted by the wife of the man she is sleeping with.* EPISODE 69: Swerve - Julie tells her parents of what happened at school.  Meanwhile, Vince is being threatened that if he doesn't pay a thug his $5,000, he would be killed.* EPISODE 70: Perfect Record - East Dilon Lions takes on their rivals, the West Dillon Panthers. Meanwhile, someone has leaked to the press about the criminal records of some of the East Dillon Lions players.* EPISODE 71: Fracture - Tami looks into Epyck's home life and Julie's ex tries to visit her at their home.* EPISODE 72: Gut Check - As Vince's head gets bigger and bigger, it's affecting the team and Coach Taylor bench's him for a game and makes Luke a quarterback.Disc 3:* EPISODE 73: Don't Go - Rumors are swirling that Coach Taylor may leave East Dillon to coach a college team.* EPISODE 74: The March - Budget cuts are affecting the district and Tami is offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.* EPISODE 75: Texas Whatever - The future of the East Dillon High School football team is hanging on a thread as budget cuts will lead to one football program.* EPISODE 76: Always - The Taylor family must make an important decision on their future.VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Friday Night Lights"" is presented in anamorphic widescreen (1:78:1), English Dolby Digital 5.1 and subtitles are in English SDH.  Picture quality for ""Friday Night Lights"" is good as the majority of the series is film outdoors.  There is a good amount of grain for the series but because it's on DVD, you can expect to see some edge enhancement, mild interlacing and compression artifacts as well.As for audio, dialogue is clear and understandable and is front channel-driven.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Friday Night Lights: The Fifth and Final Season"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1* Deleted Scenes - Featuring deleted scenes from ""Expectations"".* Yearbook - Featuring photos from 2007-2011 which you can navigate with your remote control.DISC 2* Deleted Scenes: Featuring deleted scenes from ""Perfect Record"" and ""Fracture"".DISC 3* Deleted Scenes: Featuring deleted scenes from ""Don't Go"", ""Texas Whatever""* The Lights Go Out - (30:00) A featurette featuring the cast and crew talk about how everyone was family and what they loved about working on the series and their thoughts on the series final season.* Audio Commentary for ""Don't Go"" - Featuring audio commentary by director Michael Waxman.* Audio Commentary for ""Always"" - Featuring audio commentary with executive producer/showrunner Jason Katims.EXTRAS:""Friday Night Lights: The Fifth and Final Season"" comes with a slip over cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:I have had the opportunity to watch ""Friday Night Lights"" from its very first episode and I can tell you right now, I love this show!I love how accurately it depicts high school football, I love the energy that is displayed in each episode during each ball game but most of all, how wonderful the acting for the series is.  I have watched Kyle Chandler grow as an actor from ""Early Edition"" and to see him act wonderfully in this role as Eric Taylor in ""Friday Night Lights"".  He has the demeanor of a high school football coach, hard as nails, no-nonsense and very effective.And you have to have a character that balances the school life and the problems that go on with the school and that is where actress Connie Britton, who plays Eric Taylor's wife Tami is also just as effective.  While Eric handles the problems on the field and also dealing with his players off-the-field, Tami is right there trying to help troubled students any way she can.And while these two are like the show's patriarchs, its the many characters who played the students that gave life to the series.  Their problems are real and these are problems that people can identify with.  Alcoholic or drug abusing parents, parents in jail, students who get carried away with their fame, students who are pregnant, students who get into trouble, students learning from their bad decisions and sure, these are situations that happens every week but instead of being a rehash of been-there, done-that, the writers have done an exceptional job in coming up with storylines that are fresh and new.There was a good balance from both sides...football and the emotional drama and there were many times that there was no sugar coating.  Things happen in this series to keep things going along and in season five, we see the Taylor family go through highs and lows but most of all seeing their marriage put to the test.  So much has been focused on Eric Taylor's quest as a coach and his loving and supportive wife being there for him through thick and thin, but when she is offered a once-in-a-lifetime career opportunity, will Eric Taylor give up all that he loves about football and coaching for his wife?  What will happen to these students as budget cuts continue to hurt their school and schools must unify?The final season of ""Friday Night Lights"" may be a sad goodbye to a fantastic series that really never pulled in a lot of viewers but it was a damn good show!  It's a series that had a lot of heart and anyone can relate to it.  The writers did a wonderful job in creating an appropriate send-off for the series and each character, especially the Taylor family.If you love the series or if you watched the earlier seasons and missed the others, while it is great to watch these seasons in order, you can watch ""Friday Night Lights: The Fifth and Final Season"" with no problems at all and still enjoy it.Although short, it was a wonderful final season of ""Friday Night Lights"".  This DVD box set is highly recommended!",5,This is one series I will definitely miss!

One thing that FNL can claim that the other two cannot is that its final season may have been its best.Eric Taylor is back at East Dillon, but the East Dillon Lions are not a laughingstock anymore.  Vince is the real deal, and the rest of the players have benefitted from a year of Coach Taylor's discipline.  It's success that the East Dillon players have to learn to deal with now.  Dirty Texas high school football politics rears its ugly head, and Vince is pressured by recruiters on one side and his father, fresh out of prison, on the other.Self-aware that it's in its final season, FNL gives us a victory lap of sorts.  Almost all of the departed characters return for at least a cameo, but it's the newer characters that carry the season.  Tim Riggins returns after a short stint in prison, but, in the biggest surprise of the season, his older brother Billy Riggins plays a larger role.  Becky's and Luke's stories are a strength, and Vince has as much pathos as Saracen ever had.

Now after having watched all 5 seasons I now conclude this is one of the finest television shows I have ever watched. I now realize that season 1 thru 3 had the perfect characters, such chemistry between actors is rarely seen. Season 4 and 5 too were excellent. I felt to some degree Hollywood imposed a little of their own morality on Dillion, TX. But it was still great. I don't think you can do wrong watching this series if you haven't. It was described as a poignant drama, and it certainly was. You laugh at times, you cry at times. You see yourself at an earlier age and remember those struggles you had growing up.

Without any spoilers I will say the final season was a great season to go out on. They say that lights shine the brightest right before they burn out and the finale truly proved it. I'm sure many if not all of the fans who have watched it agree (if you haven't been able to view it yet you are in for a treat).This season was jampacked with stories. I can only imagine how great it would have been had they had 22 episodes like the first season, but the 13 episode season has been as satisfying as any fan could hope for, especially with the beautifully done series finale. Connie Britton and Kyle Chandler continue to ground the show with their amazing performances and all around the acting is terrific. While, as another reviewer said, there is a noticeable lack of football games that we actually get to see there is no shortage in writing quality or character development. Not only are they doing great service to the new cast that was introduced last year, giving them each a chance to really grow as actors and characters, they are calling back and giving each of the original characters a curtain call of some kind.We get to say farewell to Landry and Grandma Saracen and not to spoil anything but Jason Street and Tyra appear in key moments this season. Matt Saracen makes a brief and welcomed return and Tim Riggins (despite going to jail at the end of last season) does get a chance to finish his character arc. On top of that Smash and Lyla even get nice mentions to show that the writers and the characters haven't forgotten about them. Truly a nostalgic season that has kept true to the spirit and heart the show has always had.The fifth and final season is made up of the following 13 episodes for those interested:ExpectationsOn the Outside Looking InThe Right Hand of the FatherKeep LookingKingdomSwervePerfect RecordFractureGut CheckDon't GoThe MarchTexas WhateverAlways (An extended hour long finale)The episode ""Always"" was truly the best most complete series finale I have ever seen. Simply amazing.That's 9 hours and 40 minutes in your favorite fictional Texas small town. Presented in Anamorphic Widescreen format as always with English Dolby Digital 5.1 sound and English subtitles.Special Features:Deleted ScenesFeaturette - When the Lights Go Out: An emotional and entertaining journey through all five seasons as cast and crew say goodbye. (Having now watched this feature I can say it is excellent, fans get what is really a 30 minute documentary into the life of series and then the work that goes into making episodes. It all ends with the filming of the final scene and is full of interviews with Jason Katims, Peter Berg, all the key actors who appeared this season and the people who help create the show. Worth the price of purchase for me).Commentaries - Don't Go commentary by director Michael WaxmanAlways commentary by Executive Producer and Showrunner Jason KatimsAnyways, this is a GREAT show, obviously 5 stars from me and while I wish it could've gone on longer I think most people will be happy with the way they got to spend the final season wrapping up loose ends and really bringing the series to a FANTASTIC CLOSE. While I wish, now more than ever after watching the finale, that it could continue I couldn't be happier with how they ended it by calling back to the past five seasons. If you haven't seen the show then now is the time to go back and get into it on DVD.

While you can certainly knock it for its Texas forever stances, its twangy accents and awh-chucks view points, you can not deny that it is more real than we'd like to remember or believe.

I have been an ardent fan of this series since the beginning and I wanted it to end on a strong note. And, for me, it did. It was beautiful. It made me cry and it made me think and it made me smile. It inspired me, just as the four seasons prior had, to strive to be a better person and to be ever more compassionate.  There were so many wonderful ""reunions"" with old favorites and even though I needed plenty of Kleenex in the finale and even though I wish this series could go on and on, I really was satisfied by the ending.I am so impressed by the way so many of these characters came alive and became so special to me each season.  I was amazed at how quickly and how deeply I came to care about the East Dillon Lions in Season 4 and by the end of Season 5, I was such a huge fan and probably equally invested in Becky, Jess, Vince and Luke as I had been and continue to be with Jason, Lyla, Tyra, Smash, and, of course, Landry, Matt, Julie, and Tim (who we get to see relatively ongoingly through the five seasons).  And, Coach and Mrs. T remain the amazing heart of this show and should be showered with every accolade and award possible.  I could regain a whole lot more respect for the Emmys if they honor this pair this year with Best Actor and Actress.There are many wonderful and articulate reviews already for this DVD.  Count me in as one more loyal and devoted fan who was pleased and thankful to have her favorite show ever end on such a strong note.  One person mentioned that the sum is greater than its parts and I think that is true of all the seasons.  I am sure if someone pointed out a storyline foible or a wish for X, Y or Z to have appeared more or shown up in the finale, I would not disagree.  But that said, it's as close to perfect as I could wish.I am overwhelmed with the urge to write a giant thank you note and love letter to EVERY SINGLE PERSON who contributed to this show! The actors, the writers, the direction, the beauty of the filming itself, the editing, and all the other roles of which I really don't know not being in this industry.  You created something so special!!!  What a beautiful and real reflection on living gracefully and with dignity and strength in hard times, and with fortitude when picking one's self up from making a mistake, and for compassion and encouragement for each other when trying to improve.  What a wonderful show to depict what a marriage can be--best relationship I have EVER seen depicted anywhere!

I thought I was so open minded, but I believe I was given a good lesson in the powerful influence of family and local culture in America.I have never played football, but I have a new found understanding of the hardcore football culture and even though I know it is not like in Texas in my home state of Illinois, as a football fan, I think I now, more that ever, respect what it takes to get to the pros.From top to bottom in Dillon society, from the lousiest players, to the football stars, coaches, educators, board members, politicians, business people, family, husbands and wives, they showed that us, like them, we have so many problems and ethical decisions to make.I will surely miss Friday Night Lights.

But, this being a show primarily about high-schoolers, the cast was bound to change (and did) over the course of the fourth season and this final effort.  Though the characters, places, and events changed radically as ""Friday Night Lights"" wound down in this season, it managed to keep the prized asset that had allowed it to succeed for so many years in the first place: heart.While still always keeping the Taylor family as its ""base camp"", Season Five pretty much makes the complete transition from the ""old gang"" to the likes of Vince Howard, Luke Cafferty, Becky Sproles, Jess Merriweather, & Billy Riggins.  It is their stories that dominate the better part of the season, with the old favorites sprinkled in from time to time leading up to the big finale.Though completely remaking the cast of a TV drama is very tricky business (and I would argue that it can never fully recapture the ""glory days"" of old), ""FNL"" does it in about the best way possible.  The Taylors are the one constant, and then the solid writing & character development does the rest.  Ironically enough, this new batch of characters (while never quite living up to the first season or two of stories) is far more interesting to watch then, say, the Third Season when even the beloved regulars began to get a little stale.The series finale is, of course, a major highlight of this experience, and it is done in a touching fashion despite all the cast turnover.  The writers knew exactly what to focus on and how to wrap things up while walking the fine line between sappy and realistic.Overall, the Fifth Season of ""Friday Night Lights"" is still solid dramatic television.  Though it may start off a little slow compared to other seasons, within an episode or two it will continue providing those emotional/inspirational moments you have come to expect.",4,"New Characters, Same Heart",1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,1966,"['first', 'season', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'introduced', 'viewers', 'amazing', 'cast', 'characters', 'carried', 'show', 'three', 'seasons', 'being', 'show', 'primarily', 'high-schoolers', 'cast', 'was', 'bound', 'change', 'did', 'course', 'fourth', 'season', 'final', 'effort', 'characters', 'places', 'events', 'changed', 'radically', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'wound', 'down', 'season', 'managed', 'keep', 'prized', 'asset', 'had', 'allowed', 'succeed', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'first', 'place', 'heart.While', 'still', 'always', 'keeping', 'Taylor', 'family', 'base', 'camp', 'Season', 'Five', 'pretty', 'much', 'complete', 'transition', 'old', 'gang', 'likes', 'Vince', 'Howard', 'Luke', 'Cafferty', 'Becky', 'Sproles', 'Jess', 'Merriweather', 'Billy', 'Riggins', 'stories', 'dominate', 'better', 'part', 'season', 'old', 'favorites', 'sprinkled', 'time', 'time', 'leading', 'up', 'big', 'finale.Though', 'completely', 'remaking', 'cast', 'TV', 'drama', 'very', 'tricky', 'business', 'would', 'argue', 'can', 'never', 'fully', 'recapture', 'glory', 'days', 'old', 'FNL', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'Taylors', 'are', 'one', 'constant', 'then', 'solid', 'writing', 'character', 'development', 'rest', 'Ironically', 'enough', 'new', 'batch', 'characters', 'never', 'quite', 'living', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'stories', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'then', 'say', 'Third', 'Season', 'when', 'even', 'beloved', 'regulars', 'began', 'get', 'little', 'stale.The', 'series', 'finale', 'course', 'major', 'highlight', 'experience', 'done', 'touching', 'fashion', 'cast', 'turnover', 'writers', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'focus', 'how', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'walking', 'fine', 'line', 'sappy', 'realistic.Overall', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'still', 'solid', 'dramatic', 'television', 'may', 'start', 'off', 'little', 'slow', 'compared', 'other', 'seasons', 'episode', 'two', 'will', 'continue', 'providing', 'emotional/inspirational', 'moments', 'have', 'come', 'expect']",N/A
