While I watched this I was thinking about it being a real long television episode.  This is partially biased due to my dislike of cute legendary Pokemon.  I think their plots really dwindle.  Although Suicune is one of my favorites I think a little more air time with him would have been more exciting.  I was thinking delving deeper into a connection between Suicune and Celebi.,3,Perhaps the Downfall,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,501,"['official', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'review', 'part', '5', '10', 'Pokemon', '4ever', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'predecessors', 'had', 'been', 'watched', 'was', 'thinking', 'being', 'real', 'long', 'television', 'episode', 'partially', 'biased', 'due', 'dislike', 'cute', 'legendary', 'Pokemon', 'think', 'plots', 'really', 'dwindle', 'Suicune', 'one', 'favorites', 'think', 'little', 'more', 'air', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'exciting', 'was', 'thinking', 'delving', 'deeper', 'connection', 'Suicune', 'Celebi']",Pokemon 4Ever: Movie
730152,A10FHA5E7VEDTW,B00007KK1E,Colin Y.,"[4, 4]","Yes, it's definitely the most stylish of the four so far released in the US. The entire movie takes place in a forest, so they decided to do some creative computer animation and special visuals. The forest-themed threat of walking tree branches in the form of Wargreymon called forth by a possessed Celebi was a neat touch.This movie, very much like the third one, was more about art direction and visuals than a good story. This is most apparent in the far-too-long scene in which Celebi takes Ash and his new friend Sammy flying with him. This scene does absolutely nothing other than show off the forest. It doesn't move the plot in any way, shape, or form. Also, Jesse, James, and Meowth are put way way in the back seat for this movie, since a new Team Rocket member has come to steal the show.Strong points? Excellent animation, the best of all the movies. Also, of all the Legendary Pokemon, Celebi is the most loveable. Even more loveable than Mew. Also, the Pikachu short is pretty entertaining. I'm sure a lot of people out there would love to see Pokemon get attacked by a raging lawnmower. Come on admit, you can't wait to see Pokemon get attacked by a raging lawnmower. Well, that's on this DVD.And, of course, the best part of any Pokemon DVD: the commentary. I remember listening to it on the first one and I really liked those two guys, Norman Grossfeld and Michael Haigney. This time, they brought in some guests, including a writer and the cast. WARNING: About the guy who does the voice of Meowth, MEOWTH'S VOICE IS HIS REAL VOICE. Don't get freaked when you hear it because I warned you. Sadly, the commentary ends way before the movie does. I've never seen that before, weird.Anyway, if you want to see Pokemon get attacked by a raging lawnmower, then get this DVD. If not, well the commentary is entertaining, even if it is short.

Ash & friends stop him...In my opinion, this is where the Pokemon movies started going downhill. It wasn't bad enough that the brains behind the franchise keep making more Pokemon, most of them ridiculously stupid. Then they tried to force ""light"" and ""dark"" Pokemon on us, which is very superfluous. But they keep making these super powerful legendary Pokemon, and then putting them in these movies in situations where they seem so weak. Why? I don't get it.They should make these movies where the focus Pokemon kicks butt. Like the first few movies. Mewtwo, Lugia, they were beasts. Even Entei represented well. That's what they need to get back to.Maybe I'm being a little overly analytical. After all, it IS a kid's movie.

730160,AD1JV9Y36NKPQ,B00007KK1E,J. Nickerson,"[15, 17]","After a short, limited release in theaters last year, Pokemon 4Ever is finally coming to video courtesy of Miramax. And while it's not the vast improvement to the previous Warner Bros DVD releases we were hoping for, it is still a decent offering.The story, basically, is that Ash and company come across a boy named Sam and a Celebi, who have traveled 40 years from the past. But before Celebi can bring Sam back to his own time, it is captured by the Iron Mask Marauder, who captures Celebi using a Dark Ball, and transforms it into a destructive monster. While the Marauder and Celebi destroy the forest, Ash and Sam must try and save Celebi. There are some surprisingly emotional scenes in the movie, especially towards the end as we find out the fate of Celebi and Sam's relationship with Ash.The DVD offers trailers for this movie and the Japanese trailer for the fifth movie, as well as previews for other Miramax titles. Fans will be pleased to know that the Pikachu short has been restored for the DVD, and as usually, it's pretty funny and features plenty of cute Pokemon. It also a multi-angle animation progression feature, but the footage shown is very brief; each of the four segments clock in at barely under a few seconds, if that. One major complaint about this DVD is that despite the fact that this is the fourth Pokemon feature, it is still only presented on DVD in FULLSCREEN. There are many instances in the movie where a character is speaking, but you can't see him or her, since they are cropped off the screen. I'd hoped this unfortunate tradition was left behind with Warner Bros, but the curse follows the series to Miramax. Listen up, Miramax, we don't mind the black bars on the screen, we really don't. This problem is even worse when compared with the Warner releases, because the picture seems to be zoomed in a bit more and after repeated viewings, you actually begin to notice that the screen is constantly wobbling. A very poor transfer.Another complaint, though not as major, is the commentary featuring the producers and the cast. While it's fun to finally hear what the actors really sound like, they don't really react to anything on-screen; it's more like a Q&A; session. While it does answer some interesting questions, it would have been better off to leave it as a separate feature and keep a regular commentary with just the producers. The commentary track also only runs under an hour, so it cuts off with about 20 minutes of the movie left to go. Hopefully they won't do this with movie 5, since the commentaries are my favorites part of the Pokemon movies.Otherwise, it's a solid film, and fans will be pleased that the movie sticks very close to the original Japanese script. It won't convert any Pokemon haters, but then again, nothing probably would.Just please, Miramax, when you release movie 5 on DVD, please do so in widescreen.",3,Maybe not 4ever...,1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,2882,"['short', 'limited', 'release', 'theaters', 'last', 'year', 'Pokemon', '4Ever', 'finally', 'coming', 'video', 'courtesy', 'Miramax', 'not', 'vast', 'improvement', 'previous', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'DVD', 'were', 'hoping', 'still', 'decent', 'offering.The', 'story', 'basically', 'Ash', 'company', 'come', 'boy', 'named', 'Sam', 'Celebi', 'who', 'have', 'traveled', '40', 'years', 'past', 'Celebi', 'can', 'bring', 'Sam', 'back', 'own', 'time', 'captured', 'Iron', 'Mask', 'Marauder', 'who', 'Celebi', 'using', 'Dark', 'Ball', 'destructive', 'monster', 'Marauder', 'Celebi', 'destroy', 'forest', 'Ash', 'Sam', 'must', 'try', 'save', 'Celebi', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'movie', 'especially', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'fate', 'Celebi', 'Sam', 'relationship', 'Ash.The', 'DVD', 'trailers', 'movie', 'Japanese', 'trailer', 'fifth', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'previews', 'other', 'Miramax', 'titles', 'Fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'know', 'Pikachu', 'short', 'been', 'restored', 'DVD', 'usually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'plenty', 'cute', 'Pokemon', 'also', 'multi-angle', 'animation', 'progression', 'feature', 'footage', 'shown', 'very', 'brief', 'four', 'segments', 'clock', 'barely', 'few', 'seconds', 'One', 'major', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'fact', 'fourth', 'Pokemon', 'feature', 'still', 'only', 'presented', 'DVD', 'FULLSCREEN', 'are', 'many', 'instances', 'movie', 'where', 'character', 'speaking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'are', 'cropped', 'screen', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'unfortunate', 'tradition', 'was', 'left', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'curse', 'series', 'Miramax', 'Listen', 'up', 'Miramax', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'black', 'bars', 'screen', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'problem', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'compared', 'Warner', 'releases', 'picture', 'be', 'zoomed', 'bit', 'more', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'actually', 'begin', 'notice', 'screen', 'constantly', 'wobbling', 'very', 'poor', 'transfer.Another', 'complaint', 'though', 'not', 'major', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'producers', 'cast', 'fun', 'finally', 'hear', 'what', 'actors', 'really', 'sound', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'react', 'anything', 'on-screen', 'more', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'answer', 'interesting', 'questions', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'leave', 'separate', 'feature', 'keep', 'regular', 'commentary', 'just', 'producers', 'commentary', 'track', 'also', 'only', 'hour', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'left', 'go', 'Hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'movie', '5', 'commentaries', 'are', 'favorites', 'part', 'Pokemon', 'movies.Otherwise', 'solid', 'film', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'movie', 'very', 'close', 'original', 'Japanese', 'script', 'wo', ""n't"", 'convert', 'Pokemon', 'haters', 'then', 'again', 'nothing', 'probably', 'would.Just', 'please', 'Miramax', 'when', 'release', 'movie', '5', 'DVD', 'please', 'do', 'so', 'widescreen']",Pokemon 4Ever: Movie
730161,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B00007KK1E,Lesley Aeschliman,"[0, 0]","Pokemon 4Ever clocks in at 79 minutes.  It's just the right length for the story that's being told; it's doesn't feel like it's going too fast, but it also doesn't feel like it's dragging the story out unnecessarily.On this disc, the short that ran before the film at the theater is only included on the disc as a special feature, unlike the first three movies, where you were forced to watch the short before starting into the movie.  The short included on this release is ""Pikachu's PikaBoo.""The next extra on the DVD is an audio commentary version of the film.  This is followed by the ""Pokemon 4Ever Trivia Game.""  For this extra, you use the remote to select the best answer to each of seven questions.  The game appears to cycle through sets of questions, and the cycle goes in the same order each time you put the DVD into the player.  If you get a question right, you see a clip of the film that is connected to the question.  If you get a question wrong, you see Pikachu appear on the screen, with the wrong ""WRONG"" written underneath it.Next is an extra labeled, ""Animation Progression,"" and there are four shots included: Forest Fly Through, Dust Storm, Battling a 3D Foe, and Climbing Ivy.  You use the angle button on your remote to switch from stage to stage in each sequence.  This particular feature was actually rather cumbersome.This DVD also included both the domestic trailer and the Japanese trailer for Pokemon 4Ever; however, there are no subtitles provided for the Japanese version.  ""A Sneak Peek at the Next Pokemon Movie"" is the Japanese trailer for the fifth Pokemon film; again, there were no subtitles, so you couldn't understand anything that was being said.  The lack of subtitles for the Japanese trailers makes it frustrating for the children watching this DVD, because they can't understand anything.

730162,A2T7TZBOTP68C7,B00007KK1E,"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[1, 2]","Pokemon 4Ever: Celebi: The Heart of the Forest is a great movie for Pokemon lovers of all ages.  The story is about a boy named Sam who is on a Pokemon sketching trip in the forest, when a mysterious little green alien-like Pokemon named Celebi appears.  Celebi is frantically escaping from a Pokemon hunter. Celebi's power is time travel.  (What a unique concept for a Pokemon! Just when you thought they ran out of ideas for powers and abilities). Sam and Celebi are transported forty years in the future, to Ash and Pikachu's time.The future has a bigger, badder, hunter.  The Masked Marauder of Team Rocket has a horrible Dark Pokeball.  Any Pokemon trapped in a Dark ball will turn evil, and have his powers multiply.  This concept is horrible.  Who would come up with such an evil thing in the Pokemon world where Pokemon are loved and respected?  The Marauder wants Celebi.  He trashes the forest with his evil arachnoid droid robot machine.  4Ever also features another legendary Pokemon, the beautiful and noble Suicune.  (He looks better than his name, folks).Although Pokemon is a part of American entertainment now, it is important to remember that this was originally a Japanese cartoon.  This is evident in the gentle themes of the film: protecting the forest and the spirits of the forest.  In Japan, the main religion is Shinto, which believes the natural world is full of benevolent spirits which we must honor and care for.This DVD is loaded with special features.  There is a short called ""Pikachu's Pikabu"" that is fun for kids, mind-numbing for adults.  There is a trivia game that features clips of the film with every question answered.  Both American and Japanese trailers for the film are included.  The Japanese one is fun to watch - they show the voice actors recording.  It is obvious they are having a lot of fun.  There is audio commentary, and the Japanese trailer for Pokemon 5, which is the ""sneak peek"" mentioned.  But it is not in English.",4,A Movie for Pokemon Lovers,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,1974,"['Pokemon', '4Ever', 'Celebi', 'Heart', 'Forest', 'great', 'movie', 'Pokemon', 'lovers', 'ages', 'story', 'boy', 'named', 'Sam', 'who', 'Pokemon', 'sketching', 'trip', 'forest', 'when', 'mysterious', 'little', 'green', 'alien-like', 'Pokemon', 'named', 'Celebi', 'Celebi', 'frantically', 'escaping', 'Pokemon', 'hunter', 'Celebi', 'power', 'time', 'travel', 'What', 'unique', 'concept', 'Pokemon', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'ran', 'ideas', 'powers', 'abilities', 'Sam', 'Celebi', 'are', 'transported', 'forty', 'years', 'future', 'Ash', 'Pikachu', 'time.The', 'future', 'bigger', 'badder', 'hunter', 'Masked', 'Marauder', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'horrible', 'Dark', 'Pokeball', 'Any', 'Pokemon', 'trapped', 'Dark', 'ball', 'will', 'turn', 'evil', 'have', 'powers', 'multiply', 'concept', 'horrible', 'Who', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'evil', 'thing', 'Pokemon', 'world', 'where', 'Pokemon', 'are', 'loved', 'respected', 'Marauder', 'Celebi', 'forest', 'evil', 'arachnoid', 'droid', 'robot', 'machine', '4Ever', 'also', 'legendary', 'Pokemon', 'beautiful', 'noble', 'Suicune', 'better', 'name', 'folks', 'Pokemon', 'part', 'American', 'entertainment', 'now', 'important', 'remember', 'was', 'originally', 'Japanese', 'cartoon', 'evident', 'gentle', 'themes', 'film', 'protecting', 'forest', 'spirits', 'forest', 'Japan', 'main', 'religion', 'Shinto', 'natural', 'world', 'full', 'benevolent', 'spirits', 'must', 'honor', 'care', 'for.This', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'special', 'features', 'short', 'called', 'Pikachu', 'Pikabu', 'fun', 'kids', 'mind-numbing', 'adults', 'trivia', 'game', 'clips', 'film', 'question', 'answered', 'American', 'Japanese', 'trailers', 'film', 'are', 'included', 'Japanese', 'one', 'fun', 'watch', 'show', 'voice', 'actors', 'recording', 'obvious', 'are', 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Japanese', 'trailer', 'Pokemon', '5', 'sneak', 'peek', 'mentioned', 'not', 'English']",Pokemon 4Ever: Movie
