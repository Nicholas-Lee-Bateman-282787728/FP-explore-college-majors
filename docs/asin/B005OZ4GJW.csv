Can't believe it's been 40 years on, and the lads are still going strong. Beautiful picture quality, superb sound quality, masterfully edited, us old timers can't keep up with the fast editting like some of these other concert releases (like the newest Halford live in Japan). The boys are still at the top of their game, especially Gillan, still sounds good, Paice never hits a wrong note, Glover spot on, and Airey was born for the gig.  Steve Morse still shreds away, and as far as looks go, he looks like the oldest of the bunch now, but is easily 10 years younger than the rest of the fellas.  The orchestra sounds fresh, and doesn't overpower the band or the music.  Really a nice compliment. A natural setting.

1496955,AFSBKKDFLZZX5,B005OZ4GJW,Mark Anderson,"[2, 2]","I saw Deep Purple in concert in Victoria, B.C. during their 2012 Canadian tour. It was a great show. Ian Gillan, Roger Glover and Ian Paice are well into their 60s but they can still put a high energy performance. Steve Morse and Don Airey are fine replacements for Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord.After seeing Deep Purple's cuurent live act, I bought the Montreaux 2006 DVD, which is excellent. I wasn't sure about this one; I hesitated on buying this because I thought the orchestra might not be compatible with Deep Purple's music.I took a chance on this one anyway and I'm glad I did. It's an excellent performance. The orchestra brings a very real energy to the music. The sound is good and, for the most part, the camera work and editing are well done.I started listening to Deep Purple about 1971-72. At that time Deep Purple had already done one album with an orchestra - Jon Lord's Concerto for Group and Orchestra. That was more of a concept album; I never thought they'd do another one. If someone back then had predicted that in forty years Deep Purple would be performing classic tracks like Space Trucking, Lazy and Smoke On The Water with an orchestra backing them, I would have thought that person was insane.If you're hesitating about buying this because you not sure about Deep Purple playing with an orchestra backing them, stop hesitating and buy it. If you're a Deep Purple fan, you'll like this one.

1496956,A2Y5OSMCM4XX9N,B005OZ4GJW,"Metaljim ""Jim C.""","[4, 5]","Deep Purple has one of the finest catalogs in rock history, with a string of landmark albums stretching back to 1968. Their video history is a little dodgy in comparison. Since 1996 and the entrance of guitar whiz Steve Morse, the band have released numerous concert videos. Usually well shot and well recorded, the videos regularly fall flat on two fronts. First off, despite the string of albums mentioned earlier, the concert videos ALWAYS feature the same core set of songs and rarely spotlight newer material. Look at their DVD's for sale here on Amazon and check out the setlist of each. You'll find they're essentially the same setlist, with maybe three or four different songs added to this DVD or that other one. DP have released four albums (to date) with Steve Morse, yet they all get overlooked so they can regurgitate the same old MkII canon. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this band. I just get tired of that same old setlist. Secondly is vocalist Ian Gillan. Once one of the greatest voices in rock, but in his late 60's a pale shadow of former glories. Hey, we all get old and there's absolutely no shame in that. What I don't like is his repeated attempts to sing like he did at 20. Why is he still singing songs off of In Rock? Those notes are beyond his abilities these days, so why even try? It's difficult to watch and even painful at times. As far as this DVD goes, great video, great audio and nice camera work.

1496959,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B005OZ4GJW,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 3]","As a longtime Deep Purple fan, I was wondering what the current lineup would be like with an orchestra when I went to see them during this 2011 tour: I was fortunate enough to have front row seats between Ian and Steve in Minneapolis, and the set list was essentially identical to this DVD. The list of drawbacks here is brief: Ian Gillan's vocal range is definitely more limited than it was 40 years ago, but he still does a great job and can hit nearly all the notes except the highest of the highs; his performance is certainly spirited and I think he's better on the 2011 Montreux show DVD than on the recording from the 2006 show. Having said that, there's no other vocalist that would make this material sound better, and I am thrilled he and the band are still recording and touring.It turns out that I adore the band with the orchestra, and think that it adds amazingly to the depth of the performance. The arrangements were very smart with conductor Stephen Bentley-Klein providing perfect accents and accompaniment to these rock standards. Musicianship is first rate, with Don Airey doing well living in Lord's shadow, Ian Paice never missing a beat, Roger Glover being the consummate bassist, and Steve Morse providing his unique takes on the material and smoking through the set (I particularly loved the Billy Gibbons-inspired solo on ""Black Night,"" though I think ""Hush was better when I saw them in Minneapolis.) It's a given that the music is great (a particular highlight is ""No One Came"") but the DVD also has quite extended interviews that add considerable value for true fans. I was particularly intrigued by Paice's interview, especially his comments on ""No One Came"" (and his amusing comments about why he dislikes Facebook.)While some people harp on Gillan's diminished vocal abilities, I prefer to think of it from a ""glass half full"" perspective: he may not be able to do what he did on ""Machine Head,"" but most vocalists would still be envious of his considerable talents. As for the rest of the band, they have never sounded better. This is a great show, and the orchestra takes it to another level entirely. I recommend this DVD without reservation.",5,Deep Purple And An Orchestra?
