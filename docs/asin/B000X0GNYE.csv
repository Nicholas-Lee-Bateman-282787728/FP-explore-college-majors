I saw this film at a film festival in Boston and was really blown away. The true horific tale of what went on on the Island of Attu with our soldiers against Japan is important to know and learn from.  The film is historically important as well as heart felt.  We watch a man from that battle go back in today's time to visit the battle ground.  Really touching.  War sucks.  I wish all documentaries were this interesting!",5,I knew nothing about ATTU until I saw this documentary-wow,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,476,"['Red', 'White', 'Black', 'Blue', 'great', 'documentary', 'saw', 'film', 'film', 'festival', 'Boston', 'was', 'really', 'blown', 'away', 'true', 'horific', 'tale', 'what', 'went', 'Island', 'Attu', 'soldiers', 'Japan', 'important', 'know', 'learn', 'film', 'historically', 'important', 'as', 'well', 'heart', 'felt', 'watch', 'man', 'battle', 'go', 'back', 'today', 'time', 'visit', 'battle', 'ground', 'Really', 'touching', 'War', 'wish', 'documentaries', 'were', 'interesting']",Red White Black & Blue

It's America, thats why!The thing that bothered me the most were also the monuments erected by the japanese supposedly for the memory of all troops that died there but as you see the emotion in these mens faces when they see this monument they call it what it is.. A disgrace to americans, that the U.S would allow the Japanese to errect a monument on American soil for the memory of any Jap that died there is a slap in the face to all the U.S veterans that fought there..You also see the impact this has on them when they say they will lobby to have this monument removed.. The research I've dug up was that the motive behind it was the Japs that committed suicide on the island and to commemorate their own dead...This monument would not stand anywhere else in the country especially pearl so why, and please do not tell me it is because it is so remote that nobody goes there but it is also insulting to some inuit who find it inappropriateOverall I found this documentary very enlightening, there is not much footage from WW2 on here mostly just two men remembering the past but it serves it's purpose very well in enlightening some people whom didn't even know what the aleutians were or that they were invaded resulting in a lot of american soldiers lives to take back what was ours... The Japanese were the most ruthless people in the world during the war, the atrocities committed by them were never equaled by anyone else...The treatment of people by the Japanese were horrifying even to the Nazis, more than once did germany even advise Japan to treat people more humanely, worrying that what they did to any non Japanese would result in grave international consequences..Finally, I find this film enjoyable but there was just something in the background that I didn't understand, there is almost no footage of the combat here which makes me research the real meaning of this film... I have many documentaries on this subject but this is the first with such a lack of historical footage,  yes you hear the men describing what happened but without the footage that should accompany much of this there is just passing footage of the alaskan landscape..I was thinking this was just about those men going back there for the first time since the war but through research I found out that one of the purposes of this film was TO REMOVE the japanese memorial there which many deem inappropriate...This is the meaning to the film so if you would like to see a more accurate depiction of this part of the war I recommend checking out the title (The Bloody Aleutians) which will give you a more in depth explanation on this with many many more original pics and footage...I gave this a four because of the emotion and feeling of the men who are showed in it but as a documentary piece on the Aleutians during WW2 it falls very short...Much of what happened in the Aleutians cannot be found here so if you are looking for more of a historic view on it you should pick up something with a lil more informationAs it stands, this cannot be considered a history on the battles in the Aleutians,  there is too little information",3,Very very serious in it's message to remove the monuments!!!,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,4735,"['First', 'be', 'prepared', 'documentary', 'hidden',

The story telling is vigorous and insightful. It is imaginative and affective and provides a fresh treatment to an experience and episode that called for being told by both the warriors who fought it and those who have walked the hallowed ground and felt the spirits from those bygone days. Clearly, it is an outstanding work - it is fully complimentary with all that was written in both the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Attu and through the decades since. Interestingly, the use of digital editing brings the battlefield itself back to life with extraordinary impact - resulting with a very different feel and look that has been seen in a wide range of other history programs. - Prof Michael Haller",5,"Red, White, Black & Blue",1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,835,"['Red', 'White', 'Black', 'Blue', 'inspiring', 'documentary', 'Battle', 'Attu', 'Aleutian', 'Campaign', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Alaska', 'story', 'telling', 'vigorous', 'insightful', 'imaginative', 'affective', 'fresh', 'treatment', 'experience', 'episode', 'called', 'being', 'told', 'warriors', 'who', 'fought', 'who', 'have', 'walked', 'hallowed', 'ground', 'felt', 'spirits', 'bygone', 'days', 'Clearly', 'outstanding', 'work', 'fully', 'complimentary', 'was', 'written', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'Battle', 'Attu', 'decades', 'Interestingly', 'use', 'digital', 'editing', 'battlefield', 'back', 'life', 'extraordinary', 'impact', 'resulting', 'very', 'different', 'feel', 'look', 'been', 'seen', 'wide', 'range', 'other', 'history', 'programs', 'Prof', 'Michael', 'Haller']",Red White Black & Blue
