I think many audience members in 1947 would have related to Deborah Kerr's character's fear of making a mistake.  The storytelling in this movie is so strong that when Clark Gable propositions Kerr and then subtly adjusts to Kerr's practiced socially acceptable reproach that the audience can sense the conflict and the repression of Kerr's character.  The facts of life are what they are and mutual desire, shrewdness and social calibration are all here in this story.  It's very good but I think we can all breathe a sigh of relief that it is easier to raise our daughters and keep them safer now that we are more open and honest.",5,Before Birth Control,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,779,"['Birth', 'Control', 'think', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'yes', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'wonderfully', 'honest', 'girl', 'movie', 'think', 'many', 'audience', 'members', '1947', 'would', 'have', 'related', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'character', 'fear', 'making', 'mistake', 'storytelling', 'movie', 'so', 'strong', 'when', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'propositions', 'Kerr', 'then', 'subtly', 'Kerr', 'practiced', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'reproach', 'audience', 'can', 'sense', 'conflict', 'repression', 'Kerr', 'character', 'facts', 'life', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'mutual', 'desire', 'shrewdness', 'social', 'calibration', 'are', 'here', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'think', 'can', 'all', 'breathe', 'sigh', 'relief', 'easier', 'raise', 'daughters', 'keep', 'safer', 'now', 'are', 'more', 'open', 'honest']",Hucksters VHS

You find yourself cringing with them, recognizing the same bullheaded, contemptuous philosophy in today's marketing.

280033,AD2BIAIH78QI5,6301968972,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[15, 15]","The summation of ad man Clark Gable's reading of the riot act to soap magnate Sydney Greenstreet is just great in this a-one movie about the post-war radio advertising world. Gable has just hung up his uniform--literally--when the show begins, and is ready to resume his radio ad man career. Along the way, he has to tangle with Greenstreet, a really dopey Keenan Wynn, and decide which of two lovely ladies he wants to pursue. Quite a dilemma: the upper-crust war widow Deborah Kerr who seems like she'd be made of ice but is surprisingly warm to the touch, or sultry torch singer Ava Gardner, who might seem like a live wire but secretly yearns for an apron and a man in slippers.  For those who are as confused as Gable as regards the woman issue, have no fear--just check out &quot;Mogambo&quot; where once again Gable has to choose between a lady (this time, Grace Kelly) and a, well, not so much of a lady (Gardner again). See both movies together, and you can play out both scenarios.Really wonderful supporting work by Greenstreet as the overbearing soap dictator, used to making everyone alternately jump and grovel, and by Adolphe Menjou as the beleagured head of the ad agency, who has lost so many of his scruples that he embarrasses his wife in a terribly effective drunk scene in a nightclub double date with Gable/Kerr. Smaller role for veteran Edward Arnold, but just as solid as usual, playing a man who trusts Gable a little more than he ought.If you're in the mood for great post-war King Gable and a bevy of top-rate supporting players, make a bee line for &quot;The Hucksters&quot;--and that's no soft soap.",5,"&quot;And Mr. Evans, Your Ad is Not Clean.&quot;",1008806400,"12 20, 2001",2001,1628,"['summation', 'ad', 'man', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'reading', 'riot', 'act', 'soap', 'magnate', 'Sydney', 'Greenstreet', 'just', 'great', 'a-one', 'movie', 'post-war', 'radio', 'advertising', 'world', 'Gable', 'just', 'hung', 'up', 'uniform', 'literally', 'when', 'show', 'ready', 'resume', 'radio', 'ad', 'man', 'career', 'way', 'tangle', 'Greenstreet', 'really', 'dopey', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'decide', 'two', 'lovely', 'ladies', 'pursue', 'dilemma', 'upper-crust', 'war', 'widow', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'made', 'ice', 'surprisingly', 'warm', 'touch', 'sultry', 'torch', 'singer', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'who', 'might', 'seem', 'live', 'wire', 'secretly', 'yearns', 'apron', 'man', 'slippers', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'confused', 'as', 'Gable', 'regards', 'woman', 'issue', 'have', 'fear', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'quot', 'Mogambo', 'quot', 'where', 'once', 'again', 'Gable', 'choose', 'lady', 'time', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'lady', 'Gardner', 'again', 'See', 'movies', 'together', 'can', 'play', 'out', 'scenarios.Really', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'work', 'Greenstreet', 'overbearing', 'soap', 'dictator', 'used', 'making', 'everyone', 'alternately', 'jump', 'grovel', 'Adolphe', 'Menjou', 'beleagured', 'head', 'ad', 'agency', 'who', 'lost', 'so', 'many', 'scruples', 'wife', 'terribly', 'effective', 'drunk', 'scene', 'nightclub', 'double', 'date', 'Gable/Kerr', 'Smaller', 'role', 'veteran', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'just', 'as', 'solid', 'usual', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'Gable', 'little', 'more', ""'re"", 'mood', 'great', 'post-war', 'King', 'Gable', 'bevy', 'top-rate', 'supporting', 'players', 'make', 'bee', 'line', 'quot', 'Hucksters', 'quot', 'soft', 'soap']",Hucksters VHS

The story is about Victor Norman (Clark Gable); a war veteran joins an advertising company as their top-notch marketing specialist. In the first assignment, he recruits a war widow, Kay Dorrance (Deborah Kerr) to do a commercial for soap product. This engagement brings into direct conflict with a demanding and autocratic client Evan Llewellyn Evans (Sydney Greenstreet), the owner of the soap manufacturing company. This is a drama of a young marketing recruit battling the giant of the industry to prove a point that money can't buy him.Deborah Kerr looks absolutely ravishing and Ava Gardner plays a young woman named Jean Ogilvie who is attracted to Victor but saddened to know that his interest is focused on Kay. Director Jack Conway is a master of making drama movies, and he has directed some of the best that includes; Saratoga, A Yank at Oxford, The Gay Bride, Libeled Lady, The girl from Missouri, The red headed woman, Too hot to handle, A star is born, and A tale of the two cities. He worked with Clark Gable and other major stars of the golden era and he is at ease in working with such monumental figures of that time.

After WW11,many returning servicemen came home looking for work.Selling household goods, small enough to be carried in a suitcase,door to door,to housewives,was a common reality in the late 40's and 50's. In Australia many homes and businesses soon started putting ""No Hawkers or Canvassers"" signs in their front windows in an effort to dissuade would-be salesmen.Clark Gable stars as a returned serviceman who gets a job in advertising, whereby the account they are desperate to win is with a company that makes soap,and has it's own radio station. The campaign is worth a lot of money and the Company CEO, a very unpleasant fellow called Evan Evans (Sydney Greenstreet) uses tyrannical means to goad his team into action and get that account at all costs.Gable meets a war widow (Deborah Kerr) and her two children,and she agrees to be the girl in his soap ad. He soon realises his new lady is all good taste and class and fashions the advertisement to emphasize this - no sheer under wear for her !There is an unforgettable act committed by Evans in his Boardroom. Quite revolting and shocking. Equally,very effective.Gable realises he can no longer work for this ogre of a man, even though he needs the income the job supplies, as he wants to marry Kaye (Deborah Kerr) and be a father to her children.This is a good film with a fine caste, headed by the man once known as the King of Hollywood - Clark Gable, ably supported by the great Deborah Kerr in her first American role, and Sidney Greenstreet as the revolting lounge lizard, Evan Evans, and the sultry Ava Gardner,plus Keenan Wynn and Edward Arnold.

280041,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,6301968972,Susan Fong,"[37, 37]","""The Hucksters"" is a refreshingly adult drama with themes that resonate even today.  Clark Gable plays an advertising agent (a ""huckster"") who is basically a decent man, but who finds himself increasingly compromising his principles in order to satisfy a despotic soap magnate played by Sydney Greenstreet, who obviously relishes in playing such a despicable, larger than life character.As part of a promotion for his client's product, Gable convinces a lovely society war widow (sensitively played by Deborah Kerr) to endorse Greenstreet's beauty soap.  Gable is immediately attracted to Kerr and vice versa.But Gable and Kerr's characters are polar opposites.  He is a driven sometimes ruthlessly ambitious businessman.  She is a very proper, rather sheltered, but highly moral mother of two small children and a widow of a war hero.In 1947, the year of this film's release, there was still a strong sense of morality in movies (something absent in most of today's films).  The idea of having sex outside of marriage was not considered lightly.  And in ""The Hucksters"", this issue is tastefully dealt with minus the vulgarity and gratuitous sexuality that permeate most of today's films. (Call me old fashioned, but I think we could do without so many explicit sex scenes in movies today.)There are other contemporary topics in this film such as the power of big business to control the media and the dilemma of ""getting ahead"" in your profession by any means, ethical or not.Even though this movie is over 50 years old, it holds up extremely well.  It makes for an absorbing two hours of entertainment.",5,Absorbing drama,1028073600,"07 31, 2002",2002,1605,"['Hucksters', 'refreshingly', 'adult', 'drama', 'themes', 'resonate', 'even', 'today', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'advertising', 'agent', 'huckster', 'who', 'basically', 'decent', 'man', 'who', 'increasingly', 'compromising', 'principles', 'order', 'satisfy', 'despotic', 'soap', 'magnate', 'played', 'Sydney', 'Greenstreet', 'who', 'obviously', 'playing', 'despicable', 'larger', 'life', 'character.As', 'part', 'promotion', 'client', 'product', 'Gable', 'convinces', 'lovely', 'society', 'war', 'widow', 'sensitively', 'played', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'endorse', 'Greenstreet', 'beauty', 'soap', 'Gable', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'Kerr', 'vice', 'versa.But', 'Gable', 'Kerr', 'characters', 'are', 'polar', 'opposites', 'driven', 'sometimes', 'ruthlessly', 'ambitious', 'businessman', 'very', 'proper', 'rather', 'sheltered', 'highly', 'moral', 'mother', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'widow', 'war', 'hero.In', '1947', 'year', 'film', 'release', 'was', 'still', 'strong', 'sense', 'morality', 'movies', 'something', 'absent', 'most', 'today', 'films', 'idea', 'having', 'sex', 'marriage', 'was', 'not', 'considered', 'lightly', 'Hucksters', 'issue', 'tastefully', 'dealt', 'vulgarity', 'gratuitous', 'sexuality', 'permeate', 'most', 'today', 'films', 'Call', 'old', 'fashioned', 'think', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'other', 'contemporary', 'topics', 'film', 'such', 'power', 'big', 'business', 'control', 'media', 'dilemma', 'getting', 'ahead', 'profession', 'means', 'ethical', 'not.Even', 'movie', '50', 'years', 'old', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'absorbing', 'two', 'hours', 'entertainment']",Hucksters VHS
