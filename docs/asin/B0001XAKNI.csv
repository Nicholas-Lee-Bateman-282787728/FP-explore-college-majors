The Rosenblads are your typical american couple, except for the fact that they're a pair of serial-killing cannibals. It's great that they share a common interest, but alas, this doesn't stop them from quarreling over the little annoyances in life. Anyone who is married can attest to the fact that the things we found endearing or ""cute"" about our partners in the beginning, tend to become very old in the long run. It's no different for the Rosenblads. They fight over the silliest stuff, like who killed who and what victim would best augment the main course. The poor Rosenblads allow the very murderous pathologies that drew them together to come between them, with disastrous results. Oh yeah, they have a young daughter too. She is much loved by her maniacal parents (in a sociopathic sort of way), but she's also in a lot of danger! Can this little family survive their deadly dysfunction?

From the trailer I expected this movie to be a dark spoof of romantic comedies that your girlfriends usually drags you in to watch. I was wrong. The movie has an ultra serious tone. There is some humor now and again but this mostly domestic disturbances to the nth degree. It's a bit of a social statement abou the stresses of marriage and the power struggle between man and wife. The ending is predictable but still leaves you guessing. There are some twists that are revealed during the climax.

These two have flashbacks which are pretty uninteresting as they try to figure out where their marriage went bad.

815971,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B0001XAKNI,Michael R Gates,"[3, 6]","In spite of the title, indie director Jon Keeyes' direct-to-video horror opus SUBURBAN NIGHTMARE (2004) is not a sequel to his lesser 2002 splatter flick AMERICAN NIGHTMARE.  Instead, SUBURBAN NIGHTMARE is actually a witty, well-written dark satire that takes some pokes at modern matrimony in middle-class America.The film follows a day in the lives of Charles Rosenblad (Trent Haaga) and his pretty wife Deborah (Brandy Little).  The Rosenblads seem to love each other, but as with most suburban American couples, they nonetheless squabble over the little differences of opinion that crop up during the course of any normal long-term relationship.  But unlike other young marrieds, the Rosenblads' little spats don't revolve around what color to paint the livingroom, where to eat out, or the like.  No, the Rosenblads argue about who gets to kill their next dinner guests or which victim would taste best in tonight's spaghetti.  The Rosenblads are serial killers, you see, and their marriage is based on the credo that the family that slays together stays together.Writer/Director Keeyes generates an unnerving satirical humor in SUBURBAN NIGHTMARE by juxtaposing everyday domestic strife with sadism, violence, and murder.  Mature audience members quickly identify with the film's characters because they've all experienced dinner-table arguements such as the Rosenblads are having.  But the Rosenblads' nonchalance towards the state of their dinner guests--both of whom are slumped over dead, their heads face-down in the main course--forces viewers to contemplate everyday domestic quarrels from a new perspective and, in turn, spurs the realization of how trivial such things really are in the overall scheme of life.The direction and camera work in the film are superb.  Most of the action takes place inside a relatively small suburban house, and this creates for the viewer a sense of confinement or constriction that only adds to the uneasy juxtaposition of the domestic and the horrifying.  There is also skillful use of the split-diopter lens, a device that allows two objects that are in different focal planes, relative to the camera, to both be in perfect focus.  At various points during the Rosenblads' feature-length argument, the special lens is used to allow one character to be very close to the camera while, at the same time, the other is some distance away in either an adjoining room or a far corner of the same room.  This subtle visual trick creates a surreal sense of space that adds to the audience's perception that there is a widening disparity between Charles and Deborah.The acting in the film is top-notch.  Genre fans and connoisseurs of outrageous films will recognize Trent Haaga from the many flicks he's done for Troma, the studio that has mastered the art of low-budget tastelessness.  Troma's cinematic standards often require Haaga to take his performances way over the top, but his performance in SUBURBAN NIGHTMARE is both sympathetic and believable.  And in contrast to several of her other genre films, the attractive Brandy Little is more than mere eye candy here.  As Deborah Rosenblad, Little proves her wide and flexible range as she convincingly runs the gamut of human emotions from innocent love through raging hate.Interesting music also punctuates the violence and domestic strife depicted in SUBURBAN NIGHTMARE.  As he did for his film AMERICAN NIGHTMARE, Keeyes utilzes the intrinsic creepy, spooky, and sometimes frightening quality of the Industrial, Goth, and Psychobilly (aka, Gothabilly) music genres to enhance the ambiance of his flick.  One of the especially notable uses of such music in SUBURBAN NIGHTMARE is a ditty by the Psychobilly band Ghoultown that plays over the film's closing credits.  The name of the song is ""Killin's a Bitch (And This Bitch Is Killin' Me),"" and the lyrics so perfectly suit the subject matter of the film that the song functions as the ultimate auditory exclamation point.The DVD edition of SUBURBAN NIGHTMARE from Ventura Distribution is well worth the reasonable price of admission.  It presents the movie in anamorphic widescreen at the original ratio of 1.85:1, and the transfer is remarkably clear (not surprising, really, considering it was shot in HDTV video using a Panasonic HDTV camera).  And the disc is chockfull of cool extras, including a feature commentary with the director and film editor Robert McCollum; several behind-the-scenes and making-of featurettes; three excellent horror shorts from young filmmakers; and several Shock-o-Rama trailers.  A worthy addition to the collection of any horror fan.",4,When Serial Killers Fall Out of Love...,1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,4618,"['spite', 'title', 'indie', 'director', 'Jon', 'Keeyes', 'direct-to-video', 'horror', 'opus', 'SUBURBAN', 'NIGHTMARE', '2004', 'not', 'sequel', 'lesser', '2002', 'splatter', 'flick', 'AMERICAN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'Instead', 'SUBURBAN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'actually', 'witty', 'well-written', 'dark', 'satire', 'pokes', 'modern', 'matrimony', 'middle-class', 'America.The', 'film', 'day', 'lives', 'Charles', 'Rosenblad', 'Trent', 'Haaga', 'pretty', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Brandy', 'Little', 'Rosenblads', 'seem', 'love', 'other', 'most', 'suburban', 'American', 'couples', 'nonetheless', 'squabble', 'over', 'little', 'differences', 'opinion', 'crop', 'up', 'course', 'normal', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'other', 'young', 'marrieds', 'Rosenblads', 'little', 'spats', 'do', ""n't"", 'revolve', 'around', 'what', 'color', 'paint', 'livingroom', 'where', 'eat', 'out', 'like', 'No', 'Rosenblads', 'argue', 'who', 'kill', 'next', 'dinner', 'guests', 'victim', 'would', 'taste', 'best', 'tonight', 'spaghetti', 'Rosenblads', 'are', 'serial', 'killers', 'see', 'marriage', 'based', 'credo', 'family', 'together', 'stays', 'together.Writer/Director', 'Keeyes', 'unnerving', 'satirical', 'humor', 'SUBURBAN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'juxtaposing', 'everyday', 'domestic', 'strife', 'sadism', 'violence', 'murder', 'Mature', 'audience', 'members', 'quickly', 'identify', 'film', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'dinner-table', 'arguements', 'such', 'Rosenblads', 'are', 'having', 'Rosenblads', 'nonchalance', 'state', 'dinner', 'guests', 'whom', 'are', 'slumped', 'dead', 'heads', 'face-down', 'main', 'course', 'viewers', 'contemplate', 'everyday', 'domestic', 'quarrels', 'new', 'perspective', 'turn', 'realization', 'how', 'trivial', 'such', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'overall', 'scheme', 'life.The', 'direction', 'camera', 'work', 'film', 'are', 'superb', 'Most', 'action', 'place', 'relatively', 'small', 'suburban', 'house', 'viewer', 'sense', 'confinement', 'constriction', 'only', 'uneasy', 'juxtaposition', 'domestic', 'horrifying', 'also', 'skillful', 'use', 'split-diopter', 'lens', 'device', 'two', 'objects', 'are', 'different', 'focal', 'planes', 'relative', 'camera', 'be', 'perfect', 'focus', 'various', 'points', 'Rosenblads', 'feature-length', 'argument', 'special', 'lens', 'used', 'allow', 'one', 'character', 'be', 'very', 'close', 'camera', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'distance', 'away', 'adjoining', 'room', 'far', 'corner', 'same', 'room', 'subtle', 'visual', 'trick', 'surreal', 'sense', 'space', 'audience', 'perception', 'widening', 'disparity', 'Charles', 'Deborah.The', 'acting', 'film', 'top-notch', 'Genre', 'fans', 'connoisseurs', 'outrageous', 'films', 'will', 'recognize', 'Trent', 'Haaga', 'many', 'flicks', 'done', 'Troma', 'studio', 'mastered', 'art', 'low-budget', 'tastelessness', 'Troma', 'cinematic', 'standards', 'often', 'require', 'Haaga', 'take', 'performances', 'way', 'top', 'performance', 'SUBURBAN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'sympathetic', 'believable', 'contrast', 'several', 'other', 'genre', 'films', 'attractive', 'Brandy', 'Little', 'more', 'mere', 'eye', 'candy', 'here', 'Deborah', 'Rosenblad', 'Little', 'wide', 'flexible', 'range', 'convincingly', 'gamut', 'human', 'emotions', 'innocent', 'love', 'raging', 'hate.Interesting', 'music', 'also', 'violence', 'domestic', 'strife', 'depicted', 'SUBURBAN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'did', 'film', 'AMERICAN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'Keeyes', 'intrinsic', 'creepy', 'spooky', 'sometimes', 'frightening', 'quality', 'Industrial', 'Goth', 'Psychobilly', 'aka', 'Gothabilly', 'music', 'genres', 'enhance', 'ambiance', 'flick', 'One', 'especially', 'notable', 'uses', 'such', 'music', 'SUBURBAN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'ditty', 'Psychobilly', 'band', 'Ghoultown', 'film', 'closing', 'credits', 'name', 'song', 'Killin', 'Bitch', 'Bitch', 'Is', 'Killin', 'Me', 'lyrics', 'so', 'perfectly', 'suit', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'song', 'functions', 'ultimate', 'auditory', 'exclamation', 'point.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'SUBURBAN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'Ventura', 'Distribution', 'well', 'worth', 'reasonable', 'price', 'admission', 'movie', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'original', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'transfer', 'remarkably', 'clear', 'not', 'surprising', 'really', 'considering', 'was', 'shot', 'HDTV', 'video', 'using', 'Panasonic', 'HDTV', 'camera', 'disc', 'chockfull', 'cool', 'extras', 'including', 'feature', 'commentary', 'director', 'film', 'editor', 'Robert', 'McCollum', 'several', 'behind-the-scenes', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'three', 'excellent', 'horror', 'shorts', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'several', 'Shock-o-Rama', 'trailers', 'worthy', 'addition', 'collection', 'horror', 'fan']",N/A

Since most of the action in this movie involves the husbund and wife stabbing, shooting, and otherwise trying to destroy each other, I was disappointed with the it.

To keep her from being able to esacpe the pain by passing out, he injects her with amphethemine before putting the iron on her....I realize the character of the daughter was in the movie the add depth to the characters, but it seemed like the writters didn't really know what to do with her.

815975,A16CB9KZ8OER76,B0001XAKNI,WLR,"[0, 1]","Congratulations to the Shock o Rama Cinema production company!  Suburban Nightmare is an example of independent cinema at its most effective.  It is a very low budget, straight to video effort, that was obviously shot in and around somebody's house, yet achieves a lot.  It is admittedly an art movie intended for a niche audience, yet the dialogue, story, and acting are arguably better than your typical Hollywood offering.  The story describes one long evening in the life of a thirtyish white middle class suburban couple.  The wife is a recovering alcoholic who has been on the wagon for over a year since she was involved in a very serious auto accident while driving drunk and which resulted in serious injury to their approximately 10 year old daughter.  She very much wants to have another child but the husband isn't too keen on the idea.  They argue and fight about this constantly.  Their lives are greatly complicated by the fact that they are also thrill killers and ghoulish gourmets who have become accustomed to getting their jollies by murdering people and then occasionally using some select parts of their victims as ingredients in their cuisine.  It isn't as corny as that sounds.  This movie is a lot like the 70s cult movie Eating Raoul, for those of you who are familiar with it, except that I think that this one is much better.  The wife also has strong lesbian tendencies and they have a terrified captive teenage girl which they keep chained nearly naked in the basement that the wife often torments when she is angry.  While reasonably attractive, the couple is pretty ordinary.  The husband is kind of small and scrawny while the wife is a robust tomboy, so that they are pretty evenly matched physically.  This comes into play when their fighting becomes more physical.  The action is non-stop like a play and the dialogue is incredibly real.
