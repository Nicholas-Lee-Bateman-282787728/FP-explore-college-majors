Judging by the reception it received in theaters across America upon its '89 release and again by the numerous negative reviews here on Amazon.com the answer appears to be you don't.I guess I'll have to disagree with the majority consensus. In my opinion director Philipe Mora has done an admirable job in visualizing Mr. Streiber's disquieting, otherwordly visions, providing us with a disturbing glimpse into the world of UFO's and their occupants.Much of the disappointment and animosity expressed towards this film is due to the ambigious nature of the UFO phenomenon and the directors insistence on leaving it that way. To try and pin down or label psychic experiences is to lose forever the essence of these primal encounters.

If you are looking for a straightforward movie like Close Encounters or the like, you will probably not enjoy it as much.  I think what the director of Communion is trying to say to the viewer, is YOU decide whether what you are watching is reality or fantasy.  He is not trying to tell you aliens or real, nor is he saying they are NOT real.  Likewise, the main character does not seem sure that what he is experiencing is real or not, and by showing the aliens as being suspiciously fake-looking, and the dream-like interactions with them so completely bizarre, the director is trying to put you inside Whitley's head so to speak, and attempts to get the viewer to experience Whitley's feeling of disorientation, doubt and occasional terror.  In that regard, this movie works 100%.  Sadly some people will not pick up on the film's message and will just see a seemingly disorganized movie about some very dodgy looking aliens.",5,"Genuinely Creepy, and ingenious.",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,1004,"['enjoy', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'how', 'percieve', 'are', 'looking', 'straightforward', 'movie', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'like', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'think', 'what', 'director', 'Communion', 'trying', 'say', 'viewer', 'YOU', 'decide', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'not', 'trying', 'tell', 'aliens', 'real', 'saying', 'are', 'NOT', 'real', 'Likewise', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'seem', 'sure', 'what', 'experiencing', 'real', 'not', 'showing', 'aliens', 'being', 'suspiciously', 'fake-looking', 'dream-like', 'interactions', 'so', 'completely', 'bizarre', 'director', 'trying', 'put', 'Whitley', 'head', 'so', 'speak', 'attempts', 'get', 'viewer', 'experience', 'Whitley', 'feeling', 'disorientation', 'doubt', 'occasional', 'terror', 'regard', 'movie', '100', '%', 'Sadly', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'film', 'message', 'will', 'just', 'see', 'seemingly', 'disorganized', 'movie', 'very', 'dodgy', 'looking', 'aliens']",N/A

Christopher Walken does a good job here, though I've seen him do much better, but here he totally disappears in this character of Whitley Strieber. However, we are never quite clear of what the movie's intentions are. Is it a simple little creepy story? Or a serious dissection of the alien abduction phenomenon? I guess maybe it depends on your point of view on the subject. Which is, I guess, the same way people view the bestselling (non-fiction) book of the same name. I personally can say that I have never experienced some sort of UFO abduction and have my doubts on the existance of alien life, so I look at &quot;Communion&quot; from an outsider's view. For those of us who don't stay in the circle of UFO researchers or &quot;Experiencers,&quot; &quot;Communion&quot; works as a good try at scaring the viewer. There are some effective sequences, especially those that take place in the Striebers' cabin, where the abductions first took place. The scenes with the alien beings look really well-done and real. I don't call &quot;Communion&quot; science fiction because it is, like the book, being sold as a true story and there are people who believe it and who have reported claims in the same nature and no offense is wished, so, for me &quot;Communion&quot; comes off as a creepy drama. It isn't completely horrific, indeed, I wished for a few better scares. The reason the movie didn't work completely for me, was that at the end I was left confused and puzzled, &quot;Communion&quot; isn't very clear on what happened or how. It was reported that a film was being worked on based on Strieber's follow-up, &quot;Transformation,&quot; but it apparently never materialized, though I wished it had to shed some more light on the story. In fact, &quot;Communion&quot; is not clear when things ARE happening, not just when it shows flashbacks. Take the scene near the end when Walken apparently visits an alien vessel, I didn't understand zilch of what was going on in there and when Walken suddenly wakes up in his car, I was even more confused. Still, &quot;Communion&quot; isn't BAD, it works as an original story and as a showcasing of great performances through-out. UFO buffs will probably love it, outsiders like myself apparently need to not only read the book (which I haven't but now plan to) but watch the movie again after doing so. Not horrible, not terrible, not great, but entertaining and interesting.",3,"Well-Acted, Sometimes Effective, not bad.",996624000,"08 1, 2001",2001,2503,"['quot', 'Communion', 'quot', 'movie', 'well-acted', 'sometimes', 'effective', 'drama', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'good', 'job', 'here', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'here', 'totally', 'character', 'Whitley', 'Strieber', 'However', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'what', 'movie', 'intentions', 'are', 'simple', 'little', 'creepy', 'story', 'serious', 'dissection', 'alien', 'abduction', 'phenomenon', 'guess', 'maybe', 'point', 'view', 'subject', 'Which', 'guess', 'same', 'way', 'people', 'view', 'bestselling', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'personally', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'sort', 'UFO', 'abduction', 'have', 'doubts', 'existance', 'alien', 'life', 'look', 'quot', 'Communion', 'quot', 'outsider', 'view', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'circle', 'UFO', 'researchers', 'quot', 'Experiencers', 'quot', 'quot', 'Communion', 'quot', 'good', 'try', 'scaring', 'viewer', 'are', 'effective', 'sequences', 'especially', 'take', 'place', 'Striebers', 'cabin', 'where', 'abductions', 'first', 'took', 'place', 'scenes', 'alien', 'beings', 'look', 'really', 'well-done', 'real', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'quot', 'Communion', 'quot', 'science', 'fiction', 'book', 'being', 'sold', 'true', 'story', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'who', 'have', 'reported', 'claims', 'same', 'nature', 'offense', 'wished', 'so', 'quot', 'Communion', 'quot', 'off', 'creepy', 'drama', ""n't"", 'completely', 'horrific', 'indeed', 'wished', 'few', 'better', 'scares', 'reason', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'completely', 'was', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'confused', 'puzzled', 'quot', 'Communion', 'quot', ""n't"", 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'was', 'reported', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'worked', 'based', 'Strieber', 'follow-up', 'quot', 'Transformation', 'quot', 'apparently', 'never', 'materialized', 'wished', 'had', 'shed', 'more', 'light', 'story', 'fact', 'quot', 'Communion', 'quot', 'not', 'clear', 'when', 'things', 'ARE', 'happening', 'not', 'just', 'when', 'flashbacks', 'Take', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Walken', 'apparently', 'alien', 'vessel', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'zilch', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'when', 'Walken', 'suddenly', 'up', 'car', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'confused', 'Still', 'quot', 'Communion', 'quot', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'original', 'story', 'showcasing', 'great', 'performances', 'through-out', 'UFO', 'buffs', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'outsiders', 'apparently', 'need', 'not', 'only', 'read', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'now', 'plan', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'doing', 'so', 'Not', 'horrible', 'not', 'terrible', 'not', 'great', 'entertaining', 'interesting']",N/A

South American shamans and healers drink this in the form of a brew called AYAHUASCA. Known celebrities such as Sting and Paul Simon have imbibed in this ceremonial hallucinogen. Some, but not all, of the people who have ingested this chemical report very real experiences of fairies, elves and alien entities who often probe, work, and sometimes heal the participant. The theory is that the glands of people who experience alien abduction, are overproducing the chemical DMT. However, almost all of these participants believe that they were experiencing these alien entities and probes in a VERY REAL hyper-dimension that co-exists side by side with ours. AND that these entities are REAL. Which makes this film all the more intriguing!!Is Whitley Strieber hallucinating or is he really tapping into another dimension?

515450,ALCH4E3ECPGX0,B00002VW3I,"""walkencomputerfund""","[1, 3]","Let me begin this review by stating that I am a huge fan of Christopher Walken. OK, I'm done. Do yourself a huge favor and buy the VHS version of this movie. The director's cut is so bad in places it's cathartic. At the very least, it's enough to make you want to wash your brain out with soap, and Walken's as well.I bought this because it is supposed to be one of Walken's finest works, and it truly is. He is such a sensitive, honest actor that even the most miserable script flows like water across his performances. I think he's a national treasure, and like national treasures, subject to horrific abuse. This movie unequivocally abuses Christopher Walken, and lends credence to the rumors that the actor suffered a breakdown of sorts in his 40s. Just watch the out-takes of him cavorting in the most explicitly banal ways with plastic jumpy things that vaguely resemble a very bad joke by Arthur C. Clarke.ONCE you climb back down from the walls, and IF this DVD survives a well deserved fling across the room and a naughty chuckle, you may want to watch it again. This is not a joke. You spent money on this DVD, you deserve to get something out of it. IF you discount the whole alien nonsense, and view it from the perspective of a man coming to grips with a disintegrating mind, complete with cheesy special effects (as most maudlin breakdowns entail), it really is quite good. Toss Whitley Streiber, his wife and kid, WATCH Walken as he rationalizes all this bizarre information in his intensely personal performance, which is extraordinary. Read your own meaning into it, achieve what you want, and see a truly gifted actor dance perilously close to the edge of madness.",3,Walken through the Alien Sunset,977961600,"12 28, 2000",2000,1682,"['Let', 'begin', 'review', 'stating', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'OK', ""'m"", 'done', 'Do', 'huge', 'favor', 'buy', 'VHS', 'version', 'movie', 'director', 'cut', 'so', 'bad', 'places', 'cathartic', 'very', 'least', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'wash', 'brain', 'soap', 'Walken', 'well.I', 'bought', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'Walken', 'finest', 'works', 'truly', 'such', 'sensitive', 'honest', 'actor', 'even', 'most', 'miserable', 'script', 'flows', 'water', 'performances', 'think', 'national', 'treasure', 'national', 'treasures', 'subject', 'horrific', 'abuse', 'movie', 'unequivocally', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'credence', 'rumors', 'actor', 'suffered', 'breakdown', 'sorts', '40s', 'Just', 'watch', 'out-takes', 'cavorting', 'most', 'explicitly', 'banal', 'ways', 'plastic', 'jumpy', 'things', 'vaguely', 'resemble', 'very', 'bad', 'joke', 'Arthur', 'C.', 'Clarke.ONCE', 'climb', 'back', 'down', 'walls', 'IF', 'DVD', 'well', 'deserved', 'fling', 'room', 'naughty', 'chuckle', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'not', 'joke', 'spent', 'money', 'DVD', 'deserve', 'get', 'something', 'IF', 'discount', 'whole', 'alien', 'nonsense', 'view', 'perspective', 'man', 'coming', 'grips', 'disintegrating', 'mind', 'complete', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'most', 'maudlin', 'breakdowns', 'entail', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'Toss', 'Whitley', 'Streiber', 'wife', 'kid', 'WATCH', 'Walken', 'bizarre', 'information', 'intensely', 'personal', 'performance', 'extraordinary', 'Read', 'own', 'meaning', 'achieve', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'truly', 'gifted', 'actor', 'dance', 'perilously', 'close', 'edge', 'madness']",N/A
