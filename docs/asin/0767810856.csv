10177,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0767810856,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[13, 15]","""It Could Happen to You"" was the surprise romantic comedy of the Summer of 1994 directed by Andrew Bergman (screenwriter for ""The Freshman"", ""Fletch"", ""Striptease"" and director of ""Honeymoon in Vegas"") and a screenplay by Jane Anderson (who has written for television series such as ""The Facts of Life"", ""The Wonder Years"" and most recently an episode of ""Mad Men"").VIDEO & AUDIO:One thing that people may see is the Blu-ray disc cover with photos that looks quite grainy and aged.  Granted it was an artistic decision to use a water color style of filter to give a painted look but by no means should anyone judge the cover for the picture and audio quality of this High Definition transfer of ""It Could Happen to You"".The film is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1.  Although, the film does show a slight hint of age and the High Definition transfer does bring out the grain, you do get a bright and colorful look of New York City and overall, picture quality is well-done for a film that is 15-years-old compared to the original DVD.  Like many films that came out in the 90's, many on Blu-ray tend to have some softness or dullness and ""It Could Happen to You"" joins that group.To tell you the truth, ""It Could Happen to You"" is not a stellar transfer but its a very good transfer compared to the DVD.The audio quality is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 in English, French and Portuguese and in Spanish 5.1.  The film is primarily a dialogue driven film.  Definitely more front channel speaker usage and rarely a need for the rear speakers or subwoofer in this film.  Dialogue is heard clearly and I think that once in awhile, you do hear the sounds of New York and the ambiance but overall, audio quality is very good for a dialogue-driven film.Music also plays a big part in giving us that New York feel but also that romantic sense with Frank Sinatra's ""Young at Heart"" playing during a scene at the old Yankee Stadium and of course beautiful classics such as Billie Holiday's ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"", ""Now It Can Be Told"" and ""Always"" by Tony Bennett and more.Subtitles featured are in English, English SDH, Portuguese, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:Unfortunately, there are no special features included. The Blu-ray disc for ""It Could Happen to You"" is BD LIVE enabled.JUDGMENT CALL:""It Could Happen to You"" is a romantic comedy that was in theaters in July 1994.  The screenplay fits the ""fairytale"" or ""Happy Ever After"" storylines that were popping up in the early 90's courtesy of films such as ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"".The film was an enjoyable romantic comedy that definitely had that Frank Capra style of being a ""happily ever after"" storyline.Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda definitely were enjoyable to watch, while Rosie Perez's character really goes out of its way to make you really despise her.  With ""Pretty Woman"" about rags-to-riches, ""It Could Happen to You"" goes a different way of money changing things but its all about how one responds to it.  Charlie and Yvonne continue to want to live their simple lives, he as a cop and she as a waitress.  Both have extremely kind and caring hearts while Muriel wants the best in life...the expensive clothes, plastic surgery and whatever fame it could bring her.  A selfish attitude that helps drive the final wedge into her marriage with Charlie.With Andrew Bergman in the helm as director, some may have wondered if the film would have been dark since his previous film such as ""The Freshman"" and ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" were anywhere near happy as this film but overall, Bergman did a good job capturing that New York magic and the emotions of the characters.  While Jane Anderson did a good job in making sure the pacing was just right and giving us that ""happily ever after"", ""feel good"" type of film.  In other words, the Bergman, Anderson and the entire film play it safe and never gets complicated.Of course, the storyline of a police officer willing to share half his multi-million dollar winnings with a waitress may seem farfetched but according to snopes.com, a similar story really did happen for real in 1984 with NYPD officer Robert Cunningham and Sal's Pizzeria waitress Phyllis Penzo.It's the performances by all three talents that make this film so magical, believable and most of all enjoyable.  And I like how the film would showcase the New York atmosphere from the city skyline to Yankee stadium.Overall, ""It Could Happen to You"" is an enjoyable romantic comedy that even in 15-years-later, is given new life through it's new, beautiful Blu-ray transfer.  This is probably the best we will ever see this film get.If there was only one negative that I found with this release is the lack of any trailer, featurette, commentary or anything that would be considered a special feature.  You do get trailers for upcoming films but that's about it.All in all, ""It Could Happen to You"" is an enjoyable romantic comedy worth checking out!",3,"Blu-ray:  The film deserves 4 stars, but the presentation on Blu-ray and lack of features brings it down to 3 stars.",1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,4981,"['Could', 'Happen', 'was', 'surprise', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Summer', '1994', 'directed',

Set (and filmed) in New York and based loosely on a true story, Nicholas Cage plays the part of a cop who wins four million dollars in the lottery. Having already promised half his winnings to a waitress (played by Bridget Fonda) as a tip if he wins, he refuses to go back on his promise, much to the dismay of his greedy wife (Rosie Perez). Cage and Fonda soon fall in love, which results in Perez suing Cage for the entire $4 million.There's nothing profound about this movie and its plot is predictable.

Only Hollywood could come up with something like this. A NYC cop lacks enough money to tip a waitress, a total stranger, so he offers to split a freshly-purchased lottery ticket with her if he wins. She graciously agrees and they part. Well, folks, I bet you can't guess what happens. You're right, he wins 4 million dollars the next day. Then he's forced into telling his money-grubbing wife that he gave away half of the lottery winnings to a woman he doesn't even know and she doesn't even know who he is or that he won, but that they had agreed and it was a matter of honor that they split it. Did I mention that the waitress was married to a money-grubbing husband? Well, I'm sure you could have guessed by now. Sappy? Well, that's only the beginning. Then the financial vultures swirl in and by the time they're done neither the cop nor the waitress have anything but one another. Again, you probably guessed. But not all was lost, because of the generosity of the cop and the waitress, the wonderful people of NYC send them bundles of five and ten dollar donations to the point where they have over six hundred thousand dollars and they lived happily ever after, or something like that.So, what did I think of this wonderful uplifting fantasy movie? The cinema was okay. The acting was okay, but Cage looked embarrassed at his own efforts from time to time. It's hard to imagine any of the cast members taking the script seriously, yet it certainly wasn't a comedy.

The final intentions are precisely what it counts. A winning lottery ticket will become the sparkling breach to narrate a story that surely will enchant you.A marriage in disgrace due both of them would seem to talk by different TV channels. His marriage is far to be a dialogue, but an exchange of monologues. A honest man, a good guy, a candid man, is a cop in NYC, an ambitious wife; a disillusioned woman plenty of good feelings who suddenly will meet one each other in this little picture of low budget perhaps, but loaded of spring vision. There will be a gradual, very emotive and absolutely expected love affair between these solitaire souls, that will experience certainly new, varied, encountered and cruel emotions.I  have always been engaging with Bridget Fonda as actress. She possesses that delirious touch just reserved to a few artists. She illuminates the screen with her mesmerizing sidereal beauty ornamented with her nave smile; she is a lovely and very talented artist who stole the show along the picture. Rosie Perez is fine as the ambitious wife and the great Seymour Cassel as the elegant Jack Gross is terrific.

According to the urban legend website SNOPES, the real events involved a not-so-young waitress and a not-so-young police detective who together select the winning numbers to a $6 million jackpot. There was no hint of romance between the two. But that would be too open-ended for the cookie cutter mentalities behind this movie. They must have went into a conference room -- or a lunch room -- or a diner -- and derived this formulaic romance between two unhappily married people.Their result was this plot bringing together a Prince Charming, a Cinderella, a the Wicked Witch of New York. But they forget to include a nice dramatic flow of events. I just didn't experience any peaks and very little emotional depth. In the end, I wasn't satisfied.At least Nicholas Cage makes the most of the opportunity to be normal and charming rather than quirky and charming (one of his first such efforts). He gives the movie whatever depth it attains. Pretty Bridge Fonda gives her usual quiet, unexciting performance. They're responsible for most of the positive rating I give this movie.Rosie Perez, unfortunately, overwhelms the entire proceedings with nasally witchiness.

10195,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0767810856,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 7]","This story was inspired by an actual event and makes you believe that there are still nice people in the world.  One day a policeman (Charlie Lang, played by Nicholas Cage) must leave a restaurant in a hurry, and rather than leave without a tip he promises half the winnings of a lottery ticket to his waitress (Yvonne Biasi, played by Bridget Fonda), if the ticket should win.  The ticket wins, big time, and the conflict and stress begin.To contrast with the sweetness, though with a bit of cynical edge, of Charlie and Yvonne, is Charlie's wife Muriel, obnoxiously and effectively played by Rosie Perez.  Muriel is out for Muriel, and wants to get what she sees as hers, regardless of whatever promise Charlie may have made to Yvonne.We see Charlie conflicted as to what to do at first.  After all, Charlie certainly did not expect to win several million dollars on that lottery ticket.  However, Charlie wants to do the right thing, and he does.  As Charlie follows his heart, and what he believes is right, Charlie comes to realize that Yvonne has morals and a style more like his own, and Muriel is greedy and conniving and just not a very nice person.  While I was initially conflicted by Charlie's marriage to Muriel, because I believe strongly in marriage, there came a point where I just couldn't stand Muriel any more, and no belief in marriage would have made me stay with her.This story is a bit of a caricature and more than a bit trite, but somehow I wanted this variation on the Cinderella theme to work out and I had to follow it to the end.  I wanted the movie to work out because Yvonne was just a wonderfully nice person and she deserved a better life, and I decided that no matter what Muriel and Charlie were not going to work out.  I admit that I did come to the point where I wanted Charlie and Yvonne to get together, but I was not sure of exactly how to work that out without complications.In a way this movie is a bit of a guilty pleasure, because it does have a fair amount of predictability, though not all the details are predictable.  However, I like to watch happy ending movies sometimes, and this one has a wonderfully happy ending.  This movie works because of the great chemistry between Bridget Fonda and Nicholas Cage.  The combination of their character's believability, the sweet story, and the happy ending, just make this a fun movie to watch.

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT comes to mind.  Then there are those that are of a lesser order that you may remember vaguely a plot but not much else.  IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU is of this latter type.  This is not to say that director Andrew Bergman did not manage to convey several heart-warming complexities that inevitably result when unexpected riches collide with everyday life.Nicholas Cage plays police officer Charley Lang, who does not have enough money for a tip for waitress Yvonne (Bridget Fonda), but he does, however, have a Lotto ticket that he promises to split with her should he win.  Naturally, he does win, and it is his winning of four million dollars that changes the tone from that of light comedy to the more bitter world of sleaze and greed.  Charley's wife, Muriel (Rosie Perez) epitomizes the grasping, totally self-absorbed woman whose true feelings for Charley are dwarfed by her need to have it all.  There are some unnerving scenes of greed versus honesty played out in court that seem to validate the widespread belief that whenever huge sums of money are at stake, the participants had better get the details in writing.  There are two areas of the film that do not ring true.  The first is the unlikely pairing of the heartless Muriel with the heartfelt Charley.  Muriel comes off as a female Murdstone from Dickens' DAVID COPPERFIELD.  Her antagonism towards Charley is unfathomable.

You  know he's gonna win, too, because Charlie's all nice n' all and the  Waitress, (Bridget Fonda's &quot;Chavonne&quot;, I think it is?) is  down-on-her-luck and needs a big break. Charlie is married to racially  stereo-typed Spanish lady(Rosie Perez...what happened to her?) who whines  her way through the picture and insults him constantly. He loves her and  stays with her, even though she's the Wicked Witch of the West looking like  she was attacked by Dezi Arnaz's closet. Anyhow, Charlie wins the lottery  and ends up splitting the tip with his Waitress. Oh, and of course, you get  the obligitary love story when Charlie cheats on Rosie with his Waitress  after both of them run off to the Plaza Hotel after Rosie finds out that  they've been together doing &quot;friend&quot; things the entire afternoon.  Still following? Good. Now, you know that Charlie and the Waitress are  gonna end up together cuz he's reeallly, reeeeeally nice n' stuff and she's  sooo sweet and gentle and kind. Oh, and then there's this trial thing  thrown in for good measure wherein Charlie gets a slap on the hand for  cheating on Rosie and she tries to take the money away from him in the  process of divorcing. Charlie loses the bout as does the Waitress cuz an  American courtroom judge was reaaaallly awfully touched by Rosie's story  that SHE was the one who picked the winning numbers because her dead father  told them to her in a dream(HUH?). And Charlie and the Waitress sorta fall  outta love and go their separate ways for a bit until Charlie tells her  that he hasn't been able to stop thinking about her for days, so, they fall  back in love again. Oh, by the way, just because Charlie and the Waitress  open the Waitress's restaurant after hours and give a supposed street-bum a  bowl of soup in &quot;Their Darkest Hour&quot;, the next day, people from  around the country start to send cards(to her restaurant, no less)  containing cash because they're realllyy good-hearted people. They get  married and live happily ever after. The End.

10200,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,0767810856,"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[4, 5]","Nicolas Cage has always been hit of miss for me and in this film his quirky style works very well. Cage plays an all around good guy cop in this slightly uneven, but good natured comedy. Fonda is also very good and Rose Perez despite playing a very unlikable character does it so well you will cheer with glee when her fate is revealed at the end of the film.The film does seem a bit dated as the sum of money involved although a nice score, would hardly be enough to do so much with these days. Even in 1994 when the film was released it seems a little low. 4 million dollars split between two people after taxes would leave around 1 million dollars a piece, hardly enough to quit your job on, but certainly enough to change your life.My biggest gripe is that Cage and Perez seem so mismatched that you can't really figure out what brought these two together. It would have been nice to see Perez played a little more real and maybe get some insight about her. Was she always this greedy and ambitious(a very nice way to put it)? or did she become this way over time. They do talk about the relationship briefly, but it doesn't really give you much. If your husband is so upstanding it's hard to believe she would be the polar opposite. I'm not saying that she doesn't have a point, letting your husband give away 2 million dollars to a stranger would be a hard thing to do, but Cage seems to be this man with great character and I don't see the connection with him and his wife.Regardless of these flaws, the film is entertaining and does have a nice inspiring ending.
