794055,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00016JE5U,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Little House on the Prairie - Season 4The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience. These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events that were not suitable for children's books. This was NBC's highest rated series during most of its nine years. Here are the titles of the twenty-four shows.Disc 1.Castoffs.  Times of Change.My Ellen.  The Handyman.Disc 2.The Wolves.  The Creeper of Walnut Grove.To Run and Hide.  The Aftermath.Disc 3.The High Cost of Being Right . The Fighter.Meet Me at The Fair.  Looking Back at Season 4.Disc 4.Here Come the Brides.

I'm only fifteen so these episodes were all new for me and boy is season four a fantastic season. This season offers a few more very dramatic episodes than the previous season and I am fully convinced that these actors are the best actors in the history of television. Too bad I can't say this DVD collection is the best in the history of DVD's.There are a few problems like the last three releases with the quality of the film but hey, what are you gonna do, like I mentioned in my previous reviews in the pamphlet they explain that there may be scenes missing and film deterioration so I'll leave it at that. There is a bonus feature but don't get excited, it's entitled ""Insiders share their memories of season four""...in the form of notes. I'm sorry but I would much rather watch in interview than read notes with a very small font, nonetheless, they are interesting but if there were some better bonus material I would give this season a flat out five star rating. (Oh and there are a couple interesting stories in the pamphlet that I'd recommend looking at.)But all these little nit-picks aren't even a big deal because season four is fantastic! I don't think I can name my favorite episodes because they were all so good. There are quite a few changes in season four, Laura's dog Jack dies and Charles finds a stray dog called Bandit who becomes a member of the Ingalls family, Nellie falls in love with a surprising ending, Laura begins to become attracted to a boy at her school,  just to name a few. And some of these episodes are so intense! ""My Ellen"" is very creepy, Laura and Mary go swimming with a friend named Ellen who drowns, and Ellen's mother cannot accept her death, in this episode you definitely see how hard it must be to lose a loved one, but by far the most emotional episodes is the final two parter ""I'll Be Waving as You Drive Away"" as we witness the slow deterioration of Mary's eyesight.But really, it's impossible to list all of the best episodes because every episode is darn near perfect, all I can say is buy season four and every other season of Little House. I'm dying to get season five as fast as I can...oh yeah, WHERE THE HECK IS MR.

I read these books growing up and then loved the TV series as well.  Michael Landon, that I had seen on ""Bonanza"", was the icing on the cake:  one of my favorite actors helping to tell one of my favorite stories.Here's an episode guide, with a tiny description:1.

A Most Precious Gift:  Caroline has a new baby.21.  I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away (1):  Mary goes blind.22.  I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away (2):  Mary goes to a blind school in Iowa.I hope that Goldhil Home Media corrects what were problems in early season DVD's with some audio and visual quality problems, cut scenes, and episodes out of order.  The improvements we saw in the third season included chapters within episodes, and credits with each episode.  Although LHOTP was geared toward children, many adults watch it.

They looked SO good in fact, that it's as if they were filmed yesterday, and look far better than when they were originally broadcast.  I'm in awe at just how great many of them look!  That said...  Whoever is responsible for encoding several of the episodes in this 4TH set, and whoever is responsible for releasing them in this manner ought to be ashamed.  I've never seen a worse job of encoding for a DVD.  We have VERY poor video and audio quality in several of the episodes, plus severely hacked and missing scenes where the commercial breaks are.  Many of these episodes appear to be DVD's made from video tape copies of broadcast episodes.Remember watching the show on TBS?  For several episodes, you would be better off watching a tape of those rather than watching some of these on DVD.  Again, who would possibly release a set with so many flaws???  Several of the episodes in the earlier sets looked so good (with certain exceptions), but as the sets progress, it seems like the quality just continues to get worse and worse.  That being said, there are still certain episodes in the set which DO look very good, and have been VERY WELL restored, but on a whole, most are not up to par AT ALL!!I'm VERY dissapointed in the hack job they did on these.  You will simply have to try to ignore all of this in order to enjoy the top quality stories for one of the best television shows in history, which deserve a much better presentation than this!!  Sometimes you can ignore it.  Sometimes you can't, but you get used to it.  Despite this, I still strongly recommend buying the complete series, as I have a great respect for everyone involved in the production, including the actors, not to mention the much-needed values the show teaches.  5 stars, no, make that 100 stars for the production, and 1 star for the effort Goldhill made in restoring (restoring? what a joke!) this 4th DVD set.",3,"Poor DVD encoding, poor video & audio",1079568000,"03 18, 2004",2004,2001,"['sets', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'ARE', 'MANY', 'CRISP', 'CLEAR', 'SHARP', 'COLORFUL', 'EPISODES', 'IN', 'SETS', '1', 'TO', '3', 'looked', 'SO', 'good', 'fact', 'were', 'filmed', 'yesterday', 'look', 'far', 'better', 'when', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', ""'m"", 'awe', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'many', 'look', 'said', 'Whoever', 'responsible', 'encoding', 'several', 'episodes', '4TH', 'set', 'whoever', 'responsible', 'releasing', 'manner', 'ought', 'be', 'ashamed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'worse', 'job', 'encoding', 'DVD', 'have', 'VERY', 'poor', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'several', 'episodes', 'severely', 'hacked', 'missing', 'scenes', 'where', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'are', 'Many', 'episodes', 'appear', 'be', 'DVD', 'made', 'video', 'tape', 'copies', 'broadcast', 'episodes.Remember', 'watching', 'show', 'TBS', 'several', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'tape', 'rather', 'watching', 'DVD', 'Again', 'who', 'would', 'possibly', 'release', 'set', 'so', 'many', 'flaws', 'Several', 'episodes', 'earlier', 'sets', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'certain', 'exceptions', 'sets', 'progress', 'quality', 'just', 'get', 'worse', 'worse', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'still', 'certain', 'episodes', 'set', 'DO', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'been', 'VERY', 'WELL', 'restored', 'whole', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'par', 'AT', 'ALL', ""'m"", 'VERY', 'dissapointed', 'hack', 'job', 'did', 'will', 'simply', 'have', 'try', 'ignore', 'order', 'enjoy', 'top', 'quality', 'stories', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'shows', 'history', 'deserve', 'much', 'better', 'presentation', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'ignore', 'Sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'used', 'still', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'complete', 'series', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'everyone', 'involved', 'production', 'including', 'actors', 'not', 'mention', 'much-needed', 'values', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'make', '100', 'stars', 'production', '1', 'star', 'effort', 'Goldhill', 'made', 'restoring', 'restoring', 'what', 'joke', '4th', 'DVD', 'set']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 4

It is wonderful to watch the shows in order and to see how the series evolved through the seasons.  I have to say though that there are errors and those errors have been noticed.  Episodes are flipped around (season 3), segways to ""commercials"" are chopped, the box art and dvd art seem to be one season ahead, and there are many edited scenes - something I really didn't expect with dvds.  For example, I have an old vhs version of ""I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away"" and there are scenes on that tape that are NOT included in the season 4 boxed-set version of that episode!  I really hope season 5 fares better in this respect as every scene is important and should, if at all possible, be included!

Mainly due to Mary going blind, the birth of little Grace, and then following on from season 4, the developing relationship between Mary & Adam Kendall, briefly touched upon in season 4; and Laura growing up, and meeting Almanzo.There are some terrific episodes in this season, although it is disappointing, as there seems to be no sign of the fifth season coming out on DVD - maybe I just need to have patience, what do you think? There is still so much else to come, including Albert appearing as the Ingalls' adopted son (who actually appeared in an episode in this season, playing a young Charles!), Nellie Oleson getting married, and having a baby (poor child), and so many other great things. There were also some other episodes shown on UK TV here a few months ago, shown some obviously later episodes, which Michael Landon unfortunately doesn't appear much in, due to the fact he was very ill at this point. (He died in 1991 from pancreatic cancer) But who I did spot, making a very early TV appearance, was Shannen Doherty herself! Sporting a fetching pair of braids!Just a little bit of trivia for you - Melissa Gilbert (Laura) actually dated Tom Cruise when they were both teenagers, the lucky thing! And if you see a recent photo of her - she's certainly grown up since her days as Laura hasn't she?! Definitely two things that the guys will like that Laura definitely never had - or showed much of when she was older in the show!Some of the most powerful episodes in this season, was the last two - ""I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away"". This two-parter shows Mary dealing with the fact she is blind, and meeting Adam Kendall, her teacher, and later, her husband. It also shows the Ingalls, and everyone else having to leave Walnut Grove due to some railroad nonsense - never really explained, or else, I couldn't understand it! It's probably a good thing I was already crying when Mary woke up screaming, because everything was ""dark"".I can't wait for season five to come out. This DVD collection is perfect for anyone who grew up with this - and I certainly know I did! Every Sunday, Channel 4, brings back memories.Altogether now everyone: ""Old Man Tucker was a fine old man, washed his face in a frying pan, combed his hair with a wagon wheel...""",4,When are the rest due out?,1078358400,"03 4, 2004",2004,2334,"['always', 'remember', 'Season', '4', 'following', 'seasons', 'being', 'favourite', 'Mainly', 'due', 'Mary', 'going', 'blind', 'birth', 'little', 'Grace', 'then', 'following', 'season', '4', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Adam', 'Kendall', 'briefly', 'touched', 'season', '4', 'Laura', 'growing', 'up', 'meeting', 'Almanzo.There', 'are', 'terrific', 'episodes', 'season', 'disappointing', 'there', 'be', 'sign', 'fifth', 'season', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'maybe', 'just', 'need', 'have', 'patience', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'still', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'come', 'including', 'Albert', 'appearing', 'Ingalls', 'adopted', 'son', 'who', 'actually', 'appeared', 'episode', 'season', 'playing', 'young', 'Charles', 'Nellie', 'Oleson', 'getting', 'married', 'having', 'baby', 'poor', 'child', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'things', 'were', 'also', 'other', 'episodes', 'shown', 'UK', 'TV', 'here', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'shown', 'obviously', 'later', 'episodes', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'appear', 'much', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'ill', 'point', 'died', '1991', 'pancreatic', 'cancer', 'who', 'did', 'spot', 'making', 'very', 'early', 'TV', 'appearance', 'was', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'Sporting', 'fetching', 'pair', 'braids', 'Just', 'little', 'bit', 'trivia', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'Laura', 'actually', 'dated', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'when', 'were', 'teenagers', 'lucky', 'thing', 'see', 'recent', 'photo', 'certainly', 'grown', 'up', 'days', 'Laura', ""n't"", 'Definitely', 'two', 'things', 'guys', 'will', 'like', 'Laura', 'definitely', 'never', 'had', 'showed', 'much', 'when', 'was', 'older', 'show', 'most', 'powerful', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', 'last', 'two', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Waving', 'Drive', 'Away', 'two-parter', 'Mary', 'dealing', 'fact', 'blind', 'meeting', 'Adam', 'Kendall', 'teacher', 'later', 'husband', 'also', 'Ingalls', 'everyone', 'else', 'having', 'leave', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'due', 'railroad', 'nonsense', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'else', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'already', 'crying', 'when', 'Mary', 'woke', 'up', 'screaming', 'everything', 'was', 'dark', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'five', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'collection', 'perfect', 'anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'certainly', 'know', 'did', 'Every', 'Sunday', 'Channel', '4', 'back', 'memories.Altogether', 'now', 'everyone', 'Old', 'Man', 'Tucker', 'was', 'fine', 'old', 'man', 'washed', 'face', 'frying', 'pan', 'combed', 'hair', 'wagon', 'wheel']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 4

Connors,"[9, 10]","Time to hitch those horses and saddle up for another session of edited, and very washed out looking episodes of 'Little House on the Prairie', and by this I mean you are in for a very rocky ride through season IV!Before you buy, please consider the following:-Most of the episodes in this DVD set have cuts in with some extremely jarring moments when the picture goes hard to black.  The general picture quality is poor, being either cast towards one color, or looking very bleached.I must have been very lucky in the UK, because episodes broadcast in the 1970's were without cuts and played directly from 35mm film prints that looked fantastic!  I therefore find it very difficult, almost impossible, to understand why in the 21st century, and with all the technology now available, that what I am seeing today seems to have become an acceptable norm.So what are you watching on these DVD's?  Well, since digital restoration from film prints or film negatives never looks this terrible, there is only one answer: they must be recordings from old analogue video tapes.  This theory is supported by the fact that some episodes display tape dropout and tape creases.  It would also explain the cuts had the tapes been previously used by US broadcasters.Those with a keen eye will spot that in the small print on the later sets of LHOTP there is a disclaimer which states something along the lines of ""...have been taken from the best masters available"".Note the weasel word 'available'. Of course the best masters are the original film negatives. It would cost more effort, time and money to go that extra mile as do the less lazy DVD studios.",2,A WOEFUL PRESENTATION,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,1641,"['Time', 'hitch', 'horses', 'saddle', 'up', 'session', 'edited', 'very', 'washed', 'out', 'looking', 'episodes', ""'Little"", 'House', 'Prairie', 'mean', 'are', 'very', 'rocky', 'ride', 'season', 'IV', 'buy', 'please', 'consider', 'following', '-Most', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'cuts', 'extremely', 'jarring', 'moments', 'when', 'picture', 'hard', 'black', 'general', 'picture', 'quality', 'poor', 'being', 'cast', 'one', 'color', 'looking', 'very', 'bleached.I', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'lucky', 'UK', 'episodes', 'broadcast', '1970', 'were', 'cuts', 'played', 'directly', '35mm', 'film', 'prints', 'looked', 'fantastic', 'therefore', 'find', 'very', 'difficult', 'almost', 'impossible', 'understand', 'why', '21st', 'century', 'technology', 'now', 'available', 'what', 'am', 'seeing', 'today', 'have', 'become', 'acceptable', 'norm.So', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'DVD', 'Well', 'digital', 'restoration', 'film', 'prints', 'film', 'negatives', 'never', 'terrible', 'only', 'one', 'answer', 'must', 'be', 'recordings', 'old', 'analogue', 'video', 'tapes', 'theory', 'supported', 'fact', 'episodes', 'display', 'tape', 'dropout', 'tape', 'creases', 'would', 'also', 'explain', 'cuts', 'had', 'tapes', 'been', 'previously', 'used', 'US', 'broadcasters.Those', 'keen', 'eye', 'will', 'spot', 'small', 'print', 'later', 'sets', 'LHOTP', 'disclaimer', 'something', 'lines', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'best', 'masters', 'available', '.Note', 'weasel', 'word', ""'available"", 'course', 'best', 'masters', 'are', 'original', 'film', 'negatives', 'would', 'cost', 'more', 'effort', 'time', 'money', 'go', 'extra', 'mile', 'do', 'less', 'lazy', 'DVD', 'studios']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 4

And then came season 3 out and the trouble began.  All of a sudden the picture quality was not there anymore.  (Other reviewers wrote about it already.)  It looked worse than anything I had ever seen being offered on DVD before.I had been looking forward to buying all the seasons for my family and my grandchildren.  We know the stories from its first airing on TV.  What was I supposed to do?  I did buy season 4 again to see if it got better.  It did not improve.  It was just as bad again, maybe worse.  I will not buy any further seasons anymore if these transfers stay as poor in picture quality as they are now.  Even if it means that I and my family will cry about it.  I will show them ""The Waltons"", ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Road to Avonlea"" instead.At least you don't have to see what they are doing to your creation, Michael Landon!I am so sorry for you!

794084,AJGP5XYKKBGBG,B00016JE5U,Reliable Reviews,"[1, 1]","I enjoyed all 9 seasons. This show was well cast, as everyone has personality. Many of the characters are likeable, characters-to-admire. They actually put a lot of work into the sets, building the little house and the small town. There is great character-acting with the bratty kids Nellie and Willie, their bratty mother, their henpecked father, and the bachelor Mr. Edwards who teaches little Laura to spit a long distance, appalling her mother. They shoot on location in many episodes. The shots never look staged, taking you there. The stories are interesting, lively, moving, and uplifting, with some guest writers and guest stars for variety.The books have entirely different stories, and are very interesting. The books are true stories. Anyone who likes the TV show would like reading the books too. It is interesting how they lived and survived on the prairie. Laura Ingalls sure had a lot of adventures, with the family or family members just escaping death several times. Some of the show's pilot episode is in one of the books, but still very little, not even one book's worth of the nine book series. Laura Ingalls Wilder grew up just after the Civil War, living in Indian territory, that was not yet a State. Once her family was nearly killed by hundreds of Indians on the warpath. Yet she lived to see the automobile, airplane, color television, and the opening of Disneyland.Similar good series are: ""Anne of Green Gables"", ""Road to Avonlea seasons 1-6"", ""Christy - the complete series"", and fairly made ""Father Murphy seasons 1-2"".",5,Excellent.....and the Books are Different & Good.,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,1549,"['enjoyed', '9', 'seasons', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'everyone', 'personality', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'characters-to-admire', 'actually', 'put', 'lot', 'work', 'sets', 'building', 'little', 'house', 'small', 'town', 'great', 'character-acting', 'bratty', 'kids', 'Nellie', 'Willie', 'bratty', 'mother', 'henpecked', 'father', 'bachelor', 'Mr.', 'Edwards', 'who', 'little', 'Laura', 'spit', 'long', 'distance', 'appalling', 'mother', 'shoot', 'location', 'many', 'episodes', 'shots', 'never', 'look', 'staged', 'taking', 'there', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'lively', 'moving', 'uplifting', 'guest', 'writers', 'guest', 'stars', 'variety.The', 'books', 'have', 'entirely', 'different', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'books', 'are', 'true', 'stories', 'Anyone', 'who', 'TV', 'show', 'would', 'like', 'reading', 'books', 'too', 'interesting', 'how', 'lived', 'survived', 'prairie', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'sure', 'had', 'lot', 'adventures', 'family', 'family', 'members', 'just', 'escaping', 'death', 'several', 'times', 'show', 'pilot', 'episode', 'one', 'books', 'still', 'very', 'little', 'not', 'even', 'one', 'book', 'worth', 'nine', 'book', 'series', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'grew', 'up', 'just', 'Civil', 'War', 'living', 'Indian', 'territory', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'State', 'Once', 'family', 'was', 'nearly', 'killed', 'hundreds', 'Indians', 'warpath', 'lived', 'see', 'automobile', 'airplane', 'color', 'television', 'opening', 'Disneyland.Similar', 'good', 'series', 'are', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'seasons', '1-6', 'Christy', 'complete', 'series', 'fairly', 'made', 'Father', 'Murphy', 'seasons', '1-2']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 4

The emotions are raw and very much on the surface.  The acting is stellar - - in fact, Melissa Sue Anderson was nominated for an Emmy for her work as Mary in the two part episode.Additionally, characters such as Bandit the dog, Kezia, Joe Kagan and Adam Kendall would make their first appearances during this season.  And established characters such as Jack the dog, Miss Beadle (Mrs. Simms)and John Sanderson mark their final appearances during this season.All in all, a turning point for Little House and Walnut Grove and the end of the ""early"" episodes.
