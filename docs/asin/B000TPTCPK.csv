The music alone will get you moving. Length is over an hour and a half and includes 3 dances with warmup, step-by-step, performance and cool down for each dance. The dances are all energetic, sensual, hip and very fun. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with no or little dance experience because the pace is somewhat fast and she doesn't ""break it down"" but if you have experience you should get this dvd. I hope there will be another Bollyrobics dvd!",5,Hooked on Bollyrobics!,1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,562,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'less', 'week', 'am', 'already', 'hooked', 'Bollyrobics', 'What', 'blast', 'workout', 'music', 'alone', 'will', 'get', 'moving', 'Length', 'hour', 'half', '3', 'dances', 'warmup', 'step-by-step', 'performance', 'cool', 'down', 'dance', 'dances', 'are', 'energetic', 'sensual', 'hip', 'very', 'fun', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'little', 'dance', 'experience', 'pace', 'somewhat', 'fast', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'have', 'experience', 'should', 'get', 'dvd', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'Bollyrobics', 'dvd']",Bollyrobics Dance Workout

The production is very simple, no fancy sets, no glorious costume changes. But what it lacks in scenery is more than makes up for in substance.Each of the three dances has it's own warm up and workout section. The thing I like about this video compared to may of the other bollywood workout videos is that they are not turning bollywood moves into a workout. They are teaching you a dance number and that is your workout. To me that is much more enjoyable than a dance/setp aerobics mix that many bollywood workouts use.The music is great, and I love the veil routine. It's helping to shrink my flabby arms! It's not going to make your heart race or tire you out like some videos will do but it's a nice light workout to get you moving and do on days when you think ""Can I find any excuse not to work out today?""",5,"Actually learn a choreographed bollywood dance, 3 actually!",1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,880,"['video', 'not', 'have', 'glitz', 'glam', 'workout', 'videos', 'production', 'very', 'simple', 'fancy', 'sets', 'glorious', 'costume', 'changes', 'what', 'scenery', 'more', 'up', 'substance.Each', 'three', 'dances', 'own', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'thing', 'like', 'video', 'compared', 'may', 'other', 'bollywood', 'videos', 'are', 'not', 'turning', 'bollywood', 'moves', 'workout', 'are', 'teaching', 'dance', 'number', 'workout', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'dance/setp', 'aerobics', 'mix', 'many', 'bollywood', 'workouts', 'use.The', 'music', 'great', 'love', 'veil', 'routine', 'helping', 'shrink', 'flabby', 'arms', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'heart', 'race', 'tire', 'out', 'videos', 'will', 'do', 'nice', 'light', 'workout', 'get', 'moving', 'do', 'days', 'when', 'think', 'Can', 'find', 'excuse', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'today']",Bollyrobics Dance Workout

1091705,A340KVMHSQ9FG5,B000TPTCPK,Lauren Noelle Clarke,"[0, 0]","While I loved the dance routines and the fact that this DVD gives you 3 separate workouts/routines, it is a bit boring and repetitive.  During the workout, it is just a single unsmiling dancer with a green-screen background and the music is the same for all 3 workouts--enjoyable at first but gets old fast (the music for the actual routines is different and great).  The warm-ups and cool downs are also the same for all 3 workouts.  Some of the moves are a little confusing at first but she repeats them many times.  I liked how she built up the moves to the whole routine--starting with the feet, adding arms, quickening the tempo for each step before moving on to the next combination.  You keep moving the whole time.  I think if the production values had been a bit higher, so would've my rating.",3,"Cute dances, poor production",1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,802,"['loved', 'dance', 'routines', 'fact', 'DVD', '3', 'separate', 'workouts/routines', 'bit', 'boring', 'repetitive', 'workout', 'just', 'single', 'unsmiling', 'dancer', 'green-screen', 'background', 'music', 'same', '3', 'workouts', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'old', 'fast', 'music', 'actual', 'routines', 'different', 'great', 'warm-ups', 'cool', 'downs', 'are', 'also', 'same', '3', 'workouts', 'moves', 'are', 'little', 'confusing', 'first', 'repeats', 'many', 'times', 'liked', 'how', 'built', 'up', 'moves', 'whole', 'routine', 'starting', 'feet', 'adding', 'arms', 'quickening', 'tempo', 'step', 'moving', 'next', 'combination', 'keep', 'moving', 'whole', 'time', 'think', 'production', 'values', 'had', 'been', 'bit', 'higher', 'so', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rating']",Bollyrobics Dance Workout

I love the fact it has my favorite song (Chaiyya Chaiyya) and the other two are fabulous. I'm just sticking to Chaiyya Chaiyya and I can't make it to the performance just yet but Julia is pretty good at simplifying things and making it fairly easy to understand. However, I do have some complaints that overall are pretty minor. The hand movements aren't necessarily difficult but I would have liked the camera to have done a close up for a few minutes of her hand movements so that I can understand them better. Also, there are times when I would have liked the camera to have shown more close-ups of the leg movements too because there were times when it was hard to see what the legs were doing since it was from the front. It was pretty much left up to me to do guess work ^_^ Still, this is a lot of fun and I'm going to enjoy learning all the dances. I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to get a taste of Bollywood dancing as well as get a great workout.

1091708,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B000TPTCPK,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[58, 61]","This DVD comes in several languages: English, Hindu, Spanish, French, Japanese & music only (same beat for all menu choices).It has 3 different dances, Maahi Ve, Chaiyya Chaiyya. Each section is 30-35 min each w/a warm-up, step by step, the 3 min dance performance itself & a cool down. The warm-ups & cool downs are all the same for all 3 dances.From their website:Songs from Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Bombay Dreams"" and the Bollywood film ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"" (Indian Love Story -- Tomorrow May Never Come) featuring Shahrukh Khan provide the music to 3 dances, each with an increasing level of difficulty and unique style which varies from playful and sensual to dynamic and powerful.The woman on the dvd, Julia Casper, is the one dancing. At the dance portion, it's just her 3x with computer graphics.Warm-up - uses basic dancing you will use to get you into it before the step by step portion.Step by step - shows you the moves, she does break it down, such as only showing the veil first, then the veil & feet & then finally adding the hands. She even does it at a slower pace for faster moves before going normal speed. Each move is done at least 4x if not many more times. She gives great body movement cues, not just counts in 8s.Cool down - is nice, added head rolls like the warm up, but also adds some standing fwd bends, lunges to really stretch.I enjoyed Julia's presence, the breakdown was easy to follow & I felt more aware of my body to move better. I don't like this style of dancing as much as Latin or belly dancing or even hip hop, but there were a few moves I thought were great. Julia's style actually encouraged me to get into it more then I would have.I took off 1 star because of lack of music during the step by step which made it drag on & boring (music only option will come in handy if replay it at later date). Though practice repetition is great & needed for any dance instruction, with the slower down & breakdown, there did not need to be so much, especially on moves that would not get the heart rate up. If these were aerobic moves, that would be great as exercise, but most were easy & required little physical effort.After completing the step by step once, I will only replay the dance portions only for aerobic workout. I would love for Julia & production to put out more dances of different styles with my suggestions in the future.Their site is bollyrobics com & all 3 dances are on youtube in all the languages.",4,"Fun, easy to follow, great music & moves, though slow/non-music teaching portion",1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,2445,"['DVD', 'several', 'languages', 'English', 'Hindu', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Japanese', 'music', 'only', 'same', 'beat', 'menu', 'choices', '.It', '3', 'different', 'dances', 'Maahi', 'Ve', 'Chaiyya', 'Chaiyya', 'section', '30-35', 'min', 'w/a', 'warm-up', 'step', 'step', '3', 'min', 'dance', 'performance', 'cool', 'down', 'warm-ups', 'cool', 'downs', 'are', 'same', '3', 'dances.From', 'website', 'Songs', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Bombay', 'Dreams', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'Kal', 'Ho', 'Naa', 'Ho', 'Indian', 'Love', 'Story', 'Tomorrow', 'May', 'Never', 'Come', 'featuring', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'provide', 'music', '3', 'dances', 'increasing', 'level', 'difficulty', 'unique', 'style', 'playful', 'sensual', 'dynamic', 'powerful.The', 'woman', 'dvd', 'Julia', 'Casper', 'one', 'dancing', 'dance', 'portion', 'just', '3x', 'computer', 'graphics.Warm-up', 'basic', 'dancing', 'will', 'use', 'get', 'step', 'step', 'portion.Step', 'step', 'moves', 'break', 'down', 'such', 'only', 'showing', 'veil', 'first', 'then', 'veil', 'feet', 'then', 'finally', 'adding', 'hands', 'even', 'slower', 'pace', 'faster', 'moves', 'going', 'normal', 'speed', 'move', 'done', 'least', '4x', 'not', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'great', 'body', 'movement', 'cues', 'not', 'just', 'counts', '8s.Cool', 'nice', 'added', 'head', 'rolls', 'warm', 'up', 'also', 'standing', 'fwd', 'bends', 'lunges', 'really', 'stretch.I', 'enjoyed', 'Julia', 'presence', 'breakdown', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'felt', 'more', 'aware', 'body', 'move', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'style', 'dancing', 'as', 'much', 'Latin', 'belly', 'dancing', 'even', 'hip', 'hop', 'were', 'few', 'moves', 'thought', 'were', 'great', 'Julia', 'style', 'actually', 'encouraged', 'get', 'more', 'then', 'would', 'have.I', 'took', 'off', '1', 'star', 'lack', 'music', 'step', 'step', 'made', 'drag', 'boring', 'music', 'only', 'option', 'will', 'come', 'handy', 'replay', 'later', 'date', 'practice', 'repetition', 'great', 'needed', 'dance', 'instruction', 'slower', 'down', 'breakdown', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'especially', 'moves', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'were', 'aerobic', 'moves', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'exercise', 'most', 'were', 'easy', 'required', 'little', 'physical', 'effort.After', 'completing', 'step', 'step', 'once', 'will', 'only', 'replay', 'dance', 'portions', 'only', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'would', 'love', 'Julia', 'production', 'put', 'out', 'more', 'dances', 'different', 'styles', 'suggestions', 'future.Their', 'site', 'bollyrobics', 'com', '3', 'dances', 'are', 'youtube', 'languages']",Bollyrobics Dance Workout
1091709,ACZEW7QN3XCTH,B000TPTCPK,Virginia Mercurio,"[0, 2]","I like to dance, but I'm not very good at it.  I'm a bit of a klutz.  I'm familiar enough with Bollywood style dance that I thought that this would be a good addition to my dance DVDs, and another fun dance/workout.  I wasn't thrilled with this DVD.When it comes to Bollywood style dance, I'm a beginner.  I have a couple of Bollywood dance DVDs, and I figured that trying a Bollyrobics DVD would be excellent.  This dance workout is by no means for beginners.  Some familiarity with Bollywood style dance is definitely needed.  I tried to get through one of the three dances on this DVD.  I couldn't get through the step-by-step.  I have enough coordination that if someone walks me through a dance, I can do it, I can learn.  I learned and was able to do a fairly fast waltz for my wedding, so it's not like I have two left feet.  But this...this I just couldn't do.  I felt that the transitions were too quick.  Maybe I'm still very much a beginner, but I need the steps to a dance taught to me more than 2 or 3 times at half speed before going into full speed.I also really didn't like the woman who is doing the dances on the DVD.  She didn't seem to be very enthused about the dances.  She's an excellent dancer, but she doesn't seem happy about it, at least during the step by step portions.  I sat down and watched the actual dances, and she half smiles a couple of times during them.  The fact that she doesn't speak the whole time is disconcerting.  She came across as very robotic, and against the digital backdrop, rather cartoony.  Like it wasn't a real person on the DVD.  The voice over was alright.  Not very informative and helpful, but pleasant sounding.There are no extras on this DVD.  Most of the dance workout DVDs I own have at least a bonus performance by the dancer.  Absolutely nothing.  The only ""perks"" beyond what look like good dances is a choice of voice over languages.  So if you're brushing up on your German, Hindi, or whatever while you learn to dance, you're in luck with this one.I did like the music on the DVD.  It did make me want to get up and learn to Bollywood dance.  The music, I think, is the one saving grace on this one for me.
