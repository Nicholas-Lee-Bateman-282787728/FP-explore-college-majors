I loved Jack's deadpan delivery, his tightwad persona, and his supporting cast.  His influence would later be exhibited by performers like Johnny Carson and Bob Newhart.  This film disappointed me somewhat.  At a brief 57 minutes it seems a little stretched out.  Even at half the running time there's not enough material sufficient for a single episode of Jack's TV show.  Highlights of the film are the exchanges between Jack and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson.  Divorce those moments and your not really left with much.  Not a complete waste of time but not on the level of Jack's other screen ventures like ""Charley's Aunt"" or ""To Be or Not To Be"".",3,For Benny Completists Only,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,768,"['fondest', 'memories', 'kid', 'was', 'rushing', 'home', 'school', 'watch', 'repeats', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Program', 'UHF', 'loved', 'Jack', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'tightwad', 'persona', 'supporting', 'cast', 'influence', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'exhibited', 'performers', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'film', 'disappointed', 'somewhat', 'brief', '57', 'minutes', 'little', 'stretched', 'out', 'Even', 'running', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'material', 'sufficient', 'single', 'episode', 'Jack', 'TV', 'show', 'Highlights', 'film', 'are', 'exchanges', 'Jack', 'Eddie', 'Rochester', 'Anderson', 'Divorce', 'moments', 'not', 'really', 'left', 'much', 'Not', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'not', 'level', 'Jack', 'other', 'screen', 'ventures', 'Charley', 'Aunt', 'Be', 'Not', 'Be']",The Meanest Man In The World

Jack finds himself having to be a real meanie to everyone, hence the title of the film.

1641044,A1QW1D1SCXFYG7,B00BY8DM20,Robert Butterfield,"[0, 0]","I love Jack Benny's comedy.  The major problem with the film is, that like a lot of things is dated.  I hadn't seen it in years and some of the references and bits are a little old.  Some of it is good, not just quite as funny as I remembered it from seeing it on television 50 years ago.  Perhaps the fact that George M. Cohan wrote the story has something to do with &#34;age&#34; factor.",3,The Meanest Man in the World,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,390,"['love', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'comedy', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'lot', 'things', 'dated', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'references', 'bits', 'are', 'little', 'old', 'good', 'not', 'just', 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'television', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'George', 'M.', 'Cohan', 'wrote', 'story', 'something', 'do', '34', 'age', '34', 'factor']",The Meanest Man In The World
