155367,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,0792846133,,"[2, 2]","This Academy Award winner in 1946, directed by William Wyler, depicts the return of three WWII vets who meet on a plane back to their middle America home town of Boone City. The three, played by Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell each have readjustments after being away for three years. The most obvious readjustment is for Al Parrish, Russell's role, who lost both hands in the war. He was fitted with prosthetic hooks which he learned to use very adeptly. Nontheless, he returns to a place where he will be pitied and where the reaction of his fiancee is uncertain. Russell, was, in fact, an amputee. He lost his hands in the war so, to a large extent, he was playing himself.Frederic March plays Al Stevenson, an older bank executive who was a seargent in the war, He comes home to a loving family and wonderful wife played by Myrna Loy. However, even he has serious readjustments. He comes home to see his children older and very much changed. Things are not the way he left them and these changes are difficult to absrorb. His first night home is spent with his wife and daughter as they hit the local nightclubs with Al getting drunker and drunker. He hooks up with his recent companions as they all celebrate. Although it's a night of fun and celebration, there is a darker side as the best way he can think of to reunite with his family is to get drunk. The message is that he can't cope with the changes he has encountered and must medicate himself.Dana Andrews plays a returning pilot who had recently been married before he left for the war. It soon becomes clear that he and his wife didn't know each other well when they married and the prospect of his returning to work as a drug store soda jerk is not the life his wife wants. Clearly, this is a marriage that won't work. Maenwhile, he finds a possible new love interest in an unlikely place. To make matters more uncertain, he discovers that the drug store, which was owned by an individual, has been absorbed by a large chain and his relationships at work will be very different.Was the pre war past the best years of their lives or was it the time they served in the armed forces? Have the obstacles to readjustment made the future bleak; or, is there hope that their lives will be straightened out and the best years are yet to come? I highly recommend this great classic.",5,An Oscar winning classic,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,2356,"['Academy', 'Award', 'winner', '1946', 'directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'return', 'three', 'WWII', 'vets', 'who', 'meet', 'plane', 'back', 'middle', 'America', 'home', 'town', 'Boone', 'City', 'three', 'played', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'have', 'readjustments', 'being', 'away', 'three', 'years', 'most', 'obvious', 'readjustment', 'Al', 'Parrish', 'Russell', 'role', 'who', 'lost', 'hands', 'war', 'was', 'fitted', 'prosthetic', 'hooks', 'learned', 'use', 'very', 'adeptly', 'Nontheless', 'place', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'pitied', 'where', 'reaction', 'fiancee', 'uncertain', 'Russell', 'was', 'fact', 'amputee', 'lost', 'hands', 'war', 'so', 'large', 'extent', 'was', 'playing', 'himself.Frederic', 'March', 'Al', 'Stevenson', 'older', 'bank', 'executive', 'who', 'was', 'seargent', 'war', 'home', 'loving', 'family', 'wonderful', 'wife', 'played', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'However', 'even', 'serious', 'readjustments', 'home', 'see', 'children', 'older', 'very', 'much', 'changed', 'Things', 'are', 'not', 'way', 'left', 'changes', 'are', 'difficult', 'absrorb', 'first', 'night', 'home', 'spent', 'wife', 'daughter', 'hit', 'local', 'nightclubs', 'Al', 'getting', 'drunker', 'drunker', 'up', 'recent', 'companions', 'celebrate', 'night', 'fun', 'celebration', 'darker', 'side', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'reunite', 'family', 'get', 'drunk', 'message', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'changes', 'encountered', 'must', 'medicate', 'himself.Dana', 'Andrews', 'returning', 'pilot', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'been', 'married', 'left', 'war', 'soon', 'clear', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'well', 'when', 'married', 'prospect', 'returning', 'work', 'drug', 'store', 'soda', 'jerk', 'not', 'life', 'wife', 'Clearly', 'marriage', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'Maenwhile', 'possible', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'unlikely', 'place', 'make', 'matters', 'more', 'uncertain', 'drug', 'store', 'was', 'owned', 'individual', 'been', 'absorbed', 'large', 'chain', 'relationships', 'work', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'different.Was', 'pre', 'war', 'best', 'years', 'lives', 'was', 'time', 'served', 'armed', 'forces', 'Have', 'obstacles', 'readjustment', 'made', 'future', 'bleak', 'there', 'hope', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'straightened', 'out', 'best', 'years', 'are', 'yet', 'come', 'highly', 'recommend', 'great', 'classic']",The Best Years of Our Lives
155368,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0792846133,,"[2, 2]","This is one picture that I never tire of after repeated viewings and I have seen this picture MANY times over the years.This pictures' theme which centers around the trials and tribulations of three WW2 vets returning home and their efforts to reintegrate back into civilian life is as timeless as the picture itself.And it plays as well today and speaks the same truths as it did back in 1946.Director William Wyler did a masterful job of keeping everything taut and focused as the movie unfolds before us.Harold Russell who plays a navy vet whose hands and forearm have been lost in an aboard ship battle won two Oscars for his portrayal.And this for a man who really had no formal training as an actor.He landed the part after being spotted in a Naval training film explaining how he lost his appendages.Dana Andrews did a wonderful job playing the returning AAF bombardier.His moods and reactions to an unwelcoming civilan population hit the mark everytime.And screen veteran Frederic March playing an army sergeant I thought stole the picture on many occasions.He infused his character with just the right combination of emotions.His is the one we see with the most potential for an easy re-entry into society but as time progresses it's painfully obvious he is dealing with as much &quot;crap&quot; as his two other friends.All three have their own seperate stories which unfold wonderfully but all are inextricably bound by their attempts to just be accepted for who they are now,not what they were.They don't necessarily want to forget their pasts(how can they?),they just want to move on.And as we watch them we empathise and sympathize with them all the way.The picture works on so many levels with the characters touching us all in some small way that it easily elevates it above your average run of the mill war picture.And it's easy to see why this picture hit home poignantly touching a nationwide nerve just after the war.The movie is rounded out by a stellar supporting cast as I can find no real fault with any of them from relatives to children.All played it straight down the middle and under Wylers'  hand give no more nor no less than each scene needed.Watch out for brief and uncredited cameos by bigband leader Gene Krupa singer and Anita O'Day.This is one movie that is a must see AND must own.It clocks in at  an impressive 170 minutes but you find yourself so engrossed with the plot and characters that in the end it seems more like 70 minutes.One of the best movies ever made and in my top ten.",5,A must on any top ten list!!,1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,2522,"['one', 'picture', 'never', 'tire', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'have', 'seen', 'picture', 'MANY', 'times', 'years.This', 'pictures', 'theme', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'three', 'WW2', 'vets', 'returning', 'home', 'efforts', 'reintegrate', 'back', 'civilian', 'life', 'as', 'timeless', 'picture', 'as', 'well', 'today', 'same', 'truths', 'did', 'back', '1946.Director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'keeping', 'everything', 'taut', 'focused', 'movie', 'us.Harold', 'Russell', 'who', 'navy', 'vet', 'hands', 'forearm', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'aboard', 'ship', 'battle', 'won', 'two', 'Oscars', 'portrayal.And', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'had', 'formal', 'training', 'actor.He', 'landed', 'part', 'being', 'spotted', 'Naval', 'training', 'film', 'explaining', 'how', 'lost', 'appendages.Dana', 'Andrews', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'playing', 'returning', 'AAF', 'bombardier.His', 'moods', 'reactions', 'unwelcoming', 'civilan', 'population', 'hit', 'mark', 'everytime.And', 'screen', 'veteran', 'Frederic', 'March', 'playing', 'army', 'sergeant', 'thought', 'stole', 'picture', 'many', 'occasions.He', 'infused', 'character', 'just', 'right', 'combination', 'emotions.His', 'one', 'see', 'most', 'potential', 'easy', 're-entry', 'society', 'time', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'dealing', 'as', 'much', 'quot', 'crap', 'quot', 'two', 'other', 'friends.All', 'three', 'have', 'own', 'seperate', 'stories', 'unfold', 'wonderfully', 'are', 'inextricably', 'bound', 'attempts', 'just', 'be', 'accepted', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'not', 'what', 'were.They', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'want', 'forget', 'pasts', 'how', 'can', 'just', 'want', 'move', 'on.And', 'watch', 'empathise', 'sympathize', 'way.The', 'picture', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'characters', 'touching', 'small', 'way', 'easily', 'average', 'run', 'mill', 'war', 'picture.And', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'picture', 'hit', 'home', 'poignantly', 'touching', 'nationwide', 'nerve', 'just', 'war.The', 'movie', 'rounded', 'out', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'can', 'find', 'real', 'fault', 'relatives', 'children.All', 'played', 'straight', 'down', 'middle', 'Wylers', 'hand', 'give', 'more', 'less', 'scene', 'needed.Watch', 'out', 'brief', 'uncredited', 'cameos', 'bigband', 'leader', 'Gene', 'Krupa', 'singer', 'Anita', ""O'Day.This"", 'one', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'AND', 'must', 'own.It', 'clocks', 'impressive', '170', 'minutes', 'find', 'so', 'engrossed', 'plot', 'characters', 'end', 'more', '70', 'minutes.One', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'top', 'ten']",The Best Years of Our Lives

A Place in the Sun with Shelly Winters and Montgomery Cliff, The Third Man in Orson Welles' style, An American in Paris with Gene Kelly, The Wild Bunch with William Holden, Cleopatra with Richard Burton, The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover with Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) and Helen Mirren have all provided an evening's worth of top notch entertainment.Some of the old Chaplin stuff is next.Watched Best Years of Our Lives (1946) with Myrna Loy last night. Long, but excellent film about three WWII veterans returning home to their women and jobs.Considering that this was made a year after WWII ended, and one of the soldiers is severally maimed, this is an excellent portrait of people's real day-to-day lives. Winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actor and screenplay, William Wyler's brilliant drama about adjustment is one of the all-time classics of American cinema. It spans a complex range of honest emotions, from joyous celebration and happy reunion to deep-rooted ambivalence and reassessment of personal priorities.In vivid contrast to the gorgeous lighting, which decorates The Cook et, all as if every scene is a carnival show, this B&W; movie illuminates every nook and cranny. All the rooms are sunny and happy, as if it is always mid-day: even the closet is lit, casting shadows into the room. The effect is the raw wood of truth; unvarnished reality for those three men and the women who love them.Deus ex machine is a Greek and Roman dramatic trick, where a god/person/machine suddenly resolves the plot, extricating the protagonist from a difficult situation: in Westerns, the cavalry arrives to save the day. In a brilliant reversal of deus ex machine, the director shows just how much he really was involved in every nuance of this personal story.Long before special effects, Hollywood relied more on dialogue, emotional acting and sheer entertainment talent to tell a story. Here the director changed the script to employ a severally disabled non-actor, Harold Russell (in his one and only film role) as a sailor who lost both hands in an explosion. During the film, you marvel as Russell uses his metal hooks, but never see his arms without them. The director wisely keeps this for the end.In a pivotal scene, the maimed Russell removes the machinery (his hands) from the plot, revealing his all too human self.I hate when great books are made into mediocre movies (even though I have to see them). I hate when great movies are redone into mediocre ones. Yet I think this movie needs to be redone. If Dracula can be on stage, this movie might even be possible to reprise on the stage.This movie needs to be redone because:&#61553; as a war movie without violence, it is real and relevant today&#61553; history has forgotten the actors&#61553; the vintage small town footage is quaint, but outdated&#61553; it needs updating: the risqu&eacute; of divorce for example is gone&#61553; the lighting makes it look as if the whole thing was shot on a sound stage&#61553; it needs color&#61553; it needs a new war",4,AFI 100 Best Movies,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,3277,"['have', 'seen', 'almost', 'American', 'Film', 'Institutes', '100', 'Best', 'Movies', 'used', 'library', 'Intelliflix', 'scout', 'out', 'dozen', 'so', 'films', 'have', 'not', 'seen.So', 'far', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Place', 'Sun', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'Montgomery', 'Cliff', 'Third', 'Man', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'style', 'American', 'Paris', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'William', 'Holden', 'Cleopatra', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Cook', 'Thief', 'Wife', 'Lover', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Dumbledore', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'have', 'provided', 'evening', 'worth', 'top', 'notch', 'entertainment.Some', 'old', 'Chaplin', 'stuff', 'next.Watched', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', '1946', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'last', 'night', 'Long', 'excellent', 'film', 'three', 'WWII', 'veterans', 'returning', 'home', 'women', 'jobs.Considering', 'was', 'made', 'year', 'WWII', 'ended', 'one', 'soldiers', 'severally', 'maimed', 'excellent', 'portrait', 'people', 'real', 'day-to-day', 'lives', 'Winner', 'seven', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'best', 'picture', 'director', 'actor', 'screenplay', 'William', 'Wyler', 'brilliant', 'drama', 'adjustment', 'one', 'all-time', 'classics', 'American', 'cinema', 'complex', 'range', 'honest', 'emotions', 'joyous', 'celebration', 'happy', 'reunion', 'deep-rooted', 'ambivalence', 'reassessment', 'personal', 'priorities.In', 'vivid', 'contrast', 'gorgeous', 'lighting', 'Cook', 'et', 'all', 'scene', 'carnival', 'show', 'B', 'W', 'movie', 'nook', 'cranny', 'rooms', 'are', 'sunny', 'happy', 'always', 'mid-day', 'even', 'closet', 'lit', 'casting', 'shadows', 'room', 'effect', 'raw', 'wood', 'truth', 'unvarnished', 'reality', 'three', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'love', 'them.Deus', 'ex', 'machine', 'Greek', 'Roman', 'dramatic', 'trick', 'where', 'god/person/machine', 'suddenly', 'plot', 'extricating', 'protagonist', 'difficult', 'situation', 'Westerns', 'cavalry', 'save', 'day', 'brilliant', 'reversal', 'deus', 'ex', 'machine', 'director', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'was', 'involved', 'nuance', 'personal', 'story.Long', 'special', 'effects', 'Hollywood', 'relied', 'more', 'dialogue', 'emotional', 'acting', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'talent', 'tell', 'story', 'Here', 'director', 'changed', 'script', 'employ', 'severally', 'disabled', 'non-actor', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'one', 'only', 'film', 'role', 'sailor', 'who', 'lost', 'hands', 'explosion', 'film', 'marvel', 'Russell', 'metal', 'hooks', 'never', 'see', 'arms', 'director', 'wisely', 'end.In', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'maimed', 'Russell', 'machinery', 'hands', 'plot', 'revealing', 'too', 'human', 'self.I', 'hate', 'when', 'great', 'books', 'are', 'made', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'even', 'have', 'see', 'hate', 'when', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'redone', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'think', 'movie', 'be', 'redone', 'Dracula', 'can', 'be', 'stage', 'movie', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'possible', 'reprise', 'stage.This', 'movie', 'needs', 'be', 'redone', '61553', 'war', 'movie', 'violence', 'real', 'relevant', 'today', '61553', 'history', 'forgotten', 'actors', '61553', 'vintage', 'small', 'town', 'footage', 'quaint', 'outdated', '61553', 'updating', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'divorce', 'example', 'gone', '61553', 'lighting', 'look', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'shot', 'sound', 'stage', '61553', 'color', '61553', 'new', 'war']",The Best Years of Our Lives
155371,A1DTCJV6KOMJOA,0792846133,A*,"[4, 4]",A lot of people say this film plays like a Soap Opera but it really doesn't. It is just a honest look at what happens when some veterans returen from war. From the opening sequence we are all confronted with a sense of urgency and longing for how bad the men want to return to their normal lives! But their lives aren't normal Al Stephenson (Fredric March) realizes his kids have grown older and don't have the same bond with their father. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) is trapped in a wreck of a marriage and Homer Parish (Harrold Parrish) was disfigured in the war and wonders if his family will accept him. This film is all about the human condition and the after effects of war. How can one rebuild ones life after being responsible for the death of others on the opposing side. How can you return to a life that you left behind when the world moves forward while the war seems to be standing still in your mind. This film never once goes for sap and every scene is raw and full of emotion and power! It is still relevant today due to the fact that the cruel mannerisms of war are still being felt and fought around the world.

155377,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792846133,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","Another notch on the belt of Best Picture Winners I've finally seen, `The Best Years of Our Lives' was one of those films I didn't expect to love.  It looked overly long (almost three hours), somewhat stuffy and messagy (you know those films, and yes, I made that word up) and dated, which can be the kiss of death for a film nearly seventy years old.  Still, I had to see it (how can a true cinephile not) and so I settled in this past weekend to indulge.I was riveted.There are few films that can sustain such a dramatic central theme for that long a period of time without ever feeling overwhelming, and `The Best Years of Our Lives' does so with complete ease.  It endears the audience from the opening frame and keeps us glued till the closing one.  I didn't expect this at all, but I was swallowed up and never wanted it to end.Yes, I was sad to see that it was over.The central storyline of William Wyler's Oscar winning 1946 classic revolves around three WWII vets who return home after years away and try to adjust to civilian life with difficulty.  Al Stephenson has been married for twenty years, has two practically grown children and a very well-paying job at the bank waiting for him, and yet rediscovering who his family is and butting heads with his boss over the way in which vets should be treated takes a toll on him.  Fred Derry doesn't have any of that.  He was only married for a mere twenty days before shipping off and so his wife Marie isn't exactly what he bargained for.  She wants the finer things, but after exhausting his money from the army he realizes that life isn't easy for a vet with no real skills.  Working at a department store just isn't cutting it.  And then you have Homer Parrish, a Navy man who lost both his hands in the war and is dealing with personal insecurities that weigh heavy on him, especially since he can't see how his fianc&eacute;e could still be interested in him.`The Best Years of Our Lives' weaves these stories with such fluidity and really embraces each of them with such heart and soul, giving us a real reason to root for each of these men to succeed and find the peace they need to move on.  March, Andrews and Russell are astonishingly good in their roles.  I'm sad that Andrews received no awards attention (he could have at least been nominated alongside March) and I do think that a lot of Russell's win was attributed to the fact that he was a true war vet with no acting experience (and really had lost his hands) and thus served as a true inspiration (thus the reason he has TWO Oscars for this performance) but one can't really fault his win, even if Claude Raines should have won.  Even the women here are outstanding, with Myrna Loy and Virginia Mayo really making the most of their roles.Beautifully acted, profoundly written and directed to perfection, `The Best Years of Our Lives' is raw, earnest and honest and captures a truth that many films could only dream of.  It is still profound and meaningful today, hitting with great power and presence and just completely worth every single second it takes to watch.",5,One of the best films of all time...,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,3093,"['notch', 'belt', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Winners', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'seen', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'love', 'looked', 'overly', 'long', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'somewhat', 'stuffy', 'messagy', 'know', 'films', 'yes', 'made', 'word', 'up', 'dated', 'can', 'be', 'kiss', 'death', 'film', 'nearly', 'seventy', 'years', 'old', 'Still', 'had', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'true', 'cinephile', 'not', 'so', 'settled', 'past', 'weekend', 'indulge.I', 'was', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'sustain', 'such', 'dramatic', 'central', 'theme', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'ever', 'feeling', 'overwhelming', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'so', 'complete', 'ease', 'audience', 'opening', 'frame', 'glued', 'closing', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'swallowed', 'up', 'never', 'wanted', 'end.Yes', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'was', 'over.The', 'central', 'storyline', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Oscar', 'winning', '1946', 'classic', 'revolves', 'three', 'WWII', 'vets', 'who', 'return', 'home', 'years', 'away', 'try', 'adjust', 'civilian', 'life', 'difficulty', 'Al', 'Stephenson', 'been', 'married', 'twenty', 'years', 'two', 'practically', 'grown', 'children', 'very', 'well-paying', 'job', 'bank', 'waiting', 'yet', 'rediscovering', 'who', 'family', 'butting', 'heads', 'boss', 'way', 'vets', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'toll', 'Fred', 'Derry', ""n't"", 'have', 'was', 'only', 'married', 'mere', 'twenty', 'days', 'shipping', 'off', 'so', 'wife', 'Marie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'bargained', 'finer', 'things', 'exhausting', 'money', 'army', 'life', ""n't"", 'easy', 'vet', 'real', 'skills', 'Working', 'department', 'store', 'just', ""n't"", 'cutting', 'then', 'have', 'Homer', 'Parrish', 'Navy', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'hands', 'war', 'dealing', 'personal', 'insecurities', 'weigh', 'heavy', 'especially', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'e', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'interested', 'him.', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'weaves', 'stories', 'such', 'fluidity', 'really', 'such', 'heart', 'soul', 'giving', 'real', 'reason', 'root', 'men', 'succeed', 'find', 'peace', 'need', 'move', 'March', 'Andrews', 'Russell', 'are', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'roles', ""'m"", 'sad', 'Andrews', 'received', 'awards', 'attention', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'nominated', 'March', 'do', 'think', 'lot', 'Russell', 'win', 'was', 'attributed', 'fact', 'was', 'true', 'war', 'vet', 'acting', 'experience', 'really', 'had', 'lost', 'hands', 'thus', 'served', 'true', 'inspiration', 'thus', 'reason', 'TWO', 'Oscars', 'performance', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'win', 'even', 'Claude', 'Raines', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Even', 'women', 'here', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'really', 'making', 'most', 'roles.Beautifully', 'acted', 'profoundly', 'written', 'directed', 'perfection', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'raw', 'earnest', 'honest', 'truth', 'many', 'films', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'still', 'profound', 'meaningful', 'today', 'hitting', 'great', 'power', 'presence', 'just', 'completely', 'worth', 'single', 'second', 'watch']",The Best Years of Our Lives

In fact, I find it an extremely long movie to watch, almost as long as Ben-Hur, William Wyler's other work. However, The Best Years of Our Lives is the originator of its genre, that is, war veterans returning back to their normal lives. As far as the acting goes, Myrna Loy is the winner for me. I am surprised that she didn't receive at least a nomination. She was sublime and a real woman. Frederic March and Dana Andrews were very good too. Virginia Mayo played her part beautifully well. Harold Russell, the real war vet of any with actual amputated arms, was the bona fide character who happened to win the Oscar (2 of them actually) for his performance. It's so strange, given that fact, he wasn't given the top billing just like everybody else. Is that defined as a discrimination against people with disabilities or what?

In fact, the liner notes point out that he was the first one cast. The script originally had him as a shell-shocked sailor. But then the director and the producer saw a documentary film in which Harold Russell told his story about losing both his hands and learning how to use mechanical hooks instead, and they re-wrote it.Three guys coming home from the war. While arranging transport, they discover that they came from the same home town, the fictional Boone City. So they ride home together, and agree to keep in touch.Al Stephenson (Fredric March) had been an army officer in the war. Before the war he had been a banker, with a posh apartment in a luxury building, a lovely wife (Myrna Loy) and two nice kids. Problem is, the kids grew up while he was away, and he barely knows them. Especially his daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright), who has turned into a lovely and smart and very nice girl.Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) was a bombardier in the Air Force, and was also an officer. But he came from a far more humble background. His father and step-mother live on the ""wrong side of the tracks"" in a place that looks like it wouldn't even keep the rain out. His wife Marie (Virginia Mayo) had been living with them for awhile, but moved out and got her own place, and also got a job in a nightclub.Meanwhile, Homer is worried about how his girlfriend Wilma -- the girl next door he has loved since they were kids -- is going to take his handicapped condition. He's learned to use the hooks pretty darn well, even learns to play the piano with his uncle who runs a tavern, but he's aware of how everyone looks at his hooks, and looks away, and acts all self-conscious around him. He spills a glass of lemonade at Wilma's house the first time he went visiting her folks, and got so self-conscious he went off to His uncle's tavern. And who should show up but Al and Fred. Al has brought his wife and daughter out to ""paint the town,"" and he's stinking drunk. Fred hasn't even found his wife yet, because his father and step-mother don't know which nightclub she works in, so he's been making the rounds. So he's drunk, too. The Stephensons drive him to the apartment house where she supposedly lives, and he rings the bell, but there's no answer. He falls asleep on the doorstep while waiting for his wife to answer the door, so the Stephensons take him home with them. He sleeps in Peggy's room while she sleeps on the couch.By the time Fred finds out his wife was far more interested in his money (the allotment check that arrived every month which was sufficient for her to indulge herself in her cheap way), and that she had ""made a lot of friends"" while he was away, he's already fallen in love with Al's daughter Peggy, and she with him.How all this works out, I will leave the story to tell you. But I'll give away the ending: Fred and Peggy kissing at Homer and Wilma's wedding!",4,"Heartwarming, With Very Good Cast",1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2986,"['quite', 'remarkable', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'disabled', 'veteran', 'was', 'played', 'disabled', 'veteran', 'fact', 'liner', 'notes', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'cast', 'script', 'originally', 'had', 'shell-shocked', 'sailor', 'then', 'director', 'producer', 'saw', 'documentary', 'film', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'told', 'story', 'losing', 'hands', 'learning', 'how', 'use', 'mechanical', 'hooks', 'instead', 're-wrote', 'it.Three', 'guys', 'coming', 'home', 'war', 'arranging', 'transport', 'discover', 'came', 'same', 'home', 'town', 'fictional', 'Boone', 'City', 'ride', 'home', 'together', 'agree', 'keep', 'touch.Al', 'Stephenson', 'Fredric', 'March', 'had', 'been', 'army', 'officer', 'war', 'war', 'had', 'been', 'banker', 'posh', 'apartment', 'luxury', 'building', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'two', 'nice', 'kids', 'Problem', 'kids', 'grew', 'up', 'was', 'away', 'barely', 'Especially', 'daughter', 'Peggy', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'who', 'turned', 'lovely', 'smart', 'very', 'nice', 'girl.Fred', 'Derry', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'was', 'bombardier', 'Air', 'Force', 'was', 'also', 'officer', 'came', 'far', 'more', 'humble', 'background', 'father', 'step-mother', 'live', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'place', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'keep', 'rain', 'out', 'wife', 'Marie', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'awhile', 'moved', 'out', 'got', 'own', 'place', 'also', 'got', 'job', 'nightclub.Meanwhile', 'Homer', 'worried', 'how', 'girlfriend', 'Wilma', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'loved', 'were', 'kids', 'going', 'take', 'handicapped', 'condition', 'learned', 'use', 'hooks', 'pretty', 'darn', 'well', 'even', 'play', 'piano', 'uncle', 'who', 'tavern', 'aware', 'how', 'everyone', 'hooks', 'away', 'self-conscious', 'glass', 'lemonade', 'Wilma', 'house', 'first', 'time', 'went', 'visiting', 'folks', 'got', 'so', 'self-conscious', 'went', 'off', 'uncle', 'tavern', 'who', 'should', 'show', 'up', 'Al', 'Fred', 'Al', 'brought', 'wife', 'daughter', 'paint', 'town', 'stinking', 'drunk', 'Fred', ""n't"", 'even', 'found', 'wife', 'yet', 'father', 'step-mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'been', 'making', 'rounds', 'drunk', 'too', 'Stephensons', 'drive', 'apartment', 'house', 'where', 'supposedly', 'bell', 'answer', 'asleep', 'doorstep', 'waiting', 'wife', 'answer', 'door', 'Stephensons', 'take', 'home', 'Peggy', 'room', 'couch.By', 'time', 'Fred', 'out', 'wife', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'money', 'allotment', 'check', 'arrived', 'month', 'was', 'sufficient', 'indulge', 'cheap', 'way', 'had', 'made', 'lot', 'friends', 'was', 'away', 'already', 'fallen', 'love', 'Al', 'daughter', 'Peggy', 'him.How', 'out', 'will', 'leave', 'story', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'Fred', 'Peggy', 'kissing', 'Homer', 'Wilma', 'wedding']",The Best Years of Our Lives

He is quoted as saying he didn't care if the movie made a nickel, as long as every man, woman, and child in America saw it.  Even the sergeant/banker's son reflects the anti-war, liberal thinking in schools way back then, and the effect it was having on students.  The son, given a couple of war trophies comments on the value the Japanese put on family, then talks about the evils of the atomic bomb.  There are lots of movies from that era that are excellent, but even at that, I find myself wanting to edit some of the dialog.  Not this one.  Perfect.  Start to finish.  The cinematography is also pure art.  Again, congrats to Wyler for the direction and use of extreme depth of field to show two stories in one frame, yet with neither distracting from the other.Only complaint.  The aspect ratio is off.

Fredric March earned a Best Actor Oscar in the role of a banker who served as a sergeant in the infantry and has a drinking problem; his boss and his family are incredibly supportive, yet he just can't stop fighting the war in some ways.  True war casualty Harold Russell, who lost his hands in a training accident, was not a professional actor, yet he creditably portrayed a sailor who can deal with having hooks but can't deal with the way other people treat him as a man with no fingers; he was, after all, essentially portraying himself.  (Mr. Russell is now one of my heroes; he went on after his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this film to form the AMVETS organization.)Dana Andrews portrays the other returning soldier and, while he was the odd man out at award time, his part as the captain flyboy from a poor background is equally well drawn and played.  Turning his whirlwind wartime wedding into a happy marriage to a beautiful blonde (Virgnia Mayo) is just one of the challenges he must face; the others include returning to his humble drugstore job after the glamour of piloting, and the fierce temptation of the attraction he feels to the banker's daughter (Teresa Wright).Seldom does a film from this era (1946) have this kind of depth of characterization and fully fleshed-out situations.

155392,A3G6V756NP65PB,0792846133,Bruce Hutton,"[15, 15]","This is my favorite film of all time, a 3-hour movie I can sit through again and again and find new details and joys I never noticed before. Everybody involved in it, from the director on down, so clearly believed in it that it deserves to be considered not merely a classic but a required film experience for anyone with even one working eye.""The Best Years of Our Lives"" began life as a book-length 1945 poem by MacKinlay Kantor called ""Glory For Me,"" longsince out of print, which I found in Larry McMurtry's fantastical Archer City, Texas bookstore several years ago. The book-poem, sadly, is AWFUL. Pretentious and slow-moving, a good idea gone very bad. The character names are the same, but few other details correspond to the movie, it appears the filmmakers just took the barest interest in Kantor's poem, which is all to the good: Homer, for instance, is not a double amputee in the poem; he has suffered some kind of brain damage and has constant ""spastic"" episodes that render him helpless. I don't know if they changed Homer's disability and then went to find an actor that corresponded, or changed the disablity in order to cast Harold Russell (this might be information gleaned from a DVD extra, if there were any), but regardless the perfect actor found the part and he delivers a performance that is at once tragic and heroic, and he deserved the 2 Oscars he received, as Supporting Actor and as ""an inspiration to wounded veterans everywhere,"" which he certainly was.As is almost always the case with great movies, many other happy accidents happened along the way, such as the casting of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry. As written, Derry is about 24, considerably younger than Andrews was, but he is SO GOOD in this part that you never notice, or care. Many actors give career-best performances here, certainly the devilishly gorgeous Virginia Mayo, almost always a ""nice"" girl in her other roles, but here she chews the scenery in the small apartment she shares with Andrews and you find yourself wishing she'd been a bigger star. Frederic March and Myrna Loy gave so many excellent performances in their long careers that it's hard to single out any one part, but there's no denying the realism and power they bring to this portrait of a middle-aged married couple finding each other again after a distance of years and thousands of miles through the long ""great"" war. March's slide into alcoholism toward the end of the film signals another hallmark of the survivors of the 1940's, and for a kind of unofficial sequel to this film I highly recommend ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit,"" both the movie and the book by Sloan Wilson, to see what happened further down the road.At any rate this is a great film, and the long scenes detailing the three veterans' first day home from the war is so good it could almost be a movie all by itself. Coming home at last, something they dreamed about for months and years while they were off fighting, high expectations gone almost instantly awry, colliding with the reality of returning to a world that moved on without them while they were away. The movie is about how each of these three men (and, in a phrase oft used at the time, the women who love them) come to grips with the new lives they have to live after the cataclysm they've survived, how they triumph or fall victim like their lost comrades on the battlefield. The world we live in today is in large part a product of men like these, and it's good that we have a movie like this to honor them and their sacrifices. They aren't ""the greatest generation"" simply because they fought in the war, but also because they continued to fight when they got home to give their children more than they had, to be safe from Depression and world war and the rest of what they had to face. Their need for safety and security led directly to their children becoming rebels and hippies twenty years later, but that's another story. This movie is about them, and it's a movie as fascinating and interesting as they themselves are. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" isn't a historical artifact like an old shoebox full of rusty medals and yellowed love letters, it's a living, breathing, fully entertaining monument to a time and a generation that are as important to us today as they ever were.

155396,A282A0P69UT137,0792846133,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[115, 117]","""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a compelling dramatic masterpiece, and certainly one of the best films ever made.  It's not as well known today as other pieces from the period, such as ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"", but it is nevertheless a classic that deserves ranking with those same films.This film paints a picture of the struggles of World War II servicemen that they faced AFTER the war was over.  It was a more personal struggle of men returning home after being away for many years, and after experiencing horrors that their loved ones could never fully understand.  They return home as changed people, and come home to changed lives.The story of such a homecoming experienced by thousands of men after World War II is told from the perspective of three fictional characters: Captain Fred Derry, a bombadier in the Army Air Corps (Dana Andrews), Sergeant Al Stevenson, an Army infantryman (Frederich March), and Seamen Homer Parrish(Harold Russell).  They happen to meet on the plane to their hometown, having never met before, and immediately form a bond built upon mutual understanding of the experiences of war and the anxieties of returning home again.Captain Derry came from a poor background before the war, and married a blond bombshell (Virgnia Mayo) while in the Air Corps.  He hopes to return home to a better life, a nice home with his wife, and a better job.  This was not to be, as Derry struggles to try and deal with bad job prospects (no one in the civilian world needs a bombadier) and a cheating wife.  In a poignant moment in the film, Derry (at his lowest) tells his Father to throw away the citations for his medals, because ""they don't mean anything"".  His Father reads the one for the Distinguished Flying Cross, signed by General Jimmy Doolittle, and a look of pride comes over the old man's face for his son's heroism that makes you want to cry and cheer all at the same time.  It also makes the viewer see how criminal it was for such a man to be made to feel worthless.Sergeant Stevenson comes home to better circumstances, being a banker in the civilian world with a wife, two grown children, and a nice apartment.  But he too must confront troubles, as Stevenson must get to know a family that progressed without him, and balance his job with his desire to aid servicemen seeking G.I. Bill loans.  He battles with his bank's bosses over the loan issue, and also struggles with alcoholism.Seamen Parrish's problems are the most obvious.  He lost his hands during the war, and now must come home to his family and fiancee with hooks for hands.  The actor who potrayed Parrish, Harold Russell, was a real disable veteran, and lends credibility to the role that no one else could have due to real life experience.This may seem like a depressing film, but it is actually uplifting in its entirety because it does show that hope doesn't die, and that you really can come home again after all.  It is also a film of historical importance due to the insights it provides into post-World War II America, and the struggles of veterans in the post-war years.  Captain Derry, Sergeant Stevenson, and Seamen Parrish, and their individual struggles to reclaim their lives can provide the student of history an important perspective on the many real life veterans who returned home, and the country of the time they returned home to.The film has certainly earned accolades over the years.  It won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1946. It was named by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 Best Movies ever made, and was also named as one of the most important films of all time by the National Archives for the National Film Registry.""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is not to be missed for both its dramatic poignancy and its insight into an important period of American History.

Davis,"[13, 13]","""The Best Years of Our Lives"" aired every Decoration Day - or Memorial Day as it is called in most of the U S - on one of the three TV stations that was available in my small hometown in rural Arkansas.  Memorial Day is a day dedicated to the dead, it would have been better to have aired this movie on Veteran's Day - the day dedicated to the survivors of war.Fundamentally, this is a tale about war survivors.  The pain that they bear in missing limbs, broken hearts, and lost dreams is the real story.  As the movie starts, we see three veterans returning to their hometown.  These are three men with nothing in common other than their service.  They each have been touched by the war and are trying to find a new way forward.Homer Parrish (real-life double amputee Harold Russell) of the Navy is the one who bears the physical effects of the war.  Of note, Harold Russell lost his hands in a training accident when he was in the Army Airborne.  He never saw combat and spent the war providing training to other amputees on how to use prosthetics.  In fact, his role in such a training movie talking about how to use prosthetics resulted in him earning this role.  In many ways, Homer has the easiest transition.  He has a wonderful family waiting for him.  He receives generous veterans and disability benefits.  However, he doesn't know how to react to how others react to his disability.  In the end, he shows his girlfriend just how helpless he really is, when she reacts with kindness and love, the journey to happiness can begin.Al (Fredric March), the sergeant, is a well-to-do bank executive.  He has the most difficult transition.  First, his children grew up while he was gone.  He finds a daughter is a young woman and a son who is smarter and more observant than his father - at least in terms of science and politics if not human behavior.  Additionally, he finds that he has become what we today would call an adrenaline junkie.  Without the constant excitement in war, he finds that he needs alcohol and constant involvement from his family.  Additionally, years of making snap judgments in combat have made him a little more impulsive than his bank might enjoy.  Al has one of the best stories about not taking a hill and losing the war that I've ever heard.Air Force Captain Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), a soda jerk, is a man who married a girl he hardly knew two weeks before he left for war.  He returns to find his wife did not share any allotment money with his dirt poor family.  He also finds that she has been somewhat less than the perfect wife.  War was a chance for this handsome, charming man to become a natural leader.  Peace has a dead end job and a loveless marriage.  To my mind, Fred is a lot like the folks from my part of rural Arkansas who lived in a more equitable and opportunity filled world when in combat than existed when they returned home at the end of their service.There is a lot of star quality in this movie.  Either you will recognize the names or you won't, but the script obviously attracted big names to take bit parts.The title is very meaningful.  What were the best years of these men's lives?

Three perspectives are bundled together - the rich man who's come to know the working-class man as his brother in arms, the poor man whose army glory far outshines his pedestrian civilian life, and the disabled veteran who must come to grips with his limitations.  Each man is given greatest respect, presented to the audience as a noble warrior returned home with a new perspective on who they are and what they want from their lives.Idealistic, over-simplified?  Sure.  But what's being conveyed through the film isn't intended to be the harsh reality of soldiers and sailors adjusting to life after war.

155402,A23GKYLTD8UASL,0792846133,Celia Trujillo,"[3, 3]","I absolutely LOVE this film!  My father is a WWII veteran.  I think of him and his peers when I view this movie.  So many aspects of coming home from war are touched upon in this film.  When I see it, I wonder sometimes if we have really changed so much.Here is why I say this...The soldier longs for home, for his family, for his girl.  And then when the day finally arrives that he is actually going home, the uncertainty sets in.  I know I've changed.  Will my family understand this?  What will they think of me?  Will I be able to relate to them?  Or the soldier who suffered the loss of his hands.  How will people treat me?  Will I be able to function as a man and provide for my family?  Or will people feel sorry for me/pity me?  The soldier who comes home only to find that his wife has moved on.  That she is selfish, only thinking of herself and the next good time.  The realization that the relationship was superficial from the beginning.  That just when he needs support the most, it is not there.As well, the family who waits for the returning soldier.  They have been dreaming of this day for a long time.  But when he finally is home, he is somewhat like a stranger.  They know that he has been through experiences that they will never fully understand.  The wife's desire for things to ""get back to normal.""  The reality that things can and never will completely be the same.  The returning father who tries to relate to his children.  He remembers as they were when he left, but they have grown up now.  They can't fully relate to what their father has been through. Then there is the ""cluelessness"" of the folks in the community who wonder where the soldier has been all this time.  They have no understanding of what the soldier has been through or how they have changed...nor do they want to hear much about it.The performances in this film are stellar and the musical soundtrack really captures the heart of the film.  One of the most telling scenes is when Dana Andrews (who played a former tail gunner) climbs into a junked bomber parked in a field.  As he looks out the dirty windshield with the sweat running down his face, he starts to imagine, once again, that he is in the heat of battle.  The music reaches a crescendo that transports us into the battle with the loud and unwavering hum of the bombers as they enter a dangerous confrontation with the enemy.  The fact that an actual veteran, played by Harold Russell, with a real disability is in the movie helps make it the classic that is truly is.  He was basically untrained as an actor, which contributes to the everyman appeal of this film.  You couldn't ask for a better cast in this film, Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Virginia Mayo, Teresa Wright, Cathy O'Donnell, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell.I hope that MGM, or whoever the distributor is, will come out with a fully restored version and a documentary that talks about the making of and legacy of this wonderful film.",5,Have Things Really Changed So Much?,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2961,"['absolutely', 'LOVE', 'film', 'father', 'WWII', 'veteran', 'think', 'peers', 'when', 'view', 'movie', 'So', 'many', 'aspects', 'coming', 'home', 'war', 'are', 'touched', 'film', 'When', 'see', 'wonder', 'sometimes', 'have', 'really', 'changed', 'so', 'much.Here', 'why', 'say', 'soldier', 'longs', 'home', 'family', 'girl', 'then', 'when', 'day', 'finally', 'actually', 'going', 'home', 'uncertainty', 'sets', 'know', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'Will', 'family', 'understand', 'What', 'will', 'think', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'soldier', 'who', 'suffered', 'loss', 'hands', 'How', 'will', 'people', 'treat', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'function', 'man', 'provide', 'family', 'will', 'people', 'feel', 'sorry', 'me/pity', 'soldier', 'who', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'wife', 'moved', 'selfish', 'only', 'thinking', 'herself', 'next', 'good', 'time', 'realization', 'relationship', 'was', 'superficial', 'beginning', 'just', 'when', 'support', 'most', 'not', 'there.As', 'well', 'family', 'who', 'returning', 'soldier', 'have', 'been', 'dreaming', 'day', 'long', 'time', 'when', 'finally', 'home', 'somewhat', 'stranger', 'know', 'been', 'experiences', 'will', 'never', 'fully', 'understand', 'wife', 'desire', 'things', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'reality', 'things', 'can', 'never', 'will', 'completely', 'be', 'same', 'returning', 'father', 'who', 'relate', 'children', 'were', 'when', 'left', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fully', 'relate', 'what', 'father', 'been', 'Then', 'cluelessness', 'folks', 'community', 'who', 'wonder', 'where', 'soldier', 'been', 'time', 'have', 'understanding', 'what', 'soldier', 'been', 'how', 'have', 'changed', 'do', 'want', 'hear', 'much', 'it.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'stellar', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'heart', 'film', 'One', 'most', 'telling', 'scenes', 'when', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'who', 'played', 'former', 'tail', 'gunner', 'junked', 'bomber', 'parked', 'field', 'out', 'dirty', 'windshield', 'sweat', 'running', 'down', 'face', 'imagine', 'once', 'again', 'heat', 'battle', 'music', 'crescendo', 'battle', 'loud', 'unwavering', 'hum', 'bombers', 'enter', 'dangerous', 'confrontation', 'enemy', 'fact', 'actual', 'veteran', 'played', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'real', 'disability', 'movie', 'make', 'classic', 'truly', 'was', 'basically', 'untrained', 'actor', 'everyman', 'appeal', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'cast', 'film', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'Cathy', ""O'Donnell"", 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Harold', 'Russell.I', 'hope', 'MGM', 'distributor', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'fully', 'restored', 'version', 'documentary', 'making', 'legacy', 'wonderful', 'film']",The Best Years of Our Lives

At the time, it dealt very honestly and realistically with issues of war veterans returning home, and the adjustments their families and relatives have to make.  There is the war veteran who returns home with hooks for his hands, there is mention of PTSD, of the inevitable divorces, of difficulty finding work in the postwar economy.But what makes this such a great movie is that it is a story of love and hope.There are three love stories in this movie, all in different stages of evolution.One is a long standing established marriage - the Myrna Loy and Fredric March characters are a  middle aged couple who thoroughly understand and still deeply love one another.  They fit together like spoons in a drawer.  Dare we use the word soulmates here?In the characters of Harold Russell, the real-life injured veteran, and his girlfriend, played by Cathy O'Donnell, is the classic relationship of the girl-next-door, childhood sweetheart.  Russell, the only non-professional actor, is a bit stiff and awkward in his relationship with his girlfriend, and one senses a lack of chemistry here, despite the beautiful Cathy O'Donnell's best efforts at playing the dutiful and faithful girlfriend.  Russell did win two Oscars for this role, the only time that has happened in Oscar history.The best love story is that of the characters of Dana Andrews and the lovely Theresa Wright.  First, though, the Dana Andrews character, coming from a humble background, loses his gold digger wife, who divorces him after he loses his job.  Wright's character is thoroughly well-bred, independant, and intelligent, having been raised in comfortable upper-middle class surroundings.

155413,A3D5CVFNIYQCSI,0792846133,David,"[6, 6]","I have the HBO version of this film on DVD (now out of print), so I can't comment on the transfer quality of this MGM/UA disk, but I can comment on the quality of the movie.My Amazon review will be number 48 for this film, yet it still retains an average 5-star rating! That's remarkable, but not surpirsing. Simply put, this film has been my favorite since the first time I saw it, about 20 years ago. It has aired almost too much in recent years due to cable TV channels like TCM, but before that it was hard to find, for some reason not clear to me, so the film was a mystery to me. However, I had seen it listed as the Academy Award winner as Best Film for 1946, so I was curious about it. Based on thumbnail reviews I had read, I had some notion of what it might be like, mostly because of my experiences with other B&amp;W movies of the 1940s, but my expectations were dead wrong. This film is totally unique in its flavor and character, due in no small part to the talents and artistic vision of William Wyler, the great cast, the great story, and the timing of its theatrical release. Coming so quickly after the end of the War, the experiences of the characters on screen exactly duplicated the experiences of real Americans at that moment in our history. As another reviewer has speculated, it must have had an extremely powerful effect on the audiences of that day. It's still a memorable film-viewing experience now, 55 years later.I won't get into the story line, because others have done that well enough. Actually, if you break the plot skeleton down into its elements it's probably not much different from other dramas of its type. What sets this movie miles apart is the very high quality of its production, and the way all of its elements merge together into a nearly perfect whole: First, the stirring music in the opening titles. Then the beautiful black and white photography, beginning with a lone soldier (Dana Andrews) looking already somewhat out of place in a bustling modern airport. The wonderful cross country ride in the nose of a B-17 as the three returning veterans get a bird's eye view of the land they fought to save (one of them losing his hands in the process). The taxi ride down Main Street in their home town -- the most compelling tidbit of nostalgia I've ever seen on film, and an honest peek into a bright, optimistic world that is long gone. Later, the difficulty in readjusting to civilian life, each of the three veterans with his own special problems.For older viewers, this film is an almost overwhelming nostalgia trip. For younger viewers, it's an engaging drama and a truthful history lesson about who we as Americans are and where we've come from. I was a small child when this was made, but I can still remember the flavor of those post-War years. No, it wasn't a perfect world. In some ways it was very much like the one we live in now, but unless you were there, you can't imagine the impact that humongous war had on people's lives for at least a decade afterwards. &quot;The War,&quot; though in past tense, was involved in some way with almost everything you heard about. In fact, when Korea blew up in 1950, that conflict had a hard time being taken seriously because of the still very powerful lingering effects and memories of the recent &quot;big one.&quot;As I mentioned before, The Best Years of our Lives has only been readily available for viewing, either on TV or personal video, for the past ten or 15 years, and that's also true now of a lot of the great films (luckily for us!). This movie is an emotional one with an emotional appeal, so it's no surprise that it moves up and down in the &quot;top 100&quot; lists. A while back, in the early '90s, it was in the top five. Lately it's in the top 70 or so. The people who make these lists are fickle, and so the lists take you on a roller coaster ride over the years, but these things always seem to come full circle in due time.I still remember, about ten years ago a top radio and TV talk show host announced that he had seen The Best Years of Our Lives the night before. In hushed, almost reverent tones he continued: &quot;It is absolutely the greatest film I have ever seen!&quot;What can I add to that? I absolutely agree!",5,"My all-time favorite, without a doubt",999993600,"09 9, 2001",2001,4247,"['have', 'HBO', 'version', 'film', 'DVD', 'now', 'print', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'transfer', 'quality', 'MGM/UA', 'disk', 'can', 'comment', 'quality', 'movie.My', 'Amazon', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'number', '48', 'film', 'still', 'average', '5-star', 'rating', 'remarkable', 'not', 'surpirsing', 'Simply', 'put', 'film', 'been', 'favorite', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'about', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'aired', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'recent', 'years', 'due', 'cable', 'TV', 'channels', 'TCM', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'reason', 'not', 'clear', 'film', 'was', 'mystery', 'However', 'had', 'seen', 'listed', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Best', 'Film', '1946', 'was', 'curious', 'Based', 'thumbnail', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'had', 'notion', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'mostly', 'experiences', 'other', 'B', 'amp', 'W', 'movies', '1940s', 'expectations', 'were', 'dead', 'wrong', 'film', 'totally', 'unique', 'flavor', 'character', 'due', 'small', 'part', 'talents', 'artistic', 'vision', 'William', 'Wyler', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'story', 'timing', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Coming', 'so', 'quickly', 'end', 'War', 'experiences', 'characters', 'screen', 'exactly', 'duplicated', 'experiences', 'real', 'Americans', 'moment', 'history', 'reviewer', 'speculated', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'effect', 'audiences', 'day', 'still', 'memorable', 'film-viewing', 'experience', 'now', '55', 'years', 'later.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'story', 'line', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'Actually', 'break', 'plot', 'skeleton', 'down', 'elements', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'other', 'dramas', 'type', 'What', 'movie', 'miles', 'apart', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'way', 'elements', 'merge', 'together', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'whole', 'First', 'stirring', 'music', 'opening', 'titles', 'Then', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'beginning', 'lone', 'soldier', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'looking', 'already', 'somewhat', 'place', 'bustling', 'modern', 'airport', 'wonderful', 'cross', 'country', 'ride', 'nose', 'B-17', 'three', 'returning', 'veterans', 'get', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'land', 'fought', 'save', 'one', 'losing', 'hands', 'process', 'taxi', 'ride', 'down', 'Main', 'Street', 'home', 'town', 'most', 'compelling', 'tidbit', 'nostalgia', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'honest', 'peek', 'bright', 'optimistic', 'world', 'long', 'gone', 'Later', 'difficulty', 'readjusting', 'civilian', 'life', 'three', 'veterans', 'own', 'special', 'problems.For', 'older', 'viewers', 'film', 'almost', 'overwhelming', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'younger', 'viewers', 'engaging', 'drama', 'truthful', 'history', 'lesson', 'who', 'Americans', 'are', 'where', ""'ve"", 'come', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'flavor', 'post-War', 'years', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'world', 'ways', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'live', 'now', 'were', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'impact', 'humongous', 'war', 'had', 'people', 'lives', 'least', 'decade', 'afterwards', 'quot', 'War', 'quot', 'past', 'tense', 'was', 'involved', 'way', 'almost', 'everything', 'heard', 'fact', 'when', 'Korea', 'blew', 'up', '1950', 'conflict', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'being', 'taken', 'seriously', 'still', 'very', 'powerful', 'lingering', 'effects', 'memories', 'recent', 'quot', 'big', 'one.', 'quot', 'mentioned', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'only', 'been', 'readily', 'available', 'viewing', 'either', 'TV', 'personal', 'video', 'past', 'ten', '15', 'years', 'also', 'true', 'now', 'lot', 'great', 'films', 'luckily', 'movie', 'emotional', 'one', 'emotional', 'appeal', 'surprise', 'up', 'down', 'quot', '100', 'quot', 'lists', 'while', 'back', 'early', ""'90s"", 'was', 'top', 'five', 'Lately', 'top', '70', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'lists', 'are', 'fickle', 'so', 'lists', 'take', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'years', 'things', 'always', 'seem', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'due', 'time.I', 'still', 'remember', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'top', 'radio', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'announced', 'had', 'seen', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'night', 'before', 'hushed', 'almost', 'reverent', 'tones', 'continued', 'quot', 'absolutely', 'greatest', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'quot', 'What', 'can', 'add', 'absolutely', 'agree']",The Best Years of Our Lives
155414,A35UNON2GI8C0R,0792846133,David Kusumoto,"[14, 15]","** BLU-RAY UPDATE:  The November 2013 Blu-ray issue of this title is a MAJOR UPGRADE from the DVD re-issue from January 2013.  (See notes about that DVD below).  Dirt, scratches and other debris have been digitally removed and the film now looks and sounds (DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0) gorgeous.  The moment the opening credits roll, you know you're about to see the sharpest transfer of ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" ever released on home video.  Keep in mind, however, that there's still some graininess present - which is common with vintage movies given the Blu-ray treatment - and I do not consider this a defect.  While original negatives of old films never have the sharpness of movies shot today with high-resolution cameras, I'm not a fan of digital noise reduction - which removes details from each frame.  All special features from the January 2013 DVD re-issue are also on this Blu-ray, with subtitles available on everything except the theatrical trailer.  The 1995 interviews with Virginia Mayo and Teresa Wright were shot on video tape hence are NOT in high resolution - nor is the theatrical trailer, which is still ragged and has not been cleaned.  Still, in my view, the November 2013 Blu-ray is now the ""gold standard"" for this title.  Note also that this film is presented in its original 1:37:1 semi-square aspect ratio format.  Like ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Casablanca"" and other Golden Age classics, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was NEVER shot with wide screen cameras.** DVD UPDATE:  The January 2013 re-issue DVD offers NO improvement in picture or sound quality from previous DVD releases (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo).  Beyond cosmetic changes to the box - this edition brings back the 1995 interviews with Virginia Mayo and Teresa Wright that were on the 1997 HBO Video DVD release of this film - and improves the look of the English subtitles - which were all left off the MGM DVD release in 2000.  The January 2013 DVD release is a ""must"" ONLY if you want everything previously released - on one disc.  Remember, the 1997 HBO Video issue was a ""flipper"" - part 1 of the movie and special features were on side one, part 2 of the movie was on side two.  The 2000 MGM issue had NO English subtitles and NO special features other than an old trailer.  The January 2013 issue has the entire movie, subtitles and all the aforementioned special features on one side of the disc, with ""no flipping"" required.===============================ORIGINAL CONTENT REVIEW BELOW.===============================* Just before legendary director William Wyler died, equally legendary director Billy Wilder was interviewed about his feelings about Wyler's films, from ""Best Years of Our Lives"" to ""Roman Holiday"" to ""Ben Hur"" to ""Funny Girl.""* Wilder, a tough man who hated schmaltz and sentiment, the director of such classics as ""Some Like it Hot,"" ""The Apartment,"" ""The Seven Year Itch"" and ""Sunset Boulevard,"" suddenly got emotional, expressing great affection for ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" noting that it was one of the best films he had ever seen.* He reacted the way I reacted. He said that it was the only film that he could remember where he and the entire audience were drenched in tears within the first 10 minutes. It was an unforgettable experience for him, and he recognized immediately that ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was obviously a deeply personal work for Wyler, where every scene, every frame, every note of music and word of dialogue, rang true with authenticity and emotion. This was Wyler's territory. He knew the material. And many of the scenes that were shot mirrored his own experiences when he returned home from war.* This is why, after so many viewings, I still can't get over the fact that no matter how many times I say to myself, ""I'm not going to be moved by this or that scene,"" I fail miserably. I just can't help it. To say that this is a great film is an understatement of the highest order. And yet I can only count on one hand the number of friends I know who have seen this film from start to finish. I think the running length has something to do with it. You never see it on commercial television at all and unless you're lucky enough to have cable, you'll miss it entirely. And it's not a film that people are banging down the doors to rent.* The wonderful thing about ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is that it still holds up beautifully, unlike a lot of films that seem awkward or stilted. Fredric March, as the patriarch of the family (in an Oscar winning role), is stupendous. His acting and delivery of lines seems effortless and spontaneous, not the product of a script recited from memory. And to have Myrna Loy as his partner and the wonderful Teresa Wright playing his daughter (the latter an Oscar winner a few years earlier in ""Mrs. Miniver""), how can you lose?* Like all great films, time has no meaning. The story sweeps you along like a great wave -- a ride -- that you never want to end. The famous ""long hallway homecoming shot"" that appears in the first 10 minutes of the film -- I don't care that it's the scene that most people remember and is usually the ONLY scene that turns up in any highlight reel of greatest films ever made -- it gets me every time.* And the ending, the last line from the movie, the one uttered by Dana Andrews -- despite the sentimental setting -- is so fabulously understated and cynical and yet filled with such hope, that you can't help but be -- what I describe as being -- ""happily devastated."" It's a wonderful ending that purposely leaves you guessing about what will become of the characters played by Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews, but you can't help but feel that their future looks bright in spite of their apparent state of destitution.* I just wish more people would see this film. There's a treasure chest of great movies from the past that people overlook every day. This is one of them. I pity people who still buy or rent movies based on slick packaging alone.* I would rather pay $10 to see this film on the big screen or less than $20 to own this film so I can see it on a little screen -- than pay about $4 to rent junk that has a good looking box -- and a few great critical reviews from people you've never heard of.* Some films are good enough to rent, but only a few films are good enough to buy. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a film to BUY.",5,Billy Wilder said it best...,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,6365,"['**', 'BLU-RAY', 'UPDATE', 'November', '2013', 'Blu-ray', 'issue', 'title',

155416,A2JXAQ92WYPAAR,0792846133,"David Schweizer ""Almawood""","[3, 3]","One of the best of the post-war American classics, perhaps the best until Coppola's ""The Godfather."" The film is as serious as they get, but there is a lot of ""The Thin Man"" kind of 1930's humor in the bedroom scenes, particularly between the married couple, played by Myrna Loy and Fredrick March. The humor does a lot to balance what is the somber theme of the returning soldiers whose lives will never be the same. The cast is superb, of course, topping the list is Myrna Loy, whom I adore, and Dana Andrews, a leading man type whom, with the coming of James Dean and company, history left behind. The film, however, had enormous influence on the shaping of the post-war hero who never again is all good and all pure. From then on, as with these three heroes, the good guys are only good part of the time. Think of ""Shane,"" for example, and all the post-war Western heroes: they too are twitchy, nervous, with something in their pasts that's eating at them. Dana Andrews can't sleep; this vulnerability is key to the shaping of the new hero type. He is damaged goods, and that's what makes him attractive to the ladies. Actually, that's what makes all post-war men attractive, that is, their suffering, not their heroics. The film lays the groundwork for all this, exposing the underbelly of the hero-myth.

It is one of my favorites.But I'm not writing this review to gush about the film itself.  Many people have already done that here and quite a few have done a better job than I can do.  I am writing this to (hopefully) clear up some confusion about which DVD version to buy.There were a few negative comments about the film itself, but those people are probably the kind of morons who think an interesting film has to have car chases and lots of explosions.  I guess we should feel sorry for them and their pathetic lives.Virtually all of the other negative comments were praising the film but grousing about the quality of the DVD transfer.  The contrast was low (muddy grays instead of blacks and whites) and excessive noise on the video and audio.  But, strangely enough, others were saying that their DVD was fine.  All of the reviews about this movie were lumped together, but none of these reviewers mentioned exactly which version they were writing about.A number of people (including myself) wanted to purchase this film, but we did not know which one to order.  It turns out that my local library had a copy on hand, so I checked it out this morning.  We didn't have time to watch the entire film, but we did jump to various chapters to see how it looked.Apparently, we found the good version.  The blacks were black, the whites were white, and there were many shades of gray in between.  There was a little noise at the beginning during the opening credits, but otherwise the transfer was surprising clean for a movie that's over 60-years old.And now (drum roll please) the copy to buy is:The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)* Studio: MGM (Video & DVD)* DVD Release Date: July 18, 2000* ASIN: 0792846133It's the one with the red cover and the MGM logo at the top.This is the version Amazon is currently selling and they have a great price.

155426,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,0792846133,Donald M. Bishop,"[5, 5]","Many viewers of this great American movie -- it won seven Oscars, including Best Picture, for 1946 -- are unaware that it was based on a most unusual book-length narrative poem by MacKinlay Kantor, ""Glory for Me,"" published in 1945.In 1970, I was a lieutenant working at the Air Force Historical Research Center. The older historians told a word-of-mouth story how the book and the movie came to be. No doubt the story had been embroidered over many years of retelling, but here's the way I heard it.In 1944, movie titan Samuel Goldwyn knew that whether the allied victory in World War II would come sooner, or later, millions of American veterans would return home. Many -- especially those with physical and psychological wounds -- would have trouble finding jobs and ""readjusting.""Goldwyn knew that journalist and playwright MacKinlay Kantor, who had flown missions with the 305th Bomb Group from England earlier in the war, had gotten to know American servicemen in combat at first hand. Goldwyn asked Kantor to write a screenplay for a planned movie on the veterans returning home.According to the story, Kantor had driven up to a Tennessee mountain retreat to work on the screenplay. He took his typewriter and a case of bourbon. He emerged some months later with empty bottles and ""Glory for Me,"" written in the form of a narrative poem, not a screenplay. Goldwyn was not pleased, and he eventually gave Kantor's poem to Robert Sherwood to reshape for the screen. When the film finally appeared, Kantor was given a minimum of credit. Sherwood -- deservedly -- won the Oscar for Best Writing.If you like the movie, you will be richly rewarded by reading the poem.Kantor's and Sherwood's treatments of the same characters and the same American town (""Boone City"") shows two gifted men working the same basic story in different literary forms, poem and screenplay. Reading the book allows one to discover how, here and there, they made some different creative choices.In Kantor's poem, Homer's disability is spasticity, which makes for some painful reading. Sherwood gave Homer a physical disability -- loss of hands and the use of prosthetic hooks. Sherwood's choice was a wise one for the moviegoing public, and few are the hearts not moved by Harold Phillips' portrayal of Homer in the film. But Kantor's portrayal of Homer and his girl Wilma are equally moving, perhaps because the poem gave more room for character development.When Frederic March played Al Stephenson -- the older sergeant returning to his prewar life as a banker at the Cornbelt Trust Company -- he masterfully compressed much of Kantor's material in eloquent but short scenes. In Kantor's fuller telling of the story, Al was the son of a pioneer banker who had made loans to farmers a generation earlier. The poem has more social and historical texture.In Kantor's poem, Homer's uncle Butch (Hoagy Carmichael's character in the movie) provides a vehicle to explore class feelings in pre- and post-war America. This was one of Kantor's themes that Sherwood could not fit into the film. Similarly, Kantor told his readers more about Novak (the veteran asking for a loan to open a nursery) and his experiences as a Seabee in the Pacific. Kantor's use of lilacs as a metaphor for peace and normality could not be picked up in the film.On the other hand, Sherwood changed the story line to say more about wartime marriages. Marie (Virginia Mayo in the film) proves shallow and unfaithful when Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns home. The movie's title, not found in Kantor's poem, came from a scene when the two argued.The book was published in January, 1945, months before the war ended. Kantor well anticipated the major contours of veteran adjustment, but there was more to his foresight. On the final page of the poem he showed real prescience when he alluded to the unresolved social tensions that all Americans, not just the veterans, would confront in the coming years.Reading habits have changed in the six decades since the book was published, and readers may now find that it takes some pages to adjust to the poetic form. Kantor's poetic shortcomings earned some dismissive reviews. Poems similar in form by Kantor's contemporaries like Stephen Vincent Benet are now dismissed as middlebrow when they are read at all. I am confident, though, that with each page the reader will find new lines and new scenes to savor and treasure.""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a truly great American movie. ""Glory for Me"" deserves equal recognition. Kantor recognized the coming drama of the returning veterans. He dignified their individual struggles in a literary form that recalled the great epics and placed the American veterans among mankind's heroes. He gave an immortal film -- a film that affected tens of millions -- its basic structure, plot, characters, tone, and feeling.Not a bad result for a few months of solitude with a case of bourbon.-30-",5,"Before the movie, before the screenplay, a book-length poem",1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,4926,"['Many', 'viewers', 'great', 'American', 'movie', 'won', 'seven', 'Oscars',

155432,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0792846133,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 8]","With the recent deaths of Teresa Wright and Virginia Mayo, it gives a compelling reason to revisit one of the finest of American films, a deserved classic that focuses on the challenges faced by returning WWII veterans. Directed by William Wyler, a master at capturing the spectrum of human behavior no matter the size of his canvas, this poignant 1946 film focuses on three men, all affected deeply by their wartime experiences. Ostensibly a period piece, the film's emotionalism continues to resonate and even takes on a burnished quality because of its uncommon honesty during a time that could have easily been made rose-colored by the Hollywood studio system.As the oldest of the trio, Fredric March portrays Al Stephenson, an Army sergeant, who comes home to his picture-perfect family - a loyal wife (Myrna Loy in her typical role) and two well-adjusted children. Even with such an idyllic life awaiting him, he becomes conflicted about how life has changed during his absence from the home front. Perhaps released too soon after Billy Wilder's blistering classic about alcoholism, ""The Lost Weekend"", the film dances around Al's heavy drinking which could have been an interesting angle to explore. Although March won his second Oscar for this role, I feel the film's most impressive performance actually comes from Dana Andrews, who plays Air Force bombardier Fred Derry caught between a loveless marriage to good-time gal Marie (Mayo) and a growing attraction toward Peggy, Al's fresh-scrubbed daughter (Wright). The third man is sailor Homer Parrish, portrayed in an honest, unaffected manner by real-life double amputee Harold Russell. Although it looks like the movie will focus primarily on Al's situation, Wyler cleverly shifts the story to Fred in the second half since he is the one who faces the most uncertain future. Homer's story is interspersed throughout. But what brings the film together is the palpable sense of disquiet experienced by all three in trying to assimilate into their former lives. Homer has the most obvious challenge as he faces others' discomfort in handling his disability. There is a heartbreaking scene where Russell smashes his artificial hooks through a window out of sheer frustration and terrifies his young sister to plead for forgiveness.  But the most powerful scenes belong to Andrews who faces the humiliation of going back to his pre-war soda jerk job, then slowly realizes how superficial his wife is and what he must do to build his life again, perfectly symbolized by his halting walk through a massive, desolate graveyard of junked WWII airplanes.The irony of the movie's title refers to the irretrievable fact that many servicemen experienced their best years in wartime, not in conforming their lives to peacetime as they get reacquainted with their loved ones.  It's a significant distinction treated gently by Wyler and screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood. The almost-three-hour running time goes by quickly, as one feels a true sense of empathy for all the characters, even Mayo's floozy who has more under the surface than one would suspect. Special mention needs to be given to Cathy O'Donnell's touching performance as Wilma, Homer's innocent and accepting fianc&eacute;e.  Sterling work from a bygone era.",5,Not a Single False Note in Deserved Post-WWII Classic,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,3269,"['recent', 'deaths', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'compelling', 'reason', 'revisit', 'one', 'finest', 'American', 'films', 'deserved', 'classic', 'challenges', 'faced', 'returning', 'WWII', 'veterans', 'Directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'master', 'capturing', 'spectrum', 'human', 'behavior', 'matter', 'size', 'canvas', 'poignant', '1946', 'film', 'focuses', 'three', 'men', 'affected', 'deeply', 'wartime', 'experiences', 'Ostensibly', 'period', 'piece', 'film', 'emotionalism', 'resonate', 'even', 'burnished', 'quality', 'uncommon', 'honesty', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'made', 'rose-colored', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'system.As', 'oldest', 'trio', 'Fredric', 'March', 'Al', 'Stephenson', 'Army', 'sergeant', 'who', 'home', 'picture-perfect', 'family', 'loyal', 'wife', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'typical', 'role', 'two', 'well-adjusted', 'children', 'Even', 'idyllic', 'life', 'awaiting', 'conflicted', 'how', 'life', 'changed', 'absence', 'home', 'front', 'Perhaps', 'released', 'too', 'soon', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'blistering', 'classic', 'alcoholism', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'film', 'dances', 'Al', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'angle', 'explore', 'March', 'won', 'second', 'Oscar', 'role', 'feel', 'film', 'most', 'impressive', 'performance', 'actually', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'who', 'Air', 'Force', 'bombardier', 'Fred', 'Derry', 'caught', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'good-time', 'gal', 'Marie', 'Mayo', 'growing', 'attraction', 'Peggy', 'Al', 'fresh-scrubbed', 'daughter', 'Wright', 'third', 'man', 'sailor', 'Homer', 'Parrish', 'portrayed', 'honest', 'unaffected', 'manner', 'real-life', 'double', 'amputee', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'movie', 'will', 'focus', 'primarily', 'Al', 'situation', 'Wyler', 'cleverly', 'shifts', 'story', 'Fred', 'second', 'half', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'uncertain', 'future', 'Homer', 'story', 'interspersed', 'what', 'film', 'together', 'palpable', 'sense', 'disquiet', 'experienced', 'three', 'trying', 'assimilate', 'former', 'lives', 'Homer', 'most', 'obvious', 'challenge', 'others', 'discomfort', 'handling', 'disability', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'where', 'Russell', 'artificial', 'hooks', 'window', 'sheer', 'frustration', 'young', 'sister', 'plead', 'forgiveness', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'belong', 'Andrews', 'who', 'humiliation', 'going', 'back', 'pre-war', 'soda', 'jerk', 'job', 'then', 'slowly', 'how', 'superficial', 'wife', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'build', 'life', 'again', 'perfectly', 'symbolized', 'halting', 'walk', 'massive', 'desolate', 'graveyard', 'junked', 'WWII', 'airplanes.The', 'irony', 'movie', 'title', 'refers', 'irretrievable', 'fact', 'many', 'servicemen', 'experienced', 'best', 'years', 'wartime', 'not', 'conforming', 'lives', 'peacetime', 'get', 'reacquainted', 'loved', 'ones', 'significant', 'distinction', 'treated', 'gently', 'Wyler', 'screenwriter', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Sherwood', 'almost-three-hour', 'running', 'time', 'quickly', 'one', 'true', 'sense', 'empathy', 'characters', 'even', 'Mayo', 'floozy', 'who', 'more', 'surface', 'one', 'would', 'suspect', 'Special', 'mention', 'needs', 'be', 'given', 'Cathy', ""O'Donnell"", 'touching', 'performance', 'Wilma', 'Homer', 'innocent', 'accepting', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Sterling', 'work', 'bygone', 'era']",The Best Years of Our Lives

From the returning flight to Centerville in the nose bubble of a B-29 bomber, to the interview for a promotion at the bank, to the beaded sweat generated by war memories (today's PTSD), to the pained glances of unfulfilled love shared during the wedding scene; this movie delivers handsomely.We no longer live in an era where a person's word is always their bond and I would offer that we are the worst for having lost that clarity in our lives. Viewing such a poignant story as it unfolds before us with such clarity and truthfulness as when the multiple amputee attempts to cope with sympathy from loved ones for his wounds, takes one well beyond simple feelings of empathy. When Homer's girl friend helps him off with his prosthetic arms before she tucks him in for the night, while professing her unqualified love cannot help but cause a catch in my throat when I think of my fellow returning warriors from all of the wars I have been in or witnessed.A classic, real, movie that puts-to-shame all of the mock reality venues/movies/shows of our current age.I always advise that a person should watch &#34;The Best Years&#34; with someone they love and to hold them tight if only for a brief moment.",5,This Movie Sets The Highest Bar For Drama And Human Interest Stories,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,1671,"['enjoy', 'many', 'movies', 'pride', 'having', 'discerning', 'eye', 'good', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'filmed', 'highest', 'standards', '34', 'Best', 'Years', '34', 'meets', 'values', 'highest', 'bar', 'challenge', 'other', 'movies', 'combined.The', 'human', 'condition', 'fodder', 'stories', 'people', 'make', 'screen', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'create', 'necessary', 'multi-dimensionality', 'characters/actors', 'settings', 'returning', 'flight', 'Centerville', 'nose', 'bubble', 'B-29', 'bomber', 'interview', 'promotion', 'bank', 'beaded', 'sweat', 'generated', 'war', 'memories', 'today', 'PTSD', 'pained', 'glances', 'unfulfilled', 'love', 'shared', 'wedding', 'scene', 'movie', 'handsomely.We', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'era', 'where', 'person', 'word', 'always', 'bond', 'would', 'offer', 'are', 'worst', 'having', 'lost', 'clarity', 'lives', 'Viewing', 'such', 'poignant', 'story', 'such', 'clarity', 'truthfulness', 'when', 'multiple', 'amputee', 'attempts', 'cope', 'sympathy', 'loved', 'ones', 'wounds', 'one', 'well', 'simple', 'feelings', 'empathy', 'When', 'Homer', 'girl', 'friend', 'off', 'prosthetic', 'arms', 'night', 'professing', 'unqualified', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'cause', 'catch', 'throat', 'when', 'think', 'fellow', 'returning', 'warriors', 'wars', 'have', 'been', 'witnessed.A', 'classic', 'real', 'movie', 'puts-to-shame', 'mock', 'reality', 'venues/movies/shows', 'current', 'age.I', 'always', 'advise', 'person', 'should', 'watch', '34', 'Best', 'Years', '34', 'someone', 'love', 'hold', 'tight', 'only', 'brief', 'moment']",The Best Years of Our Lives

Maybe half that! Anything longer is an epic and it better be about extraordinary men and women living extraordinary lives, preferably, against the backdrop of a particularly tumultuous historical era--or a futuristic/fantastic one. But William Wyler's 1946 classic BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES about the difficulties experienced by WWII vets upon re-enterring civilian life somehow manages to tell the tale of ordinary men and women in the years after an extraordinary historical era and to keep the viewer engrossed throughout its entire 172 minutes.  In fact, it could almost stand to be a little longer.I say that because upon watching it again recently, it occurred to me that the storyline around the returning middle-aged vet (Fredric March) seems to get dropped midway through.  His initial discomfort on rejoining his wife and reacquainting himself with his now grown children could likely have been explored in more depth.  On his first night home, he drags his wife (Myrna Loy) and daughter (Teresa Wright) out for a night on the town, a celebration that involves way too much drinking and definitely makes the women characters uncomfortable.From a 21st century perspective, the readjustment of a middle aged vet seems potentially as interesting a storyline as that of his younger comrades in arms.  But in short order, the focus shifts to the plights of those two younger vets (Dana Andrews as the bombadier reduced to resuming his job in a drug store and Harold Russell as a double amputee, struggling to adjust to life with prosthetics and recked with doubts about his suitablity for marriage to longtime sweetheart Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell), the patient and giving girl next door).  The night-on-the-town in fact, pretty much becomes a plot device to introduce Dana Andrews' character to March's daughter, which initiates another storyline involving the mutual attraction between the unhappily married Andrews and the impressionable Wright.Nowadays, with material this rich, they'd make a mini-series.  That wasn't an option back then, and thank goodness for it. BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES works best as a leisurely paced work of cinema.  Contemporary viewers may actually be surprised to see so many post-war themes developed so immediately post-war.  Frankness about matters such as divorce, disability and the psychological ramifications of war may seem a little surprising for 1946.  One might have thought that after suffering through the Depression and the Second World War, American audiences may have just wanted escapist fare.  There was plenty of that, to be sure, but the best film of 1946 (both in the opinion of many critics and of voters of Academy) was a film that bravely grappled with the issues of the day.",5,One of the Best of Any Year,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,2873,"['Nowadays', 'almost', 'unthinkable', 'movie', 'everyday', 'people', 'sort', 'everyday', 'problems', 'have', 'run', 'time', 'close', '3', 'hours', 'Maybe', 'half', 'Anything', 'longer', 'epic', 'better', 'be', 'extraordinary', 'men', 'women', 'living', 'extraordinary', 'lives', 'preferably', 'backdrop', 'particularly', 'tumultuous', 'historical', 'era', 'futuristic/fantastic', 'one', 'William', 'Wyler', '1946', 'classic', 'BEST', 'YEARS', 'OUR', 'LIVES', 'difficulties', 'experienced', 'WWII', 'vets', 're-enterring', 'civilian', 'life', 'somehow', 'tell', 'tale', 'ordinary', 'men', 'women', 'years', 'extraordinary', 'historical', 'era', 'keep', 'viewer', 'engrossed', 'entire', '172', 'minutes', 'fact', 'could', 'almost', 'stand', 'be', 'little', 'longer.I', 'say', 'watching', 'again', 'recently', 'occurred', 'storyline', 'returning', 'middle-aged', 'vet', 'Fredric', 'March', 'get', 'dropped', 'midway', 'initial', 'discomfort', 'rejoining', 'wife', 'reacquainting', 'now', 'grown', 'children', 'could', 'likely', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'more', 'depth', 'first', 'night', 'home', 'wife', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'daughter', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'out', 'night', 'town', 'celebration', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'drinking', 'definitely', 'women', 'characters', 'uncomfortable.From', '21st', 'century', 'perspective', 'readjustment', 'middle', 'aged', 'vet', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'younger', 'comrades', 'arms', 'short', 'order', 'focus', 'shifts', 'plights', 'two', 'younger', 'vets', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'bombadier', 'reduced', 'resuming', 'job', 'drug', 'store', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'double', 'amputee', 'struggling', 'adjust', 'life', 'prosthetics', 'recked', 'doubts', 'suitablity', 'marriage', 'longtime', 'sweetheart', 'Wilma', 'Cathy', ""O'Donnell"", 'patient', 'giving', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'night-on-the-town', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'plot', 'device', 'introduce', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'character', 'March', 'daughter', 'storyline', 'involving', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'unhappily', 'married', 'Andrews', 'impressionable', 'Wright.Nowadays', 'material', 'rich', ""'d"", 'make', 'mini-series', 'was', ""n't"", 'option', 'back', 'then', 'thank', 'goodness', 'BEST', 'YEARS', 'OUR', 'LIVES', 'best', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'work', 'cinema', 'Contemporary', 'viewers', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'post-war', 'themes', 'developed', 'so', 'immediately', 'post-war', 'Frankness', 'matters', 'such', 'divorce', 'disability', 'psychological', 'ramifications', 'war', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'surprising', '1946', 'One', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'suffering', 'Depression', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'American', 'audiences', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'wanted', 'escapist', 'fare', 'was', 'plenty', 'be', 'sure', 'best', 'film', '1946', 'opinion', 'many', 'critics', 'voters', 'Academy', 'was', 'film', 'bravely', 'grappled', 'issues', 'day']",The Best Years of Our Lives

It's a very honest look at the  difficulties and adjustments facing both soldiers and their loved ones when  they return home after experiencing the horrors of war and death.  The  movie looks at three soldiers dealing with different aspects of the  re-adjustment.  Fredric March must reconnect with his wife and job, and  finds comfort with the bottle.  Dana Andrews must find a job and get to  know the girl he married quickly before going off to war, a girl that was  more in love with his uniform than the man in it.  Harold Russell must  learn to adjust to civilian life and his fiancee without his arms, having  lost them during the war.  There are too many great scenes to recount.  The  performances are incredible.  Myrna Loy is at her best as March's patient  wife.

155456,A1TGXBJ96E9B8B,0792846133,James M. Stafford III,"[2, 4]","The Best Years of our Lives is a very eye-opening film concerning the difficulties of World War II veterans in returning to the States after their tour of duty.  Three returning veterans meet on a flight to their &quot;small town&quot; (which seems rather large from the air as they approach).  However, one of the men (who had seved with the Navy) has lost his hands in the war, and now has what is constantly referred to as &quot;hooks;&quot; this is by far the most touching and interesting tale of the three interwoven threads in the film, yet relatively little time is afforded to this tale.Each man returns to a family and a romantic interest.  The treatment of these issues, however, seems at odds with Hollywood fare and the Production Code system and the influence of the Legion of Decency (affiliated with the Catholic Church) of the time.  There is a very touching scene with the man with the &quot;hooks&quot; being undressed and helped into bed by his romantic interest in his bedroom (with his parents across the hallway) well before they are married.  The daughter of another returning military man falls in love with the third returning veteran even though the latter is already married; the film can be read as ambiguous at the end, but one can easily infer that they WILL get married soon (once an aforementioned divorce is finalized).Various issues facing the return of veterans are brought to the foreground in this film.  Memories (rather, nightmares) of combat and the loss of comrades, lack of interest in the medals and commendations, handling naysayers, acquired interests in smoking and drinking (heavily), apprehension at seeing family and friends once more, and - especially - the lack of job possibilities are all quite prevalent throughout the film.Except that this film is well over 2-1/2 hours in length, this is a good film overall.  The Scene Selection portion of the DVD is especially well-constructed, easily allowing users to find where to begin again if they cannot watch the entire film in just one sitting.  This is certainly not a Citizen Kane, but is still a good example of 1940s Hollywood filmmaking.",4,Good Film which is Longer than Average for 1940s Hollywood,1026000000,"07 7, 2002",2002,2144,"['Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'very', 'eye-opening', 'film', 'concerning', 'difficulties', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veterans', 'returning', 'States', 'tour', 'duty', 'Three', 'returning', 'veterans', 'meet', 'flight', 'quot', 'small', 'town', 'quot', 'rather', 'large', 'air', 'approach', 'However', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'seved', 'Navy', 'lost', 'hands', 'war', 'now', 'what', 'constantly', 'referred', 'quot', 'quot', 'far', 'most', 'touching', 'interesting', 'tale', 'three', 'interwoven', 'threads', 'film', 'yet', 'relatively', 'little', 'time', 'afforded', 'tale.Each', 'man', 'family', 'romantic', 'interest', 'treatment', 'issues', 'however', 'odds', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Production', 'Code', 'system', 'influence', 'Legion', 'Decency', 'affiliated', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'time', 'very', 'touching', 'scene', 'man', 'quot', 'quot', 'being', 'undressed', 'helped', 'bed', 'romantic', 'interest', 'bedroom', 'parents', 'hallway', 'well', 'are', 'married', 'daughter', 'returning', 'military', 'man', 'love', 'third', 'returning', 'veteran', 'even', 'latter', 'already', 'married', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'ambiguous', 'end', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'infer', 'WILL', 'get', 'married', 'soon', 'aforementioned', 'divorce', 'finalized', '.Various', 'issues', 'facing', 'return', 'veterans', 'are', 'brought', 'foreground', 'film', 'Memories', 'rather', 'nightmares', 'combat', 'loss', 'comrades', 'lack', 'interest', 'medals', 'commendations', 'handling', 'naysayers', 'acquired', 'interests', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'heavily', 'apprehension', 'seeing', 'family', 'once', 'more', 'especially', 'lack', 'job', 'possibilities', 'are', 'quite', 'prevalent', 'film.Except', 'film', 'well', '2-1/2', 'hours', 'length', 'good', 'film', 'overall', 'Scene', 'Selection', 'portion', 'DVD', 'especially', 'well-constructed', 'easily', 'allowing', 'users', 'find', 'where', 'begin', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'entire', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'sitting', 'certainly', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'still', 'good', 'example', '1940s', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking']",The Best Years of Our Lives

Wilkerson,"[3, 3]","After World War II three military men, Al Stevenson (Fredrich March) Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) and Homer Parrish (Harold Russell), return to their lives in Boone City after stints in Europe. Adjusting to life at home isn't as easy as one would think as Homer has lost his hands, Fred goes from being a Captain to being relegated to being a soda jerk in a drug store, and Al goes back to his bank job where he has to turn down loans for fellow former soldiers. As they try to adjust to their new old lives they learn things may never be the same again.William Wyler was already a famous filmmaker before going into the military for World War II, having made films such as Wuthering Heights, Jezebel, and Dodsworth. Incorporating his own experiences as a combat filmographer into the film, Wyler made what is arguable his most successful film with The Best Years of Our Lives. After it's release it went on to win 7 Academy Awards beating out It's a Wonderful Life for Best Picture, and Harold Russell won not just one but two Academy Awards (one for Best Supporting Actor, and an honorary award ""For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance""), the only actor to ever win two Academy Awards for the same performance.The Best Years of Our Lives is a film that has a lot of pertinence in today's world with so many troops overseas making their way back, and it's still the best film on the subject. Wyler's attention to detail, choosing not to make things over lavish as most films in the 1940's did, and to give it more of a documentary flair help give the film more of a real world feel. And while the subject matter might seem like the film would be a darker affair, there are moments that would still make you genuinely laugh out loud, as well as other lighter more tender moments.The acting is superb from all involved. The two actors that truly stand out in my mind watching this are Harold Russell and Al Stevenson. Harold Russell, an actual physically disabled military man, shows great depth in his performance as Homer Parrish dealing with love and the notion that he needs to drive his girl away because she deserves better. Al Stevenson, also does a superb job as a former sergeant who feels guilty for having come home to find himself a good job while also dealing with family issues and his feelings toward having to away loans for former GI's who feel they deserve better.I highly recommend this movie, this is one of those rare perfect movies and to be honest, it deserved it's best picture nod over It's A Wonderful Life. Even with it's ranking on AFI's top 100 films at #37, these days this film is still criminally overlooked and underrated. If you like films dealing with WWII, great dramas, and superb acting, you should definitely give this film a shot.5/5",5,The Best Years of Our Lives,1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,2805,"['World', 'War', 'II', 'three', 'military', 'men', 'Al', 'Stevenson', 'Fredrich', 'March', 'Fred', 'Derry', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Homer', 'Parrish', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'return', 'lives', 'Boone', 'City', 'stints', 'Europe', 'Adjusting', 'life', 'home', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Homer', 'lost', 'hands', 'Fred', 'being', 'Captain', 'being', 'relegated', 'being', 'soda', 'jerk', 'drug', 'store', 'Al', 'back', 'bank', 'job', 'where', 'turn', 'down', 'loans', 'fellow', 'former', 'soldiers', 'try', 'adjust', 'new', 'old', 'learn', 'things', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again.William', 'Wyler', 'was', 'already', 'famous', 'filmmaker', 'going', 'military', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'having', 'made', 'films', 'such', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'Jezebel', 'Dodsworth', 'Incorporating', 'own', 'experiences', 'combat', 'filmographer', 'film', 'Wyler', 'made', 'what', 'arguable', 'most', 'successful', 'film', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'release', 'went', 'win', '7', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'beating', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'won', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'one', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'honorary', 'award', 'bringing', 'hope', 'courage', 'fellow', 'veterans', 'appearance', 'only', 'actor', 'ever', 'win', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'same', 'performance.The', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'film', 'lot', 'pertinence', 'today', 'world', 'so', 'many', 'troops', 'overseas', 'making', 'way', 'back', 'still', 'best', 'film', 'subject', 'Wyler', 'attention', 'detail', 'choosing', 'not', 'make', 'things', 'over', 'lavish', 'most', 'films', '1940', 'did', 'give', 'more', 'documentary', 'flair', 'help', 'give', 'film', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'feel', 'subject', 'matter', 'might', 'seem', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'darker', 'affair', 'are', 'moments', 'would', 'still', 'make', 'genuinely', 'out', 'loud', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'lighter', 'more', 'tender', 'moments.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'involved', 'two', 'actors', 'truly', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'watching', 'are', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'Al', 'Stevenson', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'actual', 'physically', 'disabled', 'military', 'man', 'great', 'depth', 'performance', 'Homer', 'Parrish', 'dealing', 'love', 'notion', 'drive', 'girl', 'away', 'better', 'Al', 'Stevenson', 'also', 'superb', 'job', 'former', 'sergeant', 'who', 'guilty', 'having', 'come', 'home', 'find', 'good', 'job', 'also', 'dealing', 'family', 'issues', 'feelings', 'having', 'away', 'loans', 'former', 'GI', 'who', 'feel', 'deserve', 'better.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'one', 'rare', 'perfect', 'movies', 'be', 'honest', 'deserved', 'best', 'picture', 'nod', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Even', 'ranking', 'AFI', 'top', '100', 'films', '37', 'days', 'film', 'still', 'criminally', 'overlooked', 'underrated', 'like', 'films', 'dealing', 'WWII', 'great', 'dramas', 'superb', 'acting', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'film', 'shot.5/5']",The Best Years of Our Lives

I realize the junk and filthy sewage coming out of Hollywood today from incompetent filmmakers is on a totally different plane as this film. So, I wish to ask two simple questions. I have not seen one review mentioning this slight 'flaw' in the film. Here goes: Where is Al's son after the first 20 minutes of the film? Why was he even cast in the first place? The character adds absolutely nothing to the film. He is on screen, then....gone. If I could have a meeting with Wyler, I would ask him these two questions.Now, an open challenge. I have been wanting to do this. I shall the next time I view the film. Perhaps you would like to try it. I don't recommend anyone who has not seen the film do this. But, if you have seen it, preferably many times, try this: watch all 3 hours of this brilliant film with the volume turned DOWN! That will be a true testament to how good this film is. Watch for facial expressions and body language. Watch Myrna Loy's fidgeting body language  when first reintroduced to her husband. Both of them, married for decades, don't even know each other. Watch how the great Hoagy Carmichael interacts with Harold Russell. Observe how Roman Bohnen reads the citation concerning his son (Bohnen was actually only seven years older than Dana Andrews). Notice how Walter Baldwin deals with his handicapped son while helping him get ready for bed. See how he is no longer feeling pity for Homer. He is getting used to the fact that Homer is still his son and with hands or no hands, Homer is still his son. All this can be seen, and felt, just by body language and facial expressions.While not wanting to place this ""human"" story (and that's exactly what it is) into a category of 'war film', it wouldn't hurt to watch this film immediately following a screening of the greatest war film ever made and war's  effect on the human condition, 'All Quiet On the Western Front' (1930). Upon the release of 'All Quiet On the Western Front', Variety wrote a review of which could easily apply to 'The Best Years of Our Lives' (substituting with The United Nations, of course): ""The League of Nations could make no better investment than to buy up the master-print, reproduce it in every language, to be shown in all the nations until the word ""war"" is taken out of the dictionaries"".I really don't need anyone to tell me that this film is probably the greatest film ever made....I already know it.",5,Only One Flaw in This Masterpiece of Cinema / A Challenge to Cinema Lovers Everywhere,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,2502,"['reading', 'hundred', 'so', 'reviews', 'film', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'more', 'realize', 'junk', 'filthy', 'sewage', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'incompetent', 'filmmakers', 'totally', 'different', 'plane', 'film', 'So', 'wish', 'ask', 'two', 'simple', 'questions', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'one', 'review', 'mentioning', 'slight', ""'flaw"", 'film', 'Here', 'Where', 'Al', 'son', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'Why', 'was', 'even', 'cast', 'first', 'place', 'character', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'screen', 'then', '.gone', 'could', 'have', 'meeting', 'Wyler', 'would', 'ask', 'two', 'questions.Now', 'open', 'challenge', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'do', 'shall', 'next', 'time', 'view', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'like', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'seen', 'preferably', 'many', 'times', 'try', 'watch', '3', 'hours', 'brilliant', 'film', 'volume', 'turned', 'DOWN', 'will', 'be', 'true', 'testament', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'Watch', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'Watch', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'fidgeting', 'body', 'language', 'when', 'first', 'reintroduced', 'husband', 'married', 'decades', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'other', 'Watch', 'how', 'great', 'Hoagy', 'Carmichael', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'Observe', 'how', 'Roman', 'Bohnen', 'citation', 'concerning', 'son', 'Bohnen', 'was', 'actually', 'only', 'seven', 'years', 'older', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Notice', 'how', 'Walter', 'Baldwin', 'deals', 'handicapped', 'son', 'helping', 'get', 'ready', 'bed', 'See', 'how', 'no', 'longer', 'feeling', 'pity', 'Homer', 'getting', 'used', 'fact', 'Homer', 'still', 'son', 'hands', 'hands', 'Homer', 'still', 'son', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'felt', 'just', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions.While', 'not', 'wanting', 'place', 'human', 'story', 'exactly', 'what', 'category', ""'war"", 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'watch', 'film', 'immediately', 'following', 'screening', 'greatest', 'war', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'war', 'effect', 'human', 'condition', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', '1930', 'release', ""'All"", 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'Variety', 'wrote', 'review', 'could', 'easily', 'apply', ""'The"", 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'substituting', 'United', 'Nations', 'course', 'League', 'Nations', 'could', 'make', 'better', 'investment', 'buy', 'up', 'master-print', 'reproduce', 'language', 'be', 'shown', 'nations', 'word', 'war', 'taken', 'dictionaries', '.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'anyone', 'tell', 'film', 'probably', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', '.I', 'already', 'know']",The Best Years of Our Lives

155471,A2Y4AHQ69FW6SC,0792846133,"Joseph Deprospero ""Joedb3""","[1, 1]","This film is one of my all time favorites - one memorable scene after another. The stories of the three returning veterans are seamlessly integrated into the film and the performances of the leads - Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell are top notch, as well as the stellar supporting cast led by Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and Virginia Mayo. Even the minor characters - Ray Collins and a pre-Bonanza Ray Teal give effective, albeit brief performances. And the casting of the great songwriter Hoagy Carmichael as the disabled vet Homer Parrish's uncle created an additional dimension to the film as well. The scene in which he plays his tune Up A Lazy River while giving Homer a fatherly but kind lecture on how to deal with the difficulties Homer is having with family relationships is magnificently understated.One gets a true sense of what it must have been like in America immediately after the war, in this case a fictional Midwestern city I would guess to be the size of Omaha. The scenes in which the Frederic March and Harold Russell characters return home are among the best I have ever seen - unbridled happiness tempered with, in the case of Russell's return, sorrow at the loss of a loved one's hands. The return of the Dana Andrews character tees up his already unraveling marital relationship.Additionally the anticipation and reality of finally coming home (the airplane and taxi rides) are effectively communicated to the viewer. The brief shots of people and things in the city itself from the cab give the viewer an excellent sense of what it must have looked like in America right after the war.The film's climax, the marriage of the Harold Russell character, ties things up nicely.This film has been praised for its treatment of alcoholism, divorce, and physical disabilities. Nearly 70 years later these topics are still relevant and, although handled effectively in other films, the treatment here remains credible.Even in the best of films there is almost always room for some criticism, however mild. While not detracting from the film's greatness The Best Years of Our Lives is no exception:- Frederic March seems too old for the character he is playing. March, I believe was in his forties when the film was made and looks ten years older. To think that his character was an active combat participant in the war, as is implied several times, is a bit of a stretch. To a lesser degree, Dana Andrews also seems a bit too old for a young and lovely Teresa Wright. However, I do understand why it was cast this way - the box office draw of March and Andrews was key to the financial success of this picture. Too, actors in film roles more appropriate for younger men has been repeated countless times.- To my consternation even this great film has a continuity error. This is one of my pet peeves as I know there were and are production personnel specifically charged with ensuring that the dialog, costumes, scenery, etc., remain consistent. In this case the Virginia Mayo character expresses shock at seeing her husband (Dana Andrews) for the first time out of his Air Force uniform, however, later in the film Andrews alludes to the times before the war when he would prepare a meal for Mayo behind the counter at the local drug store where he was employed as a soda jerk. One would assume he was not in his military uniform in that capacity.Ok, enough criticism - this film is a masterpiece - one that I highly recommend.",5,Moving Look at Post WWII America - Great Performances,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,3458,"['film', 'one', 'time', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'stories', 'three', 'returning', 'veterans', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'film', 'performances', 'leads', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'as', 'well', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'led', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'pre-Bonanza', 'Ray', 'Teal', 'give', 'effective', 'albeit', 'brief', 'performances', 'casting', 'great', 'songwriter', 'Hoagy', 'Carmichael', 'disabled', 'vet', 'Homer', 'Parrish', 'uncle', 'created', 'additional', 'dimension', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'tune', 'Up', 'Lazy', 'River', 'giving', 'Homer', 'fatherly', 'kind', 'lecture', 'how', 'deal', 'difficulties', 'Homer', 'having', 'family', 'relationships', 'magnificently', 'understated.One', 'true', 'sense', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'America', 'immediately', 'war', 'case', 'fictional', 'Midwestern', 'city', 'would', 'guess', 'be', 'size', 'Omaha', 'scenes', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'characters', 'return', 'home', 'are', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'unbridled', 'happiness', 'tempered', 'case', 'Russell', 'return', 'sorrow', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'hands', 'return', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'character', 'up', 'already', 'unraveling', 'marital', 'relationship.Additionally', 'anticipation', 'reality', 'finally', 'coming', 'home', 'airplane', 'taxi', 'rides', 'are', 'effectively', 'communicated', 'viewer', 'brief', 'shots', 'people', 'things', 'city', 'cab', 'give', 'viewer', 'excellent', 'sense', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'America', 'right', 'war.The', 'film', 'climax', 'marriage', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'character', 'ties', 'things', 'up', 'nicely.This', 'film', 'been', 'praised', 'treatment', 'alcoholism', 'divorce', 'physical', 'disabilities', 'Nearly', '70', 'years', 'later', 'topics', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'handled', 'effectively', 'other', 'films', 'treatment', 'here', 'credible.Even', 'best', 'films', 'almost', 'always', 'room', 'criticism', 'however', 'mild', 'not', 'detracting', 'film', 'greatness', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'exception', 'March', 'too', 'old', 'character', 'playing', 'March', 'believe', 'was', 'forties', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'ten', 'years', 'older', 'think', 'character', 'was', 'active', 'combat', 'participant', 'war', 'implied', 'several', 'times', 'bit', 'stretch', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'young', 'lovely', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'However', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'cast', 'way', 'box', 'office', 'draw', 'March', 'Andrews', 'was', 'key', 'financial', 'success', 'picture', 'Too', 'actors', 'film', 'roles', 'more', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'men', 'been', 'repeated', 'countless', 'times.-', 'consternation', 'even', 'great', 'film', 'continuity', 'error', 'one', 'pet', 'peeves', 'know', 'were', 'are', 'production', 'personnel', 'specifically', 'charged', 'ensuring', 'dialog', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'etc.', 'remain', 'consistent', 'case', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'character', 'shock', 'seeing', 'husband', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'first', 'time', 'Air', 'Force', 'uniform', 'however', 'later', 'film', 'Andrews', 'times', 'war', 'when', 'would', 'prepare', 'meal', 'Mayo', 'counter', 'local', 'drug', 'store', 'where', 'was', 'employed', 'soda', 'jerk', 'One', 'would', 'assume', 'was', 'not', 'military', 'uniform', 'capacity.Ok', 'enough', 'criticism', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Best Years of Our Lives

155479,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,0792846133,K. Boullosa,"[5, 7]","This deeply moving, beautifully written and performed film, was a long-planned tribute by director William Wyler to veterans of World War II, whose heroic service Wyler witnessed first-hand.  Posted overseas himself during the war, Wyler vowed that when he returned to Hollywood, he would make a film that paid some sort of tribute to the men he worked with.  ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is the fulfillment of Wyler's promise.  Released in 1947, the film won seven Oscars (it was nominated for eight) including Best Picture and Best Director.""The Best Years of Our Lives"" tells the stories of three veterans returning home to their small midwestern city from active service in WWII: Fred, a much-decorated Air Force pilot (Dana Andrews) from a poor background who, before the war, worked as a soda jerk at a drugstore lunch counter; Homer, a Navy sailor (Harold Russell) and former high school football star who has lost both arms; and Al, an army sergeant who, in civilian life, is a successful banker with two teenaged children.As the veterans return to homes and wives and/or family (only Homer is not married, although waiting anxiously for him is his high school sweetheart, Wilma, played by Cathy O'Donnell), they confront difficulties reintegrating themselves into ordinary life, and re-establishing emotional contact with those who have been waiting at home.  The men carry horrifying war memories that have changed their values and outlook on life, yet also experience disorientation going back to an existence that lacks the immediacy of life lived at the edge of survival.Al Stevenson finds himself initially shy and reluctant to resume intimate relations with his strong-willed wife (Myrna Loy) - he has to realign the parameters of their relationship with her and their two children who in his absence have blossomed into adulthood.  Fred Derry, the Purple Heart pilot, finds that Marie, his lively blonde bombshell of a wife (Virginia Mayo), whom he married without knowing her well just before being sent overseas, has left his parents' home and gotten an apartment and a job of her own; Homer, the disabled sailor, cannot cope with his family's well-meaning but pitying response to his disfigurement, nor can he believe or trust that Wilma still loves him.The film traces each man's response to the placid pace of civilian life, and to the readjustment he must make to the societal and economic changes of the post-War era that are already spreading across the country.  As a disabled veteran, Homer does not have to worry about re-entering the work force, but he feels like a freak and resists Wilma's attempts to reassure him that the loss of his arms has not changed her feelings toward him - he withdraws from his family into a painful depression.  Fred is plagued by nightmares about being shot down in his plane, and finds that while his old job behind a five-and-dime lunch counter is now inadequate for a man with his experience, his lack of higher education or other training leaves him few options. Moreover, Fred finds that his pretty wife is unsympathetic to his issues and self-involved, interested only in having a good time. Al finds that although he is welcomed back into his fine job at the bank, his desire to approve loans to returning veterans who haven't much collateral to back them up are challenged by his higher-ups, to whom he must explain why he trusts these men to honor their debt, and to whom the country owes a debt.As Homer tries to drive Wilma away, because he does not want her to marry him out of pity, Fred's and Al's lives overlap.  Fred finds himself unable to function at his old job or take orders from a fresh-faced college grad who did not serve in the war, and loses the job when he slugs a man at the lunch counter who insinuates that the war was an unnecessary one foisted on America by Roosevelt.  Marie is unwilling to adjust her lifestyle downward to accommodate only his service benefits and resents not being able to go out and enjoy life, and eventually she leaves him for another ex-serviceman who is doing better.  At the same time, through his friendship with Al, Fred has met Peggy, Al's daughter (Teresa Wright), who is charming, intelligent, and virtuous, and falls in love with her.  Touched by Fred's struggles, and by the innate qualities that she discerns in him, Peggy is equally attracted to this diamond in the rough.  But Al, much as he admires and likes Fred, cannot approve of his cherished daughter's relationship with the drifting, still-married Fred, and tells Fred to stay away from Peggy.Finally, in one of the most tender scenes ever filmed, Wilma one evening helps Homer remove his prosthetic arms and get ready for bed in his parent's home. Homer realizes that Wilma truly loves him and tells her that he has always loved her and will never love anyone else.  In another wonderful scene, the disrupted relationship between Al and his wife moves into calmer waters as they relate to the confused Peggy the emotional hardhips of the early years of their marriage, and how they moved forward, anyway, committed to their lives together as a family.  And, in what is perhaps the film's most famous scene, Fred exorcises some of his wartime demons in the cockpit of a B-52 that is about to be dismantled, needed for materials to fulfill the demand for inexpensive housing in post-War America.  Fred persuades the boss of the outfit performing the work to give him a job.At the end of the film, the three veterans gather for Homer's wedding in Wilma's parent's house.  Marie is divorcing Fred, who is living with his father and stepmother.  During the touchingly home-made parlor wedding  (compare it to the luxurious church wedding of the spoilt Kay Banks in ""Father of the Bride"" just three years later), Fred and Peggy, at opposite ends of the parlor, gaze at each other during the simple service and silently commit themselves to each other.  While the other guests are congratulating the newly married Homer and Wilma, Fred takes Peggy in his arms and as he does so, her hat falls off as she embraces him, a charming symbolic reference to surrender and the move from girlhood to womanhood.""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is a long film, nearly three hours, but is worth every moment of your time as Wyler, whose love for his protagonists shows in every frame, portrays their shifting relationships and the adjustment both they and America make as they move into the new environment of post-World War II America.The performances are sensitive and heart-felt, with special mention going to Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, the tormented air force hero from the wrong side of the tracks who finds himself adrift in a new world.  Harold Russell, who plays Homer, was, in fact, a disabled veteran who had never acted when he was selected for this role.  While clearly the work of an amateur, his (wisely) unadorned performance works well and garnered a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  Frederic March has never been one of my favorite actors, but his undeniable gifts bring Al Stevenson to life, and won for March the Best Actor Oscar.  Cathy O'Donnell (who would later appear as Charlton Heston's young sister in ""Ben-Hur"") gives an affecting, low-key performance as the patient, loving Wilma. Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright are perfect as, respectively, the classy, forthright Mrs. Stevenson, and as Peggy Stevenson, who shows her mother's backbone in her determination to stand by and help the man she has chosen.Virginia Mayo, a highly under-rated actress, is marvellous as the high-spirited, ""selfish"" Marie.  Mayo has a thankless role here as the one woman in the film who is unwilling to sacrifice her own interests to support her man, but she makes the most of it and gives the role bite and life.  The role of Marie brings me to the one quibble I have with this otherwise flawlessly conceived and delivered film, of which I am deeply fond, and which never fails to reduce me to tears.Wyler draws what is, in my opinion, far too sharp a distinction between the ""good"" and ""bad"" women in this film.  It is notable that Marie, the one woman in the film who is overtly uninterested in making sacrifices for the returning soldier, is also the only woman in the film who is overtly sexual. Marie's curvaceous figure, blondeness, provocative clothes, and love of a good time stand in contrast to the rather extreme asexuality of Peggy and Wilma, the two young virgins, who are both very thin, dress plainly, and are constantly seen happily performing routine household tasks such as cooking breakfast and washing dishes.  They appear to have no individual cores whatsoever that do not revolve around Homer and Fred.  The climate of the post-War era must be taken into account here, as a time when women were being heavily pressured to give up the jobs they had held during the war in the men's absence (and consequently, give up their taste of economic independence) so that returning veterans could have the jobs; women were also being heavily pressured to take up lives centered wholly on homemaking - the result, of course, was the post-War ""baby boom"".Fred Derry is a sympathetic character with legitimate issues, but it is not as if Marie is entirely wrong to be disappointed at how things seem to be turning out when he returns. Fred IS a difficult package, and he and Marie married without knowing each other at all.  Marie loves her independent life and that she should be demonized (that is the only word for it) for preferring to move on and enjoy life, rather than staying home with a brooding, troubled husband who refuses to let her augment their slender income with a job, begs some questions of the ideals women were expected to fulfill in the post-War era - ideals which led to the first wave of feminism as the 1950s closed and the 1960s opened. As Marie storms out of their small apartment, she shouts, ""I'm going to live for myself!"".  No sentiment could have been less appreciated in American women after the war, and Marie's declaration is meant to demonstrate the height of unwomanly behavior, particularly compared to the purity, selflessness, and curious asexuality of Peggy and Wilma, as they commit themselves to men with notable problems.  Only Myrna Loy, among the ""good"" women, is allowed to show a bit of pepper and curve, but then, she has been proven as the faithful matron and mother.  In this reviewer's opinion, the contrast Wyler draws between the openly sexual and independent Marie and the two selfless, asexual younger girls, is unfair and, as history proved over subsequent decades of social upheaval, unrealistic.That issue aside, my respect and affection for this exceptional film has remained undimmed over the years.",4,Gem of American Film,1208304000,"04 16,

Too often the WW II pictures that were made in the Post War years of the 1950's whitewashed the many issues that returning veterans, their famalies, and for that matter the entire nation faced as the war ended.This movie was made just after the war ended, and it was probally made just in time to have kept it so real.A trio of returning Vets comes back to their mid-western ""any town USA"" to start their lives anew. Fredrich March as the returning banker questions where his priorities should be almost from the day that he lands back at work.  Dana Andrews, the highest ranking amoung them made a name for himself in the military, but is faced with a less than ideal work situation back home, and has a very indifferent wife played by Virginia Mayo.  Harold Russell plays the amputee of the trio (he lost his hands in the war), and faces life in a nation without any of the protections that the disabled now have.Meanwhile the tale is woven with everthing from jealousy expressed about the Vets from those who remained at home and now fear loosing their jobs to them, to the anxiety that a new war could break out any day. This era in US history was hardly ideal and this movie is brutally honest as few Hollywood epics are.Myrna (Thin Man) Loy and Teresa Wright round out the oustanding cast.True this movie does have the Holloywood Happy Ending, but it still left enough unanswered questions to keep people thinking.A truly worthy Oscar Winner!",5,Truly In A League of It's Own,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,1596,"['epic', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'US', 'Citizens', 'one', 'truest', 'portraits', 'ever', 'made', 'immediate', 'Post', 'World', 'War', '2', 'America', 'Too', 'often', 'WW', 'II', 'were', 'made', 'Post', 'War', 'years', '1950', 'whitewashed', 'many', 'issues', 'returning', 'veterans', 'famalies', 'matter', 'entire', 'nation', 'faced', 'war', 'ended.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'war', 'ended', 'was', 'probally', 'made', 'just', 'time', 'have', 'kept', 'so', 'real.A', 'trio', 'returning', 'Vets', 'back', 'mid-western', 'town', 'USA', 'start', 'lives', 'anew', 'Fredrich', 'March', 'returning', 'banker', 'questions', 'where', 'priorities', 'should', 'be', 'almost', 'day', 'back', 'work', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'highest', 'ranking', 'amoung', 'made', 'name', 'military', 'faced', 'less', 'ideal', 'work', 'situation', 'back', 'home', 'very', 'indifferent', 'wife', 'played', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'amputee', 'trio', 'lost', 'hands', 'war', 'life', 'nation', 'protections', 'disabled', 'now', 'have.Meanwhile', 'tale', 'woven', 'everthing', 'jealousy', 'expressed', 'Vets', 'who', 'remained', 'home', 'now', 'fear', 'loosing', 'jobs', 'anxiety', 'new', 'war', 'could', 'break', 'out', 'day', 'era', 'US', 'history', 'was', 'hardly', 'ideal', 'movie', 'brutally', 'honest', 'few', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'are.Myrna', 'Thin', 'Man', 'Loy', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'round', 'oustanding', 'cast.True', 'movie', 'have', 'Holloywood', 'Happy', 'Ending', 'still', 'left', 'enough', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'keep', 'people', 'thinking.A', 'truly', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'Winner']",The Best Years of Our Lives

Loy and March have had a lot of adjusting to do just recently, with his having returned home from the war in the Pacific, and they're not the only ones facing that challenge. &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; concerns three servicemen, each from a different branch of service, each from a different socioeconomic level, each at a different time of life, who must make the difficult adjustment from wartime to peacetime. Frederic March was in the army. He's been married twenty years to his wife and is a well-to-do banker living in a luxury apartment building. His challenge is to re-enter his marriage and try to balance the needs of the bank with the needs of returning loan-seeking veterans. Dana Andrews was a star pilot in the airforce. He's from a shanty on the wrong side of the tracks,  and he got married after a whirlwind romance while on furlough. He's got to find a job outside the airforcce now, and deal with some bad combat memories while coping with his good-time girl of a wife, Virginia Mayo. The actor playing Homer was not a professional, but was chosen because, like the character he portrayed, he too had lost both his hands in an accident during the war. Like Andrews, he has to find a job, but he has the extra burden of being disabled complicating his long-standing engagement to the girl next door.  March and &quot;Homer&quot; have the best scenes in the movie, but for different reasons. March is a veteran actor playing a veteran of combat. He brings great depth to his role, beautifully giving us awkwardness and passion mixed together in his early scenes with Loy as they spend their first day morning together post war.  Homer has the scenes with emotional wallop: his homecoming, when his mother's hand flies to her mouth as she first sees his hooks as he waves goodbye to the other men in the cab; the solitude of his nights, when his father has to prepare him for bed; his vulnerability as he demonstrates to his fiancee what it would mean to marry a person with such disabilites. This is the price of war, even with victory. A fundamentally honest work, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; details the anxiety of veterans at drift back on the homefront.

He deserved every ounce of his two - yes two - Oscars that he received for this role.  He is amazing to watch.  Though disabled, it was hard to consider him handicapped.  I once used this film in my sunday school class.  The lesson was on overcoming adversity and I showed the scene where Russell plays a piano duet with Hoagy Carmichael.  The girls in my class were amazed.  Then I shared with them some of the other things Russell had accomplished in his life - like being a founder of AMVETS.  Russell's off screen story is a story in itself and should be made into a movie.  Unfortunately, no actor could convincingly play him.

155487,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,0792846133,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[4, 4]","In modern times we are very familiar with how hard it is for veterans to return from war. We understand about the post traumatic stress, the challenges they can have adjusting to civilian life, and so on. But in 1946, this sort of knowledge was far less well known. Returning vets were often told to ""get over it"" and just forget about what they'd seen. The Best Years of Our Lives is a powerful look into how three soldiers returning from WWII deal with their new lives. As it came out in 1946, right when this was happening, it was quite timely, and helped audiences realize just what was going on around them.First we have the air force captain who is used to the high life. He had been elevated from soda jerk to idolized man and won awards along the way. He expects to come home to his brand-new beautiful wife and continue his upward progress. But instead he's back to being a soda jerk and his wife loses interest in his non-uniformed look.Next is the solid, older family man with a wife and two kids. He finds it hard to cope with his banking job, potentially turning down loans for GIs who want to restart their lives.And finally there's the navy man who lost both hands in a tragic accident. The actor who plays him was in fact a vet who lost both hands, which makes the scenes with him quite powerful and compelling. This isn't CGI at work. He really has dealt with what is being described.What makes this movie even more involving for me is that they tell not just these men's stories but also the stories of those who love them. The girlfriend of the navy man adores him with all her heart. She doesn't mind the loss of his hands. She wants to be by his side. She feels frustrated and shut out when he repeatedly turns away from her.So many classic movies have a nearly all male cast, and it might have been accepted here since the movie is about war's aftermaths. But the writers created a fantastic screenplay which won an Oscar; one which showed how so many others - mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters - were intricately affected as well.It's a shame that, while most people have seen Casablanca, Citizen Kane, and other classics, few have seen this one. Maybe it's the 3 hour running time. Maybe for some reason it doesn't seem as ""exciting"" as a movie about war times.

It tells the story of 3 servicemen coming home after the war and the adjustments they faced as they tried to resume life with their family, friends and employment. The pacing of the film is relaxing, allowing for ample character development.  The viewer is willingly drawn into the film by such methods as real town street scenes taken from the taxi window as the men share their first ride home after years of being away and also by the use of a non-professional actor as one of the main characters.

155490,A1D90MKRWB0ZKP,0792846133,March boy,"[0, 0]","Academy award nominations: Sound Mixing.Wins: Picture, Director-William Wyler, Leading Actor-Fredric March, Supporting Actor-Harold Russell, Screenplay, Film Editing and Original Score-Hugo Friedhofer.March Boy awards nominations: Original Score-Hugo Friedhofer.Wins: Black and White Cinematography and Black and White Set Design.Everyone talks about How Green Was My Valley being the movie that beat out Citizen Kane for Best Picture and Director so I thought I'd write a similar about a similar topic. I bought The Best Years of Our Lives mainly because I was curious about what on earth could possibly have beaten out It's a Wonderful Life for Best Picture, Director (William Wyler) and especially Leading Actor. (James Stewart) That being said I was pleasantly surprised to see a good, solidly acted, fairly well-written and extremely well photographed (same photographer as Citizen Kane so that should tell you something) film. The subject matter of three veterans struggling to readjust themselves to everyday life at home may seem dull and tepid to a modern audience accustomed to bombs, explosions and CGI monsters every twenty minutes and I respect that opinion because everyone is different but I largely enjoyed just watching these characters do their thing for two and a half hours.However there are a couple things that detracted me from giving it five stars.1. Frederic March is okay as the middle aged soldier Al Stephenson but what annoys me is that he often goes into these permanent self-conscious frowns and stony stares. It works well in the serious scenes like when he's confronting Fred in the caf&eacute; for flirting with his daughter Peggy but in other scenes like when he's celebrating his return or making a speech at a dinner party it looks a little strange. He isn't exactly bad but I'm pretty sure the touchy, subject matter of veterans coming home that almost everyone in 1946 America could relate to had more to do with his win than the quality of his acting. When I think about James Stewart's ""I know what I'm going to do tomorrow, the next day and the one after that."" and ""Please God let me live again."" speeches, March comes across as a little flat.2. The way Al and Milly's son Rob just fades out of the movie. We only see him in two scenes and then he just sort of disappears. Why didn't they invite him to go partying it up from nightclub to caf&eacute; to resturaunt when they were celebrating Al's return? They invited the daughter so why not the son? Was it due to some sort of favoritism or was he underage for alchohol consumption--the second is hardly probable considering he looks about eighteen to twenty. He doesn't really make much of an impression on the screen and we never even see him turn up for the wedding at the end. So why did the screenwriters even bother to put him in the script? You got me. I found this a problem of sloppy screenwriting but William Wyler has to shoulder on some of the blame for that.But back to the pros. The cast (with the possible exception of Fredric March) is just flawless from top to bottom. Personally I wouldn't have nominated or awarded any of them but they all completely melt into their characters like putting on gloves. Harold Russell gives a very vivid, moving performance as Homer Parrish and never hits a false note which totally baffles me since he was a non-professional but acts like he's been acting all his life. His subtle facial expressions (when he smiles and frowns and cries) look very real. Probably the biggest emotional punch is where he takes his girlfriend Wilma upstairs and shows her his harness and hooks for hands and you suddenly realize that this isn't an actor who just covered his hands up for the film--William Wyler hired a real disabled soldier. Personally I would have given the Best Supporting Actor award to the non-nominated Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter in It's a Wonderful Life but I can understand the sympathy behind the judges awarding Harold Russell for playing himself. Cathy O'Donnell is okay as his girlfriend-next-door Tiszah Ben-Hur sorry I mean Wilma. ;)Dana Andrews (Fred) has some great moments like the dream sequence, punching out the customer that tries to antagonize Homer and sitting in the broken airplane reminiscing on the past. Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright give lovely, restrained turns as Milly and Peggy and Virginia Mayo is particularly good as the annoying, grating, superficial blond bimbo Marie.Plus the movie does a very good job teaching a lesson that marriage isn't just about the mushy-mushy feelings--it's about for better or for worse, for rich or for poor and walking the line even when you're tempted. Fred realizes he was a bad husband and begged Peggy's forgiveness but unfortunately his wife Marie was too shallow and self-absorbed to realize her faults.Probably the best parts were:1. The scenes with Homer and Wilma. Their romance was so sweet and beautifully handled and the wedding scene was terrific.2. Peggy telling her parents they don't know what it's like to have a marriage on the rocks because they always get along. Milly looks up at Al with a grin and says ""Oh yeah. In all the thirty years we've been married we NEVER quarreled or fought or yelled at each other. Right? How many times have I said I hated you and how many times did you call me an ungrateful woman and said we we're both useless and washed up? And we had to kiss and make up over and over again.""Gregg Toland's cinematography is REALLY good. The best parts are the spacious shots of the town and city and the beginning where the three soldiers are looking out of the round windows in the airplane. Hugo Friedhofer's music is rich, lush and dramatic especially the scene where Fred goes to the broken airplane junkyard and Homer and Wilma's second scene in his bedroom.I still think It's a Wonderful Life should have won the major Oscars that year (Picture, Director and Leading Actor) but The Best Years of Our Lives is still good in its own way.Four stars.",4,The movie that beat out It's a

Firmly directed by William Wyler, it concerns the struggles of 3 returning veterans to readjust to civilian life - and to their families. The leads are Fredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell.  Mr. Russell plays a disabled vet who in real life was a disabled Navy seaman. The pace of BY is leisurely, giving the cast time to ""adjust"" to their surroundings. Viewers should not notice the nearly 3 hour run time.  Andrews has the most difficult adjustment, coming home to a wife he doesn't know and who had plainly been unfaithful during his absence. Vietnam era vets will quickly surmise that ""Jody"" had been around! One aches for Andrews as he returns to work at that cloying drug store, unable to find a better spot. There are few jobs for ex fighter pilots! March has the most nuanced role, since he is an ""old married man"" with a wife and kids. His wife, Myrna Loy, is strong and faithful. She will have to be! March too, is less than enthusiastic about returning to his bank job. Credit his grandfatherly boss, Ray Collins, for not only holding a job for him but also handing him a promotion! March has a painfully obvious struggle with the bottle and is a lucky man to have such a great boss and patient wife! March needs all the support he can get when the unhappily married Andrews gets involved with his daughter! She is ""good girl"" Teresa Wright. The most interesting role is Russell's. Wounded in real life when his aircraft carrier was attacked, he was discovered by Director William Wyler at a War Bond rally. The most touching moment in BY is when Russell shows fianc&eacute;e Cathy O' Donnell how is hand hooks work. BY swept the 1946 Academy Awards winning Best Picture, Director (Wyler), Best Actor (March), Best Supporting Actor (Russell), Best Screenplay, and Best Dramatic Score. Russell was also given a Special Award for ""bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans"". He remains the only actor to receive 2 awards for the same role. It's too bad that Andrews and Loy went empty handed.  Both quietly played their roles to perfection, especially Loy in dealing with a hard husband struggling to settle down. A final compliment should be given to Virginia Mayo, Andrew's bad girl wife. It's hard playing such a witchy woman but she does to virtual perfection. Viewers should observe Wyler's camera work. BY is shot in deep focus: there is almost always action in the rear of a scene, especially in that awful drugstore! Credit goes to Mike Mayo's ""War Movies"" for that observation and the background on Mr. Russell. BY is highly recommended. It captures the way we were in a very special time in this country's history. Amazoners are encouraged to devote 165 minutes to watching it. The beauty of video is that one can watch over 2 or 3 sittings. This reviewer was tempted to deduct a star for that absolutely hokey fadeout, which is not divulged here. We all like ""happy endings"" but please! Still, viewers must not let those silly 30 seconds detract from 164.5 minutes of Hollywood gold.",5,You CAN Go Home Again,1099180800,"10 31, 2004",2004,3131,"['Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'Wartme', 'classic', 'set', 'eponymous', 'Midwestern', 'town', 'immediately', 'WW2', 'Firmly', 'directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'struggles', '3', 'returning', 'veterans', 'readjust', 'civilian', 'life', 'families', 'leads', 'are', 'Fredric', 'March', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'Mr.', 'Russell', 'disabled', 'vet', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'disabled', 'Navy', 'seaman', 'pace', 'BY', 'leisurely', 'giving', 'cast', 'time', 'adjust', 'surroundings', 'Viewers', 'should', 'not', 'notice', 'nearly', '3', 'hour', 'run', 'time', 'Andrews', 'most', 'difficult', 'adjustment', 'coming', 'home', 'wife', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'had', 'plainly', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'absence', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'vets', 'will', 'quickly', 'surmise', 'Jody', 'had', 'been', 'around', 'One', 'aches', 'Andrews', 'work', 'cloying', 'drug', 'store', 'unable', 'find', 'better', 'spot', 'are', 'few', 'jobs', 'ex', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'March', 'most', 'nuanced', 'role', 'old', 'married', 'man', 'wife', 'kids', 'wife', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'strong', 'faithful', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'March', 'too', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'returning', 'bank', 'job', 'Credit', 'grandfatherly', 'boss', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'not', 'only', 'holding', 'job', 'also', 'handing', 'promotion', 'March', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'struggle', 'bottle', 'lucky', 'man', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'boss', 'patient', 'wife', 'March', 'support', 'can', 'get', 'when', 'unhappily', 'married', 'Andrews', 'involved', 'daughter', 'good', 'girl', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'most', 'interesting', 'role', 'Russell', 'Wounded', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'was', 'attacked', 'was', 'discovered', 'Director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'War', 'Bond', 'rally', 'most', 'touching', 'moment', 'BY', 'when', 'Russell', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Cathy', 'O', 'Donnell', 'how', 'hand', 'hooks', 'work', 'BY', 'swept', '1946', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Wyler', 'Best', 'Actor', 'March', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Russell', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Dramatic', 'Score', 'Russell', 'was', 'also', 'given', 'Special', 'Award', 'bringing', 'hope', 'courage', 'fellow', 'veterans', 'only', 'actor', 'receive', '2', 'awards', 'same', 'role', 'too', 'bad', 'Andrews', 'Loy', 'went', 'empty', 'handed', 'quietly', 'played', 'roles', 'perfection', 'especially', 'Loy', 'dealing', 'hard', 'husband', 'struggling', 'settle', 'down', 'final', 'compliment', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'Andrew', 'bad', 'girl', 'wife', 'hard', 'playing', 'witchy', 'woman', 'virtual', 'perfection', 'Viewers', 'should', 'observe', 'Wyler', 'camera', 'work', 'BY', 'shot', 'deep', 'focus', 'almost', 'always', 'action', 'rear', 'scene', 'especially', 'awful', 'drugstore', 'Credit', 'Mike', 'Mayo', 'War', 'Movies', 'observation', 'background', 'Mr.', 'Russell', 'BY', 'highly', 'recommended', 'way', 'were', 'very', 'special', 'time', 'country', 'history', 'Amazoners', 'are', 'encouraged', 'devote', '165', 'minutes', 'watching', 'beauty', 'video', 'one', 'can', 'watch', '2', '3', 'sittings', 'reviewer', 'was', 'tempted', 'deduct', 'star', 'absolutely', 'hokey', 'fadeout', 'not', 'divulged', 'here', 'happy', 'endings', 'please', 'Still', 'viewers', 'must', 'not', 'let', 'silly', '30', 'seconds', 'detract', '164.5', 'minutes', 'Hollywood', 'gold']",The Best Years of Our Lives

It's good to know that it was appreciated when it was released, over 60 years ago, winning so many Oscars. A great and moving story (it's schmatlz only adds to it). For the most part it's very well acted too, creating great sympathy for the characters.The plot is well described elsewhere here, but there were several things in it I found very interesting pieces of social history.One is the information regarding some actual salaries of 1946. These included the wages of an Air Force bombadier, a bank VP and soda jerk. I was amazed at how high the first two were. Another notable thing is the general tone of worry about the future with high unemployment, economic worries  and a dread of the ""next war when we'll all be killed"". The opinion was also voiced that ""we just fought the wrong enemy"". This at a time when the US was the sole possessor of nuclear weapons and about to start the biggest economic boom in it history.

155503,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,0792846133,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[6, 7]","Without a shred of doubt World War II has become one of the perennial subjects of the modern mega-motion picture era. Within the last three decades the Motion Picture Association has rewarded numerous films which relate to the Second World War with the recognition of either being nominated for or winning a golden statuette, among those include The Last Emperor, Patton, The English Patient, and Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg who also helmed the Academy Award-winning Schindler's List. In spite of losing out on Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love, Spielberg enthusiasm for the subject of World War II gave rise to the HBO mini-series, Band of Brothers, which he produced along with Tom Hanks, garnering numerous Emmy awards in its wake. Even cult-director Quentin Tarantino, the man behind such classics as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, will be getting into the act with his next film, Inglorious Bastards. But what few filmmakers, let alone the studio executives willing to produce them, have taken the actual time to create a film focused on the returning soldier to the life he left behind when he went off to war and how war changes everything, even long after the guns have silenced.The story for The Best Years of Our Lives, with its flagrantly honest dialogue and emotionally gripping situations, stands out prominently amongst other films of the war genre, both today and the time period in which it was released. Unlike other war pictures, which frequently rely on ordinary individuals being thrown into intense situations, or vice-versa, this film's primary interest lies with three ordinary men, whose only interest in the war was to perform to the best of their ability the duty which was required of them from both their families and their country, readjusting themselves to their former lifestyles and the difficulties they encounter through this transitional period in their lives. Few if any truly nullifying comments can be made directly about the script or its storyline, but one which can be suggested is that its three hour time length feels a bit much to handle within one sitting and the events which are spaced out quite a bit over the course of the film could have easily been condensed into a more reasonably-sized movie.Having been produced and released in time to be recognized by the Motion Picture Association in 1946, a little over a year since World War II officially ended with the surrender of the Japanese to the United States, it is right to assume that the events which are represented within the film as well as the styles and the fashions of the time are depicted accurately. But what needs to be addressed more carefully goes beyond the level of merely analyzing clothing and trends of this particular era in American history and involves the way in which the veterans returning home from the war are depicted.With a little over fifteen months under their belt following the end of the war, it is hard to believe that the filmmakers in this time period were able to write up a script, arrange for the studio to produce it, film the project, edit it, distribute the reels to theaters, and release the feature within that short span of time. It is more like that at least a portion of the film's production, script-writing or casting, were done prior to the official end of the global conflict. The audience, not to mention the message which the film expresses concerning veterans readjusting to the home-front, may have benefited more from the experience had it been completed over a period of years following the conclusion of the Second World War. This would have allowed the screenwriters to have accurately depicted the experiences of soldiers returning to civilian life and the long-term difficulties they encountered.Fredric March undoubtedly steals the spotlight away, for at least the first one-third of the picture, from anyone else within the cast in the often bumbling, yet still paternalistic and lovable, role of Al Stephenson, the former banker who returns home to his wife and two children and must adjust to civilian life after the war. Sadly, as entertaining as March's performance was in providing ample amounts of comic-relief early on within the picture, it does take quite a bit of time for a point to be made concerning his character and even then it remains difficult for its audience to determine exactly what is being distinguished between him and veterans similar to his state following the war.Dana Andrews provides an admirable performance in the role of Fred Derry, a fighter-pilot in the war who returns home to find that his wife has relocated to an apartment and interacts with him in such a manner which demands of him to immediately pick up where life left off without so much as an afterthought as to his experiences in the war. In spite of his performance, Andrews' appearance comes off as too ""pretty boyish"", which makes it difficult for a majority of war veterans who were not Clark Gable or Elvis Presley returning from conflict to easily connect with his character. Furthermore, he was not altogether convincing within a specific scene in the film in which he dreams about his experiences in combative aerial battles and the horrifying images of comrades being shot down or burning up in their cockpits which were burned into his mind. Fault partially lies with the screenwriters, as they limit the discussion of the topic to only a few scenes, some of which it is barely mentioned outside of passing conversation, and truly should have been divulged into more then it was. What can a modern-war veteran, from either Iraq or Afghanistan, derive from the character of Fred Derry which would benefit in their return to civilian life? Are the filmmakers trying to suggest that every soldier who marries his sweetheart before heading off to battle will deeply regret upon his return? It would be rash as to associate the intentions of the screenwriters with the assumptions picked up in the film, it is certainly intriguing to consider.Easily one of the most heralding performances in the film is given by Harold Russell, a real life veteran of World War II who lost his hands in the service of his country, for his role as Homer Parrish, a man returning home from war to face the trials of his new condition which await him upon being reunited with his loved ones. In having an actual serviceman of the Second World War fill into the role of the most gripping and emotionally demanding performances in the film, as far as the audience is concerned, benefits both the picture as a whole as well as the actor who portrays him. It would be quite intriguing, not to mention invaluable to the audiences watching this film, to discover how much of Homer Parrish's dialogue or actions throughout the picture were scripted or were improvised by Russell, a person who would clearly have more to express within the role far beyond anything the screenwriters could ever dictate for him. The lone complaint which could be made relating to the character of Homer Parrish does not concern Russell's performance but rather the way in which the screenwriters' crafted the character throughout the script. In spite of the insight its audience gains from limiting the point-of-view of Homer's adjustment to life with his recent disability to the serviceman himself, the film certainly could have broadened the perspective of the situation by including the actions and emotional thoughts of his girlfriend, Wilma, but its exclusion does not necessarily hamper its affect on the audience.Overall, The Best Years of Our Lives is truly a sight for the sore eyes of those who have become so accustomed to the clich&eacute;d dramatics of the Hollywood war picture, back in the time it was released as well as today. The film lacks nearly every single aspect one would associate with a tinsel town show stopper - star power, glitz, glamour, that certain ""movie magic"" - but in eminent defiance of the odds it performs brilliantly without them. There are those who would raise complaint that the film's atmosphere is overtly pessimistic, but there would certainly be greater disapproval had the filmmakers chosen a more ""rose-colored"" approach to the sensitive material presented. True, there is a lot to be upset about in this picture, whether it is unfair or simply as aspect of life we must learn to accept and move on, but thankfully enough room is left at the end for the characters onscreen to glimpse the horizon ahead and realize that hope is not as far away as it may seem. The cinematography is positively breathtaking, the performances conducted by a group of nearly unknown actors and actresses are brilliantly superb, the dialogue is insightful and expressive, and its message of optimism and hope in the eyes of the returning war veteran truly stands the test of time, as relevant today as it was back then.",4,The Moose Hole - A Classic for Every Era,1113955200,"04

155504,A1FG91CM8221X1,0792846133,Miles D. Moore,"[21, 21]","Much has been made recently about ""The Greatest Generation,"" the generation that came of age during the deprivation of the Great Depression and the horrors of World War II. (Having parents who were both born in 1920, and who both served their country during WWII, I believe the title of ""The Greatest Generation"" is utterly appropriate.) It may have been ""Saving Private Ryan"" that brought that generation's struggles to the forefront of their children's and grandchildren's minds; but, for my money, the best film about those who fought WWII came out only one year after the war's end. ""The Best Years of Our Lives""--directed by William Wyler, that sanest and most humane of directors--is the deeply moving story of an infantry sergeant, an Air Force pilot and a sailor returning to their Midwestern home town from the war, and how the war changed them for better and for worse. Al (Fredric March), the sergeant, is a well-to-do bank executive who finds that his Army experience has greatly changed his perception of the people who come to his bank for a loan. Fred (Dana Andrews) finds life at home stultifying after service in a combat squadron, stuck in his old dead-end job as a soda jerk with a wife who has grown away from him. Most poignant of all is Homer, a young sailor who lost his hands in combat. Homer is played by Harold Russell, a real-life double amputee, who gives Homer's feelings of loss and displacement a you-are-there immediacy that is truly heartrending. Giving performances of equal excellence to the three male leads are Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright as March's wife and daughter; Virginia Mayo as Andrews' faithless wife; and Cathy O'Donnell as the girl Russell left behind. (The look on Loy's face when she first sees her husband home safely makes for one of the most moving scenes in all American cinema.) Literate and character-driven, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" never tries to dazzle us; it just brings home the reality of these characters and their predicaments with quietly devastating force. This film won seven Oscars and deserved every last one of them, including Best Picture, Best Director for Wyler, Best Actor for March and Best Supporting Actor for Russell. It is amazing that so measured and insightful a film about the plight of returning GIs could have been filmed so soon after the war; but ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is an enduring and fitting monument to America's servicemen and servicewomen, the sacrifices they make for their country, and the debt their country owes them.",5,Still the greatest movie about The Greatest Generation.,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,2527,"['Much', 'been', 'made', 'recently', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'generation', 'came', 'age', 'deprivation', 'Great', 'Depression', 'horrors', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Having', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'born', '1920', 'who', 'served', 'country', 'WWII', 'believe', 'title', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'utterly', 'appropriate', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'brought', 'generation', 'struggles', 'forefront', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'minds', 'money', 'best', 'film', 'who', 'fought', 'WWII', 'came', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'war', 'end', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'sanest', 'most', 'humane', 'directors', 'deeply', 'moving', 'story', 'infantry', 'sergeant', 'Air', 'Force', 'pilot', 'sailor', 'returning', 'Midwestern', 'home', 'town', 'war', 'how', 'war', 'changed', 'better', 'worse', 'Al', 'Fredric', 'March', 'sergeant', 'well-to-do', 'bank', 'executive', 'who', 'Army', 'experience', 'greatly', 'changed', 'perception', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'bank', 'loan', 'Fred', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'life', 'home', 'stultifying', 'service', 'combat', 'squadron', 'stuck', 'old', 'dead-end', 'job', 'soda', 'jerk', 'wife', 'who', 'grown', 'away', 'Most', 'poignant', 'Homer', 'young', 'sailor', 'who', 'lost', 'hands', 'combat', 'Homer', 'played', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'real-life', 'double', 'amputee', 'who', 'Homer', 'feelings', 'loss', 'displacement', 'you-are-there', 'immediacy', 'truly', 'heartrending', 'Giving', 'performances', 'equal', 'excellence', 'three', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'March', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'Andrews', 'faithless', 'wife', 'Cathy', ""O'Donnell"", 'girl', 'Russell', 'left', 'behind', 'look', 'Loy', 'face', 'when', 'first', 'husband', 'home', 'safely', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'American', 'cinema', 'Literate', 'character-driven', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'never', 'dazzle', 'just', 'home', 'reality', 'characters', 'predicaments', 'quietly', 'devastating', 'force', 'film', 'won', 'seven', 'Oscars', 'deserved', 'last', 'one', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Wyler', 'Best', 'Actor', 'March', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Russell', 'amazing', 'so', 'measured', 'insightful', 'film', 'plight', 'returning', 'GIs', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'so', 'soon', 'war', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'enduring', 'fitting', 'monument', 'America', 'servicemen', 'servicewomen', 'sacrifices', 'make', 'country', 'debt', 'country']",The Best Years of Our Lives

Also on the same theme - how people who were below you when you left for the war are now your boss, how the people who were left behind don't understand you, and how the terrible memories of the war still haunt you. Even the isolationist policies of some Americans are criticised in the form of an agitator who gets his ""just desserts"".

155524,A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP,0792846133,Phil Berardelli,"[3, 3]","The great director Billy Wilder, who once quipped that he could laugh during ""Hamlet,"" marveled at how he found himself bawling shamelessly at one of the earliest scenes in this movie. And legendary actress Bette Davis called this the best movie ever made in Hollywood. Possibly, but it's even more than that. This story of three veterans returning home after World War II seemed to resonate with the feelings of the entire country at the time. (It certainly mirrored the experiences of my own parents, who met briefly before the U.S. Army Engineers sent Dad overseas in 1942 and he fell in love with Mom during their three-and-a-half years of separation through their letters. They married two months after he returned home in December 1945.) It was a box-office blockbuster in 1946, easily eclipsing ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Frankly, the acting is not great in this movie, and some of the dialogue isn't, either. But director William Wyler managed to transcend those weaknesses and evoke deeply felt sentiments without seeming manipulative or cloying. You really can't help choking back tears and rooting for all of the characters to resettle and succeed. Most memorable is Harold Russell, who had lost both arms nearly up to his elbows in a non-combat accident. He plays Homer Parrish, a disabled veteran. Not a trained actor, Russell easily matches pros Frederic March, Dana Andrews and Myrna Loy with his screen presence. Virginia Mayo is wonderful as a lively and decidedly unsympathetic wife.

The men who served overseas in the war came home to a hero's welcome and seemed to have the world at their feet.  That rosy scene of hero worship faded and the men had to cope with coming back to the routine of normal life and the remembrances of the horror of war.  The Best Years of Our Lives examines how three men from a small Midwestern town deal with returning home from the war.  Frederic March is sterling as a husband and father of two who spirals down into melancholy and depression.  Dana Andrews is a dashing bombardier who at home is reduced to working as a soda jerk and whose wife parties all the time and lives beyond their means.  Harold Russell was a real veteran of war and first time actor.  Mr. Russell lost both of his hands in combat and he provides realism to his role that no actor could give as he actually went through the trials and tribulations he faced in the film.  Instead of a being a rah-rah, war is a great and happy experience film, the movie shows the dark side and ill effects war has on people.  It is a powerful and moving film that still resonates over a half century later.  The film walked away with seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director for the legendary William Wyler, Best Actor for Mr. March and two Oscars for Mr. Russell, one for Supporting actor and a special award for the role, thus becoming the only person to win two awards for the same role in the same year.",5,Powerful Drama,1007683200,"12 7, 2001",2001,1534,"['Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'was', 'released', '1946', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'men', 'who', 'served', 'overseas', 'war', 'came', 'home', 'hero', 'welcome', 'seemed', 'have', 'world', 'feet', 'rosy', 'scene', 'hero', 'worship', 'faded', 'men', 'had', 'cope', 'coming', 'back', 'routine', 'normal', 'life', 'remembrances', 'horror', 'war', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'examines', 'how', 'three', 'men', 'small', 'Midwestern', 'town', 'deal', 'returning', 'home', 'war', 'Frederic', 'March', 'sterling', 'husband', 'father', 'two', 'who', 'spirals', 'down', 'melancholy', 'depression', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'dashing', 'bombardier', 'who', 'home', 'reduced', 'working', 'soda', 'jerk', 'wife', 'parties', 'time', 'lives', 'means', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'was', 'real', 'veteran', 'war', 'first', 'time', 'actor', 'Mr.', 'Russell', 'lost', 'hands', 'combat', 'realism', 'role', 'actor', 'could', 'give', 'actually', 'went', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'faced', 'film', 'Instead', 'being', 'rah-rah', 'war', 'great', 'happy', 'experience', 'film', 'movie', 'dark', 'side', 'ill', 'effects', 'war', 'people', 'powerful', 'moving', 'film', 'still', 'half', 'century', 'later', 'film', 'walked', 'away', 'seven', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'legendary', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Mr.', 'March', 'two', 'Oscars', 'Mr.', 'Russell', 'one', 'Supporting', 'actor', 'special', 'award', 'role', 'thus', 'becoming', 'only', 'person', 'win', 'two', 'awards', 'same', 'role', 'same', 'year']",The Best Years of Our Lives

The story involves the adjustments military men have to make when they come home.  (This was before we knew about post-traumatic stress disorder.) Surely the men and now, women, who are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan will each have their own stories.William Wyler must have been a terrific director for actors because he got such spontaneous, naturalistic moments from this cast.  I found this quality of acting unusual in a film of that time.  The cast is terrific--each one gives a deeply moving performance.  Myrna Loy is so charming and at once sophisticated and sweet, tender and tough.  She makes you think about what the wives who were left at home to raise their children alone had to cope with.  Harold Russell's performance, as others have said here, is worth the price of the DVD.  I knew nothing of him, if he was a real amputee, a professional actor, or what, until I read the reviews.  He has an amazingly open, beautiful face and the sunniest smile you'll ever want to see.  The marriage scene which shows each detail of the hands, clasping each other, giving the ring, brought tears to my eyes!Dana Andrews is great as the young, carefree, ex-soda jerk who married a blonde bombshell but comes to realize he may have made a mistake.  Frederick March is wonderful, too, as the ex-banker who returns to face a wonderful family, but there are still problems.  We see that he drinks too much and this is probably the only problem that isn't spelled out and resolved.  Teresa Wright is luminous as his grown daughter who falls in love with Dana Andrews.  I have found her acting a bit sappy in other films but here it rings true.  Virgina Mayo is gorgous and certainly convincing as the girl who just wants to have fun.I really enjoyed the appearance of Hoagy Carmichael, a very cool guy, who gives additional class to this film.It plays for three hours and I was glued to the screen for the entire time.

Some, like Hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and Hopper's &quot;Easy Rider&quot; tell the story of a segment of a generation.  However, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; eloquently tells the story of Americans at the end of World War II.  The story is told through three returning veterans who come home together.  Before their flight takes off, one of them wanders through a &quot;graveyard&quot; of military planes.  The vastness of this airfield of defunct military equiptment brings home the message; the war's over and there's no further need for its' &quot;leftovers&quot;.  The soldier can either move on or become another &quot;leftover&quot;.  However, moving on is not all that easy to do.  Not after you've been through what these three men have been through.Ironicly, the sailor, played by Harold Russell, laments that he didn't see any action.  The pilot and the soldier look at his two missing arms questioningly.  Russell was, himself, a returning disabled vet and he won a special Oscar for his inspiring preformance.  His role served as a reminder that it wasn't only the front-line troops that that came home with scars.The three servicemen represent three different types of enlistees.  The men who entered the services right out of school, the ones who were called as they were starting out in the world on their own, and those who left behind an established career.  In turn, the ones they came home to represnted three different scenarios.  The young sailor comes home to his high school sweetheart.  She knows that this is not the boy who left her.  She is ready to love the man who returned in his place if she can figure out who he is.  The pilot came home to the woman he married just before he left for war.  He discovers that she had married a uniform and wasn't the least bit interested in what was inside it.  The third homecoming is to an established household of many years were there was still some uncertainty.All three men found their perspectives radically changed by their absence and their experiences.  The ultimate question for each of them to answer was the meaning of the movie's title.  What were &quot;the best years of our lives&quot;?  Were they they years of dedicated military service that they sacrificed for their country?  Or were they the lives they came home to.

155533,AA80KHOR4NQ1I,0792846133,Raymond D. Farmer,"[8, 71]","I had long wanted to see this movie.  It's supposed to be one of the best ever.  However, all I could think of as I watched it was what how much better a modern version could be.As a snapshot of America immediately after the end of World War II, it is valuable.  You see the hardships of the soldiers and sailors as they try to reassimilate themselves in civilian society.  You see characters deal with renewing ties with family they hadn't seen in years; you see a marriage fail; you see love triumph over tragedy.You can also view the film as a historical document about film-making itself in 1946.  From the background music to the cadence of the actors' voices, this is what a great movie in 1946 sounded like.  From the smiling faces superimposed over neon night club signs to the deep, dark fades between scenes, this is what a great movie in 1946 looked like.  But that's the problem.  The movie is more enjoyable as a piece of American history than as an entertaining film.One of my biggest complaints is about Harold Russell.  He plays a sailor returning home after having lost both hands in a fire.  The fact that Russell truly was a veteran who had lost both hands during the war brings life to the role.  His is the most interesting part of the story, because you feel this must have been exactly what it was like for Russell.  He is obviously a remarkable man, but he is a poor actor.  The movie wouldn't be the same without him, but it was difficult for me to overlook a bungled line or an awkward expression.  The academy did not find that so difficult, voting him an Oscar for supporting actor, as well as a special award for being an inspiration to others.  The second was well deserved.The other actors in significant roles are fine.  They just have that mid-40s style.  It worked then, and works now if you have a taste for the nostalgic.And I must say something about the final line of dialogue in the movie.  It is delivered by Dana Andrews.  It's something like, &quot;We'll get kicked around some.&quot;  It seems like a very awkward line with which to end the film.  It feels as if he is in mid-thought, and the tone of his voice leads you to feel he is about to say something more.  But the movie ends there, like a great symphony that reaches a musical climax, then doesn't resolve the final chord properly.  We know what the final line of a movie should sound like, and this is not it.  The disonance of the line rang in my ears as the scene faded to the credits.I do believe this is a movie that could be successfully remade.  The dialogue could be improved, be made more realistic.  It would not have to be the gritty, low-brow language that is all-too-common in today's movies, but it's obvious that the writers here were restricted by what was allowable in films almost 60 years ago.  I guess we'd end up with a 21st century interpretation of what returning from WWII was like.

The story follows 3 servicemen from the same hometown who are going home after World War II and how they adapt to their lives once they are out of uniform.  The movie is in black and white...yes, I know the cover of the CD is in color - but it is in black/white.  It's a long movie with lots of depth, character study, and interwoven stories.Dana Andrews comes back to a wife who loves seeing him in a uniform and she just wants life to be a big party.  Frederic March comes back to his wife, Myrna Loy, and 2 children and adjusts to working at the bank again and understanding that his kids are grown adults.  Lastly, Harold Russell comes back with both hands missing and replaced with hooks.  He has to deal with the girlfriend he left behind and his parents who have a hard time coping with his handicap.The script is very clever, honest, and beautifully written.  It's one of the more honest movies in showing just a portion of what the servicemen had to deal with fighting in the War and coming home to a &#34;new&#34; and different home that they left.This movie won 7 Oscars in 1947 for Best Movie, Best Director, Best Actor (Frederic March), Best Actor in Supporting Role (Harold Russell), Best Screenplay, etc.The acting is incredible because the story being told is incredible.

This intimate engagement with the psychological facts of American life gave it an almost universal audience... But, unlike contemporary and preceding ""message"" pictures, it was not a preachment... It showed Americans as they are, presented their problems as they themselves see them, and provided only such solutions--partial, temporary, personal--as they themselves would accept... The picture's values are the values of the people in it...William Wyler, an outstanding director, triple winner of the best picture Oscar, adds an air of distinction to melodrama, epic and Westerns... With his distinguishing visual style and his taste for solemn material, he gained a reputation as a meticulous, serious artist... Wyler's most adept use of deep-focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content...The film tells the story of three men coming home from war to a small middle-American community, and find it variously difficult to pick up where they left off... The three heroes are: a middle-aged sergeant (Fredric March), magnificent as the devoted family man who succeeds in breaking the ice with his family; an incisive Air Force captain (Dana Andrews) returning to an unfaithful wife; and a tormented sailor (Harold Russell) who has lost both hands in service, replaced by hooks in real life...Winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is eloquent and compassionate, a deeply personal motion picture with touching wordless homecoming scenes:- The first words of the sergeant's loving wife when he arrives home unexpectedly: ""I look terrible! It isn't fair of you to burst in on us like this.""- The involuntarily sob of the sailor's mother when she first sees her son's mechanical hands... She blurts out: ""It's nothing!""With her dry-martini voice, Myrna Loy combines charmingly her wifely qualities with motherly ones; Teresa Wright is lovely as the sergeant's nice daughter who falls in love with the pilot; Virginia Mayo is harsh as the disloyal flashy blonde wife whose first loves are money and high life; and Cathy O'Donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the sailor's fianc&eacute;e...The situations and even some of the characters seem a little obvious, but this is a superb example of high-quality film-making in the forties, with smiles and tears cunningly spaced and a film which says what is needed on a vital subject...",4,A deeply personal motion picture...,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,2693,"['American', 'masterpiece', 'came', 'near', 'perfection', 'popular', 'art', 'contrives', 'be', 'beautifully', 'equivocal', 'suggestive', 'title', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'elicited', 'William', 'Wyler', 'nonprofessional', 'amputee', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'film', 'epitomized', 'dream', 'reality', 'postwar', 'world', 'intimate', 'engagement', 'psychological', 'facts', 'American', 'life', 'gave', 'almost', 'universal', 'audience', 'contemporary', 'preceding', 'message', 'pictures', 'was', 'not', 'preachment', 'showed', 'Americans', 'are', 'presented', 'problems', 'see', 'provided', 'only', 'such', 'solutions', 'partial', 'temporary', 'personal', 'would', 'accept', 'picture', 'values', 'are', 'values', 'people', 'William', 'Wyler', 'outstanding', 'director', 'triple', 'winner', 'best', 'picture', 'Oscar', 'air', 'distinction', 'melodrama', 'epic', 'Westerns', 'distinguishing', 'visual', 'style', 'taste', 'solemn', 'material', 'gained', 'reputation', 'meticulous', 'serious', 'artist', 'Wyler', 'most', 'adept', 'use', 'deep-focus', 'reveals', 'real', 'commitment', 'emotional', 'content', 'film', 'story', 'three', 'men', 'coming', 'home', 'war', 'small', 'middle-American', 'community', 'find', 'variously', 'difficult', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'three', 'heroes', 'are', 'middle-aged', 'sergeant', 'Fredric', 'March', 'magnificent', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'breaking', 'ice', 'family', 'incisive', 'Air', 'Force', 'captain', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'returning', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'tormented', 'sailor', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'who', 'lost', 'hands', 'service', 'replaced', 'hooks', 'real', 'life', 'Winner', '7', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'eloquent', 'compassionate', 'deeply', 'personal', 'motion', 'picture', 'touching', 'wordless', 'homecoming', 'scenes', 'first', 'words', 'sergeant', 'loving', 'wife', 'when', 'home', 'unexpectedly', 'look', 'terrible', ""n't"", 'fair', 'burst', 'involuntarily', 'sob', 'sailor', 'mother', 'when', 'first', 'son', 'mechanical', 'hands', 'out', 'nothing', 'dry-martini', 'voice', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'combines', 'charmingly', 'wifely', 'qualities', 'motherly', 'ones', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'lovely', 'sergeant', 'nice', 'daughter', 'who', 'love', 'pilot', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'harsh', 'disloyal', 'flashy', 'blonde', 'wife', 'first', 'loves', 'are', 'money', 'high', 'life', 'Cathy', ""O'Donnell"", 'wonderful', 'sensitive', 'sailor', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'situations', 'even', 'characters', 'seem', 'little', 'obvious', 'superb', 'example', 'high-quality', 'film-making', 'forties', 'smiles', 'tears', 'cunningly', 'spaced', 'film', 'what', 'needed', 'vital', 'subject']",The Best Years of Our Lives

The soldiers that returned home faced a similar situation as the veterans from WWI. They found their jobs had been taken, their outlook on life had changed, and sometimes their families had been dismantled. The Best Years of Our Lives addresses the return home from war and the affects combat had on their daily lives. We follow Al Stephenson (Frederick March) home to his wife (Myrna Loy) and daughter (Teresa Wright). Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns to his new wife (Virginia Mayo). Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) comes home without hands and startles his family and fiancee Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).This film is a long and indepth look at the readjustment from a soldier's life to a civilian's life. We see the men returning to work, the disappointments that they face, and the changes they make. The movie has romance, heartache, and comedy which makes it appealing to a variety of audiences. This is one of those movies that was obviously made to contend for the Oscars; it won Samuel Goldwyn his first for best picture. It features a talented cast and well-written characters, and the direction is supurb.

As much as I love Capra's &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; I can have no regrets that virtually all of the academy awards for 1946 were given to Wyler's rather than Capra's film.  Nowhere has deep-focus photography (courtesy of Greg Toland) been employed more effectively in cinema and in no film is there a musical score as exhilarating yet complementary as that provided by Hugo Friedhofer.  Although the cinematography, editing, and music are in many respects the true stars of this masterwork, the acting certainly rises to the occasion, particularly the perfomances of Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Teresa Wright.  And, of course, the casting of Harold Russell, an ordinary citizen-navyman who had lost both hands in the war, was and remains one of the most brilliant calls in Hollywood history.  Far from a period piece about WW II, the film remains a living treasure that should be required viewing for anyone interested in the power of cinema at its purest.",5,The American Odyssey,977443200,"12 22, 2000",2000,1185,"['been', 'said', 'Homer', 'quot', 'Odyssey', 'quot', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'named', 'quot', 'Homecoming.', 'quot', 'Wyler', 'film', 'homecoming', 'experiences', 'not', 'one', 'three', 'veterans', 'second', 'World', 'War', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'Capra', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'can', 'have', 'regrets', 'virtually', 'academy', 'awards', '1946', 'were', 'given', 'Wyler', 'rather', 'Capra', 'film', 'Nowhere', 'deep-focus', 'photography', 'courtesy', 'Greg', 'Toland', 'been', 'employed', 'more', 'effectively', 'cinema', 'film', 'there', 'musical', 'score', 'exhilarating', 'yet', 'complementary', 'provided', 'Hugo', 'Friedhofer', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'music', 'are', 'many', 'respects', 'true', 'stars', 'masterwork', 'acting', 'certainly', 'occasion', 'particularly', 'perfomances', 'Fredric', 'March', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'course', 'casting', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'ordinary', 'citizen-navyman', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'hands', 'war', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'calls', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'Far', 'period', 'piece', 'WW', 'II', 'film', 'living', 'treasure', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'interested', 'power', 'cinema', 'purest']",The Best Years of Our Lives
155552,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,0792846133,Sean Pasek,"[12, 12]","The Best Years of Our Lives is a film that seems to transcend time itself.  This is one of the best films ever made.  A rich ensemble cast and a compelling, touching story make this a film to treasure and invites repeated viewings, and it isn't hard to see why it won Best Picture in 1946 as well as a high mark on AFI's best films ever made.The film surrounds three men who are just returning from World War II.  They are Air Force Captain, Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), Sergeant Al Stephenson (Fredric March), and Navy Shipman, Homer Dobkins (Harold Russell).  The film's central plot issue is how these three men are able to re-incorporate themselves back into society.Fred Derry finds the challenges of getting re-acquainted with his new wife, wonderfully played by Virginia Mayo, and finding a good job, as he was a soda-fountain man before he entered the war.  He also has an estranged relationship with his father who can't seem to express his admiration and affection for his son.  Dana Andrews is wonderful.  His best work is in this film and in the classic thriller, Laura.Al Stephenson find his challenges in getting re-aquainted with his family who seem to have grown away from him in the sense that his kids are grown up.  He also finds the challenge of going back to a job as a bank loan officer, a job he hasn't much enthusiasm for, as well as his tendency to drink just a bit too much!  Fredric March is simply brilliant in this film and he justly earned an Oscar for this role.Finally, there is Homer Parrish, played by real-life veteran with genuine touch and appeal by newcomer Harold Russell (the only actor in Oscar history to receive two Oscars for the same role!).  Word has it that William Wyler was so impressed and touched by Harold's true-to-life war experience which cost him his hands, that he incorporated much of Harold's own experience into the story.Our three men return to Boone City to vast changes within the town itself.  They are blown away by the commercial boom that seems to have struck.  So much progress has been made that, at first, our heroes wonder just where do they fit in.Fred quickly discovers that he really doesn't know his wife.  While attractive and appealing physically (especially to other men), he realizes that she's lacking in any real substance.  Nor, apparently, is she interested in him outside of his ""military"" uniform and position.  However, he quickly finds romance with Al Stephenson's young daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright).  He finds a young woman with genuine feeling who cares deeply for him, especially when she's awaken one night by one of Fred's nightmares.  His wife wonders why he can't just ""get it out of his system,"" while Peggy shows concern and empathy for Fred's plight.  The problem grows more complicated since Fred is married.  The budding relationship between Fred and Peggy doesn't please father Al at all who warns Fred that he will do everything to keep Peggy away from him.  Teresa Wright was one of those wonderful actresses with the perfect blend of beauty and sense of the girl next door.  She wasn't glamorous, and she never had a desire to be.  Her appeal was always in playing very sweet, down-to-earth characters.Al returns to a loving wife (Myrna Loy), Milly.  Even Milly is wondering what happened to her husband, who at seems is more interested in bar-hopping than in recapturing his romance with her.  Al discovers a promotion waiting for him at the bank, but he wonders at what cost?  Especially when he feels compelled to give a ""break"" to a young return veteran who has no collateral for his loan.  He ends up questioning just where the heart of America is.  Even while intoxicated, Al ends up giving one of the most compelling speeches about the future of America.Finally, there is Homer Parrish who just wants to be treated like everyone else.  His girlfriend, Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) tries everything she can think of to try and convince Homer that she doesn't care about his debilitating condition, but only about him.  It finally takes a true touching situation for her to finally convince him of this truth.  This is greatly amplified when he finally wraps his arms around her, and she nearly cries out with joy that he's finally done this.There have been several such films made throughout the history of Hollywood, but none have approached the touching and genuine feeling that this one does.  William Wyler is one of the best directors of all time, in my opinion, behind such classics as ""Mrs. Miniver"" and ""Ben-Hur"".  He has always done compelling and touching stories, and not many directors are able to combine these two elements so successfully.The movie is nearly 3 hours long, but it never feels like it.  We find that for these three men, the best years of their lives are yet to come because they've overcome all of the odds of war and all of the odds of coming home.",5,The Best Years Is One of the Best

Producer Samuel Goldwyn and director William Wyler collaborated with writer Robert E. Sherwood to make THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES (1946). All three won Oscars.  The film is a towering masterpiece set in small town America (actually Cleveland) right after World War Two ends.  Returning home are Al Stephenson (Fredric March) of the Army, Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) of the Air Force, and Homer Parrish (real-life double amputee and non-professional Harold Russell) of the Navy.  Al has wife Milly (Myrna Loy) and two kids, while Homer has a family and sweet girl friend Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).  Luckless Fred has a newlywed wife (Virginia Mayo) who was unfaithful while her husband was overseas.THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES burned up the 1946 Oscars, winning Picture, Director, Screenplay, March as Actor, and two for Russell.  Hugo Friedhofer's legendary score also won a richly deserved trophy.  It is a long film, 170 minutes, but beautifully paced and leisurely, capturing the slow tempo of a more quiet time.  Those wanting something fast and flashy should rent THE FRENCH CONNECTION (1971).  The performances are superb down to the bit roles.THE BEST YEARS captures to perfection the way that returning veterans wanted their old jobs back--Al at the bank, Fred in a drugstore--when other people now had those jobs and resented the vets.  The guys all keep gathering at Butch's (Hoagy Carmichael) bar to rap about life.  Meanwhile, Fred has a frustrating dilemma besides losing his drugstore job.  With an unfaithful wife who insists that her husband wear a uniform he no longer wants to wear, he finds himself drawn romantically to the Stephenson daughter (Teresa Wright).  The Stephensons do everything to stop that, partly to placate the censor board.The movie has vignettes more than a strong plot--Al being quizzed by his bank boss on why a particular loan was made, Homer and his father taking off his artificial limbs in a night bedroom, Al wandering through a field of airplanes about to become scrap metal for homes, and an especially lovely reel one scene in a plane cockpit with all three men looking down on their town.  Backing everything are Gregg Toland's stunning deep focus B&W; photography and Hugo Friedhofer's magnificent music score.The DVD transfer seems excellent, even with minimal bonuses, for one of the greatest films ever made.

155558,AK61LQI92GTCH,0792846133,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[12, 13]","A winner of seven out of the eight Academy Awards it was nominated for, 1946's THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES was the biggest box-office draw since 1939's GONE WITH THE WIND.  Unlike many old hits, though, BEST YEARS holds up remarkably well.It's hard to know where to begin when you want to praise everything.  The script is honest, and in its honesty avoids some obvious dramatic highpoints.  There are times when most movies would have troubled characters, and the three returning vets are all working through complicated readjustments, collide and explode in a Big Emotional scene.For instance: infantry sergeant/civilian banker Frederic March returns to a wife he loves and two children who have grown into young adults in his absence.  He gives his teenage son a Japanese flag and samurai sword, but the son is more interested in atomic energy and jet propulsion and whether the world is going to be blown to smithereens in the next war.  The maid left three years ago and daughter Teresa Wright has replaced her after taking a few domestic science classes.  It's not the family he left, and he registers his distress by pacing, smoking.  Sit down, dear, wife Myrna Loy says.  You'll be more comfortable.  I'm comfortable enough standing, March says.  Say, can't a fellow get a drink in this house?It was right around then, early in the movie, that I thought the film would deliver the first Big Emotional scene.  A fight between Loy and March, perhaps.  And then it fooled me.  March suggests Loy and Wright and he paint the town red to ""Let me know I'm alive.""  And away they go, visiting one nightclub after the other, March's character getting tipsier and tipsier.  The opportunity for the BE scene continued to build.Then they enter Butch's (Hoagy Carmichael) caf&eacute;. The inebriated March asks Hoagy to play an old tune and asks his wife to dance and the scene series ends with shots of them dancing, cut with medium close ups of the actors' faces radiating quiet bliss.Frankly, I think this is a brilliant movie that is almost perfectly constructed.One oddity.  Harold Russell, a real life war veteran who lost both hands in the war, won two Oscars in 1947 (the only time that's ever happened, by the way); one for Supporting Actor, and an honorary one ""For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance in The Best Years of Our Lives.""  Russell is a very good natural actor, and the scene in which he shows his fiance, played by Cathy O'Donnell, how he has to prepare for bed that is as moving as anything I've ever seen.The oddity - the extra on this disk is a theatrical trailer and Russell's character doesn't appear in it.  The trailer was probably made before the movie was released, but it seems strange that they wouldn't have included him at all.",5,Best Years of Our Lives,1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,2795,"['winner', 'seven', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'was', 'nominated', '1946', 'THE', 'BEST', 'YEARS', 'OUR', 'LIVES', 'was', 'biggest', 'box-office', 'draw', '1939', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'many', 'old', 'hits', 'though', 'BEST', 'YEARS', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well.It', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'when', 'want', 'praise', 'everything', 'script', 'honest', 'honesty', 'avoids', 'obvious', 'dramatic', 'highpoints', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'most', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'troubled', 'characters', 'three', 'returning', 'vets', 'are', 'working', 'complicated', 'readjustments', 'collide', 'explode', 'Big', 'Emotional', 'scene.For', 'instance', 'infantry', 'sergeant/civilian', 'banker', 'Frederic', 'March', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'young', 'adults', 'absence', 'teenage', 'son', 'Japanese', 'flag', 'samurai', 'sword', 'son', 'more', 'interested', 'atomic', 'energy', 'jet', 'propulsion', 'world', 'going', 'be', 'blown', 'smithereens', 'next', 'war', 'maid', 'left', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'daughter', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'replaced', 'taking', 'few', 'domestic', 'science', 'classes', 'not', 'family', 'left', 'distress', 'pacing', 'smoking', 'Sit', 'down', 'dear', 'wife', 'Myrna', 'Loy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', ""'m"", 'comfortable', 'enough', 'standing', 'March', 'Say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fellow', 'get', 'drink', 'house', 'was', 'right', 'then', 'early', 'movie', 'thought', 'film', 'would', 'deliver', 'first', 'Big', 'Emotional', 'scene', 'fight', 'Loy', 'March', 'perhaps', 'then', 'fooled', 'March', 'Loy', 'Wright', 'paint', 'town', 'red', 'Let', 'know', ""'m"", 'alive', 'away', 'go', 'visiting', 'one', 'nightclub', 'other', 'March', 'character', 'getting', 'tipsier', 'tipsier', 'opportunity', 'BE', 'scene', 'continued', 'build.Then', 'enter', 'Butch', 'Hoagy', 'Carmichael', 'caf', 'eacute', 'inebriated', 'March', 'Hoagy', 'play', 'old', 'tune', 'wife', 'dance', 'scene', 'series', 'shots', 'dancing', 'cut', 'medium', 'close', 'ups', 'actors', 'radiating', 'quiet', 'bliss.Frankly', 'think', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'constructed.One', 'oddity', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'real', 'life', 'war', 'veteran', 'who', 'lost', 'hands', 'war', 'won', 'two', 'Oscars', '1947', 'only', 'time', 'ever', 'happened', 'way', 'one', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'honorary', 'one', 'bringing', 'hope', 'courage', 'fellow', 'veterans', 'appearance', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'Russell', 'very', 'good', 'natural', 'actor', 'scene', 'fiance', 'played', 'Cathy', ""O'Donnell"", 'how', 'prepare', 'bed', 'as', 'moving', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'oddity', 'extra', 'disk', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Russell', 'character', ""n't"", 'appear', 'trailer', 'was', 'probably', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'strange', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'included']",The Best Years of Our Lives
155559,A3M0YP958H2KRX,0792846133,Steven K. Szmutko,"[3, 3]","There are very few movies which capture the drama of an entire generation.  THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, directed by William Wyler, is one of those movies.  Its graceful examination of three returning World War II veterans to small-town America captures the essence of the ""Greatest Generation.""Almost everyone of that generation with whom I have spoken, including my parents and their friends, agree that the film accurately depicts the challenges of returning veterans, seeking to reenter previous jobs, recover from devastating injuries and move in different directions, never anticipated in pre-war lives.Stellar performances abound with accomplished actors such as Frederic March, Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy, Virginia Mayo and musician Hoagy Carmichael. Teresa Wright (a/k/a Lou Gehrig's wife in THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES) offers a fresh innocence representative young women at the time.  But the greatest performance (in my opinion) is from Harold Russell, a veteran and double-amputee, who plays Homer Parrish, the former small-town football hero who seeks to cope with his handicap as well as his own insecurities.  Mr. Russell won two Academy Awards, one honorary award for his inspiration to returning vets, and a Best Supporting Oscar.  The latter was often considered by some to be the result of a sympathy vote.  However, his portrayal of the young Homer is heartbreakingly brilliant by any standard.There are some who have lamented the poor DVD quality.  I do not know if this was a comment on a previous release or a problem with individual DVDs.  I found both the visual and audio quality of the movie to be excellent; it was as if I were watching the film in the theater for the first time.This is one of those rare films that can be watched over and over again.

155562,A34D9Q0JTF7N7K,0792846133,Susan,"[4, 4]","I have recently discovered Fredric March and have collected over 40 of his films. He was a wonderful actor, and I am amazed at how forgotten he has become. I mention his name to people, and they say ""Fredric who?"". This man was one of the greatest actors Hollywood ever had. Seeing  him in this film will only begin to tell the story. Yes, he won his 2nd Oscar for this performance; he won his first in 1932 for ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (another great MUST SEE of Fredric's films). He should have won for his portrayal of Willie Loman in ""Death of a Salesman""... in 1951, but Bogart got it instead for ""African Queen"". Anyway, all the other reviews tell you what this movie is about. It is a very good story and all the actors and actresses do a great job. Fred is great in his drunk scene...he often had to play drunks in his films and he was always impressive. Myrna Loy plays his patient and oh so loving wife. She hasn't seen him in 4 yrs.at least, and he comes home, takes them out partying, and while dancing,after having more than a few too many, he says to her, ""You know, you remind me of my wife"". She calmly plays along, saying, ""You never told me you were married."" It is a sweet scene. I do not get that he was ever unfaithful to his wife. I felt he loved her deeply. Myrna just stood by him and loved him, she was a wonderful example to me of how to be a loving wife. I liked Theresa Wright as the daughter, and Dana Andrews was great too. Virginia Mayo played a woman you hope you will never be to a man, or hope that your daughter will never be...just selfish and out for fun and a good time. She was a very shallow person. You felt sorry for her. This film has the honor to be in the list of the top 100 films...it is truly a classic and a well told story. I love WW2 history and reading about the war, and so this film sits well with me for that reason too. America went through some great changes socially and economically after the war; this film tells us how some of the people had to deal with the begining of this great cultural upheaval, as well as their own personal readjustment.

Set in a large, fictional, midwestern city, the film tracks the troubles of three veterans as they return to civilian life. Russell is so impressive because he was the real thing...a non-actor amputee vet. The movie is worth seeing for him alone. The Hollywood pros, of course, do good jobs in their roles as well. If your parents or grandparents were young adults in the post-war 1940's, this film will help you understand their experiences. It is fascinating, too, for the cars, the airplanes, the jobs, the courtship rules, and the relation of young adult vets to their parents or partners after years of separation. I think every adult citizen should see it at least once. We have wounded vets returning from war experiences every day in the USA in 2006, and while the nature of work and relationships have changed tremendously in the past 60 years, the fears and joys and hopes and challenges are largely the same.",4,"It was a landmark film, back in its day...",1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,1152,"['think', 'Best', 'Years', 'now', 'terribly', 'dated', 'always', 'been', 'overlong', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'here', 'especially', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'portrayal', 'Homer', 'double-amputee', 'who', 'must', 'return', 'WWII', 'artificial', 'hands', 'Set', 'large', 'fictional', 'midwestern', 'city', 'film', 'troubles', 'three', 'veterans', 'return', 'civilian', 'life', 'Russell', 'so', 'impressive', 'was', 'real', 'thing', 'non-actor', 'amputee', 'vet', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'alone', 'Hollywood', 'pros', 'course', 'do', 'good', 'jobs', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'were', 'young', 'adults', 'post-war', '1940', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'understand', 'experiences', 'fascinating', 'too', 'cars', 'airplanes', 'jobs', 'courtship', 'rules', 'relation', 'young', 'adult', 'vets', 'parents', 'partners', 'years', 'separation', 'think', 'adult', 'citizen', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'have', 'wounded', 'vets', 'returning', 'war', 'experiences', 'day', 'USA', '2006', 'nature', 'work', 'relationships', 'have', 'changed', 'tremendously', 'past', '60', 'years', 'fears', 'joys', 'hopes', 'challenges', 'are', 'largely', 'same']",The Best Years of Our Lives

There are no special effects.Soldiers returning to their civilian lives after combat (I am one such) can appreciate this fully.  I was wounded in combat in Iraq in '07, during ""The Surge"", and was (eventually) medevac'ed out.  We showed this in the WTB (Warrior Transition Battalion) at Ft Riley when I was assigned to it as a ""Wounded Warrior"".  This covers the entire emotional gamut, and it is the most sensitive film treatment of PTSD that I can imagine.

So many components, too many components, came together in so stunning a film it couldn't be luck, couldn't be just chance.  It's providential.  And resulting effort is sacred.William Wyler, himself a veteran, knew he needed to make this movie.  He knew he'd pour his heart and soul into the project.  His vision carried over to everyone involved.  But how could he have envisioned such a perfect score, almost transparent in the viewing, yet so integral to the emotional crescendos?  How could he foresee the power of the lighting, the editing, the cutaways, the acting synergy of such greats as Fredric Marsh, Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy, and the sublime, magical Theresa Wright?  Wyler's brilliance brought the elements together, but there was something much more at work, that created the whole.And seriously, what about Harold Russell?  How could Wyler ever, in his wildest dreams, ever envision Harold Russell?  Here's a guy who never thought about acting, a total unknown - who, through an act of providence, was thrust first into unmitigated hell; then, because Wyler saw something, was given two weeks of acting lessons and a lead part in the movie.  The result is indescribable.  Russell makes this movie.  Russell IS this movie.  He won TWO Oscars for the role and entered the annals of Hollywood lore.  His acting career all but died, but the film lives forever.And because of Russell, The Best Years Of Our Lives transcends a mere movie.  It transcends time.  It would have been relevant after the Civil War, 80 years before it was made.  It was relevant after Vietnam.  It's relevant today, 70 years after it was made.  And, God forbid we find reason to send our kids to fight wars 70 years hence, it will still be relevant.Because, ultimately, the power of the film is that it gives you, me -- all of us who weren't part of the Greatest Generation - a powerful glimpse at their sacrifice.  An intangible notion that all that we have, all that we are, is due to their sacrifice and their commitment.  That unless you were there, you can never understand what they endured, but you can appreciate all they did.  And that appreciation extends to every veteran, every kid who has made, or is making, or will ever make, that sacrifice.And that is why The Best Years of our Lives is the perennial American movie.",5,This is the Perennial American Movie,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,2349,"['so', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'So', 'many', 'components', 'too', 'many', 'components', 'came', 'together', 'so', 'stunning', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'luck', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'chance', 'providential', 'resulting', 'effort', 'sacred.William', 'Wyler', 'veteran', 'knew', 'needed', 'make', 'movie', 'knew', ""'d"", 'pour', 'heart', 'soul', 'project', 'vision', 'carried', 'everyone', 'involved', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'envisioned', 'perfect', 'score', 'almost', 'transparent', 'viewing', 'yet', 'so', 'integral', 'emotional', 'crescendos', 'How', 'could', 'foresee', 'power', 'lighting', 'editing', 'cutaways', 'acting', 'synergy', 'such', 'greats', 'Fredric', 'Marsh', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'sublime', 'magical', 'Theresa', 'Wright', 'Wyler', 'brilliance', 'brought', 'elements', 'together', 'was', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'work', 'created', 'whole.And', 'seriously', 'what', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'How', 'could', 'Wyler', 'ever', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'ever', 'envision', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'Here', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'thought', 'acting', 'total', 'unknown', 'who', 'act', 'providence', 'was', 'thrust', 'first', 'unmitigated', 'hell', 'then', 'Wyler', 'saw', 'something', 'was', 'given', 'two', 'weeks', 'acting', 'lessons', 'lead', 'part', 'movie', 'result', 'indescribable', 'Russell', 'movie', 'Russell', 'movie', 'won', 'TWO', 'Oscars', 'role', 'entered', 'annals', 'Hollywood', 'lore', 'acting', 'career', 'died', 'film', 'lives', 'forever.And', 'Russell', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'mere', 'movie', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'relevant', 'Civil', 'War', '80', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'relevant', 'Vietnam', 'relevant', 'today', '70', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'God', 'find', 'reason', 'send', 'kids', 'fight', 'wars', '70', 'years', 'hence', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'relevant.Because', 'ultimately', 'power', 'film', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'part', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'powerful', 'glimpse', 'sacrifice', 'intangible', 'notion', 'have', 'are', 'due', 'sacrifice', 'commitment', 'were', 'there', 'can', 'never', 'understand', 'what', 'endured', 'can', 'appreciate', 'did', 'appreciation', 'veteran', 'kid', 'who', 'made', 'making', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'sacrifice.And', 'why', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'perennial', 'American', 'movie']",The Best Years of Our Lives
