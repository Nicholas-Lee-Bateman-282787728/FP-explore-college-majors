After doing this tape once I let it sit unused for about a year and a half and now I have that I have started using it again I can really appreciate the poses. To explain...I have done both The Bar Method and Lotte Berk workouts and both have similarites in the ab portion to this tape in that you have to hold your back really up off the floor and hollow the belly. The other tapes really stress that you keep your ribs up off the floor and that makes all the difference in the integrity of the pose. Rodney does not really stress this point. I like this one because even though you are working the abs it is very relaxing and it's a great one to do after a really brisk walk.,4,a great ab strengthener!,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,758,"['great', 'ab', 'workout', 'think', 'Rodney', 'cueing', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'better', 'doing', 'tape', 'once', 'let', 'sit', 'unused', 'year', 'half', 'now', 'have', 'have', 'started', 'using', 'again', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'poses', 'explain', 'have', 'done', 'Bar', 'Method', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'workouts', 'have', 'similarites', 'ab', 'portion', 'tape', 'have', 'hold', 'back', 'really', 'up', 'floor', 'hollow', 'belly', 'other', 'tapes', 'really', 'stress', 'keep', 'ribs', 'up', 'floor', 'difference', 'integrity', 'pose', 'Rodney', 'not', 'really', 'stress', 'point', 'one', 'even', 'are', 'working', 'abs', 'very', 'relaxing', 'great', 'one', 'do', 'really', 'brisk', 'walk']",ABS Yoga for Beginners VHS

It may be a little strenuous in the beginning but its no where NEAR doing say 500 crunches with a drill sergeant instructor screaming ""500 more maggot"". A little practice, and you'll be all set.

Although it doesn't involve many traditional yoga poses, the exercises flow together in a way that is unique to yoga.  When I first tried this tape, I wasn't quite sure when the warm-up ended and the ""real"" workout began--the transition was that smooth and gentle.The workout begins in a seated position and focuses on breathing, then moves on to hands and knees for a back stretch (Cat pose).  The majority of the workout is performed lying on your back, where you will do simple yet challenging leg extensions and twists to challenge the abdominal area.  After a quick rise to a standing position, the workout returns to the floor to end with lying relaxation poses.The moves become gradually more difficult, but I think that most beginners will be able to perform the majority of this workout.  I believe that this workout has helped me to developed stronger abs (though I haven't seen the miracle-like results that other reviewers have mentioned).  Rodney Yee is a wonderful instructor--he has a calming voice, his instructions are clear and precise, and he is not overly ""new age-y.""

Beginners shouldn't have any problems with this flowing sequence of poses and as usual Rodney's voice instruction is flawless. I think what I liked the most about ABS YOGA is that this is an Abdominal workout without crunches and I appreciated learning some different moves to help combat the muffin top.Filmed in Death Valley National Park, the backdrop here is a beautiful desert setting. And although I recognized the ambient music from several other Yee DVD's, its pleasant enough and doesn't distract.Beginning in a seated position the first part of this workout concentrates on breathing exercises then moves onto your hands and knees for Cat Pose and finally to your back where most of the workout is performed. With repetitions of knees to chest, head to knees and slowly lowering and raising your legs, you begin to feel the burn. Then Rodney leads us through side twists and several Half and Full Boat Poses which get progressively more difficult as does the burn. Towards the end we stand for Mountain Pose and Foreword Bend before sitting again into Staff and Cobblers Pose. The relaxation segment is short but well done and you'll come away feeling tighter and relaxed.I believe this might be a good introduction to yoga for first timers, giving you a taste of the breathing and energy without overwhelming you with too many traditional yoga poses. And for those who do a regular yoga practice this is a great workout that you will definitely feel in your abs the next day.

From the start I took to them like a duck to water and caught on very fast. I did these for about a year and them moved and got away from Yoga for a couple of years due to job, personal, not enough time, etc. Now I am a Yoga re-beginner, I started with the Rodney Yee Yoga for AM and PM. *What has helped me most is I bought 2 books on all of the Yoga poses with instructions (the best one is the Rodney Yee Book of Yoga, it is the most detailed and has more instructions and pictures). Then I read these BEFORE I began this ABS Yoga or AM/PM Rodney Yee DVD's. By reading the books and re-learning the Yoga poses, I was familiar with them BEFORE I started this DVD and the AM/PM for Beginners by Rodney Yee DVD. However, I have found that this is THE VERY BEST BEGINNER YOGA DVD for any beginner as it is easy to follow, yet you feel the stretch. After several sessions, I already feel the difference in how I look and feel. This DVD REALLY WORKS! This DVD works from a gentle stretch warm-up to the work out of Yoga for ABS and the ""cool-down"" relaxation is at the end--a perfect 20 minute session! Because it is just 20 minutes total, it fits right into my day in the early morning to get me going and full of energy for my day! Here is why the Yoga is such a big help to me and I believe it will be a big help to you:1) It limbers the body.2) It stretches the muscles and firms the muscles.3) After doing the Yoga, I find that I have SUPER energy and in a wonderful mood ALL DAY LONG!4) It is the best medicine for my body, mind and spirit that I have ever found!One day last week, I missed doing my Yoga in the AM and was sluggish all day. Will not miss another Yoga session. Now, I do the Yoga every day and with just 20 minutes, it is so so so do-able!*Each evening I do the Rodney Yee ""Yoga and Meditation"" DVD, this relaxes me and I find that I am much more relaxed and sleep better. Sometimes, I do the ""PM Yoga for Beginners"" with Patricia Waldren (This is on the AM PM Yoga for Beginners). This one is also excellent for unwinding and relaxing for the day.If you are in need of working on your ABS and want to have some Yoga practice at the same time, this is the DVD to buy! I give it 10 stars!After this one, I am so impressed, I ordered 2 more Rodney Yee Yoga CD's from Amazon so I will have some variety. I have 4 total of Rodney Yee's DVDs.

I am always looking for a good ab workout but was not looking for an &quot;Oprah-remember-my-spirit&quot; type program (though ironically I became aware of Rodney Yee's tape on the &quot;Queen Midas'&quot; daytime talk show). Much to my surprise, this is quite a good and quick workout.  Having done the tape several times a week, I already feel and see improvements in that pesky region of the body.  What I found different (and liked!) about this workout was that I did not have to do seemingly endless and boring repititions of crunches or  feel the proverbial &quot;burn.&quot;  But no need to worry, if you are anything like me, your ab muscles will definitely tell you that they are being worked out.  I feel a good muscle tension afterwards (and okay sometimes even some mild soreness the next day).A word of caution for other yoga &quot;newbies.&quot;  It will take some time to get up to speed moving between and doing the series of  poses.  After a dozen times or so, I think I have got it down -- but admittedly still have a mental block with keeping up with Yee's breathing inhalation/exhalation instructions.  As others have noted, skip the annoying ads in the beginning of the tape.  I simply have queued the tape to the start of the workout and rewind it back to that point each time.I will probably not be a &quot;spiritual&quot; yoga convert (my abs don't feel like the &quot;deep soft belly of the dunes&quot; that Yee soothingly tells me each time) but so far I am a fan of this challenging, yet relaxing, program.

It serves as an excellent counterbalance to the typical crunch-type abs workout, plus has all the added benefits of yoga.  The  workout part of the tape is a little under 25 minutes, and part of the tape  is basically ab-focused meditation (but it's not flaky for those who are a  little intimidated by yoga's spiritual side).  The rest is gentle, yet  tough abs work which will be unlike anything you've ever done before.  The  best part is, it works.

It offers RELAXATION.OK, you're probably skeptical about a hard ab workout that can be relaxing as well.  But, this tape does not disappoint.  Rodney Yee is a great instructor, and the clear, soothing voice-overs make this very easy to follow.  The basic exercises focus on isometric exercise (tensing your abdominal muscles and holding them in a stationary position while maintaining the tension) rather the conventional isotonic abdominal exercises (i.e., crunches).Some of them are rather difficult, and, if you have back problems, I recommend bending your knees for the numerous leg-lowering exercises you need to do while on your back.  These exercises also focus on a lot of balance, something that traditional abdominal exercises don't address very often.If you are a beginner, you are definitely in for a soothing, quick but challenging abdominal workout.  If you are an experienced exerciser, this will be a nice add-on to your routine that may actually get your abs doing a double take.  :)",4,Challenge those abs....and relax,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,1155,"['Speaking', 'person', 'who', 'done', 'yoga', 'abs', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'shape', 'think', 'tape', 'something', '8', 'billion', 'crunches', 'ca', ""n't"", 'RELAXATION.OK', ""'re"", 'probably', 'skeptical', 'hard', 'ab', 'can', 'be', 'relaxing', 'as', 'well', 'tape', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'great', 'instructor', 'clear', 'soothing', 'voice-overs', 'make', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'basic', 'focus', 'isometric', 'exercise', 'tensing', 'abdominal', 'muscles', 'holding', 'stationary', 'position', 'maintaining', 'tension', 'rather', 'conventional', 'isotonic', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'i.e.', 'crunches', '.Some', 'are', 'rather', 'difficult', 'have', 'back', 'problems', 'recommend', 'bending', 'knees', 'numerous', 'leg-lowering', 'exercises', 'need', 'do', 'back', 'exercises', 'also', 'focus', 'lot', 'balance', 'something', 'traditional', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'do', ""n't"", 'address', 'very', 'are', 'beginner', 'are', 'definitely', 'soothing', 'quick', 'challenging', 'abdominal', 'workout', 'are', 'experienced', 'exerciser', 'will', 'be', 'nice', 'add-on', 'routine', 'may', 'actually', 'get', 'abs', 'doing', 'double', 'take']",ABS Yoga for Beginners VHS

You can FEEL THE BURN after this workout. Rodney does a great job at explaining the poses/moves.  The movements are fluid, backgrond music is relaxing, pace is right on cue.  This is by far my favorite Ab workout and definitely a great workout for all fitness levels, beginners, intermediate and advanced alike.  In the beginning I could not do some of the more challenging poses but after a couple of practices (1-2 times a week) for about 3-4 weeks, my core gradually became stronger and eventually I was able to master all the moves/poses for a challenging and effective ab workout. Practice does make perfect.  If you are consistent with your practice and take the time to do this right you will not be disappointed. This workout not only tones the Abs but also has the added benefits of yoga relaxation.  After each workout you will also feel relaxed/refreshed and not stressed as you do with ""regular crunches."" This workout is easy enough for a beginner to follow and practice while building strength/endurance, yet challenging enough for intermediate to advanced workout. For beginners practice once or twice a week and modify advanced poses as they build strength.  More advanced users can increase the number of days per week or hold the poses longer for greater challenge.  Either way you'll feel the burn.
