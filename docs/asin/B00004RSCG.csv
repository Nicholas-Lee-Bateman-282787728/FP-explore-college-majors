549235,AYUO4QC08QQ4C,B00004RSCG,"A. M. Steiner ""Huskarl1066""","[0, 0]","Technically speaking, the two faults I find are in the opening scene.  After Oberleutnant Franz von Werra crashes his Bf109E (Emil), the canopy opens up hinged on the port side, rather than starboard, which is correct.  He then pulls out a Walther HP/P.38 before surrendering.  The Walther 9mm Parabellum HP and P.38 were in very limited production before 1941, and would not be carried by the Jagdflieger.  Air crew, on bombers like Heinkel 111, had room on board for Lugers and the Stahlhelm, but not one who had to squeeze into the tight office (cockpit) of the 109.  A 7.65mm would have been more like it, if carried at all, during the Battle of Britain.  Now the Russian Front was another matter.  The movie is well done, as a rule, but Germans do not speak English amongst themselves, and when they do speak German in the film, subtitles for non-German speakers would have been useful.  Having read the book of the same title, I was pleased with the movie, and Hardy Krueger was his usual competent self.  I think it would have been a nice touch to show von Werra with a Pilot's Badge (Fliegerabzeichen)and the EK II (Iron Cross 2nd class), and mention the fact he was awarded the Knight's Cross upon his return to Germany.  The fact how he died was not explained, which was in the same manner as Hans-Joachim Marseille.  The engine caught fire in flight, smoke filled the cockpit, and von Werra and his new Bf109G (Gustav) took a plunge into the North Sea.",5,Nicely done!,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,1463,"['Technically', 'speaking', 'two', 'faults', 'find', 'are', 'opening', 'scene', 'Oberleutnant', 'Franz', 'von', 'Werra', 'Bf109E', 'Emil', 'canopy', 'up', 'hinged', 'port', 'side', 'rather', 'starboard', 'correct', 'then', 'out', 'Walther', 'HP/P.38', 'surrendering', 'Walther', '9mm', 'Parabellum', 'HP', 'P.38', 'were', 'very', 'limited', 'production', '1941', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'carried', 'Jagdflieger', 'Air', 'crew', 'bombers', 'Heinkel', '111', 'had', 'room', 'board', 'Lugers', 'Stahlhelm', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'squeeze', 'tight', 'office', 'cockpit', '109', '7.65mm', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'carried', 'Battle', 'Britain', 'Now', 'Russian', 'Front', 'was', 'matter', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'rule', 'Germans', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'English', 'amongst', 'when', 'do', 'speak', 'German', 'film', 'subtitles', 'non-German', 'speakers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'useful', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'was', 'pleased', 'movie', 'Hardy', 'Krueger', 'was', 'usual', 'competent', 'self', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'touch', 'show', 'von', 'Werra', 'Pilot', 'Badge', 'Fliegerabzeichen', 'EK', 'II', 'Iron', 'Cross', '2nd', 'class', 'mention', 'fact', 'was', 'awarded', 'Knight', 'Cross', 'return', 'Germany', 'fact', 'how', 'died', 'was', 'not', 'explained', 'was', 'same', 'manner', 'Hans-Joachim', 'Marseille', 'engine', 'caught', 'fire', 'flight', 'smoke', 'filled', 'cockpit', 'von', 'Werra', 'new', 'Bf109G', 'Gustav', 'took', 'plunge', 'North', 'Sea']",The One That Got Away [VHS]

549240,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00004RSCG,C. O. DeRiemer,"[36, 38]","This is one of the better WWII movies about an escape from a prisoner-of-war camp. The story is taut and suspenseful. The odds against success are high but we wind up rooting for the man anyway. The guy is handsome, competent, resourceful and self-confident to the point of smugness. No, the guy isn't played by Steve McQueen. There is no ball-bouncing in a prison cell. The man is Oberleutnant Franz von Werra, played by the German actor Hardy Kruger. Von Werra's Messerschmitt is shot down over England on September 5, 1940. He is captured, interrogated and sent to a prisoner of war camp for officers. He turned out to be the only German captured on British soil who ever escaped and made it back to Germany. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed.Von Werra turns out to be a committed German officer, determined to escape, and with enough drive, ingenuity and luck to escape from British camps three times. The first time sees him staggering for five days through mud and freezing rain to try to reach a British port and a neutral ship. When he's finally recaptured he's half dead. The British send him to a much tougher camp in the north. This time he organizes a tunnel dig, figures out how to make fake identity discs and how to convert rag-tag clothing into something passably civilian. On this break von Werra manages to talk himself onto a RAF base posing as a Dutch pilot. He's captured while seated in the cockpit of a Hurricane trying to get it started. He planned to fly back to Germany. Now the British ship him off to a prisoner-of-war camp in Canada. They figure that'll take the starch out of his determination to return to Germany. They didn't figure that von Werra would realize the significance of the United States being a neutral country and how close the train taking him to the camp would be to the Saint Lawrence River border. Sure enough, in the dead cold of a Canadian winter (January, 1941), he escapes from the train, works his way through the snow and freezing drizzle to the mostly frozen river. He finds a boat and finally is picked up on the American side. Our movie ends here, with a big smile on von Werra's frozen face and mumbled ""thank yous"" to the American border guard who found him.Through all of this the escapes are carefully shown with a lot of dramatic tension. You can't help but wind up hoping von Werra's persistence will pay off. Knowing he's an enthusiastic German pilot, a fighter ace, who is eager to get back to the battles takes a little of the edge off, but still...The One That Got Away is filmed in black and white. There are no sweeping, beautiful shots of the countryside. We're talking late fall and winter in Britain and Canada. It's cold and grey. If it's not snowing, it's raining. If it's not raining, it's drizzling. If it's not drizzling it's still so cold you'll want a fire going during the day. The acting is as cool and competent as the movie.And what about von Werra after he made it to America? The Canadians tried to get him back. The Americans wanted to send him back. While everyone was arguing his status, von Werra slipped across the U. S. border into Mexico, then made his way back to Germany by way of Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Spain. He arrived in Berlin on April 18, 1941. He was assigned to fly on the Eastern front, became an ace again, then was sent with his unit to the Netherlands for rest and refitting. On October 21, 1941, his plane malfunctioned during a training flight and went down in the sea. His body was never recovered. Franz von Werra's luck had finally run out.The Region 2 DVD, available from AmazonUK, has no extras but the film transfer looks good.",4,A fine WWII prisoner-of-war escape film...even if we're rooting for the German this time,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,3664,"['one', 'better', 'WWII', 'movies', 'escape', 'prisoner-of-war', 'camp', 'story', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'odds', 'success', 'are', 'high', 'wind', 'up', 'rooting', 'man', 'anyway', 'guy', 'handsome', 'competent', 'resourceful', 'self-confident', 'point', 'smugness', 'No', 'guy', ""n't"", 'played', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'ball-bouncing', 'prison', 'cell', 'man', 'Oberleutnant', 'Franz', 'von', 'Werra', 'played', 'German', 'actor', 'Hardy', 'Kruger', 'Von', 'Werra', 'Messerschmitt', 'shot', 'down', 'England', 'September', '5', '1940', 'captured', 'interrogated', 'sent', 'prisoner', 'war', 'camp', 'officers', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'German', 'captured', 'British', 'soil', 'who', 'ever', 'escaped', 'made', 'back', 'Germany', 'Please', 'note', 'elements', 'plot', 'are', 'discussed.Von', 'Werra', 'out', 'be', 'committed', 'German', 'officer', 'determined', 'escape', 'enough', 'drive', 'ingenuity', 'luck', 'escape', 'British', 'camps', 'three', 'times', 'first', 'time', 'staggering', 'five', 'days', 'mud', 'freezing', 'rain', 'try', 'reach', 'British', 'port', 'neutral', 'ship', 'When', 'finally', 'recaptured', 'half', 'dead', 'British', 'send', 'much', 'tougher', 'camp', 'north', 'time', 'tunnel', 'dig', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'fake', 'identity', 'discs', 'how', 'convert', 'rag-tag', 'clothing', 'something', 'passably', 'civilian', 'break', 'von', 'Werra', 'talk', 'RAF', 'base', 'posing', 'Dutch', 'pilot', 'captured', 'seated', 'cockpit', 'Hurricane', 'trying', 'get', 'started', 'planned', 'fly', 'back', 'Germany', 'Now', 'British', 'ship', 'off', 'prisoner-of-war', 'camp', 'Canada', 'figure', ""'ll"", 'take', 'starch', 'determination', 'return', 'Germany', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'von', 'Werra', 'would', 'realize', 'significance', 'United', 'States', 'being', 'neutral', 'country', 'how', 'close', 'train', 'taking', 'camp', 'would', 'be', 'Saint', 'Lawrence', 'River', 'border', 'Sure', 'enough', 'dead', 'cold', 'Canadian', 'winter', 'January', '1941', 'train', 'way', 'snow', 'freezing', 'drizzle', 'mostly', 'frozen', 'river', 'boat', 'finally', 'picked', 'up', 'American', 'side', 'movie', 'here', 'big', 'smile', 'von', 'Werra', 'frozen', 'face', 'mumbled', 'thank', 'yous', 'American', 'border', 'guard', 'who', 'found', 'escapes', 'are', 'carefully', 'shown', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wind', 'up', 'hoping', 'Werra', 'persistence', 'will', 'pay', 'off', 'Knowing', 'enthusiastic', 'German', 'pilot', 'fighter', 'ace', 'who', 'eager', 'get', 'back', 'battles', 'little', 'edge', 'still', 'One', 'Got', 'Away', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'are', 'sweeping', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'countryside', ""'re"", 'talking', 'late', 'fall', 'winter', 'Britain', 'Canada', 'cold', 'grey', 'not', 'snowing', 'raining', 'not', 'raining', 'drizzling', 'not', 'drizzling', 'still', 'so', 'cold', ""'ll"", 'want', 'fire', 'going', 'day', 'acting', 'cool', 'competent', 'movie.And', 'what', 'von', 'Werra', 'made', 'America', 'Canadians', 'tried', 'get', 'back', 'Americans', 'wanted', 'send', 'back', 'everyone', 'was', 'arguing', 'status', 'von', 'Werra', 'slipped', 'U.', 'S.', 'border', 'Mexico', 'then', 'made', 'way', 'back', 'Germany', 'way', 'Peru', 'Bolivia', 'Brazil', 'Spain', 'arrived', 'Berlin', 'April', '18', '1941', 'was', 'assigned', 'fly', 'Eastern', 'front', 'became', 'ace', 'again', 'then', 'was', 'sent', 'unit', 'Netherlands', 'rest', 'refitting', 'October', '21', '1941', 'plane', 'malfunctioned', 'training', 'flight', 'went', 'down', 'sea', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'recovered', 'Franz', 'von', 'Werra', 'luck', 'had', 'finally', 'run', 'out.The', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'available', 'AmazonUK', 'extras', 'film', 'transfer', 'good']",The One That Got Away [VHS]

Von Werra is played with a muted but still smug swagger by Hardy Kruger,a favorite of mine since SUNDAYS AND CYBELE (LES DIMANCHES DE VILLES D'AVRAY) which won the Oscar for Best Foreign film in 1962. The pilot's sole goal is to be assigned to a POW camp so he can go about the business of escaping, the Brits however, are more concerned with trying to pry information out of him--even going so far as to suggest that his well-known heroics might be all so much fakery and they will expose his deceit to the other German prisoners. No go, he ain't buying it even though what they say may very well be true. He simply doesn't care.Finally they give up and he's sent to a camp from which he quickly attempts an escape but is just as quickly captured and shipped off to another camp. At the second camp the escape is more organized a la THE GREAT ESCAPE but with much the same results for von Werra. And so it goes until he is shipped off to Canada with other escape prone Germans, where he makes his final bid for freedom. The fact that this film was made so soon after the end of WWII is surprising and the fact that Kruger can still makes us feel so much empathy for his character and genuinely make us hope for him to succeed is a testament to both Kruger's abilities as an actor and to the writers and to director Roy Ward Baker.

(Unfortunately, we learn this in the opening credits, so a lot of suspense is spoiled right off.)As Werra, Hardy Kruger is handsome, charismatic, and a good actor.  His experiences make being a POW look like going to scout camp but with better food and less supervision. It seems odd that Britain would make a movie with a German hero and fairly incompetent Brit guards so soon after WWII, but he is quite endearing and I was rooting for him.It is a thrilling and enjoyable story and inspired me to read about the real Von Werra.

549251,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00004RSCG,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY belongs to the rather small genre of films that show the Second World War from the German perspective.  Unlike films like DAS BOOT and THE DESERT FOX, which tended to present the war from the collective focus of a combat arm of the German Army, THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY is presented solely from the vantage of one man, Oberleutnant Franz Von Werra of the Luftwaffe, who, in 1940 was shot down over England and was taken prisoner.  The plot is rather straightforward.  Von Werra refuses to remain in a POW camp and spends the bulk of the film in attempting to escape.  Eventually he does as he returns to Germany and is hailed as a hero by Hitler, is promoted to Kapitan, and is awarded the Iron Cross.What marks the film as remarkably entertaining is a combination of efforts ranging from the bravura performance of Hardy Kruger as Von Werra to the sure directing of Roy Ward Baker and finally to the gritty and clammy weather that figured so prominently in the plot that the snow, ice, and sleet virtually insinuated themselves as a subtext against which Von Werra battled incessantly.  First, with Kruger's interpretation of Von Werra--it was difficult not to sympathize with him, then later to root for him.  Kruger spoke excellect if accented English, was boyishly handsome, was possessed of an incredible sense of self that would not admit of failure, and ultimately had that ever so rare sense of timing that inevitably led to success.  Regardless of his situation, he could immediately size up who was present and using nothing more than bluster and instinct could manipulate both man and machine for his own ends.  Kruger fails in his first two attempts, and at each recapture, you can practically hear the ""twang"" in his head as he mentally reviews his failure and plots his next escape. He even can boast to his English jailer that he will bet cognac against cigarettes that he will succeed in less than six months.It is not only Kruger as Von Werra that marks this film as extraordinary. The English who capture him and hold him prisoner are a thoroughly unimaginative lot, totally devoid of a sense of humor that makes Von Werra by contrast seem a shining presence.  His pursuers are a dogged group of soldiers who succeed in capturing him only because of some bad luck on Von Werra's part. Further, though Von Werra is a Luftwaffe ace, he is no Nazi.  In fact, his relation to the Nazi party is downplayed as is his relation to the general war effort.  The focus of the film is exclusively on one man versus the System.  The fact that the System is the British POW camp leadership is beside the point. Not many films would dare attempt to make a German the hero when to do so is to threaten to throw its balance off center.  That the audience can momentarily not be concerned with being off balance is a tribute to a film that is a true classic of the escape genre.",5,An Unexpected Perspective,1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,2897,"['ONE', 'THAT', 'GOT', 'AWAY', 'belongs', 'rather', 'small', 'genre', 'films', 'show', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'German', 'perspective', 'films', 'DAS', 'BOOT', 'THE', 'DESERT', 'FOX', 'tended', 'present', 'war', 'collective', 'focus', 'combat', 'arm', 'German', 'Army', 'THE', 'ONE', 'THAT', 'GOT', 'AWAY', 'presented', 'solely', 'vantage', 'one', 'man', 'Oberleutnant', 'Franz', 'Von', 'Werra', 'Luftwaffe', 'who', '1940', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'England', 'was', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'plot', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'Von', 'Werra', 'remain', 'POW', 'camp', 'bulk', 'film', 'attempting', 'escape', 'Eventually', 'Germany', 'hailed', 'hero', 'Hitler', 'promoted', 'Kapitan', 'awarded', 'Iron', 'Cross.What', 'film', 'remarkably', 'entertaining', 'combination', 'efforts', 'ranging', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Hardy', 'Kruger', 'Von', 'Werra', 'sure', 'directing', 'Roy', 'Ward', 'Baker', 'finally', 'gritty', 'clammy', 'weather', 'figured', 'so', 'prominently', 'plot', 'snow', 'ice', 'sleet', 'virtually', 'insinuated', 'subtext', 'Von', 'Werra', 'battled', 'incessantly', 'First', 'Kruger', 'interpretation', 'Von', 'Werra', 'was', 'difficult', 'not', 'sympathize', 'then', 'later', 'root', 'Kruger', 'spoke', 'excellect', 'accented', 'English', 'was', 'boyishly', 'handsome', 'was', 'possessed', 'incredible', 'sense', 'self', 'would', 'not', 'admit', 'failure', 'ultimately', 'had', 'ever', 'so', 'rare', 'sense', 'timing', 'inevitably', 'led', 'success', 'Regardless', 'situation', 'could', 'immediately', 'size', 'up', 'who', 'was', 'present', 'using', 'nothing', 'more', 'bluster', 'instinct', 'could', 'manipulate', 'man', 'machine', 'own', 'ends', 'Kruger', 'first', 'two', 'attempts', 'recapture', 'can', 'practically', 'hear', 'twang', 'head', 'mentally', 'failure', 'plots', 'next', 'escape', 'even', 'can', 'boast', 'English', 'jailer', 'will', 'bet', 'cognac', 'cigarettes', 'will', 'succeed', 'less', 'six', 'months.It', 'not', 'only', 'Kruger', 'Von', 'Werra', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'English', 'who', 'capture', 'hold', 'prisoner', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'unimaginative', 'lot', 'totally', 'devoid', 'sense', 'humor', 'Von', 'Werra', 'contrast', 'seem', 'shining', 'presence', 'pursuers', 'are', 'dogged', 'group', 'soldiers', 'who', 'succeed', 'capturing', 'only', 'bad', 'luck', 'Von', 'Werra', 'part', 'Further', 'Von', 'Werra', 'Luftwaffe', 'ace', 'Nazi', 'fact', 'relation', 'Nazi', 'party', 'downplayed', 'relation', 'general', 'war', 'effort', 'focus', 'film', 'exclusively', 'one', 'man', 'System', 'fact', 'System', 'British', 'POW', 'camp', 'leadership', 'point', 'Not', 'many', 'films', 'would', 'dare', 'attempt', 'make', 'German', 'hero', 'when', 'do', 'so', 'threaten', 'throw', 'balance', 'center', 'audience', 'can', 'momentarily', 'not', 'be', 'concerned', 'being', 'off', 'balance', 'tribute', 'film', 'true', 'classic', 'escape', 'genre']",The One That Got Away [VHS]

Remember him from ""The Flight of the Phoenix,"" with Jimmy Stewart?  Unlike his character in that movie, he plays a much more flamboyant figure in ""The One That Got Away.""In an age where Hollywood glorifies Americans as being the only independent & courageous people on the planet, it is nice to see a little redress.  Except for ""Letters From Iwo Jima,"" I can't think of another movie that reminds us there are always men on the other side who fight & die for their country.That brings us to the crux of the matter: Hollywood.  Neither ""The Boat,"" originally released as ""Das Boot,"" or ""The One That Got Away"" was produced in America.  If you want a fresh perspective on events - past and present - try looking at foreign made films.Another reason to recommend this movie: There are no politics involved; simply the drama of one man's ordeal.  Considering it was made in 1957 that is something!The B&W; in which it is shot also adds a sense of life & death drama - which it is.
