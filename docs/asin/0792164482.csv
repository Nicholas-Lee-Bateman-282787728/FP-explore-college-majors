Rutten,"[15, 18]","For those people who disliked this film so vehemently, I suggest you read a plot summary/review of the next film you rent/buy so you have some idea of what you will be watching!  How could you NOT know that this was a  romantic comedy with a &quot;predictible&quot; ending before you watched  it?  And if you didn't like either Roberts or Gere, why did you rent it in  the first place?  Unlike most romantic comedies that start brightly and  fade quickly, &quot;Bride&quot; delivers from beginning to end.  Well-edited, it is light-hearted, sweet and oh-so-funny!  The comment made  by Hector Elanzo about the Fed-Ex truck gave me the healthiest belly-laugh  I've had in ages!  And there are more like that!  Humor is personal, but  this is just darn cute!  The chemistry between Roberts and Gere is real!  They are beautiful together, AND as has been mentioned before, without  swearing up a storm and rolling naked in the sheets!  And you STILL know  they love each other!  That's romance!  We need more of that!  As for the  predictability, we go to the movies to have our emotions manipulated and to  be entertained!  If you're going for another reason, save your money!  The  supporting cast is excellent - Rita Wilson, Hector Elanzo, Joan Cusak and a  host of other small but necessary bits of brightness in an already starry  look at the bittersweet but inevitable search for love !  As one of Julia's  fiancees says, &quot;There's a lid for every pot!&quot; Watching this  optimistic rollercoaster ride gives hope to all of us who believe that it  CAN happen!  And even if it doesn't, you'll have a smile on your face for 2  hours.  AND there is actually some substance to this story - real messages  about how men and women should feel about themselves BEFORE they can say  they really love someone else!  The ending?  Anyone who would want it any  other way needs to have his or her head examined! Oh, one more thing - you  can even watch this movie with children in the room!  They won't  understand everything!  But there is absolutely nothing offensive!

130896,A3MFGOKZO3CH63,0792164482,Andrea Gidusko,"[3, 4]","I've been in love with Pretty Woman since the first time I saw it, at fifteen. I have been dreaming of a sequel forever, but eventually gave up hope. Then in 1998 I hear that they're filming a new movie with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, directed by the great (he told me I was pretty:) Garry Marshall and immediately got excited. Sure I had to wait until July 30th to see the film, but I followed as much as I could before then. I had heard that there were a few scenes that related to Pretty Woman and they were easy to find; the throwing of the snail/the throwing of the crab mallet, the money negotiations and the problems buying a dress, but being the obsessed fan that I am I saw many more similarities such as silver cars in both films and the fact that Julia's character knows more about cars then Richard's. Like I said, obsessed fan:)I even bought a DVD player just for this film and the 10th anniversary special edition of Pretty Woman which was released a couple months later. Sure I now own many DVDs, but those two are the ones I watch the most. At least I can't wear out a DVD:)Garry Marshall has stated many times that he doesn't make films for critics, he makes them for fans, and that is what makes him a hero to me. Runaway Bride was made for the fans of Pretty Woman, and that was proven in how much money was generated and the fact that Pretty Woman sequel buzz started again not long after Runaway Brides success, but it's been two years and I've given up hope. Critics panned Runaway Bride for various reasons I don't really know b/c I don't like critics and I don't read reviews, all I know is I love the film and have found myself watching it four times a day when I have nothing better to do.Runaway Bride reunites MOST of the cast of Pretty Woman, Julia, Richard, Hector Elizondo, even such members as Patrick Richwood who played Dennis the elevator operator in Pretty Woman and had a few minutes with a video camera in Runaway Bride, Julie Paris who played a prostitute in Pretty Woman and a reporter in Runaway Bride, even down to the actor who played a tourist taking pictures of a dead body in Pretty Woman and Richard's hotel neighbor in Runaway Bride. Garry Marshall is known for putting the same people in his movies, the &quot;Crony Count&quot; as it's called, a group that includes his daughter Kathleen and his son Scott. This would be annoying if they couldn't act, but both are incredible in their small yet pivotal roles in Runaway Bride. Unfortunately Kathleen's part in Pretty Woman was that of a hotel desk clerk and her lines were &quot;Yes ma'am may I help you...yes ma'am....no sir.&quot; but her part as Julia's man crazy cousin Cindy in Runaway Bride was very entertaining. One prime example being after Maggie leaves fiance number four, Bob (Chris &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; Meloni) and as he storms out she says &quot;You are going to find someone who can make you so much happier then I ever could!&quot; not a second later Cindy (Kathleen) pushes by saying &quot;Look out!&quot; and immediately goes after Bob giving him her number. Yes, that is a small example and her part is larger then that, but it did get one of the biggest laughs in the theater and that's always a plus.Scott had almost no lines as a drug dealer on a skateboard in Pretty Woman but made me laugh as the hotel clerk in Runaway Bride who after giving Maggie (Julia) the keys to Ike's (Richard) hotel room so she can snoop around yells out &quot;Don't take anything heavy!&quot;The entire supporting cast is wonderful, Joan Cusack as Maggies best friend who can't help but feel jealous of Maggies &quot;Quirkyness&quot;, Jean Schertler as Maggies grandmother, Paul Dooley as Maggies alcoholic father, Rita Wilson as one of Ike's ex-coworkers, Jean Schertler Ike's ex wife, even Julia's sister Lisa has a memorable role in the film; the list goes on and on. Sure I would have been even happier if more actors from Pretty Woman showed up in Runaway Bride, such as Laura San Giacomo who was probably busy on Just Shoot Me at the time, and Jason Alexander who said in an interview that everyone hated him in Pretty Woman so there was a good reason he wasn't in Runaway Bride, but I'm happy with what I got.Another thing that makes this movie great is chemistry, one of the many things that made Pretty Woman the fairytale classic it is. You see Richard and Julia and you WANT them to be together, and when they finally do get together you feel fulfilled. If I romance doesn't do that for you then there's really no point at all. I guess my point is, if you loved Pretty Woman you will love Runaway Bride. Yes, it is much more lighthearted then Pretty Woman, and some may find it corny, but sometimes corny works and in my opinion this movie works in so many ways. It's pretty much has the same story line as Pretty Woman, two lost people finding each other and finding out more about themselves along the way.Sure we'll probably never get a sequel to Pretty Woman, but in this case we get to see Richard Gere and Julia Roberts together again and in this case we actually get to see them get married, which I guess is supposed to take the place of a sequel, but it doesn't mean I'll ever stop wishing and hoping, planing and dreaming...wait...wrong Julia movie:)And P.S, I'm watching it right now:)",5,"I still want a sequal, but this will do for

This movie is nice and sweet and decently enjoyable, but it just doesn't have that same magic or chemistry that the two stars had in their earlier smash. Nice, stylish direction points go to Garry Marshall however. Gere plays a journalist who is starting to feel like he isn't a good writer anymore. Then, he gets wind of this woman whose left a number of grooms at the altar. He's sent to this idealistic 'Mayberry' looking town, to track her down and get the scoop. The woman, of course, played by Ms. Roberts. We learn that she is engaged again to a man(played by Oz's Christopher Meloni). While investigating this odd woman, Gere's character begins to....you guessed it, fall for her. Julia, like wise. The supporting players are better than our two stars.

The premise of the film (a USA Today writer writes a slanderous,  unresearched piece about a woman who has fled the altar 3 times, gets  fired, and tries to redeem himself by proving the woman is as bad as he  said she was) is far-fetched, even by the team that made Julia Roberts a  24-year old hooker with a heart of gold, in Pretty Woman.Part of the  problem is the miscasting of Richard Gere. His quiet underplaying was  well-suited for the aloof businessman who learns to loosen up, in Pretty  Woman. Here, however, he is supposed to be a free-wheeling, glib, 'Cary  Grant'-type, and it's out of his range. He seems uncomfortable through much  of the film. On the other hand, Julia Roberts gives her standard 'I'm so  cute, but vulnerable' interpretation to the heroine (She is becoming as  stereotyped in that role as Meg Ryan has become!) The role is poorly  written until her father (well-played by the reliable Tom Dooley) reveals  the weakness that created her indecision at the altar.Once this  revelation is revealed, the film SHOULD move along to a happy ending, but  Gary Marshall throws in a contrived monkeywrench (in a CAMERA FLASH, of all  things!), primarily to give Roberts a chance to show off how self-reliant  she can become, and move the film from the pastoral Maryland settings to  the big city ('Small Town Girl Makes Good!')Pretty Woman had so much  charm and chutzpah that you were rooting for Gere and Roberts to live  'happily ever after'.

Don't overlook the cast of supporting actors that even give the two-dimensional characters a third dimension. Remember Rita Wilson form ""Sleepless in Seattle""(1993)?

Both Gere and Roberts have improved as actors since PW in  1990, but the story here didn't give them much help.Ike Graham (Gere)  loses his job as a columnist over an unsubstantiated story he writes about  Maggie Carpenter's (Roberts) habit of leaving her prospective husbands at  the alter in full flight. He then takes a trip to her small town to see if  he can get the real story and vindicate himself. The story is ok to here,  but thereafter it is contrived and implausible.The minute he arrives,  everyone is just delighted to tell him Maggie's most intimate secrets.  That's just not the way small town folks act with complete strangers,  especially big city reporters who just made a mockery of one of their own.  Since this universal acceptance and intimating is the key to everything  that comes afterward, it makes the whole story a little far  fetched.Despite this defect, the characters are well developed, and  flawed though they are, they are lovable. The age old romantic comedy angle  of antagonists falling in love gets a good treatment here. The plot really  produces no major surprises after about midway through the film, but as  this is a romantic comedy, everyone is rooting for it to end the way they  expect anyway.As before, Gere and Roberts have great screen chemistry.  Richard Gere plays a little different character here than he is used to,  less macho; more vulnerable and sensitive. This was a much more mature  performance than the cocky arrogant roles he usually takes on and I think  it marks an expansion of his talent. Julia Roberts is...well...Julia  Roberts. Somehow, the whole of her performance is always greater than the  sum of the parts. She has found a comfortable home in the romantic genre  and as long as she doesn't attempt to stray too far from that domain (eg.  Mary Reilly, Conspiracy Theory), she will always do well.Marshall did  the best that could be done with the script he had and kept the story  moving along well. There was nothing ground breaking from a visual  standpoint, but the actors were well directed and the whole cast meshed  well.I rated this movie a 7.

That said, I still take my hat off to Baldwin, et al, for putting together a first-rate production.Both Alec Baldwin and Julia Roberts, smartly protray lead roles with characters that are both entertaining and complex.  Baldwin plays Ike Graham, a NYC columnist who picks up on a story about a woman named Maggie Carpenter (Roberts) in Maryland, who has fled the scene of her own wedding on 3 different occasions.  Fired because, he didn't verify all of the &quot;facts&quot; in his story, Graham travels to Maryland to meet the woman, now engaged for a 4th time, and vindicate his story and resurrect his career.  He is convinced that Maggie will flee yet another wedding.What ensues is a battle of wits between Ike and Maggie that alternates between engaging and hilarious.  But along the way, both of them find out a lot about each other, and even more about themselves.  While at the start, there isn't much about either Ike or Maggie that is enduring, one can't help but empathize and sympathize with both of them as the film progresses.  There are a lot of very funny moments interspersed throughout, and none of them seem out of place.The ending is what is expected, but takes a different route to get there, and is never dull along the way.The only thing that holds down the film are a few blatant product placements.  The name paper that Ike works for is displayed ad nauseum, as well as a certain delivery service's truck.  That said, it is still a complete package with an engaging story that will keep you interested and laughing, well-developed characters, a good supporting cast, and overall solid acting.

130939,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0792164482,Gregor von Kallahann,"[0, 2]","I went on an ""comedy film binge"" this past weekend, for various and sundry reasons I had been thinking that I needed that kind of escapism.  Anyone questioning my motives for finally checking this movie out (six years after its release) might surmise that recent newstories using the title in their headlines had something to do with it.  Subconsiously, maybe, but I kinda doubt it.  I just grabbed up whatever fairly recent comedy releases were available at the public library.  RUNAWAY BRIDE turned out to be the best of a not-so-hot lot.The stars' much vaunted chemistry is real enough.  Gere and Roberts had apparently been looking for a vehicle that might ""recapture the magic"" of PRETTY WOMAN without slavishly imitating that 1990 hit.  Trouble (for me) was, while I believe that, the point is pretty much lost on me.  While I vaguely remember seeing PRETTY WOMAN on TV at some point, I don't recall much about it at all.  There may have been magic certainly, but for this viewer, I guess you could say it wasn't a longlasting spell.  (Of course, the fact that I saw it on TV may have had something to do with it's being less than memorable.)But they do have a lot going on in this movie.  Some will call it chemistry: it could also be that they're both real pros and know exactly how to pull off the of romantic comedy routine at this point in their long careers.  Same for the rest of the cast.  The support team includes such reliable actors as Paul Dooley, Joan Cusack (and what's a 90s comedy without Joan Cusack?), Rita Wilson, Chris Meloni, Donal Logue, (an inexplicablyly uncredited) Laurie Metcalf and a slew of others.  Director Garry Marshall knows how to assemble a solid caste--and what to do with once he's got them in place.  It's shtick, to a degree, but it's pretty good shtick.And that's why I wound up preferring this one to the other (mostly '90's comedies) I finally got around to watching this past weekend.  While not taking itself overly seriously, RUNAWAY BRIDE touches lightly on numerous themes that resonate in these (post)modern times: love and marriage, of course, gender roles, the importance of self-actualization as well as commitment, etc.  It doesn't wind up saying anything particularly original on any of these scores, but it's does make a few unpretentious statements about the battle of and rapprochement between the sexes in this time of cultural change.And that's what I wound up liking about it--it wore its pretentious lightly and unlike some of the other films I also happened to view (DRWONING MONA and MIXED NUTS were the others)over the past couple of days, was not so hellbent on being a daringly oddball comedy.  Let's face it, Hollywood, not everybody is the Coen Brothers--or the Farrellys.  Outrageousness for outrageousness' sake is overrated and getting kind of old.  Sort of makes you appreciate good, somewhat old-fashioned feel-good comedy after all.",3,Best Movie I Saw  Last Weekend!,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,2913,"['went', 'comedy', 'film', 'binge', 'past', 'weekend', 'various', 'sundry', 'reasons', 'had', 'been', 'thinking', 'needed', 'kind', 'escapism', 'Anyone', 'questioning', 'motives', 'finally', 'checking', 'movie', 'six', 'years', 'release', 'might', 'surmise', 'recent', 'newstories', 'using', 'title', 'headlines', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Subconsiously', 'maybe', 'kinda', 'doubt', 'just', 'grabbed', 'up', 'whatever', 'fairly', 'recent', 'comedy', 'releases', 'were', 'available', 'public', 'library', 'RUNAWAY', 'BRIDE', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'not-so-hot', 'lot.The', 'stars', 'much', 'vaunted', 'chemistry', 'real', 'enough', 'Gere', 'Roberts', 'had', 'apparently', 'been', 'looking', 'vehicle', 'might', 'recapture', 'magic', 'PRETTY', 'WOMAN', 'slavishly', 'imitating', '1990', 'hit', 'Trouble', 'was', 'believe', 'point', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'seeing', 'PRETTY', 'WOMAN', 'TV', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'much', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'magic', 'certainly', 'viewer', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'longlasting', 'spell', 'course', 'fact', 'saw', 'TV', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'being', 'less', 'memorable', 'do', 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'movie', 'will', 'call', 'chemistry', 'could', 'also', 'be', ""'re"", 'real', 'pros', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'pull', 'off', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'routine', 'point', 'long', 'careers', 'Same', 'rest', 'cast', 'support', 'team', 'such', 'reliable', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Dooley', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'what', '90s', 'comedy', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Chris', 'Meloni', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'inexplicablyly', 'uncredited', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'slew', 'others', 'Director', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'how', 'assemble', 'solid', 'caste', 'what', 'do', 'once', 'got', 'place', 'shtick', 'degree', 'pretty', 'good', 'shtick.And', 'why', 'wound', 'up', 'preferring', 'one', 'other', 'mostly', 'comedies', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'past', 'weekend', 'not', 'taking', 'overly', 'seriously', 'RUNAWAY', 'BRIDE', 'lightly', 'numerous', 'themes', 'resonate', 'post', 'modern', 'times', 'love', 'marriage', 'course', 'gender', 'roles', 'importance', 'self-actualization', 'as', 'well', 'commitment', 'etc', ""n't"", 'wind', 'up', 'saying', 'anything', 'particularly', 'original', 'scores', 'make', 'few', 'unpretentious', 'statements', 'battle', 'rapprochement', 'sexes', 'time', 'cultural', 'change.And', 'what', 'wound', 'up', 'liking', 'wore', 'pretentious', 'lightly', 'other', 'films', 'also', 'happened', 'view', 'DRWONING', 'MONA', 'MIXED', 'NUTS', 'were', 'others', 'past', 'couple', 'days', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'hellbent', 'being', 'daringly', 'oddball', 'comedy', 'Let', 'face', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'everybody', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Farrellys', 'Outrageousness', 'outrageousness', 'sake', 'overrated', 'getting', 'kind', 'old', 'Sort', 'appreciate', 'good', 'somewhat', 'old-fashioned', 'feel-good', 'comedy']",N/A

But when he started being nice, he was very likeable, as was Julia Roberts from beginning to end.  One other negative note.  I hate movies that play this garbage that passes for music during every ""significant"" scene.  It is distracting and maddening and very bad music, and it is usually sung by people who make me think of those people who are called artists if they can scream loud enough.

I thought it was complex enough to be interesting, and this due to the various characters.  Lots of the lines were dead-on.  Everyone acted his part to the hilt.  It wasn't particularly funny, but it was fun and warm, and I don't think it was supposed to be funny.

So, when a drunken gentleman in a bar hears his dilemna,  he offers the story of a woman in his hometown who has this tendency to  leave men at the altar, at the last possible moment.  With an extra minute  or two of research, he submits a column degrading this &quot;runaway  bride&quot; as a &quot;maneater&quot; just in time for publication.  Meanwhile, back in little town USA, Hale, MD, the &quot;runaway bride&quot;  (Julia Roberts) reads the column and her complaints of inaccuracy result in  Ike's termination.  With the help of best friend and editor's husband,  Fisher (Hector Elizondo), Ike heads down to Hale, MD to find out the truth.  Hence, the movie &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; continues in such a hysterical  fashion that you are prone to laugh approximately every 30 seconds for the  remainder of this 2 hour movie.  Director Garry Marshall manages to nearly  exceed his stint 10 years ago directing Gere, Roberts and Elizondo in  &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; by developing each character to the hilt, giving  us little quirks of each one to think about continuously.  Gere and Roberts  attain the same level of chemistry as before but, this time, they have help  from Peggy Fleming, owner of the beauty parlor (Joan Cusack, in yet another  role of amazing hilarity), Mrs. Pressman, the owner of the town diner (an  adorable minor role, perfected by Jane Morris), the I-shouldn't-be-single  single cousin Cindy (Kathleen Marshall, with one of the best one-liners in  the movie), and Betty Trout, the owner of the town bakery (an exceedingly  funny Laurie Metcalf, formerly of TV's 'Roseanne').  Of course, to not  mention Maggie's father, the alcoholic Walter (Paul Dooley) and her  sex-obsessed grandma (Jean Schertler) would be a sin.  Overall, Marshall  assembled the best supporting cast of 1999, making for one crazy, funny  movie with an adorable plot, not to mention an incredible soundtrack with  classics by U2, Billy Joel, and Hall and Oates, as well as new songs by  Shawn Colvin, Eric Clapton, Martina McBride, and 2 songs by grammy  goddesses, the Dixie Chicks.

My date thought this movie had so much potential but just didn't deliver.  The previews made the film look so wonderful, so funny and so romantic.  But it turned out to be just another cheesy and cliche-ish flick.  A total bore. Richard Gere plays a tell-it-as-it-is reporter.  He lives a simple and snappy life.  His quick and witty responses to everyone is humorous and reflective of his outgoing nature.  Julia Roberts plays an enigmatic and gorgeous country-girl who gave up a potential big city career to take care of her alcohol loving dad.  Well, she's also The Runaway Bride and instead of asking why, everyone just makes fun of her.  She's not a &quot;ditz&quot; but she takes it with a smile (well, duh! she's still not an air-head cause she's JULIA FREAKING ROBERTS).  Anyhow, the story goes downhill from there.  Sounds silly?  I thought so... The cast is brilliantly cast.  Problem is, only Hector Elizondo and Rita Wilson showed any spark or originality.  The others are just shells of sterotypes.  The movie is directed by Super Director Garry Marshall.  The problem is, we are all so emersed in the credits, what comes on screen is just smothered with potential and never really fills our appetite for a good film. I love Julia Roberts.  I love Richard Gere.  But this movie is just terrible.  Terribly cliche-ish and Boring!  Not an ounce of fun or humor or originality or romance.  Oh, the Romance, didn't mention that in this Romance-comedy.  Well, there is NO spark or chemistry between Roberts-Gere.  They are acting to a void.  In fact, Roberts and Gere acted BETTER individually than in the same screen.  Honestly.  Gere was brilliant in NY and Roberts was acting great in her hick town.

130980,A152C8GYY25HAH,0792164482,Matthew Horner,"[2, 6]","Runaway Bride is a romantic comedy that uses a tried and true formula for success. Put two stars who had a big hit together again. Team them with the same director. Put them in a completely different situation, but essentially clone their characters from the first movie. Add eccentric characters for the subordinate roles. Use lush photography, decorator sets, and a lilting music score. Ttir, but don't shake. It worked for Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, as well as for Doris Day and Rock Hudson. So, by golly, it worked this time for Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Unfortunately, in my view, Runaway Bride is neither a Philadelphia Story nor a Pillow Talk.This movie is the kind that always presents yours truly with a dilemma. I call it an Adorable Puppy movie. It is almost impossible not to be attracted to a cute puppy, even though you know it's going to make a big mess at some point. Sometimes, the lovability of the little dog is so great that the mess is overlooked. Sometimes, but not always. Two-thirds of the way through Runaway Bride, I found myself muttering &quot;Bad doggie! Bad doggie!&quot; Or, maybe I just have a lower than average Cute Quotient.Richard Gere is Ike Graham, a cynical columnist for USA Today, who has very few kind things to say about women. He indirectly meets his match when he writes a column about a Maryland woman who has bolted at the alter so many times, she's been dubbed The Runaway Bride. his subject is Maggie Carpenter [Julia Roberts], who writes a letter to his editor citing over a dozen incorrect facts in the column. The editor, who happens to be Graham's ex-wife, fires him. At the suggestion of a good friend, who happens to be his ex's current spouse, he goes to Maryland to write an article about Maggie for Esquire magazine. This time, he is determined to get his facts straight. He meets Maggie, who is about to try to get married again in a week, and, well, you can write the story from there.It all sounds like a grand time for an audience, so why did the picture fail me? There are several reasons. For one thing, Maggie's home town is too cute to be believed. It's supposed to be idyllic, but it looks and feels like a tourist trap to me, as though it were an attraction at Disney World. I could gag on its quaintness. The humor, which is pletiful in the movie's first half, tapers off as we get to know the couple. Ike and Maggie both suffer from a terrible fear of commitment. Normally, I would be empathetic. Here, we have a guy who is so mean-spirited that old ladies he has never met come up to him on the street and hit him over the head with their hand bags. Maggie is so caught up in her own fear of being herself that she becomes whatever her various grooms want her to be. But why would she wait until she was walking down the aisle to panic and run away - not once, but four times? It never seems to occur to her that, in the process, she is hardly the only victim. In the hands of an ingenious director, all this might have been overlooked. Serious thoughts are not supposed to intrude in our minds when we watch a comedy, are they? Since director Garry Marshall can't keep us focused on the adorable puppy aspects of Runaway Bride, we have too many opportunities to think about its plot's many messes.Despite all these problems, Roberts and Gere come close at times to salvaging the movie. They make an electric team, and like their romantic comedy star forerunners, the fact that they enjoy working together so much tends to rub off. If they decide to make another picture together, I am sure I will forgive them for Runaway Bride and buy a ticket. Me and forty million other people.",2,Stars nealy salvage old-fashioned romantic comedy,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,3668,"['Runaway', 'Bride', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'success', 'Put', 'two', 'stars', 'who', 'had', 'big', 'hit', 'together', 'again', 'Team', 'same', 'director', 'Put', 'completely', 'different', 'situation', 'essentially', 'clone', 'characters', 'first', 'movie', 'Add', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'subordinate', 'roles', 'Use', 'lush', 'photography', 'decorator', 'sets', 'lilting', 'music', 'score', 'Ttir', 'do', ""n't"", 'shake', 'worked', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'as', 'well', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'So', 'golly', 'worked', 'time', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Unfortunately', 'view', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'Pillow', 'Talk.This', 'movie', 'kind', 'always', 'yours', 'truly', 'dilemma', 'call', 'Adorable', 'Puppy', 'movie', 'almost', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'attracted', 'cute', 'puppy', 'even', 'know', 'going', 'make', 'big', 'mess', 'point', 'Sometimes', 'lovability', 'little', 'dog', 'so', 'great', 'mess', 'overlooked', 'Sometimes', 'not', 'always', 'Two-thirds', 'way', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'found', 'muttering', 'quot', 'Bad', 'doggie', 'Bad', 'doggie', 'quot', 'maybe', 'just', 'have', 'lower', 'average', 'Cute', 'Quotient.Richard', 'Gere', 'Ike', 'Graham', 'cynical', 'columnist', 'USA', 'Today', 'who', 'very', 'few', 'kind', 'things', 'say', 'women', 'indirectly', 'match', 'when', 'column', 'Maryland', 'woman', 'who', 'bolted', 'alter', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'been', 'dubbed', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'subject', 'Maggie', 'Carpenter', '[', 'Julia', 'Roberts', ']', 'who', 'letter', 'editor', 'citing', 'over', 'dozen', 'incorrect', 'facts', 'column', 'editor', 'who', 'be', 'Graham', 'ex-wife', 'suggestion', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'be', 'ex', 'current', 'spouse', 'Maryland', 'write', 'article', 'Maggie', 'Esquire', 'magazine', 'time', 'determined', 'get', 'facts', 'straight', 'Maggie', 'who', 'try', 'get', 'married', 'again', 'week', 'well', 'can', 'write', 'story', 'there.It', 'grand', 'time', 'audience', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'picture', 'fail', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'one', 'thing', 'Maggie', 'home', 'town', 'too', 'cute', 'be', 'believed', 'supposed', 'be', 'idyllic', 'feels', 'tourist', 'trap', 'were', 'attraction', 'Disney', 'World', 'could', 'gag', 'quaintness', 'humor', 'pletiful', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'tapers', 'off', 'get', 'know', 'couple', 'Ike', 'Maggie', 'suffer', 'terrible', 'fear', 'commitment', 'Normally', 'would', 'be', 'empathetic', 'Here', 'have', 'guy', 'who', 'so', 'mean-spirited', 'old', 'ladies', 'never', 'met', 'come', 'up', 'street', 'hit', 'head', 'hand', 'bags', 'Maggie', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'fear', 'being', 'various', 'grooms', 'want', 'be', 'why', 'would', 'wait', 'was', 'walking', 'down', 'aisle', 'panic', 'run', 'away', 'not', 'once', 'four', 'times', 'never', 'occur', 'process', 'hardly', 'only', 'victim', 'hands', 'ingenious', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'Serious', 'thoughts', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'intrude', 'minds', 'when', 'watch', 'comedy', 'are', 'director', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'focused', 'adorable', 'puppy', 'aspects', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'opportunities', 'think', 'plot', 'many', 'messes.Despite', 'problems', 'Roberts', 'Gere', 'come', 'close', 'times', 'salvaging', 'movie', 'make', 'electric', 'team', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'star', 'forerunners', 'fact', 'enjoy', 'working', 'together', 'so', 'much', 'tends', 'rub', 'off', 'decide', 'make', 'picture', 'together', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'forgive', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'buy', 'ticket', 'Me', 'forty', 'million', 'other', 'people']",N/A

131004,A281NPSIMI1C2R,0792164482,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[23, 31]","DVD is definitely the way to go on this movie.  You will want to instantly play back all those deliciously romantic scenes where Maggie Carpenter  (played by Julia Roberts) and Ike Graham (played by Richard Gere) melt the  screen with their magical chemistry.  This is a movie for those who want to  find their soul mate, who want to walk on the beach in the rain and who  know that there is one perfect person out there.The only problem is, we  are all human, and like all humans we have some inherent flaw.  For Maggie,  it is running from the altar.  She simply cannot go through with the  wedding and either runs, rides a horse or escapes by some other creative  means.  The variety with which each wedding scene was played out gave the  movie a feel of intense creativity.There was more going on in this  movie than you would ever imagine on the first viewing.  While I recommend  you watch the movie first, the director Gary Marshall's narration and sense  of humor in the commentary version is not to be missed.  You will so enjoy  seeing how the movie was made, what scenes were cut out and why some of the  ideas were carried through the movie, e.g. the ""bell"" theme.  I  literally watched the movie and then watched it again in the commentary  version.On occasion, you do find a great romantic comedy the whole  family can enjoy.  If only more movies were made this way!  Julia's smile  and the superbly creative script gave this movie a good dose of down home  appeal.  You really would not mind living in this town, it is so cute.  The  outdoor scenes are gorgeous and great effort went into making sure  everything looked perfect.  Don't worry about the guys, this movie has  plenty of sports scenes for them and Maggie's fourth husband to be is a  sport fan and coach.While being pulled into imagining how Maggie and Ike  will get together, you start to care about the characters.  The development  of the characters takes great acting, great writing and superb directing.  This movie has all three.  The one part of the movie I did think was  strange was the part where Maggie has kept all the engagement rings.  That  to me would not happen too often in real life, but we women enjoyed seeing  them nonetheless.  To be truthful, women have secret desires which are  revealed in parts of this movie.  Gary Marshall says in his commentary that  part of a relationship is learning from each other and becoming a better  person.  That is what I loved about this movie.  The characters fight for  each other, their friends are there for them through the good and the bad  times and they accept that no one is perfect.The movie starts out with  Maggie literally bolting from her wedding on a horse and then with Ike  Graham trying to finish writing an article for his newspaper column in New  York.  He meets an interesting character who tells him all about a girl  from Hale, Maryland who they call the Runaway Bride.  After reading his  column, Maggie writes a witty, humorous letter and in no time Ike is on the  road to her town to get the real story.  Convinced he will catch her  running from the next wedding, he accidently falls under her spell.  One of  the best lines in the film is when Maggie is not interested in talking to  Ike and simply says: ""I'd love to stay and chat, but I still have my  job.""  This bantering is so amusing and I loved the playful scenes,  which if you watch all the way to the end of the credits, you will see  another one!I thought the music was very appropriate for each scene.  Yes, there was some very familiar music, but that made the movie more fun.  There were also a host of familiar actors which gave the movie a sense of  ""I know these people!""  I loved the slapstick and the quirky  facial expressions of Maggie's best friend.  There are some great  ""girl talk"" moments as friends tell each other honestly how they  feel.Julia Roberts brings a childlike joy to this movie and her smile  is worth the cost of this DVD!  Richard Gere has never looked better!  Then  there are also scenes with a cat which to me shows Ike's sensitive nature.  He is not too sensitive however to stand up for Maggie and also go after  what he wants in life.  This is definitely going to be on my list of  favorite romantic comedies.  Yes, you might guess the ending...but don't be  so sure.  Just when you think the movie is over, it begins again!  Gary  Marshall has quite a sense of humor and it shows.  I laughed throughout  this movie, I felt what the characters were feeling and I loved the plot.~The Rebecca Review",5,"Sweet, sexy and sometimes laugh out loud funny!",965001600,"07 31, 2000",2000,4558,"['DVD', 'definitely', 'way', 'go', 'movie', 'will', 'want', 'instantly', 'play', 'back', 'deliciously', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'where', 'Maggie', 'Carpenter', 'played', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Ike', 'Graham', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'melt', 'screen', 'magical', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'who', 'want', 'find', 'soul', 'mate', 'who', 'want', 'walk', 'beach', 'rain', 'who', 'know', 'one', 'perfect', 'person', 'there.The', 'only', 'problem', 'are', 'human', 'humans', 'have', 'inherent', 'flaw', 'Maggie', 'running', 'altar', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wedding', 'runs', 'horse', 'escapes', 'other', 'creative', 'means', 'variety', 'wedding', 'scene', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'gave', 'movie', 'feel', 'intense', 'creativity.There', 'was', 'more', 'going', 'movie', 'would', 'ever', 'imagine', 'first', 'viewing', 'recommend', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'director', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'narration', 'sense', 'humor', 'commentary', 'version', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'will', 'so', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'what', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'why', 'ideas', 'were', 'carried', 'movie', 'e.g', 'bell', 'theme', 'literally', 'watched', 'movie', 'then', 'watched', 'again', 'commentary', 'version.On', 'occasion', 'do', 'find', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'only', 'more', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'way', 'Julia', 'smile', 'superbly', 'creative', 'script', 'gave', 'movie', 'good', 'dose', 'down', 'home', 'appeal', 'really', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'living', 'town', 'so', 'cute', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'great', 'effort', 'went', 'making', 'sure', 'everything', 'looked', 'perfect', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'guys', 'movie', 'plenty', 'sports', 'scenes', 'Maggie', 'fourth', 'husband', 'be', 'sport', 'fan', 'coach.While', 'being', 'pulled', 'imagining', 'how', 'Maggie', 'Ike', 'will', 'get', 'together', 'start', 'care', 'characters', 'development', 'characters', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'writing', 'superb', 'directing', 'movie', 'three', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'strange', 'was', 'part', 'where', 'Maggie', 'kept', 'engagement', 'rings', 'would', 'not', 'happen', 'too', 'often', 'real', 'life', 'women', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'nonetheless', 'be', 'truthful', 'women', 'have', 'secret', 'desires', 'are', 'revealed', 'parts', 'movie', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'commentary', 'part', 'relationship', 'learning', 'other', 'becoming', 'better', 'person', 'what', 'loved', 'movie', 'characters', 'fight', 'other', 'friends', 'are', 'there', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'accept', 'one', 'perfect.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Maggie', 'literally', 'bolting', 'wedding', 'horse', 'then', 'Ike', 'Graham', 'trying', 'finish', 'writing', 'article', 'newspaper', 'column', 'New', 'York', 'interesting', 'character', 'who', 'girl', 'Hale', 'Maryland', 'who', 'call', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'reading', 'column', 'Maggie', 'witty', 'humorous', 'letter', 'time', 'Ike', 'road', 'town', 'get', 'real', 'story', 'Convinced', 'will', 'catch', 'running', 'next', 'wedding', 'accidently', 'spell', 'One', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'when', 'Maggie', 'not', 'interested', 'talking', 'Ike', 'simply', ""'d"", 'love', 'stay', 'chat', 'still', 'have', 'job', 'bantering', 'so', 'amusing', 'loved', 'playful', 'scenes', 'watch', 'way', 'end', 'credits', 'will', 'see', 'one', 'thought', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'appropriate', 'scene', 'Yes', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'music', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'fun', 'were', 'also', 'host', 'familiar', 'actors', 'gave', 'movie', 'sense', 'know', 'people', 'loved', 'slapstick', 'quirky', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Maggie', 'best', 'friend', 'are', 'great', 'girl', 'talk', 'moments', 'friends', 'tell', 'other', 'honestly', 'how', 'feel.Julia', 'Roberts', 'childlike', 'joy', 'movie', 'smile', 'cost', 'DVD', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'Then', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'cat', 'Ike', 'sensitive', 'nature', 'not', 'too', 'sensitive', 'however', 'stand', 'up', 'Maggie', 'also', 'go', 'what', 'life', 'definitely', 'going', 'be', 'list', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Yes', 'might', 'guess', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'sure', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'again', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'quite', 'sense', 'humor', 'laughed', 'movie', 'felt', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'feeling', 'loved', 'plot.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

I have seen virtually every movie in my local video store, and I frequently find myself renting of the ones that I haven't seen, the one that I think I will dislike least.  That is how I rented THE RUNAWAY BRIDE.I had been scared away from this one because of the utterly horrible reviews from when it first came out.  I remember the film even made some Worse Movies of the Year lists.  By no stretch of the imagination is this movie deserving of such notoriety.I think two things hurt this film when it came out.  One, NOTTING HILL had come out a month or two earlier, and it was easily one of the best films Julia Roberts had ever done.  This one suffered somewhat by comparison with that much better film.  Two, the comparison with PRETTY WOMAN.  The latter is, by any criterion, a better film.But I think anyone expecting this film to be a shaggy dog of a movie will be pleasantly surprised.  It has a couple of major problems, the main one being a very weak script.  There are some good ideas in it, and the basic premise is a fine one for a light romantic comedy.  But overall the film lacks a sense of balance, and while other things might account for this (direction and editing, for instance), in this case the fault seems to lie with the script.On the other hand, the cast is pretty strong.  A number of the supporting characters were very fine, and Gere and Roberts were both quite enjoyable.So, if you are like me, and have been avoiding this one because of the reviews when it came out, I would encourage you to take a risk.

I want to make two things very very clear. If not for one specific scene... I would have given this movie one star.So, anyway, it's a movie about this guy who falls in love with this girl, because she's really really beautiful and self confident, but then he finds out that she's married to this really big fat guy too... who's way way older than her, and way richer than he is. So then he's all broken-hearted.... so then he sort of goes through this flower period, where he realizes that he was wrong and that he needs to sort of... re-birth.And he does... and he becomes this really amazing sensative guy, and travels all over the globe in search of the meaning of world peace. Then, while he's feeding starving children in Africa, he meets the girl in some swanky hotel where he's giving one of his peacful speeches. And she sees the man who he's turned into... so different from the skinny little boy next door who threw snow balls at her on the way to school.At least, that's is what I feel has happened INSIDE of him. Because when he sees her again he feels like a different person since the last time he met her. He didn't really go to africa and all that, but that's what the movie was trying to say... that in his heart, to become a better person for her... he went to Africa.it's really really touching.",5,runaway hit!,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,1447,"['So', 'saw', 'movie', 'once', 'guy', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'grey', 'hair', 'JULIA', 'ROBERTS', 'First', 'want', 'make', 'two', 'things', 'very', 'very', 'clear', 'not', 'one', 'specific', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'one', 'star.So', 'anyway', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'love', 'girl', 'really', 'really', 'beautiful', 'self', 'confident', 'then', 'out', 'married', 'really', 'big', 'fat', 'guy', 'too', 'who', 'way', 'way', 'older', 'way', 'richer', 'So', 'then', 'broken-hearted', 'so', 'then', 'sort', 'flower', 'period', 'where', 'was', 'wrong', 'sort', 're-birth.And', 'really', 'amazing', 'sensative', 'guy', 'travels', 'globe', 'search', 'meaning', 'world', 'peace', 'Then', 'feeding', 'starving', 'children', 'Africa', 'girl', 'swanky', 'hotel', 'where', 'giving', 'one', 'peacful', 'speeches', 'man', 'who', 'turned', 'so', 'different', 'skinny', 'little', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'threw', 'snow', 'balls', 'way', 'school.At', 'least', 'what', 'feel', 'happened', 'INSIDE', 'when', 'again', 'different', 'person', 'last', 'time', 'met', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'africa', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'heart', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'went', 'Africa.it', 'really', 'really', 'touching']",N/A

I'm also a big fan of (incredibly handsome) Richard Gere and equally beautiful and wacky Julia Roberts, so I'm not quite sure why I never knew about this film. I was flipping through channels today and ran across it. I was elated to find out the two of them were in a movie together again and they even included ""Pretty Woman""'s Bernard Thompson (played by Hector Elizondo) as the news editor.The film is about a reporter Ike Graham (played by Gere) who is looking for a good cover story and while his ideas leave much to be desired, he runs into a guy at a bar who has a story about a bride Maggie Carpenter (played by Roberts) who keeps running away at weddings. After not verifying many of his facts (this threw me completely because I would think the editor would verify this info before it went to print, mainly to avoid being sued), his ex-wife/boss fires him. But he gets the chance to redeem himself with Elizondo's character. If he would be willing to travel from New York to Maggie's small hometown to talk her family, friends and try to talk to her to find out why she runs.I read all the criticism about the film being predictable (it was), too cutesy (remove the ""too"" and it was) and Julia Roberts is too old (couldn't DISAGREE more) to be in romantic comedies, and complaining about how this wasn't as good as ""Pretty Woman"" (I disagree again). I want to focus on the last complaint though. This film had a completely different plot from ""Pretty Woman."" It wasn't supposed to be like their first film. Their acting has not changed. Their chemistry is better than any lab report could create. And the plot was interesting to watch.I liked the film from beginning to end. From the eggs stories, I could already tell what her issue was, but I was surprised it took her so long to figure it out. Then again, if she did the film would be 20 minutes long.

131020,AJ8GAKE5DRTBJ,0792164482,"""smu132""","[2, 3]","&quot;Runaway Bride&quot; is a charming little romantic comedy about a girl who can't commit. Richard Gere plays Ike Ghram, a female-bashing journalist who's had a bad run of luck with women, and Julia Roberts plays Maggie Carpenter, a complex woman who can't seem to settle down. Though there's nothing particularly spectacular about this film, I really can't find anything wrong with it either. Again, we get to see what wonderful chemistry Richard and Julia have. When they look in to eachothers' eyes, sparks fly! STILL! Even after 10 years!!The casting is wonderful (as I will elaborate on in a moment), the script is witty, the exchanges between Julia and on-screen pal, Joan Cusack are both endearing and comically amusing, and the story provides a little more complexity and sophistication in the end than we expect.Two things I loved about this film:1) It serves as enough of a sequel to &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; to satisfy fans.Not only do we see a renunion of the beloved couple, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; director, Gary Marshall returns to direct this charming little romantic comedy as well. As if that wasn't enough, pay close attention to some of the other minor characters in &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;...*First, Hector Elizondo, who played hotel manager, Bernard Thompson in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; is Fisher, Ike's buddy in &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;.*Larry Miller played Mr. Hollister, the manager of the shop in Beverly Hills in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. In &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;, he played the bartender at the bar in NYC that Ike hangs out at. Interesting, huh. But wait - there's more...*Patrick Richwood a.k.a. &quot;Dennis&quot; the bellhop from &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; is a TV Host in the town of Hale in &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;. As if that wasn't enough fun,*Marvin Braverman, the room service waiter who Julia didn't tip in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; plays the t-shirt vendor from the NYC streets in &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;.Now that I've given away some of the obvious stuff, see if you can pick up some of the other fun little subtle things that happen in the film that are reminiscent of &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;...2)The producers could have renamed this film &quot;The Life Story of Julia Roberts&quot;Anyone who follows Hollywood knows Ms. Roberts' track record. She's dated Liam Neeson, Dylan McDermott, Matthew Perry, and the list goes on. She was engaged to Kieffer Sutherland but changed her mind the night before the wedding. She finally wed Lyle Lovett but divorced after less than 2 years. When &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; was released, Julia was with Benjamin Bratt, who everyone thought was &quot;the one&quot;. But they seperated in early 2002 after 4 years together. Rumors flew that it was because Benjamin wanted to commit but Julia didn't. We'll never know. Still, it seemed as though her streak would continue.This is another reason why I find this film so amusing. It's almost as if Julia has left her body and is watching herself dump man after man!Just recently, however, our real-life runaway bride tied the knot with Danny Moder, a cameraman who she met on, I belive, the set of &quot;The Mexican&quot;.

131021,ANHGGQT4HTEK0,0792164482,Sonia,"[7, 15]","I think there reaches a point in the lives of many a movie star, where they get too big for their britches and decide, ""Gee, I'm so famous.  Everyone loves me.  My movies are always the best.  I get paid millions per picture.""  I have had it about up to here (imagine my hand at eye level) with Julia Roberts.  I am of the firm belief that beauty and charm do not an actor make.Allow me to expound on some of the sickeningly contrived plotline for you.  We first meet Ike Graham (Richard Gere), a columnist for USA Today, whose inspirations for his column come very last minute, and often as a result of an interesting conversation with a tavern drunk.  The audience tags along on just such a day when Ike learns from a barstool companion about a girl from his hometown who has left somewhere in the neighborhood of seven or eight men at the alter.Fast forward, Ike writes a woman-bashing article about the hometown girl, Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) which is nothing short of slanderous.  She takes umbrage with this bit of irresponsible journalism and fires off a letter, stating she has left three men at the alter and is planning to wed soon, attempt number four.  She also attacks other aspects of his article, point by point.One must ask....wouldn't this person have people above him in the chain of command at USA Today who would never have allowed such reckless journalism to go unchecked?  Never fear, justice prevails!  Per the recommendation of legal counsel, USA Today kicks blasphemer Graham out on his can.  Although, his editor probably deserved some kind of reprimand as well.  Even big shot columnists need to remember, sticks and stones may break your bones, but WORDS can hurt just as badly.  So, licking his wounds, Graham goes after the REAL story about Maggie Carpenter, black widow of brides.  He is seeking to redeem his good name when he makes the trek to Hale, Maryland.Idiotic premise number one: since when does rural America mimic a Norman Rockwell painting?  As a denizen of rural Iowa, I am disgusted with the Hollywood stereotype of small towns.  Not everyone drives a tractor around town, not everyone knows everyone else, and not every small business owner hangs a cute little homemade sign in their shop window that says, ""Be back in five minutes"" so they can go see Earl at the corner barbershop for a quick shave and a haircut.  A good example of Hollywood's rural misconception is another Julia Roberts flick, Sleeping With The Enemy.  This story took place in Cedar Falls, Iowa.  A town I know and love, having been born there and having finished my elementary school years there.  Cedar Falls is a town of about thirty-five thousand, in addition to being home to the University of Northern Iowa, which boasts a student body of nearly fifteen thousand.  Yet, in that lame movie, there are bright smiling people standing around with their cows watching the American flag being raised in the town square.  Gimme a break.  Last time I checked, many towns have a leash law for dogs.  Taking your favorite bovine for a stroll downtown is not in the cards folks. Idiotic premise number two: a woman who repeatedly leaves men at the alter is still loveable and cute, just a little mixed up.  Hello?  I thought about going to [...] to find out what a psychologist might have to say about such a person.  But, I thought the better of it and asked a psychologist friend, actual real live guy, and asked him.Is a woman who repeatedly leaves men standing at the alter screwed up in the head?  YES!  He didn't use the phrase ""screwed up in the head"", that's what I said, he said some doctor stuff that I'm not smart enough to recall, but he basically concurred with my observation that Julia Roberts' character is cuckoo for cocoa puffs (this, also, is not a technical term according) and in need of some therapy.Idiotic premise number three: Julia Roberts and Richard Gere only make great movies.  Those two together in a film doesn't necessarily mean the movie is going to be any good.  It might make a lot of money, sure, but as for artistic integrity, not one iota.You may be hoping to see an updated, slightly different version of their first go-round Pretty Woman.  While Pretty Woman was a stretch story-wise and basically cornball, it was well-thought out and endearing anyway.  The mega stars seemed to put a little more stock in that one, with well-rounded characters and following the story through to the end.  Runaway Bride seems to have been an ant at a picnic for Gere and Roberts.  Annoying, but not much they can do about it, so continue on with the picnic.  Their acting is without conviction and about as multi-dimensional as a piece of paper.  In a nutshell, Runaway Bride is a predictable, blah movie.  There are some nice moments but they don't come often enough to pick things up.",1,2 hours of your life you'll never get back,969667200,"09 23, 2000",2000,4833,"['think', 'point', 'lives', 'many',

""Pop Culture Addict""","[0, 2]","Lightweight and sugary are two words that can be used to describe Garry Marshall's &quot;Runaway Bride.&quot;  Surprisingly another word that can be used to describe this film is entertaining.  While the re-teaming of Marshall, Julia Roberts, and Richard Gere for a second time does not produce as memorable a time as their first effort, ""Pretty Woman"" (1990), &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; is still enjoyable in its own sweet way.A drunk tells reporter Ike Graham (Gere) a strange story of a woman named Maggie Carpenter (Roberts) who has a strange habit of developing cold feet at the altar over and over again.  This tale inspires him to write a nasty article about her that eventually results in a reply from Carpenter.  He becomes intrigued by this feisty woman and travels to her hometown to investigate her further.  Carpenter is annoyed with his snooping but eventually the pair is drawn to one another and true love blossoms in the best cinematic fairy-tale fashion.Sure, it will not take you long to figure out how ""Runaway Bride"" will end once you start watching it, but the film still works thanks to the direction by veteran Marshall, the natural charm of the two leads and strong supporting performances by Paul Dooley, Joan Cusack, Jean Schertler, and Christopher Meloni, Rita Wilson, and Hector Elizondo.  There is nothing deep or profound to be found in this film as it is basically a modern-day version of a Seventies-era sit-com with all its formulaic conventions intact.  Accept it on those terms and you'll find that ""Runaway Bride"" is a harmless romantic comedy that will put a smile on your face and a skip in your step.

Women don't usually run away from getting married, it's usually the men. So I assumed this was going to be a really bad joke with some pleasant looking actors. Well, I was wrong. This movie isn't really about a woman running away from commitment. It's about what many women experience as they lose themselves when they get married.Let me just back up a little . . . Once the 60's hit women began to demand more from their romantic relationships. Divorce went up, supposedly because of the pill and those &quot;damned feminists.&quot; A common theme came out of that: Women were not getting enough from their partners. (Hell, they're still not.) Anyway, lots of men, even today, gripe about how more women ask for divorce than men.This movie is the answer to those concerns! No one wants to watch a movie about a woman who is married for 20 years and then decides she's not happy because she lost herself to the man. It wouldn't even be a comedy. What the makers of this film did was back up and expose the woman being forced to change BEFORE she got married. It's the setup that allows this to be a feel good comedy instead of a dreary drama about divorce.Some people have said that this movie should have ended before the Fed Ex truck scene. Such an argument completely ignores the meaning of this film. Julia Robert's character hadn't grown. She needed to find out why she kept running away from relationships. Come to think of it, it's REALLY annoying to think that anyone believes the movie should have ended sooner. This movie is not about finding your prince and living happily ever after. It's about finding oneself first and then committing to the right person. There's a big difference.What I first thought was going to be an misogynistic joke actually turned out to be a critique of the entire western concept of marriage - that a woman has to lose her identity to get married. As a result, it subtlety gives men the message to wise up.I loved this film! (And by the way, I'm a guy.) I think every heterosexual woman should drag their boyfriend or spouse to this. They might learn something about themselves and teach the person they're with a little something as well. The only problem is, will they get the underlying message?
