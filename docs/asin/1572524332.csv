The plotline and characters are so befuddled that you can't imagine anyone else having the guts to make it.  The lack of energy is sometimes irratating, but you can't look away; it's like an understated Joycean dream sequence.",3,First Name: Carmen,983404800,"03 1, 2001",2001,305,"['Godard', 'confidence', 'filmmaking', 'being', 'completely', 'indifferent', 'plotline', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'befuddled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'having', 'guts', 'make', 'lack', 'energy', 'sometimes', 'irratating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'understated', 'Joycean', 'dream', 'sequence']",N/A
187478,A280GY5UVUS2QH,1572524332,Doug Anderson,"[4, 7]","Godard has high ideas about cinema but the fact  is that ideas alone are not that entertaining.  Some of his films are a lot more entertaining than others though. In the entertaining and watchable category I would name Breathless, Alphaville, Pierrot Le Fou, and First Name:Carmen. I have not seen all of  his films but these I find to be not only brainy films but entertaining ones as well.  I think my favorites are Breathless and Pierrot Le Fou because Belmondo provides the perfect earthen foil for Godardian discourse. I think Breathless and Pierrot le Fou work best of all of his films because of these two distinct but complimentary sensibilities. We watch movies to be entertained after all and in these two films you are entertained;  your brain is entertained thanks to Godard and the rest of you is entertained by Belmondo.First Name:Carmen is very much like Pierrot Le Fou in that it seems to be in constant rebellion against itself-- it is all a chaos as Godard likes it and yet there is also within the chaos a discernible and satisfying Godardian discourse which develops magically as well. Godard like all the other New Wavers loves genre films and no matter how much he may make fun of the cinematic devices used by old Hollywood he also loves them and so his parodies of old Hollywood noirs and thrillers are also homages. They are fun to watch because we as filmgoers know all the Hollywood cliches but we enjoy them nonetheless even as we make fun of them. Godard wants to constantly remind us that we are watching a film not reality but he is best when he does this in an entertaining way.  We are all familiar with Godards techniques -- we have assimilated his style and his brand of discourse -- however his irreverence and his searching among the detritus of modernism for a genuine contact with life (if not his politics) remain as relevant as ever. The failure of the political aspect of his career is perhaps what Godard is lamenting in Carmen. He wanted to be a revolutionary but in the end he has to accept that he is just a film maker. Godard is best when he is inspired by a muse and Marushka Detmers looks like she just walked off a 1940's film noir set.  I suspect Detmers smoldering good looks as much as anything else got Godard excited about film again. All revolutionaries mellow with time and here Godard is touchingly leaving the political behind and returning to his original love, film.I enjoy Godard when he seems to be enjoying himself and he seems to be enjoying himself in this film as he did in Pierrot Le Fou. Of course it is Godard so you will be thinking rigorously throughout about &quot;reality&quot; and how  adept film is at avoiding it and how good Godard is at manipulating the cinematic language for his own ends. Lurking within the chaotic plot are those deep Godardian discoveries you expect when watching one of his films and that make them(the best ones) more than worth your while.",5,One of Godards Watchable Films,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,2942,"['Godard', 'high', 'ideas', 'cinema', 'fact', 'ideas', 'alone', 'are', 'not', 'entertaining', 'films', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining', 'others', 'entertaining', 'watchable', 'category', 'would', 'name', 'Breathless', 'Alphaville', 'Pierrot', 'Le', 'Fou', 'First', 'Name', 'Carmen', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'films', 'find', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'brainy', 'films', 'entertaining', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'favorites', 'are', 'Breathless', 'Pierrot', 'Le', 'Fou', 'Belmondo', 'perfect', 'earthen', 'foil', 'Godardian', 'discourse', 'think', 'Breathless', 'Pierrot', 'le', 'Fou', 'work', 'best', 'films', 'two', 'distinct', 'complimentary', 'sensibilities', 'watch', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'entertained', 'brain', 'entertained', 'thanks', 'Godard', 'rest', 'entertained', 'Belmondo.First', 'Name', 'Carmen', 'very', 'much', 'Pierrot', 'Le', 'Fou', 'be', 'constant', 'rebellion', 'chaos', 'Godard', 'yet', 'also', 'chaos', 'discernible', 'satisfying', 'Godardian', 'discourse', 'magically', 'as', 'well', 'Godard', 'other', 'New', 'Wavers', 'genre', 'films', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'may', 'make', 'fun', 'cinematic', 'devices', 'used', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'so', 'parodies', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'noirs', 'thrillers', 'are', 'also', 'homages', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'because', 'filmgoers', 'know', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'enjoy', 'nonetheless', 'even', 'make', 'fun', 'Godard', 'constantly', 'remind', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'not', 'reality', 'best', 'when', 'entertaining', 'way', 'are', 'familiar', 'Godards', 'techniques', 'have', 'assimilated', 'style', 'brand', 'discourse', 'however', 'irreverence', 'searching', 'detritus', 'modernism', 'genuine', 'contact', 'life', 'not', 'politics', 'remain', 'as', 'relevant', 'ever', 'failure', 'political', 'aspect', 'career', 'perhaps', 'what', 'Godard', 'lamenting', 'Carmen', 'wanted', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'end', 'accept', 'just', 'film', 'maker', 'Godard', 'best', 'when', 'inspired', 'muse', 'Marushka', 'Detmers', 'just', 'walked', 'off', '1940', 'film', 'noir', 'set', 'suspect', 'Detmers', 'smoldering', 'good', 'looks', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'got', 'Godard', 'excited', 'film', 'again', 'revolutionaries', 'time', 'here', 'Godard', 'touchingly', 'leaving', 'political', 'behind', 'returning', 'original', 'love', 'film.I', 'enjoy', 'Godard', 'when', 'be', 'enjoying', 'be', 'enjoying', 'film', 'did', 'Pierrot', 'Le', 'Fou', 'course', 'Godard', 'will', 'be', 'thinking', 'rigorously', 'quot', 'reality', 'quot', 'how', 'adept', 'film', 'avoiding', 'how', 'good', 'Godard', 'manipulating', 'cinematic', 'language', 'own', 'ends', 'Lurking', 'chaotic', 'plot', 'are', 'deep', 'Godardian', 'discoveries', 'expect', 'when', 'watching', 'one', 'films', 'make', 'best', 'ones', 'more', 'while']",N/A

This is dissapointing, but it still looks and sounds somewhat better than the previous video release of  the film. And it is a very good movie anyhow. His 1979 picture, &quot;Slow  Motion&quot; is generally considered Godard's return to his New Wave roots,  but I don't really agree. I think that it's found in this film, in which  Godard once again plays with the construction of narrative form like he did  in the 60's. The style of this film and those films is similar, whereas  much of his later work is extremely dense and cerebral. I'm not disparaging  those pictures; I love many of them. But I find that most people tend to  love his older stuff and avoid his later stuff...so I'm saying that this  film would probably make fans of the older films quite happy. It makes  remarkable use of Beethoven's music as performed by a string quartet that  we see rehearsing on camera (see, this is the kind of stuff you expect from  Godard, right?) as well as a great Tom Waits song, &quot;Ruby's Arms&quot;.",5,An extraordinary film...Godard returns to his roots.,954720000,"04 3, 2000",2000,1123,"['certainly', 'true', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'saying', 'dissapointing', 'still', 'somewhat', 'better', 'previous', 'video', 'release', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'anyhow', '1979', 'picture', 'quot', 'Slow', 'Motion', 'quot', 'generally', 'considered', 'Godard', 'return', 'New', 'Wave', 'roots', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'agree', 'think', 'found', 'film', 'Godard', 'once', 'again', 'plays', 'construction', 'narrative', 'form', 'did', '60', 'style', 'film', 'films', 'similar', 'whereas', 'much', 'later', 'work', 'extremely', 'dense', 'cerebral', ""'m"", 'not', 'disparaging', 'pictures', 'love', 'many', 'find', 'most', 'people', 'tend', 'love', 'older', 'stuff', 'avoid', 'later', 'stuff', 'so', ""'m"", 'saying', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'fans', 'older', 'films', 'quite', 'happy', 'remarkable', 'use', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'performed', 'string', 'quartet', 'see', 'rehearsing', 'camera', 'see', 'kind', 'stuff', 'expect', 'Godard', 'right', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'song', 'quot', 'Ruby', 'Arms', 'quot']",N/A
