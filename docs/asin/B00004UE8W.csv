I have seen so many gay-themed, low budget films that have been a waste of time and was worried that this would be just another one. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and that I enjoyed this film. It has kind of an overall dark flavor and, at times, the characters seem a bit unreal but overall, their performances are believable.Oliver Beck, the main character, is the best part of the movie. I loved his relationship with his sister, tragic though it was.

It's just a story about people, and their sexuality is secondary.It does not have the look of a typical low budget movie.

552339,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00004UE8W,D. Litton,"[10, 11]","A few hackneyed plot twists I can forgive, as long as the plot is lucid enough to keep them in an order that's pleasing to the eye. But &quot;In The Flesh&quot; crosses the line, throwing so many twists at us that are predictable and shallow, and ruin what could potentially pass as a good movie. But that, along with boring characters played by actors who seem to have little interest in the plot, drags the movie into the depths of a Blockbuster rental bin, to be looked at and passed over for something better.Don't let the twists fool you: the plot is simpler than the producers would have you think. It centers around closeted detective Philip Kirsch (Ed Corbin), who has been assigned to working a local gay bar, believed to be an underground drug ring. There, he trades many furtive glances with regular hustler Oliver (Dane Ritter), and the two hook up for a night.And wouldn't you know it, that big, hulking, macho cop Philip finds his soft spot once again? He follows Oliver around like a lost puppy, searching his medical files (isn't he a cop?), coming to his rescue as his alibi when Oliver becomes the prime suspect in a suspense-less murder case, and inviting him to live in his house until he finds a place of his own. But the real killer is still at large, and so are Oliver's less-than-interesting feelings of mistrust and inner torment.So what does all of this result in? A lot of frustration for the viewers, especially those of us who would like to see something, ANYTHING, happen to these characters of any interest. Oh, there are moments, ones that tease us, making us think something big is about it happen, but nothing comes of it.Take the relationship between the two leads, for example. Simple logic tells us that, in any independent gay film, if two men find themselves attracted to one another, then we will at least be granted the privilege of seeing some hot lip-locking. In &quot;In The Flesh,&quot; we get to see a gratuitous sex scene between a male and female, but not so much as a puckering of lips for our stumbling casanovas.If that isn't disappointing enough, the plot is a mess. It throws in secondary characters for its own convenience, such as Oliver's sister, who is a junkie that has become so dependant on narcotics that she will die without them. This provides an explanation for the drugs Philip finds in Oliver's belongings. One of Philip's cop buddies will play a role in the film's finale, in a contrived twist that seems desperate and tired.I don't know which of the characters I disliked more: the wooden, macho Philip, or hustler Oliver, the martyr of the movie whose several outbursts of emotional turmoil are more of an annoyance than a relatable feeling. The movie wants to be provocative in portraying how people builds emotional blocks when a catastrophic event traumatizes their lives, but it comes off as cheesy and unbelievable, and even actions the characters take reverse our emotions for them, even turning us against them.I wanted to like &quot;In the Flesh,&quot; because I enjoy movies that aren't afraid to take on gay subject matter. But that doesn't mean that every movie I see with this type of material is going to be an Oscar-worthy effort. In fact, this is one of the most emotionless attempts I've seen in a while. You have to give it credit as an independent film, for being a mark higher than other films, but everything in this movie is hit-or-miss, and what's going on in these characters' heads is anyone's guess.",2,Emotionally empty and devoid of interest.,1003017600,"10 14, 2001",2001,3493,"['few', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'twists', 'can', 'forgive', 'as', 'long', 'plot', 'lucid', 'enough', 'keep', 'order', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'quot', 'Flesh', 'quot', 'line', 'throwing', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'are', 'predictable', 'shallow', 'ruin', 'what', 'could', 'potentially', 'pass', 'good', 'movie', 'boring', 'characters', 'played', 'actors', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'little', 'interest', 'plot', 'movie', 'depths', 'Blockbuster', 'rental', 'bin', 'be', 'looked', 'passed', 'something', 'better.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'twists', 'fool', 'plot', 'simpler', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'around', 'closeted', 'detective', 'Philip', 'Kirsch', 'Ed', 'Corbin', 'who', 'been', 'assigned', 'working', 'local', 'gay', 'bar', 'believed', 'be', 'underground', 'drug', 'ring', 'many', 'furtive', 'glances', 'regular', 'hustler', 'Oliver', 'Dane', 'Ritter', 'two', 'hook', 'up', 'night.And', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'big', 'hulking', 'macho', 'cop', 'Philip', 'soft', 'spot', 'once', 'again', 'Oliver', 'lost', 'puppy', 'searching', 'medical', 'files', ""n't"", 'cop', 'coming', 'rescue', 'alibi', 'when', 'Oliver', 'prime', 'suspect', 'suspense-less', 'murder', 'case', 'inviting', 'live', 'house', 'place', 'own', 'real', 'killer', 'still', 'large', 'so', 'are', 'Oliver', 'less-than-interesting', 'feelings', 'mistrust', 'inner', 'torment.So', 'what', 'result', 'lot', 'frustration', 'viewers', 'especially', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'something', 'ANYTHING', 'happen', 'characters', 'interest', 'Oh', 'are', 'moments', 'ones', 'tease', 'making', 'think', 'something', 'big', 'happen', 'nothing', 'it.Take', 'relationship', 'two', 'leads', 'example', 'Simple', 'logic', 'tells', 'independent', 'gay', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'find', 'attracted', 'one', 'then', 'will', 'least', 'be', 'granted', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'hot', 'lip-locking', 'quot', 'Flesh', 'quot', 'get', 'see', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scene', 'male', 'female', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'puckering', 'lips', 'stumbling', 'casanovas.If', ""n't"", 'disappointing', 'enough', 'plot', 'mess', 'secondary', 'characters', 'own', 'convenience', 'such', 'Oliver', 'sister', 'who', 'junkie', 'become', 'so', 'dependant', 'narcotics', 'will', 'die', 'explanation', 'drugs', 'Philip', 'Oliver', 'belongings', 'One', 'Philip', 'cop', 'buddies', 'will', 'play', 'role', 'film', 'finale', 'contrived', 'twist', 'desperate', 'tired.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'characters', 'disliked', 'more', 'wooden', 'macho', 'Philip', 'hustler', 'Oliver', 'martyr', 'movie', 'several', 'outbursts', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'are', 'more', 'annoyance', 'relatable', 'feeling', 'movie', 'be', 'provocative', 'portraying', 'how', 'people', 'builds', 'emotional', 'blocks', 'when', 'catastrophic', 'event', 'lives', 'off', 'cheesy', 'unbelievable', 'even', 'actions', 'characters', 'take', 'reverse', 'emotions', 'even', 'turning', 'them.I', 'wanted', 'like', 'quot', 'Flesh', 'quot', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'take', 'gay', 'subject', 'matter', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'see', 'type', 'material', 'going', 'be', 'Oscar-worthy', 'effort', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'emotionless', 'attempts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'independent', 'film', 'being', 'mark', 'higher', 'other', 'films', 'everything', 'movie', 'hit-or-miss', 'what', 'going', 'characters', 'heads', 'anyone', 'guess']",N/A

But...I disagree on the actors being bad.  I found them believable, both of them.  I can usually tell when two actors are able to have chemistry and these two have it in spades.  Sure, the lack of sexual encounter is more based on the cop's not wanting to take advantage of his somewhat 'vulnerable' lover.  Young lover is taking psych in college, but it's the cop that's got the psyche down pat.  When Oliver offers him sex free of charge as payment for taking him in, Phillip says, ""I've had it[the sex].  It's not about that."" I think it's great there's a gay film out there that shows a gay guy who's hot for another gay guy, and yet he practices restraint.  It focuses on the romance of the characters rather than the plot or the sexual connotation.  The cuddling in the bed is touching and when Oliver tries to sabotage the relationship, Ole' Phillip won't back down and literally slugs Oliver to get him out of the 'whorehouse'.  It's not a dominant/submissive kind of coupling.  It's balanced.  Both have their strong and weak points.The writing ..., it's flimsy, but I ignored the writing in favor of watching the relationship develop.  Plus...I loved the music!!

552344,A30R6HEYBNOJX8,B00004UE8W,J. Edkin,"[11, 11]","In my mind, ""In the Flesh"" belongs to the second wave of queer cinema.  The first wave were the coming out stories where the existence of gay characters and themes was to explore what it means to be gay.  In the second wave, the gay characters exist not solely to be gay, but on an equal playing field where their homosexuality is simply part of who they are in the context of a larger story.  In this case, the story is a murder mystery.  As refreshing as it is to have a story with gay characters where the story isn't about being gay and as agreeable as the movie is on many levels, it's not a very good murder mystery.Oliver (Dane Ritter) is a hustler in Atlanta and thankfully writer/director Ben Taylor doesn't make him into the two stereotypes you often find in movies about prostitutes--he is neither the whore with the heart of gold, nor is he a strung-out junkie hustling just to get his next fix.  Philip (Ed Corbin) is a cop assigned to investigate drug dealing happening at the Blue Boy, a bar where gay hustlers meet their johns.  Philip and Oliver get to talking and connect on some levels.  Philip hires Oliver, they have sex, and Philip tries to make their connection more than economic.  Oliver resists.  When one of Oliver's regular johns is murdered, Philip intervenes in the investigation, providing Oliver with an alibi and walking away from his job.  The scandal causes Oliver to lose his apartment, Philip invites him to move in, and the two become enmeshed in the murder mystery with Oliver and Philip in danger.I'm sure I just made it sound more logical than it actually is.  Unfortunately, the relationship that is supposed to drive all of the action, that between Oliver and Philip doesn't work.  Part of this is writer/director Taylor's fault.  (He admits that it moves too quickly and that he had to cut a scene that explained how the relationship developed.  In his commentary track, he says that the cut scene is on the DVD.  Unfortunately, it's not, so we'll never know if the scene would have explained everything or not.)  However, actor Ed Corbin has to take some of the blame as well.  He never projects any real warmth, so it's hard to believe that Philip has fallen in love with Oliver.  Dane Ritter's performance is stronger than Corbin's, but I don't sense any romantic or sexual heat from him either.  Because of this, it's hard to believe that Philip would risk his career to help Oliver.  If you don't believe that, then the rest of the movie becomes difficult to accept.On top of that, there is a secret from Oliver's past that is revealed in the course of the movie that both defies logic and police procedure.  I don't want to give the specifics away here, but it doesn't work for me.  On one level, if you know anything about police procedure, the secret won't work for you the secret defies police procedure.  (""Law & Order"" and ""C.S.I."" fans beware!  The strange thing is, Taylor says in his commentary that the scene is based on actual events--although they took place in South Africa--if I recall correctly--so that may explain the difference in crime scene investigation. Unfortunately, the movie's version doesn't, so it's hard to believe that American police investigators didn't see through this lie.)  I simply don't believe the events could have happened the way they are described.  And, in revealing this truth, Philip has to accept something that he as an officer of the law should not be so quick to dismiss.If you can overlook those flaws (and I do, up to a point), this is an enjoyable enough film with a reversal at the end that I appreciated.  Some of Taylor's commentary track is truly interesting, although I think he tells us much more about his personal life than he needs to.My suggestion is that you rent the film before you invest in it.  If you like this, then I highly suggest you check out ""Rites of Passage.""  You might also like ""Skin & Bone"" (which I don't care for personally) and the French film ""Criminal Lovers"" (another that I don't care for, but at least find more interesting than ""Skin & Bone"").(...)2001 Joe Edkin",3,"Amiable, but Illogical",1007856000,"12 9, 2001",2001,4101,"['mind', 'Flesh', 'second', 'wave', 'queer', 'cinema', 'first', 'wave', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'stories', 'where', 'existence', 'gay', 'characters', 'themes', 'was', 'explore', 'what', 'be', 'gay', 'second', 'wave', 'gay', 'characters', 'exist', 'not', 'solely', 'be', 'gay', 'equal', 'playing', 'field', 'where', 'homosexuality', 'simply', 'part', 'who', 'are', 'context', 'larger', 'story', 'case', 'story', 'murder', 'mystery', 'refreshing', 'have', 'story', 'gay', 'characters', 'where', 'story', ""n't"", 'being', 'gay', 'as', 'agreeable', 'movie', 'many', 'levels', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'murder', 'mystery.Oliver', 'Dane', 'Ritter', 'hustler', 'Atlanta', 'thankfully', 'writer/director', 'Ben', 'Taylor', ""n't"", 'make', 'two', 'stereotypes', 'often', 'find', 'movies', 'prostitutes', 'whore', 'heart', 'gold', 'strung-out', 'junkie', 'hustling', 'just', 'get', 'next', 'fix', 'Philip', 'Ed', 'Corbin', 'cop', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'drug', 'dealing', 'happening', 'Blue', 'Boy', 'bar', 'where', 'gay', 'hustlers', 'meet', 'johns', 'Philip', 'Oliver', 'get', 'talking', 'connect', 'levels', 'Philip', 'Oliver', 'have', 'sex', 'Philip', 'make', 'connection', 'more', 'economic', 'Oliver', 'resists', 'When', 'one', 'Oliver', 'regular', 'johns', 'murdered', 'Philip', 'investigation', 'providing', 'Oliver', 'alibi', 'walking', 'away', 'job', 'scandal', 'Oliver', 'lose', 'apartment', 'Philip', 'move', 'two', 'become', 'enmeshed', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Oliver', 'Philip', 'danger.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'made', 'sound', 'more', 'logical', 'actually', 'Unfortunately', 'relationship', 'supposed', 'drive', 'action', 'Oliver', 'Philip', ""n't"", 'work', 'Part', 'writer/director', 'Taylor', 'fault', 'too', 'quickly', 'had', 'cut', 'scene', 'explained', 'how', 'relationship', 'developed', 'commentary', 'track', 'cut', 'scene', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'not', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'explained', 'everything', 'not', 'However', 'actor', 'Ed', 'Corbin', 'take', 'blame', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'projects', 'real', 'warmth', 'hard', 'believe', 'Philip', 'fallen', 'love', 'Oliver', 'Dane', 'Ritter', 'performance', 'stronger', 'Corbin', 'do', ""n't"", 'sense', 'romantic', 'sexual', 'heat', 'hard', 'believe', 'Philip', 'would', 'risk', 'career', 'help', 'Oliver', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'then', 'rest', 'movie', 'difficult', 'accept.On', 'top', 'secret', 'Oliver', 'past', 'revealed', 'course', 'movie', 'defies', 'logic', 'police', 'procedure', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'specifics', 'away', 'here', ""n't"", 'work', 'one', 'level', 'know', 'anything', 'police', 'procedure', 'secret', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'secret', 'defies', 'police', 'procedure', 'Law', 'Order', 'C.S.I', 'fans', 'beware', 'strange', 'thing', 'Taylor', 'commentary', 'scene', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'South', 'Africa', 'recall', 'correctly', 'may', 'explain', 'difference', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigation', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'version', ""n't"", 'hard', 'believe', 'American', 'police', 'investigators', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'lie', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'events', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'way', 'are', 'described', 'revealing', 'truth', 'Philip', 'accept', 'something', 'officer', 'law', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'quick', 'dismiss.If', 'can', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'do', 'up', 'point', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'film', 'reversal', 'end', 'appreciated', 'Taylor', 'commentary', 'track', 'truly', 'interesting', 'think', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'life', 'to.My', 'suggestion', 'rent', 'film', 'invest', 'like', 'then', 'highly', 'suggest', 'check', 'Rites', 'Passage', 'might', 'also', 'Skin', 'Bone', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'personally', 'French', 'film', 'Criminal', 'Lovers', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'least', 'find', 'more', 'interesting', 'Skin', 'Bone', '2001', 'Joe', 'Edkin']",N/A
552345,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B00004UE8W,J. Michael Click,"[0, 0]","Based on the film's title, the graphics on the DVD case showing shirtless boys leaning against cars, and the DVD tag line - ""When you work the streets, trust is the first thing to go"" - a prospective viewer might easily presume that ""In the Flesh"" is a soft porn melodrama about young male prostitutes working the mean streets.  But such a presumption would be a mistake.  Writer-director Ben Taylor's film is actually an engaging (if somewhat slowly paced) whodunnit with an interesting twist, involving a romance between a closeted cop and a sex club hustler suspected of murder.Beautifully photographed and ably directed, ""In the Flesh"" boasts two superior performances by Ed Corbin as the intense older cop and Dane Ritter as the troubled young suspect.  There are some major plot holes in Taylor's script, but the two leading actors manage to gloss them over through their individual charisma and the odd (but ultimately compelling) chemistry they generate between them.  Actress Alex Dawson lends fine support as Chloe, Ritter's jilted coworker, and there is also notable work by Adele Phares as Ritter's junkie sister and Roxzane Mims as Corbin's forceful lieutenant.Despite the fact that ""In the Flesh"" is actually more centered around characters than plot, the ultimate revelation of the film's villain provided a neat little surprise.  Overall, this film seems to have polarized most viewers, with half of them loathing it and the other half cheering it.  Put me in the latter category.  In all fairness, I would suspect that some of the naysayers were at least to some degree set up to be disappointed by the false expectations created by the film's dishonest marketing campaign ... and who can blame them?  The film should have been sold on its own merits, which I found to be plentiful.

Some of the minor actors (the police, the hustlers, the ""girlfriend,"" etc.) are laughable actors, but it's not terribly distracting.Evidently my formative years with strict literature teachers didn't have any affect on some film-makers like this one, who introduces a girlfriend and a bunch of hustlers for absolutely no reason.  He talks in some of the commentary about whether a certain character was necessary for the film.  Here's some advice: If it isn't important to the development of the main characters or plot, it isn't necessary.As a gay action movie, I liked it, and appreciated some fairly daring bare assets, but missed any hint of the boys even kissing?

In this case the locale is Atlanta, where a young hustler (Dane Ritter) is implicated in the brutal murder of one of his johns.  A sympathetic detective (Ed Corbin) provides the boy with an alibi and a place to stay until the storm blows over. Of course the cop is a closet case, and mutual feelings develop between the two men.So far, so good.  The movie's downsides include some uneven acting.  Corbin, who is certainly easy on the eyes, turns in a largely wooden performance and puts one uncomfortably in mind of Gregory Walcott, the square jawed lead from Ed Wood's legendary PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE.  Still his bountiful physical charms often allay this discomfort, and the one stunning shot of his bare backside should have the viewer pressing the PAUSE button.  Ritter, on the other hand, is much more convincing as Oliver. Handsome in an unconventional way, he is magnetic, funny, thoughtful, and sexy.  With the right breaks he could find himself doing more mainstream roles.The movie's biggest disappointment, however, is the rather chaste treatment of the male-male &quot;affair.&quot;  Early in the movie there's a somewhat graphic shot of Oliver and his &quot;girlfriend&quot; enjoying l'amour (another nice moment for lovers of the male derriere), but there isn't even a kiss between Ritter and Corbin, and the viewer sits saying, frustratedly, &quot;Get on with it, you two! Get on with it!&quot;  The excuse is the men do not want to cloud the purity of their feelings with sex.  Right.  Fine.  But no kiss?

I have to chuckle while reading some of the reveiws of In The Flesh because people are saying the story, the scenes, the acting are all implausible.  Have you watched a Hollywood movie lately??  Even the rolling credits of those movies are implausible.I know guys exactly like Phillip Kirsch...the strong, brooding, silent type.  And Oliver is the unlikely prostitute with a heart of gold.  Many viewed this movie as a gay detective-murder-mystery movie.  I didn't.  I saw it as a struggling love story between to supposed opposites--a cop and a prostitute.  Both Phillip and Oliver are sruggling to find middle ground.  Oliver is stuck doing what he does in order to keep perpetuating a bad situation--supporting his sister's drug habit.  Phillip comes off as the straight laced, pure cop who struggles to enjoy life and have fun.I think the movie is much more complex that first meets the eye.  I think there is much more to the alibi than meets the eye.  Does Phillip provide Oliver with an alibi because he fell instantly in love with him or does Phillip, as a cop, instinctively know that Oliver didn't do it and therefore doesn't want to see an innocent person get charged with a crime?One reviewer wrote that the only people who like this film are those who aren't used to seeing gay themed films....WRONG!
