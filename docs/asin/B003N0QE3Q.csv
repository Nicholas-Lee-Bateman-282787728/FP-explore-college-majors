Anderson ""ann0314""","[0, 0]","When I watched the first episode of this show I didn't know what to expect...actually even after the first episode I still was a little unsure what I thought but as I delved more and more into the series I was COMPLETELY HOOKED. I HAD TO watch them all.That being said, the concept of this show is not for everyone. Basic gist is that you are being transported into the mind and world of a serial killer. In this case, said serial killer kills other serial killers to help curb his urge to kill. What I like about the series is how well written it is and how intelligently they have approached the topic. This series goes where no series has gone before. It delves into what makes someone like this ""tick"", how they are different and how they are the same as the rest of society and by the end of the very first season you get to a point of almost understanding what that old debate of nature vs nurture really does stand for. As a matter of fact, it makes you relate so well you are actually able to follow and cheer Dexter on in his pursuits (Although you may feel oddly guilty about it lol) All in all, I really love the series. I highly recommend it for those looking for something very different and fresh (I especially recommend it to those that like shows like Law and Order Criminal Intent and Criminal Minds as this show will go where they would never dare and beyond) A great peek into a mind of madness (or maybe not as mad as you might think!)

Hall, the actor who played David Fischer in Six Feet Under, is a serial killer working for the homicide division in forensics.  However, he only kills serial killers, wraps them up in plastic, cuts their cheeks with a scalpel, and puts a drop on a slide with a glass cover.  He stores it in a box hidden in his the wall when he removes air conditioner - it looks like he has about 100 or so.And he must keep ahead of being found out by his own fellow workers, his family, his girlfriend and other people who could out him.But do the ends justify the means?I think this is left to the audience to decide.  He was found by the police with his dead mother in a pool of blood, his older brother was there as well.  A policeman took him and adopted him as a son, along with his own daughter.  So was the violence he was introduced to as a child the reason he became a serial killer out to avenge his mother's death?  Or can he stop?

This drama can be watched a dvd at a time and last for two weeks of great entertainment.  I would definately say buy this product.  Get familiar with this program, it will be around for a while!  Spoiler alert, in Season 4, I was sad to know his wife died.  This could have been written out, because it is highly unlikely that this would happen in real life.  The only criticism I have about the series is the amount of tail that Dexter's sister Deborah gets.  She is too much of a tramp to like.  Her foul mouth is cute, but overdone sometimes.  The other office romances are also getting in the way.  Like Lt. Leguarta, she has slept with everyone, even wanted Dexter in Season 1.  She needs a toy from sex in the city to solve her issues. I don't think I could watch her in any other movies or shows knowing her charactor in Dexter.  To me, this role has made her tainted goods.

1354513,AJ66SZG3DGVH1,B003N0QE3Q,K.H.,"[5, 33]","NOTE: I wrote and posted this review for Dexter: Seasons 1-3 [Blu-Ray], but obviously I think it still applies to this product.A lot of people rave about ""Dexter"" and it's won awards, which is why I purchased the Blu-Rays. I figured that even though I hadn't ever seen the show, so many people couldn't be wrong. Unfortunately, however, in my opinion, they are. It's certainly not a bad show, it's just not a great, or even a very good, one. I think a lot of the appeal that the show has is the fact that the title character is a serial killer. Throughout the show, you get voice-overs that let you hear what he's thinking and I'm sure that people enjoy the psychological ""peek"" into the mind of a killer. For me, however, it just came across as over-done high school angst. Every episode, you're treated to Dexter's thoughts about how he's ""empty inside"" and ""this should bother me, but it doesn't ...and I like that"" type of thing. After a while, it actually became a little embarrassing to listen to.My other major problem was that the show relies on the viewer completely suspending any and all disbelief. For example, as a spoiler, take the entire issue of Rita's abusive ex-husband, Paul. Here's a guy who Dexter decides needs to ""go away."" So how does he do it? Elegantly and with an elaborate plan that thwarts detection? No. He just smashes the guy in the head while they're in Rita's kitchen and shoots the guy up with heroin that he obtained from, uh, somewhere. I realize the guy was a former drug user and had been in prison, but it's still a rather large stretch to think that right in the middle of a heated custody battle that he's winning, he gets into an argument with his wife's new boyfriend, winds up with a skull fracture, and everyone just ignores it all and he conveniently drops out of the picture. That's pretty lousy writing.That's the problem. There's this phony semblance of tension because, of course, it would be really ridiculous to believe that if I wanted to go kill someone for whatever reason, I could. Even though that's basically what happens. So every so often the writers will attempt to inject a ""ooo, Dexter is just about to get caught!!"" moment into the show. That's basically all of Season 2. Except that when his bodies get discovered, he just breaks into the police station and destroys the cooling system on the temporary morgue and everyone buys that it's a bunch of clumsy garbage men who did it and goes ""aw, shucks."" When they tape him black-lighting his boat and cleaning it of blood, he just pulls a fire alarm in the station and everyone runs outside and he erases the tape. It's almost pathetically silly. They send an FBI man to help with the investigation, but for some reason that agent keeps the FBI organization formally out of it and just acts as a consultant on loan. Uh, what?And it extends to other aspects of the show. The lieutenant is demoted and a woman is then installed as the new lieutenant. She then promptly goes off the deep end because she suspects her boyfriend of cheating. That's plausible. Except that she'll be in the middle of a crime scene with a murder victim and start arguing with her boyfriend on the telephone. Or there will be a huge breakthrough in a murder case and she'll run into the room and demand that someone analyze her boyfriend's shirt that ""smells like a woman"" (that's the actual line). Who buys this stuff? It's at the level of ""recurring joke"" like Joey on ""Friends"" using the line ""how you doin'?"" every time he meets a woman. Literally every scene the new lieutenant was in, she was spazzing out about her boyfriend. If you go back and watch the series, she doesn't ever actually do any police work. I can't even figure out how her character advanced the plot or enhanced the series in any way. It was like the writers said ""we have to distract viewers from our lazy script where Dexter can literally attempt to kill a guy two times unsuccessfully and the guy sees his face and nothing ever comes of it ...I know, we'll write in this crazed lieutenant for comic relief!""And if that doesn't work, how about gratuitous nuidity? It's Showtime, so they blatantly show you the breasts of every single female character at some point. If there's a woman on the series, you will see her breasts. I'm not saying I'm against that, as a guy, but it's like the rest of the series. It's just lazy. There's no real reason to show them, is there?I would rate this show as average. It will certainly pass the time, but it is definitely NOT gripping in any way. The writing is, as stated, very simplistic and lazy. There is nothing mind-blowing or intricate about the series and the premise of a serial-killer performing vigilante killing gets old very fast. The acting is not bad, but fails to make up for the writing. I would recommend against buying the show, as I doubt that you would EVER watch it more than once in your lifetime. It would be worth renting, but I would doubt that you will slog through more than one or two seasons at most. I'm sure I'll catch a lot of heat from people for the review, but that's my opinion.P.S. By the end of Season Two, I can't tell you how annoying Lila was.  Her whiny, nasal British accent sounded like a braying mule (""Daaayxter"") and she has this horrible underbite where her lower lip juts out over her upper lip.",3,Does not meet the
