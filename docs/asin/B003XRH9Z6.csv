Her tenacity is portrayed by the ""string"" wrapped around him every time he feels the brunt of his mother's interference in his life, particularly after he falls in love with her groundskeeper,Bilal.The process of Malik's coming out, especially against the backdrop of the Muslim culture and values, evolves like a fairy tale romance.  Bilal's  masculine beauty and charm, his humility stemming from his subservient position, and the tenderness and passion he ultimately shares with Malik when they consummate their love all make for a beautiful love story.  Malik's Mom, Sara (Cardinale) finds the young men in bed together.  The follow-up is priceless.The acting here is irreproachable, and the production values and cinematography superb.

Other comments that there are editing problems is true. There are just some questionable editing choices that leave you baffled about what just happened and how it plays into the thread (pun intended) of the story. I wish subtitles could have indicated plays on language as the speaking of French and Arabic seemed to be a storytelling device that was completely lost in translation.The idea of the string is clever; it took a minute to catch on, but by the last third of the film has been almost overused.The theme of homosexualty in the Arabic community is an issue but very underplayed. The main theme came across instead to be a troubled parent & child relationship that could play the same without the arabic cultural issue.Things happen a bit too conveniently, but to avoid spoiling the story I won't expand farther. The acting is unconvincing through out, though it could actually be the poor editing that wipes out the actors' thread of character continuity. In an odd way it's almost as if the characters don't seem to have the continuity of story events impressed upon them from scene to scene.

Just like Hollywood used to make them.  Not a maladjusted, self-destructive person in sight.  And that's A-OK with me.But to view this film as an exploration of ""class, cultural and sexual differences"", as the DVD case describes it, is ludicrous.  Malik and Bilal are going to form political parties?  They formed parties all right, but the kind where there's lots of champagne and dancing and everyone is having a good time.  ""The String"" is no more grounded in reality than an Astaire/Rogers movie had anything to do with the Great Depression.Cardinale and Salim Kechiouche are great.  Antonin Stahly is rather stiff, and comes across more as a whiny, spoiled child than as a psychologically damaged man.  (And what is it about the string?  Apron strings maybe?)  Everything about the movie--photography, actors, music--was beautiful.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it for what it is.

This is the mentality that makes me crazy: all the porn-heads who insist upon ghettoizing any film with any homoerotic content whatsoever as ""gay."" True, like the hammer that can only see nails, if you are a fan of soft-core guy-on-guy action, this movie was o.k. at best. If, however, you care about things like subtle undertones, an intrinsically coherent story, good acting and gorgeous photography, this is one very good film. Long-ago sex pot Claudia Cardinale has aged well into that manipulating chienne from hell who sends good gay boys everywhere straight to their shrink's office. Because the movie is Tunisian and sensitive to contemporary Arab attitudes toward same-gender relationships, The String (it's a pun on ""the son"" in French) rises to the status of very, very good film. If, however, eye candy is your sole hunger, the men here are indeed very beautiful, but that is far from the filmmaker's sole preoccupation, and true, you'd be better satisfied elsewhere. Have a nice trip, but absolutely do stay out of the deep end until you are a little more grown up.

1371059,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B003XRH9Z6,Tommy Dooley,"[4, 6]","The String (Le Fil) is a `gay drama'. It tells the story of thirty year old Malik, played by Antonin Stahly, when he returns to the Colonial home of his mother (Claudia Cardinale -Italian icon etc). All she wants is to see him settle down and marry.She employs a number of people including a handyman, played by Salim Kechiouche `Le Clan, `Full Speed). They take a shine to each other and start a secret relationship. Not only do we have the social difference of rich and poor but also the societal and religious Christian and Muslim) pressures as this is set in Tunisia.These issues are all explored and there are some genuinely touching scenes. It is beautifully shot, acted and directed. One thing that bothered me was the actual `string' referenced in the title, it is obviously a metaphor, but they actually use a real one attached to Malik at certain points, to emphasise how his family are holding on to him. Whilst this may be seen a stylistic genius, I found it to be more of an alienation device. That said it did not detract too highly from my enjoyment.I do not want to give any plot spoilers, but this was not all that challenging, more of a gentle love story with some spanners thrown in at certain junctures.  In French and Arabic with subtitles (which are not literal at least in the French, in some parts), this has a run time of 90 mins, perfect for the European market.",4,"Nice film, but not very challenging",1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,1388,"['String', 'Le', 'Fil', 'gay', 'drama', 'story', 'thirty', 'year', 'old', 'Malik', 'played', 'Antonin', 'Stahly', 'when', 'Colonial', 'home', 'mother', 'Claudia', 'Cardinale', '-Italian', 'icon', 'etc', 'see', 'settle', 'down', 'marry.She', 'number', 'people', 'including', 'handyman', 'played', 'Salim', 'Kechiouche', 'Le', 'Clan', 'Full', 'Speed', 'take', 'shine', 'other', 'start', 'secret', 'relationship', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'social', 'difference', 'rich', 'poor', 'also', 'societal', 'religious', 'Christian', 'Muslim', 'set', 'Tunisia.These', 'issues', 'are', 'explored', 'are', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'scenes', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'acted', 'directed', 'One', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'actual', 'string', 'referenced', 'title', 'obviously', 'metaphor', 'actually', 'use', 'real', 'one', 'attached', 'Malik', 'certain', 'points', 'emphasise', 'how', 'family', 'are', 'holding', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'stylistic', 'genius', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'alienation', 'device', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'too', 'highly', 'enjoyment.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'was', 'not', 'challenging', 'more', 'gentle', 'love', 'story', 'spanners', 'thrown', 'certain', 'junctures', 'French', 'Arabic', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'literal', 'least', 'French', 'parts', 'run', 'time', '90', 'mins', 'perfect', 'European', 'market']",N/A
