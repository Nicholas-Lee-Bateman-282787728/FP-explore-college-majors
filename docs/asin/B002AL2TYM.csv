This very busy accountant is very wrapped up in his work, loses his fiancee and finds himself listening to a guy playing the piano in a bar (I think he was having a pop) and they begin talking and the guy takes him home to visit his family. Come to find out, they go to a homeless shelter. He is basically told to do something good. He begins remembering the times he and his mom had sang and played the piano before she died. He had an estranged relationship with his father. Anyhow, he starts a choir, wanting to help the homeless guys earn some money and help them help themselves. He found himself not needing to work at his accounting job so many extra hours overtime but found what was more important. He started to notice a worker at the subway station and they started talking and she suggested they sing there. Well the police broke that up and cited the man for not having a permit; however, they sang well enough to get a permit. The father comes in the picture. Ups and downs with the people of the choir, the father, the new lady, the leader himself occur. Wonderful blessings arose from the two guys meeting for all.",5,Wonderfull movie.

As another reviewer mentioned, there are a few scenes with alcohol and someone being drunk, but it is based on a true story so those scenes don't take away from the overall message of hope, forgiveness, charity, and good will.  The story shows the pain that many of us feel at Christmas and the holiday season when we're reminded of deaths and other losses we've experienced.I'd rate this PG or PG13.  The editing is a little choppy/abrupt because it's made for TV and was made to have commercials between scenes.  Overall it is a keeper in my book--emphasizes the impact of one person's life, and on things that matter most in life.  Heartwarming and genuine, not sappy.  The movie made me look at my own life and at homeless people in a different way (reminded me of the poem about how you spend your life and what will be on your tombstone).I like that I only recognized Rhea Perlman; it's easier for me to enjoy the story line sometimes when I don't know the actors from other roles they've played.

1258513,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B002AL2TYM,J. Olsen,"[38, 39]","This is a good movie. It isn't just a mindless romance of a single parent at Christmastime--as so many Christmas movies are. There is a romance involved, it just isn't the whole story.Peter is a workaholic accountant who has just been dumped by his fiancee. He meets a piano player in a bar who can sense he is down and invites him to ""come home"" with him. ""Home"" turns out to be a homeless shelter run by an outspoken nun who is trying to quit smoking. He spends the evening there, makes a donation and leaves, never expecting to return. But after seeing one of the homeless men the next day being pushed along for loitering, he returns to the shelter and helps serve dinner, much to Sister Agatha's surprise. But he wants to do more. On the way home he sees a group of carolers on the street receiving donations. He has an idea and returns immediately to the shelter to discuss it with Sister Agatha. He wants to form a choir as a way for the men to earn some money for Christmas, but there are obstacles along the way. He has to face Sister Agatha's doubts, the men's mistrust of his motives, their lack of training and discipline, his rocky relationship with his father and his own deteriorated personal life.At first he sees himself as the one doing great things to help these men, but finally comes to see how much they have done to turn his life around. It is an uplifting movie that teaches a good lesson without heavy-handed preaching.The romance is a gentle thread developing throughout the story. It is never suggestive or inappropriate.Amazingly, this movie of a rougher side of life has no rough language. I think the term ""brain-fart"" is as bad as it gets, and we hear that only once. Alcohol abuse is dealt with as one choir member shows up to a performance drunk, violating the ""cardinal rule"".  Peter is very angry, words are exchanged and he quits and walks out on the choir. He ends up drunk himself, which is ironic since in an earlier scene he had expressed his frustration with his own father's alcoholism. I can't think of anything else that might be objectionable to anyone. Things look bleak for a time, but are resolved nicely with an upbeat ending.It is ""based on"" a true story, but take it with a grain of salt. The fine print at the end of the credits indicates that they have fictionalized events for dramatic effect. Still, I think it is a very good Christmas movie that isn't just light fluff--it actually has some meat to it. I would definitely recommend it.

He's a workaholic, socially inept and unhappy.  He encounters a bunch of homeless men in a shelter run by a nun, the ever able and entertaining Rhea Perlman.  She's her usual sweet and sarcastic self.  With her OK, he sets out to start a choir from a ""bunch of losers"".The second theme is about him and his estranged, alcoholic father(superbly done with sublety by Michael Sarrazin), and the third, my favorite, is a very sweet, gradually developing romance with a stranger he meets in the subway, Marianne Farley(who starred in a very bizarre Canadian-French language thriller 'White Skin' aka 'Cannibel').  He doesn't see it coming, but she's determined to help him with his ordeals and perhaps foster a blossoming love.This is a family friendly movie- no real language, nudity, sex, violence; although, the movie is geared for adults, all the characters are basically good people and the ending satisfying.  The actors do a nice job.  Predictable and sweet, it's Hallmark, the movie stresses faith, persistence, and love of people.",5,"Hope, Change, Redemption and Love",1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,1495,"['well', 'made', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'encouraging', 'uplifting', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'what', 'extent', 'actually', 'three', 'plots', 'revolving', 'main', 'character', 'presented', 'somewhat', 'episodic', 'manner', 'together', 'movie', 'progresses.The', 'first', 'involving', 'hero', 'well', 'suited', 'accountant', 'handsomely', 'played', 'Jason', 'Gedrick', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'Hallmark', 'romance', 'Places', 'purpose', 'life', 'needs', 'refining', 'workaholic', 'socially', 'inept', 'unhappy', 'bunch', 'homeless', 'men', 'shelter', 'run', 'nun', 'ever', 'able', 'entertaining', 'Rhea', 'Perlman', 'usual', 'sweet', 'sarcastic', 'self', 'OK', 'out', 'start', 'choir', 'bunch', 'losers', '.The', 'second', 'theme', 'estranged', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'superbly', 'done', 'sublety', 'Michael', 'Sarrazin', 'third', 'favorite', 'very', 'sweet', 'gradually', 'developing', 'romance', 'stranger', 'subway', 'Marianne', 'Farley', 'who', 'starred', 'very', 'bizarre', 'Canadian-French', 'language', 'thriller', 'Skin', 'aka', ""'Cannibel"", ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'determined', 'help', 'ordeals', 'perhaps', 'foster', 'blossoming', 'love.This', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie-', 'real', 'language', 'nudity', 'sex', 'violence', 'movie', 'geared', 'adults', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'good', 'people', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'actors', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'Predictable', 'sweet', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'faith', 'persistence', 'love', 'people']",The Christmas Choir
