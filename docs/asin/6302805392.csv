336977,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,6302805392,Adi Adler,"[43, 45]","This movie gives a new angle on Pre - WW2 German society. The title's 'Swing Kids' are German youngsters who were interested in British and American slag & fashions. Since Germany's official policy towards America & Britain wasn't very sympathetic at the time (to say the least), Swing hangouts were routinely searched for by HJ's (""Hitler Junged"" - Hilter's Youths), Swing Kids were targeted by them, and Swing music was hard to find.The movie's three main characters are caught in the struggle between Swing music and the pressureto join the HJ's. Arvid, who is partially paralized, and is therefore 'unacceptable' by the Nazis, is a rabid Swing fan (which a large part of is a rebellion against the people who won't accept him). Peter is struggling with his father's 'disappearance' (he was taken by the Nazis a few years before the events of the movie). Thomas is just looking for acceptance, which he doesn't seem to get from his family or friends, so he willingly turns into a HJ - just to satisfy his need. The friends split up, turn against each other, and each goes towards his tragic end.The story in itself is predictable, but since the performances of the actors are quite good, and the period and subject matter of the films are not your obvious WW2 movies, it is a very enjoyable one (even just for knowldge's sake).",4,Interesting historical subject,1065916800,"10 12, 2003",2003,1330,"['movie', 'new', 'angle', 'Pre', 'WW2', 'German', 'society', 'title', ""'Swing"", 'Kids', 'are', 'German', 'youngsters', 'who', 'were', 'interested', 'British', 'American', 'slag', 'fashions', 'Germany', 'official', 'policy', 'towards', 'America', 'Britain', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'sympathetic', 'time', 'say', 'least', 'Swing', 'hangouts', 'were', 'routinely', 'searched', 'HJ', 'Hitler', 'Junged', 'Hilter', 'Youths', 'Swing', 'Kids', 'were', 'targeted', 'Swing', 'music', 'was', 'hard', 'find.The', 'movie', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'caught', 'struggle', 'Swing', 'music', 'pressureto', 'HJ', 'Arvid', 'who', 'partially', 'paralized', 'therefore', ""'unacceptable"", 'Nazis', 'rabid', 'Swing', 'fan', 'large', 'part', 'rebellion', 'people', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'accept', 'Peter', 'struggling', 'father', ""'disappearance"", 'was', 'taken', 'Nazis', 'few', 'years', 'events', 'movie', 'Thomas', 'just', 'looking', 'acceptance', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'family', 'friends', 'willingly', 'HJ', 'just', 'satisfy', 'need', 'friends', 'split', 'up', 'turn', 'other', 'tragic', 'end.The', 'story', 'predictable', 'performances', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'period', 'subject', 'matter', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'obvious', 'WW2', 'movies', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'even', 'just', 'knowldge', 'sake']",N/A

Whereas the scenes shot on th dance floor were pretty good, the tone of the movie was dark, sad and depressing. BUT - that's Germany in the 1940's, so that's really no surprise. It was an awful time to live. So, if you're looking for a fun movie like Christian Bale's other dance movie ""Newsies,"" this is a FAR FAR cry from that lighthearted musical.Some may like to be aware...- there is a shot where the young men goggle and comment lewdly on two photos of very shirtless women. The photos are shown.- the three men urinate against a Hitler poster. You see streams of urine, but body parts are hidden behind coats.- a large handful of langued, including the f***.- on the dance floor, copious amounts of girl's underwear is shown, whether it's form-fitting or loose baggy style undies. It's almost disturbing.- some of the dance moves themselves seem somewhat suggestive, as hands and bodies get in close proximity to private areas due to the dance movies. One woman shakes her torso vigorously to cheers from the croud.- the boys talk about finding a prostitue but decided not to to avoid the cost.- other crude/lewd comments sprinkled throughout the film.- a boy kills himself in a bathtub.

The movie focuses on the Swing Kids movement in Germany during WWII.  In the late 1930s some of the youth were wild about British Fashion and American Popular music of the day, which was of course swing.  As in Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, and you name it.  Hitler was opposed to this style of music as he saw it as a threat to the superior German culture.  So he tries to stifle the movement which makes it a rebel notion that appeals to the young even more.  Although, not without danger as it turns out.  While the movie focuses on three friends who are Swing Kids, through their stories we end up seeing the conflict between their Hilter Youth training and the fun Swing Dancing Era.  In the end, we learn that a lot of them were sent to harsh work camps.  And their families very worried about their fate.  The dancing in and of itself in the movie is awkwardly done.

For me, this was a huge disappointment. In the first place, I disliked the TV quality of the piece from first to last; it had that cheap TV look. The acting, the polished sets, the just-right costumes. The film lacked the look of the real which is no doubt more expensive than having everybody look like characters out of ""Cabaret."" Secondly, I objected immediately to the holier than thou, smug Hollywood teenagers playing ""ET Goes Nazi."" They had they upbeat, Walt Disney style of acting that one associates with ""Pollyanna."" The writing sets the pace, so each scene ends on a high note, with the good boys walking away from their skirmishes with the Nazis, always looking smarter and stronger. This is, of course, the central premise of the film, namely, that a bunch of eager, idealistic kids out of central-casting would have been able to defeat the Nazis in no time. ""Let Me at 'em,"" is the war-cry, sounding like Jimmie Cagney all the way. The premise offends my sense of how things are. I don't believe hip, cool kids line up on the left side against the forces of evil, that kids who defy the teacher grow up to be good and just, that teenagers make heroes. Nothing in life suggests that cultural misfits make politically brave citizens who lead the way against fascism or the right or anything else for that matter. The kids in this film fell into line, made good Nazis, died in the war, committed evil acts, and they liked Benny Goodman, just like the kids at Abu Ghraib listened to rock or rap as they tortured and humiliated their prisoners. Good taste in music doesn't lead to moral intelligence. Hollywood is very proud of itself and makes movie after movie about being on the right side of history and having good taste.

337019,A3E4P0QU692GN6,6302805392,"Parker Benchley ""Edward Garea""","[44, 58]","When I first saw the trailer for this film years ago, I thought to myself that this had to be the most preposterous subject for a movie. Imagine: all singing, all dancing, all Hitler. As a fan of bad movies I resolved to see this as soon as it hit my local cinema. Unfortunately, it missed my theater completely, as well as a lot of others, because the flick died after two weeks or so of release. Apparently, a lot of other people had the much the same reaction to that trailer, only they were more frugal with their money than I was willing to be.It wasn't until I saw the film on cable that I realized it was not nearly so bad as the trailer suggested. ""Swing Kids"" is actually based on a little known footnote to history. It has always been assumed that in Nazi Germany everyone thought and acted as one. Not so, especially among the youth. While the Hitler Youth was still the state-approved organization, it had lost its appeal, becoming seen as part of an establishment that allowed no channel for rebellion.Youth rebellion in Germany, as in the United States, was by no means monolithic. In the working-class sections of Dusseldorf, Cologne and Leipzig, gangs such as the Edelweiss Pirates ruled the streets, fighting the authorities and preying on the Hitler Youth (who themselves were bullies, but could not be touched by law enforcement). In the middle and upper class neighborhoods of Hamburg, resistance took the form of English-style dress and an addiction to American swing music. Known as ""Swingjugend,"" they were just as annoying to the authorities as the Edelweiss Pirates, though nowhere near as dangerous. (In 1944 the Pirates murdered the Gestapo chief of Cologne.) By the time war broke out in 1939, most swing kids were either in the HJ or labor camps.Unfortunately, ""Swing Kids"" gets off to a bad start by barely mentioning its subject in a 30-second preamble before getting into the plot itself, which concerns the friendship of three devotees of swing music, Peter (Robert Sean Leonard), Thomas (Christian Bale) and Arvid (Frank Whaley). We learn, quickly, that Peter's father was hauled off by the State for being a dissident, and that Arvid is also an outcast because he is clubfooted, and therefore a cripple in the eyes of society. (Ironic, in that Goebbels was also clubfooted)Thomas is a lost soul, caught up only in the friendship of Peter and the music.Caught by the police for a stupid prank, Peter is rescued by his friendly local Gestapo Agent (a brilliant turn by Kenneth Branaugh, who, for some reason (?), had his name removed from the credits. Hmmm.)and forced into the Hitler Youth. There he is joined by Thomas, who will not see his friend suffer alone. But as time goes on, Thomas is more and more taken in by the trappings of the Hitler Youth and what they offer: acceptance, which he does not get at home. There is no such respite for Arvid, who, as the film progresses, becomes ever more morose and alienated, choosing suicide before the authorites get to do it for him.The ending is not only predictable, but also cloying, with Peter relapsing back into his former life. As he is taken away by the authorities, younger brother Willy grabs Peter's umbrella and pledges alliegence towards all things Swing with an  obligatory ""Swing Heil!"" Branaugh denounces his former project as a case of misspent passion and we can well say this of the movie as a whole. Too many opportunities are missed and we are left with the feeling that perhaps this would have worked better as a documentary (there were swing kids in pre-war Japan also). This was a movie designed to take advantage of Christian Bale, who lit up the screen in Disney's previous ""Newsies,"" but the ambiguous script and plodding direction let eveyone down and make this, like ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" a movie best enjoyed on cable or DVD. And at the price of the DVD it is well worth it, if only for the performances of Branaugh and Bale.Besides, if you already own ""the Producers,"" what could be more interesting than to have the two musicals based on Nazi Germany?",3,Swingtime for Hitler,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,4070,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'myself', 'had', 'be', 'most', 'preposterous', 'subject', 'movie', 'Imagine', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Hitler', 'fan', 'bad', 'movies', 'resolved', 'see', 'as', 'soon', 'hit', 'local', 'cinema', 'Unfortunately', 'missed', 'theater', 'completely', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'others', 'flick', 'died', 'two', 'weeks', 'so', 'release', 'Apparently', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'had', 'much', 'same', 'reaction', 'trailer', 'only', 'were', 'more', 'frugal', 'money', 'was', 'willing', 'be.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'saw', 'film', 'cable', 'realized', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'bad', 'trailer', 'suggested', 'Swing', 'Kids', 'actually', 'based', 'little', 'known', 'footnote', 'history', 'always', 'been', 'assumed', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'everyone', 'thought', 'acted', 'one', 'Not', 'so', 'especially', 'youth', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'was', 'still', 'state-approved', 'organization', 'had', 'lost', 'appeal', 'becoming', 'seen', 'part', 'establishment', 'allowed', 'channel', 'rebellion.Youth', 'rebellion', 'Germany', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'means', 'monolithic', 'working-class', 'sections', 'Dusseldorf', 'Cologne', 'Leipzig', 'gangs', 'such', 'Edelweiss', 'Pirates', 'ruled', 'streets', 'fighting', 'authorities', 'preying', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'who', 'were', 'bullies', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'touched', 'law', 'enforcement', 'middle', 'upper', 'class', 'neighborhoods', 'Hamburg', 'resistance', 'took', 'form', 'English-style', 'dress', 'addiction', 'American', 'swing', 'music', 'Known', 'Swingjugend', 'were', 'just', 'annoying', 'authorities', 'Edelweiss', 'Pirates', 'nowhere', 'dangerous', '1944', 'Pirates', 'murdered', 'Gestapo', 'chief', 'Cologne', 'time', 'war', 'broke', 'out', '1939', 'most', 'swing', 'kids', 'were', 'either', 'HJ', 'labor', 'camps.Unfortunately', 'Swing', 'Kids', 'off', 'bad', 'start', 'barely', 'mentioning', 'subject', '30-second', 'preamble', 'getting', 'plot', 'friendship', 'three', 'devotees', 'swing', 'music', 'Peter', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'Thomas', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Arvid', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'learn', 'quickly', 'Peter', 'father', 'was', 'hauled', 'off', 'State', 'being', 'dissident', 'Arvid', 'also', 'outcast', 'clubfooted', 'therefore', 'cripple', 'eyes', 'society', 'Ironic', 'Goebbels', 'was', 'also', 'clubfooted', 'Thomas', 'lost', 'soul', 'caught', 'up', 'only', 'friendship', 'Peter', 'music.Caught', 'police', 'stupid', 'prank', 'Peter', 'rescued', 'friendly', 'local', 'Gestapo', 'Agent', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'who', 'reason', 'had', 'name', 'removed', 'credits', 'Hmmm', 'forced', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'joined', 'Thomas', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'friend', 'suffer', 'alone', 'time', 'Thomas', 'more', 'more', 'taken', 'trappings', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'what', 'offer', 'acceptance', 'not', 'get', 'home', 'such', 'respite', 'Arvid', 'who', 'film', 'ever', 'more', 'morose', 'alienated', 'choosing', 'suicide', 'authorites', 'get', 'do', 'him.The', 'ending', 'not', 'only', 'predictable', 'also', 'cloying', 'Peter', 'relapsing', 'back', 'former', 'life', 'taken', 'away', 'authorities', 'younger', 'brother', 'Willy', 'grabs', 'Peter', 'umbrella', 'pledges', 'alliegence', 'things', 'Swing', 'obligatory', 'Swing', 'Heil', 'denounces', 'former', 'project', 'case', 'misspent', 'passion', 'can', 'well', 'say', 'movie', 'whole', 'Too', 'many', 'opportunities', 'are', 'missed', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'documentary', 'were', 'swing', 'kids', 'pre-war', 'Japan', 'also', 'was', 'movie', 'designed', 'take', 'advantage', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'lit', 'up', 'screen', 'Disney', 'previous', 'Newsies', 'ambiguous', 'script', 'plodding', 'direction', 'let', 'eveyone', 'down', 'make', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', 'movie', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'cable', 'DVD', 'price', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'only', 'performances', 'Branaugh', 'Bale.Besides', 'already', 'own', 'Producers', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'have', 'two', 'musicals', 'based', 'Nazi', 'Germany']",N/A

337025,A2GJ98824GGXGP,6302805392,Timothy Kearney,"[1, 1]","The film SWING KIDS has a familiar setting: Nazi Germany but it tells a story that most people, at least most Americans, may not know. In 1939, Swing music was sweeping the world as Germany was continuing to invade its neighbors, and Germany was just as caught up with the popular form of music as any other country. The problem? The music was banned in Germany because it was not of German origin and due to the fact that many of the performers were of Jewish origin. The music became more than just a means of enjoyment for many German youth. It was also a form of rebellion and this is where the story begins.Robert Sean Leonard plays Peter, a young man who is struggling with the loss of his father as well as his hatred for the Nazis. He has avoided joining the Hitler Youth to this point, but knows he will soon have to make a choice. Most of his time is spent with his friends Thomas (Christian Bale) and Arvid (Frank Whaley) and their life revolves around collecting swing recordings, learning swing's lingo, and dancing. Tension begins when Peter and Thomas steal a radio as a prank and in order to avoid being sent to a work camp, decide to join the Hitler Youth and the remainder of the film deals with the choices these two have made and how it has an effect on the people closest to Peter and Thomas.The film does have an American feel to it, which may put it at a bit of a disadvantage as far as having an authentic feel is concerned, but it's strengths make it worthwhile. Peter is struggling, wanting to make different choices but also knowing he may not have too many options. We feel for him as he struggles with the realities of his day and feel his resentment at his mother's boyfriend who is a Nazi sympathizer but also tries to take the role of his father. We see Thomas change from a rebel to Nazi supporter but we see his change may be less a conversion to a cause and more of a form of parental rebellion. Likewise, we're not certain that Arvid hates the Nazis because of their ideology or because his disability would never allow him to join. Because the characters are multidimensional, the struggles and fights seem realistic and this alone keeps us interested in the film.One final note. While the story is paramount, the film has another advantage. The swing dancing is phenomenal. The people in the clubs are not casual dancers. They know swing and they dance with life and vigor. The intensity of the dancing also helps viewers see how people can rebel when there's no other way to do so.",4,An Interesting Story of Rebellion and Divided Loyalties,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,2520,"['film', 'SWING', 'KIDS', 'familiar', 'setting', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'story', 'most', 'people', 'least', 'most', 'Americans', 'may', 'not', 'know', '1939', 'Swing', 'music', 'was', 'sweeping', 'world', 'Germany', 'was', 'continuing', 'invade', 'neighbors', 'Germany', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'caught', 'up', 'popular', 'form', 'music', 'other', 'country', 'problem', 'music', 'was', 'banned', 'Germany', 'was', 'not', 'German', 'origin', 'due', 'fact', 'many', 'performers', 'were', 'Jewish', 'origin', 'music', 'became', 'more', 'just', 'means', 'enjoyment', 'many', 'German', 'youth', 'was', 'also', 'form', 'rebellion', 'where', 'story', 'begins.Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'Peter', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'struggling', 'loss', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'hatred', 'Nazis', 'avoided', 'joining', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'point', 'will', 'soon', 'have', 'make', 'choice', 'Most', 'time', 'spent', 'friends', 'Thomas', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Arvid', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'life', 'collecting', 'swing', 'recordings', 'learning', 'swing', 'lingo', 'dancing', 'Tension', 'when', 'Peter', 'Thomas', 'steal', 'radio', 'prank', 'order', 'avoid', 'being', 'sent', 'work', 'camp', 'decide', 'join', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'remainder', 'film', 'deals', 'choices', 'two', 'have', 'made', 'how', 'effect', 'people', 'closest', 'Peter', 'Thomas.The', 'film', 'have', 'American', 'feel', 'may', 'put', 'bit', 'disadvantage', 'as', 'far', 'having', 'authentic', 'feel', 'concerned', 'strengths', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'Peter', 'struggling', 'wanting', 'make', 'different', 'choices', 'also', 'knowing', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'options', 'feel', 'realities', 'day', 'feel', 'resentment', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'Nazi', 'sympathizer', 'also', 'take', 'role', 'father', 'see', 'Thomas', 'change', 'rebel', 'Nazi', 'supporter', 'see', 'change', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'conversion', 'cause', 'more', 'form', 'parental', 'rebellion', 'Likewise', ""'re"", 'not', 'certain', 'Arvid', 'Nazis', 'ideology', 'disability', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'join', 'characters', 'are', 'multidimensional', 'struggles', 'fights', 'seem', 'realistic', 'alone', 'interested', 'film.One', 'final', 'note', 'story', 'paramount', 'film', 'advantage', 'swing', 'dancing', 'phenomenal', 'people', 'clubs', 'are', 'not', 'casual', 'dancers', 'know', 'swing', 'dance', 'life', 'vigor', 'intensity', 'dancing', 'also', 'viewers', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'rebel', 'when', 'other', 'way', 'do', 'so']",N/A

Almost anyone who has any interest in History or World War 2 know of the Hitler Youth that actually took the place of the Boy Scouts in Nazi Germany. I dare say that few people know about those brave young people that chose to resist and be different at great personal risk and reject the Nazi Creed while following their first love...Swing Music. This Film solidly brings their story to the screen in a dramatic and heartwarming way. The cast in very good and bring the movie off very well. The only drawback to the film is that the actors speak their lines in perfect English. English spoken with a German accent would have added somewhat for those purists among us.
