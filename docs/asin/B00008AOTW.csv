Daniel was talking to his mother, but Robert was still trying to keep the sexual agenda going. He was un-buttoning his shirt and kissing his neck and stomach.

It was cute, and I didn't mind the production values or performances at all, and the sex scenes were very sweet and sexy, but at a more intellectual level this seemed to promise so much only to then fail to deliver.  This would be ok were it not for the fact that the hype around this seems to present it as some sort of exploration of White/Asian interactions in the gay community.  Given how non-white guys are oft viewed (if we are recognized at all) as trophies among some in the gay community (speaking as as a non-white gay guy), if we are willing to play out certain stereotypes, I assumed this would be quite a provocative theme to explore.

But it's entertaining and fun, and maybe hits a few chords just a little too close to home.Daniel, the perfect Asian son, lives with his widowed mom and his grandmother in San Francisco, as filial Asian boys tend to be expected to. Also in the vein of the perfect son, he can't come out to his family, and his mom relentlessly keeps trying to set him up with women.The family rents out the downstairs room, however, and a cute boarder (Robert) shows up to take the place. Sure enough, the two slowly but surely get together....This movie is not totally about Daniel and Robert's budding romance.  Well, it is, but there's more to it than that.  The magic of the movie is the family's reaction, Daniel's newfound priorities, and how Robert's unassuming yet formidable role in each. It's the standard stuff the coming-out flicks are made of, but hey, it always manages to tug at the heartstrings, right? We've all been there before, or know someone who has.... or at least we all know how difficult it is to stand up against unreasonable expectations.So yeah, everything about this DVD just screamed ""so-so""... but it's still worth a viewing.

Daniel is really a cute guy, a little nerdy, a lot sweet; such sweetness is well matched into Robert, country boy who moves to big city and rent a room from Daniel's mother. If being gay and in the closet while living with your mother was possible until then, now Daniel has temptation under the same roof, a temptation that is more than willing to help Daniel out of the closet. I liked the romantic feeling of the movie, and also that basically it remained light: Robert's relationship with his own family is good, and his own mother knows about her son's homosexuality and is supporting; but also Daniel, when it will be the time, will not have so much trouble, that is since, in the end, both mothers love deeply their sons. One thing I didn't understand, but in the end it was more funny than anything else, is the free nakedness all over the movie: not only Daniel, but also a lot of supporting characters were not shy with their naked flesh... as I said, since it was done with a litght tone, it was more funny than sexy.",5,Under One Roof (2002) directed by Todd Wilson,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,1150,"['idea', 'good', 'realization', 'maybe', 'little', 'low', 'budget', 'least', 'romance', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'preserved', 'Daniel', 'really', 'cute', 'guy', 'little', 'nerdy', 'lot', 'sweet', 'such', 'sweetness', 'well', 'matched', 'Robert', 'country', 'boy', 'who', 'big', 'city', 'rent', 'room', 'Daniel', 'mother', 'being', 'gay', 'closet', 'living', 'mother', 'was', 'possible', 'then', 'now', 'Daniel', 'temptation', 'same', 'roof', 'temptation', 'more', 'willing', 'help', 'Daniel', 'closet', 'liked', 'romantic', 'feeling', 'movie', 'also', 'basically', 'remained', 'light', 'Robert', 'relationship', 'own', 'family', 'good', 'own', 'mother', 'son', 'homosexuality', 'supporting', 'also', 'Daniel', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'end', 'mothers', 'love', 'deeply', 'sons', 'One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'end', 'was', 'more', 'funny', 'anything', 'else', 'free', 'nakedness', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'Daniel', 'also', 'lot', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'shy', 'naked', 'flesh', 'said', 'was', 'done', 'litght', 'tone', 'was', 'more', 'funny', 'sexy']",Under One Roof

That's exactly what we have in this movie. Under One Roof was directed by Todd Wilson. An Asian American family rents their downstairs to a gay male (Robert). When a pipe bursts within the first weeks of him moving in the mother decides it wold be okay if her son (Daniel) can share his bedroom with him. Things get complicated as they must acknowledge the feelings they have for each other and getting around Daniels mother.Plot RatingWe've seen this plot before so it's nothing to write home about. There have been other movies that have executed, such as, Mambo Italiano. I'm not tired per-say of all the stereotypical gay movies but the good thing going for this movie is that it didn't rely on hot guys, too much sex, or ass hots to keep the story going. It stays true to it's plot and creates a nice story. Plus, Jay Wong is rather adorable in this film. For this reason the plot gets a 6 out of 10.Actors/ActressesJay Wong is the closeted Asian boy who wants to please his mother rather than be happy. This movie is the only thing he's done and it's a shame because he was rather convincing as a struggling guy. I would like to see him in more things but I don't know how far his acting abilities really goes. I think I'm biased because he cute. James Marks plays Robert and there isn't much to this character. It's merely to play a love interest for the main character. His development isn't necessary but he has a very accepting mother. I guess you could say he acted alright in this film, nothing really to complain about or praise. They get a 6 out of 10, only because Wong carried the film.DVD ExtrasWe've got another TLA releasing film and it's some some stuff on it. There are outtakes that aren't funny but interesting to see how the cast interacted with each other and they seemed to have a pretty good time while filming the movie. There's a trailer for another film and we also have a commentary which is always cool to have. I'm a stickler for interviews though and this DVD tacks in that so I'm only going to give it a 5 out of 10.Personal ThoughtsI found this movie enjoyable but it's no brokeback mountain and let's be frank here, it didn't have half the budget that movie had. It does a convincing job at showing a young boy trying to find happiness between love and his family though.I recommend this movie to first time gay film watchers or hardcore fans of gay film.

Under One Roof has none of the qualities that makes a movie, not only a hit, but at least interesting enough to watch all the way through. I had to force myself awake through endless minutes of idiocy where I just thought- what is the big deal. It seems to me that the movie focused on how the love between two mean was so hidden for the danger it would impose on the two of them. Honostly, how long does it take for two gay men who attracted to each other and to realize the attraction. Apparantly it takes the never ending length of the movie. Perhaps it should be titled ""The Tale Under One Roof That Never Ends"". My recommendation is to save your money and buy something else. If you are looking for a type of move that identifies impossible attractions then I recommend The Trip, or Maurice.",1,No Hollywood Hit Here,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,902,"['are', 'looking', 'story', 'line', 'good', 'acting', 'secrecy', 'suspense', 'unsuspecting', 'love', 'then', 'buy', 'Maurice', 'One', 'Roof', 'none', 'qualities', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'hit', 'least', 'interesting', 'enough', 'watch', 'way', 'had', 'force', 'awake', 'endless', 'minutes', 'idiocy', 'where', 'just', 'thought-', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'movie', 'focused', 'how', 'love', 'two', 'mean', 'was', 'so', 'hidden', 'danger', 'would', 'impose', 'two', 'Honostly', 'how', 'long', 'take', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'attracted', 'other', 'realize', 'attraction', 'Apparantly', 'never', 'ending', 'length', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'titled', 'Tale', 'One', 'Roof', 'Never', 'Ends', 'recommendation', 'save', 'money', 'buy', 'something', 'else', 'are', 'looking', 'type', 'move', 'impossible', 'attractions', 'then', 'recommend', 'Trip', 'Maurice']",Under One Roof

It is almost like a watching a documentary about a young man reaching a crossroads in his life and nearly botching it, simply because he has never been at such a crossroads before.  I know the acting is not refined.  While I was watching the film I came to believe the two actors were lovers before they started filming, reliving what had happened to them in real life.  Of course, they weren't.  I forgot they were acting.  The script doesn't sound like a script.  It sounds like real people talking.  This is the way two fairly vanilla people of whatever gender do fall in love.  Seems to me something so true to life can't be bad.  Another reviewer came down hard on the woman playing the young man's mother.  She sounded to me precisely like Chinese-American women of her age I have heard on the street in NY or San Francisco.  They don't speak English with the same intonation as Tom Brokaw.  Yes, the ending is predictable, or is it? No one in the film comes down with AIDS.  Now isn't that a switch?  It is simply a typical love story with the young people in conflict with a traditional parent.  It's almost, ""oh, by the way, the two protagonists happen to be of the same gender"".  That's its strength, taking a predictable story, dropping two guys instead of a guy and girl into it, and acting like it is the most natural sort of film in the world.",5,Authentic,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,1469,"['Yes', 'low', 'budget', 'Yes', 'not', 'refined', 'precisely', 'what', 'movie', 'special', 'believable', 'almost', 'watching', 'documentary', 'young', 'man', 'reaching', 'crossroads', 'life', 'nearly', 'botching', 'simply', 'never', 'been', 'such', 'crossroads', 'know', 'acting', 'not', 'refined', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'came', 'believe', 'two', 'actors', 'were', 'lovers', 'started', 'filming', 'reliving', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'course', 'were', ""n't"", 'forgot', 'were', 'acting', 'script', ""n't"", 'sound', 'script', 'real', 'people', 'talking', 'way', 'two', 'fairly', 'vanilla', 'people', 'gender', 'do', 'fall', 'love', 'something', 'so', 'true', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'reviewer', 'came', 'down', 'hard', 'woman', 'playing', 'young', 'man', 'mother', 'sounded', 'precisely', 'Chinese-American', 'women', 'age', 'have', 'heard', 'street', 'NY', 'San', 'Francisco', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'same', 'intonation', 'Tom', 'Brokaw', 'Yes', 'ending', 'predictable', 'one', 'film', 'down', 'AIDS', 'Now', ""n't"", 'switch', 'simply', 'typical', 'love', 'story', 'young', 'people', 'conflict', 'traditional', 'parent', 'almost', 'oh', 'way', 'two', 'protagonists', 'happen', 'be', 'same', 'gender', 'strength', 'taking', 'predictable', 'story', 'dropping', 'two', 'guys', 'instead', 'guy', 'girl', 'acting', 'most', 'natural', 'sort', 'film', 'world']",Under One Roof
