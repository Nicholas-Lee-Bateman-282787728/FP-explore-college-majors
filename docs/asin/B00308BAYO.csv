It's different from any Jillian Michaels or Jackie Warner dvd you will do. Overall this is a great ab and leg workout that did leave me feeling a bit sore the next day without the high impact and high intensity work. It's great to have on hand for days I feel like I should work out but don't have a lot of ambition for Jillian Michaels.,5,Core and Curves,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,461,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', ""'d"", 'think', 'dvd', 'when', 'ordered', '4', 'band', 'included', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'different', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Jackie', 'Warner', 'dvd', 'will', 'do', 'Overall', 'great', 'ab', 'leg', 'workout', 'did', 'leave', 'feeling', 'bit', 'next', 'day', 'high', 'impact', 'high', 'intensity', 'work', 'great', 'have', 'hand', 'days', 'feel', 'should', 'work', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'ambition', 'Jillian', 'Michaels']",Marisa Tomei: Core & Curves

But I fell in love with this workout!The video is very well shot, and Marisa and her trainer are so low key and relaxed. Their instructions are kept to a minimum and the unobtrusive music helps you keep your focus--something you'll definitely need during the many moves that require you to balance on one leg. I sprained my knee a few months ago and ever since, my vastus medialis (the muscle behind the kneecap) has been achy and prone to catching. Leg lifts at the gym were  Well, many of the exercises strengthen the quads and the muscle directly above the kneecap, and even though my VM is still sore the stiffness has been greatly alleviated.The cardio bursts are short (30-60 sec) but they keep your heart rate up enough to make everything else just a little bit more challenging. I did all three workouts in a row and was sweating, but not exhausted. Several of the moves combine stretching with toning, so even though I woke up sore the next day, I didn't feel stiff. I started out with Jillian Michaels Burn Fat Boost Metabolism & 30 Day Shred, but at my current level of fitness her programs are so intense that I can only do them once a week. This a great alternative, and I look forward to trying Marisa's HoopBand workout that's slated to come out in August!",5,Killer workout with a zen vibe,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,1445,"['ran', 'item', 'Target', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'great', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'major', 'selling', 'point', 'compared', 'similar', 'DVDs', 'was', 'included', 'toning', 'band', 'fell', 'love', 'workout', 'video', 'very', 'well', 'shot', 'Marisa', 'trainer', 'are', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'relaxed', 'instructions', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'unobtrusive', 'music', 'keep', 'focus', 'something', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'need', 'many', 'moves', 'require', 'balance', 'one', 'leg', 'sprained', 'knee', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'ever', 'vastus', 'medialis', 'muscle', 'kneecap', 'been', 'achy', 'prone', 'catching', 'Leg', 'gym', 'were', 'Well', 'many', 'exercises', 'strengthen', 'quads', 'muscle', 'directly', 'kneecap', 'even', 'VM', 'still', 'sore', 'stiffness', 'been', 'greatly', 'alleviated.The', 'cardio', 'bursts', 'are', 'short', '30-60', 'sec', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'enough', 'make', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'did', 'three', 'workouts', 'row', 'was', 'sweating', 'not', 'exhausted', 'Several', 'moves', 'combine', 'stretching', 'toning', 'so', 'even', 'woke', 'up', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'stiff', 'started', 'out', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Burn', 'Fat', 'Boost', 'Metabolism', '30', 'Day', 'Shred', 'current', 'level', 'fitness', 'programs', 'are', 'so', 'intense', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'once', 'week', 'great', 'alternative', 'look', 'forward', 'trying', 'Marisa', 'HoopBand', 'workout', 'slated', 'come', 'out', 'August']",Marisa Tomei: Core & Curves

1314859,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00308BAYO,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[3, 3]","I am a dedicated at-home exerciser who uses fitness videos on a daily basis; given this, I generally don't go for most celebrity and other more popular workout titles that are released.  However, I became interested in this DVD because I am trying to incorporate more resistance band work into my strength training, and the three routines on this video utilize a small, loop-style band.Although actress Marisa Tomei's name is on this video and she is featured performing the exercises, the instructor is actually personal trainer Key Son.  Key (who I discovered has a BS from Cornell University and a doctorate degree in sports medicine) is very soft-spoken and serious throughout this video, but he really does serve in a training role to Marisa, counting her repetitions, providing her with form cues, etc.  Marisa is more laid-back and jokey than Key, but she also defers to him, such as in asking him if she is performing the exercises correctly.The Main Menu of this DVD provides a brief (1.5 minutes) Introduction in which Key and Marisa introduce themselves and explain that the routines incorporate many exercises within a short period of time WITHOUT the use of weights.  They also note that Marisa prefers to do the exercises barefoot.  The Menu also listed the three individual workouts (described below) and has a Custom Workout option, which allows the use to select the workouts to be played in any order, playing the warm-up and cool-down stretches only once.  Finally, there is an Audio Setup option to play the workouts with instruction only or instruction plus music (default).There are three main workouts on this DVD:  Body Refined, The Best Legs, and Total Body in 10.  Each routine automatically plays a warm-up and a cool-down which feature Marisa alone, but these are individually chaptered and thus can be skipped.  For the 2-minute warm-up sequence, Marisa starts seated.  She moves right into stretching the muscles cold, first seated, and then with several additional standing stretches, including some bouncing (ballistic) movements).  Marisa instructions the 3-minute cool-down live.  She moves VERY quickly through the stretches, starting with lunging stretches for the inner thighs and hip flexors; she does hold the reclined stretches for the hamstrings just a bit longer.Each of the three main routines are described below.  Times given are for each workout WITHOUT the warm-up and cool-down.BODY REFINED (22 minutes)Marisa continue notes that this workout is ""just 20 minutes.""  It starts with floor touches, a sort of forward bend/deadlift with no weights (although Key has Marisa reach out further).  Next comes one of several ""speed and agility"" drills, this one skips to the side and back, performed twice--you will need a good amount of room in your workout space for these!  With the band just above the ankles, Key has Marisa perform a micro lunge, bending one knee forward just a bit to work the area just above the knee.  The speed and agility drill is repeated, and then the next move is a knee lift with the band again around the ankles.  The band remains around the ankles for a series of side band walks:  first with the toes pointed in, then with one foot stepping behind the other, then face forward walking on tip-toes.  The final move with the band is a bent over reach on the toes.  This is followed by a brief cardio interval of punching on one foot, and then it's down to the floor.  The first move is push-ups (on ankles is optional--Marisa does them this way due to a shoulder injury).  Next is traveling plank for shoulder stabilization.  The band is then placed around the wrists for pullovers.  Following this, the band goes back around the ankles for a long series of crunches:  50 standard crunches, 50 staggered crunches (25 per side), and 40 leg raises (second 20 with rotation).  Returning to a plank position, Key has Marisa perform 10 knee ins, and then 10 with a rotation.  Coming back to standing, the final exercise in this routine is a standing twist with the band around the ankles.THE BEST LEGS (18 minutes)This routine repeats many of the same exercises from the first workout, although oddly, without the band.  Key again has Marisa begin with a reach forward, this time single leg reached.  Next is a move that he calls an inverted hamstring stretch, which is basically a one leg hold (or airplane/warrior 3 from yoga), and then a knee hold, another balance on one leg.  The speed and agility drill that follows involves skips forward and back.  The micro lunge move is next, followed by BACKWARD skips.  This is followed by the one leg knee bend and then plank with a hamstring curl and pelvic raises (10 double, 10 single).  Finally, Key has Marisa come back to standing and add the band above her ankles for small leg raises, first to the front, then side, then back.  The same band walk series from the first workout is performed (i.e., toes in, one foot front/behind, forward on toes), and then a set of staggered reaches to the front on the toes concludes this workout.TOTAL BODY IN 10 (8.5 minutes)This streamlined routine incorporates moves from the first two workouts and is designed to be performed in a short amount of time.  The 10 moves are as follows: 1) diagonal reaches forward, 2) fast side steps (speed & agility), 3) single leg knee bend with rear leg extension, 4) moving wide jumps (speed & agility), 5) bent-over reach and pull (Key states that this is an upper body move, as you are doing sort of a row, but you are also performing sort of a deadlift), 6) bicycle crunches on floor, 7) band walks with toes in, 8) band walks with one foot forward/back, 9) band walks on toes, facing front, 10) standing rotations with band around ankles, moving arms from one waist to above opposite shoulder.Overall, these three routines are definitely more lower-body focused, but I didn't mind that.  They are also a bit repetitive, but I liked the option of having different workout lengths to choose from.  I also think that I can easily modify the exercises to make them even more challenge--for example, I could add the band in some places where it isn't used, and I could easily hold light hand weights for some of the movements.The only thing that I did NOT like about this DVD were the warm-up and cool-down segments that Marisa instructs alone.  I didn't have a problem with her instruction per se, but in the warm-up, she engages in cold stretching of the muscles, something that is generally frowned upon by most experts.  The cool-down is a bit better, but she simply does not hold the stretches long enough to offer much benefit (to be fair, I have this issue with most exercise video cool-downs).In the end, however, I found this DVD to be a pleasant surprise, and it will definitely have a place in my fitness routine.",4,Surprisingly unique and effective!,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,6817,"['am', 'dedicated',

1314860,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B00308BAYO,Colleen M. Schneider,"[8, 9]","I had been eyeing this dvd for a while before I purchased it, first looking at clips of the dvd and then deciding it looked like something I would like to throw into my rotation.There are many things I liked about this dvd.  Marisa Tomei is not some dolled up celeb in perfect make-up and hair in her brand new outfit exercising.  She looks like someone that actually exercises, she is not wearing a ton of make-up and is wearing clothes that I would wear to work-out.  I already felt a connection.  The dvd contains three work-outs, one for body definition, which I thought was the hardest, due to doing a gizillion (well maybe a little less than that)sit-ups that are made more difficult by also working your legs with the small toning band included in the dvd.  Many of the movements were small for the legs...Ha, I thought, I work out every day, this will do nothing.  Yeah, I thought that until the afternoon when I was trying to figure out why the muscles in my legs were a little sore....oh yeah, the tiny little exercises.  Hmmmm, who knew?  This section took 20 minutes.  The next section was Best Legs and was 15 minutes and you work your legs and posture.  Ten Moves in Ten is a quick sculpting segment doing 10 exercises in 10 minutes.  This section would be nice to throw in on days where you wanted a little toning but did some walking or another form of exercise or you just were very short on time.The instructor Key Son was very good, he is a calming, focused presence who points out the form and how it should look.  The cuing is excellent and he is great at describing what each exercise is targeting.The one drawback I saw was that I have a SMALL livingroom.  This means some of the exercises where you do the shufflesteps across the floor had to be modified so that I did more repetitions back and forth and same thing with the walking with the bands, I had to turn quicker because space was an issue.  As far as this making the dvd any less effective it doesn't, so I don't really consider that a huge deal.I would definitely seek out more dvd's that feature Marisa & Key Son.  Overall, this is a great toning dvd that can be done in separate segments as well as together if you don't mind a little repetition on some of the moves.",5,"easy to follow, effective, exercises for core and beyond....",1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,2253,"['had', 'been', 'eyeing', 'dvd', 'while', 'purchased', 'first', 'looking', 'clips', 'dvd', 'then', 'deciding', 'looked', 'something', 'would', 'like', 'throw', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'liked', 'dvd', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'not', 'dolled', 'up', 'celeb', 'perfect', 'make-up', 'hair', 'brand', 'new', 'outfit', 'exercising', 'someone', 'actually', 'not', 'wearing', 'ton', 'make-up', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'would', 'wear', 'work-out', 'already', 'felt', 'connection', 'dvd', 'three', 'work-outs', 'one', 'body', 'definition', 'thought', 'was', 'hardest', 'due', 'doing', 'gizillion', 'well', 'maybe', 'little', 'less', 'sit-ups', 'are', 'made', 'more', 'difficult', 'also', 'working', 'legs', 'small', 'toning', 'band', 'included', 'dvd', 'Many', 'movements', 'were', 'small', 'legs', 'Ha', 'thought', 'work', 'out', 'day', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'Yeah', 'thought', 'afternoon', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'muscles', 'legs', 'were', 'little', 'sore', '.oh', 'yeah', 'tiny', 'little', 'exercises', 'Hmmmm', 'who', 'knew', 'section', 'took', '20', 'minutes', 'next', 'section', 'was', 'Best', 'Legs', 'was', '15', 'minutes', 'work', 'legs', 'posture', 'Ten', 'Moves', 'Ten', 'quick', 'sculpting', 'segment', 'doing', '10', 'exercises', '10', 'minutes', 'section', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'throw', 'days', 'where', 'wanted', 'little', 'toning', 'did', 'walking', 'form', 'exercise', 'just', 'were', 'very', 'short', 'time.The', 'instructor', 'Key', 'Son', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'calming', 'focused', 'presence', 'who', 'out', 'form', 'how', 'should', 'look', 'cuing', 'excellent', 'great', 'describing', 'what', 'exercise', 'targeting.The', 'one', 'drawback', 'saw', 'was', 'have', 'SMALL', 'livingroom', 'exercises', 'where', 'do', 'shufflesteps', 'floor', 'had', 'be', 'modified', 'did', 'more', 'repetitions', 'back', 'forth', 'same', 'thing', 'walking', 'bands', 'had', 'turn', 'quicker', 'space', 'was', 'issue', 'As', 'far', 'making', 'dvd', 'less', 'effective', ""n't"", 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'consider', 'huge', 'deal.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'seek', 'out', 'more', 'dvd', 'feature', 'Marisa', 'Key', 'Son', 'Overall', 'great', 'toning', 'dvd', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'separate', 'segments', 'as', 'well', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'repetition', 'moves']",Marisa Tomei: Core & Curves

I read very good reviews, and come on, who wouldn't like to be as fit as Marisa Tomei?

But I have watched the entire dvd and saw the moves to the ab section in the workout and decided to give it a go on my own a couple of nights later (I remembered the exercises and used the toning band like she did). Let me tell you something, Marisa Tomei lied to me as she's lied to many I presume. The woman didn't even break a sweat, and so here I'm thinking, ""easy peasy!"" Boy was I wrong. I'm not new to ab exercises. I've done plenty in my day, but I could only bust out with a couple of hers. The ones with the twist, I was like well ok, that looks nice. I could barely do one correctly, and the twist motion is much harder to accomplish than it looks. The whole ab section took me by surprise. I wasn't expecting it to be murder. I did them without watching the video, so I gave up easily, but I have a thing where if I'm watching a video I have to follow through with it regardless of the pain. I almost died doing few I did (I haven't worked out in two weeks, I've been sick and sloth-ish) , I don't want to think about having to follow through with the whole section once I follow along to the video. I can imagine it's pure murder. I can't say what the rest of the workout is like, but I can say that the ab section alone is worth it. PLUS the toning band. I've found that using that for those ab exercises definitely amplifies the benefits of the exercises. It makes it that much more difficult, which is great because I don't like getting bored, especially with the ab exercises, I need to switch it up or my muscles get used to it and it stops working. ALSO, one note on the warm up to her workouts. She has three workouts, total body, legs and 10-min and the warm up is the same for all. I'm not a fan of her warm up. There's very little warming up, if any at all. She stretches her muscles, which I've read and heard on numerous occasions is something you shouldn't do. I don't mind because I always do my own warm-up anyway, but if you're someone who is new to exercising, you may want to be careful with her warm up and just do your own. I'm just voicing this based on what I've read, have been told by professionals, etc. If you feel otherwise, that's fine too. Anyway, I would recommend using her warm-up as a cool down/stretch (but also add extra stretching, it's very important to prevent injuries and hers is very short and not very thorough). Other than that, I'd say I love this video, even if it's just for the abs.Once I workout to the video in its entirety, I'll let you know what I think, add some comments or change the rating.",4,If you need just one reason to buy this,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,2660,"['Let', 'be', 'ab', 'section', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'much', 'entire', 'workout', 'dvd', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'have', 'watched', 'entire', 'dvd', 'saw', 'moves', 'ab', 'section', 'workout', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'own', 'couple', 'nights', 'later', 'remembered', 'exercises', 'used', 'toning', 'band', 'did', 'Let', 'tell', 'something', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'lied', 'lied', 'many', 'presume', 'woman', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'break', 'sweat', 'so', 'here', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'easy', 'peasy', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'new', 'ab', 'exercises', ""'ve"", 'done', 'plenty', 'day', 'could', 'only', 'bust', 'out', 'couple', 'hers', 'ones', 'twist', 'was', 'like', 'well', 'ok', 'nice', 'could', 'barely', 'do', 'one', 'correctly', 'twist', 'motion', 'much', 'harder', 'accomplish', 'whole', 'ab', 'section', 'took', 'surprise', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'be', 'murder', 'did', 'watching', 'video', 'gave', 'up', 'easily', 'have', 'thing', 'where', ""'m"", 'watching', 'video', 'have', 'follow', 'regardless', 'pain', 'almost', 'died', 'doing', 'few', 'did', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'out', 'two', 'weeks', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sick', 'sloth-ish', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'having', 'follow', 'whole', 'section', 'once', 'follow', 'along', 'video', 'can', 'imagine', 'pure', 'murder', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'rest', 'workout', 'can', 'say', 'ab', 'section', 'alone', 'toning', 'band', ""'ve"", 'found', 'using', 'ab', 'exercises', 'definitely', 'benefits', 'exercises', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'getting', 'bored', 'especially', 'ab', 'need', 'switch', 'up', 'muscles', 'get', 'used', 'working', 'ALSO', 'one', 'note', 'warm', 'up', 'workouts', 'three', 'workouts', 'total', 'body', 'legs', '10-min', 'warm', 'up', 'same', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'warm', 'up', 'very', 'little', 'warming', 'up', 'muscles', ""'ve"", 'read', 'heard', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'something', 'should', ""n't"", 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'always', 'do', 'own', 'warm-up', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'new', 'exercising', 'may', 'want', 'be', 'careful', 'warm', 'up', 'just', 'do', 'own', ""'m"", 'just', 'voicing', 'based', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'professionals', 'etc', 'feel', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'too', 'Anyway', 'would', 'recommend', 'using', 'warm-up', 'cool', 'down/stretch', 'also', 'add', 'extra', 'stretching', 'very', 'important', 'prevent', 'injuries', 'hers', 'very', 'short', 'not', 'very', 'thorough', 'Other', ""'d"", 'say', 'love', 'video', 'even', 'just', 'abs.Once', 'workout', 'video', 'entirety', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'add', 'comments', 'change', 'rating']",Marisa Tomei: Core & Curves
1314863,AZRBWJ5UFRJKV,B00308BAYO,Kathleen Gohn,"[4, 4]","The main goals of these workouts seem to be improving balance and toning leg muscles with high reps, especially the underworked ones, but there is also an intense ab routine. This makes for an original set of workouts with a lot of moves that I'd never seen before.However, there are several issues: the most glaring one is that Marisa's and Key's personalities don't blend well. Marisa tries to be upbeat and friendly (""I only have ten minutes to get to my party, Key""), but it seems awkward because Key usually ignores this and is always business-like. He also keeps trying to keep the pace and intensity up, while Marisa will occasionally stop for a small stretch. I don't mind either of these approaches, but they don't work well together. Fortunately, Marisa leads the short warm-up and cool-down by herself - but you should know that they are the same for all the workouts and her cueing needs some work. Some of the exercises and a lot of the pointers (""I try to focus on one spot to help with my balance"") are repeated, but this doesn't bother me too much. The abs are really only worked once, but yikes! It's 100 crunches with raised legs - too intense for me, not to mention boring. Also they don't ""flow seemlessly"" as the intro implies; the transitions aren't awkward, but gaiam shouldn't be marketing something just because it's in vogue.The big problems of the routines themselves are the ""speed and agility"" drills and the focus on the muscles right above the knee. There are at least 5 moves (all with rather high reps) devoted to this area. I understand that they are underworked muscles that most workouts ignore, but this is excessive. The cardio segments are way too short to be considered intervals, I think they are used to get the heart rate back up after using such small muscles groups. They also require a lot of space and sometimes you have to go backwards which can be dangerous in a small or messy room. I usually just do jumping jacks or jog in place, instead.Despite all my complaints, I do like this workout because although the muscles are worked intensely, the atmosphere is not intense at all, so I come out of it feeling very relaxed.",3,"Not a favorite, but still worth having",1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,2170,"['main', 'goals', 'workouts', 'seem', 'be', 'improving', 'balance', 'toning', 'leg', 'muscles', 'high', 'reps', 'especially', 'underworked', 'ones', 'also', 'intense', 'ab', 'routine', 'original', 'set', 'workouts', 'lot', 'moves', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'before.However', 'are', 'several', 'issues', 'most', 'glaring', 'one', 'Marisa', 'Key', 'personalities', 'do', ""n't"", 'blend', 'well', 'Marisa', 'be', 'upbeat', 'friendly', 'only', 'have', 'ten', 'minutes', 'get', 'party', 'Key', 'awkward', 'Key', 'usually', 'always', 'business-like', 'also', 'trying', 'keep', 'pace', 'intensity', 'up', 'Marisa', 'will', 'occasionally', 'stop', 'small', 'stretch', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'approaches', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'together', 'Fortunately', 'Marisa', 'short', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'should', 'know', 'are', 'same', 'workouts', 'cueing', 'work', 'exercises', 'lot', 'pointers', 'try', 'focus', 'one', 'spot', 'help', 'balance', 'are', 'repeated', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'abs', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'worked', 'once', 'yikes', '100', 'crunches', 'raised', 'legs', 'too', 'intense', 'not', 'mention', 'boring', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'seemlessly', 'intro', 'implies', 'transitions', 'are', ""n't"", 'awkward', 'gaiam', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'marketing', 'something', 'just', 'vogue.The', 'big', 'problems', 'routines', 'are', 'speed', 'agility', 'drills', 'focus', 'muscles', 'right', 'knee', 'are', 'least', '5', 'moves', 'rather', 'high', 'reps', 'devoted', 'area', 'understand', 'are', 'underworked', 'muscles', 'most', 'workouts', 'ignore', 'excessive', 'cardio', 'segments', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'be', 'considered', 'intervals', 'think', 'are', 'used', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'back', 'up', 'using', 'such', 'small', 'muscles', 'groups', 'also', 'require', 'lot', 'space', 'sometimes', 'have', 'go', 'backwards', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'small', 'messy', 'room', 'usually', 'just', 'do', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'jog', 'place', 'instead.Despite', 'complaints', 'do', 'workout', 'muscles', 'are', 'worked', 'intensely', 'atmosphere', 'not', 'intense', 'come', 'feeling', 'very', 'relaxed']",Marisa Tomei: Core & Curves

1314867,A231KSL42Z60CQ,B00308BAYO,Melissa McKenzie,"[12, 15]","While parts of the video are a little challenging, I have a few concerns.  The energy bursts (shuffles and whatnot) require a lot of room.  She uses a good portion of the empty room they are filming in and I just don't have that kind of room so I had to break it down into multiple trips across my living room floor instead of one each way.I spent years working in physical therapy and, unfortunately, have the beginning stages of carpal tunnel syndrome.  A portion of the ab section requires a fully extended plank position which is really hard on my wrists.  I have been able to modify and do the plank on my elbows but doing the exercises in that position eliminates some room and it becomes a little bit tricky. It is possible though so it's something for people who have wrist issues to consider trying if they want to purchase this DVD.I didn't really find any of the leg exercises to be all that challenging which was a slight disappointment and I was a little bummed that the exercises weren't previewed before she did them.  My favorite celebrity/trainer videos are the Cindy Crawford ones from well over a decade ago.  In those, she shows you what she's going to do before doing it.  I didn't have any problems figuring out what Marisa was doing, but in comparing it to what I already have, this DVD failed a little regarding that aspect.The band is a nice touch.  It's something that can be used with other videos and something that is always nice to have as part of any home gym, I just wish it was a tad bit longer.Marisa is easy to relate to and she has great form.  What's also nice is that you can hear that she is struggling just a little bit when she speaks, which is so much better than some of the other videos where people are super happy and not at all out of breath after doing the exercises.Overall, it's a pretty good video if you don't have any wrist issues, but because I do, I had to give it a 3/4.  It would have gotten a 4/5 if I was challenged more by the leg workouts or if I didn't have to modify the ab section at all.  People with lower back problems might have a few issues.  There is a lower ab/lower ab oblique section with leg raises and leg raises with twists that will probably cause LBP sufferers some pain so, again, modifications may need to be made for them to do the routines, but it can be done.",3,Good and bad...,1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,2342,"['parts', 'video', 'are', 'little', 'challenging', 'have', 'few', 'concerns', 'energy', 'bursts', 'shuffles', 'whatnot', 'require', 'lot', 'room', 'good', 'portion', 'empty', 'room', 'are', 'filming', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'room', 'had', 'break', 'down', 'multiple', 'trips', 'living', 'room', 'floor', 'instead', 'one', 'way.I', 'spent', 'years', 'working', 'physical', 'therapy', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'beginning', 'stages', 'carpal', 'tunnel', 'syndrome', 'portion', 'ab', 'section', 'fully', 'extended', 'plank', 'position', 'really', 'hard', 'wrists', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'modify', 'do', 'plank', 'elbows', 'doing', 'exercises', 'position', 'room', 'little', 'bit', 'tricky', 'possible', 'something', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'wrist', 'issues', 'consider', 'trying', 'want', 'purchase', 'DVD.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'leg', 'be', 'challenging', 'was', 'slight', 'disappointment', 'was', 'little', 'bummed', 'exercises', 'were', ""n't"", 'previewed', 'did', 'favorite', 'celebrity/trainer', 'videos', 'are', 'Cindy', 'Crawford', 'ones', 'well', 'decade', 'ago', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'doing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'Marisa', 'was', 'doing', 'comparing', 'what', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'failed', 'little', 'regarding', 'aspect.The', 'band', 'nice', 'touch', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'other', 'videos', 'something', 'always', 'nice', 'have', 'part', 'home', 'gym', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'tad', 'bit', 'longer.Marisa', 'easy', 'relate', 'great', 'form', 'What', 'also', 'nice', 'can', 'hear', 'struggling', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'videos', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'super', 'happy', 'not', 'breath', 'doing', 'exercises.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wrist', 'issues', 'do', 'had', 'give', '3/4', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', '4/5', 'was', 'challenged', 'more', 'leg', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'modify', 'ab', 'section', 'People', 'lower', 'back', 'problems', 'might', 'have', 'few', 'issues', 'lower', 'ab/lower', 'ab', 'oblique', 'section', 'leg', 'raises', 'leg', 'twists', 'will', 'probably', 'cause', 'LBP', 'sufferers', 'pain', 'so', 'again', 'modifications', 'may', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'do', 'routines', 'can', 'be', 'done']",Marisa Tomei: Core & Curves
