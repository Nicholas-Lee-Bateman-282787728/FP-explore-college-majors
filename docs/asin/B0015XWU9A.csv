Plots for Tots was the worst episode ever. The show was just not the same anymore. Every other season is great but season was not. I almost gave it a lower rating but there were a few good things about this season but not that much. I don't think I would buy it and anyway at some I'll be able to see it all on Youtube so everything works out fine.,3,Not my favorite season,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,479,"['love', 'show', 'where', 'show', 'got', 'bad', 'hated', 'Randy', 'left', 'was', 'favorite', 'Marty', 'kids', 'were', 'annoying', 'Plots', 'Tots', 'was', 'worst', 'episode', 'ever', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'anymore', 'Every', 'other', 'season', 'great', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'almost', 'gave', 'lower', 'rating', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'season', 'not', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'buy', 'anyway', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Youtube', 'everything', 'out', 'fine']",Home Improvement: Season 8

It's hard to believe that it's been nearly nine years since this show ended. I raised my kids on Home Improvement. It was a great family time show--not like the crap that airs on free t.v. today. There were family values, lots of laughter, and healthy relationships. It was about building bonds, building strong character, and laughter--lots of laughter.

1151491,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B0015XWU9A,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[0, 0]","How very pleasant to be reminded of all those excellent reasons for watching Tim Allen's ""Home Improvement"" series, of which this collection was the final season. Among said good reasons are to appreciate rather witty, character-focused writing, a focus on an intact, affectionate and reasonably well-adjusted family, the occasional hilarious physical pratfall... and I always rather liked the clever scene transitions. They were small, throw-away bits, but still. It said worlds about this show that such care and creativity were taken with such a relatively minor detail.Having said that, it was also a little jarring to see how much the boys had grown, from season one to season eight; but of course it was eight years. The bright eleven-year old and the father-adoring pre-schooler will have become respectively a college-freshman and a middle-school student by the end of it all. And I think they had worked out every possible and impossible means of hiding half of neighbor Wilson's face under every circumstance. But not Tim the Toolman's ability to demolish household appliances and gadgets of every description; that, like Wily Coyote's genius for creative destruction, was a well that never went dry, as proved in the bonus feature ""The Home Improvement Users' Guide"".  One sequence of that reunion special featured a series of exploding BBQ grills, souped-up dishwashers and revolving Christmas trees throwing off sparks and clouds of smoke... it was so hilarious we played it back a couple of times, laughing ourselves to tears each time. All in all, a series which has stood up very well, especially in comparison to the current crop of situation comedies on the broadcast networks.",5,That's a Wrap,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,1695,"['How', 'very', 'pleasant', 'be', 'reminded', 'excellent', 'reasons', 'watching', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'series', 'collection', 'was', 'final', 'season', 'said', 'good', 'reasons', 'are', 'appreciate', 'rather', 'witty', 'character-focused', 'writing', 'focus', 'intact', 'affectionate', 'reasonably', 'well-adjusted', 'family', 'occasional', 'hilarious', 'physical', 'pratfall', 'always', 'rather', 'liked', 'clever', 'scene', 'transitions', 'were', 'small', 'throw-away', 'bits', 'still', 'said', 'worlds', 'show', 'such', 'care', 'creativity', 'were', 'taken', 'such', 'relatively', 'minor', 'detail.Having', 'said', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'jarring', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'boys', 'had', 'grown', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'eight', 'course', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'bright', 'eleven-year', 'old', 'father-adoring', 'pre-schooler', 'will', 'have', 'become', 'respectively', 'college-freshman', 'middle-school', 'student', 'end', 'think', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'possible', 'impossible', 'means', 'hiding', 'half', 'neighbor', 'Wilson', 'face', 'circumstance', 'not', 'Tim', 'Toolman', 'ability', 'demolish', 'household', 'appliances', 'gadgets', 'description', 'Wily', 'Coyote', 'genius', 'creative', 'destruction', 'was', 'well', 'never', 'went', 'dry', 'proved', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'Users', 'Guide', 'One', 'sequence', 'reunion', 'special', 'featured', 'series', 'exploding', 'BBQ', 'grills', 'souped-up', 'dishwashers', 'revolving', 'Christmas', 'trees', 'throwing', 'off', 'sparks', 'clouds', 'smoke', 'was', 'so', 'hilarious', 'played', 'back', 'couple', 'times', 'laughing', 'tears', 'time', 'series', 'stood', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'comparison', 'current', 'crop', 'situation', 'comedies', 'broadcast', 'networks']",Home Improvement: Season 8

They really did justice to this series; by adding extras to the DVD sets and this volume is no different. It has blooper reels; and also includes the ""Backstage Pass"" episode that ran right after the series finale on ABC. I remember this because it showed Wilson's (Earl Hindman) entire face in the cast introductions after the series finale ended. During the series run in the cast intro's in front of the studio audience; Wilson would come out holding a small prop of a fence on the lower part of his face and as everyone knows this was a running gag throughout the series.It also includes the 2003 special; ""Tim Allen Presents: A Users Guide to Home Improvement"". I think I saw this on PBS a few years ago. It Has Tim, Al, Heidi and Rock (Casey Sander) in front of a live studio audience. Earl Hindman (Wilson) narrates the show; but is not seen except in film footage played throughout the show. It's live action and footage of funny moments throughout the series. But it's nice that they included it in this DVD set.So if you are looking for family oriented entertainment and have not bought this yet; go ahead and do so; it's a great set and a nice way to end this wonderful series.
