While the acting in this movie may not be stellar that doesn't take away from a portrayal of events and emotions that did or could have happened in Viet Nam.  This was a terrible war.  Young men were put in awful situations (the actors are much older than the actual soldiers).  Bad things happened, men did what they were trained to do, reacted to situations while under fire, were overwhelmed by events and emotions.  Flashbacks are real and terrible.  A huge number of homeless are Viet Nam vets still suffering from PTSD.

It was about ""brothers in war"" and about the horrors of the mess that was the Vietnamese War. It was also the intensely personal story of former vets returning to the country--as recorded by an attractive female photo-journalist--who had plenty of ""psych. baggage"" from those times, especially over their accidential mowing down of civilians, a bunch of the platooon mutinying against their C.O. (particularly in reaction to the captain's making a noise over the incident (damned commendable!), and how many were later casualties from artillery fire which they'd thought was the C.O.'s mistake (but did--in fact--have to do with another's mistake).As I understand it, this film provided a reasonable portrayal of what it was like for USMC forces ""in country"" in the sixties (with many flash-backs)--and the terrible anguish of these men, who were still--many years later--full of anger and plagued by dysfunction, who--eventually--came to enjoy some relief and healing from that nightmare. Plenty of heart here. And, I liked that this was not soley about ""war crimes,"" but focused on valuable ""military culture"" and brotherhood. These men took what I consider legitimate pride in their history as U.S. Marines. At the very end, as they are moving away from the captain, he belts out ""Marines!!""  A moment later--in fine military fashion, and in unison--they do an ""about face"" and salute their former C.O. This moment really got me--Esprit of the corps and comraderie!! Saying this kind of blows my mind, as an antiwar activist, but ""military culture"" does have some aspects to be admired.An excellent quote (by the captain): ""We all did our best in Vietnam, and everyone f***d up one way or another.""

As a matter of fact, I thought the movie portrayed the good and bad sides of American soldiers quite well.In one scene, the Americans are fighting the North Vietnamese and fire into a crowd of civilians to kill one. They kill everyone in the crowd, an action that warrants the men the disgust of their leader.The movie focuses on Ramsey, who fought in the war and whose men now hate him. There are many flashbacks, showing heroism and brutality. At the end, the reasons behind the men's hatred for Ramsey are revealed...and what really happened when the men were under friendly fire.There is a lot of swearing, so it is definitely not for children.

724683,A3JLKDUV0B6O5U,B000077VQJ,TFR,"[1, 3]","One of the worst war films, ever. Whoever wrote the script for this film was clearly not doing the Vietnam veteran any favors.There were just too many things wrong with ""Under Heavy Fire"", beginning with both the historical and  technical aspects of Marine combat operations in Vietnam.The first combat sequence is laughable.  Marine combat commanders didn't order Navy Skyraider pilots to drop their fuel tanks under any circumstances.  So is the use of an M113 as an NVA tank.  So is the staged movement of the ""troops"" under fire.At one point, the Hue City sequence looked pretty good, but it wasn't enough to give any depth to the story or develop any of the characters.  I didn't care what happened to anybody in the film, because it seemed to me that what they were doing from scene to scene was nonsensical.At the very least, the characters come across as stereotypical.  And what was the deal with the female lead?  What was she supposed to be about?The story plods along at an irritatingly slow pace. Predictably, by the film's end, the real villain is fleshed out and the inept Captain Ramsey character is vindicated.  He and Carrie Otis walk off into the sunset, holding hands.Anyway, if you liked this film, try to pick up a dvd set of the old Chuck Connors TV show, ""Branded"".At the beginning of each show, Chuck is stripped of all his medals by some fat midget general standing on a soap box, and then sent off on the road to oblivion, I guess back to the minors.  Pack duffle and shuffle, Chuck!I can still remember part of the ""Branded"" theme song:  ""All but one man died, there at Bitter Creek...  What can you do when you're branded... And you know you're a man?""  Taa Daa!""Branded"" might have been trite, but at least it wasn't pretentious and exploitive.

724684,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B000077VQJ,The Mysterious Traveler,"[3, 6]","UNDER HEAVY FIRE (2001) Directed by Sidney J. Furie.Starring Caspar Van Dien.A group of tortured, sobbing, mentally unstable Vietnam Vets return to sunny happy apparently Non-Communist Vietnam to relive the spring of 1968 supposedly to discover what really happened when it appeared their Captain ordered artillary fire on his own men but really so the filmmakers can trot out nearly all of the Commie/lib propaganda points about the War save, by some miracle, that the troops were not all suppressed homosexual nazis.  It starts out well but reveals its true Red identity at the 60 minute mark when an American college professor, wearing a Ho Chi Minh T-shirt, helpfully explains that the Vietcong were filled with love while the Americans were filled with hate. Really. I am not making it up.The Americans mow down innocent women and children. There are no communists in the film. No one knows what the war is about.  The South Vietnamese(whom the Reds slaughtered in 1975) are portrayed as being a bunch of savages so obviously deserved to be exterminated. The modern now South Vietnamese frei Vietnam is populated all with glowing smiling Elmos. The dirty sick Americans all end up in a muddy field screaming.A filthy piece of excrement that happily, due to the attack of the Muslim barbarians the year this was voided from the Liberal rectum, we will never see any more of since Hollywood needs the exact same poison to help undercut the troops fighting the 9/11 War.Like AVATAR, nice special effects, gorgeous photography and battle scenes.

724685,A3373I4II32NA1,B000077VQJ,Tyler,"[2, 2]","I know a lot of people didn't like this movie, but I just finished watching it and have to give my full, honest opinion on what this movie seems to be about from my point of view.The movie centers on two things--survivors from a Marine line company of which Marine Capt. Ramsey(Casper Van Dien)takes command and leads the men through several scenes. Everything from viewing the bodies of enemy troops who were killed in a B-52 strike, to the Battle of Hue during the Tet Offensive of '68, and to the fateful day in the rice paddies when several Marines obviously rebel against one of the captain's orders and march off unknowingly towards an NVA ambush, where the captain tries to call down artillery fire on the enemy in the treeline and several Americans die when the shells land on their own position instead. Ramsey is immediately blamed for this disaster, even though an inquiry doesn't feel the same way.The second point of the movie is several Vietnam vets of this company journey back to Vietnam in the present day under the camera lens of a documentary crew. They are still full of hate against their commander, who also shows up at the last minute at their ""orientation"" meeting. The men lash out at him during this movie right up to the point where when they see the rice paddies where the incident took place, each man goes through their own personal hell of reliving the tragedy that took place there in '68. Shots are even fired from one maniacal veteran as he pulls out a gun(how the hell did he manage to get that through airport security???)and fires off some shots that hit both the former Captain and the former Sergeant. One of the vets realizes that it was never Ramsey's fault, since he screwed up the coordinates himself for the artillery support instead of Ramsey, and he takes personal blame for this. It looks like the sergeant who got shot is a goner for a while, but those who are shot in this flashback episode all manage to survive.What I liked in the end is how before the men are going home, they all stop and salute their former Captain, having finally let go of their anger and have full respect for him after those 40-odd years.What I wondered about was why there was no police involvement from the Vietnamese government. Certainly if there's a bit of gunplay being displayed with a bunch of Vietnam vets going through their flashbacks, wouldn't they respond to this with at least an INVESTIGATION??? Or maybe because the only proof that something went down in those fields was simply on the tape of the video being shot by this, which the reporter claims with a smile ""the full hour of which was erased accidentally by a magnet."" But besides that, it was quite a movie. I liked the viewpoints of the veterans back from when they were serving in the war, and then when they're old men going back to Vietnam to confront their past once more.Don't know much why people hated this movie, but I give it 5 stars.

The plot revolves around a group of Marines returning to Vietnam to reexperience their old haunts of thirty years past. The group is hostile to their captain, who they belive called in an artillery strike on some of them, killing several, after a mutinous incident. As the men relive their experiences of the past war, they begin to confront what took place in the rice paddies long ago.The movie is bad in nearly every respect. The lead, Casper Van Dien, is woefully miscast (he was great in Starship Troopers) and his efforts to play a Marine captain and demonstrate ""decisiveness"" are ridiculous. van Diem as a meditative, tormented soul with a ""Marlboro gravelly"" voice?! Hysterical.Worse are the stereotypes of ""'Nam"" vets. After BG Burkett's Stolen Valor, it is amazing such idiotic stereotypes can still exist. Naturally the ""'Nam"" vets here are all given to constant ""confession,"" drunken reveling and psychotic behavior--brought on by ""'Nam,"" of course.In the tradition of Platoon, there is no mention of politics in the film--other than ""wise"" looking Vietnamese soberly declaring that they ""fought from the heart for liberation"" while the Americans merely ""fought from hate of the Gooks."" Maybe this is the reason the movie's American vets are constantly weeping and having existential crises that resemble what your kid-sister had when her boyfriend broke up w/ her. Anyway this is ""'Nam"" for MTV, not actual vets--so why not?The script is so bad that it's painful to listen to. Did this film have an editor?In short, the film is a remarkably amaturish attempt to cash in on ""'Nam"" (dude!) stereotypes and make a buck. Have respect for the real vets.
