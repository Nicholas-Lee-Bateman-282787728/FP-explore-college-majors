First off i'm glad that i was able to get this series and in one place as well.  The story basically revolves around Anna and Go, who he saves earlier in the story.  But they get married and even though she's at the young age of 17.  She sometimes does act like a 12 year old still.  But she shows great potential in the piloting one of the giant robots on the base where Go and her mother whom is in charge of the base at the moment.  I don't want to tell the whole story but they are on the verge of getting married when they get an call that a Memetic beast attack is happening.  Its these monsters that they fought a few years ago.  But its back and has started to spread across the planet.  Also introduced early on are 5 other Robot fighter groups and they have a bigger role in the series soon enough.Just so people know that if they are looking for a kid oriented anime show Godannar..isn't it.  But you can see that from the box cover with the 2 women on front.  There's overt and straight up focus on the females and there (uum huge assets and the jiggling effect) you'll see what i mean and some of the fighter pilots, the Robots and their outfits leave not much to the imagination.  The story progresses over 26 episodes on 5 discs and also goes to the lives of the other people on the base, the mechanics and other folks that work on the robots that Anna, Go, Mira (a person from Go's past) and others.It's cool that they focus on others instead of just one or two characters and their various struggles with all that is going on around them...beasts attacking, falling in love, first crushes, people from past showing up and relationship issues. All this while fighting breaks out all over the world.  I love anime in general have a great liking towards anime series that focus on Robots and pilots.Godannar delivers to me on all fronts, voice acting was pretty good, art and the overall direction of the series always seemed to be heading forward even when they were looking back on what had happened so far.Excellent work...wish it didnt have to end though.",5,"Insanely, funny yet engaging",1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,2121,"['Godannar', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'First', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'series', 'one', 'place', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'basically', 'Anna', 'Go', 'who', 'earlier', 'story', 'get', 'married', 'even', 'young', 'age', '17', 'sometimes', 'act', '12', 'year', 'old', 'still', 'great', 'potential', 'piloting', 'one', 'giant', 'robots', 'base', 'where', 'Go', 'mother', 'whom', 'charge', 'base', 'moment', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'are', 'verge', 'getting', 'married', 'when', 'get', 'call', 'Memetic', 'beast', 'attack', 'happening', 'monsters', 'fought', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'back', 'started', 'spread', 'planet', 'Also', 'introduced', 'early', 'are', '5', 'other', 'Robot', 'fighter', 'groups', 'have', 'bigger', 'role', 'series', 'soon', 'enough.Just', 'so', 'people', 'know', 'are', 'looking', 'kid', 'oriented', 'anime', 'show', 'Godannar..is', ""n't"", 'can', 'see', 'box', 'cover', '2', 'women', 'front', 'overt', 'straight', 'up', 'focus', 'females', 'uum', 'huge', 'assets', 'jiggling', 'effect', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'i', 'mean', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'Robots', 'outfits', 'leave', 'not', 'much', 'imagination', 'story', '26', 'episodes', '5', 'discs', 'also', 'lives', 'other', 'people', 'base', 'mechanics', 'other', 'folks', 'work', 'robots', 'Anna', 'Go', 'Mira', 'person', 'Go', 'past', 'cool', 'focus', 'others', 'instead', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'various', 'struggles', 'going', 'attacking', 'falling', 'love', 'first', 'crushes', 'people', 'past', 'showing', 'up', 'relationship', 'issues', 'fighting', 'breaks', 'out', 'world', 'love', 'anime', 'general', 'have', 'great', 'liking', 'towards', 'anime', 'series', 'Robots', 'pilots.Godannar', 'delivers', 'fronts', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'art', 'overall', 'direction', 'series', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'heading', 'forward', 'even', 'when', 'were', 'looking', 'back', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'so', 'far.Excellent', 'work', 'wish', 'have', 'end', 'though']",Godannar: Complete Collection
1068727,A2A3PV7XG6ZGM5,B000P6R5KC,Michael Harmon,"[22, 23]","Since I've already reviewed each individual volume of this series, this review wont go too in depth into the storyline. For a broader more deep review I suggest looking at those reviews.Anyway this series by far has it all; drama, comedy, action, sci-fi and believe it or not its kinda like a soap opera only more grown up and fun. Now to say I didnt notice the fan service would be a lie. This series has a lot. Sadly the cover of this complete collection really only shows that aspect. Fan service there may be, but fan service this series is not about. This series has a ton of heart with great characters, cool mecha and a storyline that will surprise you at how engrossing it becomes. The animation is top notch and the voice acting is superb. Honestly I think the English voice acting is better and allows you to fully take in the awesome visuals. Ladies, dont think this is just a guys series because of the voluptuous women and the giant robots. The guys arent bad looking either and it may be shown far less than the women but the fan service is there for you too. Also these are some of the toughest smartest chicks Ive seen in anime, not just pretty faces with amazing bodies. My wife who hates mecha, I repeat HATES mecha, loves this show for the all the things Ive mentioned above.This collection has both seasons in it for a total of 26 episodes and for $70 retail, and Ive seen it for cheaper at around $55 dollars in stores and at the time of this review about $35 here on Amazon, you are getting an amazing buy. Of course being a thinpack this collection has been stripped of the awesome and numerous extras from the individual volumes, but for half the price of retail and in most places cheaper than that, this is a steal!",5,Animes Best Kept Secret,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,1741,"[""'ve"", 'already', 'reviewed', 'individual', 'volume', 'series', 'review', 'wont', 'go', 'too', 'depth', 'storyline', 'broader', 'more', 'deep', 'review', 'suggest', 'looking', 'reviews.Anyway', 'series', 'far', 'drama', 'comedy', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'believe', 'not', 'kinda', 'soap', 'opera', 'only', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'fun', 'Now', 'say', 'didnt', 'notice', 'fan', 'service', 'would', 'be', 'lie', 'series', 'lot', 'Sadly', 'cover', 'complete', 'collection', 'really', 'only', 'aspect', 'Fan', 'service', 'may', 'be', 'fan', 'service', 'series', 'not', 'about', 'series', 'ton', 'heart', 'great', 'characters', 'cool', 'mecha', 'storyline', 'will', 'surprise', 'how', 'engrossing', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'voice', 'acting', 'superb', 'Honestly', 'think', 'English', 'voice', 'acting', 'better', 'fully', 'take', 'awesome', 'visuals', 'Ladies', 'dont', 'think', 'just', 'guys', 'series', 'voluptuous', 'women', 'giant', 'robots', 'guys', 'arent', 'bad', 'looking', 'may', 'be', 'shown', 'far', 'less', 'women', 'fan', 'service', 'there', 'too', 'Also', 'are', 'toughest', 'smartest', 'chicks', 'Ive', 'seen', 'anime', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'bodies', 'wife', 'who', 'mecha', 'repeat', 'HATES', 'mecha', 'show', 'things', 'Ive', 'mentioned', 'above.This', 'collection', 'seasons', 'total', '26', 'episodes', '70', 'retail', 'Ive', 'seen', 'cheaper', '55', 'dollars', 'stores', 'time', 'review', '35', 'here', 'Amazon', 'are', 'getting', 'amazing', 'buy', 'course', 'being', 'thinpack', 'collection', 'been', 'stripped', 'awesome', 'numerous', 'extras', 'individual', 'volumes', 'price', 'retail', 'most', 'places', 'cheaper', 'steal']",Godannar: Complete Collection
1068728,A1UU6ETAY6TBRH,B000P6R5KC,Porcupine,"[7, 9]","There are already numerous Godannar reviews on amazon.com on for the individual volumes, so I'll just review the DVD release itself.Like most ADVision thinpack sets, all the extras have been removed, which is unfortunate since Godannar had some nice extras. Mainly, the clean openings and closings, and various pictures and galleries. You don't get the paper inserts either, and the Godannar insert mini-booklets had some nice mini-posters as well as cast interviews.On the other hand all the packaging is different and kind of interesting for this thinpack release. The box itself is orange overall and contains a terrific picture of Mira, Shizuru, and Godannar on one side (the Mira picture is new) and a picture of Anna on the other side (same picture as the Godannar DVD 7 cover). There are 5 DVDs total, each with 5 episodes except for the last one which has 6 episodes on it. Each DVD thinpack case has an orange cover with a big picture of a robot on it, and each DVD itself has an orange picture with a picture of a girl on it. From first to last, the robot pictures are Godannar (fused), Club Mariner, G-Gunner, Goddiner, and Godannar (blue) with Neo-Okusaer. The girl pictures are Anna, Lou, Shizuru, then surprisingly Luna (pilot of Genesister with yellow hair in pigtails), then finally....Anna's mom?! Yuck oh well. Why not Mira? The Luna picture is new, the rest we've seen before. Kind of weird packaging, but it's for the most part different, and a couple of them are really nice (Mira and Luna).The DVD menus are also new. They are orange too, and stationary, and ugly. Oh well. The show itself is exactly the same as on the individual volumes. The Season 2 intros in particular remain blurry, which sucks.Godannar is the best show ever made though and for this price it's a bargain, so I recommend this box set to anyone who hasn't purchased the individual volumes yet. But if you already have the individual volumes, you probably shouldn't bother getting this. In my case, I found a good deal so I bought it just to have an extra copy of Godannar. I paid close to $30 for this boxset, and I paid about $210 to buy all 7 volumes individually (I paid retail price back then, although I got my copies 2-3 weeks before the release dates because of that). This version can also be more convenient to watch if you want more episodes to be on a disc.Someday I'll have to re-author my own version of Godannar by cutting out the blurry Season Two intros and replacing them with the normal-quality textless Season Two intros found on the original DVDs.",5,Completely different packaging,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,2561,"['are', 'already', 'numerous', 'Godannar', 'reviews', 'amazon.com', 'individual', 'volumes', ""'ll"", 'just', 'review', 'DVD', 'release', 'itself.Like', 'most', 'ADVision', 'thinpack', 'sets', 'extras', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'unfortunate', 'Godannar', 'had', 'nice', 'extras', 'Mainly', 'clean', 'openings', 'closings', 'various', 'pictures', 'galleries', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'paper', 'Godannar', 'insert', 'mini-booklets', 'had', 'nice', 'mini-posters', 'as', 'well', 'cast', 'other', 'hand', 'packaging', 'different', 'kind', 'interesting', 'thinpack', 'release', 'box', 'orange', 'overall', 'terrific', 'picture', 'Mira', 'Shizuru', 'Godannar', 'one', 'side', 'Mira', 'picture', 'new', 'picture', 'Anna', 'other', 'side', 'same', 'picture', 'Godannar', 'DVD', '7', 'cover', 'are', '5', 'DVDs', 'total', '5', 'episodes', 'last', 'one', '6', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'thinpack', 'case', 'orange', 'cover', 'big', 'picture', 'robot', 'DVD', 'orange', 'picture', 'picture', 'girl', 'first', 'last', 'robot', 'pictures', 'are', 'Godannar', 'fused', 'Club', 'Mariner', 'G-Gunner', 'Goddiner', 'Godannar', 'blue', 'Neo-Okusaer', 'girl', 'pictures', 'are', 'Anna', 'Lou', 'Shizuru', 'then', 'surprisingly', 'Luna', 'pilot', 'Genesister', 'yellow', 'hair', 'pigtails', 'then', 'finally', '.Anna', 'mom', 'Yuck', 'oh', 'well', 'Why', 'not', 'Mira', 'Luna', 'picture', 'new', 'rest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Kind', 'weird', 'packaging', 'most', 'part', 'different', 'couple', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'Mira', 'Luna', '.The', 'DVD', 'menus', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'are', 'orange', 'too', 'stationary', 'ugly', 'Oh', 'well', 'show', 'exactly', 'same', 'individual', 'volumes', 'Season', '2', 'intros', 'particular', 'remain', 'blurry', 'sucks.Godannar', 'best', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'price', 'bargain', 'recommend', 'box', 'set', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'purchased', 'individual', 'volumes', 'yet', 'already', 'have', 'individual', 'volumes', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'bother', 'getting', 'case', 'found', 'good', 'deal', 'bought', 'just', 'have', 'extra', 'copy', 'Godannar', 'paid', 'close', '30', 'boxset', 'paid', 'about', '210', 'buy', '7', 'volumes', 'individually', 'paid', 'retail', 'price', 'back', 'then', 'got', 'copies', '2-3', 'weeks', 'release', 'version', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'more', 'convenient', 'watch', 'want', 'more', 'episodes', 'be', 'disc.Someday', ""'ll"", 'have', 're-author', 'own', 'version', 'Godannar', 'cutting', 'out', 'blurry', 'Season', 'Two', 'intros', 'replacing', 'normal-quality', 'textless', 'Season', 'Two', 'intros', 'found', 'original', 'DVDs']",Godannar: Complete Collection
1068729,AFV2584U13XP3,B000P6R5KC,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[2, 3]",I got this expecting a light-hearted humorous mecha anime.  I'm sad to say it wasn't that much of anything yes there are mechs and robot fights in this show as well as a lot of fanservice enough to get sick of in as little as three episodes.  While I knew there would be some fanservice it just seemed to me that the people who did this show just kept to that area and did not give much else such as a true character development for anyone.  The show tries to give you some background stories for some of the characters like Anna and Go but all in all you really start to not care for any of them to much which is sad to say as they could have done such a better job with this series.  The video is widecreen format as well as 5.1 English audio and 2.0 Japanese audio you don't get many extras just some previews on the first disk and some text-less intro/ending songs.  So if your looking for a mecha anime but with a touch of humor I say go for Full Metal Panic this series is spectacular sadly unlike this one...,2,Light-Hearted Mecha Anime But No True Greatness,1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,1015,"['got', 'expecting', 'light-hearted', 'humorous', 'mecha', 'anime', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'anything', 'yes', 'are', 'mechs', 'robot', 'fights', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'fanservice', 'enough', 'get', 'sick', 'as', 'little', 'three', 'episodes', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'fanservice', 'just', 'seemed', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'show', 'just', 'kept', 'area', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'much', 'else', 'such', 'true', 'character', 'development', 'anyone', 'show', 'give', 'background', 'stories', 'characters', 'Anna', 'Go', 'really', 'start', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'sad', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'series', 'video', 'widecreen', 'format', 'as', 'well', '5.1', 'English', 'audio', '2.0', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'many', 'extras', 'just', 'previews', 'first', 'disk', 'text-less', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'So', 'looking', 'mecha', 'anime', 'touch', 'humor', 'say', 'go', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'series', 'spectacular', 'sadly', 'one']",Godannar: Complete Collection
1068730,A10U58PHFDK81C,B000P6R5KC,The Anime  Adict,"[1, 3]","Godannar get 4 out of five for me. Before my review, his is not a show for kids there is a lot of fanfare a lot. Then there are some rather grizzly transformations.Now then on to the review. First the good stuff. The best thing about the series is the animation, one word wow. It's smooth, streamline and extremely well done. The voice acting in both dub are also exceptionally well done. The music is about what you'd except for a show like this. The Characters are all likeable and are pretty easy to identify with on a shallow level and nice to look at. The Badies and the Giant Robots were cool looking.Unfortunately no come the bad parts about the series. One is that all but a few of the characters are extremely shallow and cliche. There is no motives given to the bad guys actions or the good guys beyond evil monster trying destroy world for the heck of it verse good guys trying to save world for the heck of it. However above and beyond all this the biggest problem Godannar has is its lack of depth. Once in awhile it shows a glimmer of it but just doesn't maintain it. The blistering fast pacing of the show attempts to cover for the shallowness and lack of substances and keep you from realizing that you've seen absolutely everything hundreds of times in different stories. Added to this I just couldn't stop myself from really really disliking the main female lead Anna. I didn't quiet hate her but came pretty close. Over all the problems with her character is she's married and is only 17 with the maturity of one thrown into rather complicated situations that are simply beyond her understanding. Sadly this and the shallowness and cliche of everything is prevented the series from getting a better review from me. I would have loved to give it five stars but I would feel to guilty about giving such a shallow series a perfect rating.Now the all important question. Should you buy this series or not? Yes go a head, it costs less then $40 to buy a box set why not.Before I go a review of the actual box set itself. The box set is one of ADV's new thin pack packages. Best thing about the box set is the cases are small and don't take up much space. The box for the case is sturdy and well made with nice art work. But that's really all the good things I can say about the box set. Normal I wouldn't recommend getting the box set, like most of the thin box sets. Why you ask? Well for a simple reason is ADV goes threw each disc and removes all of the extra content with the exception of a few trailers on the first disc. This means the textless opening and closings, insert pages even the reversible covers are all gone which sucks big time. If it were a shorter series, I'd say to buy the individual discs. However the box set is less then $40 dollars which is hard to argue with especially since the series isn't worth much more then that.",4,"Good, not great",1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,2861,"['Godannar', 'get', '4', 'five', 'review', 'not', 'show', 'kids', 'lot', 'fanfare', 'lot', 'Then', 'are', 'rather', 'grizzly', 'transformations.Now', 'then', 'review', 'First', 'good', 'stuff', 'best', 'thing', 'series', 'animation', 'one', 'word', 'wow', 'smooth', 'streamline', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'voice', 'acting', 'dub', 'are', 'also', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'music', 'what', ""'d"", 'except', 'show', 'Characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'are', 'pretty', 'easy', 'identify', 'shallow', 'level', 'nice', 'look', 'Badies', 'Giant', 'Robots', 'were', 'cool', 'looking.Unfortunately', 'come', 'bad', 'parts', 'series', 'One', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'shallow', 'cliche', 'motives', 'given', 'bad', 'guys', 'actions', 'good', 'guys', 'evil', 'monster', 'trying', 'destroy', 'world', 'heck', 'verse', 'good', 'guys', 'trying', 'save', 'world', 'heck', 'However', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Godannar', 'lack', 'depth', 'Once', 'awhile', 'glimmer', 'just', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'blistering', 'fast', 'pacing', 'show', 'cover', 'shallowness', 'lack', 'substances', 'keep', 'realizing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'hundreds', 'times', 'different', 'stories', 'Added', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'really', 'really', 'disliking', 'main', 'female', 'lead', 'Anna', 'did', ""n't"", 'quiet', 'hate', 'came', 'pretty', 'close', 'problems', 'character', 'married', 'only', '17', 'maturity', 'one', 'thrown', 'rather', 'complicated', 'situations', 'are', 'simply', 'understanding', 'Sadly', 'shallowness', 'cliche', 'everything', 'prevented', 'series', 'getting', 'better', 'review', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'feel', 'guilty', 'giving', 'such', 'shallow', 'series', 'perfect', 'rating.Now', 'important', 'question', 'Should', 'buy', 'series', 'not', 'Yes', 'go', 'head', 'less', 'then', '40', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'why', 'not.Before', 'go', 'review', 'actual', 'box', 'set', 'box', 'set', 'one', 'ADV', 'new', 'thin', 'pack', 'packages', 'Best', 'thing', 'box', 'set', 'cases', 'are', 'small', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'much', 'space', 'box', 'case', 'sturdy', 'well', 'made', 'nice', 'art', 'work', 'really', 'good', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'box', 'set', 'Normal', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'box', 'set', 'most', 'thin', 'box', 'sets', 'Why', 'ask', 'Well', 'simple', 'reason', 'ADV', 'threw', 'disc', 'extra', 'content', 'exception', 'few', 'trailers', 'first', 'disc', 'textless', 'opening', 'closings', 'insert', 'pages', 'even', 'reversible', 'covers', 'are', 'gone', 'big', 'time', 'were', 'shorter', 'series', ""'d"", 'say', 'buy', 'individual', 'discs', 'However', 'box', 'set', 'less', 'then', '40', 'dollars', 'hard', 'argue', 'especially', 'series', ""n't"", 'worth', 'much', 'more', 'then']",Godannar: Complete Collection
