As they go around the world to promote their new album at that time, &#34;Black and Blue&#34;. They did this 2 hour &#34;MTV Diary Special&#34; as well as interviews for their MTV TRL Special and ABC special at the time for the tour. I gave it a high rating due to their honesty of what is like to be the world's best singers and pop stars at that time. As well as for awesome they are to all of their fans at any age at the time. It is worth the buy. 5 Full stars. All Hardcore Backstreet Boys and pop music fans will love it.:)",5,Backstreet Boys around the world in 100 hours!,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,662,"['Remember', 'MTV', 'Diarys', '1999', 'ward', 'was', 'special', 'MTV', 'featuring', 'best', 'Boyband', 'Male', 'Band', 'EVER', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'go', 'world', 'promote', 'new', 'album', 'time', '34', 'Black', 'Blue', '34', 'did', '2', 'hour', '34', 'MTV', 'Diary', 'Special', '34', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'MTV', 'TRL', 'Special', 'ABC', 'special', 'time', 'tour', 'gave', 'high', 'rating', 'due', 'honesty', 'what', 'be', 'world', 'best', 'singers', 'pop', 'stars', 'time', 'As', 'well', 'are', 'fans', 'age', 'time', 'buy', '5', 'Full', 'stars', 'Hardcore', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'pop', 'music', 'fans', 'will', 'love']",N/A

It isnt something you see very often or if at all.  Going all around the world making 6 different stops on different continents in a 100 hours.  The outcome is the same fans all over the world were showing mad love for BSB.  Rio seemed to be the most energetic but all the other stops were on point as well.  A great look into a group that continues to do what others can't and thats to stick around for the long haul.  Excellent buy for BSB fans everywhere.,5,very cool,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,519,"['was', 'great', 'see', 'guys', 'BSB', 'do', 'something', 'something', 'see', 'very', 'often', 'Going', 'world', 'making', '6', 'different', 'stops', 'different', 'continents', '100', 'hours', 'outcome', 'same', 'fans', 'world', 'were', 'showing', 'mad', 'love', 'BSB', 'Rio', 'seemed', 'be', 'most', 'energetic', 'other', 'stops', 'were', 'point', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'look', 'group', 'do', 'what', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'thats', 'stick', 'around', 'long', 'haul', 'Excellent', 'buy', 'BSB', 'fans', 'everywhere']",N/A
