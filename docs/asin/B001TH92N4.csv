1236274,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001TH92N4,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Frost/Nixon, 2008 filmThe movie begins with the news of the Watergate Burglary in June 1972. Then other news of the growing scandal. The secret tapes, and their contents, led to the impeachment and resignation of Richard M. Nixon. [Ever wonder what was kept secret by this action?] David Frost had a show in Australia when this happened. Later Frost had a chance to interview Nixon for his show. Nixon wrote a book of memoirs, it needed promotion and publicity. Who would do the interview, Mike Wallace or the unknown David Frost? Who gave the high bid? TV networks are contacted to pay Frost for this show. Nixon made sure his name was on the check. Frost plans about 30 hours of taping. What will the show do? Frost prepared for four ninety-minute shows. The interview takes place in a private home.Nixon explains why he taped all conversations - to keep a record. He explains why he chose to invade Cambodia against the advice of his experts. [Was his answer a mistake?] Nixon talks about foreign affairs. At home Nixon plays the piano. Frost learns of his cancelled show in Australia. Nixon calls Frost for a personal talk (and tells about his past experiences). Afterwards Frost prepares for the next interview about Watergate. ""What phone call?"" Nixon explains why he didn't ""obstruct justice"". ""What the President does is not illegal."" An unplanned emotional disclosure? Were there mistakes, crimes, abuse of power? ""Well its true."" [Does he concede too much?] He let down the country and the system.Does television oversimplify events? Does it take events out of context? These shows were wildly popular. Frost presents a pair of shoes to Nixon. The investors in Frost's show profited well, as did Frost. Was Nixon rehabilitated? Yes, and this may have been the purpose of this show. ""Would you buy a used car from him?"" I don't remember seeing these shows in 1977. Were they ever published for viewing? Why then create a fictionalized version? To rewrite history? This movie was adapted from a play based on the actual TV show shown in May 1977. Was there a hidden agenda for this play?Richard Nixon is the only man elected vice-president twice, and president twice. Also the only president to resign after a vote of impeachment in Congress. I always wondered if the charges were only the tip of the iceberg. H. R. Haldeman wrote what Nixon meant by ""the bay of pigs"". Nixon was personally involved with the burglary, he didn't leave it to his underlings for ""plausible denial"".

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[0, 0]","I grew up watching David Frost as a kid in England (everyone of that age can imitate him saying, ""Hello, good evening and welcome."") It's not true to suggest, as this movie does, that he was a lightweight talk show host. He had hosted a smart, satirical show (""That was the Week that Was) and had conducted many inciteful political interviews. But it's better for the drama of the movie to pretend he was a fun-loving neophyte when he went head-to-head with Nixon.It's weird watching this movie because Michael Sheen is close to being Frost and yet different while Frank Langella is somewhat like Nixon, and yet also different. Both are superb and the movie provides them ample opportunity to fence verbally and strike sparks off each other.One criticism: the movie freights their encounter with a significance I don't think it had in reality. It makes it seem somehow crucial to U.S, democracy that Frost should get Nixon to admit his wrongdoing. It made it seem like a stunning defeat for Nixon that he did. Yet Nixon did enjoy a partial rehabilitation as informal elder statesman in the remaining years of his life. doling out advice to his successors.Having said that, I enjoyed this movie greatly.

1236279,AGEIT17HENDIS,B001TH92N4,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","The following is from my review of the original (real) Frost/Nixon interviews. With the addition of a kudo for the fine performance of Frank Langella and a nod to the good sense of dramatic timing in the Hollywood version my points on the original intereviwes stand.""The Original Frost/Nixon Watergate Interviews- Parental Guidance AdvisedFrost/Nixon: The Original Watergate Interview, David Frost, Richard Milhous Nixon, 1977Apparently some things will not remain in the bottle. That appears to be the case with one Richard Milhous Nixon, one time President of the United States, certified demon and off-handedly a common criminal. Just when you though it was safe to go outdoors to get a little fresh air here he rises again to scare the bejesus out of another generation of idealistic young people and send his old time political opponents, including this reviewer, screaming in the night. What has brought on the fear?Well, for one the recent notoriety around the movie ""Frost/Nixon"", the ""story"" behind the celebrated attempt by Nixon to `help' rewrite the second draft of history on his presidency and for Frost to leap-frog to the front of the journalist pantheon. That is what I thought I had bargained for when I ordered up what I assumed was a copy of the movie. What I got was far, far worst, a copy of the original Watergate segments of the original Frost/Nixon television interviews from 1977. I will, eventually, after my pulse returns to normal, get a copy of the movie and review that in this space but for now I will make a few comments on this little documentary gem.As fate would have it I have recently been reading (or rather re-re-reading) ""Dr. Gonzo"" journalist Hunter S. Thompson's compilation volume entitled ""The Great Shark Hunt"". Included in the selections were a series of articles that Thompson did for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine from his ""mythical"" National Affairs Desk at the time of the Nixon-era Watergate hearings in 1974. Thompson, not afraid to deride Nixon when he was riding high was more than willing to skewer him on his way down. To give a flavor of the times, of Thompson's appreciation of what the name Nixon meant to our generation and the importance of exposing that little crook to the clear light of day (something that, unfortunately, never really happened as he ran down some rat hole) I am reposting the concluding paragraph from a review I did of his ""Songs Of The Doomed"" in 2006:""As a member of the generation of 1968 I would note that this was a period of particular importance which won Hunter his spurs as a journalist. Hunter, like many of us, cut his political teeth on one Richard Milhous Nixon, at one time President of the United States and all- around political chameleon. Thompson went way out of his way, and with pleasure, skewering that man when he was riding high. He was moreover just as happy to kick him when he was down, just for good measure. Nixon represented the `dark side' of the American spirit- the side that appears today as the bully boy of the world and as craven brute. If for nothing else Brother Thompson deserves a place in the pantheon of journalistic heroes for this exercise in elementary political hygiene. Anyone who wants to rehabilitate THAT man before history please consult Thompson's work. Hunter, I hope you find the Brown Buffalo wherever you are. Read this book. Read all his books.""And that last sentence kind of says it all. Probably from the minute that he resigned in disgrace in August 1974 Nixon began his little campaign to ""rehabilitate"" himself and move up in the presidential pecking order from dead last to at least beat the likes of James Buchanan and Millard Fillmore. He should not have bothered. His grilling by the well-prepared Frost (who had his own personal agenda in getting involved in this project) was as full of self-justifications, obfuscations, down right balderdash and melodramatic nonsense as one could take in an hour and one half presentation.Even three years later he still didn't get it. The basic premise that Nixon and his staff worked under while president was that of the ""divine right of kings"" a theory discredited a couple of centuries ago. But why go on. Whether you want to view this little film as horror, humor or hubris do not, and I repeat do not, do it while you are depressed about the state of the world. As noted above- Be forewarned this film is not for the faint-hearted. Parental Guidance is very definitely suggested for all concerned.""",4,Hollywood's Frost/Nixon Interviews- Parental Guidance Still Advised,1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,4488,"['following', 'review', 'original', 'real', 'Frost/Nixon', 'interviews', 'addition', 'kudo', 'fine', 'performance', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'nod', 'good', 'sense', 'dramatic', 'timing', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'points', 'original', 'intereviwes', 'stand', 'Original', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Watergate', 'Interviews-', 'Parental', 'Guidance', 'AdvisedFrost/Nixon', 'Original', 'Watergate', 'Interview', 'David', 'Frost', 'Richard', 'Milhous', 'Nixon', '1977Apparently', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'remain', 'bottle', 'be', 'case', 'one', 'Richard', 'Milhous', 'Nixon', 'one', 'time', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'certified', 'demon', 'off-handedly', 'common', 'criminal', 'Just', 'when', 'was', 'safe', 'go', 'outdoors', 'get', 'little', 'fresh', 'air', 'here', 'again', 'scare', 'bejesus', 'generation', 'idealistic', 'young', 'people', 'send', 'old', 'time', 'political', 'opponents', 'including', 'reviewer', 'screaming', 'night', 'What', 'brought', 'fear', 'Well', 'one', 'recent', 'notoriety', 'movie', 'Frost/Nixon', 'story', 'celebrated', 'attempt', 'Nixon', 'help', 'rewrite', 'second', 'draft', 'history', 'presidency', 'Frost', 'leap-frog', 'front', 'journalist', 'pantheon', 'what', 'thought', 'had', 'bargained', 'when', 'ordered', 'up', 'what', 'assumed', 'was', 'copy', 'movie', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'far', 'far', 'worst', 'copy', 'original', 'Watergate', 'segments', 'original', 'Frost/Nixon', 'television', 'interviews', '1977', 'will', 'eventually', 'pulse', 'returns', 'normal', 'get', 'copy', 'movie', 'review', 'space', 'now', 'will', 'make', 'few', 'comments', 'little', 'documentary', 'gem.As', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'recently', 'been', 'reading', 'rather', 're-re-reading', 'Dr.', 'Gonzo', 'journalist', 'Hunter', 'S.', 'Thompson', 'compilation', 'volume', 'entitled', 'Great', 'Shark', 'Hunt', 'Included', 'selections', 'were', 'series', 'articles', 'Thompson', 'did', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'mythical', 'National', 'Affairs', 'Desk', 'time', 'Nixon-era', 'Watergate', 'hearings', '1974', 'Thompson', 'not', 'afraid', 'deride', 'Nixon', 'when', 'was', 'riding', 'high', 'was', 'more', 'willing', 'skewer', 'way', 'down', 'give', 'flavor', 'times', 'Thompson', 'appreciation', 'what', 'name', 'Nixon', 'meant', 'generation', 'importance', 'exposing', 'little', 'crook', 'clear', 'light', 'day', 'something', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'really', 'happened', 'ran', 'down', 'rat', 'hole', 'am', 'reposting', 'concluding', 'paragraph', 'review', 'did', 'Songs', 'Doomed', '2006', 'member', 'generation', '1968', 'would', 'note', 'was', 'period', 'particular', 'importance', 'won', 'Hunter', 'spurs', 'journalist', 'Hunter', 'many', 'cut', 'political', 'teeth', 'one', 'Richard', 'Milhous', 'Nixon', 'one', 'time', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'all-', 'around', 'political', 'chameleon', 'Thompson', 'went', 'way', 'way', 'pleasure', 'skewering', 'man', 'when', 'was', 'riding', 'high', 'was', 'moreover', 'just', 'happy', 'kick', 'when', 'was', 'down', 'just', 'good', 'measure', 'Nixon', 'represented', 'dark', 'side', 'American', 'spirit-', 'side', 'today', 'bully', 'boy', 'world', 'craven', 'brute', 'nothing', 'else', 'Brother', 'Thompson', 'place', 'pantheon', 'journalistic', 'heroes', 'exercise', 'elementary', 'political', 'hygiene', 'Anyone', 'who', 'rehabilitate', 'THAT', 'man', 'history', 'please', 'consult', 'Thompson', 'work', 'Hunter', 'hope', 'find', 'Brown', 'Buffalo', 'are', 'Read', 'book', 'Read', 'books', 'last', 'sentence', 'kind', 'Probably', 'minute', 'resigned', 'disgrace', 'August', '1974', 'Nixon', 'began', 'little', 'campaign', 'rehabilitate', 'move', 'up', 'presidential', 'pecking', 'order', 'dead', 'last', 'least', 'beat', 'likes', 'James', 'Buchanan', 'Millard', 'Fillmore', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'bothered', 'grilling', 'well-prepared', 'Frost', 'who', 'had', 'own', 'personal', 'agenda', 'getting', 'involved', 'project', 'was', 'full', 'self-justifications', 'obfuscations', 'down', 'right', 'balderdash', 'melodramatic', 'nonsense', 'one', 'could', 'take', 'hour', 'one', 'half', 'presentation.Even', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'basic', 'premise', 'Nixon', 'staff', 'worked', 'president', 'was', 'divine', 'right', 'kings', 'theory', 'discredited', 'couple', 'centuries', 'ago', 'why', 'go', 'Whether', 'want', 'view', 'little', 'film', 'horror', 'humor', 'hubris', 'do', 'not', 'repeat', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'are', 'depressed', 'state', 'world', 'noted', 'above-', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'film', 'not', 'faint-hearted', 'Parental', 'Guidance', 'very', 'definitely', 'suggested', 'concerned']",Frost/Nixon

Peter Morgan has done some amazing work in the past, writing the screenplays of the Queen and the Last King of Scotland. I would consider it worth renting simply for the acting alone. Nixon was never tried because he received a pardon from Gerald Ford. This interview was done by David Frost with the view of giving Nixon a public trail. Nixon agrees to do the interview only because he takes Frost lightly and thinks he can control the course of the interview. Frost bags Nixon because he wants to change the course of his career and wants to be taken seriously. He pays one million for the right to interview Nixon, much of the money coming from his own pocket. The first three interviews go in Nixon's way because he is more experienced in deflecting and also using up the allocated interview time. It is only during the final interview that Frost manages to get Nixon's apologies for his role in the Watergate scandal. You may like the movie depending on your interest in matters as such.

1236281,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001TH92N4,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","I don't think a single movie this decade as surprised me (in a good way) as much as `Frost/Nixon' did.  I mean, I walked into this having almost zero expectations.  Well, to be honest, I had expectations, they just weren't very high.  Truth be told, I love a good biopic.  On the other hand, I kind of hate the news and so the idea of a biopic centered around an interview put me off almost immediately.  Next, I'm not really into politics, like at all.  I wasn't around in the 70's and so I really don't know much about Watergate at all.  From the previews I got a very hammy and stagy vibe from Oscar nominee Frank Langella, and the very thought to Ron Howard directing this just rubbed me the wrong way.  This film seemed to need a more cynical touch, and Howard's schmaltzy sentiment, while effective in biopics about washed up boxers and schizophrenic geniuses, would have been distracting and inappropriate here.So, with all that said, I really expected this to be fairly bad.Instead, what I received here was a brilliantly constructed exercise in organic tension that kept me completely engrossed from start to finish.  I mean, this movie really never lets up.  Taking a different approach than one I was expecting, `Frost/Nixon' adds layers of creativity to keep the audience intrigued.  I loved the idea of splicing in faux documentary interviews with the cast.  I also loved how this film had elements of almost sporadic construction that was not something I was used to seeing from Howard.  With a subject as straightforward as the Frost/Nixon interviews, Howard handled things in a way that made things appear bigger than maybe they were.  He added so much external tension that we were on edge throughout; not something I was anticipating.And how about that cast!When one thinks of an ensemble they usually think of a big cast with lots of screen time.  Look at `Gosford Park' or `Nine' for recent examples.  What I love so much about `Frost/Nixon' is that, while it has two clear lead performances, the supporting cast truly uses the most of their small parts.  Everyone comes together to create a unified and cohesive representation of the time and the circumstances.  Some don't fair as well as others (I found Rockwell to be a tad overdone and that stagy feeling I had when watching the trailers did rear its head with Langella at times) but some of the cast really nailed things.  Kevin Bacon, Matthew Macfadyen, Rebecca Hall and especially Michael Sheen just completely understood their roles and delivered magnificently.Ron Howard was the biggest surprise for me.  I was really afraid that he was going to do exactly what Rockwell's character James Reston was afraid Frost was going to do; overly sympathize a very unsympathetic subject.  Instead, Howard totally understood how important it was to convey the facts as they were, not watering down anything or manipulating anything.  Sure, he laid out the human emotions needed to make both Frost and Nixon become real to us (we see the loneliness in Nixon's eyes, which was needed to make him human to us) but he never went overboard, which he could have easily done.  In fact, in the final frames when Frost says goodbye to Nixon, a part where Howard would have had full opportunity to lather on the sentiment, Howard steadied his hand and crafted a respectful and poignant conclusion to his already near-impeccable film.I don't think there are enough words to convey how pleasantly surprised I am with this extremely well crafted biopic.",5,A dual to the death...,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,3509,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'movie', 'decade', 'surprised', 'good', 'way', 'as', 'much', 'Frost/Nixon', 'did', 'mean', 'walked', 'having', 'almost', 'zero', 'expectations', 'Well', 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'expectations', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'high', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'love', 'good', 'biopic', 'other', 'hand', 'kind', 'hate', 'news', 'so', 'idea', 'biopic', 'centered', 'interview', 'put', 'off', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Next', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'politics', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', '70', 'so', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Watergate', 'previews', 'got', 'very', 'hammy', 'stagy', 'vibe', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'very', 'thought', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'directing', 'just', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'film', 'seemed', 'need', 'more', 'cynical', 'touch', 'Howard', 'schmaltzy', 'sentiment', 'effective', 'biopics', 'washed', 'up', 'boxers', 'schizophrenic', 'geniuses', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'distracting', 'inappropriate', 'here.So', 'said', 'really', 'expected', 'be', 'fairly', 'bad.Instead', 'what', 'received', 'here', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'constructed', 'exercise', 'organic', 'tension', 'kept', 'completely', 'engrossed', 'start', 'finish', 'mean', 'movie', 'really', 'never', 'up', 'Taking', 'different', 'approach', 'one', 'was', 'expecting', 'Frost/Nixon', 'layers', 'creativity', 'keep', 'audience', 'intrigued', 'loved', 'idea', 'splicing', 'faux', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'cast', 'also', 'loved', 'how', 'film', 'had', 'elements', 'almost', 'sporadic', 'construction', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'was', 'used', 'seeing', 'Howard', 'subject', 'as', 'straightforward', 'Frost/Nixon', 'interviews', 'Howard', 'handled', 'things', 'way', 'made', 'things', 'appear', 'bigger', 'maybe', 'were', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'external', 'tension', 'were', 'edge', 'not', 'something', 'was', 'anticipating.And', 'how', 'cast', 'When', 'one', 'ensemble', 'usually', 'think', 'big', 'cast', 'lots', 'screen', 'time', 'Look', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Nine', 'recent', 'examples', 'What', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'Frost/Nixon', 'two', 'clear', 'lead', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'truly', 'most', 'small', 'parts', 'Everyone', 'together', 'create', 'unified', 'cohesive', 'representation', 'time', 'circumstances', 'do', ""n't"", 'fair', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'found', 'Rockwell', 'be', 'tad', 'overdone', 'stagy', 'feeling', 'had', 'when', 'watching', 'trailers', 'did', 'rear', 'head', 'Langella', 'times', 'cast', 'really', 'nailed', 'things', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'just', 'completely', 'understood', 'roles', 'delivered', 'magnificently.Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'really', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'Rockwell', 'character', 'James', 'Reston', 'was', 'afraid', 'Frost', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'overly', 'sympathize', 'very', 'unsympathetic', 'subject', 'Instead', 'Howard', 'totally', 'understood', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'convey', 'facts', 'were', 'not', 'watering', 'down', 'anything', 'manipulating', 'anything', 'Sure', 'laid', 'out', 'human', 'emotions', 'needed', 'make', 'Frost', 'Nixon', 'become', 'real', 'see', 'loneliness', 'Nixon', 'eyes', 'was', 'needed', 'make', 'human', 'never', 'went', 'overboard', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'done', 'fact', 'final', 'frames', 'when', 'Frost', 'goodbye', 'Nixon', 'part', 'where', 'Howard', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'full', 'opportunity', 'lather', 'sentiment', 'Howard', 'steadied', 'hand', 'crafted', 'respectful', 'poignant', 'conclusion', 'already', 'near-impeccable', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'enough', 'words', 'convey', 'how', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'am', 'extremely', 'well', 'crafted', 'biopic']",Frost/Nixon

This movie, however, is even more potent than the actual interviews for a number of reasons. I will attempt to explain why.A lot of people don't remember that David Frost was not all that well known before he did these interviews. He had a show in London and another in Australia, but the American public knew him mostly as a face that showed up now and again on PBS or as a guest on a talk show. He was incredibly young, attractive, fashionable, and had a charming accent and charming ways. But he was not someone you'd expect to make journalism history. However, he certainly did so with these interviews.Frank Langella plays Nixon and Michael Sheen plays Frost. The other characters are background to this head-to-head confrontation. In fact, Nixon himself referred to it as a challenge, a battle, used sports and war metaphors. Frost went into this with sketchy backing, money that was loaned on the basis of their lining up sufficient sponsors. But people were very hesitant to take a chance on it, and he ended up putting his own money on the line. It was a very high-stakes game he was playing with this old pro, skilled at bluffing.The first day, which was to have been centered on Vietnam, never got to any substantial questions. Nixon gave long, rambling answers which Frost was too polite to interrupt. At the end of the session, Nixon's team was jubilant, and Frost's was tearing out its collective hair. They insisted Frost had to be more confrontational, lean forward and go on the attack. One aspect was very powerful. This session was scheduled to be about foreign policy, and so Vietnam was folded into it because it had been pushed out of the first session. And Cambodia. Frost played some news footage of Cambodia, including the wounded and dead civilians, some pretty nasty stuff. Nixon watched it thoughtfully, and argued that it had never been his policy to go after civilians. Still, he rambled and Frost was not able to ask very many questions. Too polite to interrupt.And so it went. But the night before the last interview, the one about Watergate, Nixon called Frost at his hotel room late at night, and he had been drinking. He rambled on in a most pathetic way, attempting to establish common ground with Frost. It was very stirring, moving, and generally gave Frost a way to approach this last interview. And as most of us remember, he broke the man. He got his confession. It was history-making. And career making for Frost, which Nixon acknowledged when Frost and his girlfriend went to Nixon's place to say goodbye before leaving for New York.I have to say that the movie, with all its behind-the-scenes material is far more powerful than the actual interviews themselves, which are now available on DVD with a much older David Frost describing a good bit of the behind-the-scenes material.

E Jackson,"[2, 3]","For those that were around in the early 70's, Frost/Nixon does a GREAT job detailing the events of the Nixon administration and the Watergate scandal (the latter which receives the most attention in the story-telling).For those of you that WEREN'T around back then (like myself) you will learn a LOT about the Nixon scandal.The flow of the story-telling can best be described like this- the first half of the movie deals with a British guy named David Frost, detailing how Frost went about getting the opportunity to interview Richard Nixon and ask the most serious questions of all during a face-to-face, sit-down interview.The questions most Americans wanted answers to at the time is displayed accurately in the movie by Frost's character.  He held absolutely *nothing* back during the interview, making Nixon extremely uncomfortable, and that's why we remember David Frost today.The second half of the film deals with, of course, the lengthy interview segments themselves, but these interviews are NOT done in a boring way.  Far from it in fact.It's the EMOTION during these sit down interviews that truly makes the film remarkable (and deserving of all those awards it won last year).  The way you, the viewer, becomes attached to every word coming out of Frost and Nixon's mouth EVEN if you don't consider yourself someone who has a serious interest in politics, is what makes the film so good.As much attention David Frost receives is perhaps even more than the amount Nixon receives.  I'm surprised the movie writers chose to focus so much on David Frost and less on Nixon.Everything you wanted to know about the Watergate scandal is presented here, and done correctly and accurately.  Not much discussion over Vietnam however, but enough to satisfy me.Anyway, the actor who plays Nixon looks JUST like him, and acts like him as well (and GREAT job imitating Nixon's voice!)  Great performances by all the characters.  You don't necessarily have to follow politics hard and heavy in order to follow along to Frost/Nixon, and because of that, I recommend everyone watch it.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 0]","Those with an interest in recent history will find FROST NIXON a gripping yarn about the fall of former President Richard Nixon from the highest office in our great nation. Thanks to the Watergate break-in, everything corrupt that has anything to do with governmental conspiracies is now labeled with the -gate suffix. There was, of course, a completely different side to Richard Nixon beyond his contemptible actions surrounding this obvious cover up (mainly his opening up of the East and his diplomatic skills that are often underscored thanks to his resignation). But we're not here to talk about them. We're here to find out what could be so engrossing about two men bantering back and forth on a news interview.No doubt the best part of Frost Nixon is Frank Langella (Good Night and Good Luck) as the former President. His mannerisms, strong voice, and facial expressions were spot-on, earning him a much deserved Oscar nod for Best Actor (Sean Penn took home the award in 2009 forMilk...another stellar performance but it was a close race).I'm not going to take anything away from Michael Sheen as Aussie reporter David Frost. Sheen's performances are usually excellent, including his role as Tony Blair inThe Queen. And here he's just as good, it's just that Langella rules every scene they're in (this is obvious since Langella got nominated in just about every major awards ceremony while Sheen did not).I really enjoyed much of the back story surrounding David Frost, too. It was the cornerstone of his success but it also nearly bankrupt him. No one wanted to back him financially, and then trying to find television stations willing to air it was incredibly difficult. But once they heard what Frost had done, the flood gates opened and the interview became the news event of the decade.Director Ron Howard proves that he's still ""got it,"" even though I wasn't too happy with some of his more recent productions, includingThe Da Vinci Code. But his previous works, includingApollo 13,A Beautiful MindandCocoon, far outweigh any negatives I could say about him. And Frost Nixon rates right up there with one of his higher accomplishments. That it was filmed on-location at many of the locales where the actual interviews and meetings took place adds an additional sense of realism for the viewer, too (and it was nice to know). I really enjoyed, too, how pitiable yet ferocious he made Nixon; probably something that wasn't too far off the mark.Frost Nixon is a definite film to watch, and it's a great historical visual aid that can act as a warning to those who would use their power for their own purposes rather than the good of the people.A must see.",4,"Langella Is Amazing ...And Ron Howard Still ""Has It""",1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,2667,"['interest', 'recent', 'history', 'will', 'find', 'FROST', 'NIXON', 'gripping', 'yarn', 'fall', 'former', 'President', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'highest', 'office', 'great', 'nation', 'Thanks', 'Watergate', 'break-in', 'everything', 'corrupt', 'anything', 'do', 'governmental', 'conspiracies', 'now', 'labeled', '-gate', 'suffix', 'was', 'course', 'completely', 'different', 'side', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'contemptible', 'actions', 'surrounding', 'obvious', 'cover', 'up', 'mainly', 'opening', 'East', 'diplomatic', 'skills', 'are', 'often', 'underscored', 'thanks', 'resignation', ""'re"", 'not', 'here', 'talk', ""'re"", 'here', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'engrossing', 'two', 'men', 'bantering', 'back', 'forth', 'news', 'interview.No', 'doubt', 'best', 'part', 'Frost', 'Nixon', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'former', 'President', 'mannerisms', 'strong', 'voice', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'spot-on', 'earning', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'took', 'home', 'award', '2009', 'forMilk', 'stellar', 'performance', 'was', 'close', 'race', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Aussie', 'reporter', 'David', 'Frost', 'Sheen', 'performances', 'are', 'usually', 'excellent', 'including', 'role', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'inThe', 'Queen', 'here', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'just', 'Langella', 'rules', 'scene', ""'re"", 'obvious', 'Langella', 'got', 'nominated', 'just', 'major', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'Sheen', 'did', 'not', '.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'back', 'story', 'surrounding', 'David', 'Frost', 'too', 'was', 'cornerstone', 'success', 'also', 'nearly', 'bankrupt', 'one', 'wanted', 'back', 'financially', 'then', 'trying', 'find', 'television', 'stations', 'willing', 'air', 'was', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'once', 'heard', 'what', 'Frost', 'had', 'done', 'flood', 'gates', 'opened', 'interview', 'became', 'news', 'event', 'decade.Director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'still', 'got', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'more', 'recent', 'productions', 'includingThe', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'previous', 'works', 'includingApollo', '13', 'Beautiful', 'MindandCocoon', 'far', 'outweigh', 'negatives', 'could', 'say', 'Frost', 'Nixon', 'rates', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'one', 'higher', 'accomplishments', 'was', 'filmed', 'on-location', 'many', 'locales', 'where', 'actual', 'interviews', 'meetings', 'took', 'place', 'additional', 'sense', 'realism', 'viewer', 'too', 'was', 'nice', 'know', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'too', 'how', 'pitiable', 'yet', 'ferocious', 'made', 'Nixon', 'probably', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'mark.Frost', 'Nixon', 'definite', 'film', 'watch', 'great', 'historical', 'visual', 'aid', 'can', 'act', 'warning', 'who', 'would', 'use', 'power', 'own', 'purposes', 'rather', 'good', 'people.A', 'must', 'see']",Frost/Nixon

I will definitely be watching out for this guy's work in the future.

1236291,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B001TH92N4,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This historic drama based on the famous interviews by David Frost and former President Nixon is excellent in every way.  The acting is superb with Frank Langella performing the part of a lifetime.  The film dramatizes the 1977 interviews with most of the film devoted to the behind the scenes strategizing for advantage. Exceptional actors, intelligent script, suspenseful and beautifully edited direction all go to make a fine film. However, this film moves beyond that for it moves into a psychological analysis of Nixon in the first years of his disgrace and reveals that he was aware of his misdeeds and that he must take responsibility for his actions and the political philosophy that he nourished within his heart throughout his political career and which tainted the White House staff and their approach to governance.Richard Nixon was the only president to resign while in office rather than face a certain impeachment by the House of Representatives. He was soon pardoned by President Jerald Ford and moved into retirement at this compound in San Clemente California. Thus, a popular television talk show host, David Frost, was not seen as a threat and Nixon was willing to participate in the interviews because he thought he could out maneuver the playboy television personality and he also was paid $500,000 for the 4 interviews (2 hours each). Michael Sheen plays David Frost and he captures the complexity of Frost's personality and ambitions and eventual insight into Richard Nixon that lead to the outstanding admission by Nixon that he had conducted activities that were probably criminal and that he had let the people of the United States down in his conduct as President.Frost believed that the words of admission and sorrow from the President would be a healing message and that it was possible to bring the President to this admission. But President Nixon was a brilliant strategist with the ability to turn any question into an opportunity to appear wise, Presidential, strategic, victimized, intelligent, insightful, considerate, and kind. He was a master at turning a negative question into a 15 minute response that showed him in his best light. The film is excellent at capturing the tension and suspense as each interview is totally dominated by President Nixon and David Frost is continually left licking his wounds, never penetrating beyond the facade presented by President Nixon.The film is also about Frost's desire to recharge his career after having his talk show dropped by a major network but he soon finds that he personally must finance much of the production costs of the interviews. The contract between Frost and Nixon stipulated that Nixon would not be given the questions in advance and would have no editing authority. But Nixon was an absolute master in the art of staying on message, turning any hostile question into an opportunity to look Presidential. He may have accepted the conditions because he knows Frost to be a woman chasing playboy celebrity and not know as a political journalist. This would allow Nixon to shape history to his own liking. Yet, the underlying issue for Frost was healing and not blame, and this may have been his greatest strength in dealing with the President and in the end it is this theme that touches Nixon's core and in so doing, reveals something about the President that is grand.Ron Howard was brilliant to emphasize this theme. For if Frost had interviewed Nixon with the outrageous bully strategies that is so often seen on television today, Nixon would have been an able fighter and the American public would have gone away thinking that the battle was a draw and that this was politics as usual. It was the strategy of seeking admission of misdeeds and then moving the President to state that he had let himself, the office of the Presidency, and the American people down that changed the equation. It is to the President's credit that he becomes a willing participant in this strategy for it took incredible strength of character to abandon every self protective instinct and to rise to a healing apology that was so needed by the nation.The film is excellent, for it reveals that underneath political battles and strategies lies vulnerability and that fear of revealing that vulnerability can lead to great misjudgments but that moving beyond and through the vulnerability is healing. There may be those who think I overly praise Richard Nixon, but I don't. I only say that the man was capable of growth and insight even in his dark defeat and his instinctual connection with the American people guided his voluntary decision to admit he had let himself and the American people down.",5,"Two men, willing to risk everything, in a riviting competition of wills",1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,4675,"['historic', 'drama', 'based', 'famous', 'interviews', 'David', 'Frost', 'former', 'President', 'Nixon', 'excellent', 'way', 'acting', 'superb', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'performing', 'part', 'lifetime', 'film', '1977', 'interviews', 'most', 'film', 'devoted', 'scenes', 'strategizing', 'advantage', 'Exceptional', 'actors', 'intelligent', 'script', 'suspenseful', 'beautifully', 'edited', 'direction', 'go', 'make', 'fine', 'film', 'However', 'film', 'psychological', 'analysis', 'Nixon', 'first', 'years', 'disgrace', 'reveals', 'was', 'aware', 'misdeeds', 'must', 'take', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'political', 'philosophy', 'nourished', 'heart', 'political', 'career', 'tainted', 'White', 'House', 'staff', 'approach', 'governance.Richard', 'Nixon', 'was', 'only', 'president', 'resign', 'office', 'rather', 'face', 'certain', 'impeachment', 'House', 'Representatives', 'was', 'soon', 'pardoned', 'President', 'Jerald', 'Ford', 'moved', 'retirement', 'compound', 'San', 'Clemente', 'California', 'Thus', 'popular', 'television', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'David', 'Frost', 'was', 'not', 'seen', 'threat', 'Nixon', 'was', 'willing', 'participate', 'interviews', 'thought', 'could', 'out', 'maneuver', 'playboy', 'television', 'personality', 'also', 'was', 'paid', '500,000', '4', 'interviews', '2', 'hours', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'David', 'Frost', 'complexity', 'Frost', 'personality', 'ambitions', 'eventual', 'insight', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'lead', 'outstanding', 'admission', 'Nixon', 'had', 'conducted', 'activities', 'were', 'probably', 'criminal', 'had', 'let', 'people', 'United', 'States', 'down', 'conduct', 'President.Frost', 'believed', 'words', 'admission', 'sorrow', 'President', 'would', 'be', 'healing', 'message', 'was', 'possible', 'bring', 'President', 'admission', 'President', 'Nixon', 'was', 'brilliant', 'strategist', 'ability', 'turn', 'question', 'opportunity', 'appear', 'wise', 'Presidential', 'strategic', 'victimized', 'intelligent', 'insightful', 'considerate', 'kind', 'was', 'master', 'turning', 'negative', 'question', '15', 'minute', 'response', 'showed', 'best', 'light', 'film', 'excellent', 'capturing', 'tension', 'suspense', 'interview', 'totally', 'dominated', 'President', 'Nixon', 'David', 'Frost', 'continually', 'left', 'licking', 'wounds', 'never', 'penetrating', 'facade', 'presented', 'President', 'Nixon.The', 'film', 'also', 'Frost', 'desire', 'recharge', 'career', 'having', 'talk', 'show', 'dropped', 'major', 'network', 'soon', 'personally', 'must', 'finance', 'much', 'production', 'costs', 'interviews', 'contract', 'Frost', 'Nixon', 'stipulated', 'Nixon', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'questions', 'advance', 'would', 'have', 'editing', 'authority', 'Nixon', 'was', 'absolute', 'master', 'art', 'staying', 'message', 'turning', 'hostile', 'question', 'opportunity', 'look', 'Presidential', 'may', 'have', 'accepted', 'conditions', 'Frost', 'be', 'woman', 'chasing', 'playboy', 'celebrity', 'not', 'know', 'political', 'journalist', 'would', 'allow', 'Nixon', 'shape', 'history', 'own', 'liking', 'underlying', 'issue', 'Frost', 'was', 'healing', 'not', 'blame', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'greatest', 'strength', 'dealing', 'President', 'end', 'theme', 'Nixon', 'core', 'so', 'doing', 'reveals', 'something', 'President', 'grand.Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'brilliant', 'emphasize', 'theme', 'Frost', 'had', 'interviewed', 'Nixon', 'outrageous', 'bully', 'strategies', 'so', 'often', 'seen', 'television', 'today', 'Nixon', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'fighter', 'American', 'public', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'away', 'thinking', 'battle', 'was', 'draw', 'was', 'politics', 'usual', 'was', 'strategy', 'seeking', 'admission', 'misdeeds', 'then', 'moving', 'President', 'state', 'had', 'let', 'office', 'Presidency', 'American', 'people', 'down', 'changed', 'equation', 'President', 'credit', 'willing', 'participant', 'strategy', 'took', 'incredible', 'strength', 'character', 'abandon', 'self', 'protective', 'instinct', 'rise', 'healing', 'apology', 'was', 'so', 'needed', 'nation.The', 'film', 'excellent', 'underneath', 'political', 'battles', 'strategies', 'vulnerability', 'fear', 'revealing', 'vulnerability', 'can', 'lead', 'great', 'misjudgments', 'moving', 'vulnerability', 'healing', 'may', 'be', 'who', 'think', 'overly', 'praise', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'say', 'man', 'was', 'capable', 'growth', 'insight', 'even', 'dark', 'defeat', 'instinctual', 'connection', 'American', 'people', 'guided', 'voluntary', 'decision', 'admit', 'had', 'let', 'American', 'people', 'down']",Frost/Nixon
1236292,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B001TH92N4,Chris Luallen,"[42, 49]","After the Watergate scandal and his subsequent resignation, Richard Nixon  (Frank Langella) is living in relative seclusion back in California. But, following a lucrative interview offer from British talk show host David Frost (Michael Sheen), Nixon sees an opportunity not only to make some easy money but to return himself to the public spotlight. Meanwhile Frost, best known for chatting with celebrity lightweights, views this as a chance to gain fame and respectability as a journalist in America.Frost is encouraged by his research aides to go hard after Nixon. But instead Frost throws softballs for the first three interview segments and is easily overwhelmed by his more experienced adversary. Then, on the night before the final interview, Frost receives a strange phone call from Nixon, who basically goes off on a drunken rant. Frost, smelling blood, decides to take a more aggressive approach and on the final day Nixon ends up making humiliating admissions about his role in the Watergate cover-up, perhaps cementing his tarnished legacy in American politics.How much you enjoy this movie will probably depend on how much interest you have in the subject matter. But there is no doubt that this is one of those rare motion pictures that reaches near perfection in terms of filmmaking. The acting, especially by Langella, is superb and the sense of dramatic timing is impeccable. The small details were also well handled, such as film's spot on depiction of the 70's and Nixon's bizarre fascination with Frost's Italian leather shoes. This is probably the best directorial outing in Ron Howard's career.

1236293,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001TH92N4,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","Ron Howard, in a strange way, is kind of a hit-or-miss director in that he rarely makes an outright bad movie but some of them are...well they work but not as successfully as others. For every Grinch That Stole Christmas or the Da Vinci Code and to be honest, I didn't care for Cinderella Man, at times he can fire with all cylinders with Apollo 13, Splash and the underrated Ransom. With Frost/Nixon sandwiched inbetween the the Da Vinci Code and its followup Angels and Demons, I always wonder why he doesn't make more of these kind.After the Watergate scandal in which President Nixon resigns from presidency, all of America want is an apology and an admission of wrongdoing. David Frost, a successful talk show host with shows in England and Australia, has his eye on interviews with Nixon, showing a full reveal of his time in office and any mistakes. This of course would help him gain notoreity and fame and being somewhat of a playboy and friendly man, how can he not resist the spotlight? Nixon sees it as a chance to redeem himself and at least let people see his side and try to make himself more favorable to the media and the country. What follows are a series of interviews where they both have a war of words and fight for the victory.It's hard not to see the boxing parellels in the film. From the title, made to look like a marquee matchup headline to Nixon running in place, obviously meant to mirror a boxer preparing himself for the big fight. Even Kevin Bacon, who plays Nixon's advisor, makes a boxing analogy. But like a good match, it's quite compelling and in a similar way to Apollo 13, just as exciting even when we know the outcome. The actual interviews don't come immediately but there's a nice buildup, the bold question right up front only to fall flat on its face when it gets rebounded. The highs and lows of a match are all right here until the underdog gets that one blow that sends the opponent reeling. Heh, I felt Ron Howard does a better job with this interview-as-boxing-match film than he did with Cinderella Man, an actual boxing movie.Part of it comes from the 2 main actors. One can make Michael Sheen's performance the more flashier since he always seems to smile, quite big I might add, and there's not a lot of low moments until one moment in the film when he realizes the full weight of his idea. But he does grow over the course of the interviews where he gets more confident. Though the major highlight is Frank Langella who is not only sounding like the man but seems to be Nixon better than Nixon. When the big victory is made when Nixon makes a reveal that even gets Frost ashock, Langella still manages to have a sensitivity and almost a sympathetic quality. Everyone else is quite good and welcome in their roles though they don't have the big arcs the other two get.I'd certainly rank the film as one of Howard's better films yet (I hate those quotes on case covers) and I'm hoping the film as a bit more of a staying power. A Beautiful Mind was a film I liked though didn't love and certainly wouldn't say Best Picture deserving but since I hadn't seen it in awhile I can't say as to how I'll view it tomorrow or 2 years from now. Frost/Nixon, a compelling work and actor showcase, can potentially be one of those films where it works for a long time or it works but then it just kind of...fades. But I will say that the film is definately worth a look.",5,Contenders fighting on your TV done right,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,3411,"['Ron', 'Howard', 'strange', 'way', 'kind', 'hit-or-miss', 'director', 'rarely', 'outright', 'bad', 'movie', 'are', 'well', 'work', 'not', 'as', 'successfully', 'others', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Cinderella', 'Man', 'times', 'can', 'fire', 'cylinders', 'Apollo', '13', 'Splash', 'underrated', 'Ransom', 'Frost/Nixon', 'sandwiched', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'followup', 'Angels', 'Demons', 'always', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'kind.After', 'Watergate', 'scandal', 'President', 'Nixon', 'presidency', 'America', 'want', 'apology', 'admission', 'wrongdoing', 'David', 'Frost', 'successful', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'shows', 'England', 'Australia', 'eye', 'interviews', 'Nixon', 'showing', 'full', 'reveal', 'time', 'office', 'mistakes', 'course', 'would', 'help', 'gain', 'notoreity', 'fame', 'being', 'somewhat', 'playboy', 'friendly', 'man', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'spotlight', 'Nixon', 'chance', 'redeem', 'least', 'let', 'people', 'see', 'side', 'try', 'make', 'more', 'favorable', 'media', 'country', 'What', 'are', 'series', 'interviews', 'where', 'have', 'war', 'words', 'fight', 'victory.It', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'boxing', 'parellels', 'film', 'title', 'made', 'look', 'marquee', 'matchup', 'headline', 'Nixon', 'running', 'place', 'obviously', 'meant', 'mirror', 'boxer', 'preparing', 'big', 'fight', 'Even', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'Nixon', 'advisor', 'boxing', 'analogy', 'good', 'match', 'quite', 'compelling', 'similar', 'way', 'Apollo', '13', 'just', 'exciting', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'outcome', 'actual', 'interviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'immediately', 'nice', 'buildup', 'bold', 'question', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'only', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'when', 'rebounded', 'highs', 'lows', 'match', 'are', 'right', 'here', 'underdog', 'one', 'blow', 'opponent', 'reeling', 'Heh', 'felt', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'better', 'job', 'interview-as-boxing-match', 'film', 'did', 'Cinderella', 'Man', 'actual', 'boxing', 'movie.Part', '2', 'main', 'actors', 'One', 'can', 'make', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'performance', 'more', 'flashier', 'always', 'smile', 'quite', 'big', 'might', 'add', 'not', 'lot', 'low', 'moments', 'one', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'full', 'weight', 'idea', 'grow', 'course', 'interviews', 'where', 'more', 'confident', 'major', 'highlight', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'sounding', 'man', 'be', 'Nixon', 'better', 'Nixon', 'When', 'big', 'victory', 'made', 'when', 'Nixon', 'reveal', 'even', 'Frost', 'ashock', 'Langella', 'still', 'have', 'sensitivity', 'almost', 'sympathetic', 'quality', 'Everyone', 'else', 'quite', 'good', 'welcome', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'arcs', 'other', 'two', 'get.I', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'rank', 'film', 'one', 'Howard', 'better', 'films', 'yet', 'hate', 'quotes', 'case', 'covers', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'staying', 'power', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'was', 'film', 'liked', 'though', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Best', 'Picture', 'deserving', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', ""'ll"", 'view', 'tomorrow', '2', 'years', 'now', 'Frost/Nixon', 'compelling', 'work', 'actor', 'showcase', 'can', 'potentially', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'long', 'time', 'then', 'just', 'kind', 'fades', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'definately', 'worth', 'look']",Frost/Nixon

It's available on DVD.  Nothing reproduced in Hollywood can replace true historical journalism.That being said, FROST/NIXON should at least spark interest in audiences who aren't quite familiar with the interviews (like myself).  The plot is fairly simple: British talk show host David Frost decides to get Richard Nixon to sit down with him for a series of interviews.  Everyone's dead-set against it, but Frost is determined to gain back his reputation, and Nixon is determined to gain a little money.Howard's direction is stellar, and the script is great, but the movie's true strength lies in its choice of actors.  Michael Sheen is terrific as Frost; we can almost ignore his UNDERWORLD roles.  He exudes charm and charisma and all the failings that go with tackling a superior foe.  Frank Langella as Nixon is simply fantastic; he creates a complex and sympathetic character.  Of the supporting cast, Kevin Bacon (as Nixon's loyal sidekick) and Sam Rockwell (as one of Frost's chief investigators) are the standouts.  Oliver Platt adds a bit of extra charm, as he does to every film.  However, of course, it's the two leads who draw the most attention, and deservedly so.

1236298,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B001TH92N4,Davewise,"[2, 2]","While there are some very good dramatic moments in the movie, to me it ultimately feels a little too drawn out. The original interviews might be important pieces of history, but do not make for a particularly good movie topic. The acting is very good, the important parts of the interviews are here, but there's too much material which feels repetitive and, at times, uninteresting.Frank Langella is very convincing as Nixon and Michael Sheen is great as David Frost. It's interesting to get some insight into why Frost decided to basically put everything on the line to do the interview. Nixon is portrayed the way one would expect, trying to maintain his legacy but ultimately still haunted by his mistakes. The supporting cast is good too, especially Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell as Frost's main researchers.The actual interviews make up a small portion of the movie. There is the drama surrounding them, including how the rest of the media sees Frost as just a talk show host and Frost's attempts at securing funding. Unfortunately, this is where the movie drags a little. With more than a few scenes depicting him on the phone or meeting with people to sell the idea, it felt repetitive. The reaction of the Frost's team and his subsequent behavior after the first two interviews felt the same.It all builds, somewhat slowly, to the last interview where we finally see the most dramatic moments. Watergate, the topic on everyone's mind, is covered in grand fashion. As seen in the extras, many of the lines from the final interview were taken straight from the original. While this ending was satisfying, I was still left feeling a little underwhelmed by the movie in general.

He was pardoned before there was even a trial or an arrest. To Americans who wanted accountability for what he had done, this was a mockery to their sense of justice.This is where our movie begins. David Frost is a comedian turned talk show host who has lost his program in New York, and resurrects himself in Australia. He is considered a light-weight, but he is also ambitious. He plans to interview disgraced President Richard M. Nixon, even though no major network will fund him or give him air time. Well played by Michael Sheen, he feels that this is one chance to remain in the limelight or he will sink into oblivion if the project fails.Richard Nixon, played by Frank Langella wishes to resurrect his career and move back East, and to prominence once again. Swifty Lazar, a public relations agent, played by Toby Jones, plays the seedy, vertically-challenged hustler for the president arranging the interview for a half-million dollars. This sets the stage for both men attempting to use each other to resurrect their careers.Each side has a team to coach the principals. Both sides know the four interviews are ""do or die."" Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan coaches Dick Nixon, and Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr., and Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick are pushing Frost to go harder on Nixon. Reston can almost taste the justice dripping from the camera, the justice he felt he had been denied, and the research he has found for Frost that is a bombshell. And you won't find out until the fourth interview in the movie, just as it happened in real life.The performances are intense without being overacted. Once in a while Frank Langella is allowed to demonstrate his acting range, and he stretches this one the furthest, turning in a superb performance of Nixon with his gestures, a face that grimaces with suspicion and emotion, and a voice that reminds us of Nixon. He appears a pathetic and deluded figure, who is intensely lonely and seeks vindication.The direction by Ron Howard is excellent, but Howard never quite achieves the status of others like Frank Capra, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, or David Lean. He doesn't with this one either, which makes it a great movie to watch but not a great movie to buy. One viewing should be enough to excite or remove your curiosity about an unprecedented event in American history. (Well, he never promised us a rose garden).I would recommend his next attempt be a look at the secrecy that permeated this last administration, an administration that did not trust the people but demanded  the people trust them.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","As a rule, I do not like the stellar Oliver Platt being underused, and worse, used for comic relief.Having got that off my barrel-chest, this is indeed a film not to be ignored, not to be missed.The story of the David Frost interviews of President Richard Nixon need no dead-horse-beating here; this film is the subject and it is a home run! Howard's finest work by far, and he's had some sagging box office lately.Frank Langella has always buried himself in roles. This film, as a study of Pres. Nixon's character and presence, could not have been played better by anyone on earth. When Oliver Stone picked Sir Anthony Hopkins to play Nixon, everyone laughed. It was a poor move. Dan Hedaya (""Dick"") was absolutely hilarious as a caricature. This film needed badly to avoid that ""Nixon Trap"".Langella is powerful, charismatic and as fearsome as Nixon could be in private--all the things not generally known about Nixon. One almost feels for Nixon thanks to Langella's terrific portrayal--and one almost falls for him too. Without nonsense, without strain, Langella IS Nixon here. It is this that makes the film, it is this detail that spreads like a canopy over the film and cannot be missed.The late-night call Nixon makes to Michael Sheen's Frost, while decent poetic license, is in fact the type of thing Nixon might have done anyway--it is in any event true to Nixon's character (and character flaws). It is a blast to see Nixon willing to come clean in the end, and his on-camera meltdown. Langella did it better than Nixon. In fact, Langella is a better Nixon than Nixon. Perhaps with this film people will lose this occasional obsession about Nixon's character.Michael Sheen is hard working, talented and my nerves are grated by him. I do not know what the hell it is or why, but I cannot say I'm such a great fan of his. He gets every note perfectly, and is passable as Frost, but he just rakes at my ears with his voice and frankly pisses me off with his eyes and smile. Sheen has an acting machine in him that seems to regurgitate the same character time and again. This film didn't miss the chance to nail Sheen: early on, he's on the phone with Nixon who regally slams the receiver down in Frost's ear. Funny, there's an IDENTICAL scene in ""The Queen"", with PM Blair getting an identical slam from Her Majesty. Sheen even rolls his eyes and purses his lips in exactly the same way.

However, audiences that normally would never watch a documentary about Watergate can enjoy this film. The Nixon/Frost interviews are not the obvious choice for a historical drama about Nixon (the Watergate scandal itself seems the more obvious choice, as in ""All the President's Men""). Yet, this film makes the run-up to the interview and the interview itself as dramatic as the best courtroom drama. By the time Nixon/Langella states that ""If the president does it, then it's not illegal"", the tension in the film is palpable.Langella (Nixon) and Sheen (Frost) give great performances. Langella comes across as suitably awkward and bitter (there is one great scene in which Nixon rants against the journalists and elites). This scene is reminiscent of Rick Perlstein's portrayal of a Nixon who divided the world into ""Franklins"" (elitists) and ""Orthogonians"" like Nixon (who came from poor backgrounds and were never liked). The guy even looks like Nixon! For his part, Sheen captures Frost well as light-hearted but also serious.As much as I liked the film, as other reviewers have noted it contains some glaring historical accuracies, for which I reduced the film's rating by a star. Normally, I can tolerate a few historical inaccuracies in in historical fiction, but ""Frost/Nixon"" goes a bit too far. At the end of the interview, the film has Nixon saying he ""was involved in a 'cover-up,' as you call it."" However, in the historical interview, Nixon actually said, ""You're wanting to me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No!"" That one change casts an enormously different light on the interview and Nixon. I worry that many people who watch the film may not be aware of the change and believe that Nixon actually admitted to wrongdoing.For viewers interested in the Nixon presidency and Watergate, be sure to check out:-All the President's Men (Two-Disc Special Edition)(the classic film about Watergate)- Rick Perlstein's new bookNixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America- and, of course, the actual Nixon-Frost interviews (available on youtube)",4,"Great movie, questionable history",1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2222,"['historical', 'fiction', 'film', 'wonderful', ""'m"", 'history', 'buff', 'love', 'seeing', 'critical', 'moments', 'history', 'dramatized', 'However', 'audiences', 'normally', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'documentary', 'Watergate', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Nixon/Frost', 'interviews', 'are', 'not', 'obvious', 'choice', 'historical', 'drama', 'Nixon', 'Watergate', 'scandal', 'more', 'obvious', 'choice', 'President', 'Men', 'film', 'run-up', 'interview', 'interview', 'as', 'dramatic', 'best', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'time', 'Nixon/Langella', 'president', 'then', 'not', 'illegal', 'tension', 'film', 'palpable.Langella', 'Nixon', 'Sheen', 'Frost', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'Langella', 'suitably', 'awkward', 'bitter', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'Nixon', 'rants', 'journalists', 'elites', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'Rick', 'Perlstein', 'portrayal', 'Nixon', 'who', 'divided', 'world', 'Franklins', 'elitists', 'Orthogonians', 'Nixon', 'who', 'came', 'poor', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'never', 'liked', 'guy', 'even', 'Nixon', 'part', 'Sheen', 'Frost', 'well', 'light-hearted', 'also', 'serious.As', 'much', 'liked', 'film', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'glaring', 'historical', 'accuracies', 'reduced', 'film', 'rating', 'star', 'Normally', 'can', 'tolerate', 'few', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'historical', 'fiction', 'Frost/Nixon', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'end', 'interview', 'film', 'Nixon', 'saying', 'was', 'involved', ""'cover-up"", 'call', 'However', 'historical', 'interview', 'Nixon', 'actually', 'said', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'say', 'participated', 'illegal', 'cover-up', 'No', 'one', 'change', 'enormously', 'different', 'light', 'interview', 'Nixon', 'worry', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'change', 'believe', 'Nixon', 'actually', 'admitted', 'wrongdoing.For', 'viewers', 'interested', 'Nixon', 'presidency', 'Watergate', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', '-All', 'President', 'Men', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'classic', 'film', 'Watergate', 'Rick', 'Perlstein', 'new', 'bookNixonland', 'Rise', 'President', 'Fracturing', 'America-', 'course', 'actual', 'Nixon-Frost', 'interviews', 'available', 'youtube']",Frost/Nixon
1236309,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B001TH92N4,e. verrillo,"[5, 5]","Frost/Nixon is a David and Goliath story. David Frost, a talk show host who started his professional life as a satirist, decides to take on the champion of chicanery, ""Tricky Dick,"" in a round of interviews that may finally extract a confession of complicity in the Watergate cover-up. To do it justice, the film is an absolute marvel. Frank Langella does a truly gorgeous performance as a Nixon ""ravaged"" by the weight of his own political isolation and ultimate complicity in a crime. And Michael Sheen, as David Frost, is perfect as the man hovering on the edge of bankruptcy, personal failure, and professional ridicule. Although the beginning of the film was rather slow, the build-up to the final interview was fraught with an almost unbearable tension. It was, in every respect, an enthralling, revealing and beautifully enacted film. The fact that it did not correspond with what I remembered of Nixon hardly lessened its impact. However, it did raise a question: Was Ron Howard's film true?After watching the original interviews (which I highly recommend), I have come to the conclusion that ""yes"", the film was true, and ""no"" it wasn't. What is clear from the Frost Nixon interviews filmed in 1977 is that they are also a David and Goliath story, but with the roles reversed. Frost--self-possessed, confident, and completely unrelenting--is not David, but Goliath. It is Richard Nixon--squirming like a worm on a hook, stammering, and wiping his upper lip--who comes up short. Far from Langella's poised and deadly Nixon, the real man comes across as the underhanded crook he really was, avoiding every question with obfuscations and double-talk, passing the blame onto anybody and everybody else, blathering nonsense about ""tulips"" that had ""just come out,"" indulging in his famous self-pity (Haldeman wept, Ehrlichman wept, Patricia wept, everybody wept). At no time during the interviews did Nixon ever admit to having been involved in a cover-up. And when he finally admitted that he had let the American people down he did not say ""but worst of all, I let down our system of government."" While he did admit that he let down our system of government, ""worst of all"" for the real Nixon was that he ""let down an opportunity that [he] would have had to build peace in the Middle East."" In short, he misssed the chance to pat himself on the back. Richard Nixon was self-serving to the bitter end. He was a man who didn't have an ethical bone in his body, much less a conscience.So, in what way was this film accurate? Except for the obvious conjectures (the phone call Frost receives in the middle of the night from Nixon, for example), and some liberties with the interviews (condensations, some rewording, and, of course, the invention of a confession) it was true in spirit. For in the broader sense, this film was a Shakespearean-style morality play about the abuse of power. In that sense it was completely true, for not only does power corrupt, it tends to draw the corrupt to it. Nixon's statement that ""When the president does [something], that means that it is not illegal"" is what lies at the heart of this film. We have had imperial presidents before Nixon, and have certainly had one since, but nowhere will you see a more chilling statement of Divine Right than in the Frost Nixon interviews.",5,Superb film ...but how accurate is it?,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,3315,"['Frost/Nixon', 'David', 'Goliath', 'story', 'David', 'Frost', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'who', 'started', 'professional', 'life', 'satirist', 'take', 'champion', 'chicanery', 'Tricky', 'Dick', 'round', 'interviews', 'may', 'finally', 'extract', 'confession', 'complicity', 'Watergate', 'cover-up', 'do', 'justice', 'film', 'absolute', 'marvel', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'truly', 'gorgeous', 'performance', 'Nixon', 'ravaged', 'weight', 'own', 'political', 'isolation', 'ultimate', 'complicity', 'crime', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'David', 'Frost', 'perfect', 'man', 'hovering', 'edge', 'bankruptcy', 'personal', 'failure', 'professional', 'ridicule', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'rather', 'slow', 'build-up', 'final', 'interview', 'was', 'fraught', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'tension', 'was', 'respect', 'enthralling', 'revealing', 'beautifully', 'enacted', 'film', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'correspond', 'what', 'remembered', 'Nixon', 'hardly', 'lessened', 'impact', 'However', 'did', 'raise', 'question', 'Was', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'film', 'true', 'watching', 'original', 'interviews', 'highly', 'recommend', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'yes', 'film', 'was', 'true', 'was', ""n't"", 'What', 'clear', 'Frost', 'Nixon', 'interviews', 'filmed', '1977', 'are', 'also', 'David', 'Goliath', 'story', 'roles', 'reversed', 'Frost', 'self-possessed', 'confident', 'completely', 'unrelenting', 'not', 'David', 'Goliath', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'squirming', 'worm', 'hook', 'stammering', 'wiping', 'upper', 'lip', 'who', 'up', 'short', 'Far', 'Langella', 'poised', 'deadly', 'Nixon', 'real', 'man', 'underhanded', 'crook', 'really', 'was', 'avoiding', 'question', 'obfuscations', 'double-talk', 'passing', 'blame', 'anybody', 'everybody', 'else', 'blathering', 'nonsense', 'tulips', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'indulging', 'famous', 'self-pity', 'Haldeman', 'wept', 'Ehrlichman', 'wept', 'Patricia', 'wept', 'everybody', 'wept', 'time', 'interviews', 'did', 'Nixon', 'ever', 'admit', 'having', 'been', 'involved', 'cover-up', 'when', 'finally', 'admitted', 'had', 'let', 'American', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'say', 'worst', 'let', 'down', 'system', 'government', 'did', 'admit', 'let', 'down', 'system', 'government', 'worst', 'real', 'Nixon', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'opportunity', ']', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'build', 'peace', 'Middle', 'East', 'short', 'misssed', 'chance', 'pat', 'back', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'was', 'self-serving', 'bitter', 'end', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'ethical', 'bone', 'body', 'much', 'less', 'conscience.So', 'what', 'way', 'was', 'film', 'accurate', 'obvious', 'conjectures', 'phone', 'call', 'Frost', 'middle', 'night', 'Nixon', 'example', 'liberties', 'interviews', 'condensations', 'rewording', 'course', 'invention', 'confession', 'was', 'true', 'spirit', 'broader', 'sense', 'film', 'was', 'Shakespearean-style', 'morality', 'play', 'abuse', 'power', 'sense', 'was', 'completely', 'true', 'not', 'only', 'power', 'corrupt', 'draw', 'corrupt', 'Nixon', 'statement', 'When', 'president', '[', 'something', ']', 'not', 'illegal', 'what', 'heart', 'film', 'have', 'had', 'imperial', 'presidents', 'Nixon', 'have', 'certainly', 'had', 'one', 'nowhere', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'chilling', 'statement', 'Divine', 'Right', 'Frost', 'Nixon', 'interviews']",Frost/Nixon
1236310,A1PN3R8DXRQ1C3,B001TH92N4,Gary Malone,"[16, 38]","Consider the pedigree of the movie ""Frost/Nixon"": this is a film which is based on a play which is based on a TV interview. Here's why no straight thing could ever have been carved from such crooked timber:Film and television are usually at their cheesiest when they cross over. When even a successful film produces a spin-off TV show, the result is usually of very poor quality. (Examples: ""Fame"", ""Ferris Bueller"", ""In the Heat of the Night"".) Worse, when Hollywood is truly stuck for ideas, the spin-off goes in the other direction: ""Charlie's Angels"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Dukes of Hazzard"" are all dreadful films based on poor TV shows. ""Frost/Nixon"" is off to a bad start straight away because (i) the original material is not a TV show but merely a TV interview, and (ii) even that's been put through the strainer of being converted into a play.What's that, I hear you object? ""But the TV interview was real. And it was real in a way that `Dukes of Hazzard' could never be."" I absolutely agree. So why wouldn't we just go and watch the *actual* TV interview, and not this twice-diluted recreation of it? This is the central problem with ""Frost/Nixon: the movie"". It never overcomes its own pointlessness. Its redundancy seeps through in every frame. Anyone who wants to find out what actually happened in this famous interview could simply go to the source material. It certainly contains dramatic moments. Why would anyone want to *re*-dramatize it?Well, the answer, apparently, is that the movie can offer us something that the real interview can't. And here it is: we get to see the dramatic story of what happened behind the scenes. That is to say, we see two things: (i) Frost's attempts to get his TV show financed; and (ii) the manoeuvrings of both Frost's staff and Nixon's, focusing mainly of the research efforts of Frost's. So - if we grant that the reproduction of the interview itself is redundant, then we are left with a movie about researching and financing. Who wouldn't dash off to see that?In fact, the filmmakers themselves seem quite conscious of the unexciting nature of the leftovers they have been lumbered with. There are constant efforts throughout to inject `dramatic' moments:1. Witness David Frost reaching for a glass of water. (The close-up movement of his arm is filmed in slow motion while tense music underscores the significance of the moment.)2. Watch as Nixon's team and Frost's team line up and eye each other across the living room. If this were a hushed saloon, there could easily be a gunfight. (Except that it's not and therefore there won't be.)3. Listen as Kevin Bacon compares the opening sentences of the interview to the first punches in a prize-fight. Meanwhile the actor playing his counterpart on Frost's team declares: `It was horrifying ... just horrifying!'4. Take note as Frost is counselled by his staff to `Never forget ... you are in there with a *major* operator.'5. Whistle at the close-up of Frost going for broke by flinging his clipboard of questions onto the floor (which didn't happen in the real interview).6. Listen as Nixon growls down the phone to Frost: `I shall be your fiercest adversary ... when the time comes, I'm going to be focused and ready for battle.' (Of course, the confrontation took place in a pair of armchairs, so as epic battles go, it's hardly Stalingrad.)Scenes in the movie are interspersed with post-interview interviews with the staff on both Frost and Nixon's team. But wait. Those interviews weren't with real people. They were with the actors, who continued to play real people. This supposedly `clever' device for adding extra drama falls on its face because there are only two possibilities here: either the real Frost-Nixon staff never said these words on camera, in which case the filmmakers of ""Frost/Nixon"" are just making it up; or else they did say these words on camera, in which case - again - why wouldn't we be looking at the original footage? Isn't this just more redundancy? (And in case anyone thinks that intercutting real interviews into a movie is too incongruent, recall that Warren Beatty's film ""Reds"" won a Best Picture Oscar while using precisely this approach.)It's painful watching a film like ""Frost/Nixon"" which is so gravid with its own self-importance, and yet at the same time so encumbered by its own emptiness. At the close of the film a character speaks the following astonishing verdict to camera:""The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten: in time, they would totally cease to exist.""Really? One wonders where to begin with this remarkably incautious statement. Should a major media event's failings be allowed to be airbushed from our collective memory? If so, what does that say about the supposedly ever-vigilant media itself? And, if one recalls Orwell, this precept - that an event which is forgotten about is one which has ceased to exist - was a totalitarian principle.So if we are prepared to admit that the Nixon interview hardly achieved anything, why make a movie which so plainly tries to confect it as some sort of triumph? (By the movie's own admission, Frost failed in three out of the four sessions.) The film - sure enough - ends with nothing more than the `satisfaction' of the nation seeing of a guilty-looking Nixon. He didn't look guilty before? And isn't it fair to say that a guilty person always comes across looking morally better for having admitted guilt than having refused to? The film seems to have missed its own point here: how do we know that the negative image of a guilty Nixon was not drowned out by the more perniciously humanising image of a contrite and anguished Nixon? If that's a win, it's pretty thin.In a famous book published in 1960, the American historian Daniel J. Boorstin wrote of the increasing (and damaging) dominance in American culture of what he called the ""pseudo-event"". He meant, among other things, that newspapers and other media were beginning to report on things which were not substantial occurrences. He listed four criteria which defined a pseudo-event. Here's number one:""It is not spontaneous, but comes about because someone has planned, planted or incited it. Typically it is not a train wreck or an earthquake, but an interview.""[Boorstin, ""The Image, or What Happened to the American Dream"", Antheneum, New York, 1962, p. 11]So here is the plain truth. The Vietnam War was an event. The Watergate Scandal was an event. But David Frost's interview with Richard Nixon was not an event: rather, it was a footnote to events. Making a movie of a play based on this subject matter meant creating a footnote to a footnote to a footnote ... except that herein the filmmakers were desperately trying to persuade us that the interview *was* an earthquake.So - what next? Will a superstructure of absent dramatic tension and no historical significance be erected around ... ""Couric/Palin""?

1236311,A2ONZPPQ93TPQ9,B001TH92N4,Gena Chereck,"[0, 0]","But personally, I think it's great that he wouldn't take on this adaptation of Peter Morgan's Tony-nominated play Frost/Nixon -- which I had always thought sounded cool, but never had a chance in hell of catching in London or on Broadway -- unless its stars, Frank Langella (a fine character actor from such films as Good Night and Good Luck) and Michael Sheen (whom I adored as Prime Minister Tony Blair in The Queen, which was also written by Morgan), were allowed to re-create their respective roles as disgraced ex-President Richard Milhous Nixon and British TV personality David Frost for the big screen. Though not a powerhouse epic like Oliver Stone's Nixon (1995), there's something to be said for a solid, modest piece of old-fashioned craftsmanship.This film's first hour, covering the lengthy period of dealmaking and preparations that led Frost to tape a series of four syndicated TV interviews with Nixon in March 1977, weaves an intriguing web of differing agendas and motivations among its characters: Frost learns of Nixon's 1974 resignation in the wake of the Watergate scandal and, longing to boost his career and be taken more seriously, hopes to score a ratings-bonanza interview with him; his producer pal, John Birt (Matthew MacFadyen), expresses doubts but lends support anyway; Nixon decides to participate after learning that Frost will be paying him good money; Nixon's loyal chief of staff, Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) encourages him further, believing that Frost will be just a lightweight with ""puffball"" questions, and that Nixon can easily use the opportunity to repair his public image; and when Frost hires author/professor James Reston, Jr. (chameleonic Sam Rockwell) and TV newsman Bob Zelnick (lively scene-stealer Oliver Platt) to assist him with research, Reston's furious desire to ""give Richard Nixon the trial he never had"" makes Birt understandably nervous, while Frost is rather moved by the man's passion.In the second hour, the sparks really start to fly, not only before the cameras, but behind the scenes as well: Zelnick and Reston lay into Frost for not being forceful enough with Nixon at first, have little patience for Frost's jet-set playboy lifestyle, and dismiss him as a mere ""talk-show host""; Frost, already losing confidence in his abilities as a journalist, learns he may be jeopardizing his own career back home; and Brennan, fearing that questions about Watergate and the Vietnam War will hurt Nixon's reputation even more, becomes fiercely protective of Nixon -- to the point of trying to interfere with Frost.The story climaxes with Nixon drunk-dialing Frost not long before the last taping -- pure conjecture on the part of the screenwriter, but the phone call is such a great character-revealing moment (suggesting that the two are kindred spirits, men from humble beginnings who must work extra hard to prove their worth in a society that looks down on them) that I can't imagine the film working without it. Langella, completely disappearing into his role, does a commendable job of humanizing the often-vilified Nixon, and Sheen is a revelation, tapping into Frost's hidden sadness and insecurity as he tries to put his best face forward and enjoy the perks of his celebrity status; both actors, rather than playing to the back row as they most likely would have on-stage, wisely scale down their performances for the intimacy of film (indeed, the power of the close-up proves to be a major point in this story).In this day and age, with presidential candidates and other politicians often turning up on programs like The Daily Show With Jon Stewart, Late Night With David Letterman, and Saturday Night Live, it seems almost quaint that the televised Nixon interviews were seen as such a big deal. Ultimately, this film is uniformly well-acted, witty (a scene in which Platt does an impression of Langella-as-Nixon is especially priceless), and a fascinating exploration of the growing relationship between showbiz and politics.",5,Say what you will about director Ron Howard...,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,3995,"['personally', 'think', 'great', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'adaptation', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'Tony-nominated', 'play', 'Frost/Nixon', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'sounded', 'cool', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'hell', 'catching', 'London', 'Broadway', 'stars', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'fine', 'character', 'actor', 'such', 'films', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'whom', 'adored', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Queen', 'was', 'also', 'written', 'Morgan', 'were', 'allowed', 're-create', 'respective', 'roles', 'disgraced', 'ex-President', 'Richard', 'Milhous', 'Nixon', 'British', 'TV', 'personality', 'David', 'Frost', 'big', 'screen', 'not', 'powerhouse', 'epic', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Nixon', '1995', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'solid', 'modest', 'piece', 'old-fashioned', 'craftsmanship.This', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'covering', 'lengthy', 'period', 'dealmaking', 'preparations', 'led', 'Frost', 'tape', 'series', 'four', 'syndicated', 'TV', 'interviews', 'Nixon', 'March', '1977', 'intriguing', 'web', 'differing', 'agendas', 'motivations', 'characters', 'Frost', 'learns', 'Nixon', '1974', 'resignation', 'wake', 'Watergate', 'scandal', 'longing', 'boost', 'career', 'be', 'taken', 'more', 'seriously', 'score', 'ratings-bonanza', 'interview', 'producer', 'pal', 'John', 'Birt', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'doubts', 'support', 'anyway', 'Nixon', 'participate', 'learning', 'Frost', 'will', 'be', 'paying', 'good', 'money', 'Nixon', 'loyal', 'chief', 'staff', 'Jack', 'Brennan', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'further', 'believing', 'Frost', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'lightweight', 'puffball', 'questions', 'Nixon', 'can', 'easily', 'use', 'opportunity', 'repair', 'public', 'image', 'when', 'Frost', 'author/professor', 'James', 'Reston', 'Jr.', 'chameleonic', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'TV', 'newsman', 'Bob', 'Zelnick', 'lively', 'scene-stealer', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'assist', 'research', 'Reston', 'furious', 'desire', 'give', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'trial', 'never', 'had', 'Birt', 'understandably', 'nervous', 'Frost', 'rather', 'moved', 'man', 'passion.In', 'second', 'hour', 'sparks', 'really', 'start', 'fly', 'not', 'only', 'cameras', 'scenes', 'well', 'Zelnick', 'Reston', 'lay', 'Frost', 'not', 'being', 'forceful', 'enough', 'Nixon', 'first', 'have', 'little', 'patience', 'Frost', 'jet-set', 'playboy', 'lifestyle', 'dismiss', 'mere', 'talk-show', 'host', 'Frost', 'already', 'losing', 'confidence', 'abilities', 'journalist', 'may', 'be', 'jeopardizing', 'own', 'career', 'back', 'home', 'Brennan', 'fearing', 'questions', 'Watergate', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'will', 'hurt', 'Nixon', 'reputation', 'even', 'more', 'fiercely', 'protective', 'Nixon', 'point', 'trying', 'interfere', 'Frost.The', 'story', 'climaxes', 'Nixon', 'drunk-dialing', 'Frost', 'not', 'long', 'last', 'taping', 'pure', 'conjecture', 'part', 'screenwriter', 'phone', 'call', 'such', 'great', 'character-revealing', 'moment', 'suggesting', 'two', 'are', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'men', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'who', 'must', 'work', 'extra', 'hard', 'prove', 'worth', 'society', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'film', 'working', 'Langella', 'completely', 'disappearing', 'role', 'commendable', 'job', 'humanizing', 'often-vilified', 'Nixon', 'Sheen', 'revelation', 'tapping', 'Frost', 'hidden', 'sadness', 'insecurity', 'put', 'best', 'face', 'forward', 'enjoy', 'perks', 'celebrity', 'status', 'actors', 'rather', 'playing', 'back', 'row', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'on-stage', 'wisely', 'scale', 'down', 'performances', 'intimacy', 'film', 'indeed', 'power', 'close-up', 'proves', 'be', 'major', 'point', 'story', 'day', 'age', 'presidential', 'candidates', 'other', 'politicians', 'often', 'turning', 'up', 'programs', 'Daily', 'Show', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'Late', 'Night', 'David', 'Letterman', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'almost', 'quaint', 'televised', 'Nixon', 'interviews', 'were', 'seen', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'uniformly', 'well-acted', 'witty', 'scene', 'Platt', 'impression', 'Langella-as-Nixon', 'especially', 'priceless', 'fascinating', 'exploration', 'growing', 'relationship', 'showbiz', 'politics']",Frost/Nixon

1236315,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001TH92N4,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","FROST/NIXON is one of the most successful screen adaptations of a play yet made.  Perhaps that is due in part to the fact that the popular stage play by Peter Morgan was revised for the screen by the playwright, but it is also to the credit of director Ron Howard who managed to suffuse the 'play as movie' with such atmosphere and feeling of spontaneity that the rather long movie seems to whisk by more rapidly than history!Everyone knows of the infamous David Frost interview with Richard Nixon after Nixon had resigned office and was living in semi-seclusion in San Clemente, California, a bitter man struggling with the demons not only from the recent past but also from his childhood.  Frost took on the challenge to bring the perpetrator of the Watergate scandal to his knees to satisfy the American public's need for retribution, and in conducting these interviews he did indeed achieve that.  The story is as much a character study of Frost as it is of Nixon and the parallels writer Morgan uncovers makes the film far more than a quasi-documentary.  This is real drama played for all it's worth.Frank Langella is unforgettable in his portrayal of Nixon as is Michael Sheen as Frost, each actor having played the roles on Broadway and transferring that depth of understanding to the screen. The surprise in this film is the use of the peripheral cast of characters - Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, Matthew Macfadyen, and Toby Jones - a group of actors who light the darker corners of the story with aplomb.FROST/NIXON should be required viewing for every Political Science major in our schools - and hopefully will urge the nation to find a similar manner to bring closure to the strangely coincidental machinations of the recent Bush administration crimes.

Paul Moon,"[2, 5]","Just before the mainstream conglomerate media let loose their dynastic praise on Frost/Nixon, a big studio picture directed by one of that machine's favorite sons Opie, I had the special privilege of previewing this stage adaptation just on the heels of seeing its Kennedy Center run, with all the curiosities that attend contrasting live theatre under a proscenium, against the meticulously edited medium of cinema where Nixon's famous beads of sweat are literally inches large - an intimacy that ironically amounts to smaller realism. (It is another evening at the movies followed by almost twenty minutes on the board for the next Orange Line train, so here comes another session of twiddling.)When leaving the live production, I remember feeling (in agreement with my father who attended with me) that the playwright's conception was better suited for the movie medium. Some reasons are obvious, foremost the fact that the actual deus ex machina here is not something archetypal like gods and monsters you would nest above the stage, but rather the artifice of moving-picture interviews. You also have the simple fact that the playwright has found his most success as a screenwriter (e.g., U.K.'s ""The Queen""). Moreover, the way that his actors address the audience from the stage is a combination of patronizing backstory and inelegant theatricalism (i.e., a device that comfits formalism and not this cocky contemporary milieu).On the other hand, this is not a masterful motion picture. Ron Howard has never been more than a competent, conventional filmmaker, and this prt-&agrave;-porter project is no exception. Straight out of first-year film school (a class that Mr. Howard probably just audited), you can easily anticipate the tactic of verit&eacute; camerawork coming on with all the grace and freshness of Grandpa's favorite joke. And the film's convenience of relating backstory through journalistic interviews does not improve upon the play's primary fault of inelegant theatricalism.But there is an extraordinary payoff in the film's final shot, a true literary d&eacute;nouement, and by describing it here I give nothing away, only cue the moment for you specially to relish. In the play and screenplay, one current in the brinksmanship between Frost and Nixon is the President's grumbling about how Frost's Italian loafers are effeminate - ""real men wear laces,"" says Nixon's right-hand military man. At the end of the film, Frost delivers Nixon a present, those same loafers. The parting shot - a beauty so proprietary to the language of cinema - is of Nixon against a fiery sunset, left alone again in his terrible loneliness, peering out into the ocean with that brand new pair of loafers planted onto the rail of his veranda. Prominent in the lore of Richard Nixon is an anecdote contained not by words, but a photograph - we see the Quaker walking in the sand of his San Clemente shore with his shoes on. From time to time, moments like these solidify my grown understanding of how Art can be infinitely more efficient, tasteful and even intellectual than the most carefully polished treatises. Even when these glimpses into enlightenment come sparingly, they make it all worthwhile. You can spend two hours in stadium seating surrounded by popcorn chomps, but something that lasts less than a minute occupies your mind and your spirit for so many more hours.",3,"Nothing exceptional, but better suited for film than the stage play",1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,3382,"['Just', 'mainstream', 'conglomerate', 'media', 'let', 'loose', 'dynastic', 'praise', 'Frost/Nixon', 'big', 'studio', 'picture', 'directed', 'one', 'machine', 'favorite', 'sons', 'Opie', 'had', 'special', 'privilege', 'previewing', 'stage', 'adaptation', 'just', 'heels', 'seeing', 'Kennedy', 'Center', 'run', 'curiosities', 'attend', 'contrasting', 'live', 'theatre', 'proscenium', 'meticulously', 'edited', 'medium', 'cinema', 'where', 'Nixon', 'famous', 'beads', 'sweat', 'are', 'literally', 'inches', 'large', 'intimacy', 'ironically', 'smaller', 'realism', 'evening', 'movies', 'followed', 'almost', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'board', 'next', 'Orange', 'Line', 'train', 'so', 'here', 'session', 'twiddling', 'When', 'leaving', 'live', 'production', 'remember', 'feeling', 'agreement', 'father', 'who', 'attended', 'playwright', 'conception', 'was', 'better', 'suited', 'movie', 'medium', 'reasons', 'are', 'obvious', 'foremost', 'fact', 'actual', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'here', 'not', 'something', 'archetypal', 'gods', 'monsters', 'would', 'nest', 'stage', 'rather', 'artifice', 'moving-picture', 'interviews', 'also', 'have', 'simple', 'fact', 'playwright', 'found', 'most', 'success', 'screenwriter', 'e.g.', 'U.K.', 'Queen', 'Moreover', 'way', 'actors', 'address', 'audience', 'stage', 'combination', 'patronizing', 'backstory', 'inelegant', 'theatricalism', 'i.e.', 'device', 'formalism', 'not', 'cocky', 'contemporary', 'milieu', '.On', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'masterful', 'motion', 'picture', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'competent', 'conventional', 'filmmaker', 'prt-', 'agrave', '-porter', 'project', 'exception', 'Straight', 'first-year', 'film', 'school', 'class', 'Mr.', 'Howard', 'probably', 'just', 'audited', 'can', 'easily', 'anticipate', 'tactic', 'verit', 'eacute', 'camerawork', 'coming', 'grace', 'freshness', 'Grandpa', 'favorite', 'joke', 'film', 'convenience', 'relating', 'backstory', 'journalistic', 'interviews', 'not', 'improve', 'play', 'primary', 'fault', 'inelegant', 'theatricalism.But', 'extraordinary', 'payoff', 'film', 'final', 'shot', 'true', 'literary', 'd', 'eacute', 'describing', 'here', 'give', 'nothing', 'away', 'only', 'moment', 'specially', 'relish', 'play', 'screenplay', 'one', 'current', 'brinksmanship', 'Frost', 'Nixon', 'President', 'grumbling', 'how', 'Frost', 'Italian', 'loafers', 'are', 'effeminate', 'real', 'men', 'wear', 'laces', 'Nixon', 'right-hand', 'military', 'man', 'end', 'film', 'Frost', 'delivers', 'Nixon', 'present', 'same', 'loafers', 'parting', 'shot', 'beauty', 'so', 'proprietary', 'language', 'cinema', 'Nixon', 'fiery', 'sunset', 'left', 'alone', 'again', 'terrible', 'loneliness', 'peering', 'out', 'ocean', 'brand', 'new', 'pair', 'loafers', 'planted', 'rail', 'veranda', 'Prominent', 'lore', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'anecdote', 'contained', 'not', 'words', 'photograph', 'see', 'Quaker', 'walking', 'sand', 'San', 'Clemente', 'shore', 'shoes', 'time', 'time', 'moments', 'solidify', 'grown', 'understanding', 'how', 'Art', 'can', 'be', 'infinitely', 'more', 'efficient', 'tasteful', 'even', 'intellectual', 'most', 'carefully', 'polished', 'treatises', 'Even', 'when', 'glimpses', 'enlightenment', 'come', 'sparingly', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'can', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'stadium', 'seating', 'surrounded', 'popcorn', 'chomps', 'something', 'less', 'minute', 'occupies', 'mind', 'spirit', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'hours']",Frost/Nixon

That category is in this case docu-drama. It is and will always remain a controversial category. After all, what is ""truth"" when set in a historical context? I think this film's greatest achievement lies in its portrayal of Richard Nixon (played - I can't really use the word in any normal sense here - by Frank Langella) not as a man to be hated or despised, but as one to be pitied in the truest and most loving sense of the word.This film stands alongside the great tragedies of Shakespeare and Aeschylus as an account of the downfall of a gifted human being, tragically flawed.

Today, he is known as Sir David Frost. Nixon is shown as a man with a multitude of faults, including: an inability to make small talk (he asked Frost: ""Did you fornicate last night?""), a bigot (making a disparaging remark about blacks), and a misunderstanding of common things (he thought that only effeminate men wore loafers).

1236321,AVH1BRTLRS38M,B001TH92N4,"Jackie Chan ""Alberto""","[1, 1]","The descriptions of other contributors offer ample information concerning the contents and direction that this film takes.  The pace and economy of the film are accurate enough to be convincing, relative to the actual interviews, and the film does offer something of the drama contained in the actual interviews themselves.  The most nagging thing about this film is the feeling I got from it concerning the sincerity of Nixon's admission of wrong-doing.  The film made me start to think that Nixon's view of domestic affairs played second fiddle to his foreign policy.  I got the sense that maybe the Vietnam war and Cambodia were necessary in order to provide the US, and Nixon, with the credibility to act as arbiter in the political conflict between the Soviet Union and China.  Nixon always said that it was to be a 'contained' war, and he was very appeasing to criticisms of it long after the fact. This doesn't square with his escalation of the conflict at the time.  His presidential pardon seemed too convenient to answer the Watergate scandal.  I wonder if it was unspoken US policy not to win the war but instead to agitate the political concept of communism to show US self-interest as anti-communist.  The killing of masses of civilians was a demonstration of commitment to this agitation, one that would resonate globally.  This may have convinced both the Chinese and the Russians that the US and Nixon, uninterested in a positive program of communism, could provide the most appropriate mitigation of their own ever increasing and aggressive differences, and possibly help prevent them from going to war with each other. This film put doubts into my mind about the sincerity of Nixon's declaration of wrong-doing but a willingness to admit to wrong doing perhaps to deflect attention to other, more urgent aspects of his policy. He was pardoned, he got wealthy, and he broke the law, there must have been something significant enough for him to take the fall, while also needing to remain secret. It can only have had to do with using the war in Vietnam as credibility to prevent a superpower war between China and Russia that may have been more costly.",4,What are its implications,1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,2169,"['descriptions', 'other', 'contributors', 'offer', 'ample', 'information', 'concerning', 'contents', 'direction', 'film', 'pace', 'economy', 'film', 'are', 'accurate', 'enough', 'be', 'convincing', 'relative', 'actual', 'interviews', 'film', 'offer', 'something', 'drama', 'contained', 'actual', 'interviews', 'most', 'nagging', 'thing', 'film', 'feeling', 'got', 'concerning', 'sincerity', 'Nixon', 'admission', 'wrong-doing', 'film', 'made', 'start', 'think', 'Nixon', 'view', 'domestic', 'affairs', 'played', 'second', 'fiddle', 'foreign', 'policy', 'got', 'sense', 'maybe', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Cambodia', 'were', 'necessary', 'order', 'provide', 'US', 'Nixon', 'credibility', 'act', 'arbiter', 'political', 'conflict', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'China', 'Nixon', 'always', 'said', 'was', 'be', ""'contained"", 'war', 'was', 'very', 'appeasing', 'criticisms', 'long', 'fact', ""n't"", 'square', 'escalation', 'conflict', 'time', 'presidential', 'pardon', 'seemed', 'too', 'convenient', 'answer', 'Watergate', 'scandal', 'wonder', 'was', 'unspoken', 'US', 'policy', 'not', 'win', 'war', 'instead', 'agitate', 'political', 'concept', 'communism', 'show', 'US', 'self-interest', 'anti-communist', 'killing', 'masses', 'civilians', 'was', 'demonstration', 'commitment', 'agitation', 'one', 'would', 'resonate', 'globally', 'may', 'have', 'convinced', 'Chinese', 'Russians', 'US', 'Nixon', 'uninterested', 'positive', 'program', 'communism', 'could', 'provide', 'most', 'appropriate', 'mitigation', 'own', 'ever', 'increasing', 'aggressive', 'differences', 'possibly', 'help', 'prevent', 'going', 'war', 'other', 'film', 'put', 'doubts', 'mind', 'sincerity', 'Nixon', 'declaration', 'wrong-doing', 'willingness', 'admit', 'wrong', 'doing', 'perhaps', 'deflect', 'attention', 'other', 'more', 'urgent', 'aspects', 'policy', 'was', 'pardoned', 'got', 'wealthy', 'broke', 'law', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'significant', 'enough', 'take', 'fall', 'also', 'needing', 'remain', 'secret', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'had', 'do', 'using', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'credibility', 'prevent', 'superpower', 'war', 'China', 'Russia', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'costly']",Frost/Nixon

1236323,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B001TH92N4,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[43, 46]","""Frost/Nixon is a riveting historical drama, based on the play by Peter Morgan. Morgan wrote the movie's screenplay, as well as screenplays for ""The Queen,"" and ""The Last King of Scotland."" The controversial 1977 Frost/Nixon interviews are dramatized here, and Frank Langella's superb performance as the disgraced former president, Richard M. Nixon, is worth the price of a movie rental alone.Richard Nixon resigned from the office of the presidency on August 9, 1974, rather than face impeachment by Congress for his role in the Watergate scandal, and subsequent events. He was the only US president  ever to do so. The film shows real footage of the Nixon family, leaving the White House and boarding a helicopter - the first step in a journey which will take Mr. Nixon into exile.David Frost, (Michael Sheen), a British celebrity talk show host, watches this event on television and decides that an interview with Nixon would be just the thing to relaunch his waning career. He pursues the project for some time and winds up financing it out of his own pocket, while searching desperately for backers. Creepy literary agent Irving ""Swifty"" Lazar, (Toby Jones), negotiates the deal. Nixon agrees to do more than 20 hours of on-camera interviews with Frost, and will receive $1 million or more in fees and profits for the sessions. He is in serious debt. He has huge legal bills and back taxes to pay and needs the money. Under the terms of the contract, Nixon will have no control over content of questions or editing, and will not see any of the questions in advance. Of course, he can always refuse to answer questions, but he will have to do so in front of a huge audience.Frost is a most incongruous choice for interviewer, as he has no journalistic experience and is known for being an entertainer and playboy. Yet he manages to upstage major TV networks with their top-notch interviewers, like Mike Wallace, Walter Cronkite, and David Brinkley, and get the gig. Nixon, after almost three years of silence, out of the public eye at his home in California, looks to the series of interviews as an opportunity to vindicate himself and resurrect his very tarnished image. He believes that Frost, a lightweight, will not ask the tough questions, and allow him to forward his own version of his time in office and Watergate.Frost brings British John Birt, (Matthew Macfadyen), with him to California, to direct the production. They hire radical researcher James Reston, Jr., (Sam Rockwell), who wants Frost to play hardball and try Nixon in the public eye. TV producer Bob Zelnick, (Oliver Platt), signs onto the project also. Caroline Cushing, (Rebecca Hall), Frost's gorgeous girlfriend, accompanies the team. Nixon takes note of her beauty on several occasions. He rattles Frost, before the beginning of one session, by asking if ""he had done any fornicating"" the night before. I have never known anyone else who is capable of using such terrible language, frequently, and remain in a formal stance while doing so. However you look at him, RMN is a very formal man...he never looks relaxed - in real life or as played by Mr. Langella.Nixon has his own team. US Marine officer Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon), a Vietnam veteran, is Nixon's most loyal fan, and Diane Sawyer, (Kate Jennings Grant), is a consultant and assistant. Nixon tells Frost at the get-go, ""I shall be your fiercest adversary. I shall come at you with everything I've got. Because the limelight can only shine on one of us.""Ultimately, forty-four million viewers turned-out to watch Richard Nixon go head-to-head with David Frost, about a third of the U.S. viewing public at the time. Director Ron Howard brings the tension and drama of this event to the screen...and then some. He focuses more on the psychological aspects of the characters rather than on the politics involved - to great effect. Howard explores each man's insecurities and the enormity of their egos. He really captures the intensity of the interview sessions, including shots of Nixon mopping perspiration from his upper lip with a handkerchief.I was somewhat disturbed by one scene, a contrived midnight telephone call that Nixon, who had been drinking, makes to Frost. As so much of this film is accurate, or mostly accurate, the insert of a purely fictional event, is powerful but misleading. Mr. Howard took dramatic license too far in this instance.Again, Mr. Langella's portrayal of Richard Nixon is stellar. Two monologues, in particular, stand out as exceptional. The final interview scenes, with close-ups of Mr. Nixon's/Langella's face, of his thoughtful, almost poignant expressions are phenomenal as he admits that he, ""let the American people down.""This is a film which brings much depth to the event which it portrays, and to the characters involved. As a baby boomer, who clearly remembers Watergate, and the events surrounding it, I was riveted to the screen. Highly recommended.Jana Perskie",4,"""I shall be your fiercest adversary/I shall come at you with everything I've got....the limelight can only shine on one of us""",1240963200,"04 29,

Taking place just 3 years after Nixon resigned office in the wake of the Watergate scandal, the interview was chance for Nixon to regain public attention and perhaps even burnish his dulled reputation. Frost, at least as depicted in the movie, is on the down side of a career of inconsequential interviews. Both men have everything riding on the outcome.Ron Howard gives us a very interesting and very watchable movie about the two men at the center of this drama. Unfortunately, he seems to do this by simplifying characters and jamming the plot through the Hollywood cliche machine. Frost becomes a womanizing nitwit who eschew research. Nixon is money-hungry, wily and manipulative. As Frost's first interviews go badly, Howard has Frost go through an instant transformation into a night owl boning up on Watergate trivia. This sort of plot is so old what as to have been laughable. I am dying to watch the original interview to see how badly Howerd's adaptation misconstrues the original.Though Frank Langella is too old to be playing Nixon, he captured some of the man's awkward intensity. The prosthetic nose didn't hurt. Michael Sheen basically reprised his role as the affable Tony Blair in ""The Queen, "" playing he affable David Frost. He seemed to have missed Frost's urbane wittiness playing him as wide-eyed and confused. The best role went to Kevin Bacon as a steely-eyed Nixon aide, who with one look could blister the paint off walls. Sam Rockwell, playing anti-Nixon researcher James Reston Jr., decided to channel Rick Moranis of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" fame. This was unfortunate, missed opportunities to a) explain why so many people loathed Nixon, and b) demonstrate why anti-Nixon paranoia might have been ill-founded.Though the film was entertaining enough, the whiff of historical revision make me reluctant to endorse it wholeheartedly.

Danzig,"[19, 23]","I'm afraid I must take exception to director Ron Howard's assertion in his commentary on this DVD that creative license is a good thing when telling a story based on real-life events.In my opinion, he and the playwright/screenwriter have taken too many creative liberties and muddied the waters here in a way that will raise doubts about the truth and consequences of the actual Frost/Nixon interviews as well as the true character of each man.For example, in real life, Nixon did NOT call Frost after-hours in his hotel, rambling on in his cups about the way both men rose from humble origins and fought an uphill battle against their social superiors.This is an important falsehood, because in the movie, Frost attempts to psyche out Nixon before the final Watergate interview by alluding to this phone call.  Well, this phone call NEVER happened!Similarly, as Frost questions Nixon about his illegal incursions into Cambodia during the Vietnam War, the movie shows both men responding to footage of the ensuing carnage.  Apparently, the real F/N interview did NOT resort to this ungainly sort of ""gotcha"" journalism.  Again, this is an unfortunate distortion that actually makes the movie viewer feel more sympathy for Nixon, which in reality is unwarranted.The producers of this DVD could have remedied this confusion by including a second disc containing the entire actual F/N Watergate interview rather than a brief bonus feature with video excerpts from the interview.Otherwise Frank Langella is superb as Nixon, but I felt that Michael Sheen overplayed his role as Frost.  I suspect that Sheen failed to modulate his stage performance for the screen, which could also be Howard's failing, despite his stated ambition to be an ""actor's director"".In the final analysis, the movie may serve a useful purpose if it stirs the American public to demand greater accountability of our leaders and also the media that cover them.But I fear that it does history no favors.",3,Ron Howard's Creative License Should Be Suspended,1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,1970,"[""'m"", 'afraid', 'must', 'take', 'exception', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'assertion', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'creative', 'license', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'telling', 'story', 'based', 'real-life', 'events.In', 'opinion', 'playwright/screenwriter', 'have', 'taken', 'too', 'many', 'creative', 'liberties', 'muddied', 'waters', 'here', 'way', 'will', 'raise', 'doubts', 'truth', 'consequences', 'actual', 'Frost/Nixon', 'interviews', 'as', 'well', 'true', 'character', 'man.For', 'example', 'real', 'life', 'Nixon', 'did', 'NOT', 'call', 'Frost', 'after-hours', 'hotel', 'rambling', 'cups', 'way', 'men', 'rose', 'humble', 'origins', 'fought', 'uphill', 'battle', 'social', 'superiors.This', 'important', 'falsehood', 'movie', 'Frost', 'psyche', 'out', 'Nixon', 'final', 'Watergate', 'interview', 'alluding', 'phone', 'call', 'Well', 'phone', 'call', 'NEVER', 'happened', 'Similarly', 'Frost', 'questions', 'Nixon', 'illegal', 'incursions', 'Cambodia', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'movie', 'men', 'responding', 'footage', 'ensuing', 'carnage', 'Apparently', 'real', 'F/N', 'interview', 'did', 'NOT', 'resort', 'ungainly', 'sort', 'gotcha', 'journalism', 'Again', 'unfortunate', 'distortion', 'actually', 'movie', 'viewer', 'feel', 'more', 'sympathy', 'Nixon', 'reality', 'unwarranted.The', 'producers', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'remedied', 'confusion', 'including', 'second', 'disc', 'containing', 'entire', 'actual', 'F/N', 'Watergate', 'interview', 'rather', 'brief', 'bonus', 'feature', 'video', 'excerpts', 'interview.Otherwise', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'superb', 'Nixon', 'felt', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'overplayed', 'role', 'Frost', 'suspect', 'Sheen', 'failed', 'modulate', 'stage', 'performance', 'screen', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'Howard', 'failing', 'stated', 'ambition', 'be', 'actor', 'director', 'final', 'analysis', 'movie', 'may', 'serve', 'useful', 'purpose', 'American', 'public', 'demand', 'greater', 'accountability', 'leaders', 'also', 'media', 'cover', 'them.But', 'fear', 'history', 'favors']",Frost/Nixon

Nixon is portrayed as someone olny interested in a fat cheque now that his presidency is over and a charming overseas reporter lines up the opportunity of a lifetime out of his own pocketbook. The pacing is interesting since both men are such opposites and Frost quickly realizes he needs to change strategies to come out of this w/ his career intact.

Michael Sheen holds his own as an essentially nice guy who is clearly out of his league, as was intended, but who came out swinging.  The dialogue between Frost and Nixon--particularly in the ghostly, surreal scene in which Nixon calls him from his hotel to let him know that ""only one of us can share the limelight"" while taping the conversation (old habits die hard, I guess) is one of the most intense scenes I've witnessed in contemporary cinema.The first half hour of the movie is an exercise in sheer defeat, with Frost being battered about by Nixon's almost preternatural sense of verbal retaliation and excuse making for Watergate.  As the movie proceeds we see the essentially tragic and bitter nature of the man, as even his loyal aid Jack Brennan (in a good performance by Kevin Bacon) cannot get him to keep his mouth shut.  That famous line: ""If the President does it, it's not illegal!"" booms from his mouth like the crack of doom. Clocking in at an intense 122 minutes, not one moment turns away from the hateful psyche of this man who was so brilliant and could have done so much but instead went the way of Moloch.

The movie starts off with the world's and Frost's fascination with Nixon's resignation and the lengths he went to secure Nixon as an interview subject. Frost bet not only his career on the interviews but his life as well. He put all his assets on the line, and borrowed from all his friends to pay the $600,000 Nixon (and his agents) asked for.Part of Frosts preparation for the interviews was to hire researchers for background on Nixon and to formulate the questions asked during the interviews. The researchers, played by Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell add not only some comic relief, but provide a behind the scenes look at the pressure they were under and exerted on Frost to, not just interview Nixon but to push him and ask the hard questions, to at least try for some accountability from Nixon, which of course resulted in Nixon blurting out that if the President does something it makes it legal.From Nixon's point of view we're shown his isolation, even when he's surrounded by aides, family, friends and supporters. We're also given a window into Nixon's insecurities with a drunken phone call to Frost, and Nixon rails on about the injustices and perceived slights he suffered throughout his life at the hands of others. Nixon also tried to get the psychological edge on Frost by asking off-kilter questions right before taping would begin, such as asking Frost if he had fornicated the night before, which was a famously well known anecdote at the time.When I first saw the previews of Frost/Nixon I cringed when I saw Frank Langella as Nixon because it looked like a caricature. But that was before seeing the movie. Langella merges so successfully with Nixon that you cease to think of him doing a character but of personifying Nixon.Ron Howard isn't a flashy director, he uses special effects only when necessary to the plot, and he isn't given to using the usual directors devices to add false emotion to a scene, instead he trusts the story, he trusts that the drama of the situations to carry the viewer interest, to provide them with an emotionally satisfying experience. Howard is one of the best directors working today, he consistently gets solid performances from his actors. The subject matter he chooses to direct is diverse and compelling. All of which is a far cry from his directorial debut of Eat My Dust.The bonus features include, deleted scenes, a making of featurette, there's a short documentary look at the actual interviews as compared to the dramatized interviews, and there's a featurette that's bit of a propaganda for the Nixon library.

It's talky. But in the talk is all the drama. Secondly, it's an acting tour de force. How did Langella do it?I initially resisted seeing this film. After all, I was one of those 45 million Americans who sat riveted for the original Frost/Nixon interviews. I still remember the quiet, but titanic battle of wits between the TV entertainer and the wily ex-President, ending in the jaw dropping admission and near-apology to the American people. It was the stuff of history, and of legend.Films about real people are always a dice throw, especially famous people you think you know so well. Nixion, in particular, fascinates Hollywood directors. We've already seen Anthony Hopkins take on Tricky Dick. What was Frank Langella going to do with him?What Frank Langella accomplishes in the film is to crawl inside Nixon's skin, into his very core, and manifest the complex emotions with subtle nuances. He captures a range of emotions with the squint of an eye, twitch of the mouth, the iron clad sense of self and power beneath the camera-ready smile. It is virtuosity.Michael Sheen as Frost is good, but he has a bit of room to play. I remember the real David Frost from back in the day. He came to American TV as a whiz kid, quickly fizzled, and around the time of Frost/Nixon was seen as a flash in the pan. Nobody much remembers the 1970's David Frost -not as much as everybody remembers Richard Nixon. Sheen captures the determined careerism, the sort of smarmy charm and playboy rep Frost had back then. His Frost is easy to underestimate. Sheen nails him.As I remember the real Frost/Nixon interview, Frost was never a light weight and Nixon was actually funny and charming.

The movie takes us back to a time when Presidents didn't pop up on every channel everyday as they do now.  Convincing Nixon to be interviewed following the Watergate scandal was quite a coup, even though Frost had a hard time selling it to networks and sponsors.Michael Sheen (The Queen) portrays Frost as a confident, ambitious journalist and playboy.  Frank Langella (Dracula) so completely embraces the essence of Nixon that even though he may not look like the man, he IS the man, with all his flaws and failings and ultimate sadness.  The actual subject matter of the film - the backstage negotiations, the toadies on both sides, the strategies - were of little interest to me, but the two stars are such good actors that I found the movie riveting.  It constantly builds in intensity and suspense and we know that eventually Frost will elicit a monumental admission of guilt from Nixon.  This was huge at the time, although since then, we have seen Presidents concede mistakes almost on a regular basis.

Amidst controversy, and in order to avoid impeachment, Nixon had resigned in 1974, but he never admitted that he knew about the breaking and entering into the Democratic National Headquarters in 1972.  He retired to California and tried to live a quiet life but the scandal always haunted him.  In 1977, David Frost, considered a ""lightweight"" British television personality, paid for the opportunity to interview Richard Nixon is a series of four interviews on national television.  This film is a fictionalized version of events leading up to the interviews and the interviews themselves.Directed by Ron Howard, the film stars Frank Langella as Richard Nixon, whose performance is no less than exceptional. He might not look like the real Nixon, but every gesture seemed extremely authentic and the subtle and conflicting emotions he had to portray seemed very real.  Michael Sheen was cast as David Frost.  He did a wonderful job.  It didn't take long for me to totally accept their screen versions of these two important individuals and I must stay their performances were outstanding.However, there were parts in the film that just dragged.

Peasley,"[0, 0]","If the subject matter interests you, and you aren't bothered by a few deviations from historical accuracy in the interest of dramatic emphasis, then this is a solid recreation of this very interesting series of events. It looks magnificent as well (especially on blu-ray). And, surprisingly for a Hollywood movie, it's politically reasonably fair and balanced - apart from the underlying assumption that Watergate was indisputably a crime of Hitlerian proportions and the depiction of Nixon's acolytes as comical figures (as Republicans are inevitably portrayed in Hollywoodland). By contrast, Frost's left-wing advisers' ignoble obsession with ""getting"" Nixon by humiliating him on TV is portrayed as simply the passionate seeking after truth with rationality and truth-to-power all firmly on their side.Surprisingly, Nixon himself is accorded sympathetic treatment, although admittedly with an air of excuse-making condescension. Well, he did SOME good, we are told, despite the wickednesses of Cambodia and Watergate. Also, he was polite, thoughtful, and courtly (and loved music - even played the piano and wrote his own stuff). AND he had a pretty tough upbringing - so how could he help becoming a bit of a mongrel? Also, it was a long time ago; Watergate just doesn't inflame us with the same indignation these days and we have far weightier and more recent presidential crimes to deal with, according to the Hollywood weltanschauung.But if you're Republican and you don't mind a whiff of patronization you should be able to sit through this with only the odd stirring in your seat. It should maintain your interest; the performances are pretty good although once again dramatic necessity sometimes predominates over historical accuracy. For example,  Michael Sheen and Frank Langella's performances in the leading roles would probably be judged superb if it wasn't for the fact that there is an awful lot of footage of the real people involved doing the very same things they do in the movie. Compared to the real David Frost, for example, Sheen's portrayal comes across as far too lightweight and completely lacking in the sense of authority (however spurious in reality) that the original exuded. Also missing is Frost's characteristic manner: a kind of harried urbanity and loftiness. But if you're after a lightweight David trying to bring down the Nixon Goliath then you should be fine with it.Langella's Nixon is also more Langella than Nixon. He overemphasizes the ponderousness and insularity of the original; at times he appears to on the brink of senility with mind drifting off elsewhere even though the ex-President was only 64 at the time. Nixon's pugnaciousness, energy, and incisiveness are missing as well. When Langella gets aggressive it is with all the desperation of a toothless lion; hey, he's got nothing to hurt you with. It'll be over in a minute. But if you're after a beaten Nixon trying to live in dignified self-denial (despite the overwhelming evidence against him) you should be fine with it.However, methinks I protest too much. If you're after the original then watch the original interviews.

In that small piece of time we are entertained by Frank Langella's interpetation of Nixon.  He captures Nixon's complexities in adroit and deeply personal way.The movie is simple quality and succeeds by not trying to cover everything in Nixon's life, but shows a Nixon, wanting to change perceptions of his Presidency, adapting to retirement as he grieves his loss of powerful and social status.Michael Sheen plays David Frost, a smooth and dapper playboy interviewer who interviews Nixon in 1977.  Frank Langella's Nixon at first does not seem like Nixon, but as the movie goes on, you feel he actually is Nixon.  He catches nuances and delivers on the awkward social presence, the ego and self-centeredness, as well as a his pride and arrogance.  The acting is superb, especially in the last half of the movie when the interview debate is one-on-one between Frost and Nixon.Nixon agreed to have Frost interview him to set the story straight and let the public know all the good he did.  He felt he could easily use Frost, who proposed this idea, as he was just a entertaining talk show host - not a heavy-weight interviewer.  Frost was all this, but he was enchanted and determined to interview Nixon from the moment he resigned office.  He wanted to hear Nixon admit his guilt and he wanted to be the man to do it.  Frost was not doing well in the 1970's - his career was at a low-point, doing a talk show in Australia, showing magicians escaping from different types of traps.  No network or large company wanted to back him on this project, so Frost ended up paying a good part of Nixon's $600,0000 fee.  Nixon kept tabs on how desperate Frost was, where he was getting his money and constantly sizing up the situation.Frost's advisers (Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell), are upset when Frost cannot control the first interviews  (there are 4 in all - taped over a period of days - each interview on one subject).  Nixon takes a topic and runs away with his spin on the issues, knowing full well he is an expert on evading questions.  He plays mind games with Frost before the interviews and is cunning on how he handles the beginning interviews.  Frost is helpless as Nixon dominates the conversation.Ron Howard directed this movie and with this excellent group of actors developed a Shakespearean masterpiece.

Playing the late great Interviewer and Talk Show Host Sir David Frost - he was quite simply magnificent in the part - catching every nuance of the man's mannerisms and speech (the 68-year old Frost was actually on set during the making of the film). And Frank Langella as the wily disgraced ex American President Richard Milhous Nixon blew me away as well - reputedly immersing himself in the role for two years (even being referred to as ""Mr. President"" on set to keep in character and maintain the isolation of the most powerful man in the world).And as if these two top leads weren't good enough - you also get Sam Rockwell as James Reston, Jr. (author and the conscience of the people), Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan (Nixon's Chief Of Staff and right-hand man), Matthew MacFadyen as the London Weekend Television Director of Programs John Birt, Oliver Platt as ABC-News Producer Bob Zelnick and Rebecca Hall (of ""Parade's End"" fame) as Caroline Cushing - Frost's recently acquired sexy and stylish girlfriend. Other heavyweights include a brilliant Toby Jones as the hygiene-obsessed Irving ""Swifty"" Lazar (an agent who secured 2.3 million dollars for Nixon's Memoirs) and Andy Milder (of ""Weeds"") as Frank Gannon - a friend of chat-show queen Diane Sawyer.This is a film about politics that needs a script smart enough to decipher its deceptive warrens for an audience - and screenplay writer Peter Morgan delivers again and again in powerhouse dialogues that both entertain and inform (adapted for screen from his own stage play). This is one of those rare films that has a moral centre and takes sides. Yet it also allows the thing to breath - for Nixon the human being to emerge - and gives you enough room to make up your own mind - hero or villain - or both.I was 19 when these staggeringly intimate and loaded interviews happened in 1977 - and still remember their impact as they were broadcast around the world. Tricky Dicky had clearly thought that chat-show lightweight David Frost was simply going to be just anther easy manipulation. The 37th Commander In Chief also figured that he'd grab his $600,000 fee whilst simultaneously talking himself back into the nation's heart (as he'd done before the shame and blame of the Watergate break-ins and his resignation ahead of almost certain Presidential impeachment).The attention to Seventies detail is truly fantastic - the archive footage of the Watergate Scandal, the Senate hearings that followed, the resignation of a sitting American President for the first time in 200 years on August 7th 1974, the garish clothes considered the height of style at the time, the reproduction of the Departure Area at Heathrow in 1977, the Beverley Hilton Hotel room where Frost and his people were encamped. Ron Howard even got two actual locations - 'La Casa Pacifica' - Nixon's mini White House home on the beaches of San Clemente and The Smith's home in Monarch Bay (also in California) where the 4 days and 28 hours of one-on-one no holes barred interviews were conducted.Because Frost was a star at the time in both Australia and Britain and under pressure to deliver - the film smartly shows us that he had on occasion to be reminded by his aides of the worst crime of all - Nixon using the interviews as a way to exonerate himself with the electorate (and on his terms). But credit must go to the canny Frost who had other ideas - finally pushing the old Republican dog into admissions during their Titanic word spars. And of course that famous breakthrough television moment when Nixon finally offered up something of an 'apology' to the hurting American people - combined with what appeared to be a genuine tear of regret in his defensive bloodshot eyes. But even after it was all over and he was leaving The Smiths home like a beaten Gladiator - Nixon's media instinct kicked in. He walked over to a bystander to pet a Dachshund dog in her arms for all the cameras to see (some even saying that if there had been a mother and baby nearby - he'd have used them too). It spoke volumes of the man.In the end was it all a way back in - a ploy - setting the ground for his next few decades of public works? Could you actually believe anything this consummate evader said? The relevancy of the film to today's political landscape couldn't be more apt - and acts as a warning - that we are governed by the 'truth tailored to suit' rather that just the 'truth'. To this day - the general consensus is that Richard Nixon did huge damage to American Politics while presiding over their most pointless and destructive war - Vietnam. And Gerald Ford's all-is-forgiven pardon in the next Presidency felt like a move and not a genuine exoneration.The 2009 BLU RAY picture is properly gorgeous and the colours of the time beautifully rendered. You see so much detail - the flared trousers and plunging halter backs, afghan coats and velvet furnishings, bottle green chandeliers and orange Perspex signs. The EXTRAS are pleasingly long and informative too - over one hour of them including the Real Interviews (you really see how they captured the taste and feel of the room).

The surprise this strikes me with, thinking about the director of such pap as ""Da Vinci Code"" and swill like ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is palpable.""Frost/Nixon"" works on several levels. Acting: Michael Sheen is very good as the unctuous David Frost, at first out of his depth but then finding his footing. Frank Langella is very good as Nixon. His portrayal, compared to Anthony Hopkins', is a bit more of an imitation, but still captures internal feelings and nuances in an affecting way. The period feeling is tremendous. The mid 1970's aesthetic pervades the film, and the lighting and quality of the HD presentation shows us every gold and avocado highlight. The pacing of the script is very crisp and never dull. So, all told, it is a very well done film. It may not deliver the sort of zeitgeist-defining aura of Oliver Stone's film, but is more focused on the personal elements than the over-arching ones.The Blu-Ray:WOW. Now THIS is a High Definition presentation of a movie. Detail is astonishing. Facial pores, dust motes, cloth textures, general color saturation, and black levels are all astonishingly good. When TV shots are used or simulated, individual pixels can be made out. Film grain is present and beautiful, not having been scrubbed away by any DNR. No edge enhancement or jagged edges are visible.It is, frankly, as perfect-looking a presentation as I can imagine. It might be the single best Blu-Ray I have personally seen. Now, this won't be a film that some will want to demo a Blu-Ray player, containing no explosions, spaceships or car chases. But have no doubts. This is utterly spectacular material.The audio is a DTS mix that does a good job mixing dialogue, music, and sound effects. I never had a problem with the mix and did not have to adjust the volume once for clarity.In terms of extras, there about 48 minutes of documentary material, split into 4 programs, that could have been combined into one master program. Two programs are making of material, 6 minutes talk about Nixon's library and and 7.5 minutes tackle the actual interviews. All of this material is in 1080i. 30 minutes of deleted and extended scenes are presented in 480p - most are superfluous and it's good that they were cut. Ron Howard supplies a commentary to the film. It's a decent but not overwhelming slate of extras.*********If you're a fan of political drama, this is a no-brainer.

1236352,A1II8I66S9E84Y,B001TH92N4,Maureen R. Tagliaferro,"[0, 1]","I best remember David Frost for his celebrity interviews and connections to the world of entertainment.  Needless to say, like most from my generation, I best remember Richard Nixon for the infamous Watergate scandal that forced his resignation.  But for one brief period of four well-publicized interviews during the late 1970's, their lives blended.  This I did not remember, but the movie brought out sides of each personality that even my generation could appreciate.It's hard to believe there was a time when producers wouldn't jump at the chance to sponsor an interview of a fallen hero, especially an ex-President.  Could it be that we weren't always a scandal-seeking public?  Or could it be, we were less forgiving thirty years ago than we are as a nation today?  In either case, David Frost had a vision that more accredited political journalists did not.  He wanted to interview Nixon, syndicate the interviews, and get him to admit wrong doing.In stubbornly pursuing what he set out to do, he not only reestablished himself in the celebrity world, he brought out the more human characteristics of Nixon.  That's not to say that Nixon didn't display likable qualities on his own; in fact he was quite humorous.  He was manipulative, sharp, and sarcastic - but he was funny to the point that regardless of what he said - well, he was rather likeable - in an un-Watergate-like way.From the coming attractions, I at first I thought actor Frank Langella might have over-acted in his portrayal of Nixon, but all during my watching of the full-length film, his character came across as genuine.  Michael Sheen was also good in the role of Frost, as I always remembered Frost with a silly smile on his face, which, if not portrayed as a ladies' man, might have made him appear as gay.Whether Frost was really an innovative genius or whether he just lucked out in this case, I could not say.  Nor do I know if Nixon had planned to come clean at the interview's end.  What I do know is that the movie pleasantly focused on the more compelling sides of both questionable personalities without dredging into the more complex details of Watergate.",4,Interesting Piece of History,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,2146,"['best', 'remember', 'David', 'Frost', 'celebrity', 'interviews', 'connections', 'world', 'entertainment', 'Needless', 'say', 'most', 'generation', 'best', 'remember', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'infamous', 'Watergate', 'scandal', 'forced', 'resignation', 'one', 'brief', 'period', 'four', 'well-publicized', 'interviews', 'late', '1970', 'lives', 'blended', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'movie', 'brought', 'out', 'sides', 'personality', 'even', 'generation', 'could', 'appreciate.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'producers', 'would', ""n't"", 'jump', 'chance', 'sponsor', 'interview', 'fallen', 'hero', 'especially', 'ex-President', 'Could', 'be', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'scandal-seeking', 'public', 'could', 'be', 'were', 'less', 'forgiving', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'nation', 'today', 'case', 'David', 'Frost', 'had', 'vision', 'more', 'accredited', 'political', 'journalists', 'did', 'not', 'wanted', 'interview', 'Nixon', 'syndicate', 'interviews', 'get', 'admit', 'wrong', 'doing.In', 'stubbornly', 'pursuing', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'reestablished', 'celebrity', 'world', 'brought', 'out', 'more', 'human', 'characteristics', 'Nixon', 'not', 'say', 'Nixon', 'did', ""n't"", 'display', 'likable', 'qualities', 'own', 'fact', 'was', 'quite', 'humorous', 'was', 'manipulative', 'sharp', 'sarcastic', 'was', 'funny', 'point', 'regardless', 'what', 'said', 'well', 'was', 'rather', 'likeable', 'un-Watergate-like', 'way.From', 'coming', 'attractions', 'first', 'thought', 'actor', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'might', 'have', 'over-acted', 'portrayal', 'Nixon', 'watching', 'full-length', 'film', 'character', 'came', 'genuine', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'role', 'Frost', 'always', 'remembered', 'Frost', 'silly', 'smile', 'face', 'not', 'portrayed', 'ladies', 'man', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'appear', 'gay.Whether', 'Frost', 'was', 'really', 'innovative', 'genius', 'just', 'lucked', 'out', 'case', 'could', 'not', 'say', 'do', 'know', 'Nixon', 'had', 'planned', 'come', 'clean', 'interview', 'end', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'movie', 'pleasantly', 'focused', 'more', 'compelling', 'sides', 'questionable', 'personalities', 'dredging', 'more', 'complex', 'details', 'Watergate']",Frost/Nixon

1236355,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001TH92N4,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","Ron Howard brings the stage play ""Frost/Nixon"" by Peter Morgan to the screen, retaining the two lead actors in their roles as British talk show host David Frost and former American President Richard Nixon, whom Frost interviewed  for 6 hours of television in 1977. When the President resigned on the heels of the Watergate scandal in 1974, David Frost (Michael Sheen) thought an interview with Nixon would make great television. President Nixon (Frank Langella) thought it would give him an opportunity to say his piece without having to answer tough questions. But the television networks weren't interested, because Nixon was being paid. It took years for Frost to pull together enough money to syndicate the show himself. The famous interviews aired in May 1977 to great success.""Frost/Nixon"" is about why the people involved were so committed to the project as much as it is about the interviews. The screenplay fleshes out the supporting cast, the research teams of both Frost and Nixon, more than the play. It replaces the play's narration with interview-style footage of the personnel that gives the impression of being made for a documentary years after the action took place. So the narrative thread and a pseudo-documentary combine to tell the story. Frost and Nixon are both ambitious men from modest backgrounds. Frost is a showman by trade, not viewed as weighty enough to interview the disgraced former President. Even his researchers Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and Jim  Reston (Sam Rockwell) have doubts. And Frost can't raise the money.Nixon's self-righteous and intensely loyal Chief of Staff Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) is confident that Frost is no match for Nixon's experience and intellect, and this will be a chance for the former President to rehabilitate his image. Kevin Bacon is fantastic, as he makes the audience empathize with a man whom we probably don't like very much. For better or worse, Richard Nixon is posthumously being defined by movies and television, and I'm sure that Frank Langella's revelatory performance in ""Frost/Nixon"" will be one of the defining images, along with Anthony Hopkins' in Oliver Stone'sNixon.The real Frost/Nixon interviews took place in 12 sessions, not the 4 we see in the film. The content of the interviews in the film are nearly the real thing, but I'm not sure how much the rest of the story has been embellished. Frost's struggles in the early interviews seem to have been exaggerated, though I gather that his financial difficulties were not. Nevertheless, ""Frost/Nixon"" is a thoughtful exploration, not only of the character of Richard Nixon, but the reductive power of television, the motives of its participants, and a timely commentary on the abuse of power by public officials. I'm impressed with Ron Howard's ability to adapt the play so effectively to the screen. He is often criticized for avoiding edgy material or simply not being good at it, but ""Frost/Nixon"" defies that perception.The DVD (Universal 2009): There are 3 featurettes, 7 deleted scenes (22 min), and a feature commentary with director Ron Howard. ""The Making of Frost/Nixon"" (22 min) is presented in 4 parts: The Cast, in which the cast talk about the real people they play, and Ron Howard talks about creating an ensemble cast, The Costumes, discussed by designer Daniel Orlando, The Production Design, with Michael Corenblith, The Shooting Style, with cinematographer Salvatore Totino. ""The Nixon Library"" (6 min) interviews John H. Taylor, the Executive Director of the Library. In ""The Real Interview"" (7 1/2 min), cast and crew recall their experiences watching the interview on TV in 1977.  The audio commentary by Ron Howard is fairly constant.

Da Vinci Code, which let's face it, just about everyone had read or at least heard the ending, Apollo 13, or even arguably A Beautiful Mind... and now we have Frost / Nixon, a reconstruction of the interviews, and story behind the interviews, of which the main result is already well known.It's 1977, and Nixon has been out of the public eye since his resignation in 1974.  A young TV presenter, David Frost, in need of a hit to bolster his career, puts everything he has into a series of 4 interviews with Nixon.  The result - well, far be it from me to spoil the ending, just in case you don't know - but even if you do, just like the director's previous outings it ends up being surprisingly watchable and even tense.  Howard succeeds by making this less about the details of Nixon or Watergate, and instead focuses on Frost.  What made him tick, and how did he turn things around against the odds.  That, and the fascinating idea of the interview as a duel between the two men.  That mixture is then admirably steered to success by two terrific performances from the leads... If you are familiar with Frost, when you first see Sheen as Frost your jaw will drop, but beyond the astonishing mimicry, Sheen gets under the skin of the character Frost is portrayed as.. ambitious, performer, party animal, but underneath the surface, a latent ability to grab on like a terrier and not let go.  For Frank Langella's part, he certainly captures the haunted frustration and loneliness, combined with fierce intellect, of Nixon.  The main two are ably supported by a terrific supporting cast - Kevin Bacon, Toby Jones, Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell all have moments to shine, though the token female role played by Rebecca Hall seems redundant in the context of the movie.Whether this is really how it went down has been much discussed, the phone call that is key to the events in the movie, never happened in reality we are told.  But these tweaks from history notwithstanding, this is great drama, presented with Howard's trademark slick efficiency.  There may be no guns, no car chases and a lot of talking - but it's no less a thriller for all that.  What's more, the bluray has excerpts of the original interviews, which make fascinating viewing, particularly in the side by side mode with the movie.Recommended.",4,Efficient and compelling account of the Nixon interviews,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,2391,"['Ron', 'Howard', 'be', 'becoming', 'king', 'movies', 'where', 'know', 'ending..', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'let', 'face', 'just', 'everyone', 'had', 'read', 'least', 'ending', 'Apollo', '13', 'even', 'arguably', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'now', 'have', 'Frost', '/', 'Nixon', 'reconstruction', 'interviews', 'story', 'interviews', 'main', 'result', 'already', 'well', 'known.It', '1977', 'Nixon', 'been', 'public', 'eye', 'resignation', '1974', 'young', 'TV', 'presenter', 'David', 'Frost', 'need', 'hit', 'bolster', 'career', 'everything', 'series', '4', 'interviews', 'Nixon', 'result', 'well', 'far', 'be', 'spoil', 'ending', 'just', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'even', 'do', 'just', 'director', 'previous', 'outings', 'up', 'being', 'surprisingly', 'watchable', 'even', 'tense', 'Howard', 'making', 'less', 'details', 'Nixon', 'Watergate', 'instead', 'focuses', 'Frost', 'What', 'made', 'tick', 'how', 'did', 'turn', 'things', 'odds', 'fascinating', 'idea', 'interview', 'duel', 'two', 'men', 'mixture', 'then', 'admirably', 'steered', 'success', 'two', 'terrific', 'performances', 'leads', 'are', 'familiar', 'Frost', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'Sheen', 'Frost', 'jaw', 'will', 'drop', 'astonishing', 'mimicry', 'Sheen', 'skin', 'character', 'Frost', 'portrayed', 'as..', 'ambitious', 'performer', 'party', 'animal', 'surface', 'latent', 'ability', 'grab', 'terrier', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'part', 'certainly', 'haunted', 'frustration', 'loneliness', 'combined', 'fierce', 'intellect', 'Nixon', 'main', 'two', 'are', 'ably', 'supported', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'have', 'moments', 'shine', 'token', 'female', 'role', 'played', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'redundant', 'context', 'movie.Whether', 'really', 'how', 'went', 'down', 'been', 'much', 'discussed', 'phone', 'call', 'key', 'events', 'movie', 'never', 'happened', 'reality', 'are', 'told', 'tweaks', 'history', 'notwithstanding', 'great', 'drama', 'presented', 'Howard', 'trademark', 'slick', 'efficiency', 'may', 'be', 'guns', 'car', 'chases', 'lot', 'talking', 'less', 'thriller', 'What', 'more', 'bluray', 'excerpts', 'original', 'interviews', 'make', 'fascinating', 'viewing', 'particularly', 'side', 'side', 'mode', 'movie.Recommended']",Frost/Nixon

Michael Sheen plays that glad-handing dilettante, British talk show host David Frost in truth a little unevenly: at times caricaturing his bouffant mincing drawl like an effete Austin Powers, at times a spookily accurate rendition, at times a diluted one not a million miles away from the same actor's celebrated portrayal of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.But this unevenness is I think demanded by the script which asks us to believe the same man was by turns the sort of international playboy shagadelically chatting up first class posh girls over the mid Atlantic, a superficial chancer prepared to take on any assignment including (quel horreur!) hosting an Australian chat show, an impulsive bluffer forced into a desperate fundraising measures by a rash commitment which he couldn't back up and an incisive political analyst, able finally to pull Richard Nixon limb from limb when it seemed all was intractably lost.  I have a suspicion Frost wasn't really any of things, at least not to anything like the degree suggested here.But that is what good drama requires, and in this way and in others the dramatic archetypes on which the screenplay was surely based occasionally show through. In a historical drama the screenplay writer's job is to extrude from the intractably interwoven fabric of fact a recognisable narrative when in reality one never existed. Ron Howard does this artfully but is almost too successful for his own good. The narrative prescribes a perfect ""confronting the monster"" trajectory, with all the phases and characters clearly articulated: henchmen, damsels, wise counsel, facilitating assistants, a call to challenge, early success, dramatic reversal and then triumph out of certain defeat.But real life, as they say, doesn't follow the script. Now it might just be that the Nixon interviews really did play out in so dramatically perfect a fashion, but you do have to wonder how much additional fictionalising the screenplay involves. A thoroughly implausible drunken midnight conversation, in particular, had the ring of a dramatic as opposed to historical device.That said, for the very same reason, the Frost/Nixon is extremely entertaining and has piqued my interest enough to find out some more. Special mention should go to the extremely effective secondary cast: Sam Rockwell - not that long ago Zaphod Beeblebrox - all but unrecognisable as Frost's excitable and overly-principled anti-Nixon researcher, Kevin Bacon's typically assured and unflashy portrayal of Nixon's chief of staff Jack Brennan and Toby Jones' creepy portrayal of Nixon's weirdo PR Guy, Swifty Lazar.Well recommended.Olly Buxton",4,Beauty and the Beast,1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,2916,"['What', 'mightily', 'enjoyable', 'film.Frank', 'Langella', 'renders', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'slower', 'older', 'heftier', 'really', 'was', 'somewhere', 'punch', 'drunk', 'prize', 'fighter', 'waning', 'silverbacked', 'gorilla', 'snorting', 'puffing', 'attentions', 'glad-handing', 'young', 'dilettante', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'glad-handing', 'dilettante', 'British', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'David', 'Frost', 'truth', 'little', 'unevenly', 'times', 'caricaturing', 'bouffant', 'mincing', 'drawl', 'effete', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'times', 'spookily', 'accurate', 'rendition', 'times', 'diluted', 'one', 'not', 'million', 'miles', 'away', 'same', 'actor', 'celebrated', 'portrayal', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair.But', 'unevenness', 'think', 'demanded', 'script', 'believe', 'same', 'man', 'was', 'sort', 'international', 'playboy', 'shagadelically', 'chatting', 'up', 'first', 'class', 'posh', 'girls', 'mid', 'Atlantic', 'superficial', 'chancer', 'prepared', 'take', 'assignment', 'including', 'quel', 'horreur', 'hosting', 'Australian', 'chat', 'show', 'impulsive', 'bluffer', 'forced', 'desperate', 'fundraising', 'measures', 'rash', 'commitment', 'could', ""n't"", 'back', 'up', 'incisive', 'political', 'analyst', 'able', 'finally', 'pull', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'limb', 'limb', 'when', 'seemed', 'was', 'intractably', 'lost', 'have', 'suspicion', 'Frost', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'things', 'least', 'not', 'anything', 'degree', 'suggested', 'here.But', 'what', 'good', 'drama', 'way', 'others', 'dramatic', 'archetypes', 'screenplay', 'was', 'surely', 'based', 'occasionally', 'show', 'historical', 'drama', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'job', 'extrude', 'intractably', 'interwoven', 'fabric', 'fact', 'recognisable', 'narrative', 'when', 'reality', 'one', 'never', 'existed', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'artfully', 'almost', 'too', 'successful', 'own', 'good', 'narrative', 'prescribes', 'perfect', 'confronting', 'monster', 'trajectory', 'phases', 'characters', 'clearly', 'articulated', 'henchmen', 'damsels', 'wise', 'counsel', 'facilitating', 'assistants', 'call', 'challenge', 'early', 'success', 'dramatic', 'reversal', 'then', 'triumph', 'certain', 'defeat.But', 'real', 'life', 'say', ""n't"", 'follow', 'script', 'Now', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'Nixon', 'interviews', 'really', 'did', 'play', 'out', 'so', 'dramatically', 'perfect', 'fashion', 'do', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'additional', 'fictionalising', 'screenplay', 'thoroughly', 'implausible', 'drunken', 'midnight', 'conversation', 'particular', 'had', 'ring', 'dramatic', 'opposed', 'historical', 'device.That', 'said', 'very', 'same', 'reason', 'Frost/Nixon', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'piqued', 'interest', 'enough', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Special', 'mention', 'should', 'go', 'extremely', 'effective', 'secondary', 'cast', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'Zaphod', 'Beeblebrox', 'unrecognisable', 'Frost', 'excitable', 'overly-principled', 'anti-Nixon', 'researcher', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'typically', 'assured', 'unflashy', 'portrayal', 'Nixon', 'chief', 'staff', 'Jack', 'Brennan', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'creepy', 'portrayal', 'Nixon', 'weirdo', 'PR', 'Guy', 'Swifty', 'Lazar.Well', 'recommended.Olly', 'Buxton']",Frost/Nixon

The film is quite compelling with a taste of nostalgia, and of course historic. But the performance by Michael Sheen of David Frost struck me as rather weak. I kept saying to myself; I know my memory of Frost is from many years past, but I don't remember him like this. The portrayal of Frost in this film makes him seem like an empty suite almost, lacking depth of personality, intelligence and character. Although he does seem to find that depth at a critical point in the film, the last interview. As much as I enjoyed Langella's performance, I wouldn't call it altogether accurate. I remember very well that Nixon would always smile whenever his words expressed sorrow or regret, which he did continually in the real interviews. That notable aspect of Nixon's personality was absent in this film, as well as less definable aspects. But I can't say I actually missed it. This Nixon comes across as more human and vulnerable than the genuine article.

Then the objective viewer can see the extent to which the filmmakers exaggerated tye performance of the ""real"" David Frost back in 1977.Noticeable differences are that Sheen looks about 26 years and Frost was over 40 at the time - not a big point but his youthfulness and ""dandy"" personality do not come through the real deal. This movie strives to suggestr that the sexually ambiguous man can beat out the assertive, dominant male. ""Nixon"" asks ""Frost"" if he ""fornicated"" the night before a taping, with a hint of sarcasm - earlier, an assistant - Bacon - points out that Frost's shoes are imported and not exactly masculine. At the end of this film, Nixon defeated again, this time not by himself but by the bisexual (?) with the fancy attire and disco social life, looks pensively at an unopened box of shoes - a gift from the triumphant Frost - a pair of the same shoes which provoked sarcasm.Actress Hall has many scenes - first one, on a plane, where she meets Frost and instantaneously becomes his...what? Girfriend? More ambiguity. The worst part is that we have no idea why she was on the plane, where she comes from, and why such a sophisticate falls so fast for ""Frost""s ""pick-up"" lines. She gets many close-ups, no chance for us to assimilate her presence.Sheen's acting is top-notch, Langella is convincing as the dour, cerebral world figure, though the mumbling gets annoying. Period detail very compelling. ""Back-story"" very interesting but it's still hard to swallow that David Frost ever had any real career low. It's possible that the match-up, of sorts, worked better if both men had an underlying desire to resuurect themselves in their professions.Point of view of the movie makers seems to be Richard Milhaus Nixon could have made a mediocre President but his hangups made him one of the worst. Some poorly drawn, out of context ""facts"", are used to overshadow major accomplishments: the ""Vietnamization"" of the War, which succeeded; the ending of the Draft; fruitful visits to China and Russia; a strong belief in Affirmative Action; a strong economy.",2,Flawed but worth watching,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,2182,"['saying', 'move', 'should', 'be', 'seen', '*or*', 'Frost-Nixon', 'Complete', 'Interviews', 'Then', 'objective', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'extent', 'filmmakers', 'exaggerated', 'tye', 'performance', 'real', 'David', 'Frost', 'back', '1977.Noticeable', 'differences', 'are', 'Sheen', '26', 'years', 'Frost', 'was', '40', 'time', 'not', 'big', 'point', 'youthfulness', 'dandy', 'personality', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'real', 'deal', 'movie', 'suggestr', 'sexually', 'ambiguous', 'man', 'can', 'beat', 'out', 'assertive', 'dominant', 'male', 'Nixon', 'Frost', 'fornicated', 'night', 'taping', 'hint', 'sarcasm', 'earlier', 'assistant', 'Bacon', 'points', 'out', 'Frost', 'shoes', 'are', 'imported', 'not', 'exactly', 'masculine', 'end', 'film', 'Nixon', 'defeated', 'again', 'time', 'not', 'bisexual', 'fancy', 'attire', 'disco', 'social', 'life', 'pensively', 'unopened', 'box', 'shoes', 'gift', 'triumphant', 'Frost', 'pair', 'same', 'shoes', 'provoked', 'sarcasm.Actress', 'Hall', 'many', 'scenes', 'first', 'one', 'plane', 'where', 'Frost', 'instantaneously', 'what', 'Girfriend', 'More', 'ambiguity', 'worst', 'part', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'was', 'plane', 'where', 'why', 'such', 'sophisticate', 'so', 'fast', 'Frost', 's', 'pick-up', 'lines', 'many', 'close-ups', 'chance', 'assimilate', 'presence.Sheen', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'Langella', 'convincing', 'dour', 'cerebral', 'world', 'figure', 'mumbling', 'annoying', 'Period', 'detail', 'very', 'compelling', 'Back-story', 'very', 'interesting', 'still', 'hard', 'swallow', 'David', 'Frost', 'ever', 'had', 'real', 'career', 'low', 'possible', 'match-up', 'sorts', 'worked', 'better', 'men', 'had', 'underlying', 'desire', 'resuurect', 'professions.Point', 'view', 'movie', 'makers', 'be', 'Richard', 'Milhaus', 'Nixon', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'mediocre', 'President', 'hangups', 'made', 'one', 'worst', 'poorly', 'drawn', 'context', 'facts', 'are', 'used', 'overshadow', 'major', 'accomplishments', 'Vietnamization', 'War', 'succeeded', 'ending', 'Draft', 'fruitful', 'visits', 'China', 'Russia', 'strong', 'belief', 'Affirmative', 'Action', 'strong', 'economy']",Frost/Nixon

I remember watching some of them, at least but they were not revelatory in any way.  So....again, why bother to make a film about this, I wondered?

President Nixon on the other hand, loves his life of seclusion and wants to make enough money so that he is not forced to give speaches in small venues.  Both men come from modest means and both have managed to build their careers without any help of connections and ""old"" money.  However their participation in society and the final outcome is as different as it can be.The entire film feels very claustrophobic since both characters meet in controlled, overly protective and guarded venues.  Both of them see the interview as a ticket to break away from their current life patterns and turn the new leaf.  Their meetings and interviews no matter how seemingly cordial and civilized on the outside are as savage as they can be.  It is amazing to see Nixon making sneering comments about most personal matters in his effort to provoke his oponent and throw him off balance.In the end the interview is not about what each one of the men said, but rather what was not said.

1236373,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001TH92N4,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","Never having seen Peter Morgan's ""Frost/Nixon"" on stage, I can't speak to how much it may have gained or lost on its way to the big screen.  I can, however, state that, in its latest incarnation, this is one humdinger of a political drama, as poignant as it is suspenseful, as intimate as it is wide-ranging.The story centers around the famous series of interviews that David Frost conducted with Richard Nixon in the spring of 1977, nearly three years after Nixon had been forced to resign in disgrace from the office of President of the United States.  This is the encounter in which Nixon famously declared, ""When the president does it, that means it is not illegal"" - as clear-cut and definitive an acknowlegement of the corrupting infuence of power as one could ever possibly expect from a politician.Morgan and director Ron Howard have taken full advantage of the new medium, giving the material room to breathe by opening it out beyond the restricted confines of the interview setting to the world at large.  We go back and forth between London and Los Angeles, visiting key points of interest - The Beverly Hills Hotel, Nixon's home in California, etc. - along the way.  This also means that more time can be devoted to the earlier stages of the story, including Frost's often desperate attempts to secure financing for the project, and the efforts both sides expend on brainstorming and strategizing for the final showdown.And quite a showdown it turns out to be, for at its heart ""Frost/Nixon"" is really an account of a fascinating, take-no-prisoners duel between two evenly matched opponents with diametrically contradictory goals.  For Frost - a British entertainer who had, up to that point, made his name as a variety/talk show host in England and Australia and who was known primarily for his international-playboy antics off the set - these interviews would be his big chance to definitively establish, before a worldwide audience, his bona fides as a serious journalist, hopefully by making a disgraced ex-President wither under the glare of hardball questioning.  For Richard Nixon, this seemed the golden opportunity to finally begin what would be a long and grueling process of rehabilitating his reputation and his legacy in the eyes of the public and of burnishing his place in history.Thus, with so much at stake, both men are seen throughout the movie trying their best to manipulate the interviews and indeed each other to their own advantage.  Keenly aware that only one of them can ultimately emerge victorious from the encounter, these two intellectual prizefighters jockey for position and power, sniffing out their opponent's weaknesses and vulnerabilities while playing intricately developed mind games on one another in the hopes of gaining the upper hand.  Yet, oddly, as is usually the case in such situations, these two opponents actually discover that they have more in common with one another than they have differences that separate them.For all its excellences of cinematography, editing and direction, ""Frost/Nixon"" is still, at its core and in deference to its theatrical roots, an ""actors' picture,"" with Michael Sheen and Frank Langella brilliantly reprising the roles they created on stage.  Langella never falls into the trap of relying solely on mimicry to capture the essence of a well-known and easily caricatured public figure.  Instead, he allows us to see the subtle machinations of a man long adept at pulling the levers of power by manipulating events and other individuals to his own advantage.  Yet, at the same time, he shows us the gentler, more human side of a man wracked by loneliness and his innate lack of likeability, who certainly didn't set out in life to become a tragic figure but who, through a lack of a clear moral compass, ended up that way anyway.  Sheen more than fulfills the promise he demonstrated playing Tony Blair in ""The Queen,"" making of Frost a good-natured but shrewd creature of the limelight who learns right quick that he needs to be wary of how a trapped beast will react when he's pushed into a corner with no way out.  The beauty of the film is that, for all its emphasis on competitiveness and antagonism, it still manages to convey the mutual respect and even camaraderie that eventually came to define the relationship between the two men.These two towering performers are nicely complemented by similarly impressive work by Kevin Bacon as Nixon's loyal aide, Rebecca Hall as Frost's latest girlfriend, and Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt as anti-Nixon zealots brought in to help Frost craft the questions he's going to ask.Of course, as with most docudramas, it's often hard to tell which events are strictly factual (i.e. docu) and which have been made up or distorted for the sake of the drama.  There is one glaring anachronism, for instance, when the filmmakers show Frost heading off to the premiere of ""The Slipper and the Rose"" - a movie he helped finance - on the eve of the first interview in March 1977 when the movie was actually released in late 1976.  And I`m sure there are plenty more, much less innocuous fabrications that those closer to the subject could easily point out.  Yet, no matter how much liberty it may take with the facts, ""Frost/Nixon"" turns relatively recent history into a riveting drama that has many pertinent things to say to the world today.",5,an epic

But that wouldn't be as interesting you say, eh? The age of the adaptation has convinced many of that.  I have yet to meet anyone who liked this movie for authentic reasons, for its own merit. Instead, everyone's opinion about the film is clich&eacute;d from the back of the box (i.e. Frank Langella played Nixon well, etc). I personally think that the Frost character was the highlight of the film.But the thing that sticks out above all else about the adaptation is the fact they exaggerated the 2 men's exchanges and showed Nixon's internal feelings (assuming he felt that way) on screen. In the original interview, Nixon's soul is not on display like in the movie. But they knew that to make this movie stand out it would be necessary to show us Nixon's internal doubt and misery. Everyone loves to see the powerful fall from grace and thats why people really liked this movie, but it will be forgotten.

1236375,A387BD735MI50R,B001TH92N4,R. Schultz,"[3, 3]","This movie paints David Frost's interview of Richard Nixon as a verbal boxing match. In part, the interview no doubt did get framed that way - as a result of Nixon's own adversarial spirit, and as a result of the hopes many members of Frost's staff entertained of getting a breakthrough admission of guilt from Nixon in regard to Watergate. However Ron Howard, the Director of this film, said this combative aspect of the interview was enhanced in order to make the film more visually dynamic.Some further poetic license is taken with Frost's reputation. The people ringing this debate are shown repeatedly dismissing Frost as a playboy Hollywood interviewer, as a lightweight unequal to the task of asking any hard-edged political questions, and particularly unequal to the task of getting Nixon to confess to wrong-doing. Again, Ron Howard says that Frost's reputation was skewed this way for the purposes of projecting his encounter with Nixon as a more arresting, more suspenseful ""David"" and Goliath contest.In actuality, Frost has always had the reputation of being much more of an insightful interviewer. When he had his American interview show, people would chuckle a bit at his trademark question, ""How would you define love?"" However overall, it was usually recognized that his offbeat personal questions did end by producing a remarkably intimate, revealing portrait of his subjects. He has always been known as a good listener, as someone able to catch at any loose thread that a person might present. He would then put himself in a position to gently, sympathetically pull on that thread until he unraveled many of the mysteries of his subject's personality.So in watching this movie, I found myself wishing that the interview had, both in reality and for the purposes of this dramatization, gotten framed less as war and more as exploration. I wondered what might have been elicited if Frost had not been pressured to abandon his usual avuncular style in favor of a hard-hitting, ""nail him"" approach. I would at some level have preferred that the movie could have been entitled - not Frost-slash-Nixon (Frost/Nixon) - but in a greater spirit of cooperation, Frost-hyphen-Nixon (Frost-Nixon).For a moment, I thought perhaps such a wish was wrong-headed when I saw Frost elicit what became the advertising trailer for the film - Nixon declaring that when a President decrees something - ""then it's NOT illegal."" However in his commentary, Ron Howard revealed that this was perhaps the one place where the film strayed from the verbatim text of the interview. In actuality, Nixon made that telling remark in another interview, outside this adversarial series.Whether you enjoy the blood sport slant given to these proceedings though, or whether you watch this film wondering what might have been revealed under less pressured circumstances - you're bound to be engaged and educated by this reenactment. Furthermore, Ron Howard's Director's commentary is serious, intelligent, and worthwhile.The one disappointment connected with this DVD is the listing of the ""real"" interview among its bonus features. Actually, this feature includes only a few seconds of footage from the real interview. The rest of the feature is just another ""The Making of Frost/Nixon."" However, this film will probably pique your curiosity about the actual interviews and propel you to seek out that footage - so that you can judge for yourself how different inflections, editing, and context - might have recast this historic encounter.",4,Let's You and Him Fight,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,3521,"['movie', 'David', 'Frost', 'interview', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'verbal', 'boxing', 'match', 'part', 'interview', 'doubt', 'did', 'get', 'framed', 'way', 'result', 'Nixon', 'own', 'adversarial', 'spirit', 'result', 'hopes', 'many', 'members', 'Frost', 'staff', 'entertained', 'getting', 'breakthrough', 'admission', 'guilt', 'Nixon', 'regard', 'Watergate', 'However', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Director', 'film', 'said', 'combative', 'aspect', 'interview', 'was', 'enhanced', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'visually', 'dynamic.Some', 'further', 'poetic', 'license', 'taken', 'Frost', 'reputation', 'people', 'ringing', 'debate', 'are', 'shown', 'repeatedly', 'dismissing', 'Frost', 'playboy', 'Hollywood', 'interviewer', 'lightweight', 'unequal', 'task', 'asking', 'hard-edged', 'political', 'questions', 'particularly', 'unequal', 'task', 'getting', 'Nixon', 'confess', 'wrong-doing', 'Again', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Frost', 'reputation', 'was', 'skewed', 'way', 'purposes', 'projecting', 'encounter', 'Nixon', 'more', 'arresting', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'David', 'Goliath', 'contest.In', 'actuality', 'Frost', 'always', 'had', 'reputation', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'insightful', 'interviewer', 'When', 'had', 'American', 'interview', 'show', 'people', 'would', 'chuckle', 'bit', 'trademark', 'question', 'How', 'would', 'define', 'love', 'However', 'overall', 'was', 'usually', 'recognized', 'offbeat', 'personal', 'questions', 'did', 'end', 'producing', 'remarkably', 'intimate', 'revealing', 'portrait', 'subjects', 'always', 'been', 'known', 'good', 'listener', 'someone', 'able', 'catch', 'loose', 'thread', 'person', 'might', 'present', 'would', 'then', 'put', 'position', 'gently', 'sympathetically', 'pull', 'thread', 'unraveled', 'many', 'mysteries', 'subject', 'personality.So', 'watching', 'movie', 'found', 'wishing', 'interview', 'had', 'reality', 'purposes', 'dramatization', 'gotten', 'framed', 'less', 'war', 'more', 'exploration', 'wondered', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'elicited', 'Frost', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'pressured', 'abandon', 'usual', 'avuncular', 'style', 'favor', 'hard-hitting', 'nail', 'approach', 'would', 'level', 'have', 'preferred', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'entitled', 'not', 'Frost-slash-Nixon', 'Frost/Nixon', 'greater', 'spirit', 'cooperation', 'Frost-hyphen-Nixon', 'Frost-Nixon', 'moment', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'such', 'wish', 'was', 'wrong-headed', 'when', 'saw', 'Frost', 'elicit', 'what', 'became', 'advertising', 'trailer', 'film', 'Nixon', 'declaring', 'when', 'President', 'decrees', 'something', 'then', 'NOT', 'illegal', 'However', 'commentary', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'revealed', 'was', 'perhaps', 'one', 'place', 'where', 'film', 'strayed', 'verbatim', 'text', 'interview', 'actuality', 'Nixon', 'made', 'telling', 'remark', 'interview', 'adversarial', 'series.Whether', 'enjoy', 'blood', 'sport', 'slant', 'given', 'proceedings', 'watch', 'film', 'wondering', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'less', 'pressured', 'circumstances', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'engaged', 'educated', 'reenactment', 'Furthermore', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Director', 'commentary', 'serious', 'intelligent', 'worthwhile.The', 'one', 'disappointment', 'connected', 'DVD', 'listing', 'real', 'interview', 'bonus', 'features', 'Actually', 'feature', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'footage', 'real', 'interview', 'rest', 'feature', 'just', 'Making', 'Frost/Nixon', 'However', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'pique', 'curiosity', 'actual', 'interviews', 'propel', 'seek', 'out', 'footage', 'so', 'can', 'judge', 'how', 'different', 'inflections', 'editing', 'context', 'might', 'have', 'recast', 'historic', 'encounter']",Frost/Nixon

I had hoped to find some substantive political content and real insights into Nixon's character, but the whole affair felt a bit trivialized.Perhaps a game show host provides sub-par subject matter for the serious drama this was billed to be. Frost comes off as an arrogant philistine, making it hard to enjoy his hard-hitting questions. The most valuable part of the film was the scene at the end. Nixon proclaims his bold vision and hints at some illusions of grandeur, while Frost responds with adolescent boredom and an intense desire to escape this creepy man. Only at that point did the film make clear how fundamentally different the two men were. All along, I was waiting for Frost's apathy and superficiality to yield some sort of deeper meaning which never came.The mismatch between the two does provide some dramatic tension. But any meaningful differences are trivialized by overacting. ""When the president does it, it's not illegal"" seems cliche when there's such a treasure trove of information about this man.I would say, just read a book about Nixon's presidency.

I grew up in England and so have no personal connection to the events surrounding Nixon's term as president.So why do I have any interest at all in this film?It's a combination of the script and the acting. Nixon (Langella) and Frost (Sheen) are portrayed perfectly. The supporting cast is also strong and includes Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Oliver Platt and Toby Jones. The people making up Frost's research team clearly have something invested in the project. Like many of the American people, they are angry that Nixon was granted a pardon by President Ford. They want some kind of admission or guilt and an apology in order to achieve closure.Frost doesn't care about any of that. He's a playboy and a TV celebrity. He wants to further his career, become famous in America, and make a ton of money at the same time. He manages to convince Nixon to do an interview for his show and sets about soliciting companies and friends to provide the financial backing. But he's really more interested in spending time with his girlfriend (Hall) and experiencing the nightlife.Frost's next task is to convince his potential team members that he's truly motivated to give Nixon a hard time during the interviews. Once that's done, a contract is drawn up. Nixon stipulates that only one interview out of the four will be permitted to mention the Watergate scandal.During the first interview, Frost discovers what he's in for. Nixon is experienced at handling the media and gives long meandering answers that say very little. He completely dominates the interview. The remainder of the film shows Frost trying to up his game. One event in particular convinces him to treat the interviews seriously and he eventually throws himself into the task of uncovering new evidence.The first 90 minutes is used to set up the confrontation between the two in the final interview. It's so well handled that the showdown becomes gripping entertainment. As I mentioned, I have no personal connection to these events, but Ron Howard's direction makes me care. I find myself rooting for Frost in the hope that he could force Nixon into an admission that would help the American people achieve some kind of closure. The dialogue and acting in the final part of the film is explosive and some of the best I have ever witnessed.",4,Don't indulge in drunk dialing,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,2701,"['Frost/Nixon', '2008', 'Drama', 'History', '122', 'minutesDirected', 'Ron', 'HowardStarring', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Rebecca', 'HallLike', 'Doubt', 'Frost/Nixon', 'subject', 'matter', 'would', 'generally', 'bore', 'story', 'so', 'strong', 'capable', 'seizing', 'attention', 'holding', 'two', 'hours.I', 'remember', 'David', 'Frost', 'interviewing', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'when', 'was', 'teens', 'was', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'interested', 'grew', 'up', 'England', 'so', 'have', 'personal', 'connection', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Nixon', 'term', 'president.So', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'interest', 'film', 'combination', 'script', 'acting', 'Nixon', 'Langella', 'Frost', 'Sheen', 'are', 'portrayed', 'perfectly', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'strong', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'people', 'making', 'up', 'Frost', 'research', 'team', 'clearly', 'have', 'something', 'invested', 'project', 'many', 'American', 'people', 'are', 'angry', 'Nixon', 'was', 'granted', 'pardon', 'President', 'Ford', 'want', 'kind', 'admission', 'guilt', 'apology', 'order', 'achieve', 'closure.Frost', ""n't"", 'care', 'playboy', 'TV', 'celebrity', 'further', 'career', 'become', 'famous', 'America', 'make', 'ton', 'money', 'same', 'time', 'convince', 'Nixon', 'do', 'interview', 'show', 'sets', 'soliciting', 'companies', 'friends', 'provide', 'financial', 'backing', 'really', 'more', 'interested', 'spending', 'time', 'girlfriend', 'Hall', 'experiencing', 'nightlife.Frost', 'next', 'task', 'convince', 'potential', 'team', 'members', 'truly', 'motivated', 'give', 'Nixon', 'hard', 'time', 'interviews', 'done', 'contract', 'drawn', 'up', 'Nixon', 'only', 'one', 'interview', 'four', 'will', 'be', 'permitted', 'mention', 'Watergate', 'scandal.During', 'first', 'interview', 'Frost', 'what', 'Nixon', 'experienced', 'handling', 'media', 'long', 'meandering', 'answers', 'say', 'very', 'little', 'completely', 'interview', 'remainder', 'film', 'Frost', 'trying', 'up', 'game', 'One', 'event', 'particular', 'convinces', 'treat', 'interviews', 'seriously', 'eventually', 'task', 'uncovering', 'new', 'evidence.The', 'first', '90', 'minutes', 'used', 'set', 'up', 'confrontation', 'two', 'final', 'interview', 'so', 'well', 'handled', 'showdown', 'becomes', 'gripping', 'entertainment', 'mentioned', 'have', 'personal', 'connection', 'events', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'direction', 'care', 'find', 'rooting', 'Frost', 'hope', 'could', 'force', 'Nixon', 'admission', 'would', 'help', 'American', 'people', 'achieve', 'kind', 'closure', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'final', 'part', 'film', 'explosive', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed']",Frost/Nixon
1236379,A2S0UXAWV52WZ2,B001TH92N4,"Steven Fujita ""Steven Fujita, author of &#34;...","[0, 1]","The very first impression I got when the film started was that Frank Langella did not look nor sound like Richard Nixon.  But by the end of the film, I was totally convinced in his portrayal, and thus, a great character study of how a President's decisions affect that individual. Also, this is a great study of how public figures use each other.The beginning has David Frost, still popular, but not being taken seriously, trying to get back to the world stage of televion, and Richard Nixon, trying to rehabilitate himself in the public eye. Frost and his team want to ""get"" Nixon, and Nixon's team want to portray Nixon as being worthy of sainthood, well, at least the Nobel Peace Prize.The movie focuses on two things:  the preperations the teams were doing for their man, and the condensed and sometimes modified from original questions and answers from the two. Nixon keeps getting the better of Frost, but Frost delivers a knock-out blow in the last round.  Frost wins, but when the two men say their good-byes, each has earned the respect of the other.It's not a 100% truthful. But, how many true-life movies are 100% true? The special features of the dvd are great because a couple of the extras point out that this is ""fictionalised"" truth.  In addition to the real Frost/Nixon comparison, there is a ""making of"" featurette, which is interesting, and a nice piece on the Nixon library.As far as the acting, Frank Langella does an extremely convincing job of presenting a man, whether true or not, haunted by his legacy, yet angered by the fact that his accomplishments on China and the Soviet Union are ignored.  One that starts out belittling his adversary, but in the end, respecting him as a worthy opponent.Frank Langella's performance is so compelling, I think it rejected a viewpoint the film wanted to present.  In the special features, it's noted that Howard wanted to examine the issue of the abuse of power and I think he wanted to show that President's abuse power on purpose. However, for me, what came out is how troubled Nixon was with all the grey areas a President's decision falls under. And if he does abuse his power, he either convinces himself that it isn't so, or does it thinking that in the end,it is for the greater good.Regardless of the filmmaker's intent, Langella's character study, showing the motivations behind public figures to use each other to rise in the public's eye, and the calculations behind a ""face to face"" makes this into a must see movie for me.",5,"Frank Langella at his Best, and Also a Great Story",1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,2499,"['very', 'first', 'impression', 'got', 'when', 'film', 'started', 'was', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'sound', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'totally', 'convinced', 'portrayal', 'thus', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'how', 'President', 'decisions', 'affect', 'individual', 'Also', 'great', 'study', 'how', 'public', 'figures', 'use', 'other.The', 'beginning', 'David', 'Frost', 'still', 'popular', 'not', 'being', 'taken', 'seriously', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'world', 'stage', 'televion', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'trying', 'rehabilitate', 'public', 'eye', 'Frost', 'team', 'want', 'get', 'Nixon', 'Nixon', 'team', 'want', 'portray', 'Nixon', 'being', 'worthy', 'sainthood', 'well', 'least', 'Nobel', 'Peace', 'Prize.The', 'movie', 'two', 'things', 'preperations', 'teams', 'were', 'doing', 'man', 'condensed', 'sometimes', 'modified', 'original', 'questions', 'answers', 'two', 'Nixon', 'getting', 'better', 'Frost', 'Frost', 'knock-out', 'blow', 'last', 'round', 'Frost', 'wins', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'say', 'good-byes', 'earned', 'respect', 'other.It', 'not', '100', '%', 'truthful', 'how', 'many', 'true-life', 'movies', 'are', '100', '%', 'true', 'special', 'features', 'dvd', 'are', 'great', 'couple', 'extras', 'point', 'out', 'fictionalised', 'truth', 'addition', 'real', 'Frost/Nixon', 'comparison', 'making', 'featurette', 'interesting', 'nice', 'piece', 'Nixon', 'library.As', 'far', 'acting', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'job', 'presenting', 'man', 'true', 'not', 'haunted', 'legacy', 'yet', 'angered', 'fact', 'accomplishments', 'China', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'are', 'ignored', 'One', 'out', 'belittling', 'adversary', 'end', 'respecting', 'worthy', 'opponent.Frank', 'Langella', 'performance', 'so', 'compelling', 'think', 'rejected', 'viewpoint', 'film', 'wanted', 'present', 'special', 'features', 'noted', 'Howard', 'wanted', 'examine', 'issue', 'abuse', 'power', 'think', 'wanted', 'show', 'President', 'abuse', 'power', 'purpose', 'However', 'what', 'came', 'out', 'how', 'troubled', 'Nixon', 'was', 'grey', 'areas', 'President', 'decision', 'abuse', 'power', 'either', ""n't"", 'so', 'thinking', 'end', 'greater', 'good.Regardless', 'filmmaker', 'intent', 'Langella', 'character', 'study', 'showing', 'motivations', 'public', 'figures', 'use', 'other', 'rise', 'public', 'eye', 'calculations', 'face', 'face', 'must', 'see', 'movie']",Frost/Nixon

Like any play or fictionalised screenplay based on a historical event (Amadeus, the Killing Fields), careful thought needs to be given about what is fact and what is fiction.  The problem is that, without a roadmap, it is impossible to know what really happened as it is depicted in the film without either a roadmap or researching the events of the documentary and watching the debates themselves.  They exist on YouTube, of course, and it would be good to watch them all.I enjoyed the movie, mostly because all of the characters were so vivid. David Frost reminded me a lot of someone I know, and watching Frank Langella play Richard Nixon because you'd find yourself wondering how similar he was and how dissimilar from Nixon he was (likewise for Anthony Hopkins playing Nixon in the Oliver Stone movie). Very interesting touches, such as the look on Frost's face when he first starts interviewing Nixon and realizes that he's WAY out of his league with the fish he's roped. Nixon's hunger to be back in the spotlight is palpable, although his greed in ringing in the big bucks is a questionable distraction that is only seen in the first parts of the film. Kevin Bacon is fantastic as Nixon's devoted Marine chief of staff, whose devotion is not entirely understandable until you watch the bonus materials (which are excellent) that include interviews with the devoted people who run the Richard Nixon Presidential library, which started life differently than other presidential libraries, mainly due to the cloud over Nixon's resignation - it was only officially set up in 2007, three years after fellow two-termer Bill Clinton's. The complexity of his character is remarkable - he eggs Frost on to become a worthy adversary, despite the fact that he was chosen for the interview mainly on the basis that he was a lightweight. The contradiction of the coexistence of his egotism with his low self-esteem is also fascinating to behold.Some quibbles with the film - I find it odd that David Frost is described as a playboy, but we only get hints of this. I also dislike the key ""drunk Nixon phone call"" scene/dream sequence, which strikes me as stagy. How many people who watch this film will assume that it was based on a real event?

Maybe it's because he performed the role on stage with Michael Sheen who deserved an nomination for playing Sir David Frost. Sheen was recently honored with an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire). Maybe it's a consolation prize but he also played Frost on stage with Langella as Nixon. They brought the stage to film with thanks to seventies icon actor turned director Ron Howard. This film is under-stated and highly ignored at the Box Office. Despite it's top notch cast, the movie appeared in the shadows of other films but no less brilliant. There are times when you even might shed a tear for Nixon with Langella's performance and that's magic. Frank Langella humanizes Nixon on film into a full-dimensional character rather than caricature. Michael Sheen OBE equally does the same for Sir David Frost who interviewed the likes of the Bee Gees and other seventy icons. As the interviewer, Frost has the difficult job of bringing tough questions against Nixon. I loved Kevin Bacon as Nixon's right-hand man and Patty McCormack as his wife but I thought that they should have used her more. Bacon is a surprisingly ally in Nixon's corner who is very protective of the man despite his faults. Still it's Frost and Nixon in a tough interview, the preparations, and funding since nobody in Hollywood wanted to touch the Nixon interview.

As I grew older I became captivated by the Watergate scandal and with Richard Nixon's resignation as President of the United Sates. ""Frost/Nixon"" dramatizes Nixon's attempt to salvage his public image after his fall from public office by appearing in a series of syndicated TV interviews with David Frost, a washed-up interviewer whose success on American television eluded him. The film also details Frost's attempt to make a name for himself as a celebrated journalist by interviewing the most disgraced President in American history. When one watches ""Frost/Nixon"" the battle between Nixon and Frost during the interviews is evident as they try to outwit the other with only one man coming out on top. The performances, especially by Frank Langella, are superb. He actually gives an even greater performance than Anthony Hopkins who played Nixon in an autobiography back in the late '90's. The direction by Ron Howard is cunning and stylish and most critics agree this is his best work. The two hours flew by as I watched this filmed as the movie is fast-paced and involving.

Nixon (Frank Langella).  Nixon has resigned the Presidency but never apologized to the American people for his part in the Watergate cover-up.  Every major news organization has attempted to gain access to Nixon for an interview and been turned down.  Frost, not a newsman but an entertainment figure, succeeds only because he held out the carrot of a huge paycheck.Based on the stage play by Peter Morgan, the film takes us behind the scenes as Frost puts everything on the line both financially and professionally.  Now that he has bought Nixon's cooperation, he must interest a network, treat Nixon and his handlers with kid gloves, mediate among researchers eager to crucify him, and find a way to seduce him into making damaging admissions on primetime TV.Langella is simply extraordinary as Nixon.  Though he doesn't resemble Nixon physically, he captures his essence with the gruff voice, stooped posture, and social awkwardness.  His Nixon can turn on the charm, hijack an interview, lose his temper, or express indignation as required.  This is a superb performance and Langella was rightfully nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his work in this film.Sheen plays Frost as a man well over his head but never given to pessimism or discouraged by those on his staff who feel the interviews are allowing Nixon to ramble on and avoid tough questions.  His Frost is in awe of Nixon yet finds a way to go for the kill.Suspense is created as the interviews progress and Nixon checkmates Frost's attempts to elicit serious answers.  A lifetime in politics has made Nixon an expert in how to deflect a question, provide half answers, and smile his way out of a seemingly tough spot.  It gets to a point at which Frost's confidence wavers and he fears the interviews will be his show biz swan song.The film's stage origins are evident, but director Ron Howard does open up the proceedings, especially in a scene contrasting the arrivals of Frost and Nixon at the TV studio.  Frost arrives to polite applause from celebrity-watchers.  Frost acknowledges the small crowd politely, just as Nixon in a limousine draped with American and Presidential flags and accompanied by his entourage, appears.  Visually, the scene suggests David taking on Goliath.  The expression on Frost's face indicates he knows his reputation is at stake and he will be facing a formidable adversary.The movie co-stars Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Oliver Platt, and former 1950's child star Patty McCormack.Bonus features include deleted scenes, a making-of feature, commentary with Ron Howard, and a look at the actual people and places depicted in the movie.",5,A Spectacular Performance!,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,2799,"['Frost/Nixon', 'riveting', 'motion', 'picture', 'historic', 'series', 'television', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'David', 'Frost', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'former', 'President', 'Richard', 'M.', 'Nixon', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Nixon', 'resigned', 'Presidency', 'never', 'apologized', 'American', 'people', 'part', 'Watergate', 'cover-up', 'major', 'news', 'organization', 'attempted', 'gain', 'access', 'Nixon', 'interview', 'been', 'turned', 'down', 'Frost', 'not', 'newsman', 'entertainment', 'figure', 'only', 'held', 'out', 'carrot', 'huge', 'paycheck.Based', 'stage', 'play', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'film', 'scenes', 'Frost', 'everything', 'line', 'financially', 'professionally', 'Now', 'bought', 'Nixon', 'cooperation', 'must', 'interest', 'network', 'treat', 'Nixon', 'handlers', 'kid', 'gloves', 'mediate', 'researchers', 'eager', 'crucify', 'find', 'way', 'seduce', 'making', 'damaging', 'admissions', 'primetime', 'TV.Langella', 'simply', 'extraordinary', 'Nixon', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'Nixon', 'physically', 'essence', 'gruff', 'voice', 'stooped', 'posture', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'Nixon', 'can', 'turn', 'charm', 'hijack', 'interview', 'lose', 'temper', 'express', 'indignation', 'required', 'superb', 'performance', 'Langella', 'was', 'rightfully', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'work', 'film.Sheen', 'Frost', 'man', 'well', 'head', 'never', 'given', 'pessimism', 'discouraged', 'staff', 'who', 'feel', 'interviews', 'are', 'allowing', 'Nixon', 'ramble', 'avoid', 'tough', 'questions', 'Frost', 'awe', 'Nixon', 'yet', 'way', 'go', 'kill.Suspense', 'created', 'interviews', 'progress', 'Nixon', 'Frost', 'attempts', 'elicit', 'serious', 'answers', 'lifetime', 'politics', 'made', 'Nixon', 'expert', 'how', 'deflect', 'question', 'provide', 'half', 'answers', 'smile', 'way', 'seemingly', 'tough', 'spot', 'point', 'Frost', 'confidence', 'wavers', 'interviews', 'will', 'be', 'show', 'biz', 'swan', 'song.The', 'film', 'stage', 'origins', 'are', 'evident', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'open', 'up', 'proceedings', 'especially', 'scene', 'contrasting', 'arrivals', 'Frost', 'Nixon', 'TV', 'studio', 'Frost', 'polite', 'applause', 'celebrity-watchers', 'Frost', 'small', 'crowd', 'politely', 'just', 'Nixon', 'limousine', 'draped', 'American', 'Presidential', 'flags', 'accompanied', 'entourage', 'Visually', 'scene', 'David', 'taking', 'Goliath', 'expression', 'Frost', 'face', 'reputation', 'stake', 'will', 'be', 'facing', 'formidable', 'adversary.The', 'movie', 'co-stars', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'former', '1950', 'child', 'star', 'Patty', 'McCormack.Bonus', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making-of', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'look', 'actual', 'people', 'places', 'depicted', 'movie']",Frost/Nixon

After meeting Frost, Nixon and his staff believe the man to be a journalistic lightweight and believe that the interviews will be Nixon's catalyst for once again entering into power.  Even though he spent a lot of time working and had an amazing research staff, Nixon controls each of the first three days of shooting.  However, (in a completely fictionalized scene) the night before the final interview Frost receives a telephone call from a drunken Nixon.  The call reveals a deeply personal side of Nixon, but also encourages Frost to be more aggressive during the final day of taping in which he ends up taunting Nixon into a confession-of-sorts about Watergate and the cover-up.I have to admit that I was a bit leery about seeing FROST/NIXON. I had heard wonderful things about the acting, but that Nixon was unfairly portrayed as an evil mastermind.  The overall tone of the film is definitely NOT sympathetic to Richard Nixon. Watching the film I got the distinct impression that director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan wanted the audience to have the point of view of Frost's research team, James Reston, Jr. (Sam Rockwell) and Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt).Despite the overall tone, the film actually does present a decent portrayal of Nixon. Nixon was ambitious and sometimes almost ruthless.  However, he was also a decent American who overcame some incredible odds.  He loved his country and his family and was a master orator and debater.  Frank Langella, reprising the role from Broadway, gives one of the most humanizing examples of Nixon ever seen in a Hollywood film.  In most movies, Nixon's foibles and are exaggerated and he is presented as a caricature.  Langella doesn't do this and offers viewers a picture of Nixon that most people would rather reject, that of a human being.I really enjoyed FROST/NIXON. It is a drama and there are moments that are drawn out of effect.  Also, the script is a tad too tidy, as though it was put together using a by-the-numbers formula for dramatic movies.  Also, even though the movie does offer the closest thing to the ""real"" Nixon that has been seen on screen, the overall negative tone of the film towards Nixon will probably turn some people off.  Like W., FROST/NIXON people on the far left of the political spectrum will probably find the movie too light on Nixon, while those on the far right will find it too harsh and negative. The truth is that Langella's Nixon actually falls somewhere inbetween and is closer to the real Richard Nixon than either side wants people to believe.Recommended for modern history buffs and those who enjoy good, conversational dramas.",5,Looking For Nixon,1239667200,"04 14, 2009",2009,3202,"['Adapted', 'fairly', 'successful', 'stage', 'play', 'FROST/NIXON', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'interview', 'process', 'sessions', 'took', 'place', 'world', 'media', 'darling', 'David', 'Frost', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'former', 'President', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Frank', 'Langella', '1977', 'film', 'Frost', 'get', 'back', 'big', 'time', 'television', 'America', 'gaining', 'exclusive', 'set', 'interviews', 'Nixon', 'be', 'broadcast', 'network', 'television', 'Nixon', 'been', 'living', 'relative', 'seclusion', 'resigning', 'Presidency', 'too', 'longs', 'be', 'limelight', 'again', 'meeting', 'Frost', 'Nixon', 'staff', 'believe', 'man', 'be', 'journalistic', 'lightweight', 'believe', 'interviews', 'will', 'be', 'Nixon', 'catalyst', 'once', 'again', 'entering', 'power', 'Even', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'working', 'had', 'amazing', 'research', 'staff', 'Nixon', 'first', 'three', 'days', 'shooting', 'However', 'completely', 'fictionalized', 'scene', 'night', 'final', 'interview', 'Frost', 'telephone', 'call', 'drunken', 'Nixon', 'call', 'deeply', 'personal', 'side', 'Nixon', 'also', 'Frost', 'be', 'more', 'aggressive', 'final', 'day', 'taping', 'up', 'taunting', 'Nixon', 'confession-of-sorts', 'Watergate', 'cover-up.I', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'leery', 'seeing', 'FROST/NIXON', 'had', 'heard', 'wonderful', 'things', 'acting', 'Nixon', 'was', 'unfairly', 'portrayed', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'sympathetic', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Watching', 'film', 'got', 'distinct', 'impression', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'writer', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'wanted', 'audience', 'have', 'point', 'view', 'Frost', 'research', 'team', 'James', 'Reston', 'Jr.', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Bob', 'Zelnick', 'Oliver', 'Platt', '.Despite', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'actually', 'present', 'decent', 'portrayal', 'Nixon', 'Nixon', 'was', 'ambitious', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'ruthless', 'However', 'was', 'also', 'decent', 'American', 'who', 'overcame', 'incredible', 'odds', 'loved', 'country', 'family', 'was', 'master', 'orator', 'debater', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'reprising', 'role', 'Broadway', 'one', 'most', 'humanizing', 'examples', 'Nixon', 'ever', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'most', 'movies', 'Nixon', 'foibles', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'presented', 'caricature', 'Langella', ""n't"", 'do', 'viewers', 'picture', 'Nixon', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'rather', 'reject', 'human', 'being.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'FROST/NIXON', 'drama', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'drawn', 'effect', 'Also', 'script', 'tad', 'too', 'tidy', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'using', 'by-the-numbers', 'formula', 'dramatic', 'movies', 'Also', 'even', 'movie', 'offer', 'closest', 'thing', 'real', 'Nixon', 'been', 'seen', 'screen', 'overall', 'negative', 'tone', 'film', 'towards', 'Nixon', 'will', 'probably', 'turn', 'people', 'off', 'W.', 'FROST/NIXON', 'people', 'far', 'left', 'political', 'spectrum', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'movie', 'too', 'light', 'Nixon', 'far', 'right', 'will', 'find', 'too', 'harsh', 'negative', 'truth', 'Langella', 'Nixon', 'actually', 'somewhere', 'inbetween', 'closer', 'real', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'side', 'people', 'believe.Recommended', 'modern', 'history', 'buffs', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'conversational', 'dramas']",Frost/Nixon
1236390,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,B001TH92N4,Unlucky Frank,"[2, 5]","The drama behind a Popular Non-American TV Host like David Frost, trying to wrest a criminal confession out of disgraced Republican President, Richard M. Nixon was hardly suspenseful or even compelling viewing when it first happened. Getting Nixon to expose himself with that single mad Colonel Nathan Jessup admission (Which I won't divulge here. Think A FEW GOOD MEN.) was hardly surprising considering his meglomanical personality. But, to write a play about it (I had no idea there was one), and then use that play as the basis for a screenplay is really trying to pull something grand out of a small historical Television event. It was no big deal at the time, and is now only a small footnote in the entire history of The Watergate Scandal. This film also reminded me of Clooney's GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, which I felt looked great, but also contained a lot of empty conflict only to arrive at another small media event. There isn't a very compelling drama leading up to the big showdown interview between the two combatants. Director Ron Howard tries to fuel the non-drama with some nice montage work ala Oliver Stone, providing some brief Watergate history and Frost's team research into the whole affair. He also adds a heart thumping dramatic score to build suspense. It's a little overwrought and at times, distracting. But, the entire drama of a Pop TV icon going toe-to-toe with a very intelligent self-destructive politician is hardly edge-of-your-seat material for a two hour film. I don't even know if it's even much of an important footnote in the entire Nixonian debacle.The performances feel like smarmy Saturday Night Live parodies. Frank Langela tries too hard to do an imitation of Nixon, instead of acting him. Sorry film critics, he doesn't sound or behave in any way like Nixon. At times, his vocalization of Nixon was just downright annoying. Imitations and impressions are a big no-no in the craft of acting. Anthony Hopkins did a much better job of acting Richard Nixon, instead of trying to do an imitation or an impression of him. (A very important rule to follow if you work with Oliver Stone.) Even though Hopkins looked nothing like Nixon, not once did I believe I was watching Hopkins the actor, imitating Nixon. He embodies Nixon. Of course, working out with Oliver Stone's amazing screenplay went a long long way to provide Hopkins with some really juicy hardcore dialogue to bend his choppers around. Langela must have known comparisons would be forthcoming. Langela's performance is brave, and he has a few terrific moments as Nixon, but they're not enough to push the lack of drama into a great acting vehicle. Part of the fault lies with the director and the screenwriter. The conflict here is just not that compelling. Ho-hum.Michael Sheen is not bad. However, he looks and feels more like Austin Powers than David Frost. The film has a lot of bad British wigs that look like bad British haircuts. (Maybe the most realistic part of the production.) And not once did I believe I was watching David Frost interviewing Richard Nixon.Stick with the Original Frost/Nixon Interviews. Pieces of them are included on the DVD Extras. But, not enough to warrant a purchase.Fairly overrated, very disappointing, and surely one of Ron Howard's lesser films.3 Stars for the some nice production design, decent direction, and for some interesting history leading up to the event. But, not enough compelling drama, and too many parody performances to propel this into Classic film status.Rent or buy Oliver Stone's NIXON, Michael Mann's THE INSIDER, and Rob Reiner's A FEW GOOD MEN instead.

Frost saw it as the opportunity to reach a new, bigger audience and also to gain some credibility with the news media. Instead, he found himself as much of a pariah as Nixon had become in the aftermath of the Watergate break-in and his resignation. Nixon likewise hoped to regain credibility and be welcomed back into the political fold.Others here have suggested that there's some sort of political agenda in the release of this film. Instead, I'd suggest that the purpose was to dig into the personalities of two people who sought both public attention and approval. Both got that approval but it came with a price that impacted their decision making, careers and lives.Frost puts together a series of TV interviews with Nixon and finds that, because he isn't a ""respected"" journalist, that no network wants the interviews. His supporters fall by the wayside as well when they realize that the networks won't support the program and that Frost will have to independently finance the project and syndicate it himself. All the while Frost manages to maintain his jolly outgoing personality in many respects the opposite of Nixon but as we discover he is, in many respects, a lot like him as well. Writer Peter Morgan structures their scenes together as if they are two boxers each jabbing at the other and each waiting for the moment to deliver that knock-out punch.Adapted by Peter Morgan from his own play ""Frost/Nixon"" manages to break through the showbiz personality of David Frost and the icy demeanor of Richard Nixon to discover the people underneath it all. Frank Langella gives an Oscar worthy performance here digging into Richard Nixon the man in ways that previous performers have missed. Michael Sheen likewise does a terrific job keeping pace with Langella in every scene they are in together. The only flaw that I can think of is that I would have loved to see more of their banter between their interviews within the context of the interviews themselves.The extras include a ""Making of"" featurette, interviews with the people that worked with Frost on the 1977 series of TV interviews, Frost himself, actors Sheen and Langella. We also see excerpts from the real Frost/Nixon interviews and this particularly featurette compares those interviews with the film itself. There's a terrific commentary track by Ron Howard filled with a lot of info although there are long lulls between comments on occasion.Discovering Secrets: The People and Places Behind the Story interviews both the Smiths the Republican family that hosted the interviews along with Frost, Langella and others about discovering the ""character"" for Richard Nixon.The U-Control feature allows viewers to watch picture-in-picture behind-the-scenes movie while watching the film. Rounding things out are a series of deleted scenes.We also get a featurette on how the Nixon Library cooperated in the making of the film.

1236395,AP3B615GM191G,B001TH92N4,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","After the Watergate event that precipitated the demise of President Nixon, the nation anxiously waited for the interview that would very likely define the Nixon legacy.  ""Frost/Nixon"" chronicles the process behind (and during) that very interview.For a basic plot summary, the film looks at two primary areas: the creation of the interview, which includes the odd choice of David Frost (Michael Sheen), and then the actual interview of Nixon (Frank Langella) itself, depicted as a battle of intellectual wits between both camps.What really makes this movie stand out is the incredible tension that director Ron Howard creates.  Because of the deceit that Watergate perpetuated, as well as the pardon of Nixon by Gerald Ford that left much of the nation feeling that justice had not been served, this interview felt more important than just a few hours of airtime.  Howard really captures that intensity, especially towards the end during the part of the interview that is now so well-known.On a quick note, Langella is as good of a ""Nixon"" as is humanly possible.  At times, when the camera angle and his posture is right, you'll think that the former President is actually onscreen himself.If you lived through that time period and remember it well, this film will likely flood you with a wave of nostalgia (both good and bad).  However, I was born in 1985 and was STILL entranced by this film, knowing hardly anything going in about the interview.Thus, for all fans of political/cultural dramas, this is a worthwhile watch.  It could have done a few things better, but overall it accomplishes its mission nicely: to re-create the importance and cultural relevance of those Frost/Nixon interviews.",4,A Battle Of Intellects,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,1698,"['Watergate', 'event', 'precipitated', 'demise', 'President', 'Nixon', 'nation', 'anxiously', 'waited', 'interview', 'would', 'very', 'likely', 'define', 'Nixon', 'legacy', 'Frost/Nixon', 'process', 'very', 'interview.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'two', 'primary', 'areas', 'creation', 'interview', 'odd', 'choice', 'David', 'Frost', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'then', 'actual', 'interview', 'Nixon', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'depicted', 'battle', 'intellectual', 'wits', 'really', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'incredible', 'tension', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'deceit', 'Watergate', 'perpetuated', 'as', 'well', 'pardon', 'Nixon', 'Gerald', 'Ford', 'left', 'much', 'nation', 'feeling', 'justice', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'served', 'interview', 'felt', 'more', 'important', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'airtime', 'Howard', 'really', 'intensity', 'especially', 'end', 'part', 'interview', 'now', 'so', 'well-known.On', 'quick', 'note', 'Langella', 'as', 'good', 'Nixon', 'humanly', 'possible', 'times', 'when', 'camera', 'angle', 'posture', 'right', ""'ll"", 'think', 'former', 'President', 'actually', 'onscreen', 'himself.If', 'lived', 'time', 'period', 'remember', 'well', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'flood', 'wave', 'nostalgia', 'good', 'bad', 'However', 'was', 'born', '1985', 'was', 'STILL', 'entranced', 'film', 'knowing', 'hardly', 'anything', 'going', 'interview.Thus', 'fans', 'political/cultural', 'dramas', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'few', 'things', 'better', 'overall', 'mission', 'nicely', 're-create', 'importance', 'cultural', 'relevance', 'Frost/Nixon', 'interviews']",Frost/Nixon
