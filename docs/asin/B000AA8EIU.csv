My best friend dragged me to the theater to see what he called a good science fiction movie. To my surprise, it was a combination of martial arts and science fiction. I loved it. I have seen it on my satellite service once or twice over the years, but I decided to own it. I have to say the movie content was still as good as I remember, but the presentation or DVD transfer was not. I guess the manufacturer did not have much to work with due to age, and this was the best they could do. The movie is ""campy"", dated and utterly ridiculous by any standard, but fun. I just wish it looked better. In any case, I can live with it, I'm a fan. If you remember this one, you will live with it too.",3,Ahh...the memories.,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,749,"['remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'best', 'friend', 'dragged', 'theater', 'see', 'what', 'called', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'surprise', 'was', 'combination', 'martial', 'arts', 'science', 'fiction', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'satellite', 'service', 'once', 'twice', 'years', 'decided', 'own', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'content', 'was', 'still', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'not', 'guess', 'manufacturer', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'work', 'due', 'age', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'do', 'movie', 'campy', 'dated', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'standard', 'fun', 'just', 'wish', 'looked', 'better', 'case', 'can', 'live', ""'m"", 'fan', 'remember', 'one', 'will', 'live', 'too']",Inframan

Nunez ""Ian""","[3, 3]","I was in a flashback moment when I remembered when I was young and went to the movies with my parents because I saw the trailer of Inframan when it came out in the 70's. This was great stuff back then when you were a kid.I never seen this movie again since, so I looked it up at Amazon and there it was. I ordered it along with a other DVD of a childhood memory,Ultraman the complete series. And for a great price too, and got it two days before the estimated time.Anyway I watched Inframan and was not to happy over the video quality but I finally seen the movie that I have not seen since my childhood,and the other DVD set of Utraman was way better quality in video recording and cost less. so I did o.k.I would wait to find a better recording of Inframan.

925022,A2Z1B15F3Y8YU8,B000AA8EIU,Valmont,"[0, 0]","This Hong Kong superhero movie is in the same vein as classic Ultraman episodes.  It's a great deal of fun for fans of cheezy martial arts superheros, and is completely ridiculous.  The costumes are silly, the sound effects are over the top, and the dubbing is absolutely laughable, but that's what makes it fun.  Inframan is a really goofy name in and of itself (I expect they are making reference to Ultraman, but &#34;infra&#34; means &#34;below/beneath&#34;).  The dialogue contains marvelous moments, and the translation is probably a bit too literal; case in point, the villain is translated as &#34;Princess Dragon Mom.&#34;Bottom line, if you like stuff like Ultraman and other tokusatsu shows/movies, don't pass this up.",5,Oodles of cheezy fun!,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,729,"['Hong', 'Kong', 'superhero', 'movie', 'same', 'vein', 'classic', 'Ultraman', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'fans', 'cheezy', 'martial', 'arts', 'superheros', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'costumes', 'are', 'silly', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'dubbing', 'absolutely', 'laughable', 'what', 'fun', 'Inframan', 'really', 'goofy', 'name', 'expect', 'are', 'making', 'reference', 'Ultraman', '34', 'infra', '34', '34', 'below/beneath', '34', 'dialogue', 'marvelous', 'moments', 'translation', 'probably', 'bit', 'too', 'literal', 'case', 'point', 'villain', 'translated', '34', 'Princess', 'Dragon', 'Mom.', '34', 'Bottom', 'line', 'like', 'stuff', 'Ultraman', 'other', 'tokusatsu', 'shows/movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up']",Inframan
