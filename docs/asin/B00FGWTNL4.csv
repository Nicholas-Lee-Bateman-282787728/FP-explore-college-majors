Triumph has 4 or 5 songs....WHY?  They have already released their entire concert on DVD/CD a couple of years ago.  Same with Priest......they released their entire video concert on 30th anniv of the Screaming for Vengeance CD reissue.

1671672,A3JMGWVMC4SD9G,B00FGWTNL4,D,"[15, 16]","I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. Obvious from the cover, it was a &#34;highlight&#34; of the US Festival. A TRUE music fan would have been exstatic to have a boxed set of this....showcasing EVERY band's FULL length performance over the three day festival. I would have PAID to have this for sure. This DVD is only a &#34;cliff notes&#34; version and a poor one at that. I was extremely disappointed over the fact that Berlin's song wasn't even a full song....maybe 30 seconds of coverage/music of their performance while the rest was listening to Mark Goodman talk and watching a bunch of people dance. I was even more upset that Mark Goodman once again talked over U2's performance. Why couldn't the interview portion be at the beginning or the end....NOT DURING!!!!This DVD could have been really something amazing had it been full performance. Maybe they will get wise and release it in full format.

1671674,A3LRKDF5WU4ZDO,B00FGWTNL4,"E. Carter ""The Marching Bugler""","[0, 0]","Yes, some performances are interrupted by commentary, but my biggest complaint is that two of those are during U2's performance, and U2's song, Electric Co., is shortened by very choppy editing.  For example, they cut out much of Bono's breathtaking climb up the rope ladder to the top of the rigging.  Then, once they show him up there, you can see Bono gesturing to someone to come to him.  What they cut out is Bono having his tall, white flag delivered to him which he then drags halfway across the top and holds up high just before throwing it in dramatic fashion off the canopy from which it flutters down about 50 or 100 feet to the bottom. All this is accompanied by dramatic guitar riffs and drums from the band.  All you get instead is about one second of Bono climbing back down the ladder and then a very obvious cut in the music and video to the point where Bono re-enters from stage left at the end of the song.  I had even less patience for that edit when the very next performance was more of ... Triumph?  They had already shown three songs from Triumph in the Day 2 footage, so why they had to cut part of U2 and then use up more DVD space on Triumph is beyond me.  The unedited version of Electric Co. was shown on Showtime in the 1980s, so I'm sure you can find good quality video of it somewhere.  Otherwise, get the Red Rocks DVDUnder a Blood Red Sky - Deluxe Edition CD/DVDand you'll get the idea.  Bono climbs up high in that one too.All that said, after watching Day 2, I wondered how anyone who was there was able to hear anything on Day 3.  That Day 2 Heavy Metal day was LOUD!  If you're parents don't hear well, they were probably at Day 2 of the US Festival.  I enjoyed those performances, though.  You just have to turn it up louder when Judas Priest comes out.If you can watch it for free, it might be worth it, but don't pay for it.",2,Not Worth Paying For,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,1865,"['Yes', 'performances', 'are', 'interrupted', 'commentary', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'two', 'are', 'U2', 'performance', 'U2', 'song', 'Electric', 'Co.', 'shortened', 'very', 'choppy', 'editing', 'example', 'cut', 'out', 'much', 'Bono', 'breathtaking', 'climb', 'rope', 'ladder', 'top', 'rigging', 'Then', 'once', 'show', 'there', 'can', 'see', 'Bono', 'gesturing', 'someone', 'come', 'What', 'cut', 'out', 'Bono', 'having', 'tall', 'white', 'flag', 'delivered', 'then', 'halfway', 'top', 'up', 'high', 'just', 'throwing', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'canopy', 'down', 'about', '50', '100', 'feet', 'bottom', 'accompanied', 'dramatic', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'drums', 'band', 'get', 'instead', 'one', 'second', 'Bono', 'climbing', 'back', 'ladder', 'then', 'very', 'obvious', 'cut', 'music', 'video', 'point', 'where', 'Bono', 're-enters', 'stage', 'left', 'end', 'song', 'had', 'even', 'less', 'patience', 'edit', 'when', 'very', 'next', 'performance', 'was', 'more', 'Triumph', 'had', 'already', 'shown', 'three', 'songs', 'Triumph', 'Day', '2', 'footage', 'so', 'why', 'had', 'cut', 'part', 'U2', 'then', 'use', 'up', 'more', 'DVD', 'space', 'Triumph', 'unedited', 'version', 'Electric', 'Co.', 'was', 'shown', 'Showtime', '1980s', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'find', 'good', 'quality', 'video', 'somewhere', 'Otherwise', 'get', 'Red', 'Rocks', 'DVDUnder', 'Blood', 'Red', 'Sky', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'CD/DVDand', ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'Bono', 'up', 'high', 'one', 'too.All', 'said', 'watching', 'Day', '2', 'wondered', 'how', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'able', 'hear', 'anything', 'Day', '3', '2', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'day', 'was', 'LOUD', ""'re"", 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'well', 'were', 'probably', 'Day', '2', 'US', 'Festival', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'though', 'just', 'have', 'turn', 'up', 'louder', 'when', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'can', 'watch', 'free', 'might', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay']",US Festival 1983: Days 1-3

Losing my 14 year old brother was the highlight of our day. But hey! he's my brother and I knew he would survive and maybe learn about life, love and the pursuit of the party, lol.

1671680,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00FGWTNL4,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[15, 18]","I&#8217;ve already read the previous reviews posted here and hope I can add a bit of clarity to the situation &#8211; as I seem to be one of the few reviewers who wasn&#8217;t at the California concert in 1983. (With an estimated 670,000 people there, I can now see why so many reviewers commented on that.). But I&#8217;m on the East Coast and not a fan of huge festivals where you can&#8217;t hear the performers, let alone see them.As another person pointed out, many of the performers who were at the Festival (which Steve Wozniak dished out $22 million to mount as a free event) had contracts that limited whether their performance could be recorded and, if  so, how many songs were allowed. This was, of course, before iPhones, though there were camcorders and I&#8217;m guessing that there is some private video out there of the performances not on this DVD.  If your favorite act is not here, I understand, but if it is, then you MIGHT consider it, but know what you are getting.The DVD has 3 days of programs. Each one fills 44 minutes so it is obvious that this was originally meant for commercial TV or &#8211; most probably MTV. I say that because the performances are separated by comments from &#8220;Woz&#8221; as well as MTV DJ Mark Goodman. These interviews are more recent.  At the end of each day&#8217;s program there are two sets of credits. The credits from 2003 are given but also a set from 2009, which may be when Goodman and Woz added their commentary. And now it is being released in 2013 by MVD.The images are standard 4:3 resolution &#8211; not wide screen &#8211; which again gives the impression that this was for television viewing. And don&#8217;t expect Hi-def or hi-fi sound . For a guy who invented one of the first PCs, I was surprised at the low video resolution on this DVD. The bands vary in style and name. Berlin is here but since their hit from the &#8220;Top Gun&#8221; soundtrack went off the charts, there&#8217;s been little heard from them. And here is U2 EARLY in their career with Bono having a blonde streak in his hair. Maybe it&#8217;s me, but Stevie Nicks sounded way off-key in her two numbers.No it&#8217;s not Woodstock or Live Aid or Monterey Pop but a few of these performances by lesser known bands are entertaining. And it&#8217;s not a $60. Box set.  It&#8217;s 135 minutes of rock footage &#8211; with some commentary to put it in perspective &#8211; and I certainly enjoyed watching it once.Don't wait - expecting a better version of this Festival. It took 30 years for this to come out so you either settle for this version or not. That's really the bottom line.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",4,2  hours of SOME of the &#8220;Woz&#8221;-funded festival.
