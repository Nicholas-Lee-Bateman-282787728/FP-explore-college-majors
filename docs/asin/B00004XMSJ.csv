556411,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004XMSJ,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 1]","This is a quaint and charming little comedy about life and love in rural northwestern Ireland.  The question remains, how many rural Irish comedies can we watch before the material starts to get stale.  The story begins with the single men of this little town complaining that the women are substandard and there are no marriage prospects.  After downing far too many pints, they decide to place an advertisement in the Miami Herald to see if they can induce some American women to come to Ireland to the big town dance.  When the townswomen get wind of the scheme, they invite some Spanish fishermen to the same dance.  The result is a succession of comical situations where everyone makes fools of themselves in anticipation of the big day.  The net result of all this is the lesson Dorothy learned when she left Kansas; that when you are looking for your heart's desire, you don't have to look any further than your own backyard.Aileen Ritchie's directorial debut was marked by some nice photography of well-selected locations and an alluring portrayal of the local color and appeal.  The characters all seemed very genuine and unaffected; the way country folks generally are regardless of national origin.  The scenes leading up to the dance work well, but the film bogs down after the dance as the tone changes from mirthful to dramatic.The acting was generally good with a couple of standouts.  Ian Hart stole the show as Kieran the headstrong town butcher.  He was simultaneously affable and obnoxious.  His character's complete obliviousness to how ridiculous he was gave Hart ample opportunity to become a laugh magnet.  Niahm Cusack was also enchanting as Kate, mixing mischievousness with romantic appeal to create a delightful character.I rated this film a 7/10.  It is very light fare, silly enough that it will get a chuckle or two out of almost everyone.",4,Enchanting Irish Comedy,970185600,"09 29, 2000",2000,1869,"['quaint', 'charming', 'little', 'comedy', 'life', 'love', 'rural', 'northwestern', 'Ireland', 'question', 'how', 'many', 'rural', 'Irish', 'comedies', 'can', 'watch', 'material', 'get', 'stale', 'story', 'single', 'men', 'little', 'town', 'complaining', 'women', 'are', 'substandard', 'are', 'marriage', 'prospects', 'downing', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'pints', 'decide', 'place', 'advertisement', 'Miami', 'Herald', 'see', 'can', 'induce', 'American', 'women', 'come', 'Ireland', 'big', 'town', 'dance', 'When', 'townswomen', 'get', 'scheme', 'invite', 'Spanish', 'fishermen', 'same', 'dance', 'result', 'succession', 'comical', 'situations', 'where', 'everyone', 'fools', 'anticipation', 'big', 'day', 'net', 'result', 'lesson', 'Dorothy', 'learned', 'when', 'left', 'Kansas', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'heart', 'desire', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'further', 'own', 'backyard.Aileen', 'Ritchie', 'directorial', 'debut', 'was', 'marked', 'nice', 'photography', 'well-selected', 'locations', 'alluring', 'portrayal', 'local', 'color', 'appeal', 'characters', 'seemed', 'very', 'genuine', 'unaffected', 'way', 'country', 'folks', 'generally', 'are', 'regardless', 'national', 'origin', 'scenes', 'leading', 'up', 'dance', 'work', 'well', 'film', 'bogs', 'down', 'dance', 'tone', 'changes', 'mirthful', 'dramatic.The', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'good', 'couple', 'standouts', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'stole', 'show', 'Kieran', 'headstrong', 'town', 'butcher', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'affable', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'complete', 'obliviousness', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'gave', 'Hart', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'become', 'laugh', 'magnet', 'Niahm', 'Cusack', 'was', 'also', 'enchanting', 'Kate', 'mixing', 'mischievousness', 'romantic', 'appeal', 'create', 'delightful', 'character.I', 'rated', 'film', '7/10', 'very', 'light', 'fare', 'silly', 'enough', 'will', 'get', 'chuckle', 'two', 'almost', 'everyone']",American Women VHS
