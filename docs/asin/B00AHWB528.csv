We've done two recent Africa trips, and were looking for a good 3D experience to relive some of the memories.  This disc does NOT come through, unfortunately.The 3D is not bad.  It's not great, but it's there.  I had to validate, though, that it was shot in 3D...it looks more like a conversion.Where this fails, utterly, though, is the narration.  It's as if the narrator was reading, w/o actually paying attention to what he was matching his narration to (i.e. talking about big cats while the screen is showing ostriches...this happens over and over and over and over).If they pulled this, redid the narration, and cleaned up some of the transitions, they might have something.  As is, even at $10, it's a waste.A FAR better 3D disc to watch to both capture phenom 3D and narration done correctly would be IMAX's Born to be Wild.",1,What a disappointment,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,899,"['wife', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'come', 'out', 'while', ""'ve"", 'done', 'two', 'recent', 'Africa', 'trips', 'were', 'looking', 'good', '3D', 'experience', 'relive', 'memories', 'disc', 'NOT', 'come', 'unfortunately.The', '3D', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'there', 'had', 'validate', 'though', 'was', 'shot', '3D', 'more', 'conversion.Where', 'utterly', 'narration', 'narrator', 'was', 'reading', 'w/o', 'actually', 'paying', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'matching', 'narration', 'i.e', 'talking', 'big', 'cats', 'screen', 'showing', 'ostriches', '.If', 'pulled', 'redid', 'narration', 'cleaned', 'up', 'transitions', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'even', '10', 'waste.A', 'FAR', 'better', '3D', 'disc', 'watch', 'capture', 'phenom', '3D', 'narration', 'done', 'correctly', 'would', 'be', 'IMAX', 'Born', 'be', 'Wild']",WILD AFRICA 3D - An Extraordinary Journey
1610684,A32FJR9BXP7AFI,B00AHWB528,C. Clines,"[2, 4]","First, I agree with those who say the 3D is not good. Only the underwater shots are truly 3D. Don't know the problem on land...some shots seem to be 3D, others not. But that's not the main complaint; it's just a boring documentary. One could see more excitement going to a zoo. The boring commentator tells us what the animals can do and how it's always a matter of survival for them, but we only see them walking or laying around. How many head shots of hippos in the water do you need to see? You can see better stuff on TV. In other words, save your money for something better, which can be just about anything.",1,Very boring,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,614,"['First', 'agree', 'who', 'say', '3D', 'not', 'good', 'Only', 'underwater', 'shots', 'are', 'truly', '3D', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'problem', 'land', 'shots', 'seem', 'be', '3D', 'others', 'not', 'not', 'main', 'complaint', 'just', 'boring', 'documentary', 'One', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'excitement', 'going', 'zoo', 'boring', 'commentator', 'what', 'animals', 'can', 'do', 'how', 'always', 'matter', 'survival', 'only', 'see', 'walking', 'laying', 'around', 'How', 'many', 'head', 'shots', 'hippos', 'water', 'do', 'need', 'see', 'can', 'see', 'better', 'stuff', 'TV', 'other', 'words', 'save', 'money', 'something', 'better', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'anything']",WILD AFRICA 3D - An Extraordinary Journey
