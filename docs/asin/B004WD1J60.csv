Unfortunately, as fast as they go, the zombies still show up late, not appearing until a half-hour into the film.  Once they arrive the fun begins, with blood splattering like lawn sprinklers...or a Gallagher concert.  It's all in good fun, a Texas-sized barbeque of devoured flesh.  The dialogue is funny, the irony thick, (unlike the blood).These zombies can shoot, and also outrun a Toyota, living up to the title.  They go for the neck, infecting their victims, something they have in common with vampires.  Several stories intercut which keeps the action moving, and most of the characters are entertaining.  The battle of the sexes, politics and other contemporary issues (gun control anyone?) complicate the main battle, and the movie delightfully doesn't miss the opportunity for some serious, satiric jabs.But mostly it's non-stop action for a full hour, with more weaponry than you'd find at Fort Riley, and more blood than the Red Cross sees in a month.

1430586,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004WD1J60,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","If, like me, you have such an insatiable craving for zombie mayhem and flesh eating carnage--you will no doubt be enchanted and drawn in by the colorfully titled ""Fast Zombies With Guns."" I mean really! Awesome title that evokes nothing but joy and wondrous expectation. Even knowing that this was an extremely low budget cheapie, this seemed like a can't miss explosion of bad movie fun. Sadly, the film's title is its most interesting aspect! The so-called zombies in this epic exhibit none of the qualities or characteristics that you've come to know and love. They are just badly made up extras, usually in pink shirts to simulate blood, who run up to people and bite their necks. That is, of course, unless they just shoot you. There is no rhyme or reason to the zombie mythology--it is just a murderous horde of bad amateur actors. This would even have been alright had the film been any fun. A couple of moments near the end elicit some genuine chuckles--but really, this just doesn't work.In a rural town in Missouri, a mob boss takes out a contract on a potential witness and his wife to prevent him from testifying about some sort of undefined nefarious act. He has his henchman put a dangerous chemical (his words, not mine) into their water supply which is what starts the epidemic of the undead. How they got the chemical? Who knows? Why it triggers the reaction? Why bother? What's a mob boss doing in a tiny town? Good question. Why does he live in apparent squalor (his house and car seem suspiciously inexpensive)? Never explained. Although he does have two million dollars to pay for another contract. Okay, I'm calling it--least believable mob activity ever recorded on film. The casting, in general, is bizarre and clearly the location extras are having fun helping their friends make this movie. My favorite moment is a television news segment with a completely miscast trio of news anchor, field reporter, and police representative. The studio set consists of a sheet that the reporter speaks in front of.Again, I'm fine with low budget. (In fact, Chemical Burn also released ""The Defiled""--which is a terrifically creative and artistic take on the zombie legend done with a couple of nickels). But it's got to be fun. I watched this with a friend who bailed at the thirty minute point--he'd reached his threshold. The zombies are never convincing. I watched a zombie movie and never once got the feeling I was watching zombies. As for guns, the entire town has them. No one ever reloads either, but maybe I am just being too picky--maybe the zombies have a cache of ammunition that they keep going back to. On the technical side, poor lighting and sound don't improve anything either. A couple of bright spots--a hood's girlfriend camps it up for some amusement and the finale escape has a couple of nice moments. But in general, it just doesn't work as a zombie picture or even as bad movie fun.
