1531276,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B007IJKQG4,,"[7, 13]","In ""Gone,"" Amanda Seyfried stars as Jill Parrish, a kidnapping survivor who was forcefully taken from her home and imprisoned in a deep hole in a heavily wooded area, where she found the remains of other victims.  She managed to escape, but a year later, her sister Molly (Emily Wickersham) goes missing and Jill is convinced that the same man had come back looking for her.  She goes to the police but her suspicions are tough to prove, since there was never any evidence found concerning her own kidnapping.Over the last year, Jill has been seeing a psychotherapist to help her overcome lingering fears. Still, she keeps files of local missing persons and dogs the police whenever she believes she has leads.  The police now think of her as a nuisance and a paranoid nut case.The plot of this film is shamelessly cribbed from any number of Hitchcock classics about a victim who cannot go to the authorities and must enter into dangerous situations alone to discover the identity of the bad guy(s).  The dramatic point in the Hitchcock pictures was placing an average Joe or Jill in extraordinary situations.  Director Heitor Dahlia does the same with her Jill, but makes her more avenging warrior than frightened girl.  She packs a .38, concocts on-the-spot lies to gather information, and has detective skills and instincts that would make Sherlock Holmes seem an amateur.  We never buy her as a real character, merely Hollywood's mannequin substitute for one.Ms. Seyfried is an actress (and I use the term lightly) with one expression -- wide-eyed, deer-in-the-headlights terror.  This ceases to be effective since, after a couple of scenes, she comes off more as a saucer-eyed cartoon than a woman determined to find her missing sister.  We should be rooting for her, but she becomes more and more irritating as the film progresses.This routine thriller lacks a key ingredient -- suspense.  The narrative is essentially a police procedural, minus the police.  We see Jill travel throughout Portland, Oregon, attempting to piece together clues that might lead her to Molly.  Assorted unsavory or suspicious characters are introduced, any one of whom might be the serial killer, but when the tension should increase and suspense should be at its peak, the movie coasts along into familiar, cliched territory.Another significant flaw is the identity of the serial killer.  In ""Silence of the Lambs,"" the film it aspires to, Buffalo Bill was a real character -- vile and horrifying, but a solid character nonetheless.  In ""Gone,"" we learn little about the killer, see him even less, and so aren't horrified by him at all.  Call him the generic serial killer.  Though it would be unsettling, it might be interesting to find out why this guy goes to such efforts to kidnap and imprison young women.""Gone"" has a couple of good supporting performances, by Jennifer Carpenter as a friend of Jill and Daniel Sunjata as a detective who investigated Jill's original claims of being abducted.  They are talented actors who deserve much better material.A thriller customarily builds to a climax -- a peak of dramatic action.  The ""big"" sequence in ""Gone"" is a terrible disappointment and makes the viewer wonder why he invested time and money to see the movie.  This undistinguished PG-13 rated picture is a collection of obvious red herrings, contrived situations, unlikely encounters, and overly zealous vigilantism.",2,Seen It All Before,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,3409,"['Gone', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Jill', 'Parrish', 'kidnapping', 'survivor', 'who', 'was', 'forcefully', 'taken', 'home', 'imprisoned', 'deep', 'hole', 'heavily', 'wooded', 'area', 'where', 'found', 'remains', 'other', 'victims', 'managed', 'escape', 'year', 'later', 'sister', 'Molly', 'Emily', 'Wickersham', 'missing', 'Jill', 'convinced', 'same', 'man', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'looking', 'police', 'suspicions', 'are', 'tough', 'prove', 'was', 'never', 'evidence', 'found', 'concerning', 'own', 'kidnapping.Over', 'last', 'year', 'Jill', 'been', 'seeing', 'psychotherapist', 'help', 'overcome', 'lingering', 'fears', 'Still', 'files', 'local', 'missing', 'persons', 'dogs', 'police', 'whenever', 'leads', 'police', 'now', 'think', 'nuisance', 'paranoid', 'nut', 'case.The', 'plot', 'film', 'shamelessly', 'cribbed', 'number', 'Hitchcock', 'classics', 'victim', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'authorities', 'must', 'enter', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'alone', 'discover', 'identity', 'bad', 'guy', 's', 'dramatic', 'point', 'Hitchcock', 'pictures', 'was', 'placing', 'average', 'Joe', 'Jill', 'extraordinary', 'situations', 'Director', 'Heitor', 'Dahlia', 'same', 'Jill', 'more', 'avenging', 'warrior', 'frightened', 'girl', '.38', 'on-the-spot', 'lies', 'gather', 'information', 'detective', 'skills', 'instincts', 'would', 'make', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'seem', 'amateur', 'never', 'buy', 'real', 'character', 'merely', 'Hollywood', 'mannequin', 'substitute', 'one.Ms', 'Seyfried', 'actress', 'use', 'term', 'lightly', 'one', 'expression', 'wide-eyed', 'deer-in-the-headlights', 'terror', 'be', 'effective', 'couple', 'scenes', 'off', 'more', 'saucer-eyed', 'cartoon', 'woman', 'determined', 'find', 'missing', 'sister', 'should', 'be', 'rooting', 'more', 'more', 'irritating', 'film', 'progresses.This', 'routine', 'thriller', 'key', 'ingredient', 'suspense', 'narrative', 'essentially', 'police', 'procedural', 'police', 'see', 'Jill', 'travel', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'attempting', 'piece', 'together', 'clues', 'might', 'lead', 'Molly', 'Assorted', 'unsavory', 'suspicious', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'one', 'whom', 'might', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'when', 'tension', 'should', 'increase', 'suspense', 'should', 'be', 'peak', 'movie', 'along', 'familiar', 'cliched', 'territory.Another', 'significant', 'flaw', 'identity', 'serial', 'killer', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'film', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'was', 'real', 'character', 'vile', 'horrifying', 'solid', 'character', 'nonetheless', 'Gone', 'learn', 'little', 'killer', 'see', 'even', 'less', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'horrified', 'Call', 'generic', 'serial', 'killer', 'would', 'be', 'unsettling', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'guy', 'such', 'efforts', 'kidnap', 'imprison', 'young', 'women', 'Gone', 'couple', 'good', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'friend', 'Jill', 'Daniel', 'Sunjata', 'detective', 'who', 'investigated', 'Jill', 'original', 'claims', 'being', 'abducted', 'are', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'deserve', 'much', 'better', 'material.A', 'thriller', 'customarily', 'climax', 'peak', 'dramatic', 'action', 'big', 'sequence', 'Gone', 'terrible', 'disappointment', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'why', 'invested', 'time', 'money', 'see', 'movie', 'undistinguished', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'picture', 'collection', 'obvious', 'red', 'herrings', 'contrived', 'situations', 'unlikely', 'encounters', 'overly', 'zealous', 'vigilantism']",Gone

And it's bad enough when you've got a serial killer chasing you, but it's really bad when you have embarrassed and under qualified cops chasing you as well.  Now, how're you going to outsmart them both?Well, easy.  All you've got to do is have a dumb serial killer and some dumb cops.  And we've got some of both going on here; after all, we're in Portland.  But you also need a smart chick, at least a street smart one.  And we've got one of those as well.And that smart chick would be Amanda Seyfried, who really showed off her assets in ""Chloe"" -- a film that didn't necessarily give her career a boost, something that can't be said for the male audience of that thriller, however -- gives a kick-tail-and-take-names performance here as a gal who has to fight off a serial killer.  Twice.  You'd think that her killer wannabe would have thunk twice about taking her on twice.  But remember, he wasn't all that sharp.  Or perhaps he just wanted to see her again.  Can't say I blame him.It's interesting that they filmed this in Portland.  After all, there haven't been that many serial killers from there, have there?  Let's see. . . .  1.  I-5 Killer, aka Randall Woodfield.  2.  Happy Face Killer, aka Keith Hunter Jesperson.  3.  Green River Killer, aka Gary Ridgway (to be fair, I think that he just dumped one body in that area to confuse the police.)  Looks like there have been quite a few more than that, peeking around the web.  So I guess that Portland is as good a place as any to set this film.  And it's rainy to boot, so the people there must be depressed.And the setup involves Ms. Seyfried being at least depressed, perhaps even crazy.  But we know better.  And I wouldn't say that you'd be crazy to not put this on your Wish List, but I will recommend it is kind of fun.  Fun, if you like revenge flicks, I suppose.

You see, Jill has a very good reason to be afraid. A year ago she was found wandering aimlessly through the woods claiming to have been abducted from her bed and taken to a hole by an unknown man. According to her, she wasn't the first person to meet up with this guy. Too bad the police couldn't find the so called hole or any remains to any previous victim and, after a year of Jill running around crying wolf in her obsession in finding this serial killer, they are less inclined to believe in anything she has to say. And who can blame them?  After awhile, we do see that Jill can really cook up a story as she goes on a one-woman search to try and find Molly before time runs out.  Does this guy really exist and has he really come back to exact his revenge for her escaping by taking Molly in her place? Or is this just another one of Jill's wild goose chases that will only wind up costing the tax payers' hard earned money and the police department's time and worn thin patience?  No one believes her; not the cops, not her best friend, not even Molly's fianc&eacute;. But, armed with her wits and a loaded .44, Jill's determined to save her sister and proved once and for all that what she knows to be the truth.For what it is, Gone is not a bad movie. It just wasn't handled very well. It's a thriller and there are tons of plot holes big enough to drive a Greyhound bus through but that is usually pretty typical for this kind of movie. At least Jill isn't jumping a bus over a 200' hole in the road and still having it land and be perfectly drivable with no damage to its suspension system or frame.  The acting was good to ok with the only real sour note being in another victim to a poor agent Wes Bently. My only gripe is that the whole Mystery Man is never really developed fully so there is no menace to him at all.  And the whole ending does come off as anticlimactic. But, in the end, it isn't the worst way to waste an hour and a half. Just try and not over think it and nit pick at all the minor inconsistencies.  It is what it is. B+.

1531304,A328S9RN3U5M68,B007IJKQG4,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Why some movies make it in the box office and others don't is a conundrum. GONE is a beautifully conceived and acted and directed suspense thriller that has many levels of meaning. Much of the success of the film is due to the brilliant writing of Allison Burnett, one of our finest writers of novels (I've read them all) - the brilliant  `Christopher', `The House Beautiful', `Death by Sunshine',  and `Undiscovered Gyrl' - and screenplays for `Fame', `Untraceable', `Feast of Love', 'Resurrecting the Champ' and others. His name deserves to be in the top credits for this stunning little thriller. It appears that one of his novels, `Undiscovered Gyrl' is in production as a film. He is a major talent.During the opening credits we meet Jill Conway (Amanda Seyfried) walking through a dense forest, map in hand, searching for something. Jill is a young Portland woman who lives with her sister, recovering alcoholic Molly (Emily Wickersham). The year before, Jill was kidnapped by a serial killer who abandoned her in a hole in the forest, where she found human remains. When her abductor descended into the hole to kill her, Jill was able to stab him with a bone and climb his rope and return to civilization. However, the police didn't find the hole and discovered that Jill had been committed to a psychiatric institution for several years after her parents' death. Believing that the abduction only happened in Jill's head, they closed the case. Yet one day, after returning home from work at a local diner, where she and her friend Sharon Ames(Jennifer Carpenter) are generously tipped by a regular customer about to move out of town, Jill finds Molly gone and is unable to reach her boyfriend, Billy (Sebastian Stan). Knowing that Molly wouldn't leave the house with Jill absent and that she had an important test the following day, Jill becomes convinced that the man who took her has now captured Molly and heads to the police station to ask for help, but Sargent Powers (Daniel Sunjata) and Detective Erica Lonsdale (Katherine Moennig) dismiss her claims and promise to look into the case after a few days: Jill claims it will be too late by then. Before she leaves, newcomer Detective Peter Hood (Wes Bentley) pulls her aside and tells her he believes her, giving Jill his card in case she needs help.Jill is convinced that the man who abducted her has also abducted Molly, believing he was finally getting Jill to kill her. Despite the lack of support and help from the police who insist she is insane, Jill sets out on a thorough investigation and life threatening chase (both from the police who feels she is dangerous when they discover Jill is carrying a gun) and from people she meets along the way. How the story ends is brilliant writing, but to reveal more would ruin the suspense. Director Heitor Dhalia paces his excellent cast well and there are many conflicting clues in addition to Jill's uncanny ability to create false scenarios to gain information. This is a first class film on every level, especially making the point that the police too often view victims as hysterical and dismiss their interest in unsolved cases. Highly Recommended.

A year ago she was kidnaped out of her own bed and taken to the woods to be put into a deep hole and left.  Things get worse when she discovers the remains of other women buried in the bottom of the hole.  When the kidnapper returns to kill her; she escapes and tells the police about her kidnapping.  They cannot prove that she was taken and believe that she made up the entire story.  Jill has a history of being in a mental institution and as a result her credibility is gone.A year later and returning home after work, she finds her sister is missing from bed and she knew that she was supposed to be there.  She goes to the police who simply blow her off as a crackpot who is still wasting their time.  Jill realizes that she has less than a day to find and save her sister or she will become the next victim of the serial killer....My wife and I just watched this DVD and we enjoyed it.  We found if to be a dramatic and suspenseful movie that is well written and acted out. It is a story of a young woman who cannot get the immediate support she needs from the police and as a result she is forced to do her own detective work and find the serial killer in order to save her sister. She has a short deadline to find her sister and the police would rather arrest her than believe that her sister is missing.  The story line is good and Amanda did a reasonable job portraying the protagonist in the story.Sure the storyline has flaws, but every movie has them.

Since then Amanda has done a mixture of good and bad films (with Red Riding Hood falling into the later category), but she's always done well in most films despite the lean material provided.In ""Gone"" she plays Jill, a girl with a history mental problems living in Oregon looking for clues to the whereabouts of her younger sister who she believes was kidnapped by a killer. There's not much more to the story than that, though there are some flashbacks she keeps having to being pinned down and subdued in her bed by the killer. Once she comes back to her house from her night job and finds the sister gone she goes searching for her sister and the same killer she says attacked her.There's the expected cliches like most of the police not believing her when she says this guy is back, the red herring suspects like the sister's boyfriend (Sebastian Stan ""Captain America""), a new cop to the force (Wes Bentley ""American Beauty"" & ""The Hunger Games"") or perhaps even Jill herself (insert not so shocking gasp here). Also the pure insanity that goes along with Jill's desperate searching for her sister before its too late.The main problem with ""Gone"" is the lack of punch and scares provided throughout the movie, it plays out like a really bad TV cop drama. Its quite predictable but at least the acting while basic is good thanks mainly to Seyfried and Bentley. The ending is also a bit of a joke as a lot of loose ends got tied up in a fairly silly manner. * out of 4 stars.",1,"""Gone"" should've just stayed away.........",1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,1752,"['Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'been', 'actress', 'rise', 'years', 'going', 'back', '2004', 'Mean', 'Girls', '2008', 'film', 'musical', 'rendition', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'one', 'breakthrough', 'rolls', 'was', '2009', 'Jennifer', 'Body', 'horror/comedy', 'mix', 'where', 'easily', 'outshined', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'then', 'Amanda', 'done', 'mixture', 'good', 'bad', 'films', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'falling', 'later', 'category', 'always', 'done', 'well', 'most', 'films', 'lean', 'material', 'provided.In', 'Gone', 'Jill', 'girl', 'history', 'mental', 'problems', 'living', 'Oregon', 'looking', 'clues', 'whereabouts', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'killer', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'having', 'being', 'pinned', 'down', 'subdued', 'bed', 'killer', 'back', 'house', 'night', 'job', 'sister', 'gone', 'searching', 'sister', 'same', 'killer', 'attacked', 'expected', 'cliches', 'most', 'police', 'not', 'believing', 'when', 'guy', 'back', 'red', 'herring', 'suspects', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'Sebastian', 'Stan', 'Captain', 'America', 'new', 'cop', 'force', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'perhaps', 'even', 'Jill', 'insert', 'not', 'so', 'shocking', 'gasp', 'here', 'Also', 'pure', 'insanity', 'along', 'Jill', 'desperate', 'searching', 'sister', 'too', 'late.The', 'main', 'problem', 'Gone', 'lack', 'punch', 'scares', 'provided', 'movie', 'out', 'really', 'bad', 'TV', 'cop', 'drama', 'quite', 'predictable', 'least', 'acting', 'basic', 'good', 'thanks', 'mainly', 'Seyfried', 'Bentley', 'ending', 'also', 'bit', 'joke', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'got', 'tied', 'up', 'fairly', 'silly', 'manner', '*', '4', 'stars']",Gone
1531314,A2M8O1WZRXMRQ9,B007IJKQG4,Jose Jones,"[1, 1]","""Gone"" is one of those classic flicks that you had no idea existed but rent because you see a few familiar names in the cast.  It was actually Wes Bentley's name that caught my eye, though he has an awkward and brief appearance here.  The film is held completely on the shoulders of Amanda Seyfried and I think she nails it.  She commands your attention here -- frazzled, distraught, and then cold-bloodedly bold and almost dangerously zealous to find her sister.  I remember Seyfried from back in her ""Veronica Mars"" days and I was impressed with her.  A lot of credit has to go to director Heitor Dhalia.  This movie DRIPS with atmosphere.  The man knows how to make the little hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  Every scene has a creepy, voyeuristic, something-bad-is-going-to-happen-at-any-moment feel.The movie boils down to Seyfried's desperate attempt to find her sister, and the actress makes it all worth watching, even when it's preposterous.  I won't give it away, but there's a really cool thing that happens in the end, where the film quiets down and the frenzy stops.  There's something so scary and odd about the scenes, but I only wish they would have lasted longer.  They are soon dashed for a much more conventional -- and quite frankly disappointing -- finale.My biggest issue with the film is some of the basic weirdness when dealing with the police.  The cops seem solely focused on Amanda's character but ignore the obvious: her sister is clearly missing and a mountain of evidence points to something sinister having happened to her.But it's actually a pretty good little popcorn flick thanks to its lead actress and its director, who elevate the material above its script.",3,Frustrating but well-acted thriller.,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,1703,"['Gone', 'one', 'classic', 'flicks', 'had', 'idea', 'existed', 'rent', 'see', 'few', 'familiar', 'names', 'cast', 'was', 'actually', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'name', 'caught', 'eye', 'awkward', 'brief', 'appearance', 'here', 'film', 'held', 'completely', 'shoulders', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'think', 'attention', 'here', 'frazzled', 'distraught', 'then', 'cold-bloodedly', 'bold', 'almost', 'dangerously', 'zealous', 'find', 'sister', 'remember', 'Seyfried', 'back', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'days', 'was', 'impressed', 'lot', 'credit', 'go', 'director', 'Heitor', 'Dhalia', 'movie', 'DRIPS', 'atmosphere', 'man', 'how', 'make', 'little', 'hairs', 'back', 'neck', 'stand', 'up', 'Every', 'scene', 'creepy', 'voyeuristic', 'something-bad-is-going-to-happen-at-any-moment', 'feel.The', 'movie', 'down', 'Seyfried', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'find', 'sister', 'actress', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'when', 'preposterous', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'really', 'cool', 'thing', 'end', 'where', 'film', 'quiets', 'down', 'frenzy', 'something', 'so', 'scary', 'odd', 'scenes', 'only', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'lasted', 'longer', 'are', 'soon', 'dashed', 'much', 'more', 'conventional', 'quite', 'frankly', 'disappointing', 'finale.My', 'biggest', 'issue', 'film', 'basic', 'weirdness', 'when', 'dealing', 'police', 'cops', 'seem', 'solely', 'focused', 'Amanda', 'character', 'ignore', 'obvious', 'sister', 'clearly', 'missing', 'mountain', 'evidence', 'points', 'something', 'sinister', 'having', 'happened', 'her.But', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'thanks', 'lead', 'actress', 'director', 'who', 'elevate', 'material', 'script']",Gone

I think she is very talented and if she picks her works more carefully than she has so far, she will eventually take her place next to the great talented women of our time. That's where the HOWEVER comes in. So far, I have not been impressed by the movies she chooses. Mama Mia? Really? She can't sing, and she had one of the biggest singing parts. She should have passed on that one. Don't get me started about Dear John. I would have to say the only other work she has chosen that is even close to her calibre of talent is Letters to Juliette.I did not expect to like Gone as much as I did. Although I gave it a four, I'd say it's more like a 3 and a half. I really liked the story. The excitement begins almost as soon as the movie opens. She plays a waitress named Jill, who has a history with the police that isn't good. She had evidently been abducted some time ago and escaped. When she went to the police, they could find no evidence that anything bad had happened to her. On top of that, she was an emotional mess, so bad, she has to be put into a psychiatric hospital and has been on medication ever since. Because of her experience, she understandably does not trust the police. When she comes home from her night shift at the diner she works at and discovers her sister is not in bed as she should be, she immediately does the right thing, heading for the police station to let them know and try to get a file started and to start looking for her. To say more would probably spoil it for the rest of you, so let me just say that the police (for some reason that I could not quite understand) not only do not believe her sister was abducted, but they do everything they can to thwart Jill's efforts to try to find her sister. This part made little sense to me, whether or not Jill is a raving lunatic, if she comes in saying her sister has been abducted, it seems to me it is the duty of those who serve and protect us to at least make a limited pass at it. But that's not what happens, sending Jill off to find clues about her sister's disappearance on her own.I really did enjoy this movie, despite having to suspend a few major issues. The story isn't new - it's been done quite a few times and honestly, there wasn't much new in this one. However, Amanda Seyfried, IMHO, did one of the best jobs I've seen from her in her career. The suspense continued to grow, the story, despite the unbelievable reaction of the police, was riveting. The one other problem with this movie was that it was too short. Seriously, it was way too short a one hour and 35 minutes. On the bright side, it was over before I knew it.Despite the fact that this story has been done a bit too often, that the police were uninterested to the point of it being unbelievable, and that occasionally, the story was a bit choppy, I have to say that I really liked it. It's not in my top 10 favorite movies by any means. But for just simple, popcorn eating, soda drinking pleasure, it was within my realm of likability. These days where movies aren't considered worthy if they don't have some deep, edgy meaning, or some political pokes at common folks, or some family epiphanies happening, etc., it was nice to just sit back and watch a simple, old fashioned ""who-done-it."" Having a decent strong cast involved was a plus, even if they weren't used as much as they should have been.

A few years later Jill's sister goes missing and she is convinced it is the same man who took her years before. Jill will stop at nothing to save her sister from a gruesome fate and catch the serial killer behind multiple kidnappings.I really enjoyed this film and although it was technically in the thriller/horror genre I didn't find it all that frightening. I thought the cinematography and soundtrack was good in the sense that it enhanced the suspense of the movie.

Plus she really handles the situation that she is in with a level head and she never gives up even though everyone around her doubts her and tells her she is crazy.

1531341,A246YIFE5M6M2C,B007IJKQG4,"Shawn Kovacich ""Shawn Kovacich""","[13, 14]","Well I just returned from the midnight showing of this new suspense-thriller starring Amanda Seyfried ofJennifer's Bodyfame and Jennifer Carpenter who is perhaps better known as Debra Morgan of the outstanding hit Showtime series,Dexter. Also included in the cast is Michael Pare, whom you might recall from some of his earlier films such as;Eddie and the Cruisers / Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!andStreets of Fire.Now I am not going to give away in spoilers in this review, but I will give you a brief synopsis of the movie which is as follows...Jill, played by Seyfried, plays a young woman who is an emotional wreck after being abducted by a serial murderer the year before and narrowly escaping with her life. However, the police were never able to find any evidence of an actual abduction and they come to the conclusion that Jill had a mental breakdown and made up the entire incident due to the untimely death of both of her parents a few months prior to her alleged abduction. This results in her involuntary commitment to a mental hospital where everyone tries to convince her that nothing ever really happened and that she is merely making everything up in her own mind. Unable to get anyone to believe her, Jill sets out to try and find the place where she was being held and the man that put her there.A year later, her own sister Molly disappears and Jill is convinced that she was abducted by the same serial murderer that had kidnapped her a year earlier. Molly goes to the police for help but because she has a history of mental illness nobody believes her. Frustrated and running out of time, Jill starts investigating Molly's disappearance in an attempt to find her sister and save her life. This takes her on a very suspenseful journey and she tracks down clues to her sister's disappearance all the while the police are more concerned with arresting her instead of trying to find her missing sister. During her search for her sister, Jill has periodic flashbacks to her experiences being abducted the year before and you don't find out the entire story of her abduction until shortly before the end of the movie. Normally I find this to be a bit irritating, but for some unexplained reason, it really didn't bother me this time. I guess in this particular instance, I have to attribute that to good film-making.On a personal note, I really liked the very last line in the movie uttered by Jill right before she walks back into her house. Totally classic and very poignant!I found this to be a very suspenseful and engaging thriller and it had me on the edge of my seat a couple of times anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. One thing I liked in particular was the fact that the character of Jill seemed to be a lot more proactive in defense of herself as seen by several very intelligent things she does throughout the movie, but once I started thinking that this character was going to step out of the typical damsel-in-distress mode, she would do something rather boneheaded and make me cringe. Although I will readily admit that she was a much stronger female character than the vast majority of them being played today, but obviously there is still some work to go in that department.My only real complaint with this movie is something that I just can't really put my finger on, but for some reason I felt that this movie was lacking something, although I am not quite sure exactly what that something is. Perhaps I was let down a bit with the ending as I will readily admit that it could have been done a bit better than what it was, but perhaps that is just me. In any case, I highly recommend this movie as my girlfriend and I both really enjoyed it.Shawn KovacichMovie LoverAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.",4,"Very Engaging and Suspenseful Thriller, But Something Seemed To Be Missing",1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3772,"['Well', 'just', 'returned', 'midnight', 'showing', 'new', 'suspense-thriller', 'starring', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'ofJennifer', 'Bodyfame', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'who', 'perhaps', 'better', 'known', 'Debra', 'Morgan', 'outstanding', 'hit', 'Showtime', 'series', 'Dexter', 'Also', 'included', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'whom', 'might', 'recall', 'earlier', 'films', 'such', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', '/', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', 'II', 'Eddie', 'andStreets', 'Fire.Now', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'review', 'will', 'give', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'Jill', 'played', 'Seyfried', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'being', 'abducted', 'serial', 'murderer', 'year', 'narrowly', 'escaping', 'life', 'However', 'police', 'were', 'never', 'able', 'find', 'evidence', 'actual', 'abduction', 'come', 'conclusion', 'Jill', 'had', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'made', 'up', 'entire', 'incident', 'due', 'untimely', 'death', 'parents', 'few', 'months', 'prior', 'alleged', 'abduction', 'results', 'involuntary', 'commitment', 'mental', 'hospital', 'where', 'everyone', 'convince', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'happened', 'merely', 'making', 'everything', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'Unable', 'get', 'anyone', 'believe', 'Jill', 'out', 'try', 'find', 'place', 'where', 'was', 'being', 'held', 'man', 'put', 'there.A', 'year', 'later', 'own', 'sister', 'Molly', 'Jill', 'convinced', 'was', 'abducted', 'same', 'serial', 'murderer', 'had', 'kidnapped', 'year', 'earlier', 'Molly', 'police', 'help', 'history', 'mental', 'illness', 'nobody', 'Frustrated', 'running', 'time', 'Jill', 'investigating', 'Molly', 'disappearance', 'attempt', 'find', 'sister', 'save', 'life', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'journey', 'down', 'clues', 'sister', 'disappearance', 'police', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'arresting', 'instead', 'trying', 'find', 'missing', 'sister', 'search', 'sister', 'Jill', 'periodic', 'flashbacks', 'experiences', 'being', 'abducted', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'entire', 'story', 'abduction', 'shortly', 'end', 'movie', 'Normally', 'find', 'be', 'bit', 'irritating', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'time', 'guess', 'particular', 'instance', 'have', 'attribute', 'good', 'film-making.On', 'personal', 'note', 'really', 'liked', 'very', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'uttered', 'Jill', 'right', 'back', 'house', 'Totally', 'classic', 'very', 'poignant', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'engaging', 'thriller', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'couple', 'times', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'One', 'thing', 'liked', 'particular', 'was', 'fact', 'character', 'Jill', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'proactive', 'defense', 'herself', 'seen', 'several', 'very', 'intelligent', 'things', 'movie', 'once', 'started', 'thinking', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'step', 'out', 'typical', 'damsel-in-distress', 'mode', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'rather', 'boneheaded', 'make', 'cringe', 'will', 'readily', 'admit', 'was', 'much', 'stronger', 'female', 'character', 'vast', 'majority', 'being', 'played', 'today', 'obviously', 'still', 'work', 'go', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'movie', 'something', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'put', 'finger', 'reason', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'lacking', 'something', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'something', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'bit', 'ending', 'will', 'readily', 'admit', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'perhaps', 'just', 'case', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'girlfriend', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.Shawn', 'KovacichMovie', 'LoverAuthor', 'Creator', 'numerous', 'books', 'DVD']",Gone

Because there was no evidence from her last abduction...if fact it was contrary to her story, the police show reluctance to help Amanda, telling her to come back Monday if her sister is still missing. She also has a history of ""Crying Wolf."" Amanda is convinced it is the same guy who abducted her, and her sister is going to be killed tonight if she doesn't find her and the killer. Officer McKay seems willing to help, but his interest in Amanda comes across as less than professional and is suspect to anyone who watches these films. Molly's boyfriend (Sebastian Stan) has his doubts too and appears less than concerned as suspects mount. To add to that list of suspects there is the creepy neighbor as well as the creepy locksmiths.Armed with information from the creepy neighbor and a .38 Amanda won't sleep until the abductor is found.The ending was fine, but it needed a final Hitchcock twist.

When they don't believe her she decides to track him down herself. This is another movie I had high expectations for based on the preview.

The movie is tense in parts and frustrating in others and keeps you guessing all the way to the end. There was just something missing in this to make it really good.

Her struggle to find out the truth is made doubly difficult because no one around her believes what she says. This is an intriguing, Hitchcock-like premise, and Brazilian director Heitor Dhalia manages to keep the ball rolling until the final act where the story, so far pretty good, suddenly fizzles.Amanda Seyfried plays Jill Parrish, a Portland girl who was abducted and imprisoned in a hole somewhere in Forest Park. She escapes, but the terrible event still haunts her. Well, that's what she says. The local police, however, do not believe that. They could not locate the hole in the forest. Besides that, Jill was once in a psychiatric institution.It is only natural that the police officer Sgt. Powers (Daniel Sunjata) is skeptical when Jill claims her college student sister Molly (Emily Wickersham) is kidnapped. She is not at home. She has missed the test. The police think she will eventually come back. Jill does not think so and starts her own investigation alone.Despite the countless plot holes, pointless car chase and some incredible incompetence on the part of the police, ""Gone"" remains entertaining, except the last chapter where our heroine is finally given a chance to do what she wants to do, she does it in the blandest and most forgettable way imaginable.

(Even though technically it's illegal for her to own a gun since she spent time in a mental institution, but hey, if you had been abducted and were scared for your life, I'm sure you'd get a gun too!).The main thing about this movie that I didn't like, was something that I also really liked about the movie.  It's that the main character, this girl who is in her early 20's who is a waitress, did more police work to find this killer than the actual police did.  Seriously, she gets out, asks people if they saw anything, gets a description of the vehicle that was seen at the scene of the crime, googles it, finds where the van came from and does an actual investigation.
