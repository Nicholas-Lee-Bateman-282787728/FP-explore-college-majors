Each episode flowed with more natural comedic comebacks, surprise twists, and fine-tuned performances by the multitalented singing and dancing super mom Alice (Linda Lavin), the gum cracking Texas tornado flirt Flo (Polly Holiday), the naive and dingy Vera (Beth Howland), and the gruff and barking, but softhearted Mel (Vic Tayback). The four were by now like a closely knit family, especially with Alice's perspicacious son Tommy (Phillip McKeon), as the binding force. The episodes are hilarious and provide wholesome entertainment for everyone.",5,Alice Season 3 Sweeps The Stage !,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,654,"['third', 'season', 'Alice', 'actors', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cohesive', 'totally', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'episode', 'flowed', 'more', 'natural', 'comedic', 'comebacks', 'surprise', 'twists', 'fine-tuned', 'performances', 'multitalented', 'singing', 'dancing', 'super', 'mom', 'Alice', 'Linda', 'Lavin', 'gum', 'cracking', 'Texas', 'tornado', 'flirt', 'Flo', 'Polly', 'Holiday', 'naive', 'dingy', 'Vera', 'Beth', 'Howland', 'gruff', 'barking', 'softhearted', 'Mel', 'Vic', 'Tayback', 'four', 'were', 'now', 'closely', 'knit', 'family', 'especially', 'Alice', 'perspicacious', 'son', 'Tommy', 'Phillip', 'McKeon', 'binding', 'force', 'episodes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'provide', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'everyone']",Alice: The Complete Third Season
1640519,AZFI8SNOTJBJY,B00BWQU0RY,Eve the Muse,"[2, 3]","I love this show.  It's always good for some laughs.  You can't go wrong buying this DVD set.  ""Alice"" is a great show because it doesn't just give you a lot of laughs, but it deals with serious subjects at times like Vera's trying to kill herself and Alice dealing with being a widow with a small child to raise on her own.  Thank goodness that a lot of the good TV shows are now available on DVD because I'm not too crazy about the new sitcoms on TV.  I look at DVD's much more than I look at TV.  Sure, no comedy could ever compare with ""I Love Lucy"", but sometimes I like to look at something funny in color and ""Alice"" fits the bill just right every time.",4,"You Always Get the Laughs from ""Alice""",1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,660,"['love', 'show', 'always', 'good', 'laughs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'Alice', 'great', 'show', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'lot', 'laughs', 'serious', 'subjects', 'times', 'Vera', 'trying', 'kill', 'Alice', 'dealing', 'being', 'widow', 'small', 'child', 'raise', 'own', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'lot', 'good', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'crazy', 'new', 'sitcoms', 'TV', 'look', 'DVD', 'much', 'more', 'look', 'TV', 'Sure', 'comedy', 'could', 'ever', 'compare', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'sometimes', 'like', 'look', 'something', 'funny', 'color', 'Alice', 'bill', 'just', 'right', 'time']",Alice: The Complete Third Season

The characters all just seemed to play well together. The comedy is original, and ages well for the most part. Obviously, the show was done more than 30 years ago, but for those of us who lived during that time, it's almost like going home again. Even with those moments, I think most people will enjoy the comedy that deals with the problems of every day life faced by working people.",5,Awesome show!,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,508,"['watched', 'show', 'Sunday', 'evening', 'church', 'family', 'was', 'Alice', 'Jefferson', 'Sunday', 'night', 'characters', 'just', 'seemed', 'play', 'well', 'together', 'comedy', 'original', 'ages', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'Obviously', 'show', 'was', 'done', 'more', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'lived', 'time', 'almost', 'going', 'home', 'again', 'Even', 'moments', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'deals', 'problems', 'day', 'life', 'faced', 'working', 'people']",Alice: The Complete Third Season

1640523,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B00BWQU0RY,Kasey G,"[2, 2]","The third season of ALICE consists of 24 episodes that aired Sunday nights on CBS during the 1978-79 TV season. Halfway through the season ALICE was moved to the prestigious 9:00 Sunday time slot and became the CBS anchor for the night, a position it would hold until the fall of 1982.TV veteran William Asher (""I Love Lucy"", ""Bewitched"") directs most of these installments and it's here that that show starts cooking on all four burners. Some of the earlier episodes had a static feel to them--not so with this bunch. There's a terrific two-parter where Mel sells the diner to a snooty restaurateur (Hans Conried) and the series walks the fine line between comedy and pathos in the terrific season-finale ""Flo Finds Her Father"" (played by F-TROOP's Forrest Tucker). That episode as well as the one that precedes it on this set (""My Fair Vera"") boasts exceptional video quality. In fact, I noticed an improvement on most of these episodes over those on Warner Archive's Season 1 and 2 sets.The writing just seems sharper at this point in the series, and surprisingly, even though the episodes themselves are self-contained, there is a continuity that was unheard of on sitcoms at this time. ""Alice's Decision"", ""If The Shoe Fits"" and ""My Fair Vera"" all make mention of Alice auditioning for the same talent scout and Vera appearing in a children's theatre production of Cinderella.If you have been on the fence about springing for any of these M-O-D ALICE sets so far, make this the one to get--you won't be disappointed.FIVE STARS and bring on Season 4 and FLO: THE COMPLETE SERIES.",5,ALICE Is Cooking On All Four Burners,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,1583,"['third', 'season', 'ALICE', 'consists', '24', 'episodes', 'aired', 'Sunday', 'nights', 'CBS', '1978-79', 'TV', 'season', 'Halfway', 'season', 'ALICE', 'was', 'moved', 'prestigious', '9:00', 'Sunday', 'time', 'slot', 'became', 'CBS', 'anchor', 'night', 'position', 'would', 'hold', 'fall', '1982.TV', 'veteran', 'William', 'Asher', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Bewitched', 'most', 'installments', 'here', 'show', 'cooking', 'four', 'burners', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'had', 'static', 'feel', 'not', 'so', 'bunch', 'terrific', 'two-parter', 'where', 'Mel', 'diner', 'snooty', 'restaurateur', 'Hans', 'Conried', 'series', 'fine', 'line', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'terrific', 'season-finale', 'Flo', 'Finds', 'Father', 'played', 'F-TROOP', 'Forrest', 'Tucker', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'set', 'Fair', 'Vera', 'exceptional', 'video', 'quality', 'fact', 'noticed', 'improvement', 'most', 'episodes', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Season', '1', '2', 'sets.The', 'writing', 'just', 'sharper', 'point', 'series', 'surprisingly', 'even', 'episodes', 'are', 'self-contained', 'continuity', 'was', 'unheard', 'sitcoms', 'time', 'Alice', 'Decision', 'Shoe', 'Fits', 'Fair', 'Vera', 'make', 'mention', 'Alice', 'auditioning', 'same', 'talent', 'scout', 'Vera', 'appearing', 'children', 'theatre', 'production', 'Cinderella.If', 'have', 'been', 'fence', 'springing', 'M-O-D', 'ALICE', 'sets', 'so', 'far', 'make', 'one', 'get', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.FIVE', 'STARS', 'bring', 'Season', '4', 'FLO', 'COMPLETE', 'SERIES']",Alice: The Complete Third Season

1640526,AU198IEOK853S,B00BWQU0RY,MediaFan,"[11, 12]","Ordered this set through WB before it appeared on Amazon, and I'm very happy that Amazon is offering it for sale now as this iconic TV show's 3rd season was one of its most entertaining.Watching these episodes over 30 years after they originally aired lets you appreciate the things you maybe didn't appreciate in the past. For example, the appearances by Corey Feldman (pre-Goonies) and Nancy McKeon (Jo from The Facts of Life and a myriad of Lifetime movies). Episode highlights include Mel selling the diner, Alice dating Tommy's principal, Vera playing Cinderella, and Flo having her beau-less New Year's Eve.There are 24 episodes on three discs and, although they are manufactured on demand, they are very good quality. This is definitely the best that I've ever viewed these episodes, and believe me it's worth the purchase price to see them all in their entirety. For the cost of about two movie tickets you get a whole season of Alice, Mel (Stow it!), Flo (Kiss my grits), and Vera at their best. By the end of it you'll be clamoring for the release of Season 4.Also of note, as of the writing of this review, Alice Doesn't Live Her Anymore (the movie on which the tv series was based) is available on amazon again, I received my copy a few days ago.
