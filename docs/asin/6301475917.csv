The thing I liked the best about it was that even though I was in my 30s, had never done yoga before, and had never been very flexible, I could do ALL of the postures. Of course, my form wasn't always perfect and I did have to modify at times, but at least I was able to approximate the basic poses, which I found very gratifying. Instructor Patricia Walden does use props, but I found that I could make do without or by using substitutions (e.g., a thick book instead of a yoga block).One caution about this video is that it definitely moves slowly, as Patricia takes quite a bit of time for instruction in-between each posture. Because of this, it's probably best viewed as an instructional video rather than a complete yoga practice. I also found Patricia's instruction style to be rather dry (although I didn't find her condescending as some others have mentioned). Once I became more familiar with the postures, I usually fast-forward past Patricia's instruction, and eventually, as I progressed further, I got rid of this video altogether. Although there are many more options for those new to yoga available today, I still think this is a solid foundation that can serve as a good place to begin your yoga journey.",4,Worked well for me when I was just starting out,1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,1384,"['2001', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'yoga', 'options', 'market', 'are', 'today', 'wanted', 'try', 'yoga', 'video', 'seemed', 'liked', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'thing', 'liked', 'best', 'was', 'even', 'was', '30s', 'had', 'never', 'done', 'yoga', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'very', 'flexible', 'could', 'do', 'postures', 'course', 'form', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'perfect', 'did', 'have', 'modify', 'times', 'least', 'was', 'able', 'approximate', 'basic', 'poses', 'found', 'very', 'gratifying', 'Instructor', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'use', 'props', 'found', 'could', 'make', 'do', 'using', 'substitutions', 'e.g.', 'thick', 'book', 'instead', 'yoga', 'block', '.One', 'caution', 'video', 'definitely', 'slowly', 'Patricia', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'instruction', 'in-between', 'posture', 'probably', 'best', 'viewed', 'instructional', 'video', 'rather', 'complete', 'yoga', 'practice', 'also', 'found', 'Patricia', 'instruction', 'style', 'be', 'rather', 'dry', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'condescending', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Once', 'became', 'more', 'familiar', 'postures', 'usually', 'fast-forward', 'past', 'Patricia', 'instruction', 'eventually', 'progressed', 'further', 'got', 'rid', 'video', 'altogether', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'options', 'new', 'yoga', 'available', 'today', 'still', 'think', 'solid', 'foundation', 'can', 'serve', 'good', 'place', 'begin', 'yoga', 'journey']",Yoga Journal's Yoga for Beginners with Patricia Walden VHS
253913,A17TDSX354MP7Y,6301475917,CPTScott,"[32, 32]","I have had several of Patricia Walden(as well as Rodney Yee's) videos for several years. The &quot;Yoga For Beginners&quot; video is an excellent place not only to start, but also to use for review. I often watch it when I'm doing preparatory warmups before my yoga routine to help me review and reinforcethe details of specific poses before heading into my yoga routine.This is very helpful because in many of the other videos in the Yoga Journal series, the pace is much faster and you don't have the level of detail in the instruction given in &quot;Yoga for Beginners&quot;.Once you have the basics down its much easier to follow videos such as &quot;Yoga for Strength&quot; and &quot;Yoga Remedies...&quot;  which move at a much faster pace and incorporate vinyasa(which is a series of poses in succession). Still, even when you've worked with those tapes for a while, it's nice to be able to go back to the Yoga for beginners tape from time to time for that extra, more detailed and slower instruction.One more thing that I particularly like is that Patricia Walden does the poses in a &quot;mirror image&quot; to you so you can move directly with her instead of having to &quot;transpose&quot; the poses (asanas) to the opposite side. That eliminates a lot of confusion and makes it easier to relax into the practice instead of trying to reverse everything in your mind.I have turned many people on to this video tape as a way to get started in Yoga and recommend it highly!",5,Yoga for beginners is a perfect place to start,992044800,"06 9, 2001",2001,1481,"['have', 'had', 'several', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'as', 'well', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'videos', 'several', 'years', 'quot', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'quot', 'video', 'excellent', 'place', 'not', 'only', 'start', 'also', 'use', 'review', 'often', 'watch', 'when', ""'m"", 'doing', 'preparatory', 'warmups', 'yoga', 'routine', 'help', 'review', 'reinforcethe', 'details', 'specific', 'poses', 'heading', 'yoga', 'routine.This', 'very', 'helpful', 'many', 'other', 'videos', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'series', 'pace', 'much', 'faster', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'level', 'detail', 'instruction', 'given', 'quot', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'quot', '.Once', 'have', 'basics', 'down', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'videos', 'such', 'quot', 'Yoga', 'Strength', 'quot', 'quot', 'Yoga', 'Remedies', 'quot', 'move', 'much', 'faster', 'pace', 'incorporate', 'vinyasa', 'series', 'poses', 'succession', 'Still', 'even', 'when', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'tapes', 'while', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'Yoga', 'beginners', 'tape', 'time', 'time', 'extra', 'more', 'detailed', 'slower', 'instruction.One', 'more', 'thing', 'particularly', 'like', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'poses', 'quot', 'image', 'quot', 'can', 'move', 'directly', 'instead', 'having', 'quot', 'quot', 'poses', 'asanas', 'opposite', 'side', 'lot', 'confusion', 'easier', 'relax', 'practice', 'instead', 'trying', 'reverse', 'everything', 'mind.I', 'have', 'turned', 'many', 'people', 'video', 'tape', 'way', 'get', 'started', 'Yoga', 'recommend', 'highly']",Yoga Journal's Yoga for Beginners with Patricia Walden VHS
253914,AZOGE2ZDSWXV9,6301475917,"jedbird ""jedbird""","[14, 14]","This program is, as the title implies, for BEGINNERS.  If you are used to doing aerobics, you may become impatient with the methodical pace, or unnerved by Patricia Walden's freakishly serene demeanor.  Following the short &quot;show-off&quot; intro (where Ms. Walden does a standing backbend that I immediately set as a long-term goal for myself), the actual instructional portion of the program is easy to understand and follow.  There is a lot of explanation and demonstration, including modifications of the poses and the use of props to help those who are less flexible.Reviewers who have found it boring or &quot;too easy&quot; are perhaps approaching this the wrong way.  You set your own pace, and there are no poses that a practitioner is ever &quot;done&quot; with.  As a klutzy, non-athletic person, I was thrilled the first time I did this program and was able to get through it without feeling flustered or uncoordinated.  I did this tape and nothing else for a year before I felt like I needed to &quot;move on.&quot;  While I'll always prefer taking a live class, I highly recommend the Yoga Journal series, and especially this tape.",5,excellent starting point,1021248000,"05 13, 2002",2002,1148,"['program', 'title', 'implies', 'BEGINNERS', 'are', 'used', 'doing', 'aerobics', 'may', 'become', 'impatient', 'methodical', 'pace', 'unnerved', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'freakishly', 'serene', 'demeanor', 'Following', 'short', 'quot', 'show-off', 'quot', 'intro', 'where', 'Ms.', 'Walden', 'standing', 'backbend', 'immediately', 'set', 'long-term', 'goal', 'actual', 'instructional', 'portion', 'program', 'easy', 'understand', 'follow', 'lot', 'explanation', 'demonstration', 'including', 'modifications', 'poses', 'use', 'props', 'help', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'flexible.Reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'boring', 'quot', 'too', 'easy', 'quot', 'are', 'perhaps', 'approaching', 'wrong', 'way', 'set', 'own', 'pace', 'are', 'poses', 'practitioner', 'ever', 'quot', 'done', 'quot', 'klutzy', 'non-athletic', 'person', 'was', 'thrilled', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'program', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'feeling', 'flustered', 'uncoordinated', 'did', 'tape', 'nothing', 'else', 'year', 'felt', 'needed', 'quot', 'on.', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'always', 'prefer', 'taking', 'live', 'class', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'series', 'especially', 'tape']",Yoga Journal's Yoga for Beginners with Patricia Walden VHS

However, after I saw and practice the video, I felt great.  I felt very relaxed and I was even able to sleep much better.  I feel that the video has helped me pay attention to my body and my person as well.

The pause between poses is ridiculously long, and I really despise the ""jump"" she uses to go into lunges.  It feels completely disjointed and takes away the soothing aspect of yoga.  Also, for beginners especially, it would be nice if there was a little more flow.  It's usually easier to go into side angle (side stretch or whatever she calls it) and THEN into triangle instead of just standing and going directly into triangle.  Then there's the names . . . what she calls ""cobbler's pose"" is actually bound angle.
