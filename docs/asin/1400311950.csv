167684,A3Q4MAOOFZ5W1O,1400311950,Agent 92,"[92, 117]","I cannot recommend this movie due to its blasphemous depiction of Jesus at the Last Supper.Watch the Last Supper scene again and pay careful attention to how they depict Jesus ordering Judas to go and do what he HAS to do.  He does this several times to a seemingly reluctant Judas.Jesus to Judas: ""Judas, go and do what you have to do"".Judas' reply, ""Master?""Jesus to Judas: ""While you have the chance.""Judas looks down at the table.Jesus to Judas: ""Go on, go and do it.""Judas still looking down at the table.Jesus to Judas: ""Go and do it quickly""Judas appears overpowered and stammers trying to get out of it ""Master, I . . "" and then slowly and sadly leaves (apparently obeying) as if he has just been ordered to do something he would rather not do and betray his God.Why has nobody else had a problem with this scene.This is a terrible reinterpretation of the Gospel of John's 'Satan entered into him &lt;Judas>.  Jesus said to him, ""What you are going to do, do quickly.""'It is what Judas had already decided and resolved to do indicated by Satan entering him, not what he HAD to do or what Jesus repeatedly ordered him to do as if he had no choice in his actions.In the Miracle Maker movie, it is like Jesus is doing the tempting in place of Satan and ordering Judas to sin when it appears Judas would rather not do this or has not yet made up his mind and is only being obedient.God does not want men to sin and perish.  Luke's and John's gospels indicate Satan entering into Judas when the decision has already made.  That is before Jesus indicates to Judas that his cover is blown and that he should leave in John's Gospel.The Last Supper is a crucial scene and the Miracle Maker film makers have twisted this badly.  This portrayal would be disturbing in any movie, much less one that would indoctrinate kids with their first impressions of Jesus.  I cannot recommend this movie which otherwise had promise.I am  throwing my Miracle Maker DVD out with the next load of trash.",1,Miracle Maker turns Jesus into the tempter,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,1985,"['can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'due', 'blasphemous', 'depiction', 'Jesus', 'Last', 'Supper.Watch', 'Last', 'Supper', 'scene', 'again', 'pay', 'careful', 'attention', 'how', 'depict', 'Jesus', 'ordering', 'Judas', 'go', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'several', 'times', 'seemingly', 'reluctant', 'Judas.Jesus', 'Judas', 'Judas', 'go', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', '.Judas', 'reply', 'Master', 'Jesus', 'Judas', 'have', 'chance', 'Judas', 'down', 'table.Jesus', 'Judas', 'Go', 'go', 'do', 'Judas', 'still', 'looking', 'down', 'table.Jesus', 'Judas', 'Go', 'do', 'quickly', 'Judas', 'overpowered', 'stammers', 'trying', 'get', 'Master', 'then', 'slowly', 'sadly', 'leaves', 'apparently', 'obeying', 'just', 'been', 'ordered', 'do', 'something', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'do', 'betray', 'God.Why', 'nobody', 'else', 'had', 'problem', 'scene.This', 'terrible', 'reinterpretation', 'Gospel', 'John', ""'Satan"", 'entered', 'lt', 'Judas', '>', 'Jesus', 'said', 'What', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'do', 'quickly', 'what', 'Judas', 'had', 'already', 'decided', 'resolved', 'do', 'indicated', 'Satan', 'entering', 'not', 'what', 'HAD', 'do', 'what', 'Jesus', 'repeatedly', 'ordered', 'do', 'had', 'choice', 'actions.In', 'Miracle', 'Maker', 'movie', 'Jesus', 'doing', 'tempting', 'place', 'Satan', 'ordering', 'Judas', 'sin', 'when', 'Judas', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'yet', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'only', 'being', 'obedient.God', 'not', 'want', 'men', 'sin', 'perish', 'Luke', 'John', 'gospels', 'indicate', 'Satan', 'entering', 'Judas', 'when', 'decision', 'already', 'made', 'Jesus', 'Judas', 'cover', 'blown', 'should', 'leave', 'John', 'Gospel.The', 'Last', 'Supper', 'crucial', 'scene', 'Miracle', 'Maker', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'twisted', 'badly', 'portrayal', 'would', 'be', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'would', 'indoctrinate', 'kids', 'first', 'impressions', 'Jesus', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'had', 'promise.I', 'am', 'throwing', 'Miracle', 'Maker', 'DVD', 'next', 'load', 'trash']",N/A

167686,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,1400311950,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[13, 14]","""The Miracle Maker"" is a moving and inspiring telling of the life of Jesus, with meticulous use of animation techniques. It is a mix of 2 styles that though very different, work beautifully together, blending well from scene to scene. Some of it is drawn, in bold colors and simple, strong lines, by animators in Wales, and this is contrasted by the glorious work done in Russia, using clay puppets. These puppets are astounding, with detailed features, graceful, delicate hands, and eyes that seem real. The animals and settings are also a marvel, and one can understand how this film took 5 years to make.The story manages to include many of events in the life of Jesus, as well as some of the parables, told with reverence and always faithful to its biblical source. It gives a major role to Jairus' daughter, who Jesus brought back to life (Mark 5: 21, Luke 8:41), and is here named Tamar. Making Tamar a central focus of the story works well, and we see much of it through the yes of this child, whose dance of joy is a memorable moment in the film. Rebecca Callard plays Tamar, and is part of a stellar cast, which includes Ralph Fiennes (Jesus), Miranda Richardson (Mary Magdalene), Julie Christie (Tamar's mother), Richard Grant (John the Baptist), Ian Holm (Pontius Pilate), and William Hurt (Jairus).The DVD includes a fascinating ""Making of"" documentary, and a Spanish version, which is spoken in the purest of Castillian Spanish, and will be appreciated by those who understand the language. Directed by Derek Hayes and Stanislav Sokolov, with a lovely score by Anne Dudley, this film is remarkable, and has a spirit that keeps it fresh after many viewings. It will also amaze anyone who is an animation aficionado, with its innovative, technical brilliance.

I caught it at the time Jesus was getting baptized by John and wow, I was impressed.  This isnt like all the other claymation stories. There is a high level of technology put in to make the claymation Jesus...real. It is like a cross between an animated cartoon Jesus and the real life human being Jesus. It is a big trip.

I got this from a friend of mine; although new in my walk with Christ, I had to wait until I could receive the message of this movie. When a movie like this is right for you, you'll know too. Honestly, I can say let the Holy Spirit guide to when its right. By 'when its right', I mean you will crave the message of who Jesus is, and in your heart will will thirst to know the living God.For an Animated movie Miracle Maker has a solid base, like food for your soul watching the Son of God gain his followers will ignite your faith and inspire you. Watching much of this movie reminds me of how often people omit Jesus from their lives, then beg for his help during times of desperation and fear. Luckily for these people their countless numbers are not judged for this and are still able to receive the gift of their salvation through their faith.Back to the film, Miracle Maker also has great music and wonderful stop motion animation and ""painterly"" 2D animation. Miracle Maker will also teach you how the ruling class in their deception want to steal the faith of the people, and take away their hope by destroying Jesus. This still happens today, look  at our schools and culture. Can jesus get mad? Yes, when he sees what the ruling class has done to the temple he does. This also presents one of the best lines in the movie, a variation of the famous quite:  ""Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's""Miracle Maker is so rich in proper and accurate retelling of the gospel, I would suggest this movie to ANYONE wanting an understanding of Jesus. Who he was and what he did and WHO he died for, namely us.""Not by MY will, but YOUR will be done!""Jesus cries out as this fantastic beautiful tale takes the turn that heavies your heart. Although I know and understand what Jesus did for us, I still ask why he had to be taken? Watching the last part of Miracle make is heart breaking. Jesus' quiet confidence could teach us all HUGE lesson about humility.The few minutes of sadness are rolled away and this part of the movie is wonderfully and gently portrayed.

The characters in this wonderful film are foam and plastic stop motion puppets. There is a vast difference in the somewhat crude and clumsy claymation characters and these refined and detailed figures.One of the reasons this film works so wonderfully is that since they are puppets, the viewer is able to accept them as the characters much easier than having Christ done by a human actor. The viewer doesn't have the persona of the actor constantly in the back of his or her mind. Also these figures are really true to the actual racial types than actors in make up and wigs can be. The stop motion animation is wonderfully fluid and realistic.This is a &quot;Family&quot; film, but that should not put off an adult viewer. The 2 and 3 D animation makes this a wonderfully moving telling of the age old story of Christ. Using 2D animation for the parables and flash backs is a stroke of genius in keeping them in a different perspective than the &quot;actual&quot; story.This is a brilliantly done recreation of one of the greatest stories ever told (in fact it is much better than the over blown film using that phrase as a title - no Hollywood &quot;names&quot; to distract from the story in this version).

Watching it for the first time on television last year, I was very moved, and I feel it is the best film about Jesus that has ever been done.  The use of 3-D and 2-D animation was very creative.  The 2-D animation was used for flashbacks or when Jesus was telling stories (such as the parables) which gave a realness to the 3-D characters.  Also, the 3-D characters were less distracting than live actors which put more emphasis on the story and its message.Based on the book of Luke, it is Biblically accurate.  The only error I could see, and very minor, was when during the Parable of the Good Samaritan and one of the people who walked was said to be Sadducee.  I suppose the writer thought that would more interesting.  Of course one always wishes they could have every scene, but realistically the film producers could not include everything and were restricted to 90 min. I do wish they had been able to include Jesus calming the storm, but I am happy at what the writer COULD include like the Road to Emmaus (not included in any other film I've ever seen).  I understand that the writer is a Christian, which shows, by the emphasis on the Resurrection and mention of the Holy Spirit(at Christ's baptism and Accension).  The writer did use parts from the other Gospels as well to complement Luke.The story is masterfully done and I like how the characters are developed, especially Mary Magdalene and Tamar (they gave her a name), the Leader of the Synogogue's 12 year old daughter who was raised from the dead.  It was neat how they followed the story from a child's eye view and the character of Tamar was a thread that helped bring the story together.  Another theme that was throughout the story which I really liked, was the idea of Jesus being the Doorway into Life.The DVD has some neat features including a documentary about how the film was made.  They show the little dolls, models, that were made by Russian animators.  I think many of us would like to have the Jesus one!  I also liked how the menu has Christian symbols on it, and the cursor that you use to select special features is in the shape of a cross.  Very creative.I think this film has had a very significant spiritual impact on many people and it was definitely inspired!  The soundtrack is also fantastic (very moving) and really adds to the movie.

Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[15, 16]","This was one of the best depictions I have ever seen of the life of Jesus, and amazingly, it was done all in 3d animation, using molded puppets, and in hand drawn animation.  I never would have thought that the story could have been told so well using this format, but this movie was truly well told.Unlike a lot of the other stories told about Jesus, this one was mainly told through the eyes of Tamar, the daughter of Jairus.  Tamar was the little girl who had died, but Jesus had said that she was only sleeping, and that he would awaken her.  That was the extent that we had heard about her in the bible, but this story tells a lot of what happens from her perspective, and though unusual, it did a very good job.Also, one of the things rarely seen in other movies on Jesus, we got to see more of his human side in this movie.  Jesus was after all, both a man, and God, so it was nice to see him portrayed that way, to see him laughing, taking joy in life, and not above taking time to enjoy life.It was interesting to see how flashbacks, some miracles, and the parables that Jesus told were done using animation, to give a different style to the movie.  They were also done in a somewhat humorous style, and were easy to understand, so that we could see how the parables reflect our own lives.  The story never got too preachy, and instead, just showed us the way that God wants us to live our lifes without hammering away at the point.Ralph Fiennes did a good job as the voice of Jesus, as did everyone else, adding to the overall production value of the movie.  His inflections, especially as he told the parables, was right on, lending value to the stories themselves.  You could feel that he was speaking right to the people, showing them the right path, and trying to help them follow it.  I was simply amazed, particularly since the movie only runs for about an hour and a half.  Some things are skipped over in this production, some of the other parables Jesus taught such as the man with two sons, and there's no mention of the feeding of the multitudes either, but with the time constraints, certain things had to be cut out.  What we are left with though is more than adequate, and leaves you with a warm feeling long after the movie has ended.

Burton ""Bookworm""","[0, 0]","This film was recommendded to me by a friend, and I was pleasantly surprised by the accuracy and accessibility of the movie.  Adhering mostly to Luke's account, the film depicts several crucial scenes from Christ's ministry, clearly portraying His divinity but also emphasizing His humanity.  Whereas most movies focus on one aspect of Christ's life, (either His divinity is not mentioned at all, or He is portrayed with little human characteristics), The Miracle Maker beautifully shows a compassionate, honest, pain-wracked yet fun-loving man.  I loved how the movie was shown through the eyes of a child.  We see events unfold from the perspective of a little girl, (called Tamar in this movie), who is the daughter of Jairus, the girl whom Jesus healed, (Mark 5).  One of my favorite aspects of the film is seeing Jesus regale the crowds with parables.  His humor and love of storytelling shine in these scenes, and as the stories unfold, we see Tamar and other children react as they visualize the parables in their minds.The voice acting in this movie is wonderful.  Ralph Fiennes, (whom I've only seen in villain roles), does a masterful job of portraying Christ.  His voice throbbs with both good-natured humor and heartwrenching pain.  Julie Christie is phenomenal as Mary Magdalene, portraying her torment, redemption and utter joy upon encountering the risen Savior.  The actor portraying Simon Peter is excellent as well.  I love that he had an Irish accent.  This touch really emphasized Peter's lower-class status.  This is another aspect where the movie excells: viewers fully understand Jesus' refusal to distinguish between race or class systems.  We see Him reach out to everyone.  We also experience the joy of those who accept His help and the jealousy and insecurity of those who do not.Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Although it should not, under any circumstances, take the place of Scripture itself, the film is a wonderful way to whet individual's appetites to find out more about God's only Son.

167733,A31ACI0E88ORDE,1400311950,The Great White Father,"[0, 0]","Given that this is a Jesus film in stop-motion animation, it would be easy to jump to conclusions, to judge this as being a sappy, kid-friendly, poorly done attempt by pious Christians who don't know how to make a good movie.You would be SO wrong to think that!In the first place, despite a large cast of characters, they manage to make every single one of them have presence, a distinctive look, and a distinctive personality, without forgetting any of them!  That is NOT easy to do, and I applaud them, as they made this feel real!  Also, on those occasions where they do need to explain things that audiences might not know, there is an excuse given here so that it doesn't feel like the fourth wall being broken--like it's being explained to a child, or to someone new in the neighborhood who wouldn't be expected to know already.I also like how Jesus is introduced so anonymously at the beginning, yet He ties together all the threads by the end--isn't that just how a Jesus film ought to be?I could go on and on, but I primarily want to save this review for my favorite aspect of it: Ralph Fiennes as Jesus.  When I first heard this, I was skeptical at best: I was only familiar with his portrayals of villains (the least evil character I'd seen him do was the first: Rameses in The Prince of Egypt).  Could such an actor possibly do justice to Jesus Christ?Not only does he do Him justice, but this is one of the best portrayals of Jesus I've ever seen!  Talk about a talented and versatile actor!Of course, since none of us will ever know firsthand what it is like to be fully God and fully Man at the same time, not even the most devout and knowledgeable Catholic Christian, there is room for interpretation--but we can at least know what would be inconsistent with the revealed Truth about Jesus Christ, and avoid that.  A convincing portrayal of Jesus Christ needs at least three things--if not overtly, then at least nothing incompatible with such:1) Jesus must be convincing as the eternally begotten Son of God, through Whom all things were made.  He must know us better than we know ourselves, and love us more than anyone else does or could.  He must speak on His own Authority with absolutely no self-consciousness--so that it neither sounds like bragging nor like a mortal actor so humble as to be embarrassed even pretending to be the Son of God, but rather like Someone Who knows firsthand what the Kingdom of Heaven is like and what must be done to get there.  Likewise, He must perform His miracles effortlessly, not as if He were struggling to manage it, like a sorcerer.  Ralph Fiennes manages this very well--never did I get a hint of self-consciousness, as if it were anyone but the true Son of God talking.  Better still, when He tells us to love our neighbor, as the Good Samaritan did, I find I want to do so not because of guilt or fear, but because I want to please Him--that's just the right reaction!2) Jesus must be convincing as a Man, like us in all ways except sin.  While this is not perfect throughout (I fear the writers may have misunderstood ""What you do, do quickly"" because, while this is low-key enough that I presume this wasn't their intent, it looks like Jesus is leading Judas into sin here), we see a lot of this as well.  This Jesus smiles to be anywhere, doing anything, with anyone; He laughs a hearty laugh of pure joy, rather than at anything funny (the kind of laugh Santa Claus should have but never does); He cries over the death of John the Baptist; He is honestly tempted by the Devil's temptations, even though He neither gives in to sin nor to wayward passions in the end; He is seriously frightened at the prospect of His death; He gets angry in righteous anger, as in the cleansing of the Temple; He gets exasperated and frustrated.  And He always feels the right feeling for the occasion, and in the right amount, and expressing it in the right way.3) Jesus must be convincing as One Person.  He must not be a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" type, switching between ""now I'm the Son of God"" and ""now I'm Jesus of Nazareth""--He is all the same Person, the same performance, whether He is telling what the Kingdom of Heaven is like, or whether He is holding a conversation at mealtime.  I saw always the same Person throughout this entire film--never once did the performance feel out of character.Even if you only watch the film for Jesus alone, it is well worth your money--and why not make it a double feature?  Why not watch The Prince of Egypt first, and then this?  (Especially since the significance of the Passover isn't made quite as clear as it might be.)God bless you all!P. S.  Also, I think this portrayal of Judas Iscariot is probably as good as any in terms of his exact motivation in betraying Jesus.  The performance isn't always the best everywhere, especially as they make it look as though he were having second thoughts during the Last Supper, but for the most part it is well done.",5,The closest

I enjoyed the creativity of the writing; for example, when Jesus tells Mary, ""I can still mend doors... but I'm building something new, now."" The animators bring first-century Palestine to life with great vibrancy, and the diversity of accents in the cast (American, English, Scottish) really helps to give the setting a cosmopolitan feel.The only lowlights for me were the traditional animation/cartoon sequences, which didn't quite work, and were of inferior quality to the clay-animation.
