I am not a fan of drama films, but I do like drama films that blend in with the supernatural, or things that are just out of this world. In this case K-Pax is that type of film. I didn't actually want to see this, I've seen the commercials but I didn't know what the film was about. I started watching it and the story really got me into the film, and got me thinking about the way we all live. The movie gives you a real kick, and makes you realise you have to live your life, because we don't have much time. The story in this film is incredible, and there are actually two stories at once, and this film is also a mystery till the very end. The end is actually a twist, but it was a great ending, to an amazing film. Even after watching it you still think about it, you ask alot of what if questions to yourself. It makes you wonder what's out there, and for a movie to have that big of an effect on someone would make it something real special. Whether you're into these type of films or not you should give this movie a chance. It definately made me respect people more than I already do, and it shows you that you should really respect other peoples beliefs and give them a chance as well. It will make you laugh and think but even more so it will make you realise there is alot more to life than what we think. It's a great movie but it's also a sad movie. It's very dramatic, and I don't think this would be a film for younger audiences, children could not comprehend the meaning of this film and what is going on in it. The acting is incredible, I was never that big of a Kevin Spacey fan but he blowed me away with his performance. It's also a change for him too, most of the films I have seen him in, he has played a villain, or an evil person. But this one is totally different, I don't care who you are, or what you're into, this is one of the best films I have ever seen and I regret not watching it any sooner. A must buy, so don't wait any longer, and watch this film.",5,This movie is AMAZING!!!!!!,1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,2086,"['am', 'alot', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'would', 'fit', 'category', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'drama', 'films', 'do', 'drama', 'films', 'blend', 'supernatural', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'world', 'case', 'K-Pax', 'type', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'want', 'see', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'commercials', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'started', 'watching', 'story', 'really', 'got', 'film', 'got', 'thinking', 'way', 'live', 'movie', 'real', 'kick', 'realise', 'have', 'live', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'story', 'film', 'incredible', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'stories', 'once', 'film', 'also', 'mystery', 'very', 'end', 'end', 'actually', 'twist', 'was', 'great', 'ending', 'amazing', 'film', 'Even', 'watching', 'still', 'think', 'ask', 'alot', 'what', 'questions', 'wonder', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'movie', 'have', 'big', 'effect', 'someone', 'would', 'make', 'something', 'real', 'special', ""'re"", 'type', 'films', 'not', 'should', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'definately', 'made', 'respect', 'people', 'more', 'already', 'do', 'should', 'really', 'respect', 'other', 'peoples', 'beliefs', 'give', 'chance', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'will', 'make', 'realise', 'alot', 'more', 'life', 'what', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'also', 'sad', 'movie', 'very', 'dramatic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'younger', 'audiences', 'children', 'could', 'not', 'comprehend', 'meaning', 'film', 'what', 'going', 'acting', 'incredible', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'fan', 'blowed', 'away', 'performance', 'also', 'change', 'too', 'most', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'played', 'villain', 'evil', 'person', 'one', 'totally', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'are', 'what', ""'re"", 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'regret', 'not', 'watching', 'sooner', 'must', 'buy', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'longer', 'watch', 'film']",N/A
586647,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKIR,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I agree with those who consider this a sorely underrated film.  When one approaches a film such as `K-PAX' it is easy to disregard it as nonsensical fluff.  I remember when my parents suggested the film.  I was very, very hesitant.  They even let me borrow their personal copy they just had to buy after watching the film.  They thought it was that good.  Still, I was hesitant.  I had other things to watch that must have been better than this.It's funny, because I absolutely love both Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey.After watching `K-PAX' I have a completely different outlook.  The film somewhat drops the ball in the end for many, but then again I have this aching feeling that it was intentional.  The ambiguous ending can be frustrating, especially in a world that demands answers.  Thankfully, I've grown to accept and even relish in the `mystery' presented in cinema, and so over time the ending to `K-PAX' has become less irritating and more engrossing to me.  I have contemplated and drawn my own conclusions that I hope are correct, yet I'm still silently aching to know for sure just WHAT happened.Was he?Wasn't he?The film revolves around a Dr. named Mark Powell whose new psychiatric patient Prot believes that he is from the planet K-PAX and that he has traveled here using light rays in order to study our planet for a report he will submit when he gets home.  He has a date of his departure.  July 27th.  He is incredibly knowledgeable of solar systems and stars and planets and he is so confident in his identity that he comes across entirely convincing.But he's crazy; right?I really wish I knew the answer to that question, but then again some of the beauty in `K-PAX', and films like it, is that constant mystifying resolution.  We will ponder the questions raised for quite some time, far longer than if the film had given us an out in the end.The acting here is sensational.  Both Bridges and Spacey nail their respective characters.  I am drawn to say that, as an actor, Bridges is the better man; but in this film Spacey really shines and totally steals the film.  Sure, he has the baitier character, but it is what he does with the character that really stays with you.  Spacey knows how to evoke sympathy, and he is one of the only actors I can define as an `infectious crier'.  Like Claire Danes, when Kevin Spacey cries, I cry.  I still get chills just thinking about the scene where he first goes under hypnosis.  It is so emotionally fluid and beautifully constructed.  He effortlessly shifts in and out of his characters, brilliantly concocting a character we are drawn into.So, I want to go out on a limb here and say that `K-PAX' may be one of those under-seen gems, a film that many shrug off as unworthy of their time but will be proved mistaken when they finally give it a chance.  It sure is one of the most surprising and essentially rewarding cinematic experiences for me personally.Highly recommended!",5,The mystery never fades...,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2942,"['agree', 'who', 'consider', 'sorely', 'underrated', 'film', 'When', 'one', 'film', 'such', 'K-PAX', 'easy', 'disregard', 'nonsensical', 'fluff', 'remember', 'when', 'parents', 'suggested', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'hesitant', 'even', 'let', 'borrow', 'personal', 'copy', 'just', 'had', 'buy', 'watching', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'Still', 'was', 'hesitant', 'had', 'other', 'things', 'watch', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'this.It', 'funny', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Kevin', 'Spacey.After', 'watching', 'K-PAX', 'have', 'completely', 'different', 'outlook', 'film', 'somewhat', 'ball', 'end', 'many', 'then', 'again', 'have', 'aching', 'feeling', 'was', 'intentional', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'especially', 'world', 'answers', 'Thankfully', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'accept', 'even', 'relish', 'mystery', 'presented', 'cinema', 'so', 'time', 'ending', 'K-PAX', 'become', 'less', 'irritating', 'more', 'engrossing', 'have', 'contemplated', 'drawn', 'own', 'conclusions', 'hope', 'are', 'correct', 'yet', ""'m"", 'still', 'silently', 'aching', 'know', 'sure', 'just', 'WHAT', 'happened.Was', 'Was', ""n't"", 'film', 'around', 'Dr.', 'named', 'Mark', 'Powell', 'new', 'psychiatric', 'patient', 'Prot', 'planet', 'K-PAX', 'traveled', 'here', 'using', 'light', 'rays', 'order', 'study', 'planet', 'report', 'will', 'submit', 'when', 'home', 'date', 'departure', 'July', '27th', 'incredibly', 'knowledgeable', 'solar', 'systems', 'stars', 'planets', 'so', 'confident', 'identity', 'entirely', 'convincing.But', 'crazy', 'right', 'really', 'wish', 'knew', 'answer', 'question', 'then', 'again', 'beauty', 'K-PAX', 'films', 'constant', 'mystifying', 'resolution', 'will', 'ponder', 'questions', 'raised', 'quite', 'time', 'far', 'longer', 'film', 'had', 'given', 'out', 'end.The', 'acting', 'here', 'sensational', 'Bridges', 'Spacey', 'nail', 'respective', 'characters', 'am', 'drawn', 'say', 'that', 'actor', 'Bridges', 'better', 'man', 'film', 'Spacey', 'really', 'shines', 'totally', 'film', 'Sure', 'baitier', 'character', 'what', 'character', 'really', 'Spacey', 'how', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'one', 'only', 'actors', 'can', 'define', 'infectious', 'crier', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'cries', 'cry', 'still', 'get', 'chills', 'just', 'thinking', 'scene', 'where', 'first', 'hypnosis', 'so', 'emotionally', 'fluid', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'effortlessly', 'characters', 'brilliantly', 'concocting', 'character', 'are', 'drawn', 'into.So', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'here', 'say', 'K-PAX', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'under-seen', 'gems', 'film', 'many', 'shrug', 'off', 'unworthy', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'proved', 'mistaken', 'when', 'finally', 'give', 'chance', 'sure', 'one', 'most', 'surprising', 'essentially', 'rewarding', 'cinematic', 'experiences', 'personally.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

586650,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JKIR,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[4, 5]","Although it opened to mixed reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by the very positive and entertaining way in which the movie ""K-PAX"" caught my imagination and subsequently ran away with it. Kevin Spacey, despite his last name, appears to be the most unlikely alien this side of ""Star Wars', and his depiction of a simple, forthright and bemused visitor (or is he?) caught up in an acute psychiatric care unit involuntarily steals the screen from the other erstwhile ensemble cast members of the film. Jeff Bridges plays the part of the befuddled and over-anxious psychiatrist well, although I do wish that just once such a film would depict a human protagonist who actually has his or her feet planted firmly on terra firma, who is in touch with his or her surroundings, and who is consciously aware of the natural environment as well as the other people populating his or her corner of the universe. Why is it always seen as a celestial characteristic to out-humanize the human beings, so that only the alien seems  empathetic, sensitive, and `human'?This is a thought-provoking film on a number of levels, and one is left wondering at the end of the final scenes as to what actually transpired here. There are a number of ways to interpret these final scenes, and, to make things even more tentative and interesting, there's even an alternative ending supplied in the CD version I viewed, which really makes for fascinating table talk. There are a few hilarious scenes in the movie, especially one in which Spacey interacts meaningfully with a dog to the amazement of the picnic crowd, that will leave the viewer with a sense that whoever made this film was bright, articulate, and thoughtful. The film has a number of surprising turns, and by the end I was quite interested and concerned with what would possibly happen to each of the assembled characters. In other words, the film works dramatically, and leaves one feeling glad to have experienced it. I heartily recommend the movie, and hope you find it as satisfying as I did.

For once Hollywood's script doctors having their wicked way with Brewer's original work didn't hurt the overall premise. Kevin Spacey is excellent as usual; though this time around he more than lives up to his name with his performance as Prot (pronounced Prote) a mysterious man who is admitted to a mental institution claiming to be an ET from the planet K-PAX. It is the task of psychologist Jeff Bridges to hear his babblings until he can get to the point where Prot is coaxed back into reality... but Prot is awfully convincing; to the point where he begins weaving the other inpatients under his spell. I must admit I only got halfway though the book until I gave up on it, but the explaination for Prot's situation at the climax of the movie is both sad, frightening and fascinating. You don't have to be a hardcore sci-fi fan to enjoy K-PAX, though it's leisurely pace may turn off some viewers, but overall I recommend this movie.

586652,A33693RRRFK55Q,B00005JKIR,"B. Erickson ""boycorrupted""","[3, 32]","""K-Pax"" is a stupid movie.  I rented it cuz I was bored and thought I'd seen everything else, and (I admit) I actually fell for the ""Two thumbs up!"" pull-quote on the back of the box.  As if that means anything.  Of course, neither do my opinions, but I'll tell you why I think it's stupid and maybe that will be worth something.First of all, this is essentially a TV-movie that somehow acquired a budget.  The dialogue is watered-down sitcom all the way - like at one point the shrink character's wife can tell he's not listening to her so she jokingly tells him her head fell off and she sewed it back on with dental floss, you know, to ""test"" him, and of course he's like ""huh, what about dental floss,"" just to nail home the point that no, he's really not listening.  That is like the oldest, most tired, played-out joke you ever heard on ""Full House,"" and even at that point it had already been beaten to death a billion times.  If you laughed at that joke, what can I say, you are too dull to talk to me.  lol.And the WHOLE SCRIPT is like that.  Dumbed-down, watered-down, played-out, cliched, contrived.  Somebody else said it was an unconventional Hollywood movie that keeps you guessing, makes you use your brain, has a neat surprise open ending.  I bet that person laughs at the jokes on ""Full House.""  No movie was ever more conventional in execution than ""K-Pax."" I suppose the basic concept is marginally, possibly, potentially interesting, but all the interesting ideas it raises are toyed with in the most superficial and arbitrary way possible, then quickly obscured in jargon or idiotically-convenient twists or what-have-you.  The plot paints itself into a corner, then simply leaves the room, over and over again.  The ""open"" ending is just another example of this.  It's NOT ""let's make you think,"" it's ""we didn't feel like thinking, so here ya go, this seems mysterious enough.""  There is a difference, people.As for the acting, Kevin Spacey is good, of course, and can always make his performance interesting, especially if he's playing some sort of freak, cuz he just has that ""quirky"" character-actor's face that makes you think he probably IS on a different trip altogether.  But so what.  He's made stupid movies before, and here's another.  The other guy, I forget his name, the shrink, is just generic middle-aged suburban white guy who thinks he knows everything, straight out of the box.

I found it to be an intriguing combination of the '75 hit `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and the much earlier '51 sci-fi classic `The Day the Earth Stood Still.' Do you sci-fi fans out there remember the name of the large robot with the x-ray eyes in the '51 film? For those who don't it was Gort, a name strikingly similar to that of the supposed humanoid alien Prot played so brilliantly by Kevin Spacey.With 190 reviews already on-line for `K-Pax' there's no need for me to rehash the storyline. I would however like to recommend this film to one and all. It's beautifully filmed and directed complimented by sharp, insightful dialogue containing numerous quotable lines.

Such classic films as &quot;Splash,&quot; &quot;Mr. Mom,&quot; &quot;Tootsie,&quot; and &quot;The Fisher King&quot; draw us in because they are stories of outsiders in unfamiliar situations, who as such shed new light on people, places, and conventional wisdom.&quot;K-Pax&quot; falls neatly into this type of film, and the filmmakers did a good job of maintaining the ambiguity over whether this character is or is not really someone who &quot;traveled to Earth on a beam of light.&quot;  Kevin Spacey's character is altogether convincing as an alien, although one often wonders if an alien would truly reveal so much about his true identity and origins.  In the reality constructed by the screenwriter(s), this is apparently not a problem, while a more paranoid perspective would force the character to mask his/her identity for fear of the &quot;guinea pig syndrome.&quot;I found no wasted space in this film, and the questions I had left were not those that I feel it is the film's job to answer.  In other words, the ambiguity is part of the message, and there's seemingly no fat to trim out of its 2-hour length (although I could nitpick that the main titles dragged interminably at the film's open).  I still wonder what happened to the person who the alien supposedly &quot;took with&quot; him.Definitely worth watching at least a couple of times.  Very engrossing, thoughtful, and thought-provoking.  No film is perfect, and there are a couple of &quot;convenient&quot; devices employed by the filmmakers to get their story told as compactly as possible.

Typically we'd just stop the film and pick up the follwing evening, not with this movie, we had to see the whole thing. In fact one of the first things we talked about this morning was the film and that is quite rare.If you are looking for an action picture, this isn't it, if you're looking for a fun light hearted movie, you are in the wrong place, if you're looking for mindless entertainment, search elsewhere.The reason I'm saying these things is because a lot of previous reviewers that gave this movie a negative review seemed to base it on expectations that had nothing to do with this movie. Perhaps they thought ""Oh, an Alien movie, maybe it'll be like ""Men In Black"" or something along those lines, who knows?While I don't want to do a review on other reviewers I would hate for someone to miss out on the opportunity for seeing a movie that has tremendous depth, that certainly has it's share of lighter moments as well, but this movie will make you think and if thinking isn't enjoyable for you then you won't enjoy this movie.This movie leaves many things unresolved and ends with a sense of mystery, a lot like the way many things in life are. Centered around ""Prot"" who is from the planet ""K-Pax"" he is sent to a place for people with Mental illness. Keven Spacey is incredible in his portrayal of this ""K-Paxian"" and Jeff Bridges is equally brilliant in the role of his Doctor.Throughout the movie you will be as challenged as the Doctor in trying to come to a conclusion about whether ""Prot"" is just a nut-job with a ""Savant like"" intelligence or whether he is in fact an Alien.I won't go into too great detail as many others have already, plus I don't like to give much of a movie away. But this movie is deep in the way ""The Green Mile"" is deep. I found myself waking up last night thinking about this film and that almost never happens. In fact, ""The Green Mile"" was the last film that had this effect on me.There are some highly disturbing moments in this and I would not recommend this to viewers under 14 or 15 years old.

A guy who claims to come from a planet called K-Pax in the Lyra constellation. Obviously, people think he's just a crazy guy and the NYPD takes him directly to a mental institute, where Prot gets to meet Dr. Powell.However, Prot stories are so real, so vivid, so believable, that he can actually convince the other patients that he actually is an extraterrestrial. And Dr. Powell is not the exception, Powell actuall starts to believe what Prot has to tell him. Or at least, he gives him the benefit of the doubt.Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and David Patrick Kelly star in this beautiful film, a story that reminds us that we often close our minds to that we're not familiar with, the fear of the unknown, and how we always try to find an explanation to everything. The acting is marvelous, especially from David Patrick Kelly as Howie, even though is a supporting character it has an incredible charm!The DVD has some cool features, but the only complaint I have about it that cover.

586667,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JKIR,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[3, 4]","This film was not what I expected, not better or worse, just not what I expected.  The film revolves around Prot (Spacey) as he's being treated at a psyciatric facility.  You see Prot claims he's from the planet K-PAX and that he's travled here using light rays and is studying our planet for a report he will submit when he gets home on July 27th.  The question that follows is is he from K-PAX or is he just crazy?  Jeff Bridges plays the doctor trying to get to the bottom of it.  The problem is that as crazy as it all seems, Prot really knows what he's talking about.  He knows of solar systems just being discovered and planets not yet discovered and he speaks with such confidence that he's almost convincing.  Prot also, while staying at the hospital, has helped many of the patients recover from their flaws sort-a-speak.  Herein lies the problem.  The tagline on the front of the DVD says ""it will keep you guessing till the very end"" and the problem with that is that after you turn of the movie you're still guessing.  Is he from K-PAX, is he from Earth?  I still have no clue.  There are many clues pointing the fact that he's just crazy, screwed up by a very tramatic event, but there is another very big clue that could suggest otherwise.  I had a theory shortly after the end of the movie, but I squashed that.  Just, while you watch, remember that he offers to take someone back to K-PAX with him.  Now watch the movie and see if you can figure out just what the hell is going on.  Maybe I should read the book...  Regardless, the acting on all fronts was superb, especially Spacey...It's no wonder he's won TWO oscars.  Spacey is one of the only actors who can command a role like he does, and I don't know, there's just something about this man but whenever he cries in a film I'm brought to tears.  The standout scene in this film is the first time he goes under hypnosis...he commands two charactors and without skipping abeat goes in and out of each of them, without crossing his performance over into the other.  It's  amazing.  All and all, this was a decent film and I would recomend it.  I just wish that the ending were alittle more determinable.  I'd  like to know whether or not I was right in my assumption.  Was he from K-PAX?  I quess you'll have to judge for yourself...and then again, maybe that was the point entirely...",4,And to think I thought this was going to be a comedy...,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,2355,"['film', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'not', 'better', 'worse', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'film', 'Prot', 'Spacey', 'being', 'treated', 'psyciatric', 'facility', 'see', 'Prot', 'claims', 'planet', 'K-PAX', 'travled', 'here', 'using', 'light', 'rays', 'studying', 'planet', 'report', 'will', 'submit', 'when', 'home', 'July', '27th', 'question', 'K-PAX', 'just', 'crazy', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'doctor', 'trying', 'get', 'bottom', 'problem', 'as', 'crazy', 'Prot', 'really', 'what', 'talking', 'about', 'solar', 'systems', 'just', 'being', 'discovered', 'planets', 'not', 'yet', 'discovered', 'such', 'confidence', 'almost', 'convincing', 'Prot', 'also', 'staying', 'hospital', 'helped', 'many', 'patients', 'recover', 'flaws', 'sort-a-speak', 'Herein', 'problem', 'tagline', 'front', 'DVD', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'till', 'very', 'end', 'problem', 'turn', 'movie', ""'re"", 'still', 'guessing', 'K-PAX', 'Earth', 'still', 'have', 'clue', 'are', 'many', 'clues', 'pointing', 'fact', 'just', 'crazy', 'screwed', 'up', 'very', 'tramatic', 'event', 'very', 'big', 'clue', 'could', 'suggest', 'otherwise', 'had', 'theory', 'shortly', 'end', 'movie', 'squashed', 'Just', 'watch', 'remember', 'take', 'someone', 'back', 'K-PAX', 'Now', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'Maybe', 'should', 'read', 'book', 'Regardless', 'acting', 'fronts', 'was', 'superb', 'especially', 'Spacey', 'wonder', 'won', 'TWO', 'oscars', 'Spacey', 'one', 'only', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'command', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'something', 'man', 'whenever', 'film', ""'m"", 'brought', 'tears', 'standout', 'scene', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'hypnosis', 'two', 'charactors', 'skipping', 'abeat', 'crossing', 'performance', 'other', 'amazing', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'would', 'recomend', 'just', 'wish', 'ending', 'were', 'alittle', 'more', 'determinable', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'not', 'was', 'right', 'assumption', 'K-PAX', 'quess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'judge', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'was', 'point', 'entirely']",N/A

That's what makes people's interactions with PROT so interesting... the 'sane' people of the world cannot process the experience of meeting a being who is guilelessly free of all ordinary human conditioning. So they react to this Unknown taking refuge in small, ingrained habits they feel safe acting within. They need to feel they 'know what to do' even when reality shows them a real stumper, regardless of efficacy and the impact on others.In contrast to these frantic-looking 'sane' normal people out in the world, the troubled 'sick' people at the hospital where PROT stays appear (with PROT's presence) to be nearer to the possibility of seeing themselves and reality. Perhaps this is precisely because they are unable to take 'normality' for granted. I think this perhaps conveniently idealizes mental illness for story's sake, and yet there may be a little something to it because yes, saints have been called 'crazy.'

586671,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JKIR,D. Litton,"[11, 27]","In ""K-PAX,"" Kevin Spacey plays a mystical figure who appears ""out of nowhere,"" as a homeless man points out, and makes his way into the life of a psychiatrist badly in need of some family counseling himself. Of course, the question brewing on everyone's mind centers on whether or not Prot (Spacey) is really from a distant, unknown planet, or just a raging lunatic who happens to wear Ray Bans instead of drool on his face.At a running time of two hours, ""K-PAX"" gives us all the answers, but cannot seem to make them appealing in any way, shape or form. We're given subtle clues, those which point to one theory, and those that detract from it. Along the way, we're subjected to various oddities, the most surprising of which turns out to be Spacey himself, who comes off as annoying rather than enigmatic.As Prot, Spacey puts on his usual snide demeanor, mostly reminiscent of his role in ""The Usual Suspects"" once things reversed themselves in the end. He makes nice with Manhattan psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, who exudes a stern, crunched face for much of the film), informing him that he has arrived from a far away planet. Powell begins questioning Prot about his planet, the people who live there, inquiring about things like family and government in hopes of catching his patient in the lie he believes him to be telling.But we, as an audience, know it is not a lie. The movie makes it so with every new development, each new angle, lessening the impact of scenes yet to come. In a meeting with Powell's astronomer acquaintances, Prot reveals to them in not-so-simple terms the location of K-PAX. Powell is informed by a colleague that Prot is able to point out rays of ultraviolet light (but humans can't see UV rays). During a July 4th celebration at Powell's home, he converses with the family dog (to Powell's children: ""She doesn't like it when you sneak up on her""). These instances, accompanied by sudden and lengthy absences of Prot from the psychiatric ward, leave us little choice but to believe in his side of the story.And yet, the movie still insists on throwing in a ridiculously hammy subplot involving various sessions of unbelievably cheesy hypnosis, ties to a friend that calls on Prot for help, and a mystery surrounding his whereabouts on July 27, the day he plans on beaming back to his home planet. As the film reaches a rather moribund conclusion, I was left with more disdain for the film's lack of surprises than I was with thought-provoking questions.And speaking of surprises, who would have thought that the great Spacey could actually turn in such a banal performance? His arrogance befits a role like Lester Burnham, or Verbal Kint, but here, it's pretty clear that his pompous attitude is ill-fitted to his character. He prances around, uttering phrases like ""You humans have no sense of humor;"" when Powell asks him if he's packed and ready to go, he replies, ""Quite ready. I travel light. That's a joke, Mark."" How astute of the film to point that out for us.Bridges is pretty much stuck in another world as Powell, whose back history is never fleshed out to a point where we can feel anything for him. He spends much of his time focusing on his patients, to the point where he neglects his family life. We find out he has a grown son from a previous marriage, a wild card the movie uses to throw in the old themes of reconciliation and one man's self-realization through helping another equally lost soul. Had we been given a chance to know him better, the jig may have worked.Honestly, I wanted to like ""K-PAX."" I wanted to be intrigued by its central character, and I wanted to be mystified by the sinister elements surrounding him.

And it does start off well, Kevin Spacey immediately using his odd, inimitable persona to good effect in the first 10 minutes of the film.But as the minutes ticked past, the movie began to slow down...and down...and then some more.  The narrative simply lumbered to a near-somnambulic pace, and the central question of &quot;Who is this character?&quot; loses its fascination.  Somewhere around the 20-minute mark, the movie begins to manifest its schizophrenic lack of identity:  It can't decide whether it wants to be Awakenings, E.T., or The Sixth Sense.  And by trying to cop elements from each (Awakenings for its institutional spiritual-healing theme, E.T. for the obvious alien fantasy, and The Sixth Sense for plot twists), K-Pax succeeds in evoking none of them, all the while throwing legions of shallow characters, photogenic but overlong shots, and deadbeat astronomical terms at you.Spacey works acceptably, but this was not one of his best roles; the cop-out ambiguity that the script gave to his character does not permit him to explore either the alien or human aspect of his character fully.  While he has good moments, such as in the flashbacks near the end, even his unique charisma wears thin after a while.  The &quot;hypnosis&quot; sequences are so painfully long and drawn out that I almost nodded off.  And Jeff Bridges' character is a cardboard-cutout professional-neglecting-his-family type; Dr. Powell's relationship with his son was never explored, nor does the film really deepen why he is neglecting his wife.  And the not-so-interesting subplot involving the patients at the mental institution is given a tremendous amount of weight, but when it &quot;resolves&quot; at the end (&quot;Bess&quot;), it is entirely unsatisfying.  Director Iain Softley's languishing style and overuse of music don't help; like his previous works Hackers and The Wings of the Dove, it all adds up to much ado about nothing, too much time spent exploring too little content.All through this movie I kept asking the question, &quot;So what?&quot;  So what if Prot is human or not?  So what if the patients did this and that?  So what if a certain star system is a certain way, and so what about &quot;bluebirds&quot;?  Not even Bridges and Spacey could save this one.  K-Pax should've been about an hour and twenty minutes long.

586674,A3VQLTB724O77W,B00005JKIR,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[12, 14]","K-PAX is an excellent film rendition of Gene Brewer's novel of the same name.  Where Brewer's novel was somewhat terse, told largely in the form of psychiatrist's notes, the film is much more lyrical.  What debate there may be as to the superiority of a particular version surely lies in the nature of the particular medium, and the film's changes made from the novel are largely to take advantage of its enhanced visual and dialogue aspects.  Cinematography and art direction were superb, and the music (a sort of Mike Oldfield/Tubular Bells homage by Ed Shearmur) fit the film perfectly.  Director Ian Softley and screenwriter Charles Leavitt deserve kudos for keeping the spirit of Brewer's entrancing novel alive.Especially noteworthy is the acting.  Jeff Bridges and Mary McCormack do a wonderful job supporting Kevin Spacey.  You really have to admire Spacey for exercising such selectivity over his projects, and here, as in American Beauty, he is at his peculiar best, a real delight to watch.  Some viewers may find K-PAX a challenge, as it deals more with questions than answers; some will be disappointed that it doesn't meet their expectations as a science fiction film, or resemble One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest more.  I submit that they have missed the point of the film altogether, which is as a gentle character study of a man caught in tragic circumstances, colored with a sense of wonder and social commentary delivered with magical realism.  K-PAX is a real delight in both film and print forms; the novel also has an excellent sequel ON A BEAM OF LIGHT and a final member of the trilogy is due out soon.

Having seen this movie before I read the book, I could easily see these people in the roles in the book.  I thought the adaptation of the script was rather respectful to the book.  Though not perfect, and missing a main character, the movie really did get the book's mystery across rather successfully.  The thing I liked about the movie, is the fact that it isn't as one sided as the book.  The book is written in first person from the perspective of the Jeff Daniels character, the psychologist named ""Dr. Mark Powell"".  A film obviously is much more difficult to work in this fashion.  The movie is warmer than the book too, which is a plus.Anyway, enough about the book.  The movie revolves around a psychologist who gets a new patient who calls himself ""prot"" (rhymes with goat).  ""prot,"" is either an alien from the planet K-PAX or he is a convincing delusional.  With ""prot's"" scheduled departure date, Bridges character ""Dr. Powell,"" is in a race against time to find out ""prot's"" real identity, if he has an identity at all.  ""prot"" influences many of those who are institutionalized at the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, as well as much of the staff, as he promises that he will take one of them home with him to K-PAX.  That's all I can say without giving anything away.  I have no interest in spoiling such a wonderful story.The movie moves very well.  I love the character interaction.  The cast is pure gold.  Kevin Spacey is remarkable as usual.  There isn't really anything bad about this movie at all.  And any nitpicking that I would point out, however trivial, would be a spoiler.  I will just have to ask you to trust my judgment that this movie is fun, brilliant, and rather captivating.  Rent it once, and you'll buy it.

He is so incredibly talented and human in his role of Prot, an alien from the planet, K-PAX.This is the kind of film where by the end you are contemplating what the truth is.  That said, I will not say much more about the outcome of the story.I think that K-PAX as a film is an okay movie. It's not the greatest of the year.  So why do I give it five stars?SPACEY!!  This is an actor who loves his craft and seems genuinely happy doing it.  He takes on a project and dives into it full force, putting his heart and soul into every role he takes on.  He is very passionate about his work.For those diehard fans of Kevin Spacey, this film is worth the rental fee.  He is so wonderful in this.  He truly brings the character of Prot to life, and you feel that you really know him.  He delivers his lines so perfectly, and he has a great range of emotion.  He isn't afraid of anything.  This is a true professional actor!K-PAX is the story of a psychiatrist, played by, in my opinion, a miscast Jeff Bridges.  Jeff plays Dr. Mark Powell.  A man that is so into his job that he loses his first wife, and his son won't even talk to him.  He is remarried to Rachel, played by Mary MacCormack.  They have two daughters together.  So, I believe Mark is trying to be more into family, but he is really just into his work so deep he often ignores them.He especially gets into his work when he gets a new patient, Prot, a self-proclaimed alien, who appears as a human.Prot's knowledge of astronomy is incredible, and impresses the colleagues of Powell's astronomer friend.Dr. Powell is amazed at Prot.  He is totally enthralled by this patient and spends a great deal of his time trying to help him get mentally well. Prot seems perfectly fine except for being an alien from the planet K-PAX.All the while, the other patients are totally amorous of Prot. He wants to help, and does help to cure a few of the other patients.Dr. Powell gets so close to Prot that he invites him over to his house.  This is when the trouble starts.  Water, sprinklers... and Prot goes from a calm man pushing a little girl on a swing to a raving lunatic.Of course, Powell only gets more entrigued and wants to try hypnosis. Through hypnosis, Powell is able to learn of Prot's life and the truth...or does he?Even though it is a thought provoking film, Jeff Bridges character is just confusing.  It is never made clear to the audience that he is good.  Sure, he is a doctor of psychiatry, but that doesn't make him a saint.  His priorities are out of whack, but he wants to help people too.  Maybe we aren't supposed to like him but we want to? Also, Bridges looked tired and bored in this movie.  His acting was terrible.I digress.  Spacey is worth watching.

Ok, definitely a bit more.It was one of those movies I got completely swept up in; I was totally oblivious of anyone else in the theatre except for my boyfriend. The movie was fabulous, Kevin Spacey was fabulous, Jeff Bridges was fabulous. The direction was fabulous. The cinematography was fabulous. It was fabulous. It left a lot of questions unanswered, and not the ones you might think, and only one of which stands out (to me) as a huge incongruity.The way the director played with light and color was beautiful, sometimes stunning. And, sometimes, a bit over-the-top, but not often. As the movie began and started to play out, I completely believed Prot was from K-PAX - there wasn't any reason not to. But then, of course, evidence comes to light making the viewer doubt the validity of his claim. I fervently hoped he was from K-PAX, but I was absolutely terrified that Hollywood was, once again, going to crush all hope and end it all with some ultra-left-brain, no-room-for-wonder ending. As the story progresses, though, whether or not he's from K-PAX becomes less and less important. The layers peel back, and peel further back, and ... well, I'm not going to ruin it for you. I was on the edge of my seat until the very last second of the movie, and I wouldn't deprive you of the same pleasure.It's not that the story is startlingly original, or that the screenplay is overwhelmingly creative...it's everything.

586681,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKIR,"""flickjunkie""","[15, 17]","K-Pax is a very intriguing film.  Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really an alien, or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien?  That is the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth.As the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered, both theories grow in credibility.  His ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess.  Yet the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration.  The ending seems to give the answer, but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know.  Normally, I don't like lady or tiger endings, but this one is tantalizing.  I have my own theory that fits all the clues, but I don't know that my theory is any more correct than anyone else's.Director Iain Softley (""Wings of the Dove"") spins the tale delicately, with great skill.  This is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate.  This is not to say that the directing is technically inferior, because it is excellent, especially the cinematography.  However, Softley remains unobtrusive, delivering great power through the use of subtlety, a pleasant change from today's vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream, ""Look how brilliant I am!""Kevin Spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as Prot.  This is a part that is extraordinarily demanding, requiring Spacey to render the cool and logical Prot one minute, and then switch gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next.  Spacey is so believable as both alien and human, it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult.  Jeff Bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot.This is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer.  I rated it a 9/10.

The first half of the movie has a much lighter tone and is the most fun, as we learn about Prot, Spacey's otherworldly (literally) character from the planet K-PAX, and the relationship between Bridges, the psychiatrist, and Spacey, is developed. The scene where Spacey confounds the astronomers with his knowledge of astrophysics is especially good.But the movie takes on a distinctly dark and sinister tone in the second half, as Dr. Powell becomes convinced that Spacey could turn violent and sets out to discover the true nature of Spacey's past, which leads him to an abandoned farm in New Mexico.My only big complaint is that they could have found a better ending. By the end of the movie, you've come to like and sympathize with the unworldly, eccentric but likable Prot character, but then he basiclly turns into a vegetable at the end of the film.

These two heavyweights are brilliant in this fantastic tale about Prot (Spacey), a highly advanced visitor  from a neighboring star system. At least that is what he appears to be for most of the film... advanced enough to travel on a beam of light, to know the precise mathematical equations to describe the orbit of his planet, and to make significant progress helping his fellow mental patients, and his psychiatrist (Bridges) in a very short time. But what happens when Bridges begins to learn more and more about Prot's past ?As soon as I saw K-PAX, I knew it was a must-own for my collection. The hard part was deciding whether to classify it under science fiction or drama. Although I decided on sci-fi, it's really more of a touching human drama, with warmth and caring, and just enough humor to make repeat viewing a joy.Anyone who says the plot is weak is really missing the point.

Director Ian Softley has created a mood that begins with the very first scene in which a stranger saves a woman from muggers and is locked up in a mental ward for his troubles.  For much of the film, this mood is one which leads the viewer first to the starkness of daily gritty existence and then back to a magical land where unexplained events occur to confound those who laugh at them.  Kevin Spacey plays Prot, a man who insists that he comes from K-Pax, a planet in a far away star system and to which he intends to return, despite the rule of the sanitarium that frowns on the unauthorized comings and goings of its residents.  While locked up, Prot finds himself in an environment not unlike the one previously inhabited by McMurphy in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST.  Instead of Nurse Ratched, there is the cold-hearted administrator, Dr. Villars, played by the too-attractive Alfre Woodard.  Prot is examined by Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) , a psychiatrist who begins his interviews with Prot as a realist but exits the movie as a believer.  As did McMurphy in OFOTCN, Prot riles up the other residents by making them believe that he is truly from another world.  As they begin to believe, so does Dr. Powell and so does the viewer.  Prot seems to know things that no ordinary person can know.  He dispenses common sense advice that helps the residents and Dr.Powell in their private lives.  He even goes to an observatory and gives the resident astrophysicists detailed astronomical formulae that suggest his knowledge of the heavens did not come from a star atlas.  Director Softley deliberately keeps the viewer in the dark about exactly who this Prot is.  Dr.Powell tries to find out the background of the man called Prot, but his findings are no help in unclouding a very muddy issue of who we are and why we do things the way we do.  By the end of the film, Prot tells us more about ourselves than he does about himself, and it is this lighthearted journey toward a collective insight into each other that renders K-PAX a charm that promises to endure even after multiple viewings.",4,A Fairy Tale Well Told,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,2242,"['K-PAX', 'real', 'world', 'semi-fantasy', 'land', 'previously', 'inhabited', 'such', 'disparate', 'films', 'ET', 'IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', 'Director', 'Ian', 'Softley', 'created', 'mood', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'stranger', 'woman', 'muggers', 'locked', 'up', 'mental', 'ward', 'troubles', 'much', 'film', 'mood', 'one', 'viewer', 'first', 'starkness', 'daily', 'gritty', 'existence', 'then', 'back', 'magical', 'land', 'where', 'unexplained', 'events', 'occur', 'confound', 'who', 'laugh', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Prot', 'man', 'who', 'K-Pax', 'planet', 'far', 'away', 'star', 'system', 'return', 'rule', 'sanitarium', 'unauthorized', 'comings', 'goings', 'residents', 'locked', 'up', 'Prot', 'environment', 'not', 'one', 'previously', 'inhabited', 'McMurphy', 'ONE', 'FLEW', 'THE', 'CUCKOOS', 'NEST', 'Instead', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'cold-hearted', 'administrator', 'Dr.', 'Villars', 'played', 'too-attractive', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Prot', 'examined', 'Dr.', 'Mark', 'Powell', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'interviews', 'Prot', 'realist', 'movie', 'believer', 'did', 'McMurphy', 'OFOTCN', 'Prot', 'up', 'other', 'residents', 'making', 'believe', 'truly', 'world', 'begin', 'believe', 'so', 'Dr.', 'Powell', 'so', 'viewer', 'Prot', 'know', 'things', 'ordinary', 'person', 'can', 'know', 'common', 'sense', 'advice', 'residents', 'Dr.Powell', 'private', 'lives', 'even', 'observatory', 'resident', 'detailed', 'astronomical', 'formulae', 'suggest', 'knowledge', 'heavens', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'star', 'atlas', 'Director', 'Softley', 'deliberately', 'viewer', 'dark', 'exactly', 'who', 'Prot', 'Dr.Powell', 'find', 'out', 'background', 'man', 'called', 'Prot', 'findings', 'are', 'help', 'unclouding', 'very', 'muddy', 'issue', 'who', 'are', 'why', 'do', 'things', 'way', 'do', 'end', 'film', 'Prot', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'journey', 'collective', 'insight', 'other', 'K-PAX', 'charm', 'endure', 'even', 'multiple', 'viewings']",N/A

586710,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKIR,Matthew Horner,"[4, 6]","I wish I could be more enthusiastic about ""K-PAX"" because it has a lot going for it. It pairs two of the world's greatest actors, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. It is exquisitely photographed and carefully edited. A well-meaning film, it does its utmost to celebrate the human spirit. In the end, however, it is like a gourmet meal that's great looking but, unfortunately, has an ingredient or two missing.We first meet Prot [Spacey] in New York's Grand Central Station where he is mistakenly accused of a mugging. When he confidently states that he's from K-PAX, a planet 1,000 light years from here, he gets sent to a psychiatric hospital. Dr. Mark Powell [Bridges], the doctor assigned to treat him, discovers that Prot is both remarkably intelligent and highly convincing. As time goes on, some intriguing incidents cause Powell, who is experiencing problems in his own life, to consider that his patient may be telling the truth. At the same time, the doctor is too professional and well-trained to give in easily to such a bizarre possibility.Despite the conventional plot device of a supposedly delusional man's being placed in an institution, the story works well for the first half, thanks in large part to the actors and to director Iain Softley's keen instincts. The story begins to crumble when Powell decides to hypnotize Prot. This leads to a lot of psycho-babble about repressed memories. While these scenes serve to keep up the suspense over whether or not Prot is an alien, they also signal that the filmmakers were running out of ideas - or at least ideas they felt the average movie-goer would accept.In defense of `K-PAX', making a convincing movie about a super intelligent alien can't be easy. A very bright writer can occasionally come up with ideas that truly seem to originate in another world. But even when he or she does this, these ideas must be watered down for the average person to understand them. Since commercial movies are by nature a mass medium, this dilution process is a given. Thankfully, it isn't possible to dilute the intelligence or the talent of either Mr. Spacey or Mr. Bridges. They nearly cause the movie to succeed in spite of itself.",3,Spacey and Bridges are the reasons the see this,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2184,"['wish', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'K-PAX', 'lot', 'going', 'pairs', 'two', 'world', 'greatest', 'actors', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'exquisitely', 'photographed', 'carefully', 'edited', 'well-meaning', 'film', 'utmost', 'celebrate', 'human', 'spirit', 'end', 'however', 'gourmet', 'meal', 'great', 'looking', 'unfortunately', 'ingredient', 'two', 'missing.We', 'first', 'meet', 'Prot', '[', 'Spacey', ']', 'New', 'York', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'where', 'mistakenly', 'accused', 'mugging', 'When', 'confidently', 'K-PAX', 'planet', '1,000', 'light', 'years', 'here', 'sent', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'Dr.', 'Mark', 'Powell', '[', 'Bridges', ']', 'doctor', 'assigned', 'treat', 'discovers', 'Prot', 'remarkably', 'intelligent', 'highly', 'convincing', 'time', 'intriguing', 'incidents', 'cause', 'Powell', 'who', 'experiencing', 'problems', 'own', 'life', 'consider', 'patient', 'may', 'be', 'telling', 'truth', 'same', 'time', 'doctor', 'too', 'professional', 'well-trained', 'give', 'easily', 'such', 'bizarre', 'possibility.Despite', 'conventional', 'plot', 'device', 'supposedly', 'delusional', 'man', 'being', 'placed', 'institution', 'story', 'well', 'first', 'half', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'actors', 'director', 'Iain', 'Softley', 'keen', 'instincts', 'story', 'crumble', 'when', 'Powell', 'hypnotize', 'Prot', 'lot', 'psycho-babble', 'repressed', 'memories', 'scenes', 'serve', 'keep', 'up', 'suspense', 'not', 'Prot', 'alien', 'also', 'signal', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'ideas', 'least', 'ideas', 'felt', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'would', 'accept.In', 'defense', 'K-PAX', 'making', 'convincing', 'movie', 'super', 'intelligent', 'alien', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'very', 'bright', 'writer', 'can', 'occasionally', 'come', 'up', 'ideas', 'truly', 'seem', 'originate', 'world', 'even', 'when', 'ideas', 'must', 'be', 'watered', 'down', 'average', 'person', 'understand', 'commercial', 'movies', 'are', 'nature', 'mass', 'medium', 'dilution', 'process', 'given', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'possible', 'dilute', 'intelligence', 'talent', 'Mr.', 'Spacey', 'Mr.', 'Bridges', 'nearly', 'cause', 'movie', 'succeed', 'spite']",N/A

That was the thought I was having as I went in to see ""K-Pax,"" a film in which Kevin Spacey plays a mysterious mental patient named prot, whom may or may not be an alien from a far away planet called K-Pax. On going into the theater I thought that I'd probably come out of it two hours later thinking Kevin Spacey was fantastic but that the rest of the movie was contrived; just some sort of cheap convention to show off Kevin Spacey's acting. I was very wrong indeed.""K-Pax"" is a wonderful film that plays with the mind almost as much as it plays with the heart. For the first part of the film (The first ""act,"" as it were) you're convinced that Kevin Spacey is one thing. Then by the second part (Act Two) you're gradually convinced he's something entirely different. Then, by the third part (Act Three) you're turned completely on your head and don't know what to think. Throughout all of this, ""K-Pax"" is filled with a touching form of sentimentality that, while walking a thin line between touching and corny, manages to succeed and genuinely move the audience.Most of the performances are great. As mentioned before, Kevin Spacey has an amazing talent for acting and his performance here is no exception; he definitely could carry this film, he just doesn't need to. Jeff Bridges (as the psychologist who studies Spacey) also gives a wonderful performance that's strong and touching, albeit a bit more low-key than Spacey's performance. In fact, the only actor who doesn't give a good performance in the film is Mary McCormack as Jeff Bridges' wife. She plays her role too one-note and eventually grows tedious to watch. This is a minor qualm, however, in an utterly fantastic film. ""K-Pax"" is certainly one of the underdog hits of 2001.One minor note: Much attention has been given to the fact that the movie definitely makes you think. I find this to be most wondeful and fantastic, but I do know many so-called film ""fans"" who hate films they actually have to use their brains on. So, just a warning, ""K-Pax"" may not be your cup of tea if you don't like movies that make you think, or you don't like movies that don't have ""concrete"" endings that wrap the film up, all neat and tidy.",4,"""K-Pax"" is a Fantastic Film in Three Acts",1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,2338,"[""'ve"", 'often', 'been', 'fan', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'have', 'often', 'felt', 'strong', 'acting', 'capability', 'can', 'carry', 'whole', 'film', 'need', 'be', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'having', 'went', 'see', 'K-Pax', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'mysterious', 'mental', 'patient', 'named', 'prot', 'whom', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'alien', 'far', 'away', 'planet', 'called', 'K-Pax', 'going', 'theater', 'thought', ""'d"", 'probably', 'come', 'two', 'hours', 'later', 'thinking', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'was', 'fantastic', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'contrived', 'just', 'sort', 'cheap', 'convention', 'show', 'off', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'wrong', 'indeed', 'K-Pax', 'wonderful', 'film', 'mind', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'heart', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'first', 'act', 'were', ""'re"", 'convinced', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'one', 'thing', 'Then', 'second', 'part', 'Act', 'Two', ""'re"", 'gradually', 'convinced', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'Then', 'third', 'part', 'Act', 'Three', ""'re"", 'turned', 'completely', 'head', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'K-Pax', 'filled', 'touching', 'form', 'sentimentality', 'walking', 'thin', 'line', 'touching', 'corny', 'succeed', 'genuinely', 'move', 'audience.Most', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'mentioned', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'amazing', 'talent', 'acting', 'performance', 'here', 'exception', 'definitely', 'could', 'carry', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'need', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'psychologist', 'who', 'studies', 'Spacey', 'also', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'strong', 'touching', 'bit', 'more', 'low-key', 'Spacey', 'performance', 'fact', 'only', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'give', 'good', 'performance', 'film', 'Mary', 'McCormack', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'wife', 'role', 'too', 'one-note', 'eventually', 'tedious', 'watch', 'minor', 'qualm', 'however', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'film', 'K-Pax', 'certainly', 'one', 'underdog', 'hits', '2001.One', 'minor', 'note', 'Much', 'attention', 'been', 'given', 'fact', 'movie', 'definitely', 'think', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'wondeful', 'fantastic', 'do', 'know', 'many', 'so-called', 'film', 'fans', 'who', 'hate', 'films', 'actually', 'have', 'use', 'brains', 'So', 'just', 'warning', 'K-Pax', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'make', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'concrete', 'endings', 'wrap', 'film', 'up', 'neat', 'tidy']",N/A

This is the kind of story that can make us WANT to believe.Meet &quot;Prot&quot; (played by Kevin Spacey), the mysterious stranger with no apparent past whose claims to be an alien from the planet K-Pax promptly earn him a trip to the local psychiatric hospital.  His treating psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (played by Jeff Bridges), initially treats Prot as just another routine case, dismissing his odd claims and &quot;alien&quot; behavior as just the products of a sick mind.  Over time, however, Prot begins to do, say and know things that Powell simply cannot ignore.  Could there be some truth to his claims?  Following a fascinating demonstration at the local planetarium, which both confounds and amazes an assembly of distinguished scientests, the remotely plausible starts to become dramatically more convincing.All the other patients at the hospital love Prot, and are soon infected by his deeply held expectation that the &quot;mother ship&quot; will, in fact, return to pick him up.  They even go so far as to prepare a sending-off party, and to hold an essay contest to decide who will be the one lucky person who gets to go with him.  Nevertheless, Prot seems, for all his claims and otherworldly behavior, to be a very normal, lucid individual -- quite harmless to himself or others.Powell thus feels comfortable to take him to meet the family.  All goes well at first, but when an innocuous event begins to awaken some deeply repressed memories, Prot undergoes a sudden change.  It is here that the viewer gains new insights into the disturbing and tragic past of this man who calls himself by an alien name.  It all begins to make sense now -- or so it seems.Just as we start to think we understand who Prot is and why he acts as he does, the ending of the movie takes an unexpected twist that causes us to question -- and to hope -- yet again.  The fate of Prot is never made clear, and I think that's what turns an otherwise merely good movie into a great one.  The viewer is left with his sense of grief and tragedy competing with a sense of inspiration and hope.  I guess each viewer decides which one wins, but for me it was hope.  I enjoyed believing in something good for a change -- doesn't matter whether I was right or wrong.  Great movie!",5,"Phenomenal performances, gripping story.

Spacey could be a man from another planet, here visiting earth, who gets caught up in psychiatric evaluation program when he is admitted to hospital for talking strange to a cop. It has all the hallmarks of what could be a great film.Sadly it is very long and boring and the film never really does explain much. One of the main problems with this film is that we have seen it done before.. and better. The next problem is that Bridges character sometimes defies belief. One moment he has almost solid evidence that Spacey is an alien. Next he is treating him like a patient. This juxtaposition is incorrectly proportioned in the film and gives Bridge's a lack of credibility. When we the audience have seen something that makes Spacey an alien, Bridges is treating him like a patient and when Spacey does something that makes us think he is mentally ill, Bridges is treating him like an alien. Then we have the whole problem of how this is never really resolved and the director just lashes on with heaps of sentimentality to help mask the films many flaws.To be honest I did not want to watch this film past the first 20 minutes and it was very hard to stay with it until the end.

The alien's name is prot and he claims to have traveled to Earth by a beam on light.  Of course because of his claims he is arrested and taken to a mental institute and examined.  The funny thing is, there are funny things about prot-- he can detect UV light- when it's a fact that no human can, he can take doses of drugs and not be affected, and he can eat a banana whole-- ok, not too weird, but you get the jist.Dr. Powell is prot's physiatrist.  At first Dr. Powell ignores the strange unhumanlike qualities that prot posses, but after a while, becomes more and more unsure-- maybe prot is not a psychotic delusional after all, maybe he IS an alien!

What becomes surprising is his unusual behavior and his knowledge about outer space which befuddles even the top experts in the field.  He is placed in the care of Dr. Mark Powell, played by Jeff Bridges, who thinks there might just be a much more Earth-based explanation for what is going on.  This is a very good film and one of Kevin Spacey's better projects.  All the emotions are placed just right, allowing the audience to experience them right alongside the characters.  The plot is intriguing, keeping you guessing as the clues point one way and then another.  And the ending's ambiguity fits the entire film's ambiguity like a glove.

To my surprise, K-Pax is now one of my all-time favorite movies, and I've watched it perhaps a half-dozen times.Interestingly, with each viewing I learn more.  The movie is blessed with many subtle turns.Here's what I've learned:1) Prot is definitely an alien.  There are two irrefutable clues to this: He sees ultra-violet light (which humans cannot), and is immune to powerful psychotic drugs (which humans are not).  But it's not so simple.  Prot's a ""walk-in.""  Meaning (as Prot explains during hypnosis), he comes to earth whenever his human friend needs him and, apparently, enters his friend's body - the two becoming one.  And this alien/human hybrid can travel via light beams (hence Prot's going north for a few days while institutionalized).2) When Prot's human friend experienced a profound tragedy five years earlier, Prot took over the human body.3) When Prot departs at the movie's end (apparently taking Bess), the body of his friend remains.  Thus, there is no ambiguity.  Prot IS alien; he simply inhabited a human body.This is a great, well-acted and well-edited movie.  Vastly underrated.

Williams ""just an avid reader""","[0, 2]","The movie is interesting, clever, but ultimately unsatisfying.It poses what appears to be a simple question: prot, the lead character, is either from the planet K-Pax or he is a crazy man pushed into madness by the brutal destruction of his wife and daughter, and his murder of their tormentor.But it is not a simple question, not in an age of materialism and scientific evidence as the only valid form of knowledge. Going crazy, even if for a good reason, and getting into touch with aliens from another world, the hybrid solution of the two possibilities is not a synthesis of science but of literature and art and therefore unacceptable to our modern mindset. Which only sees things in their ""true, scientific, actual, real form"". He either is or he isn't. He is crazy and the movie is about a psychiatrist treating his patient or he is an alien and the psychiatrist is blind to reality because of his blinders to a greater reality than he can see before him.The movie is partly a mirror into our way of thinking, into what we will allow to be reality, what possibilities we think can exist. We can allow the movie to be sci fi and suspend our disbelief because of the genre and accept K-Pax as a real planet and prot as a traveler from it. But we know this is not real, it is sci fi, it is literary escapism. It doesn't effect our real view of what is real.Or it can be a psychological thriller, or how the psychiatrist solved the problem of the crazy man claiming to be an alien. This is real, we all know people who wear aluminum hats, we all have seen the homeless boxing with God, and we all know it is just a chemical imbalance, often self inducted, that perturbs their brain into an alternative reality, just for them. Their reality isn't real so it doesn't disturb our way of thinking about the real reality, our reality the least little bit.But we are given contradictory clues, he disappears (oddly enough simultaneously in real time Kevin Spacey does work in Newfoundland on ""Shipping News""), Bess disappears, his box of collected things disappears, he knows things that puzzle the professional astronomers yet he remains catatonic after he catches the 5:47 lightbeam back to K-Pax.In any case, the movie strives for more than it achieves, it asks questions then doesn't seem to rise up to them to attempt answers. It is as if the writers took the novels it is derived from and lost significant pieces in the transition to a screen play.

I think it would have been a lot more effective to leave the resolution up to the mind of the viewer. The quandary is whether Prot (Kevin Spacey), who seems to all-of-a-sudden ""materialize"" in the middle of Grand Central Station, is an alien from a far-off planet called K-PAX or just a severely delusional homo sapien. Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) is his psychiatrist who is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery. Prot has an impregnable exterior, and definitely does some impressive things, like describe to some of the Powell's astronomer friends exactly where his home planet is. But during some intense therapy sessions we learn (as you might expect) that there is something brewing beneath the surface.This movie would have been terrific, would really be a thought-provoker, would cause you to stop and think about how you perceive the world and other people, if it had ended about 10-20 minutes before it actually did. If one sequence towards the end was cut out, and the film ended right after the climactic scene, the viewer would have a lot to ponder, to wonder, ""Did what I think just happen really happen?"", and the legacy of ""K-PAX"" as a great fantasy would have been assured.

Although in hindsight a  little trite with a somewhat predictable ending (to me), the dangling question of a psychiatric patient being an alien or just a human oddball was entertaining, and thought provoking.It's not easy to make a film where the question of fantasy or reality is not decided.

Sure there are bigger stars, but the film wouldn't have been as good without these two. The film leaves you to make up your own mind about Prot. Could he be autistic? This is one possibility to explain his talents. However you'll have to see the film to decide whether he's an Alien or not.In some ways this is a sister film to John Carpenter's Starman in which Jeff Bridges played the Alien. Like that earlier film K-Pax is both moving and wonderous. I have watched it many times and still can't understand why neither of the leading Actors received any recognition in terms of the major film awards (Oscars, Cannes etc).

586742,A3SQZCA0JFB5CV,B00005JKIR,S Martin,"[1, 2]","I didn't know what to expect of KPax when we rented it. I'd read reviews saying it was pretty disappointing, and not what people expected, so I was apprehensive when we rented it. Despite the bad reviews, I really liked this movie.What I liked most about the movie is that nowhere in it do they actually find enough proof to determine whether Prot is truly an alien or if he's just a delusional man.  Every time you come to the conclusion he's on or the other, something happens that shakes your conclusion a little.  You may think he's an alien, but then he shows an unexplained fear of the sprinkler. Or, you think he's human, but then find out he can see UV light. Even the ending of the movie is not clear whether he's an alien or not, it hints in one direction, but you make your own decision.The one thing that I really noticed about the film is it's slow. It takes its time to get from beginning to end, which can be tedious if you have a short attention span. Part of the reason the film seems slow is it's more than just a story about a man who many or may not be an alien, it also revolves around the psychiatrist that treats him. As the psychiatrist treats him he begins to become more or less obsessed with finding out where Prot comes from, and debunking the idea he's an alien. Along the way, as he uncovers things, he realizes that there's more to life than being a psychiatrist, and begins to spend more time away from his office, with his wife and kids. This second plot intertwines with the primary storyline, and for those who want a straight foreward alien movie will be disappointed.Overall I think the film is extremely well done. One thing that struck me as different is that the theme music for Kpax reminded me of the music for Forrest Gump. In a way it's fitting, Prot has a childlike aura around him that shows through from time to time, much like the childlike feeling you get from Forrest Gump. The whole movie has an eretheral quality to it that dazzles you a bit, and let you believe, if only for a moment, that aliens do exist and do visit earth.",4,Is he really an alien or a delusional man?,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,2078,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'KPax', 'when', 'rented', ""'d"", 'read', 'reviews', 'saying', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'not', 'what', 'people', 'expected', 'was', 'apprehensive', 'when', 'rented', 'bad', 'reviews', 'really', 'liked', 'movie.What', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'do', 'actually', 'find', 'enough', 'proof', 'determine', 'Prot', 'truly', 'alien', 'just', 'delusional', 'man', 'time', 'come', 'conclusion', 'other', 'something', 'conclusion', 'little', 'may', 'think', 'alien', 'then', 'unexplained', 'fear', 'sprinkler', 'think', 'human', 'then', 'find', 'can', 'see', 'UV', 'light', 'Even', 'ending', 'movie', 'not', 'clear', 'alien', 'not', 'one', 'direction', 'make', 'own', 'decision.The', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'noticed', 'film', 'slow', 'time', 'get', 'beginning', 'end', 'can', 'be', 'tedious', 'have', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'Part', 'reason', 'film', 'slow', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'many', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'alien', 'also', 'psychiatrist', 'psychiatrist', 'become', 'more', 'less', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'out', 'where', 'Prot', 'debunking', 'idea', 'alien', 'way', 'things', 'more', 'life', 'being', 'psychiatrist', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'away', 'office', 'wife', 'kids', 'second', 'plot', 'intertwines', 'primary', 'storyline', 'who', 'want', 'straight', 'foreward', 'alien', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.Overall', 'think', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'One', 'thing', 'struck', 'different', 'theme', 'music', 'Kpax', 'reminded', 'music', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'way', 'fitting', 'Prot', 'childlike', 'aura', 'time', 'time', 'much', 'childlike', 'feeling', 'get', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'whole', 'movie', 'eretheral', 'quality', 'bit', 'let', 'believe', 'only', 'moment', 'aliens', 'do', 'exist', 'do', 'visit', 'earth']",N/A

586747,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B00005JKIR,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[2, 2]","+++++This 2001 movie (120 minutes) consists of eighteen scenes.  It is based on the novel of the same title by Gene Brewer.  Like the novel, this movie is part mystery, part comedy, and part human drama.The story is about a man who claims to come from the utopian world called K-PAX (a planet he says is in the constellation Lyra).  This man is the prot-agonist of the movie and calls himself Prot (Kevin Spacey).Excellent cinematography is one of the highlights of this movie.  For example, the way Prot (pronounced pr-OAT) is introduced to the movie viewer is truly amazing.  At the beginning of of the movie, we find ourselves in a busy and crowded train station and gradually the sunlight coming through the station windows brightens.  Then the crowd parts and we see Prot standing in the center of the station floor with his sunglasses on.  It's as if he entered the station ""on a beam of light.""Eventually, Prot ends up in a mental institution and the psychiatrist that treats him is Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges).  Most of the movie is concerned with the interaction and relationship that develops between Prot and Powell.The acting, especially among the above two actors, is another highlight of this movie.  Spacey does a superb job of getting across Prot's wit, humor, and extensive knowledge (especially in sciences like astronomy and physics).  He also gets across Prot's passion for eating fruit.  Bridges, as the psychiatrist Powell, does a great job in trying to analyze Prot. Powell finds Prot quite rational and later admits that this patient is ""the most convincing delusional I've ever seen.""One of the best and most colorful scenes occurs at a planetarium where Prot demonstrates to some distinguished astonomers and astrophysicists that he knows the precise orbital pattern of his home planet in a newly discovered star system.  The thing is he should not know this information!  As well, Prot demonstrates certain otherworldly abilities.  Thus Powell and the movie viewer don't know if Prot is indeed an extraterrestrial or a traumatized human.Prot has a positive influence on all the people he meets especially on Dr. Powell, his family, and other patients in the mental institution.  This gives the movie a certain warmth.Suspense is created when Prot tells Powell that he must eventually return to K-PAX.  As well, even though all his fellow patients want to go with him to his utopian world, he states that one can only come with him.  As the announced ""departure"" date approaches, the question asked by Powell is: ""What will happen when this day arrives?""  As well, the other patients wonder whom Prot will choose to go with him.This movie is perfect for the first 80 minutes.  It retains its wit and humor for that time.  After this, the movie seems to lose its humor and becomes serious.  For about 15 of the remaining 40 minutes, Powell does some investigative footwork and he has no further interaction with Prot.  In my opinion, this was a mistake since (as mentioned above) this story revolves around the interaction between Powell and Prot.  (Note that the novel never loses its humor until the very end and an investigative reporter does all the investigative footwork thus allowing Powell and Prot to maintain their interaction.)  However, some movie viewers may forgive this because the story is so engrossing.The ending is well done.  The movie ends on an ambiguous note and leaves you wondering.  (However, some viewers may not think that the ending is ambiguous.)  An ambiguous ending is also found in the novel.Thus this movie ends and the end credits start rolling.  The movie is over.  Right?  Wrong!  I'm not sure why this was done (and it seems that other reviewers never noticed this), but the movie actually continues AFTER the end credits have stopped!!  (I found this out by accident.)  For about a minute, we have a scene (with no dialogue) where Powell is looking through a telescope at a constellation.  Readers of the novel will understand what this means but those who have not read the novel will probably not understand its significance.  Then the movie ends.Yet another highlight of this movie is its music.  In a word, it's--beautiful.  It is hard to describe but I might call it ""quiet new age.""  This music seems to heighten the emotion experienced in each scene.Finally, you don't have to read the novel to understand this movie.  However, if you want to understand its finer nuances, I recommend that you read the novel first.In conclusion, this movie is one that has extraordinary acting, cinematography, and music.  Be sure not to miss this magical movie so you can experience what it's like to ""catch a beam of light.""**** 1/2+++++",4,Is he an extraterrestrial?

I believe reviews that give it all away are like Cliff Notes. Why see the DVD? You need to see the movie and be surprised/entertained. And this film will entertain you completely.I put this DVD in my player expecting a comedy (per the tv hype and trailers). True to this usual misleading media hype, K-Pax is not a comedy. It turned out to be one of the most poignant and engrossing films I have seen in the last year. Kevin Spacey IS `Prot', a supposed visitor from the planet K-Pax, who is arrested by New York cops for no reason other than he attempts to thwart a purse robbery, and help the victim (I immediately wanted to b-slap the cops for stupity). Jeff Bridges is the tired shrink, oblivious to his own personal family issues, assigned to `correct' Prot's way of thinking. The groundwork was cast within the first 5 minutes of the film, and my instincts told me &quot;here we go again&quot;. Another looney tune-corrects-a-self absorbed-righteous shrink flick.  It is, but it isn't.Spacey made me BELIEVE from second one, that he was a visitor from K-Pax. I believed he was Prot. I believed Bridges as the tired psych. And as the film progressed, I was rewarded with Spacey's perfectly even character, and Bridges' coming into awareness concerning his own personal shortcomings. I cannot bring myself to expose the whole movie, since I truly want you to experience the absolute smoothness of this film. I can tell you I was blown away by the planetary mathematic scene in the planetarium, where Prot proves the existance of his planet to the only three scientists in the world who could understand the physics-math. I knew then that Prot was real. And I actually clapped my hands and yelled `YES!' at the tv (it did not answer). Prot had PROVED he was an alien visitor. And I believed.There is an almost uncanny parallel to the very underated film `Fisher King' starring Robin Williams(a fantastic performance) and, oh!, Jeff Bridges! Both Williams and Spacey are suspected lunatics,with Bridges as their psych guy. The difference is, in Fisher King, Bridges is actually drawn into Williams' madness, and in K-Pax, Bridges does a superb job of walking the `I Believe' tightrope. Williams played a blatant lunatic who thrives in his alter-world, and Spacey IS from this Universe. In both films, I compliment Bridges (though I am not a real fan) but in Fisher King, the movie is quietly about Bridges. In K-Pax, Spacey is the the absolute heart and soul. I honestly smelled Oscar for Spacey, and he deserveds it. For Bridges, a Best Supporting was NOT unbelievable.And the ending? Oh the ending! The best thing this film did, was give you an ending with a true dicotomy. Is Prot from K-Pax, or is he the poor wretched character Bridges dug up. I am leaving this review vague on purpose. I do not want to taint YOUR interpretation of the ending. I will say this, the alternate ending on The DVD is the better ending.Okay, I will ruin it. Prot, was right. He COULD travel on beams of light. he did go back. K-Pax was real. At least, That's what I believe.If any of you have read my reviews, you know I do not review bad films (except Scary Movie).

586754,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JKIR,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 7]","Prot (Kevin Spacey) appears at a New York train station one afternoon, seemingly on a beam of light. The police quickly take him into custody and he is soon transferred to a mental hospital in Manhattan. Dr. Claudia Villers (Alfre Woodard), the head of the institute, assigns Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) to help Prot. Powell is the type of psychiatrist who cares, really cares, about his patients, so much so that his family life is strained. Prot is the type of patient that instantly wins over all of the other patients and helps them makes changes in their lives. Powell realizes that there he has a limited amount of time to help Prot figure out who he really is, a mystery that will consume his every waking moment.""""K-PAX"" is a great movie, just what our country needs right now"". No wait, that is ""Serendipity"". """"K-PAX"" is a patriotic flag-waver, just what our country needs right now"". No, wait, that is ""The Last Castle"". As the current crop of movies get buried under excessive critic hyperbole relating their relative strengths or merits to the events of September 11, 2001, it is refreshing to see a film like ""K-PAX"" come along. ""K-PAX"" is a completely ordinary film. Directed by Iain Softley, the film is filled with so many psychiatrist-patient clich&eacute;s that it almost becomes good for that reason alone.Kevin Spacey, one of the more gifted actors working today, does a good job with the role. For the first two acts, Spacey is so into the character of Prot, that we begin to believe that he could possibly be an alien. He wears sunglasses throughout most of the film, because Prot is sensitive to the bright light on Earth. This allows Spacey to use his mouth and facial expressions to build subtleties into the character. It makes the character less showy and more believable. For this reason alone, the film earns a lot more respect from me. As the sessions with Powell continue and Powell decides to regress Prot, the Showier-This-Is-My-Shot-At-An-Oscar elements begin to shine through. First of all, I never once believed that Powell had actually hypnotized Prot. It seemed far too easy and far too quick and then when he does, Spacey has a difficult time making this believable. To the credit of Spacey and the filmmakers, they don't take the easy road with this, providing some interest, but these sequences just stop the film dead and remove the viewer from the world it has spent so long trying to create.Bridges, as always, is good, but he really doesn't have a lot to work with. His character is concerned. He wants to help Prot because he is concerned. He want to have Prot visit his home because he is concerned. He flies to .... because he is concerned. It doesn't allow a lot of growth for his character. Powell's final moments, the hang-your-tears-out-to-dry moment, is also extremely predictable.Amazingly, the filmmakers have managed to populate the ward of the hospital with every single character actor who has ever appeared in a film set in a mental ward. Either as a patient or a doctor, they are here. It is a virtual encyclopedia of both actors and clich&eacute;s. Conchata Ferrell plays Betty McAllister, the big, gruff assistant in the ward. Alfre Woodard plays the head of the ward. Ajay Naidu plays an assistant in the ward. Peter Gerety (you may recognize him from the TV series ""Homicide"") plays Sal, the former doorman who thinks everyone stinks, literally. Celia Weston (you may remember her as the actress who replaced Polly Holliday on the television series ""Alice"") plays a patient who thinks she is a matriarch. I am just amazed at the originality on display in ""K-PAX"".Despite all of my criticisms, I am still recommending ""K-PAX"", barely. The first two thirds of Kevin Spacey's performance earn the film enough points to help me disregard the rest of the thoroughly predictable film.

586763,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B00005JKIR,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[1, 1]","I'd like to give this film five stars, but the first 3/4 of it is pretty bad. It drags out all the clich&eacute;s of psychiatric-hospital films -- ""cute"" patients, the desire of the staff to medicate patients into submission, the doctor who insists on treating them as human beings, etc, etc, etc.Then -- as Dr Powell (Jeff Bridges) unravels the mystery of who prot (Kevin Spacey) really is -- the story takes the only turn it could possibly take, and becomes a tragedy. If you were expecting a charming story about a sweetly delusional person, you're not going to get it. ""Harvey"" it ain't.Bridges, a remarkable actor when at his best, isn't here. He doesn't have much to do. This is perhaps fortunate, because the story is partly about how the patient solves the doctor's and patients' problems (yet another clich&eacute;), and there's too much of this as it is. Spacey has the plum role, and delivers a characterization that almost convinces us he's an alien.This is one of those ""worth seeing once"" films. It's recommended on that basis.Addendum: In the novel on which the film is based, prot really is an alien from K-PAX. For me, this undercuts the tragedy at the center of the story. The film's trivial ambiguity (which is easily dismissed) weights the tone in the wrong direction. (Note to Roger Ebert... prot's explanation of the possibility of FTL velocities is correct.)",4,a fantasy that turns into a tragedy,1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,1381,"[""'d"", 'like', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'first', '3/4', 'pretty', 'bad', 'out', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'psychiatric-hospital', 'films', 'cute', 'patients', 'desire', 'staff', 'medicate', 'patients', 'submission', 'doctor', 'who', 'treating', 'human', 'beings', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc.Then', 'Dr', 'Powell', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'mystery', 'who', 'prot', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'really', 'story', 'only', 'turn', 'could', 'possibly', 'take', 'tragedy', 'were', 'expecting', 'charming', 'story', 'sweetly', 'delusional', 'person', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'Harvey', 'remarkable', 'actor', 'when', 'best', ""n't"", 'here', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'perhaps', 'fortunate', 'story', 'partly', 'how', 'patient', 'doctor', 'patients', 'problems', 'yet', 'clich', 'eacute', 'too', 'much', 'Spacey', 'plum', 'role', 'characterization', 'almost', 'convinces', 'alien.This', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', 'films', 'recommended', 'basis.Addendum', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'prot', 'really', 'alien', 'K-PAX', 'tragedy', 'center', 'story', 'film', 'trivial', 'ambiguity', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'tone', 'wrong', 'direction', 'Note', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'prot', 'explanation', 'possibility', 'FTL', 'velocities', 'correct']",N/A

586765,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JKIR,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Every once in awhile, movie fans need to watch a great ""what if?"" movie to really get them thinking about extraordinary possibilities.  ""K-Pax"" is exactly that type of movie.For a basic plot summary, ""K-Pax"" sees Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appear in a train station with seemingly no explanation of how or why.  According to Prot himself, he is an extraterrestrial from the planet K-Pax hear to ""observe and report"" on Earth culture.  Predictably, Prot is placed in a mental institution where Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) begins to unravel the mystery behind the strange (yet oddly inspiring) Prot.This is a great mystery/drama that will keep you engaged from beginning to end.  Director Iain Softley gives the film great pacing and fills it with equal parts human drama, mystery, science fiction, and humor.  If you have a single curious bone in your body, you'll quickly get sucked into the quirky Prot character and just how the heck we might be!A quick fair warning though: this is not necessarily the type of movie where all the ""answers"" are wrapped up in a nice bow for you at the end.  It requires a lot of thought and introspection to truly figure out for yourself what you feel the ""answer"" truly is.  I usually dislike those kind of conclusions, but here the subject matter becomes so compelling and fantastic that it makes sense of different interpretations of the preceding events to creep in.Overall, ""K-Pax"" is a great film for the intellectually curious or those who just love a great human drama mystery.  Only those with a very limited imagination will completely dismiss it.",4,"A Great ""What If?""
