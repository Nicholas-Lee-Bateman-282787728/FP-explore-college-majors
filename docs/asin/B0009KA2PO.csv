907216,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0009KA2PO,Lawyeraau,"[5, 10]","MISS CONGENIALITY  ***This is a moderately entertaining, if forgettable, comedy. It showcases Ms. Bullock's comedic talents, if nothing else. The premise of the film revolves around the need for an FBI agent to go undercover as a contestant during a beauty pageant, due to intelligence reports that indicate that the pageant may be subject to a terrorist attack. Before she knows it, FBI agent Gracie Hart, a tomboyish, klutzy, and nerdy female, who snorts when she laughs, is assigned to the job. A beauty pageant coach, deliciously played by Michael Caine, is assigned to turn our erstwhile beast into a beauty. He succeeds admirably, as he has a lot with which to work.Ms. Bullock plays her role with somewhat ham handed determination. Still, she manages to charm. Her supporting cast, which includes Benjamin Bratt, as her fellow agent and potential love interest, and Candace Bergen and William Shatner, as the pageant hosts, act as comedic foils. The pageant contestants also provide a number of light hearted screen moments. This is a comedy that is easy enough to enjoy, though predictable, as long as one's expectations are not inordinately high.MISS CONGENIALITY 2  ****As a sequel, this film surprisingly succeeds. Sandra Bullock, with her coltish good looks and her spot on comedic timing, successfully reprises the role of Gracie Hart, FBI agent. In fact, I enjoyed this film even more than I did the prequel, where Gracie Hart infiltrated a national beauty pageant as a contestant, her affableness winning her the award for Miss Congeniality.It now appears, however, that Agent Hart's ability to work effectively as an agent has been compromised by the publicity that she received from her entry into that national beauty pageant. Gracie Hart is now instantly recognizable, whenever she hits the streets, by an adoring public who has taken to her as a duck takes to water.This being the case, the powers that be at the FBI decide to make Agent Hart into a poster girl for the FBI, and she is given a mini entourage to polish their diamond in the rough. By the time they get through with her, Agent Hart is as slick and as polished as a cover girl, temporarily losing sight of why she joined the FBI in the first place.Agent Hart is assigned a bodyguard, problem child agent, Sam Fuller (Regina King), who has some serious anger management issues. They get initially get along together like oil and water, with some funny comedic moments between the two. Ultimately, at the eleventh hour, their relationship evolves into one of mutual respect.When Agent Hart's best friend, Miss United States (Heather Burns), is kidnapped in Las Vegas, along with pageant official Stan Fields (William Shatner), Agent Hart remembers why it was that she joined the FBI in the first place. Although she is brought into the case strictly as a media liaison, she desperately wants to be taken seriously as an agent on the case, Unfortunately, her investigative efforts are stymied by the local FBI chief, Agent Collins (Treat Williams), who views her as expendable fluff.While the storyline may be thin, at times, there are enough memorable moments to sustain the film, not least being the excellent comedic performances given by Sandra Bullock and Regina King. It is a professionally successful pairing of two talented actresses with a flair for the comedic. Sandra Bullock proves, once again, that one can be gorgeous and funny. For Regina King, the role of Sam Fuller is a breakout comedic role for her.Moreover, the supporting cast is likewise funny. William Shatner, who of late has proven himself to have a deft comedic touch, provides some wacky moments. It was also great to see Treat Williams, who is as attractive as ever, playing the role of Agent Collins, the tightly controlled, ego driven, local FBI chief who seeks to wrap up the case successfully for his own personal aggrandizement. Elizabeth Rohm, of Law and Order fame, is a pleasant surprise in the small role of Carol Fields, the FBI agent who is two timing her fellow agent boyfriend with their mutual boss.Although the film has some plot holes and may be implausible, at times, it still provides some enjoyable comedic moments. There are also cameo appearances by Regis Philbin and his wife, Joy. While this film may not be everyone's cup of tea, fans of Ms. Bullock will surely enjoy seeing her in this one.
