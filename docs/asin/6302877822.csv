Non-southerners seem to think all southern states are the same so therefore there's no need to distinguish one state from another.

342880,A3CSZJBRVUMRDK,6302877822,"Eric C. Johnson ""chesspride""","[8, 10]","I read the 40+ reviews of this film posted on Amazon...and at times I wondered whether I was watching the same movie as the reviewers.Yes, the film is a bit slow-paced.  I believe this is intentional -- this is a ""talking"" film, not an action film.  The slow-pace emulates the slow-pace of life in the rural South (i.e. no electricity, no indoor plumbing, oppressive heat, hard work, simple life, etc.).  That fact is important to the film.The Billy Joe character -- though conflicted -- is clearly a young gay man.  How do we know?  Several clues are given through-out the film: 1) He talks differently than the other young male characters in the film, 2) He dresses differently, and 3) He pursues his love interest (the young girl) differently.  And see below for another important clue.These subtle clues don't add up to much early on...but combined with the climax of the film...they definitely point to a ""coming out"" moment (rather than some reviews that stated that the Jamboree incident was a one-time event or even something against the Billy Joe character's wishes).Billy Joe is different.  He's conflicted.  The movie is the coming out story of a very confused young man in the rural South.  The film goes to great lengths to show that Billy Joe's desires and intentions are very ordinary and normal...and the viewer goes along with Billy Joe as a likeable character...until the revelation at the end of the film.And the Jamboree footage gives another, vital 4th clue:  Billy Joe is both scared and repulsed by the hooker.  Think about that -- he's been wooing his young friend for half of the film, but when his eyes see the naked woman at the sawmill...his reaction tells the story.  Even given that he is inebriated...his reaction is not one of passion or interest...but fear and even repulsion.  He is not like the other male characters in that scene or in the film.One reviewer said that a scene may have been cut from the Jamboree -- a scene where the Billy Joe character and his boss are laughing or walking away from the camera together.  If this scene exists, it is vital for the continuity of the story....and needs to be added back to the eventual DVD release.And there needs to be a DVD release of this film -- it is a stunningly beautiful time capsule of life in that time in the South.  It is not ""dangerous"" as some reviewers said...and the idea that portraying a young gay man's struggle on film could be dangerous to future viewers is wrong thinking.The film leaves one with sadness that Billy Joe made the wrong choice by jumping off that bridge.  He may have tried to ""make it right"" or get back that doll or go back in time....but the film also makes it clear that Billy Joe knew exactly why he couldn't do that.  And the sad ending of this film can be contrasted with the more hopeful and positive future that young gay men have today in 2011.This film -- like Brokeback Mountain -- is a sad film of unfulfilled lives.  But it is also a very beautiful film....worth watching again and again.",4,Brokeback Mountain of the 1970s,1308528000,"06 20, 2011",2011,3023,"['read', '40+', 'reviews', 'film', 'posted', 'Amazon', 'times', 'wondered', 'was', 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'reviewers.Yes', 'film', 'bit', 'slow-paced', 'believe', 'intentional', 'talking', 'film', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'slow-pace', 'slow-pace', 'life', 'rural', 'South', 'i.e', 'electricity', 'indoor', 'plumbing', 'oppressive', 'heat', 'hard', 'work', 'simple', 'life', 'etc.', 'fact', 'important', 'film.The', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'character', 'conflicted', 'clearly', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'Several', 'clues', 'are', 'given', 'film', '1', 'differently', 'other', 'young', 'male', 'characters', 'film', '2', 'differently', '3', 'love', 'interest', 'young', 'girl', 'differently', 'see', 'important', 'clue.These', 'subtle', 'clues', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'early', 'combined', 'climax', 'film', 'definitely', 'point', 'coming', 'out', 'moment', 'rather', 'reviews', 'stated', 'Jamboree', 'incident', 'was', 'one-time', 'event', 'even', 'something', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'character', 'wishes', '.Billy', 'Joe', 'different', 'conflicted', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'story', 'very', 'confused', 'young', 'man', 'rural', 'South', 'film', 'great', 'lengths', 'show', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'desires', 'intentions', 'are', 'very', 'ordinary', 'normal', 'viewer', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'likeable', 'character', 'revelation', 'end', 'film.And', 'Jamboree', 'footage', 'vital', '4th', 'clue', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'scared', 'repulsed', 'hooker', 'Think', 'been', 'wooing', 'young', 'friend', 'half', 'film', 'when', 'eyes', 'see', 'naked', 'woman', 'sawmill', 'reaction', 'story', 'Even', 'given', 'inebriated', 'reaction', 'not', 'one', 'passion', 'interest', 'fear', 'even', 'repulsion', 'not', 'other', 'male', 'characters', 'scene', 'film.One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'scene', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'Jamboree', 'scene', 'where', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'character', 'boss', 'are', 'laughing', 'walking', 'away', 'camera', 'together', 'scene', 'vital', 'continuity', 'story', '.and', 'needs', 'be', 'added', 'back', 'eventual', 'DVD', 'release.And', 'there', 'be', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'time', 'capsule', 'life', 'time', 'South', 'not', 'dangerous', 'reviewers', 'said', 'idea', 'portraying', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'struggle', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'dangerous', 'future', 'viewers', 'wrong', 'thinking.The', 'film', 'one', 'sadness', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'made', 'wrong', 'choice', 'jumping', 'off', 'bridge', 'may', 'have', 'tried', 'make', 'right', 'get', 'back', 'doll', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'film', 'also', 'clear', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'knew', 'exactly', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'sad', 'ending', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'contrasted', 'more', 'hopeful', 'positive', 'future', 'young', 'gay', 'men', 'have', 'today', '2011.This', 'film', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'sad', 'film', 'unfulfilled', 'lives', 'also', 'very', 'beautiful', 'film', '.worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again']",N/A
342881,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302877822,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[34, 67]","Bobbie Gentry's album ODE TO BILLY JOE knocked The Beatles' SGT. PEPPER off the top of the American music charts in the 1960s, and the title track became a musical touchstone for many of that generation.  It was a ballad, and it offered the story of a rural Mississippi farm girl who goes into the family home for the midday meal--and learns through casual conversation over the kitchen table that Billy Joe McAllister has jumped off the Tallahatchie bridge.  Simply written and performed, Gentry's song had an aura of mysterious tragedy, for clearly there was some unknown relationship between the singer and Billy Joe--and while Gentry implied a great deal, she did not specify details of what that relationship might be, leaving her listeners to wonder and make interpretations of their own.One of the most popular ideas about the song was that Billy Joe was black, and that the &quot;something&quot; he and the singer had been seen throwing off the Tallahatchie bridge was their secretly born infant--and in many respects this interpretation fit the details of the lyrics Gentry wrote.  But Gentry herself left the mystery intact, and although often pressed over the years, she wisely never specified exactly who Billy Joe was, what the relationship had been, what had been throw off the bride--or even if the &quot;something&quot; thrown off the bridge was even relevant.Enter Hollywood.Presumably the powers that be rejected the idea of making Billy Joe black--and there is some justification there, for Gentry never said he was, and if indeed he was black the entire plot of the film would be obvious the instant the character appeared on the screen.  So they came up with a different twist.  In the mid-1970s, Hollywood considered homosexuality to be the dirty secret to end all dirty secrets, and films still generally presented gay characters as desperately unhappy at best.Now, the general idea that Hollywood came up with wasn't in and of itself bad--and if you consider what might have been done with it the possibilities are really intriguing.  But what they did with it in fact was an entirely different matter.  Not only is the plot and script bad, they are so bad that they are downright embarrassing, and whenever the film is mentioned I find myself unable to suppress a reflexive cringe.But there is a tremendous irony here.  When Hollywood wants to a movie about Mississippi, it almost never actually goes to Mississippi; instead, the director goes to Florida, or South Carolina, or Georgia, or just shoots the film on a Los Angeles backlot.  The result, of course, is that it looks like Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, a Los Angeles backlot--anywhere but Mississippi.  But while Max Bear is no great shakes as a director, he actually did film the movie in Mississippi, and what's more he filmed it in and around the old Talliahatchie bridge, so for once they got at least that much right.  And the cast is also quite good, particularly lead Glynnis O'Connor.  So the elements were there: it looked right, the cast was strong, and they had an idea with potential.  But in truth, that just makes the actual result that much more unfortunate.If you're a fan of the song, or if you grew up in Mississippi as I did, you might want to sit through this film once.  But trust me: once will be enough.  And if you don't care about the song and have no interest in seeing what rural Mississippi actually looks like as opposed to what Hollywood thinks it looks like, you need to avoid this one like the plague.--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--",1,What an Embarrassing Bad Film!,1062892800,"09 7, 2003",2003,3551,"['Bobbie', 'Gentry', 'album', 'ODE', 'TO', 'BILLY', 'JOE', 'knocked', 'Beatles', 'SGT', 'PEPPER', 'top', 'American', 'music', 'charts', '1960s', 'title', 'track', 'became', 'musical', 'touchstone', 'many', 'generation', 'was', 'ballad', 'offered', 'story', 'rural', 'Mississippi', 'farm', 'girl', 'who', 'family', 'home', 'midday', 'meal', 'through', 'casual', 'conversation', 'kitchen', 'table', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'McAllister', 'jumped', 'off', 'Tallahatchie', 'bridge', 'Simply', 'written', 'performed', 'Gentry', 'song', 'had', 'aura', 'mysterious', 'tragedy', 'clearly', 'was', 'unknown', 'relationship', 'singer', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'Gentry', 'implied', 'great', 'deal', 'did', 'not', 'specify', 'details', 'what', 'relationship', 'might', 'be', 'leaving', 'listeners', 'wonder', 'make', 'interpretations', 'own.One', 'most', 'popular', 'ideas', 'song', 'was', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'was', 'black', 'quot', 'something', 'quot', 'singer', 'had', 'been', 'seen', 'throwing', 'off', 'Tallahatchie', 'bridge', 'was', 'secretly', 'born', 'infant', 'many', 'respects', 'interpretation', 'details', 'lyrics', 'Gentry', 'wrote', 'Gentry', 'left', 'mystery', 'intact', 'often', 'pressed', 'years', 'wisely', 'never', 'specified', 'exactly', 'who', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'was', 'what', 'relationship', 'had', 'been', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'throw', 'off', 'bride', 'even', 'quot', 'something', 'quot', 'thrown', 'bridge', 'was', 'even', 'relevant.Enter', 'Hollywood.Presumably', 'powers', 'be', 'rejected', 'idea', 'making', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'black', 'justification', 'there', 'Gentry', 'never', 'said', 'was', 'indeed', 'was', 'black', 'entire', 'plot', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'obvious', 'instant', 'character', 'appeared', 'screen', 'came', 'up', 'different', 'twist', 'mid-1970s', 'Hollywood', 'considered', 'homosexuality', 'be', 'dirty', 'secret', 'end', 'dirty', 'secrets', 'films', 'still', 'generally', 'presented', 'gay', 'characters', 'desperately', 'unhappy', 'best.Now', 'general', 'idea', 'Hollywood', 'came', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'consider', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'possibilities', 'are', 'really', 'intriguing', 'what', 'did', 'fact', 'was', 'entirely', 'different', 'matter', 'Not', 'only', 'plot', 'script', 'bad', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'downright', 'embarrassing', 'whenever', 'film', 'mentioned', 'find', 'unable', 'suppress', 'reflexive', 'cringe.But', 'tremendous', 'irony', 'here', 'When', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Mississippi', 'almost', 'never', 'actually', 'Mississippi', 'instead', 'director', 'Florida', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Georgia', 'just', 'shoots', 'film', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'backlot', 'result', 'course', 'Florida', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Georgia', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'backlot', 'anywhere', 'Mississippi', 'Max', 'Bear', 'great', 'shakes', 'director', 'actually', 'did', 'film', 'movie', 'Mississippi', 'what', 'more', 'filmed', 'old', 'Talliahatchie', 'bridge', 'got', 'least', 'much', 'right', 'cast', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'particularly', 'lead', 'Glynnis', ""O'Connor"", 'elements', 'were', 'there', 'looked', 'right', 'cast', 'was', 'strong', 'had', 'idea', 'potential', 'truth', 'just', 'actual', 'result', 'much', 'more', 'unfortunate.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'song', 'grew', 'up', 'Mississippi', 'did', 'might', 'want', 'sit', 'film', 'once', 'once', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'song', 'have', 'interest', 'seeing', 'what', 'rural', 'Mississippi', 'actually', 'as', 'opposed', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'need', 'avoid', 'one', 'plague.', 'GFT', 'Amazon.com', 'Reviewer']",N/A

I disagreed then and I still do.Billy Joe was young, intoxicated, and taken advantage of by an older man.  There was nothing to suggest that he was on the prowl, searching for male partners.  If anything, he was totally in love with and attracted to his girl.The real tragedy of this story was that Billy Joe did not have the maturity or perspective to take a one-time episode for what it was: an isolated incident as opposed to an event that would have or should have changed the course of his life.With sufficient wisdom and insight he would have set his mortification aside and gone on to live a fulfilled life.  This was a single episode and, although it was disturbing, it was not worth ruining and cutting short his life.As for Bobbie Lee, it was not all that plausible that she could have and would have gone off on her own at fifteen, but she sure had a noble reason for doing it.  This was a larger than life response to her situation, but that is often why I watch movies and read novels.This was an especially poignant work of fiction, but it was no guide on how to navigate the disturbing events that sometimes violate and disrupt our lives.For another epic adolescent story by Herman Raucher, see or read Summer of Forty-Two.

It is more than likely, Robbie Benson's most triumphant acting, if the storyline was waaay too controversial even for 1976, at the center of the birth of the LGBT movement. It fed into every negative stereotype about the exploration of a young man's sexual awakening. Based on the basically one hit wonder of the same name by Bobby Gentry (she did have one more Top 5 pop single with ""Fancy"".....but, this became her signature hit). Ironically, it almost prevented my favorite group, Diana Ross and The Supremes, ""Reflections"" from hitting #1. Diana and The Supremes remained contemporary, recording their own version less than a year later on their, ironic again, ""Reflections"" album. (In a further bit of irony, Diana would record an original Robbie Benson composition, ""Nobody Makes Me Crazy Like You Do"" on her 1985 platinum album, ""Swept Away"").Back to the movie, it was a summer release that seemed to take years before it was released on DVD. It is hard to say whether it helped or hurt Benson's career. The movie reportedly registered $50 mil on a very modest $1 mil budget so it was highly profitable.The movie captures the innocence of youth colliding with the bible thumping, judgmental Deep South. It was rightfully the kind of place that if the character, Billy Joe, discovered he was gay.......he would have fled Tupelo, Mississippi on the next, fastest mode of transportation. Glynnis Johns played his love interest with sensitivity and the right mix of naivety. But, of course, the man guilty of deflowering young Billy Joe was portrayed as a lecherous old man, preying on an opportunity. Perhaps, or rather because of that portrayal, it has not been embraced by the LGBT community. (Though I suspect, there are thousands of Robbie Benson gay fans who found enough to vaguely relate to).If you can get passed the deliberately false overtones, there is a beautiful, sensitive portrayal by Robbie Benson (and Glynnis O'Connor). To some, it may not rise above its ""television movie of the week"" saga. At the time, it was extremely difficult to greenlight most scripts with this kind of theme. Who knows if it was the recognition of the hit song that could have been a fading memory in most people's minds. Benson nor O'Connor had no star power at the time, though Max Baer was established in Hollywood from the success of ""The Beverly Hillbillies""....though he was primarily known as an actor, though he may have directed a few episodes of the sitcom. I personally think Robbie Benson deserved an Emmy and/or Golden Globe nomination for his engaging performance. Unfortunately, the outcome of the storyline was and still is, to a lesser degree, today. Organizations like ""Trevor"" offer hope for young gays stuck in remote places like Tallahatchie, MS. with access to the Internet, all a young teen has to do is Google the subject and hundreds of possibilities will be at their disposal.You would like to think in 2013, a young viewer watching this film, would know there are other alternatives. If this happened today, would the young man feel the need to explore his sexuality or would he immediately make himself wrong. I would like to think not. But you never know. There are no undertones indicating that the character could be gay though he hesitated being confronted with a modern day brothel. It would be arresting to even the most sophisticated and informed adult today. Take Amsterdam's Red Light District still causes one to pause......and there are no sex acts going on in those windows like what Benson's character witnessed. Was Baer's intention to make an anti-gay film. That is not so easy to say. Yes, it is polluted with bad cliche's, but, it is important to keep remembering the time and place where Billy Joe McAllister came from. There are factions of the Human Rights Campaign serves this part of Mississippi today. But make no mistake, it is still the rural south, flushed in the Bible Belt.",5,Okay.....it was Every Negative Cliche Possible....but it was Robbie Benson,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,4030,"['was', 'big', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'fan', 'Ode', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'fulfilling', 'promise', 'fan', 'could', 'hope', 'more', 'likely', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'most', 'triumphant', 'acting', 'storyline', 'was', 'waaay', 'too', 'controversial', 'even', '1976', 'center', 'birth', 'LGBT', 'movement', 'fed', 'negative', 'stereotype', 'exploration', 'young', 'man', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'Based', 'basically', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'same', 'name', 'Bobby', 'Gentry', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'Top', '5', 'pop', 'single', 'Fancy', '..but', 'became', 'signature', 'hit', 'Ironically', 'almost', 'prevented', 'favorite', 'group', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Supremes', 'Reflections', 'hitting', '1', 'Diana', 'Supremes', 'remained', 'contemporary', 'recording', 'own', 'version', 'less', 'year', 'later', 'ironic', 'again', 'Reflections', 'album', 'further', 'bit', 'irony', 'Diana', 'would', 'record', 'original', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'composition', 'Nobody', 'Makes', 'Me', 'Crazy', 'Do', '1985', 'platinum', 'album', 'Swept', 'Away', '.Back', 'movie', 'was', 'summer', 'release', 'seemed', 'take', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'hard', 'say', 'helped', 'hurt', 'Benson', 'career', 'movie', 'reportedly', 'registered', '50', 'mil', 'very', 'modest', '1', 'mil', 'budget', 'was', 'highly', 'profitable.The', 'movie', 'innocence', 'youth', 'colliding', 'bible', 'thumping', 'judgmental', 'Deep', 'South', 'was', 'rightfully', 'kind', 'place', 'character', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'discovered', 'was', 'gay', '.he', 'would', 'have', 'fled', 'Tupelo', 'Mississippi', 'next', 'fastest', 'mode', 'transportation', 'Glynnis', 'Johns', 'played', 'love', 'interest', 'sensitivity', 'right', 'mix', 'naivety', 'course', 'man', 'guilty', 'deflowering', 'young', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'was', 'portrayed', 'lecherous', 'old', 'man', 'preying', 'opportunity', 'Perhaps', 'rather', 'portrayal', 'not', 'been', 'embraced', 'LGBT', 'community', 'suspect', 'are', 'thousands', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'gay', 'fans', 'who', 'found', 'enough', 'vaguely', 'relate', 'can', 'get', 'passed', 'deliberately', 'false', 'overtones', 'beautiful', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'Glynnis', ""O'Connor"", 'may', 'not', 'rise', 'television', 'movie', 'week', 'saga', 'time', 'was', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'greenlight', 'most', 'scripts', 'kind', 'theme', 'Who', 'was', 'recognition', 'hit', 'song', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fading', 'memory', 'most', 'people', 'minds', 'Benson', ""O'Connor"", 'had', 'star', 'power', 'time', 'Max', 'Baer', 'was', 'established', 'Hollywood', 'success', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'was', 'primarily', 'known', 'actor', 'may', 'have', 'directed', 'few', 'episodes', 'sitcom', 'personally', 'think', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'and/or', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'engaging', 'performance', 'Unfortunately', 'outcome', 'storyline', 'was', 'still', 'lesser', 'degree', 'today', 'Organizations', 'Trevor', 'offer', 'hope', 'young', 'gays', 'stuck', 'remote', 'places', 'Tallahatchie', 'MS.', 'access', 'Internet', 'young', 'teen', 'do', 'Google', 'subject', 'hundreds', 'possibilities', 'will', 'be', 'disposal.You', 'would', 'like', 'think', '2013', 'young', 'viewer', 'watching', 'film', 'would', 'know', 'are', 'other', 'alternatives', 'happened', 'today', 'would', 'young', 'man', 'feel', 'need', 'explore', 'sexuality', 'would', 'immediately', 'make', 'wrong', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'not', 'never', 'know', 'are', 'undertones', 'indicating', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'gay', 'hesitated', 'being', 'confronted', 'modern', 'day', 'brothel', 'would', 'be', 'arresting', 'even', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'informed', 'adult', 'today', 'Take', 'Amsterdam', 'Red', 'Light', 'District', 'still', 'one', 'pause', 'are', 'sex', 'going', 'windows', 'what', 'Benson', 'character', 'witnessed', 'Was', 'Baer', 'intention', 'make', 'anti-gay', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'say', 'Yes', 'polluted', 'bad', 'cliche', 'important', 'keep', 'remembering', 'time', 'place', 'where', 'Billy', 'Joe', 'McAllister', 'came', 'are', 'factions', 'Human', 'Rights', 'Campaign', 'part', 'Mississippi', 'today', 'make', 'mistake', 'still', 'rural', 'south', 'flushed', 'Bible', 'Belt']",N/A
