1135199,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B0012680BM,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[11, 11]","Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors Volume 1 is another DVD that I won in a recent giveaway. I didn't recognize the name or the cover art. It wasn't until I played the first episode that I finally, more like vaguely, remembered the show, as I was a four-year-old when it aired on television. Actually, I don't recall much about the show, but I do the toys, which were released by Mattel before the show was created. Mattel needed a way to explain the strange looking silver vehicles and the even stranger looking organic/machine vehicles, thus Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors was created. Talented writes such as Larry DiTillio, Barbara Hambly and J. Michael Straczynski, creator of Babylon 5, wrote most the episodes.Here is the series main plot: Audric, a botanist, was experimenting with biotechnology, and developed a crop that could grow in any environment.  A burst of radiation from a solar flare mutated one of his crops, transforming it an evil creature called Saw Boss. The other plants transformed as well and were called the Monster Minds. Audric created a magic root to destroy Saw Boss, but time was not on his side as his laboratory is being attacked. He splits the magical root in half and gives the other half of it to his faithful servant, Oon. He commands Oon to take the root to his son, Jayce, and serve under his command.Oon (a magically animated suit of armor servant) finds Jacye along with Gillian (a wizard/scientist), and Flora, who was created from a flower by Audric. With the help of a Han Solo ripoff character, Herc Stormsailor - a pilot and  mercenary, they become known as the Lightning League. They use their ground vehicles to battle the Monster Minds vehicles, that are grown from vines. The Lightning League travels to planet to planet by the Pride of the Skies II, Herc's space barge, as Jayce searches for his missing father.Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors definitely has that 80s feel to it, along with the catchy pop rock theme song. Obviously, the show had one purpose - sell the toy line. The talented writers took a silly premise and did what they could with it, giving us an original science fiction cartoon. Now thanks to Cookie Jar, a division of Mill Creek Entertainment, old fans can watch the series again and introduce the Lightning League to a new generation. Despite each episode being similar (searching for Jayce's father on a new planet, Saw Boss and his minions show up, and they battle it out with their vehicles. Sadly, the series never got a conclusion as it was cancelled before a movie could go into production. I enjoyed revisiting Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, and I can't wait for Volume 2 to be released.",5,A Classic!,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2666,"['Jayce', 'Wheeled', 'Warriors', 'Volume', '1', 'DVD', 'won', 'recent', 'giveaway', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'name', 'cover', 'art', 'was', ""n't"", 'played', 'first', 'episode', 'finally', 'more', 'vaguely', 'remembered', 'show', 'was', 'four-year-old', 'when', 'aired', 'television', 'Actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'much', 'show', 'do', 'toys', 'were', 'released', 'Mattel', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'Mattel', 'needed', 'way', 'explain', 'strange', 'looking', 'silver', 'vehicles', 'even', 'stranger', 'looking', 'organic/machine', 'vehicles', 'thus', 'Jayce', 'Wheeled', 'Warriors', 'was', 'created', 'Talented', 'writes', 'such', 'Larry', 'DiTillio', 'Barbara', 'Hambly', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'creator', 'Babylon', '5', 'wrote', 'most', 'episodes.Here', 'series', 'main', 'plot', 'Audric', 'botanist', 'was', 'experimenting', 'biotechnology', 'developed', 'crop', 'could', 'grow', 'environment', 'burst', 'radiation', 'solar', 'flare', 'mutated', 'one', 'crops', 'transforming', 'evil', 'creature', 'called', 'Saw', 'Boss', 'other', 'plants', 'transformed', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'called', 'Monster', 'Minds', 'Audric', 'created', 'magic', 'root', 'destroy', 'Saw', 'Boss', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'side', 'laboratory', 'being', 'attacked', 'magical', 'root', 'half', 'other', 'half', 'faithful', 'servant', 'Oon', 'Oon', 'take', 'root', 'son', 'Jayce', 'serve', 'command.Oon', 'magically', 'animated', 'suit', 'armor', 'servant', 'Jacye', 'Gillian', 'wizard/scientist', 'Flora', 'who', 'was', 'created', 'flower', 'Audric', 'help', 'Han', 'Solo', 'ripoff', 'character', 'Herc', 'Stormsailor', 'pilot', 'mercenary', 'become', 'known', 'Lightning', 'League', 'use', 'ground', 'vehicles', 'battle', 'Monster', 'Minds', 'vehicles', 'are', 'grown', 'vines', 'Lightning', 'League', 'travels', 'planet', 'planet', 'Pride', 'Skies', 'II', 'Herc', 'space', 'barge', 'Jayce', 'searches', 'missing', 'father.Jayce', 'Wheeled', 'Warriors', 'definitely', '80s', 'feel', 'catchy', 'pop', 'rock', 'theme', 'song', 'Obviously', 'show', 'had', 'one', 'purpose', 'sell', 'toy', 'line', 'talented', 'writers', 'took', 'silly', 'premise', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'giving', 'original', 'science', 'fiction', 'cartoon', 'Now', 'Cookie', 'Jar', 'division', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'old', 'fans', 'can', 'watch', 'series', 'again', 'introduce', 'Lightning', 'League', 'new', 'generation', 'episode', 'being', 'similar', 'searching', 'Jayce', 'father', 'new', 'planet', 'Saw', 'Boss', 'minions', 'show', 'up', 'battle', 'vehicles', 'Sadly', 'series', 'never', 'got', 'conclusion', 'was', 'cancelled', 'movie', 'could', 'go', 'production', 'enjoyed', 'revisiting', 'Jayce', 'Wheeled', 'Warriors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Volume', '2', 'be', 'released']","Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, Vol. 1"

1135205,A8MZ011X8JDDV,B0012680BM,J. Blaine,"[25, 26]","""Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors"" was one of my favorite 80s animated series. It's right up there with ""ThunderCats"" -- that good! But ""Jayce"" was rather overlooked compared to the likes of ""ThunderCats"", ""He-Man"", ""She-Ra"", ""Voltron"" and many other good animated series of that decadent decade.""Jayce"" has very good storytelling for starters: the basic premise is about a scientist named Audric (Jayce's father) who nearly succeded with ending starvation and hunger in vast star systems with the creation of genetically-engineered vegetation. Out of the blue, a cosmic explosion occurs and causes Audric's creations to wildly mutate into creatures with evil brains (called Monster Minds). Audric had to flee his laboratory with one half of a magical relic called ""The Root"" (Jayce somehow has the other half) that, when fused, would revert the evil creations and their machinations back to harmless vegetation. Jayce, with the help of an old and wise wizard named Gillian, an empathic girl named Flora, and an intergalactic traveling merchant named Herc Stormsailor, sets out to search for his father before the Monster Minds take over the universe. And I can't forget Jayce's little companion, a robot squire named Oon who believes his lance is ""magic"" (which adds a degree of cuteness to what is otherwise dramatic and thrilling stories).""Jayce"" was among J. Michael Strasyncski's (""of ""Babylon 5"" fame) first major efforts at sci-fi storytelling and was also co-producer of this series. It also has great music by Shuki Levy and Haim Saban (some of the most talented musicians for animated fare), and is pretty nicely animated by DIC (the creators of ""M.A.S.K."", ""Inspector Gadget"" and ""Where On Earth is Carmen Sandiego?).I think ""Jayce"" is a timeless series and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially if you are a fan of 80s toons, or any 80s TV program for that matter.",5,The Best 80s Toon You've NEVER Heard Of...,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,1870,"['Jayce', 'Wheeled', 'Warriors', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', '80s', 'animated', 'series', 'right', 'there', 'ThunderCats', 'good', 'Jayce', 'was', 'rather', 'overlooked', 'compared', 'likes', 'ThunderCats', 'He-Man', 'She-Ra', 'Voltron', 'many', 'other', 'good', 'animated', 'series', 'decadent', 'decade', 'Jayce', 'very', 'good', 'storytelling', 'starters', 'basic', 'premise', 'scientist', 'named', 'Audric', 'Jayce', 'father', 'who', 'nearly', 'succeded', 'ending', 'starvation', 'hunger', 'vast', 'star', 'systems', 'creation', 'genetically-engineered', 'vegetation', 'blue', 'cosmic', 'explosion', 'occurs', 'Audric', 'creations', 'wildly', 'mutate', 'creatures', 'evil', 'brains', 'called', 'Monster', 'Minds', 'Audric', 'had', 'flee', 'laboratory', 'one', 'half', 'magical', 'relic', 'called', 'Root', 'Jayce', 'somehow', 'other', 'half', 'when', 'fused', 'would', 'revert', 'evil', 'creations', 'machinations', 'back', 'harmless', 'vegetation', 'Jayce', 'help', 'old', 'wise', 'wizard', 'named', 'Gillian', 'empathic', 'girl', 'named', 'Flora', 'intergalactic', 'traveling', 'merchant', 'named', 'Herc', 'Stormsailor', 'out', 'search', 'father', 'Monster', 'Minds', 'take', 'over', 'universe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Jayce', 'little', 'companion', 'robot', 'squire', 'named', 'Oon', 'who', 'lance', 'magic', 'degree', 'cuteness', 'what', 'otherwise', 'dramatic', 'thrilling', 'stories', 'Jayce', 'was', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Strasyncski', 'Babylon', '5', 'fame', 'first', 'major', 'efforts', 'sci-fi', 'storytelling', 'was', 'also', 'co-producer', 'series', 'also', 'great', 'music', 'Shuki', 'Levy', 'Haim', 'Saban', 'most', 'talented', 'musicians', 'animated', 'fare', 'pretty', 'nicely', 'animated', 'DIC', 'creators', 'M.A.S.K', 'Inspector', 'Gadget', 'Where', 'Earth', 'Carmen', 'Sandiego', 'think', 'Jayce', 'timeless', 'series', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', '80s', 'toons', '80s', 'TV', 'program', 'matter']","Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, Vol. 1"

Now finally we get to see the whole first season with all the characters we remembered in the 80's.  I remember this being my favorite cartoon on TV at that time and aside from Transformers, nothing else mattered.  Jayce is a Luke Skywalker rip-off but who cares?  His unique land vehicle command is what makes him unigue.  In additon to the Thundercats, this is the other animation DVD I have been waiting to purchase.  Herc the Jerc is the likable character as in Han Solo clone, yet he is awesome as a horseback rider and has some other qualities Han Solo didn't. Odviously, Herc was voiced by a guy experienced in D.J. radio or a sports caster as his voice is that quality. Jayce's side-kick Oone is a miniture cavalier who is annoying more than funny.  Flora is a young plant/human girl hybrid and the fish named Broc, is even weirder.  The wizard utilises magic and science in equal measure proving they are one(as in ether I suppose).

1135210,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B0012680BM,Michael Valdivielso,"[1, 1]","Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors has a very simple plot.  Father accidently ends up making a race of EVIL half-plant half-machines.  Father escapes with half a magical root, giving the other half to his son.  Now his son, with the rest of the Lightning League who, must find it, to combine the two halves and SAVE the universe.  If they can find the Father.  Who is also being chased by the EVIL plant-car-creatures.  The EVIL plant-machines call themselves Monster Minds, which seems kind of a give away, and their leader is the EVIL Saw Boss.  EVIL!  Oops, lets move on.The whole cartoon, like most cartoons, was made to sell something.  In this case action figures with fighting Road Warrior kind of cars that fought alien Road Warrior kind of cars.  Think cars with saws, guns, lasers and arms.  While there is little to no character development and the story never gets past the quest phase, my young mind at the time just enjoyed the combat and, for the time, the advanced artwork.  This is an American, kind of, cartoon yet the designs and artwork has the feel of an Japanese anime.Magic, science fiction, rogue pilots, pirates, bounty hunters, and robotic cars.  This had everything my young heart wanted.  Herc Stormsailor is the character I liked the most - he is Hans Solo in cartoon form.  Once he even responded to a insult by saying - Who are you calling scruffy?  He loved money, his space barge Pride of the Skies II was always in need of repair, and he has a interesting background which is slowly revealed during the show.  Seems he worked on BOTH sides of the law and knows some people in high places.The music is great and the battles were fun.  Some of the episodes, like Ghostship seem to have been thoughtfully plotted out, others were just shot-them-ups, bang-bang, which was great for a kid.  Yet Steel Against Shadow, by J. Michael Straczynski, had a very heavy hand when dealing with the Good vs. EVIL theme, with little or no action.  In other words - BOO!  LAME!  More explosions!  Who wants themes and thoughtfully stuff - more mindless firing of weapons into the massed ranks of the EVIL enemy!This set is the first part of the series and I plan to look for volume 2 when it comes out.  Many of my memories seem to be from the latter episodes and I hope to enjoy them too!Good for small kids or adults who like to watch cartoons with lots of explosions, lasers, war machines while eating pizza and thinking of high school.

The people who were involved with making it wanted to make the best show they could with the material they had, and it shows. Yeah, it's cheesy but it's some awesome velveeta. The story is about the titular Jayce, he of the skunky hairdo on the cover there. His father is superscientist Audric (also skunky haired so that you can easily see the family resemblance) and Audric's specialty is botany. Some time in the past that is never mentioned on this show, Jayce lost his mother, so Audric made Jayce a little sister out of plants; the little redhaired girl Flora that you see on the cover. Flora can talk to plants and has a giant floating pet fish because: reasons. Audric also has a robot squire assistant named Oon because, why not? Oon is the comic relief in most episodes. As the show starts, Jayce is kind of petulant because Audric never has time to spend with him, but he better step up because Audric just accidentally made the Monster Minds, so things are about to get real. So, Audric accidentally makes sentient plants bent on world domination while trying to find a cure for hunger. It's kind of funny how quickly he decides they are evil, but I guess anyone would be alarmed if their plants suddenly started growing out of control. Audric hares off to find the other half of a magic root that will stop the Monster Minds that he accidentally unleashed on an unsuspecting galaxy. He leaves Jayce and Flora in the care of  his mentor, a wizard scientist named Gillian. Gillian is a character in the mold of Gandalf and Dumbledore. Why there are wizards in space is never explored, but Gillian tells Jayce he needs to guard his half of the magic root and use the Ring of Light to save as many people as he can from Monster Minds while they try to catch up to Audric. They enlist the help of a space pirate named Herc Stormsailer to ferry them around on this errand. Herc is in the mold of Han Solo. I did always like Herc's ship, the Pride of the Skies II. It looks like a galley ship except the sails are solar panels. Every time Jayce and his group encounter Monster Minds, they wind up in a fight using armored vehicles that they store in the ship's hold when not in use. The armored vehicles were the toys that this whole cartoon was built around. I think you can see why the toys didn't sell as well as the company had hoped. They show up in every episode, but there's a whole lot of stuff going on that has nothing to do with them. The cartoon lives on as TV junk food of the highest order. This first group of episodes sets up the premise and is not the best that were ever produced. The show gets a lot better as it goes on.",5,Nostalgic Fun,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,2855,"['Anybody', 'remember', 'USA', 'Cartoon', 'Express', 'Man', 'loved', 'programming', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'point', 'time', 'Considering', 'was', 'cobbled', 'together', 'sell', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'making', 'wanted', 'make', 'best', 'show', 'could', 'material', 'had', 'Yeah', 'cheesy', 'awesome', 'velveeta', 'story', 'titular', 'Jayce', 'skunky', 'hairdo', 'cover', 'there', 'father', 'superscientist', 'Audric', 'also', 'skunky', 'haired', 'so', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'family', 'resemblance', 'Audric', 'specialty', 'botany', 'time', 'past', 'never', 'mentioned', 'show', 'Jayce', 'lost', 'mother', 'Audric', 'made', 'Jayce', 'little', 'sister', 'plants', 'little', 'redhaired', 'girl', 'Flora', 'see', 'cover', 'Flora', 'can', 'talk', 'plants', 'giant', 'floating', 'pet', 'fish', 'reasons', 'Audric', 'also', 'robot', 'squire', 'assistant', 'named', 'Oon', 'why', 'not', 'Oon', 'comic', 'relief', 'most', 'episodes', 'show', 'Jayce', 'kind', 'petulant', 'Audric', 'never', 'time', 'spend', 'better', 'step', 'up', 'Audric', 'just', 'accidentally', 'made', 'Monster', 'Minds', 'things', 'are', 'get', 'real', 'So', 'Audric', 'accidentally', 'sentient', 'plants', 'bent', 'world', 'domination', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'hunger', 'kind', 'funny', 'how', 'quickly', 'are', 'evil', 'guess', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'alarmed', 'plants', 'suddenly', 'started', 'growing', 'control', 'Audric', 'find', 'other', 'half', 'magic', 'root', 'will', 'stop', 'Monster', 'Minds', 'accidentally', 'unleashed', 'unsuspecting', 'galaxy', 'Jayce', 'Flora', 'care', 'mentor', 'wizard', 'scientist', 'named', 'Gillian', 'Gillian', 'character', 'mold', 'Gandalf', 'Dumbledore', 'Why', 'are', 'wizards', 'space', 'never', 'explored', 'Gillian', 'Jayce', 'guard', 'half', 'magic', 'root', 'use', 'Ring', 'Light', 'save', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'Monster', 'Minds', 'try', 'catch', 'up', 'Audric', 'enlist', 'help', 'space', 'pirate', 'named', 'Herc', 'Stormsailer', 'ferry', 'around', 'errand', 'Herc', 'mold', 'Han', 'Solo', 'did', 'always', 'Herc', 'ship', 'Pride', 'Skies', 'II', 'galley', 'ship', 'sails', 'are', 'solar', 'panels', 'time', 'Jayce', 'group', 'encounter', 'Monster', 'Minds', 'wind', 'up', 'fight', 'using', 'armored', 'vehicles', 'store', 'ship', 'hold', 'when', 'not', 'use', 'armored', 'vehicles', 'were', 'toys', 'whole', 'cartoon', 'was', 'built', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'toys', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'as', 'well', 'company', 'had', 'hoped', 'show', 'up', 'episode', 'whole', 'lot', 'stuff', 'going', 'nothing', 'do', 'cartoon', 'TV', 'junk', 'food', 'highest', 'order', 'first', 'group', 'episodes', 'sets', 'up', 'premise', 'not', 'best', 'were', 'ever', 'produced', 'show', 'lot', 'better']","Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, Vol. 1"

Today's cartoon openings are just blah. But with the openings of 80s cartoons, you got a great punch that really hyped you up for the show. The episodes, for the most part, are pretty decent quality. There have been only a couple of episodes that were a little washed out. But it's not because of compression. This show is almost 30 years old. Still, the show is a lot of fun, though the story can get a bit boring and repetitive at times. The disc are in little paper sleeves tucked in the box.

1135216,A2WHZM2P2R88FQ,B0012680BM,Takahashii,"[2, 13]","Jayce and the Wheeled warriors was a very nice series which featured good animation combined with a good sound track. The unfortunate part however is that it was setup with a long, long loong run in mind. And that didn't happen because quite frankly; the show was aired right amongst other high qualified animation series (right in the time when anime started its rise, it even left some influenced on Jayce and his gang) which  made the public very unforgiving when it came to something which started to look like a never ending story really quick.And unfortunatly thats what happened here. This series has never reached an end, the original is 65 episodes and thats it. Personally I think that when you lived this period you (should) have realized as much yourself. So this box? If you want to grab as much of the original series to relive it then this is a good buy. If you only want some ""Wheeled warriors action"" I suggest you grab the previous intro release. That features a good collection of episodes to make you relive the good times without any extras. I think thats the best approach because simply put: there isn't much extra available anyway. This series never came to an end; it was originally setup to be a VERY long lasting series hoping for a VERY long lasting toys sale. That didn't happen since most fans saw right through it.And there you have it.. Good entertainment but don't expect much more.
