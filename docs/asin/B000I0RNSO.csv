1017895,A26MVLLMLG3Q8B,B000I0RNSO,"Avid Reader ""Karen""","[0, 0]","This is a great upper and lower body workout. I started working out with Gilad on Fit TV, so I decided to give some of his DVDs a chance. This work out does not disappoint. Gilad is motivating, but not annoying. I like that he uses both bands and weights in this workout. I have changed the workout sometimes and use weights where he uses the bands to mix it up.I would compare this work out's intensity to my boot camp class where we do resistance training. This DVD does not contain any ab or core work which is designed to get you to buy the Core and More DVD, but I would still highly recommend getting this workout. My only complaint with this DVD is that the warm up at 15 minutes is too long. I have found other uses for this warm up - I will use it to warm up before doing Pilates and/or yoga.",5,Great Upper and Lower Body Workout!,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,801,"['great', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'workout', 'started', 'working', 'out', 'Gilad', 'Fit', 'TV', 'decided', 'give', 'DVDs', 'chance', 'work', 'out', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Gilad', 'motivating', 'not', 'annoying', 'like', 'bands', 'weights', 'workout', 'have', 'changed', 'workout', 'sometimes', 'use', 'weights', 'where', 'bands', 'mix', 'would', 'compare', 'work', 'out', 'intensity', 'boot', 'camp', 'class', 'where', 'do', 'resistance', 'training', 'DVD', 'not', 'contain', 'ab', 'core', 'work', 'designed', 'get', 'buy', 'Core', 'More', 'DVD', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'workout', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'warm', 'up', '15', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'have', 'found', 'other', 'uses', 'warm', 'will', 'use', 'warm', 'up', 'doing', 'Pilates', 'yoga']",Gilad's Ultimate Body Sculpt Series - Cuts and Curves

1017897,A34N8HS9ZJRZN8,B000I0RNSO,christmasgirl,"[2, 2]",This is a good workout that always makes me feel a bit sore the next day.  It focuses on the upper body with some leg exercises in the warmup and less focus on the core.  I like this DVD because it is not too hard and not too easy.  Other workout DVDs that I have bought can be really difficult and then I dread doing them and ultimately avoid using them.  Gilad's DVD's are not like that.  He exudes a positive attitude and is encouraging without being annoying like other fitness personalities.,4,Good overall,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,496,"['good', 'workout', 'always', 'feel', 'bit', 'next', 'day', 'upper', 'body', 'leg', 'warmup', 'less', 'focus', 'core', 'DVD', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'not', 'too', 'easy', 'Other', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'have', 'bought', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'difficult', 'then', 'dread', 'doing', 'ultimately', 'avoid', 'using', 'Gilad', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'positive', 'attitude', 'encouraging', 'being', 'annoying', 'other', 'fitness', 'personalities']",Gilad's Ultimate Body Sculpt Series - Cuts and Curves

1017899,AR5RYQBKKC1UT,B000I0RNSO,Kelly A. Daly,"[63, 64]","This DVD consists of a warm-up, 39 minutes of toning for upper body and lower body and a 6 minute stretch.  In the first half of the toning you'll alternate between upper body and lower body doing squats and lunges for the legs and concentrating on the shoulders, biceps, and triceps for the upper body. Gilad and his class use an x-ertube (a resistance band with handles).  He says you can use your own body weight or dumbells but doesn't have anyone showing that modification and he really should have.The second half of the workout is mostly upper body working shoulders, biceps ,triceps, back and chest using 2 sets of weights.  Towards the end there's a short segment working calves with upper body.  The workout ends with push-ups and chest flies.  As usual, Gilad is motivating and provides many form pointers.  My only complaint is that you can't select the resistance band and weights sections separately.  You can individually select the warm-up, entire sculpting section and the cool down.  Overall, I loved the beach setting and thought the exercises were very effective",4,Good Intermediate Body Sculpting Workout,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,1082,"['DVD', 'warm-up', '39', 'minutes', 'toning', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'body', '6', 'minute', 'stretch', 'first', 'half', 'toning', ""'ll"", 'alternate', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'body', 'doing', 'squats', 'lunges', 'legs', 'concentrating', 'shoulders', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'upper', 'body', 'Gilad', 'class', 'use', 'x-ertube', 'resistance', 'band', 'handles', 'can', 'use', 'own', 'body', 'weight', 'dumbells', ""n't"", 'have', 'anyone', 'showing', 'modification', 'really', 'should', 'have.The', 'second', 'half', 'workout', 'mostly', 'upper', 'body', 'working', 'shoulders', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'back', 'chest', 'using', '2', 'sets', 'weights', 'end', 'short', 'segment', 'working', 'calves', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'push-ups', 'chest', 'flies', 'usual', 'Gilad', 'motivating', 'many', 'form', 'pointers', 'only', 'complaint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'select', 'resistance', 'band', 'weights', 'sections', 'separately', 'can', 'individually', 'select', 'warm-up', 'entire', 'sculpting', 'section', 'cool', 'down', 'Overall', 'loved', 'beach', 'setting', 'thought', 'exercises', 'were', 'very', 'effective']",Gilad's Ultimate Body Sculpt Series - Cuts and Curves
