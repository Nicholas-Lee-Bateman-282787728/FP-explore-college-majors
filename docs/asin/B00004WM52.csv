If you're interested in Ouija boards, then you'll like this film.  Even if you aren't interested in Ouija boards, this film is interesting and scary but not too scary.  It has some great scenes, including the loan shark being killed by the pins in his butterfly collection and a demon in the Ouija board taking control of a man's body and taking over his life.  I'm glad this movie is on DVD now.  I have the video already, but nothing beats a DVD for a clear, crisp picture.  This is a good picture for a good price.",5,Great Horror Film,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,628,"['Okay', ""n't"", '34', 'Exorcist', '34', '34', 'Omen', '34', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'just', 'same', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Ouija', 'boards', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'Ouija', 'boards', 'film', 'interesting', 'scary', 'not', 'too', 'scary', 'great', 'scenes', 'including', 'loan', 'shark', 'being', 'killed', 'pins', 'butterfly', 'collection', 'demon', 'Ouija', 'board', 'taking', 'control', 'man', 'body', 'taking', 'over', 'life', ""'m"", 'glad', 'movie', 'DVD', 'now', 'have', 'video', 'already', 'nothing', 'DVD', 'clear', 'crisp', 'picture', 'good', 'picture', 'good', 'price']",N/A

A demonic spirit possesses him in order to bang his wife and make a demon child.Some of the dialogue is corny but for what it is (a low budget horror)it wasn't bad.

555895,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B00004WM52,Sid the Elf,"[2, 5]","As you may know the super Sid brothers have quite the affinity for horror/action from the child hood age of the 90's. Even when the flick looks like a real trash bag we still feel it our civil duty to give it a try in hopes of expanding our B library. When Netflix suggested we check out Witchboard III we though...why not? Sure it's the third installment and have no clue what the other two were about, but that's the beauty watching B as opposed to legitimate theater. You'll be so baffled no matter how well you know the others it won't matter the order you watch them in. They key that grabbed us in Witchboard III was the fact that the main actor was best known for playing a guy named Albert in Canadian cream cheese commercials. Seriously the only thing more B then that is if he did commercials for BRRRR ice tea back in 95.After fortune and fame as the Canadian king of cream cheese Albert changed his named to Brian and become an out of work stockbroker. Now instead of living the unemployed life of B, chuck, and snacks he decides to be a big baby about it. While his wife goes off to bring home the bacon Brian hangs out with the creepy landlord Mr. Redman. Once Mr. Redman cracks out the ouija board it's turbo time from there on out. Brian winds up becoming obsessed with the board and eventually possessed by a demon that tries to nail his wife. See if Brian would have just done unemployment right like Sid he would have never gotten himself into this mess. Well we also wouldn't have this B to watch so guess we're glad it all played out like this.Witchboard III was a nice entry into the library of 90's B horror. Obviously it wasn't a movie that will mess you up for the rest of your life, HEY BABY!, but it will give you the right amount of laughs and poor acting to do the trick. Any fan of horror from this decade knows where it's going since just about every plot is the same. They just switch up a few concepts and actors, but overall it's all the same entertainment. But we just can't get enough of it and never will. So if you're looking for some cheap laughs and sub par horror, the Witchboard III should do the trick. It's about as fun as pegging Santa with stuff while he sleeps.",4,"It was so hot in here last night, I could have swore I saw the devil sitting in the living room",1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,2208,"['may', 'know', 'super', 'Sid', 'brothers', 'have', 'quite', 'affinity', 'horror/action', 'child', 'hood', 'age', '90', 'Even', 'when', 'flick', 'real', 'trash', 'bag', 'still', 'feel', 'civil', 'duty', 'give', 'try', 'hopes', 'expanding', 'B', 'library', 'When', 'Netflix', 'suggested', 'check', 'out', 'Witchboard', 'III', 'though', 'why', 'not', 'Sure', 'third', 'installment', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'other', 'two', 'were', 'about', 'beauty', 'watching', 'B', 'opposed', 'legitimate', 'theater', ""'ll"", 'be', 'so', 'baffled', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'know', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'order', 'watch', 'key', 'grabbed', 'Witchboard', 'III', 'was', 'fact', 'main', 'actor', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'guy', 'named', 'Albert', 'Canadian', 'cream', 'cheese', 'commercials', 'Seriously', 'only', 'thing', 'more', 'B', 'then', 'did', 'commercials', 'BRRRR', 'ice', 'tea', 'back', '95.After', 'fortune', 'fame', 'Canadian', 'king', 'cream', 'cheese', 'Albert', 'changed', 'named', 'Brian', 'become', 'out', 'work', 'stockbroker', 'Now', 'instead', 'living', 'unemployed', 'life', 'B', 'chuck', 'snacks', 'be', 'big', 'baby', 'wife', 'bring', 'home', 'bacon', 'Brian', 'out', 'creepy', 'Mr.', 'Redman', 'Once', 'Mr.', 'Redman', 'out', 'ouija', 'board', 'turbo', 'time', 'there', 'out', 'Brian', 'up', 'becoming', 'obsessed', 'board', 'eventually', 'possessed', 'demon', 'nail', 'wife', 'See', 'Brian', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'done', 'unemployment', 'right', 'Sid', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'gotten', 'mess', 'Well', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'B', 'watch', 'so', 'guess', ""'re"", 'glad', 'played', 'out', 'this.Witchboard', 'III', 'was', 'nice', 'entry', 'library', '90', 'B', 'horror', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'will', 'mess', 'up', 'rest', 'life', 'HEY', 'BABY', 'will', 'give', 'right', 'amount', 'laughs', 'poor', 'acting', 'do', 'trick', 'fan', 'horror', 'decade', 'where', 'going', 'just', 'plot', 'same', 'just', 'switch', 'up', 'few', 'concepts', 'actors', 'overall', 'same', 'entertainment', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'never', 'will', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'sub', 'par', 'horror', 'Witchboard', 'III', 'should', 'do', 'trick', 'as', 'fun', 'pegging', 'Santa', 'stuff']",N/A
