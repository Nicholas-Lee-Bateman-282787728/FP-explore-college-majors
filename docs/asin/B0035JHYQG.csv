However, they are having one last laugh as the get there. Everyone in this show is hilarious and you do not need to be older to enjoy it.  The two main characters definitely hold it together with the woman being the acidic of the two and the man being the soothing balm.  These are two terrific comedy partners and the supporting characters are all well picked, in all generations.  Nothing like this exists in American tv so it is especially a treat for American viewers like myself. Watch every season of it.

The Bayview Retirement Home for the Almost Dead is once more the setting for the on-going activities of Tom Ballard and Diana Trent.As I have stated in the other reviews of this series, ""WAITING FOR GOD"" was done on an overall story arc.  We've had the beginning, the middle, and now here comes the end!  But what a build-up to the most hilarious climax a series ever had!  Those who thought they had seen 'everything' with the way the Newhart series ended have not seen ANYTHING yet.  The first time I saw the last episode (after almost killing my ribcage laughing) I was a bit saddened to realize that there were no more.  However they ended on what can only be called a 'high point.' The series finale is priceless!Thankfully, the missing Christmas special included at the end of Season Four solved the continuity problem of how we lost Basil Makepeace (played by the late Michael Bilton) and acquired Jane's grandfather Jamie.  Mr. Bilton passed away and they brought in the new character to keep the balance.  That episode (Diana directing a Christmas pagent?) was never shown in the US to my knowledge.In this, the completion of the story line, the action continues.  Highlights (I give no details - why spoil the fun?)include: health problems, breakups, breakdowns, fights with city hall, Jane decides to become a nun (again), Harvey becomes a clergyman, and Tom decides that he and Diana should marry.  The series finale has to be the funniest 25 minutes of television, even surpassing ""Scandal"" (the infamous 'bedroom episode in the third season of this series).  It's could be called 'two weddigs and a funeral' but someone else had that title first.  No matter.  It's great fun, and worth the LONG wait.NOTE:  FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T 'VISITED' BAYVIEW, START AT THE BEGINNING WITH SEASON ONE.  PLEASE DON'T START WITH SEASON FIVE!  The story won't make as much sense if you jump in at the middle, and if you see the end before the beginning, you are cheating yourself out of the joy of watching the characters get to know one another!I have my set on pre-order. When I saw it was available, I heaved a sigh of relief that we will own the whole series.  They will be put in a place of honour. We wore out the video tapes a long time ago.  These are the shows you can watch over & over.  We certainly do - and we STILL laugh out loud!",5,Back to Bayview:  The FINAL SEASON is Here!,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,2376,"['Let', 'antics', 'aging', 'continue', 'Bayview', 'Retirement', 'Home', 'Almost', 'Dead', 'once', 'more', 'setting', 'on-going', 'activities', 'Tom', 'Ballard', 'Diana', 'Trent.As', 'have', 'stated', 'other', 'reviews', 'series', 'WAITING', 'FOR', 'GOD', 'was', 'done', 'overall', 'story', 'arc', ""'ve"", 'had', 'beginning', 'middle', 'now', 'here', 'end', 'what', 'build-up', 'most', 'hilarious', 'climax', 'series', 'ever', 'had', 'who', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', ""'everything"", 'way', 'Newhart', 'series', 'ended', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'ANYTHING', 'yet', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'last', 'episode', 'almost', 'killing', 'ribcage', 'laughing', 'was', 'bit', 'saddened', 'realize', 'were', 'more', 'However', 'ended', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', ""'high"", 'point', 'series', 'finale', 'priceless', 'Thankfully', 'missing', 'Christmas', 'special', 'included', 'end', 'Season', 'Four', 'solved', 'continuity', 'problem', 'how', 'lost', 'Basil', 'Makepeace', 'played', 'late', 'Michael', 'Bilton', 'acquired', 'Jane', 'grandfather', 'Jamie', 'Mr.', 'Bilton', 'passed', 'away', 'brought', 'new', 'character', 'keep', 'balance', 'episode', 'Diana', 'directing', 'Christmas', 'pagent', 'was', 'never', 'shown', 'US', 'knowledge.In', 'completion', 'story', 'line', 'action', 'Highlights', 'give', 'details', 'why', 'spoil', 'fun', 'include', 'health', 'problems', 'breakups', 'breakdowns', 'fights', 'city', 'hall', 'Jane', 'become', 'nun', 'again', 'Harvey', 'clergyman', 'Tom', 'Diana', 'should', 'marry', 'series', 'finale', 'be', 'funniest', '25', 'minutes', 'television', 'even', 'surpassing', 'Scandal', 'infamous', ""'bedroom"", 'episode', 'third', 'season', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'called', ""'two"", 'weddigs', 'funeral', 'someone', 'else', 'had', 'title', 'first', 'matter', 'great', 'fun', 'LONG', 'wait.NOTE', 'FOR', 'THOSE', 'WHO', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", ""'VISITED"", 'BAYVIEW', 'START', 'AT', 'THE', 'BEGINNING', 'WITH', 'SEASON', 'ONE', 'PLEASE', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'START', 'WITH', 'SEASON', 'FIVE', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'jump', 'middle', 'see', 'end', 'beginning', 'are', 'cheating', 'joy', 'watching', 'characters', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'have', 'set', 'pre-order', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'available', 'heaved', 'sigh', 'relief', 'will', 'own', 'whole', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'place', 'honour', 'wore', 'out', 'video', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'are', 'shows', 'can', 'watch', 'certainly', 'do', 'STILL', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud']",N/A

Finally a show not about young people doing stupid physical comedy with near profane inferential &#34;jokes&#34; including ridiculous &#34;political correctness.&#34;Tom and Diana, in the first series (season in the US) meet when they are involuntarily retired by England's retirement system to Bayview, an apartment complex for the elderly. As Diana says, a home for the &#34;nearly dead.&#34;Harvey and Jane, the duo who run the place are romantic, comic opposites while they try to oust Tom and Diana who see the &#34;economical&#34; way the older people are treated. In this last segment, marriage is at hand - but you have to see it for yourself! (No spoiler!)England's often soft-spoken humour doesn't find too much of a place here.

I have loved living all 5 seasons with them and sharing their geriatric ailments and their schemes to keep from being ""managed"". All you kids (under 60) should definitely buy the whole series, watch it now, and watch it again at intervals. The older you get the harder you will laugh at it even as you go through the physical pains and weirdies of aging with Diana and Tom and all the other denizens of Bayview. Five seasons was exactly the right timing for the series -- long enough to develop the characters and situation but not too long for it to get tedious.I love Diana and I've always said I want to be her when I grow up. Curmudgeons have the most fun and Diana certainly demonstrates that, with Tom as her perfect backup. But don't ever misjudge or underestimate Tom -- he has his own strength and is never overshadowed by Diana. Other characters, all colorful and some crazy, revolve around Tom and Diana and get involved in their causes and wars against the Bayview management. The actors who portray them are some of the best you'll see anywhere.Although I rate the entire series with 5 stars, I almost held back a star on Season 5: there were several things I thought did not work as well as they should have. Jeffrey's temporary transformation into a biker was overdone; Harvey's short stint as a ""minister"" was unnecessary and silly; and a new character, Jane's grandfather. although pleasant, didn't really add that much to the season. But all of our friends were in their usual rare form and the ending!....this has to be the funniest finale in all of TV-land! Yes, there is a wedding, but you have never been to a wedding like this one!So goodbye, Diana, Tom, Harvey, Jane and all the rest -- you can go on forever on our DVDs and we will enjoy coming back to visit you as we age too, and need plenty of laughs to see us through that most peculiar part of our lives.",5,Old Age and Treachery Will Always Overcome Youth and Skill,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,1941,"['80-year-old', ""'m"", 'prejudiced', 'know', 'people', 'have', 'loved', 'living', '5', 'seasons', 'sharing', 'geriatric', 'ailments', 'schemes', 'keep', 'being', 'managed', 'kids', '60', 'should', 'definitely', 'buy', 'whole', 'series', 'watch', 'now', 'watch', 'again', 'intervals', 'older', 'get', 'harder', 'will', 'laugh', 'even', 'go', 'physical', 'pains', 'weirdies', 'aging', 'Diana', 'Tom', 'other', 'denizens', 'Bayview', 'Five', 'seasons', 'was', 'exactly', 'right', 'timing', 'series', 'long', 'enough', 'develop', 'characters', 'situation', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'tedious.I', 'love', 'Diana', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'want', 'be', 'when', 'grow', 'up', 'Curmudgeons', 'have', 'most', 'fun', 'Diana', 'certainly', 'Tom', 'perfect', 'backup', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'misjudge', 'underestimate', 'Tom', 'own', 'strength', 'never', 'overshadowed', 'Diana', 'Other', 'characters', 'colorful', 'crazy', 'revolve', 'Tom', 'Diana', 'get', 'involved', 'causes', 'wars', 'Bayview', 'management', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'are', 'best', ""'ll"", 'see', 'rate', 'entire', 'series', '5', 'stars', 'almost', 'held', 'back', 'star', 'Season', '5', 'were', 'several', 'things', 'thought', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'Jeffrey', 'temporary', 'transformation', 'biker', 'was', 'overdone', 'Harvey', 'short', 'stint', 'minister', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'silly', 'new', 'character', 'Jane', 'grandfather', 'pleasant', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'that', 'much', 'season', 'friends', 'were', 'usual', 'rare', 'form', 'ending', 'be', 'funniest', 'finale', 'TV-land', 'Yes', 'wedding', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'wedding', 'one', 'So', 'goodbye', 'Diana', 'Tom', 'Harvey', 'Jane', 'rest', 'can', 'go', 'forever', 'DVDs', 'will', 'enjoy', 'coming', 'back', 'visit', 'age', 'too', 'need', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'see', 'most', 'peculiar', 'part', 'lives']",N/A
