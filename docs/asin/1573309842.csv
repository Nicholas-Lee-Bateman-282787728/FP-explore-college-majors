188769,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,1573309842,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[4, 4]","Of all the exercise gurus, the most effective is Kathy Smith.  An expert for many years,  her level of excellence increases.  What she has incorporated into this 1990, 85-minute program is approximately 15 minute warmup.  That's 15 minutes folks, a first half and 2nd half of warmup!  That warmup includes a workout with small hand weights, toning the muscles with the warmup.What she does stress is a 30 minute calorie burning aerobics that is broken down into four progressive segments to challenge all levels.  Two segments are labeled Aerobics I, then you have Aerobics II, III, IV.  The latter is high intensity.  After a full 30 minutes of aerobics, she concentrates on the legs, focusing on lunges with small hand weights.Her message is simple, the longer you work out aerobically, you build your endurance and reach your maximum fat burning potential.  And her reason for incorporating muscle tonining is ""stronger muscles will boost your metabolism and help burn even more calories.""  says Smith.  She offers an 8 minute nutritional segment ""power foods"" that enhance your lifestyle.If you are in shape, you can easily follow this 85 minute tape.  What I have always liked about Kathy Smith workouts are the non-complicated steps, except when she gets into a little salsa.  But with a little more practice, a seasoned fitness person can master this.  This is what makes Kathy Smith's exercises doable.The Weight Loss Workout tape is refreshing.  The attractive settings change with each warm-up and aerobic segment as her class attire is colorful.  It is clear where each segment begins and ends.  I find the music inviting and very acceptable.  If you want a good full aerobic workout with muscle toning, I strongly urge you to get this tape!  It is excellent.....MzRizz.",5,"Refreshing workout that consists of all levels, Excellent",1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,1781,"['exercise', 'gurus', 'most', 'effective', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'expert', 'many', 'years', 'level', 'excellence', 'increases', 'What', 'incorporated', '1990', '85-minute', 'program', 'approximately', '15', 'minute', 'warmup', '15', 'minutes', 'folks', 'first', 'half', '2nd', 'half', 'warmup', 'workout', 'small', 'hand', 'weights', 'toning', 'muscles', 'warmup.What', 'stress', '30', 'minute', 'calorie', 'burning', 'aerobics', 'broken', 'down', 'four', 'progressive', 'segments', 'challenge', 'levels', 'Two', 'segments', 'are', 'labeled', 'Aerobics', 'then', 'have', 'Aerobics', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'latter', 'high', 'intensity', 'full', '30', 'minutes', 'aerobics', 'legs', 'focusing', 'lunges', 'small', 'hand', 'weights.Her', 'message', 'simple', 'longer', 'work', 'out', 'aerobically', 'build', 'endurance', 'reach', 'maximum', 'fat', 'burning', 'potential', 'reason', 'incorporating', 'muscle', 'tonining', 'stronger', 'muscles', 'will', 'boost', 'metabolism', 'help', 'burn', 'even', 'more', 'calories', 'Smith', '8', 'minute', 'nutritional', 'segment', 'power', 'foods', 'enhance', 'lifestyle.If', 'are', 'shape', 'can', 'easily', 'follow', '85', 'minute', 'tape', 'What', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'workouts', 'are', 'non-complicated', 'steps', 'when', 'little', 'salsa', 'little', 'more', 'practice', 'seasoned', 'fitness', 'person', 'can', 'master', 'what', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'exercises', 'doable.The', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Workout', 'tape', 'refreshing', 'attractive', 'settings', 'change', 'warm-up', 'aerobic', 'segment', 'class', 'attire', 'colorful', 'clear', 'where', 'segment', 'find', 'music', 'inviting', 'very', 'acceptable', 'want', 'good', 'full', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'muscle', 'toning', 'strongly', 'urge', 'get', 'tape', 'excellent', '..MzRizz']",N/A

The only problem I have with a lot of Kathy Smith tapes is that she doesn't pay much attention to isolating the inner thigh. Other than that, this is a non stop hard workout.

I personally think the entire workout is very effective! It's a complete workout and it works!Kathy Smith's Weight Loss Workout completely gave me a new approach to fitness. I started this workout about two months after I had my daughter and the variations of the intensity, style mixed with weights, really made me sweat and changed my whole aspect about working out with weights, because they REALLY help burn fat. The different sections in this tape really made working out fun and challenging. I lost 30 pounds in 4 months, with proper eating of course. She explains how she just had a baby and I was like NO WAY because she looked great,until I followed this workout along with her nutrition advice at the end that teaches you how to eat healthy and cut calories in a simple manner. Well it's possible because I have toned arms and legs, and went from 155 lbs. at 5ft6 to 122lbs.

188772,A1NDGQH0D61NYB,1573309842,chicago mom,"[2, 3]","I'm looking for a good cardio workout and unfortunately it's not an easy task.  This is my first workout video from Kathy Smith.  It's not a bad workout.  The pace can be very fast, I couldn't keep up with how quickly she was going back and forth at one point.  I guess you could qualify me as intermediate, but there were times where I had to stop and figure out what she was doing.  It can be a little annoying when they edit shots of Kathy just smiling into the camera or the goofing off or the messups.  The pause between segments is also a little confusing too as it just stops and you wait a good two-five seconds.  I also was not a fan of the 50s workout, it seemed more silly than anything.Having said all that, I did sweat with the first two aerobic segments.  So while this wasn't one of my favorite workouts, I'm sure I'll use it now and again.  Maybe once I do it more, I'll start to like it better.  It's happened before.  I could also do without the segment with the weights in the beginning as I'd rather do just all cardio.So ultimately, if you're looking for a cardio workout, this just might fit the bill.  But keep in mind that Kathy can be a little confusing at times, I would imagine especially so for a beginner.  Plus she goes a little too fast.  But you do work up a sweat.",3,"Not a bad workout, but not the best......",1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,1297,"[""'m"", 'looking', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'first', 'workout', 'video', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'not', 'bad', 'workout', 'pace', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'fast', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'how', 'quickly', 'was', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'one', 'point', 'guess', 'could', 'qualify', 'intermediate', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'had', 'stop', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'annoying', 'when', 'edit', 'shots', 'Kathy', 'just', 'smiling', 'camera', 'goofing', 'off', 'messups', 'pause', 'segments', 'also', 'little', 'confusing', 'too', 'just', 'stops', 'wait', 'good', 'two-five', 'seconds', 'also', 'was', 'not', 'fan', '50s', 'workout', 'seemed', 'more', 'silly', 'anything.Having', 'said', 'did', 'sweat', 'first', 'two', 'aerobic', 'segments', 'So', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'favorite', 'workouts', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'use', 'now', 'again', 'Maybe', 'once', 'do', 'more', ""'ll"", 'start', 'like', 'better', 'happened', 'could', 'also', 'do', 'segment', 'weights', 'beginning', ""'d"", 'rather', 'do', 'just', 'cardio.So', 'ultimately', ""'re"", 'looking', 'cardio', 'workout', 'just', 'might', 'fit', 'bill', 'keep', 'mind', 'Kathy', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'confusing', 'times', 'would', 'imagine', 'especially', 'so', 'beginner', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'do', 'work', 'up', 'sweat']",N/A

188774,A5T9Q2N229FH2,1573309842,JANMC,"[9, 9]","This is one of my favorite work-out tapes of all time. I have worked out with tapes for many many years and have done The Firm, Taebo, Kathy Ireland, Buns of Steel and many others as well as really old Jane Fonda tapes.I like this work-out because for some reason it seems to go by very fast and I NEVER get bored of it. And this is also one of the few tapes where I still love the music even after 100 times of listening to it. This is a long work-out - an hour total, but the different segments in different settings and the fun moves make the time fly. I am one of those people who gets on the treadmill and suddenly 10 minutes seem to last forever because of the repetitive motion. In this work-out, it will be 40 minutes through and I would have barely noticed.This work-out was filmed shortly after Kathy had a baby and she looks great. If you do it as recommended (about 5 times a week) you WILL lose weight as promised in the title. (Note: you will probably not lose a whole lot if you pig out on pizza every day - no work-out will do that for you). BUT what is guaranteed regardless of your nutrition is that you will feel stronger! Your muscles will start having definition. Your cardio-vascular fitness will soar. You will feel great!There are times in this work-out when cueing is not perfect and when Kathy stumbles in giving accurate instruction. Do not let this bother you. The first few times you may not be able to keep up with the fast pace and the move changes but this will be a blessing later when you have done the work-out many times and the quick move changes are what keep it fun for you. You almost start to feel like you are part of a well choreographed dance routine.  That said, this is not about dancing - great muscle toning and conditioning is cleverly disguised in many fun moves. There is no getting down on the floor - but you will work every part of your body while keeping the heart rate up and burning those calories.Kathy is motivational and looks and acts like she is having the time of her life. Somehow its hard not to follow her with a smile on your face and have a great time as well.This work-out can be done without weights but weights are very recommended, especially as you become stronger. A 3 pound dumbell set gives great results!For an even better overall toning work-out on days you are serious about working those muscles I would recommend alternating this tape with the original FIRM series. This workout is fun and keeps your heart pumping the entire 60 minutes. The FIRM tapes will take your muscle conditioning to a new level.On a final note, this tape is great for an intermediate to advanced  level of fitness BUT you can also use it as a beginner for maximal weight loss results and do it without weights and walk in place when you can't keep up. You can even do the first 30 minutes and forward to the cool down. Very quickly you will be amazed at how you start keeping up and are soon able to finish the entire work-out.Overall a great work-out! Unless you can't stand Kathy Smith for some reason, I highly recommend getting it. It is one of her best!",5,One of the best!,1024444800,"06 19, 2002",2002,3114,"['one', 'favorite', 'work-out', 'tapes', 'time', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'tapes', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'done', 'Firm', 'Taebo', 'Kathy', 'Ireland', 'Buns', 'Steel', 'many', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'old', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'tapes.I', 'work-out', 'reason', 'go', 'very', 'fast', 'NEVER', 'get', 'bored', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'tapes', 'where', 'still', 'love', 'music', 'even', '100', 'times', 'listening', 'long', 'work-out', 'hour', 'total', 'different', 'segments', 'different', 'settings', 'fun', 'moves', 'make', 'time', 'fly', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'treadmill', 'suddenly', '10', 'minutes', 'seem', 'last', 'forever', 'repetitive', 'motion', 'work-out', 'will', 'be', '40', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'barely', 'noticed.This', 'work-out', 'was', 'filmed', 'shortly', 'Kathy', 'had', 'baby', 'great', 'do', 'recommended', '5', 'times', 'week', 'WILL', 'lose', 'weight', 'promised', 'title', 'Note', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'lose', 'whole', 'lot', 'pig', 'out', 'pizza', 'day', 'work-out', 'will', 'do', 'BUT', 'what', 'guaranteed', 'regardless', 'nutrition', 'will', 'feel', 'stronger', 'muscles', 'will', 'start', 'having', 'definition', 'cardio-vascular', 'fitness', 'will', 'soar', 'will', 'feel', 'great', 'are', 'times', 'work-out', 'when', 'cueing', 'not', 'perfect', 'when', 'Kathy', 'giving', 'accurate', 'instruction', 'Do', 'not', 'let', 'bother', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'fast', 'pace', 'move', 'changes', 'will', 'be', 'blessing', 'later', 'when', 'have', 'done', 'work-out', 'many', 'times', 'quick', 'move', 'changes', 'are', 'what', 'keep', 'fun', 'almost', 'start', 'feel', 'are', 'part', 'well', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'routine', 'said', 'not', 'dancing', 'great', 'muscle', 'toning', 'conditioning', 'cleverly', 'disguised', 'many', 'fun', 'moves', 'getting', 'down', 'floor', 'will', 'work', 'part', 'body', 'keeping', 'heart', 'rate', 'burning', 'calories.Kathy', 'motivational', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'Somehow', 'hard', 'not', 'follow', 'smile', 'face', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'well.This', 'work-out', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'weights', 'weights', 'are', 'very', 'recommended', 'especially', 'become', 'stronger', '3', 'pound', 'dumbell', 'set', 'great', 'results', 'even', 'better', 'overall', 'toning', 'work-out', 'days', 'are', 'serious', 'working', 'muscles', 'would', 'recommend', 'alternating', 'tape', 'original', 'FIRM', 'series', 'workout', 'fun', 'heart', 'pumping', 'entire', '60', 'minutes', 'FIRM', 'tapes', 'will', 'take', 'muscle', 'conditioning', 'new', 'level.On', 'final', 'note', 'tape', 'great', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'level', 'fitness', 'BUT', 'can', 'also', 'use', 'beginner', 'maximal', 'weight', 'loss', 'results', 'do', 'weights', 'walk', 'place', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'can', 'even', 'do', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'forward', 'cool', 'down', 'Very', 'quickly', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'start', 'keeping', 'up', 'are', 'soon', 'able', 'finish', 'entire', 'work-out.Overall', 'great', 'work-out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'reason', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'one', 'best']",N/A

So now I see it as an entertaining break & by the way, those editing embellishments are only done in a few segments, not beginning to end.Now, as for the workout itself, I have to say that it definitely works. I work out a LOT & have long since reached a plateau in weight loss, even with running, step aerobics, other videos & tennis, but adding this video I began to see a few extra pounds & inches come off, probably thanks to the length (1 hr) & the toning.

After a good warm-up, you should be going right into the cardio, not stopping for arm weight training THEN starting cardio, hence my relief for the DVD options for cardio only, then weight training only. Good solid workout. A good option also for beginners. This is an older workout so the outfits are from the 80's and some of the music is hokey.

188779,A3N0HBW8IP8CZQ,1573309842,"Melissa P. Cooper ""kymissyin""","[79, 81]","Fitness level: Intermediate.  Composition: 5 minute warm-up; 8 minutes arm and upper body toning; 35 minutes floor aerobics; 8 minutes lower body toning; 5 minute cool-down  Equipment: one-to-five-pound dumbbells; can do toning without weights if you're just starting out.  Heart Rate Checks: 2  Music: ranges from funk to traditional aerobic-style to Caribbean to 50's rock  Impact: Mixed, but low-impact modifiers shown for most routines  Choreography: moderate  Settings: gym and studio. The settings and decor change with each section. Whenever the music changes, you'll see the song title, and section (warm-up, toning, aerobics, cool-down) displayed in the lower left hand corner of the screen, like MTV.She produced this tape after giving birth to her first child and filming her Pregnancy Workout, and some may think it shows its age, but it still is one of the most solid workouts on the market for intermediates and those new to weight work.  Kathy Smith opens with her usual low-key but friendly, informative introduction that belies the energetic routine ahead. I don't know if this is the program that got her looking so great after her pregnancy, but she definitely looks wonderful in this video. Kathy has always advertised this as the follow-up to her Fat Burning Workout video. It's definitely on the next level--steps that are &quot;aerobic&quot; in that video are &quot;warm-ups&quot; here, and the first few times I did this workout I was grateful for the nutritional lecture at the end. Not because I needed it--although I probably did--but because all I could do after completing the cool-down was lie on the floor and pant!However, I persevered and I'm glad I did. I felt results in a few weeks, and saw them in the second month. At the risk of sounding like a FIRM testimonial, I looked better at age 37 than I had at 21! My arms and upper body were toned for the first time in my life. By the fourth month, I had tons of energy, and I looked great in my jeans. Then came pregnancy, and it wasn't until my daughter was weaned that I could once again exercise this intensely. When I returned to intermediate level, it was  good to have this tape in my collection.This was the first time I'd ever used weights in an aerobic routine--maybe some wouldn't rate the weight work for &quot;Weight Loss Workout&quot; as &quot;aerobic&quot; but it sure kept my heart rate in the target zone--especially the lower body work. Kathy suggests that neophytes do the tape the first time without weights--and one exerciser demonstrates the toning that way. (Another exerciser has wristband weights--the rest use dumbbells) I ignored her and started with 1-pound weights, and had no problems.Two things I loved about the toning: it was &quot;choreographed&quot; so you keep moving instead of sitting or, Heaven forbid, lying on the floor. (At my 9:00pm exercise time, a prone position is an invitation to slumber!) Arms and upper body work follows the warm-up; the lower body work follows the aerobics. If they'd been lumped together, I'd have just skipped them and done only the aerobics, which to me is always the fun part. Also, when I was new to using weights like this, I don't think I could have done all 16 minutes consecutively--the division gave me a chance to get my second wind, which usually happens 20 minutes into the aerobics section. That reminds me. . .I haven't said much about the aerobics yet--which is why I bought the tape in the first place. I love aerobics the way a dog loves bones. Enjoyable routines and great music are part of what I live for, and this program has both. It's a faster pace and a little trickier than her beginner workouts, but Kathy is a master at teaching through &quot;add-ons&quot; and combinations. She also includes modifiers for people who are intermediate level but don't want to do &quot;power moves.&quot; I especially enjoy the Caribbean and 50's segments--the crew has *almost* as much fun as the one in &quot;Donna-Mite Workout.&quot;The only problem I have with this workout is that the toning is wonderful, but doesn't include work for abs and back. Kathy implies in her intro that she geared this video in part toward new mothers. But she left out exercises for their most common trouble spots! Had she included them, this would be the perfect routine for intermediates, in my book. But since I now rotate videos rather than stick with just one, I can include that work on a &quot;strength day&quot; instead. Or I can supplement on the same day with one of the FIRM's &quot;More 5-Day Abs&quot; routine. It's a good tape nonetheless, that fell just a little short of being great.",4,"An oldie but still a goodie, as they used to say:)",992649600,"06 16, 2001",2001,4645,"['Fitness', 'level', 'Intermediate', 'Composition', '5', 'minute', 'warm-up', '8', 'minutes', 'arm', 'upper', 'body', 'toning', '35', 'minutes', 'floor', 'aerobics', '8', 'minutes', 'lower', 'body', 'toning', '5', 'minute', 'cool-down', 'Equipment', 'one-to-five-pound', 'dumbbells', 'can', 'do', 'toning', 'weights', ""'re"", 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'Heart', 'Rate', 'Checks', '2', 'Music', 'ranges', 'funk', 'traditional', 'aerobic-style', 'Caribbean', '50', 'rock', 'Impact', 'Mixed', 'low-impact', 'modifiers', 'shown', 'most', 'routines', 'Choreography', 'moderate', 'Settings', 'gym', 'studio', 'settings', 'decor', 'change', 'section', 'music', 'changes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'song', 'title', 'section', 'warm-up', 'toning', 'aerobics', 'cool-down', 'displayed', 'lower', 'left', 'hand', 'corner', 'screen', 'MTV.She', 'produced', 'tape', 'giving', 'birth', 'first', 'child', 'filming', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'may', 'think', 'age', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'solid', 'workouts', 'market', 'intermediates', 'new', 'weight', 'work', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'usual', 'low-key', 'friendly', 'informative', 'introduction', 'energetic', 'routine', 'ahead', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'program', 'got', 'looking', 'so', 'great', 'pregnancy', 'definitely', 'wonderful', 'video', 'Kathy', 'always', 'advertised', 'follow-up', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Workout', 'video', 'definitely', 'next', 'level', 'steps', 'are', 'quot', 'aerobic', 'quot', 'video', 'are', 'quot', 'warm-ups', 'quot', 'here', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'did', 'workout', 'was', 'grateful', 'nutritional', 'lecture', 'end', 'Not', 'needed', 'probably', 'did', 'could', 'do', 'completing', 'cool-down', 'was', 'lie', 'floor', 'pant', 'However', 'persevered', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'felt', 'results', 'few', 'weeks', 'saw', 'second', 'month', 'risk', 'sounding', 'FIRM', 'testimonial', 'looked', 'better', 'age', '37', 'had', '21', 'arms', 'upper', 'body', 'were', 'toned', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'fourth', 'month', 'had', 'tons', 'energy', 'looked', 'great', 'jeans', 'Then', 'came', 'pregnancy', 'was', ""n't"", 'daughter', 'was', 'weaned', 'could', 'once', 'again', 'exercise', 'intensely', 'When', 'returned', 'intermediate', 'level', 'was', 'good', 'have', 'tape', 'collection.This', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'ever', 'used', 'weights', 'aerobic', 'routine', 'maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'rate', 'weight', 'work', 'quot', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Workout', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'sure', 'kept', 'heart', 'rate', 'target', 'zone', 'especially', 'lower', 'body', 'work', 'Kathy', 'neophytes', 'do', 'tape', 'first', 'time', 'weights', 'one', 'exerciser', 'toning', 'way', 'exerciser', 'wristband', 'weights', 'rest', 'use', 'dumbbells', 'ignored', 'started', '1-pound', 'weights', 'had', 'problems.Two', 'things', 'loved', 'toning', 'was', 'quot', 'choreographed', 'quot', 'keep', 'moving', 'instead', 'sitting', 'Heaven', 'forbid', 'lying', 'floor', '9:00pm', 'exercise', 'time', 'prone', 'position', 'invitation', 'slumber', 'Arms', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'warm-up', 'lower', 'body', 'work', 'aerobics', ""'d"", 'been', 'lumped', 'together', ""'d"", 'have', 'just', 'skipped', 'done', 'only', 'aerobics', 'always', 'fun', 'part', 'Also', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'using', 'weights', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', '16', 'minutes', 'consecutively', 'division', 'gave', 'chance', 'get', 'second', 'wind', 'usually', '20', 'minutes', 'aerobics', 'section', '.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'said', 'much', 'aerobics', 'yet', 'why', 'bought', 'tape', 'first', 'place', 'love', 'aerobics', 'way', 'dog', 'bones', 'Enjoyable', 'routines', 'great', 'music', 'are', 'part', 'what', 'live', 'program', 'faster', 'pace', 'little', 'trickier', 'beginner', 'workouts', 'Kathy', 'master', 'teaching', 'quot', 'add-ons', 'quot', 'combinations', 'also', 'modifiers', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'intermediate', 'level', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'quot', 'power', 'moves.', 'quot', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'Caribbean', '50', 'segments', 'crew', '*almost*', 'much', 'fun', 'one', 'quot', 'Donna-Mite', 'Workout.', 'quot', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'workout', 'toning', 'wonderful', ""n't"", 'include', 'work', 'abs', 'back', 'Kathy', 'intro', 'geared', 'video', 'part', 'new', 'mothers', 'left', 'out', 'exercises', 'most', 'common', 'trouble', 'spots', 'Had', 'included', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'routine', 'intermediates', 'book', 'now', 'rotate', 'videos', 'rather', 'stick', 'just', 'one', 'can', 'include', 'work', 'quot', 'strength', 'day', 'quot', 'instead', 'can', 'supplement', 'same', 'day', 'one', 'FIRM', 'quot', 'More', '5-Day', 'Abs', 'quot', 'routine', 'good', 'tape', 'nonetheless', 'fell', 'just', 'little', 'short', 'being', 'great']",N/A

But the covers leads you to believe that this is an recent workout when it's not.  I was rather dissappointed to see the big hair, Kathy flipping her hair, cheesy set ups, older music and outdated aerobic moves.I do believe that it is a good workout if you can get past these drawbacks.  I kept thinking to myself that hopefully the next segment would be more updated but that never happened.  I was amazed at the fast pace of the workout though.  The workout switches between one set that looks like a warehouse or a loft apartment and the other set is very bright and cheesy looking.  After some sections, the DVD instructs you to take your pulse and it has a clock on the screen to time yourself.  It also provides the proper heart rate for your age.There is a great warm up in this DVD and it's the best that I have come across to date.  It really warms you up and doesn't rush you through it.  Then you do a weight warm up and then several aerobic routines, switching between the two sets.  There is also a lunge section that I absolutely hate doing because it's so fast paced and it's hard to keep up with them.  Every now and then they will show a Kathy blooper and then immediately it flashes back to the workout.  There is also a 50's section and I now realize why I wasn't born in the 50's since I can't seem to get the moves down.  In the end there is a standing leg section, standing legs section with weights and then cool down.Overall, it gives you a great workout if you can get past the big hair and cheesy set up.  I have now used this workout several times and am still learning the moves.  I have lost 87 pounds and still have 17 more pounds to lose.
