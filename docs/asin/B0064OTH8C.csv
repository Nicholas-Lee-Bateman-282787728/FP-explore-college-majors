So we are so happy that we ordered this movie.. This was so good! We own several of David E Talbert's other plays which we love..So now we really can not wait until we receive this play in the mail as we want to watch this over again. The plot was so awesome and so was the singing and acting.. We could not get enough of this play..Well if you don't purchase this one, you will miss out.. This play was made and performed with such excellence.Waiting on our's in the mail!******Update******12/21/2011Whew we have watched this play over so many times! That I had to come back and make an update... We are so enjoying the quality of this play. I love the message, the acting, the scenes and as far as the singing goes, I can not complain. I think Michelle Williams did as well as she was going to do. Maybe acting is more of her talent (All I know is that the song make me your number one, I would love to have that song on an album with Michelle Williams as the artist of the song. That song was so awesome and she did an excellence job!).Over all, if you miss this play just because of the singing, you will miss out on the message, and the talent of David E Talbert. This will make a great gift, I wish that I would have ordered more.. But now I have a great gift idea, along with a great movie night for couples and just a girls movie night.The emotions in this play are so reality, and I love the way that this play delivers the wisdom of the elders... Whew! This play even has some suspense in it and twist and flips.... The humor is also great.. For some good family entertainment, you can not ask for more.. I did not want the play to end!We support this play and will continue to support his work..The behind the scenes bonus features is also awesome and worth viewing. For me this play was and is reality... How often do you see beautiful African American couples successful and playing roles that are not full of violence... And as far as Moody... Whew bring it on... Keep Moody in the plays, We would love to see him and this whole cast in a sequel or just another subject matter with this very talented cast. Ann Nesby.. Whew....... How can anyone say anything negative about this play with all this great talent! Keep up the excellence that you so bring in all of your plays!We now have all of his books and all of his plays except for the ones that have not been released. Keep up the great work and thanks for providing good family entertainment! Keep them coming!Just in time for the holidays or anytime! So happy we placed this order! So much talent! Watch this with your husband and watch the forgiveness, temptation, strife, lessons, the time not spent at home, and the redemption, the storms of relationships.. this is reality... look at the divorce rate in the African American community we marry less but have the highest divorce rate.. (something to think about).....The grass is not greener on the other side... as it has to be mowed and trimmed just as well and it also is dormant during seasons and it withers, so if you want some powerful lessons, great music... This is for you! i mean the music has Brent Jones how could you not like what Brent Jones puts out...and many more music talents!This play is great food for thought, I would love to see this as a movie!Now back to more watching over and over, roll on the floor laughs, and inspiration!Enjoy! We sure are.. Sing Ann Nesby! Michelle Williams! Amen Clifton Powell! Whew!********6/9/2012****updateWe are still watching this and it is still funny, roll on the floor laughs, and entertaining! We have shared this play with our family and they love it as well.. We can not wait on the soundtrack to this play to come out!Moody is still funny even several months later from when we first saw this play..If you have not purchased this play, you are missing out.Back to more great singing, humor and a beautiful stage set and great acting!",5,A must have!,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,4058,"['just', 'watched', 'bet', 'wow', 'just', 'also', 'placed', 'order', 'movie', 'earlier', 'today', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'bet', 'today', 'are', 'so', 'happy', 'ordered', 'movie..', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'own', 'several', 'David', 'E', 'Talbert', 'other', 'plays', 'love..So', 'now', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'receive', 'play', 'mail', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'awesome', 'so', 'was', 'singing', 'acting..', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'play..Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'one', 'will', 'miss', 'out..', 'play', 'was', 'made', 'performed', 'such', 'excellence.Waiting', 'mail', '******Update******12/21/2011Whew', 'have', 'watched', 'play', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'make', 'update', 'are', 'so', 'enjoying', 'quality', 'play', 'love', 'message', 'acting', 'scenes', 'as', 'far', 'singing', 'can', 'not', 'complain', 'think', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'Maybe', 'acting', 'more', 'talent', 'know', 'song', 'make', 'number', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'song', 'album', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'artist', 'song', 'song', 'was', 'so', 'awesome', 'did', 'excellence', 'job', 'miss', 'play', 'just', 'singing', 'will', 'miss', 'out', 'message', 'talent', 'David', 'E', 'Talbert', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'gift', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'ordered', 'more..', 'now', 'have', 'great', 'gift', 'idea', 'great', 'movie', 'night', 'couples', 'just', 'girls', 'movie', 'night.The', 'emotions', 'play', 'are', 'so', 'reality', 'love', 'way', 'play', 'wisdom', 'elders', 'Whew', 'play', 'even', 'suspense', 'twist', 'flips', 'humor', 'also', 'great..', 'good', 'family', 'entertainment', 'can', 'not', 'ask', 'more..', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'play', 'end', 'support', 'play', 'will', 'continue', 'support', 'work..The', 'scenes', 'bonus', 'features', 'also', 'awesome', 'worth', 'viewing', 'play', 'was', 'reality', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'beautiful', 'African', 'American', 'couples', 'successful', 'playing', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'full', 'violence', 'as', 'far', 'Moody', 'Whew', 'bring', 'Keep', 'Moody', 'plays', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'whole', 'cast', 'sequel', 'just', 'subject', 'matter', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'Ann', 'Nesby..', 'Whew', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'say', 'anything', 'negative', 'play', 'great', 'talent', 'Keep', 'excellence', 'so', 'bring', 'plays', 'now', 'have', 'books', 'plays', 'ones', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'Keep', 'great', 'work', 'thanks', 'providing', 'good', 'family', 'entertainment', 'Keep', 'coming', 'Just', 'time', 'holidays', 'anytime', 'So', 'happy', 'placed', 'order', 'So', 'much', 'talent', 'Watch', 'husband', 'watch', 'forgiveness', 'temptation', 'strife', 'lessons', 'time', 'not', 'spent', 'home', 'redemption', 'storms', 'relationships..', 'reality', 'look', 'divorce', 'rate', 'African', 'American', 'community', 'marry', 'less', 'have', 'highest', 'divorce', 'rate..', 'something', 'think', '..The', 'grass', 'not', 'greener', 'other', 'side', 'be', 'mowed', 'trimmed', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'dormant', 'seasons', 'withers', 'so', 'want', 'powerful', 'lessons', 'great', 'music', 'i', 'mean', 'music', 'Brent', 'Jones', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'what', 'Brent', 'Jones', 'out', 'many', 'more', 'music', 'talents', 'play', 'great', 'food', 'thought', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'Now', 'back', 'more', 'watching', 'roll', 'floor', 'inspiration', 'Enjoy', 'sure', 'are..', 'Sing', 'Ann', 'Nesby', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Amen', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'Whew', '********6/9/2012****updateWe', 'are', 'still', 'watching', 'still', 'funny', 'roll', 'floor', 'entertaining', 'have', 'shared', 'play', 'family', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'soundtrack', 'play', 'come', 'out', 'Moody', 'still', 'funny', 'even', 'several', 'months', 'later', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'play..If', 'have', 'not', 'purchased', 'play', 'are', 'missing', 'out.Back', 'more', 'great', 'singing', 'humor', 'beautiful', 'stage', 'set', 'great', 'acting']",David E.

Moody was very funny and had me cracking me up in his scenes.  To me this movie was definately comedy but in no way romantic.  They kind of had Brian acting like a maintenance man to Michelle's character but Brian came off completely physco and pathetic.  First of all Michelle was a married woman and yet Brian tries to sweep her of her feet.  Quite tacky.  Michele gives into his advances but it is  very short-lived.  Michelle had no real problems to begin with.  Brian was just crazy.  All the other actors did a good job but Brian to me was very unlikeable.
