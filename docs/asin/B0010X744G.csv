I personally saw this role for anyone else but her. However I liked how she played D.G. and all of the other actors were awesome. The movie is really well done and I must have it on blue ray, but I would like to have subtitles for it, which blue-ray and dvd is missing. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy and OZ. As for all ages, I don't think so. First of all a few bad word were used during the movie, some parents will not like it and last but not least, some may find the fantasy a little dark for children.

Frank Baum's characters are in there, but they're a far different version from the 1939 Judy Garland classic.  There's a Dorothy, who's called ""DG""; a tin man (meaning ""a cop"" here) who was stored in a steel casing for years; the scarecrow is ""Glitch"", a man whose facial features resemble Ray Bolger's (the scarecrow from the 1939 movie), but was an assistant to the good queen and got his brain taken out; the cowardly lion is ""Raw"", who is a psychic.  The travellers must travel through incredible lands (beautiful, fabulous sets and good special effects) to face many dangers as ""DG"" seeks out her real mother and tries to re-unite with her family.  This is a movie the entire family can enjoy.  Tho it is quite a different take from the Oz version we are used to seeing, everything is explained. No sex and some tame violence.  It feels like you're playing a video game, reaching a different level as the group reaches a different land.  It's gripping, fascinating, sometimes humorous, unlike anything I've seen before.

Hm.. for some fetish fans could be any scenes interesting (Leather/Rubber Uniforms/Clothes).Very nice are the trivias / references to the original 1939 THE WIZARD OF OZ Movie:The Housenumber where D.G. (for Dorothy Gale) is living has the number 39. It can been seen in a scene before the storm is beginning. Its a reference to the year of 1939.During the dream sequence, DG is asked if she's been having dreams again, and she says, ""Yeah, in Technicolor."" ""TEchnicolor"" was the camera process who gave the 1939 movie the wonderful color.The officer who's giving D.G. on the beginning of the movie a ticket for her driving has the name Gulch. A reference to Miss Gulch.Near on the beginning of part 2, DG calls her father ""Popsicle"". In the ""Wicked"" stage version its also mentioned but by Glinda the Good Witch.My mind: the Mini-Serie is very nice and interesting. The special effects are sometime not quite perfect and looks cheap (any creatures!). Others looks very good.The picture quality is good. The soundtrack is english and contains english subtitles (which I need sometime as help).Also very nice - the bonus-features have a lenght of approx. 155 minutes and are interesting (Interviews, behind-the-scenes documentaries).FAZIT: Of course, its quite different from the 1939 movie which was very magic and beautiful. No other new movie/remake will get his ""magic"". Don't try to compare it. Zooey Deschanel is not Judy Garland, Neal McDonough is not THE Tin Man like Ray Bolger it was.

Tin Man's OZ is not the largely sweetness and light Oz of the 1929 version's fame.  This Oz is ""The O.Z"" (O.Z. = ""outer zone"").

That something more, at least in her mind, never included the Outer Zone...which of course, she enters.The acting is strong at times, weak at others, but entertaining throughout.I enjoyed the different slant that the writers took in this post-Wizard of Oz and emerald city view of the Outer Zone.  There are Gestapo-like ""long-coats"", evil scientists in the employ of the princess, an Outer Zone resistance movement, and D.G. gets dumped into the middle of this.All in all a good made-for-TV mini-series hosted by the Sci-Fi Network.

The visual effects are wonderful, as are the characterizations and most of the acting (sorry, but I just didn't care for Deschanel, who displayed two facial expressions throughout the whole thing). The rest of the movie made up for her, though, and was a thoroughly enjoyable romp down the yellow brick road.There was a element of sadness for me, though. I suppose I'm nostalgic for what I remember as a brighter, more cheerful past. In today's world, anything as light-hearted, sweet, and joyful as the original (flying monkeys notwithstanding) wouldn't have a chance. Like the residents of OZ, it's as if we're living in a post apocalyptic world, full of fears and hate and dangers. That there is hope at the end of the road (the yellow brick one, of course) is my only consolation. I just wish today's young people could be treated to films that aren't always dark and edgy.

1127233,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B0010X744G,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[33, 80]","This was disappointing overall. I was excited when I heard they were doing a sci-fi version of the story, but in the back of my mind there was this gnawing doubt that turned out to be dead on correct. Hollywood, especially television, is a wasteland with very few pleasant spots, and here is yet another tumbleweed rolling by.I understand that a great deal of people enjoyed this miniseries which Sci-Fi Channel dubbed 'The Event of the Year'. I am not attacking them, I am simply expressing my own opinion of this presentation.For me this was simply another digital effects laden film that did not have very much to offer. The idea of a new twist on L. Frank Baum's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (which is what this miniseries was touted as being) sounded interesting, but the result was pure disappointment. The creators of this project seemed to not have even cracked open the original Baum book. When I first learned that this was going to be based on the book, I hoped for scenes that involved the Quadling Country, the China People, the mice, the green eyeglasses, a one-eyed witch with control over bees and wolves. What I got was typical fare of today's TV movies, and it wasn't surprising at all. Sci-Fi Channel's original movies are hardly good entertainment anyway.It's a shame because this movie could have been good. Between the original book and the MGM musical, there is much to play with in terms of story and themes. But it was all lifeless, washed out looking, dull, and even cringe-inducing at times. ""The little bitch has gone to see the wizard."" Come on. Really? And the Azkadelia character (or Vidalia or Azkaban or whatever she's called) had just two expressions: icy suppressed rage and snide sarcasm. Not a threatening villain in the least for me. And the whole sisters plot idea is from the moon.The Oz material is really a children's territory, and when you twist it into adult fantasy it doesn't work well at all.

It's marvelous!  Amazingly innovative storyline, full of surprises and some serious twists on the original story, but which does not ignore the most important elements of the original cast and story line of Oz.  Dorothy Gale, the original Dorothy character, even puts in a ""black-and-white"" cameo appearance toward the end of the film, handing off her legacy to the ""new"" Dorothy - now known as DG.The plot line keeps you guessing from start to finish!  The Wicked Witch of the West appears to be absolutely gorgeous until the 3rd hour of the film, the Wizard of Oz, played by Richard Dreyfus, is still a hero, but it's DG's father who helps DG most to save the world, and saving the world of the ""Outer Zone"" - (OZ) is what this tale is all about.  The Tin Man is an amazing hero as well, as is the scarecrow.  There is nothing juvenile about this tale of magic, bravery, the building of trust between friends and the recognition of true heroism.  There's plenty of humor, surprises and action in this story, and I found it thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.

1127236,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0010X744G,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 1]","""Tin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"" is a superb reworking of both L. Frank Baum's ""Wizard of Oz"" and the classic 1939 film loosely based on it, skillfully weaving elements of both, while creating a world uniquely it's own. This is an Oz with real magic, and equal parts of wonder, humor, and terror, a land I didn't want to leave!Much of the credit goes to the Jill E. Blotevogel, Steven Long Mitchell, and Craig W. Van Sickle teleplay, which avoids the slavish devotion to the 1939 film of previous ""Oz"" incarnations. While it tackles some classic questions from the original movie, head on (""Was Glinda actually Dorothy's mother, as her character was the only one in the film without a Kansas counterpart?""), it also reminds viewers that Baum's book wasn't only an American fairy tale, but a cautionary fable of industrial 'progress' butting heads with an agrarian society. Oz is a land of change, a multitude of cultures, and the uneasy coexistence of sorcery with a rising machine culture.Keeping all this from becoming too 'heavy' is director Nick Willing's tongue-in-cheek humor, and a terrific cast, headed by Zooey Deschanel as a less-than-reverent DG. Her skepticism and growing awareness of her actual role in events is the core of the film, and she is quite wonderful. Equally good are her companions, Alan Cumming as zipper-headed ""Glitch"" (his brain was stolen), Neal McDonough as an ex-lawman (first encountered imprisoned in a metallic 'suit'), and Raoul Trujillo (looking remarkably like Bert Lahr) as a cowardly member of a lion-like telepathic species. Yes, Toto is here, too (but there is a surprise I'll let you discover when you view the film!)The witches and wizards are a major treat of the film, although Richard Dreyfuss' role, based on the Wizard of Oz, himself, is smaller than you'd expect. However, lovely Kathleen Robertson, as the wicked witch Azkadellia, is fabulous, with an old crone within her every bit as ugly as Margaret Hamilton!There is so much to enjoy in ""Tin Man"", and so many subtle references to Baum's vision and the 1939 film, that it simply can't be viewed only once.

1127241,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0010X744G,Brian E. Erland,"[1, 1]","Prepare yourself for surprising and unexpected twists and turns in an Oz that even Judy Garland wouldn't be able to recognize. This time it's Zooey Deschanel as DG (i.e. Dorothy Gale), the traveler, or ""slipper"" between worlds who finds herself in a perilous situation that makes the original 1939 film look like a carefree walk in the park. Though this is a made-for-television mini-series the production values are stellar and the cast superior. I don't think Zooey has ever let me down and her courageous companions; Alan Cumming, Neal McDonough and Raoul Truijillo add a lot of energy and personality to keep the audience focused on this somewhat overly lengthy production. Kathleen Robertson was also a big plus as DG's older, allegedly evil sister Azkadellia, adding a much appreciated touch of sexuality to keep the adult, male audience occupied.What really makes this storyline unique and entertaining is the massive use of creative license to adapt the original plot, landscape and characters into a new imaginative vision while still maintaining a credible link with the original cinematic classic. The first indication one gets that this tale will be different from what they're used to comes just by reading the title chosen for this mini-series. Why would they omit Oz and Dorothy from the title and call it `Tin Man'? To be sure more surprises lay ahead for the intrepid viewer. The second major change is the clever way in which the word Oz is changed from the name of a place to an acronym of a place. It's not Oz anymore, it's the O.Z. meaning the Outer Zone. Yes there are lots of subtle alterations like this to keep the viewing audience on its toes.I was also pleased by the updated metamorphosis taken place within the ranks of DG's trio of fellow sojourners. The Scarecrow was no more, now replaced by Glitch (Cumming), a lobotomized human with a prominent zipper down the middle of his hairline, an ex-cop named Cain (McDough) nicknamed Tin Man because of the badge he used to carry and Raw (Truijillo), a member of a race of empathic, hairy, lion-like beings who possess the ability to read minds. Even little, loveable Toto has returned, but not in a form you would have ever anticipated. Toto is only the animal form of a shapeshifter known as Tutor when in human form. Be prepared for a lot more changes than just the few mentioned here.On the negative side I'd have to mention the Evil Witches scheme to bring permanent darkness to the O.Z. wasn't very original. If you've seen `Kull the Conqueror' ('97) or `Hellboy ('07) you've seen it before. The other drawback is the length of the production which is a common concern when it comes to mini-series. About midway through you might find yourself losing interest, however If you make it to Part 3 the storyline accelerates and you'll find yourself infused with a shot of adrenaline with the introduction of several unanticipated plot maneuvers that will carry the now invigorated viewer to the end.",4,"""And Something About An Evil Witch"" ~ Bringing Permanent Darkness To The O.Z.",1226188800,"11 9, 2008",2008,2977,"['Prepare', 'surprising', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'Oz', 'even', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'time', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'DG', 'i.e', 'Dorothy', 'Gale', 'traveler', 'slipper', 'worlds', 'who', 'perilous', 'situation', 'original', '1939', 'film', 'look', 'carefree', 'walk', 'park', 'made-for-television', 'mini-series', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'stellar', 'cast', 'superior', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Zooey', 'ever', 'let', 'down', 'courageous', 'companions', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'Raoul', 'Truijillo', 'add', 'lot', 'energy', 'personality', 'keep', 'audience', 'focused', 'somewhat', 'overly', 'lengthy', 'production', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'was', 'also', 'big', 'DG', 'older', 'allegedly', 'evil', 'sister', 'Azkadellia', 'adding', 'much', 'appreciated', 'touch', 'sexuality', 'keep', 'adult', 'male', 'audience', 'occupied.What', 'really', 'storyline', 'unique', 'entertaining', 'massive', 'use', 'creative', 'license', 'adapt', 'original', 'plot', 'landscape', 'characters', 'new', 'imaginative', 'vision', 'still', 'maintaining', 'credible', 'link', 'original', 'cinematic', 'classic', 'first', 'indication', 'one', 'tale', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'what', ""'re"", 'used', 'just', 'reading', 'title', 'chosen', 'mini-series', 'Why', 'would', 'omit', 'Oz', 'Dorothy', 'title', 'call', 'Tin', 'Man', 'be', 'sure', 'more', 'surprises', 'lay', 'ahead', 'intrepid', 'viewer', 'second', 'major', 'change', 'clever', 'way', 'word', 'Oz', 'changed', 'name', 'place', 'acronym', 'place', 'not', 'Oz', 'anymore', 'O.Z', 'meaning', 'Outer', 'Zone', 'are', 'lots', 'subtle', 'alterations', 'keep', 'viewing', 'audience', 'toes.I', 'was', 'also', 'pleased', 'updated', 'metamorphosis', 'taken', 'place', 'ranks', 'DG', 'trio', 'fellow', 'sojourners', 'Scarecrow', 'was', 'more', 'now', 'replaced', 'Glitch', 'Cumming', 'lobotomized', 'human', 'prominent', 'zipper', 'down', 'middle', 'hairline', 'ex-cop', 'named', 'Cain', 'McDough', 'nicknamed', 'Tin', 'Man', 'badge', 'used', 'carry', 'Raw', 'Truijillo', 'member', 'race', 'empathic', 'hairy', 'lion-like', 'beings', 'who', 'possess', 'ability', 'read', 'minds', 'Even', 'little', 'loveable', 'Toto', 'returned', 'not', 'form', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'anticipated', 'Toto', 'only', 'animal', 'form', 'shapeshifter', 'known', 'Tutor', 'when', 'human', 'form', 'Be', 'prepared', 'lot', 'more', 'changes', 'just', 'few', 'mentioned', 'negative', 'side', ""'d"", 'have', 'mention', 'Evil', 'Witches', 'scheme', 'bring', 'permanent', 'darkness', 'O.Z', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'original', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Kull', 'Conqueror', ""'97"", 'Hellboy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'drawback', 'length', 'production', 'common', 'concern', 'when', 'mini-series', 'midway', 'might', 'find', 'losing', 'interest', 'however', 'make', 'Part', '3', 'storyline', ""'ll"", 'find', 'infused', 'shot', 'adrenaline', 'introduction', 'several', 'unanticipated', 'plot', 'maneuvers', 'will', 'carry', 'now', 'invigorated', 'viewer', 'end']",Tin Man

But Tin Man was a disappointment in almost every respect.  The acting, even by those who've been good in other movies, was spotty.  No one except Richard Dreyfuss turned in a solid performance throughout.  The story was a taped-together hash of Star Wars, Dark City, Star Trek, and a dozen better shows.  Even the theme music (repeated endlessly and overbearingly) sounded like Harry Potter.The whole thing seemed listless.  The actors didn't seem to be putting much into it, the pace was slow and uneven, and most of the design & art direction was uninspired.  It's completely mediocre, and riding on the coattails of Oz seemed like an act of desperation.  It did not earn its link to the Oz books/movies in any way.  The connection was arbitrary and pointless, though the only modicum of fun was spotting the old familiar faces (Oh!  There's Toto!  Hey, there's the wizard!).  But it seemed unsure what connection, if any, existed in its universe between events in The Wizard of Oz and events in Tin Man.

This re-imagining (or a sequel, depending on how you look at it) of the Wizard of Oz had just about a little bit of everything. You had great CGI, amazing actors, and a pretty interesting plot. The premise of a young girl (who may or may not be the granddaughter of a well known WoO character, I won't spoil it) who travels to another dimension to save the O.Z. is not new, but the steampunk twist on it is.That's not to say that everything was perfect, mind you. At times the plotline seemed to lag a little and there were many developments that seemed to be somewhat unexplained or left to the side in hopes of a sequel or tv series.

1127251,A1DBQOB2CVLDOS,B0010X744G,"Chris Van Deelen ""Chris Van Deelen""","[1, 3]","One thing that I missed from the 90's was the mini series. Back then they had some great ones, such as Stephen King's the Stand and Golden Years, It, just to name a few. I know there were others, but the titles of these evade me at the moment.So, I was very pleased to see that over the past couple of years there have been several new mini series that have popped up, and quite a few of them have been from the Sci Fi Channel.And, thanks to DVD's, I've been able to purchase these DVD's and have been able to watch these mini series at my leisure... which usually means watching the entire thing in one shot because my wife hates to wait.The first one I bought and watched was the mini series called Tin Man. This was a re-imagining of the classic Wizard of Oz.And I do mean re-imagining.Now, I have stated before I've never read the original Oz novel, but I did read Wicked. I will also state that this mini series had far more in common with the Wicked novel than it did the original Wizard of Oz movie starring Judy Garland.D. G., a young woman working as a waitress feels that she doesn't belong. Sure, her family loves her dearly and they are close, but she never felt at home.Well, as you can imagine, there is a good reason for this. This world, the family she's with, she doesn't actually belong here at all. She was actually born in the O.Z, or the Outer Zone.And it isn't until she finds herself under attack from complete strangers in the middle of a storm that she learns the truth.One unexpected tornado ride later, she finds herself deposited in a strange and unsettlingly familiar world.It's in this world that she discovers her true heritage, and the truth behind her parents, and the people she believed were her parents.Just like in the original movie, D.G. finds companions on her journey. A former Advisor to the Queen, who's had his brain removed, the Tin Man, a police officer with vengeance on his mind, and a hirsute man who can see images through emotions - and who is quite the coward.Sound familiar?The mini series is a quest. D.G. has to locate the powerful Mystic Man in a Vegas like city to find out where she needs to go next and what she's to do to fulfill her destiny.Visually it was quite impressive, although the acting was pretty average, as none of the actors in the movie really stuck out in my mind.The movie starred Zooey Deschanel starred as D.G., Alan Cumming as Glitch, Neal McDonough as the Tin Man, Raoul Trujillo as Raw, Kathleen Robertson as Azkadellia and Richard Drefuss as the Mystic Man.I have to admit that despite the fact that it had so little to do with what I remember about the Wizard of Oz, I was enthralled by the mini series and I did enjoy it.Even though it was quite clich&eacute; in parts.The one thing that set it apart from a full length series is that it had a clearly defined beginning, middle and end. There really wasn't any `filler' as you would find in a typical series, which meant that the writers could tell the story in one shot.I hope that this won't be construed as a spoiler, but near the end of the mini series it is discovered that it is, in fact, more of a sequel than an actual re-imagining. I don't know about other people, but I liked that.The world itself is a mixture of magic and modern technology. You have powerful sorcerers, people who can read thoughts, Tornados that can break the barriers between worlds, but you also have gun-slingers, automobiles and the like.It was worth watching, and I found it quite enjoyable. It certainly has renewed my interest in the mini series, something we haven't seen in a very long time.This, at the time of me writing this review is just the first of four mini series that I have and will be watching.

1127252,A21KM4ZAKY9U9S,B0010X744G,Chrome Oxide,"[7, 14]","I can't believe I watched the whole thing!I should have turned this off after D.G. arrives in O.Z. and meets a zipperhead, a person who has had their brains removed, and yet still is able to walk and talk and interact with people.  By the end of the mini-series, I was convinced the scriptwriter was a zipperhead.Aside from the zipperhead character, which should be more than enough to tell you the kind of thinking that went into writing this alternate universe story, there was the oddest collection of primitive technology, steampunk technology, superscience and magic all mixed together in a random fashion.People drove cars that looked like they were new during the 1930s and the military drove what looked World War II military vehicles.  The military reminded me of World War II German soldiers.There were iron maiden style suits you could lock people in for years that provided all the nourishment that anyone would need to survive.  I wasn't sure if that was supposed to be science or magic.  The one person we meet who has been imprisoned for years (very long hair and beard) is able to walk out without the expected atrophied muscles I would have expected under the circumstances.There were holographic projectors that displayed images in broad daylight that were real enough to confuse onlookers into thinking they were the real thing.  Was this science or magic?There were robots that were so lifelike that D.G. never knew that her (foster) parents were actually robots.  Nobody living in contemporary Earth knew they were robots either.  Pretty impressive technology.  Although when the robot parents returned to their hometown, they were met with a very steampunk cyborg.An evil witch, who manages to be imprisoned without a body for 500 years is helped by D.G. to escape her prison and take of the body of her older sister, Azkadellia.  Shortly thereafter Azkadellia kills D.G.  Their mom brings D.G. back to life but loses all her magical ability in the process.  All her magic has been transferred into D.G.Then there is the evil witch sister, Azkadellia.  She is able to teleport, keeps flying monkeys stored on her chest as tattoos and sucks souls out of people that displease her.  When she is not using a teleporting spell to visit her imprisoned mom, she uses horses rather than cars for transportation.  Did I mention yet that they have the ability to move between (teleport?) Earth and O.Z.?The evil witch has built a machine, that wouldn't be out of place in a World War II epic, which is supposed to be the power plant for some kind of laser to be used to end the world.Whenever the evil people use their streampunk technology (mind control devices, prison doors, brain in a jar computer with the adding machine interface) the controls never look like they could possibly be functional.Are you with me so far?There are plenty of other examples of why having a brain makes this a difficult mini-series to watch.  Instead I will go to the stake in the heart of this story.  The moment when I had to ask myself, how could I have wasted that much time watching this came near the end when D.G. talks Azkadellia into fighting the influence of the 500 year old witch that inhabits her body.  This is the 500 year old witch who has killed D.G. once already, the 500 year old witch who eats the souls of people that bother her, the 500 year old witch who enslaved the whole land, the 500 year old witch who personally killed or ordered killed many people, the 500 year old witch who imprisoned many people (a massive prison is featured in a couple of scenes), the 500 year old witch who enlisted an army to do her evil bidding, the 500 year old witch who had enslaved Azkadellia for years, after all that, all it took for Azkadellia, to fight off the evil witch was D.G. saying please fight.  Even better, when did this fight happen?  Not when the evil witch is tired or recovering from exerting herself.  No, this takes place with the evil witch at the height of her powers after she managed to gain possession of the all powerful green gem.I'm sorry, but as bad and as dumb as the mini-series was up to this point, the ending is so over the top bad and so unbelievable that I had to write this negative review.",1,Wooden Tin Man,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,4231,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'should', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'D.G', 'arrives', 'O.Z', 'zipperhead', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'brains', 'removed', 'yet', 'still', 'able', 'walk', 'talk', 'interact', 'people', 'end', 'mini-series', 'was', 'convinced', 'scriptwriter', 'was', 'zipperhead.Aside', 'zipperhead', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'enough', 'tell', 'kind', 'thinking', 'went', 'writing', 'alternate', 'universe', 'story', 'was', 'oddest', 'collection', 'primitive', 'technology', 'steampunk', 'technology', 'superscience', 'magic', 'mixed', 'together', 'random', 'fashion.People', 'drove', 'cars', 'looked', 'were', 'new', '1930s', 'military', 'drove', 'what', 'looked', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'military', 'vehicles', 'military', 'reminded', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'German', 'were', 'iron', 'maiden', 'style', 'suits', 'could', 'lock', 'people', 'years', 'provided', 'nourishment', 'anyone', 'would', 'need', 'survive', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'science', 'magic', 'one', 'person', 'meet', 'who', 'been', 'imprisoned', 'years', 'very', 'long', 'hair', 'beard', 'able', 'walk', 'expected', 'atrophied', 'muscles', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'circumstances.There', 'were', 'holographic', 'projectors', 'displayed', 'images', 'broad', 'daylight', 'were', 'real', 'enough', 'confuse', 'onlookers', 'thinking', 'were', 'real', 'thing', 'Was', 'science', 'magic', 'were', 'robots', 'were', 'so', 'lifelike', 'D.G', 'never', 'knew', 'foster', 'parents', 'were', 'actually', 'robots', 'Nobody', 'living', 'contemporary', 'Earth', 'knew', 'were', 'robots', 'either', 'Pretty', 'impressive', 'technology', 'when', 'robot', 'parents', 'returned', 'hometown', 'were', 'met', 'very', 'steampunk', 'cyborg.An', 'evil', 'witch', 'who', 'be', 'imprisoned', 'body', '500', 'years', 'helped', 'D.G', 'escape', 'prison', 'take', 'body', 'older', 'sister', 'Azkadellia', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'Azkadellia', 'kills', 'D.G', 'mom', 'D.G', 'back', 'life', 'magical', 'ability', 'process', 'magic', 'been', 'transferred', 'D.G.Then', 'evil', 'witch', 'sister', 'Azkadellia', 'able', 'teleport', 'keeps', 'flying', 'monkeys', 'stored', 'chest', 'tattoos', 'sucks', 'souls', 'people', 'displease', 'When', 'not', 'using', 'teleporting', 'spell', 'visit', 'imprisoned', 'mom', 'horses', 'rather', 'cars', 'transportation', 'Did', 'mention', 'yet', 'have', 'ability', 'move', 'teleport', 'Earth', 'O.Z', 'evil', 'witch', 'built', 'machine', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'epic', 'supposed', 'be', 'power', 'plant', 'kind', 'laser', 'be', 'used', 'end', 'world.Whenever', 'evil', 'people', 'use', 'streampunk', 'technology', 'mind', 'control', 'devices', 'prison', 'doors', 'brain', 'jar', 'computer', 'adding', 'machine', 'interface', 'controls', 'never', 'look', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'functional.Are', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'examples', 'why', 'having', 'brain', 'difficult', 'mini-series', 'watch', 'Instead', 'will', 'go', 'stake', 'heart', 'story', 'moment', 'when', 'had', 'ask', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'wasted', 'much', 'time', 'watching', 'came', 'end', 'when', 'D.G', 'talks', 'Azkadellia', 'fighting', 'influence', '500', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'body', '500', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'killed', 'D.G', 'once', 'already', '500', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'souls', 'people', 'bother', '500', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'enslaved', 'whole', 'land', '500', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'personally', 'killed', 'ordered', 'killed', 'many', 'people', '500', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'imprisoned', 'many', 'people', 'massive', 'prison', 'featured', 'couple', 'scenes', '500', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'enlisted', 'army', 'do', 'evil', 'bidding', '500', 'year', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'had', 'enslaved', 'Azkadellia', 'years', 'took', 'Azkadellia', 'fight', 'off', 'evil', 'witch', 'was', 'D.G', 'saying', 'please', 'fight', 'Even', 'better', 'when', 'did', 'fight', 'happen', 'Not', 'when', 'evil', 'witch', 'tired', 'recovering', 'exerting', 'No', 'place', 'evil', 'witch', 'height', 'powers', 'managed', 'gain', 'possession', 'powerful', 'green', 'gem.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'bad', 'as', 'dumb', 'mini-series', 'was', 'up', 'point', 'ending', 'so', 'top', 'bad', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'had', 'write', 'negative', 'review']",Tin Man

Frankly, I'm still not too old for witches and munchkins, even at the age of 50-something. It's just that sci-fi has been added when it really didn't need to be.The two sisters Dee-Gee (for Dorothy Gale) and Azkadellia, both are attractive antagonists, but the problem with the entire plot is that the wicked Azkadellia's chief goal throughout this entire story is to just blow up the Outer Zone (OZ). That's it, nothing more, except that she has many, many people with homes and families who are assisting her in this.My thought was: Why????It would be one thing is she wanted the same old power and gain routine that bad people want, but no, she wants to vaporize the entire zone. And it doesn't make sense. And if this is so science fiction, why do we need witches, anyway? Sci-Fi should not interject itself into fantasy and vice versa. Yet here were have technical wonders being admired by a magic-casting sorceress. And why would her evil minions support her in the destruction of OZ?

Set several generations after the original OZ tale, this is the story of Dorothy Gale's great granddaughter who has to fight against her possessed sister to save OZ. For those who are fans of the original story, look for details cleverly interwoven into or scattered throughout the story that echo the original tale in some way. There are many and each time I watch it, I catch more. Brilliantly done.  The Tin Man was played very powerfully by Neal McDonough - he almost steals the show, for those with a heart. Zooey Claire Deschanel is just wonderful as DG; while her acting is considered deadpan by some, her face is so expressive - I know people in real life just like DG's character. Kathleen Robertson is delicious as the evil Azkadellia. In fact, most of the actors are well suited for their characters. For me, the only exception is the guy who plays DG's real dad. He was OK, and may be a fine actor, I just didn't think he was best person for this particular role. But the rest - great. Oh, and the soundtrack - while not a musical like the original OZ movie, the soundtrack is well done. Anyway, one of the too few times that SyFy channel lives up to its motto of ""Imagine Greater.""

One hears enough to enjoy it  but not enough to follow many parts in detail.One need fear little or no interference with gratification from the potential memory clash with the classic musical based on the same original. There is no singing to Arlen and Harburg tunes, and no attempt to duplicate the unique qualities of Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger and Jack Haley, much less, Margaret Hamilton (the wicked witch) or Billie Burke (The Good Witch).Standing on its own, this is an entertaining version of the Frank Baum original, with a less distinguished cast than assayed the parts in the late thirties, but with a different set of expectations (straight acting) than pertained in the earlier work. The cast does a good job in a situation where overacting is invited by the situations played. No doubt to subdue the almost inevitable (with the older audience) temptation to recall the earlier musical score, this one has a strong musical background, often emphasized in scenes.Unless divided into its component three parts by the listener, there is a tendency toward tedium. More than 90 minutes at a time is a bit overlong.

Instead what you get is a TRULY FANTASTIC movie that plays as a sequel of sorts to the original classic. This is a twisted, wonderful, and very unique spin to the Wizard of Oz.

Alan Cumming does an excellent job as Glitch, the brainless sidekick. Neal McDonough is perfect in the masculine role of a ""Tin Man"". Kathleen Robertson is also perfection as the wicked Azkadellia.The DVD lacks a bit with special features, but the enhanced graphics and sound make it worth the purchase.With a reported budget just under $20 million for a six-hour made-for-TV Movie, my kudos go out to the special effects team. It's no movie fare (this is Sci-Fi), but it certainly is eye-catching; really something to see. Standouts are ""Central City"" and the ""Ice Palace"".This is pure entertainment for those with lengthy and active imaginations.I highly recommend this for all sci-fi and fantasy lovers!If there is one flaw, it's the ending.

Williams ""Nunah""","[2, 2]","When the Wizard of Oz was first released during the Great Depression, my Dad was a ten year old providing for his family by farm labor (picking cotton by hand etc) in the Arizona ""farmland"" around Eloy Arizona. When I was a child he related the story to me of how he paid to get in to see The Wizard of Oz for the first time, he traded the metallic tops off of milk bottles.When I was a boy growing up in the wonderland now known as the ""OC"" (five miles from Disneyland, 1 mile from Knott's berry farm (of course back then it was a berry farm) and 12 miles from Huntington Beach) my favorite day of the year was the night that The Wizard of Oz would come on TV. Then, in 1967 when we got our first ""Color TV"" I loved it even more. Then came the age of VHS, and DVD and as my children grew up, we have watched the Wizard of Oz over and over every year, and the My first grand-daughter got old enough to watch it, it also became a favorite of hers. So for Four generations The Wizard of Oz has been a favorite in my family.So when I saw advertisements, for Tin Man on Sci-Fi Channel, I had a certain amount of trepidation for watching what I assumed would be a retelling of one of my all time favorite films. I didn't get around to setting the TIVO to record it when it came on and I forgot all about it until I saw it for sale at a club store. I still didn't want to get it enough to buy it until one of my colleagues told me how much he liked it. So.... This weekend I got around to buying TIN MAN.Here is my take.Tin Man is not a re-telling of The Wizard of Oz. It takes place in the future of Dorothy's visit. It is a darker slightly more mature tale, probably not appropriate for pre-teens.Wizard of Oz was a wonderful musical, Tin Man is a straight up fantasy. I think this is a wise decision.  Musicals should be left to Disney for the time being.Wizard of Oz, had really cutting edge effects for the time, but are quite cheesy by today's standards, Tin Man had amazing special affects. Wizard of Oz had very funny parts, which were kind of lacking in Tin Man. Metaphors were different in both movies some played better in one, and some better in the other. But the two big metaphors still stand out, from the Wizard of Oz home is the place that is important, and in Tin Man family is who is important.  I also liked the aspect of redemption and resolution that was the gist of the story of Tin Man.So is Tin Man destined to be a classic on the order of the Wizard of Oz? I'd say probably not. Is it a very good way to spend a few hours of your time? Absolutely, it is one of the best new things I have seen in quite some time. Is it well spent money? Absolutely, I think I will watch this several times more, just not as many times as I have watched the Wizard of Oz.If you like a fantasy film with a modern twist, beautifully filmed with a bit of cheese on top, then this is a film for you",5,Not your Father's OZ ****&1/2,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,2896,"['When', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Dad', 'was', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'providing', 'family', 'farm', 'labor', 'picking', 'cotton', 'hand', 'etc', 'Arizona', 'farmland', 'Eloy', 'Arizona', 'When', 'was', 'child', 'related', 'story', 'how', 'paid', 'get', 'see', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'first', 'time', 'traded', 'metallic', 'tops', 'milk', 'bottles.When', 'was', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'wonderland', 'now', 'known', 'OC', 'five', 'miles', 'Disneyland', '1', 'mile', 'Knott', 'berry', 'farm', 'course', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'berry', 'farm', '12', 'miles', 'Huntington', 'Beach', 'favorite', 'day', 'year', 'was', 'night', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'would', 'come', 'TV', 'Then', '1967', 'when', 'got', 'first', 'Color', 'TV', 'loved', 'even', 'more', 'Then', 'came', 'age', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'children', 'grew', 'up', 'have', 'watched', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'year', 'My', 'first', 'grand-daughter', 'got', 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'also', 'became', 'favorite', 'hers', 'So', 'Four', 'generations', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'been', 'favorite', 'family.So', 'when', 'saw', 'advertisements', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'had', 'certain', 'amount', 'trepidation', 'watching', 'what', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'retelling', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'setting', 'TIVO', 'record', 'when', 'came', 'forgot', 'saw', 'sale', 'club', 'store', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'enough', 'buy', 'one', 'colleagues', 'told', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'So', 'weekend', 'got', 'around', 'buying', 'TIN', 'MAN.Here', 'take.Tin', 'Man', 'not', 're-telling', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'place', 'future', 'Dorothy', 'visit', 'darker', 'slightly', 'more', 'mature', 'tale', 'probably', 'not', 'appropriate', 'pre-teens.Wizard', 'Oz', 'was', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'Tin', 'Man', 'straight', 'up', 'fantasy', 'think', 'wise', 'decision', 'Musicals', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'Disney', 'time', 'being.Wizard', 'Oz', 'had', 'really', 'cutting', 'edge', 'effects', 'time', 'are', 'quite', 'cheesy', 'today', 'standards', 'Tin', 'Man', 'had', 'amazing', 'special', 'affects', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'had', 'very', 'funny', 'parts', 'were', 'kind', 'lacking', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Metaphors', 'were', 'different', 'movies', 'played', 'better', 'one', 'better', 'other', 'two', 'big', 'metaphors', 'still', 'stand', 'out', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'home', 'place', 'important', 'Tin', 'Man', 'family', 'who', 'important', 'also', 'liked', 'aspect', 'redemption', 'resolution', 'was', 'gist', 'story', 'Tin', 'Man.So', 'Tin', 'Man', 'destined', 'be', 'classic', 'order', 'Wizard', 'Oz', ""'d"", 'say', 'probably', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'time', 'Absolutely', 'one', 'best', 'new', 'things', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'money', 'Absolutely', 'think', 'will', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'more', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'watched', 'Wizard', 'Oz.If', 'fantasy', 'film', 'modern', 'twist', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'bit', 'cheese', 'top', 'then', 'film']",Tin Man

1127278,A3C94LV082BV2T,B0010X744G,"J. Davis ""Just a guy.""","[0, 0]","First off, the first thing you see is the cover. Well, the holographic foil on the paperboard sleeve is pretty striking. (Wait... The paperboard sleeve is the collectible O-Ring packaging?) Only problem is... the original cover design (and an early poster) were pretty dynamic. This falls a little flat.Okay, when you insert the first DVD (both of which look pretty nice, but you can easily tell which one is which), you get the copyright notice, the company notice, some previews (which I didn't note, but there's quite a few), then the menu has a nice animation, and a nice little movie showing clips from the whole series. (Disc 2 is the same, without the previews.)Disc 1 has Part 1 and Part 2 on it, no special features. Also absent is alternate language tracks, alternate audio tracks (so no commentary), and subtitles. (There is also no Closed Captions, but this isn't on a DVD menu.) There are scene selections, eight scenes for each part, and the scene selections for each part run into each other, reminding you that these are both parts of one story.The story opens with a young woman named DG who lives in Kansas with her folks. She has strange dreams where she sees strange scenes and a beautiful woman with lavendar eyes speaks and sings to her. She is a free spirit, ready to tease Officer Elmer Gulch (yes, you heard right) on her motorcycle.But a storm is coming...DG and her parents are surprised one night by men in strange trenchcoats. DG is led to the roof by her parents and is made to jump into a tornado!DG awakes in a strange country, where she finds ruin from her house in Kansas, no sign of her parents, and midgets who capture her, believing her to be a spy of the Sorceress Azkadelia. While imprisoned, she meets Glitch, a man with a zipper in his skull. Half of his brain has been removed, so ""sometimes my synapses don't fly right."" He reveals that DG has entered ""The O.Z.,"" the Outer Zone.DG and Glitch escape, and wind up rescuing Wyatt Cain, a Tin Man, one of the Mystic Man's police force. Cain helps them save Raw (a ""viewer,"" a half beast/half man race. Raw himself bears a resemblance to the portrayals of the Cowardly Lion by Bert Lahr and Ted Ross.) from becoming dinner in the Fields of the Papay.As they take the Old Road (or ""The Brick Route"") to Central City, DG discovers that the O.Z. is in fact her home. She finds her ""parents"" (or, as they call themselves, ""nurture units"") are more android than human. In fact, they are not her parents. Her mother seems to be the mysterious woman from her dreams.DG and her comrades make it to Central City, where they see the Mystic Man, who reveals that DG needs to unlock her memories, so DG must go north.As DG journeys the O.Z., she (and we, as the audience) discovers many fascinating items of her past. Azkadelia is wicked, or is she? Who are her parents? Who was the other girl she lived with in the O.Z.? What secrets lie in the past of Glitch and Cain? And what is the Emerald of the Eclipse, and where is it?The acting in Tin Man is superb. Zooey Deschanel as DG is endearing, although some feel her natural charm was wasted on the role. Alan Cumming is hilarious and serious as Glitch, pulling off the role with a professional air. Neal McDonough is dead-serious as Cain, but can be emotional when he needs to. Raoul Trujillo is excellent at re-inventing the mighty, sniveling beast. And Kathleen Robertson... WOW! She pulls off evil in a way that rivals Tilda Swinton!The special effects and CG are almost believable. Not quite lifelike, but these work excellently.The story is captivating and intriguing. The writing is simply delicious. However, something lacks: there is a lot of backstory not explained in the 4 & 1/2 hours that Tin Man approximately runs for. I would like to see the story continue, myself. Maybe a sequel, or TV series, or series of sequels?The video quality is very good. I believe it's the best definition you can get on a standard DVD. The episodes have been extended. There are additional little scenes, like more fun with Glitch, more evilness with Azkadelia, and more tracking with Cain. These scenes neither make the series better nor make it worse.Disc 2 only has Part 3 and the Special Features. Part 3 is also extended.In addition, the opening title card and credits are now absent from parts 2 & 3 (but the video is still there) and there is no end credits on parts 1 & 2, and the opening credits on part 1 and the end credits on part 3 have been expanded to cover the entire series.The Special Features are quite good, making this another rarity when it comes to Oz DVDs. (Very few have good special features.)First up is the ""Beyond the Yellow Brick Road: The Making of Tin Man"" feature. This was aired on SciFi about a week before the miniseries (and was also a popular bootleg download and the only feature available on bootleg Tin Man DVDs), so this makes it a nice addition.Next up is a new documentary: ""On The Set With The Director,"" a documentary that, once again, goes behind the scenes and lets the cast and crew talk about working with director Nick Willing.Now we have the ""Blooper Reel."" Ah, yes. We all love to see the cast mess up on their lines and cues... except that doesn't happen much here. It's mostly the crew joking around and the cast having downtime. Still fun to watch, but it should have been called by a different name.Next up is raw footage of interviews with Nick Willing, Zooey Deschanel, Alan Cumming, and Neal McDonough. Some of this, if you're watching the special features sequentially, will sound familiar, as some of it was used in the featurettes. You can also faintly hear the interviewer asking questions and the director, actor or actress listening to them. This can be a little distracting, but most of the time it is bearable. Sadly, Miss Deschanel is not a good interviewee. She even has to ask the interviewer to re-state the actual question. We do learn some interesting things about the cast and crew, though.Finally is the full-length Tin Man trailer. This was all over the Internet, and probably on SciFi, too, so you've probably seen it.All in all, if I had to rate this DVD on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it an 8. Lack of subtitles, closed captioning (come on, fans whipped up a set of subtitles for the bootleg video files), and the special features, while there is a considerable amount, could have been a bit better.I say, add it to your Oz collection. It's probably the best re-imagining of Oz that goes far-out while not raping Baum's original vision that we'll get for a long time.If you buy the DVD at Borders, specially marked DVDs have an exclusive premium, an acetane pouch with a third disc inside the case.The menu is not unlike the Special Features on Disc 2. We have three selections here. The first two are fancily titled interviews with Kathleen Robertson and Raoul Trujillio. These are much like the interviews on Disc 2, the actor and actress not in costume, seated in what looks like one of the sets, answering questions from the same interviewer, who we can't hear any better than we could before. Both Kathleen and Raoul interview very well, and the interviews are a little over ten minutes long each.The other item is over a half-hour long. It shows behind-the-scenes footage of the Mystic Man's show, including a deleted item wherein Zooey Deschanel's DG asks the Mystic Man for help. (We also get a good look at some decor at the show: a pillar shaped like a cyclone with many farmhouse items being spun around in it.) However, the repeated takes of the Mystic Man's show gets old very quickly. To be sure, this gives you a taste of what it's like to work on a film, but when you're not involved, it gets dull.As with many premium bonus DVDs, this disc is not completely satisfying, but it is nice to see these uncut interviews with Kathleen and Raoul. As afore mentioned, the behind-the-scenes of the Mystic Man gives us a realistic glimpse of how much time is taken to shoot a scene that runs for just a few minutes. Altogether, not a bad addition.(Thanks to Sharon of Curiozity Corner for confirming the existence of the Borders DVD and identifying the material the pouch is made of.)",4,Warning!

Superb cast, excel. special effects and veryprovocative story lines; in my opinion one of the most imaginative ones.  Terrific casting of Zooey Deschanel  as ""DG"" and a fine supporting  castthough I wonder if the producers tried to get Zooeys older sister Emily to play her ""evil"" sister.  Perhaps she was tied up with  BONES productionswhich started around the same time this film was being made.  I was absolutely enchanted by Zooey who I never heard of before this film.  I generallydo not like actors-actresses very much and have little respect Hollywood (or weird) though I do occasionally take in a movie now and then.  I lovegood fantasy and sci fi movies and this one fills the  bill. It was Zooey in this film that eventually led me down the road to BONES TV program whichI fell in love with.  And Emily along with Zooey I think are amoung the two most beautiful women I have ever scene: perfect in every way from glorious blue eyes to brunette hair ( do not like blonds!).  I am still enchanted with them though FOX seems to be paring down the partnership withBooth a bit, something I do not like.  And I would like to see Zooey make a few more cameo appearances with her sister, playing her sec. cousin.  They both can act as well as sing beautifully.But more on the TIN MAN.  I just love the way throughout the film there are subtle and sometimes not subtle references to the great MGM move THEWIZARD OF OZ, now of course is owned by WARNER BROS.  Some parts of the O.Z. (OUTER ZONE) are not very nice (sort of like New Jersey) and CentralCity, the Emerald City of the O.Z., is becoming more like Detroit under the tyranny of the beautiful but nasty Sorceress who also is the sister ofDG.  The TIN MAN gets his name from being a policeman at one time before he gets locked up in a kind of old fashioned diving suit like device.  This tale is a long one, about 4&1/2 hours without commercials but is very enjoyable.  I did not see it on TV until I watched it on my DVD set (I boughtfrom AMAZON of course!).  I have watched the replays later on TV.  I don't wish to say more for those who might read my little lines of whit, andhave not seen the film, but if you like fun, heroism, feisty (and beautiful) Zooey, good special effects and a happy ending then this is for you.This is really not a childrens movie but there really isn't anything in it that is offensive either.

Tin Man may hack the Wizard of Oz story to bits trying to recreate the story and it succeeds in being entertaining even if it is silly. Tin Man is just fun and well acted and I honestly didn't even want it to end. Neal McDonough (Walking Tall) I always thought of as poor man's Ray Liotta but he gives what should be a star making performance. He gives the more interesting performance of the mini-series. He plays Cain who's a former Tin Man ""the name of the police of the O Z"" who is a broken man due to his haunting past.I always had a crush on Zooey Deschanel since Elf but I'm still not even sure if she was good as DG or not. She has a lovely voice so the one part I think she really shined is when she sings in one part. Other than that she acts just a little too dopey and expressionless. Alan Cumming is fun as a bit of a fruit ""but cool fruit lol"" that had his brain stolen by Azkadellia ""the Witch"". I find it strange that he doesn't remember much yet he remembers that he can dance and takes out some guards with his dance moves. But hey it's all good fun anyway. Kathleen Robertson as Azkadellia makes a sexy villain but the fact that the flying monkeys fly out of a tattoo on her cleavage almost kills an almost flawless and fun mini-series. Oh plus you might even find it dumb that the Cowardly Lion's name is...Raw and that he's a....psychic or that Toe Toe is a shape shifter. I found that all silly yet I just couldn't stop watching and I hope everyone that watched it gave it a chance.

It's my favorite retelling of the Wizard of Oz story.  This Blu-ray 2 Disc Set has the complete set of extra interviews with the cast as well as a mini-doc about the making of The Mystic Man's cabaret act.  (I particularly enjoyed the interview with Raoul Trujillo who played Raw, the visionary who sees with his heart.)For fans of the 1939 film Wizard of Oz, there are &#34;easter eggs&#34; imbedded throughout Tin Man -- some obvious and some very subtle.  Just spell Ahamo backwards. I dare you. Grin. Sure, Tin Man has flying monkeys -- but they're really scary and fly out of tattoos that adorn the evil witch Azkadellia's cleavage. We're talking scary *cool.*  The scarecrow character, Glitch, is brought to life by Alan Cumming -- whose head sports a snazzy zipper.  The cowardly lion, is the aforementioned Raw,a gentle seer. Toto is there, too, but he's played by the incomparable Blu Mankuma, familiar to sci-fi fans from the New Outer Limits.  But Tin Man is truly carried by Zooey Deschanel as DG and Neal McDonough as Wyatt Cain the Tin Man of the title. DG is a strong female lead that I'd feel comfortable being a role model; and the Tin Man himself is a Good Man.This OZ -- the outer zone -- is peopled with munchkins, robot nurture units, and a Kind Queen, held prisoner by her daughter. And because it was filmed in beautiful British Columbia, the world of the O Z is truly lovely.  Combine the old and new, and you have this lovely fantasy for the ages. All this and Blu, too!I cannot give this edition of Tin Man enough stars.  It's delightful.  It's haunting.  And it's one of my favorite miniseries ever.  Get Tin Man and know the wonder of the O Z.

But neither is it laden with the grim-jawed cynicism of Frank Maguire'sWicked.  And it's hard to classify it as fantasy, not with all the steampunk elements and cross-cultural references that make this Oz more dimensional than the original.  It's more of an immersion in a completely different world, designed to upset expectations and put your brain on a psychic tilt-a-whirl.D.G. (Zooey Deschanel) has been brought forward to the modern Midwest: a technical genius stuck in a rural farming community, she feels her conservative parents and miserable job stifling her.  Only her artwork and her elaborate dreams keep her sane.  When an army of black-clad stormtroopers suddenly attacks the farm, her parents fling her through the whirlwind, claiming she'll be safe on the other side.Once there, the world in which she finds herself could charitably be considered analogous to Baum's original.  It is full of visual and textual allusions to both the novel andthe classic 1939 movie, such as the costume and makeup design of Raoul Trujillo's ""Raw,"" who straddles the line between Burt Lahr's movie character and W.W. Denslow's illustrations.  The Yellow Brick Road is reduced to a minor plot point, but the Witch (Kathleen Robertson) is a much more fully dimensional character, with an intricate history that makes her somewhat sympathetic.The Outer Zone, or O.Z., is a world of moral complexity, where pat answers are few on the ground.  D.G.'s companions must earn her loyalty, and vice versa.  The Tin Man of the title (Neal McDonough), so called because of his Texas Ranger badge and long-barrel revolver, is a grim-faced man who must overcome his wrath if he wants to rediscover his place in the world.  These are not characters who are good or bad because the plot demands it, but because they are fully realized and drive the story under their own forward momentum.Director Nick Willing creates a sophisticated visual backdrop for the characters to move through.  Part rococo technology and part Neuschwanstein majesty, the visual element helps bring home the otherworld quality of this miniseries.  There are a small handful of scenes, particularly when the heroes are fleeing the Witch's tower, when it's obvious the actors are playing against a chromakey set with the hope that the visuals will be matted in later, but these are sparse and not terribly distracting.One element I'm glad for is that D.G. in this version of Oz is fully committed to where she is.  She spares herself, and us, the mewling for home that was so off-putting in the book and the classic movie.  She lives in the present and works toward noble goals, rather than getting caught up in wanting to go backward.  This makes us as an audience want to go forward with her.This is not the same old Oz.  It's a sci-fi fantasy for our more conflicted age, a battle that offers to play itself out and bring us along not because it's supposed to happen, but because its characters and their hope speak to us.  Though probably not for kids, ""Tin Man"" is a fantasy a contemporary audience can believe in.",5,Sci-Fi Fantasy For Our Conflicted Age,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,3181,"['re-imagining', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'classic', 'Wonderful', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'not', 'sweetness', 'light', 'laden', 'grim-jawed', 'cynicism', 'Frank', ""Maguire'sWicked"", 'hard', 'classify', 'fantasy', 'not', 'steampunk', 'elements', 'cross-cultural', 'references', 'make', 'Oz', 'more', 'dimensional', 'original', 'more', 'immersion', 'completely', 'different', 'world', 'designed', 'upset', 'expectations', 'put', 'brain', 'psychic', 'tilt-a-whirl.D.G', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'been', 'brought', 'forward', 'modern', 'Midwest', 'technical', 'genius', 'stuck', 'rural', 'farming', 'community', 'conservative', 'parents', 'miserable', 'job', 'stifling', 'Only', 'artwork', 'elaborate', 'dreams', 'keep', 'sane', 'When', 'army', 'black-clad', 'stormtroopers', 'suddenly', 'farm', 'parents', 'fling', 'whirlwind', 'claiming', ""'ll"", 'be', 'safe', 'other', 'side.Once', 'there', 'world', 'could', 'charitably', 'be', 'considered', 'analogous', 'Baum', 'original', 'full', 'visual', 'textual', 'allusions', 'novel', 'andthe', 'classic', '1939', 'movie', 'such', 'costume', 'makeup', 'design', 'Raoul', 'Trujillo', 'Raw', 'who', 'line', 'Burt', 'Lahr', 'movie', 'character', 'W.W.', 'Denslow', 'illustrations', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'reduced', 'minor', 'plot', 'point', 'Witch', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'much', 'more', 'fully', 'dimensional', 'character', 'intricate', 'history', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic.The', 'Outer', 'Zone', 'O.Z.', 'world', 'moral', 'complexity', 'where', 'pat', 'answers', 'are', 'few', 'ground', 'D.G', 'companions', 'must', 'earn', 'loyalty', 'vice', 'versa', 'Tin', 'Man', 'title', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'so', 'called', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'badge', 'long-barrel', 'revolver', 'grim-faced', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'overcome', 'wrath', 'rediscover', 'place', 'world', 'are', 'not', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'plot', 'are', 'fully', 'realized', 'drive', 'story', 'own', 'forward', 'momentum.Director', 'Nick', 'Willing', 'sophisticated', 'visual', 'backdrop', 'characters', 'move', 'Part', 'technology', 'part', 'Neuschwanstein', 'majesty', 'visual', 'element', 'bring', 'home', 'otherworld', 'quality', 'miniseries', 'are', 'small', 'handful', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'when', 'heroes', 'are', 'fleeing', 'Witch', 'tower', 'when', 'obvious', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'chromakey', 'set', 'hope', 'visuals', 'will', 'be', 'matted', 'later', 'are', 'sparse', 'not', 'terribly', 'distracting.One', 'element', ""'m"", 'glad', 'D.G', 'version', 'Oz', 'fully', 'committed', 'where', 'mewling', 'home', 'was', 'so', 'off-putting', 'book', 'classic', 'movie', 'present', 'noble', 'goals', 'rather', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'wanting', 'go', 'backward', 'audience', 'want', 'go', 'forward', 'her.This', 'not', 'same', 'old', 'Oz', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'more', 'conflicted', 'age', 'battle', 'play', 'out', 'bring', 'not', 'supposed', 'happen', 'characters', 'hope', 'speak', 'Though', 'probably', 'not', 'kids', 'Tin', 'Man', 'fantasy', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'can', 'believe']",Tin Man
1127298,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0010X744G,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 5]","I must admit that I was hesitant to watch SciFi Channel's revisioning of ""The Wizard of Oz"" due to the fact that they were heavily promoting it.  I've learned through the years that 95% of all films, television series, and music that is heavily hyped is usually not that great in the end.  I was pleasantly surprised with this excellent story written by Craig Van Sickle and Steven Long Mitchell.  The tale centers around D.G., a young girl who doesn't feel like she fits in her hometown.  Her parents always talk of better times in a town that seems otherworldly.  Little does she know that there is another place in the magical and mystical O.Z.  When she's chased into a tornado, D.G. finds herself in a world where the wicked Azkadellia and her goons (including flying monkeys) are out to retrieve a secret from her that she doesn't even know she has.  Along the way, D.G. meets a group of unlikely heroes like the goofy Glitch, the sensitive Raw, and the standoffish Cain.  What's D.G.'s secret? Who's the Mystic Man?  What destiny awaits D.G. and her friends?  Watch ""Tin Man"" to find out.Directed by Nick Willing, ""Tin Man"" features an excellent cast.  The lovely Zooey Deschanel portrays D.G.  Kathleen Robertson is wickedly fun as Azkadellia.  Alan Cumming shines as Glitch, and steals many scenes in this film.  Raoul Trujillo, who's known to fans of SciFi Channel's ""Frankenfish"" as Ricardo, displays solid emotion as the tortured Raw.  Richard Dreyfuss does an excellent, albeit brief, job as the Mystic Man.  Neal McDonough portrays the title character, and his performance begs the question as to why he hasn't broken out as a legitimate star in his own right.The special effects are very good for a made-for-TV story.  The music is above par as well.  Willing drives the story along at a solid pace, littering it with a nice blend of humor, suspense and action.  Fans of  L. Frank Baum's book and the classic film adaptation will see plenty of nods to both.The DVD's special features are okay, but nothing really stands out except for the interviews of the primary cast.  McDonough and Cumming provide the most interesting interviews.  There's a gag reel that's more of a silly documentary than actual goofs. There is also""On The Set With The Director,"" and ""Beyond The Yellow Brick Road,"" which gives the viewer a look behind the scenes.As a whole, SciFi Channel and co. have outdone themselves with this mini-series.  They acquired a solid cast, good special effects and excellent direction and produced a wonderful new vision of a classic tale.  Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and sci-fi as well as fans of children's fantasy tales.  There is a bit of language and some violence, but parents should feel safe letting their older kids (seven and up) watch this film with them.  Just be ready to ""cough"" when Azkadellia make a remark about D.G. and where she happens to be going.",4,A Wonderful Revisioning Of A Classic Story,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,2902,"['must', 'admit', 'was', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'revisioning', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'due', 'fact', 'were', 'heavily', 'promoting', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'years', '95', '%', 'films', 'television', 'series', 'music', 'heavily', 'hyped', 'usually', 'not', 'great', 'end', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'excellent', 'story', 'written', 'Craig', 'Van', 'Sickle', 'Steven', 'Long', 'Mitchell', 'tale', 'centers', 'D.G.', 'young', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'feel', 'hometown', 'parents', 'always', 'talk', 'better', 'times', 'town', 'otherworldly', 'Little', 'know', 'place', 'magical', 'mystical', 'O.Z', 'When', 'chased', 'tornado', 'D.G', 'world', 'where', 'wicked', 'Azkadellia', 'goons', 'including', 'flying', 'monkeys', 'are', 'retrieve', 'secret', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'way', 'D.G', 'group', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'goofy', 'Glitch', 'sensitive', 'Raw', 'standoffish', 'Cain', 'What', 'D.G', 'secret', 'Who', 'Mystic', 'Man', 'What', 'awaits', 'D.G', 'friends', 'Watch', 'Tin', 'Man', 'find', 'out.Directed', 'Nick', 'Willing', 'Tin', 'Man', 'excellent', 'cast', 'lovely', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'D.G', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'wickedly', 'fun', 'Azkadellia', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'shines', 'Glitch', 'steals', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'Raoul', 'Trujillo', 'who', 'known', 'fans', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'Frankenfish', 'Ricardo', 'solid', 'emotion', 'tortured', 'Raw', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'excellent', 'brief', 'job', 'Mystic', 'Man', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'title', 'character', 'performance', 'question', 'why', ""n't"", 'broken', 'out', 'legitimate', 'star', 'own', 'right.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'made-for-TV', 'story', 'music', 'above', 'par', 'as', 'well', 'Willing', 'story', 'along', 'solid', 'pace', 'littering', 'nice', 'blend', 'humor', 'suspense', 'action', 'Fans', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'book', 'classic', 'film', 'adaptation', 'will', 'see', 'plenty', 'nods', 'both.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'okay', 'nothing', 'really', 'out', 'interviews', 'primary', 'cast', 'McDonough', 'Cumming', 'provide', 'most', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'gag', 'reel', 'more', 'silly', 'documentary', 'actual', 'goofs', 'also', 'Set', 'Director', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'viewer', 'look', 'scenes.As', 'whole', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'co.', 'have', 'outdone', 'mini-series', 'acquired', 'solid', 'cast', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'excellent', 'direction', 'produced', 'wonderful', 'new', 'vision', 'classic', 'tale', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'sci-fi', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'children', 'fantasy', 'tales', 'bit', 'language', 'violence', 'parents', 'should', 'feel', 'safe', 'letting', 'older', 'kids', 'seven', 'up', 'watch', 'film', 'Just', 'be', 'ready', 'cough', 'when', 'Azkadellia', 'make', 'remark', 'D.G', 'where', 'be', 'going']",Tin Man

1127300,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B0010X744G,K. Reynolds,"[2, 2]","WE ALL KNOW the Tin Man is the guy looking for a heart. But in the three-part series broadcast on SyFy (formerly SciFi), we have ""...a team of characters missing parts who, as a group, complete each other,"" as Raoul Trujillo (Raw/Cowardly Lion) says in the making-of.Sounds a lot like the original, yes? Still, the overriding quest in this new take - from the Wicked Witch, Azkadellia (Kathleen Robertson) to D.G./Dorothy Gale (Zooey Deschanel) herself - the theme is finding heart as in love and courage.In a clever script from Steven Long Mitchell and Craig W. Van Sickle directed by Nick Willing, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" both book and film, have been filtered through a rusty steam punk lens for an exciting sci-fi twist. Gadgets made up of ancient office machines and what looks like Dr. Frankenstein's original set define the O.Z. or Outer Zone. The Scarecrow is now Glitch (Alan Cumming), once the most intelligent man in the universe, now a zipper-headed goofball in search of his missing brain. (Find it bottled in Dr. Frank's lab in  the W.W.'s industrialized castle.)D.G. - Dorothy - wears bootcut jeans and rides a motorcycle in old Kansas where she works as a waitress in a blue gingham apron. (Who wouldn't want leave that behind?) ToTo is a shape shifter. The Cowardly Lion - or Raw - has leonine characteristics and is a member of an empathic race, captured and used by the W.W. in order to glean secrets from her enemies.The Tin Man/Wyatt Cain (Neal McDonough) is an Old West style law enforcer complete with cool hat and six gun. He also rides a white horse. When introduced, Cain is found in a gruesome metal diving suit contraption, a device that continually replays the most horrific day of sustaining him physically. His heart is hardened by grief while the others are shattered, yet they band together to fight the evil that has overtaken the O.Z.That would be the gorgeous Wicked Witch who dresses in extreme, body sculpting style - golden body armour, leather, satin  - and whose flying bat monkeys come to life through tattoos inscribed on her cleavage.Visually, ""Tin Man"" is a treat with all its imaginative characters, costumes and sets. Effects are not always the best. Those flying monkeys, for example, are sometimes painfully rendered. Some efforts, such as the green house and double eclipse, look amateurish. However, it all blends in well with the story; color and detail are movie quality, especially in high-def. A stereo soundtrack sounds good; viewers will enjoy re-watching and listening for classic Oz references. An original score by Simon Boswell has a lush, almost classic sound.Extras are carried over from the DVD collector's edition and make lively viewing once the series concludes. The best would be ""Beyond the Yellow Brick Road: The Making of Tin Man,"" a detailed behind-scenes exploration with interviews from cast and crew. This is a film adults can enjoy on their own or together with young ones. It might even make a decent, two-night double feature with the classic ""Wizard of Oz"" - or pair it with Nick Willing's most recent SyFy homage, ""Alice,"" a reboot of ""Alice in Wonderland.""",5,Steam punk O.Z. exceeds expectations,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,3133,"['WE', 'ALL', 'KNOW', 'Tin', 'Man', 'guy', 'looking', 'heart', 'three-part', 'series', 'broadcast', 'SyFy', 'formerly', 'SciFi', 'have', 'team', 'characters', 'missing', 'parts', 'who', 'group', 'complete', 'other', 'Raoul', 'Trujillo', 'Raw/Cowardly', 'Lion', 'making-of.Sounds', 'lot', 'original', 'yes', 'Still', 'overriding', 'quest', 'new', 'take', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'Azkadellia', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'D.G./Dorothy', 'Gale', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'theme', 'finding', 'heart', 'love', 'courage.In', 'clever', 'script', 'Steven', 'Long', 'Mitchell', 'Craig', 'W.', 'Van', 'Sickle', 'directed', 'Nick', 'Willing', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'book', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'filtered', 'rusty', 'steam', 'punk', 'lens', 'exciting', 'sci-fi', 'twist', 'Gadgets', 'made', 'ancient', 'office', 'machines', 'what', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', 'original', 'set', 'define', 'O.Z', 'Outer', 'Zone', 'Scarecrow', 'now', 'Glitch', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'once', 'most', 'intelligent', 'man', 'universe', 'now', 'zipper-headed', 'goofball', 'search', 'missing', 'brain', 'bottled', 'Dr.', 'Frank', 'lab', 'W.W.', 'industrialized', 'castle.', 'D.G', 'Dorothy', 'wears', 'bootcut', 'jeans', 'motorcycle', 'old', 'Kansas', 'where', 'waitress', 'blue', 'gingham', 'apron', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'ToTo', 'shape', 'shifter', 'Cowardly', 'Lion', 'Raw', 'leonine', 'characteristics', 'member', 'empathic', 'race', 'captured', 'used', 'W.W.', 'order', 'glean', 'secrets', 'enemies.The', 'Tin', 'Man/Wyatt', 'Cain', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'Old', 'West', 'style', 'law', 'enforcer', 'complete', 'cool', 'hat', 'six', 'gun', 'also', 'white', 'horse', 'When', 'introduced', 'Cain', 'found', 'gruesome', 'metal', 'diving', 'suit', 'contraption', 'device', 'continually', 'most', 'horrific', 'day', 'sustaining', 'physically', 'heart', 'hardened', 'grief', 'others', 'are', 'shattered', 'yet', 'band', 'together', 'fight', 'evil', 'overtaken', 'O.Z.That', 'would', 'be', 'gorgeous', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'who', 'extreme', 'body', 'sculpting', 'style', 'golden', 'body', 'armour', 'leather', 'satin', 'flying', 'bat', 'monkeys', 'come', 'life', 'tattoos', 'inscribed', 'cleavage.Visually', 'Tin', 'Man', 'treat', 'imaginative', 'characters', 'costumes', 'sets', 'Effects', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'flying', 'monkeys', 'example', 'are', 'sometimes', 'painfully', 'rendered', 'efforts', 'such', 'green', 'house', 'double', 'eclipse', 'look', 'amateurish', 'However', 'blends', 'well', 'story', 'color', 'detail', 'are', 'movie', 'quality', 'especially', 'high-def', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'viewers', 'will', 'enjoy', 're-watching', 'listening', 'classic', 'Oz', 'references', 'original', 'score', 'Simon', 'Boswell', 'lush', 'almost', 'classic', 'sound.Extras', 'are', 'carried', 'DVD', 'collector', 'edition', 'make', 'lively', 'viewing', 'once', 'series', 'best', 'would', 'be', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'Making', 'Tin', 'Man', 'detailed', 'behind-scenes', 'exploration', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'film', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'own', 'together', 'young', 'ones', 'might', 'even', 'make', 'decent', 'two-night', 'double', 'feature', 'classic', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'pair', 'Nick', 'Willing', 'most', 'recent', 'SyFy', 'homage', 'Alice', 'reboot', 'Alice', 'Wonderland']",Tin Man

It stars Zooey Deschanel (as D.G.), Neal McDonough (as Cain, the Tin Man), Alan Cumming (as Glitch, the Scarecrow) and Raoul Trujillo (as Raw, the Lion).  It is based upon the Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum but adds a lot of fantasy and science fiction and takes many, many liberties.  The characters are based on Wizard of Oz characters and the land is the O.Z. (Outer Zone).At the beginning of the series, we meet DG, a teenage waitress in Kansas that is tiring of her life there, feels that there is something that makes her different from the people that she works and lives with (even though she can't put her finger on exactly what) and is haunted by dreams of a woman with lavender eyes telling her that a storm is brewing. And a storm does come - Azkadellia (played by Kathleen Robertson), aka the Wicked Witch - sends a troop of her long coat policemen to kidnap DG and bring her back to the O.Z. DG escapes by jumping into the travel storm that brought the longcoats to Kansas and meets, in short order, Wyatt Cain, Glitch and Raw in the O.Z. The troop learns that Azkadellia is searching for an emerald with which to permanently cause the O.Z. to become dark and that D.G. inherited that knowledge when DG's mother revived her after Azkadellia killed DG using dark magic. Therefore, DG is the key to Azkadellia's success. The group then begins a search to find the Mystic Man (played by Richard Dreyfuss) in the hopes of stopping Azkadellia from ruining the Outer Zone.I had high hopes for this movie/mini-series. The concept was very promising - an updated, edgier version of the saccharine movie and children's book that we all know. And in some ways it delivered, but in some ways it did not.  I really liked Zooey Deschanel - she totally redefined Dorothy and was just fun.  McDonough was appropriately cast as the Tin Man, as was Alan Cumming as the Scarecrow. I didn't like the Tin Man though at all, the character was just too two dimensional. He was driven too much by cynicism.

Then I started reading things on the Sci-Fi website about it and thought, what a minute, where are the little people, the wicked witch, the flying monkees?  Ok, so they kept the flying monkees but they took the liberty to do an entirely different show and went an entirely different direction that I ever would have thought possible.  I TIVO'd the mini-series and decided to wait until all three nights were taped so I could watch them all at once because I know me, once I get hooked I can't wait for the next episode, by the way, SETTLE THE WRITERS STRIKE, PLEASE!  OK with that being said, I found this mini-series well WRITTEN (writers), well acted, and directed.

It is a remake of the Wizard of Oz story; supposedly set several generations after the original Judy Garland version of the Wizard of Oz.  As a remake, many things have changed.  First of, Dorothy is not a blond-haired, blue-eyed prudish girl.  Instead, we have DG, a disillusioned tomboyish teenager with black hair and a subtle ""whatever"" attitude.  She is transported to the OZ (short for Outer Zone) by a tornado, but once there the story is very different.  She does meet a tin man, who is actually a local sheriff.  There is a cowardly lion, though with very impressive powers, and instead of a scarecrow, we have a lobotomized scientist with hidden martial arts skills.This OZ does have a wicked witch, though instead of old and ugly, she is actually a hot babe who dresses provocatively.  Like the original version, there is a great secret revealed, though here it relates to the wicked witch.  I personally like this story better as it is very original, with none of the traditional cliches.  So I give this a 5/5 stars for the storyline.However, the execution could have been better.  The audio and visual effects were all believable, and the cinematography was good.  What was lacking was the costumes.  For a land far far away, all the good guys wore dresses similar to what Americans wore during the 1940s and 50s.  And the witch's henchman dress eerily like Nazis.  So lack of innovation in the costume.  The soundtrack is also quite repetitive, and seems better suited for trailer music.  A movie like this deserves a full blown orchestral score.  So for execution, I give this movie 3/5 stars.My final disappointment was the lack of subtitles.  Overall, a good movie and worth the time to watch it.

1127318,APHX2A37KDRAH,B0010X744G,N. Trachta,"[4, 4]","Tin Man was a Sci Fi Channel mini-series where a more modern look is taken of Frank Baums The Wizard of Oz.  As with the original, the main character is a young lady from Kansas, rather than going by the name Dorothy though, she's called DG.  Also rather than being the cheerful girl who sings us along the Yellow Brick Road we have a young lady who's a little darker and feeling she's missing something in her life.  Btw, for those not familiar, OZ in this telling is short for Outer Zone.The GoodI loved the Tin Man character.  Neal McDonough does a very good job showing us a man with heart and I also loved the setup for why he's that way.  Alan Cumming does a good job as Glitch (the Scarecrow), and I enjoyed Kathleen Robertson (the wicked witch) and Zooey Deschanel (DG)in the first portion of the movie.  Also, Richard Dryfus does a great job as the Mystic Man (the Wizard).  Very interesting...Story wise I loved the set up for the characters.  The background for DG, Glitch, Tin Man and Raw (the Lion) are interesting.  I also found myself interested in DG's family background, the relationship to the Wicked Witch, and also the relationship between this telling of the Wizard of Oz and the original (very nicely done when DG meets Dorothy Gale).  The other big plus is showing  OZ as being a dark place.  This was best shown with Central City.The BadThe worst bad was the bad guys.  Zero was a Zero.  The bad guys were incompetent and you almost have the feeling that if it weren't for the flying monkeys that DG and the rest would have walked away with everything.  In the story telling department part 2 dragged a little.  Some movements in the story were abrupt; others weren't finished very well because they chose to follow the stereotype.  The worst part of this is when we go from the Central City to the Ice Palace on the Northern Island and DG meets her sister and becomes her prisoner.  Other weaknesses included Raw and his kind; while nice it just didn't sell as well as it might have; and the bad guys equipment.  A surplus M-3 halftrack, an armored car, and some guys running around in dusters with firearms just didn't impress me.  If the director would have dropped the WWII surplus and the dusters it might have been better.Special FeaturesThese were lacking to put it simply.  Yes they have interviews with the director (in about three different versions) but nothing that moved me.  I was looking for cut scenes, wardrobe, and there one called Bloopers I was expecting Bloopers rather than looking at the behind the scene staff.The RatingI'll call this one 3.5 stars.  I enjoyed the setup but the middle part almost put me to sleep.  I do admire the effort that was done with this and I do believe the director should have had a real shot at a true mini-series (three episodes isn't enough.  1 or 2 more would have been better for the story).  That said, I don't believe this is truly 4 star material.  It's enjoyable and I'll watch it again but it's not something that will draw me to it on a regular bases.",3,A good modern look at the Wizard of Oz,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,3038,"['Tin', 'Man', 'was', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'mini-series', 'where', 'more', 'modern', 'look', 'taken', 'Frank', 'Baums', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'original', 'main', 'character', 'young', 'lady', 'Kansas', 'rather', 'going', 'name', 'Dorothy', 'called', 'DG', 'Also', 'rather', 'being', 'cheerful', 'girl', 'who', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'have', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'little', 'darker', 'feeling', 'missing', 'something', 'life', 'Btw', 'not', 'familiar', 'OZ', 'telling', 'short', 'Outer', 'Zone.The', 'GoodI', 'loved', 'Tin', 'Man', 'character', 'McDonough', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'man', 'heart', 'also', 'loved', 'setup', 'why', 'way', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'good', 'job', 'Glitch', 'Scarecrow', 'enjoyed', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'wicked', 'witch', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'DG', 'first', 'portion', 'movie', 'Also', 'Richard', 'Dryfus', 'great', 'job', 'Mystic', 'Man', 'Wizard', 'Very', 'interesting', 'Story', 'wise', 'loved', 'set', 'up', 'characters', 'background', 'DG', 'Glitch', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Raw', 'Lion', 'are', 'interesting', 'also', 'found', 'interested', 'DG', 'family', 'background', 'relationship', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'also', 'relationship', 'telling', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'original', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'when', 'DG', 'Dorothy', 'Gale', 'other', 'big', 'showing', 'OZ', 'being', 'dark', 'place', 'was', 'best', 'shown', 'Central', 'City.The', 'BadThe', 'worst', 'bad', 'was', 'bad', 'guys', 'Zero', 'was', 'Zero', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'incompetent', 'almost', 'have', 'feeling', 'were', ""n't"", 'flying', 'monkeys', 'DG', 'rest', 'would', 'have', 'walked', 'away', 'everything', 'story', 'telling', 'department', 'part', '2', 'dragged', 'little', 'movements', 'story', 'were', 'abrupt', 'others', 'were', ""n't"", 'finished', 'very', 'well', 'chose', 'follow', 'stereotype', 'worst', 'part', 'when', 'go', 'Central', 'City', 'Ice', 'Palace', 'Northern', 'Island', 'DG', 'sister', 'prisoner', 'Other', 'weaknesses', 'included', 'Raw', 'kind', 'nice', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'have', 'bad', 'guys', 'equipment', 'surplus', 'M-3', 'halftrack', 'armored', 'car', 'guys', 'running', 'around', 'dusters', 'firearms', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'impress', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'dropped', 'WWII', 'surplus', 'dusters', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better.Special', 'FeaturesThese', 'were', 'lacking', 'put', 'simply', 'Yes', 'have', 'interviews', 'director', 'about', 'three', 'different', 'versions', 'nothing', 'moved', 'was', 'looking', 'cut', 'scenes', 'wardrobe', 'there', 'one', 'called', 'Bloopers', 'was', 'expecting', 'Bloopers', 'rather', 'looking', 'scene', 'staff.The', 'RatingI', ""'ll"", 'call', 'one', '3.5', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'setup', 'middle', 'part', 'almost', 'put', 'sleep', 'do', 'admire', 'effort', 'was', 'done', 'do', 'believe', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'real', 'shot', 'true', 'mini-series', 'three', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'enough', '1', '2', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'story', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'truly', '4', 'star', 'material', 'enjoyable', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'draw', 'regular', 'bases']",Tin Man

1127329,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0010X744G,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[2, 2]","""Tin Man"" is an interesting specimen of a mini-series. Based on the ""Wizard of Oz"" books by L. Frank Baum, I was initially under the impression that this was either a contemporary version of the 1939 movie or a revisionist treatment of the original children's book. Then once the film started, I realized that it was a complete re-imagining of the subject matter, in which familiar aspects of the book and movie had been redesigned in a sort of ""alternative Oz"", now called the O.Z. (short for Outer Zone). Then, in the third installment of the film, ""Tin Man"" changes again, and is revealed to be a sequel, with direct mention - and even a cameo appearance - by Dorothy Gale herself. As such, ""Tin Man"" defies any attempts to classify it. But that is only fitting considering the source material, which been involved in a range of retellings over the years, fromThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 100th Anniversary Edition (Books of Wonder), toThe Wizard of Oz, toReturn to OztoWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (Harper Fiction)to the stage-show spectacular. I also recall watching an animated cartoon on Saturday mornings based on Oz.As such, I'm hesitant to give away too much of the plot for ""Tin Man"". Coming into this movie completely cold as to what to expect, half the fun was watching it all unexpectedly unfold. Basically, a young woman called DG is swept away (literally) from her life as a small-town waitress and into a world with which she feels a strange affinity.Picking up her own versions of the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, DG begins to traverse this strange new world on a variety of quests - for her parents, for answers, for the wizard, for memories, for her captive friends, for emeralds, for the struggle against evil...for a lot of things actually. As it turns out, the O.Z. is under the ever-growing control of the evil sorceress Azkadelia (give a girl a name like that, and how do you expect her to turn out?) who has the usual plans to take over the world with the help of a doomsday machine that only needs one last McGuffin to activate its power.If you're sensing a healthy amount of snark in these opening paragraphs, that's because the first half-hour or so of this sprawling mini-series is difficult to warm up to. DG wears a blue-and-white gingham waitress uniform and stands momentarily in a beam of sunlight (cue eye roll). The first inhabitants of the O.Z. she meets are midgets dressed as...turkeys? I guess they were this version's idea of the Munchkins, but as members of a secret resistance hiding out in the forest, I'm not sure why they decided to dress themselves up in feathers and colourful war-paint.Azkadelia is every clich&eacute;d villain you've ever seen rolled into one. She stomps around in a dominatrix outfit, cursing and pouting, and doing things like killing inept henchmen and telling the next in line that: ""you've just been promoted."" Even worse, there are tattoos on her cleavage that turn into this adaptation's version of the winged-monkeys...in order to release them she sheds her outer-garment and thrusts her breasts toward the camera.I was about to switch it off, but then all of a sudden...it got better! Most of the interest of the story is contained within the twists and turns concerning DG's discovery of the world and its connection with her own past, ultimately making this a story about a long-separated family trying to reunite. There's more to Azkadelia than some gold latex and an evil hairdo, as we find in her tragic back-story that gives her evil acts a purpose. And our three companions: Glitch, Cain and Raw, as the respective Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion, each get their own sub-plots that work well in the context of the over-arching tale. Furthermore, it's fun to see the creators playing around with the source material, such as a new rendering of the Yellow Brick Road, the reinterpretation of the Wizard as a ""Mystic Man"" who is perpetually high on vapours, or the literal use of a ""tin man"" in corporeal punishment, all providing echoes of the familiar story.This is particularly true when you realize that this is the Oz of the future, taking place many years after the events that we know of in Baum's original story. What with its vaguely steam-punk, retro, mechanical atmosphere, it's easy to believe that this is an Oz that has evolved from our original understanding of that world, with the same blend of Old World resonance and newfangled technology that was present in the book. Sadly, they skipped the opportunity to add in a few details of Baum's book that have not yet made it to the screen, such as the talking field mice or the city of china people...but hey, you can't have it all.Acting is also a mixed bag. As the protagonist, Zooey Deschanel relies on a droll, cynical tone which mostly works in her favour, but sometimes comes off a little strange. In a critical moment when her life as she knows it is turned completely on its head, she responds with sarcasm and exasperation. It rings rather false. However, her casual demeanor does serve to ground the film, and really - who could resist those big blue eyes? Neal McDonough gets the most attention as the titular Tin Man of the title, and plays his part well, but the real stand-out is Alan Cummings as Glitch, who manages to be both comedic and poignant in his portrayal of a man who has lost the greater part of himself and mournful of his awareness of this loss. There's a reason why Dorothy told the Scarecrow she'd miss him most of all, and Cummings reminds us why.However, some of the acting, particularly among the supporting characters, is sub-par. I won't name names; suffice to say, you'll know it (and wince at it) when you see it. It's always frustrating when an expensive and generally well-made production is bought down by a lack of talent in its cast. Likewise, some of the special effects are very good, usually the rendering of the scenery and the cyclone, whereas others are awful - the CGI feeders for example.As many have already noted, this is not for kids, as there are several sexual situations, violent scenes and coarse language. There's nothing inherently wrong with having such things when the need arises, but in this case there's little reason for it except in the attempt to darken things up. Parents would be reluctant to share this with their kids, and that's a shame considering some of the trite dialogue seems as though it was specifically written for children. It's like they're not quite sure who their audience is.And of course, what would an adaptation like this be without an array of in-jokes, references and winks to the audience? As such, prepare for police-officers called ""Gulch"" and kids who remind each other to watch out for lions, tigers and bears *oh my!* When DG is asked: ""Had that nightmare again?"" She replies: ""In Technicolour,"" and variations of things like ""Have a heart,"" ""I've lost my marbles"" and ""Show some back-bone,"" are oft-repeated (guess what characters they refer to. Go on, guess). And that's just off the top of my head. As with everything else, some work, some don't.On the whole, I enjoyed myself. Though it's very long, the story moves at a brisk state, and the production design is beautiful - definitely eye-candy as far as I'm concerned. I'd recommend it, just so long as you know what you're getting into before you start watching: as ""Tin Man"" is almost certainly not what you'd expect!",4,"""I Haven't Been Here Before...But I Know

1127348,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0010X744G,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","Several years ago, the SyFy channel decided to take a crack at re-inventing the classic Wizard of Oz, a noble task, that many have tried and failed. I didn't know what to expect, but I assumed it would be some variation of the classic tale, hoping it would be more the like books and less like the films. Tin Man is defiantly not for kids and takes a unique approach to the classic story. In this version, OZ is not the friendly loveable place with strange characters and happy times for all. It's a dark story, about a dark place, where presently there is a lot of pain and misery. The big twist in the story is that this OZ is centuries past the one visited by Dorothy Gale. In the Outer Zone (O.Z.), Dorothy Gale is a revered as the start of the royal families bloodline, but she has been dead for centuries! That being said, quite ingeniously, the future residents of the O.Z. parallel the old story, but not because they have to, they are in a sense mocking the original story in subtle ways. There's D.G. (Zooey Deschanel), the girl from the other side, who was forced into the O.Z., with no memory of ever having been there before. She soon meets Glitch, (Alan Cummings) a man who had part of his brain removed for disobeying the Queen. As they try to figure out what is happening around them, they run into a man (Neal McDonough) being punished in a Tin Man suit. This man was a Cop or Tin Man in the O.Z. who was deemed a threat, and put into this horrible form of torture. Finally, they come to the rescue of a native healer, named Raw (Raoul Trujillo), who has become trapped by carnivores and is about to become dinner. Together they go to see the wise man, to find out how to proceed in helping D.G. The Wise Man (Richard Dreyfuss) turns out to be a drugged out magician doing parlor tricks! There are a million other parallels to the original story that make the journey through the O.Z. that much more enjoyable. Zooey Deschanel is the star and even though people often mistake her unique style of acting for inexperience, she was the perfect choice to play D.G. The other standout is veteran character actor, Neal McDonough, who gives a gut wrenching and strong performance as the tortured former cop, in search of his family. The rest of the supporting cast was equally as impressive, taking you through the full range of emotions. As I said before, this is certainly not the OZ you grew up with and it's certainly not what I expected. Everything from the special effects, to the story, and even the modernization, was extremely impressive. It really is a shame that this was only a three part mini-series, but this would have made for one hell of a regular series. Some of the parallels are obvious, but there were plenty of times where I legitimately forgot that I was watching The Wizard of Oz.

I have seen Zooey in other movies and have felt that her deadpan characters were charming and worked for the most part in other movies.

1127353,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0010X744G,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[13, 14]","For many people, THE WIZARD OF OZ is one of their favorite films of all time.  Frank L. Baum's original story became a hugely popular and critical success not long after it was published and the story of the THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ and over 100 years later is still popular and hugely influential (look at the massive success of the musical WICKED). Despite this, nowadays many people have never read the original story or books that Baum wrote.  If they had they would begin to see that Oz isn't necessarily the bright and always cheerful place that the 1939 pictured.  Oz was a fantastical place, but like in all fairy tales, evil and darkness is lurking in the shadows.  Just take the flying monkeys.  Many people think that monkeys are cute and sometimes they are.  But monkeys are also very cruel creatures that like to play with their own feces and can be quite vicious and the idea of monkeys that can fly and are large enough to lift a lion is very frightening.  There's all kinds of creatures like that in Oz, proving that beneath the glitter Oz can be a very scary place, indeed, and a modern update of the tale would make for a spectacular movie.Thus, the Sci-Fi Channel stepped in and updated the story with the airing of TIN MAN in December 2007.  TIN MAN follows a young woman named DG (Zooey Deschanel).  DG is living in rural Kansas.  She works as a waitress at the local diner in town, rides a motorcycle, keeps getting chased around by Police Officer Gulch, and dreams of moving to a different place and living a more exciting life.  DG is a fantastic artist and great mechanic. She also starts having bad dreams that start to occur more and more frequently.  Late one night DG is awaken by a giant tornado, with a group of armed men in long coats, headed towards the family farmhouse.  Before she can really understand what is happening DG is being chased by the men in long coats and is pushed by her parents into the twister and taken to a completely different world, the O.Z. She undergoes a series of adventures and is joined in her quest to find her parents by a man who has had his brain taken out and has a zipper on his skull, a man who was locked in an iron suit for over a decade who used to be a police officer or ""Tin Man"", and a humanoid lion who has the gifts of healing and telepathy.I saw the advertisements for TIN MAN when it first aired, but was unable to watch the special. It's a shame because the mini-series became the single highest television event for the Sci-Fi Channel in their history.  After a former student recommend that I watch the series, I made sure to watch it when it aired again in March 2008 and later watched the DVD.  The overarching story is familiar, but the O.Z. is a much different and darker place than the Oz that people are probably familiar.  I found the story fascinating.  The film features a great cast of highly talented actors which gives the production a slightly higher level of creditability than many other Sci-Fi specials.  The special effects are spectacular and the score is riveting.With that said, there are a few weaknesses in the script. For instance, the timeframe that the story takes place incredible if not impossible and the whole idea of the flying monkeys being magical tattoos that fly off the wicked witch's chest is more than a bit unsettling.  I also was disappointed by the third part of the series.  The first two parts of the series were well plotted, but the third section is rushed and concludes rather abruptly.  The story would have been better if the final act was extended and more evenly paced with a satisfying epilogue.Still the TIN MAN is a great film. It updates the story of THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ without minimizing it and in fact extends the legend of Oz.  Also, unlike many others who have seen the film I think TIN MAN is perfectly suitable for most viewers, including children.  TIN MAN is a fairy tale.  Fairy tales are supposed to have an element of darkness and suspense in them because fairy tales are really about life and sad, dark, and scary things exist in life.  Besides, flying monkeys really don't exist and if they did we should all be scared of them anyway.Recommended for people who enjoy films with a good story, people who enjoy quality fantasy films, and people who have actually read some of the original Oz books,The DVD includes several extras including the making-of featurette ""Beyond the Yellow Brick Road--The Making of TIN MAN""; behind the scene footage of director Nick Willing; a blooper reel; interviews with Nick Willing, Alan Cumming, Neal McDonough, and Zooey Deschanel; the original TIN MAN trailer, and trailers for THE MIST and THE

Instead, it follows a parallel path, brushing closely at times, adamantly its own creature while maintaining respect for the beloved stories and movie that begot it.Taken by itself, it's a more-than-passable modern kind of fantasy - gritty, noir at times, boiling with unresolved tensions and unexplored strengths that give plenty of room for each character to expand. Visuals are strong, even if they tend to rely on icons more than new imagery, but that's a fair way to get time-bounded story telling up and running. And, there's plenty here to echo today's headlines: harsh interrogation, deep-cover agents, S/M overtones in the Evil Sorceress and her corsetry.

1127360,A19JDXB5R33C7R,B0010X744G,WryGuy2,"[1, 1]","""Tin Man"", a 3 part mini-series that aired on the Sci-Fi channel in 2007, is a re-imagining of the Wizard of Oz.  But unlike the classic 1939 movie, which despite its overtones of evil, was basically a bright and cheerful place, ""Tin Man"" is much darker and apocalyptic (and in a sense, truer to the novel by L. Frank Baum.)The story follows D.G., a young woman in Kansas who lives at home on a farm, working as a waitress in a local diner, and yearning for a more exciting life, one where she better fits in.  Without giving anything away, she is transported to the O.Z. (the Outer Zone) and meets up with updated versions of the tin man, cowardly lion, and scarecrow, who help her on her quests.  However, while giving the occasional nod to the 1939 film, the story and characters in ""Tin Man"" are basically brand new, and are entertaining and imaginative.For a miniseries, the special effects are quite good and very realistic.  The actors are, by and large, talented and fit well into their characters, especially Alan Cumming as Glitch (the scarecrow), and Neal McDonough as the Tin Man.  I had some problems with Zooey Deschanel's portrayal of DG, though.  While Ms Deschanel is extremely talented, I felt that the scope of her character's emotions was too limited and too bland, when greater passion and amazement would have been more appropriate.While I enjoyed the story as a whole, I also thought some of the dialog was a bit too stilted and/or trite at times, and that there were several holes in the plot that could have been better explained.  Again, without trying to give anything away, the evil witch has her purpose, but it's never really clear why she wants to do it, especially as the likely impact would be the end of the world.  The first two episodes were better in this regard, while the third (and final episode) felt a bit rushed.  I also would have liked a slightly longer and more conclusive ending after DG and company defeat the witch.Taken as a whole, though, this is a good miniseries.  It runs to about 4  hours of actual viewing time, and is well worth watching.  I liked how they turned the story of the Wizard of Oz inside out, along with the superior productions values, and how well the actors fit their roles.",4,Well Worth Watching,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,2247,"['Man', '3', 'part', 'mini-series', 'aired', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', '2007', 're-imagining', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'classic', '1939', 'movie', 'overtones', 'evil', 'was', 'basically', 'bright', 'cheerful', 'place', 'Tin', 'Man', 'much', 'darker', 'apocalyptic', 'sense', 'truer', 'novel', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'story', 'D.G.', 'young', 'woman', 'Kansas', 'who', 'home', 'farm', 'working', 'waitress', 'local', 'diner', 'yearning', 'more', 'exciting', 'life', 'one', 'where', 'better', 'fits', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'transported', 'O.Z', 'Outer', 'Zone', 'up', 'updated', 'versions', 'tin', 'man', 'cowardly', 'lion', 'scarecrow', 'who', 'help', 'quests', 'However', 'giving', 'occasional', 'nod', '1939', 'film', 'story', 'characters', 'Tin', 'Man', 'are', 'basically', 'brand', 'new', 'are', 'entertaining', 'imaginative.For', 'miniseries', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'realistic', 'actors', 'are', 'large', 'talented', 'fit', 'well', 'characters', 'especially', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Glitch', 'scarecrow', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'Tin', 'Man', 'had', 'problems', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'portrayal', 'DG', 'though', 'Ms', 'Deschanel', 'extremely', 'talented', 'felt', 'scope', 'character', 'emotions', 'was', 'too', 'limited', 'too', 'bland', 'when', 'greater', 'passion', 'amazement', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate.While', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'whole', 'also', 'thought', 'dialog', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'stilted', 'and/or', 'trite', 'times', 'were', 'several', 'holes', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'explained', 'Again', 'trying', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'evil', 'witch', 'purpose', 'never', 'really', 'clear', 'why', 'do', 'especially', 'likely', 'impact', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'world', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'better', 'regard', 'third', 'final', 'episode', 'felt', 'bit', 'rushed', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'slightly', 'longer', 'more', 'conclusive', 'ending', 'DG', 'company', 'defeat', 'witch.Taken', 'whole', 'though', 'good', 'miniseries', '4', 'hours', 'actual', 'viewing', 'time', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'liked', 'how', 'turned', 'story', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'out', 'superior', 'productions', 'values', 'how', 'well', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles']",Tin Man

1127362,AP3B615GM191G,B0010X744G,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","After reading the book ""Wicked"" and watching the TV miniseries ""Tin Man"", I can definitively say that the latter is a much more exciting experience than the former.While ""Wicked"" tries to fit itself into the Wizard of Oz cannon (and fails miserably in the process), ""Tin Man"" is more of a re-imagining of the Oz universe (think the 2001 version of ""Planet of the Apes"", but much better). A young girl named DG finds herself whisked away into a strange land called the Outer Zone, where she quickly meets a man who had his brain surgically removed (Glitch), a former police officer of the O.Z. Tin Man force (Cain), and a very hairy telepathic animal (Raw). The group, just trying to figure out what the heck is going on, is continually thwarted by Azkadelia, the evil ruler of the O.Z.Just from that brief description, it is clear that the key elements of the original ""Oz"" are in place, just a little stranger. However, where the series really succeeds is in its ability to mend both a tribute to ""Oz"", and creating its own unique storyline. Throughout the film, subtle little nods are given to the original cannon (think Superman Returns), while the main new protagonists embark on their own unique journey. Plus, by the end of the journey, the entire adventure actually finds its place quite nicely WITHIN the Oz cannon, not feeling pretentious (like ""Wicked"") or completely out of place.About the only ""problem"" with this series is its long runtime, which inevitably led to a few moments of tedium. All in all, though, this is fantastic Oz-related fiction that carves out its own little niche in the cannon material.",4,"Much Better ""Oz"" Fiction Than ""Wicked""",1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,1620,"['reading', 'book', 'Wicked', 'watching', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'Tin', 'Man', 'can', 'definitively', 'say', 'latter', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'experience', 'former.While', 'Wicked', 'tries', 'fit', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'cannon', 'miserably', 'process', 'Tin', 'Man', 'more', 're-imagining', 'Oz', 'universe', 'think', '2001', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'much', 'better', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'DG', 'whisked', 'away', 'strange', 'land', 'called', 'Outer', 'Zone', 'where', 'quickly', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'brain', 'surgically', 'removed', 'Glitch', 'former', 'police', 'officer', 'O.Z', 'Tin', 'Man', 'force', 'Cain', 'very', 'hairy', 'telepathic', 'animal', 'Raw', 'group', 'just', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'going', 'continually', 'thwarted', 'Azkadelia', 'evil', 'ruler', 'O.Z.Just', 'brief', 'description', 'clear', 'key', 'elements', 'original', 'Oz', 'are', 'place', 'just', 'little', 'stranger', 'However', 'where', 'series', 'really', 'ability', 'mend', 'tribute', 'Oz', 'creating', 'own', 'unique', 'storyline', 'film', 'subtle', 'little', 'nods', 'are', 'given', 'original', 'cannon', 'think', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'main', 'new', 'protagonists', 'embark', 'own', 'unique', 'journey', 'end', 'journey', 'entire', 'adventure', 'actually', 'place', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Oz', 'cannon', 'not', 'feeling', 'pretentious', 'Wicked', 'completely', 'place.About', 'only', 'problem', 'series', 'long', 'runtime', 'inevitably', 'led', 'few', 'moments', 'tedium', 'though', 'fantastic', 'Oz-related', 'fiction', 'out', 'own', 'little', 'niche', 'cannon', 'material']",Tin Man
