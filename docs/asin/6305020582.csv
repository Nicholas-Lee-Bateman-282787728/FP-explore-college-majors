444444,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305020582,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 6]","The Bride With White Hair 2 followed quickly upon the success of the original movie, taking up the tragic story of Cho Yi-Hang (Leslie Cheung) and his forbidden love Lien Ni-Chang (Brigitte Lin).  By betraying his sacred pledge that he would never doubt his beloved, Cho has unleashed a monster.  Ni-Chang's fury over Cho's betrayal drives her completely mad, transforming her into the white-haired witch who lives only to destroy every living member of the Eight Clans, especially the Wu Tang clan to which Cho belongs.  As for Cho, he has retreated to Mount Shin Fung, guarding over a mystical flower whose bloom (and it only blooms once every twenty years) can cleanse and restore the woman he still loves.Ten years have passed since the deadly night that Ni-Chang went mad and almost single-handedly destroyed the Wu Tang clan.  Only two members of the clan survive: Cho, who has stood guard at Mount Shin Fung under blizzard conditions all these years, and Cho's nephew Kit (Sunny Chan).  With Kit's impending marriage to Lyre (Joey Maan), the opportunity to further the bloodline exists - and so it is that Ni-Chang crashes the party, kidnaps the young bride, and takes her back to her own private castle full of man-hating, deadly women.  There, Lyre is indoctrinated in the witch's ""See a man, kill a man"" philosophy and programmed to kill Kit with her own hands.The Eight Clans send their best warriors to try and kill the witch and rescue Lyre, but they are all almost defenseless against Ni-Chang, who uses her deadly hair as a most effective weapon (sounds weird, I know, but it works really well).  It soon becomes clear that the only person who might be able to defeat the white witch is Cho Yi-Hang, and this sets the stage for a most unforgettable reunion between the two former lovers.This sequel is a more direct, action-oriented film than the original The Bride With White Hair, and for that reason I actually found it more enjoyable on the surface.  Still, though, it lacks the depth and beauty of the original, largely because the two lovers do not meet again face to face until the final scene - although that meeting is well worth the wait.  Most certainly, if you've seen and enjoyed the original, you'll want to experience this sequel.",4,A lovers' reunion you won't want to miss,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,2260,"['Bride', 'White', 'Hair', '2', 'followed', 'quickly', 'success', 'original', 'movie', 'taking', 'up', 'tragic', 'story', 'Cho', 'Yi-Hang', 'Leslie', 'Cheung', 'forbidden', 'love', 'Lien', 'Ni-Chang', 'Brigitte', 'Lin', 'betraying', 'sacred', 'pledge', 'would', 'never', 'doubt', 'beloved', 'Cho', 'unleashed', 'monster', 'Ni-Chang', 'fury', 'Cho', 'betrayal', 'completely', 'mad', 'transforming', 'white-haired', 'witch', 'who', 'only', 'destroy', 'living', 'member', 'Eight', 'Clans', 'especially', 'Wu', 'Tang', 'clan', 'Cho', 'Cho', 'retreated', 'Mount', 'Shin', 'Fung', 'guarding', 'over', 'mystical', 'flower', 'bloom', 'only', 'once', 'twenty', 'years', 'can', 'cleanse', 'restore', 'woman', 'still', 'loves.Ten', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'deadly', 'night', 'Ni-Chang', 'went', 'mad', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'destroyed', 'Wu', 'Tang', 'clan', 'Only', 'two', 'members', 'clan', 'survive', 'Cho', 'who', 'stood', 'guard', 'Mount', 'Shin', 'Fung', 'blizzard', 'conditions', 'years', 'Cho', 'nephew', 'Kit', 'Sunny', 'Chan', 'Kit', 'impending', 'marriage', 'Lyre', 'Joey', 'Maan', 'opportunity', 'further', 'bloodline', 'Ni-Chang', 'party', 'young', 'bride', 'back', 'own', 'private', 'castle', 'full', 'man-hating', 'deadly', 'women', 'Lyre', 'indoctrinated', 'witch', 'See', 'man', 'kill', 'man', 'philosophy', 'programmed', 'kill', 'Kit', 'own', 'hands.The', 'Eight', 'Clans', 'send', 'best', 'warriors', 'try', 'kill', 'witch', 'rescue', 'Lyre', 'are', 'almost', 'defenseless', 'Ni-Chang', 'who', 'deadly', 'hair', 'most', 'effective', 'weapon', 'sounds', 'weird', 'know', 'really', 'well', 'soon', 'clear', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'defeat', 'white', 'witch', 'Cho', 'Yi-Hang', 'stage', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'reunion', 'two', 'former', 'lovers.This', 'sequel', 'more', 'direct', 'action-oriented', 'film', 'original', 'Bride', 'White', 'Hair', 'reason', 'actually', 'found', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'surface', 'Still', 'depth', 'beauty', 'original', 'largely', 'two', 'lovers', 'do', 'not', 'meet', 'again', 'face', 'face', 'final', 'scene', 'meeting', 'well', 'wait', 'Most', 'certainly', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'original', ""'ll"", 'want', 'experience', 'sequel']",The Bride With White Hair 2

Poor Brigitte Lin really mopes around in this film. Even in her depressed state, Brigitte is stunningly lovely. Christy Chung's role was amusing. I think the actors did their best with the script. As a huge Brigitte Lin and Leslie Cheung fan, it's still a good movie.

The movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married.  Enter the Bride.  She of course doesn't want anybody to be happy so...The story is not really worth going over, it is just injected and there are no real emotions.  Except of course for an ending that really PO'ed me.  The only reason this movie gets a 2 stars and almost gets a 3 is for Christy Chung.  Not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth, she is a great actress.  So I know of 2 movies now that are only worth watching for her, this and Red Wolf.

The plotline involves the Bride kidnapping another bridge, brainwashing her into trying to kill her fiance and fighting. Lots of fighting. The fiance is helped by his grandmother (who does kung fu better than anyone) and his female friend who is jealous of the whole arrangement but loyal to a fault.And this also has the best payoff to the requisite canto-pop montage. It was also the first time I ever laughed aloud at the ""this is a work of fiction, any resemblence to anyone living or dead is purely coincidental"" tag at the end.Beyond that, Leslie Cheung and Bridgett Lin do reunite at the end and it is wonderful, but the real story ended with the first movie.
