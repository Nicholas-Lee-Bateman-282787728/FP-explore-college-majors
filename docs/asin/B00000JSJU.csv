There are 3 seemingly unrelated plots.An American war veteran travels to Ho Chi Minh City to look for a daughter he fathered during the war.Kien An, a young woman, takes a job harvesting lotuses in the ponds of Teacher Dao, a reclusive man who has leprosy. Her singing awakens him from depression, and he asks her to write down poetry he has composed.The main story, is that about a cyclo driver, Hai, who stalks a prostitute after he had rescued her from a couple of thugs. He falls in love with her, wins a cyclo race, buys a night with her, treats her when she is ill and finally gets her back to school.The plots are very simple, predictable or even simplistic. There is only one truly happy ending - the story of the cyclo driver and the prostitute. The beauty lies in the way the scenes are shot.

508111,A2WP23WKNP4TFN,B00000JSJU,Christopher Bonds,"[15, 15]","This film is really four stories in one. Two of them seem to carry greater weight: Kien An, a young woman with a beautiful voice, catches the ear of her employer, Teacher Dao, a poet afflicted with leprosy living in a home or sanatorium in the middle of a lake full of lotus blossoms, which his employees pick and sell in the public market. In a series of moving exchanges, she learns that he no longer writes because the disease has taken away his fingers. She offers to become his scribe; he accepts. Only later, as he nears death, do we learn the significance of the song she sang, which so captivated him.Hai, a cyclo driver with a heart and mind, falls in love with Lan, a beautiful prostitute who fears emotional involvement. As their relationship progresses we come to know them as complex human beings. Their final scene together is beautifully filmed in an unforgettable setting of falling red leaves.Woody, a street urchin, touches the heart as he moves through the rainy streets looking like a small ghost in his plastic rain poncho. Someone has stolen his case of contraband goods (US Marine lighters, watches, etc) and he has been told not to return until he gets it back. In the process he finds a new friend.Keitel plays an ex-marine who is looking for the daughter he fathered during the war. Although his role is much smaller than the advertising would lead you to believe, he turns in a fine, ultimately moving performance in which facial expressions tell the story far better than words. (This is true of the whole film, in fact.)In a larger sense, one might say that this film is about the search for meaning in an increasingly plastic and temporal society--represented by plastic, scented lotuses, Lan's heavy call-girl makeup, the bar scenes. I trust the authority of the Vietnamese reviewer who said it accurately portrays postwar Vietnamese society as well.The things I like about this film are: Cinematography, acting, understatement, humanity, and (ultimately) optimism for the future.

Each glides in a separate small boat in the beautiful lotus pond and there is beauty and peace as they sing as they work.

508123,A30ZPSYOGFJXR6,B00000JSJU,Manola Sommerfeld,"[5, 6]","I'd pay money to watch a Doritos commercial if i knew Harvey Keitel was going to be on it.  That was the reason i rented this movie.  It kills me, though, that film distributors in this country feel they need to stick a photo of a famous actor or actress on the cover so that the movie sells, and this is regardless of how minimal their role is.  Harvey Keitel is not the star of this movie, yet you would never know that by looking at the video box.  I fell for that same thing once with &quot;Flirting&quot;, an Australian movie with Nicole Kidman all over the cover.  She actually had a very minimal part in the film, while the main characters are set in the background of the photo.But i digress: Three Seasons is a beautiful movie, vignette-style, where the paths of a few characters barely touch at times.  There are four basic stories.  The movie starts with the lotus blossom pickers, among whom there is this beautiful young woman who sings a touching poem while she works.  The owner of the lotus pond is a famous poet who has leprosy and lives hidden from the world.  After listening to the young woman, the poet summons her up and develops a beautiful and touching relationship with her.  Another story is the one of the rickshaw driver who falls in love with a prostitute, and shows her the true meaning of love.  Another story is the one starring Harvey Keitel.  He goes back to Vietnam searching for a daughter he has never met.  When he finally finds her, his heart is broken.  Finally, there is the story of two little panhandlers (and when i say little i really mean it: the boy was maybe 8, but the girl couldn't have been more than 5) and their troubles trying to survive in a harsh land.

She was entranced with it, watching the scenes to see what she could recognize; and she did recognize much from her childhood.  All of the stories portrayed in  this movie are very accurate.  The only weak part of the movie was the  character that Harvey Keitel played.  Something wasn't developed enough  there...too many blanks and spaces.  I think the movie demonstrated that  we, as human beings, do what we have to do and not always whether we want  to or not.  Vietnam has suffered for many years with wars and poverty,  families being destroyed, and sadness beyond comprehension by most of us.  This movie shows all of that and more....but also gives us, the viewers,  hope that life really can go on, and flowers do bloom again.",5,Life goes on...,954374400,"03 30, 2000",2000,801,"['watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'adopted', 'Vietnamese', 'daughter', 'was', 'entranced', 'watching', 'scenes', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'recognize', 'did', 'recognize', 'much', 'childhood', 'stories', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'accurate', 'only', 'weak', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'character', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'played', 'Something', 'was', ""n't"", 'developed', 'enough', 'too', 'many', 'blanks', 'spaces', 'think', 'movie', 'demonstrated', 'human', 'beings', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'want', 'not', 'Vietnam', 'suffered', 'many', 'years', 'wars', 'poverty', 'families', 'being', 'destroyed', 'sadness', 'comprehension', 'most', 'movie', 'more', '.but', 'also', 'viewers', 'hope', 'life', 'really', 'can', 'go', 'flowers', 'do', 'bloom', 'again']",N/A

It is several stories of hope, love, redemption and beauty for people leading difficult, often desperate lives. The stories wind together through the interactions of the characters involved in the different subplots. Most of all it is stories of people finding each other and recognizing inner beauty when others may not. It displays the haunting beauty of Vietnam amidst the poverty that many people there live in daily. I was given a copy of this on VHS by a Vietnamese friend years ago. I was impressed by the music (singing of Kien An and the lady lotus pickers) and poetry (written by her employer, Teacher Dao, who is dying of leprosy and old age).  The sweet tenacity of the cyclo driver, Hai courting the prostitute, Lan. The search for and tender meeting of the marine (Harvey Kietel) with his daughter Phuong, from a wartime liaison with a bar girl. The struggle for subsistence of little Woody and the little street girl. I was so taken by it that I recently bought a DVD of it. It's a definite keeper. It is in Vietnamese with subtitles except where Harvey Kietel speaks. A very positive, heart-warming movie! You may need to keep a box of tissues handy if you are the emotional type.

My only complaint--and it's not an insignificant one--is that the film was shot in widescreen, but the DVD is full screen.  It really needs a widescreen version, if for no other reason than that the cinematography of the Vietnamese landscape, which some of the reviewers have raved about, will allow you to see even more of Vietnam's beauty; plus, of course, ""widescreen"" is how the director intended for this film to be seen.UPDATE (1-14-2012):  I have a PAL widescreen (letterboxed) version of this film, which I noticed has ""chopped off"" about 20% of the top of the fullscreen version which I also have.  Consequently, I've come to conclude that the fullscreen (4:3) version actually shows more actual picture-content than the letterboxed version.  Apparently, some directors shoot their films in 35mm (fullscreen) and then crop the top and bottom for commercial widescreen theatrical distribution.  I would also note, however, that the letterboxed PAL version has better contrast, and sharpness, than my fullscreen version.
