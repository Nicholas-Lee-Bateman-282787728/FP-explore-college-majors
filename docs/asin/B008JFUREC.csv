I expect cute, funny, light entertainment and this movie delivered in a big way. Like the previous movie, there are some simple wholesome life messages as well; ""to be or not to be"" it's not, but loving family members despite their faults is pretty good too. As in the previous movie, this theme repeats for the humans and the smurfs in a nice way. I'd like to comment on the short scene about peanut allergies. I didn't see it as making fun of peanut allergies but making fun of irresponsible adults who don't pay attention to allergies!. The acting is extremely appropriate, the comedy was great.

What I do NOT like are lame jokes, thinly-masked foul language, poor acting, and no semblance of a script.To me, there is no more embarrassing job than being forced to act with small, computer generated animals. See: Alvin and the Chipmunks (somehow I managed to like that movie), The Smurfs, and Yogi Bear. Watching Neil Patrick Harris, a good comedic actor who had the ONLY funny scenes in the first movie, act like a complete idiot with these CGI creatures crawling around...well, it's just sad.And what about the thinly veiled foul language? ""I almost smurfed myself"", ""That was ducked up"", ""Are you smurfing kidding?"", ""holy smurf,"" ""we're smurfed,"" ""I really smurfed myself,"" ""son of a smurf"", ""where the smurf are we?"" ""up the smurfing creek without a paddle,"" ""smurf me!"" and ""I'll be smurfed!""You know, before you know it, your kids will be coming home saying ""I don't want my smurfing dinner, you smurfing SMURF!""

1565311,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUREC,FNDNreview,"[2, 8]","The success of Peyo's late 1950s Belgian comic book strip, adopted in English as The Smurfs, spawned a successful 1980s animated series - a television show that ran for nearly ten years and is still broadcast as reruns today.  Due to the popularity of the animated series, which many consider to be one of the greatest animated shows of all-time, several movies, music albums, video games, and other countless forms of memorabilia were created, all eventually leading to the 2011 live action feature film.  While the film, starring Neil Patrick Harris, Hank Azaria, Jayma Mays, and Sofia Vergara, was utterly discouraging and painfully awful to sit through, the film still went on to gross more than $560 million.  Naturally, Sony Pictures Animation could not ignore the hefty payday, quickly giving the green light for a sequel, and setting a release date two years later.  Well, two years have passed, and the Smurfs are back in The Smurfs 2.Raja Gosnell (The Smurfs, Home Alone 3) returns to direct the sequel, which once again stars Neil Patrick Harris as Patrick, Hank Azaria as Gargamel, and Jamya Mays as Grace.  Since the conclusion of the first film, Gargamel has been using his remaining power as a magic act - earning himself fame and fortune.  However, he still has it out for the Smurfs and concocts a plan to kidnap Smurfette (Katy Perry) on her birthday in hopes of extracting the formula from her to make his evil ""naughties,"" Vexy (Christina Ricci) and Hackus (J.B. Smoove), into Smurfs.  Naturally, this would allow Gargamel to create an army of his own Smurfs - of which he would then steal their essence and use the endless power to rule the world.  It's up to Papa Smurf (Jonathan Winters) and a handful of other Smurfs, along with the help of Patrick, Jamya, and Patrick's stepfather, Victor (Brendan Gleeson), to stop Gargamel before he is able to extract the formula.  The voices of Alan Cumming, Anton Yelchin, George Lopez, and Frank Welker also star in supporting roles.For those wondering if the sequel is just as painful to sit through as the original:  the answer is yes.  However, everyone needs to keep in mind that this film is not intended for the enjoyment of adults.  The film's target audience is kids between the ages of four and ten years old.  After ten years old, the odds of your children calling this film ""lame"" dramatically increases.  Still, the sequel does offer much more comedy than its predecessor, mainly from Hank Azaria's role as the eccentric wizard, Gargamel, and his evil cat, Azrael (voiced by Frank Welker).  Oddly enough, there's something funny about Gargamel getting hit by a bus and having a talking cat ask him if he's dead.  Regardless, their brief cracks and gags are isolated and scattered throughout the flick, adding a touch of enjoyment at timely moments, even though you'll have already lost all hope of enjoyment when they unexpectedly put a smile on your face.  Even though there are brief shades of light with the use of humor, this nearly hour and a half film will still conspicuously feel like three.Much like the first film, the sequel's cast is much too talented to be used in such a lackluster setting.  Both Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays, two intensely popular TV personalities, waste their craft on roles that relatively no one will appreciate.  The same can be said for the numerous voice actors used in the film, including Alan Cumming and Anton Yelchin.  And, for reasons beyond comprehension, the film uses several other high profile Hollywood personalities, such as Jeff Foxworthy, Mario Lopez, Jimmy Kimmel, and Shaquille O'Neal, in brief voice cameos as many of the Smurf voices.Speaking of voice roles, there's something immensely annoying about Katy Perry's role in the film.  It's not as though she does a poor job in the role as Smurfette per say, but this is just another occasion where one of the many voice actresses out there should have been cast in the role of Smurfette instead of a recording artist.  Not only do many of these ""musicians"" have to be successful at making their head-pounding drivel, but they also have to cross over into acting to steal a job that would have easily been better suited for someone with more experience...or talent.  Seriously, it's not as if a six year old is really going to care that Katy Perry is voicing one of the Smurfs.  Sadly, this is common practice for the majority of the animated features being released these days.Overall, it's hard to pick on a film that adults are not meant to enjoy.  The Smurfs are beloved childhood characters and to be honest, it's nice to see they're still popular today.  For many of us, The Smurfs were something we grew up watching, so there's something nostalgic about another generation also having the opportunity to enjoy these tiny, blue characters.  Most young children should get a kick out of this film, especially if the first film's DVD is sitting on your shelf and has gotten plenty of use.  No, this won't be an ideal trip to the movie theater for parents, and the overuse of the word ""Smurf"" will most likely annoy you, but the odds are you'll kids will appreciate that you sat through this generic family adventure.  Think of this film as being courteous enough to provide you with several opportunities to get popcorn refills.  In any event, it would appear The Smurfs are destined for another hefty payday with this sequel - and yet another sequel in the summer of 2015.On a side note, this was the final role for the late Jonathan Winters, who was the voice of Papa Smurf in both live action films, as well as Grandpa Smurf for three years of the animated series.  He was a beloved comedian that made millions laugh, and inspired the work of some of Hollywood's A-list comedians, including Robin Williams and Bill Cosby.GRADE:  C-FNDNreview.com",2,"The Smurfs are

1565317,AIO247KHD2O40,B008JFUREC,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","The Smurfs 2 is watchable once, but not the brilliant adaptation of the 80's cartoon TV show that the first movie was.  This was pretty predictable, even before Papa and the other smurfs left the village once again for the human world in pursuit of the kidnapped Smurfette, you knew exactly how this would end, including for the two new Gargamel creation characters.  I did like how we got to see Smurfette as the black haired, non blue being before she became a smurf, and for the new generation discovering the Smurfs who didn't grow up with the cartoon, learning how she came to be would be pretty cool to discover. Besides the predictability factor for me the storyline was a bit flat, Smurfette seemed a lot dumber in this one than the previous film and needed to be for the film's plot to work.  Neil Patrick Harris seemed to have a lot less screen time and Glee's Jayma Mays was hardly in it at all, apart from one trying to find Gargamel's hotel room number scene. She pretty much just looks after her kid in the hotel room away from the action (except to be randomly walking down the same Paris street with the kid at the end of the film which just so happens to be the exact place in the whole of Europe's second largest city where final events took place for a goodbye teary reunion with the smurfs). Why would you bring a young child with you on a quest to save the future of mankind? The first movie had a lot more human characters and actors such as Sofia Vergara to interact with Gargamel and encounter the smurfs than this sequel, which spent a lot of its time inside a hotel room or Gargamel's laboratory. Obviously the budget wasn't as big this time round.  That was a shame as it would have been good to see Parisians' reactions to the appearance of these little blue creatures, to the extent as we did in New York. There's a cool scene involving a ferris wheel but other than that and the Eifel, we don't see much of Paris.  Also the smurfs who went to Paris played no vital role in the plot, they didn't really need to be there, it's only Papa who has some interaction with Smurfette before the end scene so Papa Smurf really could have just left them at home.  They weren't really the best personality smurfs to use either, Vanity, what did he bring to the screen?  No wonder they still used Brainy on the DVD cover, even though he never left the mushroom village.The biggest disappointment was Azrael, who for me was the standout best and funniest character surprise of the first film.  This sequel's version seemed to lack a lot of the personality and behaved more like a real cat.  In the special features that came with the Australian version of this they show the filming of Azrael and it seems to be they more concentrated on the cat looking real than it being funny.  A lot of the scenes they just used a real cat and animated a face on top of it.  The first film Azrael was moving around like a cartoon cat would, this one there was maybe one or two funny moments for the feline character, but other than that he was really just someone for Gargamel to talk to instead of out loud to himself.  Gargamel too lost a lot of screen time, replaced by his two new creations, the funniest scenes were when he wasn't actually trying to do anything with the smurfs and was just performing at the theatre as a magician, or making the public kneel before him using magic on the sidewalks.  His dream of world domination and milking the smurf essence seemed a bit pointless being he was already the biggest star on the planet and could make anyone do whatever he wanted already.The sequel is worth watching once, but unlike the first film isn't really worth watching again, thereby owning.",3,"Watchable, But Nowhere Near as Good as the Original Movie, Human Actor Budget Cut Seemed To Have Occured",1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,3707,"['Smurfs', '2', 'watchable', 'once', 'not', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', '80', 'cartoon', 'TV', 'show', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'even', 'Papa', 'other', 'smurfs', 'left', 'village', 'once', 'again', 'human', 'world', 'pursuit', 'kidnapped', 'Smurfette', 'knew', 'exactly', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'including', 'two', 'new', 'Gargamel', 'creation', 'characters', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'got', 'see', 'Smurfette', 'black', 'haired', 'non', 'blue', 'being', 'became', 'smurf', 'new', 'generation', 'discovering', 'Smurfs', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'cartoon', 'learning', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'cool', 'discover', 'predictability', 'factor', 'storyline', 'was', 'bit', 'flat', 'Smurfette', 'seemed', 'lot', 'dumber', 'one', 'previous', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'film', 'plot', 'work', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'seemed', 'have', 'lot', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'Glee', 'Jayma', 'Mays', 'was', 'hardly', 'apart', 'one', 'trying', 'find', 'Gargamel', 'hotel', 'room', 'number', 'scene', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'kid', 'hotel', 'room', 'away', 'action', 'be', 'randomly', 'walking', 'down', 'same', 'Paris', 'street', 'kid', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'exact', 'place', 'whole', 'Europe', 'second', 'largest', 'city', 'where', 'final', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'goodbye', 'teary', 'reunion', 'smurfs', 'Why', 'would', 'bring', 'young', 'child', 'quest', 'save', 'future', 'mankind', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'human', 'characters', 'actors', 'such', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'interact', 'Gargamel', 'encounter', 'smurfs', 'sequel', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'hotel', 'room', 'Gargamel', 'laboratory', 'Obviously', 'budget', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', 'time', 'round', 'was', 'shame', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'see', 'Parisians', 'reactions', 'appearance', 'little', 'blue', 'creatures', 'extent', 'did', 'New', 'York', 'cool', 'scene', 'involving', 'ferris', 'wheel', 'other', 'Eifel', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'Paris', 'Also', 'smurfs', 'who', 'went', 'Paris', 'played', 'vital', 'role', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'be', 'there', 'only', 'Papa', 'who', 'interaction', 'Smurfette', 'end', 'scene', 'Papa', 'Smurf', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'left', 'home', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'best', 'personality', 'smurfs', 'use', 'either', 'Vanity', 'what', 'did', 'bring', 'screen', 'wonder', 'still', 'used', 'Brainy', 'DVD', 'cover', 'even', 'never', 'left', 'mushroom', 'village.The', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Azrael', 'who', 'was', 'standout', 'best', 'funniest', 'character', 'surprise', 'first', 'film', 'sequel', 'version', 'seemed', 'lack', 'lot', 'personality', 'behaved', 'more', 'real', 'cat', 'special', 'features', 'came', 'Australian', 'version', 'show', 'filming', 'Azrael', 'be', 'more', 'concentrated', 'cat', 'looking', 'real', 'being', 'funny', 'lot', 'scenes', 'just', 'used', 'real', 'cat', 'animated', 'face', 'top', 'first', 'film', 'Azrael', 'was', 'moving', 'around', 'cartoon', 'cat', 'would', 'one', 'was', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'funny', 'moments', 'feline', 'character', 'other', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'someone', 'Gargamel', 'talk', 'instead', 'out', 'loud', 'Gargamel', 'too', 'lost', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'replaced', 'two', 'new', 'creations', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'were', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'trying', 'do', 'anything', 'smurfs', 'was', 'just', 'performing', 'theatre', 'magician', 'making', 'public', 'kneel', 'using', 'magic', 'sidewalks', 'dream', 'world', 'domination', 'milking', 'smurf', 'essence', 'seemed', 'bit', 'pointless', 'being', 'was', 'already', 'biggest', 'star', 'planet', 'could', 'make', 'anyone', 'do', 'wanted', 'already.The', 'sequel', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'first', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'thereby', 'owning']",N/A

Join the exciting adventures of our stalwart crew as they join forces to rescue Smurfette, who knows a secret....The opening credits feature pop-up pages in a child's book.

He wants her to tell him how Papa Smurf made her blue, so he can make the pale Smurfs he made, blue. Then he can use their essence for even more powerful magic.Papa, Vanity, Grumpy and Clumsy come to the rescue and recruit Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) to help, for no good reason. Unfortunate to Patrick, his step-dad Victor (Brendan Gleason) wants to tag along. Victor means well but always messes up. While Smurfette starts thinking of Gargamel and his 2 creations as family, thinking the Smurf's don't want her since she thinks the Smurfs forgot her Birthday.Just like the first, the movie is mildly amusing. But despite Neil Patrick Harris and Brendan Gleason having good scenes together their characters weren't necessary.  The movie taking place in Paris was pretty pointless too.

And the movies revived the characters with the live action aspect.However, while the cast (including voice actors) is mostly good, the story and writing are just average. Although our kids enjoyed it, the movie was not as funny as I expected (or hoped).The unique Smurf characters have their moments, although I think more could have been done with them (aside from Grumpy Smurf's temporary positive attitude). The villainy is too cartoonish, as if the writers were trying too hard to make it that way. I would not have been surprised if an &#34;Acme&#34; brand anvil showed up. I get it, it's a mix of cartoon with live action, you can't be too &#34;real&#34; but it was way over the top cartoon action.And the story was pretty lame. The story of Smurfette (which had always puzzled me during the heyday of the cartoons) and how she became a Smurf didn't even keep my interest.

That's because the movie SMURFS 2 has just come out on DVD. In the long run kids will love it and adults will find it slightly amusing. What could make a better Christmas gift?I'll admit that I didn't see the first Smurfs movie but after watching this one I don't think it matters. We all know a little about them from years of Smurf cartoons and the like. This time around it is nearly Smurfette's birthday. The only female Smurf we know of, the rest of the Smurfs are busy planning a surprise birthday party for her. Unfortunately this leads her to believe everyone has forgotten about her.Smurfette reflects on how she came to be, how the evil sorcerer Gargamel created her as an evil alternative to the Smurfs. But when she got to spend time with the Smurfs she changed for the better. Now she's afraid of becoming what she once was all over again.About the same time this is going on, Gargamel is now in our world and playing to sell out crowds around the world as the most amazing magician known to man. The secret of his magical abilities lies in the fact that he is using Smurf essence to power his magic wand. But the amount of essence he has is dwindling so he creates new Smurfs, evil ones called Naughties named Vexy and Hackus. The problem is that they don't provide the pure essence that a real Smurf does so Gargamel sets out to recapture Smurfette and use her to alter his newest creations. If he can capture them all that works too and gives him the ability to rule the world.A portal is made and Smurfette is brought back to our world in Paris where she spends time with Vexy and Hackus. They become friends and the duo tries to show her just how much fun being bad can be. Gargamel pretends to like her and cater to her needs in the hope that she'll lure the other Smurfs here.Back in their own world the Smurfs realize Smurfette has been kidnapped and set out to rescue her. The problem is there are only enough special crystals for 4 of them to go. Led by Papa Smurf they head out to the home of Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris), the same human that helped them in the first film. When the explain what is going on Patrick, the Smurfs and his family, including the step father that Patrick has issues with (Brendan Gleason) all head for France.Confusion reigns supreme from that moment forward as with most movies made these days for the under 10 crowd. The movie does take on some serious topics though as Smurfette must deal with being good or bad. At the same time her new friends learn what it's like to be around someone who is nice. And Patrick and his step father learn that all is not what it seems when it comes to memories of what happened in their past together.The movie offers some good CGI animation (like most kids movies these days) and the comic moments involving the Smurfs is sure to bring out a number of laughs from the kids. The jokes may not be as amusing to adults, but they aren't so bad as to cause the continuous eye rolls that some movies do. The story lines are sure to create open ends to discussions you can have with your kids about being good or bad and about knowing what really happened in the past versus what they remember happened. Watch and you'll understand what I'm talking about.All in all if you have kids this is a movie I'm sure you'll want to add to their collection. And if you're a Smurf lover you'll find yourself in Heaven watching their antics once again. As a bonus there is a great old style animated short included in the special area of the DVD that has the Smurfs dealing with the headless horseman in what appears to be a Halloween themed episode.

1565347,A29XMCU3LHV9NB,B008JFUREC,Prince Charming,"[0, 0]","I actually saw The Smurfs 2 in theaters prior to seeing the Smurfs 1 on DVD.  As a child, I was a fan of these magical little blue creatures.  My daughter had an invitation to go to the movies to see the Smurfs 2 and when I told her what she was going to see, she said &#34;What's a Smurf?&#34;  Ever since then, all I hear about is Vexy, Smurfette, and the rest of the crew.The Smurfs 2 is primarily set in Paris which is sort of fun.  The movie starts out in Smurf village with Smurfette having a nightmare that she is naughty again (apparently she has this nightmare every year on her birthday).  She thinks the rest of the Smurfs forgot her birthday when really they are planning a big surprise party.  Meanwhile, Gargamel is a famous magician performing in Paris and has created two new Smurfs (called Naughties), Vexy and Hackus (or as my daughter called them, the &#34;beige Smurfs&#34;).  They are naughty but Vexy is always trying to please Gargamel, with little success.  They also enjoy tormenting the cat, Azrael.  Gargamel opens a portal to Smurf Village but is too big to fit through so Vexy goes instead and brings back Smurfette quickly.  Papa and the others hatch a plan to rescue Smurfette but just as they are about to use Papa's &#34;Smurfportation crystals&#34;, Clumsy trips and the wrong Smurfs go to find &#34;Master Winslow&#34; (Neil Patrick Harris) who just had a birthday party for his child, Blue.The Smurfs (Papa, Vanity, Clumsy, Grouchy (aka Positive Smurf)), Master Winslow, his stepdad Victor, wife Grace, and Blue all get to Paris where they focus on rescuing Smurfette.  There is a good message in there about accepting your family for who they are and finding the good in people.  At the same time, Smurfette escapes but Vexy (who is her sister) and Hackus (their brother) trick her into helping them.  Smurfette struggles between wanting to be a good, true blue Smurf and her naughty side.Ultimately, Gargamel is after the formula for how to turn the naughties into real Smurfs so he can extract their essence and use it to make himself the most powerful man in the world.  Smurfette is forced to give him Papa's formula in order to save the naughties as they will die without it.  The rest of the crew eventually gets there and they defeat Gargamel in the end (of course).  The Naughties turn blue and become real Smurfs (and have become good by the end of the movie) and they all go back to Smurf village.I would recommend this movie as long as you understand that it is definitely a movie for kids and just go in expecting a few laughs.  This is basically brain candy with a sweet message and some slapstick comedy.  Enjoy the nostalgia of the Smurfs updated for modern kids and know that it's just meant to be fun.

Again Gargamel is after the Smurfs for stealing their essence to power up his magic (instead of his usual purpose of making the Philosopher's Stone as in the comic books and the cartoon show), and again we have the Winslows along for the ride, this time with their son Blue and Patrick's stepfather Victor Doyle for the respective additions of charm and embarrassment. Throughout the story, Smurfette, Patrick Winslow, and the Naughties get to learn the lesson that family isn't about who brought you into this world, but who really cares for you as a person and who wants to see you grow as a person. Besides this, the movie still has its share of laughs from the previous movie, even if the number of Smurfs that appear in it is still limited to the five that are the main focus of the story, with the others (such as the former leads Brainy and Gutsy) having minor or even cameo roles.Unfortunately for the movie series, which is now being cancelled in favor of an all-CGI reboot by Sony Pictures, the time-traveling Smurfs-in-the-modern-world story aspect is perhaps in my book its biggest failing, as though the production crew has to rely on that kind of story to justify the budget they were given to create a good live-action/CGI-animated movie of a lesser scope than Peter Jackson's interpretation of the J.R.R. Tolkien Hobbit/Lord Of The Rings medieval fantasy series. Once was pretty much enough, and twice was pushing it.
