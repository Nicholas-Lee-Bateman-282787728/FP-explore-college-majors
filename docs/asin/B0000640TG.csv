Buck Owens recounts the time he and George argued over top billing and what George did when Buck didn't give in and let George close the show. Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, and Elvis Costello {!?} also appear. Obviously, Waylon and Cash's stories are about the &quot;bad days&quot;. Tom T. Hall, one of the many prolific songwriters in Nashville to supply George with material, appears with a story about him and George in Canada and how George wanted to do something exciting and wanted Tom to go along. Tom refused and remained &quot;on tour&quot; while George ran off somewhere. Tom tells us that the next day he heard that George had ended up kicking the windows out of a hospital in Las Vegas. Conway Twitty, Loretta Lynn, Randy Travis, Ricky Skaggs, Ricky Van Shelton, June Carter Cash, and Roy Acuff also appear giving praise and admiration to George. Sprinkled through all of this is George {circa 1989} giving commentary. also heard is an off-camera announcer giving biographical information. Clips of him performing some of his songs are also shown. He tells us what he felt of his marriage to Tammy and how upset he is that they never won any awards together. Nancy is also featured on the video as is Rick Blackburn, Billy Sherrill, and George's sister and her husband. Blackburn's story is about the time George never shown up at a huge concert in New York and he says from that point foward he started to become known as &quot;No Show Jones&quot;. Sherrill talks about the long process of recording &quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today&quot; and how the first two verses were recorded nearly a year before the start of the recitation because George hated to be in the studio. It truly is a remarkable look into the life of George Jones...in all it's ups and downs. The documentary runs from his birth, child-hood, all through his career but stops somewhere in the late '80s {the video arrived in 1989}. Who would know an artist of his stature THEN would STILL be making news and hitting the charts in the next decade that followed!!
