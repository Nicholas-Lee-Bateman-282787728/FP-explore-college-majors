1141401,AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B0013D8M3U,John. N,"[0, 1]","When it comes to TV, there aren't too many shows I follow anymore. Men's been one of the chosen programs I'll make time for, but now that the Charlie Sheen era is obviously over I would just like to grab the eight or so seasons of the show that currently exist and call it a day. After immensely enjoying seasons one and two on DVD, I picked up season three even though it was a little more expensive than the previous seasons. After watching it I wish I had waited for a price drop. To put it plainly, season three of Two and Half Men is good, but some of the story arcs are insipid.The trouble beings in ""That Voodoo That I Do Do"" picks up in ""Humiliation is a Visual Medium"" through """"My Tongue is Meat"" and finally ends with ""Arguments for the Quickie"" and ""That Pistol-Packin' Hermaphrodite."" In case you don't catch the connection between those episodes, they're the ones centered on Charlie's ""no-sex"" relationship with Mia. Introduce a terrible character and just watch how terrible things get. I'm not saying there isn't any fun to be had in these episodes, but the bad starts to outweigh the good even with dimwitted Kandi entering the picture.Adding to the negatives are boorish guest appearances by Cloris Leachman (""Madame and Her Special Friend"") and Jon Lovitz (""The Unfortunate Little Schnauser"") that only serve to annoy and make one reflect back on and wish for the brilliant Charlie, Jake and Alan-based episodes that start off the set. If anything, season three tries a bit too hard and over complicates a simple formula that hasn't hit its expiration date yet. Generally, the problematic episodes are fine enough when seen on TV where they don't play in order and quick succession of one another but in an environment where they do their weaknesses are quickly punished.If you love Two and Half Men, then you're going to buy all the seasons regardless of what you read, but I can't lie to myself about the backwards step season three takes when trying to make its characters more complex. All I can hope for is season four fairs better in package form than this and actually comes with an episode guide.",3,Starts off strong but fades during the stretch,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,2124,"['When', 'TV', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'shows', 'follow', 'anymore', 'Men', 'been', 'one', 'chosen', 'programs', ""'ll"", 'make', 'time', 'now', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'era', 'obviously', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'grab', 'eight', 'so', 'seasons', 'show', 'currently', 'exist', 'call', 'day', 'immensely', 'enjoying', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'DVD', 'picked', 'up', 'season', 'three', 'even', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'expensive', 'previous', 'seasons', 'watching', 'wish', 'had', 'waited', 'price', 'drop', 'put', 'plainly', 'season', 'three', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'good', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'insipid.The', 'trouble', 'beings', 'Voodoo', 'Do', 'Do', 'picks', 'up', 'Humiliation', 'Visual', 'Medium', 'My', 'Tongue', 'Meat', 'finally', 'Arguments', 'Quickie', 'Pistol-Packin', 'Hermaphrodite', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'catch', 'connection', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'ones', 'centered', 'Charlie', 'no-sex', 'relationship', 'Mia', 'Introduce', 'terrible', 'character', 'just', 'watch', 'how', 'terrible', 'things', 'get', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""n't"", 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'episodes', 'bad', 'starts', 'outweigh', 'good', 'even', 'dimwitted', 'Kandi', 'entering', 'picture.Adding', 'negatives', 'are', 'boorish', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Madame', 'Her', 'Special', 'Friend', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Unfortunate', 'Little', 'Schnauser', 'only', 'serve', 'annoy', 'make', 'one', 'reflect', 'back', 'wish', 'brilliant', 'Charlie', 'Jake', 'Alan-based', 'episodes', 'start', 'set', 'anything', 'season', 'three', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'complicates', 'simple', 'formula', ""n't"", 'hit', 'expiration', 'date', 'yet', 'Generally', 'problematic', 'episodes', 'are', 'fine', 'enough', 'when', 'seen', 'TV', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'order', 'quick', 'succession', 'one', 'environment', 'where', 'do', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'quickly', 'love', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'seasons', 'regardless', 'what', 'read', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lie', 'myself', 'backwards', 'step', 'season', 'three', 'when', 'trying', 'make', 'characters', 'more', 'complex', 'can', 'hope', 'season', 'four', 'fairs', 'better', 'package', 'form', 'actually', 'episode', 'guide']",Two and a Half Men:S3 (DVD)
1141402,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B0013D8M3U,Little Miss Cutey,"[47, 49]","I've reviewed the other two seasons because I love this show so much, and this season still has it.  It's managed to stay fresh and funny and still thoroughly enjoyable.  The majority of main cast members have recieved Emmy nominations and it's not hard to see why.Here is a run down of the episodes in this dvd set;WEEKEND IN BANGKOK WITH TWO OLYMPIC GYMNASTS - After Alan falls off the roof, Charlie has to look after the adolescent and increasingly obnoxious Jake for the weekend.PRINCIPAL GALLAGHER'S LEZBIAN LOVER - Alan has to lobby the principal to keep Jake from getting expelled, while Charlie is left to manage the chiropractic office for the day.CARPET BURNS AND A BITE MARK - After it's revealed Alan and Judith have been trying to reconcile, Charlie, Evelyn, and Rose vie for the role of spoiler.YOUR DISMISSIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS B**BS - Alan looks for a new place after he invites Berta to stay at Charlie's house, bringing the brothers to blows.WE CALLED IT MR PINKY - Charlie's inability to reciprocate his girlfriend's love forces him to examine his relationships with women.HI, MR HORNED ONE - Charlie's Satan-worshiping girlfriend has a knack for the supernatural, and seems to be the cause of some strange happenings around the Harper house.SLEEP TIGHT, PUDDIN POP - Charlie gets drunk and sleeps with Rose on her birthday. Rose says she knows it's no big deal. But her father quickly shows up at Charlie's house, under the impression that they've been dating for two years.THAT VOODOO THAT I DO DO - Charlie bribes Jake into taking ballet lessons so he can vie for the affections of the teacher. Things go awry, however, when Charlie and Jake find themselves competing for those affections.MADAME AND HER SPECIAL FRIEND - Charlie's elderly neighbor has an uncomfortable business proposition for Alan.SANTA'S VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED - Alan's girlfriend Sandy is Malibu's answer to Martha Stewart, causing Alan and Charlie to pack on the pounds. Their desire for her fabulous culinary output is ultimately overwhelmed her craziness.THAT SPECIAL TUG - After a disastrous evening out with his brother, Charlie decides it is time to see a shrink.HUMILIATION IS A VISUAL MEDIUM - Charlie has to decide whether he can really commit to a serious relationship with Mia, especially when sex is currently off the agenda. Unsurprisingly, his suggestion that he sleep with other women in the meantime falls on somewhat stony ground.LOVE ISN'T BLIND, IT'S RETARDED - As Charlie tries to receive his version of benefits from the relationship he has with Mia, Allen starts dating Charlie's most recent ex-girlfriend.MY TONGUE IS MEAT - Forced to hide in his garage to enjoy a brace of beers and half a Cuban cigar, Charlie's attempts to keep his unhealthy lifestyle habits secret from Mia fall apart when she smells bacon on his breath, resulting in their first major argument since taking their relationship to a physical plane.ERGO, THE BOOTY CALL - As Jake's twelfth birthday approaches, Alan is still smiling ear-to-ear over his sex life with 22 year-old hottie Kandi, even when he's forced to explain to his son what a ""booty call"" is. Meanwhile, Jake celebrates with a sip of coffee and a handful of vitamins - or at least, that's what he assumes the blue pills in his dad's bathroom cabinet are, with the ""V"" imprinted. Like Berta says, he's going to need another party hat.THE UNFORTUNATE LITTLE SCHNAUZER - At Alan's insistence and to avoid having to escort the daughter of one of ma's clients (she invited that), Charlie attends with Alan, ma and Jake the jingle awards ceremony, where he's nominated and just knows Archie Baldwin will win for the seventh year in a row, because that pompous ass always gets the sexy products, a good tune for medication like Charlie's clients is never good enough to get a fair chance. He's right, and was forced by Rose -who will otherwise stalk him again- to make her adoring teenage boyfriend Gordon give her some private space again; when that works, she changes her mind...THE SPIT-COVERED COBBLER - Alan finally has an attractive date, 22 year-old Kandi, but she's even dumber then Jake, and as Charlie rightly points out girls that age are extremely high maintenance. Charlie has his fun seeing Alan struggle with the growing pile of bills, driving him to raid Jake's mammoth piggy bank and taking a second job as pizza deliverer, but still helps his double-plucked brother when wicked ex Judith insists on alimony. Alas Kandi...GOLLY MOSES, SHE'S A MUFFIN - The Harpers's world is inverted: Charlie's ex Kandi, of his countless girls about the dumbest, not only became Alan's lover but even says she prefers sex with him, and has been living in Charlie's beach-house, as unnoticed as several furniture changes, for three weeks since she was evicted. Charlie has suffered a sexual drought even longer, by now even Berta and her cousin in prison begin to look somehow attractive. Judith finds out, and is shocked Jake is exposed to such a floozy; despite his brother's warning to keep love and business apart, Alan tries her as secretary in his surgery, with even more and worse results then either could fear...ALWAYS A BRIDESMAIN NEVER A BURRO - Alan is made to admit to Charlie, who keeps hitting it in, he has hit rock-bottom now his brainless girlfriend Kandi has moved in with his ex. It's all so confusing that Jake would prefer dad's ladies to be lesbians, then tells him Kandi's ma Mandi has joined Charlie's endless list of sexual conquests. Alan can't talk to Kandi, she just repeats Judith's phrases, clearly without understanding the words, but he sees her dad, Mandi's ex Andy, arrive on blind date with his own ex Judith. Frolicking finale at Judith's, in rooms, bed and hot-tub...AND THE PLOT MOISTENS - Alan turns to Jake's teacher for stimulating conversation, since Kandi obviously can't provide any. But the teacher starts to get the wrong idea about Alan's intentions.JUST ONCE WITH AUNT SOPHIE - Jake has his first boys-girls party, dating a smart girl, Wendy Cho. Alan was looking forward to coaching his son, but even Jake, who spends his schooldays watching the clock tick, isn't dumb enough to consider dating advice from the worst womanizer in L.A., while Charlie proves he can coach a virtually hopeless case -Alan and Judith's genes without the IQ- trough appearance, dance and anything else. In fact Alan envies Jake so much, he still hopes for ...ARGUMENTS FOR THE QUICKIE - Mia comes back and asks Charlie to donate his sperm. He agrees to, but for some unknown reason he can't deliver.THAT PISTOL-PACKIN' HERMAPHRODITE - Charlie and Mia discover that setting up a wedding with their two crazy families is a disaster, so they decide to get married in Las Vegas.If you are a fan of this show, you'll still love this season.  They still continue to deliver hilarious lines and great acting.  Jake is brilliant and one of my favourite characters, but it's still Charlie who steals every scene for me.  He's so funny and delivers his performances with impecable comic timing.  I love this programme and you'll love it too (I hope).",5,Still got it :-),1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,7111,"[""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'love', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'season',
