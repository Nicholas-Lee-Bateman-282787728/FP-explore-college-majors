I have been waiting with great anticipation ever since I heard Lena Olin was coming back.  I must admit it was nice to have Irina back, but Season 4 is no Season 2.  Season 4 was a mixed bag, with some clever twists in place - but all too often riding the same mediocre wave that carried Season 3.  I've been following the series on DVD ever since Season 1 hooked me.  Its likely what's kept me coming back.In addition to the return of Irina(which was far too short-lived), we also got ""The Clone"" which was acutally on par with some of the former seasons' ""didn't see that coming"" moments.  The plot line of the final two episodes was a bit of a letdown, contributing to that whole Season 3 vibe.  All in all, I will buy Season 5, if for no other reason to give JJ and crew a chance to redeem themselves and possibly return us to the glory of the early days.

The show combines the fast pace action sequences of 24 with the conspiracy theory backdrop of the X-Files. It also doesn't hurt that the show centers itself around a character that's a beautiful and mysterious woman. But the true strength of Alias, as with most successful TV shows, is its unique and creative writers who manage to always keep their audience on edge...Jennifer Garner (star of 13 Going On Thirty) plays the role of Sydney Anne Bristow, a beautiful, intelligent American woman recruited to work for the government's super secret SD-6 agency. However, problems arise when her fianc&eacute; is murdered by the agency she works for, and she ultimately discovers that SD-6 is not a legitimate government organization at all... In seek of revenge, Sydney contacts the CIA, and they deploy her as a double agent. Meanwhile, Sydney's estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber), also works as a double agent, and their relationship blossoms as a result of their work. Together, they manage to eliminate SD-6, and now both work full-time for the CIA where they're accompanied by fellow colleagues Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan)...The Alias (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Authorized Personnel Only"" in which Sydney quits the CIA in favor of joining a secret organization known as Authorized Personnel Only. Meanwhile, the answers Sydney uncovered in Wittenberg threaten to ruin her relationship with Jack, at least until she is forced to join forces with her father in an effort to track down a dangerous samurai... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""D&eacute;tente"" in which Sydney and Nadia go undercover together in order to dig up the location of a deadly chemical, and ""Nightingale"" in which Sydney and Vaughn risk their lives to find out the truth about Vaughn's father...Below is a list of episodes included on the Alias (Season 4) DVD:Episode 67 (Authorized Personnel Only: Part 1)Episode 68 (Authorized Personnel Only: Part 2)Episode 69 (The Awful Truth)Episode 70 (Ice)Episode 71 (Welcome to Liberty Village)Episode 72 (Nocturne)Episode 73 (Detente)Episode 74 (Echoes)Episode 75 (A Man of His Word)Episode 76 (The Index)Episode 77 (The Road Home)Episode 78 (The Orphan)Episode 79 (Tuesday)Episode 80 (Nightingale)Episode 81 (Pandora)Episode 82 (Another Mister Sloane)Episode 83 (A Clean Conscience)Episode 84 (Mirage)Episode 85 (In Dreams...)Episode 86 (The Descent)Episode 87 (Search and Rescue)Episode 88 (Before the Flood)The DVD Report",5,Fast-paced and addictive...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,2685,"['Premiering', 'September', '2001', 'Alias', 'built', 'steady', 'loyal', 'following', 'television', 'viewers', 'show', 'fast', 'pace', 'action', 'sequences', '24', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'backdrop', 'X-Files', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'show', 'character', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'true', 'strength', 'Alias', 'most', 'successful', 'TV', 'shows', 'unique', 'creative', 'writers', 'who', 'manage', 'always', 'keep', 'audience', 'edge', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'star', '13', 'Going', 'Thirty', 'role', 'Sydney', 'Anne', 'Bristow', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'American', 'woman', 'recruited', 'work', 'government', 'super', 'secret', 'SD-6', 'agency', 'However', 'problems', 'arise', 'when', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'murdered', 'agency', 'ultimately', 'SD-6', 'not', 'legitimate', 'government', 'organization', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Sydney', 'CIA', 'deploy', 'double', 'agent', 'Meanwhile', 'Sydney', 'estranged', 'father', 'Jack', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'also', 'double', 'agent', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'result', 'work', 'Together', 'manage', 'eliminate', 'SD-6', 'now', 'work', 'full-time', 'CIA', 'where', ""'re"", 'accompanied', 'fellow', 'colleagues', 'Marshall', 'Flinkman', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'Marcus', 'Dixon', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'Alias', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Authorized', 'Personnel', 'Only', 'Sydney', 'CIA', 'favor', 'joining', 'secret', 'organization', 'known', 'Authorized', 'Personnel', 'Only', 'Meanwhile', 'answers', 'Sydney', 'uncovered', 'Wittenberg', 'threaten', 'ruin', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'least', 'forced', 'join', 'forces', 'father', 'effort', 'track', 'down', 'dangerous', 'samurai', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'include', 'D', 'eacute', 'tente', 'Sydney', 'Nadia', 'go', 'undercover', 'together', 'order', 'dig', 'up', 'location', 'deadly', 'chemical', 'Nightingale', 'Sydney', 'Vaughn', 'risk', 'lives', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'Vaughn', 'father', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Alias', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Episode', '67', 'Authorized', 'Personnel', 'Only', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '68', 'Authorized', 'Personnel', 'Only', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '69', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'Episode', '70', 'Ice', 'Episode', '71', 'Welcome', 'Liberty', 'Village', 'Episode', '72', 'Nocturne', 'Episode', '73', 'Detente', 'Episode', '74', 'Echoes', 'Episode', '75', 'Man', 'Word', 'Episode', '76', 'Index', 'Episode', '77', 'Road', 'Home', 'Episode', '78', 'Orphan', 'Episode', '79', 'Tuesday', 'Episode', '80', 'Nightingale', 'Episode', '81', 'Pandora', 'Episode', '82', 'Mister', 'Sloane', 'Episode', '83', 'Clean', 'Conscience', 'Episode', '84', 'Mirage', 'Episode', '85', 'Dreams', '86', 'Descent', 'Episode', '87', 'Search', 'Rescue', 'Episode', '88', 'Flood', 'DVD', 'Report']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

923101,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000A6T2BW,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 2]","I sit here to write this review having seen 21 of the 22 episodes this season so as to avoid the possibility of spoilers. J.J. Abrams Alias is still a good show and a fun watch but the fourth season has lost some of the luster of the previous three. Maybe Abrams is spending too much time on his new series Lost to care what happens here maybe the network demanded too many changes in format. Hopefully some of these issues will be resolved in thhe final season.When I started watching this show I was amazed by both the acting and the writing. It was rare to have a network show with story arcs that kept you hanging on from week to week. I was also intrigued with the idea of Milo Rambaldi. The Fourt Season took both of these interests away. In this season the network demanded simplier stories that the casual viewer could watch and forget about. The result was a sort of bad guy of the week that was more X Files than Alias. I'm not really complaining some of the stand alone episodes were excellent just not the same. When the true story of the season got going it was just a little too late to be developed properly.the acting in the series has always been excellent and this season was no exception. Fine performances were turned in by Jennifer Garner, Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin and some of the guests were quite good. Sonia Braga and Isabella Rossellini as the Derevko sisters and the return, albeit short, of Lena Olin helped save the show at a time it was desperately needed.The six disc set by Touchstone is well designed despite the fact that the discs overlap. The picture and sound quality are excellent and the extra features are numerous. Speaking of these extras it would be nice if the commentary tracks could be spread over the entire season instead of being focused on the first episodes only.The end result is a good season but bot great. But hey its television and a guilty pleasure all the same.

The season has no focus of any kind; there is very little emphasis on the Rambaldi plotline, and what emphasis there is turns out to be ill-formed, uninvolving, and unmemorable.  The very notion of the fourth season -- that Sydney and Jack are back working for Sloane again -- is not only implausible, it makes the series up until this point weaker.The season is not a total waste.  There are some good episodes, and even a couple of great ones.  However, the entire cast is misused throughout most of the season, and every time you think something cool has happened that is going to kick things into high gear, the next episode backs off and refuses to develop into anything siginificant.It's still a better show than many, but the sad fact remains for me: ""Alias"" is a has-been.

The characters have been through heck in the first three seasons, much of it caused by a man named Arvin Sloane, and afterwards by a group called The Covenant.  In a stroke of genius, now the best of both SD-6 and the CIA are combined into APO, and headed up by (guess who?) Arvin Sloane, the guy everybody loves to hate.The usual cast of Jennifer Garner, Michael Vartan, Victor Garber, Ron Rifkin, and etc. are accompanied by the absolutely adorable Mia Maestro, who plays Sydney's half-sister Nadia Santos.  Throw in some nice guest stars like Angela Bassett, some Derevko sisters (yes, plural) and a person or two who you probably thought was dead, and you've got a great season, culminating in the ultimate family team-up to take down a terrible Rambaldi device that could trigger the next apocalypse!  And of course...The Chosen One must battle The Passenger.  And only one...will survive.  Unless you want either one to be in the next season, in which case, they might live.  But I'm not sayin' if they both survive or not, 'cause that'd be a spoiler.And the big shocker at the very end of the season, wow.  Let's just say not everyone is who they claim to be.  Now I don't know what happens in Season 5, except that somebody gets a clip or two unloaded in 'em and there's probably a double or a clone or two somewhere in there.  (I saw a few moments of the series finale...not knowing how great a show it was at the time.)  Whatever the case, while I admit there was a creepy episode or two in there, Season 4 comes on strong and has a well-deserved place amongst the other three seasons, all of which I enjoyed.

923105,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B000A6T2BW,Charity Bishop,"[0, 2]","Withdrawing from the format of previous years and concentrating more on individual plots than cliffhangers, Alias' fourth season is one of the strongest the show has to offer. It's full of the twists and turns that producer and writer J.J. Abrams loves to throw our way, but is also concentrates on more streamlined plots and focuses less on Rambaldi. It may be my favorite season.When an extraction goes wrong abroad and results in the death of a fellow agent, Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is forced to hand in her resignation to the CIA. Or so most of her fellow agents believe. In reality, she has been hand chosen from the best the agency has to offer to become part of a black ops group known as APO. With more liberty than government-sanctioned branches of the agency, APO has a much wider scope ... from halting terrorists in their tracks to rescuing operatives from the field. Excited to be part of this great opportunity, Sydney is devastated to learn that the entire operation is under the command of Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin). Formerly the head of one of the largest underground terrorist groups in the world, Sloane has bought his way back into the CIA's favor by turning over a priceless artifact.Sloane's second in command is Sydney's estranged father Jack (Victor Garber), whom she blames for the recent murder of her mother. While attempting to repair that broken relationship and find out the truth behind the assassination, Sydney is kidnapped by a dangerous foreign agent, forcing Sloane to recruit his daughter and her half sister, Nadia (Ma Maestro) to assist in her rescue. The sisters form a close bond as other familiar faces are recruited into their organization, from Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), and Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), to the lovable, brainy Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman). Sydney must put aside personal feelings and work with Sloane to ""save the world.""Then comes the complications, everything from British spies in custody to old rivalries, accumulating in a search through the dark past as Vaughn attempts to discern what really happened to his father, Sloane tries to turn over a new leaf, and Sydney learns the true meaning of family. I must admit that the first couple of episodes seem a little disjointed, as they attempt to introduce us to the entirely new format of the series, but after that the speed picks up and the audience enjoys watching the twists and turns unfold. There are plenty of undercover operations, dangerous situations, hand-to-hand fights, clever remarks, and different disguises to keep us enraptured. But more intriguing are the different relationships between characters. Nadia's budding romance with Eric Weiss (Greg Grunberg), and Sydney's never-ending struggle over whether or not to trust her father.Content issues are also surprisingly limited this season. It is implied that Sydney and Vaughn have an active sexual relationship; in the first episode, they are seen making out in bed, and later in the series while undercover as husband and wife, they take a shower together. On one other occasion, he's seen sleeping in her room. Sydney often dons provocative outfits to provide distractions. The first five minutes of season four have her in a white teddy, flirting with a suspect before she knocks him unconscious. On two other occasions she lures men into traps by intimating she's interested in sleeping with them. There's some mild sexual dialogue. Language is almost nonexistent this year, and most of the violence consists of the norm.Lots of people are shot at and/or killed, with gruesome results. People are punched, kicked, thrown through walls and into furniture, beat with furniture and other household appliances, or anything within reach. There are massive explosions and shootouts. Nadia has a flashback to the orphanage in which she attempted to save one of her friends from being kidnapped; the memory has her as a child beating mercilessly beaten about the head; then as a teenager, being similarly abused by a corrupt policeman. There are occasional moments of gore, such as a stomach-turning scene in which a man is destroyed by nuclear radiation, and the skin literally melts off his body. Sloane goes temporarily insane and beats a man to death with a pipe. Information is also extracted from informants through beatings and bullets. On a couple of occasions, the hero must kill someone in order to maintain their cover (and experiences a certain amount of guilt).For most adults, season four is a tension-filled glimpse into the underworld of intelligence. I hope and pray that our agents aren't forced to do these kinds of things, but at the same time am grateful at times that they do, in order to keep us safe. The characters of Alias are far from perfect and often suffer the devastating consequences of their actions, but are human enough that we grow to understand and like them, no matter what they do. The only real danger here is accepting that the end justifies the means, and it is sometimes appropriate to make bad decisions and do evil things in order to save the day. It's never right to commit murder, and it's hard to approve of someone being beaten for information, no matter who they are.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,5216,"['Withdrawing',

923107,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000A6T2BW,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","The third season of Alias was quite entertaining but there was a certain unremarkable thing about it. Not that it was a bad season but season 2 was so knee-deep in awesomeness that the third would most likely look kind of less than thrilling. Season 4 is certainly its most unbelievable and a bit silly at times but it was fun nonetheless.Each season has had a reboot of sorts from the takedown of SD-6 in season 2, the 2 year later thing from season 3 and now Sydney Bristow is now working for APO: Authorized Personnel Only, working with her dad, boyfriend and many friends. Only it's headed by Arvin Sloane, the evil guy that she's been so determined to take down. Plus there's more additions: Nadia Santos, introduced last season as Sydney's half-sister and another APO agent.Having Nadia on missions with Sydney has a weird dynamic duo feeling to it all which is extremely cool to have. 2 hot spies fighting to save the world and looking cute doing it never gets old. It's also quite funny in a lot of parts and it's certainly helpful for character moments. Many will roll their eyes at seeing someone like Sloane the head of an off-the-books group and it does make you question why someone wouldn't just shoot the guy as soon as they saw him.One thing that doesn't help with season 4 was ABC's insistence that the episodes wouldn't be as story-arc intensive as previous seasons, fearing viewers would lose interest if they ever missed a night. So the episodes are just that, very episodic in nature with problem in the show and solved by episode's end. There is another addition to the untrustworthy Derevko family and it's certainly a great addition especially since Katya barely shows up and Irina makes what could be considered a big guest starring role rather than a big season player.That being said there is some great episodes on here including a trip into Sloane's mind who may not be as bad as he seems, a look into Jack's mind using some time messing withs and a look into Nadia's backstory. The whole thing about another Arvin Sloane is quite funny(and oddly eerie when you watch him) but it does create a ""oh come on, yeah right!"" type of reaction.It's pretty easy to say this season is better than season 3 but like I said season 3 was enjoyable, it just wasn't as focused as it should be. Season 4 got it backwards too as there was kind of a focus but the intrigue seemed missing and with a show like Alias that's a big misstep but I mean this season does have Mia Maestro so what's not to love?",4,Quite fun if a somewhat underwhelming season,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,2515,"['third', 'season', 'Alias', 'was', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'was', 'certain', 'unremarkable', 'thing', 'Not', 'was', 'bad', 'season', 'season', '2', 'was', 'so', 'knee-deep', 'awesomeness', 'third', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'look', 'kind', 'less', 'thrilling', 'Season', '4', 'certainly', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'bit', 'silly', 'times', 'was', 'fun', 'nonetheless.Each', 'season', 'had', 'reboot', 'sorts', 'takedown', 'SD-6', 'season', '2', '2', 'year', 'later', 'thing', 'season', '3', 'now', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'now', 'working', 'APO', 'Authorized', 'Personnel', 'Only', 'working', 'dad', 'boyfriend', 'many', 'friends', 'Only', 'headed', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'evil', 'guy', 'been', 'so', 'determined', 'take', 'down', 'more', 'additions', 'Nadia', 'Santos', 'introduced', 'last', 'season', 'Sydney', 'half-sister', 'APO', 'agent.Having', 'Nadia', 'missions', 'Sydney', 'weird', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'feeling', 'extremely', 'cool', 'have', '2', 'hot', 'spies', 'fighting', 'save', 'world', 'looking', 'cute', 'doing', 'never', 'old', 'also', 'quite', 'funny', 'lot', 'parts', 'certainly', 'helpful', 'character', 'moments', 'Many', 'will', 'roll', 'eyes', 'seeing', 'someone', 'Sloane', 'head', 'off-the-books', 'group', 'make', 'question', 'why', 'someone', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'shoot', 'guy', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'him.One', 'thing', ""n't"", 'help', 'season', '4', 'was', 'ABC', 'insistence', 'episodes', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'story-arc', 'intensive', 'previous', 'seasons', 'fearing', 'viewers', 'would', 'lose', 'interest', 'ever', 'missed', 'night', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'very', 'episodic', 'nature', 'problem', 'show', 'solved', 'episode', 'end', 'addition', 'untrustworthy', 'Derevko', 'family', 'certainly', 'great', 'addition', 'especially', 'Katya', 'barely', 'up', 'Irina', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'big', 'guest', 'starring', 'role', 'rather', 'big', 'season', 'being', 'said', 'great', 'episodes', 'here', 'including', 'trip', 'Sloane', 'mind', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'look', 'Jack', 'mind', 'using', 'time', 'messing', 'withs', 'look', 'Nadia', 'backstory', 'whole', 'thing', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'quite', 'funny', 'oddly', 'eerie', 'when', 'watch', 'create', 'oh', 'come', 'yeah', 'right', 'type', 'reaction.It', 'pretty', 'easy', 'say', 'season', 'better', 'season', '3', 'said', 'season', '3', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'focused', 'should', 'be', 'Season', '4', 'got', 'too', 'was', 'kind', 'focus', 'intrigue', 'seemed', 'missing', 'show', 'Alias', 'big', 'misstep', 'mean', 'season', 'have', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'what', 'not', 'love']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

923112,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B000A6T2BW,Danno,"[23, 25]","I'm an admittedly big fan of ""Alias,"" so you'll probably have to take some of my comments with a grain of salt. Season Four, for the most part, is likeable and fun, suffering only in comparison to the heights the series reached in its first two years. Even though ""Alias"" creator J.J. Abrams seems to have run out of ideas regarding the series, he's established the characters and situations well-enough so that series can continue on sheer momentum for a while.This season, like every other season, focuses on the adventures of a small group of CIA agents who work together. Despite the opening credits' insistence on the importance of series star Jennifer Garner, this season is more a team effort than ever before. There's Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), who's a multilinguist and a master of disguise. There's her love interest Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), a decent straight-arrow of an agent troubled by his recent past. There's her father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber), who is alternately grim and emotionally unavailable, and her step-sister Nadia (Mia Maestro). They're led by the enigmatic Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), a former CIA agent who turned into both a terrorist and a criminal mastermind similar to a James Bond villain and now claims to have been reformed. Sydney has a long history with Sloane, as does the rest of her team. As if to prove that you don't have to be part of Sydney's inner circle to work for the CIA, the remainder of the team (all in subordinate roles) include a geeky comic relief computer genius named Marshall, a strong experienced backup agent named Dixon, and a formerly occassional guest character promoted to series regular named Weiss, who serves mainly as comedy relief as well as Nadia's love interest. The cast is uniformly strong; as Nadia, Mia Maestro does the best she can with a character that isn't all that well-developed.Abrams constructed the first third of the season to consist of self-contained episodes with a minimum of character development and next to no continuity. I'm assuming that this was intended to make it easier for new viewers to become interested in the series. These episodes reminded me a lot of the 1960s ""Mission Impossible"" series so perhaps it isn't surprising to learn that Abrams is working on the latest MI movie. I enjoyed these episodes a lot although I was disheartened by both the lack of continuity and absence of an overall story arc.All this changes with the remainder of Season Four, in which Abrams not only returns to the extended story arc of earlier seasons, but also revives the Tomb Raider-meets-DaVinci Code obsession Arvin Sloane has for the Renaissance megalomaniac named Milo Rambaldi. We are treated to a series of implausible but hugely entertaining vignettes involving radiation poisoning, a woman from the past manipulating Nadia's feelings, an Arvin Sloane imposter nicknamed ""Arvin Clone,"" and a Rambaldi doomsday scenario that would not seem out of place in a George Romero movie.Why can't I rank this DVD set higher? It's tough to follow the ending of the season if you aren't already a fan, for starters. If you are a fan, you're likely to be annoyed at the seemingly endless succession of stand alone episodes at the beginning of the season. You'll also be disappointed in the revisionist treatment Abrams thrusts upon the occassional ""guest villains"" from earlier seasons, as well as the almost total lack of big-name guest stars in comparison to earlier seasons. You'll wonder why Abrams does next to nothing to further the Sydney-Vaughn relationship, and marvel at the almost total lack of chemistry between Nadia and Weiss.Season Four of ""Alias"" has all the high-tech espionage, stunning stunt coordination, excellent music, and top-notch cinematography as previous seasons.

923113,A3HT7THRDLPUHH,B000A6T2BW,"D. Brunner ""tv on dvd fan""","[7, 7]","After the disappointment of season 3 to many fans, Alias goes back to basics. Alias basically started over. A new night of the week helped Alias grab its best ratings ever for season 4, and unlike the first 3 seasons most of these episodes play as stand alones, and with the complexity of most of the storylines, that may have helped new viewers jump into the action without needing to hear the back story.Being a hardcore Alias fan, I didn't like the idea of stand alones at first. Part of the reason I love the show is the season long storyline that twists and turns after every episode. Having said that, the first two episodes of season 4 blew me away, with one exeption. The cliffhanger of season 3 isn't even resolved until the beginning of episode 2. That bothered me a lot at first but the more and more I watched this season the more I think it worked out brilliantly. The new plan to make stand alone eps they resolved it in such a way that didn't require you to have seen the cliffhanger of season 3.There is a season long storyline that starts off slow, really slow, but toward the halfway mark of season 4 it picks up pace at a good speed and it well worth it by the end. The last few eps of season 4 are near perfection, but so are several mid way through.The episodes in the middle are stand alones as I said but have a continuing storyline thats easy to catch on to but not the main point of the story. Two of the best of the season are episodes 6 and 7, ""Nocturne"" and ""Detente"".The packaging is beautiful. Out of the 5 seasons of this show this set is the best to look at. It doesn't hurt that everyone in this season looks their best. A very nice set with tons of extras as well.So if anyone has yet to see a full season and is just interested in watching a few (after seeing it you'll want to watch them all!) this is the one to grab since it's easy to follow and will get you hooked immediately.",4,Alias stands alone,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,1916,"['disappointment', 'season', '3', 'many', 'fans', 'Alias', 'back', 'basics', 'Alias', 'basically', 'started', 'over', 'new', 'night', 'week', 'helped', 'Alias', 'grab', 'best', 'ratings', 'ever', 'season', '4', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'most', 'episodes', 'play', 'stand', 'alones', 'complexity', 'most', 'storylines', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'new', 'viewers', 'jump', 'action', 'needing', 'hear', 'back', 'story.Being', 'hardcore', 'Alias', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'idea', 'stand', 'alones', 'first', 'Part', 'reason', 'love', 'show', 'season', 'long', 'storyline', 'twists', 'turns', 'episode', 'Having', 'said', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', '4', 'blew', 'away', 'one', 'exeption', 'cliffhanger', 'season', '3', ""n't"", 'even', 'resolved', 'beginning', 'episode', '2', 'bothered', 'lot', 'first', 'more', 'more', 'watched', 'season', 'more', 'think', 'worked', 'out', 'brilliantly', 'new', 'plan', 'make', 'stand', 'alone', 'eps', 'resolved', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'have', 'seen', 'cliffhanger', 'season', '3.There', 'season', 'long', 'storyline', 'off', 'slow', 'really', 'slow', 'halfway', 'mark', 'season', '4', 'up', 'pace', 'good', 'speed', 'well', 'end', 'last', 'few', 'eps', 'season', '4', 'are', 'near', 'perfection', 'so', 'are', 'several', 'mid', 'way', 'through.The', 'episodes', 'middle', 'are', 'stand', 'alones', 'said', 'have', 'continuing', 'storyline', 'thats', 'easy', 'catch', 'not', 'main', 'point', 'story', 'Two', 'best', 'season', 'are', '6', '7', 'Nocturne', 'Detente', '.The', 'packaging', 'beautiful', '5', 'seasons', 'show', 'set', 'best', 'look', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'everyone', 'season', 'best', 'very', 'nice', 'set', 'tons', 'extras', 'well.So', 'anyone', 'yet', 'see', 'full', 'season', 'just', 'interested', 'watching', 'few', 'seeing', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'grab', 'easy', 'follow', 'will', 'get', 'hooked', 'immediately']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

923118,A2O8K7L29RLY54,B000A6T2BW,"E. Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[16, 18]","An amazing thing happened in the last minutes of Season 4's penultimate episode ""Search and Rescue"": I had a feeling flood over me that I hadn't felt watching Alias since it was revealed Lauren was evil at the end of season 3's ""Full Disclosure"": I was hooked.  It had been so long since Alias was the vital, nail-biting show of high excitement and high melodrama that I almost didn't recognize it anymore.  Now, here was Lena Olin exibiting the full capacity of her greatness - equal parts loving mother and twisty snake, Jack was at the edge of his wits, Sydney was frantic and focused, and Nadia, thankfully, wasn't that important except to earn welcome gooeyness out of Olin.  How exactly did this happen?Season 3 was widely viewed as a disappointment at the time, but at the beginning of season 4, it seems fans like me were nostalgic for its chaos and ambition.  To say the format for the season stretched the limits of credibility does a disservice to the limits of credibility.  A top secret CIA agency under the control of Arvin Sloane despite his so recently having been sentenced to death for treason?!  One with the lamest acronym in the history of acronyms (that being APO: Authorized Personnel Only)?  No amount of Rimbaldi-artifact-transferring makes that swallowable.  And the theoretical reconfiguation of the show, while noble, only made matters worse - a covert-op-of-the-week sameness took over in an ostensible attempt to make this look like season 1 again.  But as this opened the door for plotlines that ranged from ridiculous (a Russian Stepford Village of secret uber-spies) to embarrassing (umm, vampires?), any number of us long time fans were about to give up.  There was brief reprieve in ""Detente,"" a masterpiece exploiting Sydney's seething distrust of Sloane, climaxing in a cunning monologue about Sloane by an undercover Sydney to an insignficant baddy on a boat - it's one of the finest hours of Jennifer Garner's acting career.  Still, it seemed like an aberration - the plots never got past their high predictability.  And Nadia, as played by the gorgeous Mia Maestro, I'm afraid, is too much of a cold fish - her woe-is-me mommy issues are grating, and her unconvincing flirtation with Weiss - tv's most sexless and sparkless romance - seems there just to create a Weiss-Vaughn buddy repartee that's uninteresting to a fault.Then came ""Tuesday"" - Sydney's buried a live, APO's locked down, and for some contrived reason Marshall's the only one who can save the day.  In the process, he resurrects the show.  From there, everything works - a cunning Derevko nemesis arrives and the world actually feels in danger again!  Joel Grey as a second Sloane!  Jack's near-fatal attempt to save Sydney!  Vaughn as a rogue agent (a far more convincing meltdown than his yeah-right freak out over Lauren in season 3)!  And no amount of words can convey the greatness of seeing Olin as Irina again.  Combine that with the show's cliffhanging car crash - a fall out of your seat moment to match Sydney's Hong Kong wakeup at the end of season 2 - and we find Alias in full addictive mode again, even accepting that it may never again reach to its unmissable stride of the second season.",4,The road to recovery,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,3209,"['amazing', 'thing', 'happened', 'last', 'minutes', 'Season', '4', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'Search', 'Rescue', 'had', 'feeling', 'flood', 'had', ""n't"", 'felt', 'watching', 'Alias', 'was', 'revealed', 'Lauren', 'was', 'evil', 'end', 'season', '3', 'Full', 'Disclosure', 'was', 'hooked', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'Alias', 'was', 'vital', 'nail-biting', 'show', 'high', 'excitement', 'high', 'melodrama', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'anymore', 'Now', 'here', 'was', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'exibiting', 'full', 'capacity', 'greatness', 'equal', 'parts', 'loving', 'mother', 'twisty', 'snake', 'Jack', 'was', 'edge', 'wits', 'Sydney', 'was', 'frantic', 'focused', 'Nadia', 'thankfully', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'earn', 'welcome', 'gooeyness', 'Olin', 'How', 'exactly', 'did', 'happen', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'widely', 'viewed', 'disappointment', 'time', 'beginning', 'season', '4', 'fans', 'were', 'nostalgic', 'chaos', 'ambition', 'say', 'format', 'season', 'stretched', 'limits', 'credibility', 'disservice', 'limits', 'credibility', 'top', 'secret', 'CIA', 'agency', 'control', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'so', 'recently', 'having', 'been', 'sentenced', 'death', 'treason', 'One', 'lamest', 'acronym', 'history', 'acronyms', 'being', 'APO', 'Authorized', 'Personnel', 'Only', 'amount', 'Rimbaldi-artifact-transferring', 'swallowable', 'theoretical', 'reconfiguation', 'show', 'noble', 'only', 'made', 'matters', 'worse', 'covert-op-of-the-week', 'sameness', 'took', 'over', 'ostensible', 'attempt', 'make', 'look', 'season', '1', 'again', 'opened', 'door', 'plotlines', 'ranged', 'ridiculous', 'Russian', 'Stepford', 'Village', 'secret', 'uber-spies', 'embarrassing', 'umm', 'vampires', 'number', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'were', 'give', 'up', 'was', 'brief', 'reprieve', 'Detente', 'masterpiece', 'exploiting', 'Sydney', 'seething', 'distrust', 'Sloane', 'climaxing', 'cunning', 'monologue', 'Sloane', 'undercover', 'Sydney', 'insignficant', 'baddy', 'boat', 'one', 'finest', 'hours', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'acting', 'career', 'Still', 'seemed', 'aberration', 'plots', 'never', 'got', 'high', 'predictability', 'Nadia', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Mia', 'Maestro', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'too', 'much', 'cold', 'fish', 'woe-is-me', 'mommy', 'issues', 'are', 'grating', 'unconvincing', 'flirtation', 'Weiss', 'tv', 'most', 'sexless', 'sparkless', 'romance', 'there', 'just', 'create', 'Weiss-Vaughn', 'buddy', 'repartee', 'uninteresting', 'fault.Then', 'came', 'Tuesday', 'Sydney', 'buried', 'live', 'APO', 'locked', 'down', 'contrived', 'reason', 'Marshall', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'day', 'process', 'show', 'there', 'everything', 'cunning', 'Derevko', 'nemesis', 'arrives', 'world', 'actually', 'feels', 'danger', 'again', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'second', 'Sloane', 'Jack', 'near-fatal', 'attempt', 'save', 'Sydney', 'Vaughn', 'rogue', 'agent', 'far', 'more', 'convincing', 'meltdown', 'yeah-right', 'freak', 'Lauren', 'season', '3', 'amount', 'words', 'can', 'convey', 'greatness', 'seeing', 'Olin', 'Irina', 'again', 'Combine', 'show', 'cliffhanging', 'car', 'crash', 'fall', 'seat', 'moment', 'match', 'Sydney', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'wakeup', 'end', 'season', '2', 'find', 'Alias', 'full', 'addictive', 'mode', 'again', 'even', 'accepting', 'may', 'never', 'again', 'reach', 'unmissable', 'stride', 'second', 'season']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

923123,A1W9QAR7P545IC,B000A6T2BW,iMike,"[1, 1]","The fourth season of Alias ranks among my favorites, second only to the second season.  The action is fast-paced and it never feels like there's a dull moment.  I love the addition of Mia Maestro to the cast (we met her character very late in the third season) as Sydney Bristow's half sister Nadia Santos.  Nadia is the daughter of Syd's mother, Irina Derevko, and her arch nemesis, Arvin Sloane.The relationship between Sydney and her father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) is tested once again when Syd learns that her father murdered her mother in cold blood after learning Irina had put a contract out on Syd's life.  They actually filmed the scene, which is shown as a flashback.  I absolutely love the chemistry between Victor Garber and Lena Olin.  This does produce a slight continuity question, however.  When the flashback is shown, toward the end of season four, it says ""eighteen months earlier"" at the bottom of the screen.  Eighteen months prior to the end of season four would place this event as sometime during the middle of the third season.  Since Lena Olin did not appear in the third season, one has to conclude that Jack carried this out off-screen, which is certainly fine, but it would have to have occurred right after Jack and Irina stopped communicating via IRC instant messaging, which was actually towards the end of season three in an episode called ""Blood Ties.""  So if the murder of Irina Derevko occurred eighteen moths prior to the end of season four, that means some significant time had to pass between seasons three and four.Anyway, I digress ... it turns out Irina Derevko is alive!  Alias pulls this off beautifully ... think back to season two and the Francie/Alison fiasco.  Season four also sees Greg Grunberg and his character Eric Weiss (Vaughn's best friend)get a lot more screen time as Weiss and Nadia become an item.  The always awesome David Anders returns Julian Sark.  Fan favorite Gina Torres (Syd's former K-Directorate nemesis, Anna Espinosa) returns as well.  Season four reintroduces Katya Derevko, played to perfection by Isabella Rossellini, who was featured in three episodes in the third season) and the third (and deadliest) Derevko of them all ... Elena, played by the wonderful Sonia Braga.  This is the only season to feature all three Derevko sisters.Some other highlights from this season include ""the Arvin Clone,"" Sloane (Ron Rifkin) being placed in charge by the CIA legitimately, Vaughn (Michael Vartan) learning more about why his father was killed and what he was really involved in, Sloane's attempts to be a father (which make Jack look like the poster child for fatherhood).  We also see much more of Marshall's' life as a father and a husband; he even pulls an interesting deception over on Jack.One final thing to mention ... as much as I enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Garner and Michael Vartan, it is the chemistry between Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin that truly made this series amazing.",5,Another stellar season!,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,2971,"['fourth', 'season', 'Alias', 'ranks', 'favorites', 'second', 'only', 'second', 'season', 'action', 'fast-paced', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'love', 'addition', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'cast', 'met', 'character', 'very', 'late', 'third', 'season', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'half', 'sister', 'Nadia', 'Santos', 'Nadia', 'daughter', 'Syd', 'mother', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Arvin', 'Sloane.The', 'relationship', 'Sydney', 'father', 'Jack', 'Bristow', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'tested', 'once', 'again', 'when', 'Syd', 'father', 'murdered', 'mother', 'cold', 'blood', 'learning', 'Irina', 'had', 'put', 'contract', 'out', 'Syd', 'life', 'actually', 'filmed', 'scene', 'shown', 'flashback', 'absolutely', 'love', 'chemistry', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'produce', 'slight', 'continuity', 'question', 'however', 'When', 'flashback', 'shown', 'end', 'season', 'four', 'eighteen', 'months', 'earlier', 'bottom', 'screen', 'Eighteen', 'months', 'prior', 'end', 'season', 'four', 'would', 'place', 'event', 'sometime', 'middle', 'third', 'season', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'third', 'season', 'one', 'conclude', 'Jack', 'carried', 'off-screen', 'certainly', 'fine', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'occurred', 'right', 'Jack', 'Irina', 'stopped', 'communicating', 'IRC', 'instant', 'messaging', 'was', 'actually', 'end', 'season', 'three', 'episode', 'called', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'So', 'murder', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'occurred', 'eighteen', 'moths', 'prior', 'end', 'season', 'four', 'significant', 'time', 'had', 'pass', 'seasons', 'three', 'four.Anyway', 'digress', 'out', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'alive', 'Alias', 'off', 'beautifully', 'think', 'back', 'season', 'two', 'Francie/Alison', 'fiasco', 'Season', 'four', 'also', 'Greg', 'Grunberg', 'character', 'Eric', 'Weiss', 'Vaughn', 'best', 'friend', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Weiss', 'Nadia', 'become', 'item', 'always', 'awesome', 'David', 'Anders', 'Julian', 'Sark', 'Fan', 'favorite', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'Syd', 'former', 'K-Directorate', 'nemesis', 'Anna', 'Espinosa', 'as', 'well', 'Season', 'four', 'reintroduces', 'Katya', 'Derevko', 'played', 'perfection', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'who', 'was', 'featured', 'three', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'third', 'deadliest', 'Derevko', 'Elena', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Sonia', 'Braga', 'only', 'season', 'feature', 'three', 'Derevko', 'sisters.Some', 'other', 'highlights', 'season', 'include', 'Arvin', 'Clone', 'Sloane', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'being', 'placed', 'charge', 'CIA', 'legitimately', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'learning', 'more', 'why', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'involved', 'Sloane', 'attempts', 'be', 'father', 'make', 'Jack', 'look', 'poster', 'child', 'fatherhood', 'also', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'Marshall', 'life', 'father', 'husband', 'even', 'interesting', 'deception', 'Jack.One', 'final', 'thing', 'mention', 'as', 'much', 'enjoy', 'chemistry', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'chemistry', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'truly', 'made', 'series', 'amazing']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

For the new viewer the season starts with some generic episodes showing how things are done - Alias style.  Sydney (the main character) has had a lot to deal with over the past few years of her life.  But things are finally getting settled - that is, until she finds out a haunting secret about her father.  She finds documents at the end of the previous season that prove that her father, Jack, murdered her mother.  The mystery grows as Sydney uncovers why this happened.  In the beginning of the season Syd deals with her hatred for her father while trying to regrow the relationship.  Also, she quits her job for the CIA to go and work for a secret black-ops division.  She is shocked to discover that she will have to work for Arvin Sloane, a bad guy turned good who murdered her fiance and her best friend.  Syd and her old gang go through the season fighting the bad guys and saving the world.  Don't get me wrong, Alias isn't just some blowout show with costumes and explosions.  It also has relationships between characters that are not only understandable, but realistic.  The most prominent relationship Syd has this season is probably the relationship she is building with her new found sister Nadia. Another relationship is the relationship she is rebuilding with her partner Vaughn. They have always had strong feelings for each other but their relationship was strained over the past year. As the season progresses they gradually go back into the Alias flow and give us some serious stroy and drama.  Twists pop out when you least expect them.  Nothing is ever what it seems.  Alias is a perfect mix of lies, drama, action, romance, and relationship building.  Season Four is the perfect season to start with.  And the cliffhanger will blow your mind.

Sydney found out that her father Jack killed her mother. So that's why she was so upset about what she found at the end of season 3. She also fakes quiting her job at the CIA, just to join a secret CIA group. With everyone she knows of course just happening to be on the team. After the death of his spy wife Lauren Reed, Vaughn and Sydney figure out where to take their relationship. Which of course leads them straight to the bedroom.Sydney's sister Nadia is a regular cast member now so of course she needs a love interest too. Soon sparks start to fly between Nadia and fellow agent  Weis. Although that seems to never really lead anywhere. Vaughn soon starts to get lead on that his father is still alive and gets sent on secret missions if he wants to know where to find him. He finds information that points to Sloane as the man using him. Things get strange though when they find someone else posing as Sloane. Which is the better parts of this season.Then we get a poor excuse to why Sydney's mom is really alive. We get a flashback showing Jack clearly shoot her in the head and her fall in water. Then Jack says, maybe she had a double make believe it was her...um ok whatever Jack. When they find her she punches him, so it must've been her he shot but how the hell is she alive ?? Then the season ends with Vaughn telling Sydney he's a spy and his name isn't Michael Vaughn. Um...yeah that really makes sense. He was looking for Michael Vaughn's father all season and was obsessed with finding him. But he's not Michael Vaughn ?? The show can try too hard to leave us cliffhanger endings. Season 1's ending was good and so was season 2's and 3 left you guessing as well. Season 4's ending though almost made me lose interest in the show.Otherwise this season did have some fun episodes. I like when Sydney and Vaughn go under cover as a married couple. Where they compete with spys posing as normal american couples. The best part is where they have a shoot-out at a car dealer spot and compete with another couple. Angela Bassett joining the show is a high spot as well. Since she can act and they needed a new face. The show doesn't do much with her though. Hopefully she'll get more to do in season 5. Jack gets exposed to a deadly gas to save Sydney's life. The show  gets weird when Sydney has to pose as her own mother to get secret information from Jack in-order to save his life. At least he doesn't try to have sex with her lol. Then the season finale has Sydney, her mom, sister and father teaming up to fight....zombies ?? As they set out to save the world. There's too many zombie movies these days without them being on Alias too now.  It was still entertaining and gripping but no way the shows best stuff. Which can be said about this season. Entertaining and gripping but not the best. This one was critically acclaimed too, when it's the most confused season.

923134,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B000A6T2BW,J. SHARP,"[8, 11]","I'll say what I said for the Season 3 set: I love 'Alias' and have religiously watched every episode from day one. I have actively tried to sell my friends on it for years. And when they finally start watching (beacuse they liked 'Lost' and it's made by the same guy) it's Season 4. Oy.Yes, Season 3 was a slight drop in quality from the first two glorious seasons. But Season 4 practically fell off a cliff, especially in the first half.In order to retain the audience from J.J. Abrams' new baby, 'Lost,' 'Alias' was retooled to reintroduce the characters, drop the backstory, and make each episode self-contained. In other words, the arcs being followed by fans of the first three seasons were dumped to keep everyone from changing the channel when Locke and company signed off each week. For good measure, beautiful leading ladies Jennifer Garner and Mia Maestro were teamed in skimpy outfits so that promos sprinkled throughout 'Lost' and Monday Night Football would reel in Joe Sixpack. I was surprised they didn't have them kiss during sweeps.At any rate, the pandering gave way to the preposterous when the murderous Arvin Sloane was placed in charge of the black ops division of CIA, with two spies (Syd and Dixon) reporting directly to him whose fiance, best friend, and spouse he'd had killed. This led to Sydney making several ""I don't trust you, you vile snake"" speeches that she'd already made a dozen times over the years. In my opinion, this setup absolutely gutted her character and made everything she'd learned and done over the past three years pointless. If the real Sydney and Dixon were told Sloane was their new boss, they both would have whipped out their sidearms, emptied their clips in Sloane, reloaded, made sure his head was hamburger, high-fived each other as everyone else applauded, and bought drinks for the whole gang.Sidebar: The producers' infatuation with Ron Rifkin clouded their judgment and it mutilated the show. If they wanted to keep Sloane around for the series finale, all they had to do was keep him in prison then on the lam until time for the endgame. Using Sloane as the big bad for all five seasons was a creative crutch that kept the series from exploring new territory. Season 4 was supposedly an attempt to ""recapture"" the feel of Season 1. They failed by forcing Sloane into the mix.At any rate, the preposterous ceded to the ridiculous when YET ANOTHER Derevko sister (of yet another ethnicity) showed up who was - surprise - a spy. If they had pulled in one more Derevko spy sister or if Jack Bristow started discovering spy brothers, I would have officially handed in my Alias Geek Badge.The previous season's cliffhanger (which seemed to have something to do with Syd's childhood) was tossed out and turned into a cover story for Lena Olin's refusal to return to the show.And the low point? The vampires almost win this prize but I have to go with the deadly toy helicopters.The events leading up to Clifford the Big Red Ball threatening the world actually started to smack of the good old days. There were some interesting character-driven episodes that delved into the pasts of Jack, Arvin, and Nadia. And when Lena Olin finally showed up (however flimsy the logic), it became great.

Outside of introducing a new major character and getting a lot of her back story this is much more of a stand-alone, week-to-week season than the very serialized first three years that the cult-like following of the show was so drawn into. That's not meant to say it isn't still more serialized than your normal cop, medical, or procedural drama but it has more stand-alone episodes than any other season with room to spare and as a result the season-long product drops a bit. Some of these loner episodes are very good and popular, in their isolated and singular way, but the season-long experience I get from the first three years of the show where I can't start the next episode fast enough is largely missing from season four and the show wasn't quite the same without that established format and pacing. Towards the very end of the season it tries to get back into the overriding arc a bit but these story lines are far-fetched for me for a show that based itself essentially in our real world with a few big mythical elements, not in an outright vampire or zombie horror movie world.It's still certainly a season of television worth watching, particularly if you're already into the series, but at times it does seem a bit like a different show than what you see in the first three years. This, along with season five though it's very different stylistically than four, is ""good,"" television in my view whereas for me Season one was great and seasons two and three were just legendary.

It's an extremely well-done series.  Very engaging.  Each episode is gripping, well acted, with plenty of action, Bond-like gadetry, tremendous effects, etc.  Across any season, it has an overall story arc that holds together and keeps you coming back and wanting to see the episodes in order.  It's not quite as tightly dependent as, say, 24.  But the episodes work better in order than they do individually.  It's a great show to watch while you exercise -- the workout flies by.Alias has an overall plot that, if I explained it, would simply sound ridiculous (like Lost or 24 et al), but the good acting actually sells it and allows you to get caught up in the story and suspend disbelief.  At least enough to have fun with the show.But for those familiar with Alias who enjoyed Seasons 1-3, you may be disappointed with Season 4.It starts out very weak.  I almost stopped watching after half a dozen episodes.  The premise of the year seemed strained.  And the episodes were very mission-oriented, stand-alone without an overall storyline in my view.  I frankly felt that the team must have been distracted by launching Lost and just weren't giving this enough time to make it a good story anymore.  Acting and effects remain solid, but the intertwined twisting plot that we had come to expect got... lost.Things picked back up though in the 2nd half of the season, and caused it to finish reasonably well.For a long time fan, it's worth seeing, but it's just not as good as prior years have been.  The reason for the dropoff in viewership is pretty evident in my view.In a nutshell:- If you haven't seen any Alias, buy Season 1 first- If you like Alias a lot, get this, but lower your expectations from prior years -- it is still entertaining though, and the cast remains terrific.- If your time is limited, get Lost Season 1 instead.",3,Review without spoilers from a long-time fan,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,2038,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'episode', 'now', 'season', '1', 'episode', '1.Alias', '5-star', 'series', 'long-time', 'fan', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', '3-star', 'year.For', 'new', 'Alias', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'start', 'season', '1', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'series', 'Very', 'engaging', 'episode', 'gripping', 'well', 'acted', 'plenty', 'action', 'Bond-like', 'gadetry', 'tremendous', 'effects', 'etc', 'season', 'overall', 'story', 'arc', 'together', 'keeps', 'coming', 'back', 'wanting', 'see', 'episodes', 'order', 'not', 'quite', 'tightly', 'dependent', 'say', '24', 'episodes', 'work', 'better', 'order', 'do', 'individually', 'great', 'show', 'watch', 'exercise', 'workout', 'flies', 'by.Alias', 'overall', 'plot', 'explained', 'would', 'simply', 'sound', 'ridiculous', 'Lost', '24', 'et', 'al', 'good', 'acting', 'actually', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'least', 'enough', 'have', 'fun', 'show.But', 'familiar', 'Alias', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Season', '4.It', 'out', 'very', 'weak', 'almost', 'stopped', 'watching', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'premise', 'year', 'seemed', 'strained', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'mission-oriented', 'stand-alone', 'overall', 'storyline', 'view', 'frankly', 'felt', 'team', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'distracted', 'launching', 'Lost', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'giving', 'enough', 'time', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'anymore', 'Acting', 'effects', 'remain', 'solid', 'intertwined', 'twisting', 'plot', 'had', 'come', 'expect', 'got', 'lost.Things', 'picked', 'back', 'up', '2nd', 'half', 'season', 'caused', 'finish', 'reasonably', 'well.For', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'prior', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'dropoff', 'viewership', 'pretty', 'evident', 'view.In', 'nutshell', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Alias', 'buy', 'Season', '1', 'first-', 'like', 'Alias', 'lot', 'get', 'lower', 'expectations', 'prior', 'years', 'still', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'terrific.-', 'time', 'limited', 'get', 'Lost', 'Season', '1', 'instead']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

Or is someone from Sydney and Nadia's family tree behind the trouble?After season three, I was hoping the show would get back on track, and with this season it did.  The set-up feels a little too much like they were trying to recreate the first season magic, and that's just not going to happen.  But they did do a good job of telling great stories over the course of the season.Many fans didn't like the first third, which were mainly stand alone episodes with hints of a plot thread moving through them.  Personally, I found them just as engrossing as the regular episodes.  By the mid point of the season, things are beginning to gel with the storyline about Vaughn's father taking the forefront.  The last third was another can't miss thrill ride that ended with the end of the world - almost - and the best cliffhanger of the series.  Although I really wish they'd dump the Rimbaldi storyline already.  That's the one aspect of the show I've never liked.This six disc set continues the great season DVD sets this series has already been given.  All twenty-two episodes are presented in full surround and wide screen, looking better then originally aired.  Four episodes get commentaries by members of the cast and crew, which are always fun and informative.  There are the usual deleted scenes and bloopers as well as a profile of new cast member Mia Maestro, an interview with Jennifer Garner, director's diary, info on Marshall's gadgets, and other behind the scenes featurettes.While I don't think this show will ever regain the magic of its first season, this season was still well worth watching.  In many ways, it could stand alone, although watching from the first episode would certainly help understand all the relationships and nuances.  This is still one of my favorite TV shows currently on the air.",5,Back on Track,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,2486,"['Things', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'changing', 'Sydney', 'world', 'been', 'recruited', 'join', 'new', 'black', 'ops', 'unit', 'CIA', 'Called', 'APO', 'short', 'Authorized', 'Personnel', 'Only', 'Syd', 'thrilled', 'be', 'part', 'exclusive', 'team', 'new', 'boss', 'Sloan', 'not', 'only', 'been', 'pardoned', 'charge', 'new', 'unit', 'plus', 'side', 'friends', 'are', 'part', 'team', ""'ll"", 'have', 'lots', 'help', 'making', 'sure', 'Sloan', 'really', 'up', 'up', 'Also', 'joining', 'Sydney', 'half', 'sister', 'Nadia', 'missions', 'dangerous', 'seem', 'fairly', 'routine', 'hints', 'begin', 'emerge', 'greater', 'danger', 'afoot', 'Sloan', 'up', 'old', 'Rimbaldi', 'tricks', 'someone', 'Sydney', 'Nadia', 'family', 'tree', 'trouble', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'hoping', 'show', 'would', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'season', 'did', 'set-up', 'feels', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'were', 'trying', 'recreate', 'first', 'season', 'magic', 'just', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'did', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'great', 'stories', 'course', 'season.Many', 'fans', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'third', 'were', 'mainly', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'hints', 'plot', 'thread', 'moving', 'Personally', 'found', 'just', 'as', 'engrossing', 'regular', 'episodes', 'mid', 'point', 'season', 'things', 'are', 'beginning', 'gel', 'storyline', 'Vaughn', 'father', 'taking', 'forefront', 'last', 'third', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'thrill', 'ride', 'ended', 'end', 'world', 'almost', 'best', 'cliffhanger', 'series', 'really', 'wish', ""'d"", 'dump', 'Rimbaldi', 'storyline', 'already', 'one', 'aspect', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked.This', 'six', 'disc', 'set', 'great', 'season', 'DVD', 'series', 'already', 'been', 'given', 'twenty-two', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'full', 'surround', 'wide', 'screen', 'looking', 'better', 'then', 'originally', 'aired', 'Four', 'episodes', 'get', 'commentaries', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'informative', 'are', 'usual', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'as', 'well', 'profile', 'new', 'cast', 'member', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'interview', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'director', 'diary', 'info', 'Marshall', 'gadgets', 'other', 'scenes', 'featurettes.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'will', 'ever', 'regain', 'magic', 'first', 'season', 'season', 'was', 'still', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'many', 'ways', 'could', 'stand', 'alone', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'would', 'certainly', 'help', 'understand', 'relationships', 'nuances', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'currently', 'air']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

923153,A1WWOZONMZ55SZ,B000A6T2BW,"Mauricio Carvallo ""Melf""","[6, 7]","After finishing the final disc of this season, i felt a great dissapointment and sadness as i realized that the show is far from what it once was. The storyline remains the most important thing so i'll try not to reveal anything, though when reading most of the other reviews it's hard not to ruin yourself most of the surprises.So here i go:After 3 years of great TV, despite a few mistakes and wrong turns here and there, Alias entered its fourth season wanting to regain the audience lost in the last season. And the new structure of the episodes manged to attract more viewers, at one HUGE, WRONG, DESTRUCTIVE sacrifice, the storyline. You're watching the episode and listening "" this new weapon could wipe out an ecosystem....you must get it back and stop the terrorists from using it."" And then you think: wasn't this in the last episode? No, last time it was a bomb, and the time before it was a chemical weapon, and before that a new weapon, and before that a new defense technology...etc.etc...  Every episode is almost the same! (except for the final ones, but i'll get to them later). However, i'm not saying the episodes are bad, the missions are better than before, longer more realistic, Marshall no longer makes everything happen. Sydney and the gang have use oldschool tricks.Towards the middle of the season, the shows begins to show faint signs of a storyline, despite this, the level of excitement remains as low and you then continue to the ussual ""terrorist"" episodes. it is until the final episodes that the story takes hold and doesn't let go, but it is not as strong as past seasons for this very reason, it all happens in a short time and you don't understand what happens until the final episodes when everyhting is explained, including what happened to nadia and sloane at the end of the 3rd season. Besides, big plus here, you finally get to know what is the goddamn red ball from season 1 for.So, if the missions are good, and you get some explanation from past misteries, why do i say it is horrible for die hard fans? Well the answer is the lack of a continuing storyline, in past seasons, each episode flowed nicely into the next, however, like lost, the next episode may have nothing to do with the past one. This new way of presenting the storyline creates a whole different Alias, wich fans may not see as a better one, like i did.Secondly, the storyline only answers misteries from the 3rd season, not progressing much, not moving moving forward (this is most obvious when in the final episodes a series of flashbacks from different characters appear to explain the past). Therefore, i see season 4 only as closure for the past season. Finally the season finale, though interesting, was most different from the past ones. It felt more like a superhero movie where the villain is about to destroy the world with his evil creation and the good guy has to stop him before its too late. You'll see for yourselves if you buy it. Also, the twists and turns are getting old and predictable, much like 24's i could see the surprises a mile away! It's getting boring when the bad guy says he is good again blablablabl and we all know how that turns out later.So...yes i recommend it to new viewers, fans may find the final episodes to be the only interesting ones. Nevertheless, i feel i owe it to the show to continue watching the 5th season,and if you are a fan too you may feel you have to watch this season, but don't expect too much. I didn't and i felt dissapointed anyway.",4,"Great for new viewers, horrible for die-hard fans (A spoiler free review)",1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,3506,"['finishing', 'final', 'disc', 'season', 'i', 'felt', 'great', 'dissapointment', 'sadness', 'i', 'realized', 'show', 'far', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'storyline', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'so', 'i', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'reveal', 'anything', 'when', 'reading', 'most', 'other', 'hard', 'not', 'ruin', 'most', 'surprises.So', 'here', 'i', 'go', '3', 'years', 'great', 'TV', 'few', 'mistakes', 'wrong', 'turns', 'here', 'there', 'Alias', 'entered', 'fourth', 'season', 'wanting', 'regain', 'audience', 'lost', 'last', 'season', 'new', 'structure', 'episodes', 'manged', 'attract', 'more', 'viewers', 'one', 'HUGE', 'WRONG', 'DESTRUCTIVE', 'sacrifice', 'storyline', ""'re"", 'watching', 'episode', 'listening', 'new', 'weapon', 'could', 'wipe', 'out', 'ecosystem', '.you', 'must', 'get', 'back', 'stop', 'terrorists', 'using', 'then', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'last', 'episode', 'No', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'bomb', 'time', 'was', 'chemical', 'weapon', 'new', 'weapon', 'new', 'defense', 'technology', 'etc.etc', 'episode', 'almost', 'same', 'final', 'ones', 'i', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later', 'However', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'episodes', 'are', 'bad', 'missions', 'are', 'better', 'before', 'longer', 'more', 'realistic', 'Marshall', 'no', 'longer', 'everything', 'happen', 'Sydney', 'gang', 'have', 'use', 'oldschool', 'middle', 'season', 'shows', 'show', 'faint', 'signs', 'storyline', 'level', 'excitement', 'low', 'then', 'continue', 'ussual', 'terrorist', 'episodes', 'final', 'episodes', 'story', 'hold', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'past', 'seasons', 'very', 'reason', 'short', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'final', 'episodes', 'when', 'everyhting', 'explained', 'including', 'what', 'happened', 'nadia', 'sloane', 'end', '3rd', 'season', 'Besides', 'big', 'here', 'finally', 'get', 'know', 'what', 'goddamn', 'red', 'ball', 'season', '1', 'for.So', 'missions', 'are', 'good', 'get', 'explanation', 'past', 'misteries', 'why', 'do', 'i', 'say', 'horrible', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'Well', 'answer', 'lack', 'continuing', 'storyline', 'past', 'seasons', 'episode', 'flowed', 'nicely', 'next', 'however', 'lost', 'next', 'episode', 'may', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'past', 'one', 'new', 'way', 'presenting', 'storyline', 'whole', 'different', 'Alias', 'wich', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'better', 'one', 'i', 'did.Secondly', 'storyline', 'only', 'misteries', '3rd', 'season', 'not', 'progressing', 'much', 'not', 'moving', 'moving', 'forward', 'most', 'obvious', 'when', 'final', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'different', 'characters', 'appear', 'explain', 'past', 'Therefore', 'i', 'see', 'season', '4', 'only', 'closure', 'past', 'season', 'Finally', 'season', 'finale', 'interesting', 'was', 'most', 'different', 'past', 'ones', 'felt', 'more', 'superhero', 'movie', 'where', 'villain', 'destroy', 'world', 'evil', 'creation', 'good', 'guy', 'stop', 'too', 'late', ""'ll"", 'see', 'yourselves', 'buy', 'Also', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'getting', 'old', 'predictable', 'much', '24', 'i', 'could', 'see', 'surprises', 'mile', 'away', 'getting', 'boring', 'when', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'again', 'blablablabl', 'know', 'how', 'out', 'later.So', 'yes', 'i', 'recommend', 'new', 'viewers', 'fans', 'may', 'find', 'final', 'episodes', 'be', 'only', 'interesting', 'ones', 'Nevertheless', 'i', 'feel', 'i', 'owe', 'show', 'continue', 'watching', '5th', 'season', 'are', 'fan', 'too', 'may', 'feel', 'have', 'watch', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'i', 'felt', 'dissapointed', 'anyway']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season
923154,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B000A6T2BW,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[3, 4]","It took quite a while for me to actually get into the swing of watching this. This is the first season I've actually found it dragging, especially the first few episodes, and I really struggled to watch them. I couldn't watch more than one at a time, and in fact, I can't remember what was happening in those early episodes of season 4.I think the reason that Alias is finishing after season 5, is because of its director. J.J Abrams has done 2 seasons of Lost now, and the third Mission Impossible movie, there's rumours about a new Star Trek movie. Spreading himself a little thin, yes? This is honestly why I think Alias fell in the ratings in the US, and why it was decided to get rid of it before it really started failing.Again, after season 3, season 4 starts afresh, bringing the old team back together, which sets off some conflict right at the start. But what I always find strange, is that they seem to ignore what happened in the very last episode of the previous season, and not bring it up again until a couple of episodes into the new season. That really irritated me, as I was watching the series back to back (and now I have a big long gap until the final season comes to DVD.)I also found with this season, that some storylines almost seemed to be dredged up from old stories, and changed just enough to make them different, and make fans think it was a brand new storyline. Both my Dad & me noticed this, and originally, a few episodes in, my dad refused to keep watching, as it was just that slow. But thankfully he kept it up.It really picks up about halfway through, with the episode where Marshall got an episode basically all to himself, and got to show what he could do. He was the only one who could save Sydney, who had been buried alive. This led to hilarious scenes with Marshall at his absolute best, and it always makes episodes better, in my opinion, when he appears in them, as he's so funny!There's also not that many guest stars as in the previous seasons, which was kinda surprising, as many TV shows rely on guest stars these days. Isabella Rossellini makes a recurring appearance, and Lena Olin also makes a very surprise appearance - although more than once, if you count Jennifer Garner playing her extremely well, during one episode. You literally do a double take when you see her! There's also a very strange appearance by a Mr Kane Hodder, a name which some people will recognise, and some may not. He only had a very small appearance as ""Lead Thug in Shanghai"". Kelly McDonald also appears, showing off her fab Scottish accent, and looking she hasn't aged a day since her Trainspotting role. Angus Scrimm has had small roles since the start, and I finally spotted him as the Tall Man from Phantasm - but he gets killed off in episode 19. He's literally on screen for barely 3 minutes.The extras are as usual, excellent. The blooper reel got rewatched a couple of times, simply because it's so funny, and you get to see some very funny bloopers. Sometimes on films etc, the blooper reel is utter rubbish, this is the definitive, where the stars make right fools of themselves sometimes.Season 5 should be interesting, after the finale of season 4, and a VERY major character leaving, and with Jennifer Garner announcing she was pregnant, it meant a whole new storyline to tackle. That should be very interesting. Hopefully, they'll wind it all up with a happy ending. This is one DVD that will be going straight on my wishlist, as soon as Amazon lists it.",3,One more season to go,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,3499,"['took', 'quite', 'while', 'actually', 'get', 'swing', 'watching', 'first', 'season', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'found', 'dragging', 'especially', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'really', 'struggled', 'watch', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'more', 'one', 'time', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'early', 'episodes', 'season', '4.I', 'think', 'reason', 'Alias', 'finishing', 'season', '5', 'director', 'J.J', 'Abrams', 'done', '2', 'seasons', 'Lost', 'now', 'third', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'movie', 'rumours', 'new', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'Spreading', 'little', 'thin', 'yes', 'honestly', 'why', 'think', 'Alias', 'fell', 'ratings', 'US', 'why', 'was', 'decided', 'get', 'rid', 'really', 'started', 'failing.Again', 'season', '3', 'season', '4', 'starts', 'afresh', 'bringing', 'old', 'team', 'back', 'together', 'off', 'conflict', 'right', 'start', 'what', 'always', 'find', 'strange', 'seem', 'ignore', 'what', 'happened', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'previous', 'season', 'not', 'bring', 'up', 'again', 'couple', 'episodes', 'new', 'season', 'really', 'irritated', 'was', 'watching', 'series', 'back', 'back', 'now', 'have', 'big', 'long', 'gap', 'final', 'season', 'DVD', 'also', 'found', 'season', 'storylines', 'almost', 'seemed', 'be', 'dredged', 'up', 'old', 'stories', 'changed', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'different', 'make', 'fans', 'think', 'was', 'brand', 'new', 'storyline', 'Dad', 'noticed', 'originally', 'few', 'episodes', 'dad', 'refused', 'keep', 'watching', 'was', 'just', 'slow', 'thankfully', 'kept', 'up.It', 'really', 'up', 'about', 'halfway', 'episode', 'where', 'Marshall', 'got', 'episode', 'basically', 'got', 'show', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'could', 'save', 'Sydney', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'buried', 'alive', 'led', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'Marshall', 'absolute', 'best', 'always', 'episodes', 'better', 'opinion', 'when', 'so', 'funny', 'also', 'not', 'many', 'guest', 'stars', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'kinda', 'surprising', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'rely', 'guest', 'stars', 'days', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'recurring', 'appearance', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'also', 'very', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'more', 'once', 'count', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'playing', 'extremely', 'well', 'one', 'episode', 'literally', 'do', 'double', 'take', 'when', 'see', 'also', 'very', 'strange', 'appearance', 'Mr', 'Kane', 'Hodder', 'name', 'people', 'will', 'recognise', 'may', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'very', 'small', 'appearance', 'Lead', 'Thug', 'Shanghai', 'Kelly', 'McDonald', 'also', 'showing', 'off', 'fab', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'looking', ""n't"", 'aged', 'day', 'Trainspotting', 'role', 'Angus', 'Scrimm', 'had', 'small', 'roles', 'start', 'finally', 'spotted', 'Tall', 'Man', 'Phantasm', 'killed', 'off', 'episode', '19', 'literally', 'screen', 'barely', '3', 'minutes.The', 'extras', 'are', 'usual', 'excellent', 'blooper', 'reel', 'got', 'rewatched', 'couple', 'times', 'simply', 'so', 'funny', 'get', 'see', 'very', 'funny', 'bloopers', 'Sometimes', 'films', 'etc', 'blooper', 'reel', 'utter', 'rubbish', 'definitive', 'where', 'stars', 'make', 'right', 'fools', 'sometimes.Season', '5', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'finale', 'season', '4', 'VERY', 'major', 'character', 'leaving', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'announcing', 'was', 'pregnant', 'meant', 'whole', 'new', 'storyline', 'tackle', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'wind', 'up', 'happy', 'ending', 'one', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'straight', 'wishlist', 'as', 'soon', 'Amazon']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

I agree with the weak points of season 3, but it was actually good.  In a sense we say Jack's live through Michael's relationship with Lauren.  I LOVE the idea of Sydney and Michael not being together.  Like other shows when the prime characters get together the show suffers..Here my complain with S4... What of the papers that Syd read at the end of season 3.. they touched the point of her being a subject in one of Jack's projects, and then come up with him killing Irina.. I did not buy it Also I did not like the idea of the two together, but we did not see them together too much..  I love the ending of season 4 and even more the idea of Nadia in a coma.  SORRY!! for those of you that like her.. I did not..  Too much family.. and a daughter of Sloane.. a good person.. oh please!!  if they wanted a sibling.. give her Sark.. that would have been wonderful but also predictable.Touching about the possible betrayal of Michael.. look closely at S3... they touch the point of psychological conditioning, and he knew too much about Rambaldi without clear explanations, and Irina told him to come clean with Syd... You have to watch the episodes on DVD and all the answers are there.MY MAJOR COMPLAIN:  I do not like the DVD sets very much.  They lack major things, that you find in others.. PERFECT example the Buffy DVD sets they are full of goodies, chapter selection, commetaries in episodes and others.  I have all 4 ALIAS sets and they are very poor on the extra departments.. But I will gladly purchase season 5 next year and so on.I only hope we have more ALIAS, and that the introduction of the new cast of Season 5 does not mean major changes in the future.",4,The One that could,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,1958,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'ALIAS', 'season', '1', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'US', 'had', 'wait', 'March', 'year', 'get', 'full', 'dose', 'season', '22', 'episodes', 'back', 'back', '22', 'weeks', 'something', 'experienced', 'US', 'season', '3.Like', 'other', 'reviewers', 'season', '1', '2', 'were', 'excellent', 'agree', 'weak', 'points', 'season', '3', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'sense', 'say', 'Jack', 'live', 'Michael', 'relationship', 'Lauren', 'LOVE', 'idea', 'Sydney', 'Michael', 'not', 'being', 'together', 'other', 'shows', 'when', 'prime', 'characters', 'get', 'together', 'show', 'suffers..Here', 'complain', 'S4', 'What', 'papers', 'Syd', 'read', 'end', 'season', '3..', 'touched', 'point', 'being', 'subject', 'one', 'Jack', 'projects', 'then', 'come', 'up', 'killing', 'Irina..', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'Also', 'did', 'not', 'idea', 'two', 'together', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'together', 'too', 'much..', 'love', 'ending', 'season', '4', 'even', 'more', 'idea', 'Nadia', 'coma', 'SORRY', 'her..', 'did', 'not..', 'Too', 'much', 'family..', 'daughter', 'Sloane..', 'good', 'person..', 'oh', 'please', 'wanted', 'sibling..', 'give', 'Sark..', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'also', 'predictable.Touching', 'possible', 'betrayal', 'Michael..', 'look', 'closely', 'S3', 'touch', 'point', 'psychological', 'conditioning', 'knew', 'too', 'much', 'Rambaldi', 'clear', 'explanations', 'Irina', 'told', 'come', 'clean', 'Syd', 'have', 'watch', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'answers', 'are', 'there.MY', 'MAJOR', 'COMPLAIN', 'do', 'not', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', 'lack', 'major', 'things', 'find', 'others..', 'PERFECT', 'example', 'Buffy', 'DVD', 'are', 'full', 'goodies', 'chapter', 'selection', 'commetaries', 'episodes', 'others', 'have', '4', 'ALIAS', 'sets', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'extra', 'departments..', 'will', 'gladly', 'purchase', 'season', '5', 'next', 'year', 'so', 'on.I', 'only', 'hope', 'have', 'more', 'ALIAS', 'introduction', 'new', 'cast', 'Season', '5', 'not', 'mean', 'major', 'changes', 'future']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

923174,A8BY9TZTKQU3J,B000A6T2BW,The Fingers On My Keyboard,"[11, 15]","`Alias' continues to be a fun show this season. One should, however, keep in mind that fun in the form of cool gadgets, imaginative scenarios and creative stunts was always complementary, if not peripheral, to the compelling relationships, and their implications on and revelations pertaining to the plot's characters, during the first three seasons, and ask if that was the case this time.Arvin Sloane, Irina Derafko and Jack Bristow keep things interesting. They're nicely ambivalent characters whose actions, decisions and words always detract from any expectations that the show's audience is tempted to settle on at the risk of simplifying their motivations and the psychology behind their choices. Four seasons in, and even up to that concluding moment when Sydney seems to finally allow herself to hope for something good in Sloane, the idea that Sloane could have become a simple father figure just screams `diminution of character' inside my head.Lauren was a disappointment in the third season. Naturally, when new characters are introduced, the audience almost instinctively becomes suspicious of them - the result of some clever hardwiring on the part of the writers. However, all manner of intrigue about Vaughn's wife was promptly extinguished as a result of the writers and directors simply turning the tables too hard on us. Sloane becoming a dubious philanthropist was a surprising and subtly suggestive, but ultimately opaque, change of predicament for the show's signature villain, and genuinely kept you guessing at his end game (which, I might add, Season Four still reveals almost nothing about explicitly). Lauren, however, quickly became bland when she was revealed to simply be a dominatrix, seemingly harmless in desk-job office wear - a match in treachery to Julian Sark, whose enigmatic winsomeness and shady elusiveness her character couldn't emulate, rendering her all the less interesting.Nadia in Season Four suffers the same fate for a similar reason: All manner of possibility and tension about her, built up in a riveting close to the third season and an excellent opening half to this, was defused by way of some frustratingly convenient turns of plot. It would have been utterly gripping if Sydney and Nadia had, in fact, confronted each other over Jack Bristow and his supposedly murdering their mother. However, not only does Jack tell Nadia the truth in a scene of incredibly flat revelation, but, also, what do Sydney and Nadia ultimately fight over? In the words of Eleanor, `a bit of tap water'. There was no meaningful cause to that conflict (which, by the by, was lazily choreographed in my opinion - Francine's clone was, no doubt, more formidable), and all the anticipation generated from Sydney's discovery of what her mother knew became lost - just like that.What I found to be the weakest link to this season, ironically, was the leading lady herself. Whereas she was energetic and very convincing in her performance in the first three seasons, alternating competently between vehemence and vulnerability (especially when she cried - went all the way, you could tell), here the second half of the season was an exhibition of plain lazy acting on her part (yes - we find ourselves in a room with a nuclear coil, and we say, `Yeah - it's getting a little hot in here.'). She showed a great deal of promise in the first half actually - I thought she did `hapless' and `distraught' very well when she was under the influence of that suspicious substance that messes with your perception - but everything went downhill from `Nightingale' onwards. She didn't deserve that Emmy nomination this year. Trust the Academy to overlook understated talent from Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin (the latter did the hypnotisation scene wonderfully - a yearning for some manner of peace done without self-consciousness, thus making Sloane, for a moment, somehow smaller, yet sympathetically so). Really it's the old timers that keep the show from tumbling into vapidity.I had an issue with pay-offs from this season as well. There comes a time, the producers must realise, when the danger in situations conceived doesn't become convincing anymore - somehow, someway, our favourite characters always manage to get away. It takes creativity, therefore, and the writers' trademark, inspired sense of originality to consistently create a genuine sense of danger. They still managed that through Season Three, but there were a lot of letdowns in this one. They could have done so much with `Liberty Village' but settled for a deux ex machina sort of ending that saw one small device conveniently blowing up the sole (read: ONE) helicopter that came for Sydney and Vaughn. And while Sydney did `paranoid gal' very well - `It's my father - I think I killed him'? Nah - didn't buy into it one moment.But you see I have a soft spot for `Alias' (damn you J.J.). I love the camerawork in this season and the treatment of the film - brooding noir-ish tones that embrace shadows and eschew the slick psychedelia of previous seasons, giving Number Four an apposite, unnervingly languid mood for what still is a potent tale of espionage. Michael Giacchino's score seems to have found a similarly inspired turn, and this season's soundtrack attains real form as a proper (well, almost at least) body of work, instead of a patchy collection of themes.This season really pushes the envelope of otherwise inconceivable, Bond similarities - situations that would be ridiculous in another show, gadgets too sophisticated to be available so easily - but the cast, somehow, still manages to pull off the outrageous premise and make it work (or, at least, make me buy into it). In a sense it works like that other J.J. Abrams baby `Lost' - that everyone escapes with only mild cuts and scratches is unbelievable, but he quickly reminds you that that's not the point.And, of course, one might say that this whole season is worth owning for its last few moments alone. Again, I thought there'd be a bigger pay-off from stopping Eleanor's plot (we all see the rather indiscreet parallels to `Dawn of the Dead' here - giant red ball and sanguinary idiots instead of animate zombies), and it's precisely because of that that I really, really hope that the Rembaldi storyline doesn't end just like that (Sydney - the only one who could stop `true evil'? Didn't feel like that great a triumph to me). But for a while I thought this could be the cliffhanger that dwarfed all the others before - brilliantly executed (both technically and in terms of the emotional modulation), and so unnerving again because it's a revelation made so matter-of-factly and calmly, which makes its disruption all the more abrupt and rude (who's to say, really, that it was an accident?).So yes - I'm still staying for Season Five. But with you-know-who's death, Garner better do `hapless' and `distraught' well enough to carry the next season.",3,Of Unevenness and a Certain Nuclear Core,1129075200,"10 12,

The show always opens with guns barroling, and they don't stop until a heartstopping cliff-hanger.  J.J. Abrams alwasy said that he made the show as an omage to the classic serial of television of the silver age.The show is constantly changing its promise, but for the most part it centers around Sydney Bristow (the female equivalent of James Bond) and her misandventures with Michael Vaughn her cohert and lover as they try to protect their country and family.  Originally Sydney had been working for SD6 (a subossed secret department of CIA) until they killed her fiance, her astranged father finally todl her that she was working for the enemy she thought she was fighting.  For the next season and a half, Sydney was a double agent, until the real CIA overtook SD6.  Very soon after that she was in a fight that resulted in her walking up 2 years later with no memory.  The third season was about Sydney tying to recover her missing years.The fourth season finds Sydney getting back on with her life after figuring out her past.  With her newly discovered sister by her side, she goes back to doing what she does best (being a secret agent) until rumbling about her long thought dead Mother start to come around again.This season was a welcome breath of fresh air from the past season.  Originally shown over 20 consecutive weeks, Seaosn 4 provided a semi-light hearted alternative to the dark and depressing third season.

They could have done so much more though. Still it is good. I just wish it could have lasted a few more years. Excellent cast and story line. I highly recommend watching all 5 seasons, but don't expect Season 5 to resemble Seasons 1 through 3.",4,"Alias, Season 4",1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,380,"['have', 'watched', 'episode', 'Alias', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'TV', 'ruined', 'Season', '4', 'kind', 'original', '3', 'seasons', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Still', 'good', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'Excellent', 'cast', 'story', 'line', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', '5', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Season', '5', 'resemble', 'Seasons', '1', '3']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season

The writers and producers must be trippin' if they think we're gonna fall for these bull**** storylines.... they were probably on a serious trip  while writing it! nothing in the show makes sense anymore, but the show remains a fun action series even if it lacks logical storylines so I'm still going to watch it, especially after that cliffhanger. I'd like to see what they're gonna come up with now!",3,A little better than last season but still mediocre,1127952000,"09 29, 2005",2005,663,"['just', 'deleted', 'last', 'review', 'season', 'gave', 'show', '4', 'stars', 'now', ""'m"", 'giving', 'just', 'three', 'stars', 'realized', 'show', 'became', 'mediocre', 'action', 'series', 'instead', 'excellent', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'drama', 'was', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'writers', 'producers', 'must', 'be', 'trippin', 'think', ""'re"", 'gon', 'fall', 'bull****', 'storylines', 'were', 'probably', 'serious', 'trip', 'writing', 'nothing', 'show', 'sense', 'anymore', 'show', 'fun', 'action', 'series', 'even', 'logical', 'storylines', ""'m"", 'still', 'going', 'watch', 'especially', 'cliffhanger', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'gon', 'come', 'up', 'now']",Alias - The Complete Fourth Season
