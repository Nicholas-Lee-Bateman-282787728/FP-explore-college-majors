764608,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000ALPIW,A Customer,"[6, 48]","My review is in two parts - First 'The Christmas Box':Summary:Richard Evans (Richard Thomas) his wife, Keri Evans (Annette O'Toole), and their daughter, Jenna (Kelsey Mulrooney), are new to Salt Lake and are struggling to develop satisfactory lives for themselves.  Richard has just started a ski shop, The Ski Company, and is spending long hours getting it up and running.  Keri, meanwhile, is a stay at home mother, though she also manages their apartment complex.  But Keri isn't happy with their current apartment and wants something better for Jenna.When they see an advertisement for an elderly woman, Mary Parkin (Maureen O'Hara), who is looking to have a young family move in with her to help her out, Keri jumps on the opportunity and soon the Evans family has moved in with Mrs. Parkin, an extremely wealthy elderly lady who desperately needs someone to love.Quickly, the Evans family, especially Keri and Jenna, become friends with Mary, but it isn't long before Mary begins experiencing serious health problems and begins a quick descent towards her to death.  But before she can go, she is determined to help Richard not make the same mistake her husband made: losing sight of the importance of family by focusing too much on providing for them.  Mary accomplishes this with the help of angelic visitations to Richard's dreams by Mary's deceased daughter, Andrea.  Eventually, Richard does realize how important family is and ends up cutting back on his work to spend more time with his wife and daughter.  And, to everyone's surprise, Mary ends up leaving her monstrous house to the Evans family.My Comments:You'll notice that my summary didn't include mention of a Christmas Box.  That's because the Christmas Box in the movie plays such a minor role that it really isn't even worth mentioning.  As it turns out, it is just the location where Mary has stored letters to her deceased daughter and, though it plays mysteriously a few times, Richard is the only one that hears it.  So, I have no idea why this movie is called The Christmas Box when the box is not at all central to the story.  A better, serious title would have been 'Angel in the Avenues'.  Though I think I am more partial to 'Ingratiatingly Cheesy Christmas Movie' or my wife's suggested title 'The Cheeseball Mormon, Pseudo-Christmas Movie'.I also nearly fell off my exercise bike (this isn't a movie you can feel okay about watching while doing nothing else) when I heard the protagonists name - Richard Evans?  That's the book's author's name.  Wow, how original!  Oh yeah, and did you catch the name of his company - The Ski Company.  Obviously creative names were not very high up on the priority list for this story.Speaking of the story, it was incredibly predictable and not at all engaging.  I knew the Evans family would be chosen to live with Mary, otherwise why would it be part of the story?  I also knew that Mary would end up loving the family and giving them the house, or at least a ton of money - otherwise why tell the story?  There are no surprises.  But my biggest problem with the story is that it doesn't follow a traditional 3 act sequence.  By 45 minutes into the movie (1/2 of the entire movie in this case), there was no introduction of the major conflict.  It was only at about this point that Richard began having his dreams, but even they didn't result in or resolve a conflict.  As a matter of fact, there never was a clear conflict and the movie was nearly over before the movie explicitly states what it is supposed to be about - the importance of family.As far as the acting goes, I really can't believe people continue to cast Richard Thomas in, well anything.  He should be blacklisted just for being as annoying as he is.  Every time he came on screen I cringed.  He is utterly unconvincing, he overacts, and has no theatrical delivery.  I've seen better child actors; a lot of them, actually.  The only person I didn't want to see die in the movie is the only one that did - Maureen O'Hara.  She wasn't outstanding, but she wasn't nearly as bad as the rest of the cast.  Too bad she's had to die.Overall, I definitely would not recommend this movie for anyone who has good taste or who appreciates good acting as this movie appeals to neither.  It is painful to watch despite its aim at being a wholesome, uplifting movie.  I should also note that the sequel is a better, though it isn't great.",1,"Cheesy, only a little touching; horrible acting",1071360000,"12 14, 2003",2003,4414,"['review', 'two', 'parts', 'First', 'Christmas', 'Box', 'Summary', 'Richard', 'Evans', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'wife', 'Keri', 'Evans', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'daughter', 'Jenna', 'Kelsey', 'Mulrooney', 'are', 'new', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'are', 'struggling', 'develop', 'satisfactory', 'lives', 'Richard', 'just', 'started', 'ski', 'shop', 'Ski', 'Company', 'spending', 'long', 'hours', 'getting', 'up', 'running', 'Keri', 'meanwhile', 'stay', 'home', 'mother', 'also', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Keri', ""n't"", 'happy', 'current', 'apartment', 'something', 'better', 'Jenna.When', 'see', 'advertisement', 'elderly', 'woman', 'Mary', 'Parkin', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'looking', 'have', 'young', 'family', 'move', 'help', 'out', 'Keri', 'opportunity', 'soon', 'Evans', 'family', 'moved', 'Mrs.', 'Parkin', 'extremely', 'wealthy', 'elderly', 'lady', 'who', 'desperately', 'someone', 'love.Quickly', 'Evans', 'family', 'especially', 'Keri', 'Jenna', 'become', 'friends', 'Mary', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Mary', 'begins', 'experiencing', 'serious', 'health', 'problems', 'quick', 'descent', 'death', 'can', 'go', 'determined', 'help', 'Richard', 'not', 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'husband', 'made', 'losing', 'sight', 'importance', 'family', 'focusing', 'too', 'much', 'providing', 'Mary', 'accomplishes', 'help', 'angelic', 'visitations', 'Richard', 'dreams', 'Mary', 'deceased', 'daughter', 'Andrea', 'Eventually', 'Richard', 'realize', 'how', 'important', 'family', 'up', 'cutting', 'back', 'work', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'wife', 'daughter', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'Mary', 'up', 'leaving', 'monstrous', 'house', 'Evans', 'family.My', 'Comments', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'summary', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'mention', 'Christmas', 'Box', 'Christmas', 'Box', 'movie', 'minor', 'role', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'out', 'just', 'location', 'where', 'Mary', 'stored', 'letters', 'deceased', 'daughter', 'mysteriously', 'few', 'times', 'Richard', 'only', 'one', 'So', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'movie', 'called', 'Christmas', 'Box', 'when', 'box', 'not', 'central', 'story', 'better', 'serious', 'title', 'would', 'have', 'been', ""'Angel"", 'Avenues', 'think', 'am', 'more', 'partial', ""'Ingratiatingly"", 'Cheesy', 'Christmas', 'Movie', 'wife', 'suggested', 'title', 'Cheeseball', 'Mormon', 'Pseudo-Christmas', ""Movie'.I"", 'also', 'nearly', 'fell', 'off', 'exercise', 'bike', ""n't"", 'movie', 'can', 'feel', 'okay', 'watching', 'doing', 'nothing', 'else', 'when', 'heard', 'protagonists', 'name', 'Richard', 'Evans', 'book', 'author', 'name', 'Wow', 'how', 'original', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'did', 'catch', 'name', 'company', 'Ski', 'Company', 'Obviously', 'creative', 'names', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'high', 'up', 'priority', 'list', 'story.Speaking', 'story', 'was', 'incredibly', 'predictable', 'not', 'engaging', 'knew', 'Evans', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'chosen', 'live', 'Mary', 'otherwise', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'part', 'story', 'also', 'knew', 'Mary', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'family', 'giving', 'house', 'least', 'ton', 'money', 'otherwise', 'why', 'tell', 'story', 'are', 'surprises', 'biggest', 'problem', 'story', ""n't"", 'follow', 'traditional', '3', 'act', 'sequence', '45', 'minutes', 'movie', '1/2', 'entire', 'movie', 'case', 'was', 'introduction', 'major', 'conflict', 'was', 'only', 'about', 'point', 'Richard', 'began', 'having', 'dreams', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'result', 'resolve', 'conflict', 'matter', 'fact', 'never', 'was', 'clear', 'conflict', 'movie', 'was', 'nearly', 'movie', 'explicitly', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'importance', 'family.As', 'far', 'acting', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'continue', 'cast', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'well', 'anything', 'should', 'be', 'blacklisted', 'just', 'being', 'as', 'annoying', 'Every', 'time', 'came', 'screen', 'cringed', 'utterly', 'unconvincing', 'theatrical', 'delivery', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'child', 'actors', 'lot', 'actually', 'only', 'person', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'die', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'did', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'was', ""n't"", 'outstanding', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'rest', 'cast', 'Too', 'bad', 'had', 'die.Overall', 'definitely', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'taste', 'who', 'good', 'acting', 'movie', 'appeals', 'painful', 'watch', 'aim', 'being', 'wholesome', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'sequel', 'better', ""n't"", 'great']",The Christmas Box / Timepiece

764610,A23UB49EG29MVT,B0000ALPIW,Commenter77,"[2, 2]","""The Christmas Box,"" a Hallmark movie, fits in with old classic Hollywood and some more modern Christmas season favorites, this one with the theme of coming around to what's important after all.  It quickly became a favorite with its initial and subsequent airings, spawning a prequel giving background on Mary (the elderly lady's) past with her husband and child.Young couple with five year old daughter cramped in a small apartment, wife working as building manager with all those hassles, husband working night and day trying to build a business, wife trying for a breakout for them, bidding for more space and family time.  She finds an ad to do meals and light housekeeping for an elderly lady in a multi-winged estate-like mansion, coaxes hubby along for the interview.  That portion was pretty funny, with the reluctant hubby cracking on the situation, both about and during the interview, wife eager to please and the old lady a humorless tartar.  Even the hopeful little daughter was daunted.  But, they get the job and in they move.  True to previous form, dear young hubby continues to chafe under contact with ""Brunhilda,"" who is equally displeased, ticking him off in acidic tones for various ""infractions.""  However, true to her form, the wife is anxious to please and have this place work out, which earns her initial restrained approval from Mary.Richard Thomas is no longer John Boy folks.  He is a talented actor.  His interaction with Mrs. Parkins in the interview and subsequent confrontations yields appreciable reactive gratification for its effect.  The interview alone was at least a three titter segment at the conflict of humors, especially between hubby and Madam Formidable.  His comebacks are well timed, appropriate and effectively nuanced.  Yet, the indomitable dragoness, though softening, always prevails.  As she begins to actually develop relationships with the wife and daughter, you see her begin to take on hubby as a project.  His frustration is clear and understandable.  He attempts to confront her with it, being fully fed up with her quixotic style, in the instant case, manipulating a ride from him on his way to work.  He couldn't be more straight about it, asking her what is it she wants from him.  Her level response is ""a ride home; be here at 2.""  Poor guy. But pretty funny.The angel dream thing and the spontaneous playing of the music box, which only he hears, are fanciful. And, this goes along with about every old and new Christmas movie having an element of the same, sometimes explained, sometimes readable, sometimes just an improbable.  Common element with the genre.  If you don't like the genre, best to just move on.As this goes along, with Mary's health declining, Richard becomes more involved, making honest attempts to connect with Mary, beginning to realize his overall disconnect from family life.  His portrayal here, conversations with his business partner and interaction with his wife are convincing and effective.  The wife holds her own throughout, and they endure in their love, despite their conflict over priorities.  The little girl, Jenna, is a sweetheart, a natural little five year old.  He decides on the way back from the hospital one day to visit the cemetery where Mary visited every week, and discovers her daughter's grave with the angel marker, the same angel he saw in his rather disturbing recurring dream.  A last visit to the Christmas box in the attic with its letters from Mom (Mary) to her departed daughter, expressing her love and desire to be reunited with her one day, furnish the final pieces to his puzzle about the whole thing.This is a beautiful experience, with depth and effective portrayals of people deepened and enriched by their developing love and care for someone who becomes part of their lives and their becoming an inestimable comfort to her final days of life.The experience is complete to me with this film.  While ""Timepiece,"" the later produced prequel to the story, was well enough written, it was also pretty intense, not as well acted and unnecessary to me for the impact and fullness of the story.

Now both are included on DVD, letting us into the bittersweet story of the Parker and the Evans families, from the 1940s to the 1990s.In &quot;The Christmas Box,&quot; the Evans family is interviewed by elderly, wealthy widow Mrs. Parkin (Maureen O'Hara) for a live-in status, since their apartment is too small for them now. To their surprise, they are brought in on a trial basis, and mom Keri (Annette O'Toole) and daughter Jenna (Kelsey Mulrooney) rapidly grow closer to the old woman. But Richard (Richard Thomas) is often busy -- so busy that he's almost never there for his family. But Mrs. Parkin's mysterious past, a cache of old letters, and a strange question lead him back to the first gift of Christmas.&quot;Timepiece&quot; shifts back in time to the end of World War II. David Parkin (Kevin Kilner) is the owner of a successful, extremely busy company. He takes on a new secretary, Mary Anne Chandler (Naomi Watts), and begins to fall in love with her. But she has a secret: She's pregnant and unmarried. Undaunted, David marries her and they raise her daughter as their own. But when David's friend Lawrence (James Earl Jones) becomes the target of a gang's racism, something tragic will happen to the new family.The films are rather different in tone, although both will probably leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling, especially during the Christmas season. &quot;Christmas Box&quot; is a Christmas movie with a touch of mystery (who are the letters to? And what happened in Mary Anne's past?), whereas &quot;Timepiece&quot; is a straightforward family/friends story with a touch of tragedy and Christmas. They both have some major differences from the original novels, but the spirit of them is still in there.The acting is more or less spotless in both movies. Richard Thomas and Annette O'Toole are fantastic as the couple who bickers a bit, but love each other dearly; O'Hara is astounding as Mary Parkin in her old age. James Earl Jones (of &quot;Star Wars&quot; fame) and Naomi Watts (of &quot;Ring&quot; fame) are also wonderful in &quot;Timepiece.&quot; The child actors are somewhat flat at times (especially the kid who plays Andrea) but they don't detract from the stories at all.Tis the season to be mildly sentimental, which is why people watch &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot; For a couple of beautiful, lovable films with good acting and a bit of heartbreak and a dollop of romance, this is a must-have.

The Richard Paul Evans runaway best seller is given the typical TV touch with only Maureen O'Hara's glorious presence elevating the film.  While Annette O'Toole has some glowing moments as the wife, Richard Thomas doesn't have the dramatic punch to give the character its dramatic conflict.  But O'Hara is wonderful as the mysterious elderly lady who takes Thomas and his family on as housekeepers, etc.  There's never really any explanation for Thomas' angel dreams nor any resolution of O'Hara's mysterious past.  While TIMEPIECE may offer some insight, it's not fair to a viewer to leave so many loose ends.

After living in a small apartment decide to move into a stately mansion in Salt Lake City to care for an elderly woman, Mary Parkin (played by Maureen O'Hara.)Mary Parkin is older, and in declining health. As Keri takes care of her, she learns of Mary's illness. She finds Mary has not long to live. Mary and Jenna take a liking to each other.  Jenna accidently breaks a vase and writes Mary a book about how sorry she was to have broken the vase, thinking the vase is very old and it not replaceable. Mary tells her she never liked the vase in the first place.Richard is putting in long hours at a new Ski Supply business he and a friend have just opened.Richard Thomas consequently is not spending enough time with his daughter during the Christmas season.Jenna asks Richard to go find a Christmas tree with her and Richard is too busy, to find a tree with her. At this point Mary asks Richard what the first Christmas gift was. Richard cannot answer but says he will give it some thought.Mary continues to ask him every few days, what the gift was, and Richard is not able to answer.During the night all of the sudden Richard is having nightmares about a Christmas Box that is found in the attic.This box begins to haunt Richard as he tries to unfold the mystery of the box. He is unable to sleep at nigt. He keeps seeing an angel that looks like a child. He goes to the box and finds letters and reads the love letters written about the angel (child)In the process Mary Parkin who sees that Jenna needs to be with her Father more tries to make Richard understand the true meaning of Christmas.I have to stop at that point because I will give the plot away.This is an outstanding Christmas movie that will get you in the Christmas mood. This movie is very heartwarming and might even shed a tear or two. This is my favorite Christmas movie ever.Timepieces is a prequal of The Music Box and it deals with David Parkin and how they meet and she goes to work for him and how they fall in love.David gives her a timepiece, there is a tragic accident that David and Mary have to overcome.The events lead up to the Christmas Box.Both are very good movies, but in my mind the Christmas Box is much better",5,An Outstanding Christmas Movie,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,2327,"['movie', 'couple', 'Richard', 'Keri', 'Played', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'young', 'daugher', 'Jenna', 'living', 'small', 'apartment', 'decide', 'move', 'stately', 'mansion', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'care', 'elderly', 'woman', 'Mary', 'Parkin', 'played', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'Mary', 'Parkin', 'older', 'declining', 'health', 'Keri', 'care', 'her', 'Mary', 'illness', 'Mary', 'not', 'long', 'live', 'Mary', 'Jenna', 'take', 'liking', 'other', 'Jenna', 'accidently', 'vase', 'Mary', 'book', 'how', 'sorry', 'was', 'have', 'broken', 'vase', 'thinking', 'vase', 'very', 'old', 'not', 'replaceable', 'Mary', 'never', 'liked', 'vase', 'first', 'place.Richard', 'putting', 'long', 'hours', 'new', 'Ski', 'Supply', 'business', 'friend', 'have', 'just', 'opened.Richard', 'Thomas', 'consequently', 'not', 'spending', 'enough', 'time', 'daughter', 'Christmas', 'season.Jenna', 'Richard', 'go', 'find', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'Richard', 'too', 'busy', 'find', 'tree', 'point', 'Mary', 'Richard', 'what', 'first', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'was', 'Richard', 'can', 'not', 'answer', 'will', 'give', 'thought.Mary', 'ask', 'few', 'days', 'what', 'gift', 'was', 'Richard', 'not', 'able', 'answer.During', 'night', 'sudden', 'Richard', 'having', 'nightmares', 'Christmas', 'Box', 'found', 'attic.This', 'box', 'haunt', 'Richard', 'unfold', 'mystery', 'box', 'unable', 'sleep', 'nigt', 'seeing', 'angel', 'child', 'box', 'letters', 'love', 'letters', 'written', 'angel', 'child', 'process', 'Mary', 'Parkin', 'who', 'Jenna', 'be', 'Father', 'more', 'tries', 'make', 'Richard', 'understand', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas.I', 'have', 'stop', 'point', 'will', 'give', 'plot', 'away.This', 'outstanding', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'Christmas', 'mood', 'movie', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'might', 'even', 'shed', 'tear', 'two', 'favorite', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'ever.Timepieces', 'prequal', 'Music', 'Box', 'David', 'Parkin', 'how', 'meet', 'work', 'how', 'fall', 'love.David', 'timepiece', 'tragic', 'accident', 'David', 'Mary', 'have', 'overcome.The', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'Christmas', 'Box.Both', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'movies', 'mind', 'Christmas', 'Box', 'much', 'better']",The Christmas Box / Timepiece
