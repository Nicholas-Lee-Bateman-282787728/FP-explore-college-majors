1016009,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B000HT3P56,A Forest Fan,"[2, 2]","This series is great fun if you can get past the political partisanship.The Hollywood writers seem to make a jab at the Bush Administration (or just Bush and Cheney personally) every episode. Their criticisms about the 1)loss of our rights, 2) loss of our freedom, 3) lies about the war on terror, 4) evil torture of terror suspects, and 5) evil spying on every American by Bush are even more humorous consider the stories were written after Bush won re-election. So of course the writers then take to task the ""stupid"" voters for re-electing the guy. (in the ""Jibber Jabber"" episode.)Never mind that the voters also elected a fully Democrat congress in 2006 to supposedly head off this river of abuses. And never mind that the Obama administration today continues every single program that led to the death of Bin Laden, and continuing the war on terror. The Hollywood writers do their part, to try to get Democrats elected, while making up the facts as they go along. One can be assured the tone of every political episode would have been written from the opposite side, with Obama as President.Denny Crane, lovable as he is, is the typical Hollywood straw man conservative who must be knocked down with false positions and false statements misrepresenting 1/2 of the potential television audience for the show, if the writers were interested in writing for all Americans and just not their favored political party.If it seems I'm lingering on national politics on what is supposed to be entertainment, surprise! You just got a preview for 9/10ths of the episodes from this season. Good thing I got it at a discount.",3,Great Fun if you can get past the partisanship,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,1618,"['series', 'great', 'fun', 'can', 'get', 'political', 'partisanship.The', 'Hollywood', 'writers', 'seem', 'make', 'jab', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'just', 'Bush', 'Cheney', 'personally', 'episode', 'criticisms', '1', 'loss', 'rights', '2', 'loss', 'freedom', '3', 'war', 'terror', '4', 'evil', 'torture', 'terror', 'suspects', '5', 'evil', 'spying', 'American', 'Bush', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'humorous', 'consider', 'stories', 'were', 'written', 'Bush', 'won', 're-election', 'So', 'course', 'writers', 'then', 'take', 'task', 'stupid', 'voters', 're-electing', 'guy', 'Jibber', 'Jabber', 'episode', 'Never', 'mind', 'voters', 'also', 'elected', 'fully', 'Democrat', 'congress', '2006', 'supposedly', 'head', 'off', 'river', 'abuses', 'never', 'mind', 'Obama', 'administration', 'today', 'single', 'program', 'led', 'death', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'continuing', 'war', 'terror', 'Hollywood', 'writers', 'do', 'part', 'try', 'get', 'Democrats', 'elected', 'making', 'up', 'facts', 'go', 'along', 'One', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'tone', 'political', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'opposite', 'side', 'Obama', 'President.Denny', 'Crane', 'lovable', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'straw', 'man', 'conservative', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'knocked', 'down', 'false', 'positions', 'false', 'statements', 'misrepresenting', '1/2', 'potential', 'television', 'audience', 'show', 'writers', 'were', 'interested', 'writing', 'Americans', 'just', 'not', 'favored', 'political', 'party.If', ""'m"", 'lingering', 'national', 'politics', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'entertainment', 'surprise', 'just', 'got', 'preview', '9/10ths', 'episodes', 'season', 'Good', 'thing', 'got', 'discount']",Boston Legal - Season 2

The relationship between Alan Shore and Denny Crane is the backbone of this series and both James Spader and William Shatner do a fantastic job, acting wise, with these two carachters. The dialogue is superb and there are many very clever and amusing moments almost in every episode. Very amusing also the quirky judges appearing in the various courtrooms: this show does definitely not take itself very seriously, something that is in itself refreshing. And interestingly enough, by keeping it light, it draws us quite powerfully into the serious issues regardless. The only complaint I have is the dissapearing of some of the female carachters from last season. I missed the sassy Tara and the two other female actresses from last year. They added some interesting dynamics and depth to the show, making the show a bit more than just about Denny and Alan.

This second season is equally as good as the first, and I still watch it each and every week.  The witty banter and the bizzare cases and relationships are hilarious.  William Shatner and James Spader steal the show but all of the cast is really good.  They all have the perfect timing and delivery that makes for a great comedy/drama.My favourite episodes in this season are ... There's Fire (where Denny is caught in a closet with another woman on his wedding day) and the one with Tom Selleck who wants Shirley back in his life even though he's now getting married.

Some of the commentary that is utilized in the final summations in court are priceless!!!  Some comments have been made about defective discs.  I had that problem with Season 1 which Amazon corrected forthwith!  No such problems with the preordered set of Season 2 which I just watched all 7 discs - all clear with no problems whatsoever.

This is the only program I must tape due to the number of commercials and the late hour, I miss too many endings.  How wonderful to have the DVD's without interruption to view over and over again!  I have loaned them out and converted people who ""never watch TV"".  It truly difficult to find adult entertainment on TV with substance, humor, social commentary, great writing and acting (the entire cast is great but Spader is still the best), but this show has it all!

1016053,AGSWTH7SP2256,B000HT3P56,R. W. Rasband,"[11, 11]","Like ""Scrubs"" (another vastly underappreciated series), ""Boston Legal"" enters each week into a loopy alternate universe where the most insane comedy brilliantly and smartly illuminates this other world in which we mere mortals are presently stuck.  I believe this show started out as another TV legal drama, but it has exhilaratingly mutated into a wonderful mixture of the two sides of David Kelley--soap opera and berserk farce.The main reason for me to tune in is James Spader as the ""ethically challenged"" attorney Alan Shore.  Spader was stuck being typecast as yuppie scum for the first era of his career (but he was always eminently watchable).  In the recent movie ""Secretary"" he reinvented himself and his persona as The Perv With The Heart Of Gold, and this is also the basis for Shore.  He is a cold barracuda with a basilisk stare and a rampaging libido who hides his essentially kind heart.  He also has that Don Rickles tongue--he will say anything to anybody.  In season 2, which is on this DVD set, we get to see several sides of Shore: his aid to the beleagured ""Hands"" Espenson; his clown phobia (with Spader's priceless horrified facial expressions); his night terrors; and flirtation with his foxy, wholesome, crazy assistant Melissa (Marisa Coughlan).Spader's unexpected partner in crime is the Captain himself, William Shatner, as senile egomanical blowhard and wily legal genius Denny Crane (DennyCrane!). Shatner and Spader turned out to be as terrific a comedy team as Abbott and Costello (or Ackroyd and Belushi, or Spade and Farley.)  Spader's cerebral introvert plays off Shatner's wild extrovert, and vice versa.  And Shatner's larger-than-life performance gets to break through the ""4th wall"" of the TV screen, just like Bugs Bunny (""I'm actually a pretty good actor"" he tells Spader at one point; ""I won an Emmy, y'know."")This season also marked the arrival of the excruciatingly charming and pretty Julie Bowen (fresh from ""Ed""; where in the hell is that DVD?) as attorney Denise Bauer.

Today however if they are, they are watching the right shows and Boston Legal happens to be one of them. After numorous nods from the emmys this show bursts onto the small screen better than ever. With a minor cast change unfortunatly letting go of Monica Potter, the cast is just as sharp and witty. With a new full time cast member in Julie Bowen and plenty of appearences from very famous faces, including Michael J. Fox, Tom Seleck and Robert Wagner every episode expands the story of the law firm of Crane Poole & Schmidt and even does justice by wrapping up older stories from the first season.

1016061,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000HT3P56,Wayne C. Rogers,"[7, 8]","First, I have to agree with everything Amazon's Editorial Critic, Jeff Shannon, had to say in his review.  I wish I'd written it myself.  I absolutely love this show.  It's brillantly written, acted, directed, designed, and filmed.  I quickly became a fan of the Alan Shore (James Spader) character during the last season of The Practice.  I then followed him to Crane, Poole & Schmidt, where he blossomed into the type of lawyer that you have to stand up and cheer for, no matter how naughty he is at the office.  Though his long trial closings may tire him, they bring pure joy to my heart with the sense of justice embedded within each word that he utters.  Great writing!  In Season 2, Alan Shore also became more human with his fear of clowns, night terrors, and a level of stress that causes him to mix up his words.  More thought was definitely put into Denny Crane's (William Shatner) character this season, as well as his friendship with Alan and the get together on the balcony at the end of each show.  They both embody the true meaning of friendship between men, while kidding about it at the same time.  Though I didn't particularly like the characters played by Mark Valley, Candice Bergen, and Rene Auberjonois in the first season, I grew to respect them much more in Season 2 as their characters were fleshed out and given more to do.  The scenes where Paul Lewiston (Rene Auberjonois) confronts his daughter about her drug addiction was the type of acting that brings tears to one's eyes with the truth, love, and sincerity that are protrayed.  Adding to the cast of regulars was Julie Bowen as Denise, who hopes to make partner within the firm.  She brough a new edge to the series with her intelligence and sexiness, and I was surprised by what happened in the last episode.  I don't want to give away any spoilers.  Boy, was this also the year for guest stars: Tom Selleck (you could definitely see the chemistry between him and Candice Bergen), Michael J. Fox (who can still knock you out with his acting, charm, and boyish good-looks and ends up saving the day at the end), Joanna Cassidy (still as beautiful and sexy as ever), Jeri Ryan (I don't know about Alan Shore's breath, but she literally took mine away), Ed Begly, Jr., Robert Wagner, Henry Gibson, Howard Hesseman, Betty White, Freddie Prince, Jr., and even director, Wes Craven.  Parker Posey's addition to the cast at the end of the season was a stroke of genius.  Think of the movie, Blade III, but without the fangs.  She's going to be a match for Alan Shore!!!  The only complaint I have about the disc collection is that the two featurettes only total about fifteen minutes.  There should've been two-to-three hours of extras.  One clear thing that has happened with Season 2 (I don't know if it's the writers or the actors doing it), is that the characters acknowledge that this is a TV show through comments here and there.  Rather than pulling me out of the moment, it causes me to laugh along with them and to enjoy the tongue-in-cheek jest.  In my opinion, Boston Legal is the best series on television today.  As much as I dislike lawyers, I love the ones on this show and often think that I'd like to be Alan Shore with his firm sense of justice, equality, integrity, and sexual pervertedness.  When he gives you his promise, you know that he'll keep it no matter what the cost.  I'd rate this collection 10 Stars, if I could, but five will have to suffice.
