As a Professor Layton fan, I had to order this movie. I was hoping that it would be amazing, because no other video-game movies have impressed me yet. But this did not disappoint. With perfect voice-acting, incredible animation, amazing story and characters, beautiful music, and wonderful incorporation of puzzles, it is not possible that this movie could not impress you. Truly the best movie ever.",5,Fit for a True English Gentleman,1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,516,"['Absolutely', 'Incredible', 'Awe-Inspiring', 'Breathtaking', 'words', 'describe', 'how', 'truly', 'incredible', 'movie', 'Professor', 'Layton', 'fan', 'had', 'order', 'movie', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'amazing', 'other', 'video-game', 'movies', 'have', 'impressed', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'perfect', 'voice-acting', 'incredible', 'animation', 'amazing', 'story', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'music', 'wonderful', 'incorporation', 'puzzles', 'not', 'possible', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'impress', 'Truly', 'best', 'movie', 'ever']",N/A
1382455,A36NMMVWY6BP1V,B00423BITS,evani1997,"[0, 0]","For years we have gotten several bad movies based on video games (*cough* Super Mario Bros.). You would think making a movie based on a video game would be as easy as making a movie out of a book, but apparently it is not. Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva, based on the hit-selling DS games, shows that making a good video game movie is not impossible.The movie takes place between the games Professor Layton and the Last Specter and Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask. Professor Layton has received a letter from an old student of his named Janice who now performs at an opera. The letter tells about how a friend of Janice named Melina died a while ago. A while later, a little girl comes to Janice claiming that she is Melina who has been giving the gift of eternal life. The professor, along with his apprentice Luke, goes to the opera to investigate. The story is filled with surprises and is very much like the actual games. Though I would recommend playing the games first, it doesn&#8217;t seem like you need to play them in order to understand the movie.This film is made in Japan, so it features an anime style animation. That being said, the animation is incredible and takes a step further than the games&#8217; anime cutscenes.Unfortunately, though the style of anime looks great, it leads to some rather awkward dialogue. Unlike most anime films, the English dubbing is actually pretty good. However, there are a few instances where the dialogue seems rather strange, such as the professor deducing who the villain was because of a dark, gloomy castle.Perhaps the only other real problem with the movie is the fact that there was never an American dub, so everyone has their British actors. If you&#8217;ve played the games, the only voice you will be able to recognize is Professor Layton&#8217;s. This wouldn&#8217;t be a big problem if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that Luke&#8217;s British actress is incredibly annoying.The music in the movie, however, is great. With a very European style soundtrack, the music features very catchy tunes. One of the only problems with the music is that even though the song Janice sings sounds good, it was never translated from the Japanese. I&#8217;m not sure she&#8217;s performing in a Japanese opera, but by what I&#8217;m gathering, she&#8217;s not.Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva is both a great video game movie and a great anime movie. Though, I would have appreciated the inclusion of some bonus features, the story is very good, the animation is incredible, and the music is great. The creators should also get points for not making a bad video game movie. Overall, this is a great movie for Professor Layton fans.Final Score: 8/10",4,Layton Does it Again!,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,2710,"['years', 'have', 'gotten', 'several', 'bad', 'movies', 'based', 'video', 'games', '*cough*', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'would', 'think', 'making', 'movie', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'easy', 'making', 'movie', 'book', 'apparently', 'not', 'Professor', 'Layton', 'Eternal', 'Diva', 'based', 'hit-selling', 'DS', 'games', 'making', 'good', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'not', 'impossible.The', 'movie', 'place', 'games', 'Professor', 'Layton', 'Last', 'Specter', 'Professor', 'Layton', 'Miracle', 'Mask', 'Professor', 'Layton', 'received', 'letter', 'old', 'student', 'named', 'Janice', 'who', 'now', 'opera', 'letter', 'how', 'friend', 'Janice', 'named', 'Melina', 'died', 'while', 'ago', 'A', 'later', 'little', 'girl', 'Janice', 'claiming', 'Melina', 'who', 'been', 'giving', 'gift', 'eternal', 'life', 'professor', 'apprentice', 'Luke', 'opera', 'investigate', 'story', 'filled', 'surprises', 'very', 'much', 'actual', 'games', 'would', 'recommend', 'playing', 'games', 'first', '8217', 'seem', 'need', 'play', 'order', 'understand', 'movie.This', 'film', 'made', 'Japan', 'anime', 'style', 'animation', 'being', 'said', 'animation', 'incredible', 'step', 'further', 'games', '8217', 'cutscenes.Unfortunately', 'style', 'anime', 'looks', 'great', 'rather', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'most', 'anime', 'films', 'English', 'dubbing', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'strange', 'such', 'professor', 'deducing', 'who', 'villain', 'was', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'castle.Perhaps', 'only', 'other', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', 'never', 'American', 'dub', 'everyone', 'British', 'actors', '8217', 'played', 'games', 'only', 'voice', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'Professor', 'Layton', '8217', 's.', 'wouldn', '8217', 'be', 'big', 'problem', '8217', 't', 'fact', 'Luke', '8217', 'British', 'actress', 'incredibly', 'annoying.The', 'music', 'movie', 'however', 'great', 'very', 'European', 'style', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'very', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'One', 'only', 'problems', 'music', 'even', 'song', 'Janice', 'sings', 'good', 'was', 'never', 'translated', 'Japanese', '8217', 'not', 'sure', '8217', 'performing', 'Japanese', 'opera', 'what', '8217', 'gathering', '8217', 'Layton', 'Eternal', 'Diva', 'great', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'great', 'anime', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'inclusion', 'bonus', 'features', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'animation', 'incredible', 'music', 'great', 'creators', 'should', 'also', 'get', 'points', 'not', 'making', 'bad', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'Professor', 'Layton', 'fans.Final', 'Score', '8/10']",N/A
1382456,A15T8XWJ85U2X0,B00423BITS,"Marco Rossini ""Marco""","[17, 21]","Although I'm a HUGE Hayao Miyazaki fan, I don't know much about other manga or anime films. I didn't know anything about this film or this was based on a game for Nitendo DS either, but I must say I'm glad I had a chance to watch it, because it was very good!The graphics were one of the many things I was impressed with, as they used various different computer graphics which they managed to mix well with more ordinary animation. Various London scenes appear, such as Regent Street, double decker buses, London taxis and so on which made me smile. An amazing thing is that this was made in Japan, and the animators must have done a lot of research to get the views and objects right.The characters including Professor Layton were all adorable, and it will be easy for small viewers to be fond of them. The storyline and various happenings reminded me of other well-known anime films, such as 'Howl's Moving Castle', 'Laputa - Castle In The Sky' and 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind', and although nothing is wrong with showing some influences from other great films of the past, I think I got this impression slightly too many times during the film.As always, I watched it with the original Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles, and I think it's far more enjoyable than watching it with the English dub, although if there is a child amongst the viewers it's definitely better to watch it in his/her native language, as following subtitles must be tiring for them. I think the story is cleverly made, and there are happy and sad moments, a lot of thrilling scenes too, and it gives several opportunities for the viewers to think in order to solve a number of puzzles, so it will be good and fun in this sense too.Just one more point: on the back of the DVD cover it states there are 30 mins of special features, but I couldn't find them anywhere in this DVD. I wonder if I'm not looking at the right places or they don't exist in the first place? For this small reason I'd give four stars, but otherwise it'd definitely deserve five!Hope you (and your kids) will enjoy it!",4,Very Vood Graphics and Storyline!,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,2081,"[""'m"", 'HUGE', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'other', 'manga', 'anime', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'game', 'Nitendo', 'DS', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'graphics', 'were', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'was', 'impressed', 'used', 'various', 'different', 'computer', 'graphics', 'managed', 'mix', 'well', 'more', 'ordinary', 'animation', 'Various', 'London', 'scenes', 'appear', 'such', 'Regent', 'Street', 'double', 'decker', 'buses', 'London', 'taxis', 'so', 'made', 'smile', 'amazing', 'thing', 'was', 'made', 'Japan', 'animators', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'research', 'get', 'views', 'right.The', 'characters', 'including', 'Professor', 'Layton', 'were', 'adorable', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'small', 'viewers', 'be', 'fond', 'storyline', 'various', 'happenings', 'reminded', 'other', 'well-known', 'anime', 'films', 'such', ""'Howl"", 'Moving', 'Castle', ""'Laputa"", 'Castle', 'Sky', ""'Nausicaa"", 'Valley', 'Wind', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'showing', 'influences', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'past', 'think', 'got', 'impression', 'slightly', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'film.As', 'always', 'watched', 'original', 'Japanese', 'soundtrack', 'English', 'subtitles', 'think', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'English', 'dub', 'child', 'viewers', 'definitely', 'better', 'watch', 'his/her', 'native', 'language', 'following', 'subtitles', 'must', 'be', 'tiring', 'think', 'story', 'cleverly', 'made', 'are', 'happy', 'sad', 'moments', 'lot', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'too', 'several', 'opportunities', 'viewers', 'think', 'order', 'solve', 'number', 'puzzles', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'fun', 'sense', 'one', 'more', 'point', 'back', 'DVD', 'cover', 'are', '30', 'mins', 'special', 'features', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anywhere', 'DVD', 'wonder', ""'m"", 'not', 'looking', 'right', 'places', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'first', 'place', 'small', 'reason', ""'d"", 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'deserve', 'five', 'Hope', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A
1382457,A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,B00423BITS,"M.D.C. ""Tempting Reviews""","[5, 8]","I assume that the same people who wrote for the Layton games also had a hand in writing for this DVD, but there were times I did question myself.  It's entirely possible that I'm just being too picky - I had orderedProfessor Layton and the Last Specter, but Amazon botched the order somehow.  Now I am debating whether to cancel it.Anyway, let's start with the DVD itself.  There is a little bit of DRM encoded in the disc - it totally nerfed my Remote Disc capability on my Mac.  In my situation I was attempting to play it on myApple iMAC 27, which does have a DVD drive, but enjoy it on myApple MacBook Air MC965LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION), which does not, in a different room.  I received a DRM error the moment the intro logo played.  Much to my chagrin, I was forced to then rip the DVD to a local file so that I could play it.  I really wish these media houses would get a clue.  Summary: there is at least a small bit of DRM.  Won't affect the majority of users playing locally, shouldn't affect big screen DVD players at all.The first 3 or so minutes of the DVD consist of previews of all of the cutscenes from all of the Layton games, including Specter. It was nice to see them on a larger scale, and perhaps there is hope for a DVD representation (OVA) of each one of these.  It's painful watching them on the DS' tiny screen, and some of the clips are quite excellent.  I did hear where voices seemed to be drowned out in favor of backing audio tracks, and unless I put the sound to maximum, I couldn't make things out.  This is because the DVD was encoded to expect the user to use Dolby Pro Logic II to make the audio discreet, but it would have been better to encode for Stereo or Dolby Surround instead, then increase the vocal and subdue the music.  But what do I know.As the video starts, Layton is solving a puzzle in one of the London clock towers.  He receives a letter from a former student who would like for him to come see her perform at an opera.  Luke is a bit skeptical, as he didn't ever recall her ever being such a good singer.  Things take a strange turn as the opera evolves into what seems to be a deadly game of puzzle-based survival; the last one standing is to earn ""eternal life"".  On the surface it sounds prime for Layton, and yes, there are puzzles that he must solve in the game...only 4-5 though, and they're not that hard.  The real goal of course is to see where the game takes you story-wise.  Here is where I think the DVD falls on its face.At first everything is pretty intriguing.  The characters and plot seem to be right out of one of the games.  But near the end is where things start to get a bit silly.  I won't give spoilers, but the cover art is basically a spoiler.  The villain?  Layton and Luke both recognize him, but I have no idea from where, because I've never seen him before (no, it's not Don Paulo).  They introduce characters backwards, and they end up being different than....ah, I just can't explain it without spoiling.  Suffice it to say, I ended up fast forwarding through the final 10 or so minutes of the movie due to the disappointment of what really was going on.  I mean it was worse thanProfessor Layton and the Unwound Futurein terms of how the game ended.Perhaps my expectations were too high.  That's entirely possible.  I guess I had hoped that this being a movie, especially a full length one, that it would have gone a more epic direction.  I did not get satisfied there.The saving grace has to be the detail and animation quality.  It doesn't look like DVD quality at all, things are crisp and sharp, especially distance shots where they are driving around a hill or something.  The sheer level of fine detail is amazing, and it draws you into Layton's world.  It's a pity that the backing story just wasn't gripping.IF you're a graphics fanatic, pick this up.  If you like Layton, pick it up, but don't expect anything on the level ofProfessor Layton and the Curious Villagein terms of story.",3,The story telling just isnt there for some reason.,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,3989,"['assume', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'wrote', 'Layton', 'games', 'also', 'had', 'hand', 'writing', 'DVD', 'were', 'times', 'did', 'question', 'entirely', 'possible', ""'m"", 'just', 'being', 'too', 'picky', 'had', 'orderedProfessor', 'Layton', 'Last', 'Specter', 'Amazon', 'botched', 'order', 'somehow', 'Now', 'am', 'debating', 'cancel', 'it.Anyway', 'let', 'start', 'DVD', 'little', 'bit', 'DRM', 'encoded', 'disc', 'totally', 'nerfed', 'Remote', 'Disc', 'capability', 'Mac', 'situation', 'was', 'attempting', 'play', 'myApple', 'iMAC', '27', 'have', 'DVD', 'drive', 'enjoy', 'myApple', 'MacBook', 'Air', 'MC965LL/A', '13.3-Inch', 'Laptop', 'NEWEST', 'VERSION', 'not', 'different', 'room', 'received', 'DRM', 'error', 'moment', 'intro', 'logo', 'played', 'Much', 'chagrin', 'was', 'forced', 'then', 'rip', 'DVD', 'local', 'file', 'could', 'play', 'really', 'wish', 'media', 'houses', 'would', 'get', 'clue', 'Summary', 'least', 'small', 'bit', 'DRM', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'affect', 'majority', 'users', 'playing', 'locally', 'should', ""n't"", 'affect', 'big', 'screen', 'DVD', 'players', 'all.The', 'first', '3', 'so', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'consist', 'previews', 'cutscenes', 'Layton', 'games', 'including', 'Specter', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'larger', 'scale', 'perhaps', 'hope', 'DVD', 'representation', 'OVA', 'one', 'painful', 'watching', 'DS', 'tiny', 'screen', 'clips', 'are', 'quite', 'excellent', 'did', 'hear', 'where', 'voices', 'seemed', 'be', 'drowned', 'out', 'favor', 'backing', 'audio', 'tracks', 'put', 'sound', 'maximum', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'encoded', 'expect', 'user', 'use', 'Dolby', 'Pro', 'Logic', 'II', 'make', 'audio', 'discreet', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'encode', 'Stereo', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'instead', 'then', 'increase', 'vocal', 'subdue', 'music', 'what', 'do', 'know.As', 'video', 'Layton', 'solving', 'puzzle', 'one', 'London', 'clock', 'towers', 'letter', 'former', 'student', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'come', 'see', 'perform', 'opera', 'Luke', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'recall', 'ever', 'being', 'such', 'good', 'singer', 'Things', 'take', 'strange', 'turn', 'opera', 'what', 'be', 'deadly', 'game', 'puzzle-based', 'survival', 'last', 'one', 'standing', 'earn', 'eternal', 'life', 'surface', 'prime', 'Layton', 'yes', 'are', 'puzzles', 'must', 'solve', 'game', 'only', '4-5', ""'re"", 'not', 'hard', 'real', 'goal', 'course', 'see', 'where', 'game', 'story-wise', 'Here', 'where', 'think', 'DVD', 'face.At', 'first', 'everything', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'plot', 'seem', 'be', 'right', 'one', 'games', 'end', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'bit', 'silly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'spoilers', 'cover', 'art', 'basically', 'spoiler', 'villain', 'Layton', 'Luke', 'recognize', 'have', 'idea', 'where', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'not', 'Don', 'Paulo', 'introduce', 'characters', 'backwards', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'different', '.ah', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'spoiling', 'Suffice', 'say', 'ended', 'up', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'final', '10', 'so', 'minutes', 'movie', 'due', 'disappointment', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'going', 'mean', 'was', 'worse', 'thanProfessor', 'Layton', 'Unwound', 'Futurein', 'terms', 'how', 'game', 'expectations', 'were', 'too', 'high', 'entirely', 'possible', 'guess', 'had', 'hoped', 'being', 'movie', 'especially', 'full', 'length', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'more', 'epic', 'direction', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'satisfied', 'there.The', 'saving', 'grace', 'be', 'detail', 'animation', 'quality', ""n't"", 'look', 'DVD', 'quality', 'things', 'are', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'especially', 'distance', 'shots', 'where', 'are', 'driving', 'hill', 'something', 'sheer', 'level', 'fine', 'detail', 'amazing', 'Layton', 'world', 'pity', 'backing', 'story', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'gripping.IF', ""'re"", 'graphics', 'fanatic', 'pick', 'up', 'like', 'Layton', 'pick', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'level', 'Layton', 'Curious', 'Villagein', 'terms', 'story']",N/A
