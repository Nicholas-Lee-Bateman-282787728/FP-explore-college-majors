How you take a story with domestic violence at its core and play much of it as comedy is way beyond my sensibilities.Here's the scoop. Ha-eun is married to Gwak chun-sim who is a champion kickboxer. He beats her regularly on little more than a whim. She's so pitiful even her daughter has no respect for her. On a p.r. boondoggle she challenges him to a kickboxing match. She's so timid and frightened there is no hope of her winning. In another screw-up she signs on to train with a guy who, as it turns out, is a math teacher and doesn't know the first thing about kickboxing. How are they to pull this off?So...we have an early scene where her brute of a husband is beating her and then beats the daughter. These are difficult to watch in their viciousness. She moves out and in with a friend. Then the subsequent match is proposed and she has three months to buck up and become  good enough to beat a man who has just killed his opponent in the ring. This is where things turn comic. I thought I just tuned into some other movie. It does a complete 180. Her trainer is as mild-mannered as she is. He's a middle-aged, single, book-wormish type guy who can't even garner the respect of his students. He drives a heap of a car that stinks like butt and you can't roll down the windows. They train and she starts to feel her oats but she just doesn't have the necessary killer instinct.Then the big match comes. This is a real fairy tale . They did the best they could to pull it off but I wasn't buying it. This was really weird. I liked what they had to say. It was just really cock-eyed. Don't get me wrong. This is a very entertaining watch. You like the characters and you root for who you should root for and you sneer at the villains.The camera work was interesting and Ji-Won To as Ha-eun has the face of an angel. She's a pleasure to watch. Maybe this shouldn't be at the top of your list, but if you happen upon it, it's worth your time.",4,Odd Mix,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,2059,"['producers/writer/director', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'acid', 'when', 'came', 'up', 'one', 'surreal', 'How', 'take', 'story', 'domestic', 'violence', 'core', 'play', 'much', 'comedy', 'way', 'scoop', 'Ha-eun', 'married', 'Gwak', 'chun-sim', 'who', 'champion', 'kickboxer', 'regularly', 'little', 'more', 'whim', 'so', 'pitiful', 'even', 'daughter', 'respect', 'p.r', 'boondoggle', 'kickboxing', 'match', 'so', 'timid', 'frightened', 'hope', 'winning', 'screw-up', 'signs', 'train', 'guy', 'who', 'out', 'math', 'teacher', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'kickboxing', 'How', 'are', 'pull', 'off', 'So', 'have', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'brute', 'husband', 'beating', 'then', 'daughter', 'are', 'difficult', 'watch', 'viciousness', 'out', 'friend', 'Then', 'subsequent', 'match', 'proposed', 'three', 'months', 'buck', 'up', 'become', 'good', 'enough', 'beat', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'killed', 'opponent', 'ring', 'where', 'things', 'turn', 'comic', 'thought', 'just', 'tuned', 'other', 'movie', 'complete', '180', 'trainer', 'as', 'mild-mannered', 'middle-aged', 'single', 'book-wormish', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'garner', 'respect', 'students', 'heap', 'car', 'butt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'roll', 'down', 'windows', 'train', 'feel', 'oats', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'necessary', 'killer', 'instinct.Then', 'big', 'match', 'real', 'fairy', 'tale', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'was', ""n't"", 'buying', 'was', 'really', 'weird', 'liked', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'cock-eyed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'characters', 'root', 'who', 'should', 'root', 'sneer', 'villains.The', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'interesting', 'Ji-Won', 'Ha-eun', 'face', 'angel', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'top', 'list', 'happen', 'time']",Punch Lady

Hatt,"[0, 0]","I liked the story line, since it deals with the topic of spousal abuse and the challenges it poses, especially to the victims and the children in a family.  But I felt the movie was sensationalized and, the concept that the heroine could train for 3 months and develop even marginal MMA skills, completely unrealistic.  That particular element of the movie undermined what might have been a powerful and poignant tale about breaking away from an abusive situation.",2,Lacks the promised punch,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,464,"['liked', 'story', 'line', 'topic', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'challenges', 'especially', 'victims', 'children', 'family', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'sensationalized', 'concept', 'heroine', 'could', 'train', '3', 'months', 'develop', 'even', 'marginal', 'MMA', 'skills', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'particular', 'element', 'movie', 'undermined', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'poignant', 'tale', 'breaking', 'away', 'abusive', 'situation']",Punch Lady
