Jordan ""Voracious Reader""","[0, 0]","I know, the performances are only about an hour at these Montreau shows, so it's not the fault of the DVD itself, although there are zero extras, a big disappointment for me. DVD's can fit so much more content than an hour long show, I wish at least something extra were included. This was a fantastic performance by Lang, and it's well worth adding to one's collection, but this was my 1st Lang purchase. I kind of wish I'd started with something offering a bit more content to begin with and added this later.",5,Just Wish it Were Longer!,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,511,"['know', 'performances', 'are', 'only', 'hour', 'Montreau', 'shows', 'not', 'fault', 'DVD', 'are', 'zero', 'extras', 'big', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'can', 'fit', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'content', 'hour', 'long', 'show', 'wish', 'least', 'something', 'extra', 'were', 'included', 'was', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Lang', 'well', 'worth', 'adding', 'one', 'collection', 'was', '1st', 'Lang', 'purchase', 'kind', 'wish', ""'d"", 'started', 'something', 'offering', 'bit', 'more', 'content', 'begin', 'added', 'later']",Jonny Lang: Live at Montreux 1999

1104084,AT1ALF89PU5OP,B000VT56XQ,"M. Huber ""Michael  Huber""","[1, 2]","Jonny comes out hard and strong on his first song setting a hard to follow standard, but keeps out doing the previous song over and over. Hard to believe a person of that age could portray such soul and feeling into their music. This is a well recorded live take on Jonny's early career. The audio is extremely good and matches their performance. The back up band is well polished, and any one of them could be his father as far as age difference goes. Kind of different to see the reversed age difference. Any one who likes the blues of Joe Bonamassa, Rory Gallagher, SRV, or Gov't Mule will surly appreciate this performance. Highly recommended.I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVD's and Blu-ray's.1. Performance2. Quality of Audio3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)1.*****2.*****3.*****Bands that wish to have there performances recognized and recorded should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it.",5,True Soul Playing,1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,1215,"['Jonny', 'out', 'hard', 'strong', 'first', 'song', 'setting', 'hard', 'follow', 'standard', 'out', 'doing', 'previous', 'song', 'over', 'Hard', 'believe', 'person', 'age', 'could', 'portray', 'such', 'soul', 'feeling', 'music', 'well', 'recorded', 'live', 'take', 'Jonny', 'early', 'career', 'audio', 'extremely', 'good', 'matches', 'performance', 'back', 'up', 'band', 'well', 'polished', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'father', 'as', 'far', 'age', 'difference', 'Kind', 'different', 'see', 'reversed', 'age', 'difference', 'one', 'who', 'blues', 'Joe', 'Bonamassa', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'SRV', ""Gov't"", 'Mule', 'will', 'surly', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'Highly', 'recommended.I', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'had', '3', 'Criteria', 'rating', 'would', 'make', 'quicker', 'more', 'accurate', 'rating', 'Cd', 'DVD', ""Blu-ray's.1"", 'Performance2', 'Quality', 'Audio3', 'Quality', 'Video', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', '1.*****2.*****3', '*****Bands', 'wish', 'have', 'performances', 'recognized', 'recorded', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'standard', 'Poor', 'audio', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'performance', 'still', 'bad', 'product', 'who', 'would', 'still', 'purchase', 'sub-standard', 'audio', 'quality', 'recordings', 'rank', 'product', 'highly', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'industry', 'band', 'justice', 'Demand', 'better', 'will', 'get']",Jonny Lang: Live at Montreux 1999

Wow what a mind blower, this young man (18 at the time) plays and sings with the conviction of a veteran artist. His guitar playing skills are superb, along with his vocals. This is a must for blues or rock fans, he comes off as very much in control of his game. The other guitarist is no slouch either, he also does some fantastic solos. The drummer is excellent along with his bass player, his band is very tight and of very high quality. The songs are all great, they were good choices for this show. The DTS surround adds a lot to the enjoyment of the show, this is one I bought after reading other reviews.
