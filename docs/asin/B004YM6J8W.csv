1433445,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B004YM6J8W,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 6]","Young lawyer Ryan Newman has lost his job and is left feeling depressed and contemplating suicide. Taking up an offer to dogsit his neighbour's pooch, he is bemused to find that he sees Wilfred as a guy in a dog costume, whilst everyone else sees him as a real dog. Wilfred, a pot-smoking connoisseur of movies and TV, befriends Ryan and helps improve his self-confidence...but he also commits random acts seemingly designed to annoy and undermine him. As their relationship develops, Ryan tries to work out who or what Wilfred really is.Wilfred started life as an Australian TV show before being transplanted to the USA, with co-creator/actor Jason Gann reprising his role as the eponymous man/dog/hallucination/whatever. It is a surreal show mixing elements of relationship dramas with comedy, geek-friendly references and even hints of tragedy. The show's central 'mystery' - who or what is Wilfred? - is kept at a fairly low ebb through most of the first season, only really emerging to the fore in the last episode. The creators gleefully play on the audience's past experiences with such mystery-based shows, with Wilfred eventually revealing to Ryan (Elijah 'Frodo Baggins' Wood) his secret is that he needs to get off the Island and evade the smoke monster (""I've seen Lost!"" ""What did you think of the ending?""), to Ryan's frustration.The show's comedy is based around the bizarre relationship between Wilfred and Ryan, with Wilfred expressing canine-like behaviour in human terms but still being susceptible to dog foibles (being distracted by a bubble machine, mesmerised by a laser pointer on a wall or forming a lasting sexual relationship with a stuffed toy). From the other direction, Ryan's self-confidence and ability to form friendships has been eroded to the point where he seems to become psychologically dependent on Wilfred. However, as Ryan recovers his self-esteem he reveals a cold and manipulative side which is surprisingly harsh (and masterfully showcased in the season's grand finale).Whilst there are a few recurring castmembers and some great cameos (My Name is Earl's Ethan Suplee, Malcolm in the Middle's Jane Kaczmarek, The Hangover's Ed Helms and a totally random appearance by Eric Stoltz), the show is mostly a two-hander between Gann and Wood. The two actors are on top form throughout the series, whether it's engaging in a dramatic showdown in the rain on a hospital roof, trying to catch each other out with Dune quotes or assessing Ryan's ability to watch an entire season of The Wire in one sitting (""That stuff is dense!""). Wood undercuts his young clean-cut image through his portrayal of a character who takes drugs and, increasingly as the season progresses, emotionally manipulates those around him, whilst Gann is simply excellent as the morally questionable Wilfred (complete with a slightly surreal English accent he puts on whenever he does anything villainous). Neither character is hugely likable, but they are certainly entertaining.As the season progresses we get more clues as to what is going on (most notably in an episode involving Mary Steenburgen as Ryan's mother, who is in a home for the emotionally bewildered) before the impressive finale, which takes together a number of very minor and apparently unconnected subplots from throughout the season and ties them together neatly to form an impressive cliffhanger. On the negative side, there is a slight feeling of repetitiveness to the premise (though the writers do a good job of keeping things as fresh as possible) and the un-likability of most of the characters occasionally makes watching the show feel slightly pointless, until the next clever line or nice piece of characterisation comes along. However, the episodes are short, sharp and amusing enough to keep things moving along nicely whenever they do start to flag.Wilfred: Season 1 (****) is an entertaining show with a nice line in self-awareness. Whether the premise is strong enough to support multiple seasons (a second season is on its way for next year) remains to be seen, but so far it's worth watching. The show will be released in the next few months in the UK (DVD) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",4,"Surreal, bizarre, funny and hugely watchable.",1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,4177,"['Young', 'lawyer', 'Ryan', 'Newman', 'lost', 'job', 'left', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'contemplating', 'suicide', 'Taking', 'up', 'offer', 'dogsit', 'neighbour', 'pooch', 'bemused', 'find', 'Wilfred', 'guy', 'dog', 'costume', 'whilst', 'everyone', 'else', 'real', 'dog', 'Wilfred', 'pot-smoking', 'connoisseur', 'movies', 'TV', 'Ryan', 'improve', 'self-confidence', 'also', 'random', 'acts', 'seemingly', 'designed', 'annoy', 'undermine', 'relationship', 'Ryan', 'work', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'Wilfred', 'really', 'is.Wilfred', 'started', 'life', 'Australian', 'TV', 'show', 'being', 'transplanted', 'USA', 'co-creator/actor', 'Jason', 'Gann', 'reprising', 'role', 'eponymous', 'man/dog/hallucination/whatever', 'surreal', 'show', 'mixing', 'elements', 'relationship', 'dramas', 'comedy', 'geek-friendly', 'references', 'even', 'hints', 'tragedy', 'show', 'central', ""'mystery"", 'who', 'what', 'Wilfred', 'kept', 'fairly', 'low', 'ebb', 'most', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'really', 'emerging', 'fore', 'last', 'episode', 'creators', 'gleefully', 'play', 'audience', 'past', 'experiences', 'such', 'mystery-based', 'shows', 'Wilfred', 'eventually', 'revealing', 'Ryan', 'Elijah', 'Baggins', 'Wood', 'secret', 'get', 'off', 'Island', 'evade', 'smoke', 'monster', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Lost', 'What', 'did', 'think', 'ending', 'Ryan', 'frustration.The', 'show', 'comedy', 'based', 'bizarre', 'relationship', 'Wilfred', 'Ryan', 'Wilfred', 'expressing', 'canine-like', 'behaviour', 'human', 'terms', 'still', 'being', 'susceptible', 'dog', 'foibles', 'being', 'distracted', 'bubble', 'machine', 'mesmerised', 'laser', 'pointer', 'wall', 'forming', 'lasting', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'stuffed', 'toy', 'other', 'direction', 'Ryan', 'self-confidence', 'ability', 'form', 'friendships', 'been', 'eroded', 'point', 'where', 'become', 'psychologically', 'dependent', 'Wilfred', 'However', 'Ryan', 'recovers', 'self-esteem', 'cold', 'manipulative', 'side', 'surprisingly', 'harsh', 'masterfully', 'showcased', 'season', 'grand', 'finale', '.Whilst', 'are', 'few', 'recurring', 'castmembers', 'great', 'cameos', 'Name', 'Earl', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'Jane', 'Kaczmarek', 'Hangover', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'totally', 'random', 'appearance', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'show', 'mostly', 'two-hander', 'Gann', 'Wood', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'series', 'engaging', 'dramatic', 'showdown', 'rain', 'hospital', 'roof', 'trying', 'catch', 'other', 'out', 'Dune', 'quotes', 'assessing', 'Ryan', 'ability', 'watch', 'entire', 'season', 'Wire', 'one', 'sitting', 'stuff', 'dense', 'Wood', 'young', 'clean-cut', 'image', 'portrayal', 'character', 'who', 'drugs', 'increasingly', 'season', 'emotionally', 'whilst', 'Gann', 'simply', 'excellent', 'morally', 'questionable', 'Wilfred', 'complete', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'English', 'accent', 'whenever', 'anything', 'villainous', 'character', 'hugely', 'likable', 'are', 'certainly', 'season', 'get', 'more', 'clues', 'what', 'going', 'most', 'notably', 'episode', 'involving', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Ryan', 'mother', 'who', 'home', 'emotionally', 'bewildered', 'impressive', 'finale', 'together', 'number', 'very', 'minor', 'apparently', 'unconnected', 'subplots', 'season', 'together', 'neatly', 'form', 'impressive', 'cliffhanger', 'negative', 'side', 'slight', 'feeling', 'repetitiveness', 'premise', 'writers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'things', 'as', 'fresh', 'possible', 'un-likability', 'most', 'characters', 'occasionally', 'watching', 'show', 'feel', 'slightly', 'pointless', 'next', 'clever', 'line', 'nice', 'piece', 'characterisation', 'along', 'However', 'episodes', 'are', 'short', 'sharp', 'amusing', 'enough', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'along', 'nicely', 'whenever', 'do', 'start', 'flag.Wilfred', 'Season', '1', '****', 'entertaining', 'show', 'nice', 'line', 'self-awareness', 'premise', 'strong', 'enough', 'support', 'multiple', 'seasons', 'second', 'season', 'way', 'next', 'year', 'be', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'worth', 'watching', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'UK', 'DVD', 'USA', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray']",N/A

It's seriously unique, that's for sure.  Premise is basic enough, and I'll sum it up in a couple of sentences since you can just look it up yourself.  Ryan (Elijah Wood) is a lost slacker, used-to-be lawyer that tries to commit suicide, and his neighbor who he sort of has a crush on has a dog named Wilfred.  The catch is that only Ryan and the viewers see Wilfred as a grown man in a dog suit; everyone else just sees a dog.That premise is strange enough, right?  Basically, Wilfred is constantly provoking Ryan and making him think, while being kind of a jerk who sets him up a lot to get him in trouble and in messy situations.  He's also sometimes creepy and a total liar.  Not to mention, this dog loves to smoke marijuana, drink booze and smoke cigarettes.  Yet he still does ""dog-like"" things, like being confused over a laser light, being overprotective of his owner, etc.They touch on interesting themes, and have a ""feeling"" at the beginning of every episode that comes from a quote (anger, guilt, whatever).  Sometimes it's difficult to tell when this show is just being weird or is actually smart.  It is thought-provoking and like I said, a little creepy.  It's the perfect recipe for a cult classic, which it pretty much became right away.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[22, 25]","It's a simple but bizarre premise -- a suicidal young man encounters a dog that looks (to him) like an Australian man in a dog costume. Yeah, that's the premise, and it didn't sound any less insane in the original Australian sitcom. But somehow ""Wilfred"" works beautifully, mainly from a combination of clever/dark/gross/twisted humor and the chemistry between Elijah Wood and Jason Gann.Depressed by his joyless life, ex-lawyer Ryan Newman (Wood) tries to commit suicide... and fails miserably, leaving him with no job, a nasty neighbor and an angry pushy sister. Then his beautiful neighbor Jenna (Fiona Gubelmann) asks him to look after her dog Wilfred during the day. Everyone else sees Wilfred as a dog, but Ryan sees him as... well, a pot-smoking Australian man in a dog suit.Ryan soon finds that Wilfred is everything he's not, and ends up being dragged into a celebration of joie de vivre by the devious canine. What comes next is vet trips, angry neighbors, a horrifying doggy daycare, insane single moms, Jenna's jerk boyfriend, Wilfred's ""gift"" for detecting imminent death, a ghostly dog collar, Ryan's similarly loopy mom, and Ryan wondering if he should continue his friendship with the dog.It's never made entirely clear if Wilfred (as Ryan sees him) is real, or if Ryan's unbalanced mind is just making him up to cope with reality. And honestly, ""Wilfred"" is as enjoyable as it is because it leaves you wondering --it's dark, twisted, weird, and gets pretty warped at times (the stories include suicide, drugs, assault, peanut butter, and the molestation of stuffed animals!).And it's HILARIOUS.Well, not all of the humor is twisted -- we have fun scenes like Ryan racing through the streets in a cape, or falling into a giant hole Wilfred dug. But there is a lot of wonderfully weird stuff, from dialogue (""Why is the sky grey? Why is the grass grey? Why is a rainbow grey, grey, grey, grey, grey and infra-grey?"") to the main plots (the peanut butter animal-abuse story, which I cannot recount here... but it's R-rated). And lotsa lotsa four-letter words.However, I also love the pairing of Elijah Wood and Jason Gann. Gann also played Wilfred in the original Aussie series, so this role fits him like a well-worn shoe. He's deadpan, devious and very inappropriate. And Elijah Wood -- an actor who doesn't fit into ""typical"" roles -- is perfectly cast as the wide-eyed, timid, desperate Ryan, whose life quickly turns into a Wilfredcentric hurricane.""Wilfred"" is weird, wild, warped and sometimes wacky -- a dark comedy with a strange premise, which succeeds thanks to its brilliant cast and dark humor.",5,Man's best... uhhh...,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,2621,"['simple', 'bizarre', 'premise', 'suicidal', 'young', 'man', 'dog', 'Australian', 'man', 'dog', 'costume', 'Yeah', 'premise', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'less', 'insane', 'original', 'Australian', 'sitcom', 'somehow', 'Wilfred', 'beautifully', 'mainly', 'combination', 'clever/dark/gross/twisted', 'humor', 'chemistry', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Jason', 'Gann.Depressed', 'joyless', 'life', 'ex-lawyer', 'Ryan', 'Newman', 'Wood', 'commit', 'suicide', 'miserably', 'leaving', 'job', 'nasty', 'neighbor', 'angry', 'pushy', 'sister', 'Then', 'beautiful', 'neighbor', 'Jenna', 'Fiona', 'Gubelmann', 'look', 'dog', 'Wilfred', 'day', 'Everyone', 'else', 'Wilfred', 'dog', 'Ryan', 'well', 'pot-smoking', 'Australian', 'man', 'dog', 'suit.Ryan', 'soon', 'Wilfred', 'everything', 'not', 'up', 'being', 'dragged', 'celebration', 'joie', 'vivre', 'devious', 'canine', 'What', 'next', 'vet', 'trips', 'angry', 'neighbors', 'horrifying', 'doggy', 'daycare', 'insane', 'single', 'moms', 'Jenna', 'jerk', 'boyfriend', 'Wilfred', 'gift', 'detecting', 'imminent', 'death', 'ghostly', 'dog', 'collar', 'Ryan', 'similarly', 'loopy', 'mom', 'Ryan', 'wondering', 'should', 'continue', 'friendship', 'dog.It', 'never', 'made', 'entirely', 'clear', 'Wilfred', 'Ryan', 'real', 'Ryan', 'unbalanced', 'mind', 'just', 'making', 'cope', 'reality', 'honestly', 'Wilfred', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'wondering', 'dark', 'twisted', 'weird', 'pretty', 'warped', 'times', 'stories', 'include', 'suicide', 'drugs', 'assault', 'peanut', 'butter', 'molestation', 'stuffed', 'animals', '.And', 'HILARIOUS.Well', 'not', 'humor', 'twisted', 'have', 'fun', 'scenes', 'Ryan', 'racing', 'streets', 'cape', 'falling', 'giant', 'hole', 'Wilfred', 'dug', 'lot', 'wonderfully', 'weird', 'stuff', 'dialogue', 'Why', 'sky', 'grey', 'Why', 'grass', 'grey', 'Why', 'rainbow', 'grey', 'grey', 'grey', 'grey', 'grey', 'infra-grey', 'main', 'plots', 'peanut', 'butter', 'animal-abuse', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'recount', 'here', 'R-rated', 'lotsa', 'lotsa', 'four-letter', 'words.However', 'also', 'love', 'pairing', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Jason', 'Gann', 'Gann', 'also', 'played', 'Wilfred', 'original', 'Aussie', 'series', 'role', 'well-worn', 'shoe', 'deadpan', 'devious', 'very', 'inappropriate', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'typical', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'wide-eyed', 'timid', 'desperate', 'Ryan', 'life', 'quickly', 'Wilfredcentric', 'hurricane', 'Wilfred', 'weird', 'wild', 'warped', 'sometimes', 'wacky', 'dark', 'comedy', 'strange', 'premise', 'thanks', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'dark', 'humor']",N/A

1433453,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004YM6J8W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 3]","I think it's fair to say that the FX network continues to push the boundaries of conventional TV fare with its slate of provocative adult programming. When I heard they were planning to adapt the Australian comedy ""Wilfred"" (which I knew only by reputation), it seemed like an inspired idea. Better yet, creator and star of the original version Jason Gann was along for the ride. Gann, for those new to the scene, plays Wilfred--an existentialist, pot-smoking dog. Befriending his suicidal slacker of a neighbor (Elijah Wood), Wilfred appears to the loner as a man in a dog suit. Everyone else sees a playful pooch, while Wood is left with a new best friend (and frequent antagonist) to teach him unorthodox life lessons. It is a buddy comedy unlike any other as to see life through Wilfred's eyes can make the world seem completely logical or it can be horrendously demented. It's all rather unpredictable.As such, the television program itself can be a love-it or hate-it proposition. Those that embrace the show's lunatic wisdom will be vocal and avid supporters. Conversely, the high concept and subversive humor is likely to perplex just as many viewers who will dismiss the show as complete garbage. But if a show can elicit strong and passionate feelings, it's doing its job--and, make no mistake, ""Wilfred"" aims to provoke. For myself, I eagerly awaited the arrival of this show. And in truth, I didn't love the first couple of episodes which were offbeat, strange, and lacking in many of the laugh out loud moments that I expected. But I kept watching and the show really got under my skin. The humor can be so off-putting and disturbing and yet it so perfectly fits the tone of the show. I don't know when it happened exactly, but I ended up really loving the show, this friendship, the warped lessons, and the bawdy ridiculousness of its central premise. Is it for everyone? I'd still maintain the answer was no. But there is unexpected depth and compassion under a relatively mean spirited veneer, and it's a winning combination.Season One represents thirteen episodes each based around a central emotion or theme (anger, pride, trust, happiness, acceptance, fear, respect, conscience, compassion, isolation, doubt, sacrifice, and identity). The show's conceit is that this unlikely friendship can help to fix Wood who had all but given up on life. Wilfred exists to provoke Wood out of apathy--to make him feel and live again. But the path to enlightenment never ran smoothly, and the pair is always up to its neck in unexpected trouble. But the faith in friendship wins over adversity every time and what doesn't end Wood only makes him stronger. It's a truly lovely message caught up in a wild mix of bad behavior, sexual innuendo and slapstick shenanigans.Give Wood much credit here. His character does evolve through the season and it's a subtle shift that Wood carries off perfectly. Gann, of course, has a far showier role as Wilfred. Alternately loathsome and surprisingly lovable, Gann maintains the premise's hard edge and unapologetic nastiness to perfection. It would be easy to absolutely hate Wilfred, but that would derail the concept--so Gann walks a tightrope every episode. Ultimately, despite better instincts, you believe in this friendship and see the positive affect for both characters. I can't believe I just wrote that about a man in a dog suit! The show has a few supporting characters (Wood's sister, Wilfred's owner) but it's all about the central bond. Some nice guest moments are provided through-out. Some standouts include Mary Steenburgen as Wood's mom, Chris Klein as a new dominant presence in Wilfred's life, Jane Kaczmarek as an unlikely paramour of Woods, and Ethan Suplee as a hostile neighbor who needs friendship too.

I enjoy british comedies such as Coupling, Monty Python, The IT Crowd, and US shows such as Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Arrested Development, etc.  This shows commercials and clips always made it seem bizarre and perhaps a show for the junkies of the world, perhaps it is, but its not JUST for them.  I feel this shows humor ranges from subtle, to feel-good/inspiring, to in-your-face, twisted.  Some might see a cheap laugh, or what they might consider to be one, but I feel everything in the show has thought behind it.  I don't find any of the characters that 2D at all, and there is plenty of character development and relatable feelings throughout.  Theres plenty of shock value, and a feeling that there is a silver lining around the gloom in life. I would suggest this show to anyone that needs a laugh, plus anyone thats an animal lover, or hater, or might have been depressed, someone that loves to express one self, someone that wants to tell of their boss or family member....really, anyone should be able to enjoy this show provided they aren't offended by fiction or cursing.Buy this, watch this.

1433465,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B004YM6J8W,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","At first glance Wilfred appears to be a ridiculously stupid show, but as a longtime fan and follower of Elijah Wood, I knew he wouldn't agree to do something like that, so I decided to give Wilfred a shot. The show is adapted from a very popular Australian show and if nothing else, it is extremely unique. Wood plays Ryan, a down on his luck man going through some changes. He has a hopeless crush on his new neighbor, Jenna, who to his surprise shows up one day and asks him to watch her dog, Wilfred. The thing about Wilfred is that he is actually a dog, that only Ryan sees as a man in a dog costume. Why does Ryan see Wilfred though, is he an angel, demon, spirit, or is Ryan just hallucinating? That is really the point of the show, Wilfred is there to help and guide Ryan, but what is he and why is Ryan the only one who sees him as human? When I first started watching this show, I thought it was absolutely hysterical. Some of the things Wilfred does and some of the words that come out of his mouth are shocking and hilarious, and how they get away with that on television is beyond me. Unfortunately the initial shock of this nut running around in a dog suit wears off pretty quickly and the episodes seem to blend together. It's a great idea and a unique show, but a lot of the episodes have a very similar storyline and don't really seem to go anywhere. The reason such a weird show works so well is it's extremely talented cast. Elijah Wood has always been a favorite actor of mine and when his quiet, reserved character is matched with Jason Gann and his extreme behavior, it's like watching a whole new take on the Odd Couple. Gann is a newcomer in America and was the one who played Wilfred in the original Australian version of the show. He's been playing Wilfred for years, he's comfortable in the role and none of this is new to him, and that's why he is so terrific. The show Wilfred can be a riot, but it gets old quick, and it's hard listening to moral lessons taught by a pot smoking man in a dog costume. That being said, it might not be the ideal show to watch on DVD as I did, but catching an episode or two on TV can defiantly make your night entertaining.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,2184,"['first', 'glance', 'Wilfred', 'be', 'ridiculously', 'stupid', 'show', 'longtime', 'fan', 'follower', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'agree', 'do', 'something', 'decided', 'give', 'Wilfred', 'shot', 'show', 'adapted', 'very', 'popular', 'Australian', 'show', 'nothing', 'else', 'extremely', 'unique', 'Wood', 'Ryan', 'down', 'luck', 'man', 'going', 'changes', 'hopeless', 'crush', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Jenna', 'who', 'surprise', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'watch', 'dog', 'Wilfred', 'thing', 'Wilfred', 'actually', 'dog', 'only', 'Ryan', 'man', 'dog', 'costume', 'Why', 'Ryan', 'see', 'Wilfred', 'angel', 'demon', 'spirit', 'Ryan', 'just', 'hallucinating', 'really', 'point', 'show', 'Wilfred', 'there', 'help', 'guide', 'Ryan', 'what', 'why', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'human', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'thought', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'things', 'Wilfred', 'words', 'come', 'mouth', 'are', 'shocking', 'hilarious', 'how', 'get', 'away', 'television', 'Unfortunately', 'initial', 'shock', 'nut', 'running', 'around', 'dog', 'suit', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'episodes', 'seem', 'blend', 'together', 'great', 'idea', 'unique', 'show', 'lot', 'episodes', 'have', 'very', 'similar', 'storyline', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'go', 'anywhere', 'reason', 'weird', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'extremely', 'talented', 'cast', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'actor', 'mine', 'when', 'quiet', 'reserved', 'character', 'matched', 'Jason', 'Gann', 'extreme', 'behavior', 'watching', 'whole', 'new', 'take', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'Gann', 'newcomer', 'America', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'played', 'Wilfred', 'original', 'Australian', 'version', 'show', 'been', 'playing', 'Wilfred', 'years', 'comfortable', 'role', 'none', 'new', 'why', 'so', 'terrific', 'show', 'Wilfred', 'can', 'be', 'riot', 'old', 'quick', 'hard', 'listening', 'moral', 'lessons', 'taught', 'pot', 'smoking', 'man', 'dog', 'costume', 'being', 'said', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'ideal', 'show', 'watch', 'DVD', 'did', 'catching', 'episode', 'two', 'TV', 'can', 'defiantly', 'make', 'night', 'entertaining']",N/A
