1017813,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000I0QLKU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","This low-budget exploitative thriller has had a hard life, thanks to a lot of professional critics, moralistic censors, and the typical disdain cast upon it by those who dismiss it as pure sleaze.  Heck, it even had a title that has nothing to do with the movie foisted upon it by its distributor.  When viewed in all of its original, uncut glory, though, this is a darn good film, full of the gritty, in-your-face violence that most directors steer clear of.  Yes, there's nudity, sleaze, violence, and racist elements in this movie, all the things the politically correct crowd wants to protect us from.  Frankly, we're actually quite fortunate this film ever got restored to its original version after suffering two different cinematic castrations robbing it of a full nine minutes.  The holier-than-thou critics certainly aren't happy about it, warning their minions to avoid this sick film, but have none of that, my friends.  We're not little babies who have to be protected from the reality of violence or to be constantly nannied by some self-appointed guardians of cinema.  If ""they"" don't want you to see this movie, that's more than enough reason for you to see it.  As far as regular viewers go, some pin the ""so bad it's good"" label on the movie, but I'm in the ""so good it's good"" camp.  I think opinions are divided based on Nicholas Worth's powerful performance as the killer - to some, he's over the top and almost comical at times, but I think he gives a spot-on performance of a seriously disturbed serial rapist/killer.The killer in this movie has a boring name, no distinguishing characteristics apart from stockiness, never even acquires a media-generated nickname, and has a fetish for women's stockings - but he doesn't let that get him down.  Whatever you think of Nicholas Worth's performance, I think all will agree that it is certainly memorable.  He can charm his way into a house and lure many a young woman to his studio for a photo shoot, only to turn on a dime into a sadistic torturer and killer.  Alone at home - usually working out - his dark side is amply revealed by conversations with himself and his father's spirit.  He is a deranged, formidable killer who actually goes so far as to sell pornographic photos of his victims.Naturally, the cops are working hard to identity and arrest the man going around strangling and sexually abusing (in that order, I might add) young women in Hollywood.  The lead investigators are Lt. Chris McCabe (James Westmoreland), who takes his work very seriously, and Sgt. Hatcher (Ben Frank), who manages to have a good time even (or should I say especially) while investigating the sleaziest of crimes.  Then there's Dr. Lindsay Gale (Flo Lawrence - as Flo Gerrish), a local psychologist with her own radio show, a show which - unbeknownst to her at the time - actually fields several calls from the strangler.  The relationships of these characters actually develop along pretty predictable lines, but that takes little away from the ultimate confrontation at the end.For a low-budget 1980 film made primarily for drive-in audiences, I think this movie is quite impressive.  I don't think the acting is all that bad, the comical elements work quite well (where else are you going to see a lady snorting coke off a bald man's head?), and there's a definite element of suspense leading up to the conclusion.  As for the nudity and violence, it's actually rather tame by today's standards, which makes it even harder for me to understand why some critics seemingly equate this film with low class pornography.  Don't Answer the Phone, for my money, is one of the best movies of its kind.  Don't see it because I told you to, though - see it because ""they"" are telling you not to.  Just make sure you get the uncut version.",4,"In its uncut version, a truly classic exploitation thriller",1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,3793,"['low-budget', 'exploitative', 'thriller', 'had', 'hard', 'life', 'thanks', 'lot', 'professional', 'critics', 'moralistic', 'censors', 'typical', 'disdain', 'cast', 'who', 'dismiss', 'pure', 'sleaze', 'Heck', 'even', 'had', 'title', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'foisted', 'distributor', 'When', 'viewed', 'original', 'uncut', 'glory', 'though', 'darn', 'good', 'film', 'full', 'gritty', 'in-your-face', 'violence', 'most', 'directors', 'steer', 'clear', 'Yes', 'nudity', 'sleaze', 'violence', 'racist', 'elements', 'movie', 'things', 'politically', 'correct', 'crowd', 'protect', 'Frankly', ""'re"", 'actually', 'quite', 'fortunate', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'restored', 'original', 'version', 'suffering', 'two', 'different', 'cinematic', 'castrations', 'robbing', 'full', 'nine', 'minutes', 'holier-than-thou', 'critics', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy', 'warning', 'minions', 'avoid', 'sick', 'film', 'have', 'none', 'friends', ""'re"", 'not', 'little', 'babies', 'who', 'have', 'be', 'protected', 'reality', 'violence', 'be', 'constantly', 'nannied', 'self-appointed', 'guardians', 'cinema', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'more', 'enough', 'reason', 'see', 'As', 'far', 'regular', 'viewers', 'go', 'pin', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'label', 'movie', ""'m"", 'so', 'good', 'good', 'camp', 'think', 'opinions', 'are', 'divided', 'based', 'Nicholas', 'Worth', 'powerful', 'performance', 'killer', 'top', 'almost', 'comical', 'times', 'think', 'spot-on', 'performance', 'seriously', 'disturbed', 'serial', 'rapist/killer.The', 'killer', 'movie', 'boring', 'name', 'distinguishing', 'characteristics', 'apart', 'stockiness', 'never', 'even', 'media-generated', 'nickname', 'fetish', 'women', 'stockings', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'down', 'think', 'Nicholas', 'Worth', 'performance', 'think', 'will', 'agree', 'certainly', 'memorable', 'can', 'charm', 'way', 'house', 'lure', 'many', 'young', 'woman', 'studio', 'photo', 'shoot', 'only', 'turn', 'dime', 'sadistic', 'torturer', 'killer', 'Alone', 'home', 'usually', 'working', 'out', 'dark', 'side', 'amply', 'revealed', 'conversations', 'father', 'spirit', 'deranged', 'formidable', 'killer', 'who', 'actually', 'so', 'far', 'sell', 'pornographic', 'photos', 'victims.Naturally', 'cops', 'are', 'working', 'hard', 'identity', 'arrest', 'man', 'going', 'strangling', 'sexually', 'abusing', 'order', 'might', 'add', 'young', 'women', 'Hollywood', 'lead', 'investigators', 'are', 'Lt.', 'Chris', 'McCabe', 'James', 'Westmoreland', 'who', 'work', 'very', 'seriously', 'Sgt', 'Hatcher', 'Ben', 'Frank', 'who', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'even', 'should', 'say', 'especially', 'investigating', 'sleaziest', 'crimes', 'Then', 'Dr.', 'Lindsay', 'Gale', 'Flo', 'Lawrence', 'Flo', 'Gerrish', 'local', 'psychologist', 'own', 'radio', 'show', 'show', 'unbeknownst', 'time', 'actually', 'several', 'calls', 'strangler', 'relationships', 'characters', 'actually', 'develop', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'lines', 'little', 'away', 'ultimate', 'confrontation', 'end.For', 'low-budget', '1980', 'film', 'made', 'primarily', 'drive-in', 'audiences', 'think', 'movie', 'quite', 'impressive', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'acting', 'bad', 'comical', 'elements', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'where', 'else', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'lady', 'snorting', 'coke', 'off', 'bald', 'man', 'head', 'definite', 'element', 'suspense', 'leading', 'up', 'conclusion', 'nudity', 'violence', 'actually', 'rather', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'even', 'harder', 'understand', 'why', 'critics', 'seemingly', 'equate', 'film', 'low', 'class', 'pornography', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Answer', 'Phone', 'money', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'kind', 'Do', ""n't"", 'see', 'told', 'see', 'are', 'telling', 'not', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'uncut', 'version']",N/A

1017816,A9IZ4H60VZMMT,B000I0QLKU,Herbert West,"[1, 1]","With the release of the restored uncut version of Don't Answer The Phone, we see the Katarina's Nightmare Theater series getting back on track after the disappointing The Day After Halloween (we won't go there). This is a release worthy under their banner, as DATP is a low-budget, sleazy piece of exploitation featuring genre favorite Nicolas Worth (recognizeable to genre fans for his appearance in Wes Craven's Swamp Thing, Darkman, and others).I usually like to go into in-depth reviews, but it's basically like this: Misogynistic cult wierdo photographer goes on a killing spree, strangling women but not before removing their garments for kicks. The violence is unsettling, but as Nicolas states in his interview (and I concur), this really is just a T&A; film at heart, but thats great because without it, the rest of the film wouldn't work. Nicolas' portrayal of the killer is sometimes convincing and other times down right humorous. Just check out some of the faces he makes during his freakout moments (sort of a laughing/crying combo). Maybe it was the beer, but I was hollering.This film is perfect for a late night sleaze sandwich and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was. Too obscure for the casual cult exploitation fan, but for horror die-hards who think they have it all, you will want this in your collection. Just be warned, it is a misogynistic film, so definitely not a first-date kind of film (unless you have a really great date).Keep it up Scorpion Releasing.
