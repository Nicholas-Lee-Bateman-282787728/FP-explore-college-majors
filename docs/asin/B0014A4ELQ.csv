Pearce ""rrobott""","[3, 3]","Although the blurb on the DVD's back cover indicates that this movie is ""Science Fiction"", it is not, except perhaps in the broadest sense, since it is fiction about science, instead.  Events in the movie appear at first to move slowly, but not if you pay close attention to the little details.  The ending throws a curve ball that is quite satisfying.  This film won numerous awards at independent film conclaves.  It deserved them all, although its appeal is mostly cerebral.  Don't expect any special effects, it is not that sort of movie.  It is, however, a profound movie about a rarely addressed aspect of human affairs.  It might be called existential.  It has greatness in it.  It also requires some engagement in the story by the viewer.  Unlike the in-your-face fantasy that currently pervades Hollywood (""Transformers"", the ""Terminator"", movies and such) this movie requires a bit of thought.  It is well worth that effort.",5,SLEEPER,1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,934,"['blurb', 'DVD', 'back', 'cover', 'movie', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'not', 'perhaps', 'broadest', 'sense', 'fiction', 'science', 'instead', 'Events', 'movie', 'appear', 'first', 'move', 'slowly', 'not', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'little', 'details', 'ending', 'curve', 'ball', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'film', 'won', 'numerous', 'awards', 'independent', 'film', 'conclaves', 'deserved', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'cerebral', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'sort', 'movie', 'however', 'profound', 'movie', 'rarely', 'addressed', 'aspect', 'human', 'affairs', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'existential', 'greatness', 'also', 'engagement', 'story', 'viewer', 'in-your-face', 'fantasy', 'currently', 'Hollywood', 'Transformers', 'Terminator', 'movies', 'such', 'movie', 'bit', 'thought', 'well', 'worth', 'effort']",The 4th Dimension

Kudos to the film students who pulled this off on a slim budget.  I would have liked a little more science explained in it.  I did identify with the protagonist's pain and sensitivity.  Living inside your head with persistent tormenting thoughts and undeniable compulsions is a dreadful curse.  A heavy piece of work, but I would watch it again.",4,A movie that makes you think outside the box,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,484,"['like', 'movies', 'skillfully', 'examine', 'mysterious', 'nature', 'time', 'space', 'so', 'idea', 'exploring', 'fourth', 'dimension', 'intrigued', 'Kudos', 'film', 'students', 'who', 'pulled', 'off', 'slim', 'budget', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'little', 'more', 'science', 'explained', 'did', 'identify', 'protagonist', 'pain', 'sensitivity', 'Living', 'head', 'persistent', 'tormenting', 'thoughts', 'undeniable', 'compulsions', 'dreadful', 'curse', 'heavy', 'piece', 'work', 'would', 'watch', 'again']",The 4th Dimension
1145681,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B0014A4ELQ,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","While you might start watching with the expectation of science-fiction, horror, suspense, this atmospheric & compassionate little film isn't really any of those things. It's something better, something richer & more compelling. It's an art film of sorts, if you consider art as the deepest expression of a creator's emotions, composed in such a way that you can't turn from it, because it mesmerizes & provokes a powerful reaction from the viewer. Yet there's none of the pretension that many aspiring art films reach for & fail to grasp -- the creators here are fully in control of their material & know exactly what they want us to see & feel.As previous reviewers have said, it's a cerebral film, without gratuitous action or sex, and certainly no special effects .... except that the lush, evocative B&W; cinematography, and the subtle play of emotions across the lost face of the protagonist, are the best special effects of all. And when I say ""cerebral"" I don't mean emotionally detached, however numb the protagonist might appear at first. This is an achingly heartfelt film that will linger long after the credits roll.The DVD itself is packed with commentaries & extra features, all of which enhance the experience of the film itself. This is proof that someone with real ideas & genuine vision can create work on a shoestring that far outshines the plastic mega-blockbusters of Hollywood. I look forward to subsequent work from these filmmakers, because they've definitely got what it takes -- highly recommended!",4,In search of lost time through a desert of loneliness - 4 & 1/2 stars,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,1524,"['might', 'start', 'watching', 'expectation', 'science-fiction', 'horror', 'suspense', 'atmospheric', 'compassionate', 'little', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'things', 'something', 'better', 'something', 'richer', 'more', 'compelling', 'art', 'film', 'sorts', 'consider', 'art', 'deepest', 'expression', 'creator', 'emotions', 'composed', 'such', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'powerful', 'reaction', 'viewer', 'none', 'pretension', 'many', 'aspiring', 'art', 'films', 'reach', 'fail', 'grasp', 'creators', 'here', 'are', 'fully', 'control', 'material', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'feel.As', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'cerebral', 'film', 'gratuitous', 'action', 'sex', 'certainly', 'special', 'effects', 'lush', 'evocative', 'B', 'W', 'cinematography', 'subtle', 'play', 'emotions', 'lost', 'face', 'protagonist', 'are', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'when', 'say', 'cerebral', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'however', 'protagonist', 'might', 'appear', 'first', 'achingly', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'will', 'linger', 'long', 'credits', 'roll.The', 'DVD', 'packed', 'commentaries', 'extra', 'features', 'enhance', 'experience', 'film', 'proof', 'someone', 'real', 'ideas', 'genuine', 'vision', 'can', 'create', 'work', 'shoestring', 'far', 'plastic', 'mega-blockbusters', 'Hollywood', 'look', 'forward', 'subsequent', 'work', 'filmmakers', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'got', 'what', 'highly', 'recommended']",The 4th Dimension
