636177,AGCOCRW8A56U8,B00005JNV9,buddyhead,"[3, 3]","This movie was a gift, a real sleeper I'd never heard of until my folks recommended it out of the blue.  It's about the slow-building, ultimately intense friendship between two handicapped young men, and their pursuit of independence and love.  There was nothing maudlin or corny about the film, despite tremendous potential for there to have been needless sentimentality.  Nothing relied on artificial or clich&eacute;d devices; even the by-now familiar love triangle didn't develop or resolve predictably.The characters were real and complex, and there was nothing patronizing or preachy in the depiction of their disabilities; viewers are free to dislike the sharp-tongued Rory at times, for instance, in spite of sympathizing with his struggles with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy.  And Michael can be pitied more for his falling too hard for female love interest Siobahn than for his cerebral palsy.  The acting was superb.  James McEvoy's performance in the title role was far superior to his job in Last King of Scotland, and Steven Robertson in particular gave the best portrayal of a handicapped individual that I've seen since Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot.Some laugh out loud moments in the film came as a surprise: watch for scene when the voice-activated lighting is demonstrated to the lads.

Though it had its moments, to me it was more like the cheesy, low-budget after school specials I remember as a kid, and it lacked originality and believability.  What's more, it had a predictable ending.  Stevenson Robertson did a convincing job, but his overdone and overly loud voice grated on my nerves as did the way that his friend interpreted everything he said.  Yet in some important scenes, the actors' voices could barely be heard, such as the scene where the doctor is talking to Robertson near the end about his friend's condition.

While his first words are a little crude, I was immediately charmed and couldn't help but laugh and be entertained!  He has Muscular Dystrophy and enough personality and spirit for 10 men.Michael Connolly is already a permanent fixture in the home.  Having Cerebral Palsy absolutely no one can understand him when he talks.  The home tries to have him point to letters on a card, but that just frustrates everyone because it is so time consuming.  Michael continues to try to talk to people and when Rory hears and understands him, Michael's relief and excitement are palpable.  And so starts the friendship.Rory is a free spirit and longs to be 'normal' his biggest dream is to pass the Independent living application, but when he is rejected again due to his reckless behavior all seems lost.  Luckily Michael is as smart as he is loving and he comes to the rescue, gaining independent living for the two of them.  Free from the home and living on their own, they employ the beautiful and inexperienced Siobhan as their PA.This is probably the most emotional movie I have ever seen, it touches on about every feeling a human can have.  I have never been in a wheelchair or handicapped in any way (knock on wood) so it is impossible to say I could relate to this movie, but I definitely could sympathize and feel their frustrations. I can't imagine what it would be like to have the mind but not the body to do everything you want.  These actors were so good I really thought that they were handicapped.  I thought they got real people with Cerebral Palsy and Muscular Dystrophy to play the roles.This is both a heartwarming and heartbreaking story.

I only had to read one in order to buy the movie, and now I have to add my own 5 stars to the list. I work in a long term care facility, and the movie shows how easy it is for people to become attached to others, especially when they are the one depending on others to help them with the normal activities of daily living. Although it is hard to show what it is truly like to be handicapped in some way (and have it be believable), in such a short span of time, this movie does an excellent job of it.I wish I could say this is a movie for the whole family, but due to the language, it unfortunately isn't. As far as I can see, Rory's favorite word is really the only reason it wouldn't be suitable for children, but even though it is used quite often, it isn't without warrant. The expletives help paint a better picture of how frustrating it is to be 'different' than most other people and wish you could be 'normal' and able to take care of yourself.

636186,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005JNV9,Kevin Killian,"[3, 5]","I'm not surprised the movie is getting all sorts of five star reviews.  It's sort of cheesy, that's what they're not telling you, but the star power is such that Romola Garai and James McAvoy make it worth watching.  Steven Robertson is an acquired taste and I got sick of him right away.  Even when Siobhan (Romola Garai) gave him a new haircut, he didn't improve in my eyes, and I think looking back offering him that ""regular boy's"" haircut was a mistake, because it encouraged him to think that, like Pinocchio, he could become a real boy.  Tragically because she was so nice to him, in her understated way, he began to misread her affectionate ways for signs of real love and then--SPOILERS AHEADHe went off the trolley at a party when he saw her dancing with a non-disabled boyfriend.  How banal is the movie?  I'll tell you how banal--they had to go make it a costume party, for no reason at all!  They're always doing that in the movies, a sign of not believing enough in their own material.  It can't just be a regular party party, that's not pictorial enough, they have to put everyone in costumes.  So you get McEvoy dressed up as Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean and two extras cast for their Laurel and Hardy act, it's all horribly dire, especially in the face of the fact that this social occasion represents the first time that the central trio's ""Jules et Jim"" romance is put to the test.  So it's supposed to be the turning point of the whole drama, but how can we pay attention, when the screen is cluttered with Cleopatras and French maids.I don't know about the politics of casting non-disabled actors to fill those wheelchairs, but the actors were up to the challenge.  When McEvoy asks Robertson if he gets excited when Garai gives him his nightly spongebath, the two men play it like it was the first time they ever got to be frank in the movies.  Their exhilaration is contagious, too bad the whole movie had to succumb to the Ali MacGraw level of script predictability.",3,"Two Guys, a Girl, Two Chairs, One Bar of Soap",1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,2001,"[""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'movie', 'getting', 'sorts', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'sort', 'cheesy', 'what', ""'re"", 'not', 'telling', 'star', 'power', 'such', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'Steven', 'Robertson', 'acquired', 'taste', 'got', 'sick', 'right', 'away', 'Even', 'when', 'Siobhan', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'gave', 'new', 'haircut', 'did', ""n't"", 'improve', 'eyes', 'think', 'looking', 'back', 'offering', 'regular', 'boy', 'haircut', 'was', 'mistake', 'encouraged', 'think', 'Pinocchio', 'could', 'become', 'real', 'boy', 'Tragically', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'understated', 'way', 'began', 'misread', 'affectionate', 'ways', 'signs', 'real', 'love', 'then', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEADHe', 'went', 'trolley', 'party', 'when', 'saw', 'dancing', 'non-disabled', 'boyfriend', 'How', 'banal', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'how', 'banal', 'had', 'go', 'make', 'costume', 'party', 'reason', ""'re"", 'always', 'doing', 'movies', 'sign', 'not', 'believing', 'enough', 'own', 'material', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'regular', 'party', 'party', 'not', 'pictorial', 'enough', 'have', 'put', 'everyone', 'costumes', 'So', 'get', 'McEvoy', 'dressed', 'up', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'two', 'extras', 'cast', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'act', 'horribly', 'dire', 'especially', 'face', 'fact', 'social', 'occasion', 'first', 'time', 'central', 'trio', 'Jules', 'et', 'Jim', 'romance', 'put', 'test', 'supposed', 'be', 'turning', 'point', 'whole', 'drama', 'how', 'can', 'pay', 'attention', 'when', 'screen', 'cluttered', 'Cleopatras', 'French', 'maids.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'politics', 'casting', 'non-disabled', 'actors', 'fill', 'wheelchairs', 'actors', 'were', 'up', 'challenge', 'When', 'McEvoy', 'Robertson', 'excited', 'when', 'Garai', 'nightly', 'spongebath', 'two', 'men', 'play', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'got', 'be', 'frank', 'movies', 'exhilaration', 'contagious', 'too', 'bad', 'whole', 'movie', 'had', 'succumb', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'level', 'script', 'predictability']",N/A
636187,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNV9,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 3]","Living without anyone being able to understand what one is saying might be very difficult, but if one never has had anyone understand them it's all one expects out of life.  This is the case for Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson) who suffers from cerebral palsy, which gives him the inability to control the movement of his muscles.  However, through decades of training he has developed some movements, even though it is extremely difficult for him to control the movement.  At Carrigmore - A Home for Special People Michael has learned to communicate through slowly pointing on an alphabet board, but it is a very tedious accomplishment even when it comes to expressing a few words.  But it is all he knows, the life within Carrigmore.Damien O'Donnell, a name some might recognize from films such as Heartlands (2002) and East is East (1999), has created a poignant film about two young men that both are wheelchair bound.  In addition to Michael, the rebellious Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) has just arrived to the Carrigmore where he quickly makes himself known as a troublemaker.  However, he has one unique gift, he can understand what Michael is saying.  Michael for the first time experiences what chatting is about and feels ecstatic about this, to most trivial, but to him a precious and extraordinary event.  They quickly become friends, as Michael has no one else to talk to and Rory has no one that listens to him.Rory takes it on himself to teach Michael about life outside Carrigmore of which he is completely unaware.  For the first time he got to drink alcohol and feel the rouse of drunkenness along with the warm touch of a woman's kiss.  There are many firsts for Michael, who for the first time gets to experience life and the freedom that life can bring while outside an institutional setting with the constant attention and rules.  Blissful Michael embraces what he learns from Rory, as he also learns that they can apply for independent living.Rory O'Shea Was Here delivers different views of life than what the brilliant The Sea Inside (2004) does which deals with a quadriplegic that desires to end his life.  Here the main character strives to experience life, as all he has known is the restricted life within an institution.  The major difference is with the protagonist in The Sea Inside, as he had lived life to the fullest before his life was suddenly snatched away through a tragic accident after which he lived in a bed for decades.  The difference can be experienced through Michael who vividly experiences the smallest changes as great adventures.  Well, I cannot judge one or the other; it is their life and their life to live.  However, it is a very positive feeling that arouses when one can observe Michael learn new simple things in life.One thing that O'Donnell considers in his film is that life is not always pleasant, which he also addresses through a couple of riveting scenes.

In addition, the performances by Steven Robertson and James McAvoy are remarkable, as they help make the film feel even more genuine.

I distrusted the review because the reviewer made the assertion that ""Rory would approve of calling these characters 'gimps.' The reviewer makes this claim after using the word. Rory may well have approved, but as a fictional character he can obviously not be asked. Speaking as a person with cerebral palsy I for one do not approve any more than a black man would ""approve"" of a white man using the ""N"" word. As such I disregarded the review in its entirety suspecting that the author didn't know anything about the disability experience.I didn't get to see ""Rory O'Shea"" during its treatrical run, it was in and out in less than a week, and deservedly so. My first question is why can't we ever get a character with CP who does not have speech difficulty? I know we're in the minority of a minority, but we do exist!Second, what's with the shower scenes? If memory serves, there were three and only one with a discernable ""purpose."" What were the others meant to illustrate? That people with disabilities do  indeed bathe?Third, ""Rory O'Shea"" steps right into a trap seen countless times before, his friend/assistant calls him an ""arsehole"" and he deserved it and had the screenwriter left it at that it would have been a rare bit of insight. But no, the screenwriter had to phrase it in the obligatory way, ""You know what a disability is? You're an arsehole.""One thing ""Rory O'Shea"" gets dead-on perfect is the caregiver interview scene, it earns its second-star on that alone.One cliche I wish ""Rory O'Shea WOULD have used is the good ol' ""georgious girl has a change of heart and comes back to the man she rejected"" just in the name of equal opportunityLastly, my biggest gripe about Rory O'Shea himself is that he is so unrelentingly obnoxious from beginning to end.

Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) is a roguish young man confined to a wheelchair with muscular dystrophy, his voice and two fingers his only functioning faculties. When he goes to live at Carrigmore Home for the Disabled, a pretty and pleasant institution, unfortunately without opportunity for self-determination or anything even mildly exciting, his boisterous personality shakes the place up a bit. Michael Conolly (Steven Robertson), who is also wheelchair-bound and suffers from severe speech impairment due to cerebral palsy, is resigned to the monotony and confinement in the home. But when he finds that Rory can understand his speech, Michael seeks his friendship, and Rory's quest to live independently rubs off on him.""Rory O'Shea Was Here"" succeeds because it's honest. Rory and Michael are real, flawed, and lively personalities. The film doesn't romanticize disability or claim that there is anything enriching about it. It doesn't hesitate to laugh at the everyday challenges of being disabled either. And the cast is great. Neither James McAvoy or Steven Robertson are disabled, but they work very hard to hide that fact. Robertson's body language and his barely intelligible speech are amazing. McAvoy makes Rory lovable, charismatic, and frustrating. Romola Garai is a chameleon in her role as Siobhan, the men's personal assistant. I'm used to seeing her in period films and didn't recognize her, but she's terrific. This isn't really a film about people overcoming obstacles or living with them. It's about life's frustrations, which are easily taken out on someone else in a home, but can be a good deal more complicated where there is no one to blame. Like so many Irish films, ""Rory O'Shea Was Here"" has a vitality and unsentimental humor that makes it a pleasure to watch.The  DVD (Universal 2005 release): There are 3 deleted scenes, including an alternate ending, and 1 extended scene.

Rory's gift of understanding became instrumental in Michael's freedom from the confines of institutional living. Michael's tactful application and a suitable apartment they both convinced his now successful father to pay for, allows them to explore the meaning of independence, establishing a friendship between two very different personalities.A beautiful young woman, named Siobhan (Romola Garai) agrees to work for them as their independent aide, helping them get settled and caring for them with remarkable devotion. They first met when she rescued them from a fight earlier in the movie during the two guys' escape to a local pub, spending the collection money they've just raised that afternoon on drinks with two other women they've met as Rory's wicked idea of showing Michael a good time. Rory's bad manners, intermittent use of profanity, risky behavior, and suggestive sarcasm contrasts sharply with Michael's modest, shy, and law-abiding demeanor. Yet the two find strength and inspiration in each other as their emotional bond with Siobhan deepens with gratitude and admiration.The three characters complete each other, giving each a sense of higher purpose and meaningful relationship with one another.

After months of reading reviews and contenting myself with watching the trailer and assorted clips, I finally had the chance to become acquainted with Rory O'Shea.""Rory O'Shea Was Here"" centers on the lives of two young men trapped in Carrigmore, a Dublin care home ""for special people."" Lifelong resident Michael Connelly has cerebral palsy, which leaves him with tremors, limited manual dexterity (he is a wheelchair user), and a severe speech impairment.  Abandoned by his famous barrister father, quiet, shy Michael is intelligent, but is frustrated by his lack of ability to communicate.  He is reduced to pointing at letters on a chart, since his speech comes out as a series of grunts and moans.  He has resigned himself to a dull existence at Carrigmore, forced to watch children's cartoons with the other patients.All of this changes with the arrival of Rory O'Shea, a twenty-year-old punk in a motorized wheelchair, completely paralyzed except for two fingers by advanced Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  Rory bursts into placid Carrigmore like an angry whirlwind, all leather, spiked hair, and a nose ring, offering a scathing nonstop commentary.  He quickly angers supervisor Eileen (Brenda Fricker, My Left Foot) by blasting Slipknot in the middle of the night, and seeks an accomplice to gel his hair once the nurses are banned to do so.Quiet, rule-abiding Michael resents the loud, obnoxious Rory, until he discovers that Rory can understand his laboured speech and act as his interpreter.  Michael becomes Rory's partner in crime as the two sneak off on a pub crawl during a collection, cementing an unlikely friendship and giving Michael a taste of the world outside.  Michael is inspired to apply for an independent living grant so that the two can have their own flat and carer (Rory has been turned down three times for his irresponsibility), on the condition that Rory comes with him to serve as interpreter.The rest of the film centers on their adjustments to living on their own, and the daily trials and tribulations the two face.  They hire Siobhan, a beautiful young woman that they met at a club, as their live-in carer.  At first, the threesome share in good times, feasting on delicacies and going for walks in the park, but the two men soon fall for Siobhan, Michael openly and Rory secretly.  We are witness to Michael's painful humiliation and Rory's broken heart, hidden by venomous comments and a tough exterior.  The growing tension threatens to rip the fabric of their new life apart, but it takes a crisis to show them the meaning of friendship.Rory and Michael teach us important lessons through the tears and smiles: to accept without pitying, to live every day to its fullest, to not be afraid to take chances.  The film walks a delicate line between humor and drama, with plenty of searing one-liners from Rory and more serious reflections on abandonment, fear, and loneliness.  By the end of the film, there is no doubt that ""Rory O'Shea Was Here.""(""Rory O'Shea Was Here"" will be released on DVD on June 14, containing trailers, outtakes, and an alternate ending.

The acting is wonderful and I never felt the movie made fun of the disabled. I have a disabled son who watched it with me a few nights ago and he thought the film was touching. He loved the spunk of Rory O'Shea and how he taught Michael with his sense of humor. Rory was sensitive and concerned about Michael.I recommend the film highly.
