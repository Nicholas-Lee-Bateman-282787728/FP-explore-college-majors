She walks out but is forced to return to the job after she cannot pay for gas and after her husband's near breakdown at the families imminent loss. she is crying when she phones to return to the job and vomits after her first treatment of a client.But later she becomes the most popular girl in the business and hiding her profession from her freidns and family brings home heaps of money and is able to give her family what they need.Later of course when the business is bust due to the machinations of a politician among to be re-elected and a local church group, heartbreak will ensueSamantha Horton is a beautiful woman both inside and out-the women who she works all are people with great big hearts. Jeniffer Love Hewitt plays the role with an endearing combination of both strength and vulnerability. Shows us that anyone can fall on desperate times and out of desperation woman can be driven to sell their bodies. Prostitutes are human beings, often with bigger hearts than many saints and we can all learn to judge people who have been through so much less harshly and find some compassion. the answer is to ensure no women have to do this.A society is nothing if it does not put at the very heart of its policy considerations, the welfare of the vulnerable in society.

But it is worth watching as a testimony of the hard times the greed and short-sight and intellectual infatuation of the financiers of Wall Street brought up onto us and mostly only us.It was called subprime and foreclosure in the USA and it is called public debt in Europe.Then the film shows the consequences for individuals and not for the country or society at large. And the response from these individuals is purely individualistic even egocentric. The case here is a mother who is a certified physical therapist who becomes a masseuse in a spa for gentlemen, you can imagine what it is and also the kind of clients she gets.She does it at first because that saves the mortgage, that saves the family from bankruptcy and because that saves her self esteem by making her rich, awfully wealthy over night, but she does not see that she is destroying her own self, her own family, and that she is losing everything she accepted that extreme activity for. And in the end there is nothing but a court, a deal on the basis of the list of customers and the scandal the publishing of this list brings in the community.Then there are surprising reactions. The wives of the customers want to get private lessons on matrimonial sex, what to do with the banana and the two apples. Then her mother understands that she should have emphasized the beauty of her daughter less and her intelligence more. Then the community is brought to some modesty and humility (by the list of course) and they learn how to forgive, starting from the pulpit. Finally the husband and the children, the husband essentially (as shown in the film: I pity the kids at school, they must have gotten horrendous moments) learns how to forgive and to start all over again, not quite all  but mostly what counts, family life and love, because love can survive such horrible moments in life.

1375571,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003Y5HWIQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[43, 49]","In the world of Lifetime movies, there are two basic genres.  ONE:  A woman triumphing over hardship, adversity, or abuse in a tough, but life affirming, ""based on real incidents"" TV docudrama.  And TWO:  The prurient ""ripped from the headline"" scandal or crime story that borrow from real cases and wallow in distasteful dramatic recreations.  2010's ""The Client List"" is a film that has the lucky distinction of representing both of these types in its tawdry tale of a wife and mother turned prostitute.  You have a certain expectation, or at least I do, when I approach such material.  While most Lifetime movies aren't particularly good, they can have a camp appeal that I appreciate.  And as such, ""The Client List"" has some horrendous moments that rival the best in bad TV!  But ""The Client List"" stands out in another way, as well.  Its lead, Jennifer Love Hewitt, was actually nominated for a Golden Globe for this epic!I won't bag on Hewitt, she's a likable performer, and there is a role of hers from 2010 that might deserve award attention.  Unfortunately it's not for this--it's for her dramatic guest turn on ""SVU"" which might be one of the best things she's done in years!  No, Hewitt isn't the fundamental problem of ""The Client List""--it's the script.  When we meet Hewitt, she and her husband are off to see the bank about getting a loan extension.  They've hit on hard times with 3 kids and are minutes away from having their home foreclosed.  They both sex it up (really!) to get the deferral from the evil banker.  Seriously the first 15 minutes of ""The Client List"" with this scene, as well as the interaction with Hewitt's mama Cybill Shepherd, are so silly--it's enough to set women (and Texas) back 20 years.  Hewitt seeks a job in this downturned economy, and before you can say ""Swedish"" or ""Shiatsu""--she's turning tricks in a massage parlor.SMALL SPOILERS:  Hewitt wrestles with this decision periodically, but it's not with the soul crushing devastation you might anticipate.  Hey, she's just a good wife and mother supporting her brood.  She still cooks for the bake sale.  She is super sweet to her clients--she cares!  There isn't one moment, even descending into drug addiction, that we're meant to see Hewitt in a remotely negative light.  She may have made a mistake, sure, but she's human--okay?  Then when the world comes crashing down (you knew it was coming!), Hewitt gets by with a slap because she rats out all her clients that gave her the lifestyle that she that was charging for.  The men are bad!  She, and indeed the whole establishment, were just victims.I make it sound so terrible, but it's exactly what I expected--so I can't be too hard.  It's relatively entertaining nonsense.  However, there is one scene near the end when the town's women confront Hewitt at her home.  This sequence might be the most awkward and ridiculous thing I've seen all year.  This scene, in itself, is SOOOOO BAAAD that I'm tempted to rate this one star on that alone.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[14, 22]","Hey, it's a LIFETIME Network movie about Prostitution written by a woman - not a major feature film.I actually wanted to see this film for Cybil Shepherd, who I admire as an actress, having watched her grow from her role as the small-town Texas teenage beauty queen in The Last Picture Show. (Now she is playing the mother of a similar character!)I'm not that familiar with Jennifer Love Hewitt, but I'm sure I've seen her in films. She is the ""star"" of this BOATS (Based on a true story) cable TV movie. It was made for the female-targeted Lifetime Network, and the script was written by a female, so some might call it a ""women's movie"". And though the subject is prostitution, there are no organized crime men running the operation. It's all women! And, beside the fact that they are paying for sex, the only male who is dangerous to the women - at least as depicted in the film - is the one John who gives (and letter ""sells"") Love Hewitt cocaine. Because this is a TV film it has no rating but only ""Language"" is noted on the package. There is no violence and even the language is mild. I don't even remember hearing a ""curse"" word.How you feel about prostitution, and whether it is a victimless crime, may determine if you like or dislike this film. But, that's not really a determining factor, in my opinion.The storyline signals the next step all the way through. Love Hewitt emotes a lot but - even when she's home alone after serving 30 days in prison (okay, spoiler alert there) she has tons of eye shadow and never, never seems to be without those HUGH fake eyelashes. In fact her makeup remains the same whether she is ""working"" her clients or pleading in front of a judge, or at her daughter's birthday party.Her husband is played by Teddy Sears as a pretty wimpy guy who was once a football jock. He's had a knee injury but we aren't sure why he can't hold down another job.If you missed it on TV, and are a JLH fan, this might be an okay film to pick up. (And Shepherd fans won't find her on screen for much of the film.)
