They are the type that acts with their eyes, their face, their entire body, and project integrated conflicts inside out. The believable, comically, humanistic, and never over-the-top characterizations of each family member in this drama are the strongest point of this movie. I became sympathetic not only to the protagonist, but also to almost every single character in this movie from the get-go, which is rare for me.",4,Well done!,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,687,"['seeing', 'so', 'many', 'low-budget', 'poorly', 'made', 'American', 'as', 'well', 'foreign-made', 'GLBT', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'extremely', 'refreshing', 'see', 'such', 'high-production', 'well-directed', 'well-acted', 'well-scripted', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'actors', 'have', 'chops', 'are', 'type', 'eyes', 'face', 'entire', 'body', 'project', 'integrated', 'conflicts', 'believable', 'comically', 'humanistic', 'never', 'over-the-top', 'characterizations', 'family', 'member', 'drama', 'are', 'strongest', 'point', 'movie', 'became', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'only', 'protagonist', 'also', 'almost', 'single', 'character', 'movie', 'get-go', 'rare']",N/A

However, what is new here is the way in which this theme is told, the richness and layers of detail of the storytelling and the beautiful way in which the film was made. If you like the cinematography in Bertolucci films (e.g., Stealing Beauty, Last Emperor), that golden, magic light of a day's closing in Tuscany, you will love the cinematography here. The trailer for this movie does not do justice to the depth, detail, twists and turns of the story in the film. The trailer would lead you to believe this is a comedic romp. There is comedy, but it is not the heart of the film. There are excellent performances by all of the actors in this film, I didn't detect a false moment anywhere.

1379463,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0040JWUY6,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Turkish writer/director Ferzan Ozpetek (His Secret Life, Saturn in Opposition, Facing Windows, Sacred Heart, Steam:The Turkish Bath, etc) has created yet another sensitive, warmly humorous, intelligent movie in LOOSE CANNONS (MINE VAGANTI), a film he co-wrote with Ivan Cotroneo. The film is filled with an extraordinary cast of Italian actors, most of whom we do not know but who deliver some of the most memorable characterizations in recent years. The title for the film `loose cannons' refers to an irresponsible and reckless individual whose behavior (either intended or unintended) endangers the group he or she belongs to. There could not be a better title for this film that examines family life in contemporary Italy.The film opens with a prelude of a beautiful woman in a bridal gown running across the fields toward the ancient house where she embraces a man Nicola (Giorgio Marchesi, watch his star rise!) and then is lead to her planned wedding to another man. The story then begins. Tommaso (Riccardo Scamarcio) is the youngest son of the Cantone family who own and operate a pasta factory in southern Italy. At a family dinner, parents Vincenzo (Ennio Fantastichini) and Stefania (Lunetta Savino) Cantone plan on turning over the factory to their two sons, Antonio Cantone (Alessandro Preziosi) and Tommaso Cantone. The younger Tommaso, who has returned home from business school in Rome for this dinner, has his own important news that he plans on divulging at that dinner. Beforehand, he tells Antonio his news. He is not in business school and is not at all interested in running the factory, leaving that to Antonio. Rather, he wants to stay in Rome to be a writer - he has submitted a manuscript of a novel to a publisher - but more importantly that he is gay. Tommaso is certain that their parents will respond with anger and be non-supportive. But before Tommaso can make his statement at the dinner, Antonio, who has been working at the factory for years, drops his own bombshell of news that HE is gay on the family, which results in Vincenzo disowning Antonio and having a mild heart attack. Tommaso feels that he has no other choice now but to keep quiet, stay in the closet, and remain at home to run the factory while his father recuperates. A beautiful worker at the factory, Teresa (Paola Minaccioni) though she has problems of her own, is supportive and close to Tommaso, giving the family the idea that all is `straight' with Tommaso. But a visit from Rome by Tommaso's flamboyant gay friends - including Tommaso's lover, Marco (Carmine Recano) - may make life difficult for Tommaso as he tries to balance his priorities in life. His sister Elena (Bianca Nappi) reassures Tommaso that she has know of his sexual preference for years and loves him just the same. Tommaso's paternal grandmother (Ilaria Occhini) who started the factory, who is known as the loose cannon of the family and who has a long kept secret of her own, may have her own say in what happens in the family. The ending of the film draws all the conflicts to conclusion in a deeply tender fashion.The cast is large and consistently excellent. But it is Ozpetek's genius that shines though in controlling every aspect of this very rewarding film. Another treasure from Italy. In Italian with English subtitles.

1379464,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B0040JWUY6,J. Martin,"[14, 14]","Loose Cannons is a beautiful movie about a young gay man in a large, loving and eccentric Southern Italian family. His plan to free himself from the family pasta business by coming out as gay misfires early in the movie, and the remaining ninety minutes cover how his dilemma is resolved.But this is far, far more than a coming-out movie. Themes of life and death and immortality and family and love lost and found run like deep, rich rivers of life throughout the story, and it is astonishing how much emotional ground is covered so effectively in just one movie. Each one of the dozen or so highly differentiated characters is fully and richly developed, and not one of them is short-changed or stereotyped.I got Loose Cannons because I have loved the earlier works of Ferzan Ozpetec, particularlyHis Secret Life,Facing Windows,Sacred Heart, and - most of all -Saturn in Opposition, but Loose Cannons surpasses them all. Each of its predecessors had minor flaws and occasional weak moments, but Loose Cannons has none.As usual in his movies, photography, sets and music are highly original and perfectly fitted to the story: if it were a silent movie it would be beautiful just to look at; if it were a radio program it would be delightful just to listen to. This is the first of his movies to integrate a significant amount of comedy into his usually serious but highly imaginative dramas, and he does it expertly; I laughed out loud almost as often as I wept with delight.This movie is a masterpiece. I cannot imagine how a better movie could ever be made, but Ozpetec is young still, so I am confident he will do it somehow. I can say without any reservation at all that this is the best movie I have ever seen.(In Italian with excellent English subtitles, but the Italian DVD available as of May 2011 has no subtitles for the extensive extra materials.)",5,"A stunning, beautiful, delightful masterpiece",1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,1859,"['Loose', 'Cannons', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'large', 'loving', 'eccentric', 'Southern', 'Italian', 'family', 'plan', 'free', 'family', 'pasta', 'business', 'coming', 'out', 'gay', 'misfires', 'early', 'movie', 'remaining', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'cover', 'how', 'dilemma', 'resolved.But', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'coming-out', 'movie', 'Themes', 'life', 'death', 'immortality', 'family', 'love', 'lost', 'found', 'run', 'deep', 'rich', 'rivers', 'life', 'story', 'astonishing', 'how', 'much', 'emotional', 'ground', 'covered', 'so', 'effectively', 'just', 'one', 'movie', 'one', 'dozen', 'so', 'highly', 'differentiated', 'characters', 'fully', 'richly', 'developed', 'not', 'one', 'short-changed', 'stereotyped.I', 'got', 'Loose', 'Cannons', 'have', 'loved', 'earlier', 'works', 'Ferzan', 'Ozpetec', 'particularlyHis', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Facing', 'Windows', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'most', '-Saturn', 'Opposition', 'Loose', 'Cannons', 'predecessors', 'had', 'minor', 'flaws', 'occasional', 'weak', 'moments', 'Loose', 'Cannons', 'none.As', 'usual', 'movies', 'photography', 'sets', 'music', 'are', 'highly', 'original', 'perfectly', 'fitted', 'story', 'were', 'silent', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'beautiful', 'just', 'look', 'were', 'radio', 'program', 'would', 'be', 'delightful', 'just', 'listen', 'first', 'movies', 'integrate', 'significant', 'amount', 'comedy', 'usually', 'serious', 'highly', 'imaginative', 'dramas', 'expertly', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'almost', 'as', 'often', 'wept', 'delight.This', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'how', 'better', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'Ozpetec', 'young', 'still', 'am', 'confident', 'will', 'do', 'somehow', 'can', 'say', 'reservation', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Italian', 'excellent', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Italian', 'DVD', 'available', 'May', '2011', 'subtitles', 'extensive', 'extra', 'materials']",N/A

This is one of those films that comes along far too rarely and when it does, you remember what the magic of cinema really is. This is set in Paloma, where a rich family of pasta makers, are going through a change. The patriarch wants to hand the reins of the very profitable business over to his two sons.The elder Antonio has stayed to run the factory and put his life on hold for the goodness of the family. His younger brother Tomasso (Riccardo Scamarcio), has been in Rome allegedly studying business, whilst actually indulging his love of literature instead. That is one of his loves, the other happens to be a man. He tells Antonio the night before the surprise family dinner where all is to be handed over, that he will come out the following night. Antonio tries to talk him out of it, all to no avail.The following night though Antonio surprises everyone by coming out first! The ruddy cheek - and their father quite literally has a fit. He banishes Antonio claiming all he now has left is Tomasso.That is the stage setting for a wonderfully crafted film, of love jealousy, envy, bigotry and life. All of the characters are developed and all get their time in the lime light - even the maids. That is one aspect of Director Ozpetek's attitude I really like. The `loose cannon' is a reference to Tomasso's Grand Mother, she is the all knowing and understanding heart of the family. She has the sort of advice that you just don't get any more - like ""If you always do what others want, life is not worth living"".There is so much going on from the alcoholic aunt, the looked over sister, the ageing mistress of their father and the towns relentless gossip, that the pace never lets up. It gets even better when Tomasso's boyfriend and close mates all turn up to make sure he is ok.This is one of the most human and touching yet funny films I have seen in a while, whilst it is gay themed it is really about relationships and family prejudices based on what the neighbours might say. It is in Italian with excellent sub titles and is a must for any fan of World cinema, oh and as it's Italian it is totally stylish too- can not recommend highly enough.",5,Fantastic Italian Romp!,1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,2250,"['had', 'meant', 'catch', 'cinema', 'when', 'Peccadillo', 'brought', 'out', 'sadly', 'missed', 'one', 'films', 'along', 'far', 'too', 'rarely', 'when', 'remember', 'what', 'magic', 'cinema', 'really', 'set', 'Paloma', 'where', 'rich', 'family', 'pasta', 'makers', 'are', 'going', 'change', 'patriarch', 'hand', 'reins', 'very', 'profitable', 'business', 'two', 'sons.The', 'elder', 'Antonio', 'stayed', 'run', 'factory', 'put', 'life', 'hold', 'goodness', 'family', 'younger', 'brother', 'Tomasso', 'Riccardo', 'Scamarcio', 'been', 'Rome', 'allegedly', 'studying', 'business', 'whilst', 'actually', 'indulging', 'love', 'literature', 'instead', 'one', 'loves', 'other', 'be', 'man', 'night', 'surprise', 'family', 'dinner', 'where', 'be', 'handed', 'over', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'following', 'night', 'Antonio', 'talk', 'avail.The', 'following', 'night', 'Antonio', 'everyone', 'coming', 'out', 'first', 'ruddy', 'cheek', 'father', 'quite', 'literally', 'fit', 'Antonio', 'claiming', 'all', 'now', 'left', 'stage', 'setting', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'film', 'love', 'jealousy', 'envy', 'bigotry', 'life', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'get', 'time', 'lime', 'light', 'even', 'maids', 'one', 'aspect', 'Director', 'Ozpetek', 'attitude', 'really', 'loose', 'cannon', 'reference', 'Tomasso', 'Grand', 'Mother', 'knowing', 'understanding', 'heart', 'family', 'sort', 'advice', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'always', 'do', 'what', 'others', 'want', 'life', 'not', 'worth', 'living', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'alcoholic', 'aunt', 'looked', 'sister', 'ageing', 'mistress', 'father', 'towns', 'relentless', 'gossip', 'pace', 'never', 'up', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'Tomasso', 'boyfriend', 'close', 'mates', 'turn', 'up', 'make', 'sure', 'ok.This', 'one', 'most', 'human', 'touching', 'yet', 'funny', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'whilst', 'gay', 'really', 'relationships', 'family', 'prejudices', 'based', 'what', 'neighbours', 'might', 'say', 'Italian', 'excellent', 'sub', 'titles', 'must', 'fan', 'World', 'cinema', 'oh', 'Italian', 'totally', 'stylish', 'too-', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough']",N/A
1379475,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0040JWUY6,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","(Not to be confused with a 1990 American comedy ""Loose Cannons."")Tommaso (Riccardo Scamarcio) is the youngest son of the Cantones, a rich family running pasta-making business. And he has secrets. One is that he wants to be a writer; the other is that he is gay. Tommaso plans to come out to other family members at the dinner party. His plan is thwarted, however, when his brother Antonio (Alessandro Preziosi) announces first that he (Antonio) is gay.Their conservative father Vincenzo (Ennio Fantastichini) is shocked and hospitalized, after throwing out Antonio from the house. Tommaso, bound by duty to his father's business, remains with the family, knowing what he really wants is not here.""Loose Cannons"" (""Mine vaganti"") is a comedy (and Tommaso's friends are hilarious), but the film's events are mostly depicted with a very poignant undertone. Set in a sun-soaked town of Lecce, south-eastern Italy, there is always a touch of sadness about ""loose cannons"" of the clan, including our hero's grandmother, whose past is suggested in the film's dream-like flashbacks (or dreams maybe).Director Ferzan Ozpetek wraps up the whole story with a narrative device that leaves some questions unanswered. Those who prefer a more conventional narrative style find it puzzling and unsatisfying, while others will find it lyrical and thought-provoking. ""Loose Cannons"" provides a honest, bitter-sweet and loving portrait of a family you just cannot hate.",4,Bitter Sweet Portrait of an Italian Family,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,1450,"['Not', 'be', 'confused', '1990', 'American', 'comedy', 'Loose', 'Cannons', 'Tommaso', 'Riccardo', 'Scamarcio', 'youngest', 'son', 'Cantones', 'rich', 'family', 'running', 'pasta-making', 'business', 'secrets', 'One', 'be', 'writer', 'other', 'gay', 'Tommaso', 'come', 'out', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'dinner', 'party', 'plan', 'thwarted', 'however', 'when', 'brother', 'Antonio', 'Alessandro', 'Preziosi', 'first', 'Antonio', 'gay.Their', 'conservative', 'father', 'Vincenzo', 'Ennio', 'Fantastichini', 'shocked', 'hospitalized', 'throwing', 'out', 'Antonio', 'house', 'Tommaso', 'bound', 'duty', 'father', 'business', 'family', 'knowing', 'what', 'really', 'not', 'here', 'Loose', 'Cannons', 'Mine', 'vaganti', 'comedy', 'Tommaso', 'friends', 'are', 'hilarious', 'film', 'events', 'are', 'mostly', 'depicted', 'very', 'poignant', 'undertone', 'Set', 'sun-soaked', 'town', 'Lecce', 'south-eastern', 'Italy', 'always', 'touch', 'sadness', 'loose', 'cannons', 'clan', 'including', 'hero', 'grandmother', 'past', 'suggested', 'film', 'dream-like', 'flashbacks', 'maybe', '.Director', 'Ferzan', 'Ozpetek', 'up', 'whole', 'story', 'narrative', 'device', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'who', 'prefer', 'more', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'style', 'find', 'puzzling', 'unsatisfying', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'lyrical', 'thought-provoking', 'Loose', 'Cannons', 'honest', 'bitter-sweet', 'loving', 'portrait', 'family', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'hate']",N/A
