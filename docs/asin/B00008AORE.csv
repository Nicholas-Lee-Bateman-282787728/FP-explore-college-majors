Delaspozas ""Alicia""","[0, 0]","Before watching the ballet in the theater and knowing it pretty well from before I wanted to have a DVD of this beautiful ballet.I bought this selection because it was one of the best according to the reviewers.I found the main characters: Ketty and Basilio very good in particular the second one played by Mikhall Baryshnikov, one of the best ballet dancers of the XX Century, I enjoyed the parts that they danced very much. The rest of the cast were good but not at the same level as the couple mention before.I found this version much shorter that the ones I&#8217;ve seen before, some fragments were omitted and I noticed this because I had just seen this ballet two days before, another thing that I realized was that some duets danced by the other couple (Toreador and Micaela) were performed by the main characters in this DVD production.The scenery and costumes are the same as the one I saw in the theater two days before I saw this DVD and I found it very beautiful.The quality of the DVD was ok.Even though I noticed some things that I didn't like I am glad I bought this DVD and enjoyed the great performance of Mikhall Baryshnikov of this beautiful ballet with its great music.",4,Mikhall Baryshnikov an outstanding dancer.,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,1190,"['watching', 'ballet', 'theater', 'knowing', 'pretty', 'well', 'wanted', 'have', 'DVD', 'beautiful', 'ballet.I', 'bought', 'selection', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'according', 'reviewers.I', 'found', 'main', 'characters', 'Ketty', 'Basilio', 'very', 'good', 'particular', 'second', 'one', 'played', 'Mikhall', 'Baryshnikov', 'one', 'best', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'XX', 'Century', 'enjoyed', 'parts', 'danced', 'very', 'much', 'rest', 'cast', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'couple', 'mention', 'before.I', 'found', 'version', 'much', 'shorter', 'ones', '8217', 'seen', 'fragments', 'were', 'omitted', 'noticed', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'ballet', 'two', 'days', 'thing', 'realized', 'was', 'duets', 'danced', 'other', 'couple', 'Toreador', 'Micaela', 'were', 'performed', 'main', 'characters', 'DVD', 'production.The', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'are', 'same', 'one', 'saw', 'theater', 'two', 'days', 'saw', 'DVD', 'found', 'very', 'beautiful.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'was', 'ok.Even', 'noticed', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'performance', 'Mikhall', 'Baryshnikov', 'beautiful', 'ballet', 'great', 'music']","Don Quixote / Baryshnikov, Harvey, American Ballet Theatre"

It is much better than the Kirov's. Cynthia Harvery is a most delightful Kitri, Baryshnikov's acting is just as wonderful as his dancing, and they both look beautiful and believable.Baryshnikov's version is a lot better than some of the others. It has  humor and playfulness besides virtuosity.  And yes, I have no idea where Kitri and Basil change their clothes on the way to the second act, but I don't care because that pax de deux is the loveliest and most romantic of all.

It is showey, and full of life and joy. One rather unusual feature is the playing of some of the closing music during the final curtain calls. This adds much life to what is frequently a rather dull time, watching the dancers take their bows. The music adds a final sparkle that brings the whole performance to a close with verve and life. As some of the reviewers have pointed out, it may not be perfect, but it provides an evening of sheer enjoyment, and is a great way to introduce your non-ballet friends to something they may have a better than average chance of enjoying.",5,Leaves You Smiling and Happy,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,698,"['ballet', 'fun', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'never', 'failed', 'be', 'uplifted', 'performance', 'showey', 'full', 'life', 'joy', 'One', 'rather', 'unusual', 'feature', 'playing', 'closing', 'music', 'final', 'curtain', 'much', 'life', 'what', 'frequently', 'rather', 'dull', 'time', 'watching', 'dancers', 'take', 'bows', 'music', 'final', 'sparkle', 'whole', 'performance', 'close', 'verve', 'life', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'evening', 'sheer', 'enjoyment', 'great', 'way', 'introduce', 'non-ballet', 'friends', 'something', 'may', 'have', 'better', 'average', 'chance', 'enjoying']","Don Quixote / Baryshnikov, Harvey, American Ballet Theatre"

I don't even know where to start in my praise, so I'll begin with the smaller parts.  Susan Jaffe and Cheryl Yeager as the dream Mercedes and Amor absolutely shine.  It is no wonder Jaffe has become a superstar.  Johan Renvall is adorable in the small part of the innkeeper's son and has a few incredible leaps.  Frank Smith has become an excellent character dancer as the innkeeper, who is Kitri's father. It was good to see Robert LaFosse in a small role as well, as he had subsequently left American Ballet Theatre for the New York City Ballet.  Unfortunately I do not remember the names of the soloists who dance Kitri's friends, but they are also quite lively.  On a sad note, the late Peter Fonseca, who died too young, sparkles in the corps and in the gypsy camp scene.  He would have been a major international star if he had lived, and I was fortunate to have seen him, Jaffe, Yeager, and Julie Kent with the Maryland Youth Ballet when they were in their teens.  Patrick Bissell, also, is a very attractive Espada.  He, too, died too young and is much missed.In my opinion, Cynthia Harvey was a wonderful Kitri.  Not only was her dancing outstanding, but her personality shone through the role of the kittenish innkeeper's daughter who was determined to win the man she loved, even though he was merely a poor barber, and also to keep the upper hand in their marriage.  Baryshnikov exudes charm and demonstrates that he was, at that time, the world's greatest dancer.However, for me the highlight of the ballet was Victor Barbee as the rejected suitor Gamache.  There is no better actor in all of ballet and, although he wasn't the strongest dancer in the corps, he carries the role with panache and aplomb. He receives the last curtain call, and rightly so.Although Minkus is not the greatest ballet composer, the score is easy to listen to.  The costumes and settings are colorful and enjoyable.  There are some unanswered questions, including where Kitri changed her clothes between act 1, when she runs off with Basil, and act 2, when they arrive at the gypsy camp, as she took nothing with her!  And doesn't she notice that there is no blood on the knife Basil pretends to stab himself with?  But they can be easily overlooked.This is a really enjoyable ballet.  I strongly advise buying it!",5,"Great Dancing, Great Fun",1052697600,"05 12, 2003",2003,2379,"['favorite', 'ballet', 'tape', 'look', 'forward', 'having', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'praise', ""'ll"", 'begin', 'smaller', 'parts', 'Susan', 'Jaffe', 'Cheryl', 'Yeager', 'dream', 'Mercedes', 'Amor', 'absolutely', 'shine', 'wonder', 'Jaffe', 'become', 'superstar', 'Johan', 'Renvall', 'adorable', 'small', 'part', 'innkeeper', 'son', 'few', 'incredible', 'leaps', 'Frank', 'Smith', 'become', 'excellent', 'character', 'dancer', 'innkeeper', 'who', 'Kitri', 'father', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Robert', 'LaFosse', 'small', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'subsequently', 'left', 'American', 'Ballet', 'Theatre', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Ballet', 'Unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'names', 'soloists', 'who', 'dance', 'Kitri', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'lively', 'sad', 'note', 'late', 'Peter', 'Fonseca', 'who', 'died', 'too', 'young', 'sparkles', 'corps', 'gypsy', 'camp', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'international', 'star', 'had', 'lived', 'was', 'fortunate', 'have', 'seen', 'Jaffe', 'Yeager', 'Julie', 'Kent', 'Maryland', 'Youth', 'Ballet', 'when', 'were', 'teens', 'Patrick', 'Bissell', 'also', 'very', 'attractive', 'Espada', 'too', 'died', 'too', 'young', 'much', 'opinion', 'Cynthia', 'Harvey', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Kitri', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'dancing', 'outstanding', 'personality', 'shone', 'role', 'kittenish', 'innkeeper', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'determined', 'win', 'man', 'loved', 'even', 'was', 'merely', 'poor', 'barber', 'also', 'keep', 'upper', 'hand', 'marriage', 'Baryshnikov', 'charm', 'was', 'time', 'world', 'greatest', 'dancer.However', 'highlight', 'ballet', 'was', 'Victor', 'Barbee', 'rejected', 'suitor', 'Gamache', 'better', 'actor', 'ballet', 'was', ""n't"", 'strongest', 'dancer', 'corps', 'role', 'panache', 'aplomb', 'last', 'curtain', 'call', 'rightly', 'so.Although', 'Minkus', 'not', 'greatest', 'ballet', 'composer', 'score', 'easy', 'listen', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'colorful', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'including', 'where', 'Kitri', 'changed', 'clothes', 'act', '1', 'when', 'Basil', 'act', '2', 'when', 'arrive', 'gypsy', 'camp', 'took', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'blood', 'knife', 'Basil', 'stab', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'ballet', 'strongly', 'advise', 'buying']","Don Quixote / Baryshnikov, Harvey, American Ballet Theatre"

737039,A1JEFESGLIS076,B00008AORE,rsoonsa,"[2, 2]","This thoroughly watchable contribution from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), presented at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City during June of 1983, not on the side, but with a good deal of ballyhoo, provides an updated production of an oft-performed standard work from the 18th century Imperial Russian dance repertoire, Don Quixote, a vibrant two act ballet enacted to the music of Ludwig Minkus, and to the established choreography of Marius Petipa and Alexander Gorsky.  The choreography here has been somewhat updated by Mikhail Baryshnikov, but yet becomes an amalgam of the traditional and the modern, with the latter having the edge to please, in front of a rather less than discriminative audience that fails to acknowledge a number of radical shifts made away from the original ballet, such as the scoring of Patrick Flynn, Australian composer.  Baryshnikov, director of the ABT and its temperamental artists, is ever impressive, and more so when one considers his dancing skills, on agreeable display during this fragmentarily recounted piece from the too often ignored Minkus.  Staging of the piece is satiny smooth, with the scenery and costumes designed by Santo Loquasto proving to be worthy in creativity for this too-seldom performed war horse that is moved effectively into contemporaneity by Baryshnikov and his troupe.  Dancing of the ensemble is a good deal more than adequate in developing synchronicity between Minkus and the various choreographic contributions from creative talents old and new.  There is substantially more to this ballet than the familiar final pas de deux chestnut, danced during the elaborate wedding festivities (the film's subtitle is ""Kitri's Wedding"").  Cynthia Harvey, one of the more mannerly members of the company, performs as Kitri, the female lead; unfortunately, her inexperience becomes a primary factor in the piece as it progresses.  Making the most of Baryshnikov's original notations is brilliant new soloist Susan Jaffe as Don Quixote's dream Mercedes.  She later became a ballet mistress for the ABT.  It is, however, Baryshnikov who determines that the Minkus Don Quixote as a ballet retains much of its original vigor.  The Latvian dancer's wondrous tours en l'air are completed with total control and, although a rather thin and uneventful storyline is not precisely stimulating through any rendition, this one of Baryshnikov is spectacularly pacy and if a viewer's interest wanes, the ABT will be shortly on board to restore audience focus from both the leader's dancing and choreography.",5,"Regularly Interesting And Forward Moving Choreography, Noteworthy For Its Style, Acting And Experimentation.",1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,2565,"['watchable', 'contribution', 'American', 'Ballet', 'Theatre', 'ABT', 'presented', 'Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'House', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'June', '1983', 'not', 'side', 'good', 'deal', 'ballyhoo', 'updated', 'production', 'oft-performed', 'standard', 'work', '18th', 'century', 'Imperial', 'Russian', 'dance', 'repertoire', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'vibrant', 'two', 'act', 'ballet', 'enacted', 'music', 'Ludwig', 'Minkus', 'established', 'choreography', 'Marius', 'Petipa', 'Alexander', 'Gorsky', 'choreography', 'here', 'been', 'somewhat', 'updated', 'Mikhail', 'Baryshnikov', 'yet', 'amalgam', 'traditional', 'modern', 'latter', 'having', 'edge', 'please', 'front', 'rather', 'less', 'discriminative', 'audience', 'acknowledge', 'number', 'radical', 'shifts', 'made', 'away', 'original', 'ballet', 'such', 'scoring', 'Patrick', 'Flynn', 'Australian', 'composer', 'Baryshnikov', 'director', 'ABT', 'temperamental', 'artists', 'ever', 'impressive', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'one', 'dancing', 'skills', 'agreeable', 'display', 'fragmentarily', 'recounted', 'piece', 'too', 'often', 'ignored', 'Minkus', 'Staging', 'piece', 'satiny', 'smooth', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'designed', 'Santo', 'Loquasto', 'proving', 'be', 'worthy', 'creativity', 'too-seldom', 'performed', 'war', 'horse', 'moved', 'effectively', 'contemporaneity', 'Baryshnikov', 'troupe', 'Dancing', 'ensemble', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'adequate', 'developing', 'synchronicity', 'Minkus', 'various', 'choreographic', 'contributions', 'creative', 'talents', 'old', 'new', 'substantially', 'more', 'ballet', 'familiar', 'final', 'pas', 'deux', 'chestnut', 'danced', 'elaborate', 'wedding', 'festivities', 'film', 'subtitle', 'Kitri', 'Wedding', 'Cynthia', 'Harvey', 'one', 'more', 'mannerly', 'members', 'company', 'performs', 'Kitri', 'female', 'lead', 'unfortunately', 'inexperience', 'primary', 'factor', 'piece', 'Making', 'most', 'Baryshnikov', 'original', 'notations', 'brilliant', 'new', 'soloist', 'Susan', 'Jaffe', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'dream', 'Mercedes', 'later', 'became', 'ballet', 'mistress', 'ABT', 'however', 'Baryshnikov', 'who', 'Minkus', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'ballet', 'much', 'original', 'vigor', 'Latvian', 'dancer', 'wondrous', 'tours', ""l'air"", 'are', 'completed', 'total', 'control', 'rather', 'thin', 'uneventful', 'storyline', 'not', 'precisely', 'stimulating', 'rendition', 'one', 'Baryshnikov', 'spectacularly', 'pacy', 'viewer', 'interest', 'wanes', 'ABT', 'will', 'be', 'shortly', 'board', 'restore', 'audience', 'focus', 'leader', 'dancing', 'choreography']","Don Quixote / Baryshnikov, Harvey, American Ballet Theatre"
