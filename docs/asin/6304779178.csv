Seagal is a cop who is gunned down and his wife is killed. After many years in a coma, Seagal wakes up and goes to get revenge against the people who killed his wife. This movie is loaded with martial arts and gun fights. There is more martial arts in this movie than in any other Seagal movie. There are multiple times in this movie where Seagal puts away his gun so he can hand out a beating using aikido. One of the best fights is in the liquor store where Seagal tells his four attackers ""Oh, my gun makes this unfair. I'll put it away. How about if I kneel too. Will that make it more fair"". Eventually the bad guy attacks and gets multiple broken bones by Seagal. The end of the movie was very satisfying with more violence including one scene with a pool stick that was so good I was grinning with enjoyment.",5,Seagal's best movie,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,946,"['Hard', 'Kill', 'what', 'made', 'Seagal', 'movie', 'fan', 'Seagal', 'best', 'movie', 'better', 'Siege', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'Seagal', 'cop', 'who', 'gunned', 'down', 'wife', 'killed', 'many', 'years', 'coma', 'Seagal', 'up', 'get', 'revenge', 'people', 'who', 'killed', 'wife', 'movie', 'loaded', 'martial', 'arts', 'gun', 'fights', 'more', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'other', 'Seagal', 'movie', 'are', 'multiple', 'times', 'movie', 'where', 'Seagal', 'away', 'gun', 'can', 'hand', 'out', 'beating', 'using', 'aikido', 'One', 'best', 'fights', 'liquor', 'store', 'where', 'Seagal', 'four', 'attackers', 'Oh', 'gun', 'unfair', ""'ll"", 'put', 'away', 'How', 'kneel', 'too', 'Will', 'make', 'more', 'fair', 'Eventually', 'bad', 'guy', 'attacks', 'multiple', 'broken', 'bones', 'Seagal', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'satisfying', 'more', 'violence', 'including', 'one', 'scene', 'pool', 'stick', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'grinning', 'enjoyment']",N/A

His wife dies, and Storm is in a coma, hidden away under an assumed name by the one trustworthy cop on the force.Seven years later, he wakes up and asks his nurse (Kelly LeBrock) to get him out of the hospital--with a little extra convincing from the bad guys who start shooting up the place to get him, she complies.They hide out while he recuperates and trains and regains his strength, then he goes after the bad guys.Like most Steven Seagal movies, it's a little overdone, a little unbelievable, but it's fun. Seagal is the same character he always plays, and the dry, serious delivery of his lines always works for me. Unfortunately, Kelly LeBrock seemed to be trying to mimic him, and she just sounded wooden. Eh. She was probably eye candy for the male audience anyway.

435533,A319SKSB556033,6304779178,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[2, 5]","Wow, what a difference growing up makes. When I was a kid I thought that Hard to Kill was pretty hardcore. Upon watching it as an adult I realize now that it's really quite tame. With the exception of some occasional swearing there's virtually nothing here to rate the movie higher than PG-13. If the fight scenes hadn't been so poorly choreographed I suppose the R-rating might have been justified.This was the first Seagal movie I ever saw (and Seagal's second movie, coming two years after Above the Law - just enough time for those new hair plugs to grow) and I was entertained as a child, less so now. Seagal plays the ludicrously-named Mason Storm (if there is a subtext to that naming then it's lost on me) a cop who is gunned down by crooked collegues on Oscar night in 1983 for spying on evil politician Vernon Trent (William Sadler, looking like a wimpy Neil Patrick Harris which is quite odd since he was buff and tanned in Die Hard 2 that very same summer). His wife and partner are also killed in the attack. Seven years pass and Storm wakes up in sunny 1990, where he is looked after by glamorous nurse Andy Stewart (Kelly LeBrock, who is gorgeous to look at but has acting skills that make Seagal, her then husband, look good). Storm hides away at a farmstead retreat and repairs his broken body through acupuncture and rigorous training in preparation for tearing the bad guys a new one. It happens eventually, as Storm lurks around the Senator's mansion while various character yell 'DIE' at each other, and it's all massively unspectacular.Forget the fact that logic and common sense are thrown out here, that's a given considering the sub-genre, but my main gripe with Hard to Kill (originally titled Seven Year Storm, which sounds so much cooler) is that it suffers from really bad TV- movie casting when it comes to the supporting characters. Many of the nameless goon bad guys are played by stuntmen too, they don't have any dialogue and only exist for Seagal to slap about (he rarely kills any of these schlubs). Exactly how many crooked cops are there on Trent's pay roll? The fight scenes themselves are shot and cut with little competence and the rest of the action is so pedestrian and dull you'll resist the urge to nod off. The late Bruce Malmouth wasn't a particularly strong director and it really shows. Hard to Kill takes the cold 1970s revenge thriller (a sub-genre usually filled-out with gritty Charles Bronson vehicles) and brightens it up with a colorful, and sometimes tawdry, 1990s aesthetic. If you want a decent early Seagal movie then I suggest Marked for Death instead. It's far more vibrant, action-packed, and just plain crazy than this high-school effort.The one brilliant thing about Hard to Kill is the wonderful score by David Michael Frank. It REALLY carries the film and gives it more emotion and punch that it actually deserves. It's such a shame that only 15 minutes of this score have been released commercially as there's so much good stuff in there. The rest...is strictly workmanlike without ever being engaging. Interesting though how porn actress Akia Athenia Garrido chose the stage name Mason Storm for her career.Warner presents the Blu Ray in 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. Both are a huge step up from the DVD but the bland TV-style photography and poor production values will never look amazing. An old trailer is the only extra. It appears there's no REAL Seagal love on Blu Ray.

During a pointlessly unreal scene, Lebrock lifts the sheet to look at Storm's dormant package, and openly pines for him to awake from the coma.  A guy waking from a coma to a beautiful nurse who wants to have sex with him?  What is this, a porn flick?In a matter of no time, Storm has regained his past superhuman dexterity and strength via some light work outs and self-administered smoking acupuncture needles...because this clearly takes care of SEVEN year's worth of muscle atrophy.  And, sure enough, he and Lebrock start to fall for one another.  From vegetable to fully healthy man forgetful of his dead wife, it's borderline comical how quickly he begins romance anew with his hot, private nurse.During this brief healing period, Storm hears a campaign ad on tv from the corrupt Senator who was involved in his assassination attempt, and this is where the classic Seagal line is uttered, ""I'm gonna take you to the bank Senator. To the blood bank!""From there it's a confrontation with the crooked cops and politicians, where an ample amount of appendages are broken and dislocated, and Mason Storm triumphantly delivers pain before walking off during the credit roll with his new woman, his long lost son, and a plethora of bleeding bad guys in his wake.Classic Seagal, great movie.",4,Come and cut my heart out,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,2478,"['Mason', 'Storm', 'Seagal', 'dangerous', 'LA', 'homicide', 'cop', 'So', 'bad', 'fact', 'early', 'movie', 'exchange', 'cements', 'lethality', 'Storm', 'tauntingly', 'knees', 'grocery', 'store', 'whispering', 'Come', 'cut', 'heart', 'come', 'cut', 'heart', 'out', 'knife-wielding', 'criminal', 'funny', 'criminal', 'clearly', 'never', 'even', 'used', 'steak', 'knife', 'much', 'less', 'attack', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'be', 'black', 'belt', 'aikido', ""'ll"", 'cost', 'one', 'fully', 'functional', 'ankle', 'fibula', 'Mr', 'Unaware', 'Criminal.Anyway', 'Storm', 'investigating', 'police', 'political', 'corruption', 'One', 'night', 'spying', 'corrupt', 'deal', 'where', 'audio', 'video', 'evidence', 'political', 'assassination', 'plan', 'Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'trap', 'shut', 'blabs', 'friend', 'corrupt', 'policemen', 'listen', 'in.Once', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'aware', 'Storm', 'evidence', 'send', 'hit-squad', 'house', 'Completely', 'unaware', 'Storm', 'wife', 'get', 'gunned', 'down', 'bed', 'Luckily', 'Storm', 'young', 'son', 'window', 'Storm', 'not', 'die', 'severely', 'injured', 'just', 'left', 'dead', 'coma.Fast', 'forward', 'seven', 'years', 'Storm', 'up', 'coma', 'where', 'hot', 'nurse', 'Kelly', 'Lebrock', 'attending', 'pointlessly', 'unreal', 'scene', 'Lebrock', 'sheet', 'look', 'Storm', 'dormant', 'package', 'openly', 'pines', 'awake', 'coma', 'guy', 'waking', 'coma', 'beautiful', 'nurse', 'who', 'have', 'sex', 'What', 'porn', 'flick', 'matter', 'time', 'Storm', 'regained', 'past', 'superhuman', 'dexterity', 'strength', 'light', 'work', 'outs', 'self-administered', 'smoking', 'acupuncture', 'needles', 'clearly', 'care', 'SEVEN', 'year', 'worth', 'muscle', 'atrophy', 'sure', 'enough', 'Lebrock', 'start', 'fall', 'one', 'vegetable', 'fully', 'healthy', 'man', 'forgetful', 'dead', 'wife', 'borderline', 'comical', 'how', 'quickly', 'romance', 'anew', 'hot', 'private', 'nurse.During', 'brief', 'healing', 'period', 'Storm', 'campaign', 'ad', 'tv', 'corrupt', 'Senator', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'where', 'classic', 'Seagal', 'line', 'uttered', ""'m"", 'gon', 'take', 'bank', 'Senator', 'blood', 'bank', 'confrontation', 'crooked', 'cops', 'politicians', 'where', 'ample', 'amount', 'appendages', 'are', 'broken', 'dislocated', 'Mason', 'Storm', 'triumphantly', 'pain', 'walking', 'off', 'credit', 'roll', 'new', 'woman', 'long', 'lost', 'son', 'plethora', 'bleeding', 'bad', 'guys', 'wake.Classic', 'Seagal', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

435549,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6304779178,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 3]","I'm conflicted about ""Hard to Kill"" (alternatively known as ""The Seven Year Storm"" - a better title, if you ask me). On one hand, it's a quality vehicle from Steven Seagal's glory days that displays his strengths to near-perfection, but on the other, it's a pretty dumb follow-up to his smarter-than-average debut,Above the Law. Rest assured, it's not a bad action movie by any means, features a couple unconventional touches not seen in other Seagal fare, and certainly belongs on any of Seagal's ""best of"" lists...but for many folks, that's not saying much.The story: Seagal is Mason Storm - a lone wolf policeman who's made a breakthrough regarding a plot to assassinate a US senator. Before he can deliver the evidence, an attack on his home by the crooks leaves his wife dead, his son missing, and Storm himself in a coma. Protected by his friend and colleague Kevin O'Malley (Frederick Coffin,View from the Top), Storm lies unconscious for seven years until awakening to renewed assassination attempts and a thirst for revenge.For the record, being shot and put into a coma would be the most devastating injury ever done to the near-invincible Seagal until some twenty years later inThe Keeper. That doesn't stop him, however, from managing to outrun an assassin while still bedridden, mere minutes after he wakes up. Throw in the beard he grew during his coma and the taking off of his shirt, and you've got a respectable list of things you see in none other of his films. I suppose that's where the film's main appeal lies: he's put into situations you usually don't see him in - like needing to rebilitate himself to the tune of inspiring music - but the fact that he handles all of them in his usual superhuman way puts a bit of a damper on the thought that his character might be but a man this time around. Credit goes to director Bruce Malmuth (Nighthawks) for pushing him, though.The action is what you'd expect from Seagal at this age. The scene in the convenience store is one of the best examples of seeing practical aikido in use, but both it and the scenes that come after aren't quite as ingenius as in ""Above the Law""; in the long run, it's nothing more than Seagal taking out the garbage as usual. However, a later combination of both indoor martial arts and gunplay is one of the finest that Seagal has ever been filmed in: it's a type of scene that hadn't really existed before Seagal and its style still isnt emulated very often, so count your blessings on it. The inclusion of Kelly LeBrock (Weird Science) - Seagal's then-wife -  is a two-edged blade: while she gives little more than an acceptable performance, her interaction with Seagal seems to give the martial artist a confidence that he tends to lack in his usual acting and supplies him with a surprising flair that chooses to express itself during quieter scenes - I mean, when's the last time you've seen Seagal guffaw convincingly? Then again, since she was his real-life spouse, it's inevitable that they begin a relationship in the movie, and this doesn't really feel right considering that to Mason Storm, he just lost his beloved wife weeks ago; I figure they were intentionally trying to avoid drama, but it still feels weird.However, when the bad guys get theirs, you some of the most satisfying scenes that our hero has ever uttered harsh language in: you really don't know how good you can feel for a guy until William Sadler (Roswell - Seasons 1-3) is standing with a gun barrel in his mouth, being told what's going to happen to him in prison. The ability to instill this marvelous feel for vengeance earns director  Malmuth some kudos...but eventually, it feels like just another run-of-the-mill action vehicle for Steven, since the villain isn't particularly memorable and the scope of the film isn't very big. While it's more interesting than most of the films Seagal would involved in later in his career, it really doesn't top an old-fashioned, to-the-point Seagalian bloodbath likeOut for Justice.

It's perhaps the silliest of his early films plot-wise (apart from his directorial debut abomination On Deadly Ground, anyway), it shows him at his most invincible (getting away from multiple bad guys while on a hospital gurney), it's got some of his best lines (""This is for my wife. *beep* you and die!"") and he's at his most over-the-top I-can-do-everything-I'm-Steven-freaking-Seagal throughout.Basically he's an undercover cop whose family gets blown away early on after he discovers a deep mob connection involving a Senator (William Sadler, kind of wasted here). And Seagal (as ""Mason Storm"", one of his best names) is blown away too - except he lives, in a coma, somehow hidden completely away from public knowledge despite being in a regular hospital, for 7 years. Then he comes to in the presence of uber-babe Kelly LeBrock (Mrs. Steven Seagal in real life for several years) and starts trying to escape the baddies, find his old friends who can help him get the dirt on the Senator out in public, etc etc. Along the way he finds time to show off his knowledge of languages, a Seagal trademark (Chinese here), demonstrate lots of martial arts, show his Buddhist teachings (promptly to be ignored when it's time to do some killin'), and generally do plenty of bad acting and ass-kicking.It's not really a ""good"" movie, even by low-budget action movie standards it's hardly great, but if you're a Seagal fan (and what conscious human isn't?) it is one of the must-sees; onlyOut for Justiceis more fun overall I think, and that one actually IS a (pretty) good movie, with Seagal's acting being pretty close to competent, a great villain, and good New York location work.DVD NOTE:  Seagal's movies have been endlessly repackaged in 2fers, 4-packs and the like; obviously there's no reason to spend boucoup bucks on just this one alone.

Both of which are some of his best work. Hard to Kill has the quality of good acting and great Aikido action scenes from Seagal's part, that is not present in his more recent films.The story of Hard to Kill centers on Mason Storm, A cop that is secretly videotaping an individual (who will later become a Senator) telling the mafia that they can rely on his political support. Stating that the can take that to the bank. Storm who thinks he is safe and hasn't been spotted is later found by thugs at his house; they brutally murder his wife and nearly kill Storm as well. He is left in a coma for 7 years, after his wake it's obvious that he is after revenge and will expose the truth he videotaped. The movie manages to show Seagal slowly train and recuperate his strength to fight once more. The movie has more fights and more linear plot than ""Above the Law"". For me this is Seagal's best movie. Main reason because it is still on the realistic level and the character he plays is not as cocky as his future roles. And his acting is much superior to that of his future films. The movie also stars Kelly Le Brock, Seagal's now ex wife.MY PERSONAL RATING: 5 OUT OF 5",5,"""I'm gonna take you to the bank, Senator Trent.

435554,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6304779178,Sid the Elf,"[3, 4]","In 1990, after an excruciating two year wait, the film world was blessed with Steven Segal's second masterpiece, Hard to Kill. The work of cinematic art also stars William Sadler(Heywood from Shawshank Redemption), and Kelly LeBrock. LeBrock and Segal were actually married at the time this film was made. LeBrock was one of the hottest chicks in the 80's, then ballooned up enough to cement her status as B with a Celebrity Fit Club appearance a couple years ago. How did Segal land her? How has he fooled people enough to appear in 20 films? It's like the guy has the whole world hypnotized. Considering how irrelevant they both are now, how funny is it that they were married. And until 1996. I can't even imagine how their relationship was at the end there. Did Segal divorce her because she finally beat him in a hot dog eating contest and he couldn't stand it? I don't get it, but it somehow adds to the b of Hard to Kill doesn't it? You know what else does? The plot.In the movie, Segal plays Mason Storm, no seriously. Storm is a cop(shocker!) who films some mobsters and a politician making some illicit deal. When he gets home, corrupt cops who are in on the deal, shoot up Segal and his family. His wife is dead, Segal is in a coma, and his son jumps out the window but survives. Words cannot do it justice, believe me it was awesome. And a little tough to take. Segal got totally lit up. Sid always thought Segal's ponytail grease would save him somehow in moments like this. And, one of the corrupt cops was the guy who got forked in the hand by Denton Vachs! If you don't know what movie that's from, shame on you.So, Segal is in a coma for SEVEN years. And his smoking hot nurse falls in love with him while he's in the coma. Are they serious? Were they intentionally going for the soap opera parallels? The portion of the movie that featured Segal in the coma and trying to recover from being a vegetable for seven years was the best in the movie. It kept on giving. There was the unforgettably uncomfortable scene when LeBrock lifts up Segal's bedsheet while he's in the coma to get a look at the Segalsage. Her reaction when she saw it: ""PLEASE wake up."" Oh the baby! Then, once Segal was out of his coma, he gave himself acupuncture to regain the muscle function in his legs. Read that again. Obviously, Segal gets his son back. The kid has been living with Segal's old partner. Segal ends up finding out that Senator Vernon ""And you can take that to the bank!"" Trent was the politician talking with the mobsters the night he got shot. So, he goes to Trent's mansion and kills like 15 of Trent's men before holding the Senator at gunpoint. Just then, the cops bust in! And they don't arrest Segal, they arrest the U.S. Senator. Then, Segal is walking away with his son, the old tape Segal shot is playing-and it ends. The credits roll, as they would in any self-respecting B.Hard to Kill will be as ridiculous for you to watch as it was for Sid to try to review. But, if you can watch it while imagining Segal and a buddy sitting in Segal's house trying to write the script it will be just a hilarious, transcendent movie watching experience. The number of times Seagal said things like, ""Yeah, then I have atrophy from the coma. And I...I give myself acupuncture to cure it!"" must have been astounding. And, this movie has historical significance. It is the first time Segal wasn't indestructible in his movies. The only other time this happened was in Executive Decision. During that filming, Segal's tantrum over the fact that he dies in the movie held up shooting for three days. That's the Segal we all know and love, with an ego as big as his giant gut. So, if you feel like laughing at the man who once gave us the quote: ""I am hoping that I can be known as a great writer and actor some day, rather than a sex symbol"" then watch Hard to Kill.

I did find the plot weak, but I never thought that the plot of a Seagal movie was ever the highlight. It does provide action & that's what got him famous. That fame was the reason he was able to get his real wife, Kelly Lebrock, to co star in it. A Seagal fan will still like it & a person unaware of Seagal might join his fan club.
