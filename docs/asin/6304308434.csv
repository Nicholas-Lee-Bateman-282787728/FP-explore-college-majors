Great performances, beautiful, heartbreaking story of a young, blind white girl who develops feelings for an adult, African-American man. At first, they are just friends, they meet in a park, he gives her confidence and she learns to trust a man for the very first time. They eventually fall in love, both know it's wrong and Shelly Winters gives another outstanding performance as the young girl's abusive mom. Sidney Poitier's performance is moving and quite remarkable.

414341,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,6304308434,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[8, 8]","For those who may not ""get"" my title-""Broken Blossoms"" was a 1919 silent classic about a miserable poor white girl from an abusive family who finds friendship and understanding from a Chinese man amidst heavy bigotry against the Chinese.Fast forward to 1965. Elizabeth Hartman is the white girl (whose absue is compounded with her blindness), Shelly Winters is the drunk abusive parent, and Sir Sid (Poitier that is) is the caring nonwhite man who beforends her. This film is actually based on another novel, but the similarities to ""Broken Blossoms"" are interesting.It says a lot about what childhood abuse does to people. The film does a good job in explaining Miss Hartman's blindness, the roots of her insecurity around people, Sir Sid's ambivalence about his friendship with the white girl, etc. A good study in character motivation.The scenes where Shelly Winters, her drunk pappy, an her ignorant partner in prostitution abuse Miss Hartman are heart wrenching without blood and gore and only minor profanity, which may have shocked 1960s audiences. The film also subtly shows the dirty looks that Poitner and Miss Hartman receives as he guides her to through the town.Overall, some morals to this story could be-1) Be kind to children.2) Ignorant and drunken sluts should not have kids3) Friendship and kindness can and does transcend racial and cultural barriers.Probably shocking when it was first released, I would strongly recommend showing this to a high school social studies class and talking about it afterward (sorry, that's the teacher in me).

He used black and white filmstock to preserve the down to earth story. The late Elizabeth Hartman played Selena D'Arcy, a blind girl raised by a vulgar, abusive mother(Shelley Winters). Her only friend is Gordon, a black guy played by Sidney Poitier. The acting in the film is very good. A Patch of Blue was remade in Hong Kong as The Price of Love(1970) starring Chin Ping.

Usually I skip DVD commentary by directors and crew, preferring just to experience the picture without someone yakking off screen, but here it is worth a second viewing to understand the frustrations and finally the rewards Green (and producer Pandro Berman) faced in filming the novel, BE READY WITH BELLS AND DRUMS by Elizabeth Kata.  Though set in the deep South, BE READY was written by an Australian author who had never set foot in the USA!She did a great job, but Green and Berman shelved the depressing vigilance ending of the novel and tried to tailor it for Sidney Poitier's personality.  At the time that screen image was of the perfect man who just happened to be black.  Kindly, radiantly handsome, strong, athletic, musical, a genius, Poitier's image was carved in stone at this point.  His interest in little Selena is painted as the gesture of a great human being for one of the poor unfortunate ones.  In return Elizabeth Hartman gives it all she's got.  I was reminded often of the scenes in Chaplin's City Lights, where the Little Tramp falls in love with a blind girl and hustles like mad to earn enough money to finance an operation that will cure her but which will inevitably destroy her love for him once she sees what he actually looks like!Green also directed three US movies in the following years, none of which have arrived yet on DVD, and barely even on video, but all of them worthy of DVD treatment (hopefully with his memories attached): PRETTY POLLY with Hayley Mills, ONCE IS NOT ENOUGH with Melina Mercouri, David Janssen and Alexis Smith, and the incredible THE MAGUS, which is like BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS taken straight.

414364,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6304308434,Lawyeraau,"[117, 125]","This is a wonderful low-budget, black and white film starring a great cast of actors: Sidney Poitier, Shelley Winters, Wallace Ford, and then newcomer, Elizabeth Hartman. It was filmed in 1965, at the height of the civil rights movement, and was then notable for its budding inter-racial romance. While this aspect may seem rather tame today, at the time the movie was filmed, this was still a somewhat controversial theme in many parts of America.Elizabeth Hartman, in an exquisitely poignant performance for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, plays the part of Selina D'Arcy, an eighteen year old blind girl who lives an  isolated and impoverished, almost Dickensian, existence. She lives with her abusive mother, Rose-Ann (Shelley Winters),  who moonlights as a prostitute, and her drunken, though somewhat well-meaning, grandfather, whom she calls Ole Pa (Wallace Ford). Uneducated, having never gone to school, Selina spends her time stringing beads to earn some money for the family, cleaning up after her mother and grandfather, and being at the receiving end of constant physical abuse and verbal invectives heaped upon her by her mother. Hers is, indeed, a draconian existence.One day, she prevails upon her grandfather to drop her off in the park, where she proceeds to sit under a tree, stringing her beads. There, she meets a kindly, well-educated business man, Gordon Ralphe (Sidney Poitier), who takes an interest in her and her quick appreciation for any kindness done to her.  She responds to Gordon's kindness as if she were a flower turning its face to the sun for continued warmth. He, in turn, is touched by her eager interest in even the most mundane of matters. They continue to meet under that tree as often as possible, and a relationship develops.Under Gordon's tutelage, Selina begins to blossom. Some of her disclosures to him about her life fill him with horror and a determination to do something constructive about it. While he goes about trying to improve her quality of life, their relationship deepens, despite the warnings of Gordon's brother. After all, Selina is white, uneducated, and comes from a trashy, dysfunctional family, while Gordon is black, well-educated, and from a good family.Selina, sure that what she feels is love, is less restrained than Gordon about her feelings, though their budding romance culminates in nothing more than a chaste kiss. When Rose-Ann finds out whom Selina has been meeting, however, matters come to a head, and Gordon comes to the rescue. A modern day knight in shining armor, however, Gordon does the selfless thing in the end.This is a wonderful movie in which the two main protagonists, Gordon and Selina,  judge each other by the content of their respective character and not by the color of their skin. Though controversial at the time, this film may seem a little dated by today's standards. Yet, some of its themes are as fresh today as when it was filmed. The notion of selflessness and putting the needs of another before one's own remains timeless. This is a concept, however, rarely seen in today's films.Although this was Ms. Hartman's debut film, she deservedly received an Academy Award nomination for her sensitive portrayal of Selina. Unfortunately, her career never really took off after this film the way one would have expected after a performance of this caliber. She appeared only in a few notable films, such as, &quot;The Group&quot;, &quot;You're a Big Boy Now&quot;, and &quot;Beguiled&quot;, before descending into virtual obscurity. I was saddened to hear that she committed suicide in the late nineteen eighties at the age of forty-five, a tragic figure in the end, leaving behind this beautiful performance for posterity.",5,"A BITTERSWEET, HEARTBREAKING FILM...",1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,3736,"['wonderful', 'low-budget', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'starring', 'great', 'cast', 'actors', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Wallace', 'Ford', 'then', 'newcomer', 'Elizabeth', 'Hartman', 'was', 'filmed', '1965', 'height', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'was', 'then', 'notable', 'budding', 'inter-racial', 'romance', 'aspect', 'may', 'seem', 'rather', 'tame', 'today', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'still', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'theme', 'many', 'parts', 'America.Elizabeth', 'Hartman', 'exquisitely', 'poignant', 'performance', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'part', 'Selina', ""D'Arcy"", 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'isolated', 'impoverished', 'almost', 'Dickensian', 'existence', 'abusive', 'mother', 'Rose-Ann', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'who', 'prostitute', 'drunken', 'somewhat', 'well-meaning', 'grandfather', 'whom', 'Ole', 'Pa', 'Wallace', 'Ford', 'Uneducated', 'having', 'never', 'gone', 'school', 'Selina', 'time', 'stringing', 'beads', 'earn', 'money', 'family', 'cleaning', 'up', 'mother', 'grandfather', 'being', 'receiving', 'end', 'constant', 'physical', 'abuse', 'verbal', 'invectives', 'heaped', 'mother', 'Hers', 'indeed', 'draconian', 'existence.One', 'day', 'grandfather', 'drop', 'off', 'park', 'where', 'sit', 'tree', 'stringing', 'beads', 'kindly', 'well-educated', 'business', 'man', 'Gordon', 'Ralphe', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'who', 'interest', 'quick', 'appreciation', 'kindness', 'done', 'Gordon', 'kindness', 'were', 'flower', 'turning', 'face', 'sun', 'continued', 'warmth', 'turn', 'touched', 'eager', 'interest', 'even', 'most', 'mundane', 'matters', 'continue', 'meet', 'tree', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'relationship', 'develops.Under', 'Gordon', 'tutelage', 'Selina', 'blossom', 'disclosures', 'life', 'fill', 'horror', 'determination', 'do', 'something', 'constructive', 'about', 'trying', 'improve', 'quality', 'life', 'relationship', 'deepens', 'warnings', 'Gordon', 'brother', 'Selina', 'white', 'uneducated', 'trashy', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Gordon', 'black', 'well-educated', 'good', 'family.Selina', 'sure', 'what', 'love', 'less', 'restrained', 'Gordon', 'feelings', 'budding', 'romance', 'culminates', 'nothing', 'more', 'chaste', 'kiss', 'When', 'Rose-Ann', 'out', 'whom', 'Selina', 'been', 'meeting', 'however', 'matters', 'come', 'head', 'Gordon', 'rescue', 'modern', 'day', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'however', 'Gordon', 'selfless', 'thing', 'end.This', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'Gordon', 'Selina', 'judge', 'other', 'content', 'respective', 'character', 'not', 'color', 'skin', 'controversial', 'time', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'dated', 'today', 'standards', 'themes', 'are', 'fresh', 'today', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'notion', 'selflessness', 'putting', 'needs', 'one', 'own', 'timeless', 'concept', 'however', 'rarely', 'seen', 'today', 'films.Although', 'was', 'Ms.', 'Hartman', 'debut', 'film', 'deservedly', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'Selina', 'Unfortunately', 'career', 'never', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'film', 'way', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'performance', 'caliber', 'appeared', 'only', 'few', 'notable', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Group', 'quot', 'quot', ""'re"", 'Big', 'Boy', 'Now', 'quot', 'quot', 'Beguiled', 'quot', 'descending', 'virtual', 'obscurity', 'was', 'saddened', 'hear', 'committed', 'suicide', 'late', 'nineteen', 'eighties', 'age', 'forty-five', 'tragic', 'figure', 'end', 'leaving', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'posterity']",A Patch of Blue VHS

I'm always in the dark.""Selina D'Arcy (Elizabeth Hartman) is a blind young woman starving for affection and the experiences life brings. She lives in a one room apartment with her Old Pa and verbally and physically abusive mother, Rose-Ann (Shelley Winters).When Selina was five years old her father came home to find Rose-Ann with another man. They began fighting and in the battle Rose-Ann threw a bottle at him. It missed. And hit Selina in the face, blinding her. She's been sheltered all her life both from the outside world and people. She was never taught Braille or self reliance of any kind.Her hunger for experience, of being able to run free through the park, enjoying the grass, trees, birds and open fields overwhelms and depresses her at the same time. One day she encourages Mr. Faber, a man she strings beads into necklaces for, to take her to the park so she can work there. Her mother is against any form of happiness for Selina and even beats her because she went out. This doesn't deter Selina. Especially since she met a special friend named Gordon (Sidney Poitier) there.Gordon and Selina develop a special friendship, meeting under the same tree every day. Gordon is intrigue by her blindness and innocence. He becomes quite protective of her and begins looking into ways to help her leave her current situation and become self sufficient. Selina is warmed by his kindness and willingness to share the world with her.One of the best scenes in the movie is when they are sitting in the park talking and she tells him about her first and only friend she had when she was a child and how she still misses her deeply. Her mother forbade her to have any association with the girl because she was black. This is a pivotal moment because Gordon hasn't yet told Selina that he is black.Shelley Winters delivers an amazing performance as a royal... wicked woman who is determined to keep her daughter a sheltered slave. Winters won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for this role. Elizabeth Hartman was nominated for best actress and actually won a Golden Globe for ""Most Promising Female Newcomer"" for her performance of Selina. She made an amazing effort and I found her to be believable.A Patch of Blue is based on a novel by Australian author Elizabeth Kata. Beyond the racial taboos its deepest theme is about one person doing something good for another with no expectations in return. This 1965 film was made in black and white which adds to the character of the film and the limitations and boundaries of the actors.

414373,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6304308434,Only-A-Child,"[25, 27]","They did an outstanding job of transferring this film to DVD and the 2.35x1 aspect ratio is how you want to see this; especially for the scenes in the apartment.  They must have found an almost perfect print (or the original MGM negative) because the DVD is as crisp and clean as any I have ever seen.  Because B&W; relies so much on contrast and shadows there is often a problem with the old prints, but this well shot feature looks as good as it did in 1965.It took me almost 40 years to finally see ""A Patch of Blue"". It was promoted as the kind of trendy, raise your social consciousness movie that I avoid like the plague. The mid-sixties was full of this kind of moralizing political stuff, as the country finally began to wake up to the embarrassing social inequities and the hypocrisy that hung over everything like a cloud of poison gas. The older half of the baby boomer generation was beginning to question the fear and hate of their parents, and Hollywood was beginning to discover that this had exploitation potential. Most of these things were moronic at the time and have not improved with age.Ironically, what led to my finally viewing this film was watching Catherine Deneuve in another film from 1965; Polanski's ""Repulsion"". Writing a review of that film I lamented the failure of the Academy to nominate Deneuve for Best Actress and Polanski for Best Director. Whatever was thought then about the films and performances actually nominated, in retrospect they pale in comparison to ""Repulsion"". No one even gives a thought anymore to ""Darling"" or ""Ship of Fools"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" is more big that it is good, and Julie Andrews was great in a very weak movie (but decent musical). While ""A Thousand Clowns"" and ""The Collector""-with Samantha Eggar, are good cult films, they are easy to dismiss.But when I got to Elizabeth Hartman's nomination for ""A Patch of Blue"" I realized that I knew very little about her or the performance, having dismissed it as just a reprise of Patty Duke's performance in ""The Miracle Worker"". I became more intrigued when I discovered that Hartman was the actress who blew me away in ""The Beguiled"", so I picked up a copy of the 2.35x1 aspect ratio DVD of ""Patch of Blue"". I was surprised to find that a film with the name of a color in its title had been shot in black and white.After seeing ""Patch of Blue"" I still made my case for ""Repulsion"", but qualified it by saying only Hartman's performance was in the same class as that of Deneuve. Which was quite a concession for me but both performances are truly wonderful.As for ""Patch of Blue"", I found it absolutely amazing-close to perfection. There were so many places where Guy Green could have screwed it up and he neatly avoided them all.The director is presented with a real problem when deciding how to film an actor playing a blind person. Tight shots on the eyes are what makes acting for the camera so special. Unfortunately the unfocused eyes of a blind person cannot convey much emotion, in fact anything but a blank stare betrays the blind illusion. So Guy Green had to get a verbal and body language performance out Hartman that compensated for not being able to use tight shots, and Hartman had to work at not just playing a complex character but also at maintaining the illusion that she was blind. All her scenes are excellent but she has three that are especially memorable.The first is at the kitchen table where she casually discusses being raped with Gordon. Her matter-of-fact narration plays perfectly with Poitier's horrified reaction.The second is after a stranger has helped her back to the apartment from her terrifying failed attempt to find the park by herself. In a few minutes she ranges from despair so deep it verges on madness, to extreme gratitude toward the boy who brings her a message, to giddy joy at the realization that Gordon cares enough about her to send someone to see what has happened to her. Hartman plays all parts of the scene convincingly-I wonder if they shot it all the same day or if Green shot each sequence separately.The third scene (and my personal favorite) is when she is alone in the park and it starts to rain. If someone told me of the challenges posed by this scene, I would not have given it much chance of success, yet Green pulls it off and Hartman is absolutely believable. The is the scene where you first really connect to Selena's fear and isolation, because by this time you know and identify with the character. Absolutely amazing.Here is a little Elizabeth Hartman trivia. After Patty Duke turned down the role because of type-casting concerns and Hayley Mills for financial reasons (what a disaster that would have been), they tested 150 unknowns and choose the 22 year old Hartman. ""I believe I was lacking the things they wanted an actress to lack,"" Hartman told Sidney Skolsky when he made her the subject of one of his ""Tintypes"" profiles. After meeting her Slolsky said: ""She is shy, timid. She sleeps in a normal-size bed in sleeveless nightgowns. She always takes her Raggedy-Ann doll to bed with her."" Prior to Oscar night Hartman, who still lived in Youngstown with her mother, commented ""I'm just waiting for someone to offer me a part in a picture or a play. I'm climbing the walls, as a matter of fact"". MGM did not use her picture in their Oscar ads for her but used a sight gag, a pair of sunglasses in a Price Waterhouse envelope.Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",5,Great DVD-Great Movie,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,5464,"['did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'transferring', 'film', 'DVD', '2.35x1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'how', 'want', 'see',

Those topics were news back then.  I finally watched it last night and I was impressed with the way it handled the delicacy of its' controversy.  To be sure, the script writer gave the plot all the necessary help to be persuasive to the sceptics that came to watch.  The white blind girl came from a family that defined ""dysfunctional"" to an extreme.  The concept of the female lead being blind was not only convenient to the plot, it was great allegory.  Sidney Poitier was exceptional in a role that required strength and compassion.  It would take a cold heart and/or a numb brain to avoid being drawn into the compassion of the film.  Yet this is not some giddy ""Love Story"" but, rather, a serious look at what can happen when love breaks open a vacuum.  The director took a great script and amplified its' meaning in a close-up of two people from different environments who find each other.  Sexuality is subdued.  Indeed, its' periodic presence is in a negative perspective.  We are not looking at a climax but at a beginning.  By focussing just on the beginning, we are spared making judgement on whatever direction or misdirection may have followed.  No doubt that was a brilliant move for its' time but it also resulted in a brilliant movie for anytime.  In truth, the most impressive realization that I got from ""A Patch of Blue"" was how the movie's excellence allowed it to transcend the era it was created in.

Selena was raised by her abusive mother and her alcoholic grandfather.  She staid in the apartment all day, stringing beads.  She begged her grandfather to take her to the park, where she meets Gordon.  Gordon tells Selena about all the accomplishments of the blind and begins to care for the young girl. He introduces Selena to a whole new world and decides, he is going to help her, escape her sad life and the small world, in which, she lives in. Selena immediately begins to care for Gordon and thrives on his attention. This is a very tame and very sweet love story.
