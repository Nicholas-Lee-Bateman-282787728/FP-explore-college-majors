Burchfield,"[0, 0]","Apparently the series producers decided to rearrange things because fourth season Fringe is not set in either of the universes we've tried to understand over the last few years. Walter Bishop keeps seeing someone, finally he & Olivia manage to pull this &#34;person&#34; into their universe- it's Peter, pulled from wherever the Observers dumped him. He's able to use his past experiences in Fringe cases to help this world out. It seems the Observers have a dispute going on between themselves over tampering with the timeline and one, &#34;September&#34;, has been siding with the Bishops since the night he saved Walter and young Peter from drowning.I had trouble caring about this season and the bizarre &#34;Letters of Transit&#34;, near seasons end is even set in 2036, apparently the inspiration for the even more depressing fifth and final season.

(the episode rocks but this is a review for the series)I recommend this show to all of my friends that like good sci-fi and story-telling. I also say that it, like Alias and Lost, must be watched from the beginning to get everything out of the show.The best part about getting a final season is that the writers will get a chance to end it without a cliffhanger, and after several other numerous shows that I could name have been cancelled after only a season or part of a season I feel the joy in getting 100 episodes in the can with all of the multiple story arcs getting resolved. Season 5, even though it is only 13 episodes long, will be that chance.If you liked Alias and Lost (with the exception of that ending) watch this show and decide for yourself.Anna/Olivia has been a pleasure to watch as she plays 3-4 versions of the same charactor over the last 4 seasons.John/Walter has been my favorite mad scientistJosh/Peter has made a sweeping charactor change since the pilotAll of the other wonderful cast mambers have helped make this what has been a very rare occasion over the last several years - great sci-fi television.I wait for September 2012 with anticipation.

The show involves a ton of creatures, video screens, on screen graphics from phones, lasers, and other assorted light sources and they come across great.

It had a small following when new and the writers killed the emotional vesting for the followers in season 4.  So many shows over history have shot themselves in the foot by messing up the sub-plot involving the unrealized love relationship between two characters.  Fringe did a great job of building Olivia and Peter's relationship to be an essential point to the whole season 3 finale by making it such that Peter can only access the machine if done with Olivia.  But then to have him simply disappear at a critical point, when the people from the parallel universe meet and never even resolve the fact that without him the foundation for working out a truce is eliminated and a reason for them building a bridge with it.  Worse is then returning to essentially season 1 having lost the relationship between Peter and Olivia only to go back into the single episode mode with the underlying story becoming meaningless and the desire for their relationship to be fulfilled again not addressed?  I guess the writers were dipping into Walters LSD.  That stripped my emotional vesting in the show as the story around the relationship simply has evaporated.  Peter should have been kept as he was the perfect ambassador between the two universes as he was from one but with emotional ties to the other and naturally served as the glue to hold together a reason to work together.  Instead we get to watch Olivia treat him like dirt and Walter act like a jackass towards a version of his lost son?  Terrible writing decisions.  Even so by the end of the season they had restored much of the emotional portion of the storyline although down a plot path that may have corrected many of these situations, never resolves the anomalies mentioned above and still leaves the first portion of the season largely a waste.  Introducing the bridge and allied sides was a positive that I hope is rectified in season 5.  It was a good portion of the storyline leveraging the possibilities with the other world counterparts.  Just as we are brought to a point of pulling for them alongside our own as we see the real enemies are not each other, they again eliminate what had been a large portion of the series by acting on a guess that closing the bridge would avert the plans to destroy the universes.  Hopefully the 5th season will reconcile it, but with it being the last season and a shortened one at that I suspect there was a reason it was the last and the bad choices in writing will simply diminish some of the enjoyment I got from a show with a lot of positives and even more promise.  I will only know when I've viewed season 5, but every time the show has brought an emotional smile it has quickly been followed by heightened frustration with the writing.  But it is just a show, and science fiction at that, so I don't know that any plot could satisfy all, although I do believe with different choices this show could have been more successful and on the air longer.",4,The beginning of the end through wasted plot opportunities.,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,3073,"['watching', '3', 'seasons', 'was', 'amazed', 'had', 'missed', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'Doing', 'research', 'see', 'why', 'had', 'small', 'following', 'when', 'new', 'writers', 'killed', 'emotional', 'vesting', 'followers', 'season', '4', 'So', 'many', 'shows', 'history', 'have', 'shot', 'foot', 'messing', 'up', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'unrealized', 'love', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'Fringe', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'building', 'Olivia', 'Peter', 'relationship', 'be', 'essential', 'point', 'whole', 'season', '3', 'finale', 'making', 'such', 'Peter', 'can', 'only', 'access', 'machine', 'done', 'Olivia', 'then', 'have', 'simply', 'disappear', 'critical', 'point', 'when', 'people', 'parallel', 'universe', 'meet', 'never', 'even', 'resolve', 'fact', 'foundation', 'working', 'out', 'truce', 'eliminated', 'reason', 'building', 'bridge', 'Worse', 'then', 'returning', 'essentially', 'season', '1', 'having', 'lost', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Olivia', 'only', 'go', 'back', 'single', 'episode', 'mode', 'underlying', 'story', 'becoming', 'meaningless', 'desire', 'relationship', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'again', 'not', 'addressed', 'guess', 'writers', 'were', 'dipping', 'Walters', 'LSD', 'stripped', 'emotional', 'vesting', 'show', 'story', 'relationship', 'simply', 'evaporated', 'Peter', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'was', 'perfect', 'ambassador', 'two', 'universes', 'was', 'one', 'emotional', 'ties', 'other', 'naturally', 'served', 'glue', 'hold', 'together', 'reason', 'work', 'together', 'Instead', 'get', 'watch', 'Olivia', 'treat', 'dirt', 'Walter', 'act', 'jackass', 'version', 'lost', 'son', 'Terrible', 'writing', 'decisions', 'Even', 'so', 'end', 'season', 'had', 'restored', 'much', 'emotional', 'portion', 'storyline', 'down', 'plot', 'path', 'may', 'have', 'corrected', 'many', 'situations', 'never', 'anomalies', 'mentioned', 'still', 'first', 'portion', 'season', 'largely', 'waste', 'Introducing', 'bridge', 'allied', 'sides', 'was', 'positive', 'hope', 'rectified', 'season', '5', 'was', 'good', 'portion', 'storyline', 'leveraging', 'possibilities', 'other', 'world', 'counterparts', 'Just', 'are', 'brought', 'point', 'pulling', 'alongside', 'own', 'see', 'real', 'enemies', 'are', 'not', 'other', 'again', 'eliminate', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'large', 'portion', 'series', 'acting', 'guess', 'closing', 'bridge', 'would', 'avert', 'plans', 'destroy', 'universes', 'Hopefully', '5th', 'season', 'will', 'reconcile', 'being', 'last', 'season', 'shortened', 'one', 'suspect', 'was', 'reason', 'was', 'last', 'bad', 'choices', 'writing', 'will', 'simply', 'diminish', 'enjoyment', 'got', 'show', 'lot', 'positives', 'even', 'more', 'promise', 'will', 'only', 'know', 'when', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'season', '5', 'time', 'show', 'brought', 'emotional', 'smile', 'quickly', 'been', 'followed', 'heightened', 'frustration', 'writing', 'just', 'show', 'science', 'fiction', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'plot', 'could', 'satisfy', 'do', 'believe', 'different', 'choices', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'air', 'longer']",N/A

To enjoy it fully you'll need to be familiar with ""Fringe"", especially the 3rd and 4th season - but that isn't a hard demand: ""Fringe"" is one of the best sci fi TV programs of all time.It's not merely a question of the acting, which is terrific, especially the strong, sultry under currents present in Anna Torv as FBI agent Olivia Dunham who is not merely investigating the fringe events, but is herself a part of the mysteries at the base of the story. John Noble offers comic relief as the auteur of it all, and his acting here is quite a contrast from the last time you saw him as the insane Denethor in ""Lord of the Rings"", who dines on fruits while he demands his last remaining son go to his sure death.I won't spoil your appreciation of this episode by giving away any of the plot points, but I want you to notice that the theme in the series is mirrored in the theme for this episode, and the two come together beautifully as the episode moves to its conclusion.

It is about fringe science (in other words, strange anomalies and sci-fi plot lines). While I liked the actors, I just could not see watching a series of shows that had something bizarre happening each week, to be solved by our intrepid team (yawn).  I didn't see another.However, I happened over to my mother's house and she was watching an early show in season 2... there was Spock (er, excuse me, I should say, Leonard Nemoy) and parallel universes and some of the best plots and acting I had seen on TV in a long time. Fringe became the ONE show I watch each week.  I only allow myself one TV show per week, and if there is nothing good, that becomes zero shows. So, I am one of those people that advertisers don't have much influence over... except now that I am watching Fringe. Season Four continues outstanding acting, plots, fun, and intriguing developments.  True, i am still not a huge fan of the weekly anomalies, but at this point, they all fit into the overall plot lines.Besides, Leonard Nemoy is back!  Thanks for coming back... Leonard Nemoy is a great actor... strange he has not done more (non-Spock) acting in the last many years... but Fringe is 10 times better with Leonard Nemoy than without him!  And that is saying a lot because Fringe has one of the best casts in television.Update: How about the Amazon Instant Video rendition of this?  Yes, Fringe, Season 4 is good on AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO.  I am not a video-phile, so I can't even compare the HD and SD version of this for you.  I watch in Standard Definition on a 720p television, so it seems fine to me. One thing that does bug me about the entire AMAZON experience, however, is NO CLOSED CAPTIONING. As far as I know, there is no way to get English subtitles with Amazon.  At least with Netflix you can use a Wii or game machine or supported Blu-ray device and get closed captioning on most programs. That is really a big failing, in my opinion.How about this episode of Fringe? True, Leonard Nemoy is not in this episode, I was reviewing the season (probably in the wrong place, I see now. Worlds Apart (this episode) sets the stage for the final few episodes (if I am correct at this stage in the season) and it highlights our nemesis (Jones) and his plans. The previous episode (Fringe in the future, 2036?) gives us our first glimpse of where were are headed toward this final season and final shows.  And also is our first glimpse of Leonard Nemoy in a long time. :)",5,"Fringe, Season Four",1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,2577,"['Fringe', 'appeared', 'scene', '4', 'years', 'ago', 'happened', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'rarity', 'thoughts', 'then', 'fringe', 'science', 'other', 'words', 'strange', 'anomalies', 'sci-fi', 'plot', 'lines', 'liked', 'actors', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'watching', 'series', 'shows', 'had', 'something', 'bizarre', 'happening', 'week', 'be', 'solved', 'intrepid', 'team', 'yawn', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'another.However', 'happened', 'mother', 'house', 'was', 'watching', 'early', 'show', 'season', '2', 'was', 'Spock', 'er', 'should', 'say', 'Leonard', 'Nemoy', 'parallel', 'universes', 'best', 'plots', 'acting', 'had', 'seen', 'TV', 'long', 'time', 'Fringe', 'became', 'ONE', 'show', 'watch', 'week', 'only', 'allow', 'one', 'TV', 'show', 'week', 'nothing', 'good', 'zero', 'shows', 'So', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'advertisers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'influence', 'except', 'now', 'am', 'watching', 'Fringe', 'Season', 'Four', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'plots', 'fun', 'intriguing', 'developments', 'True', 'i', 'am', 'still', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'weekly', 'anomalies', 'point', 'fit', 'overall', 'plot', 'lines.Besides', 'Leonard', 'Nemoy', 'back', 'Thanks', 'coming', 'back', 'Leonard', 'Nemoy', 'great', 'actor', 'strange', 'not', 'done', 'more', 'non-Spock', 'acting', 'last', 'many', 'years', 'Fringe', '10', 'times', 'better', 'Leonard', 'Nemoy', 'saying', 'lot', 'Fringe', 'one', 'best', 'casts', 'television.Update', 'How', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'rendition', 'Yes', 'Fringe', 'Season', '4', 'good', 'AMAZON', 'INSTANT', 'VIDEO', 'am', 'not', 'video-phile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'compare', 'HD', 'SD', 'version', 'watch', 'Standard', 'Definition', '720p', 'television', 'fine', 'One', 'thing', 'bug', 'entire', 'AMAZON', 'experience', 'however', 'NO', 'CLOSED', 'CAPTIONING', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'way', 'get', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Amazon', 'least', 'Netflix', 'can', 'use', 'Wii', 'game', 'machine', 'supported', 'Blu-ray', 'device', 'get', 'closed', 'captioning', 'most', 'programs', 'really', 'big', 'failing', 'opinion.How', 'episode', 'Fringe', 'True', 'Leonard', 'Nemoy', 'not', 'episode', 'was', 'reviewing', 'season', 'probably', 'wrong', 'place', 'see', 'now', 'Worlds', 'Apart', 'episode', 'stage', 'final', 'few', 'episodes', 'am', 'correct', 'stage', 'season', 'nemesis', 'Jones', 'plans', 'previous', 'episode', 'Fringe', 'future', '2036', 'first', 'glimpse', 'where', 'were', 'are', 'headed', 'final', 'season', 'final', 'shows', 'also', 'first', 'glimpse', 'Leonard', 'Nemoy', 'long', 'time']",N/A

It did so admirably.  The season deals with the emotional heart of the show, the relationships among the characters, while not stinting on the SF action.  If you skip over the second-to-last episode (which was a preview for what became the fifth and final season) you can see how both the season and the series could have reached a satisfying resolution,albeit with a few loose plot threads left unresolved.  Sadly the video quality on the all the &#34;Fringe&#34; DVDs is not as good as other series I've seen.  (The &#34;CSI&#34; DVD boxes look almost as good as the HD broadcasts if you have a decent up-converting DVD player.)  These discs sometimes go blocky and pixelated, looking almost like video streamed over a low bandwidth network connection.  I ended up replacing all four seasons with the Blu Ray releases (which also include a few extra features not found on the DVDs.) This is the first time I have ever rebought a TV series on BD, but I think &#34;Fringe&#34; is worth it.

I am with both reviewers of TV Guide and USAToday who have tirelessly and shamelessly promoted this show (who both often will try to push a Friday night show opposite it, ie: ""you can watch so and so for some slightly decent entertainment, or you can crawl out of your it's the end of the week and I'm tired and don't want my brain to work too hard malaise and watch Fringe for truly intelligent, well-acted, excellent entertainment"" (sic). I do have to say that putting Grimm up against Fringe is simply Hollywood being rude again as if there is a real choice. I mean, Fringe has been on a lot longer, but has continued to get better and better for the three of us watching it. Grimm is pretty much on a par with Fringe, in creativity and intelligence and lovely quirky characters (seriously, Walter or Monroe? As if we have a choice!), but I think I'm just being bitter again.Admittedly, Fringe had a bit of a stuttering beginning, but I don't believe I've ever seen a sci fi show that didn't (I'll reference Eureka here, which in my opinion had about the worst first year of any sci fi show I've seen - fast forward to its final show that I used up a box of Kleenex as my heart broke watching what became, to me, as close to the perfection of Firefly we have gotten on the entertainment medium called scripted television). Fringe, for those of you who abandoned it for whatever reasons, thus making me soon face another evening wrapped in my favorite blankie, box of Kleenex on hand as I once again, pay homage to the finale of sci fi perfection, will forever be burned into my memory with its wonderful cast of characters - Olivia, Peter, Astrid, and the ultimate arguably best character since Capt. Malcolm Reynolds of Firefly, Walter, presumably *SPOILER ALERT* defeat the Observers as they seek to strip earth of whatever they need and move on to do the same to another hapless planet. And honestly? How did they find the perfect actress to play Etta - who is the spitting image of Olivia with Peter's eyes?While I am grateful that we get with Fringe what we have not gotten from countless other wonderful show (she says, bitterly, still wondering just what The Event was even after two or three years).So I should be grateful to Fox who has been far more generous overall than other networks *cough* NBC *cough* for giving us closure (ie:Prison Break). But really, I couldn't say it better than either the TV Guide guy OR the USAToday guy who have shamelessly and bravely stood up for this truly brilliant show (although without ant compensation) - THIS is not Fox's fault. It is our's.After all Fox is a business and has continued to allow the same 3.5 million viewers (paltry in network world) the privilege of this intelligent, exceptional scripted show far longer than the numbers game should have allowed. We all make choices with what little time we have these days - especially in the only demographic that counts which boggles my mind - those 18 - 49ers who are simply too busy raising families, working to pay the bills or attending whatever event or child-centered Friday night delight to watch an original brand new Steven Spielberg offering let alone a simple TV show. No matter that those of us OVER the age of 49 have made our money and probably have more discretionary income to spend on most advertisers wares - but I'm on my weighted soap box again. I think even Fox was hoping that the final season of Fringe would garner more than the usual 3.5 million voters as I read the comments when they announced them. I think even Fox would have liked another year of this wonderfully odd cast and the many stories left to tell about them.But alas, for whatever reasons, we, the People, have spoken and Fringe will soon be no more. Some day, people who could have made a difference now WILL find and watch Fringe and wish they'd watched it when it mattered. So do I.

The only bad thing is a few weak episodes, but 2 of them are the last ones.  Here&#8217;s a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the pamphlet included with the set.  I will try to keep them as spoiler-free as possible and just keep any spoilers restricted to the analysis.66.  Neither Here Nor There:  In a world where no one remembers Peter Bishop a killer strikes, leaving a trail of translucent corpses.  The best start to a season since the pilot.  A67.  One Night In October:  In the parallel universe, victims freeze to death from the inside out.  In our universe, Walter suffers hallucinations.  A68.  Alone In the World:  Walter bonds with a boy tied to two freakish deaths &#8211; a boy who reminds him of his long-dead son, Peter.  A+69.  Subject 9:  Walter and Olivia&#8217;s encounter with a Cortexiphan subject leads them to someone they don&#8217;t remember&#8230;but who remembers them.  A+70.  Novation:  When the translucent shapeshifters return, Peter astonishes the Fringe team by deciphering the technology that drives them.  A71.  And Those We&#8217;ve Left Behind:  Did Peter&#8217;s reappearance disrupt the space-time continuum?  Boston-area &#8220;time bubbles&#8221; scramble events from 2011 with events from 2007.  A72.  Wallflower:  In 1989, Massive Dynamic turned a desperately ill baby into a human chameleon who can survive only by stealing pigment from the flesh of others.  The monster of the week is interesting, but apart from that this is nothing special.  C73.  Back To Where You&#8217;ve Never Been:  Now a stranger in our universe, Peter asks Olivia and Lincoln to help him return to his original home, the parallel universe.  A+74.  Enemy Of My Enemy:  Peter recognizes the man who controls the shapeshifters.  Walternate convinces both teams to cooperate to stop him.  C+75.  Forced Perspective:  Walter and Peter work together in the lab, Olivia IDs September, and a teenage girl draws pictures of deaths before they occur.  A+76.  Making Angels:  A grumpy Walter works with two Astrids, two Olivias, and a self-appointed mercy killer who dispatches his victims with a bizarre weapon.  A really good spotlight for both Astrids.  Plus, it has Blu Mankuma (the voice of Tigatron from Beast Wars Transformers, Lord Mantle from War Planets/Shadow Raiders and Gigabyte from ReBoot) as Astrid&#8217;s dad.  This is the best live-action production I&#8217;ve seen him in so far.  A+77.  Welcome To Westfield:  At a diner near the scene of a plane crash, Walter orders a piece of rhubarb pie and is served the business end of a chef&#8217;s knife.  I remember looking forward to this episode because I read a review of it in Entertainment Weekly.  It sounded interesting to me, and they gave it an A-.  We were wrong.  It was very interesting, and deserved an A+.78.  A Better Human Being:  While the team investigates a murder visualized by a mental patient, Olivia begins to remember being the other Olivia - the one who loves Peter.  A79.  The End Of All Things:  Hoping to activate Olivia&#8217;s paranormal powers, a villain forces her to watch as he tortures Nina.  A-80.  A Short Story About Love:  As Olivia, Peter and Walter come to terms with September&#8217;s startling revelations, the team investigates a case involving desiccated corpses.  A+81.  Nothing As It Seems:  The spiny monster on Flight 718 is back&#8230;or is it?  A 2009 case from Peter&#8217;s timeline is eerily similar to a new case with connections to the villain.  A very interesting episode, with some extremely scary moments.  A+82.  Everything In Its Right Place:  While tracking a shapeshifter in the parallel universe, Lincoln bonds with the self-confident man he could have been: his double, Captain Lincoln Lee.  Like Making Angels, this is an excellent spotlight for both versions of Lincoln.  A+83.  The Consultant:  When a plane crash in the parallel universe kills three people in ours, Walter crosses the bridge and uncovers a shocking conspiracy.  A84.  Letters Of Transit:  In the year 2036, Observers subjugate humans, Walter is encased in amber, and a nightclub owner named Rick sticks his neck out.  If you are reading this review before you&#8217;ve seen this season, or even the last disc it&#8217;s not too late to tell give you some friendly advice: save this episode for last.  Trust me; it&#8217;s a better ending to the season than the actual season finale, and it leads right into the next season.  A+85.  Worlds Apart:  To stop a plot from collapsing both universes, Walter & Walternate must make a fateful decision.  A+86-87.  Brave New World:  The team confronts its real foe, who is using an unexpected energy source to create a new world.  A disappointing finale.  There are some pretty cool moments, but the heroes are holding idiot balls for most of the story and the revelation of who the real villain is one of the dumbest, most nonsensical twists I have ever seen.  C-Like I said, this season is almost perfect.  But first things first SPOILERS!  The resetting of the timeline didn&#8217;t bother me for the most part.  Alternate Broyles coming back from the dead is fine with me.  My mother complained about how the Fauxlivia replacement arc could have happened in the first place without Peter but since I absolutely hated the arc I don&#8217;t care.  If the writers want to forget about it, that&#8217;s wonderful.  David Robert Jones coming back, however, was a little annoying; but I can just pretend that it&#8217;s an alternate version of him.  But my biggest complaint was in the finale, when William Bell was revealed to be the villain.  I&#8217;m sorry but, reset timeline or not, that makes no sense.  It seemed very disrespectful to do that to such a good character, especially since his initial exit was handled so well.  But like with Jones, I can pretend that in this reset timeline the alternate version of William Bell went into hiding, and came out when his doppelganger died.  But overall this was a very good season, the best apart from the first.  Half of the episodes were A+, only 5 were below A and Letters Of Transit left me really looking forward to the last season.  I&#8217;ve already seen the first 3 episodes of it, and it could be even better than the first.",5,"Sets right what went wrong, while at the same time setting more wrongs.",1404259200,"07 2,

As has become my custom, I rewatch them all on blu ray in a few days. This helps with seeing connections that fade when viewing episodes separated by larger expanses of time. For me, in many ways the impact of the episodes the second time around was even greater, despite having a general memory of what happened the first time. The emotional impact of the characters actions and stories; the subtler nuances and connections of the scripts/stories; the crescendo that is the whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts: this is great television, great story telling, great human drama that is unmatched on television.

Specifically, Walter's kidnapping of his alternate son in an attempt to cure him (which in this incarnation failed and Peter drowned) and an ex-Massive Dynamic researcher who doesn't see his work will first and foremost be used as a covert military weapon. Very well written episode. It was a bit heart-wrenching to hear Walter's recollection of his son's demise and the emotions seeing him as a grown man evoked. Ditto for the scientist when he realizes his wife is dead and all hope of reconciliation of their marriage is gone. Even the little tidbits were thought provoking: Olivia and her sister were raised by Nina Sharp in lieu of state foster care; and apparently she is slipping into the temporal fold again, like when she flipped between universes a season or two back. I did think the twist was fairly televised before it happened but as they quickly established the speed and ferocity of the shapeshifter it ultimately worked. Only oddity I really noticed was that when you know you have two targets send two teams, one to each location. They just seemed to pick one and gamble on it being the right choice.

The acting is superb; especially John Noble's Oscar worthy performance as Walter Bishop and the alternate Walter Bishop. (Yes, I know TV gives out Emmy's) While the background story is kind of science fiction, it is primarily a story about people relationships (Walter & his son Peter, Peter & Olivia, Walter & Astrid) and how they grow and change over time, and how we, as humans, deal with regrets, guilt, love, forgiveness, and redemption. It's a story about ""hope,"" the resilience of love, and the importance of family. Yes, there is a lot of mystery surrounding the superficial action - who is causing all the ""fringe"" events, who is ""the Observer"" and what is his role in all this, and what happens when science steps over the line.

It touches on the greatest sci-fi tropes and puts its own unique spin on them, if not outright improving on them. The show created its own, unique mythology throughout its first three seasons, and many people were dismayed by the beginning of season 4, which in many regards reset continuity. Rest assured though, this was just the shows famed ""slow burn"". Half way through, you find, not only are the events of the past still in motion, the dangers are greater than ever.This would usually be the segment of the review where I would outline the plot of this season, but it is so sophisticated, so involved, that even the most general outline will ruin the surprise. What I can say is that season 4 doesn't skimp on genre defining episodes. ""One night in October"" and ""Welcome to Westfield"" are just a couple of my personal stand outs.The Blu-Ray version boasts the series usual spectacular visuals and dynamic sounds.

I know this review doesn't offer much in the way of ""content"", but knowing how much I enjoyed the twists and turns offered by this amazing season, I simply couldn't live with myself if I deprived potential viewers the same experience,just to pad my review.

In the case of ""Fringe: The Complete Fourth Season"" producers and showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinker decided to do something bold and radical--eliminate one of the characters for part of the fourth season.SPOILERS:Peter (Joshua Jackson)ceased to exist, or rather, died as a child once he had established the link between the two universes and provided stability. As a result the relationships and the events of the past three years are altered for Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Walter Bishop (John Noble--who still hasn't been nominated for an Emmy--REALY Emmy committee? Have you actually WATCHED his performances?)and Astrid (Jasika Nicole). The Fringe team now includes Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) on our side as the team struggles with visions and voices of Peter; it seems that he hasn't entirely been erased by September. Suddenly, Peter returns appearing out of nowhere as a man with no past, no present and no future who knows everybody but nobody knows him.We also have an episode that flashes forward to the future where Baldos (or the Observers as they are really known)control our world after destroying THEIR future world. This flash forward also gives us the opportunity to see how the 13 episode fifth season may play out.END OF SPOILERS:The changes during the fourth season essentially allowed the producers to reboot the show recreating the series again and altering the dynamic of the series. Whether or not you enjoy the changes will depend on how invested you were in the previous three seasons but if you trust the producers/writers and give them a chance, you just might find a fourth season that is challenging and rewarding.As with the previous seasons of ""Fringe"" the transfer is exceptionally good for the Blu-ray (I haven't seen the DVD so can't comment on it). Detail is remarkably sharp and we get improved depth as well as better definition particularly during dark sequences.The lossless audio is presented in 5.1 and sounds marvelous.I am a bit disappointed in the special features. ""Fringe"" has always had interesting commentary tracks unfortunately either due to budget constraints for this set or an oversight on the part of Warner Home Video, this set has no commentary tracks. Since these are often among the best of the special features (at least for me--giving new insight and making an episode ""fresh"" again), I'm a bit disappointed that the producers of this set didn't consider providing this option.On the other hand we get a number of good featurettes on the series. ""The Culture of Fringe"" is a roundtable discussion featuring the producers of the show discussing the science of the show. We also get ""Have You Seen Walter Lately?"" which gathers some of the cast and crews' favorite moments from the show (it's essentially a clip featurette) as well as ""A World Without Peter"" which discusses the void left by Peter and how it impacted all the characters.""The Observers"" gives us some insight into the Baldos that occupy the world of Fringe. Star Joshua Jackson and the producers introduce ""Beyond the Comic Book"" discussing the creation of the ""Beyond The Fringe: Peter and The Machine"". We also get an digital excerpt from this title.Finally we get the season gag reel as well as the option stream the series via Ultraviolet for laptops, etc. The deadline to use this option is September 2014.I enjoyed the fourth season of ""Fringe"" and the risks that the producers took in eliminating a major character for the first third of the season. This altered the dynamics (not in a ""massive"" sense) of the show (for example Walter can't stand Nina in the new timeline and he rarely leaves his lab; Olivia was raised by Nina)but also allowed the possibility of exploring older characters in new ways.If you haven't seen the fourth season yet give it a chance--it is DIFFERENT than what came before but, then again, each season has had its differences and that's what has kept the show (to me at least)vital and interesting.Recommended.",4,"Blu-ray review: Fourth season of ""Fringe"" takes some unexpected turns, nice set",1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,4137,"['shows', 'evolve', 'sometimes', 'evolve', 'ways', 'are', 'popular', 'fans', 'challenging', 'preconceptions', 'what', 'series', 'sometimes', 'not', 'case', 'Fringe', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'producers', 'showrunners', 'J.H', 'Wyman', 'Jeff', 'Pinker', 'decided', 'do', 'something', 'bold', 'radical', 'eliminate', 'one', 'characters', 'part', 'fourth', 'season.SPOILERS', 'Peter', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'ceased', 'exist', 'rather', 'died', 'child', 'once', 'had', 'established', 'link', 'two', 'universes', 'provided', 'stability', 'result', 'relationships', 'events', 'past', 'three', 'years', 'are', 'altered', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'John', 'Noble', 'who', 'still', ""n't"", 'been', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'REALY', 'Emmy', 'committee', 'Have', 'actually', 'WATCHED', 'performances', 'Astrid', 'Jasika', 'Nicole', 'Fringe', 'team', 'now', 'Lincoln', 'Lee', 'Seth', 'Gabel', 'side', 'team', 'visions', 'voices', 'Peter', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'been', 'erased', 'September', 'Suddenly', 'Peter', 'appearing', 'nowhere', 'man', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'who', 'everybody', 'nobody', 'him.We', 'also', 'have', 'episode', 'forward', 'future', 'where', 'Baldos', 'Observers', 'are', 'really', 'known', 'control', 'world', 'destroying', 'THEIR', 'future', 'world', 'flash', 'forward', 'also', 'opportunity', 'see', 'how', '13', 'episode', 'fifth', 'season', 'may', 'play', 'out.END', 'SPOILERS', 'changes', 'fourth', 'season', 'essentially', 'allowed', 'producers', 'reboot', 'show', 'recreating', 'series', 'again', 'altering', 'dynamic', 'series', 'Whether', 'not', 'enjoy', 'changes', 'will', 'depend', 'how', 'invested', 'were', 'previous', 'three', 'seasons', 'trust', 'producers/writers', 'give', 'chance', 'just', 'might', 'find', 'fourth', 'season', 'challenging', 'rewarding.As', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Fringe', 'transfer', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'Blu-ray', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'Detail', 'remarkably', 'sharp', 'get', 'improved', 'depth', 'as', 'well', 'better', 'definition', 'particularly', 'dark', 'sequences.The', 'lossless', 'audio', 'presented', '5.1', 'marvelous.I', 'am', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'special', 'features', 'Fringe', 'always', 'had', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'unfortunately', 'due', 'budget', 'constraints', 'set', 'oversight', 'part', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'set', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'often', 'best', 'special', 'features', 'least', 'giving', 'new', 'insight', 'making', 'episode', 'fresh', 'again', ""'m"", 'bit', 'disappointed', 'producers', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'consider', 'providing', 'other', 'hand', 'get', 'number', 'good', 'featurettes', 'series', 'Culture', 'Fringe', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'featuring', 'producers', 'show', 'discussing', 'science', 'show', 'also', 'get', 'Have', 'Seen', 'Walter', 'Lately', 'cast', 'crews', 'favorite', 'moments', 'show', 'essentially', 'clip', 'featurette', 'as', 'well', 'A', 'World', 'Peter', 'void', 'left', 'Peter', 'how', 'impacted', 'characters', 'Observers', 'insight', 'Baldos', 'world', 'Fringe', 'Star', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'producers', 'introduce', 'Comic', 'Book', 'discussing', 'creation', 'Beyond', 'Fringe', 'Peter', 'Machine', 'also', 'get', 'digital', 'excerpt', 'title.Finally', 'get', 'season', 'gag', 'reel', 'as', 'well', 'option', 'stream', 'series', 'Ultraviolet', 'laptops', 'etc', 'deadline', 'use', 'option', 'September', '2014.I', 'enjoyed', 'fourth', 'season', 'Fringe', 'risks', 'producers', 'took', 'eliminating', 'major', 'character', 'first', 'third', 'season', 'altered', 'dynamics', 'not', 'massive', 'sense', 'show', 'example', 'Walter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Nina', 'new', 'timeline', 'rarely', 'lab', 'Olivia', 'was', 'raised', 'Nina', 'also', 'allowed', 'possibility', 'exploring', 'older', 'characters', 'new', 'ways.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'fourth', 'season', 'yet', 'give', 'chance', 'DIFFERENT', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'then', 'again', 'season', 'had', 'differences', 'what', 'kept', 'show', 'least', 'vital', 'interesting.Recommended']",N/A
1439983,AM1C02CE4WGPC,B0053O8A46,"W. Corse ""OldOneEye""","[0, 0]","We Fringe fans are a bit nuts -- sort of like everyone's favorite Mad Scientist, Walter Bishop, and we're unapologetic about how much we love the show and its characters.  However, Season 4 initially took some getting used to, particularly in the wake of Season 3's outstanding run and its climactic ending, where (possible Spoilers!) Peter saves both universes, only to be -- ERASED?When Season 4 first aired, fan feelings were decidedly mixed, particularly at the beginning when we introduced to the same characters (except Peter) but all living different lives because, in this new timeline, Peter died as a child in BOTH universes, not just ours.  This is soon revealed to be the handiwork of the Observers, those mysterious bald-headed guys in the black bowler hats (and always carrying a satchel -- what's up with that?) who apparently decided on their own that, to reset history to its ""proper version""...well you get the idea.WARNING:  *** SPOILERS AHEAD! ***And we didn't like it, because our beloved friends from Seasons 1 - 3 were so -- different!  Walter is a sad recluse, hanging onto his sanity by a thread (and sometimes losing his grip altogether); Olivia is back to the guarded, closed-up person she was through much of Season 1; Nina Sharp is now Olivia's ""foster Mom""; and our universe's Lincoln Lee (ably played by Seth Gabel) becomes Olivia's new partner and potential love interest!  And William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) is officially dead.  What's not to hate?Turns out our patience was rewarded beyond our wildest dreams.  By the end of Season 4 we had been treated to a variety of excellent stories, and gotten to know our friends all over again, AND saved both universes one more time, although Walter had to kill Olivia to do it. (Sorry, you'll have to purchase the season to get the answers to that one.)  We were also treated to the return of David Robert Jones (from Season 1) as the main villain, and he delivered far beyond anyone's expectations.  And yes, those rumors of William Bell's untimely death?  Sorry, you'll have to find that one out for yourselves as well.Whichever medium you choose to purchase (DVD/Blu-Ray/Online) you'll still want to see every episode, because even the ""weaker"" ones were critical to the characters becoming a family again -- and let's be honest:  the real secret of Fringe's ongoing success has been the family unit centered around Olivia, Peter and Walter, plus Astrid (and all the names Walter still calls her) and Agent Broyles.  But in this season, as opposed to how things went in Season 3, the alt-universe characters play key roles as well, even ""Walternate"" (the Walter Bishop from the other universe) and ""Fauxlivia"" (also played by Anna Torv) who gets to show us she's not all that different from our Olivia after all.  In fact, the best episodes are the ones where both Fringe teams are involved -- still leery of each other at first, but fighting together against the threats posed by Jones. And we can't fail to mention how much Lincoln Lee's expanded roles (in both universes) was a key element to this season's success.(It's hard to pick favorites from this season, but the two episodes (#17 and #18) that I keep watching over and over again feature BOTH Lincoln Lee's in pivotal roles, as the full extent of David Robert Jones' plan is finally revealed and Walter visits the other universe for the first time (in this new timeline) since his initial incursion back in 1985, when his crossing over and back set all these events in motion. Also, episode #17's opening scene includes one of the most memorable ""bad employee getting fired by his angry boss"" scenes you'll ever see on television, and in #18 we get to see how Alt-Broyles makes another sacrifice, equally tragic but unexpected, to save his world.)And yes, this season's Episode #19 (""Letters of Transit"") was in fact the ""pilot"" for the fifth and final season of the series, but that's another review for another time(line).SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???

Now that I have it on Amazon, I'm all caught up to season 4.  It's a great show, I love the characters.  Walter and Astro are great together it's a sweet and caring dynamic.  I love Olive and hated the Fo Olive taking anything from such a kind strong lead...as if Olive hasn't suffered and lost enough.

The story lines were easy to follow with the reasoning behind the theme. Music was awesome. I would greatly recommend to watch this series.  I didn't watch it while it was on TV and now happy I was able to see the episodes without commercial breaks and time between them.  Best ever TV show.

1439990,AP3B615GM191G,B0053O8A46,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[27, 32]","For its first three seasons, ""Fringe"" gave sci-fi junkies the type of show that had gone longing since ""The X-Files"" left the airwaves.  It is cerebral, it is emotional, it is at times funny, and (most of all) it is well thought-out.  Essentially, it is all the things that 99% of television programs these days are not.  While this fourth season of the show is a bit uneven and doesn't quite live up to its previous cannon of work, it is still a quality show that provides some much-needed scripted drama to a TV market over-saturated by reality and competition shows.(Minor spoilers ahead)Like many TV show seasons, this fourth season of ""Fringe"" is broken down into three primary plot-arcs:1. The search for Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), gone missing after the activation of the machine that brought the two universes together.2. The Peter/Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) relationship, further complicated by the sheer number of universe-related possibilities that could be at play.3. The return of David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) and the havoc he wreaks in trying to control the grand scheme of things, necessitating some brilliant thinking/actions from Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) to (hopefully) set things straight.Where this season primarily succeeds is in its ability to (once again) tell stories from a completely different angle than one might think.  For example, one episode jumps years into the future to see what may happen to our protagonists.  Simply put, there is never a lack of creativity on the part of the show creators!  Also, it never ceases to amaze how far the characters in ""Fringe"" come in any given season.  There are some incredibly poignant scenes towards the end of season four that one would not have even dreamed of during the season premiere.The reason for the one-star dockage?  Perhaps because of the threat of cancellation, this season is more up-and-down than its previous three installments.  The action & character development occurred in fits and starts instead of a intelligible pattern.  One week would promise a ""slow burn"", while the next week would bring quick resolution.  Perhaps the writers cannot be blamed for this, what with the ""Sword of Damocles"" hanging over their heads, but either way it just isn't as air-tight as the writing of seasons 1-3.Overall, I am incredibly excited that Fringe is getting a final mini-season to wrap up its many plotlines and character arcs.  With a defined length of time with which to end the show, there is no telling what the writers will give us next!",4,"A Bit Uneven, But Still Better Than 99% Of Television Fare Today",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,2539,"['first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Fringe', 'gave', 'sci-fi', 'junkies', 'type', 'show', 'had', 'gone', 'longing', 'X-Files', 'left', 'airwaves', 'cerebral', 'emotional', 'times', 'funny', 'most', 'well', 'thought-out', 'Essentially', 'things', '99', '%', 'television', 'programs', 'days', 'are', 'not', 'fourth', 'season', 'show', 'bit', 'uneven', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'previous', 'cannon', 'work', 'still', 'quality', 'show', 'much-needed', 'scripted', 'drama', 'TV', 'market', 'over-saturated', 'reality', 'competition', 'shows', 'Minor', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'many', 'TV', 'show', 'seasons', 'fourth', 'season', 'Fringe', 'broken', 'down', 'three', 'primary', 'plot-arcs:1', 'search', 'Peter', 'Bishop', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'gone', 'missing', 'activation', 'machine', 'brought', 'two', 'universes', 'together.2', 'Peter/Olivia', 'Dunham', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'relationship', 'further', 'complicated', 'sheer', 'number', 'universe-related', 'possibilities', 'could', 'be', 'play.3', 'return', 'David', 'Robert', 'Jones', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'havoc', 'trying', 'control', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'necessitating', 'brilliant', 'thinking/actions', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'John', 'Noble', 'hopefully', 'set', 'things', 'straight.Where', 'season', 'primarily', 'ability', 'once', 'again', 'tell', 'stories', 'completely', 'different', 'angle', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'jumps', 'years', 'future', 'see', 'what', 'may', 'happen', 'protagonists', 'Simply', 'put', 'never', 'lack', 'creativity', 'part', 'show', 'creators', 'Also', 'never', 'amaze', 'how', 'far', 'characters', 'Fringe', 'come', 'given', 'season', 'are', 'incredibly', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'end', 'season', 'four', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'dreamed', 'season', 'premiere.The', 'reason', 'one-star', 'dockage', 'Perhaps', 'threat', 'cancellation', 'season', 'more', 'up-and-down', 'previous', 'three', 'installments', 'action', 'character', 'development', 'occurred', 'fits', 'instead', 'intelligible', 'pattern', 'One', 'week', 'would', 'promise', 'slow', 'burn', 'next', 'week', 'would', 'bring', 'quick', 'resolution', 'Perhaps', 'writers', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'blamed', 'what', 'Sword', 'Damocles', 'hanging', 'heads', 'way', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'air-tight', 'writing', 'seasons', '1-3.Overall', 'am', 'incredibly', 'excited', 'Fringe', 'getting', 'final', 'mini-season', 'wrap', 'up', 'many', 'plotlines', 'character', 'arcs', 'defined', 'length', 'time', 'end', 'show', 'telling', 'what', 'writers', 'will', 'give', 'next']",N/A
