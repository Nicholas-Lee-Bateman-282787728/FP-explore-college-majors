A fair amount of the video is full length sequences, not the edited pieces we have become accustomed to seeing. To true historians, it may not be vast amounts of ""new"" footage, but it is pieces rarely seen by the general public.This is what appealed to me-that day, we didn't see everything as it happened. We depended on network news breaks on radio, then TV. I remember as a child, TV coverage ended in our region after the 10 or 11 pm news. This was the first time coverage and telecasts were run all night long. The businesses sent workers home early that day, second & third shifts were canceled. Our world stopped turning for 4 days. The voice of Walter Cronkite bringing news in small segments up to and including the funeral procession.Today, Americans have become much more accustomed to disasterous events and assasinations of public figures, rating only short blips on the constantly running new shows.

That evening I went to the site of Kennedy's death.Having grown up in the Dallas area, I was very familiar with Dealey Plaza on the edge of downtown Dallas.But I was not prepared for what I found.  As the shades of night fell, I recall seeing what appeared to be a blood-red nearly full-moon suddenly hovering over the horizon aligned with and in perfect view of the killing zone.  On both sides of Elm street there were and still are grassy embankments.  On the south-westerly side is the famous Grassy Knoll.  But on this ominous and strange night, both embankments were covered with a solid layer - layers, no doubt - of flowers and hand-scribbled notes.  They wafted and fluttered in the slight breeze that moved across the city of death.  As if in slow-motion, people wandered, meandered and stood among the carpet of color.  There was no sound but for the weeping of the mourners.  Strangers to each other but bound now by the sadness and shock of mortality, history and mystery.I'll never forget it.  It's a moment that has yet to be properly defined.  Was it a coup d'&eacute;tat as many still insist?  I heard disturbing stories and theories by those who were there and from those who were in some way connected to the events and persons of that fateful day in Dallas.There's not enough room on these pages to detail the amazing tales I heard first-hand, but to this day, I tend to think the simplest of all explanations is that Lee Harvey Oswald was not the lone killer - if he even pulled a trigger that sunny afternoon.National Geographic has culled and edited from archival footage of local Dallas area TV and radio stations in a linear recreation of the timeline of the media and police report of the events from Kennedy's arrival in Dallas to the aftermath of his body leaving Parkland hospital.  A friend of mine was working at Parkland hospital emergency room that day and he told me he still sees Jackie Kennedy's freckles floating as if on translucent skin.  ""I've never seen anyone as pale since.  It was ghostly,"" he said.Also on that fateful day, Aldous Huxley (BRAVE NEW WORLD) died.  So did C.S. Lewis.  And in England, the Beatles released their signature version of TILL THERE WAS YOU.

This is not a documentary.  There is no narration.  It is a perfectly paced summary mixing local Dallas news coverage, key eyewitness interviews, and full, extended versions of famous video footage from that weekend.  The video footage will feel both instantly familiar to you and refreshingly new all at the same time.  The interviews and news coverage alone will tell an amazing story of a city and a nation not prepared for this cataclysmic 4-day period.  The emotions are raw.  The shock is sudden.  And in the end you will realize this event, while not necessarily re-shaping America, definitely shaped American media...and American innocence.  The local Dallas news coverage is perfect for capturing the scope of this landmark event.  National media was not on the scene and late-arriving for the most part.  The national media relied heavily on the local media to jump in and tell the story, breaking many rules of journalism along the way, while always maintaining a certain level of integrity whenever possible.  The back and forth struggle between getting the &#34;scoop&#34; and reporting &#34;just the facts&#34; is as compelling enough to watch as the assassination footage.  At one point, as one reporter was announcing the exact address of the JD Tippett shooting moments after it happened, he was interrupted by the chain-smoking anchorman who wondered aloud if it was wise to tell the entire city of the exact address, for fear of too many onlookers joining the chaotic scene.  That same smoking anchorman also secured an in-studio interview with Abraham Zapruder within hours of the shooting...little realizing the importance of this 16mm videographer sitting beside him.  He conducted the most distracted interview you'll ever see...puffing a cigarrette, putting a phone to his ear, and paying little attention to Zapruder's candid, lucid and graphic account of witnessing AND FILMING the murder.This is a wonderfully produced visual record of the entire assassination, from beginning to end.  While it makes no inferences to conspiracies, it certainly points the way to the origins of many of the theories that still exist today.A beautifully haunting musical soundtrack adds to the production, a compelling video you won't be able to take your eyes off.",5,Compelling and dramatic from beginning to end...perfectly produced!,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,2402,"['90', 'minute', 'whirlwind', 'highlight', 'reel', 'incredible', 'as-it-happened', 'coverage', 'fateful', '4', 'days', 'November', '1963', 'not', 'documentary', 'narration', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'summary', 'mixing', 'local', 'Dallas', 'news', 'coverage', 'key', 'eyewitness', 'interviews', 'full', 'extended', 'versions', 'famous', 'video', 'footage', 'weekend', 'video', 'footage', 'will', 'feel', 'instantly', 'familiar', 'refreshingly', 'new', 'same', 'time', 'interviews', 'news', 'coverage', 'alone', 'will', 'tell', 'amazing', 'story', 'city', 'nation', 'not', 'prepared', 'cataclysmic', '4-day', 'period', 'emotions', 'are', 'raw', 'shock', 'sudden', 'end', 'will', 'realize', 'event', 'not', 'necessarily', 're-shaping', 'America', 'definitely', 'shaped', 'American', 'media', 'American', 'innocence', 'local', 'Dallas', 'news', 'coverage', 'perfect', 'capturing', 'scope', 'landmark', 'event', 'National', 'media', 'was', 'not', 'scene', 'late-arriving', 'most', 'part', 'national', 'media', 'relied', 'heavily', 'local', 'media', 'jump', 'tell', 'story', 'breaking', 'many', 'rules', 'journalism', 'way', 'always', 'maintaining', 'certain', 'level', 'integrity', 'whenever', 'possible', 'back', 'forth', 'struggle', 'getting', '34', 'scoop', '34', 'reporting', '34', 'just', 'facts', '34', 'compelling', 'enough', 'watch', 'assassination', 'footage', 'one', 'point', 'one', 'reporter', 'was', 'announcing', 'exact', 'address', 'JD', 'Tippett', 'shooting', 'moments', 'happened', 'was', 'interrupted', 'chain-smoking', 'anchorman', 'who', 'wondered', 'aloud', 'was', 'wise', 'tell', 'entire', 'city', 'exact', 'address', 'fear', 'too', 'many', 'onlookers', 'joining', 'chaotic', 'scene', 'same', 'smoking', 'anchorman', 'also', 'secured', 'in-studio', 'interview', 'Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'hours', 'shooting', 'little', 'realizing', 'importance', '16mm', 'videographer', 'sitting', 'conducted', 'most', 'distracted', 'interview', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'puffing', 'cigarrette', 'putting', 'phone', 'ear', 'paying', 'little', 'attention', 'Zapruder', 'candid', 'lucid', 'graphic', 'account', 'witnessing', 'FILMING', 'murder.This', 'wonderfully', 'produced', 'visual', 'record', 'entire', 'assassination', 'beginning', 'end', 'inferences', 'conspiracies', 'certainly', 'way', 'origins', 'many', 'theories', 'still', 'exist', 'today.A', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'production', 'compelling', 'video', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'take', 'eyes', 'off']",N/A

It is not a platform for conspiracy buffs, who may have seen most of this already. Watching the emotions of the witnesses, journalists and spectators is compelling. The editing is a little choppy but that is because they are trying to capture the events during those days, which means going back and forth to the venues where people were to meet with or see JFK. This is a condensed version of a project PBS did some time ago when they ran the news footage for four days straight.
