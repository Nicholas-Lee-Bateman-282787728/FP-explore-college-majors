I think that the innocence of the US culture and society that is portrayed in this film has disappeared somehow.  The ease of gaining employment will not return in our lifetime.  However, the genuine and welcoming attitudes of just regular people is represented so well here. The diversitiy of American people is also well represented.  People respect each other as individuals.

His friend, the clown of the circus, keeps talking about when they go on their trip to New York, he's going to defect. Vladimir tells him not to talk about it, that he (Vladimir) was obligated to report it to the authorities. ""I could be KGB,"" he says. When they get to New York, it turns out they are assigned to share a hotel room. Vladimir says that's because the KGB has told him to spy on his friend.Their last stop before going to the airport to return to Moscow is Bloomingdale's. The clown has a KGB agent following him closely, and cries that he cannot do it. Suddenly, Vladimir decides to defect. He had been flirting with Lucia (Maria Conchita Alonso), the Italian sales clerk at the perfume counter, so now he hides behind her counter under her skirt! When Lionel Witherspoon (Cleavant Derricks), the security guard responsible for that area, tries to break up the chaos surrounding the KGB agents looking for Vladimir, Vladimir tells him ""I want to defect."" Police are called, they tell the KGB to get lost, a couple of FBI agents show up, and when they find he has no relatives or friends in New York, ask ""Where's he going to sleep?"" Lionel volunteers to take him home with him.No, I'm not going to tell you the whole story. Vladimir gets a lawyer first thing, because immigration lawyer Orlando Ramirez (Alejandro Rey) pushes through the crowd to give Vladimir his business card. So there's no particular issue of his being chased by the KGB, but the FBI tails him. Lionel explains that they are just doing that to be sure he's not a spy, and to protect him from the KGB.Vladimir works at various low-level jobs, rents an apartment, and invites Lucia up to see it. What he really wants to do is get work playing his saxophone. He bought one in a hock shop because his was left on the bus that the other Russians took to the airport. Of course, his neighbors complain when he plays it.The part that choked me up is the scene that never fails to choke me up: new citizens taking the oath of citizenship. Lucia is now an American! Next thing you know, she's fighting with Vladimir. But he gets his authentic initiation to New York soon after: he is mugged.Of course it ends happily. Robin Williams movies usually do.

This may be one of the last really unabashedly pro-American movies to come out of Hollywood, and is a real gem.Robin Williams plays Vladimir, a jazz saxophonist who, on a state-sponsored tour of the &#34;decadent&#34; United States, winds up defecting in Bloomingdale's.  Befriended by a security guard and a perfume saleswoman, Vladimir's journey to join the freedom of the United States, and all the lessons he learns along the way to that freedom, are stirring and heartwarming.&#34;Moscow On The Hudson&#34; is not solely, or even mainly, a comedy.  There are some very funny moments, such as Vlad's hyperventilation when he goes to buy coffee and sees shelves and shelves of different brands, with no waiting lines (as shown while he is in Russia).  Other moments are more poignant and touching.  There is little to laugh at in Moscow, at the time laboring under a repressive Communist regime.  A later scene showing several immigrants taking their oaths of citizenship to the United States is particularly stirring.  The end of the movie is filled with hope and a call to remember the reasons this is such a great country.The casting is filled with excellent performances.  This was Maria Conchita Alonso's first movie, and she is very appealing as the Italian immigrant who has some romantic leanings towards Vlad.  Cleavant Derricks (&#34;Sliders&#34;, &#34;Dreamgirls&#34;) is excellent, too.  Alejandro Rey plays Vlad's Cuban immigration attorney.  Russian comedic actor Savely Kramarov, who left the USSR because it was so repressive, ironically plays one of the KGB handlers Vlad has to evade to defect.Buy this movie.  This is one of Williams' best roles, and the preparations he made for it, including learning Russian and how to play the saxophone, are just one facet of how well suited he was for the part.  As for the rest, Moscow On the Hudson is a celebration of America, and of one man's spirit yearning for freedom.",5,A Great Movie About Becoming American,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,2031,"['one', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'earliest', 'films', 'great', 'even', 'now', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'last', 'really', 'unabashedly', 'pro-American', 'movies', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'real', 'gem.Robin', 'Williams', 'Vladimir', 'jazz', 'saxophonist', 'who', 'state-sponsored', 'tour', '34', 'decadent', '34', 'United', 'States', 'up', 'defecting', 'Bloomingdale', 'Befriended', 'security', 'guard', 'perfume', 'saleswoman', 'Vladimir', 'journey', 'join', 'freedom', 'United', 'States', 'lessons', 'way', 'freedom', 'are', 'stirring', 'heartwarming.', '34', 'Moscow', 'Hudson', '34', 'not', 'solely', 'even', 'mainly', 'comedy', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'such', 'Vlad', 'hyperventilation', 'when', 'buy', 'coffee', 'shelves', 'shelves', 'different', 'brands', 'waiting', 'lines', 'shown', 'Russia', 'Other', 'moments', 'are', 'more', 'poignant', 'touching', 'little', 'laugh', 'Moscow', 'time', 'laboring', 'repressive', 'Communist', 'regime', 'later', 'scene', 'showing', 'several', 'immigrants', 'taking', 'oaths', 'citizenship', 'United', 'States', 'particularly', 'stirring', 'end', 'movie', 'filled', 'hope', 'call', 'remember', 'reasons', 'such', 'great', 'country.The', 'casting', 'filled', 'excellent', 'performances', 'was', 'Maria', 'Conchita', 'Alonso', 'first', 'movie', 'very', 'appealing', 'Italian', 'immigrant', 'who', 'romantic', 'leanings', 'towards', 'Vlad', 'Cleavant', 'Derricks', '34', 'Sliders', '34', '34', 'Dreamgirls', '34', 'excellent', 'too', 'Alejandro', 'Rey', 'Vlad', 'Cuban', 'immigration', 'attorney', 'Russian', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Savely', 'Kramarov', 'who', 'left', 'USSR', 'was', 'so', 'repressive', 'ironically', 'one', 'KGB', 'handlers', 'Vlad', 'evade', 'defect.Buy', 'movie', 'one', 'Williams', 'best', 'roles', 'preparations', 'made', 'including', 'learning', 'Russian', 'how', 'play', 'saxophone', 'are', 'just', 'one', 'facet', 'how', 'well', 'suited', 'was', 'part', 'rest', 'Moscow', 'Hudson', 'celebration', 'America', 'one', 'man', 'spirit', 'yearning', 'freedom']",N/A

Neilsen next joined the AIRPLANE! production team for POLICE SQUAD! and/or THE NAKED GUN...and within a few short years he had gone from sort of famous dramatic actor to household name comedic actor. everyone of a certain age (a dozen or so certain ages, really) remembers this, and they remember it for one very simple reason: it doesn't happen very often.by comparison you frequently hear about actors you associate with comedy taking dramatic roles - about Richard Pryor's apparance on CHICAGO HOPE, for instance, or Jerry Lewis appearing on LAW & ORDER - but you seldom hear much about it, say, a month after the episode in question airs. people within the Industry are always saying that every, EVERY, comedic actor is capable of drama, but that it doesn't always work the other way around. an established comedic actor playing a dramatic role is comparable to an established brain surgeon giving you a tetanus shot.but of course there are no absolutes in this world, are there? if there were my favorite Robin Williams movie certainly wouldn't be the home of his single finest DRAMATIC performance. or, what with the film being a ""dramedy,"" should i call it his finest ""dramamedic"" performance?(well technically, my favorite film that Williams was involved with would be THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUCHAUSEN, but that film is really more synoymous with director Terry Gilliam, to say nothing of the fact that Williams is in about ten minutes of the 2-hour-6-and-1/2-minute film. but that's another issue...)MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON is a poingnant, thought-provoking tale of a Russian defector's attempts to process and integrate himself into the Free World. (back when there was a ""Cold War,"" rememeber.) some will inevitably claim that as a drama it requires him to shift gears completely, but those bozos are full of it. comedy is almost never pure lunacy for pure lunacy's sake. comedies often allow for somber, even depressing, moments. the cast of, say, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN are required to carry, and use, just as much emotional weight, as much ""baggage,"" as the cast of CITIZEN KANE. sitcoms going back to THE HONEYMOONERS and GILLIGAN'S ISLAND have depicted cases of weighty questions to be asked and foolhardy characters having to pay the price for their little goof-ups. and even the driest of dramatic series have been known to shoehorn in occasional ""comic relief."" comedy is a sibling, not an adversary, of drama.so MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON is a serious but peppy film, headlined by an actor who was right in his element from the get-go. at a strictly clinical level, there is no surprise whatsoever in the fact that Williams can pull it off. but there is one surprise, namely the fact he handles it in such a way that you never once find yourself anticipating the usually inevitable scene in which Williams goes gonzo-chamelion on the audience, nor do you particularly miss it when you realize it's not there.a minor victory for the drama snobs, but i guess it is a victory nonetheless.",5,Artful Storytelling From Both Sides Of The

Robin Williams' performance as a Russian jazz musician defecting to America is sensitive and full-bodied, full of the talent and charm that make him so good to watch.  The story is a rollercoaster of moments which reflect the American experience seen through the eyes of someone thrust suddenly in the middle of it all, in the place where it is at its most insane and most wonderful: New York City.There's a line near the end of the film which struck me as particuarly adroit: ""In Moscow, we fight for a crumb of freedom! Here, you s*** on it!""  It really can't be said any better than that, and the movie is filled with moments which illustrate what makes America such a great, rich, and sometimes frightening experience, and what makes freedom such an important, and sometimes dangerous, concept.Freedom is playing ""Take the A-Train"" on your sax, on a fire escape in New York City in the middle of the day for all the world to hear. Freedom is getting mugged on a city street at 2 AM. Freedom is getting into a stupid fight with your girlfriend, and making up with her later.

MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON is not this type of movie.  MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON is noted for having at least a half-dozen recurring characters.  By the time the film is reaching its conclusion, one feels that one knows all of them.The story concerns a small Russian circus, and its musical ensemble, about to embark on goodwill visit and performance in New York City.  The viewer is treated to a generous dose of the usual Russian stereotypes, e.g., long lines of people waiting to buy humble commodities, paranoia regarding the KGB, dancing bears, and ugly chunky women. A vital point in the introductory hour, is Robin Williams' admiration for American jazz.  To untrained ears, his Russian accent sounds authentic.The circus troupe reaches New York City, and during a stopover at Bloomingdale's, Robin Williams breaks away and tries to defect.  He succeeds.  As the film moves onward, it becomes a veritable textbook of relationships: (1) Robin Williams and his host family in America, (2) Robin Williams and department store security guard, (3) Host family's strong mother versus host family's jobless father, (4) Robin Williams and ugly chunky girlfriend in Russia, (5) Robin Williams and beautiful and less chunky Italian girlfriend in New York, (6) Robin Williams and his Russian circus clown buddy, (7) Robin Williams and his grandfather in Russia, (8) Italian girlfriend and her Italian family, and (9) Robin Williams and his Cuban attorney.  To repeat, I am not sure how the scriptwriter and director did it, but this film establishes a little collection of distinctive relationships, each having its own place in the narrative.As mentioned above, the first half of the movie takes place in Russia.  The second half takes place in New York City, apparently in lower Manhattan.  I have toured lower Manhattan several times, that is, the area between the ferry boat terminal and Houston Street, as well as Greenwich Village.  I enjoyed the accurate portrayals of the sidewalk vendors.The movie actually teaches a lesson, namely, the delicate task of severing one's roots, and of the phenomenon of returning to one's roots.
