Johnson,"[1, 1]","MURDER, HE SAYS (1945) - Not Rated, but obviously a `G' for great.  95 minutes""Murder, He Says"" is a hilarious 95 minute comedy about a pollster who finds himself at the mercy of a clan of homicidal hillbillies.  Fred MacMurray, at his comic best, plays ""Pete Marshall"" a pollster for the Trotter Polling Company.  His job is to travel the country asking people about their lifestyles; asking people such daring questions as: Do they have indoor-plumbing, a refrigerator and stove? When another pollster goes missing,  MacMurray is sent to a tiny, backwoods town find him. The local folks send MacMurray ""up the road"" to the Fleagle Homestead, a family of radioactive, glow-in-the-dark hillbillies, lead by Marjorie Main of ""Ma & Pa Kettle"" fame. Ma Fleagle carries a mean looking shotgun and is suspicious of every stranger. Not surprising, as she and her twin boys, Bert and Mert (think Dweedledee and Dweedledum) both played by Peter Whitney, are searching for stolen loot hidden on their property.  This fast-paced farce is in the grand tradition of ""The Old Dark House"" (1932) and Frank Capra's ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944) and will keep you laughing with some the most original, side-splitting gags I've ever seen in a Universal comedy.

Fred MacMurray plays Pete Marshall, hot on the trail of the guy who didn't make it to his next destination.  Pete immediately runs afoul of a murderous family of gun-happy maniacs led by an iron-fisted mother (Marjorie Main) sporting a bullwhip that she uses on everyone and everything.  They're after a stash of money and they don't care who they have to kill to get it.There are mainly just two sets used in the course of this film, a house with secret passages, and an old barn.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I'm mostly here for those nonsense lyrics I couldn't get out of my head when I was a kid and singing: ""Honors flysis income beezis, onches nobsis inob keesis."" Somewhere, Irving Berlin is rolling over in his grave.Fred MacMurray turns in one of his most comic performances in 1945's MURDER, HE SAYS. He plays Pete Marshall, a pollster come to a remote mountain community to locate a vanished colleague. He winds up in a rundown old dark house in the woods, and following cryptic clues to hidden treasure and tangling with that house's residents, a murderous family called the Fleagles.I've been waiting forever for MURDER, HE SAYS to come out on DVD, and now I can stop being sad. MURDER, HE SAYS is a dark, zany, macabre comedy that borrows a bit from Bob Hope'sThe Ghost Breakers, a horror comedy which these characters actually reference. MURDER, HE SAYS also carries just a whiff - a very toned down whiff - of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. And like THE GHOST BREAKERS, this one sends up the Old Dark House genre. Most of the gothic elements are present: the unsettling murder, the creepy house, the secret passageway, false identities, that sinister figure lurking in the shadows and occasionally ambushing the cast. The characters that MacMurray bumps into here are uniformly peculiar and all Fleagles of various persuasion: the crooked, whip-wielding matriarch (Marjorie Main, predictably strident); her shady professorial husband (a sly Porter Hall); an insane girl who keeps singing the same nonsense lyrics (Jean Heather); the brutish twins, one of whom can be immobilized by aggravating that crick in his back (Peter Whitney, playing both twins, thanks to some pretty seamless optical effects). An escaped convict (Helen Walker) surfaces soon enough, but even she's not what she seems.Fred MacMurray is the glue, of course. He centers the film and he's terrific. The film gives you plenty of chances to grin real big. I couldn't stop chuckling when MacMurray pretends that another guy's legs were his own. And I love that sequence with the rotating Lazy Susan table and everyone trying to stay away from the poisoned dinner plate. I won't even go into the glow in the dark shenanigans and the ghost Smedley. Somewhere in all this, MacMurray even finds the time to romance the escaped convict who, admittedly, is pretty easy on the eyes. Tough talking, she tries. Hard-bitten, she's not.",5,"""Honors flysis income beezis, onches nobsis inob keesis.""",1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,2396,"[""'m"", 'mostly', 'here', 'nonsense', 'lyrics', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'singing', 'Honors', 'flysis', 'income', 'beezis', 'nobsis', 'inob', 'keesis', 'Somewhere', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'rolling', 'over', 'grave.Fred', 'MacMurray', 'one', 'most', 'comic', 'performances', '1945', 'MURDER', 'HE', 'SAYS', 'Pete', 'Marshall', 'pollster', 'come', 'remote', 'mountain', 'community', 'locate', 'vanished', 'colleague', 'up', 'rundown', 'old', 'dark', 'house', 'woods', 'following', 'cryptic', 'clues', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'tangling', 'house', 'residents', 'murderous', 'family', 'called', 'Fleagles.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'forever', 'MURDER', 'HE', 'SAYS', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'now', 'can', 'stop', 'being', 'sad', 'MURDER', 'HE', 'SAYS', 'dark', 'zany', 'macabre', 'comedy', 'bit', 'Bob', ""Hope'sThe"", 'Ghost', 'Breakers', 'horror', 'comedy', 'characters', 'actually', 'reference', 'MURDER', 'HE', 'SAYS', 'also', 'just', 'whiff', 'very', 'toned', 'down', 'whiff', 'THE', 'TEXAS', 'CHAINSAW', 'MASSACRE', 'THE', 'GHOST', 'BREAKERS', 'one', 'Old', 'Dark', 'House', 'genre', 'Most', 'gothic', 'elements', 'are', 'present', 'unsettling', 'murder', 'creepy', 'house', 'secret', 'passageway', 'false', 'identities', 'sinister', 'figure', 'lurking', 'shadows', 'occasionally', 'ambushing', 'cast', 'characters', 'MacMurray', 'bumps', 'here', 'are', 'uniformly', 'peculiar', 'Fleagles', 'various', 'persuasion', 'crooked', 'whip-wielding', 'matriarch', 'Marjorie', 'Main', 'predictably', 'strident', 'shady', 'professorial', 'husband', 'sly', 'Porter', 'Hall', 'insane', 'girl', 'who', 'singing', 'same', 'nonsense', 'lyrics', 'Jean', 'Heather', 'brutish', 'twins', 'one', 'whom', 'can', 'be', 'immobilized', 'aggravating', 'crick', 'back', 'Peter', 'Whitney', 'playing', 'twins', 'thanks', 'pretty', 'seamless', 'optical', 'effects', 'escaped', 'convict', 'Helen', 'Walker', 'soon', 'enough', 'even', 'not', 'what', 'seems.Fred', 'MacMurray', 'glue', 'course', 'film', 'terrific', 'film', 'plenty', 'chances', 'grin', 'real', 'big', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'chuckling', 'when', 'MacMurray', 'guy', 'legs', 'were', 'own', 'love', 'sequence', 'rotating', 'Lazy', 'Susan', 'table', 'everyone', 'trying', 'stay', 'away', 'poisoned', 'dinner', 'plate', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'glow', 'dark', 'shenanigans', 'ghost', 'Smedley', 'Somewhere', 'MacMurray', 'even', 'time', 'romance', 'escaped', 'convict', 'who', 'admittedly', 'pretty', 'easy', 'eyes', 'talking', 'Hard-bitten', 'not']",N/A
