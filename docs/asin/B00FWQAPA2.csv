1673541,A2IG7K3PFX1J7V,B00FWQAPA2,Pegster,"[0, 0]",Good movie but based on actual events....Scary that young people actually fall into this and get kidnapped. Good warning movie for teens to see to show them what can happen with online predators. Good acting! Erik Estrada seemed like his Chips days except a bit more grey! Would recommend for Youth groups and parents also.
