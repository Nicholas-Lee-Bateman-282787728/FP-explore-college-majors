The psychological lead of every episode is mysterious and jumpy especially on music which waiting for your attention then breaks silent suddenly out of loud. As I said it made as Sci-Fi what means there are actors and special effects. So it looks very convincing. Unfortunately there is not documentary conformations from story - tellers. I'd expected something like if they telling about scratches made by demons... (Boo!) Well I'd like to see them as photo or video of real evidence not on actors. If there is talk about some hunting place I'd like that some documentary proof would be found in library. There was only one episode ""The calling"" were paranormal investigators found the documented proof in the library of persons who lived in the house or died near by in different centuries. That was interesting... I saw the TV series: ""In the search of"" with Mitch Pileggi. There was man who never believed in paranormal activities, so when it happen to him (he started to paint the portrait of unknown person and write down some notes not anyhow related to his current life) he went to library and made research. And he found the original portrait and notes of some man who lived in 19th century. Well that's the proof! As for ""Haunting"" it's up to you in most of cases to believe it or not.I studied paranormal on my own for many years including witch board, fortune telling, healing energy movements and so on. So in this movie some facts just made me laugh. But I liked how film is made. It kind of give you shiver on your back because of psychological aspect. It's like in hypnosis practice takes all your attention to scary you at the planned point.

1162829,A9UQHYYU3DFXT,B0019BI0W4,"Stephan Bullard ""sgbullard""","[27, 27]","A Haunting is a documentary series that explores allegedly true tales of hauntings, ghosts and the supernatural.  Each show is composed of high quality, atmospheric reenactments following the descriptions of eyewitnesses.  Superimposed on the action is the creepy, measured voice of a narrator who sets the mood and explains the events.  The show is exceptionally effective.  Most episodes have at least some unnerving moments and some are downright scary.Season 4 of A Haunting should continue to appeal to fans. While many of the episodes in Season 4 are interesting, most are not as scary as those from previous seasons.  In fact, some episodes can only be described as odd (e.g., Spellbound) and do not focus on a specific haunting. Some shows are excellent and dedicated viewers will still find plenty to enjoy.  However, I would recommend that new viewers start with earlier seasons.Below is a short description of each episode in Season 4.  The number in parentheses is my ""scariness rating""; scale = 1-5 with 5 being the scariest.  Minor spoilers throughout.Dark Wrath - A demon stalks the halls and terrifies the owners of a rural house near St. Louis (3)The Awakening - Restless ghosts trouble a Midwestern couple (2)The Calling - She sees dead people.  A young mother is traumatized when her ability to see and interact with the deceased becomes impossible to control (2)The Apartment - A young Seattle couple are harassed by paranormal visitors when they move into an apartment where a vicious drug battle once took place (1)Spirits of the Dead - A spooky horse barn is the center of otherworldly events as a dispossessed spirit attempts to control a assemblage of ghosts (2)Where Evil Lurks - A complex haunting takes place in the Ozarks where a daemon that was summoned in a historically haunted house viciously attacks a young family (4)Spellbound - Not a typical A Haunting episode.  It mainly deals with the relationship between a son who becomes a devote Christian (and eventually a minister) and his mother who practices Wicca (1)Echoes of the Past - A family moves into an ancient Vermont home where various spirits, mainly those of two little girls, interact with them (1)Ghost Hunter - The 15 year old son of a ghost hunter becomes possessed while helping her paranormal research team investigate an old cemetery (1)Stalked by Evil - A spirit that lurks in the closet of a Texas home becomes obsessed with the teenage daughter of the new residents (3)Casa de los Muertos - A Latino guitarist and family move into an Arizona house haunted by the spirit of a white supremacist (1)Monster in the Apartment - A young man who dabbles in the occult eventually becomes possessed by a demon and begins to stalk his female roommate (2)Legend Trippers - Legend trippers are people who visit allegedly haunted sites to investigate paranormal activity.  In this episode, several groups of teenagers explore an ancient, creepy Wisconsin cemetery (3)",5,The Series Still Has It,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,2958,"['Haunting', 'documentary', 'series', 'allegedly', 'true', 'tales', 'hauntings', 'ghosts', 'supernatural', 'show', 'composed', 'high', 'quality', 'atmospheric', 'reenactments', 'following', 'descriptions', 'eyewitnesses', 'Superimposed', 'action', 'creepy', 'measured', 'voice', 'narrator', 'who', 'mood', 'events', 'show', 'exceptionally', 'effective', 'Most', 'episodes', 'have', 'least', 'unnerving', 'moments', 'are', 'downright', 'scary.Season', '4', 'A', 'Haunting', 'should', 'continue', 'appeal', 'fans', 'many', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'are', 'interesting', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'scary', 'previous', 'seasons', 'fact', 'episodes', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'odd', 'e.g.', 'Spellbound', 'do', 'not', 'focus', 'specific', 'haunting', 'shows', 'are', 'excellent', 'dedicated', 'viewers', 'will', 'still', 'find', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'However', 'would', 'recommend', 'new', 'viewers', 'start', 'earlier', 'seasons.Below', 'short', 'description', 'episode', 'Season', '4', 'number', 'parentheses', 'scariness', 'rating', 'scale', '=', '1-5', '5', 'being', 'scariest', 'Minor', 'spoilers', 'throughout.Dark', 'Wrath', 'demon', 'halls', 'owners', 'rural', 'house', 'St.', 'Louis', '3', 'Awakening', 'Restless', 'ghosts', 'trouble', 'Midwestern', 'couple', '2', 'Calling', 'dead', 'people', 'young', 'mother', 'traumatized', 'when', 'ability', 'see', 'interact', 'deceased', 'becomes', 'impossible', 'control', '2', 'Apartment', 'young', 'Seattle', 'couple', 'are', 'harassed', 'paranormal', 'visitors', 'when', 'move', 'apartment', 'where', 'vicious', 'drug', 'battle', 'once', 'took', 'place', '1', 'Spirits', 'Dead', 'spooky', 'horse', 'barn', 'center', 'otherworldly', 'events', 'dispossessed', 'spirit', 'attempts', 'control', 'assemblage', 'ghosts', '2', 'Where', 'Evil', 'Lurks', 'complex', 'haunting', 'place', 'Ozarks', 'where', 'daemon', 'was', 'summoned', 'historically', 'haunted', 'house', 'viciously', 'young', 'family', '4', 'Spellbound', 'Not', 'typical', 'A', 'Haunting', 'episode', 'mainly', 'deals', 'relationship', 'son', 'who', 'devote', 'Christian', 'eventually', 'minister', 'mother', 'who', 'practices', 'Wicca', '1', 'Echoes', 'Past', 'family', 'ancient', 'Vermont', 'home', 'where', 'various', 'spirits', 'mainly', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'interact', '1', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', '15', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'becomes', 'possessed', 'helping', 'paranormal', 'research', 'team', 'investigate', 'old', 'cemetery', '1', 'Stalked', 'Evil', 'spirit', 'closet', 'Texas', 'home', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'new', 'residents', '3', 'Casa', 'de', 'los', 'Muertos', 'Latino', 'guitarist', 'family', 'move', 'Arizona', 'house', 'haunted', 'spirit', 'white', 'supremacist', '1', 'Monster', 'Apartment', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'occult', 'eventually', 'possessed', 'demon', 'stalk', 'female', 'roommate', '2', 'Legend', 'Trippers', 'Legend', 'trippers', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'visit', 'allegedly', 'haunted', 'sites', 'investigate', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'episode', 'several', 'groups', 'teenagers', 'explore', 'ancient', 'creepy', 'Wisconsin', 'cemetery', '3']",A Haunting Season 4

Schmitt ""Sue Schmitt""","[2, 2]",I have loved this series from the first movie length tales that were televised A Haunting in Georgia and A Haunting in Connecticut.  Two tales that were very disimilar.  A Haunting in Georgia is the tale of a little girl who saw ghosts and had ghostly companions.  A Haunting in Connecticut is the complete opposite.  We see how a demonic presence in what was a renovated funeral home terrify a family to the brink and institutionalize the oldest son in the family to an sanitarium.  I'm not always pleased with seeing the Warrens included in an investigation because I've not made up my mind about them with all the controversy that is still going on about the house in Amityville.  It seems that this team of ghostbusters always sees the demonic in each case.  The spirits are not always malevolent like Heidi's in Georgia.  I've got the complete series on DVD and they are much beloved and well watched.  I've gotten my Dad interested in them as well.  I highly recommend this season.

The series stands out because of its high production quality, credible reenactments, and also the eyewitness accounts interspersed with interviews with paranormal experts.In Season 4, the episodes continue to engage and creep out viewers [in no particular order]:Ghost Hunter - a paranormal investigator brings her son along to a cemetery and finds that a demon has attached itself to her son.Stalked by Evil - a mother must do all she can to save her daughter from the clutches of a determined ghost.Casa De Los Muertos- a father has to draw on his Puerto Rican roots to save his son from an unearthly entity.Monster in the Apartment - a woman tries to save her cancer-stricken friend from an evil ghost.Legend Trippers - high school friends find themselves at the mercy of unearthly forces when they investigate a local cemetery.Spirits of the Dead- a family at a horse-riding school have to battle an unearthly entity.Where Evil Lurks - a young family faces a demon that threatens their home and lives.Spellbound - a single mom inadvertently summons an evil entity.Echoes of the Past- a young couple find their home haunted by spirits, and must do what they can to save their young daughter from the spirits' clutches.Dark Wrath - a woman faces an evil force bent on destroying her family.The Awakening - a woman struggles to come to terms with her son's Irag mission, and at the same time is haunted by spirits.The Calling - a new bride finds her marriage in peril when her psychic abilities attract a restless spirit.The Apartment - a newly married couple discover the dark history of their apartment.Once again, the DVDs have no special features, but the stories themselves are engaging, so it did not make much of a difference to me.",5,Riveting supernatural-themed dramas based on real accounts,1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,1931,"['mom', 'are', 'avid', 'fans', 'series', 'have', 'purchased', 'complete', 'Seasons', '1-4', '[', 'discounted', 'price', 'Amazon', 'value', 'buy', ']', 'also', 'have', 'individual', 'seasons', 'series', 'out', 'high', 'production', 'quality', 'credible', 'reenactments', 'also', 'eyewitness', 'accounts', 'interspersed', 'interviews', 'paranormal', 'experts.In', 'Season', '4', 'episodes', 'continue', 'engage', 'creep', 'out', 'viewers', '[', 'particular', 'order', ']', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'paranormal', 'investigator', 'son', 'cemetery', 'demon', 'attached', 'son.Stalked', 'Evil', 'mother', 'must', 'do', 'can', 'save', 'daughter', 'clutches', 'determined', 'ghost.Casa', 'De', 'Los', 'Muertos-', 'father', 'draw', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'roots', 'save', 'son', 'unearthly', 'entity.Monster', 'Apartment', 'woman', 'save', 'cancer-stricken', 'friend', 'evil', 'ghost.Legend', 'Trippers', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'find', 'mercy', 'unearthly', 'forces', 'when', 'investigate', 'local', 'cemetery.Spirits', 'Dead-', 'family', 'horse-riding', 'school', 'have', 'battle', 'unearthly', 'entity.Where', 'Evil', 'Lurks', 'young', 'family', 'demon', 'home', 'lives.Spellbound', 'single', 'mom', 'inadvertently', 'evil', 'entity.Echoes', 'Past-', 'young', 'couple', 'find', 'home', 'haunted', 'spirits', 'must', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'save', 'young', 'daughter', 'spirits', 'clutches.Dark', 'Wrath', 'woman', 'evil', 'force', 'bent', 'destroying', 'family.The', 'Awakening', 'woman', 'come', 'terms', 'son', 'Irag', 'mission', 'same', 'time', 'haunted', 'spirits.The', 'Calling', 'new', 'bride', 'marriage', 'peril', 'when', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'attract', 'restless', 'spirit.The', 'Apartment', 'newly', 'married', 'couple', 'dark', 'history', 'apartment.Once', 'again', 'DVDs', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'stories', 'are', 'engaging', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'difference']",A Haunting Season 4
