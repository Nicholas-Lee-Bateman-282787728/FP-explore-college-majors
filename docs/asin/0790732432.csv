100258,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0790732432,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","Every rather formulaic adolescent comedic love story has the potential to fall into the mire of tastelessness and brash humor, but Trojan War rises to the top of the movies in this genre.  Of course, the fact that Jennifer Love Hewitt, the most gorgeous woman on the planet, is in the movie also helps it a great deal.  Were it not for JLH, I would never have bought this movie (I had never even heard of it until I started searching for JLH films).  The fact is, though, that this movie is pretty good on its own merits.  Brad is just a regular guy head over heels over a fairly stereotypical blonde, and he finds himself one item short of making his fantasies come true.  So begins an unbelievably wild series of events in the pursuit of ""protection.""  A quick trip to the convenience store results in the theft of his father's jaguar (and his wallet), a trip to the police station to report the theft, a wild ride with a bus driver who has encountered one too many folks without exact change, a trip to a Spanish bar where a large Spanish woman puts the moves on him, a wild ride with the guys who stole his car, etc.  Much more happens, but you get the idea.  Meanwhile, his best friend Leah (JLH) is agonizing over the fact that Brad is lusting after a shallow blonde and is quite unaware of her own interest in him.  While the ending is fairly predictable, it still manages to be satisfying and uplifting.The acting in this movie is quite good all around.  Of course, the action centers on Brad and his seemingly endless quest; that quest changes dramatically before the night is through, when he finally figures out what he should have been looking for all along.  Hewitt doesn't have enough scenes to satisfy me, but she is terrific.  There are also some interesting cameos in the movie--e.g., I knew the bus driver looked familiar, but it was not until the ending credits that I discovered it was Anthony Michael Hall of 1980s fame.  I would also note the fact that there is one tiny scene after the ending credits roll, so don't hit stop and rewind too quickly if you want to see the entire movie.  I guess the PG-13 rating is explained by the presence of some cursing in the movie (as well as the whole ""protection"" issue), but I think this is a movie parents will have no qualms about letting their younger teenagers watch.",5,Why didn't I have a best friend like Leah?,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,2335,"['rather', 'formulaic', 'adolescent', 'comedic', 'love', 'story', 'potential', 'fall', 'mire', 'tastelessness', 'brash', 'humor', 'Trojan', 'War', 'top', 'movies', 'genre', 'course', 'fact', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'planet', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'Were', 'not', 'JLH', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'bought', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'started', 'searching', 'JLH', 'films', 'fact', 'though', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'own', 'merits', 'Brad', 'just', 'regular', 'guy', 'head', 'heels', 'fairly', 'stereotypical', 'blonde', 'one', 'item', 'short', 'making', 'fantasies', 'come', 'true', 'So', 'unbelievably', 'wild', 'series', 'events', 'pursuit', 'protection', 'quick', 'trip', 'convenience', 'store', 'results', 'theft', 'father', 'jaguar', 'wallet', 'trip', 'police', 'station', 'report', 'theft', 'wild', 'ride', 'bus', 'driver', 'who', 'encountered', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'folks', 'exact', 'change', 'trip', 'Spanish', 'bar', 'where', 'large', 'Spanish', 'woman', 'moves', 'wild', 'ride', 'guys', 'who', 'stole', 'car', 'etc', 'Much', 'more', 'happens', 'get', 'idea', 'Meanwhile', 'best', 'friend', 'Leah', 'JLH', 'agonizing', 'fact', 'Brad', 'lusting', 'shallow', 'blonde', 'quite', 'unaware', 'own', 'interest', 'ending', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'still', 'be', 'satisfying', 'uplifting.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'course', 'action', 'centers', 'Brad', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'quest', 'quest', 'changes', 'dramatically', 'night', 'when', 'finally', 'out', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'along', 'Hewitt', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'scenes', 'satisfy', 'terrific', 'are', 'also', 'interesting', 'cameos', 'movie', 'e.g.', 'knew', 'bus', 'driver', 'looked', 'familiar', 'was', 'not', 'ending', 'credits', 'discovered', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', '1980s', 'fame', 'would', 'also', 'note', 'fact', 'one', 'tiny', 'scene', 'ending', 'credits', 'roll', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'stop', 'rewind', 'too', 'quickly', 'want', 'see', 'entire', 'movie', 'guess', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'explained', 'presence', 'cursing', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'protection', 'issue', 'think', 'movie', 'parents', 'will', 'have', 'qualms', 'letting', 'younger', 'teenagers', 'watch']",Trojan War VHS
100259,A6JRRPNZYLL17,0790732432,David Bocek,"[0, 0]","Trojan War is a good flic.  It is definitely about the games people go thru to find their true love.  In the film, Brad played by Will Freidle is in love with an airheady/shallow girl played by Marley Shelton.  He can not see love right in front of his face with Leah played by J. Love Hewitt.  You have to be about 30 years old to truly understand what this movie is getting at.  It is not a great film but definitely worth seeing and very good.  It is not quite as good as Can't Hardly Wait (1998, also with Hewitt), American Pie (1999), or Take Me Home Tonight (2010) but it is up there with them in the late teen/early 20's genre of romantic comedies from the late 1990's.  The crux of the film in my opinion is that real love is about compatibility and moral values not just sex and the physical end of romance.  The cameo by Lee Majors as the town sherrif is also worth seeing for its comedic qualities.

100262,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0790732432,Only-A-Child,"[1, 4]","The Trojan War (1997) starts with a pretty good premise, even if it was stolen wholesale from 1987's ""Some Kind of Wonderful"". Semi-geek virgin, desperately in love with the schools unattainable beauty who has become disillusioned with popular guy she has been dating. Protagonist's gorgeous (anywhere but in this school) tomboyish best friend is secretly in love with him? Cut to climatic party scene at which all this is sorted out.Unfortunately they stole only the premise and not the actual script (or the cast who would have been too old anyway), so the production falls far short of its predecessor. It also falls far short of its 1998 successor ""Can't Hardly Wait"", also featuring Jennifer Love Hewitt-this time as the unattainable beauty. In fact the writers of that film appear to have taken the script from ""The Trojan War"" and re- written it for an audience with IQ's about 30 points higher. So my advice (unless you are a mega JLH fan) would be to stick with the predecessor and the successor and leave ""The Trojan War"" for its intended audience of wiggers and drones. The soundtrack is much better in those two films as well.""The Trojan War"" was pulled from its scheduled 1997 theatrical release because of poor projected audience numbers and filed away in the hope that Jennifer Love Hewitt's skyrocketing popularity (insert ""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""Party of Five"", and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" here) would change the equation and justify the promotional expense of releasing the movie. Even that was not enough for distributors to take a chance on the film and after a year of deliberation it went direct to video. And even with Hewitt's continued success in ""Ghost Whisperer"", the sales projections for a DVD release of ""The Trojan War"" has not excited anyone in the industry.Then again, what do I know?
