In the end it turned out to be a waste of $30. This anime mixes in romance, yuri (lesbian), and mecha all in one, a horrible combination if you ask me. There  really wasn't much romance in this anime since the main characters don't exactly feel the same way about each other and every episode is the same. Some drama and ends with a mecha fight. Although I admit this anime's story has potential, it was lost underneath poor planning. If your looking for a yuri or mecha anime try elsewehere. The english voice acting was rather terrible as well which contributed to the overall failure of this anime.

Also, the blond eon the cover seems to have a boy AND that other girl on the cover attracted to her. There also might be a little bit of fanservice, but I can't really remember since I haven't continued watching it for a while.It's cheap, I like the music, and I ant to own it so I can feel more motivated to finish watching it. If I buy it and finish it I'll write a better review and either change my rating for the better or worse.

This makes her the object of affection for many guys and girls. Kurusegawa Himeko is shy and sweet. She goes unnoticed much of the time. The 2 girls are very different, but become best friends. After a little time Chikane falls in love with Himeko. An ancient evil awakens and threatens to destroy the world. As the reincarnations of the Moon and Sun priestesses, Chikane and Himeko must fight to save the ones they love. Sadly, an awful destiny is ahead of them and Chikane's unrequited love drives her to madness. The 2 friends must fight for what they want to protect.I've read some bad reviews of this anime. I don't really get why people don't like it. It has great animation, voice acting, music, characters, plot, and a very touching conclusion. My only issue with this one is the length. It's 12 episodes long. Like many more animes this series could have been way better with more depth and character development. It's very difficult to create a massively emotional series in that short of a time. This anime was trying to do that. It succeeded in being great, but could have been much better with more story. This anime doesn't suffer from being short though. It's still very good. I recommend this for any anime fan that's 14 or older.

It's a loving story among three friends and the ending was not what I was expecting. Truly got me by surprise. All in all it's a great series for anyone into mechas, love story, and a little bit of yuri between our two main female leads.

1262863,A24JDJQWQDDH14,B002CWKTQY,Yu Narukami,"[2, 2]","I am an avid yuri fan when it comes down to anime, I was going to purchase this until I read some of the reviews, so I borrowed this anime from a friend of mine. I had read the manga, which was really short, so I wanted to see the anime. SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!Story: Kannazuki no Miko is the story of Himeko and Chikane who are the reincarnations of the Solar and Lunar Miko, respectively. They are two high school girls who attend the prestigious Ototachibana Academy of Mahoroba, Japan. When an ancient evil rises once more, the girls are plunged into destiny as their long-sealed personas awaken to defend the world against the eight Orochi, who are the eight heads of Yamata no Orochi of Japanese folklore. When the Orochi awaken, it is the first day of October (called kannazuki, lit. ""the godless month,"" in the traditional Japanese lunisolar calendar), which just happens to be Himeko and Chikane's birthday. The first Orochi who tries to kill the Miko is Sma gami, the boy in love with Himeko. However, after a blinding flash of light brings him to his senses, he rejects his fate and vows to defend Himeko against the other Orochi. The Miko must awaken Ame no Murakumo in order to combat the threat while Sma repels the Orochis' efforts to kill them.The manga goes into more detail on the relationship between Himeko and Chikane. In the end, Himeko chooses to be incarcerated forever in the shrine with Chikane. At the end, it also shows that a number of years later two twin girls are born and are actually Himeko and Chikane, with the memories and feelings for one another intact.In the anime, Himeko's memory of Chikane is taken away after Chikane sacrifices herself for Himeko and is incarcerated in the shrine. Though Chikane is ultimately reincarnated and their feelings for each other are intact, they are without past memories of one another; their connection is rather sensed through instinct. At the end of the anime, all the Orochi heads go back to their original lives and Himeko is seen walking down a street intersection. As she walks during the post-credits, she comes across Chikane in her new human world body and instantly senses that she is meant to be with this person. The two hug, and narrate how they will always find their way back to each other. The story is good, however, its pacing is off. It could have been even better if it was so sloppy.Animation: The animation leaves alot to be desired. In the beginning of the series I was watching it and I noticed that some of the drawing were a little messy, but later on I started to get used to it, I realised this was 9 years old so I guess the animation is good, but it all really depends on your view.Voices: The english dubbing is really bad, I can understand why some people didn't like that. I would turn on the japanese dub if you want to enjoy it better. Himeko's voice is really irritating.Final word: Not too bad for a yuri, but could be better, I started really getting into it towards the end, I just wish its story would've been more engaging in the beginning. I would probably buy this, but I am not going to go out of my way for it. I'd say buy this if you're a yuri fan. If you're a real yuri fan, I highly recommend Strawberry Panic.",3,"Great anime, but flawed.",1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,3229,"['am', 'avid', 'yuri', 'fan', 'when', 'down', 'anime', 'was', 'going', 'purchase', 'read', 'reviews', 'borrowed', 'anime', 'friend', 'mine', 'had', 'read', 'manga', 'was', 'really', 'short', 'so', 'wanted', 'see', 'anime', 'Story', 'Kannazuki', 'Miko', 'story', 'Himeko', 'Chikane', 'who', 'are', 'reincarnations', 'Solar', 'Lunar', 'Miko', 'respectively', 'are', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'who', 'attend', 'prestigious', 'Ototachibana', 'Academy', 'Mahoroba', 'Japan', 'When', 'ancient', 'evil', 'once', 'more', 'girls', 'are', 'plunged', 'destiny', 'long-sealed', 'personas', 'awaken', 'defend', 'world', 'eight', 'Orochi', 'who', 'are', 'eight', 'heads', 'Yamata', 'Orochi', 'Japanese', 'folklore', 'When', 'Orochi', 'awaken', 'first', 'day', 'October', 'called', 'kannazuki', 'lit', 'godless', 'month', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'lunisolar', 'calendar', 'just', 'be', 'Himeko', 'Chikane', 'birthday', 'first', 'Orochi', 'who', 'kill', 'Miko', 'Sma', 'gami', 'boy', 'love', 'Himeko', 'However', 'blinding', 'flash', 'light', 'brings', 'senses', 'fate', 'vows', 'defend', 'Himeko', 'other', 'Orochi', 'Miko', 'must', 'awaken', 'Ame', 'Murakumo', 'order', 'combat', 'threat', 'Sma', 'Orochis', 'efforts', 'kill', 'them.The', 'manga', 'more', 'detail', 'relationship', 'Himeko', 'Chikane', 'end', 'Himeko', 'be', 'incarcerated', 'forever', 'shrine', 'Chikane', 'end', 'also', 'number', 'years', 'later', 'two', 'twin', 'girls', 'are', 'born', 'are', 'actually', 'Himeko', 'Chikane', 'memories', 'feelings', 'one', 'intact.In', 'anime', 'Himeko', 'memory', 'Chikane', 'taken', 'away', 'Chikane', 'sacrifices', 'Himeko', 'incarcerated', 'shrine', 'Chikane', 'ultimately', 'reincarnated', 'feelings', 'other', 'are', 'intact', 'are', 'past', 'memories', 'one', 'connection', 'rather', 'sensed', 'instinct', 'end', 'anime', 'Orochi', 'heads', 'go', 'back', 'original', 'lives', 'Himeko', 'seen', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'intersection', 'post-credits', 'Chikane', 'new', 'human', 'world', 'body', 'instantly', 'meant', 'be', 'person', 'two', 'hug', 'narrate', 'how', 'will', 'always', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'other', 'story', 'good', 'however', 'pacing', 'off', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'so', 'sloppy.Animation', 'animation', 'alot', 'be', 'desired', 'beginning', 'series', 'was', 'watching', 'noticed', 'drawing', 'were', 'little', 'messy', 'later', 'started', 'get', 'used', 'realised', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'guess', 'animation', 'good', 'really', 'view.Voices', 'english', 'dubbing', 'really', 'bad', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'turn', 'japanese', 'dub', 'want', 'enjoy', 'better', 'Himeko', 'voice', 'really', 'irritating.Final', 'word', 'Not', 'too', 'bad', 'yuri', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'started', 'really', 'getting', 'end', 'just', 'wish', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'engaging', 'beginning', 'would', 'probably', 'buy', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'way', ""'d"", 'say', 'buy', ""'re"", 'yuri', 'fan', ""'re"", 'real', 'yuri', 'fan', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Strawberry', 'Panic']",N/A
