However, the movie focused alot on the kids relationships which got tired considering the girl was rather torn between the guys and also alot on the kids alcohol usage which again got rather old when you are wanting the story line to progress.  The killer was somewhat lackluster but he did have an odd humor about him.  It was ok but not something I would sit through again with slow pacing and lackluster acting.",3,it was different...,1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,529,"['put', 'different', 'view', 'things', 'considering', 'teenagers', 'tried', 'blackmailing', 'killer', 'killing', 'exfriend', 'However', 'movie', 'focused', 'alot', 'kids', 'relationships', 'got', 'tired', 'considering', 'girl', 'was', 'rather', 'torn', 'guys', 'also', 'alot', 'kids', 'alcohol', 'usage', 'again', 'got', 'rather', 'old', 'when', 'are', 'wanting', 'story', 'line', 'progress', 'killer', 'was', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'did', 'have', 'odd', 'humor', 'was', 'ok', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'sit', 'again', 'slow', 'pacing', 'lackluster', 'acting']",Acolytes
1252116,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,B0026VKXRQ,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[3, 3]","Acolytes has a pretty simple but intriguing premise--three teens attempt a game they're not prepared to play.  The game is blackmail, and the target is a cold-blooded killer.  They quickly learn they're in way over their heads.Mark is a teenager who spots a mysterious man burying something out in the woods.  Probably just a dead pet, but he and his friends contemplate other possibilities--a stash of money, perhaps?  They decide to go dig it up, and are flabbergasted by whay they uncover--a dead woman.  When they try to report the crime over the phone, the police demand some identification.  Scared, they hang up the phone instead and consider other options.Amazing what teenagers will do when they're bored.  First, they decide to track the killer down.  Not trying to be heroes or anything, they do this simply out of some sick curiousity or morbid fascination.  Since they know the vehicle he drives and the vicinity of where he lives, it doesn't take long.Eventually they make another foolish decision--blackmail this psychopath.  The tables soon get turned and the results could be deadly.Really the main thing these kids needed were some adult guidance.  Parents who care about them and could supervise them somewhat.  No presence whatsoever of an adult who is ready to listen, and this proves to be costly.This film does a tremendous job at developing characters and building tension.  Surprisingly stellar performances from the young cast as well.  There are elements of teen sexuality mixed in with the action and danger.  Plus evidence of an abused childhood begin to manifest.  This has a very well written screenplay.But unfortunately this film culminates in a gruesome, horrific finale that seemed a little uneven and forced.  That is the only major drawback to this film, otherwise I thought it was damn near perfect.",4,"Brilliant thriller, but sub-par with horror elements",1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,1837,"['Acolytes', 'pretty', 'simple', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'three', 'teens', 'attempt', 'game', ""'re"", 'not', 'prepared', 'play', 'game', 'blackmail', 'target', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'quickly', 'learn', ""'re"", 'way', 'heads.Mark', 'teenager', 'who', 'mysterious', 'man', 'burying', 'something', 'out', 'woods', 'Probably', 'just', 'dead', 'pet', 'friends', 'contemplate', 'other', 'possibilities', 'stash', 'money', 'perhaps', 'decide', 'go', 'dig', 'up', 'are', 'flabbergasted', 'whay', 'uncover', 'dead', 'woman', 'When', 'try', 'report', 'crime', 'phone', 'police', 'demand', 'identification', 'Scared', 'hang', 'up', 'phone', 'instead', 'consider', 'other', 'options.Amazing', 'what', 'teenagers', 'will', 'do', 'when', ""'re"", 'bored', 'First', 'decide', 'track', 'killer', 'down', 'Not', 'trying', 'be', 'heroes', 'anything', 'do', 'simply', 'sick', 'curiousity', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'know', 'vehicle', 'vicinity', 'where', ""n't"", 'take', 'long.Eventually', 'make', 'foolish', 'decision', 'blackmail', 'psychopath', 'tables', 'soon', 'get', 'turned', 'results', 'could', 'be', 'deadly.Really', 'main', 'thing', 'kids', 'needed', 'were', 'adult', 'guidance', 'Parents', 'who', 'care', 'could', 'supervise', 'somewhat', 'presence', 'whatsoever', 'adult', 'who', 'ready', 'listen', 'be', 'costly.This', 'film', 'tremendous', 'job', 'developing', 'characters', 'building', 'tension', 'Surprisingly', 'stellar', 'performances', 'young', 'cast', 'well', 'are', 'elements', 'teen', 'sexuality', 'mixed', 'action', 'danger', 'evidence', 'abused', 'childhood', 'begin', 'manifest', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'screenplay.But', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'gruesome', 'horrific', 'finale', 'seemed', 'little', 'uneven', 'forced', 'only', 'major', 'drawback', 'film', 'otherwise', 'thought', 'was', 'damn', 'near', 'perfect']",Acolytes

I'm very confident that there are no slip ups.  there are a number of unexpected twists that made sense because of human nature's willingness to leave important details.  so when a character doesn't tell others everything it's to keep up his, or her, own public perception.  nobody likes to have their past embarassements waved around.basic story:  some kids received terrible torment from a guy when they were young.now days a girl goes missing.  we don't know exactly what happened but we see some clips and are left to assume.one of the three main characters. mark, sees a guy bury something.  he, also, sees the guys vehicle.the others come back, with mark, to see what was buried.  they find a body.they deduce that the killer must be local.while looking for the grave diggers vehicle they see their old tormenter.the old tormentor comes after them.mark doesn't like that one of his two friends called up the grave digger and set into motion a simple idea.""hey, grave digger...  if you don't kill our tormentor we'll turn you into the cops.""from here we see that simple plans often don't go right and can develop terrible side effects.  also, there seems to be a little research that was used to come up with: what creates the sick-o's that we see as sociopaths...  or damages to the young which will later create a psychopath.i felt that there was high quality in the acting, filming, direction, and script.  much of the scenery was beautiful, filmed in queensland Australia.as i mentioned earlier there were many unexpected points that created twists.  these were not gimmicks but based on human nature.  after viewing the film/dvd again I'm sure i'll find the film seamless with no lose ends.after re-watching the film/dvd.  there were no losse ends.  this is a rare gem and proof that a film can be great with little to no money for the budget.",5,i was more impressed with this then the other reviewers.,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,2331,"['i', 'gave', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'maybe', 'was', 'four', 'half.i', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'movie', 'i', 'could', 'see', 'much', 'not', 'having', 'taken', 'place', 'okay', 'ease', 'making', 'movie', 'things', 'were', 'simplified', '[', 'ease', 'illegal', 'entry', 'domicile', 'i', 'point', 'felt', 'promoted', 'accepted', 'child', 'molestation', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'i', 'will', 'need', 'watch', 'once', 'more', 'make', 'sure', 'lose', 'ends', 'were', 'tied', 'up', ""'m"", 'very', 'confident', 'are', 'slip', 'ups', 'are', 'number', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'made', 'sense', 'human', 'nature', 'willingness', 'leave', 'important', 'details', 'so', 'when', 'character', ""n't"", 'tell', 'others', 'everything', 'keep', 'up', 'own', 'public', 'perception', 'nobody', 'have', 'past', 'embarassements', 'waved', 'around.basic', 'story', 'kids', 'received', 'terrible', 'torment', 'guy', 'when', 'were', 'young.now', 'days', 'girl', 'missing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'see', 'clips', 'are', 'left', 'assume.one', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'mark', 'guy', 'bury', 'something', 'also', 'guys', 'vehicle.the', 'others', 'come', 'back', 'mark', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'buried', 'find', 'body.they', 'deduce', 'killer', 'must', 'be', 'local.while', 'looking', 'grave', 'diggers', 'vehicle', 'see', 'old', 'tormenter.the', 'old', 'tormentor', 'them.mark', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'two', 'friends', 'called', 'up', 'grave', 'digger', 'set', 'motion', 'simple', 'idea', 'hey', 'grave', 'digger', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'tormentor', ""'ll"", 'turn', 'cops', 'here', 'see', 'simple', 'plans', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'right', 'can', 'develop', 'terrible', 'side', 'effects', 'also', 'be', 'little', 'research', 'was', 'used', 'come', 'up', 'what', 'sick-o', 'see', 'sociopaths', 'damages', 'young', 'will', 'later', 'create', 'psychopath.i', 'felt', 'was', 'high', 'quality', 'acting', 'filming', 'direction', 'script', 'much', 'scenery', 'was', 'beautiful', 'filmed', 'queensland', 'Australia.as', 'i', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'were', 'many', 'unexpected', 'points', 'created', 'twists', 'were', 'not', 'gimmicks', 'based', 'human', 'nature', 'viewing', 'film/dvd', 'again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'i', ""'ll"", 'find', 'film', 'seamless', 'lose', 'ends.after', 're-watching', 'film/dvd', 'were', 'losse', 'rare', 'gem', 'proof', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'little', 'money', 'budget']",Acolytes
1252120,A12FLZREV32JOP,B0026VKXRQ,Noelle Eiram,"[0, 1]","The terrible film Acolytes could have been a disturbing, claustrophobic thriller. Its intriguing premise features three troubled teens, a threatening assailant, and a cleverer, more malevolent presence. While the opening sequence features the clich&eacute; ""girl running through forest from pursuer,"" its lovely color scheme, jolting edits, and surreal pacing suggest a more affective film than what follows. The audience then encounters three teenagers who skip school and smoke weed. It is unclear why Chasely (Hanna Mangan-Lawrence) prefers the mouthy James (Joshua Payne) to their friend Mark (Sebastian Gregory). Perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that these characters are poorly realized and dully acted. Chasely spends the film staring blankly into space as she listens to music (the movie has a strong indie soundtrack), screaming and crying when the occasion arises (she is a girl, after all), and looking sexy. James is obnoxious and callous, and Mark, our ostensible protagonist, might be the most uninteresting of the lot. They stumble upon a body and wonder if it is connected to Gary Parker (Michael Dorman), a young ex-con who attacked them when they were kids.One minute characters freak out at some horrific development, the next they are inexplicably composed, speaking in their usual, expressionless voices. The highlight of the film, other than its beautiful, high-contrast cinematography, is Joel Edgerton's calm serial killer Ian Wright. His physical appearance is entirely unimaginative (how many movies feature psychos who wear glasses, tuck in their shirts, and sport bland expressions?), but we see flashes of intelligence and habitual sadism. Because this murderer is more interesting than the three leads, any connection with or threat he poses to them drums up little suspense. The ostensibly intense conclusion contains a jarring shock that makes no sense. The film's potential is ruined by a narrative that is beyond jumbled, tediously paced, and unconvincingly acted.",2,Two stars for cinematography and Edgerton,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,2008,"['terrible', 'film', 'Acolytes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'disturbing', 'claustrophobic', 'thriller', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'features', 'three', 'troubled', 'teens', 'threatening', 'assailant', 'cleverer', 'more', 'malevolent', 'presence', 'opening', 'sequence', 'clich', 'eacute', 'girl', 'running', 'forest', 'pursuer', 'lovely', 'color', 'scheme', 'jolting', 'edits', 'surreal', 'pacing', 'suggest', 'more', 'affective', 'film', 'what', 'audience', 'then', 'three', 'teenagers', 'who', 'skip', 'school', 'smoke', 'weed', 'unclear', 'why', 'Chasely', 'Hanna', 'Mangan-Lawrence', 'mouthy', 'James', 'Joshua', 'Payne', 'friend', 'Mark', 'Sebastian', 'Gregory', 'Perhaps', 'confusion', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'poorly', 'realized', 'dully', 'acted', 'Chasely', 'film', 'staring', 'blankly', 'space', 'music', 'movie', 'strong', 'indie', 'soundtrack', 'screaming', 'crying', 'when', 'occasion', 'arises', 'girl', 'looking', 'sexy', 'James', 'obnoxious', 'callous', 'Mark', 'ostensible', 'protagonist', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'uninteresting', 'lot', 'stumble', 'body', 'wonder', 'connected', 'Gary', 'Parker', 'Michael', 'Dorman', 'young', 'ex-con', 'who', 'attacked', 'when', 'were', 'kids.One', 'minute', 'characters', 'freak', 'out', 'horrific', 'development', 'next', 'are', 'inexplicably', 'composed', 'speaking', 'usual', 'expressionless', 'voices', 'highlight', 'film', 'other', 'beautiful', 'high-contrast', 'cinematography', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'calm', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ian', 'Wright', 'physical', 'appearance', 'entirely', 'unimaginative', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'feature', 'psychos', 'who', 'wear', 'glasses', 'tuck', 'shirts', 'sport', 'bland', 'expressions', 'see', 'flashes', 'intelligence', 'habitual', 'sadism', 'murderer', 'more', 'interesting', 'three', 'leads', 'connection', 'threat', 'drums', 'up', 'little', 'suspense', 'ostensibly', 'intense', 'conclusion', 'jarring', 'shock', 'sense', 'film', 'potential', 'ruined', 'narrative', 'jumbled', 'tediously', 'paced', 'unconvincingly', 'acted']",Acolytes
1252121,A3E8Y4OW8IFFDX,B0026VKXRQ,S. P. Miskowski,"[7, 7]","Acolytes is a 2008 Australian film with a premise both simple and unusual: Three teenage friends stumble across a burial spot in the woods, identify a serial killer, and decide to blackmail him into committing a crime on their behalf. This is not a plan born out of restless boredom. The crime, it seems, is a form of rude justice for an act of violence that occurred several years earlier.Present day scenes feature the friends' daily wanderings across a hideously boring suburban neighborhood. We never see concerned adults--other than law enforcement officers--taking an interest in anything they do. Loving parents will find this appalling, but honest ones will admit that a lot of teens live this way. Unsupervised and disconnected from parents who are busy working or just not that interested, the young people in this story create meaning and relationships from scratch. What they come up with is sometimes touching and sad, but it is also dangerous and potentially self-destructive.The story deepens with a series of flashbacks. Every creepy revelation and each new act of brutality builds naturally and inexorably upon the last, until the horrific ending seems both surprising and inevitable. Only one moment, late in the film--when two of the teens rush to aid the third at their usual meeting place--seems unlikely. There is a missing bridge here, a scene of reconciliation between the two boys, which would justify the action.Director Jon Hewitt has coaxed believable performances from his cast. And he's framed them--both teens and adults--with a soulless backdrop that makes the word ""community"" seem ridiculous. Both the natural world and suburban limbo are revealed as places that hold frightening mysteries, down winding roads and behind closed doors.",3,Teens Who Won't Bore You To Death,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,1768,"['Acolytes', '2008', 'Australian', 'film', 'premise', 'simple', 'unusual', 'Three', 'teenage', 'friends', 'stumble', 'burial', 'spot', 'woods', 'identify', 'serial', 'killer', 'decide', 'blackmail', 'committing', 'crime', 'behalf', 'not', 'plan', 'born', 'restless', 'boredom', 'crime', 'form', 'rude', 'justice', 'act', 'violence', 'occurred', 'several', 'years', 'earlier.Present', 'day', 'scenes', 'feature', 'friends', 'daily', 'wanderings', 'hideously', 'boring', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'never', 'see', 'concerned', 'adults', 'other', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'taking', 'interest', 'anything', 'do', 'Loving', 'parents', 'will', 'find', 'appalling', 'honest', 'ones', 'will', 'admit', 'lot', 'teens', 'live', 'way', 'Unsupervised', 'disconnected', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'busy', 'working', 'just', 'not', 'interested', 'young', 'people', 'story', 'create', 'meaning', 'relationships', 'scratch', 'What', 'come', 'up', 'sometimes', 'touching', 'sad', 'also', 'dangerous', 'potentially', 'self-destructive.The', 'story', 'deepens', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'creepy', 'revelation', 'new', 'act', 'brutality', 'builds', 'naturally', 'inexorably', 'last', 'horrific', 'ending', 'surprising', 'inevitable', 'Only', 'one', 'moment', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'two', 'teens', 'rush', 'aid', 'third', 'usual', 'meeting', 'place', 'unlikely', 'missing', 'bridge', 'here', 'scene', 'reconciliation', 'two', 'boys', 'would', 'justify', 'action.Director', 'Jon', 'Hewitt', 'coaxed', 'believable', 'performances', 'cast', 'framed', 'teens', 'adults', 'soulless', 'backdrop', 'word', 'community', 'seem', 'ridiculous', 'natural', 'world', 'suburban', 'limbo', 'are', 'revealed', 'places', 'hold', 'frightening', 'mysteries', 'down', 'winding', 'roads', 'behind', 'closed', 'doors']",Acolytes
1252122,A96JD9312DHWC,B0026VKXRQ,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[1, 1]","The plot, on the surface, goes like this: Two teenage boys and a teenage girl stumble onto a serial killer's secret stash and decide that it isn't a good idea to turn him in. Instead, they'll get revenge for misdeeds done to them by someone from their past. This seems interesting enough, but things go a little further, secrets are revealed, and things happen that you do not quite expect.I have to give Acolytes one thing, it has some creepy portions to it that just jump out at you. Using a seemingly linear progression headed by days of the week, it moves forward then hits you with cutaway flashbacks and unexpected sounds, barraging its audience with things that get the heart pumping. Sometimes they are nothing - seems strange to find a person's leg frightening or a tree scary, but cuts and loud sounds have that effect. This is a good thing and it is not overused, making the first half of the movie seem like it is going to be a five star thriller. The last half is, of course, where all the piece land and those settle when you know what is going on.The acting in the movie is nice as well, and the characters are interesting to see develop. I actually found myself wondering how portions of the character's lives would end up before the storyline, and the storyline took a few turns that made me wonder where it would end up. i also had some motive questions, and those got answered beyond the typical ""they are just dumb teenagers"" idea. Toward the end it did deviate, making a few pieces come together for a bit of horror continuity, but this was not a bad thing. In fact, the way things just happened to fall into place seemed natural throughout a lot of the movie, working their way in instead of simply forcing their way in as ideas.There are also a few plots going through the movie you wonder about, and some points in the story where it seems like creepiness is coming without a purpose. Those work themselves out, and they make the whole more interesting. Granted, it did have elements you could see coming and those are almost expected. What I did not expect was to want to keep watching this when I was tired, sacrificing some sleep to see it all play out.At the end of the day, the plot does describe the surface layer of the movie, involving a killer and teens and something they dig up. You follow the teens a lot, getting in their lives, and you watch them bumble through an assortment of scenarios on their way toward some twists. I liked the ride enough to give it a 4/5, saying I liked it. A lot better than the idea described it to be.",4,Rule #1: Never Listen to Your Friends.
