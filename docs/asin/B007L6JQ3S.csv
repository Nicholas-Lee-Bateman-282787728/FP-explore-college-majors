1532864,AGGJUO2375PTG,B007L6JQ3S,Beluomo,"[2, 2]","This film is extremely well acted, and the cinematography is amazingly impressive. The opening scene of Act III at Christmastime would itself make a charming lithograph or holiday greeting card.  The legendary music of such icons as Roy Orbison and the entertaining drag shows featuring impersonations of artists such as transsexual vocalist Romy Haag and others really gave the film a quick paced feel.Most heartwarming was the wonderful love story between the 2 main characters, Frank and Jake, which was sadly overshadowed by Jake contracting AIDS. The support, respect, and unconditional love shown to Jake by his friends and lover as his disease progresses moved me beyond words. And no surprise here---Stephen Fry(star of the phenomenal movie, ""Wilde"") gives a wonderful performance as Jake's caring physician, Dr.Marsh.I selfishly wish the movie had focused a little more on developing the love story between the 2 main characters rather than on the hospital scenes and agonizing progression of Jake's suffering.  However, I respect Writer/Director Jean-Claude Schlim's technical decisions because all in all this is a truly great contribution to gay cinema. It's a movie that has it all----homoerotic passion, unconditional love, superb acting, technical excellence, and a beautiful love story and tragic drama--- all coming to a bittersweet conclusion when Frank and Jake's former girlfriend, Carol, embark on a pilgrimage of sorts to Morocco to scatter Jake's ashes and fulfill Jake's dream of seeing the exotic land associated with Jimi Hendrix's legacy.  The beautiful young singer, Nyco Lilliu closes the film with a heart wrenching rendition of ""La-bas"" (""Somewhere"")/""Quelqu'un"" (""Someone"")  Songwriter Cyril Collard himself is heard singing the English version during the closing credits.This is the type of movie that is worth owning, sharing, embracing, treasuring, and celebrating for the truly splendid masterpiece that it is. Along with ""Beautiful Thing"" and  ""Shelter"", ""House of Boys"" is one of the three films that I consider the all time best and most beloved trilogy of gay-themed movies.",5,This Movie Could Melt a Heart of Stone,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2114,"['film', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'cinematography', 'amazingly', 'impressive', 'opening', 'scene', 'Act', 'III', 'Christmastime', 'would', 'make', 'charming', 'lithograph', 'holiday', 'greeting', 'card', 'legendary', 'music', 'such', 'icons', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'entertaining', 'drag', 'shows', 'featuring', 'impersonations', 'artists', 'such', 'transsexual', 'vocalist', 'Romy', 'Haag', 'others', 'really', 'gave', 'film', 'quick', 'paced', 'feel.Most', 'heartwarming', 'was', 'wonderful', 'love', 'story', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'Frank', 'Jake', 'was', 'sadly', 'overshadowed', 'Jake', 'contracting', 'AIDS', 'support', 'respect', 'unconditional', 'love', 'shown', 'Jake', 'friends', 'lover', 'disease', 'moved', 'words', 'surprise', 'here', '-Stephen', 'Fry', 'star', 'phenomenal', 'movie', 'Wilde', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Jake', 'caring', 'physician', 'Dr.Marsh.I', 'selfishly', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'focused', 'little', 'more', 'developing', 'love', 'story', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'rather', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'agonizing', 'progression', 'Jake', 'suffering', 'However', 'respect', 'Writer/Director', 'Jean-Claude', 'Schlim', 'technical', 'decisions', 'truly', 'great', 'contribution', 'gay', 'cinema', 'movie', 'homoerotic', 'passion', 'unconditional', 'love', 'superb', 'acting', 'technical', 'excellence', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'tragic', 'drama', 'coming', 'bittersweet', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Frank', 'Jake', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Carol', 'embark', 'pilgrimage', 'sorts', 'Morocco', 'scatter', 'Jake', 'ashes', 'fulfill', 'Jake', 'dream', 'seeing', 'exotic', 'land', 'associated', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'legacy', 'beautiful', 'young', 'singer', 'Nyco', 'Lilliu', 'film', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'rendition', 'La-bas', 'Somewhere', '/', ""Quelqu'un"", 'Someone', 'Songwriter', 'Cyril', 'Collard', 'heard', 'singing', 'English', 'version', 'closing', 'credits.This', 'type', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', 'sharing', 'embracing', 'treasuring', 'celebrating', 'truly', 'splendid', 'masterpiece', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'Shelter', 'House', 'Boys', 'one', 'three', 'films', 'consider', 'time', 'best', 'most', 'beloved', 'trilogy', 'gay-themed', 'movies']",House of Boys
1532865,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B007L6JQ3S,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[30, 30]","Frank is a gay teen who runs away from his repressive parents in Luxembourg, in order to live his life in the hedonistic, drugs-and-sex fueled nightlife of 1984 Amsterdam. He finds work at the House of Boys, a notorious private gay show club/bordello run by the strict Madame, a drag queen. Frank immediately develops a crush on Jake, his roommate in the club's dorm, who makes it clear that he is straight and has a girlfriend. Of course, being in this line of work suggests Jake is open to other possibilities, and the boys eventually become very close ... too close, according to Madame, who feels it may be bad for business. But the real villain here turns out to be AIDS, then called ""gay cancer"" in the media, which eventually impacts heavily on their lives.A look at the movie poster or DVD cover, or even most of the trailer, could lead you to believe this is just another fluff film about go-go boys playing their customers and each other. It is much more than that, actually a well-crafted coming-of-age drama that is also a nostalgic look back at the attitudes and music of the eighties.Most of all, it is a riveting look back at the early days of the AIDS epidemic, with news clips and talk of the early misconceptions of the disease, and how it affected diverse groups of people. It is obviously sad, but realistic in its portrayal of what actually went on, something that we need never to forget. It also reinforces the concept of ""family"" as being something you are not necessarily born into, and how one should never let go of your dreams. The story is cohesive and well presented, technically excellent, with acting that is mostly very good. Overall, it rivals ""Longtime Companion"" and similar films built around the epidemic, although AIDS is not the main focus in this one.DVD release in the US is 5/27/12, from Breaking Glass Pictures, and also available for download or streaming on various services and on-demand systems. Not rated, but would be a solid R for language and sexual content.

1532866,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B007L6JQ3S,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[3, 3]","On December 8th, 1 week following World AIDS Day, I watched an unexpected film titled 'House of Boys'. Expecting a cute sexy, even funny film, I was instead delivered an intense saga of life, and death from a film set in the mid 1980's in Amsterdam. It took me back 20 plus years, when as a nation in America, we watched people die of ignorance and an inability to beat the disease. Ironically, the film made me a bit angry. Angry that in 2012, we're still fighting AIDS, and worse, people are still becoming infected. I've never been to Amsterdam, and I hear it's still far more liberal than America, but even there, efforts are being made to change and control the acts of the people.Torch Song Trilogyis to the 70's what House of Boys is to the 80's. Both are set in nightlife venues catering to/for members of the gay community.  But House of Boys adds the dire consequence of a relatively unknown and deadly diseases in it's earliest days.  I was honestly shocked that the film was made around 2009.  Unlike others, this one is a real unexpected slap across the face.  Much of the films centers around our cast of young male dancers (""dancer for money"" as Tina Turner said in her 1984 song 'Private Dancer').  While Tina is not on the soundtrack, many other great artists are featured in the film including Klaus Nomi, Roy Orbison, Marc Almond (The Very Best of Soft Cell) and Jimmy Somerville.  It's as easily a true story as any others, and all the characters / acting and directing are 4 & 5 stars.  You will get some cute and sexy fun, but watch for the curve balls throughout the film.Watch this film, if nothing else, for a grim reminder AIDS still kills, though maybe not as horrifically as it did more than 2 decades ago.",5,Unexpected Intense Saga of Life & Death in the 1980's,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,1734,"['December', '8th', '1', 'week', 'following', 'World', 'AIDS', 'Day', 'watched', 'unexpected', 'film', 'titled', ""'House"", 'Boys', 'Expecting', 'cute', 'sexy', 'even', 'funny', 'film', 'was', 'instead', 'delivered', 'intense', 'saga', 'life', 'death', 'film', 'set', 'mid', '1980', 'Amsterdam', 'took', 'back', '20', 'years', 'when', 'nation', 'America', 'watched', 'people', 'die', 'ignorance', 'inability', 'beat', 'disease', 'Ironically', 'film', 'made', 'bit', 'angry', 'Angry', '2012', ""'re"", 'still', 'fighting', 'AIDS', 'worse', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'becoming', 'infected', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Amsterdam', 'hear', 'still', 'far', 'more', 'liberal', 'America', 'even', 'there', 'efforts', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'change', 'control', 'acts', 'people.Torch', 'Song', 'Trilogyis', '70', 'what', 'House', 'Boys', '80', 'are', 'set', 'nightlife', 'venues', 'catering', 'to/for', 'members', 'gay', 'community', 'House', 'Boys', 'dire', 'consequence', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'deadly', 'diseases', 'earliest', 'days', 'was', 'honestly', 'shocked', 'film', 'was', 'made', '2009', 'others', 'one', 'real', 'unexpected', 'slap', 'face', 'Much', 'films', 'centers', 'cast', 'young', 'male', 'dancers', 'dancer', 'money', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'said', '1984', 'song', ""'Private"", 'Dancer', 'Tina', 'not', 'soundtrack', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'artists', 'are', 'featured', 'film', 'including', 'Klaus', 'Nomi', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'Marc', 'Almond', 'Very', 'Best', 'Soft', 'Cell', 'Jimmy', 'Somerville', 'easily', 'true', 'story', 'others', 'characters', '/', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', '4', '5', 'stars', 'will', 'get', 'cute', 'sexy', 'fun', 'watch', 'curve', 'film.Watch', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'grim', 'reminder', 'AIDS', 'still', 'maybe', 'not', 'as', 'horrifically', 'did', 'more', '2', 'decades', 'ago']",House of Boys

1532870,A328S9RN3U5M68,B007L6JQ3S,Grady Harp,"[14, 14]","Some viewers, unfortunately, will pass on this film as the cover of the DVD makes it appear to be a gay sexploitation waste of time. It is anything but that. Written and directed by Jean-Claude Schlim (with assistance from Christian Thiry and Robert David Graham) this is one of the finest films about the early days of the AIDS pandemic and long with `Longtime Companion' is probably one of the more important films for the public to understand the inception of the disease that still hovers darkly over the globe. The cast is rich in talent and the method of unfolding the story is superb.In opening credits we see an apparent carefree young lad running through sunlit cornfields - perhaps reference the path to Oz: where that goes is revealed at the end of the film. It is 1984 and a gay high school lad Frank (Layke Anderson) escapes his rigid parents by moving to Amsterdam where he lands a job as a bar boy in a gay dance club, the House of Boys run by a man referred to as Madame (Ugo Kier) who keeps everyone in tow as well as performing in drag on stage. Frank is assigned a room with a straight boy Jake (Benn Northover) who is the club's most popular dancer and who makes considerable money participating in passive physical gratification for the gentlemen who frequent the club. Jake has a girlfriend who sneaks in through the window of their room at night for trysts with Jake: Frank must then move in with transgender Angelo (Steven Webb) and raunchy mohawked dancer Herman (Oliver Hoare) for the night. Frank is talented and wants to leave his job at the bar where he assists the gentle lovely Emma (Eleanor David) and become a dancer. In the meantime Frank has fallen in love with the unattainable straight Jake but the two become close friends. Jake has been saving his money as a dancer and as an escort to run away with his girlfriend, but when his savings go missing he realizes his girlfriend has taken the money to abort Jake's baby. Jake is decimated by this but at the same time he leans on Frank for succor. The two boys realize their friendship has turned to being lovers. Jake introduces Frank to his way with clients and in the process falls through a glass tabletop sustaining cuts the require sutures. Frank takes Jake to the hospital where they encounter Dr. Marsh (Stephen Fry) who ultimately discovers that Jake has no T cells - and the mystery and cruel head of AIDS arises. Jake is fired form the club by Madame who fears for the reputation of this new plague and Frank and Jake move in together, compliments of Emma. From this point Jake has obvious Kaposi's sarcoma and the rest of the film is how Frank and the friends of the club are supportive. The unique aspect of the story is that it is the straight boy receiving passive sex from clients is the one who becomes infected. The beginning of the film is repeated with the full story at the end.This story could have easily been melodrama but the manner in which the story is handled and the fine acting on the part of the actors involved allows it to rise into the realm of very significant films. It copes with tragedy but it also emphasizes the honest meaning of love in all forms. Highly recommended.

It starts out like a farce, with cartoon good kids and cartoon bullies and cartoon bad parents all interacting frenetically; and the thirtysomething high school kid pumping his thing behind his unlocked door right when Mom and Dad and Little Sis noisily come home&mdash;but does he hear them before they barge in and catch him full-handed? Of course not! Or even like a high school musical (the painfully contrived, amateur Fame-esque dance that bursts out of nowhere on the high school steps as the opening credits roll?) Or God only knows what&mdash;except that it turns into a maudlin, preachy, soapy tragedy long before the end.This is a TERRIBLE movie, in which Luxembourgers talk like Cockneys and the Dutch talk like Americans and everybody always looks like they just stepped out of the shower... and it's all just a crazy, mixed-up, phony mess that's as annoying as gnats swarming around your face.

The title can be misleading as it sounds more like a comical farce.  Far from it.  The movie touches on the pain of being rejected by family due to sexual orientation.  The love that develops between Frank and Jake is heartwarming and the devotion shown by Frank during Jake's subsequent illness is inspirational.

1532883,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B007L6JQ3S,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[9, 10]","Set in the heady days of the eighties, before the onset of AIDS, this is a tale about Frank (Layke Anderson) who runs away from home with two of his friends; they head off to Amsterdam where he is abandoned by them. He then stumbles on `The House of Boys', who are looking for dancers, so he applies. Madame gives him a job behind the bar instead as he has to work his way up and tells him he can room with top dancer Jake (Benn Northover). Benn has a girlfriend and is allegedly straight, but this does not  stop young Frank from falling for him.Jake also has a troubled past and we are allowed glimpses of that in flashback; he also does `private' work for his clients at the club. During one such session Jake collapses and has to be taken to hospital where it is discovered that he has a problem with his blood.This is a film about love; it uses the setting of this cabaret, backroom club as the vehicle. It also tries to chart the screaming lack of concern and research that happened in the early days of the AIDS virus. It is even referred to as `the gay cancer' by one doctor. Stephen Fry puts in an appearance as the caring doc too.This is not a sex fest although there is a smattering of bedroom and risqu&eacute; dance routines, but for any seasoned clubber there is nothing here to make you spill your cocktail. It is also nice to see that groin grabbing whilst dancing was not invented by the hippity hoppity brigade as there is plenty of that going on here. The music is quite authentic, with Soft Cell, Spandau Ballet and a few other tunes from the era.Most of the acting is creditable but some bit players that are more drama queen than award nomination material, which can be awkward at times. The lads are mostly sexy enough but some of the cabaret `turns' would not last 2 minutes in a modern club, you need more than make up to put on a good show dears, is all I am going to say.Still this tells of an important time in gay and world history through the microcosm of a few peoples experience with the disease and there are both good and bad times along the way. This is a two hour film and it kept me gripped throughout. Jean Claude Schlimm (`Shadow of The Vampire') has given us a touching, well made and very relevant story that should make you think and only the hardest heart would not be moved by this great piece of cinema.",4,"""A Fairy Tale""",1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,2348,"['Set', 'heady', 'days', 'eighties', 'onset', 'AIDS', 'tale', 'Frank', 'Layke', 'Anderson', 'who', 'away', 'home', 'two', 'friends', 'head', 'Amsterdam', 'where', 'abandoned', 'then', 'House', 'Boys', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'dancers', 'Madame', 'job', 'bar', 'instead', 'work', 'way', 'up', 'can', 'room', 'top', 'dancer', 'Jake', 'Benn', 'Northover', 'Benn', 'girlfriend', 'allegedly', 'straight', 'not', 'stop', 'young', 'Frank', 'falling', 'him.Jake', 'also', 'troubled', 'past', 'are', 'allowed', 'glimpses', 'flashback', 'also', 'private', 'work', 'clients', 'club', 'one', 'such', 'session', 'Jake', 'collapses', 'be', 'taken', 'hospital', 'where', 'discovered', 'problem', 'blood.This', 'film', 'love', 'setting', 'cabaret', 'backroom', 'club', 'vehicle', 'also', 'chart', 'screaming', 'lack', 'concern', 'research', 'happened', 'early', 'days', 'AIDS', 'virus', 'even', 'referred', 'gay', 'cancer', 'one', 'doctor', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'appearance', 'caring', 'doc', 'too.This', 'not', 'sex', 'fest', 'smattering', 'bedroom', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'dance', 'routines', 'seasoned', 'clubber', 'nothing', 'here', 'make', 'spill', 'cocktail', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'groin', 'grabbing', 'whilst', 'dancing', 'was', 'not', 'invented', 'hippity', 'hoppity', 'brigade', 'plenty', 'going', 'here', 'music', 'quite', 'authentic', 'Soft', 'Cell', 'Spandau', 'Ballet', 'few', 'other', 'tunes', 'era.Most', 'acting', 'creditable', 'bit', 'players', 'are', 'more', 'drama', 'queen', 'award', 'nomination', 'material', 'can', 'be', 'awkward', 'times', 'lads', 'are', 'mostly', 'sexy', 'enough', 'cabaret', 'turns', 'would', 'not', 'last', '2', 'minutes', 'modern', 'club', 'need', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'dears', 'am', 'going', 'say.Still', 'tells', 'important', 'time', 'gay', 'world', 'history', 'microcosm', 'few', 'peoples', 'experience', 'disease', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'way', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'kept', 'gripped', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Schlimm', 'Shadow', 'Vampire', 'given', 'touching', 'well', 'made', 'very', 'relevant', 'story', 'should', 'make', 'think', 'only', 'hardest', 'heart', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'great', 'piece', 'cinema']",House of Boys
