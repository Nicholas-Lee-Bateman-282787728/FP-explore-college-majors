The taxi stops at a cemetery. ""Do you believe those spooky stories?"" The rural town of Willow Point is 25 miles from a big city. It is Halloween, kids dress up for school. Grandpa sneaks a cigarette. Kids ride bicycles to school, others walk or take a bus. One boy plays a joke by wet cement. [Funny?] Frankie reads a story. School ends, the students leave. Will Frankie's friends play a trick on him? [Will he learn anything?] He sleeps and dreams of his mother's funeral. He sees a young girl; is it a ghost? There is a strange man there, he attacks Frankie! Has he died? The young girl is Melissa; she is also lost. Then he wakes up, rescued.There is news from the courthouse: a man is accused of murders! Eleven children gone. There is a rumor of a ""Lady in White"" who roams that area at night. Later, we see a lady in white walking near the cliffs at night. There is drama in church, hatred of the wife of the accused murderer. Weeks pass, Christmas was closer. Frankie found some items, such as a man's ring. We see scenes of family life. Later Frankie and his friends enter an old house inhabited by an old woman. Frankie tells Gino about the old ring he found. At night Frankie sees the ghost of Melissa and leaves his home. His brother Gino follows. They sleep late the next day. Later Harold Williams is released for lack of evidence. A woman talks to him, then there is a shot. Gino learns who owned that ring! Frankie recognizes that tune. ""Open the door!"" There is a chase in the woods. ""Where is it?"" Then something happens.That old recluse talks to Frankie in a candle-lit room. Then there is a surprise. The candles fall over. There is a struggle by the cliff! The Lady in White appears to save Frankie. Then she flies away towards the burning house. A happy ending? The search team looks for Frankie. There is more drama. ""Take it!"" Then there is the sort of ending you would expect from this story.This story suffers from trying to cover too many topics: a film set in a 1962 rural town, a ghost or horror story, and murder mystery that involves a serial killer. It doesn't do any of these things well, the aims are conflicting. I think it is quite unlikely for a serial killer to operate within a small rural town because of its society. You need the impersonal life of a big city for a serial killer to operate [""Devil in the White City""]. Small-town society is famous for the interest shown in neighbors and passers-by. Any dog would bark at a stranger too, even if in a car. The lack of dogs is another anachronism. It is more likely that a teen-age boy in 1962 would have a .22 rifle or 20 gauge shotgun to shoot at targets than a bow and arrow.",2,A Horror Story in a Small Town,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,2789,"['Lady', 'White', '1988', 'filmAn', 'airplane', 'airport', 'passenger', 'taxicab', 'returning', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'taxi', 'cemetery', 'Do', 'believe', 'spooky', 'stories', 'rural', 'town', 'Willow', 'Point', '25', 'miles', 'big', 'city', 'Halloween', 'kids', 'dress', 'up', 'school', 'Grandpa', 'cigarette', 'Kids', 'ride', 'bicycles', 'school', 'others', 'walk', 'take', 'bus', 'One', 'boy', 'joke', 'wet', 'cement', '[', 'Funny', ']', 'Frankie', 'story', 'School', 'students', 'leave', 'Will', 'Frankie', 'friends', 'play', 'trick', '[', 'Will', 'learn', 'anything', 'dreams', 'mother', 'funeral', 'young', 'girl', 'ghost', 'strange', 'man', 'there', 'Frankie', 'died', 'young', 'girl', 'Melissa', 'also', 'lost', 'Then', 'up', 'news', 'courthouse', 'man', 'accused', 'murders', 'Eleven', 'children', 'gone', 'rumor', 'Lady', 'White', 'who', 'roams', 'area', 'night', 'Later', 'see', 'lady', 'white', 'walking', 'cliffs', 'night', 'drama', 'church', 'hatred', 'wife', 'accused', 'murderer', 'Weeks', 'pass', 'Christmas', 'was', 'closer', 'Frankie', 'found', 'items', 'such', 'man', 'ring', 'see', 'scenes', 'family', 'life', 'Later', 'Frankie', 'friends', 'enter', 'old', 'house', 'inhabited', 'old', 'woman', 'Frankie', 'Gino', 'old', 'ring', 'found', 'night', 'Frankie', 'ghost', 'Melissa', 'home', 'brother', 'Gino', 'sleep', 'late', 'next', 'day', 'Later', 'Harold', 'Williams', 'released', 'lack', 'evidence', 'woman', 'talks', 'then', 'shot', 'Gino', 'who', 'owned', 'ring', 'Frankie', 'tune', 'Open', 'door', 'chase', 'woods', 'Where', 'Then', 'something', 'happens.That', 'old', 'recluse', 'talks', 'Frankie', 'candle-lit', 'room', 'Then', 'surprise', 'candles', 'fall', 'over', 'struggle', 'cliff', 'Lady', 'White', 'save', 'Frankie', 'Then', 'away', 'burning', 'house', 'happy', 'ending', 'search', 'team', 'Frankie', 'more', 'drama', 'Take', 'Then', 'sort', 'ending', 'would', 'expect', 'story.This', 'story', 'suffers', 'trying', 'cover', 'too', 'many', 'topics', 'film', 'set', '1962', 'rural', 'town', 'ghost', 'horror', 'story', 'murder', 'mystery', 'serial', 'killer', ""n't"", 'do', 'things', 'well', 'aims', 'are', 'conflicting', 'think', 'quite', 'unlikely', 'serial', 'killer', 'operate', 'small', 'rural', 'town', 'society', 'need', 'impersonal', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'serial', 'killer', 'operate', '[', 'Devil', 'White', 'City', ']', 'Small-town', 'society', 'famous', 'interest', 'shown', 'neighbors', 'passers-by', 'dog', 'would', 'bark', 'stranger', 'too', 'even', 'car', 'lack', 'dogs', 'anachronism', 'more', 'likely', 'teen-age', 'boy', '1962', 'would', 'have', '.22', 'rifle', '20', 'gauge', 'shotgun', 'shoot', 'targets', 'bow', 'arrow']",N/A

The boy escapes, but is followed home by the ghosts of Melissa and the mysterious Lady in White, who is said to haunt the rocky cliffs from which Melissa's body was thrown. Now, it will be up to him to oust the murderer and free their spirits forever! Director Frank Laloggia revisits the ghosts of his childhood in LADY IN WHITE, a stylish and atmospheric haunt with good old-fashioned sensibilities! Laloggia paints a dreamy landscape for his spirits to wander through using deep, saturated colors and wonderfully dressed sets found all throughout his native town of Rochester, where the legend was born. The process photography used to bring the ghosts to life is crude but effective, falling back on traditional techniques from early Horror. Despite its light mood, LADY IN WHITE deals with very dark subject matter, including the rape and murder of several children and extreme racial prejudice. It also produces intense moments of gripping suspense as Frankie draws closer to the truth.

Diaz ""losman""","[3, 4]","You know there should be a rule that not all horror films have to have blood and guts and with so few good ghosts stories its great to find one worth viewing. Taking a cue from Ray Bradbury, Director Frank LaLoggia brings a haunting tale that uses some of the more classic elements of fright and suspense that made films of the sixties great. The Lady In White opens up to a small New England town during the Halloween season of the early 1960's. A young boy and his brother bicycle past the storefronts and the whole town is preparing to enjoy another holiday season. At school the young boy thrills his class with a creepy tale of terror, and giving his teacher a strange sense of shock. The young boy meets with his friends and ends up locked in a closet due to a cruel prank. Later that evening the young boy sees a ghost of a young girl who was murdered years before. Shortly afterward someone enters the closet to search for a missing item, the boy startles the intruder and is caught and choked. In a weird series of events we are witness to the boys death and the subsequent grief of his family and those close to him, there he again encounters the young girl and the ghost of her mother. His father finds him and the town is relieved for his safety and startled to hear that a child killer may have returned. With the fear in the minds of the townsfolk's a black man is caught and may very well be innocent. The whole town is a frenzy and it seems that the killer may well indeed be someone close to the boy. Are the ghosts trying to tell him something and what does it have to do with the mysterious old woman who lives by the cliffs.

244667,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6301071263,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[18, 19]","During the introduction, Frank LaLoggia, the writer and director of the film The Lady in White (1988), states this Columbia Tristar Home Video release marks the 20th anniversary of his film...which left me scratching my head as it seems like he's three years premature, if his film was originally released in 1988...maybe it was the 20th anniversary of when he actually started production of the movie.  I guess it doesn't matter one way or the other as I thought this was a damn good picture, especially when compared to his previous, debut project titled Fear No Evil (1981).  I don't know what happened in the seven years in between, but I'm glad I decided to give this one a try despite that earlier work.  As I mentioned, The Lady in White was written and directed by Frank LaLoggia, and stars Lukas Haas (Solarbabies, Mars Attacks!), Alex Rocco (Detroit 9000, Freebie and the Bean), Len Cariou (About Schmidt), Katherine Helmond (""Soap"", Brazil).  Also appearing is Jason Presson (Explorers), Renata Vanni (Fatso), Angelo Bertolini (Homer & Eddie), Jared Rushton (Big, Pet Sematary II), Lucy Lee Flippin (""Little House on the Prairie""), and Tom Bower (River's Edge, Die Hard 2), who will soon appear in a remake of Wes Craven's 1977 film The Hills Have Eyes, written and directed by Alexandre Aja (High Tension), scheduled to be released in 2006.As the story, told primarily in flashback, begins proper, we learn the year is 1962 and it's Halloween in the small, coastal town of Willowpoint Falls, where we meet a young boy named Frankie Scarlatti (Haas), his older brother Geno (Presson), and their father Angelo (Rocco).  The boys head off to school, resulting in a series of funny sequences.  Frankie's an imaginative boy, presenting one of his stories to the class, which results in, later on, two bullies from his class playing a prank on him by locking him in the cloakroom after everyone else has left...almost everyone.  During the night, Frankie witnesses a disturbing vision involving the apparition of a little girl, followed by a very real attack on himself by someone he can't see.  When he next awakens, the attacker is gone, his father and the sheriff (Bower) are standing over him, and the drunken, passed out African American janitor gets fingered for the assault, along with a series of brutal, unsolved child murders in the area that have baffled the police going on some ten years (turns out the girl in Frankie's vision was one of the victims).  As time passes, Frankie is visited a few times by the little ghost girl, the local legend of The Lady in White is revealed, along with an important clue as to the identity of the real killer, all of whom seem to share some sort of relationship.  There's definitely an evil, predatory presence lurking about the town of Willowpoint Falls, and its focus now appears to be on Frankie...It's difficult to talk about a movie like this because I want to relate much, but don't want to give away too much for someone who has yet to see the film.  It seems like it's been so long since I last saw a really good, old fashion ghost story as the one presented here.  Was it scary?  Perhaps not (to me, at least), but it was thoroughly spooky and well worth my time.  The story does get a little convoluted, but director LaLoggia keeps things moving along very well along keeping the confusion at a minimum.  The film is a bit lengthy, running nearly a full two hours, and I thought some of this running time could have been shaved off by removing part, if not all, of the accused janitor subplot which really didn't serve much purpose other than to provide an obvious scapegoat, allowing the stumped authorities to stop their investigation of a case opened for some ten odd years.  The conclusion of the subplot included the most grisly scene of the film, one that didn't necessarily fit with the rest of the movie.  I've noticed some comments about special effects, specifically towards their `amateurish' look, but I think it's important to keep in mind this was a low budget, independently produced film.  Some of these effects did look comparatively hokey in relation to other films released at the time, but I found this very easy to overlook given the strengths of the film, and the very simple fact the filmmaker didn't try to use said effects to cover up inadequacies in other areas, as is often the case.  For me, the strengths (the story, the characters, etc.) more than made up for anything lacking in this area.  I thought the characters were finely detailed, and the performances exceptional, especially that of Haas, whose expressionistic features really helped enhance specific moods throughout the movie, assisted immensely by a strong, supporting cast, including Alex Rocco, Len Cariou, Katherine Helmond, and Jason Presson.  One interesting aspect for me was I figured out the identity of the killer early on, well before it was revealed (which happens about an hour and half in).  I don't think I was able to discern this because I'm all that intuitive, so perhaps something within the story tipped its hand, a predictability of sorts, I'm unsure, but knowing this critical bit of information before the actual reveal didn't diminish my enjoyment of the story at all.  It provided a little twist my knowing something the main characters didn't, and heightened the tension in a few scenes.  I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie was while Frankie was reading a story he wrote to his class on Halloween, and we see one child, in a bunny costume, completely mesmerized by the tale, displaying a slack-jawed expression on his face.  I also loved the reply from the little girl who was Frankie's classmate after he finished reading his story, of which I used for the title of my review.  There are quite a few of these comedic touches throughout, many including Frankie's live-in grandparents played by Renata Vanni and Angelo Bertolini, which all play off nicely against the spookier elements.  All in all I thought this was a wonderful film, one that I'm glad I now own.The picture on this Columbia Tristar Home Video release, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), look very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 audio comes through very well.  There had been a previous DVD release of this film by Anchor Bay Entertainment, but that version, while presented in widescreen, was not in anamorphic format.  There's a slew of special features including an audio commentary track by director LaLoggia, along with an intro to the film, a whole mess of deleted scenes, also with an intro by LaLoggia (with optional director's commentary), a behind the scenes photo montage, an extended photo gallery, and an original theatrical trailer.Cookieman108",4,"""I really liked your story, Frankie.

A warm, loving, tale that just demands repeat viewing. Writer/director/musical composer/costar Frank LaLoggia did it his way and it's such a masterpiece.  Ite shown as a flashback of Frankie's life, and the ghost he met as a child.  When he was 9, he was accidentally locked in the cloakroom at school on Halloween night. There he comes face to face with the ghost of a little girl who was murdered.  Later in the night, he is almost killed.  The night changes his life.He soon begins seeing the ghost, and later learns it was a little girl Melissa Montgomery who was murder years ago.  Since that time more children have died.  As he begins to solve the riddle of the murders, accusations falls to the janitor - a black man - a touch very reminiscent of To Kill a Mockingbird.  Franklie suspects the accusations against the man were false, that it was someone else, someone very close to him responsible for the murders.It's haunting, atmospheric, but also such a touching family drama, like the running battle Frankie's grandmother has trying to get her husband to stop smoking, and the closeness between Frankie and his brother.Just a touching, brilliant movie that never loses its fascination.",5,A must for viewing for Halloween,1067385600,"10 29, 2003",2003,1301,"['When', 'thinking', 'favourite', 'Halloween', 'films', 'be', 'top', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'warm', 'loving', 'tale', 'just', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'Writer/director/musical', 'composer/costar', 'Frank', 'LaLoggia', 'did', 'way', 'such', 'masterpiece', 'Ite', 'shown', 'flashback', 'Frankie', 'life', 'ghost', 'met', 'child', 'When', 'was', '9', 'was', 'accidentally', 'locked', 'cloakroom', 'school', 'Halloween', 'night', 'face', 'face', 'ghost', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'Later', 'night', 'almost', 'killed', 'night', 'life.He', 'soon', 'seeing', 'ghost', 'later', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'Melissa', 'Montgomery', 'who', 'was', 'murder', 'years', 'ago', 'time', 'more', 'children', 'have', 'died', 'solve', 'riddle', 'murders', 'accusations', 'falls', 'janitor', 'black', 'man', 'touch', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Franklie', 'accusations', 'man', 'were', 'false', 'was', 'someone', 'else', 'someone', 'very', 'close', 'responsible', 'murders.It', 'haunting', 'atmospheric', 'also', 'such', 'touching', 'family', 'drama', 'running', 'battle', 'Frankie', 'grandmother', 'trying', 'get', 'husband', 'stop', 'smoking', 'closeness', 'Frankie', 'brother.Just', 'touching', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'never', 'fascination']",N/A

Love for the material is apparent throughout the entire picture, and it does give the film some charm . . . . . sometimes.But those moments of charm are too few and far between, and no matter how much I actually feel kind of bad saying so, the movie falls flat on almost every level.  First and most important of all: it's just not scary.  At all.  I mean, not even comparing it to other ghost movies and taking it on its own terms, there is not even the slightest bit of spooky atmosphere to be found.  The DVD is covered with all these positive reviews about how ""haunting"" the movie is, but what LADY IN WHITE really is is a ghost movie for children.  And I don't mean that in a derogatory way, I simply mean that as entertainment for adults or even older kids, the movie really fails.

244680,A3OBZOH8PWCZI3,6301071263,"John M. Cozzoli ""Zombos' Closet of Horror""","[6, 6]","Frank LaLoggia directs and writes this ghost story and murder mystery with light humor and a nostalgic touch. It's 1962 in Willowpoint Falls, and in the opening montage, he introduces us to the small town during Halloween, and to the Scarlatti family's eccentricities. Told as a flashback by the older Frankie Scarlatti (played by LaLoggia), we see the story lightly filtered through his memories as the sensitive young Frankie (played by the big eyed and big eared Lukas Haas) let's two bully boys trick him into getting locked into the classroom's foreboding cloakroom. All alone, and a stone's throw away from a cemetery to boot, Frankie soon falls asleep on the top shelf of the closet, by the window. An in-camera time lapse shot, done through the half-moon window of the cloakroom looking onto the cemetery, reminded me of a similar effect used in Hammer's Dracula, where the sunlight rapidly fades to darkness as seen through the tomb's window. Darkness is not a good thing when facing vampires or when locked in ominous cloakrooms on Halloween night, to be sure.When 10 o'clock rolls around, it's quiet, darker still, and also time for the murder mystery and ghost story to begin. Right off the bat I can identify with Frankie: he's wearing a black cape and a Bela Lugosi mask. In a later scene in his bedroom, he also has the Aurora monster model kits displayed in all their magnificence.An eerie reenactment begins as Frankie wakes up from a bad dream involving his dead mother. A cold blast of air enters the room, along with the ghost of a little girl, laughing and playing. An interesting touch here is that this is not an atmospheric haunting, where events merely play over and over again, but the ghost of the little girl responds to Frankie's presence in the room. She seems as startled to see him as he is to see her. But events must play out, and soon she is callously murdered by a shadowy adult figure. Using a black screen process to create the transparent apparition of the girl, the scene is a harsh contrast to the lighter tone presented earlier in the movie, and sets up the next, more violent scene, where young Frankie finds himself in the unenviable position of sitting on the top shelf of the cloakroom when the real child-killer enters, looking for something that dropped into the floor grate when he had strangled the girl some time before.The killer soon realizes he is not alone, and shines his flashlight onto the small black caped form, wearing the Bela Lugosi mask, sitting in the corner of the top shelf. Frankie tries to escape, but quickly has the life nearly choked out of him. An effective out of body experience has Frankie meet Melissa Ann, the ghost of the little girl so cruelly murdered long ago. He finds out she is trying to find her mom. Frankie is brought back to consciousness, and he is soon delving deeper into this mystery.True to form for the sixties, the school janitor, an African-American, is found drunk in the basement and is blamed for the attempted murder of Frankie and the murders of 11 other children, including Melissa Ann, who was the first victim. Reminiscent of To Kill a Mockingbird, the film maintains a good balance between the fanciful--Frankie's adventure with the ghostly Melissa Ann, the blue-lit night scenes in the fairy tale stylized woods, and his coming of age, and the true-to-life painful loss of his mom, the bigotry and pain of loss that eventually lead to murder perpetrated by a grieving parent, and the loss of someone close to him by finding out that person is not who he seemed to be. This theme of loss is borne also by the ghostly Melissa Ann, who is looking for her mother, the ghost of her mother, who is looking for Melissa Ann, and one sister mourning the loss of another.LaLoggia, who, oddly enough, grew up in an urban environment, creates a charming small town nostalgia, and through the use of carefully controlled colors and lighting, brings the hues of Autumn inside to his interior scenes. The pharmacy window decorated for Halloween, and the classroom scene where Frankie reads his monster story to the class, is awash with shades of orange, yellow and the various colors of crisp Autumn leaves. In stark contrast, he uses reds and blues to denote the darker side of this story, and effectively uses dimmer panels to bring the light down or up to transition between important story points in the scene. The overall mood of the film moves from charming to alarming, and back to charming as the story unfolds to its incendiary ending atop the cliffs by the white cottage. LaLoggia's simple, old-time approach using in-camera effects combined with basic process shots enhances the story.All in all, a wonderfully paced ghost story and moral tale.",4,Zombos Closet Review,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,4747,"['Frank', 'LaLoggia', 'directs', 'ghost', 'story', 'murder', 'mystery', 'light', 'humor', 'nostalgic', 'touch', '1962', 'Willowpoint', 'Falls', 'opening', 'montage', 'small', 'town', 'Halloween', 'Scarlatti', 'family', 'eccentricities', 'Told', 'flashback', 'older', 'Frankie', 'Scarlatti', 'played', 'LaLoggia', 'see', 'story', 'lightly', 'filtered', 'memories', 'sensitive', 'young', 'Frankie', 'played', 'big', 'eyed', 'big', 'eared', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'let', 'two', 'bully', 'boys', 'trick', 'getting', 'locked', 'classroom', 'foreboding', 'cloakroom', 'alone', 'stone', 'throw', 'away', 'cemetery', 'boot', 'Frankie', 'soon', 'asleep', 'top', 'shelf', 'closet', 'window', 'in-camera', 'time', 'lapse', 'shot', 'done', 'half-moon', 'window', 'cloakroom', 'looking', 'cemetery', 'reminded', 'similar', 'effect', 'used', 'Hammer', 'Dracula', 'where', 'sunlight', 'rapidly', 'darkness', 'seen', 'tomb', 'window', 'Darkness', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'facing', 'vampires', 'when', 'locked', 'ominous', 'cloakrooms', 'Halloween', 'night', 'be', 'sure.When', '10', ""o'clock"", 'rolls', 'quiet', 'darker', 'still', 'also', 'time', 'murder', 'mystery', 'ghost', 'story', 'begin', 'Right', 'bat', 'can', 'identify', 'Frankie', 'wearing', 'black', 'cape', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'mask', 'later', 'scene', 'bedroom', 'also', 'Aurora', 'monster', 'model', 'kits', 'displayed', 'magnificence.An', 'eerie', 'reenactment', 'Frankie', 'up', 'bad', 'dream', 'involving', 'dead', 'mother', 'cold', 'blast', 'air', 'enters', 'room', 'ghost', 'little', 'girl', 'laughing', 'playing', 'interesting', 'touch', 'here', 'not', 'atmospheric', 'haunting', 'where', 'events', 'merely', 'play', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'ghost', 'little', 'girl', 'responds', 'Frankie', 'presence', 'room', 'as', 'startled', 'see', 'see', 'events', 'must', 'play', 'out', 'soon', 'callously', 'murdered', 'shadowy', 'adult', 'figure', 'Using', 'black', 'screen', 'process', 'create', 'transparent', 'apparition', 'girl', 'scene', 'harsh', 'contrast', 'lighter', 'tone', 'presented', 'earlier', 'movie', 'up', 'next', 'more', 'violent', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'Frankie', 'unenviable', 'position', 'sitting', 'top', 'shelf', 'cloakroom', 'when', 'real', 'child-killer', 'enters', 'looking', 'something', 'dropped', 'floor', 'grate', 'when', 'had', 'strangled', 'girl', 'time', 'before.The', 'killer', 'soon', 'not', 'alone', 'flashlight', 'small', 'black', 'caped', 'form', 'wearing', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'mask', 'sitting', 'corner', 'top', 'shelf', 'Frankie', 'escape', 'quickly', 'life', 'nearly', 'choked', 'effective', 'out', 'body', 'experience', 'Frankie', 'meet', 'Melissa', 'Ann', 'ghost', 'little', 'girl', 'so', 'cruelly', 'murdered', 'long', 'ago', 'out', 'trying', 'find', 'mom', 'Frankie', 'brought', 'back', 'consciousness', 'soon', 'delving', 'deeper', 'mystery.True', 'form', 'sixties', 'school', 'janitor', 'African-American', 'found', 'drunk', 'basement', 'blamed', 'attempted', 'murder', 'Frankie', 'murders', '11', 'other', 'children', 'including', 'Melissa', 'Ann', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'victim', 'Reminiscent', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'film', 'good', 'balance', 'fanciful', 'Frankie', 'adventure', 'ghostly', 'Melissa', 'Ann', 'blue-lit', 'night', 'scenes', 'fairy', 'tale', 'stylized', 'woods', 'coming', 'age', 'true-to-life', 'painful', 'loss', 'mom', 'bigotry', 'pain', 'loss', 'eventually', 'lead', 'murder', 'perpetrated', 'grieving', 'parent', 'loss', 'someone', 'close', 'finding', 'out', 'person', 'not', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'theme', 'loss', 'borne', 'also', 'ghostly', 'Melissa', 'Ann', 'who', 'looking', 'mother', 'ghost', 'mother', 'who', 'looking', 'Melissa', 'Ann', 'one', 'sister', 'mourning', 'loss', 'another.LaLoggia', 'who', 'oddly', 'enough', 'grew', 'up', 'urban', 'environment', 'charming', 'small', 'town', 'nostalgia', 'use', 'carefully', 'controlled', 'colors', 'lighting', 'hues', 'Autumn', 'interior', 'scenes', 'pharmacy', 'window', 'decorated', 'Halloween', 'classroom', 'scene', 'where', 'Frankie', 'monster', 'story', 'class', 'awash', 'shades', 'orange', 'yellow', 'various', 'colors', 'crisp', 'Autumn', 'stark', 'contrast', 'reds', 'blues', 'denote', 'darker', 'side', 'story', 'effectively', 'dimmer', 'panels', 'bring', 'light', 'down', 'up', 'transition', 'important', 'story', 'points', 'scene', 'overall', 'mood', 'film', 'moves', 'charming', 'alarming', 'back', 'charming', 'story', 'incendiary', 'ending', 'cliffs', 'white', 'cottage', 'LaLoggia', 'simple', 'old-time', 'approach', 'using', 'in-camera', 'effects', 'combined', 'basic', 'process', 'shots', 'story.All', 'wonderfully', 'paced', 'ghost', 'story', 'moral', 'tale']",N/A

244692,A190KRNWI4E0H,6301071263,Michael Ciardi,"[1, 1]","In 1988, director Frank Laloggia treated unexpected audiences to a sentimental ghost story, which tugs at all the right strings and provides a few genuine scares along the way. There's so many reasons to like this film, from its wonderful cast, to the atmospheric soundtrack, to the well-crafted screenplay; it's easy to see how this became a sleeper hit during the late 80's. It sets out to achieve telling a simple ghost story, but accomplishes much more. Perhaps some of its charm can be credited to Laloggia himself, who apparently returned to his homespun roots to film this picture.Lukas Haas stars as a precocious ten-year-old boy who stumbles upon a mystery while locked in the cloakroom of his school on Halloween night. The film takes place during the early 60's, and therefore Lagoggia devises a subplot revolving around the element of racism in the small-town. This perhaps was an unnecessary attempt to thicken the plot, but it doesn't distract from the main story too badly.This DVD was originally released in 1998, and included the full musical soundtrack, and director's commentary, along with a host of deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes. For a short period, the film was out of print, and copies of the 1998 release had sky-rocketed on ebay. The print is surprisingly crisp on this film, and the sound is remastered for the 1998 edition.Even if it isn't Halloween, this film is a treat to watch any time of the year.

Unfortunately, the world (especially the world of movie make-believe) has moved on a long way since the 40s and 50s and whilst this particular effort would have been firmly amongst the best had it been made back then, nowadays its attempts at scariness merely come across as laughable, whilst its moments of comic relief are too slapstick, or else too hackneyed to be in the slightest bit amusing.Lukas Haas, as the 9-year-old incarnation of the story's narrator, is the only person who gives anything approaching an interesting performance, although even his perpetual wide-eyed innocence and winning smile start to grate after a while. Mostly, though, the film is let down by its entirely nonsensical story-line, as well as the total predictability of all of its attempted mystery threads. And with altogether too many story threads for its own good, many of which get abandoned without development (or else simply get in the way) ""Lady in White"" comes across as a terrible jumble of ideas, presented in an overly long and poor executed package. The blue-screen effects, in particular, are very weak, with some extremely ragged rotoscope work. The overall result is that it is altogether too difficult ever to suspend disbelief at any point within this film, which is a great shame.This DVD version offers little by way of extras to mitigate against the movie's own inherent weaknesses. There are no subtitles, no alternative languages. It does offer a small collection of deleted scenes, but there is (with but one exception) nothing of substance amongst these, with most merely giving alternative, slightly longer dialogue to scenes which remain within the finished (director's) cut. There is a commentary track by director/producer Frank Laloggia, but to be honest, I could not bear to watch the film a second time to find out whether he has anything interesting to say in it.So, if you're a committed fan of the great Hollywood movies of the 40s and 50s, this DVD may provide something of a chance to reminisce about the way they used to do things back then. Mostly, though, I think that all this release does is answer very firmly the question, if any should wish to utter it, why ""they don't make movies like this any more.""

It also  reminded me of &quot;Poltergiest&quot;, and it had a kind of a Speilberg  touch. It just wasn't that scary. It gave you chills, though. Good to watch  on halloween! NOT FOR KIDS.

It can also mesmerize them in wonder by the elegant, effective, and highly creative way that the director handles what could have been a trite or hackneyed subject in others' hands.  Although this film was shot on a budget it is hard to find any scene that would have been better if more money had been available.  In comparison I found the Harry Potter series may have the latest fabulous effects but that this simple story forms a more entertaining and stronger connection between the audience and the hero.My daughter likes this film much more than the other kids' thrillers that I've bought for her such as ""Something Wicked This Way Comes,"" and ""Witches.""

This great period piece of early 1960's nostalgia is one of the better ghost stories you will ever see.It pops up occasionally on TV still.  Lukas Haas plays a young boy...perhaps around 4th or 5th grade maybe, who gets locked in his schools cloak room around Halloween.  While locked inside he is terrified to see a spectral play acted out before him as a little girl is murdered by an unknown man.The killer returns to the cloak room to look for something and finds Haas and tries to kill him as well.  He's rescued but now he is haunted by the little girl who wants him to find her killer.He receives messages from her typed out on his typewriter and the record player goes on by itself much to the terror of Haas.  Then there is the mysterious Lady in White, living in the old, run down home who seems a ghost herself.As Frankie (haas) and his older brother try and solve the mystery, somewhere the killer knows who he is and is waiting.Wonderful piece.  Great 1960's midwest nostalgia.  Fantastic performances and a genuine feeling of dread make this a great ghost story.****SEPTEMBER 1, 2005 UPDATE******Looks like I am finally going to get my wish as this film will be re-released this month.
