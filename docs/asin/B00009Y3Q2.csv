Just some quick thoughts on this movie...I saw this movie in the theater when it came out.  Article 99 (1992) stars Ray Liotta and Kiefer Sutherland.  Basically the movie has to do with how the U.S. government mistreats veterans and the VA (Veterans Administration) and deprives them of the benefits they deserve.  It's a very entertaining and intense movie, never a dull moment.  One of my favorite lines in the movie is delivered by Ray Liotta when he says to a bigwig government bureaucrat something to the effect of, &#34;And the saddest thing is, you don't know what the f#@$ I'm talking about!&#34;  That's the government for you - inefficient, they don't know what they're doing half the time, they don't &#34;get&#34; it, they make tons of errors, and all they care about is money and punching out at 5:00 sharp, not one second after.

You've just entered......the Red Tape Zone.In a time of crisis, you learn to be creative, sneaky and employ any usable methods that enable you to do the right thing.  This is the premise of `Article 99' in which a dedicated and conscientious group of doctors do what they can, however they can, to help the patients that have been declined certain procedures.  If It means stealing controlled supplies horded in the basement or maybe hiding a patient somewhere in the hospital to make space for another, it's all part of the plan.  Now throw in a new doctor who arrives for an internship and sees all the chaos and it makes for many interesting and amusing situations.  Eventually, the tone is set for a dramatic showdown with the administration that leads to a somewhat predictable but thought provoking ending.`Article 99', although fictional, has semblances of truth coursing through it at various places.  All you have to do is look at the history of veteran's treatment in this country and the recent unpleasantness surrounding Walter Reed hospital in Virginia and it becomes a lot more distinct.  Fortunately, it does hold together as a solid movie with a compelling plot and a great cast.  With stars like Ray Liotta, Keifer Sutherland, Forrest Whitaker, Lea Thompson, Keith David, and John C.

The film, however, shows a different story.  The film shows the inhumane, bureaucratic-focus of health care when administered by a government agency.  Patients come last and are considered merely numbers.  Doctors are not permitted to consider the needs of their patients.

Watch this film.  Do you wonder why we vets seem angry all the time? Watch this film.  Do you REALLY think government run healthcare is the way America should go? WATCH THIS FILM!!!Anyone who believes in socialized medicine should have to endure the Army's medical system where the good doctors have to fight the system  -that is AFTER you get to see a real doctor because REAL doctors are in short supply, it took me five years after my initial release from medical care when I was injured in a parachute accident to see a real doctor again- I had to go through the medics and the Battalion Aid Station, the Physician Assistants at the Troop Medical Clinic and only when I was in danger of being chaptered out of service for my disability did I get to see a real doctor at separation physicals who spotted my condition and referred me to specialists who could at least diagnose if not help me.  Then, I was given the left foot of fellowship on a medical discharge and left to the tender mercies of the VA.I've met some good VA doctors, but the problem is every time you go back to the clinic you see a new one and have to start over again. Or they make and appointment for a test two months down the road and a followup visit six months later to learn the results.Yeah, we need the government to run healthcare.  Now, if I sound political here and it bothers you, leave this movie alone because that is what this film is all about - how government bureaucracy and red tape defeats the purpose of the mission of the VA- or what it's supposed to be.It also details in heartbreaking satire the broken promises to our nation's vets. Yes, I've been treated like a welfare case and worse- a bum. I've been brow-beaten by my doctor when I asked a question about the rating system for disability like I was some sort of bum because I wasn't satisfied with what I was getting. The problem is, if a veteran dies from a service connected disability and it isn't properly rated and recognized, his loved ones don't receive survivor's benefits. But I'm on  a rant here.And today's vets are in for it, too. Tri-Care for Life is a joke and the VA isn't set up to handle the influx of vets coming from the current wars. Those of us from previous conflicts are sent to the back of the line to make room for the new vets.
