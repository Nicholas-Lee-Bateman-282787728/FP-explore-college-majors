His focus is on technological methods to study what was previously (even quite recently) interpreted as merely behavioral or ""crazy."" These are patients with brain damage or, as in the first segment, amputations and the phantom limb syndrome.The last case study was the most intriguing. A young man with severe epilepsy who interprets his experiences as religious. The research into exactly what is going on in his brain during a seizure raises marvelous questions about the nature of religious experience.But the study is as significant for what it avoids saying as what it says. Much of what the young epileptic describes is quite familiar to me as LSD experiences. But no mention of that connection is made, possibly because LSD is illegal, even for research. I have long suspected, however, that there was a connection with epilepsy, especially since having close friends who have seizures. And since epilepsy is a disorder which has been known from ancient times, and often interpreted as ""the hand of God"" in some form, we have to ask those hard questions.I like Dr. Ramachandran very much, and Like NOVA for having produced this documentary. Makes me want to go back and look for more NOVA documentaries that I have not yet seen.",5,Even Spock Would be Fascinated,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1361,"['Neurobiologist', 'Vilayanur', 'Ramachandran', 'tells', 'most', 'fascinating', 'case', 'studies', 'what', 'learned', 'focus', 'technological', 'methods', 'study', 'what', 'was', 'previously', 'even', 'quite', 'recently', 'interpreted', 'merely', 'behavioral', 'crazy', 'are', 'patients', 'brain', 'damage', 'first', 'segment', 'amputations', 'phantom', 'syndrome.The', 'last', 'case', 'study', 'was', 'most', 'intriguing', 'young', 'man', 'severe', 'epilepsy', 'who', 'experiences', 'religious', 'research', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'brain', 'seizure', 'marvelous', 'questions', 'nature', 'religious', 'experience.But', 'study', 'significant', 'what', 'saying', 'what', 'Much', 'what', 'young', 'epileptic', 'describes', 'quite', 'familiar', 'LSD', 'experiences', 'mention', 'connection', 'made', 'possibly', 'LSD', 'illegal', 'even', 'research', 'have', 'long', 'suspected', 'however', 'was', 'connection', 'epilepsy', 'especially', 'having', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'seizures', 'epilepsy', 'disorder', 'been', 'known', 'ancient', 'times', 'often', 'interpreted', 'hand', 'God', 'form', 'have', 'ask', 'hard', 'questions.I', 'Dr.', 'Ramachandran', 'very', 'much', 'NOVA', 'having', 'produced', 'documentary', 'Makes', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'more', 'NOVA', 'documentaries', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen']",N/A

Some of the fascinating things that scientists, psychologists and physcians have discovered about the inner workings of the brain is unfortunately the result of brain injured patients. These people are the subjects of this DVD. It concerns their weird symptomalogies after surviving a truamatic, mechanical head injury, all of them real interesting subject matters but ofcourse the star of the show is the charismatic and engaging, Dr Ramachandran.  He's obviously very smart and the top of his field, Nueroscience but he also has the enthusiasm of a keen five year old boy.  His best asset is his charm and the rare ability to transform his own fascination about the brain into an interesting and compelling subject for the average, lay viewer. The camera loves him and he knows how to engage the camera.  He would make a personable science TV host.  The subject matter is interesting in itself for people in the medical field but Ramachandran makes it interesting for everyone.  Highly recommended, it can be purchased by itself or as a set of three DVD's.

1026783,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B000JJ5F8O,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[64, 67]","In ""Secrets of the Mind"" we gain insights through various tragedies that have affected others, thanks to the logic and insights of Professor Ramachandran regarding what he calls the most complex organized matter in the universe.The DVD begins with ""phantom limb syndrome"" - pain and sensation in missing body areas.  Ramachandran's reasoning, confirmed through a CAT-scan, is that the brain has a map of various body areas, and that eg. the right arm and right face areas of the brain are adjacent.  Thus, missing body areas can lead to interference by those associated brain areas trying to cope with stimulus deprivation - eg. ""cross-wiring.""However, we are still left with the problem of treating pain in a body-part that no longer exists.  Dr. Ramachandran found that placing the remaining opposite body part (eg. hand) into a mirror-box fools the mind into receiving feedback from the missing part and no longer sending ever-increasing (and unmet) signals that cause the pain.Visual activities take up almost half the human brain.  Dr. Ramachandran is confronted with an individual who can ""see"" (detect) movement but not recognize what the object is.  His explanation is that there are two pathways from the eye in humans:  one to the visual cortex that recognizes the object, and other to the brain stem that simply senses movement.  Thus, when the visual cortex link is severed, one would only be able to recognize movement of a fly, but not the fly itself - perhaps the way a lizard views the world.  Similarly, he says to driving - most of the time it is done without consciousness while the conscious brain is taken up in talking of other thinking.Dr. Ramachandran believes that there are some 30 areas in the brain concerned with seeing - separate areas for color, movement, shape, distance and depth perception, etc.  Interference/damage to any one of these areas can lead to oddities - eg. an individual believing his parents are impostors when the emotional response area is cut.Finally, viewers are told that some people with temporal seizures have intense religious or emotional experiences, possibly believing they are a prophet or even God, or sensing an intense emotional reaction to everything - even a grain of sand.",5,Interesting and Educational!,1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,2238,"['Secrets', 'Mind', 'gain', 'insights', 'various', 'tragedies', 'have', 'affected', 'others', 'thanks', 'logic', 'insights', 'Professor', 'Ramachandran', 'regarding', 'what', 'most', 'complex', 'organized', 'matter', 'universe.The', 'DVD', 'phantom', 'limb', 'syndrome', 'pain', 'sensation', 'missing', 'body', 'areas', 'Ramachandran', 'reasoning', 'confirmed', 'CAT-scan', 'brain', 'map', 'various', 'body', 'areas', 'eg', 'right', 'arm', 'right', 'face', 'areas', 'brain', 'are', 'adjacent', 'Thus', 'missing', 'body', 'areas', 'can', 'lead', 'interference', 'associated', 'brain', 'areas', 'trying', 'cope', 'stimulus', 'deprivation', 'eg', 'cross-wiring', 'However', 'are', 'still', 'left', 'problem', 'treating', 'pain', 'body-part', 'longer', 'Dr.', 'Ramachandran', 'found', 'placing', 'remaining', 'opposite', 'body', 'part', 'eg', 'hand', 'mirror-box', 'mind', 'receiving', 'feedback', 'missing', 'part', 'longer', 'sending', 'ever-increasing', 'unmet', 'signals', 'cause', 'pain.Visual', 'activities', 'take', 'up', 'almost', 'human', 'brain', 'Dr.', 'Ramachandran', 'confronted', 'individual', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'detect', 'movement', 'not', 'recognize', 'what', 'object', 'explanation', 'are', 'two', 'pathways', 'eye', 'humans', 'one', 'visual', 'cortex', 'object', 'other', 'brain', 'stem', 'simply', 'movement', 'Thus', 'when', 'visual', 'cortex', 'link', 'severed', 'one', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'movement', 'fly', 'not', 'fly', 'perhaps', 'way', 'lizard', 'world', 'Similarly', 'driving', 'most', 'time', 'done', 'consciousness', 'conscious', 'brain', 'taken', 'up', 'talking', 'other', 'thinking.Dr', 'Ramachandran', 'are', '30', 'areas', 'brain', 'concerned', 'seeing', 'separate', 'areas', 'color', 'movement', 'shape', 'distance', 'depth', 'perception', 'etc', 'Interference/damage', 'one', 'areas', 'can', 'lead', 'oddities', 'eg', 'individual', 'believing', 'parents', 'are', 'impostors', 'when', 'emotional', 'response', 'area', 'cut.Finally', 'viewers', 'are', 'told', 'people', 'temporal', 'seizures', 'have', 'intense', 'religious', 'emotional', 'experiences', 'possibly', 'believing', 'are', 'prophet', 'even', 'God', 'sensing', 'intense', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'everything', 'even', 'grain', 'sand']",N/A
