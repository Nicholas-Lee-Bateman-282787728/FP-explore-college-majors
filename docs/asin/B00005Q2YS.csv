673473,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00005Q2YS,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Bride of the Wind"" has the flavor of early 20th century Vienna, not unlike the recentA Dangerous Methodabout the Sigmund Freud/Carl Jung debate. Alma Schindler (Sarah Wynter) was famous for taking famous men as her lovers&husbands.; She was young enough to be Gustav Mahler's daughter when she married the famous composer/conductor. Jonathan Pryce is superb and subtle as Mahler. He gives the most powerful performance in the film- he struggles with being Jewish (and his trophy wife's anti-Semitism), the death of his daughter, and Alma's affair at a spa with architect Walter Gropius (Simon Verhoeven). Wynter (24: Season 2 (Slim Pack)) plays Alma as extremely shallow and self-pitying. She sees herself as a constant victim of males. When she asks her mother about marriage, her mother advises taking several lovers. Taking lovers is her diversion from developing her own artistry. She's the passionate redhead who conceals her talent on behalf of her famous spouse, not unlike the painter Esme inAngel - Real Life of Angel Deverell [Import]. Interestingly, Freud himself advised Mahler to let Alma compose music. Towards the end, Mahler supported&published; Alma's music. While Alma acts as a Muse... she also constantly discourages the men in her life. After Mahler's death, she has a stormy affair with painter Oscar Kokoschka (Oskar Kokoschka: Erotic Sketchs/Erotische Skizzen (Erotic Sketchbook)) Kokoschka constantly threatens her life. He is fiery, jealous, a tempest. His ""Bride of the Wind"" painting depicts their sensual Eden in the midst of a turbulent world. When Alma aborts their child, Oscar loses the will to live&fights; on the Russian front in the First World War. There's a surreal scene that has Oscar as a zombie, one ofThe Walking Dead: Sneak PeekAlma next takes up with Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius. Bored of his talk of architectural simplicity, she is serenaded with Verdi by Franz Werfel (Gregor Seberg) who would penThe Song Of Bernadette""Bride of the Wind"" is a soap opera about the tumult of 20th century Vienna. The few sympathetic characters are Mahler and Gustav Klimt. Alma comes across as a self-absorbed social climber. The movie ends with Renee Fleming singing Alma's music, sonic proof that the German language and love songs are a contradiction in terms. ""Bride"" works as a campy, melodramatic take on the famous Muse.

My plan was to drudge through a boring movie so Fleming's appearance would make sense to me.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to abandon my plan when I found myself not falling asleep, but heavily engrossed in this fascinating and compelling story!  First off, Sarah Wynter, an unfairly neglected talent!  What a committed and involved actress!  She was totally dedicated to this woman.  You could tell that she researched this woman's life and throughout the filming, really BECAME Alma in the process.  Simple mature sophistication in her acting all the way -- a class act.  Gregor Seberg, who plays Franz Werfel gives a convincing portrayl of his wonderful funny charming character.  Big kudos to Vincent Perez who plays Oskar Kokoschka.  Oskar has a lot of depth and Perez captures this extremely convincingly!The story kinda drags in the beginning but eventually creates a compelling plot.  I thought Alma was written so so well.  She was such a developed character and person.  I grew to really like her.And of course, Ren&eacute;e Fleming was spectacular.  Such a round, rich, velvety cream chocolate of a voice.  Too bad there's less than 10 minutes of her.  However, I'm such the movie's soundtrack has more.I thought this movie was good.  It didn't change my life or anything, but it was very good.

673476,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00005Q2YS,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[4, 4]","Alma Schindler apparently acted as a muse for some of the great creative minds of fin-de-siecle Vienna.  Artist Gustav Klimt, composer/conductor Gustav Mahler, artist Oskar Kokoschka, architect Walter Gropius and novelist Franz Werfel flit around the charming Alma like so many moths to a flame. Nonetheless, in Bruce Beresford's 2001 film ""Bride of the Wind"" (the title of one of Kokoschka's uber-passionate masterpieces which featured Schindler) Australian actress Sarah Wynter's one-note performance does little to illustrate to the viewer just why the glamorous Ms. Schindler exuded such immense appeal.In ""Bride of the Wind,"" we get the impression early on that the highly-sought-after Alma loves playing consort to Vienna's intellectually famous. With an amazing level of self-confidence and assuredness, she puts all those famous gold-digging wannabes from the Housewives of Orange County and Co to 21st century shame.  Alma enjoys mining cerebral power that she harnesses for her own pleasure with a Teutonic efficiency that puts the ""p"" in passionless.  Initially we watch the flirtatious teen collecting famous brains cavorting with notorious letch and Secessionist movement founder Gustav Klimt against step-father Carl Moll's wishes, stealing kisses while tinkling on the piano with composition tutor Alexander von Zemlinsky and indulging in soulful discussions with her actress mother regarding the whys and wherefores of marriage. Alma aspires to be a great composer and works diligently on her scores in spite of urges from parents and friends to do what suits women of her station best: a concentration more on society and less on music.  Despite the feminist theme, Alma's calm, cool and collected machinations nail her the ultimate prize in yesteryear's Millionaire's Club--the esteemed yet misunderstood Gustav Mahler, nineteen years her senior.Jonathan Price's Mahler seems a true portrait of the tortured genius, although the emphasis is sadness rather than maniacal energy.  Forced to renounce his Jewish origins to obtain position, he seethes with inner demons that Alma has no problem growing into full-sized devils--first by pushing her desire to compose herself, acting bored with his reclusive lifestyle and culminating with a wild affair with architect Walter Gropius that she meets while spa-ing in Styria.Once Mahler kicks the bucket, Alma moves on to other lovers in particular Oskar Kokoscha (Vincent Perez), but we never get a sense from where her wanderlust with regard to love actually stems.  The film suggests that all that itchiness comes from a desire to compose but that theme is not really developed until Franz Werfel enters stage right and tells her with piano accompaniment what she needs to hear regarding her musical ego. We never understand Alma's sensibilities or philosophy; we are not privy to what they are.  We don't know if she was simply promiscuous or the epitome of fin-de-siecle modernity as propelled by the new sex-motivation thoughts of Sigmund Freud.Whatever the case, Alma's life was definitely one interesting entanglement after another.  However, authentic costumes, lovely backdrops and a parade of famous lovers factor in positively but overall does not a good movie make. The extra depth that should be present--psychological motivations that make sense of all the absurd passion between Alma and her various lovers is noticeably absent and cannot redeem a vacuous but otherwise lovely-to-look-at costume drama.Bottom Line?  ""Bride of the Wind"" almost mechanically relays about twenty years of Alma Schindler Mahler Gropius Werfel's life.  Ms Wynter plays the lead with a cold robotic intensity that makes it tough to understand why Alma was such a belle of the ball.  Wynter's slight almost gaunt sizing is reminiscent of Keira Knightly's uncomfortable display of wig balancing in ""The Duchess""--instead of the expected voluptuous femme fatale we get a focus on Wynter's moue of perpetual intellectual disappointment framed by an upsweep of auburn hair.

673478,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005Q2YS,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 5]","Welcome to the life of Alma Mahler, literally enslaved by Gustav Mahler who did not realize it, but Alma could not cope with it, just submit and suffer. Then she had a passion for Walter Gropius with whom she will eventually marry but the passion will vanish as soon as the wedding will be consumed, or nearly. She will have some liaison with Oskar Kokoschka, before and after Gropius, but that will only lead to drama, even melodrama.Finally she will fall for Franz Werfel who did not come out of the drabness of the setting too much and more or less kept up with appearances. Alma Mahler may have had some potential but we will never know. She never really performed as a performer, a pianist it could have been, and it is not some seven or so songs published quite later that can tell us what she could have done in music if she had not been stifled by the fame of her husband and then the grandiose vision of her next two men.But the film does not show well enough how she was the real inspirer of Gustav Mahler, the woman who gave him the courage to renege his religion to capture the director's position at the Vienna opera. He will never survive this killing of not only his God, but of God altogether, and when he found out he had killed God he discovered in the wake of this realization that life was dead and that death had invaded life completely and that only the earth was left, the earth on which we tread before being buried in it. Earth the perpetual and eternal shroud. The death of their younger daughter, Maria, was probably the straw that broke the camel's back.He had to accept the call from the earth, from death and go into total darkness now the gate of light that does not cast a shadow was dead, had been killed along with God. That feeling of death, of absolute voidness and vacuum in the world, is so Jewish and yet so beyond Jewishness. That's probably what Alma could not stand up to, the constant contact with death that is so typical of Mahler's music. And now we have re-discovered the music of the Old testament, the Hebraic music codified and organized by King David, we can compare and we can discover its main accents are the same as some of the darkest music pieces Gustav Mahler composed.His wife was just fascinated by this morbidity she felt in the music and could not identify, and that fascination became a sense of duty after she had fallen into the snare and then, when the snare released her, she could never free herself from that call from the bottom of the grave of life itself. This particular film sets the emphasis on the fragile uncertainty of Alma's successive passions that lead to some kind of melodramatic approach and that does not satisfy my real curiosity and consciousness about this world in which Mahler committed the worst crime possible, to kill his own people's God.And God knows history was going to make his people pay for that assassination, which was not only Gustav Mahler's. Maybe it was a crime committed by a whole civilization and imposed in a cathartic way onto the Jews by this civilization turned materialistic.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,"Gustav Mahler's Jewishness becomes an insult, an imprication",1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,3110,"['Welcome', 'life', 'Alma', 'Mahler', 'literally', 'enslaved', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'Alma', 'could', 'not', 'cope', 'just', 'submit', 'suffer', 'Then', 'had', 'passion', 'Walter', 'Gropius', 'whom', 'will', 'eventually', 'marry', 'passion', 'will', 'vanish', 'as', 'soon', 'wedding', 'will', 'be', 'consumed', 'nearly', 'will', 'have', 'liaison', 'Oskar', 'Kokoschka', 'Gropius', 'will', 'only', 'lead', 'drama', 'even', 'melodrama.Finally', 'will', 'fall', 'Franz', 'Werfel', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'drabness', 'setting', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'less', 'kept', 'up', 'appearances', 'Alma', 'Mahler', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'potential', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'never', 'really', 'performed', 'performer', 'pianist', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'seven', 'so', 'songs', 'published', 'quite', 'later', 'can', 'tell', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'music', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'stifled', 'fame', 'husband', 'then', 'grandiose', 'vision', 'next', 'two', 'men.But', 'film', 'not', 'show', 'well', 'enough', 'how', 'was', 'real', 'inspirer', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'woman', 'who', 'gave', 'courage', 'renege', 'religion', 'capture', 'director', 'position', 'Vienna', 'opera', 'will', 'never', 'survive', 'killing', 'not', 'only', 'God', 'God', 'altogether', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'had', 'killed', 'God', 'discovered', 'wake', 'realization', 'life', 'was', 'dead', 'death', 'had', 'invaded', 'life', 'completely', 'only', 'earth', 'was', 'left', 'earth', 'tread', 'being', 'buried', 'perpetual', 'eternal', 'shroud', 'death', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Maria', 'was', 'probably', 'straw', 'broke', 'camel', 'back.He', 'had', 'accept', 'call', 'earth', 'death', 'go', 'total', 'darkness', 'now', 'gate', 'light', 'not', 'cast', 'shadow', 'was', 'dead', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'God', 'feeling', 'death', 'absolute', 'voidness', 'vacuum', 'world', 'so', 'Jewish', 'yet', 'so', 'Jewishness', 'probably', 'what', 'Alma', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'constant', 'contact', 'death', 'so', 'typical', 'Mahler', 'music', 'now', 'have', 're-discovered', 'music', 'Old', 'testament', 'Hebraic', 'music', 'codified', 'organized', 'King', 'David', 'can', 'compare', 'can', 'discover', 'main', 'accents', 'are', 'same', 'darkest', 'music', 'pieces', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'composed.His', 'wife', 'was', 'just', 'fascinated', 'morbidity', 'felt', 'music', 'could', 'not', 'identify', 'fascination', 'became', 'sense', 'duty', 'had', 'fallen', 'snare', 'then', 'when', 'snare', 'released', 'could', 'never', 'free', 'call', 'bottom', 'grave', 'life', 'particular', 'film', 'emphasis', 'fragile', 'uncertainty', 'Alma', 'successive', 'passions', 'lead', 'kind', 'melodramatic', 'approach', 'not', 'satisfy', 'real', 'curiosity', 'consciousness', 'world', 'Mahler', 'committed', 'worst', 'crime', 'possible', 'kill', 'own', 'people', 'God.And', 'God', 'history', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'people', 'pay', 'assassination', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'was', 'crime', 'committed', 'whole', 'civilization', 'imposed', 'cathartic', 'way', 'Jews', 'civilization', 'turned', 'materialistic.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Bride of the Wind

Great creative souls are not like you and me. Their lives are usually filled with the kind of ambition, arrogance, dedication to art (and themselves), and personal tics that make them poor dinner companions. But anyone setting out to make a movie -- an inherently popular medium -- will soon feel pressured to fashion characters with whom we can sympathize, even identify. Hence the weaknesses in &quot;Bride of the Wind.&quot;Alma Mahler Gropius Werfel either married, or had affairs with, half the great creative men of early 20c. Vienna (thank you, Tom Lehrer!) What did she have that they all wanted? To find out, you'll have to look elsewhere. This film's Alma never reveals the passion, intelligence, and wit that got her Gustav and Walter and Franz. Instead, the movie implies that she gets Mahler interested in her by making a few insulting (and shallow) remarks about his music.  When their relationship begins to cool, it's because, among other things, he's been forgetting her birthday.Mahler himself comes off as an odd combination of diffidence and arrogance; onscreen he displays little of the legendary manic energy and hyperemotive behavior that made his performances at the Court Opera seem revolutionary.  I guess the director wanted to stress, in conventional screenplay terms, that he was an Older Man. Even the music he conducts onscreen is taken at a geriatric pace, slower than any of the great recordings of those scores.Things pick up once Alma moves on to Gropius, and especially when she takes up with Kokoschka and Werfel. Yet a kind of dusty solemnity continues to hang over the proceedings, aided by the beautiful but underlit settings and some very pedestrian dialogue.  Renee Fleming fans will enjoy the last scene, and so will folks who enjoy parodies of &quot;American Graffiti.&quot;For music aficionados only:  The guy with the bald head in several scenes is Arnold Schoenberg, a genius whose wildly unconventional music helped form the basis of 20c. classical style. Unless I fell asleep (and I may have), he doesn't get to utter a single word.

673483,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005Q2YS,Linda Linguvic,"[6, 10]","There once was a woman named Alma Mahler, wife of the composer Gustav Mahler.  After his death she either bedded or married some other well-known men in the Austrian artistic community in the early part of the 20th century.  This film is about her life and loves.Sarah Wynter, a very pretty Australian actress is cast as Alma.  She wears some beautiful clothes but her acting is wooden.  Perhaps it is the script, but she never came across as real.  In fact, the real Alma became a well-known sculptor and did compose some minor works, but some of the dialogs about her ambitions seem a little too politically correct for their time and place.  And the film was more about the men in her life than it was about her own accomplishments.  Jonathan Pryce, cast as Gustav Mahler, does a fine job as the older husband who adores his young wife, mourns the death of one of their daughters, and composes brilliant music.  The score contains a lot of Mahler's music, which should satisfy the music lovers.The best part of the film, however, is the costumes and the sense of Austria prior to WWI.  It's a festive and joyful place, full of music and art and parties and beautiful clothes.  I got a sense of the place in a very real way.  Too bad the characters were one-dimensional and belonged in a soap opera.  The romances, while sometimes quite steamy, never quite seemed real.  I can only give this film a lukewarm rating.

673484,AXLN36UV9KGXD,B00005Q2YS,Mr John Haueisen,"[6, 6]","""Bride of the Wind"" is a very appropriate description of Alma Schindler Mahler, the wife of Gustav Mahler.  Like the wind, Alma was really never able to settle down, always moving from one man to another.This breathtakingly beautiful and consummately coquettish woman was married to:  Gustav Mahler, the composer, Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus architect, and Franz Werfel, the novelist.  Between and during these marriages, she found time for many real and rumored affairs with such artists as Gustav Klimt, Alexander Zemlinsky, Oskar Kokoschka, and many others.A fascinating life, to be sure, and a perfect subject for a movie.  And now, the pluses and minuses:Negative:It appears that an over-zealous militant feminist has tried to turn Alma the playboy or playgirl of Vienna into a victim.  They portray Gustav Mahler as crushing Alma's artistic creativity, and stifling her advancement as a composer.  True--Mahler warned her that she would be marrying a man for whom Music came first--unfortunately even ahead of his wife.  But knowing this, she still eagerly married him.  The sad facts of history are that, as a composer, she really wasn't very good.  She wrote many songs, some sonatas and other musical works, but they simply were not remarkable.  Her teacher Zemlinsky told her so, and she admitted it herself numerous times in her diaries.Positive:The scenery, costumes, and acting are beautiful and excellent.  Sarah Wynter is stunningly attractive, which helps demonstrate why so many famous men were attracted to Alma.Some might argue that Wynter (Alma) just walks through the story as each new lover takes his turn in trying to win her.  Yet that is essentially what Alma Mahler's life was really like.  Every man who met her couldn't resist her.  She enjoyed being the quintessential flirt, and she was great at it!If she never acheived her own artistic possibilities, perhaps it was because she was too occupied with falling in love.a Caution:  (or maybe this is another positive) There are some steamy love scenes and some nudity, but they do all seem appropriate.",4,The Quintessential Flirt,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,2080,"['Bride', 'Wind', 'very', 'appropriate', 'description', 'Alma', 'Schindler', 'Mahler', 'wife', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'wind', 'Alma', 'was', 'really', 'never', 'able', 'settle', 'down', 'always', 'moving', 'one', 'man', 'another.This', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'consummately', 'coquettish', 'woman', 'was', 'married', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'composer', 'Walter', 'Gropius', 'Bauhaus', 'architect', 'Franz', 'Werfel', 'novelist', 'Between', 'marriages', 'found', 'time', 'many', 'real', 'rumored', 'affairs', 'such', 'artists', 'Gustav', 'Klimt', 'Alexander', 'Zemlinsky', 'Oskar', 'Kokoschka', 'many', 'others.A', 'fascinating', 'life', 'be', 'sure', 'perfect', 'subject', 'movie', 'now', 'pluses', 'minuses', 'Negative', 'over-zealous', 'militant', 'feminist', 'tried', 'turn', 'Alma', 'playboy', 'playgirl', 'Vienna', 'victim', 'portray', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'crushing', 'Alma', 'artistic', 'creativity', 'stifling', 'advancement', 'composer', 'True', 'Mahler', 'warned', 'would', 'be', 'marrying', 'man', 'whom', 'Music', 'came', 'first', 'unfortunately', 'even', 'ahead', 'wife', 'knowing', 'still', 'eagerly', 'married', 'sad', 'facts', 'history', 'are', 'that', 'composer', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'wrote', 'many', 'songs', 'sonatas', 'other', 'musical', 'works', 'simply', 'were', 'not', 'remarkable', 'teacher', 'Zemlinsky', 'told', 'so', 'admitted', 'numerous', 'times', 'diaries.Positive', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'acting', 'are', 'beautiful', 'excellent', 'Sarah', 'Wynter', 'stunningly', 'attractive', 'demonstrate', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'famous', 'men', 'were', 'attracted', 'Alma.Some', 'might', 'argue', 'Wynter', 'Alma', 'just', 'walks', 'story', 'new', 'lover', 'turn', 'trying', 'win', 'essentially', 'what', 'Alma', 'Mahler', 'life', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'Every', 'man', 'who', 'met', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'quintessential', 'flirt', 'was', 'great', 'never', 'acheived', 'own', 'artistic', 'possibilities', 'perhaps', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'occupied', 'falling', 'love.a', 'Caution', 'maybe', 'positive', 'are', 'steamy', 'love', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'do', 'seem', 'appropriate']",Bride of the Wind

673487,A3TPJOEN2CVO36,B00005Q2YS,S. A. Felton,"[14, 14]","I am writing this review to balance the incredibly negative reviewsI have read about ""Bride of the Wind."" I read the reviews before andafter seeing the movie, and I am aghast at what I've read - reviewerswho happily give 4 (out of 4) stars to (I won't say it) like ""Breaking theWaves"" and ""Signs"" give this 1/2 star. Or how about ""Fargo"" and ""The BigLebowski?"" I think it's a travesty, and I wonder if there isn't some agendathat big-budget movies with top stars have to be reviewed favorably for thereviewer to be ""in,"" while a movie like this can be trashed so unfairly. ""Brideof the Wind"" deserves more merit than most movies if for no other reason thanit attempts to seriously portray the life of one of the 20th century's finest(opera) conductors/composers, though here obviously focusing on his talented,beautiful, outspoken, sometimes even callous wife, who indeed has numerousaffairs before, during (!), and after his death. Clearly the moviemakers focuson Alma because she outlives Mahler by more than 50 years, and has a more""racey"" life.I've been a fan of Mahler's symphonies for years, and I felt that theproducers of ""Bride of the Wind"" correctly chose to focus the bulk of themovie on Mahler and Alma. I found the performances of the actors who playedthe great composer and his wife more than acceptable, though not for a momentwould I call them ""perfect."" I was pleased with the selection of some of Mahler'ssymphonies and songs (though the musician who recommended the movie to me saidthat the conducting sequences were very poor!). I enjoyed Alma's frankly sayingwhat many have felt about Mahler's long, operatic-like symphonies when they firstmet - that is a topic of its own, for sure, though Mahler has won out over time,thanks to supporters like the greats Bernstein and Shostakovich. If not, perhapsno one would have ever made this movie. I also thought that the movie did a goodjob of portraying the tensions in the Mahlers' marriage, the problems Mahler hadbecause he was a Jew who had to convert to Christianity to advance his career, theoutspokeness of Alma, as well as the tragic death of one of their daughters(foreshadowed well and accurately during a scene when Alma asked Mahler why hewas composing music that sounded so tragic, when their lives were going so well).I could go on and on praising what I felt were the good parts of this, the bulkof the movie. The cinematography was also very well done throughout and realistic.The lines for the minor players were for the most part well written and acted.Indeed after Mahler died Alma went on to a number of relationshipswith artists of the highest talent, and I won't argue that this part ofthe movie was as well done as her time with Mahler. But few movies, especiallymovies that attempt to deal with complex lives and issues as this one, are perfect,and other than the weird portrayal of the architect who became her second husband(and who knows if the man wasn't as depicted in his personal life?), I foundthe performances decent. The actor who played the passionate, expressionist painterwho somehow survived after being shot and bayonneted in WWI did a superb job.I must repeat, ""Bride of the Wind"" is maybe only a slightly aboveaverage movie, but compared to the big-budget nonsense that praiseprostitution, misrepresent aliens and crop circles, trite ""who dunnits,""to say nothing of the gore and violence that are the mainstay of Hollywoodfare, the movie is easily worth watching (and enjoying) in my opinion.",4,Much better than the critics are saying!,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,3498,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'balance', 'incredibly', 'negative', 'reviewsI', 'have', 'read', 'Bride', 'Wind', 'read', 'reviews', 'andafter', 'seeing', 'movie', 'am', 'aghast', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviewerswho', 'happily', 'give', '4', '4', 'stars', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'Breaking', 'theWaves', 'Signs', 'give', '1/2', 'star', 'how', 'Fargo', 'BigLebowski', 'think', 'travesty', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'big-budget', 'movies', 'top', 'stars', 'have', 'be', 'reviewed', 'favorably', 'thereviewer', 'be', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'trashed', 'so', 'unfairly', 'Wind', 'more', 'merit', 'most', 'movies', 'other', 'reason', 'thanit', 'attempts', 'seriously', 'portray', 'life', 'one', '20th', 'century', 'finest', 'opera', 'conductors/composers', 'here', 'obviously', 'focusing', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'outspoken', 'sometimes', 'even', 'callous', 'wife', 'who', 'indeed', 'numerousaffairs', 'death', 'Clearly', 'moviemakers', 'focuson', 'Alma', 'Mahler', 'more', '50', 'years', 'more', 'racey', 'life.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Mahler', 'symphonies', 'years', 'felt', 'theproducers', 'Bride', 'Wind', 'correctly', 'chose', 'focus', 'bulk', 'themovie', 'Mahler', 'Alma', 'found', 'performances', 'actors', 'who', 'playedthe', 'great', 'composer', 'wife', 'more', 'acceptable', 'not', 'momentwould', 'call', 'perfect', 'was', 'pleased', 'selection', ""Mahler'ssymphonies"", 'songs', 'musician', 'who', 'recommended', 'movie', 'conducting', 'sequences', 'were', 'very', 'poor', 'enjoyed', 'Alma', 'frankly', 'sayingwhat', 'many', 'have', 'felt', 'Mahler', 'long', 'operatic-like', 'symphonies', 'when', 'firstmet', 'topic', 'own', 'sure', 'though', 'Mahler', 'won', 'out', 'time', 'thanks', 'supporters', 'greats', 'Bernstein', 'Shostakovich', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'made', 'movie', 'also', 'thought', 'movie', 'did', 'goodjob', 'portraying', 'tensions', 'Mahlers', 'marriage', 'problems', 'Mahler', 'hadbecause', 'was', 'Jew', 'who', 'had', 'convert', 'Christianity', 'advance', 'career', 'theoutspokeness', 'Alma', 'as', 'well', 'tragic', 'death', 'one', 'daughters', 'foreshadowed', 'well', 'accurately', 'scene', 'when', 'Alma', 'asked', 'Mahler', 'why', 'hewas', 'composing', 'music', 'sounded', 'so', 'tragic', 'when', 'lives', 'were', 'going', 'so', 'well', '.I', 'could', 'go', 'praising', 'what', 'felt', 'were', 'good', 'parts', 'bulkof', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'realistic.The', 'lines', 'minor', 'players', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'written', 'acted.Indeed', 'Mahler', 'died', 'Alma', 'went', 'number', 'relationshipswith', 'artists', 'highest', 'talent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'argue', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'time', 'Mahler', 'few', 'movies', 'especiallymovies', 'attempt', 'deal', 'complex', 'lives', 'issues', 'one', 'are', 'perfect', 'other', 'weird', 'portrayal', 'architect', 'who', 'became', 'second', 'husband', 'who', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'depicted', 'personal', 'life', 'foundthe', 'performances', 'decent', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'passionate', 'expressionist', 'painterwho', 'somehow', 'survived', 'being', 'shot', 'bayonneted', 'WWI', 'did', 'superb', 'job.I', 'must', 'repeat', 'Bride', 'Wind', 'maybe', 'only', 'slightly', 'aboveaverage', 'movie', 'compared', 'big-budget', 'nonsense', 'praiseprostitution', 'misrepresent', 'aliens', 'crop', 'circles', 'trite', 'who', 'say', 'nothing', 'gore', 'violence', 'are', 'mainstay', 'Hollywoodfare', 'movie', 'easily', 'worth', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'opinion']",Bride of the Wind
673488,AD29KEJMCAD76,B00005Q2YS,Samhot,"[18, 18]","I stumbled upon this film knowing that it was based on Alma Mahler, the woman who was married to classical composer Gustav Mahler. Since Mahler is a huge fascination of mine, I was compelled to watch this film. While Gustav Mahler seemed to be the central focus of the story in the first half, Alma Mahler gets more of the spotlight during the second, which makes this seem like two different films.Like another reviewer stated, if you're a history/research buff, you may notice some loopholes or inaccuracies within the story. However, I'm guessing that this wasn't really intended to be epic material. Other than that, the film is quite artistic, beautiful and seductive. In the first half of the movie, it was nice to see Mahler (played by Jonathan Pryce) conducting parts of his 5th symphony, and some of his other pieces, while gaining a little bit of insight into the personality and thought-processes of the composer, however accurate they were. Some of those scenes were painful to watch (especially when Mahler found out he had heart problems, and he was going to die.) Elsewhere, like the critic said on the page, Sarah Wynter as Alma, had a seductive air about her, as she portrays a woman with talent, lust, passion and heartache. Some of the love scenes in here were quite steamy as well.Overall, if you have interest in Gustav Mahler, Alma Mahler or any of the other historical figures involved in the story, I'd recommend that you view this. Despite not being the most serious or epic of documentaries, there's more than enough ear and eye candy to keep you fascinated.",4,Untitled,1056672000,"06 27, 2003",2003,1584,"['stumbled', 'film', 'knowing', 'was', 'based', 'Alma', 'Mahler', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'classical', 'composer', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'Mahler', 'huge', 'fascination', 'mine', 'was', 'compelled', 'watch', 'film', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'seemed', 'be', 'central', 'focus', 'story', 'first', 'half', 'Alma', 'Mahler', 'more', 'spotlight', 'second', 'seem', 'two', 'different', 'films.Like', 'reviewer', 'stated', ""'re"", 'history/research', 'buff', 'may', 'notice', 'loopholes', 'inaccuracies', 'story', 'However', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'intended', 'be', 'epic', 'material', 'Other', 'film', 'quite', 'artistic', 'beautiful', 'seductive', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Mahler', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'conducting', 'parts', '5th', 'symphony', 'other', 'pieces', 'gaining', 'little', 'bit', 'insight', 'personality', 'thought-processes', 'composer', 'however', 'accurate', 'were', 'scenes', 'were', 'painful', 'watch', 'especially', 'when', 'Mahler', 'found', 'had', 'heart', 'problems', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'Elsewhere', 'critic', 'said', 'page', 'Sarah', 'Wynter', 'Alma', 'had', 'seductive', 'air', 'woman', 'talent', 'lust', 'passion', 'heartache', 'love', 'scenes', 'here', 'were', 'quite', 'steamy', 'well.Overall', 'have', 'interest', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'Alma', 'Mahler', 'other', 'historical', 'figures', 'involved', 'story', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'view', 'not', 'being', 'most', 'serious', 'epic', 'documentaries', 'more', 'enough', 'ear', 'eye', 'candy', 'keep', 'fascinated']",Bride of the Wind
