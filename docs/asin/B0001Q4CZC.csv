812722,A3OT8HDV03UV0U,B0001Q4CZC,IhateMTV,"[2, 2]","(I plan to review the CD version of this in the near future. This review will only be covering extra songs that weren't on the CD, and the extra DVD footage).Compared to other people, I haven't seen very many concerts, but this one was enjoyable. I don't see why they included an extra CD with this, since the DVD has 18 songs performed live, while the CD only has 12 (which are audio copies of the same exact songs from the DVD). I would have preferred seeing this as a two DVD set - one for the concert, and one for the videos. I've seen other bands do this for their Live DVDs, and since the DVD of ""Return of the Killer B's - Video Anthology"" is rare to find, it would have been a win-win situation for every customer.Anyway, the songs on the DVD that aren't on the CD are Belly of the Beast, 604, Be All End All, Indians, Bring The Noise, and Metal Thrashing Mad. The band's performance of ""Bring the Noise"" wasn't what I was expecting, but it was cool to see every member of the band taking different verses to rap on. Suprisingly, Scott Ian was the best rapper out of all of them. We also get some bonus 'behind the scene footage' of each member of the band (except for bassist Joey Vera):Charlie Benante - Charlie goes to a 'figure' store to add to his huge collection. They have some interesting sculptures here, but it's nothing too special.Rob Caggiano - This one was pretty bad, definitely the worst out of the four. I have nothing against Rob, but footage of him on a tour bus doesn't interest me very much. Skipper.John Bush - Poor camera work here, as we take a look at John's collection of alcoholic beverages. Pretty boring stuff.Scott Ian - The best out of the four. This is compiled of various footage, including Scott getting a tattoo and some random clips of other concerts. Seeing him get the tattoo was cool, definitely something I'd recommend seeing.If that weren't enough, they've included a segment where Charlie has a discussion with the artist who did the artwork for ""We've Come for You All"" and the cover of this DVD. This guy is amazing at what he does, as you see him gradually finish his drawing throughout the duration of this segment. It is kind of long, but their discussion of superheroes will keep comic book fans interested.While it's true that this DVD could have been better, it's still something Anthrax fans will enjoy. Add the fact that the price is relatively low and this is worth getting.",4,Nice addition for Anthrax fans.,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,2435,"['plan', 'review', 'CD', 'version', 'near', 'future', 'review', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'covering', 'extra', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'CD', 'extra', 'DVD', 'footage', '.Compared', 'other', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'very', 'many', 'concerts', 'one', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'included', 'extra', 'CD', 'DVD', '18', 'songs', 'performed', 'live', 'CD', 'only', '12', 'are', 'audio', 'copies', 'same', 'exact', 'songs', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'seeing', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'concert', 'one', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'bands', 'do', 'Live', 'DVDs', 'DVD', 'Return', 'Killer', 'B', 'Video', 'Anthology', 'rare', 'find', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'win-win', 'situation', 'customer.Anyway', 'songs', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'CD', 'are', 'Belly', 'Beast', '604', 'Be', 'All', 'End', 'All', 'Indians', 'Bring', 'Noise', 'Metal', 'Thrashing', 'Mad', 'band', 'performance', 'Bring', 'Noise', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'member', 'band', 'taking', 'different', 'verses', 'rap', 'Suprisingly', 'Scott', 'Ian', 'was', 'best', 'rapper', 'also', 'get', 'bonus', 'scene', 'footage', 'member', 'band', 'bassist', 'Joey', 'Vera', 'Charlie', 'Benante', 'Charlie', ""'figure"", 'store', 'add', 'huge', 'collection', 'have', 'interesting', 'sculptures', 'here', 'nothing', 'too', 'special.Rob', 'Caggiano', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'definitely', 'worst', 'four', 'have', 'nothing', 'Rob', 'footage', 'tour', 'bus', ""n't"", 'interest', 'very', 'much', 'Skipper.John', 'Bush', 'Poor', 'camera', 'work', 'here', 'take', 'look', 'John', 'collection', 'alcoholic', 'beverages', 'Pretty', 'boring', 'stuff.Scott', 'Ian', 'best', 'four', 'compiled', 'various', 'footage', 'including', 'Scott', 'getting', 'tattoo', 'random', 'clips', 'other', 'concerts', 'Seeing', 'get', 'tattoo', 'was', 'cool', 'definitely', 'something', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'seeing.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', ""'ve"", 'included', 'segment', 'where', 'Charlie', 'discussion', 'artist', 'who', 'did', 'artwork', ""'ve"", 'Come', 'cover', 'DVD', 'guy', 'amazing', 'what', 'see', 'gradually', 'finish', 'drawing', 'duration', 'segment', 'kind', 'long', 'discussion', 'superheroes', 'will', 'keep', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'interested.While', 'true', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'still', 'something', 'Anthrax', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Add', 'fact', 'price', 'relatively', 'low', 'worth', 'getting']",N/A
812723,A2HRVE5MUWP0PN,B0001Q4CZC,"Ken Pierce ""Editor, PiercingMetal.com""","[1, 2]","Continuing the trend of metal bands that are giving fans the most value for their money is Anthrax and their release of ""Music Of Mass Destruction"".  This Live DVD and CD piece is a good way to enjoy the music of Anthrax in your own ""Safe Home"" as there is no way to be ""Caught In A Mosh"" if you do that (of course that depends on who you invite over to watch and how much room you have where you entertain).  The recording was filmed during the tour which supported the release of ""We've Come For You All"" and it is chock full of Anthrax standards and some of the newest material from this killer CD.  A full 18 songs running about and hour and a half.  You are bound to find some of your favorites on this one.  I really liked the inclusion of ""Got The Time"" and ""Antisocial"" as for cover tunes, Anthrax certainly managed to leave their mark on them for the future.  I also was a big fan of ""Only"" and wish more music from ""Sound Of White Noise"" was featured since that particular CD was a killer also.Looking past the video, I think the aspect I liked most about this piece was the inclusion of the live CD.  By doing this you have killed two birds with one stone as far as product goes.  You can now grab the CD and go to the car or use your walkman and bring Anthrax out with you.  I felt by that by doing this they allowed the band to generate more positive sales numbers.  The increase in music video sales has been widely noted, so this gives fans of each medium the product they desire.  No longer do they have to choose between one or the other when you package them together at an affordable price.  Separating them might have caused a good amount of product to be sitting in discount bins for a long time.  Metal sales are growing again, but we still have a lot to accomplish in the USA.This DVD is the last live video piece to feature their bassist Frank Bello, who left the band shortly after this was filmed. John Bush still handles the vocal chores and is good in a live sense; however sometimes the older material where you are accustomed to something in the high register it is not present.  He is a great front man and gets the audience going big time, but high notes are not his specialty.  Charlie Benante is still amazing as always and his drumming is still consistent if not better after all these years of touring.  Scott Ian stomps about like a madman and really shows that he still loves being in this band some 20 years after they first started it.I felt that this will appeal to casual fans of the group as well as the die-hards.  Check it out when you can.Bonus Features:  The features on this DVD are some bio material and an interesting interview with artist Alex Ross (who designed the album cover for them).",4,Some Highlights/Some Lowlights,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,2740,"['Continuing', 'trend', 'metal', 'bands', 'are', 'giving', 'fans', 'most', 'value', 'money', 'Anthrax', 'release', 'Music', 'Mass', 'Destruction', 'Live', 'DVD', 'CD', 'piece', 'good', 'way', 'enjoy', 'music', 'Anthrax', 'own', 'Safe', 'Home', 'way', 'be', 'Caught', 'A', 'Mosh', 'do', 'course', 'who', 'invite', 'watch', 'how', 'much', 'room', 'have', 'where', 'entertain', 'recording', 'was', 'filmed', 'tour', 'supported', 'release', ""'ve"", 'Come', 'chock', 'full', 'Anthrax', 'standards', 'newest', 'material', 'killer', 'CD', 'full', '18', 'songs', 'running', 'about', 'hour', 'half', 'are', 'bound', 'find', 'favorites', 'one', 'really', 'liked', 'inclusion', 'Got', 'Time', 'Antisocial', 'cover', 'tunes', 'Anthrax', 'certainly', 'managed', 'leave', 'mark', 'future', 'also', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'Only', 'wish', 'more', 'music', 'Sound', 'White', 'Noise', 'was', 'featured', 'particular', 'CD', 'was', 'killer', 'also.Looking', 'video', 'think', 'aspect', 'liked', 'most', 'piece', 'was', 'inclusion', 'live', 'CD', 'doing', 'have', 'killed', 'two', 'birds', 'one', 'stone', 'as', 'far', 'product', 'can', 'now', 'grab', 'CD', 'go', 'car', 'use', 'walkman', 'bring', 'Anthrax', 'out', 'felt', 'doing', 'allowed', 'band', 'generate', 'more', 'positive', 'sales', 'numbers', 'increase', 'music', 'video', 'sales', 'been', 'widely', 'noted', 'fans', 'medium', 'product', 'desire', 'No', 'longer', 'do', 'have', 'choose', 'one', 'other', 'when', 'package', 'together', 'affordable', 'price', 'Separating', 'might', 'have', 'caused', 'good', 'amount', 'product', 'be', 'sitting', 'discount', 'bins', 'long', 'time', 'Metal', 'sales', 'are', 'growing', 'again', 'still', 'have', 'lot', 'accomplish', 'USA.This', 'DVD', 'last', 'live', 'video', 'piece', 'feature', 'bassist', 'Frank', 'Bello', 'who', 'left', 'band', 'shortly', 'was', 'filmed', 'John', 'Bush', 'still', 'vocal', 'chores', 'good', 'live', 'sense', 'however', 'older', 'material', 'where', 'are', 'accustomed', 'something', 'high', 'register', 'not', 'present', 'great', 'front', 'man', 'audience', 'going', 'big', 'time', 'high', 'notes', 'are', 'not', 'specialty', 'Charlie', 'Benante', 'still', 'amazing', 'always', 'drumming', 'still', 'consistent', 'not', 'better', 'years', 'touring', 'Scott', 'Ian', 'madman', 'really', 'still', 'being', 'band', '20', 'years', 'first', 'started', 'it.I', 'felt', 'will', 'appeal', 'casual', 'fans', 'group', 'as', 'well', 'die-hards', 'Check', 'out', 'when', 'can.Bonus', 'Features', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'bio', 'material', 'interesting', 'interview', 'artist', 'Alex', 'Ross', 'who', 'designed', 'album', 'cover']",N/A

Puziss,"[5, 5]","Anthrax are my second favorite of the Big Four thrash bands(Metallica,Megadeth,Anthrax,Slayer).They had released 2 live VHS videos before this,but no DVDs.Finally now we have a DVD.This was shot at the Metro in Chicago on the Taking The Music Back tour.It is a very high energy show.It has a sixteen song set that spans there career from Among The Living to We've Come For You All.I have a few complaints with the setlist.It doesn't have ANYTHING from Spreading The Disease,which is one of  the best thrash albums EVER.It also doesn't have the title track to Among The Living.They played it on their PPV concert from 2000,why couldn't they play it here? The only other thing wrong with this DVD is that the guitar solos are so low in the mix.However,Rob Caggiano does an EXCELLENT job with the Dan Spitz and Paul Crook solos.Some highlights include &quot;What Doesn't Die&quot;,&quot;Only&quot;,&quot;Nobody Knows Anything&quot;,&quot;Caught In A Mosh&quot;,and &quot;Antisocial&quot;.However,the BEST song on the DVD is &quot;Bring The Noise.&quot; This is MUCH better than the one with Public Enemy.Plus,they play the first verse and chorus of Metallica's &quot;Whiplash&quot; at the end.So if you are an Anthrax fan,I highly recommend this DVD.",4,"Finally,a live Anthrax DVD!",1084060800,"05 9, 2004",2004,1247,"['Anthrax', 'are', 'second', 'favorite', 'Big', 'Four', 'thrash', 'bands', 'Metallica', 'Megadeth', 'Anthrax', 'Slayer', '.They', 'had', 'released', '2', 'live', 'VHS', 'videos', 'DVDs.Finally', 'now', 'have', 'DVD.This', 'was', 'shot', 'Metro', 'Chicago', 'Taking', 'Music', 'Back', 'tour.It', 'very', 'high', 'energy', 'show.It', 'sixteen', 'song', 'set', 'spans', 'career', 'Living', ""'ve"", 'Come', 'All.I', 'have', 'few', 'complaints', 'setlist.It', ""n't"", 'have', 'ANYTHING', 'Spreading', 'Disease', 'one', 'best', 'thrash', 'albums', 'EVER.It', 'also', ""n't"", 'have', 'title', 'track', 'Living.They', 'played', 'PPV', 'concert', '2000', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'play', 'here', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'guitar', 'solos', 'are', 'so', 'low', 'mix.However', 'Rob', 'Caggiano', 'EXCELLENT', 'job', 'Dan', 'Spitz', 'Paul', 'Crook', 'solos.Some', 'highlights', 'include', 'quot', 'What', ""n't"", 'Die', 'quot', 'quot', 'Only', 'quot', 'quot', 'Nobody', 'Knows', 'Anything', 'quot', 'quot', 'Caught', 'A', 'Mosh', 'quot', 'quot', 'Antisocial', 'quot', 'BEST', 'song', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Bring', 'Noise.', 'quot', 'MUCH', 'better', 'one', 'Public', 'Enemy.Plus', 'play', 'first', 'verse', 'chorus', 'Metallica', 'quot', 'Whiplash', 'quot', 'end.So', 'are', 'Anthrax', 'fan', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A

I have to take atleast one star off for this big mistake.
