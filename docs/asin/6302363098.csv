Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[4, 4]","If you're a fan of the real-life quadrennial Van Cliburn international piano competitions, chances are very good that you'll enjoy this movie! The fictitious ""biggie"" classical piano competition known as the ""Hillman"" in the movie de facto becomes the Fort Worth Van Cliburn if only by automatic inference.Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving render very believable performances as classical piano competitors as does the quite excellent supporting cast. Fans of Beethoven's magestic ""Emperor"" concerto [5th piano concerto] will like it too as 'Paul Dietrich' gravitates to this great piece more than once. Key fingerings on various classical pieces are also believable unlike some movies where minimal attention is paid to note fingerings and it woefully shows!It's the little things too. The tapping of the fingers on whatever is available when the music is 'envisioned' or the requisite smiling nod but inward disappointment as in real-life when the names are read and being a finalist or indeed first place itself was secretly hoped for but, alas, not in the cards. On the other hand, there are always the surprises! You know, move to the real-life 2005 Van Cliburn and the media dubbed ""the undertaker"" [sic] for Alexander Kobrin yet, how can I put it, Kobrin got in the last 'dig', as it were, for taking home the gold medal!It's the essence of classical piano competitions and the focus mercifully remains the competition versus an overboard emphasis on the romance connection between Dreyfuss and Irving. Excellent characterizations and you'll quickly recognize the all too often 'walk on water' presumptions and demeanor of the conductor which is brilliantly played by Sam Wanamaker.Doc Tony",5,It's the Van Cliburn by cinematic inference!,1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,1695,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'real-life', 'quadrennial', 'Van', 'Cliburn', 'international', 'piano', 'competitions', 'chances', 'are', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'fictitious', 'biggie', 'classical', 'piano', 'competition', 'known', 'Hillman', 'movie', 'de', 'facto', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'Van', 'Cliburn', 'only', 'automatic', 'inference.Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'render', 'very', 'believable', 'performances', 'classical', 'piano', 'competitors', 'quite', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Fans', 'Beethoven', 'magestic', 'Emperor', 'concerto', '[', '5th', 'piano', 'concerto', ']', 'will', 'like', 'too', ""'Paul"", 'Dietrich', 'gravitates', 'great', 'piece', 'more', 'once', 'Key', 'fingerings', 'various', 'classical', 'pieces', 'are', 'also', 'believable', 'movies', 'where', 'minimal', 'attention', 'paid', 'note', 'fingerings', 'woefully', 'little', 'things', 'too', 'tapping', 'fingers', 'available', 'when', 'music', ""'envisioned"", 'requisite', 'smiling', 'nod', 'inward', 'disappointment', 'real-life', 'when', 'names', 'are', 'read', 'being', 'finalist', 'indeed', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'secretly', 'hoped', 'alas', 'not', 'cards', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'always', 'surprises', 'know', 'move', 'real-life', '2005', 'Van', 'Cliburn', 'media', 'dubbed', 'undertaker', 'sic', ']', 'Alexander', 'Kobrin', 'yet', 'how', 'can', 'put', 'Kobrin', 'got', 'last', ""'dig"", 'were', 'taking', 'home', 'gold', 'medal', 'essence', 'classical', 'piano', 'competitions', 'focus', 'mercifully', 'competition', 'overboard', 'emphasis', 'romance', 'connection', 'Dreyfuss', 'Irving', 'Excellent', 'characterizations', ""'ll"", 'quickly', 'recognize', 'too', 'often', ""'walk"", 'water', 'presumptions', 'demeanor', 'conductor', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Sam', 'Wanamaker.Doc', 'Tony']",The Competition VHS

The piano competitors, the teacher, the conductor, and the candlestick maker are little more than a collection of circumscribed, mechanical strawmen.  The  personalities assigned to the supporting actors amount to predictable  stereotypes.  Rich in great music but empty of substance or purpose, the  viewer is starved of any hopes of a proper introduction to classical music  or artists.The movie succeeds in its portrayal of oddness in certain  characters, and indeed many classical musicians, myself included, possess  such oddness.  But a personality, however odd, at least possesses life.  The movie fails to deliver this critical piece of substance in its extras.  Further, The Competition demonstrates an enormous ignorance of contemporary  classical music to the point of nausea.  It seems the conductor in this  flick introduces such &quot;weird&quot; music to ladies back at his crib  while getting them high and coming on to them.  The producer is apparently  saying that contemporary music is good for nothing else and that its  composers must belong to the same ilk as the average beatnik dreamer.  The  truth of the few contemporary masters among us is almost a perfect about  face of this rendering.This piece is fine for a casual, curled up  viewing of a love story with one's lover and a bottle of wine.

Such as interviews with the actual pianists who performed the works for this movie including piano professors I have studied with including: Daniel Pollock (who plays the Prokofiev Concerto no. 3 for Amy Irving's character), and Eduardo Delgado who performs the last movement of Alberto Ginastera's Piano Sonata. no. 1 for Richard Dreyfuss character.What I love about this movie:1.  All the pianists specifically Richard and Amy do an extraordinary job of playing convincing concert pianists. I read where they rehearsed for hours to make sure finger placements look realistic.  As a pianist who has played both the Prokofiev and the Mozart, I was nearly shocked at how authentic the acting looked.2. The dynamic between Lee Remick and Sam (Amy's piano coach and the conductor) is so high camp which makes for a funny bit of comedic relief.3. Add in the cheesy period of disco and the other characters makes for a funny yet endearing movie.4. Not to mention you get to hear vignettes of some of the best piano concerti ever composed.Some fun notes about the movie.The actual location for the competition is the San Francisco Aquarium.The format of the competition was indeed accurate to many competitions I have played in.I highly recommend this excellent movie to all classical music and piano lovers.J.

It is his chance to compete for such a prize while she gets entered by her teacher without her knowledge.  Some political intrique involving a young Russian pianist gives the competitors some down time and the young couple makes the most of it.  Okay, so the romance is sappy, I watch this movie for the music.  Paul plays Beethoven's &quot;Emperor&quot; Piano Concerto (No. 5 for those who need the number), while Heidi tackles Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3.  This is one of those films where you go out and track down the complete piano concertos the first chance you get (For the record, Chester B. Swiatkowski is the actual pianist for the &quot;Emperor&quot; while Daniel Pollack plays the Prokofiev).  The supporting performances by Lee Remick as Heidi's teacher Greta Vandemann, and Sam Wanamaker as temperamental conductor Andrew Erskine are both quite excellent.  I can never forget Remick's great line to Erskine: &quot;It costs extra to carve schmuck on a tombstone, but you would be worth the expense.&quot;  Besides, nobody can arch an eyebrow like Lee Remick.  The other competitors in the finals are Jerry DiSalvo (Joseph Cali), who is playing the rags to riches angle, Michael Humphries (Ty Henderson), who already has the money, poor little Russian girl Tatjana Baronov (Vicki Kriegler), and the silent Adam Stern (Mark Landau).

While I myself am not a pianist, I do know a thing or two about classical music, and the ""faked"" performances of Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving are astonishingly well staged. They have hit their marks superbly, with split-second accuracy, not to mention convincing effort and timing. The blossoming love affair is intriguing, but I found the Paul Dietrich character (Dreyfuss) to be a bit stuffy and dramatically frustrating. The back story explained much of his uptight behavior at the competition, but that childish display of sour grapes following Heidi Joan Schoonover's performance of the Prokofieff Third Concerto turned me against him for good. Well, at least he was not stereotypical, and Dreyfuss certainly did not ""phone in"" his riveting performance. As for Amy Irving as Heidi, I could not keep my eyes off her pretty screen presence, and she filled her character with genuine human emotion. I did not find Lee Remick's role to be very convincing. Not for a minute did I buy into the idea that she was a former concert pianist who has become a hard-nosed, crack-the-whip teacher.

Richard Dreyfus &amp; Amy Irving are young pianists who fall in love while vying for the prize of a major competition.For the finale, Dreyfuss chooses Beethoven's piano concerto no.5, while Amy chooses the more complex Prokofiev's piano concerto no.3. Though Amy Irving is more smitten by Dreyfuss's charm, he's a bit reluctant to get involved due to the competition which both parties want to win desperately.

It seems like most of the pianists I've talked to over the years have seen this and love to talk about it, especially the piano ""faking"", which is done so well, it actually fooled my piano teacher.  Unlike most other movies that show a well-known actor playing the piano from only the chest up, this one keeps the hands and body in full view during the crucial scenes, instead of cutting back and a forth to a close-up of a stand-in's hands.  Richard and Amy reportedly spent several months learning how to fake the moves required to make the piano playing look believable, and the results are astounding. The actual piano on the soundtrack was recorded by others, but you'd never know it just from watching the movie.  The story line is very touching and has many moments that ring true, especially the portrayal of what we have to give up for the sake of our art.This is the movie that I have watched over the years when I don't feel like practicing, or when I need to be inspired to keep pushing ahead at the keyboard.
