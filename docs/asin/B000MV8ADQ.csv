1051181,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B000MV8ADQ,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[9, 11]","Four years after Robin Gibb's Concert with the Frankfurt Philharmonic Orchestra, Robin returns performing from Denmark with the Danish National Concert Orchestra.  Without much fanfare, Robin and his band start right into, ""More Than A Woman"", bringing the audience into the excitement.  The songs continue with the typical Robin Gibb flair but there is not much new from the 2005 concert DVD, other than a few new songs.  Most notably is ""Alan Freeman Days"" which is probably the highlight of the concert.  ""Islands In The Stream"" is also a new live song and proves the audience is appreciative of its inclusion, but the spark is simply not there.  ""New York Mining Disaster 1941"" is also here, but in its original form and not as exciting a new interpretation that it was given on the previous DVD.  It is fortunate to hear Robins voice in the forefront and separated from the three excellent female back-up vocalists, but there is a question that begs answering.  Did Robin use computer altered singing in the final mix?  At times it does seem that his voice has that ""Glee"" style, but then again, Robin's vibrato has always been steady and unique.  I would have said there is none until I heard, ""Juliet"".  Its sounds just like he was singing a ""Glee"" song.  Even the percussionist looks at him several times as if he were out of tune.  No matter.  He still sends out a decent song, even if the audience doesn't sing along, as in other concerts.  One thing that is missing is the standard earphone or the classic Robin hand-clasp to the ear.  He does have five speakers that send his vocals directly back to him onstage, but is that enough?  It isn't until the final song that the uses his hand for sound balance.It should be noted that this concert is about one-half hour shorter than the previous DVD.  It also does not have as much of the earlier interpretations that the other DVD had, other than a few minor alternate song endings.  Also missing are the songs, ""Please"", ""Love Hurts"" and ""My Lover's Prayer"", all songs that added a unique atmosphere to a public audience of adoring fans.  It is interesting to hear ""You Should Be Dancing"" sung in a normal ranged voice and have it come off as a strong concert song, but ""Jive Talkin'"" lacks the funkiness of the original.The grounds and day concert atmosphere of the Ledreborg Castle are impressive with a large audience.  There is not a great deal of performer/audience interaction, but as a total entity, the concert works.  It's just a shame that there are no extras.  The biggest disappointment is that although the DVD claims to be in DTS Digital Surround Sound, it is only in stereo.  This is a technical item that is nearly unforgivable, particularly considering the expansive concert grounds and audience.",4,Bee Gees By Robin Gibb,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,2772,"['Four', 'years', 'Robin', 'Gibb', 'Concert', 'Frankfurt', 'Philharmonic', 'Orchestra', 'Robin', 'performing', 'Denmark', 'Danish', 'National', 'Concert', 'Orchestra', 'much', 'fanfare', 'Robin', 'band', 'start', 'right', 'More', 'Than', 'Woman', 'bringing', 'audience', 'excitement', 'songs', 'continue', 'typical', 'Robin', 'Gibb', 'flair', 'not', 'much', 'new', '2005', 'concert', 'DVD', 'other', 'few', 'new', 'songs', 'Most', 'notably', 'Alan', 'Freeman', 'Days', 'probably', 'highlight', 'concert', 'Stream', 'also', 'new', 'live', 'song', 'audience', 'appreciative', 'inclusion', 'spark', 'simply', 'not', 'there', 'New', 'York', 'Mining', 'Disaster', '1941', 'also', 'here', 'original', 'form', 'not', 'exciting', 'new', 'interpretation', 'was', 'given', 'previous', 'DVD', 'fortunate', 'hear', 'Robins', 'voice', 'forefront', 'separated', 'three', 'excellent', 'female', 'back-up', 'vocalists', 'question', 'answering', 'Did', 'Robin', 'use', 'computer', 'altered', 'singing', 'final', 'mix', 'times', 'seem', 'voice', 'Glee', 'style', 'then', 'again', 'Robin', 'vibrato', 'always', 'been', 'steady', 'unique', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'none', 'heard', 'Juliet', 'sounds', 'just', 'was', 'singing', 'Glee', 'song', 'Even', 'percussionist', 'several', 'times', 'were', 'out', 'tune', 'matter', 'still', 'out', 'decent', 'song', 'even', 'audience', ""n't"", 'sing', 'along', 'other', 'concerts', 'One', 'thing', 'missing', 'standard', 'earphone', 'classic', 'Robin', 'hand-clasp', 'ear', 'have', 'five', 'speakers', 'send', 'vocals', 'directly', 'back', 'onstage', 'enough', ""n't"", 'final', 'song', 'uses', 'hand', 'sound', 'balance.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'concert', 'one-half', 'hour', 'shorter', 'previous', 'DVD', 'also', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'earlier', 'interpretations', 'other', 'DVD', 'had', 'other', 'few', 'minor', 'alternate', 'song', 'endings', 'Also', 'missing', 'are', 'songs', 'Please', 'Love', 'Hurts', 'Lover', 'Prayer', 'songs', 'added', 'unique', 'atmosphere', 'public', 'audience', 'adoring', 'fans', 'interesting', 'hear', 'Should', 'Be', 'Dancing', 'sung', 'normal', 'ranged', 'voice', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'strong', 'concert', 'song', 'Jive', 'Talkin', 'funkiness', 'original.The', 'grounds', 'day', 'concert', 'atmosphere', 'Ledreborg', 'Castle', 'are', 'impressive', 'large', 'audience', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'performer/audience', 'interaction', 'total', 'entity', 'concert', 'just', 'shame', 'are', 'extras', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'claims', 'be', 'DTS', 'Digital', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'only', 'stereo', 'technical', 'item', 'nearly', 'unforgivable', 'particularly', 'considering', 'expansive', 'concert', 'grounds', 'audience']",Rock N Roll Legends - Bobby Vee

1051185,A81P47EIXM8HA,B000MV8ADQ,"Richardson ""Clarence""","[3, 11]","I felt obliged to write an honest review of this program.  Firstly, my Bee Gees credentials include traveling to Las Vegas for the One Night Only show which is so well captured on DVD and HIGHLY recommendedBee Gees: One Night Only (Anniversary Edition).  This is bad on so many levels... the best thing about it is that its barely an hour so the pain it is sure to induce is quick. Robin was an essential element in the Bee Gees not only as a songwriter but his voice was a wonderful ""color"" to offset main man Barry and his more normal sounding twin Maurice. Robins quavering voice was always the perfect foil.  The problem is his voice is too iconic and when performing It is obvious he should stick to his solo repertoire. I don't care how many musicians he gets on stage with him or how many scantily clad women back up singers they surround him with .... it only amplifies the fact that he isn't Barry and when he sings Barry's parts it sucks.. and to a ridiculous level. If you want nostalgia buy a Bee Gees DVD , If you want to buy this because you love Robin and Maurice and Barry (the reason I bought it and his equally terrible alternate DVDRobin Gibb with the Frankfurt Neue Philharmonic Orchestra - Live)I understand, as I said I support Robin and spent 10 bucks on this to keep my Bee Gees collection complete.But Please don't rave about the performance, Its odd at best, poor in many places, uncomfortable most of the time and musically a mess.",1,stop the insanity!!  this stinks!,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,1458,"['felt', 'obliged', 'write', 'honest', 'review', 'program', 'Firstly', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'credentials', 'include', 'traveling', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'One', 'Night', 'Only', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'captured', 'DVD', 'HIGHLY', 'recommendedBee', 'Gees', 'One', 'Night', 'Only', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'bad', 'many', 'levels', 'best', 'thing', 'barely', 'hour', 'pain', 'sure', 'induce', 'quick', 'Robin', 'was', 'essential', 'element', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'not', 'only', 'songwriter', 'voice', 'was', 'wonderful', 'color', 'offset', 'main', 'man', 'Barry', 'more', 'normal', 'sounding', 'twin', 'Maurice', 'Robins', 'quavering', 'voice', 'was', 'always', 'perfect', 'foil', 'problem', 'voice', 'too', 'iconic', 'when', 'performing', 'obvious', 'should', 'stick', 'solo', 'repertoire', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'many', 'musicians', 'stage', 'how', 'many', 'scantily', 'clad', 'women', 'back', 'singers', 'surround', 'only', 'fact', ""n't"", 'Barry', 'when', 'Barry', 'parts', 'sucks..', 'ridiculous', 'level', 'want', 'nostalgia', 'buy', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'DVD', 'want', 'buy', 'love', 'Robin', 'Maurice', 'Barry', 'reason', 'bought', 'equally', 'terrible', 'alternate', 'DVDRobin', 'Gibb', 'Frankfurt', 'Neue', 'Philharmonic', 'Orchestra', 'Live', 'understand', 'said', 'support', 'Robin', 'spent', '10', 'bucks', 'keep', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'collection', 'complete.But', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'rave', 'performance', 'odd', 'best', 'poor', 'many', 'places', 'uncomfortable', 'most', 'time', 'musically', 'mess']",Rock N Roll Legends - Bobby Vee
