I always enjoys a good romantic movie and this designed to be one.However the entire movie focused on finding and finishing the last chapter and the love between the author for his wife and the desire of the editor to see the book published.  The level of expectation was built so high that no ending could possibly live up to the internal fantasy that we all hoped for.The acting was somewhat bland and understated and through out the film there was a sense of missing something.  Having said all this, I loved the movie and continue to watch it however, I also enjoyed sheena.I would reccommend this to anyone to is a romantic, enjoy",3,Could be great.,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,762,"['storyline', 'was', 'great', 'Looking', 'last', 'chapter', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'years', 'earlier', 'had', 'fantastic', 'potential', 'always', 'good', 'romantic', 'movie', 'designed', 'be', 'entire', 'movie', 'focused', 'finding', 'finishing', 'last', 'chapter', 'love', 'author', 'wife', 'desire', 'editor', 'see', 'book', 'published', 'level', 'expectation', 'was', 'built', 'so', 'high', 'ending', 'could', 'possibly', 'live', 'up', 'internal', 'fantasy', 'hoped', 'for.The', 'acting', 'was', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'understated', 'film', 'was', 'sense', 'missing', 'something', 'Having', 'said', 'loved', 'movie', 'continue', 'watch', 'however', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'sheena.I', 'would', 'reccommend', 'anyone', 'romantic', 'enjoy']",N/A

I caught this little gem accidentally while channel surfing and was instantly hooked.  I was fascinated by the plot, unfolding story, and intimacy of the tale; the only other time I experienced something similar was when I stumbled upon ""The High Line.""  Good entertainment! Dushku?  Eye candy?  She rocks?  Not in this movie.

875452,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0006Z2LE2,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[1, 2]","The Kiss is wonderful romantic film about long lost true love, and the courage to realize where the heart belongs in order to return to love. In this relatively low-budget and sincere film, featured some good actors in supporting roles include Terence Stamp, Billy Zane, Eliza Dushku, Illleana Douglas, while Francoise Surel anchored the story in a dual roles.Cara(Francoise Surel) is a book editor, and she's been assigned by her boss Joyce(Illeana Douglas) to track down the author(Phillip Naudet/Terence Stamp) of The Kiss, a 20 year old manuscript that's missing the ending. The Kiss is expected to become a bestseller if published, and she has one week before the deadline. She was fascinated and touched by the unfinished book, because her own love life during her early twenties is very similar to Claire's in The Kiss. They both were afraid of serious commitment and vanished from their boyfriends, only to learn that they regretted their choices a decade later. Billy Zane played Cara's rejected boyfriend Alan as well as Claire's(also played by Surel) boyfriend Young Phillip in the book, which took place in Paris during the '50s. The scenes imagined from the book is shot in black and white, and the Francoise Surel looks very different in a vintage look.Cara and her roomate Megan(Eliza Dushku) embarked a search for Phillip, but he's been hidding away from the world in a remote town, so it took Cara a long time to track him down. Phillip Naudet was broken hearted and dying of cancer since his wife past away, and he was reluctant to help Cara with finishing his book that was based on his own love life.....Francoise Surel and Billy Zane shared some touching and romantic moments together. Terence Stamp did a pretty good job with his limited screen time and a decent American accent. Illeana Douglas and Eliza Dushku had minimal screentime and seemed wasted for their insigificant roles.",4,The Return of True Love.,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,1905,"['Kiss', 'wonderful', 'romantic', 'film', 'long', 'lost', 'true', 'love', 'courage', 'realize', 'where', 'heart', 'order', 'return', 'love', 'relatively', 'low-budget', 'sincere', 'film', 'featured', 'good', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'include', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Illleana', 'Douglas', 'Francoise', 'Surel', 'anchored', 'story', 'dual', 'roles.Cara', 'Francoise', 'Surel', 'book', 'editor', 'been', 'assigned', 'boss', 'Joyce', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'track', 'down', 'author', 'Phillip', 'Naudet/Terence', 'Stamp', 'Kiss', '20', 'year', 'old', 'manuscript', 'missing', 'ending', 'Kiss', 'expected', 'become', 'bestseller', 'published', 'one', 'week', 'deadline', 'was', 'fascinated', 'touched', 'unfinished', 'book', 'own', 'love', 'life', 'early', 'twenties', 'very', 'similar', 'Claire', 'Kiss', 'were', 'afraid', 'serious', 'commitment', 'vanished', 'boyfriends', 'only', 'learn', 'regretted', 'choices', 'decade', 'later', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'played', 'Cara', 'rejected', 'boyfriend', 'Alan', 'as', 'well', 'Claire', 'also', 'played', 'Surel', 'boyfriend', 'Young', 'Phillip', 'book', 'took', 'place', 'Paris', ""'50s"", 'scenes', 'imagined', 'book', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'Francoise', 'Surel', 'very', 'different', 'vintage', 'look.Cara', 'roomate', 'Megan', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'embarked', 'search', 'Phillip', 'been', 'hidding', 'away', 'world', 'remote', 'town', 'took', 'Cara', 'long', 'time', 'track', 'down', 'Phillip', 'Naudet', 'was', 'broken', 'hearted', 'dying', 'cancer', 'wife', 'away', 'was', 'reluctant', 'help', 'Cara', 'finishing', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'own', 'love', 'life', '..Francoise', 'Surel', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'shared', 'touching', 'romantic', 'moments', 'together', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'decent', 'American', 'accent', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'had', 'minimal', 'screentime', 'seemed', 'wasted', 'insigificant', 'roles']",N/A
