Of course, if you are an activist, you would enjoy the nuances and humor more.I am dismayed by some of the negative reviews.  I did not see her character as being ""negative"" at all.  She was lost and looking for purpose and probably a bit lonely, too but she has a huge heart.  I found her to be very lovable and endearing. She is just part of the human condition.I left having a warm feeling in my heart.  How great to have a movie made about a real person who has feelings...not some hyped up Glamour woman.  I liked how the focus of the movie was not about the outsides of this woman's life but her insides...which made it all the more interesting.

1084507,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000RZIGW2,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[11, 20]","You have to be more than an animal lover to like `Year of the Dog'.  I am an animal lover, and I especially  like dogs.  This film begins with great promise.  Starting out as a human tale about a lonely woman, Peggy Spade (Molly Shannon who plays the role with vulnerable sweetness) whose life revolves around her dog, Pencil, we get more than we bargain for.  When Pencil dies she is heartbroken.  From here the story takes on some didactic qualities.  Meeting with her next door neighbor (John C. Reilly), a gun-toting, hunter who takes an interest in Peggy, we follow an investigation that leads to suspicious clues regarding Pencil's death.Helping her during her grieving is fellow worker at her pedestrian, secretarial job, Layla (Regina King) who tirelessly tries to cheer her up and get her dating again.  (""How are you going to find a guy if you're shacking up with dogs?""). Then there's an animal shelter coordinator (played with proper effervescence by Peter Sarsgaard) who speaks for how most of us feel, ""Dogs are like us.  They live for love.""  When she adopts another dog, she finds out more about the shelter.  Digging deeper, she sees that he compromises on the job, and then comes across some less-than-animal-friendly dirt from her own employer.  Supplementing her interests are her niece and nephew, whom she baby-sits for her sister, (played likeably enough by a protective Laura Dern).  The movie then takes a step-by-step educational tour into the world and reasoning of PETA.To evaluate the movie, one has to step back and separate the film from the values.  I have to ask what is good or bad about the movie.  This movie sports the PETA beliefs about animals.  While I don't entirely agree with their beliefs, that's not the point, really.  I believe in humane treatment for animals, and I think nature is a great gift, one that renews and restores us.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I respect others who do believe in vegan diets and practice what they preach to help animals.  I was thinking that maybe PETA had funded this movie, but so far my investigation indicates it has not.Putting myself in someone else's shoes, I think this movie fails at its attempts to teach and convert to the PETA cause.  When Peggy takes liberties with the children during an overnighter with her sister's children, she has her niece almost traumatized by her ""field trip"" mission.  And, later, when she takes liberties with her employer's time and resources, it hardly gains our sympathy.  Even some of her domestic moves, make us take partial sympathy in ways we're not supposed to with her villain neighbor.  (Speaking of antagonists, Reilly's character is well rounded enough, to their credit, from preventing him becoming anything more than an inconsiderate slob, rather than a cardboard villain with fangs.  Her boss is the real jerk, but admirably, they keep him real as well.)  Furthermore, suspended disbelief is stretched with much of the resolution.  (Her colleagues in one scene shower her with an offer almost no one could refuse.)  Then there's Regina who is unflappable with her overtures to Peggy who almost always brushes her off.  (How many friends would be that persistent?)The problem isn't with the acting, which is so genuine and heartfelt to match the cause, and the warmth of the human comedy isn't a mismatch.  The comedy is filled with wit and charm--even if the previews give most of it away.  It's not even with the premise.  It's where they go with the story.  Having such a sweet and sensitive character as the protagonist, the resolution fails to keep our sympathies with her and her cause.  At the beginning, they had me grieving, too, for I could put myself in Peggy's shoes.  From there they lost me along the way.  If PETA had financed the movie, putting myself in their shoes, I would have asked for my money back.",2,A Time of Incredulity,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,3853,"['have', 'be', 'more', 'animal', 'lover', 'like', 'Year', 'Dog', 'am', 'animal', 'lover', 'especially', 'dogs', 'film', 'great', 'promise', 'Starting', 'out', 'human', 'tale', 'lonely', 'woman', 'Peggy', 'Spade', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'who', 'role', 'vulnerable', 'sweetness', 'life', 'dog', 'Pencil', 'get', 'more', 'bargain', 'When', 'Pencil', 'heartbroken', 'here', 'story', 'didactic', 'qualities', 'Meeting', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'gun-toting', 'hunter', 'who', 'interest', 'Peggy', 'follow', 'investigation', 'suspicious', 'clues', 'regarding', 'Pencil', 'death.Helping', 'grieving', 'fellow', 'worker', 'pedestrian', 'secretarial', 'job', 'Layla', 'Regina', 'King', 'who', 'tirelessly', 'cheer', 'up', 'get', 'dating', 'again', 'How', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'guy', ""'re"", 'shacking', 'up', 'dogs', 'Then', 'animal', 'shelter', 'coordinator', 'played', 'proper', 'effervescence', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'how', 'most', 'feel', 'Dogs', 'are', 'live', 'love', 'When', 'dog', 'out', 'more', 'shelter', 'Digging', 'deeper', 'job', 'then', 'less-than-animal-friendly', 'dirt', 'own', 'employer', 'Supplementing', 'interests', 'are', 'niece', 'nephew', 'whom', 'sister', 'played', 'likeably', 'enough', 'protective', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'movie', 'then', 'step-by-step', 'educational', 'tour', 'world', 'reasoning', 'PETA.To', 'evaluate', 'movie', 'one', 'step', 'back', 'separate', 'film', 'values', 'have', 'ask', 'what', 'good', 'bad', 'movie', 'movie', 'sports', 'PETA', 'beliefs', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'agree', 'beliefs', 'not', 'point', 'really', 'believe', 'humane', 'treatment', 'animals', 'think', 'nature', 'great', 'gift', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'vegetarian', 'respect', 'others', 'who', 'do', 'believe', 'vegan', 'diets', 'practice', 'what', 'preach', 'help', 'animals', 'was', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'PETA', 'had', 'funded', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'investigation', 'not.Putting', 'someone', 'else', 'shoes', 'think', 'movie', 'attempts', 'teach', 'convert', 'PETA', 'cause', 'When', 'Peggy', 'liberties', 'children', 'overnighter', 'sister', 'children', 'niece', 'almost', 'traumatized', 'field', 'trip', 'mission', 'later', 'when', 'liberties', 'employer', 'time', 'resources', 'hardly', 'gains', 'sympathy', 'Even', 'domestic', 'moves', 'make', 'take', 'partial', 'sympathy', 'ways', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'villain', 'neighbor', 'Speaking', 'antagonists', 'Reilly', 'character', 'well', 'rounded', 'enough', 'credit', 'preventing', 'becoming', 'anything', 'more', 'inconsiderate', 'slob', 'rather', 'cardboard', 'villain', 'fangs', 'boss', 'real', 'jerk', 'admirably', 'keep', 'real', 'as', 'well', 'Furthermore', 'suspended', 'disbelief', 'stretched', 'much', 'resolution', 'colleagues', 'one', 'scene', 'offer', 'almost', 'one', 'could', 'refuse', 'Then', 'Regina', 'who', 'unflappable', 'overtures', 'Peggy', 'who', 'almost', 'always', 'off', 'How', 'many', 'friends', 'would', 'be', 'persistent', 'problem', ""n't"", 'acting', 'so', 'genuine', 'heartfelt', 'match', 'cause', 'warmth', 'human', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'mismatch', 'comedy', 'filled', 'wit', 'charm', 'even', 'previews', 'give', 'most', 'away', 'not', 'even', 'premise', 'where', 'go', 'story', 'Having', 'such', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'character', 'protagonist', 'resolution', 'keep', 'sympathies', 'cause', 'beginning', 'had', 'grieving', 'too', 'could', 'put', 'Peggy', 'shoes', 'lost', 'way', 'PETA', 'had', 'financed', 'movie', 'putting', 'shoes', 'would', 'have', 'asked', 'money', 'back']",N/A

1084510,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000RZIGW2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I remember when this little movie first came out and raves were circulating about Molly Shannon and her dynamic performance.  I remember thinking that it must be a joke, a fluke review by some strange SNL fan.  And then I read another review singling this particular performance out as one of the best of the year.  Okay; another fluke?  Not so fast, for next thing I knew I was reading review upon review of this little film with a big heart and a brilliant dramatic performance by one of the most outrageous comedic talents of our time (I say outrageous to mean not necessarily a good thing, since she is an acquired taste).Even with all that, the reason I finally sat down to watch this film was because I absolutely adore Peter Sarsgaard, worship the ground that John C. Reilly acts on and Laura Dern's career is one that intrigues me and I really want to see more of her.Regina King was total bonus points (I had no idea she was in this, but yeah for me because she is awesome).So with such a stellar cast, I was beginning to get really excited as the opening credits continued to role and I was kicking myself for waiting so long to actually get down to watching this `black comedy'.  Yes, it is dramatic but it has a sense of humor, a dry and realistic sense of humor that gives the film a little edge.So, was the movie as good as I was led to believe?Almost.Truly, this is a delightful film and it has a pure message of humanity that runs throughout it.  I was blown away by the way it actually made me think; and I wasn't really expecting anything profound to come out of this film.  The film tells us of Peggy, a single middle-aged woman who has bonded ever so closely to her young dog Pencil.  She has a very hard time interacting with other humans, but her passion for animals knows no boundaries.  When Pencil is accidentally poisoned and killed Peggy goes through a very intense mourning process that forces her to make relationships with a few different people; her brother and her sister-in-law; a workmate; her neighbor and a fellow dog lover.  Through these interactions she finds herself in a way that is both bizarre yet oddly fulfilling.The acting is all top notch here, especially from Shannon who really needs to grace this territory more often.  Her poignant delivery is chilling at times, but that adds to her character mental breakdown.  John C. Reilly is always amazing, and here he builds on that character he does so well.  Peter Sarsgaard is slowly becoming one of my favorite actors (Oscar, please grant him your glory soon) and this is just further proof that he really should be in EVERY movie.  Regina King is a delightful mess as always and Laura Dern is calm and rigid and completely commanding.My only complaint is the ending, which as I said is bizarre and oddly fulfilling.  It is just not wholly fulfilling.  It was that one point that fit yet didn't seem to fit, if that makes any sense.  I can't hate it, and I understand it, but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  I thought for sure that this film was going in a different direction.  It's not a bad thing, and it is not something that everyone will have an issue with.Regardless of the ending though, or your thoughts on it I should say, the film is still very satisfying.  Great performances, truthful scripting and very thought provoking delivery make for a very unique and intriguing film experience.",4,A powerful tale of loss in the most unexpected of places...,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,3396,"['remember', 'when', 'little', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'raves', 'were', 'circulating', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'remember', 'thinking', 'must', 'be', 'joke', 'fluke', 'review', 'strange', 'SNL', 'fan', 'then', 'read', 'review', 'singling', 'particular', 'performance', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'Okay', 'fluke', 'Not', 'fast', 'next', 'thing', 'knew', 'was', 'reading', 'review', 'review', 'little', 'film', 'big', 'heart', 'brilliant', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'outrageous', 'comedic', 'talents', 'time', 'say', 'outrageous', 'mean', 'not', 'necessarily', 'good', 'thing', 'acquired', 'taste', 'reason', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'worship', 'ground', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'career', 'one', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'her.Regina', 'King', 'was', 'total', 'bonus', 'points', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'yeah', 'awesome', '.So', 'stellar', 'cast', 'was', 'beginning', 'get', 'really', 'excited', 'opening', 'credits', 'continued', 'role', 'was', 'kicking', 'waiting', 'so', 'long', 'actually', 'get', 'down', 'watching', 'black', 'comedy', 'Yes', 'dramatic', 'sense', 'humor', 'dry', 'realistic', 'sense', 'humor', 'film', 'little', 'edge.So', 'was', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'Almost.Truly', 'delightful', 'film', 'pure', 'message', 'humanity', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'way', 'actually', 'made', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'anything', 'profound', 'come', 'film', 'film', 'Peggy', 'single', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'who', 'bonded', 'ever', 'so', 'closely', 'young', 'dog', 'Pencil', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'interacting', 'other', 'humans', 'passion', 'animals', 'boundaries', 'When', 'Pencil', 'accidentally', 'poisoned', 'killed', 'Peggy', 'very', 'intense', 'mourning', 'process', 'make', 'relationships', 'few', 'different', 'people', 'brother', 'sister-in-law', 'workmate', 'neighbor', 'fellow', 'dog', 'lover', 'interactions', 'way', 'bizarre', 'yet', 'oddly', 'fulfilling.The', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'here', 'especially', 'Shannon', 'who', 'really', 'grace', 'territory', 'more', 'often', 'poignant', 'delivery', 'chilling', 'times', 'character', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'always', 'amazing', 'here', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Oscar', 'please', 'grant', 'glory', 'soon', 'just', 'further', 'proof', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'EVERY', 'movie', 'Regina', 'King', 'delightful', 'mess', 'always', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'calm', 'rigid', 'completely', 'only', 'complaint', 'ending', 'said', 'bizarre', 'oddly', 'fulfilling', 'just', 'not', 'wholly', 'fulfilling', 'was', 'one', 'point', 'fit', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'understand', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'thought', 'sure', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'different', 'direction', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'not', 'something', 'everyone', 'will', 'have', 'issue', 'with.Regardless', 'ending', 'thoughts', 'should', 'say', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'satisfying', 'Great', 'performances', 'truthful', 'scripting', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'delivery', 'make', 'very', 'unique', 'intriguing', 'film', 'experience']",N/A

It has everything going against it:1. It's boring. I fell asleep halfway through and didn't bother to return to the last scene I watched. I didn't care. Molly Shannon's delivery is mopey, disinterested, and bland. Everyone speaks their lines like they're in a library, in hushed tones. Excruciating.2. It's not funny. The trailers would have you believe this is some sort of comedy. However it is not. It is a tragic drama with some mirthless joketelling. It is not funny to observe a woman who is so disconnected from human beings that she relates only to animals. I found the Molly Shannon character so pathetic and grating that I could not symapthize nor empathize with her.Also, to have so many scenes with people blubbering over the deaths of their pets is just plain sad. I thought I was going to watch a comedy and then I'm watching people crying every ten minutes. I was moved at first, but then it just became maudlin.3. Terrible direction. How many close-ups of actor's faces do we need in a movie? Ten? Twenty? How about a couple hundred? Is a close-up shot of a face supposed to be used for some kind of dramatic effect, or is it simply a stylistic approach to filmmaking? I'm no film school grad, but the culmutive effect of staring at close-ups of the actor's faces throughout the movie was jarring, uninteresting, and in my opinion, lazy. These close-ups were not even reaction shots, just a way to film a character talking, or listening, or just gaping. I'm sure the director's purpose was to be whimsical, but he failed. Instead he achieved annoyance.4. Pointless. In the end, Molly Shannon becomes an extreme animal activist. So?

E Jackson,"[1, 3]","Year of the Dog is a nice little family story about a woman who lives alone, doesn't particularly like her job, has a couple so-called friends she communicates with at work, and has a neighbor she ends up disliking.  What was I believe her brother and his wife constantly walking around with a full of crap attitude, which was a bit funny compared to Molly Shannon's shy, but well-meaning personality.Anyway, I didn't even get to the point of the movie did I?  Molly's character has an obsession with dogs that eventually spins out of control.  She ends up hating her neighbor once she finds out how her dog was poisoned, and another interesting thing about the movie was Molly's boss, who comes across like a depressing jerk most of the time.Another important part of the story was one of Molly's friends constantly trying to hook her up with a man, but the relationships never quite work out.  Molly tries to meet a guy but that doesn't work out either thanks to... well, I never quite understood his reasoning, haha.Molly's character eventually tries convincing her own family not to eat any meat because meat comes from animals, and it rubs people the wrong way, but the great thing about the movie is how there's a bunch of subtle little jokes while the storyline is taking place that you have to pay close attention to notice.

This is black comedy, where the absurd dominates, and endings are bittersweet, at best.Writer/director Mike White has a keen eye for both sides of the 'animal rights' issue, and succeeds in both sympathizing with and lampooning activists, through Shannon. A 40-something single career woman, Shannon aches for the love life she never had, devoting herself to her beloved dog, instead. When the dog is accidentally poisoned, she is thrust into a strange new world of less-than-satisfactory men (redneck neighbor John C. Reilly, and effeminate dog trainer Peter Sarsgaard), her overprotective and materialistic family (Thomas McCarthey and Laura Dern), and a world of animals desperately needing love and protection. In finding a new direction for her life, she goes WAY off the deep end, and while she ultimately follows her heart, the journey isn't the kind of 'by-the-numbers' formula viewers expecting romance would expect.Shannon is remarkable, capturing both her character's humor and pain, and shows promise for a future of more dramatic roles.

1084517,A1OO7OYL4XMA5F,B000RZIGW2,"C. Harmon ""animal lover""","[15, 24]","I am an ardent animal lover and also a 58 year old single woman.  I have three dogs, one horse and three cats.  Over the years, I have spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on the health and well being of my four legged friends.  I have held dogs in my arms as the veterinarian gently gave them peace from illness or old age.  In the summer of 2005, I stroked the dear face of a beautiful, angelic Arabian horse as the vet gave her the same peace.  She was 26 years old and she had been with me since she ws 2 years old.  The only horse I have now is her 12 year old son who will be with me always.  I KNOW the grief of losing a beloved pet.I say this so viewers will know my passion for animals.  This movie SO dissapointed me.  I can't say everything I feel without writing a review that would rival 'War and Peace' in length.  So I'll try to make it as concise as possible.As much as I detest the sport of hunting animals, Pencil's death ws caused by Peggy's (MOlly Shannon) irresponsibility, not what was stored in the garage of her neighbor, who happened to BE a hunter.  She blamed him, broke into his house and attacked him, which only made her look psychotic, not grief stricken.When I have lost pets, the folks I know have been loving and supportive.  Maybe they did not fully understand the depth of my loss, but they certainly were not shallow like Peggy's friends and family.  Was this supposed to offer comic relief or something?  There is nothing comical about losing a pet.  And while Peggy did not get the understanding she craved, neither did she offer much sympathy to Newton when her new dog killed his little disabled Corgi.  Ws this because, earlier in the film, he had not responded to her sexually?Losing a pet and/or being single does not cause a person to bring home 10 dogs from the shelter at one time--dogs that they are totally unprepared to care for.  And it does not cause them to lose all sense of responsibility and let the dogs urinate and defecate in the house, tear up the furniture and do nothing about it but lounge around dreamily in the bed and talk about how they are surrounded by love.  Again, psychotic comes to mind.losing a pet would not cause a sane person to forge her boss's name on a check and send it to any charitable organization, human or animal.Pets are not a replacement for human relationships which is the direction this movie seems headed.  Pets cannot replace humans and neither can humans replace pets.  Animals offer us love that we KNOW is unconditional. We always wonder if there are conditions on the love offered by other humans even if there are none.  Our pets let us know without a doubt that we are the most important and beloved things in their world.I don't know what this movie was supposed to be--I thought from the previews that it was a comedy.  I found 2 things amusing--the dog's name. Who ever heard of a dog named Pencil?  And the fact that Peggy kept saying that Pencil died of TOXIC POISONING.  I mean, really, is there any other kind of poisoning?i have no idea what the director was trying to say but I feel that he failed miserably to say anything of value.  I am hoping that my Amazon friend, Jenny, (New Yorker who lives in Florida), can tell me what this movie is.  She's more generous than me with her critiques of most movies.As for me, this movie makes animal lovers and single people, as well, look pathetic and somewhat psychotic.

1084519,A2FBUVV2CU2PVR,B000RZIGW2,D. A. Yurkovich,"[10, 17]","Watched the DVD after seeing the trailer (which spun the film as a light-hearted comedic love story with dogs) but the film is anything but light or comedic. Poor Peggy. She cannot get a break. Life has dumped upon her time after time, but in many ways she alone is totally responsible for these dumpings.1. Her dog Pencil is killed by eating something toxic one morning. Peggy blames her neighbor, saying that if her neighbor's garage door hadn't been left open then Pencil would not have gone into the garage, eaten toxins, and died. Peggy, if you are concerned about your dog, keep an eye on your dog. As a dog owner I can tell you that a dog does not know not to eat poisons and other things that will cause illness or death. It's up to us to keep our critters safe. I also found it unrealistic that Peggy would just box up all of Pencils sweaters, toys, and photos. Sweaters and toys, yes, but photos? Is this how we remember our loved ones? By packing away even our photo memories? ""Well, now that grandma's dead, I guess we'll be putting her photos in a box.""2. Peggy becomes consumed with animal activism. Yes, it's easy to let this happen, but responsible adults do not go the extremes that Peggy goes to. At one point she rescues 15 dogs on their way to the gas chamber. But what happens? She is unable to care for these critters, and one day the city takes them away from her. She makes a hasty phone call and threatens legal action, but the plot point dies. We have no idea if these critters lived or died. They were mere puppets for Peggy to play God with, and it turns out she's not a very benevolent God.3. Peggy cannot get a man to be interested in her. She should by now (she's in her 40s here) realize that dating is really difficult, and she is by no means a very interesting character. Well, perhaps she is, but we're really never shown much more than snippets of her life.4. Peggy becomes an ultra-extreme vegan and begins to forge checks and send them to animal activist organizations. She attacks a neighbor at knifepoint because he is a hunter and she wants to show this man what it's like to know fear. Yawn. She tries to convert her young niece by taking her to a chicken slaughterhouse (though in the end she even chickens out of this cause). She goes about many, many tasks but does each one in the wrong way and for the wrong reason. What she should have done was seen a grief counselor and gotten some serious therapy, and then eventually (maybe) gotten another pet to honor the memory of Pencil. Instead, she gets no counseling, quickly gets another dog (a troubled German shepard that later attacks and kills a cripple dog and is then destroyed).5. None of the cast members are remotely likeable. Even Laura Dern's character is just unwatchable, and it's difficult watching Laura outdo everyone else's performance. Each character has quirks but none of the quirks are interesting. Peggy's boss is unfunny and looks constipated. Everyone is a stereotype of some sort (eg, the girlfriend who can't get her guy to commit, the workaholic boss who is unsympathetic to Peggy's budding animal activism, the family members who think she's just weird for going vegan).I kept waiting for something GOOD to come out of this film, for Peggy's character to hit an all-time low and then bounce back (because that's what's SUPPOSED to happen in a good screenplay), but in the end Peggy completely loses touch with reality. She quits her job and joins up with other activists. There's nothing wrong with activism, but this film portrays it as an all-or-nothing venture. I freakin' love critters. I'm active with animal rights groups, I have 3 pets (2 cats and a dog) and often babysit as many as 8 pets (including dogs, cats, and chickens), I don't eat animals, I catch and release spiders and other insects that find their way into the house (thus sparing them from the whims of the cats), I've rescued strays, and I either confront or report people to the SPCA if I see them abusing an animal. And I still have a life and work a full-time job and a part-time job. Why couldn't Peggy be actively involved in animal rights causes on the weekends or weeknights? Why couldn't she volunteer at a shelter? Why couldn't she go back to school and become a veternarian? Why couldn't she teach classes to educate others about animal spading and neutering to help reduce the number of animals killed in shelters? Instead we get a tacky, unrealistic climax in which Peggy (after being fired from work and subsequently rehired) returns to her office job for a few hours then decides to quit and become a full-time activist...except now she has no income to pay for her expensive vegan diet. And she also has no pet. And if Peggy is so damn concerned about animals, then why didn't she join other causes, such as environmental groups? Animals have to breathe the air too.This movie was a total dog. It even made SPIDER-MAN 3 look good by comparison.

He's in similar waters here detailing what happens when a woman who always says ""yes"" to everyone suddenly starts saying ""no.""  Molly Shannon, never better, is a dog-lover who becomes much, much more than that--dog-idolizer? Dog savior?  ANIMAL savior?  Who knows?  Unafraid to use her wide, wide smile to go from endearing to just a little frightening, it's a fearless performance. (The ending, in its beautiful ambiguity, reminds me a little of ""Up the Sandbox."") Things get bumpy in the last half hour (when, at a key point, Shannon intones, ""I'm so happy,"" you may seriously question her sanity), but of all the films I've seen this year, this one keeps lingering in the mind for reasons I can't quite pinpoint.  Largely, it's due to Shannon's brave work, but there's also stellar support from Laura Dern (dripping condescension with every syllable) and a sexually ambiguous Peter Sarsgaard (never warmer or more endearing onscreen).  A definite A-lister for animal lovers, and for fans of movies about women discovering themselves (it may also remind viewers of ""I've Heard the Mermaids Singing""--and that's high praise).",4,A great turn from Shannon elevates this quirky film,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,1298,"['Mike', 'White', 'done', 'amazing', 'stuff', 'School', 'Rock', 'most', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'ambitious', 'near-misses', 'Good', 'Girl', 'ending', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'similar', 'waters', 'here', 'detailing', 'what', 'when', 'woman', 'who', 'always', 'yes', 'everyone', 'suddenly', 'saying', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'never', 'better', 'dog-lover', 'who', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'dog-idolizer', 'Dog', 'savior', 'ANIMAL', 'savior', 'Who', 'Unafraid', 'use', 'wide', 'wide', 'smile', 'go', 'endearing', 'just', 'little', 'frightening', 'fearless', 'performance', 'ending', 'beautiful', 'ambiguity', 'little', 'Sandbox', 'Things', 'get', 'bumpy', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'when', 'key', 'point', 'Shannon', 'intones', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'may', 'seriously', 'question', 'sanity', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'one', 'lingering', 'mind', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pinpoint', 'Largely', 'due', 'Shannon', 'brave', 'work', 'also', 'stellar', 'support', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'dripping', 'condescension', 'syllable', 'sexually', 'ambiguous', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'never', 'warmer', 'more', 'endearing', 'onscreen', 'definite', 'A-lister', 'animal', 'lovers', 'fans', 'movies', 'women', 'discovering', 'may', 'also', 'remind', 'viewers', ""'ve"", 'Heard', 'Mermaids', 'Singing', 'high', 'praise']",N/A

People have disappointed her and she's okay with that, she loves her dog pencil. Pencil dies and Peggy's life moves outside its comfort zone. She dates, she volunteers, she adopts animals, she starts to get a backbone, she gets a little crazy.This movie had moments of funny, moments of discomfort, and a second viewing helps the message hit home. Each person that Peggy knows is obsessed with something. Peggy quietly smiles and listens to them jabber on about their loves, but few people really stop to listen to Peggy talk about her loves.I liked how even though Peggy began to stand up for herself she never stooped low enough to make fools of them. She came close, but she didn't cross that line, that's what gave her character so much credibility.I was oddly touched when the movie ended.

1084522,A2ZJ2H6DRSPVZ8,B000RZIGW2,Diane Stranz,"[0, 0]","Overall I liked this movie, but it was a close call and this movie deserves 3 1/2 stars instead of 4.  Let me list the negatives, then I'll state the reason (probably controversial) that I like the movie and find that it has value.  [SPOILER ALERT:  this review gives away many scenes in the movie -- so don't read further if you don't want to know.]One negative: the movie is not really a comedy.  Molly Shannon is known for her comedic acting -- so of course you pick up this movie thinking it is a comedy and cannot help being disappointed when you discover it is not.  Kind of like Steve Carrell's psychologist character in Hope Springs which left us wondering 'WTF?'  Why Carrell was cast for that character I'll never know.Second negative:  I was very disappointed when the scriptwriters had Molly Shannon's character go over the edge and act in ways which marked her as psychologically disturbed. Up until then I could empathize with her desire to find a passion to give her life meaning (animal activism) and to become bold enough to tell the soul-sucker losers in her life where they could get off. But forging her boss' signature to donate his money to animal rescue groups? No, no, no. Taking her niece to a poultry farm to forcibly impress upon her that commercially raised chickens are treated cruelly? No, no, no -- that was subtle child abuse. Breaking into her neighbor's house and planning to stab him with one of his hunting knives? Omg: when that happened I almost turned the movie off and quit watching.The 'reveal' that Shannon's character had actually been on a psychological precipice the entire time undercut all of the previous positive role-modeling, and seemed to imply that everyone who is self-effacing, kind, and genuinely caring is secretly a psychological time bomb waiting for the right mix of circumstances to implode and explode. And what is the resulting moral of the story if you believe that? That you might as well give yourself permission to be narcissistic and soul-sucking like those around you, because if you remain kind and self-effacing, not only will the narcissistic people trample you underfoot, but eventually the constant trampling will break you down and turn you into a mental case.  I.e., that being a soulless narcissist is an unfortunate, but necessary, compromise if you want to maintain sanity in this modern world of Western, consumeristic values.  YUCK! I'm not up with THAT as a philosophy of life!That said, I like movies to portray reality, and yes in reality many sensitive people get pushed over the edge of sanity by the insensitivity and callousness which pervades modern society.  So I cannot fault this film for presenting a story which could happen (and probably HAS happened.)  And this leads to the controversial reason I like this film:  although I believe in animal activism, we cannot overlook the fact that there are some people who are fanatics, take it too far, and, indeed, do not 'love animals' as much as they hate people, are psychologically damaged, and/or have some other undiagnosed inner void they are unconsciously seeking to fill.In my personal experience, when a human being begins to prefer the company of animals to the company of people, it is usually an indication of SOME sort of psychological impairment/damage.  For example, everyone thinks Ellen Degeneres is so wonderful, but on YouTube I stumbled across a speech she gave at a pro-Vegan, animal activist benefit:  she became so emotional in her ranting that she actually let her guard down and admitted that she HATES PEOPLE and wishes she could live in a world filled with nothing but pets.  Omg!  If I were to watch her talk show (which I generally do not) I would never again be able to take her seriously when she began to effuse about how much she 'loves' her next guest.  Psychiatrists know that unpremeditated slips like the ones Ellen made in that speech are often the only time people reveal the unmitigated truth about how they REALLY feel.And If that is how Ellen really feels, she is not a role model and ought not to be respected or admired by anyone, period. (Although, yes, she is still funny . . . though not as much these days as she used to be; witness the 2014 Oscar ceremony).I have had pets off and on throughout my life -- when my living situation is one in which having a pet will result in a positive experience for all concerned -- and if I choose to take responsibility for an animal, then I know I am making a lifetime commitment to care for the animal like part of my family.  But the pet is still an animal, and I believe that a mentally healthy individual will always place relationship with other human beings above relationships with animals.  To put it another way:  I do not think that bonds with pets are replacements for bonds with human beings, and bonds with other human beings are generally necessary to sustain mental health.  And if an animal mauled my hand when I tried to feed him, the animal would have to go -- either to an animal expert who understood the dangerous nature of the animal and still wanted to take it on for reform purposes, or to the vet for euthanasia. Period.  My life and the lives of those I live with matter more than the lives of animals, though yes I am quite fond of animals and get livid when they are mistreated.  All of life deserves to be treated with respect and compassion.So, after thinking about this movie for some time, I have to conclude that overall I like this movie because it portrays the reality that many people 'love animals' only because they are trying to find love in all the wrong places, and I think any story which sheds light on painful truths such as this one has value.  The Molly Shannon character doesn't appear to really 'love' dogs or why would she have let Pencil go out at night unsupervised (into her unfenced front yard where he could go ANYWHERE)? The dog is a relationship substitute for her, and in my personal experience of people who have pets when they really want a lover and/or a family, the moment the lover comes along, the pet is no longer important . . . which means the 'love' for the pet was an illusion and a self-deceit all along.For example, there was a single man (Gene) in our apartment complex several years ago who went on and on about his dog being his best friend, and the dog went everywhere with him.  Gene was always critical about how other people treated their pets and SEEMED to be an animal lover -- but then when he moved out, it was inconvenient for him to take his dog with him, so he abandoned it by leaving it tied to a pole here at the complex. None of us could believe Gene wasn't coming back for the dog, but eventually we had to acknowledge that as the reality and call animal services. Omg, it was such a horrific thing for my young sons to experience: such a sweet animal abandoned so callously, so indifferently.  A harsh life lesson that people are often not what they seem, or value in actuality what they vociferously CLAIM to value.Similarly, it was not convincing to me that Shannon's character automatically 'fell in love with' Valentine, the aggressive abused dog she adopted from Peter Sarsgaard's character.  It seemed obvious that because people had been such a disappointment, Shannon's character had so idealized pets as companions that her desire to acquire them had nothing, really, to do with genuine affection. It's somewhat like people who want a trophy spouse: acquisition of the spouse has some sort of validation status within the person's psyche which has nothing to do with 'love.'Peter Sarsgaard's character seems to 'love' animals for the same reason as Shannon's, which is why at first they genuinely connect:  somehow he has become psychologically impaired with respect to love and romantic relationships, so he has poured all of his urges towards connection into caring for dogs.  He states he could never put a dog to sleep, but then he simply RUSHES to do that to Valentine -- without permission from Valentine's owner! -- when the dog finally acts in a way consistent with his abuse-damaged nature.  I.e., Sarsgaard's character knew from the outset that Valentine was disturbed enough to maul other animals (or people) but he is so invested in his self-image as someone who does not kill animals that he cannot do the right thing when Valentine first comes into his possession (i.e., have Valentine put down.)  It is Sarsgaard's fault, not Valentine's, that Valentine ultimately kills another living being -- if it had been a child instead of a dog, Sarsgaard would likely have been prosecuted.Sarsgaard's character is as much of a mess -- if not more so -- than Shannon's character, but he doesn't do anything outrageous enough to alert society that he is psychologically impaired, so he continues to appear to the outside world as 'normal.'  (Though I would contend that psychological damage is so rampant in our society that to be damaged is, in fact, the 'new normal' and to be psychologically whole -- a truly individuated human being -- is to be the weirdo in the crowd.)So:  watch this if you want a thought-provoking movie, but skip it if you are looking for a light-hearted comedy.

1084524,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B000RZIGW2,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[5, 10]","A friend recommended this movie so I watched...and wished I hadn't.  Molly Shannon does a masterful job with the heroine's role, but she can't do much about the script. I can certainly understand the heroine ""Peggy's"" reaction when her beloved dog dies in a particularly cruel but accidental way. She would be guilt-ridden, too, because she let her dog out unsupervised - definitely a no-no, even if you have a yard.When your dog goes out at night, keep him on a leash.  You can't leave your dog alone in a suburban area, especially with unfenced yards. People do leave out poison - not deliberately, but because they see no need to dog-proof their yards and garages when they have no dogs. They also leave out garbage, which is perfectly innocent until it's eaten by a wandering dog.  My dog got sick just from salad dressing in my own home. Who knows what they'll find on their own?Already fragile, Peggy goes off the deep end. She gets found by ""Newt,"" a self-styled client services person who works with the Humane Society. But he's not too tightly wrapped either and he doesn't make good judgments about dogs. He offers Valentine - a tough German shepherd - to Peggy, who's clearly  not the right owner. Anyone can tell they're a mismatch. Anyway, who encourages someone to get a new dog on the rebound, while they're still experiencing grief?So Peggy now gets attached to a new dog who's all wrong for her - a dog with major behavior problems. She also becomes a crusader for animal rights, but not in a healthy way. German shepherds like Valentine need strong owners.  Anyone can see she's set up for more  heartbreak.Peggy is a doormat.  Her clothes and appearance scream, ""I don't matter. I've given up."" She brings donuts to her coworkers. She agrees to spend New Year's baby-sitting her sister's kids. She has no life, outside her dog. Her friend from work comes across as a shallow, self-centered woman who focuses on appearance -- including a strong desire for the appearance of being married. Yet Peggy somehow saves enough to live in a nice little house and support herself and her dog.The ending doesn't seem plausible and it's certainly not hopeful, although some reviewers describe it that way. I don't see the heroine transformed by her experience. She's just gotten crazier.This movie could be used as a training film on who should not adopt a dog and what are realistic standards for dog adoption and training. Peggy needs help and she needs independence. We've all known people like her (mostly women).  I own a dog and 2 cats (all adopted). I lost my first dog to old age and it was very hard. I was an SPCA volunteer in San Francisco for awhile. And I must say I find very little humor (or any positive qualities) in the movie, beyond the acting.Molly Shannon deserves better.

1084526,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000RZIGW2,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","It's a woefully uneven film that seems longer than its 97 minutes, yet Molly Shannon brings her particularly individualistic appeal to the role of Peggy, a diffident, socially awkward secretary whose most meaningful relationship is with her beagle Pencil. The attraction is understandable as the dog is adorable and attentive, whereas the people in Peggy's life are too self-absorbed to get past either judgment or indifference of her solitary existence. As he showed with his script for 2002'sThe Good Girl, screenwriter and first-time director Mike White has a unique way of presenting characters' idiosyncrasies onscreen that seems both bemused and generous. He brings Peggy's quiet desperation and passive acceptance to life with extended shots that seem almost taken from still-life photos. The inevitable occurs, and Peggy's feeling of culpability spirals her into despair groping for what she should do next.Most of the 2007 film deals with her tentative journey, and while much of the film is driven by character-driven laughs, there is a deepening sense of melancholy with every episode. Toward the final stretch, White unfortunately carries things too far and has Peggy go into extremities before finding her destiny, and her behavior at this point threatens to upend the goodwill generated by what happened before. Regardless, he has assembled quite an impressive cast to inhabit his somewhat askew characters starting with Shannon who manages to convey Peggy's loneliness with surprising subtlety. Consider that this otherwise slapstick comic actress has made her reputation on spastic, almost intolerable characters like Mary Katherine inSuperstaror Val, the obsessive, kleptomaniac neighbor in several episodes ofWill & Grace. Instead, her low-key portrayal comes close to Jennifer Aniston's exemplary work inThe Good Girl.Returning from that movie in typical hangdog fashion, John C. Reilly plays Peggy's lunk-headed neighbor who admits to killing his own dog in a hunting accident, a revelation that exposes his fascination with guns and dead animal heads. Regina King is her sassy self though oddly encouraged to play over-the-top as Peggy's sassy office co-worker Layla, whose own relationship with a philanderer unmasks as much desperation as Peggy's situation. Laura Dern is flat-out hilarious as Peggy's sister-in-law Bret, a well-meaning control freak married to overly cautious Pier played by Thomas McCarthy. There's also a funny turn by Josh Pais as Peggy's Dilbert-inspired boss, and Peter Sarsgaard takes a lighter but still bizarre turn than usual as Newt, the passively manipulative, sexually confused dog trainer who really sets off Peggy's darker side.The 2007 DVD comes with quite a few extras starting with the amusing, off-kilter commentary by White and Shannon. Their chemistry continues in a seven-minute ""Moviefone Unscripted with Molly Shannon and Mike White"", where the two ask each other questions from Moviefone users. There is the obligatory making-of featurette, the sixteen-minute ""A Special Breed of Comedy: The Making of Year of the Dog"". Those were satisfying enough, but there are also three additional shorts of only marginal interest - one focusing on the training of the dogs used in the film and the other two brief, four-minute profiles of Shannon and White. One extended and seven deleted scenes are included as well as a three-minute gag reel and a quick photo album of unique images presented as an insert reel.",3,Self-Discovery and an Alienating Social Conscience Intertwine in One Lonely Woman's Life,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,3467,"['woefully', 'uneven', 'film', 'longer', '97', 'minutes', 'yet', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'particularly', 'individualistic', 'appeal', 'role', 'Peggy', 'diffident', 'socially', 'awkward', 'secretary', 'most', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'beagle', 'Pencil', 'attraction', 'understandable', 'dog', 'adorable', 'attentive', 'people', 'Peggy', 'life', 'are', 'too', 'self-absorbed', 'get', 'judgment', 'indifference', 'solitary', 'existence', 'showed', 'script', ""2002'sThe"", 'Good', 'Girl', 'screenwriter', 'first-time', 'director', 'Mike', 'White', 'unique', 'way', 'presenting', 'characters', 'idiosyncrasies', 'onscreen', 'bemused', 'generous', 'Peggy', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'passive', 'acceptance', 'life', 'extended', 'shots', 'seem', 'almost', 'taken', 'still-life', 'photos', 'inevitable', 'occurs', 'Peggy', 'feeling', 'culpability', 'spirals', 'despair', 'groping', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'next.Most', '2007', 'film', 'deals', 'tentative', 'journey', 'much', 'film', 'driven', 'character-driven', 'laughs', 'deepening', 'sense', 'melancholy', 'episode', 'final', 'stretch', 'White', 'unfortunately', 'things', 'too', 'far', 'Peggy', 'go', 'extremities', 'finding', 'destiny', 'behavior', 'point', 'upend', 'goodwill', 'generated', 'what', 'happened', 'before', 'Regardless', 'assembled', 'quite', 'impressive', 'cast', 'inhabit', 'somewhat', 'characters', 'starting', 'Shannon', 'who', 'convey', 'Peggy', 'loneliness', 'surprising', 'subtlety', 'Consider', 'otherwise', 'slapstick', 'comic', 'actress', 'made', 'reputation', 'spastic', 'almost', 'intolerable', 'characters', 'Mary', 'Katherine', 'inSuperstaror', 'Val', 'obsessive', 'kleptomaniac', 'neighbor', 'several', 'episodes', 'ofWill', 'Grace', 'Instead', 'low-key', 'portrayal', 'close', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'exemplary', 'work', 'inThe', 'Good', 'Girl.Returning', 'movie', 'typical', 'hangdog', 'fashion', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Peggy', 'lunk-headed', 'neighbor', 'who', 'killing', 'own', 'dog', 'hunting', 'accident', 'revelation', 'fascination', 'guns', 'dead', 'animal', 'heads', 'Regina', 'King', 'sassy', 'self', 'oddly', 'encouraged', 'play', 'over-the-top', 'Peggy', 'sassy', 'office', 'co-worker', 'Layla', 'own', 'relationship', 'philanderer', 'unmasks', 'as', 'much', 'desperation', 'Peggy', 'situation', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'flat-out', 'hilarious', 'Peggy', 'sister-in-law', 'Bret', 'well-meaning', 'control', 'freak', 'married', 'overly', 'cautious', 'Pier', 'played', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'also', 'funny', 'turn', 'Josh', 'Pais', 'Peggy', 'Dilbert-inspired', 'boss', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'lighter', 'still', 'bizarre', 'turn', 'usual', 'Newt', 'passively', 'manipulative', 'sexually', 'confused', 'dog', 'trainer', 'who', 'really', 'off', 'Peggy', 'darker', 'side.The', '2007', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'starting', 'amusing', 'off-kilter', 'commentary', 'White', 'Shannon', 'chemistry', 'seven-minute', 'Moviefone', 'Unscripted', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Mike', 'White', 'where', 'two', 'ask', 'other', 'questions', 'Moviefone', 'users', 'obligatory', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'sixteen-minute', 'A', 'Special', 'Breed', 'Comedy', 'Making', 'Year', 'Dog', 'were', 'satisfying', 'enough', 'are', 'also', 'three', 'additional', 'shorts', 'only', 'marginal', 'interest', 'one', 'focusing', 'training', 'dogs', 'used', 'film', 'other', 'two', 'brief', 'four-minute', 'profiles', 'Shannon', 'White', 'One', 'extended', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'three-minute', 'gag', 'reel', 'quick', 'photo', 'album', 'unique', 'images', 'presented', 'insert', 'reel']",N/A

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[5, 5]","Year Of The Dog is a type of movie that I grow fonder of the more I think about it, and that's because what won me over about it is what surprises me the most.  I expected, I guess, Molly Shannon being another deluded middle-aged woman locked up in suburban patois and lunacy - it is, after all, a movie about a woman who can't come to grips with the death of a very small dog named Pencil.  I suppose she is suburban, a little repressed, and a little bit of a lunatic, but as written by Mike White, she's also complicated and human, and more than that, itching to get out in true and genuine ways.  I've loved Mike White's scripts like Chuck & Buck and School Of Rock because they take premises that shouldn't succeed but do because their funniest moments are their truest.  The scene I remember laughing hardest at here is a moment between Thomas McCarthy and Laura Dern as Shannon's brother and sister-in-law rambling on about the PTA - it's a moment of great heart and humor because it is so accurate of the way that, truly, our friends and loved ones get lost in bourgeois america, but also of the heart and need to connect they still retain.  Year Of The Dog follows Shannon's Peggy into the pits of depression over her dead dog, and her decisions verge on the lunatic, alright, but what makes the movie such an accomplishment is that these decisions aren't making us laugh at her like a character on Saturday Night Live, they redeem her - as Peggy becomes a one-woman crusader to love animals, she also unearths the passion that her office job and stale life can't provide.  What makes me love Year Of The Dog so much - beyond a performance out of Molly Shannon that, I'm serious, was sensitive and adroit in a way that its year's Oscar nominees for best actress were not - is that it is ultimately a story about being true to your passions and not apologizing for who you are.

1084529,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B000RZIGW2,Genevieve Hayes,"[1, 2]","Peggy's dog Pencil is her whole life, so when Pencil meets an untimely death, Peggy (Molly Shannon) finds herself lost and in need of a replacement for him. This leads to Peggy becoming involved with two men, Al (John C. Reilly), who collects knives and hunts for sport, and Newt (Peter Sarsgaard), an animal rights activist, and ultimately leads to her changing her whole outlook on life.Writer/director Mike White's films can be divided into two categories: the commercial comedies (including ""School of Rock"" and ""Dead Man on Campus""), and the not-for-everyone's-taste, independent movies that sit precariously on the borderline between comedy and drama (including ""The Good Girl"" and ""Chuck and Buck""). ""The Year of the Dog"" falls very much into the latter category, so if you're considering watching this film based on the DVD cover claim ""from the writer of ""School of Rock"""", then you might like to give it a bit more thought. The same applies to the cover claim that this film is ""hilarious"". It is a funny film in parts, but I would class it more as a drama than as a comedy and the humour is of a more adult style than in ""School of Rock"".As with ""The Good Girl"" and ""Chuck and Buck"", White tells the story of an unusual person in an unusual and yet plausible situation. Peggy is unusual in her extreme devotion to animals, in particular her dog and the situation that she finds herself in after Pencil dies is not one that most people are likely to find themselves in, and yet, I could imagine someone like Peggy existing in the real world. Again, as with White's other movies, White doesn't provide any simple solutions to the problems Peggy faces. There is no Deus Ex Machina to save Peggy in the final act and for that I was disappointed (what can I say, I like happy endings), but also grateful because a Deus Ex Machina would have gone against everything White had set up in the previous acts.Of White's independent films, ""The Good Girl"" is still my favourite, but ""The Year of the Dog"" comes in a close second, and if you are interested in seeing one of White's ""other"" movies then this wouldn't be a bad place to start.",3,Not to be confused with one of White's more commercial films,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,2138,"['Peggy', 'dog', 'Pencil', 'whole', 'life', 'so', 'when', 'Pencil', 'untimely', 'death', 'Peggy', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'lost', 'need', 'replacement', 'Peggy', 'becoming', 'involved', 'two', 'men', 'Al', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'who', 'knives', 'hunts', 'sport', 'Newt', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'animal', 'rights', 'activist', 'ultimately', 'changing', 'whole', 'outlook', 'life.Writer/director', 'Mike', 'White', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'divided', 'two', 'categories', 'commercial', 'comedies', 'including', 'School', 'Rock', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Campus', ""not-for-everyone's-taste"", 'independent', 'movies', 'sit', 'precariously', 'borderline', 'comedy', 'drama', 'including', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'Year', 'Dog', 'very', 'much', 'latter', 'category', 'so', ""'re"", 'considering', 'watching', 'film', 'based', 'DVD', 'cover', 'claim', 'writer', 'School', 'Rock', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'give', 'bit', 'more', 'thought', 'same', 'applies', 'cover', 'claim', 'film', 'hilarious', 'funny', 'film', 'parts', 'would', 'class', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'humour', 'more', 'adult', 'style', 'School', 'Rock', '.As', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'White', 'story', 'unusual', 'person', 'unusual', 'yet', 'plausible', 'situation', 'Peggy', 'unusual', 'extreme', 'devotion', 'animals', 'particular', 'dog', 'situation', 'Pencil', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'yet', 'could', 'imagine', 'someone', 'Peggy', 'existing', 'real', 'world', 'Again', 'White', 'other', 'movies', 'White', ""n't"", 'provide', 'simple', 'solutions', 'problems', 'Peggy', 'Deus', 'Ex', 'Machina', 'save', 'Peggy', 'final', 'act', 'was', 'disappointed', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'like', 'happy', 'endings', 'also', 'grateful', 'Deus', 'Ex', 'Machina', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'everything', 'White', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'previous', 'acts.Of', 'White', 'independent', 'films', 'Good', 'Girl', 'still', 'favourite', 'Year', 'Dog', 'close', 'second', 'are', 'interested', 'seeing', 'one', 'White', 'other', 'movies', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'place', 'start']",N/A

1084531,A3F00QUIXGDTOW,B000RZIGW2,Jason Seagraves,"[3, 5]","I saw the trailer for this movie on an old DVD recently and wondered, ""Did this ever come out?"" Sure enough, it had -- two years ago -- and I'd completely missed it. Huh. So I checked out the Amazon reviews, which were a ""mixed bag"" to say the least. Focusing on the 1-star reviews, you'll notice that half of them are from PETA members who say this movie is not for animal lovers, it's too cruel; and the other half from people convinced that it's a piece of ""PETA propaganda"" (exact phrase used more than once). Given these contradictory views among those who hated it, I figured it was probably a good film -- and I wasn't disappointed. In fact, this one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, with some of the most outstanding acting you'll ever see.First, is the  movie for animal lovers? Perhaps not. There are a lot of pet deaths that are pretty emotional for an average person (such as myself) -- I could see how they'd be traumatic to a real animal lover. And the movie also examines subjects such as animal testing, factory farming, etc. It isn't a pure comedy by any means, and could be too disturbing for some animal lovers, I guess. And, for any crazies out there, you might be offended by the portrayal of some obsessed pet owners that could hit too-close-to-home.Secondly, is the movie ""PETA propaganda""? Absolutely not! I do not agree with PETA in the least, being a pro-property rights libertarian, and I did not see this film as ""PETA propaganda"" in the least. For one, the hunter (played expertly as always by John C. Reilly) is in no way a villain -- unless solely being a hunter makes one a villain. He's a perfectly nice guy, and it is Molly Shannon's appraisal of him that's off-the-deep end. Furthermore, there is a scene when Molly Shannon is taking her niece to a factory farm and her niece says, ""What would happen to all the animals if we didn't eat them,"" and Molly Shannon says, ""Uh... I don't know."" END SCENE. This isn't propaganda; it actually is a very even-handed appraisal of ""animal rights"" concerns. I'll add in that Molly Shannon's boss, a character who is thoroughly likable by the end of the film, dismisses her crusade against animal testing by saying, ""This is how we make medical breakthroughs, we don't do it because it's fun."" If this were PETA propaganda, then the boss and the hunter would be portrayed as evil and heartless, not as animal lovers themselves.What this film is is an intense character study of an animal lover, as played by Molly Shannon. She should have received Oscar consideration. Regina King is also excellent as her friend, and Peter Sarsgaard is great as an asexual animal trainer and vegan. But the best performance of all is the understated role of Molly's boss, played by Josh Pais. His performance and the handling of this character in general were perfect. The movie itself may have been a box-office bomb, but it will be a cherished gem for true movie lovers to discover over the years and decades to come, and a towering triumph of creativity by all those involved in its making. 5 Stars!",5,Great movie: Should have received Oscar consideration,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,3071,"['saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'old', 'DVD', 'recently', 'wondered', 'Did', 'ever', 'come', 'out', 'Sure', 'enough', 'had', 'two', 'years', 'ago', ""'d"", 'completely', 'missed', 'Huh', 'So', 'checked', 'out', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'were', 'mixed', 'bag', 'say', 'least', 'Focusing', '1-star', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'half', 'are', 'PETA', 'members', 'who', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'animal', 'lovers', 'too', 'cruel', 'other', 'half', 'people', 'convinced', 'piece', 'PETA', 'propaganda', 'exact', 'phrase', 'used', 'more', 'once', 'Given', 'contradictory', 'views', 'who', 'hated', 'figured', 'was', 'probably', 'good', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'fact', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'most', 'outstanding', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see.First', 'movie', 'animal', 'lovers', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'are', 'lot', 'pet', 'deaths', 'are', 'pretty', 'emotional', 'average', 'person', 'such', 'could', 'see', 'how', ""'d"", 'be', 'traumatic', 'real', 'animal', 'lover', 'movie', 'also', 'subjects', 'such', 'animal', 'testing', 'factory', 'farming', 'etc', ""n't"", 'pure', 'comedy', 'means', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'disturbing', 'animal', 'lovers', 'guess', 'crazies', 'there', 'might', 'be', 'offended', 'portrayal', 'obsessed', 'pet', 'owners', 'could', 'hit', 'too-close-to-home.Secondly', 'movie', 'PETA', 'propaganda', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'PETA', 'least', 'being', 'pro-property', 'rights', 'libertarian', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'PETA', 'propaganda', 'least', 'one', 'hunter', 'played', 'expertly', 'always', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'way', 'villain', 'solely', 'being', 'hunter', 'one', 'villain', 'perfectly', 'nice', 'guy', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'appraisal', 'off-the-deep', 'end', 'Furthermore', 'scene', 'when', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'taking', 'niece', 'factory', 'farm', 'niece', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'animals', 'did', ""n't"", 'eat', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'END', 'SCENE', ""n't"", 'propaganda', 'actually', 'very', 'even-handed', 'appraisal', 'animal', 'rights', 'concerns', ""'ll"", 'add', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'boss', 'character', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'likable', 'end', 'film', 'crusade', 'animal', 'testing', 'saying', 'how', 'make', 'medical', 'breakthroughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'fun', 'were', 'PETA', 'propaganda', 'then', 'boss', 'hunter', 'would', 'be', 'portrayed', 'evil', 'heartless', 'not', 'animal', 'lovers', 'film', 'intense', 'character', 'study', 'animal', 'lover', 'played', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'Regina', 'King', 'also', 'excellent', 'friend', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'great', 'asexual', 'animal', 'trainer', 'vegan', 'best', 'performance', 'understated', 'role', 'Molly', 'boss', 'played', 'Josh', 'Pais', 'performance', 'handling', 'character', 'general', 'were', 'perfect', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'box-office', 'bomb', 'will', 'be', 'cherished', 'gem', 'true', 'movie', 'lovers', 'discover', 'years', 'decades', 'come', 'towering', 'triumph', 'creativity', 'involved', 'making', '5', 'Stars']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[2, 7]","In order to do a successful film you need to fine and follow a good direction and that's where I thought I was heading until it took a turn without me. ""Year of the Dog"" opens on a field of frolicking puppies, then shows the dogs' humans circling the activity. Most of the humans are chatting among themselves, but Peggy (Molly Shannon) has eyes only for her beloved, adorable beagle Pencil. Peggy holds a generic job in a sterile office. She comforts her pedestrian boss as he suffers the slights of banal office politics. She's a sounding board for her workplace best friend. She baby-sits her brother's children and takes well-meaning advice from him and his wife. She's there for everyone, and Pencil is there for her: Pencil is her emotional core. When Pencil dies, Peggy's grief is overwhelming, leading to breakdown and collapse. She works through the void made visible by Pencil's death to eventually achieve a resolution to her personal crisis and a new direction for her life.While the movie purports to show a ""journey of personal transformation,"" as expressed in the press blurbs, it instead shows mental breakdown and tenuous recovery. Shannon's performance as Peggy. It's a far cry from the underarm-sniffing school girl of her Saturday Night Live past. Shannon, who has had wonderful turns with roles in Marie Antoinette and a short-lived Mike White sitcom, turns Peggy into a character with whom we easily empathize. Even her slip into the shallow waters of insanity seems forgivable when it occurs with such restraint and care.White's writing, more than Shannon, makes it easy to understand Peggy. As he tells this story, Peggy is surrounded by people whose own blind love makes them do or believe things that even the always-supportive Peggy sees as peculiar. We can laugh at the moments when Peggy's sister-in-law (Laura Dern) won't let her child have a cuddly stuffed toy because of the fibers in the toy's fur or when Newt explains how his relationships with animals have always been better than his relationships with humans. Not once does it seem mean-spirited. We laugh because our own obsessions are probably just as silly to people looking in from the outside.While I could have done without Peggy's Chaplin-esque soapbox moment at the end of the film, Year of the Dog halfly accomplishes what it sets out to do and does it while marching to the beat of a different drummer. What's more, White shows that his writing, in his hands or anyone else's, will always carry the quirky charm and humanistic tenderness that might put a smile on an audience's face. Other than that director's work succeeds only in coming in second to a good ""After school Special."" With unrelenting earnestness and ensemble support from the likes of John C. Reilly and Laura Dern, Year of the Dog was clearly intended as a message film extolling animal rights and the healing power of furry friends.

Only those who have lived closely to animals or those who are capable of unselfish sympathy will be able to recognize and appreciate the subtleties of this film.  Yet, for those who can appreciate it, it is very worthwhile, and for those who cannot, perhaps they will learn something valuable.Molly Shannon plays an introverted single woman who lives alone with her dog, whom she loves dearly.  One day, the dog gets dies unexpectedly, which, of course, has an immense impact on the woman.  This is not, however, a movie about one woman's loss, but about the implications of having a truly caring soul.  Shannon's character becomes an exploration of the many paths down which such a love can lead us.Those who care about animals will find this movie to be a sensitive, uncomfortably realistic echo of their own thoughts and experiences.  (Finally, a movie portrays animal rights activists as real people with legitimate goals.)

First-time director Mike White shows us how close they are, and how codependent Peggy is: they have dinner together, watch TV together, and sleep together, Peggy cuddling and hugging Pencil to her much as she might a boyfriend or husband. Pencil doesn't seem to mind.But then Pencil is ripped from her life. Having trespassed onto a neighbor's lawn (John C. Reilly), he is found one morning lying on his side, unresponsive. A terrified Peggy tears off to the veterinarian, but it's too late. He's gone. White handles this delicate scene well. Instead of force-feeding Peggy's loss to us with frolicking scenes of a happy Peggy and a bouncing waggily-tailed Pencil, he simply shows her sobbing in her car in the vet's parking lot. It's raw emotion, and Shannon delivers.The loss unhinges her, and she turns her mourning into a unique passion for life. Guided by an asexual clinic worker (Peter Saarsgard - if not brilliant as many are claiming, quite good in this roll) from her vet's office who helps place foster dogs, she is introduced to veganism, and PETA, amongst other ""animal rights"" activities, and she finds herself, suddenly, an accidental activist. Her newfound role disrupts the comfortable ones she has found herself in: spinster, gift-giving aunt, and trusted assistant to her boss.I referenced above that Shannon has made a career out of ""crazy"", and while that's true, her more hilarious characters usually display their own unhinged grasp of reality through various forms of physical humor (Mary Catherine Gallagher on SNL, and Val Bassett on Will and Grace). Here Shannon is reserved, at once dramatic and comic.Anyone that has ever had a pet (er, kid) is sure to love this.

They together provided the hits School of Rock and Nacho Libre (which White both scribed). The previously mentioned works are leaps and bounds better than this work of art. He creates characters that we cannot feel for as they are too hollow and one dimensional to actually emote for. They slowly go through the film as zombies, and never leave their trance, even when there is a break in the silence that I experience in my time watching the film. As I was watching the film, I wondered if White felt that he had enough clout as he has written some hit screenplays, and he thought he could do a own personal pet project,  forgive the pun, and try have people take him seriously.Well, I didn't take him seriously at all, as the movie itself is way too trying to be funny in a satire kind of way of PETA, but it makes itself a thinly veiled attempt at a comedy that promotes the PETA agenda or animal activist agenda. I personally love animals, but I don't love them to the extent that White puts the character, Peggy, in. Peggy is too meek and quiet of a character for you actually to feel for her. She is also too easy to seduce as a character because she believes and adapts to things just because her dog died. I had a dog die, I felt sad, but I was not as obsessed as she was with the dog that she had in this movie. She couldn't just move on. She had to listen to her activist friend lead her astray. Mike White, as a writer, hits a personal low as he tries unsuccessfully to shove his personal beliefs down your throat and suffocate you with a increasingly unfunny comedy that just is too dark for its own good.White's directing style is boring and unoriginal. He doesn't provide his actors with what they need. They sit there staring blankly into the camera not making me laugh at all or chuckle. They just try to liven up the script, but the script is dead on arrival. It is a script that would only please White and anybody else that found it remotely funny. The film goes into circles. Peggy doesn't discover anything. She just discovers what people do to animals, and she upsets the natural order of her life, and the people in her life see her as seriously ill of what she is doing, as she goes to extremes of her animal love. I remember one particular scene where I was not supposed to laugh, but I did. It was when Peggy is informed by Newt (Peter Sarsgaard, at probably his worst), that her second dog had killed one of his dogs in a vicious mauling, and that he had the state take the dog away. He sits there crying petting his dogs, and I couldn't help but laugh at how pathetic the character was and how much overacting that  Sarsgaard was doing. He was absolutely horrendous in this. John C.

It's just downright creepy...And not funny. Molly Shannon (never very talented in my opinion) plays Peggy, an office manager and dog lover. She lives a life of solitude with her dog Pencil and frequently visits her brother and sister-in-law (Laura Dern). It's clear from the beginning that Peggy is a little loopy. After Pencil dies; Peggy's sanity seems to break down. She goes on a date with her next door neighbor (John C. Reilly, who steals his few minutes) and than finds a kindred spirit in a dog lover named Newt (Peter Sarsgaard). John C. Reilly and Peter Sarsgaard are both really talented; As is Regina King, who plays Peggy's friend, but even these terrific actors can't hold this film together. Sarsgaard has always brough to mind a younger John Malkovich, his voice is definitely similar...But here, playing a possibly-gay and psychotic dog-lover, he just doesn't work. He plays his role as good as he can and he plays it better than most actors could have...But the part isn't that well written. Shannon is good as Peggy, she works...But she's not one of my favorite actresses. This movie is not terrible, but not being terrible doesn't make something good. I looked for qualities in ""Year of the Dog"" that could make me like the film and there is one or two funny moments (Reilly in all his scenes for example and Sarsgaard in the scene where he cries ""Valentine killed Buttons!""); But other than that, this film is, essentially, a failure.

Molly Shannon is often effective in the lead role as a mid-life woman whose beloved beagle, Pencil, dies unexpectedly from contact with poison. The subplots that develop from this premise are all based on what Molly does to fill the void that exists in her life after this unhappy departure. Her choices turn out to be a mixed batch, some good, some not so good, some tragic.""Year of the Dog"" itself is somewhat satirical, a wry poke at a time in a poor person's life when her world is shattered because of this loss. What she does to make up for this -- stealing money from work to dedicate it to animal causes, involving herself inappropriately in the lives of both her neice and best friend at work, investing herself in loser relationships with  a new maladjusted dog expert and a new dog, and taking out her hidden rage on a neighbor she believes responsible for setting all these actions in place, is often funny, touching, ridiculous and 100 percent involving.This film has little about it that seems to fit the standard for Hollywood. Just as it appears it's going to be a sad story turned into a new romance and happy ending, Molly's new boyfriend declares he can no longer see her because he doesn't like sex. When Molly then turns self-destructive on several levels, the film mimics what often happens in our lives when tragedy and bad luck take over our universes. She seeks way to punish herself and does so very well, engaging in antisocial activities that eventually get her fired from her job.And this is the trademark of the film: ""Year of the Dog"" often portrays itself to be about a familiar landmark constructed in dozens of moves you've seen; and, just as soon as that begins, it turns 90 degrees left or right, sometimes moving forward in a way you might and often going askew to represent Molly's schizophrenic new outlook built around loss and the failure to correctly grieve.If I've made out ""Year of the Dog"" to be something morose, serious or one of those blueblood films full of conflicted characters, it isn't. It is a small film with a great cast about living, loss, choices and consequences. It is funny while touching your emotions and engaging your pathos. Most of all, it's engaging through and through.

1084542,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B000RZIGW2,Lleu Christopher,"[3, 4]","Two things about this film surprised me. First of all, the fact that it deals with a serious issue in an intelligent, sometimes comic and balanced way. When you think about it, this is quite unusual for a Hollywood movie, even an indie-style one like this. The other surprise for me was that I actually liked it better as it went on. Movies often start off with an interesting premise and then lose steam towards the end, if not in the middle. Year of the Dog, however, gained momentum as it went along. I think this is because it had the audacity to raise the stakes on the animal rights issue and end up in territory that was unsettling.Molly Shannon, best known for her wacky characters on Saturday Night Live, plays Peggy, a single woman with an ordinary office job. Her closest companion is her dog Pencil. When Pencil dies suddenly, Peggy's life is thrown off balance and she gradually turns into an animal rights extremist. What is interesting is how the film traces her path down this unconventional road. We see how her loneliness, fondness for dogs and a certain lack of social graces combine to gradually turn Peggy into a fanatic. When she adopts a new dog, she befriends an employee at the shelter (Peter Sarsgaard), who also helps to convert her to veganism. When she becomes attracted to this man, he does not return the interest, telling her that he is celibate. This is an example of Peggy's lack of judgment; not to be politically incorrect, but this character immediately came across to me as gay, but Peggy does not notice this. She displays a similar lack of common sense when she takes her sister's children on a trip to a slaughterhouse to help convert them to her cause. As she becomes more extreme, she alienates everyone around her.Finally, one incident proves to be the last straw for Peggy. Her new dog turns out to be vicious; after it kills another dog it is euthanized. She responds by ""rescuing"" fifteen dogs marked for death at the shelter. At this point, she quickly descends into a breakdown. The film ends on a courageously ambiguous note. Peggy does not so much recover from her madness (if that's what it is) as come to terms with it.It would have been easier to simply satirize the extreme animal rights position, or to make us sympathize with it, but the film remains remarkably neutral. For example, at one point Peggy has an argument with her boss about animal experimentation. When she expresses her outrage, he makes the usual point that experimenting on animals saves lives. Both points of view are expressed, and we are left to decide for ourselves. Peggy's behavior is too bizarre to make her completely sympathetic. What the film does is suggest that we can respect her for sticking to her principles, whether we agree with her or not.",4,Animal Rights Fanatic,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,2783,"['Two', 'things', 'film', 'surprised', 'First', 'all', 'fact', 'serious', 'issue', 'intelligent', 'sometimes', 'comic', 'balanced', 'way', 'When', 'think', 'quite', 'unusual', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'even', 'indie-style', 'one', 'other', 'surprise', 'was', 'actually', 'liked', 'better', 'went', 'Movies', 'often', 'start', 'off', 'interesting', 'premise', 'then', 'lose', 'steam', 'end', 'not', 'middle', 'Year', 'Dog', 'however', 'gained', 'momentum', 'went', 'along', 'think', 'had', 'audacity', 'raise', 'stakes', 'animal', 'rights', 'issue', 'end', 'up', 'territory', 'was', 'unsettling.Molly', 'Shannon', 'best', 'known', 'wacky', 'characters', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Peggy', 'single', 'woman', 'ordinary', 'office', 'job', 'closest', 'companion', 'dog', 'Pencil', 'When', 'Pencil', 'suddenly', 'Peggy', 'life', 'thrown', 'balance', 'gradually', 'animal', 'rights', 'extremist', 'What', 'interesting', 'how', 'film', 'path', 'down', 'unconventional', 'road', 'see', 'how', 'loneliness', 'fondness', 'dogs', 'certain', 'lack', 'social', 'graces', 'combine', 'gradually', 'turn', 'Peggy', 'fanatic', 'When', 'new', 'dog', 'employee', 'shelter', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'also', 'convert', 'veganism', 'When', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'man', 'not', 'return', 'interest', 'telling', 'celibate', 'example', 'Peggy', 'lack', 'judgment', 'not', 'be', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'character', 'immediately', 'came', 'gay', 'Peggy', 'not', 'notice', 'similar', 'lack', 'common', 'sense', 'when', 'sister', 'children', 'trip', 'slaughterhouse', 'help', 'convert', 'cause', 'more', 'extreme', 'everyone', 'around', 'her.Finally', 'one', 'incident', 'be', 'last', 'straw', 'Peggy', 'new', 'dog', 'out', 'be', 'vicious', 'dog', 'euthanized', 'rescuing', 'fifteen', 'dogs', 'marked', 'death', 'shelter', 'point', 'quickly', 'breakdown', 'film', 'courageously', 'ambiguous', 'note', 'Peggy', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'recover', 'madness', 'what', 'come', 'terms', 'it.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'simply', 'satirize', 'extreme', 'animal', 'rights', 'position', 'make', 'sympathize', 'film', 'remarkably', 'neutral', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'Peggy', 'argument', 'boss', 'animal', 'experimentation', 'When', 'outrage', 'usual', 'point', 'experimenting', 'animals', 'saves', 'lives', 'points', 'view', 'are', 'expressed', 'are', 'left', 'decide', 'Peggy', 'behavior', 'too', 'bizarre', 'make', 'completely', 'sympathetic', 'What', 'film', 'suggest', 'can', 'respect', 'sticking', 'principles', 'agree', 'not']",N/A

Molly Shannon is funny and heartbreaking as Peggy, whose beloved dog, Pencil, unexpectedly dies, causing her life to go into a tailspin.  A lot of unfortunate things happen to poor Peggy over the course of the film--and by the end, I was still very concerned about her.  That's why I only give the film 4 stars--the ending bothered me because it left me feeling unsettled about Peggy's future.  I'm surprised by the extremely negative reviews for ""Year of the Dog""--it is ""a charming and quirky comedy"" as advertised on the DVD case--up to a point.  Then the story becomes increasingly dark, which I didn't mind.  In fact, it was kind of refreshing because there's nothing I hate worse than a predictable film.  And ""Year of the Dog"" is definitely not that.  There are a lot of twists and turns in the movie, and I enjoyed going along for the ride.But back to the talented cast: Besides Ms. Shannon's stellar performance, John C. Reilly, Peter Sarsgaard, Laura Dern, Josh Pais and especially the fabulous Regina King are all wonderful in their supporting roles. Ms. King steals every scene she is in and provides much of the movie's humor as Peggy's friend and co-worker.If you enjoyed director/writer Mike White's 2000 film ""Chuck & Buck"" (which he also wrote), then you'll like ""Year of the Dog"".  Both films are very dark and funny and introduce us to a troubled main character, whom some folks might be turned off by because of their behavior.  I wasn't--I wanted Peggy to find happiness in her life--I was in her corner and rooting for her throughout the film.  It's to Ms. Shannon's credit--and talent--that you do care about Peggy despite her flaws.  ""Year of the Dog"" isn't a perfect film, but it made me laugh out loud and almost cry and took me on a journey I hadn't been on before.

An unfortunate happening occurs with Pensil and since this moment on Peggy has to deal with a strange neighbour who is her opposite as he a hunter, collecting a lot of weapons, mainly knives, a very interesting role played by John C. Reilly (Al). Later she knows a nice young man, Newt, played by Peter Sarsgaard who deals and trains abandoned dogs and helps Peggy to get another dog. She accepts and starts liking Newt who helps her training the dog. Some other scenes shows how people, in my opinion, should treat animals in general. Peggy gets so envolved in the subject about animals that she even becomes a vegetarian. I confess, people, I like animals, I have a lovely Black Labrador and several cats but I eat meat. I'm an hypocrite. I should be ashamed, but I believe many people do the same. Who knows I change some day... So, returning to the movie, she makes her niece, a child to think like her. What happens at her sister-in-law's home when Peggy offers to stay with the children, so the couple can leave during the New Year's eve, this is the funniest thing I saw in this movie.I warn people who watch this movie as a comedy just because Molly Shannon is in there. It is a serious movie. And I liked it even though I cried some times. The conclusion is satisfactory, in my opinion, as Peggy got to do what would be from that moment on the most important thing in her life. I only give 4 stars as some scenes are really depressing, but some moments in real life are like this. And I am sure Mike White (director and writer) wanted us to see about it.

I won't give a synopsis of the plot, as a numer of the previous reviewers have already done that.  One would think that with the cast the producers had assembled, this film would be one of those movies which plays on the comic ironies of life.  It isn't.  The supporting characters are fairly one dimensional, only there to provide situations for Molly Shannon to play off of, so its hard to feel any real involvement or interest in them.  Perhaps thats why the cover of the DVD only shows Molly and her dog as an actual picture, while the rest of the cast are only line drawings.  The ending was peculiar, with Peggy (Molly Shannon)apparently deciding to devote her life to the welfare of animals rather than evolving into someone who could move comfortably in both worlds (people and animals).  You could term this a ""throw away movie"", as there is little about the film to encourage one to watch it again.  With Molly Shannon, I was expecting a funny script, but instead I sat through the film wondering where it was going.  Its a sad day when I felt more humanity in films like ""Never Been Kissed"" and ""Assault of the Killer Bimbos"" than I did in this one.

When her dog dies, she goes on a dating and dog saving spree at the urging of her friends and coworkers, but the plot just gets messier and messier.

What makes the film unique is that the love in question is a dog.  I have dogs and take care of them well, and can say that I love them, but I don't really know what it is like to love a dog like a child or like a genuine member of the family.  My reaction to the death of a pet would be similar to the reactions of most of the characters in this film.  To think: that is really awful, but that's life and I guess it's time to move on.  This film did help me see a bit what it would be like for one who can't think that way.  There are so many stories out there of individuals who can't see clear to living again after a loved one has died.  Invariably there are conflicts and struggles and anger and when they begin to live again their life has changed pretty radically.  As far as I can tell, the aim of this film is to tell a story like that with the loved one as a dog -- and the film is very successful in that.  (This is, at bottom, a story of a woman in pain who is trying to ""find herself,"" and while her love for animals is central to her story, animals do not figure in the story as characters.  This is a human story).  The lifestyle she comes to embrace is not conventional and may be unfamiliar to many but it is not unprecedented.

The plot is simple enough. Peggy Spade loses her beloved dog,Pencil, and has to cope with life afterwards. She puts her hopes into meeting a man to change her life, but is always disappointed. Then she discovers that she cares more about animals than people and joins groups like PETA. But she takes it a step too far. She almost becomes enraged and a little crazy with her new cause and goes WAY overboard. While I knew that this would be quirky and different I expected a romantic comedy. But maybe this movie was trying to go in another direction. But the direction it followed was uncomfortable and at times obsurd.Her character takes a major turn toward crazy pretty darn fast and I found it unbelievable. Would you ever adopt 15 dogs in one day and just let them poop everywhere? Would you really start stealing from your boss in order to donate money to a rescue center? Or would you ever break into your neighbor's house and try to attack him because he is a hunter? Or could you ever take a little girl to a slaughter house? While some of these scenes started out funny they became just wierd and over dramatic.

1084558,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000RZIGW2,RMurray847,"[9, 13]","Molly Shannon is a revelation in this film.  Her character could SO easily have become a caricature...and it wouldn't have surprised me to see a veteran of Saturday Night Live take the easy way out.  But Writer/Director Mike White clearly knew something I didn't...hidden behind Mary Catherine Gallagher was a sensitive actor looking for the perfect part.  Here it is.Shannon plays a 40-something worker in a smallish corporate office, where she serves as the Administrative Assistant to a middle-manager type.  She is quiet, competent and other than a somewhat unlikely friendship with the loud, brash Regina King...friendless.  She has a well-to-do brother who is married to Laura Dern, a hyper-sensitive parent...one of those parents who doesn't even want her daughter to know what death is.  Shannon feels that her life has enough love, however, because she dotes on her delightfully cute Beagle Pencil.  Pencil is her companion, and they share a small but lovely home.One night, Pencil wanders out of the yard, gets into something she shouldn't, and dies from poisoning.  Shannon is devastated by grief, of course, and we see how one person after another doesn't really seem to understand that losing Pencil wasn't the same as losing just a pet...she's lost the love of her life and now feels a void.Her next door neighbor (John C. Reilly) seems to have some glimmering that Shannon is going through something profound, and offers to take her out for dinner.  The ""date"" doesn't go to well, and the tentative friends slowly become adversaries.  Shannon also meets animal activist Peter Sarsgaard, who gets her another dog.  The two oddballs form a nice friendship, but Shannon wants something more...something Sarsgaard is unwilling to give.Essentially, the movie is a carefully observed study of one woman's descent into madness.  It is very specific, very credible and very, very heartbreaking.  We root for Shannon all the way through, even as she takes increasingly insane actions.  At first, she is consumed with grief, and we can recognize that.  Then she begins to do some doubtful things, and we  understand because we know she was sort of a lost, lonely soul to start with.  But she never seems to get her feet under her again...never regains the stability that Pencil seemed to offer her.How many of us have seen that story on the news about the crazy lady who is discovered with 30 filthy cats living in her house?  How could that happen, we wonder.  Well, this movie gives us one possible scenario.I don't quite know how Mike White does it...but his guy is great at writing films (CHUCK & BUCK, THE GOOD GIRL) showing people who ought to know better slipping more and more deeply into self-damaging behavior.  YEAR OF THE DOG is his most consistent, mature and touching work in this ilk yet.  I've seen it described as a tragicomedy.  There is some comedy...but the final feeling is far more one of sadness.  This is NOT a feel good movie.  But it is a MUST SEE movie...for the great script and especially for the lovely, understated, brave and unforgettable performance of Molly Shannon.  So far this year, her performance is the best I've seen by an actress.  I know Oscar won't come calling for such an off-beat movie that was released so early in the  year...but I sure wish it would!",5,Molly Shannon is FANTASTIC.

1084560,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000RZIGW2,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","****1/2You don't have to be an animal-lover to appreciate ""Year of the Dog,"" one of the cleverest, wittiest and most endearing movies of 2007.  Molly Shannon gives a tour-de-force performance as Peggy, a young Southern California woman who seems to have a much easier time relating to animals than she does to people.  Peggy is batting close to zero when it comes to the men in her life, but at least she gets to go home every night to her beloved pooch, Pencil, who showers her with the kind of unwavering, unconditional love that, for some strange reason, only pets seem uniquely qualified to give.  When the dog dies without warning, Peggy`s life at first goes into a tailspin, until some bizarre events and unforeseen encounters open up novel possibilities for her future.As an actress, Shannon is clearly a master of the dead-pan expression, and writer/director Mike White takes full advantage of that talent, often aiming the camera directly into her face so that we can get the full benefit of her character's reactions.  But this is far from a one-note performance.  Through studious attention to detail and a gifted comedienne's natural appreciation for the ridiculous and the absurd, Shannon brings poignancy and depth to a character that could easily have become a caricature in less gifted hands (if there were any justice in this world, Shannon would receive a Best Actress nomination for this role).White has written a screenplay that is as hilarious as it is touching, as silly as it is insightful.  Peggy floats along through life asking little of the people around her, but once she achieves her animal-rights epiphany, there is no stopping her from making a 110% commitment to the cause.  In her efforts to eradicate all animal suffering from the world - and expecting everyone else in her life to share that passion - she may be edging ever closer to the brink of madness, but, heck, at least she has a concrete purpose for her life.The beauty of the film rests in its slightly off-kilter view of the world Peggy inhabits.  For even though we may be tempted to question Peggy's mental health from time to time, she most certainly is not alone in having personal eccentricities and peculiarities.  Her co-workers, her relatives, the big-game-hunting neighbor next door, the animal-rescue worker who's so turned off by humans that he has opted for a life of celibacy - all become part of the  tapestry of bizarreness that White has woven for the film.In terms of the acting, Shannon is only part of the story, for the film boasts one of the best ensemble casts I've seen in a movie in quite some time, with Regina King, Laura Dern, John C. Reilly and Peter Sarsgaard, among others, all turning in finely-tuned, delightful performances.I'm sure that we have all known at least one person like Peggy in our lives, so I think that on some level just about everyone - canine-lover or not - can identify with this film.  The nice thing about ""Year of the Dog"" is that it doesn't strip Peggy of her quixotic notions, but, instead, allows her to venture forth from her restrictive environment and to find her own little niche in the world.  Peggy is one of those individuals who clearly marches to the tune of a different drummer, and ""Year of the Dog"" is a loving tribute to all such people.",4,Molly Shannon Shines in a Near-Perfect Comedy,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,3302,"['****1/2You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'animal-lover', 'appreciate', 'Year', 'Dog', 'one', 'cleverest', 'wittiest', 'most', 'endearing', 'movies', '2007', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Peggy', 'young', 'Southern', 'California', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'much', 'easier', 'time', 'relating', 'animals', 'people', 'Peggy', 'batting', 'close', 'zero', 'when', 'men', 'life', 'least', 'go', 'home', 'night', 'beloved', 'pooch', 'Pencil', 'who', 'kind', 'unwavering', 'unconditional', 'love', 'strange', 'reason', 'only', 'seem', 'uniquely', 'qualified', 'give', 'When', 'dog', 'warning', 'Peggy', 's', 'life', 'first', 'tailspin', 'bizarre', 'events', 'unforeseen', 'encounters', 'open', 'up', 'novel', 'possibilities', 'future.As', 'actress', 'Shannon', 'clearly', 'master', 'dead-pan', 'expression', 'writer/director', 'Mike', 'White', 'full', 'advantage', 'talent', 'often', 'aiming', 'camera', 'directly', 'face', 'can', 'get', 'full', 'benefit', 'character', 'reactions', 'far', 'one-note', 'performance', 'studious', 'attention', 'detail', 'gifted', 'comedienne', 'natural', 'appreciation', 'ridiculous', 'absurd', 'Shannon', 'poignancy', 'depth', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'caricature', 'less', 'gifted', 'hands', 'were', 'justice', 'world', 'Shannon', 'would', 'receive', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'role', 'written', 'screenplay', 'as', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'as', 'silly', 'insightful', 'Peggy', 'floats', 'life', 'asking', 'little', 'people', 'once', 'animal-rights', 'epiphany', 'stopping', 'making', '110', '%', 'commitment', 'cause', 'efforts', 'eradicate', 'animal', 'suffering', 'world', 'expecting', 'everyone', 'else', 'life', 'share', 'passion', 'may', 'be', 'edging', 'ever', 'closer', 'brink', 'madness', 'heck', 'least', 'concrete', 'purpose', 'life.The', 'beauty', 'film', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'view', 'world', 'Peggy', 'inhabits', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'tempted', 'question', 'Peggy', 'mental', 'health', 'time', 'time', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'alone', 'having', 'personal', 'eccentricities', 'peculiarities', 'co-workers', 'relatives', 'big-game-hunting', 'neighbor', 'next', 'door', 'animal-rescue', 'worker', 'who', 'so', 'turned', 'off', 'humans', 'opted', 'life', 'celibacy', 'become', 'part', 'tapestry', 'bizarreness', 'White', 'woven', 'film.In', 'terms', 'acting', 'Shannon', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'ensemble', 'casts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'quite', 'time', 'Regina', 'King', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'others', 'turning', 'finely-tuned', 'delightful', 'performances.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'known', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'Peggy', 'lives', 'think', 'level', 'just', 'everyone', 'canine-lover', 'not', 'can', 'identify', 'film', 'nice', 'thing', 'Year', 'Dog', ""n't"", 'strip', 'Peggy', 'quixotic', 'notions', 'instead', 'venture', 'forth', 'restrictive', 'environment', 'find', 'own', 'little', 'niche', 'world', 'Peggy', 'one', 'individuals', 'who', 'clearly', 'marches', 'tune', 'different', 'drummer', 'Year', 'Dog', 'loving', 'tribute', 'such', 'people']",N/A
1084561,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000RZIGW2,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[26, 29]","Screenwriter Mike White's ""Year of the Dog,"" which marks his directorial debut, was underappreciated during theatrical release last spring despite its being chockfull of wit, charm, intriguing characters and a fiercely original plot. Molly Shannon strays out of comedic bounds and nails the lead character of Peggy, proving she has a wealth of dramatic talent that has gone largely underused. Now on DVD, her performance is a grand revelation.Peggy is a typical wallflower working in a typical office building as a typical secretary. In her early 40's, her social calendar is an arctic wilderness yet she is acquiescent, for her supreme pleasure in life is devotion to Pencil, her impossibly adorable pet beagle. Pencil dies in a needless accident, however, and Peggy is sent into a harrowing tailspin. The death of a house pet may not seem more like an unfortunate event than a grand trauma, but viewers with this mindset are in for a surprise - the realization of Pencil's death is most rattling, and Shannon is a marvel to watch as her ensuing devastation twists and jerks throughout the course of the movie affecting all aspects of her life.No one is able to empathize with her sad state, which puts her at odds with the world. Her friend and co-worker Layla, a Type A personality portrayed by the incomparable Regina King, insists that Peggy pursue a romantic life, loosen up and ""stop shacking up with dogs."" Her brother Pier and sister-in-law Bret, played with [...]-retentive relish by Thomas McCarthey and Laura Dern, expect her to move on quickly and avoid saying ""d-e-a-t-h"" in front of their first-grader. Meanwhile, her self-involved boss Robin, played to archetypal tight-wound perfection by Josh Pais, expects an early Christmas bonus should ease her troubles. Her neighbor Al, played by the always reliable John C. Reilly, hardly offers her any comfort either - never mind that he may be indirectly responsible for Pencil's death.Then a light suddenly shines on Peggy in the form Newt, an ASPCA volunteer played by Peter Sarsgaard. As a result of their interactions and commonalities Peggy begins to feel parts of herself humanized that had before been merely dismissed, and soon embarks on a long, arduous journey that tests her willpower and inner spirit, not to mention her values.""I've always been disappointed by people. I've really only been able to count on my pets,"" she says. ""But it's enough.""Many will chastise White's script and question if PETA helped fund ""Year of the Dog"" due to its uncompromising look at the early stages that result in beef stew on the family table (though it never gets graphic) and animal rights issues in general. However, there are definite checks and balances within the script, which tells a story not about animals but about how one woman's deep love for them puts her on a path of self-discovery.""There are so many kinds of life in this life - so many things to love,"" says Peggy. ""This is my love. It is mine.""The idea that the definition of love is different for all people certainly warrants a movie of its own, and ""Year of the Dog"" does it justice many times over.

Mike White creates a pastel world that says ""yes, the sun shines bright even when one is paralized by grief and depression, and ultimately experiences a brief episode of psychosis.""In addition, he captures the reality that despite personal crisis, the people in your everyday life do not stray from their own way of thinking. You have to go through it on your own. Despite dangers.Peggy, played by Molly Shannon, is a single woman who has lost her dog. She is surrounded by friends and family who eagerly obsess about their children, their jobs, their egos , their causes, and their sex lives.All of the characters in `Year of the Dog' are myopic to their own way of thinking, and their own way of life. They do not question themselves, even when their choices are screwing them up. They care a lot about Peggy, and they mean well. But they are not able to offer support until Peggy is in serious trouble.The Beauty of this movie is that Mike White takes a character, who, in any other movie would be marginalized as ""Aunt Peggy with pictures of her beagle on her Christmas cards"", and makes her the most normal, and most affectionate character in the film. She tolerant and accepting of others. Her breakdown is both funny and difficult to watch.This story is very human. I think it is about grief and rejection, and what to do (and maybe a few thinks to avoid doing- like adopting a deranged German Shepard) when your loss and grief take you to a place that is difficult for others to understand.That, and I will never open a wine bottle with my teeth again.",4,"Really Funny, Really Sad, Really Human(e)",1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,1642,"['first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'Year', 'Dog', 'were', 'vivid', 'colors', 'film', 'Mike', 'White', 'pastel', 'world', 'yes', 'sun', 'shines', 'bright', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'paralized', 'grief', 'depression', 'ultimately', 'brief', 'episode', 'psychosis', 'addition', 'reality', 'personal', 'crisis', 'people', 'everyday', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'stray', 'own', 'way', 'thinking', 'have', 'go', 'own', 'dangers.Peggy', 'played', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'single', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'dog', 'surrounded', 'friends', 'family', 'who', 'eagerly', 'obsess', 'children', 'jobs', 'egos', 'causes', 'sex', 'lives.All', 'characters', 'Year', 'Dog', 'are', 'myopic', 'own', 'way', 'thinking', 'own', 'way', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'question', 'even', 'when', 'choices', 'are', 'screwing', 'up', 'care', 'lot', 'Peggy', 'mean', 'well', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'offer', 'support', 'Peggy', 'serious', 'trouble.The', 'Beauty', 'movie', 'Mike', 'White', 'character', 'who', 'other', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'marginalized', 'Aunt', 'Peggy', 'pictures', 'beagle', 'Christmas', 'cards', 'most', 'normal', 'most', 'affectionate', 'character', 'film', 'tolerant', 'accepting', 'others', 'breakdown', 'funny', 'difficult', 'watch.This', 'story', 'very', 'human', 'think', 'grief', 'rejection', 'what', 'do', 'maybe', 'few', 'thinks', 'avoid', 'doing-', 'adopting', 'deranged', 'German', 'Shepard', 'when', 'loss', 'grief', 'take', 'place', 'difficult', 'others', 'understand.That', 'will', 'never', 'open', 'wine', 'bottle', 'teeth', 'again']",N/A

In an interview, he said this movie was his all-time favorite, so coming from him, I thought this would be a good one to see.  Two of the same people who starred in Enlightened were in this (Laura Dern and Molly Shannon).  This review comes from not only a responsible dog lover, but a breeder and exhibitor for over 40 years of one breed of dog.The first thing that struck me was how irresponsible the owner of the Beagle &#34;Pencil&#34; was.  She drove off in her car and left him out in the yard!  Then she lets him out at night and goes off and does something else, then comes back to find him not by the door, so she calls his name.  He is off by the bushes doing God knows what, and he looks at her, then continues what he is doing.  She tried to get him to come a few times, and then she just gives up and goes to bed!  Who does that???  Right there, the whole thing was totally unrealistic.  Of course the dog will get into things when left to his own devices - it's a dog!!  They are curious scavengers!  Then after she realizes he had been poisoned, she had the nerve to blame the guy next door because he had a bag of snail bait/poison in HIS garage that the dog had gotten into.  It's not his responsibility to keep his garage free of things if he has no animals of his own - he couldn't have known his neighbor was so stupid as to allow her dog to just run free.The rest of the one-star reviews cover the rest of the movie's shortcomings.  At least I watched it for free streaming.  Mike White must never have had a dog or been a responsible owner.

""Year of the Dog"" is most recommendable primarily for the excellent performance Shannon delivers.  Anyone expecting Mary Katherine Gallagher style zaniness might be disappointed - but anyone who appreciates the more subtle side to Shannon's comic brilliance will likely be very pleased.  As an actress's showcase, the movie works extremely well.Actually, the supporting cast turns in great work as well - so well, in fact, that when the 90 minute movie ended I felt myself wishing it had been the pilot episode for a TV series.  While that is a great endorsement of the ensemble cast - it isn't as much so for the movie as a whole.  I didn't really feel the emotional involvement I wanted the movie to create.  The storytelling simply isn't very strong.  That's not to say it's entirely poorly written - far from it, since there are some great character moments throughout.  But I got the feeling that an hour and a half wasn't enough time to tell these character's stories.Maybe what I'm trying to say is:  the plot wasn't well developed.  Something vital was lacking, even considering that ultimately the movie is a very low-key character piece.  Wes Anderson might have better shaped the whole thing and given it more of a sense of completeness.

1084568,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000RZIGW2,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[12, 19]","Whatever message Mike White was trying to get across in ""Year of the Dog"", he failed. Miserably. Reminiscent of a public service announcement gone horribly awry, this film is a garbled mess of mixed messages, dreadful cinematography and a kaleidoscope of meaningless events that just don't add up to anything and don't push the story forward.Peggy (Molly Shannon) does everything with her dog, Pencil. He replaces her need for human companionship and she caters to him every waking moment. When Pencil mysteriously dies of toxic poisoning, her world comes crumbling down. She eventually adopts a new dog, Valentine, an abused creature that requires constant attention. Recommended to her by Newton (Peter Sarsgaard), a veterinary clinic worker, she brings Valentine to his house for training where she attempts to develop a relationship with Newton as he attempts to correct Valentine's uncontrollability. They both wearisomely realize that neither one is comfortable with normal human relationships. Peggy slowly recognizes that the only relationships she can truly depend on are with her pets, and sets about to prioritize her life and disburse justice to those who have meddled with her animal-rights activist ways.While this material might interest those who have similar relationship disorders and the inability to properly communicate with other people, it simply doesn't translate well as entertainment. The major theme of the film seems to be the culmination and observation of severe dysfunction and it's actually difficult to watch as Peggy sinks deeper and deeper into dementia; right up to the point where she contemplates murder. Murder? It's hard to believe that the melancholy trailer would have audiences convinced that this is a lighthearted comedy. There's actually almost no comedy present at all, and no characters are inserted as comic relief. As a study in character deterioration and the negative influences of losing a loved one, the film makes no attempts to be especially meaningful or poignant, and at several points, embarks down the road to nowhere. The overall message of the film is quite ambiguous and unsuccessful in convincing anyone to feel any particular way, especially about the importance of animal relationships and preservation. Little sympathy is created for Shannon's neurotic character, making it even more difficult to side with her on her views of animal treatment.It seems Shannon has now stepped over the boundaries of comedy acting and into the murky waters of drama. Like Jim Carrey and Robin Williams, her serious side is much less fun to view than her comedy roots. While her acting is itself adequate, she doesn't bring to the screen anything incredibly original or heartfelt; the character is severely unnatural and her performance satisfies that. The other characters are all decent, but rather unremarkable, including supporting roles by Laura Dern and John C. Reilly. What the actors fail to do, due largely to the incompetent screenplay, is to create interesting personas to watch.The screenplay is incredibly bland and awkwardly paced, which lends to the extreme mediocrity of the film. Numerous events such as the attempted murder scene and then Peggy's reintroduction back into the real world feel unbelievable and trite. The conclusion is especially misplaced and the idea that anyone has to connect with such a demented lead character is absurd. Such a large amount of abnormality is disturbing to watch and unsatisfactory when nothing gets accomplished.The cinematography was especially annoying. White used so many close-up shots that it stood out as noticeably inappropriate. Every five seconds the camera was shoved point-blank into someone's gaping maw. When close-ups are used not to stress an important expression or shocking event, but instead as a regular camera angle, it fails to create any kind of special impression on the viewer.Since this film missed its mark on everything it was trying to accomplish, and most importantly failed to entertain, I can't honestly recommend it to anyone. Fans of Mike White and Molly Shannon will be disappointed at this unconventional piece of cinema, as well as fans in search of a film about dogs. The fact that this film was picked up by Paramount at last year's Sundance Film Festival is something that will baffle me for years to come.- Mike Massie",1,Year of the Dog Movie Review,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,4363,"['message', 'Mike', 'White', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'Year', 'Dog', 'failed', 'Miserably', 'Reminiscent', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'gone', 'horribly', 'awry', 'film', 'garbled', 'mess', 'mixed', 'messages', 'dreadful', 'cinematography', 'kaleidoscope', 'meaningless', 'events', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'push', 'story', 'forward.Peggy', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'everything', 'dog', 'Pencil', 'need', 'human', 'companionship', 'caters', 'waking', 'moment', 'When', 'Pencil', 'mysteriously', 'toxic', 'poisoning', 'world', 'crumbling', 'down', 'eventually', 'new', 'dog', 'Valentine', 'abused', 'creature', 'constant', 'attention', 'Recommended', 'Newton', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'veterinary', 'clinic', 'worker', 'Valentine', 'house', 'training', 'where', 'develop', 'relationship', 'Newton', 'correct', 'Valentine', 'uncontrollability', 'wearisomely', 'realize', 'one', 'comfortable', 'normal', 'human', 'relationships', 'Peggy', 'slowly', 'only', 'relationships', 'can', 'truly', 'depend', 'are', 'pets', 'sets', 'prioritize', 'life', 'disburse', 'justice', 'who', 'have', 'meddled', 'animal-rights', 'activist', 'material', 'might', 'interest', 'who', 'have', 'similar', 'relationship', 'disorders', 'inability', 'properly', 'communicate', 'other', 'people', 'simply', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'entertainment', 'major', 'theme', 'film', 'be', 'culmination', 'observation', 'severe', 'dysfunction', 'actually', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Peggy', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'dementia', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'murder', 'Murder', 'hard', 'believe', 'melancholy', 'trailer', 'would', 'have', 'audiences', 'convinced', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'actually', 'almost', 'comedy', 'present', 'characters', 'are', 'inserted', 'comic', 'relief', 'study', 'character', 'deterioration', 'negative', 'influences', 'losing', 'loved', 'one', 'film', 'attempts', 'be', 'especially', 'meaningful', 'poignant', 'several', 'points', 'down', 'road', 'nowhere', 'overall', 'message', 'film', 'quite', 'ambiguous', 'unsuccessful', 'convincing', 'anyone', 'feel', 'particular', 'way', 'especially', 'importance', 'animal', 'relationships', 'preservation', 'Little', 'sympathy', 'created', 'Shannon', 'neurotic', 'character', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'side', 'views', 'animal', 'treatment.It', 'Shannon', 'now', 'stepped', 'boundaries', 'comedy', 'acting', 'murky', 'waters', 'drama', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'serious', 'side', 'much', 'less', 'fun', 'view', 'comedy', 'roots', 'acting', 'adequate', ""n't"", 'bring', 'screen', 'anything', 'incredibly', 'original', 'heartfelt', 'character', 'severely', 'unnatural', 'performance', 'satisfies', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'decent', 'rather', 'unremarkable', 'including', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'What', 'actors', 'fail', 'do', 'due', 'largely', 'incompetent', 'screenplay', 'create', 'interesting', 'personas', 'watch.The', 'screenplay', 'incredibly', 'bland', 'awkwardly', 'paced', 'extreme', 'mediocrity', 'film', 'Numerous', 'events', 'such', 'attempted', 'murder', 'scene', 'then', 'Peggy', 'reintroduction', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'feel', 'unbelievable', 'trite', 'conclusion', 'especially', 'misplaced', 'idea', 'anyone', 'connect', 'demented', 'lead', 'character', 'absurd', 'large', 'amount', 'abnormality', 'disturbing', 'watch', 'unsatisfactory', 'when', 'nothing', 'accomplished.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'especially', 'annoying', 'White', 'used', 'so', 'many', 'close-up', 'shots', 'stood', 'out', 'noticeably', 'inappropriate', 'five', 'seconds', 'camera', 'was', 'shoved', 'point-blank', 'someone', 'gaping', 'maw', 'When', 'close-ups', 'are', 'used', 'not', 'stress', 'important', 'expression', 'shocking', 'event', 'instead', 'regular', 'camera', 'angle', 'create', 'kind', 'special', 'impression', 'viewer.Since', 'film', 'missed', 'mark', 'everything', 'was', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'most', 'importantly', 'failed', 'entertain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'Fans', 'Mike', 'White', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'unconventional', 'piece', 'cinema', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'search', 'film', 'dogs', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'Paramount', 'last', 'year', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'something', 'will', 'baffle', 'years', 'come.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A
1084569,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000RZIGW2,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 12]","""Year of the Dog"", written and directed by Mike White (""Chuck and Buck"", ""School of Rock"") and starring Molly Shannon (most well-known for her work on ""Saturday Night Live""), is a low key comedy that starts off in a promising fashion but ultimately becomes tiresome.Peggy (Molly Shannon) is a single office worker living in her large house in the San Fernando Valley with her small dog, Pencil. Peggy idolizes her beagle, spending as much time as possible with him, enjoying every activity he partakes in, eating with him, sleeping with him. Peggy also enjoys bringing baked goods to the office (doughnuts, muffins, etc.), and stands sentinel as her office workers enjoy the treats and thank her for the goodies. One evening, Pencil wants to go out in the middle of the night, so Peggy opens the door and goes back to sleep. The next morning, Pencil hasn't returned. As she investigates, she hears him barking from the neighbors and knocks on Al's (John C. Reilly) door. They find Pencil in his backyard, sick. Peggy rushes him to the vet, but it is too late. Upset, she returns to work but can't concentrate. Her friend, Layla (Regina King), thinks this will finally help Peggy find a man, the dog was a distraction in her life. Her brother, Pier (Josh Pais) and sister-in-law, Bret (Laura Dern), don't offer any help because they won't discuss d-e-a-t-h in front of their young daughter. One day, Newt (Peter Sarsgaard), a worker at the vet's office, calls Peggy and asks her to adopt a German Shepherd who just arrived and will probably be put down. Peggy gladly takes the dog and asks Newt to help her train him. As they work together, Peggy becomes attracted to Newt. But will he return her affections?""Year of the Dog"" begins in a promising fashion. Director White and Shannon have created a very real portrait of a lonely woman who lives through the one being who returns her affection, her dog. There is a lot of richly observed comedy as we watch Peggy go through the motions of her life. She stands in the kitchen, eating her frozen dinner as she watches Pencil eat his dinner. She smiles and laughs as Pencil enjoys his time romping around at the dog park. She sends out Christmas cards featuring a picture of her and her dog wearing Santa caps. At work, she tries to offer encouragement to her boss, she seems to derive pleasure from the minimal, grudging attention she receives from her co-workers when she brings doughnuts (they're barely able to say `thank you'), and she is shocked, but hooked, on her conversations with Layla about her friend's love life.Shannon does a great job of giving Peggy nuance that you might not find in a normal, run of the mill comedy. When she visits her brother and stepsister, she watches impassively as the married couple explains their philosophies of child rearing and discusses the treatment of their nanny. She is nervous, in an understated way, when she goes on a date with Al and then on another date with Newt. This all works very well.The supporting cast is also very good. John C. Reilly makes a memorable appearance as Al, the neighbor who tries to commiserate with Peggy. An awkward lummox, Al's attempts to offer sympathy are laughingly misguided. Peter Sarsgaard is also good as Newt, the trisexual who enters Peggy's live; he loves men, he loves women, he loves dogs. Laura Dern is great as the waspy Bret, who believes she is the perfect mother; notes line almost every surface, reminders of policies, allergies, do's and don'ts.A good indication of how low key this film will be can be found in two of the character's names... Peggy's last name is Spade and Newt's first name is, well... Newt. If you haven't already figured it out, these two pet lovers are named after what all pet lovers, including Bob Barker, feel you should do to your pets. Have them spade or neutered. It is an eccentric touch giving us an indication of how offbeat the filmmakers want ""Year of the Dog"" to be.After the film gets going, and Peggy meets Newt, she begins to want to impress him. He is a vegan, so she becomes a vegan and starts espousing the ideals of that lifestyle. Then, she tries to help Newt find places for all of the animals that need homes. Then, she begins to find out about refuges; farms and other habitats that take in animals and help them live a more natural life. This is all interesting for her character, but it becomes a bit preachy. As she learns new things and becomes invested in them, director White seems to want to educate the audience as well. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but the education is not subtle. Also, given the audience for this film, I suspect most of the people who will attend a screening of ""Year"" are at least familiar with these ideas. It becomes a bit like preaching to the choir. It also becomes tedious and brings the story, the humor and the characters to a grinding halt.It is nice to see Molly Shannon in a leading role, something that shows off her gifts as a comedian and an actress. Her previous film work has been very broad and only highlighted the same comedy she is already known for from her years on ""Saturday Night Live"". Here, she is playing what could conceivably be a real person, just a bit funnier. It is a nice performance that will hopefully lead to many more.This is director White's first film; his previous credits have been as a writer. He shows some promise; he is able to plumb the little moments in a normal person's life for humor, but this film is not a great effort. It is ultimately too slow, too meandering and too preachy for its own good.",3,"Good, until it loses focus",1179360000,"05 17, 2007",2007,5583,"['Year', 'Dog', 'written', 'directed', 'Mike', 'White',

1084570,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000RZIGW2,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[4, 9]","So this movie begins with a happy woman and her happy dog. Molly Shannon is very happy with her dog Pencil. Pencil is a sweet dog. Pencil is the kind of dog that you really just have to love.And then he's dead.Yes. This is a movie kills the dog. In the first 10 minutes. Sure, it might be transgressive to kill the dog. Hell,What Just Happened?makes a joke out of a director's intransigent refusal to remove the dog-killing scene even though every audience member hates it.And then it gets even more depressing. Forget all that part about our plucky heroine finding love and acceptance and her life back. Not happening in this movie. Instead she dates the neighbor only to find out that he's a crazy hunter. She dates a guy at the shelter only to discover that he's asexual. She gets a replacement dog - who also dies. She adopts shelter dogs. And they get taken away. Her brother and sister-in-law don't appreciate her and thinks that she's crazy. The boss becomes more and more impatient with her animal rights moonlighting and she breaks up her best friend's engagement.So she starts out the movie as a sad lonely woman who only loves her dog. And she continues to walk through the movie as a lonely depressive.Most of the dogs are cute, but don't get too attached.By the end there's some lightness but for the msot part this is a depressing little movie that just starts bleak and doesn't let up.",2,A depressing slog through the world of Indie Filmmaking,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,1400,"['So', 'movie', 'happy', 'woman', 'happy', 'dog', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'very', 'happy', 'dog', 'Pencil', 'Pencil', 'sweet', 'dog', 'Pencil', 'kind', 'dog', 'really', 'just', 'have', 'love.And', 'then', 'dead.Yes', 'movie', 'dog', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'Sure', 'might', 'be', 'transgressive', 'kill', 'dog', 'Hell', 'What', 'Just', 'Happened', 'joke', 'director', 'intransigent', 'refusal', 'remove', 'dog-killing', 'scene', 'even', 'audience', 'member', 'hates', 'it.And', 'then', 'even', 'more', 'depressing', 'Forget', 'part', 'plucky', 'heroine', 'finding', 'love', 'acceptance', 'life', 'back', 'Not', 'happening', 'movie', 'Instead', 'neighbor', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'crazy', 'hunter', 'guy', 'shelter', 'only', 'discover', 'asexual', 'replacement', 'dog', 'who', 'also', 'shelter', 'dogs', 'get', 'taken', 'away', 'brother', 'sister-in-law', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'crazy', 'boss', 'more', 'more', 'impatient', 'animal', 'rights', 'moonlighting', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'engagement.So', 'out', 'movie', 'sad', 'lonely', 'woman', 'who', 'only', 'dog', 'walk', 'movie', 'lonely', 'depressive.Most', 'dogs', 'are', 'cute', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'attached.By', 'end', 'lightness', 'msot', 'part', 'depressing', 'little', 'movie', 'just', 'bleak', ""n't"", 'let', 'up']",N/A
