But today you can watch FOX News and observe how this type of propaganda is created and spread. A funny thing though is that the first RAMBO is a good movie. I love it.

75101,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0784011222,Austin Somlo,"[1, 3]","Viewed: 11/03, 10/07Rate: 810/07: For Rambo III, I was expecting a lot of cheesy scenes and tedious action sequences, but I was wrong. Rambo III is a great action flick, combining elements from previous two films. The difference between First Blood and Rambo III is the amount of action. In comparison with Rambo: First Blood Part II, Rambo III Is less boring when it comes down to action sequences. Also, it has more dialogue, better story, and more fun. Sylvester Stallone's body keeps getting more ripped while his acting improves. One good thing out of Rambo III is giving a side to the people of Afghanistan. I think it was a touching speech by one of the elders during the huddle talk. Of course, I could have been fooled easily if somebody told me that Rambo III is what happened in Afghanistan during the 80's. Rambo III has become notoriously bashed (I am not sure why) since its inception, but to be honest, it's not all that bad. Quite frankly, it's a very enjoyable action picture with lots of bang-bangs. I love the villain in Zaysen, played very well by Marc de Jonge. There is a great scene in Rambo III where Rambo in a tank dueling Zaysen in a helicopter. It reminds me very well of Mad Max or The Road Warrior. In many ways, Rambo III is the best of the series. I see a much more coherent story and a better balance than ever. I could tell that Sylvester Stallone learned from his mistakes and strived to make Rambo III the best possible. Very evident in the improvements, every mistake made in First Blood and Rambo: First Blood Part II is corrected in Rambo III. I am surprised that the director knew what the best parts of the previous two films were. One of them is the helicopter scenes. That works very well again in Rambo III. I gotta say, I was very entertained by Rambo III.7/11: Rambo III is arguably the best picture of the Rambo trilogy. This one is more action-packed and contains more intensity over the two predecessors. Sylvester Stallone is obviously in his top form, and while watching Rambo III, it is easy to see how much work he has put into it. It's not a daily occurrence either that the topic of the film is Afghanistan. I think that is what made Rambo III super interesting to watch. All in all, if you want a pure action flick, you can't go wrong with Rambo III.",4,"ARGGHHHH! KILL KILL KILL!!!!! LET'S GO, RAMBO!!

About a month ago I bought this movie used for 4 dollars and watched it.From start to finish it was just a great movie.  A lot of the details are somewhat historically correct also and the extras are awesome (be sure to watch them if you buy this).  The Russians were invading Afghanistan and the US was aiding the Afghans (the Mujahideen).  The main arab leader who in the movie said ""They rape our women and kill our children"" was based on a real freedom fighter named Ahmad Shah Massoud who was assassinated by al-Qaeda 2 days before September 11th 2001.  After the Russians left, the Taliban took over.If you liked Rambo First Blood or the second Rambo, you will probably really like this movie.

But I hated ""Rambo lll"" right from the start.  Its Wahabbist propaganda was merely ignorant back then, but in the wake of 11-September, utterly appalling now.  It's impossible to watch the film without gasping in disbelief at the political lunacy of those days.  Still, our tormented hero might be forgiven his misplaced zeal.  Obviously Troutman never showed him any photos of 19-year-old Soviet conscripts dismembered and skinned alive, or of Afghan civilians murdered by the mostly foreign mujahedin who would eventually comprise the ruling Taliban.  There aren't any female characters in the film.  Even so, Rambo couldn't have foreseen that Afghan women under Wahabbist oppression would soon come to call themselves the ""living dead"".  Particularly bizarre now is the scene in which Rambo gives a child-guerrilla his Buddha necklace.  Ignore the fact that a devout Muslim would neither want nor wear an infidel image.  And forget that the casually discarded pendent was Rambo's only memento of the brave Vietnamese girl who had died saving his life in ""First Blood ll"".  Only remember for a moment the Bamiyam Buddhas, priceless ancient treasures blasted to smithereens by Taliban decree.  Thanks to real-life Troutmans and the CIA, plentiful US funds, weapons, and training turned Afghanistan into Soviet Vietnam and propelled the rise of a certain young Saudi exile from mujahedin commando to terrorist mastermind.  Meanwhile, real-life American Vietnam vets and their Soviet ""afgantsi"" counterparts have established international support groups.  In the final irony, America now seeks Russian advice in combatting Rambo's erstwhile allies.  This film's single star is justified only by its exploitation of Stallone's fabulous physique.  Rumor has it Sly is considering reprising his famous heroic role.  I hope so!  Maybe the aging but always awesome Rambo, outraged by his former friends' fiendishness, will return to the caves of Afghanistan to kick some Al-Quaida butt!

I do not criticize it for its historical awkwardness-one must judge the movie from when it was made and not by all of the things that have happened since that time.  Simply put, in the last film Rambo fought the country of Vietnam and the Russians.  In this film, he takes on the Russians in Afghanistan.  The action is better in this film than the previous one and I was more entertained.  Aside from the action aspects, however, the dialogue is even more pathetic than the second one.  This is, of course, with the exception of the monologue one of the Afghanistan rebels makes.  But the dialogue has been minimized in this film to a ridiculous level-there is hardly any talking at all.  That's okay, however.  All I really wanted to see was Rambo and that big knife anyhow.I was also interested in the final stage of character development the writers tried to pull off in the first couple of minutes.  Trautman tries to convince Rambo that he is nothing more than a fighting machine-a killer.  One would think, or hope, that John's mentor would have higher hopes for him.  Instead, he reduces Rambo to nothing more than a killing machine.  Sure, he's a character that overcomes oppression to bring brutal justice to thousands.

It certainly has action and destruction, but something is not quite right overall....Then it hit me. The kid. That's thing that has always rubbed me wrong about this film. And the more I think about it, the more sense it makes. Any film in which the adult hero gets all buddy-buddy with a child (regardless of the child's ""importance"" to the plot) tends to lose peoples' interest. For example: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,  Star Wars: Episode 1, Last Action Hero, and so forth. Children simply do not belong in an adult action world, and the films which involve them in the storyline truly do seem to suffer from public disinterest, not to mention bad filmmaking.This film also has comparatively more ""talk"" than the first two, and is slower to build. The scene in which Rambo is participating in the Afghan horseback game is clearly ridiculous filler material, and some of the characters are just annoying. I can't explain why. They just are. Especially that kid. He bugs me just as much as he bugs Rambo.We also see Rambo's trainer/mentor Col. Trautman get into the action, not that that is anything exciting. It's odd that the guy who claims to have made Rambo the killing machine that he is has none of the abilities of his student. For a ""Green Beret""--especially one who allegedly has enough skill to warrant being a trainer--his performance in combat is pathetic. Trautman is less a ""killing machine"" than a washing machine.There are however some humorous moments which is a new concept to the franchise (""It turns blue."") and not entirely unwelcome, but I believe less talk about the Afghan plight against the Russians, less children, and the body count of the second film would have helped this one immensely.

People just need to understand that things were different back then and the nature of politics is change. I really have no interest in that point of view at all when watching this film. What really bothers me is how completely unrealistic it portrays warfare and battlefield operations. Truth is, Rambo should've been dead ten times over. For instance, when the Russian gunship drops the bomb just before Rambo drops into the cave, it would've been completely reasonable to expect a bomb of that size to not only produce a larger explosion, but collapse the roof of the cave onto Rambo. Then, when Trautman and Rambo take cover from the Russian army in the trench, one has to wonder if the Russian troops were trained by the same guys who trained the stormtroopers in Star Wars. What should've been like shooting fish in a barrel became a total farse for the Russians. Just lob a few grenades in there and watch the body parts go flying! And isn't it funny how a molotov cocktail will disable a t-64 tank? I mean, I could understand if it was a t-34, but a 64? The tank doesn't even seem to suffer any physical damage, and runs fine when Rambo uses it. Yet, for some reason the Soviet tank crew seems obliged to evacuate it. Not only that, but a tank that requires several crewmembers to operate can now be driven by ONE guy when Rambo hijacks it! Not only can he act as a driver, but as a gunner too by somehow managing to reload the main gun while driving the tank at the same time! Finally, is it even necessary to state how dead Rambo would be as soon as he hit that chopper? The best one can hope for in this movie is the music, unfortunately the rest of it makes about as much sense as a G.I. Joe cartoon, but at least with a cartoon you know what you're getting.

75122,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,0784011222,G. Garner,"[20, 23]","Rambo 3 is usually regarded as the weakest in the series. However, I love this film, simply because Stallone plays a borderline superhero better than anyone else. How many other men can combine such a powerful physical presense with so much force of character? While the real-life Stallone is certainly not as virtuous as Rambo, he is known to have incredible willpower and determination. These qualities dominate his portrayal of John Rambo.You look into this man's eyes and you simply cannot imagine him being small or petty. He is reminiscent of Harry Callahan in that regard. Whatever his limitations  may be, his integrity and courage are beyond question. In addition, Stallone is so devoted to the discipline of bodybuilding that he has actually managed to create a distinctive look for this film. (As he has done on many other occassions for various movies.) Stallone is so powerfully built in Rambo 3 that he actually seems like an extension of the rugged Middle Eastern desert environment. But, back in the 80's, his approach was always Spartan.....he kept himself on such a strict diet, and was, by his own admission, so overtrained, that he could easily have been even more developed, had he wished.But that Spartan approach suited the roles he played to absolute perfection. His range may be limited, as we saw in his 'comedy' films, but when he sticks to his forte, playing great heroes, Stallone is the greatest ever.However, Rambo 3 has other good qualities besides Stallone. There are several great action sequences. The opening stick fight is brutal and effective. The helicopter attack on the Afghan village is horrific and violent. Crenna's character seems to summon a warmth from Rambo that we do not often see. They work well together. There's a terrific hand-to-hand fight between Rambo and a mammoth Russian soldier(the literal embodiment of the Soviet bear). Anybody who thinks you can't infuse something with a healthy dose of realism, while still making it compelling and entertaining to watch, should check out this fight. The fight is a traditional, Hollywood-style brawl.....but it also features the intensity, and desperation, that you would expect in a fight between two such awesomely powerful men......where each man knows that the loser will die. There's some really great footage of the brutal Middle Eastern landscape. The climactic battle is great. The villain is effective. This is a great action film. While the story may not be as interesting as the first or second entries in the series, it is outstanding in its own right. It is simply a bit more comic strip in nature. It is rather like an updated version of Captain America. This is not intended to be a realistic war movie, but rather an epic action spectacle, with Rambo's loyalty to his only remaining friend serving as the impetus to everything that occurs.One additional note........for those of you who care, they really went all out making this film. You can see every dollar on the screen. Lots of incredible shots of tanks and helicopters, mounted troops, etc. Plus, Stallone and the stunt people threw themselves into this movie in a way that you'll rarely, if ever, see again. There are lots of shots where you get helicopters and horses.....in the same frame!!! While I've never tried it personally, I would expect that getting that kind of footage, where helicopters fly so low that you can capture them right over the heads of the horses......I just imagine that has to be very difficult, as well as extraordinarily dangerous for all involved. There are scenes where they fly right over Stallone's head.......and this was at the time when Stallone was the highest paid actor in the world. (in fact, he even raved about the particular horse he rode in his book......seems to have been an incredible animal).Back in the day, Stallone treated films like this with as much dedication as if he had been doing Shakespeare. The results speak for themselves. Take the 4 Rambo films and Cliffhanger.......those films alone are as impressive as anything in the action realm. And that's just scratching the surface of his accomplishments in this genre.The special features are also quite good. However, the movie is worth the money even if there were no extras.

Actually, this one sounded very interesting, but I did not watch it until now.  One reviewer pointed out this was considered the weakest of the three; why is it the weakest is also the most enjoyable (as said reveiwer also seemed to agree).One reviewer mentioned the boy was one reason this movie was not as successful, and gave other examples, though failing to mention Aliens (maybe because that was an exception).  Actually, it helped.  So did the relationship between Rambo and Trautman.  I also thought the scene of Rambo riding underneath the tank to avoid the searchlight was original and creative.The edition I saw had a documentary on a myth of an American hero.  They commented that Rambo was one of four characters in print that made the cross to being heroes on the big screen:  the others were Sherlock Holmes, Tarzan, and James Bond (since then, you can add Harry Potter to the mix.)  The one comment I'll make is that Rambo is unique in the mix, because his character did not survive the original novel.I found this movie enjoyable.  Too violent for some people, two examples of unnecessary cussing (all cussing is unnecessary, by the way), and at times it was unbelievable.  It is interesting seeing this pre 9/11 movie from a post 9/11 persptective.

75129,A319SKSB556033,0784011222,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[4, 5]","Whatever credibility Rambo once had in First Blood is totally gone in this film which is more like Cold War propaganda than anything else, which is probably why they chopped First Blood off the title and we're simply left with the Rambo bit. As a character he's a bit more talkative but still has the...(read more) same sadness in his eyes. And Stallone is absolutely HUGE. Yes, he's always been big but his figure in Rambo III is probably the biggest I've seen him. He could probably rip Arnie's head off.Since walking off into the sunset in Part II, Rambo is now living in a monastery in Thailand and has found inner peace. But he still takes time out to batter people with sticks in cage fights to raise money for the Buddists. But the no-good Red Ruskie Soviets are causing havoc in Afghanistan and one particular Colonel is taking great pleasure in massacring whole villages.Colonel Trautman and Robert Griggs (the ever-brilliant Kurtwood Smith) try to convince Rambo to come help them sort the Ruskies out. But Rambo is having done of it. He's done killing! He wants to raise a family.So Trautman is left to go it alone and is captured. Griggs delivers this bad news to Rambo who makes up his mind to go on another killing spree. Which is entirely okay as long as he only kills the Ruskies right?Once in Afghanistan, Rambo teams up the Muhujideen, learns of their many woes and agrees to fight the Ruskies with all his might. Even though he was going to do that anyway, but it's nice to have friends.The rest of the film is no more than a succession of comic-book action scenes and shoot-em-up set pieces. It's brilliantly shot, seriously, it's some of the best cinematography I've seen in an action film. I never expected Rambo III to look so good! It's a shame that Peter MacDonald (who was actually the second unit director shunted into 1st place after Russell Mulcahy left) doesn't stage the action with any sense of fluency. Yes, it all looks big and bold, but it's kinda clumsy and cumbersome. At the time, it was the most expensive movie ever made (even at a mere $65 million) and while it may be grand, it sure ain't graceful.Jerry Goldsmith's score is once again brilliant. But quite a lot of his original material was left out and old tracks from Part II spliced in. So as long as your prepared for sudden jump cuts in the music, you should really get a kick out of it.When it originally came out, Rambo III was kinda disregarded as a totally unnecessary sequel but in recent years the film has gained a political subtext and can actually be viewed in quite a few subversive ways. While I understand that the makers wanted to give the film a serious point of view regarding the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, I feel that integrity that the film has in modern politics should be disregarded. This is a RAMBO movie for Christ sake. The logic is shoot now, ask questions never. America did do the right thing by helping the Afghans fight off the Ruskies. But they did they wrong thing leaving the country to crumble afterwards (just like Rambo does). The rest is history. But I don't think a review of Rambo III is the best place to discuss this.It's a flawed sequel, but I like it better than Part II. There are some seriously misjudged moments but it's still a fun ride. Once the victim of the most amount of cuts forced by the tyrannical BBFC the violence in Rambo III pales in comparison to the shocking carnage of the fourth film.Filmed in JDC-Scope, the Blu Ray features a fine 2.4:1 1080p transfer and good DTS HD sound.

These were the days when the Russians were fighting in Afghanistan. John Rambo, retired Army Special Forces expert, with long curly hair and many body scars, is in Thailand fighting in a sports ring. He is hit more than a dozen times without being able to land a hit of his own. We see that he is able to stand strong body blows that would have felled a lesser man, a foreshadowing of what is to come. Then, he beats his opponent with several well placed blows.His former colonel and a State Department official come to Thailand to ask him to join the colonel in a mission in Afghanistan to support the Mujahidin, later called Taliban, against the Russians. Rambo refuses. However, when the colonel goes alone and is captured, Rambo rushes to save him. The State Department tells him that if he goes and something goes wrong, the Department will deny that it sent him, because they do not want to fight in Afghanistan.When he comes to Afghanistan, everyone tells him that the Afghans will ultimately win against the Russians, just as they beat the English, because no foreign nation can beat them. He and one Afghan go to the Russian fortress to save the colonel. An Afghan boy follows Rambo to help him. A lot of violence follows.Will Rambo be able to save the colonel? How many times will he be wounded? Will the colonel survive his mistreatments and his wounds? Will the Afghan man and the boy survive? Will the Afghans come to Rambo's rescue?

75136,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,0784011222,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","With two successful entries into the `Rambo' franchise, it was hardly surprising that fan and studio anticipation would be high for any upcoming sequel that would make its way to theaters nationwide. So, six years after the character's first appearance on the big screen that led to him becoming one of America's iconic action heroes, Sylvester Stallone returned once again to throw John Rambo back into action with ""Rambo 3"". But, how easy would it be for Stallone and company to at least equal if not surpass the quality of the first two films in the franchise, ""First Blood"" and ""Rambo: First Blood Part 2""? The answer would be, not too easy at all, but the creative forces behind this franchise were determined to try their best to make the audiences proud.""Rambo 3"" begins with John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) living out his days free from prison walls, and existing in peace while working at a monastery. When Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives to entice Rambo to assist him in aiding the people of Afghanistan against the invading forces of Russia, Rambo's peaceful existence seems once again destined to be short-lived. However, Rambo rejects Trautman's plea for help, with the claim that his war is over. But it seems that fate has a different destiny in mind for Rambo, when word arrives that Trautman and his team have been captured by the Russians, Rambo finds himself being thrust back into a war that he didn't ask for. Knowing that Trautman would never leave him behind, Rambo does the only things he can think to do, locate the enemy, eliminate the enemy, and rescue his friend no matter the cost.When ""Rambo 3"" came out the anticipation surrounding the film was understandably high; however, upon release many people, both critics and fans alike, felt let down by this entry into the series. The criticisms were relatively uniform in nature, most were related to a seeming lack of content and story to propel the movie onward, and that ""Rambo 3"" opted for an over-reliance on big explosions and action sequences to keep the audience distracted from the paper-thin plot. I suppose I can see the critic's point of view on this movie, the story did seem a bit weaker than the previous two installments; however, I don't believe that the story was so lacking that it relied solely on the action to keep things moving along as many modern action flicks seem to do. The story for ""Rambo 3"" wasn't as deep as the previous two films, in fact it didn't seem to touch on Rambo's psychological issues whatsoever, but by the third film it was probably time to move completely past those plot points anyhow. Even with the psychological issues being left out of the film, the overall plot to the movie was very interesting and socially relevant, since the film was being made, and was even set during the late 1980's, the content was appropriate due to the United States assisting the people of Afghanistan against the invading forces of Russia (little did we know that our assistance would backfire on us later on in September 2001). So, to all those that criticized ""Rambo 3"" for a lack of content, maybe you should give the film another look; I admitted the story wasn't as strong as that of ""First Blood"" by any means, or even ""Rambo: First Blood Part 2"" for that matter, but it still manages to hold its own within the `Rambo' franchise and serves as a better than average entry into the action film genre.Sylvester Stallone and Richard Crenna, the only two actors to appear in the first three `Rambo' films, both know their characters inside and out by this point, that every movement, spoken word, and emotion seems so natural and effortless. I appreciated that some attempts were made to give Rambo some semblance of humanity by having him crack a few jokes and one-liners here and there over the course of the film, it showed to me that even though this is the third film in the franchise, there is still a desire to further develop John Rambo as a real character, and not just another stoic action hero with zero emotion or range. The remainder of the cast was equally talented, and comprised of no one of any real standing in Hollywood. Even though the film didn't boast the bigger name talent that the other films had, other than Stallone and Crenna that is, the acting was still very solid all across the board which is surprising that there wasn't any obvious over-acting occurring by an over-zealous actor trying to make his role a breakthrough for his career.""Rambo 3"" is by no means the best entry into the venerable franchise, but it's also not nearly as bad as the critics would like for you all to believe. I for one, found the film to be another exciting, action-packed entry into this popular franchise, and thought it to be a film that needed a second glance rather than writing it off based on critics' opinions. The story was very relevant for its time, though seems a bit out of place in the overall franchise when you look at it from a post-9/11 perspective. I mean, one of America's heroes fighting alongside some of the very people that will try to kill us several years later, but that's the downside to making socially relevant films that take place during a specific place and time, sometimes later on down the line the choice to make that film doesn't seem as wise. The action sequences were just as big, if not bigger than those of ""Rambo: First Blood Part 2"" and the body count was obviously higher than either of the first two films, but that seems to be the way things go in Hollywood action films and even horror movies for that matter. If you're going to make a sequel you must always have a bigger body count. By pointing out the increase in violence, I'm not trying to say that the action is the main driving force of the film, not at all; the story still propels the movie forward on its own, and is not the least bit dull when stuff isn't being blown up on screen. So, for those of you that loved the first two entries into the film and maybe didn't watch this third attempt based on the poor critical response, go ahead and give it a try you won't be sorry; and if you happen to be one of those viewers that were somewhat disappointed by the film, give it another look, who knows you might be surprised to find that it's better than you originally thought.""Rambo

75137,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0784011222,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","Having been betrayed by his government a couple of times too often, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) needed a better motive to leap back into action for ""Rambo III."" This is provided when Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) goes off to Afghanistan to help the Mujahedeen rebels fight the Soviet invaders only to be captured by Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge). Rambo, who had refused to go with Trautman because he is in Thailand becoming a Buddhist, now heads for Afghanistan on an unauthorized rescue mission.""Rambo III"" has the formula down, which is a way of saying the plot is totally predictable and an excuse for a whole lot of explosions. Rambo is the most buffed up Buddhist the world has ever seen and I have a minor theory that he has the whole Sampson thing going with his hair getting longer in each movie. This 1988 film was not only the most expensive film ever made when it was released (a whopping $63 million in those pre-""Titanic"" days), but made it into the ""Guiness Book of World Records"" as the most violent film ever made with a grand total of 221 acts of violence and over 108 deaths (it must be the former number that is important because a whole lot of nukes go off at the end of ""Dr. Strangelove"" and the entire planet exploded at the end of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"").Once again, the political dimensions of a ""Rambo"" film came into play, with the series shifting to Afghanistan, which was being called the Soviet Union's Vietnam, a metaphor that actually turned out to be more than wishful thinking. True, the Mujahedeen of yesterday became the Taliban down the road, but I still remember when the American public applauded the idea that the Shah of Iran had been deposed and replaced by the Ayatollah Khomeni. But in 1988 ""Rambo III"" was considered an exercise in freedom fighting and the Soviet Union was still the Evil Empire.The obvious analog to ""Rambo III"" is ""Rocky IV,"" in which Stallone continues to explore American-Soviet relationships. However, today ""Rambo III"" has been stripped of its politics and reduced to a non-stop action film. If there was some creativity to go along with the violence, as in the forest sequence in the original ""First Blood,"" then this film would be able to rise about the level of cartoon violence, but that is not the case.",3,"This time Rambo goes to the Soviet Union's ""Vietnam""",1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,2302,"['Having', 'been', 'betrayed', 'government', 'couple', 'times', 'too', 'often', 'John', 'Rambo', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'needed', 'better', 'motive', 'leap', 'back', 'action', 'Rambo', 'III', 'provided', 'when', 'Colonel', 'Samuel', 'Trautman', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'Afghanistan', 'help', 'Mujahedeen', 'rebels', 'fight', 'Soviet', 'invaders', 'only', 'be', 'captured', 'Colonel', 'Zaysen', 'Marc', 'de', 'Jonge', 'Rambo', 'who', 'had', 'refused', 'go', 'Trautman', 'Thailand', 'becoming', 'Buddhist', 'now', 'Afghanistan', 'unauthorized', 'rescue', 'mission', 'Rambo', 'III', 'formula', 'down', 'way', 'saying', 'plot', 'totally', 'predictable', 'excuse', 'whole', 'lot', 'explosions', 'Rambo', 'most', 'buffed', 'up', 'Buddhist', 'world', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'minor', 'theory', 'whole', 'Sampson', 'thing', 'going', 'hair', 'getting', 'longer', 'movie', '1988', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'most', 'expensive', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'whopping', '63', 'million', 'pre-', 'Titanic', 'days', 'made', 'Guiness', 'Book', 'World', 'Records', 'most', 'violent', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'grand', 'total', '221', 'acts', 'violence', '108', 'deaths', 'must', 'be', 'former', 'number', 'important', 'whole', 'lot', 'nukes', 'go', 'off', 'end', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'entire', 'planet', 'exploded', 'end', 'Beneath', 'Planet', 'Apes', '.Once', 'again', 'political', 'dimensions', 'Rambo', 'film', 'came', 'play', 'series', 'shifting', 'Afghanistan', 'was', 'being', 'called', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Vietnam', 'metaphor', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'True', 'Mujahedeen', 'yesterday', 'became', 'Taliban', 'road', 'still', 'remember', 'when', 'American', 'public', 'applauded', 'idea', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'had', 'been', 'deposed', 'replaced', 'Ayatollah', 'Khomeni', '1988', 'Rambo', 'III', 'was', 'considered', 'exercise', 'freedom', 'fighting', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'still', 'Evil', 'Empire.The', 'obvious', 'analog', 'Rambo', 'III', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'Stallone', 'explore', 'American-Soviet', 'relationships', 'However', 'today', 'Rambo', 'III', 'been', 'stripped', 'politics', 'reduced', 'non-stop', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'creativity', 'go', 'along', 'violence', 'forest', 'sequence', 'original', 'First', 'Blood', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'rise', 'level', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'not', 'case']",N/A

Yeah! Right! What crap!Of all the reasons to hate this film, and there are MANY, but I won't list them all here; just the one that has always bothered me the most, is the title. The first movie was called ""First Blood"", then the sequel ""Rambo: First Blood Part 2"", so how did the people who made this garbage EVER get away with the title ""Rambo III""???!! There never was a movie called ""Rambo"" except for the subtitle of the sequel, so to me that would be as lame as calling the third sequel to ""The Omen"" (there were three films in that series: ""The Omen"", ""Damien: Omen II"", and ""Omen III: The Final Conflict"") ""Damien 3"".There never should have been a third film with the Rambo character, but if Hollwood really felt it necessary, then it should have been called by its rightful title: ""First Blood Part III"", NOT ""Rambo III""! That is a tremendous insult to moviegoers everywhere, highly displaying the dumbing down of our nation, making it extremely blatant that intelligence can take a back seat where this is concerned.And, the scary thing is, well, look at all the ""good"" reviews on here. THAT'S scary!!! Why? You may ask. Well, in case I wasn't clear about what I was saying about the mistake in the title, let me remind you that there never was a ""Rambo"", or a ""Rambo II"". It was ""First Blood"" (which was an extremely good film, by the way), then the ill-conceived sequel, ""Rambo: First Blood Part 2"".This is an abysmally bad film, no matter what the title was.

Because of that, these films are serve to enlighten the viewer about bad things going on (or WERE going on) that they might not otherwise be aware of. In the case of Rambo III, it was the Soviet persecution of the Afghani people.And as I stated in my review of Part II, each Rambo movie shows us a different side of the character. In III we see how he is tired of fighting but nonetheless must come to terms with his identity as a killing machine. We also get deeper insights into his relationship with Trautman.When all is said and done, though, what you felt about Part II is probably what you'll feel about Rambo III.

Cowen,"[1, 1]","The film is basically about Rambo going into Afghanistan to rescue his former commanding officer and along the way helps afghan rebels fight Russian invadersThe pros in my opinion. I love a good action film now and then. And Rambo has plenty of action. The 1990 Guinness World Records deemed Rambo III the most violent film ever made at the time, with 221 acts of violence, at least 70 explosions, and over 108 characters killed on-screen. If you want action then this film is for you. If you're a Stallone fan then this film is for you. I like that the film is based based on a real life war that was going on. I was really feeling this film and the character Stallone has crated when he was infiltrating the Russian base. Him sneaking around under tanks,jumping through holes and creeping around made me feel like I was in a real life metal gear solid game. The last battle with him driving the tank fighting a helicopter was the icing on the cake for a great ending battle scene. The film has some extras features as well. I haven't been through most of them,but enjoyed the directors commentary very much. The dialogue in the film isn't the greatest,but I don't watch action films expecting Shakespeare. I want see to Rambo kick some butt and that's pretty much all to it.Now the cons. Not much I didn't like about the film. There isn't a deep storyline here. Not much character development. Anybody wanting a more realistic idea of soldiers in battle should look someplace else. The movie spent some time showing Afghans playing games like putting a dead sheep in a circle. I felt that it was a bit of a waste of time and wanted Rambo to get right to it. The main Russian bad guy was pretty much not worth talking about or even remembering. I really wish they could get a memorable enemy for the Rambo films. I do kind of wish the film could have spent a bit  more time on the plight of the Afghans and war crimes the Russians were committing against them. As some have mentioned here there are a few corny lines in the script which could have been worked on.All in all I really enjoyed this film and think it's underrated in America. It's a great action film with pretty much a comic book view on war. Many people say this one was the weakest in the series,but I love them all.

Also, due to the recent oppresive heat wave that has crashed upon the North Pole, Sid halucinated and thought he was in an Afghan desert, so Rambo III just felt right. However, whileFirst Blood (Special Edition)andRambo: First Blood, Part 2were clearly good enough to recieve 5 stars from Sid, Rambo III fell short. Please note that we're talking about the movie here, not the trancendant Rambo III video game on Sega which would recieve roughly 38 out of 5 stars. As always, visit Sid the Elf's Movie World for the Rambo III trailer, all our reviews; and some of our favorite pics, sound clips and videos. If you don't crack up at least 10 times on our site, you don't have a soul. Ok, back to the review.This time, Rambo is somewhere in Asia living in a Buhddhist monestary--now this is true. And, the first appearence in the film by John J. is at a seedy Asian fight club. He is stick-fighting some guy who looks like he just missed the cut to be in The Samoans. Anyway, Rambo is eventually approached by his old mentor, played by Richard Crenna. He needs Rambo to help him out with a mission in Afghanistan against the Russians. Rambo declines and Crenna predictably gets captured during the mission. So, word gets back to Rambo and he decides to...yep, infiltrate the camp where Crenna is a prisoner and bust him out. Rambo gets some help along the way from Bilo and Bilo's son. They give him some stellar backup, ammo and teach him a new sport. Aparently, in Afganistan, the sport of choice isn't anything remotely cool. No, it's mounting a horse and carrying a gym bag covered in faux fur across a sort of goal line. ""Like football,"" Rambo says. Um, yeah Rambo, kinda. This is one of the funniest and best scenes in the entire film. Not a good sign.Now, Rambo makes it to the prison camp. He has to take out roughly 78 guys by himself. But, he has the wonderful old explosive tip arrows, a grenade launcher, and a ton of other awesome weapons. This is great and all, but where were these things being stashed? Did Rambo carry them in his black wife-beater? Were they kept in Bilo's cage? It was just a distracting thought. As in all action movies, the hero has to take out the top bad guy after he takes out the top bad guy's henchman. These were the shining moments in Rambo III, well, except for gym bag-horse football. Rambo takes out the henchman in quite possibly the coolest way in action film history. The henchman has Rambo in a ferocious bear-hug. Rambo wraps some rope around the guy's neck, pulls the pins from the grenades hanging from the guy's jacket, gets out of the bear hug, and kicks the guy down a hole leading to a cave. So, as he's decending into the cave he freakin' blows up! This scene is absolutely awesome. Above all else, if you're on the fence about seeing Rambo III, see it for this scene. If you like action at all, you will love this part. Then there is the little matter of Rambo vs. the head bad guy. He was the warden of the prison camp, the Russian Drumgoole. So, this guy is in a helicopter and Rambo is in a tank. These two are moving towards one another, playing chicken, but neither swerve. Sid would love some feedback on this: When the helicopter and tank crash, is it actually realistic that the guy in the helicopter dies and the guy in the tank walks away merely dazed?Rambo III was a strange entity. It had no descernable plot, terrible acting, and the tired 80's theme of Evil Russians. But, it was a Rambo movie. So, you're guaranteed Stallone and an inordinate amount of explosions which make it watchable. This was an interesting point in Sly's career. Rambo III was preceded by Rambo II, Rocky IV, Cobra, and Over the Top. Impressive. His next film, after Rambo III, was the legendaryLock Up. Very impressive.

Look upon this action film as just that and you shouldn't have any problems.After Rambo declines an offer to help his former CO, Colonel Sam Trautman, in a mission to help middle-eastern ""rebels"" in their fight against the Russian Army, the Vietnam Vet. is forced back into action after Trautman is captured by Russian forces.""Rambo III"" is easily the weakest of the three films. The dialogue is stilted. The scene where Trautman explains to Rambo that he will always be a warrior is a howl (especially the reference to the sculpture and the artist). There is a bit of goofy one-line humor from Rambo that doesn't really work (lines like ""I fired a few shots."" are like lead bombs). The cave sequence had a been there done that feel. ""Rambo III"" was released for the Memorial Day weekend of 1988 & by this time the industry had been saturated with films inspired by or similar to the first 2 ""Rambo"" films.The S.E. DVD is worth a look at for the interesting featurettes, including ""A Land In Crisis"". Trailers and the usual special edition items are also included.As for ""Rambo IV""?

75164,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,0784011222,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 0]","This is a perfect exemple of a time sensitive movie,the material in it has a different impact that it had back in 1988.After First Blood parts 1 and 2,Sylvester Stallone returns for a third time as his famed character John Rambo.This time Stallones takes Rambo to Afghanistan.What is ironic thought is that Rambo is fighting WITH the afghan people wheras today,since since 9/11 they aren`t exactly liked.That is one bad thing about Rambo III,it is out of date and can no longer appeal to modern crowds because of that.Unless you saw it before that but even then it doesn`t feel right to know that an American hero is fighting alongside ennemies.At the time Stallone wanted to show solidarity for the freedom fighters of afghan against the Russian.Add to that the fact that this is very unrealistic and it just lost whatever appeal it had left.It is to note that Stallone looks even more impressive than he did in the second Rambo and was probably at his peak.John Rabo heads to Afghanistan in order to save his handler Colonel Trautman.At the beggening of the movie we see Rambo fighting in a monastery living a quiet life.He learns the news about Trautman and quickly leaves to rescue him.The storyline is pretty good and captivating but the execution of the plan is somewhat left to be desired.One thing great about the movie is of course the loads of action but also the fight that Trautman fights alongside Rambo in war scenes and shows what he`s capable of,and there was much to expect after all,he was the one who trained Rambo in the first place.It is pretty unrealistic,but in this one it`s gotten pretty bad I have to say.For exemple Rambo drives a tank and fires at the same time,yet the Russians need a full crew just to maneuver the tank funny isn`t it?One thing I hated about the movie is when John gives his necklace,which was the only thing he had left from the Vietnamese girl he meets in First Blood Part II who saved his life to some kid who wants it.It should have been more important to him.There is plenty of action but you can`t mask the fact that it lacks something behind the action.The special features.The features from previous releases are gone for the most part.The first Rambo had the alternate endings while this one has pretty much nothing.There are trailers for the movie,retrospectives and that`s about it.There are many possibilities for audio and visual which gives way to many options to set the movie to your liking with the metascopes and other modes that let you watch the film in different ways.I wonder why they cutted the extras,they did the same for the Rocky remasters.My advice : if you have the older versions don't get these you won't get anything new.its not worth it.If you cans score one of these ""Special Editions"" then you might consider yourself to have gotten a great deal.Those ""Ultimate Editions"" aren't so ultimate after all.""Rambo III"" gets mixed reactions.It does not suit everyone be advised so have to know a minimum on the movie before you actually rent and/or buy it.As mentionned above those editions aren't the best and the older editions are much better.Yet this one is easier to find and ainvailable nearly everywhere DVDs are sold which is pretty much the only advantage with these Ultimate editions.You can also save a lot by buying the ""Ultimate Edition"" boxed set of the first three Rambo.Overral,a solid sequel definatly worth seeing.Not the best Rambo but plenty of action and entertaiment here.You can't go wrong by picking this up if you are a fan of action movies and/or Sylvester Stalone,I liked both so this definatly worked for me.NOTE: A few weeks prior to writting this review the fourth Rambo was

In RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD II, Rambo redeemed himself and his country by returning to Vietnam to rescue imprisoned American POW's. The Vietcong in the film were backed and financed by Communist Russia, foreshadowing events to come in RAMBO III. In this movie, Rambo's mentor Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) is taken prisoner in Afganistan while assisting the Afganian rebels against the invading Soviet forces. Rambo comes ""out of retirement"" from working in a Buddahist commune to rescue his old friend and teacher. In the process he becomes friends with the Afganian people and ends up kicking the tar out of the Soviet military.There are a lot of inaccurate depictions in RAMBO III. However, the Rambo films aren't about staying true to truth and reality (well, FIRST BLOOD is an exception). They are about a new modern American superhero; a guy who is invincible, a one-man army who gets to blow lots of things up, kill lots of bad guys, all for the sake of truth, justice, and the American way.I admit the film seems totally different since September 11, 2001.

I was hoping that this third installment would harken back to what made that first one so memorable, but was only marginally better than Part II.For a basic plot summary, this time John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) finds himself in the middle of the Afghanistan/Soviet conflict after Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) is captured.Unfortunately, ""Rambo III"" takes the ""Rambo as superhero"" approach once again, focusing on the brawn and automatic gunfire instead of any deep or interesting political or psychological subject matter.  There's a little bit more character development than the second effort, and the plot is a titch better as well (seeing as how it was based on a real-life conflict), but overall it once again disappoints.There's a reason why it took 20 years for Sly Stallone to return to this franchise after this film, and it's because this second lackadaisical effort in a row killed off interest in the franchise until the ""reboot"" years of recent filmmaking.  It won't bore you as much as Part II, but it won't have you cheering like you did at Part One, either.",2,Only Slightly Better Than Part II,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,1301,"['second', 'edition', 'First', 'Blood', 'series', 'featured', 'little', 'more', 'mindless', 'action', 'never-ending', 'explosions', 'bevy', 'guns', 'unlimited', 'ammunition', 'eschewing', 'gritty', 'psychological', 'approach', 'original', 'was', 'hoping', 'third', 'installment', 'would', 'harken', 'back', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'one', 'so', 'memorable', 'was', 'only', 'marginally', 'better', 'Part', 'II.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'time', 'John', 'Rambo', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'middle', 'Afghanistan/Soviet', 'conflict', 'Colonel', 'Trautman', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'captured.Unfortunately', 'Rambo', 'III', 'Rambo', 'superhero', 'approach', 'once', 'again', 'focusing', 'brawn', 'automatic', 'gunfire', 'instead', 'deep', 'interesting', 'political', 'psychological', 'subject', 'matter', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'second', 'effort', 'plot', 'titch', 'better', 'well', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', 'based', 'real-life', 'conflict', 'overall', 'once', 'again', 'reason', 'why', 'took', '20', 'years', 'Sly', 'Stallone', 'return', 'franchise', 'film', 'second', 'lackadaisical', 'effort', 'row', 'killed', 'off', 'interest', 'franchise', 'reboot', 'years', 'recent', 'filmmaking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'as', 'much', 'Part', 'II', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'cheering', 'did', 'Part', 'One', 'either']",N/A

He was coming off of ""Rocky 4"" and ""Cobra.""I believe Stallone wanted to make a Rambo film that deals with the Middle East, since the two previous films were set in either America or Vietnam.""Rambo 3"" begins with Col. Trautman searching for Rambo in Thailand. Trautman witnesses him stick fighting and follows him to where he works in a Buddhist Temple. The reason why Trautman is pursuing Rambo is because he is going into Afghanistan to help bring supplies and weapons to Afghan Rebels. Rambo decides not to go saying ""It's got to end for me sometime.""In Afghanistan, Russians capture Trautman's team. Word gets back to Rambo, and he decides to go on a rescue mission to save Trautman.Overall, ""Rambo 3"" is better than the sequel, but still lacks the great story that ""First Blood"" had.",3,"Improvement, but still lacks great plot",1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,873,"['When', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'started', 'work', 'Rambo', '3', 'was', 'height', 'career', 'was', 'coming', 'off', 'Rocky', '4', 'Cobra', 'believe', 'Stallone', 'wanted', 'make', 'Rambo', 'film', 'Middle', 'East', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'were', 'set', 'America', 'Vietnam', 'Rambo', '3', 'Col.', 'Trautman', 'searching', 'Rambo', 'Thailand', 'Trautman', 'stick', 'fighting', 'where', 'Buddhist', 'Temple', 'reason', 'why', 'Trautman', 'pursuing', 'Rambo', 'going', 'Afghanistan', 'help', 'bring', 'supplies', 'weapons', 'Afghan', 'Rebels', 'Rambo', 'not', 'go', 'saying', 'got', 'end', 'sometime', 'Afghanistan', 'Russians', 'capture', 'Trautman', 'team', 'Word', 'back', 'Rambo', 'go', 'rescue', 'mission', 'save', 'Trautman.Overall', 'Rambo', '3', 'better', 'sequel', 'still', 'great', 'story', 'First', 'Blood', 'had']",N/A
