1265254,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B002EIJ8Z4,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[1, 1]","The world was taken by surprise by Michel Jackson's death. We should have known better, because all the symptoms were there -- but they were well-protected. Maybe I'm wrong, but watching ""Michael Jackson: The Trial and Triumph of the King of Pop,"" gives me the impression that this was a work in progress, but Jackson's demise or ""crime"" accelerated the process of finishing it to take advantage of the momentum. And I should say that it was a wise move, because there is information in this documentary that is certainly food for thought - it is worth a view.As the title of this film implies, it takes a favorable view about Michael Jackson and it makes no apologies about it. The material presented covers two areas of the late singer's recent years: the trial and its aftermath. In the first part, Pearl Jr - the host and director - takes us to the trial that took place in Santa Maria, California, in which the singer was accused of child molestation. Although Pearl Jr. was able to get a seat inside the courthouse, she talks to us from outside, where she basically informs us about the circus that took place during those days. She introduces us to a series of characters - most of them plain weird - that had a daily presence outside the courthouse. Many of them were religious fanatics, some were conspiracy theorists, and most were unforgiving fans. During this part of the film, Pearl. Jr. also addresses Jackson's skin condition - Vitiligo --, and interviews experts on this matter. She also briefly talks to some celebrities, including Ashford Simpson, Dorien Wilson, Shemar Moore, and Kanye West, and more. In short, here the host does a great job in showing us what went on outside the court on a daily basis, most of it never seen on regular TV.Before going on with the second part of the documentary - perhaps as a bridge --, Pearl Jr, includes part of a speech given by Geraldine Hughes, talking about her book ""Redemption,"" in which she discusses the trial in detail. We then move to what happened to Michael Jackson after his ""triumph."" The Director does a great job in documenting Jackson's every move after his acquittal from the molestation charges. We learn, for example, that he got tired of life in Neverland, which would later be renamed ""Sycamore Valley Ranch Company, LLC."" He moved to Bahrain, then to Las Vegas, ending in Holmby Hills, where he spent his last days (the film was done before his death). We also see the press conference in London, where he announced his comeback for a series of concerts, in its entirety .This part of the film is more illuminating than the first one, because it is based on facts and not hypotheses -- great footage for any King of Pop fan.Like Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Frank Sinatra, and others, Michael Jackson's life will be dissected in every possible way. ""Michael Jackson: The Trial and Triumph of the King of Pop"" is one more honest and humble effort in putting the puzzle of his interesting and bizarre life together. (USA, 2009, color, 76 min).
