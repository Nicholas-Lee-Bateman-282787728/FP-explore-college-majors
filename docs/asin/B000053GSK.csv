Virtues from honesty to courage to perseverance are personified, rather than preached. The characters play the story straight instead of wholesale slapstick. Sends a clear message of acceptance. It won the kids over, every one. They definitely would watch again. &quot;Funny, crazy, exciting, terrific. Hilarious in places.&quot; Portrayal of hearing-impaired sister impressed them. &quot;Even if you are different you can still do things.&quot; &quot;I want to learn sign language.&quot; Best for ages 8 to 12.",5,The Courage Of Champions,1000684800,"09 17, 2001",2001,574,"['fantastic', 'wonderful', 'story', 'involving', 'feelings', 'attitudes', 'Virtues', 'honesty', 'courage', 'perseverance', 'are', 'personified', 'rather', 'preached', 'characters', 'play', 'story', 'straight', 'instead', 'wholesale', 'slapstick', 'clear', 'message', 'acceptance', 'won', 'kids', 'one', 'definitely', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'quot', 'Funny', 'crazy', 'exciting', 'terrific', 'Hilarious', 'places.', 'quot', 'Portrayal', 'hearing-impaired', 'sister', 'impressed', 'quot', 'Even', 'are', 'different', 'can', 'still', 'do', 'things.', 'quot', 'quot', 'want', 'learn', 'sign', 'language.', 'quot', 'Best', 'ages', '8', '12']",MVP - Most Valuable Primate VHS

But I'm a big Kevin Zegers fan, so I forced myself to watch this.Wow, was I surprised!  No corny chimp humor, and lots of heart! Rather than ""The Barefoot Executive"", this film looked more like ""A Dog From Flanders""!The film is a bit of an Air Bud take-off. But that's good - because like Air Bud, the emphasis is on the people, not just the animal. Kevin, who stars in all three of the Air Bud films, plays another jock, but this time he's a star player from the start. Unlike ""Air Bud 3"", Kevin is featured in lots of hockey scenes, sharing the ice with not only real-life professional hockey players, but even director Robert Vince (you'll see his name credit under ""Hockey Players"")!The DVD features (an older) Kevin in the Production Featurette and in his first-ever (that I know of) feature-length commentary.",4,Chimp film with lots of heart!,980726400,"01 29, 2001",2001,912,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'usually', 'avoid', 'film', 'monkey', 'find', 'intensely', 'dull', 'corny', ""'m"", 'big', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'fan', 'forced', 'watch', 'this.Wow', 'was', 'surprised', 'corny', 'chimp', 'humor', 'lots', 'heart', 'Rather', 'Barefoot', 'Executive', 'film', 'looked', 'more', 'A', 'Dog', 'Flanders', 'film', 'bit', 'Air', 'Bud', 'take-off', 'good', 'Air', 'Bud', 'emphasis', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'animal', 'Kevin', 'who', 'three', 'Air', 'Bud', 'films', 'jock', 'time', 'star', 'player', 'start', 'Air', 'Bud', '3', 'Kevin', 'featured', 'lots', 'hockey', 'scenes', 'sharing', 'ice', 'not', 'only', 'real-life', 'professional', 'hockey', 'players', 'even', 'director', 'Robert', 'Vince', ""'ll"", 'see', 'name', 'credit', 'Hockey', 'Players', 'DVD', 'features', 'older', 'Kevin', 'Production', 'Featurette', 'first-ever', 'know', 'feature-length', 'commentary']",MVP - Most Valuable Primate VHS
564864,A2YSOM1A805PQP,B000053GSK,Todd Gray,"[4, 6]","In the fine tradition of monkey movies comes MVP, Most Valuable Primate. This film only got a limited release here in the states, but in the fine country of Canada it was the number one kids film, and who could blame them for making it so. This film follows the adventures of Jack, a mischeavous little primate that is a wizz at playing hockey. So, what is the worst team in the league going to do, of course, recruit Jack to come in as their ringer and assist them in winning games. This film comes to us from the makers of Air Bud, a fine line of family films, not personally my thing, since they all had a dog, monkeys are the way to go. This film is great for everyone. It has elements that everyone can get into, team work, overcoming adversity, hockey, and of course, a crazy little primate named Jack.",5,"Monkeys, and Hockey!
