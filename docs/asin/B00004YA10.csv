The plot as to what is really going on is very slow in being shown.There was a little more character development in these episodes which was good and alot more action. This series is far from perfect. But it is interesting enough to warrant veiwing.,4,Good but slow,1006300800,"11 21, 2001",2001,320,"['am', 'finding', 'series', 'very', 'interesting', 'have', 'flaws', 'plot', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'very', 'slow', 'being', 'shown.There', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'episodes', 'was', 'good', 'alot', 'more', 'action', 'series', 'far', 'perfect', 'interesting', 'enough', 'warrant', 'veiwing']",N/A

Now however, the TA's have fought in real battle and there has been more action than the first volume- slowly things are coming together.  Volume 3 is when you'll decide if you like the series or not though- There is a lot more action and more character development than the first 2 volumes.  Although Volumes 1 and 2 seem slow, it is important for a basis for the rest of the series so bear through it!  Again, I recommend you rent the first 3 volumes before buying them to decided whether or not you'll like the series.  I really enjoyed this series and it took the first 3 volumes to figure that out.",4,Things are starting to pick up,1013040000,"02 7, 2002",2002,642,"['was', 'similar', 'first', 'volume', 'Now', 'however', 'TA', 'have', 'fought', 'real', 'battle', 'been', 'more', 'action', 'first', 'volume-', 'slowly', 'things', 'are', 'coming', 'together', 'Volume', '3', 'when', ""'ll"", 'decide', 'like', 'series', 'not', 'though-', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'first', '2', 'volumes', 'Volumes', '1', '2', 'seem', 'slow', 'important', 'basis', 'rest', 'series', 'so', 'Again', 'recommend', 'rent', 'first', '3', 'volumes', 'buying', 'decided', 'not', ""'ll"", 'like', 'series', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'took', 'first', '3', 'volumes', 'figure', 'out']",N/A
558798,AJCTGKPXYG8DY,B00004YA10,James Seger,"[0, 0]","Thefirst volume of Gasarakireally surprised me. It was well written and thoughtful, trying to tell a deep story that was more about behind the scenes power plays than robot brawls.This second disc continues to add new wrinkles and complications. The war with Belgistan comes to a close (which surprised me as I thought it was going to run through the entire series) and the JSSDF forces prepare to pull out. We learn about a secret organization calling itself Symbol that was assisting Belgistan, though their motivations for doing so are still clouded.Yushiro causes some commotion when he heads off base and winds up in the middle of a kidnapping. We also see more of the mysterious girl from the first disc that seems to share Yushiro's powers.Very little seems to happen episode by episode. If the disc is watched straight through it is very satisfying viewing, but I can see that if I were watching this half an hour at a time as it was broadcast it would have been tough to follow.",4,Building up steam...,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,987,"['Thefirst', 'volume', 'Gasarakireally', 'surprised', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'thoughtful', 'trying', 'tell', 'deep', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'scenes', 'power', 'plays', 'robot', 'brawls.This', 'second', 'disc', 'add', 'new', 'wrinkles', 'complications', 'war', 'Belgistan', 'close', 'surprised', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'run', 'entire', 'series', 'JSSDF', 'forces', 'prepare', 'pull', 'out', 'learn', 'secret', 'organization', 'calling', 'Symbol', 'was', 'assisting', 'Belgistan', 'motivations', 'doing', 'so', 'are', 'still', 'clouded.Yushiro', 'commotion', 'when', 'base', 'up', 'middle', 'kidnapping', 'also', 'see', 'more', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'first', 'disc', 'share', 'Yushiro', 'powers.Very', 'little', 'happen', 'episode', 'episode', 'disc', 'watched', 'straight', 'very', 'satisfying', 'viewing', 'can', 'see', 'were', 'watching', 'hour', 'time', 'was', 'broadcast', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tough', 'follow']",N/A

Giant robots face giant robots for the 1st time as Yushiro and the girl that haunts his dreams meet on the battlefield. The JSSDF, the UN, the media, and opposing armies are pitted against each other as the puppetmasters of Symbol fan the flames of war into a conflagration that threatens to engulf the world. Something is amiss in Belgistan. It seems that this war was tailor made for some hidden purpose.This volume is much better that the 1st. There is more action and drama. The story is also starting to make more sense . Even though much is still very unclear, this series is pretty intriguing.

Yushiro manages to get back up into his TA, but then a rampid sand storm occurs and the TAs and Fakes draw back. They resume their battle later at an abandoned town in Belgistan. Yushiro gets an even closer encounter with Miharu (a girl who is strikingly similar to Yushro and possess the same powers as he does). The battle is stopped when Tornado Bombers make a pass over the battle and film the battle to show to the world. They then proceed to bomb Belgistan. It appears that Symbol betrayed Belgistan and Belgistan is wiped out of the picture. The JSDF is now in a struggle to get out of Belgistan. However, Yushiro goes wandering off again to find Miharu. He finds her at the stone church of Akura and manage to explain some things. Yushiro and Miharu are soon split up again. Yushiro heads back to Japan and Miharu returns to Symbol's custody. The extras on the DVD are very nice if you like to go in depth on this show. The Japanese dialoge is extremely good and more funnier than the English. Hearing Captain Ataka in Japanese trying to speak English is very funny. Not to mention some jokes about Japanese language. Anyway, dubbed or subbed, either way you view it, its still great. It doesn't have as much action as the first tape, but it still has action and it still is great.

558801,A33HTLHKZ4JSK5,B00004YA10,T. Austin,"[0, 0]","Gasaraki is a futuristic, war-time tale utilizing ""mechas""; or ""Tactical Armor"", as the weapon du jour. Gasaraki is an unfolding type of story whereas plot points are doled out sparingly and new characters are introduced frequently.  Think war epics from the 1960's with dozens of movie stars as an example.It is refreshing to see an anime that strives to be adult in a more geo-political and character driven way rather than by the over use of sex. The writers here worked very hard to create a refreshing storyline that creates a multitude of conflicts rather than focusing on a simple conflict as most animes do.The plots are many encompassing not just the war, the politics, and social interaction but Japanese spiritual themes are included as well.  A heavy use of Shinto religious themes and icons gives the story a mystical edge.The story plays out by immersing the audience into the conflict by showing it from different points of view.  You see this war from the media point of view, such as a ""live CNN-like"" report from the front lines with its grainy footage and color commentary, from the Generals' war room, from within the Tactical Armor itself, and the ""mecha's"" support crew as well.The Character design is very good, especially the hardware though one particular annoying choice the designers made was the use of long hair on a particular ""Tactical Armor"" pilot.  You have a story line here that rarely dissapoints and takes military and political protocol as accurately as it can but a particular T.A. pilot has hair that is way too stylized for the type of detailed story. This could be my particular quirk but it bothered me that his fellow crew and mostly every other soldier had military looking short hair.The english Dub is very good.  Generally speaking the actors did an above average job.  The DVD interface is hassle free though I wish they would of included more extras.A final point that frustrated me about Gasaraki is the animation frame rate.  At times it can be to static or the walk cycles can be choppy.  Obviously the budget was spent on the designers, actors, and director rather than the ""in between artists"".This is a must see anime but don't expect it be flawless, just expect to be entertained.",4,So much to like about Gasaraki yet at times it frustrates,1035936000,"10 30, 2002",2002,2237,"['Gasaraki', 'futuristic', 'war-time', 'tale', 'utilizing', 'mechas', 'Tactical', 'Armor', 'weapon', 'jour', 'Gasaraki', 'unfolding', 'type', 'story', 'whereas', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'doled', 'out', 'sparingly', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'frequently', 'Think', 'war', 'epics', '1960', 'dozens', 'movie', 'stars', 'example.It', 'refreshing', 'see', 'anime', 'be', 'adult', 'more', 'geo-political', 'character', 'driven', 'way', 'rather', 'over', 'use', 'sex', 'writers', 'here', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'create', 'refreshing', 'storyline', 'multitude', 'conflicts', 'rather', 'focusing', 'simple', 'conflict', 'most', 'animes', 'do.The', 'plots', 'are', 'many', 'encompassing', 'not', 'just', 'war', 'politics', 'social', 'interaction', 'Japanese', 'spiritual', 'themes', 'are', 'included', 'well', 'A', 'heavy', 'use', 'Shinto', 'religious', 'themes', 'icons', 'story', 'mystical', 'edge.The', 'story', 'out', 'immersing', 'audience', 'conflict', 'showing', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'see', 'war', 'media', 'point', 'view', 'such', 'live', 'CNN-like', 'report', 'front', 'lines', 'grainy', 'footage', 'color', 'commentary', 'Generals', 'war', 'room', 'Tactical', 'Armor', 'mecha', 'support', 'crew', 'well.The', 'Character', 'design', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'hardware', 'one', 'particular', 'annoying', 'choice', 'designers', 'made', 'was', 'use', 'long', 'hair', 'particular', 'Tactical', 'Armor', 'pilot', 'have', 'story', 'line', 'here', 'rarely', 'dissapoints', 'military', 'political', 'protocol', 'as', 'accurately', 'can', 'particular', 'T.A', 'pilot', 'hair', 'way', 'too', 'stylized', 'type', 'detailed', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'particular', 'quirk', 'bothered', 'fellow', 'crew', 'mostly', 'other', 'soldier', 'had', 'military', 'looking', 'short', 'hair.The', 'english', 'Dub', 'very', 'good', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'actors', 'did', 'above', 'average', 'job', 'DVD', 'interface', 'hassle', 'free', 'wish', 'would', 'included', 'more', 'extras.A', 'final', 'point', 'frustrated', 'Gasaraki', 'animation', 'frame', 'rate', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'static', 'walk', 'cycles', 'can', 'be', 'choppy', 'Obviously', 'budget', 'was', 'spent', 'designers', 'actors', 'director', 'rather', 'artists', '.This', 'must', 'see', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'flawless', 'just', 'expect', 'be', 'entertained']",N/A

The storyline and character development are in-line with quality of other great anime titles like Macross. The animation is very good, excellent for an on-going series. The story is the most original of it's type since Macross, due to the overpopulated anime world of mechs. The characters are not cute little furrys and strange looking bug eyed types of alot of anime, but more in tone with mature audiences, characters you can relate to more than just emotionally but physically. The mechs for instance aren't as anime as Macross in that they are more like Metal Gear, military types with restrictions on what they can do. They are not skyscraper size yet agile, they are machines, extensions of the pilots as if they were real. They are under more real physics than alot of other mechs in anime, they actually malfunction when they get clogged with sand in the desert in this particular volume.
