568811,A3CSRP3P4U9HI,B000056BP2,Alan R. Holyoak,"[7, 15]","&quot;God's Army&quot; uses the full-time missionary program of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as the pretext for the movie's storyline.  In the movie a new missionary, Elder Allen, arrives alone in Los Angelos, CA.The acting in the movie is average, the storyline is not especially compelling, and, in many respects, this movie does not accurately reflect full-time service of missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  For those reasons I awarded this movie the 3-star rating.In the movie, Elder Allen meets the mission president.  He then meets his companion, and four other missionaries with whom he shares an apartment.  Those six missionaries and their experiences are, at best, composites of many of the more extreme experiences missionaries may have had.  During the course of the movie Elder Allen goes through his own journey of faith.It is true that there are some missionaries that reflect some of the attitudes and actions depicted, but the missionaries depicted in the movie are not, again, in my opinion, examples of the vast majority of missionaries.Criticisms of the movie include the following:1) New missionaries seldom if ever travel without a companion to their assigned field of labor (there is almost always a group leaving a mission at the same time that a group arrives in a mission). 2) The filming of blessings and baptisms (even by actors) is not encouraged by the Church. 3) Baptisms would not be authorized to be performed in the ocean when a Church meetinghouse is in the area -- as they certainly are in the greater LA area. 4) I seriously doubt that any mission president would treat a new missionary the way Elder Allen was treated in his first interview with his mission president. 5) The movie showed more apartment horseplay and less work being done than any missionary would actually do.All in all, this movie is a mediocre representation of life as a full-time LDS missionary.  Again, some aspects of the movie are accurate (morning personal and companion study time, lights out at night, etc.), others are questionable (practical jokes, general sophomoric pranks, etc.).I do not recommend that prospective missionaries view this video with the idea that it will give them an idea of what missionary life and missionary service will be like.  My review is based on personal experience, I served as a full-time missionary from 1978-80.I hope this review was helpful to you.

568812,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000056BP2,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[6, 8]","Writer/director Richard Dutcher's films are small masterpieces made on shoestring budgets and limited time, that have themes that will deeply touch anyone on a spiritual journey no matter what their particular denomination or faith. ""God's Army"" is about Mormon missionaries in Los Angeles, and reflects Dutcher's personal experience as a missionary in southern Mexico and has a wide range of emotions. It will make you roar with laughter, or cry with the beauty and tragedy of other scenes, and eventually will encourage you to reflect on the state of your own soul. Dutcher doesn't make one shot viewing movies. His films stick to your ribs like a good meal and stay inside your head. Don't rent them, buy them. You'll be watching them for many years to come, again and again.""God's Army"" cost $300,000 and was filmed in 18 days, incredible by Hollywood standards. The script is a marvel, and makes the characters come alive. Also a superb actor, Dutcher stars as Elder ""Pops"" Dalton, and as Brandon Allen, the new missionary with a troubled past, Matthew Brown, with his expressive, handsome face, gives an exquisite performance. The entire cast is good, and includes DeSean Terry, marvelous as Elder Banks, John Pentecost, Jacque Gray and Michael Buster. The extras in this terrific 2 disc set are voluminous, and include 2 audio commentaries on the 1st disc, and deleted scenes, outtakes (the ocean baptism outtakes are hilarious), a ""making of"" featurette, and more on the 2nd disc. It even includes 7 frames of the original film in a little clear baggie, as a nice souvenir.In one choice scene, Elder Banks says to Elder Allen: ""Sometimes I think God does it on purpose...He gives you 100 reasons to believe, and then He just drops one or two for you not to believe, so that you can choose to see if you really want to believe."" Few films have depicted the struggle of faith as well as ""God's Army.""Dutcher followed this film with the award winning ""Brigham City,"" a crime drama with a spiritual core that also stars Dutcher and Brown. It's a very special film and another big favorite of mine, and then he made ""States of Grace,"" which is somewhat of a sequel to ""God's Army,"" and not to be missed. I love Richard Dutcher. I love his talent, his heart, and his faith (since this film was made he has left the LDS church, as stated on his web site over ""theological differences"").

I was surprised to see how much of this movie is just them sitting around doing nothing.Any true Mormon missionary knows that the best of these guys would be nothing short of a disgrace in real life.  Richard Dutcher has made a mockery out of a serious thing, and for what?  If he wanted to promote the Mormon church, is this the way to do it?

The movie did cause me to feel sorry that I did not go on an L.D.S. mission.  It would have been a highly charitable as well as rewarding experience. I found the movie's title somewhat offensive, as well as the liberal use of our sacred prayers (baptism, healing and annointing of the sick).  These prayers were accurate however, and something which we as church members should not feel ashamed of.  This movie may or may not have been sanctioned by the general authorites of the church, but I feel that it was an excellent representation of missionary work.  Many of my returned missionary friends have told me of much more horse-play than what was portrayed in this movie.  You must remember, these are only nineteen year old boys, or twenty-one year old girls, in most cases.  I'm sure that a lot of child-like behavior is very common.

I was surprised at the Mission President's profoundness and wisdom. 2. Missionary work is a turning point in a young man's life. The mission combines tough and rigerous spiritual discipline and mental preparation. This is two years of total devotion to a cause. A Elder learns what commitment and hard work mean. The mission field is a battle field where the valiant distinquish themselve. 3. I liked how the director protrayed missionaries as caring servants. The blessing of the sick and spiritually deprived brought back many memories serving in Anaheim California. I empathized with the story line and found it interesting. 4. The friendship between Pops and Elder Allen seemed genuine. The story line created alot of respect between the two characters. 5. I liked the spiritual journey of Elder Allen, it demonstrated compassion, humility, and faith.Criticisms of the movie1. Baptisms are done in an LDS chapels with a Bishop or counselor presiding 2. Blessings are sacred not secret. I personally was uncomfortable about these scenes dispite the directors accuracy. 3. As a missionary, who served under one of the greatest mission presidents, former Rick's football coach and MTC president; I doubt any new Elder would have been treated so poorly. Mission presidents build up their Elders and assign them with trustworthy and proven Elders for training. 4. There's a mixture of horseplay and seriousness in the mission field. I'll say it was the hardest but funnest work, I've every done. Missionaries must uphold the highest image and reputation for the Church they represent. 5. Not every missionary finds their future wife in the mission field. 6. An Elder would never flirt with the Mission President's wife. This idea was offensive.

It should be known that I am not a Mormon so I hoped folks out there don't think I am bit prejudice against the film based on faith.Having wrote that, I would say that this movie proves to be very clumsily made. Its clear that a novice director is at work here, the editing isn't very strong and scenes seem to be cut piece parts that seem to be string together to make a whole. Its tell the story but it looked bit cheap.The strong point of the movie proves to be the acting although I thought Richard Dutcher's role seem to be the weakest, maybe the director/actor isn't used to playing both roles yet. Scenes without him seem to be stronger then the scenes with him. Ironically, the movie centered around Dutcher's character and the effects he had on Matthew Brown's character who was losing his faith.The movie also suffered from bad script, which also seem to be cut pieces string along to make a story. At times, it seem to skip a scene or two although I am not sure, it sure felt that way. The end scene where Brown' character met up and married the girl he met on the mission is a classical example of ""make a wish"" script writing. The entire sequence would have more meaning and impact if there was some sort of mutual chemisty and feeling between the two characters during their time in Los Angles but most of the movie shown them no more then just casual friends.Obviously, this is a type of movie that can only pleased one narrow audience, the members of the LDS and even some of them it seem from the reviews, were not pleased. Non-members would probably find this movie bit overblown, preachy and bit one dimensional in nature. You might say that this movie is basically a LDS movie for the LDS members.

My sense is that Mormon viewers might enjoy the story more, because they can fully relate to the characters--with great empathy.  The inner struggles of the missionaries seem true and realistic.  I was particularly intrigued that one of them left the field, and probably the church, after seriously contemplating the claims of critiques of the faith.  The anti-Mormon books were presumably written by either ex-Mormons or fundamental Christians.The strongest aspect of God's Army was the the coming-of-age transformation that is naturally intensified by missionary experiences. Though different in tone, the young idealist-turned tentative skeptic-transformed to true and confident missionary parallels the experiences portrayed in The Other Side of Heaven.The weakest aspect of the film is the narrow audience focus.  Unlike the Other Side of Heaven, which details experiences missionaries of any faith might experience, God's Army is strictly Mormon in flavor.  Non-LDS viewers might garner mild interest in what drives those well-dressed teenagers that sometimes appear at our doors, but otherwise, the film seems meant for Mormon youth meetings as discussion material.Bottom-line:  A well-acted and plausible story, but meant primarily for Mormon young people and those who care about them.",3,"Mormon Viewers might give 5-stars, Others may not care",1085788800,"05 29, 2004",2004,1464,"['non-Mormon', 'viewer', 'who', 'been', 'missionary', 'own', 'faith', 'tradition', 'came', 'movie', 'recommendations', 'viewers', 'Other', 'Side', 'Heaven', 'sense', 'Mormon', 'viewers', 'might', 'enjoy', 'story', 'more', 'can', 'fully', 'relate', 'characters', 'great', 'empathy', 'inner', 'struggles', 'missionaries', 'seem', 'true', 'realistic', 'was', 'particularly', 'intrigued', 'one', 'left', 'field', 'probably', 'church', 'seriously', 'contemplating', 'claims', 'critiques', 'faith', 'anti-Mormon', 'books', 'were', 'presumably', 'written', 'ex-Mormons', 'fundamental', 'Christians.The', 'strongest', 'aspect', 'God', 'Army', 'was', 'coming-of-age', 'transformation', 'naturally', 'intensified', 'missionary', 'experiences', 'different', 'tone', 'young', 'idealist-turned', 'tentative', 'skeptic-transformed', 'true', 'confident', 'missionary', 'parallels', 'experiences', 'portrayed', 'Other', 'Side', 'Heaven.The', 'weakest', 'aspect', 'film', 'narrow', 'audience', 'focus', 'Other', 'Side', 'Heaven', 'details', 'missionaries', 'faith', 'might', 'experience', 'God', 'Army', 'strictly', 'Mormon', 'flavor', 'Non-LDS', 'viewers', 'might', 'garner', 'mild', 'interest', 'what', 'well-dressed', 'teenagers', 'sometimes', 'appear', 'doors', 'otherwise', 'film', 'meant', 'Mormon', 'youth', 'meetings', 'discussion', 'material.Bottom-line', 'well-acted', 'plausible', 'story', 'meant', 'primarily', 'Mormon', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'care']",God's Army

Smith,"[2, 4]","Up to this point Mormons seem to have been universially unable to accurately express why their mission was the single most defining time in their lives. There have been several attempts ranging from the saccharine-like tales of Jack Weyland to the more confrontational &quot;Fires of the Mind.&quot; The task is difficult because it involves conflict and resolution in many different dimensions: spiritual, physical, intellectual, and emotional. God's Army comes the closest to explaining why a Mormon mission becomes a pivotal point in one's life.Here the writer/director takes a little literary license. Whereas in real life the conflicts usually come as one proselytes, in this film problems arise mostly from the interactions of the other district missionaries. This district is populated by all the classic archtypes: the elder who is extremely sick, but won't let them send him home; the worldly elder; the elder whose family are all outside the church; the &quot;intellectual&quot; elder; the elder and sister who meet and get married after their mission; the straight-lace elder who has all the right habits; and so on. I saw many of these types, but never in the same district.Not just the &quot;types,&quot; but the actions seem very familiar: the pranks (even the slightly gross ones), the fighting, the elder who leaves the church, the elder who dies, and the discouragement.But you also see the fruits of this labor: the people who are touched by the spirit, the baptisms, the spiritual growth experenced by elders and contacts. This also rings true to someone who has served a mission.There are some things protrayed in this film that seem a bit harsh, such as the &quot;Mission President Interview,&quot; but I took this as an attempt to increase the conflict aspect of this story. There are some things that are a bit unrealistic, such as the &quot;Baptism in the Ocean,&quot; but I interpreted this as an attempt to make the &quot;success&quot; even more ideal.The one thing this film wasn't able to capture was the utter monotony, the day in and day out experiences. But I consider that to be an issue dealing with the medium, not the writer/director.Basically I feel that this is the best attempt, up to this point, to explain why a Mormon Mission is so important in so many lives.",5,Passing Through the Fire,991785600,"06 6, 2001",2001,2300,"['Up', 'point', 'Mormons', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'universially', 'unable', 'accurately', 'express', 'why', 'mission', 'was', 'single', 'most', 'defining', 'time', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'attempts', 'ranging', 'saccharine-like', 'tales', 'Jack', 'Weyland', 'more', 'confrontational', 'quot', 'Fires', 'Mind.', 'quot', 'task', 'difficult', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'many', 'different', 'dimensions', 'spiritual', 'physical', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'God', 'Army', 'closest', 'explaining', 'why', 'Mormon', 'mission', 'pivotal', 'point', 'one', 'writer/director', 'little', 'literary', 'license', 'Whereas', 'real', 'life', 'conflicts', 'usually', 'come', 'one', 'film', 'problems', 'arise', 'mostly', 'interactions', 'other', 'district', 'missionaries', 'district', 'populated', 'classic', 'archtypes', 'elder', 'who', 'extremely', 'sick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'send', 'home', 'worldly', 'elder', 'elder', 'family', 'are', 'church', 'quot', 'intellectual', 'quot', 'elder', 'sister', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'mission', 'straight-lace', 'elder', 'who', 'right', 'habits', 'so', 'saw', 'many', 'types', 'never', 'same', 'district.Not', 'just', 'quot', 'types', 'quot', 'actions', 'seem', 'very', 'familiar', 'pranks', 'even', 'slightly', 'gross', 'ones', 'fighting', 'elder', 'who', 'church', 'elder', 'who', 'discouragement.But', 'also', 'see', 'fruits', 'labor', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'touched', 'spirit', 'baptisms', 'spiritual', 'growth', 'experenced', 'elders', 'contacts', 'also', 'true', 'someone', 'who', 'served', 'mission.There', 'are', 'things', 'protrayed', 'film', 'seem', 'bit', 'harsh', 'such', 'quot', 'Mission', 'President', 'Interview', 'quot', 'took', 'attempt', 'increase', 'conflict', 'aspect', 'story', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'such', 'quot', 'Baptism', 'Ocean', 'quot', 'interpreted', 'attempt', 'make', 'quot', 'success', 'quot', 'even', 'more', 'ideal.The', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'capture', 'was', 'utter', 'monotony', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'experiences', 'consider', 'be', 'issue', 'dealing', 'medium', 'not', 'writer/director.Basically', 'feel', 'best', 'attempt', 'up', 'point', 'explain', 'why', 'Mormon', 'Mission', 'so', 'important', 'so', 'many', 'lives']",God's Army
