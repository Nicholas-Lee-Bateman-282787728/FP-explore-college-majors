It is here that he meets an elder scholar, who helps him to escape and lends him a powerful amulet to ward away evil. Back on the road, Ning encounters a wandering monk, and the two must join forces to defeat a forest demon that infiltrates their camp. Fate intervenes once again, as the two are apprehended by a roving band of rebels led by Windy, a beautiful warrior that resembles his lost love. This time, Ning is confused for the Elder Chu, owner of the amulet, and asked to lead the group against an evil priest who has sentenced Windy's father to death and put a spell over the entire empire!Tsui Hark and Ching Siu-Tung return with the next exciting chapter of A CHINESE GHOST STORY! Hark makes every attempt to outdo the incredible special effects from the first film, and succeeds! A CHINESE GHOST STORY 2 puts on a dazzling display of monsters, magic, and martial arts once again. While the plot isn't quite as compelling as the last, it features many favorite characters and more of the same great humor that originally brought them to life. Leslie Cheung and Joey Wang easily resume their chemistry on screen, but newcomer Jacky Cheung quickly steals the spotlight as the Taoist mage Autumn with his lively performance. A CHINESE GHOST STORY 2 is another excellent entry in the fantasy horror saga.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,A Chinese Ghost Story 2,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,1510,"['freeing', 'spirit', 'ghostly', 'love', 'Hsiao-Tsing', 'Ning', 'home', 'find', 'village', 'ruin', 'where', 'falsely', 'imprisoned', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'here', 'elder', 'scholar', 'who', 'escape', 'powerful', 'amulet', 'ward', 'away', 'evil', 'Back', 'road', 'Ning', 'encounters', 'wandering', 'monk', 'two', 'must', 'join', 'forces', 'defeat', 'forest', 'demon', 'camp', 'Fate', 'intervenes', 'once', 'again', 'two', 'are', 'apprehended', 'roving', 'band', 'rebels', 'led', 'Windy', 'beautiful', 'warrior', 'lost', 'love', 'time', 'Ning', 'confused', 'Elder', 'Chu', 'owner', 'amulet', 'asked', 'lead', 'group', 'evil', 'priest', 'who', 'sentenced', 'Windy', 'father', 'death', 'put', 'spell', 'entire', 'empire', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'Ching', 'Siu-Tung', 'return', 'next', 'exciting', 'chapter', 'A', 'CHINESE', 'GHOST', 'STORY', 'Hark', 'attempt', 'outdo', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'first', 'film', 'CHINESE', 'GHOST', 'STORY', '2', 'puts', 'dazzling', 'display', 'monsters', 'magic', 'martial', 'arts', 'once', 'again', 'plot', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'compelling', 'last', 'many', 'favorite', 'characters', 'more', 'same', 'great', 'humor', 'originally', 'brought', 'life', 'Leslie', 'Cheung', 'Joey', 'Wang', 'easily', 'resume', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'newcomer', 'Jacky', 'Cheung', 'quickly', 'spotlight', 'Taoist', 'mage', 'Autumn', 'lively', 'performance', 'CHINESE', 'GHOST', 'STORY', '2', 'excellent', 'entry', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'saga.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",A Chinese Ghost Story III
444511,A11GO5VA74HD8K,6305020892,Crazy Fox,"[3, 3]","This is a great movie that I never get tired of watching. Supposedly it is a sequel that take place a hundred years after the events of the first two movies, but in reality it is more like the cinematic equivalent of a remix of the first movie (same basic storyline with elaborations, same actress playing the heroine, similar character types, and so on). And like the first one, it manages the great alchemical mix of genres and moods: romantic and creepy, action-packed and humorous, haunting and light-hearted. But it succeeds in upping these a notch. The romantic relationship between the hero and the ghostly heroine is complicated and given tension by his being a monk (monastic vows and all) and by her being less overtly benign. The special effects are way, way, way better (which is partly due to the passage of time, of course), and these contribute to the choreography of the action...the part where the senior monk detects the presence of evil and abruptly shoots up from his meditation seat into the air and starts gliding about doing reconnaissance is totally cool no matter how many times I see it. And to top it all off, even the subtitles are better.Also intensified are the religious motifs and themes, obviously, and while Buddhism and Taoism come out as more distinct in this version, the manner in which they are both portrayed in the popular imagination is again fascinating and intriguing in its own right. Anyone who studies East Asian Buddhism could find a lot of food for thought here...and have a great time doing so, to boot.So don't deprive yourself of this wonderful, entertaining adventure.

His master is also very cool in this movie. There was not much tongue killing in this movie which helps it. I also feel the romance is much better in this film.

444513,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,6305020892,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 6]","I was prepared to really enjoy Chinese Ghost Story III, understanding that it was essentially a retread of the original two movies. Since the movie takes place 100 years after the second, there's plenty of good reasons for why the Chinese Ghost Story III would be disconnected from its roots.Unfortunately, Chinese Ghost Story III suffers from exactly the opposite: it's far too much like Chinese Ghost Story II. Even more unforgivable, the actress who played the ghost in the first story (that was saved, to become reincarnated) and who played the physical twin of the ghost in the second story, is ANOTHER ghost in this story. Another ghost, but not the same ghost. Very annoying.Back too is the villain, the wicked tree hag with the neverending tongue and influence over tree branches. I don't know about you, but I didn't have a burning desire to find out whatever happened to the tree hag that dove into that hole in the second movie. I mean, really.The plot is similar - instead of a tax collector seduced by a ghost, we have a monk seduced by a ghost. There's an old mentor who has supernatural powers and there's also a professional demon hunter. The only difference is that the demon hunter in this movie was the student of the old monk in the last movie.So what does this movie have to offer? Not much. In fact, it's so much like the second movie that the parallels only serve to show just how inferior the second movie is. It's not as scary, not as funny, and not as romantic.The ending even has a poorly introduced bad guy - the husband to be to the ghost (JUST LIKE THE SECOND MOVIE). In this case, it's the &quot;Mountain Devil.&quot; The Mountain Devil is apparently a big puppet, and not in the &quot;hey it's cool cause it's wacky&quot; kind of way. He animates buildings that look like puppet buildings.On the whack-I-meter, the old monk manages to cover his eyes with his earlobes. And that's about it. Even the sword stunts and magic tricks can't top Chinese Ghost Story II.If you've seen the second movie, you don't need to see Chinese Ghost Story III.",3,"If you've seen CGSII, you don't need to see this movie.",1081209600,"04 6, 2004",2004,2073,"['was', 'prepared', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Chinese', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'III', 'understanding', 'was', 'essentially', 'retread', 'original', 'two', 'movies', 'movie', 'place', '100', 'years', 'second', 'plenty', 'good', 'reasons', 'why', 'Chinese', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'III', 'would', 'be', 'disconnected', 'roots.Unfortunately', 'Chinese', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'III', 'suffers', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Chinese', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'II', 'Even', 'more', 'unforgivable', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'ghost', 'first', 'story', 'was', 'saved', 'become', 'reincarnated', 'who', 'played', 'physical', 'twin', 'ghost', 'second', 'story', 'ANOTHER', 'ghost', 'story', 'ghost', 'not', 'same', 'ghost', 'Very', 'annoying.Back', 'too', 'villain', 'wicked', 'tree', 'hag', 'neverending', 'tongue', 'influence', 'tree', 'branches', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'burning', 'desire', 'find', 'out', 'happened', 'tree', 'hag', 'dove', 'hole', 'second', 'movie', 'mean', 'really.The', 'plot', 'similar', 'instead', 'tax', 'collector', 'seduced', 'ghost', 'have', 'monk', 'seduced', 'ghost', 'old', 'mentor', 'who', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'also', 'professional', 'demon', 'hunter', 'only', 'difference', 'demon', 'hunter', 'movie', 'was', 'student', 'old', 'monk', 'last', 'movie.So', 'what', 'movie', 'have', 'offer', 'Not', 'much', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'second', 'movie', 'parallels', 'only', 'serve', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'inferior', 'second', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'romantic.The', 'ending', 'even', 'poorly', 'introduced', 'bad', 'guy', 'husband', 'be', 'ghost', 'JUST', 'LIKE', 'THE', 'SECOND', 'MOVIE', 'case', 'quot', 'Mountain', 'Devil.', 'quot', 'Mountain', 'Devil', 'apparently', 'big', 'puppet', 'not', 'quot', 'cool', 'cause', 'wacky', 'quot', 'kind', 'way', 'buildings', 'look', 'puppet', 'whack-I-meter', 'old', 'monk', 'cover', 'eyes', 'earlobes', 'Even', 'sword', 'stunts', 'magic', 'tricks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'top', 'Chinese', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'II.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'second', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'Chinese', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'III']",A Chinese Ghost Story III

I don't know what they were thinking with part 2 but part 3 is the sequel I was looking for.  Once again her job as a ghost is to seduce men so that her evil master can eat their spirits.Tong Leung (fromHard Boiled) plays a Buddhist monk who is on a journey with his master to deliver a golden Buddha.  They get attacked by Joey Wong's evil master and Joey Wong tries to save Tony Leung from the demon.  Even though Tony is a Buddhist he can't hide his love for the ghost.Jacky Cheung makes a welcome return after starring in part 2, and he helps Tony Leung retrieve his golden Buddha after it was stolen.  Tony Leung's master has been captured by the demon and Tony is supposed to repair the Golden Buddha and then come back to save his master.  Instead he gets it stolen and it ends up getting melted into a blob instead of a Buddha.  He doesn't know if the Buddha will still have its magical powers but he has to go and save his master.  Luckily Jacky Cheung comes along to help him for a very exciting ending.The relationship between Tony Leung and Joey wong is just as beautiful as the relationship that Joey Wong had with Leslie Cheung.  There is a lot more comedy than parts 1 and 2 and also a lot of great one-liners.  The biggest difference is that this movie is just completely insane.  Tongues go into peoples stomachs, the evil demon is some sort of crazy tree monster, and there are some epic magic battles.  Fun doesn't even begin to describe it.
