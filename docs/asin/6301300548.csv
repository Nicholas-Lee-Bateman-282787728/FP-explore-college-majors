249259,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6301300548,Douglas Doepke,"[12, 12]","Psychological horror at its best. No one who's seen The Other goes away unimpressed. As other reviews indicate, the movie has developed a strong cult following and deservedly so.  Like so many low-key gems, this one too would likely fade into oblivion were it not for VHS and the internet, which can now build an audience from the grass-roots up. And this obscure little movie certainly merits  revival.Director Mulligan worked against convention, filming his classic in bright open sunlight, instead of the creepy shadow and low-key stage lighting dictated by Gothic tradition. But the style works, thanks to a fluid and highly intelligent camera. Watch the opening scene, as the slow pan meanders its way toward the solitary boy revealed finally in dreamy soft focus. This reverie sets the perfect psychological tone for the story and is key to the over-arching plot device. There are other moments of slow, silent pans that lend both atmosphere and creepy suspense, and I particularly like the way Mulligan stays with Niles' little world in spellbinding fashion. That way, the surrounding mayhem is only glimpsed and  not belabored, allowing our imagination room to take over. For fans of the genre, his technique is reminiscent of Peter Weir's 1970's co-classic, Picnic at Hanging Rock.Horror films rarely rely on acting for their impact. This one, however -- as other reviewers point out -- is a rarity. The performances are first-rate, particularly the astonishingly fine turn by the Udvarnoky twins. Chris who plays Niles achieves a naturalness and spontaneity that is itself almost scary. I don't think I've ever seen a farm boy portrayed more convincingly, nor has boyish exuberance been more expertly conveyed than in his spirited gallop to wherever he's going -- which makes the main plot device all the more sinister. Then too, there's Diana Muldaur's agonizing portrayal of the  mother. It is only through her stricken eyes that the audience comes to realize the enormity of what's happening, while the shot of her wraith-like face framed by a dirty window pane is enough to haunt many a sleepless night. Moreover, the bustling farm family, always busy wth this and that, appears straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting.Yes, the story unfolds in a complex manner, placing a bit of a burden on the audience. And there are a few holes, as when the elderly neighbor calls the magician Holland instead of Niles -- presumably she's close enough to the household to know better. Nonetheless, there's not an ounce of fat on Tom Tryon's screenplay, while the scattered parts come convincingly together by movie's close. For those fans max'ed out on slasher-gore and blood-fest, this exercise in implied horror is the perfect antidote -- and a worthy addition to the legendary tradition of Nosferatu, Vampyr, and Val Lewton's imaginative 1940's cycle of Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, and The Seventh Victim.

249260,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,6301300548,Draconis Blackthorne,"[3, 4]","[This review contains 'spoilers']Set in rural, provencial New England in the early 20th century, The Other is one of those ""evil child"" films in which a veritable ""evil twin"" scenario unfolds when one of the two Perry brothers perishes at the bottom of a well. The very apparent subconscious ghost of 'Holland' takes root in Niles' schizophrenic mind, wherein he deals with his grief by externalizing his dead brother as a mischievous split personality influence, thus committing various gruesome murders. To Niles, his brother is very real in his subjective reality, with all the blame transferred onto him, the ""other"". A definite mental dissociation.One by one, the country folk in this small township begin experiencing a series of mysterious deaths, with no one the wiser that it could possibly be this very clever innocent-looking child, and thus, the events continue to unfold.Victims include his very own parents, an obnoxious whining playmate, a musical old lady, and perhaps most disturbingly, even a new-born baby: Dad ""trips"" and falls into the barn cellar; after discovering and confiscating a secret item, Mom tumbles down a flight of stairs but survives with paralysis; a tattle-telling boy is impaled on a conveniently-placed pitchfork while jumping into a hay bale playing ""King of The Mountain"", even though he was forbidden to romp therein; Mrs. Rowe is quite literally frightened to death {her phobia is exploited}; probably feeling all the attention he craved was being diverted, the new-born baby goes missing one stormy night only to meet a tragic fate, while shifting the blame onto a local farmhand. In each case, it became an exaggerated matter of revenge wherein his 'evil twin' felt justified to finalize.Throughout the film, Niles is counselled by the wise and kind Ada about his special gifts, a gypsy-grandmother type who teaches him to practice mental projection via visualization, wherein he travels into the perspective of a raven, flying forth across the land wherein he actually prognosticates the demise of the pestiferous boy. Learning of his nefarious 'Holland' alter-ego, she tries to provide grounding through asserting his death by admonishing him to 'view' his brother at the grave in the coffin, but it proves too much for his mind's eye, and so she assents. She eventually learns the extent of his deeds, blames herself, and thereby takes it upon herself to rid the town of them both.Besides the deaths, other notable scenes include a trip to the carnival, wherein he witnesses various 'freaks', and the shenanigans of an illusionist 'disappearing' for the crowd.For a horror movie, the film uses atypical wholesome-like common-day settings as a stage, instead of standard nightmarish props, effects, characters, or environments, seemingly stating that the likelihood of such occurrences could unexpectedly happen any where at any time, even in the most day-lit or misperceived 'safe' circumstances.

L'hoir,"[2, 2]","This film, which I first saw on the large screen in the 'seventies, is one of a rash of tales of the bizarre that emerged, it seems to me, with ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) and was followed by ""The Omen,"" ""Harvest Home,"" and the ""The Exorcist,"" among others (They were perhaps intended to take the public's minds off of the madness of the 'sixties, including several nasty wars, student protests, and the energy crunch). To me, ""The Other"" surpasses its contemporary fright-flicks, for two principal reasons: acting and cinematography.The acting honours go primarily to Uta Hagen, the phenomenal actress of the Broadway theatre, who plays the grandmother of the twins with sincerity and grace. Her performance, which is truly moving, lifts what might have been a good but run-of-the-mill horror film into the realm of the extraordinary. Similarly, the casting of the twins (Chris and Martin Udvarnoky) was inspired. These were no smart-alec Hollywood brats; instead, they were natural, believable boys, who are consequently convincing in their roles. Their personas of normality, in fact, contribute immensely to the eerie atmosphere of the film.The cinematography is especially to be commended. The apparent normalcy of the setting initially reassures the viewer, who becomes gradually unsettled and--almost unawares--chilled, as the tale of horror unfolds. The pastoral setting of New England of the 1930s exudes tranquility--fields of alfalfa, whitewashed fences, sunflowers tilting against an old red barn--a feeling of comfort that is increasingly disturbed by nightmarish visions: birds of ill-omen, dark root-cellars, and upturned pitchforks. The old-fashioned iron rooster weathervane, which at first conveyed a sense of rural wellbeing, whirls violently in the hurricane that ravages the landscape.""The Other,"" the script of which was written by the author of the novel, Thomas Tryon, accomplishes most of the horror offstage, as it were; the film was produced in an era when it was thought unnecessary to drench the audience in blood and guts. Therefore, it will probably not be appreciated by viewers who enjoy the in-your-face genre of horror films. But for those who appreciate the subtleties of suggestion, ""The Other"" represents a rich--if macabre--feast for the imagination.P.S. Do not read the blurb on the back of the DVD--as another viewer has suggested--or watch the trailers before you watch the film. They give the entire show away. Do, however, read Mr Tryon's novel afterwards, if the book is available.

249265,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,6301300548,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[8, 12]","This film holds up well in the decades since its release. It was filmed boldly in color, and yet director Robert Mulligan still maintained the ""feel"" of the Depression in 1935 Connecticut. This was a world he perfected in 1962 with his classic film, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. The script by Tom Tryon, from his own novel, was fraught with challenges for the minds and hearts of the viewers.Twins Chris and Martin Udvarnoky were perfectly cast as twins Niles and Holland Perry. They had been discovered doing plays for Herbert Berghof, who just happened to be married to Uta Hagen. This movie was the only film work the twins ever did. They just seemed to drop out of sight afterward, heightening the reality of their performances. When I first saw this film in a theatre in 1972, I bought the extant twins premise. It was skillfully handled visually by Mulligan. I was strung along until midway when Uta Hagen, as the grandmother Ada Perry, revealed to the young Niles that his ""bad"" brother, Holland, had been dead for a year.The movie worked on two levels successfully. There was a sun-kissed rural 1930's heartland, a kid's woodland paradise, on the one hand; great spans of forest and field, old barns, and dark mysterious cellars. Juxtaposed to that, overlapping and intermeshing with that, we discovered a Gothic plot; complete with a doomed family haunted by dark psychic powers, whose family crest was a peregrine falcon, for their name Perry, emblazoned on an heirloom ring, and on the creaking weathervane high atop the Victorian style house. Murder stalked the Perry farm, and spread out to the neighbors; murder disguised as accident.Mulligan orchestrated wonderful touching moments between Uta Hagen and young Chris as Niles...loving moments whereby a blue-eyed angelic tow-headed child adored his wise and spirtually advanced grandmother. Much was made of the special psychic games they played, with Niles projecting his mind, and perhaps even his essence, into things and others; guessing the sex of his sister's unborn child, and even projecting into a crow, able to cognizantly fly freely over the farmlands cawing greetings to all it recognized. This was a game that Niles was so adept at, had perfected so well, that he had no difficulty dealing with his own split personality, and embracing a form of complete denial at to his brother's actual death, and further denial as to his own responsiblity for conducting divers heinous acts in the guise of, or as Holland. So Niles never had to be alone, would not accept being alone.Diana Muldaur, as the mother Alexandra, was simply wonderful as the archetypical Gothic doomed heroine; beautiful, vulnerable, descending into madness and darkness and near catatonia. Her meager attempts to regain some emotional balance, to recapture the light, were soon dashed by the evil actions and reactions of Niles, who seemed to love her and loathe her, and definitely wished her harm.Uta Hagen, a great actress of the Theatre, completed only three films, and a slew of television roles. In this one, she was very effective as a kind of Maria Ouspenskaya mid-European matriarch, with some kind of a dark past, and considerable psychic abilities. She radiated love for her entire doomed family, and riddled with guilt for her part in the machinations of plot, she was willing to sacrifice, to martyr herself in order to stop the killings. It was a kinky and delicious twist that her sacrifice was to no avail.Victor French gave a fine performance in the small role of the farm handyman, Mr. Angelini [nice symbolism]. He did well with is brief scenes, illustrating the frustration and lonliness of an emigrant in America during the Depression; a man descended into drunkeness as a panacea or refuge; only to find himself dragged from his enebriated sweaty slumber and accused of murdering an infant; ala the Lindburgh case of that era. We witnessed racial prejudice and insane mob rule as the family and the authorities leaped headlong to incorrect conclusions. John Ritter was adequate in the likewise small role of Rider, the son-in-law living in the Perry household. It was a tiny part, but it hinted at Ritter's future talents.The ironic ending reasonated with all the significant chords of a horror contata. At the fade, one wondered who would be next on the adolescent death list?  Mulligan struck gold mining Tryon's dark tale.",4,Gothic Heartland,1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,4383,"['film', 'up', 'well', 'decades', 'release', 'was', 'filmed', 'boldly', 'color', 'yet', 'director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'still', 'maintained', 'feel', 'Depression', '1935', 'Connecticut', 'was', 'world', 'perfected', '1962', 'classic', 'film', 'TO', 'KILL', 'A', 'MOCKINGBIRD', 'script', 'Tom', 'Tryon', 'own', 'novel', 'was', 'fraught', 'challenges', 'minds', 'hearts', 'viewers.Twins', 'Chris', 'Martin', 'Udvarnoky', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'twins', 'Niles', 'Holland', 'Perry', 'had', 'been', 'discovered', 'doing', 'plays', 'Herbert', 'Berghof', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'married', 'Uta', 'Hagen', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'film', 'work', 'twins', 'ever', 'did', 'just', 'seemed', 'drop', 'sight', 'afterward', 'heightening', 'reality', 'performances', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'theatre', '1972', 'bought', 'extant', 'premise', 'was', 'skillfully', 'handled', 'visually', 'Mulligan', 'was', 'strung', 'midway', 'when', 'Uta', 'Hagen', 'grandmother', 'Ada', 'Perry', 'revealed', 'young', 'Niles', 'bad', 'brother', 'Holland', 'had', 'been', 'dead', 'year.The', 'movie', 'worked', 'two', 'levels', 'successfully', 'was', 'sun-kissed', 'rural', '1930', 'heartland', 'kid', 'woodland', 'paradise', 'one', 'hand', 'great', 'spans', 'forest', 'field', 'old', 'barns', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'cellars', 'Juxtaposed', 'overlapping', 'intermeshing', 'discovered', 'Gothic', 'plot', 'complete', 'doomed', 'family', 'haunted', 'dark', 'psychic', 'powers', 'family', 'crest', 'was', 'peregrine', 'falcon', 'name', 'Perry', 'emblazoned', 'heirloom', 'ring', 'creaking', 'weathervane', 'high', 'Victorian', 'style', 'house', 'Murder', 'stalked', 'Perry', 'farm', 'spread', 'neighbors', 'murder', 'disguised', 'accident.Mulligan', 'orchestrated', 'wonderful', 'touching', 'moments', 'Uta', 'Hagen', 'young', 'Chris', 'Niles', 'loving', 'moments', 'whereby', 'blue-eyed', 'angelic', 'tow-headed', 'child', 'adored', 'wise', 'spirtually', 'advanced', 'grandmother', 'Much', 'was', 'made', 'special', 'psychic', 'games', 'played', 'Niles', 'projecting', 'mind', 'perhaps', 'even', 'essence', 'things', 'others', 'guessing', 'sex', 'sister', 'unborn', 'child', 'even', 'projecting', 'crow', 'able', 'cognizantly', 'fly', 'freely', 'farmlands', 'cawing', 'greetings', 'all', 'recognized', 'was', 'game', 'Niles', 'was', 'so', 'adept', 'had', 'perfected', 'so', 'well', 'had', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'own', 'split', 'personality', 'embracing', 'form', 'complete', 'denial', 'brother', 'actual', 'death', 'further', 'denial', 'own', 'responsiblity', 'conducting', 'divers', 'heinous', 'acts', 'guise', 'Holland', 'So', 'Niles', 'never', 'had', 'be', 'alone', 'would', 'not', 'accept', 'being', 'alone.Diana', 'Muldaur', 'mother', 'Alexandra', 'was', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'archetypical', 'Gothic', 'doomed', 'heroine', 'beautiful', 'vulnerable', 'descending', 'madness', 'darkness', 'catatonia', 'meager', 'attempts', 'regain', 'emotional', 'balance', 'recapture', 'light', 'were', 'soon', 'dashed', 'evil', 'actions', 'reactions', 'Niles', 'who', 'seemed', 'love', 'loathe', 'definitely', 'wished', 'harm.Uta', 'Hagen', 'great', 'actress', 'Theatre', 'completed', 'only', 'three', 'films', 'slew', 'television', 'roles', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'kind', 'Maria', 'Ouspenskaya', 'mid-European', 'matriarch', 'kind', 'dark', 'past', 'considerable', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'radiated', 'love', 'entire', 'doomed', 'family', 'riddled', 'guilt', 'part', 'machinations', 'plot', 'was', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'martyr', 'order', 'stop', 'killings', 'was', 'kinky', 'delicious', 'twist', 'sacrifice', 'was', 'avail.Victor', 'French', 'gave', 'fine', 'performance', 'small', 'role', 'farm', 'handyman', 'Mr.', 'Angelini', '[', 'nice', 'symbolism', ']', 'did', 'well', 'brief', 'scenes', 'illustrating', 'frustration', 'lonliness', 'emigrant', 'America', 'Depression', 'man', 'descended', 'drunkeness', 'panacea', 'refuge', 'only', 'find', 'dragged', 'enebriated', 'sweaty', 'slumber', 'accused', 'murdering', 'infant', 'Lindburgh', 'case', 'era', 'witnessed', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'insane', 'mob', 'rule', 'family', 'authorities', 'leaped', 'headlong', 'incorrect', 'conclusions', 'John', 'Ritter', 'was', 'adequate', 'likewise', 'small', 'role', 'Rider', 'son-in-law', 'living', 'Perry', 'household', 'was', 'tiny', 'part', 'hinted', 'Ritter', 'future', 'talents.The', 'ironic', 'ending', 'reasonated', 'significant', 'chords', 'horror', 'contata', 'fade', 'one', 'wondered', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'adolescent', 'death', 'list', 'Mulligan', 'struck', 'gold', 'mining', 'Tryon', 'dark', 'tale']",The Other VHS

His grandmother, Ada, who has taught them ""the Game"", a mind-projection technique, gradually learns the horrible truth about the tragedies,and decides to take matters into her own hands. Uta Hagen, who played the grandmother, does a bravura performance that really should have won an Oscar.The first half of the movie moves rather slowly; a lot of characterization and scene development occurs, seemingly unnecessarily, but actually vital to the plot. While the ""trick"" won't be given away here, keen observers of the interaction between all of the characters will be able to figure it out.This movie is in the same vein as 70s introspective, slow-moving movies that were the hallmark of the era.

The MTV generation has been ruined by Rambo films, where everything happens at a mile-a-minute; this film is not one of those.

They were 10 years old at the time of filming and the movie was released in New York on their 11th birthday, May 23, 1972.What really makes this an unforgettable film a pleasure to watch is the fine casting and dramatic talents of Uta Hagen, Diana Muldaur, Victor French, Lou Frizzell and Loretta Leversee.The acting from Chris and Martin Udvarnoky is impeccable and are absolutly perfect for their roles.The scenes with Portia Nelson as ""Mrs. Rowe"" are memorable.Uta Hagen was always a professional performer on stage and film that this role was really her breakthrough role for people of our generation.Also in the cast is John Ritter, Norma Connolly, Jenny Sullivan, Jack Collins, Clarence Crow and Ed Bakey.After this film, John Ritter went on to star as a pastor in ""The Waltons"" tv series and later reached fame in the character of ""Jack Tripper"" on ""Three's Company""/""Three's A Crowd"" tv series'.Clarence Crow who played ""Russell"" was a local boy born in Murphy's California.  The Other (1972) is his only film.The cinematography of this film is so beautiful and the location was perfect.  They filmed in Murphys, California to resemble Connecticut.

249269,A106016KSI0YQ,6301300548,Jay Dickson,"[3, 3]","Just as it was for so many other American film genres, the Seventies were a kind of renaissance period for horror movies, and saw some of the most genuinely creepy films ever made, some of them quite bloody, and others more elegantly scary. This 1972 Robert Mulligan film falls into the latter category, and makes superb work of a heady rural Connecticut summer atmosphere as a backdrop for the story. As the film begins we have trouble figuring out the relations of the extended Perry family living together on a large farm: there is the married daughter Torrie, Aunt Vee and her horrible tattletale child Russell, and fragile shut-in Alexandra (Diana Muldaur). And there is also Alexandra's mother, the Russian immigrant Ada (Uta Hagen, in a rare film appearance), and Alexandra's twin sons Niles and Holland (Martin and Chris Udvarnoky). Gradually we begin to realize something is not quite right with the mischief-making twins, and that the elder, Holland, is genuinely malicious, and given to playing mysterious deadly pranks. Part of the film's most genuinely disturbing qualities are that we never feel we quite get the full story on the ambiguous relationship between Holland and Niles--or what it fully has to do with the strange ""great game"" Ada has taught Niles to play. While some of the film's effects are a bit cheesy, many are genuinely horrific, and work very well on the imagination by not showing everything (the eventually revealed whereabouts of Torrie's missing baby being the most famous). Mulligan has a genuine gift for recreating a fly-buzzed, dreamy atmosphere of a Depression-era New England summer that seems to work with the film's horrors in remarkable ways. Much depends on the film's casting, and though Hagen is not as believable as you'd like, the Udvarnoky twins are wonderfully effective, seeming alternately sweet and repulsive as the plot demands; as with his TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD a decade earlier, Mulligan again shows his real feel for working with child actors. The beautiful Muldaur, more often seen as a television actress, also has one of her rare compelling roles for film as the twins' fragile and haunted mother.",4,My Brother/Myself,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,2160,"['Just', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'American', 'film', 'genres', 'Seventies', 'were', 'kind', 'renaissance', 'period', 'horror', 'movies', 'saw', 'most', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'quite', 'bloody', 'others', 'more', 'elegantly', 'scary', '1972', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'film', 'latter', 'category', 'superb', 'work', 'heady', 'rural', 'Connecticut', 'summer', 'atmosphere', 'backdrop', 'story', 'film', 'have', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'relations', 'extended', 'Perry', 'family', 'living', 'together', 'large', 'farm', 'married', 'daughter', 'Torrie', 'Aunt', 'Vee', 'horrible', 'tattletale', 'child', 'Russell', 'fragile', 'shut-in', 'Alexandra', 'Diana', 'Muldaur', 'also', 'Alexandra', 'mother', 'Russian', 'immigrant', 'Ada', 'Uta', 'Hagen', 'rare', 'film', 'appearance', 'Alexandra', 'twin', 'sons', 'Niles', 'Holland', 'Martin', 'Chris', 'Udvarnoky', 'Gradually', 'begin', 'realize', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'mischief-making', 'twins', 'elder', 'Holland', 'genuinely', 'malicious', 'given', 'playing', 'mysterious', 'deadly', 'pranks', 'Part', 'film', 'most', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'qualities', 'are', 'never', 'feel', 'quite', 'get', 'full', 'story', 'ambiguous', 'relationship', 'Holland', 'Niles', 'what', 'fully', 'do', 'strange', 'great', 'game', 'Ada', 'taught', 'Niles', 'play', 'film', 'effects', 'are', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'many', 'are', 'genuinely', 'horrific', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'imagination', 'not', 'showing', 'everything', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'whereabouts', 'Torrie', 'missing', 'baby', 'being', 'most', 'famous', 'Mulligan', 'genuine', 'gift', 'recreating', 'fly-buzzed', 'dreamy', 'atmosphere', 'Depression-era', 'New', 'England', 'summer', 'work', 'film', 'horrors', 'remarkable', 'ways', 'Much', 'film', 'casting', 'Hagen', 'not', 'as', 'believable', ""'d"", 'like', 'Udvarnoky', 'twins', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'effective', 'seeming', 'alternately', 'sweet', 'repulsive', 'plot', 'TO', 'KILL', 'A', 'MOCKINGBIRD', 'decade', 'earlier', 'Mulligan', 'again', 'real', 'feel', 'working', 'child', 'actors', 'beautiful', 'Muldaur', 'more', 'often', 'seen', 'television', 'actress', 'also', 'one', 'rare', 'compelling', 'roles', 'film', 'twins', 'fragile', 'haunted', 'mother']",The Other VHS

249272,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6301300548,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","Interesting suspense film along the lines of movies like ""The Bad Seed"", this effective little shocker that evolved from the early 1970s is surprisingly a good movie. I wasn't expecting much from it, and the cover of the DVD led me to believe it was something along the lines of ""The Omen"", but I was pleasantly surprised with how the film turned out. It's an effective little horror movie with plenty of twists and turns, a clever script, and some pretty good acting. Set in an unnamed American farming township in 1935, the story revolves around eleven-year-old Niles Perry and his identical twin brother Holland. Portrayed by can't-tell-'em-apart twins Chris and Martin Udvarnoky, Niles and Holland are part of an extended family whose matriarch is Ada (legendary German actress Uta Hagen). The boys' father is dead, and their mother (Diana Muldaur) spends most of her screen time traipsing dourly about the homestead.From the get-go, Niles is obviously the well-behaved one of the two, as well as the 'follower' in their relationship. Holland resorts to various mischief, often landing his twin into trouble in his stead. There's some sort of family heirloom in a clandestine tobacco tin which Holland has apparently relinquished to Niles, who doesn't seem to want it. A traveling circus comes to the area, featuring a sleight-of-hand magician who inspires the boys. Ada is a wisened old Russian immigrant, and she shares a special bond with Niles which seems to be clairvoyant in nature. When the twins' mother is paralyzed in a tragic fall after confronting them about the mysterious heirloom, Ada realizes that she must set right a great evil which she had unknowingly set off some time before. And although Holland appears to be at the center of the misdeeds afoot here, Niles must confront his own participation in the events which have shaped the present scenario.The murderous ""accidents"" telegraphed in ""The Other"" are few and bloodless. This is not a graphic film by any means. But it is certainly horrific, at least during the second act. Once again, you'll find yourself musing, ""Wait....this is rated PG ?!?"" I my respects to the late Victor French (known more affectionately to TV audiences as Mr. Edwards on ""Little House On The Prairie"") as a crazed farm-hand who figures in strongly during the blood-freezing finale. You may also recognize a young John Ritter who makes a couple small and modest appearances through out the film. The real-life twins are excellent in this film. It's really a shame that this was their only film.The term ""psychological thriller"" was coined a long time ago, probably by some filmmaker who wanted a more dignified label for the horror flick he was shooting at the time. ""The Other"" is all of the above. It plumbs the depths of psychological dysfunction and murderous illusion while convincingly illustrating the look and the lay of 1935 Americana, much like Mulligan's job on ""Mockingbird"" ten years prior. It snares, ingratiates, rivets, shocks and then horrifies you. And it got a PG. Only in 1972, I guess....",4,If you've seen it once: it will never leave you,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,3063,"['Interesting', 'suspense', 'film', 'lines', 'movies', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'effective', 'little', 'shocker', 'evolved', 'early', '1970s', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'cover', 'DVD', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'something', 'lines', 'Omen', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'effective', 'little', 'horror', 'movie', 'plenty', 'twists', 'turns', 'clever', 'script', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'Set', 'unnamed', 'American', 'farming', 'township', '1935', 'story', 'eleven-year-old', 'Niles', 'Perry', 'identical', 'twin', 'brother', 'Holland', 'Portrayed', ""can't-tell-'em-apart"", 'twins', 'Chris', 'Martin', 'Udvarnoky', 'Niles', 'Holland', 'are', 'part', 'extended', 'family', 'matriarch', 'Ada', 'legendary', 'German', 'actress', 'Uta', 'Hagen', 'boys', 'father', 'dead', 'mother', 'Diana', 'Muldaur', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'traipsing', 'dourly', 'homestead.From', 'get-go', 'Niles', 'obviously', 'well-behaved', 'one', 'two', 'as', 'well', ""'follower"", 'relationship', 'Holland', 'various', 'mischief', 'often', 'landing', 'twin', 'trouble', 'stead', 'sort', 'family', 'heirloom', 'clandestine', 'tobacco', 'tin', 'Holland', 'apparently', 'relinquished', 'Niles', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'traveling', 'circus', 'area', 'featuring', 'sleight-of-hand', 'magician', 'who', 'boys', 'Ada', 'wisened', 'old', 'Russian', 'immigrant', 'shares', 'special', 'bond', 'Niles', 'be', 'clairvoyant', 'nature', 'When', 'twins', 'mother', 'paralyzed', 'tragic', 'fall', 'confronting', 'mysterious', 'heirloom', 'Ada', 'must', 'set', 'right', 'great', 'evil', 'had', 'unknowingly', 'set', 'off', 'time', 'Holland', 'be', 'center', 'misdeeds', 'afoot', 'here', 'Niles', 'must', 'confront', 'own', 'participation', 'events', 'have', 'shaped', 'present', 'scenario.The', 'murderous', 'accidents', 'telegraphed', 'Other', 'are', 'few', 'bloodless', 'not', 'graphic', 'film', 'means', 'certainly', 'horrific', 'least', 'second', 'act', 'Once', 'again', ""'ll"", 'find', 'musing', 'Wait', '.this', 'rated', 'PG', 'respects', 'late', 'Victor', 'French', 'known', 'more', 'affectionately', 'TV', 'audiences', 'Mr.', 'Edwards', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'crazed', 'farm-hand', 'who', 'strongly', 'blood-freezing', 'finale', 'may', 'also', 'recognize', 'young', 'John', 'Ritter', 'who', 'couple', 'small', 'modest', 'appearances', 'film', 'real-life', 'twins', 'are', 'excellent', 'film', 'really', 'shame', 'was', 'only', 'film.The', 'term', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'was', 'coined', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'probably', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'wanted', 'more', 'dignified', 'label', 'horror', 'flick', 'was', 'shooting', 'time', 'Other', 'above', 'depths', 'psychological', 'dysfunction', 'murderous', 'illusion', 'convincingly', 'illustrating', 'look', 'lay', '1935', 'Americana', 'much', 'Mulligan', 'job', 'Mockingbird', 'ten', 'years', 'prior', 'ingratiates', 'rivets', 'shocks', 'then', 'horrifies', 'got', 'PG', 'Only', '1972', 'guess']",The Other VHS

I'll just say that this movie features identical twin brothers and mysterious accidents that occur on a farm.  Just some thoughts...The Other (1972) to me is a very strange psychological horror movie.  This is one of those movies that keeps you guessing and has a lot of twists and turns.  It takes place in rural Connecticut in 1935.  The movie is very slow moving, especially for the first 50 minutes or so.  When watching this movie I felt as though I was watching The Waltons with a little bit of Little House On The Prairie sprinkled in, but with a twist of horror.  Probably 95% of the movie takes place during daylight hours.  Most of the time it doesn't even feel like a horror movie, but the second half of the movie injects a horror element.The musical score is by Jerry Goldsmith.  The music is mostly upbeat throughout the movie and would fit right into an episode of The Waltons or Little House On The Prairie.  A very young John Ritter has a very small role in this movie.

It was frightful beyond anything else I had read at the time. When the movie came out I couldn't wait to see it. When I did finally see it I was both thrilled and disappointed.Translating a book with numerous rich characters and subplots to the screen is often a difficult task, as was in this case. But overall I think they did a great job.Watching this movie again, years later, I still feel the same because I can still remember how involved the book was. I am not hoping for a remake of the movie, that would probably prove a horrendous affair.But... judging the movie all on it's own I would have to say it is a very good movie.It is a period piece as well as being a thriller with drama set in. All the actors do a fantastic job. The sets and cinematography are great. This is a classic piece without a doubt. It has a slow build up as any good thriller should have.What is striking about this story is the slow development into unrecoverable terror that the story takes us on. When the momentum finally starts it's downhill roll all knuckles are white in anticipation of the final crash.But ultimatley it is a story of good and evil. In this case, both stuggling for the same body, ironically displayed in identical twins in this story.

Niles and Holland Perry, twins, are the two younger sons of the family, both somewhere around 10 or 11 years of age.Niles is the good one; Holland is his opposite. Also part of the family is Ada, the Russian grandmother of the two boys, who looks after them with great care and with a special gift as well--the ""game"", in which she teaches them to project themselves into the mind's eye of another being. We first see Niles playing the game with a crow; he sees what the crow sees when the bird is flying high over the surrounding town.As it happens, playing the ""game"" is strongly tied to the tragic events that ensue during the course of the film in which several people die. But how this happens is ultimately a huge surprise (which won't be revealed here). On hand here is Diana Muldaur as the suffering mother, Uta Hagen in what should have been an Academy Award-winning role as Ada, and John Ritter in an early role as the Perry older son who has married and is awaiting the birth of his first child.The look and feel of the times are recreated quite well; director Robert Mulligan has done an excellent job in his delivery of a script by Tom Tryon, the author of the novel on which the film was based. There's a kind of no-frills style on display here which serves the film well; we see the characters, often up close, involved in each other's lives in a way that rings true for that era.  Personal relationships are the key to the tragedy and the terror that is this film.A real chestnut worth seeing if not owning, The Other is a great example of non-stylized film that holds up extremely well after more than 30 years.

249289,A26WVK274IA7DN,6301300548,Sarah Bellum,"[4, 5]","Niles and Holland Perry are seemingly about as different as night and day, but they are also inseparable. They play together all the time, get into mischief together and share secrets. It appears the two have some pretty dark secrets. Based on a novel by Tom Tryon, this film takes its time setting the mood and introducing its horrific themes. In ways it plays like a nostalgic trip down childhood memory lane, with buying fresh vegetables from a traveling farm market, stealing cookies from the oven and spending lazy afternoons fishing in the local pond. Director Robert Mulligan brings much of the natural, rural feel to ""The Other"" that he brought to some of his other movies, such as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""The Man In the Moon."" With it, he lulls into a sense of comfort and complacency that belies the evil that lurks nearby. This really is a masterfully crafted movie and, although I have not read the novel, I can say the story unfolds much the way a book does. My only gripe would be the performance of the boy who plays Niles, Chris Udvarnoky. I realize he is supposed to be a nice, polite kid, but he is so over the top I could barely stand to watch. Not only is he saccharine sweet, but he occasionally gets his intonation all wrong, as though reading from a book. He was only about ten when he made the movie, so I must cut him some slack. I just thought Mr. Mulligan might coax a really good performance from his child actors the way he did in the two aforementioned films.

Okay so maybe I exagerated on the verys, but this is a very scary movie. One of the previous reviewers said that it was scarier than The Exorcist and The Omen, well I have to disagree. That put my expectations high for this film, but I still wasn't dissappointed. I think Satan is probably the scariest thing in this universe. Actually the only thing scarier than the devil is the wrath of God and you CAN'T capture that on film. This is a rather unusual horror film that is kind of confusing, but entertaining and very disturbing. Even if by some weird circumstance you don't get scared, you still have to admit that it is a really good movie. It is very well made so even if the scares wear off on you, there is still a great story with GREAT characters and most of all THE BEST ACTING I'VE EVER SEEN! The boys are amazing.They portray their characters so well. This new generation will not appreciate this film. As a matter of fact, THEY'LL HATE IT!!! That's because todays youth like movies like The New Guy and Scary Movie, and stupid NOT SCARY MOVIES like Scream, I know what you Did Last Summer, Cherry Falls, and Prom Night. They don't like a complicated story, so if you are looking for something with buckets of blood, DON'T LOOK HERE! I don't mind gore, as long as it helps the movie (The Omen comes to mind) and gore really in most movies doesn't make the movie scary, it actually takes away from the atmosphere. Some slashers are very scary like Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho, Nightmare on Elm Street, The Fog, The Boogeyman, and Friday the 13th part 1. But this generation can't appreciate this type of horror, but they will eventually. Believe it or not, I'm part of the youth of today, and I'm very hard to scare, so if it scared me, it'll terrify you. While it is not a scary as The Exorcist or The Omen, it has a much better story than both of those. Yes this movie is very scary, and joins the likes of The Exorcist, The Omen, Rosemary's Baby, and The Evil Dead as one of the scariest movies ever!!! Remember that this a bit of a thinker, so if you don't like thinker this is definately not for you. I hope I have helped you with your choice of buying this movie.

The leads are played by the legendary Uta Hagen in a rare film appearance and the talented young Udvarnoky twins as Niles and Holland, with a supporting cast to match them. Add some stunning cinematography, ace editing, and an eerie score by the late Jerry Goldsmith (who also scored THE OMEN), and the result is one of the finest films of its kind.Nearly every reviewer here has given this 5 stars, and we've all mentioned that the deliberate pace and lack of outright gore only add to the film's effectiveness. True. But I think the most effective thing about this remarkable story is the fact that it is entirely possible--it is not far-fetched or supernatural. Tryon based his novel on actual case studies. If that doesn't scare you, what does?In a genre where vampires and zombies are all-too-prevalent, it is a chilling pleasure to experience a film that explores real, earthly evil.

The boys live with and are being raised by their large extended family (including a very young John Ritter) after the death of their father.  Their mother (Diana Muldaur of ""LA Law"") is unstable and has become a near recluse in her attic bedroom.  The boys are thus free to run wild and wreak havoc on their family and neighbors.Released in 1972, ""The Other"" is rather eerie with supernatural overtones, including a magic ring and a strange ""game"" the boys like to play with the help of their grandmother (the talented stage actress Uta Hagen).  The tone is helped immensely by the controlled direction of Robert Mulligan (""To Kill a Mockingbird"") as well as uniformly good acting; the twins are played skillfully by Chris and Martin Udvarnoky - this movie was their only one.On the negative side, the story builds very slowly, and some viewers may be put off by the languid first half.  However, the movie definitely pays off: the last 20 minutes are tense and chilling.  There are a number of twists -- mostly obvious but very effective nevertheless.

The story is set in rural Connecticut in the 1940s, and revolves around the Perry clan...the central characters are the young Perry twins, 11-year old Hammond and Niles Perry who frolic in the sun and enjoy games as boys do, but there is more to it than that, of course. Amidst this idyllic setting, a series of family tragedies takes place...the Perry's father has died of an accident, the mother is rendered an invalid due to some sort of mental breakdown, and there are more tragedies to follow. The only adult that seems to have an inkling of what's going on is Uta Hagen's grandmother character, who teaches Niles 'the game' which reveals darker undertones as the story moves along...we see a golden-haired boy who seems harmless enough on the surface but as time progresses, something darker is revealed, leaving us reeling when the truth is revealed [though it doesn't take too long for the viewer to deduce what is actually unfolding here]. Is it a case of evil vs good twin, split personality or unnatural forces at work? Not to give too much away, let's just say that this movie is a first-rate psychological horror movie that has moments that will give you the creeps. The actor who plays Niles Perry does an excellent job of portraying a tormented soul, and Uta Hagen is wonderful as the all-seeing grandmother that is torn between her love for her grandson and the need to put a stop to the horrors unfolding around her. This is a must-see for fans of atmospheric horror with a psychological twist.",5,Creepy psychological horror,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,1662,"['Other', 'classic', 'horror', 'story', 'pure', 'psychological', 'terror', 'slowly', 'paced', 'necessary', 'character', 'plot', 'development', 'story', 'set', 'rural', 'Connecticut', '1940s', 'around', 'Perry', 'clan', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'young', 'Perry', 'twins', '11-year', 'old', 'Hammond', 'Niles', 'Perry', 'who', 'frolic', 'sun', 'enjoy', 'games', 'boys', 'do', 'more', 'course', 'Amidst', 'idyllic', 'setting', 'series', 'family', 'tragedies', 'place', 'Perry', 'father', 'died', 'accident', 'mother', 'rendered', 'invalid', 'due', 'sort', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'are', 'more', 'tragedies', 'follow', 'only', 'adult', 'have', 'inkling', 'what', 'going', 'Uta', 'Hagen', 'grandmother', 'character', 'who', 'Niles', 'game', 'darker', 'undertones', 'story', 'moves', 'see', 'golden-haired', 'boy', 'who', 'harmless', 'enough', 'surface', 'time', 'progresses', 'something', 'darker', 'revealed', 'leaving', 'reeling', 'when', 'truth', 'revealed', '[', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'viewer', 'deduce', 'what', 'actually', 'unfolding', 'here', ']', 'case', 'evil', 'vs', 'good', 'twin', 'split', 'personality', 'unnatural', 'forces', 'work', 'Not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'first-rate', 'psychological', 'horror', 'movie', 'moments', 'will', 'give', 'creeps', 'actor', 'who', 'Niles', 'Perry', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'tormented', 'soul', 'Uta', 'Hagen', 'wonderful', 'all-seeing', 'grandmother', 'torn', 'love', 'grandson', 'need', 'put', 'stop', 'horrors', 'unfolding', 'must-see', 'fans', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'psychological', 'twist']",The Other VHS
