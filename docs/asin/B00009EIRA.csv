I can speak for deaf and hard of hearing people, it is extremely frustrating for me when a studio doesn't produce it with CC or English subtitle. I know the movie is good but no CC.",2,Disappointed!,1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,314,"['reason', 'why', 'am', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'closed', 'captioning', 'barely', 'understand', 'CC', 'English', 'subtitle', 'can', 'speak', 'deaf', 'hard', 'hearing', 'people', 'extremely', 'frustrating', 'when', 'studio', ""n't"", 'produce', 'CC', 'English', 'subtitle', 'know', 'movie', 'good', 'CC']",Dodson's Journey

You get a real feel for the sadness this family goes through as it is on the brink of divorce, but with the sadness is also hope for a new beginning!Great movie for all ages!!",5,Very Good,1085875200,"05 30, 2004",2004,243,"['Acting', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'David', 'Elliot', 'brilliant', 'one', 'get', 'real', 'feel', 'sadness', 'family', 'brink', 'divorce', 'sadness', 'also', 'hope', 'new', 'beginning', 'Great', 'movie', 'ages']",Dodson's Journey

Hernandez Jr. ""jdhtampa""","[13, 14]","I am a 35 year old male, and although I don't have any of my own kids, I can say this film did a great job of making a soulful journey for a man that is wanting to keep his family in tact, while the wife is feeling that the relationship has ended.  There are two kids involved, but the poetic nature of the film treats these matters with great delicacy and love in the midst of adversity. The pleasantness of this film is the simplicity of what is real an important. The relationship between him and his daughter is precious. One previous film done by this director: Simple Life of Noah Dearborn.  I have not seen that one, but I am looking forward to it now after seeing this film.",5,A heartwarming flick on a sensitive issue,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,682,"['am', '35', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'own', 'kids', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'soulful', 'journey', 'man', 'wanting', 'keep', 'family', 'tact', 'wife', 'feeling', 'relationship', 'ended', 'are', 'two', 'kids', 'involved', 'poetic', 'nature', 'film', 'matters', 'great', 'delicacy', 'love', 'midst', 'adversity', 'pleasantness', 'film', 'simplicity', 'what', 'real', 'important', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'precious', 'One', 'previous', 'film', 'done', 'director', 'Simple', 'Life', 'Noah', 'Dearborn', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'one', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'now', 'seeing', 'film']",Dodson's Journey

This is a wonderful, quiet film, with unexpected depths. Since then, I've watched it many-many times, read Dodson's novel and almost all the other books he mentions. A good film lead me to a deeper knowledge of American literature and culture.

I always like David James Elliott specifically for a role like this knowing how he is in his real life as a father.  I would think many children would envy to have a father like it.,5,Great story that makes you think,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,322,"['loved', 'story', 'emotional', 'journey', 'daughter', 'warmed', 'heart', 'see', 'evolving', 'great', 'father', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'always', 'David', 'James', 'Elliott', 'specifically', 'role', 'knowing', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'father', 'would', 'think', 'many', 'children', 'would', 'envy', 'have', 'father']",Dodson's Journey
