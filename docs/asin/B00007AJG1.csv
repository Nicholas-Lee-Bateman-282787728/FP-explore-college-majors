While in New Jack, Wesley Snipes character ""Nino"" is a cold,bloodthirsty,womanizing, and heartless druglord. Snipes' role as Carmello in SH is much more conservative in terms of his mannerisims, attire, and he is compassionate, humane, and sympathetic, but still not forgetting that he is first and foremost a drug kingpin who needs to take care of business. Ironically, Carmello must care for his ailing father, whose life is in shambles as a result of abusing the same product that made his own son rich, and eventually succumbs. I would even go on a limb to say Nino from NJC could be regarded as being re-incarnated in another life in this film as another character(Carmello). Carmello eventually tires of his life as a dealer, and realizes that there is more to life than the jet set lifestyle, wealth and material things.Eventually,Carmello is given another chance at redemption, but must live the rest of his life with a crippling injury that was inflicted by his own brother, who eventually dies as well. Carmello starts over far from the concrete jungles of NYC with a new wife and child.  The remarkable Clarence Williams, Ernie Hudson, Vondie Curtis-Hall, the lovely Theresa Randle, Abe Vigoda and other actors add to the depth of this film. Even after 10 years, this movie still hits home.",5,"Great, gripping story",1098835200,"10 27, 2004",2004,1512,"['watching', 'New', 'Jack', 'City', 'Sugar', 'Hill', 'definitely', 'similar', 'milder', 'pared', 'down', 'version', 'former', 'still', 'stark', 'realities', 'street', 'life', 'drug', 'trade', 'being', 'common', 'denominator', 'New', 'Jack', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'character', 'Nino', 'cold', 'bloodthirsty', 'womanizing', 'heartless', 'druglord', 'Snipes', 'role', 'Carmello', 'SH', 'much', 'more', 'conservative', 'terms', 'mannerisims', 'attire', 'compassionate', 'humane', 'sympathetic', 'still', 'not', 'forgetting', 'first', 'foremost', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'who', 'take', 'care', 'business', 'Ironically', 'Carmello', 'must', 'care', 'ailing', 'father', 'life', 'shambles', 'result', 'abusing', 'same', 'product', 'made', 'own', 'son', 'rich', 'eventually', 'succumbs', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'limb', 'say', 'Nino', 'NJC', 'could', 'be', 'regarded', 'being', 're-incarnated', 'life', 'film', 'character', 'Carmello', 'Carmello', 'eventually', 'life', 'dealer', 'more', 'life', 'jet', 'set', 'lifestyle', 'wealth', 'material', 'things.Eventually', 'Carmello', 'given', 'chance', 'redemption', 'must', 'live', 'rest', 'life', 'crippling', 'injury', 'was', 'inflicted', 'own', 'brother', 'who', 'eventually', 'as', 'well', 'Carmello', 'far', 'concrete', 'jungles', 'NYC', 'new', 'wife', 'child', 'remarkable', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Vondie', 'Curtis-Hall', 'lovely', 'Theresa', 'Randle', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'other', 'actors', 'add', 'depth', 'film', 'Even', '10', 'years', 'movie', 'still', 'home']",N/A

726183,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00007AJG1,J from NY,"[0, 0]","Though I can rarely take Wesley Snipes seriously (in anything) this film has always stuck out to me as being one of the most effective examples of modern film noir that I have ever seen--also, one of the most dead on commentaries about drug use and the poverty of the inner cities.  The mood that runs through it is, by turns, hopeful and funereal.  At no point did I honestly think that Roemello Skuggs (Welsey Snipes' character) was going to escape Harlem, or that his older brother Ray (Michael Wright) were going to make it out of their harsh upbringing.The story is complex and the anger pretty intense, but it's clear from the outset that all involved are doomed in some way.  Even Abe Vigoda, of Godfather fame, who plays Gus, an Italian mobster who was close to Roemello from childhood, seems a bit worn and, well, old.  This is the moral of the film:  drugs make everyone who participate in them prematurely old, wasted, and greedy.When Roemello was a child, his father (a heroin addict played with masterfully painful believability by Clarence Williams) was a dealer for Gus, and became hooked on his own product.  Gus employed Roemello instead, who became his own employer, for a time leaving his old neighborhood.  He returns to aid his older brother, a hopeless dope fiend.The plot, though, is not what is as important here as the *mood*, which is absolutely masterful.  The atmosphere is pure noir, and though it is clearly set in the present, it has the magical sheen of a 1940's film.  Recommended viewing for all lovers of film, despite the occasional preachiness and hamminess.",4,"""I don't see no grocers here, Gus.""",1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,1595,"['can', 'rarely', 'take', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'seriously', 'anything', 'film', 'always', 'stuck', 'out', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'examples', 'modern', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'dead', 'commentaries', 'drug', 'use', 'poverty', 'inner', 'cities', 'mood', 'turns', 'hopeful', 'funereal', 'point', 'did', 'honestly', 'think', 'Roemello', 'Skuggs', 'Welsey', 'Snipes', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'escape', 'Harlem', 'older', 'brother', 'Ray', 'Michael', 'Wright', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'harsh', 'upbringing.The', 'story', 'complex', 'anger', 'pretty', 'intense', 'clear', 'outset', 'involved', 'are', 'doomed', 'way', 'Even', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'Godfather', 'fame', 'who', 'Gus', 'Italian', 'mobster', 'who', 'was', 'close', 'Roemello', 'childhood', 'bit', 'worn', 'well', 'old', 'moral', 'film', 'drugs', 'make', 'everyone', 'who', 'participate', 'prematurely', 'old', 'wasted', 'greedy.When', 'Roemello', 'was', 'child', 'father', 'heroin', 'addict', 'played', 'masterfully', 'painful', 'believability', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'was', 'dealer', 'Gus', 'became', 'hooked', 'own', 'product', 'Gus', 'employed', 'Roemello', 'instead', 'who', 'became', 'own', 'employer', 'time', 'leaving', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'aid', 'older', 'brother', 'hopeless', 'dope', 'fiend.The', 'plot', 'not', 'what', 'as', 'important', 'here', '*mood*', 'absolutely', 'masterful', 'atmosphere', 'pure', 'noir', 'clearly', 'set', 'present', 'magical', 'sheen', '1940', 'film', 'Recommended', 'viewing', 'lovers', 'film', 'occasional', 'preachiness', 'hamminess']",N/A

The script takes a lot from the Godfather trilogy. Some of the performances (including Wesley Snipes') were quite good, and the cinematography was excellent. I was particularly struck by a shot of Snipes standing on the roof of a building in the Sugar Hill neighborhood that he and his older brother control. There were some lovely shots of Mount Morris Park in the Autumn and of other attractive parts of Harlem, to the point that I found myself wondering if the cinematographer knew he was supposed to be filming a gritty crime drama. There were still plenty of ugly parts of Harlem in 1993-1994 when this movie was made, but they don't often show up on the screen here. A realtor could use clips from Sugar Hill as a promotional video for ""beautiful Harlem.""Some scenes are overacted, including the opening scene with the mother's death. Some cliches are visible (e.g. the young boy who wants to be a tough gangster like Snipes, and whom Snipes chases away, and who inevitably gets shot to death by Snipe's enemies before the end). The biggest problem with the film is that it tries to fit too much material. The history of drugs in Harlem, the tension between the brothers, the fall of their father, the dating life of Theresa Randle, the metaphorical (and at one point literal) chess game between Snipe's gang, and the Italians, and Ernie Hudson's newly arrived gang from Red Hook.

It reminds me of a time when Black cinema broke the mold with the stories that were told and how those stories were told. Sugar Hill is a well written and well acted tale film noir drama that never got the respect it truly deserves.Roemello(Wesley Snipes) wants to break free from a world of crime but is constantly dragged back in. He cant live a normal life or have a girlfriend in it because something bad is always happening around him. His brother Raynathan(Michael Wright) is very high-strung and causes some of Roemello's problems plus he has to deal with his drug-addicted father A.R.(Clarence Williams III).Wesley Snipes best performance is Roemello Skuggs. This movie proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that Wesley can act as well as play a serious role. Michael Wright is good as Raynathan even though he can get buckwild at times. Clarence Williams III is excellent as their drug-afflicted father A.R. He was always a great actor that never got enough credit for great roles such as this one, Hoodlum and Deep Cover. Theresa Randle is is pretty good as Roemello's girlfriend Melissa. She is innocent in the sense that she is not numb to death and violence and actually feels pain upon seeing something like for instance a dead body. Melissa is gorgeous as well as likable. There are also some strong performances by Abe Vigoda and Ernie Hudson.I love the setting of the movie as well as the cinematography. Director Leon Ichaso has an eye for things and you can see that as you watch this movie. Its a shame that the movie didnt do well and the director never did another movie again.
