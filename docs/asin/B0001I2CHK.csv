The things the characters say are continually surprising, metaphoric and profound: it's a bit like Shakespeare in a swamp. Love will make them all do crazy things, but true love transcends the squalor, opens their eyes and washes away their misdeeds.

806139,A1LDMDMUBJSUN4,B0001I2CHK,Bruce E. Munck,"[26, 28]","I sat through the entire movie, and while I did enjoy it I couldn't shake the aversion to all of the dirt. Everybody lived in absolute squalor except for the so-called ""rich"" folks. I have been around my share of country people and for the most part they have been clean and orderly folks. Contrast that to the characters in this flick who live in the most sickening of environments with dirt everywhere, dishes that appear to have never been washed, bugs crawling all over the kitchen...yechhhhh!!! Even the people themselves stayed covered in dirt for the whole movie. Real people don't live that way. The plot is good, the acting okay, and the ending pretty well fits with the storyline, so I can't give it fewer than three stars. Give the cast a bath and put them in more normal surroundings and it would be worth four stars. However, an argument could be made that the story needed this type of set to play out properly...I'm just saying it was pretty depressing. The story is set in a swampy area of Virginia and has a fair amount of action and tension. One of the lead characters has two or three marijuana plants growing on his porch and figures he'll be able to sell the pot when it's ready for harvest and make enough to give his wife a better life. Remember, I didn't give it five stars. Turns out the pot is junk and not able to get anyone 'high' so he goes about trying to come up with a way to get some good seeds to plant on his four acres of land. Meanwhile his wife is already working on her own plans for a better life and he suspects it. Throw in a local 'witch' who smokes profusely and reads bones in order to give his wife advice and you have the makings of this movie. Did I mention that this guy is also abusive? After giving our heroine a black eye he explains to her that that's just how he is and she needs to remember who she married. A real sweetheart of a guy! Of course there's also the demented friend of the husband who gets corralled into watching the wife and making sure she stays chained up while the husband is away. Well, you had to figure somebody would die and sho' nuff it happens. The local police woman appeared overly aloof and didn't seem to connect a body in a ditch with murder. She was ready to accept that it was either suicide or accidental death without so much as doing an investigation. She would never be a candidate for a part in CSI. This movie is worth watching if you can stomach the filth and don't mind the lack of startling twists. You the viewer are privileged to see everything that happens, which means, among other things, that you are never shocked by something unexpected. Not a lot of gore in this one, and only the slightest fleeting glimpse of nudity. Just as well since a naked woman covered in dirt would be less than arousing. Buy it...don't buy it...the choice is yours. I only rated it three stars because it would not be my first choice for a movie to watch.

806146,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B0001I2CHK,Margaux Paschke,"[12, 13]","I liked the way this movie worked.  We are introduced to a poor couple living in some nameless small town in the Deep South and watch this quirky little cast of characters live in squalor by choice as well as circumstance.  I liked that the movie portrayed the young pretty thing (Inez/Dominique Swain) realistically, she could not look too attractive in this film.  It starts out as a star-crossed lover movie but it's more of a fable - don't judge a book by its cover comes to mind along with several other proverbs.Plot goes something like this: fortune teller friend (Karen Allen) advises Inez that her true love is waiting for her.  Inez assumes it's the rich pasty faced aristocrat with whom she has been fornicating.  Her husband, struggling to get them out of poverty through robbery and other schemes, is not happy about the long disappearances of his wife on a daily basis so he beats & locks her up to stop her cheating ways.  Flowers is a creepy figure that sniffs around Inez and helps the husband keep guard.  Inez talks Flowers into doing her dirty work but things do not turn out the way she planned.  The ending was very fitting and had an edgy fairytale quality to it.  Rain comes poring down on Inez and her one true love, washing all their dirt away.  Which made ""Plain Dirty"" a very apropos title - living life sometimes is just plain dirty unless you have a fairy godmother (Karen Allen) and fate bring you your one true love, by any means necessary.There were key scenes that helped the characters come to life: when the husband places a chain around Inez' foot in an honest attempt to keep their marriage together, it is pathetic yet poignant; the touching scene where the fortune teller takes care of Inez and shares what little she has; or where Flowers and Inez discover they had the same childhood hiding spot.  These are not just ""backwoods hicks"" as one angry reviewer suggests and you don't need to go to poor areas to find people neglecting one another and ignoring what is right in front of them.  Also, I did not find Inez to be a helpless victim.  It is clear from the very beginning that it is not one of those movies.I gave it four stars for the engrossing characters and plotline and subtracted one star for the loopy MacBeth references - they have no place here andScotland, PAdoes a greater job of updating Shakespeare's MacBeth then this movie.",4,kept me glued to the screen,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,2385,"['liked', 'way', 'movie', 'worked', 'are', 'introduced', 'poor', 'couple', 'living', 'nameless', 'small', 'town', 'Deep', 'South', 'watch', 'quirky', 'little', 'cast', 'characters', 'live', 'squalor', 'choice', 'as', 'well', 'circumstance', 'liked', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'young', 'pretty', 'thing', 'Inez/Dominique', 'Swain', 'realistically', 'could', 'not', 'look', 'too', 'attractive', 'film', 'out', 'star-crossed', 'lover', 'movie', 'more', 'fable', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'mind', 'several', 'other', 'proverbs.Plot', 'something', 'fortune', 'teller', 'friend', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'Inez', 'true', 'love', 'waiting', 'Inez', 'rich', 'pasty', 'faced', 'aristocrat', 'whom', 'been', 'fornicating', 'husband', 'struggling', 'get', 'poverty', 'robbery', 'other', 'schemes', 'not', 'happy', 'long', 'disappearances', 'wife', 'daily', 'basis', 'so', 'up', 'stop', 'cheating', 'ways', 'Flowers', 'creepy', 'figure', 'Inez', 'husband', 'keep', 'guard', 'Inez', 'Flowers', 'doing', 'dirty', 'work', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'planned', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'fitting', 'had', 'edgy', 'fairytale', 'quality', 'Rain', 'poring', 'down', 'Inez', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'washing', 'dirt', 'away', 'Which', 'made', 'Plain', 'Dirty', 'very', 'apropos', 'title', 'living', 'life', 'sometimes', 'just', 'plain', 'dirty', 'have', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'fate', 'bring', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'means', 'necessary.There', 'were', 'key', 'scenes', 'helped', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'when', 'husband', 'chain', 'Inez', 'foot', 'honest', 'attempt', 'keep', 'marriage', 'together', 'pathetic', 'yet', 'poignant', 'touching', 'scene', 'where', 'fortune', 'teller', 'care', 'Inez', 'shares', 'what', 'little', 'where', 'Flowers', 'Inez', 'discover', 'had', 'same', 'childhood', 'hiding', 'spot', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'backwoods', 'hicks', 'one', 'angry', 'reviewer', 'suggests', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'poor', 'areas', 'find', 'people', 'neglecting', 'one', 'ignoring', 'what', 'right', 'front', 'Also', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'Inez', 'be', 'helpless', 'victim', 'clear', 'very', 'beginning', 'not', 'one', 'movies.I', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'engrossing', 'characters', 'plotline', 'subtracted', 'one', 'star', 'loopy', 'MacBeth', 'have', 'place', 'here', 'andScotland', 'greater', 'job', 'updating', 'Shakespeare', 'MacBeth', 'then', 'movie']",Plain Dirty

The story gets more ridiculous as the girl start to form a relation ship with a man she is physically repulsed by, instead of the guy she originally had the hots for. Finally, it was boring! It's a half hour movie at best dragged out into a full length movie. SO, all you `billy bobs' out there, feel free to grab a copy of this garbage and take your shots of JD and enjoy. To everyone else, if your looking for a half way decent domestic violence movie, I would stay with movies like `Enough' and `Sleeping with the enemy' or just go rent some old Fara Foset movies. She always liked getting the crap kicked out of her.

What starts off as a ""burning bed"" flick set in the Louisiana swamps ends up as a compelling drama in which three main characters undergo a life-changing transformation.  Swain fans may be disappointed that she spends the entire film covered in grime & most of it wearing an eye patch.  Once the abusive husband issue is resolved halfway through, the movie really comes into its own.  The ending is very satisfying as the two main characters realize that they are irresistibly connected in a most profound way.
