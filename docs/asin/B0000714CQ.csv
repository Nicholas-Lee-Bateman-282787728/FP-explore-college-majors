It was a typical Hey, Arnold! affair:-Arnold uses his usual level-headed point of view-Helga teases Arnold about how ""pathetic"" he is (but we all know how that *really* goes)!-Gerald assists Arnold in almost whatever he does, but doesn't stand by as an empty toolBut the movie has a premise: Arnold and his friends have to protect the city from losing a big part of itself because ATi, a new and big corporation wants to come in and tear it down; the flower shop, the meat shop, etc, etc.It has all that you have come to expect, with a small twist at the end. One of my favorite characters (besides Arnold, of course) was the quirky mortician towards the end, he was creepy but in a very nice way.Do Arnold and friends save the day?

It told a good story while staying true to the spirit of the show, which was always one of my favorites.  Sure, this could have just as easily been a Hey Arnold! special like the one about his parents' journal, but this big-screen feature wasn't bad as is.  Arnold is faced with having to save his neighborhood from a CEO named Scheck, voiced by Paul Sorvino, who wants to tear it down and build a shopping center.  I do wonder if something like that could happen in real life.  I mean, imminent domain is one thing, but this seems way over that.  Oh well, it still makes for a plot that Hey Arnold! has done so well over the years.  I did find the girl dispensing the spy gadgets pretty funny...apart from the regular cast, she was my favorite with that bus driver being a close second.  Overall, everything and everyone came together in the end and the solid story had a solid conclusion.

However, after I found Arnold and Helga listed on a YouTube video as Number 3 on a countdown of cartoon couples (""We all knew this one would pop up on here sooner or later""), I decided to take another look at the show (being a hopeless romantic), and I was pleasantly surprised. I had heard negative feedback on the movie, so I initially stayed away from it. But since the same person had given a negative review on ""Recess: School's Out"" which I enjoyed, I gave the movie a try, and I was underwhelmed.The movie starts out very slow, most of the characters disappear after the first half-hour, and while the storyline isn't bad, it's just not that interesting. I don't really want to explain it.However, there is one scene that I think is stellar, and that is the scene when Arnold and Helga are on the rooftop and Helga confesses to Arnold that she's been stalking him and that she's loved him ever since they met. Of course, at the end of the film, she claims that she didn't really mean all that, but it's still a nice touch for people who are fans of the relationship.So for first-timers, watch the show before you think about watching the movie.

The ones shows that I watch are: Wild ThornBerries, Spongebob & Hey Arnold!. These are the few that I actually like. Out of all 3,  Hey Arnold! is probably my favorite.When I heard about the movie a few months back I very stoked about it, but also afraid that I would be dissapointed since the vast majority of cartoons that become movies, usually are not very good.So I steeled myself and went to see the movie and I was only slightly dissapointed.The basic plot of the movie is this:  A big time corporation is trying to bulldoze Arnold's entire neighborhood to build a giant shopping mall.  Arnold not standing for this does whatever he can ( along with his friend Gerald.)  to keep Sheck the leader of the corp from bulldozing their neighborhood.The movie starts out kind of slow, but once it gets past the first half hour, the movie begins to really pick up & doesn't slow down until the movie is over.There is plenty of humor in it and some of the funniest parts are when it's ripping on other movies as well as other things.  Some of the younger audiences might not get some of them but since I'm 21 years old I was able to understand most of them.My personal favorite part had to be when they rip on the Incredible Hulk.  I laughed harder at that part more than any other point in the movie.the only real problem with this movie is that people that haven't ever watched the TV show probably wont know who most of the characters are.But if you are a fan of the show like me then I can guarentee that you will enjoy this movie",4,A great movie if you like the the show.,1025654400,"07 3, 2002",2002,1666,"['am', '21', 'years', 'old', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'very', 'much', 'TV', 'let', 'alone', 'Nickelodean', 'are', 'few', 'shows', 'Nick', 'do', 'regularly', 'watch', 'ones', 'watch', 'are', 'Wild', 'ThornBerries', 'Spongebob', 'Hey', 'Arnold', 'are', 'few', 'actually', '3', 'Hey', 'Arnold', 'probably', 'favorite.When', 'heard', 'movie', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'very', 'stoked', 'also', 'afraid', 'would', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'vast', 'majority', 'cartoons', 'become', 'movies', 'usually', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'good.So', 'steeled', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'slightly', 'dissapointed.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'movie', 'big', 'time', 'corporation', 'trying', 'bulldoze', 'Arnold', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'build', 'giant', 'shopping', 'mall', 'Arnold', 'not', 'standing', 'can', 'friend', 'Gerald', 'keep', 'Sheck', 'leader', 'corp', 'bulldozing', 'neighborhood.The', 'movie', 'out', 'kind', 'slow', 'once', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'really', 'pick', 'up', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'movie', 'over.There', 'plenty', 'humor', 'funniest', 'parts', 'are', 'when', 'ripping', 'other', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'things', 'younger', 'audiences', 'might', 'not', 'get', ""'m"", '21', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'able', 'understand', 'most', 'them.My', 'personal', 'favorite', 'part', 'had', 'be', 'when', 'rip', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'laughed', 'harder', 'part', 'more', 'other', 'point', 'movie.the', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'watched', 'TV', 'show', 'probably', 'wont', 'know', 'who', 'most', 'characters', 'are.But', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'then', 'can', 'guarentee', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Hey Arnold - The Movie

VICTORY IS MINE!&quot; :)Anyway on to the movie- This basically was the same thing as the &quot;Save Mighty Pete&quot; episode- big corporation wants to tear down the neighborhood, and of course Helga's dad, that arrogant jerk &quot;Big Bob Pataki&quot; joins in... and then Arnold &amp; etc do everything they can to stop it... Yea, u can kinda tell what was gonna happen easily...Also, Euguene wasn't in the movie enough(He's my all time favorite character,, but well his little &quot;singing&quot; part WAS hillarious :), and Curly wasn't in it, my other favorite character, or Chocolate Boy, haha :)All in all not a bad movie,, but I'll definitley take the show over it anydayGive Hey Arnold a shot if you've never watched it- It's a very funny and realistic show, and well it's really not part of all the &quot;new nicktoons&quot;- it's been on since like 1997",3,Could've been better... but oh well....,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,1887,"['Yes', 'will', 'admit', 'am', '20', 'Hey', 'Arnold', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'practically', 'only', 'good', 'cartoon', 'Nickelodeon', 'still', 'has-', 'could', 'take', 'away', 'Ren', 'amp', 'Stimpy', 'Rocko', 'Modern', 'Life', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'na', 'take', 'away', 'THIS', 'one', 'Believe', 'not', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'show-', 'other', 'crap', 'Nick', 'days', 'show', 'actually', 'DOES', 'have', 'meaning', 'it-', ""n't"", 'talking', 'sponge', 'cat', 'amp', 'dog', 'stuck', 'together', 'show', 'real-life', '4th', 'graders', 'type', 'problems', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'have', 'ie', 'family', 'problems', 'relationship', 'problems', 'problems', 'fitting', 'yep', 'episode', 'have', 'little', 'lesson', 'it-and', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'also', 'very', 'funny-', 'Being', 'fan', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Clerks', ""'d"", 'think', 'Nick', 'cartoon', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'thing', 'make', 'well', 'let', 'tell', 'seeing', 'Euguene', 'fall', 'hole', 'then', 'be', 'well', 'enough', 'yell', 'out', 'quot', ""'M"", 'OK', 'quot', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'Stewie', 'yelling', 'quot', 'DAMN', 'YOU', 'ALL', 'VICTORY', 'IS', 'MINE', 'quot', 'Anyway', 'movie-', 'basically', 'was', 'same', 'thing', 'quot', 'Save', 'Mighty', 'Pete', 'quot', 'episode-', 'big', 'corporation', 'tear', 'down', 'neighborhood', 'course', 'Helga', 'dad', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'quot', 'Big', 'Bob', 'Pataki', 'quot', 'joins', 'then', 'Arnold', 'amp', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'stop', 'Yea', 'u', 'can', 'kinda', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'gon', 'happen', 'easily', 'Also', 'Euguene', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'enough', 'time', 'favorite', 'character', 'well', 'little', 'quot', 'singing', 'quot', 'part', 'WAS', 'hillarious', 'Curly', 'was', ""n't"", 'other', 'favorite', 'character', 'Chocolate', 'Boy', 'haha', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'definitley', 'take', 'show', 'anydayGive', 'Hey', 'Arnold', 'shot', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'it-', 'very', 'funny', 'realistic', 'show', 'well', 'really', 'not', 'part', 'quot', 'new', 'nicktoons', 'quot', 'been', '1997']",Hey Arnold - The Movie
