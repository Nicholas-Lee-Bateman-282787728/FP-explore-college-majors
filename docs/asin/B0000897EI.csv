736667,A2V45E1ICTAJC7,B0000897EI,A reviewer,"[7, 9]","I bought this movie on the strength of seeing Gael Garcia Bernal in the cast list. Gael Garcia Bernal, for those not familiar with him, is an amazing (and very sexy) Mexican actor who is in the wonderful film ""Amores Perros."" His strong and really amusing performance in this film was the thing I liked best about this movie, and he is only in a couple of scenes. More screen time with him and John Hannah would have been great as they flit on screen and off too quickly and without much explanation. Monica Potter is lovely and believable. David Boreanaz is funny as an obsessive orthopedist who likes Lucy, but can't seem to keep his eyes (and hands) off other women while thinking some things about Lucy would be better if only changed 'one little bit.' He likes Lucy, but doesn't like her for her. Henry Thomas was a likeable character but seemed too besotted too quickly. At times I felt the chemistry between him and Lucy was manufactured, though they were charming-looking together on screen. The film jumps all over the place and at one point you are whisked from cold, wintry New York to sunny Miami (while the caption on the screen had just said ""January"") without any introduction into why Lucy is there when she just fell into the snow drunk in the previous scene. The film takes on too much too quickly, and at 97 minutes seems too short. It would have been great if 20 minutes or so were to have been added to the film to flesh out some of the relationships and encounters. Anthony La Paglia is too stereotypical of a ""Guido"" type and I found his screen presence annoying. The scene where Lucy runs into her parents while on her first date with Henry Thomas and is forced into going to her parents' apartment to watch home movies of her as a kid makes for a very funny and classic scene. If you like David Boreanaz or Gael Garcia Bernal you will not be disappointed, but note that David Boreanaz's character in ""I'm with Lucy"" is nothing like ""Angel."" I would compare this to ""Serendipity"" or ""The Very Thought of You,"" as this is very similar territory and familiar material. It's funny and entertaining with great moments and decent performances, but left me feeling like it was all appetizer and no entree.",3,"Nice idea, but needs more substance...",1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,2223,"['bought', 'movie', 'strength', 'seeing', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'cast', 'list', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'not', 'familiar', 'amazing', 'very', 'sexy', 'Mexican', 'actor', 'who', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Amores', 'Perros', 'strong', 'really', 'amusing', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'thing', 'liked', 'best', 'movie', 'only', 'couple', 'scenes', 'More', 'screen', 'time', 'John', 'Hannah', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'flit', 'screen', 'too', 'quickly', 'much', 'explanation', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'lovely', 'believable', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'funny', 'obsessive', 'orthopedist', 'who', 'Lucy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'eyes', 'hands', 'other', 'women', 'thinking', 'things', 'Lucy', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'only', 'changed', ""'one"", 'little', 'bit', 'Lucy', ""n't"", 'like', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'was', 'likeable', 'character', 'seemed', 'too', 'besotted', 'too', 'quickly', 'times', 'felt', 'chemistry', 'Lucy', 'was', 'manufactured', 'were', 'charming-looking', 'together', 'screen', 'film', 'place', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'whisked', 'cold', 'wintry', 'New', 'York', 'sunny', 'Miami', 'caption', 'screen', 'had', 'just', 'said', 'January', 'introduction', 'why', 'Lucy', 'there', 'when', 'just', 'fell', 'snow', 'drunk', 'previous', 'scene', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', '97', 'minutes', 'too', 'short', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'were', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'film', 'flesh', 'out', 'relationships', 'encounters', 'Anthony', 'La', 'Paglia', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'Guido', 'type', 'found', 'screen', 'presence', 'annoying', 'scene', 'where', 'Lucy', 'parents', 'first', 'date', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'forced', 'going', 'parents', 'apartment', 'watch', 'home', 'movies', 'kid', 'very', 'funny', 'classic', 'scene', 'like', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'note', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'character', ""'m"", 'Lucy', 'nothing', 'Angel', 'would', 'compare', 'Serendipity', 'Very', 'Thought', 'very', 'similar', 'territory', 'familiar', 'material', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'great', 'moments', 'decent', 'performances', 'left', 'feeling', 'was', 'appetizer', 'entree']",N/A

736675,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,B0000897EI,"""eurotrashgirl""","[3, 3]","I'm With Lucy is a recent romantic comedy starring the little known comic actress Monica Potter, who looks slightly like a blonde Julia Roberts.The film's premise is that the newly-single Lucy (Potter) goes on dates with five different men to see if any of them will work out better with her than her ex, who dumps her in a humiliating fashion during the first few frames of the film in an elevator in front of a bunch of strangers. This was the first sign for me that something was 'off' in this film. Many facets of it, especially in the first half-hour to an hour were frankly a little strange/not very well-thought out... by that I mean a distinct lack of realism, both in the acting and the situations presented. For example, who would really break up with someone, without looking at them (looking straight ahead, at the camera), while giving them a list of personal, embarrassing reasons they were doing so, in front of an elevator full of people they don't know? When Lucy meets her parents on the street with one of her dates, too, her expression is not one we would associate with someone meeting their parents by chance on the street.. she looks at them like they are strangers.The first 'dates' fly by, you see one brief exchange between Lucy and a man, a few lines of dialogue at most, then it's 'on to the next.' As I was watching these, I thought to myself, god where's the director, the editor, the acting coach, it was awful.. but then, after a while, things started to come together and you do see Lucy back on each date, with each different man, in different situations and with different problems/solutions/comic exchanges in each. So it did get better, thank goodness!Another quirky thing was the timing.. in the cases of most of the men, the outing was supposed to have been only one 'date'.. yet the film showed the two (for each segment) doing like five things in a row, very unlikely for a first 'date.' Ie: going on a long drive, fishing, playing tennis, at a beach, etc... all in the daylight.. strange. The timing just never felt quite right, it started to feel too much like a film, and I was focusing on that too much for it to have been done well overall (watching a really good, engaging film, I find, one forgets that one is watching a film at all, until the film ends and the credits start to roll.. and not a moment before).. so this irked me quite a bit.One more complaint is that the secondary characters, especially Lucy's female friends, were introduced for long enough in the beginning for us to expect that they would stay in the picture longer, so to speak, but they fell off the radar completely and didn't really return til the very last scene.. another fault in directing/editing I would say.That said, the movie grew on me quite a bit as it went along, and with some of the most talented male actors around as Lucy's five dates, there was a lot to work with, and the film came together by the end (to an extent).Standouts in the male actors would be Gael Garcia Bernal, the gorgeous Mexican actor (Y Tu Mama Tambien) who here plays a sexy playwright with a very cool (but again, also very unrealistic/unlikely) pad complete with a stream running through it and a host of tropical plants. His extremely sensual and sexy character has no problem bedding down with Lucy, and he does, again and again. She starts to wonder if there might be more to a relationship, however, and though she enjoys their encounter, seems to get a little bored with it all. The funniest/best/most classic scene in the film shows her and Bernal in post-coital bliss for the umpteenth time.. and they start talking about one of his plays. She asks him, ""so, there was this one character, he also does something you do,"" (I forget what it was) and he says, ""yes, it was an autobiographical play."" ""And the character's name was the same as yours,"" she says. ""Yes,"" he says, deadpan. ""And he believed he was the incarnation of Julius Caesar,"" ""Uh.. yes.."" he says in his sweet Mexican accent. Needless to say, very soon in another scene in his kitchen as the two are preparing dinner together, she says, quite expectedly, ""I think we need to get to know each other a little better."" Too much time between the sheets and not enough talking made for an interesting situation, to say the least. Bernal played his part quite well, and I look forward to seeing more of his work in American films.The other standout bloke was Henry Thomas (yes, *that* Henry Thomas (of ET fame)), who was appropriately sweet, cute, and mellow and truly cared for Lucy. The more he was in the film, the better it got, and the relationship between the two of them was quite believable.Other actors in the film were the usually likeable, talented Anthony LaPaglia (of tv's Without a Trace), in a really annoying but somewhat funny role as an aging baseball icon, tv actor David Boreanaz, and the Scottish actor John Hannah (Sliding Doors, Four Weddings and a Funeral).I give it 2 1/2 stars, and for the patient romantic comedy buff, it could be worth a watch.",3,"Odd, slow to engage, but in the end quite sweet & affecting",1053302400,"05 19, 2003",2003,5050,"[""'m"",

I'M WITH LUCY is a pleasant enough bit of fluff about a young woman recovering from love lost, trying to cope with five different blind dates arranged by her friends to bouy her spirits. Yes she ends up marrying one of them, but it is the play of courtship dances and dilemmas that brings what little originality to the film that exists.  Monica Potter is attractive and a good actresss who needs a good director to keep her focused: there is a feeling that this role was written with a gene pool of Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts in mind.  The men's roles are fairly well fleshed out by such fine actors as Anthony LaPaglia, Henry Thomas, and John Hannah.But the real reason to pay attention to this movie is the cameo appearance by Gael Garcia Bernal, one of the brightest lights to hit the screen in years.

736680,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000897EI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[25, 27]","""I'm With Lucy"" is not a great romantic comedy but I swear it is worth watching a lot more than many of the movies in this genre that I have seen in recent years with bigger stars (e.g., ""Maid in Manhattan"").  In fact, this 2002 film has exactly what was missing in the last romantic comedy I saw, ""Chasing Liberty,"" which was a grand romantic gesture.  The Mandy Moore film sets up the situation for the grand romantic gesture but fails to deliver.  Meanwhile, this film starring Monica Potter not only has a pretty great grand romantic gesture, it actually comes as something of a surprise in the film.The story first time screenwriter Eric Pomerance has to tell is about Lucy, who is about to get married when we first meet her.  We learn that after being dumped by her boyfriend under circumstances that would send most young women to hide under their covers for at least a year, Lucy is set up with five blind dates over the course of that year by her sister.  One of these five, we are told, will end up marrying Lucy and obviously we are supposed to see if we can figure out who is Mr. Right before our heroine does.We are introduced to the five blind dates in quick succession, which sets up the logic of the film as we cycle through Lucy's five choices again and again.  First, there is Doug (John Hannah), a recently divorced entomologist.  He is simple and sincere but seems a bit intimidated by the train wreck that is Lucy's life.  Second is the steamy playwright Gabriel (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal), who is sexy as all get out and has a stream going through his apartment.  Third is Bobby (Anthony LaPaglia) an ex-Jock who cannot believe that Lucy (a) does not know who he is and (b) refuses his moves.  Fourth is Luke (David Boreanaz WITH A TAN!) a physical therapist who has plenty of other women interested in him if Lucy is not interested.  Finally there is Barry (Henry Thomas), a charming computer nerd.It takes a while for this movie to really get rolling because the storytelling gimmick gets in the way at the beginning.  All five of the blind dates are introduced as disasters so it is somewhat surprising that any of them get to the level where marriage is a possibility.  But part of the charm of Pomerance's story is that even the guy who makes the worst first impression might actually be a worthwhile human being.  Of course the other possibility, that some of these guys might not really be as great as they seem, comes into play as well.  You may have a favorite early on, but it is hard to really declare any of these guys out of the running, until the grand romantic gestures has you declaring game, set, match (and even then...).The jumping around does not always work, mainly to the detriment of our getting to really know Lucy herself until the last half of the film, but there are enough cuts that work to the advantage of ""I'm With Lucy"" to make it a worthwhile gimmick on balance.  More importantly, the film has a payoff that exceeds the set up, which is rare enough in contemporary romantic comedies to make it something to cherish.Final Note: I never really heard of this film before and like many people only stumbled across it because David Boreanaz (WITH A TAN!) is in it.  But I am not surprised that ""I'm With Lucy"" was under the radar because the trailer for this film is one of the worst I have ever seen.  If I had seen the trailer first I would have probably passed on this film, even with the presence of the actor formally known asAngel.

736681,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0000897EI,Lee Armstrong,"[12, 14]","Jon Sherman directs Eric Pomerance's first credited screenplay in this romantic romp.  Monica Potter who was both convincing & chilling in the tense ""Along Came a Spider"" with Morgan Freeman shows that she has a flair for romantic comedy.  Her role here as a lead is different from her supporting roles with Robin Williams in ""Patch Adams"" and as Nicholas Cage's wife in ""Con Air.""  Because of her voice and mannerisms, she will unfortunately probably be referred to as ""the blonde Julia Roberts""; but Monica is quite good in her own right.  For those who love this genre, this is a fairly good outing.  The revelation for me was Henry Thomas as a delightful romantic lead.  He certainly has grown up since the days when the world watched him as Elliott in E.T.; and although he's worked steadily, he sparks in this film with his dreamy-eyed portrayl of Barry, the man smitten by Lucy, who intercuts his childhood home movies with hers and shoots them up on a wall in the middle of the city.  Also strong, is the wonderful performance of John Hannah with his Scottish brogue as the recently jilted and somewhat up-tight date.  My daughter who watched the film was rooting for him to be the one Lucy picks.  His performances in ""4 Weddings & A Funeral,"" ""Sliding Doors,"" and ""The Mummy"" have created an excellent body of work.  Gael Garcia Bernal is certainly an outstanding young hunk; & director Sherman wastes little time before [getting] him down in bed with Lucy.  He's actually very believable as the young serious playwright and has a wonderful apartment with a stream running through it!  (I thought, ""That's my kind of nature; no mosquitoes."")  Australian actor Anthony LaPaglia is delightfully obtuce as the jockish baseball player.  Julie Christie gives a charming cameo as Lucy's mama.  Julianne Nicholson does a great job as the best friend.  The plot is interesting with 5 dates intercut, knowing that she chooses one to marry, and going through each date concurrently to see who walks to the alter with Lucy.  The DVD special features weren't that memorable.  I kept misremembering the title as ""I Love Lucy,"" but this lighthearted sweet film is a great diamond.

I was familiar with Monica Potter and liked her in &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot; (another fun romantic comedy starring Joseph Fiennes and Rufus Sewell) but didn't really know much about this movie or heard much about it.  This was actually much better and more enjoyable than I expected.The premise is pretty clever - Lucy gets dumped by her boyfriend and her best friends set her up on blind dates. Flash forward to the present where we see Lucy getting ready for her wedding.  We know she ends up with someone in the end.  So we see flashbacks as her 5 dates unfold and we get to guess who she ends up with.  On the surface all the dates look pretty hopeless (no chemistry, nothing in common, etc) but as the dates progress we find a couple of guys who may not be so bad after all.  It's a nice romantic comedy with a sweet satisfying ending.I would also suggest checking out &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot; as another movie that is fun and romantic.

She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has 2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy genre.

The film itself turns out far from a success, but actually, she is much better, and looks more natural in romantic comedy, and `I'm with Lucy' easily proves that. This lesser-known film is not going to make her famous, I regret, but it is still worth a look for her charms.The idea is both simple and complex at the same time. Lucy meets five men in a year, and we are told in the first 10 minutes that she is going to marry one of them. They are Doug, Gabriel, Bobby, Barry and Luke, played by John Hannah, Gael Garcia Bernal, Anthony LaPaglia, Henry Thomas, and David Boreanaz respectively. So who is going to be Mr. Right for Lucy? (By the way, there is a man No.6 Peter played by Craig Bierko who appears briefly in the opening. Could be a dark horse, or not.)So simple. And complex. `With `I'm with Lucy' writer Eric Pomerance attempts to break the familiar rules of romantic comedy, but despite its interesting idea, I don't think it works. The reason is just this: characters. Five male characters are all stock type, and few of them are round enough to show the depth. Some of the actors are also typecast. John Hannah is Mr. Nice Guy, and Hannah has played similar roles in the past (see `Sliding Doors' for instance) and Gael Garcia Bernal is a sexy guy with Latin background again.Still it is joyful to watch Monica Potter as Lucy who, in spite of her peculiar propensity for blundering, is likable all through the film. Surprisingly her acting becomes very touching when Lucy shows unexpected subtlety in her character - see when she leaves one of the dates, both knowing that they would never meet again. This sad scene (which reminds me of one brief meeting of Hugh Grant and Emily Mortimer in `Notting Hill') shows the brilliance of the actors, but that is when we are reminded of the fact that we don't need as many as five dates to make one good romantic comedy.With all good intention, good acting, and very good-natured heroine, the concept of `I'm with Lucy' is too ambitious for romantic comedy, which has strict rule - that is `Boy Meets Girl' & `Girl Meets Boy.' Five boys are good to make one good comedy, but you don't need five boys to write one good romantic story.
