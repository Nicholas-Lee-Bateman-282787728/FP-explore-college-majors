While the first few episodes left a lot to be desired, if you can get past these, you will come to find a show with incredible character development, wonderful acting, terrific story arcs and more...

1057633,A1CWV11YOHMXJ2,B000NJXG6S,Nathan L. Baker,"[0, 0]","The Show: 5/5Since it first came on in August of 2003 I was hooked. I mean HOOKED. I watched the original broadcasts of the ""summer season""--AND the weekend re-runs of the episodes that just aired a few day before. AND I taped them and watched them a 3rd or 4th time. It's almost like when you drive home tired, then can barely remember driving home--you just know you're there, and you're happy. Now, I didn't sleep through a minute of this show, but it does give me the feeling that it just flew by.By the end of the season, I didn't know how the creative team ended up where they did, but I was satisfied with the results. Then season 2 came, and, despite some minor lulls, I was satisfied by the end. Except for Ryan's hair, which still bothers me... Then season 3 came, with more lulls... And season 4 came, completely rejuvenating the series with Taylor, a revamped (and increasingly likeable) ""mini Cooper"", and a lot more fun compared to other seasons--more fun than most shows on at the time, really.The DVD set: 5/5As you can see from my pictures (I put up a lot on the product page here) the book is very well put together, and it really does hold up well. At least, it does if you handle your DVDs with care. You don't have to hold it like a live  nuke, but handle it as you would with any TV on DVD.The case is sturdy, as are the pages. A lot of people have complained about the cardboard slots, but I haven't had any problems with any sets that use this type of slot (Futurama movies, Simpsons sesaon 11, Alias complete series, etc). I suppose they could damage the discs, but you just have to be a little more careful. (And if you're really that worried about discs being scratched, you could buy something like theDiscgear Selector 80-Disc Value Disc Storage System - Blackto store the discs in a safer way. The set would probably be smaller if they used a design similar to the Buffy and Angel complete series sets. If that were the case, we wouldn't have such a nice looking display piece, with all the nice (and BIG) promo pictures that are used within the pages.Most of what I want to say next is pretty much covered in the pictures that I've posted here; so for the rest of my review, check out the pictures.To upgrade, or not?In my opinion--go for it. Then again, if you don't have any season yet (chances are, if you were a fan when it was originally on, you have them already) this is a no-brainer. Back to the point. If you have some or all of the individual seasons, this set is well worth it. Especially if you have a 16:9 TV. Season 1 looks great on a nice wide HDTV. For me, that's the main reason to get this set. The bonus discs are nice, and if you're a big-time collector of TV on DVD (like me) and you like to show off your collection (like me), this is a definite eye-grabber of a box set.",5,As close as I'll come to the beach...,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,2824,"['Show', '5/5Since', 'first', 'came', 'August', '2003', 'was', 'hooked', 'mean', 'HOOKED', 'watched', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'summer', 'season', 'weekend', 're-runs', 'episodes', 'just', 'aired', 'few', 'day', 'taped', 'watched', '3rd', '4th', 'time', 'almost', 'when', 'drive', 'home', 'tired', 'then', 'can', 'barely', 'remember', 'driving', 'home', 'just', 'know', ""'re"", 'there', ""'re"", 'happy', 'Now', 'did', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'minute', 'show', 'give', 'feeling', 'just', 'flew', 'end', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'creative', 'team', 'ended', 'up', 'where', 'did', 'was', 'satisfied', 'results', 'Then', 'season', '2', 'came', 'minor', 'lulls', 'was', 'satisfied', 'end', 'Ryan', 'hair', 'still', 'Then', 'season', '3', 'came', 'more', 'lulls', 'season', '4', 'came', 'completely', 'rejuvenating', 'series', 'Taylor', 'revamped', 'increasingly', 'likeable', 'mini', 'Cooper', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'compared', 'other', 'seasons', 'more', 'fun', 'most', 'shows', 'time', 'really.The', 'DVD', 'set', '5/5As', 'can', 'see', 'pictures', 'put', 'up', 'lot', 'product', 'page', 'here', 'book', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'really', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'least', 'handle', 'DVDs', 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hold', 'live', 'nuke', 'would', 'TV', 'DVD.The', 'case', 'sturdy', 'are', 'pages', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'cardboard', 'slots', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'problems', 'sets', 'use', 'type', 'slot', 'Futurama', 'movies', 'Simpsons', 'sesaon', '11', 'Alias', 'complete', 'series', 'etc', 'suppose', 'could', 'damage', 'discs', 'just', 'have', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'careful', ""'re"", 'really', 'worried', 'discs', 'being', 'scratched', 'could', 'buy', 'something', 'theDiscgear', 'Selector', '80-Disc', 'Value', 'Disc', 'Storage', 'System', 'Blackto', 'store', 'discs', 'safer', 'way', 'set', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'smaller', 'used', 'design', 'similar', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'complete', 'series', 'sets', 'were', 'case', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'nice', 'looking', 'display', 'piece', 'nice', 'BIG', 'promo', 'pictures', 'are', 'used', 'pages.Most', 'what', 'want', 'say', 'next', 'pretty', 'much', 'covered', 'pictures', ""'ve"", 'posted', 'here', 'so', 'rest', 'review', 'check', 'out', 'pictures.To', 'upgrade', 'not', 'opinion', 'go', 'Then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'season', 'yet', 'chances', 'are', 'were', 'fan', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'have', 'already', 'no-brainer', 'Back', 'point', 'have', 'individual', 'seasons', 'set', 'well', 'worth', 'Especially', 'have', '16:9', 'TV', 'Season', '1', 'great', 'nice', 'wide', 'HDTV', 'main', 'reason', 'get', 'set', 'bonus', 'discs', 'are', 'nice', ""'re"", 'big-time', 'collector', 'TV', 'DVD', 'like', 'show', 'off', 'collection', 'definite', 'eye-grabber', 'box', 'set']",The O.C.: The Complete Series - Seasons 1-4

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[77, 86]","Much like ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Dawson's Creek,"" ""The O.C."" is one of those series that is a true time capsule from the years of their broadcast.  The show was made for the generation of teens and young adults growing up in the beginning of the new millennium.  But unlike it's predecessors it wasn't aimed solely at teens, but at their older siblings and parents.  This is what set the series apart from the competition, and why it's first season was FOX's # 1 series.  Creator Josh Schwartz (almost fresh out of USC film school) created essentially a John Hughes-isq television show (if Molly Ringwald was 30lb thinner and had a no-limit Amex Card).  But the pop-culture quirks, loveable characters, and rich/beautiful sets was what made ""The OC"" the place to be.The First season starts when Sandy Cohen (a Public Defender) brings his newest client, Ryan home for the weekend to his posh Newport Beach House.  After a series of random events Ryan is adopted by the Cohen's and the first season follows his fish-out-of-water experiences learning the ins-and-outs of Rich society, and all the secrets that come with it.  But events conspire outside of his control as he and his new brother, Seth, shake up the popularity Hierarchy at their High School.The Second season takes the storylines and remaining characters from the first season and basically continues' their story's but with adding a lot more drama, subtracting some of the humor, and bringing 4 new characters into the mix.Season three is where the show lost its direction.  Having lost almost 40% of its main characters, and completely abandoning the comedy in favor of almost unrealistic soapy drama a dry spill hit `The OC' from which the show never truly recovered with the ratings and the critics.  But if the third season did anything it show's the gangs graduation from high school (IMO in the best Graduation Scene ever to be filmed) and the death of a major characters that allowed the producers to complete re-tool the series in season 4.Season four was more or less a renaissance for the series.  The creator returned to the show full-time (after a year hiatus) and the intense drama was dropped pretty early in the season in favor of some much need comedy that returned the show its quirky roots.  But unfortunately this wasn't enough and the show was cancelled; although the producers were given enough warning to write a finale that successfully and very-welly wraps everything up!This DVD collection includes all 92 episodes on 28 discs.

1057639,A33BOYMVG3U58Y,B000NJXG6S,TV Critic,"[2, 3]","This DVD set is a great package for any OC fan.  Especially with the added bonuses such as season 1 being presented in widescreen format for the first time.  Another great added feature is the season 4 blooper reel which shows that the cast still seemed to be having fun filming the show in season 4 that they had while filming season 1.As for The OC as a show, it wasn't Shakespeare, but it was a great escape from the hectic lives we all lead.  The stand-out performers from the series are Rachel Bilson (who made a smooth transition from making the character of Summer Roberts a b*tchy one-dimensional character to making her the most beloved characters of the series), Melinda Clarke (Julie Cooper could have easily have been just a standard antagonist,  but Melinda Clarke made Julie a character you rooted for, even when she was doing less than good deeds), Adam Brody (who's portrayal of Seth Cohen defined the term 'geek-chic'), and a breath of fresh air was brought in season 4 by the delightful Autumn Reeser (took the character of Taylor Townsend from being the annoying girl in season 3 to the lovable and neurotic love interests of Ryan in season 4).Season 1- The season that started it all.  The show debuted in August and went from being 'The new 90210' to being a pop-culture phenomenon.  The excellence of the first season might also have been the shows downfall since so much story was told in one season that the show sometimes had trouble finding material in further seasons.  The only lowpoint of the season is the character of Oliver, but the show quickly recovered and finished off the rest of the first season in style.Season 2- The show started off on a shaky note with the main core characters (Summer, Ryan, Seth and Marissa) not being together and functioning as the friends we fell in love with in season 1.  The show suffered from something that many other shows suffer from as well, it tried to introduce too many new characters instead of focusing on the ones we loved in the first season.  But the show came back together mid-way through season 2 and ended with an explosive finale.  Highlights of the season include 'The Mallpisode' and Kelly Rowan's amazing portrayal of playing the perfect mom of Kirsten to slipping to alcohol abuse.Season 3- The show kicked off it's third year tying up loose ends from the season 2 finale.  It then quickly kicked in to high soap-opera style by milking the melodramatic and losing the humor that the show once had.  Many see this season as the point in the series when people started to lose interests.  The show was no longer the fun escapism that it once was because instead of forgeting about ones own problems they were instead forced to endure the many problems of the characters on the show.  Most of these problems were brought on by the character of Marissa.  Her character over the course of three seasons went through more problems and storylines then most other character go through over a 5+ season series run.  The show finally seemed to be heading in the right direction in the final two episodes.  The season finale ended on the most shocking cliffhanger the series ever had.  The death of a major character.  Highlight of the season is 'The Graduates' this episode ended our core characters high school life in perfect OC fashion and ended on a note that no viewers saw coming.Season 4- The 4th season of the show brought The OC back to basics.  It beautifully combined the drama and the humor the show did so well in season 1.  In light of the tragic events of the season 3 finale they were able to bring the show back out of the dark hole they fell in to and had some fun once again.  Summers change from the spoiled Newport girl to the activist animal-lover was a delight to see and Rachel Bilson portrayed this beautifully.  Willa Holland and Autumn Reeser were both welcome additions to the cast bringing fun to the show in their potrayals of Kaitlin Cooper and Taylor Townsend.  Melinda Clarke was a stand-out performer in the show's final season.  Her portrayal of a grieving mother out for vengence was well done and her love triangle towards the end of the season was fun to witness.  As the show wound down many wondered if they could end the show in the same style they began with, luckily, they did.  The final episode perfectly wrapped up four years of one of the best teen dramas produced.  The final few minutes of the series can only be described as perfect, because it wrapped up each character in a way that satisfied viewers.  All in all, if you're going to end a series, you want to hope and pray you end it on a good note like the OC did.  To be able to have their final year be just as good as the first is a great accomplishment that the show runners should be very proud of.  Highlights of the final season are Summer's five-steps of grief scene, and the episodes, 'The Shake-Up' and 'The End is Not Near, It's Here.'Over all, I've enjoyed watching this series and seeing it's progression over the years.  While it had some episodes that were far less than perfect, for the most part it was always a show I could count on to entertain me.  If you already own the previous seasons in their individual sets then this may not be a necessary buy, but if you don't own the series yet then I definitely reccomend it.  An A+ set for such a delightful show.",5,Beautiful box set for a fun show,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,5361,"['DVD', 'set', 'great', 'package', 'OC', 'fan', 'Especially', 'added', 'bonuses', 'such',
