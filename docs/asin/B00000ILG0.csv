The picture quality is mediocre at best and doesn't show the great photography which made the  original programs so appealing.  The discs were very difficult to remove from the case, and you have to be careful not to damage them when taking them out.  One of the hubs which held the DVD's in place broke off after the set was played only a few times.  I wonder why a better DVD set of this series wasn't made for our region.  This is not an expensive set if you can get it at a reduced price, but one wonders if it is really worth the money when other nature documentaries which are just as good have been released on better material.  If you like David Attenborough and want to see one of his best documentaries featuring birds you will want to own this set, but you might be very disappointed in its quality.",3,"Great series, poor quality DVD's",1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,873,"['really', 'love', 'series', 'am', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'set', 'picture', 'quality', 'mediocre', 'best', ""n't"", 'show', 'great', 'photography', 'made', 'original', 'programs', 'so', 'appealing', 'discs', 'were', 'very', 'difficult', 'remove', 'case', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'damage', 'when', 'taking', 'out', 'One', 'hubs', 'held', 'DVD', 'place', 'broke', 'off', 'set', 'was', 'played', 'only', 'few', 'times', 'wonder', 'why', 'better', 'DVD', 'set', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'region', 'not', 'expensive', 'set', 'can', 'get', 'reduced', 'price', 'one', 'wonders', 'really', 'worth', 'money', 'when', 'other', 'nature', 'documentaries', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'better', 'material', 'like', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'best', 'documentaries', 'featuring', 'birds', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'set', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'quality']",The Life of Birds VHS

We have been watching, &#34;The Life of Birds,&#34; and have learned so much about them. One could never get this close to birds and see how they truly live in their own environment. Many of the birds highlighted do not reside in our state, but are worth finding out more about. Even if it has nothing to do with school, this is a must-see program for anyone who is a bird watcher or simply wants to learn more about them. We have not finished viewing this series, but have discussed starting from the beginning and watching them once again. The gentleman who narrates this program has a slight accent, so we pulled up the captions on-screen to make sure we could understand all that he was saying.

Moon,"[16, 18]","...or dvd compression, or whatever.Beyond the rather grainy/fuzzy look to a lot of the episodes, this is David Attenborough's opus to his favorite animals, the birds.  Well, I can't be sure they are his favorite animals, but it would seem that way from his treatment of them in this and several of the other 'Life' series.OK, perhaps a second complaint might be that we've seen a little of this before with 'Trials of Life', but unlike 'Life of Mammals' that alternatively feels too recycled or stretching too hard to find the weirdest thing we've never seen (IE the Golden Mole), 'Birds' gets right down to its lessons in Ornithology.Not that it's anywhere near as brainy as Life on Earth--I'm pretty sure nature lovers of any age will dig it--but it doesn't go for flash the way 'Blue Planet' (admittedly only narrated by Attenborough) or 'Mammals' does.  Common species do the job of telling the story Attenborough has for us just as well as the species from the 'wind-swept plains of patagonia'.  With the stylistic flourish paired down, Attenborough's love and enthusiasm for avians shines through and we get something that all the special infra-red cameras and weird post-editing couldn't accomplish.  Ultimately, 'Life of Birds' is both informative and enduring, while Attenborough's continued arguments for conservation and preservation of species will fall silent on only the most unfeeling viewers.  If Attenborough's goal was to establish a sense of marvel toward a group of animals we often take for granted, he has accomplished this and perhaps a little more.A strong series that stands alone or works well in conjunction with many of Attenborough's other works.

503833,ABDU537LDPT92,B00000ILG0,Imperial Topaz,"[4, 5]","When my husband purchased this three-DVD series, I asked him, ""Are you really  SURE you are THAT interested in birds to watch ten hours of programs about them ?""  But from the first hour, I was hooked.  Every single episode relates so many different, interesting facts.  Some things I had wondered about for many years, and they were explained.For example, why is it that the birds start singing the very second the first ray of sun comes over the horizon, and they go on singing very noisily for about 30 minutes, at which point they quiet down again?  (VERY annoying if you're trying to sleep.)  Well, the answer is that each bird knows all of its neighbors, and calls to each neighbor periodically throughout the day to be sure it is still there and well, and to be sure that no foreign bird has invaded its neighbors' territories.  Upon awaking each morning, each bird calls to it's own neighbors, particularly those of its own species, mainly to be sure that its neighbors are still alive and well.  (Most birds are blind at night.)  This exchange takes about half an hour, and is the birds' equivalent of our morning news.  That's why it stops after half an hour, when each bird has finished talking to each of its neighbors.  This is only one of the fascinating facts I remembered from this delightful series.

With nothing really comparable, I still believe this is worth the top rating, simply because of the labor of love David Attenborough put into it.What were those things I didn't like?  In ""Life of Birds"", with 5 minutes to go in every program, David would introduce the next program, but then would resume with the current program.  This, to me, breaks the rhythm of the narrative and is not consistent with the style used in ""Life of Mammals"", where he would introduce the next program only at the very end of the current program.  Maybe this difference in style also reflects the difference in time the two were created, ""Life of Birds"" seems to have been made much earlier, and it even shows in the inferior quality of some of the footage used.  Each program in ""Birds"" also lasts 53 minutes, while those of ""Mammals"" last only 48.  Those extra five minutes...I also think there was not enough attention given to other crucial parts of birds' anatomy, like the unique respiratory system that allows them to cope with the oxygen demands of flight.  Even the differences in ""white muscle"" of quail and red muscle of doves, for example, were not touched, and these would have given insight to why some birds are natural strong flyers while some are limited to short burts and spend their time mostly on the ground.  Differences in talons and beaks, differences in wing shapes, IMO could have been better illustrated.And in both ""Birds"" and ""Mammals"" I really can't understand why David Attenborough would go great lengths to show the rarest of species while ignoring the obvious: chickens, dogs, cats, cows and horses.  Just because these animals are domesticated and common in the backyard doesn't mean they're not interesting.And yeah, house cats are among the most destructive of bird predators.

503843,A873NN1HNDUG8,B00000ILG0,Minh Doan,"[112, 117]","I'll start with these words:  I was not a bird watcher.  I was not into bird watching at all.  My hobbies mainly involved computers.  I graduated in Computer Engineering.So why my 5-star rating on this piece of work?  Well, it is simply the most enjoyable long running documentary I have ever seen.Every scene in this set has been filmed as if each frame was a work of art.  Seemingly impossible close-ups of birds in flight, as well as incredible film shots of different species of birds in their natural habitat, have been taken throughout the series.  Also, remarkable computer animations were used to render some prehistoric aerial creatures, as well as to enhance some explanation about the bird's vocal chords and bone structures.  One would wonder if such attention to photography would warrant a &quot;Making of...&quot; film.But not only is the scenery stunning, Sir David Attenborough has a flair of teaching us the world of birds in ways that would grasp the attention of any viewer.  He does not go into complex, arcane description of each bird, but takes the time to introduce us to each species in a very friendly way.  No complex Latin description.  No dry description of the birds' characteristics.  Sir David Attenborough draws us in with his genuine fascination of each species.  He doesn't rely much on some birds' cuteness to get our attention.  He lures us with pure human curiosity.A sparkle of humour here, a tiny amount of suspense there, and an engaging soundtrack all add to the narration, creating a documentary that should be known for its superb structure in teaching us the birds' way of living.NOTE for DVD users:  At the time of writing this review, there is currently a DVD version available through the BBS website.  There are 3 DVD discs included, containing all 10 episodes.  Unfortunately, it seems to be restricted to the European market, since the prices are marked in pounds.  As you all know, DVD players can only play DVDs with the appropriate regional code, so it is unlikely that American DVD players can play imported European DVDs.

503850,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00000ILG0,OverTheMoon,"[2, 2]","This is the 6th entry in the David Attenborough Life series following The Private Lives of Plants. The groundbreaking first series Life on Earth was based on evolution and started with bacteria making its way up to modern humans over the course of 13 episodes. The Living Planet was 12 episodes long and dealt mainly with adaptation over a wide range of environments that also incorporated more Earth science along with the life science in terms of geology and environments. The Trials of Life was 12 episodes long and all about animal behaviour. Life in the freezer was 6 episodes long and specialized on the Antarctic. The Private life of Plants was another 6 episode series and focused entirely on botany.With Life in the Freezer and The Private Life of Plants Attenborough made a new move to specialize instead of following the 12-13 episode discipline that started with Clark's Civilisations and Bronowski's The Ascent of Man and birthed other great series like Sagan's Cosmos, Attenborough now decides to detach from the shorter episode format of Freezer and Plants (an such as was in previous non-life series such as The Tribal Eye, The First Eden and Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives) and goes for a higher number of 10 instead of 6 instalments on another expert theme. Attenborough concentrates on one animal kingdom, the birds, and it's a real wildlife bonanza with many moments to leave you speechless.While The Private Life of Plants was a somewhat still, though time-lapsed voyage, because they don't move very far very quickly, the Life of Birds is on the opposite end of the spectrum with birds darting around frequently to the point where slow motion is needed to see what just happened for the `blink and you miss it' moments. In this series Attenborough maybe visits more places and countries than all his series put together. Some of it though was covered before in Life on Earth, but you still want to see it again. Since birds do a lot of singing sound is of primary importance as much as the visuals, maybe even more so. This show literally turns your living room into a nature park with its superb audio. There are some sequences involving domesticated birds that have been imprinted and they can perform on cue, so you get some amazing shots, like birds flying with the camera. There is some CGI done for birds that are now extinct.Major themes include when to fly and when not to fly, the mechanisms of flying, finding food, meat eating birds, fishing, bird signalling, finding mates, egg laying, parental care and endurance.Overall it's an amazing production. Attenborough though is now 72 years of age and while he even appears swimming in some sequences, this is the series where his years are starting to show but its more than obvious that this isn't stopping him, not one little bit. The investigation and observations of birds is nothing short of stunning. This series also has one of Attenborough's greatest moments.  The Lyrebird that can mimic cameras, a car alarm and a chain saw. The final episode includes human intervention including some conservation efforts that are nothing short of gobsmacking. Attenborough rounds off by making a final call for bird preservation.

503856,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00000ILG0,Russell Fanelli,"[0, 0]","David Attenborough's series, The Life of Birds, is quite simply the best documentary wildlife program I have ever seen. First, hats off to the photographers who spent countless hours patiently waiting for that one moment when, for example, a hawk plummets from the sky to capture its prey on the ground. We watch in wonder as this magnificent bird folds its wings and falls at speeds of 200 mph and more to the ground to stike and then lift quickly the unsuspecting animal in its talons. On the other end of the spectrum we observe a hummingbird remaining still in the air while its wings are beating a hundred times a second as it delicately licks nectar from a flower. Before television we have never had a chance to see these wonders so closely and so immediately. These great photographers reveal the mysteries of nature hidden from all but a very few naturalists.David Attenborough is our guide in this wonderland and he treats us like a friend along for a walk in the woods or the frozen tundra of the North Pole, as well as the rest of the planet that he has wandered in his search for undiscovered truths about the habits of birds. Attenborough takes great risks on our behalf. With line and pulley he ascends to the tops of trees in the Amazon rain forest or the eagles nest high in the rocky mountains.Not a moment is wasted. Each minute of every program is filled with sights and sounds, facts and figures, and thoughtful commentary about the life of birds. We think of ourselves as the masterbuilders of planet earth until we see the weaver birds using spiders' silk to sew a nest using the leaves of trees and thatch carefully gathered to make a home for the eggs that hatch into young as carefully tended as a mother tends her child.Our DVD player gives us options no naturalist ever had. We are able to slow down and freeze frame extraordinary sights and study them carefully before we move on. Here is an education no book can match or field study replicate. When the last program ends we have the satisfaction of knowing that the whole show is available to us again and again to view at our leisure.Great is the only word to describe The Life of Birds and first-time viewers will be delighted by all they see and hear.

As entertaining as all the other videos were, Life of Birds is by far the best of the flock.As you begin to watch the series, it isn't long before you appreciate the amazing camera work, as well as the amount of patience involved in waiting for just the right shot. And with the amount of film that was shot, editing must have been a monumental chore as well. But what an incredible result. You get so close to the birds, and observe so intimately their behavior, that you may begin to grow pinfeathers.I had never seen David Attenborough before watching Life of the Birds, though I was aware of his reputation. For the first episode or two, I thought he was a bit quirky, bouncing around as he talked, wearing funny hats in cold weather, popping up in every corner of the earth to catch birds in their native habitats. His enthusiasm is infectious, and it's fun to see him occasionally interacting with the birds - in one scene he actually helps steady a bird who loses its footing while running up a tree. He lounges among huge flocks of birds and the birds walk up to him as if to say ""No need to worry, it's only David Attenborough."" But Attenborough would not approve of anthropomorphizing the birds. He knows his science, and by the end of the ten-part series, you will too.There are no extras on this three-disc set. However, in one of the later episodes there is a short section about the filming of the series. One cameraman spends all night in a precarious treehouse so that he can film his subjects at sunrise. There is a storm and lightning breaks off one of the brances of the tree the camerman is perched in, but fortunately not the critical branch.

After checking out ""The Living Planet"" from the library I quickly found out more about his work, and this was the first I came across. Seeing as how, long before I watched this I already had an enormous interest in wildlife, I was very pleased to learn loads of new facts (a common occurrence in Attenborough's programs) and even find out about species I had never heard of before!Some examples of this (for me anyway) were the Takahe, Kakapo and the extinct Moa (recreated with CGI, which is used for some other scenes too). Even species I was very familiar with, such as the Toco Toucan would exhibit behavior that was completely new to me. In one scene two Toco Toucans rob eggs from a tube-like nest with their amazingly long beaks, and I had always thought they were strict fruit-eaters! This series is just jam-packed with fascinating scenes like that. And, of course, I am still familiar with much of what is being presented, but that does not take anything away from the viewing experience at all. (if it did, what would be the point of repeat viewings?)A plus to all this, is the presentation, the cinematography is incredible. (eagles flying towards the camera through trees, a king-fisher diving to catch a fish viewed from under-water) And of course David's narration and on-screen presenting is very engaging, he's very enthusiastic about the material he's delivering.On another note, the music is great and really fits well with the programs, and I often find myself whistling the theme after watching it.There really is only one small complaint, which is the same as many others, that being the video transfer. It's not as good as others in the ""Life of"" series but it is not too bad and you easily forget about it once you've started watching it (due to how good the series is). Most scenes still look very clear and sharp. Only occasionally does the picture get really fuzzy. Also, this is a widescreen program, and to be presented in fullscreen (coupled with a less than stellar transfer) is what made this miss the 5 star mark. This is truly a masterpiece of a documentary, so to see it not given the very best DVD presentation possible is a real shame.Still, this is definitely a great addition to anyone's video library, and I highly recommend it!",4,"""The Life of Birds""!",1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2359,"['first', 'many', 'reviews', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'fantastic', 'wildlife', 'documentaries', 'checking', 'Living', 'Planet', 'library', 'quickly', 'found', 'more', 'work', 'was', 'first', 'came', 'Seeing', 'how', 'long', 'watched', 'already', 'had', 'enormous', 'interest', 'wildlife', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'learn', 'loads', 'new', 'facts', 'common', 'occurrence', 'Attenborough', 'programs', 'even', 'find', 'out', 'species', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'examples', 'anyway', 'were', 'Takahe', 'Kakapo', 'extinct', 'Moa', 'recreated', 'CGI', 'used', 'other', 'scenes', 'too', 'Even', 'species', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'such', 'Toco', 'Toucan', 'would', 'exhibit', 'behavior', 'was', 'completely', 'new', 'one', 'scene', 'two', 'Toco', 'Toucans', 'rob', 'eggs', 'tube-like', 'nest', 'amazingly', 'long', 'beaks', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'were', 'strict', 'fruit-eaters', 'series', 'just', 'jam-packed', 'fascinating', 'scenes', 'course', 'am', 'still', 'familiar', 'much', 'what', 'being', 'presented', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'viewing', 'experience', 'did', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'plus', 'presentation', 'cinematography', 'incredible', 'eagles', 'flying', 'camera', 'trees', 'king-fisher', 'diving', 'catch', 'fish', 'viewed', 'under-water', 'course', 'David', 'narration', 'on-screen', 'presenting', 'very', 'engaging', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'material', 'delivering.On', 'note', 'music', 'great', 'really', 'fits', 'well', 'programs', 'often', 'find', 'whistling', 'theme', 'watching', 'it.There', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'small', 'complaint', 'same', 'many', 'others', 'being', 'video', 'transfer', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'Life', 'series', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'easily', 'forget', 'once', ""'ve"", 'started', 'watching', 'due', 'how', 'good', 'series', 'Most', 'scenes', 'still', 'look', 'very', 'clear', 'sharp', 'Only', 'occasionally', 'picture', 'get', 'really', 'fuzzy', 'Also', 'widescreen', 'program', 'be', 'presented', 'fullscreen', 'coupled', 'less', 'stellar', 'transfer', 'what', 'made', '5', 'star', 'mark', 'truly', 'masterpiece', 'documentary', 'so', 'see', 'not', 'given', 'very', 'best', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'possible', 'real', 'shame.Still', 'definitely', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'video', 'library', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Life of Birds VHS

It averages out to 3 stars.,3,Video Quality Very Poor,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,437,"['information', 'video', 'very', 'interesting', 'educational', 'video', 'quality', 'terrible', 'HDTV', 'One', 'reasons', 'purchased', 'was', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'similar', 'video', 'quality', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'hope', 'someday', 'will', 'release', 'version', 'better', 'DVDs.My', 'rating', 'system', '5', 'stars', 'educational', 'quality', '1', 'star', 'video', 'quality', '3', 'stars']",The Life of Birds VHS

He and his crew go to extraordinary lengths to capture  footage of plants, birds, animals, insects, the earth never before seen,  in each and every series they create. The resultant photography is always top-notch, the narration by Attenborough always succinct, appealing, and with a dash of under-stated English humor, and the documentaries extremely interesting.Life of Birds is no exception to the above. It is fantastic. The series captures all kinds of birds in live action, eating, mating, drilling, flying, hunting, defending - all with astonishing clarity and precision. You will be wonder-struck at numerous scenes. Attenborough's narration is on point as always. The material is fresh, informative and crisp. You will find yourself watching the films contained on this 3-DVD set again and again over the years. Very highly recommended.",5,"Attenborough sparkles, as always!",1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,934,"['David', 'Attenborough', 'world', 'foremost', 'probably', 'most', 'well-known', 'wildlife', 'expert', 'crew', 'go', 'extraordinary', 'lengths', 'capture', 'footage', 'plants', 'birds', 'animals', 'insects', 'earth', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'series', 'create', 'resultant', 'photography', 'always', 'top-notch', 'narration', 'Attenborough', 'always', 'succinct', 'appealing', 'dash', 'under-stated', 'English', 'humor', 'documentaries', 'extremely', 'interesting.Life', 'Birds', 'exception', 'above', 'fantastic', 'series', 'kinds', 'birds', 'live', 'action', 'eating', 'mating', 'drilling', 'flying', 'hunting', 'defending', 'astonishing', 'clarity', 'precision', 'will', 'be', 'wonder-struck', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'Attenborough', 'narration', 'point', 'always', 'material', 'fresh', 'informative', 'crisp', 'will', 'find', 'watching', 'films', 'contained', '3-DVD', 'set', 'again', 'again', 'years', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",The Life of Birds VHS
