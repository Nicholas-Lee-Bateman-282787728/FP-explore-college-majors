But this one is different.  You will definitely be able to learn from this video as it is broken down quite well.This is in my 3 favorite hip-hop instructional videos. This one is better for club dancing.

Dance instructor Kelly Peters reveals his ""one-step-at-a-time"" method, broken down slow so the viewer won't need to rewind. With close ups, slow motion, split screen, and a reversed picture just like a dance studio mirror (when Kelly says ""Go right,"" he moves to your right) help one learn hip-hop moves to perfection.

Some of the dance moves are mature and suggestive but most children will have no idea about the steps they'll just innocently follow along.  I'm not certain whether or not this is a good thing. If I'd had the opportunity to preview this DVD I definitely would not have purchased it however, since I did buy it I can say that it was worth the money for the few days of rest it afforded my friend and her husband.
