The downside is that ""24"" helped the public get used to the idea that torture is a vital necessity for saving American lives -- an idea which most experts in the real world intelligence community overwhelmingly disagree. In effect, this television program has been successful propaganda for the rightwing and Bush Administration (regardless of what any actor may think of his role or makers of a TV show claim).",3,Thank Goodness for Torture,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,516,"['first', 'season', 'was', 'fun', 'concept', '24', 'novel', 'exciting', 'one', 'other', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'downside', '24', 'helped', 'public', 'get', 'used', 'idea', 'torture', 'vital', 'necessity', 'saving', 'American', 'lives', 'idea', 'most', 'experts', 'real', 'world', 'intelligence', 'community', 'overwhelmingly', 'disagree', 'effect', 'television', 'program', 'been', 'successful', 'propaganda', 'rightwing', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'regardless', 'what', 'actor', 'may', 'think', 'role', 'makers', 'TV', 'show', 'claim']",24: Season 1

Season 1 moves much more slowly.  Although the Jack/CTU scenes are good and forecast what's to come in later seasons, there is way too much of his wife/daughter's issues, esp. where unconnected to the main plot, and the same is so for Senator Palmer's family.  Those scenes could have been condensed considerably (or omitted in some cases).  So, Season 1 is good not great, so far (I've watched up to 6 p.m. = 3/4ths of it).

I really think that this season is the best amongst all four and if you are new to the series this is the best place to start.  24 is a very addictive show where you can't watch just one episode.  I turned my whole family into believers of Jack Bauer and we all watch this show together.  For the price you are getting 24 episodes spread out over 6 discs.  Thats pretty good considering many television shows have only 12-15 episodes.  Also if you enjoy this show check out seasons two and three, which are also available on DVD.

In fact, at many times the story gets downright ludicrous.  The acting is ok at best, and most of the characters aren't all that convicing.But the show is addictive and highly entertaining.  I'd put it in the same category as Lost - watch the first 4-5 episodes, and you'll be hooked.  It's extremely suspenseful, often having 3-4 different plotlines going on simultaneously, and Jack Bauer's character (while not exactly believable) embodies the characteristics of the 'flawed hero' that very much makes the viewer root for him.If you can sit back and enjoy something without getting caught up in nuances like how believable the story line is, then Season One of 24 is definately worth purchasing in my opinion.",4,Superman wears Jack Bauer Pajamas,1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,1304,"['First', 'off', '582', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'reviewed', 'item', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'large', '%', 'age', 'people', 'buying', 'TV', 'show', 'DVD', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'show', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'realizing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'useful', 'most', 'readers.But', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '24', 'set', 'definately', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'borrowing', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'someone', 'who', '24', 'highly', 'addictive', 'show', 'season', 'one', 'probably', 'best', 'season', '24', 'definatly', 'best', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'watched', '.It', 'have', 'drawbacks', 'overall', 'storyline', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'fact', 'many', 'times', 'story', 'downright', 'ludicrous', 'acting', 'ok', 'best', 'most', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'convicing.But', 'show', 'addictive', 'highly', 'entertaining', ""'d"", 'put', 'same', 'category', 'Lost', 'watch', 'first', '4-5', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'extremely', 'suspenseful', 'often', 'having', '3-4', 'different', 'plotlines', 'going', 'simultaneously', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'character', 'not', 'exactly', 'believable', 'characteristics', ""'flawed"", 'hero', 'very', 'much', 'viewer', 'root', 'him.If', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'something', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'nuances', 'how', 'believable', 'story', 'line', 'then', 'Season', 'One', '24', 'definately', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'opinion']",24: Season 1

Skip one episode and I find myself going back asking ""what brought that about?"".  Good acting, rational story line, with believable characters.  Not for the paranoid or faint of heart.  The show plays out like a well written novel of Tom Clancy style with a touch of Micheal Bay action and a pinch of Lieutenant Columbo ""Oh, just one other ting"", for good measure.  Warning, some scenes may cause awareness of your heart beating in real-time, dislodged in your throat, and fill you with the rush of anticipation of ""OMG, What next!"".It's good to find intriguing entertainment drawn on the borderline of modern day news with hopefully a fictional twist.

I knew what it was about but also knew I could never make the commitment to see it every week.Okay, here is the DVD set, lets take a chance. I popped in the first DVD already knowing that this about an elite anti-terrorist unit in LA and that the show plays in real time.I promised myself I would watch no more than one a day. Sorry no way. You absolutely cannot just watch one. I watched all 4 on the first disk in one evening. This is the equivalent of a book that you ""can't put down.""First there is the main plot, an assination plot against a presidential candidate. Then there are the numerous subplots all woven together with almost perfect synchronicity.Each episode is unbelievably action packed and contains at least one major surprise. Few full length motions pictures contain as much excitement as as many thrills as one 40-odd minute episode of 24. You'll find yourself counting the minutes, as ""I'll be there in 15 minutes."" then look at the clock and see that his arival will be at the end of the episode, then practically holding your breath at the interim scenes.The real time element is so different and innovative I wasn't sure that it would make all the much difference from a normally plotted show or movie but Oh my does it ever add an edge to it that accounts for its ""I can't only watch one"" addictability.I was very impressed with that element even if it not exactly perfect. I have a hard timebelieving that Jack could drive across LA in 7 minutes even after midnight, but who cares. it flows and it will keep you glued to the set. You won't want to miss a second.Ther story will rope you in and if you watch episode #1 you can almost walk away from it and say I'll watch #2 tomorrow. Once you get into #2 your only hope will be to force yourself to limit it to one disk ( 4 episodes ) in one sitting.Production values are superb for a TV series. Acting and writing are all top notch. I can find little to fault the show. The DVD is fine, good even. It has a few minor faults but nothing serious. Picture and sound quality are quite acceptable for a TV series and they presented it in wide format - kudos to the producer for that.Another reviewer commented on the set up of the disks, no chapter breaks, no previews and the like. The previews are not big deal to me since they'll only make it harder to walk away from a disk. I dont even mind the chapter breaks since it keeps the player on the time line. I have no problem with that at all.I would have liked to have to option of showing the ""previously on 24"" slice.

No matter how intricate or exciting the storyline was, surely television audiences would not be patient enough to watch the hour-by-hour account of one federal agent's mission to prevent the assasination of a presidential candidate on the day of the California Democratic primary.Unsure about this concept, I tuned in to the first episode in the fall of 2001...and became an instant fan of 24.  I watched about 22 episodes on first run...missing only a couple due to outside obligations or cable TV outages.  Now that I own the boxed set of Season One, I have seen the entire series and can now write a few words about it.Although it is very much an action-suspense thriller (closer to Tom Clancy than to Ian Fleming), 24's tale of vendetta-driven terrorists plotting to kill Sen. David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert)on the day of the California primary is also the intimate story of the implosion of three families.First, the Bauer family.  When we first see Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), the setting is almost dully domestic -- he's playing a game of chess with his teenage daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert). But shortly before he gets a call from one of his fellow agents in the Counter Terrorist Unit, we see the domestic tranquility is belied by some tension.  Kim is openly rude to her mother, Teri (Leslie Hope) and will soon sneak out to go partying with her friend Janet....which will be one of the worst choices she's ever made.  And as we watch the series unfold, we'll learn about the straining effects of Jack's job on the marriage and of Jack's affair with fellow CTU agent Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke).The second family implosion involves the Palmer family.  Just as it seems everything is going perfectly for Sen. Palmer and his picture perfect family, we see as 24 unfolds that all is not well here, either.  Skeletons from the Palmer children's past are surfacing on the very day that David Palmer seems poised to win his party's nomination for the Presidency, and he is forced to see how far his ambitious wife Sherry (Penny Jerald Johnson) will go to keep ugly family secrets out of the public eye.And finally, there is the Drazen clan. Serb nationalists who supported Milosevic's iron-fisted rule, they were targeted by American forces and lost several family members as a result of a covert operation to take out the Drazen patriarch.  Now they are bent on revenge and will do anything and kill anyone to get it.Yes, 24 does have its flaws (the travails of wayward Kim and Teri's amnesia are a bit over-the-top for some viewers), but overall this is a fine piece of television drama.",5,A Tale of Three Families,1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,2732,"['have', 'admit', 'when', 'heard', '24', 'format', 'entire', 'season', 'output', 'focusing', 'events', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'skeptical', 'matter', 'how', 'intricate', 'exciting', 'storyline', 'was', 'surely', 'television', 'audiences', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'patient', 'enough', 'watch', 'hour-by-hour', 'account', 'one', 'federal', 'agent', 'mission', 'prevent', 'assasination', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'day', 'California', 'Democratic', 'primary.Unsure', 'concept', 'tuned', 'first', 'episode', 'fall', '2001', 'became', 'instant', 'fan', '24', 'watched', 'about', '22', 'episodes', 'first', 'run', 'missing', 'only', 'couple', 'due', 'outside', 'obligations', 'cable', 'TV', 'outages', 'Now', 'own', 'boxed', 'set', 'Season', 'One', 'have', 'seen', 'entire', 'series', 'can', 'now', 'write', 'few', 'words', 'very', 'much', 'action-suspense', 'thriller', 'closer', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'Ian', 'Fleming', '24', 'tale', 'vendetta-driven', 'terrorists', 'plotting', 'kill', 'Sen.', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'day', 'California', 'primary', 'also', 'intimate', 'story', 'implosion', 'three', 'families.First', 'Bauer', 'family', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'setting', 'almost', 'dully', 'domestic', 'playing', 'game', 'chess', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'shortly', 'call', 'one', 'fellow', 'agents', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'see', 'domestic', 'tranquility', 'belied', 'tension', 'Kim', 'openly', 'rude', 'mother', 'Teri', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'will', 'soon', 'sneak', 'out', 'go', 'partying', 'friend', 'Janet', '.which', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'choices', 'ever', 'made', 'watch', 'series', 'unfold', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'straining', 'effects', 'Jack', 'job', 'marriage', 'Jack', 'affair', 'fellow', 'CTU', 'agent', 'Nina', 'Myers', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', '.The', 'second', 'family', 'implosion', 'Palmer', 'family', 'Just', 'everything', 'going', 'perfectly', 'Sen.', 'Palmer', 'picture', 'perfect', 'family', 'see', '24', 'unfolds', 'not', 'well', 'here', 'either', 'Skeletons', 'Palmer', 'children', 'past', 'are', 'surfacing', 'very', 'day', 'David', 'Palmer', 'poised', 'win', 'party', 'nomination', 'Presidency', 'forced', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'ambitious', 'wife', 'Sherry', 'Penny', 'Jerald', 'Johnson', 'will', 'go', 'keep', 'ugly', 'family', 'secrets', 'public', 'eye.And', 'finally', 'Drazen', 'clan', 'Serb', 'nationalists', 'who', 'supported', 'Milosevic', 'iron-fisted', 'rule', 'were', 'targeted', 'American', 'forces', 'lost', 'several', 'family', 'members', 'result', 'covert', 'operation', 'take', 'out', 'Drazen', 'patriarch', 'Now', 'are', 'bent', 'revenge', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'kill', 'anyone', 'get', 'it.Yes', '24', 'have', 'flaws', 'travails', 'wayward', 'Kim', 'Teri', 'amnesia', 'are', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'viewers', 'overall', 'fine', 'piece', 'television', 'drama']",24: Season 1

It has every emotion you can think of jerking you from &#34;please let's pause this so I can go take a nature break&#34; or &#34;please pause so we can eat dinner&#34;, to keeping your nerves tied in knots from the suspense and action. Happy, mad, ticked off, suspicious, dreading to watch the next scene, covering your eyes-but peeking between your fingers, pulling for the good guys, hating and wanting to kill the bad guys, we felt all of these emotions and many others!

599389,A1AP3A4UW8OJFV,B00005JLF2,Andre 2015,"[6, 9]","24 is a terrific TV series, no doubt about that. Sadly though, being a series also is its biggest problem, a series that needs to have its viewers glued to the screen for an entire season. Meaning, a lot needs to happen in these 24 hours.A great storyline built on a terrific idea. Just too much of it. Too many turns to keep us waiting for what happens next. A few less twists and episodes and I'd have given it six stars.You probably know all about it: A presidential candidate is targeted by terrorists. A special agent, Jack Bauer, tries to save both the senator and his own family which has been taken hostage by the same terrorists in order to force him to do their dirty work.Great acting, good solid camerawork, good storyline (at least in the beginning). Somewhere in the middle things start to feel too constructed.A few examples: The gangsters appear to have superhuman intelligence on their side, whereas CTU bathes in blunders. Of course you can also call it luck when the bad guys are able to recapture Kim, Jack's daughter, for the upteenth time when she is escorted from jail by the police. Funny enough, a few hours earlier, the same super gangsters were unable to find her after her car exploded a few miles down the road with a huge cloud of smoke attracting anybody's attention, except that of the talented terrorists.Of course there has to be a traitor amongst the good guys. This time it's the agent's best friend, the one he trusts the most (oh no, not again...) She turns into a deadly terrorist in the end. But her previous actions somehow never seemed to seriously interfere with Jack's work. I had the feeling that the screenwriter just turned her into a baddy at the last minute, adding constructed clues into the last four episodes to deliver  the ""necessary"" tension. Sorry, but way over the top if you ask me.Other obvious mistakes: Jack's wife, after having been rescued, is being left to walk around as she pleases in the building of the Counter Terrorist Unit(she is a civilian)... a few hours earlier she said that often she does't exactly know what her husband is doing for most of the time. PLEASE!Jack, when hunting a suspect, often risks too much by unneccesarily breaking his own cover. This is most evident in the scene where he, together with a female police officer, chases a suspect in and around a warehouse in the dark. When he enters the unsecured building, he doesn't hide in the shadows but stays in the open. The officer is shot, Jack makes it through.A few scenes later, the police office building. This obviously is the dumbest bunch of cops around, the way they let the ganster escape. But they have to be, the gangster needs to pull us into a next episode.The list goes on and on. Now you're probably asking, why then five stars? Because of the idea, the acting and the basic construction behind the storyline. It's amazing. Even with all the flaws. You want to know what happens next - or what the screenwriters have come up with.Best acting by Kiefer Sutherland as Jack, Dennis Haysbert as Senator Palmer and Sarah Clarke as Nina Myers.The dvd set is o.k. Sharp most of the time with occasional bad mastering in large close-ups, grey walls etc. and no chapters.... O.k. for discs released in 2002 but you'd think Fox would have settled that problem by now.",5,"Great TV show, but with too many improbable twists and turns",1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,3312,"['24', 'terrific', 'TV', 'series', 'doubt', 'Sadly', 'being', 'series', 'also', 'biggest', 'problem', 'series', 'have', 'viewers', 'glued', 'screen', 'entire', 'season', 'Meaning', 'lot', 'happen', '24', 'hours.A', 'great', 'storyline', 'built', 'terrific', 'idea', 'Just', 'too', 'much', 'Too', 'many', 'turns', 'keep', 'waiting', 'what', 'next', 'few', 'less', 'twists', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'six', 'probably', 'know', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'targeted', 'terrorists', 'special', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'save', 'senator', 'own', 'family', 'been', 'taken', 'hostage', 'same', 'terrorists', 'order', 'force', 'do', 'dirty', 'work.Great', 'acting', 'good', 'solid', 'camerawork', 'good', 'storyline', 'least', 'beginning', 'Somewhere', 'middle', 'things', 'start', 'feel', 'too', 'constructed.A', 'few', 'examples', 'gangsters', 'appear', 'have', 'superhuman', 'intelligence', 'side', 'whereas', 'CTU', 'bathes', 'blunders', 'course', 'can', 'also', 'call', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'able', 'recapture', 'Kim', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'upteenth', 'time', 'when', 'escorted', 'jail', 'police', 'Funny', 'enough', 'few', 'hours', 'earlier', 'same', 'super', 'gangsters', 'were', 'unable', 'find', 'car', 'exploded', 'few', 'miles', 'down', 'road', 'huge', 'cloud', 'smoke', 'attracting', 'anybody', 'attention', 'talented', 'terrorists.Of', 'course', 'there', 'be', 'traitor', 'good', 'guys', 'time', 'agent', 'best', 'friend', 'one', 'most', 'oh', 'not', 'again', 'deadly', 'terrorist', 'end', 'previous', 'actions', 'somehow', 'never', 'seemed', 'seriously', 'interfere', 'Jack', 'work', 'had', 'feeling', 'screenwriter', 'just', 'turned', 'baddy', 'last', 'minute', 'adding', 'constructed', 'clues', 'last', 'four', 'episodes', 'deliver', 'necessary', 'tension', 'Sorry', 'way', 'top', 'ask', 'me.Other', 'obvious', 'mistakes', 'Jack', 'wife', 'having', 'been', 'rescued', 'being', 'left', 'walk', 'building', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'civilian', 'few', 'hours', 'earlier', 'said', 'often', 'exactly', 'know', 'what', 'husband', 'doing', 'most', 'time', 'PLEASE', 'Jack', 'when', 'hunting', 'suspect', 'often', 'too', 'much', 'unneccesarily', 'breaking', 'own', 'cover', 'most', 'evident', 'scene', 'where', 'together', 'female', 'police', 'officer', 'suspect', 'warehouse', 'dark', 'When', 'unsecured', 'building', ""n't"", 'hide', 'shadows', 'stays', 'open', 'officer', 'shot', 'Jack', 'through.A', 'few', 'scenes', 'later', 'police', 'office', 'building', 'obviously', 'dumbest', 'bunch', 'cops', 'way', 'let', 'ganster', 'escape', 'have', 'be', 'gangster', 'pull', 'next', 'episode.The', 'list', 'Now', ""'re"", 'probably', 'asking', 'why', 'then', 'five', 'stars', 'idea', 'acting', 'basic', 'construction', 'storyline', 'amazing', 'Even', 'flaws', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'what', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'with.Best', 'acting', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Jack', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Senator', 'Palmer', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'Nina', 'Myers.The', 'dvd', 'set', 'o.k', 'Sharp', 'most', 'time', 'occasional', 'bad', 'mastering', 'large', 'close-ups', 'grey', 'walls', 'etc', 'chapters', 'O.k', 'discs', 'released', '2002', ""'d"", 'think', 'Fox', 'would', 'have', 'settled', 'problem', 'now']",24: Season 1

What remains is the quality of this incredible series.  Its well written, with extrememly great care to what these characters mean.  The entirely plot around David Palmer could make for a remarkable show or film in itself, as could all of Jack Bauers.  And without dropping any grave spoilers for those still privledged to have not seen it yet, the plot twists and grows with evolutions servicing these characters wonderfully.  I cant remeber thinking so fondly of a character like Palmer in quite some time, and certainly not on TV.  He is what I think everyone could ever want and dream for in a President, and yet still as flawed and real as any other person.  Just wonderfully played by Haysbert.  Kiefers Jack has an intense passion for his family, an incredible sense of urgency and deals just as he should given the circumstances.  Fantastic performance.I shall say that I thought that Hopper was not at his best here, and wow, his accent needs lots of work.  You are nt Count Dracula, Dennis.  There are also some tired bits of music spread throughout, hinting at a multitude of composers, but I dont know that for certain.All in all, its the most entertaining, suspenseful show I think you can see right now, and one that will have you watching all 24 hours damn near back to back (as I think its best viewed).  When the moments work, they are as tender and touching as anything else right now and the investment in Jack and David is unrelenting.Highly recommended!",4,The First TV I ve loved in a Long Time,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1584,"['think', 'concept', 'how', 'show', 'well', 'known', 'now', 'five', 'years', 'initially', 'being', 'aired', 'What', 'quality', 'incredible', 'series', 'well', 'written', 'extrememly', 'great', 'care', 'what', 'characters', 'mean', 'entirely', 'plot', 'David', 'Palmer', 'could', 'make', 'remarkable', 'show', 'film', 'could', 'Jack', 'Bauers', 'dropping', 'grave', 'spoilers', 'still', 'privledged', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'plot', 'twists', 'grows', 'evolutions', 'servicing', 'characters', 'wonderfully', 'cant', 'remeber', 'thinking', 'so', 'fondly', 'character', 'Palmer', 'quite', 'time', 'certainly', 'not', 'TV', 'what', 'think', 'everyone', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'dream', 'President', 'yet', 'still', 'flawed', 'real', 'other', 'person', 'Just', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Haysbert', 'Kiefers', 'Jack', 'intense', 'passion', 'family', 'incredible', 'sense', 'urgency', 'deals', 'just', 'should', 'given', 'circumstances', 'Fantastic', 'performance.I', 'shall', 'say', 'thought', 'Hopper', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'here', 'wow', 'accent', 'needs', 'lots', 'work', 'are', 'nt', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'Dennis', 'are', 'also', 'tired', 'bits', 'music', 'spread', 'hinting', 'multitude', 'composers', 'dont', 'know', 'certain.All', 'most', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'show', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'right', 'now', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'watching', '24', 'hours', 'damn', 'back', 'back', 'think', 'best', 'viewed', 'When', 'moments', 'work', 'are', 'tender', 'touching', 'anything', 'else', 'right', 'now', 'investment', 'Jack', 'David', 'unrelenting.Highly', 'recommended']",24: Season 1
599391,A3EW4TUSY1HAXC,B00005JLF2,Andrew Mcdonald,"[4, 7]","Except for Season 3, every season of 24 is worth renting but I think season 1 is the only season truly worth owning. Why?Well, to note the obvious, this is the beginning of the show and so unlike the other seasons, we're not supposed to know stuff that happened last year (or, in 24 lingo, the last ""day""). We don't know who Jack Bauer is and we don't know what CTU is, but we learn as the story unfolds.The plot is small but very effective. The life of one presidential candidate (not a major city or the world) is in mortal danger by terrorists who intend to kill him sometime in the next 24 hours and it is up to the counter-terrorist agent, Jack Bauer, to stop them.Big deal, right? Well, you're going to be very surprised and pleased how many twists and turns this story has.The beginning is essentially perfect. Some fans of the later seasons of 24 might grow restless because it moves slowly. But this is smart because it draws you in, develops the characters and, unlike later seasons, actually makes the story believable because, if this were the real world, you wouldn't expect something astonishing happening to Jack every 5 minutes. It successfully creates a gritty atmosphere of suspicion where we're not always sure who's good or bad and where there are not always happy endings.For the first season of a show I was surprised at how good the acting was. Except for possibly one or two characters they all give very believable performances and the chemistry is superb. If 24 Season 1 was a movie I would actually expect several Oscar nominations dished out to this group. Besides Kiefer Sutherland I was especially impressed by Sarah Clarke who plays Jack's loyal colleague Nina Myers.I really don't want to say more beyond that but I will repeat to you some wise advise that I heard before I bought this season:DO NOT read any more reviews on this show because some jerk might reveal a major spoiler.

599394,A295YBJ2KROL8Q,B00005JLF2,Andrew Shih,"[0, 0]","Each of the episodes is about 45 minutes long, so it's really an 18-hour action movie giving you 6 hours to sleep, plus there are 20 seconds of credits at the end of each episode giving you time to go to the bathroom or to grab food from the fridge.  As you can tell, I've been totally immersed and addicted to '24' and you will too, especially if you watch it over 24 hours or over a single weekend.  For fans of action especially that with elements of political intrigue and family drama, this is a wet dream come true.In terms of quality of acting/action, I would give it four stars.  Keifer Sutherland is perfect for the role of director of counter-terrorism who frequently departs from department protocol.  His associates, as well as the first-family-to-be and the terrorists all do a fantastic job.  The plot is filled with all kinds of twists and subplots while managing for the most part to be believable to a CNN-conscious audience.  The subject matter and the themes in the '24' are extremely relevant to our time.It gets a fifth star because it's such a great value.  Although [it] might seem a bit pricey at first, what you're getting is the equivalent of 12 movies for the price of 2.  And it has replay value beyond watching it in one weekend or lending it to friends.  See it the first time for the suspense, the second time as a mystery to look for clues with the ending in mind, and a third time just to see the action again.  The only reason I did not follow the entire series when it was on TV was because I don't like cliffhanger endings in between episodes, but that's why '24' was made for DVD because then you don't have to wait a week to see what happened next.  You can experience events as Jack experienced them--with a lack of sleep and rest and driven entirely by adrenaline and caffeine.",5,Watch It In 24 Hours!!,1036281600,"11 3, 2002",2002,1817,"['episodes', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'really', '18-hour', 'action', 'movie', 'giving', '6', 'hours', 'sleep', 'are', '20', 'seconds', 'credits', 'end', 'episode', 'giving', 'time', 'go', 'bathroom', 'grab', 'food', 'fridge', 'can', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'been', 'totally', 'immersed', 'addicted', ""'24"", 'will', 'too', 'especially', 'watch', '24', 'hours', 'single', 'weekend', 'fans', 'action', 'especially', 'elements', 'political', 'intrigue', 'family', 'drama', 'wet', 'dream', 'come', 'true.In', 'terms', 'quality', 'acting/action', 'would', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'perfect', 'role', 'director', 'counter-terrorism', 'who', 'frequently', 'department', 'protocol', 'associates', 'as', 'well', 'first-family-to-be', 'terrorists', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'plot', 'filled', 'kinds', 'twists', 'subplots', 'managing', 'most', 'part', 'be', 'believable', 'CNN-conscious', 'audience', 'subject', 'matter', 'themes', ""'24"", 'are', 'extremely', 'relevant', 'time.It', 'fifth', 'star', 'such', 'great', 'value', '[', ']', 'might', 'seem', 'bit', 'pricey', 'first', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'equivalent', '12', 'movies', 'price', '2', 'replay', 'value', 'watching', 'one', 'weekend', 'lending', 'friends', 'See', 'first', 'time', 'suspense', 'second', 'time', 'mystery', 'look', 'clues', 'ending', 'mind', 'third', 'time', 'just', 'see', 'action', 'again', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'entire', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cliffhanger', 'endings', 'episodes', 'why', ""'24"", 'was', 'made', 'DVD', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'week', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'can', 'experience', 'events', 'Jack', 'experienced', 'lack', 'sleep', 'rest', 'driven', 'entirely', 'adrenaline', 'caffeine']",24: Season 1

It tells you the exact minute and second of the action within the hour.  Each episode is one hour long.  But there's a problem.  Whoever filled in the digital clock sequences wasn't watching the rest of the show.  The result is that some scenes that in real time take a half minute, take 15 minutes on the digital clock.  Other scenes that look like they took an hour and a half take only 3 minutes on the ditigal clock.  Toward the end of each hour, when there's supposed to be five minutes left on the clock, the show in real time goes through sequences that are impossible within that amount of time.  Now you might ask, is this really bad?  Who looks at the clock anyway?  (Of course, it's hard not to look at the clock; it's the star of the show.)No, what's really bad is how sloppy and cheap this all is.  The clock has more screen time than anyone else except Kiefer Sutherland but no one gave the clock a copy of the script.  And the clock isn't quite as versatile an actor as Kiefer, who keeps a pretty straight face.  At least he's read the script.  Obviously the producers here weren't looking at all aspects of the production, and it shows in other ways -- in plot inconsistencies.  I wouldn't be saying all this if I didn't think that 24 deserved to be much much better.  It's well written, well acted, dramatic, intense.

Because I'd missed key twists, I didn't watch the full series, so I was incredibly glad when they released this so quickly.In my own time and at my own pace, I could watch how the day unfolded for CTU agent Jack Bauer and his family. I could try and figure out the villains of the show, and I could try to understand how presidential candidate David Palmer and his wife Sherry were working against each other on the day of the primary. Using the DVD, as well, I could go back and forth over the twists, analyzing things that I'd missed, and determining what clues could help me figure out what was going to happen next.&quot;24&quot; is fun - brilliant, suspenseful fun that keeps you enthralled for a very, very long day. It manages to juggle the fates of dozens of characters without much confusion. Few plot twists, with the exception of Teri's late-in-the-game amnesia, are completely out of left field. And the ending shocker is a payoff to anyone who's invested time in the show.The format and pacing of &quot;24,&quot; clever as they are, wouldn't work without the quality acting and directing in the show, though.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[9, 9]","Jack Bauer is the head of L.A.'s CTU (Counter-Terrorist Unit), and he's just received notification from the higher-ups that a threat to a Presidential candidate (the first black candidate) is real and imminent. His job is to thwart the attempt by all means necessary. This will be ""the longest 24 hours of his life.""But the terrorists are aware of Jack and know he's assigned to root them out. We quickly learn that Jack's wife and daughter are in danger. They're swooped up by splinter cells of the terrorists and locked away. Now they have some leverage against Jack, and they're going to use it. But they underestimate him. Having been trained in Special Forces before moving into law enforcement, Jack doesn't like being pushed against the wall. Fighting back is his only chance, for him, his family and the Presidential candidate.Meanwhile, other storylines are coalescing with this one. The office of L.A.'s CTU may be rife with undercover agents for foreign terror groups. Jack and his wife were once on the outs and Jack became involved with Agent Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) - the second in command at CTU - for a very brief time. Senator David Palmer (the candidate) and his family are having a rough time; they're in the middle of the California primary and Mr. Palmer's wife is enamored with becoming the first lady ...so much so that she's willing to risk just about everything to get there. Palmer's son may also have been involved in the murder of a boy who raped his sister, and the news is just now beginning to break. Palmer's enemies are closing in, trying to kill him and to kill his run for President. And as this unfolds, we learn that Jack Bauer and David Palmer were once involved in a military operation (as subordinate and leader respectively) that killed a Kosovo terrorist ...and, by accident, his family. Or so they thought.The family of the ""murdered"" man (Dennis Hopper, Speed 1994) may have infiltrated CTU and are prepared to do anything to get Senator Palmer and Jack Bauer.______________________________________________________________________________This first season of 24 developed almost a cult following. And there's good reason for it. This is acting well done and nonstop action at its finest. Just when a storyline starts winding down, they pump it back up with adrenaline. Keifer Sutherland (Jack Bauer) was a good choice for the lead character and all of the supporting cast are just as perfect for their roles (from Leslie Hope who plays Jack's wife to Dennis Haysbert who stars as Senator David Palmer, the Presidential candidate.)The complaints surrounding the series are justified if a bit unrealistic. Most have centered on the lack of realism when it comes to travel times in L.A.; the 24 hour screenwriters put everything at 15 minutes away from everything else in the big city. This is true, they do. But when you have to cover one hour per episode, you can see why they did this; they only have so much time to get new plots across and keep the story moving at a decent pace.It's great to see a quality TV series making its way into mainstream America. It's so rare for something like this; I was stunned to find so many people (mainly my friends, coworkers, and family) were equally enamored with the program.",5,24 Hours Lived in 24 Hours,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,3262,"['Jack', 'Bauer', 'head', 'L.A.', 'CTU', 'Counter-Terrorist', 'Unit', 'just', 'received', 'notification', 'higher-ups', 'threat', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'first', 'black', 'candidate', 'real', 'imminent', 'job', 'thwart', 'attempt', 'means', 'necessary', 'will', 'be', 'longest', '24', 'hours', 'life', 'terrorists', 'are', 'aware', 'Jack', 'know', 'assigned', 'root', 'out', 'quickly', 'learn', 'Jack', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'danger', ""'re"", 'swooped', 'up', 'splinter', 'cells', 'terrorists', 'locked', 'away', 'Now', 'have', 'leverage', 'Jack', ""'re"", 'going', 'use', 'underestimate', 'Having', 'been', 'trained', 'Special', 'Forces', 'moving', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'pushed', 'wall', 'Fighting', 'back', 'only', 'chance', 'family', 'Presidential', 'candidate.Meanwhile', 'other', 'storylines', 'are', 'coalescing', 'one', 'office', 'L.A.', 'CTU', 'may', 'be', 'rife', 'undercover', 'agents', 'foreign', 'terror', 'groups', 'Jack', 'wife', 'were', 'once', 'outs', 'Jack', 'became', 'involved', 'Agent', 'Nina', 'Myers', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'second', 'command', 'CTU', 'very', 'brief', 'time', 'Senator', 'David', 'Palmer', 'candidate', 'family', 'are', 'having', 'rough', 'time', ""'re"", 'middle', 'California', 'primary', 'Mr.', 'Palmer', 'wife', 'enamored', 'becoming', 'first', 'lady', 'so', 'much', 'willing', 'risk', 'just', 'everything', 'get', 'there', 'Palmer', 'son', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'murder', 'boy', 'who', 'raped', 'sister', 'news', 'just', 'now', 'beginning', 'break', 'Palmer', 'enemies', 'are', 'closing', 'trying', 'kill', 'kill', 'run', 'President', 'unfolds', 'learn', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'David', 'Palmer', 'were', 'once', 'involved', 'military', 'operation', 'subordinate', 'leader', 'respectively', 'killed', 'Kosovo', 'terrorist', 'accident', 'family', 'so', 'thought.The', 'family', 'murdered', 'man', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Speed', '1994', 'may', 'have', 'infiltrated', 'CTU', 'are', 'prepared', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'Senator', 'Palmer', 'Jack', 'Bauer.______________________________________________________________________________This', 'first', 'season', '24', 'developed', 'almost', 'cult', 'following', 'good', 'reason', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'nonstop', 'action', 'finest', 'Just', 'when', 'storyline', 'winding', 'down', 'pump', 'back', 'up', 'adrenaline', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'lead', 'character', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'who', 'Jack', 'wife', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'who', 'Senator', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'complaints', 'surrounding', 'series', 'are', 'justified', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'Most', 'have', 'centered', 'lack', 'realism', 'when', 'travel', 'times', 'L.A.', '24', 'hour', 'screenwriters', 'put', 'everything', '15', 'minutes', 'away', 'everything', 'else', 'big', 'city', 'true', 'do', 'when', 'have', 'cover', 'one', 'hour', 'episode', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'did', 'only', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'get', 'new', 'plots', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'decent', 'pace.It', 'great', 'see', 'quality', 'TV', 'series', 'making', 'way', 'mainstream', 'America', 'so', 'rare', 'something', 'was', 'stunned', 'find', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'mainly', 'friends', 'coworkers', 'family', 'were', 'equally', 'enamored', 'program']",24: Season 1

Watching this season on dvd is one of the best entertainment experiences you'll ever have. What makes 24 season one so great is the intensity and pacing of each episode. Each episode leaves you wanting more and more. Its almost like one long 24 hr episode that you can't turn away from. Its addicting, rewarding, surprising, fun, cool, suspenseful,and tragic. The show also takes more risks than other tv shows which pays off tremendously. Jack is an awesome main character. His violent bad boy side, combined with his good heart and love for his family make him one of the best tv protagonists ever. Later seasons tend to have crazy plot twists that borderline on the bizarre, but season one has one main plot that paces perfectly. What also makes this season awesome is how it is centered on family.

It is not politically-correct, it tries to show both sides of government intelligence, corruption, dedication, self-sacrifice, and it pulls no punches.The issues are compressed, so that gives the show an air of unreality; for in real life these things do play out, but with a lot of boring work in between.  Real intelligence gathering is a painstaking task involving thousands of deadly boring scannings of data which for the most part leads nowhere.  Or, the important data bits are often missed, until it is too late.  That fact is covered in the show, but only at moments.  For in the show, they have an unreal amount of success in finding the target;  but you have to allow for that, since it is a TV show.Else, the show rightly depicts the reality we face today with not merely the horrible Muslims, but with all other types of terrorism.  Islam is a terrorist ideology masquerading as a religion, for example: but most Muslims don't know the Koran and the hadith any more than Christians know the Bible, so most Muslims are as horrified by the terrorism, as non-Muslims.  That fact is covered too, and without apology.  The show is frank about the Russian and Chinese problems, as well as blunt about the myriads of groups who want to kill not only us, but any government, using its people as a means to gain leverage or crow about how its little group brings down a goliath.You will better appreciate the role of police, FBI, CIA, and all law enforcement as well as politicians, without rosy glow or cries of conspiracy under every corner.Most of all, we see the devastating effect of negotiating with blackmailers, with terrorists, and how easily our integrity to defend ourselves is derailed if only one family member or loved one, is held hostage.  We see how those few who sacrifice their lives to defend us, are likewise shafted by government and family members alike.It's a story which needs to be EXPERIENCED, and apparently the writers know that, by styling the series as if real time:  each episode is exactly one hour, and that's the amount of time over which the story's action, takes place.  That's why it's so compressed.Series is painful to watch.  But necessary.  Again, if you had only one series to watch to orient you to the reality of our lives today, only one series to pass onto your children, pick this one.",5,No good deed goes unpunished!,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,2583,"['could', 'only', 'choose', 'watch', 'one', 'TV', 'series', 'lifetime', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'series', 'use', 'teaching', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'one.This', 'series', 'reality', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'thought', 'possible', 'commercial', 'TV', 'not', 'politically-correct', 'show', 'sides', 'government', 'intelligence', 'corruption', 'dedication', 'self-sacrifice', 'punches.The', 'issues', 'are', 'compressed', 'show', 'air', 'unreality', 'real', 'life', 'things', 'do', 'play', 'out', 'lot', 'boring', 'work', 'Real', 'intelligence', 'gathering', 'painstaking', 'task', 'involving', 'thousands', 'deadly', 'boring', 'scannings', 'data', 'most', 'part', 'nowhere', 'important', 'data', 'bits', 'are', 'often', 'missed', 'too', 'late', 'fact', 'covered', 'show', 'only', 'moments', 'show', 'have', 'unreal', 'amount', 'success', 'finding', 'target', 'have', 'allow', 'TV', 'show.Else', 'show', 'rightly', 'reality', 'face', 'today', 'not', 'merely', 'horrible', 'Muslims', 'other', 'types', 'terrorism', 'Islam', 'terrorist', 'ideology', 'masquerading', 'religion', 'example', 'most', 'Muslims', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Koran', 'hadith', 'more', 'Christians', 'know', 'Bible', 'so', 'most', 'Muslims', 'are', 'horrified', 'terrorism', 'non-Muslims', 'fact', 'covered', 'too', 'apology', 'show', 'frank', 'Russian', 'Chinese', 'problems', 'as', 'well', 'blunt', 'myriads', 'groups', 'who', 'want', 'kill', 'not', 'only', 'government', 'using', 'people', 'means', 'gain', 'leverage', 'crow', 'how', 'little', 'group', 'down', 'goliath.You', 'will', 'better', 'appreciate', 'role', 'police', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'law', 'enforcement', 'as', 'well', 'politicians', 'rosy', 'glow', 'cries', 'conspiracy', 'corner.Most', 'see', 'devastating', 'effect', 'negotiating', 'blackmailers', 'terrorists', 'how', 'easily', 'integrity', 'defend', 'derailed', 'only', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'loved', 'one', 'held', 'hostage', 'see', 'how', 'few', 'who', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'defend', 'are', 'likewise', 'shafted', 'government', 'family', 'members', 'alike.It', 'story', 'be', 'EXPERIENCED', 'apparently', 'writers', 'know', 'styling', 'series', 'real', 'time', 'episode', 'exactly', 'one', 'hour', 'amount', 'time', 'story', 'action', 'place', 'why', 'so', 'compressed.Series', 'painful', 'watch', 'necessary', 'Again', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'series', 'watch', 'orient', 'reality', 'lives', 'today', 'only', 'one', 'series', 'pass', 'children', 'pick', 'one']",24: Season 1

Utilizing a novel premise, each season of 24 comprises a single day in lives of its characters, with each of the 24 episodes representing a one-hour time segment of that day. Kiefer Sutherland stars in the imminent role of Jack Bauer, a government agent periodically faced with enormous challenges within a single day. Each season is reminiscent of a fast-paced Hollywood action thriller, but it's only a busy day in the life of the heroic Bauer...Season 1 unfolds in Los Angeles during the California presidential primary as CIA agent Jack Bauer and his colleagues uncover a murderous plot to assassinate front-running candidate David Palmer. With only 24 hours to uncover the identity of the determined killer, Jack must race against the clock if he has any hope of thwarting the plot. Meanwhile, Jack is distracted by his crumbling marriage and the disappearance of his rebellious teenage daughter. The clock is ticking... Can Jack save the man who may become president? And can he do so while keeping his family intact?The 24 (Season 1) DVD features a number of breathtaking episodes including the season premiere in which the groundwork for the series and the season is laid. Jack plays chess with his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) before receiving a call from Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke), his colleague at the Los Angeles Counter Terrorism Unit, telling him to report in for an emergency meeting. Meanwhile, Jack and his wife Teri (Leslie Hope) realize that Kim snuck out of the house during the phone call... When Jack arrives at headquarters, he's informed of a plot to murder Senator David Palmer, the first serious African-American presidential candidate... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include (#8) in which Nina and Tony discover the identity of the mole who is working for Gaines, and (#23) in which terrorists threaten to kill Kim unless Jack complies with their wishes...The DVD Report",5,"An original, fast-paced series...",1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2058,"['First', 'airing', 'November', '2001', '24', 'quickly', 'established', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'solidified', 'cult', 'classic', 'icon', 'Utilizing', 'novel', 'premise', 'season', '24', 'comprises', 'single', 'day', 'lives', 'characters', '24', 'episodes', 'representing', 'one-hour', 'time', 'segment', 'day', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'stars', 'imminent', 'role', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'government', 'agent', 'periodically', 'faced', 'enormous', 'challenges', 'single', 'day', 'season', 'reminiscent', 'fast-paced', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'thriller', 'only', 'busy', 'day', 'life', 'heroic', 'Bauer', 'Season', '1', 'unfolds', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California', 'presidential', 'primary', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'colleagues', 'murderous', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'front-running', 'candidate', 'David', 'Palmer', 'only', '24', 'hours', 'uncover', 'identity', 'determined', 'killer', 'Jack', 'must', 'race', 'clock', 'hope', 'thwarting', 'plot', 'Meanwhile', 'Jack', 'distracted', 'crumbling', 'marriage', 'disappearance', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'clock', 'ticking', 'Can', 'Jack', 'save', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'become', 'president', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'keeping', 'family', 'intact', '24', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'breathtaking', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'groundwork', 'series', 'season', 'laid', 'Jack', 'chess', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'receiving', 'call', 'Nina', 'Myers', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'colleague', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Counter', 'Terrorism', 'Unit', 'telling', 'report', 'emergency', 'meeting', 'Meanwhile', 'Jack', 'wife', 'Teri', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'realize', 'Kim', 'snuck', 'house', 'phone', 'call', 'When', 'Jack', 'headquarters', 'informed', 'plot', 'murder', 'Senator', 'David', 'Palmer', 'first', 'serious', 'African-American', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', '8', 'Nina', 'Tony', 'discover', 'identity', 'mole', 'who', 'working', 'Gaines', '23', 'terrorists', 'threaten', 'kill', 'Kim', 'Jack', 'complies', 'wishes', 'DVD', 'Report']",24: Season 1

Not many will make it to the 3rd hour.  Especially if you throw back a shot when he says, ""hey, it's me.""

There were some annoying aspects and characters plus predictible plot moments.  However, on balance, the fact that this kept both hubby and me glued to the screen night after night, going through at least 3 episodes at a crack, is very telling on just how big a guilty viewing pleasure this DVD set is.  This is the story of federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) who experiences crisis after crisis in one very long day.  The pivotal point is that both Bauer and the African American presidential candidate are at extreme risk on this day in California because of some Serbian terrorists who are out to revenge past wrongs against them.  Their idea of revenge extends to Bauer's wife and daughter as well. Both hubby and I enjoyed the extremely devious wife, Sherri, of David Palmer (presidential candidate) whereas Bauer's wife was such a goody two shoes that she began to grate on our nerves.  Jack's key agent at the bureau is Nina.  He's also had an affair with her and Jack's wife learns of this while Nina is handling her case. Nina is a key character too, one who never looses her cool under fire. There is also a very attractive Serbian terrorist who is having an affair with an aide to the presidential candidate to get information out of her.  She becomes aware of being used and the ensuing scenes between these two, where she knows he's used her, are the very best in the whole set.  Kiefer Sutherland, like many top actors, has a wonderful, memorable voice.  He is marvelous as agent Bauer. Dennis Hopper is the key Serbian villain.

What brought me back to the show was my brother, who had watched it from the beggining and one night had it on when I had nothing better to do. I was amazed and pissed at myself for giving up on it so easilly, the show is simply amazing and the writers are talented people to pull togethter a show as complicated as that.Now as some of the reviews have pointed out there are some very stupid little twists in there that are just wrong, amnesia, and by now you all should know the impossible Nina one. But those are only small problems and don't put down the show too much.Onto performances. Sutherland is simply amazing in this show and shows a much better performance then any of his previous works. This guy convinces us that he would be willing to sacrifice anything for his family, he is also a very cool kick butt character.Elisha Kuthburt as the daughter is nothing too speacial, but she works great as eye candy, and every once in a while she will surprise you. Her character is one that will piss you off somtimes because she can act like a spoiled brat, but she always finds a way to make up for it.The rest of the characters are all pretty good.

Jack lives with his wife, TERI BAUER (played by Leslie Hope), and their teenage daughter, KIM BAUER (played by the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert). Jack and Teri had been separated for six months, whereas Jack has finally moved back in to work out his marriage with Teri. It is now 12:00am, midnight, where Kim has snuck out of the house to meet with her friend, JANET YORK, where the meet with two guys named, DAN and RICK. But this meeting goes awry, for the girls find they have been kidnapped. As Jack heads out to find Kim, he is stopped when he gets a call from his office, telling him to come into work, for an assination attempt has been made on a presidential candidate.That presidential candidate is SEN. DAVID PALMER (played by Dennis Haysbert). He is in L.A. with his lovely wife, SHERRY PALMER (played by Penny Johnson Jerald) and their two kids, KEITH and NICOLE, where David will be entering the eleventh and final primary, wh ere he had already won the first ten.Jack arrives at CTU and is given a heads up by NINA MYERS (played by Sarah Clarke). Nina's position at CTU is one step below Jack's sort of making her the sub-boss to the company. Nina's assistant is TONY ALMEIDA (played by Carlos Bernard). With the help of GEORGE MASON (played by Xander Berkeley), Jack, Nina, Tony, and the rest of CTU begin tracking down the evidence leading them to the terrorists who want David Palmer dead. In the midst of their findings, Nina and Tony discover a traitor within the office. The traitor is killed as Jack arrives at the Presidential breakfast, where he prevents the assination, saving Palmer's life.Throughtout the course of the day, Teri searches desperately for Kim. Kim has been kidnapped by a man named IRA GAINES. He has Kim kept in an isolated barn, where Rick, every now and then, checks on her, for he cares for Kim, as she does for him. Teri is kidnapped and thrown into the barn with Kim, until Nina and Tony help Jack find them. Jack helps them escape, where they are taken to a safehouse, where Nina asks Teri and Kim of how this has happened, until Teri realizes that, while she and Jack were serparated for six months, Jack and Nina had an affair. But Teri, through some rough thoughts, sucks it up. The safe house is hit by the three assassins, who planned the threat. One of them is a man named ALEXIS DRAZIN, who keeps in contact, with his brother, ANDRE. Kim wanders off, searching for Teri, who has amnesia. Kim heads to Rick's house, but trouble sparks as Dan's brother, Frank tries to make a drug deal, until everybody, including Kim, is arrested.Teri gets her memory back, as Tony saves her from one of the assassins. He brings her into CTU. Palmer and Jack, together, realize that Andre and Alexis are doing this for, Jack had killed their father, two years earlier, while Jack was on a mission in Belgrade and Kosovo, which makes Jack a second target. Palmer is a traget, for he authorized the mission. Jack finds out at an underground prison facility that their new prisoner is VICTOR DRAZEN (Dennis Hopper), the man Jack supposedly killed.Throughout the day, David tries to comeforth with a confession that Sherry has hidden: the death of a man, who had raped David's daughter, Nicole. His son, Keith, had accidentally killed the rapist, forcing Sherry to finally tell David that she covered it up, but David's forthcoming of the incident, only helps him win more votes for his honesty. But Sherry tries everything this can to take that away, for she only wants to be come the first lady. More lies and more defiancies from Sherry lead David into filing for divorce, after their 25-year marriage.At this time, CTU discovers that a second traitor is within their midst. As it would turn out, Nina turns out to be the traitor. She is helping the Drazen's in this whole ordeal, where they tell her to Jack that Kim was killed, leading him into violently killing Alexis, Andre, and Victor. He finds that Kim was never killed and is on her way to CTU, after the police find out of her innocence. Jack and Kim hug passionately, but they find that Nina has killed Teri in the CTU office.This show is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride and the best way to start off with this show is this brilliant first season. Some heartbreaking moments, yes, but this first season is outstanding. Kiefer Sutherland has always been a talented actor, but this time, he has really proved that he is the best actor out there. This role was made for Kiefer and for Kiefer only! This is one hell of a first season.EPISODE LIST (24 Season

599448,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B00005JLF2,Charity Bishop,"[0, 1]","One of the most intriguing programs to come out in a long time, 24 follows a single day in hour-long episodes to represent ""actual time.""The primary character is Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) of the Counter Terrorist Unit in California. Attempting to put back together his broken family, Bauer is called to the CTU when their department goes on high alert. There are rumors of an assassination attempt to be made against presidential candidate David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), who if he wins the primary could become the first black president of the United States. Despite the fact his daughter has inconveniently snuck out to hang around with some ""boys,"" Bauer heads to the office, leaving his wife to track down wayward Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) and bring her home safely. But there's been a glitch in the department. Higher powers believe someone in CTU has been feeding information to the outside.The primary suspect is Bauer's former flame Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) with whom he had an affair while briefly separated from his wife (Leslie Hope). They must work together to track down this would-be assassin, who is mysteriously linked to the recent explosion of a jetliner. Palmer's security is on high alert but the future president is dealing with a reporter whose news story threatens his good name. It involves the actions of his son in an incident four years before, covered up until she received an anonymous tip. In the meantime we observe the actions of the terrorist team as they make plans for assassination... and accompany Kim on her party night as it turns deadly. Having agreed to meet her girl friend's new fling for a double date with a stranger, Kim is horrified when the boys refuse to let them leave. Packing both of them into the back of the van and giving her friend something to make her high, they drive to south Hollywood without revealing their intentions.Reaching their stop, the boys force Kim to call her mother and say everything's okay and she's just at a party. When she refuses they threaten to inflict violence on her best friend. Teri, her mother, acknowledges the hysteria in her voice. Together with the other girl's father she goes out in search of their daughters, frustrated at Jack's absence in assisting her. But Bauer has bigger problems... two of their top agents have just been assassinated and the information implies a leak in his department. With a lot of luck, some keen intelligence and a touch of blackmail, Bauer must plug the leak, save his wife and daughter when both become terrorist pawns, and keep Palmer safe until after the primary. He must also capture the terrorists... before it's too late.The first episode of 24 had me worried. There was a lot of violence, some strong language, implications of former adultery, implied nudity, and several sex scenes, as well as a hint at a lesbian relationship. But after that, suspense and action took the main floor and left more problematic areas in the dust. The show is extremely tense and well written, leaving off in a series of cliffhangers. There are many characters but we have no difficulty keeping all of them straight. Each individual is likable and yet possibly dangerous; we witness deceptions and double-deceptions, red herrings, agents who could be working for either side, and family cover-ups. While her father deals with tracking down psychotic gunmen, Kim has a profound lesson in how dangerous it can be to land on the streets. She trusts a blind date and winds up in a terrible situation, resulting in the loss of her best friend.The integrity of David Palmer in particular is interesting when contrasted with his family's attempts to cover up his son's indiscretions. You can't help hoping he manages to avoid bad publicity and win his primary. Throughout the adventures Palmer makes genuine attempts to piece together his broken family. Even when tempted by an intern he remains strong and demands all of his employees hold to a strict moral guide. There are some foreseeable events; but the program keeps you constantly guessing and is difficult to tear yourself away from. I thought my workday was bad; contrast it with these poor people's adventures, and anything else would seem a walk in the park.Like all modern television shows, 24 does suffer from occasionally-graphic violence, mostly mild language, and a few sexual implications. The first episode is the worst. We witness a sexual tryst between a photographer and female terrorist in the jet bathroom, as well as Kim's best friend from a distance in bed with her boyfriend. The terrorist kills everyone on the plane via an explosion after parachuting out. Presumably when the contact comes to pick her up she's topless. The shadows keep it from being overly explicit, but it was unnecessary. Later she flirts with the assassin in the bathroom where once again she's topless. Her hair covers her breasts but we do see part of her naked side and back. This same woman, who appears to be bisexual, passionately kisses her lesbian partner. In the 13/14th episodes, we observe a sexual escapade between one of the assassins and a clueless intern. Once again nudity is evident but cleverly obscured. Immodest attire is peppered throughout the series, showing a lot of low-riding jeans, low-cut tops, and short, tight skirts.The two boys responsible for kidnapping the girls both smoke weed. They give Kim's best friend crack to ease the pain of her arm, broken when Kim refused to call her mom. The ringleader also refuses to pick up her body after she's hit by a car and instead leaves her on the street. References are made to rape in both non-graphic and graphic terms. Palmer's daughter was raped on a date when she was sixteen. Conversation about the incident never gets graphic but is repeat in many later episodes. In order to save her daughter from being raped, Teri offers herself instead. Discussion about her own abuse comes up later. Sexual dialogue is also present.Language is generally mild but also involves one abuse of Christ's name and repeat instances of the term ""screwed"" both in general and sexual terms. Violence is less brutal than the show's top-competitor, Alias. People are shot at close range with mildly bloody results. A girl is hit by a car, flipped up over the hood, and left to die on the pavement. Her arm is broken by a baseball bat. Agents are mowed down in a parking garage; often we believe someone has been killed. Kim is slapped and flung around by her captors. A few people are knifed or assaulted with other weapons. A man kills a woman in the hospital by cutting off the air in her oxygen tube and squeezing the plastic mask down over her mouth until she suffocates. A presumably naked dead body is found inside a bloody bag in a trunk. Bauer scans the imprint of a severed finger into the computer. We observe the bloody results of a pair of slit wrists. A man is strangled to death with a piece of wire in a bar restroom. Many people are shot and killed in the final episode.24 is an exciting series but has many flaws. Either watch all, or none... since you'll get hooked and be unable to tear yourself away from the plight of the main characters.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,7173,"['One', 'most',

599449,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,B00005JLF2,Charles S. Houser,"[2, 2]","""I promise you,"" has to be the most uttered phrase in this excrutiatingly tense psycodrama. Dripping with implausibility (people leave their cell phones on even as they are sneaking up behind people with guns who want to kill them), it is made compelling by its powerhouse acting, frequent plot twists, and paranoid visions of families challenged by relentless dark forces. I say ""families"" (plural) because this drama cleverly interweaves the destinies of several different families, not just the family of key character Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland), the head of the CIA's Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit. As the series opens Jack and his wife Teri (Leslie Hope) are trying to mend their troubled marriage when their only child, daughter Kimberly, is kidnapped. For this family, the events of the next 24 hours forces them to reestablish their bonds. Another family drama that unfolds is that of Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert). Jack's assignment is to protect the Senator and his family from a known assassination plot. As the day unfolds the Senator slowly comes to realize how little he knows the other members of his seemingly ""picture perfect"" family. And playing off against these two families are the Drazens, the terrorists behind the abductions and assassination attempts...showing, I guess, that villains need love too, and have family bonds as strong as ""good"" people (but I guess if you also watch The Sopranos, you knew that already). And yet another family is apparent in the mix--Jack's family of coworkers down at CTU headquarters. What we have is a complete smorgasbord of dysfunctional families ricocheting through a single day, clashing and combusting occasionally, but mostly proceeding according to their own perverse logic. Everyone's loyalty is questioned at some point, friends become captors and captors friends. But through it all everyone manages to stay in touch through cell phones and satellite technology. ""Patch me through,"" is the second most uttered phrase.As exciting as the series is, it does have its false moments. I found the frequent I love you's and I'm sorry's a little hard to take. And there's one scene when Senator Palmer manages to break away from his secret security protectors in order to conduct some business. He encounters a couple of vandals in a parking garage, spews a little presidential-timber type jargon at them, and manages to get away without a physical encounter. The scene felt like an out-take from ""Stand and Deliver."" Oh, and there's the de rigueur amnesia scene in which both the onset and recovery are the result of traumatic emotional shocks.Technology is ubiquitous and glamorous in this story. Gunfire virtually unending. It's tempting to say ""Don't anyalyze this story. Just roll with the punches and enjoy the ride."" But ""24"" has a lot to say about human values, the fragility of the family, the false faces we present to the world to achieve our equally false goals, the myth of individuality, and the myth that we lose our individuality when we join forces with others, and the arbitrary nature of risk and choice. Try watching the ""24"" episodes in quick succession. I promise you, when the ride is over, you'll have plenty to think about.",4,"Parenting, promises, protocol, pistols, and palm pilots",1035676800,"10 27, 2002",2002,3250,"['promise', 'be', 'most', 'uttered', 'phrase', 'excrutiatingly', 'tense', 'psycodrama', 'Dripping', 'implausibility', 'people', 'leave', 'cell', 'phones', 'even', 'are', 'sneaking', 'up', 'people', 'guns', 'who', 'want', 'kill', 'made', 'compelling', 'powerhouse', 'acting', 'frequent', 'plot', 'twists', 'paranoid', 'visions', 'families', 'challenged', 'relentless', 'dark', 'forces', 'say', 'families', 'plural', 'drama', 'cleverly', 'destinies', 'several', 'different', 'families', 'not', 'just', 'family', 'key', 'character', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'head', 'CIA', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'series', 'Jack', 'wife', 'Teri', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'are', 'trying', 'mend', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'when', 'only', 'child', 'daughter', 'Kimberly', 'kidnapped', 'family', 'events', 'next', '24', 'hours', 'forces', 'reestablish', 'bonds', 'family', 'drama', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'Senator', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Jack', 'assignment', 'protect', 'Senator', 'family', 'known', 'assassination', 'plot', 'day', 'Senator', 'slowly', 'realize', 'how', 'little', 'other', 'members', 'seemingly', 'picture', 'perfect', 'family', 'playing', 'off', 'two', 'families', 'are', 'Drazens', 'terrorists', 'abductions', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'showing', 'guess', 'need', 'love', 'too', 'have', 'family', 'bonds', 'as', 'strong', 'good', 'people', 'guess', 'also', 'watch', 'Sopranos', 'knew', 'already', 'yet', 'family', 'apparent', 'mix', 'Jack', 'family', 'coworkers', 'down', 'CTU', 'headquarters', 'What', 'have', 'complete', 'smorgasbord', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'ricocheting', 'single', 'day', 'clashing', 'combusting', 'occasionally', 'mostly', 'proceeding', 'according', 'own', 'perverse', 'logic', 'Everyone', 'loyalty', 'questioned', 'point', 'become', 'captors', 'captors', 'friends', 'everyone', 'stay', 'touch', 'cell', 'phones', 'satellite', 'technology', 'Patch', 'second', 'most', 'uttered', 'phrase.As', 'exciting', 'series', 'have', 'false', 'moments', 'found', 'frequent', 'love', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'little', 'hard', 'take', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Senator', 'Palmer', 'break', 'away', 'secret', 'security', 'protectors', 'order', 'conduct', 'business', 'couple', 'vandals', 'parking', 'garage', 'little', 'presidential-timber', 'type', 'jargon', 'get', 'away', 'physical', 'encounter', 'scene', 'felt', 'out-take', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'Oh', 'de', 'rigueur', 'amnesia', 'scene', 'onset', 'recovery', 'are', 'result', 'traumatic', 'emotional', 'shocks.Technology', 'ubiquitous', 'glamorous', 'story', 'Gunfire', 'virtually', 'unending', 'tempting', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'anyalyze', 'story', 'Just', 'roll', 'punches', 'enjoy', 'ride', '24', 'lot', 'say', 'human', 'values', 'fragility', 'family', 'false', 'present', 'world', 'achieve', 'equally', 'false', 'goals', 'myth', 'individuality', 'myth', 'lose', 'individuality', 'when', 'join', 'forces', 'others', 'arbitrary', 'nature', 'risk', 'choice', 'Try', 'watching', '24', 'episodes', 'quick', 'succession', 'promise', 'when', 'ride', 'over', ""'ll"", 'have', 'plenty', 'think']",24: Season 1

She is a great actor who I think all America has chosen her as their fav actor next to Jack. Moving Chloie from the series would be a grave mistake! In the last scene of 24 on the 8th episode when Jack is given time to try to escape by the US president, the very touching scene of a distraught Chloie & bloodied Jack saying goodbye brought me to tears!! I think Jack finally comes to see what a loyal friend Chloie has been & the last scene we see of Jack is his attempt to walk out but we all wonder how in the world is he going to do this without any friends & medical care.I'm glad I didn't get addicted until way after the 8th episode was shot as I can enjoy each one without commercials & stay up all night watching it until I can't keep my eyes open anymore!!

599459,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JLF2,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","The reason I say that is oddly enough, I'm actually a fan of Veronica Mars and Desperate Housewives, 2 shows primarily driven by women. Any guy mentioning they're a fan and you either get a ""that's cool man"" with a snickering later or you meet the progressive type that doesn't care and knows a good show when they see it. 24 in many ways is a show made by guys, largely starring guys and for guys, with some females getting in on it too. While it still suffers from the occasional implausibility(more on that later) it's still quite a compelling show.Jack Bauer works at CTU, Counter Terrorist Unit. One night he's called in because there's going to be an assassination attempt on David Palmer's life, the only African-American senator who has a real shot at the US Presidency. Through many many twists and turns, Bauer tries to uncover who's behind the attempt and stopping them, all in the space of 24 hours.By now you know the concept: 24 episodes in a season, each one taking up one hour of an entire day(well, 40 minutes since there's no commercials). Ordinarily, this wouldn't work but somehow the writers manage to keep things enthralling without having things seem implausible although there are exceptions. First forget about the fact ALL this stuff takes place in the span of 24 hours. Characters don't really seem affected as far as sleep or washrooms are concerned, then there's some story turns that seem like ""oh come on..."" and while I won't spoil it, a sudden case of....something just comes out of the blue.One thing I love about shows like Smallville, The X-Files or the Simpsons is that I can watch any episode in any order and still be entertained for that time. However, shows like 24, Alias or Lost practically require you to watch from the beginning. While all the episodes are captivating, it's rare for you to pick out a certain episode and re-watch it; it's like starting a book on chapter 7.

599467,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JLF2,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","At first glance, the premise of 24 seems like a gimmick - the events of the show take place in ""real time"", meaning that if it takes 15 minutes to drive from point A to point B, 15 minutes will pass in the show.  Therefore, the show requires lots of overlapping stories to fill the gaps that such travels bring.  In this case, thanks to the writing teams and the directors, the gimmick works and the show succeeds very well.  Without giving away anything that doesn't happen in the first few episodes, the main plot involves federal anti-terrorism agent Jack Bauer investigating a tipoff that says there will be an attempt on a presidential candidate's life.  The candidate, David Palmer, is African American and a current senator - are either important?  The subplots (which are all ultimately interlinked) include a coverup in the Palmer family about a suspicious death, the kidnapping of Jack's daughter, and the murder of one of Jack's bosses.  To complicate things, just before he dies, the boss tells Jack of traitors in his unit - but he doesn't know who they are.The plot weaves in and out of these stories, with a cliffhanger in at least one of them to whet the viewer's appetite for the next show.  The shows are action packed - obviously Fox believed in the show right away, because it looks like the effects/stunts budget for one episode would cover the entire season of ""Law and Order"" or ""CSI.""  There are many surprises - everything is in play, and any given character could be killed at any given time (except Jack, of course, who has to last at least until the last show).  Just when you think you know what's going on, the writers take a turn - they are unexpected (and unpredictable), but not unfair (they aren't just played for shock value).There are advantages and disadvantages to owning this series on DVD.  On the up side, there's no commercials or other distractions to take you out of the story - it's critical for a show like this that the viewer remains immersed in the show.  On the down side, there are places where the gimmick breaks down, and these are especially obvious when watching shows in close succession.  For example, at the end of one early episode, a girl is hit by a car.  At the beginning of the next episode (supposedly 5 minutes later), she is already in the ambulance and on her way to the hospital.  45 minutes after that she has had surgery, suffered momentary heart failure, and woken up to talk to the doctors.  Likewise, some characters apparently vanish - for example, the dark-haired girl who negotiates with Gaines in the first couple of episodes.  We see them drive off together in one episode, and then never see her again.  Similarly, the boss's revelations before he's murdered are ignored and/or contradicted by later events.  Finally, all the events seem to take place within a 15-minute drive of the unit's HQ (even in rush-hour LA traffic!)  None of these problems would be remembered by the average audience member watching the series over the course of several months, but are jarring when watched on DVD over a few weeks.These are minor quibbles (as is the fact that the DVD contains no extras worthy of the name).  The show is generally solid, with lots of great action and suspense.",4,Action packed and full of surprises,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,3251,"['first', 'glance', 'premise', '24', 'gimmick', 'events', 'show', 'take', 'place', 'real', 'time', 'meaning', '15', 'minutes', 'drive', 'point', 'point', 'B', '15', 'minutes', 'will', 'pass', 'show', 'Therefore', 'show', 'lots', 'overlapping', 'stories', 'fill', 'gaps', 'such', 'travels', 'bring', 'case', 'thanks', 'writing', 'teams', 'directors', 'gimmick', 'show', 'very', 'well', 'giving', 'away', 'anything', ""n't"", 'happen', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'main', 'plot', 'federal', 'anti-terrorism', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'investigating', 'tipoff', 'will', 'be', 'attempt', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'life', 'candidate', 'David', 'Palmer', 'African', 'American', 'current', 'senator', 'are', 'important', 'subplots', 'are', 'ultimately', 'interlinked', 'include', 'coverup', 'Palmer', 'family', 'suspicious', 'death', 'kidnapping', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'murder', 'one', 'Jack', 'bosses', 'complicate', 'things', 'just', 'boss', 'Jack', 'traitors', 'unit', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'are.The', 'plot', 'weaves', 'stories', 'cliffhanger', 'least', 'one', 'whet', 'viewer', 'appetite', 'next', 'show', 'shows', 'are', 'action', 'packed', 'obviously', 'Fox', 'believed', 'show', 'right', 'away', 'effects/stunts', 'budget', 'one', 'episode', 'would', 'cover', 'entire', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'CSI', 'are', 'many', 'surprises', 'everything', 'play', 'given', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'killed', 'given', 'time', 'Jack', 'course', 'who', 'last', 'least', 'last', 'show', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'writers', 'take', 'turn', 'are', 'unexpected', 'unpredictable', 'not', 'unfair', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'played', 'shock', 'value', 'are', 'advantages', 'disadvantages', 'owning', 'series', 'DVD', 'up', 'side', 'commercials', 'other', 'distractions', 'take', 'story', 'critical', 'show', 'viewer', 'immersed', 'show', 'down', 'side', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'gimmick', 'down', 'are', 'especially', 'obvious', 'when', 'watching', 'shows', 'close', 'succession', 'example', 'end', 'one', 'early', 'episode', 'girl', 'hit', 'car', 'beginning', 'next', 'episode', 'supposedly', '5', 'minutes', 'later', 'already', 'ambulance', 'way', 'hospital', '45', 'minutes', 'had', 'surgery', 'suffered', 'momentary', 'heart', 'failure', 'woken', 'up', 'talk', 'doctors', 'Likewise', 'characters', 'apparently', 'vanish', 'example', 'dark-haired', 'girl', 'who', 'Gaines', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'see', 'drive', 'off', 'together', 'one', 'episode', 'then', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'Similarly', 'boss', 'revelations', 'murdered', 'are', 'ignored', 'and/or', 'contradicted', 'later', 'events', 'Finally', 'events', 'seem', 'take', 'place', '15-minute', 'drive', 'unit', 'HQ', 'even', 'rush-hour', 'LA', 'traffic', 'None', 'problems', 'would', 'be', 'remembered', 'average', 'audience', 'member', 'watching', 'series', 'course', 'several', 'months', 'are', 'jarring', 'when', 'watched', 'DVD', 'few', 'weeks.These', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'fact', 'DVD', 'extras', 'worthy', 'name', 'show', 'generally', 'solid', 'lots', 'great', 'action', 'suspense']",24: Season 1

The show is based on the life of Jack Bauer(Kiefer Sutherland), a government CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) agent. The show is real time, a season is based on one full 24 hour day. There are 24 episodes, each episode lasting an hour, example: 12:00 A.M.-1:00 A.M.This show contains drama, action, shocks and twists. At the beginning of the season, Jack Bauer is told that an there is an assassination attempt on David Palmer, a presidential candidate, that will take place within 24 hours. While Jack is trying to figure out who is behind the attacks, his wife and daughter are kidnapped by the terrorists responsible for the assassination attempt. By threatening to kill his family, the terrorists want Jack to assassinate David Palmer and take the blame of the killing. What will Jack Bauer do?: Save his family and sacrifice David Palmer, or sacrifice his family in order to save the future President of the United States? This is only the first 12 hours of the season!!!I highly recommend buying the first, second, third, and fourth season on DVD. In my opinion, the first season is the best.

Of course, Jack's daughter is annoying (as always!) in this season, but plays a more believable role (than say, working for CTU on computers!).  Nina is great, President Palmer is great, and so is Jack's wife.  The great thing about 24, and definitely proved in this season, is that anything can happen.  Sure, Jack won't die, but anyone else can at any time.  Do yourself a favor.  If you have not seen 24 yet, go out and buy Season 1 AND Season 2 right away.

For Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) that would be a lazy Sunday in the warm August sunshine compared to the single day that makes up the debut season of 24, one of the most daring and exciting television series I've ever seen.Time - there's lots in a day: 1,440 minutes, 86,400 seconds, one spin of the earth. The attempt to make a film documenting an entire day, virtually in real time, might have worked in The Truman Show, but I'm sorry to say that my interest would have been less than enthusiastic if anyone other than Jim Carrey had been cast in the starring role. It's just that difficult to make true real-time seem exciting. But that's what 24 does. Going from midnight to midnight on Super Tuesday, the day that would-be United States presidential hopefuls find out if they're going to enter the horse race for the White House, the show's first season is conveniently made up of 24 episodes, each lasting one hour.John Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) stands a better than good chance of becoming the first black U.S. President, but someone's set up an elaborate plot to assassinate him on the day when his pending nomination is to become official. Enter Bauer, an esteemed member of California's counter-terrorist unit, and the only person with a chance of cracking the case.Although the time aspect of 24 could be viewed as a gimmick (it is), it's also what makes the show unique and sets the intensity of every episode. As the day carries on, the plot unravels and thickens, and the stakes are raised to near unbearable points for all the characters involved, you're left guessing what's going to happen up until the very last second. This is suspense at its best. Everything is laid out methodically, so that when surprises pop up (and they do every few minutes), they make sense. The writers are not afraid to challenge the audience's expectations, often taking the route least predictable.With everything that's going on, there's never a shortage of action, especially in the closing seconds of every hour. This is where a lot of the twists happen, as the makers try to hook viewers to tune in again next week. This is where the real-time format shows its greatest weakness. It's strange how everyone seems to get shot in the 59th minute of an episode. This may not have been as noticeable while watching on television during its initial run, but when you watch the whole season over a short period of time on DVD, it becomes obvious that the producers worked to pique interest at the end of every hour. The spins follow a time pattern, but it's still tough to figure out which way the spin's going to go.We live in an age of conspiracy theories and uncertain global relations. Who are we watching? Who's watching us? The first season of 24 is all about the loss of trust. Bauer, his family, his co-workers, Palmer, even the public at large see the most sacred and intimate of emotions wither away, sacrifices to the television gods, and to my delight.

Brown""","[1, 2]","&quot;24&quot; is _not_ &quot;like a soap opera&quot; except in the superficial sense of a story that more-or-less continues from week to week.The closest analog I can think of is a saga like that of the Monkey King being translated to a series format for Asian television. But I don't think there has been any series ever before envisioned and executed with the tight structure and story line of &quot;24.&quot;I made the mistake of renting episodes of the first season (now available at my Blockbuster on DVD). I had seen maybe two and a half of the episodes in the first season when they aired, then gave it up because I didn't want to watch it through to the end without having seen the lead-up. Watching it all at once is like reading a novel that you can't put down. And I realized that that's what this is: a novel, in cinematic form.The show is most obviously unique in the minute-by-minute gimmick. But the gimmick is itself deceptive -- going minute by minute suggests a naturalistic, &quot;slice of life&quot; approach, but in fact the direction and script are tightly stylized. (And because the show keeps cutting between different developments, it's not _really_ minute by minute.) The show is realistic and persuasive, but very highly selective in what it shows and how it shows it, always achieving the maximum effect by minimum means.This is a complete visual novel -- not a condensed translation of a novel, like a mini-series adaptation. It is a complete novel with individual chapters. No other series has ever done this. Many have elements of continuity, etc., with characters developing over time and various sub-plots developing. But except for two-parters, the individual episodes are almost always self-contained. Not here. That's because the goal is to present a visual novel, not just to cover a 24 hour period with minute-by-minute suspense. &quot;24&quot; is also the opposite of soap operas, whose stories never reach any closure.I also appreciate &quot;24&quot; for never thunking you over the head with the effects it is generating. It avoids cliche altogether and always assumes that the viewer will &quot;get it.&quot;  I think in the first season there was only one misstep, and that was the casting of Dennis Hopper as a bad guy with an accent.Somebody is going to figure out that the same cinematic-novel approach will work with other kinds of stories, not just something with a time deadline, and then we'll see more of them. Right now I don't think people realize something new has been invented here. A cinematic novel done from scratch. Done perfectly the first time out of the gate.",5,&quot;24&quot; IS A BRAND-NEW FORM,1039392000,"12 9, 2002",2002,2623,"['quot', '24', 'quot', '_not_', 'quot', 'soap', 'opera', 'quot', 'superficial', 'sense', 'story', 'more-or-less', 'week', 'week.The', 'closest', 'analog', 'can', 'think', 'saga', 'Monkey', 'King', 'being', 'translated', 'series', 'format', 'Asian', 'television', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'been', 'series', 'ever', 'before', 'envisioned', 'executed', 'tight', 'structure', 'story', 'line', 'quot', '24.', 'quot', 'made', 'mistake', 'renting', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'now', 'available', 'Blockbuster', 'DVD', 'had', 'seen', 'maybe', 'two', 'half', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'aired', 'then', 'gave', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'end', 'having', 'seen', 'lead-up', 'Watching', 'once', 'reading', 'novel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'down', 'realized', 'what', 'novel', 'cinematic', 'form.The', 'show', 'most', 'obviously', 'unique', 'minute-by-minute', 'gimmick', 'gimmick', 'deceptive', 'going', 'minute', 'minute', 'naturalistic', 'quot', 'slice', 'life', 'quot', 'approach', 'fact', 'direction', 'script', 'are', 'tightly', 'stylized', 'show', 'cutting', 'different', 'developments', 'not', '_really_', 'minute', 'minute', 'show', 'realistic', 'persuasive', 'very', 'highly', 'selective', 'what', 'how', 'always', 'achieving', 'maximum', 'effect', 'minimum', 'means.This', 'complete', 'visual', 'novel', 'not', 'condensed', 'translation', 'novel', 'mini-series', 'adaptation', 'complete', 'novel', 'individual', 'chapters', 'other', 'series', 'ever', 'done', 'Many', 'have', 'elements', 'continuity', 'etc.', 'characters', 'developing', 'time', 'various', 'sub-plots', 'developing', 'two-parters', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'self-contained', 'Not', 'here', 'goal', 'present', 'visual', 'novel', 'not', 'just', 'cover', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'minute-by-minute', 'suspense', 'quot', '24', 'quot', 'also', 'opposite', 'soap', 'operas', 'stories', 'never', 'reach', 'closure.I', 'also', 'appreciate', 'quot', '24', 'quot', 'never', 'thunking', 'head', 'effects', 'generating', 'cliche', 'altogether', 'always', 'viewer', 'will', 'quot', 'get', 'it.', 'quot', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'misstep', 'was', 'casting', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'bad', 'guy', 'accent.Somebody', 'going', 'figure', 'out', 'same', 'cinematic-novel', 'approach', 'will', 'work', 'other', 'kinds', 'stories', 'not', 'just', 'something', 'time', 'deadline', 'then', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'Right', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'realize', 'something', 'new', 'been', 'invented', 'here', 'A', 'cinematic', 'novel', 'done', 'scratch', 'Done', 'perfectly', 'first', 'time', 'gate']",24: Season 1

599509,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005JLF2,D. Mok,"[7, 8]","The Sopranos pushed the envelope, but 24 tossed it into the fire.  While The Sopranos has the edge in brains -- complex characterization, moral dilemmas and deep-reaching psychological explorations -- 24 walks all over it in terms of brawn, delivery visceral impact that's often dizzyingly powerful.The premise of real-time narrative is impressive, yet the writers, directors and producers of the show are smart enough to make every moment count.  The danger of showing a story in real time was that you could get bogged down in mundane details, but the writers have managed to whip up kaleidoscopic scripts that never let up even for a minute.  There's always something interesting going on -- and because of how tightly packed with action this show is, it probably contains enough plot and relationship developments for two seasons of a normal show.Make no mistake, though -- this show isn't just about a gimmick.  24 aims for the jugular, grounding itself firmly in great emotional connections that keep you interested in the hyperstylized approach of the show.  Kiefer Sutherland, as agent Jack Bauer, makes one of the biggest comebacks in recent memory, reminding us that when he's saddled with a good role, great writing and excellent direction, his brand of simmering, low-key intensity is just fantastic to watch.  Dennis Haysbert is amazing as morally upright presidential candidate David Palmer -- the conscience of the show.  Many other beautiful supporting performances abound -- Sarah Clarke as troubled, intelligent agent Nina Myers; a deliciously smarmy Xander Berkeley as Bauer's difficult and untrustworthy boss; newcomer Elisha Cuthbert as Bauer's daughter Kim, who undergoes a compelling life lesson in responsibility and self-awareness over the course of the season; Karina Arroyave as tech whiz Jamey Farrell.  And I just had to mention Kara Zediker, who plays Sen. Palmer's naive aide Elizabeth Nash.  It's a small part that only appears in two episodes, but her suspenseful, emotionally complicated 'dance' with Misha Collins as a Serbian assassin is simply mind-boggling to watch.24's production values are exceptional.  With feature-film-worthy cinematography, an extremely aggressive camera (most of which must be either handheld or steadicam), jarringly energetic editing, an amazing score, fine direction both of actors and camera, and sweeping geographical coverage, this is probably the first TV show I've seen that seems capable of truly surpassing the conceits of TV.  The action sequences are excellent, and the lighting is cinema-worthy.I have but a few gripes.  First, there seems to be a misogynistic leaning to the design of the characters -- a majority of the female characters are either scheming, lying, callous Lady Macbeths or victims designed to be killed off for emotional effect.  The portrayal of Sen. Palmer's family seems to employ several stereotypes about black people, as well.  And then, there are several plot twists that don't seem consistent with the rest of the show.  Of course, when you have as many plot twists as this story, it's a wonder how at least 90 per cent of them work, and work extremely well.  The final twist *is* a little forced, but at least it makes emotional sense, even if it may not make metaphysical sense.This show is still a tremendous achievement in television.  Indeed, it's heartening just to see the creators of this show take so many risks, even if some of them may not pay off. Just for its gutsy style, narrative conceits and white-knuckle tension, 24 deserves its own page in the annals of TV history.

This was a brilliant move.  It primes us for the premiere of Season 2.As for the show, I cannot think of another show that kept me wanting to come back week after week like this show.  The writing was some of the best on television.  I cannot even imagine who difficult it would be to write a show where every second counted.  Everything had to be in real time.

The Best  tv show ever produced !!. there is so much to say i don't even know where to begin!....Jack Bauer....what a man!!!...My introduction to 24 was a pretty good surprise and was also the ONLY thing i decided to do for the rest of the day after seing the 1st episode...yes!!!...it was that good!!!......lol!!!... I remember going at the video store on that day hoping to find something new i  haven't watched yet...The manager  knew what i was looking for of course... A HORROR MOVIE!!!...as usual...Being a huge fan of horror and fantasy to , he came to me right away and  said ""I'm sorry man,...nothing new this week..nothing you will like in terms of horror...unless you go and get yourself an old horror classic back there...OR....you could try this...."" and then he shows me the cover with kiefer sutherland's face and a big 24 written on it.I remember seing the cover and thinking...no.....i don't know....looks very ordinary to me..... I told him i wasn't  a very ""Action Movie"" kinda  guy as they all seem to be  the same to me.....plus those TV series are sometimes even longer and boring.....But then he said :"" No...i know...i know what you like and i know you have very good taste...but  trust me...give it a try...you won't be disappointed  i promise"".  I knew he was very good with the clients and was always able to make good recommendations. He also made me discover some true horror classics and educate me on stuff i didn't even know, he was a real movies/tv shows fan of all kinds and he knew his stuff!!!..... i  had to give this  a try.........And Im  glad i did!!!!!..i started with the 1st DVD which contains the 1st 4 episode.....oh man!!!...This show is even worst then any drugs i know, ONCE YOU START, YOU REALLY CANT STOP!!!!... After the first episode i was hooked right away!! I actually ran back to the store right after to get the others cause i knew exactly what i was going to do for the rest of the day !!!....lol....when i got there  the manager was looking at me with a huge smile and was like : so? Let me guess...you came back to get the other DVD's?  I said YES!!..IT WAS AWESOME!!! I WANT MORE!!!.And thats how my 24 trip started.... i was lucky cause when i finished the 1st season, the 2nd one was already available!! I jumped on it right away!!!! The 1st season is about a threat to assassinate president Palmer. Jack, who works at CTU (counter terrorist unit) is being ask to handle the case personally and discretely  as they suspect there could be a mole inside the CTU agency.I SWEAR!!!!,... by the end of this first episode, jack has to escape CTU as the place is being lockdown, his daughter disappears, a strange woman is blowing up a plane full of passengers  over the Mojave desert, president Palmer seems to have a lot more problems then we thought and you are standing on the edge of your couch drooling and dying to see what's next!!!!....you just know jack is in for a very long day....there is so much going on when you watch 24 then its almost impossible to not be entertain!!!This one would be my strongest recommendation if you don't know or cant find anything good on TV, buy it!!, go rent it!!!, whatever you do just make sure you can get your hands on it and i promise you...you will be in for a hell of a ride!!!! Dont hesitate to go and get the other seasons as well...i have them all!!! Up to season 8 which is unfortunately the last one!!!

However, there are some faults with both this DVD package and the overall storyline of the first season. This, however, will not keep you from enjoying what is essentially a 24 hour movie packaged as a weekly television show.Kiefer Sutherland stars as Jack Bauer, a federal agent for the Counter Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles. Around midnight, Jack is called into work where he meets up with fellow agents Nina Meyers (Sarah Clarke), and Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard), among others. Jack soon learns that one of his own people might be working against him in a plot to assassinate presidential hopeful David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert). As if Jack's troubles aren't enough, wife Terri (Leslie Hope) calls with news that dutiful daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) has snuck out with a friend and is missing. Jack's day only gets worse from here.24 is presented in a real-time format. Each episode represents one hour in Jack Bauer's struggle to protect Senator Palmer and his own family. Each hour is complete with surprising twists, and first-rate acting. You'll be stunned more than once.There are a few problems with the first season that lower the rating of this set. These problems are understandable however. Initially, it looked like the show might be cancelled in the middle of the first season's run, which forced the producers to conclude some story aspects early. Then the show was picked up for a full season, and they were forced to regroup and keep the story going for more episodes. This lead to some lame twists in the middle of season one, though I won't reveal them. Of course, if you've already read the Amazon review, at least one of them has been spoiled for you (note to Amazon, great job with that by the way!). However, said lame twist bothers me a lot less than the season's ending twist, which will leave you saying, &quot;huh?&quot; It doesn't make complete sense. Fortunately, you can come up with explanations that make the twist work. It just takes a little stretch of the imagination since the writers never bother explaining it themselves.24 is very much about stretching the imagination, however. For a series like this to work, you have to let some things slide. I mean, sure it takes Jack three to five minutes to drive to just about anywhere in L.A., but would we really want to see Jack stuck in traffic for five hours? I personally would not enjoy that.This particular episode compilation is also short on special features. And I mean immensely short! There is one alternate ending and I believe that might be it. So one star off for the far-fetched ending, and one star off for the subpar DVD set. The episodes themselves will mostly wow you. That's a promise.",3,"Immensely entertaining, but the story doesn't quite add up",1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,2771,"['Okay', 'let', 'begin', 'saying', 'love', 'series', ""'m"", 'confident', 'will', 'too', 'However', 'are', 'faults', 'DVD', 'package', 'overall', 'storyline', 'first', 'season', 'however', 'will', 'not', 'keep', 'enjoying', 'what', 'essentially', '24', 'hour', 'movie', 'packaged', 'weekly', 'television', 'show.Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'federal', 'agent', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Around', 'midnight', 'Jack', 'called', 'work', 'where', 'up', 'fellow', 'agents', 'Nina', 'Meyers', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'others', 'Jack', 'soon', 'one', 'own', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'working', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'presidential', 'hopeful', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Jack', 'troubles', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'wife', 'Terri', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'news', 'dutiful', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'snuck', 'out', 'friend', 'missing', 'Jack', 'day', 'only', 'worse', 'here.24', 'presented', 'real-time', 'format', 'episode', 'one', 'hour', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'struggle', 'protect', 'Senator', 'Palmer', 'own', 'family', 'hour', 'complete', 'surprising', 'twists', 'first-rate', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'be', 'stunned', 'more', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'first', 'season', 'lower', 'rating', 'set', 'problems', 'are', 'understandable', 'however', 'Initially', 'looked', 'show', 'might', 'be', 'cancelled', 'middle', 'first', 'season', 'run', 'forced', 'producers', 'conclude', 'story', 'aspects', 'early', 'Then', 'show', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'full', 'season', 'were', 'forced', 'regroup', 'keep', 'story', 'going', 'more', 'episodes', 'lead', 'lame', 'twists', 'middle', 'season', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'course', ""'ve"", 'already', 'read', 'Amazon', 'review', 'least', 'one', 'been', 'spoiled', 'note', 'Amazon', 'great', 'job', 'way', 'However', 'said', 'lame', 'twist', 'bothers', 'lot', 'less', 'season', 'ending', 'twist', 'will', 'leave', 'saying', 'quot', 'quot', ""n't"", 'make', 'complete', 'sense', 'Fortunately', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'explanations', 'make', 'twist', 'work', 'just', 'little', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'writers', 'never', 'bother', 'explaining', 'themselves.24', 'very', 'much', 'stretching', 'imagination', 'however', 'series', 'work', 'have', 'let', 'things', 'slide', 'mean', 'sure', 'Jack', 'three', 'five', 'minutes', 'drive', 'just', 'about', 'anywhere', 'L.A.', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Jack', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'five', 'hours', 'personally', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'that.This', 'particular', 'episode', 'compilation', 'also', 'short', 'special', 'features', 'mean', 'immensely', 'short', 'one', 'alternate', 'ending', 'believe', 'might', 'be', 'So', 'one', 'star', 'far-fetched', 'ending', 'one', 'star', 'subpar', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'will', 'mostly', 'wow', 'promise']",24: Season 1
599526,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B00005JLF2,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","Even in the heyday of the silent film serial, the format used by 24 was old. As for the 24 hour gimmick, well, it is not why people watch, and without knowing what is going on in television (and, never having seen this show on TV), I feel safe in predicting that few are going to follow up on it. Oh, but that suspense element, will Pauline be removed from being tied to the rails before the train comes, will Jack, Doc and Reggie, escape from the Temple of VADA KHAN (I Love a Mystery-Radio), will hundreds of heroes on horses,  in cars, in airplanes, on cliffs, in canyons, in tombs, in submarines, escape the dread monster with his Ray Gun. These were daily fare once we had movies and radio. Of course, there were many other uses for the serial format; but, it all comes down to, tune in tomorrow to see if Jack Armstrong will elude the evil,,,whatever.Having run on like this, in the face of 700 other reviews as I write, let me add to the chorus. While I would never watch a show which did not give me the whole story in less than a three or four episodes, nor would I watch such a show as this with commercials; but watching it with nothing but story, that made a hit. Naturally, one must accustom oneself to the fact that at the moment one of three or four ongoing story lines (which may be intertwined) seems to be solved, another immediately pops up. That's the nature of the genre: take it or leave it. The cast is fine,  production values first rate, music should be given special praise, and action scenes as they should be. I enjoyed the whole first season....but, frankly, I let more than a little time go by between movie length segments. I can take just so much in any limited period. Similarly, I have no inclination to take up Season 2.....to whatever; maybe, if I am still around a few years from now, I will be able to go back to this breathless pace of action.All-in-all the DVD is the way to go; that is, unless the direct download or streaming method works.

Anything else would be giving away plot devices and twists and turns that would diminish your enjoyment. (I will, though, mention one odd one that I don't see in other reviews: the use of cell phones to continue dialogue and keep characters ""in play"" while they move from one location to another.)What you DO need me to tell you is that the ""real time"" aspect is a stretch you shouldn't get too caught up in. Since I live in LA, and have travelled many of the routes covered in each of these seasons, I can pretty much guarantee that the travel times are often BS. I can also assure you that some of the cell calls (see above) wouldnt happen as they're depicted, because of lousy cell coverage in some of the locations. (Jack's phone may not be a conventional cell phone, but several other characters' are.)You also may need me to tell you that while Season One was blisteringly exciting and gripping, from the first scene to the last, the other seasons diminished radically in entertainment value. Season two involved several false starts that didn't add much except and episode or two of confusion. Season three includes some absurd side plots that went nowhere fast and then ""back to square one"" (an overused phrase anywhere, including in this series). I started watching Season Four but, frankly, gave up. The plot connections were growing thin, the character backgrounds had begun to be overplayed, the emphasis on Jack has hero didn't pan out as clearly as the network's obvious need to keep Keifer in the mix - and I wasn't going to risk wasting any more time on episodes that didn't add to the story line.So, get Season One. Definitely. Maybe even watch in straight through, in 24 hours (taking the 7-minutes-per-half-hour commercial reductions for bathroom breaks, snacks, naps, and/or reflection). Consider watching the second season - and skip the other two unless you're just insanely bored and can't find something better to do with your life - which, one might argue, would be sad. :)",5,"Fabulous and inventive, though overstated",1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,2284,"['do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'about', 'how', 'organized', 'etc', 'fact', ""'d"", 'do', 'better', 'avoid', 'other', 'reviews', 'product', 'description', 'know', 'only', 'sensationalist', 'political/terrorist', 'thriller', 'purportedly', 'real', 'time', 'Anything', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'devices', 'twists', 'would', 'diminish', 'enjoyment', 'will', 'though', 'mention', 'one', 'odd', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'use', 'cell', 'phones', 'continue', 'dialogue', 'keep', 'characters', 'play', 'move', 'one', 'location', 'What', 'DO', 'need', 'tell', 'real', 'time', 'aspect', 'stretch', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'live', 'LA', 'have', 'travelled', 'many', 'routes', 'covered', 'seasons', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', 'travel', 'times', 'are', 'often', 'BS', 'can', 'also', 'assure', 'cell', 'see', 'wouldnt', 'happen', ""'re"", 'depicted', 'lousy', 'cell', 'coverage', 'locations', 'Jack', 'phone', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'conventional', 'cell', 'phone', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'may', 'need', 'tell', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'blisteringly', 'exciting', 'gripping', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'other', 'seasons', 'diminished', 'radically', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Season', 'two', 'involved', 'several', 'false', 'starts', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'episode', 'two', 'confusion', 'Season', 'three', 'absurd', 'side', 'plots', 'went', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'then', 'back', 'square', 'one', 'overused', 'phrase', 'anywhere', 'including', 'series', 'started', 'watching', 'Season', 'Four', 'frankly', 'gave', 'up', 'plot', 'connections', 'were', 'growing', 'thin', 'character', 'backgrounds', 'had', 'begun', 'be', 'overplayed', 'emphasis', 'Jack', 'hero', 'did', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'as', 'clearly', 'network', 'obvious', 'need', 'keep', 'Keifer', 'mix', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'risk', 'wasting', 'more', 'time', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'story', 'line.So', 'get', 'Season', 'One', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'even', 'watch', 'straight', '24', 'hours', 'taking', '7-minutes-per-half-hour', 'commercial', 'reductions', 'bathroom', 'breaks', 'snacks', 'naps', 'and/or', 'reflection', 'Consider', 'watching', 'second', 'season', 'skip', 'other', 'two', ""'re"", 'just', 'insanely', 'bored', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'something', 'better', 'do', 'life', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'would', 'be', 'sad']",24: Season 1

599538,A228NBNLYJ8V3J,B00005JLF2,Eran Cohen,"[5, 7]","In the following I am going to count some of the benefits the viewers get out of watching the amazing ""24"":1. An insight into the formidable, violent - but also exciting - world of war against terror - ""24"" emerged right after the terror attacks that destroyed the Twin Towers and started to give the horrified, but also curious viewers, a glance at the gray and mysterious area most were vaguely aware of - in a never been seen before approach of 'documenting' events in real time (each episode illustrates the events of a single hour in the lives of the characters).2. Somebody to admire - There are two dominante roll models in the show:Jack Bauer, the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) operative, strikes the common viewers as the ultimate hero of all times. Nobody is really close to the level of the combative competence and shrewdness he demonstrates time and again - along side with dedication and commitment to his family and country.David Palmer, the California presidential candidate, also appears as one of the wisest, most devoted, sincere and patriotic characters ever to hit the small screen.Nevertheless, both are vulnerable.3. An escape form reality - Upon watching the series, the viewers are going to forget about everything that bothers them and concentrate on the events that keep on happening by the minute on the screen. The action is non-stop; no other series in the history of television had reached the level of intensity this series has reached. There is nothing else one can think of while watching it that it's almost therapeutic.4. A family get-together - Finally there's a TV series that can hook everybody - adult and minors - side by side in mutual respect. Yes, it is violent at times, but no more than the things everybody sees in movies and in the news everyday. It is also a great source for conversations and debates about the unconventional, controversial and shocking situations that are presented on the screen in an unprecedented density.5. Something to look forward to - When was the last time you really waited for a new episode in a TV program? Was it back on the days of ""Dallas""? Well, the drought is over; you are going to stay breathless during and after most of the episodes, anxious to see and know more. The best advice I can give is to take it one at a time.",5,"Amazing, innovative, breathtaking and magnetic.",1068854400,"11 15, 2003",2003,2306,"['following', 'am', 'going', 'count', 'benefits', 'viewers', 'get', 'watching', 'amazing', '24', ':1', 'insight', 'formidable', 'violent', 'also', 'exciting', 'world', 'war', 'terror', '24', 'emerged', 'right', 'terror', 'destroyed', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'started', 'give', 'horrified', 'also', 'curious', 'viewers', 'glance', 'gray', 'mysterious', 'area', 'most', 'were', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'approach', ""'documenting"", 'events', 'real', 'time', 'episode', 'events', 'single', 'hour', 'lives', 'characters', '.2', 'Somebody', 'admire', 'are', 'two', 'dominante', 'roll', 'models', 'show', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Counter', 'Terrorism', 'Unit', 'CTU', 'operative', 'common', 'viewers', 'ultimate', 'hero', 'times', 'Nobody', 'really', 'close', 'level', 'combative', 'competence', 'shrewdness', 'time', 'again', 'side', 'dedication', 'commitment', 'family', 'country.David', 'Palmer', 'California', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'also', 'one', 'wisest', 'most', 'devoted', 'sincere', 'patriotic', 'characters', 'ever', 'hit', 'small', 'screen.Nevertheless', 'are', 'vulnerable.3', 'escape', 'form', 'reality', 'watching', 'series', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'forget', 'everything', 'concentrate', 'events', 'keep', 'happening', 'minute', 'screen', 'action', 'non-stop', 'other', 'series', 'history', 'television', 'had', 'reached', 'level', 'intensity', 'series', 'reached', 'nothing', 'else', 'one', 'can', 'think', 'watching', 'almost', 'therapeutic.4', 'family', 'get-together', 'Finally', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'hook', 'everybody', 'adult', 'minors', 'side', 'side', 'mutual', 'respect', 'Yes', 'violent', 'times', 'more', 'things', 'everybody', 'movies', 'news', 'everyday', 'also', 'great', 'source', 'conversations', 'debates', 'unconventional', 'controversial', 'shocking', 'situations', 'are', 'presented', 'screen', 'unprecedented', 'density.5', 'Something', 'look', 'forward', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'really', 'waited', 'new', 'episode', 'TV', 'program', 'Was', 'back', 'days', 'Dallas', 'Well', 'drought', 'over', 'are', 'going', 'stay', 'breathless', 'most', 'episodes', 'anxious', 'see', 'know', 'more', 'best', 'advice', 'can', 'give', 'take', 'one', 'time']",24: Season 1
599539,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JLF2,Eric,"[8, 9]","As most people who watch television know, every show out there has a dud episode that simply exists as filler. But with 24, the case is different. Yes, there is a silly subplot introduced late in the season that's obviously there just to take up some time (let's just say it involves amnesia), but even at its weakest, 24 is still capable of providing more of an adrenaline rush than three summer blockbuster actioners combined. Yes, that's how thrilling this series is, and when you factor in the great characters, complex script, and Stephen Hopkins' surprisingly adept eye at mixing high-octane thrills and touching drama, then you've got yourself an innovative, masterful thriller that follows through on its real-time concept with verve and supreme confidence.For those unfamiliar with 24, the plot revolves around CTU agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). He's having a little trouble at home around midnight, when he finds that his estranged daughter, Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), has run off for the night. Before he and his wife, Teri (Leslie Hope), can serach for her, he's urgently called to work; it's believed that within the next 24 hours there will be an assassination attempt on Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), a black presidential candidate who stands a good chance of becoming the next leader of the free world.Plot-wise, that's all you need to know. The joy of the series comes from the unexpected plot twists and the crescendo in suspense as you wonder how Bauer is going to get himself out of this mess he's in. Yeah, there are some minor plot contrivances here and there, but they're hard to notice, and it's only after some extreme nitpicking you're going to notice a few flaws. The central storyline holds together amazingly well and never bogs down in confusion. The script also adds a lot of little nuances in the plot that'll put a smile on your face (watch what Sutherland does in episode 4 when he's desperate to interview a prisoner).In concept, 24 probably sounds easy and gimmicky, but in reality, the show must have been ridiculously hard to pull off. Little details such as traffic light can no longer be ignored. Action must immediately pick up from where it last left off and the filmmakers have to juggle several subplots together without forgetting the constraints in time. And somehow, they pull it off. Not for a moment does the series ever lose momentum or drag in pacing. Not for a second did I ever find myself less than completely engrossed by the converging subplots. And I most certainly never contemplated pressing the fast forward button (I watched 24 on DVD).24 delivers its share of action sequences. There are shootouts, chases, and cat-and-mouse games, which might sound requisite and perfunctory, but all the action here is tightly choreographed and work in service of the story. Thus, the tension is ratcheted up a few notches during some of the gunfights and chases. The final episode is probably the series' most thrilling segment; capping off with a two-fisted gun battle that actually resonates on a dramatic level and then a shootout between two passing cars, a ""money shot"" scene if I ever saw one.An aspect of assassination plots that's always bugged me is that the guy whose life is in danger is usually nothing more than a macguffin to drive the plot forward. 24, thankfully, doesn't fall into this trap. As played superbly by Dennis Haysbert, Palmer is a fully developed flesh-and-blood individual who's ultimately compelling and likeable. The turmoil developing in his campaign an inriguing dimension to his character that a lesser film or series would have ignored.Good as Haysbert is, it's Kiefer Sutherland who steals the show. After years of second-rate roles and glorified supporting performances, Sutherland finally gets back on track, showing why he's one of the most underrated actors around. Simply put, he delivers the best performance of his career, creating the perfect balance between tough action hero and everday family man. Leslie Hope is equally as good as his wife, Teri, carrying a Lion's share of the series' emotional baggage and pulling it off without a hitch. It's a pity she didn't get a nomination or two for her terrific work. The rest of the cast is quite good, though Elisha Cuthbert has gotten some criticism here and there. It's not a bad performance, but admittedly, she's least convincing when she shouts.24 ends on a surprisingly powerful note, a dramatic punch of a final scene that transcends this series from great entertainment to the realm of cinematic masterpiece (okay, no complaining, I realize this is still TV). Just ask yourself if any of the other networks would have had the guts to end it the way they did. Kudos to the series creators and Fox for delivering such a memorable conclusion. The main story arcs are resolved, but everyone has a price to pay. 24 is, without a doubt, the best show on television today and I absolutely cannot wait for season two.",5,"So good, I'm afraid I'll

What a day!I am glad I did not watch this when it originally aired or the week between episodes would have been painful to endure.

599543,A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,B00005JLF2,Ethan D Van Vorst,"[1, 1]","I'm undergoing a self-inflicted 24 marathon. I have the first 4 seasons on DVD and if things go as planned I'll have Seasons 5 and 6 on my DVD shelf by the end of the month. I did not pick up ""24"" when it originally aired in 2001, although I had very much wanted to. In fact I didn't get to regularly watching it until Season 5 and after a few episodes was hooked. The shows' premise, that of watching a plot to assassinate a black Presidential candidate on the day of the California primary is most definitely ambitious, and somehow the producers of the show managed to make it work spectacularly.To attempt an in-depth review of the whole of Season 1 of ""24"" would take up several pages of Amazon's review board, so I'll condense. Jack Bauer(Kiefer Sutherland) is in charge of the LA branch of a government anti-terrorist outfit called CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit). His unit receives word from an outside source that an unnamed group has hired assassins to make an attempt on the life of Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert, whom anyone who hasn't watched ""24"" will immediately recognize as the guy on the Allstate Insurance commercials) who is a leading candidate in the Democratic Presidental Primary to be held that day. Jack, along with the help of coworkers who may or may not be working against him, must race against time to reveal the plot against Palmer's life, as well as find and protect his wife and daughter, whom the assassins are using as bargaining chips to make Bauer do much of their dirty work for them.This is a very adrenaline packed program and the show is arranged so that each episode ends on the cusp of some cliffhanger type moment. That said, I think if the average person had a day anywhere near as convoluted as Jack or his family has they'd be ready for a lifetime supply of lithium and instant membership to their local mental health institute. The particulars of the plot change without warning and characters you thought were good turn out to be bad...and sometimes good again.There are some particular things I learned from watching this season of ""24"", some of which hold true for following seasons.-When Jack Bauer says ""I give you my word"" to anyone, that person is going to die a painful death, albeit probably not at Jack's hand-Jack is very proficient at making suspects talk-Kim Bauer, Jack's daughter, makes a great hostage. Easy on the eyes, probably smells nice, and manages to look good even when she hasn't showered in 24 hours. And she has a real knack for becoming a hostage multiple times just in a single season!-If you're nice to Kim Bauer and can make her laugh, even a little bit, she'll date you.-Ryan Chappelle, Director of CTU, is a perpetual dork.-Short term amnesia is a serious life-threatening issue for any good TV character. It would sure come in handy for days when I want to call in sick to work but can't. ""Sorry boss, I have amnesia. I can't remember how to do my job""-CTU field agents are like the red shirts from ""Star Trek"". There are an endless supply of them and they always die.-No matter how far away a target is the CTU Tactical Team on their helicopter has an ETA of 15 minutes. And they will always appear *after* Jack has already neutralized all the hostiles.-Dennis Hopper does a great impression of Christopher Walken doing an impression of Boris Badenov doing an impression of a Serbian accent.-Dennis Hopper is amazingly buoyant.-CTU has more moles than a fallow farm field-Shooting a tranq dart in your bosses' leg is always a great idea when you're looking to get ahead on an investigation. I'll remember this next time I'm bucking for promotion at my job.-Jack Bauer is like an updated Dirty Harry. Love him or hate him, he gets the job done and very efficiently.All kidding aside this is a real action-packed, adrenaline pumping series to watch and you'll find yourself unable to stop watching the next episode, even when you know it'll cost you a couple of hours of good sleep you need for work the next day. I heartily recommend ""24"" Season 1 as a great start to a fantastic continuing series!",5,Enter Jack Bauer...,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,4084,"[""'m"", 'undergoing', 'self-inflicted', '24', 'marathon', 'have', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'things', 'go', 'planned', ""'ll"", 'have', 'Seasons', '5', '6', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'end', 'month', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'up', '24', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', '2001', 'had', 'very', 'much', 'wanted', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'regularly', 'watching', 'Season', '5', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'hooked', 'shows', 'premise', 'watching', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'black', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'day', 'California', 'primary', 'most', 'definitely', 'ambitious', 'somehow', 'producers', 'show', 'managed', 'make', 'work', 'spectacularly.To', 'attempt', 'in-depth', 'review', 'whole', 'Season', '1', '24', 'would', 'take', 'up', 'several', 'pages', 'Amazon', 'review', 'board', ""'ll"", 'condense', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'charge', 'LA', 'branch', 'government', 'anti-terrorist', 'outfit', 'called', 'CTU', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'unit', 'word', 'outside', 'source', 'unnamed', 'group', 'hired', 'assassins', 'make', 'attempt', 'life', 'Senator', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'whom', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'watched', '24', 'will', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'guy', 'Allstate', 'Insurance', 'commercials', 'who', 'leading', 'candidate', 'Democratic', 'Presidental', 'Primary', 'be', 'held', 'day', 'Jack', 'help', 'coworkers', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'working', 'must', 'race', 'time', 'reveal', 'plot', 'Palmer', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'protect', 'wife', 'daughter', 'whom', 'assassins', 'are', 'using', 'bargaining', 'chips', 'make', 'Bauer', 'do', 'much', 'dirty', 'work', 'them.This', 'very', 'adrenaline', 'packed', 'program', 'show', 'arranged', 'so', 'episode', 'cusp', 'cliffhanger', 'type', 'moment', 'said', 'think', 'average', 'person', 'had', 'day', 'anywhere', 'near', 'as', 'convoluted', 'Jack', 'family', ""'d"", 'be', 'ready', 'lifetime', 'supply', 'lithium', 'instant', 'membership', 'local', 'mental', 'health', 'institute', 'particulars', 'plot', 'change', 'warning', 'characters', 'thought', 'were', 'good', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'sometimes', 'good', 'again.There', 'are', 'particular', 'things', 'learned', 'watching', 'season', '24', 'hold', 'true', 'following', 'seasons.-When', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'give', 'word', 'anyone', 'person', 'going', 'die', 'painful', 'death', 'albeit', 'probably', 'not', 'Jack', 'hand-Jack', 'very', 'proficient', 'making', 'suspects', 'talk-Kim', 'Bauer', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'great', 'hostage', 'Easy', 'eyes', 'probably', 'nice', 'look', 'good', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'showered', '24', 'hours', 'real', 'knack', 'becoming', 'hostage', 'multiple', 'times', 'just', 'single', 'season', '-If', ""'re"", 'nice', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'can', 'make', 'laugh', 'even', 'little', 'bit', ""'ll"", 'date', 'you.-Ryan', 'Chappelle', 'Director', 'CTU', 'perpetual', 'dork.-Short', 'term', 'amnesia', 'serious', 'life-threatening', 'issue', 'good', 'TV', 'character', 'would', 'sure', 'come', 'handy', 'days', 'when', 'want', 'call', 'sick', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Sorry', 'boss', 'have', 'amnesia', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'do', 'job', '-CTU', 'field', 'agents', 'are', 'red', 'shirts', 'Star', 'Trek', 'are', 'endless', 'supply', 'always', 'die.-No', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'away', 'target', 'CTU', 'Tactical', 'Team', 'helicopter', 'ETA', '15', 'minutes', 'will', 'always', 'appear', '*after*', 'Jack', 'already', 'neutralized', 'hostiles.-Dennis', 'Hopper', 'great', 'impression', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'doing', 'impression', 'Boris', 'Badenov', 'doing', 'impression', 'Serbian', 'accent.-Dennis', 'Hopper', 'amazingly', 'buoyant.-CTU', 'more', 'moles', 'fallow', 'farm', 'field-Shooting', 'tranq', 'dart', 'bosses', 'leg', 'always', 'great', 'idea', 'when', ""'re"", 'looking', 'get', 'ahead', 'investigation', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'next', 'time', ""'m"", 'bucking', 'promotion', 'job.-Jack', 'Bauer', 'updated', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Love', 'hate', 'job', 'done', 'very', 'efficiently.All', 'kidding', 'aside', 'real', 'action-packed', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'series', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'find', 'unable', 'stop', 'watching', 'next', 'episode', 'even', 'when', 'know', ""'ll"", 'cost', 'couple', 'hours', 'good', 'sleep', 'need', 'work', 'next', 'day', 'heartily', 'recommend', '24', 'Season', '1', 'great', 'start', 'fantastic', 'continuing', 'series']",24: Season 1

I got ""24"" on recommendation of a few friends, and the moment I sat down to watch it my world changed forever. This show is brilliant. Nothing short off.Needless to say, after reading some reviews on this site I find myself shocked. I've never been this upset about any other review on Amazon before. I can understand how it may not be for some people. I even understand how some people may have issues with certain characters (Bauer's no-nonsense ways or Palmer's righteousness). But I cannot FATHOM how anyone can call it unrealistic, unbelievable or, worse yet, tedious. TEDIOUS??? I haven't slept or eaten normally in the past few days because all I can think of is getting home and watching another episode. Just one more... Just one more... I can't tear myself away from it. No show has ever been able to do that to me.I am shocked that people find it unbelievable events like these can occur within 24 hours. All I can say to them is, you need to get out more! I've stayed up longer than that without sleep or food and barely a bathroom break, one of those times being in 1993 in a godforsaken Russian train station when a bomb threat was called in. You better believe things like that CAN happen, and they DO. Do you really believe that just because it's not on the 10 o'clock news, it isn't happening? You think you know EVERYTHING that's going on within your government? You don't think there's a Jack Bauer out there somewhere running around without sleep or food to save all our asses even though we have no clue he even EXISTS? Please, don't be naive.I'm shocked that people are attacking the ""liberal agenda"" of this show - which is absurd. Did you even know that FOX is run by one of the most conservative people in the country? What bleeping liberal agenda? Palmer being black? If there was really a guy like Palmer out there, and if he really did run for president, I would vote for him in a heartbeat!Everything in this show is top notch. Writing, directing, acting. The cast is stellar, and everyone - EVERYONE - is good match for Kiefer, he does not stand out at all but rather shines ALONG with a number of other stellar performances. A few annoyances (like the insistence that Jack's family always gets into trouble) do not spoil the rest of the show at all.Sorry, but anyone who says things like ""it insults my intelligence"" are giving themselves too much credit.

599545,A157YJT5WFLYJX,B00005JLF2,Franco J. Boccia-,"[0, 0]","Writing for a TV is a skill, and not one that many have.  Having to maintain pace, coherence and continuity within sharply limited six or seven-minute segments is a remarkably hard thing to do.  That the writers of 24 succeed, and have done so over several years, and more in a context that imposes even more limits  --the action in each episode takes place in real time of the hour, so that each TV tear ultimately is composed of twenty-four consecutive episodes, all making up one full day-- is even more noteworthy.And they DO maintain the dramatic interest at a fairly high level.  That's a notable acvhievement. In some ways, Season One remains the best of the series, although later years introduce some compelling characters.But as good as the writing is, it's still good only in the context of television, where the general level of dramatic (and comedic) writing is terrible. In part, that is because network writers are, as a group, limited in their knowledge of so many of the subjects they write about.  Worse, they all, or almost all, have a tendency to use the mindless cliches of TV land, when faced with the need to develop a situation.  A case in point: Law Enforcement personnel are trained NEVER to give up their weapons in a hostage confrontation, for obvious reasons  --drop your weapon and you have effectively become a hostage yourself-- but in 24 that happens all the time.  CTU is, on the face of it, the most incompetent organization ever: Over the course of several seasons, it has twice been attacked, each time with horrific casualties; there have been at least half-a-dozen moles acting within the unit, and on two occasions, lose a much-needed witness to a shooting, once by the widow of a slain CTU agent, who finds her husband's gun in his desk while cleaning it out, and once by a teenage girl, a victim of a sexual predator, who kills him with a gun in his apartment after he is captured by CTU and while he is preparing to lead them to the other perpetrators.  Both scenes are preposterous: No organization would leave a weapon, and a loaded one at that, among an employee's effects, and no competent law enforcement would fail to immediately search for weapons upon securing a crime scene.  In addition, CTU is always losing a witness or suspect they're holding or transporting to ambush, to thr point where you can almost bet with certainty that if a bad guy is captured a few episodes before the last, he will escape, somehow.But that's how the writers advance a story.  Does it take away from the overall effects of the drama?  It depends on who you are, I suppose.  Most people  --as evidenced by the show's popularity-- are undismayed by such things.  Even I can overlook them, or at least suspend my displeasure, and enjoy the narrative skill and the fairly good acting  --Kiefer Sutherland's performance, overall is excellent, and Mary Lynn Rajskub, who does not appear in Season One, is a treasure.Contrasting 24 with another popular and long-running series from roughly the same period, Lost, 24 is much better written, far more cohesive and, for the most part, more believable.  I would advise that, if you buy or rent the series, that you draw it out and not view too many episodes at once.  Things get rather breathless if you do.Dspite its flaws, 24, for a network TV drama, is a fine effort, and makes for an enjoyable evening.",4,24: A flawed jewel,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,3378,"['Writing', 'TV', 'skill', 'not', 'one', 'many', 'have', 'Having', 'maintain', 'pace', 'coherence', 'continuity', 'sharply', 'limited', 'six', 'seven-minute', 'segments', 'remarkably', 'hard', 'thing', 'do', 'writers', '24', 'succeed', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'several', 'years', 'more', 'context', 'even', 'more', 'limits', 'action', 'episode', 'place', 'real', 'time', 'hour', 'TV', 'tear', 'ultimately', 'composed', 'twenty-four', 'consecutive', 'episodes', 'making', 'up', 'one', 'full', 'day', 'even', 'more', 'noteworthy.And', 'DO', 'maintain', 'dramatic', 'interest', 'fairly', 'high', 'level', 'notable', 'acvhievement', 'ways', 'Season', 'One', 'best', 'series', 'later', 'years', 'introduce', 'compelling', 'characters.But', 'as', 'good', 'writing', 'still', 'good', 'only', 'context', 'television', 'where', 'general', 'level', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'writing', 'terrible', 'part', 'network', 'writers', 'are', 'group', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'so', 'many', 'subjects', 'write', 'Worse', 'almost', 'have', 'tendency', 'use', 'mindless', 'cliches', 'TV', 'land', 'when', 'faced', 'need', 'develop', 'situation', 'case', 'point', 'Law', 'Enforcement', 'personnel', 'are', 'trained', 'NEVER', 'give', 'up', 'weapons', 'hostage', 'confrontation', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'drop', 'weapon', 'have', 'effectively', 'become', 'hostage', '24', 'time', 'CTU', 'face', 'most', 'incompetent', 'organization', 'ever', 'course', 'several', 'seasons', 'twice', 'been', 'attacked', 'time', 'horrific', 'casualties', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'half-a-dozen', 'moles', 'acting', 'unit', 'two', 'occasions', 'lose', 'much-needed', 'witness', 'shooting', 'once', 'widow', 'slain', 'CTU', 'agent', 'who', 'husband', 'gun', 'desk', 'cleaning', 'once', 'teenage', 'girl', 'victim', 'sexual', 'predator', 'who', 'gun', 'apartment', 'captured', 'CTU', 'preparing', 'lead', 'other', 'perpetrators', 'scenes', 'are', 'preposterous', 'organization', 'would', 'leave', 'weapon', 'loaded', 'one', 'employee', 'effects', 'competent', 'law', 'enforcement', 'would', 'fail', 'immediately', 'search', 'weapons', 'securing', 'crime', 'scene', 'addition', 'CTU', 'always', 'losing', 'witness', 'suspect', ""'re"", 'holding', 'transporting', 'ambush', 'thr', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'almost', 'bet', 'certainty', 'bad', 'guy', 'captured', 'few', 'episodes', 'last', 'will', 'escape', 'somehow.But', 'how', 'writers', 'advance', 'story', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'effects', 'drama', 'who', 'are', 'suppose', 'Most', 'people', 'evidenced', 'show', 'popularity', 'are', 'undismayed', 'such', 'things', 'Even', 'can', 'overlook', 'least', 'suspend', 'displeasure', 'enjoy', 'narrative', 'skill', 'fairly', 'good', 'acting', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'performance', 'overall', 'excellent', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'who', 'not', 'appear', 'Season', 'One', 'treasure.Contrasting', '24', 'popular', 'long-running', 'series', 'roughly', 'same', 'period', 'Lost', '24', 'much', 'better', 'written', 'far', 'more', 'cohesive', 'most', 'part', 'more', 'believable', 'would', 'advise', 'buy', 'rent', 'series', 'draw', 'out', 'not', 'view', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'once', 'Things', 'get', 'rather', 'breathless', 'do.Dspite', 'flaws', '24', 'network', 'TV', 'drama', 'fine', 'effort', 'enjoyable', 'evening']",24: Season 1

In addition, there seems to be someone in the agency against him.This is the greatest tv show I have ever seen!  Every episode was gripping and left me with suspense until the next episode.  It is like reading a great mystery and each chapter provided more clues or twists to keep the reader in suspense until the end.  Now I am watching season two and am taping each episode so I don't miss anything.  I will end up getting that DVD set as well next year.  It literally makes you want to watch to see what happens.  Never has a show make me not want to miss a single episode.  It is exactly as how they described it:  INTENSE!!!!!With the DVD, you don't have to wait each week for what is going to happen because its all in there in one set.  And this show really felt like a 18 hour movie and the last episode ends the season terrifically!!

599554,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B00005JLF2,Gavin Wilson,"[2, 2]","Is this the best series of 24? Probably, if only because of the skill and effort needed to devise the plot and the characters for the first time. But this is a magnificent story with so many different plot lines going on simultaneously. There's even some fantastic tension among the senator's family who spend almost the entire 24 hours hanging around in a hotel.-- SPOILER WARNING: do not read on if you haven't already seen the series.You can get a 100% accurate idea of who survives this series simply by looking at the DVD box covers of the subsequent series. There are a large number of deaths in this story, and many of them are incredibly callous in their execution. The one at the very end is almost unbelievable, because the victim just wanders into the wrong place at the wrong time. I wonder if the producers were certain right at the very start of the production that this particular murder was going to happen.The construction of deceit throughout this series is fantastically well done. You have to watch the series through a second time, once you know who the CTU traitors are, to see how subtly their second-thoughts reactions are portrayed. For example: the only clue you get that the (first) dead girl's father isn't who he says he is comes when he and Terry Bauer arrive at the furniture shop and he fails to recognise his own daughter's car. Miss that -- and nearly everyone does, first time through -- and you get a nasty surprise a couple of hours later.On a more philosophical level, the thing I dislike about 24 is the implication that some lives are worth a lot more than others. An enormous number of people lose their lives in this story to protect the senator's family and Jack Bauer's family. I question whether it was really worth it.But Jack Bauer is America's James Bond (same initials, too), and you just have to accept a huge death toll with both.The only other thing I dislike about this series is that the split down the middle, when the second production team takes over at 14.00, is rather visible.  Jack has just rescued his family, they're sitting together exhausted in the helicopter, and it all feels rather the end of Jurassic Park.  It could have ended there.  The second story doesn't quite have the impact of the first half.Finally, in case anyone was wondering, the Andrea Newman who wrote and/or produced several of these episodes is not the same Andrea Newman who wrote UK TV's 'Bouquet of Barbed Wire' in the 1970s.",5,Almost perfection,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2465,"['best', 'series', '24', 'Probably', 'only', 'skill', 'effort', 'needed', 'devise', 'plot', 'characters', 'first', 'time', 'magnificent', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'plot', 'lines', 'going', 'simultaneously', 'even', 'fantastic', 'tension', 'senator', 'family', 'who', 'spend', 'almost', 'entire', '24', 'hours', 'hanging', 'around', 'hotel.', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'series.You', 'can', 'get', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'idea', 'who', 'series', 'simply', 'looking', 'DVD', 'box', 'covers', 'subsequent', 'series', 'are', 'large', 'number', 'deaths', 'story', 'many', 'are', 'incredibly', 'callous', 'execution', 'one', 'very', 'end', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'victim', 'just', 'wanders', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'wonder', 'producers', 'were', 'certain', 'right', 'very', 'start', 'production', 'particular', 'murder', 'was', 'going', 'happen.The', 'construction', 'deceit', 'series', 'fantastically', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'watch', 'series', 'second', 'time', 'once', 'know', 'who', 'CTU', 'traitors', 'are', 'see', 'how', 'subtly', 'second-thoughts', 'reactions', 'are', 'portrayed', 'example', 'only', 'clue', 'get', 'first', 'dead', 'girl', 'father', ""n't"", 'who', 'when', 'Terry', 'Bauer', 'arrive', 'furniture', 'shop', 'recognise', 'own', 'daughter', 'car', 'Miss', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'nasty', 'surprise', 'couple', 'hours', 'later.On', 'more', 'philosophical', 'level', 'thing', 'dislike', '24', 'implication', 'lives', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'others', 'enormous', 'number', 'people', 'lose', 'lives', 'story', 'protect', 'senator', 'family', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'family', 'question', 'was', 'really', 'worth', 'it.But', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'America', 'James', 'Bond', 'same', 'initials', 'too', 'just', 'have', 'accept', 'huge', 'death', 'toll', 'both.The', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'dislike', 'series', 'split', 'down', 'middle', 'when', 'second', 'production', 'team', '14.00', 'rather', 'visible', 'Jack', 'just', 'rescued', 'family', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'together', 'exhausted', 'helicopter', 'feels', 'rather', 'end', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'there', 'second', 'story', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'impact', 'first', 'half.Finally', 'case', 'anyone', 'was', 'wondering', 'Andrea', 'Newman', 'who', 'wrote', 'and/or', 'produced', 'several', 'episodes', 'not', 'same', 'Andrea', 'Newman', 'who', 'wrote', 'UK', 'TV', ""'Bouquet"", 'Barbed', 'Wire', '1970s']",24: Season 1

By 2am I was already irritated by Jack's wife and daughter, two insipid characters played by two of the worst female 'actresses' in TV history. Are they in some way related to the producers? I think we should be told.By 4am I was starting to be annoyed as to how stupid the whole premise was. Trying to summarise the convoluted, complex and idiotic scheme dreamed up by the terrorists to simply kill the senator is irritating me even more. Suffice to say, the whole thing depends on Jack Bauer's teenage daughter sneaking out of her room at night to meet up with a couple of stoned teenage youths in a van, who have been paid to kidnap her. What would have happened if she'd just decided to stay at home instead? The whole plot would have failed, and we'd be 23 hours and 55 minutes short of a series!By 7am I was shouting at the TV screen, to the goodies, the baddies, everybody. ""Why are you doing that, you idiot? Just do this!"" Characters behave in the most stupid and nonsensical manner, purely to set up a cliff-hanger ending for the next episode. Good grief - even the original Batman series was more plausible than this!By 11am I was exhausted by all the ludicrous plot twists and character changes. Goodies become baddies, baddies become goodies, and bit part support characters change from simpering lovebirds to rabid nutters,and back again, all in the space of a few hours.By 1pm I was fast-forwarding through the 'soapy' scenes, where embarrassingly bad actors spouted even worse banal dialogue to each other - the senator and his ridiculous son (who looks nothing like him and is about a third of his height), the senator and his wife, Jack's wife and Jack's daughter, Jack's wife and Jack ... ""I love you"" ""I love you too"" ""I was never there for you, but I'm here for you now..."" blah blah blah...By 3pm even the action scenes were getting dull. Oh look, here's Jack again, driving off at high speed in yet another vehicle... Oh crikey, he's crashed! Oh no, the baddies have got him... again! The man gets through about 50 forms of transport, all in one day - and never once gets held up in traffic!By 5pm I hate the goodie characters so much I'm rooting for the baddies. ""Go on... shoot them! For God's sake! Do us all a favour!"" Jack's wife is the worst of the lot, a strange scrawny individual who stumbles around weeping most of the time, showing all the emotional range of a Thunderbirds puppet - gawky, uncoordinated and with wide staring eyes too big for her head. This is fine when she's supposed to be suffering from memory loss and doesn't know who she is or where she is... but she's like this right from the word go! A more irritating character would be hard to find... although her teenage daughter - shoehorned into the mess purely to keep adolescent boys happy - comes very very close. She does a great line in stupid sullen petulance, and most of the time you're wishing somebody would give her a good slap.By 7pm I'm realising I'm just a few hours from the end, so I skipped through the last five episodes in barely one hour... and didn't miss a trick!It was a relief when it was over.

It comes in with a tacit whisper but ends solely on the face of combat. In its first season, the aboveboard objective never seemed out of focus. Terrorism in the hands of script-writers planning its every breaking maneuver to oust the Presidency of the United States. Rigid and thought provoking that lasted for a good twenty-four hour marathon.Kiefer Sutherland's protagonist, ""Jack Bauer"" brought the demeanor of John McClane to a whole new generation. The spirit that is somehow incisive and diverting will never fail with an audience. Sutherland's ability to take Bauer and sculpt him intothe ordinary man doing remarkable wonders exhibits strength rarely seen in televison or film.Outside of Sutherland's persona, this show was brilliantly cast and directed. Its substantial portrayal of its characters made it intensly realistic and firmly believable. Its fast paced directing style was unlike anything before or since. The blastering of gorilla camera angles pounded on the structure that captivated its audience under complete control.""24"" dvd box set of season one is an amazing joy ride of entertainment.

I had seen it when it first aired some years ago. ****spoiler alert***Overall it is a great show, one of the best seasons. For the most part the acting is good, the plot is entertaining and the twists are enough to keep you on your toes.Some of the problems with this show, especially in this season but it continues into later seasons is the coincidental nature of a lot of the twists and the unrealistic aspects especially the stupidity of this supposed sophisticated agency called CTU.I cannot really explain in sophisticated language what I mean so I'll dumb it down. Some of the things in this show are just plain stupid.For example, isn't it interesting how in places that are represented as being highly secure ie. CTU, the place where David Palmer is giving his speech, in later seasons the Whitehouse, that even with all that security including surveillance cameras and security agents, there is always one room that is completely without security? What an interesting coincidence that is.How about how all of the CTU agents are easily eliminated by a single enemy whenever they are supposed to guard somebody? The agents are supposedly well trained yet they make such careless decisions. For example, when the two guys were attacking the agents in the safe house, the last remaining agent had time to get Kim and Terri upstairs to a room and check doors for enemies but he did not have the common sense to call for back up? Makes absolutely no sense.Or how when investigating something, like when George Mason sent somebody to check on the Bauer house how it was a single agent. Does that make any sense, given how it was known that not only were Terri and Kim kidnapped, but their safe house was also attacked so wouldn't it be probable that the Bauer home would also be in danger? Why send only one agent? Again the coincidence that Terri just happened to be coming to the house at that exact moment the single agent was killed.Or how about how whenever a key suspect is in a position to be arrested and interrogated something happens to them, eg. renegade sniper who is supposed to be on your side, crazy b1tch who stabs the person (this happened in s1&s6;).What about how the ""highly secretive"" and ""highly secure"" secret prison operated by the Department of Defense only had 3 guards, 1 warden and then some maintenance men when they were expecting a highly dangerous prison or how the enemies were able to force entry into this facility so easily? What about how shoddy the wiring work was?I don't really want to bring race into this, but how come so many black characters are killed? The black agents in this are portrayed so poorly.Don't even get me started on how stupid Terri Bauer is, or how stupid Jack was for confiding so closely to Nina.There is one amazing twist though, you never see it coming!",4,Great but flawed,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,2855,"['recently', 'rewatched', 'season', 'had', 'seen', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'years', 'ago', '****spoiler', 'alert***Overall', 'great', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'good', 'plot', 'entertaining', 'twists', 'are', 'enough', 'keep', 'toes.Some', 'problems', 'show', 'especially', 'season', 'later', 'seasons', 'coincidental', 'nature', 'lot', 'twists', 'unrealistic', 'aspects', 'especially', 'stupidity', 'supposed', 'sophisticated', 'agency', 'called', 'CTU.I', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'explain', 'sophisticated', 'language', 'what', 'mean', 'so', ""'ll"", 'dumb', 'down', 'things', 'show', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid.For', 'example', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'how', 'places', 'are', 'represented', 'being', 'highly', 'secure', 'ie', 'CTU', 'place', 'where', 'David', 'Palmer', 'giving', 'speech', 'later', 'seasons', 'Whitehouse', 'even', 'security', 'including', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'security', 'agents', 'always', 'one', 'room', 'completely', 'security', 'What', 'interesting', 'coincidence', 'how', 'CTU', 'agents', 'are', 'easily', 'eliminated', 'single', 'enemy', 'whenever', 'are', 'supposed', 'guard', 'somebody', 'agents', 'are', 'supposedly', 'well', 'trained', 'yet', 'make', 'such', 'careless', 'decisions', 'example', 'when', 'two', 'guys', 'were', 'attacking', 'agents', 'safe', 'house', 'last', 'remaining', 'agent', 'had', 'time', 'get', 'Kim', 'Terri', 'upstairs', 'room', 'check', 'doors', 'enemies', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'common', 'sense', 'call', 'back', 'Makes', 'absolutely', 'sense.Or', 'how', 'when', 'investigating', 'something', 'when', 'George', 'Mason', 'sent', 'somebody', 'check', 'Bauer', 'house', 'how', 'was', 'single', 'agent', 'make', 'sense', 'given', 'how', 'was', 'known', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'Terri', 'Kim', 'kidnapped', 'safe', 'house', 'was', 'also', 'attacked', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'probable', 'Bauer', 'home', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'danger', 'Why', 'send', 'only', 'one', 'agent', 'Again', 'coincidence', 'Terri', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'coming', 'house', 'exact', 'moment', 'single', 'agent', 'was', 'killed.Or', 'how', 'how', 'whenever', 'key', 'suspect', 'position', 'be', 'arrested', 'interrogated', 'something', 'eg', 'renegade', 'sniper', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'side', 'crazy', 'b1tch', 'who', 'stabs', 'person', 'happened', 's1', 's6', '.What', 'how', 'highly', 'secretive', 'highly', 'secure', 'secret', 'prison', 'operated', 'Department', 'Defense', 'only', 'had', '3', 'guards', '1', 'warden', 'then', 'maintenance', 'men', 'when', 'were', 'expecting', 'highly', 'dangerous', 'prison', 'how', 'enemies', 'were', 'able', 'force', 'entry', 'facility', 'so', 'easily', 'What', 'how', 'shoddy', 'wiring', 'work', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'bring', 'race', 'how', 'come', 'so', 'many', 'black', 'characters', 'are', 'killed', 'black', 'agents', 'are', 'portrayed', 'so', 'poorly.Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'how', 'stupid', 'Terri', 'Bauer', 'how', 'stupid', 'Jack', 'was', 'confiding', 'so', 'closely', 'Nina.There', 'one', 'amazing', 'twist', 'never', 'see', 'coming']",24: Season 1

Too completely understand 24, you have to watch it from the first episode. Mostly becaase of it's real-time concept, each episode lasting an hour, each series a day, every episode connects to each other, and if you miss one, you miss a vital bit of information.However, after I bought the DVD set, I watched it in 3 days, (7 on Saturday, because school got in the way) I LOVED IT!!! I didn't think it would be good, but it wasn't. It was great!24 is about a man Jack Bauer, who must contiuosly save the day, while dealing with personal problems too. The first series is the day of the California Presidential Primary, when Jack has to protect Senator Palmer from an assation attempt. While also trying to find his daughter, Kim, who has been kidnapped. Others are his wife, Teri, and his co-workers, Tony Almeida, Nina Myers, and George Mason.Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer, and his fantastic in the role, Jack Bauer was definately his calling! After taking a break from acting for a couple of years, it was a great comeback. Kim is played by Elisha Cuthbert, who is wonderful at playing her, and getting into trouble. Palmer is played by Dennis haysbert, who is great as a political and family man, while trying to do the right thing for everyone. The other actors make the whole show come together, and they work off each other wonderfully.I would recommend this set to anyone, whatever age, whatever genre you usually prefer, this set will not disappoint you. I would only say, watch it from the beginning.Have fun watching 24!!Tick, tick, tick...Hannah",5,A Wonderful TV Show!,1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,1689,"['When', 'first', 'saw', '24', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'was', 'was', 'episode', '18', 'watching', 'was', 'bit', 'lost', 'Too', 'completely', 'understand', '24', 'have', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'Mostly', 'becaase', 'real-time', 'concept', 'episode', 'lasting', 'hour', 'series', 'day', 'episode', 'other', 'miss', 'one', 'miss', 'vital', 'bit', 'information.However', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'watched', '3', 'days', '7', 'Saturday', 'school', 'got', 'way', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'great', '24', 'man', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'who', 'must', 'contiuosly', 'save', 'day', 'dealing', 'personal', 'problems', 'too', 'first', 'series', 'day', 'California', 'Presidential', 'Primary', 'when', 'Jack', 'protect', 'Senator', 'Palmer', 'assation', 'attempt', 'also', 'trying', 'find', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'who', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'Others', 'are', 'wife', 'Teri', 'co-workers', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'Nina', 'Myers', 'George', 'Mason.Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'fantastic', 'role', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'was', 'definately', 'calling', 'taking', 'break', 'acting', 'couple', 'years', 'was', 'great', 'comeback', 'Kim', 'played', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'who', 'wonderful', 'playing', 'getting', 'trouble', 'Palmer', 'played', 'Dennis', 'haysbert', 'who', 'great', 'political', 'family', 'man', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'everyone', 'other', 'actors', 'make', 'whole', 'show', 'come', 'together', 'work', 'off', 'other', 'wonderfully.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'set', 'anyone', 'age', 'genre', 'usually', 'prefer', 'set', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'would', 'only', 'say', 'watch', 'beginning.Have', 'fun', 'watching', '24', 'Tick', 'tick', 'tick', 'Hannah']",24: Season 1

The only thing slow about it is waiting from when you click okay on the next eppisode until the eppisode starts! Which is like 30 seconds!This is definately must have for anyone!

599584,A34FSS6DNL1UJ,B00005JLF2,"""iriley1979""","[0, 4]","This show is revolutionary in its format and in the topics it covers. There has never been a show like this before and there will never be a show like this again. 24 is the tale of Jack Bower dealing with the most insane day of his entire life. It is also the tale of David Palmer, the first black with a &quot;real chance at the White House&quot;. Their destinies are intertwined; a past association will forever haunt their future. At first Jack seems like your typical good guy, but as the show progresses you see that he is no straight shooter. He is an accomplished liar and spy. Jack is no conventional hero. Everyone in this show has dirt in their past, secrets that they do not want uncovered. Nothing is quite what it seems. David Palmer looks to be a sure bet for the next president of the United States. His chances are sabotaged by a past cover-up. He is also a target for assassination. Bower is given the job of preventing that assassination, but personal family problems hinder him from doing his job. Jack is a complex, contradictory person. On one hand he is a killer and a spy. He has great instincts and nobody, I mean NOBODY, thinks faster on their feet then him. On the other hand he is a loving father, and like a typical parent has no idea what his kid is up to. So despite the fact that he is Mr. Cool on the job, he is just another fool when it comes to his daughter. His daughter is Kim, and she has inherited her father's guts and brains, as well as his disregard for authority. She is brave but foolish and naive. However, as the show progresses she matures into a young woman, she starts of the day a headstrong girl, but finishes it a seasoned woman. Jack's wife Terri is the opposite of Jack in many ways, but she balances Jack out with her lighter nature. However, in certain fundamental ways Terri and Kim do not really know Jack, they only now what Jack chooses to show them. Jack is a killer, he knows how to torture people, etc. He is a good guy, but he is no knight in shining armor. David Palmer also has his own family issues, his wife is a scheming power mad hag, one of his top political advisors is crooked, etc. Jack is hot on the trail of the assassins but fails to understand the personal nature of the grudge against Palmer, and his connection to it. In a sense there is no &quot;hero&quot; on this show although there are certainly a fair share of villains. However, most of the villains even have sympathetic moments, Mandy's grief for her partner, etc. I like the character Rick a lot, he is a realistic portrayal of a small time crook in over his head, he is no good guy but he is no killer either. Jack's associates at work are also shady, Nina Myers is his trusted assistant but she is also a great liar, George Mason is crooked in the sense that he stole drug money from a suspect, but he is a good guy in other respects. People are always lying to each on this show, deceiving each other, either because they have to, or because they think it is the best thing to do at the moment, etc. Now this show does glorify the CIA, it is most definitely an unrealistic representation of that organization. In real life the CIA is simply EVIL!!! But in this show it is only amoral or shady, doing whatever it has to for the greater good. That being said this is a TV show, so reality can take a back seat while watching it. But everyone should know that in the real world the CIA would probably be engineering the hit on Palmer, not stopping it. This series has more twists and turns than any other show in the history of TV, but surprisingly very few of them are groaners. Most of the surprises and plot twists are pretty good, and some are downright revelations. If I had to pick one hour that was my favorite it would have to be 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. WOW!!! That is the most intense hour of the whole series! The whole thing between Ira and Jack, man that was great, especially the ending for that hour, take about a twist!!! FOX deserves credit for being brave enough to put this show on the air after 9/11. I will never forget the first episode that came on about a month later. On the very first episode a plane full of people were killed by a terrorist with a bomb. Now Fox could have pulled that part or changed it but they did not, and it was the right thing to do. Art is supposed to reflect life and pretending 9/11 did not happen would have been pointless. But when the plane blew up on that first episode, oh man, did it hit close to home, it did not seem farfetched at all!!! Never has a show maintained such a high level of suspense for so long, this show is exhausting and very, very violent for regular TV. The ending is BRUTAL!!!! This show covers a lot of touchy topics, race, rape, dirty politics, dirty government agencies, conspiracies, moral ambiguity, etc. Really nothing is sacred on this show. The real time thing is strictly adhered to and the makers of the show managed to make the endings of each hour a cliffhanger. This a show that is not scared to be controversial. This show puts its audience through the ringer hour after hour after hour, until you cant take it any more but beg for more! 24 is shocking, scary, intense, crazy, upsetting, exciting, you get emotionally invested most in Jack's family, especially Kim. Buy 24, watch, then spend the next 24 hours trying to catch your breath!",5,"If you had 24 hours to live, this would be the show to watch",1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,5362,"['show', 'revolutionary',

599586,A19JYLHD94K94D,B00005JLF2,Itamar Katz,"[3, 3]","The 24 concept was a risky one. It was a show that, as likely as to become a hit, was likely to be an utter failure. It took great writing, fantastic directing and brilliant editing to make this strictly real-time show exciting enough to work; and though the concept began to fail in the following (still excellent) seasons, in the first one the real-time rule is very strict indeed. Each episode takes precisely one hour (including commercials); the event occurring in each episode take precisely an hour in the reality of the show. By keeping a steady rhythm of non-stop action and suspense, as well as truly surprising plot-twists, and top-notch editing which uses excellent and original technique (split screens, showing different events occurring in different places at the same time), 24 is one of the most suspenseful, exciting programs seen on television.Risky, I say, not only because of the real-time concept, but also because it is absolutely essential to watch every episode of the season to truly appreciate it. It's very difficult to make the viewers interested enough to watch every single episode. That is why most series give more weight to each episode as a whole, rather than an entire season; in 24, the whole is much, much more than the sum of its parts. Each season of 24 functions as a complete work, more like a 24 hour movie than a TV series. In that aspect, it may be the most impressive product of American television since the first season of Twin Peaks (the one directed by David Lynch). That is why, like Twin Peaks, 24's first season is well worth owning on DVD. I actually know many people who, seeing only some of the episodes while it was aired on TV, were not too interested, but became hooked when they saw it from the beginning on DVD. 24 truly is a series that rewards the loyal viewer like few others.The leading man here is, of course, Kiefer Sutherland. Kiefer made a transition that is quite the opposite of the norm: he went from a career as a second-rate film actor, to a first class TV superstar. Although the character of Jack Bauer becomes much more complex in the second and third seasons, one of television's most fascinating anti-heroes, Kiefer manages to impress in this season as well. He is overshadowed, though, by some fantastic supporting actors - Sarah Clarke as Jack's partner, Nina; Carlos Bernard as co-worker Tony Almeida, who balances out Jack and becomes one of the most important characters in the following seasons; the impressive Dennis Haysbert as the dead-serious idealist Senator David Palmer; Penny Johnson as his snaky wife, Sherry; Misha Collins, Zeljko Ivanek, Michael Massee and Richard Burgi as the wonderful villains; and a surprising first-rate superstar as the lead villain, whose identity it would be a shame to reveal to someone who is yet to watch the series. And last but most certainly not least, Xander Berkeley as George Mason, the egocentric, the sarcastic, the corrupted, but ultimately the most real and human character on this show. Berkeley becomes especially impressive in the second season, but in this one he does have his moments.It's hard to write about 24 without spoilers; so I'll kindly stop writing. The bottom line is, this DVD is very much worth the watch, and is a fantastic gift for anyone. I'm yet to meet someone who watched the first episode of the series and didn't become instantly hooked.",5,A television masterpiece,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,3397,"['24', 'concept', 'was', 'risky', 'one', 'was', 'show', 'as', 'likely', 'become', 'hit', 'was', 'likely', 'be', 'utter', 'failure', 'took', 'great', 'writing', 'fantastic', 'directing', 'brilliant', 'editing', 'make', 'strictly', 'real-time', 'show', 'exciting', 'enough', 'work', 'concept', 'began', 'fail', 'following', 'still', 'excellent', 'seasons', 'first', 'one', 'real-time', 'rule', 'very', 'strict', 'indeed', 'episode', 'precisely', 'one', 'hour', 'including', 'commercials', 'event', 'occurring', 'episode', 'take', 'precisely', 'hour', 'reality', 'show', 'keeping', 'steady', 'rhythm', 'non-stop', 'action', 'suspense', 'as', 'well', 'truly', 'surprising', 'plot-twists', 'top-notch', 'editing', 'excellent', 'original', 'technique', 'split', 'screens', 'showing', 'different', 'events', 'occurring', 'different', 'places', 'same', 'time', '24', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', 'programs', 'seen', 'television.Risky', 'say', 'not', 'only', 'real-time', 'concept', 'also', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'watch', 'episode', 'season', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'viewers', 'interested', 'enough', 'watch', 'single', 'episode', 'why', 'most', 'series', 'give', 'more', 'weight', 'episode', 'whole', 'rather', 'entire', 'season', '24', 'whole', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'sum', 'parts', 'season', '24', 'functions', 'complete', 'work', 'more', '24', 'hour', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'aspect', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'impressive', 'product', 'American', 'television', 'first', 'season', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'one', 'directed', 'David', 'Lynch', 'why', 'Twin', 'Peaks', '24', 'first', 'season', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'DVD', 'actually', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'seeing', 'only', 'episodes', 'was', 'aired', 'TV', 'were', 'not', 'too', 'interested', 'became', 'hooked', 'when', 'saw', 'beginning', 'DVD', '24', 'truly', 'series', 'loyal', 'viewer', 'few', 'others.The', 'leading', 'man', 'here', 'course', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Kiefer', 'made', 'transition', 'quite', 'opposite', 'norm', 'went', 'career', 'second-rate', 'film', 'actor', 'first', 'class', 'TV', 'superstar', 'character', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'one', 'television', 'most', 'fascinating', 'anti-heroes', 'Kiefer', 'impress', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'overshadowed', 'fantastic', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'Jack', 'partner', 'Nina', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'co-worker', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'who', 'out', 'Jack', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'following', 'seasons', 'impressive', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'dead-serious', 'idealist', 'Senator', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Penny', 'Johnson', 'snaky', 'wife', 'Sherry', 'Misha', 'Collins', 'Zeljko', 'Ivanek', 'Michael', 'Massee', 'Richard', 'Burgi', 'wonderful', 'villains', 'surprising', 'first-rate', 'superstar', 'lead', 'villain', 'identity', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'reveal', 'someone', 'who', 'yet', 'watch', 'series', 'last', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'George', 'Mason', 'egocentric', 'sarcastic', 'corrupted', 'ultimately', 'most', 'real', 'human', 'character', 'show', 'Berkeley', 'especially', 'impressive', 'second', 'season', 'one', 'have', 'moments.It', 'hard', 'write', '24', 'spoilers', 'so', ""'ll"", 'kindly', 'stop', 'writing', 'bottom', 'line', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', 'watch', 'fantastic', 'gift', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'yet', 'meet', 'someone', 'who', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'instantly', 'hooked']",24: Season 1

599588,A1AIRJRJQCNU5L,B00005JLF2,"jackbauerfan ""jack""","[2, 3]","24 is by far my favorite television show of all time.  This is probably my favorite season.  That could be because it was the first one I saw, or it could be because it is actually the best.  I don't know.Let's start with the characters.  Jack Bauer is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time.  I just love his courage, loyalty, and self-sacrifice (which we don't really see in this season).  In just about every season of the show, Jack gets messed over at the end.  But that never stops him.  In the next season, he's back and ready to serve his country again.  He goes into these situations knowing he could get hurt, but he cares about his country more than he cares about himself.  Let's get into some of the other characters.  I love David Palmer.  He is a senator running for President.  There is a terrorist group trying to kill him.  Why?  He's a black man running for president.  But is that really why they want him dead?  Another character I love is Tony Almeida.  I didn't care for him too much in this season, but as time goes on, he gets better.  Nine Myers was another character I initially liked.  She's fiercely loyal to Jack and does whatever he needs her to do with no questions asked, even if she knows she could get into trouble or lose her job.  There's an interesting twist to how her character turns out in this season.  I don't want to give anything away in case some of you guys haven't seen this yet, but man, that thing with her at the end of this season, wow.  Probably the most surprising twist of the entire series.  I actually liked Kim in this season.  I know I could get my account profile deleted for saying that, but I didn't really have a problem with her.  Many people hate her character, and I can see why, but for some reason she didn't really bother me.  The only character in this season who I disliked, and was supposed to like was Teri.  Some people liked her, but I couldn't stand her.  They try to make her the strong mother who will do anything to protect her child, but to me she just came across as a nave woman who stupidly gets into danger that anyone with half a brain could avoid.  I couldn't stand David Palmer's wife Sherry, and I wasn't supposed to like her.  She is an overbearing, power-hungry, manipulative woman who is obsessed with getting her husband into the white house at any cost.  I loved to hate her.As far as the plot goes, it was probably the simplest of all the seasons in the series.  The bad guys want to kill Jack and Palmer.  Whereas the other seasons usually had the bad guys doing some complicated act of terrorism, this season just has this one plot line.  Jack has to protect himself, his family, and David Palmer by finding out who is after them and why.  The villains in this season were amazing.  Ira Gaines, the villain for the first half of the season, is one of my top three villains of the whole series.  His performance, incredible.  Victor Drazen, played by Dennis Hopper and serving as the villain for the second half of the season, was not quite as good.  It wasn't because of his acting or the way he was written.  It was simply because the guy could not do a Slavic accent.  That kind of ruined all the good lines he had, and made him seem less threatening.  But he was still okay, in my opinion.  His obsession with killing Jack made him kind of scary despite his horrible accent.To recap, this is my favorite season of my all-time favorite show.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, and it was so intense that I just could not stop watching it.  I watched this entire season in two days.  It was that good.

He's briefed on an assassination threat to a major Presidential Candidate: Senator David Palmer. Agent Bauer soon learns that there may be an element inside his agency who are supporting the hit. Not knowing who to trust, Jack carries out his assignment to the best of his ability. Except the thought of his wife searching for their missing teenage daughter is a major distraction. Over the next twenty four hours, Bauer will discover how connected these two incidents in his life really are. And the clock is ticking....Kiefer Sutherland assumes the role of Special Agent Jack Bauer, and gives an amazing, Emmy Award-winning performance. Sutherland brings such different sides to one's humanity in the character and this pulls the viewer into seeing what happens next. This season has outstanding filming techniques and great editing. These aspects to the show received Emmy Nomminations, and rightfully so. The show's score is written by Sean Callery, and his take on music is perfection. He also won an Emmy for his musical contribution. The writers have a simple but very interesting story to tell, and it holds pretty well for a twenty four episode season. The most intriguing part to the entire show, is that it is in Real-Time Format. This however does cause a few problems in sub-storylines. The character of Teri Bauer is soon a drag on the main story, and it is clear that the writers did not know what to do with her midseason. They do redeem the show in last eight hours with a major twist to the main story. 24 SEASON ONE, is so well put together that it does not really feel like a television show. All the episodes are so connected in succession, that the season feels more like an eighteem hour movie, than a twenty four episode season. 24 SEASON ONE is a must see thrill ride!",5,DAY 1: The California Presidential Primary,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,1938,"['day', 'California', 'Presidential', 'Primary', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'called', 'office', 'Las', 'Angelos', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'briefed', 'assassination', 'threat', 'major', 'Presidential', 'Candidate', 'Senator', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Agent', 'Bauer', 'soon', 'may', 'be', 'element', 'agency', 'who', 'are', 'supporting', 'hit', 'Not', 'knowing', 'who', 'trust', 'Jack', 'out', 'assignment', 'best', 'ability', 'thought', 'wife', 'searching', 'missing', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'major', 'distraction', 'next', 'twenty', 'four', 'hours', 'Bauer', 'will', 'discover', 'how', 'connected', 'two', 'incidents', 'life', 'really', 'are', 'clock', 'ticking', '.Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'role', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'amazing', 'Emmy', 'Award-winning', 'performance', 'Sutherland', 'such', 'different', 'sides', 'one', 'humanity', 'character', 'viewer', 'seeing', 'what', 'next', 'season', 'outstanding', 'filming', 'techniques', 'great', 'editing', 'aspects', 'show', 'received', 'Emmy', 'Nomminations', 'rightfully', 'so', 'show', 'score', 'written', 'Sean', 'Callery', 'take', 'music', 'perfection', 'also', 'won', 'Emmy', 'musical', 'contribution', 'writers', 'have', 'simple', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'tell', 'pretty', 'well', 'twenty', 'four', 'episode', 'season', 'most', 'intriguing', 'part', 'entire', 'show', 'Real-Time', 'Format', 'however', 'cause', 'few', 'problems', 'sub-storylines', 'character', 'Teri', 'Bauer', 'soon', 'drag', 'main', 'story', 'clear', 'writers', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'midseason', 'do', 'redeem', 'show', 'last', 'eight', 'hours', 'major', 'twist', 'main', 'story', '24', 'SEASON', 'ONE', 'so', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'not', 'really', 'feel', 'television', 'show', 'episodes', 'are', 'so', 'connected', 'succession', 'season', 'more', 'eighteem', 'hour', 'movie', 'twenty', 'four', 'episode', 'season', '24', 'SEASON', 'ONE', 'must', 'see', 'thrill', 'ride']",24: Season 1
599591,A1YP6SXB3IU6WS,B00005JLF2,"Jack Mueller ""Jack""","[8, 9]","I'm here to set the record straight on past and future seasons of 24; no one here understands the life of Jack Bauer. In the fall of 2001, 24 aired with a pilot that had been receiving rave reviews from critics, months before it was shown on television. It had been a teaser of what was to come and what fans would later expect from the amazing drama. The show is the biggest thrill rides on television and is easily one of the next cult hits.SEASON ONE: On the day of the California Presidential Primary (Super Tuesday), the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) is informed of an assassination threat against Presidential Candidate; Senator David Palmer, there are agents who are supporting the hit. Minutes after discovering that his daughter is missing and his wife goes in search of her, Agent Jack Bauer is called into CTU to lead the investigation in order to save the senator's life. Little does Jack know, that in the next twenty-four hours; his wife and daughter will be taken hostage by the assassins and two of the most important people from his past and present will be involved.This season was backed up with a powerful all-star cast, amazing writers, and a perfect score. The story line had the right number of twists and blows the viewer away. There were a few falters within the show dealing with the daughter and mother who kept making dumb but reasonable mistakes. The pilot and the finale left the viewer asking for more. It's clear why the show was nominated for eleven golden globes. If it had been made into a film, with all of its violence, gore, and drug content, it would have been given a reasonable R rating.SEASON TWO: A retired and grieving Jack Bauer is called back into active duty by the President of the United States in order to aide CTU in stopping the detonation of a terrorist nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. Knowing what to expect, Jack asks for the guarded transportation of his daughter outside of the blast radius. Only the bombing of CTU throws everyone and everything into a twenty-four hour hell, revealing returning threats from everyone's past.In this season, not only does Kiefer Sutherland return as Jack Bauer, but he also assumes the role of executive producer. This seemed like a big mistake for this was the worst season of all, anyone who says otherwise is drunk or on drugs. There was no big stars, no twenty-four hour references, no drug dealings, and not even a new score to go along. And sadly, Elisha Cuthbert returns as the dumb and stupid Kim Bauer who keeps making the most dumbest and stupidest unneeded mistakes. This character should have been written out of the show and would be believable with the show's real-time format. The idea of a rouge nuclear bomb was a good one, but the show takes forever to get into important dealings of the bomb and is abandoned a little over halfway through the season. Smaller plots which should have been covered in the season premiere, is covered in the first five slow and mostly dull episodes of the season. The show should have started with episode six and ended with episode thirteen, and is beyond me why it was nominated for any golden globes. As a show, it was still one of the best out there, but sucked as part of the 24 series.SEASON THREE: After dropping off a contaminated body with a deadly virus, a drug dealer demands CTU's release of his brother from prison or will release the virus in Los Angeles that will result in death of the infected within twenty-four hours. Involvement includes returning rising threats from everyone's past.An all-star cast returns, along with heavy drug content, and an all new score to back up the amazing season. Once again Kim Bauer returns dumb as ever with a boyfriend who is a field agent only to complicate things. It was cool to make her a CTU employee, but once again, she makes unneeded mistakes and should have been written out of the show. The story line is perfect and returns with amazing twists and turns showing that the writers have redeemed themselves. The season is amazing and has redeemed itself and is worthy to be called 24, it still is not better than season one, but just as good.SEASON FOUR: All that can be said is; the show returns in January along with its real-time format.Kiefer Sutherland will return as the notorious Jack Bauer, other returning characters are unknown. With any luck Kim Bauer will be written out of the show forever. (That's probably asking too much though isn't it?) The writers don't understand that fans and viewers tune in for Jack Bauer, no one else matters. Nina and Sherry would have made perfect villains for future seasons, but one after another was too much. Besides, I keep waiting for a season to be about the assassin Mandy. Here's another idea pitch for the writers, a film dealing with the tragedies of Operation Nightfall. And for a future season, how about seeing Jack carry out mission that is suppose to last and hour but goes horribly wrong and lasts twenty-four hours? Bauer is the reason why twenty-four exists, and why it's done so well.Be it;- Tranquilize and blackmail a district director- Cut off a suspect's thumb- Beat up a fellow agent to avoid questioning-

I don't even try to watch a season long series on TV anymore.  But at Blockbusters one day, trying to find something that would interest me, but wouldn't be too girly-girl for my husband, I looked at the dvd &quot;24&quot; for the 30th time.  I was never much into Kiefer Sutherland and kind of reluctantly picked up the DVD to rent.  So it comes time to watch it and I AM GLUED TO THE TV!  The series had me spellbound, great story lines and tons of suspense.  I would even have dreams about the show, what is going on with that?I have been running to the store to rent this show every two days, and finally only have 2 more episodes to go. Had I known how good it would be, I think I would have bought it to begin with.  But now I am heartbroken that Season 2 is airing now and I have missed them.

Each episode runs back to back of each other so the 24 episodes is a one-day, 24-hour period of Jack Bauer's life.One thing that I like this concept is that by the end of the ""day"" (season), nearly everything is wrapped up.  There is no hanging on the edge of your seats waiting for the next season to come along.  Nearly everything (everything important, anyways) is resolved.  You can tell that the entire season is thought out from beginning to end so the fear that I have with Lost and The 4400 doesn't exist with this show (there is a chance those shows will be taken off the air and the mysterys will remain unsolved).This is also a fairly smart show.  It definately keeps you on your feet wondering what is going to happen next.  If you think you can predict how the season ends halfway through, you will be completely wrong.This show is also pretty intense and with a lot of action.  The last episode has you on the edge of your seat the entire hour (I think I would have benefited form the commercials so I could catch my breath).There are really only two shortcomings.  One is the real-time aspect of the show.  It amazes me how Jack Bauer can get anywhere in LA at anytime within 10 minutes without dealing with gridlock traffic.  Sometimes it seemed that things were done much more quickly than humanly possible.  Sometimes it seemed, especially between commercial breaks, that some things too continuous.The other shortcoming is the reality of the show.  Deeper into the season the show gets a little bit more unrealistic and Jack Bauer seems to pull of the impossible way too often.  But there weren't too many so I still think the show deserves five stars.So, like my friends, I highly recommend this show.  I've since watched the second season as well and found it just as enjoyable.  I can't wait to catch up and start following the show on TV.  I think this show will be fantastic when I am forced to wait a week or so between episodes.",5,Television Doesn't Get Much Better,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,2758,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', '4400', 'Lost', 'when', 'talking', 'others', 'kept', 'saying', 'like', 'shows', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', '24', 'finally', 'hit', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'picked', 'up.And', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'five', 'star', 'rating', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did.Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'director', 'CTU', 'Counter-Terrorism', 'Unit', 'division', 'CIA', 'mission', 'find', 'group', 'people', 'determined', 'assassinate', 'potential', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'However', 'word', 'also', 'gotten', 'Jack', 'leak', 'may', 'be', 'present', 'CTU', 'top', 'off', 'Jack', 'personal', 'life', ""n't"", 'going', 'well', 'daughter', 'ran', 'off', 'night', 'fun', 'friend.The', 'interesting', 'thing', 'show', 'episode', 'done', 'real', 'time', 'one', 'hour', 'episode', 'one', 'hour', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'life', 'episode', 'back', 'back', 'other', '24', 'episodes', 'one-day', '24-hour', 'period', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'life.One', 'thing', 'like', 'concept', 'end', 'day', 'season', 'nearly', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'hanging', 'edge', 'seats', 'waiting', 'next', 'season', 'come', 'along', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'everything', 'important', 'anyways', 'resolved', 'can', 'tell', 'entire', 'season', 'thought', 'out', 'beginning', 'end', 'so', 'fear', 'have', 'Lost', '4400', ""n't"", 'exist', 'show', 'chance', 'shows', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'off', 'air', 'mysterys', 'will', 'remain', 'unsolved', '.This', 'also', 'fairly', 'smart', 'show', 'definately', 'feet', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'think', 'can', 'predict', 'how', 'season', 'halfway', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'wrong.This', 'show', 'also', 'pretty', 'intense', 'lot', 'action', 'last', 'episode', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'hour', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'commercials', 'could', 'catch', 'breath', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'shortcomings', 'One', 'real-time', 'aspect', 'show', 'how', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'can', 'get', 'anywhere', 'LA', 'anytime', '10', 'minutes', 'dealing', 'gridlock', 'traffic', 'seemed', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'much', 'more', 'quickly', 'humanly', 'possible', 'seemed', 'especially', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'things', 'too', 'continuous.The', 'other', 'shortcoming', 'reality', 'show', 'Deeper', 'season', 'show', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'pull', 'impossible', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'so', 'still', 'think', 'show', 'five', 'stars.So', 'friends', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'second', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'found', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'catch', 'up', 'start', 'following', 'show', 'TV', 'think', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'fantastic', 'when', 'am', 'forced', 'wait', 'week', 'so', 'episodes']",24: Season 1

599604,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B00005JLF2,Jason A. Miller,"[3, 4]","I missed the entire first season of ""24"" and didn't become a regular viewer of the show until midway through Sesaon 2.  It took me a while to get used to the show.  While I enjoyed the ""real-time"" format, I questioned how, in such a large metropolitan area as Los Angeles, every location ever shown could be just ten minutes from CTU Headquarters -- including a bomb site in the Mojave Desert that took 45 minutes to reach by helicopter the previous week.I didn't get to watch Season 1 until shortly after the conclusion of the most recent season on TV.  Therefore, I came into the first year with a lot of mystery taken away: I knew Jack's wife, billed as a regular, was not someone in whom I should invest a whole lot of emotional attachment.  Additionally, of the four CTU regulars introduced in the show's first hour, I'd only heard of three... so obviously someone wasn't going to live long past sunrise.But even watching ""24"" in a way the producers did not intend in the autumn of 2001 -- knowing how certain cliffhangers would end; already familiar with the ""real-time"" format -- I still found the first season to be edge-of-your-seat viewing.  Even when I had the ability to watch the show over six weeks, not nine months, I still felt cliffhanger anxiety whenever the closing credits flashed on screen.  Some could say the show even abused the format, with the repeat drubbings it gave its female co-stars (Kim Bauer on every disc; her friend Janet on the first two discs; and her mother on the final four), but even those plot twists earn comedy value.  The amnesia in this season rivals the mountain lion and the baby, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.As in later seasons, the producers are able to overcome a soft parade of B-grade actors and their wooden line readings -- there is a lot of Deep Hurting in this set -- with several rewarding extended big-name guest appearances.  I was shocked to see Lou Diamond Phillips turn up late in the day, for example.  Dennis Hopper, who seems to have based his Serbian bad-guy accent on Mike Myers' Doctor Evil, more than atoned for the pain he put me through in ""Apocalypse Now"".  Also great to see Paul Schulze introducing his sometimes sinister suit from Division, a million miles from his equally rewarding recurring role on ""The Sopranos"".And could this show possibly work without Kiefer Sutherland?  It took me a while to realize just how much he means to the show -- hard to take seriously, at first, a man who is forced to shout ""Drop your weapons!"" every other episode.  However, he maintains such a high level of adrenaline week in and week out that he more than overcomes the occasional plot hole or weird left turn.  Dennis Haysbert does the same in Season 1, not yet the ineffectual Democrat president who got his news in later years from Fox News Channel.I do wish the producers had put more material onto this set, although I'm aware that subsequent seasons get the more deluxe treatment they deserve.  However, the twists, turns and surprise guest stars in Season 1 should carry the show through repeat viewings, which is the whole point of the DVD format in the first place.",4,Drop Your Weapons!,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,3157,"['missed', 'entire', 'first', 'season', '24', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'regular', 'viewer', 'show', 'midway', 'Sesaon', '2', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'real-time', 'format', 'questioned', 'how', 'large', 'metropolitan', 'area', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'location', 'ever', 'shown', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'ten', 'minutes', 'CTU', 'Headquarters', 'including', 'bomb', 'site', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'took', '45', 'minutes', 'reach', 'helicopter', 'previous', 'week.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'Season', '1', 'shortly', 'conclusion', 'most', 'recent', 'season', 'TV', 'came', 'first', 'year', 'lot', 'mystery', 'taken', 'away', 'knew', 'Jack', 'wife', 'billed', 'regular', 'was', 'not', 'someone', 'whom', 'should', 'invest', 'whole', 'lot', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'Additionally', 'four', 'CTU', 'regulars', 'introduced', 'show', 'first', 'hour', ""'d"", 'only', 'heard', 'three', 'so', 'obviously', 'someone', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'live', 'long', 'past', 'sunrise.But', 'even', 'watching', '24', 'way', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'autumn', '2001', 'knowing', 'how', 'certain', 'cliffhangers', 'would', 'end', 'already', 'familiar', 'real-time', 'format', 'still', 'found', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'viewing', 'Even', 'when', 'had', 'ability', 'watch', 'show', 'six', 'weeks', 'not', 'nine', 'months', 'still', 'felt', 'cliffhanger', 'anxiety', 'whenever', 'closing', 'credits', 'flashed', 'screen', 'could', 'say', 'show', 'even', 'abused', 'format', 'repeat', 'gave', 'female', 'co-stars', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'disc', 'friend', 'Janet', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'mother', 'final', 'four', 'even', 'plot', 'twists', 'earn', 'comedy', 'value', 'amnesia', 'season', 'mountain', 'lion', 'baby', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'think', 'do.As', 'later', 'seasons', 'producers', 'are', 'able', 'overcome', 'soft', 'parade', 'B-grade', 'actors', 'wooden', 'line', 'readings', 'lot', 'Deep', 'Hurting', 'set', 'several', 'rewarding', 'extended', 'big-name', 'guest', 'appearances', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'turn', 'up', 'late', 'day', 'example', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'who', 'have', 'based', 'Serbian', 'bad-guy', 'accent', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Doctor', 'Evil', 'more', 'atoned', 'pain', 'put', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Also', 'great', 'see', 'Paul', 'Schulze', 'introducing', 'sometimes', 'sinister', 'suit', 'Division', 'million', 'miles', 'equally', 'rewarding', 'recurring', 'role', 'Sopranos', '.And', 'could', 'show', 'possibly', 'work', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'took', 'while', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'show', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'first', 'man', 'who', 'forced', 'shout', 'Drop', 'weapons', 'other', 'episode', 'However', 'high', 'level', 'adrenaline', 'week', 'week', 'out', 'more', 'overcomes', 'occasional', 'plot', 'hole', 'weird', 'left', 'turn', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'same', 'Season', '1', 'not', 'yet', 'ineffectual', 'Democrat', 'president', 'who', 'got', 'news', 'later', 'years', 'Fox', 'News', 'Channel.I', 'do', 'wish', 'producers', 'had', 'put', 'more', 'material', 'set', ""'m"", 'aware', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'get', 'more', 'deluxe', 'treatment', 'deserve', 'However', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprise', 'guest', 'stars', 'Season', '1', 'should', 'carry', 'show', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'whole', 'point', 'DVD', 'format', 'first', 'place']",24: Season 1

I was fortunate enough to watch this series live from the very beginning, and it grips me soo.If you want a show that can cause a heart attack, this is that show.  It has me on the edge of my seat, and in all reality, has my heart racing! (no other show except prison break and dexter has ever done this to me).You cant stop watching the show, but most people looking at this review could care less what I think about the show, and want to know what I think about the special edition, so lets get started!The alternate ending.  is it new?  yes, is it good?  not even, quite possibly the worst thing I have ever watched (no, it is not badly acted, nor shot, in fact, it is technically sound, but the ending is not an ending, I do not wish to spoil anything, but to say it stunk would be a vast understatement!)Basically the whole set is the same as the original I'm sure you have on your shelf.  Disc 7 is new, and has your extended scenes, and 2 extra documentary's.The extra documentary's are nice, and worth watching, but not necessarily worth buying over your other version.The case is beautiful, it has a clock on it that says 24, you can press a button and it resets to 0 and counts up, which is cool.The housing of the dvds looks nice, with a fresh art design.

For those of you that have just started watching this year, you now can find out what happened between Nina and Jack.For those who don't know, ""24"" goes in real time.  That means each 24 episode represents one hour that shows events as they happen within that hour.  The plot revolves around an assassination attempt to kill a Presidential candidate.Kiefer Sutherland is simply outstanding as Jack Bauer, the CTU agent trying to stop the plot.  He is intense but, at the same time, very caring for the people around him.  Most of the rest of the cast is outstanding, including Dennis Hopper, whose role I can't give away without ruining the show.  The story is excellent and filled with twists throughout the show.The only drawback to the show (both this season and last) is Jack's daughter Kim.

599610,A28ERDII8FZQQ9,B00005JLF2,J. Daniel,"[23, 27]","Every television series has a dud episode every season. Whenever The X-Files focused on its central alien conspiracy plot, doldrums set in. Whenever The Simpsons made Abe Simpson the lead in an episode, there were more yawns than laughter (thankfully, this only happens maybe once a season). And majority of shows also have had their share of dull episodes that exist only as a filler for an entire season.But with 24, the case is different. Yes, a subplot that's introduced late in the season is there just for filler and it comes across as rather unlikely, but even at its weakest, 24 is still always thrilling and breakneck paced. Put it this way, this show offers every bit of the same adrenaline rush cinematic actioners such as Speed and Face/Off provided, but improves upon such films because of its great characters, complex script, and director Stephen Hopkins' surprisingly adept eye at mixing high-octane thrills and touching drama.In case you haven't heard much about 24, the plot revolves around CIA agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland, making a career resurgence) who, specifically, is one of the heads of CTU (counter terrorist unit). He's having a little trouble at home around midnight, when he finds that his somewhat estranged daughter, Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), has run off for the night. Before he and his wife, Teri (Leslie Hope), can search for her, he's urgently called to work, as it's believed within the next 24 hours there will be an assasination attempt on Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), a black presidential candidate who stands a good chance at becoming the next leader of the free world.Plot-wise that's all you really need to know. The joy of the series comes from the unexpected plot twists, the nail-biting situations and the ways Jack Bauer improvises upon these numerous dilemmas. Unlike most thrillers, 24 doesn't cop out; the clever script adds little nuances that'll put a smile on your face (when Bauer is desperate to interview a henchman alone, watch what he does). The central plot holds together amazingly well, and never bogs down in confusion. The final plot twist is a doozy, and while it might be a little puzzling at first, it makes sense after some careful thought.As stated before, the only time the script really stumbles is in that one subplot, but othewise, this is an unexpectedly well-written thriller that's both intelligent and thought-provoking. There's a lot of attention paid to characters (the villains aren't one-dimensional thugs) and detail, examining the interesting political structure behind a candidacy, as well as the people that make it happen.24 is directed like a movie, meaning we get very crisp, often brilliant editing and outstanding cameawork. On a technical level, it's hard to fault the show, all the more impressive when you realize the series is in real-time. Such seemingly minor details as traffic lights are not ignored, and these little additions add extra tension, building upon an already unbearably suspenseful storyline. The musical score also adds another layer of suspense, and unlike most TV series, doesn't rely on a repeating theme that gets tiresome and annoying.As a thriller, 24 delivers an abundance of exciting action sequences. There are shootouts, chases, and nail-biting games of cat-and-mouse that that are set-up magnficently and feature equally satisfying pay-offs. The final episode is perhaps 24's most thrilling segment, featuring an intense gunfight that actually resonates dramatically. There's also an awe-inspiring, heart-pounding game of chicken between two passing cars that possibly represents the series' most compelling confrontation (and believe me, that's saying a lot). These action scenes work not only because of how well-choreographed they are, but because you actually care about the situations and the outcomes.Unlike most films about assasination attempts, the candidate whose life is at stake is a superbly developed character. As played by Dennis Haysbert in a compelling performance, we actually care about what happens to this man because he's a likeable, flesh-and-blood individual and not just some macguffin that drives the plot forward. A dilemma within this character's own family and campaign adds an intriguing extra dimension that a lesser film or series would have ignored.But the actor who truly makes the series gel is Kiefer Sutherland. The man has always been an underrated actor, delivering solid performances on a consistent basis. But this his best work to date. As Jack Bauer, Sutherland is riveting, creating a character that works as both a family man and as a tough man of action. With a magnetic presence and dramatic range, this is a wonderful performance that was entirely deserving of the Golden Globe Sutherland received. Leslie Hope, as his wife, adds warmth to the series in a performance that's often touching, and always believable. It's nice to see she's no damsel in distress, either. The rest of the cast is quite good, I especially loved the adding of Dennis Hopper as a villian, but honestly? What's NEW? HE IS The VILLIN (""Speed"")The season ends on a surprisingly powerful note, as if though the creators made certain conclude the story with a bang and not a whimper. They certainly succeeded. The main story arcs are resolved, but each character has a price to pay. It's in the final scenes you realize 24 has transcended beyond the realm of great entertainment and into the pantheon of genuine masterpiece.

His wife and daughter are taken by people who want to use that to get him to do whatever they want. For starters they'd like him to kill David Palmer who is the first black man who has a good chance of becoming president.Every season has great twists and turns but I think this still just might be the most solid and well made season. I admit though that it can be annoying how much trouble the wife and daughter get themselves into. Fans have complained a lot about how much trouble the daughter Kim always got herself into in this season and season 2. But I think the wife was kind of worse. It's kinda a good thing she's only in one season because she wasn't really the best character. I mean it's kinda silly that she loses her memory for a short time because she thinks that Kim died. So she's pretty much the only bad thing about this season.Otherwise it's a great season with an awesome appearance by Dennis Hopper as the main villian. He was so good that I sorta wish he could come back some how lol. Plus you also have a very well done twist at the end with someone close to Jack actually turning out to be bad. So I highly doubt anyone saw that coming.

599621,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B00005JLF2,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[16, 18]","Being an action movie junkie, I thought I'd take a look at some of the newer TV programs out these days.  When I was younger, action TV shows, due to low budgets, generally featured everything BUT action (A-Team and Airwolf come to mind), but today's shows come off like big-budget films.  Content is also a lot more liberal than it once was, which is a great plus, as these programs no longer insult the viewer's intelligence.It came down to a decision between two shows, 24 or Alias.  I checked out both, and although Alias seemed to feature more of the things you'd expect from an action show (ie explosions, lots of gunfights), 24 was the better show.  In fact, when Alias premiered, its detractors dubbed it ""24 for teenagers.""  I hate to bash away, but I agree.  Alias is sort of like a WB show, it has all of the things I hate in TV action programs.  For one, romantic subplots take precedence over the action; there are inane comedic bits; puppy dog eyes between the lead female and male characters; quick build-ups and even quicker resolutions to the action scenes - so that the story may return to the aforementioned romantic subplots.Now, I don't mean to trample on Alias, and I hope those Alias fans out there reserve judgment of my review until they get to the end.  All I'm saying is, the decision between 24 or Alias comes down to what you look for in your action entertainment.  Alias is along the lines of shows like Smallville or Buffy, save for a bit more of a big budget look.  24, though, is more along the lines of the Sopranos or The Shield; there are no romantic subplots, puppy dog eyes, goofy humor.  There's no time for any of that.  Actually, I can make a better comparison.  If you like action movies like Charlie's Angels or XXX, then Alias is for you.  But if you're more into Die Hard or the first two Lethal Weapons, then 24 is the show for you.The comparison is apt, because I would rank Kiefer Sutherland's character Jack Bauer up there with the best of the action movie heroes.  Like Die Hard's John McClane, he's an everyman caught up in a crazy situation.  And like Lethal Weapon's Riggs, he's also a very dangerous man, who can get even more dangerous when pushed.  The Bauer character is an interesting spin on the action hero archetype.  Generally there are two types, the Everyman (such as McClane, or the Matrix's Neo), or the Superhero (such as James Bond, or most of Arnold Schwarzenegger's early characters).  Bauer is a mixture of the two.  He's a regular guy as far as his family life and fears are concerned, but when the going gets tough, you start to feel sorry for the bad guys.Most people probably know that 24 was originally greenlit by Fox for 12 episodes.  Halfway through the season, though, Fox greenlit an entire season's worth, which meant that the producers had to begin spinning new webs out of the threads they were in the process of closing.  This means that the first twelve (actually, thirteen) episodes come off like a first-class action movie, with building suspense and reversals that will surprise even the most jaded viewer.  Episode 14, however, begins a downward spiral (amnesia subplots, domestic disputes, etc) that the show struggles for a bit to get out of.  Luckily, things significantly pick up in the final episodes, particularly with episode 20, which is the first appearance of the main villain behind everything.  The final episode especially comes off like a great action film, with the tension and suspense stretched to the breaking point.The wishy-washy episodes don't take away from the first 13, not at all.  In fact, episodes 1-13 of Season One are some of the best TV I've seen.  You won't believe many of the things that happen, and the television boundaries that are pushed.  People are killed in violent shootouts, mutilated corpses discovered in abandoned cars, heroin used as a painkiller (!), reversals and betrayals galore.  The final episodes pack a wallop too, with a few surprise guest stars.Everything is great about the production.  The cinematography is great, movie quality for sure.  There are hardly any of those annoying, documentary-style zooms and pans you get in most other TV shows.  And unlike Alias and CSI, there is a healthy lack of dependence upon computer graphics.  Acting is great throughout; none of the campy hamming up you'll get in your average WB-type show.  (Okay, maybe one actor in particular hams it up; of course, I'm talking about Dennis Hopper, but what can you expect?  That's what he does best!)  A lot of money obviously went into the show, but instead of using the money to make soulless eye candy, the producers instead used it to create a quality program with great writing, great characters, and great actors.The DVD presentation is fine, but I would have liked more extra features.  There's only one deleted scene, from the final episode, and while the video/audio presentation is good, it isn't great.  Most reviewers mention this lack of extras, but most reviewers don't have the heart to tell you this: there are no chapter stops on this DVD!  I have no idea what the producers were thinking.  It's a minor complaint, but it would be nice to access scenes in each show.  At least this was rectified (as well as the extras department) in the Season 2 DVD set.In short, 24 is boundary-breaking television, up there with the Simpsons, Band of Brothers, and the Sopranos.  Whatever reservations you might have of Kiefer Sutherland in a role like this, get ready to have those reservations blown out of the water.  Sutherland is ON in every episode; he becomes his character in one of the most memorable performances I've seen.  24 is an action fan's dream: a high-quality movie that just keeps going and going.",5,The movie that keeps on going,1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,5748,"['Being', 'action', 'movie', 'junkie', 'thought', ""'d"", 'take', 'look', 'newer', 'TV', 'programs', 'days', 'When', 'was',

599623,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B00005JLF2,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[4, 7]","This is an innovative series. The entire 24 episodes chronicle just 24 hours in the life of one man. That man is Jack Bauer, a leader of the Counter Terrorism Unit. The 24 hours involved are the day of the California presidential primary. He learns of a plot to assassinate the front runner and is assigned to work the case. The plotters know their business. They kidnap his family to ease their way but they don't count on Bauer being who he is. They also don't count on the candidate being the man he is.It's an intense and emotional roller coaster packed with adrenalin rushes and lots of action. There are characters you loathe who turn out better than expected and others you trust who turn out to be dirtbags. Nothing is predictable except that waiting for the next season is tough.Episode synopses appear below:12:00AM-1:00AM - The episode starts with Counter Terrorism learning of a plot against a presidential candidate. There is reason to believe that elements within the unit are involved. Agent Jack Bauer is assigned to get to the bottom of it. His methods are ruthless and to the point. They are also effective. There is an hour to get the job done. The clock is ticking but Bauer has other things on his mind as well. His daughter has sneaked out of the house and is up to teenage foolishness of her own. His estranged wife is left to deal with the situation and that makes nobody happy. As the episode ends, the situation is even more tense all around. There is corruption within the agency, the candidate is worried about a skeleton from his own closet, a 747 has been blown up and the daughter has gotten in over her head.1:00 AM - 2:00 AM - The dirt in the Agency is worse than feared and the plot to kill the presidential candidate has escalated to a whole new level. That means more security but, because the senator has some skeletons in his own closet, he has ducked his security detail. The danger is growing. Its also growing for the wayward daughter who is in with a really bad crowd. She is in danger and so is her friend. The boys she is with have plans for using her somehow, we don't know how, but it will be bad...almost as bad as the turncoat agent.2:00 AM - 3:00 AM - The Creeps who took Bauer's daughter have a connection with the rogue elements in the Agency. The girls learn something about how brutal life can be. So does the senator. His opposition is playing dirty and is prepared to spread lies(?) about the senator's family. The senator's attempts at damage control make him even more vulnerable. That's not good because the bad guys are out for his blood. The bad guys include some bad gals as well and they are double crossers. Since the Agency has its own problems with loyalty, Jack doesn't know who he can trust. Actually, he does...nobody.3:00 AM - 4:00 AM - Jack's daughter has been recaptured by the urban scum who are in league with the assassins. Her friend has been left for dead but the scum are having second thoughts about making sure.  A couple of worried parents are heading in the same direction but they are stopped for a traffic violation. The distraught father makes the mistake of mouthing off to the officer and that results in their being delayed from finding the girl. Jack has a lead and gets out of headquarters just before it goes into lockdown. The guy running the lockdown is dirty but it is unclear whether he is dirty regarding the assassination plot. Jack's lead pans out but a cop is killed in the process and the suspect is clams up. Jack does learn one important thing. His daughter's disappearance and the assassination plot are linked.4:00 AM - 5:00 AM - The dirty agency supervisor is probably just a routine corrupt official and not a part of the assassination plot. This is good because he actually lets Bauer talk to the suspect. The suspect knows about the daughter and he is up to his eyeballs in the plot. Jack's daughter has been transferred to a professional bad guy. There is a contact set up. Bauer has to spring the suspect from the jail in order to make the contact. This hacks off the local police even more. It pays off with a bit of information but not enough to reach the goal. Meanwhile, the candidate has learned some devastating things about his son which may be true...even though they come from a reporter.5:00 AM - 6:00 AM - Jack finally meets up with his wife at the hospital. He figures that the other daughter may be the subject of an attempt to get rid of witnesses. The girl is in critical condition. Candidate Palmer turns out to be an honest, if misguided, politician. The dirt on his family is true and everyone knows about it except him. The wife is more interested in ambition than silly things like love, family and spouse. The kidnappers get serious with Jack's daughter. They get him away from the hospital and have him under surveillance. Worse, the father of the other girl is not who he seems to be and he now has mom off on a wild goose chase.6:00 AM - 7:00 AM - The threat of hiving his daughter killed has forced Jack back to HQ. The terrorists want him to replace the ID card they are cracking the code on with a fake. They are afraid he is getting too close. They also force him to get access to the big breakfast with the candidate. His assistant gets suspicious and the only way to get out is to kidnap her. Meanwhile, the wife still has her own problems. She manages to escape the kidnapper but she calls the Agency asking for help. The Agency send some more kidnappers. The place is riddled with them. This screws up everyone's escape attempts. The candidate wants to do the right thing and come clean. He is about the only honest person in this mess but his wife's ambitions may lead him astray.7:00 AM - 8:00 AM - The rat at CTU headquarters is finally identified. She was suckered into it with the promise that ""nobody will get hurt."" Now, the assassination is about to go down and she won't talk until she talks to a lawyer. That seems like a recipe for assassination and murder. The Secret Service has been apprised of the threat. Now they think that Bauer is the real enemy and are looking for him. Bauer is looking for a way out of a lose-lose situation. It gets uglier and uglier.8:00 AM - 9:00 AM - The assassination plot has been foiled and Jack Bauer is in custody but nobody is exactly sure what happened. Jack's family is still threatened and so, for that matter, is the candidate. Jack knows that the only way for his family to survive is for him to escape and he is driven to desperate measures to do so. The rat at HQ is still not talking and possesses needed information but takes drastic measures to keep that information from coming out. Meanwhile the wife and daughter have to take some drastic actions themselves to plan a possible escape. Again, the candidate seems to be the most honest person around but his ambitious wife stirs up even more trouble on that front as well.9:00 AM - 10:00 AM - The day isn't getting any better. Jack is still a fugitive and his family is still being held captive by the terrorists seeking to assassinate the senator running for president. He manages to elude the police but the mole in the agency dies before giving up any information. A new hard case is sent out to take over the Counter Terrorism Unit and cuts the feet out from under those still trying to help him. They do get their first real lead on the power setting up the hit. It looks like they find the money man and Jack is out for blood.10:00 AM - 11:00 AM - Jack has the money man. Now he has to sweat the information he needs out of him. The guys who planned and executed the kidnapping and assassination attempt have lost the trust of the ones who have hired them. The men behind the scenes have a contingency plan and say that both will be dead by the end of the day. It seems like the real bad guys made have a history with Jack from an operation in Serbia. Candidate Palmer has some connection as well. He has his own problems to deal with. His wife is making plans behind his back with his fired chief of staff. She is willing to take part in dirty deals to further her ambitions but her husband is not. When his suspect dies, Jack's only hope is to make it to a meeting with the money man's contact. That reunites Jack with the man who was posing as the father of his daughter's friend.11:00 AM - 12:00 PM - Jack's prisoner is forced to take him to where the wife and daughter are being held and Jack finally gets reunited with them. The hard case sent to take over the CTU is busy busting the chops of Jack's friends and trying to find out where he is. She is playing agents off against each other in the hope that one of them will break. This puts Jack's whole operation at risk since he is cut off without support. Jack is forced to call his replacement to ask for help. She doesn't trust him and she is suspicious so Jack starts the rescue with his wife, daughter and one of the teen scumbags who has had a change of heart (and hormones). The candidate is trying to protect the doctor who violated his confidences. He doesn't like the guy but suspects that those with political motives will try to kill him to shut him up. The day from hell is only half over.12:00 PM - 1:00 PM - The big escape attempt has bogged down. Jack's vehicle was destroyed and they have to make their way on foot. It's a game of cat and mouse as Bauer and his family try to avoid being captured by the assassination team while they wait for rescue to arrive. Meanwhile, Presidential candidate Palmer has his world torn down around him. Though he strives to be honest at every turn, he finds more and more corruption within his own staff and family. The puppet masters are trying to get enough leverage on him to force him to continue on with his candidacy. They want him in. The ones wanting his assassination want to prevent that just as much and a second assassin is on the way.1:00 PM - 2:00 PM - Jack is in custody and his family is seemingly safe but things are not as they appear. Someone is still out to get them even if it is just to make sure there are no loose threads...but there may be something more to it than that. CTU is aware that there are more threats against the candidate but the new team leader is more interested in her career than anything else. She thinks that torpedoing Bauer is a smart career move. The big threat from Serbia is methodically wiping out the first team that failed and is setting up for another attempt. The candidate has been pressured into continuing the campaign but his son is finally developing a conscience and wants to come clean. Connections are starting to be made with Yugoslavia and the candidate thinks this whole affair has been orchestrated by Bauer as vengeance for a failed operation in Serbia that he had something mysterious to do with. To make matters worse, there is a mole within the campaign organization.2:00 PM - 3:00 PM - Jack is still under a cloud and his family is being interrogated at a safe house when Senator Palmer shows up and demands to speak with him. After pulling some strings, he gets his way. He thinks Jack is part of the big plot. Very quickly though, they both come to the realization that the hit is not motivated by politics. It is revenge for an operation in Yugoslavia several years before. They come to believe that they and their families are all still in danger. They are right. There is one other person who can help, a former operative. He proves useful but he's on the hit list as well. They body count starts increasing and the Senator pulls some string to get Jack reinstated and running the investigation.3:00 PM - 4:00 PM - The CTU team finally begins to get a few breaks. They find the identity of at least a few of the assassination team. When they warn the senator and his staff is briefed, one of them comes forward as having had contact with one of the shooters. She is willing to cooperate. She will set up one of the shooters. She better hurry because another shooter is closing in on Jack's family. The safe house is not as safe as they had hoped and mom has to take things into her own hands again...with seemingly tragic results. Just to keep the tension ratcheted up, Jack has reason to suspect there is another mole in the CTU but there is no way to be sure. It going to be even harder to figure out since his security clearance has been downgraded. The senator's son has his own vendetta and sets off on his own tangent. This is going to further confuse everything.4:00 PM - 5:00 PM - The car crash has left Jack's wife and daughter separated and each believing the wrong thing about the other. The daughter thinks the mother has been kidnapped and the mother has amnesia and doesn't remember who she is. The daughter doesn't trust anyone except for the young punk that helped to kidnap her to begin with. This does not sit well with the punk's girlfriend.  CTU is using the candidate's staffer to try and plant a bug on one of the assassins. The nervous woman understandably has a difficult time maintaining the act. The woman scorned has more on her mind than just helping the cops. That thwarts all the plans for the setup. The daughter has problems with being ""the woman scorned"" as well. The only ray of hope is that Jack manages to set up a meeting with somebody involved in the plot but that's for next time.5:00 PM - 6:00PM - When one of the assassins becomes a casualty, most chances of rounding up the rest of the ring are thwarted until a phone call gets them an opportunity to meet with one of the others. This will involve Jack posing as the hurt assassin and hoping that the other won't recognize him. Unfortunately, one of his back up team has a score to settle with Jack personally. The brass are keeping the information about Jack's family away from him. The daughter is now being held by a minor league bad guy and the mother still has amnesia and doesn't remember who she is. The candidate's wife is still worried more about her own ambitions than about anything else including her husband, family, truth or justice. She gets caught by her husband's sting and he decides he cannot trust her.6:00 PM - 7:00 PM - The bad guy set up for a contact is dead but Jack does get some information to lead him to another point he thinks is critical. He just doesn't know why it's critical. He heads that way and is shepherded by his boss. He still thinks someone is dirty in the agency and the agency still hasn't told him that there has been an attempt on his wife and daughter and that they are missing. The wife is starting to come out of her amnesia and is taken to her house by an old flame. The bad guys are casing the place looking for another try. Meanwhile, the daughter has gotten herself into another bad situation when she looks up the thug who kidnapped her. Another thug then holds them both while he tries to conduct a drug deal and rip off his source. It is going to get even uglier for her. The senator finally makes his big speech and leaves everyone speechless and some crooks livid. I think I might even vote for this guy and hope his honesty is infectious. Jack makes his way to the next site but the bad guys realize he's there. He still doesn't know what, if anything, he has found.7:00 PM - 8:00 PM - Jack finally figures out that in addition to the revenge motive, there is a political motive to the assassination attempts as well. The coordinates he finds leads to a secret prisoner and Jack is taken into custody by the defense department which runs the place. Jack convinces the warden that an attempt will be made to do something at 7:20. He learns that a secret prisoner will be transferred at that time but that nobody knows who the prisoner is. When the prisoner arrives, it turns out to be somebody Jack saw die in Serbia several years ago. He is the patriarch of the Serbians who are trying to kill him, his family and the senator. He knows they are going to make another try. The daughter has been picked up by the police who think she is a run of the mill druggie and don't believe her wild stories. The mother is being taken to CTU. The senator learns that honesty really does pay off and that his wife is even more power mad than he believed possible.8:00 PM - 9:00 PM - The terrorists make an attempt on the secret prison and they manage to capture the place, proving along the way why one should not negotiate with terrorists; they don't keep up their end of the deal. Now, CTU must find a way to rescue them. Jack's wife is back at CTU being a nuisance because she is being given the mushroom treatment. The daughter is still rotting in jail but she manages to get some leverage by actually standing up for herself. The senator sweeps the primaries and his wife is not any more trustworthy than before but he has some new problems. One of his interns has the hots for him. At least he is standing strong and still acting as an honest a decent man. Meanwhile, back at the hellhole, the terrorists kill everyone but Jack and manage to escape. They are about to kill him as well but he has a bargaining chip. Then the daughter gets caught again.9:00 PM - 10:00 PM - The terrorists have Jack and they have his daughter. They want them both dead but they also want one of their own back. They try to arrange a trade but the political animals at the agency figure it's better to lose Jack than to face possible embarrassment. They write him off. This hacks off some of his team members who contact the senator through back channels to see if he can put some pressure on the agency to go through with a trade. His wife has schemes of her own. She wants the White House and has her own ambitions. Since their marriage is troubled, she looks for leverage. The old harridan tries to set him up with a staffer to gain some leverage but, so far, he is still squeaky clean.10:00 PM - 11:00 PM - The terrorists are nothing if not persistent. They have Jack's daughter again and are threatening to kill her unless Jack does a few things for them. They want him to get the senator to unlock their funds, and they want him to kill the senator. It looks like the senator is going to succumb to the setup his wife has prepared for him. He doesn't and he finds even less reason to trust his wife. He does trust Jack but Secret Service does not. Jack comes through though and saves the senator again. Keeping the terrorists in the dark though puts up a terrible obstacle: the candidate's wife. She fears that saving Jack's daughter will endanger her own political ambitions. They have more problems. There is still a mole inside the agency. It is one of the biggest surprises of the season.11:00 PM - 12:00 AM - The terrorists not longer have Jack's daughter but he does not know that. The mole sets Jack up for death by telling him that his daughter has been killed. That puts Jack into revenge mode and the terrorists are going to be toast. That still leaves the problem of the mole. The mole has its own hostage but does not manage to escape Jack's wrath. His hardest decision is the one not to kill it. The mole should have been killed because it killed the hostage. The candidate has his own problem as well. That is his wife. Being the honest man he is, he solves the problem and the day from hell is over.",5,An Intense and Inventive Emotional Roller Coaster,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,19286,"['innovative', 'series',

599624,A259ZCBXTVXUNU,B00005JLF2,John Anderson,"[0, 0]","I work in a large warehouse.  Towards the end of the first season of &#34;24&#34; I kept hearing a lot of the guys at work talking about it.  At the beginning of the fall ( I guess the fall of 2001 ) I saw that Amazon had season one for sale. Given I had never bought any TV series before I thought it might be nice to have something I could watch for less than an hour if I had just a bit of time before bed.  About a week after buying it I sat down and started to watch the very beginning, my wife came in and asked what I was watching.  I told her, she asked what it was about and who starred in it...I wasn't really sure what the plot was but gave her a rough idea.

And yes, there are holes and yes, an occasional plot line during the late afternoon hours passes over into the ridiculous, and yes, absolutely nobody could ever have a day like this. But so what?On the whole this show managed to take the standard 24 episode television season and turn it into one giant continuously running storyline.  This is a concept that is so prevalent now that it seems commonplace and it's easy to forget that this is where it all started.  There were some shows before it that certainly came close, a number of the classic HBO series for example, but even those would break for one-off episodes before continuing on with three or four episode arcs.I can remember the first time I watched Season One of 24 and how stunned I was when the sun rose in the world of these characters and how impressed I was that they were pulling off this concept so well.But, again, just making each episode an hour doesn't a great show make.In the end I found 24 to be enjoyable because it's enjoyable.  Great story, if not a bit over the top, interesting characters, even the annoying ones are fun because you get to talk about how annoying they are with the people you're watching with, and action that pulls you in.The last time I came across such unabashedly in-your-face non-stop action with such a deliberately interwoven storyline was when I readThe Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics).All Dumas was trying to do was tell a gripping yarn, and all 24 is trying to do is the same.In my opinion they both succeed.",5,Dumas for the 21st Century,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,1993,"['first', 'season', '24', 'anything', 'come', 'it.The', 'show', 'around', 'single', 'day', 'life', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'episode', 'covering', 'one', 'hour', 'job', 'anti-terrorism', 'task', 'force', 'family', 'one', 'gigantic', 'mess', 'Friday.And', 'yes', 'made', 'jokes', 'too', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'premise', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'gimmick', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'sustained', 'such', 'format', 'would', 'grow', 'very', 'old', 'very', 'fast', 'yes', 'are', 'holes', 'yes', 'occasional', 'plot', 'line', 'late', 'afternoon', 'hours', 'ridiculous', 'yes', 'absolutely', 'nobody', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'day', 'so', 'what', 'whole', 'show', 'managed', 'take', 'standard', '24', 'episode', 'television', 'season', 'turn', 'one', 'giant', 'continuously', 'running', 'storyline', 'concept', 'so', 'prevalent', 'now', 'commonplace', 'easy', 'forget', 'where', 'started', 'were', 'shows', 'certainly', 'came', 'close', 'number', 'classic', 'HBO', 'series', 'example', 'even', 'would', 'break', 'one-off', 'episodes', 'continuing', 'three', 'four', 'episode', 'arcs.I', 'can', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Season', 'One', '24', 'how', 'stunned', 'was', 'when', 'sun', 'rose', 'world', 'characters', 'how', 'impressed', 'was', 'were', 'pulling', 'off', 'concept', 'so', 'well.But', 'again', 'just', 'making', 'episode', 'hour', ""n't"", 'great', 'show', 'end', 'found', '24', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'enjoyable', 'Great', 'story', 'not', 'bit', 'top', 'interesting', 'characters', 'even', 'annoying', 'ones', 'are', 'fun', 'get', 'talk', 'how', 'annoying', 'are', 'people', ""'re"", 'watching', 'action', 'in.The', 'last', 'time', 'came', 'such', 'unabashedly', 'in-your-face', 'non-stop', 'action', 'deliberately', 'interwoven', 'storyline', 'was', 'when', 'readThe', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'Penguin', 'Classics', '.All', 'Dumas', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'was', 'tell', 'gripping', 'yarn', '24', 'trying', 'do', 'same.In', 'opinion', 'succeed']",24: Season 1

599648,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JLF2,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 1]","In 2001 the Fox network decided it would take the dramatic television series to the next level with the introduction of one of the most exciting, action packed series' to be created, ""24"".  ""24"" utilizes a unique format for telling it's stories, instead of having individual episodes tell an individual story that would probably have some small impact on the season's outcome, ""24"" chooses to tell one story that occurs in a single day, all season long and have each individual episode count for one hour out of that day.  Using what is now known as the real-time format, which means that each episode is exactly one hour of time that has passed in the day.  Most shows seasons span many days, months, maybe even a year, but ""24"" chose to be bold and stand out from the rest of the competition.  A move that could have been costly in regards to ratings and success, but proved to be the shows most endearing quality and virtually ensures it high ratings each week as people tune in to see what will happen next.The basic backbone of ""24"" is the lead character, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), a federal agent working at CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) for Los Angeles.  Bauer, along with his fellow CTU agents are responsible for stopping threats to the security of L.A. and sometimes the country.  The first season, or Day One as it is commonly referred to, introduces everyone to Jack's disfunctional family, Jack and his wife had recently been separated but are trying to work it out and his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) is constantly getting into some form of trouble as she is in the full swing of her rebellious teenage years.  As Jack is trying to piece back together the puzzle he calls life, a threat is received on one of the presidential candidates that happens to be visiting Los Angeles to drum up voters support.  Now this isn't just any presidential candidate, this is the first black candidate (Dennis Haysbert) to really have a chance at the White House, so an assassination attempt on his life could be catastrophic to the country's race relations.  At the same time this threat is received, Jack's daughter Kim, sneaks out of the house to hang out with a friend and two boys she doesn't know all that well.  All of this occurs in just the first hour of day one, and propels the season forward with plenty of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end of episode 24.With incredible acting and storytelling that leaves you wanting more at the end of every episode, it's no wonder that ""24"" is one of the best dramas on television.  The only drawback to the show is also it's strongest element which is the real-time format, it's excellent if you catch every episode, but if you miss one or two you pretty much have no clue as to what is going on.  However, there is hope for those who may have missed an episode and the solution is exactly what I'm reviewing now, the season box set.  So, whether you are a fan of the show or saw a few episodes and became intrigued but had no clue what had transpired before or after the point you came on board, this season box set is a definite must have.

599658,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00005JLF2,Kenji Fujishima,"[4, 4]","I perhaps have the strangest history with the FOX television series ""24."" This past fourth season was, in fact, the first whole season of ""24"" I caught from beginning to end. I barely caught anything from Season 1, caught the latter-half of Season 2, and did the same for Season 3. How weird is that? Well, this summer, after watching the wildly uneven but generally satisfying fourth season of this terrifically compelling action drama series, I'm trying to make amends for missing the complete first three seasons of ""24.""So I write this review not as a rabid fanatic of everything ""24,"" but as merely an interested viewer of the show. And, after catching up with this strong first season, I can see why this was considered such a powerful show when it first blasted onto the television scene in Fall 2001.The big gimmick of ""24,"" of course, is its real-time format; every season takes place over a span of 24 hours in a full day of the life of CTU agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) as he tries to save lives and prevent danger. Forget about the real-time concept; it's pretty loosely applied here anyway. The attraction of the show, I think, is that it expands the boundaries of the TV thriller. Not only does it embrace the serial concept---every episode follows from what happened before, and if you miss one, you may miss something crucial---but it uses the concept to add extra breadth to the season's convoluted thriller plot. Subplots abound in Season 1 involving, for instance, the personal affairs  of Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) as he discovers the truth about something that occurred seven years ago involving his son Keith (Vicellous Shannon). But, most importantly, the real-time format allows creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers to develop the various characters so that, as the events of this long day unfold, we become emotionally involved in what happens to these people. Not many action movies today even bother to emphasize characters and emotions in quite the way ""24"" does.This first season of ""24"" is far from perfect. Its second half is much more uneven than its near-perfect first half; the whole ""instant amnesia"" thing in the season's latter half was stupid enough that it almost made me fear that the season would never recover (which it did, handsomely). For a few episodes in the second half, the David Palmer subplots actually seem more interesting than the main terrorist-threat storyline. And the editorial reviewer is right; the final twist doesn't entirely make sense. In short, this season is not the most confidently-made and paced. Still, even as the momentum and tension threatened to dissipate by the season's halfway mark, the show proved to be intelligently written and well acted on a mostly consistent basis, and this was enough to compel me to watch from beginning to end.I give Kiefer Sutherland all the credit in the world for creating a characterization of Jack Bauer that never loses credibility for a second. His deep desperation as he tries to save both his family and the life of Senator Palmer is vividly conveyed; so is the love he feels for his family (even if his job at CTU means he isn't always there for them). Sutherland is the anchor that grounds this series' myriad plot twists in firm reality; Jack Bauer is a hero, but he's always a human one, and that's partly why he is such a compelling central figure in ""24.""And then there is Dennis Haysbert, who is almost perfectly cast as Senator David Palmer. Palmer is arguably a less credible figure than Bauer is: Palmer seems to be a noble political fantasy brought to life, since Palmer is a man who never sacrifices his principles in the name of politics, and who is always willing to tell the absolute truth to the American public. (In this show, he doesn't get burned by the public even when he admits to a behind-the-scenes scandal.)

Of course, I was wrong, because this is a series where things go from bad to worse and well beyond as Jack Bauer experiences &quot;the worst day of my life.&quot;  Creator Robert Cochran worked brilliantly within the confines of his grand design, where events happen simultaneously and in real time.  The official mission might be heading off an assassination attempt of presidential candidate Senator David Palmer on the day of the California primary, but there is always some pressing task at hand as the hits just keep on coming from start to finish in this show.  &quot;24&quot; is a series where the obvious goal was to throw everything at Jack Bauer and the other candidates, including a large number of kitchen sinks, mostly with regards to his family.I think the casting of Keifer Sutherland as Jack Bauer was strategic, because as the one &quot;movie star&quot; in the cast he stands out as larger than life against the rest of the ensemble.  The Sisyphus analogy is not meant to be superficial, because any sense of success at any given moment in the series is transitory at best.  Sutherland's performance holds the series together, but the true star is Cochran and his team of writers.  It is the story that gets you hooked and sweeps you along for the roller coaster ride as the bad things just keep happening.  Watching the show a second time (and in a shorter time span) gave me a better appreciation for how things were set up, which you do not really notice so much the first time through because you have to absorb all the rapid fire developments.  The second season is following the same pattern, and I fear it will be disappointing simply because the ending cannot have the emotional impact of what happens with Season One.  I would be surprised if Jack Bauer and company make it beyond 48 hours, but we shall see.Finally: One of the &quot;advantages&quot; of watching the complete first season of &quot;24&quot; on DVD is that you can do it less to start watching it straight through some time (of course, you have to start at midnight).

Things get a little more complicated when his family gets drawn into it...Kiefer Sutherland, Sarah Clark (who is GORGEOUS!), Dennis Haysbert, Carlos Bernard and most the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.  Moreover, 24 does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It's all about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.The major setbacks are in relation to:1) The whole car-falling-over-the-cliff with the daughter in it was too much.2) It gets worse when Kim not only survives the fall, but is also in great shape!!!3) If that wasn't bad enough, the wife suffers from amnesia (!!!) in typical soap opera fashion... Shameful!4) Dennis Hopper's sad attempt at a Serbian accent, which ended up being more an Italian one....5) The ridiculous escape from the dock by making use of hot coffee!6) The completely useless daughter.7) The very annoying wife.8) The involvement of Serbs (the Drazens) and the implication of Russians (Yelena) and Greeks (!) (Harris) as villains.  Not to mention that Germany is also somehow involved.  How original...On the positive side:1) 24 Sheds light on illegal covert operations carried out within the FR of Yugoslavia and aiming at assassinating people on US Government orders in 1999.2) Kiefer Sutherland and Sarah Clark have an amazing chemistry, while Dennis Haysbert and Carlos Bernard were born for their respective roles.3) A good, yet short guest appearance by Lou Diamond Philips.4) Good moral story with the senator doing the right thing in relation to his wife in the end.5) Very original to have the whole series be ""24 hours.""6) A good look into the dirty world of politics.In short, 24 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into. I wasn't really a big fan of Keifer Sutherland and the whole &quot;government agent trying to stop potential harm to a presidential candidate&quot; storyline sounded a little overdone, but I was in shock after I rented the first two volumes of the series. I admit you do have to sit and be patient through the first 15/20 minutes or so of the very first episode (so we can be introduced to the main cast), but then...thats when the action kicks in and the plot thickens. I became an addict to this show as I got to the end of the first show! &quot;Edge of your seat&quot; excitement was more than an expression...I really was sitting on the edge! The writing is superb along with the acting and the way the show is presented in &quot;Real time&quot; is an innovative approach to tv entertainment. There are alot of plot twists as you sit and go through the episodes and this is far from being a predictable show. Keifer's characters in other projects haven't always been likable but he does a great job portraying the dark hero. I only rented this because I didn't think it would be the type of show I'd watch again, but I'm ready to watch it all over again! If you're trying to watch the episodes on tv now with its 2nd season, you'll probably feel lost. You have to watch the first season first and its better to just wait for repeats or the dvd release of the 2nd season before beginning that. Take a chance on this set.

599697,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JLF2,Mark Baker,"[118, 132]","It's just after midnight at the Bauer home.  They're getting ready for bed when Jack gets a phone call asking him to report to work at the Counter Terrorism Unit in Los Angeles.  There he's briefed on a plot to assassinate Presidential candidate David Palmer.  Meanwhile, his daughter Kim has snuck out of the house to meet some guys who are bad news.  His wife Terri is finding trouble searching for Kim.  And Palmer is facing a crisis of his own concerning something in his family's past he didn't even know about.  It's going to be a long day for everyone.This thriller series is innovative.  Each episode represents just one hour in the day.  I wasn't sure they could pull if off, but the writers managed to keep all the plots going and make the gaps between seeing characters believable.  It quickly turned into a weekly addiction that had me glued to my seat and dreading commercials more then normal.  Some of the plots loose steam in the afternoon, but it builds up tension again for the climax, which was the best hour of television last season, period.Unfortunately, this set wasn't all it could have been.  They removed the ""previously on 24"" recaps, which are very useful if you just want to pop a random disc into the machine.  Ironically, they also don't have a play all feature, which would go well with no recaps.  The worst thing, in my opinion, is the lack of chapter breaks in each episode.  The season 1 intro (on the last disc) is ok and includes a mention of this season.  Of course, at this point, we're far beyond anything they would have told us in the set.  The best feature is the alternate ending.  While (to my surprise) I prefer the original, it's nice to see what might have been.  As you would expect, the picture and audio quality are top notch.It's a shame this great show didn't get the DVD treatment it deserved.  I'm willing to overlook the lack of extras because of timing, but the lack of the recap &amp; chapter breaks really bothers me.  Even so, it's a good set of a great show worth using to catch up or remember this innovative program.",4,Bet You Can't Watch Just One,1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,2080,"['just', 'midnight', 'Bauer', 'home', ""'re"", 'getting', 'ready', 'bed', 'when', 'Jack', 'phone', 'call', 'asking', 'report', 'work', 'Counter', 'Terrorism', 'Unit', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'briefed', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Meanwhile', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'snuck', 'house', 'meet', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'bad', 'news', 'wife', 'Terri', 'finding', 'trouble', 'searching', 'Kim', 'Palmer', 'facing', 'crisis', 'own', 'concerning', 'something', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'about', 'going', 'be', 'long', 'day', 'everyone.This', 'thriller', 'series', 'innovative', 'episode', 'just', 'one', 'hour', 'day', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'writers', 'managed', 'keep', 'plots', 'going', 'make', 'gaps', 'seeing', 'characters', 'believable', 'quickly', 'turned', 'weekly', 'addiction', 'had', 'glued', 'seat', 'dreading', 'commercials', 'more', 'then', 'normal', 'plots', 'loose', 'steam', 'afternoon', 'up', 'tension', 'again', 'climax', 'was', 'best', 'hour', 'television', 'last', 'season', 'period.Unfortunately', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'previously', '24', 'recaps', 'are', 'very', 'useful', 'just', 'want', 'pop', 'random', 'disc', 'machine', 'Ironically', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'play', 'feature', 'would', 'go', 'well', 'recaps', 'worst', 'thing', 'opinion', 'lack', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'episode', 'season', '1', 'intro', 'last', 'disc', 'ok', 'mention', 'season', 'course', 'point', ""'re"", 'far', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'set', 'best', 'feature', 'alternate', 'ending', 'surprise', 'prefer', 'original', 'nice', 'see', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'would', 'expect', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'top', 'notch.It', 'shame', 'great', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'deserved', ""'m"", 'willing', 'overlook', 'lack', 'extras', 'timing', 'lack', 'recap', 'amp', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'really', 'bothers', 'Even', 'so', 'good', 'set', 'great', 'show', 'worth', 'using', 'catch', 'up', 'remember', 'innovative', 'program']",24: Season 1

Honestly, if you watch one episode, you'll be drooling to see the next one.  In fact, most people go through this show on dvd very quickly as its hard to stop.  That being said, watching the episodes back to back lends itself to a few problems.  No this isn't about the fact that no one ever sleeps, naps, eats, or uses the bathroom.  That would make for lame television and I don't really care about that.  No the problem is with the fact that SOOO many things happen in such a short span, or episodes forget what happened before.  [BEGIN SPOILERS] For instance, there is a girl who is kidnapped, drugged, broken arm, hit by a car and in surgery within only a few hours.  Now, while this is possible, seeing it back to back makes you start to role your eyes in boredom.  What was next, he mom calls and tells her she was adopted?  Or she finds out that she's actually dead, and this is purgatory?  Also, watching the show back to back really made the biggest shocker, the traitor at the end of the series, far less believable.  Somehow, a character, who was set up to be killed by the bad guys, found out who another traitor was, and investigated her, as well as was the only reason Jack Bauer succeeded most the time was actually a traitor?  This was very unbelievable, and was disapointing. [END SPOILERS]That being said, the show is very entertaining.  I was hooked and enjoyed watching each episode, and was dying to see more.

The characters do some pretty stupid things, with Sutherland's daughter (a whiny Elisha Cuthbert) topping the list of dumbdoers with her Stockholm syndrome affection for a basically worthless guy who she thinks is okay because he helps her and mommy escape; but he's the one that got her in the mess in the first place.  Cuthbert continues to do stupid things that eventually end up in getting more people killed and her father and mother in further danger.  The disassociative amnesia plot with wife Leslie Hope is also a real hard concept to accept.  Dennis Haysbert as the African/American presidential hopeful plays his role with stoic power, but his family problems tend to get tedious and repetitive, with his wife being a real pain in the buttuski (although Penny Jarold is quite good in the role).  Sarah Clarke as Sutherland's sidekick Nina is quite good as is Carlos Bernard as her beau Tony.  The cast overall is exceptional:  Xander Berkeley, Richard Burgi, Zeljo Ivanek, even Dennis Hopper with his horrible Bulgarian accent is effective.  Credit goes to the writers/directors for keeping things addictively entertaining, although the last episode is quite shocking in its revelations.  All in all, 24 was a unique attempt at intelligent drama and succeeded on the most part.

If you missed an episode, it was very hard to keep up. The product of watching 24 episodes spread out over a longer time period hurt the show quite a bit. But watching the episodes back-to-back in this DVD set, the sense of continuity shone through.The DVD extras are lacking, but the episodes have solid video and audio quality.

One of the most popular shows on Fox is now available to own on DVD.  They're all right here, waiting for you.  &quot;24&quot; is an explosive series that brings non-stop action and nail-biting drama right to your door.Jack Bauer is the head of the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit, CTU.  He is about to have one bad day, as there is an assassination plot in the works that targets a presidential candidate.  What's worse is that the same group behind the plot wants Jack and his family dead, as well.  Presented to us in real time (with each show representing an hour), we are plunged directly into the crisis with front-row seats.  The results are unbelievable; that much I can tell you.  These twenty-four episodes will drain every bit of energy out of you... and you'll love every minute.Once you start with the very fist episode, you are hooked.  Every one of them is a cliff-hanger, which makes it very hard for you to stop watching when you need to.  Trust me when I say this; this show does NOT let you off the hook for one second.  Anything you think that can't go wrong, does; anything that you think cannot get compromised, does.  You have to be prepared to be caught off guard every single moment.  You also have to expect that you're going to have to endure horrifying tragedies along with the short and triumphant victories.This is a wonderful and addicting show, as hard as it is to watch at times.  The storyline is ingenious, delivering one explosive and mesmerizing plot.  The acting is extremely superb and makes everything work.  Kiefer Sutherland does a terrific job at playing the lead role of a resourceful agent and a caring father.  You want to believe that he'll be able to overtake anybody or anything that gets in his way.There are some neat special features included, as well.  One of the best things about this show is that it is widescreen (and it's even enhanced for 16:4 televisions).  The picture and sound quality is really great; making you feel that you are watching a real movie.  While the DVD set isn't explosive when it comes to special features, the set includes an intro from Kiefer Sutherland, an alternate ending to the season finale,  and an episode booklet.&quot;24&quot; is a powerful and suspenseful series that will knock the air right out of your body.  There's no going back once you start.  No matter how many times you may not want to know what happens next (for fear that you will experience something terrible), you press on and continue with the next episode.  This is ADDICTING; be for warned.  From start to finish, this is one explosive and unpredictable machine that strikes with full furry and unquestionable force.

599719,A3T5NSG7LMRY0A,B00005JLF2,Michael Gmirkin,"[0, 1]","Love the show. Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).Season 1 was good. It set the bar, which subsequent seasons have subsequently surpassed. I highly suggest watching the season in order. Some things in later seasons don't completely make sense unless you've seen the prior seasons. Though, enough lip service is paid to previous seasons that it's not a complete hardship if you haven't seen them. Still... Good to see the whole thing start to finish.Story's good. Has a few ""suspension of disbelief"" moments (more so than usual, though obviously for much of the series you have to suspend disbelief to watch the exploits of nearly-invincible super-agent Jack Bauer), and a few hokey moments. But overall, an enjoyable attention-grabbing ride.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 1, as I recall, was a bit light on bonus materials. Subsequent seasons included more bonus features. As I recall, season 1 didn't chapter-break its episodes. But, the video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well.

After the X-files was cancelled/ended i thought it would be the last decent thing i would watch. I never bothered to try watching ""24"" until episode 6 or 7.  The concept of the show obviously is 24 hrs is the season while each hour is in real-time (1hr per episode or 45min with commericals).  The only issue i see with this show is the drama.  If you were to spend 1 hr to watch 1 episode a day it would be fine but if you had never seen it b4 you want to watch it every second you have.  There are many people who really dont have the attention span for that.The producers of the show & everyone who is involved in the series has done ""alot"" of work cuz this show is not something that can be done overnight, they had to have planned the entire season out before putting it on video.  I have noticed quite alot of plotholes in all (or most) the seasons where some things are taking longer then it should but yet they went with it. It might have been to make the show less boring to mix drama (ie: the president's issues) with the action & suspense but sometimes it looks like it gets in the way of the main plot.  Either way i guess most people who like this show doesnt mind it.As for the DVD portion of this show its all good except for the programming.  They definatly needed to put chapters into each episodes instead of putting it into one big long episode.  Granted that TV-DVD's were not exceptinally popular & i guess Fox or whoever manufactured this DVD package thought it would just be faster to throw each episode on one chapter.  But now since they are popular they should have changed it by now.  I recently got this season on DVD & im suprised they never changed anything on it.  Also another thing iv'e noticed too is there is no recap on this dvd set (they figured it would give the viewer more time to watch the set) but there are dvd sets (other shows) that can give you the option if you want a recap or not.There are alot of flaws in both the series & this DVD collection but its a great concept & a great series.  And hopefully season 5 (& possibly more) will be a great contribute to the rest of the show.

Moore,"[13, 13]","With the possible exception of ""The Sopranos,"" there was no more exciting, compulsively watchable, edge-of-your-seat TV show last season than ""24."" It wasn't just the momentum of the conspiracy plot that kept us watching, but the profusion of deftly sketched, impeccably cast characters. It was a fascinating guessing game to figure out which ones were clean, which ones were dirty, which ones would get killed off that episode, which ones would prove integral to the plot, which ones would disappear and never come back, etc. It will be interesting to see which ones left standing at the end will figure in next year's story! One thing that's certain is that Kiefer Sutherland has the role of a lifetime as Jack Bauer; if Bauer doesn't do for him what Andy Sipowicz did for Dennis Franz or Tony Soprano did for James Gandolfini, there's no justice in Hollywood (and of course there isn't, but occasionally deserving actors DO get recognized). The show had its flaws; one could rightfully complain that Dennis Hopper hammed it up a little too much as Victor Drazen, or that Teri's hysterical amnesia was a little too convenient (though if any character in TV history had a right to hysterical amnesia, it was Teri Bauer!). Nevertheless, the show was so strongly plotted and written in general, and so full of breathtaking surprises, that it deserves to be ranked as one of the classic action-suspense programs of all time.",5,The shining star of the 2001-02 TV season.,1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,1422,"['possible', 'exception', 'Sopranos', 'was', 'more', 'exciting', 'compulsively', 'watchable', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'TV', 'show', 'last', 'season', '24', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'momentum', 'conspiracy', 'plot', 'kept', 'watching', 'profusion', 'deftly', 'sketched', 'impeccably', 'cast', 'characters', 'was', 'fascinating', 'guessing', 'game', 'figure', 'out', 'ones', 'were', 'clean', 'ones', 'were', 'dirty', 'ones', 'would', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'episode', 'ones', 'would', 'prove', 'integral', 'plot', 'ones', 'would', 'disappear', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'etc', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'ones', 'left', 'standing', 'end', 'will', 'figure', 'next', 'year', 'story', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'role', 'lifetime', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Bauer', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'Andy', 'Sipowicz', 'did', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'did', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'justice', 'Hollywood', 'course', ""n't"", 'occasionally', 'deserving', 'actors', 'DO', 'get', 'recognized', 'show', 'had', 'flaws', 'one', 'could', 'rightfully', 'complain', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'hammed', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Victor', 'Drazen', 'Teri', 'hysterical', 'amnesia', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'convenient', 'character', 'TV', 'history', 'had', 'right', 'hysterical', 'amnesia', 'was', 'Teri', 'Bauer', 'Nevertheless', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'strongly', 'plotted', 'written', 'general', 'so', 'full', 'breathtaking', 'surprises', 'be', 'ranked', 'one', 'classic', 'action-suspense', 'programs', 'time']",24: Season 1

At midnight, Jack gets a call from work saying that there has been a threat on presidential nominee Senator David Palmer's ( Dennis Hayworth) life. He is assigned to come up with a strategy to keep Palmer alive. But this is where the story gets interesting. The terrorists manage to get their hands on his wife Teri (Lesli Hope) and his daughter Kim ( Elisha Cuthbert). The terrorists now have leverage over Jack, and he must find a way to keep the Senator alive without getting his wife and daughter killed. Watch Jack in action as he lives on the edge and plays by his own rules, leaving procedure and protocal far behind...&quot;24&quot; is a brilliant show that offers plenty of action and suspense to keep you hooked from the first show on. The format of the show is one that has never been done before, because it is done in real time. This means that each show consists of one hour of a 24 hour day. In my opinion, Kiefer Sutherland gives the best performance of his career as Jack Bauer. Sutherland's performance is so good, that you literally find yourself rooting for him throughout the entire show. Dennis Hayworth is superb as Senator David Palmer. He is the first African American presidential nominee in history. You not only get to see him worry about his campaign, but deal with his extremely disfunctional family in the process. Leslie Hope and Elisha Cuthbert also did an outstanding job as Jack's family. Their performances are very realistic and you actually come to care about their characters. The rest of the cast includes great actors like Dennis Hopper, Sarah Clarke, Carlos Bernand, Penny Johnson, and Eric Balfour.&quot;24&quot; has the perfect mix of action, drama, and suspense. The acting is absolutely superb all the way around, and each character has an important part to play that could seriously effect the events of the story. The DVD is definately worth the money. You get to see the show without commercial interruption and with awesome picture and sound quality as well.

The series succeeds in creating fully dimensional villians and heroes. Almost Shakespearean, is the relationship between President Dave Palmer and his devilish wife Sherry.But of course the real engine of this series is Jack Bauer played with great power by Kiefer Sutherland. Sutherland makes a great rebel, always butting heads with government bureacracy and in a way the subtext of this series is the frustration we all feel when the bureacracy slows us down with its turgid self-serving functionaries.I should warn you that once you start a season, it's impossible to stop.

Kiefer Sutherland, in the role he was born to play, shines as America's most deadly counter-terrorist agent. Due to the nature of the show, the main cast changes frequently due to character death and betrayal, but no matter who is by his side, Sutherland gives Emmy-award winning displays throughout the seven seasons and film.How does 24 work? Each season is set in one 24 hour day. There are 24 episodes, each lasting one hour of ""real time"" in Jack Bauer's life. These aren't your average days however, they are filled to the brink with terrorism, explosions, conflict and anger. The ideas come from real world fears, including threats of assassinations, nuclear bombs, pathogen outbreaks, suicide bombers and more. Although some of the latter seasons do recycle old ideas with a fresh twist, the writer's have always come up with new ways to shock the audiences.

What it actually is about is a revenge plot against two people involved in murder of a Bosnian politico and his family.Now this show is real time. Each 41 minute episode, including credits, represents one hour of the day. 24 hours = 24 episodes.This show is very innovative in its approach but very contrived in its execution.  The best example is Jack's wife and daughter.  They get kidnapped, they escape.  They get taken to a safe house, the safe house is attacked but they escape and get seperated.  The wife gets amnesia but somehow gets to restaurant were she is know but with a boyfriend, not Jack.  The boyfriend takes her home and then they get attacked by the terrorists at her home but are rescued by CTU.  The daughter flees to he kidnapper's home - don't ask - and then gets involved with a drug buy and is arrested.  When she is finally released, the police take her to CTU but she is abducted on the way by the terrorist.  And this is a subplot.The weird thing is that this show is totally laughable but you cannot wait for the next episode to air.  You have to credit great directing, fantastic acting and taught and imaginative editing.Now the following issues with the DVD set:The episodes do not have chapter marks.  I was having problens with the picture and took the disc to wipe.  When I went back to the episode, I had to scan through the entire episode until I got back to where I stopped.Also, there is a special feature on disc 6 that introduces the entire season.  So why is this not on disc 1 at the start????This is a fun show - probably reminiscent to the old movie serials of the 30's and 40's but updated to the current century.  Enjoy this show and forgive the shows short comings.",4,The Show You Love Despite the Implausabilities,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,2063,"['show', 'had', 'bad', 'luck', 'premiering', 'two', 'months', '9-11', 'subject', 'matter', 'almost', 'did', 'not', 'premiere', 'know', 'show', 'CTU', 'counter', 'terrorist', 'unit', 'Day', '1', 'deals', 'premise', 'asassination', 'Presidential', 'contender', 'day', 'California', 'Primary.Well', 'premise', 'are', 'told', 'What', 'actually', 'revenge', 'plot', 'two', 'people', 'involved', 'murder', 'Bosnian', 'politico', 'family.Now', 'show', 'real', 'time', '41', 'minute', 'episode', 'including', 'credits', 'one', 'hour', 'day', '24', 'hours', '=', '24', 'episodes.This', 'show', 'very', 'innovative', 'approach', 'very', 'contrived', 'execution', 'best', 'example', 'Jack', 'wife', 'daughter', 'get', 'kidnapped', 'escape', 'get', 'taken', 'safe', 'house', 'safe', 'house', 'attacked', 'escape', 'get', 'seperated', 'wife', 'amnesia', 'somehow', 'restaurant', 'were', 'know', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'Jack', 'boyfriend', 'home', 'then', 'get', 'attacked', 'terrorists', 'home', 'are', 'rescued', 'CTU', 'daughter', 'kidnapper', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'then', 'involved', 'drug', 'buy', 'arrested', 'When', 'finally', 'released', 'police', 'take', 'CTU', 'abducted', 'way', 'terrorist', 'subplot.The', 'weird', 'thing', 'show', 'totally', 'laughable', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'next', 'episode', 'air', 'have', 'credit', 'great', 'directing', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'taught', 'imaginative', 'editing.Now', 'following', 'issues', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'chapter', 'marks', 'was', 'having', 'problens', 'picture', 'took', 'disc', 'wipe', 'When', 'went', 'back', 'episode', 'had', 'scan', 'entire', 'episode', 'got', 'back', 'where', 'stopped.Also', 'special', 'feature', 'disc', '6', 'entire', 'season', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'disc', '1', 'start', 'fun', 'show', 'probably', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'movie', 'serials', '30', '40', 'updated', 'current', 'century', 'Enjoy', 'show', 'forgive', 'shows', 'short', 'comings']",24: Season 1

599744,A179GX8E3M4G52,B00005JLF2,"Mr D. ""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[2, 5]","Terrorists are about to assassinate a U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate, David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) on the day of the California Presidential primary. An agent in Malaysia warns the C.T.U. that an assassin is enroute to LA for this assignment.Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), head of the LA office of the C.T.U. - Counter Terrorism Unit - is called from home, for this emergency. After apologies to his family Teri (Leslie Hope) and teenage daughter Kimberly (Elisha Cuthbert), Bauer leaves to catch some terrorists.Seemingly unrelated, Kimberly sneaks off to meet a friend and later meets some boys at a furniture store, where one of them works. Teri discovers Kimberly is missing and calls Jack, who by now is deep into his investigation and can't get away. Eventually it becomes apparent that the terrorists have a mole in C.T.U. and that Kimberly is held hostage of the bad guys. Later Teri is tricked and is taken hostage too.WHATZ GOODActionIt's not like a movie but for a low budget TV show, the action and sets were decent, asOverall B-SuspenseThey managed to keep the show suspenseful. As the story unfolded almost all the main characters except Bauer and the Senator and Bauer's family seemed to be hiding something, in cahoots with the bad guys or out on their own agenda. Overall B+Da Story prosThe story was good in some places and weak in others. Being a TV show, each ending segment was seasoned with a teaser to entice you to return next week. The problems I had with the story will be discussed later. Overall it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Overall C+WHATZ BADCastI can't say I really liked anyone in the cast and I actually disliked several actors. It wasn't their acting, I just couldn't warm up to them.The actor that I liked best was Dennis Haysbert (Senator Palmer), he did a reasonably good job but I didn't like his wife who is a pushy hag. I realize I wasn't supposed to like her but I didn't like her before it was obvious she was a hag. I also thought the son Curt, was miscast.Another actor who I liked was CTU's third in command Tony Alameda (Carlos Bernard)who did a good job of alternating between being helpful and looking suspicious. Bauer's second in command Nina Myers (Sarah Clark)never gained my interest. She looked too much like a Sunday School teacher.I also didn't like the casting of Jack Bauer's wife and daughter. They were OK but not great.As for Jack Bauer himself, hey I like Kiefer Sutherland alright, he's made some good movies but I had difficulty placing him as a big tough former special forces/swat team macho type. Overall DActing and DirectingGenerally the acting was acceptable but because of the enormous length of the story there obviously was some dull places and the acting and directing slipped in these areas. Haysbert and Sutherland did the best acting. Most of the rest were situational so the acting was more passive. There were numerous other actors involved through the course of these twenty-four episodes who gave performances of fair to good. Overall CDa Story consFrom a story stand point I think the writers tried to cram too much into their self imposed 24 hours. For instance Kimberly along with her friend gets kidnapped, then escapes, then gets caught, then meets up with her captured mom, rescued by Jack, sent to a safe house, almost killed, escapes again, then gets arrested, gets captured again and more all in twenty-four hours.How about this, at approx. 8 am it appears Jack has gone rogue. Within two hours a temporary Director is appointed in his place. Then another and before four oclock a third temporary Director is on the job. I find it incongruous that Jack's boss could have even appointed a single replacement in that timeframe let alone implementing three such changes in eight hours. Where were these people hanging out at the corner coffee shop? . Overall F+Other annoying thingsOf course this is because it was a TV show but I really got tired of hearing Sutherland doing his this is the longest day of my life monologue. CTU, have you heard of it? Me either. Stands for Counter Terrorism Unit. Maybe they weren't allowed to use a real agency but if they were I would have preferred it.So What Do I Think?After the first two four show discs of six total, 24 had me. It is a grabber and I would have given it five stars. With the next two discs I began to see cracks in the facade. These things are more noticeable when you watch eight episodes at a weekly sitting instead of one. After a while it seemed like we were rehashing old material. Like the travails of Kimberly, in, out, in, out, in, out, etc.In the last eight hours we got to see head bad guy, played by Dennis Hooper, whose hands Kimberly was of course and he picked things up a little but the ending fell flat.CONCLUSIONI know a lot of people raved about this show but then again a lot of people rave about Clive Cusslers silly books. What's the connection, nothing unless silliness is a connection.Like I have intimated, this series would fly a lot better as a TV show than as a DVD mini serial movie. But since it was released that way and that's the way I saw it, that's the way I have to review it. After all we're not reviewing TV shows. In summary, it was exciting but the excitement dragged on too long and was fraught with redundancy. The acting and directing were average and the story was inconsistent. Last, too much happened in their twenty-four hour period. More than could realistically have happened in my world.",3,XXIV Could Have Been Better,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,5496,"['Terrorists', 'are', 'assassinate', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'Presidential',

The idea of waiting one week (and occasionally longer) was frustrating because I wanted to know what would happen next.  Unfortunately, I got sidetracked in the middle of the season and having missed a couple episodes, knew I had to wait for the DVD release.How good is this show?  Even knowing certain key facts about the conclusion (gleaned from second season commercials which I couldn't avoid), I still found the show to be thrilling from beginning to end.The plot of the show deals with government agent Jack Bauer who has his wife and daughter kidnaped by mysterious figures who also intend to kill a presidential candidate.  There are enough twists to turn this straightforward idea into an intricate pretzel, and though there are the occasional last minute rescues, you never feel cheated by what's going on.Beyond the story, what adds to this show is that everyone - both good guys and bad guys - are very professional.  Jack is up against some formidable foes, but he is quite formidable himself.  He is human, however, and you never quite know how things are going to turn out.While the real-time concept of the show often stretches (the characters can seeming zip between any two points in the LA area in half an hour), it never breaks.  Think of this boxed set as an eighteen hour action movie that never lets up.  Actually, this is better than 99% of the action movies out there, so it is well worth the price.

599759,A1SV22OU1E7XRX,B00005JLF2,ocarolan,"[19, 31]","I purchased Season One, never having seen a single episode, on the strength of a friend's recommendation, and watched it in its entirety over the span of about ten evenings. I stuck with it only because my wife enjoyed it and I didn't want to be a spoilsport, which required that I suppress my urge to laugh out loud at the outlandish plot twists, which were many, and the cardboard characters.There is not a moment of Season One that I found believable. Start with the production values, which are strictly made-for-TV. Little of the series appears to be filmed on location, and the obvious sound stage and back lot settings set a tone of artificiality that, given the plotting, is probably appropriate. Note how Bauer's wife and daughter seemingly can run miles eluding their kidnappers and never break a sweat. And because so many of the scenes are filmed on a sound stage, the lighting is often intrusively unrealistic. (In one scene, one of Victor Drazen's sons is talking face to face with Bauer's daughter, and as the camera switches from one to the other, it is always the right side of their faces that is illuminated.)The plot reminds me of a Robert Ludlum novel in which the hero is confronted by a sinister, shadowy organization whose reach is unlimited and whose minions are everywhere.  Gosh, to whom can a hero turn in such circumstances?  Why, to the writers! One can usually bank on a kidnapping and an escape, but here there seems to be an endless series of each.  Why is a farfetched escape from a 747 - which is destroyed in the process, killing all passengers - required to secure the credentials of a photographer, who is later replaced by a double, when Drazen's all-powerful organization should easily have been able to eliminate the photographer and make the swap after his arrival in LA? Why would the government build an elaborate, secret detention facility, and instead of locating it at a secure site, put it under - yes, under - a tract of farmland to which anyone, apparently, has access?  (A facility so secret it takes CTU staff all of about a minute to access a detailed map of it.) The absurdities peak when Bauer's wife and daughter are escaping from their kidnappers in a car, and his wife pulls off on a side road and exits the car, telling her daughter ""I'll see if they're still following us."" As she begins to trot down the road to check things out (exactly what she would do if they were still being followed is anybody's guess), the car, with daughter inside, rolls over an embankment (oooops!) and down into a ravine, where it bursts into flames. Seeing this, Ma Bauer collapses, and when she revives - ta-da! - she's suffering from traumatic amnesia! If you can watch this plot twist without laughing out loud, you're a better man than I.  It goes without saying that daughter Bauer miraculously survives all this, only to face... that's right, yet another kidnapping.Just when it appears that the script couldn't get more hokey (my apologies to any Virginia Tech alumni reading this), the writers turned to casting for their pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance: Dennis Hopper as the Serbian war criminal Victor Drazen, whose desire for revenge set all this malarkey in motion.  I'll wager that every community theater group from Portland to Poughkeepsie has at least one member who could have played credibly the part of Victor Drazen, as written, and whose anonymity would have worked to the role's favor (as it did for the character Gaines). Instead, we get Dennis Hopper, who, in this role, is never for a second anyone but Dennis Hopper. (There is a point early in his time on screen when I thought Hopper was struggling to keep a straight face, when I thought he might laugh out loud and say, ""sorry, guys, this is the best Serbian accent I can do.""  But, trooper that he is, Hopper sucked it up and soldiered on.)  Finally, the fact the action unfolds in real time added nothing - I found it to be an empty gimmick.Compared to the drivel the networks - ABC, CBS, NBC - turn out, ""24"" may merit four stars, perhaps five, but when judged next to ""The Wire,"" or even ""The Shield,"" two stars is generous.",2,Perfect fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000,1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,4150,"['purchased', 'Season', 'One', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'strength', 'friend', 'recommendation', 'watched', 'entirety', 'span', 'about', 'ten', 'evenings', 'stuck', 'only', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spoilsport', 'required', 'suppress', 'urge', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'outlandish', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'many', 'cardboard', 'characters.There', 'not', 'moment', 'Season', 'One', 'found', 'believable', 'Start', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'strictly', 'made-for-TV', 'Little', 'series', 'be', 'filmed', 'location', 'obvious', 'sound', 'stage', 'back', 'lot', 'settings', 'set', 'tone', 'artificiality', 'given', 'plotting', 'probably', 'appropriate', 'Note', 'how', 'Bauer', 'wife', 'daughter', 'seemingly', 'can', 'run', 'miles', 'eluding', 'kidnappers', 'never', 'break', 'sweat', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'sound', 'stage', 'lighting', 'often', 'intrusively', 'unrealistic', 'one', 'scene', 'one', 'Victor', 'Drazen', 'sons', 'talking', 'face', 'face', 'Bauer', 'daughter', 'camera', 'one', 'other', 'always', 'right', 'side', 'illuminated', 'plot', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'novel', 'hero', 'confronted', 'sinister', 'shadowy', 'organization', 'reach', 'unlimited', 'minions', 'are', 'everywhere', 'Gosh', 'whom', 'can', 'hero', 'turn', 'such', 'circumstances', 'Why', 'writers', 'One', 'can', 'usually', 'bank', 'kidnapping', 'escape', 'here', 'there', 'be', 'endless', 'series', 'Why', 'farfetched', 'escape', '747', 'destroyed', 'process', 'killing', 'passengers', 'required', 'secure', 'credentials', 'photographer', 'who', 'later', 'replaced', 'double', 'when', 'Drazen', 'all-powerful', 'organization', 'should', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'eliminate', 'photographer', 'make', 'swap', 'arrival', 'LA', 'Why', 'would', 'government', 'build', 'elaborate', 'secret', 'detention', 'facility', 'instead', 'locating', 'secure', 'site', 'put', 'yes', 'tract', 'farmland', 'anyone', 'apparently', 'access', 'facility', 'so', 'secret', 'CTU', 'staff', 'minute', 'access', 'detailed', 'map', 'absurdities', 'peak', 'when', 'Bauer', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'escaping', 'kidnappers', 'car', 'wife', 'off', 'side', 'road', 'car', 'telling', 'daughter', ""'ll"", 'see', ""'re"", 'still', 'following', 'trot', 'down', 'road', 'check', 'things', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'still', 'being', 'followed', 'anybody', 'guess', 'car', 'daughter', 'inside', 'embankment', 'down', 'ravine', 'where', 'flames', 'Seeing', 'Ma', 'Bauer', 'when', 'ta-da', 'suffering', 'traumatic', 'amnesia', 'can', 'watch', 'plot', 'twist', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', ""'re"", 'better', 'man', 'saying', 'daughter', 'Bauer', 'miraculously', 'only', 'face', 'right', 'yet', 'kidnapping.Just', 'when', 'script', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'hokey', 'apologies', 'Virginia', 'Tech', 'reading', 'writers', 'turned', 'casting', 'pi', 'egrave', 'ce', 'r', 'eacute', 'sistance', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Serbian', 'war', 'criminal', 'Victor', 'Drazen', 'desire', 'revenge', 'set', 'malarkey', 'motion', ""'ll"", 'wager', 'community', 'theater', 'group', 'Portland', 'Poughkeepsie', 'least', 'one', 'member', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'credibly', 'part', 'Victor', 'Drazen', 'written', 'anonymity', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'role', 'favor', 'did', 'character', 'Gaines', 'Instead', 'get', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'who', 'role', 'never', 'second', 'anyone', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'point', 'early', 'time', 'screen', 'when', 'thought', 'Hopper', 'was', 'struggling', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'when', 'thought', 'might', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'say', 'sorry', 'guys', 'best', 'Serbian', 'accent', 'can', 'do', 'Hopper', 'sucked', 'up', 'soldiered', 'Finally', 'fact', 'action', 'real', 'time', 'added', 'nothing', 'found', 'be', 'empty', 'gimmick.Compared', 'drivel', 'networks', 'ABC', 'CBS', 'NBC', 'turn', 'out', '24', 'may', 'merit', 'four', 'stars', 'perhaps', 'five', 'when', 'judged', 'next', 'Wire', 'even', 'Shield', 'two', 'stars', 'generous']",24: Season 1

So I bought the DVDs to make sure I had a clear view of the ""unmissable"" event.Unmissable my arse.24 is poorly plotted, poorly scripted and dreadfully acted. The plot is so bad that you'd have to be a paranoid conspiracy theorist of a Branch Davidian calibre, or perhaps just a bit dim, to buy into it. It isn't the fact that there are plot holes - though there are many and they are big, deep and wide - but that the plot is so ridiculously contrived and improbable (not to mention pea-brained) that such whopping plot holes could even be possible in the first place.Let's say you want to assassinate an aspiring presidential candidate on the day of a primary (so he's not even a presidential candiate yet!). Do you, in the space of twenty-four hours (a) infiltrate the CIA's counter-terrorism unit in order to ensure a specific agent is assigned to the candidate, kidnap that agent's daughter (using an extremely precarious, long-winded, and low-probability of sucess plot which relies heavily on two stoner teenagers and a van), tail and then kidnap his wife, send the agent on a wild goose chase, hire a trained assassin to steal the idenity of a photographer then escape from and blow up (all in mid-air) a jet airliner, hack the CCTV system of a hospital, all the while anticipating and dealing with every possible unexpected contingency and ... (sorry, but that's as far as I've got, so you'll have to use your imagination for the remaining eighteen spisodes) or (b) engage a professional marksman to shoot him next time he's at a public outdoor appearance?You wouldn't be a million miles out if you guessed that option (b) doesn't feature in any of the episodes I watched.

There are currently six seasons and season seven is planned for 2009. Each season has 6 discs, with 4 episodes per disc. Each episode covers approximately 1 hour of real-time drama although there are breaks for television advertising time meaning each episode lasts for about 45 min. To date there is approximately 6 days worth of 24 viewing. Each season is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next 24 days. It has won Emmy and Golden Globe awards. It has already achieved some of highest viewer rates for any television show.The real-time nature makes it unique along with its split screen type editing where more than one scene can take place at a time. There is also the clock with its ominous digital ticking that seems more like a countdown even though it is moving forward in time.The discs are held in a cardboard and plastic flip holder. It slides into the slim line box. It is not that easy to remove but this increases the security of the discs. The sound is in 5:1 Dolby Digital and the show is shot in 1.78 : 1.24 season 1 is mostly about Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) head of CTU (counter-terrorist unit) who suddenly discovers he is made part of an undercover plot to assassinate Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert). Soon his wife and daughter are caught up in the events. Each episode becomes an edge of your seat thriller with lots of plot twists and character turns.Overall the show has very high production values although this was one of the early DVD TV releases and so the transfer quality is similar to the birth of DVD. Sometimes the widescreen bars produce fluffy edges. However, overall these minor glitches are forgivable because the story is so captivating although at times the suspension of disbelief is sometimes stretched to the maximum (how many times can someone get kidnapped in one day?). Still you would be hard pressed not to want to see it because overall it is a non-stop rush of action and suspense. Give it a go and see if you want to enjoy some more.

This was a great (COPIED) idea (a drama occurring in real time) that went wrecklessly awry. Sutherlands talents were abused by terrible editing, directing, and a convoluted story line that read more like the never ending 3rd world soap opera. I rented the entire DVD series, and skipped about every other disk in order to keep my sanity.  It wasn't difficult to determine who the traitor was within 30 minutes of the first installment.  This series portrays the intelligence community like the 3 stooges, and the criminals like the masterminds (Do we really need more of that?) In addition, if Jack Bauer's daughter was truly that stupid, for God's sake, let the bad guys keep her.  Dennis Hopper turned in a strong performance, possibly being the single saving grace of the entire catastrophe.  The 'Senator' was the only character who drew any respect from me at all.

599768,A26XCS3QLDJJWN,B00005JLF2,"Patrick G. Varine ""Make beats, not war, haha...""","[3, 6]","(Sigh)... I know that it's unfair that I compare everything to ""The Shield,"" my current standard-bearer for fantastic television.But, that said, this first season of ""24"" is pretty damned good, and entertaining. I was a little unsure about how the writers were going to make a real-time drama work, and esPECially, how they were planning to stretch it out over 24 episodes. That's a long season for ANY show, let alone one whose plots HAVE to intersect every week.Basically, Counterterrorist Agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is initially out to keep a black presidential candidate safe from assassination. Before long, however, the plot involves Bauer's family, as well as a motive that has little to do with Palmer's quest for the White House.However, as we got closer and closer to the end, things started to unravel a little. The final double-cross of the series, plain and simple, just doesn't make a lot of sense. Dennis Hopper does -- seriously -- a Count Dracula impression as a Serbian terrorist. His character's son -- I don't know his real name, but he played D.A. Ed Danvers on NBC's ""Homicide"" -- does a much better job with the accent.CINEMA/TV GEEK TRIVIA: I don't know what shot first, this or the first season of ""The Shield,"" but there are a TON of ancillary characters from ""Shield"" on here, including:- Palmer's son, who tried to kill Shane Vendrell in season three of ""The Shield.""- Some Hispanic guy, who played the thorny-crown-tattoo-bearing leader of the Las Profetas gang, also in season three.- The agent who led a team of agents Bauer busted played the Sperm-Saving Rapist on season one, as well as playing the cop who got his ear cut off in Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs.""But all in all, this is a tightly-scripted drama that keeps you pretty much on the edge of your seat. Having started about four seasons too late, some of the cliffhangers aren't, well, as cliffhangy, because it's clear what their resolution will be. But that didn't stop me from going ""What the *$&! is gonna happen next?!"" a couple of times.Most interesting to me was the transformation of Sen. David Palmer's wife, from the perfect politician's wife at the series' beginning, to a conniving, power-hungry player by the time it ends.As I mentioned before, the final double-cross seems a bit hokey... maybe I need to re-watch some of the earlier episodes and see if I pick up on it. There is also a little bout with instant amnesia that is tough to believe, but it doesn't have all that much to do with the overall story.Did I enjoy it? Sure. Is it better than ""The Shield,"" or HBO's ""The Wire?"" No, not really. But it was still very good, and considering the end of the first season, I think I'm beginning to see how Bauer's character takes a turn into darker psychological territory, and I think I'm interested to see how his next assignment works out...",4,Pretty damned entertaining,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,2866,"['Sigh', 'know', 'unfair', 'compare', 'everything', 'Shield', 'current', 'standard-bearer', 'fantastic', 'television.But', 'said', 'first', 'season', '24', 'pretty', 'damned', 'good', 'entertaining', 'was', 'little', 'unsure', 'how', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'real-time', 'drama', 'work', 'esPECially', 'how', 'were', 'planning', 'stretch', 'out', '24', 'episodes', 'long', 'season', 'ANY', 'show', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'plots', 'HAVE', 'intersect', 'week.Basically', 'Counterterrorist', 'Agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'initially', 'out', 'keep', 'black', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'safe', 'assassination', 'long', 'however', 'plot', 'Bauer', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'motive', 'little', 'do', 'Palmer', 'quest', 'White', 'House.However', 'got', 'closer', 'closer', 'end', 'things', 'started', 'unravel', 'little', 'final', 'double-cross', 'series', 'plain', 'simple', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'seriously', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'impression', 'Serbian', 'terrorist', 'character', 'son', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'name', 'played', 'D.A', 'Ed', 'Danvers', 'NBC', 'Homicide', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'accent.CINEMA/TV', 'GEEK', 'TRIVIA', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'shot', 'first', 'first', 'season', 'Shield', 'are', 'TON', 'ancillary', 'characters', 'Shield', 'here', 'including', 'Palmer', 'son', 'who', 'tried', 'kill', 'Shane', 'Vendrell', 'season', 'three', 'Shield', 'Hispanic', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'thorny-crown-tattoo-bearing', 'leader', 'Las', 'Profetas', 'gang', 'also', 'season', 'three.-', 'agent', 'who', 'led', 'team', 'agents', 'Bauer', 'busted', 'played', 'Sperm-Saving', 'Rapist', 'season', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'cop', 'who', 'got', 'ear', 'cut', 'off', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'tightly-scripted', 'drama', 'pretty', 'much', 'edge', 'seat', 'Having', 'started', 'four', 'seasons', 'too', 'late', 'cliffhangers', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'cliffhangy', 'clear', 'what', 'resolution', 'will', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'going', 'What', '*', 'gon', 'happen', 'next', 'couple', 'times.Most', 'interesting', 'was', 'transformation', 'Sen.', 'David', 'Palmer', 'wife', 'perfect', 'politician', 'wife', 'series', 'beginning', 'conniving', 'power-hungry', 'player', 'time', 'mentioned', 'final', 'double-cross', 'bit', 'hokey', 'maybe', 'need', 're-watch', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'see', 'pick', 'up', 'also', 'little', 'bout', 'instant', 'amnesia', 'tough', 'believe', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'overall', 'story.Did', 'enjoy', 'Sure', 'better', 'Shield', 'HBO', 'Wire', 'No', 'not', 'really', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'considering', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'think', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'see', 'how', 'Bauer', 'character', 'turn', 'darker', 'psychological', 'territory', 'think', ""'m"", 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'next', 'assignment', 'out']",24: Season 1
599769,A9PRK90A8BTAI,B00005JLF2,"Patrick ""lakesideman1""","[0, 2]","For the better part of the last six years I have heard people talking about ""24"" at work but had never watched it myself.  Then two things happened, I got day 1 on DVD as a Christmas gift and I started watching day 7 on TV and was hooked almost immediately, which forced me to crack open my gift and dig in.First off the concept of telling the story in real time is magnificent.  What an idea by the writers who created this series.  The concept does lead to some moments of down time to allow for travel and so on and that leads to some plot threads that may not be exciting as the others...but as a whole it was gripping television.Kiefer Sutherland is brilliant as Jack Bauer.  A patriotic man who had plenty of faults and is willing to do almost anything to accomplish his mission even if it skirts breaking the law himself.  I found it compelling to think about, especially in this day and age...how far is too far?  and when does the end not justify the means?The story was a rollercoaster!  By the time the Drazens entered the scene, I felt as if I had been pulled through enough drama for three regular TV shows.  People you think are important at the beginning suddenly are gone without explanation (the parachuting plane wrecker!) and nobody is quite what you expect them to be.The Nina Myers character and plot thread was magnificent!  I almost fell off my chair when it was revealed that she was talking to Victor Drazen.The escapades of Terri and Kim started to wear a little thin as the day went on but it never got to be too distracting.  Sherri Palmer is deliciouosly rotten.Dennis Hopper was great as Drazen, when he shoots the daughter of his friend in the head to get Jack under control I was speechless.  The only problem I had was that the climax of the day seemed rushed.  Victor was sure that Jack would come to him for revenge and the best plan that he had was to run out the back door and try to get away on an exposed dock with Jack on his tail...hardly a criminal mastermind.Then when you think it's over and you go to take a breath...Nina is not working for the Drazens but someone else entirely!The DVD edition I got as a gift had an alternate ending in which Teri lives.  I for one like the original ending, not because I want to see a family ripped apart but rather because it seems a fitting climax gravity wise for the worst day in Jack's life.  The happily ever after ending seemed too contrived and Teri's death gives Nina some weight as a villian.All in all a great thrill ride, I watched it all in three days.

599770,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00005JLF2,Patrick L. Randall,"[5, 7]","RELENTLESS!  If there is one word that can describe what watching ""24"" is like, it's relentless.  There are few TV shows on the air today or that have aired throughout history that have the ambition to try what ""24"" tried and the skill to pull it off so seamlessly.  For those who have been living under a rock for the past two years, Season 1 of ""24"" tells the real time story of the events surrounding an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate.  The caveat is that this is no ordinary candidate.  David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) is the first African-American candidate with a legitimate chance to win the White House.  His potential presidency is of paramount importance to the country.  His assassination would prove disastrous.  To compromise Palmer's security, the terrorists have managed to infiltrate Los Angeles Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU) on the day of the California primary.  The security breach allows the terrorists access the man whose responsibility is to weed out the terrorist threats and keep Palmer alive, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland).  The terrorists kidnap his family and keep Jack jumping through hoops in a dual-pronged effort to save his family and protect Palmer.  All of this occurs over the course of one 24-hour period.  It's the longest day of Jack Bauer's life.The concept of ""24"" seemed very difficult to buy into at first.  As a result, I did not watch any of Season 1 when it was broadcast and have not watched any of Season 2 so far.  Yet, glowing reviews and recommendations led me to get this DVD collection and watch it from start to finish.  It is an incredibly well-produced and well-acted show.  Most big-budget movies are not as well-crafted as ""24"".  The concept of telling the story in real time presents many difficulties and is rarely attempted as a thematic device (see 1995's Johnny Depp movie ""Nick of Time"" for a big screen example of this device).  It does add to the suspense and drama, however, because every event must happen in a realistic time period.  For example, you couldn't very well have a character hop in a vehicle one side of Los Angeles and be completely on the other side by the time a commercial break is over.  So, even the smallest of details, like a long red light, play a major role in impacting all developments in this ongoing story.  The production team for ""24"" doesn't miss a trick, though.  The real time element is kept as honest as possible and not one single episode feels as though it's filler that is just using time to get from one point of the plot to the other.Excellent storytelling and tight plotting aside, ""24"" would not be able to work if it were not for the outstanding performances of a highly skilled cast.  Kiefer Sutherland is the most well-known of all the actors and he brings his own special brand of harried desperation to the role of Jack Bauer.  Sutherland is the perfect actor for this role because he brings the perfect blend of sympathy and uncertainty to his role.  The audience truly feels for Bauer as he deals with the events of this day, but they also feel on edge because they don't know how far over the line he is willing to go to achieve his objective (he shoots one of his superiors in the leg with a tranquilizer in the first episode just to get some withheld information from him.  Haysbert brings a true sense of presidential bearing to his role as Senator Palmer.  He's a good man that the audience can easily believe is presidential material.  (Heck if David Palmer were a real candidate, I'd vote for him).  Leslie Hope (Teri Bauer) and Elisha Cuthbert(Kim Bauer) demonstrate the appropriate level of terror one would espect them to feel as the captured wife and daughter of Jack Bauer, respective.  Sarah Clarke is also quite good as Jack's second in command at CTU, Nina Meyers.  Even smaller players like Tony Almeida (played by Carlos Bernard) and George Mason (played by skilled character actor Xander Berkeley) provided added weight to the already strong story.It's important in this review not to reveal any of the twists and turns that take place throughout the 24 hours.  If you haven't seen the show yet (as I hadn't before seeing it on DVD), the story developments will blow you away.  ""24"" is truly a masterful piece of work and I cannot wait until Season 2 is available so I can watch that from start to finish, too",5,"One of the most inventive, incredible series on television",1050883200,"04 21, 2003",2003,4361,"['RELENTLESS', 'one', 'word', 'can', 'describe', 'what', 'watching', '24', 'relentless', 'are', 'few', 'TV', 'shows', 'air', 'today', 'have', 'aired', 'history', 'have', 'ambition', 'try', 'what', '24', 'tried', 'skill', 'pull', 'off', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'Season', '1', '24', 'real', 'time', 'story', 'events', 'surrounding', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'caveat', 'ordinary', 'candidate', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'first', 'African-American', 'candidate', 'legitimate', 'chance', 'win', 'White', 'House', 'potential', 'presidency', 'paramount', 'importance', 'country', 'assassination', 'would', 'prove', 'disastrous', 'compromise', 'Palmer', 'security', 'terrorists', 'have', 'managed', 'infiltrate', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Counter-Terrorism', 'Unit', 'CTU', 'day', 'California', 'primary', 'security', 'breach', 'terrorists', 'access', 'man', 'responsibility', 'weed', 'out', 'terrorist', 'threats', 'keep', 'Palmer', 'alive', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'terrorists', 'kidnap', 'family', 'keep', 'Jack', 'jumping', 'hoops', 'dual-pronged', 'effort', 'save', 'family', 'protect', 'Palmer', 'course', 'one', '24-hour', 'period', 'longest', 'day', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'life.The', 'concept', '24', 'seemed', 'very', 'difficult', 'buy', 'first', 'result', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'Season', '1', 'when', 'was', 'broadcast', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'Season', '2', 'so', 'far', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'recommendations', 'led', 'get', 'DVD', 'collection', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'incredibly', 'well-produced', 'well-acted', 'show', 'Most', 'big-budget', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'well-crafted', '24', 'concept', 'telling', 'story', 'real', 'time', 'presents', 'many', 'difficulties', 'rarely', 'attempted', 'thematic', 'device', 'see', '1995', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'movie', 'Nick', 'Time', 'big', 'screen', 'example', 'device', 'add', 'suspense', 'drama', 'however', 'event', 'must', 'happen', 'realistic', 'time', 'period', 'example', 'could', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'have', 'character', 'hop', 'vehicle', 'one', 'side', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'be', 'completely', 'other', 'side', 'time', 'commercial', 'break', 'So', 'even', 'smallest', 'details', 'long', 'red', 'light', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'impacting', 'developments', 'ongoing', 'story', 'production', 'team', '24', ""n't"", 'miss', 'trick', 'though', 'real', 'time', 'element', 'kept', 'as', 'honest', 'possible', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'episode', 'feels', 'filler', 'just', 'using', 'time', 'get', 'one', 'point', 'plot', 'other.Excellent', 'storytelling', 'tight', 'plotting', 'aside', '24', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'work', 'were', 'not', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'highly', 'skilled', 'cast', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'most', 'well-known', 'actors', 'own', 'special', 'brand', 'harried', 'desperation', 'role', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Sutherland', 'perfect', 'actor', 'role', 'perfect', 'blend', 'sympathy', 'uncertainty', 'role', 'audience', 'truly', 'feels', 'Bauer', 'events', 'day', 'also', 'feel', 'edge', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'far', 'line', 'willing', 'go', 'achieve', 'objective', 'one', 'superiors', 'leg', 'tranquilizer', 'first', 'episode', 'just', 'get', 'withheld', 'information', 'Haysbert', 'true', 'sense', 'presidential', 'bearing', 'role', 'Senator', 'Palmer', 'good', 'man', 'audience', 'can', 'easily', 'believe', 'presidential', 'material', 'Heck', 'David', 'Palmer', 'were', 'real', 'candidate', ""'d"", 'vote', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'Teri', 'Bauer', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'demonstrate', 'appropriate', 'level', 'terror', 'one', 'would', 'espect', 'feel', 'captured', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'respective', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Jack', 'second', 'command', 'CTU', 'Nina', 'Meyers', 'Even', 'smaller', 'players', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'played', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'George', 'Mason', 'played', 'skilled', 'character', 'actor', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'provided', 'added', 'weight', 'already', 'strong', 'story.It', 'important', 'review', 'not', 'reveal', 'twists', 'take', 'place', '24', 'hours', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'yet', 'had', ""n't"", 'before', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'story', 'developments', 'will', 'blow', 'away', '24', 'truly', 'masterful', 'piece', 'work', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'Season', '2', 'available', 'can', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'too']",24: Season 1

599785,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00005JLF2,P Magnum,"[6, 6]","When 24 premiered on Fox in 2001, the hook of the show was that each episode represented one hour in the day of the presidential primary in California.  Each episode opens by telling you the hour that is taking place and that the events are in real time.  This is, of course, is a radical new concept for tv, which usually speeds up time for the sake of a story line.  But a format can only get you so far.  A show must be entertaining to hold your attention and 24 is extremely entertaining.  The show is a literal rollercoaster ride.  Kiefer Sutherland stars as Jack Bauer who works for the Los Angeles based counter terrorism unit of the federal government.  Dennis Haysbert is David Palmer, an African American senator who has a real shot at winning a presidential nomination.  It has been discovered that an extremely credible assassination attempt will be made on his life that day.  Jack is put in charge of finding out who is behind the attempt and to stop it.  He is also advised that the people behind the attempt include dirty agents within the organization.  In addition to all of this his daughter and then wife are kidnapped.  The tension is high as Jack struggles to unearth the plot against Palmer, save his family and even himself.  A clock shows up every now and then (usually where there is a commercial break and then when the show would comeback from the break) to keep you up-to-date on the timing.  The show also breaks the screen down into sections at times, so you can see what's happen to several characters at once in order to keep the show in real time. Each episode picks up where the last one ended, there are no flashbacks or recaps.  There are times when the show does ask you to suspend reality for a bit, but basically it is completely believable.  You do lose some of the cliffhanger feeling of the original run of the series as you don't have to wait a week in between shows, but the DVD retains the exciting, high quality drama, superb acting (especially by Mr. Sutherland) that earned 24 high praise and several Emmy Awards.",5,One Thrilling Day,1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,2062,"['When', '24', 'premiered', 'Fox', '2001', 'hook', 'show', 'was', 'episode', 'represented', 'one', 'hour', 'day', 'presidential', 'primary', 'California', 'episode', 'telling', 'hour', 'taking', 'place', 'events', 'are', 'real', 'time', 'course', 'radical', 'new', 'concept', 'tv', 'usually', 'up', 'time', 'sake', 'story', 'line', 'format', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'so', 'far', 'show', 'must', 'be', 'entertaining', 'hold', 'attention', '24', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'show', 'literal', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'who', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'based', 'counter', 'terrorism', 'unit', 'federal', 'government', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'David', 'Palmer', 'African', 'American', 'senator', 'who', 'real', 'shot', 'winning', 'presidential', 'nomination', 'been', 'discovered', 'extremely', 'credible', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'life', 'day', 'Jack', 'put', 'charge', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'attempt', 'stop', 'also', 'advised', 'people', 'attempt', 'include', 'dirty', 'agents', 'organization', 'addition', 'daughter', 'then', 'wife', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'tension', 'high', 'Jack', 'unearth', 'plot', 'Palmer', 'save', 'family', 'even', 'clock', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'usually', 'where', 'commercial', 'break', 'then', 'when', 'show', 'would', 'comeback', 'break', 'keep', 'up-to-date', 'timing', 'show', 'also', 'screen', 'down', 'sections', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'happen', 'several', 'characters', 'once', 'order', 'keep', 'show', 'real', 'time', 'episode', 'up', 'where', 'last', 'one', 'ended', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'recaps', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'show', 'ask', 'suspend', 'reality', 'bit', 'basically', 'completely', 'believable', 'do', 'lose', 'cliffhanger', 'feeling', 'original', 'run', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'week', 'shows', 'DVD', 'exciting', 'high', 'quality', 'drama', 'superb', 'acting', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Sutherland', 'earned', '24', 'high', 'praise', 'several', 'Emmy', 'Awards']",24: Season 1

However, what I received is a stripped down ""drama"" that is driven more by its own premise [24 hours IN REAL TIME!] than any sensible plot line.After the first few episodes aroused my curiosity,I found the experience of watching subsequent episodes annoying. The business about who on the inside is ""dirty"" was played around and around from every angle.  Then, implausible events are scripted so more instant drama can be injected.  Like leaving the captureded ""dirty"" one unattended with a cell phone.  What?  And the inclusion of the seriously overwrought Palmer, Democratic presidential candidate, and his hyper-absorbtion in his son's possible wrongdoing -- takes up way, way too much of the story line.  In fact, if you start stripping away the filler in this series, you end up with something that could be told in 2 hours as opposed to 24.This is the rare series that was probably more palatable with commercial interruptions in between so you could have a respite from the unrelenting hype-fear-tension-OH NO WHAT'S NEXT rigid atmosphere of this very unoriginal story.

Schneider,"[6, 8]","Fox's brilliant 24 is original, intelligent with edge-of-your-seat knockout suspense and thrilling action sequences--plus brilliant casting. Kiefer Sutherland, in easily the best role of his 17-year career as weary but determined federal agent Jack Bauer, gives a tour-de-force performance.  His Jack Bauer is someone with whom we instantly identify; however, he is nonetheless stronger, more patient, more resilient than are most of us, and certainly goes through what can only be described as a 24-hour personal and political nightmare of the highest order.Dennis Haysbert plays Senator Palmer, attempting to claim the historical distinction of being the first African-American to become President of the United States, and his performance is both powerful and compelling. The danger he faces on two fronts (the assassination conspiracy & his broken home life) is overwhelming, yet somehow believable, and adds to the sense of immediacy we feel while watching.  The other supporting characters are all well-cast and well-played.In television history, 24 goes down in TV history with such legendary series as THE FUGITIVE and RICH MAN, POOR MAN.  This will be remembered as a watershed in our time, as well as the diamond in the middle of the usual television network roughage in the year 2002.

599811,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLF2,Robert Moore,"[7, 7]","The idea behind 24 was one of the best in the history of television -- that of having a single season take place in real time over the course of 24 hours, each episode representing one hour of the ordeal -- but that would have been meaningless had the show not been done so superbly well.  24 was probably the most innovative show in what in retrospect has to be one of the great seasons in the history of television.  Today, with television tremendously harmed by the ubiquitous reality shows, scripted TV--especially scripted TV with long story arcs--has suffered a tremendous decline.  But in the 2001-2002 television season we had such stellar shows as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, 24, ANGEL, FARSCAPE, ALIAS, THE SOPRANOS, THE WEST WING, and DARK ANGEL all showing at once.  Contrast that to the fall 2004 season, where I have been tempted to watch only two shows:  the last half of the 2004 season of DEAD LIKE ME and the stellar new series LOST, created by ALIAS creator J. J. Abrams.24 was great when it came out, but it is much better to watch it on DVD.  There is something inherently unsettling about a story that is supposed to take place in 24 hours, but which gradually unfolds on television over the course of nine months.  Ideally one would watch all twenty-four episodes straight through (I'm sure someone, somewhere has done that), but doing so over the course of several evenings is a vast improvement over the original.  Indeed, I think that the widespread availability of television shows on DVD has done more to enhance the appreciation for quality TV and for the enjoyment of its strengths (namely, narrative, something that television does vastly better than the movies, for the simple reason that it has narrative space that movies, with their two hour limit, will always suffer from).  To use an imperfect metaphor, movies are short stories; television at its best (as in BUFFY or 24) can be a novel.  Being able to watch the show without commercials also does a great deal to improve the experience.  I am very near the position that commercials are not merely a necessary evil, but merely evil.  But that is a different debate (scan my other reviews for that hobby horse).The cast is good but inconsistent.  I'm not sure quite what happened, but some of the actors are absolutely perfect for the show, others are not quite up to their level.  First and foremost, you have to recognize the brilliance of the two main performers, Kiefer Sutherland and Dennis Haysbert.  Sutherland in particular was a revelation.  We had seen him in a host of shows and movies over the years, and while often a strong presences, especially when playing heavies (my first memory of him was as one of the punk older kids in STAND BY ME), nothing had every indicated that he could take an entire series on his shoulders and make it work.  He is so superb as Jack Bauer that it is simply impossible to imagine anyone else playing the character.  Dennis Haysbert as Sen. David Palmer was so good in his role as to be shocking.  To be honest, when I first saw him, he was one of these actors who seems vaguely familiar, but when you check his resume you can remember having been in a host of shows and films.  For instance, he played the voodoo-using Pedro Cerrano in the MAJOR LEAGUE films (I seem to remember a scene where guys on the team are trying to find a chicken to sacrifice in order to bless his bats).  At the same time he was doing the first season of 24 he was also filming the exceptionally fine film FAR FROM HEAVEN, in which he was very memorable.  Sutherland and Haysbert give the show its backbone, and they jointly give it a strength it might not otherwise have possessed.  There are a host of other strong performances as well, but I've been impressed in talking with a number of friends at how unimpressive some are by some of the other performers.  I'm still not certain how I feel about Sarah Clarke as Nina.  In part, this is not entirely her fault.  Unlike the other performers, she constantly has to play two roles; her actual character, and the role that her character is playing.  If you rewatch a lot of episodes, it is clear that the directors cheat a bit by deflecting suspicion from her character.  Her true nature is hidden a bit too well, clearly so that there would be a big shock in the final episode (though there is, of course, a hint in the opening voiceovers for most of the episodes), but I'm not convinced that they played fair with her in Season One.  I'm also not too thrilled with Elisa Cuthbert as Jack's daughter Kim.  I am not maintaining that these people were necessarily bad, merely that I'm not sure they did as good a job of casting with them as they might have.  Luckily Sutherland and Haysbert, the two who actually need to be outstanding, actually are outstanding.  I should also note that Penny Johnson, whom I had primarily known previously from STAR TREK:  DEEP SPACE NINE, is appropriately reprehensible as Palmer's power-obsessed wife.  Dennis Hopper does his usual turn as a bad guy, though I have to say that at this point I find him a bit overused in such roles.  He is a great actor, but I would rather see him do other things.There are some minor criticisms that one could make.  The way that Kim keeps getting into trouble over and over and over strains credulity.  The fact that no one seems to be suffering from severe sleep deprivation seems a bit improbable.  The way they use the satellites near the beginning of the show to track Jack Bauer's path makes you wonder why they don't do the same thing on innumerable occasions later in the season is troubling.  But all in all this are trivial complaints.  All in all, this is a riveting season of television with at least two superb performances, a lot of tension, and a lot of thrills.  One can only hope that this kind of television, and not the seemingly endless reality shows, is the future of the medium.",5,Fascinating premise and absolutely stellar execution,1099785600,"11 7,

599812,A3DTZHAJ5CW739,B00005JLF2,"Roberto Lagos ""roblagos""","[0, 4]","""24"" es la mejor serie de accion de la television actual, y de las mejores de todos los tiempos. El formato de tiempo real -muy escazamente utilizado en el cine- es llevado con exito a la television, que se centra en la crisis que abarca exactamente 24 horas en la vida de Jack Bauer- un Kiefer Sutherland en su mejor momento y me temo felizmente ya felizmente encasillado en tan fabuloso personaje- quien acude a todo tipo de maniobras generalmente violentas, al margen de la ley para lograr su proposito, sin importar los costos humanos y medios.Esta vez, en su temporada inagural, Jack se encuentra atrapado entre el rapto de su adolescente hija Kim y un complejo plan para asesinar a un popular senador norteamericano.Ademas, Jack estara a merced de posibles traidores dentro de su propia arma, la CTU-Unidad de Contra Terrorismo.La adrenalina correra a borbotones en el cuerpo de todos los involucrados, mientras Jack tratara de demostrar su inocencia, salvar a su familia, proteger al senador, descubrir a los traidores, y cazar a los complotadores. Dejando de lado toda la moralina sobre si es correcto o no el proceder de Jack, la serie es altamente recomendable, imprecindible para la gente que gusta de una violencia mas intensa, ""realista"" (nada de pistoleros de fantasia, con pistolas que nunca se quedan sin sus balas magicas), las tramas inteligentes que tienen mas giros que una monta&ntilde;a rusa y llenas de cliffhangers como una excelente serial antigua, y los contiunos sobresaltos frente al televisor, sin olvidar a estos personajes bien delineados, sean heroes o villanos, mas grandes que la vida misma.Nunca he visto la serie en sus emisiones semanales en la tv, y me fui de frente a los dvds. La presentacion de la caja con los 6 DVDs -que contiene los 24 episodios excelentemente grabados- es muy atractiva (super fotos de los protagonistas) y viene acompa&ntilde;ada de un booklet que detalla la trama hora a hora, a manera de guia para no perderse.

Unfortunately for Bauer, stopping this plot becomes more complicated when his own family is placed in danger.  There are a lot of nifty little things to like about the show (including it's usage of split screen effects during key sequences, cliffhangers that make you want to see what happens next), and all of it is balanced out by strong performances from the cast, and some really shocking turnabouts that are dripping over with tension.

I confess that I missed several episodes last year of the series so it was great for me to watch the episodes that I hadn't watched as well as to rewatch the episodes I had.24 plays out exactly like a good book, ending with a cliffhanger in every single episode leaving you desperate for more! Good thing is, with the first season on DVD you can watch them one after one, not having to wait a whole week like last year when it was on TV.I know that I watched several episodes one right after the other over and over, making 24 play like a REALLY long movie!Another great thing about having the first season on DVD is that there are no commercials meaning, where as each episode used to run for a hour, now they only run for about 40 minutes, meaning you can watch more without the annoying advertisements!Another good thing is that the entire season on DVD is presented in anamophoric widescreen, making it really like a movie!The &quot;Special Features&quot; are a two-minute alternate ending with optional commentary and a one-minute season one introduction by Kiefer Sutherland.

But, let me tell you, each episode leaves you hanging. To watch this on DVD is much better then waiting a week in between episodes. I spent one whole day watching them, fighting sleep and hunger. I thought I was crazy until I heard other people's ideas on the series. And, I realized I wasnt the only one. Unfortunately, for me, I work nights so I can't see the TV series during it's time slot. But, thankfully, the DVDs are available.There are so many twist and turns that Jack's 24 hours become your twenty-four hours.Seriously, this is some of the most amazing television I have ever seen. You will love this! And, not to give away the ending, it's fantastic! You will not believe it.So, buy season one and two together so you won't be dying to find out what happens.

Never has gut-wrenching terror been so much fun.The plot is the same CIA/political assassination/family in danger hugger-mugger we've all seen a thousand times before. The difference here is the beautiful execution. Few feature films have been so unnerringly directed for maximum suspense. The writers somehow manage to make most of this super-plotty intrigue spring from their surprisingly complex characters. Despite the real-time, the drama comes from choices as much as logistics.It's also amazingly sustained. Though the series takes a slight breather after episode 13, the thickening plot and solid characterizations keep it addictive. Only in the final three hours does 24 run out of gas, as Dennis Hopper's direct-to-video Serbian accent signals a descent into standard action flick silliness that includes a misguided repitition of the done to death family-in-danger bit, a 'shocking' final twist that makes little sense and does nothing for the story, and a tragic ending made to somehow seem irrelevant to everything else going on.But, why quibble?

That was my first mistake.  My second mistake was to continue watching nearly all of season 1.  Nearing the end, the only thing worth looking forward to were the plot holes large enough to drive a bullet proof limo through.As bad as the plot holes was the inexplicable and condescending moralizing.  When Jack tells hostage-taker Rick, as he's hiding in a water tower loading his gun, that ""the first way to get a second chance is to take responsibility,"" I almost lost it.  Later, when Kim is at Rick's house, against her will, she asks Rick why he doesn't want more from his life.  He says he's had a rough childhood.  She tells him that that's no excuse because ""she has a friend who spent years in foster homes and now has a scholarship to Stanford.""  Oh my God.  That time I did lose it.  I didn't know that the Bauer clan was not only involved in serious terrorist trouble, they also work part time for Dr. Phil and Hallmark.  By the way, Kim, you were the one who sneaked out of the house to do drugs with anonymous college boys.  Maybe you should have been studying for your SATs before telling someone else how to live their life?I kept hoping Jack's family would be shot by what turns out to be the most inept terrorists known to Man so I could counsel him with my armchair Buddhism - ""Jack, you know that attachment is the root cause of suffering.  One must let go of attachments in order to be free from said suffering.  I had a friend once who spent time in foster homes and now he's at Stanford, free from attachment and as such, no longer suffers from the ignorance that once dictated his existence.""On a hunch, I looked up the creator of the show, Joel Surnow because I was raised with this deluded morality.  Sure enough, Mr. Surnow is one of Hollywood's rare conservatives.  I am aware that the ""this is how the world SHOULD be and this is what people NEED to do"" morality is not unique to conservatives.  But I played that hunch and it panned out.Had the show closed the plot holes, left the patronizing life messages out of the script, and employed decent actors, perhaps 24 would have stood a chance.

Jack is in search of his missing teenage daughter, who might be kidnapped. The two other stories center on a presidential candidate David Palmer, who is having troubles with his family about an incident that occur 7 yrs ago. The third story is primarily the CTU center helping Bauer on his investigation. it is very difficult to explain the TV show in a couple of paragraphs with out ruining details; but one thing is for certain that this is probably the most original, effective and realistic show on TV. It left me glued to the TV set until the last episode.so if you are a fan of shows like Prison Break, C.S.I, The Shield and Law And Order or any action movie than this is definitely gona make your day, your best 24 hours of your life sitting in front of T.V. so don't hesitate, BUY IT NOW!!.Special FeaturesDisc 6: Alternate EndingAlternate Ending with Commentary By Producer & Creator Joel SurnowSeason One Introduction by Keifer SutherlandWidescreen 1:77:1Dolby 5.1 Surround",5,The Clock Is Ticking,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,1600,"['WOW', 'what', 'said', 'when', 'i', 'finished', 'watching', '24', 'episodes', 'exhilarating', 'show', 'must', 'admit', 'one', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'TV', 'there', 'line', 'minute', 'felt', 'real', 'life', 'situation.For', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'setting', 'program', 'worry', 'not', 'complicated', 'show', '12:00AM', 'last', 'episode', 'end', '12:00am', 'course', '24', 'hours', 'go', 'events', '3', 'different', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'real', 'time', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'first', 'story', 'head', 'CTU', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Jack', 'search', 'missing', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'kidnapped', 'two', 'other', 'stories', 'center', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'David', 'Palmer', 'who', 'having', 'troubles', 'family', 'incident', '7', 'yrs', 'ago', 'third', 'story', 'primarily', 'CTU', 'center', 'helping', 'Bauer', 'investigation', 'very', 'difficult', 'explain', 'TV', 'show', 'couple', 'paragraphs', 'out', 'ruining', 'details', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'probably', 'most', 'original', 'effective', 'realistic', 'show', 'TV', 'left', 'glued', 'TV', 'set', 'last', 'episode.so', 'are', 'fan', 'shows', 'Prison', 'Break', 'C.S.I', 'Shield', 'Law', 'Order', 'action', 'movie', 'definitely', 'gona', 'make', 'day', 'best', '24', 'hours', 'life', 'sitting', 'front', 'T.V', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'BUY', 'IT', 'NOW', '.Special', 'FeaturesDisc', '6', 'Alternate', 'EndingAlternate', 'Ending', 'Commentary', 'Producer', 'Creator', 'Joel', 'SurnowSeason', 'One', 'Introduction', 'Keifer', 'SutherlandWidescreen', '1:77:1Dolby', '5.1', 'Surround']",24: Season 1

The wildly popular series ""24"" is an entertaining show marred by a streak of misogyny that can't be ignored.  I proudly count myself among the ever-growing number of neo-feminists who are trying to fight the man (quite literally).I'm not going to spoil the plot for those who haven't seen the show (unlike many of the reviews found here, shame on you all).  But the truth is, without exception, the primary female characters -- Jack's wife, Jack's daughter, and Jack's co-worker Nina, and Palmer's wife -- are all portrayed as either clueless, heartless, helpless, or worse.  On the other hand, the male characters do the decision-making.  They are shown as unwavering in their conviction to ""do the right thing.""  The male characters - mostly Jack and Palmer - are the barometers of virtue.  It's all rather unsettling in this day and age - especially since no one (but me) seems willing to point it out.If you can get past that (as millions have), the show is admittedly pretty entertaining.  The plot devices show a lack of inspiration sometimes in the second half of this first season, ideas get repeated.  The casting of Dennis Hopper in a significant role was a poor one, as Mr. Hopper chews the scenery unrelentingly - sticking out like a sore thumb amidst the rather subtle work of the rest of the cast.Proceed with caution if you have any respect for the fairer sex.",3,Latent misogyny ruins potentially great show,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,1421,"['Okay', 'folks', 'time', 'someone', 'said', 'wildly', 'popular', 'series', '24', 'entertaining', 'show', 'marred', 'streak', 'misogyny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'proudly', 'count', 'ever-growing', 'number', 'neo-feminists', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'fight', 'man', 'quite', 'literally', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'plot', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'many', 'reviews', 'found', 'here', 'shame', 'truth', 'exception', 'primary', 'female', 'characters', 'Jack', 'wife', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'Jack', 'co-worker', 'Nina', 'Palmer', 'wife', 'are', 'portrayed', 'clueless', 'heartless', 'helpless', 'worse', 'other', 'hand', 'male', 'characters', 'do', 'decision-making', 'are', 'shown', 'unwavering', 'conviction', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'male', 'characters', 'mostly', 'Jack', 'Palmer', 'are', 'barometers', 'virtue', 'rather', 'unsettling', 'day', 'age', 'especially', 'one', 'willing', 'point', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'millions', 'have', 'show', 'admittedly', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'devices', 'show', 'lack', 'inspiration', 'sometimes', 'second', 'half', 'first', 'season', 'ideas', 'get', 'repeated', 'casting', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'significant', 'role', 'was', 'poor', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Hopper', 'scenery', 'unrelentingly', 'sticking', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'rather', 'subtle', 'work', 'rest', 'cast.Proceed', 'caution', 'have', 'respect', 'fairer', 'sex']",24: Season 1

599860,A3VCFKG8PVV0CO,B00005JLF2,Stingray Ramone,"[33, 35]","I have always liked FOX's ambitious and inventive spirit as a network, competing against the big three giants of the television industry: CBS, ABC, and NBC.  Some of the network's show ideas have gone under, but 24 defies convention, as it never fails to deliver suspense each hour.  Give 24 a quick look and you are hooked to the very end.  Despite some rather corny, cookie-cutter moments (i.e. Teri Bauer's stint with amnesia), 24 is an intelligent, original, and fresh thrill ride of a show.Season 1 of 24, dubbed as ""The Longest Day"" ranges from 12:00am to 12:00am, the full day of the presidential primary in Los Angeles.  The story revolves around two men: Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), an African-American presidential candidate, who is the target of assassination on that day, and CTU (CounterTerrorist Unit) agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), the man whose mission is to protect Palmer and thwart the terrorists behind the plot of achieving their goal.  However, Bauer's mission has become personal. His daughter, Kim and eventually his wife, Teri are kidnapped and they, along with Bauer, are also targeted by the very same people threatening Palmer. But why? You would have to see how this plot unravels.  To make matters harder, some of the people Jack works with at CTU, are working for the terrorists.  Jack has the arduous task to protect Palmer and save his family, while having the right frame of mind on who to trust and not to trust in his mission to realize both his aims.24 is wonderfully crafted and complicated that demands the viewer to watch its episode carefully, because of its meticulous real-time format.  The pulse-pounding suspense can let up at certain points, but the transition scenes, whether it would be a shocking development or a pivotal juncture, kicks up the suspense a notch higher.  But what makes 24 so effective is the superb acting of Kiefer Sutherland, who is in a word, masterful as Jack Bauer.  He portrays Bauer as the gritty consummate professional, who would do just about anything to get the job done, even if it means walking the fine line of good and evil.  At the same time, Sutherland elicits sympathy as a family man, with the desperation of a second crack at family togetherness.  Haysbert pulls out a tremendous performance as Senator Palmer, an honorable and honest politician who believes in upholding the righteous ideals of American democracy.  Worthy of mention is Penny Johnson Jerald, who plays Sherry Palmer, David's wife, a conniving, greedy woman, wanting nothing more than the power and popularity of being the First Lady.  The two Bauer women, Teri, played by Leslie Hope and Kim, portrayed by the eye-catching Elisha Cuthbert, are solid in dealing with the unpredictability of their days.  Nina Myers, played by the sultry Sarah Clarke, is impressive as Bauer's reasonably trustworthy secretary, with something up her sleeve.  The rest of the supporting cast, from top to bottom are also wonderful.In my opinion, the first season of 24 is slightly better than its successive second season because it is more unpredictable and provides higher shock value.  For those who have not seen 24 in its entirety, it is best not to reveal the story and its highly detailed events in greater detail.

I noticed that there was a hair or some sort of fiber for the entirety of one camera shot in the first episode.  I'm sure experts could spot more.Sound: 4/5The sound is great and really comes out in a nice audio system with subwoofers, but it's merely stereo and wasn't enhanced with 5.1 surround.Extras: 1/5I thought the packaging was nice when it first arrived, with an unfolding booklet with a portrait of six of the characters showing through a transparent disc holder.  Then I couldn't close it one day.  The disc holders are fastened down with only rubber glue!  I had to peel it off and restick it down.  I can only hope that it doesn't fall out of place again.  As for extra features, well, there pretty much are none.  I couldn't find the so-called season two teaser trailer as listed on Amazon and the outer packaging, so I'm assuming it's part of Kiefer's season one introduction, where he basically only says that season two will be even better.  What's worse, they put the introduction on the last disc!  Please enjoy season one, now take the last disc out, don't watch the last four hours yet or you'll spoil everything, and then put the first disc in, please.I won't talk much about the plotlines and the quality of the show.  It's just one of my favorite shows of all time.  I only have one complaint about the actual show, and I'm sure other fans will know.  They should've made someone else the mole at the end.  It just didn't fit with the rest of the show.The ""previously on 24"" bits that you see between the show logo and the start of the episode aren't in this set.  Even though what happened in the previous episode would be obvious and redundant to a home viewer with a box set, it's still a part of the show.  The recaps were stylishly done as well, keeping you refreshed on who the characters are and what's going on if you're a bit lost.  The worst thing about these parts missing is that sometimes, you notice that the score has already started at the episode beginnings, and seems like the beginning of the score is missing and chopped off.  The composer scored the entirety of what was aired, not just the relevant new footage of the episodes.For such a great series with its loyal following, it is a travesty that hardly anything was done for this box set release.  I would've liked to see a feature where you can listen to the score by itself.  Cast biographies should be on every DVD release.  Deleted scenes; I've heard that there was more footage to Mandy's scenes involving the airplane.  Outtakes.  Cast and crew interviews.  They could've put just fifteen minutes of extra footage in this set and I wouldn't complain, but they hardly did anything.My guess is that this DVD set was just a promotional tool to get people, curious about the buzz, into the show and watching the second season.  If the second season goes well, they might release a new first season set with everything we want, except charging at least [money] more than it is now.  If so, I hope they have a rebate for those who bought the original set.Overall, I guess it is your money's worth.  50 bucks for 24 hours minus commercials is a pretty good deal.  I've paid over a hundred for other sets that are only ten hours minus commercials.  It just could've been done a lot better.",3,"Great show despite a couple flaws, but the box set stinks!",1034726400,"10 16, 2002",2002,3353,"['Picture', 'quality', '4.5/5It', 'nice', 'crisp', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'noticed', 'was', 'hair', 'sort', 'fiber', 'entirety', 'one', 'camera', 'shot', 'first', 'episode', ""'m"", 'sure', 'experts', 'could', 'spot', 'more.Sound', '4/5The', 'sound', 'great', 'really', 'out', 'nice', 'audio', 'system', 'subwoofers', 'merely', 'stereo', 'was', ""n't"", 'enhanced', '5.1', 'surround.Extras', '1/5I', 'thought', 'packaging', 'was', 'nice', 'when', 'first', 'arrived', 'unfolding', 'booklet', 'portrait', 'six', 'characters', 'showing', 'transparent', 'disc', 'holder', 'Then', 'could', ""n't"", 'close', 'one', 'day', 'disc', 'holders', 'are', 'fastened', 'down', 'only', 'rubber', 'glue', 'had', 'peel', 'off', 'restick', 'down', 'can', 'only', 'hope', ""n't"", 'fall', 'place', 'again', 'extra', 'features', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'are', 'none', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'so-called', 'season', 'two', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'listed', 'Amazon', 'outer', 'packaging', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'part', 'Kiefer', 'season', 'one', 'introduction', 'where', 'basically', 'only', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'What', 'worse', 'put', 'introduction', 'last', 'disc', 'Please', 'enjoy', 'season', 'one', 'now', 'take', 'last', 'disc', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'last', 'four', 'hours', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'spoil', 'everything', 'then', 'put', 'first', 'disc', 'please.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'much', 'plotlines', 'quality', 'show', 'just', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'time', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'actual', 'show', ""'m"", 'sure', 'other', 'fans', 'will', 'know', 'should', ""'ve"", 'made', 'someone', 'else', 'mole', 'end', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'show.The', 'previously', '24', 'bits', 'see', 'show', 'logo', 'start', 'episode', 'are', ""n't"", 'set', 'Even', 'what', 'happened', 'previous', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'obvious', 'redundant', 'home', 'viewer', 'box', 'set', 'still', 'part', 'show', 'recaps', 'were', 'stylishly', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'refreshed', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'going', ""'re"", 'bit', 'lost', 'worst', 'thing', 'parts', 'missing', 'sometimes', 'notice', 'score', 'already', 'started', 'episode', 'beginnings', 'beginning', 'score', 'missing', 'chopped', 'off', 'composer', 'scored', 'entirety', 'what', 'was', 'aired', 'not', 'just', 'relevant', 'new', 'footage', 'episodes.For', 'such', 'great', 'series', 'loyal', 'following', 'travesty', 'hardly', 'anything', 'was', 'done', 'box', 'set', 'release', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'feature', 'where', 'can', 'listen', 'score', 'Cast', 'biographies', 'should', 'be', 'DVD', 'release', 'Deleted', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'was', 'more', 'footage', 'Mandy', 'scenes', 'involving', 'airplane', 'Outtakes', 'Cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'could', ""'ve"", 'put', 'just', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'set', 'would', ""n't"", 'complain', 'hardly', 'did', 'anything.My', 'guess', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'just', 'promotional', 'tool', 'get', 'people', 'curious', 'buzz', 'show', 'watching', 'second', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'well', 'might', 'release', 'new', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'everything', 'want', 'charging', 'least', '[', 'money', 'more', 'now', 'so', 'hope', 'have', 'rebate', 'who', 'bought', 'original', 'set.Overall', 'guess', 'money', 'worth', '50', 'bucks', '24', 'hours', 'minus', 'commercials', 'pretty', 'good', 'deal', ""'ve"", 'paid', 'hundred', 'other', 'sets', 'are', 'only', 'ten', 'hours', 'commercials', 'just', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'better']",24: Season 1

599895,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JLF2,trebe,"[0, 0]","With Kieffer Sutherland set to reprise his role at Jack Bauer in 24: Live Another Day, I decided to revisit the series, rewatching all eight seasons prior to the May 5, 2014 premiere.  Although over a dozen years have passed, with its ""real time"" format, the groundbreaking first season of 24 still remains a very engaging, exciting and impactful drama, establishing a mold for the seasons to come, and severing as an example for many other productions to follow.  Although there are a few slow spots, the focus is predominantly on action, as 24 is an extended thrill ride, rife with plot twists, and threats to the nation on a grand scale, involving players at the highest levels of government.  Heavy spoilers follow, so the uninitiated are forewarned.Premiering in the fall of 2001, 24 follows in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attack, as Jack Bauer, the head of the Los Angeles branch of CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) attempts to deal with a sophisticated plot to assassinate Presidential candidate David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert,The Unit), that also threatens the lives of Bauer's wife Teri (Leslie Hope), and daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert,The Girl Next Door).Utilizing satellite feeds and traffic cameras, CTU is an agency capable of great technical expertise, but with some very questionable security practices, CTU also suffers from incompetence, power plays, turf wars, and is frequently  infiltrated by terrorists, traitors, and moles.Facing devious opposition with plans in motion at several levels, and often hampered by staff with hidden motives, making progress is never easy for Bauer and CTU, as success is usually followed by complications, and another threat.  Even those who are loyal, are coerced into aiding terrorists, to save their loved ones.  With new players often appearing in the mix, emotions ebb and flow throughout the ""real time"" of each hourly episode, which typically concludes on a cliffhanger.  In a pattern that would be repeated, the story arc of Season One, is roughly divided into three acts.A youthful and blondish Kieffer Sutherland quickly establishes himself as Bauer, a caring husband and father, dedicated to his job.  Bauer's determination, explosively violent behavior, tolerance for pain, and propensity for employing intimidation and torture, would soon reshape primetime TV.24 features a tremendous supporting and guest cast, including Carlos Bernard, Sarah Clarke, Penny Johnson Jerald, Glenn Morshower, Mia Kirshner, Dennis Hopper, Jude Ciccolella, and Leslie Hope.  Rarely does an actor have the presence and statue to elevate a series, the way that Dennis Haysbert does as David Palmer.  The special relationship that develops between Haysbert and Sutherland, would continue to be one of the cornerstones of the series, into the second and third seasons.24 isn't always very credible, but it is extremely entertaining, and can easily be quite addictive.

599896,A9C375HSNCY9,B00005JLF2,Trevor Cotton,"[4, 4]","In my opinion 24 is the best show on TV by an absolute mile and the first season was the best of all.  Of course by now the concept is no longer original now there have been 4 series (though it still maintains it's excellent standards), but at the time this was an innovative formula.  There are so many twists and turns in the plot and almost every episode ends on a cliffhanger, though at times you have to suspend your disbelief it is amazing TV.  Obviously Kiefer Sutherland is fantastic as Jack Bauer, a role he has completely made his own, but all the actors involved are great, Carlos Bernard as a hostile towards Jack, Tony Almeida, is a great charachter who develops over the future series.  Sarah Clarke is Superb as Nina Myers as is Elisha Cuthbert as Kim Bauer, both these characters were central to the plot in the first series, whereas in future series they were perhaps unessential to the story.It truly is as great as everyone says, do believe the hype.  I actually missed the first series when it was on TV, however after watching half of the second series i went out and purchased it on DVD, and i was not dissapointed.  Though im sure most people know it by now, the ending is superb and very unexpected, i won't ruin it here in case you haven't seen it, but it is incredible.

To quote Homer Simpson: ""It means he gets results, you stupid Chief!"" There is no way anyone in real life would get away with half of the outrageous antics Bauer manages to pull off in just one hour. But that's what makes it so much fun to watch.""24"" is a terrific serial adventure. By no means is the writing devoid of plot holes, but as long as you suspend any resemblance of reality, it is incredibly fun to watch, as well as addictive. It's funny to me to think that, whereas ""24"" is an entire season of shows that follows one day and has been a success, the show ""Murder One"" followed one murder case for a season's worth of shows and was a ratings nightmare. Regardless, if you're anything like me and enjoy shows that don't follow the usual ""wrap it up in 44 minutes"" formula, you'll enjoy the first season of ""24.""I didn't start watching ""24"" until the most recent 4th season, which hooked me from the start. I decided to revisit the previous seasons. Having just completed this first season, I enjoyed it overall, but preferred the 4th. The storyline of having to protect Presidential Candidate Palmer was a good one, but was lost for the most part because of Bauer and his family. Granted, I haven't yet seen either seasons 2 or 3, but what I loved about 4 was the complete focus of Bauer on his assignment. Overall, I think the 4th, 24-hour mission was better because of the complete lack of any ridiculous dangers involving his daughter, Kim.If this is where you journey with ""24"" begins, then you'll have some good surprises in store.

The acting is sub par in spots and I really don't care what happens to the characters. The ""Kim"" storylines are dumb and distracting. The concept of ""real-time"" TV isn't that innovative if you ask me.

If you're a fan of the show, you'll be pleased to know that these sets look good, sound good, and have great extra features. That is, if you care. I bought seasons 1-5 at Costco last Christmas because they were on sale. I mean, who would want to miss out on the most intense, action packed show of all time? My girlfriend and I watched through season 4, but became totally burnt out with it. I never want to see another episode again, so I sold them on ebay and bought The Shield (a much better show...and that's a fact). 24 became stale because of the rigid subject matter, and repetitive situations. The show is about counter-terrorism, so there's no comedy (not that there should be) and no change in tone. 24 attempts to keep the same breakneck pace the entire season, which isn't dramatic (only superficial). It doesn't interest me and I don't buy it. At first we liked it but it quickly became apparent that 24 is fast on pacing, and sloooow on brains/logic. A lot of people disagree with me....hell, you're probably one of them. That's OK, because I've got better shows to watch like The X-Files, Millennium, The Sopranos, The Wire, Carnivale, Deadwood, Rome, The Shield, Stargate SG-1, Farscape, Lost, House M.D., Brotherhood, etc., etc. Check those shows out if you want the best that TV on DVD has to offer. If the plot holes and ridiculous stories don't bother you, then I say go for it and buy this set.If you want specific examples of the plot holes, you either haven't been watching or are as naive as the writers. There are too many to list (5 seasons worth). If you've been watching for any length of time at all you'll remember Air Force One being taken out in mid air, extravagant plans to assassinate a ""potential"" US presidential candidate (all they had to do was snipe him out), being able to travel to anywhere in LA in a matter of 5 minutes or less, etc. I mean, the concept of the same man having to save the entire planet 5+ times in a row is absurd, and that's what the show is based on. Come on! But they try to come off so real and authentic. I don't know....maybe I just don't get it; if you do...good for you. Either way it's just not for me.

""24"" makes for some seriously addictive TV because it offers something that's in painfully short supply in Hollywood, whether on the big or small screen: genuine suspense. I had sort of a vague feeling throughout that things would turn out for the best, but with people getting killed left and right it's obvious that no one's safe. The show's writers prove themselves to be masters at keeping the plot moving along while throwing so many surprises your way you'll probably give up trying to guess what's going to happen about halfway through. The next stunning twist or revelation is never far away, and you can rarely be sure who's good or bad. As the interwtined plots develop, they come to encompass a combination of international cloak-and-dagger workings, back-room political machinations, revenge plots, and family melodrama. Although ""24"" has plenty of bullets flying around, it's definitely not an action show.  Rather, it's a suspense show with action in it.  It's more about building tension, and showing how the tension effects the characters, than anything else.  Kiefer Sutherland gives an appropriately serious performance as Jack Bauer, the noble government agent who's trying to piece his family back together after the demands of his work has driven it apart. The supporting cast is mostly excellent as well, and the foreboding score helps crank up the already tense atmosphere.

He plays to the anti-hero in all of us, doing what he wants by his own rules, but still having his own code to follow. Topping it off is Dennis Haysbert as Senator David Palmer, who is going through a moral transformation of his own in his quest to become President of the United States. These three characters especially grip you in the heart-wrenching decisions they have to make (often in a matter of minutes) and the consequences that come as a result.These characters are supported by great performances by Carlos Bernard as Tony Almeda, Xander Berkeley as George Mason, and Penny Johnson Jerald as Sherry Palmer. Together, these six characters all explore the seemingly contradictory paths toward the same goal.However, other supporting characters of 24 almost negate the stellar performances of the cast. Leslie Hope as Terri Bauer, Elisha Cuthbert as Kim Bauer, and Vicellous Shannon as Keith Palmer are three recurring guest stars who can seemingly do nothing but whine and complain. Their terrible acting literally made me cringe during their scenes and almost turned me off to the show altogether. The eventual redemption of these characters in the story meant nothing to me as I could form no attachment to them because of the terrible acting. There are also a slew of minor characters who appear in only 1-2 episodes who serve the same purpose. Worst of all is Dennis Hopper, whose store-bought foreign accent is so terrible that he drops it in almost every other line.Despite the pitfalls of some of these performances, 24 is a well-written Action/Drama with an amazingly unique narrative and cinematography. The performances of the stars are exceptional enough to make you look past the regrettable supporting cast.

When the camera's not on Jack Bauer, or David Palmer the quality of the show drops WAY DOWN.This is because no body else on this show can act! besides him and the president. That's the real reason Jack Bauer is so extreme, because 96% of the other characters are BLAND or ANNOYING!! Not to mention this show has so many GAPING PLOT HOLES it's not even funny! After a while I found myself fast forwarding past every scene that didn't have either Jack, or David in it.Jack should just buy a cape, and get his own show! I truly hope the rest of the seasons aren't this bad. So do yourself a favor and don't fall into the hype like I did.

Suffice it to say, though, that I will be MAKING time for 24 in the coming weeks and months!Essentially, the plot of ""24"" involves the United States Counter Terrorism Unit (headed by Jack Bauer) trying to prevent an assassination attempt on presidential hopeful Senator David Palmer.  Many more layers area added on with each hour, but there are so many twists and turns that it would be impossible to explain them all.The plot is intriguing, but the main aspect of the show that kept my attention for, well, almost 24 hours, is the intensity of every single episode.  While some shows (The X-Files immediately comes to mind) are able to ""slack off"" and film strange episodes every once in awhile only to get back in gear for sweeps months, 24's format requires that the action never let up.  Each episode is just as important and exciting as the ones previous.Plus, to add to the complexity of the show, three different threads are going on during the show at once.  Palmer's family struggles with what to do about a family tragedy, Jack Bauer puts the intelligence pieces together, while the terrorists kidnap Jack's family and use them as leverage.  There is never a dull moment!Finally, the acting is very compelling as well.  Kiefer Sutherland (much like Matthew Fox's Jack Shepherd on LOST) is fantastically intense, while Dennis Haysbert (Palmer) almost steals the show with the portrayal of his moral/ethical dilemmas.So, if you (like I was) are looking for a show to complement LOST (or any other TV program), 24 is a great series to get hooked on.

599918,A2LXTAXALKOQSG,B00005JLF2,"Za'chary Westbrook ""Jericho""","[0, 0]","In a time when 'Survivor' ruled the ratings board, '24' emerged as a truly innovative idea. A real time TV show. An entire day in one season. The idea was critically acclaimed, but so was 'Monster's Ball'. What does that tell you? Each of the six discs has four 48 minutes episodes (the other 12 minutes were taken up by commercials in the original broadcasts) that chronicle Jack Bower as he tries to unravel the truth behind the planned assassination of the first black man with a real shot at the White House. Jack must contend with moles, kidnappings, ransom demands, and even a CTU sniper that blames Jack for the incarceration of his old partner.I was skeptical at first at the idea. While it was imaginative, it sounded very technically taxing, and most TV writers buckle under that kind of pressure. But the plot kept moving by throwing in twist after twist. The cast was extraordinarily talented, and the speed with which the plot moves makes you anxious to see what's going to happen once something's resolved. All the lies, secrets, illusions, double-agents, and wrong-place-wrong-time scenarios make '24' an indespensable title for espionage libraries.The last disc, which features a pointless introduction by Keifer Sutherland, contains an alternate ending which is very dissapointing in its feeling (or rather lack thereof). The commentary that went with it summed up my feelings when it said ""I think we sort of sabotaged ourselves [to get the ending we really wanted]."" The original ending is superb, though a little predictable. Oddly, the ending is the only part that you can see coming, when even the most predictable movies can have a totally surprising finale. THat's what this feels like, a movue, not a TV show. Buy this for the story, not the special features. Without a doubt, it's a TV history-maker.",5,The reason they created 'complete season' DVDs,1036281600,"11 3, 2002",2002,1826,"['time', 'when', ""'Survivor"", 'ruled', 'ratings', 'board', ""'24"", 'emerged', 'truly', 'innovative', 'idea', 'real', 'time', 'TV', 'show', 'entire', 'day', 'one', 'season', 'idea', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'so', 'was', 'Ball', 'What', 'tell', 'six', 'discs', 'four', '48', 'minutes', 'episodes', 'other', '12', 'minutes', 'were', 'taken', 'up', 'commercials', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'chronicle', 'Jack', 'Bower', 'unravel', 'truth', 'planned', 'assassination', 'first', 'black', 'man', 'real', 'shot', 'White', 'House', 'Jack', 'must', 'contend', 'moles', 'kidnappings', 'ransom', 'demands', 'even', 'CTU', 'sniper', 'Jack', 'incarceration', 'old', 'partner.I', 'was', 'skeptical', 'first', 'idea', 'was', 'imaginative', 'sounded', 'very', 'technically', 'taxing', 'most', 'TV', 'writers', 'buckle', 'kind', 'pressure', 'plot', 'kept', 'moving', 'throwing', 'twist', 'twist', 'cast', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'talented', 'speed', 'plot', 'moves', 'anxious', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'once', 'something', 'resolved', 'lies', 'secrets', 'illusions', 'double-agents', 'wrong-place-wrong-time', 'scenarios', 'make', 'indespensable', 'title', 'espionage', 'libraries.The', 'last', 'disc', 'pointless', 'introduction', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'alternate', 'ending', 'very', 'dissapointing', 'feeling', 'rather', 'lack', 'thereof', 'commentary', 'went', 'summed', 'up', 'feelings', 'when', 'said', 'think', 'sort', 'sabotaged', 'ourselves', '[', 'get', 'ending', 'really', 'wanted', ']', 'original', 'ending', 'superb', 'little', 'predictable', 'Oddly', 'ending', 'only', 'part', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'when', 'even', 'most', 'predictable', 'movies', 'can', 'have', 'totally', 'surprising', 'finale', 'what', 'movue', 'not', 'TV', 'show', 'Buy', 'story', 'not', 'special', 'features', 'doubt', 'TV', 'history-maker']",24: Season 1

Expensive, yes, but it enabled me to watch the show whenever I wanted..If you want really good TV that really gets you thinking, 24 is definitely the show to watch, at times, it gets a little unrealistic, but usually they patch things up with some sort of explanation later on of why something happened..Out of my family of five, we all have different tastes in television/movies, usually we all clash on these sorts of things, however, four out of the five of us got hooked on this show, with the fifth not liking action and watching very little TV as it is.I should also note that I have watched Season One in it's entirety 3 times.",5,Addicting..,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,1073,"['first', 'began', 'watch', '24', 'online', 'service', 'NetFlix', 'watched', 'one', 'episode', 'found', 'thinking', 'crazy', 'eventually', 'coming', 'back', 'show', 'when', 'troubles', 'began.See', 'plan', 'have', 'NetFlix', 'can', 'only', 'get', '3', 'DVDs', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'rate', 'NetFlix', 'queue', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'ended', 'up', 'coming', 'Amazon', 'buying', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'overnight', 'shipping..', 'Expensive', 'yes', 'enabled', 'watch', 'show', 'whenever', 'wanted..If', 'want', 'really', 'good', 'TV', 'really', 'thinking', '24', 'definitely', 'show', 'watch', 'times', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'usually', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'sort', 'explanation', 'later', 'why', 'something', 'happened..Out', 'family', 'five', 'have', 'different', 'tastes', 'television/movies', 'usually', 'clash', 'sorts', 'things', 'however', 'four', 'five', 'got', 'hooked', 'show', 'fifth', 'not', 'liking', 'action', 'watching', 'very', 'little', 'TV', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'have', 'watched', 'Season', 'One', 'entirety', '3', 'times']",24: Season 1

I have wanted to watch a show that did not have the sci-fi twist for a change. My brother suggested I watch ""24"". After watching the first episode I was hooked and I knew I would love this show.""24"" takes place obviously over a period of 24 hours. The show is centered on character Jack Bauer (Sutherland). He works for and is the director of CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) in Los Angeles. He is husband to Teri Bauer and father to Kim Bauer.The day is on the presidential primary. CTU gets wind of a very serious threat on Senator David Palmer's life. During all this, Kim is at a party and is kidnapped. Once Kim's mother Teri discovers Kim is missing, she goes out to find Kim and she too gets captured.Jack being the director of CTU, he cant just leave and rescue his family, he has to work to rescue them while he is at work. Also, Jack believes there is a mole in CTU.One of the biggest aspects of ""24"" that I like, are the many different situations. There is not just one event. There are multiple. In this way, ""24"" is similar to ""Lost"".The acting by Kiefer Sutherland (Jack Bauer) and Dennis Haysbert (Senator David Palmer) was great! The interrogation scenes are very well acted by Sutherland.Overall, season one of ""24"" is very good. About half way through it slows down for a little bit, but then ends with a boom!
