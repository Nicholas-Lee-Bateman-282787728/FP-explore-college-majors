Harvey ""Cricket ,country music and a go...","[9, 9]","The most astonishing thing about Reach For The Sky is that it is a true story .Based on a book of the same name by Douglas Bader it relates Bader's life story with particular reference to his exploits in World War two.An aviator,Bader lost both legs in an accident prior to the outbreak of war ;he mastered the use of his artificial legs and on the outbreak of war re-enlisted in the RAF.He was forced to bail out during the Battle of Britain and was captured by Germans .Safter 3 failed attempts to escape the Gerrmans took away his artificial legs and placed him in a supposedly escape proof camp -except it was nothing of the sort.The movie is tribute to the unbreakable spirit of an indomitable man .The mark of the British war movie as compared to the Hollywood product covering the same territory is that the British documentary heritage which infused so many war movies of the period-including this one -made UK movie less gung ho and the courage on display is often of the modest and unassuming variety .The scenes of his learning to live without his natural legs and his painful re-adjustment ,both mental and physical, to his new circumstances are not glossed over but neither are they dwelt upon ,We see him learning to play golf and to dance using the new legs and when we are shown his pain the camera often pulls away so we can imagine the turmoil he is enduring rather than being taken through it blow by blow .Kenneth More is excellent as Bader (who by the way acted as technical adviser on the picture)and there is a plethora of solid supporting turns by a galaxy of British actors from the period -Michael Gough ,Nigel Green ,Jack Watling .and Dorothy Allison (especially good as a sympathetic nurse)Future Bond director Lewis Gilbert did a good job of keeping this long (135 minutes )movie seem much shorter.This crisp monochrome photography is impeccable and this is a high quality tribute to a true hero ,one who brought alive Shakespeare's words ""What a piece of work is man """,4,Quintessential British 50's war  movie,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,1998,"['most', 'astonishing', 'thing', 'Reach', 'Sky', 'true', 'story', '.Based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Douglas', 'Bader', 'Bader', 'life', 'story', 'particular', 'reference', 'exploits', 'World', 'War', 'two.An', 'aviator', 'Bader', 'lost', 'legs', 'accident', 'prior', 'outbreak', 'war', 'mastered', 'use', 'artificial', 'legs', 'outbreak', 'war', 're-enlisted', 'RAF.He', 'was', 'forced', 'bail', 'out', 'Battle', 'Britain', 'was', 'captured', 'Germans', '3', 'failed', 'attempts', 'escape', 'Gerrmans', 'took', 'away', 'artificial', 'legs', 'placed', 'supposedly', 'escape', 'proof', 'camp', 'was', 'nothing', 'sort.The', 'movie', 'tribute', 'unbreakable', 'spirit', 'indomitable', 'man', '.The', 'mark', 'British', 'war', 'movie', 'compared', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'covering', 'same', 'territory', 'British', 'documentary', 'heritage', 'infused', 'so', 'many', 'war', 'movies', 'period-including', 'one', '-made', 'UK', 'movie', 'less', 'gung', 'ho', 'courage', 'display', 'often', 'modest', 'unassuming', 'variety', '.The', 'scenes', 'learning', 'live', 'natural', 'legs', 'painful', 're-adjustment', 'mental', 'physical', 'new', 'circumstances', 'are', 'not', 'glossed', 'are', 'dwelt', 'upon', 'see', 'learning', 'play', 'golf', 'dance', 'using', 'new', 'legs', 'when', 'are', 'shown', 'pain', 'camera', 'often', 'away', 'can', 'imagine', 'turmoil', 'enduring', 'rather', 'being', 'taken', 'blow', 'blow', '.Kenneth', 'More', 'excellent', 'Bader', 'who', 'way', 'acted', 'technical', 'adviser', 'picture', 'plethora', 'solid', 'supporting', 'turns', 'galaxy', 'British', 'actors', 'period', '-Michael', 'Gough', 'Nigel', 'Green', 'Jack', 'Watling', '.and', 'Dorothy', 'Allison', 'especially', 'good', 'sympathetic', 'nurse', 'Future', 'Bond', 'director', 'Lewis', 'Gilbert', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'long', '135', 'minutes', 'movie', 'seem', 'much', 'shorter.This', 'crisp', 'monochrome', 'photography', 'impeccable', 'high', 'quality', 'tribute', 'true', 'hero', 'one', 'who', 'brought', 'alive', 'Shakespeare', 'words', 'What', 'piece', 'work', 'man']",N/A

547433,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00004CYY5,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is an EXCELLENT film, telling an almost unbelievable, but nevertheless STRICTLY TRUE STORY. This review contains some limited SPOILERS.Before going further, one more precision. For the purpose of this review I decided to assume that some people may actually NOT KNOW today who Sir Douglas Bader was, what were his achievements and why was he such an exceptionnal man - and therefore I purposefully decided to remain vague about some details of his life, career and adventures, so those who decide to watch this film can enjoy the twists and surprises...Group Captain Sir Douglas Robert Steuart Bader, CBE, DSO & Bar, DFC & Bar, FRAeS, DL was born on 21 February 1910 in London. In his early years he was a very promising athlete and especially a very agressive and fearless rugby player - later he also caught the demon of speed and excelled in motorcycle and car races. However it was the flying that became his greatest passion and in 1918 he joined the RAF as a cadet officer - he quickly earned quite a reputation even amongst more experienced pilots. His promissing career was however cut short by an extremely serious incident in 1931. Desperate to be allowed to stay in RAF and fly again, Bader waged a titanic struggle for two years on many fronts, but ultimately the high command of RAF proved to be too strong. From 1933 to 1939 Bader had to take a civilian job.Great Britain entry to war in 1939 allowed Bader to try again and this time he prevailed. He was allowed to fly again and to join a RAF Fighter Command squadron equipped with the just introduced into service Spitfires. Soon after that, he became a LIVING LEGEND and entered for ever into the hall of immortal glory of greatest pilots who ever lived! In war time, even Luftwaffe pilots and generals, to whom Bader caused a great amount of grief, literally worshipped him! In what circumstances he accomplished this? Well, if you do not know it yet, please DO NOT look it up on the internet - instead, buy and watch this EXCELLENT film...This film doesn't go further than World War II, but Sir Douglas Bader lived a long and well filled life after 1945, before dying from a heart attack in 1982 in London. His funeral was attended by a crowd of dignitaries and personalities, amongst whom was also ex-Luftwaffe general Adolf Galland, an ace with 104 victories (including some piloting a Me-262 jet fighter in last days of WWII), whom Bader befriended in 1945.Bader was known for his strong opinions and he cared little for diplomacy - once, meeting after war a large group of former Luftwaffe pilots, he exclaimed ""My God, I had no idea we left so many of you bastards alive!"". A life long conservative, he never hid also his opposition to many developments of British post-war society, even if this attracted him the hostility of most left-winged medias - he especially until his last days advocated te re-establish the death penalty and strongly limit the immigration. He was also until his last day a great defender of memory of Sir Arthur Harris, so horribly mistreated by ""progressive"" historians and journalists.""Reach for the sky"" is a long film (2h15) but I swear you will not see or feel the time passing by! It has rather few action scenes, but its real strength is in the brilliant, witty dialogs and excellent performance of all actors, beginning of course with the brilliant Kenneth More who plays Bader himself.Initially Richard Burton was supposed to play this role - but after reading the script More pulled all the strings and favors he could to obtain it and I believe it was for the best for this film, his own career - and also Richard Burton himself... By a strange coincidence, both Bader and More died the same year, only weeks apart (More on 12 July, Bader on 5 September).Lovely Muriel Pavlow, who although retired from playing since 2009 still is with us as of July 2013, gave also a brilliant performance as Bader's wife, Thelma, whom he courted for months with his usual energy and with whom he ultimately spend 34 happy years until her untimely death from cancer in 1967...Dorothy Alison, who plays Nurse Brace, gives the most powerful performance amongst the second roles - she is absolutely impresive here.I will say it again - this film absolutely IMPRESSED me, both by the skill of movie-making it displays and by the powerful lesson its larger than life hero teaches. Sir Douglas Bader lived the most crucial years of his life in the time of giants and he sat amongst them as equal. This man decided to reach for the sky and even if the whole world was holding him down, he would not be denied. When he set his eyes on a worthy prize, be it a woman, a career or even simply a good fight, he would get it - come hell, high water or both... And watching him struggle for all of it, is a great and inspiring thing.Bottom line - buy it, watch it and keep it for your children. Enjoy!",5,"""You'll never walk again without a stick.""

He had a tendency to run roughshod over opposition and didn't care who or what got in his way.  That being said for the time period that the movie was great. A nice example of 1950s British cinema with its attempts to recall the glory days of the Empire. Seeing actual Hurricanes & Spitfires in action was fantastic.
