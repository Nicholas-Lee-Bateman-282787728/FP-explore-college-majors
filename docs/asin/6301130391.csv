Renkert ""J.FREDERICK""","[0, 0]",I'm a James Caan fan forever.Even the beauitful Genevieve Bujold was perfect in her role.Long drawn out in parts..but worth the money.The only thing I hated about this movie & I do mean HATED ..was in the very opening of the movie their doing a t.v.commerical with four horses pulling a car..advertising...how we have  advance since horse & buggy..showing James Caan with mustage in this part only..telling the director this is all wrong.He advises the director to come to his house so that he can show him pictures of his grandfather or great  grandfather from the 1800's how it was..then it fads into the movie in the 1800's.I still can't figure out that part of the movie..it just didn't make any sense to me.But the movie itself was slow....BUT...So real to life.Thankyou.

245553,A16VIPDOCCVNU7,6301130391,Jack N. Young,"[6, 6]","I was the Location Manager on this movie. Claude LeLouch is one of the great Directors of our time. You might remember he directed MAN AND WOMAN. Jimmie Caan was the star and I had worked with him before on El Dorado. The acting is great and I know you will love the locations in and around Tucson, Arizona. Also, in the Sonoita foothills of rolling green. One of the scenes that was cut I wish had stayed. It was the longest, uncut piece, I had ever seen. At Old Tucson, we had laid track across the street from the train depot to the Hotel. LeLouch is on the camera crane, holding the camera on his shoulder. Cann gets off the train, walks halfway across the street (camera crane rolls with him)he stops and chats with someone, then continues into the hotel, camera goes around the corner, looks through the window as Jimmie registers. As he starts up the stairs the crane rises up to the second floor window as we see him enter the room. Then, Claude steps off the crane and through the window as Jimmie sits on the bed. A great shot and why they chose to cut it up I don't know. But, you will enjoy this movie which will take you through time and beyond.",4,"Another man, Another chance.",1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,1158,"['was', 'Location', 'Manager', 'movie', 'Claude', 'LeLouch', 'one', 'great', 'Directors', 'time', 'might', 'remember', 'directed', 'MAN', 'AND', 'WOMAN', 'Jimmie', 'Caan', 'was', 'star', 'had', 'worked', 'El', 'Dorado', 'acting', 'great', 'know', 'will', 'love', 'locations', 'Tucson', 'Arizona', 'Also', 'Sonoita', 'foothills', 'rolling', 'green', 'One', 'scenes', 'was', 'cut', 'wish', 'had', 'stayed', 'was', 'longest', 'uncut', 'piece', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'Old', 'Tucson', 'had', 'laid', 'track', 'street', 'train', 'depot', 'Hotel', 'LeLouch', 'camera', 'crane', 'holding', 'camera', 'shoulder', 'Cann', 'train', 'walks', 'halfway', 'street', 'camera', 'crane', 'rolls', 'chats', 'someone', 'then', 'hotel', 'camera', 'corner', 'window', 'Jimmie', 'registers', 'up', 'stairs', 'crane', 'second', 'floor', 'window', 'see', 'enter', 'room', 'Then', 'Claude', 'crane', 'window', 'Jimmie', 'bed', 'great', 'shot', 'why', 'chose', 'cut', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'time']","Another Man, Another Chance VHS"
