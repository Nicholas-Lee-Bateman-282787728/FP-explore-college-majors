Well Larry Guithery (Larry the Cable Guy) makes it possible.  He is on a mission, but not just any mission, a mission to restore faith in the tooth fairy and to keep his best memory.  This is an enjoyable movie.  There isn't a dull moment or a moment when I did not laugh.  The main characters in this film include Larry Guithery (Larry the Cable Guy; Cars 1 and Cars 2).  Other main characters are Beauregard ""Bo"" Billings (David Mackey), Brook (Erin Beute), the adorable tooth fairy, Nyx (Bradley Reiter).  All of the tooth fairy costumes are out of this world.  When I saw Larry in a pink tutu and tights I laughed my head off!  That is one of my favorite costumes and scenes.  I recommend this movie for ages 5-12.  If parents watch this movie with their kids, they will find it to be funny and a good story.  Kids of these ages will like this film because of the jokes and comedy.  Tooth Fairy 2 ranges from physical and exaggerated comedy to romance and love.  It has fart jokes and funny dancing that made both my mom and I laugh.  I knew from the moment I saw Larry the Cable Guy that this movie is hilarious and I was right.  Even though some of the silly jokes do not fully grab my attention and make me laugh, I give Tooth Fairy 2 , four stars.
