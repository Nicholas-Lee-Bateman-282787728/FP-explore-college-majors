1665274,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B00E8AVNAE,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[1, 1]","Danny Trejo, the one who made his movie career with his very recognizable face, is a busy man and he is enjoying his Hollywood moment. With a new ""Machete"" - yes, that guy -- film coming out pretty soon, he is at the top of his game. ""Dead in Tombstone"" is an enjoyable western, with a dose of fun and horror, released just in time for Halloween.Right at the beginning of the movie, we meet the devil (Mickey Rourke) taking about how evil the west is, saying at one point that ""in the west, I never go hungry."" Then we are taken to the last minutes of Red Cavanaugh (an aged and unrecognizable Anthony Michael Hall), who is about to meet his maker by hanging. However, he is saved at the last minute by his buddies from the Black Water Gang, led by Guerrero de la Paz (Trejo). Once free, and celebrating his escape with the gang, Red tells Guerrero that he has a new plan to make money. He informs Guerrero that there is a dispute over the ownership of a large quantity of gold in the town of Edendale, in Colorado, and that the gold is being stored in the local bank. Red thinks that they should rob the bank and that the job should be easy. Guerrero agrees with him, and off they go. Lucky for them, everything goes smoothly for them, and they secure the gold. Unfortunately, Red had another plan: become the town's new marshal (having killed the current one during the robbery), and rule it with the help of his crime partners. Guerrero is against that (he is a bandit, but has some morals) and is shot to death. Enter the devil (Rourke), who accepts an offer from Guerrero (in hell by now) that he can't refuse.""Dead in Tombstone"" was filmed in Romania, with beautiful, snowy landscapes, good production design, and directed by Roel Ren&eacute;. The movie is colorful, yet dark when it needs to be, and successfully mixes western with horror. It has some great lines, like when Red tells Guerrero, ""You don't have to do this, brother. There is plenty of gold to go around,"" to which Guerrero responds, ""I prefer lead."" The film also has plenty suspense, and it will remind you of a Gary Cooper's classic called ""High Noon."" In fact, in one scene, the devil tells Guerrero that it's ""high noon, hombre."" The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital unrated edition includes deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, commentaries, and more.

1665280,A5CWA7CNUXLWW,B00E8AVNAE,"Edward Lindo ""Patriot""","[1, 1]","Dead in Tombstone was completed in 2012, but post production problems delayed the release date until Oct. 2013. It was well worth the wait! The movie reminds of the short lived TV Show 'Brimstone' where a damned soul earns redemption by tracking down other damned souls and sending them back to Hell. In 'Dead in Tombstone' a leader of an outlaw gang is murdered by his own gang and for all the sins of his life he is sent to Hell. Once there he makes a deal with the Devil to deliver the souls of the six men who killed him in exchange for his own salvation. The movie starts with the Black Water Gang breaking one of their members out of prison. As each member is introduced with a close up, a wanted poster for that outlaw appears. It's a great way to introduce the gang. Danny Trejo plays Guerrero Hernamdez leader of the gang. Anthony Michael Hall plays his lieutenant and Mickey Rourke plays a stellar role as the Devil. After the break out Hall tells Trejo about a bank job in Colorado that could have the gang set for life. So the gang rides to Colorado and they hit the bank. After the deed is done Hall wants to take over the gang and he shoots Trejo. The rest of the gang joins in and Trejo is murdered.Once in Hell Trejo makes a deal with the Devil to kill the six men who betrayed him in exchange for his salvation. The Devil accepts under two conditions, 1st Trejo only has 24 hours to deliver them to him and all six must die by his hand. So starts a 24-hour non-stop action thrill ride. I waited over a year for this movie and I was not disappointed. It was well worth the wait. I will not give a way the ending, but a possible sequel or series of sequels was set up. The special features include Deleted Scenes, Deleted Scenes Montage, Making of dead in Tombstone Featurette, and a Feature Commentary. The disc also includes the R-Rated Version and the Unrated Version.

This Western did not deliver any of the goods expected - not even for a B movie. No scenes really stood out as memorable. The action, humor, and overall acting was mediocre at best. Trejo didn't even appear as a proficient gun slinger - his quick draws seemed somewhat jerky and one would think his character would be killed ten times over with skills like his. Even with a little twist at the end, the storyline plays into a very typical Western flick. No 'surprises' go without already being easily foreseen by the viewer.  And basically, there's nothing much new in this Western that hasn't been done before.Had Trejo's character been more creative in knocking off his fellow gang members,  this movie could have had some potential - but, again, it just kept on being just another bland movie.

And in Brandon Lee's &#34;The Crow,&#34; we have a rocker who gets murdered and is brought back to life to avenge his murder by killing the gang of thugs that killed him.  That's basically what we got here with Danny Trejo's &#34;Dead in Tombstone.&#34;Danny Trejo is a co-leader of a 7-member gang, who's other leader, his half brother, (Anthony Michael Hall) betrays him and shoots and kills him in cold blood.  Trejo dies and goes to Hell, where the Devil (Mickey Rourke) cuts him a deal to go back to the world of the living to kill the remaining 6 members of the gang within 24 hours, or be forever condemned to Hell.The setting, of course, is an Old West town by the name of Edenville, CO.  Wait, what?  Yeah...the name of the town was Edenville...originally.  What happens is that after the gang kills Trejo, they take over the town and rename it Tombstone.  But Tombstone was in AZ, right?  (More on that later...)  Well, anyway, this film was very well done in terms of the setting the western costuming.  It was actually film on the border of Transylvania in Romania.  But you'd never know it.  The costuming was dirty and  gritty, with the multi-layered trenchcoat combinations.  Gun shot sounds were very well mixed into the audio track.  And the town itself was a redress actual Romanian town.  3 or so blocks worth where CG paint-outs and background paint-ins, tranformed this town to a very believable Western town.  So as far as a modern contemporary Western goes, it was very well done.As far as the name Tombstone goes, in a deleted scene that is a film ender shows that the townsfolk removing the town sign and loading it up on a horse wagon that is headed South to AZ....and so there ya go...As for why not a 5-star rating, I think the deletion of some of the deleted scenes were a mistake that could have added a bit to the story.

This movie was well written and beautifully filmed. Stunning cinematography. Stunning props, western sets, period wardrobes, and make-up.  Great special effects and acting. This movie is very impressive, and we all love (Danny Trejo) who plays a very good (gritty) outlaw.  No surprises there, as (Danny Trejo) is well suited for the tough guy roles. I think Mr. Trejo plays western cowboy characters very well, and should continue to bring us more western movies. There are no (dry or boring) areas in this movie; it's full-on action from the start and lots of serious gun fights and blood.

Dead in Tombstone is a mix of &#8220;The Crow&#8221; and &#8220;High Plains Drifter&#8221;, A supernatural revenge western and the perfect vehicle for Trejo&#8217;s talents.  The film begins with Guerrero (Trejo) leading his gang in a daring rescue of fellow member Red Cavanaugh (Anthony Michael Hall) who is about to be hanged.  After his rescue, Cavanaugh reveals a tip he received about a small Colorado mining town that has struck gold but its residents are in a dispute over rights and the gold is locked away in a vault.  The heist could set the gang up and Guerrero agrees to lead the raidThe gang easily overruns the town&#8217;s sheriff and meager resistance but while Guerrero wants to take the gold and leave, Cavanaugh wants to take over the town.  This leads to Red and the rest of the gang killing Guerrero and renaming the town Tombstone.  Guerrero is buried in the town cemetery but that&#8217;s where this western takes a turn for the supernatural.  The outlaw is condemned to Hell and confronted by Lucifer himself (Mickey Roarke).  Guerrero makes a deal with the devil to deliver the six souls of the murderous gang members in exchange for his own.  Guerrero literally crawls out of the grave to seek revenge on his former mate in a violent and bloody rampage.Roarke&#8217;s satanic portrayal isn&#8217;t much different than a lot of his recent performances.  He&#8217;s kind of laid back and smarmy but his devilish side comes out as he digs his fingers deep into Guerrero&#8217;s chest, licking the blood from his fingers with a malevolent grin.  His part is small but oozes wickedness from every pore.  It&#8217;s also to see Anthony Michael Hall in a villainous role and he clearly is having a wonderful time being the bad guy.  Dina Meyer is also tossed into the mix as the wife of the Sheriff.  Other than that, however, the rest of the cast is just there as fodder for Trejo to mow down.

When I ordered this, I was a litle hesitant because I expected it to be pure grindhouse but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. I got that but more also. Granted there is plenty of violence but there's a fairly coherent storyline through it also.  An outlaw is double-crossed by his gang and killed, ending up in Hell where he makes a deal with the Devil to deliver his killers so he can go free. Deal with the devil? Expect a double-cross. Right?  He lines up six empty coffins in front of the church and proceeds to fill each one while the devil looks on as a bystander.  This movie was entertaining and well-acted with some very artistic camera work though I could've done with fewer slow-motion shots. Since most of the action takes place at night, we get few scenery shots but the couple they show make the Transylvanian countryside (where this was shot) look very much like some US Western locale.

Suffice it to say, Mr. Rourke is typecast as the devil himself, and our majestic hero, Mr. Trejo, plays an avenging angel.  I don't know if it is a coincidence that Mr. Trejo's horse's name was &#34;George&#34; (he's starring with another &#34;George&#34; in the Saint George sit-com), but he was beautiful--as was Mr,Trejo.  In this story, Mr. Trejo is tasked with killing his former murderous and generally unsavory criminal gang in exchange for escaping hell and damnation. He only needed to kill 6 people, but I'd say the body count was probably about 4 times that.  Too bad Rourke didn't give him extra credit for volume. Michael Anthony Hall (whom I've loved since his days in Sixteen Candles and Dead Zone) was gleefully evil in his role as the arch villain.  There is a lovely lady heroine which unfortunately(for Mr Trejo) doesn't turn out to be a love interest for him but did a good job as the virtuous widow of the town's deceased lawman.  Mr. Rourke materializes periodically throughout the movie in various scenes making himself known at first in Mr.Trejo's nightmares (mine, too, actually).  There is a lot of gore with my favorite scene involving showing Mr.Trejo from the back in a seated position apparently nude(guess they buried him naked because that was how he climbed out of his grave) when he fires some sort of cannon type gun and blows a person's head into smithereens. Unfortunately (for me anyway) he locates his clothing, dresses, grabs George the horse (who remembers him) and is off on his adventure to murder his entire former gang.  There is a very brief &#34;titillating&#34; (emphasis on the &#34;tit&#34; part) scene where a young half naked lady runs across the screen, wearing nothing but her ruffled knickers and her knockers (surgically enhanced of course.)My favorite scene for Mr. Trejo (hard to pick but seemed realistic) was him leaping off his beautiful black steed as the steed was falling and was sliding sideways . He stuck that landing very well.  Unfortunately, due to recent &#34;work&#34;, Mr. Rourke mainly looked astonished (and with really dirty scruffy hair) instead of evil, and our wonderful Mr. Trejo makes this movie worth watching. Perhaps Mr. Trejo can give Mr. Rourke some hair washing and hair combing tips if Mr. Rourke continues to wear his hair long like Mr. Trejo does.This is another keeper for my Trejo collection!",5,Mr Trejo delights his fans in a back from the dead personna that doesn't involve zombies,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,2489,"['wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'back', 'dvd', 'package', 'movie', 'place', 'wild', 'west', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Mr.', 'Rourke', 'typecast', 'devil', 'majestic', 'hero', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'avenging', 'angel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'coincidence', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'horse', 'name', 'was', '34', 'George', '34', 'starring', '34', 'George', '34', 'Saint', 'George', 'sit-com', 'was', 'beautiful', 'was', 'Mr', 'Trejo', 'story', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'tasked', 'killing', 'former', 'murderous', 'generally', 'unsavory', 'criminal', 'gang', 'exchange', 'escaping', 'hell', 'damnation', 'only', 'needed', 'kill', '6', 'people', ""'d"", 'say', 'body', 'count', 'was', 'probably', 'about', '4', 'times', 'Too', 'bad', 'Rourke', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'extra', 'credit', 'volume', 'Michael', 'Anthony', 'Hall', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'days', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'was', 'gleefully', 'evil', 'role', 'arch', 'villain', 'lovely', 'lady', 'heroine', 'unfortunately', 'Mr', 'Trejo', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'love', 'interest', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'virtuous', 'widow', 'town', 'deceased', 'lawman', 'Mr.', 'Rourke', 'periodically', 'movie', 'various', 'scenes', 'making', 'known', 'first', 'Mr.Trejo', 'nightmares', 'mine', 'too', 'actually', 'lot', 'gore', 'favorite', 'scene', 'involving', 'showing', 'Mr.Trejo', 'back', 'seated', 'position', 'apparently', 'nude', 'guess', 'buried', 'naked', 'was', 'how', 'climbed', 'grave', 'when', 'sort', 'cannon', 'type', 'gun', 'person', 'head', 'smithereens', 'Unfortunately', 'anyway', 'clothing', 'dresses', 'grabs', 'George', 'horse', 'who', 'off', 'adventure', 'murder', 'entire', 'former', 'gang', 'very', 'brief', '34', 'titillating', '34', 'emphasis', '34', 'tit', '34', 'part', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'half', 'naked', 'lady', 'screen', 'wearing', 'nothing', 'ruffled', 'knickers', 'knockers', 'surgically', 'enhanced', 'course', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'hard', 'pick', 'seemed', 'realistic', 'was', 'leaping', 'off', 'beautiful', 'black', 'steed', 'steed', 'was', 'falling', 'was', 'sliding', 'sideways', 'stuck', 'landing', 'very', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'due', 'recent', '34', 'work', '34', 'Mr.', 'Rourke', 'mainly', 'looked', 'astonished', 'really', 'dirty', 'scruffy', 'hair', 'instead', 'evil', 'wonderful', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'movie', 'watching', 'Perhaps', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'can', 'give', 'Mr.', 'Rourke', 'hair', 'washing', 'hair', 'combing', 'tips', 'Mr.', 'Rourke', 'wear', 'hair', 'long', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'keeper', 'Trejo', 'collection']",N/A

It is refreshing to see this slick, stylish return to the genre in Director Roel Reine's 'DEAD IN TOMBSTONE'-2011 highlighting crater faced cult actor Danny Trejo with non stop shoot em up action.  Double crossed by his brother played by slimy Anthony Michael Hall and plugged with enough rounds to sink Afghanistan, Trejo is sent to hell where we have Mickey Rourke giving an eerie performance as Lucifer himself.  Striking a bargain for his soul, Trejo is sent back to the land of the living for only 24 hours to deliver the souls of his brother and five gang members in exchange for his life.  The over 100 minute running time is dedicated to that plot as Director Reine stylishly piles on images of every conceivable genre cliche and it works.  Director Reine known basically for the last two sequels of the 'DEATH RACE' franchise is honing his craft brilliantly and gets great perfs from all including television actress Dina Meyer as a fetching gunslinger who aids Trejo.  The bullets fly, the slow mo cams upset the stomach, and rat a tat editing stuns the cranium as the revenge motif reaches for the climax which may or may not spawn a sequel.  I viewed the unrated Blu-Ray disc which is in stunning 1080P 1.85 widescreen with great DTS MasterAudio to rattle the subwoofer.  The disc has a fistful of extras including featurettes on the making of the film ; a 10 minute stint on the director Roel Reine; deleted scenes and a deleted scene montage and feature commentary to name but a few.  Highly recommended to action enthusiasts and Western fans (the film has hommages to Italian Horror films and Spaghetti Westerns) and a rockin music score by Hybrid, it makes for a great purchase and I can hardly wait for the sequel.
