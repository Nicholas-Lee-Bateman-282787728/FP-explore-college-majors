508758,A1O1YZYT7J6LXB,B00000K02S,Joseph T. Reeves,"[28, 28]","&quot;Fly Girls&quot; is the story of the Women's Air Force Service Pilots (WASPs) of World War II, who have been neglected and unappreciated for many years.  The WASPs were formed to ferry aircraft, tow targets and serve as  instructors so male pilots could be freed for combat roles. But, as this  film shows, the WASPs faced danger every day by flying every aircraft in  the military inventory which more than proved the ability of women to serve  as pilots.  The WASPs were given the dangerous and dirty jobs to do, and  they excelled despite the openly expressed doubts of male pilots.&quot;Fly Girls&quot; benefits from the contemporary interviews of many  surviving WASPs.  These interviews, along with archival footage, capture  the truly important job these pilots were doing and reflect the can-do  attitude that permeated all levels of World War II American society.  Although this film does chronicle the support the WASPs received from top  military leaders, these women were not recognized as military members and  were not even given veteran status until 1977.

Thus, I purchased this DVD from PBS and watched it recently. I have to say, though much of it I already read about, it was a great pleasure to actually see these ladies on the screen. I not only saw and listened to the older women reminisce, but also viewed old video and footage of them flying, marching, throwing each other in the fountain, running from snakes, everything.It's so awesome to SEE it, not just read it.I also learned that in a way, Cochran was the downfall of the WASP. Apparently they could have been militarized had she been willing to be under another woman colonel. This would have been the combining of the WASP with the WAC, but Jackie couldn't stand the idea of being under the command of a woman who &#34;doesn't know her a** from a propeller&#34;.Hum. I'm not a fan of Cochran. But that's funny.Some facts:-The WASP flew a total of 60 million miles during their service.-38 women died.-They made 3k a year.-They had &#34;dating lists&#34; by the phone at Camp Davis. One list of men that were okay to date, one list of men who weren't.-Cornelia Fort was killed by a male pilot who clipped her wing.-The women stored high-heeled shoes in the wings, where normally bullets went.-Some went to be test pilots and there was a cool bit about the effects of being at 25,000 feet, of how they couldn't even spell their own name.-During their 6-month training, they had to do 200 flight hours and 400 ground school hours.-At least 100 male pilots found mysterious reasons to land at Avenger Field the first week of the WASP training.-Camp Davis had problems...lots of harassment of the life-threatening sort and discrimination. There was sabotage and sugar was found in a gas tank, but darling Jackie was unwilling to jeopardize her program so kept it quiet.Some of this I knew, some of it I didn't. Some, I just needed reminders of, but as I said above, you can't beat the real video reels and the photos and oh, the women telling their tales. Even of the B-29 ladies is on this! I especially enjoyed the white-haired lady (the one who flew the B-29) who provided the quote posted above. The videos even show us the simulators they used at Avenger Field.For the aviation or WWII enthusiast, or even just the feminist, this is a DVD I highly recommend for you.",5,Terrific Documentary About Amazing Women,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,2418,"['thought', 'knew', 'was', 'know', 'WASP', 'having', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'books', 'now', 'always', 'room', 'more', 'knowledge', 'Thus', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'PBS', 'watched', 'recently', 'have', 'say', 'though', 'much', 'already', 'read', 'was', 'great', 'pleasure', 'actually', 'see', 'ladies', 'screen', 'not', 'only', 'saw', 'listened', 'older', 'women', 'reminisce', 'also', 'viewed', 'old', 'video', 'footage', 'flying', 'marching', 'throwing', 'other', 'fountain', 'running', 'snakes', 'everything.It', 'so', 'awesome', 'SEE', 'not', 'just', 'read', 'it.I', 'also', 'learned', 'way', 'Cochran', 'was', 'downfall', 'WASP', 'Apparently', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'militarized', 'had', 'been', 'willing', 'be', 'woman', 'colonel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'combining', 'WASP', 'WAC', 'Jackie', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'idea', 'being', 'command', 'woman', 'who', '34', ""n't"", 'know', 'a**', 'propeller', '34', '.Hum', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Cochran', 'funny.Some', 'facts', '-The', 'WASP', 'flew', 'total', '60', 'million', 'miles', 'service.-38', 'women', 'died.-They', 'made', '3k', 'year.-They', 'had', '34', 'dating', 'lists', '34', 'phone', 'Camp', 'Davis', 'One', 'list', 'men', 'were', 'okay', 'date', 'one', 'list', 'men', 'who', ""weren't.-Cornelia"", 'Fort', 'was', 'killed', 'male', 'pilot', 'who', 'clipped', 'wing.-The', 'women', 'stored', 'high-heeled', 'shoes', 'wings', 'where', 'normally', 'went.-Some', 'went', 'be', 'test', 'pilots', 'was', 'cool', 'bit', 'effects', 'being', '25,000', 'feet', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'spell', 'own', 'name.-During', '6-month', 'training', 'had', 'do', '200', 'flight', 'hours', '400', 'ground', 'school', 'hours.-At', 'least', '100', 'male', 'pilots', 'found', 'mysterious', 'reasons', 'land', 'Avenger', 'Field', 'first', 'week', 'WASP', 'training.-Camp', 'Davis', 'had', 'problems', 'lots', 'harassment', 'life-threatening', 'sort', 'discrimination', 'was', 'sabotage', 'sugar', 'was', 'found', 'gas', 'tank', 'darling', 'Jackie', 'was', 'unwilling', 'jeopardize', 'program', 'so', 'kept', 'quiet.Some', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'needed', 'reminders', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'real', 'video', 'reels', 'photos', 'oh', 'women', 'telling', 'tales', 'Even', 'B-29', 'ladies', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'white-haired', 'lady', 'one', 'who', 'flew', 'B-29', 'who', 'provided', 'quote', 'posted', 'videos', 'even', 'show', 'simulators', 'used', 'Avenger', 'Field.For', 'aviation', 'WWII', 'enthusiast', 'even', 'just', 'feminist', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

In contemporary interviews, Chuck Yeager and Paul Tibbits gushed praise for these amazing women and their accomplishments and abilities.  The women themselves talked about their life back in WWII and the stories were inspiring and stirring.These women paved the way for women's liberation and even though the WASPS were disbanded in December 1944, without ever being granted military status, they broke through one barrier after another and really changed the way this country thought about women.Their planes were occasionally sabotaged and they put up with a lot of nonsense from their male counterparts, but they pushed on.
