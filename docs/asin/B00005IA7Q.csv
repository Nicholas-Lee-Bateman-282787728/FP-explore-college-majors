581850,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B00005IA7Q,maskedgamer,"[4, 4]","Although this one is not for entertainment. White Badge is an intriguing film that shows what happens to soldiers once they return home. War changes them and going back to a normal life and the promises they made when they left isn't so easy. For the most part there aren't any ""heroes"" in this film. There's no Rambo's in their platoon. Everyone is jumpy,everyone is nervous, and no one wants to get killed. They all have a purpose and a reason for being there in Vietnam and a goal or a plan waiting for them when they get back home. As the movie plays out you see how the Soldiers how the soldiers were after the war, and then as the movie progresses you see the kind of people they were before the war.I've heard this movie referenced to ""DeerHunter"" and in the movie there's a scene where one of the soldiers stares at a Movie poster of ""DeerHunter"". Although I don't think Deer hunter or any other movie really has much to do with this film. It's reality. War changes people and there are many things soldiers have to deal with that they didn't expect. Not everyone that survives a war survives it mentally intact. Deerhunter,White Badge, and the like can probably be told by many veterans who haven't seen either of these films.What's the greatest part about this movie is that it's from the Korean perspective. Even though it's an entirely different country the sacrifices and the emotions are the same. I really enjoyed this film because it was dark,gritty and real. Don't expect HD quality but you can expect an outstanding movie watching this. The combat scenes aren't exactly ""Saving Private Ryans"" but they fit the mood of the movie well. The Blackness of the night with only Shadows moving and hands and arms being seen flailing gives insight to the chaos and unexpectedness of battle. Not knowing whats going on but you just want to protect your life and the lives of your comrades. Great Movie!BTW someone mentioned something about Vietnamese farmers not being able to write signs? I suggest you read up on Vietnamese history and especially the Vietcong. Because they are rural does not mean they are primitive.",5,Fantastick War Movie...,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,2127,"['one', 'not', 'entertainment', 'White', 'Badge', 'intriguing', 'film', 'what', 'soldiers', 'return', 'home', 'War', 'going', 'back', 'normal', 'life', 'promises', 'made', 'when', 'left', ""n't"", 'so', 'easy', 'most', 'part', 'are', ""n't"", 'heroes', 'film', 'Rambo', 'platoon', 'Everyone', 'jumpy', 'everyone', 'nervous', 'one', 'get', 'killed', 'have', 'purpose', 'reason', 'being', 'Vietnam', 'goal', 'plan', 'waiting', 'when', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'movie', 'out', 'see', 'how', 'Soldiers', 'how', 'soldiers', 'were', 'war', 'then', 'movie', 'see', 'kind', 'people', 'were', 'war.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', 'referenced', 'DeerHunter', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'soldiers', 'stares', 'Movie', 'poster', 'DeerHunter', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Deer', 'hunter', 'other', 'movie', 'really', 'much', 'do', 'film', 'reality', 'War', 'changes', 'people', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'soldiers', 'have', 'deal', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Not', 'everyone', 'war', 'mentally', 'intact', 'Deerhunter', 'White', 'Badge', 'like', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'told', 'many', 'veterans', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'greatest', 'part', 'movie', 'Korean', 'perspective', 'Even', 'entirely', 'different', 'country', 'sacrifices', 'emotions', 'are', 'same', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'dark', 'gritty', 'real', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'HD', 'quality', 'can', 'expect', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'watching', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryans', 'fit', 'mood', 'movie', 'well', 'Blackness', 'night', 'only', 'Shadows', 'moving', 'hands', 'arms', 'being', 'seen', 'flailing', 'insight', 'chaos', 'unexpectedness', 'battle', 'Not', 'knowing', 'whats', 'going', 'just', 'want', 'protect', 'life', 'lives', 'comrades', 'Great', 'Movie', 'BTW', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'something', 'Vietnamese', 'farmers', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'write', 'signs', 'suggest', 'read', 'up', 'Vietnamese', 'history', 'especially', 'Vietcong', 'are', 'rural', 'not', 'mean', 'are', 'primitive']",N/A
