1017876,AIMR915K4YCN,B000I0QLSM,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[3, 3]","A man named Steve Roland (Billy Wirth) takes his daughter in for a routine MRI. All is well until she begins seizing and her brainwaves go flat. What went wrong? Why did this girl simply die? Roland wants answers. During a hospital board meeting, it is disclosed that other patients have died suddenly. The hospital, fearing lawsuits, puts all of the blame on the doctor performing the scans. Roland meets w/ the doctor and discovers that an experimental drug had been used on the other patients, but not on his daughter. He launches his own investigation, posing as a tech worker at the hospital. Roland enlists the help of another doctor who witnessed his daughter's death. Soon, bad things start happening to anyone who opens their mouth. A conspiracy is under way, and Roland, along w/ anyone who tries to help him, is in serious danger. Another death occurs during an MRI, and the technician decides to suggest that the machine be shut down. He is beaten almost to death, and winds up framed for the MRI ""malfunctions"". Roland's inquiries lead to further revelations of malfeasance and nefarious goings-on. He is nearly killed. Can he uncover the truth before his life is prematurely terminated? THE DRONE VIRUS is an excellent medical thriller in the same vein as movies like COMA or ANATOMY. There's something about the prospect of eeevil, conspiratorial doctors that's extra frightening.

There is some bad acting, over-acting, and the writing is what you would expect for a B-production. I noticed a lot of exuberant reviews. I think these folks are giving the film too much praise. It is a solid 2.5-3. Your average film that will entertain, but not impress.",3,It's an OK Film,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,344,"['movie', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'B-movie', 'quality', 'bad', 'acting', 'over-acting', 'writing', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'B-production', 'noticed', 'lot', 'exuberant', 'reviews', 'think', 'folks', 'are', 'giving', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'praise', 'solid', '2.5-3', 'average', 'film', 'will', 'entertain', 'not', 'impress']",The Drone Virus
1017878,A1GTOIX13PLVL6,B000I0QLSM,John M. Dlugosz,"[6, 12]","The movie was an enjoyable thriller/mystery that features a final twist at the end which I will not spoil.  Although adequately foreshadowed, there are some events that don't quite make sense in the new light, so it's slightly unsatisfying, like it was tacked on at the end rather than building towards it.What really bothers me about the movie is the central idea that a MRI machine can kill people due to malicious code inserted into its firmware.  The ""drone virus"" refers to a computer virus that allows PCs to become zombies and due to bidding of the controller.  This is a problem with unsecured Windows PCs in real life, but the malware here is not a virus at all, but does allow remote operation, in this case to fry patient's brains.So, how does an MRI fry someone's brain, making it looks like some kind of unknown seizure?  They say repeatedly that it ""increases the radiation"".  Well, an MRI doesn't involve radiation of any kind, but rather uses a big magnet to align the water molecules in the body; when the field is switched off the molecules swing back, emitting a very faint signal that is picked up by the machine.  The radio frequency used might be considered ""radiation"", it is not ""ionizing radiation"" meaning it doesn't knock things loose from molecules in the body, and doesn't cause any damage whatsoever.  The only risks involve flying metal objects, and getting too hot.I worry that this will only create fear of a machine that is perfectly safe, or perhaps is a symptom that such misplaced fear already exists in the general population.  Perhaps the book was better (more technically plausible) and the movie messed it up?Like many movies these days, it will be enjoyed more if you don't know anything about computers.  In this case, it's also enjoyable if you don't know anything about medical imaging or general knowledge of what MRI actually is.  And if that's you, remember that this is fiction and sabotage, not an inherent danger in the technology.",4,"Well done, with a final surprise twist",1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,1982,"['movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'thriller/mystery', 'final', 'twist', 'end', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'adequately', 'foreshadowed', 'are', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'sense', 'new', 'light', 'slightly', 'unsatisfying', 'was', 'tacked', 'end', 'rather', 'building', 'towards', 'really', 'movie', 'central', 'idea', 'MRI', 'machine', 'can', 'kill', 'people', 'due', 'malicious', 'code', 'inserted', 'firmware', 'drone', 'virus', 'refers', 'computer', 'virus', 'PCs', 'become', 'zombies', 'due', 'bidding', 'controller', 'problem', 'unsecured', 'Windows', 'PCs', 'real', 'life', 'malware', 'here', 'not', 'virus', 'allow', 'remote', 'operation', 'case', 'fry', 'patient', 'brains.So', 'how', 'MRI', 'fry', 'someone', 'brain', 'making', 'kind', 'unknown', 'seizure', 'say', 'repeatedly', 'radiation', 'Well', 'MRI', ""n't"", 'involve', 'radiation', 'kind', 'rather', 'big', 'magnet', 'align', 'water', 'molecules', 'body', 'when', 'field', 'switched', 'molecules', 'swing', 'back', 'emitting', 'very', 'faint', 'signal', 'picked', 'up', 'machine', 'radio', 'frequency', 'used', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'radiation', 'not', 'ionizing', 'radiation', 'meaning', ""n't"", 'knock', 'things', 'loose', 'molecules', 'body', ""n't"", 'cause', 'damage', 'whatsoever', 'only', 'risks', 'involve', 'flying', 'metal', 'objects', 'getting', 'too', 'hot.I', 'worry', 'will', 'only', 'create', 'fear', 'machine', 'perfectly', 'safe', 'perhaps', 'symptom', 'such', 'misplaced', 'fear', 'already', 'general', 'population', 'Perhaps', 'book', 'was', 'better', 'more', 'technically', 'plausible', 'movie', 'messed', 'up', 'many', 'movies', 'days', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'computers', 'case', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'medical', 'imaging', 'general', 'knowledge', 'what', 'MRI', 'actually', 'remember', 'fiction', 'sabotage', 'not', 'inherent', 'danger', 'technology']",The Drone Virus
