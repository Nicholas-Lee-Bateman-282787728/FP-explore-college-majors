693037,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000633TZ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 10]","Out Cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous ""raunch"" button to be successful.  It tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor, sexual slap-stick, classic Hollywood references, and X-treme sport clips, but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement.  While I will not be generous to this film, I will begin this review by mentioning how proud I am of Out Cold.  Again, this was nowhere near a good film, but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis, I saw Out Cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous, original, and creative, but just failed miserably.  One must give credit to those films that fail while trying, because so many films today just, honestly, fail to try.  Unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films, as big boobs, beer drinking, and clich&eacute; characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture.  Out Cold aims towards a general audience that I despise.  That audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity.  Why do we, as audience members, do that?  Is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor?  While Out Cold did not begin the trend in Hollywood, it did contribute to it, and thus continuing films like Date Movie, American Wedding, and Dude, Where's My Car to plague our theaters.I think I have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of Hollywood, so let's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed.  I have to get this first one out in the open.  Why, painfully I ask this question, did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor, snowboarding, and Casablanca together in one film?  The first two matched, but the last was just pure rubbish.  Outside of an adult audience, not many children or teens would catch the classic Hollywood film reference, thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre.  Now, when the audience of Out Cold actually connect Casablanca to Out Cold, they will say lines like ""This movie is just like Out Cold"".  This makes me so angry.  If parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say, ""Out Cold took quite a bit from Casablanca"", instead of the other way around.  Casablanca needs to come first.  With that said, our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters.  Were there any?  Great question!  I didn't see any.  Instead, I saw actors reacting to certain situations.  There were no definitions to anyone.  Sure, one could argue that there were some ""characters"" with Pig Pen and Inga, but when I see these moments, I see clich&eacute;s, not characters.  Anyone can play a druggie, stoner, big-breasted woman, town idiot, and so forth, but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest.  Nothing of the sort happened here.  Jason London was horrid as the title character, and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as Illinois.  Jason's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and Lee Majors walked on set, said his lines, and walked off.  Again, there was nothing of value.  Nobody went beyond the lines on their script, which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film.If I were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of David Koechner, of whom I cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth.  He is the prime example of what I was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers.  He was a unique character for Bull Mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film, if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead.  Yet, I do not blame the cast for it all, the filmmakers (the Malloy brothers) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film, or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience.  As you may or may not have noticed, they went with the latter.  The entire ""King of the Mountain"" bit was horrendous, not because of the storyline element, but the fact that everyone's beer was flying, nobody recognized anyone, and only the characters we were familiar with were winners.  Just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits Bull Mountain.  The funniest bit that I think the Malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk.  The first one with the polar bear was not funny (rather juvenile), but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face.  It was this type of humor that I was expecting the entire film, but overall continued to keep falling short.Overall, Out Cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom.  Sure, there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at, but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public.  I am tired of this tween genre of film, and while I know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie, I am still tired of it.  It is as if most directors are just using the ""cut & paste"" feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success, but over time, they just become boring.  Again, I will say that of most of the films in this genre, Out Cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold, but in the end it was nothing spectacular.  I don't think I could muster the strength to watch it again.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Did I ever tell you about the time I invented snowboarding?,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,5585,"['Cold', 'hard',

It has some laughs, some big ones even, but most of the laughs are cheep and the film itself just feels rather lazy and forgettable.  Some of the snowboarding scenes are neat and exciting, but overall they don't validate the film's popularity (is it popular?).  Some of the gags are far too obvious, and the whole `Casablanca' homage just doesn't work, at all.  That said, see the movie, and I'll tell you why.  For all of those critics (and movie goers) who think they are so smart because they noticed who hilarious Zach Galifianakis was in `The Hangover' and want to label him the next big thing, back in 2001 I was tooting his horn!

His character ends the movie in an upside-down porta-john stuck in a tree. I wish I could find something better about his role elsewhere in the movie, but I can't. He plays an unlikeable character who is never really an effective villain. He's out to remake an Alaska ski resort to make it a more classy place, while the employees there fight to preserve the place's more earthy roots. Don't get me wrong; I'm a fan of a good many irreverent farces, from the better Farrely Brothers movies to SAVING SILVERMAN to JAY AND SILENT BOB. But this movie just doesn't work.

Apparently music video veterans Brendan and Emmett Malloy, whose debut film, Out Cold, practically drips the kind of nonsensical stupidity that made movies like Hot Dog... The Movie famous - if, by famous, you mean cult classics.  The previews basically say it all: a bunch of permanently-sodden snowboarders do stupid stuff, cool tricks, and have a hell of a lot of fun, while producing laughs aplenty.See, there's this guy, Rick (Jason London, To Wong Foo), a snowboarder and instructor in the tiny Alaskan hamlet of Bull Mountain.  Bull Mountain is basically the kind of place where you can go and do whatever the hell you want, a Dionysian Cicely where Rick has surrounded himself with friends Anthony (Flex Alexander, She's All That), Luke (Zach Galifianakis, Corky Romano), Pigpen (Derek Hamilton, Disturbing Behavior) and Lance (David Denman, The Replacements).  Rick wants to date Jenny (A.J. Cook, The Virgin Suicides), but can't seem to get over a fling he had with a Lolita-like girl he met in Cancun (Caroline Dhavernas, Lost and Delirious).When real-estate developer John Majors (Lee Majors, the Colonel from ""The Six Million Dollar Man"") shows up to turn the town into a yuppie haven of sushi bars, espresso machines, and Porsches with chains on the tires, Rick and company realize it spells the death of their happy-go-lucky lifestyle and decide that freedom is more important than yuppie dollars.  They then devise an Animal House plan to get their town back.  Along the way, the humor ranges from slapstick (getting your male parts caught in a Jacuzzi) to satire (some excellent semi-spoof scenes from Casablanca, Fight Club, and Gladiator) to Cheech and Chong-style bong jokes.  Yes, there's something in this film for everyone, and if you can't at least find one of the stupid things that goes on in Out Cold to laugh about, you might to check your pulse and thaw yourself out a bit.We had better get used to this `Tween Time for the next few years - the time between when the most recent Harry Potter film debuts and the next Lord of the Rings installment hits theatres.  Studios are rolling out their lowest-rung fare to try and scrape a few bucks away from the approximately 40 American moviegoers who won't be at those movies.  The problem is that Out Cold got nestled in with the rest of the tripe, and is going to get far less attention than it probably deserves.

693079,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0000633TZ,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 0]","""Out Cold"" should be a terrible, terrible movie.  Made for a shoe-string budget (what little money they had was obviously spent on pop soundtrack licensing rights and helicopter guys for extreme snowboarding shots) and with absolutely no ambitions whatsoever other than to bring a few laughs, this movie should have ended up in two-star, $2.99-bin territory.Problem is, the darn thing is funny.Loosely (and humorously) based on the immortal ""Casablanca,"" ""Out Cold"" is a classic retread of various ""Spring Break""-type movies, set on the ski slopes of ""Bull Mountain.""  The usual group of horny guys who just wanna have fun have to stick it to the man who wants to go corporate with their treasured home.  If there's an original plot line in this movie, I've yet to find it.But what the movie does have is some flat-out funny stuff.  Ever hang out with one of those guys who doesn't tell great jokes or anything, and yet he's always got people laughing around him?  That's ""Out Cold.""The under-rated Jason London plays Rick, head of the local snowboarders/stoners.  He's got three good buddies and a local gal who's quietly gorgeous and perfect for him.  But he pines for Anna (stand-in for Ilsa from ""Casablanca"") with whom he shared a great spring break in Cancun.  And Anna ""miraculously"" shows up in Bull Mountain as the daughter of the semi-evil Lee Majors, essentially playing himself as the corporate guy eager to bring sushi and black ties to this blue-collar Alaskan ski town.You can tell a lot from the cover of ""Out Cold"" - you've got sophomoric sex and alcohol related humor, a stereotypical blonde bombshell just too eager to drop her top (former Playmate Victoria Silvstedt), and some pretty good snowboarding action.Perhaps it's because the movie's PG-13 and doesn't go for the uber-gross-out humor that would have landed an R rating, but there's some surprising wit to this movie.

At least, it doesn't try to pretend to be what it is not, and that's a great virtue, for a start.And some people think it is just all about snowboarding young boys and girls fooling around, loving, fighting, drinking beer, which is very true.  The film has an ""American Pie"" or ""Porkies"" atomosphere, filled with a bunch of gags, visually and verbally.  True, many of them are not funny; and true, some of them are what you think funny when you are drunk, but later regret of having said aloud before your friends.  One of the characters (Jason London) is named Rick, and naturally, he encounters his old girl-friend (French, of course) in a bar in ""Casablanca"" fashion.  And one of the character utters a line directly from ""Gladiator,"" saying ""At my signal, unleash the hell"" before throwing snowballs.  Oh, dear.For all these stupid things, or because of these stupid things, ""Out Cold"" becomes a likable comedy.  Many of the characters are cardboard-made, but all are mildly pleasing, and among them Zach Galifianakis (""Corky Romano"") stands out for his silly, silly behaviors.  And these stupid gags should not diminish the great stunts played by real professional snowboarders like Devun Walsh, Tara Dakides, Rob Sluggo Boyce, and others.  Their works well deserve the name of professionals.""Out Cold"" is an agreeable comedy, if nothing more.

Here I was, sitting in the back row, wondering why no one would see a movie celebrating an all American winter sport.  My queries were answered halfway through the movie.  Where the famous saying goes ""Don't believe everything you see on TV"", comes this, ""Don't believe everything you see in movie trailers"". (Touchstone, you have really done it this time!)Snowboarders beware!  Whatever you have seen in the trailers depicting your favorite sport, rest assured they are all that you have seen as far as this movie goes.  So to fill up the remaining 90 minutes, the Malloy Brothers and company have put together a messy sandwich of borrowed plot ideas.  The ingredients are as follows:- 1 Lee Majors as wealthy businessman coming to a snowy town to buy the entire town- 5 warm-blooded ""American Pie""-type males epitomizing young male stereotypes-&gt; 1 Jason London as handsome clean-cut hopeless romantic Rick-&gt; 1 Derek Hamilton as complete idiot Pigpen (Inspiration: Looney Tunes!)-&gt; 1 Zach Galifianakis as resident butt-of-all-the-slapstick-jokes Luke-&gt; 1 David Denman as ambiguously gay bartender Lance-&gt; 1 Flex Alexander as token African-American Anthony- 3 stereotypically diverse women-&gt; 1 A.J. Cook as Jenny the jilted, lover of boys-&gt; 1 Caroline Dhavernas as Anna the engaged, the romantic snare-&gt; 1 Playboy playmate Victoria Silvstedt for sexual titillation- 1 romance storyline straight from ""Casablanca"" involving Rick and Anna- over 100 racy humor materials paralleling ""Road Trip""- several snowboarding scenes (by accomplished snoboarders) so that it will be promoted as a snowboarding movieMix them together.  Never mind how, as long as they are mixed together.That is exactly what ""Out Cold"" delivers.  When the opening is presented by a scruffy-looking redneck-talking lunatic on the subject of a snowy mountainous town in Alaska founded by a flamboyant whacko who enjoys pulling his own pants down while skiing, it pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie.  However, the choke full of comedy is not enough to eliminate the aftertaste of bad casting.  Majors is clearly a fish out of water, he does not have a clue with his role.  Though he makes a good effort calling the founder's son `retard', which only goes to show he needs a foil character to play off.  He can't do a scene on his own.  Equally clueless is Silvstedt's turn as his stepdaugter from a Swede mother.  Despite her actual Swedish background, she is spoofing her native accent for some strange reason.  It would have been better off if her character was non-speaking.  Dhavernas is a pain to watch.  It is one thing to borrow an idea from ""Casablanca"", but to have an inexperienced actress reproduce Ingrid Bergman's role from that film is ludicrous. (Does anyone really believe that she is sorry for standing up Rick?!) It is a relief that London does not return ala Humphrey Bogart.  Pigpen is a stinkbomb, Hamilton is a stinker.  His role's only purpose is to play out his daydream of crashing into a cable car full of Solid Gold dancers.  Other than that, he is plain irritating.  Possibly the only good acting comes from Galifianakis, who sells every pranks and slapstick routines his character receives.  A pity that he is surrounded by bad actors and a screenplay of borrowed plot ideas that do not mesh together.To be absolutely clear, ""Out Cold"" is NOT about snowboarding.  Nor is it about Major's attempted takeover of a quiet snowy town somewhere in Alaska.  It is about making another silly movie, and one that feels Out Cold.",1,Out Cold indeed!,1007424000,"12 4, 2001",2001,3657,"['funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'was', 'movie', 'theater', 'watching', 'Cold', 'theater', 'was', 'empty', 'Here', 'was', 'sitting', 'back', 'row', 'wondering', 'why', 'one', 'would', 'see', 'movie', 'celebrating', 'American', 'winter', 'sport', 'queries', 'were', 'answered', 'halfway', 'movie', 'Where', 'famous', 'saying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'everything', 'see', 'TV', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'everything', 'see', 'movie', 'trailers', 'Touchstone', 'have', 'really', 'done', 'time', 'Snowboarders', 'beware', 'have', 'seen', 'trailers', 'depicting', 'favorite', 'sport', 'rest', 'assured', 'are', 'have', 'seen', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'So', 'fill', 'up', 'remaining', '90', 'minutes', 'Malloy', 'Brothers', 'company', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'messy', 'sandwich', 'borrowed', 'plot', 'ideas', 'ingredients', 'are', '1', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'coming', 'snowy', 'town', 'buy', 'entire', 'town-', '5', 'warm-blooded', 'American', 'Pie', '-type', 'males', 'epitomizing', 'young', 'male', 'stereotypes-', 'gt', '1', 'Jason', 'London', 'handsome', 'clean-cut', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'Rick-', 'gt', '1', 'Derek', 'Hamilton', 'complete', 'idiot', 'Pigpen', 'Inspiration', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'gt', '1', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'resident', 'butt-of-all-the-slapstick-jokes', 'Luke-', 'gt', '1', 'David', 'Denman', 'ambiguously', 'gay', 'bartender', 'Lance-', 'gt', '1', 'Flex', 'Alexander', 'token', 'African-American', 'Anthony-', '3', 'stereotypically', 'diverse', 'women-', 'gt', '1', 'A.J', 'Cook', 'Jenny', 'jilted', 'lover', 'boys-', 'gt', '1', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'Anna', 'engaged', 'romantic', 'snare-', 'gt', '1', 'Playboy', 'playmate', 'Victoria', 'Silvstedt', 'sexual', 'titillation-', '1', 'romance', 'storyline', 'straight', 'Casablanca', 'involving', 'Rick', 'Anna-', '100', 'racy', 'humor', 'materials', 'paralleling', 'Road', 'Trip', 'several', 'snowboarding', 'scenes', 'accomplished', 'snoboarders', 'will', 'be', 'promoted', 'snowboarding', 'movieMix', 'together', 'Never', 'mind', 'how', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'mixed', 'together.That', 'exactly', 'what', 'Out', 'Cold', 'delivers', 'When', 'opening', 'presented', 'scruffy-looking', 'redneck-talking', 'lunatic', 'subject', 'snowy', 'mountainous', 'town', 'Alaska', 'founded', 'flamboyant', 'whacko', 'who', 'pulling', 'own', 'pants', 'down', 'skiing', 'pretty', 'much', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie', 'However', 'choke', 'full', 'comedy', 'not', 'enough', 'eliminate', 'aftertaste', 'bad', 'casting', 'Majors', 'clearly', 'fish', 'water', 'not', 'have', 'clue', 'role', 'good', 'effort', 'calling', 'founder', 'son', 'retard', 'only', 'show', 'foil', 'character', 'play', 'off', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'scene', 'own', 'Equally', 'clueless', 'Silvstedt', 'turn', 'stepdaugter', 'Swede', 'mother', 'actual', 'Swedish', 'background', 'spoofing', 'native', 'accent', 'strange', 'reason', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'character', 'was', 'non-speaking', 'Dhavernas', 'pain', 'watch', 'one', 'thing', 'borrow', 'idea', 'Casablanca', 'have', 'inexperienced', 'actress', 'reproduce', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'role', 'film', 'ludicrous', 'Does', 'anyone', 'really', 'believe', 'sorry', 'standing', 'up', 'Rick', 'relief', 'London', 'not', 'return', 'ala', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Pigpen', 'stinkbomb', 'Hamilton', 'stinker', 'role', 'only', 'purpose', 'play', 'out', 'daydream', 'crashing', 'cable', 'car', 'full', 'Solid', 'Gold', 'dancers', 'Other', 'plain', 'irritating', 'Possibly', 'only', 'good', 'acting', 'Galifianakis', 'who', 'pranks', 'slapstick', 'routines', 'character', 'receives', 'pity', 'surrounded', 'bad', 'actors', 'screenplay', 'borrowed', 'plot', 'ideas', 'do', 'not', 'mesh', 'together.To', 'be', 'absolutely', 'clear', 'Cold', 'NOT', 'snowboarding', 'Major', 'attempted', 'takeover', 'quiet', 'snowy', 'town', 'somewhere', 'Alaska', 'making', 'silly', 'movie', 'one', 'Out', 'Cold']",N/A
