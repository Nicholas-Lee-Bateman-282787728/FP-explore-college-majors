1206901,A17PNW5KFXRDT3,B001JV5B08,fsnva,"[2, 2]","Balls out: Gary the Tennis Coach, is the perfect kind of gross out comedy that gets better with repeated viewings.  At first it might be a little off putting, but once you get the movie's vibe, it's easy to go with.  One potential problem is the character of Gary, played by Sean William Scott, who comes off as almost psychotic in some parts; this is one of those movies, like Cable Guy, that is centered around an unstable lead.  Also, the plot, what there is of it, is the usual sports underdogs and losers trying to become champions cliche we've seen many times, but this is no Mighty Ducks, there is plenty of bathroom humor (taking a dump and puking), really dirty talk (a very foul mouthed little girl), racist jokes (directed at Asians), and plenty of good old bad taste. If you're easily offended, then consider yourself warned. I think this is the perfect movie when you want to do nothing more than kick back and laugh at the same dumb joke over and over.  If you are a Randy Quaid fan, you may be disappointed, as his role is relatively brief; is this the last movie he made before going cuckoo for coco puffs?

1206903,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001JV5B08,Jason,"[1, 1]","Gary (Sean William Scott) is a complete imbecile - think Joe Dirt with a tennis fetish.  He even ends up as a janitor; excuse me, custodial engineer like Mr. Dir'te.  What he lacks, however, is the Joe Dirt mantra, ""Life's a garden, dig it.""15-Love (Promising, albeit undeveloped start)Born into a tennis family but never really given a chance to nurture the talent because of a psychologically abusive father, Gary yearns for on-court success.  Throughout his early life he faces constant failure.  When he realizes his life on the pathetic, amateur, Mexican tennis league is leading nowhere, he finally gives up the boyhood dream.  From there he ends up huffing paint, but quickly rebounds to being a school janitor.30-Love (Here comes the craziness)After buying an RV, he meets up with a sad-sack, high school tennis team led by apathetic Randy Quaid.  When Quaid bites the bullet, it's up to Ryan to take over (you recognize this formula because it's the same one from Bad News Bears, Might Ducks, Varsity Blues, etc.).30-15 (Yawn)Puke/purge joke.  Butt joke.  Butt in jock strap.  Kids scared of tennis balls being hit by tennis balls to overcome fear (ahem, Goldberg, Mighty Ducks), tennis jargon nobody recognizes.30-30 (Cringe-worthy)Ahhh...here comes the strippers, booze, hot Spanish teacher, classic Stiffler behaviorism, disgusting dog behavior, and the most foul-mouthed little girl in cinema history.  Actually, the little girl (Ryan Simpkins) steals every scene with her delusional, hypochondriac routine about drugs, hookers, AIDS, and abortions.  It's over the top crass, ridiculous, and disturbingly funny.40-30 (Exactly what I expected)Wow, does it ever get predictable and boring.  The younger actors unfortunately get more screen time.  A few teenage sap scenes.  A horribly unfunny scene of an Indian themed hallucination.  Predictable is good as long as it's funny.40-40 (Deuce - disappointingly boring)I bet you can't guess who wins the state championships!40-Advantage (As if you didn't see it coming)What the F did that little girl say?  Apparently, she has all the aforementioned problems, but also suffers from fecalogical Tourettes.  Her line will make 99% of viewers gasp, and some snicker.  I snickered, but still can't believe it.If this movie proves anything, it's that Scott can't really carry a movie solo.  He's good for a few laughs, a random awkward scene, but he's more of a doubles player.
