490485,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000003KHQ,Alex Udvary,"[14, 17]","What happens when you combine Neil Simon and Walter Matthau? You get this hilarious remake from a Neil Simon play! Matthau is just absolutely amazing  to watch, going from one character to another! He proves his status as an  &quot;A&quot; list actor. The story concerns Matthau playing three roles.  Each just happens to be staying at the same room in the same hotel, at of  course, separate times. And offers three different and unique stories for  each situation. Of the three skits, I prefer the third sketch. Sure, many  say the first one is better, but it's more sentimental then the three,  which is exactly what it's suppose to be. But the reason I chose the third  one is because, it's simply the funniest of the three. And when I watch a  Neil Simon film, I expect pleny of laughs. And the third one offers them.  Wonderful performances by all the supporting women. Many think Mauren  Stapleton was the best off all three, she was in the &quot;first act&quot;,  playing Matthau's wife, who learns something terrible about her husband.  And no, I'm not going to tell you. Barbara Harris is quite good in her  performances as Murie Tate, Matthau's ex-wife, whom he calls over to his  hotel room for some &quot;fun&quot;, is you know what I mean. And last but  not least, we have Lee Grant and Matthau play Mr. and Mrs. Hubley, who are  having a hell of a time trying to get their daughter, who is having second  doubts about the marriage, out of their hotel bathroom, so she can make her  wedding! Unbelieveable chaos insues, and is a pure delight to watch.  Unfortunatley Matthau wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor,  what proves, that the Academy always makes some sort of mistake. Plus, the  screenplay written by Simon wasn't up for Best Adapted Screenplay. One of  Simon's best! If you enjoy this movie other Matthau &amp; Simon films are:  &quot;The Odd Couple 1&amp; 2&quot;, and &quot;California Suite&quot;.",3,Tour-De-Force For Matthau!,969321600,"09 19, 2000",2000,1938,"['What', 'when', 'combine', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'get', 'hilarious', 'remake', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'play', 'Matthau', 'just', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'watch', 'going', 'one', 'character', 'status', 'quot', 'A', 'quot', 'list', 'actor', 'story', 'concerns', 'Matthau', 'playing', 'three', 'roles', 'just', 'be', 'staying', 'same', 'room', 'same', 'hotel', 'course', 'separate', 'times', 'three', 'different', 'unique', 'stories', 'situation', 'three', 'skits', 'prefer', 'third', 'sketch', 'Sure', 'many', 'say', 'first', 'one', 'better', 'more', 'sentimental', 'then', 'three', 'exactly', 'what', 'suppose', 'be', 'reason', 'chose', 'third', 'one', 'simply', 'funniest', 'three', 'when', 'watch', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'film', 'expect', 'pleny', 'laughs', 'third', 'one', 'Wonderful', 'performances', 'supporting', 'women', 'Many', 'think', 'Mauren', 'Stapleton', 'was', 'best', 'three', 'was', 'quot', 'first', 'act', 'quot', 'playing', 'Matthau', 'wife', 'who', 'something', 'terrible', 'husband', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'quite', 'good', 'performances', 'Murie', 'Tate', 'Matthau', 'ex-wife', 'whom', 'hotel', 'room', 'quot', 'fun', 'quot', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'have', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'Matthau', 'play', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Hubley', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'hell', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'daughter', 'who', 'having', 'second', 'doubts', 'marriage', 'hotel', 'bathroom', 'can', 'make', 'wedding', 'Unbelieveable', 'chaos', 'insues', 'pure', 'delight', 'watch', 'Unfortunatley', 'Matthau', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'what', 'Academy', 'always', 'sort', 'mistake', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Simon', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'One', 'Simon', 'best', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'other', 'Matthau', 'amp', 'Simon', 'films', 'are', 'quot', 'Odd', 'Couple', '1', 'amp', '2', 'quot', 'quot', 'California', 'Suite', 'quot']",Plaza Suite VHS
490486,A2SIYUWT6H8B0G,B000003KHQ,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Yes, it was OK;  Walter Matthau is always entertaining to watch, but, although I watched the whole movie, I have mixed feelings about the subject matters.  Jean Stapleton made the first act my favorite one with her superb acting.  She lived her roles in a way few actors do anymore by truly becoming the characters she played; here she IS the slighted wife and you can feel her confusion, her desperation, her hesitation to stand up for herself, then going back on her own words when she does.  First act definitely the best of these three acts; second and third OK, although, in the second one, the married woman who is so easily manipulated by the now famous old boyfriend, is an interesting study in how some people throw away or destroy their lives when they hear the things they want to hear.  The woman's gullibility is masterfully depicted in the manner Matthau's character makes her do exactly what he wants her to; of course, he is only after sex for the night.  We are led to believe he gets it, and then drops his old girlfriend since she so obviously means nothing to him.  Blinded by his manipulation, she does not catch on because of how much he means to her; she has kept up on all kinds of details of his now famous life, creating a dream about being with him which has helped her endure her own bad life and marriage.  The third act is silly, but funny; it is a typical Matthau act, although he also had the ability to play more serious parts, like in the first act.  Actually, all three acts show how superb an actor he was.",4,Mixed bag...,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,1542,"['Yes', 'was', 'OK', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'always', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'watched', 'whole', 'movie', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'subject', 'matters', 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'made', 'first', 'act', 'favorite', 'one', 'superb', 'acting', 'lived', 'roles', 'way', 'few', 'actors', 'do', 'anymore', 'truly', 'becoming', 'characters', 'played', 'here', 'slighted', 'wife', 'can', 'feel', 'confusion', 'desperation', 'hesitation', 'stand', 'up', 'then', 'going', 'back', 'own', 'words', 'when', 'First', 'act', 'definitely', 'best', 'three', 'acts', 'second', 'third', 'OK', 'second', 'one', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'now', 'famous', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'interesting', 'study', 'how', 'people', 'throw', 'away', 'destroy', 'lives', 'when', 'hear', 'things', 'want', 'hear', 'woman', 'gullibility', 'masterfully', 'depicted', 'manner', 'Matthau', 'character', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'course', 'only', 'sex', 'night', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'then', 'drops', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'obviously', 'nothing', 'Blinded', 'manipulation', 'not', 'catch', 'how', 'much', 'kept', 'up', 'kinds', 'details', 'now', 'famous', 'life', 'creating', 'dream', 'being', 'helped', 'endure', 'own', 'bad', 'life', 'marriage', 'third', 'act', 'silly', 'funny', 'typical', 'Matthau', 'act', 'also', 'had', 'ability', 'play', 'more', 'serious', 'parts', 'first', 'act', 'Actually', 'three', 'acts', 'show', 'how', 'actor', 'was']",Plaza Suite VHS

490490,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000003KHQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 4]","If you want a mildly entertaining snapshot of what made Walter Matthau such a skilled curmudgeon of an actor, you should take a look at this 1971 three-act Neil Simon comedy directed in a fairly pedestrian manner by Arthur Hiller. Based on Simon's Broadway hit, it feels very stagy with reams of dialogue and for the most part, a recreation of Suite 719 at the Plaza Hotel as the movie's only set.  There is a central conceit in casting Matthau as the male lead in all three mini-plays, but fortunately the three characters suitably fit the contours of his talent. It also helps that Hiller cast three superb, relatively unsung actresses opposite him.In the first and most dramatic piece, Matthau plays Sam Nash, a preoccupied, workaholic husband who sees his youth slipping away as he celebrates his 23rd (or 24th) wedding anniversary at the Plaza. Played by the wonderfully earthy Maureen Stapleton, his somewhat absent-minded wife Karen comes to realize that Sam is having an affair. Stapleton is really center stage here and performs superbly as she gradually realizes her anniversary celebration is unraveling into a much-too-delayed discussion of the true state of their marriage. The second mini-play is a light farce with Matthau playing self-absorbed Hollywood producer Jesse Kiplinger. Sporting an unflattering 1970's blonde wig and affecting a saucy, faux-hip accent, he is hilariously on the make for his former hometown flame, Muriel Tate, now a New Jersey housewife. The underappreciated Barbara Harris has an appropriate showcase for her spacey, improvisational flair as Muriel, especially as she asks about her favorite movie stars at the most inopportune times during his less-than-subtle seduction.Probably because of its frenetic pace, broad characterizations and physical comedy, the last act is the funniest of the three with Matthau and Lee Grant playing Roy and Norma Hubley, who are desperately trying to talk their hesitant daughter out of a locked bathroom just minutes before her wedding. Their rat-a-tat chemistry is priceless as they encounter every possible mishap with Grant especially hilarious as Norma in simmering panic with her palpitations and torn stockings. As a whole, there is no getting away from the fact that the movie feels like a filmed stage play, but Simon's dialogue is crisp and insightful and the actors so expert that it is worth viewing. Sadly there are no extras with the 2003 DVD.",4,Curmudgeonly Matthau and Three Superb Actresses Keep Neil Simon's Three-Act Comedy Aloft,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,2435,"['want', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'snapshot', 'what', 'made', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'skilled', 'curmudgeon', 'actor', 'should', 'take', 'look', '1971', 'three-act', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'comedy', 'directed', 'fairly', 'pedestrian', 'manner', 'Arthur', 'Hiller', 'Based', 'Simon', 'Broadway', 'hit', 'very', 'stagy', 'reams', 'dialogue', 'most', 'part', 'recreation', 'Suite', '719', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 'movie', 'only', 'set', 'central', 'conceit', 'casting', 'Matthau', 'male', 'lead', 'three', 'mini-plays', 'fortunately', 'three', 'characters', 'suitably', 'fit', 'contours', 'talent', 'also', 'Hiller', 'cast', 'three', 'superb', 'relatively', 'unsung', 'actresses', 'opposite', 'first', 'most', 'dramatic', 'piece', 'Matthau', 'Sam', 'Nash', 'preoccupied', 'workaholic', 'husband', 'who', 'youth', 'slipping', 'away', '23rd', '24th', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'Plaza', 'Played', 'wonderfully', 'earthy', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'somewhat', 'absent-minded', 'wife', 'Karen', 'realize', 'Sam', 'having', 'affair', 'Stapleton', 'really', 'center', 'stage', 'here', 'superbly', 'gradually', 'anniversary', 'celebration', 'unraveling', 'much-too-delayed', 'discussion', 'true', 'state', 'marriage', 'second', 'mini-play', 'light', 'farce', 'Matthau', 'playing', 'self-absorbed', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'Jesse', 'Kiplinger', 'Sporting', 'unflattering', '1970', 'blonde', 'wig', 'affecting', 'saucy', 'faux-hip', 'accent', 'hilariously', 'make', 'former', 'hometown', 'flame', 'Muriel', 'Tate', 'now', 'New', 'Jersey', 'housewife', 'underappreciated', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'appropriate', 'showcase', 'spacey', 'improvisational', 'flair', 'Muriel', 'especially', 'favorite', 'movie', 'stars', 'most', 'inopportune', 'times', 'less-than-subtle', 'seduction.Probably', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'broad', 'characterizations', 'physical', 'comedy', 'last', 'act', 'funniest', 'three', 'Matthau', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'playing', 'Roy', 'Norma', 'Hubley', 'who', 'are', 'desperately', 'trying', 'talk', 'hesitant', 'daughter', 'locked', 'bathroom', 'just', 'minutes', 'wedding', 'rat-a-tat', 'chemistry', 'priceless', 'encounter', 'possible', 'mishap', 'Grant', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'Norma', 'simmering', 'panic', 'palpitations', 'torn', 'stockings', 'whole', 'getting', 'away', 'fact', 'movie', 'feels', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'Simon', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'insightful', 'actors', 'so', 'expert', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Sadly', 'are', 'extras', '2003', 'DVD']",Plaza Suite VHS

The premise is that the entire play takes place in on suite of a hotel.  In this it was Suite 719 of NYC's Plaza Hotel.  Each of the three acts has two main characters.  On stage, the same two actors played all three acts.  In the film, Walter Matthau plays the male lead but three different women play opposite him, Maureen Stapleton, Barbara Harris and Lee Grant.Visitors From New York -It is the Nash's 24th Wedding Anniversary.  Karen (Stapleton) wants everything to be perfect.  She has reserved the same room as on their wedding night.  The only problem is her husband Sam doesn't care.  And he's having an affair with his secretary.Maureen Stapleton has always been a great character actress.  She would perfect the harried wife to perfection  Her natural warmth and charm always makes her likeable to the audience.Visitor From Hollywood -Jesse Kiplinger is a Hollywood producer who is in New York for the opening of his new film.  He has a couple of hours to fill and he is looking up an old flame from high school, Muriel (Harris).  Muriel is happily married but she is star struck.  All she wants to do is say that she was with a famous Hollywood producer, not that she slept with him just spent the afternoon. (Remember this was the 60's).  Jesse tries but Muriel resists until he talks about the stars.Barbara Harris has perfect comic timing, even when she does dramatic roles.  She also is not afraid of physical comedy.  In this she combines both perfectly and works off of Matthau with ease.Visitors From Brooklyn -Roy and Norma (Grant) Hubley's daughter is getting married today.  That is if they can get her out of bathroom.  This is pure Simon farce.Lee Grant has proven she can do anything but all out farce is her forte.  No one does a woman on the verge better.Walter Matthau was a high profile character actor.  That is until he and Jack Lemmon met up with Neil Simon.  The Odd Couple permanently moved Walter to leading actor status.  Therefore, when the next Simon project was ready for filming, that Matthau was the first choice.  Walter had three very different characters to play here and he does each to perfection.This is master class in comedy, not only acting but directing and writing.DVD EXTRAS: None",4,How Suite it is,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,2298,"['Plaza', 'Suite', 'was', 'first', 'three', 'Suite', 'plays', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'premise', 'entire', 'play', 'place', 'suite', 'hotel', 'was', 'Suite', '719', 'NYC', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 'three', 'acts', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'stage', 'same', 'two', 'actors', 'played', 'three', 'acts', 'film', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'male', 'lead', 'three', 'different', 'women', 'play', 'opposite', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'Lee', 'Grant.Visitors', 'From', 'New', 'York', '-It', 'Nash', '24th', 'Wedding', 'Anniversary', 'Karen', 'Stapleton', 'everything', 'be', 'perfect', 'reserved', 'same', 'room', 'wedding', 'night', 'only', 'problem', 'husband', 'Sam', ""n't"", 'care', 'having', 'affair', 'secretary.Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'character', 'actress', 'would', 'perfect', 'harried', 'wife', 'perfection', 'Her', 'natural', 'warmth', 'charm', 'always', 'likeable', 'audience.Visitor', 'Hollywood', '-Jesse', 'Kiplinger', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'opening', 'new', 'film', 'couple', 'hours', 'fill', 'looking', 'up', 'old', 'flame', 'high', 'school', 'Muriel', 'Harris', 'Muriel', 'happily', 'married', 'star', 'struck', 'do', 'say', 'was', 'famous', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'not', 'slept', 'just', 'spent', 'afternoon', 'Remember', 'was', '60', 'Jesse', 'tries', 'Muriel', 'stars.Barbara', 'Harris', 'perfect', 'comic', 'timing', 'even', 'when', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'also', 'not', 'afraid', 'physical', 'comedy', 'perfectly', 'Matthau', 'ease.Visitors', 'Brooklyn', '-Roy', 'Norma', 'Grant', 'Hubley', 'daughter', 'getting', 'married', 'today', 'can', 'get', 'bathroom', 'pure', 'Simon', 'farce.Lee', 'Grant', 'proven', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'out', 'farce', 'forte', 'one', 'woman', 'verge', 'better.Walter', 'Matthau', 'was', 'high', 'profile', 'character', 'actor', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'met', 'up', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'permanently', 'moved', 'Walter', 'leading', 'actor', 'status', 'Therefore', 'when', 'next', 'Simon', 'project', 'was', 'ready', 'filming', 'Matthau', 'was', 'first', 'choice', 'Walter', 'had', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'play', 'here', 'perfection.This', 'master', 'class', 'comedy', 'not', 'only', 'acting', 'directing', 'writing.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",Plaza Suite VHS

Even 35 years ago, I think the stories of adultery and seduction were unoriginal. The last story, however, is a non-stop laugh session.

And in this case, with his daughter locked in the Plaza's bathroom on the day of her wedding, the penny-pinching Matthau erupts over and again.
