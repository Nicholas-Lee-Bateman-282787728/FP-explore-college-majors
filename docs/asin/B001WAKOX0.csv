1244800,A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B001WAKOX0,"Chandler ""Infamous""","[2, 3]","Tyler Perry's latest installment theatrical movie Madea Goes To Jail was pretty much okay. The acting was pretty much straight forward, especially Mr. Perry playing an old female convict, Madea. I don't get to watch his movies very often (the last I saw wasWhy Did I Get Married? (Widescreen Edition), so I really don't know the full background behind all of his movies nor screen plays.Pros: All acting was great. The movie casting was great. Especially Derek Luke's character, playing the good guy here in this movie. Mr. Perry playing Madea (as well as a lawyer). Some of it is funny how you find an elderly woman acting like a 20 year old, making sarcastic jokes throughout the movie.Cons: I asked the title in my review because I was under the impression that this was a comedy, but it would jump back and forth between comedy and drama. Madea is the star of this movie, but the majority focus was on Keyshia Knight Pulliam's character ""Candy"" and her life as a prostitute, and Derek Luke's character trying his hardest to help her out, which is were the drama comes in. I really hate that when there is more than one plot going on in a movie and they're unrelated to each other. At times its like watching two separate movies here. Also I thought that this movie was very predictable with cameos. Example: Former TV Divorce Court Judge Mablean Ephriam Esq plays a judge on here. When they said a new judge was taking over Madea's case, I saw Judge Mathis making an appearance from a mile away.Overall this movie was okay, but not great. I guess this is more geared towards an older crowd, more than some young twenty-something year old trying to gain benefit from watching this. Just know that it is not all Madea here in this movie. There are some funny parts and there are some dramatic parts into this movie. To get the full enjoyment out of this movie, you will have to follow both plots here (it's not so hard toward the end though). I don't think it's worth your 9 bucks to see this movie.

1244806,ALGDCIFQZYMH9,B001WAKOX0,Cookbook Collector,"[5, 9]","I found this movie to be a sad insight into Tyler Perry's world view. The movie claims to be about not being a victim - but that is exactly what I think Tyler Perry's message in this movie is. I think this movie sends the wrong message about all people getting along - no matter what color God made them! The 'pimp' is either a white or very light colored Hispanic male and says to the black prositute that he wants her to be his 'slave'. The white lady that parks in the spot Madea wants at the Super K Mart refers to Madea as 'Jememia'. The white 'Christian' businessman (with his wedding ring on and photos of his children behind him) that the black female pastor enlists to help get prostitues off the streets and into jobs is shown to be a criminal that only gives the girls jobs if they sleep with him. In the prision, the blond haired-blue eyed Scandanavian looking inmate is an aggresive-violent homosexual - especially toward the young black prostitute. Madea's white cellmate - also a Hispanic (assume by her accent, but they never specify) is a serial killer that acts like a crazy goodie two shoes. To top all that off - the two lighter skin toned black characters, especially the prosecuter/fiancee of the main male character are shown as the ones with no morals and willing to do wrong.Since Tyler Perry wrote this entire movie - it is evident to me that he wants to portray whites/Hispanics/and-or lighter skinned blacks as bad people with racist tendencies, in my opinion. For example - the fiance mentioned above - she calls the prostitute 'them people' 'from the other side of the tracks'. Tyler Perry is willing to show a lighter skinned accomplished black woman as the main villian by only being able to get ahead by padding her cases and wrongly sending people to jail - either at all - or for longer periods of time than is allowed. The prostitue frequently tells her long time love that this woman is 'not his type' and is a 'princess' (ie - strong implication that she is not truly a black person). I feel this should be insulting to any woman - black or white - or any color - that happens to value her education and wants to get ahead - especially any black woman (or man) that would be considered a 'traitor' for pursuing a good education, career, and life - that is considered to be a 'white' attribute.Of course, wrong is done by the female prosecutor - but the way it's portrayed and the way most of the white people are portrayed in this movie (aside from all the swearing and negative religious content) as sick, violent, or just plain racist - shows me that Tyler Perry wants to continue the division of victimhood, instead of bringing all of God's people together - as he could have done with this movie - but chose not to! God gave him an opportunity, a voice, and a platform to further this worthy goal and it saddens me he didn't take it.",1,Could have been such a good movie - but wasn't....,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,2875,"['found', 'movie', 'be', 'sad', 'insight', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'world', 'view', 'movie', 'be', 'not', 'being', 'victim', 'exactly', 'what', 'think', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'message', 'movie', 'think', 'movie', 'wrong', 'message', 'people', 'getting', 'matter', 'what', 'color', 'God', 'made', ""'pimp"", 'white', 'very', 'light', 'colored', 'Hispanic', 'male', 'black', 'prositute', 'be', ""'slave"", 'white', 'lady', 'spot', 'Madea', 'Super', 'K', 'Mart', 'Madea', ""'Jememia"", 'white', ""'Christian"", 'businessman', 'wedding', 'ring', 'photos', 'children', 'black', 'female', 'pastor', 'help', 'get', 'prostitues', 'streets', 'jobs', 'shown', 'be', 'criminal', 'only', 'girls', 'jobs', 'sleep', 'prision', 'blond', 'haired-blue', 'eyed', 'Scandanavian', 'looking', 'inmate', 'aggresive-violent', 'homosexual', 'especially', 'young', 'black', 'prostitute', 'Madea', 'white', 'cellmate', 'also', 'Hispanic', 'assume', 'accent', 'never', 'specify', 'serial', 'killer', 'crazy', 'goodie', 'two', 'shoes', 'top', 'off', 'two', 'lighter', 'skin', 'toned', 'black', 'characters', 'especially', 'prosecuter/fiancee', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'are', 'shown', 'ones', 'morals', 'willing', 'do', 'wrong.Since', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'wrote', 'entire', 'movie', 'evident', 'portray', 'whites/Hispanics/and-or', 'lighter', 'skinned', 'blacks', 'bad', 'people', 'racist', 'tendencies', 'opinion', 'example', 'fiance', 'mentioned', 'prostitute', 'people', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'willing', 'show', 'lighter', 'skinned', 'accomplished', 'black', 'woman', 'main', 'villian', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'ahead', 'padding', 'cases', 'wrongly', 'sending', 'people', 'jail', 'longer', 'periods', 'time', 'allowed', 'prostitue', 'frequently', 'long', 'time', 'love', 'woman', 'type', ""'princess"", 'ie', 'strong', 'implication', 'not', 'truly', 'black', 'person', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'insulting', 'woman', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'value', 'education', 'get', 'ahead', 'especially', 'black', 'woman', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'considered', ""'traitor"", 'pursuing', 'good', 'education', 'career', 'life', 'considered', 'be', ""'white"", 'attribute.Of', 'course', 'wrong', 'done', 'female', 'prosecutor', 'way', 'portrayed', 'way', 'most', 'white', 'people', 'are', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'aside', 'swearing', 'negative', 'religious', 'content', 'sick', 'violent', 'just', 'plain', 'racist', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'continue', 'division', 'victimhood', 'instead', 'bringing', 'God', 'people', 'together', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'movie', 'chose', 'not', 'God', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'voice', 'platform', 'further', 'worthy', 'goal', 'did', ""n't"", 'take']",Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail

1244808,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B001WAKOX0,Daddy,"[0, 0]","I should preface this review by saying that I enjoy all of Tyler Perry's movies; especially his Madea series, and that Perry is a gifted and multi-talented actor/writer/director.  However, I should also comment that his character of Madea has run its course, and this movie is perhaps the last hurrah for Madea. There are better Madea movies in his series, and Perry should have quit while he was ahead (with this movie), instead of carrying on the character in subsequent movies.  As a side note, I would like to have seen more depth put into Madea - considering the prominence of that character in so many movies.  As it stands, the character of Madea is just a bit superficial, though very funny and otherwise well crafted.  This movie is very funny, perhaps more comical than other Madea movies (i.e., Diary Of A Mad Black Woman & Madea's Family Reunion).  One drawback to any Tyler Perry Madea movie is the seemingly formulaic characters; the victimized female lead, who eventually becomes strong and independent, the sensitive and caring male counterpart who wins the heart of the aforementioned lead, the tyranical and abusive husband to the leading lady, and of course, the overbearing mother of the victimized leading lady.  Aside from the formulaic characters, this entry in the Madea series is very funny.  In this one, the leading lady is Candy (Keisha Knight Pullam), a victimized prostitute who eventually is imprisoned for a longer sentence than she deserves - because of a devious prosecutor.  Of course, Madea eventually ends up in prison, and they meet and help each other.  There are a number of cameos by celebrities.  Keisha Knight Pullam is superb in her portrayal of Candy... and her story is touching and dramatic to watch - then offset by the wacky escapades of Madea; like an event at Kmart in which Madea flips over the car of a rude customer because she took her parking spot.  There are some interesting special features on this DVD.  And the movie is a lot of fun.  If you like Madea and/or Tyler Perry; Madea Goes To Jail is the perfect movie to complete your collection.

1244817,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001WAKOX0,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","If it's about Mable ""Madea"" Simmons, I like to shoot from the hip because this character is so scatter-shot yet intensely brilliant. She reminds me of my grandmother, my aunt, my mother--and even at times my father. My wife, on the other hand, likes to loudly denounce Madea as ""that annoying Tyler Perry in a fat suit in drag."" Funnily enough, my wife greatly reminds me of Madea.Letting that pass, I loved Madea in this film, and the dramatic storyline is not bad either. We all know it: nice black guy gets screwed over by fianc&eacute; when an old flame returns. (I'm amazed this isn't some kind of ""diary"" film, like Perry's THE DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN, which inspired the documentary DIARY OF A TIRED BLACK MAN.) I'll only mention Derek Luke, who is the most adorable creature.Meanwhile, Madea is getting on with her life as best she can, and is somehow vaguely connected to the dramatic part (which reaches operatic proportions, and this angers my wife too). As she struggles, trading insults with her brother Joe (also played by Perry) and fighting with her Christian daughter Cora, the drama heats up with the other group of folks. The old flame gets tossed in jail after the assistant DA (the nasty fianc&eacute;e) trumps up charges out of jealousy.Madea ends up in front of the infamous Judge Mathis, who gives her five years. In jail, she finally comes face to face with the 'old flame', Candy, and protects her as only Madea can. Her fights with the idiotic Dr. Phil are probably the best part of this film. It had me rolling on the floor--that is, when I was not suffering through the damned drama. It's good drama but here it just spoils the screentime with Madea.By the bye, plays or no plays, this film must be considered a ""gelquel"" of Perry's delightful MEET THE BROWNS, since MADEA GOES TO JAIL because of the car chase which we witnessed throughout MEET THE BROWNS. (In that instance, as in a few others, Madea is like a half-mythical, legendary trouble-making witch, like her Greek namesake, the evil witch named Medea.) A great reviewer wrote that Madea represents the opposite of the ""soapbox"" attitude of Perry's films.Exactly: Madea the Good Alter Ego to Hypocritical Preachy Drama. She speaks her mind, fights for herself knowing no one else will, and is not afraid to pull her gun when necessary. In that respect, Madea is a one-character argument for the 2nd Amendment, and I love that.Some people have stated confusion at Madea's 'accent', which I wonder whether it is a Carolina Brogue of some kind. She often exclaims, ""Halleluyer!!"" and is most popular for uttering, ""Heller! How yer dern?""--I have heard weird accents similar to this, but I think Perry is just making Madea even funnier. He does this weird accent like no one else can. Who else could refer to ""Cora"" as ""Cor-erd""?In the end, Perry has given audiences yet another fine work. Another reviewer says Perry is not ""fancy"", is to-the-point and bares all. I agree, and it makes him a worthwhile director, especially in today's world. What Perry ought to do better, I think, is stabilize his films so he can do pure drama and in the other hand do pure Madea films.One thing I cannot stand at this point is how confusing the character is, appearing first in plays and eventually making it to film. 2002 alone saw the creation and unleashing of Madea...and THREE films based on those plays, which have confused me even further. Are they the plays, or the films?? I can't tell.As my wife says, Perry makes films that don't seem to know what they want to be--and I have to agree with that. Even so, this film is a classic example of Perry's intention with Madea as a comic character. It's never been done before, so let us wish Perry a great and prosperous future and wish for ourselves more Madea films.",4,Halleluyer!!,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,3796,"['Mable', 'Madea', 'Simmons', 'like', 'shoot', 'hip', 'character', 'so', 'scatter-shot', 'yet', 'intensely', 'brilliant', 'grandmother', 'aunt', 'mother', 'even', 'times', 'father', 'My', 'wife', 'other', 'hand', 'loudly', 'denounce', 'Madea', 'annoying', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fat', 'suit', 'drag', 'Funnily', 'enough', 'wife', 'greatly', 'Madea.Letting', 'pass', 'loved', 'Madea', 'film', 'dramatic', 'storyline', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'know', 'nice', 'black', 'guy', 'screwed', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'when', 'old', 'flame', 'returns', ""'m"", 'amazed', ""n't"", 'kind', 'diary', 'film', 'Perry', 'THE', 'DIARY', 'A', 'MAD', 'BLACK', 'WOMAN', 'inspired', 'documentary', 'DIARY', 'A', 'TIRED', 'BLACK', 'MAN', ""'ll"", 'only', 'mention', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'who', 'most', 'adorable', 'creature.Meanwhile', 'Madea', 'getting', 'life', 'can', 'somehow', 'vaguely', 'connected', 'dramatic', 'part', 'operatic', 'proportions', 'angers', 'wife', 'too', 'trading', 'insults', 'brother', 'Joe', 'also', 'played', 'Perry', 'fighting', 'Christian', 'daughter', 'Cora', 'drama', 'up', 'other', 'group', 'folks', 'old', 'flame', 'tossed', 'jail', 'assistant', 'DA', 'nasty', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'up', 'charges', 'jealousy.Madea', 'up', 'front', 'infamous', 'Judge', 'Mathis', 'who', 'five', 'years', 'jail', 'finally', 'face', 'face', ""'old"", 'flame', 'Candy', 'only', 'Madea', 'can', 'fights', 'idiotic', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'had', 'rolling', 'floor', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'suffering', 'damned', 'drama', 'good', 'drama', 'here', 'just', 'screentime', 'Madea.By', 'bye', 'plays', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'gelquel', 'Perry', 'delightful', 'MEET', 'THE', 'BROWNS', 'MADEA', 'GOES', 'TO', 'JAIL', 'car', 'chase', 'witnessed', 'MEET', 'THE', 'BROWNS', 'instance', 'few', 'others', 'Madea', 'half-mythical', 'legendary', 'trouble-making', 'witch', 'Greek', 'namesake', 'evil', 'witch', 'named', 'Medea', 'great', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'Madea', 'opposite', 'soapbox', 'attitude', 'Perry', 'films.Exactly', 'Madea', 'Good', 'Alter', 'Ego', 'Hypocritical', 'Preachy', 'Drama', 'mind', 'fights', 'knowing', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'not', 'afraid', 'pull', 'gun', 'when', 'necessary', 'respect', 'Madea', 'one-character', 'argument', '2nd', 'Amendment', 'love', 'that.Some', 'people', 'have', 'stated', 'confusion', 'Madea', ""'accent"", 'wonder', 'Carolina', 'Brogue', 'kind', 'often', 'Halleluyer', 'most', 'popular', 'uttering', 'Heller', 'How', 'yer', 'dern', 'have', 'heard', 'weird', 'accents', 'similar', 'think', 'Perry', 'just', 'making', 'Madea', 'even', 'funnier', 'weird', 'accent', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'refer', 'Cora', 'Cor-erd', 'end', 'Perry', 'given', 'audiences', 'yet', 'fine', 'work', 'reviewer', 'Perry', 'not', 'fancy', 'to-the-point', 'agree', 'worthwhile', 'director', 'especially', 'today', 'world', 'What', 'Perry', 'ought', 'do', 'better', 'think', 'stabilize', 'films', 'can', 'do', 'pure', 'drama', 'other', 'hand', 'do', 'pure', 'Madea', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'point', 'how', 'confusing', 'character', 'appearing', 'first', 'plays', 'eventually', 'making', 'film', '2002', 'alone', 'saw', 'creation', 'unleashing', 'Madea', 'THREE', 'films', 'based', 'plays', 'have', 'confused', 'even', 'further', 'Are', 'plays', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell.As', 'wife', 'Perry', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'have', 'agree', 'Even', 'so', 'film', 'classic', 'example', 'Perry', 'intention', 'Madea', 'comic', 'character', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'let', 'wish', 'Perry', 'great', 'prosperous', 'future', 'wish', 'more', 'Madea', 'films']",Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail

1244822,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001WAKOX0,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[6, 6]","MADEA GOES TO JAILI am a Tyler Perry fan and was completely excited when I found out that this film was going to be his next, based on the great play I knew it would be a great film. So it came to theaters and like I thought it was a hit so I knew the DVD would be excellent. Finally when it came out it was bought for my girl for her birthday and we all had a great time watching it. Perry is excellent at delivering heartfelt films with a bit of comedy thrown into the mix. Like before he succeeds here once again and delivers another marvelous film. Perry once again provides a well crafted drama/comedy that will have you hooked for sure.There are two different stories going on in this film like most Perry films, this like the others blends both stories very well and even brings them together. One follows Madea and her legal battles as she escapes prisons grasp only to fall prey to it later. This is the comedic side of the film as you know and really makes this movie funny. Then we have Joshua Hardaway an Assistant District Attorney who just landed a case that puts him back in touch with a former childhood friend who he elects to help. Since he didn't help at one time when she really needed it in their college days he feels the need now.  Of course this does not sit well with his fianc&eacute; who has a bit of a secret her self. Of course this is the more dramatic side of things and it is classic Tyler Perry, excellent story with these ones.Perry has always been an excellent writer and this shows exactly why he keeps churning out hit after hit. The script is full of great believable characters and full of emotion which only brings you into it. Of course his direction is great and keeps the movie moving along at a nice pace. Perry himself is great in three different roles and yes they are the same three he plays in all the Madea movies. Of course the lead character Madea is excellent and one of the most fun characters in film history and Perry as usual is brilliant in the role. Then there is Madea's brother Joe is funny as always especially during the party scene. And then there is Perry with out a get playing Brian who is the family's lawyer, and a member himself.Derek Luke is great as Joshua and brings a real feel of emotion to the character and is very believable in the role. Keshia Knight Pulliam is absolutely brilliant as lost cause Candace who feels betrayed by Joshua over an incident [a really bad one] in college that led her to a life on the streets and prostitution. She may very well steal the show as far as the dramatic performances. Ion Overman is great as Joshua's girl who does not understand his feelings about his former childhood friend. David and Tamela Mann as always are great as the Browns and bring a lot to the comedic side of this film. Every one in this film did a great job and really bring it on this film. But if there is any one who is also up for show stealer it is Sof&iacute;a Vergara as T.T. who Perry fans may recognize from the ""Meet The Browns"" film. Her character is the craziest/funniest serial killer of all time, I loved it.This is one of the better releases thus far and is very much worth your money, this is a great movie.

1244844,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B001WAKOX0,LadyLestat,"[1, 1]","First of all, I absolutely love Tyler Perry movies just like I love all the stage plays. With that said, Madea goes to jail was a good movie, but it wasn't anything compared to ""The Family That Preys"", ""Madea's Family Reunion"", or ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"". I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to see Keshia Knight Pulliam out of her element. This was the first time that I could actually see past the fact that she was a ""Cosby kid"" and actually see her as a legitimate actress. Derek Luke was very good in his role as always. Madea was really funny and over the top as well, but I can't seem to get pass the fact that it seems like we've seen this all before. To it's credit, it does tell a deeper story than Madea going to jail for stealing gas like the stage play. Plus, it has a group of fresh actors in the cast like RonReaco Lee from ""Sister Sister"".

Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[1, 2]","I know there are those who won't agree, but I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I have some of the other Perry movies. First, ""Madea goes to Jail"" was typical Tyler Perry, there was nothing new or exciting. The cookie cutter formula of ""man does woman wrong, woman struggles, Madea acts a fool but has a good heart, and everything works out after a great deal of struggle, with a lot of laughs and some serious moments"" is still the recipe of this Perry movie. However, there were also some lose ends that seemed to hang out there left unanswered.Madea is once again facing jail time for actions that she takes when a woman steals her parking space. Willing to do things that the average person is afraid to do, she takes things into her own hands and issues her own brand of justice. Facing a less lenient Judge (Judge Mathis), Madea is sentenced to some prison time. Meanwhile, an over zealous prosecutor, fueled by jealousy, insures a stiff sentence for her fianc&eacute;e's friend, Candace (played by Cosby show's Keshia Knight Pulliam) by committing prosecutorial misconduct. Surrounded by several interesting characters, both Madea and Candace (rape victim turned prostitute) do what they have to do in order to survive prison.Although there were some funny situations and lines in this latest Perry production (the Uncle is still a hoot), I don't think it offered anything new or original. Perry's formula of victimization, laughs and someone done someone wrong worked to a point, but would have been better if some of the storylines had been followed through.  I thought Madea would pass along some of her wisdom or influence Candace more than she did. Instead, Candace and Madea seem to just be in the same institution with no real interaction. In other Perry movies,  Madea was instrumental in helping the main character recognize her victimization as well as provide support for her to do something about it. In this movie, Madea was just in the prison and providing some comic relief but in my opinion not really influencing Candace. Then again, maybe I have come to expect a lot in Perry movies and was just disappointed. Was it the worse movie to watch on a Sunday evening, no...would I have paid to see it in the theater, no.",2,Some are not going to agree.....,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2241,"['know', 'are', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'agree', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'other', 'Perry', 'movies', 'First', 'Madea', 'Jail', 'was', 'typical', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'exciting', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'formula', 'man', 'woman', 'wrong', 'woman', 'struggles', 'Madea', 'fool', 'good', 'heart', 'everything', 'works', 'out', 'great', 'deal', 'struggle', 'lot', 'laughs', 'serious', 'moments', 'still', 'recipe', 'Perry', 'movie', 'However', 'were', 'also', 'lose', 'ends', 'seemed', 'hang', 'out', 'there', 'left', 'unanswered.Madea', 'once', 'again', 'facing', 'jail', 'time', 'actions', 'when', 'woman', 'parking', 'space', 'Willing', 'do', 'things', 'average', 'person', 'afraid', 'do', 'things', 'own', 'hands', 'issues', 'own', 'brand', 'justice', 'Facing', 'less', 'lenient', 'Judge', 'Judge', 'Mathis', 'Madea', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'zealous', 'prosecutor', 'fueled', 'jealousy', 'stiff', 'sentence', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'friend', 'Candace', 'played', 'Cosby', 'show', 'Keshia', 'Knight', 'Pulliam', 'committing', 'prosecutorial', 'misconduct', 'Surrounded', 'several', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Madea', 'Candace', 'rape', 'victim', 'turned', 'prostitute', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'order', 'survive', 'were', 'funny', 'situations', 'lines', 'latest', 'Perry', 'production', 'Uncle', 'still', 'hoot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'offered', 'anything', 'new', 'original', 'Perry', 'formula', 'victimization', 'someone', 'done', 'someone', 'wrong', 'worked', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'storylines', 'had', 'been', 'followed', 'thought', 'Madea', 'would', 'pass', 'wisdom', 'influence', 'Candace', 'more', 'did', 'Instead', 'Candace', 'Madea', 'seem', 'just', 'be', 'same', 'institution', 'real', 'interaction', 'other', 'Perry', 'movies', 'Madea', 'was', 'instrumental', 'helping', 'main', 'character', 'recognize', 'victimization', 'as', 'well', 'provide', 'support', 'do', 'something', 'movie', 'Madea', 'was', 'just', 'prison', 'providing', 'comic', 'relief', 'opinion', 'not', 'really', 'influencing', 'Candace', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'lot', 'Perry', 'movies', 'was', 'just', 'disappointed', 'Was', 'worse', 'movie', 'watch', 'Sunday', 'evening', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'see', 'theater']",Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail

1244874,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001WAKOX0,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","Tyler Perry's storytelling skills are about as rudimentary as they come.  His modus operandi is generally to gather together a group of two-dimensional characters and broad comic stereotypes to act out a simplistic morality tale - then throw in some  lowbrow buffoonery and high-minded sanctimony for good measure.  In Perry's world, good and evil are real, palpable entities and just about everyone we meet is either a hero or a villain.  ""Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail"" is no exception to that rule.And don't let the title mislead you, for the sassy, take-no-prisoners Madea (played by Tyler Perry in drag) is little more than a glorified second banana in a movie that is all over the map when it comes to plotline, character development and tone.  In fact, thanks to its gear-grinding tonal shifts, the film feels more like a series of comic sketches interrupted periodically by bits of social drama - or maybe it's the other way around - than like a fully developed and integrated work in its own right (the scenes in prison are particularly egregious).The ""comic"" storyline centers around Madea's apprehension for speeding and resisting arrest (a scene that actually took place in Perry's earlier film, ""Meet the Browns""), though the jail time she faces is actually for a subsequent offense.  The ""serious"" plot thread involves Derek Luke and Ion Overman as two impossibly attractive attorneys who are engaged to be married and who keep bickering over just how concerned Joshua (Luke) should be about the people he's left behind in the ""ghetto.""  Joshua wants to lend a helping hand to a female pal from college who's become a drug addict and a hooker (Keshia Knight Pulliam, an all-grown-up Rudy from ""The Cosby Show""), while the unscrupulous Linda - a spoiled little ""princess"" who's always had daddy's money to make things easy for her - thinks Joshua should just do his job and let the young woman die on the streets or rot in prison for the rest of her life.  Needless to say, neither plot strand offers much in the way of plausibility or credibility, and the movie isn`t always even true to its own moral code.  For example, just after the imprisoned Madea has delivered an impassioned speech about how people ought to take responsibility for their actions and accept the consequences for their wrongdoing, she dances out of prison on a technicality.The actors do what they can with scene after preposterous scene, but you'd have to be a thespian on the order of a Laurence Olivier to triumph over a script as hopelessly messed-up as this one is.",2,ham-handed comic melodrama,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,2560,"['Tyler', 'Perry', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'are', 'as', 'rudimentary', 'come', 'modus', 'operandi', 'generally', 'gather', 'together', 'group', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'broad', 'comic', 'stereotypes', 'act', 'out', 'simplistic', 'morality', 'tale', 'then', 'throw', 'lowbrow', 'buffoonery', 'high-minded', 'sanctimony', 'good', 'measure', 'Perry', 'world', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'real', 'palpable', 'entities', 'just', 'everyone', 'meet', 'hero', 'villain', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Madea', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'exception', 'rule.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'title', 'mislead', 'sassy', 'take-no-prisoners', 'Madea', 'played', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'drag', 'little', 'more', 'glorified', 'second', 'banana', 'movie', 'map', 'when', 'plotline', 'character', 'development', 'tone', 'fact', 'thanks', 'gear-grinding', 'tonal', 'shifts', 'film', 'more', 'series', 'comic', 'sketches', 'interrupted', 'periodically', 'bits', 'social', 'drama', 'maybe', 'other', 'way', 'fully', 'developed', 'integrated', 'work', 'own', 'right', 'scenes', 'prison', 'are', 'particularly', 'egregious', '.The', 'comic', 'storyline', 'centers', 'Madea', 'apprehension', 'speeding', 'resisting', 'arrest', 'scene', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'Perry', 'earlier', 'film', 'Meet', 'Browns', 'jail', 'time', 'actually', 'subsequent', 'offense', 'serious', 'plot', 'thread', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Ion', 'Overman', 'two', 'impossibly', 'attractive', 'attorneys', 'who', 'are', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'who', 'keep', 'bickering', 'over', 'just', 'how', 'concerned', 'Joshua', 'Luke', 'should', 'be', 'people', 'left', 'ghetto', 'Joshua', 'lend', 'helping', 'hand', 'female', 'pal', 'college', 'who', 'become', 'drug', 'addict', 'hooker', 'Keshia', 'Knight', 'Pulliam', 'all-grown-up', 'Rudy', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'unscrupulous', 'Linda', 'spoiled', 'little', 'princess', 'who', 'always', 'had', 'daddy', 'money', 'make', 'things', 'easy', 'thinks', 'Joshua', 'should', 'just', 'do', 'job', 'let', 'young', 'woman', 'die', 'streets', 'rot', 'prison', 'rest', 'life', 'Needless', 'say', 'plot', 'strand', 'offers', 'much', 'way', 'plausibility', 'credibility', 'movie', 'isn', 't', 'always', 'even', 'true', 'own', 'moral', 'code', 'example', 'just', 'imprisoned', 'Madea', 'delivered', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'how', 'people', 'ought', 'take', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'accept', 'consequences', 'wrongdoing', 'prison', 'technicality.The', 'actors', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'scene', 'preposterous', 'scene', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'thespian', 'order', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'triumph', 'over', 'script', 'hopelessly', 'messed-up', 'one']",Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[3, 4]","Cons: As with all Tyler Perry movies and plays, there's someone addicted to drugs, a prostitute, a victim of child molestation, Madea with a gun, and a man to save the day. If you've seen one Tyler Perry movie or play, you've pretty much seen them all. ""Daddy's Little Girls"" was the most unique one that I've seen so far and my favorite of them all, minus the play version of ""Madea Goes to Jail.""Sometimes Tyler Perry creates scenes that just wouldn't happen. If the movie was a full comedy, I could let it slide. But you can't have a comedic drama and then parts that would just never happen. I have yet to call information or the operator and get a cell phone number. The call should have gone to the lawyer's home phone instead of a vibrating cell phone. I don't believe cell phones can even take collect calls.Pros: Tyler Perry knows how to pick good guy characters. With the play, women got to admire eye candy like Ryan Gentles and Christian Keyes. In this movie, we got to grin at Derek Luke, especially the scene when he cuddles up behind Keyshia Knight Pulliam's character on the couch. Very cute! There were definitely some hilarious scenes (ex. Big Poppa, Madea and the news after the television was turned off, Joe and his weed). Tyler Perry can bring the funny.Would I want to see this movie in the theater? No. Did I? For the very first time, no. The only reason I did not see it in a movie theater was because I kept thinking, ""Do I want to pay $8.50 to see the same plot in his last movie?"" I really hope that Perry starts to branch out. ""The Family that Preys"" shows me he can. ""Daddy's Little Girls"" went against the stereotypes of deadbeat dads. I'd like to see him branch out like this more often, but of course I always love to see Madea so keep her too! Do I still support his films and plays? Yes, but so far, all of the plays have been better than the movies.
