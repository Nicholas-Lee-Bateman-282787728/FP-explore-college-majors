1082879,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B000RO6JZE,A Forest Fan,"[3, 3]","This season of Boston Legal really hits the stride. Or is that fair for a series that hit its stride with the pilot episode, and kept on going? Great fun with all the cast and predicaments they get themselves into. Actually, no one really seems to care of the trouble they get in. Life just kind of slides off their shoulders as they smile for the cameras and put up with the difficulties knowing they will win the day.Occasionally the series has unintentional humor, such as when they have Alan Shore (James Spader) or Candice Bergen (Shirley Schmidt) lecture the audience on Guantanamo Bay, domestic wiretapping, and enemy combatants not permitted trials in civilian court. Surprise, liberals! President Obama continued every Bush policy he campaigned against, it was just to get the votes of the uninformed (which he did and they are). Watching Alan Shore rail against the injustice of a Bush world is very humorous when watched in 2011, and we see every hyper-partisan complaint continues onwards with Obama running things. As Hands would say, 'eep!'Get past that occasional politicking for the DNC (and there is a lot of it), and you have a fine show.",4,"Boston Legal entertains, flops at political laughs",1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,1156,"['season', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'really', 'stride', 'fair', 'series', 'hit', 'stride', 'pilot', 'episode', 'kept', 'going', 'Great', 'fun', 'cast', 'predicaments', 'get', 'Actually', 'one', 'really', 'care', 'trouble', 'get', 'Life', 'just', 'kind', 'slides', 'shoulders', 'smile', 'cameras', 'put', 'up', 'difficulties', 'knowing', 'will', 'win', 'day.Occasionally', 'series', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'such', 'when', 'have', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'James', 'Spader', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Shirley', 'Schmidt', 'lecture', 'audience', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'domestic', 'wiretapping', 'enemy', 'combatants', 'not', 'permitted', 'trials', 'civilian', 'court', 'Surprise', 'liberals', 'President', 'Obama', 'continued', 'Bush', 'policy', 'campaigned', 'was', 'just', 'get', 'votes', 'uninformed', 'did', 'are', 'Watching', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'rail', 'injustice', 'Bush', 'world', 'very', 'humorous', 'when', 'watched', '2011', 'see', 'hyper-partisan', 'complaint', 'onwards', 'Obama', 'running', 'things', 'Hands', 'would', 'say', ""'eep"", ""'Get"", 'occasional', 'politicking', 'DNC', 'lot', 'have', 'fine', 'show']",Boston Legal - Season Three
1082880,A22UCQ7WIYIJE3,B000RO6JZE,A. J. Cherrington,"[3, 4]","One of the most popular spin-off television series ever. This brillant production reached it's nadar in series three, the first nine episodes were just magnificant and then it seemed to ""jump the shark"" as they say.David E Kelly's writing is still great but I feel he is trying to place to much comedy into situations and this has IMO dumbed down Boston Legal from witty intellegence to just plain pointlessness.Main Characters are being subject to sillyness and as a BL fan I can say some boundries should never have been crossed, i.e. Allen's behaviour towards Denice.  Further more, the Allen and Denny banter is becoming tired, Shirley has become one-dimentional, while the likes of Paul, Brad and Geoffrey were made to become side characters as the predictable cleanout as season four approached. Naturally Denice slowed down as actor Julie Bowden entered motherhood.Newbees Clarance, Claire and now regular Jerry, pick up some airtime but Claire pretty much dissapears from view untill the end.David E Kelly's policy of revolving doors for his actors have and will see major changes...Season Four attests to this already.I would have really like to see Edwin Poole return for the Deep End Of The Poole ""Little Jimmys"" addiction case that showed so much promise with Shirley getting some action.  Also a visit from Donny Crane would have kept the continuation of the surrogate son relationship with Denny alive.A couple of small special features included (on disc 5 & six)but basic viewing is what a series box set is all about.Not as good as Season Two but still worth viewing. As season four is now viewing I feel this could be the last.",4,Too Many Changes...,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,1644,"['One', 'most', 'popular', 'spin-off', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'brillant', 'production', 'reached', 'nadar', 'series', 'three', 'first', 'nine', 'episodes', 'were', 'just', 'magnificant', 'then', 'seemed', 'jump', 'shark', 'say.David', 'E', 'Kelly', 'writing', 'still', 'great', 'feel', 'trying', 'place', 'much', 'comedy', 'situations', 'IMO', 'dumbed', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'witty', 'intellegence', 'just', 'plain', 'pointlessness.Main', 'Characters', 'are', 'being', 'subject', 'sillyness', 'BL', 'fan', 'can', 'say', 'boundries', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'crossed', 'i.e', 'Allen', 'behaviour', 'towards', 'Denice', 'Further', 'more', 'Allen', 'Denny', 'banter', 'becoming', 'tired', 'Shirley', 'become', 'one-dimentional', 'likes', 'Paul', 'Brad', 'Geoffrey', 'were', 'made', 'become', 'side', 'characters', 'predictable', 'cleanout', 'season', 'four', 'approached', 'Naturally', 'Denice', 'slowed', 'down', 'as', 'actor', 'Julie', 'Bowden', 'entered', 'motherhood.Newbees', 'Clarance', 'Claire', 'now', 'regular', 'Jerry', 'pick', 'up', 'airtime', 'Claire', 'pretty', 'much', 'dissapears', 'view', 'end.David', 'E', 'Kelly', 'policy', 'revolving', 'doors', 'actors', 'have', 'will', 'see', 'major', 'changes', 'Season', 'Four', 'already.I', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'Edwin', 'Poole', 'return', 'Deep', 'End', 'Poole', 'Little', 'Jimmys', 'addiction', 'case', 'showed', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'Shirley', 'getting', 'action', 'Also', 'visit', 'Donny', 'Crane', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'continuation', 'surrogate', 'son', 'relationship', 'Denny', 'alive.A', 'couple', 'small', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'disc', '5', 'six', 'basic', 'viewing', 'what', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'about.Not', 'as', 'good', 'Season', 'Two', 'still', 'worth', 'viewing', 'season', 'four', 'now', 'viewing', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'last']",Boston Legal - Season Three

1082883,A3DIS5O83SQJWW,B000RO6JZE,"Amazon Customer ""geekacres""","[0, 0]","I picked up Season Three of Boston Legal, because I am a big fan of many of the Star Trek actors who are regulars or guest stars on the program.  William Shatner is obviously at the forefront.  That said, the formidable team of Rene A and Armin S also appear on the scene minus all of the prosthetic ""alien parts"" they wore in DS9Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Complete Series (Seasons 1-7).  Speaking of aliens you may know, actor Ethan Phillips beams in from the Starship VoyagerStar Trek Voyager - The Complete Seventh Seasonto take his turn as the dad of a suspected judge killer.  The rest of the cast - including Murphy Brown'sMurphy Brown: The Complete First SeasonCandice Bergen, and the always-fun James Spader - provide tremendous variety and enthusiasm.All of this said, I expected the show to be a lot of fun, as I have enjoyed other David E Kelley productions such as Ally McBeal and The Practice.  And Boston Legal does not disappoint.  The writing reminds me a great deal of the legal drama and character-driven antics found in Ally.  Shatner's would-be romance with a petit attorney could go toe-to-toe with the escapades of McBeal's fetish-obsessed Richard Fish('bygones').The show is silly and serious and fans of other David E Kelley creations, are certain to devour it with much gusto.

1082890,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000RO6JZE,Galina,"[5, 5]","Boston Legal is my dream come true - Comedy / Crime /Legal Courtroom Drama which is a perfect combination of all genres and is as funny as it is clever and gripping. The idea of ""Boston Legal"" had came to its creator, David E. Kelley during the last season of once very popular but sadly quietly dying legal drama ""Practice"". I was a big fan of the show and I stayed with it to the end. Bringing to ""Young, Berluti, & Frutt"" of ""Practice"" an ethically-challenged, arrogant, morally ambiguous but brilliant and somehow likable attorney Alan Shore (James Spader) was Kelley's great idea. The last season of Practice became one of best thanks to Spader who resurrected it by simply being there. When I heard that Spader would have a spin-off ""Boston Legal"", I could hardly wait for it and it has never disappointed me. Boston Legal is ""Crane, Poole, and Schmidt"", a famous and wealthy firm that specializes on civil cases. In the center of the show are Alan Shore and his older friend and mentor Denny Crane (William Shattner). To bring them together in one show and let them have a wonderful relationship that is based on their differences (comparing to Denny who is in love with the sound of his own name, Alan seems highly moral and stable model citizen) and is at the same time hilarious, sincere, and moving was a pure genius. Each episode would end with both Alan and Denny sitting on the balcony, smoking cigars, drinking scotch and having a friendly conversation and those are the best moments of the show.Alan and Denny are the central characters in ""Boston Legal"" but every attorney in the ""Crane, Poole, and Schmidt"" is a unique individual. There is a former marine Brad, the veteran of Operation Desert Storm with the strong principles - the complete opposite to Alan. There is Clarence, a man with several personalities and Claire, the girl who loves him. Candice Bergen has joined the cast at Crane, Poole, and Schmidt, as Shirley Schmidt, sharp like a razor senior partner as brilliant, manipulative, and arrogant as both Denny and Alan are. There is also a dwarf Bethany ""who comes and goes"" with whom Denny has an on- and off- relationship. Jerry ""Hands"" Espenson with his Asperger syndrome has re-joined the firm and his return will certainly add to the practice (and the show) success. You may like them or not but they all have one thing in common - they are fantastic attorneys, always on the top of their game. All actors, the series regulars and the guests constantly give first-class performances, Writing is superb in every episode and ""Boston Legal"" has become one of if not the best comedy-drama on TV today.In the conclusion, I'd like to share one of my favorite scenes in the show. Denny and Allan are on the balcony talking about Shirley. Denny and Shirley used to have a passionate affair way back and she is still the love of his life. Alan's lust for Shirley is so overwhelming that he showed up in the office party dressed up like her (and he managed to look better than she did) explaining that everyone had to dress up like a person he/she admires the most.Denny (thoughtfully, remembering something very special to him) -""Shirley...One night while making love, she recited Proust.""Alan: ""Did you understand it?""Denny: ""Not a single word. I thought she was possessed",5,"Denny Crane:"" We look good together"". Alan Shore: ""Yes, we do.""",1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,3299,"['Boston', 'Legal', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Comedy', '/', 'Crime', '/Legal', 'Courtroom', 'Drama', 'perfect', 'combination', 'genres', 'as', 'funny', 'clever', 'gripping', 'idea', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'had', 'came', 'creator', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelley', 'last', 'season', 'once', 'very', 'popular', 'sadly', 'quietly', 'dying', 'legal', 'drama', 'Practice', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'stayed', 'end', 'Bringing', 'Young', 'Berluti', 'Frutt', 'Practice', 'ethically-challenged', 'arrogant', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'brilliant', 'somehow', 'likable', 'attorney', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'James', 'Spader', 'was', 'Kelley', 'great', 'idea', 'last', 'season', 'Practice', 'became', 'one', 'best', 'thanks', 'Spader', 'who', 'resurrected', 'simply', 'being', 'there', 'When', 'heard', 'Spader', 'would', 'have', 'spin-off', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'never', 'disappointed', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'Crane', 'Poole', 'Schmidt', 'famous', 'wealthy', 'firm', 'civil', 'cases', 'center', 'show', 'are', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'older', 'friend', 'mentor', 'Denny', 'Crane', 'William', 'Shattner', 'bring', 'together', 'one', 'show', 'let', 'have', 'wonderful', 'relationship', 'based', 'differences', 'comparing', 'Denny', 'who', 'love', 'sound', 'own', 'name', 'Alan', 'highly', 'moral', 'stable', 'model', 'citizen', 'same', 'time', 'hilarious', 'sincere', 'moving', 'was', 'pure', 'genius', 'episode', 'would', 'end', 'Alan', 'Denny', 'sitting', 'balcony', 'smoking', 'cigars', 'drinking', 'scotch', 'having', 'friendly', 'conversation', 'are', 'best', 'moments', 'show.Alan', 'Denny', 'are', 'central', 'characters', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'attorney', 'Crane', 'Poole', 'Schmidt', 'unique', 'individual', 'former', 'marine', 'Brad', 'veteran', 'Operation', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'strong', 'principles', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Alan', 'Clarence', 'man', 'several', 'personalities', 'Claire', 'girl', 'who', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'joined', 'cast', 'Crane', 'Poole', 'Schmidt', 'Shirley', 'Schmidt', 'sharp', 'razor', 'senior', 'partner', 'brilliant', 'manipulative', 'arrogant', 'Denny', 'Alan', 'are', 'also', 'dwarf', 'Bethany', 'who', 'whom', 'Denny', 'on-', 'off-', 'relationship', 'Jerry', 'Hands', 'Espenson', 'Asperger', 'syndrome', 're-joined', 'firm', 'return', 'will', 'certainly', 'add', 'practice', 'show', 'success', 'may', 'like', 'not', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'are', 'fantastic', 'attorneys', 'always', 'top', 'game', 'actors', 'series', 'regulars', 'guests', 'constantly', 'give', 'first-class', 'performances', 'Writing', 'superb', 'episode', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'become', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'comedy-drama', 'TV', 'conclusion', ""'d"", 'like', 'share', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'show', 'Denny', 'Allan', 'are', 'balcony', 'talking', 'Shirley', 'Denny', 'Shirley', 'used', 'have', 'passionate', 'affair', 'way', 'back', 'still', 'love', 'life', 'Alan', 'lust', 'Shirley', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'showed', 'up', 'office', 'party', 'dressed', 'up', 'managed', 'look', 'better', 'did', 'explaining', 'everyone', 'had', 'dress', 'up', 'person', 'he/she', 'most.Denny', 'thoughtfully', 'remembering', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'Shirley', 'One', 'night', 'making', 'love', 'recited', 'Proust', 'Alan', 'Did', 'understand', 'Denny', 'Not', 'single', 'word', 'thought', 'was', 'possessed']",Boston Legal - Season Three

Each episode is an exciting collection of deliciously absurd adventures and eloquent closing speeches that would have made Daniel Webster proud. The outrageous situations that the staff of Crane Schmidt & Poole get into sometimes make you wonder how they have any time to do their work. You sometimes get the impression that, in the quest for a few laughs, some stories get a bit over the top by being outrageous simply for its own sake. You have to wonder whether, as Denny Crane, you're seeing the real William Shatner or just a character he's playing, and his outrageous egomania can be quite amusing, but after a while you start to wonder what it would be like if he actually did, just once, have a tiny speck of humility!

I never watch shows on tv but in fact originally ordered the DVD for John who is a Law and Order die-hard.  Certainly, if you enjoy legal shows or are an attorney, you will like Boston Legal - but those of you who aren't particularly drawn to such shows will also love this show.Boston Legal showcases typically 2 cases, as well as some inter-office drama, but the heart of this series is more about the friendship between William Shatner and James Spader.  I never knew what great actors these two men were!  James Spader had always been a ""pretty boy"" so that you couldn't really see past his looks, but he won an Emmy for this show. Likewise, Shatner absolutely SHINES in this drama.One of the unique shows of Season 3 is Episode 18 where there are ""flashbacks"" of Shatner as a young man.  To show this, they use a movie that he starred in with Ralph Bellamy almost 50 years ago. It was astounding!I am not a person who gets amused by many shows.

1082906,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000RO6JZE,Little Miss Cutey,"[9, 9]","Boston Legal is one of my favourite television shows (after CSI).  It has brilliant, clever and funny writing and I really enjoy it.  Each season seems to get better and better and the 3rd season is no exception.  Here are the way the episodes go.1.  Can't We All Get A Lung?Alan hires a sexual surrogate to help Jerry Espenson overcome his fear of intimacy with women, which only gets Jerry in more legal trouble. And Shirley takes Daniel Post's case after Denise learns that her fianc&eacute; is planning to buy a lung from a terminally-ill man.2.  New Kids On The Block.A cocky new lawyer joins the firm from the New York office and defends a client who was having an adulterous affair with a murdered judge, and Denny gets in more hot water after a blind date with a ""midget.""3.  Desperately Seeking Shirley.Alan represents Shirley's ex-husband, who is looking for a hole in his new post-nup, which was written by Shirley. Meanwhile, the judge's murder trial continues, and Denny reaches a compromise after the little person sues him.4.  Fine Young Cannibal.Alan and Shirley take on a grandstanding District Attorney prosecuting a homeless man for cannibalism. The case gives Alan an opportunity to make his move on her, but he can't get together with her without Denny's approval.5.  Whose God Is It Anyway?Jeffery, Claire and Denise's judge murder trial gets underway, and Alan defends Jerry Espenson after firing a lawyer in his new firm because he's a Scientologist.6.  The Verdict.Coho's defense weakens after his client's father testifies against him and Alan feels something is missing when he picks up his relationship with Sally.7.  Trick Or Treat.Alan must defend Jerry Espenson again, this time for committing perjury to get on a jury. Meanwhile, Denise learns that her fianc&eacute;, Daniel Post, has died, but the doctors are having trouble locating his remains.8.  Lincoln - Part 1.Lincoln Meyer chooses Denny to represent him when he's suspected of killing the judge. Jerry enlists Alan's help in a first degree murder case. Brad has had it with Jeffrey, who wants to have Shirley, and Alan overhears Denise telling Shirley about her desires and takes advantage of it. Denny, meanwhile, can't seem to decide between Bethany or her mother, so he wants them both, which neither one will give in to.9.  On The Ledge - Part 2.Lincoln goes to extremes and kidnaps Shirley. The trial begins for Jerry's client, who shines as an attorney in the court room, and Denny feels threatened by him, as Jerry and Alan begin to bond as friends. Brad and Jeffrey take their office relationship to the ""next level.""10. The Nutcrackers.Clarice applies for a job as Claire's new assistant, but she'll only hire him as Clarence. Alan's new case is involved in a friendly wager with Shirley. Brad and Jeffrey are assigned to work on a case, together, involving a woman who wants to sue God, even though they can't stand one another, which makes Denise feels more like a referee, than an attorney.11. Angel Of Death.Alan and Denny go to New Orleans to help defend a doctor on trial for euthanizing her patients during the flood after Hurricane Katrina, and Clarence sues a women's gym that revoked his membership after he revealed that he was a man.12. Nuts.The firm defends a grade school teacher who is sued after one of her students dies from a peanut allergy, and Alan takes on the Office of Homeland Security after Denny is wrongly placed on the ""no-fly list.""13. Dumping Bella.Denny takes Bella's case against an animal rights group opposed to her cosmetic testing procedures, and her daughter Bethany is opposing counsel. And at the same time, Denny wants to dump Bella because he's still in love with Bethany.14. Selling Sickness.Alan defends a judge suing a company promising to cure him of ""same sex attraction disorder,"" and Shirley defends a man keeping a teenage sexual assault victim from taking medication that will make her forget the experience.15. Fat Burner.Denny is sued for operating a company that wants to turn human fat into fuel, Clarence gets his first case, and Jeffery submits his resignation after he finds out that he's not the father of Denise's child.16. The Good Lawyer.Alan feels guilty after teaching Jerry Espenson a cruel lesson on being a good lawyer, Denny creates a scene at Bethany's temple, and Brad and Denise come to blows over whether she should give up her career to take care of their baby.17. The Bride Wore Blood.Alan defends his ex-girlfriend Renata when she is accused of murdering her groom-to-be. And when the case starts going badly, she drops a personal bombshell in her defense that not even Alan knows about.18. Son Of The Defender.Denny is forced to recount a trial with his father from fifty years earlier when the victim's son--carrying a gun and wired to a bomb--returns demanding justice. Meanwhile, Alan is found in contempt of court again while defending his neighbor.19. Brotherly Love.When Paul tries to force Brad to sign an agreement in order to keep the firm out of getting in between him and Denise, Brad forces the rest of the partners to reconsider their position. When Claire sees Clarence in a coffee shop with another woman, she reconsiders their position. Alan defends a man accused of helping his brother cover up a murder.20. Guise N Dolls.Alan goes head to head with Jerry, but Alan doesn't like the arrogant, boorish persona Jerry has assumed for the case. And Denny gets the firm in hot water when he ""compliments"" an African-American job applicant.21. Tea And Sympathy.Judge Weldon asks Alan to defend her in a case, which leads to a potential relationship. Meanwhile, Clarence has a client who wants to sue a college sorority for kicking her out, and Jerry Espenson is opposing counsel.22. Guantanamo By The Bay.Jerry shows up at Shirley's office, wishing to return to the firm and clients include someone who was detained at the hands of the government, who felt he was involved in a terrorist plot of some kind. Gloria warns Alan that Judge Folger entertains more lawyers in her chambers than motions in her courtroom.23. Duck And Cover.Alan defends a priest on trial for housing an illegal alien, and Brad and Denise hurry to get married before their baby is born. Meanwhile, Shirley gives Jerry a housing discrimination case involving a woman and her duck.24. Trial Of The Century.Alan and Denny resort to a dangerous strategy to create reasonable doubt and get two teenage brothers acquitted of murdering their father. And Shirley gets angry with Jerry and Clarence when they sue a casino.Each episode is fantastic and while there are some silly senarios in some parts (Jerry Espenson's condition that makes him make animal noises and strange other problems), they do tackle interesting issues in their various trials and cases.

1082915,A1Y8238JIQN0Y7,B000RO6JZE,nmollo,"[1, 2]","BOSTON LEGAL: SEASON 4 - 2007The loss of Brad is a serious blunder but the three protagonists William Shatner, James Spader and Candice Bergen can still hold it together. After recovering from the weak word salad gag from the first season, Alan Shore gives a speech to Denny on the balcony about losing his virginity. It is a masterful piece of acting. Shatners reactions are priceless.The magic that these two have is a wonder to behold.I don't mind Saffron Burrows. Not at all as good as Tara but still hot.There are lots of new characters this season. There has been a good cleanout. I love the introduction of the Brit, Tara Summers. She is a very good actor. Her delivery of `the `dog's bollocks' was spot on. The Fat Black transvestite is gone and I for one am glad. I felt his performance was unconvincing in either character. The introduction of John Larroquette is iffy because Cadice Bergun has better taste. Denny would be crushed at how low she has gone. Christian Clemenson is a very good actor. I do hope `Hands' doesn't turn into a lolly pop boy.The Season has started strongly for a change and ""Do Tell"" is a finely worked play but for that stupid word salad number. James Spader is too good an actor for those unconvincing gags.Brad Chase played by Mark Valley has left to be a district Attorney, which is a bit of a shock considering the pay cut. What a talent is missing from the threesome. I don't mind the black girl with the wig. Taraji P. Henson. (Is she related to the Muppets? ) It must be hard to enter into a great show with such presence. I think she pulled it off but is it a wig designed by a Henson?I still miss Tara but I have heard from inside sources that she is shooting people in Hollywood, so beware. Brad, I know I will miss. All hail the threesome.BOSTON LEGAL: SEASON 3The first four episodes of Boston Legal Season three are very weak and provide a shaky start to this Classic American television series. Thankfully the following episodes soar in quality and the series returns to its confident and often brilliant best. The standout episodes are ""Lincoln"" and ""On the Ledge"".The problems with series three are simple. Poor casting is solely responsible for the weaker points in the show. The casting of Craig Bierko and Gary Anthony Williams are serious own goals. Craig Bierko is a comedy actor of sorts and it shows. His scenes have a lack of authenticity about them, as if he knows he is being funny. This actor does not have enough charm or talent to pull off the part of an intelligent and wisecracking lawyer. His underwritten part is not sure whether to be another Alan Shore or Brad Chase when really we need neither. Luckily he is conspicuously absent from all the latter episodes.Gary Anthony Williams is also a poor piece of casting. The actor is completely unconvincing and overplays his part ridiculously. He never listens to the other actors and continues to mug or make stupid facial expressions, which are distracting especially when he is not the focus of the scene. I think the theatrical term is ""upstaging"". The love interest he has with the Constance Zimmer is completely unconvincing because there is no chemistry between the two actors.That said the confirmed magic between Shatner and Spader is ever present. It is simply a joy to watch these brilliant actors at work. Candice Bergen is as riveting as ever. She is a wonderful Actor. Mark Valley is constantly underused but when he is lucky enough appear in an episode and show us how good he can be as an actor it often proves to be a highlight of the series.Constance Zimmer is very good addition to the cast but her part is woefully underwritten. I would like to see her become an honorary man in the eyes of Danny and Shore.Christian Clemenson delivers a perfectly pitched performance. Julie Bowen as always is perfect. Anthony Heald and the superb Henry Gibson need to be mentioned for their hugely enjoyable performances. All the other cast members are excellent but I would like to see the return of Christopher Rich.I feel the loss of Parker Posey from the cast roster was a shame as she portrayed a very compelling character that could have caused greater conflict within the Law Firm. I still feel the show misses Tara significantly.As a whole Season 3 keeps getting better and better because the writers realise that concentrating on the main relationships of the series makes for better episodes.BOSTON SEASON: One & Two""Boston Legal"" is that rare American show that is both intelligent and original. The result is a completely compelling and engrossing ""tele-visual feast"".The almost magical chemistry between Shatner and Spader is remarkable to behold. This is a casting coup if there ever was one. Their relationship is beautifully played and completely life affirming. It is so good to see William Shatner being given the chance to perform in a part that demands of his talent. He has always been an extraordinary showman and it is a crime that it has taken so long to acknowledge just how good he is.Spader has a charm and perverseness as an actor that is hard to quantify. He has such allure and grace. His delivery of such very complicated and complex speeches is a master class for all in his profession. His performance, as is Shatner's, is simply brilliant!The actors are of course served with perceptive and enlightened scripts, that cry out for change in modern America. The scripts are never preachy and yet always funny. These scripts are excellent examples of great American screen writing, which more often that not is becoming harder to find.The casting is generally excellent. The loss of Rhona Mitra in the second series is a terrible blow. She is a very good actor and sorely missed. Mark Valley is also a hidden gem. Some of the best episodes involve his ""Mannix"" aspirations and his bouts of rapid verbal dexterity. The inclusion of Cadice Bergen to the heady mix of Shatner and Spader is a masterstroke. She is such a superb actor with an extraordinary depth. Her ability to deliver speeches with such brilliant clarity and simple emotion is a wonder to behold. Julie Bowen is another great addition to the second series. She is simply excellent. Her range of facial expressions seems limitless! Another casting coup is the inclusion of the talented Parker Posey towards the end of the second series. This is simply an inspired piece of casting. I hope her character will be developed further, as Parker Posey is an actor with a rare talent that includes precise comic timing. Anthony Heald and the superb Henry Gibson need to be mentioned for their perfectly pitched and hugely enjoyable performances. One actor in particular almost steals the show from Spader in the episode called ""Legal Deficits"". His name is Christopher Rich and he plays to perfection a creepy, ingratiating Texas Attorney. The scene between Rich and Spader is one of the most electrifying and satisfying in the whole series.The only criticism I have of ""Boston Legal"" is the development of the only completely unbelievable character in the series. Catherine Piper played unsympathetically by Betty White. Her performance is completely at odds with the rest of the show and cast. Her performance tries to be funny but is far from it. At one point she tells Alan Shore before his closing ""I hope you're good!"" The line falls completely flat. She then comments after his closing ""I thought you would be better!"" Again the line rings hollow as if it is played knowingly for laughs. This kind of unsubtle acting is simply out of style with the rest of the cast. I keep hoping her character will be written out, as she is the only negative in an almost perfect show, but no! She now quite unconvincingly evicts a young associate from his office and is pushing a tea trolley around!That said ""Boston Legal"" is an addictive show. One episode is never quite enough! Everyone involved in the show should feel blessed to be working on something truly special and original. This series will soon be regarded as the classic it most certainly is.",5,The Magic Continues!,1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,8057,"['BOSTON', 'LEGAL', 'SEASON', '4', '2007The', 'loss', 'Brad',

However, there are many episodes that have a punch in your face quality that goes beyond the poignant. When you combine it with humor you get a refreshing show. It seems to be a version of MASH, with the legal system itself on trial. Honestly, the relationship between Denny Crane & Alan Shore & the latters court closing arguments segments alone are worth four stars. These two men are similar to Hawkeye & Trapper John of MASH in respect to their individualism & disdain for authority.Episodes 2,4,7,11,16,18, & 23 appear to illustrate the ""food for thought,"" category best. They are titled respectively, ""New Kids On The Block, Fine Young Cannibal, Trick Or Treat, Angel Of Death, The Good Lawyer, Son Of The Defender, & Duck And Cover.""

This season is probably the best thus far because it touches upon the story of Jerry 'Hands' Espinson (Played by the brilliant Christian Clemson) There are great additions to the cast such has the witty Jeffrey Coho (Creig Bierko) The ice queen Claire Sims (Constance Zimmer) and the tough cookie that never sells herself short Bethany Horowitz (Meredith Eaton, who created the great ""don't look down' running gag) The cases still run from the serious to abstract with more of an emphasis on the characteristics of the judges and how some will intimidate and some times stimulate everyone all the way to Alan Shore. There are great stories that take place within the office itself including the strange 'hands off' policy Denny Crane places on Shirley Schmidt. This season is a real treat to be seen making the show bigger and better with every episode and great special apperiences, by Katey Segal, Bernidette Peters, Armin Shimmerman (Another Star Trek cast member) Just to name a few. More importantly more running gags making fun of their very own show on camera, anyone that can laugh at themselves is always comedy gold. Enjoy season three or Boston Legal and like the great William Shattner and James Spader say at end of the season...""To Next Season"" Cheers!",5,To Next Season!
