1361908,A37S4Y1K41C91M,B003T9YANM,Citizen Joe,"[39, 40]","I purchased this box set after reading the horrible reviews on the other box set being sold.I was very cautious about my expectations. Gozilla is an independent company and the claim of ""digital remastered"" did have me doubting.  When the package arrived I was in for a good surprise. The packaging is well done and the 8 discs are well secured in the single case. The image quality was a lot better than expected. It is true that it is not 1080HD but Gozilla made a very good effort in enhancing and improving the original prints on each episode.While some artifacts remain the image itself is very clean, sharper and the colors are bright and balanced.Occasionally the sound levels drop but not a big deal.  I recommend this to anyone since there are only a couple box sets available and I do not think the full collection will ever be officially released by any major studios.Note: On each episode the Gozilla logo flashes in and out in the lower corner, not a major issue but wish it was left off of the actual episodes.  Maybe a company spot in between each episode would be better.This box set not only includes the entire series run but the movie Voyage Into Space. This set also includes bonus Ultraman and Spectreman episodes on disc 07.",3,Very Good Effort in Preserving A Classic,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,1246,"['purchased', 'box', 'set', 'reading', 'horrible', 'reviews', 'other', 'box', 'set', 'being', 'sold.I', 'was', 'very', 'cautious', 'expectations', 'Gozilla', 'independent', 'company', 'claim', 'digital', 'remastered', 'did', 'have', 'doubting', 'When', 'package', 'arrived', 'was', 'good', 'surprise', 'packaging', 'well', 'done', '8', 'discs', 'are', 'well', 'secured', 'single', 'case', 'image', 'quality', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'expected', 'true', 'not', '1080HD', 'Gozilla', 'made', 'very', 'good', 'effort', 'enhancing', 'improving', 'original', 'prints', 'episode.While', 'artifacts', 'remain', 'image', 'very', 'clean', 'sharper', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'balanced.Occasionally', 'sound', 'levels', 'drop', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'box', 'sets', 'available', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'full', 'collection', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'officially', 'released', 'major', 'studios.Note', 'episode', 'Gozilla', 'logo', 'flashes', 'lower', 'corner', 'not', 'major', 'issue', 'wish', 'was', 'left', 'actual', 'episodes', 'Maybe', 'company', 'spot', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'better.This', 'box', 'set', 'not', 'only', 'entire', 'series', 'run', 'movie', 'Voyage', 'Into', 'Space', 'set', 'also', 'bonus', 'Ultraman', 'Spectreman', 'disc', '07']",Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot Complete Platinum Collection 8 DVD + Movie

That being said, as this show is not available in any other way, you need to decide if you care about the drawbacks enough to skip buying the only release of Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot - To me, it was totally worth the purchase - It's all about the nostalgia of growing up in the 70's and having Johnny Sokko rotated with Ultra Man after school (and yep, we had 'Monster Week' as well - usually featuring Godzilla movies....).
