It is notable andabove the mainstream, from its pure-raw scenarios, having viewers""connect"" to the action, with suspense, tension and a euphoria thatis buildt from start to finish. At the same time, there's a surreal""hero"" and ""against all odds"" story.Here, a Joe Schmoe rises above the gangster element present in thesmall town, that is bullying the local impassive sheriff, played bySeymour Cassel. Cassel's character is outplayed time and again bythe gang leader, who doesn't negotiate, or take into considerationearlier agreements, according to which he would left the town folkalone in exchange for 'carte blanche' in operating an airfield thatdeals in substances.At the outset, Busey's character is released from a sentence from arun-in with that same gang, occurred from lack of willingness of thetown folk to testify against the gang.When Busey settles in once more, his inpulse to set things right interms of a multitude of gang abuses (rape, aggression, intimidation,kidnapping) results in the use of a double barreled shotgun andvigilantism.Yaphet Kotto is caught in the middle, between desiring hisretirement pension from the force, months away and his friendshipwith Busey and doing what's right from a job point of view andhuman, as well.Kimberlin Brown (spouse) and Denise Galik  (nurse) are low-key,which is appropriate, as to now overshador Busey.The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in DVD releases,with the wide-screen and audio above and beyond a crystal clearquality, reminiscent of Enzo G. Castellari's filming quality whichis always incredible.The surreal aspect is underlined with Busey's  4x4 vehicle, in thetradition of Kit from Knight Rider, that has mortar and grenadelaunchers, machine guns and bullet proofing built-in the pickup,with the commands all reachable from the driver's seat.Being a Vietnam vet, Busey pulls a few rabbits from out of his hat,such as trip wires,  decoys, remote detonated IED's, and skill inman-to-man combats, facing  William Smith.The lesson learned, is not necessarily that vigilantism isappropriate or that it works, but rather, that in a group, therewill always be the wild-card element, that perhaps it's only amatter of time before an equal and opposite reaction is generated inresponse to a gangster action, with town folk coming to a consensuson the need for change.Motocross fans will especially appreciate the stunts shown by thehorse of  25+ bikers.For those seeking a raw, outdoor, filmed mostly in the desert actionmovie (think Genghis Khan), this is a good one.",3,"A pure-raw action movie, in the desert, with motocross hordes",1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,2655,"['Eye', 'Tiger', '1986', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'main', 'drawing', 'card', 'coupled', 'action-film', 'content', 'genre', 'notable', 'mainstream', 'pure-raw', 'scenarios', 'having', 'viewers', 'connect', 'action', 'suspense', 'tension', 'euphoria', 'thatis', 'buildt', 'start', 'finish', 'same', 'time', 'surreal', 'hero', 'odds', 'story.Here', 'Joe', 'Schmoe', 'gangster', 'element', 'present', 'thesmall', 'town', 'bullying', 'local', 'impassive', 'sheriff', 'played', 'bySeymour', 'Cassel', 'Cassel', 'character', 'outplayed', 'time', 'again', 'bythe', 'gang', 'leader', 'who', ""n't"", 'negotiate', 'take', 'considerationearlier', 'agreements', 'according', 'would', 'left', 'town', 'folkalone', 'exchange', ""'carte"", 'blanche', 'operating', 'airfield', 'thatdeals', 'substances.At', 'outset', 'Busey', 'character', 'released', 'sentence', 'arun-in', 'same', 'gang', 'occurred', 'lack', 'willingness', 'thetown', 'folk', 'testify', 'gang.When', 'Busey', 'once', 'more', 'inpulse', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'interms', 'multitude', 'gang', 'abuses', 'rape', 'aggression', 'intimidation', 'kidnapping', 'results', 'use', 'double', 'barreled', 'shotgun', 'andvigilantism.Yaphet', 'Kotto', 'caught', 'middle', 'desiring', 'hisretirement', 'pension', 'force', 'months', 'away', 'friendshipwith', 'Busey', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'job', 'point', 'view', 'andhuman', 'well.Kimberlin', 'Brown', 'spouse', 'Denise', 'Galik', 'nurse', 'are', 'low-key', 'appropriate', 'now', 'overshador', 'Busey.The', 'cinematography', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'releases', 'wide-screen', 'audio', 'above', 'crystal', 'clearquality', 'reminiscent', 'Enzo', 'G.', 'Castellari', 'filming', 'quality', 'whichis', 'always', 'incredible.The', 'surreal', 'aspect', 'underlined', 'Busey', '4x4', 'vehicle', 'thetradition', 'Kit', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'mortar', 'grenadelaunchers', 'machine', 'guns', 'bullet', 'proofing', 'built-in', 'pickup', 'commands', 'reachable', 'driver', 'seat.Being', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'Busey', 'few', 'rabbits', 'hat', 'such', 'trip', 'wires', 'decoys', 'remote', 'detonated', 'IED', 'skill', 'inman-to-man', 'combats', 'facing', 'William', 'Smith.The', 'lesson', 'learned', 'not', 'necessarily', 'vigilantism', 'isappropriate', 'rather', 'group', 'therewill', 'always', 'be', 'wild-card', 'element', 'perhaps', 'only', 'amatter', 'time', 'equal', 'opposite', 'reaction', 'generated', 'inresponse', 'gangster', 'action', 'town', 'folk', 'coming', 'consensuson', 'need', 'change.Motocross', 'fans', 'will', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'stunts', 'shown', 'thehorse', '25+', 'bikers.For', 'seeking', 'raw', 'outdoor', 'filmed', 'mostly', 'desert', 'actionmovie', 'think', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'good', 'one']",N/A

Using demolition, several deadly traps, brutal determination, and a badass bullet proof-pickup that is fully armed, he blows them away for killing his wife.

296175,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6302101948,Sid the Elf,"[7, 7]","Usually when the Eye of the Tiger song comes on your mind naturally brings you to picture Rocky and Apollo Creed duking it out ever so fake in the middle of the ring. However from this very day all we will see is a giant toothed Gary Busey who has just earned himself a top spot in Sid's ultimate action heroes. Over the years we have been huge fans of Busey (Brian, Brian, look. I'm Gary Busey. I'm frequently aggressive in situations that don't call for it) and all his crazy antics from B movies or celebrity rehab clips, but had no idea the action fury that dwells deep within him. We found this masterpiece on the Impact on-demand channel (yes the very same that brought usNinja Vengeance [VHS]) so going into it the expectations were somewhat high. No matter how high the expectations Eye of the Tiger surpassed them with ease by actually being an awesome action flick. It even went beyond the realm of B by making itself enjoyed on more of an actual movie basis. Fantastic!Gary plays newly paroled Buck Matthews who was wrongly sent away by crooked hick sheriff Seymour Cassel. Buck is a well respected Vietnam Vet around his old town and is looking forward to reuniting with his wife and daughter. What he doesn't realize is there's now a drug pushing motorcycle gang, led by a guy that looks like he's part of a Judas Priest cover band, whose wreaking havoc around his old stomping grounds. Once buck takes the law into his own hands against the gang the war begins. Once the gang takes his wives life Buck enlists the help of cop buddy J.B. Deveraux and prison pal Sal Pachino (who just happens to do the most hilarious Tony Montana impression). From here on out Buck starts taking down the hundreds of gang members one at a time with furious passion. We've always said you don't f*** with Chuck but that may have to be swapped out with Gary Busey who proved he's one of the kings out there.Eye of the Tiger really had everything a great b action should have. Going into it we were figuring a hilarious B was on the way, but much likeDeath Ring [VHS] it proved to be so much more then that by being an edge of your seat, kick butt, action masterpiece. At this point in Busey's career you could easily give him the Fulton and say ""this guy's got it"" in the acting department. Much like his role in Point Break he nailed it with ease.

296176,AF6MWBGDVB39Y,6302101948,The Whatever Dude,"[4, 4]","I recently purchased this, well not purchased, but my dear mom was nice enough to buy this DVD at Ross today for the low price of just $4.00. At first, I actually had no freakin' idea that this was on DVD to begin with. I thought the only available copy was the OOP VHS from USA Home Video (Which is now Lions Gate). It had a cooler cover than the DVD, but before I get back to the movie, I would just like to make a little rant about how the big Hollywood studios (And the greedy sharks that own them) keep changing the cover art (Or force the art department to do so) for DVD releases. This one's a good example. The cover art for the original VHS of this movie made it look fun and imo, somehow dramatic, but this cover looks like it's been made over at MGM using Photoshop. It just doesn't make the movie look good to a buyer. It seems like these studios could really care less about nostalgia and just only care about making it appeal to today's youth. I guess you could also say that the cover for this made it look like a Transporter Rip-Off or a John Woo-type movie from 2001.Anyway, back to the movie. It's about a Vietnam Vet/Ex-Con (He had been convicted for a crime he didn't commit) named Buck Matthews (Played by Gary Busey in as I stated, quite possibly his best role.) who had just been granted parole and he goes back to his hometown to move on with his life and his family, his wife Christie (Played by Denise Galik) and Jennifer (Played by Judith Barsi from the awful ""Jaws 4: The Revenge"", may god rest her poor soul).  We then see Buck at the police station, where he meets the corrput sherrif (Played by Seymour Cassel) and meets up with J.B. (Played by Yaphet Kotto) Also, Buck encounters a biker gang (The leader Blade, being played by the always awesome William Smith from ""Maniac Cop"") attacking a nurse, and  saves her life and he becomes a town hero. However, it isn't long before the gang attacks Buck's house and kills Christie. Then, the movie starts to move into Death Wish territory.I do not feel like going further for the moment (I really don't want to spoil anything for anybody), but I will say the rest gets more exciting every minute. That's just my opinion though.As for the DVD itself, there really isn't much, although MGM did do a good job with the very beautiful widescreen quality. There is a trailer, but that's pretty much it for extras. There could have been like a director's commentary or even a commentary by either Busey or Kotto or all 3, but I really don't know.Feel free to comment.",5,"A Fun Movie!
