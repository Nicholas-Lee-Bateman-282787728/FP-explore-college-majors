684079,A3MOHNZBTDGRRJ,B00005UF80,"D. Phillips ""Film fanatic and librarian""","[53, 55]","This an interesting assortment of films that manages generally to be diverse, entertaining and generally thought provoking.The first film is the charming ""Crush"".  The film starts with a preteen girl looking at a picture of hunky, teenage star and then cuts to a slightly older young man looking at the same picture. The film goes on to follow the eventual friendship of the young man and girl (who of course develops a crush for him).  The actors in the film  all seem very natural and most of the fun is watching them interact with each other as well as how they're going to work out their differences.  A very satisfying and enjoyable effort about a potentially painful subject.The next film ""The Mountain King"" is also fun to watch but less satisfying dramatically.  It begins with a man reading alone on a beach and another man who comes asks for a light then strips and runs into the ocean inviting the other man to come on in.  The film follows these two men as they talk about their lives and eventually couple in a fairly graphic sequence.  The film has a strong narrative pull and is always interesting but the resolution is not very satsifying (still this film is as good as anything in Boys Life 3).""...Lost"" is just a shade away from being porn.  It is extremely brief (just a few minutes) and then ends with a smack and punch line.  There is a tone of seriousness at the end that seems to be meant to justify pushing the sex on the viewer but really the film is just about the act itself.  The worst film of the lot.The final film, ""The Confession"" maybe the best.  It deals with subjects that are typically not dealt with in these short film collections.  It is about an older gay couple--one of whom is dying of an unspecified disease (although we are told early on it is not aids) and wants to confess his sins to a priest for absolution. His need causes a rift in the thirty plus year relationship. This brief film manages to tackle mortality and gay suspicion of the church all within its brief running time and to do it with poignancy, humanity and humor.  There is a lot here and yet the film does not feel (as many ambitious shorts do) as if it is too stuffed with material for its running time. It manages to resolve itself gracefully and it ends this collection on a high note that leaves the viewer with much to ponder.An enjoyable generally worthwhile collection of films that will please any fan of the genre.  It's the best collection I've seen since the first Boys Life.",4,One of the Better Gay Shorts Collections,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,2499,"['interesting', 'assortment', 'films', 'generally', 'be', 'diverse', 'entertaining', 'generally', 'thought', 'provoking.The', 'first', 'film', 'charming', 'Crush', 'film', 'preteen', 'girl', 'looking', 'picture', 'hunky', 'teenage', 'star', 'then', 'cuts', 'slightly', 'older', 'young', 'man', 'looking', 'same', 'picture', 'film', 'follow', 'eventual', 'friendship', 'young', 'man', 'girl', 'who', 'course', 'crush', 'actors', 'film', 'seem', 'very', 'natural', 'most', 'fun', 'watching', 'interact', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'work', 'out', 'differences', 'very', 'satisfying', 'enjoyable', 'effort', 'potentially', 'painful', 'subject.The', 'next', 'film', 'Mountain', 'King', 'also', 'fun', 'watch', 'less', 'satisfying', 'dramatically', 'man', 'reading', 'alone', 'beach', 'man', 'who', 'asks', 'light', 'then', 'strips', 'ocean', 'inviting', 'other', 'man', 'come', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'talk', 'lives', 'eventually', 'couple', 'fairly', 'graphic', 'sequence', 'film', 'strong', 'narrative', 'pull', 'always', 'interesting', 'resolution', 'not', 'very', 'satsifying', 'still', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'Boys', 'Life', '3', 'Lost', 'just', 'shade', 'away', 'being', 'porn', 'extremely', 'brief', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'then', 'smack', 'punch', 'line', 'tone', 'seriousness', 'end', 'be', 'meant', 'justify', 'pushing', 'sex', 'viewer', 'really', 'film', 'just', 'act', 'worst', 'film', 'lot.The', 'final', 'film', 'Confession', 'maybe', 'best', 'subjects', 'are', 'typically', 'not', 'dealt', 'short', 'film', 'collections', 'older', 'gay', 'couple', 'one', 'whom', 'dying', 'unspecified', 'disease', 'are', 'told', 'early', 'not', 'aids', 'confess', 'sins', 'priest', 'absolution', 'need', 'rift', 'thirty', 'year', 'relationship', 'brief', 'film', 'manages', 'tackle', 'mortality', 'gay', 'suspicion', 'church', 'brief', 'running', 'time', 'do', 'poignancy', 'humanity', 'humor', 'lot', 'here', 'yet', 'film', 'not', 'feel', 'many', 'ambitious', 'shorts', 'do', 'too', 'stuffed', 'material', 'running', 'time', 'resolve', 'gracefully', 'collection', 'high', 'note', 'viewer', 'much', 'ponder.An', 'enjoyable', 'generally', 'worthwhile', 'collection', 'films', 'will', 'please', 'fan', 'genre', 'best', 'collection', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'Boys', 'Life']",Boys to Men
