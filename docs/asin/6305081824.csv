Having the opportunity to have seen the original production of Nunsense on 1992 in New York, this presentation brings many memories to mind. Although not exactly how the original show was conceived, it still has the pizzaz of the original one.

The songs are good, the comedy includes everything from great to groaners. The performances are uniformally excellent.  Rue McClanahan is great as the Mother Superior and shows how good a comedienne she was and how she'll be missed.  But the real scene stealer is the Semina De Laurentis as Sister Marionette.  I've seen revivals of the show and no one has come close to this hilarious performance.  Also great is Christine Anderson and Terry White (who I just saw in the revival of Follies).  This isn't new but the picture and sound are very good.  Originally shown on A&E when it actually showed Arts and Entertainment--a long time ago.
