The writing is absolutely brilliant and keeps viewers off-balance until the very last, chair-clinging moment. Full blown characterizations, thanks to the great actors AND great writing! I loved each and every episode, EXCEPT the final....which was, by Medium standards,even more odd and convoluted than ever. But, I have to reluctantly admit,  it was in keeping with the series as a whole.Many of us faithful viewers wrote(emailed) to protest Medium's cancellation and low-and-behold it was brought back to life on another network! Brilliant! The viewers spoke and(finally) someone listened.

Liked it so much, I felt it was more cost effective to get the whole pack instead of buying these one at or two at a time. Good premise and creative stories and keeping it real. It is as much a story about a family as a crime show. Keeps it diverse. The second season had the stories com from different angles in the way it was written and shot. One episode was done twice. The second they did the first HD 3D on television. I have never seen a 3D movie in my whole life.
