For a man pushing seventy years I'm impressed with his performance, and with the video quality.I'll agree with an earlier reviewer that the audio quality is not superb, though more than adequate- (perhaps the reviewer's audio system is not set up well, or he pushed the wrong buttons on the remote & channeled all the sound to the center). When I select the multichannel option I have to turn my Sony Amp's volume as high as 35 to get the volume I desire.  Compare that to Collective Soul's Home Blu-Ray disk where I only need 14 on the volume dial.

Even though Diamond is known for doing great shows their power has not translated to video very well (see Greatest Hits Live). It can now be said that there is a Diamond concert video that captures the intensity of an actual show.Shot by Hamish Hamilton,Hot August Night:NYC gives us a glimpse of the 2008 Tour in front of a hometown crowd who is in love with the entertainer. The show capures twenty-eight songs in just over two hours as Diamond takes us through most of his catalogue from his earliest hits to his latest Home Before Dark material. Backed by the band that has supported him for the past thirty years or so Diamond makes it look easy. The high point of the show is a rousing mid set Sweet Caroline that has the entire arena on its feet.The only bonus feature is Neil Diamond Coming Home which takes the singer back to his old  Brooklyn neighborhood and apartment fifty years later.This is a worthwhile DVD to watch if you have an interest in one of America's most known singer songwriters.",4,IT Was A Hot Augiust Night,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1080,"['Neil', 'Diamond', 'videos', 'have', 'been', 'sort', 'hit', 'miss', 'affairs', 'years', 'Even', 'Diamond', 'known', 'doing', 'great', 'shows', 'power', 'not', 'translated', 'video', 'very', 'well', 'see', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'Live', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'said', 'Diamond', 'concert', 'video', 'intensity', 'actual', 'show.Shot', 'Hamish', 'Hamilton', 'Hot', 'August', 'Night', 'NYC', 'glimpse', '2008', 'Tour', 'front', 'hometown', 'crowd', 'who', 'love', 'entertainer', 'show', 'twenty-eight', 'songs', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'Diamond', 'most', 'catalogue', 'earliest', 'hits', 'latest', 'Home', 'Dark', 'material', 'Backed', 'band', 'supported', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'so', 'Diamond', 'look', 'easy', 'high', 'point', 'show', 'rousing', 'mid', 'set', 'Sweet', 'Caroline', 'entire', 'arena', 'feet.The', 'only', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'Coming', 'Home', 'singer', 'back', 'old', 'Brooklyn', 'neighborhood', 'apartment', 'fifty', 'years', 'later.This', 'worthwhile', 'DVD', 'watch', 'have', 'interest', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'known', 'singer', 'songwriters']",Neil Diamond: Hot August Night NYC- Live from Madison Square Garden

1315037,A1O96LY5TIREBT,B0030BOCE6,"Chhan Thuan Kiat ""Pediatrician & music nut""","[10, 10]","First off, let me say this, never mind what else you've read, this blu ray disc's surround audio is very good, not perfect but say a 4 or a 4 1/2 out of 5. I played it on a PS 3 connected HDMI to a digital amp with ability to decode the usual and the more recent audio formats and have this to report. The LPCM 2.0 output played through the stereo mode of the amp is satisfactory but nothing to shout about -- stable sound imaging, but congested with slightly boomy bass at higher volume. The Dolby True HD 5.1 output when I perversely played it through the 2 channel mode of the amp sounded worse. The sound was muffled with poor stereo image and sounded awful enough for me to switch off in a hurry. But this same True HD 5.1.output when properly decoded and played through the 5.1. mode of the amp brought back the smile to my face. The differential output through the various speakers varies of course with the track played but generally is about 20-25% each from R and L front, 15-20% subwoofer, 10-15% each from R and L rear speakers and only 10-15% from the central speaker. Despite this timid output from the centre however, the stereo imaging from the 2 front speakers is excellent and the vocals from Diamond and the backup singers are easily discernible even with the full band playing, down to the last p's and t's and sibilants. This type of mix is much preferable to one with a strong centre speaker output which overwhelms and destroys the stereo illusion (for audiophiles getting a centre speaker is akin to getting the bubonic plague). The interesting thing about this particular 5.1 mix is that whilst it uses the centre sparingly as an in between ""filler"", it uses it more as an ambience channel. Listen to tracks with strong audience noise like claps and whistles and sing-alongs and you'll notice strong ambient noise coming from the centre. This, I think is to convey the illusion of sitting in the front row facing the stage in the gold fish bowl that is Madison Square Garden where of course the ambient noise surrounds you 360 degrees ! Good sound then and not a bad sound stage either.The video quality is more of a mixed bag. When the lighting is just right you get the high def picture you expect from a blu ray but oftentimes when Diamond moves to a darker area the picture is noticeably softer and some long shots of the audience in poor light show up fuzzy and grainy. A 4 out of 5 perhaps.But nitpicking aside it is the performance that matters most, and man can this guy perform ! Whether it is in the all out sock-it-to-'em numbers such as Holly Holly, Cherry Cherry, Crunchy Granola Suite and Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show, or in the declamatory I am...I Said, or the syrupy Sweet Caroline or the intimate You Don't Bring Me Flowers, Neil Diamond sizzles, the band is hot and the audience laps everything up clamoring for more, more. What a night. Diamond seldom ever disappoints in a live concert, and this performance is a real gem, 5 carats and all of flawless.",5,Diamond sparkles ----what a beautiful noise !,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",2010,3010,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'never', 'mind', 'what', 'else', ""'ve"", 'read', 'blu', 'disc', 'surround', 'audio', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'say', '4', '4', '1/2', '5', 'played', 'PS', '3', 'connected', 'HDMI', 'digital', 'amp', 'ability', 'decode', 'usual', 'more', 'recent', 'audio', 'formats', 'have', 'report', 'LPCM', '2.0', 'output', 'played', 'stereo', 'mode', 'amp', 'satisfactory', 'nothing', 'shout', 'about', 'stable', 'sound', 'imaging', 'congested', 'slightly', 'boomy', 'bass', 'higher', 'volume', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'output', 'when', 'perversely', 'played', '2', 'channel', 'mode', 'amp', 'sounded', 'worse', 'sound', 'was', 'muffled', 'poor', 'stereo', 'image', 'sounded', 'awful', 'enough', 'switch', 'off', 'hurry', 'same', 'True', 'HD', '5.1.output', 'when', 'properly', 'decoded', 'played', '5.1.', 'mode', 'amp', 'brought', 'back', 'smile', 'face', 'differential', 'output', 'various', 'speakers', 'varies', 'course', 'track', 'played', 'generally', '20-25', '%', 'R', 'L', 'front', '15-20', '%', 'subwoofer', '10-15', '%', 'R', 'L', 'rear', 'speakers', 'only', '10-15', '%', 'central', 'speaker', 'timid', 'output', 'centre', 'however', 'stereo', 'imaging', '2', 'front', 'speakers', 'excellent', 'vocals', 'Diamond', 'backup', 'singers', 'are', 'easily', 'discernible', 'even', 'full', 'band', 'playing', 'down', 'last', 'p', 't', 'sibilants', 'type', 'mix', 'much', 'preferable', 'one', 'strong', 'centre', 'speaker', 'output', 'overwhelms', 'stereo', 'illusion', 'audiophiles', 'getting', 'centre', 'speaker', 'akin', 'getting', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'interesting', 'thing', 'particular', '5.1', 'mix', 'whilst', 'centre', 'sparingly', 'filler', 'more', 'ambience', 'channel', 'Listen', 'tracks', 'strong', 'audience', 'noise', 'claps', 'whistles', 'sing-alongs', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'strong', 'ambient', 'noise', 'coming', 'centre', 'think', 'convey', 'illusion', 'sitting', 'front', 'row', 'facing', 'stage', 'gold', 'fish', 'bowl', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'where', 'course', 'ambient', 'noise', '360', 'degrees', 'Good', 'sound', 'then', 'not', 'bad', 'sound', 'stage', 'either.The', 'video', 'quality', 'more', 'mixed', 'bag', 'When', 'lighting', 'just', 'right', 'get', 'high', 'def', 'picture', 'expect', 'blu', 'ray', 'oftentimes', 'when', 'Diamond', 'darker', 'area', 'picture', 'noticeably', 'softer', 'long', 'shots', 'audience', 'poor', 'light', 'show', 'up', 'fuzzy', 'grainy', '4', '5', 'perhaps.But', 'nitpicking', 'performance', 'most', 'man', 'can', 'guy', 'perform', ""sock-it-to-'em"", 'numbers', 'such', 'Holly', 'Holly', 'Cherry', 'Cherry', 'Crunchy', 'Granola', 'Suite', 'Brother', 'Love', 'Travelling', 'Salvation', 'Show', 'declamatory', 'am', 'Said', 'syrupy', 'Sweet', 'Caroline', 'intimate', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bring', 'Me', 'Flowers', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'sizzles', 'band', 'hot', 'audience', 'laps', 'everything', 'up', 'clamoring', 'more', 'more', 'What', 'night', 'Diamond', 'seldom', 'ever', 'disappoints', 'live', 'concert', 'performance', 'real', 'gem', '5', 'carats', 'flawless']",Neil Diamond: Hot August Night NYC- Live from Madison Square Garden

The great thing about this DVD/Blu-ray is that it is the only video I am aware of where we have a complete Neil Diamond concert. So I will rate in 3 categories.Performance - Neil has been around for some time now. It has been awhile since the first Hot August Night. But luckily, he was in great voice for this concert. Much better than when I saw him live in Denver. Fans will not be disappointed. Full length concert in hi-def, does not get much better for fans.Video - I would rate a little lower than I was hoping for here. Not quite as sharp as the best concerts, and some cameras were not as focused as others. But on most TVs, this will be a very pleasant picture.Audio - again I have some minor issue here. Another review indicated the sound on the true 5.1 track is mostly center channel and almost no rears. Not sure how his system is set up, but that is not the case. The Blu-ray and DVD 5.1 tracks seem to be mastered about the same. The center channel is actually barely used. Vocal comes out of both left and right mains. Sound stage is all in front. Rears are fully engaged but used for arena ambience and crowd noise. Overall the sound is good, but vocals should be in the center channel, and overall sound is not quite as dynamic as the best concerts videos.All said...a must for Neil Diamond fans.",4,Neil at his best,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,1403,"['First', 'am', 'lifelong', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'fan', 'saw', 'exact', 'concert', 'here', 'Denver', 'great', 'thing', 'DVD/Blu-ray', 'only', 'video', 'am', 'aware', 'where', 'have', 'complete', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'concert', 'will', 'rate', '3', 'categories.Performance', 'Neil', 'been', 'time', 'now', 'been', 'awhile', 'first', 'Hot', 'August', 'Night', 'luckily', 'was', 'great', 'voice', 'concert', 'Much', 'better', 'when', 'saw', 'live', 'Denver', 'Fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Full', 'length', 'concert', 'hi-def', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'fans.Video', 'would', 'rate', 'little', 'lower', 'was', 'hoping', 'here', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'sharp', 'best', 'concerts', 'cameras', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'focused', 'others', 'most', 'TVs', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'pleasant', 'picture.Audio', 'again', 'have', 'minor', 'issue', 'here', 'review', 'indicated', 'sound', 'true', '5.1', 'track', 'mostly', 'center', 'channel', 'almost', 'rears', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'system', 'set', 'up', 'not', 'case', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', '5.1', 'tracks', 'seem', 'be', 'mastered', 'same', 'center', 'channel', 'actually', 'barely', 'used', 'Vocal', 'left', 'right', 'mains', 'Sound', 'stage', 'front', 'Rears', 'are', 'fully', 'engaged', 'used', 'arena', 'ambience', 'crowd', 'noise', 'sound', 'good', 'vocals', 'should', 'be', 'center', 'channel', 'overall', 'sound', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'dynamic', 'best', 'concerts', 'videos.All', 'said', 'must', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'fans']",Neil Diamond: Hot August Night NYC- Live from Madison Square Garden
