These men served their country well.  They used so much stock footage that I felt like I was cutting to old John Wayne movies and back to a modern one.Still very worth your time to watch.,4,The story it tells is excellent.

Provides a good chance to share with youngsters of the significance of Black participation in the Navy, Coast Guard, Marines.  What is seen more often are accounts of those in the Army or the Airforce.  So, it's forgotten that Black men (and women) fought in the other branches of the armed forces too.

979396,A1WC03DMROIHB5,B000EWBKI0,S. Cowen,"[2, 3]","Based on the true and heroic story of the USS Mason, a Navy battleship manned by an African-American crew during WWII, when segregation was still enforced. Based on the book by Mary Pat Kelly.The prosSome pretty solid performances by the cast. Some scenes were very enjoyable. Nice to see a all African American cast and no one is a drug dealer,pimp or thug. Glad to see these events portrayed on film. The scene with them visiting some Irish people was very enjoyable. Footage of actual navy vessels in battle. Ending of the film has footage of Bill Clinton talking with some of the surviving crew members.The consI hated how they couldn't decide if they wanted to be documentary or a movie. You have Ossie Davis talking all over the film explaining things I don't need that just show what happened in the film. Man the sets were kind of cheap in the film. You could tell they didn't have much money for this film. I didn't get some of the choices in term of script. They wasted a lot of time with one character interviewing other charters in the film. This happened a few times. I'd have rather they spent this time doing something more interesting. Also during the battle scenes they use actually footage of real navy ships in battle. This would be cool if the scenes weren't in black and white. I found this really jarring at times. It really took me out of the battles. Also the main antagonist who was causing them problems get taken out of the picture 40% into the film. I know it's based on real life,but it hurt the film. You don't get rid of the main bad guy so soon.In conclusion I'd say good idea with poor execution. Don't know why some people gave it such a high rating,but don't be fooled.",2,"A decent film.
