1322355,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B0034G4OYA,Andre Dursin,"[0, 0]","HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA, last fall's box-office hit from animator/director Genndy Tartakovsky and producer Adam Sandler, proves to be surprising fun. While animated at younger viewers, there's plenty of old-fashioned Movie Monster mayhem here to please fans of the Universal era with Count Dracula (voiced by Sandler) about to celebrate his daughter's 118th birthday by staging a massive party at his Transylvanian hotel, one devoted exclusively to Drac's monster pals. Crashing their undead-only event comes a young American backpacker (voiced by Andy Samberg) who develops an immediate attraction to the birthday girl, but Dracula quickly douses the happy-go-lucky kid in Frankenstein make-up so his human identity won't be revealed to the insular monster community.Peter Baynham and comedian Robert Smigel are credited with the script for ""Hotel Transylvania,"" which - although saddled with a conventional and predictable story line - makes for good fun thanks to amusing humor and Tartakovsky's engaging animation, here rendered in 3-D CGI form. The filmmakers put a modern, comedic spin on the great monsters of the Golden Age (envisioning the Wolfman as a harried family man, for example) and punctuate the material with snappy visual gags and atmosphere that recalls a good Looney Tunes or Tex Avery cartoon spoofing the Karloff age. Naturally, kids will be the most receptive to ""Hotel Transylvania""'s charms, but that's of course the point: between the good-natured comedy and colorful design, it's no surprise younger viewers preferred this over Tim Burton's well-meaning but decidedly more downbeat ""Frankenweenie"" in theaters last fall.Sony brings ""Hotel Transylvania"" to Blu-Ray this week in the form of a multi-disc 3D/2D presentation with corresponding DVD and Ultraviolet copies. Though produced to utilize 3D from the outset, there's little lost in the 2D Blu-Ray presentation since there are few pop-out effects.

The traditional monsters that we have known, (werewolf, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, mummy, invisible man, witches, gremlins, zombies, etc.) are not the evil beings that we are used to. Instead, they are just plain folks, but have been hunted and killed by human beings in the past. So Dracula has constructed a secret sanctuary where the monsters can come and chill out and he is a hotel manager a la Faultty Towers. Dracula is also superprotective of his daughter, Mavis, who has just turned (1)18 and who wants to go out into the world. Initially, the movie revolves around him being the hotel manager, and, in keeping his daughter safe.Enter a human teenage boy, who wanders into the place and initially believes that everyone is wearing a costume. He meets Mavis and they instantly fall for each other, much to Dracula's irritation. He tries to get rid of the boy without the guests realizing that the hotel has been infected by a human and I will say no more.Overall, it is a very good film, with only a couple of cliches here and there, with lots of visual and verbal jokes throughout. The werewolf, in particular, is hilarious. The film gets the conflict across very well of the dilemma of wanting to keep your family safe, yet realizing that the youngster must be allowed to spread their (bat)wings.",4,A different take on monsters,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,1371,"['kids', 'especially', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'loved', 'movie', 'traditional', 'monsters', 'have', 'known', 'werewolf', 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'mummy', 'invisible', 'man', 'witches', 'gremlins', 'zombies', 'etc', 'are', 'not', 'evil', 'beings', 'are', 'used', 'Instead', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'folks', 'have', 'been', 'hunted', 'killed', 'human', 'beings', 'past', 'So', 'Dracula', 'constructed', 'secret', 'sanctuary', 'where', 'monsters', 'can', 'come', 'chill', 'out', 'hotel', 'manager', 'la', 'Faultty', 'Towers', 'Dracula', 'also', 'superprotective', 'daughter', 'Mavis', 'who', 'just', 'turned', '1', '18', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'world', 'Initially', 'movie', 'being', 'hotel', 'manager', 'keeping', 'daughter', 'safe.Enter', 'human', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'place', 'initially', 'everyone', 'wearing', 'costume', 'Mavis', 'instantly', 'fall', 'other', 'much', 'Dracula', 'irritation', 'get', 'rid', 'boy', 'guests', 'realizing', 'hotel', 'been', 'infected', 'human', 'will', 'say', 'more.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'couple', 'cliches', 'here', 'there', 'lots', 'visual', 'verbal', 'jokes', 'werewolf', 'particular', 'hilarious', 'film', 'conflict', 'very', 'well', 'dilemma', 'wanting', 'keep', 'family', 'safe', 'yet', 'realizing', 'youngster', 'must', 'be', 'allowed', 'spread', 'bat', 'wings']",N/A

I watched it with another adult and we couldn't believe the shallowness of the paternal value-system this film portrayed. I'm not interested in hearing &#34;it's just a kids movie&#34; from people unconcerned about the potential influence of cinema on child development. That makes it all the worse. Hosts of youth-oriented films are released every year that make some effort to respect the youth they are primarily directed at. This film's &#34;messages&#34; were ridiculous and insulting to today's aspiring young women. Even the most jaded parent can't possibly believe teaching a young adolescent they will only have one shot at true love is a good thing. I knew a middle schooler (many years ago) who killed himself, at least in part, because he apparently believed that very thing when his young love relationship went to pieces. The teen oriented, female character in this film apparently has no ambition beyond living under her father's controlling cape until she can one day venture out and get married. Heaven forbid she go to monster school and grow up to practice law. The other, more promising theme of the storyline, vaguely alluding to reconciliation between different groups and shelving longstanding prejudices, plays second fiddle to the daughter's storyline - and frankly becomes largely lost in the frenetic visuals of the film and endless stream of (almost entirely unfunny) attempts at on-screen humor. Come on - they included nearly the entire Universal monsters pantheon. . .and this was the best they could do?The vacant storyline aside, visually the film looks great. The 3D version has some nice effects. The voices are done reasonably well. A couple of scenes went on - in my opinion - a little too long and watching it started to feel like a chore after a while, but the effects kept it marginally engaging.

It always found its way into the upcoming section but nothing wad ever said about it. This went on for yeats and I had no idea it was an animated film.Anyway, enough of that. Animated movies these days try too hard in all of the wrong areas. Many seem to throw in long sections of drama and can leave the audience in tears. When you sit down as a family to watch a movie with your kids, do you really want them crying during the cartoon because the filmmakers decided to throw in too many tear-jerk moments? No. They're supposed to be a fun movie that brings laughable moments aplenty that can be enjoyed by everyone. Hotel Transylvania is exactly what it looks like. A cute family movie that has a great story and cast with loads and loads of laughs that can be enjoyed by all. I was pleasantly surprised and highly recommend this one.

1322423,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0034G4OYA,Chris Kennison,"[2, 4]","Sony Pictures Animation has never actually been able to keep up with the other big boy animators on the block. Movies like ""Surf's Up"", ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", ""The Smurfs"", ""Arthur Christmas"" and ""Pirates!"" never met the critical acclaim or the wide acceptance of some of the movies from Disney, Pixar or even Universal. Yet, teaming up with Columbia Pictures on ""Hotel Transylvania"" may have been a really good move.With the voice talents of Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Cee Loo Green, Selena Gomez, Steve Buscemi and David Spade, ""Hote Transylvania"" has something for everybody. There were times in the film that I was a little overwhelmed with the constant bombardment of characters and jokes, but eventually the movie settled down and capitalized off of some character development and brought some pretty good heart to the story.""Hotel Transylvania"" has a lot of story and back-story, but it is all well explained and not your typical simple animated storyline. Dracula is raising his daughter, alone, so he builds a castle in the middle of Pennsylvania, fortified by rows and miles of zombie cemeteries and ghost forests. His hotel has become a fortress to keep he, his fellow monsters and most importantly, his daughter safe from the hateful murderous humans. His daughter is getting older though, she's 118 now and she has become too curious about the outside world and she wonders if humans are really how they've been portrayed.""Hotel Transylvania"" is the Muppets, animated. There are a slew of characters who have gathered in one place for the birthday party of the century. All of the characters have their own personality and it reminded me of the Muppets as I watched it play out. Dracula, I compared to Kermit, trying to hold the show together as the onslaught of characters and personalities clashed. The jokes are fast and furious. Many of them aren't that funny, but I did notice that many of the jokes were tailored toward adults and many were ones that kids would find gut tickling.Ultimately though, ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a fun trip to the movies for all ages. Is it hilarious? I wouldn't say so. At times I found it funny, but when it was all said and done, I was sold on the personality and the heart behind it. Despite all the silliness and the constant playing up to the kids of our age with the music and the hyperactivity, somewhere in there, there was a whole lot of heart behind it all.",4,"JUST OKAY FUNNY, but loaded with a lot of blood pumping HEART",1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,2443,"['Sony', 'Pictures', 'Animation', 'never', 'actually', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'other', 'big', 'boy', 'animators', 'block', 'Movies', 'Surf', 'Up', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'Smurfs', 'Arthur', 'Christmas', 'Pirates', 'never', 'met', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'wide', 'acceptance', 'movies', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'even', 'Universal', 'teaming', 'up', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'move.With', 'voice', 'talents', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'Cee', 'Loo', 'Green', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'David', 'Spade', 'Hote', 'Transylvania', 'something', 'everybody', 'were', 'times', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'overwhelmed', 'constant', 'bombardment', 'characters', 'jokes', 'eventually', 'movie', 'settled', 'down', 'capitalized', 'character', 'development', 'brought', 'pretty', 'good', 'heart', 'story', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'lot', 'story', 'back-story', 'well', 'explained', 'not', 'typical', 'simple', 'animated', 'storyline', 'Dracula', 'raising', 'daughter', 'alone', 'castle', 'middle', 'Pennsylvania', 'fortified', 'rows', 'miles', 'zombie', 'cemeteries', 'ghost', 'forests', 'hotel', 'become', 'fortress', 'keep', 'fellow', 'monsters', 'most', 'importantly', 'daughter', 'safe', 'hateful', 'murderous', 'humans', 'daughter', 'getting', 'older', '118', 'now', 'become', 'too', 'curious', 'outside', 'world', 'humans', 'are', 'really', 'how', ""'ve"", 'been', 'portrayed', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'Muppets', 'animated', 'are', 'slew', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'gathered', 'one', 'place', 'birthday', 'party', 'century', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'personality', 'reminded', 'Muppets', 'watched', 'play', 'out', 'Dracula', 'compared', 'Kermit', 'trying', 'hold', 'show', 'together', 'onslaught', 'characters', 'personalities', 'clashed', 'jokes', 'are', 'fast', 'furious', 'Many', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'did', 'notice', 'many', 'jokes', 'were', 'tailored', 'adults', 'many', 'were', 'ones', 'kids', 'would', 'find', 'gut', 'tickling.Ultimately', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'fun', 'trip', 'movies', 'ages', 'hilarious', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'so', 'times', 'found', 'funny', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'was', 'sold', 'personality', 'heart', 'silliness', 'constant', 'playing', 'up', 'kids', 'age', 'music', 'hyperactivity', 'somewhere', 'there', 'was', 'whole', 'lot', 'heart']",N/A

Ad...","[1, 2]","I have to be honest - there is nothing seriously flawed with this movie at all, it is just  that I  didn't think it was that great.The plot is pretty simple( as it often the case in animated family movies).In this case, Count Dracula doesn't want his baby girl- MAVIS- who is finally turning 118 yrs old( no typo there)- to grow up and go out in the world.The world is an unfriendly place, especially to monsters like them.  Dracula is a doting dad ever fearful of losing his girl.He has already lost too much in his life and he dreads the idea of her desire to spread her little bat wings and fly out, on her own.What is nice is that while this is an animated movie- it touches on a theme all loving parents can relate to.NO PARENT WHO ADORES THEIR KID(S) REALLY WANTS THEM TO LEAVE  HOME FOR GOOD AND CERTAINLY, THEY FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY IN THAT BIG, WIDE WORLD OUT THERE.The computer graphics are very well done and Adam Sandler is almost unrecognizable as the voice of Count Dracula, except  for those moments while watching, when you suddenly remember he is playing Dracula. :-)He did a good job of disappearing right into the role.( You will be surprised by the many stars who played various monster voices for this movie).I did find a lot of the action sequences a bit dizzying and I am all for action in regular movies, but in an animated film, it all felt a bit overwhelming visually.Almost like your eyes can't follow the action fast enough.The entire movie roughly covers Mavis' big birthday bash.The one her father has planned for her 118th birthday.He has gone through great lengths to make it special, all the while trying to hide his great fear of her desire to go out and explore the world.  He knows she is going to undoubtedly bring this desire up to him, now that she is 118.All starts out smoothly for the party, until an unsuspecting interloper some how gets into the Hotel Transylvania- a Hotel dedicated  to being a safe and peaceful haven strictly for vacationing monsters of all sorts.Having an intruder show up, is where the story takes a wild turn and the action gets really crazy.Loved the ending sequence of the movie- the music was great if you are of the right age to enjoy it. May  not be everyone's bag, but for those who found their foot taping or their leg bouncing, you might want to check the film's soundtrack info on AMAZON.I know there was a lot of praise for this movie, so maybe my expectations were just a bit too high.

Featured in the film are Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, CeeLo Green, Jon Lovitz and  Chris Parnell.  The film was produced by Michelle Murdocca and executive produced by Adam Sandler and Robert Smigel.""Hotel Transylvania"" is an animated comedy about Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler), who is the owner and creator of Hotel Transylvania, a five-star resort for fellow monsters, to keep them safe from human civilization.On a special day to celebrate his daughter Mavis' (voiced by Selena Gomez) 118th birthday, Dracula invites his friends Frankenstein (voiced by Kevin James) and his wife Eunice (voiced by Fran Drescher), Murray the Mummy (voiced by Cee Lo Green), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (voiced by Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon), Griffin the Invisble Man (voiced by David Spade), Bigfoot, Steve the Blob and other monsters.But for Mavis, what she wants for her birthday, now that she is grown up, is to explore the outside world and see the human world.But being a single father and also a strict father to Mavis, Dracula doesn't want her to because he believes the humans want the monsters dead.But Dracula comes up with a plan, to let her wander out for her first time to a nearby village, but what Mavis doesn't know is that the inhabitants are also monsters and part of Dracula's plan to have his daughters stay home.  And he succeeds.But when a human named Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg), who is exploring the nearby forest, follows staff to Hotel Transylvania, Dracula tries to hide him from other monsters, worrying that a human might set off chaos as the monsters may think the humans are there to kill them.  So, Dracula disguises Jonathan as a Flesh Golem named Johnny-stein and has Frankenstein thinking that Johnny-stein is a relative.And with Jonathan's presence in Hotel Transylvania, Jonathan is able to liven up the festivity by introducing them to modern rock and dance music and how to have fun and eventually charming everyone including Dracula's daughter, Mavis.Seeing that both Mavis and Jonathan are getting close, Dracula tells Jonathan to please stay away from his daughter.  And when Jonathan wants to know why, Dracula reveals a tragic past of why Mavis' mother is no longer living and how that tragedy ties to humans.Not wanting to hurt Dracula, Jonathan is willing to do what Dracula says and distance himself from Mavis, despite her falling in love with him.  But when Chef Quasimodo (voiced by Jon Lovitz) finds out that there is a human in Hotel Transylvania, he wants to cook him up.  And with Jonathan captured, can Dracula save him from harm, but also keep his human existence hidden from the monsters at the hotel?VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Hotel Transylvania"" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen and English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.

Also, ""Hotel Transylvania"" will be released on Blu-ray 3D for those who do have an 3D enabled Blu-ray player and television.As for the DVD, let me just say that Sony Pictures Animation/Sony Pictures imageworks did a fantastic job with this film.  From the character design to the amount of detail seen n the film, while those watching it in HD, will see much more detail, the DVD still looks good.  Really good use of warm and cool colors throughout the film.

For children, the usually creepy characters such as Frankenstein, the Mummy, the Werewolf, etc. are presented in a non-threatening manner.  If anything, the film tries to show Dracula and the monsters as fearful of humans and are trying to protect their kind from being killed by humans.  In fact, Dracula doesn't even suck human blood and if anything, the monsters are portrayed more as a non-threatening endangered species who just want to be left alone.And part of the storyline revolves around a controlling and fearful father, Dracula, who cares deeply for his daughter Mavis.  But as Mavis is old enough to explore the world on her own and wants to get out and see it, it's about one father trying his best not to lose his daughter but also a fear that by exploring the world outside Hotel Transylvania, she may meet the same fate as Dracula's wife, who was killed by humans.But life changes for Mavis when she comes across a guy named Jonathan, who happens to be a human.""Hotel Transylvania"" doesn't try to become an animated film that tries to tug on emotional sympathy.  The characters are eccentric, while rated-PG, the characters were made to be more upbeat and naive.  And parents, while rated PG, most of the film is not threatening.  Possible scenes that children may get scared at is Dracula turning into a vampire bat, pretend zombies being  accidentally burned by flames but there is no death but the story of Dracula discussing his wife's tragedy.Character animation is pleasing and for the most part, this film is upbeat, fun and just an entertaining film that is meant to entertain children.  No deep or complex story, no emotional storyline, just a straight-up story about a human who accidentally wanders into Hotel Transylvania and Dracula trying to find a way to keep him concealed from his guests and also prevent him getting close to his only daughter.Voice acting for the most part is done well by its cast of big names such as Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, David Spade, Fran Derescher, CeeLo Green, Chris Parnell to name a few.As for the DVD, the Blu-ray release actually is better in terms of picture quality, lossless audio soundtrack and more special features.  The DVD does look good but doesn't come with all the special features as its Blu-ray counterpart.Overall, ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a good film that features a lot of entertaining and fun moments.  It's a bit silly but children will love the fart jokes, the humor and the pleasing animation.  Parents shouldn't worry too much and there is no major violence or anything too scary but for those the scenes I mentioned earlier, parental guidance is suggested.A fun family film for the entire family, ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a beautifully animated film from Sony Pictures Animation and Sony Pictures Imageworks, that will make children laugh from beginning to end!An entertaining animated film worth checking out!",4,"A fun family film for the entire family, ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a beautifully animated film!",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,8789,"['Genndy', 'Tartakovsky', 'director',

1322470,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0034G4OYA,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[2, 3]","-------------------------------------------------------""Hotel Transylvania""(Sony Animation, 2012)-------------------------------------------------------This kid-oriented animated comedy was an unexpected pleasure -- I went into it with my kid with mild dread, but enjoyed it from start to finish, and left the theater in a great mood. ""Hotel Transylvania"" is an extended spoof of classic monster-movie characters -- Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Mummy, The Blob, et al -- with lots of unsubtle though entertaining jokes based on their various traits , and a simple, wholesome message about parents and kids learning to respect and love one another.The story centers on daddy Dracula, who has retreated from the world and holed up in a remote castle which he built as a refuge for monsters who want a break from the hatred and persecution of monster-fearing, violent humans, and more importantly as a well-feathered nest for his daughter Mavis who -- at 118 years old -- wants to finally go see the world, but is still held back by her overprotective dad. Mavis is a stylish, laconic, Goth-y gal, sort of like the Incredibles' Violet but with a hipper haircut and some really cute little fangs. Like most of the characters, she isn't overdone; the tone is just right, as it is for her dad who, even though he's overbearing, is entirely likable and sympathetic. The script cheerfully traffics in formula and affectionately crafted cliches, as well as a nonstop barrage of inoffensive, kid-friendly humor (a few fart jokes, but nothing worse than that). It was just the right tone for families with younger children who want a macabre, monster-y theme, but don't want to get all Tim Burton-ed-out and irony-laden about it and don't want to see anything genuinely scary. If you liked ""Monsters Inc."" you'll probably enjoy this as well -- it's not as great a movie, but it's nice, light fun and works as well for Father's Day as for Halloween. Recommended!

This year's gathering is special: the (1)18th birthday of Dracula's cute daughter Mavis, who can't wait to get out and explore the world.  Her overly protective father has already lost a wife to an angry human mob and goes to great (and humorous) lengths to keep Mavis around the castle.  An uninvited guest in the form of a hipster young human male backpacker changes all that...The animation is superb.  The cartoon monsters look incredibly life-like as they sing, dance, and squabble.  Among the guests at the hotel are the Mummy and his mate, Mr. and Mrs. Frankenstein, the Invisible Man, the Blob, and the Werewolf and his wife and pile of rambuctious pups.  There is an endless series of sight gags, ripped off from every monster movie ever made.  The excellent voic cast includes Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and Selena Gomez.

First the story is about all the classic monsters, second it had a cast I loved. People like Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, and David Spade among many more had me excited for this. Plus who doesn&#8217;t like a good animated film, I for one love them. So when it was released to theaters we loaded up with my little cuz and went to see it. Turns out we all loved it, especially when Drac freaks out and the screen goes red [u know what I am talking about].The film tells the story of Dracula who after his wife was killed many moons ago decided that all humans were evil. So he decided to build a place that would keep his daughter and fellow monster safe from the outside world. This place was called Hotel Transylvania and all was right with the world, until the &#8220;outside&#8221; world made its way in. When a human kid named Jonathan shows up and Drac&#8217;s daughter Mavis takes an interest in him things in Dracula&#8217;s world turns upside down.This was a fun movie that featured all the classic monsters plus many more and all of them are great. Also add in that the voice acting and writing is great and you got a good film. The only thing left you need is the animation, thankfully it is wonderful here. Sony made sure of that with Happy Madison and had the film directed by the creator of &#8220;Samurai Jack&#8221; and &#8220;Dexter&#8217;s Laboratory&#8221;, love both of those shows.

But enough about us...on to Hotel Transylvania. It basically tells the story of Count Dracula (not the Bela Lugosi type, but more the Gary Oldman type from the ultra-erotic Bram Stoker's Dracula!) throwing a birthday shindig in order to commemorate the coming-out party of his only daughter, Beavis. She will be coming out as a 118-year-old lady vampire. Of course, this being a borderline-monster type of movie, all the guests are some of the most diabolical and horrifying monsters that you can think of, such as Nosferatu, the Basilisk, Satan himself, Goatman from Maryland, the Abominable Snowman, Nessie, and, in a totally weird casting move, Scooby Doo.However, along comes Jonathan, voiced by the lovably clumsy, liberal, Obama-supporting comedian Andrake Samberg. Jonathan and Beavis begin to feel sexually attracted to each other, which is where Count Dracula comes in: He tries everything in his undead and evil power to make sure that Jonathan and Beavis don't end up sleeping together! To do this, he enlists the help of Lon Chaney's the Wolfman and Boris Karloff's Frankenstein's Monster. The three of them ambush Jonathan, beat him up, and, finally, tie a block of cement to his feet and throw him into the Danube River.All in all, I thought that Hotel Transylvania's strength was to be found in its sociopolitical message, which is likely too lofty for kids to understand. The way I interpreted it, Hotel Transylvania is really about the ""high life"" in America and all of the greed, excess and obsession with money that goes along with it. See, some of you inobservant watchers probably failed to note this, but in the song that plays over the closing credits, there is the line ""you can check out any time, but you can never leave.""

It started off interesting, but quickly devolved into fart jokes, puerile script tailored to kids, and blah character design. (The design of the teenage boy was awful - he looked like a generic blob for most of the movie (until his hair was restored to normal) - and the Count himself looked pretty blah, too. The bat-daughter was cute, though.)All that aside, the dialogue was, for the most part, terrible (for adults, anyway). Some animated features, like Shrek and Toy Story, successfully walk the line to make it entertaining for adults as well; this one doesn't succeed. The humor and script are for kids. If this is your main concern, this movie may keep them entertained. Although you will have to explain that humans killed the Count's wife.There are some funny bits, like the Count's boring party games, or The Fly's translation of Igor.Some of the action gags are too fast to see. Zip-zip-zip and it's over.The messages, for what it's worth: 1. Let your kid live their lives however they want. 2. Loud music is more fun. Old music is boring. 3. Today, the world is safer for monsters - we love monsters rather than want to kill them.

1322536,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0034G4OYA,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","In a bit of a swerve, it is the monsters who fear the humans, fear their mob mentality and the pitchforks and the torches. Hidden from the human world, Hotel Transylvania stands as the last sanctuary for monsters. It is haven from human persecution. Its proprietor, Count Dracula, boasts that his hotel has been human-free since 1898. At that moment, all the monster kids in the theater watching the film probably felt a twinge of unease. Duhn-DUHN!-duhn.Dracula has a daughter of whom he is overprotective. To celebrate his daughter Mavis's 118th birthday, he throws a bash and invites all the horror staples from Universal Studios. Drac is one of those party hosts you just want to smack upside the head, what with his rigidly structured planning and the epic lameness of his party activities. On a more personal note, he persists in denying Mavis (Selena Gomez) her freedom. She's so curious about the humans. She longs to travel the world and experience exotic cultures and mingle with different folks. He keeps warning her of how so very dangerous humans are. Who knows how long things would have remained at status quo? But then Hotel Transylvania gets an unexpected guest. A young American backpacker. A fun-loving human. Monsters, hide your daughters.3.5 out of 5 stars. It seems odd to be praising Adam Sandler for turning in a (relatively) restrained performance when that performance happens to be in his role of Count Dracula. HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA certainly is an enjoyable enough picture. It presents sharp and stylized animation, thanks to Genndy Tartakovsky's vision. Tartakovsky, if you recall, is the mastermind behind fun 'toons like DEXTER'S LABORATORY, POWERPUFF GIRLS, SAMURAI JACK, and the hand-drawn Star Wars microseries, CLONE WARS (not the CGI version). I do recommend HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA but with a reservation or three.Them kids will love it, love the frenetic pace and the Looney Tunes vibe and the sometimes potty humor. I enjoy those as well, but I can't help it if I occasionally want something more than what's tailored for kid-oriented sensibilities. I can't help but wonder what Pixar - a studio that seamlessly balances fantastic humor and heartfelt storytelling - would've done with this. The storyline unfolds in by-the-numbers fashion. It invests so much in overcaffeinated sight gags that it sacrifices all genuine emotions. To me, those father-daughter moments between Drac and Mavis that were meant to be moving come off as so much lip service. It doesn't help that the human (Adam Sandberg) is this doltish drifter with mortifying hygiene. As a homebody and a regular bather, I am unable to identify with him. I don't even like backpacks.Despite all that, there's stuff to like. The film exudes such a good-natured vibe. If you like the zany, the gags do come a mile a minute, with enough of 'em hits to compensate for the misses. One of my favorites is a gag involving the Invisible Man playing Charades. I love the character designs. I like Sandler's laid-back take on Dracula, even if, somewhere, Bela Lugosi is rolling in his grave (although this probably just means the sun's almost set). Most of all, as a fan of those old-timey, black-and-white Universal creature features, I appreciate the homage intended by Tartakovsky, Sandler, and company. And I like the conceit of Count Dracula's trying his hand at entrepreneurship. I guess it's just one more way for him to bleed people dry.The DVd's bonus stuff:- Filmmakers' Commentary with director Genndy Tartakovsky, producer Michelle Murdocca, and visual effects supervisor Daniel Kramer- ""Goodnight Mr. Foot"" Animated Short Film (00:04:07 minutes)- 3 Deleted Scenes, two of which are in rough draft animation (totaling 00:06:24 minutes)- ""Problem (Monster Remix)"" Music Video by Becky G featuring Will.I.Am- Behind the Scenes of the ""Problem"" Music Video which mostly has Will.I.Am talking about his collaboration with Becky G (00:02:22 minutes)",4,"""I do not say 'Bleh bleh-bleh'.""",1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,3941,"['bit', 'swerve', 'monsters', 'who', 'fear', 'humans', 'fear', 'mob', 'mentality', 'pitchforks', 'torches', 'Hidden', 'human', 'world', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'last', 'sanctuary', 'monsters', 'haven', 'human', 'persecution', 'proprietor', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'hotel', 'been', 'human-free', '1898', 'moment', 'monster', 'kids', 'theater', 'watching', 'film', 'probably', 'felt', 'twinge', 'unease', 'Duhn-DUHN', '-duhn.Dracula', 'daughter', 'whom', 'overprotective', 'celebrate', 'daughter', 'Mavis', '118th', 'birthday', 'bash', 'horror', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Drac', 'one', 'party', 'hosts', 'just', 'want', 'smack', 'head', 'what', 'rigidly', 'structured', 'planning', 'epic', 'lameness', 'party', 'activities', 'more', 'personal', 'note', 'denying', 'Mavis', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'freedom', 'so', 'curious', 'humans', 'travel', 'world', 'experience', 'exotic', 'cultures', 'mingle', 'different', 'folks', 'warning', 'how', 'so', 'very', 'dangerous', 'humans', 'are', 'Who', 'how', 'long', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'remained', 'status', 'quo', 'then', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'unexpected', 'guest', 'young', 'American', 'backpacker', 'fun-loving', 'human', 'Monsters', 'hide', 'daughters.3.5', '5', 'stars', 'odd', 'be', 'praising', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'turning', 'relatively', 'restrained', 'performance', 'when', 'performance', 'be', 'role', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'HOTEL', 'TRANSYLVANIA', 'certainly', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'picture', 'sharp', 'stylized', 'animation', 'thanks', 'Genndy', 'Tartakovsky', 'vision', 'Tartakovsky', 'recall', 'mastermind', 'fun', ""'toons"", 'DEXTER', 'LABORATORY', 'POWERPUFF', 'GIRLS', 'SAMURAI', 'JACK', 'hand-drawn', 'Star', 'Wars', 'microseries', 'CLONE', 'WARS', 'not', 'CGI', 'version', 'do', 'recommend', 'HOTEL', 'TRANSYLVANIA', 'reservation', 'three.Them', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'love', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'vibe', 'sometimes', 'potty', 'humor', 'enjoy', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'occasionally', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'what', 'tailored', 'kid-oriented', 'sensibilities', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'Pixar', 'studio', 'seamlessly', 'fantastic', 'humor', 'heartfelt', 'storytelling', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'storyline', 'by-the-numbers', 'fashion', 'so', 'much', 'overcaffeinated', 'sight', 'gags', 'genuine', 'emotions', 'father-daughter', 'moments', 'Drac', 'Mavis', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'moving', 'come', 'off', 'so', 'much', 'lip', 'service', ""n't"", 'help', 'human', 'Adam', 'Sandberg', 'doltish', 'drifter', 'mortifying', 'hygiene', 'homebody', 'regular', 'bather', 'am', 'unable', 'identify', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'backpacks.Despite', 'stuff', 'like', 'film', 'exudes', 'such', 'good-natured', 'vibe', 'like', 'zany', 'gags', 'do', 'come', 'mile', 'minute', 'enough', 'hits', 'compensate', 'misses', 'One', 'favorites', 'gag', 'involving', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'playing', 'Charades', 'love', 'character', 'designs', 'like', 'Sandler', 'laid-back', 'take', 'Dracula', 'even', 'somewhere', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'rolling', 'grave', 'probably', 'just', 'sun', 'almost', 'set', 'Most', 'fan', 'old-timey', 'black-and-white', 'Universal', 'creature', 'features', 'appreciate', 'homage', 'intended', 'Tartakovsky', 'Sandler', 'company', 'like', 'conceit', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'trying', 'hand', 'entrepreneurship', 'guess', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'way', 'bleed', 'people', 'dry.The', 'DVd', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Filmmakers', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Genndy', 'Tartakovsky', 'producer', 'Michelle', 'Murdocca', 'visual', 'effects', 'supervisor', 'Daniel', 'Kramer-', 'Goodnight', 'Mr', 'Foot', 'Animated', 'Short', 'Film', '00:04:07', 'minutes', '3', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'two', 'are', 'rough', 'draft', 'animation', 'totaling', '00:06:24', 'minutes', 'Problem', 'Monster', 'Remix', 'Music', 'Video', 'Becky', 'G', 'featuring', 'Will.I.Am-', 'Scenes', 'Problem', 'Music', 'Video', 'mostly', 'Will.I.Am', 'talking', 'collaboration', 'Becky', 'G', '00:02:22', 'minutes']",N/A

P.,"[2, 4]","Hotel Transylvania could well have been a humorous but thought provoking exercise in prejudice and fear but the message is diluted with obnoxiously-stupid male protagonist and the frequent bouts with bathroom humor.The idea itself is original.  Count Dracula has built a hotel in Transylvania to house monsters that would not be allowed to survive in a human world.  Yes, the monsters are just as scared of the humans as the humans are of the monsters.  Which brings forth two different plots: Dracula's coming of age daughter wants to leave home and explore the world, but through a ploy by a fearful and overprotective father is scared into staying home; and the hotel is visited by a young collegiate who is traveling alone, with whom Dracula's daughter falls in love, to the dismay of the father,This is indeed a solid plot except that while Dracula's daughter seems energetic and articulate, the young male collegiate traveler talks like an imbecile and seems to have an IQ lower than your average head of cabbage.  This, I found irritating.  I wondered not only how a smart woman such as Dracula's daughter could fall for such an idiot, but also why modern comedy is forced to rely on stupid men, flatulence, and a male groin kick, particularly in a movie targeted toward children, suggesting that perhaps poking fun at anything else would be deemed politically incorrect and therefore offensive.This is particularly sad considering the potential this movie had to not only entertain but to convey a wholesome message as well.

The issue of acceptance of somebody just because is different it is also explained a human in a place of monsters, the issues with change and adaptation to new circumstances things that some adults will understand and appreciate and our kids will need to learn and assimilate. The animation is magnificent and my 5 years old found some parts hilarious (Frankenstein cannonball at the pool and further ""disintegration"").  There are some side jokes for adults that fortunately young kids most likely would not get. There are some characters that are simply hilarious such as Frankenstein, his wife, the couple of skeletons, the mummy, the werewolf, etc.Like all this kind of movies the issues of love, parent's guidance, friendship, having fun and acceptance, change are masterfully displayed in my opinion.

1322582,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B0034G4OYA,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 1]","***This review may contain spoilers***In case you weren&#8217;t a Saturday-morning cartoon show freak during the &#8216;70s, the &#8220;Groovie Ghoulies&#8221; was a Hal Sutherland/Filmation animated production featuring nice, family friendly versions of Dracula, the Frankenstein Monster, and the Wolfman (Drac, Frankie, and Wolfie respectively) plus a few other legendary monsters.  The cartoons spotlighted their wacky, episodic adventures in a castle called Horrible Hall and also in the &#8220;real&#8221; world &#8211; or at least the world of Archie, Veronica, Betty, Reggie, and Jughead.  They also did &#8220;Laugh-In&#8221; jokes and skits.Hotel Transylvania&#8221; (hereafter &#8220;H-Trans&#8221;) borrows a fair amount of that 60ish, freestyle &#8220;Groovie Ghoulies&#8221; vibe (plus the vibes of movies like &#8220;The Croods&#8221;, &#8220;Monsters vs. Aliens&#8221;, and even the Harry Potter series, and of course TV series like &#8220;The Addams Family&#8221; and &#8220;The Munsters&#8221;).  But that&#8217;s good, because &#8220;H-Trans&#8221; uses its borrowings skillfully to spin out a wildly enjoyable, supersonic story about an extended nuclear monster family.The main theme revolves around widower Count Dracula&#8217;s (Adam Sandler ) frantic efforts to safeguard his only child, surprisingly fetching  and independent-willed vampire daughter named Mavis (Selena Gomez) from the ignorant terrors of the human world.  Having reached the age of monster maturity (118, or 18 in human years), Mavis is eager to explore the mysterious world beyond the creepy, eerie walls of Dracula&#8217;s castle.  However, Dracula goes to extravagant lengths, even fabricating a Balkan village populated by the undead pretending to be hostile humans, to keep Mavis safe at home.  Beyond that, Dracula has renovated his castle to be a hotel/retreat/refuge for all sorts of kooky, &#8220;domesticated&#8221; monsters, from good-natured husband Frank (Kevin James) and his nagging wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), to harried wolfman Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and his pregnant wife Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their unruly canine brood, to the narcissistic, bespectacled Invisible Man (David Spade), to obese but hip and swaggering mummy Murray (CeeLo Green), plus practically every other monster in creation.To keep the meddling humans out, Dracula has converted the hotel/castle into a seemingly impenetrable, booby-trapped fortress.  Nevertheless, a back-packing surfer dude type named Jonathan (Andy Samburg) stumbles into the castle and is somewhat terrified by but far more curious about the place and its odd denizens.  Aghast, Dracula tries EVERYTHING he can to either hide the human Jonathan from his suspicious guests, especially Mavis, or to disguise him as Frank&#8217;s &#8220;right-hand&#8221; cousin &#8220;Johnnystein&#8221;, who is also a &#8220;party planner&#8221;.  Of course, this fails and Jonathan and Mavis meet and find a &#8220;zing&#8221; of love and affection exists between them, so much so that in a calm, sweet break from the action, they climb to the hotel roof and Jonathan shows Mavis her first sunrise from beneath the shade of a chimney, since of course vampires and sunlight are not friends.Eventually even the obstinate Count and his guests realize that Jonathan is a pretty decent, trustworthy fellow, especially for a human, and knows how to liven up a bunch of cool, party-hearty but somewhat out-of-touch, antiquated monsters.  Dracula even confesses to Jonathan in an emotional sequence how a bunch of torch-and-pitchfork villagers killed his wife and embittered him against humanity. Jonathan and Mavis get closer and even kiss (which bugs Dracula so much his face turns red and his fangs grow, which always cracked me up) and may even start on a path of wedded independence.But chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz), instead of his expected gentle personality, reveals a nasty but funny desire to serve Jonathan for dinner.  Naturally, this drives Jonathan away from the castle.  Formerly biased and cautious Dracula (and company) must now brave the outside human world AND daylight to intercept Jonathan&#8217;s airplane flight from Transylvania and convince him to return.  Can he do it, and reunite him with Mavis?As I said, &#8220;H-Trans&#8221; is a supersonic, roller-coaster delight of a &#8220;monster&#8221; movie that will almost give you a whiplash.  Despite the pace, however, the movie is a clever, respectful homage AND parody of famous monsters (even the &#8220;Twilight&#8221; vampires) which also obtains its laughs from common domestic themes such as parent-child interactions, the search for autonomy and freedom, the need to let someone you love go and find his/her destiny, and the unexpected power of forgiveness.  &#8220;H-Trans&#8221; also displays its humor through sharp dialogue and one-liners, slapstick pratfalls, and juvenile humor.  In other words, just about anyone, from ADD patients to reasonably sophisticated cinema lovers, can find something to like about &#8220;H-Trans&#8221;.These characters, monster and human, lead interesting lives, and deserve a sequel! &#61514;",5,"The &#8220;Groovie Ghoulies&#8221; On Speed &#8211; You Don&#8217;t Just Watch &#8220;Hotel Transylvania&#8221;, You Ride It!",1402012800,"06 6,

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[2, 3]","My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this (2 adults, an 8-year old, and 2 six-year olds) - it was our favorite of recent kid's movies. Adam Sandler stars as the voice of Count Dracula, widowed father to a daughter, Mavis, voiced by Selana Gomez. To protect her from humans - who he blames for his wife's death - he builds a hotel for monsters, where no humans are allowed. Frankenstein, Big Foot, mummies, werewolves, the Invisible Man and many more are all regular visitors and converge for Mavis's 118th birthday - clearly the equivalent of a human's 18th. Mavis is bored and would prefer to explore the human world - something her father does not want her doing. Things are thrown into chaos when a young hip human backpacker somehow wanders in, and he and Mavis fall for each other.This movie is thoroughly entertaining, with many funny moments for kids and adults. The monsters are more comedic than scary, and most of the humor is warm-hearted, not mean-spirited like so many films are (even family films.) The plot ultimately revolves around the father daughter relationship between the Count and Mavis, and his having to accept her growing up, and in that sense it's downright sweet. A nice break from superhero battles. And this movie appeals to both genders - my daughters and son both enjoyed it equally.

1322642,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B0034G4OYA,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[31, 46]","What a fun and heartfelt film Hotel Transylvania was when I recently attended a screening whereby producer Michelle Murdocca (Open Season 2, Stuart Little) explained, ""Executive producer and star, Adam Sandler did an amazing job joining this production late in its original inception. It took some 10 years to get this project in theatres,"" who herself was on the project from the beginning.Russian born director Genndy Tartakovsky (Star Wars: The Clone Wars) says, ""It was a fun an amazing challenge to get this going and it was a real different environment working with a larger studio."" His attention to the details made this film work from page to screen.The story centers around a place where all monsters can go to be themselves. Naturally walking around, celebrating anniversaries, eating as they do, sleeping the way they do, even swimming in pools and enjoying a night of fun and partying. The place (a really creepy castle) was built by Dracula himself (voiced amazingly well by Adam Sandler (Click, Bedtime Stories)) and because of an early accident due to the fear that monsters have toward humans, a tragic accident leaves him to be a single father. Raising and `protecting' his daughter from the outside world.Mavis, his daughter, who is sharply voiced by Selena Gomez (The Wizards of Waverly Place, Another Cinderella Story) reaches her 118th birthday and decides she needs to see the world because of the sheltered life her father has created for her. Due to a series of mishaps and bad turn of events a `lie' goes very wrong and she soon realizes what she has been hidden from.In steps a real human, quite by accident, Jonathan, played by Andy Samberg (SNL, That's My Boy), wanders his way into the hotel. Yet another lie, Dracula tries to cover his true human self and pass Jonathan off as a `real' monster. Another thing that Dracula didn't see coming was the moment that Mavis and Jonathan meet and their eyes connect, you guessed it, the real magic of the heart happens.The screenplay by Peter Baynham (Borat, Bruno) and Robert Smigel (SNL, You Don't Mess With The Zohan) does something that most live-action screenplays try to achieve but never do,  it mixes some great fast paced visual gags with a real heart and real believable story. This movie is about a father and daughter relationship as well as misconceptions we all carry with us based on really never checking things out for ourselves.This film has a great line-up of really hysterical characters including; Frankenstein voiced by Kevin James (King of Queens, Hitch); Mrs. Frankenstein Wanda voiced by Molly Shannon (Superstar, Analyze This); The Wolfman Wayne voiced by Steve Buscemi (Boardwalk Empire, Grown-Ups) and his wife Eunice voiced by Fran Drescher (The Nanny, Beautician and the Beast); The Mummy Murray voiced by CeeLo Green (Kung Fu Panda, Kick Ass) and playing the hunchback Quasimodo is the voice of Jon Lovitz (Big, A League of Their Own).Great for the Halloween theme and in full 3-D, this film was amazingly funny, and full of great classic-style sight gags that you'll probably need to see it more than once to catch them all. ""I took a lot of time to make sure this film worked on all levels. From the script to the performances and even the technology in making it,"" says the director Genndy . And you can really see it on screen!What makes this animated feature by Columbia Pictures so good, is that it has a very big heart and an extremely relatable story to go with it.

The animation is wonderful. The cinematography is exquisite. The voices for the characters are flawless.

This movie depicts a form of Love, that shows and teaches kids and others that Love does come from the heart, and when you know it, you just do.2. Shows the struggle of relationships, that they can get tangled and twisted, but never broken, even when a loved on has moved on Life, they will always be there to help guide you.. you just have to open up your eyes and accept it, even if it was something you were hiding from and trying to prevent.3. Shows parents that kids do fall, stumble, in life, such is Life, but when they find someone else they can trust and love, than that should be something to admire and appreciate and have the child learn many things from.4. Life is amazing! This journey we call Life really is spectacularly complex and different, so there will never be an instruction manual (even though sometimes I wish there were when I have had to make life decision) but the whole beauty of life is that it is a beautiful struggle, and with it comes progress and strength, and down the road...

Clampett was one of the men responsible for the classic Warner Brothers cartoons and helped create Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and later Beanie and Cecil. One thing he said always stuck with me. He said that during the censorship days of the Hayes Committee, the animators/writers would always sneak in jokes that would pass that adults would get and that children wouldn't understand. This made those cartoons something that adults as well as children could enjoy then. While not every animator these days follows that advice those behind HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA do and the result is a great movie that entertains children AND adults.One hundred and eighteen years ago Count Dracula built a castle/hotel where monsters would find safe haven from the humans that hunted and tried to destroy them. Each year the monsters all gather to celebrate the birthday of Dracula's daughter Mavis. This year will be different though as Mavis' special gift is one left by her mother who died when she was born, to be opened on this particular birthday. Keep in mind 118 in Dracula years makes her in her late teens.Mavis longs to leave the castle and roam the world to see what is out there. Inspired by a post card she found in her mother's belongings of Hawaii, she wants to see what her mother saw, to experience something behind the walls she's known all her life. Her father, knowing that humans would rather see her dead, wants her to say home though and will do everything in his power to insure she does so. He even goes so far as to allow her to visit a local village, not telling her something she'll only discover later about that village.Mavis returns home and all seems to be going well until a stranger shows up. Jonathan is a backpacking teen on vacation roaming the countryside who accidentally stumbles upon the well hidden castle. He enters and finds everything he sees amazing until Dracula finds him. Trying to prevent him from being destroyed by the monsters (who think that all humans want to destroy them), Dracula puts Jonathan in make up and has him pose as a party planner there to help with Mavis birthday bash. When Mavis gets a glimpse of Jonathan, the first person she's ever seen close to her age, they both get a glazed look in their eyes and suffer a case of love at first sight.But human and vampire have no chance for happiness in the eyes of good old dad, so he tries to keep the two apart. Dracula's parties have long since lost their luster and are boring even to the yearly attendees who include Frankenstein, the Mummy, Wolfman, Invisible Man and more. Jonathan livens this up with his youthful ways much to the chagrin of Dracula. Can the star crossed lovers make a go of it? Or will Dracula make sure that the Jonathan stays safe from the rest of the monsters who actually seem to like him almost better than Dracula?It's a simple plot to begin with and ends up offering plenty of items that will inspire tons of laughter from young and old. The old versus new isn't played out to make one seem better than the other, just different. Dracula is not as bad as one would think watching this movie and his concern for his daughter and her happiness is the center piece to the film. The love between the two is one that should be a good point for families once you get past the whole vampire thing.The visual gags here fill the film from start to finish. It's one of those movies that you'll probably want to watch more than once just to catch the jokes you missed the first time. The writing is well done and offers just as many jokes as the visuals.The animation here is fantastic. It still amazes me to see individual hairs on something like Dracula or Mavis in bat form. The detail is crisp and clear and to think that technology has come this far is astounding. The voice work is done incredibly well with cast members like Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Selena Gomez, Fran Drescher and Steve Buscemi.HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is a movie that the entire family can enjoy together. It offers plenty of laughs and a touching story of father and daughter. It also offers a great launch pad for parents who would like their kids to know what the classic monsters were like. Who knows, maybe it will even inspire some to get their kids to watch those classic Karloff and Lugosi films.",5,FEARSOME FUN,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,4374,"['was', 'fortunate', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'Bob', 'Clampett', 'speak', 'years', 'ago', 'Clampett', 'was', 'one', 'men', 'responsible', 'classic', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'cartoons', 'helped', 'create', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'Daffy', 'Duck', 'later', 'Beanie', 'Cecil', 'One', 'thing', 'said', 'always', 'stuck', 'said', 'censorship', 'days', 'Hayes', 'Committee', 'animators/writers', 'would', 'always', 'sneak', 'jokes', 'would', 'pass', 'adults', 'would', 'get', 'children', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'made', 'cartoons', 'something', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'could', 'enjoy', 'then', 'not', 'animator', 'days', 'advice', 'HOTEL', 'TRANSYLVANIA', 'do', 'result', 'great', 'movie', 'children', 'adults.One', 'hundred', 'eighteen', 'years', 'ago', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'built', 'castle/hotel', 'where', 'monsters', 'would', 'find', 'safe', 'haven', 'humans', 'hunted', 'tried', 'destroy', 'year', 'monsters', 'gather', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'Dracula', 'daughter', 'Mavis', 'year', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'Mavis', 'special', 'gift', 'one', 'left', 'mother', 'who', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'born', 'be', 'opened', 'particular', 'birthday', 'Keep', 'mind', '118', 'Dracula', 'years', 'late', 'teens.Mavis', 'longs', 'leave', 'castle', 'roam', 'world', 'see', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'Inspired', 'post', 'card', 'found', 'mother', 'belongings', 'Hawaii', 'see', 'what', 'mother', 'saw', 'experience', 'something', 'walls', 'known', 'life', 'father', 'knowing', 'humans', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'dead', 'say', 'home', 'will', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'insure', 'so', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'allow', 'visit', 'local', 'village', 'not', 'telling', 'something', ""'ll"", 'only', 'discover', 'later', 'village.Mavis', 'home', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'stranger', 'up', 'Jonathan', 'backpacking', 'teen', 'vacation', 'roaming', 'countryside', 'who', 'accidentally', 'well', 'hidden', 'castle', 'everything', 'amazing', 'Dracula', 'Trying', 'prevent', 'being', 'destroyed', 'monsters', 'who', 'think', 'humans', 'want', 'destroy', 'Dracula', 'Jonathan', 'make', 'up', 'pose', 'party', 'planner', 'there', 'help', 'Mavis', 'birthday', 'bash', 'When', 'Mavis', 'glimpse', 'Jonathan', 'first', 'person', 'ever', 'seen', 'close', 'age', 'get', 'glazed', 'look', 'eyes', 'suffer', 'case', 'love', 'first', 'sight.But', 'human', 'vampire', 'have', 'chance', 'happiness', 'eyes', 'good', 'old', 'dad', 'keep', 'two', 'apart', 'Dracula', 'parties', 'have', 'long', 'lost', 'luster', 'are', 'boring', 'even', 'yearly', 'attendees', 'who', 'include', 'Frankenstein', 'Mummy', 'Wolfman', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'more', 'Jonathan', 'up', 'youthful', 'ways', 'much', 'chagrin', 'Dracula', 'Can', 'star', 'crossed', 'lovers', 'make', 'go', 'will', 'Dracula', 'make', 'sure', 'Jonathan', 'safe', 'rest', 'monsters', 'who', 'actually', 'seem', 'like', 'almost', 'better', 'Dracula', 'simple', 'plot', 'begin', 'up', 'offering', 'plenty', 'items', 'will', 'inspire', 'tons', 'laughter', 'young', 'old', 'old', 'versus', 'new', ""n't"", 'played', 'out', 'make', 'one', 'seem', 'better', 'other', 'just', 'different', 'Dracula', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'watching', 'movie', 'concern', 'daughter', 'happiness', 'center', 'piece', 'film', 'love', 'two', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'point', 'families', 'once', 'get', 'whole', 'vampire', 'thing.The', 'visual', 'gags', 'here', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'one', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'just', 'catch', 'jokes', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'writing', 'well', 'done', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'jokes', 'visuals.The', 'animation', 'here', 'fantastic', 'still', 'see', 'individual', 'hairs', 'something', 'Dracula', 'Mavis', 'bat', 'form', 'detail', 'crisp', 'clear', 'think', 'technology', 'come', 'far', 'astounding', 'voice', 'work', 'done', 'incredibly', 'well', 'cast', 'members', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'Steve', 'Buscemi.HOTEL', 'TRANSYLVANIA', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'touching', 'story', 'father', 'daughter', 'also', 'great', 'launch', 'pad', 'parents', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'kids', 'know', 'what', 'classic', 'monsters', 'were', 'like', 'Who', 'maybe', 'will', 'even', 'inspire', 'get', 'kids', 'watch', 'classic', 'Karloff', 'Lugosi', 'films']",N/A

1322668,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0034G4OYA,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 9]","'Hotel Transylvania': More Monster High than Monster MashI'm a big fan of Genndy Tartakovsky's work on ""Samurai Jack,"" ""Sym-Bionic Titan,"" and the unsurpassed ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"" shorts, so I was eager to see how he would fare as a director of a computer-animated film. As it turns out, his monsters have more bark than bite.The problem with ""Hotel Transylvania"" isn't the animation (which is solid), the voice acting (which is amusing), or even the characters (which dutifully recall the monsters of yesteryear).  It's the entire premise for a family film: (one-hundred and-) 18-year-old daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) wants to see the world but her father Dracula (Adam Sandler) is terrified of humanity after his wife was killed by an angry human mob.  Humans in this world are the real monsters - you know, like ""Monsters, Inc."" only with more traditional critters from horror movie canon.In honor of Mavis' upcoming birthday, all the family friends have been invited: Frankenstein's Monster (Kevin James) and his bride (Fran Drescher); a chubby mummy that's obviously based on the oft auto-tuned voice of Cee Lo Green; harried werewolf parents Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and Wanda (Molly Shanon); Griffin the invisible man (David Spade); and a litany of blink-and-you'll-miss it monster cameos. Drac decides to manipulate his daughter into staying at the hotel by terrifying her with an elaborate deception.  Then clueless traveling human hipster Johnny (Adam Sandberg) stumbles into the castle and suddenly Mavis' world is upended by evidence that humanity may not be that bad after all.The plot bumps along unevenly. Never mind that nearly every single main character was arguably human at one point - Frankenstein's Monster is made of humans (a running joke to explain how Johnny, disguised as another Monster, is distantly related), Dracula was human, the werewolves are presumably human some of the time, Griffin is still human, the mummy was...you get the idea.  Quasimodo is the chief antagonist (Jon Lovitz), but last I checked he was human too.The plot pivots on the ""zing"" - love at first sight, basically - but that concept is introduced before the big reveal of a gift from Mavis' mother that only reinforces what we knew all along about ""zinging."" The idea that my little girl might fall in love with the first man she meets also rubs me the wrong way...Mavis can't just explore the world on her own, she has to fall in love with a man (sparing her father the horror of dating!) so she transitions from protective father figure to protective boyfriend.There's evidence of severe rewrites all over this script - since it's been in development since 2006 perhaps this is not surprising. It all culminates in a series of reveals and betrayals, which are resolved by our protagonists going on a road trip to reunite the two wayward souls.  Or at least it seems that way, until you realize that none of the supporting characters actually do anything at all.""Hotel Transylvania"" regularly flirts with the difficult realities of monsters - at one point, Drac says, ""I can't kill him, it would set monsters back hundreds of years."" But this is a PG flick, so even the notion of vampirism isn't considered, which is a shame.  It's probably the only way Mavis and Johnny will ever truly be together.Despite my qualms about the plot, this is a light-hearted love note to fans of monster movies and...their daughters. ""Hotel Transylvania"" hopes you fondly recall the horror movies of the past but not too much lest you remember that even vampires have to eat.  It's basically a paranormal romance disguised as a kid's movie.",3,More Monster High than Monster Mash,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,3628,"[""'Hotel"", 'Transylvania', 'More', 'Monster', 'High', 'Monster', 'MashI', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Genndy', 'Tartakovsky', 'work', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'Sym-Bionic', 'Titan', 'unsurpassed', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'shorts', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'fare', 'director', 'computer-animated', 'film', 'out', 'monsters', 'have', 'more', 'bark', 'bite.The', 'problem', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', ""n't"", 'animation', 'solid', 'voice', 'acting', 'amusing', 'even', 'characters', 'dutifully', 'recall', 'monsters', 'yesteryear', 'entire', 'premise', 'family', 'film', 'one-hundred', 'and-', '18-year-old', 'daughter', 'Mavis', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'see', 'world', 'father', 'Dracula', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'terrified', 'humanity', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'angry', 'human', 'mob', 'Humans', 'world', 'are', 'real', 'monsters', 'know', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'only', 'more', 'traditional', 'critters', 'horror', 'movie', 'canon.In', 'honor', 'Mavis', 'upcoming', 'birthday', 'family', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'invited', 'Frankenstein', 'Monster', 'Kevin', 'James', 'bride', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'chubby', 'mummy', 'obviously', 'based', 'oft', 'auto-tuned', 'voice', 'Cee', 'Lo', 'Green', 'harried', 'werewolf', 'parents', 'Wayne', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Wanda', 'Molly', 'Shanon', 'Griffin', 'invisible', 'man', 'David', 'Spade', 'litany', ""blink-and-you'll-miss"", 'monster', 'cameos', 'Drac', 'manipulate', 'daughter', 'staying', 'hotel', 'terrifying', 'elaborate', 'deception', 'Then', 'clueless', 'traveling', 'human', 'hipster', 'Johnny', 'Adam', 'Sandberg', 'castle', 'suddenly', 'Mavis', 'world', 'upended', 'evidence', 'humanity', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'all.The', 'plot', 'bumps', 'unevenly', 'Never', 'mind', 'nearly', 'single', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'arguably', 'human', 'one', 'point', 'Frankenstein', 'Monster', 'made', 'humans', 'running', 'joke', 'explain', 'how', 'Johnny', 'disguised', 'Monster', 'distantly', 'related', 'Dracula', 'was', 'human', 'werewolves', 'are', 'presumably', 'human', 'time', 'Griffin', 'still', 'human', 'mummy', 'was', 'get', 'idea', 'Quasimodo', 'chief', 'antagonist', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'last', 'checked', 'was', 'human', 'too.The', 'plot', 'pivots', 'zing', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'basically', 'concept', 'introduced', 'big', 'reveal', 'gift', 'Mavis', 'mother', 'only', 'what', 'knew', 'zinging', 'idea', 'little', 'girl', 'might', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'man', 'also', 'rubs', 'wrong', 'way', 'Mavis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'explore', 'world', 'own', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'sparing', 'father', 'horror', 'dating', 'transitions', 'protective', 'father', 'figure', 'protective', 'evidence', 'severe', 'rewrites', 'script', 'been', 'development', '2006', 'perhaps', 'not', 'surprising', 'culminates', 'series', 'reveals', 'betrayals', 'are', 'resolved', 'protagonists', 'going', 'road', 'trip', 'reunite', 'two', 'wayward', 'souls', 'least', 'way', 'realize', 'none', 'supporting', 'characters', 'actually', 'do', 'anything', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'regularly', 'difficult', 'realities', 'monsters', 'one', 'point', 'Drac', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kill', 'would', 'set', 'monsters', 'back', 'hundreds', 'years', 'PG', 'flick', 'so', 'even', 'notion', 'vampirism', ""n't"", 'considered', 'shame', 'probably', 'only', 'way', 'Mavis', 'Johnny', 'will', 'ever', 'truly', 'be', 'together.Despite', 'qualms', 'plot', 'light-hearted', 'love', 'note', 'fans', 'monster', 'movies', 'daughters', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'fondly', 'recall', 'horror', 'movies', 'past', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'lest', 'remember', 'even', 'vampires', 'have', 'eat', 'basically', 'paranormal', 'romance', 'disguised', 'kid', 'movie']",N/A

1322716,AHF97M45JFCB,B0034G4OYA,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","This past Halloween was pretty exciting as far as animated features goes: Frankenweenie, Paranorman, Hotel Transylvania- if a trip to my local Cineplex didn't cost roughly the same as the Gross National Product of Latvia; I imagine there could have been some seriously great memories made with a tub of popcorn and a warm hoodie.  But alas, I digress.  In my case, Hotel Transylvania had to wait for the home release and for the most part, it was quite enjoyable if entirely inappropriate seasonally.Hotel Transylvania is the $85-million dollar, 91-minute PG rated animated film rumored to have been in development for an abnormally long (even for an animated feature) six-years. The end result lavishly uses the CG medium to reflect the direction and style of animator/director Genndy Tartakovsky.  If that means nothing to you, imagine a slightly caricaturized version of the classic movie monsters complete with clich&eacute;s and accents a plenty.While Sony's Image Works division rarely threatens Pixar or DreamWork's supremacy in the computer animated realm, the visuals are solid here with a good deal of background detail present that almost demands multiple viewings so fully absorb.The story, while certainly adequate, sadly never reaches much deeper than the previews alluded: In 1895, Count Dracula builds a resort in Transylvania, hidden away from the humanity, as a place for monsters to crash but also as a sanctuary to raise his daughter Mavis.Fast forward to present day and old Drac is busy inviting friends (among these Frankenstein and his wife Eunice; Wayne and Wanda werewolves; Griffin, the invisible man; Murray, the mummy; Bigfoot, among others) to the hotel so as to celebrate the 118th birthday of Mavis (18 in human years).Just as the party is about to get underway, a dopey 21-year-old human named Jonathan happens to stumble upon the hotel.  Monsters, it turns out, fear humans the way, well, the way humans fear monsters.  Ordinarily the Count would likely kick a wandering human to the curb (possibly short on a few corpuscles) but complicating matters is Mavis, who falls in love with the lad quite unaware that he is in fact a human.Undoubtedly the film's greatest strength lies in its casting: Adam Sandler as Dracula, Andy Samberg as Jonathan, Kevin James as Frankenstein, David Spade as the Invisible Man, Steve Buscemi as Wolfman and on and on.  One really gets the feeling that these guys could be reading random pages from a phonebook and elicit the giggles.  That said, everyone plays really well off each other but never reach the type of comedic crescendo I sort of expected going in.  Most of the humor is actually derived from visual gags (Frankenstein's lower half releases some gas that gets blames on the unsuspecting Mummy, a female skeleton gets caught showering and tries to cover up despite having no physical features to hide and so on).Mark Mothersbaugh's upbeat score is quite appropriate; reminding the viewer in even the darkest moments of the piece that the focal point here is laughter and silliness with love as the backdrop.  The ending of the film does break out into a cheesy musical number that some may find a bit much but in all the audio is right up there with the visuals in terms of propelling the prose along.In all Hotel Transylvania is a success on most every level.  It lacks that Pixar creativity factor that continually results in the studio's showering in awards but it's solid through and through with visual charm that will keep the young ones entertained and enough layered wit for adults to enjoy as well.",4,A Monstrously Enjoyable Romp,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,3585,"['past', 'Halloween', 'was', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'as', 'far', 'animated', 'features', 'Frankenweenie', 'Paranorman', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania-', 'trip', 'local', 'Cineplex', 'did', ""n't"", 'cost', 'roughly', 'same', 'Gross', 'National', 'Product', 'Latvia', 'imagine', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'seriously', 'great', 'memories', 'made', 'tub', 'popcorn', 'warm', 'hoodie', 'alas', 'digress', 'case', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'had', 'wait', 'home', 'release', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'entirely', 'inappropriate', 'seasonally.Hotel', 'Transylvania', '85-million', 'dollar', '91-minute', 'PG', 'rated', 'animated', 'film', 'rumored', 'have', 'been', 'development', 'abnormally', 'long', 'even', 'animated', 'feature', 'six-years', 'end', 'result', 'lavishly', 'CG', 'medium', 'reflect', 'direction', 'style', 'animator/director', 'Genndy', 'Tartakovsky', 'nothing', 'imagine', 'slightly', 'caricaturized', 'version', 'classic', 'movie', 'monsters', 'complete', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plenty.While', 'Sony', 'Image', 'Works', 'division', 'rarely', 'Pixar', 'DreamWork', 'supremacy', 'computer', 'animated', 'realm', 'visuals', 'are', 'solid', 'here', 'good', 'deal', 'background', 'detail', 'present', 'almost', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'so', 'fully', 'absorb.The', 'story', 'certainly', 'adequate', 'sadly', 'never', 'much', 'deeper', 'previews', 'alluded', '1895', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'resort', 'Transylvania', 'hidden', 'away', 'humanity', 'place', 'monsters', 'crash', 'also', 'sanctuary', 'raise', 'daughter', 'Mavis.Fast', 'forward', 'present', 'day', 'old', 'Drac', 'busy', 'inviting', 'friends', 'Frankenstein', 'wife', 'Eunice', 'Wayne', 'Wanda', 'werewolves', 'Griffin', 'invisible', 'man', 'Murray', 'mummy', 'Bigfoot', 'others', 'hotel', 'so', 'celebrate', '118th', 'birthday', 'Mavis', '18', 'human', 'years', '.Just', 'party', 'get', 'underway', 'dopey', '21-year-old', 'human', 'named', 'Jonathan', 'stumble', 'hotel', 'Monsters', 'out', 'fear', 'humans', 'way', 'well', 'way', 'humans', 'fear', 'monsters', 'Ordinarily', 'Count', 'would', 'likely', 'kick', 'wandering', 'human', 'curb', 'possibly', 'short', 'few', 'corpuscles', 'complicating', 'matters', 'Mavis', 'who', 'love', 'lad', 'quite', 'unaware', 'fact', 'human.Undoubtedly', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'casting', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Dracula', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'Jonathan', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Frankenstein', 'David', 'Spade', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Wolfman', 'One', 'really', 'feeling', 'guys', 'could', 'be', 'reading', 'random', 'pages', 'phonebook', 'elicit', 'giggles', 'said', 'everyone', 'plays', 'really', 'well', 'other', 'never', 'reach', 'type', 'comedic', 'crescendo', 'sort', 'expected', 'going', 'Most', 'humor', 'actually', 'derived', 'visual', 'gags', 'Frankenstein', 'lower', 'half', 'gas', 'blames', 'unsuspecting', 'Mummy', 'female', 'skeleton', 'caught', 'showering', 'tries', 'cover', 'up', 'having', 'physical', 'features', 'hide', 'so', '.Mark', 'Mothersbaugh', 'upbeat', 'score', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'reminding', 'viewer', 'even', 'darkest', 'moments', 'piece', 'focal', 'point', 'here', 'laughter', 'silliness', 'love', 'backdrop', 'ending', 'film', 'break', 'out', 'cheesy', 'musical', 'number', 'may', 'find', 'bit', 'much', 'audio', 'right', 'there', 'visuals', 'terms', 'propelling', 'prose', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'success', 'most', 'level', 'Pixar', 'creativity', 'factor', 'continually', 'results', 'studio', 'showering', 'awards', 'solid', 'visual', 'charm', 'will', 'keep', 'young', 'ones', 'entertained', 'enough', 'layered', 'wit', 'adults', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well']",N/A

To save his daughter Mavis from suffering a similar fate he commissions a palace to be built. The palace becomes a hidden sanctuary for all the things that go bump in the night.Fast forward to the present, Dracula's daughter is on the verge of her 118th birthday and she is starting to feel cabin fever. Dracula allows her to explore a nearby Romanian town that turns out to be a ruse meant to scare her against humankind. It works and Mavis abandons her quest to see Paradise Hawaii.As famous guests (including the Wolfman, his wife and kids, The Mummy, and The Frankenstein Monster) from all over arrive Dracula is pleased to see everything going smoothly...that is until the human world arrives.Jonathan Van Helsing a 21 year-old backpacker discovers the hidden Castle and thinking that it's a costume party....until he discovers it isn't. To prevent a panic Dracula disguises Jonathan as a monster (a relation of Frankenstein's right arm). A introduces him as a party planner.As Jonathan becomes the ""death"" of the party Dracula begins to lighten up to the human and Mavis begins to fall for him. But when the Hunchback of Notre dame spills the beans as to Jonathan's true nature he leaves claiming he hates monsters, Mavis included.When Dracula discovers that Jonathan was Mavis's ""Zing"" (love at first sight) he as long with the Wolfman, Mummy, Frankenstein Monster and Invisible man leave the safety of the Hotel and venture into Transylvania...which is right in the middle of a Celebration of all things monster.With a large crowd blocking the road and John's plane due to take off the Monster reveals himself in an attempt to scare the crowds away. When the crowd cheers the real monsters, Dracula pleads with the crowd to disperse so he can reunite Mavis n with John.Using a line of Dracula capes to shield from the light, Drac flits to the runway just in time to see that plane take off. Transforming into a Bat Dracula gives Chase and catches up to the plane. He takes control of the pilots mind and apologizes to Jonathan.The movie ends with Mavis and Jonathan a couple ready to leave and explore the world.I was very surprised by this film, the animation was very good as was the acting. However like many others this movie hit upon my pet peeve, of calling the monster Frankenstein. Frankenstein was the name of the Doctor who made it and not the monster itself.

Now its Marvis' 118 birthday and she's ready to meet the outside world head on. What she didn't expect was for the outside world to come to her.  Enter the human party animal John who is always ready for a good time and bring surprises and excitment to Dracula's typically borning birthday party concepts as they fall more and more in love with one another. The catch though is that Dracula worried about what his guests might think of a human showing up in his hidden monster oasis has disguise John as a mini Frankenstein monster.

1322744,A2KYZ55QR70M4K,B0034G4OYA,"Razorline Press ""Razorline Press""","[3, 20]","There's not a lot to like about this movie.  Hotel Transylvania reads like a movie that is supposed to appeal to adults while also entertaining children, but it fails to deliver at its core: jokes.Dracula is the proprietor of a hotel that serves as a getaway for monsters who are tired of beign pursued by mobs of humans.  Funny idea, but it's confusing at the start.  If the monsters are tired of being chased, where are they when they aren't at Hotel Transylvania?  Why didn't Dracula just build a place where they could live forever?  But setting that minor loophole aside, Dracula is supposed to be this misunderstood creature that only wanted to be left alone with his wife and child when a mob took his wife in a fire.  He's only a concerned father now, trying to protect his 100-something years young daughter from the menace that is humanity.  What he winds up being is a completely ball-less 'master' vampire who never bites anyone and is reduced to roaring at people when he gets upset.But it's a children's movie, you say, of course Dracula didn't bite anyone.  That's not my fault.  Sony Pictures chose to make a movie about a monster that couldn't do anything monstrous.  I mean, if Lionsgate chose to make a children's movie starring Leatherface, you'd be a little off-put if he didn't chainsaw anybody, even though you knew it probably wouldn't happen.  So I'm saying a children's movie about classic horror monsters is a mistake in and of itself.But since they insisted, well, what did work?  Adam Sandler's accent?  No, it made him cartoony to the point of silliness (again, I know it was a children's movie, but the accent just didn't work for me).  Jonathan was completely obnoxious throughout as was Mavis.  I was about to go through the list of characters, but it would just annoy me all over again.  I kind of liked Wayne the werewolf and Griffin the invisible man.  I enjoyed the zombies whenever they were on screen.  But I absolutely HATED the shrunken heads.And the jokes themselves seemed put in as an afterthought.  The poorer children's movies have a tell that reveals them as the weak movies they are- senseless violence.  Remember how the minions in Despicable Me would punch each other for no reason and remember how nothing like that ever happened to Toy Story (you should get that I didn't think DM was any good)?  Hotel Transylvania's tell was Dracula roaring at everyone.  It wasn't really funny, they went to it too often, and it didn't make sense why anybody was afraid after he'd done that.What did make me laugh, but struck me as undeservedly funny after I left the theater was near the end when Dracula saw part of a movie that was obviously a dig at Twilight with sparkly, shirtless vampire brooding in a forest.  Dracula makes a comment I can't remember about this being what people think of his kind even though Twilight's vampires actually eat people whereas Dracula doesn't seem to eat anything with a pulse in Hotel Transylvania.  It reminded me of what Roger Ebert said about Fun with Dick and Jane and the movie's lampooning of the failures of Wallstreet.  The movie just didn't deserve to make the joke because it hadn't earned it.I would give this movie 2 out of 5 stars and that's only because my 5 year old enjoyed it.",2,Sucked is Too Strong a Word,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,3271,"['not', 'lot', 'like', 'movie', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'movie', 'supposed', 'appeal', 'adults', 'also', 'entertaining', 'children', 'deliver', 'core', 'jokes.Dracula', 'proprietor', 'hotel', 'getaway', 'monsters', 'who', 'are', 'tired', 'beign', 'pursued', 'mobs', 'humans', 'Funny', 'idea', 'confusing', 'start', 'monsters', 'are', 'tired', 'being', 'chased', 'where', 'are', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Dracula', 'just', 'build', 'place', 'where', 'could', 'live', 'forever', 'setting', 'minor', 'loophole', 'aside', 'Dracula', 'supposed', 'be', 'misunderstood', 'creature', 'only', 'wanted', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'wife', 'child', 'when', 'mob', 'took', 'wife', 'fire', 'only', 'concerned', 'father', 'now', 'trying', 'protect', '100-something', 'years', 'young', 'daughter', 'menace', 'humanity', 'What', 'up', 'being', 'completely', 'ball-less', ""'master"", 'vampire', 'who', 'never', 'anyone', 'reduced', 'roaring', 'people', 'when', 'upset.But', 'children', 'movie', 'say', 'course', 'Dracula', 'did', ""n't"", 'bite', 'anyone', 'not', 'fault', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'chose', 'make', 'movie', 'monster', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'monstrous', 'mean', 'Lionsgate', 'chose', 'make', 'children', 'movie', 'starring', 'Leatherface', ""'d"", 'be', 'little', 'off-put', 'did', ""n't"", 'chainsaw', 'anybody', 'even', 'knew', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', ""'m"", 'saying', 'children', 'movie', 'classic', 'horror', 'monsters', 'mistake', 'itself.But', 'insisted', 'well', 'what', 'did', 'work', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'accent', 'No', 'made', 'cartoony', 'point', 'silliness', 'again', 'know', 'was', 'children', 'movie', 'accent', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Jonathan', 'was', 'completely', 'obnoxious', 'was', 'Mavis', 'was', 'about', 'go', 'list', 'characters', 'would', 'just', 'annoy', 'over', 'again', 'kind', 'liked', 'Wayne', 'werewolf', 'Griffin', 'invisible', 'man', 'enjoyed', 'zombies', 'whenever', 'were', 'screen', 'absolutely', 'HATED', 'shrunken', 'jokes', 'seemed', 'put', 'afterthought', 'poorer', 'children', 'movies', 'have', 'tell', 'weak', 'movies', 'are-', 'senseless', 'violence', 'Remember', 'how', 'minions', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'would', 'punch', 'other', 'reason', 'remember', 'how', 'nothing', 'ever', 'happened', 'Toy', 'Story', 'should', 'get', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'DM', 'was', 'good', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'tell', 'was', 'Dracula', 'roaring', 'everyone', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'funny', 'went', 'too', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'anybody', 'was', 'afraid', ""'d"", 'done', 'did', 'make', 'laugh', 'struck', 'undeservedly', 'funny', 'left', 'theater', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'Dracula', 'saw', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'dig', 'Twilight', 'sparkly', 'shirtless', 'vampire', 'brooding', 'forest', 'Dracula', 'comment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'being', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'kind', 'even', 'Twilight', 'vampires', 'actually', 'eat', 'people', 'whereas', 'Dracula', ""n't"", 'seem', 'eat', 'anything', 'pulse', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'reminded', 'what', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'said', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'movie', 'lampooning', 'failures', 'Wallstreet', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'make', 'joke', 'had', ""n't"", 'earned', 'it.I', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '2', '5', 'stars', 'only', '5', 'year', 'old', 'enjoyed']",N/A

talents of,among others,Adam Sandler as Dracula,Andy Samberg as Jonathan/Johnny/Johnnystein,Selena Gomez as Mavis,Kevin James as Frankenstein/Frank,Fran Drescher as Eunice,Steve Buscemi as Wayne,Molly Shannon as Wanda,David Spade as Griffin the Invisible Man,Cee Lo Green as Murray,and Jon Lovitz as Quasimodo.It's an airing out,in large part for the kiddies,of the Universal monsters,all""dressed"" up(animatedly)to look cutesy.However while the jokes and animation come fast and furious,overal it is just not that funny and the plot gets tiring much too quickly.The Hotel Transylvania is just that,a hotel now run by Count Dracula.He opened it as a get away for monsters of all kinds,from the humans who stalk them in the outside world.He is very protective of his daughter Mavis who is coming of age,and he is super anal of his staff and hotel.His daughter,who can turn into a bat like her father,wants to make her first trip to the outside world as promised,on her 118th birthday coming up.He allows her to go but,unknown to her,he has made an artificial town,brought zombies to life as the townsfolks,and told them to be""aggressive""towards her when she arrives.The plan works and she returns home disappointed.Into Dracs world comes a young teen who is backpacking through the area and stumbles onto Dracs hotel.Drac tries to hide him from the rest of the patrons(and it's a full house of monsters)because they'd be horrified to have the very thing they are trying to get away from,be there as a guest.Eventually Drac must come up with a nom de plum for him,so he dresses him up and calls him Johnny Stein.He poses as Frankies long lost cousin,and Frankie buys it.Johnny starts ingratiating himself to all the patrons who really come to like him,especially Dracs daughter.Through alot of near misses and faux pauxs,Johnny's real identity is always justhisclose to being found out.And Drac is constantly beside himself with trying to run his motel and/or trying to either get rid of,or hide,Johnny.The chef of the hotel,Quasimodo,along with his buddy the Fly,come to suspect the truth and try to tell the patrons the turth about Johnny,but is stopped by Drac.However something happens during all this frenticism of Dracs.He actually comes to like him.In the end his misguided ""duty""to his patrons and his over protectiveness towards Mavis,forces him to finally give Johnny the kiss off.Johnny,under duress,deliberately spurns Mavis'advances and affections,and he boards a jet back home.Mavis is in the doldrums and without Johnny there the entire hotel is in a funk.Drac sees nothing to do but to get Johnny back.He flies in daylight,continually smoldering,risking his life to get Johnny's attention on the plane.He finally does and he manipulates the plane to fly back to the airport,much to the chagrin of the passengers.The film ends as Johnny and Mavis tie the knot and start their life together,with Drac's,and the entire patrons of the hotel's,blessings.The film is a kind of mixed bag throughout.Just as the jokes and plot seem to get going,the plot will either slow and/or the jokes start getting old and fall flat.There are some cute moments such as the time Drac and Mavis have a heart to heart,and Mavis,as a bat,starts pouting.It's an adorable look.It also has some neat touches such as scream cheese.But these little bon mots just aren't enough to save this film.As a result,I found it,unfortunately,a bit of a drag.Now the kids,that MAY be a different story.They may like it to a certain extent,but I kind of think even they would be squirming in their seats through parts of this film.This film to me is kind of another another Arthur(see my review on that),but just a cut above even that.Technically speaking the film is in its w/w a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,some musical vids and a featurette.All in all not as good as I thought it might or should be.The jokes are old and the cutesy factor,as good as it was(obviously geared for the kids),could not overcome the film's basic handicap;that of an uneven storyline and the stop and go nature it created.I fall in the middle on this one;almost enough to fall below the 3 star line(but not quite),but way below a 4 star rating.",3,MAYBE for the kids;adults not so much,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,4367,"['Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'released', 'Sept/12', 'yet',

Of course Mavis Dracula (Selena Gomez), Count Dracula's daughter, Frankenstein (Kevin James), and human Jonathan (Andy Samberg), also turn in very funny performances but Sandler and Buscemi are still the best. The animation is good, but nothing along the lines of any of the Pixar films, but then again who is!The basic premise of the film is that Count Dracula's daughter, Mavis, is turning 118 years old and wants to leave home and go out and explore the world. However, her father is afraid of humans and fears for his daughter's safety. Therefore, he devises a plan to keep her at home and safe under his watchful eye. Meanwhile, monsters of all kinds and from every possible part of the planet come to Hotel Transylvania for a safe vacation and to help celebrate Mavis' upcoming birthday, and that's where things take a turn for the worse. Enter Jonathan, a 21 year old human male who accidentally finds himself at the hotel after hearing rumors of it's existence in a nearby village. Of course hilarious hi-jinks ensue as Dracula feverishly attempts to keep Jonathan's status as a human hidden from everyone's perception by passing him off as a Frankenstein, a sixth cousin thrice removed to the original Frankenstein's right arm. I'll give you a minute there to figure that one out.This seems to work out okay except for the fact that his daughter Mavis has now felt the ""zing"" when she first saw Jonathan as did he. Can't have a good animated monster movie without the obligatory love story. Anyhow, chaos ensues with various monsters and there are a lot of funny scenes that will definitely go over the heads of the younger crowd, but the teens and adults in the movie will probably pick most of the subtle adult oriented humor up pretty easily. Although nothing that a parent would really have to worry about as I am quite sure the younger crowd will miss most if not all of the adult directed humor and will instead focus more on the variety of cool looking monsters and juvenile humor.One of the many things that I found really funny was how the writers created an exact opposite outlook on humans as monsters from the monsters point of view, which mirror imaged everything we as humans learned about monsters. Kind of funny how that seems to imitate real-life at times.Be sure and pay real close attention for the part of the movie where they really slam the ""Twilight"" series (Hint: It is towards the end of the movie). That alone was worth the cost of the ticket!

(You could say he's a tad over-protective.) Her friends are mummies, Frankenstein monsters, werewolves, and the like. But daddy's little ghoul is all grown up and ready to explore the world. Then one night the unthinkable happens: a teenage human enters Hotel Transylvania, and he and Mavy fall in love.  It's Drac's worst nightmare, and it's very funny.I like this movie a lot, enough to want it in my collection, but I do feel it lacks the tension necessary to make this a great movie.The reason behind Drac's extreme measures for protecting Mavy from humans isn't shown until very late in the movie, which makes it hard to relate to Drac, who is the main character. If that information had come at the start, he would have been easier to identify with, and we would want to see Mavy protected from humans, too. Alternatively, Mavy could have been the main character, because her conflict is real and clear. She wants to explore the world, fall in love, and grow up, but her dear, loving, undead dad won't let her. There's a lot of tension in that. More scenes that brought that out and starting the movie with her growing up, instead of as a baby, could have brought that tension into the movie. I understand why it's done the way it is, though. It's a safe movie for little kids this way, and it does make Adam Sandler the star of the show. Still, this makes it just a fun and funny movie, instead of one that's fun, funny, and really makes you feel.So get it for the kids if they like monsters that aren't scary, or for yourself if you're an Adam Sandler fan.",4,"Fun, funny, cute, and not at all scary",1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1683,"['Mavy', 'life', 'full', 'monsters', 'dad', 'Dracula', 'created', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'protect', 'humans', 'could', 'say', 'tad', 'over-protective', 'friends', 'are', 'mummies', 'Frankenstein', 'monsters', 'werewolves', 'like', 'daddy', 'little', 'ghoul', 'grown', 'up', 'ready', 'explore', 'world', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'teenage', 'human', 'enters', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'Mavy', 'fall', 'love', 'Drac', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'very', 'funny.I', 'movie', 'lot', 'enough', 'want', 'collection', 'do', 'feel', 'tension', 'necessary', 'make', 'great', 'movie.The', 'reason', 'Drac', 'extreme', 'measures', 'protecting', 'Mavy', 'humans', ""n't"", 'shown', 'very', 'late', 'movie', 'hard', 'relate', 'Drac', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'information', 'had', 'come', 'start', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'identify', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'Mavy', 'protected', 'humans', 'too', 'Alternatively', 'Mavy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'main', 'character', 'conflict', 'real', 'clear', 'explore', 'world', 'fall', 'love', 'grow', 'up', 'dear', 'loving', 'undead', 'dad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'lot', 'tension', 'More', 'scenes', 'brought', 'out', 'starting', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'instead', 'baby', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'tension', 'movie', 'understand', 'why', 'done', 'way', 'though', 'safe', 'movie', 'little', 'kids', 'way', 'make', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'star', 'show', 'Still', 'just', 'fun', 'funny', 'movie', 'instead', 'one', 'fun', 'funny', 'really', 'feel.So', 'get', 'kids', 'like', 'monsters', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', ""'re"", 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan']",N/A

1322847,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B0034G4OYA,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[109, 126]","Hotel Transylvania, directed by Genndy Tartakovsky from a screenplay by Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel, is an animated comedy/horror-spoof, mostly for the kids but fast-paced enough and with enough humor to keep everyone entertained for an hour and a half. It's not as smartly written as 2010's Megamind or as sophisticated and dazzling as 2011's Rango, but it is fun to watch and satisfying in a popcorn-movie kind of way. Adult fans of old horror films will like spotting some of the more obscure monsters (Brain From Planet Arous anyone?) and picking up on some references that will sail over the head of younger viewers.The plot begins in 1895 where we find a very paternal Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) looking after his infant daughter not long after the death of his wife. Determined to keep her safe from ""the humans"", Dracula comes up with an idea - to create a sanctuary, a place where monsters of all kinds can come to relax and be themselves without having to constantly worry about humanity coming after them with torches and pitchforks. He directs his servants to convert an old medieval castle hidden deep in the remotest part of Transylvania into a resort/retreat for monsters from all over the world, and voila! - the Hotel Transylvania is born.  The hotel is staffed, appropriately, by zombie bellhops, haunted suits of armor, housekeeping witches and talking shrunken heads, with a kitchen overseen by an obsessed lunatic chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz) and his pet rat Esmeralda.Of course the years seem to fly by for a parent, even an immortal one, and before Dracula knows it suddenly it's 2012 and the day of Mavis's 118th birthday (that's 18 in human-growth years). The castle is filled with guests, many of them old friends of the family who've come especially for the occasion, including a very domestic Frankenstein (Kevin James) and his high-bouffant wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), a life-of-the-party mummy named Murray (CeeLo Green), a very frazzled werewolf named Wayne (Steve Buscemi in superb form), his highly-pregnant wife Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their pack of snarling hyper-active wolf kids, and Griffin, the Invisible Man (David Spade) who can't understand why he sucks at playing charades.But this is also a day Dracula has dreaded as he promised Mavis (Selena Gomez) that on the day she turned 118, she had his permission to go out into the world. Compelled to keep his word but unable to face the prospect of Mavis going off into what he feels is a world too dangerous for her, he concocts a scheme to scare her into wanting to stay at the castle. Which works, somewhat to his surprise. But his scheme turns out to have unintended consequences and before Dracula has time to feel relieved, the unthinkable happens - a _human_ suddenly appears at the hotel, a young backpacker named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) who ""heard about this cool old castle"" and wanted to check it out. Panicking, and fearing for the reputation of his hotel if it were found out that a human was on the premises, Dracula quickly disguises Jonathan as ""Johnny-stein"", a supposed cousin of Frankenstein (actually just a cousin of Frankenstein's right hand, as it were). But before Dracula can get Jonathan out of the castle and out of his hair, Mavis and Jonathan meet and ""zing!"" it's love at first sight. The rest of the plot is rather predictable - over-protective father wants to keep boy away from his daughter, but daughter and boy keep seeing each other - but the pacing is kept fast enough and the humor abundant enough that it keeps things fresh and funny all the way through.  Particularly in scenes where Johnny's fun-loving nature livens things up by inadvertently starting a horses-and-riders pool fight, introducing some new music over the grumbling protests of zombie-Beethoven, zombie-Mozart & zombie-Bach, and engages Dracula in a floating-table race, causing the stiff and stuffy Count to unexpectedly rediscover what fun is.The animation, while not ground-breaking, is well done, with a lot of attention to detail which gives the film a level of texture you wouldn't ordinarily expect in a light comedy. For example, at one point Mavis leads Johnny into a cave, the entrance to which some horror aficionados will recognize is shaped like the face of the Phantom of the Opera.  While Genndy Tartakovsky is well known for his work producing several successful TV animated series (Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, The Grimm Adventures of Billy & Mandy, The Powerpuff Girls and Star Wars: The Clone Wars), Hotel Transylvania is his first feature film.  Fans of Tartakovsky 's TV work might be expecting something more in the distinctive style he used in those shows, but I don't think they'll be disappointed with his choice to be more traditional here. The production design was done by Marcelo Vignali, who worked on several Disney films including Mulan and Lilo & Stich as well as Cloudy With Chance Of Meatballs, and the art direction was done by Ron Lukas and Noelle Triaureau, both of whom also worked with Vignali on 2007's Surf's Up.The voice cast is excellent.  Adam Sandler, whom I don't usually care for as a rule, is actually quite good as the over-protective fatherly Dracula.  Andy Samberg brings out Johnny's guileless but ever-upbeat goofiness in a very winning way, while Selena Gomez brings the perfect touch as Mavis, the teenage vampire cutie who loves her dad and all his old weird friends but just wants to get out there and see the world she's only heard stories about.  Kevin James does an affable Frankenstein, and Fran Drescher is perfect as his loud and brassy Franken-wife, Eunice. CeeLo Green's Murray is the liveliest and hippest mummy you've ever heard.  As always though, it's Steve Buscemi who gets the best lines (or who makes his lines the best ones by his inimitably wry delivery) as the much put-upon buttoned-down-shirt-and-tie-wearing werewolf Wayne.  One of my favorite scenes is where Dracula, Frank and Wayne are trying to track down Johnny.  Dracula wants Wayne to follow his scent, and Wayne can only sigh wearily and ask ""Do you have _any_ idea what years of changing poopy diapers have done to this nose?""Recommended as a fun enjoyable film for everyone and in particular for classic horror-film fans.",4,"Monster comedy, mostly for the kids, but fast-paced & funny enough to keep everyone entertained",1349136000,"10 2,
