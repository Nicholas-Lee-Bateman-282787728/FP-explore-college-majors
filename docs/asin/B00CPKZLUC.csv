1649858,A1OTAOJ9YYRKV2,B00CPKZLUC,"John Vinacci ""Theory Parker""","[0, 0]","movie is why synonyms for &#34;awful&#34; exist. What is billed as an alien invasion movie attempts, rather poorly, to be a psychological thriller that thinks it's going to be clever by tying all the flash forwards (read: loose ends) together at the end. Problem is (well, there are lots of problems), the flash forwards are ultimately meaningless. Worse, when it comes to apocalyptic invasions, the audience needs someone to root for, and none of the characters here qualify. The overly long night club scene and subsequent sex scene do nothing to endear us to these characters, which is particularly criminal when you consider that the movie begins with these scenes. Nor do we ever get to see the aliens, having to settle for them in human disguise, presumably because the director wasted his budget on the two shots of an alien mothership hovering over town. Finally, the climactic sequence at the barn is a headscratcher; did other alien space ships come in to save the day or were they our own aircraft? The SFX are so bad it's hard to tell. All the lens flares, tricky camera angles, English accents, two Van Dammes, and fist fights out of left field can't save this one.

By the end, I was wondering what happened. The movie has some confusing bits, the acting, at points, is frustrating, the camera moving in a circle outside the supermarket made me dizzy, the special effects were puzzlingly bad (might have been intentional...not sure), but somehow...I enjoyed it.So give this one a try.

1649862,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B00CPKZLUC,maskedgamer,"[4, 4]","and that's exactly what is wrong with it.It didn't hardly make any sense and the plot contradicts itself. So many things occur in the film that are never answered at all. Not to mention that the film is just one long dubstep sound track that really does get annoying after the opening scene. Seems like they were writing one story then decided to change it because they knew the original idea sucked but then realized they didn't have the budget to make the new changes work, so they just stuck with what they had and went for it. There's barely any &#34;aliens&#34; in this movie. Just CGI garbage that loops over and over in the background and it look incredibly faked because you can tell it's a looping CGI image as no one reacts to it at all.Then there's how everyone reacts to what is going on. Okay, a giant alien space ship just landed and you think people would be going completely nuts and running for their lives in complete fear but instead they just walk around like it's Sunday afternoon. I've seen bigger reactions to black Friday at Walmart. Then when the aliens finally start attacking and the only logical person in the movie (the neighbor) who is scared ----less (finally a real reaction to the aliens) tells them to run as he tries to escape they all just decide to go back inside the house.If there ever was an unnecessary alien movie this is indeed it. Then after some pointless scene where the group breaks off to find bullets we're introduced to the biggest plot hole. We're we see the guys new found love starts acting a bit strange. I'll just explain this part since none of the movie makes sense anyhow. At first we see the girl content on helping a family of people trapped in a car. Then we see her stand by as she watches her new boyfriend almost have his life ended as she steps in at the last final moment to save his life and she goes on to talk about how she doesn't wish to kill or hurt anyone she then goes on and later blows his head off like he had dandruff or something while attacking 2 other people in the process and taking a hostage with her. This is just how little sense the movie makes. What also doesn't make sense is that the aliens have a mark on their legs so the the girl and the guy go into the room for her to take her clothes off so he can see if she has the alien symbol on her. Okay yeah that's a fine idea except it's like the movie forgot that he has already scene her completely naked because they had sex less than 24 hours ago where we watched her taking off all her clothes. Okay did the movie forget that? Also this guy had sex with an alien how did he not tell that something was wrong?The other major plot disaster is the ending. Apparently there's supposed to be two alien groups fighting each other for control of earth. One that looks humanoid and I'm guessing one that doesn't since the glimpse we see of an alien with a girls camera phone obviously isn't human (that scene is also never brought up again). So you're left wondering what even happened. I thought maybe there were two alien clone races myself but then why would the girl hesitate to attack the other alien humanoid, why would they be at the same club, and why would she seem upset for having to kill him, and even more importantly why would they have the same symbol if they were not of the same group? So we end the movie watching these two alien races fight each other in space while a TV broadcast comes on after the power is restored while a message saying earths forces had fought off the invaders is displayed. This of course is all after this long attempted rape scene and love confession while in the middle of escaping an alien battle.This was one ending that made no sense and came out of no where. I guess watching this you could put together a better logical ending yourself but this brainless movie is not worth the effort. It doesn't make sense because the story is all over the place. I tried to figure out the producer wanted us to know that the humanoid aliens were there to protect the humans and had to show themselves as they fought off the bad aliens and when they defeated them they decided to cover up by saying that earths forces defeated the aliens so the good aliens could go back to spying on humans because I'm sure no one realized that earths forces don't have flying spaceship fighter jets yet and they also didn't realize there were 2 different aliens just like the rest of us watching this movie.This movie was so bad it should have never been released. as for Jean Claude Van Damme I guess he's only in this because his daughter is in this movie playing a lead role. This movie was a waste of Van Damme and Van Damme should have taught his daughter some karate moves and that spinning kick thing so she could star in her own films without having to drag him into it just to make it worth watching.",1,This movie didn't make any sense at all...,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,4864,"['exactly', 'what', 'wrong', 'it.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'hardly', 'make', 'sense',

Years earlier the Aliens arrive on Earth and start taking over important government positions. Van Damme is the head of an elite unit trained to identify and track down these Aliens. In the first scene of the movie: a young man picks up what he thinks is a Hot Date. His pick up is a female Alien looking Van Damme. The young man was once in his elite unit. The next scenes portray chaos after a large Alien Ship is sighted stationed over the country. This reminds me of news footage I saw after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. The young man does hook up with Van Damme and the Aliens know where to find him. Aliens Win! The last scenes: a second fleet of Aliens arrive. There is a war in the sky between the two Alien forces. This is like the old black and white westerns I watched as a child. The cavalry shows up after the Indians have already massacred the wagon train.

Jean-Claude Van Damme.This title is under the general release umbrella of Phase Four films,the same company that brought us such OSCAR &#34;contenders&#34; as Alien Armageddon and BloodRayne:The Third Reich.This film then fits right in with that companie's general dynamic and raison d'etre.Alien Uprising is yet another turkey that should give the aliens in this movie cause to invade.Any race that would create/inflict such a film into the universe,deserves extinction.The story,for what it is,finds a group of four friends,three guys and a girl,out night clubbing in England.As the plot progresses we are privy to quick intercut scenes from the future that foretell the dire path they are on.One of the guys proposes to the girl who is his long time love and she accepts.One of the other guys brings home a girl he picked up at the bar.Needless to say,both guys get lucky.They wake up the next day and the power is out in a wide area.In fact a next door neighbour heads south to meet up with his wife who works in a branch of the military.He says he will relay any info about the power outage when he gets back.The next day they are awakened by the sound of the house trembling.They rush outside to see a huge UFO hovering above the town.Thinking the worst(invasion)they rush down to a grocery store for supplies.While there a small riot breaks out,and one of the guys is forced to draw his weapon on two thugs who attempt to take their goods.They arrive back home and the guy and the girl he picked head out to his place to get more ammo for his gun.Along the way they save a girl from a car wreck and take her to get medical attention.They find a pharmacy guarded by a cop.A struggle ensues between the guy and the cop,with the cop eventually being killed by his girl friend.We are shown a purple mark on the dead cops leg afterwards.Back at the house the two guys leave to steal a car,leaving the girl behind alone.However aliens soon enter the house and she is forced to flee.Outside an alien probe is just about to waste her when two soldiers destroy the probe.As they stand talking,the two guys show back up,unable to get a car,and the other one with his girlfriend.When a tramp sneaks up and grabs one of the soldiers sidearms,the soldiers are forced to shoot him.Unfortunately one of the guys is killed in the process.The remainder then drive to an ex black ops military man's house(Van Damme).He informs the group that he has a piece of alien technology and that he and his military bosses have for years suspected alien infiltrators,that look and talk like us.The only way of telling them from humans is a purple mark.The little girl then asks:&#34;Like the one on the policeman?&#34;.The ex ops man tells them to stick with only people they know.They all turn and look at the girlfriend  the guy picked up two nights before.The military guys want to search her but her boyfriend agrees to do it.Alone in the room she shoots him dead.The others come in and she manages to overpower them all and escape outside,where a probe beams her inside of it.More probes come and as the ex black ops man offers up his piece of alien technology to them,he is disintegrated.As the rest wait to be killed,suddenly other UFOs come out of the sky and attack the alien UFOs.Back inside the house with just the little girl,one of the guys, a military man left alive,and the other girl,the now apparent alien girl who was beamed into the probe,is now seen broadcasting on TV.She is saying the earth people have won the war and to remain inside.Just then an armed assault team enters the house saying there is a little girl that can identify them.The team then kills the rest of the survivors.Fade to black.The film doesn't give out with the answers and one is kind of left to fend for themselves,plot wise.The different attacking UFOs near the end is a puzzler.One can assume,though this is guessing,that they are earth made technology and that the military has been secretly waiting for just such an invasion to use them.The film goes along slowly but surely until the scene where they try and get the little girl into the pharmacy for some medical supplies.The producers seemed to have a lot invested in the fight scene that takes place.It goes on far too long,and the film thereafter seems to drag terribly.Jean Claude Van Damme's appearance is token at best,but he makes the best of what he has to do.He appears as this black ops guy who lives by himself.We first see him on the ground looking up from underneath a soldiers legs with a shotgun.&#34;And your name is?&#34;.And of course Van Damme gets to do some of his legendary box kicking with his own daughter Bianca Bree.However you almost laugh when Van Damme gets killed.Just before the alien probe disintegrates him he says&#34;Oh S#$!&#34;.It happens so quickly and is edited the same way,that I started to laugh a little when I saw it.Bianca,by the way,needs a LOT of more time on screen to develop some proper acting chops.Her brother seems to be doing fine,but she is FAR from a steady career in acting.How she got top billing is beyond me as her part,while not as limited in scope as her fathers,is truly one that goes in and out of scenes like a fly,and with limited lines.By the way the outer cover of this DVD,is a cheat.No man with such goggles,appears any where in this film.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette and a trailer.All in all another lame brained film,with a been-there done-that kind of plot;and done FAR better elsewhere.It uses cheesy and cheap S/FX,with that quick and supposedly edgy you-are-there camera work(ala The Blair Witch Project),and the plot gets quite ponderous and slow.Until this one gets into the $5.00 bin at Walmart,like the others from Phase Four I mentioned above,give it a pass.",2,Even Van Damme can't save this turkey,1390348800,"01 22,

I am not a fan of his but if you are I should tell you he is in it for about 10 minutes. On the other hand this movie was actually better then I was expecting. The quality wasn't as cheesy as I was expecting and to me this was a better version of Skyline...also with a better ending that that one as well. I'm not saying this is amazing and rush out and see it but in terms of the latest B movies that Van-Damme has been in this is one of the better ones. Overall, much better then I expected.
