1337410,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B003DLTBXU,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 1]","The setup for this movie is that technology has been discovered by which a little device implanted into your wrist will tell you how many days, hours and minutes remain until you meet your soul-mate, your life partner. Then, when two people who are so matched actually meet, both of their devices chime or ring and flash, indicating that this is the one.Other than that, the world of this movie is our world without any alteration. The shops where they implant the devices look very much like mobile phone stores. It's a clever set-up which provokes all kinds of possibilities. And this movie does a good job of exploring some of the implications of living in a world where the delicious uncertainty that surrounds every new relationship is removed and where technology determines our most important and most personal decision - the choice of a mate.So we meet Oona who is pushing 30 but whose timer obstinately refuses to register anything -- meaning that her Mr Right has yet to buy an implant. Oona drags each man she meets to the Timer store to see if he is THE ONE - but none of them is. And then she falls in lust, and maybe more, with a younger kid who mans a checkout counter in a supermarket by day and plays drums in a band by night.We also meet Oona's half-sister and kid brother who is implanted on his 14th birthday and meets his intended three days later.This is an amusing movie that manages to be more than it seems.

The storyline involves Timers -- a device that when worn on the wrist, begins a countdown till when you meet your true love (if he/she has a timer, too).  Our main character, played by Emma Caulfield (and beautifully acted), has a timer that shows zeros, and she worries about what this means -- will she never meet her One?  Or has he just not gotten a timer yet.  There is a lot of excellent directing, great casting, and all the performers do a fine job.Beyond the basic plot, however, this film makes me wonder (and a lot of family debate after the movie was over) about whether or not there is a One And Only...  And how much does a person miss by being bound to waiting all the time.  Living, so to speak, in the future, rather than in the present.Some characters in this film chose to live with those they knew they loved, no matter what the timer said.  Some choose to obey the timers.

The story lives on the performances of two sisters: one who has a timer that has never started (which indicates that her perfect partner has not yet gotten a timer of their own implanted,) and the other who has a timer that shows she wont meet her perfect match for 14 years. The interplay of these two actresses is so convincing and struck such a realistic tone that I fell in love with this film for just them. The ultimate question of the film is whether or not there is a perfect match or if love is what we make of it. In both comedy and in deeper questions I found the film to be an excellent use of my time.For Netflix friends, this movie is currently available to watch on demand.

Distributors and reviewers always want to categorize films in this box or that box. Like SLIDING DOORS (and if you haven't seen that film, do so), TIMER doesn't fit neatly in any box. It isn't a science-fiction film -- though its premise has a science-fiction element. It also isn't a romantic-comedy -- though it has elements of romance and comedy. Just forget the categories. Natural scripting, great acting and fine directing by Jac Schaeffer make this a film worth seeing and talking about. And the events it portrays could never happen, right? Strangely enough, a few days before I watched TIMER, a friend had just returned from South America. One day during her journey she had visited an indigneous shaman, who had told her quite accurate matters about her life. Then the shaman told her when she will meet the ""love of her life"".

Seeing the ramifications of the Timer of the characters' lives made me rethink my fantasy, as watching Oona's dependance on the Timer's readings [or lack of] cause her more than a dose of heartache. I say I was ""dissapointed"" in my title, not by the film, but by Oona's final decision. However, I still really liked the movie becasue I think Oona acted in character: not all of us can let our hearts run free.The acting in the movie was wonderful, and even though there is not much in terms of characters development, Oona does try to change, which counts in my book.

1337416,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B003DLTBXU,Doug Erlandson,"[2, 2]","My wife and I took a chance on ""Timer"" a few weeks back when we sat down to watch our every Friday evening quirky movie. At first I was a bit skeptical of a movie where the basic premise is that through the implantation of a timer one can discover just how long it will be (down to the moment) before one finds one's soulmate, and that one's timer will buzz (as will that of one's soulmate) when that moment arrives. It had all the outward appearances of a one-joke movie that becomes tedious after the first five minutes.Nothing could have been further from the truth. ""Timer"" is funny, endearing, and surprisingly deep movie that is well worth watching. It brings up the age-old but elemental question of whether, if we could know with certainty something so important as to when we would meet our soulmate and when we did, we knew who that soulmate was, would we be better off? Much of the movie deals with the way the different characters deal with this very issue. (The movie also raises the issue, not specifically addressed in the movie itself, of whether human beings have the freedom to falsify what seems to be predestined by, in this case, refusing to have anything to do with the person the timers indicate is one's soulmate.)For a movie of this genre, the characters are surprisingly well developed.

1337417,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B003DLTBXU,Elisabeth,"[0, 0]","Knowing exactly who your soulmate is should seem like a blessing, but in this movie, it shows it can be a curse as well.In this story, there's a dating service that provides people with their exact soulmate...sort of.  What they do is plant a Timer device (a computerized chip) into your wrist that counts down the days when you'll meet your soulmate.  The night before, your Timer will zero out and then when you make eye contact with your destined soulmate, both of your Timers will beep at the same time.  However, for this to happen, you and your soulmate both have to be wearing Timers.The main character Oona has a Timer that's already zeroed out, but she hasn't met her soulmate yet.  The guys she dates don't have Timers so she doesn't know if they're her soulmate or not.  Not wanting to give her heart to the wrong guy, she persuades these men to get Timers implanted, but the results are disappointing.Her stepsister, who also has a Timer, passes her time by having one-night-stands with guys she knows aren't her soulmate.  She knows this for sure since these men all wear Timers that tell her they're not her soulmate.  She tries to persuade Oona to give one-night-stands a try, too, but that isn't Oona's style.Things, however, start to get complicated for both of them.  Oona meets a guy with a Timer that tells her he isn't her soulmate, but she's also feeling lonely, so she begins reconsidering her stepsister's casual lifestyle.  Her stepsister meets a guy who doesn't own a Timer and doesn't want one, but she could see herself getting serious with him, so considers getting involved with him anyway.This was an intriguing concept that brought up some questions like:-- What if you didn't know someone was your soulmate, would you take a chance on them anyway?-- What if you did know someone wasn't your soulmate, could you love them anyway?-- What if you were already married, would you want a Timer to tell you if you married your soulmate?  What if it says you didn't, would you divorce?-- What should you do once your soulmate appears?  They're standing right in front of you, now what?-- Is it possible to know who your soulmate is without a Timer?Depending on your perspective, these Timers can be viewed as either a blessing or a curse.  They're a blessing because they cut down the risk of divorce and unrequited love.  But they're also a curse because they take the mystery out of dating, they provide high expectations for strangers, and your soulmate could appear at the worst time possible.I thought this story had an original concept, but I was disappointed by the rushed ending.  It was the ending where things got really interesting and where this concept could've been explored further.

1337421,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B003DLTBXU,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","This cleverly (if flawed) plotted indy comedy has a lot going for it. Good writing. Good cast and only a touch of b.s.Here's the scoop. Most everyone in the near future is fitted with a ""Timer"" which will tell the wearer when they've met their true love. It appears we give off some chemical that can me matched with another person. When two compatible people start their ""countdown"" they know they will meet the day after they countdown to zero. Our heroine, Oona, and her step-sister Steph, like most everyone else, put all their faith in the ""Timer."" But things start to happen that begin to raise doubts in their minds.This is a clever, light comedy. Emma Caufield does a sweet job as Oona. Michelle Borth, as her step-sister Steph, is about as gorgeous a woman as I've ever seen, and she's a real pistol. They make a good, if opposite, pair. The approach to the writing is to check out all the things that can happen to people who rely on a device like this. What if you're approaching middle age and still haven't started your countdown? Will you be worried that you'll grow old alone? What if you're a young kid and you start your countdown right away? Will you miss out on all the exploration people now take for granted?

1337424,A38L1FZNX9MU0X,B003DLTBXU,Harold A. Fretheim,"[1, 1]","This film is a comedy but not a romantic comedy.  It is something rarer - it is a film that asks questions about finding love.  It uses a quasi-science fiction plot device to create a number of scenarios that pose real questions about romantic love: What would happen if we could have a device that could accurately tell us when we would meet our soulmate- and even beep to alert us when it happened? Provided, of course, that said soulmate has also acquired the device and the service.  Do we simply wait for love? Do we cynically engage in relationships or hookups to pass the time? Or is it cynical at all- Is it not possible to love truly love the 'wrong' person? But if we know that this is the wrong person isn't it wrong to pursue the relationship? Or not?  This movie is about the responsibility that each of us has for love.What if it happens at the wrong time? This question is posed by the story of Oona's much younger half-brother- far from being like an arranged marriage what happens is the exact opposite: As Soledad's mother notes the soulmate located by the Timer is not the one she would have chosen for her daughter and that she would have preferred that things had happened differently and not so quickly (these two soulmates have 'found' each other at the age of fourteen) and yet- if they are soulmates the fact that the two young kids are from opposites sides of the track should not matter- except that it may confront the two people with a different set of challenges. One of the most charming moments occurs in one of the last scenes of the film- when Jesse addresses Soledad in halting, very definitely newly learned Spanish, to tell her that he hopes that she will permit him to try to make her happy. And you realize that Jesse has not been being shackled and limited by the discovery of his soulmate- Instead  that knowledge has freed Jesse to grow, to become more than he otherwise would have been. Jesse has taken responsibility for his love- and in that moment we catch just a glimpse of the very fine man that he is going to be.",5,A VERY THOUGHTFUL COMEDY INDEED,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,2062,"['film', 'comedy', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'something', 'rarer', 'film', 'questions', 'finding', 'love', 'quasi-science', 'fiction', 'plot', 'device', 'create', 'number', 'scenarios', 'pose', 'real', 'questions', 'romantic', 'love', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'could', 'have', 'device', 'could', 'accurately', 'tell', 'when', 'would', 'meet', 'soulmate-', 'even', 'beep', 'alert', 'when', 'happened', 'Provided', 'course', 'said', 'soulmate', 'also', 'acquired', 'device', 'service', 'Do', 'simply', 'wait', 'love', 'Do', 'cynically', 'engage', 'relationships', 'hookups', 'pass', 'time', 'cynical', 'all-', 'not', 'possible', 'love', 'truly', 'love', ""'wrong"", 'person', 'know', 'wrong', 'person', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'pursue', 'relationship', 'not', 'movie', 'responsibility', 'love.What', 'wrong', 'time', 'question', 'posed', 'story', 'Oona', 'much', 'younger', 'half-brother-', 'far', 'being', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'what', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Soledad', 'mother', 'soulmate', 'located', 'Timer', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'daughter', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'things', 'had', 'happened', 'differently', 'not', 'so', 'quickly', 'two', 'soulmates', 'have', ""'found"", 'other', 'age', 'fourteen', 'yet-', 'are', 'fact', 'two', 'young', 'kids', 'are', 'opposites', 'sides', 'track', 'should', 'not', 'matter-', 'may', 'confront', 'two', 'people', 'different', 'set', 'challenges', 'One', 'most', 'charming', 'moments', 'one', 'last', 'scenes', 'film-', 'when', 'Jesse', 'Soledad', 'halting', 'very', 'definitely', 'newly', 'learned', 'Spanish', 'tell', 'will', 'permit', 'try', 'make', 'happy', 'realize', 'Jesse', 'not', 'been', 'being', 'shackled', 'limited', 'discovery', 'soulmate-', 'Instead', 'knowledge', 'freed', 'Jesse', 'grow', 'become', 'more', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Jesse', 'taken', 'responsibility', 'love-', 'moment', 'catch', 'just', 'glimpse', 'very', 'fine', 'man', 'going', 'be']",N/A
1337425,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003DLTBXU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","What if fun gets taken out of life? What if that sense of mystery is wrested away? TiMER on the surface is a quirky romantic comedy, but there's a bit of bleakness lurking about underneath, I think. Determinism warring with free will, fate versus serendipity, and you don't know towards which direction this film tilts 'til the closing credits are just about to drop on your butt.Emma Caulfield, I harbor a mad crush on her ever since she was the outspoken and ultimately fragile vengeance demon, Anya. Ever since BUFFY she's demonstrated a knack for timing and comedy and a brittle vulnerability, and all that's here, too. She anchors this film.In this film's reality, the path to true love can be mapped out. Fifteen years ago, the Timer was invented, a revolutionary biotech device which, when implanted into your wrist, counts down to when your soul mate comes into your life. The caveat is that your soul mate must also have an imbedded timer. Such isn't the case for the love of Oona O'Leary's life, and so her own wrist device reads frustratingly blank.Oona (Caulfield), like most orthodontists, is one of life's go-getters. What she's been doing is dating all manner of timer-less blokes and, whenever compatibility surfaces, she coaxes them into having a timer installed. But all for naught. None of 'em so far have proven to be her elusive soul mate. It's getting to her. In a surprising departure, the logical Oona strikes up an impulsive romance with the local supermarket clerk, Mikey, who is much younger than her. Except that Mikey (John Patrick Amedori) has a timer. Which is counting down to four more months to his true love. Oona opts to throw caution to the winds, to thumb her nose at fate. Except maybe fate isn't as fickle as widely rumored.As much as I liked TiMER, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, I respect writer/director Jac Schaeffer's opting for the road less traveled ending. On the other hand, I wanted to have my cake and eat it, too. Schaeffer doesn't neglect exploring the ramifications of destined love. There's a teen here whose timer instantly reveals that his own true love is only days away from meeting him, and, understandably, he's all sorts of unprepared for this. And then there's Oona's carefree younger step-sister Steph (a marvelous Michelle Borth) whose straits are even more dire than her own. Steph won't meet her intended other until she's friggin' 43 years old. The fallout to this is that Steph sleeps around, and the subtext is that her carefree demeanor is laced with palpable desperation. Much as I was into Emma Caulfield's performance, the one whom I really felt for was Michelle Borth's character. When Steph reluctantly falls for a charming visitor in her workplace, you cross your fingers for her and you rage against determinism. For most of the story, Schaeffer seems to be advocating one message but then she pulls a switcheroo there at the end, and from that my conflict rises. Things do conclude with a decided glimmer of hope. And if you check out the DVD's deleted scenes, you may see an encouraging resolution to Steph's plight. TiMER is recommended for the cast's strong acting, for the  humor and the angst, and for the thought-provoking premise. I wish Emma Caulfield would do more films. I wish Michelle Borth's THE FORGOTTEN would be made available for DVD already.The DVD's special features: Audio Commentary by writer/producer/director Jac Schaeffer; ""The Making Of TIMER"" (00:08:47 minutes long); ""Inside the TIMER Store"" - how Schaeffer patterned her friendly Timer shop after those colorful cell phone service centers (00:01:35 minutes); 5 Deleted Scenes; pretty good Bloopers (00:03:17); and two trailers.",4,"synchronicity, murdered by the wrist watch of love",1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,3682,"['What', 'fun', 'taken', 'life', 'What', 'sense', 'mystery', 'wrested', 'away', 'TiMER', 'surface', 'quirky', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'bit', 'bleakness', 'lurking', 'underneath', 'think', 'Determinism', 'warring', 'free', 'will', 'fate', 'versus', 'serendipity', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'towards', 'direction', 'film', 'tilts', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'just', 'drop', 'butt.Emma', 'Caulfield', 'harbor', 'mad', 'crush', 'ever', 'was', 'outspoken', 'ultimately', 'fragile', 'vengeance', 'demon', 'Anya', 'Ever', 'BUFFY', 'demonstrated', 'knack', 'timing', 'comedy', 'brittle', 'vulnerability', 'here', 'too', 'film.In', 'film', 'reality', 'path', 'true', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'mapped', 'out', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'Timer', 'was', 'invented', 'revolutionary', 'biotech', 'device', 'when', 'implanted', 'wrist', 'down', 'when', 'soul', 'mate', 'life', 'caveat', 'soul', 'mate', 'must', 'also', 'have', 'imbedded', 'timer', 'Such', ""n't"", 'case', 'love', 'Oona', ""O'Leary"", 'life', 'so', 'own', 'wrist', 'device', 'frustratingly', 'blank.Oona', 'Caulfield', 'most', 'orthodontists', 'one', 'life', 'go-getters', 'What', 'been', 'doing', 'dating', 'manner', 'timer-less', 'blokes', 'whenever', 'compatibility', 'surfaces', 'coaxes', 'having', 'timer', 'installed', 'naught', 'None', ""'em"", 'so', 'far', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'elusive', 'soul', 'mate', 'getting', 'surprising', 'departure', 'logical', 'Oona', 'up', 'impulsive', 'romance', 'local', 'supermarket', 'clerk', 'Mikey', 'who', 'much', 'younger', 'Mikey', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Amedori', 'timer', 'Which', 'counting', 'down', 'four', 'more', 'months', 'true', 'love', 'Oona', 'throw', 'caution', 'winds', 'thumb', 'nose', 'fate', 'maybe', 'fate', ""n't"", 'as', 'fickle', 'widely', 'rumored.As', 'much', 'liked', 'TiMER', ""'m"", 'bit', 'torn', 'one', 'hand', 'respect', 'writer/director', 'Jac', 'Schaeffer', 'opting', 'road', 'less', 'traveled', 'ending', 'other', 'hand', 'wanted', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'Schaeffer', ""n't"", 'neglect', 'exploring', 'ramifications', 'destined', 'love', 'teen', 'here', 'timer', 'instantly', 'own', 'true', 'love', 'only', 'days', 'away', 'meeting', 'understandably', 'sorts', 'unprepared', 'then', 'Oona', 'carefree', 'younger', 'step-sister', 'Steph', 'marvelous', 'Michelle', 'Borth', 'straits', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'dire', 'own', 'Steph', 'wo', ""n't"", 'meet', 'intended', 'other', 'friggin', '43', 'years', 'old', 'fallout', 'Steph', 'sleeps', 'around', 'subtext', 'carefree', 'demeanor', 'laced', 'palpable', 'desperation', 'Much', 'was', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'performance', 'one', 'whom', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'Michelle', 'Borth', 'character', 'When', 'Steph', 'reluctantly', 'charming', 'visitor', 'workplace', 'cross', 'fingers', 'rage', 'determinism', 'most', 'story', 'Schaeffer', 'be', 'advocating', 'one', 'message', 'then', 'switcheroo', 'there', 'end', 'conflict', 'Things', 'do', 'conclude', 'decided', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'may', 'see', 'encouraging', 'resolution', 'Steph', 'plight', 'TiMER', 'recommended', 'cast', 'strong', 'acting', 'humor', 'angst', 'thought-provoking', 'premise', 'wish', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'would', 'do', 'more', 'films', 'wish', 'Michelle', 'Borth', 'THE', 'FORGOTTEN', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'already.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'writer/producer/director', 'Jac', 'Schaeffer', 'Making', 'TIMER', '00:08:47', 'minutes', 'long', 'TIMER', 'Store', 'how', 'Schaeffer', 'patterned', 'friendly', 'Timer', 'shop', 'colorful', 'cell', 'phone', 'service', 'centers', '00:01:35', 'minutes', '5', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'pretty', 'good', 'Bloopers', '00:03:17', 'two', 'trailers']",N/A

It is sad as an audience we are left with terrible choices in the theaters in this genre (almost all of them carbon copies of each other!) while something with a refreshing concept and something new goes direct to video. Why? Oh well.I won't go into the plot as you can read that in the product description. This movie has relatable characters that you like (what a concept hollywood) and their actions are not out of character either. So often we are left with comedies that step so far out of the relm of reality that they become farces. Timer, although has a bit of a sci-fi bent to the plot, stays grounded.I like that it has something to say too. What would you do if you could have your fate told to you? If you didn't really have to look for love? It's an interesting idea. I think it explores that idea well without it overpowering the characters too. Having some people refuse to get a Timer, or having a sister with a date set decades from the present and how emotionally she handles that.

1337430,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B003DLTBXU,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[3, 4]","Have you ever wondered if their's really only ever one person out there for you?  If you have, then ""Timer"" should resonate with you.""Timer"" is not a romantic comedy in the traditional sense, as the comedy is not the normal slapstick or over the top comedy of most modern romantic comedy's, the comedy is in the idea itself.  The only other comparable romantic comedy I can think of isDefending Your Lifebecause they share the same kind of comedy, a more quiet and satirical approach.  Both of these films are films that make you think about your life and why you think and believe the things you do, and chances are if you have seen or liked either of them, you will like the other.With this in mind and the fact that it is an independent film on a low budget should give you some kind of idea of what to expect. The idea that there is only one mate for a person, ie. a soul mate, is not a new idea, so it is interesting how this film takes that idea and and uses it as a central idea to ask such questions how real love develops and whether or not love is a feeling or commitment.Coming from a conservative Christian background and a woman who did wait for everything until marriage (including kissing), I strongly believe there is such a thing as a soul mate, but one thing I know is that there is not necessarily only one person per person (there is one person right for us in a particular point in time, and for some that is only one person in their entire life time), or else remarrying would be completely pointless.One of the story lines I enjoyed the most was the one about Oona's brother, he is only 14yrs and what happens to him can make us question whether or not love can grow out of an arranged courtship/marriage.  This film really does seem to punctuate the point that we make the choice whether or not to love someone, it is a daily choice to stick it out or to quit when things get tough (this is even more punctuated by the marital relationship of Oona's biological father and mother).  It is indeed nice to see a film, that genuinely seems to promote the choice of being committed to loving someone over just giving up because you ""don't have the time"" or the ""feelings"" are gone.  If I lived by those sort of standards, I wouldn't have reliable family, friends, or a husband.  All good relationships take time and investment and its always better, once you've committed yourself to put in the committment rather than taking the easy out (of course there are some exceptions, but I wont get in to that here.).The conclusion of the film was not necessarily satisfactory, but in a movie such of this nature, any ending is going to displease some people because most people have differing ideas of how a person should react in certain circumstances, especially those pertaining to love. So whether or not you enjoy this movie rest largely on whether or not you are open to the option of one person being your soul mate and whether or not that one person is a choice, or something that is unavoidable regardless, much like the way the timers in the film alert the wearers when they come in contact with their ""true love"", is there something inside of us that goes off when we meet ""The one""?  I would venture to say yes based on my own experience, though for me, it did not happen until a year after I had been friends with the person.On the whole, the acting is good all around, the script is very smart and refreshing, not perfect, but smarter than your average rom-com, and although you can tell its an indie film, the film looks crisp and clean, its more the tone that gives it an ""indie"" feel then the look.

1337432,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B003DLTBXU,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","Those are some of the questions asked by this definitely very original, unusual and quite clever little film, which combines successfully a typical romantic comedy with a solid dosage of Sci-Fi. Below, some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.A futuristic corporation produces a matchmaking device. For a monthly fee, the company can equip anyone with a TiMER that counts down until the moment when the customer meets his/her soul mate. The night before meeting a soul mate, the TiMER reaches zero and will beep when the soul mates meet the following day. After more than fifteen years of operational existence, the TiMER is considered 98% efficient... This is basically the introduction which takes the first three minutes of the film - and then, we meet Oona, a smart and sexy orthodontist played magistrally by Emma Caulfield and her smart and even more sexy half-sister Stephanie (""Steph""), played by Michelle Borth.I will say no more about the scenario, but it is a pretty strong thing, mixing humor, drama, emotionally strong scenes and quite a lot of suprisingly tough questions...Actors did a VERY good job in this film! I will never forget Emma Caulfield's performance as Anya in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and as she plays little, I missed her a lot since those series ended. Watching her in this film was a pleasure. I never saw Michelle Borth in anything before ""TiMER"", but she was GREAT and really hot in this film.Both male characters who appear in the film were well conceived and well interpeted - exuberant young Mikey, played by John Patrick Amedori (unknown to me before this film) and more mature and rather serious, even grave Dan played by Desmond Harrington (instantly recognizable to all ""Dexter"" fans).This film is not a great masterpiece, but it is a very original, intelligent, bitter sweet and ultimately surprisingly serious romantic comedy, with likeable characters and - surprise, surprise - NO villains. It was for me a very, very pleasant surprise. Recommended for all amateurs of romantic comedies, Sci-Fi and good films in general. Enjoy!",5,"Is our fate already written?

1337433,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B003DLTBXU,Margaux Paschke,"[2, 2]","This movie hooked me from the start.  Let's say technology allowed for a devise that could be inserted into your wrist that counted down to the day you would find your true love.  Would you get one?  Our heroine, Uma, did but hers never set a date while those all around her blinked with a true love countdown.  Uma's step-sister also had a Timer with no love on the horizon.  The two of them were very close but had very different views on how to handle their Timer issues.  Uma hunted down every available man to find her true love and even talked  boyfriends into getting the Timer to find out of they were meant to be while her step-sister fooled around, attempting to get as much out of live since her Timer told her she wouldn't find her true love until she was 42.This movie was fascinating in it's questioning of fate and true love in modern times.  There were so many paths the characters lives could have taken and I'm not sure that technology can predict better then your own heart.  The match that Uma finally makes through the ""Timer"" could have as easily been made when her sister set her up with him much earlier except at that point, he did not have a ""Timer.""  Uma would never had the technological guarantee if she had met him through her sister so would they still have ended up together?  This movie makes you think about all the little things that can affect an outcome.Both sisters found real relationships but society's complete faith in the Timer interfered with what might have been had all the people involved listened to their hearts instead of technology.  All of the characters were as intriguing as the script and I highly recommend this chick flick.

Before scruffy Justin Timberlake and adorable Amanda Seyfried got into an awkward relationship in a dystopian world where time is money in 2011's In Time, scruffy John Patrick Amedori and adorable Emma Caufield were in an awkward relationship in a dystopian world where love is money in 2009's TiMER.Caufield plays pert orthodontist Oona, wracked by certainty; she has a TiMER but the countdown hasn't started on hers, which means her soul mate has yet to get a device implanted on his (or her!) wrist. So Oona cycles through a series of very short relationships with boyfriends, cajoling them into getting a TiMER only to dump them when it becomes clear that they're not meant to be.The TiMER organization has all the friendly efficiency of a Scientology center, complete with politely persistent counselors.  TiMERs work - always - but they require a certain level of commitment and patience.  Oona and her blended family, including loose stepsister Steph (Michelle Borth) and her uptight mother Marion (JoBeth Williams), are obsessed with the TiMER's results, which only heightens their collective anxiety for themselves and each  other.  Marion divorced her husband over the fact that the TiMER indicated they weren't meant to be together; Steph sleeps with whomever she pleases because her TiMER has yet to countdown.At the crux of TiMER's plot is a definition of happiness.  The film takes at face value that the quest for a soul mate is always a worthy goal.  The question is if happiness can be found before that moment.  Are we better offer discovering our soul mate as soon as we are capable of romantic love, like Oona's younger brother Jesse (Hayden McFarland)?  Or is ignorance bliss?This question tortures Oona until she finally snaps and begins a torrid romance with checkout clerk Mikey Evers (John Patrick Amedori), several years her younger. Mikey, a drummer in a band called Truckbeef, wears a TiMER but confesses little interest in its results.  He's only too happy with a catch like Oona whom he correctly claims is ""way out of his league.""  And for a little while, Oona and Mikey are happy.  Until the TiMERs begin beeping...TiMER's one flaw is its failure to lay out early in the film how the devices work. It wasn't clear to me that TiMERs only start counting down when the soul mate gets one (it takes two to TiMER), and then once the future lovers are about to meet the TiMERs begin counting down to their encounter.  A faux infomercial detailing exactly how the TiMERs work would have helped me focus less on the things and more on the people.The ending is an unflinching look at the nature of relationships: The TiMERs are simple; it's people who make things complicated.

What if science could find your soul-mate, love no longer a question of pure feeling and random choices?The brilliant Emma Caulfield is Oona, an almost model citizen of the Time Revolution, a beautiful young woman who feels her internal(or scientific) clock ticking and brings every potential husband into the 'timer-toting revolution'. Unfortunately her timer is still blank, meaning her soul-mate has yet to convert to the technology leaving her a little lost without much hope.However when Oona meets Mikey(John Patrick Amedori) his youth and vibrant personality teach her to live life in a purer way,  without relying on a few small numbers.Just when Oona really begins to let go and connect with Mikey, her timer provides an impending date that she's put all too much thought into.Timer is an enjoyable, extensive life experience more important than the almost magical experience science can provide. Do we sometimes settle for a feeling that isn't necessarily love, or are soul-mates just a figure of speech?There are a few scenes that may fall short, but overall Timer is a fantastic change in the tired genre of modern romance-related Indie flicks. You're left with numerous internal dilemmas and questions not only about the film, but about yourself.You may not love it to death, but you will remember it.",5,"""Wow, how'd you get this far without a TiMER?""",1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,1511,"['neo-modern', 'quasi', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'Timer', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'authentically', 'excited', 'long', 'time.The', 'plot', 'alone', 'so', 'different', 'so', 'ground', 'breaking', 'breath', 'clean', 'fresh', 'air', 'What', 'science', 'could', 'find', 'soul-mate', 'love', 'no', 'longer', 'question', 'pure', 'feeling', 'random', 'choices', 'brilliant', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'Oona', 'almost', 'model', 'citizen', 'Time', 'Revolution', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'internal', 'scientific', 'clock', 'ticking', 'potential', 'husband', ""'timer-toting"", 'revolution', 'Unfortunately', 'timer', 'still', 'blank', 'meaning', 'soul-mate', 'yet', 'convert', 'technology', 'leaving', 'little', 'lost', 'much', 'hope.However', 'when', 'Oona', 'Mikey', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Amedori', 'youth', 'vibrant', 'personality', 'teach', 'live', 'life', 'purer', 'way', 'relying', 'few', 'small', 'numbers.Just', 'when', 'Oona', 'really', 'let', 'go', 'connect', 'Mikey', 'timer', 'impending', 'date', 'put', 'too', 'much', 'thought', 'into.Timer', 'enjoyable', 'extensive', 'life', 'experience', 'more', 'important', 'almost', 'magical', 'experience', 'science', 'can', 'provide', 'Do', 'sometimes', 'settle', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'love', 'are', 'soul-mates', 'just', 'figure', 'speech', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'may', 'fall', 'short', 'overall', 'Timer', 'fantastic', 'change', 'tired', 'genre', 'modern', 'romance-related', 'Indie', 'flicks', ""'re"", 'left', 'numerous', 'internal', 'dilemmas', 'questions', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'yourself.You', 'may', 'not', 'love', 'death', 'will', 'remember']",N/A
1337440,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,B003DLTBXU,T. Fisher,"[3, 3]","This movie is a real winner. It has a great story based on a wonderfully original plot device -- the existence of a Timer device, stamped into your wrist, that tells you precisely what day you will meet your soulmate, and actually rings when you meet him or her. But it can only tell you if your soulmate is also wearing a Timer -- which are sold in a stores in every mall, with monthly plans like for cellphones.The timer of Oona, a 30-year-old orthodontist, doesn't ever start counting down, so she's getting nervous. Very nervous. Is it because she will never find ""the one"", or because he hasn't bought a Timer yet?This is a romantic comedy, I suppose, but the comedy aspect is not the film's main strength. There is no slapstick, nothing raucous going on here. Rather, the film brings a science fiction sensibility into a very non-science-fiction context, using a non-existent technological breakthrough (a timer based on reading levels of ""oxytocin, the hormone of love"") to examine the nature human relationships. Does fate exist? Is there really a ""one"" out there for everybody? Or are free will and our own choices the important thing?I liked the film's originality. I liked that even 10 minutes before the end of the movie, I didn't know exactly how it was going to end -- although I did suspect it wouldn't be tragic.The music, by Andrew Kaiser, is also worth mentioning. Just what you would expect, and what the film needed, but brilliantly done. Lots of sounds like kitchen timers ticking, very rhythmic, but with an irrepressibly optimistic edge. Often reminiscent in mood and tone of the kind of music Annie Little makes.It is a smart movie, well acted, with very likable characters. It doesn't tell you what the answers are, but it raises good questions.

This was a chick flick, which for a change of pace even men enjoy, but it centered around an absurd premise.  It started off very slow and tried to build towards something, but got lost.  I did not like the ending, too much info was given so you could not make it end the way ""many/most"" of us believing in true love would have liked.  I wish it would have ended with true-love winning out over science.  The parts assigned to the actors were somewhere between cold and nasty.

I'm glad I did because ""Timer"", thanks to some compelling lead performances and an interesting premise, is an engaging watch.Orthodontist Oona (Emma Caulfield) has a timer implanted on her wrist. These timers once activated will count down to the time one will meet one's soulmate, but there's a catch - the other person will have to have a timer implanted as well. That's Oona's problem - she has a timer, but it hasn't started it's countdown because her supposed soul mate, wherever he might be, has not had a timer of his own implanted yet. So, time passes and Oona gets increasingly desperate, driven to drag ""timer-less"" men she's briefly dated to be implanted, only to discover none of them are her ""one"".As Oona approaches the big 3-0, she gets desperate and crabby, especially so when her 9th grader brother gets a timer implanted (I guess 14 is the legal age for implanting) and it starts a countdown almost immediately! Then Oona meets a younger man, a check-out clerk at the local grocery story and sparks fly between them. He has a timer that indicates he is 4 months away from meeting his soul mate, so will Oona break her own rules and date him?The story despite some holes in the plot, flows well, and there is also a sub-plot involving Oona's promiscuous stepsister, who is averse to dating timer-less men. There are also quite a few twists to keep this movie interesting. On the whole, this is a refreshing entry into a relatively small sub-genre in movies, and worth watching.",4,Refreshing entry into the sci-fi/rom-com genre,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,1606,"['popped', 'up', 'recommended', 'watch', 'movie', 'rental', 'website', 'subscribe', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Timer', 'thanks', 'compelling', 'lead', 'performances', 'interesting', 'premise', 'engaging', 'watch.Orthodontist', 'Oona', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'timer', 'implanted', 'wrist', 'timers', 'once', 'activated', 'will', 'count', 'down', 'time', 'one', 'will', 'meet', 'one', 'soulmate', 'catch', 'other', 'person', 'will', 'have', 'have', 'timer', 'implanted', 'as', 'well', 'Oona', 'problem', 'timer', ""n't"", 'started', 'countdown', 'supposed', 'soul', 'mate', 'wherever', 'might', 'be', 'not', 'had', 'timer', 'own', 'implanted', 'yet', 'So', 'time', 'passes', 'Oona', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'driven', 'drag', 'timer-less', 'men', 'briefly', 'dated', 'be', 'implanted', 'only', 'discover', 'none', 'are', 'one', '.As', 'Oona', 'big', '3-0', 'desperate', 'crabby', 'especially', 'so', 'when', '9th', 'grader', 'brother', 'timer', 'implanted', 'guess', '14', 'legal', 'age', 'implanting', 'countdown', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Then', 'Oona', 'younger', 'man', 'check-out', 'clerk', 'local', 'grocery', 'story', 'fly', 'timer', '4', 'months', 'away', 'meeting', 'soul', 'mate', 'so', 'will', 'Oona', 'break', 'own', 'rules', 'date', 'story', 'holes', 'plot', 'well', 'also', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Oona', 'promiscuous', 'stepsister', 'who', 'averse', 'dating', 'timer-less', 'men', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'twists', 'keep', 'movie', 'interesting', 'whole', 'refreshing', 'entry', 'relatively', 'small', 'sub-genre', 'movies', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
