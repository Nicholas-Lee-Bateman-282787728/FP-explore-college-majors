1634713,A3LKP6WPMP9UKX,B00BHO0STG,Anna V. Carroll,"[0, 0]","Like everyone else, I have tried, in vain, for years to buy this DVD.  Was thrilled to see last week that it was available, at last.  Now if I can just get my hands on the Faye Dunaway version.Jane Seymour was a splendid Wallis. Don't you know the real Wallis wished she looked as pretty? The first time I recall anyone adding the famous mole to Mrs. Simpson's chin.  Anthony Andrews did resemble the Prince, but in real life his hair was blond, not brown as in the film. I hope the Duke of Windsor wasn't as sullen and depressed as portrayed.  It was a heavy film from beginning to end.  There was no lightheartedness at all.  Surely there must have been moments during that time when there was much laughter. We don't see it in this version.The entire 100 minutes is beautifully photographed with what appears to be the actual buildings. Mr. Al Fayed must have given them permission to film inside her Paris home as every scene filmed there looks like the real deal.This movie is, after all, over 25 years old. It holds up very well. A great deal is left out.  If you want to watch the very best adaptation of their love story you will have to rent/buy Edward & Mrs. Simpson with Cynthia Harris playing the Duchess. She is, to my mind, the one actress who got Wallis down pat. There is a bit of the devil in Mrs. Simpson the way Ms. Harris plays her.  Ms. Seymour is too sweet in the role. I still watch Edward & Mrs. Simpson once or twice a year.  But it was a mini-series filmed during the time when the Duchess was still alive.While I won't be alive to learn the answer to this question, I do wonder if their lives will be of any interest 50 years from now.  Do the British youth of today even know who they were?  They're talking about Princess Diana and her tragic life on the throne.  For me, for always, I will always want to read every new book that comes out about Wallis and her David.  Their 'crowd' are no longer here.  One wishes one of their closest friends had written the truth before they died.  For obvious reasons, they couldn't.  The British aren't like us.  They have principles when it comes to opening up their personal lives for all to see.  When in doubt, don't.At the beginning of the film you see an aged woman who has just lost her soul mate.  It begins in Paris at their home on the day he dies.  It ends with her at his funeral in London. There was nothing uplifting about this story.  Yet, it is certainly worth watching to see the beautiful scenery and archive footage of royal life. I am really happy they have re-released this film.  I have wanted to see it for many, many years.  It was worth the wait.",5,A HEARTBREAKING TALE,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2639,"['everyone', 'else', 'have', 'tried', 'vain', 'years', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'last', 'week', 'was', 'available', 'last', 'Now', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'hands', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Seymour', 'was', 'splendid', 'Wallis', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'Wallis', 'wished', 'looked', 'pretty', 'first', 'time', 'recall', 'anyone', 'adding', 'famous', 'mole', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'chin', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'did', 'resemble', 'Prince', 'real', 'life', 'hair', 'was', 'blond', 'not', 'brown', 'film', 'hope', 'Duke', 'Windsor', 'was', ""n't"", 'sullen', 'depressed', 'portrayed', 'was', 'heavy', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'lightheartedness', 'Surely', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'moments', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'laughter', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'version.The', 'entire', '100', 'minutes', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'what', 'be', 'actual', 'buildings', 'Mr.', 'Al', 'Fayed', 'must', 'have', 'given', 'permission', 'film', 'Paris', 'home', 'scene', 'filmed', 'real', 'deal.This', 'movie', '25', 'years', 'old', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'A', 'great', 'deal', 'left', 'out', 'want', 'watch', 'very', 'best', 'adaptation', 'love', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'rent/buy', 'Edward', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'Cynthia', 'Harris', 'playing', 'Duchess', 'mind', 'one', 'actress', 'who', 'got', 'Wallis', 'down', 'pat', 'bit', 'devil', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'way', 'Ms.', 'Harris', 'Ms.', 'Seymour', 'too', 'sweet', 'role', 'still', 'watch', 'Edward', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'once', 'twice', 'year', 'was', 'mini-series', 'filmed', 'time', 'when', 'Duchess', 'was', 'still', 'alive.While', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'alive', 'learn', 'answer', 'question', 'do', 'wonder', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'interest', '50', 'years', 'now', 'Do', 'British', 'youth', 'today', 'even', 'know', 'who', 'were', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'tragic', 'life', 'throne', 'always', 'will', 'always', 'want', 'read', 'new', 'book', 'out', 'Wallis', 'David', ""'crowd"", 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'here', 'One', 'one', 'closest', 'friends', 'had', 'written', 'truth', 'died', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'could', ""n't"", 'British', 'are', ""n't"", 'have', 'principles', 'when', 'opening', 'up', 'personal', 'lives', 'see', 'When', 'doubt', ""don't.At"", 'beginning', 'film', 'see', 'aged', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'soul', 'mate', 'Paris', 'home', 'day', 'funeral', 'London', 'was', 'nothing', 'uplifting', 'story', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'archive', 'footage', 'royal', 'life', 'am', 'really', 'happy', 'have', 're-released', 'film', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'worth', 'wait']",N/A

I knew it had been released in Austrlia so I figured it was just a matter of time before it would finally make it to the US market.  Now I won't have to bring my ancient VHS tape of it to be transferred!!!  In my opinion, this version is perhaps the best rendering of the Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII love story.  Jane Seymour, as usual, is spot on with her Baltimore-American accent and Anthony Andrews perfectly captures the cadence of Edward VIII's speech.  His expressions and nuances showed that he truly studied the role.  There is also a nice cameo performance by the wonderful Olivia DeHavilland who portrays Mrs. Simpson's aunt.
