Nearly three hundred years later, famed playwright Christopher Marlowe adapted his story for the stage. Another 400 years later, the BBC took Marlowe's play and brought it to television.This 1969 play is a very good adaptation of the play. Ian McKellen (who played Gandalf & Magneto!) brings a refinement to the role, such as you might expect from the great actor. Indeed, the entire cast does a great job - the BBC was probably at its height when it did this production. Now, speaking of production, this play does show its age, and it was not as well produced as it could have been in 1969. But, that said, this is a very enjoyable play, one that was good then, and is just as good today!(Review of Edward II starring Ian McKellen and James Laurenson)",4,"Good then, good today!",1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,929,"['King', 'Edward', 'II', 'England', 'shocked', 'Medieval', 'England', 'open', 'bisexuality', 'was', 'deposed', 'was', 'murdered', 'say', 'having', 'red-hot', 'poker', 'thrust', 'up', 'anus', 'Nearly', 'three', 'hundred', 'years', 'later', 'famed', 'playwright', 'Christopher', 'Marlowe', 'adapted', 'story', 'stage', '400', 'years', 'later', 'BBC', 'took', 'Marlowe', 'play', 'brought', 'television.This', '1969', 'play', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'play', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'who', 'played', 'Gandalf', 'Magneto', 'refinement', 'role', 'such', 'might', 'expect', 'great', 'actor', 'Indeed', 'entire', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'BBC', 'was', 'probably', 'height', 'when', 'did', 'production', 'Now', 'speaking', 'production', 'play', 'show', 'age', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'produced', 'could', 'have', 'been', '1969', 'said', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'play', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'then', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'today', 'Review', 'Edward', 'II', 'starring', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'James', 'Laurenson']",Edward II
1234259,A20IIR0422G3A5,B001RUALEC,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","I cannot say too many good things about this play, as it seems to have all the best aspects of Elizabethan drama that may have been ""overdone"" in Marlowe's more famous ""Dr. Faustus"". The jewel in this setting is the performance of a very young Ian McKellen, almost unrecognizable compared to his Gandalf and Magneto roles, and even to his Shakespearean roles such as in King Lear.The staging is cramped. Everything happens on what appears to be a circle not much more than 30 feet in diameter, and McKellen seems to be in the middle of the stage for the entire performance. Actors enter or leave the circle from the four points of the compass. The plot swings between Edward II's two male favorite (probably lovers)Piers Gaveston and Spenser, both commoners. The nobility seem to be more upset with the fact that they are not nobles than the fact that they are not women.Edward II was the son of the powerful king Edward Longshanks (See ""Lionheart"")and father to the equally powerful Edward III. But Edward II's reign was a disgrace. And even thought Edward II was two kings before the beginning of the War of the Roses, which Shakespeare covers in eight plays, from Richard II to Richard III, Edward II takes advantages from its small scale, and its focus on one very strongly played part, done to a tee by McKellen. I read that this was a performance by which McKellen's reputation as an actor was made. I believe it.",5,Marlowe's Entrancing History Play,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,1419,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'play', 'have', 'best', 'aspects', 'Elizabethan', 'drama', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'overdone', 'Marlowe', 'more', 'famous', 'Dr.', 'Faustus', 'jewel', 'setting', 'performance', 'very', 'young', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'compared', 'Gandalf', 'Magneto', 'roles', 'even', 'Shakespearean', 'roles', 'such', 'King', 'Lear.The', 'staging', 'cramped', 'Everything', 'what', 'be', 'circle', 'not', 'much', 'more', '30', 'feet', 'diameter', 'McKellen', 'be', 'middle', 'stage', 'entire', 'performance', 'Actors', 'enter', 'leave', 'circle', 'four', 'points', 'compass', 'plot', 'swings', 'Edward', 'II', 'two', 'male', 'favorite', 'probably', 'lovers', 'Piers', 'Gaveston', 'Spenser', 'commoners', 'nobility', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'upset', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'nobles', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'women.Edward', 'II', 'was', 'son', 'powerful', 'king', 'Edward', 'Longshanks', 'See', 'Lionheart', 'equally', 'powerful', 'Edward', 'III', 'Edward', 'II', 'reign', 'was', 'disgrace', 'even', 'thought', 'Edward', 'II', 'was', 'two', 'kings', 'beginning', 'War', 'Roses', 'Shakespeare', 'eight', 'plays', 'Richard', 'II', 'Richard', 'III', 'Edward', 'II', 'advantages', 'small', 'scale', 'focus', 'one', 'very', 'strongly', 'played', 'part', 'done', 'tee', 'McKellen', 'read', 'was', 'performance', 'McKellen', 'reputation', 'actor', 'was', 'made', 'believe']",Edward II
1234260,A1COLSH5F56V8Z,B001RUALEC,David Cope,"[21, 25]","Christopher Marlowe's masterpiece, Edward II, is the first major English History play/tragedy in the renaissance canon, predating and providing a model for Shakespeare's Richard II and other plays of the genre (for that connection, see Charles R. Forker's magisterial introduction in the Manchester U Revels Plays edition).  It's also an important work in the lgbtq literary canon, as the love affair between Piers Gaveston and his king is the first open and unabashed representation of gay characters on the English stage, and the poetry of that love affair is marvellous.  The play also features a villainous cadre of Machiavellian lords and churchmen who despise Gaveston for his lower class beginnings, his and Edward's wasting of the nation's treasury, and for Gaveston's sexuality.As a film, the play is already known to many through Derek Jarman's 1992 experimental version of it, featuring good performances by an angry, spiteful Gaveston (Andrew Tiernan)and Queen Isabella (a young Tilda Swinton).  Its chief feature is a peculiar cutting and pasting of text and plotline, interlarding the play with a song performed by Annie Lennox and modern gay rights demonstrations and police brutality.That said, the 1969 BBC Edward II starring a very young and gorgeous Ian McKellen in a filmed stage performance of the play is a wonderful surprise, a delight in every way.  McKellen is more passionate, spontaneous, and utterly possessed by his role than I have ever seen him; he has obviously learned his chops, but there's a sense that this performance is 90% ""going on nerves"" in the best sense.  James Laurenson's Gaveston is more nuanced than Tiernan's, and the film itself is less polemic than Jarman's: it focuses much more closely on the depth of their love.  The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, and one should not be put off by the fact that this is a film of stage performance; the work is so good that one quickly overlooks the difficulties of transition.  Costumes bring one a humorous reminder of the colorful sixties, but they aren't too intrusive, and the film quality is very good, given the fact that this is a product of that decade.",5,Classic performance of Marlowe's masterpiece,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,2159,"['Christopher', 'Marlowe', 'masterpiece', 'Edward', 'II', 'first', 'major', 'English', 'History', 'play/tragedy', 'renaissance', 'canon', 'predating', 'providing', 'model', 'Shakespeare', 'Richard', 'II', 'other', 'plays', 'genre', 'connection', 'see', 'Charles', 'R.', 'Forker', 'magisterial', 'introduction', 'Manchester', 'U', 'Revels', 'Plays', 'edition', 'also', 'important', 'work', 'lgbtq', 'literary', 'canon', 'love', 'affair', 'Piers', 'Gaveston', 'king', 'first', 'open', 'unabashed', 'representation', 'gay', 'characters', 'English', 'stage', 'poetry', 'love', 'affair', 'marvellous', 'play', 'also', 'villainous', 'cadre', 'Machiavellian', 'lords', 'churchmen', 'who', 'despise', 'Gaveston', 'lower', 'class', 'beginnings', 'Edward', 'wasting', 'nation', 'treasury', 'Gaveston', 'sexuality.As', 'film', 'play', 'already', 'known', 'many', 'Derek', 'Jarman', '1992', 'experimental', 'version', 'featuring', 'good', 'performances', 'angry', 'spiteful', 'Gaveston', 'Andrew', 'Tiernan', 'Queen', 'Isabella', 'young', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'chief', 'feature', 'peculiar', 'cutting', 'pasting', 'text', 'plotline', 'interlarding', 'play', 'song', 'performed', 'Annie', 'Lennox', 'modern', 'gay', 'rights', 'demonstrations', 'police', 'brutality.That', 'said', '1969', 'BBC', 'Edward', 'II', 'starring', 'very', 'young', 'gorgeous', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'filmed', 'stage', 'performance', 'play', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'delight', 'way', 'McKellen', 'more', 'passionate', 'spontaneous', 'utterly', 'possessed', 'role', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'obviously', 'learned', 'chops', 'sense', 'performance', '90', '%', 'going', 'nerves', 'best', 'sense', 'James', 'Laurenson', 'Gaveston', 'more', 'nuanced', 'Tiernan', 'film', 'less', 'polemic', 'Jarman', 'much', 'more', 'closely', 'depth', 'love', 'supporting', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'fact', 'film', 'stage', 'performance', 'work', 'so', 'good', 'one', 'quickly', 'difficulties', 'transition', 'bring', 'one', 'humorous', 'reminder', 'colorful', 'sixties', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'intrusive', 'film', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'given', 'fact', 'product', 'decade']",Edward II

Mosley ""Itinerant""","[1, 2]","Kenneth Anger's &#34;Edward II&#34; is a reaction to the Thatcher via the play, and it is a commentary on Marlowe's play -- a secondary reading. What we did not have, though, and do not have, is a middle of the road standard reading of the play. This 1969 staging is all there is, and it's eccentric.The interpretation is not tragic. Edward is played as insane more than mistaken, and his lines are run through at an antic pace for two acts before the deposition scene -- as if the producers and directors were waiting for The Important Bit.

1234262,A2NE7D8GC41UCL,B001RUALEC,"Karen Amrhein ""Karen A.""","[0, 0]","This is a VERY 1960s production of Marlowe's ""Edward 2"".  There are no furnishing on the set, which is a simple ""marble"" floor of concentric circles, with curtains of chains around the perimeter.  The costumes are pseudo-medieval, but with psychedelic touches such as tie-dye capes and tabards.  Weird!The acting is too-earnest for my tastes.  I normally like Ian McKellen, but he and his colleagues are rather over-blown here.The story has strong homoerotic overtones and is quite violent: for adults only.  I can't say as I enjoyed it, but it was interesting to finally see.The best part of this DVD is an 80-minute supplement entitled ""The Marlowe Inquest"".  It uses excellent actors to play the roles of three barristers who subscribe to the three most prominent theories of Marlowe's death, along with ones playing Marlowe's contemporaries (Thomas Kidd, for example) who were involved in the ""Star Chamber"" investigation. The contemporaries of Marlowe are in period costume, while the inquest itself is set in modern times (the 1980s).  It's really a fine production -- far better than I anticipated -- and alone worth the price of the DVD.3-stars for ""Edward II"", 5-stars for ""The Marlowe Inquest"".",3,"King Edward, the 1960s called, they want their tie-dye capes back!",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,1204,"['VERY', '1960s', 'production', 'Marlowe', 'Edward', '2', 'are', 'furnishing', 'set', 'simple', 'marble', 'floor', 'concentric', 'circles', 'curtains', 'chains', 'perimeter', 'costumes', 'are', 'pseudo-medieval', 'psychedelic', 'touches', 'such', 'tie-dye', 'capes', 'tabards', 'Weird', 'acting', 'too-earnest', 'tastes', 'normally', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'colleagues', 'are', 'rather', 'over-blown', 'here.The', 'story', 'strong', 'homoerotic', 'overtones', 'quite', 'violent', 'adults', 'only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'interesting', 'finally', 'see.The', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', '80-minute', 'supplement', 'entitled', 'Marlowe', 'Inquest', 'excellent', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'three', 'barristers', 'who', 'subscribe', 'three', 'most', 'prominent', 'theories', 'Marlowe', 'death', 'ones', 'playing', 'Marlowe', 'contemporaries', 'Thomas', 'Kidd', 'example', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'Star', 'Chamber', 'investigation', 'contemporaries', 'Marlowe', 'are', 'period', 'costume', 'inquest', 'set', 'modern', 'times', '1980s', 'really', 'fine', 'production', 'far', 'better', 'anticipated', 'alone', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD.3-stars', 'Edward', 'II', '5-stars', 'Marlowe', 'Inquest']",Edward II

1234264,ABTUNH7645QJL,B001RUALEC,Peter Reeve,"[10, 13]","This is not a television adaptation, but a televised stage performance.  This production of Marlowe's play premiered at the Edinburgh International Festival in 1969 and toured for a few months in repertory with Richard II.  It was Ian McKellen's breakthrough performance and it featured the first kiss between two men on British television.Edward was said to be tall and well built, like his father, and something of an athlete.  McKellen is rather slight in stature and plays the early scenes in an effete manner.  So the transition to a warrior king bravely defending his realm is a difficult one for the actor to execute and the audience to credit, but McKellen proves (just) actor enough to do it.Historically, we cannot be sure whether Gaveston and Despenser ('Spencer' in the play) were actually Edward's lovers or simply close companions that he favored too much.  Most dramatic depictions have retained that ambiguity, but Marlowe goes all out for an openly homosexual interpretation and this production emphasizes that aspect.  Edward and his companions kiss each other full on the lips.The play is something of a sprint through the 20 years of Edward's reign.  Edward and some other characters age rapidly from one scene to the next, with little or no break between scenes.  These sudden continuity shifts will, I suspect, make some details of the plot confusing, if you are not familiar with the history itself.  But the central story - a king more interested in his male lovers than in pleasing his wife or running the country, thus making more enemies than he can handle - is clear and simple enough.The crucial thing, with Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, is to remain true to the language, to let the dialogue carry the play.  This production does that, magnificently.  This was the performance that made McKellen a star, and rightly so.Robert Eddison won an award for his performance of Lightborn.  He appears briefly but memorably, toward the end.There is a technical problem with the sound, in that the initial dialogue of characters entering from backstage is often lost.  Nonetheless, this is an essential production.[PeterReeve]",5,A theatrical (and gay) landmark,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2148,"['not', 'television', 'adaptation', 'televised', 'stage', 'performance', 'production', 'Marlowe', 'play', 'premiered', 'Edinburgh', 'International', 'Festival', '1969', 'toured', 'few', 'months', 'repertory', 'Richard', 'II', 'was', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'featured', 'first', 'kiss', 'two', 'men', 'British', 'television.Edward', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'tall', 'well', 'built', 'father', 'something', 'athlete', 'McKellen', 'rather', 'slight', 'stature', 'early', 'scenes', 'effete', 'manner', 'transition', 'warrior', 'king', 'bravely', 'defending', 'realm', 'difficult', 'one', 'actor', 'execute', 'audience', 'credit', 'McKellen', 'just', 'actor', 'enough', 'do', 'it.Historically', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'sure', 'Gaveston', 'Despenser', ""'Spencer"", 'play', 'were', 'actually', 'Edward', 'lovers', 'simply', 'close', 'companions', 'favored', 'too', 'much', 'Most', 'dramatic', 'depictions', 'have', 'retained', 'ambiguity', 'Marlowe', 'out', 'openly', 'homosexual', 'interpretation', 'production', 'aspect', 'Edward', 'companions', 'kiss', 'other', 'full', 'lips.The', 'play', 'something', 'sprint', '20', 'years', 'Edward', 'reign', 'Edward', 'other', 'characters', 'age', 'rapidly', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'little', 'break', 'scenes', 'sudden', 'continuity', 'shifts', 'will', 'suspect', 'make', 'details', 'plot', 'confusing', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'history', 'central', 'story', 'king', 'more', 'interested', 'male', 'lovers', 'pleasing', 'wife', 'running', 'country', 'thus', 'making', 'more', 'enemies', 'can', 'handle', 'clear', 'simple', 'enough.The', 'crucial', 'thing', 'Elizabethan', 'Jacobean', 'drama', 'remain', 'true', 'language', 'let', 'dialogue', 'carry', 'play', 'production', 'magnificently', 'was', 'performance', 'made', 'McKellen', 'star', 'rightly', 'so.Robert', 'Eddison', 'won', 'award', 'performance', 'Lightborn', 'briefly', 'memorably', 'end.There', 'technical', 'problem', 'sound', 'initial', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'entering', 'backstage', 'often', 'lost', 'Nonetheless', 'essential', 'production', '[', 'PeterReeve', ']']",Edward II
