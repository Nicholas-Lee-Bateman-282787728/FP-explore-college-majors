It is packed with all of my favorite Oasis songs and they sound no better than what this CD has to offer. I have been blown away by this DVD and have already worn out 2. The concert is a gift from Oasis to listeners who appreciate live music and it could not have been done better.

The documentary and interviews with the guys are a fantasic addition to an already excellent DVD.  Plus, the DVD features an innovative option that allows you to either watch something in the crowd or backstage as opposed to watching the band.  The music, interviews, and extra options make this DVD a must buy for any Oasis fan.",5,Great DVD,988243200,"04 26, 2001",2001,436,"['concert', 'alone', 'well', 'price', 'disc', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'what', 'DVD', 'special', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'guys', 'are', 'fantasic', 'addition', 'already', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'innovative', 'option', 'watch', 'something', 'crowd', 'backstage', 'opposed', 'watching', 'band', 'music', 'interviews', 'extra', 'options', 'make', 'DVD', 'must', 'buy', 'Oasis', 'fan']",N/A

I kept saying to myself just how *good* and crisp it looks. The colors were very well rendered and vibrant. Easily scores a 10 on video presentation.Audio left me a bit disappointed though. On the CD, I could make out the vocals with ease but the DVD had a lot more bass to it leaving the singing a bit muddled at times.Very nice use of the extras along with animated menus, very smooth and professional.My biggest complaint lies with the documentary. Very little of the band is shown and what we end up seeing are some of the most drunken... on the face of the earth...at least I hope they were because if that's how they act sober and mentally &quot;fit&quot; then I am truly frightened for the people of England. Rather embarassing to say the least. I understand Noel himself was less than complimentary about the fans shown. There were moments I literally had to look away from the screen, as I closed my eyes I thought &quot;These people are allowed in public????&quot;Regardless of the &quot;documentary&quot;, this is absolutely THE best looking concert DVD I have watched and I must say, well worth the wait!....",4,"Crisp, vibrant 'looking' DVD!",985910400,"03 30, 2001",2001,1259,"['Could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'finally', 'have', 'disc', 'hands', 'months', 'delays', 'picture', 'quality', 'disc', 'rather', 'stunning', 'kept', 'saying', 'myself', 'just', 'how', '*good*', 'crisp', 'colors', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'rendered', 'vibrant', 'Easily', '10', 'video', 'presentation.Audio', 'left', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'CD', 'could', 'make', 'out', 'vocals', 'ease', 'DVD', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'bass', 'leaving', 'singing', 'bit', 'muddled', 'times.Very', 'nice', 'use', 'extras', 'animated', 'menus', 'very', 'smooth', 'professional.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'documentary', 'Very', 'little', 'band', 'shown', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'seeing', 'are', 'most', 'drunken', 'face', 'earth', 'least', 'hope', 'were', 'because', 'how', 'act', 'sober', 'mentally', 'quot', 'fit', 'quot', 'then', 'am', 'truly', 'frightened', 'people', 'England', 'Rather', 'embarassing', 'say', 'least', 'understand', 'Noel', 'was', 'less', 'complimentary', 'fans', 'shown', 'were', 'moments', 'literally', 'had', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'closed', 'eyes', 'thought', 'quot', 'people', 'are', 'allowed', 'public', 'quot', 'Regardless', 'quot', 'documentary', 'quot', 'absolutely', 'THE', 'best', 'looking', 'concert', 'DVD', 'have', 'watched', 'must', 'say', 'well', 'wait']",N/A

Fun to watch the ever-confident Gallagher brothers interact with that massive crowd.  Camera coverage is superb and varied.  Sound quality is great.  Nice interactive menus, great bonus materials.

This tour was in support of the 'standing on the shoulder of giants' album which is my least favourite in the entire Oasis catalogue. But as far as sound and visuals go, I reckon this is a lot better. You actually feel like you are a part of the event that took place on the night of the 21st of july 2000. Hard to believe it was that long ago. I have seen Oasis live a few times and they are excellent live, so if you have never seen them in concert and would like too I highly recommend this as a substitute for now.The special features are outstanding and the accompanying interviews Liam and Noel actually make sense for a change, instead of their incoherent rambling from the past.The versions of 'stand by me' and 'don't look back in anger' are my standout tracks here. I look forward to the next live DVD release from Oasis.",4,Familiar to everyone,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,909,"['agree', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Then', 'only', 'songs', 'tour', 'was', 'support', ""'standing"", 'shoulder', 'giants', 'album', 'least', 'favourite', 'entire', 'Oasis', 'catalogue', 'as', 'far', 'sound', 'visuals', 'go', 'reckon', 'lot', 'better', 'actually', 'feel', 'are', 'part', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'night', '21st', 'july', '2000', 'Hard', 'believe', 'was', 'long', 'ago', 'have', 'seen', 'Oasis', 'live', 'few', 'times', 'are', 'excellent', 'live', 'so', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'concert', 'would', 'like', 'too', 'highly', 'recommend', 'substitute', 'now.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'outstanding', 'accompanying', 'interviews', 'Liam', 'Noel', 'actually', 'make', 'sense', 'change', 'instead', 'incoherent', 'rambling', 'past.The', 'versions', ""'stand"", ""'do"", ""n't"", 'look', 'back', 'anger', 'are', 'standout', 'tracks', 'here', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'live', 'DVD', 'release', 'Oasis']",N/A

He really is an underrated player. Liam's voice was great and didn't get overly whiny and stretched out the way I feel it went in the years following. If you can't see Oasis like this, the next best thing is Noel's shows which have a lot of stripped down versions of the songs, but it's great to look back on this video and see their best hits in front of such a huge audience. The camera angles are great and the sound quality is crisp.
