I have no problem with dark humor but a little irony would be helpful.  The acting, direction, and writing here are strictly amateur hour.  When the high point of a film is Susan Tyrrell's account of a depressive welfare mom then you are in trouble.  As for the aforementioned problems with the images breaking down at the film's midway point and then stopping altogether it's all true.  Don't waste your time or money on this DVD because it's not worth the aggravation.

I don't understand all the complaints here about the quality of the transfer.  Yes it's pan & scan, yes the print is on the faded side, and apparently it is missing a small scene, but there are no compression related issues and the dimmer colors tend to go along with the grindhouse feel of the picture.  I am grateful for a chance to see this on DVD so I say thank you to Cheezy Flicks for providing the only available version as of this writing.",4,"Get this from Cheezy Distribution, the quality is fine",1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,559,"['ordered', 'Cheezy', 'Distribution', 'Amazon', 'Marketplace', 'copy', 'was', 'factory-pressed', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'complaints', 'here', 'quality', 'transfer', 'Yes', 'pan', 'scan', 'yes', 'print', 'faded', 'side', 'apparently', 'missing', 'small', 'scene', 'are', 'compression', 'related', 'issues', 'dimmer', 'colors', 'tend', 'go', 'along', 'grindhouse', 'feel', 'picture', 'am', 'grateful', 'chance', 'see', 'DVD', 'say', 'thank', 'Cheezy', 'Flicks', 'providing', 'only', 'available', 'version', 'writing']",Andy Warhol's Bad VHS

545031,AB5MVBJGV1EV7,B00003GPFR,Queequeg,"[28, 30]","These DVDs are corrupted and do not play properly. I received the first defective DVD on Fri, 14 Jan 2005 and contacted the Seller. The Seller told me I needed to return the defective DVD before they would ship a replacement. I noticed on the Amazon merchant reviews that several people have had this same problem and I asked the Seller if they did indeed have copies which worked. They promised that they did have working DVDs and that they would ship one as soon as they received the defective DVD. Reluctantly I spent an additional $3 to ship the DVD back to the Seller. Today (Fri, 28 Jan 2005) I received the replacement DVD. This DVD is also defective with the identical manufacturing flaws. Evidentially Cheezy Flicks has no QC department to check their products. The DVD is quite obviously a bootleg/DVD-R copy of a worn out VHS tape. We play DVD-R's quite frequently on both our DVD systems, so it isn't a compatibility issue. The DVD will not load automatically when placed in the machine.  When inserted into the machine, the DVD freezes and the number ""9"" appears on the DVD player. After pressing Play many times, the menu eventually appears.  We were able to play the movie about 2/3 of the way through but there were constant pixilation and corruption problems all the way through.  Then around Chapter 10 the DVD stops completely. Also, none of the other options on the menu work. For example, pressing ""Other titles offered by Cheezy Flicks"" causes the DVD to stop. The DVD and the replacement were both defective. Wait for the legitimate release.

But, it is an Andy Warhol film and Joe Dallesandro is in it, as he has been in other Warhol films. Supposedly, another transfer to DVD is going to happen soon? Will wait and see. It is a comedy and the story is funny. But, the DVD is too sad to watch, (quality wise). A young Perry King also stars as well as Carroll Baker (""Baby Doll""). Hopefully, a restored DVD will soon be in the making.",1,BAD IS BAD,1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,464,"['terrible', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'world', 'either', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'film', 'Joe', 'Dallesandro', 'been', 'other', 'Warhol', 'films', 'Supposedly', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'going', 'happen', 'soon', 'Will', 'wait', 'see', 'comedy', 'story', 'funny', 'DVD', 'too', 'sad', 'watch', 'quality', 'wise', 'young', 'Perry', 'King', 'also', 'as', 'well', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'Hopefully', 'restored', 'DVD', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'making']",Andy Warhol's Bad VHS
