Walker ""geminiwalker""","[17, 39]","This is one of the most important movies of our time, and it was very difficult for me to get my hands on - in spite of the affordable price today. I had to wait a long time for it to come out on DVD.For those who have ever heard of the McMartin pre-school case and/or the movie ""Indictment"" based on same, this movie is also based on McMartin but not as if it were a hoax - which it was not. The preschool has another name, but the general facts of the case are all present. This movie was put out in 1989 and pretty much disappeared after that. I caught it once on the Lifetime channel and went looking all over the Internet for it, including the Lifetime channel itself. No dice.I'm thrilled to have it today. If this topic interests you at all, this is a movie to have in your collection.Indictment - The McMartin Trial",5,One of the most important movies of our time,1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,823,"['one', 'most', 'important', 'movies', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'get', 'hands', 'spite', 'affordable', 'price', 'today', 'had', 'wait', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'out', 'DVD.For', 'who', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'McMartin', 'pre-school', 'case', 'movie', 'Indictment', 'based', 'same', 'movie', 'also', 'based', 'McMartin', 'not', 'were', 'hoax', 'was', 'not', 'preschool', 'name', 'general', 'facts', 'case', 'are', 'present', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'out', '1989', 'pretty', 'much', 'disappeared', 'caught', 'once', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'went', 'looking', 'Internet', 'including', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'dice.I', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'have', 'today', 'topic', 'interests', 'movie', 'have', 'collection.Indictment', 'McMartin', 'Trial']",Do You Know the Muffin Man?
