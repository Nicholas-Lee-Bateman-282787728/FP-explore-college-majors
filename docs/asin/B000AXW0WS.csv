934029,A2NYLGHJ9RNKGK,B000AXW0WS,bmkd,"[5, 6]","I was really excited to receive this DVD, since I wanted to add another pregnancy workout DVD to mix things up. I am currently using ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" on a daily basis, which I love, but I'm starting to get a little bored doing the same thing every day.Here are my Pros and Cons with the ""Pilates During Pregancy"" workout:Pros:- The instructor was not the least bit annoying- The spoken instructions for each exercise were easy to follow- At 36 minutes, this workout is not too long or too short- Very little equipment is needed: a workout mat and three blanketsCons:- The lighting is very dark throughout the whole DVD, and the instructor is wearing dark, long pants, a dark, long-sleeve shirt, and does all the exercises on a dark workout mat. Do you see where I'm going with this? It's really hard to see what's going on. At times, you have to rely entirely on her spoken instructions, which thankfully are very good, to follow along.- The camera work is kind of off at times. For example, the camera shows the instructor's face, while she is explaining and doing a leg exercise, instead of showing her legs. That's kind of dumb.-  I don't know how the instructor does it, but I couldn't do half of the exercises the way she did them, because my growing belly was in the way (I'm 26 weeks).- The workout is brutal. I was able to somewhat struggle through the abdominal section, taking lots of breaks, but the side leg series was brutal. My hip hurt so bad, I had to stop doing the exercises. And it wasn't the good kind of hurt that you feel when you are getting a good workout. It was just plain pain. I almost couldn't get up from the floor because it hurt so much.- At times, during the abdominal section, my belly felt very uncomfortable. I even experienced some piercing pain in my stomach, which freaked me out a little.- Section II, the side leg series is actually 21 minutes long, not 30 minutes as stated.This DVD got a lot of positive reviews, so I figured I was going to like it a lot, but it just didn't work for me. I hope I can return it for a refund and try a different pregnancy pilates DVD. The ""10 Minute Solution Prenatal Pilates"" DVD looks good. Until then, I'll stick to ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" which always makes me feel great afterwards.",3,Brutal workout,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,2285,"['was', 'really', 'excited', 'receive', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'add', 'pregnancy', 'workout', 'DVD', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'am', 'currently', 'using', 'Perfect', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'daily', 'basis', 'love', ""'m"", 'starting', 'get', 'little', 'bored', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'day.Here', 'are', 'Pros', 'Cons', 'Pilates', 'Pregancy', 'workout', 'Pros', 'instructor', 'was', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'annoying-', 'spoken', 'instructions', 'exercise', 'were', 'easy', 'follow-', '36', 'minutes', 'workout', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'short-', 'Very', 'little', 'equipment', 'needed', 'workout', 'mat', 'three', 'blanketsCons', 'lighting', 'very', 'dark', 'whole', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'wearing', 'dark', 'long', 'pants', 'dark', 'long-sleeve', 'shirt', 'exercises', 'dark', 'workout', 'mat', 'Do', 'see', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'really', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'times', 'have', 'rely', 'entirely', 'spoken', 'instructions', 'thankfully', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'follow', 'along.-', 'camera', 'work', 'kind', 'off', 'times', 'example', 'camera', 'instructor', 'face', 'explaining', 'doing', 'leg', 'exercise', 'instead', 'showing', 'legs', 'kind', 'dumb.-', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'instructor', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'half', 'exercises', 'way', 'did', 'growing', 'belly', 'was', 'way', ""'m"", '26', 'weeks', '.-', 'workout', 'brutal', 'was', 'able', 'somewhat', 'struggle', 'abdominal', 'section', 'taking', 'lots', 'breaks', 'side', 'leg', 'series', 'was', 'brutal', 'hip', 'hurt', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'stop', 'doing', 'exercises', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'kind', 'hurt', 'feel', 'when', 'are', 'getting', 'good', 'workout', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'pain', 'almost', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'floor', 'hurt', 'so', 'much.-', 'times', 'abdominal', 'section', 'belly', 'felt', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'even', 'experienced', 'piercing', 'pain', 'stomach', 'freaked', 'out', 'little.-', 'Section', 'II', 'side', 'leg', 'series', 'actually', '21', 'minutes', 'long', 'not', '30', 'minutes', 'stated.This', 'DVD', 'got', 'lot', 'positive', 'reviews', 'figured', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'lot', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'hope', 'can', 'return', 'refund', 'try', 'different', 'pregnancy', 'pilates', 'DVD', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'Prenatal', 'Pilates', 'DVD', 'good', 'then', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'Perfect', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'always', 'feel', 'great', 'afterwards']","Pilates During Pregnancy, Vol. 1"

934031,A3JQQ00GA32YOL,B000AXW0WS,Jennifer T. Garces,"[7, 7]","I ordered this dvd with high hopes as I am in the second trimester of my second pregnancy and have been working out almost daily throughout.  I consider myself an intermediate to advanced and found this dvd to be a great challenge!  I've done some seriously tough Pilates dvd's in my life and this was definitely a challenging workout.  My workout buddy (who is not pregnant) was feeling it just as much as I was by the end.  We are putting this in our weekly rotation!For those who have left negative reviews - they were probably NOT in that great of shape before starting this DVD and probably not that familiar with Pilates if they required a lot of instruction in order to complete the series.  This is not for a true beginner, I agree, but it's not SO difficult that you can't figure it out after a few tries.  All of the moves I've done before in one way or the other, I think what makes this a 'pregnancy' DVD is the order in which they are done and the small modifications being made for the beginning when you are on your back.  (Side note to the one-star reviewer that states she was horrified she was being told to come to a seated position from lying flat on her back obviously did NOT watch this DVD - Niece is propped up by three blankets and is therefore performing 'assisted' situps!!) For the reviewers bemoaning the lack of stretching prior to working out - uhm, Pilates IS STRETCHING.Anyway, if you are relatively fit and active and know how to not injure yourself doing some stretches and continuous Pilates moves, then this DVD is for you!  I am using this along with the Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa DVD in addition to the Tae Bo PT 24/7 program.",5,Don't believe the negative reviews!,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,1673,"['ordered', 'dvd', 'high', 'hopes', 'am', 'second', 'trimester', 'second', 'pregnancy', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'almost', 'daily', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'found', 'dvd', 'be', 'great', 'challenge', ""'ve"", 'done', 'seriously', 'tough', 'Pilates', 'dvd', 'life', 'was', 'definitely', 'challenging', 'workout', 'workout', 'buddy', 'who', 'not', 'pregnant', 'was', 'feeling', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'end', 'are', 'putting', 'weekly', 'rotation', 'who', 'have', 'left', 'negative', 'reviews', 'were', 'probably', 'NOT', 'great', 'shape', 'starting', 'DVD', 'probably', 'not', 'familiar', 'Pilates', 'required', 'lot', 'instruction', 'order', 'complete', 'series', 'not', 'true', 'beginner', 'agree', 'not', 'SO', 'difficult', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'few', 'tries', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'done', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'think', 'what', ""'pregnancy"", 'DVD', 'order', 'are', 'done', 'small', 'modifications', 'being', 'made', 'beginning', 'when', 'are', 'back', 'Side', 'note', 'one-star', 'reviewer', 'was', 'horrified', 'was', 'being', 'told', 'come', 'seated', 'position', 'lying', 'flat', 'back', 'obviously', 'did', 'NOT', 'watch', 'DVD', 'Niece', 'propped', 'up', 'three', 'blankets', 'therefore', 'performing', ""'assisted"", 'situps', 'reviewers', 'bemoaning', 'lack', 'stretching', 'prior', 'working', 'out', 'uhm', 'Pilates', 'IS', 'STRETCHING.Anyway', 'are', 'relatively', 'fit', 'active', 'know', 'how', 'not', 'injure', 'doing', 'stretches', 'continuous', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'then', 'DVD', 'am', 'using', 'Jennifer', 'Wolfe', 'Prenatal', 'Vinyasa', 'DVD', 'addition', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'PT', '24/7', 'program']","Pilates During Pregnancy, Vol. 1"

Johnson""","[0, 0]","I did Pilates a few years back when I was in much better shape, and at that time didn't find Pilates very difficult or painful. Since then I've lost a lot of muscle, and my early pregnancy sickness didn't help. This workout was more difficult for me than expected, I did feel a burn, and I know my form was lacking. However, the length is very good, and because it wasn't as ""easy"" for me as expected, I look forward to doing it again and again until I can tell my fitness level and form has improved. It's not my favorite workout, but I do plan to keep it in my rotation, it was definately working parts of my lower body that aren't being hit by other workouts.

934033,A2NMVCFMC8F1DW,B000AXW0WS,MelissaLynn,"[0, 1]",This is the only prenatal workout I have tried so far that isn't a complete snooze fest.  This workout is actually challenging.  I was an advanced exerciser prior to pregnancy (now 21 weeks along) but have begun to struggle in my workouts in the past few weeks.  Since adding this to my rotation I have noticed added definition in my butt and thighs.  It is definitely hard but will not wipe you out.  My butt and legs are ON FIRE during the side-lying series (which I LOVE).  It does get easier with repeated use.

There are no long introductions you can't fast-forward through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal and breath series and the side series (which is all legs and hips) are really challenging and I plan on doing them to keep my muscles toned even after delivery.

This is an outstanding workout, and will tone your core and legs like nothing else!The video is divided into two sections--a 15 minute abs section and a 25 minute legs/side lying series section.  It is no-nonsense, and Niece is visibly pregnant while doing everything (apparently effortlessly) and guiding you through it.  It's well-cued, and everything essential to doing Pilates correctly is covered.  You can do this throughout your entire pregnancy.The toning for your hips, butt, and thighs cannot be overemphasized.  My legs look great, even though I'm 7 months pregnant.  And you definitely feel you've done a workout--your butt muscle will feel like it's about to fall off during the side-lying series.  I recommend you keep the remote close by so you can pause it and stretch for a longer period of time than what she does after you finish each side during that series, because you will be feeling the burn!Bottom line:  this is a great, safe, workout for pregnancy--with no fakey cheerleading, just solid exercise.
