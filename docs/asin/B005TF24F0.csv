Teslovich,"[1, 1]","Hunter-prey movies e.g. ""Surviving the Game"", ""Hard Target"", ""Deadly Prey"" are plentiful and this one had potential given that the surprising source of who were the hunters and a really nice horrific setting. But it lagged in too many areas to be really good.First, too many missing bodies, in too small of an area, over too long of a period of time to be taken seriously.Second, that the police chief and several upstanding community members should be participating in the crimes was unbelievable.Third, that nobody discovered the rooms of displayed heads and torture devices at a frequently visited tourist destination historical fort - nahhh, not likely.Fourth, that our hero combat, ex-soldier, now police officer, made too many dumb decisions and when he finds himself holding and firing a weapon he acts like he was afraid of it. Then, with his seemingly unlimited supply of ammo (where it came from - who knows), he completely missed his very close targets despite being just yards away.Fifth, all the improbable scenes where assailants die from their own stupid mistakes.Sixth, really bad editing making the movie seem like a patchwork of scenes tossed together to quickly finish the movie. One example is the pointless ending with the hero sitting in a cafe sipping coffee while the only other survivor just happens to be sitting at a booth in the same cafe staring out the window (probably wondering why her boyfriend was blasted with a shotgun right in front of her) before she orders her tea.",2,Some Suspense & Some Acting,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,1504,"['Hunter-prey', 'movies', 'e.g', 'Surviving', 'Game', 'Hard', 'Target', 'Deadly', 'Prey', 'are', 'plentiful', 'one', 'had', 'potential', 'given', 'surprising', 'source', 'who', 'were', 'hunters', 'really', 'nice', 'horrific', 'setting', 'lagged', 'too', 'many', 'areas', 'be', 'really', 'good.First', 'too', 'many', 'missing', 'bodies', 'too', 'small', 'area', 'too', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.Second', 'police', 'chief', 'several', 'upstanding', 'community', 'members', 'should', 'be', 'participating', 'crimes', 'was', 'unbelievable.Third', 'nobody', 'discovered', 'rooms', 'displayed', 'heads', 'torture', 'devices', 'frequently', 'visited', 'tourist', 'destination', 'historical', 'fort', 'nahhh', 'not', 'likely.Fourth', 'hero', 'combat', 'ex-soldier', 'now', 'police', 'officer', 'made', 'too', 'many', 'dumb', 'decisions', 'when', 'holding', 'firing', 'weapon', 'was', 'afraid', 'Then', 'seemingly', 'unlimited', 'supply', 'ammo', 'where', 'came', 'who', 'completely', 'missed', 'very', 'close', 'targets', 'being', 'just', 'yards', 'away.Fifth', 'improbable', 'scenes', 'where', 'assailants', 'die', 'own', 'stupid', 'mistakes.Sixth', 'really', 'bad', 'editing', 'making', 'movie', 'seem', 'patchwork', 'scenes', 'tossed', 'together', 'quickly', 'finish', 'movie', 'One', 'example', 'pointless', 'ending', 'hero', 'sitting', 'cafe', 'sipping', 'coffee', 'only', 'other', 'survivor', 'just', 'be', 'sitting', 'booth', 'same', 'cafe', 'staring', 'out', 'window', 'probably', 'wondering', 'why', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'blasted', 'shotgun', 'right', 'front', 'orders', 'tea']",The Hunters

1503271,A3559I6Q7RCPP3,B005TF24F0,"Robert Cossaboon ""devil doll""","[1, 1]","To agree with many of the reviewers, Hunters was, or could have been, a decent little nasty take on that famous story, The Most Dangerous Game.  Too bad it takes almost 40 minutes to get to the meaty part of the story.  Basically, you should forward the DVD to the part where the police officer is meeting his informant at the fort.  Until then you will be assaulted with all manner of back stories, flashbacks, flashforwards and flash who-the-hell-knows-where-this-is-heading-to's.  Once the ""hunting"" starts, the film picks up very quickly.  This doesn't mean the film or the story redeems itself by a long shot.  There were lots of unanswered questions.  The motivations of the hunters are never entirely clear.  Surely not for depravity alone?  Yes, there is Diana Agron (of Glee and I Am Number Four), but it's strictly now you see her, now you don't.  Apparently her face on the DVD cover is for the sole purpose of selling the film.  She's hardly in the film, and the times she is on screen are strictly wooden.

1503274,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B005TF24F0,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","Picture the scene a disused castle that is run by an elite club of men who like shooting off in the woods (I did that once). Throw into the mix some rubbish cops who have spent too long learning `The Cop Book Of Unamusing Clich&eacute;s' and some `kids' who just wanna have fun. This then is the heady mix of (not so) groundbreaking scenarios that our hero is thrown into.He is a cop, but wants to break the mould by taking on his ball breaking, no messin boss. This is a boss who knows he is winning because he can shout really loud. Our hero is also an ex marine - with a past - that will add to the nightmarish (not) situations he will be thrust into when a meeting with a stool pigeon leads him to be locked into the scary castle Goben's grounds.Meantime there is another story of the three men who are the sort of gun totin guardians, they are all nice in real life doing jobs where they are underappreciated and oft times abused, like in a modern take of a Dickens character. One is a bar tender, one an IT guy and the other a school teacher, so at weekends they let their hair down by doin' stuff in the woods.The hero cop is called Le saint and is played by Chris Briant who also directed this woeful waste of celluloid. We have phrases like `don't stray from the path' (bad guys to Le saint) and `you can't know suffering if you haven't experienced happiness' well the makers taught me a few things about suffering.We have magic guns that never run out of bullets, motives left unexplained or even hinted at. Bad casting but Jay Brown as Steve and Steven Waddington as his mate Ronny both do above average jobs of raising this from the mire (hence the rating). It is badly edited and the plot is disjointed, what twists there are have better signposting than Disneyland - truly tragic. Eerie dream sequences and nightmares that are also a bit rubbish, some man on man action that is just inserted (forgive the pun) and then some vague references to the guardians being actual Vikings and I don't think they meant metaphorically.Good points are the great locations, the cinematography and some of the acting, the music too does a great job of trying to get the mood across. There are plot holes but heck I assumed you would have guessed that. There probably is a good film in here trying to get out, but the wrong one got made. You will only want to see this if you have to have every film that calls itself horror and trust me a room full of school kids is more scary, or you are a friend of Mr Briant - not one from acting school as he has never been. Seriously duff film that has a smorgasbord of clich&eacute;s wrapped up in a bilious attack of bad film making, only buy if you want to give it to as a gift to someone you want to remove from your Christmas card list.",2,"Scary Castle, Men with Guns Nave Kids and Shoddy Cops!",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,2779,"['Picture', 'scene', 'disused', 'castle', 'run', 'elite', 'club', 'men', 'who', 'shooting', 'off', 'woods', 'did', 'once', 'Throw', 'mix', 'rubbish', 'cops', 'who', 'have', 'spent', 'too', 'long', 'learning', 'Cop', 'Book', 'Unamusing', 'Clich', 'eacute', 'kids', 'who', 'just', 'wan', 'na', 'have', 'fun', 'then', 'heady', 'mix', 'not', 'so', 'groundbreaking', 'scenarios', 'hero', 'thrown', 'into.He', 'cop', 'break', 'mould', 'taking', 'ball', 'breaking', 'messin', 'boss', 'boss', 'who', 'winning', 'can', 'shout', 'really', 'loud', 'hero', 'also', 'ex', 'marine', 'past', 'will', 'add', 'nightmarish', 'not', 'situations', 'will', 'be', 'thrust', 'when', 'meeting', 'stool', 'pigeon', 'be', 'locked', 'scary', 'castle', 'Goben', 'grounds.Meantime', 'story', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'sort', 'gun', 'totin', 'guardians', 'are', 'nice', 'real', 'life', 'doing', 'jobs', 'where', 'are', 'underappreciated', 'oft', 'times', 'abused', 'modern', 'take', 'Dickens', 'character', 'One', 'bar', 'tender', 'one', 'IT', 'guy', 'other', 'school', 'teacher', 'so', 'weekends', 'let', 'hair', 'down', 'doin', 'stuff', 'woods.The', 'hero', 'cop', 'called', 'Le', 'saint', 'played', 'Chris', 'Briant', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'woeful', 'waste', 'celluloid', 'have', 'phrases', 'do', ""n't"", 'stray', 'path', 'bad', 'guys', 'Le', 'saint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'suffering', 'have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'happiness', 'well', 'makers', 'taught', 'few', 'things', 'suffering.We', 'have', 'magic', 'guns', 'never', 'run', 'out', 'bullets', 'motives', 'left', 'unexplained', 'even', 'hinted', 'Bad', 'casting', 'Jay', 'Brown', 'Steve', 'Steven', 'Waddington', 'mate', 'Ronny', 'do', 'average', 'jobs', 'raising', 'mire', 'hence', 'rating', 'badly', 'edited', 'plot', 'disjointed', 'what', 'are', 'have', 'better', 'signposting', 'Disneyland', 'truly', 'tragic', 'Eerie', 'dream', 'sequences', 'nightmares', 'are', 'also', 'bit', 'rubbish', 'man', 'man', 'action', 'just', 'inserted', 'forgive', 'pun', 'then', 'vague', 'references', 'guardians', 'being', 'actual', 'Vikings', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'meant', 'metaphorically.Good', 'points', 'are', 'great', 'locations', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'music', 'too', 'great', 'job', 'trying', 'get', 'mood', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'heck', 'assumed', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'probably', 'good', 'film', 'here', 'trying', 'get', 'out', 'wrong', 'one', 'got', 'made', 'will', 'only', 'want', 'see', 'have', 'have', 'film', 'horror', 'trust', 'room', 'full', 'school', 'kids', 'more', 'scary', 'are', 'friend', 'Mr', 'Briant', 'not', 'one', 'acting', 'school', 'never', 'been', 'Seriously', 'duff', 'film', 'smorgasbord', 'clich', 'eacute', 'wrapped', 'up', 'bilious', 'attack', 'bad', 'film', 'making', 'only', 'buy', 'want', 'give', 'gift', 'someone', 'want', 'remove', 'Christmas', 'card', 'list']",The Hunters
