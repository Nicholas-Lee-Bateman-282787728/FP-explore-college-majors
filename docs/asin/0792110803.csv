124638,A24PTVSZSM8968,0792110803,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","I remember watching this series on television when I was much younger. It made a great impression on me and I had wanted to re-watch it again for many years. Obviously production techniques have improved much over the years and in some ways the effects seem quaint by today's standards. However, the story itself holds up very well. The memorable aspect of this series is how it gives the feel for what it was like to actually experience the events and witness what was happening at the time. Everyone knows all of the famous stories and the outcome of World War II now, but at the time, many things were in doubt and nobody really knew what to expect. This comes through very clearly in the series. In spite of the length and the fact that this series only covers events up through 1941, much has to be skipped and there are some considerable jumps chronologically. However, at the same time, that way the story is written, one or more of the main characters ends up witnessing most of the famous and critical events of the period. As such, you end up feeling like you have seen the complete story.The acting is generally very good, the stories are interesting and engaging and the characters are likable in most cases. However, I would say that the weakest part of the story is the first episode. Some of the characters seem a bit wooden at first and only come into their own as the story progresses. By about the second half of the first episode they seem to hit their stride and you feel very comfortable with them. By the end, you hate to see the series finish and desperately want to see more. Fortunately, the second half awaits in War and Remembrance.I highly recommend this series to anyone who has not seen it. There are certainly more intense war movies now with better effects that deal with individual battles or events, but to my knowledge, there is nothing that gives the big picture ""what it was like to be there"" feel for those who witnessed the gathering winds of war at the time better than this series. It was an amazing accomplishment for this series to be made in 1983 and it is still relevant today even though historical opinion about some events may have evolved since then.",5,Very memorable,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,2199,"['remember', 'watching', 'series', 'television', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'younger', 'made', 'great', 'impression', 'had', 'wanted', 're-watch', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'Obviously', 'production', 'techniques', 'have', 'improved', 'much', 'years', 'ways', 'effects', 'seem', 'quaint', 'today', 'standards', 'However', 'story', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'memorable', 'aspect', 'series', 'how', 'feel', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'experience', 'events', 'witness', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'time', 'Everyone', 'famous', 'stories', 'outcome', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'now', 'time', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'doubt', 'nobody', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'through', 'very', 'clearly', 'series', 'spite', 'length', 'fact', 'series', 'only', 'events', 'up', '1941', 'much', 'be', 'skipped', 'are', 'considerable', 'jumps', 'chronologically', 'However', 'same', 'time', 'way', 'story', 'written', 'one', 'more', 'main', 'characters', 'up', 'witnessing', 'most', 'famous', 'critical', 'events', 'period', 'such', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'have', 'seen', 'complete', 'story.The', 'acting', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'most', 'cases', 'However', 'would', 'say', 'weakest', 'part', 'story', 'first', 'episode', 'characters', 'seem', 'bit', 'wooden', 'first', 'only', 'come', 'own', 'story', 'second', 'half', 'first', 'episode', 'seem', 'hit', 'stride', 'feel', 'very', 'comfortable', 'end', 'hate', 'see', 'series', 'finish', 'desperately', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'Fortunately', 'second', 'half', 'awaits', 'War', 'Remembrance.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'are', 'certainly', 'more', 'intense', 'war', 'movies', 'now', 'better', 'effects', 'deal', 'individual', 'battles', 'events', 'knowledge', 'nothing', 'big', 'picture', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'there', 'feel', 'who', 'witnessed', 'gathering', 'winds', 'war', 'time', 'better', 'series', 'was', 'amazing', 'accomplishment', 'series', 'be', 'made', '1983', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'even', 'historical', 'opinion', 'events', 'may', 'have', 'evolved', 'then']",N/A
124639,A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E,0792110803,"Archie Mercer ""Archie""","[119, 123]","I first read The Winds of War by Herman Wouk back around 1972. The book just absolutely grabbed me. When I heard that ABC was filming a mini-series I was a little skeptical. Very few &quot;made for TV&quot; movies from  books really capture the true feel of the original work. THIS ONE DOES!  First of all it has a great cast. Robert Mitchum was just awsome as  Comander Pug Henry. Both Jan Michael Vincent and Ali McGraw were credable  as older actors playing young adults. Polly Bergen, John Houseman, and  Peter Graves round out an exceptional cast. The fictional account of a  family caught up within historical events continues to draw my attention,  even though I have watch this many times since it originally came out. Some  of the many highlights include the special effects of the bombing of  London, the Japanesse attack on Pearl Harbor, and the wonderful re-creation  of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Hitler by Ralph Bellamy and crew. In comparing  this series to War and Remembrance, which was the sequal in both book and  mini-series, I would have to give the nod to this as the better. If you're  looking for an accurate and riviting account of the early years of WW II,  then grab this up.

Despite the age differences Ali McGraw and Jan-Michael Vincent were absolutely perfect as the independent and fickle Natali Jastrow and the bull-headed Byron Henry.

Recently I purchased the DVD and was shocked at how bad it was. The 3 main problems are Ali McGraw, Jan-Michael Vincent, and Robert Mitchum. The common thread? Age. Nathalie and Byron in the book are approx 28 and 24. McGraw was 45 at the time of the filming and Vincent 39. In the book Pug is probably 55 and in this series, Mitchum is a very old-looking 66. They simply look ridiculous. Other reviewers have focused on the insanely stupid subplot of Nathalie and her uncle and they are 100% correct. It was not great in the book, but on the screen it is simply unbelievable.Finally there is the acting. I am a big fan of Mitchum but he sleep walked through this one. Polly Bergen is ridiculously over the top.Ben Murphy and Jan-Michael Vincent are awful. But the prize goes to McGraw. I had never realized how little talent she had until I watched this series.

124646,A2WLZD9BY669HY,0792110803,Candace Scott,"[20, 22]","Despite staggering flaws in the casting of this epic drama, Robert Mitchum saves the day and dominates this brilliant series. Anyone who has read Herman Wouk's book probably cringed when picturing Mitchum as the short, 50-ish Pug Henry and he is physically all wrong for the part. But you don't care once he sleepily walks onto the screen and gives one of the most understated and &quot;I don't give a damn&quot; performances of his career. Is Mitchum too old for the part? You bet. Could he have shown a bit more emotion, especially in the love seens? Undoubtedly. Does it compromise the series or detract? Absolutely not.The problems with this drama emanate from the other cast members. Ali McGraw as Natalie delivers one of the most wretchedly acted performances in all of TV history. Her over-acting, melodramatic pauses and pacing of her lines is simply atrocious. It's impossible not to laugh uproariously at her silly attempts to project human emotion in any form. Jan-Michael Vincent is similarly bad and completely outclassed by everyone else in the production (except the insipid Ali McGraw). Their scenes together are well-written but spoiled by two actors who should have pursued a different profession.John Houseman and Polly Bergen are outstanding in their roles. Watch Houseman, a brilliant actor, in his scenes with wither Vicent or McGraw. You will cringe when you see his majestry and their weak, vain attempts to try and act on the same stage with this master! One does wish, however, that Aaron Jastrow and the endless wrangling with his passport would end. They draw this plot line out to insufferably long duration.The best parts of the mini-series are undoubtedly the romance between Mitchum and Pamela Tudsbury. Even though their chemistry seems strained, what woman wouldn't pursue Robert Mitchum across the globe and back, even when he is pushing 70? Buy me a ticket.For anyone who loves World War II and a classy production, this is your baby. I've watched it a dozen times and never weary of it.

124647,A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,0792110803,Caraculiambro,"[17, 46]","There are seven tapes in this series, all lasting about two hours (the last one a little more).  We are told the story of the Henry family in the days before WWII, through the beginning of that conflict, and up until just after the attack on Pearl Harbor (shortly after which the series closes).  Although there are some good scenes and elements, I would characterize this on the whole as an unrewarding 14-hour slog that will try the patience of even the most ardent WWII-movie buffs.  Why?1.  The chief focus of the plot is on the soap-operatic elements of their characters' lives; never anything deeper.  It seems that there is only one member of the Henry family who's not involved in some sort of love triangle or other.  Criminally, these triangles are  wholly uninteresting and left unresolved at the end of the series!  And as if that isn't bad enough, the principal actors seem a little old to be engaging in such unprincipled philandering (e.g., the sprightly Ali McGraw turned 44 during filming).2.  On the whole, the characters are flat and uninteresting, even stereotyped.  A possible exception to this could have been the pre-submarine Byron, who apparently slacked a rebellious swath across Europe despite a promising mind and family connections.  Why?  What was his personal philosophy?  What was he thinking?  But this was never explored.3.  Mitchum is a totally one-note actor with zero depth, at least here.  He reassures Victoria Tennet of his passion in the same flat tone he uses to apprise the president of the German threat.  We admire his character, sure, but that's not enough to carry us through 14 hours of him!4.  The movie's device of following the Pug character through the various theaters of war (the better to grasp the immensity of the thing) worked well in the beginning, but it soon became strained and gimmicky.  The next thing we were expecting was a personal interview with Hideki Tojo during which it would be revealed that Pug speaks (surprise, surprise) - halting Japanese!  Having him go to every theater of war was certainly stretching things a bit.5.  When subtitles are given, they are printed in white, which frequently makes them illegible.6.  Aaron Jastrow's passport woes form just about the worst sub-plot I've ever encountered.  It's so boring, it's infuriating.  I mean, it goes on and on for several episodes.  In the end you just wanna smack Natalie and that airheaded Jastrow for not getting out when the getting was good, and it's not like they didn't have several warnings and opportunities!  Personally, I found Natalie's stubbornness and mindless shuffling back and forth to and from Europe highly irritating, yet Dan Curtis seems to imply that her uncle not getting his transit visa through Zurich is more worthy of our tears than hundreds of thousands of deaths occurring that moment on the eastern front!  To top it off, at the end of the series, the whole passport issue is left maddeningly unresolved.  They board ship for Turkey, which is a long way from the States.  And we don't even get to see the ship leave.  So did they get home safe or not?  And now that I mention it, we never learn if Jastrow's precious MS was ever recovered from the hotel, either!7.  Apparently ""World War II"" wouldn't look like ""World War II"" unless we smeared a gallon of Vaseline on the lens throughout the entire film, even during the non-romantic scenes.  Was this really necessary?8.  None of the major characters die, or even get shot.  (Although Pug's other son does receive some facial scratches when he is ""shot down"".)9.  The Pearl Harbor scene.  It was a disaster, right?  Yet this movie seems to imply it was a stirring victory merely because Byron Henry managed to transfer 26 torpedoes out of a doomed warehouse.  And God forbid one shows up for Pearl Harbor without a babe in tow!  (Apparently the producers felt that every single scene had to have a woman involved or they would lose their distaff viewers.)For all this silliness, the movie does have its strong points, I'll be the first to admit.  For example, although the characters themselves aren't very interesting, the predicaments they're put into on occasion result in some very well-done scenes (in particular Natalie and Byron in Poland, and ""Pug"" in the bombing run over Germany).  But the special effects budget was not tremendous, so the movie's at its best when it's exploring the emotional lives of ordinary people thrust into extraordinary situations.Also, the portrayals of Roosevelt and Hitler stand out as especially convincing.

Now that I have seen the series, I am very much interested in reading the book.  In particular, there must be very rich character development and plot lines.  Not to mention more historical detail, which I have heard is a very strong point of the book.As I said, I thought the series was great.  The locations were gorgeous, and kudos to props.  There are some acting diamonds and, unfortunately, lumps of coal.  Some have called Mitchum's performance ""tired"" but I thought he was magnificent.  As the central character in the story, the role was a huge challenge.  I felt that Mitchum did the character of Pug Henry much justice.  Who cares that Mitchum is substantially older than the Henry character.  Criticism of that sort is useless to me.  Bellamy was good in the FDR role.  Very difficult role to play so I thought he was quite believeable.  Dukes was very solid as Slote.  The real gem of the series, in my opinion, was Victoria Tennant.  I found myself mesmerized whenever she was on the screen.  I also, enjoyed the chemistry between the Pamela and Victor characters, although Tennant did make it seem a bit unidirectional at times.  Granted the Victor Henry character was meant to have more reserve due to his life circumstances, but one can demonstrate intense chemistry despite the reserve.  That being said, of all the relationships explored in the series, the Pamela/Pug relationship was the most interesting and enjoyable to me.  I will say it again, Tennant was fabulous and absolutely captivating.Now that I have described the peak of the series, I have do address the trough...Ali McGraw.  Wow.  What a bummer that was to watch.  Everytime the Natalie character was on screen I immediately lost interest and wanted to forward through the segment.  I have no idea what was going on with that performance. I have never thought of McGraw as a bad actress per se.  In this portrayal, though, she was very disappointing and even annoying at times.Overall, though, I liked the series and am looking forward to War and Remembrance",4,Enjoyable...Casting Issues Though,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,2179,"['thorougly', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'Having', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'offer', 'comments', 'terms', 'translation', 'text', 'screen', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'interested', 'reading', 'book', 'particular', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'lines', 'Not', 'mention', 'more', 'historical', 'detail', 'have', 'heard', 'very', 'strong', 'point', 'book.As', 'said', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'locations', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'kudos', 'props', 'are', 'acting', 'diamonds', 'unfortunately', 'lumps', 'coal', 'have', 'called', 'Mitchum', 'performance', 'tired', 'thought', 'was', 'magnificent', 'central', 'character', 'story', 'role', 'was', 'huge', 'challenge', 'felt', 'Mitchum', 'did', 'character', 'Pug', 'Henry', 'much', 'justice', 'Who', 'Mitchum', 'substantially', 'older', 'Henry', 'character', 'Criticism', 'sort', 'useless', 'Bellamy', 'was', 'good', 'FDR', 'role', 'Very', 'difficult', 'role', 'play', 'so', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'believeable', 'Dukes', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'Slote', 'real', 'gem', 'series', 'opinion', 'was', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'found', 'mesmerized', 'whenever', 'was', 'screen', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'chemistry', 'Pamela', 'Victor', 'characters', 'Tennant', 'did', 'make', 'seem', 'bit', 'unidirectional', 'times', 'Granted', 'Victor', 'Henry', 'character', 'was', 'meant', 'have', 'more', 'reserve', 'due', 'life', 'circumstances', 'one', 'can', 'demonstrate', 'intense', 'chemistry', 'reserve', 'being', 'said', 'relationships', 'explored', 'series', 'Pamela/Pug', 'relationship', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'will', 'say', 'again', 'Tennant', 'was', 'fabulous', 'absolutely', 'captivating.Now', 'have', 'described', 'peak', 'series', 'have', 'do', 'address', 'trough', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'Wow', 'What', 'bummer', 'was', 'watch', 'Everytime', 'Natalie', 'character', 'was', 'screen', 'immediately', 'lost', 'interest', 'wanted', 'forward', 'segment', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'performance', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'McGraw', 'bad', 'actress', 'se', 'portrayal', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'even', 'annoying', 'times.Overall', 'liked', 'series', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'War', 'Remembrance']",N/A

Mathieu ""waldenpond88""","[2, 4]","I just spent an hour with reading all reader's reviews and agree with most of them, enjoyed reading the one by the history professor from Zagreb the most!However I totally disagree with the reader's review from Tracy Marks on 9/14/2006. I did read the Wouk books before I watched the mini series and always felt that there was no better cast choice for the part of Natalie Jastrow than Ali MacGraw. I've seen ""Love Story"" and found it quite nice, but when I watched ""Winds of War"", I was completely taken with the undeniable chemistry between Ali MacGraw and Jan-Michael Vincent and their good acting. If they were only acting that they were in love, then these were the most convincing love scenes I ever saw on the big screen or on TV in more than 40 years.How big was my disappointment when I started watching the sequel ""War and Remembrance"" and had to accept that Dan Curtis (or his casting agency) had replaced the vivid and passionate Ali MacGraw by sleeping pill actress Jane Seymour (I was already wondering way back in the early seventies when I watched the James Bond movie ""Live and let Die"" how Seymour got that part???).The actor who replaced Jan-Michael Vincent as Byron Henry was not bad, but he was simply lacking Vincent's charisma. Vincent might not be the world's greatest actor, but he certainly has sex appeal and charisma. So has MacGraw.At first I watched the whole series, all 19 parts. When I watched it a second time about 2 years later, I fast-forwarded the Seymour scenes (they are unbearable to watch) and focussed on the remaining good actors like Mitchum, Tennant and a few others.Lately I only watched the first 7 parts.I once did read somewhere that Ali MacGraw did not get the part offered again in ""War and Remembrance"", because she was considered being too old. I had no clue that she was over 40 when she played 28 year old Natalie Jastrow. She looked and acted like late twenties to me. She WAS Natalie Jastrow. If Curtis would not have waited 5 years, before he started filming the sequel, she would have been 5 years younger and as perfect as in the first part of this mini series. I think even 5 years later she would have been perfect still. In any case hundred times better than the sleeping pill :).

Epic in scope and yet intimate at the same time, it draws you into the world of pre-war Europe and the lives of the Henry family.

Almost every actor in this production is perfectly cast, most notably Polly Bergen as Rhoda Henry, David Dukes as Leslie Slote, and Victoria Tennant as Pamela Tudsbury. Robert Mitchum, Ali MacGraw and John Houseman are also terrific. The only shortcoming in the cast is Jan-Michael Vincent as Byron Henry; his acting skills just weren't quite at the level of the rest of the cast, and so he ends up seeming a little flat at times (especially in scenes with Ali MacGraw).At 18 hours, this is quite a long show, but I found myself not wanting it to end.

124677,A38XOBYNKF9OZB,0792110803,James Luckard,"[124, 127]","Paramount deserves major congratulations for doing right by The Winds of War with their DVD release.I was anxious to make sure this DVD measured up, so I watched it with my old VHS playing at the same time, and switched back and forth occasionally on the remote to see the difference. It's nothing less than astonishing. The old Winds videos look unwatchable when compared to the new image, which probably looks as close as possible to the way it was shot.This is, of course, a TV miniseries from 1983, long before anyone imagined the resolution of DVD, so it's not going to look perfect. Still, almost every time I switched to the VHS, then back, I literally said ""wow."" Colors are distinct and deep, details are sharp and the variously-colored hazes that afflicted most of the VHS are gone. Having only seen the series this way, the DVDs were a revelation. These discs represent what is best about DVD and its success, bringing a long-quiet catalog title back to life.Although Paramount usually mixes new 5.1 audio tracks for their old films, with 15 hours of film here, they can't be blamed for leaving the existing mono tracks, which are certainly decent and don't detract at all from viewing the film. (I can't understand the other reviewer who gave the DVD set one star, largely because of the audio. Doesn't he understand how prohibitively expensive a new sound mix of that length, for such a complex series, would have been? We're very lucky with what we've got.)Paramount also fixed some framing mistakes on the VHS edition. Large portions of episodes 5, 6 and 7 were noticeably off-center when compared to the re-aligned DVDs. This had never caught my attention before, but when flipping back and forth, I could see that the tops of people's heads were actually lopped off quite frequently on the VHS.I've read horror stories of missing scenes when TV shows find their way to DVD, so I was especially anxious to be sure that wasn't the case. Rest assured, every moment of the VHS version is here. The only difference is that the commercial break spots have now been lengthened to about five seconds, where they were almost instant cuts on the VHS. This gives more of a breather between acts, which I totally approve of. (As for the other reviewer who found scenes that were not on their old VHS, I can't imagine what they were watching, but it wasn't the official Paramount 7 VHS set, which was identical to this new DVD in film content.)The extras are also pretty thorough for a title that's clearly not going to sell millions of units. There are a series of featurettes that actually run into a pretty comprehensive feature-length documentary. Almost all the surviving cast and crew are interviewed, with the standout being series producer/director Dan Curtis.

124679,A17JVI15BRY90P,0792110803,James T. Wheeler,"[3, 3]","In short, ""Winds of War"" on DVD deserves the highest rating.  Casting, direction (by Dan Curtis), scenery, and production values for this 1983 miniseries are all tops.  This is TV at its best, making the drivel we see today seem even more pathetic.  On-location filming of Winds came out great in the transfer to DVD.  Clarity of images and sound are so good we'd swear the film was shot only recently.""Winds of War"" tells the World War II story of a fictional American family, the Henrys.  They are true-blue, U. S. Navy types, a vanishing breed.  Victor ""Pug"" Henry is the father, memorably played by Robert Mitchum.  Rhoda is the mother, also well done by Polly Bergen.  Other stars include Ali MacGraw as Natalie Jastrow and Jan-Michael Vincent as the Henrys's son, Byron.  Natalie is Jewish and older than  Byron but he pursues her earnestly.  They are living in Europe at the time and end up getting married.  This leads to conflict after conflict.  Then they have a son which complicates matters even further.Back to the cast, Ralph Bellamy gives an excellent portrayal of FDR, our war-time president.  Victoria Tennant does well as Pug's extramarital love interest, Pamela, and Peter Graves is good as Rhoda's outside flame.  Ben Murphy does well as the Henrys' older son, Warren, and David Dukes is fine as the American diplomat, Leslie Slote.  Jeremy Kemp plays a fictional German general, von Roon, and does a super job.  Lesser work is done by the actor playing Winston Churchill and John Houseman, who plays Natalie's fugitive uncle, Aaron.History purists may object to the liberties taken by Herman Wouk in his novel and screenplay which have some soap opera qualities.  Nevertheless, the Henrys turn out to be a dysfunctional American family, not so unusual these days.  Wouk's use of fictional characters to act out every day life during wartime makes an impression that pure documentaries can't.  One minute we're invited to a scene where one of Natalie's young relatives is getting married in Poland.  Next minute the same people are being ruthlessly attacked by German warplanes.  In another sequence we see the happy peacetime life in Honolulu as off duty naval personnel celebrate good times.  Next minute we see the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor which brings the conflict into closer, more human terms.""Winds of War"" starts in the late-1930's--before the war breaks out in Europe.  The story ends with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  So, this is only part of the World War II saga.  Five years would pass before the sequel, ""War and Remembrance,"" would be produced.  Many reviewers feel that ""Winds of War"" was superior in many ways, especially since Ali MacGraw and Jan-Michael Vincent were replaced by younger actors.  We're not so sure, but will save our ""War and Remembrance"" review for later.There are some far-fetched aspects that some other reviewers have pointed out.  Pug happens to speak 5 or 6 languages which is no small feat for an ex-Annapolis jock.  With these capabilities, he naturally becomes a confidant to FDR and is assigned all over the world to meet Churchill, Stalin, Hitler, and other dignitaries.  Another feature that is hard to fathom is how Natalie's uncle, Aaron, could have her risk her life and her baby's life trying to save Aaron from the Nazis.  He has bouts of guilt where he says they must escape to America, but then lapses into his old ways of waiting for the worst to happen.  With as tough and independent as Natalie appears to be, it doesn't seem real that she would put up with Aaron's lethargy.""Winds of War"" is a thought-provoking story that deserves a place in any library on World War II.  In addition, the ""making of"" features include interviews with members of the cast and crew.  These help a lot with understanding the piece and how difficult it was to produce.  Our advice is to buy the DVD at its current bargain price and get ready for 18 hours of excellent viewing.  For my wife and I it was both entertaining and educational.",5,"""Winds of War--"" Simply Outstanding",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,4011,"['short', 'Winds', 'War', 'DVD', 'highest', 'rating', 'Casting', 'direction', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'scenery', 'production', 'values', '1983', 'miniseries', 'are', 'tops', 'TV', 'best', 'making', 'drivel', 'see', 'today', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'pathetic', 'On-location', 'filming', 'Winds', 'came', 'out', 'great', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'Clarity', 'images', 'sound', 'are', 'so', 'good', ""'d"", 'swear', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'only', 'recently', 'Winds', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'story', 'fictional', 'American', 'family', 'Henrys', 'are', 'true-blue', 'U.', 'S.', 'Navy', 'types', 'vanishing', 'breed', 'Victor', 'Pug', 'Henry', 'father', 'memorably', 'played', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Rhoda', 'mother', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'Polly', 'Bergen', 'Other', 'stars', 'include', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'Natalie', 'Jastrow', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'Henrys', 'son', 'Byron', 'Natalie', 'Jewish', 'older', 'Byron', 'earnestly', 'are', 'living', 'Europe', 'time', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'married', 'conflict', 'conflict', 'Then', 'have', 'son', 'matters', 'even', 'further.Back', 'cast', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'FDR', 'war-time', 'president', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'well', 'Pug', 'extramarital', 'love', 'interest', 'Pamela', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'good', 'Rhoda', 'outside', 'flame', 'Ben', 'Murphy', 'well', 'Henrys', 'older', 'son', 'Warren', 'David', 'Dukes', 'fine', 'American', 'diplomat', 'Leslie', 'Slote', 'Jeremy', 'Kemp', 'fictional', 'German', 'general', 'von', 'Roon', 'super', 'job', 'Lesser', 'work', 'done', 'actor', 'playing', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'John', 'Houseman', 'who', 'Natalie', 'fugitive', 'uncle', 'Aaron.History', 'purists', 'may', 'object', 'liberties', 'taken', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'have', 'soap', 'opera', 'qualities', 'Nevertheless', 'Henrys', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'dysfunctional', 'American', 'family', 'not', 'so', 'unusual', 'days', 'Wouk', 'use', 'fictional', 'characters', 'act', 'out', 'day', 'life', 'wartime', 'impression', 'pure', 'documentaries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'One', 'minute', ""'re"", 'invited', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'Natalie', 'young', 'relatives', 'getting', 'married', 'Poland', 'Next', 'minute', 'same', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'ruthlessly', 'attacked', 'German', 'warplanes', 'sequence', 'see', 'happy', 'peacetime', 'life', 'Honolulu', 'off', 'duty', 'naval', 'personnel', 'celebrate', 'good', 'times', 'Next', 'minute', 'see', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'conflict', 'closer', 'more', 'human', 'terms', 'Winds', 'War', 'late-1930', 'war', 'out', 'Europe', 'story', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'So', 'only', 'part', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'saga', 'Five', 'years', 'would', 'pass', 'sequel', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'would', 'be', 'produced', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'feel', 'Winds', 'War', 'was', 'superior', 'many', 'ways', 'especially', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'were', 'replaced', 'younger', 'actors', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'will', 'save', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'review', 'are', 'far-fetched', 'aspects', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Pug', 'speak', '5', '6', 'languages', 'small', 'feat', 'ex-Annapolis', 'jock', 'capabilities', 'naturally', 'confidant', 'FDR', 'assigned', 'world', 'meet', 'Churchill', 'Stalin', 'Hitler', 'other', 'dignitaries', 'feature', 'hard', 'fathom', 'how', 'Natalie', 'uncle', 'Aaron', 'could', 'have', 'risk', 'life', 'baby', 'life', 'trying', 'save', 'Aaron', 'Nazis', 'bouts', 'guilt', 'where', 'must', 'escape', 'America', 'then', 'old', 'ways', 'waiting', 'worst', 'happen', 'tough', 'independent', 'Natalie', 'be', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'Aaron', 'lethargy', 'Winds', 'War', 'thought-provoking', 'story', 'place', 'library', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'addition', 'making', 'features', 'include', 'interviews', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', 'help', 'lot', 'understanding', 'piece', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'produce', 'advice', 'buy', 'DVD', 'current', 'bargain', 'price', 'get', 'ready', '18', 'hours', 'excellent', 'viewing', 'wife', 'was', 'entertaining', 'educational']",N/A

This is a long one 15 hours!, but is well worth the time it takes to watch it. Robert Mitchum's performance is absolutely flawless. Ali McGraw does a outstanding job as a jewish woman trapped in a Europe dominated by the jew-hating Nazis. She is trapped because of the trepidation of her uncle, who hates to leave his beloved Italy. As a consequence, she ends up stuck as well. There are many complications, not the least of which is that she is married to an American Naval Officer, Byron Henry, superbly played by Jan Michael-Vincent.The story of the Henry family is only interesting in so far as it connects to the larger WWII narrative. Seeing the direct, human impact that Hitler's aggression and tyranny has on the Henry circle is effective and instructive. However, almost every other aspect of their family story is inconsequential and trite.Winds of War and War and Remembrance are productions that rank with the best ever made.

It was a hit back then, and it remains a hit today, mostly because it is a very good story (thanks to Author Herman Wouk who wrote the book in 1971), and it has a strong cast.  It is a historical series based on fictitious characters.  It is nearly 15 hours long, and the screenplay is very faithful to the book.  The series love theme, by Bob Cobert, is instantly recognizable as the Theme to Winds of War.Suitable for the entire family, this is a very good history lesson for the period 1938-1941.  Herman Wouk, who meticulously researched the novel for historical accuracy, also wrote the screenplay.  Even those with considerable knowledge of the Second World War, will likely glean some informative tidbits from this series.  The portrayals of Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and Churchill are all excellent and accurate.Set in the months before Germany invaded Poland to begin WW2 and extending up to the Pearl Harbor attack, the series chronicles the Victor ""Pug"" Henry family as they cope with the immense challenges a world war brings.  The main star of the series is Robert Mitchum, who plays Captain of the Navy, Pug Henry.  Pug works as the naval attache in Berlin, and has FDR's ear and full confidence.  Pug is about 50 years old in the novel, and Mitchum is about 66 years old when the mini-series aired.  Despite the age discrepancy, Mitchum pulls off the role of Pug with admirable acclaim.  Mitchum's strong performance is what anchors this fine series.  Pug is a no-nonsense, perceptive and intelligent man who will meet with Adoloph Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Wisnston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin.  His ability to foretell future trends based on his perception of current events, makes him invaluable to FDR.  Co-Starring Polly Bergen (Pug's somewhat annoying, socially climbing wife), Jan Michael Vincent (as pugnacious son Byron), Ali MacGraw (beautiful as ever as the Jewish daughter-in-law Natalie Jastrow), John Houseman (as the aristocratic Jewish author Aaron Jastrow), Ralph Bellamy (as FDR- hands-down the best FDR on film anywhere), Peter Graves (as government engineer Palmer Kirby), and Ben Murphy (as son Warren Henry).  The cast is a strong one, and this is what makes the mini-series so enjoyable.  There are no sub-par performances here.  Everyone pulls their weight and then some.Great acting, a strong story-line, a great history lesson, and 15 hours of pure entertainment, make this a very important and enjoyable mini-series.I give it high praise, and enthusiastically recommend it to one and all.kone",4,Excellent WW2 Mini-Series With Great Cast,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,2577,"['mini-series', 'played', 'ABC', '1983', 'was', 'hit', 'back', 'then', 'hit', 'today', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'thanks', 'Author', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', '1971', 'strong', 'cast', 'historical', 'series', 'based', 'fictitious', 'characters', 'nearly', '15', 'hours', 'long', 'screenplay', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'series', 'love', 'theme', 'Bob', 'Cobert', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'Theme', 'Winds', 'War.Suitable', 'entire', 'family', 'very', 'good', 'history', 'lesson', 'period', '1938-1941', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'who', 'meticulously', 'researched', 'novel', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Even', 'considerable', 'knowledge', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'will', 'likely', 'glean', 'informative', 'tidbits', 'series', 'portrayals', 'Hitler', 'Mussolini', 'Stalin', 'Churchill', 'are', 'excellent', 'accurate.Set', 'months', 'Germany', 'invaded', 'Poland', 'begin', 'WW2', 'extending', 'up', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'attack', 'series', 'Victor', 'Pug', 'Henry', 'family', 'cope', 'immense', 'world', 'war', 'brings', 'main', 'star', 'series', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'who', 'Captain', 'Navy', 'Pug', 'Henry', 'Pug', 'naval', 'attache', 'Berlin', 'FDR', 'ear', 'full', 'confidence', 'Pug', '50', 'years', 'old', 'novel', 'Mitchum', '66', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'mini-series', 'aired', 'age', 'discrepancy', 'Mitchum', 'role', 'Pug', 'admirable', 'acclaim', 'Mitchum', 'strong', 'performance', 'what', 'fine', 'series', 'Pug', 'no-nonsense', 'perceptive', 'intelligent', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'meet', 'Adoloph', 'Hitler', 'Benito', 'Mussolini', 'Wisnston', 'Churchill', 'Joseph', 'Stalin', 'ability', 'foretell', 'future', 'trends', 'based', 'perception', 'current', 'events', 'invaluable', 'FDR', 'Co-Starring', 'Polly', 'Bergen', 'Pug', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'socially', 'climbing', 'wife', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'pugnacious', 'son', 'Byron', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'beautiful', 'as', 'ever', 'Jewish', 'daughter-in-law', 'Natalie', 'Jastrow', 'John', 'Houseman', 'aristocratic', 'Jewish', 'author', 'Aaron', 'Jastrow', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'FDR-', 'hands-down', 'best', 'FDR', 'film', 'anywhere', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'government', 'engineer', 'Palmer', 'Kirby', 'Ben', 'Murphy', 'son', 'Warren', 'Henry', 'cast', 'strong', 'one', 'mini-series', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'sub-par', 'performances', 'here', 'Everyone', 'weight', 'then', 'some.Great', 'acting', 'strong', 'story-line', 'great', 'history', 'lesson', '15', 'hours', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'make', 'very', 'important', 'enjoyable', 'mini-series.I', 'give', 'high', 'praise', 'enthusiastically', 'recommend', 'one', 'all.kone']",N/A

I gave it a second star mostly because of nazi uniforms.  They're spiffy.  Unlike those in old black-and-white photos, these in this tv series are clean, crisp, and colorful.  If dress makes an army, they should have won -- at least according to these film-makers.  And we should have lost because the characters on our side were too enmeshed in their romantic intrigues to notice the nazis, much less fight them.

124700,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0792110803,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[33, 36]","Herman Wouk's &quot;The Winds of War&quot; is based on the conceit of the Henry family, who manage to be in most of the &quot;right&quot; places as the United States heads for Pearl Harbor and involvement in World War II.  Rugged &quot;Pug&quot; Henry (Robert Mitchum) travels with his flighty wife Rhoda (Polly Bergen) to Berlin where he is assigned as the military attach&eacute; to the American Embassy.  Because of an acquaintance with Brigadier General Armin von Roon (Jeremy Kemp) of the Germany army, Pug has the opportunity to learn enough about what the Nazis are doing to make an official report predicting that Hitler is going to make a pact with the Soviet Union.  Because he is right, Pug is summoned to Washington, D.C. to meet with Franklin Roosevelt (Ralph Bellamy), and becomes an unofficial envoy for the President.  Meanwhile, son Byron (Jan-Michael Vincent) is in Europe working as an assistant to the scholar Aaron Jastrow (John Houseman), son Warren (Ben Murphy) is training as a naval aviator, and daughter Madeline (Lisa Eilbacher) ends up getting a job working on a radio show.  With these relatively few pieces Wouk covers the invasion of Poland, the German attack on the Soviets, and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.Wouk wrote the script for the 1983 mini-series, directed by Dan Curtis, and one of the major strengths of &quot;The Winds of War&quot; is that it takes its time in telling the story of the Henrys and the Second World War (this would be even more true in the sequel, &quot;War and Remembrance,&quot; which it seemed every episode had a great set piece).  For example, in the second episode there is an extended sequence in which several main characters are caught up with American embassy personnel fleeing Warsaw during the German invasion.  They are brought by the Germans to a warehouse where they are fed, then lined up, and told to identify their Jews.  Diplomat Leslie Slote (David Dukes) refuses and tells the SS they should consider all the Americans to be Jews because Americans do not make a distinction.  One woman immediately complains that she is not a Jew, and the SS officer asks HER to identify the Jews in their party.  The scene is very intense and works without explosions or special effects, just with the knowledge of what is going to happen to the people who are separated from the others.The storyline goes back and forth between the soap opera lives of the Henry family and the start of the war in Europe.  The defining plotline of this mini-series is Byron's involvement with Aaron and his niece, Natalie (Ali McGraw) in terms of getting the Jastrows, who are Jewish, out of harm's way, which is to say, out of Europe.  Of course, Byron falls in love with Natalie and it is there relationship that will end up providing the final scene of the Wouk's massive saga in &quot;War and Remembrance.&quot;The other key soap opera element is the relationship between Pug and young Pamela Tudsbury (Victoria Tennant), the daughter of a renowned British radio commentator.  As unlikely as it might seem, until you get sick and tired of Rhoda, Pug and Pamela become attracted to each other and fall in love, but if you think our hero is going to do anything about that when he is still married, then you have another thing coming.  But fate is going to keep throwing these two together around the globe until something changes as Pug follows FDR's instructions and keeps finding the front seat of the war.&quot;The Winds of War&quot; provides a sense of people living through the history.  Despite the soap opera elements, Wouk provides a sense of history.  Wouk's script ran 962 pages, contained 1785 scenes, shot in 267 locations, in six countries and on two continents, to end up with 15 hours of air-time.  This is not to say that this mini-series is without its flaws.  Mitchum has a commanding presence and you certainly buy the idea that he is a career naval officer, but his acting range is extremely limited and your ability to buy the romance between his character and Pamela is up to you.  However, I do not think you can blame him for his interest.However, the embarrassment in this cast is Ali McGraw.  It is not that the actress was in her 40s when she played the part but just that she is such a bad actress.  Add to that the fact that her character is either stupidly stubborn or stubbornly stupid, a trait inherited from her uncle's side of the family, and you spend most of this mini-series hoping that she gets killed so that Bryon can get home.  However, the Jastrows are obviously fated to go to a concentration camp, and since Natalie and Byron drive by the Polish town once called Auschwitz by the Austrians in the first episode, you even know which one it is going to be.All three of the main actors involved in the Jastrow plotline would be replaced in &quot;War and Remembrance,&quot; and this last time watching &quot;The Winds of War&quot; I tried to think upon how things might have worked if Jane Seymour had been playing Natalie from the beginning.  I have to say that it is McGraw's performance that is the problem and not the character as written.  Seymour could play stubborn without seeming stupid.  But in the end it is clear the Henrys and their acquaintances are just minor figures caught up in a war that is about to involve the entire world.  No wonder that I think some of the best work ever done on television has come in the form of the mini-series.",5,The first half of Herman Wouk's story of the Henry family,1075334400,"01 29,

124704,AG8U6F6226GBZ,0792110803,Lotte,"[3, 7]","Although some reviewers went for the age of Ali McGraw and Jon Michael Vincent, my problem was with the ages of Robert Mitchum and his British girl friend who was obviously at least 40 years younger. Didn't make sense.  Mitchum looked quite old, fat and dowdy as the Naval attach&eacute; to the American embassy.  I would have expected a man in much better condition. But,  I thought Polly Bergen was excellent as his confused wife.  David Dukes was very good as Leslie Sloat and  John Hauseman, as usual, was very good as the historian author, But I didn't care for the  Hitler in Winds, and I thought the Hitler in War and Remembrance was even worse.  Both were way too campy.On the other hand, the story, like the book was excellent, though I think a few of the parts could have been better cast.  I guess I really liked it though because I've seen it many times since I first taped it off of TV, and then bought the videos.  Now, I'm trying to decide whether to buy the DVD's.  I probably will.War and Remembrance changed some of the cast members.  I would have preferred to have seen the same actors again.  Sharon Stone appears for the first time as Janice Henry,  Hart Bochner took over the role of Jan Michael Vincent, and Ali McGraw was replaced by Jane Seymore.  Preferred the original cast there.  Steven Berkoff took over the role of Hitler.  John Gielgud took over the role of Aaron Jastrow.  Actually,  I didn't think any of the replacements were as good as the original cast, but I think about 6-8 years had past , so by then many of the characters were no longer avaiable or they were probably too old for the part.Still the war story was very good, and I'm sure the whole thing was quite true to life, except perhaps Natalie's story which seemed too contrived.  I don't think an American girl with a child would hang around Nazi Europe with a stubborn uncle.  jmo.If you haven't seen it, you should definitely watch it.

Mitchum is assigned to the War Plans department of the U.S. Navy and sent to Germany to work through the embassy there, assessing and keeping on top of the situation in Berlin and Germany. His keen insight and analysis earn him a direct relationship with President Roosevelt (Bellamy) and entrance into the corridors of power throughout Europe and Russia , including meetings with Hitler, Churchill and Stalin. Through his eyes we see and understand the events leading up to our country's direct involvement in WWII. In addition to others, we see the Jewish persecution by Germany develop through the lives of Pug's son (Vincent), a submarine officer, and his fiance and eventual wife, Natalie Jastrow (McGraw), who is Jewish and spends a good deal of time in Europe trying to get her uncle, Aaron Jastrow (Houseman), a famous author to leave his beloved home in Italy. The acting is terrific and the story entertaining and gripping and a great way to learn more about that time in the history of our country and the world. It is part history, part drama and part war story. As close to perfection in a mini-series as you could hope for. Well worth the time and effort to watch. Enjoy.

124711,ADY2T3QG6YSHF,0792110803,Michael A. Weyer,"[0, 1]","""The Winds of War"" is the rare case of a mini-series based on a novel that not only captures the book but improves on it as well. That's mostly because Herman Wouk co-wrote the screenplay and thus much of the book's dialouge remains. It also helps that a good cast and excellent production values recreate the time from 1939 to Pearl Harbor.The cast are mostly good with Mitchum and Bergen matching well as the couple in trouble and Victoria Tennett as the young lady in the middle. Ali McGraw sadly is too old for the part of Natalie and comes off a bit snide as well while Jan-Michael Vincent is a bit bland as Byron. John Houseman is good as Aaron while Ralph Bellamy makes a fine FDR. But the best is Gunter Meiser as Hitler. Rather than go over the top, he is subdued most of the time, the conniving madman who still inspired millions to follow him. His best moment comes at the surrender of France as he actually has a smile on his face at this moment of utter triumph. It's a shame he couldn't reprise it for ""War and Rememberance"" as it's a great portrayl of the man.Overall, the mini does seem more like set up with its reliance on stock footage and narration of major events but does a great showing of Pearl Harbor and battle scenes.

They see the effects of Nazi Germany in the way that the Jewish servants are treated. The Winds of War details Hitler's obsession to open the concentration camps and how the Jewish community reacts. Meanwhile, the two sons choose to go their own way, one follows his fathers' footsteps and enters the military, and the other travels to Italy to study under a prestigous professor.Each are placed in different parts of the world and which enables us to see how the world was responding to Hitler's position. As we follow this family, we see them fall in love, marry, and gather together to face the coming war. The Winds of War takes us to Pearl Harbor when talk of war ended and active participation begins. I would seriously recommend this to anyone who has never seen the effects of Hitler's butchery.

With great locations and cinematography, and good music, its hard to fault. The biggest flaw, as some have mentioned, is the casting.  Age is the biggest problem.  It's like the creators made up their mind on the casting of some of these roles when the book was published and the fact that the characters are too old for their roles years later when the series was made is ignored.  Natalie (Ali McGraw) is the biggest problem. Her acting is sophmoric, but she is supposed to be 28 in the book. If she looked more sophmoric, rather than her 45 years, I think her brassy, gauche performance would be more forgivable, particularly since that is the character she is playing.  It's just hard to accept in someone of her age and looks.  It also is kind of ridiculous that in some scenes she looked older than Byron's mother, expertly played by Polly Bergen, who is only a few years older than McGraw.  Bergen's character Rhoda was supposed to be charming and attractive, and while her character in the book is not entirely likeable (nor meant to be), she plays her role to a T and I found her subplot a good foil to her husbands mission and the war background. Robert Mitchem is okay as Pug, but he playedthe role so one dimensionally, I don't really see why he was so essential to the production. Seems to me any number of actors could have done as well or better and been more believable in age as to his time of life, career and romance with Pam. As it stands, he makes it hard to  imagine there  could be a real romance between him and Pam Tudsberry, also expertly played by Victoria Tennant.So many minor characters are wonderful:  Bellamy as Roosevelt, Kemp as von Root.I have watched this miniseries several times and it is always as engrossing as the first time.

Dan Curtis (that's right...the Dark Shadows guy) put together the biggest mini-series of all time (topped only by it's sequel in length and span) and it was a ratings smash.  A week long mini-series experience like no other.  Headed up by Robert Mitchum in a role he was born to play and populated with some of the most distinquished film and television actors of the time (along with the requisite male and female ingenues of the day) it is a vast and sprawling story of the events leading up to World War II kept intimate and watchable by the focus on a single family that was the genius of Herman Wouk's internationally best selling novel.  This is history told with a timeline that is astonishingly accurate and clear and made palatable by it's dramatic story woven in among the historical events themselves.  It was a genius of a book and Dan Curtis saw to it that it got transferred to the screen mostly intact.  He was a much better producer storyteller than anyone has ever given him credit and this mini series and it's sequel five years later 'War and Remembrance' are his testaments.  The sheer scope of the two (40 hours) is mind boggling but necessary to bring Mr. Wouk's work to fruition for a movie oriented audience.  I cannot recommend this highly enough if you want to learn the clockwork inner workings of the events that preceded and drove World War II to it's conclusion and be entertained first class all the way.

I missed the original presentation of TWOW when it was first shown on television, but later bought the videocassete version, which was enjoyable enough.  Unfortunately, I did not realize (until I got the DVD version) that the VHS version omitted a great many scenes of the original miniseries.  This DVD version appears to present TWOW in its entirety, as far as I can tell.  Wonderful!This is a very well-done presentation of Wouk's masterpiece--essentially tracking an American Naval family through pivotal events just prior to America's entry into the Second World War. The viewer is introduced to prewar Nazi Germany, the Nazi invasion of Poland, Britain's early struggles against the Nazis, issues surrounding President Roosevelt's attempts to prepare America for its inevitable entry into the War, and its aid to the British. As other reviewers have mentioned, the casting is fabulous.  Robert Mitchum is perfect as Victor Henry, Jan Michael-Vincent is a great Byron Henry, John Houseman is wonderful as Aaron Jastrow, Victoria Tennant is magnificent as Pamela Tudsbury.  All of the leads do very well in my opinion.  Further, the script is very faithful to the novel, rarely deviating from it, and this is a plus, because the novel moves at a steady pace with a solid storyline.  The result is that this is a miniseries that does not feature much in the way of draggy pointless interludes the way so many miniseries sometimes do.

The only example I've ever come across is Larry mcMurtry's &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot;  However, with the exception of a few casting errors, &quot;Winds of War,&quot; is the perfect example of how a powerful story can correct all other blunders.  Some complain that the movie is too long, but I feel this only adds to it's authenticity and attention to detail.  Thank God Herman Wouk had a hand in writing the screenplay.  Michem plays the character of Pug a little too flatly, but he gets the job done.  I agree with those who say the parts of Byron and Natalie weren't cast very well, but again, the story drowns out all flaws.  The best trait is that the series is very faithful to the book.  Several reviewers have complained that many issues go unresolved in this story.  Obviously, these people wrote their commentary before viewing or reading the sequel, &quot;War and Remembrance.&quot;  This is a beautifully krafted masterpiece and it is far superior to most other popular works of WWII fiction.",5,"Move Over, Spielberg...Wouk's here.",1036800000,"11 9, 2002",2002,1174,"['When', 'first', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'quot', 'Winds', 'War', 'quot', 'was', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'television', 'series', 'live', 'book', 'only', 'example', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'come', 'across', 'Larry', 'mcMurtry', 'quot', 'Lonesome', 'Dove.', 'quot', 'However', 'exception', 'few', 'casting', 'errors', 'quot', 'Winds', 'War', 'quot', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'powerful', 'story', 'can', 'correct', 'other', 'blunders', 'complain', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'feel', 'only', 'authenticity', 'attention', 'detail', 'Thank', 'God', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'had', 'hand', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'Michem', 'character', 'Pug', 'little', 'too', 'flatly', 'job', 'done', 'agree', 'who', 'say', 'parts', 'Byron', 'Natalie', 'were', ""n't"", 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'again', 'story', 'out', 'flaws', 'best', 'trait', 'series', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'many', 'issues', 'go', 'unresolved', 'story', 'Obviously', 'people', 'wrote', 'commentary', 'viewing', 'reading', 'sequel', 'quot', 'War', 'Remembrance.', 'quot', 'beautifully', 'krafted', 'masterpiece', 'far', 'superior', 'most', 'other', 'popular', 'works', 'WWII', 'fiction']",N/A

Smith,"[0, 0]","Wouk's 2 part epic novel, Winds of War and then War and Remembrance, were OK, def not Caine Mutiny quality....but Robt Mitchum's acting is worse than the fat German waiter's, and Ali McGraw simply does a reprise of Love Story, wh/ stank because of her acting (My opinion, folks, JMHO).  Read the book (LS).Wouk's character Pug is miscast, as is Natalie's (Ali).  The other actors really act around the poor performances of Mitch and McGraw...The movie can't decide if it's a love story or war epic; tries both, fails at both.The story revolves around pre-war (U.S. involvement) rumblings, Hitler, and one fairly prominent families' involvement, with predictable soap-opera type sub-plots.  The 2nd part (W andR) is the war and the war's end, a diff disc..Mitchum strolls around woodenly, McGraw is totally oblivious to her lovestruck ex-fiance', standing next to her while she discusses wedding plans w/ new beau....and it's Ali who's oblivious, not the character.  She's still floating on Love Story celebrity, ""everybody just loves me so, so much!"", who cares if she can act, or has any idea of the story she's in, she's Ali McGraw!  Ali could be in Disneyland for all she knows....war, what war?Mitchum was really good in Cape Fear, Thunder Road; it's almost as though he's sick w/ some terminal disease; he's just not there.

Produced by Dan Curtis andBarbara Steele.Starring Robert Mitchum, Ali MacGraw, Jan-Michael Vincent, PollyBergen, Victoria Tennant, John Houseman, David Dukes, Topol. JeremyKemp, Ben Murphy, Peter Graves, William Woodson(as the narrator),Ralph Bellemy (as Franklin Delano Roosevelt), Wolfgang Preiss (as FieldMarschall Walter Von Brauchitsch), Howard Lang (as Winston Churchill),Anton Diffring (as Joachim Von Ribbentrop) Barry Morse, Barbara Steele,Matt Clark, Scott Brady, Edmund Purdom, Lawrence Pressman, LeoGordon, Ferdy Mayne, Sky Dumont (as Count Galeazzo Ciano) Karl -OttoAlberty, Geoffrey Lewis, John Dehner (as Admiral Ernest King), JohnKarlen, Patrick Allen (as Air Vice Marshall Sir Hugh Dowding), AlanCuthbertson, George Murdock, Alexander Kerst (as Field Marshal WilhelmKeitel), Joachim Hansen(as Field Marshal Alfred Jodl) , Charles Laneand Gunter Meisner as Adolf Hitler.In Sept, 1939, National Socialist Germany under Adolf Hitler, alongwith Communist Russia---though this is not mentioned here---invadedPoland and so began the Second World War in Europe. This miniseriestells the story of the first three years of that massive conflict usingthe fictional naval family the Henrys whose members all manage to bewhere the big things happen and the major figures are. Mainly throughthe Mitchum character who as a naval attache to just about everywheregets to meet everyone from Hitler to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, theminiseries dramatizes the events up to and including the attack ofImperial Japan on Pearl Harbor and America's entry into the war. Onthe more personal side, Henry's son Byron is in love with a beautifulJewess who is in Italy with her cantakerous uncle--a famous author--whorefuses to believe that they should get out of Europe QUICKLY thussending those two characters on a step by step journey through whatwill become the Final Solution.First off......as characteristic of Curtis' career as he did withhorror and gangster films--this is really a very long 1940s World WarTwo era film....that just happens to have been made in 1983. There isnothing here that an American audience in 1944 would have beenunfamiliar with. The Nazis are right out of Conrad Veidt, GeorgeSanders and Martin Kosleck. The communists are....sadly..right out ofMISSION TO MOSCOW. Wouk is obviouisly a Leftie who never met a Red hedid not like and also a BIG FDR fan but this is how it should be forthe era. The period feel is, as should be expected, perfect ineveryway. People smoke and drink like fishes with nary a speech aboutcancer and alcoholism. The Japanese are refered to as ""Japs."" It isremarkably and gloriously retro and old fashioned. Which is too say itis ennobling, educational and entertaining. Movies for adults. And thelast of the truly great World War Two epics that began during the Waritself and was brought to a close by Curtis here. After this, it wouldall be down hill.The special effects are a combination of superb model work and realequipment. It is a real treat to see real Stukas diving bombing Polishrefugees and real---albeit--model U boats surfacing before Americanlend lease ships. The Pearl Harbor attack is the second best thisviewer has seen after TORA TORA TORA and there is an air raid on Cavitein the Philippines that this viewer has never seen filmed before so weare getting not just remakes of previous hits but new editions to theWW2 battle library.The production is not perfect and there are flaws that would onlyincrease into the sequel WAR AND REMEMBRANCE. Wouk tends to lay on theJewish Holocaust material with a derrick and he is so intent on gettinghis Jewish characters to Auschwitz eventually that he makes them look abit stupid. They have so many opportunities to escape Europe and flubthem that, after awhile, one almost expects them to buy train ticketsthemselves back to Poland. Also Wouk never can quite find a balancebetween the thrilling and fascinating history and the usual soaperadultery/young love stuff but then neither did war films of the 40s and50s. Us guys learned to just grit our teeth and pray for Panzers andthe Gestapo to show up. Cobert's score by the way is truly brilliantand needs a CD release. Curtis direction and the cimematography are asgood as anything...say Michael Curtiz would have done. There is nogreater compliment than that.And the cast is a dream....not only of the major talent working in the70/80s like Topol, Dukes, McGraw but the film is prctically a whos whoof major acting talent going back to the War. While libs roll on theground frothing about John Wayne, the simple fact is that starting withGUNG HO in 1943, Robert Mitchum has accumulated more WW2 films to hiscredit than any other American actor and this film...and the sequelbenefits immensley by his stolid presence. This also marks his swansong in the genre. It is great to see old reliables like Graves, Lane,Karlen, Cuthbertson, Allen among others who appeared in so many filmslike this throughout their careers etc etc making appearances and who,like Mitchum, were making swan songs. Curtis deserves great credit forthat. On the historical front, Curtis was magic at perfect casting.Jochem Hansen as Jodl, Diffring as Ribbentrop, Dehner as King andfinally Bellamy and Meisner who ARE FDR and Hitler respectively arebrilliant examples of definitive iconic performances. After this, whenyou think of the real men, you think of these actors. They are THATgood and the production preserves their brilliance.A fantastic historical epic and a great achievement.Highly recommended.",5,One final glow of brilliance before the rot set

This movie is in Chronological Order which I like. I am also learning early on in it's War and Remembrance sequel, the 2nd chapter is not in order of time but roughly what is going on in each war theatre at each time ( I will explain more when I complete the monster sized W & R). I cannot believe that when I was 20 years old, ...thirty years ago, I would not watch it. Why? I was already a huge WW2 history buff in 1983 when this came out.  But it was the 80's back then so I figured it was just another network TV ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty.""  Yes, romance and affairs occur. But do not worry WW2 history freaks.  This is, quite simply, the best MINI-SERIES I have EVER seen!  AND, the most accurate in almost all historical details with just a couple minor flaws. It can hold a very serious WW2 candle to the best of all WW2 Theatrical Releases and trust me I have seen just about ALL OF THEM!  They literally filmed this all over the world in the most beautiful of locations and countries. Made for TV Movies like this and it's sequel will NEVER HAPPEN again due to budget and the fact that cheap reality garbage is what is on TV today.  The acting is superb with the great John Houseman, the rock solid Robert Mitchum (one of my favorites all time! Yes a bit old but still growing strong here) and others. A couple/few of actors did not fare so well, like other reviewers have posted. Most notably, Ali MacGraw.  She over reacts at times and is especially noticeable with her acting scenes with the great actor John Houseman. Jan Michael Vincent is not solid either but somewhat passable. Polly Bergen as Robert Mitchum's wife Rhoda is a scatter brain but plays her role ok, I guess. But don't let these minor details stop you beyond the first 20 minutes.  This ENTIRE series is very, very good. I RARELY ever give out 5 STARS. My only negative is the title musical score and the opening title scenes of the stars. I like the music theme, it's good, but too overused at times. It becomes a bit irritating, especially during the romantic scenes.  They should have had a secondary music for a lot of these scenes.  Anyway, I am extremely impressed.  I can't wait to see ALL of it's sequel, WAR and REMEMBRANCE! P.S. The Narrator is very good too.If you like Robert Mitchum, you must see ""The Enemy Below"" one of the best Sub flicks ever and ""Thank Heaven Mr. Allison"" the original ""Cape Fear"" and his cameo as Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey"" in ""MIDWAY"" along with so many other great films he did.Finally, on the subject of WW2, I would like to share MY opinion on the WORST WW2 movie of all time:  It's Jerry Bruckheimer's, Michael Bay's and Ben Affleck's ""PEARL HARBOR."" What DISRESPECTFUL, historically inaccurate TRASH this is. To use the title name as they do and show no respect to the veterans and who died there. Then, try to maximize the movie off the success tail of Titanic for $$$! I thought Titanic was a good movie, as at least James Cameron got his historical details down to the last tea cup on board. This movie, Pearl Harbor, will simply waste 3 hours off your life. Like one reviewer said, he wished he could purchase all the DVD copies in the entire world and burn them. No one plays little league baseball at 7:30 am on a Sunday morning.

In my videotape library I later found at least few hours that I had taped from the original TV presentation back in 1983 (but never had the time or inclination to watch.There is no way to praise Dan Curtis enough for what he was able to bring to the screen.The one actor who was overlooked in the credits - or at least received less credit than due - was Gunter Meisner (his name is even botched in the amazon.com details) who played Hitler with a perfection to make you swoon.I had not read the book, although I have read ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" twice (once in the summer of 1968 and once in the late 70s) so I had some cobwebbed familiarity with the material, but the presentation of the history alone was stunningly powerful, in no way distorted by the Henry family dramas.I'm reading ""War and Remembrance"" now.",5,Deserves 10 or 15 Stars (perhaps 45 Stars (5 for each 2 hours)),1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,1165,"['watching', 'epic', 'when', 'brain', 'was', 'not', 'totally', 'absorbed', 'asked', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'filmed', 'WITHOUT', 'running', 'WWII', 'Europe', 'anyway', 'AGAIN', 'One', 'other', 'commentor', 'said', 'close', 'tot', 'ime', 'travel', 'can', 'get', 'How', 'true', 'watched', 'DVD', 'course', '14', 'days', 'was', 'astonished', 'videotape', 'library', 'later', 'found', 'least', 'few', 'hours', 'had', 'taped', 'original', 'TV', 'presentation', 'back', '1983', 'never', 'had', 'time', 'inclination', 'watch.There', 'way', 'praise', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'enough', 'what', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'screen.The', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'overlooked', 'credits', 'least', 'received', 'less', 'credit', 'due', 'was', 'Gunter', 'Meisner', 'name', 'even', 'botched', 'amazon.com', 'details', 'who', 'played', 'Hitler', 'perfection', 'make', 'swoon.I', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'Third', 'Reich', 'twice', 'once', 'summer', '1968', 'once', 'late', '70s', 'so', 'had', 'cobwebbed', 'familiarity', 'material', 'presentation', 'history', 'alone', 'was', 'stunningly', 'powerful', 'way', 'distorted', 'Henry', 'family', 'dramas.I', ""'m"", 'reading', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'now']",N/A
