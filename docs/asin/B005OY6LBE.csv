1496925,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005OY6LBE,A kids review,"[2, 8]","Not long after his turn as Captain America, Chris Evans hit theaters again, but this time in a very small, very limited release called Puncture. Based on true events, the film focuses on a pair of Houston lawyers who agree to defend an ER nurse who's been pricked by a contaminated needle. As the attorneys delve deeper into the case, they uncover a web of conspiracy that involves a widespread medical issue and the shady underbelly of the pharmaceutical industry. I was willing to go with the story, which I found compelling, but I was a little reluctant to buy into the formulaic plotting that drove the narrative along. Puncture isn't quite the equivalent of The Insider, but it should get the job done for those looking for a passable potboiler featuring a rising star.",1,Puncture,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,774,"['Not', 'long', 'turn', 'Captain', 'America', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'hit', 'theaters', 'again', 'time', 'very', 'small', 'very', 'limited', 'release', 'called', 'Puncture', 'Based', 'true', 'events', 'film', 'pair', 'Houston', 'lawyers', 'who', 'agree', 'defend', 'ER', 'nurse', 'who', 'been', 'pricked', 'contaminated', 'needle', 'attorneys', 'delve', 'deeper', 'case', 'uncover', 'web', 'conspiracy', 'widespread', 'medical', 'issue', 'shady', 'underbelly', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'story', 'found', 'compelling', 'was', 'little', 'reluctant', 'buy', 'formulaic', 'plotting', 'drove', 'narrative', 'along', 'Puncture', ""n't"", 'quite', 'equivalent', 'Insider', 'should', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'looking', 'passable', 'potboiler', 'featuring', 'rising', 'star']",Puncture
1496926,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B005OY6LBE,Anne-Marie G,"[1, 1]","I watched this because I was curious to see what other acting Chris Evans had done besides certain broader roles. I saw hints of some really great acting inCaptain America: The First Avenger [HD] but I only picked up on that on subsequent viewings (his acting is really good, but it got buried in the hype of a superhero movie).In Puncture he not only carries the film, but his acting is allowed to really shine. I was really able to believe him as this character--which considering I had just rewatched Captain America, says something.He plays an attorney who's life seems to be in a bit of chaotic shambles. His wife has left him, he parties with the fringes of society and is a very, very heavy drug user. All of that being said, he is a very interesting character. He uses his friends as mock trial participants to come up with brilliant legal ideas. He is very, very smart, but just seems unable to deal with the world around him in a way that isn't self destructive.He is partners in a small law firm that helps a larger firm with cases to make ends meet. While doing this a case is brought to them about a nurse who contracted AIDS from a needle jab in the ER. She doesn't want compensation, she wants to get a needle into hospitals that a friend of hers invented. This needle would prevent an accident like hers from happening again.Mike, Chris Evans' character, is immediately touched by her story and wants to help. His partner, the more pragmatic and practical of the two, points out that they are ill equipped to take on hospitals and the medical supply industry. Mike is unable to leave the crusade alone.Its an intense movie and had me absorbed from the beginning. I was honestly skeptical when I hit play, but I really don't regret it. I wish there more movies out there like it. It is based on a true story--and it is one that should get told. It shows how money has made its way into holding people's safety hostage.If Chris Evans continues to make movies like this as well as Captain America--well, he really is going to be an actor to contend with. Watching this made me wish Netflix had more of his work to stream. He makes interesting choices with his movies, now that he has the ability to pick things and I am curious to see what else he will do.The other actors in this are all very believable, and the direction has an appropriate level of grittiness and intimacy that is needed for this story.  I also, really liked the soundtrack.",5,"Great, Great Movie.

1496933,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B005OY6LBE,Doug Park,"[2, 2]","""Puncture"" has all the subplots, complications, reversals, and other necessary ingredients for suspense. It also has some startling revelations to make about the spread of AIDS, the greed of the health care industry, and general state of the American legal and political systems. However, we aren't shown enough for this film to be really illuminating, and it's hard to tell where the facts end and where the fiction begins.Too much time is spent on the details of Weiss's drug addiction and wild lifestyle, time that would be better devoted to the complexities of Weiss and Danziger's case against United Medical. We're asked to believe that Weiss--a real-life character--was, despite his many faults and weaknesses, a brilliant legal mind, yet there is nothing here that really bears that out. We get only brief glances at the public demonstrations and negative publicity against the healthcare providers, and more in such areas would help. Other scenes which introduce new (and important) characters are hurried and not quite earned.Some good acting here, but unfortunately, the best of it's not from the top stars. Evans and Kassen (as the attorneys) just don't seem in-character, and much of their dialogue sounds flat and rehearsed. The really impressive role-playing comes from Vinessa Shaw (whose character deserves a lot more time in this story) and Marshall Bell as the clients in the case.Underdeveloped as it is, ""Puncture"" remains a different sort of legal thriller and one that fans of this genre will likely find both intriguing and fairly enjoyable.",3,A Film of Many Pros and Many Cons,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,1565,"['Puncture', 'subplots', 'complications', 'reversals', 'other', 'necessary', 'ingredients', 'suspense', 'also', 'startling', 'revelations', 'make', 'spread', 'AIDS', 'greed', 'health', 'care', 'industry', 'general', 'state', 'American', 'legal', 'political', 'systems', 'However', 'are', ""n't"", 'shown', 'enough', 'film', 'be', 'really', 'illuminating', 'hard', 'tell', 'where', 'facts', 'end', 'where', 'fiction', 'begins.Too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'details', 'Weiss', 'drug', 'addiction', 'wild', 'lifestyle', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'devoted', 'complexities', 'Weiss', 'Danziger', 'case', 'United', 'Medical', ""'re"", 'asked', 'believe', 'Weiss', 'real-life', 'character', 'was', 'many', 'faults', 'weaknesses', 'brilliant', 'legal', 'mind', 'yet', 'nothing', 'here', 'really', 'out', 'get', 'only', 'brief', 'glances', 'public', 'demonstrations', 'negative', 'publicity', 'healthcare', 'providers', 'more', 'such', 'areas', 'would', 'help', 'Other', 'scenes', 'introduce', 'new', 'important', 'characters', 'are', 'hurried', 'not', 'quite', 'earned.Some', 'good', 'acting', 'here', 'unfortunately', 'best', 'not', 'top', 'stars', 'Evans', 'Kassen', 'attorneys', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'in-character', 'much', 'dialogue', 'flat', 'rehearsed', 'really', 'impressive', 'role-playing', 'Vinessa', 'Shaw', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'story', 'Marshall', 'Bell', 'clients', 'case.Underdeveloped', 'Puncture', 'different', 'sort', 'legal', 'thriller', 'one', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'intriguing', 'fairly', 'enjoyable']",Puncture
1496934,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005OY6LBE,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","PUNCTURE is an apt title for this movie, a true story that pokes a hole in the corporate and governmental greed that endangers public health, and a story about the lawyer who despite poking holes in his veins as a drug addict brought to the attention of the public a safety problem of overwhelming significance. It is tautly written by Paul Danziger (a character in the story), Ela Thier and Chris Lopata and directed by Adam and Mark Kassen. It is an important film for public viewing and knowledge and awareness.Opening this true story with a young nurse mother Vicky Rogers (Vinessa Shaw) departing for work at the hospital we witness her accidental stabbing herself with a needle while trying to calm a boisterous patient. Fast forward a few years later and we meet two law partners - Mike Weiss (Chris Evans, brilliant in a demanding role and boasting one of the most impressive physiques in cinema!) and Paul Danziger (Mark Kassen) - both seemingly committed to idealistic cases but bogged down in the routine accident settlement cases to make a living. Enter Vicky Rogers, now with full blown AIDS she contracted form the needle puncture we observed and asking Mike and Paul to take on a case of making the hospitals across the country aware of a retractable safety needle invented by engineer Jeffrey Matthew Dancort (Marshall Bell), who owns the Safety Point Company, but is unable to sell his product to any hospital from the United Medical group, apart from San Antonio Memorial. Mike and Paul are committed to Vicky and the cause and take the case on, only to be blindsided by hospital purchasing agents who want to save the hospital money and not buy the slightly more expensive safety needle. As the young men take on the horrors of the case they encounter the powerhouse lawyer Nathaniel Price (Brett Cullen) who represents the stonewall of United Medical. The money in the office of the young lawyers runs out and Paul wants to pass the case on to another law group, but Mike wants to keep the case, gathers mountains of evidence to prove that hospitals and supply companies are preventing the distribution and sales of the safety needle. He even gains the support of Senator O'Reilly (Kate Burton) until she withdraws her support as United Medical makes a huge contribution to her campaign!Complicating the tense story is the fact that Mike is addicted to cocaine, pain pills and heroin and his addiction is constantly resulting in his being late and missing deadlines. At the point where Mike decides to give in despite his idealistic motives to win the case the story ends with a staggering reality. The results of the story are given on the screen before the credits role.This is a very strong story, well directed an written, and in many ways due to the bravura performance of Chris Evans drives home some realities we all need to acknowledge: money and greed speak louder than patient and hospital staff safety.

1496936,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005OY6LBE,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 2]","The ""Based on a True Story"" hook of PUNCTURE wears its welcome not too long after the first act, but it's a powerful punch of a first act. In essence, this is the tale of the small Houston personal injury law firm Danzinger and Weiss who, on behalf of a nurse dying of AIDS from an accidental needle stick, take on Big Medical and their vast monopoly over the products they produce. It's a pretty predictable tale all around from anyone who's seen pretty much any legal drama ever. The characters are pretty stock as well as the plot. We have longtime character actor Marshall Bell (from just about every film you've seen since the mid-80's) as the grizzled, ornery designer of the live-saving safety needles; Brett Cullen (most recently seen on PERSON OF INTEREST) as the slick-as-a-snake big-time defense attorney; Mark Kassen (the film's co-director, with his brother Adam) as Paul Danzinger, the responsible, practical and harried partner; Vinessa Shaw (perhaps best known for her role as ""Domino"" in Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT) as the dying nurse that kickstarts the film's tale and Michael Biehn as the shadowy and mysterious man that seems to be pursuing the protagonists, who we don't know is friend or foe. Doesn't sound very original, does it?That's until you factor in Chris Evans as Mike Weiss, the other half of the firm. Weiss is a pretty serious drug addict as we see very early on in the film. In a dynamic introduction to his character, he's been on a bender of cocaine in a dumpy motel room and is preparing questions for a witness and practices on another user. As we also see early on, Weiss has a very unusual lifestyle (he keeps an alligator in a wading pool; he drinks health-nut juices like wheat grass while constantly abusing his body with cocaine, an assortment of pills, heroin, etc.) and is rapidly heading for a divorce presumably due to his constant affairs and his rampant drug use. But when he meets Shaw's character and sees what is going on in the medical supply industry, it becomes less about the kind of ambulance-chasing law they've been doing and more about starting something on a possibly global scale. This, of course, awakens something perhaps long dormant within him about what being a lawyer is really about.Evans, despite his more recent star-turns as Captain America, is a consumate actor who really gives Weiss a sense of perpetual mania; when he's in motion, he is almost hyperkinetic, but when he crashes, he crashes hard. There's rarely a moment in the film where his character hits a false note, and the story is infinitely more interesting when he's on screen. As charming and energetic as Evans is, he shows a deeply vulnerable side that he rarely gets a chance to show when he isn't busy commanding superheroes.The film does a commendable yet all-too-predictable job of showing how hard it is for a small law firm to take on a large cabal of evil corporations and their machinations and influence over other businesses, the government, and perhaps even life itself as the film's climax is met with echoes of the great Meryl Streep film SILKWOOD. All of the performances, while rote, are effective with the exception of Mark Kassen, who just seems a little out of his depth here. The film is directed with some style but the film doesn't want to take too many risks by making Weiss out to be a bad guy, or to explore the darker sides of his life in too much depth, which is sad because the film is almost clone-like in its ERIN BROCKOVICH construction and it could benefit by bringing something much more unusual to the table that really sets it apart.Aside from Evans' performance, PUNCTURE is a take-it-or-leave-it legal drama that has moments that stay with you, but unfortunately, they're too few and far between.",3,"Aside from Evans' terrific performance, it's very standard.",1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,3770,"['Based', 'True', 'Story', 'hook', 'PUNCTURE', 'welcome', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'first', 'act', 'powerful', 'punch', 'first', 'act', 'essence', 'tale', 'small', 'Houston', 'personal', 'injury', 'law', 'firm', 'Danzinger', 'Weiss', 'who', 'behalf', 'nurse', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'accidental', 'needle', 'stick', 'take', 'Big', 'Medical', 'vast', 'monopoly', 'products', 'produce', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'tale', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'pretty', 'much', 'legal', 'drama', 'ever', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'stock', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'have', 'longtime', 'character', 'actor', 'Marshall', 'Bell', 'just', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'mid-80', 'grizzled', 'ornery', 'designer', 'live-saving', 'safety', 'needles', 'Brett', 'Cullen', 'most', 'recently', 'seen', 'PERSON', 'OF', 'INTEREST', 'slick-as-a-snake', 'big-time', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Mark', 'Kassen', 'film', 'co-director', 'brother', 'Adam', 'Paul', 'Danzinger', 'responsible', 'practical', 'harried', 'partner', 'Vinessa', 'Shaw', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Domino', 'Kubrick', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'dying', 'nurse', 'film', 'tale', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'shadowy', 'mysterious', 'man', 'be', 'pursuing', 'protagonists', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'friend', 'foe', ""n't"", 'sound', 'very', 'original', 'factor', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Mike', 'Weiss', 'other', 'half', 'firm', 'Weiss', 'pretty', 'serious', 'drug', 'addict', 'see', 'very', 'early', 'film', 'dynamic', 'introduction', 'character', 'been', 'bender', 'cocaine', 'dumpy', 'motel', 'room', 'preparing', 'questions', 'witness', 'practices', 'user', 'also', 'see', 'early', 'Weiss', 'very', 'unusual', 'lifestyle', 'alligator', 'wading', 'pool', 'health-nut', 'juices', 'wheat', 'grass', 'constantly', 'abusing', 'body', 'cocaine', 'assortment', 'pills', 'heroin', 'etc', 'rapidly', 'heading', 'divorce', 'presumably', 'due', 'constant', 'affairs', 'rampant', 'drug', 'use', 'when', 'Shaw', 'character', 'what', 'going', 'medical', 'supply', 'industry', 'less', 'kind', 'ambulance-chasing', 'law', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'more', 'starting', 'something', 'possibly', 'global', 'scale', 'course', 'something', 'perhaps', 'long', 'dormant', 'what', 'being', 'lawyer', 'really', 'about.Evans', 'more', 'recent', 'star-turns', 'Captain', 'America', 'consumate', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'Weiss', 'sense', 'perpetual', 'mania', 'when', 'motion', 'almost', 'hyperkinetic', 'when', 'hard', 'rarely', 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'character', 'false', 'note', 'story', 'infinitely', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'screen', 'charming', 'energetic', 'Evans', 'deeply', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'rarely', 'chance', 'show', 'when', ""n't"", 'busy', 'commanding', 'superheroes.The', 'film', 'commendable', 'yet', 'all-too-predictable', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'hard', 'small', 'law', 'firm', 'take', 'large', 'cabal', 'evil', 'corporations', 'machinations', 'influence', 'other', 'businesses', 'government', 'perhaps', 'even', 'life', 'film', 'climax', 'met', 'echoes', 'great', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'film', 'SILKWOOD', 'performances', 'rote', 'are', 'effective', 'exception', 'Mark', 'Kassen', 'who', 'just', 'little', 'depth', 'here', 'film', 'directed', 'style', 'film', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'too', 'many', 'risks', 'making', 'Weiss', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'explore', 'darker', 'sides', 'life', 'too', 'much', 'depth', 'sad', 'film', 'almost', 'clone-like', 'ERIN', 'BROCKOVICH', 'construction', 'could', 'benefit', 'bringing', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'unusual', 'table', 'really', 'Evans', 'performance', 'PUNCTURE', 'take-it-or-leave-it', 'legal', 'drama', 'moments', 'stay', 'unfortunately', ""'re"", 'too', 'few', 'far']",Puncture

Evans charms us in the opening scene as he invites fellow drug addict strangers to stand in for his drug-induced mock trials where he rehearses cross examinations for the next day in court.  You root for this chemically-dependant smooth talker from square one.A little background:  The title has well-placed meaning in this story which was based on true events.  Our two protagonists take a case for a nurse who was accidently stuck by a syringe after it left the violently flailing arm of an HIV-positive patient (who was overdosing on some drug in when he arrived at the hospital).  After the subsequent development of the safety syringe called ""Safety Point""--a medical development that would make such accidents nearly impossible--no hospitals were willing to purchase the product.  Hospital employees are concerned about such accidents, which occur to the tune of 800,000 times a year in the USA and are the lead cause of HIV, hepatitis-B and hepatitis-C in health care workers.  These accidents are called ""needlesticks"" and have fueled the AIDS-epidemic in Africa as a result of needle re-use.Weiss and his straight-laced partner (Paul Danziger, played by Mark Kassen) have an entertaining relationship and ambulance-chasing personal injury business complete with TV ads.  Weiss barters ""focused"" days doing his job in exchange for Danziger following up on case work in his own unique style.At the dawn of his David and Goliath case Weiss maintains his ill-suited form indulging in cocaine ""bumps"" and handjobs from his fellow druggie-turned-office assistant...then falls asleep in the car during a critical deposition which, of course, he'll join late after nursing a bloody nose.The movie did not affect me emotionally.  It felt largely like the telling of an important story accompanied by a great Chris Evans performance.  My biggest criticism is that Evans--while made up to look pale, hungover, and baggy eyed throughout the movie--is in WAY too good shape for me to buy his drug-fueled self-abuse.  Had the real life Weiss ever been in such good shape, I have difficulty understanding how his body wouldn't be noticeably withered after even one month of such malnourished, under-rested, toxic behavior.This criticism aside, I enjoyed the movie and was impressed by Evans, who managed to deliver ""strung out and tweaky"" simultaneously with the clever charm we expect from him.

Well written and directed, Puncture moves well and has very few slow or dead spots, and rarely preaches. By far the highlight is Evans' bravura performance as Weiss, a serious drug addict and devoted legal mind, who comes off as far more lovable and understandable than most actors could ever hope to convey.It's a tough role easy to overdo, but Evans just nails it in every way, and takes many over the top scenes and makes them quite real. It's darn near Oscar quality, in fact. A beautiful tribute to a most fascinating soul, even though the drug use is truly over the top and hardly endearing. If watching someone slowly implode on drugs will trouble you, then this film will trouble you, as it never shies away from Weiss' intense addiction, to all and sundry pills and powders. Sad to see.Everyone else is at least good here, especially Brett Cullen, perfect as the rich foil lawyer far beyond scruples. He embodies the profit at all costs attitude that still runs big business.The blu-ray looks good but has zero extra features, a real drag as I would love to hear a commentary or see a doc about how this was adapted from the true story.Perhaps legal issues prevented that? In any case, an unfortunately missed opportunity.[Spoilers coming...] One thing I felt let down by was the supposed ""victory"" ending, a Pyrrhic victory at best, as the big shot lawyer shows up to battle the other big shot lawyer, and wins, and the screen tells us that the big medical murder firm paid off a 150 million lawsuit, like that's some sort of victory after millions dead due to their greed. 150 billion wouldn't be enough. But that's how it went, and how it still goes, as the screen also notes that many hospitals here and across the world still don't use the safety needles.Sigh.

Mom tries to inject the patient only to get pricked herself with a contaminated HIV needle, hence the title of the film, ""puncture."" After the credits we see a trial lawyer (not hard to guess how these two subplots come together) who is in a cheap motel with 2 sleazy looking women and large amounts of cocaine. He is going over his next court case. Chris Evans stars as Mike Weiss, a lawyer with his own demons.Nurse Vicky is already being compensated for her injury so there really isn't a case for her. However Mom is on a crusade. A one time disposable syringe has been developed that has a retractable needle that would prevent workers from getting infected...and hospitals won't even look at them as an option because of how their group purchasing operates. The non-charismatic manufacturer of the needle says, ""Is there anyway we can sue a hospital for not buying something that saves people's lives?"" While smoking a crack pipe with a naked woman, Mike gets an idea. He discovers that there has been 800,000 needle punctures to health care workers in the US. In investigating why hospitals won't buy this needle, he breaks out the large ""Glen Beck conspiracy board"" and draws lines and connects dots and discovers large corporations, payoffs, kickbacks, and a few well placed politicians.The film reminded me of an absurd ""Erin Brockovich."" Unlike ""Erin Brockovich"" we really don't feel for the victims. At one point Mike is late for a meeting and while in the restroom he develops a ""too much nose candy"" nose bleed.

When the movie starts to grab you, they roll the end credits.F-bomb, brief nudity, lots of drug use",3,MOVIE ENDS WHEN IT STARTS TO GET INTERESTING,1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,2087,"['film', 'based', 'true', 'story.The', 'movie', 'nice', 'happy', 'indie', 'soundtrack', 'Happy', 'mom', 'Vinessa', 'Shaw', 'Vicky', 'little', 'girl', 'off', 'school', 'smiles', 'work', 'hospital', 'trauma', 'ward', 'man', 'wheeled', 'struggling', 'bad', 'PCP', 'reaction', 'Mom', 'inject', 'patient', 'only', 'get', 'pricked', 'contaminated', 'HIV', 'needle', 'hence', 'title', 'film', 'puncture', 'credits', 'see', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'not', 'hard', 'guess', 'how', 'two', 'subplots', 'come', 'together', 'who', 'cheap', 'motel', '2', 'sleazy', 'looking', 'women', 'large', 'amounts', 'cocaine', 'going', 'next', 'court', 'case', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Mike', 'Weiss', 'lawyer', 'own', 'demons.Nurse', 'Vicky', 'already', 'being', 'compensated', 'injury', 'really', ""n't"", 'case', 'However', 'Mom', 'crusade', 'one', 'time', 'disposable', 'syringe', 'been', 'developed', 'retractable', 'needle', 'would', 'prevent', 'workers', 'getting', 'infected', 'hospitals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'option', 'how', 'group', 'purchasing', 'operates', 'non-charismatic', 'manufacturer', 'needle', 'there', 'anyway', 'can', 'sue', 'hospital', 'not', 'buying', 'something', 'people', 'lives', 'smoking', 'crack', 'pipe', 'naked', 'woman', 'Mike', 'idea', 'been', '800,000', 'needle', 'punctures', 'health', 'care', 'workers', 'US', 'investigating', 'why', 'hospitals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'needle', 'out', 'large', 'Glen', 'Beck', 'conspiracy', 'board', 'draws', 'lines', 'connects', 'dots', 'discovers', 'large', 'corporations', 'payoffs', 'kickbacks', 'few', 'well', 'placed', 'politicians.The', 'film', 'reminded', 'absurd', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'victims', 'one', 'point', 'Mike', 'late', 'meeting', 'while', 'restroom', 'too', 'much', 'nose', 'candy', 'nose', 'bleed', 'What', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'drama', 'out', 'be', 'mediocre', 'screen', 'play', 'lack', 'luster', 'performances', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'historical', 'political', 'sense', 'drama', 'When', 'movie', 'grab', 'roll', 'end', 'credits.F-bomb', 'brief', 'nudity', 'lots', 'drug', 'use']",Puncture
1496950,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B005OY6LBE,Tony Heck,"[23, 23]","""Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest places""  This is the true story about Mike Weiss (Evans) a personal injury lawyer who takes on a huge health supply company after one of his clients is infected with a dirty needle.  The client is a nurse in a hospital that uses plastic needles that are re-used over and over.  Mike wants to make it so every hospital only uses the one time use only needles that his other client manufactures.  The only problem is that Mike is a drug addicted mess.  This movie is deceiving.  The first half hour to me was a little slow and wasn't sure if I could make it through.  When it picked up, it really picked up and sucked me in.  By the end of the movie you are very engrossed and are pulling for someone you normally wouldn't.  A movie much like ""Runaway Jury"" mixed with ""The Lincoln Lawyer"", not quite as good as ""Lincoln Lawyer"" though.  Overall, a very good law movie that will make you think.  I give it a B+.*Also try - Lincoln Lawyer & Runaway Jury",4,"A different take on the lawyer movie.  Starts slow, by the end you are rooting for a drug addict.  Not a usual thing.
