I had mixed feelings for the movie, but overall the movie is fun. It is stupid over the top and filled with action, as well as mixed with the comedy. What I loved about the movie is the 80's thing. It gave the right feeling. There are many people which reviewed this movie as bad. But it's not bad. It is a parody. It is made for laugh. Yes there are stupid things in this movie, as well as mix of other things. But that's why it's so good. I like what they've done to it. It is not the best movie I've seen, but it's worth buying or renting. There were times where I thought how stupid it was and times where I was disappointed. Like when the van with his friends blow into pieces by MacGruber's c-4. His first team of friends could have played funny roles but were blown into pieces by the script. I didn't like that. But then he get's another team, smaller(which I also didn't like much)but characters were funny as well. You have to watch this movie in order to understand if it's something you'll like.

MacGruber is portrayed as a sniveling incompetent Ex-navy Seal who doesn't know how to use a gun?  He win's by lucky mistake when he's not cowering.  His one liner's are funny because he says so, and he says so in the movie so you'll know.Will Forte is the star and one of the writers, so I guess he came up with the movies big sight gag of him shuffling around naked with a celery stick sticking out of his butt while holding onto his crotch.  This must be funny as it's repeated by Ryan Phillippe later on.  However, for those of you so inclined, you do get to see the male stars butts naked several times during the movie.The Blu-ray includes the Unrated version but not for nudity.  The only naked folks you see are the male stars and yet the movie has a cameo of the WWF star Big Show being scratched of the team for apparently being gay.  Again, Male stars butts seen naked several times. Hum.The movie is rated R or Unrated which says it's meant for folks 17 or older.  But the humor is strictly for boys 13 or younger.  The only thing I found good about this movie was the fact that I rented it for a dollar.  In retrospect, that was 99 cents too much. It's not on My Wish List for DVD's I want to put on my shelf.

I went in expecting a war movie of some sorts and got what can best be described as some kind of imitation of the 80's action flick genre.The character MacGruber is incredibly obnoxious.  In fact most of the humor is based on really offensive swear words and even the name of the bad guy himself is a swear word.The soundtrack is pretty awesome- a lot of really fabulous popular songs from the 80's.  Most of the songs happen to be personal favorites of mine, too such as a certain Toto and Eddie Money song.Basically the character of MacGruber has to stop a missile from launching that can destroy Washington DC, and along the way he finds himself in hilarious situations, many of which aren't even related to the main storyline at all (such as one really funny scene where he makes out with his girlfriend then goes to a graveyard and... makes out with another woman, hehe).I can't deny that, despite a good portion of the jokes completely missing the mark, many of them were in fact funny.  I was a bit disappointed being a WWE fan that when they shown Chris Jericho, the Great Khali and the Big Show among others, that they were only featured briefly and didn't actually play into the storyline any.  Oh well, minor disappointment I suppose.Just be warned that this is not a comedy for youngsters because there's a lot of sexual-related jokes, and don't expect a coherent storyline either.

1307019,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,B002ZG98B4,"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow""","[2, 8]","... based on many of the other reviews here I rolled the dice and bought myself a copy. Wow.You know those SNL skits that fall flat and just seem endless as the actors reach desperately for a laugh - ANY laugh? MacGruber rides high near the top of the list, and stretching it into a full length feature isn't doing either the actors or the viewers a bit of good.Ever the masochist, I watched the extended Director's Cut hoping that, shedding the constraints of the MPAA, the potential was there to fully realize the character(s) in a way live tv simply doesn't allow. I was sorely mistaken. I'm a huge fan of over the top comedies - Walk Hard is one of my favorites, as well as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and it's ""sequel."" How bad could MacGruber really be?Well... it isn't enough to have Magruber use a stalk of celery in the nastiest way possible while creating a diversion, he actually TRAINS someone else to do it later in the film. Some might call that over the top humor. If so, than this movie was made just for you. There is a trend in ""humor"" that goes back a good way, but seemed to really take off with Austin Powers in Goldmember; The more disgusting something is, the more it becomes ""over the top hilarious."" In Goldmember it was Austin drinking a mug of hot, liquified human waste. The problem with this sort of thing is that once it succeeds once, every comic and every hack screenwriter has to up the ante and ""outgross"" the previous efforts. This is not humor - it's the cheap way out for unimaginative minds that lack the skills to truly amuse an audience. It doesn't take long for this sort of thing to grow old. I submit as evidence the box office gross of Goldmember(213 million domestic)and The Love Guru (less than 41 million domestic)as just one example. (For those who successfully avoided the latter, it ""out-grosses"" Goldmember by tossing elephant sex - obviously without researching first - into the mix.)When an SNL sketch works out as a movie, it's a blast to watch, but they tend to miss more often than they hit. The funniest character ever created by Jon Lovitz - Tommy Flennagan the pathological liar - never made the jump to the big screen because Lovitz couldn't write a full-length screenplay out of what was essentially a one trick character. Others haven't shown that wisdom - ""It's Pat the Movie"" anyone?I've been involved with writing and performing comedy for a lot of years and know a bit about the science of rhythm and meter involved in creating something truly laughworthy. There is a place for gross-out comedy - my own version of the Aristocats bit was always as nasty as I could make it - but it belongs in the mix of something larger, not as the central ""showcase"" moment of an entire film.I'm sure some will say I ""don't get it"" because I'm too old (53) to appreciate ""modern"" humor. Yet there are many recent comedies such as those I've already mentioned, that I've truly loved, so age has nothing to do with it. I watch movies and accept them for what they are, whether they are supposed to be deep and insightful (""The Family Thing,"" ""Schindler's List"" etc) or low-brow funny (""Animal House,"" ""Brain Donors"" for example.)MacGruber fails on virtually any level. It doesn't draw from enough material (primarily one old and dated tv series?) to qualify as a decent genre satire, it lacks the genuine emotion that God gave earthworms, and makes no attempt at being witty whatsoever.Save yourself.

The writers are smart; they know that no additional time is required for us to get the joke, for us to understand that it's a parody of ""MacGyver."" MacGruber finds himself locked in a control room with a bomb only seconds away from detonating. He relies on his assistants for comically mundane items to help disarm the bomb. He gets distracted by something irrelevant. The bomb explodes. End of skit. We have a good laugh and then move on to this week's musical guest. The great disappointment of the film ""MacGruber"" is that, because we get the joke so early on, we have the remaining eighty-plus minutes to realize we're seeing a whole lot of the same thing over and over again.While this movie does generate the occasional chuckle, it never really becomes funny, probably because it has little to work with other than its one-joke premise. Yes, the MacGruber character is vulgar and stupid and ill-mannered and stuck up and inept, but so what? Is there nothing else to go on, here? Even the original ""Pink Panther"" films had more going for them than the bumbling antics of Inspector Clouseau. He was a funny character put into funny situations, and most of the time, he was in the presence of other funny characters. MacGruber is an amusing character put into situations that are anything but funny, and his companions can only react drearily to his bad behavior. One of them is played by Ryan Phillippe, an actor I believe is accomplished enough to not have to resort to pulling down his pants and sticking a celery stalk where it ought not be stuck.The plot: MacGruber, allegedly the best of the best when it comes to disarming weapons (Will Forte), is coaxed out of hiding in Ecuador upon learning that his arch nemesis (Val Kilmer) is in possession of a missile with nuclear capabilities. His original handpicked team (played mostly by WWE superstars) is lost rather unpleasantly, so he's forced to turn to his rival, Lt. Dixon Piper (Phillippe), and an old friend, Vicki St. Elmo (Kristen Wiig), who will serve no real purpose except to be an occasional MacGruber decoy, complete with a bad wig fashioned after his mullet.That's about as much of the plot as you need to know. The filmmaker's aren't all that interested in the plot, anyway; they put all their effort into MacGruber's inane dialogue, mostly made up of thoughtless slips of the tongue, confrontational jabs, and crude four-letter words. I was particularly turned off by his begging for forgiveness; it's a recurring gag, and it involves him describing in excruciating detail what he's willing to do in order to be given a second chance. Had it only been used once, then maybe it might have been funny. When done more than once, it comes off as a desperate ploy for cheap laughs. The same can be said for two especially tasteless sex scenes, one of which involves a woman who ... let's just say she isn't quite what the average man is looking for in a partner. Both scenes begin decently enough, but then they abruptly cut to graphic alternate viewpoints and drop the mood-enhancing music, replacing it with overblown ambient noises.And speaking of the music, it seems the more I search for an angle of approach, the more I realize that all I've got is the soundtrack, comprised mostly of wonderfully nostalgic `80s hits. I was especially happy with the inclusions of Mr. Mister's ""Broken Wings"" and Eddie Money's ""Take Me Home Tonight,"" the latter I confess to making one of my regular YouTube searches. What can I say? I like that song. Some humor can be found in the opening theme song, which spoofs the slinky, heart-pounding tone of a typical `80s action series. Even then, one wonders why they had to include lyrics spelling out that we are, in fact, watching a movie. I figured that out long before I bought my ticket.I suppose it would be too much to say that I hated ""MacGruber,"" because truth be told, I've seen comedies much, much worse than this. Nevertheless, I didn't feel much of anything watching it. It was just kind of ... there on the screen, passing before my eyes from one scene to the next. MacGruber head-butts Lt. Piper. That's nice. MacGruber repeated tears out people's throats. That's nice. MacGruber threatens to do nasty things to his arch enemy's manhood. That's nice. I'm no expert in comedy writing, but I do know that, if I'm to laugh from beginning to end, I require more than a silly character doing silly things; there also needs to be a genuinely funny situation, and it should resolve itself in a way that doesn't appeal to the lowest common denominator. This movie doesn't even come close to achieving all that. Movies like this prove some stories need no more than sixty seconds to be adequately told.",3,Some Characters Need No More Than a Minute of Your Time,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,4847,"['best',

1307023,A35FC3DWA1M79H,B002ZG98B4,Christopher,"[1, 16]","First, I did not buy this (thank god!), I watched this on a premium (!) channel.  I like stupid over the top comedies so I figured I would watch this.  This was one of the biggest mistakes ever!This film is horrible!  The actings is bad, the story is bad, the costumes are horrible - I could go on!  From reading reviews, I see that this was a Saturday Night Live skit.  I guess it figures since I do not watch SNL.  Some (unfunny) people say I do not like SNL because I don't ""get it,"" but I don't get why it is still on the air!  It is not funny and when something could be funny, they have a habit of over-doing it on the jokes and stretching it out to the point that you just want it to end!  This is what MacGruber does.From the onset this film is an example of how not to make movies.  It starts with a plot, then the plot disappears.  You think that it will be funny and you keep waiting, but then you realize that there are only a few jokes that worked.  This film was overly sexual - homosexual in particular.As MacGruber assembles his crew, one of the crew memebers - a big white blad guy, recieves a glass of lemonade and a kiss from the guy bringing it.  MacGruber then erases his name from the list of a crew!  I thought that was funny.  However, later on and throughout the film, we are left wondering if MacGruber is gay or not.  Once he loses his crew and needs another, he begs a guy to join and out of no where, he offers to perform oral sex on the guy!  He also has his pants down, back turned ready to recieve gay sex if the guy would join his crew.  Of course this had me scratching my head.  This was not funny or sick, it was perplexing.Still another scene has MacGruber trying to enter an old wharehouse where enemies are gaurding it.  MacGruber's idea of a distraction is to run around naked with a celery stick hanging from his butt!  Not funny, but very homosexual.  I am not sure the messege they were trying to send, but that was not the end of the homosexual references in this film.  This types of garbage is not funny at all and it seems more in the form of further brainwashing our society towards this lifestyle.Now, some love to poitn out ""Illuminati"" things in films, so I have picked a few in this film.  Aside from the homosexual things, you had MacGruber's female friend who was forced to dress as a male on occasions which or course along with MacGruber's bi-sexual behavior, suggests androdgeny ala Lady Gaga.  Then there were the OWLS clearly on the bookshelf.  People know what the owls represent (you can find one on your dollar).  In case that was a mistake, they showed another owl as MacGruber was having a bullet removed from his thigh.  The owl was in the shape of a penis, although it was supposed to be some type of tray to hold the bullet.  Clear signs.Propaganda aside, this film is horrible no matter what points (sinister or innocent) it was trying to get across.  Truth be told, this ""flim"" should be burned as history and society would not miss this one at all.  It is hard to believe that the studios wasted money pressing up Blu-Rays!  They should have just hoped for money from cable and Pay-Per-View!

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 1]","MACGRUBER (2010) deserves a review from me (because I got some laughs and a LOT of fun seeing Ryan Phillippe's naked bottom half).Let me start by giving leprechaun-faced Will Forte a happy nod: he's a bit of a combination of Trey Parker and Scott Bakula. This works in an odd, everyday-Joe sort of way, but I am afraid it does not increase the laughs too much. In fact I was also reminded of Dana Carvey's foray into film comedy. Blessedly brief. I shall hope Forte will expand and become funnier, rather than die off the way Dana did. After all, Forte has an impressive tv r&eacute;sum&eacute; and I'd like to see him inflate his actor's creds.Forte plays MacGruber, a clear rip-off of ""MacGyver"" - and I only know that because I had a friend who thought he was MacGyver (or however you spell it). What was slightly amusing for me was seeing Forte act like this friend I had. (It was not amusing to have had a friend like that, though, I can tell you.)Ryan Phillippe, who seems to be playing the intrepid Eric O'Neill (BREACH, vid. my review) in every film he makes, plays 'straight man' to Forte's MacGruber. Phillippe is always a joy and a beautiful, gorgeous hunk and I can't get enough of him. With his talent, though, I'd be shunning throwaway gross-out comedies like this. Why hasn't he been offered a hip update of ""Hamlet""?!The cast is rounded out by my decades-long favorite Powers Boothe and my eternal I'm-not-so-sure-about-him Val Kilmer. Boothe shows what a real actor can do: he's 100% straight in his role, plays it smooth and professional and yet somehow he made me laugh exactly as he planned, no doubt. That man is an underrated, underused legend.That is all I can say. This movie was not meant to be a cult classic, a real powerhouse comedy (or else Ben Stiller might have jumped at this) - it's merely yet another ""Saturday Night Live"" disposable entertainment.

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[0, 3]","There are some sights that I had hoped to go the rest of my life without witnessing, and now that I have seen ""MacGruber,"" I can safely say that a nude Will Forte with a celery stalk protruding from a certain bodily orifice - not once, but twice - is one of them. ""MacGruber"" is based on a Saturday Night Live sketch which parodies the 80's show ""MacGyver.""  Feature-length movies based on SNL sketches are like the little girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead: when they're good, they're very good, and when they're bad, they're horrid.  This is one of the latter.MacGruber is a rather insecure man, despite supposedly being brilliant at assembling gadgets to detonate the bomb or whatever. He also seems to have a touch of ADD because he's often easily distracted while in the midst of a crisis.  Although retired at the start of the movie, he's drafted to find a man who incidentally, murdered his fiance at the altar.  (This is shown in vivid flashback.)  He scorns the assistance of rookie Ryan Philippe, and assembles a crack team of top agents to help him on his quest, but this backfires.  So he swallows his pride, takes Ryan Philippe and Kristen Wiig and goes to seek revenge.  In the film's defense, I suppose you could argue that it's supposed to be goofy - it's a parody.  But there are funny parodies and parodies where you keep waiting for the humor to arrive, and this was one of the latter.Is there anything positive I can write about the movie?  Well, Kristen Wiig, as MacGruber's sidekick and love interest, is adorable, if underused, and Val Kilmer playing the villain is amusing. Still, it's not quite as bad as say, ""It's Pat,"" or ""Stuart Saves His Family"" (to use older examples), but it's not good either.",2,Better as a sketch.

SNL hasn't been funny since the 90s! How can they make movie out of such a stupid and unfunny character?"" Well, I thought the same thing, but then I saw the movie with an open mind. The result? Stupid. Hilarious. Brilliant.Anybody that says it wasn't funny, or that it was a bad movie was either too offended (understandable), or full of crap. Sure, it may look bad, but go into it with an open mind, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Don't believe me? Here's a rundown of the 3 most hilarious scenes:1: MacGruber has sex with his wife's ghost at her grave in a cemetery. However since she's not real, he's thrusting air. Hilarious visual.2: MacGruber has a scene where, he's becoming friends with Ryan Phillippe, then they're ambushed, and MacGruber uses Phillippe as a human shield, causing him to get shot up. Unknowing to MacGruber however, Phillippe is wearing a bulletproof vest. Hilarious visual.3: Kristen Wigg is undercover as MacGruber in a coffee shop. She tips the guy behind the counter, but MacGruber would never do that, so she is forced to take back her tip from the tip jar in front of the poor dude. Then, MacGruber is attacked in his van, and since Kristen Wigg is supposed to be saying everything he is, she ends up lying on the floor screaming ""OH MY GOD!"" Another hilarious visual.It basically plays itself as a serious 80s action film, but it'll just throw out ridiculous gags. For example, MacGruber says, ""You're loco man!"" The screen then pops up a subtitle saying, ""You're crazy man!"" There's also running gags about a license plate, celery etc. There's so many jokes flying past, it's almost Arrest Development like. Again, these statements may sound out of line, but you must watch the film to know what I'm talking about.Overall, with story that fits the action, great jokes & a cast that supports it and sells it all, MacGruber does what so many spin-offs & SNL films haven't done, it stands alone as a great piece of entertainment. You don't have to know to skit to like this movie, you don't even have to like SNL today to like this film. The two are completely different. This film is almost out of the Apatow school of thinking, and I will defend this film as one of the best films of the year thus far.

1307032,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B002ZG98B4,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[2, 4]","The 3 star average for this film is pretty generous, being that it is another failed SNL skit turned film. It really is a fairly simplistic formula, and most of the time this formula is true:SNL Skit + Full length movie= Lame filmSome examples: A Night at the Roxbury, Pat the Movie, Superstar,  The Ladies' Man.Sure, there are a few exceptions: The Blues Brothers and Wayne's World come to mind.The biggest problem is that there just isn't enough material from a skit to make something like this work over the long haul of ninety minutes (or, in MacGruber's case, eighty minutes), unless there is a certain appeal to the film. And, there really isn't much appeal to this film at all. And, truth be told, even the skit is pretty mediocre.I think MacGruber pretty much operates on the same level as a Saturday Night Live episode: there are a few scenes that are funny, but everything else is just plain stupid and/or not funny. It's too bad: this is a film that could have really put together a fine spoof of the popular series MacGyver, but instead it just went the convenient and popular potty humor, profanity and sex joke route. Had the film taken the direction of actually making MacGruber make fun, or satirize, MacGyver, it would have made for a better comedy. The film does start off on this route, but then quickly spirals off into another direction. As some reviewers have pointed out, Will Forte just acts like a babbling, whiny, idiot who uses profanity and obscenities to garner some laughs.  Ha. Ha. Why not make this film about the ""MacGyverisms"", and spoof this? There are some aspects of a plot here, but they don't do enough to make this really happen. Taken a different direction, this film could have been funny, and still had time for all its obscene, stupid humor. (As a side note, you'll never hear  Mr. Mister's ""Broken Wings"" in quite the same way...)MacGruber is another unoriginal comedy that isn't worth the time.

1307034,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B002ZG98B4,GratedTopping,"[3, 6]","Nope, I didn't like this one much at all.I enjoyed the skits about the character on the ""Saturday Night Live"" show, but making a movie based on that tiny idea wasn't worthwhile. It could have been done much better and the majority of SNL-based movies from little ideas are not worth much time.In this flick, there was too much sex-related 'humour' and plenty of cursing, with the f-word being most stated. Even in the opening, the lady singing the title song is stating ""He made a -ing movie...MacGruber."" It assisted in making the parody not likable.This is based on the idea of the 1980's TV show ""MacGyver"", where he was a regular guy who could use science and his creative mind to figure ways out of tough situations. Instead of just grabbing a weapon and killing the baddies, he'd escape their attempts to harm him and then bring them to justice.I wanted this to be more MacGyver-like, with the guy just being a person who tries to do right but messes up a lot. MacGruber, the character, is a whiny, babyish, foul-mouthed, immature guy.The character did a couple things that were like ""MacGyverisms"" (which is term that some use when one thing is used to help in a unrelated/unexpected way) which were okay. I remember MacGruber in a van that was being shot at and he used a broom to push down the gas pedal. Apparently, the van was already ready-to-go without the key being turned and could drive itself, though....I remember MacGruber trying to create a homemade grenade from a bunch of junk that failed miserably (and that was funny). Then, there's the horrible moment where he uses a stalk of celery in a gross way to distract bad guys while his partner opens fire. I admit that was a little bit funny in a sick way, but when MacGruber was whining and begging someone to allow him to do something to stay on the case, it was pathetic and unnecessary.I saw a video with Richard Dean Anderson, ""MacGyver"", saying that he did like the ""MacGruber"" skits on TV. He was even in a few of them, which was great. What would he think of this movie? In an old interview right when his show was ending, I recall how he spoke of how ""MacGyver"" appealed to families and had ultimately an anti-violence/anti-gun message. Because MacGruber is just such an unlikable character with a filthy mouth, who never used guns because he didn't know how but then got to shoot a lot by the end of the film, I know that Mac wouldn't like him. I'm thinking that Mr. Anderson might not like this flick as much as well. I'm glad he didn't make a guest appearance in this stinker.This is not just a fan of ""MacGyver"" being unfair; so much cursing and sex-talk is just not funny to me. It had bad writing and a flimsy story. Ultimately, I was hoping for just a nerdy-like ""MacGyver""; the same character in the skits that I did enjoy and laughed at. Instead, this was just uninteresting, offensive, boring and not terribly funny...and MacGruber was not the same character that I liked.MINI-'SPOILERS': I did like the ""upper decker"" bit, where Mac describes what that means; and when the lady had to take the tip back from a donation jar in the store because MacGruber wouldn't have done that (and she was pretending to be him)The explosions were awesome; Ryan Philippe was funny; Val Kilmer (as von Cunth) was cool as well. This could have been a good parody, but I was disappointed. I'm a fan of stupid comedy, but this was rather lame in too many spots and there didn't have to be so much filth.See the ""MacGyver: The College Years"" fan-series that is out there on the internet.

Even still, this comedy spoof works well for anyone familiar with A-Team antics and MacGuyver the show itself.  This movie could be described as ""intense absurdity"".  In spite of its  comic value, the story actually seems to go somewhere and sucks you right into the melodrama of the moment.  A moment later you are busting up with the ridiculousness of it.  But after that you are once again pulled into the story, only to have the same cycle repeat itself, in a variety of ways, again and again.  The film is surprisingly violent with MacGruber himself litterarly aiming to pull out the throats of his enemies.  He accomplishes this more than once during the movie, re: isn't for the kiddies, in spite of its inanity.  That and lots of gay innuendo - MacGruber in this film is one tweaked out action hero.  Still, for the kind of film that it is, fitting somewhere in the Airplane, Police Academy, Hot Shots genre, it gets a good score for simutaneously having an interesting plot and being utterly ridiculous.

1307046,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B002ZG98B4,Jordan David,"[1, 1]","Whenever SNL was fortunate enough to entice me during my commercial break channel surfing, I was usually only drawn in when a MacGruber skit was running.  These brief, low-brow, live-or-die by the punch-line runners were ideal for efficient entertainment, something that I feel SNL is sorely lacking as of late.Apparently, I wasn't alone as, lo and behold, a rare species again emerges to take another shot at the limelight:  An SNL skit on the big screen.  And it's in the form of none other than Will Forte's mockery of an 80's TV icon.And, sure enough, this film is loaded with low-brow highlights (none of which feature Richard Dean Anderson, surprisingly).  In an industry where comedy's trying to find the right mark between the raunchy and the relevant, Taccone and Forte have dragged the genre down, down, down to its most primal and blunt.  The results?  Often unsettling, and occasionally uproarious.That said, MacGruber is still a movie that gives to its audience.  For every minute of seat-squirming disturbance, there are two that leave you with internal hemorrhaging.  In other words:  When it's funny, it's very funny, and you wont find much of anything in the middle.  It's all or nothing with MacGruber.  You'll certainly be in tears at some point during this film; the variable lies in whether or not it will be from laughter, or disgust.  And again that's because, much like its protagonist, the movie is simply uncompromising in its style of humor.In a league of SNL skits desperately grasping for the fame of Mike Myers' past, MacGruber makes a decent argument for us to not give up on this subgenre.  Well, half of us.  The other half of the audience left the theatre.This movie owes much of its rhythm to a very likable trio, spearheaded by Forte himself, who predictably owns the role like it was his own (which it is).  Wiig is a real sweetheart; there are so few films that she's taken part in that don't benefit from her being there, and Macgruber is no different.  The two work so well together that Phillippe almost seems like an afterthought, but I suppose that the conflict between he and Forte was a script decision that couldn't get nicked in time.  He's not baggage, but you wont remember much of what he said in the presence of Forte's absurdities and Wiig's lovable uneasiness.  And Kilmer is actually making a compelling argument for us to completely ignore his lead-role potential in favor of obscure, out-of-place supporting positions.  Who knew?So, there we are.  It's not all that hard to figure out if MacGruber is or isn't for you.  All you really need to do is grab a Wes Andersen project and divide by zero, because it's basically the antithesis of the indie director's efforts.  Me, I can find a laugh (or two, or three) in its dirty presentation and even dirtier execution.  Others may want to turn up their nose to it.  But let's be honest:  Your nose was in the air the second the previews started using potty humor.",3,MacGruber,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2965,"['Whenever', 'SNL', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'entice', 'commercial', 'break', 'channel', 'surfing', 'was', 'usually', 'only', 'drawn', 'when', 'MacGruber', 'skit', 'was', 'running', 'brief', 'low-brow', 'live-or-die', 'punch-line', 'runners', 'were', 'ideal', 'efficient', 'entertainment', 'something', 'feel', 'SNL', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'late.Apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'alone', 'as', 'lo', 'behold', 'rare', 'species', 'again', 'take', 'shot', 'limelight', 'SNL', 'skit', 'big', 'screen', 'form', 'none', 'other', 'Will', 'Forte', 'mockery', '80', 'TV', 'icon.And', 'sure', 'enough', 'film', 'loaded', 'low-brow', 'highlights', 'none', 'feature', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'surprisingly', 'industry', 'where', 'comedy', 'trying', 'find', 'right', 'mark', 'raunchy', 'relevant', 'Taccone', 'Forte', 'have', 'dragged', 'genre', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'most', 'primal', 'blunt', 'results', 'Often', 'unsettling', 'occasionally', 'uproarious.That', 'said', 'MacGruber', 'still', 'movie', 'audience', 'minute', 'seat-squirming', 'disturbance', 'are', 'two', 'leave', 'internal', 'hemorrhaging', 'other', 'words', 'When', 'funny', 'very', 'funny', 'wont', 'find', 'much', 'anything', 'middle', 'nothing', 'MacGruber', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'be', 'tears', 'point', 'film', 'variable', 'lies', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'laughter', 'disgust', 'again', 'because', 'much', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'simply', 'uncompromising', 'style', 'humor.In', 'league', 'SNL', 'skits', 'desperately', 'grasping', 'fame', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'past', 'MacGruber', 'decent', 'argument', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'subgenre', 'Well', 'half', 'other', 'half', 'audience', 'left', 'theatre.This', 'movie', 'much', 'rhythm', 'very', 'likable', 'trio', 'spearheaded', 'Forte', 'who', 'predictably', 'role', 'was', 'own', 'Wiig', 'real', 'sweetheart', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'films', 'taken', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'benefit', 'being', 'there', 'Macgruber', 'different', 'two', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'Phillippe', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'suppose', 'conflict', 'Forte', 'was', 'script', 'decision', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'nicked', 'time', 'not', 'baggage', 'wont', 'remember', 'much', 'what', 'said', 'presence', 'Forte', 'absurdities', 'Wiig', 'lovable', 'uneasiness', 'Kilmer', 'actually', 'making', 'compelling', 'argument', 'completely', 'ignore', 'lead-role', 'potential', 'favor', 'obscure', 'out-of-place', 'supporting', 'positions', 'Who', 'knew', 'So', 'are', 'not', 'that', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'MacGruber', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'do', 'grab', 'Wes', 'Andersen', 'project', 'divide', 'zero', 'basically', 'antithesis', 'indie', 'director', 'efforts', 'Me', 'can', 'find', 'laugh', 'two', 'three', 'dirty', 'presentation', 'even', 'dirtier', 'execution', 'Others', 'may', 'want', 'turn', 'up', 'nose', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'nose', 'was', 'air', 'second', 'previews', 'started', 'using', 'potty', 'humor']",N/A

This movie is WONDERFUL.  I fell in love with it the moment I watched it.  It's both a throwback and a parody of 80's action flicks.  If you loved those, you'll love this film.  Most people who critizice this movie do it for three reasons, either because they don't get the references to classic films, becausse they misinterpret the jokes or because they think it's similar to the TV show.I know from good sources that the latter belief is false.  And I can tell you that this movie is fun for all the good reasons.  Yes, it does have some jokes that might look juvenile, but just like with, say, South Park, those jokes are there as an excuse for the much more interesting, smarter and way funnier parodies of other material.Give this movie a chance.  Don't take the negatives at face value.

1307066,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG98B4,RMurray847,"[0, 2]","MACGRUBER is an appallingly bad movie.  And this is from a guy who kinda liked the SNL skit that led to this movie.  Will Forte plays MacGruber, a take-off on MacGyver, the top secret agent kinda guy who always created useful or destructive devices through the use of everyday items and his own ingenuity (or something like that, I never watched the show).  In the SNL skits, MacGruber is always trapped in a room with a time bomb, usually of the nuclear type, ready to go off.  He gets those trapped in the room with him (always Kristen Wiig and the guest star of the week) to toss him various items lying around so that he can use them to disarm the bomb.  Except he would get distracted in personal discussions with the folks with him and time would run out and they'd all blow up.  There was amusement to be found in the ways in which the prisoners, with time nearly gone, would still be arguing about petty personal differences.The movie has a scene like this...but it also has scene after scene of mind-numbing stupidity.  The skits gave us an idea that MacGruber is not the sharpest tool in the shed.  In the film, he is a total idiot.  Why There is talk of what a heroic guy he once was, but as Forte presents him, he's barely got two IQ points to rub together, and he truly accomplishes next to nothing (except when he's running around with a celery stalk sticking out of his bare bottom...don't ask).I expected the film to be quite silly and stupid...but I was hoping for a guilty pleasure and perhaps a laugh or two.  Yes, I did laugh on occasion, but the gags are repetitive, and the humor digs lower and lower.  It's tough to offend me...truly.  But I found the foul language and graphic sexual language in particular to be so contemptibly stupid and misogynistic and un-funny as to make me nearly groan out loud.  (Yes, this implies that if the humor were funny, I'd tolerate misogyny...but I'd hate myself for it.)  When MacGruber is told he can no longer ""be on the case"", he begs for his job back promising to do the most loathsome things to his boss (Powers Boothe).  If this happened one time, it might be funny...but the film goes back to that same well a few times, with increasingly poor results.Will Forte, in his SNL days, was capable of some truly funny stuff.  MacGruber was one character he did well.  The senate candidate with the whispery speaking voice was another.  But in feature films, and even as a recurring regular on 30 ROCK, he is thunderingly unfunny.  Poor Kristen Wiig appeared in this film before her breakout role in BRIDESMAIDS.  While she's always been happy to debase herself for the sake of a laugh, I hope she never has to stoop this low again.  Ryan Philippe is actually in this, as a young soldier who is enlisted to help MacGruber, and he looks totally embarrassed to be in the film, as he should be.  He's given nothing to do (except he does get to trot out the celery stalk gag himself).  And Powers Boothe has never looked less comfortable.  Val Kilmer seems pleased with himself the whole time...he got a nice paycheck and didn't even have to leave his resident state of New Mexico for the filming.That's the only reason I give this piece of junk two stars instead of one.

I was pleasantly surprised, though, at just how funny the film was.The DVD helpfully offers an unrated version, which is the one I watched. Rivaling THE BIG LEBOWSKI in F-word usage, MACGRUBER sidesteps the longtime issue of expanding SNL sketches to feature length by ignoring the 30-second conceit (tight spot/Mac fails/explosion). Instead, it sets its sights on the overripe-for-parody 80's oeveur of Tony Scott, a director who never failed to overproduce (BEVERLY HILLS COP 2, CRIMSON TIDE, et al), and whose films have aged about as well as SAVED BY THE BELL episodes. When the soundtrack swells and it's Macgruber himself playing the saxophone solo (aping the Conan dude from the beginning of LOST BOYS), you know you're in for an ode to excess.One of the admirable things about this film was their avoidance of a technique I think many of us were sick of after just one AUSTIN POWERS movie--the dropping of a cornball line and then awkward silence to telegraph that yes, the makers of the movie KNOW it wasn't funny, and isn't that itself funny? MACGRUBER, uneven at times, at least drops its bombs (or homemade C4, if you will) and keeps chuggin' along.Give it a shot, don't let the kids watch, and stick to the unrated version, unless F-bombs make you squeamish (and let's be honest, if they do you probably need to be looking for new Sandra Bullock schlock).",4,Much Funnier Than You Were Led To Believe...,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,1507,"['MACGRUBER', 'laid', 'big', 'egg', 'theaters', 'summer', 'was', 'rushed', 'DVD', 'pace', 'would', 'naturally', 'make', 'potential', 'viewer', 'skeptical', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'though', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'film', 'was.The', 'DVD', 'helpfully', 'unrated', 'version', 'one', 'watched', 'Rivaling', 'BIG', 'LEBOWSKI', 'F-word', 'usage', 'MACGRUBER', 'longtime', 'issue', 'expanding', 'SNL', 'sketches', 'feature', 'length', 'ignoring', '30-second', 'conceit', 'tight', 'spot/Mac', 'fails/explosion', 'Instead', 'sights', 'overripe-for-parody', '80', 'oeveur', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'director', 'who', 'never', 'failed', 'overproduce', 'BEVERLY', 'HILLS', 'COP', '2', 'CRIMSON', 'TIDE', 'et', 'al', 'films', 'have', 'aged', 'as', 'well', 'SAVED', 'BY', 'THE', 'BELL', 'episodes', 'When', 'soundtrack', 'swells', 'Macgruber', 'playing', 'saxophone', 'solo', 'aping', 'Conan', 'dude', 'beginning', 'LOST', 'BOYS', 'know', ""'re"", 'ode', 'excess.One', 'admirable', 'things', 'film', 'was', 'avoidance', 'technique', 'think', 'many', 'were', 'sick', 'just', 'one', 'AUSTIN', 'POWERS', 'movie', 'dropping', 'cornball', 'line', 'then', 'awkward', 'silence', 'telegraph', 'yes', 'makers', 'movie', 'KNOW', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', ""n't"", 'funny', 'MACGRUBER', 'uneven', 'times', 'least', 'drops', 'bombs', 'homemade', 'C4', 'will', 'chuggin', 'along.Give', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'stick', 'unrated', 'version', 'F-bombs', 'make', 'squeamish', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'do', 'probably', 'need', 'be', 'looking', 'new', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'schlock']",N/A

An ""Airplane"" wasn't a classic film, but its makers knew the cliches of the genre it was spoofing quite well; its jokes were therefore on-target.  Symptoms of malaise were already emerging however, with a few tasteless jokes erupting like an infection.Decades later, cheap parodies have become a genre of their own, with a ratio of tasteless jokes to witty ones reaching 100:0.  ""MacGruber"" is a typical bottom-feeder.  It's a big-screen adaptation of an SNL skit - reason enough to stay away - which plumbs the depths of ugly, puerile putrescence.Like other bad parodies, its makers have little grasp of or appreciation for the subject being spoofed.  Will Forte's character looks like TV's ""MacGyver,"" but acts like yet another tiresome version of the macho action film hero.  That comedic vein has been mined out.  There's little use of the TV material which audiences laughed at over the years: MacGyver's ludicrous ingenuity.  Lacking ingenuity of their own, ""MacGruber's"" writers resorted to grossing out the audience throughout the film.Another SNL performer deserves faint praise; Kristen Wiig is very mildly amusing as a long-suffering girl Friday.Along with other poorly-done entries in its genre, political pundit shows, and reality TV, ""MacGruber"" deserves to be preserved in a time capsule for future anthropologists to study.
