775193,A3I8OURC83NM6V,B0000CBXYO,"Christopher M. Fulton ""Purveyor of Truth""","[16, 20]","This was a very well done documentary on the history of the Dead Sea Scrolls.  It was fascinating to see where the scrolls are held on display to the public, some of the behind the scenes of repairing and maintaining the scrolls, as well as a brief history of how they were found.  This is highly recommended as it is done sort of Dragnet style, 'just the facts'.",5,Insightful,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,363,"['was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'history', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'Scrolls', 'was', 'fascinating', 'see', 'where', 'scrolls', 'are', 'held', 'display', 'public', 'scenes', 'repairing', 'maintaining', 'scrolls', 'as', 'well', 'brief', 'history', 'how', 'were', 'found', 'highly', 'recommended', 'done', 'sort', 'Dragnet', 'style', 'facts']",N/A

Science confirms the authenticity of the texts written more than 2000 years ago by the Essenes sect. The documentary stays away from controversy by sticking to the science & the generally accepted dogma on the texts.
