I'm a big Gov't Mule fan, and was excited about watching this documentary.  The CD in question was really a momentous event - 25 incredible bassists gathered for one recording, to honor the memory of Allen Woody.  The fact that these sessions were filmed is really cool - they could have just issued that, and I'd have given it 5 stars.  And then to include backstage insider footage of the band and some Gov't Mule performance footage - it's a no-brainer.  It'd be pretty hard to torpedo that combination.  Enter Mike Gordon.  For my taste, his incoherent, rambling ""commentary"" did little to illuminate the subject matter; the most up-beat thing I can say is that it subtracted from the time that could have been spent showing footage from the sessions.  I mean, how necessary was the ""aura-cam""?  Gordon would have served his role as the director better had he used his experience as a bassist to ask insightful and/or meaningful questions of legends like John Entwistle, Chris Squire, Larry Graham, Oteil, Flea, Roger Glover, Phil Lesh, Jack Casady, etc., rather than including the occasional teasing snippet of an interview, then committing to film apparently EVERY thought that entered his head during the film.  One of the other reviewers made a more generous assessment, then said something to the effect that, oh well, it's all for Allen Woody.  I agree whole-heartedly, which is why I'm so irked that ego-maniacal Mike Gordon decided to put himself at the center of the show.

It's about a bass player, playing bass.  It's about Allen Woody, a bass player.  It's about honoring a man who was influenced by and influence other bass players.  Stop complaining, and enjoy the message - this guy was loved by so many, they got together to make a tribute to him, and they talk about it here.

719756,A2BOXYJTA14TTL,B00006L921,"M. Best ""Zackariah""","[24, 26]","I purchased this video hoping to get some footage of Gov't Mule in concert.  The only material I had previously, was a DVD about Robert Johnson's legacy entitled, &quot;Hellhounds on my Trail&quot;, which included the band performing only one song.  But, instead of a concert, I got a very entertaining documentary focused on the making of the &quot;Deep End&quot; series that included substantial commentary on the founding member of Gov't Mule, the late Allen Woody.  There were only &quot;parts&quot; of songs being performed by the band with guest bassists sitting in.  These guests included some of the truly great bass players ranging from classic rock bands, to today's current trendsetters.  The magnificent Jack Bruce, Hendrix veteran, Billy Cox, Roger Glover from Deep Purple, and, ironically, the recently diseased John Entswistle is shown in a number of soundbites.  Of course, the director is the bassist from Phish, and he is very well in evidence thoughout the video, maybe a little more than is necessary.  I really would have enjoyed a little more of the legendary artists that were present.  A few minutes with Jack Bruce would have been wonderful, but he was barely seen.Regardless of what I wish had been here, what is here is wonderful to watch, somewhat instructive to the art, and adds to the list of videos that show &quot;some&quot; of Gov't Mule in action.  Warren Haynes is the most exciting guitarist to come upon the scene since Stevie Ray!  He has the finese of Duane Allman, the &quot;thick presence&quot; sound of Paul Kossoff, the creative riff punctuation of Hendrix, and the sheer power that Stevie R. Vaughn displayed.  He has the potential to contribute more to the art of lead guitar than even Page &amp; Beck have to this point.  Only the charisma of Clapton, himself, seems to be beyond the reach of this young phenomena!  He has said that the Mule will add another permenant bassist soon, and carry on as they had begun.  I hope so!  The material in this video, and on their recorded work to date, indicate that the future of blues-rock music may well be written in the annuals of this band, by this marvelous master of six-string wizardry!",4,Rising STAR!,1048204800,"03 21, 2003",2003,2181,"['purchased', 'video', 'hoping', 'get', 'footage', ""Gov't"", 'Mule', 'concert', 'only', 'material', 'had', 'previously', 'was', 'DVD', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'legacy', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Trail', 'quot', 'included', 'band', 'performing', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'instead', 'concert', 'got', 'very', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'focused', 'making', 'quot', 'Deep', 'End', 'quot', 'series', 'included', 'substantial', 'commentary', 'founding', 'member', ""Gov't"", 'Mule', 'late', 'Allen', 'Woody', 'were', 'only', 'quot', 'parts', 'quot', 'songs', 'being', 'performed', 'band', 'guest', 'bassists', 'sitting', 'guests', 'included', 'truly', 'great', 'bass', 'players', 'ranging', 'classic', 'rock', 'bands', 'today', 'current', 'trendsetters', 'magnificent', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'Hendrix', 'veteran', 'Billy', 'Cox', 'Roger', 'Glover', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'ironically', 'recently', 'diseased', 'John', 'Entswistle', 'shown', 'number', 'soundbites', 'course', 'director', 'bassist', 'Phish', 'very', 'well', 'evidence', 'video', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'necessary', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'more', 'legendary', 'artists', 'were', 'present', 'few', 'minutes', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'was', 'barely', 'seen.Regardless', 'what', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'here', 'what', 'here', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'somewhat', 'instructive', 'art', 'list', 'videos', 'show', 'quot', 'quot', ""Gov't"", 'Mule', 'action', 'Warren', 'Haynes', 'most', 'exciting', 'guitarist', 'come', 'scene', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'finese', 'Duane', 'Allman', 'quot', 'presence', 'quot', 'sound', 'Paul', 'Kossoff', 'creative', 'riff', 'punctuation', 'Hendrix', 'sheer', 'power', 'Stevie', 'R.', 'Vaughn', 'displayed', 'potential', 'contribute', 'more', 'art', 'lead', 'guitar', 'even', 'Page', 'amp', 'Beck', 'have', 'point', 'Only', 'charisma', 'Clapton', 'be', 'reach', 'young', 'phenomena', 'said', 'Mule', 'will', 'add', 'permenant', 'bassist', 'soon', 'carry', 'had', 'begun', 'hope', 'so', 'material', 'video', 'recorded', 'work', 'date', 'indicate', 'future', 'blues-rock', 'music', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'written', 'annuals', 'band', 'marvelous', 'master', 'six-string', 'wizardry']",N/A
