1672239,A1H4X50VE4K2W6,B00FNPQW2W,"A. D. Bowman ""64panther""","[0, 0]","Many Rivers To Cross is an impressive and well presented documentary that is well worth the investment and time. There are so many points covered in the allotted time of ( just under six hours ) , that it would be unrealistic to think that all of the subjects could be covered comprehensively. For example, the period covering the years 1865 - 1892, was without question, one of the harshest periods for blacks in the U. S., but for time restraint issues or whatever, hardly any time is devoted to the Reconstruction Period. The six hours zip by rather swiftly as Mr. Gates, acting as your tour guide, gets to spend a substantial amount of time on camera, taking the viewer to the sites of many of the events depicted. For what it's worth, the entirety of this offering is commendable, the historians that are interviewed offers insights into most of the subjects, unfortunately, many of those who were there to live and be a part of these events ( with the exception of John Lewis and Denise Nash ) are no longer around. This in essence is what I would term or refer to as a sampler, small morsels assembled to highlight some major periods of American History that simply could not be found in the class room of any school I knew of. There are many volumes available today that delve deeper and offer a more lengthy and comprehensive overview of Black History, from &#34; Africans In America, Reconstruction, The Second Civil War, Freedom Riders up to and including the very best of them all, Eyes On The Prize&#34;. These would be the ones I would recommend for those who are seriously interested in the knowledge and insight these pieces offer. It is sad to admit, that there are fewer numbers now interested in the plight and history of the black struggle in America and it is rewarding to see something like this come along. On the whole, this was a wonderful effort ( oh, and I loved that vintage automobile being driven during the show, a Packard ? ). For all the struggles and rivers and bridges that have been crossed, don't deceive yourself into thinking you've reached the promised land, but watching this film and others like it ( Voices Of Civil Rights ) gives one hope that we have indeed come a great distance, but by no means have we put the last river or bridge behind us. This is a must have for as Adam Clayton Powell once said, &#34; Not just for black Americans, but for all Americans interested in democracy &#34;, and on that, I totally agree",4,"Many Behind, Many Ahead...",1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,2465,"['Many', 'Rivers', 'Cross', 'impressive', 'well', 'presented', 'documentary', 'well', 'investment', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'points', 'covered', 'allotted', 'time', 'just', 'six', 'hours', 'would', 'be', 'unrealistic', 'think', 'subjects', 'could', 'be', 'covered', 'comprehensively', 'example', 'period', 'covering', 'years', '1865', '1892', 'was', 'question', 'one', 'harshest', 'periods', 'blacks', 'U.', 'S.', 'time', 'restraint', 'issues', 'whatever', 'hardly', 'time', 'devoted', 'Reconstruction', 'Period', 'six', 'hours', 'zip', 'rather', 'swiftly', 'Mr.', 'Gates', 'acting', 'tour', 'guide', 'spend', 'substantial', 'amount', 'time', 'camera', 'taking', 'viewer', 'sites', 'many', 'events', 'depicted', 'what', 'worth', 'entirety', 'offering', 'commendable', 'historians', 'are', 'interviewed', 'offers', 'insights', 'most', 'subjects', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'live', 'be', 'part', 'events', 'exception', 'John', 'Lewis', 'Denise', 'Nash', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'around', 'essence', 'what', 'would', 'term', 'refer', 'sampler', 'small', 'morsels', 'assembled', 'highlight', 'major', 'periods', 'American', 'History', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'class', 'room', 'school', 'knew', 'are', 'many', 'volumes', 'available', 'today', 'deeper', 'offer', 'more', 'lengthy', 'comprehensive', 'overview', 'Black', 'History', '34', 'Africans', 'America', 'Reconstruction', 'Second', 'Civil', 'War', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'up', 'including', 'very', 'best', 'Eyes', 'Prize', '34', 'would', 'be', 'ones', 'would', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'seriously', 'interested', 'knowledge', 'insight', 'pieces', 'offer', 'sad', 'admit', 'are', 'fewer', 'numbers', 'now', 'interested', 'plight', 'history', 'black', 'struggle', 'America', 'rewarding', 'see', 'something', 'come', 'along', 'whole', 'was', 'wonderful', 'effort', 'oh', 'loved', 'vintage', 'automobile', 'being', 'driven', 'show', 'Packard', 'struggles', 'rivers', 'bridges', 'have', 'been', 'crossed', 'do', ""n't"", 'deceive', 'thinking', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'promised', 'land', 'watching', 'film', 'others', 'Voices', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'one', 'hope', 'have', 'indeed', 'come', 'great', 'distance', 'means', 'have', 'put', 'last', 'river', 'bridge', 'must', 'have', 'Adam', 'Clayton', 'Powell', 'once', 'said', '34', 'Not', 'just', 'black', 'Americans', 'Americans', 'interested', 'democracy', '34', 'totally', 'agree']",African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross

1672245,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B00FNPQW2W,Dwight,"[3, 13]","The first episode isn't necessarily worth purchasing.  It tells us that originally slavery was not racist and the first African Americans worked and travelled with Europeans.  Then the Whites took away property rights from African American landowners ....The first episode is worth purchasing for Dr. Gates' face when he listens to white people talk about slavery.  It is very painful and remember that Dr. Gates previously hosted the geneology series where he traced the ancestry of many American celebrities including YoYo Ma which echoed the tolerance and graciousness and kindness I have experienced from African Americans when they complimented me on my Chinese background especially the retention of our language.  This is painful when I remember my parents watching Roots when it first aired on television and we learned that African Americans were denied their names and heritage which preceded the exact same violent erasure that the Japanese invaders enforced on the Corean people.It's interesting that Princess Diana is descended from George Washington who owned slaves and I think it indicates more an aristocratic breaking away from the King of England's control to form one's own serfdom that refuses to kickback to the English rather than some miraculous high ideal of human rights - that's why the POTUSes of yore owned slaves.  There's no cult of George Washington the way there is for Abe Lincoln.The use of enslaved African Americans to supplant Native American populations echoes the utilization by the British colonialists of Indians and Nepalese over native or local Chinese in Asia.  From Chinese accounts, there was no sympathy for the Chinese by the Indian and Nepalese who relished having power over the Chinese - it made them feel better about the British.  That also may be why the Koreans lower soldiers were reported by local Chinese and Western POWs as being brutal and seeking the opportunity to strike at the Chinese and Western POWs while the Koreans themselves were being wronged by the Japanese.The racist caricatures are worse than what I have seen inCrying Freeman, Vol. 1 (v. 1)andSanctuary (Volume 1)- there is an ugly cruel GLOATING over the situation of the African slaves and a resentment that some of them are freed.  And these people go to Church?  I'm not a Christian but I went to Catholic school for more than a decade so I know they KNOW better and these cartoons are ....The promise of the first episode was followed by a very good second episode.  After reading Russell Shorto'sAmsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal Cityand how the Dutch needed a lie to invade England (more a German and Japanese thing than a straightforward no apologies Viking thing, nu?), I am wondering if the following episodes will give us any clues about whether the American CIVIL war was actually a war agains the European ARISTOCRATS including England's desire to use the fertile Southern cotton planting states as overseas cash cows placing operatives as the plantation and slave owners so it wouldn't matter how many good Americans freed slaves, England would always ship more.  England controlled the shipping of the African Americans to the Americas.  They may not have had their fingerprints on the whips and chains and the bodies of the African women but they were responsible - something they don't mention inLove Actuallyand maybe that is why Cary Elwes was cast inKiss The Girlswhich used slave quarters in the South as the setting.  It would illuminate the whole Simon Murray Sino-Forrest connection as well.  And it means Abe Lincoln would never survive besting America's OLDEST enemy as they were called inThe Snuke.  I wished they had faked his death because it is an intolerable thing to learn that this president was murdered but you do get to see an indirect descendant playing a desk clerk inTo Hell....  Any echo is a comfort.How does that song go in ""Whale Wars""?""The world is a vampire ....""Track the crimes - not just provide financial compensation to the victims - so that we can see who is responsible for this and they can be stopped once and for all.",4,The second episode is more informative.
