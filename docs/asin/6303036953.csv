Donald Duck is there camping out, as is Goofy, and the sight of him water skiing is worth the price of the video.  (He's actually quite good!!!)Then there are the songs - many from years before, such as ""The Caissons Go Marching Along,"" ""Don't Fence Me In,"" ""Mountain Greenery,"" and when the dancers do ""Turkey in the Straw,"" it's a real hoot, and our two twin girls want to get up and dance and dance and dance....A terrific addition to any collection!!!",5,Let's go Camping!!!,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,829,"[""'re"", 'going', 'camping', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'songs', 'fun', 'dancing', 'excitement', 'rest.This', 'video', 'ranks', 'high', 'there', 'live', 'action', 'ones', 'what', 'Sing', 'Along', 'gang', 'joining', 'Mickey', 'Minnie', 'Goofy', 'Chip', 'Dale', 'others', 'fun', 'fest', 'tour', 'many', 'sights', 'Discovery', 'Island', 'River', 'Country', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'there', 'camping', 'out', 'Goofy', 'sight', 'water', 'skiing', 'price', 'video', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Then', 'are', 'songs', 'many', 'years', 'before', 'such', 'Caissons', 'Go', 'Marching', 'Along', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Fence', 'Me', 'Mountain', 'Greenery', 'when', 'dancers', 'do', 'Turkey', 'Straw', 'real', 'hoot', 'two', 'twin', 'girls', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'dance', 'dance', 'dance', '.A', 'terrific', 'addition', 'collection']",N/A
