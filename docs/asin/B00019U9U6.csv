797183,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00019U9U6,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[37, 37]","I was hesitant to try this video at first given that I had seen it rated as ""advanced""--although I had been doing yoga for over two years when I first tried this practice, I still considered myself to be at an intermediate level at most. While I definitely found this workout to be challenging, as it says on the cover, it really is appropriate for all levels of yoga students. Baron Baptiste is an excellent, down-to-earth instructor who moves around the class offering pointers, tips, and modifications to his students. He repeatedly emphasizes the importance of going at your own pace, and he calls out frequent instructions to beginners (e.g. ""those new to the class, do this...""). The video would not be appropriate for those completely new to yoga, as it assumes basic familiarity with the poses, both the majority of the poses are accessible to beginners/intermediates.  Although Baron does include a few more challenging moves--eg, crow and wheel pose--he pushes his student only to go to their ""edge,"" never further. In addition, Baron is quite encouraging and completely non-intimidating as he praises his students for working to the best of their abilities.The practice moves along at a steady pace, but it was much easier to follow than some of the other lightning-fast vinyasa-style workouts I've tried. My one complaint about the video was that it moved too quickly was during the practice of crow pose: Baron offered excellent guidelines for how those new to this pose (like myself) could work their way into it, but he moved so quickly into the next pose that I didn't have the opportunity to practice his suggestions. In other instances, however, I was able to attain some difficult poses that I had never managed before, such as reverse triangle. This is definitely a rigorous workout that will cause you to work up a sweat; I found that the sun sequences at the beginning of the practice really challenged my endurance, particularly given the frequent repetitions of downward-facing dog held for extended periods. I still use this video on days when I want an exciting, energetic, and challenging yoga practice.",5,Vigorous vinyasa practice led by an excellent instructor,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,2130,"['was', 'hesitant', 'try', 'video', 'first', 'given', 'had', 'seen', 'rated', 'advanced', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'two', 'years', 'when', 'first', 'tried', 'practice', 'still', 'considered', 'be', 'intermediate', 'level', 'most', 'definitely', 'found', 'workout', 'be', 'challenging', 'cover', 'really', 'appropriate', 'levels', 'yoga', 'students', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'excellent', 'down-to-earth', 'instructor', 'who', 'class', 'offering', 'pointers', 'tips', 'modifications', 'students', 'repeatedly', 'importance', 'going', 'own', 'pace', 'out', 'frequent', 'instructions', 'beginners', 'e.g', 'new', 'class', 'do', 'video', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'appropriate', 'completely', 'new', 'yoga', 'basic', 'familiarity', 'poses', 'majority', 'poses', 'are', 'accessible', 'beginners/intermediates', 'Baron', 'include', 'few', 'more', 'challenging', 'moves', 'eg', 'crow', 'wheel', 'pose', 'student', 'only', 'go', 'edge', 'never', 'further', 'addition', 'Baron', 'quite', 'encouraging', 'completely', 'non-intimidating', 'students', 'working', 'best', 'abilities.The', 'practice', 'moves', 'along', 'steady', 'pace', 'was', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'other', 'lightning-fast', 'vinyasa-style', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'one', 'complaint', 'video', 'was', 'moved', 'too', 'quickly', 'was', 'practice', 'crow', 'pose', 'Baron', 'offered', 'excellent', 'guidelines', 'how', 'new', 'pose', 'could', 'work', 'way', 'moved', 'so', 'quickly', 'next', 'pose', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'opportunity', 'practice', 'suggestions', 'other', 'instances', 'however', 'was', 'able', 'attain', 'difficult', 'poses', 'had', 'never', 'managed', 'before', 'such', 'reverse', 'triangle', 'definitely', 'rigorous', 'workout', 'will', 'cause', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'found', 'sun', 'sequences', 'beginning', 'practice', 'really', 'challenged', 'endurance', 'particularly', 'given', 'frequent', 'repetitions', 'downward-facing', 'dog', 'held', 'extended', 'periods', 'still', 'use', 'video', 'days', 'when', 'want', 'exciting', 'energetic', 'challenging', 'yoga', 'practice']",N/A
797184,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B00019U9U6,Colleen M. Schneider,"[1, 2]","I tried this on a loan from the library.  This is my first Baron Baptiste dvd and I was pleasantly surprised with how good it is.  Here are the likes/dislikes:The dvd has very good instruction and helpful cuing on how to modify poses.  Though it states on the box the workout is  good for beginner and all levels, I would say it is aimed at an intermediate exerciser with modifications that would allow you to do the workout if you were a beginner, not the other way around.  It is obvious that the people in this class are not beginners to yoga and are very toned and flexible.  The workout is more of a live classroom style, and there are many people doing yoga.  This is good and bad.  Good, that you see the many variations and the modifications and what some of them due to make a pose more challenging, but bad in that it seemed a little distracting for me personally.  The music is a light chanting style and I found it soothing and relaxing and completely fitting.My dislikes-the large class setting I felt was a little more distracting for me.  I prefer either one-on-one or with a small class, that is just personal though.  He also talks more than I would like.  Though most of the talking is describing form, it seems a lot of it is just to fill in space and I feel fine with just listening to the music and doing the asanas without all the talking.  I enjoyed the poses, all of which I have done with many of my other dvds (Brian Kest, Alan Finger, Sara Ivanhoe, Shiva Rea, are some of my go-tos).  I especially liked that he did the camel pose, which I find is somehow not as popular as many of the other poses, but that I find really opens up my chest and back and relaxes me.As I have only tried this one dvd by Baron Baptiste I can't rate him against previous dvds but will say that I would be interested in trying some of his other dvds.  Though I don't feel like I would purchase this one, I may check it out again sometime to practice with it and felt the dvd had good instruction and an excellent practice.Overall, a good dvd in a live class setting. You will get a nice practice in the nearly 1 hour workout.",4,A good yoga dvd with modifications for the beginner....,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,2130,"['tried', 'loan', 'library', 'first', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'dvd', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'Here', 'are', 'likes/dislikes', 'dvd', 'very', 'good', 'instruction', 'helpful', 'cuing', 'how', 'modify', 'poses', 'box', 'workout', 'good', 'beginner', 'levels', 'would', 'say', 'aimed', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'modifications', 'would', 'allow', 'do', 'workout', 'were', 'beginner', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'obvious', 'people', 'class', 'are', 'not', 'beginners', 'yoga', 'are', 'very', 'toned', 'flexible', 'workout', 'more', 'live', 'classroom', 'style', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'doing', 'yoga', 'good', 'bad', 'Good', 'see', 'many', 'variations', 'modifications', 'what', 'due', 'make', 'pose', 'more', 'challenging', 'bad', 'seemed', 'little', 'distracting', 'personally', 'music', 'light', 'chanting', 'style', 'found', 'soothing', 'relaxing', 'completely', 'fitting.My', 'dislikes-the', 'large', 'class', 'setting', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'distracting', 'prefer', 'one-on-one', 'small', 'class', 'just', 'personal', 'though', 'also', 'more', 'would', 'like', 'most', 'talking', 'describing', 'form', 'lot', 'just', 'fill', 'space', 'feel', 'fine', 'just', 'listening', 'music', 'doing', 'asanas', 'talking', 'enjoyed', 'poses', 'have', 'done', 'many', 'other', 'dvds', 'Brian', 'Kest', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'are', 'go-tos', 'especially', 'liked', 'did', 'camel', 'pose', 'find', 'somehow', 'not', 'as', 'popular', 'many', 'other', 'poses', 'find', 'really', 'up', 'chest', 'back', 'relaxes', 'me.As', 'have', 'only', 'tried', 'one', 'dvd', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rate', 'previous', 'dvds', 'will', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'trying', 'other', 'dvds', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'would', 'purchase', 'one', 'may', 'check', 'out', 'again', 'sometime', 'practice', 'felt', 'dvd', 'had', 'good', 'instruction', 'excellent', 'practice.Overall', 'good', 'dvd', 'live', 'class', 'setting', 'will', 'get', 'nice', 'practice', 'nearly', '1', 'hour', 'workout']",N/A
797185,A3J20HDHEMAS4U,B00019U9U6,Michael,"[13, 15]","The Good: The moderate pace keeps you in some poses for a while, adding a nice challenge to the practice. Real students demonstrate pose modification. At about and hour, the workout is pretty good for beginners and some intermediates.The Bad: The shaky camera work bothered me as I watched to get prepped for the practice. Baptiste doesn't always call out poses, and unnervingly never stops talking. The flow feels stunted at times, as some simpler poses take just too long to get into.The Verdict: Baptist, like Kest, delivers a good workout-though one full of chatter and silly euphemisms (""Angels fly because they take themselves lightly""). You'll get a good workout, though I doubt you'll feel calm and refreshed after listening to Baptiste's non-stop commentary.Full Review: Baptiste holds a real, in-classroom yoga practice. The variety of students range from somewhat-new to experienced, though most are pretty toned. Baptiste introduces a decent variety of poses, and the flow is moderate to slow. During the practice, he uses constant commentary, and a ""hands on"" approach with his students-something not everyone will appreciate. He doesn't consistently call out the poses by name, something that bothered me as I tried to keep the flow going without looking at the screen.On the plus side, he does present modifications for poses-something beginners will appreciate. Moving into some basic poses seemed to take much longer than necessary, stunting the flow. The workout starts slow with some salutations, moves on to some strength and balancing poses, some back-bends, and finishes up with a (disappointingly) brief hip-opener section.If your considering this video, I suggest you borrow it from the library first. While I had high expectations, there really wasn't anything new here. Your going to have to gauge whether Baptiste's voice will wear on you, since you hear it constantly. For now, I'll keep working with Rodney Yee-who's videos leave me feeling like I should after a practice: clear, calm, and refreshed.",3,"Baptiste: Decent workout, but too chatty to leave you calm.",1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,2029,"['Good', 'moderate', 'pace', 'keeps', 'poses', 'while', 'adding', 'nice', 'challenge', 'practice', 'Real', 'students', 'demonstrate', 'pose', 'modification', 'hour', 'workout', 'pretty', 'good', 'beginners', 'intermediates.The', 'Bad', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'bothered', 'watched', 'get', 'prepped', 'practice', 'Baptiste', ""n't"", 'always', 'call', 'out', 'poses', 'unnervingly', 'never', 'talking', 'flow', 'feels', 'stunted', 'times', 'simpler', 'poses', 'take', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'into.The', 'Verdict', 'Baptist', 'Kest', 'good', 'workout-though', 'one', 'full', 'chatter', 'silly', 'euphemisms', 'Angels', 'fly', 'take', 'lightly', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'calm', 'refreshed', 'listening', 'Baptiste', 'non-stop', 'commentary.Full', 'Review', 'Baptiste', 'real', 'in-classroom', 'yoga', 'practice', 'variety', 'students', 'range', 'somewhat-new', 'experienced', 'most', 'are', 'pretty', 'toned', 'Baptiste', 'decent', 'variety', 'poses', 'flow', 'moderate', 'slow', 'practice', 'constant', 'commentary', 'hands', 'approach', 'students-something', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'appreciate', ""n't"", 'consistently', 'call', 'out', 'poses', 'name', 'something', 'bothered', 'tried', 'keep', 'flow', 'going', 'looking', 'screen.On', 'plus', 'side', 'present', 'modifications', 'poses-something', 'beginners', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Moving', 'basic', 'poses', 'seemed', 'take', 'much', 'longer', 'necessary', 'stunting', 'flow', 'workout', 'slow', 'salutations', 'moves', 'strength', 'balancing', 'poses', 'back-bends', 'up', 'disappointingly', 'brief', 'hip-opener', 'section.If', 'considering', 'video', 'suggest', 'borrow', 'library', 'first', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'here', 'going', 'have', 'gauge', 'Baptiste', 'voice', 'will', 'wear', 'hear', 'constantly', 'now', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'working', 'Rodney', 'Yee-who', 'videos', 'leave', 'feeling', 'should', 'practice', 'clear', 'calm', 'refreshed']",N/A

797188,A1B86N6Q9NO5QU,B00019U9U6,Vou's Reviews,"[1, 2]","... the DVD definitely has the feel of a live (if somewhat overcrowded) class. The lesson itself is approximately 50 minutes and follows what regularly practicing yogis will recognize as a fairly standard mid-level-challenge routine.From a thorough warm up through to a variety of stretches, balances, twists and strength asanas BB manages to fit so much into the class that by the end of it you feel that every inch of your body has been involved. It's not a particularly tough class in terms of which poses have been included or even the speed of transition, but to get the absolute most out of it (and yourself) requires non-stop mental and physical concentration ... and it's up to you how much you make of that.BB is quite the chatterer, most of it instruction but also a fair amount of inspirational (and some will argue clich&eacute;d) quotes. Does that bother you? Why? Just focus on what you're doing and let the words wash over you. Focus on the instruction (which is good and, if you've watched once to get familiar with BB's techniques regarding the translation of words to movement, allows you to get through the whole class without looking up), your breath and your pose, you'll feel fabulous at the end of this total body and mind encompassing yoga session.The poses are well demonstrated by class members and BB moves around praising and adjusting yogis in a manner that they appear to appreciate and, because he's adjusting common alignment and placement mistakes, is actually very helpful to the DVD viewer too.  The room is quite solidly packed so you could watch the DVD a couple of times to identify individuals at levels you can relate to. (I wouldn't want to be there myself, in some poses participants are actually moving into the space of another - but nobody seems to mind or be affected so perhaps this is to illustrate how a good yogi can focus inward, whatever the external distraction(?!))Sound quality is good. Visually some people may miss the beautiful scenery now so common in yoga DVDs but others will appreciate this very real feeling class atmosphere.BB is obviously an expert yogi, and appears to genuinely care about passing on his knowledge and helping and inspiring his class.",5,A relatively wide spectrum yoga workout for beginners and new-to-intermediates,1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,2217,"['DVD', 'definitely', 'feel', 'live', 'somewhat', 'overcrowded', 'class', 'lesson', 'approximately', '50', 'minutes', 'what', 'regularly', 'practicing', 'yogis', 'will', 'recognize', 'fairly', 'standard', 'mid-level-challenge', 'routine.From', 'thorough', 'warm', 'up', 'variety', 'stretches', 'balances', 'twists', 'strength', 'asanas', 'BB', 'fit', 'so', 'much', 'class', 'end', 'feel', 'inch', 'body', 'been', 'involved', 'not', 'particularly', 'tough', 'class', 'terms', 'poses', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'even', 'speed', 'transition', 'get', 'absolute', 'most', 'non-stop', 'mental', 'physical', 'concentration', 'up', 'how', 'much', 'make', 'that.BB', 'quite', 'chatterer', 'most', 'instruction', 'also', 'fair', 'amount', 'inspirational', 'will', 'argue', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'bother', 'Why', 'Just', 'focus', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'let', 'words', 'wash', 'Focus', 'instruction', 'good', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'once', 'get', 'familiar', 'BB', 'techniques', 'regarding', 'translation', 'words', 'movement', 'get', 'whole', 'class', 'looking', 'up', 'breath', 'pose', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'fabulous', 'end', 'total', 'body', 'mind', 'encompassing', 'session.The', 'poses', 'are', 'well', 'demonstrated', 'class', 'members', 'BB', 'praising', 'adjusting', 'yogis', 'manner', 'appear', 'appreciate', 'adjusting', 'common', 'alignment', 'placement', 'mistakes', 'actually', 'very', 'helpful', 'DVD', 'viewer', 'too', 'room', 'quite', 'solidly', 'packed', 'could', 'watch', 'DVD', 'couple', 'times', 'identify', 'individuals', 'levels', 'can', 'relate', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'poses', 'participants', 'are', 'actually', 'moving', 'space', 'nobody', 'mind', 'be', 'affected', 'so', 'perhaps', 'illustrate', 'how', 'good', 'yogi', 'can', 'focus', 'inward', 'external', 'distraction', 'Sound', 'quality', 'good', 'Visually', 'people', 'may', 'miss', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'now', 'so', 'common', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'others', 'will', 'appreciate', 'very', 'real', 'feeling', 'class', 'atmosphere.BB', 'obviously', 'expert', 'yogi', 'genuinely', 'care', 'passing', 'knowledge', 'helping', 'inspiring', 'class']",N/A
