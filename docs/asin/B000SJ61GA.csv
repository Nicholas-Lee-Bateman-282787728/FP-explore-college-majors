With that being said, I don't think this DVD does either of them justice. Oh, there's some funny material on this DVD but I would rather see an entire show or two rather than a few clips from here and a few from there.",2,"Far too short, far too editorialized",1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,311,"['Dean', 'Martin', 'was', 'great', 'entertainer', 'show', 'was', 'real', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'time', 'being', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'DVD', 'justice', 'Oh', 'funny', 'material', 'DVD', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'entire', 'show', 'two', 'rather', 'few', 'clips', 'here', 'few', 'there']",N/A
1086423,AUEAVIMGIHY80,B000SJ61GA,Jerry Block,"[0, 0]","I found this for 45c in the fire bin at a thrift shop in a bad neighborhood. It's worth every penny! Dean wings it with the usual suspects. On parade is the increasingly arthritic Establishment of show biz, putting a few more bucks in their pocket. I can imagine hippies at the time rolling their eyes at this shtick. Their square parents loved every minute of it. ""That Dom Deluise is a real card, Ethel."" ""Ho ho, that Jimmy Stewart floors me!"" What's really great is Dean's Vegas-cool persona. What a smooth operator. What a player! He's dragging on a cigarette and ogling the chicks and not giving a damn. He can't wait until it's over so he can hit the golf links. He's so charming and easy-to-take that he gets away with every flub and look at the clock. Some performers suffer for their art, but not THAT cat. (What's funny, though, is how his hair rug went gray all of a sudden.) Dino was the sort of all-around entertainer who puts today's half-baked TV hosts like Jay Leno, David Letterman, and Conan O'Brien to shame. Dean had talent and ability, not just hype on a billboard. Kind of wish he were still around to show those losers how it's done.",4,Get the cue cards ready!!,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,1156,"['found', '45c', 'fire', 'bin', 'thrift', 'shop', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'worth', 'penny', 'Dean', 'usual', 'suspects', 'parade', 'increasingly', 'arthritic', 'Establishment', 'show', 'biz', 'putting', 'few', 'more', 'bucks', 'pocket', 'can', 'imagine', 'hippies', 'time', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'shtick', 'square', 'parents', 'loved', 'minute', 'Dom', 'Deluise', 'real', 'card', 'Ethel', 'Ho', 'ho', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'floors', 'What', 'really', 'great', 'Dean', 'Vegas-cool', 'persona', 'What', 'smooth', 'operator', 'What', 'player', 'dragging', 'cigarette', 'ogling', 'chicks', 'not', 'giving', 'damn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'can', 'hit', 'golf', 'links', 'so', 'charming', 'easy-to-take', 'away', 'flub', 'look', 'clock', 'performers', 'suffer', 'art', 'not', 'THAT', 'cat', 'What', 'funny', 'though', 'how', 'hair', 'rug', 'went', 'gray', 'sudden', 'Dino', 'was', 'sort', 'all-around', 'entertainer', 'who', 'today', 'half-baked', 'TV', 'hosts', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'David', 'Letterman', 'Conan', ""O'Brien"", 'shame', 'Dean', 'had', 'talent', 'ability', 'not', 'just', 'hype', 'billboard', 'Kind', 'wish', 'were', 'still', 'show', 'losers', 'how', 'done']",N/A

""Take two"" is better!The viewer under 40 might not understand what the celebration is all about and might not find some of the ""70s Vegas Lounge"" banter appealing, but the material is still strong.Recently, a Dean Martin greatest hits CD went to Number One on a Billboard chart.

Rivers,"[5, 5]","Instead of releasing the ""Best of Dean"" TV special that aired on NBC in 1979, producer Greg Garrison inexplicably re-edited and shortened the original broadcast for this DVD compilation. What remains are some classic moments from Dino's 1965-74 variety show, but little of the context that made the 100-minute retrospective so memorable.
