""Red: Werewolf Hunter"" hovers somewhere in the middle -- a story that's compelling and some great acting from Felicia Day and Kavan Smith, but the werewolf hunters are inept and the werewolves don't have a lot of dimension beyond ""RAR! WE'RE EVIL!""FBI agent Virginia ""Red"" Sullivan (Day) brings her fiance Nathan (Smith) home to meet the family. Then a man is brutally murdered, and Nathan is injured while searching for the person -- or animal -- who did that to him. It's then that Virginia reveals everything: for centuries, her ancestors have been werewolf hunters -- and so is she.But now a new werewolf has come to town, promising the local lycanthropes that he'll teach them to shapeshift at will, not just when the moon is full. The plan to kill him becomes a lot more personal when Nathan turns out to have been bitten -- and the werewolf plans to kill or turn the whole Sullivan family.""Red: Werewolf Hunter"" is neither the worst nor the best werewolf flick I've ever seen. It has a nice atmosphere, mixing the gothic, wintry quality of a small town with leather coats, silver and harpoons. Yes, there is an actual scene where Felicia Day stands on a rooftop and harpoons werewolves. That is awesome.Unfortunately, both the werewolves and hunters are... not handled well. The hunters come across as inept, stumbling into obvious traps that seasoned werewolf hunters should have seen. And the werewolves are pretty 2-dimensional -- we never really see any of them being anything except bloodthirsty savages, and none of them have any doubts about what they're doing.Also, there is a HUGE continuity error late in the story. Without revealing too much, we're told that if they kill a werewolf who infected someone, the victim will be cured. And it DOESN'T HAPPEN.So what compensates for this? Well, the rather shocking ending, which adds a bittersweet note to everything that happened. It's more realistic and raw than I expected, and that's good.Also, the cast is quite solid -- Felicia Day is a bit weepy at times, but she's otherwise excellent as a buttkicking werewolf hunter, and Kavan Smith is a solid, believable FBI agent (although it was trippy to see Codex smooching Deputy Andy). And there's a round of great performances by Stephen McHattie, Rosemary Dunsmore and the sexy Greg Bryk.""Red: Werewolf Hunter"" could have used more fleshed-out werewolves and competent hunters, but as cheapo werewolf SyFy movies go, this is a decent one.",3,Red Shooting Hood (spoilers),1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,2518,"['Most', 'werewolf', 'stories', 'are', 'either', 'done', 'very', 'right', 'very', 'wrong', 'Red', 'Werewolf', 'Hunter', 'hovers', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'story', 'compelling', 'great', 'acting', 'Felicia', 'Day', 'Kavan', 'Smith', 'werewolf', 'hunters', 'are', 'inept', 'werewolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'dimension', 'RAR', 'WE', 'EVIL', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Virginia', 'Red', 'Sullivan', 'Day', 'fiance', 'Nathan', 'Smith', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'Then', 'man', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Nathan', 'injured', 'searching', 'person', 'animal', 'who', 'did', 'then', 'Virginia', 'reveals', 'everything', 'centuries', 'ancestors', 'have', 'been', 'werewolf', 'hunters', 'so', 'she.But', 'now', 'new', 'werewolf', 'come', 'town', 'promising', 'local', 'lycanthropes', ""'ll"", 'teach', 'shapeshift', 'will', 'not', 'just', 'when', 'moon', 'full', 'plan', 'kill', 'lot', 'more', 'personal', 'when', 'Nathan', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'bitten', 'werewolf', 'kill', 'turn', 'whole', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'Red', 'Werewolf', 'Hunter', 'worst', 'best', 'werewolf', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'nice', 'atmosphere', 'mixing', 'gothic', 'wintry', 'quality', 'small', 'town', 'leather', 'coats', 'silver', 'harpoons', 'Yes', 'actual', 'scene', 'where', 'Felicia', 'Day', 'rooftop', 'harpoons', 'werewolves', 'awesome.Unfortunately', 'werewolves', 'hunters', 'are', 'not', 'handled', 'well', 'hunters', 'come', 'inept', 'stumbling', 'obvious', 'traps', 'seasoned', 'werewolf', 'hunters', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'werewolves', 'are', 'pretty', '2-dimensional', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'being', 'anything', 'bloodthirsty', 'savages', 'none', 'have', 'doubts', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing.Also', 'HUGE', 'continuity', 'error', 'late', 'story', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', ""'re"", 'told', 'kill', 'werewolf', 'who', 'infected', 'someone', 'victim', 'will', 'be', 'cured', ""N'T"", 'HAPPEN.So', 'what', 'Well', 'rather', 'shocking', 'ending', 'bittersweet', 'note', 'everything', 'happened', 'more', 'realistic', 'raw', 'expected', 'good.Also', 'cast', 'quite', 'solid', 'Felicia', 'Day', 'bit', 'weepy', 'times', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'buttkicking', 'werewolf', 'hunter', 'Kavan', 'Smith', 'solid', 'believable', 'FBI', 'agent', 'was', 'trippy', 'see', 'Codex', 'smooching', 'Deputy', 'Andy', 'round', 'great', 'performances', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'Rosemary', 'Dunsmore', 'sexy', 'Greg', 'Bryk', 'Red', 'Werewolf', 'Hunter', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'fleshed-out', 'werewolves', 'competent', 'hunters', 'cheapo', 'werewolf', 'SyFy', 'movies', 'go', 'decent', 'one']",Red: Werewolf Hunter

I saw it has Felicia Day in it and I suddenly expected more. Yes, I really wanted this movie to be good.Although there are some scenes where she is undeniably hot, Felicia Day's talents were vastly under-used. She normally carries a story with her performance even without any kind of budget or special effects. Instead, her energy and acting ability only peek out here and there.This movie has some really good moments and pretty good effects. However, there were too many holes to really enjoy it. Some were caused by editing. Some were caused by weak-ass moves in the writing and/or directing.For instance, an experienced werewolf hunter has a werewolf in a jail cell and can't manage to kill it with three shots from a rifle (silver bullets) from five feet away. The werewolf is shaking the bars and the locked cell door just sort of swings open. Oh, come on!!!! I could have written that scene better with a few minutes of thought. ANYONE could!

One werewolf decides to break the truce and create a little fun sucking a little neck blood from a few people that strangely seem to show up out of nowhere. A couple members of the family and the boyfriend are in law enforcement, although you would never know it from their actions, especially in decision making and really especially in using weapons. Anyway all but one of the family die and the rogue werewolf and his minions also die via silver tools e.g. bullets, arrows, knives.

1503332,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005TG8156,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[13, 15]","Even geek goddesses sometimes phone it in. RED: WEREWOLF HUNTER is yet another take on Little Red Riding Hood. Except that, in terms of watchability, it's nowhere near the realm of THE COMPANY OF WOLVES or Reese Witherspoon's FREEWAY or even the animated parody HOODWINKED. At least in 2011's RED RIDING HOOD, one can commend Amanda Seyfried for her very good performance while damning the script that let her down. The highlight of RED: WEREWOLF HUNTER for me was ogling Felicia Day in her black leathers. RED: WEREWOLF HUNTER, a 2010 SyFy television horror feature, may fill you with dread, but, embarrassingly, not in the way the film intends. Ennui sets in pretty quickly.Virginia ""Red"" Sullivan (Day) is a modern-day descendant of Little Red Riding Hood. ""Red"" isn't a fond nickname as much as it is an honorific bestowed on the first-born daughter in each generation of a family of werewolf hunters. A truce exists between the Sullivan clan and the remaining werewolf packs. Providing the werewolves stay deep, deep in the woods, the Sullivans will desist from declaring it open season on lycanthropes. Still, the Sullivans aren't about to have a yard sale on black leather threads and their arsenal of silver weaponry.But then a rogue werewolf named Gabriel (Stephen McHattie) comes along and shatters the tentative peace. Although it's never really explained, Gabriel is a terrifying new breed that can phase at will, who isn't at all restrained by the lack of a full moon. Gabriel has seized leadership of the pack and now he's making a move on the Sullivans. Luckily for the humans, FBI agent Virginia Sullivan picked the perfect time to visit her family homestead. But she may regret bringing along her fiance, fellow federal agent Nathan Kessler (Kavan Smith). Some family secrets aren't meant to be shared.The cast's uniformly wet blanket acting is infectious; the movie, like its actors, immediately assumes a leaden monotone. I'm a big fan of Felicia Day and was surprised at how detached she seemed. There's no chemistry to ignite those scenes between her and Kavan Smith. In fact, more sparks fly from the combustible werewolves than from the two leads. It's ironic that Kavan Smith actually exhibits more soulfulness in his role of the robotic Deputy Andy in EUREKA. Anyway, I'm still getting used to the notion of Felicia Day as a steely action heroine. Her patented nerdy, gamine charm is pretty non-existent in this flick. Besides, she's more nails in her recent web series DRAGON AGE: REDEMPTION (which is also not her best work). Stephen McHattie - who effectively plays the sinister preacher on HAVEN - goes overboard with the strident speeches. He also seems to be channeling Lance Henriksen's weathered facial wrinkles and grooves.RED: WEREWOLF HUNTER lifts a page from the Buffyverse in that it features werewolf corpses who disintegrate into flames, maybe because it shares the same budget restrictions. The CG-rendered werewolves don't look polished; they move jarringly. Another concern is the tepid lack of bloodletting and gore and action set pieces. I'm all for establishing a foreboding atmosphere, but this is supposed to be an action horror film. At some point, the fur and silver shivs must fly. But they don't fly enough. Most egregiously, the heroine fails to engage the viewer, and I do somewhat fault Felicia Day for that. I wasn't invested at all in her character or her derring-dos or in her relationship with her fiance (which does become a focal point of the plot). It'll take repeated viewings of ""Do You Wanna Date My Avatar?"" on YouTube to wash off this sense of being let down.",3,Felicia Day versus the Big Bad Wolf and the vagaries of partnering with SyFy,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,3626,"['Even', 'geek', 'goddesses', 'sometimes', 'phone', 'RED', 'WEREWOLF', 'HUNTER', 'yet', 'take', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'terms', 'watchability', 'nowhere', 'realm', 'THE', 'COMPANY', 'OF', 'WOLVES', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'FREEWAY', 'even', 'animated', 'parody', 'HOODWINKED', 'least', '2011', 'RED', 'RIDING', 'HOOD', 'one', 'can', 'commend', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'damning', 'script', 'let', 'down', 'highlight', 'RED', 'WEREWOLF', 'HUNTER', 'was', 'ogling', 'Felicia', 'Day', 'black', 'leathers', 'RED', 'WEREWOLF', 'HUNTER', '2010', 'SyFy', 'television', 'horror', 'feature', 'may', 'fill', 'dread', 'embarrassingly', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'Ennui', 'pretty', 'quickly.Virginia', 'Red', 'Sullivan', 'Day', 'modern-day', 'descendant', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Red', ""n't"", 'fond', 'nickname', 'as', 'much', 'honorific', 'bestowed', 'first-born', 'daughter', 'generation', 'family', 'werewolf', 'hunters', 'truce', 'Sullivan', 'clan', 'remaining', 'werewolf', 'packs', 'Providing', 'werewolves', 'stay', 'deep', 'deep', 'woods', 'Sullivans', 'will', 'desist', 'declaring', 'open', 'season', 'lycanthropes', 'Still', 'Sullivans', 'are', ""n't"", 'have', 'yard', 'sale', 'black', 'leather', 'threads', 'arsenal', 'silver', 'weaponry.But', 'then', 'rogue', 'werewolf', 'named', 'Gabriel', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'along', 'tentative', 'peace', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'Gabriel', 'terrifying', 'new', 'breed', 'can', 'phase', 'will', 'who', ""n't"", 'restrained', 'lack', 'full', 'moon', 'Gabriel', 'seized', 'leadership', 'pack', 'now', 'making', 'move', 'Sullivans', 'Luckily', 'humans', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Virginia', 'Sullivan', 'picked', 'perfect', 'time', 'visit', 'family', 'homestead', 'may', 'regret', 'bringing', 'fiance', 'fellow', 'federal', 'agent', 'Nathan', 'Kessler', 'Kavan', 'Smith', 'family', 'secrets', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'shared.The', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'wet', 'blanket', 'acting', 'infectious', 'movie', 'actors', 'immediately', 'leaden', 'monotone', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Felicia', 'Day', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'detached', 'seemed', 'chemistry', 'ignite', 'scenes', 'Kavan', 'Smith', 'fact', 'more', 'sparks', 'fly', 'combustible', 'werewolves', 'two', 'leads', 'ironic', 'Kavan', 'Smith', 'actually', 'more', 'soulfulness', 'role', 'robotic', 'Deputy', 'Andy', 'EUREKA', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'still', 'getting', 'used', 'notion', 'Felicia', 'Day', 'steely', 'action', 'heroine', 'patented', 'nerdy', 'gamine', 'charm', 'pretty', 'non-existent', 'flick', 'more', 'nails', 'recent', 'web', 'series', 'DRAGON', 'AGE', 'REDEMPTION', 'also', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'who', 'effectively', 'sinister', 'preacher', 'HAVEN', 'overboard', 'strident', 'speeches', 'also', 'be', 'channeling', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'weathered', 'facial', 'wrinkles', 'grooves.RED', 'WEREWOLF', 'HUNTER', 'page', 'Buffyverse', 'werewolf', 'corpses', 'who', 'disintegrate', 'flames', 'maybe', 'shares', 'same', 'budget', 'restrictions', 'CG-rendered', 'werewolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'polished', 'move', 'jarringly', 'concern', 'tepid', 'lack', 'bloodletting', 'gore', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', ""'m"", 'establishing', 'foreboding', 'atmosphere', 'supposed', 'be', 'action', 'horror', 'film', 'point', 'fur', 'silver', 'shivs', 'must', 'fly', 'do', ""n't"", 'fly', 'enough', 'Most', 'egregiously', 'heroine', 'engage', 'viewer', 'do', 'somewhat', 'fault', 'Felicia', 'Day', 'was', ""n't"", 'invested', 'character', 'derring-dos', 'relationship', 'fiance', 'become', 'focal', 'point', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'take', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Do', 'Wan', 'Date', 'My', 'Avatar', 'YouTube', 'wash', 'off', 'sense', 'being', 'let', 'down']",Red: Werewolf Hunter

While there he gets bitten by a werewolf and puts a strain on their relationship as her family hunts werewolves. The film had a decent story line, unfortunately the execution was less than stellar. The dialog reeked and the special effects were 1980ish. The hunting scenes were not very powerful. If werewolves are people during the day, they could use guns for killing also...just a thought. The acting didn't come across as strong.In one scene the werewolves have three people in shackles. The girl in the red sweater has on shackles so large around her wrist, she could easily slip her whole hand through them. What's the point?

1503343,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B005TG8156,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[0, 0]","Well, you can tell this had the budget of an inner city charity.  It is surprising and admirable how well the actors and film makers did.  Unfortunately, there is a lot wrong with this film.Let's cover the cool parts.  The werewolves mid-change look incredible--scary and realistic effects.  The acting is much better than you'd expect.  The hunters are natural, as are the two main werewolf villains.  Hauer and his right hand girl are seriously frightening.Here's the sad thing: everything else in this movie is sort of a downhill ride into a bummer of an evening.  When the werewolves fully transform, they look ridiculous.  Like CGI versions of lanky, starving, reject werewolves from a cartoon.  Seriously laughable and corny.  Then, of course, the action involving these special effects is a joke.So, you get some tension built.  You wonder what the confrontations will be like.  Then you get CGI nonsense.  YET the transformations and mid-change effects are excellent!  How the heck did this happen?  It's as if two different movies were spliced together during a drunken nightmare!  What a way to ruin a movie!Add to that the fact that the werewolves are dirty hobo's--literally--and you end up laughing more than cringing in fear.  How could a pack of super-strong monsters with super-senses not manage to steal some soap, a shower, clean clothes, some camping equipment at least?  There are actually homeless people in real life functioning better than these werewolves.The story is weak, predictable, and passable.  If not for the occasional well-done effects and the actors, this movie would be absolutely UN-watchable.  As it is, the film is just a semi-reasonable way to pass time.  Which stinks, because you get glimpses of a great horror movie every once in a while.  With the same cast, a big budget, a skilled writer, and a skilled special effects team, Red: Werewolf Hunter could easily have been another Underworld.Don't pay to see this.
