Now for this movie..the cast boasts him, Cybill Shepherd, Martin Landau, Neville Brand and the great Raymond Burr. Now with this caliber of talent (I won't include Cybill as talented, she was always awful in everything, consistently) it would have at the very least been interesting. The acting by all was bad, the story was bad, the &#34;effects&#34; were bad and did I mention the acting was bad? The supporting cast was even worse. I know it was 1980 but that doesn't excuse everything...did I mention the acting was bad?

It appealed to me at the time, mostly I suppose because I liked the stars, and it was a fun way to pass a Saturday afternoon.  Especially if you like movies about mysterious space aliens, and I do.  Now I look forward to seeing it again because I have my own tie to it.  No, I have not encountered aliens, but something happened in New Mexico that gave me that connection.  I was on my way home, traveling on a rural highway in the mountains of New Mexico when I drove into a nearly deserted town that seemed strangely familiar.  Among the few structures I saw there were an old gas station and an old dance hall down the street from it that I was sure I had seen before.  And I had, since they figured prominently in the movie which had been filmed there in Willard, NM, some years before.",4,deja vu maybe,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,835,"['Many', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', 'movie', 'HBO', 'appealed', 'time', 'mostly', 'suppose', 'liked', 'stars', 'was', 'fun', 'way', 'pass', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'Especially', 'like', 'movies', 'mysterious', 'space', 'aliens', 'do', 'Now', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'have', 'own', 'tie', 'No', 'have', 'not', 'encountered', 'aliens', 'something', 'happened', 'New', 'Mexico', 'gave', 'connection', 'was', 'way', 'home', 'traveling', 'rural', 'highway', 'mountains', 'New', 'Mexico', 'when', 'drove', 'nearly', 'deserted', 'town', 'seemed', 'strangely', 'familiar', 'few', 'structures', 'saw', 'were', 'old', 'gas', 'station', 'old', 'dance', 'hall', 'street', 'was', 'sure', 'had', 'seen', 'before', 'had', 'figured', 'prominently', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'Willard', 'NM', 'years']",The Return
