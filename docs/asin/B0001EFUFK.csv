There are the bullied kids.  The ""in"" girls (they vomit in unison after eating in the cafeteria).  The shy girl who works in the library. Etc.  Van Sant doesn't seem to care enough to attach any depth to his characters, and he allots them only such prefuntory moments on screen so that we know who they are when they get gunned down. A film like this makes a viewer reconsider the director's entire career.  Was there anything there at all, to begin with?  Or were we just giving him the benefit of the doubt?  What is his exulted reputation based on?  Drugstore Cowboy? This film, and his other recent work, for certain, is vacant, and feels like an exercise rather than a fully-realized piece of art.

802121,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B0001EFUFK,AIROLF,"[0, 0]","A powerful testament to how the world can go upside down at any moment and how unexpected life is, Elephant portrays the events at Columbine High School. Yet, that school is never mentioned and, really, these events could've taken place everywhere at any time. The movie starts off deliberately slow and follows each character as they go about their mundane daily tasks; the camera never leaves each character, switching only between characters. The value of these ordinary moments is given even higher priority when one realizes that the movie is only 1.5 hrs long. The normalcy of the tasks is so boring, in fact, that one almost screams for something more to happen. Shamefully, it does and that's when the movie truly manages to astonish the viewer. The shootings are overwhelming, of course, but it's the raw nature of their portrayal and the unapologetic nature of the characters that shocks the viewer. Unlike other movies, Elephant doesn't want to provide excuses or lay blame; instead, the movie carefully plays out the events in the schools eyes, through characters familiar and newly-introduced characters in the last moments of their lives. The movie's impact is simply undeniable - one can't help but look with apprehension and a further confusion as to the actual proceedings of the tragedy in real life.",4,Gus Van Sant's most compelling work - you can't look and yet you also can't look away,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,1318,"['powerful', 'testament', 'how', 'world', 'can', 'go', 'upside', 'down', 'moment', 'how', 'unexpected', 'life', 'Elephant', 'events', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'school', 'never', 'mentioned', 'really', 'events', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'place', 'everywhere', 'time', 'movie', 'off', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'character', 'go', 'mundane', 'daily', 'tasks', 'camera', 'never', 'character', 'switching', 'only', 'characters', 'value', 'ordinary', 'moments', 'given', 'even', 'higher', 'priority', 'when', 'one', 'movie', 'only', '1.5', 'hrs', 'long', 'normalcy', 'tasks', 'so', 'boring', 'fact', 'one', 'almost', 'screams', 'something', 'more', 'happen', 'Shamefully', 'when', 'movie', 'truly', 'astonish', 'viewer', 'shootings', 'are', 'overwhelming', 'course', 'raw', 'nature', 'portrayal', 'unapologetic', 'nature', 'characters', 'viewer', 'other', 'movies', 'Elephant', ""n't"", 'want', 'provide', 'excuses', 'lay', 'blame', 'instead', 'movie', 'carefully', 'out', 'events', 'schools', 'eyes', 'characters', 'familiar', 'newly-introduced', 'characters', 'last', 'moments', 'lives', 'movie', 'impact', 'simply', 'undeniable', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'look', 'apprehension', 'further', 'confusion', 'actual', 'proceedings', 'tragedy', 'real', 'life']",Elephant

Even though I've seen it straight through I feel as if I missed something and need to see it again. I think after a second viewing I'll be able to fully comprehend the movie.I'm familiar with both sides of the public's reaction to this movie. And I guess both make good cases. &quot;Elephant&quot; is a bit slow moving. Not exactly involving. There is no personal audience involvement. And I didn't relate to anyone in the film. I saw this with my sister and afterwards I said it was an interesting movie that I &quot;think&quot; I enjoyed. She said it was awful because the movie didn't resolve anything. It didn't tell us why the event happened. It didn't take me very long to respond back &quot;what's the difference WHY it happened it simply DID happen.&quot; Do we really need to know why violence happens? I think this is what Gus van Sant was going for. Violence happens and while yes it's a terrible thing we may never be able to get it down to a science and explain why it happens.&quot;Elephant&quot; despite some of its &quot;flaws&quot; has some interesting aspects. I liked the long unbroken camera shots. I liked the mood the film created, even though it seems many didn't. I enjoyed some of the performances and liked the music, which consist of &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;. And above all &quot;Elephant&quot; does seem to be about something. It is exploring an issue. Granted many didn't like the way it explored that issue, but you can't deny it tried.A movie like this is clearly going to divide people and only be enjoyed by a selective few. This is not everyone's &quot;cup of tea&quot;. Those who going into the movie with a clear mind and are willing to go at the movie's pace will enjoy it. But the casual movie fan will find problems.Bottom-line: Interesting film from Gus van Sant I needs to be seen more than once to fully comprehend. It's a difficult movie to watch and may challenge your patience but I think does have its rewarding moments.",4,An &quot;Elephant&quot; Never Forgets.

802125,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001EFUFK,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","This is one of those rare occasions where a film's strengths ultimately become its weaknesses.  There is something so graceful and serene about `Elephant' that you can't help but admire Gus Van Sant's approach to the direction, but in the end that same serene feeling can leave the viewer almost apathetic to the tragic outcome and thus dampens the emotional punch the film should deliver.As the film opens with beautiful cinematography, graceful and simple clean sweeps across the school campus, you can't help but be drawn into this presentation.  It's almost so lucid it's compelling.  There is no depth to the sequences, everything is just so normal.  The characters are ordinary.  They talk about girls and boys and photos and shopping and four-wheeling.  They converse about nothing and accomplish nothing.  They're vapid and apathetic.  In essence they are human.  This is a strength in that the characters appear human.  We feel as though we know them, maybe we are them.  Not every film has to be filled to the brim with characters that have emotional problems for family problems or out of the norm situations.  Yes, one character is obviously shy and introverted and self conscious about her body and one character obviously has some family problems but neither of these issues is exploited for our sympathies.  This same `strength' becomes a major weakness as the film starts to dwindle down to its climax.  These characters are so transparent that their tragic demise doesn't really faze the viewer.  I know that sounds harsh, and let me say that the final moments of the film are heartbreaking, but they don't have a lasting impression.  When the film ended I simply rolled over and went to sleep.  The same graceful approach to the direction also begins to weaken the film in the closing moments.  Instead of tightening the reigns and thrusting the viewer into the violence full throttle they are left to witness everything in a very calm and simple manor.  It leaves the viewer almost detached from the crimes instead of a part of it.But then again, maybe that is the whole point...I think that's why I'm torn with this film.  It lies somewhere between cinematic masterpiece and art-house overshot.  I can't tell if it's trying too hard or not trying hard enough, or maybe the impression of effortlessness is not an impression at all but truly an effortless creation.  The simplicity of the film is either welcomed magnificence or frustrating indifference; it's all a matter of how you look at it.It's quite possible that we are supposed to feel nothing with the credits begin to roll.  It's quite possible that the purpose behind `Elephant' is to prove that tragedies of this magnitude happen so often we as a culture have grown callused to it.  If that is the case then consider this a marvelous example of enlightening cinema.It's also quite possible that that is not the intention at all.In the end `Elephant' is a film that I think everyone needs to see at least once.  It's not a film that anyone can tell you is good or bad because it all comes down to personal connection in the end.  Everyone is going to react differently to this film depending on their own interpretation of the meaning behind it.  In a way this is the films largest strength/weakness.  It suffers in that it reaches a smaller demographic because of its avant-garde production but it soars in that the demographic it does reach; the loyally devoted fans of this film; will embrace it as perfection and thus laud it as a marvelous contribution to the world of cinema.",4,"Beautiful, inspired, organic, pretentious, pointless, apathetic; surprisingly they all apply...",1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,3560,"['one', 'rare', 'occasions', 'where', 'film', 'strengths', 'ultimately', 'become', 'weaknesses', 'something', 'so', 'graceful', 'serene', 'Elephant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'approach', 'direction', 'end', 'same', 'serene', 'feeling', 'can', 'leave', 'viewer', 'almost', 'apathetic', 'tragic', 'outcome', 'thus', 'emotional', 'punch', 'film', 'should', 'deliver.As', 'film', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'graceful', 'simple', 'clean', 'sweeps', 'school', 'campus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'drawn', 'presentation', 'almost', 'so', 'lucid', 'compelling', 'depth', 'sequences', 'everything', 'just', 'so', 'normal', 'characters', 'are', 'ordinary', 'talk', 'girls', 'boys', 'photos', 'shopping', 'four-wheeling', 'converse', 'nothing', 'accomplish', 'nothing', ""'re"", 'vapid', 'apathetic', 'essence', 'are', 'human', 'strength', 'characters', 'appear', 'human', 'feel', 'know', 'maybe', 'are', 'Not', 'film', 'be', 'filled', 'brim', 'characters', 'have', 'emotional', 'problems', 'family', 'problems', 'norm', 'situations', 'Yes', 'one', 'character', 'obviously', 'shy', 'introverted', 'conscious', 'body', 'one', 'character', 'obviously', 'family', 'problems', 'issues', 'exploited', 'sympathies', 'same', 'strength', 'major', 'weakness', 'film', 'dwindle', 'down', 'climax', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'transparent', 'tragic', 'demise', ""n't"", 'really', 'faze', 'viewer', 'know', 'harsh', 'let', 'say', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'heartbreaking', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lasting', 'impression', 'When', 'film', 'ended', 'simply', 'rolled', 'over', 'went', 'sleep', 'same', 'graceful', 'approach', 'direction', 'also', 'weaken', 'film', 'closing', 'moments', 'Instead', 'tightening', 'reigns', 'thrusting', 'viewer', 'violence', 'full', 'throttle', 'are', 'left', 'witness', 'everything', 'very', 'calm', 'simple', 'manor', 'viewer', 'almost', 'detached', 'crimes', 'instead', 'part', 'it.But', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'whole', 'point', 'think', 'why', ""'m"", 'torn', 'film', 'somewhere', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'art-house', 'overshot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'not', 'trying', 'hard', 'enough', 'maybe', 'impression', 'effortlessness', 'not', 'impression', 'truly', 'effortless', 'creation', 'simplicity', 'film', 'either', 'welcomed', 'magnificence', 'frustrating', 'indifference', 'matter', 'how', 'look', 'it.It', 'quite', 'possible', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'nothing', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', 'quite', 'possible', 'purpose', 'Elephant', 'prove', 'tragedies', 'magnitude', 'happen', 'so', 'often', 'culture', 'have', 'grown', 'callused', 'case', 'then', 'consider', 'marvelous', 'example', 'enlightening', 'cinema.It', 'also', 'quite', 'possible', 'not', 'intention', 'end', 'Elephant', 'film', 'think', 'everyone', 'needs', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'not', 'film', 'anyone', 'can', 'tell', 'good', 'bad', 'down', 'personal', 'connection', 'end', 'Everyone', 'going', 'react', 'differently', 'film', 'depending', 'own', 'interpretation', 'meaning', 'way', 'films', 'largest', 'strength/weakness', 'smaller', 'demographic', 'avant-garde', 'production', 'demographic', 'reach', 'loyally', 'devoted', 'fans', 'film', 'will', 'embrace', 'perfection', 'thus', 'laud', 'marvelous', 'contribution', 'world', 'cinema']",Elephant
802126,A3TXO9NUIJ4G0X,B0001EFUFK,Angela,"[1, 1]","Gus Van Sant's Elephant covers the timely and terrible topic of school shootings. Inherently provocative, it's nonetheless the best film we could imagine about such a thing. Van Sant chooses to present the story using pure ultrarealism, with absolutely no embellishment or explanation. No one is afforded any cinematic villainy, heroism or redemption - though there are, one could argue, moments of all three. In the end, however, you are left with the same questions you might have had in the beginning.Yet it's also a beautiful film - filmed in gloriously wide aperture (we think?) with gloriously sensitive film, Gus Van Sant's technical skills give brilliance to mundane real life. Before the two shooters enter the doors, we follow them - and a number of other students - as they pass through the labyrinthine halls, their homes, their parents' cars and live their daily lives. It would be easy to label them according to a Breakfast Club menu of teen types: the sensitive photographer Elias (Elias McConnell), the trio of bulimic cool girls (Brittany Mountain, Jordan Taylor and Nicole George), the football player (Nathan Tyson) and his girlfriend (Carrie Finklea), and the charismatic, peroxide-blond John (John Robinson). But these are just the labels we choose to apply; there's barely any dialogue, characterization is at best opaquely hinted at, and most scenes feature only the muted murmurs of passing students, the clatter of closing lockers and the squeak of sneakers on linoleum floors. We spend much of the film following these characters back and forth during their typical day, and we frequently replay the same moments from several viewpoints. In the end, we have an overarching portrait of an average, large, American high school. Everything is then swiftly destroyed in the final twenty minutes, but even that destruction is muted, removed, difficult to follow and therefore terrifying. It could be anywhere, because it looks like everywhere.One or two moments satisfy stereotypical movie criteria - there's a relatively thin narrative arc surrounding John and his drunken dad - but mostly the film is meditative and exposition-free. The two shooters, Alex (Alex Frost) and Eric (Eric Deulen), are enigmatic. While there is a token scene of bullying for Alex, as well as some ambiguities regarding their relationship, the psychological complexities are never explicitly explored. We never quite understand why they choose to do what they do. We can only watch them as they prepare.And perhaps that's the film's only condemnatory note: when Alex and Eric lazily browse the Internet and order a gun, we couldn't help but feel activist alarm about American gun control. This will not do! But we can let that debate rest for another day, the film itself provides no argument. Indeed, apparently Gus Van Sant intended the title to refer to the parable of several blind men describing an elephant by feeling its individual parts: in the end, they variously describe the elephant as being like a drain pipe, a fan, a pillar or a throne, based on which part of the elephant they touched. Similarly, the film presents one event through various prisms. Yet even composing all this observational evidence together, we still don't understand the elephant at all.*Review originally published at the Post-Punk Cinema Club.",5,"A drain pipe, a fan, a pillar and a throne.",1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,3331,"['Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Elephant', 'timely', 'terrible', 'topic', 'school', 'shootings', 'Inherently', 'provocative', 'nonetheless', 'best', 'film', 'could', 'imagine', 'thing', 'Van', 'Sant', 'present', 'story', 'using', 'pure', 'ultrarealism', 'absolutely', 'embellishment', 'explanation', 'one', 'afforded', 'cinematic', 'villainy', 'heroism', 'redemption', 'are', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'moments', 'three', 'end', 'however', 'are', 'left', 'same', 'questions', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'beginning.Yet', 'also', 'beautiful', 'film', 'filmed', 'gloriously', 'wide', 'aperture', 'think', 'gloriously', 'sensitive', 'film', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'technical', 'skills', 'give', 'brilliance', 'mundane', 'real', 'life', 'two', 'shooters', 'enter', 'doors', 'follow', 'number', 'other', 'students', 'pass', 'labyrinthine', 'halls', 'homes', 'parents', 'cars', 'live', 'daily', 'lives', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'label', 'according', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'menu', 'teen', 'types', 'sensitive', 'photographer', 'Elias', 'Elias', 'McConnell', 'trio', 'bulimic', 'cool', 'girls', 'Brittany', 'Mountain', 'Jordan', 'Taylor', 'Nicole', 'George', 'football', 'player', 'Nathan', 'Tyson', 'girlfriend', 'Carrie', 'Finklea', 'charismatic', 'peroxide-blond', 'John', 'John', 'Robinson', 'are', 'just', 'labels', 'choose', 'apply', 'barely', 'dialogue', 'characterization', 'best', 'opaquely', 'hinted', 'most', 'scenes', 'feature', 'only', 'muted', 'murmurs', 'passing', 'students', 'clatter', 'closing', 'lockers', 'squeak', 'sneakers', 'linoleum', 'floors', 'spend', 'much', 'film', 'following', 'characters', 'back', 'forth', 'typical', 'day', 'frequently', 'replay', 'same', 'moments', 'several', 'viewpoints', 'end', 'have', 'overarching', 'portrait', 'average', 'large', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'Everything', 'then', 'swiftly', 'destroyed', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'even', 'destruction', 'muted', 'removed', 'difficult', 'follow', 'therefore', 'terrifying', 'could', 'be', 'anywhere', 'everywhere.One', 'two', 'moments', 'satisfy', 'stereotypical', 'movie', 'criteria', 'relatively', 'thin', 'narrative', 'arc', 'surrounding', 'John', 'drunken', 'dad', 'mostly', 'film', 'meditative', 'exposition-free', 'two', 'shooters', 'Alex', 'Alex', 'Frost', 'Eric', 'Eric', 'Deulen', 'are', 'enigmatic', 'token', 'scene', 'bullying', 'Alex', 'as', 'well', 'ambiguities', 'regarding', 'relationship', 'psychological', 'complexities', 'are', 'never', 'explicitly', 'explored', 'never', 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'choose', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'prepare.And', 'perhaps', 'film', 'only', 'condemnatory', 'note', 'when', 'Alex', 'Eric', 'lazily', 'Internet', 'order', 'gun', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'activist', 'alarm', 'American', 'gun', 'control', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'can', 'let', 'debate', 'rest', 'day', 'film', 'argument', 'Indeed', 'apparently', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'intended', 'title', 'refer', 'parable', 'several', 'men', 'describing', 'elephant', 'feeling', 'individual', 'parts', 'end', 'variously', 'describe', 'elephant', 'being', 'drain', 'pipe', 'fan', 'pillar', 'throne', 'based', 'part', 'elephant', 'touched', 'Similarly', 'film', 'one', 'event', 'various', 'prisms', 'even', 'composing', 'observational', 'evidence', 'together', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'elephant', '*Review', 'originally', 'published', 'Post-Punk', 'Cinema', 'Club']",Elephant

An awful lot of time passes during their stalk and the police never arrive. Is this at all possible in an age of cellphones?What are the motivations of the dark-haired killer? We know he practices Beethoven sonatas and watches Hitler documentaries and that he and his friend briefly experiment with each other in the shower, but what has made him such a sociopath? Obviously, in a 90 minute film you can't go into too much depth on every character's life, but shouldn't more focus have been placed on events that led to bomb and weapons stockpiling and assault plans carried out with deadly results?Then, the story has no resolution. (SPOILERS AHEAD)The two boys reunite in the cafeteria after their individual killing sprees. One shoots the other at point-blank range, then searches the kitchen's walk-in freezer, corners a young couple and plays eeny-meenie-miney-moe with them as the camera pulls back. Cut to a cloudy sky, roll credits.That's an ending?Finally and most importantly, for the vast majority of viewers this film will be accepted as what it is, a depiction of tragedy. Whether such gruesomely unpredictable violence is avoidable can be debated. Of real concern is that a troubled kid may watch this and use it as a primer to launch his own school attack.

Elephant is an interesting movie that shows an apparent normal day in a public school. The camera moves slowly from one character to another, making connections in the corridor and classrooms of the school. We are just witnesses of what is going to happen from different perspectives. Strories are connected in some way and have their own meaning and criticism.Photography and music are outstanding points in the film. The football game scene has been shoted with a standing camera so we can see only a part of what is happening. In this point is when you realize about the concept of the movie: we can see traces of the reality, fragemented pieces, because life is so big to be captured in a movie. Maybe you haven't heard the elephant story so I'm going to tell you, it's something like this: There were a bunch of people with their eyes badaged. They were asked to touch and feel the object they have in front, and then tell what they think the object was. Each person ended making a different veredict Why? Beacuse they only have a tiny piece of information, not the whole.What was an apparent normal day became tragedy. Since the start of the movie we feel that something is going wrong: The initial sequence with the drunken dad; the guy who is a really talented piano player and who like to get involved with cruel videogames; the girls that vomit their food in order to be skinny; and so on. Ending sequence show us the result of all this violence incubated. The final scene, with the still camera shoting the grey sky, is emotional and moving.Some people think it's a slow movie, I disagree, it has its own rythm and his own meaning, like our lives.

802129,ARA48345JZPZR,B0001EFUFK,Archmaker,"[5, 11]","There was some tension involved in watching Elephant because, knowing it is about a Columbine type of school shooting, I did not want to see any of these young people murdered in the inevitable finale. That said however, I found the movie too detached in its presentation and too coldly dispassionate about the events depicted to create any resonance.I can understand Van Sant's difficulty in trying to explain the inexplicable but his subsequent avoidance of any attempt to provide any background and context for these actions, his failure to shed any light on the matter means we have here simply an exercise depicting the surface of things only. Nothing is learned. What then is the purpose of this film?Beyond the lack of substance I did not care for the execution of the film either. The long tracking shots of students walking through the corridors and across the lawns of the High School, meant no doubt to convey the depersonalized atmosphere of what is a large facility and the consequent isolation and/or alienation of the students quickly became tedious and tiresome.Likewise, the lack of any dialogue of any consequence may be meant to create verisimilitude of reality and to depict either the inanity and insipidness of High School or, worse yet, the students themselves. But film is NOT reality.  Of course everyday life doesn't always have interesting or crackling dialogue but that is why we have the Art of Writing (to enhance and enrich our understanding, to convey meaning).Finally, while Van Sant does present the ordinariness of the killers and their cool murderous calculations, what on earth was the bit in the shower supposed to mean? A reflection of the class discussion shown about repressed homosexuality? I don't think so. I found that scene jarringly amiss.It might be of passing interest to some that an exhaustive study of the two Columbine killers has finally been completed. Despite the myth that has grown and become accepted that they were the victims of bullying, the study found otherwise. Bullying was no more or less a problem at Columbine than at the H.S. I went to years ago. The problem was simply that Eric Harris was a psychopath, who found a perfect partner to help him carry out his murderous fantasies. If he hadn't done this, he would have done something else just as deadly, perhaps serial killings. Whether intentional or not, Van Sant's piano-playing murderer catches some of that, and for that little bit of insight in an otherwise fairly dull and empty film, I will give him 2 stars.",2,No Heat.

Lack of psychological insightI rented this movie based on Gus Van Sant's reputation and the synopsis attracts me.  I do not rate this movie one star because it couldn't live up to its promise, but because everything is done wrong.The direction is what you'd call an art house movie.  But an ""art"" ought to get someone to think, and this one doesn't.  The movie is a juxtaposition of various pretty pictures without some coherent meaning.Maybe I just don't get it.  Example, when John slapped his butt for a photo shoot, it was ingenious the first time, but after the third time, it gets old.  In poetry, if a message is repeated, it must mean something or to reinforce some idea.  But I'm sorry, I don't get how John slapped his own butt is a symbol of anything.  Bottom line: cut the crap out in the editing room.Whoever did the music design ought to be guillotined.  Why Moonlight Sonata?  How does it enhance the mood of the movie?  But none of that really matter as long as it does not overrides the background ambiance, which brilliantly brings out the atmosphere of the school, whereas the music score falls short on it.  Discordance, yes, but why do it when John entered the school.  Was he the villain who disrupts the school?  Incorrect usage of motif.  F for music design.Given Gus Van Sant's reputation is built on gay coming of age story, I don't blame him for choosing some nice looking boys in his movies (though I think it's a little exploitative a la Andy Warhol).  But what is their purpose in the movie if their characters are not developed?  Was John a hero?  Were Eric and Alex villains or anti-heroes?  No clear sense of direction....  What's Eric's and Alex's motive to go on a rampage?  Were they bullied?  I didn't see that in the movie, but I get the cue maybe John was and was misunderstood by the principal.  Why didn't he go on a rampage?  Erm..., maybe because people don't snap like that easily?  Why Columbine and other school massacres happened?  Did production team discuss any of the possibilities why Alex and Eric would want to kill people like that?  Did they ask the young actors who played the roles?  This is not a pretty picture with no substance, is it?  (sorry, that's a rhetorical question)The characterization is as vague as the question, are Alex and Eric gay?  You get to see them kiss, but you don't know if they are gay or not.  Maybe it's just a goodbye kiss, or maybe they're just emos without the makeup.  If they were lovers, how could Alex kill Eric like that?  If they were bullied in school and depend on each other to cope with the situation, how COULD they do that?  Characterization:  F minus.A movie like this should offer possible explanation that'll get people to think about the issue, and this one merely feeds the public with preexisting stereotype.

It was obvious that the intent was to simply present the story in a chronologically backwards style and allow you to draw your own conclusions- and there's nothing wrong with that. However, the reason good films don't depict real life in real-life time is because it's simply boring to do so.

802137,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0001EFUFK,Benjamin,"[87, 113]","In ELEPHANT, director Gus Van Sant provides us with a day in the life of a high school, seen literally from the perspective of several students. Life in high school is presented realistically as boring. Some people have good times; others don't. Even the awkward girl isn't given many scenes to generate sympathy for her character. As a viewer, you don't really get to know much about any of the characters. You see that some of them are talented. Some of them are troubled. Some of them are just going through the motions.Going into the film, you should be aware that a shooting will happen on this day. But, while watching it, you don't know when it's going to happen, who's going to do it, who's going to live or who's going to die. But the sense of dread you get builds as the film goes along.Once the film identifies the shooters, we get a brief glimpse of their home life. We see how they got the guns. We get only an idea of the sort of video games they play, the films they watch, the drawings they've created. (The only real elephant seen in the film is a drawing that one of the killers has done and placed on his wall. He doesn't talk about it. We just see it.) We see one of them is a really good piano player. We see that he gets occasionally picked on by bullies, but we don't get the sense that he's overcome with a need for vengeance. We see the killers speak of the last day of their lives, and they kiss. We don't know if it's the first time they have done this. We don't know if they're gay or straight. I got the sense that this is the only time that they'll get a chance to kiss anyone, so they kiss each other. (Van Sant himself is gay, which I think is key. He's not suggesting that gay people are killers. But he's not saying that the killers in his film weren't repressed homosexuals, either. In the scene, he's saying that homosexuality alone cannot be seen as a reason for the violence.) No real motive is provided by the film itself, but you get hints of what actions other people will blame after the fact.The film, in this extended scene outside of the school moreso than any other, shows the point that the filmmaker intends - that there is no way to determine the causes of this sort of violence and that there are no messages or clearly defined ""heroes"" and ""villains"" within such violence. Van Sant supplies the audience with a glimpse of several things that will be examined and dissected by others in the community within the film in the aftermath of the violence.But, in taking us inside the school during the shooting, he shows us that it is random, brutal, unmotivated and cold violence. It has no reasons or explanations, because nothing this tragic can be blamed on any one thing. The killers even deserve some consideration because they're children, just like the other victims.The film is excellent and thought-provoking, though it's bleak and sad.",5,Harrowing and fascinating.,1070409600,"12 3, 2003",2003,2891,"['ELEPHANT', 'director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'day', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'seen', 'literally', 'perspective', 'several', 'students', 'Life', 'high', 'school', 'presented', 'realistically', 'boring', 'people', 'have', 'good', 'times', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'Even', 'awkward', 'girl', ""n't"", 'given', 'many', 'scenes', 'generate', 'sympathy', 'character', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'know', 'much', 'characters', 'see', 'are', 'talented', 'are', 'troubled', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'motions.Going', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'shooting', 'will', 'happen', 'day', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'going', 'happen', 'who', 'going', 'do', 'who', 'going', 'live', 'who', 'going', 'die', 'sense', 'dread', 'get', 'builds', 'film', 'film', 'shooters', 'get', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'home', 'life', 'see', 'how', 'got', 'guns', 'get', 'only', 'idea', 'sort', 'video', 'games', 'play', 'films', 'watch', 'drawings', ""'ve"", 'created', 'only', 'real', 'elephant', 'seen', 'film', 'drawing', 'one', 'killers', 'done', 'placed', 'wall', ""n't"", 'talk', 'just', 'see', 'see', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'piano', 'player', 'see', 'occasionally', 'picked', 'bullies', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'overcome', 'need', 'vengeance', 'see', 'killers', 'speak', 'last', 'day', 'lives', 'kiss', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'re"", 'gay', 'straight', 'got', 'sense', 'only', 'time', ""'ll"", 'get', 'chance', 'kiss', 'anyone', 'kiss', 'other', 'Van', 'Sant', 'gay', 'think', 'key', 'not', 'suggesting', 'gay', 'people', 'are', 'killers', 'not', 'saying', 'killers', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'repressed', 'homosexuals', 'either', 'scene', 'saying', 'homosexuality', 'alone', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'reason', 'violence', 'real', 'motive', 'provided', 'film', 'get', 'hints', 'what', 'actions', 'other', 'people', 'will', 'blame', 'fact.The', 'film', 'extended', 'scene', 'school', 'moreso', 'other', 'point', 'filmmaker', 'way', 'determine', 'causes', 'sort', 'violence', 'are', 'messages', 'clearly', 'defined', 'heroes', 'villains', 'such', 'violence', 'Van', 'Sant', 'audience', 'glimpse', 'several', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'examined', 'dissected', 'others', 'community', 'film', 'aftermath', 'violence.But', 'taking', 'school', 'shooting', 'random', 'brutal', 'unmotivated', 'cold', 'violence', 'reasons', 'explanations', 'nothing', 'tragic', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'one', 'thing', 'killers', 'even', 'deserve', 'consideration', ""'re"", 'children', 'just', 'other', 'victims.The', 'film', 'excellent', 'thought-provoking', 'bleak', 'sad']",Elephant

The acting is believable, cute, and entertaining. The cinematography apt, and the direction well-thought out.My complaints are that it moves a little slowly, this perhaps due to my fascination with action films and fight scenes, but I suppose that is part of the point. It's a slow, dramatic build to shocking horror of the most realistic variety.The film jumps around a bit, showing us different characters from their perspectives and it's kind of interesting how they cross paths and interact, and how their fates are seemingly plucked from a hat at random.All the kids in the film seemed fresh, young and energetic. They are all unknowns which I think makes them more anonymous, more the feeling that they could be anyone or anyone's children. It also shocks us that those same innocents can be capable of such raw violence and hatred.To me, it goes to show that this 'socialization' we peddle as 'education' isn't work a damn.

802141,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,B0001EFUFK,Bob L,"[4, 7]","Boy, talk about mixed reviews. I liked Elephant very much. I don't why but it reminded me a bit of Ghost World. The complaint voiced by most of the negative reviews was the complaint I would have made for The Virgin Suicides. The difference is that, in a sense, Elephant is about an actual incident. So, where my teenage nieces were able to connect to T.V.S. and I did not, I was able to connect with Elephant even though I've been out of High School for better than thirty years.For the people who were annoyed by the style Van Sant used, I have no answer for you. I was totally engrossed by the style and this 80 minute movie seemed to go by in a flash.Amazingly good acting by all these kids. It reminded me of the two kids in High Fidelity who made the recording that Cusack wanted to produce. Terrific confidence shines through.What this movie helps you think about is the matter of guilt and innocence in the aftermath and what a sticky issue it can be. Finger pointing really isn't an issue here and I think that p**sed-off a lot of people.One observation that seems curious to me was the take most people had on the sexually of Eric and Alex. I think the scene was to demostrate how little these two had experienced in their lives and how short they had been alive. With so little to draw upon in your life it doesn't take a lot to drive you in a particular direction and that direction can be incredible extreme.In the end I can't tell you whether or not you'll enjoy this film.

He's also careful to avoid trying to direct our emotions in any overt way. He approaches the material with the coldness of a documentary film maker, which is the right approach for this kind of material. Over sentimentilizing the material or focusing too much on the sensational aspects would have dumbed down material that needs to be handled intelligently and objectively if it is to have any impact.  And boy, does this film have impact.The cinematography is beautiful, full of tracking shots that would make Stanley Kubrick proud. The incredible amount of time spent traversing the school building and grounds has the effect of making the school itself a character.

802149,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0001EFUFK,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 6]","Elephant is an exceptional film despite the cool conceptual quality of the whole enterprise. Even though some dialogue was improvised, the film definitely feels in control.We experience the boredom and routine nature of everyday life in a Colorado high school which is pulled into total chaos in the final 20 minutes of the film when two students begin killing fellow students and teachers.The routine in this film builds suspense. We see and learn enough about the two killers to build tension. Yet, the climax is strangely silent as students run around the halls trying to duck for cover or escape the building. I did feel that Van Sant was able to capture the ""outsider"" aspects of the two young killers. One is taunted by a larger more handsome athletic student, a scene that everyone who has attended high school knows. When the two young men take a shower together and kiss I was left with the uncertainty as to whether they were gay, or teenage boys sexually experimenting, or sealing a bond, or experiencing intimacy with another person on the fringe of a larger society.The young killers are outsiders, on the margin of the group, and alienated. Yes, the scenes and kids were ordinary. Yes, the teasing and ostracizing is typical of all high schools. There are kids on the fringe of every community. Van Sant just reminds us of the costs.I would recommend this film be shown in public high schools followed by discussion. I realize this concept would freak out 95% of the parents in the USA, but ostracism and alienation represses the outsiders and it also represses the insiders and bright teenagers can learn this lesson.",5,When kids kill kids are we really surprised?,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,1632,"['Elephant', 'exceptional', 'film', 'cool', 'conceptual', 'quality', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'Even', 'dialogue', 'was', 'improvised', 'film', 'definitely', 'control.We', 'experience', 'boredom', 'routine', 'nature', 'everyday', 'life', 'Colorado', 'high', 'school', 'pulled', 'total', 'chaos', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'two', 'students', 'begin', 'killing', 'fellow', 'students', 'teachers.The', 'routine', 'film', 'suspense', 'see', 'learn', 'enough', 'two', 'killers', 'build', 'tension', 'climax', 'strangely', 'silent', 'students', 'run', 'halls', 'trying', 'duck', 'cover', 'escape', 'building', 'did', 'feel', 'Van', 'Sant', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'outsider', 'aspects', 'two', 'young', 'killers', 'One', 'taunted', 'larger', 'more', 'handsome', 'athletic', 'student', 'scene', 'everyone', 'who', 'attended', 'high', 'school', 'knows', 'When', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'take', 'shower', 'together', 'kiss', 'was', 'left', 'uncertainty', 'were', 'gay', 'teenage', 'boys', 'sexually', 'experimenting', 'sealing', 'bond', 'experiencing', 'intimacy', 'person', 'fringe', 'larger', 'society.The', 'young', 'killers', 'are', 'outsiders', 'margin', 'group', 'alienated', 'Yes', 'scenes', 'kids', 'were', 'ordinary', 'Yes', 'teasing', 'ostracizing', 'typical', 'high', 'schools', 'are', 'kids', 'fringe', 'community', 'Van', 'Sant', 'just', 'costs.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'be', 'shown', 'public', 'high', 'schools', 'followed', 'discussion', 'realize', 'concept', 'would', 'freak', 'out', '95', '%', 'parents', 'USA', 'ostracism', 'alienation', 'outsiders', 'also', 'insiders', 'bright', 'teenagers', 'can', 'learn', 'lesson']",Elephant
802150,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,B0001EFUFK,Cecily Champagne,"[0, 5]","Not all movies are meant to entertain, and certainly, Gus Van Sant's `Elephant' is not entertaining in a traditional sense.  This is the kind of movie that viewers must ""experience"" and then contemplate.  I like that.  I recently saw Krysztof Kieslowski's `Blue' (a much less difficult film, though also quite languid in its pace) and was completely absorbed.  But - you know - just because a film breaks free from the conventions of your typically mindless, hackneyed blockbuster - that doesn't necessarily make it a good film.  And I don't think `Elephant' is a very good film.Let me preface my complaints with a few thoughts about this film's positive qualities, though.  As intimated, it is millions of miles away from your typical Hollywood hit - and I find that really refreshing.  I liked the lingering shots, the sparse dialogue, and the attempts at ""realism.""  I was also intrigued by Van Sant's refusal to ""comment"" on school violence.  What can we say about Columbine, school shootings, and - really - any violent acts?  There is no explanation.And yet - I don't think `Elephant' was a successful film.  Here's why:*  To begin with, any attempts at ""realism"" were negated by the actors' and actresses' very awkward handling of dialogue and poor improvisational skills.  The effect was that of a student film.  Very forced.  I was constantly aware that I was watching a production and did not feel like I was spying on a slice of life.* Also, while high schools are probably more like the high school in `Elephant' than the high schools in - oh say - `Clueless' or `Mean Girls' - it lacked any of the warmth of a real high school.  The building and the students felt very sterile to me.  I also felt like the featured students were facing exceptionally grave realities (an alcoholic parent; possible pregnancy; an eating disorder).  Yes, these problems exist.  But where's the high school student who is just worried about her math test?  Or the student who is joking with his friend in the lunch line?* I had said that I enjoy lingering shots.  For the most part I do - but I also need to say that I think Van Sant borders on indulgent with his exceedingly tedious, almost antagonizing  ""cinematography.""  I don't know if this is a full-fledged criticism of mine - but I can see how many viewers, even viewers who are usually into more ""artsy"" films - might feel put off by his technique.* Lastly - as mentioned - Van Sant does not comment on school violence.  While this is an admirable quality - it is, paradoxically, also one of the film's downfalls.  Why did he make the film?  To tell us that he has nothing to say?  I could perhaps handle his silence on a serious topic if `Elephant' had other, redeeming qualities but - in the end - I really don't think it does.  It was an interesting and perhaps ambitious experiment, but one that I could have done without.",2,Good in theory - but it doesn't work for me,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,2877,"['Not', 'movies', 'are', 'meant', 'entertain', 'certainly', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Elephant', 'not', 'entertaining', 'traditional', 'sense', 'kind', 'movie', 'viewers', 'must', 'experience', 'then', 'contemplate', 'recently', 'saw', 'Krysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'Blue', 'much', 'less', 'difficult', 'film', 'though', 'also', 'quite', 'languid', 'pace', 'was', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'know', 'just', 'film', 'breaks', 'free', 'conventions', 'typically', 'mindless', 'hackneyed', 'blockbuster', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Elephant', 'very', 'good', 'film.Let', 'preface', 'complaints', 'few', 'thoughts', 'film', 'positive', 'qualities', 'though', 'intimated', 'millions', 'miles', 'away', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'hit', 'find', 'really', 'refreshing', 'liked', 'lingering', 'shots', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'attempts', 'realism', 'was', 'also', 'intrigued', 'Van', 'Sant', 'refusal', 'comment', 'school', 'violence', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Columbine', 'school', 'shootings', 'really', 'violent', 'acts', 'explanation.And', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Elephant', 'was', 'successful', 'film', 'Here', 'why', '*', 'begin', 'attempts', 'realism', 'were', 'negated', 'actors', 'actresses', 'very', 'awkward', 'handling', 'dialogue', 'poor', 'improvisational', 'skills', 'effect', 'was', 'student', 'film', 'Very', 'forced', 'was', 'constantly', 'aware', 'was', 'watching', 'production', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'spying', 'slice', 'life', '*', 'Also', 'high', 'schools', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'high', 'school', 'Elephant', 'high', 'schools', 'oh', 'say', 'Clueless', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'lacked', 'warmth', 'real', 'high', 'school', 'building', 'students', 'felt', 'very', 'sterile', 'also', 'felt', 'featured', 'students', 'were', 'facing', 'exceptionally', 'grave', 'realities', 'alcoholic', 'parent', 'possible', 'pregnancy', 'eating', 'disorder', 'Yes', 'problems', 'exist', 'where', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'just', 'worried', 'math', 'test', 'student', 'who', 'joking', 'friend', 'lunch', 'line', '*', 'had', 'said', 'enjoy', 'lingering', 'shots', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'also', 'need', 'say', 'think', 'Van', 'Sant', 'borders', 'indulgent', 'exceedingly', 'tedious', 'almost', 'antagonizing', 'cinematography', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'full-fledged', 'criticism', 'mine', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'viewers', 'even', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'usually', 'more', 'artsy', 'films', 'might', 'feel', 'put', 'off', 'technique', 'Lastly', 'mentioned', 'Van', 'Sant', 'not', 'comment', 'school', 'violence', 'admirable', 'quality', 'paradoxically', 'also', 'one', 'film', 'downfalls', 'Why', 'did', 'make', 'film', 'tell', 'nothing', 'say', 'could', 'perhaps', 'handle', 'silence', 'serious', 'topic', 'Elephant', 'had', 'other', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'end', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'ambitious', 'experiment', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'done']",Elephant

I have seen his other film 'Gerry' (which I surprisingly liked) and this one is very similar to that as there are heavy amounts of small talk and long slow steadycam shots. I really like Van Sant; his vision is Amazing and his concepts which at first might seem crazy, but, in the end they really do work. The detail that went on to putting this film together is Outstanding. Anyone who is interested in the fimmaking process (such as I) should go out and watch this movie right away. The precision timing of each individual story as it blends into the other stories are Excellent! (you'll see what I mean) and they are all done in one long continous shot! I also need to talk about the actors, all of them are great in this film. Van Sant held an open audition to actors and non-actors and he casted them perfectly, as they are all high school students with some training in the field of acting and ALL of them were great in it, because who better to play high school students than high school students themselves.This is a truly honest film. I'm a high school student myself (A Senior) and this film is pretty tame in presenting what teens go through in high school, but it's still just as strong in trying to convey the message. Not only does this film focous on school violence but it also shows issues ranging from family problems, to anorexia up to homosexuality. Even though Van Sant doesn't really dive into the issues and explain why these teens are like this, well it's because most teenagers don't really want to talk about it. Which is why he's sheding a light on these issue to make not only teenagers aware but also parents as well.Elephant is an HBOfilm that was shown in limited theatres, but now it's on DVD.

The attack was perpetrated by two kids who were social outcasts in their school, and felt that the only way they could get even and send a message was to march into school armed with guns and bombs and kill everyone and anyone who got in their way. Now here we have Elephant, a film that depicts an eerily similar, but fictitious, day at a high school that might be any high school in our country.This film's brilliance is in its simplicity. The camera follows around normal kids as they do what normal kids do on any normal school day: they go to class, eat lunch in the cafeteria, and talk about boys and girls and birds and bees. Only, when a pair of boys show up toting black bags and dressed in camouflage, we know this is no ordinary day.Elephant does not tell a story; it simply observes. The long tracking shots follow different kids around as they walk through the halls and say ""hey"" to their friends, or eat lunch and talk about what they'll do after school, or how much they hate their parents because they won't let them do anything.And all the while, the suspense builds, because we know what's coming, and these are nice kids, some of them a little shallow maybe, but kids with good intentions, with bright futures that are about to be crushed because inevitably some kids are less popular than others, and can't handle it.So what about the killers themselves? They're uncool. They sit in class and get junk thrown at them by the cool kids - the jocks - and don't say anything. Their anger builds inside while their faces show indifference.

The camera wanders the campus and hallways, and follows oddly polite, possibly medicated students from room to room for more than an hour until, finally, terrible violence erupts.Writer-director Gus Van Sant plays a lot of bizarre, unsettling tricks with sound and focus, and the movie is eerie and beautiful, an afterschool special crossed with ""The Shining.""Still, does he have a point? He drops lots of possible explanations for the crimes (violent video games, easy access to guns and extra-strength teen angst) and underlines the futility of it all (many of the characters who die are even bigger outcasts than the shooters). But Van Sant doesn't really draw any real conclusions about the movie's Columbine-like situation, he just lets it play out, which will frustrate many viewers but enthrall others.

802158,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0001EFUFK,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","It's no surprise that the reviews on Amazon.com are bimodal - many reviewers think this is a great film, others hate it.  The professionals summarised on Rotten Tomatoes are similarly divided.  You'll notice that I said ""think it's a great film"", not ""loved the film"".  There is a difference.  It's hard to ""love"" a film that moves this slowly and has such a grim subject matter.  For about an hour, Gus van Sant simply follows students through empty hallways and filled cafeterias.  The chronology is somewhat confusing, as he give no clues when switching between people about the progression of the day - is the football practice in the morning?  Lunch?  What about the photographer - when is he developing the film?  To say that the film is maddening at the beginning is an understatement.  The viewer will have to be patient and watch, just as van Sant's camera watches, to see what the filmaker had in mind.Then comes the shootings.  They are brutal and pathetic.  Again, it must be a deliberate choice by van Sant that the first victim is an even bigger ""loser"" (on the high school social scale) than the shooters.  This is what makes the shooters pathetic - they are not out for revenge, they have no statement to make, i.e. they are so pathetic they can't even formulate a reason why they are killing people.  Are real high school shooters like this?  Is there any way to rationalise such actions (for us or for the shooters themselves)?  Van Sant seems to suggest that there is not.The film is skillfully made - the takes are long (several minutes without cuts).  The actors are believeable (even if the school is not - where are all the students of this school?  It looks like it's only 1/4 filled to capacity).  The method of presentation is thought-provoking.  The film will not sit well with people that are looking for answers (or even questions).  Sometimes there simply are no answers, and van Sant does not cheapen his film by trying to provide them.

Van Sant skillfully interweves each of the characters with different perspectives on each interaction and time-shifting to build the tension.  When the inevitable violence comes at the end of the movie, it's quietly intense, making it feel more honest and real than your standard stupid Hollywood shoot-'em-up.

802162,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B0001EFUFK,Daniel McInnis,"[0, 1]","Of all the adjectives you're likely to hear in discussions of the 2003 Palme d'Or winner, the one most likely to pop up is... Boring?  The surprise of this is, though, that this label is not entirely undeserved.  In fact, I challenge anyone to still through this relatively short film (coming in at just under 80 minutes), without checking your watch at least once.  It's practically impossible.  That being said, this isn't a bad film, and could even be one of the best of the year.  Not only that, it's actually because of the fact that the first hour is so dull that the payoff feels so satisfying.  And that's exactly what makes this movie so chilling, by the time it reaches it's climax, we're are so glad that something is finally happening that we're actually rooting for the young mass murderers.Of course, this was just my take on it, and I'm sure that opinions will vary, but the simple fact that when the movie ended, I was forced into doing some introspection, makes this one of the most important films to come out of 2003.But, getting around to the question that white, upper-middle-class Americans have been asking themselves in the years since Columbine, &quot;Who's to blame?&quot;  Well, while there certainly aren't any pat answers offered here, you might be surprised to know that violent films and video games aren't let off the hook.  Not entirely anyway.  Now, don't get me wrong, this is a notion in which I've been extremely adverse to (and still am for that matter), but this movie actually made me acknowledge that they probably did play some small factor in desensitizing the young perpetrators of the rash of school shootings which plagued our country in the late 1990's.Let me explain.  This movie intends to push your buttons, and it does so by making you feel exhilarated when one would expect you're supposed to feel sad or horrified.  Which brings me to a confession.  On the morning of September 11, 2001, I felt more excited than anything else.  We've become such adrenalin junkies that instead of being terrified, I actually got high on the notion that anything could happen at any moment.  It felt like being in a movie to me.  Is this normal?  Probably not, but I'm not ashamed, and I actually suspect that more people probably felt the same.What does this have to do with the film?  The only way I can answer that is to say, I sensed that the characters in were as bored with their everyday routines as I was with watching them.  So, what do they do?  They go on a shooting spree.  Now certainly boredom this isn't a justifiable defense for these actions, but we're not talking about the &quot;real world&quot; here, we're talking about a world in which anything, and I mean anything, justifies our entertainment.  Whether it's watching the planet explode in &quot;Independence Day,&quot; or seeing Jim Cavizel tortured to death in &quot;The Passion of the Christ,&quot; this is the stated purpose of this medium in which I love.It reminds me of a quote from Sean Penn who, when he was on &quot;Inside the Actor's Studio&quot; said (and I'm paraphrasing here), &quot;If all you want is to be entertained, get a couple of hookers and a magic eight ball, because film is just too important to be wasted on that (popcorn entertainment) alone.&quot;Is he right?

This is one of those rare moments when I am really grateful for the 'fast-forward' button!""  Seriously, the movie itself was good, but you'll find that more than half of the movie is just watching the back of some kids' back.  Literally.  The camera follows one student around for what seems like an eternity, then when that finally ends, it just goes on to some other kid to follow, or the camera remains motionless while a bunch of people pass in front of the camera.One scene that really just gets me is when the camera is situated in the far back corner of a gym, and for what seems like hours, you watch a girl cross the gym floor.  Nothing else happens, she just takes her time crossing the gym floor...Does that really create atmosphere?  Maybe.  Sort of.  Kind of.  Not really necessary, though.  And, like I said, I used the fast-forward button a lot.  Not so much because the film itself is boring, but because those many scenes where you are literally just watching a kid walk can get kind of tedious--and you do not need to watch a kid walk all that time, you will understand just as much about the kid walking fast-forwarding as you will watching it at its' normal speed.Near the end, the movie really kicks up.  I couldn't leave my chair, it was just so interesting.  There was this one guy, though, near the end, that they introduce...I never really understood why he was introduced because he is only in for a short amount of time and literally adds nothing to the film.This film just does some strange things like that, that don't always make sense.  It does sort of add atmosphere, though.Overall, I would give this movie three stars for story and atmosphere...but just a few minutes into this movie, the same old camera techniques are used over and over again, that it just gets tedious, and you will be thankful for the little ""fast-forward"" button on your remote control...which is why I decided to give it two stars.To sum up, nice story, nice climax...just very repetetive.",2,Uh...weird.,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,2049,"['watching', 'found', 'thinking', 'Wow', 'one', 'rare', 'moments', 'when', 'am', 'really', 'grateful', ""'fast-forward"", 'button', 'Seriously', 'movie', 'was', 'good', ""'ll"", 'find', 'more', 'half', 'movie', 'just', 'watching', 'back', 'kids', 'back', 'Literally', 'camera', 'one', 'student', 'what', 'eternity', 'then', 'when', 'finally', 'just', 'other', 'kid', 'follow', 'camera', 'motionless', 'bunch', 'people', 'pass', 'front', 'camera.One', 'scene', 'really', 'just', 'when', 'camera', 'situated', 'far', 'back', 'corner', 'gym', 'what', 'like', 'hours', 'watch', 'girl', 'cross', 'gym', 'floor', 'Nothing', 'else', 'just', 'time', 'crossing', 'gym', 'floor', 'really', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'Maybe', 'Sort', 'Kind', 'Not', 'really', 'necessary', 'though', 'said', 'used', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'lot', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'boring', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'literally', 'just', 'watching', 'kid', 'walk', 'can', 'get', 'kind', 'tedious', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'watch', 'kid', 'walk', 'time', 'will', 'understand', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'kid', 'walking', 'fast-forwarding', 'will', 'watching', 'normal', 'speed.Near', 'end', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'could', ""n't"", 'leave', 'chair', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'interesting', 'was', 'one', 'guy', 'end', 'introduce', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'why', 'was', 'introduced', 'only', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'literally', 'nothing', 'film.This', 'film', 'just', 'strange', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'sort', 'add', 'atmosphere', 'though.Overall', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'same', 'old', 'camera', 'techniques', 'are', 'used', 'over', 'again', 'just', 'tedious', 'will', 'be', 'thankful', 'little', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'remote', 'control', 'why', 'decided', 'give', 'two', 'stars.To', 'sum', 'up', 'nice', 'story', 'nice', 'climax', 'just', 'very', 'repetetive']",Elephant

Because it's study hall, that's why---you know, with that [naughty word, rhymes with hitch] of a librarian who is already staring us down with her double-ot cobalt-blue stink-eye, and, well, because yes, I have a Mauser in my pants but yes, I'm also Happy to See You.Oh, and because what I'm about to say might shock you. You might scream, and that might start people running, and you know it's really hard to get a dead-aim on a moving target, no matter how easy it looks in the movies or when you're playing DOOM3 on your hopped-up godware system your folks plunked down 6K for over Christmas-break (damn, I meant to say 'Winter Holiday', guess that's another 180 demerits for me).But first---""Elephant"": Gus Van Sant's sly, sneaky little exegesis on the 1999 Columbine Massacre, is a masterpiece of cinematic understatement, and a first stab at answering the question no one dares ask: what do you get when you pack 13-year old children, hormones ablaze, into a concrete box for four years, at the very instant where their center of influence is shifting from teacher & parent to peers---and then expect them to Learn?Let's talk about High School. Four years where every single thing is both achingly important and relentlessly trivial. Four years where Social Darwinism is flipped off, where Evolutionary Gravity is reversed, and where those least able to make it after the Looking Glass that is High School lord it over everyone else.Face it: isn't that why High School reunions are such a deep well of nervous tension and gloating revenge? The supreme reversal of fortune, where the big guns are loaded up by the Survivors, where the class nerd rides back into town in a Rolls and the Jocks---good enough to rule their backwater gridirons, but not disciplined enough for the pro-leagues---are losing their hair and hawking insurance & used cars.That's what Gus Van Sant does in ""Elephant"", in which Van Sant deploys his camera as a kind of unobtrusive probe before the infamously opaque surface of a High School in its last serene minutes before Apocalypse. Van Sant wields his camera with a kind of spare, fluid, long-tracking elegance, using it as an instrument to pick a target and stay by his side, slipping back, or ahead, physically & temporally, using the camera as recording-device and scalpel and heightening both the banality and the creeping, mounting sense of malevolence and doom.It's an approach Richard Linklater used in ""Slackers"", and here it works doubly well: Van Sant's approach plunges madly along like a latter-day Rashomon, air-dropping the viewer into the field alongside characters we know only from a snippet of their actions, as they move through their cloistered environment, through sleek, gleaming, otherworldly hallways of their high school, in the instants before carnage and madness.American Higher Education may not produce scholars---hell, it chiefly rolls out illiterates---but along the way it does succeed at one thing: turning out Monsters. And why? Gus Van Sant doesn't get involved in that polemic---his camera is far too voyeuristic, to its credit, not intrusive, present merely to record---but I'll venture a guess: it's about that glorious little extra of our educational system called ""Socialization"". You know, the thing you're missing out on if you're home-schooled.I mean, c'mon---didn't you ever wonder why Dylan & Eric set off firebombs in the Cafeteria? I mean, by Odin's Flaming Nuggets, why the Cafeteria, of all the banal, innocent, wall-eyed places in the school? Why not napalm Detention, or the office of the Dean of Students, or the Pre-Calc Study Hall, surely all of them far better oubliettes of silent adolescent agony than the poor ol' Cafeteria, yes?No. No, I think not. You know why? Because the Cafeteria was, to the outcasts, to the pariah, to the Leper, and to the Royalty, the place where Court was held, where the All-Important Question was endlessly debated, reviewed, decided: Are you In? or Are you Out?Like Versailles in France, or the Tuilleries: where cliques formed, where the Nobility doled out its scant awards and ample scourges, Sheep on the Right, Goats on the Left. And God help you if you were a Goat.Follow me?Loosen up: why do you think Marat and Danton and Robespierre and his pack of Jacobins, Red in Tooth and Claw, tore through the palaces and the courts and the bastions of privilege---even unto the Church vestries!---with pitchfork and saber and torch? Because, Children, that was where the Royalty had its place, and where they---and their uncouth brothers and sisters of the People, could be kept out, walled off, pushed down.So they set fire to the Cafeteria. Call it a Revolution, in miniature, a little thinking globally, acting *way* locally, if you dig. Taking the Power Back.So back to Gus Van Sant: ""Elephant"" works because it keeps its distance. It stays back, it studies, it regards, and like any surgical instrument it can sometimes even strip away skin and flesh and muscle and tissue and bone, laying bare that which is caulked and covered up beneath the surface of pom-poms and gridiron warlords.I think our little conversation is done, and study hall is about to let out. I'm going to give you 20 seconds: on one side of that glass door is your vast, unbounded future---well, that is, until life gets complicated, until Evolutionary Gravity re-asserts itself, you get knocked up, dragged down, shoved into a cubicle and forced to work nights---and on this side of the table, with Thee & Me, you're looking into a full metal jacket: shark eye, black widow venom, the

This is the most boring movie I have ever seen in my life.  The movie plods along for what seems like nearly two hours, simply following random high school kids around as they walk the hallways and engage in meaningless conversation.  If you can stay awake long enough, something does finally happen when you realize a couple of kids are planning a school shooting.  However, if you make it this far through this colossal borefest, you'll be rooting for the shooters like I was.  At least they provided a spark of interest in this otherwise pointless movie.  No reason is given as to why they go on a killing spree, even though it's mildly implied that they were bullied.  Some random kid who we know absolutely nothing about(they only introduce him by showing the word ""Benny"" on the screen) inexplicably walks calmly through the halls as chaos ensues.  Just as you think he's about to sneak up on one of the shooters and disarm him, the shooter turns around and blows him away.  So much for a plot twist.  Eventually, one shooter shoots the other for no reason at all and then catches a couple hiding in a freezer.  Just before we find out if he kills them or not, the movie abruptly ends and the credits roll, leaving the viewer both confused and thankful at the same time.  No plot, no interesting characters, no good acting, no point.....you know, all those things that typically make for a good movie.

802167,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0001EFUFK,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 12]","- REVIEW1999 was a terrible year for Colorado.  A small high school named Columbine was forever defaced by two random outcasts packing heat.  It was a massacre beyond belief, with the outcasts committed the deaths of over 10 people, students and teachers alike.  The criminals were soon wasted by the SWAT and everything was apprehended, but no one, especially the students, can ever forget the bloodshed that flowed upon the floors of Columbine.  So how is it possible for first-time director Gus Van Sant to make the most tragic shooting in the school system look so incredibly boring?The badly-titled ""Elephant"" follows that morbid event, as you all know.  Instead of following how the tragedy came to be at the start like most based-on-true-events movie, this movie give different perspectives during the event.  About 9 students I think, the geeks, jocks, prissies, and the ones responible for the event, gives their own separate point-of-view (except for the 3 girls that share only one) of what's happening in front of them.  Sometimes, some of these characters interject when they cross paths to one's POV. Pratically, it's a typical nothing's-happening day for these kids...except when the shooting starts.  Each of these characters have their own first name, and interestingly enough, their first names are similar to their real names.I like the characters in story because they all look so convincingly real, the kind of students you would normally see in school.  This would have been a remarkable context to see these characters lived their lives right where the massacre, but as I find out, the only conclusive purpose for these kids to either die by the hands of the two outcasts or live and walk away with nothing.  This make caring for the characters highly irrelevant, even if it's intentional by the director's vision.  I DO have a complaint about one of the kids, who goes by Benny, who's got to be the dumbest black kid on earth who just blindingly walks towards his demise instead of hastenly avoiding it.  If he's based on a real murdered victim, I rather not go forward to disrespect the deceased.Mr. Van Sant has a unique direction in this film, which is also his most flawed.  He uses cinematography to follow the  character's perspective no matter he or she goes, with very little scene change and editing involved (think of this as that video from Xzibit, ""What you see is what you get"").  This makes the film's scenery more subtle and natural.  Van Sant also has a habit of leaving the camera fixed on one view to give it some kind of nonchalant view.  These are also the problems with this film because they were too many of these moments and they were WAY too long and subtle.The following-the-characters direction puts the word ""arbitrary"" on a high level, as I spend most of time watching characters being invisibly followed as they do mostly boring activities.  Adding to the drowsiness is the lengthy fixed camera scenes, which are either artistic expressive or incredibly lazy on the director's part; who actually wants to spend half a minute looking at the sky?  Even at 80 minutes, this movie has more unnecessary filler than the fourth season of InuYasha (anime fan, that I am).  One last complaint, what does the title ""Elephant"" have to do with the actual event?  Does it mean that big things can whimper at the sight of death?  What kind of subjective context is on Van Sant's easy-going mind when he came up with the title?By the time the shooting actually happens, and it's kinda graphic, I was too exhausted to feel devastated about it.  In my experience watching this film, it felt like being eight years old and watching those old educational videos in Science class; slow and it feels like work.  If the director wants to envision a tragic nilch tale of Columbine, he should think less ""art"" and more ""narrative.""  ""Elephant"" is a intriguing film focusing on the nature side of the tragedy, so I give it the benefit of the doubt.  It's worth seeing it once just to get it out of the way, but as flawed as it is, there's no incentive to give it a second viewing.This is Del Keyes, saying ""zzzzZZZZZ...goths shooting jocks...ZZZZzzzz""",3,An unrelated title to a relatively-dull movie,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,4180,"['REVIEW1999', 'was', 'terrible', 'year', 'Colorado', 'A', 'small', 'high', 'school', 'named', 'Columbine', 'was', 'forever', 'defaced', 'two', 'random', 'outcasts', 'packing', 'heat', 'was', 'massacre', 'belief', 'outcasts', 'committed', 'deaths', '10', 'people', 'students', 'teachers', 'alike', 'criminals', 'were', 'soon', 'wasted', 'SWAT', 'everything', 'was', 'apprehended', 'one', 'especially', 'students', 'can', 'ever', 'forget', 'bloodshed', 'flowed', 'floors', 'Columbine', 'So', 'how', 'possible', 'first-time', 'director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'make', 'most', 'tragic', 'shooting', 'school', 'system', 'look', 'so', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'badly-titled', 'Elephant', 'morbid', 'event', 'know', 'Instead', 'following', 'how', 'tragedy', 'came', 'be', 'start', 'most', 'based-on-true-events', 'movie', 'movie', 'give', 'different', 'perspectives', 'event', '9', 'students', 'think', 'geeks', 'jocks', 'prissies', 'ones', 'responible', 'event', 'own', 'separate', 'point-of-view', '3', 'girls', 'share', 'only', 'one', 'what', 'happening', 'front', 'Sometimes', 'characters', 'interject', 'when', 'cross', 'paths', 'one', 'POV', 'Pratically', 'typical', ""nothing's-happening"", 'day', 'kids', 'when', 'shooting', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'first', 'name', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'first', 'names', 'are', 'similar', 'real', 'names.I', 'characters', 'story', 'look', 'so', 'convincingly', 'real', 'kind', 'students', 'would', 'normally', 'see', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'remarkable', 'context', 'see', 'characters', 'lived', 'lives', 'right', 'where', 'massacre', 'find', 'out', 'only', 'conclusive', 'purpose', 'kids', 'die', 'hands', 'two', 'outcasts', 'live', 'walk', 'away', 'nothing', 'make', 'caring', 'characters', 'highly', 'irrelevant', 'even', 'intentional', 'director', 'vision', 'DO', 'have', 'complaint', 'one', 'kids', 'who', 'Benny', 'who', 'got', 'be', 'dumbest', 'black', 'kid', 'earth', 'who', 'just', 'blindingly', 'walks', 'towards', 'demise', 'instead', 'hastenly', 'avoiding', 'based', 'real', 'murdered', 'victim', 'rather', 'not', 'go', 'forward', 'disrespect', 'deceased.Mr', 'Van', 'Sant', 'unique', 'direction', 'film', 'also', 'most', 'flawed', 'cinematography', 'follow', 'character', 'perspective', 'matter', 'very', 'little', 'scene', 'change', 'editing', 'involved', 'think', 'video', 'Xzibit', 'What', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'film', 'scenery', 'more', 'subtle', 'natural', 'Van', 'Sant', 'also', 'habit', 'leaving', 'camera', 'fixed', 'one', 'view', 'give', 'kind', 'nonchalant', 'view', 'are', 'also', 'problems', 'film', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'moments', 'were', 'WAY', 'too', 'long', 'subtle.The', 'following-the-characters', 'direction', 'word', 'arbitrary', 'high', 'level', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'watching', 'characters', 'being', 'invisibly', 'followed', 'do', 'mostly', 'boring', 'activities', 'Adding', 'drowsiness', 'lengthy', 'fixed', 'camera', 'scenes', 'are', 'artistic', 'expressive', 'incredibly', 'lazy', 'director', 'part', 'who', 'actually', 'spend', 'minute', 'looking', 'sky', 'Even', '80', 'minutes', 'movie', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'filler', 'fourth', 'season', 'InuYasha', 'anime', 'fan', 'am', 'One', 'last', 'complaint', 'what', 'title', 'Elephant', 'have', 'do', 'actual', 'event', 'mean', 'big', 'things', 'can', 'whimper', 'sight', 'death', 'What', 'kind', 'subjective', 'context', 'Van', 'Sant', 'easy-going', 'mind', 'when', 'came', 'up', 'title', 'time', 'shooting', 'actually', 'kinda', 'graphic', 'was', 'too', 'exhausted', 'feel', 'devastated', 'experience', 'watching', 'film', 'felt', 'being', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'watching', 'old', 'educational', 'videos', 'Science', 'class', 'slow', 'work', 'director', 'envision', 'tragic', 'nilch', 'tale', 'Columbine', 'should', 'think', 'less', 'art', 'more', 'narrative', 'Elephant', 'intriguing', 'film', 'focusing', 'nature', 'side', 'tragedy', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', 'just', 'get', 'way', 'as', 'flawed', 'incentive', 'give', 'second', 'viewing.This', 'Del', 'Keyes', 'saying', 'zzzzZZZZZ', 'goths', 'shooting', 'jocks', 'ZZZZzzzz']",Elephant

I find it very interesting that reviewers that liked the film as well as viewers that did not like it seemed to agree that it was pointelss. To me, it was not pointless at all.Throughout the movie, we see several mundane interactions between several different groups of students, and we get to see these interactions from several different viewpoints. This helps paint the picture of an ordinary day in the life of a high school student. Early on we also see two teens dressed in camouflage with guns and we know something is going to go down. We get a glimpse of what happens to these kids during the course of their day. Nothing too out of the ordinary happens to these kids. Sure they are picked on at one point, but nothing too horrific that would justify shooting innocent people.And that is just the point I got from the movie. Whenever tragic events such as Columbine happen, we are very quick to try and figure out what caused them. Is it the kid's parents? Is it the fact they listen to Marilyn Manson? Is it the way they are treated at school? If not, then what? The kids in the film have very normal parents, one plays the piano (Beethoven, no less), and when they see Hitler on TV they are not even very aware of who he is. They know him by name, but not by his actions.This movie illustrates that some people, regardless of external factors, are just sociopaths and their actions cannot be explained by ""normal"" people. But that is just what I got out of it. This movie doesn't shove any beliefs into the viewer's face.

It's in response to not only that shooting but any threats that followed. After the Columbine massacre there has been an increase in school security and advocates in the schools to prevent bullying. This frightening depiction of a day in the life of some fated high school students not only responds to the act of bullying towards young men in schools, but also those that are of different sexualities and the pressures of societies on young men and women of today.The first time I watched this film I was in high school and the following day I definitely felt that haunted camera following me around. The steady cam following individuals is used throughout the film to give a sense of being within the school and being consistently watched and watchful. It's hard not to feel the pressures that the students feel. The focus on teachers or grown-ups is minimal and we rarely even see their faces. Instead we focus on a select few students, most of which become victims of the shooting that will inevitably come in the film. Two young men are victims of bullying and teasing despite the fact that they are smart, talented, and individuals with a great deal of depth. In a society where we only see the exteriors of things we are constantly looking over the interior turmoils that can happen within high school students.A great film for those critiquing our societies and wondering how we can make our schools better. We can't have lax teachers or allow bullying to perpetuate itself. The only thing I disliked about the film was the actors.

I agree with some of the reviewers that some of the walking scenes were rather tedious, and overdone. However, I feel that as a whole,  the film was very well-directed. While the dialogue between the characters in the film was empty, and lacking in much meaning, Van Sant did a great job of capturing their deeper selves through their body language. It makes you think about why they are the way they are. He didnt have to use much dialogue to convey this. I liked the  way he sequenced the scenes-all of it came together very well. I think this film is good if youre in the mood to zone out and be an observer. I disagree with the reviewer who said that if you are into Star Wars type films then you probably wont like this one. I know there are some people who probably only watch action films-but for the most part, people renting this film are obviously interested enough that they don't stick to one particular genre, or category.

So although I do agree it was extremely boring, there's no real need to point that out again.Meanwhile, reading the poor reviews of this movie (and I agree with them all for the most part), there was something I picked up on that no one else seemed to.  The lack of any real plot, the actual reason I believe the director didn't get into the ""lives"" and ""depth"" of the students, is because he wanted you to sympathize with the shooters.  He purposely showed just enough of these people, the hazing, the bad parenting, the oblivious teachers... to make you dislike them.At the end of the day (or lunch as the case may be), the shooters were only striking back at their tormentors, their parents, and their ""mentors"" who were supposed to help them and looked the other way.I don't condone such acts obviously, but I do insist that PARENTS be more involved with their children, and the people who are supposed to be looking out for their children while they're in school.  Would it kill you to ask your kid ""how was your day?"", ""are you being helped when you need it?"", and most of all ""are you being bullied?""I also insist you skip this movie.

Hmielewski,"[3, 4]","A means to an end to profit off of others' misfortunes: that is how I see this movie.It was, for the most part, a series of exaggerations to get at his own least-common-denominator point of view.(For example, the incredibly simplistic and primitive game one of the shooters was playing which seemed to be called: ""Shoot Random Civilians in the Back of the Head"").It came across as though he was trying to (and very insultingly) illustrate to the viewer that ""videogames cause violence.""But if you look at history, I think you'll find that violence came a few days before videogames.If Gus wanted to get that message across, he could have at least used better footage to articulate the idea (AT LEAST), rather than using what looked like a shoddily-assembled Flash animation.Furthermore, he fails to explore ideas like how his parents could have missed the mass of bullet holes in the garage (or was it basement? It's been awhile.) woodpile, and other examples abound (see previous post: Flat).Just random things like this...it seems he thinks we're too simple to question the various aspects of how insulting to our intelligence this movie actually is.But then again, the LCD (forementioned Least Common Denominator: my favorite term for simpletons) aspect of movies like this is drama.

It felt like you were watching a montage of high school life, yet not learning a thing. As I always maintain, films without characterization disappoint me and this is no exception. The film affords no insight into the lives of any of these characters and when the actual shooting takes place, you feel indifferent, like there is no danger or emotion involved. There were times when the film tried to create tension but it confused instead. For example, there is a scene where a girl starts running past two males and you think it's because she feels unsafe but really, she is only late for her library shift. Or when the shooters are killing but the tension created prior is negated by the predictability of the camera switching back to the killer as they fire.Another thing that really bothered me was how the first few students were presented like red herrings. I went through the first half of the film certain that the blonde male and the photographer were the killers.

As a result, I think people come to this movie expecting to find some kind of answers. It's natural. Normally, if you're going to make a film about a controversial, contemporary topic, you have some kind of ""message"" that you want to convey about it. ""Elephant"" doesn't really have a message, per se. It offers no explanation. It's just an observation. That can be very frustrating, although I found it fascinating.""Elephant"" is a day-in-the-life look at several individuals in a high school, including the two students who end up killing their fellow students. Apparently, the actors in this film are actually not actors at all and a lot of what occurs on screen wasn't scripted. And, in fact, there's a very natural/authentic feeling to the movie. There's no story arc or conflict-resolution, and no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys."" Just a bunch of students doing their thing on a normal day. The only thing that makes it NOT normal is that the viewer is very much aware that something horrible is about to happen, which lends a very creepy feeling to all this very mundane day-to-day stuff.Gus Van Sant includes some very interesting stuff in this movie without ever telling the viewer ""This is why these killings occur,"" or ""Here's the solution."" For example, at one point we follow three high school girls as they talk-talk-talk about this and that, eating lunch, wandering through the halls, finally entering the women's bathroom, each entering a private toilet stall, and then we hear them each making themselves vomit up their lunch. The whole thing is almost comical because it's done with so little ""drama."" It's obvious that this is a daily ritual, no big thing, and it barely interrupts their conversation. In a different movie, there would be some big dramatic music to set up this development, but in this movie it's just like, ""Yeah, so...?""But the fact that this is even included in the movie makes the viewer wonder, ""Is the director suggesting that the same societal values that leads to self-induced vomiting are ALSO somehow responsible for the killings that occur?"" But, there's no answer to that question. This is just one of a hundred different things that happen in this movie. You're left to draw your own conclusions.The thing that is so frustrating about this movie, I think, is that you keep wanting to be told whose fault it is. Should we blame the principal? Or the parents? Or society? Or... who? But there's no answer to that question.And that's what makes this movie so damn brilliant. To provide us with an answer would be to wrap the whole issue up for us in a tidy little box and let us get on with our day, content that that particular mystery has been solved.

802188,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B0001EFUFK,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[19, 22]","Elephant was a little too ""real"" for many tastes.  I didn't enjoy the film as I watched it the first time, but thought van Sant did (as always) a terrific job presenting what he wanted to present - if not necessarily my type of movie.  The film hasn't left me and the more I think about it - and rewatch it, the better it becomes.Initially I felt the sense of ennui was a tad overdone watching the back of a student's head as he slowly moves from point A to point B - sometimes for endless minutes on end the camera will not break from that vantage point - the back of a head.  The point seemed made both literally and succinctly the first time.  Nonetheless, this device frees the narrative and affords van Sant opportunity to move his film in non-linear directions so the glimpse of a face unseen earlier is now viewed in full relief, a snatch of conversation previously heard comes into focus - even if briefly.There are elements of the film that are touching and keenly observant.  While van Sant has typically focused on youth for his body of work, these elements are evident in all ages but noticeably and most strongly pronounced in youth, those hormone filled, confusing years where, completely unbeknownst to us, its victims, life is pretty much going to be the same, and one can change high school for the factory, the hospital, the law firm, the insurance company or wherever you spend your days and those with whom you spend them.As with life, some characters will stay with you, some you'd wish to know better, others (the three bulimic girlfriends) who natter on endlessly about nothing - and whose existence one forgets entirely - until the next encounter.There is more than a little heartbreak in Elephant.  Watching Alex pelted with spitballs made me cringe with remorse.  There is little reason to understand why Alex, and his sort of friend Eric, are losers.

802189,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0001EFUFK,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[0, 0]","In 2003 (or a few years before perhaps), Gus Van Sant got drunk on Bela Tarr films, which is a great intoxicant.  Tarr is a giant in cinema today, and his films are masterpieces of light, shadow, photography, acting, and some of the most extraordinary camerawork ever in cinema.  Gus made two films with an obvious debt to Tarr, Gerry and this film, Elephant.  Elephant is the better of the two films.Elephant has an eerie, haunting, etheral quality to it as Gus's camera glides through the high school.  He shows high school life to be tedious, silly, heartless, sad, occasionally funny, and eventually violent, as Gus emulates the Columbine massacre at the end of the film (even though very little violence is actually shown).  While the film isn't perfect, it's light years better than Gerry, which is a very misguided attempt to emulate Bela Tarr's style and substance (Van Sant got the style, but missed the substance).  Both Gerry and Elephant have improvised dialogue, and it's a major drawback to both films, but more so with Gerry.  Elephant's dialogue is forgettable, but luckily there's not much of it.  Much of the film isn't told with dialogue but with glances and wide shots, and Van Sant uses these tools quite effectively.  He also makes haunting use of Beethoven's Fur Elise, one of Beethoven's most famous works.  The film has a slow pace, but it's good for the material.Elephant is a good chapter in the Van Sant catalog, which has masterpieces (My Own Private Idaho), misguided films (Gerry), and absolute garbage (his remake of Pyscho).",4,"Haunting, strange, not perfect, but still very good....",1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,1557,"['2003', 'few', 'years', 'perhaps', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'got', 'drunk', 'Bela', 'Tarr', 'films', 'great', 'intoxicant', 'Tarr', 'giant', 'cinema', 'today', 'films', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'light', 'shadow', 'photography', 'acting', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'camerawork', 'ever', 'cinema', 'Gus', 'made', 'two', 'films', 'obvious', 'debt', 'Tarr', 'Gerry', 'film', 'Elephant', 'Elephant', 'better', 'two', 'films.Elephant', 'eerie', 'haunting', 'etheral', 'quality', 'Gus', 'camera', 'high', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'be', 'tedious', 'silly', 'heartless', 'sad', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'eventually', 'violent', 'Gus', 'Columbine', 'massacre', 'end', 'film', 'even', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'actually', 'shown', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'light', 'years', 'better', 'Gerry', 'very', 'misguided', 'attempt', 'emulate', 'Bela', 'Tarr', 'style', 'substance', 'Van', 'Sant', 'got', 'style', 'missed', 'substance', 'Gerry', 'Elephant', 'have', 'improvised', 'dialogue', 'major', 'drawback', 'films', 'more', 'so', 'Gerry', 'Elephant', 'dialogue', 'forgettable', 'luckily', 'not', 'much', 'Much', 'film', ""n't"", 'told', 'dialogue', 'glances', 'wide', 'shots', 'Van', 'Sant', 'tools', 'quite', 'effectively', 'also', 'haunting', 'use', 'Beethoven', 'Fur', 'Elise', 'one', 'Beethoven', 'most', 'famous', 'works', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'good', 'material.Elephant', 'good', 'chapter', 'Van', 'Sant', 'catalog', 'masterpieces', 'Own', 'Private', 'Idaho', 'misguided', 'films', 'Gerry', 'absolute', 'garbage', 'remake', 'Pyscho']",Elephant

But the worst part was, it could've been stopped. This movie is similar to the idea that shootings like this can be stopped, but then it's not. Some people complain that the movie was boring and prententious garbedge. I say that's not so. It all really depends on what you went through in high school and what you like in movies. I felt a link to some of the characters more than others, and maybe that's why I liked this movie so much.Mainly, it's about a simple, average high school day...Except that it's not. And as the day escalates, and you realize already what's going to happen to certain characters at certain times, it becomes evident how much the littlest things can make people snap. The thing I absolutely loved about Elephant was the fact it rewound certain events twice, sometimes three times and showed the each event from a different perspective. I just thought that was really cool. It made you see every aspect of one situation in a new light.This movie isn't action-packed. It's not a tense thriller. It's just a day in high school that goes wrong. The more you analyze the movie, the more you hate it ( I should know, I spent about a day and a half wondering why the kids massacred people like they did when I realized that it really doesn't matter.) This is more like a documentary. Which is why I found it nice. There wasn't music blaring. There wasn't serious chases or any of that. It was a quiet film.

802193,AH1M9A3JTV7C3,B0001EFUFK,Ian Muldoon,"[1, 2]","I imagine that this artifact will be studied at film schools as an object of aesthetic and ethical interest.  Aesthetically, it reminds us that film is an articfact and that the events depicted are being acted - it does this by creating a semblance of ""reality"" in the mis en scene for example where a camera follows a number of characters in long tracking shots through the mundane events of an actual high school on a typical high school day, then repeats them from another point of view.  This apparently Rashomon technique does not however alter the events in any way.  The long tracking shots behind walking students have the dual effect of at first creating some tension along with some irritation that characters rarely actually go anywhere dramatically speaking. The film also raises the question of the effect of tv viewing habits on individuals as one of the killers may have a fascination with Hitler documentaries.Ethically, the viewer is unable to determine any moral standing by the director except to note that it is apparently very easy to buy guns through the mail in the USA, that bullying may help to turn an individual homicidal, that it is very important, essential, that one has FUN, even when killing one's school mates. One disturbing note is that the two killers are depicted as possibly being homosexual which may undercut a serious point of the film that the killers are in many ways quite ordinary students.  Thus is it fair to imply from the film that classical music playing gay students are more prone to go on a killing spree than football playing straight life guards?  What was Timothy McVeigh? Thus the ethical question is whether as director of a work one is bound to take a moral stance,and whether by making a pseudo documentary one is excused from doing so.In short, the film raises lots of intriguing questions and is well worth seeing on that basis alone.

Other than that, the premise, structure and tone are utterly predictable.  We see a day in the life of contemporary youth or ""yout"" as Cousin Vinny would have said.  In a flat affect universe where children drive their drunk parents to work; where girls bicker about how hot a guy is and whether they will get into fights if found out they've been talking about him; where a pierced couple non-chalently asked a student photographer if they would like it if they take pics of them naked in a park; and a couple of students carrying a couple of sacks of combat fatigue-fashion statement duffle bags filled with unseen objects sticking obtrusively and obviously for the audience to see (they're not fencing equipment) we immediately learn (if we have any brain cells) that these two guys are going to pull a Columbine at the high school.  When they get down to business, the do so in the same flat-affect way the rest of the students respond to classroom discussions of gayness; girl/boy, boy/boy experimentation; the usual doofus school administrator with the snarly school papaish attitude toward a student being late.  When the two military manquee shooters start shooting, not only is there killing spree is not only a dull, matter-of-fact mission--carried out with the same enthusiasm of taking a calculus exam, but the victims more or less accept their fate as if to say, ""well, I guess it's our school's time to have a killing spree by a couple of the misguided among us."" So they get shot wanly and as they die, others respond to them wanly.  It's all done with this veneer of artsy, short on dialogue, long on slow-mo, minimal dialogue camera movement that tries to complement the actor's affectlessness by depicting the action in this non commital styled ""I'm out of here, but if I get murdered, at least I don't have to finish my science project next week"" choreography.

They especially praised Van Sant for refusing to provide any answers for the school shooting spree it depicts.  Sorry guys, you got it so wrong this time.  Yes, Van Sant is right not to present any answers to a problem that has none.  But shouldn't he have at least asked some relevant questions?What we have here is 60 minutes of absolutely nothing leading up to 15 minutes of vile and pointless carnage.  No plot, no character development of any kind, no humor, nothing.  The camera simply follows several high school stereotypes (the cute nerd, the photographer, the weirdo, the jock and his girlfriend, three anorexic bimbos, etc.) as they walk through the school during the same ten minute time span (viewed over-and-over again for one solide hour) then follows two homosexual psychopaths as they blow all but one away in sickening detail. Fade to Black.Actually, all through ""Elephant"" I kept thinking about the painter Jackson Pollock.  I can imagine Pollock accidentally spilling a couple of buckets of paint on a campus, then as a joke signing it and stuffing it away in storage.  After his death, this work of art is discovered and art critics everywhere spend hours studying Pollock's technique and declaring what was nothing but a mistake a brilliant work of art, while the public shakes their head in bewilderment.  That is ""Elephant"" in a nutshell.  It's as pointless as bad ""art"" can be, with no effort, thought or insight expended by its ""auteur"" director, who I wouldn't be surprised meant the whole thing as a sick joke and is sitting up in Portland laughing at those who think this pointless mess is somehow meaningful.As far as calling the killers homosexuals, of course I know Van Sant is gay and I doubt he really is trying to blame gays for school shootings.  But what then is the point of showing these two making out naked in the shower unless Van Sant is looking for blame (or a cheap thrill)?  It's confusing and insulting to gays who must be getting really tired of being scapegoated for all of society's problems.As for Gus Van Sant, this guy has to be the most overrated director of all time.  He's made two great movies (""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""Drugstore Cowboys""), one entertaining box office smash and its equally entertaining copycat (""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Finding Forrester"") and everything else has been absolute garbage (the ""Psycho"" remake, ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,"" ""Gerry,"" this debacle).  And poor Timothy Bottoms.  He starts his career with one of the greatest movies ever made (""The Last Picture Show"") which incidentally dealt sensitively and incisively with teenagers, and now in middle age he's relegated to playing second fiddle to a bunch of awful amateur teen actors from Portland, who wouldn't pass muster in a high school production of ""Bang, Bang You're Dead.""  Incidentally, buy the great Showtime version of ""Bang, Bang..."" starring Tom Cavanaugh and Ben Foster.  It covers the same ground, offers no easy solutions and gives us characters to care about to boot.Ironically, ""Elephant"" won grand prize at the Cannes film festival over Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River.""

Van Sant makes numerous textual references with the underlying theme taken on a very odd homosexual tone.He chooses to shoot most of these students from behind as they walk down corridors, have lunch at the cafeteria and come into brief contact with each other around this large high school.  He tries desperately to make it all seem so real, employing a group of high school kids to carry out the action in this film.The sequence of events are broken up, as they were in Memento, dovetailed together by recurring scenes.  There isn't any attempt to make sense of the scenes, or provide much of a motivating force for the two kids' murderous rampage in the end. It simply is what it is, and you can draw your own conclusions from it.The problem is that Van Sant utterly fails to allow the viewer to empathize with any of the persons in this film.  They are reduced to pixel images that kids shoot in video games.  The girls share a little bit of vacuuous gossip and the super jock tries to get his girlfriend to go four wheeling with him after school, but no real relationships are established, nor is there any sense that Van Sant wanted to.  In the end, the kids are picked off one by one as we would see in the school cameras capturing the horrifying events of that day.

I remember my heavy-set science teacher reduced to tears, and I remember the crude wooden gun I carved in Industrial Arts being taken away from me out of concern that it might lead to me killing people (telling them my father was a hunter did not help matters).  The Columbine Event was a significant part of my life, and there is a film to be made about it.  However, ""Elephant"" is not it.My primary complaint about Elephant is that it was so mundane.  Oh I do not mean that I wanted an explosion every five minutes, I mean I wanted dialogue and characterization.  I assumed the approach the director was going to take was a build-up of characters we (the audience) would care about, and then a shocking climax.  Instead I got stereotypes worse than in ""Scarecrow Gone Wild: He's the Death of the Party.""  We have a nerdy girl who works at the library, three attractive girls who throw up their lunch, two killers who have repressed homosexual tendencies and watch shows on the Nazis, a jock and his new attractive girlfriend, etc.  I hate calling a movie boring--it's so ignorant--but I was hard-pressed to get involved in this film.  There were no characters I liked, as a matter of fact there weren't any characters at all.  Just a few cariactures and cardboard cutouts.The style of direction was also grating on the nerves and the eyes.  While a long-take can be great (i.e. Goodfellas) on its own, watching long-take after long-take was exceptionally annoying.  It got so bad that I started looking forward to cuts, which heretofore I took for granted.  Van Zant seems to be in love with every shot, being pretentiously artsy for the sake of doing so, and it was exceptionally irritating.  Further, no one seemed to care at all when two crazed killers were running amuck with deadly weaponry.  If someone could explain the actions of the black guy at the end (Benny?), you have my email.

Scene.Kid strolls through courtyard aimlessly.  Scene.Kid shuffles solo across the gym floor.  Scene.Unfortunately, this isn't a zombie movie, and that's how the first half of the movie drags on.  Shot in uninteresting bursts of wandering, meandering, and meaningless dialogue (it felt like watching The Hills), the framing of the shots isn't bad, but the directing is clearly amateur.  I suppose one could conclude the shots have something to do with the isolated feeling of awkward, pubescent high school years, but that's a weak cop-out.The cast is very young and fresh, providing a solid performance.  None really stand out from the others, but they're all competent.  It's like being a fly on the wall in High School.  It's just that the script is incredibly boring and slow.  This movie is nearly guaranteed ennui.  The character development is absolutely nonexistent.  It's silent film nonexistent.  There is insignificant explanation of why the kids snap.The score is pretentious and completely distracts from whatever message is being unconvincingly delivered.  The best music of the movie is when one of the troubled kids plays Beethoven's Fur Elise.Children today have weak constitutions; their psyche has become fragile from years of coddling, undeserved affirmations, an entire lifetimes of being told that everyone is a winner, everyone is a special, unique butterfly.  Well, guess what?  Life often sucks, and it's better to overcome fears, difficulties, and struggles with determined will power and thicker skin.  Sticks and stones, people.  Therein lies the problem with Elephant.  Instead of playing the ""these kids are so depressed, alone, and have such hard lives""-card, maybe something positive could have been presented for them to latch on to.  Rather than a justification for horrible, unforgivable, cowardly actions, maybe an alternative could have been presented.Simply put, the film is incomplete and flawed.

The director does not tell us why this happens or show us some insight into the characters, he doesn't need to and he shouldn't.  Would you prefer that we be given a cast of bullies so we can cheer them on (the shooters) and ""understand"".  Am  the only person sick and tired of seeing films like ""Bring it On"" or even ""Mean Girls"" (which I liked) as the only movies about teens?  These were real kids, not 20 something's playing kids.  Bravo.  Life is not a music video and neither is adolescence.  Of course it is an isolated incident (Columbine) but look at how the media stirred it up, this film only offends people who wanted to see a rehash of ""Taxi Driver"" or some death metal video with a script. No one should try and tell us ""Why"" Columbine happened, all they will do is use this slaughter as a reason to grind there respective axes. The Christian fundamentalist will decry the breakdown of discipline and the banishment of God from the classroom.  The liberal will whine about the lack of funding for music and art ""Surely this gifted young artist would have preferred to paint and play then to murder"".  Nonsense, we can never know for sure why such a thing happened and we should  not be so arrogant as to try to.

802203,AJ4CR2LM73UCK,B0001EFUFK,"J. COSBY ""ZePequeno""","[3, 6]","Alright, I readily recognize that this film is probably not the best of the recent wave of school-shooting films, but seeing all this bogus negative press for ""Elephant"" really disheartens me.We all know how it swept Cannes, but is that really a surprise...?  Any film made by Americans about how bad and violent America is, is immediately sucked off by French film critics solely for the purpose that it makes America look bad.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and its subsequent reception at Cannes is the ultimate example of that.  My question is: since when has America ever really looked good to foreigners?I'll be the first to shout that ""Elephant"" is not as realistic as it ought to be, however unless YOU PERSONALLY attended Columbine High School in Littleton, CO on that fateful day of 4/20/99, you effectively cannot state accurate assumptions of realistic teenage behavior.  Sorry, you're not qualified.  I know I'm not.1) the big black kid strolling nonchalantly as the hallway burns... was probably gonna try to talk him into giving up the gun instead of just jumping an armed assailant, that would've been a stupider move.2) the endless piano playing... the point of this scene is what the player does as he finishes the phrase while his buddy jumps on the laptop.  do you remember?  the duality of killers.I'll make this review quick.  ""Elephant"" is all about atmosphere, not plot.  Shortcuts are taken with the gay display, Fuhrer propoganda films, violent video games, etc.  It seems a too neat and tidy, maybe repetitive package.  What you are missing out on is that Harris Savides' half-lit and HAUNTING photography attempts to reconstruct not the event, but the environment that became victim to the event.  To this end, I found the photography spiritual, the acting broad (non-professionals, mind you), the crescendo is not intense because of the 15-minute time frame that loops back on itself.Even after all that, I was thoroughly immersed in - at least - my high school all over again for roughly 80 minutes thanks to ""Elephant.""  The superficial girls spouting off how many grams of fat in salad dressing; the unattractive, quiet girl working the library; the gay photographer working on his portfolio; the skater kid with a drunken dad he's ashamed of; the preppie couple getting ready for forerunning... it's all real.  They were all in my high school, anyway...  I knew most of them.Alright, the endless shots... people, the first thing any Film 101 instructor ought to tell you is that long-takes (put to extensive use in this film) are presented dependent upon story progression and emotional conveyance.  Don't get bored with the character that the camera is following, that's not why the camera focuses on him to begin with.  Instead, observe the area around him as he walks through it.  High school all over again... you've just gotta pay close attention.Sorry, this one tries to make you think and recall, not help you get your kicks as you mentally plaster your face over the killers' and enjoy some fantasy-revenge played out on a movie screen, just so you can't get in trouble.  That's a selfish and disturbing attitude to have.  The final shot sums up everything Van Sant attempted to hint at beforehand: this a lyrical, dreamy lament seeped in uncertainty.

802205,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0001EFUFK,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 7]","The atrocity that unfolded at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado on April 20, 1999 stuns the mind. Even now, more than five years after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold donned their black trench coats and went on a killing spree, we don't fully understand what motivated the pair to embark on a nightmare. The media, always quick to swoop down on a tragedy in order to throw blame around (and score some high ratings in the process), pointed their fingers at a host of social and psychological factors. Violent videogames, absentee parents, National Socialism, death metal music, bullying--all of these reasons, and a few more, issued forth from the mouths' of the ""experts"" consulted in the wake of the tragedy. Then the conspiracy nuts weighed in, those misguided, endearing souls who throw up web pages explaining the ""real"" story behind any national calamity. According to these crackpots, it's an absolute fact that Harris and Klebold had several as yet unknown accomplices helping them place the homemade bombs around the school. If you look hard enough, you might even see a few sinister references to an alien (as in extraterrestrial) influence in the disaster. Amazing, isn't it? Perhaps we will never understand why Columbine occurred.Nevertheless, several films offer opinions on the tragedy. Gus Van Sant, a successful filmmaker with movies such as ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""My Own Private Idaho"" under his belt, submits ""Elephant"" for our perusal. Why choose ""Elephant"" for the title? Considering the structure of the movie, I imagine it has something to do with the ancient story concerning a group of blind men asked to describe an elephant. Each man touches a different part of the animal and ""sees"" it according to that specific body part. Only by taking all of their perceptions together do the men arrive at an accurate, or more accurate, description of the elephant. Van Sant does the same thing with his Columbine reenactment by looking at the events leading up the shooting from different students' perspectives. As the film begins, we meet blond headed John McFarland (John Robinson) driving to school with his father (Timothy Bottoms). Dad's been hitting the bottle again, so we see the car weaving through the streets and sideswiping parked vehicles. John and his father discuss firearms and hunting, and when the boy arrives at school he calls for someone to come down and drive dad home. As unpleasant as John's morning seems to be, his intoxicated father keeps John out of the classroom and eventually outside of the building when Eric (Eric Deulen) and Alex (Alex Frost) arrive.Eric and Alex are the two preparing to massacre their fellow students. They tell John to stay away because ""something big is going to happen,"" or words to that effect. Indeed. Instead of taking us straight to the killings, Van Sant shifts focus and shows us the day as it unfolds through the eyes of other students. We follow student photographer Elias (Elias McConnell) as he walks to school, takes pictures of fellow students, and visits the photography lab. He even briefly stops to take a picture of John in the hallway as that student heads back outside to check on his father. Then he goes to the library. Meanwhile, Michelle (Kristen Hicks) survives another day of gym class--her instructor hassles her for not wearing shorts despite previous warnings--and eventually makes her way over to the library where she has a job shelving books. Jordan (Jordan Taylor), Brittany (Brittany Mountain), and Nicole (Nicole George) stand around in the hallway gossiping and ogling a guy who walks by with his girlfriend before heading over to the cafeteria for lunch. They happen to observe John outside talking to Eric and Alex but don't think anything of it as they depart for the bathroom for a quick purge (!) and more gossip. Van Sant fills the screen with other images--a GLAAD meeting at school, a black athlete named Bennie, and intimate scenes of the killers at home preparing for their destiny.""Elephant"" seems to generate both good and bad reactions. Critics berate Van Sant for constructing a film that doesn't do anything, that doesn't stake out a position concerning why two kids would want to harm their fellow classmates. They hate the meandering pace of the film, too. In some respects, these detractors make an important point: we don't find any absolute answers in ""Elephant"" explaining why the killings happen, although Van Sant throws out a whole bunch of possible motivations ranging from easy access to firearms to videogames to National Socialism. Let's face facts, though: this film was never going to solve the permanent enigma surrounding Columbine. We might come closer to the truth by looking at the events through several sets of eyes--more hands on the elephant if you will--but the problem is that we don't know what this particular animal looks like in the first place. We are all blind men grasping for answers in the case of Columbine. Personally, I liked the film. The sense of palpable dread I felt watching Alex and Eric drive to school on doomsday is one I have never felt with any other film. The massacre is horrific, not because it's gory but because it looks and feels mundane and matter of fact.I thought ""Elephant"" was a good film, as good a film could be when dealing with such horrific subject matter. It's certainly a better effort than the awful ""Duck: The Carbine High Massacre."" I went into Van Sant's film after hearing all about it, so I knew about the plot and the multi-layered narrative ahead of time. I think the film would work much better for a viewer who went in not knowing anything about the tragedy about to unfold. ""Elephant"" is a haunting, waking nightmare that makes you think long after the conclusion.",4,Horrific,1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,5775,"['atrocity', 'unfolded', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School',

802206,A1G1PX4U6RSZEA,B0001EFUFK,Jeremy P,"[2, 6]","Van Sant spends too much time articulating absolutely nothing, which ultimately conveys no message.  Sadly, Columbine ALREADY happened.  Predictably, I knew the outcome of the story after the first 5 minutes into the film.  This movie would of been powerful, raw, in your face truth of reality IF Columbine never existed, however knowing Columbine existed didn't really help.  I was really expecting more dialogue in this movie versus camera angles.  Van Sant spent too much time tinkering with the camera settings than he did with character development.  I was begging for some sort of introduction to at least one of the characters in order to prepare me for a sad ending, but that whole idea was never introduced in this film.  All I was prepared for were two kids entering a typical public school and killing people at random.  Furthermore the whole shower scene showing both killers bathing together and kissing each other wasn't necessary.  It seems to me Van Sant loses track of the storyline of this film, and tries his best to satisfy all the artsy fartsy viewers.  In order to satisfy those viewers, he gives up on creating a more structured story-line, but yet unique camera angles?  Obviously that turns problematic trying to satisfy a certain jaura of people.  In conclusion, I believe this movie would of been a bit more interesting if we learned any further information on at least one of the characters, I wouldn't even care if we were enguled in the character of the goddamn principle.  Nonetheless Van Sant strays away from that concept, and spends his time creating something very predictable.

802207,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0001EFUFK,J from NY,"[4, 6]","I'm not expert on film, nor do I favor trendy ""minimalistic"" type movies.  I find them boring when used in an overtly artistic way, and as a rule of thumb they misfire.  I don't even like Gus Van Sant's work that much.  ""Good Will Hunting"" was corny and overrated; he stained the integrity of Alfred Hitchcock and the horror genre with his grotesque and embarrassing re-make of ""Psycho"". So I have no biases one way or the other when I say that this is a great movie.""Elephant"" is not obvious either in content or pace, and is an extremely subtle exercise in the mysterious reality of the most awful things.  It is obvious, however, that Van Sant spent a lot of time researching the Columbine High School Massacre, although I wouldn't box this in with ""movies about Columbine"".  It has a reality all it's own, although this reality does extend to what happened in Littleton in a major way.The film opens on a note of quiet dysfunction, with a drunken Timothy Bottoms attempting to drive his blonde haired son, John, to school.  When he shows up late with an excuse, the principal detains him and gives him detention. This nonchalant kid does a good job of simply being a nonchalant kid, and there isn't much ""acting""; the camera follows him in a serene way through the halls of his school, the people, places and things he sees on a day to day basis.  With what I think was Van Sant's purpose, this is perfect, but in the way of showing the reality of high school he is a little TOO underdramatic, whereas most hollywood garbage makes everything more glamorous and segregated than it really is.  That said, I prefer Van Sant's perceptual error.John is different from the other characters we are introduced, though.  Eric and Alex, the two boys who go on a twenty minute massacre, choose for some reason that is not explained to spare him.  This parallels almost exactly what the shooters at Columbine high school did with one of their friends, although John is never shown socializing with them or even noticing them in passing.  They simply say: ""Get the f**k out of here and don't come back.  Some heavy sh*t's going down.""  We hear Eric (who appears to be the mastermind of the operation) say this three times, and the tone in his voice is not homicidal, despairing or suicidal, merely matter of fact and slightly urgent.  Van Sant strips away the drama we read into horrific incidents like Columbine to reveal the even uglier reality of what actually is: utter senselessness.In this scene John is always saying hello to a dog named Boomer right before the pair walk up, clad in fatigues and carrying bags.  We see them approach in the distance as John is simply lost in his own orbit, living his life.  It is as if Van Sant is trying to strip away all our pretenses, our collective urge toward dichotomies like good and evil, the pastiche drama veiled over these incidents: evil approaches as innocuously and numbly as anything else, sometimes two goofy kids in combat gear.  We will not, no matter how hard we try, always be able to see it coming.The absurd explanations for school massacres are parodied as Eric plays piano beautifully while Alex enjoys a violent video game. It is almost bleakly amusing to see all our grand explanations for demented incidents--video games, movies, etc--discarded in this manner. At one point they watch something on the Third Reich, but they might as well be watching an infomercial. One can enjoy the ""highest"" delights of our culture and still be a budding killer. They are so forgotten and unnoticed, so despairingly alienated, that they themselves don't know.  This is the point.He has captured a piece of harsh reality here.  The last twenty minutes are as hard to watch and heart wrenching a piece of film as I've seen.  It is so real that it is difficult to watch.

Or better yet, click the ""Add to Shopping Cart"" tab.However, if you have a low tolerance for tear-your-eyes-out-monotony: Fair warning. There are scenes in ""Elephant"" that will leave you blind. These scenes begin shortly after the opening credits and continue for approximately 80 minutes.I had some hope when it started out: Sounds from a playground accompanied a time-lapse shot of clouds moving past. Then we see a scene where an obviously-drunk driver is attempting --poorly-- to navigate a Mercedes up a tree-lined street. The passenger, a high-school kid, demands that his drunk dad pull over: HE'LL drive the remainder of the way to school.We get to school. There are about 9 people milling around. The school consists of multiple buildings sprawled on a lush campus that appears to be the size of Delaware. There are perhaps 17,000 classrooms. Most are empty. The few kids we see are staggeringly annoying.Then the movie's director takes us on the first of many, many, oh-my-god-WAY-too-many Steadicam shots, as we follow oh-so-closely behind some student as he--or she---or they---walk from one end of the campus to the other, passing through 853 buildings on the way.Then we get to meet some new annoying people. And the blond kid (the one with the drunk dad), leaves...just a half hour after he arrives. He goes outside and briefly plays with a border collie.****ASIDE: I remember MY High School Days... they ALWAYS kept a fresh supply of border collies, labrador retrievers and beagles on campus, just in case we got the urge to duck out of class and play with a dog.  END ASIDE****Yeah. Right. Anyway, by the last half hour, I was HOPING someone would get shot.Did it mean that this was just a routine day, and that you can't predict or prevent such senseless and murderous acts? Maybe. But maybe it would have been a better movie if we actually were drawn in enough to care about the victims. I didn't care. They were cardboard cutouts.  The shooters were essentially enjoying target practice. As one of them said to the other shortly before the bloodshed began: ""most importantly: have fun!""The reality is that you CAN predict who the shooters might be. In ""Elephant,"" we see a couple of ""quiet, brooding"" kids  ...and one of them has food thrown on him in the cafeteria. SHOOTER. There's also a girl. A  homely, talks-to-no one, uncomfortable-in-her-own-skin loner. *NOT* a shooter. (Here's a clue. She's a girl... girls aren't shooters.)So I guess the laughable irony here is that this artsy-fartsy movie that is so raved about by people who would likely be APPALLED by real-life profiling, is actually an argument *for* profiling... because the perps sure fit ""the profile"" as it is often assumed to be.- Jonathan Sabin",1,Monotonous monotonous monotonous monotonous monotonous monotonous monotonous monotonous monotonous,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,2918,"['thought', 'headline', 'was', 'artsy', 'then', 'perhaps', 'should', 'ignore', 'one-star', 'rating', 'given', 'only', 'zero', 'stars', 'not', 'option', 'RUN', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'rent', 'film', 'better', 'yet', 'click', 'Add', 'Shopping', 'Cart', 'tab.However', 'have', 'low', 'tolerance', 'tear-your-eyes-out-monotony', 'Fair', 'warning', 'are', 'scenes', 'Elephant', 'will', 'leave', 'blind', 'scenes', 'begin', 'shortly', 'opening', 'credits', 'continue', 'approximately', '80', 'minutes.I', 'had', 'hope', 'when', 'started', 'out', 'Sounds', 'playground', 'accompanied', 'time-lapse', 'shot', 'clouds', 'moving', 'past', 'Then', 'see', 'scene', 'where', 'obviously-drunk', 'driver', 'attempting', 'poorly', 'navigate', 'Mercedes', 'up', 'tree-lined', 'street', 'passenger', 'high-school', 'kid', 'drunk', 'dad', 'pull', 'HE', 'drive', 'remainder', 'way', 'school.We', 'get', 'school', 'are', '9', 'people', 'milling', 'around', 'school', 'multiple', 'buildings', 'sprawled', 'lush', 'campus', 'be', 'size', 'Delaware', 'are', 'perhaps', '17,000', 'classrooms', 'Most', 'are', 'empty', 'few', 'kids', 'see', 'are', 'staggeringly', 'movie', 'director', 'first', 'many', 'many', 'oh-my-god-WAY-too-many', 'Steadicam', 'shots', 'follow', 'oh-so-closely', 'student', '-or', '-walk', 'one', 'end', 'campus', 'other', 'passing', '853', 'buildings', 'way.Then', 'get', 'meet', 'new', 'annoying', 'people', 'blond', 'kid', 'one', 'drunk', 'dad', 'just', 'half', 'hour', 'outside', 'briefly', 'plays', 'border', 'collie', '****ASIDE', 'remember', 'MY', 'High', 'School', 'Days', 'ALWAYS', 'kept', 'fresh', 'supply', 'border', 'collies', 'labrador', 'retrievers', 'beagles', 'campus', 'just', 'case', 'got', 'urge', 'duck', 'class', 'play', 'dog', 'END', 'ASIDE****Yeah', 'Right', 'Anyway', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'was', 'HOPING', 'someone', 'would', 'get', 'shot.Did', 'mean', 'was', 'just', 'routine', 'day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'predict', 'prevent', 'such', 'senseless', 'murderous', 'acts', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'actually', 'were', 'drawn', 'enough', 'care', 'victims', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'were', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'shooters', 'were', 'essentially', 'enjoying', 'target', 'practice', 'one', 'said', 'other', 'shortly', 'bloodshed', 'began', 'most', 'importantly', 'have', 'fun', 'reality', 'CAN', 'predict', 'who', 'shooters', 'might', 'be', 'Elephant', 'see', 'couple', 'quiet', 'brooding', 'kids', 'one', 'food', 'thrown', 'cafeteria', 'SHOOTER', 'also', 'girl', 'homely', 'talks-to-no', 'one', 'uncomfortable-in-her-own-skin', 'loner', '*NOT*', 'shooter', 'Here', 'clue', 'girl', 'girls', 'are', ""n't"", 'shooters', 'guess', 'laughable', 'irony', 'here', 'artsy-fartsy', 'movie', 'so', 'raved', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'APPALLED', 'real-life', 'profiling', 'actually', 'argument', '*for*', 'profiling', 'perps', 'sure', 'fit', 'profile', 'often', 'assumed', 'be.-', 'Jonathan', 'Sabin']",Elephant

I'm Kind Of A ...","[2, 8]","I understand that people want to be unique and make films that are different from others but elephant is just in another league and takes reality to another level. For one thing yes filming children walk around in a school all day and showing how some get picked on and some are popular and est. is very realistic but the reason films aren't made exactly like real life is because it's very boring that way. When I watch a movie I really don't feel the need to see some guy walk in a circle for 15 minutes, maybe he did that in real life but who wants to see him do that. The movie needed to show the kids emotions develop over some time because if you don't exactly know what the movie is about then your watching it and wondering why two kids kill off most of a school just because for one day people were throwing wet paper wads at them.Elephant is very slow and boring and if you don't agree with what I'm saying then show it to a class of high school student's and count how many of them have actually paid attention or are awake at the end of the movie, I can guarantee your only going to be counting for about 2 seconds. The teacher will learn the lesson but the student's won't even know what movie was playing. I have also seen a lot of reviewers get negative votes on this film and I don't know if it's because people love this director or they saw the film and got something from it that reviewers didn't. I'm 17 and I have gone through today's high school system so I know that this movie was done lazy and sloppy, It doesn't explain anything. It's different if it was said that these two kids were just craving blood and did what they did but from the little bit that was shown you come to say I think those kids got picked on so that's why they're doing this. This is not a documentary on a true story it is a movie and a half done movie.

Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" was laurelled with the Palm d'Or because it offers no explanation, no justification, and no insight into the tragedy of the Columbine massacre when two estranged teenager murdered 13 innocent lives. ""Elephant"" is not about Columbine but on another high school, which further implies Van Sant's message that a tragedy like this can occur anywhere else at anytime. That is partially true but very insulting because these sorts of event shouldn't just pop out at any random time and location. To offer no hint of reason or justification is understandable, yet irresponsible on Van Sant's part.The first hour of this film we witness numerous tracking of the characters as they pass through empty hallways while we're just lagging behind. We first track John (John Robinson) being driven to school by his hammered dad. They stop, John tells him to get out and sit on the passenger side, John gets behind the wheel, and then more tracking. Then a slew of characters begin to appear on screen, going about in their normal lives like normal teenagers, taking advantage of their supposed safety while we in the audience know something is brewing. We follow some characters individually through flashbacks that run into other characters we eventually meet or have already met. Why does Van Sant show them in particular? I guess if perpetrators are randomly selected than so are their victims. Nothing has set rules.Stanley Kauffmann of ""The New Republic"" labeled ""Elephant"" as a ""braggart piece of empty exhibitionism"" and I am inclined to agree. The first hour is so meaningless and bland that there is no reason to watch this movie, which is already aside from the fact that Van Sant intentionally offered no discernment to this matter. ""Elephant"" is all about fashioning the exterior as Van Sant plays with the camera by seamlessly tracking its players and shooting long shots. The cinematography is lusciously solemn and Van Sant tries to fill the emotionless gaps with classical scores of Beethoven but it merely widens it. Van Sant flaunts ""Elephant"" for being unconventional and becomes so preoccupied with it that he leaves it hollow.

802217,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0001EFUFK,Kenji Fujishima,"[9, 12]","Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT is ostensibly about the Columbine incident; that is certainly what spurred me on to watch the film in the first place. But when I saw this film the first time, the thing I responded to most was its elegant recreation of high school. The atmosphere, the rhythms, the people---it captures all these things with uncanny accuracy, and it certainly brought me back to my own high school experience. If nothing else, it's an objective portrait of a normal high school and various characters that attend it on what appears to be a normal day until two of its characters (both outsiders, of course) tragically shake it up with pointless death and destruction. It's a movie that merely looks on dispassionately as people talk and things both significant and insignficant happen at this high school. It refuses to make cheap melodrama out of any of the situations or characters, and it absolutely refuses to provide any reassuring answers to explain what could have lead up to this terrible incident. Perhaps there simply aren't any easy answers to be found (despite what politicians, activist groups, and other fearmongers have offered in the past).A movie about the Columbine incident was bound to be made eventually---it is too disturbing and has caused too much discussion for it to be ignored by the cinema. This was the probably the only way it could be done without cheapening it in any way. Other films might take the incident and fashion a big subjective statement out of it, like Michael Moore did with his illuminating Academy Award-winning documentary BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. ELEPHANT takes a more objective fictional route, and anything less than the definitive film about Columbine, now and in the near future, would be hard to imagine. But to label it simply a &quot;Columbine film&quot; is too limiting: it also works as an evocative portrait of the high school experience, and it does so in a manner that could be best described as undramatic yet strangely hypnotic.

802219,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B0001EFUFK,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[1, 5]","It is hard to know what Gus Van Sant had in mind when creating the film ""Elephant."" Here is a film about a 'typical' day in the life of a high school that - unbeknownst to all but two students - will culminate in a school shooting. Most of the film centers on the mundane interaction between an alternating cast of students. But what was Van Sant's intent with the film? As witnessed by the very mixed reviews, it is a question that - like the film he created - has no satisfactory answer.Here is what is certain. We get to know none of the characters in the way that most films allow characters to be known. We see them only from a distance - very superficially. Even the shooters are presented in a very distant and illusive way that never lets us peer, as we desperately want to, into their skulls.My guess is that this was deliberate on Van Sant's part (which will not prevent it from being irritating to many veiwers). As a high school teacher myself, I find it plausible that Van Sant only shows characters superficially to emulate what high school actually IS like. As one of the characters innocuously says halfway through the film: ""I mean, how can you know someone's spirit?"" Was that line, I wondered, really innocuous? Or was that the explanation for what some call the film's ""pointlessness"" (and what others celebrate as its ""realism""?)All that is to say that if you want a character study, Elephant is certainly not your film.So, why did I give it three stars despite the fact that - contra many reviewers - I think the tedium was a necessary part of the film? Because improvising a script takes much more talent than some expect and much more talent than these actors - none of whom are experienced - had.Particularly in a film where chatty conversation is supposed to sound like chatty conversation, too much of the improvised dialogue seemed awkward, self-conscious, and forced. Again, as someone who is in high schools all day, I can attest that these conversations fail to replicate the feel of 16-year-olds-in-the-hall conversation. And as these conversations constitute the backbone of the film, the film suffers tremendously because of it - enough to cost it two stars.So despite the fact that I think Van Sant and crew got the overall feel right and were correct not to let us get too deep into explanations and character study, the film ultimately falls on the clumsy dialogue.If you want an explanation for school shooting, go see Michael Moore's ""Bowling at Columbine"" amongst others. If you want to see what the day in the life of a high school shooting probably looks like in actuality, see elephant. Just keep in mind that actual high schoolers in actual high schools produce better dialogue than this film was able to concoct.",3,High School Life as Seen From the Halls!,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,2757,"['hard', 'know', 'what', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'creating', 'film', 'Elephant', 'Here', 'film', ""'typical"", 'day', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'unbeknownst', 'two', 'students', 'will', 'culminate', 'school', 'shooting', 'Most', 'film', 'centers', 'mundane', 'interaction', 'alternating', 'cast', 'students', 'what', 'was', 'Van', 'Sant', 'intent', 'film', 'witnessed', 'very', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'question', 'film', 'created', 'satisfactory', 'answer.Here', 'what', 'certain', 'get', 'know', 'none', 'characters', 'way', 'most', 'films', 'allow', 'characters', 'be', 'known', 'see', 'only', 'distance', 'very', 'superficially', 'Even', 'shooters', 'are', 'presented', 'very', 'distant', 'illusive', 'way', 'never', 'peer', 'desperately', 'want', 'skulls.My', 'guess', 'was', 'deliberate', 'Van', 'Sant', 'part', 'will', 'not', 'prevent', 'being', 'irritating', 'many', 'veiwers', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'find', 'plausible', 'Van', 'Sant', 'only', 'characters', 'superficially', 'emulate', 'what', 'high', 'school', 'actually', 'IS', 'like', 'one', 'characters', 'innocuously', 'halfway', 'film', 'mean', 'how', 'can', 'know', 'someone', 'spirit', 'Was', 'line', 'wondered', 'really', 'innocuous', 'was', 'explanation', 'what', 'call', 'film', 'pointlessness', 'what', 'others', 'celebrate', 'realism', 'say', 'want', 'character', 'study', 'Elephant', 'certainly', 'not', 'film.So', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'fact', 'contra', 'many', 'reviewers', 'think', 'tedium', 'was', 'necessary', 'part', 'film', 'improvising', 'script', 'much', 'more', 'talent', 'expect', 'much', 'more', 'talent', 'actors', 'none', 'whom', 'are', 'experienced', 'had.Particularly', 'film', 'where', 'chatty', 'conversation', 'supposed', 'sound', 'chatty', 'conversation', 'too', 'much', 'improvised', 'dialogue', 'seemed', 'awkward', 'self-conscious', 'forced', 'Again', 'someone', 'who', 'high', 'schools', 'day', 'can', 'attest', 'conversations', 'fail', 'replicate', 'feel', '16-year-olds-in-the-hall', 'conversation', 'conversations', 'constitute', 'backbone', 'film', 'film', 'suffers', 'tremendously', 'enough', 'cost', 'two', 'stars.So', 'fact', 'think', 'Van', 'Sant', 'crew', 'got', 'overall', 'feel', 'right', 'were', 'correct', 'not', 'let', 'get', 'too', 'deep', 'explanations', 'character', 'study', 'film', 'ultimately', 'clumsy', 'dialogue.If', 'want', 'explanation', 'school', 'shooting', 'go', 'see', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'amongst', 'others', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'day', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'shooting', 'probably', 'actuality', 'see', 'elephant', 'Just', 'keep', 'mind', 'actual', 'high', 'schoolers', 'actual', 'high', 'schools', 'produce', 'better', 'dialogue', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'concoct']",Elephant

In the wake of Columbine and other high school shootings, today's kids live in an atmosphere of fear, and sudden death spares no one, not even the most beautiful and stylish.  I guess high school has always been about fear (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER had it right), but add guns to the mixture and you have a situation in which the bullied can finally strike back.  Va Sant takes a measured approach to this quasi-revolutionary thesis, doubling back again and again from a crucial hallway confrontation (between Eli and John, as Eli takes what might be the very last photo ever taken of the lad) as if to prohibit us from deciding that aha, that's why they did it!So that we keep seeing this apparently simple scene more than once, not on a rote basis either, but the film returns to it at unexpected cadenzas, never when you might guess it was happening.  Similarly the characters are ""introduced"" (by their names, in the sort of intertitles you'd see in silent films) at different lengths of time following their visual introductions.  There's a free jazz timing behind each production decision, and it's pretty exhilarating.  Yes, there are some horrid, cliched scenes in the script.  The three girls all throwing up at the same time seem to have stepped out of a satire like MEAN GIRLS; but up until that moment their interchange, and the agonistic byplay among the three, as one tries to break free of a slavish friendship, had been nearly lifelike and never boring (an extensive De Palma esque continuous moving shot sees them warily circling the cafeteria like hummingbirds).Van Sant begins the movie with a painful sequence in which John makes his  dad pull over, too drunk to drive, and take the wheel himself, and he casts the redoubtable US actor Joseph Bottoms to play the part of the dad, thus clearly signalling a tip of the hat to the 1970s ""New American Cinema"" in which Bottoms had played such a crucial part (THE LAST PICTURE SHOW; JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN; LOVE AND PAIN AND THE WHOLE DAMN THING).

Suggestive shots include a janitor mopping behind one walker, erasing his footsteps. Another shows boys playing a violent video game after one becomes frustrated practicing piano.

We follow long shots of students going through their day, developing film, eating in the cafeteria, etc.  There is a real mix of actors who make it seem very life-like.  However, we need to wade through a lot to get to the promised bang at the end.  The absence of an explanation for what motivates Alex to plan this is perhaps the only way it could be handled.  We see Alex lives in a house where his parents are like absentee landlords.  There appears to be little supervision or interaction.  Moreover, there does not seem to be much love.  When Alex, played by Alex Frost in his only film role I could find, showers with his friend Eric played by Eric Deulen, it seems like maybe at least the boys have found someone to whom they could relate.  However, Alex proves to be a master manipulator.  The scene at the end where his buddy shows up to report on all his kills and receives a bullet to the chest is chilling.  However, this school is strange.  There are empty halls.  Shots ring out and the instructor appears oblivious until he drags a dead student back into the room smearing a blood trail behind him.  I know that this subject is a difficult one.  Nevertheless, I found the film to lack sensitivity and certainly it lacked heroes.  Diane Keaton produced this Gus Van Sant-directed film.

I agree that the young black man walking nonchalantly walking through the halls as he walks past dead bodies, hears the sounds of gunshots and sees kids running for their lives out of the schools and then he sees one of the shooters, nonchalantly walks up to him and is instantly shot, instead of leaving the school to save his own life or walking up to the shooter and trying to talk the shooter into putting down his weapon is stupid and preposterous. It makes no sense at all and I still can't figure out why they put that character in there. No one would do something like that unless they were completely insane.

So much film is wasted following students around walking from class to class or just walking off a field, the first half seems like a high school student's film project.  There are short stories for a few of the students, and all the film stars are non-professional, just everyday kids.  There is no story, and ""Elephant"" must refer to the saying ""The Elephant in the Room"" -  The long filming of walking and retaking a scene from another perspective tries to give the viewer a feel that they are in an ordinary high school, unaware of the anger of a student who feels ""bullied"".  This student is shown in Chemistry or a Physics class at the back of the room with other students throwing spitballs at him.  He is different, a classical pianist of great talent, but angry,  ordering guns from a mail order firm and practicing his aim in the garage woodpile.  He and his brother watch old World War II documentaries on Hitler and his thugs.Towards the last part of the movie, ""Elephant"" shows them walking together into the high school with full hunting gear.  Then like the Columbine slaughters, they kill fellow students and teachers for no real reason.

It wasn't simply timing that won the film the Palme d'Or when it premiered at Cannes, this movie is legitimately a masterpiece, and a film that says a great deal without very much dialogue.The film follows around a cast of around 12 characters throughout its 80 minute running time, using slow tracking shots and sparse dialogue to force its audience to feel the mounting tension. While the film initially feels to be about nothing in particular other than a few high school kids walking around and taking pictures, we see from early on that something much more sinister is taking place.It's obvious at this point that this film is not simply a metaphor for the Columbine school shooting, but heavily based on it. However, it's not made to exploit the horror of that day in Colorado, but merely to try to understand why things like this happen, and to observe the unsuspecting victims and how they react in a time of total brutality. This film does what so many films fail to do without the urgency of a conventional action film. It is because Gus Van Sant gives us so much time to breathe that the film seems so important.

802233,A1D2AXVN20OQZD,B0001EFUFK,Marc A. Coignard,"[3, 7]","I am not, for a second, going to question why Gus Van Sant made this film.  It was only a matter of time before an artist--be it film maker, author, playwrite, etc--did a piece depicting Columbine or some similar shooting at a school, and rightly so, I say.  It was a tragedy that shook the entire nation, not just here in the Littleton and Denver areas.  I was not a Columbine student, so I will not comment as a victim of sorts.  I live, work, and am often near the Columbine/Bear Creek/Ken Caryl area in Littleton, and I have known some survivors, but that is as close as I have been to this tragedy.  My views are not to be confused with those of someone who was actually there.Gus Van Sant, the film's writer and director, takes us inside an un-named high school in what can only be considered middle-class-middle America.  It begins slowly, taking us through the opening day of many of the school's students; from the popular to the picked-on to the average, the men, the women, the students, the faculty and even a parent.  As the day progresses, it becomes apparent to the viewer, despite the cut-up style of scene editing and clipping, that a shooting similar to what happened at Columbine High School in 1999 is about to occur.That's the film in a nut-shell.  My problems are not with subject matter, however.  As I said, it was only a matter of time before someone tackled the subject head-on, and I have to say it is better than a more down-to-earth director not as interested in profit like Gus Van Sant made this, and not some Hollywood name who was hired on.  No, my problems are about the existing film itself.First off, the carnage in the school.  No, I'm not saying it is in any way necessary for any of it to be edited or dummed down so as not to offend people IF--and this is a biggie--IF it adds something to the film, either in statement or in effect.  Now, the scenes certainly are unsettling--they actually left me shaking.  So in that respect, mission accomplished.  But I have to ask why it happened the way it did?  At Columbine, many were wounded and a total of 13 people killed, including the gunmen.  In this story, it seems the gunmen (or boys, as it were) were succesful in taking out almost every single target.  These were/are two amateurs who had never shot anyone in real life, yet were dead-on (no pun intended) in every shot they fired.  I think part of the reason so many people DIDN'T die at Columbine and similar school shootings were because the gunboys really had no clue what they were doing.  If realism was what Gus was after, a lower body count would have done it.Also, why were some characters introduced at all?  Benny jumps to mind, as he was shown for only one scene, had no dialogue, and was almost immediately killed.  And while on the subject of characters, what happened to the photographer for instance?  Why was the father drunk so early in the morning?  Why, before the shooting, did the two gunboys make out in the shower?  Did any of that really add anything to the conflict (if there really was any) to the story?  Not at all, really.  Without finding out why certain things are done, we're just watching half a story.  A violent ending just isn't enough for me to be interested.Thirdly, and this is the big question, why did it happen?  I've seen plenty of news reports, heard eye-witness accounts, read articles, heard discussions, and on and on and on it goes, and the only thing this film did that all that didn't was show blood.  Once again, I'm not opposed to the showing of said violence, but if it is going to show up on film, I want to know why!  And just showing a kid getting spit-balls thrown at him by some A-hole jocks ain't enough to justify a rampage like this, either in real life or in the movies.  Plenty of kids are picked on in High School every day all across the nation, and probably all across the world.  Hell, I was one of them who was picked on!  So no one can say to me that being picked on is a reason why two kids decide to kill everyone in their sites--at most all I ever wanted to do was throw a punch at one or two people.  So again, the question is why?  If this subject is going to be explored, don't just throw in some gore and dead kids and expect the world to think a statement is being made.  To me, this movie had no purpose but to shock and appal.  It does nothing to try and explain, fix, or shed light on the problems at hand, nor does it really explore the minds of these two goons, or the real life weak-little boys they're modeled after.And finally, closure.  So, we can guess the jock and his girl got it in the freezer.  But what then?  How did this effect the community, or more importantly the individual students?  Like I said, I've spoken to and heard survivors talk about what happened, but not everyone in the country has.  So why make this movie if in the end we're left asking the same question?  WHY?! Why did these two kids kill all those innocent people, and why did Gus Van Sant make such a stupid movie!",2,...but why?,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,5025,"['am', 'not', 'second', 'going',

The characters were boring as well.The description on the back of the DVD case was obnoxious enough for me to steer clear entirely. I remember reading it a couple times and asking why on earth I was about to watch this. Firstly, it starts off very slow. And the middle is slow, too. The ending is the only decent part of the film, but it's still screwed up just by the overall way it was presented, edited and shot. Halfway through this movie I was so ready to get up and leave.When one scene arose with the three girls talking (about boys and their weight) I whispered to my girlfriend watching with me ""Which one do you think is the anorexic? She thought that comment was funny because she expected that as well. but, of course, a scene following up was all three of the girls entering a bathroom and all throwing up together. It was overall just silly to me.One scene that sticks in my mind was the lunchroom scene with the kid writing in his notebook. A girl walks up to him and asks him ""WHAT ARE YOU WRITING"" and he answers ""SOMETHING BIG. YOU'LL SEE"" (or something similar) And then the girl walks away, never to be seen again. That character was added to the story specifically to let the audience know that the kid was planning something. It's amateurish scriptwriting at best.Why is it that every character had such monotone personalities. Most of which were one dimensional to begin with. Seems like the majority of the film was just to show how many students with crappy lives can be summed up into a single day. When it boils down to it, it's blatantly preachy in some sense. Perhaps it's about video games create killers? Was columbine a reference? The shooting was also predicted by my girlfriend, but I doubted it would end with a shooting because I thought it would be too obvious of an ending.Maybe I would have had a better grasp on the film if my girlfriend wasn't screaming at the screen half the time. But, I think this movie has little going for itself. I did like the use of the Elephant, it made me giggle a bit.If you do plan on seeing this movie, I'd rent it from the library.",1,"What's up, Gus?",1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,2320,"['only', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'gus', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'may', 'be', 'last.This', 'movie', 'consisted', 'predictable', 'lousily', 'conducted', 'ideas', 'multiple', 'shots', 'lasted', 'much', 'much', 'longer', 'needed', 'characters', 'were', 'boring', 'well.The', 'description', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'obnoxious', 'enough', 'steer', 'clear', 'entirely', 'remember', 'reading', 'couple', 'times', 'asking', 'why', 'earth', 'was', 'about', 'watch', 'Firstly', 'off', 'very', 'slow', 'middle', 'slow', 'too', 'ending', 'only', 'decent', 'part', 'film', 'still', 'screwed', 'up', 'just', 'overall', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'edited', 'shot', 'Halfway', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'ready', 'get', 'up', 'leave.When', 'one', 'scene', 'arose', 'three', 'girls', 'talking', 'boys', 'weight', 'whispered', 'girlfriend', 'watching', 'Which', 'one', 'do', 'think', 'anorexic', 'thought', 'comment', 'was', 'funny', 'expected', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'scene', 'following', 'up', 'was', 'three', 'girls', 'entering', 'bathroom', 'throwing', 'up', 'together', 'was', 'overall', 'just', 'silly', 'me.One', 'scene', 'mind', 'was', 'lunchroom', 'scene', 'kid', 'writing', 'notebook', 'girl', 'up', 'WHAT', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'WRITING', 'SOMETHING', 'BIG', 'SEE', 'something', 'similar', 'then', 'girl', 'away', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'character', 'was', 'added', 'story', 'specifically', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'kid', 'was', 'planning', 'something', 'amateurish', 'scriptwriting', 'best.Why', 'character', 'had', 'such', 'monotone', 'personalities', 'Most', 'were', 'one', 'dimensional', 'begin', 'Seems', 'majority', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'many', 'students', 'crappy', 'lives', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'single', 'day', 'When', 'down', 'blatantly', 'preachy', 'sense', 'Perhaps', 'video', 'games', 'create', 'killers', 'Was', 'columbine', 'reference', 'shooting', 'was', 'also', 'predicted', 'girlfriend', 'doubted', 'would', 'end', 'shooting', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'obvious', 'ending.Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'grasp', 'film', 'girlfriend', 'was', ""n't"", 'screaming', 'screen', 'time', 'think', 'movie', 'little', 'going', 'did', 'use', 'Elephant', 'made', 'giggle', 'bit.If', 'do', 'plan', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'d"", 'rent', 'library']",Elephant

There are the jocks, the cheerleaders, the bookworms, the slackers, and the everyday kids.  Van Sant has a clever technique where he is able to follow (stalk) each student as they walk down the hallways and pass from one to another as they go through their daytime routine.  We also see the killers in preparation for the possible murders to follow.  Everything is paced in a real time mode with no hurrying or jumpy editing.  The viewer becomes an observer and a participant, watching normal activities slowly unfold to an almost ordinary conclusion - except that it is not.

802238,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B0001EFUFK,M. Burns,"[8, 10]","In under ninety minues, a fluid, objective camera plunges into a normal Oregon high school on the brink of a violent ""Columbine-style"" shooting. We meet a number of students and hear their conversations, learn bits about their lives, see who goes to the bathroom to vomit up their lunch, find out what that shy girl in gym class is going through - and meet the shooters as they prepare and finally (pardon the expression) execute their plan.Elephant is by no means plot-driven - shots meander from behind students through hallways for minutes at a time. It also makes no attempts to prech or editorialize about the atrocity of school violence. Elephant is simply 'there,' as attentive during little moments of seemingly no consequence as it is during the graphic altercation that closes the film. I admired the strength and flow of Van Sant's film, but Elephant stands as a movie that can be admired but never really enjoyed. This is a bold, brave film, but also a very challenging one that offers no solutions but plenty of things to keep you awake at night. Something about Elephant really impacted me, though, and that was Van Sant's choice to not try and tie things up in any way - neatly or in a messy fashion. I believe that is because there is no easy solution or explanation for this school violence, and Elephant preys on our deepest fears that it can simply happen without much pretense. The film would have been less effective had the somewhat-improvised dialogue and performances of the teens been less real - every word coming from every mouth, and every gesture is organic. With such identifiable characters, the school shooting takes on a disturbing, morbid air with Van Sant's brilliant choice - it's not sensationalized one bit. The multiple murders have the same pace as the languid tracking of the first part of the film, and that is where it is obvious that Van Sant truly has something to say. It may take a while for it to become obvious, but with some patience and thought, Elephant can emerge as the most thoughtful exploration of random school violence yet produced. Aside from Andrew Jarecki's terrifying documentary, Capturing the Friedmans, Van Sant's Elephant could just be the most bizarre and thought-provoking cinematic experience of the year.

The only music we hear -- an amateurish rendering of Beethoven -- is played on an out-of-tune piano by one of the young killers.The cinematography is stunning and the narrative architecture ingenious.  The story unfolds in a Faulknerian manner by identifying and following a number of high school students one at a time.  Long tracking shots, slow pans, and minimal dialogue imbue the film with a real-time flavor.  Use of extremely shallow focus renders the point-of-view of each student both intimate and personal.  They seem unrelated at first, but these individual narrative threads begin to interweave, becoming one fabric in the eerily low-key finale.  The movie builds inexorably to one end but, through its methodology, underscores the random perversity of tragedy, and paths crossing at the wrong place and time.Throughout its 81 minutes, the film makes no moral judgments, offers little sentiment and, most important, comes to no gratuitous conclusions.  It is simply a hyper-realistic depiction of a day in the life of an ordinary high school which ends most extraordinarily.There is only one professional actor in the film.  Timothy Bottoms, who had demons of his own as a teenager in 'The Last Picture Show' 40 years ago, plays an ineffectual father.  Mr. Van Sant recruited all the actors from the Portland high school where he filmed, and draws the most amazing natural performances from these startlingly beautiful young people. Using the simplest of elements, this distinguished artist has produced perhaps the greatest allegory of our time.",5,filmmaking perfection,1092528000,"08 15, 2004",2004,2087,"['Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'once', 'again', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'artist', 'unique', 'vision', 'perfect', 'understated', 'little', 'film', 'remarkable', 'striking', 'level', ""'Elephant"", 'inspired', 'rendering', 'shootings', 'Columbine', 'standard', 'disclaimer', 'resemblance', 'people', 'living', 'dead', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Sant', 'developed', 'unique', 'approach', 'compelling', 'issue', 'normal', 'cinematic', 'artifices', 'soundtrack', 'ambient', 'sounds', 'nature', 'usual', 'cacophony', 'high', 'school', 'only', 'music', 'hear', 'amateurish', 'rendering', 'Beethoven', 'played', 'out-of-tune', 'piano', 'one', 'young', 'killers.The', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'narrative', 'architecture', 'ingenious', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Faulknerian', 'manner', 'identifying', 'following', 'number', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'one', 'time', 'Long', 'tracking', 'shots', 'slow', 'pans', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'film', 'real-time', 'flavor', 'Use', 'extremely', 'shallow', 'focus', 'point-of-view', 'student', 'intimate', 'personal', 'seem', 'unrelated', 'first', 'individual', 'narrative', 'threads', 'begin', 'interweave', 'becoming', 'one', 'fabric', 'eerily', 'low-key', 'finale', 'movie', 'inexorably', 'one', 'end', 'methodology', 'random', 'perversity', 'tragedy', 'paths', 'crossing', 'wrong', 'place', 'time.Throughout', '81', 'minutes', 'film', 'moral', 'judgments', 'little', 'sentiment', 'most', 'important', 'gratuitous', 'conclusions', 'simply', 'hyper-realistic', 'depiction', 'day', 'life', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'most', 'only', 'one', 'professional', 'actor', 'film', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'who', 'had', 'demons', 'own', 'teenager', ""'The"", 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'ineffectual', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Sant', 'recruited', 'actors', 'Portland', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'filmed', 'most', 'amazing', 'natural', 'performances', 'startlingly', 'beautiful', 'young', 'people', 'Using', 'simplest', 'elements', 'distinguished', 'artist', 'produced', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'allegory', 'time']",Elephant

Set in a high school and inspired by the Columbine shootings of 1999, ""Elephant"" depicts pieces of a day in the life of several high school students leading up to the penultimate event of the shootings.The structure of the film is, to say the least, loose: Van Sant jumps forward and back in time so we see the same event from a number of different angles. And it is not until we see a couple of the students armed that we realize that something bad, very bad is going to happen. Van Sant's mise en scene is scattered, brightly light, all formica and vinyl tile and huge dirty windows...lots of windows.Van Sant builds up a dreadful amount of suspense merely by the piling on of mundane scenes that get more frenzied and out of control by the minute. You know what is going to happen and god help you; you can't wait for it to start just to relieve the tension.""Elephant"" (thusly named because of the psychologically induced big animal sitting in the midst of the high school that no one can nor wants to see) shows us what we don't want to see.

802242,A35K06H07L5POJ,B0001EFUFK,"Miss Gigi ""Detroit Weekly Chronicle""","[2, 5]","""Elephant"" is perhaps the most intensely realistic and true-to-life account of the typical American high school, to date. Basically, the film has little central plot other than following the lives of two young outcasts-turned-massacrers.The overwhelming truth of what social ridicule and rejection does to a person--especially in a high school setting--is put, through Van Sant's camera, very boldly, but with an emotional detachment to any of the characters.Audience becomes one with students, and come to view the behavior of modern teens as an image that simply IS, and not somthing we are meant to feel or understand. Inspired by the Columbine tragedy, the ""story,"" (if there is one) follows several students through thier day-to-day ho-hum lives at a generalized high school.Several stomach-turning subjects are addressed (I won't give away the double-entente there), but are unavoidably a truth that Van Sant passionately films with a lethargy that's not rare with documentaries today.The direction on Van Sant's part is precise, with music that emphasizes the ""THE-TRUTH-IS-OUT-THERE"" theme, most significantly with Beetholven's 'Moonlight Sonata,' and the acting is as real as it gets for non-actors.Consider the fact that ""Elephant"" was filmed within a few months, at an actual (and functioning) high school, with actual acting-inept students, and on an almost entirely improvisational script. With this, one can see how 'real' ""Elephant"" honestly is.For those who tire easily, you may fall asleep and miss the gut-wrenching finale (think Columbine, people), but on the whole, this film is a blast, uh, literally.The only part worth picketing is the scene concerning Eric and Alex's kiss in the shower.Van Sant's implication is not that the two were gay, but that they knew of thier upcoming suicide and hadn't ever kissed anyone prior (Yes, even I was confused.)I give the film five stars cheifly due to it's genuine thematic elements, breathtaking camerawork, and uncompromised depiction of the high school as it should be.Loved it, watched it again, and again, but didn't buy it,--GIGI",5,Another Classic via Van Sant!!!,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2097,"['Elephant', 'perhaps', 'most', 'intensely', 'realistic', 'true-to-life', 'account', 'typical', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'date', 'Basically', 'film', 'little', 'central', 'plot', 'other', 'following', 'lives', 'two', 'young', 'outcasts-turned-massacrers.The', 'overwhelming', 'truth', 'what', 'social', 'ridicule', 'rejection', 'person', 'especially', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'put', 'Van', 'Sant', 'camera', 'very', 'boldly', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'characters.Audience', 'one', 'students', 'come', 'view', 'behavior', 'modern', 'teens', 'image', 'simply', 'IS', 'not', 'somthing', 'are', 'meant', 'feel', 'understand', 'Inspired', 'Columbine', 'tragedy', 'story', 'one', 'several', 'students', 'thier', 'day-to-day', 'ho-hum', 'lives', 'generalized', 'high', 'school.Several', 'stomach-turning', 'subjects', 'are', 'addressed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'double-entente', 'there', 'are', 'unavoidably', 'truth', 'Van', 'Sant', 'passionately', 'lethargy', 'not', 'rare', 'documentaries', 'today.The', 'direction', 'Van', 'Sant', 'part', 'precise', 'music', 'THE-TRUTH-IS-OUT-THERE', 'theme', 'most', 'significantly', 'Beetholven', ""'Moonlight"", 'Sonata', 'acting', 'as', 'real', 'non-actors.Consider', 'fact', 'Elephant', 'was', 'filmed', 'few', 'months', 'actual', 'functioning', 'high', 'school', 'actual', 'acting-inept', 'students', 'almost', 'entirely', 'improvisational', 'script', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', ""'real"", 'Elephant', 'honestly', 'is.For', 'who', 'tire', 'easily', 'may', 'fall', 'asleep', 'miss', 'gut-wrenching', 'finale', 'think', 'Columbine', 'people', 'whole', 'film', 'blast', 'uh', 'only', 'part', 'picketing', 'scene', 'concerning', 'Eric', 'Alex', 'kiss', 'shower.Van', 'Sant', 'implication', 'not', 'two', 'were', 'gay', 'knew', 'thier', 'upcoming', 'suicide', 'had', ""n't"", 'ever', 'kissed', 'anyone', 'prior', 'Yes', 'even', 'was', 'confused', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'cheifly', 'due', 'genuine', 'thematic', 'elements', 'breathtaking', 'camerawork', 'uncompromised', 'depiction', 'high', 'school', 'should', 'be.Loved', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'GIGI']",Elephant

802245,A1BPCSTNJDIL69,B0001EFUFK,"Mono-Grind ""dtb""","[2, 2]","I've wanted to see this film ever since it first came out around 2003/2004. Finally, i've seen the movie and i understand why so many people are so divided about it. I feel it's very much an aquired taste, the sort of film that goes over some people's heads because either they had higher expectations or just weren't able to get into it for whatever reason. I sat down and watched this movie expecting it to be really bad, i told myself this, and when the movie ended i just thought..What an amazing film. It's definitely a movie that makes you think, but it also makes you feel empty and that's what i think Gus Van Sant was trying to convey.The movie can be described as ""artsy"", or ""trying too hard"" in some ways, and i really do understand why people feel that way. There's definitely parts in the film that do drag on a little bit longer than usual. But that's what it is, it's supposed to be real, everyday life and i think Gus Van Sant has done a great job at capturing that image.Another thing about this film is that i notice some reviewers are comparing this to the Columbine Massacre of April 1999. The thing is, it's only based on those events and the events of other school shootings too. It simply tries to give an insight into how shocking the reality of an unexpected school shooting is like. And it also gives an insight into everyday school life, how teenagers interact and how the many cliques (Jocks, Nerds, Goths..) interact with eachother as well. What eventually happens is a school shooting, and the fact everyone watching this knows this is going to happen just adds to the tension. The way this film follows one character through the whole day, up until the shooting, then cuts and follows the next character the same way, is just brilliant in my opinion.As i said, there's alot of tension through-out. And even the shots from behind of the characters walking around the school grounds..which go for a fair few minutes most of the time..has you wondering every step of the way how things will happen. How the characters will somehow link together in the end. And when the shooting is actually taking place, the acting is quite good and 'real' in a sense. Although a downside of this film is that everyone is mostly an 'unkown', which leads to the acting being poor in a few scenes, i really think the cast did a great job.The Extras on this DVD are the ""Theatrical Trailer"", which i suggest you watch before watching the actual movie..but either way is fine, ""Gus Van Sant's Filmography"", which just details the films Gus Van Sant has directed in his career (Good Will Hunting, To Die For, My Own Private Idaho, Finding Forrester..etc), and also ""On The Set of Elephant: Rolling Through Time"" (Which i haven't watched yet).All in all..this is a highly recommended film to everyone that likes movies that makes them think, and are willing to sit through some of these extended scenes that seem to stretch on a bit too long but in reality just keep the tension building.

Gus Van Sant does a great job with this films direction at times and really does a good job of setting the mood.  My wife felt the movie moved too slow but i thought it was well paced.  He did a great job of capturing lesser known facts about high school kids and suceeded on many levels of pegging certian kids and clicks.Now for the bad.  The acting was awful and i mean terrible.  I would be shocked if we ever heard from any of these pretty faces again because that is ALL they had to offer.  The dialogie was great but so poorly delivered that you would think you were watching a high school play rather than a movie.  Also, the actors they got to play the roles of high school students were very inconsistant at best.  SOme of the actors looked like they were pushings mid 30's while others were more believable.  One thing i fould out of place were the large number of homosexuals in this movie.  For a movie that is suposed to be filmed in any highschool in America i was shocked at the numbers of gay actors in this film.  Well, either there was an unrealistic number of gay charecters or too many poor gay actors used in this movie (probably the later judging by the performances).  I was also very let down by the ending, the film has a snowballing suspense to it and then it melts.  If youve seen this movie then you know what im saying if you havent prepared to be let down at the end.Final thoughts-  I wanted to like this movie and i did at times but as an overall film i think its fails as much as it suceeds.

I've read the other reviews mostly the reviewers didn't get the point & pass it off as pointless. Van Sant was making a truly brilliant point. The way he filmed it in first person filming was very clever. Because it drives the point of taking you into a day in the lives of ordinary kids in a suburban high school. It illustrates how mundane life can be. The reason you don't get to really know the characters was to illustrate the randomness of the killings. How many people do you really get to know in high school you have your select group of friends & thats it. These two kids weren't worshiping some evil force or chanting satanic rituals they were normal two kids who  felt ignored to the world. Thats the truly scary thing about this movie is the explanation of why. What drove them to this point?  As for the scene of them kissing each other was not necessarily  to insinuate homosexuality. I feel the writer was illustrating the point of the relatability of the two on a sick idea. The film has a great build up aspect to it you can literally feel the discontent in Eric (one of the shooters).

I didn't say it had a horrible storyline or unbelievably bad plot, it has NO storyline at all, I'm not exaggerating.This movie is like watching 71 minutes of security cam footage from a bank, where the last 10 minutes shows a bank robbery. For 71 minutes, you watched customer after customer do their business with the bank teller, then finally in the end you watch the robbery take place.Another example, let's say you took a camcorder to school or work with you, and you decide to just start filming little random things that happen throughout the day, after gathering 81 minutes worth of film filled with your co-workers, break room, bathroom, etc., do you think this footage you gathered is worthy to be released as a MOTION PICTURE? Are you kidding me? Who the hell would want to see such pointless footage other than you or the people you filmed?This very forgettable movie Elephant bores you to death with the first 70 minutes or so showing random people doing random things in a random high school, and you never care for any of them. It features such pointless actions such as: watching a kid walk down a hall for 5 minutes as he passes other people, watching girls eat lunch and talk about 100% irrelevant things, and you get to watch guys throw a football around for 5 minutes. None of this is connected in any way to a storyline, and to make it worse, these actions go on far too long, that's what takes up the bulk of the movie. It also has some very unrealistic acting near the end when the actual school shooting takes place (just look at people's reactions), but I won't harp on that, since I only expect good acting from actual movies.Obviously I can see they're trying to depict how an average ordinary day at an ordinary high school with ordinary students can be affected by an extraordinary event, tragically affecting the innocent lives of everyone there. The problem with this type of storytelling is it makes it incredibly boring, and 0% entertaining. It doesn't matter if I'm watching this in 2005, or in 1999 when Columbine took place, it doesn't change the fact that this movie is a 100% piece of namesake crap.

802251,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0001EFUFK,Nicholas Carroll,"[5, 11]","Let's get real here. In the closing credits, there is a line that says ""any resemblance to actual people and events is purely coincidental"". Coincidental? The entire movie is a fictional version of the Columbine High School massacre...right down to the shootings in the cafeteria and library; two malcontents obsessed with guns and Hitler, one of them even named Eric, who was one of the killers at Columbine. So, who is Gus Van Sant trying to kid? The parallels are obvious.While I admire anyone willing to tackle the events behind Columbine, I think this film was far too artsy/independent for the subject matter at hand. An amazon reviewer explained the point of featuring the mundane in contrast to the shocking violence, but I don't think it worked, at least not for me. Seeing students walking with their backs to the camera and one of the boys playing the piano for over 5 minutes...those scenes made it boring to watch. True, its a mundane detail in life that we don't see in films, which is why we don't. The story is more important than showing the unnecessary details of life. It is that reason why I subtract several stars.What I like about the film were the acting by unknowns and the way the film flowed (how we would follow one student through his/her routine then the film would pick up on another, then another, each time taking us back earlier in the day). It was unique and not too difficult to follow. For me, the most disturbing aspect of the film are the three girls in the cafeteria, how one of them demands from the others that they hang out with her and shop after school. It was so real and what I remember about high school...how controlling some people are in their friendships. That conversation perfectly illustrated the superficiality of the high school environment.However, when the most interesting thing about the movie is the documentary on Hitler that is shown for several minutes, that's an indication of how ultimately boring I found this film. I wanted to see the documentary in its entirity rather than watch this drivel. I expected better of Gus Van Sant. But to his credit, I was alarmed when the shooting started happening, because after showing us the mundane routine of several students, the shooting does jar me out of my coma. That might have been his point, and for that reason, it is a brilliant move. However, because I think a film about what happened at Columbine could have and should have been more carefully constructed, I expected more than he was able to deliver. It's hard to recommend this film and one I'd never watch again. I also doubt that anyone who has ever lived through a school shooting would ever want to watch this film. It is disturbing, to say the least.

The box from the rental place says 'What began as an ordinary day in the lives of ordinary teenagers became a day no one would ever forget.' And that's exactly what it was. Ordinary. It was an ordinary day for an hour. Kids walked around their school. Except it wasn't ordinary. Not one of the characters seemed real at all. They all floated in a strange place between reality and stereotype, as if they knew they were in a movie, so they were scared of being realistic, but they knew it was supposed to be realistic, so they were scared of being too stereotypical. It tried so hard to impress upon you the idea of normality, but, in the end, all it did was lose the audience's interest before it even had it. It just seemed to self serious for anyone else to possibly take it seriously. It wants desperately to be some great piece of art, and it's finally convinced itself that it is, and now it's just hanging on the wall for the clueless masses to fawn over, never thinking that maybe formlessness doesn't automatically assume greatness.

802253,A1129LM24YWSZV,B0001EFUFK,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[1, 3]","This movie won big at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, and I'm still trying to figure out why. The movie chronicles two days in the life of a several high school students, two of whom are plotting a school killing spree. The name of the movie comes from the old story of several blind men touching and describing different parts of an elephant. (Each man is firmly convinced that he alone realizes what type of animal he is confronting. In truth, none of the men are aware, because they do not see the entire picture of the elephant.)The film is shot in long shots, which follow the various students as they go about their daily activities. While many of their paths cross (you see some of the characters walking by in the background while the camera focuses on whoever you're following at that moment), they don't interact very much.For the most part, I found this film unrewarding. First of all, I thought that the characters were dealt with very superficially. Van Sant doesn't let us get too close to any of them, and as a result I didn't care too much about any of them. Secondly, the majority of the movie just follows kids as they walk through high school halls, check out books, and eat lunch in the cafeteria. I think that a minimum of this action might have been necessary to set the scene and re-introduce us to high school life, but these shots made up the bulk of the movie. I know that some argue that this is the point of the film, that great tragedy arises out of the minutiae of everyday life, that horrible events are unpredictable and difficult to trace to any sort of triggering moment. However, I'm not so sure that such trivia makes for a compelling film. (And who wants to go back to high school? Not this viewer.)Lastly, I felt that the erotic scene between the two shooters was gratuitous. It just felt thrown in and strained, and nothing I'd seen previously seemed to make it necessary or even meaningful.On the whole, I thought the film was not very provocative, even though it dealt with a topic that could have been mined for some cathartic discussion and thought. The film seemed totally disconnected from any of the events that occured. Van Sant seemed to have no direction, no reason for making this film. He just gives us a fly-on-the-wall perspective of a school shooting that is detatched and emotionless. I really didn't think that was the best treatment for this subject matter.So, I guess, for me, the elephant in the room is why on earth this film earned such acclaim.

If your're looking for a John Hughes film then dont bother. You really have to be in the right frame of mind to watch something like this & appreciate it. I loved the way Gus van Sant followed the characters around with a steadicam in a very mundane way. I was expecting this style to change once the violence began but it doesnt, instead Gus breaks typical hollywood tradition & films the acts of violence in the exact same mundane way which makes the violence even more horrific because the killers are so emotionally removed from what they're doing.

We see overlong shots of people walking through hallways, engaged in small talk...for EXCRUTIATINGLY long periods of time.  No matter how you rationalize this, whatever meaning or message you want to assign these shots (75% of the movie at least), it is extraordinarily boring.  I got so sick of watching the back of a guy's head as he walked through a hallway for a solid minute I began fast-forwarding through some of the scenes.2) Acting and Directing.  Eventually (and mercifully for the viewer), Gus Van Sant finally introduces the school shootings near the end of the film.  The student and faculty reactions are unauthentic.  The actors lazily prance away.  When I was in school, the kids scrambled faster to watch a fistfight, much less if two psychopaths opened fire in the building.3)  Style.  The movie is all style, a little content and message, no acting, and no dialogue.  You get the impression after ten minutes of viewing that Van Sant started out making a film loosely based on Columbine and got distracted playing around with his damn camera.I understand the point of the film...its a normal day...here's a little bit into the life of some of the kids at the schol...here's a little bit about the kids who did it.  Not going to explain why it happened....etc.  Thats fine.  But the end result is a boring, dull film.

802257,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B0001EFUFK,Paulo Leite,"[5, 5]","As everybody knows, this film was inspired by the Columbine High School Massacre that took place in Columbine, Colorado, 1999.The film does not have a classic plot. It simply follows the last minutes of a group of high school kids before two of them enter the school ""armed to the teeth"" and start shooting anything that moves. Some of them get killed. Some will survive.Simple as that.But the film is more than JUST that.FIRST, it is a very inventive narrative exercise as we follow several characters' point of view whose path crosses other characters' paths we previously have seen. At one time, you'll get the idea the screenplay is constructing a big puzzle that will only be complete when the shooting begins - which it does.SECOND, I found those characters fascinating. Even without a plot, Gus Van Sant is able to touch us with the unique experience of some characters. The first five minutes or so, when John (played by the beautiful John Robinson), a kid whose father seems to be an alcoholic, cries without knowing why is very eloquent and clear about the unseen inside of those characters.THIRD, there is an ambiance of... it's hard to describe... loneliness, isolation, inner disorder... that we only find in the best horror/thriller films. And strangely enough we find it here, in a film like this (not horror nor a thriller). In fact, I believe anyone interested such genres, should take a look at this film and be amazed.FOURTH: the film really gets your attention in the end, when the whole thing happens... randomly, unexpectedly...In retrospect, I think this is one the most important works of the decade and, in a certain way, it says a lot about today's youth in America: beautiful when it's beautiful and really monstrous when it goes downhill.As a non-American (I'm in Europe), two scenes stuck me like lightning (for obvious reasons): the one when the three girls go vomit after lunch (I wasn't expecting that one! - laughs) and the one where two boys order a fire weapon by mail and get their kicks from shooting chopped wood in a garage.That scene alone should make America rethink its attitude about guns... or some day such attitude might rethink America.",5,A Triumph in Modern Cinema and an Ode to American Youth.,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,2183,"['everybody', 'film', 'was', 'inspired', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'Massacre', 'took', 'place', 'Columbine', 'Colorado', '1999.The', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'classic', 'plot', 'simply', 'last', 'minutes', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'two', 'enter', 'school', 'armed', 'teeth', 'start', 'shooting', 'anything', 'get', 'killed', 'will', 'survive.Simple', 'that.But', 'film', 'more', 'JUST', 'that.FIRST', 'very', 'inventive', 'narrative', 'exercise', 'follow', 'several', 'characters', 'point', 'view', 'path', 'other', 'characters', 'paths', 'previously', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'time', ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'screenplay', 'constructing', 'big', 'puzzle', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'complete', 'when', 'shooting', 'found', 'characters', 'fascinating', 'Even', 'plot', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'able', 'touch', 'unique', 'experience', 'characters', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'when', 'John', 'played', 'beautiful', 'John', 'Robinson', 'kid', 'father', 'be', 'alcoholic', 'cries', 'knowing', 'why', 'very', 'eloquent', 'clear', 'unseen', 'inside', 'characters.THIRD', 'ambiance', 'hard', 'describe', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'inner', 'disorder', 'only', 'find', 'best', 'horror/thriller', 'films', 'strangely', 'find', 'here', 'film', 'not', 'horror', 'thriller', 'fact', 'believe', 'anyone', 'interested', 'such', 'genres', 'should', 'take', 'look', 'film', 'be', 'amazed.FOURTH', 'film', 'really', 'attention', 'end', 'when', 'whole', 'thing', 'happens', 'randomly', 'unexpectedly', 'retrospect', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'works', 'decade', 'certain', 'way', 'lot', 'today', 'youth', 'America', 'beautiful', 'when', 'beautiful', 'really', 'monstrous', 'when', 'downhill.As', 'non-American', ""'m"", 'Europe', 'two', 'scenes', 'stuck', 'lightning', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'one', 'when', 'three', 'girls', 'go', 'vomit', 'lunch', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'one', 'laughs', 'one', 'where', 'two', 'boys', 'order', 'fire', 'weapon', 'mail', 'get', 'kicks', 'shooting', 'chopped', 'wood', 'garage.That', 'scene', 'alone', 'should', 'make', 'America', 'rethink', 'attitude', 'guns', 'day', 'such', 'attitude', 'might', 'rethink', 'America']",Elephant

I was totally disappointed and disgusted, especially since this film could have had so much real meaning.  Some criticism of American society and culture was absolutely required in order to do credit to the subject of mass killings in American schools.  But my conclusion after seeing this film was that it was made solely in order to criticize American society.  The tragedy of children dying was just convenient for exploitation.  The screenplay was promising in its approach but it was LOADED down with anti-American bias.  I don't appreciate paying to watch something only to realize it is actually propaganda masquerading as ""art.""  The childish attempts at symbolism with the key killer wearing an Arc de Triomphe T-shirt, playing classical piano pieces reasonably well, then switching to a violent video game, indulging in a last-minute homosexual first kiss and then blowing his classmates and teachers away with absolutely no emotion was all done in a few minutes.  It felt like this film was made for a French audience, particularly an ""artistic"" French film audience at Cannes.  How could they not award this bit of kowtowing to their favorite shallow symbolisms: American violence, the corruption of youth by American industry (software, videogames, etc), specifically a ""cultured"" youth who would have been fine if he had lived near the Arc de Triomphe he admired instead of where he could order guns from the website GUNS USA, and some token homosexual impulses (a 5-second bit added almost as an afterthought).  It had an alcoholic American father, the only parent we actually see in full form and who talks.  The film opens with him sideswiping cars in his perfect American suburban neighborhood and no one noticing.  I knew right then that these film makers had NO CLUE about real American life in a suburb or small town.  The entire rest of the film only confirmed this for me.

No, someone had to let him make this dull, pointless crapola.Ten minute long segments of teens walking around with no dialouge. Then when there is dialouge it's mumbled and useless. Then we are treated to scenes where the camera circles around kids playing football, talking about stuff (nothing of relevance at all, ever) and walking, walking, walking, walking, walking. My girlfriend and I got up and were making food in the kitchen while the movie still played. For a good twenty minutes we could hear it but not see it. There was no dialouge whatsoever and whenever one of us would check in on it, people would be walking around. I guess in the school this takes place in there are no classes and people are free to roam the halls.Early on we get a feeling of impending doom as Gus shows us one underdeveloped, depthless character after another, lining them up for disaster when two black clad kids named Eric and Alex enter the school carrying huge duffle bags. Ooohhh ... Suttle!Then we watch people walk around for another hour. I found myself wanting to see every one of them get butchered just so they would stop walking and just so something, anything, would happen. I even fast forwarded to when the shootings began, but the scenes of violence are so void of panic and dread because there has been no suspense and the audience has been made to feel absolutely nothing for the characters other than mild disdain. I had to turn it off. I could not sit through it.This was plotless garbage that leaned on the dramatic reality of a school shooting for support and somehow managed to make a topic that extreme seem boring as hell.

802264,AJK8D6ELGCX6W,B0001EFUFK,"Renee Floyd ""DeliriousPink""","[5, 9]","Elephant moves at an appropriate pace: slow, steady, and calm. But wait, isn't this movie supposed to be about a high school shooting? Shouldn't there be drama and emotion and gore? Elephant does the seemingly unexpected in its depiction of the Columbine shooting; it provides little or no character development, no sense of justice that the audience is begging for as soon as the first shot is fired. Instead, the movie has abrupt inserts, extraneous footage, repeated scenes, and an overall sense of disconnection. It is uncomfortable, detached, and in the end, abandoning. And that's exactly how Elephant should be.The achievement of this film lies in its appropriateness, its understanding of the subject matter. It quietly excuses itself from all the Hollywood clich&eacute;s and expectations and consciously leaves its audience without closure, without an explanation for the events that take place. At first this inconsiderate abandonment is frustrating, as it ought to be, but considering that the actual Columbine shooting was left unresolved, with no criminals to pursue or punish, creating a hero or triumphant end - or even a slight inkling of remorse from the killers - would be an undeserved privilege.Yet another Hollywood aspect left out of Elephant is violent and dramatic action. The camera rarely concentrates on the victims; the actors fall dead as soon as they are shot, without wailing in pain or gushing out blood; the one explosion in the movie isn't much more than a boom and a cloud of smoke. Rather than glorify the violence of the massacre, the director chooses to portray it almost matter-of-factly. As bewildering as it is to think about a shooting spree on the same level as grocery shopping, it's really the most appropriate method to represent the way the shooters interpret their actions.These kids don't feel much. The audience barely even sees the hatred that could have inspired them to kill their fellow students; what is apparent though is the video game-like way in which they approached their massacre. Point and shoot, point and shoot; 100 bonus points for the principal. The virtual reality of their actions further enhances the sense of disconnection and illusion that characterizes the entire movie.Elephant offers no answers to the events it portrays; the last word one might use to describe this film is ""satisfying.""

I didn't notice any bullying, which might've made the catharsis seem more real. I watched it casually, and it was easy to absorb the lifestyle of these kids; when the replays of certain moments happened, you knew something big was gonna happen. When Erik played the Beethoven piano music, missing lots of notes, you knew something wasn't quite right. He was gratified with it. He was a master in his own eyes.

Gus Van Sant takes advantage of the fact that you already know what his movie is about: a high school shooting. He uses your knowledge to his advantage by playing on the tension you inevitably feel as you wonder, &quot;Will it happen now? Now? Now?&quot; Framing his shots to limit your view, he lets you wonder, all through the movie, what is going on just outside the frame--and eventually forces you to think about how, if many of the kids you're watching would do the same and think about things outside of their own small worlds, the tragic end of the movie might never arrive. But the movie doesn't offer solutions nearly as neat and tidy as that; it simply allows a day to unfold before your eyes, lets you see the world as it's experienced by both the killers and their victims, and shows both how hard it is to see the signs that someone is capable of such a massacre and how easy it might be if people would only pay attention.And then there's the kiss, which has caused Van Sant no small amount of frustration. Without ruining the tension for those of you who choose to give 80 minutes to this movie, I can tell you that at one point the two killers, about to head for school to act out their plan, get in the shower together--or does one ambush the other? I'm really not sure if the first occupant of the shower knows the second will join him; I don't think we're meant to think that this has happened before. But he walks in, joins his only friend, and says, &quot;Today's the day we're going to die...I never even kissed anyone, did you?&quot; Then the two friends, alienated by the rest of the world, are kissing; the shot lingers long enough to make it clear this is more than a quick kiss goodbye--more like an extended, naked make-out session in the shower.And then it's over, and the rest of the movie unfolds, including one event, which I'd love to discuss with anyone who sees it, that made me reinterpret the whole friendship between the two killers and their individual reactions to what happens in the shower.I've made this movie sound like it's filled with action, which isn't fair to those who might consider watching it; much of the 80-minute length of the film is ordinary stuff, like walking down long hallways and playing football and developing film and playing the piano, and much of this plays out without dialogue. I was proud of myself at the end for not speeding up the movie to get down those hallways or get that film developed and clipped; the slight boredom I felt gave my dread an opportunity to build. In the end, this is not an easy film; it won't tell you what you should think about it, and you may not be able to decide on your own what to think, either. I know I haven't.

802269,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001EFUFK,Roland E. Zwick,"[21, 26]","""Elephant"" is Gus Van Sant's brilliant and mind-blowing distillation of teenage alienation and angst.  Set on one of those sterile suburban high school campuses, the film recounts a typical day in the life of a school - typical that is until it ends in a Columbine-type massacre.Here is a film in which style does indeed become substance, where the ""meaning"" lies in the form and shape of the film itself.  Rather than tell us a conventional ""story,"" Van Sant has chosen to give his film the look and feel of a pseudo-documentary, merely recording the events and conversations that occur that day, a day we are led to believe is not unlike every other at that school.  Van Sant's prying camera eye turns us into voyeurs, as we observe the cliquishness, petty humiliations, and sheer overwhelming banality that have defined high school life for so many of us.  Van Sant uses space brilliantly.  Despite the fact that this is undoubtedly a school with a large student population, the characters on whom he focuses seem always to be somehow isolated from almost everyone else around them.  None of the characters we see really seem to have any connection with one another, and even when they do, it tends to be of only the most superficial kind.  They are like people stranded on their own individual islands, enduring their suffering alone and in silence.  Van Sant sets the tone with his tracking shots of characters strolling down seemingly endless corridors heading to nowhere in particular, making little or no human contact as they go.  The camera, throughout the film, seems to have a mind of its own, often avoiding what seems to be a major plot point and, instead, zeroing in on something that seems to have little or no real importance.  Then through the process of editing, he weaves nothing less than a tapestry of alienation.  By concentrating so intently on the seemingly irrelevant minutia of daily life, Van Sant brings to the film a sense of documentary immediacy most fiction films lack.  We are made privy to bits and pieces of conversation only to have the talk dribble off as we or the characters turn the corner and move on to the next group of people.  It is the deadening ""sameness,"" the insignificance of so much of what we see and hear that makes this such a sad and haunting experience.One thing Van Sant refuses to do is try to ""explain"" why the killers act as they do.  He's smart enough to know that there is no single explanation for such behavior, that it arises from a variety of sources and that it is primarily the product of a general feeling of alienation in modern society.  We see one of the murderers suffering humiliation at the hands of two schoolmates, the second killer playing a violent video game and perusing a gun magazine, but these, in and of themselves, cannot be the sole explanations.  At best they are symptoms of a much deeper societal sickness, one that Van Sant can only hint at but never fully grasp - for who among us can claim to truly understand it?  What ""Elephant"" does is to make us focus on and actually see this spirit-crushing ennui which permeates our culture and which defines life for so many of our youngsters.The director has drawn fine work from his cast of talented unknowns.  Their every word, their every gesture rings believable and true.  He has also employed Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"" to serve as a haunting refrain throughout the film, capturing the poignancy of a world in which beauty, spontaneity and joy seem to have been removed.There are some who will find ""Elephant"" to be slow-moving, empty, arty and pretentious.  For them there are plenty of mindlessly upbeat depictions of high school life to watch.

Based on the Columbine events, Van Sant succeeds in delivering the feeling of dread as the movie goes on. And he does that by introducing as many characters as possible and by following them in their daily activities at school, this leading to have certain scenes repeated more than once from different perspectives.Yes, the directing style may feel a little bit awkward at the beginning, but that is the whole idea. The film is not treated like an ordinary movie, it really takes you there and shows you how this type of things can happen when you least expect it. There is no character development I agree, but the director's point was to present it as real as possible; while others criticize the fact that the camera follows some students during their long walks in corridors or fields, I personally find it interesting as these scenes show you some interaction between characters with no cuts between them, something that is not usual neither easy to accomplish.The film's tension builds as you see what is about to happen, yet you do not know why, when or how it will. Why these kids do what they do is not explained, some of their reasons to be angry are mentioned briefly but no more details or explanations are given. That's the way this movie works, shows you the facts only and lets you do the thinking.The movie has an audio track on DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 which is good, but the movie doesn't really have that much of music or sound effects to consider it an added value. A `Making of' is also included, while short is a little bit illustrative of the process of making the film, recommended to watch.A crude, real and interesting film, `Elephant' will leave you thinking after watching it. Sadly, we have seen this in real life from our perspective; Van Sant takes you there and leaves the reasons or explanations for you to think of. Why the name `Elephant'?

These students have walked these halls hundreds of times on hundreds of days and nothing has disrupted them...until this day.The violence that befalls the school is not shocking...we see it coming. What is fabulous to watch is the confusion of the inhabitants of the school when the catastrophe begins. They have no idea what is going on and several are snuffed before they figure it out.What I find unsatisfying about an otherwise remarkable film is the ending...there is no real conclusion. I tend to like a little more closure to my movies than ""Elephant"" offers.The young actors of ""Elephant"" are excellent and Gus Van Sant's direction is commendable.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[1, 2]","This film has received quite polarizing reviews; some praised its understated brilliance while others bashed it for its lack of action and dialogue and its tortoise-like pace. In my opinion ELEPHANT falls somewhere in between. The viewer is introduced to a variety of students at an anonymous high school in America. The camera follows behind them as the students engage in their everyday activities resulting in a clear sense of being a voyeur. There are periodic sound bites of somber piano music along with many stretches of the silence of walking down the school hallway. The tone of the beginning of this film reminds me of the calm before the storm: the interplaying of scenes of the two kids mail ordering guns and target practicing in the garage is a clear indication that something big is about to happen and there's no way to warn the others.There is little doubt that ELEPHANT is far from the center of filmmaking. It fails to explain any reasoning behind the massacre of the school shooting and the viewer is left with an unsettled taste in their stomach, especially after watching the final scene. However, this aspect clearly mirrors how school shootings are always clouded in mystery as to the killers intentions and motivations. In a nutshell this film is simply one individual's interpretation of a Columbine-like event.

As a result, he was able to make a film like ""Elephant.""  It's a good movie, but it won't appeal to a lot of people.This is a movie about a school shooting that brings to mind the events at Columbine High School.  The movie is strictly shot as a narrative.  It doesn't try to explain the mindset of the shooters.  It doesn't try to reationalize the things that happened.  It doesn't include any drama or heroes.  It doesn't place blame on any one thing, like violent movies or games.  It can be assumed that the director's opinion is there was no explanation for what happened, and there was no way to prevent it.Over the course of the film, you see different kids going to school and living their lives.  Different scenes are replayed, as it follows normal kids through their normal routines.  You don't kid to know much about the kids, you just see them in their element.  Some of these kids survive, some don't--and that's just through chance.Some people will find this movie boring.  There are long scenes without any dialog.  There is violence, but it's not sensationalized--it just happens.  Again, there is no explanation in the end.  No theories.  No rationalizations.  No big, political statements.

802277,A37YE2WSA1GUOF,B0001EFUFK,Sean P. Pidgeon,"[4, 5]","There is an old Hindu legend about six blind men who come upon an elephant. One thought the elephant like a wall, the second like a spear, the third thought it a snake, number four a tree, five a fan, and six thought the elephant like a rope. They bickered and argued over who was right, when each could only experience the elephant from his own perspective. (click here for the poem ""The Blind Men and the Elephant: [...])Last night, I viewed Gus Van Sant's 2003 film Elephant. Van Sant is the directory of Good Will Hunting, one of my favorite movies, as well as director of Finding Forrester (for a classic Sean Connery line, go to [...] and turn the volume up). Elephant is Van Sant's look at a typical high school day from the eyes of a handful of students, except that it is not a typical day. As an attempt at realism, we do not see ""real"" actors, but rather, real high school students, told to create their own dialogue, and simply allow the camera to follow them.We open with a car swerving around the neighborhood before abruptly crash stopping in front blond haired John, to the tune of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata in the background. John makes his obviously drunk father hand over the keys and switch to the passenger seat, so that he may drive himself to school. The camera follows John as he walks around school, leaving behind the background sonata that graced our journey to a day of learning. John's travels include stopping to pose for Elias, another student and an amateur photographer, receiving a kiss on the cheek from Acadia during a sad moment, and leaving the building as Alex and Eric are about to enter, carrying heavy bags. We receive an ominous sign with Alex's warning to John, ""Get the [heck] out and don't come back! Some heavy [stuff]'s going down!""Our next guide is Elias, photographing a gothic couple on his walk to school, developing a roll in water in the school's lab, and stopping blond haired John, and requesting he pose for some photographs. We also see football star Nathan leave practice, walk down the hall to the notice of three admiring girls, before meeting up with girlfriend Carrie. They have a lot to talk about, and the camera makes sure we witness. There is Michelle, in sadness walking down the hallway, walking by Nathan before he meets up with Carrie. We meet three girls, noticing Nathan walking towards Carrie, disgusted that he is taken. Through the windows we can see John leaving school and Alex and Eric walking toward the doors. The three girls will have lunch and throw up in the bathroom, Michelle will receive a talking to from a teacher about refusing to wear gym class shorts. We see Eric get picked on, and Alex sit at his piano to break the long musical silence in the film with Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Everyone has problems and hurts. Everyone is in emotional flux. We may look upon their problems as petty or small, but to a teenager in transition, small things really can affect one's emotional well-being. If anything, for those who have forgotten, we are reminded that high school is not an easy time.From the first frame, we can sense that something seems wrong, even in a seemingly ordinary day. The relatively early glimpse of Alex and Eric alerts us to what will transpire. Yet, our anticipation and angst are never met with an explanation before the final scene of violence erupts. No explanation is given. We do not come to an understanding. In naming his film Elephant, Van Sant could be saying that there is no answer, explanation, or solution to horrendous acts such as these. Like in the parable above, each blind man experiences the elephant from his own perspective. We all see things differently. In order to find a cure, first we must have a correct diagnosis to the illness. What is the ""illness"" that causes troubled youth to engage in acts of school violence? Van Sant throws his hands up. He does not know. All of the characters we meet have problems, so why did these two end up being the ones? Some of the characters we meet die and some do not, yet we do not see a reason why. We are left with the Moonlight Sonota and no closure.",4,Elephant,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,4134,"['old', 'Hindu', 'legend', 'six', 'blind', 'men', 'who', 'come', 'elephant', 'One', 'thought', 'elephant', 'wall', 'second', 'spear', 'third', 'thought', 'snake', 'number', 'four', 'tree', 'five', 'fan', 'six', 'thought', 'elephant', 'rope', 'bickered', 'argued', 'who', 'was', 'right', 'when', 'could', 'only', 'experience', 'elephant', 'own', 'perspective', 'click', 'here', 'poem', 'Blind', 'Men', 'Elephant', '[', ']', 'Last', 'night', 'viewed', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', '2003', 'film', 'Elephant', 'Van', 'Sant', 'directory', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'classic', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'line', 'go', '[', ']', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', 'Elephant', 'Van', 'Sant', 'look', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'day', 'eyes', 'handful', 'students', 'not', 'typical', 'day', 'attempt', 'realism', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'real', 'actors', 'rather', 'real', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'told', 'create', 'own', 'dialogue', 'simply', 'allow', 'camera', 'follow', 'them.We', 'open', 'car', 'swerving', 'neighborhood', 'abruptly', 'crash', 'stopping', 'front', 'blond', 'haired', 'John', 'tune', 'Beethoven', 'Moonlight', 'Sonata', 'background', 'John', 'obviously', 'drunk', 'father', 'hand', 'keys', 'switch', 'passenger', 'seat', 'so', 'may', 'drive', 'school', 'camera', 'John', 'school', 'leaving', 'background', 'sonata', 'graced', 'journey', 'day', 'learning', 'John', 'travels', 'include', 'stopping', 'pose', 'Elias', 'student', 'amateur', 'photographer', 'receiving', 'kiss', 'cheek', 'Acadia', 'sad', 'moment', 'leaving', 'building', 'Alex', 'Eric', 'are', 'enter', 'carrying', 'heavy', 'bags', 'receive', 'ominous', 'sign', 'Alex', 'warning', 'John', 'Get', '[', 'heck', ']', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'heavy', '[', 'stuff', ']', 'going', 'down', 'next', 'guide', 'Elias', 'photographing', 'gothic', 'couple', 'walk', 'school', 'developing', 'roll', 'water', 'school', 'lab', 'stopping', 'blond', 'haired', 'John', 'requesting', 'pose', 'photographs', 'also', 'see', 'football', 'star', 'Nathan', 'leave', 'practice', 'walk', 'hall', 'notice', 'three', 'admiring', 'girls', 'meeting', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Carrie', 'have', 'lot', 'talk', 'camera', 'sure', 'witness', 'Michelle', 'sadness', 'walking', 'down', 'hallway', 'walking', 'Nathan', 'up', 'Carrie', 'meet', 'three', 'girls', 'noticing', 'Nathan', 'walking', 'towards', 'Carrie', 'disgusted', 'taken', 'windows', 'can', 'see', 'John', 'leaving', 'school', 'Alex', 'Eric', 'walking', 'doors', 'three', 'girls', 'will', 'have', 'lunch', 'throw', 'up', 'bathroom', 'Michelle', 'will', 'receive', 'talking', 'teacher', 'refusing', 'wear', 'gym', 'class', 'shorts', 'see', 'Eric', 'get', 'picked', 'Alex', 'sit', 'piano', 'break', 'long', 'musical', 'silence', 'film', 'Beethoven', 'Moonlight', 'Sonata', 'Everyone', 'problems', 'hurts', 'Everyone', 'emotional', 'flux', 'may', 'look', 'problems', 'petty', 'small', 'teenager', 'transition', 'small', 'things', 'really', 'can', 'affect', 'one', 'emotional', 'well-being', 'anything', 'who', 'have', 'forgotten', 'are', 'reminded', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'easy', 'time.From', 'first', 'frame', 'can', 'sense', 'something', 'wrong', 'even', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'day', 'relatively', 'early', 'glimpse', 'Alex', 'Eric', 'what', 'will', 'transpire', 'anticipation', 'angst', 'are', 'never', 'met', 'explanation', 'final', 'scene', 'violence', 'erupts', 'explanation', 'given', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'understanding', 'naming', 'film', 'Elephant', 'Van', 'Sant', 'could', 'be', 'saying', 'answer', 'explanation', 'solution', 'horrendous', 'acts', 'such', 'parable', 'blind', 'man', 'elephant', 'own', 'perspective', 'see', 'things', 'differently', 'order', 'find', 'cure', 'first', 'must', 'have', 'correct', 'diagnosis', 'illness', 'What', 'illness', 'troubled', 'youth', 'engage', 'acts', 'school', 'violence', 'Van', 'Sant', 'hands', 'up', 'not', 'know', 'characters', 'meet', 'have', 'problems', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'ones', 'characters', 'meet', 'die', 'do', 'not', 'yet', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'are', 'left', 'Moonlight', 'Sonota', 'closure']",Elephant

The film explores a typical day in a Colorado high school, which is brought to a screeching halt because of Columbine-like violence. It proves to be a tiger of film, as I couldn't stop thinking about it and how powerful it was for weeks after my viewing.Again, working from a nonexistent script and improvisational dialogue, this time Van Sant employed real high school students who used their real first names. I haven't been out of high school long, and this film struck me with its honesty and accuracy in portraying an ""every day"" lifestyle of the high schoolers of America. Many people criticized Elephant, calling it irresponsible to portray a subject of such importance and not tie any of the loose ends or give reasons for the tragedy. However, it is completely true that Elephant's responsibility comes from this refusal to explain Columbine and other instances like it. Van Sant has no more answers than the rest of us, and he wouldn't dare pretend to.The title was in reference to an old proverb Van Sant remembered hearing in which a group of blind men all try to describe an elephant, but come up with completely different answers because they were examining only a piece of the whole. Other's have equated it with the idea of the elephant in a room, clearly there, but completely missed for whatever reason. The complex and impressive narrative style is perfectly reflective of Sant's explanation of the title, with it's long tracking shots and tendency to follow one character for long periods of time giving the impression that other aspects of the story are being missed. Some of the day's actions are overlapped from multiple perspectives giving new meaning to the event each time (a technique also utilized in Satantango, a film by Hungarian director Bela Tarr). Yet once the film is done, the viewer knows that it wouldn't matter how much of the story they got, it would still be an ultimate mystery. Never in real life has a story been constructed with all of the facts in place. Elephant recognizes this, thus making it an incredibly mature coverage of a highly sensationalized topic and most definitely my favorite film of 2003.Whether you loved or hated them, Elephant and Gerry  are two films that are hard to ignore.

The camera floats around an ordinary school, tracking students' lives, nothing special, your average day stuff, in what seemed like a thinly veiled take on the Columbine tragedy of school shootings.There are no good guys and bad guys, every character is made sympathetic simply by being real, by being himself, by being human. This includes the two weirdos who go on a rampage, who played violent video games (like most teenagers) and  watched documentaries on Hitler with rapt attention. Not sure if this was an implied cause, or just a nonchalant and thus somehow artistic trope.That's it. That's the plot.

This is hard to believe because you'd expect a film like this-with its disturbing subject matter-to draw a little more attention to itself. I had heard that it gained a bit of attention at Sundance, and that it was going to be one of the most controversial films of the year, but it didn't turn out to be that way. Instead, people just blasted Gus Van Sant for even attempting to make the film, ridiculing him and brushing the film off as if it meant nothing-a flawed cinematic acheivement.Alot of these people that persecuted him really, as it turns out, don't know what they are talking about. They dismissed it as nothing but a series of endless tracking shots, following one student after another until the horrifying climax, adding up to nothing, and offering no answers, no easy way out for the audience. What they don't know is that that is the whole point of the film. It follows each individual or group of students around for minutes at a time so we can get an idea of who they are, what they're like-their humanity. These are just ordinary kids at and ordinary school in Anywhere, USA. They had no idea that two conflicted youths were going to walk in the school any minute and start blasting away. It's all an effort to get the feel of an ordinary day in high school. Believe it or not, each day doesn't just fly by. High school, depending on your experience, can be a long, boring, drawn out experience. Gus Van Sant wants the audience to &quot;get it&quot;, but sadly not many people who have seen this film did. Thats very unfortunate, because the series of events that follow the observations of each student are so horrifying and sad that you don't even know what to think once the film is over. You feel like you got to know each of these kids for a while, even though all we did was follow each of them from a distance for a few minutes. I can't really explain how I feel after watching it.

There will likely never be another time in my life as chilling, horrible and painful as that experience and so for me, part of me was secretly egging the killers on. Indeed at the end i wanted him to kneecap the jock bully, blow his kneecaps off and his ears off and then leave him alive. And that is part of the theme, the two quiet victims operating in the lowest caste of high school completely reverse their situation, all the powerless they endured, the fear and humiliation they return with interest. Their anger is obtuse and indiscriminate, their need to achieve a sense of self-empowerment  so great that all others must be brought down, their isolation from their peers so profound that they cannot tell who deserves it and who doesnt.The film makes interesting characterisations, we have the nice guys ie the photography fans and we have another member of the low highschool caste - the self conscious girl with the curly black hair. The girl portrays the idea of a truly innocent victim, she is farthest from those who have bullied the killers, in killing her without thinking about it they erase any sympathy we have for their motives. The insecurity of the anxious curly haired girl is ironically matched by the three popular girls who's bulimia provides a striking match for the body-insecurity of the curly haired girl who refuses to wear shorts at PE. I agree with some peoples observations that the film is quite boring in places, i feel this works on an artistic level to some degree as drama is not reality and the film's goal is to portray the reality of school life.

We know the film is NOT about an ordinary day in a fictional highschool in Oregon (a disused school stands for the film's one), where the camera follows the ordinary students and teachers (and a drunk father) played mostly by amateurs.  So ""John"" is played by John Robinson, and ""Alex"" by Alex Frost, and so on, excpet the few professional actors like Timothy Bottoms as John's dad.And the tragic thing happens, which I don't think needs further explanation.  The film depicts the two boys' atrocious deed with drab, realistic touch, being intent on showing the things as they are.The film is, to me, unnnerving, and is never boring for I know what will happen in the end, and clearly Gus Van Sant knows the effects coming from that.  The film's long, continous shot as if floating in the air works to make the unsettling effects even though some may say, quite rightly, that the director is self-indulgent in sticking to the intention, not culculating the effects on us, like many arty films do.In fact, the minutely worked-out camerawork is quite memorable, to be fair, and the actors are very good and convincing though it is palpable that they are not trained pros.  At least they are natural, and as a whole, promising if they want to continue the job.  (Actually John Robinson went on to be in next Asia Argent-directed film.)What I do not understand about the film is ... hard to explain, but the fact the film is made at all.  I know this is a slice of life in 1999 April 20th, but do we have to watch this ""thought-provoking film"" (which it is) while we are still thinking about the incident?  I respect the director's decision to leave out any attempt to explain how come this happened, but after watching it the film starts to look pointless, even though that may be exactly what it aims for.I said the film does not explain; in fact, it does.  There is a suggestion about Nati, violent video game, Internet, and even the boys' sexuality.  Probably Van Sant wants to criticize, with these references, the possible ""causes"" suggested by the media.

Unfortunately, the movie's brief running time and style prevents us from really getting to know these kids.  Little is shown about the characters' lives or internal processes - I felt no emotional investment in any of them.  As a result, the film has a somewhat voyeuristic tone; we're seeing people we don't know in uncomfortable situations.  Furthermore, prior films have offered much greater insight into bullying, notably ""Welcome to the Dollhouse.""

It's a film that depicts alienation and isolation amongst teens like few films have (films like Todd Solondz's ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and Terry Zwigoff's ""Ghost World"" come to mind). It shows a realistic day-in-the-life of a group of teenagers, and as you see them walk through the halls, you come to the conclusion that it is nothing but a normal day for them. The first time I saw this, it stayed with me for days, mostly due to the fact that I could relate to some of the characters.

This isn't a subject or a story that requires quick cuts and shaky character development to tell.What Van Sant manages to do is to show, in a beautifully tragic way, just how ordinary the school day was, and how surprising and explosive the events really were or could be.Following the long shots, at several points overlapping from different angles and different characters, the audience begins to create a visual image of all the activity occuring on a school campus at any given time. The understated performances by all the young actors add another layer of perfection to the film by making it all feel painfully realistic.When the shooting finally does start, in the last 10 minutes of the film, it's almost like the viewer has been lulled into a false sense of security, much like the students in the school have been. Overall, this film is terrifically and tastefully done and it's definitely worth watching whether you're interested in Columbine or not. Elephant is just good filmmaking.The DVD is 2-sided with the feature on one side and special features on the other. The special features are pretty weak. There's a making of featurette, but it's pretty much the worst making of I've ever seen. There's no discussion from the director on what he was trying to do or say, there's a few different cast members describing what their definition of violence is... other than that it's just shots of them making the film.",5,Tragically beautiful film showcasing a great filmmaker,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,1835,"['Elephant', 'understated', 'incredibly', 'haunting', 'film', 'account', 'how', 'day', 'Columbine', 'shootings', 'might', 'have', 'progressed.With', 'long', 'amazingly', 'detailed', 'subtle', 'steadicam', 'shots', 'most', 'several', 'minutes', 'length', 'director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'cast', 'characters', 'typical', 'daily', 'school', 'lives', 'reviewers', 'may', 'call', 'tactic', 'boring', 'think', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point', 'entirely', ""n't"", 'subject', 'story', 'quick', 'cuts', 'shaky', 'character', 'development', 'tell.What', 'Van', 'Sant', 'do', 'show', 'beautifully', 'tragic', 'way', 'just', 'how', 'ordinary', 'school', 'day', 'was', 'how', 'surprising', 'explosive', 'events', 'really', 'were', 'could', 'be.Following', 'long', 'shots', 'several', 'points', 'overlapping', 'different', 'angles', 'different', 'characters', 'audience', 'create', 'visual', 'image', 'activity', 'occuring', 'school', 'campus', 'given', 'time', 'understated', 'performances', 'young', 'actors', 'add', 'layer', 'perfection', 'film', 'making', 'feel', 'painfully', 'realistic.When', 'shooting', 'finally', 'start', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'almost', 'viewer', 'been', 'lulled', 'false', 'sense', 'security', 'much', 'students', 'school', 'have', 'been', 'Overall', 'film', 'terrifically', 'tastefully', 'done', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Columbine', 'not', 'Elephant', 'just', 'good', 'filmmaking.The', 'DVD', '2-sided', 'feature', 'one', 'side', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'weak', 'making', 'featurette', 'pretty', 'much', 'worst', 'making', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'discussion', 'director', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'say', 'few', 'different', 'cast', 'members', 'describing', 'what', 'definition', 'violence', 'other', 'just', 'shots', 'making', 'film']",Elephant
