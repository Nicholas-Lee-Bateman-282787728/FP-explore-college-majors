The DVD and video are readily available through Amazon in the US, but not here in Australia, so I count myself very lucky to have been given a copy by a friend. Judi Dench was the 15 year old, schoolgirl, saxaphone playing star of an all-girl band during the days of WW2, in London. The male musicians had been called up so, as many women took on men's jobs, the Bombshells played on as one of the top dance bands of the day. Only one of the band members was a ring-in..the drummer, played by Ian Holm, was a draft dodger who played in full make up and a blonde wig. Fifty years later and after the death of her husband, Judi decides to get the band together for a reunion and to play at her granddaughter's school dance. The coming together of these diverse characters is so funny...a drunk, a jailbird, a Salvation Army lassie, a former French resistance fighter who can kill with her bare hands and the others who are still alive (and lucid), including the fabulous Cleo Laine who still sings up a storm.

But the script is extraordinarily superficial, and its moral overtone is tedious: all that matters in life is to be young and have sex. The Christian in the film is considered a loony.  While the Olympia Dukakis character, a many times married drunk, is just a heck of a lot of fun.  And so on.  The flashbacks to the 1940s are not at all persuasive, especially the makeup.  And the sound that tiny band produces is made in fact by a much larger group.  The actors do pretty well at pretending to be musicians, with the notable exception of Leslie Caron.

In the interests of the environment we had him incinerated."" So speaks Elizabeth (Judi Dench), George's widow. She's led a comfortable, predictable life with George. She has two grown children and a 12-year-old grandchild. But when she was 15 and in school, in the midst of World War II, she played the sax at night in an all-girl (almost all-girl) band called The Blonde Bombshells. The 'almost"" was because the drummer was Patrick, a charming rogue who had no desire to fight and possibly be killed. With a yellow wig, a long red dress and makeup, Patrick looked almost as good as the others.One afternoon after the funeral, Elizabeth finds herself in the attic of her home playing the sax she had put away. She used to practice, but only when George was out of the house on the golf course. Then two things happen. Her granddaughter, amazed at how good Elizabeth is, starts talking about how the Blonde Bombshells could be reunited and play at her school dance. Then Elizabeth encounters Patrick (Ian Holm), now just as much an aging oldster as Elizabeth, and just as much attracted to her as he was more than 50 years ago. (He also was attracted to all the other members of the Bombshells. The roses that would appear on his bass drum had a special meaning that attested to his affection.) Well, why not see if the other band members can be located, and why not give it a shot for a reunion performance at her granddaughter's school?Why not? One member of the band is gaga. One is dead. One is in jail. One has found salvation with the Salvation Army. One they can find no trace of. One is last known to be in the States. One is a professional singer and has no intention of doing a school gig, even for a reunion. But one by one Elizabeth and Patrick bring together the surviving members of the Bombshells. We don't know if enough of them can be found. The rehearsals more often than not turn into off-key shambles. While they do this, we share Elizabeth's flashbacks of what life was like when she and Patrick were young in war-time London, playing in the band while the bombs were falling. As terrible as it was, it was the most exciting time of their lives. When the night of Elizabeth's granddaughter's dance arrives, of course, the Blonde Bombshells, filled with jitters and renewed friendship, blow the youngsters away. Afterwards, Elizabeth informs us that the Bombshells are continuing to play at gigs, and that she and Patrick have no plans to get married...but see nothing wrong with a little fooling around.This is sentimental hogwash, expertly done, and not bad at all. What makes it work are the skill and charm of Judi Dench and Ian Holm. When I hear the term, ""warm-hearted comedy,"" I usually cringe unless the actors are first-rate. Dench and Holm are wonders to watch as they take something as light-weight and predictable as this script and turn it into something that charms us. Then there's the ""old broad"" gambit that's fun if you remember the old broads. Among the Blonde Bombshells are Leslie Caron, Joan Sims, Olympia Dukakis, Billie Whitelaw and Cleo Laine. Laine sings three numbers and almost over-balances the production. She is so strong and unique a jazz talent that while she's singing the program nearly becomes the Cleo Laine Show. Another attractive feature is the number of great WWII songs played in strong swing.The DVD picture looks just fine. There are a couple of inconsequential extras.",4,"""Sentimental, warm-hearted comedy...""

She starts by returning to the music she played during World War 2, when she belonged to an all-girl band called The Blonde Bombshells. However, when she runs into Patrick (Ian Holm), the drummer from The Blond Bombshells (OK, they couldn&#8217;t find a girl drummer), she hits on the idea of bringing the Blonde Bombshells back together. However, that&#8217;s easier said than done--some are dead, some have left the country, one has lost her sanity, one has found God, and all are scattered. However, Elizabeth is not a woman to give up easily. This is the story of nostalgia, overcoming, the love of music...and so much more!

It is a sort of roll call for some great old girls, ballasted by the presence of Ian Holm, playing a transvestite part at second hand.  (Don't ask.)  It offers some good forties-style big band numbers and a couple of fine Cleo Laine songs.  And if Laine's musical style happens to be incorrect for the intended period, who really cares?This is a TV movie made without high goals.It could and should have been better.  The whole thing, rebuilding the band to the contrary, is conceived as a long dying fall.  The Blonde Bombshells are a band destined to go gentle into that good night.  No raging against the loss of light for them.  Both the script and the direction avoid triumph.  At the climax, where there might just as easily have been a YEAH! moment, there is only a wistful smile and a vision of things past.This is true not only of the script but of the musical score.  In the end, as was inevitable from the first frame of this picture, the reconstituted Blonde Bombshells get the joint jumping with a swinging tune.  Having attained that high point, it is immediately squelched by the following wistfully downbeat number. Reverse those two and the audience would be dancing around the screen.Solid, well-acted, some good music, certainly entertaining--but a movie that sets its sights a little too low.Four stars.DVD STUFF: There are no bells and whistles.

All too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music, and help to fill in the background to the band members, and in particular to the girls' relationships with the lone male member - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to dodge the call-up).Ian Holm (""Lord of The Rings"", ""Cromwell and Fairfax"") and Judi Dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed Elizabeth, and the conniving, womanizing Patrick, the drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band's leader, now playing bar piano at the sea-side, and June Whitfield glows as the Salvation Army trombone player. Cameo appearances by other greats like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The movie is a romp down memory lane, with an all star cast of what ought, by all rights, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look as good at their age! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years of age. She certainly still gets my pulse going! As I watched it, I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age.
