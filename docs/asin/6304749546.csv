I thought it was a show for kids, one that didn't have much bearing on me.  As I watched it more, especially on Nick at Nite when there was nothing else on, I began to realize that this show was unique.  Not only did it appeal to younger audiences with its light-hearted humor, but that it even appealed to middle to late teenagers like me, with its displays of Kevin's relationships, his feelings, and his growth as a person.  This show deals with practically every difficulty that adolescents must face, from strange parents to changing friends.  It is rare that a show has actually been able to reach out and touch my heart, but it seems that this show is able to do it whenever I watch it.  My only wish was that they had the entire series available, so that I could watch it from start to finish.",5,The Most Touching and Heartwarming Show I have ever seen,997315200,"08 9, 2001",2001,882,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'episode', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'show', 'kids', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'bearing', 'watched', 'more', 'especially', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'when', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'began', 'realize', 'show', 'was', 'unique', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audiences', 'light-hearted', 'humor', 'even', 'appealed', 'middle', 'late', 'teenagers', 'displays', 'Kevin', 'relationships', 'feelings', 'growth', 'person', 'show', 'practically', 'difficulty', 'must', 'face', 'strange', 'parents', 'changing', 'friends', 'rare', 'show', 'actually', 'been', 'able', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'heart', 'show', 'able', 'do', 'whenever', 'watch', 'My', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'had', 'entire', 'series', 'available', 'could', 'watch', 'start', 'finish']",The Christmas Wonder Years - The Holiday Episodes VHS

No offense to the other two great shows, I just think that one captured the essence of Christmas to perfection. The quality of the dvd is much better then the ""Best Of"" dvd that was released to promote the show and the two Christmas episodes are filled with bittersweet remembrance and the nostalgia that creeps around during the holiday season.
