373248,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6303410847,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","What an underappreciated treasure James Caan is!  With little fanfare he's accumulated a solid body of work and this film, the only one where he held the director's reins, is no exception.  He delivers a solid film without resorting to any fluorishes that would draw attention away from the story.  For instance it's set in 1967 but Caan does not resort to cliched period details like annoying soundtrack music to advertise the time and place.  It's his performance as Thomas Macklin, a hard working blue-collar divorced dad whose children are whisked away from him by some overzealous feds, that's front and center here.  Caan forcefully projects the anger and heartbreak of a guy who follows the rules who feels betrayed by the government he fought to protect.  It's unfortunate, however, that this is not a perfect film.  I found the mob types and Witness Protection folk presented here to be a mite on the cliched side.  The story ends a little too pat and abruptly to suit my taste.  That said, four-fifths of an orange is better than none at all and ""Hide In Plain Sight"" is near the top of the class.",4,James Caan Excels On Both Sides of the Camera,1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,1107,"['What', 'underappreciated', 'treasure', 'James', 'Caan', 'little', 'fanfare', 'accumulated', 'solid', 'body', 'work', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'where', 'held', 'director', 'reins', 'exception', 'solid', 'film', 'resorting', 'fluorishes', 'would', 'draw', 'attention', 'away', 'story', 'instance', 'set', '1967', 'Caan', 'not', 'resort', 'cliched', 'period', 'details', 'annoying', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'advertise', 'time', 'place', 'performance', 'Thomas', 'Macklin', 'hard', 'working', 'blue-collar', 'divorced', 'dad', 'children', 'are', 'whisked', 'away', 'overzealous', 'feds', 'front', 'center', 'here', 'Caan', 'forcefully', 'projects', 'anger', 'heartbreak', 'guy', 'who', 'rules', 'who', 'feels', 'betrayed', 'government', 'fought', 'protect', 'unfortunate', 'however', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'found', 'mob', 'types', 'Witness', 'Protection', 'folk', 'presented', 'here', 'be', 'mite', 'cliched', 'side', 'story', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'abruptly', 'suit', 'taste', 'said', 'four-fifths', 'orange', 'better', 'none', 'Hide', 'Plain', 'Sight', 'top', 'class']",Hide in Plain Sight VHS

Check it out when he finally finds his kids and his reaction--only a true actor could be this good.  This should be on DVD--hope it will be in the future.  Check out other James Caan flicks in the meantime like The Gambler and the Godfather!!!

373250,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,6303410847,Pork Chop,"[0, 0]","Hide in Plain Sight (1980) is a movie that has a 1970's feelto it, insofar as it demonstrates mature relationships betweenwomen and men, and takes a sober, realistic view of the highs andlows of working men and women. e.g.  parenthood, hobbies likegoing fishing, baseball games - showing a time when people hadtime to breathe, think and enjoy simple activities, as opposed tothe increasingly frantic pace of modern life in North America.Set in the inner city, the most obvious visual changes touch uponthe  vehicles driven and new technology (telephones, etc.) in thisday and age.Here, James Caan plays a hard-working family man that is divorcedfrom the mother of his 2 childen, who leaves to marry a hot-headwho is associated with underground gang activities.Danny Aiello takes on the case, as a courageous, idealisticattorney, who believes in family values, and in placing limits onan out-of-control big government, that tends to answer to nobody,except perhaps the mass media and public opinion. This is the casemainly from fears on the potential impact at the ballot box forCongress, the Senate and the Whitehouse.The editing, music, the calm paced nature of the movie is positive,counter-balancing the more sinister aspects of the story, suchas a hold-up in a bank, a witness protection program that is clumsilyrun, conflict in the workplace from Machevellian characters, governmentworkers showing in rare cases sloth, etc.The morale of the story is to not underestimate the natural tiesbetween parents and their children, to those who insert themselvesbetween the two.",2,Balanced story about family values when caught by witness programs,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1574,"['Hide', 'Plain', 'Sight', '1980', 'movie', '1970', 'feelto', 'insofar', 'mature', 'relationships', 'betweenwomen', 'men', 'sober', 'realistic', 'view', 'highs', 'andlows', 'working', 'men', 'women', 'e.g', 'parenthood', 'hobbies', 'likegoing', 'fishing', 'baseball', 'games', 'showing', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'hadtime', 'breathe', 'think', 'enjoy', 'simple', 'activities', 'opposed', 'tothe', 'increasingly', 'frantic', 'pace', 'modern', 'life', 'North', 'America.Set', 'inner', 'city', 'most', 'obvious', 'visual', 'changes', 'touch', 'uponthe', 'vehicles', 'driven', 'new', 'technology', 'telephones', 'etc', 'thisday', 'age.Here', 'James', 'Caan', 'hard-working', 'family', 'man', 'mother', '2', 'childen', 'who', 'marry', 'hot-headwho', 'associated', 'underground', 'gang', 'activities.Danny', 'Aiello', 'case', 'courageous', 'idealisticattorney', 'who', 'family', 'values', 'placing', 'limits', 'onan', 'out-of-control', 'big', 'government', 'answer', 'nobody', 'perhaps', 'mass', 'media', 'public', 'opinion', 'casemainly', 'fears', 'potential', 'impact', 'ballot', 'box', 'forCongress', 'Senate', 'Whitehouse.The', 'editing', 'music', 'calm', 'paced', 'nature', 'movie', 'positive', 'counter-balancing', 'more', 'sinister', 'aspects', 'story', 'suchas', 'hold-up', 'bank', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'clumsilyrun', 'conflict', 'workplace', 'Machevellian', 'characters', 'governmentworkers', 'showing', 'rare', 'cases', 'sloth', 'etc.The', 'morale', 'story', 'not', 'underestimate', 'natural', 'tiesbetween', 'parents', 'children', 'who', 'insert', 'two']",Hide in Plain Sight VHS
373251,A2TBN90L5KP085,6303410847,Steven Zoraster,"[8, 8]","James Caan is an actor I associate with rolls in which his character dishes out a notable amount of willful and nasty violence.  For example,  ""The Godfather"", ""The Killer Elite"",  ""Flesh and Bone"" and ""Eraser.""  Even  some of his less violent rolls, like ""Garden of Stone"" still depend on his  tough persona.  ""Hide in Plain Sight"" has Caan playing a remarkably subdued  and complex character. In fact, the violence in this movie, if you can call  it that, is mostly emotional tension.In the movie, Caan plays a  divorced father, whose rather dumb former wife and her slimly new husband  disappear into a government witness relocation program along with Caan's  two young children.  Caan, whose movie job is an anonymous laborer in a  tire factory, is revealed to be a former Vietnam era marine. But in this  movie, the emphasis is on Caan the plain working man, deeply caring father,  and, up to a point, a person willing to wait for the government to do the  right thing, which is to return his own kids to his safekeeping.In his  roll, Caan is fully believable as someone who could have made a stupid  decision about who to marry eight or nine years ago.  He is a strong man  who keeps everything under control not because he is anyway repressed, but  because he is what he appears to be, a basically nice guy.  (By the way,  the movie was also directed by Caan.)The movie is neatly divided into  three parts.  The first introduces Caan, some of his friends from the  factory. his former wife and her low-level mobster boyfriend, and the  boyfriend's high level, and obviously very dangerous, mobster friends. It  highlights Caan's close relationship with his kids, and his new love  interest, played by Jill Eikenberry.  It also sets up a reason for the mob  and the boyfriend's interests to move in different directions.  Dividing  interests which lead the boyfriend to testify against his former associates  and then move immediately on into the witness relocation program, sweeping  Caan's former wife and kids along with him.The second third of the movie  shows Caan's repeatedly frustrated attempts to find his kids.  At the most  basic level the interest of the government is to deny evolvement, deny Caan  any parental rights (the mother had custody of the kids), and if that  doesn't work, avoid talking to him.  There are some nice scenes here  establishing the character and commitment of Caan's new girl friend. There  are also good scenes showing the mixed feelings of some of the law  enforcement types torn between their battle with the mob, and their  sympathy for Caan's predicament, and the well played roll of a sympathetic  lawyer who tries to help Caan by working the legal angles. (There's also  one hilarious ""violent"" scene here in which nobody gets hurt, but left me  rolling on the floor.)The third and shortest part of the movie is a  race; a race between Caan, the mob and the government.  Caan is racing to  recover his kids after he has located them, the mob is trying to kill the  missing witness as an act of revenge that could well end up hurting the  kids, and government are trying to arrive in time to set things more or  less right.I loved it.
