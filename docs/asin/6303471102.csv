To this day I still have the VHS tape & still use it today to work out to.  If it ever break's I'm buying it on dvd to use.  When my dad started usuing this to excerise he lost about 30 or 40 pounds back then and I lost some weight from excerising to this to.  So I can defently say that this VHS tape defently work's for losing weight and is the best method I've seen out anywhere.Get this VHS tape or if your lucky buy it on dvd then you'll know it will last longer.By th eway the only reason why I didn't review this earlier was because I didn't know amazon sold this.Happy Hunting for Excerise Videos!,5,Sweatin to oldies 3 an aerobic concert with Richard Simmon's:  Best method of working out so.,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,888,"['Hello', ""'m"", 'autistic', 'adult.This', 'Review', 'Sweatin', 'Oldies', '3', 'Aerobic', 'Concert', 'VHS.My', 'dad', 'got', 'originally', 'own', 'personal', 'use', 'lose', 'weight', 'back', 'early', '1990', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'use', 'excerise', 'dad', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'day', 'still', 'have', 'VHS', 'tape', 'still', 'use', 'today', 'work', 'out', 'ever', 'break', ""'m"", 'buying', 'dvd', 'use', 'When', 'dad', 'started', 'usuing', 'excerise', 'lost', 'about', '30', '40', 'pounds', 'back', 'then', 'lost', 'weight', 'excerising', 'can', 'defently', 'say', 'VHS', 'tape', 'defently', 'work', 'losing', 'weight', 'best', 'method', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'out', 'VHS', 'tape', 'lucky', 'buy', 'dvd', 'then', ""'ll"", 'know', 'will', 'last', 'longer.By', 'th', 'eway', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'review', 'earlier', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'amazon', 'sold', 'this.Happy', 'Hunting', 'Excerise', 'Videos']",Sweatin' to the Oldies 3:  An Aerobic Concert with Richard Simmons VHS

Beginners and Intermediates will find a lot to love in this tape: great  music, fun routines, lots of inspiration. This video has the sexiest moves  of any of his tapes, so I'd recommend staying away from it if you're  offended by that kind of thing. This one is fun, long, and not as easy as  it looks. But there are plenty of people to watch as examples of how to  either tone down the routine or jazz it up. The setting is like a carnival,  and the routine has as much energy as a carnival ride.

My appreciation for Richard Simmons began when I was a young child. My mom loves him and when the original Sweatin to the oldies came about, she and her sisters passed it around. I always ended up ""sweatin"" along with my mom whenever she'd do it, but not to lose weight, just to have fun. Finally in junior high I began to realize I needed to make a serious change and I began doing Richard's tapes almost every night. Midway thru highschool, I had dropped almost 60 pounds and I credit him with a lot of my success. This specific video is tops. I don't like ""Sweatin"" 2 very much for whatever reason and the first one got old a long time ago, but somehow it stands that this one is a keeper for me.  My favorite ditty is ""I get around""...it's actually surprisingly vigorous for Richard! Because these videos aren't overloaded with tough moves, it's easier to do them daily, which to me is the healhiest idea. Light-moderate exercise each day until the weight comes off!

Not only is Richard Simmons and inspiration to all of us that need to lose a few pounds, he really can get his groove thang on!  The music is totally contagious and the workout is great.  It isn't too hard but it also isn't too easy.  You really do get your heart pumping with this tape.  Plus you get to sing along with the music. The only ting Richard doesn't explain is the heart rate and what your target should be.  Perhaps it is in the other tapes, but if you only own this one, check into what your target heart rate should be.
