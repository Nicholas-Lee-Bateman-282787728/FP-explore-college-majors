The CBS show also included Robert Lansing (""Gary Seven"" of the Star Trek episode ""Assignment: Earth"") as the source of many of McCall's assignments. Lansing's character, ""Control"", worked for The Company, which used to employee McCall as an operative. Another operative, played by The King of Queen's Jerry Stiller (father of Ben Stiller), gave McCall the nickname ""The Equalizer"" in the opening episode.Other first-season guest stars beside Jerry Stiller included Lauren Tom, David Alan Grier, Lori Petty (in her first role), Adam Ant, Luis Guzm&aacute;n, Burt Young, Dana Barron, Bradley Whitford, Christine Baranski, Alex Winter, Charles S. Dutton, Meat Loaf, Mark Linn-Baker, Tovah Feldshuh, Ray Sharkey, Marisa Berenson, Brad Dourif, Jasmine Guy, James Eckhouse, David Leisure, Robert Davi, Melissa Joan Hart, Kim Delaney, Patricia Clarkson, Dann Florek, Tony Shalhoub, Laurie Metcalf, Dan Hedaya, and probably a lot of others that we missed. Whew!This morning Universal Studios Home Entertainment officially announced that you'll be able to get all 22 first-year episodes on 5 DVDs when they release The Equalizer - Season 1. This long-awaited set, in high demand with registered members of this site, will finally see the light of day on February 12th. Episodes will be shown in their original full-screen video format, and with English Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. There will also be English Subtitles available for the hearing impaired. Cost will be $49.98 SRP. We don't have cover art yet, but stay tuned and we'll bring that to you just as soon as we get it!",4,On DVD 2-12-08.,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,1908,"['tvshowsondvd.comThe', 'Equalizer', 'Wait', 'Universal', 'Announces', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Finally', 'Assignment', 'February', '12thPosted', 'David', 'Lambert10/30/2007Previously', 'best', 'known', 'title', 'character', '1980', 'film', ""'Breaker"", 'Morant', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'literally', 'blew', 'American', 'TV', 'audiences', 'away', '1985', 'Robert', 'McCall', 'Equalizer', 'CBS', 'show', 'also', 'included', 'Robert', 'Lansing', 'Gary', 'Seven', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Assignment', 'Earth', 'source', 'many', 'McCall', 'assignments', 'Lansing', 'character', 'Control', 'worked', 'Company', 'used', 'employee', 'McCall', 'operative', 'operative', 'played', 'King', 'Queen', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'father', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'gave', 'McCall', 'nickname', 'Equalizer', 'opening', 'episode.Other', 'first-season', 'guest', 'stars', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'included', 'Lauren', 'Tom', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'first', 'role', 'Adam', 'Ant', 'Luis', 'Guzm', 'aacute', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Dana', 'Barron', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'Alex', 'Winter', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'Mark', 'Linn-Baker', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', 'Marisa', 'Berenson', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Jasmine', 'Guy', 'James', 'Eckhouse', 'David', 'Leisure', 'Robert', 'Davi', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'Kim', 'Delaney', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Dann', 'Florek', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'probably', 'lot', 'others', 'missed', 'Whew', 'morning', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'officially', 'announced', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'get', '22', 'first-year', 'episodes', '5', 'DVDs', 'when', 'release', 'Equalizer', 'Season', '1', 'long-awaited', 'set', 'high', 'demand', 'registered', 'members', 'site', 'will', 'finally', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'February', '12th', 'Episodes', 'will', 'be', 'shown', 'original', 'full-screen', 'video', 'format', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'audio', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'available', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'Cost', 'will', 'be', '49.98', 'SRP', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cover', 'art', 'yet', 'stay', 'tuned', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'get']",N/A

""Miami Vice"" had glitz, glamor, was well written; but because of the time period--the fashions, the hairstyles, and the topics--now seems dated.  This series seemed to be able to capture the smarts and grittiness of New York, and the gray areas of the intelligence field; and it seems timeless.  James McAdams created a wonderful character in Robert McCall, and lucked into a wonderful actor to play McCall--for those who don't know the story, McAdams originally created the series as a vehicle for James Coburn, but Coburn's longtime problems with arthritis wouldn't let him take the role.  So McAdams had to find someone else to fill the McCall role.  The whole upshoot was that Edward Woodward didn't just play the world-weary ex-spy turned private investigator, he BECAME Robert McCall.This two-parter delved into McCall's past; a lost love who he worked with in his previous life, and discovering a daughter that Manon didn't let him know he had.  Woodward was brilliant in this episode as was Anthony Zerbe as the man Manon married and treated Yvette as his own.  Melissa Sue Anderson was very good as Yvette, and Keith Szarabajka was consistenly solid as McCall's occasional partner (both within the Company and in McCall's private enterprise) Mickey Kostmayer.  This was a story that allowed the viewer into the past of Robert McCall; reminding him of some regrets, of choices made and paths taken.  The action is tense, but the drama is sad and remorseful.It seems odd that ""Miami Vice"" will be done as a feature length film this summer.  I worry about it having a dated feel.  ""The Equalizer"" seemed capable of telling much more timeless stories, with this two-parter being a good example.",5,"Oh, was THIS good...",1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,1760,"['Equalizer', 'was', 'thinking', 'man', 'television', '1980s', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'had', 'glitz', 'glamor', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'time', 'period', 'fashions', 'hairstyles', 'topics', 'now', 'dated', 'series', 'seemed', 'be', 'able', 'capture', 'smarts', 'grittiness', 'New', 'York', 'gray', 'areas', 'intelligence', 'field', 'timeless', 'James', 'McAdams', 'created', 'wonderful', 'character', 'Robert', 'McCall', 'lucked', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'play', 'McCall', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'McAdams', 'originally', 'created', 'series', 'vehicle', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Coburn', 'longtime', 'problems', 'arthritis', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'take', 'role', 'So', 'McAdams', 'had', 'find', 'someone', 'else', 'fill', 'McCall', 'role', 'whole', 'upshoot', 'was', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'play', 'world-weary', 'ex-spy', 'turned', 'private', 'investigator', 'BECAME', 'Robert', 'McCall.This', 'two-parter', 'delved', 'McCall', 'past', 'lost', 'love', 'who', 'worked', 'previous', 'life', 'discovering', 'daughter', 'Manon', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'know', 'had', 'Woodward', 'was', 'brilliant', 'episode', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'man', 'Manon', 'married', 'treated', 'Yvette', 'own', 'Melissa', 'Sue', 'Anderson', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Yvette', 'Keith', 'Szarabajka', 'was', 'consistenly', 'solid', 'McCall', 'occasional', 'partner', 'Company', 'McCall', 'private', 'enterprise', 'Mickey', 'Kostmayer', 'was', 'story', 'allowed', 'viewer', 'past', 'Robert', 'McCall', 'reminding', 'regrets', 'choices', 'made', 'paths', 'taken', 'action', 'tense', 'drama', 'sad', 'remorseful.It', 'odd', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'summer', 'worry', 'having', 'dated', 'feel', 'Equalizer', 'seemed', 'capable', 'telling', 'much', 'more', 'timeless', 'stories', 'two-parter', 'being', 'good', 'example']",N/A
