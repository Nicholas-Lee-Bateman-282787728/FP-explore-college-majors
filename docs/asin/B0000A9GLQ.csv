Collier ""Shelf-Help""","[43, 45]","I can still remember about 25 years ago throwing a huge temper tantrum, slamming my tiny hands hard against 70s-ish, tacky-looking, artificial wooden walls.  My outrage: I missed an episode of ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"".  And yet it was certainly not the response that would have pleased my idol.Now I look back and smile, not only because it's a little funny, but also because after many years of being ""grown up"" and asserting my ""maturity"", I am once again on the Mister Rogers bandwagon, perhaps even more so than when I was a child.No doubt, it began in 1998 when I read Tom Junod's extensive (but worthwhile) article about him in the November issue of ""Esquire"".  But this DVD has now put the icing on an already delicious cake.  My only wish is that there could have been an interview with Tom Junod, the writer who was at least partly responsible for re-introducing Mister Rogers to the current pop culture.Mister Rogers was the word gentleness made flesh.  He was kind not only in front of the cameras, but even in his own private life.  He was in fact the real deal!  He was genuine with everyone regardless of age, economic position, or power.  He talked to congressmen, co-workers, Joan Rivers, small children, and you and me all alike.  He displayed a gentleness and genuiness that our world is not at all comfortable with and yet in dire need of, never more so than today.I highly recommend this DVD to everyone.  Even if you hated the man (it's hard to believe, but there are such people out there), or you're a skeptic, or a mocker.  Mister Rogers could tame even the toughest audience, and if you're up to the challenge, you can see him do it over and over on this DVD.  And lastly, I recommend this DVD to anyone who is just aching to see something decent on their television screen.God blessed us.",5,I like you too,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,1819,"['can', 'still', 'remember', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'throwing', 'huge', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'slamming', 'tiny', 'hands', 'hard', '70s-ish', 'tacky-looking', 'artificial', 'wooden', 'walls', 'outrage', 'missed', 'episode', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'Neighborhood', 'yet', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'response', 'would', 'have', 'pleased', 'idol.Now', 'look', 'back', 'smile', 'not', 'only', 'little', 'funny', 'also', 'many', 'years', 'being', 'grown', 'up', 'asserting', 'maturity', 'am', 'once', 'again', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'bandwagon', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'child.No', 'doubt', 'began', '1998', 'when', 'read', 'Tom', 'Junod', 'extensive', 'worthwhile', 'article', 'November', 'issue', 'Esquire', 'DVD', 'now', 'put', 'icing', 'already', 'delicious', 'cake', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interview', 'Tom', 'Junod', 'writer', 'who', 'was', 'least', 'partly', 'responsible', 're-introducing', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'current', 'pop', 'culture.Mister', 'Rogers', 'was', 'word', 'gentleness', 'made', 'flesh', 'was', 'kind', 'not', 'only', 'front', 'cameras', 'even', 'own', 'private', 'life', 'was', 'fact', 'real', 'deal', 'was', 'genuine', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'age', 'economic', 'position', 'power', 'talked', 'congressmen', 'co-workers', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'small', 'children', 'alike', 'displayed', 'gentleness', 'genuiness', 'world', 'not', 'comfortable', 'yet', 'dire', 'need', 'never', 'more', 'so', 'today.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'Even', 'hated', 'man', 'hard', 'believe', 'are', 'such', 'people', 'there', ""'re"", 'skeptic', 'mocker', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'could', 'tame', 'even', 'toughest', 'audience', ""'re"", 'up', 'challenge', 'can', 'see', 'do', 'over', 'DVD', 'lastly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'aching', 'see', 'something', 'decent', 'television', 'screen.God', 'blessed']",N/A

Rogers.This wonderful documentary chronicles his life from infancy to his untimely death in 2003. The documentary is also narrated and hosted by former ""Neighborhood"" crew member, Michael Keaton.We see Fred's transition from floor manager at NBC, to finally having his own show on WQED out of Pittsburgh. Mr. Rogers truly was a neighbor to us all, and this DVD is a testament to his influence on our culture.

762104,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0000A9GLQ,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[35, 37]","Unlike so many people with a religious background, Mister Rogers never threw his own religion around. Instead, he wanted kids (and adults) to always like themselves the way they are.Mister Rogers knew that more could be accomplished in the world if people were emotionally/mentally built up instead of being told that they were not any good. This timeless lesson (along with his naturally caring personality) was what made Mister Rogers Neighborhood such a wildly popular show on PBS. According to the official program record, it was PBS's longest running show.Even when Sesame Street and other PBS shows were trying to go for 'current' Mister Rogers refused to talk down to his audience. He was also radical in believing that children deserved respect and needed to be listened to.Sure, Picture Picture went from filmstrips to videocassettes, but that was a technical change so Mr. Rogers could continue his show. A technical change was acceptable because it had not altered the time-honored formula established in the very first show.This documentary is good for Mister Rogers Neighborhood fans, but it is also a good teaching tool. People wanting to go into broadcast production and/or early childhood education must be made aware of the critical difference between good material, the mediocre, and the absolutely horrible.",5,A real saint,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,1326,"['so', 'many', 'people', 'religious', 'background', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'never', 'threw', 'own', 'religion', 'around', 'Instead', 'wanted', 'kids', 'adults', 'always', 'like', 'way', 'are.Mister', 'Rogers', 'knew', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'accomplished', 'world', 'people', 'were', 'emotionally/mentally', 'built', 'up', 'instead', 'being', 'told', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'timeless', 'lesson', 'naturally', 'caring', 'personality', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'Neighborhood', 'wildly', 'popular', 'show', 'PBS', 'According', 'official', 'program', 'record', 'was', 'PBS', 'longest', 'running', 'show.Even', 'when', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'other', 'PBS', 'shows', 'were', 'trying', 'go', ""'current"", 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'refused', 'talk', 'down', 'audience', 'was', 'also', 'radical', 'believing', 'children', 'deserved', 'respect', 'needed', 'be', 'listened', 'to.Sure', 'Picture', 'Picture', 'went', 'filmstrips', 'videocassettes', 'was', 'technical', 'change', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'could', 'continue', 'show', 'technical', 'change', 'was', 'acceptable', 'had', 'not', 'altered', 'time-honored', 'formula', 'established', 'very', 'first', 'show.This', 'documentary', 'good', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'Neighborhood', 'fans', 'also', 'good', 'teaching', 'tool', 'People', 'wanting', 'go', 'broadcast', 'production', 'and/or', 'early', 'childhood', 'education', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'aware', 'critical', 'difference', 'good', 'material', 'mediocre', 'absolutely', 'horrible']",N/A

762106,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B0000A9GLQ,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","So often our public heroes wind up having feet of clay ... but Fred Rogers was exactly the man that generations of children saw & loved on TV . This fine documentary not only gives us a look at the man himself, and the influences that shaped him, but also the many ways that he helped to shape the lives of others. Clearly intelligent & passionate about his work, what comes through most of all is his innate decency. The viewer never gets the sense that he's simply playing a part for TV, even away from the set of his show. No, you immediately know that this is the real man.The documentary is valuable not only for providing its overview of & insights into Fred Rogers, but for the extras included on the DVD. While excerpts of various appearances are used in the main documentary, the complete appearances themselves are also provided. It's fascinating to see an early black-&-white TV profile of the man from beginning to end, both so that we can see everything for ourselves, and as an example of a time when TV profiles were simpler but had much more substance. There's no intrusive, mawkish music that occasionally overwhelms the dialogue, as with so many modern TV shows. And there are no quick cuts & jittery editing, either -- the profile simple lets the man talk at length. It's a real pleasure!Interestingly enough, it's the adults who'll get the most out of this documentary. It offers a strong model of manhood that I wish many more would follow: no false bravado to conceal massive insecurities,  no crudeness or nastiness, but just a good man doing his best to live a worthwhile, giving life & leave the world a better place. Frankly, I don't see how anyone can improve on that.
