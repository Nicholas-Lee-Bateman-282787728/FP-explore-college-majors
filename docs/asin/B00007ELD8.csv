727353,A28KL4VGU24MWS,B00007ELD8,Lorrie,"[2, 2]","The movie one week was co-written and starring Kenny Young and it is a powerful tale of how stereotypes existed (and still exist) within the world about who is most likely to contract an STD.  The movie is not the best-written script ever, and it's not the, considering the entire cast as a whole, best acting ever, but as also as a whole, the way the plot is delivered along with the fact that the story-line and and the main character are sympathetic, make you realize this is a movie you may never forget.This story begins with a man who is on the cusp of realizing his dream, he has been at his job years, has a fiance who loves him, and her family has welcomed him with open arms, so he now has the family he always dreamed of as kid as he moved from place to place.Varon grew up in the foster-care system due to parents who were heroin-addicts, but when you meet him, this fact is not at first, evident or even known.  But, as the story unfolds, you learn that he has made a few mistakes, and is struggling to get his life toward that positive ending of a family, that he always dreamed of while watching the Cosby Show as a kid. Saadiqa Muhammad's strong acting as his fiance helps you see the pain that news like finding out that the man you love, and were less than 36 hours away from marrying potentially could be carrying an STD that can cause a much more deadly disease.  The story line progresses as Varon deals with the knowledge that the person who exposed him to HIV set out to deliberately expose him and all the men she came in contact with and even his best friend got exposed. The worst of it is that his best friend, who is also his roommate finds out he contracted HIV and, unable to deal with it all, ends his life with bullet to the head.  He ends up without a job, a best friend, and his fiance, who'd just discovered she was pregnant, cannot trust him due to some deceptions on his part earlier in their relationship, besides the fact that he may have unwittingly exposed her to HIV.This is a lot to deal with for anyone, but how this former foster care child deals with, shows the man he has become and shows that we are a lot stronger than we seem.  Varon, who at the beginning of the movie had a life with so much hope and promise and was seeming to finally realize his dreams, now has to re-evaluate what matters to him most and where his life is going and what is he going to do with his future.At the end, we see he and his wife have worked on things and he is attending university of chicago.  This is such a wonderful story.***seen on netflix",5,It Could Happen to Anyone..so never say never.,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,2576,"['movie', 'one', 'week', 'was', 'co-written', 'starring', 'Kenny', 'Young', 'powerful', 'tale', 'how', 'stereotypes', 'existed', 'still', 'exist', 'world', 'who', 'most', 'likely', 'contract', 'STD', 'movie', 'not', 'best-written', 'script', 'ever', 'not', 'considering', 'entire', 'cast', 'whole', 'best', 'acting', 'ever', 'as', 'also', 'whole', 'way', 'plot', 'delivered', 'fact', 'story-line', 'main', 'character', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'make', 'realize', 'movie', 'may', 'never', 'forget.This', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'cusp', 'realizing', 'dream', 'been', 'job', 'years', 'fiance', 'who', 'family', 'welcomed', 'open', 'arms', 'now', 'family', 'always', 'dreamed', 'as', 'kid', 'moved', 'place', 'place.Varon', 'grew', 'up', 'foster-care', 'system', 'due', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'heroin-addicts', 'when', 'meet', 'fact', 'not', 'first', 'evident', 'even', 'known', 'story', 'unfolds', 'learn', 'made', 'few', 'mistakes', 'struggling', 'get', 'life', 'positive', 'ending', 'family', 'always', 'dreamed', 'watching', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'kid', 'Saadiqa', 'Muhammad', 'strong', 'acting', 'fiance', 'see', 'pain', 'news', 'finding', 'out', 'man', 'love', 'were', 'less', '36', 'hours', 'away', 'marrying', 'potentially', 'could', 'be', 'carrying', 'STD', 'can', 'cause', 'much', 'more', 'deadly', 'disease', 'story', 'line', 'Varon', 'deals', 'knowledge', 'person', 'who', 'exposed', 'HIV', 'set', 'out', 'deliberately', 'expose', 'men', 'came', 'contact', 'even', 'best', 'friend', 'got', 'exposed', 'worst', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'roommate', 'out', 'contracted', 'HIV', 'unable', 'deal', 'life', 'bullet', 'head', 'up', 'job', 'best', 'friend', 'fiance', 'who', ""'d"", 'just', 'discovered', 'was', 'pregnant', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'due', 'deceptions', 'part', 'earlier', 'relationship', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'unwittingly', 'exposed', 'HIV.This', 'lot', 'deal', 'anyone', 'how', 'former', 'foster', 'care', 'child', 'deals', 'man', 'become', 'are', 'lot', 'stronger', 'seem', 'Varon', 'who', 'beginning', 'movie', 'had', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'hope', 'promise', 'was', 'seeming', 'finally', 'realize', 'dreams', 'now', 're-evaluate', 'what', 'matters', 'most', 'where', 'life', 'going', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'future.At', 'end', 'see', 'wife', 'have', 'worked', 'things', 'attending', 'university', 'chicago', 'such', 'wonderful', 'story', '***seen', 'netflix']",One Week
