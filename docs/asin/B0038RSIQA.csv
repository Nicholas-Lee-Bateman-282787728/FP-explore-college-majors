GET OUT OF THEM! First off, this movie must have been shot with a thousand dollar salary and a DV cam by someone who cant hold still long enough to shoot a decent shot. The opening ""scene"" gave me motion sickness. Holy crap! Terrible opening scene, shouldve cut it out. Second off, the Chick playing his ""doctor"" is playing more of a woman on a uninteresting blind date then anyone that would resemble ""a doctor."" Epic Fail. Bad acting, bad directing, scripted fight scenes, this movie must have been rushed. This was just some sort of bag of doo doo to sell to people who are fans of Stone Cold.

1333182,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B0038RSIQA,D.P.,"[2, 3]","Steve Austin's third starring role has him as a former F.B.I. agent who had gone rouge & is now hunted by not only the F.B.I. but also the Russian mob due to him being involved with a top-secret investigation that revolved around an internal mole & a hidden amount of money...with him having no clue why due to him having his memory blocked past a few quick unclear flashes of various things like a little girl & a briefcase.  The main people looking for him is his psychologist Grace (played by Erica Cerra) who attempts to help figure out what is blocked from his memory & F.B.I. agent Mason Reese (played by Adam Beech) who has a past with both characters & has his own motives for helping restore his memory.Just like how Austin's previous movie in ""The Condenmed"" had elements of it's script heavily taken from a previous successful movie in ""The Running Man"", that's the same case here as this movie had elements very similar to those of the Bourne trilogy.  This is trying to be sold as an action movie but most of the action (which is limited to a few chase scenes) takes a backstage to a heavy amount of dialog & storytelling which is a heavy disappointment as it just didn't balance well unlike Austin's previous two films.  The production was pretty much what you would expect from a low-budget ""straight to home video"" film but it got annoying with the heavy amount of on & off flashbacks throughout the film.  The ending kept the door open for a sequel & in the end, this movie just came off more as a 88 minute background story strictly to setup the future sequels which made this movie easily forgettable once I finished watching it...to the point where if you notice, I don't even mention the name of Austin's character but I don't remember it.

1333185,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B0038RSIQA,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 1]",The Stranger released in 2010. Directed by Robert Liberman the only thing of not he directed was Mighty Ducks 3 & we all know that's an awesome sequel (yeah) it stars Steve Austin as The Stranger he hasn't had much luck with action movies. It also stars Adam Beach as Reese & Erica Cerra as Grace.This is like any other direct to video movie & I'll try to tell the plot the best I can cause this movie is forgettable. Austin has amnesia which is always a bad plot point. The opening is bad  Austin is being chased by F  B  I SWAT guys who can't shoot for s  h  i  t. You have a bad song playing. You have this Psychiatrist Grace who wants to help him & her delivery is so wooden she reminds me of Rooney Mara. Austin has a problem where he thinks he's different people & so he takes ill  legals over the border & he's pulled over by some Mexican Cops & the 1 decent scene is where he is being tortured & he escapes. Grace has a map with pins in it with each spot where Austin has been spotted. Also an agent named Mason Reese turns out to be the guy who put a bomb in the car that Austin's wife & kid were in. So they ripped off the 1989 Punisher. You have a lot of these annoying flashy cuts. Austin took money from Agent Reese then we go to the finish Austin is tied up in some factory he gets most of his memory back & Adam Beach goes down like a p  u  ss  y. I didn't do good job explaining the plot but it's forgettable. It's like they ripped off The Bourne movies which I don't care for but there better than this movie &  they ripped off Punisher 89 & put it in any other direct to video movie. I agree with 1 reviewer trebe it is a tale about memory loss that takes too long to tell. Steve Austin does what he can. Adam Beach was a bad as the villain. Erica Cerra is wooden.

1333186,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,B0038RSIQA,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[5, 6]","If you read the DVD jacket or product description, it says that Austin is an amnesiac who'se being hunted by both the FBI and the Russian Mafia.  Sounds like fun, no?  Well, if you are a Steve Austin fan, then you'll probably enjoy this film.  If you're not an Austin fan, you'll probably find it a somewhat forgettable (pun intended) action flick.  One of the more interesting parts is the DVD jacket-perhaps playing to the new 3-D craze, the cardboard cover has an interesting 3-D effect to it.  But that's as high-tech as this film goes.  Right at the very start of the film, when Austin (looking like a real street person, with beard & long hair) is being chased by cops shooting automatic rifles at him, for an impossibly long chase sequence and never once hitting him, you realize that credibility is not going to be the film's strong suit.  Not only must they be the world's worst shots (chimpanzees firing automatics would have hit him in this sequence) but the premise for why they would be shooting to kill doesn't really exist either.  The film seems to be striving for more than just action-film cred...there's a fair amount of dialog here, and it seems like Austin is trying to establish acting ability, not just muscle memory.  Unfortunately the script, the directing, and the cinematography, all are working against him.  As mentioned before, some of the action sequences are filmed in really low-budget, low-quality fashion like from a first-try home movie stuck up on YouTube.  Also much of the ""plot"" involves showing the same flashbacks from Austin's confused memory, over and over and over again--once, twice, three, four, five, you lose track how many times you see the same images.  Each time a little more detail-but it's like torturing the audience in its cumulative effect.  Erica Cerra plays a (beautiful, female) psychologist trying to help him remember his past. [A little skin here wouldn't have hurt this film--but Noooo] And then we have the good and the bad FBI agents.  Though the jacket touts a prominent role for the Russian Mafia, they are barely in evidence in the body of the film, so they never really seem like a credible threat.  Mexican dealers and police have a slightly bigger role--but really the main stage here is Austin's own memory, his relationship with the psychologist, and with the FBI (he was an agent).  Yes, the end allows for a sequel. No, I don't know that the film will generate enough interest to spawn one.  If Austin had a role in a higher-budget, Hollywood-type movie, he just might be as credible as Dwayne ""The Rock"" has become.",3,Is it a Forgettable Movie?,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,2593,"['read', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'product', 'description', 'Austin', 'amnesiac', ""who'se"", 'being', 'hunted', 'FBI', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'fun', 'Well', 'are', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'fan', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'Austin', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'somewhat', 'forgettable', 'pun', 'intended', 'action', 'flick', 'One', 'more', 'interesting', 'parts', 'DVD', 'jacket-perhaps', 'playing', 'new', '3-D', 'craze', 'cardboard', 'cover', 'interesting', '3-D', 'effect', 'as', 'high-tech', 'film', 'Right', 'very', 'start', 'film', 'when', 'Austin', 'looking', 'real', 'street', 'person', 'beard', 'long', 'hair', 'being', 'chased', 'cops', 'shooting', 'automatic', 'rifles', 'impossibly', 'long', 'chase', 'sequence', 'never', 'once', 'hitting', 'realize', 'credibility', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'strong', 'suit', 'Not', 'only', 'must', 'be', 'world', 'worst', 'shots', 'chimpanzees', 'firing', 'automatics', 'would', 'have', 'hit', 'sequence', 'premise', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'shooting', 'kill', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'either', 'film', 'be', 'striving', 'more', 'just', 'action-film', 'cred', 'fair', 'amount', 'dialog', 'here', 'Austin', 'trying', 'establish', 'acting', 'ability', 'not', 'just', 'muscle', 'memory', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'are', 'working', 'mentioned', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'filmed', 'really', 'low-budget', 'low-quality', 'fashion', 'first-try', 'home', 'movie', 'stuck', 'up', 'YouTube', 'Also', 'much', 'plot', 'showing', 'same', 'flashbacks', 'Austin', 'confused', 'memory', 'over', 'again', 'once', 'twice', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'lose', 'track', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'same', 'images', 'time', 'little', 'more', 'detail-but', 'torturing', 'audience', 'cumulative', 'effect', 'Erica', 'Cerra', 'beautiful', 'female', 'psychologist', 'trying', 'help', 'remember', 'past', '[', 'little', 'skin', 'here', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt', 'film', 'Noooo', ']', 'then', 'have', 'good', 'bad', 'FBI', 'agents', 'jacket', 'prominent', 'role', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'are', 'barely', 'evidence', 'body', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'seem', 'credible', 'threat', 'Mexican', 'dealers', 'police', 'have', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'role', 'really', 'main', 'stage', 'here', 'Austin', 'own', 'memory', 'relationship', 'psychologist', 'FBI', 'was', 'agent', 'Yes', 'end', 'sequel', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'will', 'generate', 'enough', 'interest', 'spawn', 'one', 'Austin', 'had', 'role', 'higher-budget', 'Hollywood-type', 'movie', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'as', 'credible', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'become']",The Stranger

Well, that's what happened with me and ""The Stranger"", featuring Stone Cold Steve Austin.  I CAN watch a low budget movie.  I'm not some High Def nerd, who can't fathom watching a movie that's not spectacular in special effects or production.  I'm into ANY movie that tells a great story, and the actors do a good job doing so.  Well, in this movie, none of the things that go into making a movie special are present.The acting is HORRIFIC, the storyline is so predictable.  I mean, really?  Another movie where a bad-ass, machine of a man loses his memory, and has no idea who he is?  Haven't we seen this type of movie too often already?  How about for Austin's next movie, we burn his face, but a glove on him, and have him enter people's dreams?  I don't think that's been done enough already either.Austin's work in The Condemned was tolerable.  It was actually a pretty decent movie.  Other than that, everything I've seen him in has been forgettable to awful.  I suppose that's why you won't see him starring in a Major Motion Picture.

Steve Austin plays that same guy from those kinda movies, an FBI agent who is through to have gone rouge, but it's really because he just has no idea who he is, while all this other boring stuff is going on inside the FBI. Sound familiar enough for you to decide to skip seeing this?Ok, how about this then... the camera work in this movie is sickening. It's one of those nauseating 'hand held' feel movies where the camera keeps shaking around... whatever idiot came up with that has got to wish he had amnesia so he can't recall ever having to see such poor image quality presented for a movie. And lets not forget the development... what is with these movie makers insisting on drowning out color and making everything look stale? It looked horrible years ago in Superman Returns, what makes them think it would look any better now?The editing is also pretty poor. Between the overly long intro/title sequence, and the annoying music chosen to be played over it, it makes it unforgivable later in the film when scenes keep switching back and forth between the main characters memories as he slowly remembers things... which was done very poorly.

1333190,A2FSEGZDAONS2U,B0038RSIQA,Movie Madman,"[10, 12]","Steve Austin plays a guy who has forgotten who he is, but he proves to be no Bourne. The fight scenes are short and not at all creative or cool. It is explained in the special features they were rushed for time and had to basically choreagraph the fight scenes on the spot. Trust me, it showed. When you rent or buy a movie with Steve Austin, you want to see fighting and butt kicking.Parts of the movie went to what appeared to be a home video look. Very low budget on this one. Austin gets shot at for long stretches of the movie and unrealistically never gets hit until he eventually gets grazed a little. He seemed a little stiff and unnatural during his movements throughout the movie. Firing a machine gun or tossing a grenade didn't look second nature for him. He looked rehearsed and nervous.Austin would be good in a horror movie where he is in a group in peril and has to be the hero. That would be his perfect role. These loner, bad guy-type roles aren't working for him. He doesn't have the Dolph Lundgren or Van Dam charisma to engage an audience...at least not in this movie. He does have charisma, wrestling fans who have seen him know this for a fact. He just needs cool lines and memorable action scenes.His toughest guys he fought in the movie was an elderly fisherman and an overweight mexican police officer. Where was the tough antagonist who we thought might stomp Austin in a fight, but we wanted to see him fight and get the big battle at the end...none of that here. No cool bad guys, no cool fights, no cool lines. In the end, it was not a fun experience.Austin fans can skip this one and action fans should definitely keep walking.

The violence is brutal and unremitting, the dialog and acting laughable (except when it's meant to be funny) with the production in severe need of a good pruning, as the limited plot and storyline is stretched ever more thinly (and the flashbacks repeated ever more frequently) as it heads towards a denouement that is obvious from the outset.There is one one good performance and that is from Erica Cerra, who does at least manage to add a dimension or two to her character, although even she struggles at time with some of the sillier plot developments.None of this will come as a surprise to anyone, of course, so if you're on the look-out for 90 minutes of mindless savagery, which requires no thought processes whatsoever to be engaged, this should do you just fine.",2,"Bloody, mindless mayhem",1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,1459,"['Former', 'pro-wrestler', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'contribution', 'violent', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'Robert', 'Lieberman', 'direct-to-video', 'action', 'thriller', 'offering', 'Stranger', 'Austin', 'amnesiac', 'drop-out', 'run', 'Russian', 'mob', 'FBI', 'reason', 'can', 'remember', 'Erica', 'Cerra', 'role', 'clinical', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr', 'Grace', 'Bishop', 'sifting', 'mayhem', 'left', 'wake', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'what', 'so', 'determined', 'not', 'remember.Shot', 'mostly', 'hand-held', 'video', 'camera', 'edited', 'way', 'probably', 'intended', 'come', 'raw', 'punchy', 'instead', 'budget', 'amateurish', 'violence', 'brutal', 'unremitting', 'dialog', 'acting', 'laughable', 'when', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'production', 'severe', 'need', 'good', 'pruning', 'limited', 'plot', 'storyline', 'stretched', 'ever', 'more', 'thinly', 'flashbacks', 'repeated', 'ever', 'more', 'frequently', 'denouement', 'obvious', 'outset.There', 'one', 'one', 'good', 'performance', 'Erica', 'Cerra', 'who', 'least', 'manage', 'add', 'dimension', 'two', 'character', 'even', 'time', 'sillier', 'plot', 'developments.None', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'course', 'so', ""'re"", 'look-out', '90', 'minutes', 'mindless', 'savagery', 'thought', 'whatsoever', 'be', 'engaged', 'should', 'do', 'just', 'fine']",The Stranger

1333197,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0038RSIQA,trebe,"[2, 2]","The Stranger (2010) features Steve Austin as a man who has forgotten his past, being chased by the FBI because they believe he has knowledge about a mole in the agency.  His true identity and what he has done, remains mostly a mystery until the end.  However by then you may be worn out by the long drawn out style of storytelling that features too many repetitive flashbacks of the same scenes.  When the pieces are finally revealed, the payoff just doesn't live up to the big build up, and hardly seems worth the wait.The stranger, apparently named Tom Tomashevsky (Austin), was an FBI agent on assignment infiltrating a Russian mob.  Something traumatic happened, and now he continuously forgets who he is.  Having escaped from FBI custody, he is reportedly in the vicinity of Coos Bay, Oregon.  Grace Bishop (Erica Cerra) a professor at Washington State University, who was involved in questioning Tom, has such great interest in his case that she goes and tries to find him.  FBI agent Mason Reese (Adam Beach) leads the team searching for Tom, and hoping that he will regain his memory and lead him to the FBI mole, he helps Tom and Grace evade capture.  Tom remains unstable, and it's not long before he takes off with Grace trying to escape, but the FBI soon takes them into custody again.While not totally uninteresting, the story is told in a way that makes it difficult to appreciate.  The aim may have been to preserve the mystery until the end, but the overuse of flashbacks really disrupts the flow of the movie.  We never really get to know much about Tom, and it's kind of hard to feel much sympathy for someone who is mostly dead emotionally.  Austin is not a polished actor, but he has screen presence, and he delivers his lines competently.  His strength is in the action and fighting departments, which he handles well enough.The Stranger is a watchable action vehicle, but the plot it doesn't flow very well or make much sense.  The final showdown with the mole, is rather underwhelming.  The film might be best suited to fans of Stone Cold Steve.  Austin's performance in The Condemned was probably more compelling, and would be recommended first to the casual fan.",2,a tale of memory loss that takes too long to tell...,1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,2187,"['Stranger', '2010', 'features', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'man', 'who', 'forgotten', 'past', 'being', 'chased', 'FBI', 'believe', 'knowledge', 'mole', 'agency', 'true', 'identity', 'what', 'done', 'mostly', 'mystery', 'end', 'However', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'worn', 'out', 'long', 'drawn', 'style', 'storytelling', 'features', 'too', 'many', 'repetitive', 'flashbacks', 'same', 'scenes', 'When', 'pieces', 'are', 'finally', 'revealed', 'payoff', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'big', 'build', 'up', 'hardly', 'wait.The', 'stranger', 'apparently', 'named', 'Tom', 'Tomashevsky', 'Austin', 'was', 'FBI', 'agent', 'assignment', 'infiltrating', 'Russian', 'mob', 'Something', 'traumatic', 'happened', 'now', 'continuously', 'who', 'Having', 'escaped', 'FBI', 'custody', 'reportedly', 'vicinity', 'Coos', 'Bay', 'Oregon', 'Grace', 'Bishop', 'Erica', 'Cerra', 'professor', 'Washington', 'State', 'University', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'questioning', 'Tom', 'such', 'great', 'interest', 'case', 'tries', 'find', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Mason', 'Reese', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'team', 'searching', 'Tom', 'hoping', 'will', 'regain', 'memory', 'lead', 'FBI', 'mole', 'Tom', 'Grace', 'evade', 'capture', 'Tom', 'unstable', 'not', 'long', 'Grace', 'trying', 'escape', 'FBI', 'soon', 'custody', 'not', 'totally', 'uninteresting', 'story', 'told', 'way', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'aim', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'preserve', 'mystery', 'end', 'overuse', 'flashbacks', 'really', 'flow', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'much', 'Tom', 'kind', 'hard', 'feel', 'much', 'sympathy', 'someone', 'who', 'mostly', 'dead', 'emotionally', 'Austin', 'not', 'polished', 'actor', 'screen', 'presence', 'lines', 'competently', 'strength', 'action', 'fighting', 'departments', 'well', 'enough.The', 'Stranger', 'watchable', 'action', 'vehicle', 'plot', ""n't"", 'flow', 'very', 'well', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'final', 'showdown', 'mole', 'rather', 'underwhelming', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'suited', 'fans', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'performance', 'Condemned', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'compelling', 'would', 'be', 'recommended', 'first', 'casual', 'fan']",The Stranger
