471978,A26KYDJOAGI05S,6305650713,Audiaa,"[49, 53]","There are some good workouts on this DVD and some that just don't work in ten minutes.  The toning sections (pilates, ballet, and yoga) are great, but the cardio sections (boot camp and kick boxing) are just too short.  This is a great DVD to try out different styles of exercise, and each section is simple enough for a beginner, but also challenging enough to keep doing.  Done together all five of these workouts do make a pretty good complete workout, but it's still short on cardio.Boot camp - try to cram in a cardio workout, weight training session, ab workout, and stretching into ten minutes, and you end up doing about one rep of each exercise.  This session is okay for a warm up to other exercise or as part of a complete workout using the entire DVDBallet - this session is fun.  It's all bar work using a chair.  Most of the harder moves are only done one time.  The music used for this session (similar to the music used for the rest of the sessions), is horrible.Kickboxing - This section is really too short for a cardio workout.  It's more like a warm up but it doesn't really have an adequate warm up.Pilates -  This session mostly abdominal exercises.  The moves are done pretty quickly and not as smoothly as other pilates tapes that I've seen, but it works.Yoga - I think the yoga section is great.  It's a little bit fast paced for traditional yoga, but it uses some of the most common moves.  It's slightly challenging, but definitely not too hard and is a great end to a workout especially at night.",4,Variety workout,1066608000,"10 20, 2003",2003,1524,"['are', 'good', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'ten', 'minutes', 'toning', 'sections', 'pilates', 'ballet', 'yoga', 'are', 'great', 'cardio', 'sections', 'boot', 'camp', 'kick', 'boxing', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'short', 'great', 'DVD', 'try', 'out', 'different', 'styles', 'exercise', 'section', 'simple', 'enough', 'beginner', 'also', 'challenging', 'enough', 'keep', 'doing', 'Done', 'together', 'five', 'workouts', 'do', 'make', 'pretty', 'good', 'complete', 'workout', 'still', 'short', 'cardio.Boot', 'camp', 'try', 'cram', 'cardio', 'workout', 'weight', 'training', 'session', 'ab', 'workout', 'stretching', 'ten', 'minutes', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'one', 'rep', 'exercise', 'session', 'okay', 'warm', 'up', 'other', 'exercise', 'part', 'complete', 'workout', 'using', 'entire', 'DVDBallet', 'session', 'fun', 'bar', 'work', 'using', 'chair', 'Most', 'harder', 'moves', 'are', 'only', 'done', 'one', 'time', 'music', 'used', 'session', 'similar', 'music', 'used', 'rest', 'sessions', 'horrible.Kickboxing', 'section', 'really', 'too', 'short', 'cardio', 'workout', 'more', 'warm', 'up', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'adequate', 'warm', 'session', 'mostly', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'moves', 'are', 'done', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'not', 'as', 'smoothly', 'other', 'pilates', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'works.Yoga', 'think', 'yoga', 'section', 'great', 'little', 'bit', 'fast', 'paced', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'most', 'common', 'moves', 'slightly', 'challenging', 'definitely', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'great', 'end', 'workout', 'especially', 'night']",10-Minute Solution - 10 Minute Workouts to Shape Your Whole Body VHS
471979,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,6305650713,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[3, 3]","10-Minute Solution consists of five complete 10-minute fitness programs, each showcasing a different exercise style.  The programs are designed either to stand alone or to be performed together when time permits; you can customize the workout that's right for you.  Instructor Michelle Nevidomsky Dozois is enthusiastic and motivating, and she provides good instruction for each workout style.The video begins with Boot Camp, a mix of classic toning exercises and short, low-impact cardio intervals.  You will do lunges, bicep curls (with dumbells), tricep dips (with a chair), and push-ups for a good, full body workout.  The second workout, Pilates, consists of intensive matwork for the abdominal area.  The moves are quite challenging and would probably not be appropriate for those new to Pilates.  Workout #3 is Ballet, with simple squats and raises designed to tone the legs.  This section moves very quickly and might be a bit difficult to follow at first, especially for those unfamiliar with basic ballet terms.The fourth workout, Kickboxing, provides a brief aerobic workout that would probably be best utilized in combination with other cardio work.  It starts with simple punches, moves into punch combinations with knee lifts, and then introduces various kicks.  Finally, there are a few basic kick-punch combinations to finish.  The last segment, Yoga, is an ideal conclusion to the workout or a nice stretch on its own.  It begins with simple seated postures, moves on to hands and knees, and then includes just a few standing poses.  This section ends with a seated stretch, and it is doable for those with all levels of flexibility.I enjoy the variety offered by this video.  However, since the individual workouts are not very intense (with the exception of the Pilates section), I tend to use the video in combination with other workouts I own.  Some sections of this video are probably too challenging for beginners, so I think it would work best for veteran exercisers who are having difficulties finding the time to work out.",4,Great way to fit exercise into a busy schedule,1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,2048,"['10-Minute', 'Solution', 'five', 'complete', '10-minute', 'fitness', 'programs', 'showcasing', 'different', 'exercise', 'style', 'programs', 'are', 'designed', 'either', 'stand', 'alone', 'be', 'performed', 'together', 'when', 'time', 'can', 'customize', 'workout', 'right', 'Instructor', 'Michelle', 'Nevidomsky', 'Dozois', 'enthusiastic', 'motivating', 'good', 'instruction', 'workout', 'style.The', 'video', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'mix', 'classic', 'toning', 'exercises', 'short', 'low-impact', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'will', 'do', 'lunges', 'bicep', 'curls', 'dumbells', 'tricep', 'dips', 'chair', 'push-ups', 'good', 'full', 'body', 'workout', 'second', 'workout', 'Pilates', 'intensive', 'matwork', 'abdominal', 'area', 'moves', 'are', 'quite', 'challenging', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'appropriate', 'new', 'Pilates', 'Workout', '3', 'Ballet', 'simple', 'squats', 'raises', 'designed', 'tone', 'legs', 'section', 'very', 'quickly', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'difficult', 'follow', 'first', 'especially', 'unfamiliar', 'basic', 'ballet', 'terms.The', 'fourth', 'workout', 'Kickboxing', 'brief', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'utilized', 'combination', 'other', 'cardio', 'work', 'simple', 'punches', 'moves', 'punch', 'combinations', 'knee', 'lifts', 'then', 'various', 'kicks', 'Finally', 'are', 'few', 'basic', 'kick-punch', 'combinations', 'finish', 'last', 'segment', 'Yoga', 'ideal', 'conclusion', 'workout', 'nice', 'stretch', 'own', 'simple', 'seated', 'postures', 'moves', 'hands', 'knees', 'then', 'just', 'few', 'standing', 'poses', 'section', 'seated', 'stretch', 'doable', 'levels', 'flexibility.I', 'enjoy', 'variety', 'offered', 'video', 'However', 'individual', 'workouts', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'intense', 'exception', 'Pilates', 'section', 'tend', 'use', 'video', 'combination', 'other', 'workouts', 'own', 'sections', 'video', 'are', 'probably', 'too', 'challenging', 'beginners', 'think', 'would', 'work', 'best', 'veteran', 'exercisers', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'difficulties', 'finding', 'time', 'work', 'out']",10-Minute Solution - 10 Minute Workouts to Shape Your Whole Body VHS

As everyone else stated, the instructor moves VERY quickly and she's hard to follow the first time around. This will obviously improve with more viewings. Boot camp was a bit difficult because I had trouble following all the jumping. However the workout was over in a flash, and I like when it seems like the time flies by. Pilates was quite difficult as I've only taken one pilates class before, but it makes for a good 10-min ab routine. I had never tried ballet, so I found this interesting and not incredibly difficult. I love kickboxing, so I enjoyed this quick but packed routine. Yoga was very relaxing and is a great cool down/stretch to any workout.I did find the instructor a bit annoying at first but had no problems with her by the end. I might have just been annoyed that I couldn't follow her in boot camp :P Her cueing for the most part is pretty good, but her timing was a bit off in certain sections. If you want to try new workouts, this is perfect. I couldn't imagine only doing one 10-minute segment by itself as your entire workout for the day, but I think any of these workouts make a nice supplement to others and the mix-and-match feature is pretty cool.

Whats important is that in the 3 months we've been doing it, my neighbor has dropped a pant size and I've lost 7 pounds.What is perfect is that each segment has stretching for her leg both before and after the excercises.

471984,A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,6305650713,"Erik Olson ""Seeker Reviews""","[3, 3]","Other reviewers have done a good job highlighting the various aspects of this particular ""10-Minute Solution"" workout, so here's a quick breakdown:GOOD:  This DVD contains a great ten-minute-each sampling of the most popular fitness methods:  Boot Camp, Ballet, Kickboxing, Pilates, and Yoga.  Therefore, you can try them out and see which ones you might want to add to your fitness routine.  If all the workouts are done in order, you'll get a solid strength, flexibility, and cardio workout in fifty minutes.  However, the menu allows you to choose which ones you want to do, and also place them in whatever order you want.  It's easy to mix and match them with your remote, even if you struggle with setting the clock on your DVD player.  You can create a shorter workout if pressed for time, or even a specialized workout routine. For example, mainly cardio=kickboxing and boot camp (with yoga as a cool down).  Mainly strength=pilates, ballet, and yoga.  As for the instructor, she has enthusiasm, good form, and most of the time calls well.GOTCHAS:  There's a lot of exercise crammed into each ten-minute segment, and that affects the workouts in a couple of ways.  First, some of the stretches are over almost before you can get into them.  Second, the transitions can be jarring, especially when the instructor's cues are a bit off.  Finally, a beginner may be overwhelmed by the rapid pace of the workouts.  The boot camp and kickboxing segments are the most intense, so these issues are most noticeable in them.  The other workouts have a slower pace (especially yoga), but are still a bit speedier than a longer version would be.  As you gain fitness and become more familiar with this DVD, these issues should become less of a problem.VERDICT: This is a good addition to any home workout video library.  So far I've been impressed with the ""10-Minute Solution"" line of workout DVDs.

The instructor has good form and is able to do even the more challenging moves with good control.  She also reminds you to do the motions with good form (e.g. squeeze your abs).Before I tried the video, I was skeptical about whether a 10 minute routine would really be a ""workout,"" because most other videos I have tried are still doing slow stretches after 10 minutes.  To my surprise, I found that doing even just one 10 minute segment was making me sweat.  I think the key to this is the instructor keeps moving so that there isn't wasted time spent on talking or waiting around.  She keeps the routine flowing from one movement to the next, so she was able to cram in a suprising number of exercises before the 10minutes were up.For those of you who like to focus on body parts, I would say that the primary areas targeted in each section are boot camp=cardio, pilates=abs, ballet=legs/thighs, kickboxking=arms+cardio, and yoga=stretching.",5,Excellent!

471990,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6305650713,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[29, 30]","When purchasing this workout, my mind was saying: ""You can't get fit in 10 minutes."" I bought it anyway because I intended to do all the 10 minute exercises at once. Can this be done? Sure, it takes you 50 minutes to complete the Boot Camp, Pilates, Ballet, Kickboxing and Yoga sections.My main issue with this workout was that each section moved so fast, it was difficult to keep up with it all the first time. After you learn the moves, it becomes slightly easier. While this doesn't seem to be a beginner workout, it might interest advanced users who might enjoy the ""speed"" challenge. If you have been doing Pilates and Yoga, you will recognize all the main moves.I didn't really enjoy the Kickboxing section because it was much too fast, although I did incorporate some of the moves in my Walk Away the Pounds workouts just for fun. So, you can get a few kicking ideas. If you are looking for speed and creativity, this 10 minute section will amuse you.The Ballet workout moves from side to side, first you are on one side of the chair, then the other. I like workouts where there is no chair, but the moves are rather fast and having a stabilizing object near you is probably advisable.The instruction style is consistent throughout the entire DVD and the instructor displays perfect form. She has super-high energy and seems to excel at all types of exercise.This DVD has three main sections:Create a Personalized WorkoutPick One WorkoutPlay AllOverall an enjoyable workout if you do all five sections at once. Once I start exercising, I like to keep going for at least an hour. This might also be useful if you walk on your treadmill and then just want to do 10 additional minutes of a specific type of workout.~The Rebecca Review",3,Themed Workouts,1086048000,"06 1, 2004",2004,1738,"['When', 'purchasing', 'workout', 'mind', 'was', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'fit', '10', 'minutes', 'bought', 'anyway', 'intended', 'do', '10', 'minute', 'exercises', 'once', 'Can', 'be', 'done', 'Sure', '50', 'minutes', 'complete', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'Pilates', 'Ballet', 'Kickboxing', 'Yoga', 'sections.My', 'main', 'issue', 'workout', 'was', 'section', 'moved', 'so', 'fast', 'was', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'learn', 'moves', 'slightly', 'easier', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'beginner', 'workout', 'might', 'interest', 'advanced', 'users', 'who', 'might', 'enjoy', 'speed', 'challenge', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'will', 'recognize', 'main', 'moves.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'Kickboxing', 'section', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'fast', 'did', 'incorporate', 'moves', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Pounds', 'just', 'fun', 'So', 'can', 'get', 'few', 'kicking', 'ideas', 'are', 'looking', 'speed', 'creativity', '10', 'minute', 'section', 'will', 'amuse', 'you.The', 'Ballet', 'workout', 'moves', 'side', 'side', 'first', 'are', 'one', 'side', 'chair', 'then', 'other', 'like', 'workouts', 'where', 'chair', 'moves', 'are', 'rather', 'fast', 'having', 'stabilizing', 'object', 'probably', 'advisable.The', 'instruction', 'style', 'consistent', 'entire', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'displays', 'perfect', 'form', 'super-high', 'energy', 'excel', 'types', 'exercise.This', 'DVD', 'three', 'main', 'sections', 'Create', 'Personalized', 'WorkoutPick', 'One', 'WorkoutPlay', 'AllOverall', 'enjoyable', 'workout', 'do', 'five', 'sections', 'once', 'Once', 'start', 'exercising', 'like', 'keep', 'going', 'least', 'hour', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'useful', 'walk', 'treadmill', 'then', 'just', 'want', 'do', '10', 'additional', 'minutes', 'specific', 'type', 'workout.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",10-Minute Solution - 10 Minute Workouts to Shape Your Whole Body VHS

471992,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,6305650713,Sheri in Reho,"[4, 4]","One of my goals this month was to increase the duration of my toning/weight workouts (on the days in between cardio workouts).  I had been just doing a 15-minute abs, arms or buns segment from TamiLee Webb's ""I Want That Body!"" workout on most toning days and it wasn't enough.  Now, I do a 15-minute TamiLee segment PLUS one or two of the 10-minute solution workouts and it gives me a more varied (and less boring) workout that works more parts of my body and goes by very quickly!Of the 5 workouts on the DVD, I was able to get through most of them on the first try.  Pilates was the hardest for me.  Then probably Boot Camp.  Kickboxing is tough but it's one of my favorites.  On first viewing, I thought the Ballet segment would be my least favorite, but I have come to really enjoy it--great workout for the legs/hips/behind!  I have always hated yoga (I have arthritis in my spine and a very inflexible body overall and yoga always made me feel like an invalid), but this is a yoga workout I can do and feel good about.After watching the DVD all the way through once without doing any of the workouts, I decided to do all 5 workouts, one right after the other so I could see which I couldn't do or didn't like and which I wanted to incorporate into my exercise routine.  If you don't think that you can get a good workout in 10-minutes, I challenge you to try all 5 together--wow, what a workout!  I was spent after that!I liked the instructor but did feel that some of the workouts went too quickly.  I understand that each workout is only 10 minutes so there is no time to waste but, even so, I felt that some things were difficult to follow because of the speed.  That improves with repetition, thankfully, but until you know the moves by heart, it can be a challenge to keep up!",3,Great way to get variety in your workouts!,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,1788,"['One', 'goals', 'month', 'was', 'increase', 'duration', 'toning/weight', 'workouts', 'days', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'had', 'been', 'just', 'doing', '15-minute', 'abs', 'arms', 'buns', 'segment', 'TamiLee', 'Webb', 'Want', 'Body', 'workout', 'most', 'toning', 'days', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Now', 'do', '15-minute', 'TamiLee', 'segment', 'PLUS', 'one', 'two', '10-minute', 'solution', 'workouts', 'more', 'varied', 'less', 'boring', 'more', 'parts', 'body', 'very', 'quickly', '5', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'most', 'first', 'try', 'Pilates', 'was', 'hardest', 'Then', 'probably', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'Kickboxing', 'tough', 'one', 'favorites', 'first', 'viewing', 'thought', 'Ballet', 'segment', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'favorite', 'have', 'come', 'really', 'enjoy', 'great', 'workout', 'legs/hips/behind', 'have', 'always', 'hated', 'yoga', 'have', 'arthritis', 'spine', 'very', 'inflexible', 'body', 'overall', 'yoga', 'always', 'made', 'feel', 'invalid', 'yoga', 'can', 'do', 'feel', 'good', 'about.After', 'watching', 'DVD', 'way', 'once', 'doing', 'workouts', 'decided', 'do', '5', 'workouts', 'one', 'right', 'other', 'could', 'see', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'wanted', 'incorporate', 'exercise', 'routine', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'workout', '10-minutes', 'challenge', 'try', '5', 'together', 'wow', 'what', 'workout', 'was', 'spent', 'liked', 'instructor', 'did', 'feel', 'workouts', 'went', 'too', 'quickly', 'understand', 'workout', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'time', 'waste', 'even', 'so', 'felt', 'things', 'were', 'difficult', 'follow', 'speed', 'repetition', 'thankfully', 'know', 'moves', 'heart', 'can', 'be', 'challenge', 'keep', 'up']",10-Minute Solution - 10 Minute Workouts to Shape Your Whole Body VHS

Burleson ""52 workout""","[0, 0]","I ordered this video because I wanted a little taste of ballet and of kickboxing without having to buy a video of either of them.  I love 10 Minute Solution's format, so this was perfect.  The video suits my purpose exactly.The boot camp section is not a challenge at all, especially compared to some of the other videos I have, but it does get you warmed up for the rest of the video.  The second section, the abs (Pilates) section, is still a challenge for me - mostly just for endurance.  I can do all the exercises, just not without resting between them.  The third section is the ballet.  I'm glad I ordered this video instead of a ballet video.  I can handle 10 minutes of ballet, but the truth is, I don't like it as much as I thought I would.  My favorite section is the 4th one, the kickboxing.  Here again, I wouldn't want a whole video of it, but 10 minutes is really fun.The last section is yoga, but it's only a sample of relaxing or stretching yoga.  It's great for a wind-down from the rest of the video, but if you're looking for a good yoga workout, get either of 10 Minute Solution's yoga videos.Overall, I like the video because it's a great variety.",4,Good variety,1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,1169,"['ordered', 'video', 'wanted', 'little', 'taste', 'ballet', 'kickboxing', 'having', 'buy', 'video', 'love', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'format', 'was', 'perfect', 'video', 'suits', 'purpose', 'exactly.The', 'boot', 'camp', 'section', 'not', 'challenge', 'especially', 'compared', 'other', 'videos', 'have', 'get', 'warmed', 'up', 'rest', 'video', 'second', 'section', 'abs', 'Pilates', 'section', 'still', 'challenge', 'mostly', 'just', 'endurance', 'can', 'do', 'exercises', 'just', 'not', 'resting', 'third', 'section', 'ballet', ""'m"", 'glad', 'ordered', 'video', 'instead', 'ballet', 'video', 'can', 'handle', '10', 'minutes', 'ballet', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'favorite', 'section', '4th', 'one', 'kickboxing', 'Here', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'whole', 'video', '10', 'minutes', 'really', 'fun.The', 'last', 'section', 'yoga', 'only', 'sample', 'relaxing', 'stretching', 'yoga', 'great', 'wind-down', 'rest', 'video', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'yoga', 'workout', 'get', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'yoga', 'videos.Overall', 'like', 'video', 'great', 'variety']",10-Minute Solution - 10 Minute Workouts to Shape Your Whole Body VHS

Abs are great for days when your workout doesn't use your core. The sides of my legs usually ache the day after the ballet workout.
