I remembered the series from when it was briefly on network TV many years ago.  I was pleased to see how well it stood the test of time, and that there were some episodes in the collection that never aired on television.  The stories and acting were great, and the creature effects were exceptional.  I should point out that these are faithful retellings of old stories without a Disney &#34;happy ending&#34; guarantee.  Stories vary from humorous to scary, and most of the greek legends had sad endings.I feel the series is definitely worth owning, and a must for Henson fans.",5,Henson at his best,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,669,"['bought', 'Storyteller', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'much', 'more', 'affordable', 'remembered', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'briefly', 'network', 'TV', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'were', 'episodes', 'collection', 'never', 'aired', 'television', 'stories', 'acting', 'were', 'great', 'creature', 'effects', 'were', 'exceptional', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'are', 'faithful', 'retellings', 'old', 'stories', 'Disney', '34', 'happy', 'ending', '34', 'guarantee', 'Stories', 'vary', 'humorous', 'scary', 'most', 'greek', 'legends', 'had', 'sad', 'endings.I', 'feel', 'series', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning', 'must', 'Henson', 'fans']",N/A

Each story is based on some old, mostly European, folk tales - the &quot;real&quot; kind with mayhem, a bit of violence, and some sad endings, not the Disney kind.  Thus, you may find them a tad upsetting for younger kids who have been raised to expect happy endings.For example, in &quot;The Heartless Giant,&quot; an imprisoned Giant lies to a young prince to effect his escape, and meets a sad end at the hand of the prince's brothers.  In &quot;The Soldier and Death,&quot; a generous soldier receives a magic bag and uses it to imprison Death himself (a very scary-looking guy).  Despite dominion over Death the soldier is unhappy by the end.So, these are stories with an almost adult level of sophistication.  The production values are wonderful and the performances steller (I especially like John Hurd as the Storyteller character, who appears in all the episodes).BUT - watch the episodes first to make sure your own young ones won't be overwhelmed.

Not only does he narrate, but stars in them as well, playing himself, the Storyteller. Of course, his dog was pretty good too! You might recognize the voice as the same one as Hoggle from 'Labyrinth'.There are a number of different episodes on the DVD, although this brings up some questions I had about it. On the DVD packaging it says something like ""Contains All Episodes, Including One Never Before Aired...."". I found this not to be true. If you do a search in VHS for Storyteller, you'll find several videos that contain episodes of 'The Storyteller' that aren't on the DVD. The other four episodes are all based on greek mythology, and are apparently available on DVD in Europe in PAL format. Oh well.The stories themselves are folk tales from various european countries. Several of which served as the basis for other stories such as the story of Cinderella. I found all of them to be very entertaining. So much so, that I sat and watched the entire DVD in one sitting. That's saying alot when each episode is around 45 minutes long!As far as the quality of the encoding goes, I've heard talk that it's bad. I never saw anything on the disk that would make me question the integrity of the encoding.

761580,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B0000A2ZU6,G. Denick,"[1, 1]","As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are ""alternative"" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!I first watched this television show when it aired in the late 1980s, and I hadn't seen it again until just recently. To my delight, I discovered that these grim fairy tales have retained the same magic that they had when I first saw them as a child. With a delightful mix of humans, puppetry, and clever effects, Jim Henson weaves each tale with his unique eye (and ear) for visual storytelling. Unfortunately, the video quality is quite poor (even on Netflix streaming), but these short stories are so enjoyable, it barely matters. Younger viewers might be somewhat turned off by the dated effects, but I suspect they will be ensnared by the magic of Jim Henson, which more than makes up for the passage of so many years. And for those of us who grew up with the many muppets of Henson, this collection is a pure joy. With elements of the supernatural and a touch of Old World grimness, ""The Storyteller"" is a perfect ""alternative"" Halloween selection for these crisp October nights!",5,The magic of Jim Henson lives on!,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,1605,"['mid', 'October', 'rolls', 'around', 'brisk', 'winds', 'sweep', 'crisp', 'autumn', 'air', 'jack', ""o'lanterns"", 'decorate', 'steps', 'porches', 'scent', 'wood', 'smoke', 'wood', 'stoves', 'leaves', 'are', 'peak', 'season', 'color', 'October', 'magnificent', 'month', 'celebration', 'annual', 'visit', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'review', 'few', 'great', 'flicks', 'Halloween', 'season', 'titles', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'review', 'are', 'alternative', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'not', 'classics', 'generally', 'spring', 'mind', 'fun', 'movies', 'elements', 'supernatural', 'Just', 'good', 'lighthearted', 'stuff', 'here', 'nothing', 'gory', 'scary', 'least', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'watched', 'television', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'late', '1980s', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'again', 'just', 'recently', 'delight', 'discovered', 'grim', 'fairy', 'tales', 'have', 'retained', 'same', 'magic', 'had', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'child', 'delightful', 'mix', 'humans', 'puppetry', 'clever', 'effects', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'tale', 'unique', 'eye', 'ear', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'Unfortunately', 'video', 'quality', 'quite', 'poor', 'even', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'short', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'barely', 'matters', 'Younger', 'viewers', 'might', 'be', 'somewhat', 'turned', 'off', 'dated', 'effects', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'ensnared', 'magic', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'more', 'up', 'passage', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'many', 'muppets', 'Henson', 'collection', 'pure', 'joy', 'elements', 'supernatural', 'touch', 'Old', 'World', 'grimness', 'Storyteller', 'perfect', 'alternative', 'Halloween', 'selection', 'crisp', 'October', 'nights']",N/A
761581,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0000A2ZU6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Note that this incomplete Complete DVD Collection does NOT include Michael Gambon's Greek tales. With that in mind... In 1987 and 1988, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER aired and became an instant showpiece for television, a triumphant and yet short-lived series breathing fresh life into nine lesser-known northern European fairy tales and, later, into four timeless stories drawn from Greek mythology. These old folk and fairy tales, mined from countries such as Germany and Russia, along with the Greek tales, are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers: John Hurt for the European fables and Michael Gambon for the Greek re-tellings. But, with much respect to Mr. Gambon, who himself does a fine job, it is John Hurt who decidedly draws my attention. Hurt, with the more eye-catching portrayal, is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful, quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.It doesn't hurt that the stories featuring Hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by Anthony Minghella, who, nearly a decade later, would win an Oscar for directing THE ENGLISH PATIENT. As such, this collection gloriously lives up to expectations. John Hurt's performance evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories. Minghella's screenplays are replete with rich, witty wordplay and recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up. Viewing these episodes, it really does feel as if you're sitting around the fire, captivated at the feet of a master spinner of yarns.Michael Gambon is burdened with the weightier and grimmer Greek tales. He eschews John Hurt's ebullient touch, opting instead to exhibit a more proper and somber persona. And he's pretty dang good. Both Hurt and Gambon, by the way, are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog (as operated by Brian Henson).At a half hour per episode, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER is presented in a marriage of live acting, creative animatronics, and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery. Jim Henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values, coming up with vivid special effects (for its time), seamless puppetry, matte paintings, and yeoman make-up work, all these to plant the viewer firmly in that fantasy setting. A charming quirk of the series is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the interludes with the Storyteller. The camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace, but, somewhere in the background, whether it's on a painting in the back or on the surface of a nearby jar or cup, images depicting the story are set in motion. It's neat.The stories themselves are more mature and darker than any kid's fable we're used to over here, especially the Greek entries. Several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones (""The Soldier and Death,"" ""The Heartless Giant""). But don't keep the kids from watching this series; everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of these stories. It does help that most of these tales are little known in the States, which allows the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there. When was the last time that CINDERELLA or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, timeless as they are, offered up anything new? This is just about as perfect as a television show can get. All the episodes are superb, but if I had to pick favorites, I would go with ""Hans My Hedgehog,"" ""The Soldier and Death"" and ""The Three Ravens."" With several recognizable name actors lending their talents to this series, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER, I feel, is a MUST HAVE dvd set.The nine European fables:""Hans My Hedgehog"" - From an early German folk tale: A barren peasant woman, desperately craving a child, naively says aloud that if she had a baby, she wouldn't care what it looks like. Soon enough, she gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog, much to the father's dismay and the scorn of the villagers.""Fearnot"" - From an early German folk tale: A carefree, absent-minded boy who never scares goes on a strange journey to discover fear. Though still very good, this may be the weakest episode of the lot. Gabrielle Anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role.""A Story Short"" - From an early Celtic folk tale: The Storyteller himself is in the spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of the royal cook and, as punishment meted out by the king, must tell one story a day for a year. All goes well until the very last day when the Storyteller suffers from storyteller's block. Brenda Blethyn has a part.""The Luck Child"" - From an early Russian folk tale: Seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of a seventh son of a seventh son someday supplanting the current king, the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and attempts to do away with him. But those blessed with luck cannot be undone...and the same could be said for prophecies.The Soldier & Death"" - From an early Russian folk tale, this is an awesome story. Because of kind acts towards three beggars, an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack, a deck of cards, and a nice whistle, which he uses to save a kingdom and to foil Death.""The True Bride"" - From an early German folk tale. Shades of Aslan! A white lion comes to the aid of a girl (Jane Horrocks, LITTLE VOICE) being held under the cruel care of a troll. Co-starring Sean Bean.""The Three Ravens"" - From an early German folk tale: A wicked witch (Miranda Richardson) weds a widowed king (Jonathan Pryce) and then, recognizing that the king's three sons and daughter pose a threat to her ambition, transforms the three sons into ravens. But the princess (Joely Richardson) escapes and is told by her brothers that, unless she remains speechless for three years, three months, and three days, they'll be trapped in their raven forms forever.""Sapsorrow"" - From an early German folk tale: A variant on Cinderella (or is it the other way around?), a beautiful princess (Alison Doody), seeking to escape an arranged marriage, flees to a distant kingdom and disguises herself as a loathsome hag. But, then, she falls in love with the prince... Co-starring Jennifer Saunders.""The Heartless Giant"" - From an early German folk tale: On the whole, giants are benign creatures, harmless to none, unless, of course, the giant hasn't a heart. This story is about a curious prince who is fooled into freeing one such heartless giant from the king's dungeon...And the Greek myths (again, NOT included):""Daedalus and Icarus"" - The inventor Daedalus and his son Icarus flee from the wicked King Minos with the aid of Daedalus's man-made wings, but will Icarus heed his father's advice? I'm guessing, not.""Orpheus and Eurydice"" - The musician Orpheus descends to Hades to bring back his dead wife.""Perseus and the Gorgon"" - The hero Perseus faces the Gorgon, Medusa.""Theseus and the Minotaur"" - It's Theseus, with help from a beautiful princess, versus the savage Minotaur, half-man, half-bull.",5,The best place by the fire was kept for...the Storyteller,1331769600,"03 15,

One is a Cinderella story, Sapsorrow, but the others are all lesser-known tales.John Hurt is perfect as the Storyteller:  His voice, mannerisms, humor, and interaction with the dog (to whom he is telling the stories) are all perfect and engaging.The Henson/Muppet expertise is wonderfully done and really brings the creatures and the dog to full life in expression, movement, voice, etc.  My favorites of this collection are Hans, My Hedgehog and The Luck Child.  The use of traditional staging, costuming, props, make-up, etc., rather than high-tech graphics, makes these tales true treasures.I remember enjoying this series on HBO; the DVD collection has fantastic picture quality and sound and includes all of the fairy tales of the series, but does not include the Greek Myths.  (They are available on a separate DVD, also recommended.)I absolutely love this style of storytelling and particularly this collection of beautifully staged fairy tales.

I love the stories themselves, and I'm willing to make allowances for graphics - it was only the eighties. It was sad to see so little in the way of extra features - make that nothing by the way of extra features, which was a severe letdown. The picture is often fuzzy and I get the impression it was put down in the mindset of &quot;Let's just get this done&quot;.Now, if you're buying it just for the stories (and as I said, you can look beyond skeptical graphics) - you shouldn't be disappointed. Take it in the spirit that it is meant. And I still think the thought lion from &quot;The True Bride&quot; is my favorite character, and Death from &quot;A Soldier and Death&quot; still gives me the creeps.

761586,A2WJCE8VF3STFW,B0000A2ZU6,Judith,"[1, 1]","This set is like two different projects.  The first disc of fairy tales told by John Hurt is five star all the way.  The second disk of Greek myths earns about three stars.Let's dispense with the Greek Myths first.  They are familiar myths presented well enough, but there is no magic.  Since you already know the stories, this won't captivate you.  It's just too bad John Hurt wasn't the storyteller on this disk, too.Now the fairy tale disk is wonderful.  Do not think of this as kid's stuff.  Not at all.  In fact, there is even one story with nudity seen in silhouette.  It's not graphic, but will likely be enough to have the children giggling like hyenas.  Many of the stories will be somewhat familiar to you, but they are fleshed out in more detail than you'll remember from your picture book days.For instance, Sapsorrow is basically Cinderella, but with several twists.  Sapsorrow is a King's daughter who is under a spell.  She is covered with fur and feathers, and is working as a lowly servant in a castle.  She adores the handsome prince (James WIlby) but he only notices the dirt and fur.  He is looking for a bride, so a series of balls are held.  Sapsorrow's animal and bird friends make her beautiful.  (No fairy godmother.)  The Prince falls in love with her, but of course, she must flee, leaving behind her golden slipper.  (Not glass.)  Meanwhile, the prince has begun talking with Sapsorrow, and they become friendly, but he doesn't know her true identity.  As in Cinderella, the prince invites all the ladies to try on the slipper.  Sapsorrow's bad sisters (one played hilariously by Dawn French of Wicar of Dimbley fame) arrive to try it on.  Of course, it only fits Sapsorrow, still in her fur and feathers.  The prince agrees to marry, dirt and all.  Then the animals transform her.Other stories are about a woman who gives birth to a hedgehog baby, stone soup, and all manner of trolls and ogres.

The language is very rich and culturally charged, the stories are old folk-tales, the music is haunting, and the special effects usually involve muppets!  While the last sounds like it would be silly, it's no worse (and a little more classy) than the bad special effects in many films (old and new) and the final presentation is often hauntingly beautiful.

I am still waiting for Fraggle Rock, but hopefully that is on the horizon.I remember these as part of the Jim Henson Hour (another series I would like to see again) and they were as enjoyable to watch as they are now.I gave the DVD 3 stars, simply because it's just that. . . a DVD. No extra's no behind the scenes, nothing added to it, just the stories, one after another in a digital format.  The content and movies are great, its just that, well, there wasn't anything else.  Kind of disappointing, but I'm sure back then, they didn't have a lot of cameras on the set filming behind the scenes, it wasn't the fad or desire back then.This is a dvd though, that's not for kids.  Young kids that is.  Some pretty spooky moments, and the creatures can be a bit scarey.  It's a fairly dark, gritty form of story telling, but fun and amusing at times.To wrap up, its great.  If your a fan of Jim, it belongs in your DVD library.  No extras though, just the 9 episodes and that's it.  The sound is good, picture great, just as I remember them.

Creator or co-creator of such classics as the Muppets and Sesame Street, his company put together this string of TV shows in the late 1980s.  Comprised of 13 tales; 4 from ancient Greece and 9 from medieval Europe; each is turned into a separate story of 20 - 30 minutes in length.  Each tells one or more morals; and comprises elements of romance, comedy, tragedy, suspence and action.  The four Greek stories are well known to anyone who stayed awake in their high school literature classes.  The 9 European stories, on the other hand, are less well known.  But all are told wonderfully, from the point of view of the storyteller, and his dog.  The storyteller character is portrayed by Michael Gambon (Dumbeldorf in the Harry Potter movies) and John Hurt.  The stories themselves have both human and muppet characters.  A careful viewing reveals many actors and actresses who would go on to become famous; Colin Farrel, Sean Bean, Miranda Richardson, etc...All the stories have good dialogue, no sex or nudity, no bad language, and enough action to satisfy teenagers but without scaring the kids.

If Jim Henson were still alive today, I'm sure he would still be pushing the boundaries of storytelling, film-making, and creativity.  He takes some European folk-tales that are lesser known in the U.S. and frames them in the realm of a fireside storyteller telling an engrossing narrative.  The writing is very well done.  If you are interested in the past or present of oral storytelling, whether related to Alaska Native, Native American, European, African, Asian, or whatever, these films are a great dramatic representation of the heritage many of us have from a pre-literacy age.  The Greek Myths are also well told, and include many details I have never heard before in these tales.  I would suggest those especially for teachers to use in class.

With great programs like The Muppet Show and Fraggle Rock, who doesn't have fond memories of watching these lovable Muppets!I remember looking forward to watching The Storyteller when I was like 10. It was a half an hour of dark enchanting folk tales brought to life by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Every episode starts with the old Storyteller introducing the story to his lovable, grouchy dog. He tells the dark tales with wit and humor but he never candy coats the bad parts. There are scenes that have death, and not everyone has a happy ending. The refreshing part about this series is that it wasn't made for the kiddie market, like the Fraggles. The stories are dark like the folk tales of old are ment to be. So it is appealing to older children and adults alike.Also, the dvd can be educational for children who think that stories like Beauty and the Beast were invented by Walt Disney. You can see the roots of those popular stories in these tales.If you are the kind of person who likes to sit down with your children, or even by yourself, and watch fantasticly made stories of fantasy, like Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal, then I would highly recommend The Storyteller.

761602,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0000A2ZU6,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[19, 19]","Jim Henson's most famous contribution to the entertainment world is obviously &quot;The Muppets&quot;, but if you're looking for his best work (in terms of both visual brilliancy and depth of theme and meaning) the award would have to go to &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The Storyteller.&quot; The former is of course the famous movie starring David Bowie, but the latter was a television series that was made up of a collaboration of Anthony Minghella's screenplays that drew on a range of folklore and ancient storytelling, Jim Henson's amazing puppets and John Hurt's performance as a nameless, gnome-like storyteller who sits by the fire with his (extremely talkative) dog, speaking directly to the viewer of the marvellous things he's seen and done in his lifetime.There are nine episodes altogether, each one about twenty-five minutes long, with a separate tale in each one. Each one is both narrated by the Storyteller, but also acted out by a separate group of actors with which the Storyteller and his dog interact with - and it's not just them entering the world of the stories (such as the Storyteller performing a card trick in the court of the king)- sometimes the stories invade their fireside hearth: figures appear in the flames of the fire, shadows perform on the sides of pots and cups, the dog looks into his bowl to see faces looking up at him, and often the Storyteller produces objects that feature in the stories as proof of their reality.Each story is very different, both from each other and from their original source material in order to create tales that are new, but also deeply familiar. Archetypes such as foundling children, wicked stepmothers, fay-like helpers, magical implements and triad motifs are prevalient, and you'll be surprised at how many familiar faces turn up! Some of the episodes are melded from several stories (such as &quot;The Soldier and Death&quot; which uses three Slovac tales to piece together a longer story) but others simply change a few details from their original sources (&quot;The Three Ravens&quot; uses ravens instead of swans as seen in the myth &quot;The Children of Lyr&quot; or Hans Christian Anderson's later retelling &quot;The Seven Wild Swans&quot;) Spotting the similarities is part of the fun of watching, but a warning to parents - not all of the stories end happily, and often the content itself can be violent, scary, enigmatic or even mildly sensual.&quot;Hans My Hedgehog&quot; is the winner of several television awards, and tells a darker version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;East O' the Sun and West O' the Moon&quot;, of a woman who makes a wayward wish for a baby and ends up with a hedgehog for a son.&quot;Fearnot&quot; is the story of a young man that is so cheerful and simple that he has no idea what it's like to quiver and shudder in fear. Determined to know what the sensation is like he sets of - but the answer to being afraid may lie closer to home than he thinks...&quot;The Heartless Giant&quot; is the bittersweet tale of a young prince named Leo who befriends a giant that has a nest of wasps in place of his heart. But can such a creature be trusted?&quot;Sapsorrow&quot; is an interesting take on the &quot;Cinderella&quot; legend, as well as &quot;Donkeyskin&quot; in which a young woman seems to be forced to marry her own father if he does not hide herself within an elaborate disguise.&quot;The Three Ravens&quot; is one of my favourites - three brothers are turned into ravens by their stepmother, and it is up to their sister to break the curse by never speaking a word. But when she falls in love and finds her beloved's stepmother is the witch that caused her brother's grief her danger intensifies: her children begin to disappear, and she cannot speak to defend herself.&quot;The True Bride&quot; is the story of Anja, the slave of a troll who is helped by a beautiful white lion into getting her fortune. But when her financee (Sean Bean!!) is kidnapped by the troll's daughter, she leaves all her riches in order to get him back.&quot;The Soldier and Death&quot; tells of a soldier who manages to a deal with devils that results in him capturing Death itself in his sack. The portrayal of Death is fascinating, and the puppetry of the devils is amazing.&quot;A Story Short&quot; is the Storyteller's own story about beggars and fleas, a cruel wife, a deal with a king and a pot of boiling oil. This is another of my favourites.Finally, &quot;The Luck Child&quot; concerns a young man named Lucky who is fated to be the next ruler of the land.

The good news is the MSRP on this collection is actually less than the release price of the original Storyteller collection and about the same price of the release of Greek Myths disk. You'll be getting the best deal ever offered with this collection.If you don't currently have both collections I recommend getting this.

Boring, and a cop-out.  It's like the director avoided the hard shots because the technology (or the budget) just wasn't there at the time.  You can count on a lot of wheezy exposition by the actors and by the storyteller himself, with only a tiny bit of the Henson creature magic you're really looking for.  It's the tv-show equivalent of moving in the margins on your term paper to make it look longer when you don't really have anything great to say.

However, THE STORYTELLER remains the Henson series that I remember most vividly and I believe it had a huge influence upon my life, illustrating to me the power of a good story and that fairy tales really do make great television viewing. Only about half of the nine episodes collected here originally aired in the U.S. The rest aired nearly a year later.  The episodes in the series (and on the DVD) are as follows:&quot;Hans My Hedghog&quot;--a story about a boy born half human/half hedgehog. The boy leaves home, builds a castle, and grows into an adult. He eventually saves a king's life and marries the king's daughter. Through the relationship, the princess learns lessons about the negative power of gossip and how truth and love can conquer all.&quot;The True Bride&quot;--a princess has her fiance taken away by a female troll.  The story illustrates the power of true love.&quot;Fearnot&quot;--Fearnot is a young man who has no fear. Monsters and people with axes are nothing but curiosities to him. After searching the world to learn fear, he is shown what true fear is by the person he loves most.&quot;The Luck Child&quot;--On the birth of the 7th son of a 7th son, a prophet predicts that the child will one day be king. The cruel king does everything in his power to kill the youth, but is unsuccessful at every turn. The evil king eventually learns that greed is not good.&quot;Sapsorrow&quot;--a twisted version of the Cinderella story where a young woman weaves a cloak of animal fur and feathers and runs away after she is supposed to marry her father. She becomes a fearful and loathsome creature but helps a prince destroy his pride.&quot;The Three Ravens&quot;-- a story about a wicked witch who marries a king a secretly turns his three sons into Ravens. The king's daughter discovers the truth and is the only person who can break the witch's evil spell.&quot;The Heartless Giant&quot;--a sad story about a boy who risks all to give a heartless giant his heart back.&quot;The Soldier and Death&quot;--this is my favorite STORYTELLER episode. It's about a soldier who through his kindness is given a magic sack. Using the sack, the soldier captures food, demons, and eventually even Death. However, a sinful world without death isn't necessarily a perfect world. This episode was directed by Jim Henson.&quot;A Story Short&quot;--the only story where the Storyteller himself is the main character.

761617,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0000A2ZU6,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[89, 92]","I'm amazed that this series has gotten so little attention. This is Jim Henson and crew at their best, making fun of the lines between fantasy and reality, costume and puppetry, and new storytelling and old stories.All of these short pieces were unfamiliar to me, at least in part. 'Sapsorrow' turned out to contain a story I knew, or thought I did. Part of the reason these fairy tales were unfamiliar was their authenticity. These stories were originally meant for adults. They had hard, dark edges, and were not the vapid Disneyfied versions that most people know.Lots of kids will like these stories as much as adults do, but this may be too much for younger children. This isn't Sesame Street - it's one of the dark alleys off to the side.The narrator is one of the unexpected treats on this disk. He opens and closes each short story, talking to his dog on a fire-lit night. The narration is a treat, too. It has a wonderful rolling cadence, too musical for regular speech but too prosaic to be a chant. It may give you some idea what the old epic poems must have sounded like in their original settings.This is for anyone who likes fantasy, who likes a rich visual experience. You just have to see it for yourself - written words can't begin to give the experience you'll find in this collection.//wiredweird",5,Fairy tales will never be the same,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,1315,"[""'m"", 'amazed', 'series', 'gotten', 'so', 'little', 'attention', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'crew', 'best', 'making', 'fun', 'lines', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'costume', 'puppetry', 'new', 'storytelling', 'old', 'stories.All', 'short', 'pieces', 'were', 'unfamiliar', 'least', 'part', ""'Sapsorrow"", 'turned', 'out', 'contain', 'story', 'knew', 'thought', 'did', 'Part', 'reason', 'fairy', 'tales', 'were', 'unfamiliar', 'was', 'authenticity', 'stories', 'were', 'originally', 'meant', 'adults', 'had', 'hard', 'dark', 'edges', 'were', 'not', 'vapid', 'Disneyfied', 'versions', 'most', 'people', 'know.Lots', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'stories', 'as', 'much', 'adults', 'do', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'younger', 'children', ""n't"", 'Sesame', 'Street', 'one', 'dark', 'alleys', 'side.The', 'narrator', 'one', 'unexpected', 'treats', 'disk', 'short', 'story', 'talking', 'dog', 'fire-lit', 'night', 'narration', 'treat', 'too', 'wonderful', 'rolling', 'cadence', 'too', 'musical', 'regular', 'speech', 'too', 'prosaic', 'be', 'chant', 'may', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'old', 'epic', 'must', 'have', 'sounded', 'original', 'settings.This', 'anyone', 'who', 'fantasy', 'who', 'rich', 'visual', 'experience', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'written', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'give', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'find', 'collection.//wiredweird']",N/A
761618,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B0000A2ZU6,Zack Davisson,"[4, 4]","""The Storyteller"" stands as one of the best, yet little known, fantasy series of all times.  What a perfect blend of elegant puppetry, skillful acting, fantastic tales and old-fashioned storytelling.John Hurt is astounding as the Storyteller, laboring under thick makeup that gives him a puppet-like effect in his own right.  His voice is commanding under the disguise, and while he is the narrator, he is often the star of each tale.  His companion the Dog lends a surprisingly human tone, with Brian Henson's voice being identical to the character of Hoggle in ""Labyrinth.""  The Henson Puppet Factory must have been working overtime with this series, as the creatures are as amazing and creative as anything seen in a feature film or on the various Muppet TV programs.All of the stories have a darker tone, very serious and somber.  This is definitely a work aimed at adults, although children will also enjoy it.  It is almost impossible to pick any favorite episodes, although ""The Soldier and Death,"" with it's Devils, trip to the Gates of Hell and Heaven, and the creepy, creepy vision of Death would probably be on top.  ""Fearnot,"" the story of the Boy who never Quivered and his quest to know fear is equally excellent, full of ghosts and monsters and noodles, and games of nine-pin played with bones and human skulls.  ""A Story Short,"" ""Hans My Hedgehog,""...I could go one with praise for each episode.  Definitely a DVD you will watch over and over again.In the words of the Soldier, ""Worth a farthing?
