Kramer ""Carpenter L..U 45""","[3, 6]","...about this flick.Well lately all that has been released are low budget Zombie flicks, which is common, but these being really low I mean bad acting which in much of a sense really hurts these movies that have potential and would be alot better if maybe just maybe a somewhat known actor or 2 who could act would be involved in the film.The plot is ok being its world war 3 and some sort of radioactive chemicals are turning people into Zombies.Which leads a couple diffenerent groups of families and individuals to oddly meet up in the middle of know where in some type of ware house.Now the setting and everything just dont work the way all these characters seem to meet just doesnt fit and where they get where they are and why the hell they are there, along with alot of useless dialogue makes the flick get very boring very quickly and hard to keep you focused as I watched in 3 intravals just to get through it.The cover art looks great which I think is very misleading, but the Zombies are well done for the budget as well as the gore is pretty good, that is a definite plus for this flick. Maybe if they would have cut down the amount of $$ they put towards the make-up effects and concentrated more on  using that cash to get some actors that were at least  better or for that were even able to act this flick would have been a bit better.These film needs alot of work to become anything good, and I hate to knock a writer and director and the rest of the crew as they did the best they could, great , bu tim here to give my opinion on the movie not the effort.the price for this is decent which can make it worth the money if you are into movies with very bad acting very low budgets and a plot where everything is out of place, but is quit GORY, then this is your flick. And like I said the make up effects for themost part are the only plus in this film as there is alot of it and it is quit well done something know one can knock.You can rent it at blockbuster as I did, and  maybe Hollywood video would have it as well. Its better off to give it a rent b4 buying it off amazon and wasting $14.00 plus the shipping for a very bad acted and set movie, but if you like violence and blood and can just sit there through this pretty bad movie just to view that then get you will be happy.I remeember Primal Fear was selling this on there website for $24 plus delievery and they were saying on the site get it b4 it is released for more money in stores, yeah well it wasnt released for more and glad I waited, plus they are making a part 2.

Example, in one part of the film a zombie gets his leg blasted off just below the knee, when the zombie is rolling around on the ground with No leg, you can see the actor has his lower leg in a hole with the latex and prosthetics around his knee.

936533,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000B66GVK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Zombie Night (David J. Francis, 2004)Here's a tip, aspiring makers of zombie movies: the zombies are supposed to be the bad guys, not your intended audience.Zombie Night, the first and only film written by (and featuring, in a small role) the late Amber Lynn Francis, is a movie I feel terrible about trashing. But, you know, the piece of poetry that shows at the beginning of the movie tells you all you need to know about this movie; it's awful. Where can you go from there? Yes, you can-- no matter how far down you are, there's always a gutter beneath you.The episodic, rambling script hands us Dave (Danny Ticknovich), his wife Shelley (Sandra Segovic), and their daughter Amber (Andrea Ramolo) as main characters. They've been up in the woods in a cabin for two weeks with no contact with the outside world; when they come back to civilization, it's been overrun by zombies. They don't know that at first, however, because the zombies only come out at night. (Oddly, I can't remember ever seeing that twist in a zombie movie before, so points for originality.) As they try to survive, they stumble into other survivors, including dashing male-lead Rick (Jason Riley) and psychotic Derek (Duane Moniz), along with a bunch of others, putting together a band of survivors to try and find someplace safe and stable where they can barricade themselves in. (Until what?, you may ask yourself. Until what?, indeed.) Of course, everything that can go wrong does.The script is pretty standard-- the zombies are basically window dressing, with most of the action focusing on the survivors and the power struggles within the group, as most good zombie films do. It's got some interesting twists in it, as well (the ""only coming out at night"" theme is only one of the variations). However, as good as the script may have been, its realization is a complete mess. The acting never rises above the level of substandard. The director shows the potential to become competent, but doesn't realize any of it here; the angles always seem just a touch off, the lighting is either a bit too dark or a bit too light, etc. And the acting. I've seen some really basement-budget pictures staffed entirely with no-name actors that have blown me away (Shallow Ground, recently, comes to mind). This is not one of them. There was better acting in Midnight Skater. And that's saying something.Some have opined that this falls into the ""so bad it's good"" category. I can certainly see that; this is definitely a movie with which one could come up with any number of great drinking games. But as a serious piece of zombie cinema, it's better than Day of the Dead 2: Contagium. But not much. *",1,Unintentionally hysterical.,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2667,"['Zombie', 'Night', 'David', 'J.', 'Francis', '2004', 'Here', 'tip', 'aspiring', 'makers', 'zombie', 'movies', 'zombies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'guys', 'not', 'intended', 'audience.Zombie', 'Night', 'first', 'only', 'film', 'written', 'featuring', 'small', 'role', 'late', 'Amber', 'Lynn', 'Francis', 'movie', 'feel', 'terrible', 'trashing', 'know', 'piece', 'poetry', 'beginning', 'movie', 'need', 'know', 'movie', 'awful', 'Where', 'can', 'go', 'there', 'Yes', 'can', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'always', 'gutter', 'beneath', 'you.The', 'episodic', 'rambling', 'script', 'hands', 'Dave', 'Danny', 'Ticknovich', 'wife', 'Shelley', 'Sandra', 'Segovic', 'daughter', 'Amber', 'Andrea', 'Ramolo', 'main', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'been', 'up', 'woods', 'cabin', 'two', 'weeks', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'when', 'come', 'back', 'civilization', 'been', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'however', 'zombies', 'only', 'come', 'out', 'night', 'Oddly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'seeing', 'twist', 'zombie', 'movie', 'points', 'originality', 'try', 'survive', 'stumble', 'other', 'survivors', 'including', 'dashing', 'male-lead', 'Rick', 'Jason', 'Riley', 'psychotic', 'Derek', 'Duane', 'Moniz', 'bunch', 'others', 'putting', 'together', 'band', 'survivors', 'try', 'find', 'someplace', 'safe', 'stable', 'where', 'can', 'barricade', 'what', 'may', 'ask', 'what', 'indeed', 'course', 'everything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'does.The', 'script', 'pretty', 'standard', 'zombies', 'are', 'basically', 'window', 'dressing', 'most', 'action', 'focusing', 'survivors', 'power', 'group', 'most', 'good', 'zombie', 'films', 'do', 'got', 'interesting', 'twists', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'coming', 'out', 'night', 'theme', 'only', 'one', 'variations', 'However', 'as', 'good', 'script', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'realization', 'complete', 'mess', 'acting', 'never', 'rises', 'level', 'substandard', 'director', 'potential', 'become', 'competent', ""n't"", 'realize', 'here', 'angles', 'always', 'seem', 'just', 'touch', 'off', 'lighting', 'bit', 'too', 'dark', 'bit', 'too', 'light', 'etc', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'basement-budget', 'pictures', 'staffed', 'entirely', 'no-name', 'actors', 'have', 'blown', 'away', 'Shallow', 'Ground', 'recently', 'mind', 'not', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'acting', 'Midnight', 'Skater', 'saying', 'something.Some', 'have', 'opined', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'category', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'definitely', 'movie', 'one', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'number', 'great', 'drinking', 'games', 'serious', 'piece', 'zombie', 'cinema', 'better', 'Day', 'Dead', '2', 'Contagium', 'not', 'much', '*']",Zombie Night

The dialogue in this movie is mind numbingly stupid. Redneck Zombies, Zombie Doom, and Premutos: Lord of the Living Dead were Shakespearian compared to this. The characters were so retarded. Whenever they are barracaded in a room and zombies come in they just stand there not showing any emotion, they don't even try to escape. That part when Derrick slicese that girls throat in front of everybody was so stupid. It wasn't even stupid in a funny way. Everybody just stood there while he murders her and then after he kills her they finally decide to grab him, but they don't kill him they just let him go. I can't stress how stupid this movie is. Its ONLY redeeming quality is that it actualy has some good gore although they didn't use it properly. The gore was well done but it wasn't shocking or entertaining. the wwriters have no idea of how to write. They kill off the guy who should have been the star of the movie. He was the first character introduced and they did the most character development with him and yet they kill him off half way through the movie. And not even his girlfriend survived. She was killed by a zombie in a acrowded room. I guess no one felt like shooting the zombie for her and guess she didn't feel like getting up to walk away from the stumbling zombie. Her boyfriends daughter who is supposed to eight but is actually thirteen just sat right beside her watching her get disemboweled.

When running through a small group of foot dragging zombies, don't run directly into them.I did like the zombie with his leg shot off, eating his own foot.A zombie film worth missing.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity.

This was perhaps the worst film, even by low-budget horror standards, simply for the fact that nothing ruins a production faster than bad acting and bad dialogue. And this film exhibited both. The dialogue, the writing, the acting, especially the lack of character development, which did nothing more than to create an ensemble of pasteboard characters, was so poorly done that I would have to say that this was written by fourth graders for third graders. **Seriously, even if you like low budget horror films no matter how bad they may be, stay away from this one.
