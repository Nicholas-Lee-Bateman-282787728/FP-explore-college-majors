1314921,A2GK7QG6O5OKZ4,B0030AM6XQ,Alan clayton,"[1, 1]","This 2 disc set comprises, in the original transmission order, the first 14 episodes of this hard-hitting, at times brutal, series from 1957. There were eventually well over 100 episodes made over a period of three years. The violence does not seem so extreme now, unlike the propensity for men to wear hats indoors, but the police still do seem to draw revolvers, and use them, with remarkably little provocation. Count Basie's music for the programme was written for the second series, so is not featured here, except in a slightly different arrangement, over the menu card. Marvin, loose -limbed, agile, often gliding like a panther, impresses: he has to play a number of different assumed roles during the course of the episodes, and his ability to suggest different characters through movement and gesture suggests a major star in the making. Interestingly, one episode features a young Angie Dickinson, years before she joined him in the two films whose violence was a natural development of this show, namely The Killers, and Point Blank. So, there is much to enjoy, and this without mentioning the location shooting in Chicago.There are problems. I knew the manufacturers of these discs had not been given access to the original materials, and had been forced to collect prints from varied private sources, so as expected, print quality is very variable, from quite reasonable, to barely tolerable. Some episodes streamed on the Internet seem better. But the real problem was the discs themselves. Both of my Region 1 players from the first refused to play them, and it was only after thoroughly cleaning each disc half a dozen times with three different cleaning materials that I persuaded them to consistently play. Even now they occasionally stick, although they had appeared clean when removed from their packaging. It's a series well worth exploring if you like period film noir, or cop shows, and the half hour stories waste little time, are concise, and well constructed. But be prepared for difficulties.",3,"Great series, dirty discs",1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,2020,"['2', 'disc', 'set', 'comprises', 'original', 'transmission', 'order', 'first', '14', 'episodes', 'hard-hitting', 'times', 'brutal', 'series', '1957', 'were', 'eventually', 'well', '100', 'episodes', 'made', 'period', 'three', 'years', 'violence', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'extreme', 'now', 'propensity', 'men', 'wear', 'hats', 'indoors', 'police', 'still', 'do', 'seem', 'draw', 'revolvers', 'use', 'remarkably', 'little', 'provocation', 'Count', 'Basie', 'music', 'programme', 'was', 'written', 'second', 'series', 'so', 'not', 'featured', 'here', 'slightly', 'different', 'arrangement', 'menu', 'card', 'Marvin', 'loose', '-limbed', 'agile', 'often', 'gliding', 'panther', 'impresses', 'play', 'number', 'different', 'assumed', 'roles', 'course', 'episodes', 'ability', 'suggest', 'different', 'characters', 'movement', 'gesture', 'major', 'star', 'making', 'Interestingly', 'one', 'episode', 'young', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'years', 'joined', 'two', 'films', 'violence', 'was', 'natural', 'development', 'show', 'namely', 'Killers', 'Point', 'Blank', 'So', 'much', 'enjoy', 'mentioning', 'location', 'shooting', 'Chicago.There', 'are', 'problems', 'knew', 'manufacturers', 'discs', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'given', 'access', 'original', 'materials', 'had', 'been', 'forced', 'collect', 'prints', 'varied', 'private', 'sources', 'so', 'expected', 'print', 'quality', 'very', 'variable', 'quite', 'reasonable', 'barely', 'tolerable', 'episodes', 'streamed', 'Internet', 'seem', 'better', 'real', 'problem', 'was', 'discs', 'Region', '1', 'players', 'first', 'refused', 'play', 'was', 'only', 'thoroughly', 'cleaning', 'disc', 'dozen', 'times', 'three', 'different', 'cleaning', 'materials', 'persuaded', 'consistently', 'play', 'Even', 'now', 'occasionally', 'stick', 'had', 'appeared', 'clean', 'when', 'removed', 'packaging', 'series', 'well', 'exploring', 'like', 'period', 'film', 'noir', 'cop', 'shows', 'half', 'hour', 'stories', 'waste', 'little', 'time', 'are', 'concise', 'well', 'constructed', 'be', 'prepared', 'difficulties']",M Squad
