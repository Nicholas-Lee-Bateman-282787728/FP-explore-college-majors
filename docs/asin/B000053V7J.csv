565280,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000053V7J,Micheal Hunt,"[7, 14]","Yahoo Serios made a name for himself when he made the classic Australian comedy &quot;Young Einstein&quot; then he slipped a little, but not completly with &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot;. Both those movies gave Yahoo Serious a well placed name in Australian movie making.Then comes out with this garbage. I was anxious to see this, and made up an excuse to take my nefue and neice to see this movie. And during the entire movie I can testify that I only made the smallest, un-heard &quot;ha&quot; once during the entire film!I remember walking out thinking that that was one of the worst films ever, how it got made I can only guess is that the studio saw Yahoo's name and figured it would probably be as good as his last 2, but what suprises me more is I havent seen it on any top 100 Worst movies of all time lists. So let me be the first to say , it's in my top 20 worst movies of all time.The movie was pathetic, the story had been done a million times before, oh, I got the humour, it just wasnt funny, the out-takes where not at all funny, and most of the time out-takes during the credits are what people stay to watch and laugh at, I was already walking out by that time, the kids wanted to watch them, but nope, still nothing funny at all!If Yahoo ever releases his great comedy &quot;Young Einstein&quot; on DVD? I Recomend you check that out. Its a great comedy that is one of Australias best ever. If he releases &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot; then that one would be OK, but if you have no knowedge of who the real Ned Kelly is? you probably wouldnt get it at all.. but avoid this god awful movie. You dont see many reviews here on it, I wasnt even going to waste my time reveiwing it, but I felt it needed to be said that it is one of the worst movies of all time. well, worst attempts at comedy anyway. Even tho I went &quot;ha&quot; for as long as it took you to read that one time during the film, even the kids themselves only laughed about 5 times.If Yahoo is going to make another movie after this, then he has some serious thinking to do before he makes it, every reveiw in the country at the time gave it a 1 star vote. I wish I had of taken there reveiws as right, for once in my life! Not many times to I see reveiws written and fully agree with them, but I did on this movie, its a 1 star, pethetic attempt from Yahoo who slipped into a deep dark hole with this un-original, seen it before, pethetic attempt at a comedy - he should have stuck to that formula he was doing with fammiluer charactors like in his previous films and re-aranged it to an almost parody like atmosphere which made them funny. This movie had none of that, and failed big time, it flopped in theatres, it flopped in the rentals, and every single reveiw never gave it more then 1 and a half stars, and the ones he gave it a half star more then it deserved are just beeing too kind to Yahoo Serious.",1,"Not one of Australias, but one if the ALL TIME WORST MOVIES",1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,2887,"['Yahoo', 'Serios', 'made', 'name', 'when', 'made', 'classic', 'Australian', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Young', 'Einstein', 'quot', 'then', 'slipped', 'little', 'not', 'completly', 'quot', 'Reckless', 'Kelly', 'quot', 'movies', 'gave', 'Yahoo', 'Serious', 'well', 'placed', 'name', 'Australian', 'movie', 'making.Then', 'out', 'garbage', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'made', 'up', 'excuse', 'take', 'nefue', 'neice', 'see', 'movie', 'entire', 'movie', 'can', 'testify', 'only', 'made', 'smallest', 'un-heard', 'quot', 'quot', 'once', 'entire', 'film', 'remember', 'walking', 'out', 'thinking', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'how', 'got', 'made', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'studio', 'saw', 'Yahoo', 'name', 'figured', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'last', '2', 'what', 'more', 'havent', 'seen', 'top', '100', 'Worst', 'movies', 'time', 'lists', 'So', 'let', 'be', 'first', 'say', 'top', '20', 'worst', 'movies', 'time.The', 'movie', 'was', 'pathetic', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'oh', 'got', 'humour', 'just', 'wasnt', 'funny', 'out-takes', 'where', 'not', 'funny', 'most', 'time', 'out-takes', 'credits', 'are', 'what', 'people', 'stay', 'watch', 'laugh', 'was', 'already', 'walking', 'out', 'time', 'kids', 'wanted', 'watch', 'nope', 'still', 'nothing', 'funny', 'Yahoo', 'ever', 'great', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Young', 'Einstein', 'quot', 'DVD', 'Recomend', 'check', 'out', 'great', 'comedy', 'one', 'Australias', 'best', 'ever', 'quot', 'Reckless', 'Kelly', 'quot', 'then', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'have', 'knowedge', 'who', 'real', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'probably', 'wouldnt', 'get', 'all..', 'avoid', 'god', 'awful', 'movie', 'dont', 'see', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'wasnt', 'even', 'going', 'waste', 'time', 'reveiwing', 'felt', 'needed', 'be', 'said', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'time', 'well', 'worst', 'attempts', 'comedy', 'anyway', 'Even', 'tho', 'went', 'quot', 'quot', 'as', 'long', 'took', 'read', 'one', 'time', 'film', 'even', 'kids', 'only', 'laughed', '5', 'times.If', 'Yahoo', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'then', 'serious', 'thinking', 'do', 'reveiw', 'country', 'time', 'gave', '1', 'star', 'vote', 'wish', 'had', 'taken', 'reveiws', 'right', 'once', 'life', 'Not', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'reveiws', 'written', 'fully', 'agree', 'did', 'movie', '1', 'star', 'pethetic', 'attempt', 'Yahoo', 'who', 'slipped', 'deep', 'dark', 'hole', 'un-original', 'seen', 'pethetic', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'formula', 'was', 'doing', 'fammiluer', 'charactors', 'previous', 'films', 're-aranged', 'almost', 'parody', 'atmosphere', 'made', 'funny', 'movie', 'had', 'none', 'failed', 'big', 'time', 'flopped', 'theatres', 'flopped', 'rentals', 'single', 'reveiw', 'never', 'gave', 'more', 'then', '1', 'half', 'stars', 'ones', 'gave', 'half', 'star', 'more', 'then', 'deserved', 'are', 'just', 'beeing', 'too', 'kind', 'Yahoo', 'Serious']",N/A

565284,A1DZSBTVCJ883,B000053V7J,W. Walker,"[0, 1]","In part, this film is a slapstick comedy in the spirit of the classic silent comedies, Laurel and Hardy, and the Three Stooges, for example. But, it's also a satire on the extreme lengths businesses sometimes resort to to increase their sales, as well as on the too frequent narrow mindedness of parents and others in discouraging imaginative activities in kids and adults. It's also a love story between two wacky, largely brainless, people. Hellen Dallimore, as Sunday Valentine, is perfect as the cute cuddly moll of the boss of the egg processing plant, who discovers she has much more in common with Roger Crumpkin, Mr. Accident, despite his pathological clumsiness and Obsessive Compulsive Dismantling Fixation. North American audiences probably won't get the humour that the egg processing plant has been built in place of the famous bizarre-looking Sydney opera house, only one end of which remains to identify it. The rest of the roof has been reconstructed into several gigantic eggs that dwarf the original opera house. My favorite gag: the self-folding pull out couch bed, with occupant included.I wish this film could be redone, making fuller use of the comedic potential of the main ingredients, deleting scenes that are not important to the main story line or not funny, and ending with a much more meaningful basis of attachment between Roger and Sunday. For example, the side effects of the addictive nicotine-laced eggs could have been played up more.  In addition to suddenly becoming smokers, everyone could have started chewing and spitting tobacco. The egg tycoon suddenly becomes a spitton manufacturer, even selling several to the League Against Tobacco.Sunday  Valentine mostly plays a passive role in Roger's furthur misadventures. She could have played a much more active role in the comedy in the later part of the film. For example, she could have been obsessed with putting mechanical and electrical parts together in novel, but mostly ridiculous, contraptions. Thus, she would perfectly complement Roger, with his Obsessive Compulsive Dismantling Fixation and provide some real glue for their relationship. Eventually, she would come up with an important invention, using parts dismantled by Roger, that provides a happy ending. This could be tied into the flying saucer-hub cap aspect of the story, which is left rather undeveloped, despite its repeated appearance from time to time.  For example, little green men from a Jupiter moon could have landed looking for their lost hub cap for their landing gear. They find it as a crucial part of a pertutual  motion dynamo designed by Sunday that is supplying electricity for the egg plant. Engineers can't duplicate this invention  because the hub cap is made of a metal that doesn't exist on earth. The space visitors sample some of the eggs while recovering their hub cap, making them feel euphoric. They want lots more eggs. Roger and Sunday offer to trade eggs for more hub caps and they agree. These are used to light up the whole city. The aliens fly off to bring back more hub caps, to light up the whole country. Meanwhile, the FDA has banned the sale of the nicotine-laced eggs. Thus, the trade of such eggs for hub caps also saves the egg company from bankrupcy.
