More crazy stuff happend during their 2nd visit, the live episode.  There were creepy voices, pianos playing (us viewers could actually hear these things.) There wasn't just  the usual ""cold spots"" that conveniently no-one at home can feel.This is a cool episode, pretty entertaining.

1088060,AEVDN809UQJHU,B000T28C90,curtis martin,"[9, 32]","You watch it for the people looking for the ghosts! These guys are hilarious! Especially since they take themselves so dang seriously. I've never seen an episode where something happened (or in which someone said something happened) that wasn't totally explicable. And even though they claim to be looking for logical explanations to odd occurances, these guys are all DYING to see/hear ghosts. And it shows! People like to be scared, and they like to think there are ghosts and the guys on this show are no exceptions. If they really wanted to find out what was what, they'd totally empty the house in question, fumigate it, seal it, and have all electrical power cut off to it from the street. Then when they investigate they'd know that they're not hearing rats or people or radios, or picking up electrical magnetic fields from the house's wiring or letting in drafts that are moving doors, etc. in other words, they'd actually do things scientifically.But what fun would that be?Like I say, watching these guys convince themselves that ghostly things are happening when they are not is the entertainment value of the show. A great depiction of how we humans love to fool ourselves.A PS from 2009-- To answer some of the comments on my comment. I should have pointed out that this DVD is fairly typical of the show in general, but not the best representation of it--the ""live"" aspect of the program on this disc, even edited down, reveals the massive amount of time these guys spend doing basically nothing but sitting around bs-ing in the dark. AND I must add that I LOVE the show and am a great fan. I never meant to knock the show, but only meant to send a gentle elbow to those folks who watch it uncritically. The interest I find in GH's is the way it give you the opportunity to observe the way even intelligent people act when isolated in the darkness, hearing sounds they wouldn't have noticed in the daylight and misinterpreting unexpected sources of light and shadows.  Every time the Ghost Hunters experience an odd occurance they can't explain in 20 minutes, they assume there's a good chance that it's supernatural--that's what I find so interesting. The logical thing would be to assume that it's NOT supernatural and keep investigating. Their ""science"" is (how to put this kindly)...faulty. While it's true that they have ""debunked"" quite a few claims, they could easily debunk ALL of them, given the time and outside expertise. For example: EMF readings only read electromagnetic fields--they do not detect ghosts. There are few places in the modern world without electricity these days, so you're always going to find legit emf sources. And all old houses have colder patches at night; no room is the same temp all the way across in either a modern building with HVAC or in an old house with natural drafts. So reading temps proves nothing, despite the totally made-up theory that ""manifestations"" use room heat to manifest. Digital recorders don't record things you didn't hear if you were in the same room when they were set to record; anything strange you hear later on is just odd white noise or transmmissions from any one of hundreds of voice transmission sources. Eliminate those sources before being ""astounded."" All cameras have spherical lenses, and thus all can create spheres from any minute light source (which is why you don't see them with your eyes). And even regular snapshots occasionally have unexplained blobs or blemishes that no one would call ""unexplained and possibly supernatural"" unless they were already looking for something like that. Another interesting point is that, even though the owner of the buildings in question often claim that the spooky stuff they've experiences happens in broad daylight, the investigations always take place in the dark; there's no reason for that other than people's imaginations run wild when they are used to seeing stuff and then can't see anything.I could go on and on. But I don't see my comments as negative as far as the show is concerned. I know that the GH's will never find real evidence of an acutal haunting. BUT they will entertain me endlessly with their good-natured attempts and they will provide me with many hours of insight into the psychology of ""how folks fool they own selves"" as the old saying goes. You COULD staff a show like this with actual professional technical experts who are familiar with the scientific method (like they have on UFO Hunters)but that would ruin the show. The entertainment of GH is that these are regular guys we can identify with.To sum up: GREAT ENTERTAINMENT SHOW (but don't ruin it by taking it as anything else). This disc is ok, but the series dvds are better than this particular special.",3,You Don't Watch this show for Ghosts!,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,4726,"['watch', 'people', 'looking', 'ghosts', 'guys', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Especially', 'take', 'so', 'dang', 'seriously', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'where', 'something', 'happened', 'someone', 'said', 'something', 'happened', 'was', ""n't"", 'totally', 'explicable', 'even', 'claim', 'be', 'looking', 'logical', 'explanations', 'odd', 'occurances', 'guys', 'are', 'DYING', 'see/hear', 'ghosts', 'People', 'be', 'scared', 'like', 'think', 'are', 'ghosts', 'guys', 'show', 'are', 'exceptions', 'really', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'what', ""'d"", 'totally', 'empty', 'house', 'question', 'fumigate', 'seal', 'have', 'electrical', 'power', 'cut', 'off', 'street', 'Then', 'when', 'investigate', ""'d"", 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'hearing', 'rats', 'people', 'radios', 'picking', 'up', 'electrical', 'magnetic', 'fields', 'house', 'wiring', 'letting', 'drafts', 'are', 'moving', 'doors', 'etc', 'other', 'words', ""'d"", 'actually', 'do', 'things', 'scientifically.But', 'what', 'fun', 'would', 'be', 'say', 'watching', 'guys', 'convince', 'ghostly', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'entertainment', 'value', 'show', 'great', 'depiction', 'how', 'humans', 'love', 'fool', 'ourselves.A', 'PS', '2009', 'answer', 'comments', 'comment', 'should', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'typical', 'show', 'general', 'not', 'best', 'representation', 'live', 'aspect', 'program', 'disc', 'even', 'edited', 'down', 'massive', 'amount', 'time', 'guys', 'spend', 'doing', 'basically', 'nothing', 'sitting', 'around', 'bs-ing', 'dark', 'must', 'add', 'LOVE', 'show', 'am', 'great', 'fan', 'never', 'meant', 'knock', 'show', 'only', 'meant', 'send', 'gentle', 'elbow', 'folks', 'who', 'watch', 'uncritically', 'interest', 'find', 'GH', 'way', 'give', 'opportunity', 'observe', 'way', 'even', 'intelligent', 'people', 'act', 'when', 'isolated', 'darkness', 'hearing', 'sounds', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'noticed', 'daylight', 'misinterpreting', 'unexpected', 'sources', 'light', 'shadows', 'time', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'experience', 'odd', 'occurance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', '20', 'minutes', 'assume', 'good', 'chance', 'supernatural', 'what', 'find', 'so', 'interesting', 'logical', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'assume', 'NOT', 'supernatural', 'keep', 'investigating', 'science', 'how', 'put', 'kindly', 'faulty', 'true', 'have', 'debunked', 'quite', 'few', 'claims', 'could', 'easily', 'debunk', 'ALL', 'given', 'time', 'outside', 'expertise', 'example', 'EMF', 'only', 'read', 'electromagnetic', 'fields', 'do', 'not', 'detect', 'ghosts', 'are', 'few', 'places', 'modern', 'world', 'electricity', 'days', ""'re"", 'always', 'going', 'find', 'legit', 'emf', 'sources', 'old', 'houses', 'have', 'colder', 'patches', 'night', 'room', 'same', 'temp', 'way', 'modern', 'building', 'HVAC', 'old', 'house', 'natural', 'drafts', 'So', 'reading', 'temps', 'nothing', 'totally', 'made-up', 'theory', 'manifestations', 'use', 'room', 'heat', 'manifest', 'Digital', 'recorders', 'do', ""n't"", 'record', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'were', 'same', 'room', 'when', 'were', 'set', 'record', 'anything', 'strange', 'hear', 'later', 'just', 'odd', 'white', 'noise', 'transmmissions', 'one', 'hundreds', 'voice', 'transmission', 'sources', 'Eliminate', 'sources', 'being', 'astounded', 'cameras', 'have', 'spherical', 'lenses', 'thus', 'can', 'create', 'spheres', 'minute', 'light', 'source', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'eyes', 'even', 'regular', 'snapshots', 'occasionally', 'have', 'unexplained', 'blobs', 'blemishes', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'unexplained', 'possibly', 'supernatural', 'were', 'already', 'looking', 'something', 'interesting', 'point', 'even', 'owner', 'buildings', 'question', 'often', 'spooky', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'experiences', 'broad', 'daylight', 'investigations', 'always', 'take', 'place', 'dark', 'reason', 'other', 'people', 'imaginations', 'run', 'wild', 'when', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'stuff', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything.I', 'could', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'comments', 'as', 'negative', 'far', 'show', 'concerned', 'know', 'GH', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'real', 'evidence', 'acutal', 'haunting', 'BUT', 'will', 'entertain', 'endlessly', 'good-natured', 'attempts', 'will', 'provide', 'many', 'hours', 'insight', 'psychology', 'how', 'folks', 'fool', 'own', 'selves', 'old', 'saying', 'COULD', 'staff', 'show', 'actual', 'professional', 'technical', 'experts', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'scientific', 'method', 'have', 'UFO', 'Hunters', 'would', 'ruin', 'show', 'entertainment', 'GH', 'are', 'regular', 'guys', 'can', 'identify', 'with.To', 'sum', 'GREAT', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'SHOW', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'taking', 'anything', 'else', 'disc', 'ok', 'series', 'dvds', 'are', 'better', 'particular', 'special']",Ghost Hunters: Live from ''The Shining'' Hotel

1088062,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000T28C90,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[3, 4]","GHOST HUNTERS LIVEFROM THE STANLEY HOTELI have been a fan of this show since it first debuted and have been watching it since following Ghost Hunters Jay and Grant into the unknown. For those who don't know this show is about a group of professionals in the paranormal field [if there is such a thing they are closest] who using the latest in technology go from haunting to haunting searching for or disproving the paranormal at each place. The show is highly successful spawning two spin off shows like Ghost Hunters International and the upcoming Ghost Hunters Academy.For the first live show the Hunters returned to one of the sites that gave them the most activity, The Stanley Hotel. This is the legendary hotel that Stephen King once stayed in and based stories after what he had seen here. So it seems a logical choice for the first live show since it is a proven hot spot for paranormal activity. This time around pro wrestler CM Punk is along for the ride and seems like he is ready for anything to happen.This DVD is basically the episode after the live one that was the edited version with the analyzing and reveal of everything that they found. Still this is an excellent DVD that is a wonderful addition to the collection at home of every season. Jay and Grant as usual come off as the most professional but every one else seems really into to find something so it is entertaining. There are some really great moments that happen during this investigation like when Jay and Grant are down in a tunnel, CREEPY.I own all of the DVD sets and such and watch every episode on SyFy so I highly recommend this show if you are into things like this. I am a big fan and I think you would be to if you were to watch it.

Still, I've watched this 3-hour DVD several times.  Not much happens, as usual.  The team finds a lot of cold spots, but you will in late October in the Rockies -- and some of the sounds they are tracing around the hotel could be attributed to heating coming on or even by mistake as Donna points out, the air conditioners.  Jason and Grant pretty much sequester themselves in the basement where they hear sounds that excite them into believing they've found a haunting, but they just sound like animals to me -- racoons or cats make similar sounds.  They fail to question this, so I sometimes believe that they pretend to be deceived just to enliven the show.  The investigating team is a good mix, but I wonder why the addition of a celebrity wrestler to help investigate.  Wouldn't it have been more worthwhile to have one or more scientists on board to lend some credibility?  For all that Jason stresses the science behind the investigations, the fact that none of these guys has any scientific background, thus little critical thinking skills, is brought home.  For instance, Steve hears murmuring in an adjacent room and is startled.  Yet might it be the heaters blowing air through filters, which can moan and rattle, and not ghosts talking?  Doesn't occur to him, and the new guy, Tango, is always willing to believe he's come upon a ghost, so much so that when he hears a strange sound or feels an odd sensation, he magnifies it into being a ghost.  He's funny.  Lisa is in this one, and she's the most grounded of them, as well as very serious about her investigating, which makes her as much of an asset as Brian.  Also, as a negative, the teams often stand around chatting, especially about personal info, rather than roaming about investigating.  It doesn't seem like they're that interested in finding any evidence.  However, I still enjoyed the presentation.  When the lights go out and the display goes to black and white, it's like a B-movie.

I saw the originalinvestigation at the Stanley, and me and my wife were reallylooking forward to this.My review overall is 2 stars.The reason is because this DVDis sloppy.  The investigation was sloppy.  The integraton ofa wrestler who anounces at the beginning that he is""into this kind of stuff"" in an unenthusiastic voice sets thescene.  It was a sloppy decision to include him.  Almost as sloppyas the editing.Jay and Grant stumble on some interesting activity.  The girlsteam lead by Donna LeCroix is professional and make expositionalremarks so  the audience understands what is happening withoutit being too 'play school'The biggest problems are everything else! ..* Brian and Steve amount to nothing more than a comedy duoas the presence of Live TV (""I feel like I am being watched"") makesthem uncomfortable and continue to talk non-stop and say sillythings, the best being Brian's theory of a woman exploding mid-airto explain a cold-spot high in the air.  I know Jay must havesighed when he watched this DVD back.* Dustin who does nothing except pose and walk around likea primate - quite possibly the only TAPS member who is completelyuseless and thinks hot girls sit around to watch the show for him.* The absence of Andy Andrews - where did he go?  Awesome investigatorwho could have brought more legitimacy to this poor investigation.* CR Punk, a wrestler who seems to occasionally disappear from theinvestigation, only for the audience to realise he is laying aroundon the beds of each room.

There was alot of overreacting to sounds and sensations that they wouldn't have seemed to have done on the regular show. As one reviewer stated, maybe it was to try to infuse some excitement to the show. The only problem was that it tended to make it seem fake. This seemed most true when Jason and Grant were in the basement hearing what seemed to be a woman saying ""hello"". Their usual skepticism wasn't there (I.E - it could be an animal or with all the pipes under the building perhaps it was someone in a room somewhere) they went immediately to it being a ghost. A wrestler as a special guest? What were they thinking? This added nothing to the show (unless you are a wrestling fan). I found this to be a negative influence to the show more than a positive one. Although this was far from the best of their shows, I am a fan to the show and the theme and can give them no less than 3 stars.",3,Not at their best,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,976,"['live', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'usual', 'par', 'interest', 'curiosity', 'was', 'alot', 'overreacting', 'sounds', 'sensations', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'seemed', 'have', 'done', 'regular', 'show', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'maybe', 'was', 'try', 'infuse', 'excitement', 'show', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'tended', 'make', 'seem', 'fake', 'seemed', 'most', 'true', 'when', 'Jason', 'Grant', 'were', 'basement', 'hearing', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'woman', 'saying', 'hello', 'usual', 'skepticism', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'I.E', 'could', 'be', 'animal', 'pipes', 'building', 'perhaps', 'was', 'someone', 'room', 'somewhere', 'went', 'immediately', 'being', 'ghost', 'wrestler', 'special', 'guest', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'added', 'nothing', 'show', 'are', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'found', 'be', 'negative', 'influence', 'show', 'more', 'positive', 'one', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'shows', 'am', 'fan', 'show', 'theme', 'can', 'give', 'less', '3', 'stars']",Ghost Hunters: Live from ''The Shining'' Hotel
