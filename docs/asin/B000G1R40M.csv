There was something really magically about this season despite the fact that every time you saw Entertainment Tonight it was speculating if the character was coming out the closet or not for an entire year of news coverage. That was the news that was covered all year round till the final infamous coming out episode. It was INSANE the news COVERAGE! Season 3 was really great also and overall this was just a great show. But something really magical about the comedy and the way the CREW just clicked made this season great and stand out from the rest. The storyline were funny and crazy also. Ellen's sense of HUMOR is just on POINT in this season. The relationship between Paige & Spence was also what made the series so great. The plots in this season was so do different as Ellen's world starts to just crumble from the announcement of her parents divorce to Ellen seeing a therapist. Unfortunately this would be the last time Ellen would be FUNNY! Season 5 was such a letdown and i have to agree it deserved to get cancel. I felt the storylines were not tackled well in terms of Ellen being a lesbian on the show. All the jokes seem to lose its magic. I guess COMEDY is better when it's based on speculation rather then the truth being revealed. Season 5 is still a must own for any fan but in all honesty it's a HUGE let down. After the stellar coming out episode in season 4 i was so looking forward to season 5 being 100 times better. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. I also didn't like the relationship between Ellen and her Girlfriend character on the show. They really should have cast someone else that had more chemistry with Ellen. Get this season before it goes out of PRINT. You'll laugh till you CRY and watching these episodes brings back many wonderful memories of the 90's.,5,The SEASON where everything WORKS!!!!!,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,1862,"['was', 'best', 'Ellen', 'series', '5', 'year', 'run', 'was', 'something', 'really', 'magically', 'season', 'fact', 'time', 'saw', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight', 'was', 'speculating', 'character', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'closet', 'not', 'entire', 'year', 'news', 'coverage', 'was', 'news', 'was', 'covered', 'year', 'round', 'final', 'infamous', 'coming', 'out', 'episode', 'was', 'INSANE', 'news', 'COVERAGE', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'also', 'overall', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'show', 'something', 'really', 'magical', 'comedy', 'way', 'CREW', 'just', 'clicked', 'made', 'season', 'great', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'storyline', 'were', 'funny', 'crazy', 'also', 'Ellen', 'sense', 'HUMOR', 'just', 'POINT', 'season', 'relationship', 'Paige', 'Spence', 'was', 'also', 'what', 'made', 'series', 'so', 'great', 'plots', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'do', 'different', 'Ellen', 'world', 'just', 'crumble', 'announcement', 'parents', 'divorce', 'Ellen', 'seeing', 'therapist', 'Unfortunately', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'Ellen', 'would', 'be', 'FUNNY', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'such', 'letdown', 'i', 'have', 'agree', 'deserved', 'get', 'cancel', 'felt', 'storylines', 'were', 'not', 'tackled', 'well', 'terms', 'Ellen', 'being', 'lesbian', 'show', 'jokes', 'seem', 'lose', 'magic', 'guess', 'COMEDY', 'better', 'when', 'based', 'speculation', 'rather', 'then', 'truth', 'being', 'revealed', 'Season', '5', 'still', 'must', 'own', 'fan', 'honesty', 'HUGE', 'let', 'down', 'stellar', 'coming', 'out', 'episode', 'season', '4', 'i', 'was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'season', '5', 'being', '100', 'times', 'better', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'relationship', 'Ellen', 'Girlfriend', 'character', 'show', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'cast', 'someone', 'else', 'had', 'more', 'chemistry', 'Ellen', 'Get', 'season', 'PRINT', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'till', 'CRY', 'watching', 'episodes', 'brings', 'back', 'many', 'wonderful', 'memories', '90']",Ellen - The Complete Season Four

998391,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000G1R40M,James Hiller,"[10, 11]","Ten years ago, Ellen was a mid rated comedy, a ""female Seinfeld"" it was once described, about a group of friends living and loving in L.A. Season threeEllen - The Complete Season Threehit its peak, with one of the funniest hour long episodes in the history of sitcoms, Paige's wedding. And then came the infamous season four, with the even more infamous hour on television ""The Puppy Episode"", which galvanized and turned the nation on its ear, and became the birthmother, intentionally or not.I purchased season four of Ellen primarily to relive those days gone past, and see if the Puppy Episode held up to the previous ""genius"" season. And the good news is, it did. With all of the ""Ellen is gay"" hype gone, and the public thinking of her as more of a Oscar host and congenial television hostess, the episode stands alone now. The thing that is quickly apparent is how personal this show was to Ellen, as she herself comes out of the closet nationally, as her character comes out to her small group of friends. Both make significant impacts on their worlds, but Ellen's world was totally rocked. As she talks with counselor Oprah, she is both Ellen and Ellen Morgan, discussing and divulging the pain of coming out to millions of people who may have never realized how hard it is.And what is even more surprising is how personal I took the show. It harkened me back to a time where I was struggling with these issues such as Ellen. I didn't take the time, surprisingly, to appreciate how similar she and I were, and how our shared experiences were so revolutionary. The episode itself was proof on how far we've come baby, and how far we have to go still.Other than ""the episode"", the entire season plays out well. Many funny episodes are included in this collection, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud from one to another. You can't help but feel that each episode is bringing you one step closer to THE episode. And once that hits, you know you've just fallen into a new, and somewhat different show.Ellen was courageous, and full of conviction to do what she did, when she did. Bravo to our funny lady, and thank you for teaching us, and taking us on an incredible ride.",5,"Classic, even ten years later",1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,2184,"['Ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Ellen', 'was', 'mid', 'rated', 'comedy', 'female', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'once', 'described', 'group', 'friends', 'living', 'loving', 'L.A', 'Season', 'threeEllen', 'Complete', 'Season', 'Threehit', 'peak', 'one', 'funniest', 'hour', 'long', 'history', 'sitcoms', 'Paige', 'wedding', 'then', 'came', 'infamous', 'season', 'four', 'even', 'more', 'infamous', 'hour', 'television', 'Puppy', 'Episode', 'galvanized', 'turned', 'nation', 'ear', 'became', 'birthmother', 'intentionally', 'not.I', 'purchased', 'season', 'four', 'Ellen', 'primarily', 'relive', 'days', 'gone', 'past', 'see', 'Puppy', 'Episode', 'held', 'up', 'previous', 'genius', 'season', 'good', 'news', 'did', 'Ellen', 'gay', 'hype', 'gone', 'public', 'thinking', 'more', 'Oscar', 'host', 'congenial', 'television', 'hostess', 'episode', 'alone', 'now', 'thing', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'how', 'personal', 'show', 'was', 'Ellen', 'closet', 'nationally', 'character', 'out', 'small', 'group', 'friends', 'make', 'significant', 'impacts', 'worlds', 'Ellen', 'world', 'was', 'totally', 'rocked', 'counselor', 'Oprah', 'Ellen', 'Ellen', 'Morgan', 'discussing', 'divulging', 'pain', 'coming', 'out', 'millions', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'realized', 'how', 'hard', 'is.And', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'surprising', 'how', 'personal', 'took', 'show', 'harkened', 'back', 'time', 'where', 'was', 'struggling', 'issues', 'such', 'Ellen', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'surprisingly', 'appreciate', 'how', 'similar', 'were', 'how', 'shared', 'experiences', 'were', 'so', 'revolutionary', 'episode', 'was', 'proof', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'baby', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'go', 'still.Other', 'episode', 'entire', 'season', 'out', 'well', 'Many', 'funny', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'find', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'episode', 'bringing', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'episode', 'once', 'hits', 'know', ""'ve"", 'just', 'fallen', 'new', 'somewhat', 'different', 'show.Ellen', 'was', 'courageous', 'full', 'conviction', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'when', 'did', 'Bravo', 'funny', 'lady', 'thank', 'teaching', 'taking', 'incredible', 'ride']",Ellen - The Complete Season Four
