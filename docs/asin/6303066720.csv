If you want a somewhat decent comedy then I can recommend it, though not very highly. If however, you want to know something of the story Dumas wrote then please either buy the book and let someone else waste their money on this DVD or, If you do want a movie of this story then I can recommend the dual DVD of the Three/Four Musketeers starring  Michael York/Oliver Reed/Raquel Welsh is much, much closer to the written work.Probably one of the more glaring examples is that this DVD contains a plot by Cardinal Richelieu to assassinate the King on his 16th birthday. In the book Dumas wrote the King and Queen were in their thirties, and there was no assassination plot at all, although the Cardinal was trying to discredit the Queen by exposing a love affair between her and the English Duke of Buckingham - a rather one sided thing not readily returned by the Queen.",1,The Three What???,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1109,"['give', 'DVD', '1', 'star', 'impossible', 'give', 'less.This', 'movie', 'version', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'book', 'written', 'Alexander', 'Dumas', 'same', 'way', 'Broadway', 'show', 'Cats', '1957', 'movie', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'want', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'comedy', 'then', 'can', 'recommend', 'not', 'very', 'highly', 'however', 'want', 'know', 'something', 'story', 'Dumas', 'wrote', 'then', 'please', 'buy', 'book', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'waste', 'money', 'DVD', 'do', 'want', 'movie', 'story', 'then', 'can', 'recommend', 'dual', 'DVD', 'Three/Four', 'Musketeers', 'starring', 'Michael', 'York/Oliver', 'Reed/Raquel', 'Welsh', 'much', 'much', 'closer', 'written', 'work.Probably', 'one', 'more', 'glaring', 'examples', 'DVD', 'plot', 'Cardinal', 'Richelieu', 'assassinate', 'King', '16th', 'birthday', 'book', 'Dumas', 'wrote', 'King', 'Queen', 'were', 'thirties', 'was', 'assassination', 'plot', 'Cardinal', 'was', 'trying', 'discredit', 'Queen', 'exposing', 'love', 'affair', 'English', 'Duke', 'Buckingham', 'rather', 'one', 'sided', 'thing', 'not', 'readily', 'returned', 'Queen']",The Three Musketeers Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS

The starring cast consist of Keifer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, Tim Curry, and Rebecca De Mornay.  Not only was the cast incredible, the title track All For Love is performed by Sting, Bryan Adams, and Rod Stewart.  Can you imagine the cost of making this movie today?This movie resonates the very essence of Action Film.  The fighting, racing horses, and dueling almost never end. Did I mention this was an action film?  The violence in this film is more by implication than gruesome portrayals of death and fighting.Add to the action a high dose of comedy.  Oliver Platt is hilarious as Porthos.  Tim Curry adds whit and humor to the evil character of Cardinal Richelieu.The Three Musketeers was filmed on location in Europe which adds a believability that allows the viewer to be swept away into the story.

I am not going to say that Alexandre Dumas must be spinning in his grave. Rather, anybody associated with the film should be tarred, feathered, and finally quartered. Spare no one. As for the erroneous information displayed in the film, I must respectfully point out a couple of them. One, you can't make a cardinal a king no matter what. He has no rightful claim to the throne. His duty is to church and only the church. If the king passes away, then the queen takes over. If she is dead, then the brother of the king or whoever is legally granted the right. But the cardinal? Impossible. Two, Anne of Austria was married to the King of France to create an alliance between Spain and France, not Austria and France...jeez. Get the facts straight. I am not going to bother with the inaccuracies of the story presented in the film because it is too obvious that the movie isn't about The Three Musketeers. While at it, why bother titling the movie The Three Musketeers if it bears no resemblance to the novel? The cast is horribly wrong for each of the characters; it's just a blasphemy. The fencing is the stuff of boredom and bad schooling. In the book, the overused slogan is only uttered once and never again, but in the film, it became obscenely too much for me.

Wrong! I'm so glad I previewed this film first, because there is so much sexual innuendo and sensuality here, especially for a Disney film. In addition, Aramis (Charlie Sheen), is the gastliest character of the bunch because of his so-called ""priestly"" role! In one scene of note, Aramis shows little restraint as a young lady throws herself on him as he's quoting bible verses to her. He then backs-off for a moment, seemingly bringing some sense to a ""steamy"" situation. But that did'nt last more than a few seconds before a complete role-reversal takes place where he starts to lead the advance, all the while justifying it with pseudo-religious quotes.As a discerning parent, this is not the kind of film I want my kids to watch.

The movie has a lot  of action but does not possess the excitement of the Gene kelly and  Chamberlain versions. Chris O'Donnel's heavy American accent immediatley  detracts from the realism needed to enjoy this film. D'Artagnan is supposed  to be French,you know. A diction coach should have at least tried to make  his accent neutral. The costumes are fantastic as well as the scenery, but  these aren't sufficient to make the film memorable. The swordfight  choreography stinks, but of course, nothing can top Gene Kelly's classic  swordplay. The only redeeming factor is Tim Curry's performance as  Richelieu.

This often remade classic is more comedic in this version. I personally liked it. But then I have liked most versions in their style. The 1973 version with Oliver Reed as Athos and this version with Keifer Sutherland as Athos stand out above the rest in my humble opinion. The 1973 version for the drama and this one for the comedy.Tim Curry is marvelous as Cardinal Richelieu. He is so borderline outrageously lecherous you think he is going to burst out laughing like a madman or go into song from &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. He never plays the piety like Charlton Heston did in the 1973 version. He goes more for the deviousness of an outright power mad religious leader.The entire cast is great. With Charlie Sheen, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, and Rebecca DeMornay how could it be anything but well acted. I would bet the entire cast had a great time filming this version. The dramatic parts with DeMornay as Lady DeWinter are quite touching and the comedic parts with Porthos the Pirate, played by Platt, are quite funny. I was impressed with Stephen Herek's direction.Disney did a great job of transferring this movie to DVD. The DVD picture and sound quality is first class. The DVD includes a featurette, theatrical trailers, and Bios.

354260,AE42JLYPXUI45,6303066720,"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)""","[2, 3]","In 1993, Walt Disney had produced another hit movie entitled, THE THREE MUSKETEERS. This is film that is definitely for all ages and up, and it is extremely enjoyable.RICHELIEU (played by Tim Curry) is the Carnial of France. He is in cohoots with ROCHEFORT (played by Michael Wincott), and they plan to kill the King of France. Their first mission was to fire the King's musketeers. All the musketeers have turned in their capes, all but three: ATHOS (played by Kiefer Sutherland), ARAMIS (played by Charlie Sheen), & PORTHOS (played by Oliver Platt). Seems as though they do not want to give up on their royal leader.Arriving in France is the young and courageous, D'ARTAGNAN (played by Chris O'Donnell). He has arrived to join the musketeers, since his late father was a musketeer until he was murdered. As he enters, he meets the beautiful CONSTANCE (played by Julie Delpy), as well as meeting Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Each of them challenge him to a fight. His fight with Athos isn't until 12:00 pm. His fight with Porthos isn't until 1:00 pm. His fight with Aramis isn't until 2:00 pm. D'Artagnan shows up to his fight with Athos, to which Porthos and Aramis show up as well, where they reveal their true identity to the young D'Artagnan: They are musketeers. Some of the Cardinal's men come along, forcing the musketeers and D'Artagnan into battle. Realizng who D'Artagnan's father was, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis decide to let D'Artagnan help them out in this little battle, but soon after, they ditch him, where he is captured and brought into the hands of Cardinal Richelieu.He overhears a conversation between Richelieu and the beautiful LADY DE WINTER (played by Rebecca de Mornay), where they plan to not only kill the King of France, but to kill the Queen as well, where Richelieu and Lady will be King & Queen. Richelieu forces D'Artagnan to reveal the whereabouts of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, but he refuses since he has know clue, to which he adds, ""...And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you..."" Richelieu orders that D'Artagnan be decapitated. The two beheaders are actually...Aramis and Porthos. They are here to rescue their young recruiter.That night, D'Artagnan wanders off alone, after being wounded. Seems as though his wound is only superficial. He is rescued by Lady De Winter, only so she can kill him. But he stops her, to which she and some guards take him off on a boat, where Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are awaiting to rescue him once more, which leads Lady De Winter into killing herself.The morning has arrived where the King and Rochefort plan to go through with their plan, but Athos, Porthos, and Aramis have recruited the rest of the musketeers, with the help of D'Artagnan to protect their royal leader. Rochefort was killed by D'Artagnan, with the help of Constance, since Rocherfort had killed D'Artagnan's father. The Cardinal was placed under rest for treason and attemped murder. For saving his life, the King asks what it is that D'Artagnan wants in return. His request: to become a musketeer. And a musketeer D'Artagnan becomes.I have really enjoyed this film. Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, and Oliver Platt were picture perfect choices for Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Chris O'Donnell, in my opinion was a bad choice for D'Artagnan. The other three were rugged looking, with long hair and goatee's, while Chris O'Donnell has a young baby face. Tim Curry and Michael Wincott make me wanna grab a bottle of Pepto, because their acting makes me sick and I dislike them both. But this movie was thoroughly enjoyable and I strongly recommend to everybody.",5,The Three Musketeers (1993),1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,3603,"['1993', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', 'produced', 'hit', 'movie', 'entitled', 'THREE', 'MUSKETEERS', 'film', 'definitely', 'ages', 'up', 'extremely', 'enjoyable.RICHELIEU', 'played', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Carnial', 'France', 'cohoots', 'ROCHEFORT', 'played', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'plan', 'kill', 'King', 'France', 'first', 'mission', 'was', 'fire', 'King', 'musketeers', 'musketeers', 'have', 'turned', 'capes', 'three', 'ATHOS', 'played', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'ARAMIS', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'PORTHOS', 'played', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'royal', 'leader.Arriving', 'France', 'young', 'courageous', ""D'ARTAGNAN"", 'played', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'arrived', 'join', 'musketeers', 'late', 'father', 'was', 'musketeer', 'was', 'murdered', 'beautiful', 'CONSTANCE', 'played', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'as', 'well', 'meeting', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis', 'challenge', 'fight', 'fight', 'Athos', ""n't"", '12:00', 'pm', 'fight', 'Porthos', ""n't"", '1:00', 'pm', 'fight', 'Aramis', ""n't"", '2:00', 'pm', ""D'Artagnan"", 'up', 'fight', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis', 'show', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'reveal', 'true', 'identity', 'young', ""D'Artagnan"", 'are', 'musketeers', 'Cardinal', 'men', 'come', 'along', 'forcing', 'musketeers', ""D'Artagnan"", 'battle', 'Realizng', 'who', ""D'Artagnan"", 'father', 'was', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis', 'decide', 'let', ""D'Artagnan"", 'help', 'out', 'little', 'battle', 'soon', 'ditch', 'where', 'captured', 'brought', 'hands', 'Cardinal', 'Richelieu.He', 'conversation', 'Richelieu', 'beautiful', 'LADY', 'DE', 'WINTER', 'played', 'Rebecca', 'de', 'Mornay', 'where', 'plan', 'not', 'only', 'kill', 'King', 'France', 'kill', 'Queen', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'Richelieu', 'Lady', 'will', 'be', 'King', 'Queen', 'Richelieu', 'forces', ""D'Artagnan"", 'reveal', 'whereabouts', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis', 'know', 'clue', 'even', 'did', 'would', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Richelieu', 'orders', ""D'Artagnan"", 'be', 'decapitated', 'two', 'beheaders', 'are', 'actually', 'Aramis', 'Porthos', 'are', 'here', 'rescue', 'young', 'recruiter.That', 'night', ""D'Artagnan"", 'alone', 'being', 'wounded', 'wound', 'only', 'superficial', 'rescued', 'Lady', 'De', 'Winter', 'only', 'can', 'kill', 'guards', 'take', 'off', 'boat', 'where', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis', 'are', 'awaiting', 'rescue', 'once', 'more', 'Lady', 'De', 'Winter', 'killing', 'herself.The', 'morning', 'arrived', 'where', 'King', 'Rochefort', 'plan', 'go', 'plan', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis', 'have', 'recruited', 'rest', 'musketeers', 'help', ""D'Artagnan"", 'protect', 'royal', 'leader', 'Rochefort', 'was', 'killed', ""D'Artagnan"", 'help', 'Constance', 'Rocherfort', 'had', 'killed', ""D'Artagnan"", 'father', 'Cardinal', 'was', 'placed', 'rest', 'treason', 'attemped', 'murder', 'saving', 'life', 'King', 'what', ""D'Artagnan"", 'return', 'request', 'become', 'musketeer', 'musketeer', ""D'Artagnan"", 'becomes.I', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'were', 'picture', 'perfect', 'choices', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'opinion', 'was', 'bad', 'choice', ""D'Artagnan"", 'other', 'three', 'were', 'rugged', 'looking', 'long', 'hair', 'goatee', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'young', 'baby', 'face', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'make', 'wan', 'grab', 'bottle', 'Pepto', 'acting', 'sick', 'dislike', 'movie', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'everybody']",The Three Musketeers Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS
354261,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,6303066720,Charismatic Creature,"[11, 27]","A simply terrible, limp, half-hearted, &quot;joke-y&quot; remake of The Three Musketeers that simply did not need to be remade. There is an excellent version by Richard Lester (with Raquel Welch, Oliver Reed etc.) which is not dated at all and has wonderful performances and equisite sets and costumes...it is also extremely funny.So the only motivation here must have been the BUCKS...a remake with Brat Packer stars like Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen. The script is wretched and the jokes stale, TV-type and not very funny. Completely out of period and needless to say unfaithful in the extreme to the spirit of the book.It isn't often you need to specifically mention BAD COSTUMES as ruining a film....either they are splendid (as in Lester's Three/Four Musketeers) or not worth mentioning at all. Here one simply has to mention how awful they are! They don't look the least bit authentic, and the female characters are clearly dressed in clothes from another century, and not the 17th either. Polyester positively gleams and many characters are in clothing that is obviously the wrong size. The only thing I could guess is that the producers were unwilling to make a full complement of period costumes for a movie with such a big cast, and raided some cheap-o wardrobe rental place for items. Even the female leads look cheaply dressed and tacky.Anything good at all to say? Michael Wincott (Rochefort) and Rebecca DeMornary were clearly not warned that this was a frivolous silly project, so they actually ACT and turn in sincere performances that would have worked well in a REAL movie. This despite appalling costumes and hairdoes -- Wincott in glitter and DeMornay with a beehive hairdo that has to be see to be believed.Everybody else clearly got that this was a big joke and made off with their paychecks. Tim Curry chews the scenery like a rapid dog and everybody else seems half asleep.If you have the faintest self-respect and enjoyment of the The Three Musketeers, rent the 70s Lester version.

354265,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,6303066720,CodeMaster Talon,"[2, 3]","While not the most faithful of adaptions, this Disney version of the oft-filmed Dumas classic IS entertaining and surprisingly well-acted (except by O'Donnell, but we'll get to that in a minute).The object here was obviously to provide solid family entertainment based on a familar story, &quot;Disneyfying&quot; the darker aspects of the story and acted out by performers who were concious of the B nature of the production.However, no one seems to have informed Keifer Sutherland or Rebecca DeMornay of the jokiness of the project; they both turn in intense, startling performances that raise the quality of the film several notches above typical live-action Disney fare. Sutherland, in particular, deserves accolades: In my opnion he comes the closest of any actor ever to nailing the Athos of the book, and I am including the revered 1970's film version in this statement. Sutherland manages to be brooding, tortured, violent while simultaneaously letting the audience glimpse the vunerablity underneath the surface of the most interesting and complex of the Musketeers.DeMornay is his match in their few scenes together, while not the Lady DeWinter of the book (this DeWinter is ultimately remorseful) she has a strong presence and great chemistry with Sutherland. They make you believe in their long-buried love, and the final scene with them together is a thunderbolt.The rest of the cast ranges from good (Sheen, surprisingly) to adaquate (everyone else). The one exception is O'Donell; he is just plain bad. Why does he have a career? He can't act, is not fun to watch and not even very goodlooking. I wish he would stop ruining movies with his presence. If you don't mind O'Donell, you are almost sure to enjoy this movie, as he and the second rate production values are its only faults.All in all, a decent rendition of a remarkable book, and very entertaining for a wide range of people. And as for Sutherland, well, with his show &quot;24&quot; the world is finally taking note of what many of us saw in this film.

I also have no problem letting my kids watch this movie . There are some subtle innuendos but they never crossed the line in my opinion to the point where most kids would even have a frame of reference in which to understand them. But, to each his own, I'm more concerned about gratuitous violence in a movie than innuendos of the sort found in this film.I thought the actors and actresses did a perfectly fine job for the type of movie that it is (an entertaining light film with just enough tension in it, like that big ugly guy in the prison), in particular I thought Oliver Platt as Porthos was particularly entertaining and of course Tim Curry was excellent in his role as Cardinel Richelieu and Michael Wincott as Rochefort was an excellent secondary villain.I've watched this movie many many times already and it's one of those that we pull off the shelf from time to time to watch as a family, along with other standby's like ""The Princess Bride"",  ""Robin Hood Men In Tights"" and ""The Holy Grail"".I would also like to say that I thought those folks who recommended the earlier version of ""the Three Musketeers"" w/ Michael York, Rachel Welch etc. were also right on the money!

354271,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,6303066720,DonAthos,"[5, 8]","I'll do my best to make this review fair. It will be hard, because I dearly love the Musketeers novels, and this movie has very little in common with any of those.As my title suggests, most of the names are spot-on accurate... but that's almost where the similarity between this film and its source material ends. A few bits are also retained, and some general characterizations (Athos drinks, etc.), but the actual plot events are completely done away with, as are the deeper portrayals of character. Richelieu is no longer the genius, subtle, behind-doors politician, but becomes Snidely Whiplash v.2.0. Constance Bonacieux loses her last name, her husband, her lines, her importance to the plot, and is thrown in as an afterthought. The Musketeers themselves lose a considerable amount of depth and vigor -- Oliver Platt is hardly the jolly giant that Porthos needs to be (instead presented as mostly a clown, here), and D'Artagnan himself becomes an unsteady, uncertain child instead of the fearless, reckless, arrogant and hot-tempered youth of the novel.All of this said... the movie is... decent. It's fun enough, I suppose, to see guys sword fighting, spilling out one-liners in true 90s film fashion. Rebecca de Mornay is beautiful (and is an inspired casting decision, regardless of how they treated her character), Tim Curry plays Whiplashelieu to the hilt, and Kiefer Sutherland is an ideal Athos.If a person comes to this movie with no knowledge of the novel, or is able to somehow forget it, they'll probably be entertained. It's still not *great* cinema, but that's understandable as it never aspired to be. It wanted to be a fun, popcorn-chomping romp, and at that, it does its job. Or, at least 3-Stars worth of it.Still, I have to wonder a little bit. If you have a wonderful property to work with like Dumas' novel, the budget and the talent to pull it off in reasonable fashion, why would you completely throw out the story (and almost completely throw out the characters) that has made it so famous and so lasting, and replace it with a generic action script? The original is long and complicated, and I understand the difficulties inherent to condensing it to a 90 minute feature. Maybe this film played it safe, in offering up the usual Hollywood-fare. But playing it safe can only ever bring limited success, and whatever its box-office at the time, this film doesn't hold up that well a decade and a half later.For those truly interested: read the book, instead.

Stephen Herek (""Man Of The House"") directs this bold take on the classic adventure novel by the great Alexandre Dumas, who also wrote two sequels to ""The Three Musketeers,"" ""The Count Of Monte Cristo,"" ""Le Reine Margot,"" ""The Black Tulip,"" among others). Taking the basic portions of the novel, screenwriter David Loughery made it more for kids, throwing in just the right amount of humor, suspense and non-graphic action that audiences expected from a film adaptation of the novel, changing Lady De Winter's (played to a perfect S by the sensual Rebecca DeMornay) very complicated first name, making the Cardinal (wonderfully played to a T by screen villain Tim Curry) somewhat of a lecher and a traitor/  making D'Artagnan more of the protagonist than he is in the novel. He also completely leaves out the backstory on how Lady De Winter became evil, Athos' connection with Lord De Winter, Rochefort eluding D'Artagnan until the end of the story, King Louis XIII being a cruel and jealous s.o.b. (an aspect that was corrected very well in the movie; should've been developed more, however, but it probably would've made it PG-13 or R, had he done so), Madame Bonacieux's (here simply called Constance, her first name in the novel) foul murder, the Puritan assassin Felton, the Duke Of Buckingham (only mentioned here) and the servants of the four, just to name several details. If you're a purist, then this movie isn't for you. But if you're open-minded and want a fresh look at the classic novel, combined with Disney fun, then THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU.Everyone in the film did a great job, especially Michael Wincott as the villainous (and one-eyed here) Captain Rochefort (in the novel, he's also a Count). The backstory of how he murdered King Louis XIII's father, as part of an insidious plot by Richelieu, killing D'Artagnan's father in the process, should've been explored further, so that the ""Loose ends"" could be ""Tied up."" Good way to do it, though. The theme song ""All For Love"" (also included on the VHS) was great, performed by Bryan Adams (who sang ""Everything I Do"" at the end of ""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"" [see my review of that film in conjunction with the 1938 classic starring screen legend Errol Flynn]), Rod Stewart and Sting, with music by Michael Kamen (who also scored ""Licence To Kill"" [see my review on that] and ""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"") was very well done. The only other feature on the DVD (a trailer would've also been neat) is a 3-minute production featurette. The 2:35 widescreen aspect ratio is astounding. All in all, great film. The 3 Musketeers movies (and yes, I'm including the abominable ""Return Of The Musketeers"" in this one)starring Michael York are shallow and pathetic, as they're very bawdy and take too many liberties with the novel.

All I know was that I was feeling really bored and apathetic at the time I saw it last week and it brightened me up immediately.It started doing this by making Oliver Platt a musketeer, something I never would have imagined. Then it took a good score (and a song with Sting, Rod Stewart, and that other guy whose name I didn't get) and put them in the movie. Then it added lots of swordfights, which were good enough. The plot may not have been like the original, but it was viable and it flowed well. The actors were good, they came through in their roles. It was an enjoyable film.P.S.

Barton ""Beth Barton""","[4, 6]","As I read the book I realized that the casting on this movie was superb even if the story line leaves that of the book's after the initial duel and the entire plot line would make only one chapter in the original book.  This is still a great movie even if it doesn't follow the book beyond the names.  I have watched this countless times and will watch it many more.  I still laugh at the jokes and get tense with the suspense.D'Artagnan has come to Paris to join the musketeers but when he gets to Paris, he finds that the musketeers have just been disbanded by the Cardinal under approval from the Regent King (although the King disapproves of the timing and manner).  He quickly runs afoul of Athos, Porthos and Aramis and has duels scheduled with each an hour apart at the old convent.  Just as the swords are crossed, the Cardinal's men appear to arrest them and d'Artagnan makes a stand with the three musketeers thereby not only making him an outlaw but making a favorable impression with his new comrades who recognize his father's name as a valiant musketeer that died in service to the king. From there on, the movie bears absolutely no resemblance to the book (and d'Artagnan's father was not dead or a musketeer). When d'Artagnan is arrested and interrogated about the whereabouts of the three musketeers, he overhears plans of the Cardinal's to send a secret treaty to the Duke of Buckingham (""who rules England the way the Cardinal rules France"") in an attempt to overthrow the King's rule and claim the crown for himself.  Rescued from the chopping block by the three musketeers, they immediately give chase to the Cardinal's messenger as his henchmen all over the country pursue them to claim the reward for their capture.  It is a thrilling, action packed chase with a wonderful climax and lots of great zingers from Porthos.  I honestly do not think any other actors alive could have pulled off these characters as well as Keifer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen and Oliver Platt.The spirit of Dumas' musketeers is alive and well with these four.  Charlie Sheen is excellent as the dark eyed and dreamily romantic Aramis with a fervor for religion. Keifer Sutherland's reserved air is perfect for the noble and quiet Athos.  Oliver Platt is exactly what and how I picture Porthos.  Both men and women will love this movie for the perfect mix of adventure and romance.Long live the musketeers!!",5,The SPIRIT of Dumas' musketeers is alive and well,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,2404,"['read', 'book', 'realized', 'casting', 'movie', 'was', 'superb', 'even', 'story', 'line', 'book', 'initial', 'duel', 'entire', 'plot', 'line', 'would', 'make', 'only', 'one', 'chapter', 'original', 'book', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'even', ""n't"", 'follow', 'book', 'names', 'have', 'watched', 'countless', 'times', 'will', 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'still', 'laugh', 'jokes', 'get', 'tense', ""suspense.D'Artagnan"", 'come', 'Paris', 'join', 'musketeers', 'when', 'Paris', 'musketeers', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'disbanded', 'Cardinal', 'approval', 'Regent', 'King', 'King', 'disapproves', 'timing', 'manner', 'quickly', 'afoul', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis', 'duels', 'scheduled', 'hour', 'apart', 'old', 'convent', 'Just', 'swords', 'are', 'crossed', 'Cardinal', 'men', 'appear', 'arrest', ""d'Artagnan"", 'stand', 'three', 'musketeers', 'thereby', 'not', 'only', 'making', 'outlaw', 'making', 'favorable', 'impression', 'new', 'comrades', 'who', 'recognize', 'father', 'name', 'valiant', 'musketeer', 'died', 'service', 'king', 'there', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'resemblance', 'book', ""d'Artagnan"", 'father', 'was', 'not', 'dead', 'musketeer', 'When', ""d'Artagnan"", 'arrested', 'interrogated', 'whereabouts', 'three', 'musketeers', 'plans', 'Cardinal', 'send', 'secret', 'treaty', 'Duke', 'Buckingham', 'who', 'rules', 'England', 'way', 'Cardinal', 'rules', 'France', 'attempt', 'overthrow', 'King', 'rule', 'claim', 'crown', 'Rescued', 'chopping', 'block', 'three', 'musketeers', 'immediately', 'give', 'chase', 'Cardinal', 'messenger', 'henchmen', 'country', 'pursue', 'claim', 'reward', 'capture', 'thrilling', 'action', 'packed', 'chase', 'wonderful', 'climax', 'lots', 'great', 'zingers', 'Porthos', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'other', 'actors', 'alive', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Oliver', 'Platt.The', 'spirit', 'Dumas', 'musketeers', 'alive', 'well', 'four', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'excellent', 'dark', 'eyed', 'dreamily', 'romantic', 'Aramis', 'fervor', 'religion', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'reserved', 'air', 'perfect', 'noble', 'quiet', 'Athos', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'exactly', 'what', 'how', 'picture', 'Porthos', 'men', 'women', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'perfect', 'mix', 'adventure', 'romance.Long', 'live', 'musketeers']",The Three Musketeers Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS

354307,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6303066720,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[9, 11]","Because of the departure of the story from the Alexandre Dumas book, some may not like this movie.  However, if you think of this movie as having been inspired by the book you will enjoy it a lot more.  The action is good, the movie is reasonably family friendly, and the sprinkling of comedy fills in the transitions.  However, people are killed during the fighting and Tim Curry as Cardinal Richelieu is sincerely evil, so those without any taste for violence should avoid this movie.The story is generally familiar.  Aramis (Charlie Sheen), Porthos (Oliver Platt) and Athos (Kiefer Sutherland) meet would be Musketeer D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell).  Initially D'Artagnan is unaware that Athos, Porthos and Aramis are Musketeers, and the three Musketeers are unaware the D'Artagnan is the son of a Musketeer and desires to be a Musketeer himself.  Unfortunately for D'Artagnan the Musketeers had just quit en masse because Cardinal Richelieu had replaced the Musketeers, who guarded King Louis (Hugh O'Conor), with his own guards, led by Rochefort (played by Michael Wincott in a most sinister fashion).From this beginning the movie speeds up.  The story becomes complex as we learn that Lady Sabine de Winter is on a traitorous mission for Cardinal Richelieu.  The Musketeers and D'Artagnan must stop her or France may be doomed.  However, we learn that Lady de Winter knows one of the Musketeers, whom she has not seen for many years.  We also learn that the Cardinal has a nefarious plan that he will execute on the King's birthday.The end of this movie is a lot of fun as, in true swashbuckler style, there is generous swordplay and fantastic escapes.  I believe that the stars of swashbuckling movies of the past would appreciate this movie.I have read reviews that both praise this movie and pan it.  This movie is not true to the original story.  However, it is very entertaining and I have enjoyed this one several times.  I know I will enjoy watching it again.  In recent years Disney has had difficulties in creating movies in the tradition started by Walt Disney.  However, this one is worthy of the Disney name.

The story of the book is also incredibly simplified, and the main  characters have been given typical &quot;hero&quot; makeovers.

It's lots of fun and has plenty of action and adventure. And I think that's it's not only great for kids but for teenagers and adults alike.Here's the summary of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Chris O'Donnel is D'Artagnan, a young, brash, proud, yet courageous 'kid' whose only dream is to become one of the king's musketeers. But when he gets to Paris, he finds that the musketeers have been disbanded by the young King Louis's (Hugh O'Conor) evil Cardinal, Richelieu (Tim Curry). But three musketeers who are the best of friends, Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Aramis (Charlie Sheen), and Porthos (Oliver Platt), are suspicious of Cardinal Richelieu and his henchman Rochefort (Michael Wincott). D'Artagnan is put in jail for fighting the Cardinal's guards with the three musketeers. Though he tries to escape yet fails, he is able to overhear the Cardinal's plan to take over the throne, building an alliance with the Duke of Buckingham by way of a special courier, Lady DeWinter (Rebecca De Mornay). And before D'Artagnan is executed, Athos, Aramis, and Porthos rescue him and together set out to stop Richelieu's spy. They do intercept her, finding out that Lady DeWinter was actually Athos's wife, whom had betrayed him and him sending her away. At the last moment they find out that the Cardinal is planning to have the king assisinated on his birthday. The four men return as swiftly as possible to Paris and with the help of all the musketeers, stop Richelieu.As I said, though this movie has plenty of funny and humorous parts, it still has plenty of action and adventure, with a touch of romance here and there. The fighting is really good, and the acting was terrific, especially all the three musketeers, Tim Curry, and Michael Wincott. I love the endless little 'extras' Porthos always has with him!An enjoyable film which is very entertaining! I also recommend for you to watch &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; which was made in the early 1970's.",5,"Not the book, yet still a great movie!!",1000857600,"09 19, 2001",2001,2128,"['must', 'agree', 'everyone', 'who', 'wrote', 'reviews', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'Dumas', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'reason', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'lots', 'fun', 'plenty', 'action', 'adventure', 'think', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'kids', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'summary', 'quot', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'quot', 'Chris', ""O'Donnel"", ""D'Artagnan"", 'young', 'brash', 'proud', 'yet', 'courageous', ""'kid"", 'only', 'dream', 'become', 'one', 'king', 'musketeers', 'when', 'Paris', 'musketeers', 'have', 'been', 'disbanded', 'young', 'King', 'Louis', 'Hugh', ""O'Conor"", 'evil', 'Cardinal', 'Richelieu', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'three', 'musketeers', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'Athos', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Aramis', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Porthos', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'are', 'suspicious', 'Cardinal', 'Richelieu', 'henchman', 'Rochefort', 'Michael', 'Wincott', ""D'Artagnan"", 'put', 'jail', 'fighting', 'Cardinal', 'guards', 'three', 'musketeers', 'escape', 'yet', 'fails', 'able', 'overhear', 'Cardinal', 'plan', 'take', 'over', 'throne', 'building', 'alliance', 'Duke', 'Buckingham', 'way', 'special', 'courier', 'Lady', 'DeWinter', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', ""D'Artagnan"", 'executed', 'Athos', 'Aramis', 'Porthos', 'rescue', 'together', 'set', 'out', 'stop', 'Richelieu', 'spy', 'do', 'intercept', 'finding', 'out', 'Lady', 'DeWinter', 'was', 'actually', 'Athos', 'wife', 'whom', 'had', 'betrayed', 'sending', 'away', 'last', 'moment', 'find', 'out', 'Cardinal', 'planning', 'have', 'king', 'assisinated', 'birthday', 'four', 'men', 'return', 'as', 'swiftly', 'possible', 'Paris', 'help', 'musketeers', 'stop', 'Richelieu.As', 'said', 'movie', 'plenty', 'funny', 'humorous', 'parts', 'still', 'plenty', 'action', 'adventure', 'touch', 'romance', 'here', 'there', 'fighting', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'terrific', 'especially', 'three', 'musketeers', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'love', 'endless', 'little', 'Porthos', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'also', 'recommend', 'watch', 'quot', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'early', '1970']",The Three Musketeers Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS

Ever read the original versions of Cinderella? It's most certainly NOT for children. The movie and printed Disney versions are far from true to the original tale. Fact is, Cinderella and The Three Musketeers aren't the only ones Disney drastically toned down.Perhaps those who don't like this one's accuracy would wish to have their children watch the stepsisters' self mutilations in attempting to make their feet fit the slipper and pigeons pecking out their eyes in Cinderella, and maybe heads rolling in The Three Musketeers, etc. But I doubt many will want their children watching such things.Disney produces for family entertainment in films such as these. They don't get concerned over accuracy because it's not a film to stimulate prolonged historical discussion and debate between parents and ten year olds, but merely to entertain.I love a good historically accurate movie, but I know when to drop that concern and just enjoy a good bit of fiction.

The costumes look like they just came from the costume department, the hair styles look like they just came from hair-and-makeup, the accents and dialogue are right off the streets of LA, the story has been butchered from the original by Alexandre Dumas, the scenes are full of idiotic business (as opposed to the clever action of the 1974 version), the acting is mediocre (none of these actors hold a candle to the '74 cast), etc. The worst insult of all is that Dumas' novel is an historical novel, based on actual people and events; but NOTHING in this film has ANYTHING to do with history. The thing is, no one cares anymore. No one cares if a great novel is butchered, or if a great film is forgotten in order to make room for a truly mediocre one. No one cares about details, facts or nuance. The anachronisms in this film would fill a book. I don't know, I just believe that if you're going to do something, you ought to do it well; not force a great narrative into a Hollywood story formula, and expect the actors to act like their doing great work. It breaks my heart that movie-making has gotten to this, and that American audiences don't care. There was a time when they did, but no more. So if all you want is something to watch while you munch your popcorn, then go ahead and enjoy this. But if you want to see Alexandre Dumas' novel come to life, watch the 1974 version, plus the 1975 followup, The Four Musketeers, which was filmed at the same time.By the way: people always criticized the 1948 Gene Kelly version for its slick Hollywood handling of the story. Well, this 1993 version is just as slick and just as bad for the same reasons. After you watch the 1974 version, watch the 1948 version and see if you can tell why these two films are both inferior to the 1974 version. Compare Richard Chamberlain's elegant Aramis, Oliver Reed's Athos, Charlton Heston's Richelieu, Faye Dunaway's Milady de Winter, Jean-Pierre Cassel's Louis XIII, Michael York's D'Artagnan, Christopher Lee's Rochefort, Simon Ward's Duke of Buckingham (who didn't even appear in the 1993 version) - even Raquel Welch's Constance. Compare the costumes and sets, which were really authentic and made you feel like you were actually in that period. Compare the action and the business, which were really very clever. Compare the humor, which the 1993 version copied from the 1974 one. Compare everything. There's just no comparison.Waitsel Smith",3,LACKS THE GRIT AND INTELLIGENCE OF 1974 VERSION,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,2580,"['know', ""'ll"", 'get', 'panned', 'going', 'pack', 'are', 'fan', '1974', 'version', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'one', 'costumes', 'look', 'just', 'came', 'costume', 'department', 'hair', 'look', 'just', 'came', 'hair-and-makeup', 'accents', 'dialogue', 'are', 'right', 'streets', 'LA', 'story', 'been', 'butchered', 'original', 'Alexandre', 'Dumas', 'scenes', 'are', 'full', 'idiotic', 'business', 'opposed', 'clever', 'action', '1974', 'version', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'none', 'actors', 'hold', 'candle', ""'74"", 'cast', 'etc', 'worst', 'insult', 'Dumas', 'novel', 'historical', 'novel', 'based', 'actual', 'people', 'events', 'NOTHING', 'film', 'ANYTHING', 'do', 'history', 'thing', 'one', 'anymore', 'one', 'great', 'novel', 'butchered', 'great', 'film', 'forgotten', 'order', 'make', 'room', 'truly', 'mediocre', 'one', 'one', 'details', 'facts', 'nuance', 'anachronisms', 'film', 'would', 'fill', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'believe', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'something', 'ought', 'do', 'well', 'not', 'force', 'great', 'narrative', 'Hollywood', 'story', 'formula', 'expect', 'actors', 'act', 'doing', 'great', 'work', 'heart', 'movie-making', 'gotten', 'American', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'did', 'more', 'So', 'want', 'something', 'watch', 'munch', 'popcorn', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'enjoy', 'want', 'see', 'Alexandre', 'Dumas', 'novel', 'come', 'life', 'watch', '1974', 'version', '1975', 'followup', 'Four', 'Musketeers', 'was', 'filmed', 'same', 'way', 'people', 'always', 'criticized', '1948', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'version', 'slick', 'Hollywood', 'handling', 'story', 'Well', '1993', 'version', 'just', 'slick', 'just', 'bad', 'same', 'reasons', 'watch', '1974', 'version', 'watch', '1948', 'version', 'see', 'can', 'tell', 'why', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'inferior', '1974', 'version', 'Compare', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'elegant', 'Aramis', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'Athos', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Richelieu', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Milady', 'de', 'Winter', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Cassel', 'Louis', 'XIII', 'Michael', 'York', ""D'Artagnan"", 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Rochefort', 'Simon', 'Ward', 'Duke', 'Buckingham', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', '1993', 'version', 'even', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'Constance', 'Compare', 'costumes', 'sets', 'were', 'really', 'authentic', 'made', 'feel', 'were', 'actually', 'period', 'Compare', 'action', 'business', 'were', 'really', 'very', 'clever', 'Compare', 'humor', '1993', 'version', 'copied', '1974', 'one', 'Compare', 'everything', 'just', 'comparison.Waitsel', 'Smith']",The Three Musketeers Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS
