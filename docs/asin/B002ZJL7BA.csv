1314342,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B002ZJL7BA,Eric Sanberg,"[7, 8]","This is a quirky, left of center indy comedy. It centers on Anora, an Oklahoma housewife who lives in a dream world fantasizing over a perfect husband, perfect marriage and perfect family that is at odds with her reality. Her husband's a jerk, her marriage is a mockery and her kids are screwed up beyond all possible belief.She gets a new neighbor, Imogene,  who sells a Mary Kay type line of cosmetics. Imogene is upbeat, friendly and black which doesn't bode well with Anora's husband or kids. But she's the only person in Anora's life that pays her any attention and shows her any kindness. The two end up falling for each other and during a sexual interlude Anora's husband (drunk) comes in and goes bananas. He pulls a gun but things go wrong and he's the the one who ends up getting shot by Anora. The two women dump his body in the trunk of Imogene's car. Anora grabs her two kids and they all head to Savannah, where Imogene's boss lives, to dispose of the body. It's a shortish road trip but all come to new understandings in their lives.This is pretty light stuff. It's shot on the cheap but looks good to the point of not being detrimental to the viewing experience. The only actors recognizable to me were Anora, played by Laura Harring and her husband played by Oded Fehr. The production, overall, is even handed. Most of the performances are pretty good and it's dotted with some quirky animation sprung from the doodlings of Anora's daughter.The writing is really what makes this worthwhile. It IS quirky. A lot of unexpected things happen and everything moves a brisk pace. It clocks in at an hour twenty five so you won't sit there looking at your watch. The performances match the quirkiness of the script. Harring particularly seemed to understand her part and the tone of the movie. For my money she hits it dead on. It's a shame she doesn't get more work.These kinds of movies are not for everyone, but those who really enjoy film in all its varied forms, should have a good time with this. It won't change your life but it's a nice vacation to an unexpected destination.",4,Nice Travel Down a Side Road,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2093,"['quirky', 'left', 'center', 'indy', 'comedy', 'Anora', 'Oklahoma', 'housewife', 'who', 'dream', 'world', 'fantasizing', 'perfect', 'husband', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'perfect', 'family', 'odds', 'reality', 'husband', 'jerk', 'marriage', 'mockery', 'kids', 'are', 'screwed', 'up', 'possible', 'belief.She', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Imogene', 'who', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'type', 'line', 'cosmetics', 'Imogene', 'upbeat', 'friendly', 'black', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'Anora', 'husband', 'kids', 'only', 'person', 'Anora', 'life', 'attention', 'kindness', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'other', 'sexual', 'interlude', 'Anora', 'husband', 'drunk', 'bananas', 'gun', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'getting', 'shot', 'Anora', 'two', 'women', 'dump', 'body', 'trunk', 'Imogene', 'car', 'Anora', 'grabs', 'two', 'kids', 'head', 'Savannah', 'where', 'Imogene', 'boss', 'dispose', 'body', 'shortish', 'road', 'trip', 'come', 'new', 'understandings', 'lives.This', 'pretty', 'light', 'stuff', 'shot', 'cheap', 'good', 'point', 'not', 'being', 'detrimental', 'viewing', 'experience', 'only', 'actors', 'recognizable', 'were', 'Anora', 'played', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'husband', 'played', 'Oded', 'Fehr', 'production', 'overall', 'even', 'handed', 'Most', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'dotted', 'quirky', 'animation', 'sprung', 'doodlings', 'Anora', 'daughter.The', 'writing', 'really', 'what', 'worthwhile', 'quirky', 'lot', 'unexpected', 'things', 'happen', 'everything', 'moves', 'brisk', 'pace', 'hour', 'twenty', 'five', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sit', 'there', 'looking', 'watch', 'performances', 'match', 'quirkiness', 'script', 'Harring', 'particularly', 'seemed', 'understand', 'part', 'tone', 'movie', 'money', 'dead', 'shame', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'work.These', 'kinds', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'everyone', 'who', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'varied', 'forms', 'should', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'life', 'nice', 'vacation', 'unexpected', 'destination']",N/A

1314344,A2AKFRACK8O3H6,B002ZJL7BA,"Lesbian Film Guide ""Chris""","[0, 0]","Abused housewife Anora Fleece (Laura Harring) is bewildered by the state of her own life. She lives in a fantasyland most days, mainly because her real life is too horrible to accept. Her husband Cheb (Oded Fehr) is verbally and physically abusive to her and their two teenaged kids.When beautiful and vivacious Imogene (Jill Marie Jones) moves in next door, they become friends despite her husband's bigoted attitude. Anora and Imogene's relationship becomes closer over coffee and long conversations about life and the Kathy K cosmetics that Imogene sells. When Anora's husband Cheb catches the women kissing on their bed, he freaks out and tries to kill them. Wrestling the gun out of his grasp, Anora accidentally shoots him.Imogene brilliantly takes control of the situation and leads Anora and her two teen-aged kids on an adventure in her huge bright purple Kathy K Cosmetics car (with Cheb in the trunk). Imogene takes them to Savannah to visit the one and only Kathy K (Ruthie Austin). Once there, Kathy K relocates Cheb to her bathtub for safekeeping, but how long can a dead body stay there before it is discovered?Director Nancy Kissam creates a darkly funny romp, which at the heart of it all, is about an abused woman who regains her life, self-worth and finds love. Scene stealing Jill Marie Jones is hilarious as the wisecracking Imogene. Laura Harring is fantastic as the sad and pathetic Anora who blossoms at the hands of Imogene.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide",3,Light-hearted fun...,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1500,"['Abused', 'housewife', 'Anora', 'Fleece', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'bewildered', 'state', 'own', 'life', 'fantasyland', 'most', 'days', 'mainly', 'real', 'life', 'too', 'horrible', 'accept', 'husband', 'Cheb', 'Oded', 'Fehr', 'verbally', 'physically', 'abusive', 'two', 'teenaged', 'kids.When', 'beautiful', 'vivacious', 'Imogene', 'Jill', 'Marie', 'Jones', 'next', 'door', 'become', 'friends', 'husband', 'bigoted', 'attitude', 'Anora', 'Imogene', 'relationship', 'closer', 'coffee', 'long', 'conversations', 'life', 'Kathy', 'K', 'cosmetics', 'Imogene', 'When', 'Anora', 'husband', 'Cheb', 'women', 'kissing', 'bed', 'out', 'tries', 'kill', 'Wrestling', 'gun', 'grasp', 'Anora', 'accidentally', 'him.Imogene', 'brilliantly', 'control', 'situation', 'Anora', 'two', 'teen-aged', 'kids', 'adventure', 'huge', 'bright', 'purple', 'Kathy', 'K', 'Cosmetics', 'car', 'Cheb', 'trunk', 'Imogene', 'Savannah', 'visit', 'one', 'only', 'Kathy', 'K', 'Ruthie', 'Austin', 'Once', 'there', 'Kathy', 'K', 'Cheb', 'bathtub', 'safekeeping', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'dead', 'body', 'stay', 'there', 'discovered', 'Director', 'Nancy', 'Kissam', 'darkly', 'funny', 'romp', 'heart', 'abused', 'woman', 'who', 'life', 'self-worth', 'love', 'Scene', 'stealing', 'Jill', 'Marie', 'Jones', 'hilarious', 'wisecracking', 'Imogene', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'fantastic', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'Anora', 'who', 'blossoms', 'hands', 'Imogene.Chris', 'AldersonAuthor', '2013', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Guide']",N/A
