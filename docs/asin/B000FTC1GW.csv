It has been one of my favorites for years, and when I first started collecting TV on DVD, I was especially excited at the prospect of being able to get this one. I had hoped to buy the entire series at once, silly, naive person that I am, I thought they would want to make as much money as they could off such a BELOVED show by getting it out there so people can BUY IT!But while I now own hundreds of seasons of TV on DVD, thanks to Warners, my grandchildren will one day be saying, ""oh look, there's the last season of that show Gram liked so much, FINALLY. Too bad she never got to see it. "" Of course they won't buy it, because they're too young to CARE. WAKE UP! It's time to get these classic series out IN THEIR ENTIRETY so those of us who love them can still buy them.UPDATE* Well, they finally came out with all the seasons of Night Court, but I would have to mortgage my house to buy them! These TV people live in some other world, not the one I live in. They seem to think we all have money to burn, when the truth is that the American public's pockets were picked clean YEARS ago.

And the Court room has never been the same!Night Court was a poke in the eye of the legal system and the people who do crazy things in a sane world. What ""Welcome Back Kotter"" did for education and ""Barney Miller"" did for Law Enforcement, this show does for the legal system.for those who dont know the show (AND you should!), Harry Anderson (Dave's World)  plays Judge Harry Stone..a Judge, a Joker and glue that holds this show together. John Larroquette (long befor Boston Legal) plays Dan Fielding..Part DA, all slimy and overly sexual heel with a heart (Just dont tell anyone). Richard Moll (The voice of Two Face on Batman the Animated Series) is Bull the Batiff... a tower of strength with a child-like innocent. Selma Diamond (in her last TV role) is Selma the head Batiff who has been around and seen it all forever. Charles Robinson is Mac, Court Clerk who tries to keep the order of the docts, but never does. Ellen Foley plays defense attorney Billie...in many ways, she does not fit with the rest of the assembled cast.Put these actors together and watch the fun mesh. I loved this show when I was younger and I still do. It is not a timeless classic of Television nor it is tasteful morsel that you will remember for decades, but it is a good sitcom. This show  is like a bawdy revue. What I mean is some jokes will make you laugh, other flop badly...but still you chuckle the way this cast makes this work. This show is situation and plot  driven, not a one yuck showI make a comparison  with Boston Legal. However Legal is a comedy drama, but this show is a straight forward comedy with comics knowing their craft milking and mining the script for their moments to shine.

PLEASE click on the button above to be e-mailed by Amazon when this product is finally available, so Warner Brothers will realize how wrong it's been to deprive us of the second season for soooooooo long!  Seeing this here just made my night!  Yes yes YES!UPDATE:  May 27, 2007Well, an entire year has now passed since I wrote my comments above.  The joy I expressed that night has since turned into frustration.  I just don't understand this!  WHY won't Warner Bros. release the second season?  The 6-episode ""Television Favorites"" compilation disc has not seemed to get them moving at all, unlike some of the other shows they tried that tactic with.  ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and ""The Drew Carey Show"" were both given season sets following those releases, but ""Night Court"" still seems to be dead in the water.  The thought of being stuck with the butchered syndication versions of the final eight seasons (and even then, shown only rarely) is NOT appealing.The length of time between first and second seasons is approaching ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" proportions!  I can only hope that the end result will be the same...better late than never!Well Warner, the ball's in your ""court""!  (pun intended)UPDATE:  October 10, 2008Hooray!!!!!

Night Court really struggled to find itself for the first two seasons. Once they got the final ensemble cast in place though, it clicked so well that the best way I can describe it to modern audiences is ""Scrubs"" in a 1980's courtroom instead of a hospital. There were always a couple of central themes at work in each episode between the main characters, while the interesting parade of Night Court defendants and plaintiffs made for great sight gags and one-shot humor that kept the show fast-paced and fresh.Season two changes that are for the better include the additions of Charles Robinson as court clerk ""Mac"" and Ellen Foley as Billie, the public defender. In turn, Karen Austin as Lana Wagner and Paula Kelly as Liz Williams were deleted from the cast. With a better supporting cast, season two was more about ensemble acting and less about Harry Anderson doing his stand-up routine in a judge's robe. Once Markie Post was added to the cast in season 3, the show was pretty close to perfect for about the next four years. Thus the show had to ""jump the shark in reverse"" for the first two seasons before things were just right. Only when creator Reinhold Weege left the show at the end of season six did I notice any downturn in quality, starting with the ""softening"" of Dan Fielding.Probably one of the best episodes of the second season was ""The Blizzard"" in which Dan (John Larroquette) is trapped in an elevator with a man who is attracted to him, while the rest of the staff is trapped inside the courthouse itself. Another good one was ""Married Alive"" when Dan starts dating a socially backwards woman who just happens to be heiress to forty million dollars. Dan's libido and money problems were a great source of comedy throughout the series.Here's to hoping we have all nine seasons of this great show on DVD before too long.",5,A somewhat forgotten comedy gem of the 1980's,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,1980,"['hope', 'less', 'stellar', 'sales', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'Night', 'Court', 'are', 'not', 'preventing', 'latter', 'seasons', 'being', 'released', 'Night', 'Court', 'really', 'struggled', 'find', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'got', 'final', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'place', 'clicked', 'so', 'well', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'modern', 'audiences', 'Scrubs', '1980', 'courtroom', 'instead', 'hospital', 'were', 'always', 'couple', 'central', 'themes', 'work', 'episode', 'main', 'characters', 'interesting', 'parade', 'Night', 'Court', 'defendants', 'plaintiffs', 'made', 'great', 'sight', 'gags', 'one-shot', 'humor', 'kept', 'show', 'fast-paced', 'fresh.Season', 'two', 'changes', 'are', 'better', 'include', 'additions', 'Charles', 'Robinson', 'court', 'clerk', 'Mac', 'Ellen', 'Foley', 'Billie', 'public', 'defender', 'turn', 'Karen', 'Austin', 'Lana', 'Wagner', 'Paula', 'Kelly', 'Liz', 'Williams', 'were', 'deleted', 'cast', 'better', 'supporting', 'cast', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'more', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'less', 'Harry', 'Anderson', 'doing', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'judge', 'robe', 'Once', 'Markie', 'Post', 'was', 'added', 'cast', 'season', '3', 'show', 'was', 'pretty', 'close', 'perfect', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'Thus', 'show', 'had', 'jump', 'shark', 'reverse', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'things', 'were', 'just', 'right', 'Only', 'when', 'creator', 'Reinhold', 'Weege', 'left', 'show', 'end', 'season', 'six', 'did', 'notice', 'downturn', 'quality', 'starting', 'softening', 'Dan', 'Fielding.Probably', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'Blizzard', 'Dan', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'trapped', 'elevator', 'man', 'who', 'attracted', 'rest', 'staff', 'trapped', 'courthouse', 'good', 'one', 'was', 'Married', 'Alive', 'when', 'Dan', 'dating', 'socially', 'backwards', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'heiress', 'forty', 'million', 'dollars', 'Dan', 'libido', 'money', 'problems', 'were', 'great', 'source', 'comedy', 'series.Here', 'hoping', 'have', 'nine', 'seasons', 'great', 'show', 'DVD', 'too', 'long']",Night Court: Season 2

This season seems to be made a bit differently and the tracking issues are gone. (by tracking I mean going from say the theme to the start of the show after the theme). I think these are made by a different company than the first season, which is great. It looks great and still has the charm and insanity that I recall. One of my favorite shows. Cheers and Night Court was my favorite hour of tv back in the day. It's great how Mac is there from the beginning. He wasn't so much introduced as he was just shown. Which works. There is no sense that they changed from season one (even though they did with character change ups) it's almost like while we were waiting for the second season life at the municipal court building kept going on, and we just caught up with them in the fall. A great show. a bit underappreciated, but overall well loved. Glad to see the whole series coming out (there was a huge delay between season 1 & 2 ) now it's going great, they have but one more season to release. It is definitely worth checking out. While this show seems a bit insane and holds very little similarities to real life, the actors pull off the absurdity with such skill that you simply do not care. A bit over the top at times but in a fun way, not in a stupid way. Though where I grew up I've seen many strange and crazy things just not all in one room. But that's what makes this show great, you get great scripted jokes, tons of great slapstick/physical comedey as well as good character development and always always a smile.

995613,A20U54S8PC1291,B000FTC1GW,J. McDonald,"[114, 119]","My original ""review"" was written in 2006, with a main focus on how PATHETIC it was that Warner Brothers had not yet released season two. After four years, and many excellent reviews by other fans, it looks like we will FINALLY get our wish! I have decided to change the tone of my review from ""negative"" to ""positive"", and enhance it with episode information. My original review is still attached at the bottom, perhaps as a reminder to Warner of how unhappy we all were (and that they had better not wait another FOUR years before releasing season THREE).Brief episode list:1. ""The Nun"" - 9/27/1984Dinah Manoff as a NUN! Woohoo!2. Christine and Mac (a.k.a. Daddy for the Defense) - 10/4/1984Markie Post arrives (for one episode)!!!3.  Billie and the Cat - 10/18/1984It's a ""catnapping"" and Harry sends public defender Billie Young to jail.4. Pick a Number - 10/25/1984A winning lottery ticket sends the courtroom into a frenzy!5. The Computer Kid - 11/1/1984A computer whiz takes over Harry's office!6. Bull Gets a Kid - 11/8/1984Yep. Bull becomes a foster parent!7. Harry on Trial - 11/15/1984Harry isn't your average judge, and he could be in trouble for it!8. Harry and the Madam - 11/22/1984Stella Stevens guest stars!9. Inside Harry Stone - 11/29/1984John Astin guest stars! Harry and his darn ulcer!10. The Blizzard - 12/6/1984Trapped in the courtroom! Dan is stuck in an elevator, and he's NOT alone.11. Take My Wife, Please - 12/13/1984Michael Richards guest stars!!12. The Birthday Visitor - 1/3/1985It's Billie's Birthday... but it doesn't go smoothly!13. Dan's Parents - 1/10/1985Dan's past AND parents come to haunt him!14. Nuts About Harry - 1/17/1985Nuts are on the loose! Mental patients go on strike!15. An Old Flame - 1/24/1985Selma's old boyfriend shows up.16. The Gypsy - 1/31/1985Bull is cursed! Or is he?17. Battling Bailiff - 2/7/1985Bull quits to become a pro wrestler!18. Billie's Valentine - 2/14/1985Billie's boyfriend causes a lot of trouble! Guest: Lou Ferrigno!!!19. Married Alive - 2/21/1985Dan the gold-digger?20. Mac and Quon Le: Together Again - 2/28/1985Billie or Dan for a comission?21. World War III - 5/2/1985Yakov Smirnoff and Gordon Jump!22. Walk, Don't Wheel - 5/9/1985Harry refuses to go to the prom with a disabled girl.Twenty Two great episodes of classic comedy! Markie Post doesn't yet become a regular cast member (you'll have to wait 'til season three). Speaking of Markie Post; fans sure would like to have the second season of ""the Fall Guy"" released (where she appeared from 1982-1985).It's been a LONG wait, but it will certainly be worth it! There are still OTHER great series out there that have been treated unfairly by the studios, so this release can be seen as a bit of hope for all of us!Three cheers for the arrival of season two!JM------ > My original review:It boggles my mind that a tv series like DOOGIE HOWSER has FOUR seasons out on DVD while a program like Night Court that ran for NINE years has only ONE!I would never describe the folks at Warner Bros. as being ""bright"", after all they had an entire TV network ""close shop"" and merge with another failed network (UPN). I'm sure it's all a reflection of ""great decision making"" :)At any rate, maybe they'll do something RIGHT for a change and release the second season of Night Court... FINALLY.Two thumbs up for Amazon and I hope they know something that we don't know about the potential of this release.P.S.Just because a DVD box set of a ""season one"" doesn't sell as well as a production company would like doesn't mean that future releases of later seasons will not sell better or even HELP to increase sales of the first season. Also, when several seasons have been released buyers tend to be more willing to make an investment into the series as a whole. I know lots of people who wait until several seasons are out (or even an entire series) before they start buying.If you're going to release a ""season one"" of a TV series on DVD you're making a promise to fans of that series. I think production companies need to wise up and realize that they will certainly make all the money they wanted if they simply make a commitment and release everything. They may not see huge numbers at the beginning... but it will all sell eventually. Also, having the product ""out there"" is valuable in terms of NAME RECOGNITION for the production company. It will help the Warner Bros. NAME to have high quality and COMPLETE series in the DVD marketplace. Night Court is one of those series.JM",5,After FOUR years of waiting..... season two FINALLY arrives!,1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,4502,"['original', 'review', 'was', 'written', '2006', 'main', 'focus', 'how', 'PATHETIC', 'was', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'released', 'season', 'two', 'four', 'years', 'many', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'other', 'fans', 'will', 'FINALLY', 'get', 'wish', 'have', 'decided', 'change', 'tone', 'review', 'negative', 'positive', 'enhance', 'episode', 'information', 'My', 'original', 'review', 'still', 'attached', 'bottom', 'perhaps', 'reminder', 'Warner', 'how', 'unhappy', 'were', 'had', 'better', 'not', 'wait', 'FOUR', 'years', 'releasing', 'season', 'THREE', '.Brief', 'episode', 'list:1', 'Nun', '9/27/1984Dinah', 'Manoff', 'NUN', 'Woohoo', '2', 'Christine', 'Mac', 'a.k.a', 'Daddy', 'Defense', '10/4/1984Markie', 'Post', 'arrives', 'one', 'episode', '3', 'Billie', 'Cat', '10/18/1984It', 'catnapping', 'Harry', 'public', 'defender', 'Billie', 'Young', 'jail.4', 'Pick', 'Number', '10/25/1984A', 'winning', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'courtroom', 'frenzy', '5', 'Computer', 'Kid', '11/1/1984A', 'computer', 'whiz', 'Harry', 'office', '6', 'Bull', 'Kid', '11/8/1984Yep', 'Bull', 'foster', 'parent', '7', 'Harry', 'Trial', '11/15/1984Harry', ""n't"", 'average', 'judge', 'could', 'be', 'trouble', '8', 'Harry', 'Madam', '11/22/1984Stella', 'Stevens', 'guest', 'stars', '9', 'Inside', 'Harry', 'Stone', '11/29/1984John', 'Astin', 'guest', 'stars', 'Harry', 'darn', 'ulcer', '10', 'Blizzard', '12/6/1984Trapped', 'courtroom', 'Dan', 'stuck', 'elevator', 'NOT', 'alone.11', 'Take', 'My', 'Wife', 'Please', '12/13/1984Michael', 'Richards', 'guest', 'stars', '12', 'Birthday', 'Visitor', '1/3/1985It', 'Billie', 'Birthday', ""n't"", 'go', 'smoothly', '13', 'Dan', 'Parents', '1/10/1985Dan', 'past', 'parents', 'come', 'haunt', '14', 'Nuts', 'Harry', '1/17/1985Nuts', 'are', 'loose', 'Mental', 'patients', 'go', 'strike', '15', 'Old', 'Flame', '1/24/1985Selma', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'up.16', 'Gypsy', '1/31/1985Bull', 'cursed', '17', 'Battling', 'Bailiff', '2/7/1985Bull', 'quits', 'become', 'pro', 'wrestler', '18', 'Billie', 'Valentine', '2/14/1985Billie', 'boyfriend', 'lot', 'trouble', 'Guest', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', '19', 'Married', 'Alive', '2/21/1985Dan', 'gold-digger', '20', 'Mac', 'Quon', 'Le', 'Together', 'Again', '2/28/1985Billie', 'Dan', 'comission', '21', 'World', 'War', 'III', '5/2/1985Yakov', 'Smirnoff', 'Gordon', 'Jump', '22', 'Walk', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Wheel', '5/9/1985Harry', 'refuses', 'go', 'prom', 'disabled', 'girl.Twenty', 'Two', 'great', 'episodes', 'classic', 'comedy', 'Markie', 'Post', ""n't"", 'yet', 'become', 'regular', 'cast', 'member', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', ""'til"", 'season', 'three', 'Speaking', 'Markie', 'Post', 'fans', 'sure', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'second', 'season', 'Fall', 'Guy', 'released', 'where', 'appeared', '1982-1985', '.It', 'been', 'LONG', 'wait', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'are', 'still', 'OTHER', 'great', 'series', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'unfairly', 'studios', 'release', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'bit', 'hope', 'Three', 'cheers', 'arrival', 'season', 'two', 'JM', '>', 'My', 'original', 'review', 'mind', 'tv', 'series', 'DOOGIE', 'HOWSER', 'FOUR', 'seasons', 'out', 'DVD', 'program', 'Night', 'Court', 'ran', 'NINE', 'years', 'only', 'ONE', 'would', 'never', 'describe', 'folks', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'being', 'bright', 'had', 'entire', 'TV', 'network', 'close', 'shop', 'merge', 'failed', 'network', 'UPN', ""'m"", 'sure', 'reflection', 'great', 'decision', 'making', 'rate', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'do', 'something', 'RIGHT', 'change', 'release', 'second', 'season', 'Night', 'Court', 'FINALLY.Two', 'up', 'Amazon', 'hope', 'know', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'potential', 'release.P.S.Just', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'season', 'one', ""n't"", 'sell', 'as', 'well', 'production', 'company', 'would', 'like', ""n't"", 'mean', 'future', 'releases', 'later', 'seasons', 'will', 'not', 'sell', 'better', 'even', 'HELP', 'increase', 'sales', 'first', 'season', 'Also', 'when', 'several', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'buyers', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'willing', 'make', 'investment', 'series', 'whole', 'know', 'lots', 'people', 'who', 'wait', 'several', 'seasons', 'are', 'out', 'even', 'entire', 'series', 'start', ""'re"", 'going', 'release', 'season', 'one', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'making', 'promise', 'fans', 'series', 'think', 'production', 'companies', 'need', 'wise', 'up', 'realize', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'money', 'wanted', 'simply', 'make', 'commitment', 'release', 'everything', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'huge', 'numbers', 'beginning', 'will', 'sell', 'eventually', 'Also', 'having', 'product', 'there', 'valuable', 'terms', 'NAME', 'RECOGNITION', 'production', 'company', 'will', 'help', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'NAME', 'have', 'high', 'quality', 'COMPLETE', 'series', 'DVD', 'marketplace', 'Night', 'Court', 'one', 'series.JM']",Night Court: Season 2

It was the last season that Selma (played by Selma Diamond) would be seen on the show. She passed away after this season (1985). Selma was one of the funniest members of the early years. Dont get me wrong the firsr 2 seasons were funny but the show really took off on season 3 when Markie Post and new baliff Florence (Florence Halop) joined the cast. From there on the show was golden. The only other change made was when Florence passed away after season 3 Which was written into season 4 as Bull having trouble copping with the loss of two friends ""First Selma now Roz"".So they brought in Marsha Warfield to play Roz. That cast lasted until the show ended. Oh i guess you can also add Macs wife Quon Lee. The show was so hot then everone wanted to make a  guest apperance. The shows with Mel Torme and John Astin were especially funny.BTW, its amazing that with all the reviews that are here about the show there are not very many mentions about Selma & Florence.

This second season entry doesn't disappoint. Picture and audio quality is quite good, and the 3 disc package is well conceived. The disc menu navigates seamlessly. My only regret is the lack of any additions, like interviews, bloopers, promos, etc. DVD sets should provide some historical context for those who remember these TV series fondly. Yet, the price for Season 2 is extremely economical and worth the effort. You won't go wrong buying ""Night Court"" for the many hours of enjoyment. Go for it, and hopefully WB will release subsequent seasons (Seasons 3-5 were probably the best!!)UPDATE:  Night Court Season 2 WILL be available Feb. 3!!  Make plans to pre-order on Amazon.OK .. it's time for the 40+ disgruntled Night Court posters on Amazon to rejoice!  Apparently, Warner Bros acknowledged Night Court, Season 2 will be available in 2009.  Please refer to the following for confirmation[...]Caveat:  There is NO official announcement from WB, thus the deal is not sealed; caution is advised.  However, I've found ""tvshowsondvd"" to be a very reliable source, and feel optimistic you'll be able to pre-order Season 2 on Amazon within a few months.  Hang in there gang ...
