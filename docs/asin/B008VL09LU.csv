My daughter has been especially touched in her heart by this video.  For her, this is Christmas.  She's now 27 and wants her daughter to fall I love with this story as she did.  It is well done, narrated by Christian singer Amy Grant and the late actor Christopher Reeve.  It is well beyond the stereotypical Christmas animated films with Santa.  No dancing or singing.
