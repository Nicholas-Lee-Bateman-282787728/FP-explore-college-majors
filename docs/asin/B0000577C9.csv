Not so, and here's why!1) Everyone blames Ritchie for coming out 1 min and 50 secs. after Gillan, but no one mentions Ian Gillan himself came out 1 minute and 15 secs. after the song started.2) When Ritchie tries to make an entrance like Ian Gillan, he's stopped dead in his tracks by Ian's attempt to humiliate Ritchie with his 'Welcome Your Highness' gesture towards Ritchie? Do you really blame him for being upset at such a obnoxious and juvenile stunt by Gillan?3) Ritchie is visibly upset at Gillan and tries to convey this but Gillan turns his back on him and walks away. All Ritchie does is throw water. Big Deal. He would have been justified if he would have slugged him.4) Gillan's was trying to build momentum with his entrance AND SO WAS RITCHIE BUT Gillan ruined it!!!5)Ritchie IS Deep Purple and still fantastic. Ian is a shadow of his old self and after all the fantastic performances of Deep Purple why blame Ritchie for wanting to quit a band whose lead singer's vocals have deteriorated so much that the band's legacy would certainly begin to suffer. Its not Ian's fault that a singer loses range as they get older but can't Ritchie make a professional decision without everyone attacking him?6) When I saw Deep Purple in the early 70's at the Long Beach Arena in California the crowd of photographers were swarming below the stage directly below Ritchie while he mesmorized them with his lightning leads while every once in awhile throwing his guitar up in the air and catching it without missing a note. A guitar playing legend like Ritchie has earned respect, and if 'Hell and High Water' was ruined it was by Gillan's ego.",4,Don't Blame Ritchie,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,1773,"['Haven', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'getting', 'DVD', 'expected', 'Ritchie', 'be', 'total', 'villian', 'who', 'ruined', 'whole', 'concert', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'why', '1', 'Everyone', 'Ritchie', 'coming', 'out', '1', 'min', '50', 'secs', 'Gillan', 'one', 'mentions', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'came', 'out', '1', 'minute', '15', 'secs', 'song', 'started.2', 'When', 'Ritchie', 'make', 'entrance', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'stopped', 'dead', 'tracks', 'Ian', 'attempt', 'humiliate', 'Ritchie', ""'Welcome"", 'Highness', 'gesture', 'towards', 'Ritchie', 'Do', 'really', 'blame', 'being', 'upset', 'obnoxious', 'juvenile', 'stunt', 'Gillan', '3', 'Ritchie', 'visibly', 'upset', 'Gillan', 'tries', 'convey', 'Gillan', 'back', 'walks', 'away', 'Ritchie', 'throw', 'water', 'Big', 'Deal', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'justified', 'would', 'have', 'slugged', 'him.4', 'Gillan', 'was', 'trying', 'build', 'momentum', 'entrance', 'AND', 'SO', 'WAS', 'RITCHIE', 'BUT', 'Gillan', 'ruined', '5', 'Ritchie', 'IS', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'still', 'fantastic', 'Ian', 'shadow', 'old', 'self', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'why', 'blame', 'Ritchie', 'wanting', 'quit', 'band', 'lead', 'singer', 'vocals', 'have', 'deteriorated', 'so', 'much', 'band', 'legacy', 'would', 'certainly', 'begin', 'suffer', 'not', 'Ian', 'fault', 'singer', 'range', 'get', 'older', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Ritchie', 'make', 'professional', 'decision', 'everyone', 'attacking', '6', 'When', 'saw', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'early', '70', 'Long', 'Beach', 'Arena', 'California', 'crowd', 'photographers', 'were', 'swarming', 'stage', 'directly', 'Ritchie', 'mesmorized', 'lightning', 'leads', 'once', 'awhile', 'throwing', 'guitar', 'up', 'air', 'catching', 'missing', 'note', 'guitar', 'playing', 'legend', 'Ritchie', 'earned', 'respect', ""'Hell"", 'High', 'Water', 'was', 'ruined', 'was', 'Gillan', 'ego']",N/A

571632,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B0000577C9,Danno,"[9, 11]","Deep Purple never got the respect they deserved. They may have written some of the best hard-rock songs to come out of Britain in the early 1970s, and put on some of the fiercest live performances ever. Anyone who saw them in the late 80s triple bill with Aerosmith and Guns and Roses know what a great live band Deep Purple can be. But they never seemed to achieve the critical attention and fan devotion that similar British bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath did. Therefore, I was very excited to see this DVD for sale as so little Purple is available on DVD.Unlike most Purple fans, I could care less about the interpersonal fighting between guitarist Richie Blackmore and the rest of the band. I'm not an employee of theirs and have no stake in the outcome. I just wanted a memorable concert on DVD. Instead, the package is simply average - and for reasons that outweigh the obvious tension between Blackmore and the band. To be blunt, the decision to ruin the flow of the concert by interjecting mini-interviews with the band was a wrongheaded one. It's impossible to watch the concert without being interrupted by yet another member of Deep Purple going down memory lane. The song lyrics are available only as an extra outside the concert and not available while the concert is playing, as is the case with most rock DVDs. The direction is often unimaginative and, I suspect, robbed an exciting concert of much of its punch. There's also a problem with some of the songs being edited or joined in-progress.Don't get me wrong. I can't say I felt ripped off, but I did wonder about all the wrong decisions and misteps made. This is far from the worst Deep Purple show. It just isn't one of their best, and it's sad that this is one of the few shows available for legal purchase by their fans. I would say the highlights of the show lie in Ian Paice's always nimble jazz-influenced drumming, so if you're a drummer you'll get a lot more enjoyment out of this DVD than a casual fan. And, if you stick with the show, you will be treated to a powerhouse jam based around the Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black.""If you're a diehard fan, you'll disagree with me and love every moment of this.

This is an actual DVD, licensed in Brazil (not a boot DVD-R).  It is a professional recording, shot in Copenhagen shortly before Machine Head was released (probably for a television broadcast).  Although the sound and (black & white) video quality are good to fair, the performance is EXCELLENT!  It's the classic lineup at their peak.  The one omission is that they don't play Smoke On The Water.  At the time they probably didn't realize it would be a hit.I wish a major studio would work some techno-magic on the original video source and re-release this.  Anyway...all in all it's in pretty good shape considering it's 30+ years old.  Track list: Highway Star, Strange Kind Of Woman, Child In Time, The Mule, Lazy, Space Truckin', Fireball, (Little Richard's) Lucille, Black Night.  For fans of early Deep Purple this is the one to have.Original review: Great to see the classic lineup.  Ian Gillan had trouble with the ultra high notes but still did an adequate job.

I wanted my first Purple concert to have Blackmore involved, and he makes his presence well noted right in the first song!  He is eccentric, but he is also an incredible, unique guitarist!  In fact, all five of the band members really display their respective talents in this show.  Jon Lord is the best keyboardist yet to emerge from the Classic Era of Rock, and Ian Paice nearly steals the show with his powerful, percussion skills.  I also like the way that the band comments are always put at the end of the songs, so I can just tap the &quot;next&quot; button at any song's finish, and immediately go to the next number.But, it is the magnificent glory of the Deep Purple sound that justifies this purchase.

But let's face it, even the average Deep Purple show is a little special, and to me, this DVD wasn't bad at all. I'll admit that Ritchie Blackmore's antics made it hard at first, but the overall performance still comes across pretty well. Drummer Ian Paice shines in some of the later songs, and the rest of the band (Lord, Glover and Gillan) all try to make up for Ritchie's lack of dedication you might say. Some of Gillan's expressions are a treat, and the overall uniqueness of a Deep Purple happening is captured well on video. Technically it's excellent, nothing too flashy. It's a treat to watch something done by people you know have a feel for Purple's work, which doesn't come off routine looking or full of gimmicks. Overall, this is a pretty good resemblance of the  25th Anniversary tour, just not one of the best moments.

Well &quot;this time&quot; it is the classic MK II lineup of Gillian, Lord, Glover, Paice and Blackmore. This will always be the real Deep Purple and any other lineup is second rate. After watching 2 hours of music, it is again clear that this lineup will always be the most powerful and its most unstable.Tempers and attitudes are hot and so is the music. Ritchie is well, Ritchie and after he decides to show up, he proves why he is who he is and Deep Purple is always the better for it. Ritchie's playing is fierce and percussive. As good as Steve Morse is, he will never have the one thing that makes Ritchie burn, HIS EGO! As the interviews state, Ritchie is a nightmare to work with and is disruptive in everyway. But, it translates on stage to nothing less than a nuclear war as he and the rest of the band prove that they still have the goods and we the listener benefit greatly!The set list is impressive and the sound quality is outstanding. Gillian and Lord are wonderful and Ian Paice is well, the best. Age has tamed them a little as will happen but they were so good to start with that even a slowed down Purple is better than most.So the struggle plays out before our eyes, the Band vs. Blackmore. Back and forth, hook and jab! It is clearly the worst of times for the band but it turns out to be the best of times for us!Enjoy this classic concert and remember the power and the attitude because they never regained it after this!

571652,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B0000577C9,Sky,"[30, 33]","Only 3 stars for Come Hell or High Water is almost being harsh. But Blackmore's behavior during the concert is so outrageous that I was embarrassed for the band just watching the show. I feel sorry for the fans that actually paid to attend the concert who were probably very excited to see a Deep Purple show where all 5 members participated.But really only 4 participated. Those 4 being Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, and Jon Lord. Those guys must have huddled before the show and said, ""let's give these fans a musical performance that they'll never forget."" Whether Blackmore was in the huddle with them or not, one thing is for sure, Blackmore agreed to also give the fans an experience that they'll never forget, but the experience that he provided was how to be a complete jackass...not the experience of the guitar performances that he is legend for.The back jacket of the DVD reads, ""No one who has heard Deep Purple kick off a show with Highway Star will ever forget it...."" Well, I sure won't forget how it was done on this DVD. The band comes out on stage, starts the song, but something's missing...Blackmore is missing! The first minute of the song goes by, but there's no Blackmore; there's no guitar playing; only vocals, keys, bass and drums. At first I thought it was a some sort of prestaged thing where Blackmore would appear with much fanfare. Well, he finally does appear where the guitar solo is supposed to come in, but not with much fanfare. Blackmore is clearly pissed about something and is determined to let everyone in the band and audience know it. He walks on stage, saunters over to the amps, grabs a cup of water that is sitting there, flings it through the air, looks at the other guys in the band as if to say, ""take-that!"", and then he feebly proceeds to play a horrible version of the Highway Star solo. The other guys in the band are visibly exasperated and just roll their eyes.After Highway Star, the DVD breaks to a quick video interview with Gillian, Paice, Lord and Glover where they comment on how something wasn't working between them that night at the Birmingham NEC, UK, on November 9, 1993, and that Blackmore, as he was known to often do, acted ""like an angry little child when he didn't get his way about something"".Clearly, Blackmore indeed didn't get his way about something for the recording of this DVD. The tension on stage was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Blackmore was conspicuously absent from the stage and absent from playing throughout the whole show, and that really took away from the performance. Instead of rocking out through the DVD, I'm sitting there the whole time going, geez what a shame. To be fair, things were working with everyone in the band except just one guy. Gillian, Paice, Lord and Glover did indeed play like it was 1972...they were on.The song list was terrific. They play:1-Highway Star2-Black Night3-Talk About Love4-Twist in the Tale5-Perfect Strangers (Blackmore almost looked as if he njoyed being there for this song.)6-Beethoven7-Knocking at Your Back Door8-Anyone's Daughter9-Child in Time10-Anya11-The Battle Rages On12-Lazy13-Space Truckin'14-Woman from Tokyo15-Paint It Black16-Smoke on the Water.Blackmore couldn't wait to get off the stage. He walked right off after Smoke On The Water...exit stage left; the other guys took some bows and exited stage right.For a 1993 recording, the picture was above average and the sound was very good. You get a superb Dolby 5.1 mix. But the picture quality was brought down a bit by the lighting choice throughout the show; it was as if consideration the night of the show was not given to the fact that the show would be recorded for DVD. The editing was great; you really got to take in each angle before the shot changed.With the short interviews (spliced in between songs instead of as an extra feature which kind of took away from the live performance illusion) the DVD is an even 2 hours long.

Mehaffey ""icomearoundnow""","[0, 0]","""Highway Star"" is the first song on this, and for the first third or so of it they perform as a 4 piece with no guitar anywhere. Then where the organ solo normally is, Blackmore makes his entrance; grabbing the spotlight, charging in with some ferocious guitar flourishes, stalking over to John Lord's side of the stage and marking his territory like a bull terrier,I mean it almost looks like he's going to physically ram into one of the other guys, the look on Roger's face...did I mention this is where Lord's organ solo normally is? After this song there is a brief composite of talking from the Purple guys, ruminating over the difficulties of having a guitar player, guitar player MIA from these segments. This is a great concert. Purple is an incredible buffet of top tier talent, a band so fluid, their influences are trades they have become masters, not hacks at; with a singer who fancies TS Elliot, whiskey and women, I would say in any order.  A band who had gotten more potent with age, and would never approach parody. Ritchie's allegations of nostalgia further fortifying a deep committment to integrity. Ritchie got a cool million just to show up, and deserves respect for walking away from the future cash to pursue his artistic vision. But the parrying and jostling with his bandmates is ever present, and very entertaining, Purple being the one group of guys who can handle said guitar player.  The Purple guys feel slighted by Ritchie's claims, and they shoud be, because it clearly disrespects the verve they put into the new Purple. Two of the new songs, ""Battle"" and ""Anya"" are highlights of the concert, brilliantly maneuvering Zeppelin avenues. And a wicked sense of humor: there's a song that opens with the ""Jaws"" theme that's about uh, well you'll have to see.

571658,A17Z53UM2E111A,B0000577C9,T. P. Watt,"[0, 0]","Well, I will agree with other reviewers that Come Hell Or High Water is illustrative of Blackmore's dissatisfaction (to a degree) with being in Deep Purple by the time 1993 rolled around. He turns up midway through the Highway Star opener, throws a slight tantrum then slightly botches the solo (come on, Ritchie, how many times have you played this tune in the last twenty years?). After that, Blackmore stands fairly still throughout the rest of the gig and slowly but surely begins to get into it, with his playing becoming progressively stronger as the show unfolds. For whatever reason he ducks behind the amps after each tune, but hey, it's just Blackmore being Blackmore. Ian Gillan by this point has a fairly seasoned voice and some of the high notes clearly elude his range so he doesn't bother trying, but this is to be expected with age (he was far more listenable in 1993 then he is these days). The rest of the group are spot on, with Ian Paice really standing out: the guy was still as astounding in 1993 as he ever was. Professionally shot with a solid mix, Come Hell Or High Water overall is a solid live representation of DP circa 1993. A few tunes included in the setlist from the then fresh Battle Rages On album don't really add much to the gig, but there are more than enough classic tunes to make it worthwhile. Not to take away from Steve Morse, Joe Lynn Turner, Rod Evans, Don Airey, David Coverdale, Glenn Hughes or Tommy Bolin, but the Mark 2 lineup was really the only one that ever mattered, and they were still turning in fine shows in the early 1990s.

571659,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0000577C9,trebe,"[2, 2]","One of the pioneers in the formative days of hard rock and heavy metal, Deep Purple has had a long and at times tumultuous history, spanning over thirty years.  With the legendary Mark II lineup of Ian Gillan (vocals), Ian Paice (drums) Jon Lord (organ), Roger Glover (bass) and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Purple produced the classic albums Deep Purple In Rock (1970), Fireball (1971), Machine Head (1972), and Who Do We Think We Are? (1973), before Glover and Gillan split in 1973.  It would take over a decade before the classic lineup would reform for the Perfect Strangers (1984) album.  Gillan was fired in 1989 and was replaced by Joe Lynn Turner, but was back in the band for The Battle Rages On (1993).This performance was in Birmingham, England, on November 9, 1993, on the European leg of a world tour, to support the new album.  Upon completion of the tour, the mercurial Blackmore left the band, perhaps for the final time.  Some 17 years have passed, and Blackmore seems to have left his hard rock days behind, now performing renaissance music with his band, Blackmore's Knight.  So unless Ritchie gives up the minstrel life, this DVD could mark one of his last ever performances with Purple.  Evidence of the guitarist temperamental nature is displayed early, as apparently displeased, Blackmore tosses a cup of water at a camera operator, mid-solo in the opening number.The setlist is a mix of classic tunes the band has been playing for decades, mixed with Perfect Strangers, and Knocking At Your Back Door, from the 1984 reunion album, and A Twist In the Tale, Anya, Talk About Love, and The Battle Rages On, from their latest release.  It's a nice diverse mix of old and new, with the music from the new album being quite strong.  The band also tries to keep things fresh by reworking the arrangements of some of the classic material.At this point in their career, Deep Purple is mostly about the music, not prancing around onstage.  Despite the rocky start, the quintet is in very good form, particularly Ian Gillan who powers through most of the set.  The man still has an amazing set of pipes.  Fortunately Blackmore becomes more animated as the night wears on.  Jon Lord's organ is prominent, although his solos tend to be mostly brief.  Ian Paice and Roger Glover are as always, a solid and dependable rhythm section.  Paice gets a lot done, with a rather minimal kit.  Video coverage of the band is adequate, with lots of wide shots and occasional cuts to close-ups of band members.  The stage isn't very deep, so the band is rather close to the audience.  Lasers employed in their lighting show kind of perk things up a bit.  For the most part, you get a pretty good view of what was one of the quintessential rock bands of the early 70's.  Despite the talents and temperaments of its members, in concept Deep Purple was always very much a band first, and the magic of these five musicians is mostly evident here.  For some perspective, in between some of the songs, the performance cuts away to interview clips with the band (minus Blackmore), discussing various subjects.Known for their extended jams live, the band does a bit of that in their interpretation of the Stones' Paint It Black, and a number called Beethoven, which is basically a reworking of Blackmore's Difficult to Cure instrumental, that finishes as a showcase for Lord's organ playing.  Always a rousing number performed live, the uptempo version of Lazy features Gillan on harmonica, and Ian Paice's drum solo.  Purple tones things down for a fantastic version of Anyone's Daughter, then rocks with some particularly aggressive swagger on the new songs, Talk About Love, Anya, and Twist In The Tale.  Ian Gillan can't quite hit the high notes in the classic, Child In Time, but the still powerful number features some incendiary guitar work from the man in black.  The show finishes with the standard closer Smoke On The Water, after which Blackmore almost immediately exits the stage while his bandmates acknowledge and thank the audience.As perhaps one of Ritchie Blackmore's last performances with Deep Purple, this DVD should be of particular interest to aficionados of the storied Mark II lineup, as even members of the band remark that the musicianship during this tour was among the best in the history of the band.",4,"unless Ritchie gives up the minstrel life, this might be the last Mark II performance for some time...",1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,4318,"['One', 'pioneers', 'formative', 'days', 'hard', 'rock', 'heavy', 'metal', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'had', 'long', 'times', 'tumultuous', 'history', 'spanning', 'thirty', 'years', 'legendary', 'Mark', 'II', 'lineup', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'vocals', 'Ian', 'Paice', 'drums', 'Jon', 'Lord', 'Roger', 'Glover', 'bass', 'Ritchie', 'Blackmore', 'guitar', 'Purple', 'produced', 'classic', 'albums', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'Rock', '1970', 'Fireball', '1971', 'Machine', 'Head', '1972', 'Who', 'Do', 'Think', 'Are', '1973', 'Glover', 'Gillan', 'split', '1973', 'would', 'take', 'over', 'decade', 'classic', 'lineup', 'would', 'reform', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', '1984', 'album', 'Gillan', 'was', 'fired', '1989', 'was', 'replaced', 'Joe', 'Lynn', 'Turner', 'was', 'back', 'band', 'Battle', 'Rages', '1993', '.This', 'performance', 'was', 'Birmingham', 'England', 'November', '9', '1993', 'European', 'leg', 'world', 'tour', 'support', 'new', 'album', 'completion', 'tour', 'mercurial', 'Blackmore', 'left', 'band', 'perhaps', 'final', 'time', '17', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Blackmore', 'have', 'left', 'hard', 'rock', 'days', 'now', 'performing', 'renaissance', 'music', 'band', 'Blackmore', 'Knight', 'So', 'Ritchie', 'up', 'minstrel', 'life', 'DVD', 'could', 'mark', 'one', 'last', 'ever', 'performances', 'Purple', 'Evidence', 'guitarist', 'temperamental', 'nature', 'displayed', 'early', 'apparently', 'displeased', 'Blackmore', 'cup', 'water', 'camera', 'operator', 'mid-solo', 'opening', 'number.The', 'setlist', 'mix', 'classic', 'tunes', 'band', 'been', 'playing', 'decades', 'mixed', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'Knocking', 'Your', 'Back', 'Door', '1984', 'reunion', 'album', 'Twist', 'Tale', 'Anya', 'Talk', 'Love', 'Battle', 'Rages', 'latest', 'release', 'nice', 'diverse', 'mix', 'old', 'new', 'music', 'new', 'album', 'being', 'quite', 'strong', 'band', 'also', 'keep', 'things', 'fresh', 'reworking', 'arrangements', 'classic', 'material.At', 'point', 'career', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'mostly', 'music', 'not', 'prancing', 'around', 'onstage', 'rocky', 'start', 'quintet', 'very', 'good', 'form', 'particularly', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'who', 'most', 'set', 'man', 'still', 'amazing', 'set', 'pipes', 'Fortunately', 'becomes', 'more', 'animated', 'night', 'wears', 'Jon', 'Lord', 'organ', 'prominent', 'solos', 'tend', 'be', 'mostly', 'brief', 'Ian', 'Paice', 'Roger', 'Glover', 'are', 'always', 'solid', 'dependable', 'rhythm', 'section', 'Paice', 'lot', 'done', 'rather', 'minimal', 'kit', 'Video', 'coverage', 'band', 'adequate', 'lots', 'wide', 'shots', 'occasional', 'cuts', 'close-ups', 'band', 'members', 'stage', ""n't"", 'very', 'deep', 'band', 'rather', 'close', 'audience', 'Lasers', 'employed', 'lighting', 'show', 'kind', 'perk', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'most', 'part', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'view', 'what', 'was', 'one', 'quintessential', 'rock', 'bands', 'early', '70', 'talents', 'temperaments', 'members', 'concept', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'was', 'always', 'very', 'much', 'band', 'first', 'magic', 'five', 'musicians', 'mostly', 'evident', 'here', 'perspective', 'songs', 'performance', 'away', 'interview', 'clips', 'band', 'Blackmore', 'discussing', 'various', 'subjects.Known', 'extended', 'jams', 'live', 'band', 'bit', 'interpretation', 'Stones', 'Paint', 'Black', 'number', 'called', 'Beethoven', 'basically', 'reworking', 'Blackmore', 'Difficult', 'Cure', 'instrumental', 'showcase', 'Lord', 'organ', 'playing', 'Always', 'rousing', 'number', 'performed', 'live', 'uptempo', 'version', 'Lazy', 'features', 'Gillan', 'harmonica', 'Ian', 'Paice', 'drum', 'solo', 'Purple', 'tones', 'things', 'down', 'fantastic', 'version', 'Anyone', 'Daughter', 'then', 'particularly', 'aggressive', 'swagger', 'new', 'songs', 'Talk', 'Love', 'Anya', 'Twist', 'Tale', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'classic', 'Child', 'Time', 'still', 'powerful', 'number', 'incendiary', 'guitar', 'work', 'man', 'black', 'show', 'standard', 'closer', 'Smoke', 'Water', 'Blackmore', 'almost', 'immediately', 'stage', 'bandmates', 'acknowledge', 'thank', 'audience.As', 'perhaps', 'one', 'Ritchie', 'Blackmore', 'last', 'performances', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'particular', 'interest', 'aficionados', 'storied', 'Mark', 'II', 'lineup', 'even', 'members', 'band', 'remark', 'musicianship', 'tour', 'was', 'best', 'history', 'band']",N/A

As far as his guitar playing goes, he has few, if any, equals (IMO). Like a previous reviewer, I also feel Clapton is way overrated, for example, but that is beside the point. Before you skewer Blackmore for his admittedly lousy on-stage behavior during this concert, consider a couple of points.First, we are all assuming he was the unique burr under the band's saddle. Fault is never unilateral. For all we know, Ian Gillan (for example), might be a royal pain, in his own right. I can't believe it was Four Saints and a Blackmore. I'm not saying Richie is Mother Theresa, I'm not that naive. Just that other people can be jerks, too, at times.Perhaps more importantly, tho, of all the members of DP, regardless of &quot;Mark&quot;, he is the only one to ever really make it on his own, outside the group - with the single exception of Ian Gillan in Superstar, which was a one-time shot, and that he only performed in and didn't create. Sure, Glover, Paice and Lord have all done substantial first-rate moonlighting, Glover has done some producing, and Lord wrote the group's Symphony, but none of them have been the spark for anything truly new and lasting, as writers and performers, outside of Deep Purple.Blackmore not only helped created DP, but also Rainbow, which he led to (arguably) even surpass DP for quality. I know that is a very strong statement, and I'm not sure I even buy it myself. BUT, he DID create a second major rock group. Nobody else in the band ever came close to doing so.Then he went on to help form and flesh out Blackmore's Night, with a style of music that is 100% different from anywhere he has been before. And it's pretty darn good music, too.And he played behind Pat Boone........... shiverrrrr.........;-)The bottom line might well be something that Roger Glover said in his interview on the DVD, that Richie considered the tour to be strictly nostalgia {with nothing new and energizing in it). Given his track record for stretching his musical envelope, how could he NOT feel trapped in something that was just old news, replayed endlessly, in his eyes?Maybe he WAS just a jerk, I dunno. But I do think these other points should be taken into consideration before passing judgement on him.",4,"Equal time, maybe........",1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,2453,"['years', 'Richie', 'Blackmore', 'gained', 'reputation', 'being', 'difficult', 'work', 'egomaniacal', 'petulant', 'etc.', 'etc', 'order', 'make', 'labels', 'stick', 'tho', 'have', 'have', 'something/someone', 'compare', 'As', 'far', 'guitar', 'playing', 'few', 'equals', 'IMO', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'also', 'feel', 'Clapton', 'way', 'overrated', 'example', 'beside', 'point', 'skewer', 'admittedly', 'lousy', 'on-stage', 'behavior', 'concert', 'consider', 'couple', 'points.First', 'are', 'assuming', 'was', 'unique', 'burr', 'band', 'saddle', 'Fault', 'never', 'unilateral', 'know', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'example', 'might', 'be', 'royal', 'pain', 'own', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'Four', 'Saints', 'Blackmore', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Richie', 'Mother', 'Theresa', ""'m"", 'not', 'naive', 'Just', 'other', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'jerks', 'too', 'times.Perhaps', 'more', 'importantly', 'tho', 'members', 'DP', 'regardless', 'quot', 'Mark', 'quot', 'only', 'one', 'ever', 'really', 'make', 'own', 'group', 'single', 'exception', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'Superstar', 'was', 'one-time', 'shot', 'only', 'performed', 'did', ""n't"", 'create', 'Sure', 'Glover', 'Paice', 'Lord', 'have', 'done', 'substantial', 'first-rate', 'moonlighting', 'Glover', 'done', 'producing', 'Lord', 'wrote', 'group', 'Symphony', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'spark', 'anything', 'truly', 'new', 'lasting', 'writers', 'performers', 'Deep', 'Purple.Blackmore', 'not', 'only', 'helped', 'created', 'DP', 'also', 'Rainbow', 'led', 'arguably', 'even', 'surpass', 'DP', 'quality', 'know', 'very', 'strong', 'statement', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'buy', 'BUT', 'DID', 'create', 'second', 'major', 'rock', 'group', 'Nobody', 'else', 'band', 'ever', 'came', 'close', 'doing', 'so.Then', 'went', 'help', 'form', 'flesh', 'out', 'Blackmore', 'Night', 'style', 'music', '100', '%', 'different', 'anywhere', 'been', 'before', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'music', 'too.And', 'played', 'behind', 'Pat', 'Boone', '..', 'shiverrrrr', 'bottom', 'line', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'something', 'Roger', 'Glover', 'said', 'interview', 'DVD', 'Richie', 'considered', 'tour', 'be', 'strictly', 'nostalgia', 'nothing', 'new', 'energizing', 'Given', 'track', 'record', 'stretching', 'musical', 'envelope', 'how', 'could', 'NOT', 'feel', 'trapped', 'something', 'was', 'just', 'old', 'news', 'replayed', 'endlessly', 'eyes', 'Maybe', 'WAS', 'just', 'jerk', 'dunno', 'do', 'think', 'other', 'points', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'consideration', 'passing', 'judgement']",N/A
