Moon,"[42, 42]","It is rather unclear what the intentions of this grotesquely abridged version of Life on Earth were, but what stands out above everything else is that this two video tape set does little justice to the original series.  I had seen several episodes complete while in college and a few years back purchased this edited version--knowing quite well it was edited.  But the severity of the cuts was never clear until viewed side-by-side with the original version.  It might seem that the episodes were perhaps 30 minutes long but instead they were a full 50 minutes.  Given that many of the episodes on this tape are little over 10 or 20 minutes, you can imagine just how much has been lost.And what did they choose to lose?  As another review made clear, the most interesting, the most novel and the most educational elements were discarded leaving a program that is still interesting if nothing else is available, but chopping out almost everything that made this program one of a kind.The truth is, unlike many of the other fantastic 'life' installments, 'Life On Earth' is quite intellectual, and really oriented toward the college level viewer.  That doesn't mean that younger people won't like it, but seeing it next to 'Life of Mammals' for instance, the difference in the target audience is abundantly clear.  Unfortunately, almost all the college level material is dropped from the 4 hour version.  Comparison to fossils, extensive discussions of evolution, co-evolution, speculations on the adaptive function of certain forms...almost all of this is gone!I for one am a fan of all Attenborough's work, but 'Life on Earth' is by far one of the most amazing efforts in nature films and probably Attenborough's crowning achievement.  It is (as tht title suggests) an overview of the world's natural history, crammed into thirteen fifty minute episodes with beautiful examples of every kind of life from all over the world.  In the scope of science/nature documentaries, it is undoubtedly the finest of its kind.For those who question where they might be able to purchase the entire series, I would suggest checking Amazon's UK branch as the BBC has issued the entire series there (though I don't imagine US machines will play it.)",3,like reducing Moby Dick to the first and last 50 pages...,1063843200,"09 18, 2003",2003,2232,"['rather', 'unclear', 'what', 'intentions', 'grotesquely', 'abridged', 'version', 'Life', 'Earth', 'were', 'what', 'out', 'everything', 'else', 'two', 'video', 'tape', 'set', 'little', 'justice', 'original', 'series', 'had', 'seen', 'several', 'episodes', 'complete', 'college', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'purchased', 'edited', 'version', 'knowing', 'quite', 'well', 'was', 'edited', 'severity', 'cuts', 'was', 'never', 'clear', 'viewed', 'side-by-side', 'original', 'version', 'might', 'seem', 'episodes', 'were', 'perhaps', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'instead', 'were', 'full', '50', 'minutes', 'Given', 'many', 'episodes', 'tape', 'are', 'little', '10', '20', 'minutes', 'can', 'imagine', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'been', 'lost.And', 'what', 'did', 'choose', 'lose', 'review', 'made', 'clear', 'most', 'interesting', 'most', 'novel', 'most', 'educational', 'elements', 'were', 'discarded', 'leaving', 'program', 'still', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'else', 'available', 'chopping', 'out', 'almost', 'everything', 'made', 'program', 'one', 'kind.The', 'truth', 'many', 'other', 'fantastic', ""'life"", 'installments', 'Earth', 'quite', 'intellectual', 'really', 'oriented', 'college', 'level', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'mean', 'younger', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'next', ""'Life"", 'Mammals', 'instance', 'difference', 'target', 'audience', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'Unfortunately', 'almost', 'college', 'level', 'material', 'dropped', '4', 'hour', 'version', 'Comparison', 'fossils', 'extensive', 'discussions', 'evolution', 'co-evolution', 'speculations', 'adaptive', 'function', 'certain', 'forms', 'almost', 'gone', 'one', 'am', 'fan', 'Attenborough', 'work', 'Earth', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'efforts', 'nature', 'films', 'probably', 'Attenborough', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'tht', 'title', 'overview', 'world', 'natural', 'history', 'crammed', 'thirteen', 'fifty', 'minute', 'episodes', 'beautiful', 'examples', 'kind', 'life', 'world', 'scope', 'science/nature', 'documentaries', 'undoubtedly', 'finest', 'kind.For', 'who', 'question', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'purchase', 'entire', 'series', 'would', 'suggest', 'checking', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'branch', 'BBC', 'issued', 'entire', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'US', 'machines', 'will', 'play']",N/A
237838,AC9IDFCD43GHP,630027134X,Michael J. Holly,"[24, 24]","I bought this set from Amazon 4 years ago and watched it.  It is an extremely edited version of the 13 part tv series by Sir David Attenborough.  I wqs disppointed that most episodes were edited down and many neat parts, such as fossil discussions and habitat discussions, were left out.  The complete series on DVD is available in the UK, but, unfortunately, not available in the uS.  However, a Chinese DVD business sells the complete unedited series on a DVD set along with Living Planet and private Life of Plants.  I recently won a copy of the set from E-Bay and will be getting that soon in the mail.",3,OK Intro to Hit Attenborough Show,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,606,"['bought', 'set', 'Amazon', '4', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', 'extremely', 'edited', 'version', '13', 'part', 'tv', 'series', 'Sir', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'wqs', 'disppointed', 'most', 'episodes', 'were', 'edited', 'down', 'many', 'neat', 'parts', 'such', 'fossil', 'discussions', 'habitat', 'discussions', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'available', 'UK', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'available', 'uS', 'However', 'Chinese', 'DVD', 'business', 'complete', 'unedited', 'series', 'DVD', 'set', 'Living', 'Planet', 'private', 'Life', 'Plants', 'recently', 'won', 'copy', 'set', 'E-Bay', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'soon', 'mail']",N/A

It is still an acceptable review of the evolution of life on our planet with an emphasis on the vertebrates. However, it is too brief in many aspects. The original series was outstanding! As always Attenborough has the keen ability to provide an enormous amount of factual information in regards to the different adaptations found in animals as he unfolds the story of life on our planet. It would be appropriate to give access to the full series in the near future. It is embarassing that such a great documentary is not available.

237840,A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ,630027134X,Mr. A. Pomeroy,"[20, 20]","'Life on Earth' was quite an event in 1979 - the BBC took and gamble, gave their natural history department a blank cheque and several years, and in return they received the first of the 'David Attenborough Natural History Blockbusters', a hugely-popular sequence which has gone on, every five or so years, to include 'The Living Planet', 'The Trials and Life', 'The Secret Life of Plants' and most recently 'The Blue Planet'.'Life on Earth' is essentially an overview of all the above, no less than the story of all life on earth, especially some of the most exotic species in the harshest of environments. 'The Bit with the Apes' became an iconic piece of television and Attenborough himself became famous through his breathy, hushed narration and propensity for being calm whilst exploring bat caves. Attenborough wrote the series, too, and is truly a God amongst men (he was knighted in 1985).The original series consisted of thirteen fifty-minute episodes. As mentioned in the reviews here, this release is unfortunately edited down to just four hours - similar treatment having been meted out to 'The Living Planet' as well, although there's currently a...boxed set of all the tape available right here. Presumably a DVD boxed set (with commentary to show us which species and environments have subsequently died off) will appear at some point in the future, as I can't imagine it being the same with half of the series missing.",2,Life on Zanzibar,1010016000,"01 3, 2002",2002,1434,"[""'Life"", 'Earth', 'was', 'quite', 'event', '1979', 'BBC', 'took', 'gamble', 'gave', 'natural', 'history', 'department', 'blank', 'cheque', 'several', 'years', 'return', 'received', 'first', ""'David"", 'Attenborough', 'Natural', 'History', 'Blockbusters', 'hugely-popular', 'sequence', 'gone', 'five', 'so', 'years', 'include', ""'The"", 'Living', 'Planet', 'Trials', 'Life', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Plants', 'most', 'recently', 'Blue', 'Planet', ""'Life"", 'Earth', 'essentially', 'overview', 'above', 'less', 'story', 'life', 'earth', 'especially', 'most', 'exotic', 'species', 'harshest', 'environments', 'Bit', 'Apes', 'became', 'iconic', 'piece', 'television', 'Attenborough', 'became', 'famous', 'breathy', 'hushed', 'narration', 'propensity', 'being', 'calm', 'whilst', 'exploring', 'bat', 'caves', 'Attenborough', 'wrote', 'series', 'too', 'truly', 'God', 'amongst', 'men', 'was', 'knighted', '1985', '.The', 'original', 'series', 'consisted', 'thirteen', 'fifty-minute', 'episodes', 'mentioned', 'reviews', 'here', 'release', 'unfortunately', 'edited', 'down', 'just', 'four', 'hours', 'similar', 'treatment', 'having', 'been', 'meted', 'out', ""'The"", 'Living', 'Planet', 'as', 'well', 'currently', 'boxed', 'set', 'tape', 'available', 'right', 'here', 'Presumably', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'commentary', 'show', 'species', 'environments', 'have', 'subsequently', 'died', 'off', 'will', 'appear', 'point', 'future', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'being', 'same', 'half', 'series', 'missing']",N/A
