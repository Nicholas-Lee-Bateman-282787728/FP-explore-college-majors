What I gather most from films like these is how hard other people have it, and how spoiled we are.  We complain about everything, and yet others with so little are so much happier than us.",5,Quality,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,322,"['watch', 'films', 'kids', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'least', 'something', 'else', 'eye', 'recommend', 'What', 'gather', 'most', 'films', 'how', 'hard', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'how', 'spoiled', 'are', 'complain', 'everything', 'yet', 'others', 'so', 'little', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'happier']",N/A

Eyon ""Little Raven""","[4, 5]","The DVD I saw had a very grainy image which proved distracting at times (such as the scene of a downpour -- was that laboratory-inserted rain or graininess?). The poor imagery kept me from becoming totally involved.Another distraction was the use of a first-person narration voiced, oddly enuf, by James Mason (I guess there were no Iranian actors available back in 1976). He supposedly narrated the actual thoughts of the tribe's leader -- but that wasn't stated anywhere. Either way, that seems counter to the principle stated at the beginning of the film that nothing in this film was faked or re-enacted.Because the film concentrates on the annual trek from the low to high pastures, much cultural detail is sacrificed. In fact, many curious events are left unexplained. Often, I felt like a young child -- seeing but not understanding.At least, the individuals themselves are interesting. The arrogant leader. His cynical comments on the people around him and of people he meets along the way. The costumes. The incredible, upright posture of these nomads. The protesting pack animals.But overpowering it all is the breathtaking trek over land and river, up the steep Zagros Mountains and over it's snowy summit to the welcoming summer pastures. There's a brief scene that seems to distill that effort in which a young girl piggy-backs a child seemingly half her size while working her way up the precipitous mountainside.A silent documentary calledGrass: A Nation's Battle For Lifewas produced on this same tribe and their trek 50 years earlier.(According to Wikipedia, as of 2006 a small percentage of Bakhtiari still made the journey -- but with transport for the herds and they didn't go barefoot in the snow.)",3,Glimpses of a primitive lifestyle -- compromised by production flaws,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,1719,"['DVD', 'saw', 'had', 'very', 'grainy', 'image', 'proved', 'distracting', 'times', 'such', 'scene', 'downpour', 'was', 'laboratory-inserted', 'rain', 'graininess', 'poor', 'imagery', 'kept', 'becoming', 'totally', 'involved.Another', 'distraction', 'was', 'use', 'first-person', 'narration', 'voiced', 'oddly', 'enuf', 'James', 'Mason', 'guess', 'were', 'Iranian', 'actors', 'available', 'back', '1976', 'supposedly', 'narrated', 'actual', 'thoughts', 'tribe', 'leader', 'was', ""n't"", 'stated', 'anywhere', 'way', 'counter', 'principle', 'stated', 'beginning', 'film', 'nothing', 'film', 'was', 'faked', 're-enacted.Because', 'film', 'annual', 'trek', 'low', 'high', 'pastures', 'much', 'cultural', 'detail', 'sacrificed', 'fact', 'many', 'curious', 'events', 'are', 'left', 'unexplained', 'Often', 'felt', 'young', 'child', 'seeing', 'not', 'understanding.At', 'least', 'individuals', 'are', 'interesting', 'arrogant', 'leader', 'cynical', 'comments', 'people', 'people', 'way', 'costumes', 'incredible', 'upright', 'posture', 'nomads', 'protesting', 'pack', 'animals.But', 'overpowering', 'breathtaking', 'trek', 'land', 'river', 'up', 'steep', 'Zagros', 'Mountains', 'snowy', 'summit', 'welcoming', 'summer', 'pastures', 'brief', 'scene', 'distill', 'effort', 'young', 'girl', 'piggy-backs', 'child', 'seemingly', 'half', 'size', 'working', 'way', 'precipitous', 'mountainside.A', 'silent', 'documentary', 'calledGrass', 'Nation', 'Battle', 'Lifewas', 'produced', 'same', 'tribe', 'trek', '50', 'years', 'earlier', 'According', 'Wikipedia', '2006', 'small', 'percentage', 'Bakhtiari', 'still', 'made', 'journey', 'transport', 'herds', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'barefoot', 'snow']",N/A
475153,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6305741700,Lawyeraau,"[19, 19]","This is an engrossing documentary of the Bakhtiari migration in which about 500,000 men, women, and children, along with approximately one million animals, spend eight weeks of hardship in their struggle to cross the Zagros mountains in order to reach summer pastures for their livestock.Their two hundred miles odyssey is told in the words of the leader of the Babahdi tribe. His words are voiced over by actor James Mason. His story is as compelling, as it is amazing. It is difficult to believe that a people would so endure a journey of such hardship year after year.There is no road through the mountain, only trails or passages worn over time. It is, indeed, rough and rugged terrain over which to cross. The people climb, unroped, these 15,000 foot peaks, herding along their livestock, in clothing and footwear that does not inure them to the ravages of frostbite and illness. You see young children herding animals on precipices that would give most people pause.It is a primitive, yet communal way of life. The film provides the viewer with a fascinating glimpse into a lifestyle which would be foreign to most. It is compelling, documentary film- making at its best. It is a film that would appeal to all those interested in other cultures, as well as in the human condition.",5,A TRIP TO BE REMEMBERED...,978134400,"12 30, 2000",2000,1286,"['engrossing', 'documentary', 'Bakhtiari', 'migration', '500,000', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'approximately', 'one', 'million', 'animals', 'spend', 'eight', 'weeks', 'hardship', 'struggle', 'cross', 'Zagros', 'mountains', 'order', 'reach', 'summer', 'pastures', 'livestock.Their', 'two', 'hundred', 'miles', 'odyssey', 'told', 'words', 'leader', 'Babahdi', 'tribe', 'words', 'are', 'voiced', 'actor', 'James', 'Mason', 'story', 'compelling', 'amazing', 'difficult', 'believe', 'people', 'would', 'so', 'endure', 'journey', 'such', 'hardship', 'year', 'road', 'mountain', 'only', 'passages', 'worn', 'time', 'indeed', 'rough', 'rugged', 'terrain', 'cross', 'people', 'climb', 'unroped', '15,000', 'foot', 'peaks', 'herding', 'along', 'livestock', 'clothing', 'footwear', 'not', 'inure', 'ravages', 'frostbite', 'illness', 'see', 'young', 'children', 'herding', 'animals', 'precipices', 'would', 'give', 'most', 'people', 'pause.It', 'primitive', 'yet', 'communal', 'way', 'life', 'film', 'viewer', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'lifestyle', 'would', 'be', 'foreign', 'most', 'compelling', 'documentary', 'film-', 'making', 'best', 'film', 'would', 'appeal', 'interested', 'other', 'cultures', 'as', 'well', 'human', 'condition']",N/A

It is described as 110 minutes in length, with a release date of 6/6/2000. Narration by James Mason (who died in 1984).I already have another documentary about the Bakhtiari migrations, entitled, not surprisingly, ""Bakhtiari Migration""  also directed by  Howarth, with a running time  of just  52 minutes. Its also for sale on Amazon.I wonder if the first may be a different release, with additional footage  shot at the same time as ""Bakhtiari Migration."".  If anyone knows,  I'd appreciate  their input.Finally, there is the 1925 documentary (silent)  ""Grass: A Nation's Battle For Survival""  by the great early documentarians Marian C. Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack  (who by the way did the 1933 ""King Kong"").The two films I already own are thoroughly engrossing and are examples of the best in early documentary film-making.I hope someone can comment on my question.  And I also wish Amazon would be more precise in their product descriptions when it comes to pertinent dates. Date of production, date of release, and edition date all all important, and often separate and distinct.  Example: ""Battleship Potemkin"" which has several great editions by Kino (including a new blu-ray edition) which  put to shame all the others of inferior quality.",4,There Are Several Bakhtiari Migration Documentaries,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,1448,"['have', 'weakness', 'older', 'documentaries', 'noted', 'one', 'searching', 'something', 'else', 'Amazon.This', 'film', 'entitled', 'People', 'Wind', '1976', 'directed', 'Anthony', 'Howarth', 'described', '110', 'minutes', 'length', 'release', 'date', '6/6/2000', 'Narration', 'James', 'Mason', 'who', 'died', '1984', '.I', 'already', 'have', 'documentary', 'Bakhtiari', 'migrations', 'entitled', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Bakhtiari', 'Migration', 'also', 'directed', 'Howarth', 'running', 'time', 'just', '52', 'minutes', 'also', 'sale', 'Amazon.I', 'wonder', 'first', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'release', 'additional', 'footage', 'shot', 'same', 'time', 'Bakhtiari', 'Migration.', 'anyone', ""'d"", 'appreciate', 'input.Finally', '1925', 'documentary', 'silent', 'Grass', 'Nation', 'Battle', 'Survival', 'great', 'early', 'documentarians', 'Marian', 'C.', 'Cooper', 'Ernest', 'Schoedsack', 'who', 'way', 'did', '1933', 'King', 'Kong', '.The', 'two', 'films', 'already', 'own', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'are', 'examples', 'best', 'early', 'documentary', 'film-making.I', 'hope', 'someone', 'can', 'comment', 'question', 'also', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'precise', 'product', 'descriptions', 'when', 'pertinent', 'dates', 'Date', 'production', 'date', 'release', 'edition', 'date', 'important', 'often', 'separate', 'distinct', 'Example', 'Battleship', 'Potemkin', 'several', 'great', 'editions', 'Kino', 'including', 'new', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'put', 'shame', 'others', 'inferior', 'quality']",N/A
