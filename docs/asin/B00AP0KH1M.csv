A lot of calls including bad ones were made towards them, and a few for the Ravens. By halftime, it was 21-6. But by the second half, the 49ers were only dominating and finally made it a game worth watching. However I give this a bad review because of the referees hired for this game, especially for like around the last 2 minutes.I mean seriously, any football fan could tell you that they costed the 49ers the Super Bowl win. Especially when the Ravens weren't called with that holding penalty for pulling the 49ers reciever jersey to knock him down.

1614686,AOWZ87AGIR2VU,B00AP0KH1M,"Paul Bellocq ""pmbellocq""","[20, 21]","I found myself in the unlikely position of a New Orleans Saints fan who plunked down a nice chunk of change to attend Super Bowl XLVII and rooting for both teams. On one hand, I was overjoyed beyond explanation that the 49ers had kept our arch rival Atlanta Falcons away from a Super Bowl on our own turf. I also have become a fan of the young superstar Colin Kaepernik, who played his 10th NFL start in the Super Bowl. On the other hand, I was also rooting for Ray Lewis, Michael Ohr, Jacoby Jones, and Ed Reed on the Ravens' side. I wound up sitting in the center of the Poydras Street end zone Loge (mid-level). From this vantage point, I could clearly see that Colin was an absolute nervous wreck for the entire first half, changing almost every play at the line and nearly running out the play clock each time. A 49er lady fan also noted the same thing. Half time did not solve his problem, and the Ravens were ahead 28-6 when the lights went out at 1:38 into the third quarter. This 34-minute power outage finally gave Colin time to relax, and his stats from this point on were actually better than MVP Flacco's! Colin is a future hall-of-famer in the making, but the Ravens were destined to win this year. Had Colin not overthrown Crabtree for a touchdown on that last fourth down, there would have still been enough time on the clock for Flacco to drive his team back for the winning field goal or better. Sitting amongst some of the most passionate fans in the NFL for this Super Bowl was a truly wonderful experience that I will never forget!Since I attended the game, I was hoping to see a good bit of it on this video, so I jumped to that part as soon as I got it. To my surprise, the final game is condensed into only 14 minutes, which does not do it justice. However, each of the regular season games as well as the three playoff games are also condensed in such a fashion to show the Ravens slow march to the Lombardi trophy. What is shown in each of the games that is not seen in regular broadcasts is the dialogue on the field between players, coaches, and referees. This is what makes this video a great viewing experience, getting quite emotional at times.For those wanting to see the entire game, a 4-DVD set will supposedly be released in June, showing all of the post season games for the Ravens in their entirety. Another angle is the 23-DVD set of 46 Super Bowls, billed as the Ultimate Collection.You don't have to be a Ravens' fan to appreciate this DVD, just a lover of pro football legends.",4,For Every Fan of Pro Football,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,2518,"['found', 'unlikely', 'position', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Saints', 'fan', 'who', 'plunked', 'down', 'nice', 'chunk', 'change', 'attend', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XLVII', 'rooting', 'teams', 'one', 'hand', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'explanation', '49ers', 'had', 'kept', 'arch', 'rival', 'Atlanta', 'Falcons', 'away', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'own', 'turf', 'also', 'have', 'become', 'fan', 'young', 'superstar', 'Colin', 'Kaepernik', 'who', 'played', '10th', 'NFL', 'start', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'also', 'rooting', 'Ray', 'Lewis', 'Michael', 'Ohr', 'Jacoby', 'Jones', 'Ed', 'Reed', 'Ravens', 'side', 'wound', 'up', 'sitting', 'center', 'Poydras', 'Street', 'end', 'zone', 'Loge', 'mid-level', 'vantage', 'point', 'could', 'clearly', 'see', 'Colin', 'was', 'absolute', 'nervous', 'wreck', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'changing', 'almost', 'play', 'line', 'nearly', 'running', 'out', 'play', 'clock', 'time', '49er', 'lady', 'fan', 'also', 'noted', 'same', 'thing', 'Half', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'solve', 'problem', 'Ravens', 'were', 'ahead', '28-6', 'when', 'lights', 'went', 'out', '1:38', 'third', 'quarter', '34-minute', 'power', 'outage', 'finally', 'gave', 'Colin', 'time', 'relax', 'stats', 'point', 'were', 'actually', 'better', 'MVP', 'Flacco', 'Colin', 'future', 'hall-of-famer', 'making', 'Ravens', 'were', 'destined', 'win', 'year', 'Had', 'Colin', 'not', 'overthrown', 'Crabtree', 'touchdown', 'last', 'fourth', 'down', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'enough', 'time', 'clock', 'Flacco', 'drive', 'team', 'back', 'winning', 'field', 'goal', 'better', 'Sitting', 'most', 'passionate', 'fans', 'NFL', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'was', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'attended', 'game', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'good', 'bit', 'video', 'so', 'jumped', 'part', 'as', 'soon', 'got', 'surprise', 'final', 'game', 'condensed', 'only', '14', 'minutes', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'However', 'regular', 'season', 'games', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'playoff', 'games', 'are', 'also', 'condensed', 'such', 'fashion', 'show', 'Ravens', 'slow', 'march', 'Lombardi', 'trophy', 'What', 'shown', 'games', 'not', 'seen', 'regular', 'broadcasts', 'dialogue', 'field', 'players', 'coaches', 'referees', 'what', 'video', 'great', 'viewing', 'experience', 'getting', 'quite', 'emotional', 'times.For', 'wanting', 'see', 'entire', 'game', '4-DVD', 'set', 'will', 'supposedly', 'be', 'released', 'June', 'showing', 'post', 'season', 'games', 'Ravens', 'entirety', 'angle', '23-DVD', 'set', '46', 'Super', 'Bowls', 'billed', 'Ultimate', 'Collection.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Ravens', 'fan', 'appreciate', 'DVD', 'just', 'lover', 'pro', 'football', 'legends']",NFL Super Bowl XLVII Champions: 2012 Baltimore Ravens

1614689,A1537KCD6LBWGI,B00AP0KH1M,steve_manassas,"[17, 26]","I watched the entire game (and recorded the whole thing on a DVD-VR, except for Beyonc&eacute; Knowles' dreadful halftime show; later, I edited out the commercials and the power failure break). I kept the TV sound off and listened to Gerry Sandusky (no relation to the disgraced former Penn State assistant coach), former Raven Qadry Ismail, and former Baltimore Colt Stan White, on Baltimore's 98ROCK (WIYY), rather than the second-rate ""See B.S."" broadcasters.The Ravens jumped out to a 21-6 lead at halftime, and when Jacoby Jones' 108-yard kick return expanded the lead to 28-6 early in the third quarter, I thought things were well in hand, although I expected the Niners to maybe score a touchdown or two.  But after the power failure, the 49ers made it a lot closer than it should have been, although it is standard operating procedure for the Ravens to jump out to a big lead, and then have the other team come back and make it close.  Fortunately, the Ravens' defense held on with a tremendous goal-line stand, and won the game 34-31, giving Ray Lewis' career a proper send-off, allowing Gerry Sandusky to shout ""The hay's in the barn!"" for a final time this season, and giving the Ravens their second Super Bowl win (the first was in SB XXXV, 34-7 over the Giants), Baltimore's third Super Bowl win (counting the Colts' 16-13 win over Dallas in Super Bowl V), and the city's sixth NFL title (the Colts won back-to-back NFL titles over the Giants in the pre-Super Bowl era (1958-59), and won a third NFL title (ironically, defeating Art Modell's Cleveland Browns) in 1968, though they lost Super Bowl III to the AFL's New York Jets).  And, if you count the College Park-based Baltimore Stars, who won the final USFL title in 1985, and the CFL's Baltimore Stallions, who, in 1995, became the first (and probably last) non-Canadian team to win the Grey Cup, that gives Baltimore eight football titles in all, in three different leagues.If Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco - the best quarterback to wear a Baltimore uniform since the late Hall of Famer Johnny Unitas - isn't an elite quarterback by now, then I don't know what an elite quarterback is.  UPDATE:  With his new six-year contract - the largest ever given to an NFL player - Joe is definitely in the elite now, at least moneywise, though he did not have an elite season in 2013.  Jacoby Jones finished third on ""Dancing With The Stars,"" but returned to the Ravens, and completed the 2013 season.Unfortunately, Buck Showalter's other Birds (the Orioles) did not match the Ravens' success in 2013.  They did have their second straight winning season, finishing 85-77, but tied for third place in the American League East with the hated New York Yankees. They did take two out of three from the defending World Champion San Francisco Giants in a three-game interleague series at AT&T; Park.  The Giants also failed to make the postseason, as did the Birds' Beltway neighbors, the Washington Nationals.  As for the Ravens, they had a disappointing 2013 season, finishing with an 8-8 record, and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2007, when Brian Billick was fired as head coach. That's not as bad though, as the Washington Deadskins, who finished 3-13, and Mike Shanahan was given his walking papers by Danny Boy Snyder.  At this point, RG III - called ""SuperBob"" by sportswriter Thom Loverro - looks like a one-season wonder. Rosta ruck, Jay Gruden - you're going to need it.The DVD of the game is excellent, in keeping with NFL Films' usually high standards.  Narrated by actor, Baltimore native, and Orioles/Ravens fan Josh Charles, the film features plenty of game highlights, including a generous helping of Gerry Sandusky's play-by-play (""The hay's in the barn!""), plus some great music.  Bonus features include highlights of Super Bowl Media Day and the Super Bowl post-game ceremony, interviews with Head Coach John Harbaugh (conducted by Fox Sports analyst Brian Billick, Harbaugh's predecessor as Ravens Head Coach, and the winner of Super Bowl XXXV) and proud parents Jack and Jackie Harbaugh, plus features on John and Jim Harbaugh's sibling rivalry, Ravens rookie linebacker Courtney Upshaw's journey to the Super Bowl, and a Harbaugh family update.NFL: Baltimore Ravens: Road to XLVII, the four-DVD set of the four Ravens playoff games (just the unembellished CBS broadcasts, nothing more) is currently available, but this DVD should be more than enough for most Ravens fans.Okay, let's follow the bouncing football, and sing ""The Baltimore Fight Song"" (a.k.a. ""Let's Go You [Baltimore] Colts,"" with new Ravens lyrics), which the team has used since the 2010 season:Original words and music by Jo Lombardi and Benjamin KlasmerAdapted and arranged by John Ziemann and Todd Clontz""Baltimore Ravens, let's go,And put that ball across the line,So fly on with talons spread wide,Go in and strike with Ravens pride,FIGHT!

The interviews, and the game action audio/video clips of the players and coaches, etc.  really add a lot.It is a high quality review of the season, postseason, and finale that is well worth the price.
