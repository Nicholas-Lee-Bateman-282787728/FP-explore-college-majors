We play this for our grand daughter every night and she gets snuggly and ready to sleeping because the characters are all in their pjs and are getting ready for sleeping!  They have songs about brushing your teeth, ""sticking to the plan"" - following directions, listening to parents - don't eat all your candy at once, and many more excellent lessons for your child.DANGER!!!!

1537940,AOURF2C6EWZNS,B007TKRYO4,Jennifer,"[0, 0]","I found the Pajanimals on Sprout one night and my son loved them from the very first time we watched. When every they would flash them on the screen he would get excited but they only played them at 8pm to get ready for bedtime. The Pajanimals play a bit and then get ready for bed. But every night one of them always have a little issue that they need to work out before they can fall asleep though. They deal with the problem in a simple way that is easy for kids to understand. They also sing two cute songs, which are very catchy I too find myself humming them from time to time. My son just started brushing his teeth and we sing the Brusha, Brusha, Brusha song every night. The episodes are about 15 each so they are easy to watch and wind with before bedtime. I love having the Pajanimals on DVD because now we don't have to wait till 8pm to watch them. Which is great if we aren't home or he starts to get tired a little sooner in the evening, they are even great to have for nap time. My son know that when they come on it's time to relax and lay down. We have the two movies they have out right now and the only bad thing is I wish there were more. They are a must in my opinion for anyone who has little kids.",5,Everyone Needs Pajanimals,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1220,"['found', 'Pajanimals', 'Sprout', 'one', 'night', 'son', 'loved', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'When', 'would', 'flash', 'screen', 'would', 'get', 'excited', 'only', 'played', '8pm', 'get', 'ready', 'bedtime', 'Pajanimals', 'play', 'bit', 'then', 'get', 'ready', 'bed', 'night', 'one', 'always', 'have', 'little', 'issue', 'need', 'work', 'out', 'can', 'fall', 'asleep', 'deal', 'problem', 'simple', 'way', 'easy', 'kids', 'understand', 'also', 'sing', 'two', 'cute', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'catchy', 'too', 'find', 'humming', 'time', 'time', 'My', 'son', 'just', 'started', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'sing', 'Brusha', 'Brusha', 'Brusha', 'song', 'night', 'episodes', 'are', '15', 'are', 'easy', 'watch', 'wind', 'bedtime', 'love', 'having', 'Pajanimals', 'DVD', 'because', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'till', '8pm', 'watch', 'Which', 'great', 'are', ""n't"", 'home', 'get', 'tired', 'little', 'sooner', 'evening', 'are', 'even', 'great', 'have', 'nap', 'time', 'son', 'know', 'when', 'come', 'time', 'relax', 'lay', 'down', 'have', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'are', 'must', 'opinion', 'anyone', 'who', 'little', 'kids']",N/A

After much tossing and turning his animal friends help him go to bed with a little adventure to the land of hush where he learns another way to make it through the night.Home Sweet Home shows the animals heading on a plane ride and deciding what to take with them but better than that is the little Brusha, Brusha, Brusha song about brushing their teeth!

I was singing it this morning.Sweet Pea Sue isn't sure she wants to leave her house because she will miss it that is until the animals head out and visit the moon where she realizes that she can take something with her to remember home.In A Colorful Problem two of the animals have to learn how to share their favorite color crayon. Cowbella and Appolo can't sleep while they discuss why they deserve the crayon and why sharing is not an option until they visit bear who shows them why sharing is important.Puppy Love has the animals puppy sitting for their grandparents and the responsibility that comes with it.
