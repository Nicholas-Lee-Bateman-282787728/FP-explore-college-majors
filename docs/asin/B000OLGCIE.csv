The kids enjoy them, but as far as parent enjoyment goes this is the most painful of the three to sit through.  If you haven't seen the first and second, don't bother with this title.  If you only had a passing interest in the first or second movie and you don't have children that are clamoring to see this, don't bother with this movie.If you are a completionist, as I seem to be, and you already own the first two and need the third... or you have children that have already seen and love it but you don't own it.  Go ahead and buy it.  Your children at least, will probably be entertained.  I can't however guarantee your continued sanity if your children, like mine, like to watch their favorite movie of the week over and over and over and over and over again.Personally, I hate movie reviews that give you a full rundown of the movie... there are actual sites dedicated to that.  I prefer to focus on the more important aspects (or so I think) of &#34;will I find enjoyment in this film on repeated viewings&#34; or better yet &#34;will this movie for my children make me wish I could throw myself into traffic with repeated viewing&#34;.  This movie is pretty bad, but probably doesn't inspire serious suicidal thoughts unless you loop it back to back.Of course, not wanting to disappoint the elevator pitch for this movie is: Jack Frost is feeling neglected in his role among the mythical figures and wants his own holiday.  Santa is feeling a little overwhelmed with a very pregnant Mrs. Clause, the in-laws coming to the north pole so it's decided that Jack Frost (Martin Short) will help him out.  This is when we're introduced to the &#34;Escape Clause&#34;.  Frost spends all his time causing trouble and throwing things into chaos and tricks santa into giving up his powers at which point Jack Frost takes over.  The remainder of the movie Tim Allen spends trying to undo his mistake and get back into the suit and restore order to all things Christmas.Really, the first time or two you see this, it might be kind of cute.

1064663,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000OLGCIE,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","Film trilogies are funny things; most of the time, each additional chapter is made to be better than its predecessor, introducing new characters, events, and locations to keep the basic storyline fresh and entertaining. I'm not sure if I can say the same for the ""Santa Clause"" films; in watching the original film and its two sequels, I never felt that the new outdid the old. Rather, I felt as if the new represented a natural progression that didn't overshadow or upstage the old. I liked this because it resulted in films that were unique while remaining true to the underlying idea at the same time. It also resulted in undeniably charming films that reiterated well-established yet important family oriented messages. ""The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause"" is not the most original Christmas film ever made, but for the final chapter of a trilogy, it's delightful just the same.The people behind all three films have done a wonderful job of creating the world of Santa Claus, a world that's surprisingly regimented behind a facade of bright, colorful merrymaking. Some very stern rules have been introduced over the course of the trilogy, ones that were clearly outlined in the North Pole's contractual clauses. In 1994, we learned of the first clause, which stated that anyone who puts on Santa's red coat must assume the role. This is exactly what happened to Scott Calvin (Tim Allen); he accidentally kills Santa by startling him off of the roof, after which Calvin's son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), convinces him to wear the coat. He's then transformed from a workaholic father to Old Saint Nick. In 2002, we learned of the second clause, which stated that Santa had to get married if he wanted his magical abilities to remain. He ultimately falls in love with and weds Charlie's high school principal, Carol (Elizabeth Mitchell).In the tradition of the first two films, ""The Escape Clause"" introduces a new contractual clause that becomes the main focus of the plot. Apparently, there's a way for the current Santa to release himself from the responsibilities of delivering Christmas to the world: it's called the Escape Clause, which can only be carried out by holding a special snow globe and saying something to the effect of, ""I wish I had never become Santa."" Hoping to take control of the North Pole and Christmas, Jack Frost (Martin Short)--the mythological bringer of winter--tricks Calvin into doing this. Here's a character that's both literally and figuratively cold-hearted. He's tired of being an unrecognized holiday figure; he wants the kind of admiration and respect that Santa gets. He's especially attracted to the idea of being commercially immortalized with TV specials, stamps, soda bottles, and postcards.So he devises a plan, one that involves subtle manipulation and carefully orchestrated actions. He wanders around the main factory, casually destroying vital pieces of equipment. It's all an attempt to make Calvin look bad, not just in the eyes of his wife (who's about ready to give birth to their first child), but in the eyes of his family, as well, all of who are visiting. It doesn't help that the new head elf, Curtis (Spencer Breslin), is putting extra strain on Calvin, in turn making quality time with his wife harder to find. Adding insult to injury, Calvin took great pains to bring Carol's parents--Sylvia (Ann-Margret) and Bud Newman (Alan Arkin)--up to the North Pole (unconvincingly disguised as Canada for the occasion). Every foul up puts a wedge between the family members, and it's enough to make Calvin reconsider the life he's chosen for himself and his wife.What he doesn't realize is that this is exactly what Frost was hoping would happen. And by the time Calvin utters his wish, it's too late; the Escape Clause has taken effect. Both he and Frost are sent back to 1994, specifically to the moment when the previous Santa falls off of Calvin's roof. Frost quickly dons the red coat, and a change in the timeline is set into motion. Returning to 2006, Calvin quickly realizes that he's remained the emotionally distant workaholic he started out as; his relationship with Laura (Wendy Crewson) is worse than ever, and when it comes to his son, it's most likely beyond repair. Neil (Judge Reinhold) is resentful for having to pick up the pieces and for his eventual divorce with Laura. Carol is completely out of the picture, having supposedly moved away to ""terrify a new group of kids.""But something even worse has happened to the North Pole; Frost has turned it into a completely hollow, commercially dependent vacation resort for the public, complete with live stage shows, unnecessary merchandising, and an overcrowded reindeer petting zoo (the briefest shot of those loveable animatronic figures in agony is surprisingly depressing). The elves are reduced to walking around and waving to the guests like cartoon characters in a theme park. Parents and children aren't enjoying themselves so much as they're fighting, each demanding to be given yet another North Pole doodad. This understandably doesn't sit well with Calvin, and he's determined to make things right again. The question is whether or not he'll succeed.Then again, that may not be the question; remember that this is a kid's film, and kids films are notoriously formulaic. I think the real question is whether or not Calvin will succeed in under one hundred minutes; maybe he'll be sidetracked by something along the way. But in the end, it really doesn't matter. The film's heart is in the right place (as it was in the previous two films), and for me, that made the experience worthwhile. There's quite a bit to love about such Christmas films, especially when it comes to wacky, imaginative settings. ""The Escape Clause"" is certainly no exception; the North Pole is filled to the brim with pure creativity, from the whimsical sets to the bold costumes to the one-of-a-kind characters, all of which have returned (with the notable and disappointing exception of Bernard, played by David Krumholtz).Of all the characters, I was particularly fond of Lucy Miller (Liliana Mumy), introduced in the second film as Neil and Laura's daughter. For this film, she's given special significance, and it allows her to play a more important role in the story. On top of that, she's so sweet and innocent that you just can't watch her without melting. Maybe the filmmakers expanded her character because she's older and more mature; I obviously don't know for sure. What I do know is that she suited such a classic story perfectly, as did everyone else in this film.

It is like the actors are trying too hard to be funny.  Mrs. Claus, the very serious school principle in Santa Claus 2, is way to silly making her unbelievable.

If you have seen the other two, it is worth seeing.I am an avid fan of Tim Allen and collector of Christmas DVDs.  This will definitely be added to my collection as I am always looking for good Christmas movies for the entire family.  The humor in this movie definitely not as present as the previous two.  I was disappointed that the reindeers were not featured more as in the second one.  Martin Short as Jack Frost was something that I was not too sure of, but he manages to pull it off.There is more focus on Lucy (Neil and Laura's daughter) as well as the magical characters (Mother Nature, Easter Bunny, etc.).  If you enjoy movies involving the paradox of time travel, there is a small bit of it but that part feels a bit rushed.With other Christmas movies such as The Nativity Story coming out later this Christmas season, I think that they timed the release of this movie okay.

1064682,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B000OLGCIE,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[2, 2]","There have been several holiday movies in recent years that attempt to straddle the line between family-friendly and straight comedy. Movies like Elf, entertaining as they are, are so much a product of current comedy styles that one wonders how they will endure alongside true Christmas cinema classics. Only time will tell, and maybe it doesn't matter as long as we're entertained.Of the three Santa Clause Movies, The Santa Clause 3 is a curious work because while it may leave fans of the first two films feeling a little short, it actually is the least dated and most Disneyesque of the three.Most of this is due to the fact that the film takes place primarily at the North Pole rather than the ordinary world. So there is less emphasis on Santa/Scott's (Tim Allen) personal issues and more on toyshop fancy. Plus, the film is fueled by an electric performance by Martin Short as the crafty but beguiling Jack Frost. It's a bean feast for Short fans and to Allen's credit, Short is free to take center stage most of the time.It's sure nice to see Ann-Margret, any old time. And she has some of the best lines, delivering veiled comments of parental neglect sure to resound in most extended families. There's also a nice little moment between her and Short that was apparently ad-libbed and nicely genuine.The DVD has a bagful of special features including a highly informative audio commentary by Director Michael Lembeck (remember Kaptain Kool from ""The Krofft Supershow?""), bloopers and behind the scenes stuff.This film did not ignite the box office on its release last year, but it's highly re-watchable and has a very good chance of being a perennial winner.",4,"Candy cane coated and very Christmassy... and Ann-Margrock too, Wilma!",1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,1667,"['have', 'been', 'several', 'holiday', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'attempt', 'straddle', 'line', 'family-friendly', 'straight', 'comedy', 'Movies', 'Elf', 'entertaining', 'are', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'product', 'current', 'comedy', 'styles', 'one', 'how', 'will', 'endure', 'alongside', 'true', 'Christmas', 'cinema', 'classics', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'matter', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'three', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Movies', 'Santa', 'Clause', '3', 'curious', 'work', 'may', 'leave', 'fans', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'feeling', 'little', 'short', 'actually', 'least', 'dated', 'most', 'Disneyesque', 'three.Most', 'due', 'fact', 'film', 'place', 'primarily', 'North', 'Pole', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'world', 'less', 'emphasis', 'Santa/Scott', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'personal', 'issues', 'more', 'toyshop', 'fancy', 'film', 'fueled', 'electric', 'performance', 'Martin', 'Short', 'crafty', 'beguiling', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'bean', 'feast', 'Short', 'fans', 'Allen', 'credit', 'Short', 'free', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'most', 'time.It', 'sure', 'nice', 'see', 'Ann-Margret', 'old', 'time', 'best', 'lines', 'delivering', 'veiled', 'comments', 'parental', 'neglect', 'sure', 'resound', 'most', 'extended', 'families', 'also', 'nice', 'little', 'moment', 'Short', 'was', 'apparently', 'ad-libbed', 'nicely', 'genuine.The', 'DVD', 'bagful', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'highly', 'informative', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Lembeck', 'remember', 'Kaptain', 'Kool', 'Krofft', 'Supershow', 'bloopers', 'scenes', 'stuff.This', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'ignite', 'box', 'office', 'release', 'last', 'year', 'highly', 're-watchable', 'very', 'good', 'chance', 'being', 'perennial', 'winner']",N/A

We would of liked them to have kept Bernard in this movie but have him act as he did in the 1st movie not the goofy way he acted in the 2nd one. We'd like to see Curtis acting as he did in the second movie, he was credible and fun and helped Santa instead of the way they changed his character in this one.We also liked the elf girls Judy in the 1st movie and Abby in the 2nd, in this one they show an elf girl dressed similiarly but she is not in the spotlight at all,not shown up close, no noticible speaking part, we feel the girls in each of the first two movies added to the film, and we really missed a similiar girl elf character in this movie.We did not like that one of the elf girls kicks Santa, we like Santa portrayed as being respected. Same with the reindeer, they acted goofy and were gasing all the time it was annoying and they didn't show a respect to Santa like we'd expect. Afterall Santa is the ""MAN""!It would of been neat if they kept the same set inside the toy factory too. They made the Easter Bunny act differently too...once again goofy!

I think it's better than the 2nd one as well. It also has a better story. Martin Short adds some needed freshness to the trilogy as the villianess Jack Frost who's jealous that Santa gets all the spotlight. So he plots to get Santa to wish he was never Santa on a magic snow globe so he could take over as Santa. He causes mischief to stress Santa out to make him regret being Santa. On top of that Santa disguises the North Pole as...Canada  for his in-laws (Alan Arkin and Anne Margarett) who have no clue he's Santa. I guess they think it's normal for their middle aged son-in-law to be fat with grey hair and a grey beard with a habit of wearing Christmas sweaters.Newsday gave it ** and said Martin Short was the only thing good about it.

They want reliable, reassuring entertainment, preferably with an upbeat, if unrealistic, ending. Back in November 2006, I suppose my parents and I had that hankering for that ""cinematic comfort food"" when we saw Tim Allen play the jovial, corpulent one for the third time. Overall, the movie fed us well, even if the food consisted of eye candy, ear candy, and tear candy.The plot basically consists of Santa Allen juggling his expecting wife, her bemused parents (Ann-Margaret and Alan Arkin) who complain of insufficient family time, and the machinations of the devious original Cold Miser himself, Jack Frost (Martin Short). It's no surprise that Santa successfully keeps all the balls in the air, although it's also no surprise that he also almost loses his world because of Jack.""Santa Clause 3"" is cute, sweet, innocuous fun, with occasional flashes of jaded Christmas cynicism from Short and, to a lesser extent, from Arkin. For example, Short's conversion of the North Pole to a Vegas-like production had bite, even if it was a bit hackneyed. When Arkin pouts after Santa's (Scott Calvin's) daughter by his ex-wife and Judge Reinhold's psychiatrist character (whew!) defeat Jack with a literally warm hug, the audience roared. Another scene, where Scott is tricked into giving up Santahood by Frost and becomes corporate Scott Calvin again reminded me a little of Bill Murray's character in ""Scrooged"". However, the movie is ultimately geared to the little ones, on whom it seemed to work, because the theater I saw it in was full of very young children, and they kept quiet and still!The movie gets the majority of its laughs from the emoting Short, the skeptical Arkin, and the sight gags like the yawning ""Santa Fireplace"". Allen wisely defers to them in the humor department, although he cuts loose in the hilarious outtakes at the movie's end. (""Mother Nature, can you thaw him out? Uhh, oops!"")If you are willing to leave your logical cynicism at the front door and bathe in the usual Christmas treacle, rent this movie.

I was rolling my eyes and gagging throughout this movie.The acting is appalling from everyone involved to Tim Allens extremely pissed off look throughout the film his horrid acting and way beyond what you would call OVERACTING.To Short going way overboard being one of the most annoying characters ive ever witnessed in a CHRISTMAS movie especially.He and Allens slapstick if you can even call it that as well as their acting and everyones involved was like nails on a chalkboard.The little girl actress who played Allens characters niece was beyond horrible I just wanted her to shutup the entire time she could not act her way out of a paperbag period.The sickeningly sweet crap in this movie also went wayyy too far it was ridiculous how they threw so much sweet care bear crap at the screen... throughout the movie. Even more pathetic is they attempted to preach to people with this entry and put a MORAL at the end of the movie.My father back when he was alive agreed with me that it was a horrible movie.I expected this one to be just as funny cute charming and sweet as the other movies.Instead what I was left with was a bag of coal .The Its A Wonderful Life twist was also extremely stupid horribly acted and literally you could tell that ALL the performances in this movie were PHONED IN.No one was acting in this movie it was obvious they were just phoning it in throughout the whole movie they acted like they didnt even care especially Allen who you could tell did not even want to be there for this entry.The song and dance number by Short was unbelievably corny the ex wifes parents were also horribly acted by 2 people who are normally very good actors: Ann Margaret and Alan Arkin.Oh and if this movie has not slapped you in the face with enough cutesy saccarine sweet crap brace yourselves for the stupidest and most PREDICTABLE ending ever.No wonder a 4th Santa Clause movie was never made this entry no doubt at all sunk the franchise permanently.,1,The title explains what many people wanted: to ESCAPE this film period.,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,2143,"['loved', 'first', '2', 'Santa', 'Clauses', 'thought', 'were', 'cute', 'charming', 'sweet', 'great', 'holiday', 'movies', 'classics', 'even.I', 'watched', 'third', 'one', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'gagging', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'appalling', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Tim', 'Allens', 'extremely', 'pissed', 'off', 'look', 'film', 'horrid', 'acting', 'way', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'OVERACTING.To', 'Short', 'going', 'way', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'characters', 'ive', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'CHRISTMAS', 'movie', 'especially.He', 'Allens', 'slapstick', 'can', 'even', 'call', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'everyones', 'involved', 'was', 'nails', 'chalkboard.The', 'little', 'girl', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Allens', 'characters', 'niece', 'was', 'horrible', 'just', 'wanted', 'shutup', 'entire', 'time', 'could', 'not', 'act', 'way', 'paperbag', 'period.The', 'sickeningly', 'sweet', 'crap', 'movie', 'also', 'went', 'wayyy', 'too', 'far', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'how', 'threw', 'so', 'much', 'sweet', 'care', 'bear', 'crap', 'screen', 'movie', 'Even', 'more', 'pathetic', 'attempted', 'preach', 'people', 'entry', 'put', 'MORAL', 'end', 'movie.My', 'father', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'agreed', 'was', 'horrible', 'movie.I', 'expected', 'one', 'be', 'just', 'funny', 'cute', 'charming', 'sweet', 'other', 'movies.Instead', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'was', 'bag', 'coal', '.The', 'A', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'twist', 'was', 'also', 'extremely', 'stupid', 'horribly', 'acted', 'literally', 'could', 'tell', 'performances', 'movie', 'were', 'PHONED', 'IN.No', 'one', 'was', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'obvious', 'were', 'just', 'phoning', 'whole', 'movie', 'acted', 'didnt', 'even', 'care', 'especially', 'Allen', 'who', 'could', 'tell', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'entry.The', 'song', 'dance', 'number', 'Short', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'ex', 'wifes', 'parents', 'were', 'also', 'horribly', 'acted', '2', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'normally', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Ann', 'Margaret', 'Alan', 'Arkin.Oh', 'movie', 'not', 'slapped', 'face', 'enough', 'cutesy', 'saccarine', 'sweet', 'crap', 'brace', 'yourselves', 'stupidest', 'most', 'PREDICTABLE', 'ending', 'ever.No', 'wonder', '4th', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'entry', 'doubt', 'sunk', 'franchise', 'permanently']",N/A

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","Thanksgiving is the time to start watching holiday movies, beginning with ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" which begins with the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. It is also the time of year for last year's Christmas movies to come out so that we can buy for this Christmas. ""The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause"" and ""Deck the Halls"" both came out this week, and having watched the former today while doing my Black Friday shopping on line I have to say that I am glad they never made ""Miracle on 35th Street,"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life, Part II: Mr. Potter's Revenge."" Tim Allen makes a great Santa Claus, but by the third time around the charm of the original is long gone. How many times does Scott Clavin have to embrace being Santa Claus? Apparently three times, but let me get back to you four or five years down the road to see if that number has increased.In this 2006 Christmas film it is the week before Christmas and things are once again getting frantic at the North Pole. Santa's wife, Carol (Elizabeth Mitchell), is great with child and missing her home and family. So Scott decides if he cannot let his wife go to her parents, he will bring her parents, Sylvia (Ann-Margaret) and Bud (Alan Arkin), to the North Pole, which they will pretend is is Canada (the secret of Santa, a.k.a. ""S.O.S.,"" must be preserved). But also along for the ride are Scott's ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson), her husband, Neil (Judge Reinhold), and their daughter, Lucy (Liliana Mumy), and pretty much everything that I really liked about this movie ended up having to do with Lucy.However, the key dynamic of the movie is between Santa and Jack Frost who is played by Martin Short as a creature who is a bit more menacing than he is funny, but not that funny. Jack thinks he deserves a more important role in the hierarchy of legendary figures, and when Mother Nature, the Tooth Fairy, and the rest of the gang tell him no, he decides to find a way to supplant Scott as Santa. The escape clause mentioned in the title has to do with Scott's special Santa snow globe and saying the magic words (""I wish that I had never become Santa Claus at all""). You know that Jack is going to succeed and that Scott is going to get his Santa suit back. You might be expecting the whole George Bailey gets to see the brave new world created by his wish, but we really get just a glimpse of that, and Scott ends up covering some of the same ground as ""Back to the Future, Part II."" Even then, they are just going through the motions, inserting scenes from the original without coming up with anything remotely inspired in any of these sequences.The character of Lucy is important because the appeal of these movies is to small kids (or the small kid inside of most of us), and Eric Lloyd, who played Scott's son Charlie in the previous two films, is too old to play the role. Scott and Carol's baby has not been born yet, so screenwriters Ed Decter and John J. Strauss take Lucy from the second film and put her in the pivotal role. Her half-brother has been to the North Pole and Lucy has always wanted to go and she loves snow globes more than any other material item in Santa's Workshop. She has a special relationship with ""Uncle"" Scott, and that comes into play during the big finish. Scott has such problematic relationships with his pregnant wife, disapproving father-in-law, head-elf (Spencer Breslin, whose sister Abigail appears in the prologue and conclusion as one of the elves), and would-be-nemesis Jack Frost, that he has to resort to high-paced shtick with them, but with Lucy we really get to see Scott as Santa Claus. The problem is that there are very few of those scenes. You can debate whether ""The Santa Clause 3"" is an improvement on ""The Santa Clause 2,"" but there is no doubt that the original is far and away the best of the lot and its charm is only being diluted by these sequels, regardless of the money they might be bringing in.",3,For the third time Tim Allen's Scott Calvin embraces being Santa Claus,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,3927,"['Thanksgiving', 'time', 'start', 'watching', 'holiday', 'movies', 'beginning', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'Macy', 'Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'parade', 'also', 'time', 'year', 'last', 'year', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'so', 'can', 'buy', 'Christmas', 'Santa', 'Clause', '3', 'Escape', 'Clause', 'Deck', 'Halls', 'came', 'out', 'week', 'having', 'watched', 'former', 'today', 'doing', 'Black', 'Friday', 'shopping', 'line', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'glad', 'never', 'made', 'Miracle', '35th', 'Street', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Part', 'II', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'Revenge', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'great', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'third', 'time', 'charm', 'original', 'long', 'gone', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'Scott', 'Clavin', 'have', 'embrace', 'being', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Apparently', 'three', 'times', 'let', 'get', 'back', 'four', 'five', 'years', 'road', 'see', 'number', 'increased.In', '2006', 'Christmas', 'film', 'week', 'Christmas', 'things', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'getting', 'frantic', 'North', 'Pole', 'Santa', 'wife', 'Carol', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'great', 'child', 'missing', 'home', 'family', 'So', 'Scott', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'wife', 'go', 'parents', 'will', 'bring', 'parents', 'Sylvia', 'Ann-Margaret', 'Bud', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'North', 'Pole', 'will', 'pretend', 'Canada', 'secret', 'Santa', 'a.k.a', 'S.O.S.', 'must', 'be', 'preserved', 'also', 'along', 'ride', 'are', 'Scott', 'ex-wife', 'Laura', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'husband', 'Neil', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Liliana', 'Mumy', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'do', 'Lucy.However', 'key', 'dynamic', 'movie', 'Santa', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'who', 'played', 'Martin', 'Short', 'creature', 'who', 'bit', 'more', 'menacing', 'funny', 'not', 'funny', 'Jack', 'more', 'important', 'role', 'hierarchy', 'legendary', 'figures', 'when', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'rest', 'gang', 'tell', 'find', 'way', 'supplant', 'Scott', 'Santa', 'escape', 'clause', 'mentioned', 'title', 'do', 'Scott', 'special', 'Santa', 'snow', 'globe', 'saying', 'magic', 'words', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'become', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'know', 'Jack', 'going', 'succeed', 'Scott', 'going', 'get', 'Santa', 'suit', 'back', 'might', 'be', 'expecting', 'whole', 'George', 'Bailey', 'see', 'brave', 'new', 'world', 'created', 'wish', 'really', 'get', 'just', 'glimpse', 'Scott', 'up', 'covering', 'same', 'ground', 'Back', 'Future', 'Part', 'II', 'Even', 'then', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'inserting', 'scenes', 'original', 'coming', 'up', 'anything', 'remotely', 'inspired', 'sequences.The', 'character', 'Lucy', 'important', 'appeal', 'movies', 'small', 'kids', 'small', 'kid', 'most', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'played', 'Scott', 'son', 'Charlie', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'role', 'Scott', 'Carol', 'baby', 'not', 'been', 'born', 'yet', 'screenwriters', 'Ed', 'Decter', 'John', 'J.', 'Strauss', 'take', 'Lucy', 'second', 'film', 'put', 'pivotal', 'role', 'half-brother', 'been', 'North', 'Pole', 'Lucy', 'always', 'wanted', 'go', 'snow', 'globes', 'more', 'other', 'material', 'item', 'Santa', 'Workshop', 'special', 'relationship', 'Uncle', 'Scott', 'play', 'big', 'finish', 'Scott', 'such', 'problematic', 'relationships', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'disapproving', 'father-in-law', 'head-elf', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', 'sister', 'Abigail', 'prologue', 'conclusion', 'one', 'elves', 'would-be-nemesis', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'resort', 'high-paced', 'shtick', 'Lucy', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'Scott', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'problem', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'scenes', 'can', 'debate', 'Santa', 'Clause', '3', 'improvement', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'doubt', 'original', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'lot', 'charm', 'only', 'being', 'diluted', 'sequels', 'regardless', 'money', 'might', 'be', 'bringing']",N/A

The second movie was enjoyable, but as usual did not come anywhere near the original, but it was a valiant effort, and an enjoyable Christmas film.  So, if it goes that the quality goes down with each film, does that make ""The Escape Clause"" a horrible film?The plot is simple enough, Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) is starting to get a little fed up of being Santa Clause because of the added stress of his wife and her family (They do not know Scott is Santa Clause).  He learns that there is another ""clause"" that he did not know about; he can go back in time to the day that he became Santa Clause, and stop himself from putting on the suite, and of course not become Santa Clause.  Of course there is a villain ""Jack Frost"" played by Martin Short who is has his own ideas of what Christmas should be, and tries to use this ""clause"" to his advantage.The movie overall was enjoyable, and had a very festive atmosphere.  If you are expecting a great movie, go somewhere else.  ""Santa Clause 3"" is purely about fun, but of course it has a message in too for good measure.  The good thing about this movie is that we get to see more of the North Pole, and see what it may have been like if Scott wasn't Santa Clause.

This one was just as good as we hoped and we really enjoyed it. My son was 12 when the first one came out and even at 23 he enjoyed the scenes with the elves and Tim Allen. We both enjoyed the message of the storyline, we both had our favorite parts. But we also both missed not having Bernard in it.  Even a mention of him working somewhere else would have helped at least, but not a word.  We understand not all actors are available when a movie is being made. Still we like SC3 managed to bring in the cast from the first two with a wonderful feeling of family.  I was mad someone reviewed this saying Charlie lived at North Pole with his dad, untrue and I was also mad that the new head elf was not smart enough to see what Jack Frost was up to, or that no one figured out what was causing the chaos when for 12 years things always seemed to run pretty smooth.

Not only does Scott Calvin, aka Santa (Tim Allen), have to get ready to deliver toys all over the world, but his wife Carol (Elizabeth Mitchell) is getting ready for a delivery of her own.She is also missing her family.  So Scott decides to invite her parents (Alan Arkin and Ann-Margret) to visit for the holiday.  Scott's ex-wife and her family also manage to get an invitation as well.  But the visiting family only adds to the stress load.But that's the last of Scott's problems.  Jack Frost (Martin Short) feels left out.  He wants his own big holiday, not just to be the front-runner of the big red guy.  When he is almost tossed from the Society of Enchanted Beings, he talks Scott into letting him help get everything ready for the big day.Unfortunately, Jack's real mission is to sabotage Santa's job and learn the secret of the escape clause.  If he can do that, he'll take over the role of Santa and leave Scott with nothing.  Will he succeed?I love the first film in the series and enjoy the second.  This one is just as enjoyable.  Yes, the story is predictable, but it is entertaining and heartwarming.  I felt like cheering at the end.And the actors continue to do a great job.  The entire cast from the first two movies is back, with one noticeable exception.  David Krumholtz wasn't able to return as Bernard.  While his character was missed, it didn't hurt the film too much.There is lots to laugh at in this movie.  There are lots of great puns on the word elf and some great visual gags as well.  Unfortunately, the Canadian jokes (they pretend to be Canadian for the in-laws), do where thin fast, eh?

The first two films did a brilliant job of creating a need for the story and then wonderfully executing the stories. But this one has no purpose at all. Aside from leaving out Bernard, they did a good job of re-uniting the cast. (I guess they enticed everyone to return with the jingle-jangle of coins they thought they could make with this movie.)Sadly for the investors on this film, the movie bombed. Yes, it made $84 million but with a budget far in excess of this, the movie was a financial disaster. Whereas the second film was a financial success and loved by audiences, SC3 received a 3.6 rating on IMDB (SC2 got a 5.6) and SC3 lost money.What can you expect from a movie that went no where, didn't have the fun of the second film, and lacked any personality at all?

This third movie was a bit of a disappointment.  The change in tone set in the 2nd film is continued here, and the whole production has a straight-to-video feel about it despite the large budget - and no Bernard.  Instead, Curtis the Elf - once again played by Spencer Breslin (who in my book should go down in history as one of the top ten most annoying child actors ever) gets an expanded role.  In the second movie he was pretty harmless, but this time he's older and while he's grown considerably in stature, his acting chops have not.  I don't know about anyone else, but I don't really see how this kid was ever allowed in front of the camera.

Kids in the theatre seemed to be bored too and the sad thing is that there wasn't anything real funny in this flick ... the lines were rehashed and there wasn't a real surprise.Most smaller children will not understand what in the world is going on as the dialogue is very fast and sloppy, especially in the beginning, and the vocabulary is just way above the understanding of little ones.Also I didn't like that Santa has an Ex-wife and in a sense this movie takes away from the magic of Santa Claus. The moral of the story that Santa as a Dad was and is working too much and that he has no time for his family seems forced. The acting is okay, although it's nothing to get excited about.The stage looks like a set up in a small-town or High School theater. This movie doesn't get you into the Christmas spirit, and I thought watching it was a waste of time. It's just sad that here's Disney Studios with all it's financing, the top equipment and a pool of top actors and so forth, and then they can't produce something stunning, but instead they opt for a so-so storyline with rather flat results.BTW the Easter Bunny appears in this movie too and he looks scary.

Martin Short's character, Jack Frost, is a fun villian providing lots of predictable one liners during his intentions to become the new SC. The other holiday characters--Cupid, Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, Father Time, Sandman, Mother Nature--are cute but don't get much screen time.Part 3 strays from the first two a bit with all of its magic and whimsy, taking place mostly at the North Pole.  That was okay, but the real life interaction and conflicts of Tim Allen as Scott Calvin becoming Santa in the first movie is the best yet and hard to compete with.The plot is clouded a bit with Mrs. Santa's pregnancy, and the confusion of Scott Calvin returning to the real world after Jack Frost has tricked him out of being Santa.

The first movie, The Santa Clause, was marvelous. The Santa Clause 2 - The Mrs. Clause was good, but took the cuteness to far at the expense of substance and, hence, wasn't as funny. It seems to me that this effort falls between the two. Martin Short's performance is both extremely hilarious and very scary. He's wonderful! Although you go into the movie feeling confident of a happy ending (it's a Santa Clause movie after all), there is true jeopardy along the way.Ann  Margaret and Alan Arkin bring their many combined years of experience to the Santa-in-laws with great humor and biting wit. The regular cast turns in its usual stalwart support. Judge Reinhold has raised the irritating, well meaning, psycho-babbling Neil to new heights. In the present or the past, you can't help but like him, even as you reach out to strangle him with your bare hands!

The film had been expected to do decently, but brought in a whopping $145 million (that was a huge figure at the time for a holiday movie), gave Tim Allen the successful film he needed to start bridging the gap between tv and film, and gave Disney a film successful enough to at least pursue a sequel.  It was eight years before the sequel finally came.  That film was fairly successful and the filmmakers didn't want to wait another eight years and cut the time in half before coming out with THE SANTA CLAUSE 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE.This third and in all probability final installment of THE SANTA CLAUSE begins at an undefined time about a year after the THE SANTA CLAUSE 2.  It's the Christmas season and the North Pole is as busy as ever.  Things are a bit more chaotic for Santa (Tim Allen), though. To begin with there have been several production breakdowns which have put things behind schedule.  Mrs. Clause (Elizabeth Mitchell) is pregnant and is due to deliver at any time.  She's really wanting some family around, so Santa agrees to fly her parents in for a visit to see the baby and Santa Scott's ex-wife, husband, and his niece come along for the ride.  They know about Scott being Santa, but since Mrs. Clause's parents don't, the entire North Pole is turned into a miniature Canadian village.If that isn't enough, the council of magical beings (or something to that effect) has called an emergency meeting.  It seems that Jack Frost (Martin Short) is trying to take over Christmas.  He's always been jealous of Santa and his antics have increased since Scott Calvin became the new Santa.  The Council is on the verge of suspending Jack and revoking his magical abilities, but he convinces them to let him work for Santa instead as a way of learning how to be a good magical being.  The Council agrees, but Jack's playing a game.  He wants to Christmas for himself.  He finds a way when he learns about another clause in the Santa contract:  the escape clause and goes about setting up a complicated plot to trick Santa into using the escape clause.The filmmakers for THE SANTA CLAUSE 3 have done a great job of keeping the look and feel of the first two films in this installment.  Of course, the director, Michael Lembeck, and one of the writers, Ed Decter, performed those same duties on THE SANTA CLAUSE 2.  All of the cast members from THE SANTA CLAUSE 2, except David Krumholtz (who played the elf Bernard in the first two films), has returned for this movie which really helps the continuity.  It's so frustrating when sequels are made and only one or two of the original actors return.  When the entire cast comes back it makes for a better overall experience.Tim Allen and Martin Short are a joy to watch on the screen.  Allen has some interesting moments reminiscent of scenes from the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy when he sees himself from twelve years before.  Meanwhile, Short shines on screen as the jealous villain Jack Frost, the inventor of chill with a frozen heart.  Some of the scenes I found most funny involving Short where when he was pretending to be a mascot for the ""Canadian"" parade the village was going to have while Mrs. Clause's parents were in the north pole.  It's funny because Short is from Canada and its hilarious seeing him using stereotypical Canadian phrases.THE SANTA CLAUSE 3 is an excellent family Christmas movie that closes out the series well.  My only complaint is that the film didn't spend enough time showing what the world was like if Jack Frost had become Santa instead of Scott.  The movie builds up to that point and it feels much too short.  However, I still enjoyed the movie and recommend it, especially as a Christmas movie for families with children.",4,Have a Merry Frostmas.,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,3815,"['1994', 'THE', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', 'proved', 'be', 'big', 'surprise', 'winner', 'movie', 'Christmas', 'season', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'expected', 'do', 'decently', 'brought', 'whopping', '145', 'million', 'was', 'huge', 'figure', 'time', 'holiday', 'movie', 'gave', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'successful', 'film', 'needed', 'start', 'bridging', 'gap', 'tv', 'film', 'gave', 'Disney', 'film', 'successful', 'enough', 'least', 'pursue', 'sequel', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'sequel', 'finally', 'came', 'film', 'was', 'fairly', 'successful', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'wait', 'eight', 'years', 'cut', 'time', 'half', 'coming', 'out', 'THE', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', '3', 'ESCAPE', 'CLAUSE.This', 'third', 'probability', 'final', 'installment', 'THE', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', 'undefined', 'time', 'year', 'THE', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', '2', 'Christmas', 'season', 'North', 'Pole', 'as', 'busy', 'ever', 'Things', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'chaotic', 'Santa', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'though', 'begin', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'production', 'breakdowns', 'have', 'put', 'things', 'schedule', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'pregnant', 'due', 'deliver', 'time', 'really', 'wanting', 'family', 'around', 'Santa', 'fly', 'parents', 'visit', 'see', 'baby', 'Santa', 'Scott', 'ex-wife', 'husband', 'niece', 'come', 'along', 'ride', 'know', 'Scott', 'being', 'Santa', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'entire', 'North', 'Pole', 'turned', 'miniature', 'Canadian', 'village.If', ""n't"", 'enough', 'council', 'magical', 'beings', 'something', 'effect', 'called', 'emergency', 'meeting', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Martin', 'Short', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'Christmas', 'always', 'been', 'jealous', 'Santa', 'antics', 'have', 'increased', 'Scott', 'Calvin', 'became', 'new', 'Santa', 'Council', 'verge', 'suspending', 'Jack', 'revoking', 'magical', 'abilities', 'let', 'work', 'Santa', 'instead', 'way', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'good', 'magical', 'being', 'Council', 'Jack', 'playing', 'game', 'Christmas', 'way', 'when', 'clause', 'Santa', 'contract', 'escape', 'clause', 'about', 'setting', 'up', 'complicated', 'plot', 'trick', 'Santa', 'using', 'escape', 'clause.The', 'filmmakers', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', '3', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'look', 'feel', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'installment', 'course', 'director', 'Michael', 'Lembeck', 'one', 'writers', 'Ed', 'Decter', 'performed', 'same', 'duties', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', '2', 'cast', 'members', 'THE', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', '2', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'who', 'played', 'elf', 'Bernard', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'returned', 'movie', 'really', 'continuity', 'so', 'frustrating', 'when', 'sequels', 'are', 'made', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'original', 'actors', 'return', 'When', 'entire', 'cast', 'back', 'better', 'overall', 'experience.Tim', 'Allen', 'Martin', 'Short', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'screen', 'Allen', 'interesting', 'moments', 'reminiscent', 'scenes', 'BACK', 'TO', 'THE', 'FUTURE', 'trilogy', 'when', 'twelve', 'years', 'Meanwhile', 'Short', 'screen', 'jealous', 'villain', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'inventor', 'chill', 'frozen', 'heart', 'scenes', 'found', 'most', 'funny', 'involving', 'Short', 'where', 'when', 'was', 'pretending', 'be', 'mascot', 'Canadian', 'parade', 'village', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'Mrs', 'Clause', 'parents', 'were', 'north', 'pole', 'funny', 'Short', 'Canada', 'hilarious', 'seeing', 'using', 'stereotypical', 'Canadian', 'phrases.THE', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', '3', 'excellent', 'family', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'out', 'series', 'well', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'showing', 'what', 'world', 'was', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'had', 'become', 'Santa', 'instead', 'Scott', 'movie', 'up', 'point', 'much', 'too', 'short', 'However', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'recommend', 'especially', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'families', 'children']",N/A
1064743,A2J9QBVH149J29,B000OLGCIE,Wayne Minge,"[3, 3]","Walt Disney Home Entertainment released The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause on DVD on November 20th, 2007. This is the 3rd film in the popular Christmas film series, The Santa Clause. Tim Allen once again reprises his role as Scott Calvin/Santa Claus. This DVD features the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 widescreen and a reformatted full screen 1.33:1 presentation. For the special features on the disc, well there really isn't much offered here. Just a 4 minute 'so-called' Making Of, and a few other worthless features. Not even a fan of all 3 of The Santa Clause movies will enjoy this. Seems to me that it took Disney over a year to release this on DVD, maybe they could spend a little more time on the DVD release. Guess a year isn't enough for them. I bought it simply because I seen it like 3 times in the theaters and I liked it alot. Sometimes features really don't matter to me, it just seems a year was enough time to get some proper features on this release. If you have the previous films in this series, I would recommend buying this. Keep in mind as with The Santa Clause 2, you will need the others in the series for it to make sense to you.",5,The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,1174,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'released', 'Santa', 'Clause', '3', 'Escape', 'Clause', 'DVD', 'November', '20th', '2007', '3rd', 'film', 'popular', 'Christmas', 'film', 'series', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'once', 'again', 'role', 'Scott', 'Calvin/Santa', 'Claus', 'DVD', 'film', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'widescreen', 'reformatted', 'full', 'screen', '1.33:1', 'presentation', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'well', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'offered', 'here', 'Just', '4', 'minute', ""'so-called"", 'Making', 'few', 'other', 'worthless', 'features', 'Not', 'even', 'fan', '3', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'movies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'took', 'Disney', 'year', 'release', 'DVD', 'maybe', 'could', 'spend', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'DVD', 'release', 'Guess', 'year', ""n't"", 'enough', 'bought', 'simply', 'seen', '3', 'times', 'theaters', 'liked', 'alot', 'Sometimes', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'just', 'year', 'was', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'proper', 'features', 'release', 'have', 'previous', 'films', 'series', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'Keep', 'mind', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'will', 'need', 'others', 'series', 'make', 'sense']",N/A
