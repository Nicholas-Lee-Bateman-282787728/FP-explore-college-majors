First of all I thought it was a romantic comedy- that is how the commericals and trailers set it up as... but let me stop you there. It's not. Although not necessarily a traumatic or even drama filled ending... it wasn't exactly a hppy-ever-after wedding either.  I was overall disappointed- but it was beyond my genre expectation as I also enjoy a good drama or heart-wrenching ""real life"" movie as well (see Silver Lining Playbook).What I didn't like:very poor character development. all of a sudden there was this love-lost between the 2 leads. sorry. didn't feel it. very little chemistry between the two actors even though Biel and Gerard were AMAZINGLY talented... I didn't connect with them and I didn't connect with this mohter-father duo fighting to find their lost love...  We also never know what he did to ""mess up"" and we don't really know or understand that he just ""has bad timing"" outside of that they just simply state it several times. Ok. really? bad timing would have been if she was ALREADY married. she wasn't.secondary characters didn't add much to the plot. there were ALOT of big names in this film- Catherine Zeta Jones.. Dennis Quaid. I was sold. (think Valentine's Day) but they didn't really connect with one another and some of them were really forced into the story.bad romance/connections. so apparently he sleeps with several of the soccer moms- but it's implied, not really shown. but the whole time we are supposed to believe he is in love with his ex-wife/child's mother. really? because you just slept with Zeta-Jones- which was also very loveless by both characters.plot. he is an ex-soccer player at the ranking of David Beckam... but has NO money... and NO prospects of work. really? I guess I can buy it.. but it really wasn't set up very well to buy it. (ok... so he is running away from his landlord a couple times and then smooth talks him until he finally hands him a bunch of cash (where he accidently overpays) and now all is well... the landlord ends up being a peeing tom but then he ends up with one of the soccer moms? what? - I just didn't like it. I feel like they had all these great elements for a story and it just fell short all the way around the block.What I did like:that I rented this and didn't pay a fortune to see it in the theatre.main lead Gerard Butler.

1604579,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00A2H9UG6,Chris Kennison,"[21, 22]","""Playing for Keeps"" starring Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera, The Ugly Truth and many other so-so movies), is about a former soccer star named George that played alongside David Beckham in his hay-day and has fallen far from grace. He's a guy who's a natural at getting things and being given things, but horrible at making decisions, knowing when people are taking advantage of him and growing up. So, when he returns to the hometown of his former love, Stacie (Jessica Biel), to patch things up and reunite with his son, the typical romantic movie story begins to play out.That being said, this movie has been a subject of numerous poor reviews from national critics and I would have to say that for some reasons, criticism is justified, but the movie is nowhere near as bad as it is being portrayed. The script is strange. It portrays Butler's character realistically, but occasionally gets farcical at random times. He's a ladies man and always has been. Women flock to him, so when he accidentally ends up coaching his son's soccer team, he becomes the target of many players Mom's; single, disturbed, married, manipulative. Then of course there's the Indian neighbor who seems to have no life, but watching George hosting numerous women from the guesthouse that he is renting.George is a hard character to like. Although I found his character realistic in portrayal as someone who has numerous women who want him and everybody treating him like a celebrity. Quite simply, he takes it. Most would. Yet, as predictable as the script may be, I found the things that happened in the movie justified. George grows throughout the movie and he battles with his maturity. There are many valuable lessons that many will relate to in the film. For the most part, being a parent requires a lack of selfishness and that is George's biggest challenge.Look, I'm not going to call this movie great or anything like that, but romantic comedies are like horror movies these days, they're all the same. I found ""Playing for Keeps"" unique and I found the characterizations and characters realistic, with the exception of a few times when the movie tried to be silly.""Playing for Keeps"" is certainly a better alternative to the unrealistic portrayal's of men in Nicholas Sparks movies. In Sparks movies, ""Dear John"", ""The Lucky One"" and ""The Notebook"", the men are pristine, they have no depth, they are just perfect people who serve no purpose but to provide motivation for the women that pursue them. At least in ""Playing for Keeps"", the male character has tremendous flaws and we can all relate because we all do.",4,I THINK I LIKED THIS BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFERENT,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2606,"['Playing', 'Keeps', 'starring', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'many', 'other', 'so-so', 'movies', 'former', 'soccer', 'star', 'named', 'George', 'played', 'alongside', 'David', 'Beckham', 'hay-day', 'fallen', 'far', 'grace', 'guy', 'who', 'natural', 'getting', 'things', 'being', 'given', 'things', 'horrible', 'making', 'decisions', 'knowing', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'taking', 'advantage', 'growing', 'up', 'So', 'when', 'hometown', 'former', 'love', 'Stacie', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'reunite', 'son', 'typical', 'romantic', 'movie', 'story', 'play', 'out.That', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'been', 'subject', 'numerous', 'poor', 'reviews', 'national', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'reasons', 'criticism', 'justified', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'being', 'portrayed', 'script', 'strange', 'Butler', 'character', 'realistically', 'occasionally', 'farcical', 'random', 'times', 'ladies', 'man', 'always', 'been', 'Women', 'flock', 'so', 'when', 'accidentally', 'up', 'coaching', 'son', 'soccer', 'team', 'target', 'many', 'players', 'Mom', 'single', 'disturbed', 'married', 'manipulative', 'Then', 'course', 'Indian', 'neighbor', 'who', 'have', 'life', 'watching', 'George', 'hosting', 'numerous', 'women', 'guesthouse', 'renting.George', 'hard', 'character', 'like', 'found', 'character', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'someone', 'who', 'numerous', 'women', 'who', 'want', 'everybody', 'treating', 'celebrity', 'Quite', 'simply', 'Most', 'would', 'Yet', 'as', 'predictable', 'script', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'things', 'happened', 'movie', 'justified', 'George', 'movie', 'maturity', 'are', 'many', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'many', 'will', 'relate', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'being', 'parent', 'lack', 'selfishness', 'George', 'biggest', 'challenge.Look', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'call', 'movie', 'great', 'anything', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'horror', 'movies', 'days', ""'re"", 'same', 'found', 'Playing', 'Keeps', 'unique', 'found', 'characterizations', 'characters', 'realistic', 'exception', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'tried', 'be', 'silly', 'Playing', 'Keeps', 'certainly', 'better', 'alternative', 'unrealistic', 'portrayal', 'men', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'movies', 'Sparks', 'movies', 'Dear', 'John', 'Lucky', 'One', 'Notebook', 'men', 'are', 'pristine', 'have', 'depth', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'people', 'who', 'serve', 'purpose', 'provide', 'motivation', 'women', 'pursue', 'least', 'Playing', 'Keeps', 'male', 'character', 'tremendous', 'flaws', 'can', 'relate', 'do']",N/A

Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","From director Gabriele Muccino (""The Pursuit of Happyness"", ""Seven Pounds"", ""Remember Me, My Love"") and writer Robbie Fox (""In the Army Now"", ""So I Married an Axe Murder"") comes the romantic comedy with an all star cast.Starring in the film are Gerard Butler (""300&#8243;, ""RocknRolla"", ""The Phantom of the Opera""), Jessica Biel (""The Illusionist"", ""The A-Team"", ""Total Recall""), Dennis Quaid (""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""Vantage Point"", ""Frequency""), Uma Thurman (""Kill Bill: Vol. 1&#8243;, ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Gattaca"", ""Batman & Robin""), Catherine Zeta-Jones (""Ocean's Twelve"", ""Chicago"", ""The Terminal"") and Judy Greer (""13 Going on 30&#8243;, ""What Women Want"", ""Three Kings"").VIDEO:""Playing for Keeps"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The film is primarily shot outdoors and so the outdoor scenes look very good.  Skin tones are natural, colors are nice and sharp, for the most part, picture quality for this film is very good and well-detailed.  I detected no aliasing or excessive DNR during my viewing of the film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Playing for Keeps"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and includes an English - Audio Description Track.  The film is primarily dialogue and music driven and is primarily a center and front-channel soundtrack.  Dialogue is crystal clear as with the music by Andrea Guerra (""Hotel Rawanda"", ""The Pursuit of Happyness"", ""Nine"").Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Playing for Keeps"" come with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (10:17) A total of seven deleted scenes.The Playbook: Making Playing for Keeps - (8:24) Producers Jonathan Mostow and Heidi Jo Markel, director Gabriele Muccino, screenwriter Robbie Fox and the cast talk about ""Playing for Keeps"".  From the communication and cast working with Gabriele to having the right casting.Creating An All-Star Team: The Cast of Playing For Keeps - (6:34) A featurette about casting the role for ""Playing for Keeps"".EXTRAS:""Playing for Keeps"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows for one to download their film to a computer or on select Apple and Android devices and to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL:""Playing for Keeps"" is a romantic comedy that had potential considering its star power but in the end, was quite average.When you watch Gabriele Muccino films you expect a film to be uplifting, deep and enjoyable.  From films such as ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and ""Seven Pounds"", you expect to come out of a Muccino film, feeling inspired or just feeling that you just watched something that touches your soul.""Playing for Keeps"" is a film that should have relevance in today's society.  As many athletes who squandered their millions of dollars earned and are now in significant debt, the idea of ""Playing for Keeps"" came when producer Jonathan Mostow was at a soccer game for his child and in Hollywood fashion, talked to another father and they discussed, what if their coach was a former professional soccer player and the idea would eventually become a film.But as the film could have felt inspiring by showing us how a father would go at great lengths to be with his son and his mother, his former love... the film was almost like deja vu with Mel Gibson's 2ooo film ""What Women Want"" and puts too much focus on female characters who want to have sex with the main protagonist.Yes, this is the life of an athlete...being in love with one, yet having sex with many.  And I ask myself several times during the film, ""am I really watching a Gabriele Muccino"" film?"".A film that had potential of showing us an athlete who had suffered so much but finds redemption by being close to the people he loves, ends up to be what we see on ESPN or sports publications of athletes with faults and is able to have sex with a lot of women.  We know it happens, but do we want to see it on a film that is supposed to be about a father wanting to be close to his young son and his mother, his former love?And the fact that the film goes to length of showing how he hooks up with a divorced mother, a former sportscaster and then somehow forgetting those characters after he beds them.  But then we also have a sexy but depressed wife of a wealthy business owner managing to break into his landlord's home and his home, in hopes for a one night stand?  To a father allowing his young son drive an expensive Ferrari that doesn't belong to him.  There are just so many scenes that make you wonder ""why?"" and did I mention, asking oneself, ""am I really watching a Gabriele Muccino film?"".For all it's worth, the film is not terrible nor is it great.  It's an average film that plays out as a popcorn action movie that you can enjoy, as long as you don't expect anything to deep.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality for this film looked great on Blu-ray and the lossless soundtrack featured crisp and clear dialogue and a beautiful musical score from Andrea Guerra.  Special features were also fun to watch as the cast talked about how fun it was to work with director Gabriel Muccino but also difficult to understand what he is saying.Overall, ""Playing for Keeps"" can be an entertaining rom com diversion for those who just want to sit back and enjoy, as long as you are not expecting  something too deep.  But because Gabriele Muccino is a director known for working on inspiring and deep films, ""Playing for Keeps"" felt like a step back.  But I do admit that I enjoyed the film for its popcorn comedy but for the most part, the film was just average.  Nothing more, nothing less.",3,"Playing for Keeps"" can be an entertaining rom com diversion for those who just want to sit back and enjoy...",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,5562,"['director',

1604596,ACW4P33TPKDWW,B00A2H9UG6,Drew from Oregon,"[1, 3]","This review does contain spoilers.  I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this to review.Playing For Keeps is your typical romantic comedy that is loaded with an all-star cast including Gerard Butler, Jessica Biel, Uma Thurman, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Dennis Quaid among others.  Gerard Butler plays the character of George Dryer, a former Major League Soccer player who had sustained a career ending injury while playing in a game.  Although he was a soccer player overseas, he lives in the state of Virginia where his son, Lewis, lives so he can spend time with him.  His son lives with his ex-wife, Stacy, who's character is played by Jessica Biel, and her current fianc&eacute;, Matt.George does not have a job and he is in debt as he gets collection calls from collection agencies.  He starts working on a broadcasting audition tape so he can try to get a job in sports broadcasting.  He did visit the local TV station to drop off his audition tape, which didn't really seem to work out for him as the people at the television station didn't seem to want to give him the time of day.George's son, Lewis, plays on the local soccer team and it appears the team is in disarray and not really very good.  This can be attributed to their soccer coach who spends most of his time on his cell phone rather than actually teaching the kids proper technique.  While at one the soccer practices, George notices the soccer coach doesn't spend the time to teach the kids proper technique as they don't even know how to kick the ball, so he goes onto the field to teach all of them how to shoot a goal.  After giving these pointers to the kids, they all love George and they all want him to coach the soccer team to which George reluctantly agrees.Carl King, played by Dennis Quaid is a parent of one of the kids on the soccer team.  He appears to have a lot of money and seems to be drunk most of the time.  Carl meets George at one of the practices and gives him an envelope full of cash  as a means to possibly, pay off, George so his son can play goalie.  Carl says the money is to help out for uniforms and other things.  George takes the money.All of the soccer moms seem to be interested and infatuated with George as he is a handsome man.  Almost all of them flirt with George and some are very, very aggressive toward him, throwing themselves at him.  Barb, a soccer mom, shows up at George's house at random one night.  She's extremely aggressive toward George, even going to the point to show him her online dating profile.  After she leaves, she comes back right away and she and George sleep together.The next morning, George gets a phone call from Carl asking him for $10,000 to bail him out of jail.  Apparently, Carl, being the jealous type, got into a fight because he thought someone was trying to hook up with his wife.  George didn't have the money, so he had to go to Carl's house to get the $10,000.  While there, Carl's wife, Patty, played by Uma Thurman, flirts with George and makes it known that she is interested in him.  Nothing happens with George and Patty at this point as George was in a hurry to get Carl out of jail because there was a soccer game he had to get to.  It turns out that, because of the delay, George and his son, Lewis, missed the soccer game that day.Denise, another soccer mom, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, is a former sportscaster and calls George to tell him that his audition tape looks good.  They both go to the studio to make his audition tape look more professional, as ESPN was looking for new people.  After helping George with his audition tape, Stacy comes on to George and they sleep together in the studio.  That same night, Carl's wife is at George's place to try to sleep with him, but he tells her to leave and she finally does.The next day, while riding to the game, Lewis sees his dad kissing Denise at the soccer field before the game.  This makes Lewis upset and he starts to play really aggressive during the game and knocking other players down.  He receives a red card and gets kicked out of the game.  Lewis then expresses at this point that he wants to quit the soccer team.  After leaving the game, George asks Stacy to a late lunch to ask for parenting advice.  Both George and Stacy go to lunch together and talk about times past.  It's pretty much at this point where you can tell that they both still have feelings for each other.George gets a phone call from Denise telling him that she has good news for him and honks her car horn.  She was outside.  George goes outside to hear the news and Denise tells him that ESPN liked his audition tape.  Denise expected George to sleep with him, but he did not because he had Lewis with him and he seems like he wanted to change his ways at this point.George's ESPN audition at ESPN studios went great and they hired him.  He tells Stacy, while she's at the bridal shop trying on a dress, that he wants her and Lewis to move to Connecticut with him. To experience all that the state has to offer together.  She thinks about it and kisses and hugs George implying that she will move with him to Connecticut.At the final soccer game of the season, Carl gives an envelope to George telling him to look inside it.  In the envelope were pictures that a private investigator took of Carl's wife and George the night Patty was at George's house.  Carl thought George slept with her, when he did not.  They get into a little scuffle and the pictures get scattered everywhere on the ground.  Stacy walks over to George to see what was going on and she sees the pictures.  She assumes that George slept with Carl's wife as well and tells him good luck in Connecticut.When George says his good bye to Lewis, Stacy makes it known to Matt that she has never stopped loving George, which Matt already had a hunch.  As George is driving to Connecticut, he stops on the side of the road and thinks for a bit and turns around to head back to Virginia.  When he shows up at Stacy's house, George tells Stacy that he decided he was not going to take the job at ESPN, Stacy tells him that she called off the wedding and we can assume they are back together.George does finally get a job at the local TV station on the ""Chip & George Show.""Overall, this movie was an okay movie.  The acting was pretty good, but the story line was really one of those old clich&eacute; types that almost always happens.  Really, the end was fairly predictable and the movie, as a whole, really didn't do anything for me.  I would have liked to have seen Stacy find George in Connecticut rather than George go back to Virginia because the ESPN job is a far better job than the one at the local TV station.  I mean, why does George have to compromise?  It appears Stacy didn't even have a job.  At any rate, overall, this movie wasn't great, but it was tolerable.  I give this a 3/5 stars.Overall rating:  3/5 stars",3,Typical Hollywood Romantic Comedy,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,6901,"['review', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'receive',

1604605,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B00A2H9UG6,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[6, 16]","I have loved Geraldo Butler ever since his star-making turn in that unforgettable vehicle of Academy Award proportions called P.M.S., I Love You! I think that extremely positively rated and not-boring-in-the-slightest film really showed us (the greater movie-watching community of people) what fine acting chops Geraldo Butler possessed. I mean, going back several years, I can really only think of another movie--the exquisite, art house offering by the name of Never Back Down--that even comes close to besting P.M.S., I Love You. Thus, when I heard from my girlfriends at yoga class that Geraldo Butler would be in another finely acted, totally original feature, I jumped at the chance to go to a midnight screening, from which I have just gallivanted home, all the while arching my back so that I could retain my sense of being sexified.Geraldo Butler plays an ordinary, middle-aged male by the name of George, which is a normal enough name, by the way. However, George is not your ordinary middle-aged dude with low T, no! The George in this movie is a former professional warrior who becomes a soccer coach for his young son's soccer team. In this way, it is beyond the shadow of a doubt that Playing for Keeps is inarguably a movie with high originality and uniqueness. After all, when's the last time that this insanely derivative formula was ever tried for a movie? Never, that's when! It's not like this formulaic plot has ever been explored before in movies such a Ladybugs, Bend It Like Beckham and, of course, Nailin' Palin.When this movie unfolds, you, the moviegoer, are really rewarded for the price of the movie ticket by way of the complex-though-easy-to-understand plot. It turns out that George used to be a warrior for the city-state of Sparta, and he played a prominent role in helping to fend off an Oriental threat from the Persian Empire (now popularly known as the evil Iranians) in a last stand apparently called ""300."" After retiring from this ""300"" army--or it may have been the Navy or something, but I'm sure it was a fighting force of some kind--George finds that he is highly sexually attracted to all of the M/I/L/F (Mothers I'd Like to Filibuster) moms whose kids are on his son's soccer team. Talk about Hubba, Hubba!!!So basically, this highly intelligent, highly original and absolutely too clever by half movie is not just a derivative comedy with a soccer twist--it's also a sex-romp film where George, the single dad, fornicates to his middle-aged heart's content with all the M/I/L/F moms such as Catherine Zeta-Jones (50), Uma Thruman (48), Judy Greer (59) and Jessica Biel (38.5). Rowr is all I can say to such a highly sophisticated and classy plotline!Anywho, I proudly award this movie two big M/I/L/F/S up, and I can't wait until it is finally made available on home video. I know that I will have minutes and minutes of super fun watching it on my RCA VCR when the studio finally makes this gem of a delight available for home enjoyment-viewing.

George looks to mend his relationship with his son (Noah Lomax) and his ex Jessica Biel.  In an effort to prove himself as a parent, George starts coaching his son's soccer team.Butler makes the character an endearing wreck initially but the movie seems to loose it way at some point and focuses too much attention on the soccer moms. Judy Greer, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Uma Thurman play a variety of wacked out housewives, a crying divorcee, a seductive ex-sportscastress, and a trophy wife who all are eager to jump in bed with him and there are moments that provide some funny scenes.The problem to me is that the movie cannot make up its mind at what it wants to be, a romantic comedy or a more dramatic movie.

1604641,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00A2H9UG6,Mark Turner,"[4, 4]","The other day I found myself explaining to my niece what a formula movie was. For those who don't know it's a movie that follows a well used formulaic plot that we've seen over and over again with a twist on it to make it new. This sort of movie feels like we've seen it before with perhaps a different setting or characters, but yes we have seen it before. Gerard Butler seems to be making a living out of these sorts of films with an occasional new film in the mix. That doesn't make these bad films, just predictable, and each time Butler has made one I've found it enjoyable to view.This time around Butler plays George, an ex-professional soccer player who was once top in the field. Those days are long gone and now he finds himself trying to reconnect with his son Lewis (Noah Lomax), a boy he's neglected for some time since he and his wife Stacie (Jessica Biehl) divorced. Taking him to soccer practice one afternoon George is stunned at the inept coaching the team is receiving. Stepping in he begins to teach them the right way to play which eventually lands him the job of coaching the team.But coaching the team isn't the only thing George ends up doing. This group of soccer moms all find themselves hot for the coach. Not only that one of the fathers (Dennis Quaid) sees him as a possible friend and definitely someone he can take to a party to impress potential clients. Quaid goes so far as to reveal that he's having an affair but at the same time jealous of anyone who might take an interest in his wife (Uma Thurman).Seeing a possibility of things finally going right for him, George might not say he hopes to return to his ex-wife but you can see it in his eyes. That falls apart when he finds out that in three weeks she's getting married to Matt, the man she's been with for the last three years. It seems George's timing is always off.That comes to light again when he gets the chance to audition for ESPN as an announcer. If he gets the job it means leaving once again. As the film progresses, that becomes something harder and harder for him to do as he finally begins to build the bond with his son that should have been there from the start. Will he stay and work on his family life or go to ESPN? Will he find a way to win back the heart of his ex? Will he be able to stop the advances of nearly all the soccer moms? Being a formula film the answer to these questions is easy. The enjoyment lies in seeing how it plays out.The movie is an enjoyable film to sit back and watch. Butler is a natural in roles like this but my guess is he'd love a bit more of a challenge. Biehl is lovely as ever and displays a great acting ability, one that is shown by making a believable character. Over the top theatrics can kill a performance. Here, she comes off as just who the character is.Well made, well shot and predictable, the movie doesn't offer a whole lot that is new. While those who like formulaic films will take comfort in that, it also can lead to a movie that's nothing to get excited about either. I found myself wanting to like this film more but found it little more than light entertainment. It might make a nice film to watch for an evening but my guess is other than Butler and Biehl fans it won't be sitting on too many shelves.",3,NOT QUITE A GOAL,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,3266,"['other', 'day', 'found', 'explaining', 'niece', 'what', 'formula', 'movie', 'was', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'well', 'used', 'formulaic', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'over', 'again', 'twist', 'make', 'new', 'sort', 'movie', 'feels', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'perhaps', 'different', 'setting', 'characters', 'yes', 'have', 'seen', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'be', 'making', 'living', 'sorts', 'films', 'occasional', 'new', 'film', 'mix', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'films', 'just', 'predictable', 'time', 'Butler', 'made', 'one', ""'ve"", 'found', 'enjoyable', 'view.This', 'time', 'Butler', 'plays', 'George', 'ex-professional', 'soccer', 'player', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'top', 'field', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'now', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'son', 'Lewis', 'Noah', 'Lomax', 'boy', 'neglected', 'time', 'wife', 'Stacie', 'Jessica', 'Biehl', 'divorced', 'Taking', 'soccer', 'practice', 'one', 'afternoon', 'George', 'stunned', 'inept', 'coaching', 'team', 'receiving', 'Stepping', 'teach', 'right', 'way', 'play', 'eventually', 'job', 'coaching', 'team.But', 'coaching', 'team', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'George', 'up', 'doing', 'group', 'soccer', 'moms', 'find', 'hot', 'coach', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'fathers', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'possible', 'friend', 'definitely', 'someone', 'can', 'take', 'party', 'impress', 'potential', 'clients', 'Quaid', 'so', 'far', 'reveal', 'having', 'affair', 'same', 'time', 'jealous', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'take', 'interest', 'wife', 'Uma', 'Thurman', '.Seeing', 'possibility', 'things', 'finally', 'going', 'right', 'George', 'might', 'not', 'say', 'return', 'ex-wife', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'apart', 'when', 'out', 'three', 'weeks', 'getting', 'married', 'Matt', 'man', 'been', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'George', 'timing', 'always', 'off.That', 'light', 'again', 'when', 'chance', 'audition', 'ESPN', 'announcer', 'job', 'leaving', 'once', 'again', 'film', 'something', 'harder', 'harder', 'do', 'finally', 'build', 'bond', 'son', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'start', 'Will', 'stay', 'work', 'family', 'life', 'go', 'ESPN', 'Will', 'find', 'way', 'win', 'back', 'heart', 'ex', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'advances', 'nearly', 'soccer', 'moms', 'Being', 'formula', 'film', 'answer', 'questions', 'easy', 'enjoyment', 'seeing', 'how', 'out.The', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'Butler', 'natural', 'roles', 'guess', ""'d"", 'love', 'bit', 'more', 'challenge', 'Biehl', 'lovely', 'ever', 'great', 'acting', 'ability', 'one', 'shown', 'making', 'believable', 'character', 'top', 'theatrics', 'can', 'kill', 'performance', 'Here', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'who', 'character', 'is.Well', 'made', 'well', 'shot', 'predictable', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'whole', 'lot', 'new', 'who', 'like', 'formulaic', 'films', 'will', 'take', 'comfort', 'also', 'can', 'lead', 'movie', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'found', 'wanting', 'like', 'film', 'more', 'found', 'little', 'more', 'light', 'entertainment', 'might', 'make', 'nice', 'film', 'watch', 'evening', 'guess', 'other', 'Butler', 'Biehl', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sitting', 'too', 'many', 'shelves']",N/A

Basically a former famous soccer player/playboy/free spirited father decides to move closer to his son so that he can be a part of his life.

Even by the trifling standards of the garden variety romantic comedy, PFK (under the AWOL direction of Gabriele Muccino) offers a redemption and reconciliation tale so poorly told that continuity, script supervision and character development were apparently early morning electives that Mr. Muccino must have decided to blow off.Although I wasn't expecting much, in more skillful directorial hands a first-rate cast populated by Gerald Butler, Jessica Biel, Catherine Zeta Jones, Dennis Quaid, Uma Thurman and Judy Greer should have at least guaranteed a minimum level of weekend watchability.The story pivots around Gerald Butler's George, a retired David Beckham-esque soccer superstar who has returned to Virginia to reclaim his family and fortune decimated by a decade of bad decisions and bad luck. In an effort to reintroduce himself to his son Lewis (admirably played by Noah Lomax) George commandeers control of Lewis' junior soccer club and while teaching the team real skills inadvertently dampens the wardrobe of the gaggle of soccer moms (Thurman, Greer, Jones) who dutifully attend each practice and now race to bed George.This is where the film really comes of the tracks as each seduction scene reveals women with such pervasive insecurities and below-zero self-esteem that it is hard to imagine any of them as the accomplished and affluent inhabitants of the take no prisoners Beltway culture that they purport to be charter members of. All in all it's Wisteria Lane meets Hysteria Lame with not even a tangential connection between storylines.As if that weren't enough scripted ridiculousness for one sitting, all of these sleepy-time worst behavior hijinx takes place under the jaundiced eye of George's ex-wife (a Jessica Biel mail-in performance) who gamely decides that her naughty boy soccer stud is still the love of her life, compelling her to blow off the sturdy life and relationship that she has created post-divorce - with no plausible rationale as the clock ticks drearily towards the end credits. As an aside, I have too much respect for Dennis Quaid to even delve into his inexplicable presence in this film.

The main reason was that it looked like there may be more than that here. A deeper message maybe, and also an attempt at promoting football (yes, I said it) as a sport that should have the place it deserves in the US, since it is the most beautiful and exciting sport in the world.The story consists of an ex-pro player that was forced to retired after an injury. His life is in disarray. His ex-wife is getting married again; he is in debt up to his eyeballs and he does not have a job; and maybe most importantly, he is worried about losing the love of his son. When he sees that the soccer coach for his son's team pays no attention to the kids, he starts to get involved and soon the parents want him to take over as coach.Ultimately, when I asked myself: Does it do the job of making people in the US get a little closer to soccer?  The answer was, not really, but this is no reason to punish the movie, it is just a missed opportunity. The reason why this movie falls short is that it does feel as one of those movies that are a dime a dozen. The main differentiating factor is the cast, which is full of A-listers, including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quaid and Uma Thurman, and all of them do a great job with their characters. Especially those that have roles that make you grit your teeth due to their characters lacking a moral compass.Ultimately, this is a film that has its fun moments and its moving moments, but ends up being run of the mill. One of the main elements used to make is laugh has to do with the soccer-moms really being cougars on the prowl. An environment in which Dryer acts like a kid sometimes, which is pretty typical with adult soccer stars (and in other sports too I guess). He is pretty defenseless when all these women come after him.

1604675,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00A2H9UG6,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 1]","Before watching the DVD - I did not read any reviews. In fact I went in knowing only that this was a ""rom-com"" with a cast of well-knowns and it had something to do with a retired soccer star. As the film began I saw it as the story of a father - now a ""has been"", though not old - who couldn't meet his rent payment - who wanted to reconnect with his young son (who was living with the guy's ex-wife in the same small town). We've seen stories like this before. But soon after the guy (Gerald Butler) takes over coaching his son's team, Dennis Quaid (as one of the player's rich dad) arrives on the screen in over-the-top mode and the mod of the film goes silly. Not soon thereafter the local ""moms"" start seducing Butler and I'm reminded of the old Warren Beatty film ""Shampoo"". Then we get sentimental again. And then erotic again. And you wonder if he will, or won't, get back with his ex-wife. I won't tell you if they will as I don't like ""spoilers"". The cast is all A-list but they seem to be slumming. Some of my frustration is explained in the bonus features on the DVD (I got the DVD, not the BD but the features are both the same) so let me go into those (and let you read fellow reviewer Chris Kennison's review - which gives you the basics about the film).There are three bonus features:Review of DVD - Sometimes this rom-com goes too far over the top in sillinessSeven deleted scenes - total time about 10 minutes - one of which - if inserted - would have changed my feeling about Uma Thurman's  (as Quaid's wife) character.The ""Making of..."" featurette (about 8 minutes) and ""Creating the All Star Team: The Cast of Playing For Keeps"" - These two follow similar courses and could have been combined into one. It show interviews with the cast - mostly talking about their characters) and the Director - Who is Italian - not sure if mentioned by others, but this is an American film, filmed by a Italian director). During one of these featurettes - I can't remember which - there is mention of Beatty's ""Shampoo"" and Thurman and Catherine Zeta-Jones (looking stunning) both say it was ""fun to pay over the top characters"" (I'm paraphrasing here). Jessica Biel - as Butler's ex-wife has the most ""down-to-earth character"" and a few of the interviewees mention what a great - though underappreciated - actress she is.So, I'm not sorry I spent 106 minutes with the film but I've certainly seen better and I did find it hard to really care about any of the characters except Biel. Not even Butler - who I couldn't quite grasp. But watching a film is subjective and there will be those who really like this film. It's not great art but, at times, entertaining.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,Review of DVD - A-list cast  but sometimes this rom-com goes too far over the top in silliness,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,2759,"['watching', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'fact', 'went', 'knowing', 'only', 'was', 'rom-com', 'cast', 'well-knowns', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'retired', 'soccer', 'star', 'film', 'began', 'saw', 'story', 'father', 'now', 'been', 'not', 'old', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'meet', 'rent', 'payment', 'who', 'wanted', 'reconnect', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'guy', 'ex-wife', 'same', 'small', 'town', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'stories', 'before', 'soon', 'guy', 'Gerald', 'Butler', 'over', 'coaching', 'son', 'team', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'one', 'player', 'rich', 'dad', 'screen', 'over-the-top', 'mode', 'mod', 'film', 'silly', 'Not', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'local', 'moms', 'start', 'seducing', 'Butler', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'old', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'film', 'Shampoo', 'Then', 'get', 'sentimental', 'again', 'then', 'erotic', 'again', 'wonder', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', 'ex-wife', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'will', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'spoilers', 'cast', 'A-list', 'seem', 'be', 'slumming', 'frustration', 'explained', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'got', 'DVD', 'not', 'BD', 'features', 'are', 'same', 'so', 'let', 'go', 'let', 'read', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'Chris', 'Kennison', 'review', 'basics', 'film', 'are', 'three', 'bonus', 'features', 'Review', 'DVD', 'Sometimes', 'rom-com', 'too', 'far', 'top', 'sillinessSeven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'total', 'time', '10', 'minutes', 'one', 'inserted', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'feeling', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Quaid', 'wife', 'character.The', 'Making', 'featurette', '8', 'minutes', 'Creating', 'All', 'Star', 'Team', 'Cast', 'Playing', 'Keeps', 'two', 'follow', 'similar', 'courses', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'combined', 'one', 'show', 'interviews', 'cast', 'mostly', 'talking', 'characters', 'Director', 'Who', 'Italian', 'not', 'sure', 'mentioned', 'others', 'American', 'film', 'filmed', 'Italian', 'director', 'one', 'featurettes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'mention', 'Beatty', 'Shampoo', 'Thurman', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'looking', 'stunning', 'say', 'was', 'fun', 'pay', 'top', 'characters', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'here', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Butler', 'ex-wife', 'most', 'down-to-earth', 'character', 'few', 'interviewees', 'mention', 'what', 'great', 'underappreciated', 'actress', ""'m"", 'not', 'sorry', 'spent', '106', 'minutes', 'film', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'seen', 'better', 'did', 'find', 'hard', 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'Biel', 'Not', 'even', 'Butler', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'grasp', 'watching', 'film', 'subjective', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'really', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'art', 'times', 'entertaining.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

With a great cast including Jessica Biel, Gerard Butler, Judy Greer, Dennis Quaid, Uma Thurman and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the film should be something amusing, which it is not. Directed by Gabriel Muccino (""The Pursuit of Happyness"" ""Seven Pounds""), ""Playing for Keeps"" is also bland as a father-son drama, despite the charms of the star Gerard Butler, who is given a chance to show his romantic side.Gerard Butler, known as an avid Celtic Football Club fan, plays George Dryer, a retired professional soccer player now living in America. His relationship with his son Lewis (Noah Lomax) is not going well. His ex-wife Stacie (Jessica Biel) is going to marry another guy.Things get better when George starts teaching soccer for children. Good-looking and affable George gets attention from ""soccer moms."" As he gets popular, his relationship with his son improves. Also, he gets a job opportunity. And ... it goes on and on until another setback occurs. Then George learns a lesson. And then....Besides its lackluster storytelling, ""Playing for Keeps"" suffers from so many things. The film needs more credible situations (a former Celtic superstar out of job?

Divorced father living a failed life.  Beautiful ex-wife now engaged to successful man.  A shared custody of a confused kid.  And the rest of the plot as fluffy as a popcorn kernel.  God, movies are so bad these days.Okay, lets start with Gerard.  Oh, dear ladies, please do not shoot me.  Yes, I love him.  Do I like the roles he chooses?  Absolutely not.  He's been on a downer lately of bad films that have done nothing for his career except make him look as scruffy as he does in this movie.The role of the deadbeat dad is the typical failed man trying to find his way back to a semblance of self-esteem.  Once a well-known and highly regarded soccer player, he is now broke, divorced, and struggling to find work and self-worth again.  His ex-wife, who is far better than he, has gone on to find an upstanding and handsome man to marry.  She lives the good life in a big home with her soon-to-be husband and son, compared to scruffy George who looks like he hasn't had a bath in a month.Side plot?  Well, not much.  Women going after the single dad (why I have no idea by the way he looks).  Dennis Quaid's role was frankly ridiculous.  Oh, God, don't get me started on this horrible movie.Sigh . . . I love Gerard, but gosh I wish he would hold out for roles that use his talent to the max.  How about a business suit, a clean-shaven face, a haircut, and a role that challenges him to strut his stuff? Sometimes I wonder if his current appearance isn't mirroring the way he feels about his own career.  He's so much better than these cheesy movies.So yes, George, in the movie turns his life around.  He gets a job as a sportscaster and gets his wife back. All ends happily ever after but it takes a painful 105 minutes to get there.I love you, Gerard, but I long to see you clean shaven, with a hair cut, and flashing those pretty eyes and seducing the ladies with that fine Scottish accent of yours.
