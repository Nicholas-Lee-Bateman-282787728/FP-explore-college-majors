Enter Larry Crowne, a romantic comedy pairing up the Charlie Wilson's War co-stars, directed and co-written by Hanks. Here, the titular character is a recently downsized retail employee who decides to enroll in community college, where he meets various new friends and falls in love with his Public Speaking instructor. Unfortunately, while the film's two stars are certainly likeable and are able to maintain a relaxed chemistry, I found the story all too conventional and bland, earning Larry Crowne a mere one star. Fans of both stars may enjoy the film, but as it stands, it's a missed opportunity for two very capable powerhouse actors.",1,Larry Crowne,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,890,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'were', 'once', 'highly', 'sought-after', 'stars', 'having', 'won', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Actress', 'categories', 'respectively', 'earned', 'much', 'critical', 'recognition', 'lately', 'used', 'Enter', 'Larry', 'Crowne', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'pairing', 'up', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'co-stars', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Hanks', 'Here', 'titular', 'character', 'recently', 'downsized', 'retail', 'employee', 'who', 'enroll', 'community', 'college', 'where', 'various', 'new', 'friends', 'falls', 'love', 'Public', 'Speaking', 'instructor', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'certainly', 'likeable', 'are', 'able', 'maintain', 'relaxed', 'chemistry', 'found', 'story', 'too', 'conventional', 'bland', 'earning', 'Larry', 'Crowne', 'mere', 'one', 'star', 'Fans', 'stars', 'may', 'enjoy', 'film', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'two', 'very', 'capable', 'powerhouse', 'actors']",Larry Crowne

While there are gaps in sensibility (caution - minor plot reveals here - like a college professor not knowing how many students are in a class until she walks in on the first day or someone dropping out of school the week before finals), they are not so bad as to distract from the charm inherent in a Tom Hanks movie.  While I would have much rather seen Meg Ryan play the romantic interest for Mr. Hanks, Julia Roberts does an adequate job.

Just when things look to be going south, the whole movie turns around and becomes a feel-good show. Most of the characters turn out to be nice and look on course to have a happy ending. There are a number of secondary characters that are fairly interesting in the show. There isn't a ton of romantic fire between Hanks' character and Roberts' but it's serviceable.

There was something about the ending that simply didn't rub me the right way. I don't know if it was the writing or the choppy way it was pasted together. Either way, it was an OK ending, but the overall story was enjoyable. I think the topic of the film perfectly captures middle class America in contemporary times and in this job market. The film almost takes a Capra-esque turn but writers Hanks and Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) seem to want to make this film their own, which is OK but it would've been better if they had stuck with the path they were going down for the first two-thirds of the movie. Hanks and Roberts have wonderful chemistry (seeCharlie Wilson's War (Widescreen Edition)) and the cast was stellar -- especially Gugu Mbatha-Raw (J.J. Abrams' failed NBC series ""Undercovers"") who plays the upbeat Talia.

1461477,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005HWAOHK,B. E Jackson,"[8, 17]","Larry Crowne HAS to be the worst movie I've seen this year, and I've watched plenty so far.  At least 50 movies.  It lacks everything.  There's nothing at *all* appealing about anything taking place.  It's hard to fathom the reason why it even exists.It's about Tom Hanks' character going back to college after getting fired from his job despite his persistent claims that serving in the Navy should provide security for his position.  From there, well, we meet his neighbor (Cedric the Entertainer's character) and what he does is bargain with people concerning the things he's selling.  The entire communication and bargaining techniques taking place between Cedric and Tom Hanks was tortorous to watch because of how utterly pointless it is.  To make matters worse, Cedric *continues* with the same gimmick for a few more segments later on.When Tom finally goes back to college, we meet Julia Roberts' character which is that of a teacher- a job she apparently despises.  On the first day of school she actually counts how many students are in the classroom and when she discovers there's only 9 students present, she threatens to walk out but... in comes Tom Hanks ready and eager to learn.  This particular segment is an example of comedy recycled from much older films (mainly ones from the 80's) and used again here with less interesting results.  WAY less interesting.  It doesn't work in todays world.Now tell me, because I *really* want to know... how in the WORLD is this supposed to be a comedy?  How in the WORLD is it supposed to be a romance?  Because the film does neither one of these things.  Alright, so Tom and Julia fall in love but there's never any excitement leading into the kissing and holding- it more or less just happens.  There's never any believable reason why it's happening either.  The entire plot... well let's not kid ourselves, there is *no* plot to speak of whatsoever.Tom Hanks simply goes to college, hangs around typical college kids, learns to make speeches that are supposedly enticing to Julia's character and... and oh, let me mention another important aspect.  This HAS to be the most boring college in existence.  The kids are unentertaining, the classes are dull and empty, everyone and everything is flat out boring.  The college professor is the only enticing aspect of the movie, and he's only funny because of how hard he tries to be clever and just ends up not making a bit of sense to any of his students.  Obviously that failed ""smart"" phone joke was a major low point.  The speeches themselves -both from Tom Hanks and his students (especially the crappy Star Wars/Deep Space 9 one) was horrible beyond description.Only the joke involving Julia Roberts' husband mentioning female breasts and Julia knocking him for his porn collecting habit made me laugh, and that's only because of how Julia reacted to it.  The diner segment at the end and the conversation Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts were having was horrendous because, without spoiling what happens, Julia completely lacked emotion here.  Her lines seemed very forced, uncaring and unnatural.  Otherwise, this is a complete waste of time.  The humor is clearly way WAY off.

He gets fired because of his lack of college education, which prevents him from advancing any further in the job. So, after a job search, he goes to college, where he expands his horizons with new friends and new experiences. Julia Roberts plays a speech professor who seems burned out from her job, and has a loser husband who spends his days surfing porn. This movie is often classified as a romantic comedy. But, I see it more as simply a Tom Hanks comedy. While the eventual romantic pairing of Hanks and Roberts may qualify as romantic comedy, the majority of the movie is the comedy of Hanks and Roberts in their individual lives. And, personally, I think Julia Roberts is the wrong choice for this part. There's nothing wrong with her performance, but I think another actress would fit the role better. You will enjoy the extraneous characters as well; Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Talia - Larry's first college friend, Cedric the Entertainer as Larry's neighbor - who runs a year-round yard sale, George Takei as Larry's Economics professor, Rita Wilson (Hanks' real life wife) as the mortgage banker at Larry's bank.

1461489,AVV1ACH67XI85,B005HWAOHK,"Davalon ""Davalon""","[10, 18]","It is hard for me to understand what the point or purpose of this film is/was supposed to be. Let's start with the title: ""Larry Crowne."" For some reason, the screenwriters (Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos) seem to think that this name is inherently funny. As the lead character, Hanks points out several times that his name last name is ""Crowne, with an 'e'."" Okay... and... ? Who cares? What about this name qualifies it as the title of the movie? Oh. Okay. It's a movie about a man no one knows or cares about, ""Larry Crowne."" Oh. I get it. Okay, and... then what happens? Nothing. Huh. I see.Within the first six minutes of the movie, Larry gets downsized from his job at ""U-Mart."" Since we have just met Larry, we do not care. Upon being summoned over the loudspeaker, Larry and his co-worker (Randall Park, one of the many ""minority"" actors sprinkled throughout the movie to give the illusion that white people are not, in fact, running the world) assume that Larry will probably be named ""Employee of the Month"" for the tenth time. Wrong. Because Larry doesn't have a college education, he cannot be promoted to upper management status. (And yet... he was good enough to be ""Employee of the Month"" nine times.) This is explained to him by four joyless ""managers."" You would think that such an invaluable employee would be worth fighting for. Apparently not.Then we see Larry returning to a fabulous home in the Southern California Valley. How is it possible that Larry, who was a cook in the navy for 20 years (during which time he apparently got married, raised two kids with his wife, and then divorced his wife and bought out her share of the house) was able to get this fabulous house? I say fabulous by middle-class standards. It appeared to be a nice-sized ranch house. I simply couldn't believe how, as a lower-level manager (who seemed more like a regular staff member) at U-Mart, Larry could have possibly covered the mortgage on this house. But, okay, that is the set-up we were given.Then we meet Larry's neighbors Lamar (Cedric the ""E"") and B'Ella (Taraji P. Henson). For starters, look at the time and effort put into the name ""B'Ella."" Who is going to care or know that an apostrophe is placed after ""B""? I'll let that go for the moment. Lamar and B'Ella apparently have a daily yard sale in which Lamar cleverly bargains with every customer that comes by. Okay. So what? Who cares? In what way did this ""subplot"" have anything to do with anything? But more importantly, when Larry loses his job, he subtly indicates that it must be great for Lamar not to have to worry about money (because Lamar won $500,000 on a ""Wheel-of-Fortune"" type game). What bothered me about this is that Lamar and B'Ella were black. Now, of course, anyone can win that game. But what it said about the black man in this movie is that he won the game, he got the money, he doesn't have to worry about getting a job... but poor old white Larry is gonna have to start collectin' the unemployment checks (which he apparently never does) and start from square one again lookin' for a job (which he does for about one minute before he apparently gives up). Gimme a break!Then, because U-mart management indicated that if Larry had some sort of college education, he'd be able to get a higher-level job (duh, really? Oh, is that what you find out at age 55 after working for 35 years?), Larry decides to go to community college. Okay, great.In the first five minutes of going to CC, he meets a hot cute babe named Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who is a member of a motorbike ""gang,"" who, of course, is not threatening in any possible way. Talia, other than showing up in the two classes Larry ends up taking, apparently has no other life except roaming the streets of sunny SoCal with her bike buds. She takes an instant liking to Larry and, throughout the course of the film, makes it her mission to ""re-invent"" him. Unlike other critics, who believe it would be impossible for such a woman to find someone as ancient as Tom Hanks appealing, I could buy her attraction to him. However, this is another story thread that has no meaning or value whatsoever in the film, except in the minds of the screenwriters. After Larry's encounter with Talia (who, by the way, has renamed herself Talia, because ""that's who I see when I look in the mirror""--and, as such, decides that Larry should be named Lance Corona--oh, how cute and adorable!), Larry goes in to register for classes and immediately meets the school administrator (Dale Dye?), who encourages Larry to take a public speaking class. ""It will change your life"" he says, and the instructor is easy on the eyes--or words to the effect. What is the point?  So, this means that Larry has no plan or idea of what he is going to take? And therefore takes the class because the administrator tells him it will change his life? Right. What a take-charge kind of guy you are, Larry!Finally we meet Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts), the speech instructor. Now, I love Julia and have seen all her movies. I personally enjoyed that she went against type in this film and played a jaded, alcoholic mess. It was fun seeing her choices as this type of person... but ultimately, the audience does not want to see Julia this way. We love her too much as the whipsmart girl/woman who can slay someone with a well-timed one-liner. In this movie, despite her best efforts, it is hard to care about her or her circumstances.At this point, I suppose, one could say the movie ""begins."" But this is what happens: Larry lets the bank foreclose on his house because he can't pay the mortgage anymore (but has plenty of free time to go biking with Talia and her pals); we meet Mercedes's porn-surfing blogger husband whose only interest in life appears to be women with big breasts, and, after admitting to such, is promptly dumped by Mercedes (or ""Mercy"" or ""Marcy"" as she is referred to in the film); Larry spends endless amounts of time with Talia, who has a hot, steamy, jealous boyfriend (Wilmer Valderrama), who, unless I'm blind, wouldn't mind a roll in the hay with Larry under the right circumstances; endless scenes in Mercedes's classroom, where Larry and the other loser students (including Grace Gummer, Meryl's daughter!) stumble through half-assed attempts to make speeches based on assignments given by an angry, irritated, slightly hungover Mercedes; Mercedes's inexplicable attraction to Larry... and... where was I going with this? Oh. Right. Nowhere. Which is exactly where this movie goes.I don't get what the point of this entire experience was supposed to be. It seems like Hanks and Vardalos sat down one afternoon, shared a bottle of wine, came up with some sketch ideas that they obviously thought were alternately hysterically funny (endless jokes about the last names of Larry, Mercedes, and a student named ""Steve Dibiasi"") and ""touching"" (a tearful Larry driving away from his beloved neighborhood as B'Ella cries into Lamar's shoulder).Throughout all of this drivel, I am not given one reason whatsoever to care about a single person in the entire film. And so I don't. Didn't. Can't.In addition, there were other things about this movie that I found deeply disturbing. First, what is so fascinating about a middle-aged person who goes to CC? Nothing.  Other irritating points: Larry had to be the only person of his age in the class, and the class had to be ""racially balanced,"" giving the filmmakers an opportunity to make sure  the Screen Actors Guild was happy. Okay, they were racially balanced. Did they all have to be so uniformly dull or stupid? Some of them, as we eventually saw, actually had a spark when they gave their little speeches on whatever topic they grabbed out of Mercedes's box (get your minds out of the gutter). That said, why should we have cared about Mercedes? It was her job to teach people; but apparently in this movie, it was her job to find a man to replace the ""loser"" (that's what she called him, and I concur) that she married. As other critics have pointed out, this movie does a disservice to CC teachers and, actually, to the students who attend them. It was, the more I think about it, vulgar and insulting.Which leads me to my main point: This whole film could have been so much more than it was. Why couldn't it have been about a man, Hanks, really down on his luck, to the point that unless he finished two more classes of college credits, he really would not be able to get his life back on track. In one of those two classes he meets a jaded, ""I hate my life"" professor who has lost her love for what she probably does quite well--teaching people how to speak in public. In this new version of ""Larry Crowne"" (which of course would never have such a ghastly title, and instead would be called something like ""Speechless"" or ""Larry Gets His Life Back""), Larry and Mercedes's paths would intersect in a dramatic way, with each impacting the other's in such a way as their lives are transformed... with the great one-liners and bits of humor these two wonderful actors are capable of delivering. In fact, one can sense that there is a movie buried within this movie, but, honestly, Hanks and Vardalos sat around the pool way too long in the hot SoCal sun and thought this tale of some middle-aged man who loses his low-level lifer job (or so he mistakenly thought!) would be of interest. It could have been, but it fails on every single possible level. (That doesn't mean I don't love Tom and Julia, I do.)Finally, what in the hell is wrong with Tom Hanks's face? He goes from looking like the Pillsbury Doughboy to a wax statue version of himself to someone who has just had a bad facelift to bad hair/good hair days, to squinty-eyed freak to tired old codger... honestly, I couldn't stand looking at him. And Tom, honey, you know, yeah, you've had a helluva lot of success, and yeah, you are getting on in life, but, honestly, you need to lose weight. I'm sorry, but if I wanted to watch a movie about a middle-aged man who turns his life from ""loserdom"" to ""winnerdom"" I'd much prefer watching someone who actually respects himself enough to get back into shape. Honestly, don't you think that would have been part of Larry's ""transformation""? Even Julia has a moment on an exercise bike (encouraged by Pam Grier [of all people! Didn't even know it was her!] her gal pal-colleague-someone in the movie who I had know idea what they were doing in it--and, oh, girl, please! Do not wear screaming orange sweatshirts tied around your waist!).All in all, an absolute, unmitigated disaster, concluding with an unbelievable moment during the end credits where Tom and Julia, who are riding on a motorcycle--without helmets (indicating, what? They're invulnerable? They're ""free""? They're ""celebrities""?)--actually wave to the audience! WTF?The best thing about this mess, other than the one minute where Julia flashes her mega-watt smile near the end, is the closing credits song, ""Calling America"" by ELO. Tom, good choice!

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 3]","The indifference I feel having watched LARRY CROWNE is voluminous; this is a cute, light, dramedy about a mid-life good guy reinventing himself, and a bored and tired community college professor discovering love is no longer an emotion in the past tense.  And that's it, folks; there is nothing substantive in the slightest, the film has its share of interesting, even compelling, moments, but other than that, it's like taking a gulp of air.  With LARRY CROWNE, there's not much 'there' there.Our good guy Larry (Tom Hanks) is a Navy vet who has just been laid off stocking shelves and herding shopping carts at the local grocery giant; he was sacked because he didn't have a college degree, meaning no company advancement (to what?  the cash register?).  A divorcee with an underwater mortgage, Larry decides to downsize and get that college degree; he enrolls in a speech class, taught by a decidedly indifferent Mercedes (Julia Roberts), who is in a lifeless marriage with a writer addicted to internet porn (at least Bryan Cranston brings some energy to his role).  Cool college student Talia (a stunning Gugu MBatha-Raw) suddenly takes Larry under her wing, changing his clothes, his hair style, his flat--she even gets him into a scooter gang, all of it begging one burning question:  Why?  Meanwhile Larry discovers he harbors more than platonic feelings for his speech teacher, who responds with a bored yawn, and only shows interest after dumping her husband.  (So in essence, LARRY CROWNE is a story about love on the rebound.)  Various other subplots and storylines are thrown in (but not worth mentioning), culminating in a surreal get-together at Larry's flat (where did all of Mercedes' intense passion come from?), and Larry and Mercedes ride their scooter into romantic bliss.  All in all, there are some moments worth watching, yet most of LARRY CROWNE is phoned in and ambivalent and as bland as a scoop of vanilla on a sugarless waffle cone.

1461497,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B005HWAOHK,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","The tepid reviews that this 2011 dramedy is receiving have been pervasive, yet there is something innately Capraesque about Tom Hanks' sophomore directorial effort, his first since 1996'sThat Thing You Do!. The movie proudly wears its heart on its sleeve, and the commitment that Hanks shows in his character's plight goes a long way to compensate for the episodic, by-the-numbers screenplay co-written by Hanks and Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding). The screenplay is what makes the film a bit disheartening to watch since its amiable nature and can-do sensibilities don't produce much in the way of compelling conflict. The concept appears timely, but the treatment feels like a Hollywood studio-manufactured version of what happens when sudden unemployment and economic hardship alter your reality.The title character is a divorced man in his mid-fifties who is the ideal employee in a Walmart-type store after spending nearly twenty years as a cook in the Navy. Thinking he was about to win another employee of the month award, Larry finds out that he is the victim of a downsizing ostensibly due to his lack of a college degree and consequently being told he has reached his maximum growth potential with the store. In order to ensure that he never has this problem again, Larry enrolls in a local community college where he is advised to take an introductory economics course and a class on public speaking where he meets a lovely but disillusioned professor named Mercedes Tainot, herself dealing with a bad marriage and a drinking problem. Larry also acquires a scooter and attracts the strictly platonic attention of a fellow student named Tania, a free spirit who is a member of a harmlessly hip scooter gang and makes him over to look more fashion forward.Little time is spent on Larry's actual economic situation, and Hanks uses the convenient device of a pretentious loan officer (played comically by his wife, Rita Wilson) to explain what Larry has to do to curtail his sinking mortgage payments. Along the way, he finds a job as a line cook at a diner, makes new friends, and learns to loosen up a little and enjoy the small things in life. At first, Hanks as an actor appears to be inForrest Gumpmode as Larry, avuncular and docile to the point of appearing mentally challenged, but then he gravitates toward hisYou've Got Mailcharacter when he sets out to win Roberts' heart. As Mercedes, Roberts seems to be sliding into middle age a lot smoother than I would have expected from an actress whose popularity peaked a decade ago. She's certainly a lot more endearing here than she was in her navel-gazing exercise last year,Eat Pray Love.Gugu Mbatha-Raw is appealing as Tania, but her character is probably the most unbelievable in the story. As Larry's constantly huckstering neighbor, Cedric the Entertainer is used primarily for comic relief, while Taraji P. Henson has a barely-there role as his perky wife. So does Pam Grier who provides her earthy presence all far too briefly as Mercedes' fellow faculty member. Bryan Cranston has the predictable role of Mercedes' porn-surfing, no-account husband and plays him exactly to formula.

1461498,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005HWAOHK,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","LARRY CROWNE (prod./dir. Tom Hanks, writ. by Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos, 2011) is just about the sweetest guy you'll ever meet. Played to perfection by Tom Hanks - whom I reckon had no need to stretch to play this role - Larry and his story will actually take you back to the very first sophisticated comedies of the 1930s. After losing his job at the ubiquitous ""U-Mart"" for not having a degree, Larry is readily convinced to attend college. He goes to his local community college and it seems the doors to Paradise are open to him.This reminds me of two precious comedies, the very first of their kind: Buster Keaton'sDoughboys [VHS] (see my review) and the Harold Lloyd-Adolphe Menjou comedy from 1936,The Milky Way. That in itself speaks volumes. In this age of jackass guffaws and cheap, filthy humor, this is a film all five generations of the family can enjoy together - and perhaps learn from it. They haven't made them like this for a long time.The beauty of this plain, simple yet so very important film is that every moment of it is true life. Pure, plain and true. You may not have experienced things in the order or fashion that Larry Crowne does, but you'll recognize everything here. From the tough times to the hilarious sideways observations of quirky human nature, you'll love it all because you know it all. What this film does is actually a bit of a 180 from my contention that the job of cinema is to show us something we'd otherwise never see.The beauty of this film is that it so sweetly reminds us of what we have known and seen for so long. It escapes me why so many critics panned it and it now languishes, forgotten. If it is reminiscent of Rodney Dangerfield'sBack To School, the reminiscence begins and ends with a grown man attending college for the first time.Nia Vardalos co-wrote this with Hanks, and she has a most powerful way with writing when she keeps out of the films. Whilst I can honestly say I like Julia Roberts a bit more now than ever before because of this, I shudder to think of Vardalos having taken that role. Hanks produced this, and the rather whimsical irony of Hanks playing someone diametrically opposed to him economically ... well, in any case Hanks plays a man who is his equal as a gentleman, a humanitarian, a plucky survivor and something of a wit.To Hanks' critics I say the following. Please! What do you want from a man who first appeared on an episode of ""The Love Boat"", whose breakout role was 1984's SPLASH and has gone on to produce this film, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, MY LIFE IN RUINS, CITY OF EMBER, MAMMA MIA!, HBO's JOHN ADAMS, MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING (his first project with Vardalos; this is his third), CASTAWAY and a dozen others? From the man who directed this film and THAT THING YOU DO!, from the man who wrote this movie, BAND OF BROTHERS and FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON?You should be so talented, prolific - and lucky.With wonderful performances, from George Takei (God, he is funny and weird, and I'm so glad to see him as the goofy economics professor) to Larry's perennial yard-sale-holding neighbor Cedric the Entertainer (I love him equally), this is a film you do not want to miss. DO NOT WANT TO MISS. Wilmer Valderrama, with several unfortunate films under his belt, is finally showing his star potential here - as do all the other players.The ELO songs - ""Hold On Tight to Your Dreams"" at the beginning and ""Calling America"" at the end - made me weep. That's because they took me back to a time when my wife and I danced to these same songs when they were brand new. The whole film will give you this feeling, whether you know ELO or not. It will let you know how and why films like this were first made, back in the 1930s.Best of all, it will show you, draw you in, teach you a new view - it may even change your life.",5,"""Spek-tak-uhlar!!""",1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,3811,"['LARRY', 'CROWNE', 'prod./dir', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'writ', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', '2011', 'just', 'sweetest', 'guy', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'meet', 'Played', 'perfection', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'whom', 'reckon', 'had', 'need', 'stretch', 'play', 'role', 'Larry', 'story', 'will', 'actually', 'take', 'back', 'very', 'first', 'sophisticated', 'comedies', '1930s', 'losing', 'job', 'ubiquitous', 'U-Mart', 'not', 'having', 'degree', 'Larry', 'readily', 'convinced', 'attend', 'college', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'doors', 'Paradise', 'are', 'open', 'him.This', 'reminds', 'two', 'precious', 'comedies', 'very', 'first', 'kind', 'Buster', ""Keaton'sDoughboys"", '[', 'VHS', ']', 'see', 'review', 'Harold', 'Lloyd-Adolphe', 'Menjou', 'comedy', '1936', 'Milky', 'Way', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'age', 'jackass', 'guffaws', 'cheap', 'filthy', 'humor', 'film', 'five', 'generations', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'perhaps', 'learn', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'long', 'time.The', 'beauty', 'plain', 'simple', 'yet', 'so', 'very', 'important', 'film', 'moment', 'true', 'life', 'Pure', 'plain', 'true', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'experienced', 'things', 'order', 'fashion', 'Larry', 'Crowne', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'everything', 'here', 'tough', 'times', 'hilarious', 'sideways', 'observations', 'quirky', 'human', 'nature', ""'ll"", 'love', 'know', 'What', 'film', 'actually', 'bit', '180', 'contention', 'job', 'cinema', 'show', 'something', ""'d"", 'otherwise', 'never', 'see.The', 'beauty', 'film', 'so', 'sweetly', 'what', 'have', 'known', 'seen', 'so', 'long', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'panned', 'now', 'forgotten', 'reminiscent', 'Rodney', ""Dangerfield'sBack"", 'School', 'reminiscence', 'grown', 'man', 'attending', 'college', 'first', 'time.Nia', 'Vardalos', 'co-wrote', 'Hanks', 'most', 'powerful', 'way', 'writing', 'when', 'films', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'like', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'bit', 'more', 'now', 'ever', 'shudder', 'think', 'Vardalos', 'having', 'taken', 'role', 'Hanks', 'produced', 'rather', 'whimsical', 'irony', 'Hanks', 'playing', 'someone', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'economically', 'well', 'case', 'Hanks', 'man', 'who', 'equal', 'gentleman', 'humanitarian', 'plucky', 'survivor', 'something', 'wit.To', 'Hanks', 'critics', 'say', 'following', 'Please', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'appeared', 'episode', 'Love', 'Boat', 'role', 'was', '1984', 'SPLASH', 'gone', 'produce', 'film', 'WHERE', 'THE', 'WILD', 'THINGS', 'ARE', 'MY', 'LIFE', 'IN', 'RUINS', 'CITY', 'OF', 'EMBER', 'MAMMA', 'MIA', 'HBO', 'JOHN', 'ADAMS', 'MY', 'BIG', 'FAT', 'GREEK', 'WEDDING', 'first', 'project', 'Vardalos', 'third', 'CASTAWAY', 'dozen', 'others', 'man', 'who', 'directed', 'film', 'THING', 'YOU', 'DO', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'movie', 'BAND', 'OF', 'BROTHERS', 'FROM', 'THE', 'EARTH', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOON', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'talented', 'prolific', 'lucky.With', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'George', 'Takei', 'God', 'funny', 'weird', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'see', 'goofy', 'economics', 'professor', 'Larry', 'perennial', 'yard-sale-holding', 'neighbor', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'love', 'equally', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WANT', 'TO', 'MISS', 'Wilmer', 'Valderrama', 'several', 'unfortunate', 'films', 'belt', 'finally', 'showing', 'star', 'potential', 'here', 'do', 'other', 'players.The', 'ELO', 'Hold', 'Tight', 'Your', 'Dreams', 'beginning', 'Calling', 'America', 'end', 'made', 'weep', 'took', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'wife', 'danced', 'same', 'songs', 'when', 'were', 'brand', 'new', 'whole', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'feeling', 'know', 'not', 'will', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'why', 'films', 'were', 'first', 'made', 'back', '1930s.Best', 'will', 'show', 'draw', 'teach', 'new', 'view', 'may', 'even', 'change', 'life']",Larry Crowne

1461508,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005HWAOHK,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","LARRY CROWNE is not a bad movie, it is simply an unremarkable movie.  Seeing the opening credits read 'A Tom Hanks Production', and 'written by Tom Hanks (with Nia Vardalos)', 'directed by Tom Hanks', 'starring Tom Hanks', with cameos by Rita Wilson (Mrs. Tom Hanks) and Chet Hanks (son of Tom Hanks), we know we are in for a 'Tom Hanks family outing'. So expect a feel good flick - and that is what is delivered.  Not that feel good flicks are a bad thing - in this particular time we need more of them.  But LARRY CROWNE seems to candy coat the current major problem of economic disaster by making it funny.  It's not.Larry Crowne is a happy-go-lucky top employee of a Walmart/Target/Home Depot type store named UMart, voted best employee of the month nine times, and suddenly is laid off because he has no college education that would allow him to advance in the ranks of management of the huge megapolis-everything store (Larry spent 20 years in the Navy as a cook instead of going to college). Recently divorced, he owes money on his house (his discussion with the bank is in the person of Rita Wilson!), and he is unable to find work. Larry decides to enroll in the local  community college where he mets the pixie-like Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a sparkling personality on screen) and her boyfriend Dell Gordo (Wilmer Valderrama) and their little motor scooter gang (including Grace Gummer, another of Meryl Streep's daughters). Talia takes Larry under her wing, dresses him like a college student and spiffs up his home while attending the same classes as Larry - Econ (with the weasley Dr Matsutani played to the hilt by George Takei), and Speech taught by Mercedes (Mercy) Tainot (Julia Roberts) who is usually hungover, drinks too much in order to tolerate her useless husband (Bryan Cranston), and tries every trick to get out of teaching her disinterested students. Larry's developing new self (he has a job as a short order cook in a diner now) meets the change factor in his life - Mercy - who because of his kindness and gentlemanly ways attracts Mercy. That of course progresses into predictable situations.The other aspect of the film that is actually the most touching is the relationship between Larry and his neighbors Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer) and Bella (Taraji P. Henson) who are in a constant state of yard sale: these two actors provides some of the finest scenes in the film.  Larry Crowne joins Talia and Dell Gordo in a motor scooter gang, changes his appearance and outlook, and with the help of his new relationship with Mercy he manages to come up happy.  In the end the film (despite some good cameo roles) pretty much wastes Hanks and Roberts in an out of focus antidote to the current state of mass unemployment.  LARRY CROWNE tries hard but the bumbling big bird of an airplane just never makes it off the ground.

He's at midlife, 20 year Navy vet, but has to college degree. No future at UMart. Out!Wilma (Rita Wilson, Hank's real wife) from the bank loan desk suggests life changes due to finances. College classes are the obvious answer and Larry enrolls into a Speech 217 class with Ms Mercades `Mercy' Teinot (Julia Roberts) his teacher. ""'Tai-no' not `Tai-NO'"" instructs the sour teacher a bit grumpy from living with a porn fanatic. Don't expect a sudden romance on this scene.An unexpected flirtatious delight is student Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw -also HOT in `Bonekickers') who takes Larry under her wing and gets him involved in a scooter gang. This takes form of some Gump-like events. The speech class is quite a mix of 9 other quirky characters including Natalie (Grace Gummer, Meryl Streep's daughter-you can't miss that face).Mercy is called ""washboard"" by her boob-loving spouse, soon to be discarded. Later viewed in a low-cut dress, Mercy proves she's not flat--she's a Pretty Woman. That leaves a romance available, right?

1461516,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005HWAOHK,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I'll try to not dump on LARRY CROWNE too much because Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have built up so much cachet with me. I'm giving the film 3.5 out of 5 stars because even though the film comes off low key and presents a series of weak spots, these two iconic actors still manage to shine like the stars they are... only, here, the wattage is set to lower than normal. Is it wrong to expect more out of these two?  I wasn't anticipating walking out of the film feeling that it was only okay.In a time of rampant downsizing, Larry Crowne never saw it coming. A veteran employee of the U-Mart supermarket, Larry is one of them happy, conscientious, efficient workers, having made Employee of the Month eight times. Except that Larry doesn't have a college degree, has never even gone to college, is expendable. The suits bluntly inform him that, without a college degree, Larry has no shot at upward mobility in U-Mart, and therefore there is no use in keeping him on. This is how Larry Crowne gets sacked.Tom Hanks ably exhibits the panic and dismay one experiences when you lose a job that you'd felt was so secure. And you emphatize with him more during this down moment, much more so than when he was merrily straightening out bits of sales items in the workplace or helpfully providing customer service. We get that sequence in which Larry Crowne applies for and gets rejected at various retail positions, and it's confirmed (in case you were wondering) that, yes, the job market really does suck right now. A depressed Larry gets advice from his perenially yard sale having neighbor (Cedric the Entertainer): ""Get you some knowledge and you'll be fire-proof."" And Larry hearkens. He hies himself to the East Valley Community College and enrolls in several self-improvement classes. Namely, Economics 1 (or ""Econ Prime"") and Speech 217 a.k.a. the Art of Informal Remarks.Here's Julia Roberts, looking a bit shopworn but that's a bit of character acting, I'm sure. She plays Mercedes ""Mercy"" Tainot, the prickly, disillusioned speech communications teacher, and it's made quickly apparent that she's one of them brittle wounded doves. Her husband is a tool who spends his time accessing them naughty web sites on the 'net, and there's a coolness between the couple. And maybe some of what's offputting about the film has to do with Julia going to that bitter well too often. There's a part of me that rails at Julia Roberts not being exuberant and lovable like in her other pictures. It's funny. We want our actors to branch out, to step out of their comfort zones. And yet when they do, sometimes, we blink. I'm just not used to seeing a Julia Roberts character that's this resentful.Gugu Mbatha-Raw, so lovely and whom I thought was very good as Sam Bloom in UNDERCOVERS, is like a breath of fresh air and she injects so much breezy energy into the story. She's Talia, a young free spirit who befriends Larry Crowne and gradually makes him over, nurtures his self-confidence, gives him a new name: ""Lance Corona."" Talia introduces him to her troop of scooter-riding enthusiasts, and I never thought there'd be room in cinema for scooter gangs as a sub-culture, but there it is. Talia jauntily tells Larry: ""A man on a scooter can accomplish anything, Lance."" However, I'll debate anyone to the death that there's something inherently cool about a middle-aged dude sporting those chain thingees hanging off his belt. But my point was - Gugu Mbatha-Raw is a breath of fresh air.If you're expecting an incisive, insightful look at our current recession, then you should double-check the marquee billing because this isn't UP IN THE AIR. What LARRY CROWNE does have is a story about a working schmoe like you and me trying to survive and finding out that going to college comes with its own rewards. And maybe that's what Tom Hanks is going for. No epic swerves, just a guy making do with his little triumphs. And that's not a bad message. There's even a scene here which demonstrates that strategic foreclosure doesn't have to be as embarassing as implied.The film doesn't give us a reason to invest in Larry's classmates in Speech 217. Rita Wilson's banker isn't enough in the film for her to matter. However, Wilmer Valderrama is enjoyable as the leader of the scooter gang who's juuuust a bit concerned that Larry Crowne is making too much time with his girl, Talia. George Takei has a choice bit as the economics professor who expects his students to laugh along at his jokes (except that they don't). LARRY CROWNE settles for the sweet and simple romantic comedy, except that I don't think the two leads invest enough scenes together, and so the romance comes off a bit abrupt to me. I think Hanks and Roberts were all too aware of their age and so played it safe, and so their thing comes off more like comfy pajamas than sexy negligee, if you get the metaphorical drift. When Tom and Julia finally lock lips, it's more of a slapstick wrestling match than anything. The pace doesn't snap, and it feels like there's something missing. LARRY CROWNE will do for a modest romantic comedy. Although it's great to see Hanks and Roberts plying their craft - and it's great to see them in the same movie and be still so likable (yes, Julia's character warms up) - it seems like it should've been more. But what do you expect? There's a recession on.",4,Larry Crowne goes from retail clerk to short order fry cook and feels better about himself,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,5348,"[""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'dump', 'LARRY',

One of the main real problems is that the theme of the movie is basically boring, a guy losing his work and trying to find a new one, however everything possible have been done to ""push up"" that idea, from the excellent actors to the quality of the writing who is really excellent. The acting of everybody is really really brilliant, seeing that is an eye candy... In my opinion technically it could be seen as one of the best directorial debut someone could have, but there's some flaws here and there... For one thing there's the title, it's sad to say but it's not a very popular name who inspire confidence or encourage peoples to go see the movie, I even believe many peoples didn't like it just because of that... Something like ""A Year In The Life Of Mr. Crowne"" would have sold the movie better... And there's the song ""Hold On Tight"" by Electric Light Orchestra who is played at the very beginning, it's a very entertaining song but not subtle at all (in my opinion one of the stupidest song of the 80s)... Also on the technical side the quality of the picture is really really horrible, cinematographer Philippe Rousselot usually does a really incredible work, I don't know what happened this time...

1461531,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B005HWAOHK,Joseph Haschka,"[0, 0]","LARRY CROWNE is a light romantic comedy - with considerable emphasis on ""light"" - starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts that continues a genre in which Tom's earlier films with Meg Ryan (Sleepless in SeattleandYou've Got Mail) were hits. Except that LARRY CROWNE isn't as good as those previous two. Perhaps it's the aging of the target audience, or that Roberts doesn't have quite the same chemistry with Hanks as Ryan did, or I'm just getting cantankerous.Here, Tom plays Larry Crowne, a forty-something employee of U-Mart fired because he hasn't a college education and has reached his ceiling with the company. Everything thus dumps on Larry at once: the needs for more education and a new job and the painful necessity to rid himself of a house on which he owes more than it's worth.To get the book learning, Crowne enrolls in a local community college. One of his classes teaches off-the-cuff speaking, and is taught by Mercedes Tainot (Roberts). Tainot is suffering both professional and husband burnout. Her spouse Dean (Bryan Cranston) is ostensibly a stay-at-home writer, but he spends his days viewing Internet soft-porn featuring busty babes. The last straw for Mercedes comes when his retort in a nasty verbal spat is that she's flat-chested. In the meantime, Larry, a former Navy commissaryman, i.e. cook, gets a gig as a short-order chef at a coffee shop.Both Larry and Mercedes each need to kick-start a new life. They're made for each other. Perhaps the best scene involving the two is when Mercedes asks Larry if he wants to kiss her. As it plays out, we realize the depths of their respective needs.While the movie is amusing, inoffensive and cute - and Roberts remains the eternal ""pretty woman"" - the problem for me was that it was too cute and improbable.A neighbor of Crowne's, Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer), apparently runs a 24/7 flea market in his front yard. Since it's a nice, middle-class neighborhood, in real life I'd have to believe the local homeowner's association would have a cease and desist order slapped on Lamar faster than he could say, ""For you, only ten bucks.""Also featured is a scooter gang (as opposed to a motorcycle gang), a member of which (Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Talia) works to bring out the inner Larry. A scooter gang? Really? How adorable is that?Perhaps the best role is played by George Takei (of TV'sStar Trek: Original TV Series [Blu-ray] as Economics professor Dr. Matsutami. He's weird and a bit creepy in an endearing sort of way; it's a nice spin on what might otherwise have been a ho-hum supporting effort.Of greater interest to me were the film's shooting locations, a couple of which were recognizable as being very local to my own residence.The ""U-Mart"" exterior shots were actually of a K-Mart on San Fernando Road in Burbank. Obviously, the signage was changed perhaps because the latter didn't want to be seen as the evil corporation capable of firing educational low achievers and/or giving lovable Tom Hank's in any guise the heave.The coffee shop that hired Larry was depicted as ""Frank's"", an eatery that really exists also in Burbank on Olive Avenue. In one scene, Mercedes occupies a booth consuming a meal just cooked-up by Crowne. So, the week after I saw the film, I stopped in for lunch. As I was the only customer, I was able to sit in the same booth in the exact spot as Julia Roberts. For a brief, giddy moment, I felt close to greatness and a chill went down my spine. (Well, perhaps it was the air conditioning after coming in out of upper-90s heat.) One of the waitresses, who was working Frank's in 2010 during the filming, was thrilled that she'd had a (very) small appearance in the final cut and that Hanks, who'd also directed, had taken to heart a couple of her suggestions as to how a coffee shop is actually run. You're a star, girl!The patty melt, by the way, was excellent.LARRY CROWNE is no more than a mediocre entertainment vehicle deserving three stars if one ignores the presence of the two showbiz titans in the cast. But, with Tom and Julia - both deservedly beloved by American (and international) filmgoers - one must elevate the flick to four stars. I mean, to do otherwise would be to similarly say that anything ordinary that Jimmy Stuart and Audrey Hepburn - I date myself here - might have appeared in together was marginal dross.

1461533,A8343K7CN8LT4,B005HWAOHK,J. Woolston,"[2, 5]","First off, the premise for the film is interesting and timely. Many people need college degrees to succeed in the work place or to even hold an entry level position. Larry needs schooling to get his life on track. He is unemployed and down on his luck. This is the most realistic part of the movie. Hanks is likable as Larry and Julia Roberts 'gets' the burned out community college teacher role to perfection.My problem with the film is that as a college professor, I am sick and tired of seeing these ""teachers fall for student"" movies. Sure, Larry is an older non-traditional student. In reality, this does not matter. A teacher who is romantic with a student could be fired or could face serious consequences in terms of professionalism. (I have had several male colleagues over the years become romantic with young female students and...real life or not..all of them are out of a job once their antics became well known). We are like doctors, psychologists, or any other highly educated field and a code of trust is in place. We never break that, and the folks who do are usually not good teachers.I would have liked this film more if Roberts inspired Hanks and left it there without the kissing or later relationship. Because THAT would be real. Also, the fact that Hanks makes friends easily (they try to make him 'cool' and invite him into their scooter gang) is also very unrealistic. Most college kids are foul mouthed, unmotivated, hate adults, and booze it up.On one hand, the fantasy element of this movie is off the charts. That can be refreshing in a depressing world...but also dangerous when people (esp kids) view this and think, ""this is how college is.""

That's a lot of roles, but he fills them all well in this movie.A feel good romantic comedy that reflects the current economic times we are facing. Poor Larry is downsized from his job, divorced, and has a bleak outlook for prospective jobs. He decides the best option is to enroll in a local college and complete a few courses. He begins simplifying his life, trading in fancy items like an SUV for a scooter to save on gas money. He makes several transitions from employed individual to college student but retains and utilizes his job skills along the way.Larry is guided towards speech and economics. As it turns out, his speech teacher is a fox (Julia Roberts) who has lost her knack for teaching. The economics professor was perhaps the biggest surprise, played by George Takei. They even give him a little nod when doing speeches as one of the students discusses Star Trek. Julia Robers makes the mistake of saying Star Wars which sends the speaker into a frenzy.

Plenty of mild humor, touching storyline, an everyman hero everyone wants to cheer on.Longer review...Tom Hanks is Larry Crowne.  Larry loves his job and excels at it. He's divorced, ex-military and comfortably settled into being alone but not lonely. Then, just when he thought he could live his life out in complacent bliss, he's called to a meeting with his boss. Thinking he's a shoe-in for his ninth round of employee of the month he is devastated to learn that not only is he not, he's out of a job.The solution to avoiding this same fate elsewhere is college...so he enrolls. There he meets a gang of scooter and motorcycle riding young adults who change his look and his life. And he encounters his speech teacher, Mercy (Julia Roberts). Mercy does not love her job and she does not love her life. She is married to a selfish man and embittered by students who don't care.There are moments of cheesiness in this film. Mercy lets out a tirade with an F-Bomb or two, and her husband is into buxom women and a few of bikini clad chest shots show up on his computer screen, other than that, the film is refreshingly clean. Larry Crowne's game-show-retiree, perpetual-garage-sale holding neighbors are possibly the best part of the movie.This is a light watch with some meaningful moments and entertainment.

She stars as Mercedes Tainot, a community college teacher in Southern California trapped in a loveless marriage to a writer of epic-sized fantasy novels like A GAME OF THRONES, only not very successful.  Mercedes feels used by her husband, and for some reason feels especially irked when it is revealed that he (Bryan Cranston, not bad in an underwritten part) is exposed as the type of buy who, as soon as Julia Roberts leaves the house, heads for the @sexchannels on his computer.  Like that's supposed to be a terrible crime against humanity.  Meanwhile Tom Hanks (we are not told but I assume he is pornfree) has become a student in Mercedes' public speaking class.  This part of the movie was very intriguing, for all to seldom do the movies show an actual class in operation from beginning to end, well, at any rate you get to learn something here.  I learned a lot about public speaking from Julia Roberts' sensible, no nonsense advice.She says that when you begin to speak, you should look up and directly confront the face of someone way to the left of you.  A few minutes later, raise your head from your notes once again, and address someone directly in front of you.  Then try swiveling your head to catch the attention of those on your right.  By the time you have done this, advises the Oscar-winning star, you will have made the whole room feel like they've just had a direct conversation with you--you will have gotten through to them.As in every other movie where the heroine has an unusual or bizarre name, I suspected an anagram right away.  Like the way the name of the heroine in THE TIME TRAVELLER'S WIFE anagrammed out to ""Isabel Archer,"" the heroine of Henry James' novel THE WINGS OF THE DOVE, I sat upon the name ""Mercedes Tainot"" wondering how to puzzle out its secrets.  It must have signified something to Tom Hanks, who wrote the serviceable screenplay as a vanity vehicle for himself.  But what?  I worked out a few anagrams, but do any of them really make sense as a ""Rosebud""-style revelation to the inner meaning of LARRY CROWNE?  There's ""Mister Anecdote,"" which I like, also, ""Comedian Tester,"" which would have been good in some other movie perhaps, not this one however.  Then there's ""Remote Distance,"" but to me that hardly describes the one and only Julia Roberts!

Larry Crowne is not a sizzling drama, a fast paced action movie, or an over-the-top comedy, & it's not likely to win a bunch of Oscars for acting, screenplay or anything else for that matter. What is is, however, is a well written, fun movie that is fairly well acted & very enjoyable.The story does take a little bit to unfold, but does so in an organic way as not to give away too much too soon. The cast was well chosen & I found the characters to have been well developed & really fun people. Like most other films, there is certainly some creative license taken in that most everybody in it is funny and likable, which is what you want from a film like this. If only reality were filled with such great people, we should all be so lucky.There are a few loose ends that may have been stitched up a bit better (per several of the reviews I have read) but I'm not sure that was necessary at all to the story. Moviegoers these days seem to have a need for everything to be spelled out to the Nth degree. If it wasn't critical for the story to unfold, it didn't make its way into the picture. There's something to be said for movies that leave a bit to the imagination for the viewer after the film is over, Keeps you thinking about it for awhile after you've left your seat.I would watch it again.

In fact, they really don't have much chemistry in this film, and it's not a great performance for either of them. They both fall into 'mugginess' at times, as in mugging for the camera, where they seem to overact, especially with facial expressions. And since in the end this is supposed to be about a slow-growing romance between the two of them, the fact that they don't have a ton of chemistry is a big problem.As for the plot, basically Larry Crowne (Hanks) has lost his managerial job at U-Mart because he doesn't have a college education, so he decides to downsize his life and go back to school. Julia Roberts plays a speech and communications professor at the local community college that he attends. Other characters in the movie include Roberts' no-good husband, and other students at the school, who befriend Hanks' character and give him a makeover of sorts.Roberts' character is pretty unlikeable, and so I didn't find myself rooting for them to get together, which is usually the point of a romantic comedy. The film is also pretty slow-paced - it is more of a meandering 'slice of life' kind of film, not an outright comedy (romantic or otherwise) with laugh-out-loud scenes. There are some fun characters that provide more laughs than Hanks and Roberts - a neighbor of Hank's, some friends in his class, an Economics professor, and a bank loan officer (played by Rita Wilson, Hank's wife in real life) - but overall, this isn't enough to save it from so-so status.",3,"Never Quite Takes Off, And Roberts and Hanks Can't Save It",1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,1581,"['film', 'never', 'quite', 'even', 'having', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'fact', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'chemistry', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'performance', 'fall', ""'mugginess"", 'times', 'mugging', 'camera', 'where', 'seem', 'overact', 'especially', 'facial', 'expressions', 'end', 'supposed', 'be', 'slow-growing', 'romance', 'two', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ton', 'chemistry', 'big', 'problem.As', 'plot', 'basically', 'Larry', 'Crowne', 'Hanks', 'lost', 'managerial', 'job', 'U-Mart', ""n't"", 'have', 'college', 'education', 'downsize', 'life', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'speech', 'communications', 'professor', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'Other', 'characters', 'movie', 'include', 'Roberts', 'no-good', 'husband', 'other', 'students', 'school', 'who', 'befriend', 'Hanks', 'character', 'give', 'makeover', 'sorts.Roberts', 'character', 'pretty', 'unlikeable', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'rooting', 'get', 'together', 'usually', 'point', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'film', 'also', 'pretty', 'slow-paced', 'more', 'meandering', ""'slice"", 'life', 'kind', 'film', 'not', 'outright', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'otherwise', 'laugh-out-loud', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'characters', 'provide', 'more', 'laughs', 'Hanks', 'Roberts', 'neighbor', 'Hank', 'friends', 'class', 'Economics', 'professor', 'bank', 'loan', 'officer', 'played', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Hank', 'wife', 'real', 'life', 'overall', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'so-so', 'status']",Larry Crowne

Now I admit to being biased as I really like Tom Hanks as an actor (and he can direct as well) -this movie is more proof of that.Hanks, as always, gives a great performance, Cedric the Entertainer, is as always, funny, the addition of Gugu Mbatha-Raw was a refreshing surprise: a not-so-well known actress as opposed to the usual parade of ""standard-issue"" Hollywood actresses, did a superb job. Bringing me to my next point: Julia Roberts. I really don't like her all that much and she is well... overrated? But, she did a great job playing her character though I think the focus was on her a bit more than I liked, just my opinion.The movie did have an air of over-optimism to it as I don't feel it was as realistic as could have been, everything was handled to cleanly, since as we all know real-life tends to get sticky -but again for pure entertainment purposes it had the right doses of reality and Hollywood ""reality"".

I've never seen a scooter ""gang"" (I live in Las Vegas) so I'm a bit suspicious of the ""agenda"" behind this train of thought. I can't imagine Hanks, Roberts or any other big Hollywood types using scooters as their main source of transportation -again my observation.Overall, this movie deserved more of a liking from critics, if you do like the ""light-romance""/comedy, start-over type of movies where everyone wins in the end, this is your flick.

There, he meets the usual mix of cool people and charming misfits, at the lead of whom is his Speech professor, played by a very unappealing Julia Roberts.I mean, I can see why she'd fall for him--especially considering her selfish, loser, one-dimensional husband, but what on earth does Larry see in her?  She's a bitter, selfish, nasty, drunken misanthrope, who looks awful and has all the appeal of biting into a rotten salmon.Well, I guess the script calls for it, that's why.Okay, so we have that, and if you can accept it, the movie isn't too bad.As for supporting characters, any movie with Pam Greer gets an extra star in my world.  (Why didn't Larry fall for her?  She looks great.)  George Takei has a hilarious supporting role as (of all things) an economic professor, who makes The Dismal Science more like The Eccentric Science.So, the movie isn't a total loss.All that aside, I couldn't help thinking how much better this movie might have been with a younger cast--say, people in their mid-30's as opposed to being more in the mid-life crisis range (which is my own age, by the way).Well, it is what it is, as people are fond of saying these days.

He is then faced to go to college for the first then ever.But, before Larry goes to college, he attempts to get a job. Larry calls other places for job openings, but to no luck. He then decides to go door to door to places and apply for work. As you may have guessed, Larry is pretty old and old fashion. I thought this part is pretty funny to watch because hardly anyone ever goes door to door applying to places anymore.  Now a days, email is the only choice and I won't be surprised if places tell people to apply online. Also, most places won't even give out their phone number to call them.  But, I understand why the movie showed Larry do those things. If we just saw Larry siting at his computer typing a cover that would be pretty boring to watch. Or, him sitting there thinking about what to write is the same thing...boring. So, making him drive around and going door to door makes a better movie. With no luck getting a job, Larry now goes to college.Making Larry drive around also goes into another point in the movie. Larry drives a huge gas guzzler and gas is so expansive! So, that makes Larry buy a scooter. The scooter actually helps Larry more than get around. He meets a sweet young girl named Tania and she is a student. Tania invite Larry into her bike gang or scooter gang.In school, Larry has a few classes. He has a Economic class and a communication class. The econ class teaches Larry how to be better with money and his finances. That helps him find a way to get out of his in debt house, which he thought he couldn't get out of. Larry has a communication class that supposed to teach him to communicate better. After a while, he slowly starts to fall in love with his teacher, Mercy"" Tainot, (Julia Roberts). However, Julia play a teacher that has loss her love in teaching and is married to a dead beat husband. She too starts to fall in love with Larry after she dumps her husband.  But, they can't really embrace their love for each other because she is a the teacher and he is her student.Only after Larry passes Tainot class, they can finally be together. This is the happy ending that the audience loves to see happen at the end. If it went any other way, then I would had hated this movie. There were a few things that I didn't write about that was also important in the movie, but I would rather have you see it then me write about it and spolier it for you. I do recommend this movie.

1461585,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B005HWAOHK,Steve,"[2, 6]","Perhaps the most perplexing thing about Larry Crowne is that it was made in the first place. My guess is this was the bone the studio threw to Hanks in exchange for signing some other deal. The point being, this is a tired format (middle age rediscovery) and it's been done before much better. Off the top of my head, I can think of Sideways and there are doubtless many more.The problems have to do with the lack of reality - as others have pointed out. There are financial holes in logic, e.g., the house Crowne lives in afforded on a bottom-rung retail gig unless we are to assume he did his time in the U.S. Navy and has a nice retirement. That's feasible, but it then doesn't describe why he feels the need for career insurance. Why not just find another retail job or keep the diner job since he's already got a solid retirement income? Also - why didn't he go to college while in the service?Continuing with the unanswered but necessary questions, why the acceptance of this middle aged guy into a hip scooter gang? What is it about Larry that makes him so appealing to everyone? Why didn't his marriage work? Where are the kids he envisioned having? What's his back story? There are simply too many questions without answer and plot contrivances to make me suspend disbelief and thus buy into the movie, not the least being Julie Roberts' weak and clich&eacute;d bad marriage that conveniently ends just in time for Hanks to show up and rescue her.This is the kind of movie that wants to make you happy but skimps on a script and goes straight for star appeal and conventionality. I understand every movie doesn't have to be gritty and realistic, but this is pure fluff without any heart at all. Having Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts go through the motions as, well, Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts characters, isn't enough to carry a movie. I'm usually a sucker for a decent rom-com or character study, but lacking in fully developed characters, Larry Crowne is neither.

1461586,A10C2SBALDLKU9,B005HWAOHK,Steven Carrier,"[3, 4]","""Larry Crowne"" was made under the most congenial of circumstances. The film seems to exist because Tom Hanks (star, director, co-writer) wanted to make a film with all his friends. This sense of amiability transcends to the screen making ""Larry Crowne"" one of the most effortlessly fluffy and charming romantic comedies in a long while. Unfortunately, the basic premise of the film, a man who is forced to redefine himself late in life due to job cutbacks, is *so* timely that the endless cheese-ball attitude nearly kills any sociological resonance. But do know that the film is so harmless, so light on it's feet, so family friendly that you can literally take anyone you know to go see it. Should we expect more edge from Hanks? Sure. But like I said, he's just in this for the fun and so should you. Julia Roberts is the real star of this film though, stealing every single scene with her sassy and lightly misanthropic attitude. ""Larry Crowne"" is far from being a bad film, but it is a disappointingly light one. Still, it works in it's favor because general audiences can do so much worse.

The comedy drama features two Oscar-winning players Tom Hanks (who also directs) and Julia Roberts.

Julia Roberts is disillusioned Mercedes Tainot teaching a speech class at a community college, where Larry enters thinking that getting a class there might help him get a new job.The interesting premise is wasted on a weak storytelling and script written by Hanks and Nia Vardalos of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" fame. Though outgoing Tom Hanks and cynical Julia Roberts share genuine chemistry, the film fails to provide them with a real story. No background for each character (except Mercedes's marriage that is falling apart), no character development, no plot. Things go too well.

Young Talia gives fifty-something Larry some advice on hairstyle, clothes and interior decorating, and helps him ""transform."" I am not sure if Larry really needs this transformation, but watching Tom Hanks and Gugu Mbatha-Raw is certainly fun.

I noticed they recalled almost every scene and every aspect of the film. I mean, come on... if it was that bad, I would not have stayed at the theater to be tortured any longer.The truth is that the film certainly isn't the same type of movie as many others that either Hanks or Roberts has starred in. However, it does take somewhat of an interesting turn off the beaten path for both actors as well as George Takei (Mr. Sulu of Star Trek fame) who proves in this film that he can still play a serious roll when confronted with the opportunity. The actors in this movie portray what I see as more realistic everyday people more like ourselves. Julia Roberts portrays a common middle-aged college teacher fresh off a crappy marriage... I repeat... 'COMMON'. She's not a famous star reporter or the subject of a hooker's dream... a rich guy sweeps her off her feet. Tom Hanks portrays a middle-age man who has lost his job, and eventually his home, and needs to go back to school in an attempt to improve his future. Again, just a fairly common guy... served a hitch in the Navy and has a knack for cooking... not some lone survivor stranded on a uninhabited island or a guy that falls in love with a mermaid.This is a lighthearted DRAMA, not a thriller, science fiction or fantasy movie.

1461605,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B005HWAOHK,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[6, 7]","Larry Crowne, directed by Tom Hanks, from a screenplay by Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) is not a deep movie, which is disappointing because it could have been. But that said, Hanks and Vardalos get a lot of the important stuff right and as a result Larry Crowne hits home in a lot of ways. The issues it touches on - job loss, divorce, worry about losing your house, having to start your life all over again both career-wise and romantically - are things that will connect and resonate with a lot of people these days.The title character, Larry Crowne (Tom Hanks) is a likeable guy who works hard at his job as a ""team leader"" at the local U-Mart where he's worked every day since doing 20 years in the Navy right out of high school. He enjoys his job, likes his co-workers who like him in return, and has been voted Employee-of-the-Month multiple times. And so it comes as a complete shock when he's summoned by the management who tell him that they're letting him go because he doesn't have a college degree. Which is disastrous news for Larry as his house is underwater mortgage-wise and finding a new job is proving nigh impossible. Encouraged by his next-door neighbor Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer), who's been running a perpetual yard-sale on his front lawn for the last ten years, Larry decides to go to the local college and get a degree that will, in Lamar's words ""make you fire-proof!"" One of the courses he ends up taking is a public-speaking course taught by Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts), a teacher who's suffering from burn-out in her job and disenchantment with her marriage. Predictably, and yet without succumbing to easy cliche, a cautious spark of romance begins to kindle between them as each begins to move beyond their set-backs and disappointments and towards re-starting their lives.There are a number of key scenes where the film really strikes a resonating chord with what a lot of people have either been through or going through in recent years. The early scene where Larry is being fired is priceless where the managers use convoluted corporate-speak language to make it sound like they're doing Larry a favor by firing him. Another scene is where Larry is at the bank trying to talk to them about his underwater mortgage and the same thing happens as they talk him into doing whatever he can to continue making payments even though there's no way he can sell the house or keep up with the payments, again using contorted bank-speak to make it sound like they're acting in his interests and not their own.The supporting cast is excellent and really helps keep things interesting with stand-out performances by Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Talia, a hurricane-on-wheels of irrepressible perkiness who takes charge of giving Larry a new look as well as a new set of friends, and manages to do a feng-shui makeover of his house in the process; Wilmer Valderamma as Del, Talia's frequently glowering and much put-upon boyfriend; Malcolm Barrett as Dave Mack, a student in the public speaking class who, against type, turns out to be a major Trekkie; and George Takei has a delightfully dry comic turn as the serenely self-important Dr. Matsutani who teaches Larry's Economics 101 class. And Cedric the Entertainer does another grand scene-stealing turn as Lamar, who lives to haggle with people at his never-ending yard sale.And in the why-is-that-face-or-voice-familiar? category: Grace Gummer who plays Natalie, one of Larry's fellow students, is in real-life the daughter of Meryl Streep, to whom she bears a striking resemblance; Rita Wilson, who plays the let-me-not-help-you bank rep Wilma Gammelgaard, is Tom Hanks' wife in real life; and Nia Vardalos supplies the voice of the annoying Map Genie GPS system in Mercedes' car.On the somewhat minus side however, Bryan Cranston, who was brilliant in TV's Malcolm in the Middle and Breaking Bad, doesn't seem to quite hit the mark as Mercedes' shiftless porn-addicted husband, Dean. And Pam Grier is largely wasted in her role as Frances, Mercedes' friend and fellow teacher.The one real drawback to Larry Crowne is that it never digs very deep, particularly on the emotional level, in spite of all the stressful life-changing events Larry and Mercedes are facing. Hanks' Larry, for example, _never_ gets angry, in spite of his being fired for inane reasons, having to face losing his house, etc. Neither does Roberts' Mercedes, no matter how much her husband lets her down or insults her. Annoyed or peeved is about as far as they go. Hanks and Vardalos, as director and writers, could have gone for more, given the things Larry and Mercedes must deal with in their personal lives, but they just keep things fairly light. Which is not bad exactly, as the film is enjoyable. But in the end, you're left with the feeling that they could have gone for more.Again, while Larry Crowne is not a terribly deep film, it does connect in a lot of ways, and I think a lot of people will relate to it. Recommended for anyone who wants to find something whimsically upbeat and hopeful about dealing with the things life can throw at you these days.",4,"Definitely on the light side, but hits home in a
