48176,A1WYEA9FBBSVHH,0783219806,"Joe Average ""Joe Average""","[7, 17]","Everybody raises their children differently but after watching this movie once with our two small children we've shelved it indefinitely. Maybe when the youngest is 10 years old we'll pull it out again.There were several things that made us cringe.One minor irritation was that they tried to throw characters of the 1920s and 1930s in a 1990s America. Kids don't talk like that anymore, don't dress like that anymore, and the divide between girls and boys has been shrinking - why reopen that???This should have been a period movie like ""Christmas Story"" and they should have removed the modern crude humor.What really bothers us about it though were the constant statements of hate, killing, murder and dying. Sure these are kids and those words don't mean as much coming from them as it does from an adult but these words should not be used so casually.Our fear was that our two young ones would begin to use language like that more often. No thanks. We'll be happier letting kids be kids without the suggestions of killing, murder, hate, etc.Our last problem was the sexual innuendo. There were several occasions that made us cringe. One was Alfalfa's hair suggesting an erection when he saw a cute girl. I'm fine with that sort of humor being aimed at teens but let's leave the cause and effect of an erection unspoken for really young kids - okay?The other was Alfalfa runing through the streets in jockey shorts (why not BOXERS?) and then losing them in the pool in front of Darla and the rich kid.Hmmm... I don't know how but a 1930s version of this situation would seem much more innocent than this movie did. Maybe it was the delay between the time he noticed he was naked and the amount of time it took him to be embarrased.In an old movie the character would have likely fled in terror behind something. In this movie all I could think of was a modern kid enjoying showing off his stuff. Yuck. Maybe in a Porky's style ""college"" movie - not in a movie for little kids. I prefer for our kids to be a little shy about who see's what.I see the original episodes are available on DVD. We will be purchasing those.Fun, innocent entertainment for little kids is very important to us. They grow up plenty fast without Hollywood's help. This movie is not part of the kind of entertainment we are ready to allow into our house for the kids.Parents watch this one without your children and judge for yourself.

Alfalfa, leader Spanky's best friend, has turned against them by having Darla be his girlfriend. When he invites her to the clubhouse for a secret date, it accidentally burns down. Not only does the club now have to worry about building a new one, it is also concerned with winning the go-kart derby race. And Alfalfa can only think of winning Darla back from rich kid Waldo who steals her away, even though he is on probation from seeing her.Thankfully, the film stays true to the characters and plots of the series, and even employs many of the same gags and situations, mainly from the later episodes. The He-Man Woman Haters Club comes from the short ""Hearts Are Thumps."" Also from this short is the bubble scene where Alfalfa consumes soap and sings out bubbles. The ""high sign"" comes from the short ""Anniversary Trouble."" The scene in which Spanky and Alfalfa dress in ballerina costumes to escape Butch and Woim is taken from ""Rushin' Ballet."" In ""Teacher's Beau,"" the kids sit on each other's shoulders and put on men's clothing and fake facial hair to appear older.

Universal Studios got the sound on the English and French tracks messed up. All the sound effects and music are in surround sound like they are supposed to be but the characters voices when they talk are supposed to be in the center but somehow they got put in the left channel and it drives me nuts. If Universal Studios did this on purpose, I don't understand what they were thinking. The DVD has the voices correctly placed in the center were the dialog is supposed to be but the blu-ray has the main dialog in the left channel only for the entire film. Because of this I cannot give the film five stars. I will try to contact Universal and ask them if this was done on purpose or if this is a glitch in the encoding of the sound on the blu-ray disc.
