She is another Michelle Yeoh. The movie revolving Donnie and Cynthia having to go to Hong Kong to retrieve a suspect in a murder case.  The lead detective also works for the CIA who is selling drugs to raise money for some of their other ventures and the suspect that Donnie and Cynthia are looking for happens to be a guy that was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  What this poor guy goes throughout this movie is something.  The lead detective and Donnie are partners and Donnie can't belive he is dirty until toward the end of the movie.

The story is trash anyway so it's useless to even spend any time caring who is who and why they want to kill eachother, so just watch the fights. Now the fights are decent, but the best part is the very end with Donnie Yen and the swoll cat he is fighting on the roof... one of the coolest fight scenes I have ever seen. This is a good add to your collection if you are a Donnie Yen fan, or have exhausted pretty much all the other good martial arts movies you can find.

784448,A1MBR816GYHY71,B0000V46DG,"Doc ""Dr. M. Anthony Collins, Ph.D., CIET""","[0, 1]","First, there are two major directors for this film; Martial Arts Directors Yuen Shun Yee, Wong Hun and Cho Wing and the principal director Yuen Woo Ping. The martial arts takes me back to one of Jackie Chan's movies i.e. Spartan X; then it leads to Police Story which are fair to pretty good. Now the poor issues are with story plot.  The actors pause and hesitate in several sectors of this movie, the story line makes the police (Donnie and Cynthia Khan) and the main character  (a dumb dock worker)  look very stupid  with poor decisions (not what you want to see in a Donnie Yen -Woo Ping movie).A captain of the police force (bad cop aka a spy in the C.I.A.) is the mastermind behind the terrorist and attempted murder schemes which get boring after you see them twenty times. The voice over's or dubbed work is poor also, in one scene they use a woman's voice to tell Khan to freeze; however behind the gun was a man.Here Yuen Ping takes no steals from the direction of movies he did and a ton from Jackie Chan; Proving that Ping is not really all that good-when he takes from others and recycles various action shoots like a bandit or a dog in heat",2,In The line of Duty 4,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1155,"['First', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'directors', 'film', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'Directors', 'Yuen', 'Shun', 'Yee', 'Wong', 'Hun', 'Cho', 'Wing', 'principal', 'director', 'Yuen', 'Woo', 'Ping', 'martial', 'arts', 'back', 'one', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movies', 'i.e', 'Spartan', 'X', 'then', 'Police', 'Story', 'are', 'fair', 'pretty', 'good', 'Now', 'poor', 'issues', 'are', 'story', 'plot', 'actors', 'pause', 'hesitate', 'several', 'sectors', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'police', 'Donnie', 'Cynthia', 'Khan', 'main', 'character', 'dumb', 'dock', 'worker', 'look', 'very', 'stupid', 'poor', 'decisions', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'Donnie', 'Yen', '-Woo', 'Ping', 'movie', 'captain', 'police', 'force', 'bad', 'cop', 'spy', 'C.I.A', 'mastermind', 'terrorist', 'attempted', 'murder', 'schemes', 'get', 'boring', 'see', 'twenty', 'times', 'voice', 'over', 'dubbed', 'work', 'poor', 'also', 'one', 'scene', 'use', 'woman', 'voice', 'tell', 'Khan', 'freeze', 'however', 'gun', 'was', 'man.Here', 'Yuen', 'Ping', 'steals', 'direction', 'movies', 'did', 'ton', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Proving', 'Ping', 'not', 'really', 'good-when', 'others', 'various', 'action', 'shoots', 'bandit', 'dog', 'heat']",N/A

It unfairly gives Cynthia Khan second place, when I would say she is really the main character (and her stunts are just as impressive as Donnie Yen's).

784452,APIW11UEPKIC2,B0000V46DG,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[1, 2]","This movie really gets started off with a bang.  It introduces woo-ping's little brother(yuen chat-yor?).  He can't really fight btu proves to VERY athletic.  Like when he kicks, he can kick VERY high.  He just doesn't have that great powerful movie style.  He is also the young fok yuen gap(bad translation)in my favorite movie ever, legend of a fighter, and he was perfect for that role until beardy replaced him later in the movie.  So the story really makes no sense.  Yuen Chat yor has to get away from these guys cause a cop who was just getting shot up, just sort of falls in to yuen's lap.  He dodges some bullets, gets away, and then is wanted for murder, but of course he didn't do it.I am nto going to continue to talk about the story cause it is starting to make me feel sick again.  But this movie is really only good for one thing, fastforwarding for the fight scenes.  Certainly not even freaking close to some of the best I have ever seen.  But they finally have a fight that last longer than 2 minutes at the end.  Though the fight makes absolutely no sense at all and the acting is certianly some of the worst I have ever seen, they do bring a minute or maybe even two minutes of excitement.  The black dude can go, he has definitely worked with donnie before, you can tell by how comfortable they are with eachother.  overall I saw 3 good fights and no other redeeming qualities from this movie.This dvd release by 20th century fox is in 5.1 sound for both chinese and american languages.  The american language is super cheesy but it is not going to exactly help the movie in a any way.
