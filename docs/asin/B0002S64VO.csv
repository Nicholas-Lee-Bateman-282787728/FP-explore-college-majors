Dave Matthews does a good job on his role, but it's really the kid who plays ""Billy"" and the 2 redbone dogs that make the movie for me. I love the movie, and it's one i can watch anytime. Kris Kristofferson narrates it and he has a small part in the beginning. He plays 'Billy' (when he is older). I only wish Dave Matthews would of done some music for the soundtrack. I really like him too, and it's nice to see him in a movie every now and then.A great movie to pick up and watch anytime.

844338,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B0002S64VO,C. Long,"[5, 5]","So here's the deal: As anyone who's read the book and seen the original movie knows, the original wasn't very good.  Oh, it was ""barely passable"" but never captured the book.  It was one movie that was BEGGING to be remade.  Well, it was.  And, as incredible as it is to believe, the remake is actually worse.That was some feat they pulled off.  I really don't understand how you could remake a movie like this and do it worse, but they managed to do so.  The updated movie is widescreen and looks a bit more modern.  That's about all it has going for it compared to the original.Here's my problems with it (in no particular order):- Pretty poor acting all the way around, but Billy's parents were the worst and neither the father or mother ""feel"" right for their part at all- No establishing of any ""feeling"" or ""connection"" between Billy and his dogs at all.  Considering this is a big part of the book, and at least attempted to be shown a little in the original movie, this is incredible that they could tell this story without doing this.- No establishing of any ""feeling"" or ""connection"" between any of the characters.- General ""wussification"" as I call it of life in general back then and Billy and his family specifically.  This movie lacks the ""ruggedness"" that even the original portrayed somewhat.  It's almost impossible to believe that THIS Billy Coleman could actually be skinning any raccoons given his demeanor in this new version.- The hunting supposedly takes place at night, but most all the scenes are in daylight...- The whole big scene with the boy dying flies so fast you can't even remotely tell what happened or experience much any feelings one way or the other in regards to it...- Musical interludes with styles that really take away from the scene you're supposed to be ""in""- General lack of any real engagement of feelings with the viewer.  I really wasn't the slightest bit moved by this version, whereas even the original managed to move me some!- Constant feeling that this movie was made on a ""shoestring budget"" even smaller than the original movie's was (and again, I'm sure that's saying something!)- The whole red fern reference they throw in at the very beginning of the movie in an awkward way.  At least in the original, it had a nice scene at the table where you were introduced to it.- I also downright didn't like the fact that they showed Billy ""crossing his heart and hoping to die"" that he would put the dogs out of his mind and a split second later they show him breaking that promise and running to go get his dogs.  I don't remember it that way in the book (though it's been a while since I read the book) or the original movie (which I watched recently) - it really teaches kids that their word means very little (i.e. it's okay to lie...)  For a family movie that tries to counter that message later on when it shows Billy KEEPING his word to his dogs, it just seemed really odd.  He can keep his word to his dogs, but not his mama???Anyway, all the above to say that this remake was a big disappointment.  If you're going to remake a movie like this because the original movie was outdated and not very good as compared to the book, shouldn't you at least TRY to make it better??  This fails on just near every front.  The magic of the book is nowhere to be found in this remake.  Not that was in abundance with the original movie either, but compared to this, the original movie looks like a masterpiece (even if it IS older looking!)Bottom line: The older original version of this movie, even with it's ""old"" look, does a better job of telling this story than this remake, and that's sad.  Unfortunately this book STILL is in need of a movie studio to come along and ""do it right"".",2,Worse than original and that's saying something...,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,3735,"['So', 'here', 'deal', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'original', 'movie', 'knows', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Oh', 'was', 'barely', 'passable', 'never', 'captured', 'book', 'was', 'one', 'movie', 'was', 'BEGGING', 'be', 'remade', 'Well', 'was', 'as', 'incredible', 'believe', 'remake', 'actually', 'worse.That', 'was', 'feat', 'pulled', 'off', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'could', 'remake', 'movie', 'do', 'worse', 'managed', 'do', 'so', 'updated', 'movie', 'widescreen', 'bit', 'more', 'modern', 'going', 'compared', 'original.Here', 'problems', 'particular', 'order', 'Pretty', 'poor', 'acting', 'way', 'Billy', 'parents', 'were', 'worst', 'father', 'mother', 'feel', 'right', 'part', 'all-', 'No', 'establishing', 'feeling', 'connection', 'Billy', 'dogs', 'Considering', 'big', 'part', 'book', 'least', 'attempted', 'be', 'shown', 'little', 'original', 'movie', 'incredible', 'could', 'tell', 'story', 'doing', 'this.-', 'No', 'establishing', 'feeling', 'connection', 'characters.-', 'General', 'wussification', 'call', 'life', 'general', 'back', 'then', 'Billy', 'family', 'specifically', 'movie', 'ruggedness', 'even', 'original', 'portrayed', 'somewhat', 'almost', 'impossible', 'believe', 'THIS', 'Billy', 'Coleman', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'skinning', 'raccoons', 'given', 'demeanor', 'new', 'version.-', 'hunting', 'supposedly', 'place', 'night', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'daylight', 'whole', 'big', 'scene', 'boy', 'dying', 'flies', 'so', 'fast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'experience', 'much', 'feelings', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'regards', 'Musical', 'interludes', 'styles', 'really', 'take', 'away', 'scene', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'General', 'lack', 'real', 'engagement', 'feelings', 'viewer', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'bit', 'moved', 'version', 'whereas', 'even', 'original', 'managed', 'move', 'Constant', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'even', 'smaller', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'saying', 'something', 'whole', 'red', 'fern', 'reference', 'throw', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'awkward', 'way', 'least', 'original', 'had', 'nice', 'scene', 'table', 'where', 'were', 'introduced', 'it.-', 'also', 'downright', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'showed', 'Billy', 'crossing', 'heart', 'hoping', 'die', 'would', 'put', 'dogs', 'mind', 'split', 'second', 'later', 'show', 'breaking', 'promise', 'running', 'go', 'get', 'dogs', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'way', 'book', 'been', 'while', 'read', 'book', 'original', 'movie', 'watched', 'recently', 'really', 'kids', 'word', 'very', 'little', 'i.e', 'okay', 'lie', 'family', 'movie', 'counter', 'message', 'later', 'when', 'Billy', 'KEEPING', 'word', 'dogs', 'just', 'seemed', 'really', 'odd', 'can', 'keep', 'word', 'dogs', 'not', 'mama', 'Anyway', 'above', 'say', 'remake', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', ""'re"", 'going', 'remake', 'movie', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'outdated', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'compared', 'book', 'should', ""n't"", 'least', 'TRY', 'make', 'better', 'just', 'front', 'magic', 'book', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'remake', 'Not', 'was', 'abundance', 'original', 'movie', 'compared', 'original', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'even', 'older', 'looking', 'Bottom', 'line', 'older', 'original', 'version', 'movie', 'even', 'old', 'look', 'better', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'remake', 'sad', 'Unfortunately', 'book', 'STILL', 'need', 'movie', 'studio', 'come', 'along', 'do', 'right']",N/A

844341,A57Q87B0TC9IJ,B0002S64VO,Derek G,"[6, 8]","I am probably rating this movie higher than I should be simply because I enjoyed the book.  Much of the timeless appeal of the story is missing from this updated adaptation, just as it was missing from the original 1974 movie.  It seems this movie spent more time attempting to do a recreation of the original movie than addressing its flaws.Reviewers have already mentioned the coon hunts being filmed in the daytime.  In addition, you never actually see any of the animals being caught or killed.  I realize this is a children's film, but at the same time these hats and pelts don't appear out of thin air.  Quite the opposite, these varmints are filmed in such a way it makes them look too cute to kill.  No screen time was devoted to the individual personalities of the two dogs and scenes where the dogs are in jeopardy look, well, fake.There are a number of instances where the acting and directing come off bad.  Dave Matthews does a fair job considering it's his first time in front of a camera.  Renee Faia is a cutie too.  Still, there are scenes where the acting didn't match the lines.  You could never really tell for sure whether the two wanted Billy to have the dogs, whether they were regretful the money was spent on dogs versus a mule, whether they really wanted to move to the city, etc...  One scene had Faia standing in the doorway, inviting two family friends for dinner, yet the look on her face made it seem this was the last thing she wanted.  Joseph Ashton does a fair job as young Billy Coleman, considering his age, and there is a solid chemistry between him and his grandfather (Dabney Coleman).  Unfortunately, at the heartwrenching moments of the movie, the points where the acting is pivotal, the emotion didn't carry through.I'm not sure Disney had much involvement in this picture other than a stamp on the cover and, most likely, distribution rights.  Perhaps someone will take another stab at this classic in less than thirty years -- and get it right.Hope the review helped.",3,Only a mediocre adaptation of a fantastic book,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,2011,"['am', 'probably', 'rating', 'movie', 'higher', 'should', 'be', 'simply', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'Much', 'timeless', 'appeal', 'story', 'missing', 'updated', 'adaptation', 'just', 'was', 'missing', 'original', '1974', 'movie', 'movie', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'attempting', 'do', 'recreation', 'original', 'movie', 'addressing', 'flaws.Reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'coon', 'hunts', 'being', 'filmed', 'daytime', 'addition', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'animals', 'being', 'caught', 'killed', 'realize', 'children', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'hats', 'pelts', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'thin', 'air', 'opposite', 'varmints', 'are', 'filmed', 'such', 'way', 'look', 'too', 'cute', 'kill', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'individual', 'personalities', 'two', 'dogs', 'scenes', 'where', 'dogs', 'are', 'jeopardy', 'look', 'well', 'are', 'number', 'instances', 'where', 'acting', 'directing', 'come', 'off', 'bad', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'fair', 'job', 'considering', 'first', 'time', 'front', 'camera', 'Renee', 'Faia', 'cutie', 'too', 'Still', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'lines', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'tell', 'sure', 'two', 'wanted', 'Billy', 'have', 'dogs', 'were', 'regretful', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'dogs', 'mule', 'really', 'wanted', 'move', 'city', 'etc', 'One', 'scene', 'had', 'Faia', 'standing', 'doorway', 'inviting', 'two', 'family', 'friends', 'dinner', 'look', 'face', 'made', 'seem', 'was', 'last', 'thing', 'wanted', 'Joseph', 'Ashton', 'fair', 'job', 'young', 'Billy', 'Coleman', 'considering', 'age', 'solid', 'chemistry', 'grandfather', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Unfortunately', 'heartwrenching', 'moments', 'movie', 'points', 'where', 'acting', 'pivotal', 'emotion', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'through.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Disney', 'had', 'much', 'involvement', 'picture', 'other', 'stamp', 'cover', 'most', 'likely', 'distribution', 'rights', 'Perhaps', 'someone', 'will', 'take', 'stab', 'classic', 'less', 'thirty', 'years', 'get', 'right.Hope', 'review', 'helped']",N/A

844347,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0002S64VO,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 6]","I liked this movie for several reasons, though I am unable to tell you that this movie is even above average.  This movie contains a solid flavor of the Midwest and the settings look very real and appropriate.  The dogs were appropriately charming and the scenes with the cougar were excellent.  I thought Joseph Ashton, Dabney Coleman and Ned Beatty all did a nice job in their roles.  Unfortunately, the script had weak moments and the movie was filled with singers pretending to be actors.We open this movie with a significantly older Billy Coleman (Kris Kristofferson) telling us about dogs and leading us into the depression in the Ozark region of Oklahoma.  Young Billy Coleman (Ashton) has a powerful desire to own coon dogs, and he works and saves until he has the money to buy a pair of coon dog pups.Brief aside:  Dave Matthews plays Will Coleman, Billy's dad, and Renee Faia plays Jenny Coleman, Billy's mom.  Unfortunately, several other actors in this movie, particularly the raccoons, the dogs and probably the cougar exceed the acting abilities of both singers.  Every time Jenny Coleman came on the screen I cringed (though she is quite pretty).  Dave Matthews should stick with singing rock music and avoid roles like this.Ignoring the fill-in parents, Billy has a lot of fun training his pups to be champion coon dogs, aided by Grandpa (Dabney Coleman) and tolerated by just about everyone else.  The next thing you know we have bets and competitions and run-ins with mysterious raccoons and the local neighborhood no-goods.  The heart of this movie will always be the dogs and the boy who loves them.  I am unable to say much more without giving away the ending, but I have to tell you that I was on the verge of tears at the end.This movie has lots of stuff going for it.  The animals are great, Joseph Ashton is a natural as Billy, Dabney Coleman and Ned Beatty know their stuff, and even Kris Kristofferson, who usually has the acting range of a fern, did a fine job.  The scene where a young boy dies is excellent, even if it was a bit shocking and disturbing.  The animal trainers really knew what they were doing and the scenes involving the animals were either charming or poignant.  The scenery in Oklahoma was excellent and reminded me again of how beautiful the Ozarks are.Unfortunately, many of the supporting actors did a lot of standing or had vague expressions on their face and made me wonder why they were even required in the movie at all.  Alternating between the more powerful performances in the film and the weaker performances was disconcerting at best, and disappointing at most.I still give this film a positive recommendation because the film captures the essence of Wilson Rawls's book.  I loved Joseph Ashton and his dogs.  I also enjoyed the extras, which included a making of feature showing Joseph Ashton talking with three of the animal trainers and hearing explanations of how some of the scenes were filmed.  Another feature featured an interview with Wilson Rawls's widow Sophie along with local residents in Oklahoma and cast members.Enjoy!",3,Fair Remake,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,3094,"['liked', 'movie', 'several', 'reasons', 'am', 'unable', 'tell', 'movie', 'even', 'above', 'average', 'movie', 'solid', 'flavor', 'Midwest', 'settings', 'look', 'very', 'real', 'appropriate', 'dogs', 'were', 'appropriately', 'charming', 'scenes', 'cougar', 'were', 'excellent', 'thought', 'Joseph', 'Ashton', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'roles', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'had', 'weak', 'moments', 'movie', 'was', 'filled', 'singers', 'pretending', 'be', 'actors.We', 'open', 'movie', 'significantly', 'older', 'Billy', 'Coleman', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'telling', 'dogs', 'leading', 'depression', 'Ozark', 'region', 'Oklahoma', 'Young', 'Billy', 'Coleman', 'Ashton', 'powerful', 'desire', 'own', 'coon', 'dogs', 'money', 'buy', 'pair', 'coon', 'dog', 'pups.Brief', 'aside', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'plays', 'Will', 'Coleman', 'Billy', 'dad', 'Renee', 'Faia', 'Jenny', 'Coleman', 'Billy', 'mom', 'Unfortunately', 'several', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'particularly', 'raccoons', 'dogs', 'probably', 'cougar', 'exceed', 'acting', 'abilities', 'singers', 'time', 'Jenny', 'Coleman', 'came', 'screen', 'cringed', 'quite', 'pretty', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'should', 'stick', 'singing', 'rock', 'music', 'avoid', 'roles', 'this.Ignoring', 'fill-in', 'parents', 'Billy', 'lot', 'fun', 'training', 'pups', 'be', 'champion', 'coon', 'dogs', 'aided', 'Grandpa', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'tolerated', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'have', 'bets', 'competitions', 'run-ins', 'mysterious', 'raccoons', 'local', 'neighborhood', 'no-goods', 'heart', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'dogs', 'boy', 'who', 'am', 'unable', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'giving', 'away', 'ending', 'have', 'tell', 'was', 'verge', 'tears', 'end.This', 'movie', 'lots', 'stuff', 'going', 'animals', 'are', 'great', 'Joseph', 'Ashton', 'natural', 'Billy', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'know', 'stuff', 'even', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'who', 'usually', 'acting', 'range', 'fern', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'dies', 'excellent', 'even', 'was', 'bit', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'animal', 'trainers', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'scenes', 'involving', 'animals', 'were', 'either', 'charming', 'poignant', 'scenery', 'Oklahoma', 'was', 'excellent', 'reminded', 'again', 'how', 'beautiful', 'Ozarks', 'are.Unfortunately', 'many', 'supporting', 'actors', 'did', 'lot', 'standing', 'had', 'vague', 'expressions', 'face', 'made', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'even', 'required', 'movie', 'Alternating', 'more', 'powerful', 'performances', 'film', 'weaker', 'performances', 'was', 'disconcerting', 'best', 'disappointing', 'most.I', 'still', 'give', 'film', 'positive', 'recommendation', 'film', 'essence', 'Wilson', 'Rawls', 'book', 'loved', 'Joseph', 'Ashton', 'dogs', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'extras', 'included', 'making', 'feature', 'showing', 'Joseph', 'Ashton', 'talking', 'three', 'animal', 'trainers', 'hearing', 'explanations', 'how', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'feature', 'featured', 'interview', 'Wilson', 'Rawls', 'widow', 'Sophie', 'local', 'residents', 'Oklahoma', 'cast', 'members.Enjoy']",N/A

This movie could be a case study in how NOT to adapt a much-beloved novel! First, it is obviously fairly low-budget. They must have spent most of their money on paying Ned Beatty, Dabney Coleman and Dave Matthews. This left precious little cash for other things, like re-shoots. It just seems like anyone with half a brain looking at the dailies (what was shot that day), would have to realize that certain key scenes just didn't work and needed to be re-done. Like the instance when the neighbor boy falls on his ax and is killed. I don't expect graphic blood and gore. I would expect some emotional intensity. A better director would have been able to communicate the horror of such a situation without having to resort to nightmare-inducing visuals. But what this movie delivers is some sort of barely coherent scene that is really dependent on someone having read the book even to be able to understand what had happened.The same is true with many other key points in the plot, including the sad deaths of the dogs. This movie phones it in. Unbelievable.Like almost all films that try to deal with rural life, either in the present or in the past, this one completely fails to create a realistic, believable world. These people had a hard life. What did they do? Heck, we don't know. Dave Matthews lingers around the yard a lot, in spotless overalls and a hat completely sweat-stain-free. The kid has a bicycle, which is absurd, considering that the family couldn't even buy him shoes.The actress playing the mother is bad, bad, bad. She does look a little Native American, but not like someone from the 1920s or '30s. She appears to have just left a mall in Orange County, CA. The actor playing Billy is OK, given what he has to work with. Most of the blame has to be with the script and the direction.Live-action family movies are becoming more and more rare. And honestly, if they are going to be like this, they should become extinct.One more thing: If you're going to include the scene where Billy cuts down the big sycamore, and you're going to have the script say that it is a sycamore -- for Pete's sake, use a sycamore for the scene!

Lane,"[4, 5]","Billy Coleman's dream is to have 'coon hounds, but his family is too poor to buy them for him, so he works hard to earn the money himself, and in so doing finds out what his Grandpa meant by ""meeting God halfway"". Old Dan and Little Anne are two Red Bone coonhounds, the incarnation of his childhood dream . . . and, as it turns out, the answere to his mother's prayers that God would take their family to a place where her childred could go to school, and to church, and build themselves a future. Billy is a good kid, and this movie is something the whole family can watch together and enjoy. To families with small children, I would reccomend this new version by Walt Disney over the older version. There is a sad part where a boy named Rubin falls on a hunting axe and dies, and another part where a Puma fights with Old Dan and injures him. In this newer version, these parts are soft-soaped, whereas in the older version, they can really freak you out. To adults and older children, I would reccomend the older version. The story just draws you in in a way this new one doesn't. The charactors have more depth, and the acting is convincing in such a way as to make you forget it IS acting. How interesting that even some of the kids who reviewed this movie seemed to notice the false note, and the dependancy on hill-billy music to achieve a feeling of authenticity . . .

844353,A3EAU736LWTDCE,B0002S64VO,sinisterfiend666,"[8, 15]","A good, but a flawed movie. It moves way faster than the book, not that this is a bad thing, but a good chunk of the book is spent on the tedious tasks the boy goes through to earn money to buy his dogs.  The books is a little slow to the punch. The movie rushes right through to the point of the boy buying the dogs. This is probably good from a movie stand point, because you would probably get bored. However, by them not developing the time the boy spent earning money and practically ""obsessing"" with owning these dog, I think it took away from the emotions of the movie a bit. It almost seems like a fly by night idea this boy has to own a dog when in fact the book shows how long he desperately wanted these dogs. Next, the mother is a terrible actress, and the other actors are either above average, or just ""o.k"" Not having the best actors in the world took away some of the seriousness of the movie just a little bit. Next, I know this is nit picking, but, come on how clean are these farmers? If you watch the movie you will notice they are all very clean, bathed, have new cloths with no rips, work hard, never sweat or have dirt on them. At least in the old ""little house on the prairie"" series they would muddy the actors up and sweat them up (if you will) to look like they worked off the land. This aspect made the movie seem a little fake to me. Finally, I must restate, I did think this was a very good movie, probably the closes your going to get to the book. HOWEVER I have one major complaint about it that annoyed me to no end. It is the fact that Disney got their hands on this and made it into a movie. In doing so, they censored out the violence which made for some bad editing that was absolutely ridiculous. Yea, yea, I know the movie is for kids, but come on, this is a movie about hunting! You will only see one gun fire in the whole movie (and that is because it represented the start of a race) other than this, you watch the dogs corner a raccoon just to guess how they got it down from the tree. In one scene, the boy cuts a tree down to get to the coon. After that you begin to wonder if he cuts down every tree because they never show him using a gun. I read this book a long time ago, but I swore the boy had a gun. In keeping with the same complaint: the hatchet scene was so badly edited in order to hide the violence. I actually had to rewind the movie to see what happened. I said out loud, ""what just happened?"" I had to do a second take that it was so bad. still keeping on the same complaint: the mnt. Lion fight was cheesy and generic. All you see is a stupid trained cat swatting at a camera, then a scene with a fake coat (representing a dog) in its mouth. I have seen better FX in a b-horror movie. I just have one thing to say to Disney:  ""Old Yeller"" remember? A movie where a kid had a gun, they showed the gun being fired, and they showed the dog really fighting the local wildlife?
