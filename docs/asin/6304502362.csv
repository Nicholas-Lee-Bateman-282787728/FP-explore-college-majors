Once you think you get a funny comedy, it turns and has some serious and dramatic moments. It's an intriguing movie. Brooks stars as a science fiction writer who moves back in with his mom, played superbly by Debbie Reynolds, to help him understand his problem with women. What happens is an interesting premise where mom and son reveal secrets and feelings. Sometimes funny, okay, hysterically funny, and often tender and serious, this is one great achievement for Albert Brooks, who also wrote the film. It's also a great moment for Debbie Reynolds. This is the greatest thing to of happened in her career. Rob Morrow o-stars as the younger brother who can't seem to grip the whole odd situation. Lisa Kudrow has a very brief role as a bad date Albert goes on. This is one incredibly crafted movie with a great, intelligently written script.

426764,A7NBCYVPM10U7,6304502362,Bill Jones,"[1, 2]","Albert Brooks, in my opinion, has not made a bad film (a claim that not even Ingmar Bergman can make).  He continues that streak with &quot;Mother&quot;, a movie you should not miss.  (Note: I have not yet  seen &quot;The Muse&quot;.)In all his films, Brooks plays a character  who doesn't quite know himself.  Here, he plays a twice-divorced writer who  questions why his relationships with women never seem to work.  As a bold  experiment he decides to move back in with his mother (played by Debbie  Reynolds) to see if he can find some answers.  The premise is filled with  comic possibilities, and Brooks mines some of them.  There's a giddy  excitement when Brooks tells his disbelieving brother of his plan.  And  there's a terrific scene where he redecorates his room as it existed in the  70's, complete with &quot;Barbarella&quot; and Jimi Hendrix posters.But  the video is not merely silly.  There's a very serious undercurrent as  Brooks finds out why his mom has always seemed more critical of him than  his brother.  And why he has gravitated towards the wrong  women.&quot;Mother&quot; is well writter by Brooks and co-writer Monica  Johnson (they shared the Best Screenplay Award from the prestigious New  York Film Critics).  Part of why I think I like this film so much is  mother/son relationships are hardly rare and yet (for some reason) there  doesn't seem to be a lot of films about them.",3,"Not my favorite Brooks, but still worth seeing",956275200,"04 21, 2000",2000,1411,"['Albert', 'Brooks', 'opinion', 'not', 'made', 'bad', 'film', 'claim', 'not', 'even', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'can', 'make', 'streak', 'quot', 'Mother', 'quot', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'Note', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'quot', 'Muse', 'quot', 'films', 'Brooks', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'Here', 'twice-divorced', 'writer', 'who', 'questions', 'why', 'relationships', 'women', 'never', 'seem', 'work', 'bold', 'experiment', 'move', 'back', 'mother', 'played', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'see', 'can', 'find', 'answers', 'premise', 'filled', 'comic', 'possibilities', 'Brooks', 'giddy', 'excitement', 'when', 'Brooks', 'disbelieving', 'brother', 'plan', 'terrific', 'scene', 'where', 'room', 'existed', '70', 'complete', 'quot', 'Barbarella', 'quot', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'posters.But', 'video', 'not', 'merely', 'silly', 'very', 'serious', 'undercurrent', 'Brooks', 'out', 'why', 'mom', 'always', 'seemed', 'more', 'critical', 'brother', 'why', 'gravitated', 'wrong', 'women.', 'quot', 'Mother', 'quot', 'well', 'writter', 'Brooks', 'co-writer', 'Monica', 'Johnson', 'shared', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Award', 'prestigious', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Part', 'why', 'think', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'mother/son', 'relationships', 'are', 'hardly', 'rare', 'yet', 'reason', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'lot', 'films']",Mother VHS
426765,A1QDQT0ZAAZHQS,6304502362,BookMania,"[5, 22]","Every movie has a target age demographic and audience, and I think I might have been too young to fully appreciate this kind of movie.  There's nothing in here that I was too young to see or comprehend, but perhaps I was too young to relate and identify, and so I didn't find this movie as entertaining as I would have liked.This movie is about a middle-aged writer named John (Albert Brooks) who has just finalized his second divorce and decides his problems with women might be rooted in his childhood relationship with his mother (Debbie Reynolds).  He travels from his house in Los Angeles to his childhood home in Sausalito and moves back in with her in order to reconstruct the past and see exactly where things went wrong in their relationship.  There's a rather amusing running joke about how they're comically mismatched, especially when it comes to their choices in food.  This living situation goes on for a few weeks until John discovers an old hat box in the closet containing some old short stories that his mother had written before he was born.  John realizes that his mother used to be a very gifted writer, and he wonders if his sullen relationship with her has anything to do with the fact that she had to stop writing in order to raise a family.The movie is a comedy, and while there are some light chuckles here and there, there aren't enough.  The story seems to linger on until the last five minutes, where everything is hastily resolved.  Albert Brooks has always been a solid B-level actor, and that's exactly what he is in this anemic performance.  There's probably a reason why this is Debbie Reynolds' first leading role in almost 30 years, and it might have to do with the fact that she's not much of an actress, herself.  I never got the feeling that she was really acting, but instead, just delivering the lines written in the movie's script.  Rob Morrow gives a solid performance as Jeff, John's younger and more successful sibling who relies heavily on his mother's praise and approval.You might like this movie if you're over the age of 40, but if you're any younger than that, find something else to watch.",3,You Might Like It If You're Over The Age Of 40,1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,2141,"['movie', 'target', 'age', 'demographic', 'audience', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'young', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'kind', 'movie', 'nothing', 'here', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'see', 'comprehend', 'perhaps', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'relate', 'identify', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'as', 'entertaining', 'would', 'have', 'liked.This', 'movie', 'middle-aged', 'writer', 'named', 'John', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'who', 'just', 'finalized', 'second', 'divorce', 'problems', 'women', 'might', 'be', 'rooted', 'childhood', 'relationship', 'mother', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'house', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'childhood', 'home', 'Sausalito', 'moves', 'back', 'order', 'reconstruct', 'past', 'see', 'exactly', 'where', 'things', 'went', 'wrong', 'relationship', 'rather', 'amusing', 'running', 'joke', 'how', ""'re"", 'comically', 'mismatched', 'especially', 'when', 'choices', 'food', 'living', 'situation', 'few', 'weeks', 'John', 'old', 'hat', 'box', 'closet', 'containing', 'old', 'short', 'stories', 'mother', 'had', 'written', 'was', 'born', 'John', 'mother', 'used', 'be', 'very', 'gifted', 'writer', 'sullen', 'relationship', 'anything', 'do', 'fact', 'had', 'stop', 'writing', 'order', 'raise', 'family.The', 'movie', 'comedy', 'are', 'light', 'chuckles', 'here', 'there', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'story', 'linger', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'where', 'everything', 'hastily', 'resolved', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'always', 'been', 'solid', 'B-level', 'actor', 'exactly', 'what', 'anemic', 'performance', 'probably', 'reason', 'why', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'first', 'leading', 'role', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'might', 'have', 'do', 'fact', 'not', 'much', 'actress', 'never', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'really', 'acting', 'instead', 'just', 'delivering', 'lines', 'written', 'movie', 'script', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'solid', 'performance', 'Jeff', 'John', 'younger', 'more', 'successful', 'sibling', 'who', 'heavily', 'mother', 'praise', 'approval.You', 'might', 'like', 'movie', ""'re"", 'age', '40', ""'re"", 'younger', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'watch']",Mother VHS

426770,A23JNLBAE18XO0,6304502362,Frank R. Schoonover,"[1, 1]","Mother, a 1996 film by Albert Brooks, who also stars in this film, is another winner by him. This comedic and dramatic tale about a son moving back in with his mother is a wonderful film from start to finish. It also shows that there are still some great filmmakers in the good old USA. Brooks directed and co-wrote the script with Monica McGowan Johnson(may she rest in peace).The whole things starts with John Henderson(Brooks), a successful science fiction writer, who is going through his second divorce. He decides to move back in with his mother Beatrice(Debbie Reynolds)and decides to re-occupy the same room that he had when he was a child. John does this in hopes that by repairing the somewhat broken relationship that he had with his mother, he can also have better success with women. Soon, as John is settled in, he starts to make himself at home and helps his mother out whenever she needs it. The only problem is that it is causing some strains in her own personal life, especially where her relationships with other men are concerned. Plus, John can't seem to understand that his mother has since changed her lifestyle around starting from when he initially moved out. Also, he is soon in competition with his brother Jeff(Rob Morrow)for mother's affections as Beatrice is now reliving those days when both of these sons of hers were living in the house when they were still real young. Later on, while doing some checking around, John finds some old writings of hers that she did many years ago and reads them and thinks that they are really great. John soon discovers that this is why he feels that his mother hates him, though he does later learn that he is wrong in this assumption. Of course, his mother doesn't like him going through her personal things and such, but she doesn't really seem too mad about it with him. As usual, I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen this wonderful film as of yet.Mother became Brooks' highest grossing film to date. It made 19.1 million dollars at the box office. Like many of Brooks' previous films, it was also well received by critics. This is Brooks' best film to date. Brooks again really works wonders in front of and behind the camera. Mother is funny, poignant, bittersweet and has a lot of heart and soul. The film is very enjoyable and entertaining from start to finish. Mother is a rare film treat that can be enjoyed again and again without it ever getting dull or too boring. The chemistry between Brooks and Reynolds is really overwhelming and it works on all levels. They do make a wonderful team together as mother and son and that chemistry is what keeps the film alive and kicking.Originally, Albert Brooks wanted former US First Lady Nancy Reagan to portray the title character and she was contemplating coming out of retirement to portray the title character, but later had to back out as a result of her husband, former USA President Ronald Reagan, being sick and suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. Brooks also offered the role to Kathryn Grayson, but she turned it down thinking that the title character was, in her humble opinion, brain dead. Doris Day was also offered the title role, but she also turned it down. Nancy Reagen recommended her close friend Debbie Reynolds for the role and after Brooks talked with Reynolds' daughter Carrie Fisher, Carrie brought the script to her mother and she agreed to play the role. Debbie Reynolds was nominated for a Golden Globe award for ""Best Performance by an actress in a Motion Picture Comedy/Musical"" but won a Golden Satellite Award for the same category. Mother did win awards for it's script, which were the NFSC and NYFCC Awards respectively.I watched this film with my mother on Mother's Day 2012 and my mother enjoyed the film very much as much as I did. I advise all of you kids out there to watch this film with your mother any time that you wish. I hope that you and your mother enjoy this film as much as my mother and I did.Update: My mother died on September 21st, 2012 of cancer. May she always rest in peace. Whenever I decide to watch this film again, it will bring back the wonderful memory we had of her enjoying this movie.Overall, Mother is Brooks' best film to date and a film that still remains as wonderful no matter how many times that it is watched. It is also a very entertaining film by the one and only Albert Brooks. If you are a fan of Brooks' films like I am, this film should be in your DVD library. It is enjoyable from start to finish and never gets dull.",5,Another Winner From Albert Brooks And His Best Film To Date,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,4560,"['Mother', '1996', 'film', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'winner', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'tale', 'son', 'moving', 'back', 'mother', 'wonderful', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'also', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'filmmakers', 'good', 'old', 'USA', 'Brooks', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Monica', 'McGowan', 'Johnson', 'may', 'rest', 'peace', '.The', 'whole', 'things', 'John', 'Henderson', 'Brooks', 'successful', 'science', 'fiction', 'writer', 'who', 'going', 'second', 'divorce', 'move', 'back', 'mother', 'Beatrice', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 're-occupy', 'same', 'room', 'had', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'John', 'hopes', 'repairing', 'somewhat', 'broken', 'relationship', 'had', 'mother', 'can', 'also', 'have', 'better', 'success', 'women', 'Soon', 'John', 'settled', 'make', 'home', 'mother', 'out', 'only', 'problem', 'causing', 'strains', 'own', 'personal', 'life', 'especially', 'where', 'relationships', 'other', 'men', 'are', 'concerned', 'John', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'mother', 'changed', 'lifestyle', 'starting', 'when', 'initially', 'moved', 'out', 'Also', 'soon', 'competition', 'brother', 'Jeff', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'mother', 'affections', 'Beatrice', 'now', 'reliving', 'days', 'when', 'sons', 'hers', 'were', 'living', 'house', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'real', 'young', 'Later', 'doing', 'checking', 'around', 'John', 'old', 'writings', 'hers', 'did', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'reads', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'John', 'soon', 'why', 'mother', 'later', 'learn', 'wrong', 'assumption', 'course', 'mother', ""n't"", 'like', 'going', 'personal', 'things', 'such', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'too', 'mad', 'usual', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'wonderful', 'film', 'yet.Mother', 'became', 'Brooks', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'date', 'made', '19.1', 'million', 'dollars', 'box', 'office', 'many', 'Brooks', 'previous', 'films', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'received', 'critics', 'Brooks', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'Brooks', 'again', 'really', 'wonders', 'front', 'camera', 'Mother', 'funny', 'poignant', 'bittersweet', 'lot', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'start', 'finish', 'Mother', 'rare', 'film', 'treat', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'again', 'again', 'ever', 'getting', 'dull', 'too', 'boring', 'chemistry', 'Brooks', 'Reynolds', 'really', 'overwhelming', 'levels', 'do', 'make', 'wonderful', 'team', 'together', 'mother', 'son', 'chemistry', 'what', 'film', 'alive', 'kicking.Originally', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'wanted', 'former', 'US', 'First', 'Lady', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'portray', 'title', 'character', 'was', 'contemplating', 'coming', 'retirement', 'portray', 'title', 'character', 'later', 'had', 'back', 'out', 'result', 'husband', 'former', 'USA', 'President', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'being', 'sick', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'Brooks', 'also', 'offered', 'role', 'Kathryn', 'Grayson', 'turned', 'down', 'thinking', 'title', 'character', 'was', 'humble', 'opinion', 'brain', 'dead', 'Doris', 'Day', 'was', 'also', 'offered', 'title', 'role', 'also', 'turned', 'down', 'Nancy', 'Reagen', 'recommended', 'close', 'friend', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'role', 'Brooks', 'talked', 'Reynolds', 'daughter', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'Carrie', 'brought', 'script', 'mother', 'agreed', 'play', 'role', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'award', 'Best', 'Performance', 'actress', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Comedy/Musical', 'won', 'Golden', 'Satellite', 'Award', 'same', 'category', 'did', 'win', 'awards', 'script', 'were', 'NFSC', 'NYFCC', 'Awards', 'respectively.I', 'watched', 'film', 'mother', 'Mother', 'Day', '2012', 'mother', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'advise', 'kids', 'out', 'there', 'watch', 'film', 'mother', 'time', 'wish', 'hope', 'mother', 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'mother', 'did.Update', 'mother', 'died', 'September', '21st', '2012', 'cancer', 'May', 'always', 'rest', 'peace', 'Whenever', 'decide', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'wonderful', 'memory', 'had', 'enjoying', 'movie.Overall', 'Mother', 'Brooks', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'film', 'still', 'wonderful', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watched', 'also', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'are', 'fan', 'Brooks', 'films', 'am', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'DVD', 'library', 'enjoyable', 'start', 'finish', 'never', 'dull']",Mother VHS

Surprise! Albert Brooks film is neither.  In fact, Brooks' specialty seems to be taking potentially weighty themes and making smart, but still lighter-than-air films on them.  What DEFENDING YOUR LIFE did for the afterlife, MOTHER does for family relations.  And that's a good thing.Brooks has a deft, understated comic flair.  You chuckle more often than you laugh out loud.  Contrary to what others have posted below, Debbie Reynolds ""Mother"" character is not a black and white character at all.  She's as conflicted and complicated--and as it turns out, just as smart--as her neurotic son(s).  That's the beauty part.  Brooks allows all his characters their humanity.  He doesn't oversimplify things (frustrated son vs. castrating mother).  Mother had her own issues--dating back to her own childhood and adolescence. Brooks' writer character John finally makes that realization and, in a very real sense, it proves liberating for him.  But that almost makes MOTHER sound like more of a ""message movie"" than it ever was intended to be.  In the end, MOTHER makes a gentle plea for self-realization for all.  But that message just kind of sneaks up on you.

426794,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,6304502362,Thomas Glebe,"[1, 1]","For the record, I have always been an Albert Brooks fan.  In fact, I really can't think of a film he's either written, directed, did both, and/or acted in that I haven't either really liked or just outright loved a whole lot.  ""Mother"" is no exception, and in fact, this little known, probably rarely seen work of his, is one of my all time favorites of his as well.  Which is a shame sort of, because this is at times, one of his most accessible endeavors.I first saw this on cable or rented it as I recall, in the late 90's, after I reluctantly moved back from Los Angeles (Adventureland) to my old hometown (Pittsburghland), to try to help play ""caregiver"" to my own aging mom.  Seeing freshly this glorious but subtle flick several times since on HBO, and quickly burning it to DVD accordingly for future gratifications, having only recently losing my own mother after a nearly decade-long bout with Alzheimer's, my appreciation for this work has only grown.  Albert Brooks has given us many great films over times, but this is among his finest (if lesser known achievements).  For it touches upon universally common experiences and instances almost all of us can relate to, any or most of us who had mothers whom despite all their flaws, we essentially loved unquestionably, and mothers who as well, despite all of our own flaws, loved us as well, virtually unconditionally.While the characters dealt with here I find hard to relate to in their financial and upper strata positions in life, the whole point of this is to reflect upon ""Mother.""  That is, most of our detailed experiences of dealing with our own, and regardless of social status or class, it is without question, simply the best title this movie could have.  Because unless we've had some weird and unusual relationship(s) with the woman who gave us birth, there are many, many circumstances dealt with here, which should be familiar, poignant, and lovingly amusing to most of us.  I saw a LOT of my own dearly departed mum's traits and characters in Debbie Reynolds, who came out of Hollywood film retirement here to brilliantly play Albert Brooks' mother, and I'm sure my experience as such, should be shared by many viewers, if not most.In this Albert Brooks film jewel, he plays a rather neurotic, aging 30's-40's something, modestly successful LA sci-fi book author, divorced for the second time, who comes to a point in his life where he deeply questions why exactly he has seemed to miserably fail in romantic relationships with women in general, and with his ex-wives in particular.  After a quick low point, a hilarious and disastrous blind-date with a beautiful but air-headed girl (played effectively by Lisa ""Friends"" Kudrow), whereas we pick up the main linear narrative, our primary protagonist up and decides to just move back into his aging mother's house north of San Fran, trying to somehow connect his ongoing, dysfunctional relationship(s) with women to his mom and discover just what about relating to the opposite sex in general, he's had so such trouble with.  That he decides to try such a stunt with his own mother, as opposed to former girlfriends and wives, is what gives the film its overall charm and uniqueness.  For his mom turns out to be much more than the surface caricature ""mother"" he ever imagined.This basic premise really is genius, but the detailed way it is written and played out, is even more so.  Albert's brother, a rather wealthy sports agent, who has his own special relationship with his mom, but quite a different one, figures prominently in the plot, and leads to lots of truly profound but funny as hell, moments throughout.  Indeed, before Brooks eventually moves in with his mom (setting up his ""old room"" in her home, as if he hadn't left since high school), a major factor in his decision is this brother/brother sibling rivalry for their mother's affection, which exists below the surface for both.  This in itself leads to many laughs as well as some prudent insights about mother-son-son-brother-brother relationships in general, which I can readily identify with.Still, the main focus here is about the forced if temporary connection between Albert Brooks and his mom, Debbie Reynolds, and how, beyond the trivialities of favorite ice cream, preferred peanut butter brands, and other frustrating differences between the two, so many mother-son moments ring true.  The film goes beyond such minor differences however, because so many of the idiosyncrasies which the son and mother both exhibit to each other in this strange situation of living together again after so many years, will spark recognition of themselves in most viewers.  After seeing this several times, I'm certain of that, at the very least.  While Debbie's behavior and habits confuse, confound, and at times infuriate Albert, the same can be said of Albert's quirks and his reactions, from her point of view.This is a film made up of many, many, very, very small details about the typical mother-offspring dynamic, all of which adds up one by one until at various points, it almost feels like this was all based upon a true story.  At least it felt like that for me, and I will watch this many times in the future and I'm sure I will find many more meaningful details and truths throughout.  There are times within the film where I could swear, from memories of moments in my own life, where my very own mom practically said the exact same things and acted in the exact same ways as Debbie Reynolds does.  Conversely. I can remember myself almost mimicking many of the attitudes and lines from Albert Brooks.  It is an amazing and amusing feature of this which I'm sure will resonate with most.While my mom and me personally, and our family and I suppose my siblings (brother and sister) perhaps never came close to the financial wealth generally displayed in this film (we were all a rather poor lot), it comes awfully close enough in so many ways, lines, and situations, and in the end, it all works brilliantly.  If you can't see yourself as very analogous to any of the main characters here, I'd just have to wonder just what planet you were born on, because it certainly wasn't/isn't mine.I do so miss my mother.  As I write this, it's only been less than three months, but it seems like years since she left me and her other children, as well as grandchildren, one great granddaughter, and many others who loved her so much.  I was hesitant to watch this again on cable when I saw it available, after so many years of having not seen it for so long, and I have to admit to postponing watching it because of its very title, and my loss.  But watch it I did recently, and again, and again, and it really is a special film.  It adroitly depicts the mother-sibling (especially male) relationship, more genuinely than just about any other Hollywood film I've ever seen.  And it all ends up with a wonderful and unexpected surprise last scene.While the fact that my own sweet, angelic mom only passed recently, and while I consciously take this into account as far as my extremely favorable review of this goes, I did see this long ago, when my mom was sentient and truly alive before her long illness took hold, and loved the movie back then as much as today.  And nothing has changed since, really.  This movie is not only original but stands the test of time, and my initial positive reactions to it have only been amplified in successive viewings.I love this film, and I'd like to think my mom, if she could've seen it (which I don't think she did), would've loved it as well.  This is a luminous, fun experience with many moments which I think virtually anyone can identify with in some ways at least, and hopefully, as I did, in a generally, true-to-life, life-affirming, yet hilarious at times, manner.

This comedy is so subtle, so deep, so funny. Both actors were excellent in their respective roles (mother and son). The movie was funny, entertaining but also touching and profound.I believe that everyone can relate to the story on some level. The story of this mother is the story of many women who had to give up their dreams and career to raise their children and to build a family. Their resentment towards their children is a permanent conflict with their love for them. The mother was more critical towards the writer son because he was just like her and had her talent and he actually fulfilled his dreams and became a writer. He reminded her of her frustration and the dream she had to give up.It is the best movie I have seen in years. I will purchase the DVD tomorrow. This is a movie to keep!",5,Wonderful movie.
