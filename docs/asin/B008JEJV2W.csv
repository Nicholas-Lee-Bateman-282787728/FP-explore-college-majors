1554554,A3IHUDYEOF1C29,B008JEJV2W,BookLover59,"[0, 0]","I've always enjoyed private eye or police shows that featured good writing and quirky characters.  When it comes to quirky, you can't beat ""Harry O"": an irascible ex-cop who often has to ride the bus because his old sports car, and Austin-Healey, often breaks down; an ex-cop who can quote Kipling, and enjoys a good book more than watching the boob tube; a guy who is slowly (key word being slowly) repairing a boat (called ""The Answer"") which he someday intends to sail; and a man who is happiest when left alone by most people (agreeable, pretty women being the exception). Like just about every role he tackled, David Jansen does a terrific job, investing Harry with the right touch of irascibility, charm, compassion and intelligence.Just watched the first season on DVD, after not seeing the show for over forty years (I caught about 1/3 of the episodes on television, back when it aired). Wasn't sure if it would hold up all these years later, but I was delightfully surprised.  If one -- especially if one is a younger viewer, who grew up long after rotary phones and phonographs died out, and the internet was already passe' -- takes into account the time period, the shows are well-written, well-acted and generally five star as a whole.  Harry -- a sort of TV relative of Travis McGee, since he lives on the beach (first in San Diego, then in Santa Monica) -- only takes cases he wants to take, since he's living on a pension (he retired from the police force after being shot in the back).  His cases range from missing persons to murder.  And a lot of them are genuine puzzlers that will keep viewers guessing, such as ""The Last Heir"" (a sort of Agatha Christie, locked room mystery set in the desert).  Henry Darrow played Harry's San Diego police department foil, Manny, with just the right touch; and Anthony Zerbe (who won an Emmy for his role) plays Harry's Santa Monica police contact, Lt. Trench, with zest and wit. There are lots of famous guest stars in the first season, many of them old TV stars, including Kurt Russell, Jim Backus, Stefanie Powers, Linda Evans, Sal Mineo, Robert Reed (as a hit man! I'm giving nothing away) and Maureen McCormick (the last two known for roles on ""the Brady Bunch"").  Cab Calloway (!) made an appearance as jazz/blues pianist (the same episode that featured Jim Backus, and some terrific jazz music), in ""Sound of Trumpets"". Farrah Fawcett has a recurring role from the middle of the season on, as neighbor and sometime girlfriend, Sue (a flight attendant -- or stewardess, as they called 'em back then).  Ironic, since this show was cancelled after the second season, but not due to bad ratings or critical reviews: Studio President Silverman decided to go with a show called ""Charlie's Angels"", sacrificing the good writing and acting of ""Harry O"" for the T&A; and young faces of Farrah Fawcett's star-making, but ultimately empty TV fare.If I could meet Fred Silverman today, I'd punch his lights out.  He robbed us of at least three more seasons (most shows shouldn't run more than five to seven seasons) of a great, private eye show, one that is -- quality-wise -- right up there with classics like, say, ""Mannix"" and ""The Rockford Files"".",5,Right up there with The Rockford Files!,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,3202,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'private', 'eye', 'police', 'shows', 'featured', 'good', 'writing', 'quirky', 'characters', 'When', 'quirky', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Harry', 'O', 'irascible', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'often', 'ride', 'bus', 'old', 'sports', 'car', 'Austin-Healey', 'often', 'down', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'can', 'quote', 'Kipling', 'good', 'book', 'more', 'watching', 'boob', 'tube', 'guy', 'who', 'slowly', 'key', 'word', 'being', 'slowly', 'repairing', 'boat', 'called', 'Answer', 'sail', 'man', 'who', 'happiest', 'when', 'left', 'alone', 'most', 'people', 'agreeable', 'pretty', 'women', 'being', 'exception', 'just', 'role', 'tackled', 'David', 'Jansen', 'terrific', 'job', 'investing', 'Harry', 'right', 'touch', 'irascibility', 'charm', 'compassion', 'intelligence.Just', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'not', 'seeing', 'show', 'forty', 'years', 'caught', '1/3', 'episodes', 'television', 'back', 'when', 'aired', 'Was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'delightfully', 'surprised', 'one', 'especially', 'one', 'younger', 'viewer', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'long', 'rotary', 'phones', 'phonographs', 'died', 'out', 'internet', 'was', 'already', 'passe', 'account', 'time', 'period', 'shows', 'are', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'generally', 'five', 'star', 'whole', 'Harry', 'sort', 'TV', 'relative', 'Travis', 'McGee', 'beach', 'first', 'San', 'Diego', 'then', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'only', 'cases', 'take', 'living', 'pension', 'retired', 'police', 'force', 'being', 'shot', 'back', 'cases', 'range', 'missing', 'persons', 'murder', 'lot', 'are', 'genuine', 'puzzlers', 'will', 'keep', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'such', 'Last', 'Heir', 'sort', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'locked', 'room', 'mystery', 'set', 'desert', 'Henry', 'Darrow', 'played', 'Harry', 'San', 'Diego', 'police', 'department', 'foil', 'Manny', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'who', 'won', 'Emmy', 'role', 'Harry', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'police', 'contact', 'Lt.', 'Trench', 'zest', 'wit', 'are', 'lots', 'famous', 'guest', 'stars', 'first', 'season', 'many', 'old', 'TV', 'stars', 'including', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Stefanie', 'Powers', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'hit', 'man', ""'m"", 'giving', 'nothing', 'away', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'last', 'two', 'known', 'roles', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Cab', 'Calloway', 'made', 'appearance', 'jazz/blues', 'pianist', 'same', 'episode', 'featured', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'terrific', 'jazz', 'music', 'Sound', 'Trumpets', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'recurring', 'role', 'middle', 'season', 'neighbor', 'sometime', 'girlfriend', 'Sue', 'flight', 'attendant', 'stewardess', 'called', 'back', 'then', 'Ironic', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'due', 'bad', 'ratings', 'critical', 'reviews', 'Studio', 'President', 'Silverman', 'decided', 'go', 'show', 'called', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'sacrificing', 'good', 'writing', 'acting', 'Harry', 'O', 'T', 'A', 'young', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'star-making', 'ultimately', 'empty', 'TV', 'fare.If', 'could', 'meet', 'Fred', 'Silverman', 'today', ""'d"", 'punch', 'lights', 'out', 'robbed', 'least', 'three', 'more', 'seasons', 'most', 'shows', 'should', ""n't"", 'run', 'more', 'five', 'seven', 'seasons', 'great', 'private', 'eye', 'show', 'one', 'quality-wise', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'classics', 'say', 'Mannix', 'Rockford', 'Files']",N/A

1554557,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B008JEJV2W,Gary P. Cohen,"[67, 70]","Over the years I've enjoyed many TV private detectives: Mannix, Rockford, Magnum, the guys of 77 Sunset Strip, SurfSide 6 and Checkmate, however none more than Harry O.  Harry O was the melding of a great actor and a perfect role for that actor.  The Fugitive is one of my 10 favorite series and I'v always considered the late, great David Janssen as TV's all-time best actor for that series.  However I've always felt that he was as good, or better, as Harry O.The character of Harry Orwell was sort of a low-key and grouchy one for Janssen, definitely not your average tv detective. (Janssen does a noirish voice-over at the beginning and the end of each episode.)  He was a former cop for the San Diego Police Department, shot in the back on the job and receiving disability from the department.  He works as a private detective on the side to supplement his income.  He lives on a drydocked boat on the beach that he is always fixing.(Sort of like Gibbs and his boat in the early seasons of NCIS.)  His departmental buddy is Lt. Manny Quinlan played by Henry Darrow.  Harry doesn't drive around in a flashy car like Rockford or Joe Mannix, he takes the bus.  Halfway through season one, Harry relocates to Los Angeles where he has to deal with a somewhat less-friendly cop, Lt. K.T. Trench well-played by Anthony Zerbe. (Zerbe won a best-supporting actor Emmy for this series.)  (Manny Quinlan is later murdered in the excellent episode ""Elegy for a Cop,"" leaving Harry out for revenge to capture his killer.)  When he moves to LA, Harry trades in his bus pass for a beat-up sports car that is in the shop most of the time.The first season of Harry O was successful and the series was renewed for a second season. (I've always preferred season two.)  By the end of season two, Harry O was winning its timeslot in the Nielsen ratings when it was mysteriously and shockingly cancelled by ABC. There has never been an adequate explanation for this.  (I read an interview with Zerbe years ago that said that the cancellation was the result of a new regime taking over ABC and wiping the slate clean of series they were less than enamored of.) The series was replaced with a crime drama starring Robert Stack that was quickly axed after one season.  It has always irked me that Harry O was consistently beating its competition on CBS, the mediocre detective series Barnaby Jones starring Buddy Ebsen.  Yet Barnaby Jones lasted years more and Harry O was gone after two.  Harry O premiered one day before the other great detective series of the 1970s, The Rockford Files.  Rockford Files was truly a great series and lasted seven years on NBC.  Yet I've always preferred Harry O.If you want to see the man I consider to be TV's greatest actor,David Janssen, you can pick up the four years of The Fugitive or the first season of Harry O.  I sincerely hope that Season One of this great series sells successfully, so that Warner Bros. can then release Season Two.  If whatever reason you have never made the acquaintance of Harry Orwell, then you should check this set out and see for yourself, you won't be disappointed.",5,TV's Greatest Private Detective Series,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,3117,"['years', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'many', 'TV', 'private', 'detectives', 'Mannix', 'Rockford', 'Magnum', 'guys', '77', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'SurfSide', '6', 'Checkmate', 'however', 'none', 'more', 'Harry', 'O.', 'Harry', 'O', 'was', 'melding', 'great', 'actor', 'perfect', 'role', 'actor', 'Fugitive', 'one', '10', 'favorite', 'series', 'v', 'always', 'considered', 'late', 'great', 'David', 'Janssen', 'TV', 'all-time', 'best', 'actor', 'series', 'However', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'Harry', 'O.The', 'character', 'Harry', 'Orwell', 'was', 'sort', 'low-key', 'grouchy', 'one', 'Janssen', 'definitely', 'not', 'average', 'tv', 'detective', 'Janssen', 'noirish', 'voice-over', 'beginning', 'end', 'episode', 'was', 'former', 'cop', 'San', 'Diego', 'Police', 'Department', 'shot', 'back', 'job', 'receiving', 'disability', 'department', 'private', 'detective', 'side', 'supplement', 'income', 'drydocked', 'boat', 'beach', 'always', 'fixing', 'Sort', 'Gibbs', 'boat', 'early', 'seasons', 'NCIS', 'departmental', 'buddy', 'Lt.', 'Manny', 'Quinlan', 'played', 'Henry', 'Darrow', 'Harry', ""n't"", 'drive', 'around', 'flashy', 'car', 'Rockford', 'Joe', 'Mannix', 'bus', 'Halfway', 'season', 'one', 'Harry', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'deal', 'somewhat', 'less-friendly', 'cop', 'Lt.', 'K.T', 'Trench', 'well-played', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Zerbe', 'won', 'best-supporting', 'actor', 'Emmy', 'series', 'Manny', 'Quinlan', 'later', 'murdered', 'excellent', 'episode', 'Elegy', 'Cop', 'leaving', 'Harry', 'out', 'revenge', 'capture', 'killer', 'When', 'LA', 'Harry', 'bus', 'pass', 'beat-up', 'sports', 'car', 'shop', 'most', 'time.The', 'first', 'season', 'Harry', 'O', 'was', 'successful', 'series', 'was', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', ""'ve"", 'always', 'preferred', 'season', 'two', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'Harry', 'O', 'was', 'winning', 'timeslot', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'when', 'was', 'mysteriously', 'shockingly', 'cancelled', 'ABC', 'never', 'been', 'adequate', 'explanation', 'read', 'interview', 'Zerbe', 'years', 'ago', 'said', 'cancellation', 'was', 'result', 'new', 'regime', 'taking', 'ABC', 'wiping', 'slate', 'clean', 'series', 'were', 'less', 'enamored', 'series', 'was', 'replaced', 'crime', 'drama', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'was', 'quickly', 'axed', 'one', 'season', 'always', 'irked', 'Harry', 'O', 'was', 'consistently', 'beating', 'competition', 'CBS', 'mediocre', 'detective', 'series', 'Barnaby', 'Jones', 'starring', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'Barnaby', 'Jones', 'lasted', 'years', 'more', 'Harry', 'O', 'was', 'gone', 'two', 'Harry', 'O', 'premiered', 'one', 'day', 'other', 'great', 'detective', 'series', '1970s', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'series', 'lasted', 'seven', 'years', 'NBC', ""'ve"", 'always', 'preferred', 'Harry', 'O.If', 'want', 'see', 'man', 'consider', 'be', 'TV', 'greatest', 'actor', 'David', 'Janssen', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'four', 'years', 'Fugitive', 'first', 'season', 'Harry', 'O.', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'Season', 'One', 'great', 'series', 'successfully', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'can', 'then', 'release', 'Season', 'Two', 'reason', 'have', 'never', 'made', 'acquaintance', 'Harry', 'Orwell', 'then', 'should', 'check', 'set', 'out', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

The acting, the settings, and most of the stories have a realism to them that few detective dramas of any era can match.  A lot of that probably has to do with creator Howard Rodman, whose work on Route 66 taught him the value of placing the action in real, identifiable places.  Add to that, characters who are believable...good guys who aren't supermodel handsome or infallibly smart or reliant on endless catch phrases, bad guys who aren't cardboard cutout villains...then throw in a fair amount of hand-held camera work and prints that have the gritty contrast and color saturation of early 70s television film stock, and before you know it, you have a production with the verisimilitude of a documentary.  The series really conveys a sense of the time and place in which it was set, but without looking dated.In my humble view, this first season with all the San Diego locations probably achieved a sense of realism better than the second season, set in the neverland of L.A. (although I will definitely try to keep an open mind when I view that one, as I do remember it fondly as well).  And of course, it never hurts to have David Janssen on board if you want a hero who concentrates on doing what he feels is right, despite having problems of his own--problems mainly of the kind that real people do have, that often seem to interfere with our plans and goals, and not so much a dark and psychologically troubled past like so many modern antiheros have.

David Janssen is private detective Harry O (""O for Orwell, you know, like Nineteen Eighty-Four"" quips a growling Harry to a character in one episode). Janssen is still a loner in this series as much as he was one in The Fugitive except that this time he has a lieutenant friend on the force instead of being hunted by one. Janssen makes the character of Harry O his own. After watching one episode you really like this guy, he's a good guy, one that isn't motivated by greed. He simply wants to see justice for all and he's willing to take on just about any case in which he believes something wrong needs to be set right. Harry is both street smart and book smart making him a man of rare intelligence. The plots are interesting, the writing is quite good and if you liked Janssen in The Fugitive, as much as I did, then you'll be glad to see that he returned to TV in this 1974-76 series. The series was abruptly cancelled after season two by ABC president Fred Silverman who reportedly preferred fluff and garbage like Charlie's Angels.

1554562,A3E3HHHYYX4AMS,B008JEJV2W,Mike,"[1, 1]","Harry O is about a private detective called Harry Orwell played by David Jannsen who is retired from the police force after having a bullet lodged in his back. He lives in a beach house in San Diego and takes on cases to make ends meet. His best friend is Lt Manny Quinlan played by Henry Darrow ( Manolito Montoya from ""The High Chaparral"") who sometimes wishes he wasn't, as Harry uses the police forces resources to help with his own cases. He even helps himself to the coffee in the police precinct often when it is the last cup.This is an excellent police drama  that unfortunately only lasted two seasons. This was also David Jannsen's final series. Before he had been in ""Richard Diamond.Private Detective"", then the iconic series ""The Fugitive"" and then ""O Hara U.S. Treasury"".He was an impeccable actor who was good in whatever he was in.Plenty of guest stars over the two seasons like;Leif Erickson [ The High Chaparral ]Broderick Crawford [ Highway Patrol ]Robert Reed [ The Brady Bunch ]Barbara Anderson [ Ironside ]Kurt Russell [ the Quest ]Barry Sullivan [ The Tall Man ]Martin Sheen [ The West Wing ]Midway during the first season the locale was changed to Los Angeles. Henry Darrow's character was out and Anthony Zerbe came in as Lt Trench who hated Orwell's interference on police cases and wished he would just go away.But he grew to admire  and almost came to like Orwell.Paul Tully played Roberts, Lt Trench's sidekick. Farrah Fawcett would also join the cast in a semi-regular role as Harry's neighbour, Sue.Henry Darrow's character would return one last time in a touching episode titled ""Elegy for a Cop"" where he is killed trying to save his niece from a drug dealer in L.A.The wisecracks between Orwell and Trench are terrific. Anthony Zerbe certainly had a flair for comedy considering he has mostly played bad guys.Bonus features on season 1 is the pilot movie ""Such Dust as Dreams are Made On.

I'm in the process of watching Season 1 and the narration and stories are still absorbing!  I love the line near the end of ""Guardian At The Gates"" when Harry says of Barry Sullivan's mean character: ""Maybe that's the secret of greatness; to always be alone and never be lonely.

1554566,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B008JEJV2W,Terry Sunday,"[27, 27]","Right up front I'll admit that I wasn't a huge fan of ""The Fugitive"" when it aired on network television for four seasons starting in 1963. Oh, I watched it, along with most other Americans, but I was very young at the time and the show didn't make a strong impression on me. Nor did actor David Janssen, who played the title role.Fast-forward 10 years to 1973, though, when Janssen returned to network television as crusty private detective Harry Orwell in the short-lived series ""Harry O."" That one DID make a strong impression on me, and I've been anxiously awaiting its arrival on DVD for--well, for about as long as DVDs have been around. At last my waiting is over. Warner Brothers finally released the first season in a six-DVD set that includes all 22 episodes plus the original pilot, all in color. Hopefully the second and final season will follow soon. All six DVDs come in a case no thicker than the type that normally contains just one DVD--it's very efficient packaging.If you grew up at a certain time and had any interest in quality television shows, you're probably already familiar with ""Harry O,"" and buying this set will be a no-brainer. If you've never heard of it but are a David Janssen fan, you should treat yourself to this series. He brings a maturity and world-weariness to the role of Harry Orwell that were missing from his portrayal of Richard Kimble in ""The Fugitive."" Orwell seems to be a character specifically designed for Janssen to play, and the actor's performances in the show are superb--as are those of the supporting cast, especially Anthony Zerbe, and guest stars including Stefanie Powers, Linda Evans, Martin Sheen and Cab Calloway.Here's the place where I'd normally gripe about the fact that this DVD set is: a) burned-to-order on disks of questionable longevity, and b) quite expensive considering the utter lack of extras. But I guess I'm slowly accepting the reality that high-priced, made-to-order DVDs are better than none at all. And this set IS marginally cheaper than ""The Fugitive"" and ""The FBI,"" in which each season was split into two DVD sets, each about the same price as the entire first season of ""Harry O.""The data side of Disk 6 in my set came with a very deep, inch-long radial scratch. None of the DVDs were loose inside the case when the order arrived, so the damage didn't occur during shipment. I watched that disk immediately, just in case I might have to return it, but it worked fine. So now I've started back at the beginning, watching each and every episode of this superb series that demonstrates just how good television drama could be 40 years ago.",5,"""A hundred bucks a day, plus expenses...""",1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,2624,"['Right', 'up', 'front', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Fugitive', 'when', 'aired', 'network', 'television', 'four', 'seasons', 'starting', '1963', 'Oh', 'watched', 'most', 'other', 'Americans', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'time', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'strong', 'impression', 'did', 'actor', 'David', 'Janssen', 'who', 'played', 'title', 'role.Fast-forward', '10', 'years', '1973', 'though', 'when', 'Janssen', 'returned', 'network', 'television', 'crusty', 'private', 'detective', 'Harry', 'Orwell', 'short-lived', 'series', 'Harry', 'O', 'one', 'DID', 'make', 'strong', 'impression', ""'ve"", 'been', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'arrival', 'DVD', 'well', 'about', 'as', 'long', 'DVDs', 'have', 'been', 'around', 'last', 'waiting', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'finally', 'released', 'first', 'season', 'six-DVD', 'set', '22', 'episodes', 'original', 'pilot', 'color', 'Hopefully', 'second', 'final', 'season', 'will', 'follow', 'soon', 'six', 'DVDs', 'come', 'case', 'thicker', 'type', 'normally', 'just', 'one', 'DVD', 'very', 'efficient', 'packaging.If', 'grew', 'up', 'certain', 'time', 'had', 'interest', 'quality', 'television', 'shows', ""'re"", 'probably', 'already', 'familiar', 'Harry', 'O', 'buying', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'no-brainer', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'are', 'David', 'Janssen', 'fan', 'should', 'treat', 'series', 'maturity', 'world-weariness', 'role', 'Harry', 'Orwell', 'were', 'missing', 'portrayal', 'Richard', 'Kimble', 'Fugitive', 'Orwell', 'be', 'character', 'specifically', 'designed', 'Janssen', 'play', 'actor', 'performances', 'show', 'are', 'superb', 'are', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Stefanie', 'Powers', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Cab', 'Calloway.Here', 'place', 'where', ""'d"", 'normally', 'gripe', 'fact', 'DVD', 'set', 'burned-to-order', 'disks', 'questionable', 'longevity', 'b', 'quite', 'expensive', 'considering', 'utter', 'lack', 'extras', 'guess', ""'m"", 'slowly', 'accepting', 'reality', 'high-priced', 'made-to-order', 'DVDs', 'are', 'better', 'none', 'set', 'IS', 'marginally', 'cheaper', 'Fugitive', 'FBI', 'season', 'was', 'split', 'two', 'DVD', 'sets', 'same', 'price', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'Harry', 'O', 'data', 'side', 'Disk', '6', 'set', 'came', 'very', 'deep', 'inch-long', 'radial', 'scratch', 'None', 'DVDs', 'were', 'loose', 'case', 'when', 'order', 'arrived', 'damage', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'shipment', 'watched', 'disk', 'immediately', 'just', 'case', 'might', 'have', 'return', 'worked', 'fine', 'So', 'now', ""'ve"", 'started', 'back', 'beginning', 'watching', 'episode', 'superb', 'series', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'television', 'drama', 'could', 'be', '40', 'years', 'ago']",N/A
1554567,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B008JEJV2W,trebe,"[2, 3]","Familiar for playing Richard Kimble inThe Fugitive(1963-67), David JanssenThe Green Berets), returned to series television for two seasons as Harry Orwell, a former cop turned private detective.  The Season One DVD release of Harry O (1974-75) contains 22 episodes, plus the series' original pilot, ""Such Dust As Dreams Are Made Of"", in which it is revealed that after being shot during a robbery, Orwell retired from the force, and became a private investigator.Orwell is a cynical, world-weary sort, pursing an escapist lifestyle, living at the beach, and working on his boat, in his spare time.  With a bullet lodged near his spine, Orwell generally avoids confrontations, or employing force.  Instead he uses brains, determination, and an ability to read people, to solve his cases.  Exhibiting a quiet confidence, people are often willing to put their trust in him, and women in particular, seem to be won over by Harry's charms.The series begins with Orwell living in Coronado, San Diego, where he is often helped by his old friend, police Lt. Manny Quinlan (Henry Darrow).  After 14 episodes, Harry relocates to Los Angeles, where he forges a relationship with Lt. Trench (Anthony Zerbe), who slowly becomes accustomed to his methods.  The talented Zerbe would win an Emmy, for his work in the second season of Harry O.  The move from San Diego to LA was apparently to reduce production costs, and tone of the series does change, as Orwell has a more contentious relationship with Trench.  Often lacking a working vehicle, early episodes featured Orwell traveling by bus.  However, as the series progressed, Harry required more reliable means of transportation.The writing is generally pretty solid, with the focus more on character development and story construction, rather than action oriented segments.  While there is still the occasional car chase, explosion, or shootout, much more time is spent observing Orwell follow up leads, and interact with people, like a real detective might do.  The list of guest stars is impressive, and the quality of the material, seems to result in elevated performances, almost always making the program an interesting watch.David Janssen does a fabulous acting job, as the intelligent and deep Orwell, is also kind of an enigmatic loner, with a dark sense of humor.  The occasional narration that Orwell provides during the episodes, often reveals how downbeat a person he really is.  While not quite the tortured soul that Richard Kimble was, Orwell often seems frustrated, and unable to have much fun.  Even when romance comes his way, it seems superficial.  The program is not without humor, but it is usually quite subdued.  If you can't get into the series' downbeat atmosphere, you probably will not become a big fan.The Rockford Files(1974-80), which featured James Garner as another southern California private investigator, living at the beach, also premiered in 1974.  Jim Rockford was kind of a lovable loser, with a sense of humor about life, who with the help of his friends and family, operated with great style and flair.  More serious and dark, Harry O takes a different approach, one without car chases, slick dialog, or elaborate con games.Both examples of the best of the 70's private detective genre, these two shows each featured fine writing, great guest stars, and solid acting performances.  While Harry O only lasted for two seasons, fortunately they are both available on high quality DVD-R.  The episodes are not subtitled, but do have chapter stops, and image quality is pretty good.  David Janssen (1931-1980) was a very talented actor, who did some excellent work in series television, and Harry O is certainly a highlight.  Hopefully his 1971 series O'Hara U.S. Treasury, will also get a DVD release soon.",4,"David Janssen shines as a sensitive, low key private eye...",1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,3783,"['Familiar', 'playing', 'Richard', 'Kimble', 'inThe', 'Fugitive', '1963-67', 'David', 'JanssenThe', 'Green', 'Berets', 'returned', 'series', 'television', 'two', 'seasons', 'Harry', 'Orwell', 'former', 'cop', 'turned', 'private', 'detective', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', 'release', 'Harry', 'O', '1974-75', '22', 'episodes', 'series', 'original', 'pilot', 'Such', 'Dust', 'Dreams', 'Are', 'Made', 'revealed', 'being', 'shot', 'robbery', 'Orwell', 'retired', 'force', 'became', 'private', 'investigator.Orwell', 'cynical', 'world-weary', 'sort', 'pursing', 'escapist', 'lifestyle', 'living', 'beach', 'working', 'boat', 'spare', 'time', 'bullet', 'lodged', 'spine', 'Orwell', 'generally', 'confrontations', 'employing', 'force', 'Instead', 'brains', 'determination', 'ability', 'read', 'people', 'solve', 'cases', 'Exhibiting', 'quiet', 'confidence', 'people', 'are', 'often', 'willing', 'put', 'trust', 'women', 'particular', 'seem', 'be', 'won', 'Harry', 'charms.The', 'series', 'Orwell', 'living', 'Coronado', 'San', 'Diego', 'where', 'often', 'helped', 'old', 'friend', 'police', 'Lt.', 'Manny', 'Quinlan', 'Henry', 'Darrow', '14', 'episodes', 'Harry', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'relationship', 'Lt.', 'Trench', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'who', 'slowly', 'accustomed', 'methods', 'talented', 'Zerbe', 'would', 'win', 'Emmy', 'work', 'second', 'season', 'Harry', 'O', 'move', 'San', 'Diego', 'LA', 'was', 'apparently', 'reduce', 'production', 'costs', 'tone', 'series', 'change', 'Orwell', 'more', 'contentious', 'relationship', 'Trench', 'Often', 'lacking', 'working', 'vehicle', 'early', 'episodes', 'featured', 'Orwell', 'traveling', 'bus', 'However', 'series', 'progressed', 'Harry', 'required', 'more', 'reliable', 'means', 'transportation.The', 'writing', 'generally', 'pretty', 'solid', 'focus', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'construction', 'rather', 'action', 'oriented', 'segments', 'still', 'occasional', 'car', 'chase', 'explosion', 'shootout', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'observing', 'Orwell', 'follow', 'up', 'leads', 'interact', 'people', 'real', 'detective', 'might', 'do', 'list', 'guest', 'stars', 'impressive', 'quality', 'material', 'result', 'elevated', 'performances', 'almost', 'always', 'making', 'program', 'interesting', 'watch.David', 'Janssen', 'fabulous', 'acting', 'job', 'intelligent', 'deep', 'Orwell', 'also', 'kind', 'enigmatic', 'loner', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'occasional', 'narration', 'Orwell', 'episodes', 'often', 'how', 'downbeat', 'person', 'really', 'not', 'quite', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Richard', 'Kimble', 'was', 'Orwell', 'often', 'frustrated', 'unable', 'have', 'much', 'fun', 'Even', 'when', 'romance', 'way', 'superficial', 'program', 'not', 'humor', 'usually', 'quite', 'subdued', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'series', 'downbeat', 'atmosphere', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'become', 'big', 'fan.The', 'Rockford', 'Files', '1974-80', 'featured', 'James', 'Garner', 'southern', 'California', 'private', 'investigator', 'living', 'beach', 'also', 'premiered', '1974', 'Jim', 'Rockford', 'was', 'kind', 'lovable', 'loser', 'sense', 'humor', 'life', 'who', 'help', 'friends', 'family', 'operated', 'great', 'style', 'flair', 'More', 'serious', 'dark', 'Harry', 'O', 'different', 'approach', 'one', 'car', 'chases', 'slick', 'dialog', 'elaborate', 'con', 'games.Both', 'examples', 'best', '70', 'private', 'detective', 'genre', 'two', 'shows', 'featured', 'fine', 'writing', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'solid', 'acting', 'performances', 'Harry', 'O', 'only', 'lasted', 'two', 'seasons', 'fortunately', 'are', 'available', 'high', 'quality', 'DVD-R', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'subtitled', 'do', 'have', 'chapter', 'stops', 'image', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'David', 'Janssen', '1931-1980', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'did', 'excellent', 'work', 'series', 'television', 'Harry', 'O', 'certainly', 'highlight', 'Hopefully', '1971', 'series', ""O'Hara"", 'U.S.', 'Treasury', 'will', 'also', 'get', 'DVD', 'release', 'soon']",N/A
