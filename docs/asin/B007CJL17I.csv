For one, the title seemed pretty stupid and I'm not really into the vampire stuff but I was surprised when I watched this show and totally fell in love with it. And Atticus Mitchell.The episodes and the movie are all really fun to watch and if you have little kids, you don't have to worry about scaring them because it's mostly kind of silly Wizards- of- Waverly Place magic and supernatural stuff, not serious and bloody.Anyways, this show is great and it has amazing actors.

1529903,A2M85JGCPOR97Y,B007CJL17I,Misterbanks,"[27, 30]","This is a diamond in the rough. There are so many silly kids shows out there that aim at the lowest common denominator. This one does not do that. Yes, it does go for that vampire craze that's going around since twilight. But in a lot of ways it does it better. I haven't seen twilight, but I know it's basic gist and this is better. It gives you that vampire fun without straying away from family friendly. The writing and the acting are top notch.A lot of the fans swoon over the two leads Matthew Knight and Atticus Mitchell. They do a very good job of being lovable geeks on a quest to be cool, whilst fighting the forces of the evil supernatural. However, the real strong acting talent in this show comes from the third male lead, Cameron Kennedy. His character is silly, and at times not on the same page as the rest. But he has the most comedic and dramatic talent of all of them, and deserves a big acting career cause he has the chops. He doesn't just seem like he's reading lines when he ""get's his geek on"" the way Knight does. He really owns the part.  If the show was just Cameron's character it would still be almost as entertaining. He needs more screen time, to say the least. The female leads Vanessa Morgan and Kate Todd are beautiful and funny. They are both tough and smart. They are perfect for their roles and make the show as well.This show gets a 10/10.",5,"This is the quality TV that people remember, Now",1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,1377,"['diamond', 'rough', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'silly', 'kids', 'out', 'there', 'aim', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'one', 'not', 'do', 'Yes', 'go', 'vampire', 'going', 'around', 'twilight', 'lot', 'ways', 'better', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'twilight', 'know', 'basic', 'gist', 'better', 'vampire', 'fun', 'straying', 'away', 'family', 'friendly', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'top', 'notch.A', 'lot', 'fans', 'swoon', 'two', 'leads', 'Matthew', 'Knight', 'Atticus', 'Mitchell', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'lovable', 'geeks', 'quest', 'be', 'cool', 'whilst', 'fighting', 'forces', 'evil', 'supernatural', 'However', 'real', 'strong', 'acting', 'talent', 'show', 'third', 'male', 'lead', 'Cameron', 'Kennedy', 'character', 'silly', 'times', 'not', 'same', 'page', 'rest', 'most', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'talent', 'big', 'acting', 'career', 'cause', 'chops', ""n't"", 'just', 'seem', 'reading', 'lines', 'when', 'get', 'geek', 'way', 'Knight', 'really', 'part', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'Cameron', 'character', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'almost', 'entertaining', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'say', 'least', 'female', 'leads', 'Vanessa', 'Morgan', 'Kate', 'Todd', 'are', 'beautiful', 'funny', 'are', 'tough', 'smart', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'make', 'show', 'well.This', 'show', '10/10']",My Babysitter's a Vampire: Season 1

Buy it.  Buy it now.  Seriously stop reading the review and buy it.  Haha.  What I was super impressed with though when it came to the movie was they pieced it together so it's one complete movie.  Like with most made for TV movies there's a bit of black when it goes to the commercial, and then it comes back.  If you watch the movie enough times on TV you know where they break for commercial but on the DVD it's as if it's a theater experience.  To be honest I haven't even watched any episodes from the DVD, because I just wanted the movie, but if you enjoyed the series on TV you will enjoy the DVD as it has all the episodes.
