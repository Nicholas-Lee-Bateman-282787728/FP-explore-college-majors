Burchfield,"[1, 2]","I missed seeing Ecks vs. Sever in the theatre and knew enough not to trust the pretty ads (they're so often the best part of a movie)so I didn't know what to think when I read the reviews here at Amazon. I was pleased (after seeing it on TV)to see that it wasn't quite so bad as so many people seem to think.The plot line seems to center on a U.S. Govt. agency gone bad with a commander who's just plain criminal (out for money & power). They've stolen a prototype nanobot killing machine (the worst plot hole in the movie is that Gant wants the perfect killer but destroys the lab, taking nothing but the prototype, if it's so great he'd also want manufacturing capabilities)and used The Boss's (Gant) stepson (Ecks later finds that the kid is really his)as a carrier for the thing to get it back to America (plot hole #2, why to Canada instead of the US?)Sever is a former agent of the DIA who left when they killed her son. The only part of the movie where you can really call it Ecks vs. Sever is at the start when he's trying to arrest her, they soon find that they're really on the same side (she kidnapped the boy to keep Gant from getting the nanobot).There are a lot of explosions and miraculous escapes (this is a movie, not reality which would have more deaths & injuries than I think were actually depicted on screen)but the basic plot line(s) of criminals stealing a weapon, an ex member taking it from them and dodging the law and the crooks all the way with the good guys (who seem kind of vicious themselves)winning in the end does work pretty well. You need to pay attention, remember that people really ARE working on such killing devices, and suspend belief just a little.I found that the start of the movie followed by the last part, then the middle part of the movie seemed to be the best way to sort it all out. I thought that Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas did a god job in portraying their roles.",3,"31/2 stars, better than I expected, better than many say",1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,1919,"['missed', 'seeing', 'Ecks', 'vs', 'Sever', 'theatre', 'knew', 'enough', 'not', 'trust', 'pretty', 'ads', ""'re"", 'so', 'often', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'when', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'was', 'pleased', 'seeing', 'TV', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'bad', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'think.The', 'plot', 'line', 'center', 'U.S.', 'Govt', 'agency', 'gone', 'bad', 'commander', 'who', 'just', 'plain', 'criminal', 'out', 'money', 'power', ""'ve"", 'stolen', 'prototype', 'nanobot', 'killing', 'machine', 'worst', 'plot', 'hole', 'movie', 'Gant', 'perfect', 'killer', 'lab', 'taking', 'nothing', 'prototype', 'so', 'great', ""'d"", 'also', 'want', 'manufacturing', 'capabilities', 'used', 'Boss', 'Gant', 'stepson', 'Ecks', 'later', 'kid', 'really', 'carrier', 'thing', 'get', 'back', 'America', 'plot', 'hole', '2', 'why', 'Canada', 'instead', 'US', 'Sever', 'former', 'agent', 'DIA', 'who', 'left', 'when', 'killed', 'son', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'where', 'can', 'really', 'call', 'Ecks', 'vs', 'Sever', 'start', 'when', 'trying', 'arrest', 'soon', 'find', ""'re"", 'really', 'same', 'side', 'kidnapped', 'boy', 'keep', 'Gant', 'getting', 'nanobot', 'are', 'lot', 'explosions', 'miraculous', 'escapes', 'movie', 'not', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'deaths', 'injuries', 'think', 'were', 'actually', 'depicted', 'screen', 'basic', 'plot', 'line', 's', 'criminals', 'stealing', 'weapon', 'ex', 'member', 'taking', 'dodging', 'law', 'crooks', 'way', 'good', 'guys', 'who', 'seem', 'kind', 'vicious', 'winning', 'end', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'remember', 'people', 'really', 'ARE', 'working', 'such', 'killing', 'devices', 'suspend', 'belief', 'just', 'little.I', 'found', 'start', 'movie', 'followed', 'last', 'part', 'then', 'middle', 'part', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'best', 'way', 'sort', 'thought', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'did', 'god', 'job', 'portraying', 'roles']",N/A

And oh, how I *enjoyed* her 5 lines in the movie.  &lt;major sarcasm here people>  There was a lot of, as my friend says, slow-motion hair tossing.The story is about a rogue agent Sever who has made off with a microdevice that kills at the press of a button.  Ecks is another government agent brought in on the case to find Sever and retrieve this device.  They soon realize their real enemy isn't one another, but rather Sever's old boss.  Bang bang, boom boom.  You can guess the ending.I predicted the ending by watching the trailer.  With that piece of the suspense missing, watching the film became a bit tedious.  Sure there were lots of explosions and high-tech devices, but in the end you ask yourself ""Wasn't that unnecessary?""  Even gratuitous I might say.  It's also hard to believe how, super-spy or no super-spy, Sever manages to obtain the arsenal of a small army and a BMW X5?  (I suppose on her super-salary.)I'm SO disappointed with this film!

726832,AYSWADHW28S1A,B00007CVTH,Amazon Customer,"[5, 8]","I don't have very high standards for plot in action movies, so I can forgive the overall weakness of the story line.  I can forgive the sheer implausibility even of the basic premise for the film (heck, if I could swallow the premise for The Matrix, I have no right to complain about lame premises ever again).  There are two things I can't forgive in an action movie, though, and Ballistic - Ecks vs. Sever has both:First, it prevents two very cool actors from being cool.Antonio Banderas spends the whole film unkempt, poorly shaven, and slouching.  Antonio Banderas does all of the above very convincingly, but having seen him in Desperado (ASIN: 0800130448), The Mask of Zorro (ASIN: B00005MEV1), heck, even Spy Kids (ASIN: B00003CXWJ), I know how very well he does the suave man of action, and I just hated to see him doing his scruffy bit all the way through.Ditto for Lucy Liu.  The thing that makes her so watchable (apart from the fact that she's unbelievably gorgeous) is the way she gives her characters strong personalities that shine through in every scene.  Not so in this film.  It seems the director wanted her to appear to be a killing machine through most of the film.  Her face is completely expressionless until near the end, and I just couldn't stand watching Lucy Liu fighting without knowing how her character was feeling.  Was she excited?  Frightened? Depressed?  There was no way to tell, because her face was just blank the whole time.  It could have been somebody else walking around in a Lucy Liu mask, for all I could see of her personality.The second big mistake this film made is that the bad guys were just way too stupid in the action scenes.  I don't like bad guys who line up to get killed, especially if they're supposed to be some kind of super commandos.There's one scene in the film where about 50 of the bad guys' elite assassins go after the heroes in a freight yard.  First, when they move out of cover, they do it all together in a nice line 50 abreast rather than filtering in.  Then, they clump together in small groups conveniently near to explosive charges, or run single file out in the open between rows of trains all ready for the heroes to empty their machine guns at them.Now, I'm not what you'd call a great military tactician, but clustering in groups and running around in straight lines when there are people with machine guns and explosives nearby?  I'd hope even a Hollywood director could figure out how stupiod that is.This one achieves depths of implausibility in action scenes not seen since Commando (ASIN: 6305364664)...  At least in Commando, though, for better or for worse, Schwarzenegger was able to do his personality thing.I definitely recommend skipping this one in favor of a Desperado/Charlie's Angels double feature.",2,"Poorly written, poorly executed",1052697600,"05 12, 2003",2003,2791,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'high', 'standards', 'plot', 'action', 'movies', 'can', 'forgive', 'overall', 'weakness', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'forgive', 'sheer', 'implausibility', 'even', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'heck', 'could', 'swallow', 'premise', 'Matrix', 'have', 'right', 'complain', 'lame', 'premises', 'ever', 'again', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'action', 'movie', 'though', 'Ballistic', 'Ecks', 'vs', 'Sever', 'First', 'two', 'very', 'cool', 'actors', 'being', 'cool.Antonio', 'Banderas', 'whole', 'film', 'unkempt', 'poorly', 'shaven', 'slouching', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'above', 'very', 'convincingly', 'having', 'seen', 'Desperado', 'ASIN', '0800130448', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'ASIN', 'B00005MEV1', 'heck', 'even', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'ASIN', 'B00003CXWJ', 'know', 'how', 'very', 'well', 'suave', 'man', 'action', 'just', 'hated', 'see', 'doing', 'scruffy', 'bit', 'way', 'through.Ditto', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'thing', 'so', 'watchable', 'apart', 'fact', 'unbelievably', 'gorgeous', 'way', 'characters', 'strong', 'personalities', 'shine', 'scene', 'Not', 'so', 'film', 'director', 'wanted', 'appear', 'be', 'killing', 'machine', 'most', 'film', 'face', 'completely', 'expressionless', 'end', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watching', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'fighting', 'knowing', 'how', 'character', 'was', 'feeling', 'Was', 'excited', 'Frightened', 'Depressed', 'was', 'way', 'tell', 'face', 'was', 'just', 'blank', 'whole', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'somebody', 'else', 'walking', 'around', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'mask', 'could', 'see', 'personality.The', 'second', 'big', 'mistake', 'film', 'made', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'stupid', 'action', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'line', 'up', 'get', 'killed', 'especially', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'super', 'commandos.There', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'where', '50', 'bad', 'guys', 'elite', 'assassins', 'go', 'heroes', 'freight', 'yard', 'First', 'when', 'move', 'cover', 'do', 'together', 'nice', 'line', '50', 'abreast', 'rather', 'filtering', 'Then', 'clump', 'together', 'small', 'groups', 'conveniently', 'explosive', 'charges', 'run', 'single', 'file', 'out', 'open', 'rows', 'trains', 'ready', 'heroes', 'empty', 'machine', 'guns', 'them.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'great', 'military', 'tactician', 'clustering', 'groups', 'running', 'around', 'straight', 'lines', 'when', 'are', 'people', 'machine', 'guns', 'explosives', 'nearby', ""'d"", 'hope', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'stupiod', 'is.This', 'one', 'depths', 'implausibility', 'action', 'scenes', 'not', 'seen', 'Commando', 'ASIN', '6305364664', 'least', 'Commando', 'though', 'better', 'worse', 'Schwarzenegger', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'personality', 'thing.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'one', 'favor', 'Desperado/Charlie', 'Angels', 'double', 'feature']",N/A

The movie opens with a child kidnapping and a chase of the kidnapper (Lucy Liu). Later an expert (Antonio Banderas) is brought-in to find the kid and get the kidnapper. The bulk of the movie is a cat-and-mouse between these two. OK, let me explain that cat-and-mouse in this case means massive explosions, vast amounts of ammo expended, lots of cars and stuff blown-up. Lots and lots of action and explosions and shooting!Later in the movie certain character connections are exposed and relations change, the cat-and-mouse team-up to go after the real bad-guy in the movie. Oh, add lots more action and explosions including most of a train yard getting blown-up.So why three stars? Well, usually I really like Liu and Banderas.

Lucy plays Sever, an ex agent who's on a mission to seek revenge against the man who took away her family. Antonio Banderas plays Johnathon Ecks, an FBI agent who's also seeking revenge on the same man for taking his wife and making her think he was dead. Both Ecks and Sever believe they are working against eachother which leads to some nice fighting and action sequences; one in which involves Sever on top of a bridge with a rocket launcher firing at any threats that come her way. Martial arts, car chases, explosions, shootings and kickings are just a few of the things you can expect to see in this movie which is also surprisingly touching when Ecks and Sever team up and learn more about eachother's past.

I don't know what they were watching, or what they were on when watching it.  This movie is a mess.  I love action pictures and this one has A LOT of that, but the one thing it doesn't have is a plot that makes any sense!  You mean during the entire seven years FBI agent Banderas doesn't have or know anybody who just happened to see his supposed dead wife with his ex-buddy Gant (Clark)?  I know secret agents are supposed to stay secret, but COME ON!!  Besides wouldn't an agent check for body parts after the supposed explosion that he lost his wife in?  And all we have of Lucy Liu's reason for vengeance is a photo of her and an infant, we see no agony or anger -- couldn't they have given that to us in a flashback - her searching through the wreckage looking for her dead child and the horror of the loss?  If you get the DVD, you can learn more about what's ""supposedly"" going on by watching the documentary, but you really shouldn't have to watch another movie to explain the one you're watching.  I love Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas, but this was just down right silly at times.  For example, Lucy Liu helps Banderas escape from local police by firing rockets at the prison bus he's handcuffed on!  Huh?  Does she belong to psychic friends, so that she knew he was going to survive despite the two rockets she fired at it and the tumble role it did and it breaking apart, not to mention it catching fire! I wish they would have just spent a little more money on dialogue, character development to make the final revenge for Sever all the more sweeter.  The end came too quick, they could have drawn it out a little longer with her talking the bad guy through his eventual death.

726846,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00007CVTH,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","I checked the ratings content for this movie and it said it has 'strong violence', and all I can say isI've seen much stronger violence than this.  ""Ballistic"" isn't what I call a terrible movie.  Unlike ""The Mod Squad"", stuff actually happens in this film.  When there are explosives, they blow up.  When people have guns, they shoot. When cars appear, there will be chases.  From my eyes, it's an action film built on the mindless mish-mosh of pyrotechnics and bullets.  It's far from the best of mindless actions films, but it did okay.The story is in a bit on the loopy side. In the beginning, the mother, who's played by Kitana from the ""Mortal Kombat"" movies, got to visit her son but then her husband, Robert Gant, ordered to bring his son back after she spend about five minutes with him. Just as the boy's bodyguards were to take him back, he was kidnapped by a rouge assassin codenamed Sever (Liu).  The FBI hired a former agent named Ecks (Banderas) to arrest Gant, who happens to be the director of the DIA with criminal ties, and to do so he has to find the assassin who has the son, who also carried a deadly nanomachine planted within him by his father. He didn't want to, but when they mentioned the wife (which he thought was dead but is really alive), he joined in. Ecks chased Sever around, they fought, but later they don't and eventually join forces once she told him the truth about the wife, and together they fight the unambiguous bad guy.  And boy, Robert Gant is extremely unsubtle: the guy smiles and he has that smug look on his face, all throughout the entire movie; he might as well wear a shirt that says ""I'm the villain"".One thing I gotta give this movie credit for is that the film's shot in Vancouver and it takes place in Vancouver. Which begs the question as to why the FBI and DIA, both US security forces, are taking action outside their jurisdiction. To be fair, I only discovered this plot hole online, and there were other big questions that stabbed into my mind: Why didn't the bad guy bother to have his son shipped to his mother if he was gonna take him back at the last second? Why did Sever had to shoot a security official when she had a good opportunity to escape, especially after a hectic fight from the cops? Why did the cops arrest Ecks for apparently shooting his superior when he's nowhere near him, and why didn't the superior clear that up (who was alive at the time)? What happened to the FBI after he was arrested?  How did gun manage to shoot backwards to kill the one holding it in one scene?  Why didn't the bad guy just implant the deadly nanomachine into one of the members of his team and put him into hiding instead of risking it on his child?It had an incredulously dumb plot, but ""Ballistic"" doesn't want to provoke anything wise.  If I wanted to see a thought-provoking action film, I would've seen ""Inception"".  The action scenes in the film weren't bad, it doesn't try to be too fancy except for the lousy scenes where it's slow-motion from one position and normal-timed on the other.  The movie did have the worst reaction to a gunshot I've seen: at one point in the film, Sever shot a bad guy in the arm, and he just dropped it on the side and nonchalantly said ""ouch""; it's funny in a way.  Dumb as it is, it's got enough explosions and gunfights to merit some kind of watchability. Too bad there weren't enough sound and fury to disguise the awful love song in the end credits.",3,Isn't SEVERe enough to ECKS this movie,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,3452,"['checked', 'ratings', 'content', 'movie', 'said', ""'strong"", 'violence', 'can', 'say', 'isI', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'stronger', 'violence', 'Ballistic', ""n't"", 'what', 'call', 'terrible', 'movie', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'stuff', 'actually', 'film', 'When', 'are', 'explosives', 'blow', 'up', 'When', 'people', 'have', 'guns', 'shoot', 'When', 'cars', 'appear', 'will', 'be', 'chases', 'eyes', 'action', 'film', 'built', 'mindless', 'mish-mosh', 'pyrotechnics', 'bullets', 'far', 'best', 'mindless', 'actions', 'films', 'did', 'okay.The', 'story', 'bit', 'loopy', 'side', 'beginning', 'mother', 'who', 'played', 'Kitana', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'movies', 'got', 'visit', 'son', 'then', 'husband', 'Robert', 'Gant', 'ordered', 'bring', 'son', 'back', 'spend', 'five', 'minutes', 'Just', 'boy', 'bodyguards', 'were', 'take', 'back', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'rouge', 'assassin', 'codenamed', 'Sever', 'Liu', 'FBI', 'hired', 'former', 'agent', 'named', 'Ecks', 'Banderas', 'arrest', 'Gant', 'who', 'be', 'director', 'DIA', 'criminal', 'ties', 'do', 'so', 'find', 'assassin', 'who', 'son', 'who', 'also', 'carried', 'deadly', 'nanomachine', 'planted', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'when', 'mentioned', 'wife', 'thought', 'was', 'dead', 'really', 'alive', 'joined', 'Ecks', 'chased', 'Sever', 'fought', 'later', 'do', ""n't"", 'eventually', 'join', 'forces', 'once', 'told', 'truth', 'wife', 'together', 'fight', 'unambiguous', 'bad', 'guy', 'boy', 'Robert', 'Gant', 'extremely', 'unsubtle', 'guy', 'smiles', 'smug', 'look', 'face', 'entire', 'movie', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'shirt', ""'m"", 'villain', '.One', 'thing', 'got', 'ta', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'film', 'shot', 'Vancouver', 'place', 'Vancouver', 'Which', 'question', 'why', 'FBI', 'DIA', 'US', 'security', 'forces', 'are', 'taking', 'action', 'jurisdiction', 'be', 'fair', 'only', 'discovered', 'plot', 'hole', 'online', 'were', 'other', 'big', 'questions', 'stabbed', 'mind', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'bad', 'guy', 'bother', 'have', 'son', 'shipped', 'mother', 'was', 'gon', 'take', 'back', 'last', 'second', 'Why', 'did', 'Sever', 'had', 'shoot', 'security', 'official', 'when', 'had', 'good', 'opportunity', 'escape', 'especially', 'hectic', 'fight', 'cops', 'Why', 'did', 'cops', 'arrest', 'Ecks', 'apparently', 'shooting', 'superior', 'when', 'nowhere', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'superior', 'clear', 'who', 'was', 'alive', 'time', 'What', 'happened', 'FBI', 'was', 'arrested', 'How', 'did', 'gun', 'manage', 'shoot', 'backwards', 'kill', 'one', 'holding', 'one', 'scene', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'implant', 'deadly', 'nanomachine', 'one', 'members', 'team', 'put', 'hiding', 'instead', 'risking', 'child', 'had', 'incredulously', 'dumb', 'plot', 'Ballistic', ""n't"", 'want', 'provoke', 'anything', 'wise', 'wanted', 'see', 'thought-provoking', 'action', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Inception', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'too', 'fancy', 'lousy', 'scenes', 'where', 'slow-motion', 'one', 'position', 'normal-timed', 'other', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'worst', 'reaction', 'gunshot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Sever', 'shot', 'bad', 'guy', 'arm', 'just', 'dropped', 'side', 'nonchalantly', 'said', 'ouch', 'funny', 'way', 'Dumb', 'got', 'enough', 'explosions', 'gunfights', 'merit', 'kind', 'watchability', 'Too', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'sound', 'fury', 'disguise', 'awful', 'love', 'song', 'end', 'credits']",N/A

726850,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00007CVTH,Eric,"[2, 3]","I'm not typically a particularly demanding moviegoer when it comes to action films; just give me well-choreographed mayhem set amidst a plot that makes a little bit of a sense or a few engaging characters and I'll probably be reasonably pleased. Ballistic fails to follow even that, which explains why the film bored the hell out of me. I'm almost hesitant to say this, but the latest straight-to-video Jean-Claude Van Damme schlock might actually be better than Ballistic, which was arguably 2002's worst film (I've never seen Rollerball).There's something of a plot here, but I'm not entirely sure what the hell was going on. Antonio Banderas plays FBI Agent Ecks, Lucy Liu is Agent Sever, and the two of them are duking it out because they somehow have crossed paths with a wealthy man (Gregg Henry) who is determined to smuggle a small electronic device that can assassinate its intended victim via heart attack. Mixed up in it all is Talisa Soto as Banderas' supposedly dead wife, only she's not really dead. Much mayhen ensues.Ballistic is directed by Kaos, a Thai filmmaker who apparently wanted his movies to live up to his name. This is his first American feature and he shows almost no ability in crafting an action sequence. Martial arts fights that should get the adrenaline-pumping are so stiltedly choreographed, it'll inspire either laughs or yawns. Kaos also goes overboard on the slow motion, ensuring there's never an opportunity for the fight scenes to build momentum. And this is the only film I can think of where the people involved in a car chase actually follow the speed limit!I feel a bit sorry for the cast here, particularly Lucy Liu, whose martial arts talents are squandered here. To date, she hasn't been much of an actress, but she looks and convincingly acts tough so such a role here must have seemed like a good idea.

726851,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00007CVTH,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 3]","Jeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas) is a former FBI agent who is haunted by the ""supposed"" death of his wife. He remains mentally tortured even as he continues on to investigate deaths and criminals. Sever (Lucy Liu) is a Chinese government agent who is calm, calculated, and deadly. Do you recognize what's wrong here? If you've guessed already that these two characters are horribly clich&eacute;d, then you're on the right track...unfortunately. Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is basically an action film that is devoid of any originality. From the uninspiring plot to the nonstop action sequences, it's no surprise that this film was poorly received at the time of its premiere. The story itself is nothing special: a child is kidnapped, Sever blows stuff up, Ecks wants to know if his monotonous-sounding wife is still alive, more stuff blows up, the villain tries too hard to be like a REAL villain, more and more stuff blows up, blah blah blah, final confrontation, blah blah blah, happy ending, the end. The director, whose full name I won't even bother to correctly pronounce, could have at least put some effort into the plot. But hey, it's an action film, right? Who cares about the story when it's all about the big guns, car chases, and loud explosions?Now, usually I do enjoy watching action films, as long as it keeps me awake throughout. And I will admit that sometimes I ignore the plot and just immerse myself into the awesomeness of the gunfights and explosions. The Rock and the first two Predator films can be good examples of this. But with Ballistic, it's a different story. While the film doesn't succeed in giving an intriguing story, it makes matters worse by succeeding in giving weak and tedious action. There are a number of problems involving the gunfights. None of the characters look as if their adrenaline is at a high level. The cameras are sometimes too distant from where the action is taking place. Sever is fired at multiple times and is never hit by a single bullet, resulting in a lack of a sense of jeopardy towards the character. Some of the choreography is a bit off, especially during the fight between Sever and A.J. Ross (Ray Park). And what's worse than dull action scenes? Playing loud techno music in the middle of all of this so-called pandemonium. It looks like the creators didn't realize that it has ""clich&eacute;"" written all over it. But the worst part about the soundtrack that it's mostly inappropriately placed. For example, The Crystal Method's ""Name of the Game"" is played when special agents remain quiet as they try to figure out the actual location of their enemy when a smoke grenade is set off. This really ruins the suspense, which is ironic since there's no suspense whatsoever in this entire film. And speaking of music, there's a female voice that just goes ""ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh"" from beginning to end. I do enjoy this sort of vocal music in any type of film. However, this woman gives a poor performance: she's out of tune all the time. It's more annoying than hypnotic.But what about the characters? Well, they're your basic archetypes: tortured hero, calm and calculated heroine, heartless villain, etc. Most of them are forgettable, since they're pretty much unlikable. And the actors? Let's just say that they don't seem to care themselves. They just say their lines as if they're reading off cue cards. Talisa Soto (as Rayne Gant) is the worst of the bunch, since she doesn't say a single line with a bit of conviction. Plus, her accent is more of a disturbance when she speaks (no offense). How did she survive the audition, anyway?If there's anything that's good about this film, I will admit that there are two scenes that I found quite satisfying. There is a scene in which a pair of automobiles flip over and crash on the asphalt. Out of all the action sequences in this movie, this one is quite breathtaking to watch. And then, there's a scene that is set in an aquarium. It's a decent-looking environment, with the entire place being beautifully lit.According to the Rotten Tomatoes website, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever has a 0% rating among critics. This is considered to be the worst of the worst in the 2000's. I wouldn't consider this film to be the absolute worst of the decade, but it could very well be a runner-up. With an uninteresting plot, underwhelming action scenes, annoying music, and wooden performances, this movie isn't even worthy of a Saturday-night rental. This could be a treat for those who enjoy watching poorly-directed action films.Grade: 2.8 out of 10",2,This is what happens when you fail Action Film 101,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,4549,"['Jeremiah', 'Ecks', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'former', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'haunted', 'supposed', 'death', 'wife', 'mentally', 'tortured', 'even', 'investigate', 'deaths', 'criminals', 'Sever', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Chinese', 'government', 'agent', 'who', 'calm', 'calculated', 'deadly', 'Do', 'recognize', 'what', 'wrong', 'here', ""'ve"", 'guessed', 'already', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'horribly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'then', ""'re"", 'right', 'track', 'unfortunately', 'Ballistic', 'Ecks', 'vs', 'Sever', 'basically', 'action', 'film', 'devoid', 'originality', 'uninspiring', 'plot', 'nonstop', 'action', 'sequences', 'surprise', 'film', 'was', 'poorly', 'received', 'time', 'premiere', 'story', 'nothing', 'special', 'child', 'kidnapped', 'Sever', 'stuff', 'up', 'Ecks', 'know', 'monotonous-sounding', 'wife', 'still', 'alive', 'more', 'stuff', 'up', 'villain', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'REAL', 'villain', 'more', 'more', 'stuff', 'up', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'final', 'confrontation', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'happy', 'ending', 'end', 'director', 'full', 'name', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'correctly', 'pronounce', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'put', 'effort', 'plot', 'action', 'film', 'right', 'Who', 'story', 'when', 'big', 'guns', 'car', 'chases', 'loud', 'explosions', 'Now', 'usually', 'do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'action', 'films', 'as', 'long', 'awake', 'will', 'admit', 'sometimes', 'ignore', 'plot', 'just', 'immerse', 'awesomeness', 'gunfights', 'explosions', 'Rock', 'first', 'two', 'Predator', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'examples', 'Ballistic', 'different', 'story', 'film', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'giving', 'intriguing', 'story', 'matters', 'worse', 'succeeding', 'giving', 'weak', 'tedious', 'action', 'are', 'number', 'problems', 'involving', 'gunfights', 'None', 'characters', 'look', 'adrenaline', 'high', 'level', 'cameras', 'are', 'sometimes', 'too', 'distant', 'where', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'Sever', 'fired', 'multiple', 'times', 'never', 'hit', 'single', 'bullet', 'resulting', 'lack', 'sense', 'jeopardy', 'character', 'choreography', 'bit', 'off', 'especially', 'fight', 'Sever', 'A.J', 'Ross', 'Ray', 'Park', 'what', 'worse', 'dull', 'action', 'scenes', 'Playing', 'loud', 'techno', 'music', 'middle', 'so-called', 'pandemonium', 'creators', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'clich', 'eacute', 'written', 'worst', 'part', 'soundtrack', 'mostly', 'inappropriately', 'placed', 'example', 'Crystal', 'Method', 'Name', 'Game', 'played', 'when', 'special', 'agents', 'remain', 'quiet', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'actual', 'location', 'enemy', 'when', 'smoke', 'grenade', 'set', 'off', 'really', 'suspense', 'ironic', 'suspense', 'whatsoever', 'entire', 'film', 'speaking', 'music', 'female', 'voice', 'just', 'ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh', 'beginning', 'end', 'do', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'vocal', 'music', 'type', 'film', 'However', 'woman', 'poor', 'performance', 'tune', 'time', 'more', 'annoying', 'hypnotic.But', 'what', 'characters', 'Well', ""'re"", 'basic', 'archetypes', 'tortured', 'hero', 'calm', 'calculated', 'heroine', 'heartless', 'villain', 'etc', 'Most', 'are', 'forgettable', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'unlikable', 'actors', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'just', 'say', 'lines', ""'re"", 'reading', 'off', 'cue', 'cards', 'Talisa', 'Soto', 'Rayne', 'Gant', 'worst', 'bunch', ""n't"", 'say', 'single', 'line', 'bit', 'conviction', 'accent', 'more', 'disturbance', 'when', 'offense', 'How', 'did', 'survive', 'audition', 'anyway', 'anything', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'admit', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'found', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'scene', 'pair', 'automobiles', 'flip', 'crash', 'asphalt', 'action', 'movie', 'one', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'watch', 'then', 'scene', 'set', 'aquarium', 'decent-looking', 'environment', 'entire', 'place', 'being', 'beautifully', 'lit.According', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'website', 'Ballistic', 'Ecks', 'vs', 'Sever', '0', '%', 'rating', 'critics', 'considered', 'be', 'worst', 'worst', '2000', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'absolute', 'worst', 'decade', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'runner-up', 'uninteresting', 'plot', 'underwhelming', 'action', 'scenes', 'annoying', 'music', 'wooden', 'performances', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'worthy', 'Saturday-night', 'rental', 'could', 'be', 'treat', 'who', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'poorly-directed', 'action', 'films.Grade', '2.8', '10']",N/A

It just a massive load of old cobblers. And what's even worse is that the nonexistent plot is full of holes. Make sense? No didn't think so. It's not even worth watching to see what I mean.The dialogue is the truly worst ever. At least the bad dialogue in movies such as Dolemite is eternally quotable. Ray Park's acting makes Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal on their worst day look like Laurence Olivier. The 'action' is so basic it feels like a made for video production, it lacks anything resembling sophistication and excitement.I'm surprised Alan B. McElroy wrote this. He's done some good stuff (Wrong Turn, Spawn Animated Series) but this must have been something he wrote without much inspiration. Every writer comes up with a turkey but WHAT a turkey this is.

It's essentially a movie as ridiculous as its title - which just happens to be the reason why I avoided this garbage for nearly a decade.Ecks (Banderas) is a semi-retired FBI agent picked up by some kind of shadow government that also happens to be DIA, linked to Canadian officials, sort of, who kidnap female Chinese orphans - insert Lucy Liu - to create special agent assassins, or something.  Thrown into the mix is a woman married to two men, a child being held for personal ransom, and some imaginary top secret, microscopic computer hardware that can induce heart attacks or embolisms.  When there is no empathy for a woman whose child has been abducted, you know the movie is complete chaos.  Speaking of that...The director of this trainwreck is named Kaos, a pseudonym presumably used because he feels guilty that the plot and direction of this film resembles the consistency of diarrhea.  This movie is laughably bad.  Way too little back story, far too few details for character development, there simply isn't anything developed.  And when explanations are given, they are delivered through slow-mo camera shots and three word sentences.Aside from a couple explosions - which are completely contrived and unconvincing - there is nearly nothing redeemable about this movie.

Lots of silly action movies are great, I don't concern myself with realism or much plot, I like explosions and I love Lucy Lui.  This had lots of thing blowing up and lots of Lucy (although overdressed I thought), so why was this so brain numbingly bad?  I believe it was the fundamental cluelessness of the writers and directors.  The idea behind this mess was so incredibly stupid as to make me do a double take when I heard it.  It seems the bad guy has developed ""the ultimate killing machine""  Why?  Because he wanted to circumvent ""The Human Factor"" a machine would not hesitate like a human would (of course a machine would not know who to kill or when without a human but never mind that).  Lucy is one of those mystical Asians who is trained in some bazaar flavor of martial art which enables her to disappear or to walk around with a machine gun and not be seen etc.  The crime here is that this moron ""Kahos"" or something, the director, thinks this hokum is serious and treats in as such with many, many tedious scenes of characters in slow motion standing in front of explosions (There are lots of explosions) for no reason.  When not blowing things up they are forced to recite page after page of mind numbing psychobable laying out this absurd history.  Ecker (Sever, I can't remember who was who) has an ex wife who marries the bad guy has a kid  says ""I am his wife I. name only blah blah blah.  Lui was from China, a girl (They don't want girls over there) so she was put in the top secret Chinese explosion, gun unit of the blah blah blah...  When you thought the film could not get any stupider,  it does climax fight in one of those steam and flame factories, you know the ones, they don't have employees or manufacture anything but there is lots of steam and flame jumping out of nowhere ends with Lucy Lui revealing, I believe, that she could have stopped this mess long ago with the touch of a button, of course we would have been spared this horrible film.  The cops show up in force after all the action has ended (ALA Batman, the TV series, which is much more believable).  Also Lucy Lui kidnaps a child in the beginning, we are not sure why, she just does, the little tike spends days in a cage and never seems to mind, or have to go to the bathroom or anything....perhaps he is silently thankful he is in the cage and not in the theater.

726857,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B00007CVTH,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[2, 4]","I'd like to open my review with a prediction: in a few years' time, Ballistic: Echs vs. Sever will gain a cult following, either with viewers who appreciate ""bad cinema,"" or action junkies who love its sheer over-the-topness.  This movie was dumped on beyond belief upon its release, and it's hard to understand why.  After all, it's no worse than the other action drek Hollywood churns out.  The fact that films like ""XXX"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" can be enjoyed as mindless fun, yet Ballistic, which itself is also nothing but candy-flossed entertainment, is derided, boggles my mind.Viewers who enjoy Hong Kong/Asian cinema (""Hard Boiled"" and ""Shiri"" especially) won't have as much trouble enjoying Ballistic as others appear to.  I've noticed the main thing people complain about in Ballistic are the unanswered questions and the sometimes outrageousness of the action sequences (i.e., Lucy Liu blasting apart a whole city and not getting a scratch).  These sort of things are common place in Hong Kong action cinema, but whereas those movies are appreciated regardless, apparently Ballistic must face tougher criticism, because it is, of course, a Hollywood movie.  How hypocritical!Like most, I read the many negative reviews for this movie.  I figured it probably wasn't any good, and didn't plan to see it.  But then, as I kept reading all of the negative reviews, I began to wonder if Ballistic really WAS so bad.  So I rented it, just to find out.  Not expecting to enjoy the movie at all, I was surprised to find that it was much better than the ""professional"" and amateur critics would have you believe.Ballistic: Echs vs. Sever, even though it has a terrible name, is the logical progression of action movies.  Plot, character development, realism, and explanations are chucked aside for well-filmed shoot-outs, explosions, and stunts.  Sylvester Stallone once remarked that the perfect action movie would be devoid of dialog; like the old silent films, it would use moving images and action to propel the story.  Ballistic is pretty close; it's all action, all the time.  The last half hour of the movie is the final battle itself.Cast-wise, the actors do fairly well.  Lucy Liu has only a handful of lines, but comes off cool and deadly as the sexy assassin.  She displays a modicum of emotions, and if you check out the documentary, you'll laugh at how exuberant and giggly the real Lucy Liu is, when compared to the ice cold cube she portrays in the film.  Antonio Banderas is for once subdued, which is a shame.  I was hoping for a few laughably-bad deliveries and pronunciations, as he treated viewers to in ""Assassins.""  Kaos, the director, is straight out of John Woo's school for directing: lots of slo-mo explosions and sweeping shots.  Considering how terribly Ballistic bombed in theaters, I wonder if he'll get the chance to direct a Hollywood feature again.All told, Ballistic is an enjoyable treat for movie fans who like their action movies the old-fashioned way: lots of gunfire, a hokey story, some explosions, actors doing their own stunts, and a healthy lack of computer graphics.  That's probably the main reason to recommend Ballistic; unlike most recent action movies that shove lame CGI down our throats (CGI which will no doubt look dated in a few years), Ballistic actually features real-life stunts which certainly placed the actors in jeopardy.",4,The logical progression of action cinema,1042156800,"01 10, 2003",2003,3383,"[""'d"", 'like', 'open', 'review', 'prediction', 'few', 'years', 'time', 'Ballistic', 'Echs', 'vs', 'Sever', 'will', 'gain', 'cult', 'following', 'either', 'viewers', 'who', 'appreciate', 'bad', 'cinema', 'action', 'junkies', 'who', 'love', 'sheer', 'over-the-topness', 'movie', 'was', 'dumped', 'belief', 'release', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'worse', 'other', 'action', 'drek', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'fact', 'films', 'XXX', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'mindless', 'fun', 'yet', 'Ballistic', 'also', 'nothing', 'candy-flossed', 'entertainment', 'derided', 'boggles', 'mind.Viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Hong', 'Kong/Asian', 'cinema', 'Hard', 'Boiled', 'Shiri', 'especially', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'trouble', 'enjoying', 'Ballistic', 'others', 'appear', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'main', 'thing', 'people', 'complain', 'Ballistic', 'are', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'sometimes', 'outrageousness', 'action', 'sequences', 'i.e.', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'blasting', 'apart', 'whole', 'city', 'not', 'getting', 'scratch', 'sort', 'things', 'are', 'common', 'place', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'cinema', 'whereas', 'movies', 'are', 'appreciated', 'regardless', 'apparently', 'Ballistic', 'must', 'face', 'tougher', 'criticism', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'How', 'hypocritical', 'most', 'read', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'figured', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'see', 'then', 'kept', 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'began', 'wonder', 'Ballistic', 'really', 'WAS', 'so', 'bad', 'rented', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'Not', 'expecting', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'professional', 'amateur', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'believe.Ballistic', 'Echs', 'vs', 'Sever', 'even', 'terrible', 'name', 'logical', 'progression', 'action', 'movies', 'Plot', 'character', 'development', 'realism', 'explanations', 'are', 'chucked', 'aside', 'well-filmed', 'shoot-outs', 'explosions', 'stunts', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'once', 'remarked', 'perfect', 'action', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'devoid', 'dialog', 'old', 'silent', 'films', 'would', 'use', 'moving', 'images', 'action', 'propel', 'story', 'Ballistic', 'pretty', 'close', 'action', 'time', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'final', 'battle', 'itself.Cast-wise', 'actors', 'do', 'fairly', 'well', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'only', 'handful', 'lines', 'off', 'cool', 'deadly', 'sexy', 'assassin', 'modicum', 'emotions', 'check', 'out', 'documentary', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'how', 'exuberant', 'giggly', 'real', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'when', 'compared', 'ice', 'cold', 'cube', 'film', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'once', 'subdued', 'shame', 'was', 'hoping', 'few', 'laughably-bad', 'deliveries', 'pronunciations', 'treated', 'viewers', 'Assassins', 'Kaos', 'director', 'straight', 'John', 'Woo', 'school', 'directing', 'lots', 'slo-mo', 'explosions', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'Considering', 'how', 'terribly', 'Ballistic', 'bombed', 'theaters', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'get', 'chance', 'direct', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'again.All', 'told', 'Ballistic', 'enjoyable', 'treat', 'movie', 'fans', 'who', 'like', 'action', 'movies', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'lots', 'gunfire', 'hokey', 'story', 'explosions', 'actors', 'doing', 'own', 'stunts', 'healthy', 'lack', 'computer', 'graphics', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'recommend', 'Ballistic', 'most', 'recent', 'action', 'movies', 'shove', 'lame', 'CGI', 'down', 'throats', 'CGI', 'will', 'doubt', 'look', 'dated', 'few', 'years', 'Ballistic', 'actually', 'real-life', 'stunts', 'certainly', 'placed', 'actors', 'jeopardy']",N/A

This is not the type of movie that I particularly go out of my way for but since it came with high praise from a trusted source and has Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu in it, I jumped right in.  As fortune would have it, it's only an hour and a half long which is one of this movies precious few saving graces.  Another huge saving grace for this ""film"" is the casting of Ray Park, an actor whose martial arts skills are quite noteworthy.  Perhaps you might not be familiar with his name or previous works, most notably of which was Darth Maul in ""Star Wars Episode I, The Phantom Menace and in the first X-Men movie as Toad.The premise:Quick and ""simple,"" Sever, played by Lucy Liu, is a DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) agent who for very good reasons has decided to turn her considerable talents against her boss.  This attention is manifested through her kidnapping her ""boss's"" son.  In comes Ecks, played somewhat blandly by Antonio Banderas, who is a former FBI Special agent.  He is coerced by his former lead agent into participating in the search for Sever and the kidnapped child.What follows from there is, as stated above, a film predicated by well worn clich&eacute; and an overbearing soundtrack.  While not leaving one feeling as if they've wasted an hour and a half of their life, it does leave one wondering about Antonio Banderas' decision making process when it comes to the films he's been choosing over the last few years.

726863,A1BE9BAF6CDNI8,B00007CVTH,LadyT,"[5, 7]","Yep, I saw all of the reviews about how bad this movie was before I purchased it but figured, what the heck, I like action films and I like Banderas so why not give it a try?  Well, hubby and I took three days to finish watching this movie.  No, nothing was wrong with our DVD player, it's just that we kept falling asleep on it.  There's nothing about the movie that kept our eyes glued to the television screen for lengthy periods.What's good?  If you like action, there's a lot of it here.  Crashing cars, car and motorcycle chases, explosions, shoot'em ups, and lots of fighting are sprinkled liberally throughout the movie.What's bad?  Most of the action seems mindless, and the movie plays like a wannabe movie.  (They wanted it to be something that it isn't.)  There is a plot and you can follow it, but some of the action seems overlong or present just to extend the time of the movie or maybe because they figured the action would draw in the moviegoers who would forget about all else.With some of the fighting and clothing, I got a glimpse of the Matrix -- much lower scale mind you, but the Matrix came to mind nonetheless.  With the motorcycle chase scene, Mission Impossible II came to mind.  Again, the scenes here are nowhere near the quality of Mission Impossible, but it came to mind too.The acting is decent but none of it will pull you in and make you really care for the story being told. This could be because of the dialog -- it was okay but the actors didn't have a whole lot to work with.Overall, while the movie wasn't horrible I wish I'd rented it instead of buying it because it's one that I have no desire to watch again.  On a lighter note, my husband and I did have a good time laughing at the various scenes (which weren't supposed to be funny) and calling out the movies that this one copied parts from.

Simply because I remember when I first read a review for this film when I delivering papers back in 2002 and the review for it was so hilarious, I though ""Wow!  I gotta see this film!""  It took me 8yrs to see it b/c I wasn't willing to shell out the cash to see it, and I don't count Instant Watch on Netflix as shelling out cash, which is where I saw it.  The problem is, this film isn't nearly as hilariously bad as the review made this film sound.I am not a fan of Banderas or Liu, but what drew me to this was its so-called stupidity, and while there is plenty of that, it is not on calliber with some idiot films that I have had the pleasure of viewing such as ""Troll 2"", ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", or even ""The Apple"".  Its just too earnest for its own good, and that's the problem with this film; it insist on playing it straight and trying to have a plot.  This movie would have been a hell of a lot better if it just dropped the plot and was non-stop explosions because I am just guessing the writers were not capable of even making the most out of an incoherrent script, ie. making it in to a laughably bad movie.The effects are good and I will give it that, but the movie just tries too hard to be serious, I wish I could actually tell you the plot, but honestly, I could not discern the plot and the characters, at times, spoke so low, I couldn't understand them (though this may be more a problem with the version on net flix than anything else), so I gave up trying to figure out the plot and just used it as background noise.  The fight scenes are semi-entertaining and had there been more of those and less talking, or had been campy, it would have gotten a much higher rating from me, but it just wasn't very entertaining overall.Overall, if you want something as background noise, you can't go wrong, but if you want something that makes sense, or something that doesn't make sense but is still entertaining, don't rent this film.  Okay, I will give it this, the acting is pretty bad sometimes, laughably so, more because the movie tries to be serious and its just so damn hilarious, so in this way, I did get some enjoyment out of it.  ;P  But I wish it had more explosions than it did, it didn't have enough.God Bless ~Amy",2,I Wish I Could Rate it Higher...,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,2310,"['really', 'really', 'wanted', 'Ecks', 'vs', 'Sever', 'Why', 'may', 'ask', 'Simply', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'review', 'film', 'when', 'delivering', 'papers', 'back', '2002', 'review', 'was', 'so', 'hilarious', 'Wow', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'film', 'took', '8yrs', 'see', 'b/c', 'was', ""n't"", 'willing', 'shell', 'out', 'cash', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'Instant', 'Watch', 'Netflix', 'shelling', 'out', 'cash', 'where', 'saw', 'problem', 'film', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'hilariously', 'bad', 'review', 'made', 'film', 'sound.I', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Banderas', 'Liu', 'what', 'drew', 'was', 'so-called', 'stupidity', 'plenty', 'not', 'calliber', 'idiot', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'such', 'Troll', '2', 'Plan', '9', 'Outer', 'Space', 'even', 'Apple', 'just', 'too', 'earnest', 'own', 'good', 'problem', 'film', 'insist', 'playing', 'straight', 'trying', 'have', 'plot', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hell', 'lot', 'better', 'just', 'dropped', 'plot', 'was', 'non-stop', 'explosions', 'am', 'just', 'guessing', 'writers', 'were', 'not', 'capable', 'even', 'making', 'most', 'incoherrent', 'script', 'ie', 'making', 'laughably', 'bad', 'movie.The', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'serious', 'wish', 'could', 'actually', 'tell', 'plot', 'honestly', 'could', 'not', 'discern', 'plot', 'characters', 'times', 'spoke', 'so', 'low', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'problem', 'version', 'net', 'flix', 'anything', 'else', 'gave', 'up', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'plot', 'just', 'used', 'background', 'noise', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'semi-entertaining', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'less', 'talking', 'had', 'been', 'campy', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'much', 'higher', 'rating', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'entertaining', 'overall.Overall', 'want', 'something', 'background', 'noise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'want', 'something', 'sense', 'something', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'still', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'film', 'Okay', 'will', 'give', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'sometimes', 'laughably', 'so', 'more', 'movie', 'be', 'serious', 'just', 'so', 'damn', 'hilarious', 'so', 'way', 'did', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'P', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'explosions', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

The overblown title is symptomatic of the movie itself. It's hard to figure out how the filmmakers managed to put in so many gunfights, explosions and chases, yet come up with so little excitement. It all adds up to zero.What there is of a plot is nonsensical and banal. Ecks [Antonio Banderas] is a secret agent who believes his wife has been murdered by some nefarious group. He thinks his arch nemesis is another spy named Sever [Lucy Lui], but, of course, she turns out to be an ally. On and on this drivel goes, with one ridiculous plot twist after another. We stop caring which way the story goes after about thirty minutes because there is not a single character we can possibly care about.One always wonders how any movie can wind up being this bad. Whether a film's budget is one million dollars or one hundred million, one assumes that its makers' original intention was to produce something that's at least watchable. Often, everything goes amiss, and the result is a bomb. Still, it's rare that a movie is as big a bomb as this one. Sometimes, such a movie is so bad that it's good.

No movie with Lucy Liu in it could ever warrant a ZERO STAR RATING FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!I will agree that the film's plot exists only to perpetutate the action, which consists of motorcycle chases, blazin' gun wars, and several great martial arts battles, which include the opening sequence, in which the Chinese &quot;good&quot; assasin Sever (Lucy Liu) &quot;kidnaps&quot; her ex-employer's son, a sequence during which Sever beats the bejesus out of Agent Jeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas), whose searching for information on his &quot;deceased&quot; wife, and the final fight, in which Sever takes on Ross, whose after a new &quot;invention&quot; she has hidden, and who is played by none other than the great Ray Park!Notice how many quotation marks I used there? That could explain some of the film's unpopulartiy. By the halfway point, BALLISTIC:ECKS VS SEVER has had so many plot twists, it makes THE SIXTH SENSE's one big big plot twist look silly (well, okay, let's not go nuts here, but you get the idea.)I am not an especially big fan of Antonio Banderas, but he comes across as a good male lead. It was really Lucy Liu that drew me to this film. Trust me, she is the only one of CHARLIE'S ANGELS who is a REAL martial artist, and she gets her chance to prove it this time around, with none of the over-the-top, pushing-the-envelope type of wire-fu (I'm looking at you, FULL THROTTLE)Basically, BALLISTIC:ECKS VS SEVER is not half as bad as it is made out to be. Anyone looking for some good action should check it out, and you'll love to see Lucy Liu throwin' some real nice high kicks and just looking like a beautiful ANGEL.

Two of the best Hollywood favorites today, Antonio Banderas (""The Mask of Zorro"") and Lucy Liu (""Charlie's Angels"") team up to bring this adrenaline-pumping action-thriller to the big screen. And also the work of first-time director Wych Kaosayananda was extraordinary! ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"" focuses on a grief-ridden former FBI agent named Jeremiah Ecks (Banderas). Ecks is brought back to the service by his long-time comrade (Miguel Sandoval) to investigate a serious threat in the form of a deadly rogue operative named Sever (Liu). The thing, to Ecks, about tracking down Sever is that she might hold the answer's to his wife's (Talisa Soto) mysterious death. Or is she even dead at all?? As the movie progresses, Ecks and Sever team up to take down the bad guys as well as fighting their way through a murky world of shadow agents. You see, Lucy Liu's role of Sever was originally written for a man. But the director thought it would be more interesting to cast a woman for the part--yet leave the script unchanged. The fight scenes in the film were choreographed with no flaws whatsoever, especially the scene when Lucy Liu was beating those cops senseless with those retractable metal rods of hers. To me, she's like a Charlie's Angel without that faceless, intercom-speaking Charlie (I wouldn't be surprised at all if they didn't show his face again in ""Charlie's Angels 2"", but that's another story). But anyway, in conclusion, this film has it all! Great performances from Banderas and Liu, a stellar supporting cast including Gregg Henry (""Payback"") and Ray Park (""Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace"", ""X-Men"", upcoming ""X-Men 2""), and action after action after action all the way from explosive start to explosive finish!

You have a male Latin lead with an Asian female lead, and ""the white guys"" are the bad guys. That's why people didn't like this movie. There were some great action scenes in this film, a great soundtrack, charismatic actors and a story line that didn't get in the way of the action.

While I'm certainly not going to defend the movie, I have to say that, like most movies about which things like this are said, this isn't even the worst movie I've seen this week (both Bled and The Bone Snatcher were quite a bit worse than this), but ""real"" critics (i.e., the ones who get paid for doing this) never end up seeing stuff like that, so for them, this represents the bottom of the barrel. There are times when I envy them. Most recently, while I was watching Bled and The Bone Snatcher.I'd try to give you some idea of a plot here, but there's really no reason. What this movie is really about is Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu running around and blowing things up. Why this should surprise anyone is entirely beyond me, given that both of them made their names doing exactly this sort of thing, though even Desperado had a stronger storyline to it than this does. But really, if you're going to see a movie like this for plot, story, and character development, you're probably in the wrong place. This is all about things blowing up, and as far as that goes, it does deliver.

After watching it I still don't know what it's about exactly, but do know why the film was utterly panned by the critics and public alike.The entire movie serves as a setup for exploding vehicles, governmental interagency rivalry, gunplay, kidnapping, and uber-dangerous secret weapons. The film was made in Canada, and the low budget shows up everywhere from the special effects to the acting, and certainly in the script. Directed by ""Kaos"" (""Chaos"" is more like it, though his real name is Wych Kaosayananda) in his American big screen debut, the film centers around kidnapping and killing family members, and initially pits FBI hero Jeremiah Ecks (Banderas) against agent Sever (Liu) a rogue agent of a mystery agency that has a very confusing role in the government. Regardless, they both realize they are on the same side and turn their wrath against a murderous and traitorous common enemy, Robert Gant (Gregg Henry), finding ample reason to increase the body count at random intervals.The plot is unfathomable, people do things for pointless reasons, and at the end of the movie nobody cares. The soundtrack is pretentious, intrusive, and annoying, the pace is ponderous (despite the explosions and gunfire), and the entire family angle is utterly unconvincing or in any way sensible.

Zwick,"[1, 3]","""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"" has been saddled with not only one of the worst movie titles in recent memory, but one of the worst screenplays as well.  The film's third-rate espionage plot makes no sense at all and serves basically as a [weak] excuse for endless explosions, shootouts and double-flipping car chases, which have become the standard accoutrements for virtually every action picture since ""Bullitt"" in 1968.The problem with ""Ballistic"" is that the viewer can never tell who is doing what to whom or why - and we never care.  The film is really all about style anyway.  How else to account for the rather ludicrous image of Lucy Liu - looking more like a fashion model out on a shoot than a trained killer doing the shooting herself  - strolling in elegant slow motion through the streets of Vancouver, wiping out what seems to be an entire hit squad with a combination of superhuman marksmanship and Matrix-like kickboxing moves?  With her ankle-length designer coat and her icy-cool demeanor, she looks like Calvin Klein's idea of what the well-dressed assassin should be wearing this season.  It's enough to reduce the whole enterprise to the level of comic absurdity - and, indeed, I often found myself laughing out loud at many of the ostensibly serious shenanigans occurring in the film.  The flashbacks, which are obviously intended to clarify the characters' relationships, are so poorly done that they actually end up making the whole story more muddled and confusing. (And, although the child-kidnapping scenario is never as offensive in this film as it is in ""Trapped,"" one can still question the propriety of filmmakers running to this theme with the kind of frequency they seem to have been doing of late).Antonio Banderas makes up the other half of the film's title (he is Ecks, she Sever), and one only wonders what he could have been thinking about when he signed on to co-star in this particular project.

Sipos,"[10, 14]","I can't believe that only two years after the big hit, Charlie's Angels, Lucy Liu appeared in this made-in-Canada cheapie.The story is nonsensical and confusing.  The DVD's description says Liu is an NSA agent, but she's with the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency), sort of.I say ""sort of,"" because the movie's DIA is not the US Pentagon's DIA, but apparently some ""shadow government"" in Canada that hires Chinese orphans (girls abandoned by their parents in China due to China's ""one child"" policy), to be ruthless assassins.  The characters in the movie talk of a ""shadow goverment"" and the film is set in Canada, with Canadian cops chasing people, so I guess they mean a Canadian ""shadow government.""However, this ""shadow government"" is legitamate.  We know this, because they get cooperation from the police in trying to kill rogue assassin Lucy Liu.  Only, this ""shadow government"" is also evil and illegitamite, because some FBI people, linked to the Canadian police or DIA or whoever, force ex-FBI agent Antonio Banderas out of retirement to find a child that Lucy Liu kidnapped.Confusing, no?In the Special Features, the director says, ""In my research, I found that there really is a DIA.""  Clearly, neither he nor the writer have a clue as to what the DIA is.  It's a branch of the Pentagon primarily concerned with military intelligence.Lucy Liu's assassin dresses in Lara Croft fashion, walking the streets of Vancouver in spandex and a cape.  In the Special Feature, Liu says she was intrigued that the assassin was a woman, because it added ""a whole other dimension"" to the role.What other dimension?  The screen has been full of ass-kicking lady spies since The Avenger's Emma Peel, yet people still talk as if it's a new thing.The special effects are okay but mostly the usual, with the exception of a police sniper falling onto a car roof.  Well shot.One movie cliche that really annoys me is when you have scores of highly trained troops or snipers blasting away and hitting nothing.  Then the hero (or heroine) steps out and blasts them all away.  Liu's knocking off dozens of people and not a bullet grazes here.Anyway, she turns out to be a good assassin who's only trying to kill the head of DIA (or whoever he is) because her kid got killed in a DIA mission gone bad.I rented this film because it has Talisa Soto, my second-favorite Bond girl.

726896,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00007CVTH,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","&quot;Ballistic -- Ecks vs. Sever,&quot; the most unappealing title of recent years, has still an appealing element in Lucy Liu; many people might want to see her give a kick or two to bad guys.  Well, you can see some good action scenes (though heavily edited) in which she shows some good martial arts stunts.  It is a sad thing, however, thatA) you have no reasonable story.B) you don't get in fact many actions from Ms. Liu.C) and you see the worst performance from Antonio Banderas in his career.Sorry to say that, but it's true.  Banderas plays an ex FBI agent Ecks, whom you first find drunk, as usual, and who had a wife and kid in the past ... as usual.  And Lucy Liu is some secret agent Sever who was trained for special mission or something, as you know, and she now works alone ... well, as you know.  Anyway, Sever kidnaps a boy of the boss of some government organization DIA (Greg Henry), and the event, which should have been made with much exciting shots, is followed by many, many gunshots and explosions in Vancouver.The film looks like a bad Hong-Kong actioner, in which no coherent story is given.  There are several surprisingly memorable shots, but they are not many, and most of all, it is painful to watch that these two leading stars, especially Banderas who seems exhaused, (and ill-used Ray Park, &quot;Episode I&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;) look very tired and uninterested.  Even a kidnapped boy looks tired too, as if he wants to go home, home of his own.I heard the director Wych Kaosayananda, born in Thailand, made a hit there with his previous film &quot;Fah,&quot; which led to this English-speaking film.  I don't know, but the film must have shown some promising thing in it.  And I admit some stunts are good in his second film.
