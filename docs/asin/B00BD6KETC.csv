As a pretty big fan of the first 6 seasons (and as someone who also happens to live in Santa Barbara County), my wife and I have been very disappointed with Season 7 for several reasons thus far...here's why:#1 - A constant stream of sexual innuendo.  It seems like the writers are running out of fresh ideas and so have resorted to a radical and very noticeable increase in cheap, unfunny innuendo.  Sean and Gus have gone from cute and amusingly immature to vulgar and crudely immature.  Please, get back to the Sean and Gus we enjoy so much. Also, Sean and Jules moving in together is not romantic.  I know this is considered acceptable in today's world, but it's frankly, offensive to others.#2 - Sean has always been immature, like a grown up kid, who often handles difficult situations with a charming, but awkward childishness - with wit and odd humor, but he is becoming, quite honestly, more of a jerk. The charm is fast being replaced by grating and bizarre version of the old Sean who needs to just learn to shut up.#3 - The first couple of episodes have transformed from the creativity of past Psych episodes into the bizarre and almost psychotic.  This is PSYCH guys, NOT PSYCHotic.#4 - We miss the amusing convulsions or ""fits"" that Sean used to display when he had his Psychic visions in earlier seasons...and the more visual clues given by the camera showing us those unique observations which Sean picked up on that every one else missed.If Season 7 continues along this line, my wife and I plan to stop watching. Now, in a world that is fast losing its discernment, and that is quickly embracing the irrational, the vulgar and the crude as being amusing and normal...these changes to Psyche's past formula may go unnoticed or they may even be welcomed by some...but not by others...even if we are in a minority.Oh, and one quick note that has nothing to do with the declining quality of the show (IMHO), is an interesting tidbit about Santa Barbara.  The city where Lassy's girlfriend is imprisoned, Lompoc (pronounced ""Lom-poke"" and NOT ""Lom-pock"") does not have a prison for women.  There are many such inconsistencies between the real county of Santa Barbara and the fake Santa Barbara County of Psych.  NOTE:  This does not lessen my enjoyment of the show, but living in this area, we note that MOST of the overhead shots and a few street shots are from Santa Barbara and the surrounding area...but most ground level shots are clearly from Vancouver where the show is actually filmed).",1,Season 7 Takes a Turn for the Worse,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,2559,"['Thus', 'far', 'Season', '7', 'taken', 'turn', 'worse', 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'first', '6', 'seasons', 'someone', 'who', 'also', 'live', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'County', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Season', '7', 'several', 'reasons', 'thus', 'far', 'here', 'why', '1', 'constant', 'stream', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'writers', 'are', 'running', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'so', 'have', 'resorted', 'radical', 'very', 'noticeable', 'increase', 'cheap', 'unfunny', 'innuendo', 'Sean', 'Gus', 'have', 'gone', 'cute', 'amusingly', 'immature', 'vulgar', 'crudely', 'immature', 'Please', 'get', 'back', 'Sean', 'Gus', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'Also', 'Sean', 'Jules', 'moving', 'together', 'not', 'romantic', 'know', 'considered', 'acceptable', 'today', 'world', 'frankly', 'offensive', 'others.', '2', 'Sean', 'always', 'been', 'immature', 'grown', 'up', 'kid', 'who', 'often', 'difficult', 'situations', 'charming', 'awkward', 'childishness', 'wit', 'odd', 'humor', 'becoming', 'quite', 'honestly', 'more', 'jerk', 'charm', 'fast', 'being', 'replaced', 'grating', 'bizarre', 'version', 'old', 'Sean', 'who', 'just', 'learn', 'shut', 'up.', '3', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'have', 'transformed', 'creativity', 'past', 'Psych', 'bizarre', 'almost', 'psychotic', 'PSYCH', 'guys', 'NOT', 'PSYCHotic.', '4', 'miss', 'amusing', 'convulsions', 'fits', 'Sean', 'used', 'display', 'when', 'had', 'Psychic', 'visions', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'more', 'visual', 'clues', 'given', 'camera', 'showing', 'unique', 'observations', 'Sean', 'picked', 'up', 'one', 'else', 'missed.If', 'Season', '7', 'line', 'wife', 'plan', 'stop', 'watching', 'Now', 'world', 'fast', 'losing', 'discernment', 'quickly', 'embracing', 'irrational', 'vulgar', 'crude', 'being', 'amusing', 'normal', 'changes', 'Psyche', 'past', 'formula', 'may', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'welcomed', 'not', 'others', 'even', 'are', 'minority.Oh', 'one', 'quick', 'note', 'nothing', 'do', 'declining', 'quality', 'show', 'IMHO', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'city', 'where', 'Lassy', 'girlfriend', 'imprisoned', 'Lompoc', 'pronounced', 'Lom-poke', 'NOT', 'Lom-pock', 'not', 'have', 'prison', 'women', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'inconsistencies', 'real', 'county', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'fake', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'County', 'Psych', 'NOTE', 'not', 'lessen', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'living', 'area', 'note', 'MOST', 'overhead', 'shots', 'few', 'street', 'shots', 'are', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'surrounding', 'area', 'most', 'ground', 'level', 'shots', 'are', 'clearly', 'Vancouver', 'where', 'show', 'actually', 'filmed']",Psych: The Complete Seventh Season

Until this season, it has been mostly free of &#34;ugly mouth&#34; (entirely unnecessary use of profanity and ugly expressions that add nothing to the story).  We have been greatly disappointed that this season, there's been a noticeable shift, with several episodes full of just plain nasty words and attitudes.  It has gone from a show where our whole family could watch (we have 10 and 12 year old kids--they aren't preschoolers! and we used to happily all watch the new episode on Amazon on Thursday nights) to one where my husband and I have now decided we now have to pre-watch the episodes, which takes away from the shared experience and potentially causes riots (if we hit some episodes similar to a few that have been shown and have to say &#34;no, you can't watch&#34;).It's frustrating, because the huge uptick in verbal ugliness/nastiness is wholly unnecessary to the advancement of the plot.  Surely Gus and Sean could have a verbal duel without repetitive use of s*ck!  Just shows lack of creativity, which previously had been a hallmark of the show.

The only people who knew Shawn isn't a psychic was gus, his father and know Juliet.  She has tough times handling it, but she sees shawn as a true hero and an excellent detective.  That's one of the major reason why she broke up with him, she reminds me of Rachel Dawes of Batman Begins, when she finds out Bruce Wayne is Batman.  She is an assistant D.A., he is a vigilante and I never understood why she didn't expose him to the cops or arrest him herself.  Same thing with Juliet, she was hurt how come she didn't arrest him or expose him to O'hara or lassiter. Now she treats him like a vigilante. Half of the season, I watched Juliet being hurt when shawn being a fake, some episodes she understood that his fake psychic gave a lot of people hope and something to believe and the people that Shawn helped changed everything in the police department.  Unlike all the cops in here, the reason why Shawn chose to be a P.I. he wants to work his own hours, wear his own clothes and go outside the law catch the bad guys.
