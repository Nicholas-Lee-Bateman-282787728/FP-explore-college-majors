1245915,A2U5K5WNTJWQF2,B00208GIN8,Celestial Lady,"[0, 0]","I was only 10 years old when our school introduced science into the curriculum. Everywhere I looked, I saw an order that implied an ordering force. It was like looking at a magnificent clockworks, and I could sense the clockmaker's hand in producing it. I watched this movie based on the trailer and was awed by the photography and skilled editing that tied together the visual images with the phrasing in the music, but as the movie progressed, I found that the people in it who professed to have seen the wonder in God's works had severely limited that magnificent Creator through applying the rigid and ignorant thinking of creationist Christians.I got my undergraduate degree in science and have been interested in cosmology, quantum physics, and natural phenomena throughout my adult life. I also was raised in a traditional religious setting that I eventually outgrew and embraced a form of pantheism -- the perspective that there IS a Creator and It is present throughout and interpenetrates the manifest Creation. As the teacher of my 8th grade Sunday school class had pronounced, ""God is everywhere and in everything,"" not some distant remote being that we can only relate to from a distance and access through some appointed religious intermediary.The people in this movie quote the Bible to support their stance, but it is a case of ""selective truth,"" even in quoting Genesis. There are TWO DIFFERENT creation stories contained in the first two chapters of Genesis. They are the result of two different manuscripts being pasted together and come from two different sources. One is the ""elohistic"" manuscript (from the fact that the word ""God"" is always translated from the Hebrew ""elohim,"" a plural word), and the other is the Jahwistic manuscript, referring to a being named Jahweh who is depicted as strolling around in the Garden of Eden and sewing clothing for the naked couple he meets there -- clearly NOT the Creator, but someone that was perceived of as a ""god.""The people in the movie claim to be seeking to know the Creator through the wonders of the natural world, and I agree that much of their visual presentation IS awe-inspiring and wonder-full. However, the place I had to stop listening to what they were saying was their presentation of ""God"" as someone to be feared, obeyed and worshiped, and that there was a terrible punishment (hell) awaiting those whom this ""God"" had judged as not having lived up to some moral standard.To me it is not logical to consider the kind of incomprehensible intelligence that creates everything and then reduce it to the level of the human emotions of wrath, jealousy, and destructive rage. That would be to re-create ""God"" in MAN'S image, instead of the other way around.If one can ignore the blind ignorance of the presenters, this would be a worthwhile piece of amazing photography. I would give it four or five stars on that basis alone, but since I found the religious distortions totally unacceptable, offensive and illogical, I had to click off and can only give it one star.I want to emphasize that I not only believe that there IS a Creator, I have also studied the origins of the Bible extensively and concluded that it is a heavily edited piece, made up of writings from many authors over many centuries, and while some of it is both inspired and inspiring reading. we can't rely on it as an accurate record of what actually happened at any given time, nor to give us a true picture through which to live our lives. Others who consider the Bible as their authority will probably disagree with me on this, but this is what I have personally concluded through deep reflection and thought. I personally strive to live a life of integrity, honesty, and compassion, but because it pleases ME to do that, not because I want to avoid some kind of eternal damnation. As my father used to say, ""Living a good life is its own reward,"" and that's reason enough for me.",1,"Misleading, illogical and deeply conflicted",1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,3930,"['was', 'only', '10', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'school', 'introduced', 'science', 'curriculum', 'Everywhere', 'looked', 'saw', 'order', 'implied', 'ordering', 'force', 'was', 'looking', 'magnificent', 'clockworks', 'could', 'sense', 'clockmaker', 'hand', 'producing', 'watched', 'movie', 'based', 'trailer', 'was', 'awed', 'photography', 'skilled', 'editing', 'tied', 'together', 'visual', 'images', 'phrasing', 'music', 'movie', 'progressed', 'found', 'people', 'who', 'professed', 'have', 'seen', 'wonder', 'God', 'works', 'had', 'severely', 'limited', 'magnificent', 'Creator', 'applying', 'rigid', 'ignorant', 'thinking', 'creationist', 'Christians.I', 'got', 'undergraduate', 'degree', 'science', 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'cosmology', 'quantum', 'physics', 'natural', 'phenomena', 'adult', 'life', 'also', 'was', 'raised', 'traditional', 'religious', 'setting', 'eventually', 'outgrew', 'embraced', 'form', 'pantheism', 'perspective', 'Creator', 'present', 'manifest', 'Creation', 'teacher', '8th', 'grade', 'Sunday', 'school', 'class', 'had', 'pronounced', 'God', 'everywhere', 'everything', 'not', 'distant', 'remote', 'being', 'can', 'only', 'relate', 'distance', 'access', 'appointed', 'religious', 'intermediary.The', 'people', 'movie', 'Bible', 'support', 'stance', 'case', 'selective', 'truth', 'even', 'quoting', 'Genesis', 'are', 'TWO', 'DIFFERENT', 'creation', 'stories', 'contained', 'first', 'two', 'chapters', 'Genesis', 'are', 'result', 'two', 'different', 'manuscripts', 'being', 'pasted', 'together', 'come', 'two', 'different', 'sources', 'One', 'elohistic', 'manuscript', 'fact', 'word', 'God', 'always', 'translated', 'Hebrew', 'elohim', 'plural', 'word', 'other', 'Jahwistic', 'manuscript', 'referring', 'being', 'named', 'Jahweh', 'who', 'depicted', 'strolling', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'sewing', 'clothing', 'naked', 'couple', 'there', 'clearly', 'NOT', 'Creator', 'someone', 'was', 'perceived', 'god', 'people', 'movie', 'claim', 'be', 'seeking', 'know', 'Creator', 'wonders', 'natural', 'world', 'agree', 'much', 'visual', 'presentation', 'IS', 'awe-inspiring', 'wonder-full', 'However', 'place', 'had', 'stop', 'listening', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'was', 'presentation', 'God', 'someone', 'be', 'feared', 'obeyed', 'worshiped', 'was', 'terrible', 'punishment', 'hell', 'awaiting', 'whom', 'God', 'had', 'judged', 'not', 'having', 'lived', 'up', 'moral', 'standard.To', 'not', 'logical', 'consider', 'kind', 'incomprehensible', 'intelligence', 'everything', 'then', 'reduce', 'level', 'human', 'emotions', 'wrath', 'jealousy', 'destructive', 'rage', 'would', 'be', 're-create', 'God', 'MAN', 'image', 'instead', 'other', 'way', 'one', 'can', 'ignore', 'blind', 'ignorance', 'presenters', 'would', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'piece', 'amazing', 'photography', 'would', 'give', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'basis', 'alone', 'found', 'religious', 'distortions', 'totally', 'unacceptable', 'offensive', 'illogical', 'had', 'click', 'off', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'one', 'star.I', 'want', 'emphasize', 'not', 'only', 'believe', 'Creator', 'have', 'also', 'studied', 'origins', 'Bible', 'extensively', 'concluded', 'heavily', 'edited', 'piece', 'made', 'writings', 'many', 'authors', 'many', 'centuries', 'inspired', 'inspiring', 'reading', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rely', 'accurate', 'record', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'given', 'time', 'give', 'true', 'picture', 'live', 'lives', 'Others', 'who', 'consider', 'Bible', 'authority', 'will', 'probably', 'disagree', 'what', 'have', 'personally', 'concluded', 'deep', 'reflection', 'thought', 'personally', 'strive', 'live', 'life', 'integrity', 'honesty', 'compassion', 'ME', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'avoid', 'kind', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'father', 'used', 'say', 'Living', 'good', 'life', 'own', 'reward', 'reason', 'enough']",N/A

The latter, in turn, is shown as a tiny sphere next to the star Betelgeuse. And so on. Finally, billions of stars are found in billions of galaxies.Believers are sometimes accused of dwelling on the magnificence of nature while ignoring the hideous things in nature (e. g., predation, parasitism, and disease).

Im intelligent enough to see reality, and to me its just plain stupid to swallow the idea that there isnt some kind of creator out there. But why argue the point any further? The Christians will rate this high, and then theres the ignorant atheists who will stop by and have their say too. But I will say its an awfully shallow state of mind to be in when we know that even human beings have the power to re-create themselves yet there are those out there that cant equate the possibility of a supreme creator. And what evidence do they have to stand on anyway? Everything came from evolution and a big bang? Thats more difficult to believe in than to believe flesh eating Zombies exist. In fact I would pretty much become the narrowest and blindess of thinkers to accept such nonsense. So they prefer to believe in the most enept and impossible to take serious No God ideas than simply question the more obvious possibility. All I can figure is that these atheists are truly blinded by their own amazing ignorance. Surely the atheists will despise what I am saying. But it wont anger me because I realize they are swallowing theories so rediculous that I truly feel very sorry for them. Maybe this film shows no real proof, but niether does what they believe in.
