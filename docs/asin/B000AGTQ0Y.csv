926943,A1RC8FWDSL3YI3,B000AGTQ0Y,"F. E. Coffing ""HBO Series lover""","[18, 18]","For persons who love watching Chris Noth in the LAW & ORDER TV series, you will like this movie.  Chris Noth plays a struggling, honest attorney with a small law firm.  Trying to build himself and his firm, he works hard and ends up confronting THE JUDGE (Edward James Olmos) in a trial trying to defend an honest person.  THE JUDGE throws Chris in jail for contempt of court.  Rather then give up his principles, he refuses to apologize and stays in jail to serve his time.  There is much corruption in both city offices and in the police department.  THE JUDGE is set up, in order to try to get him removed from the bench and disbarred.  The police department is particularly racist and THE JUDGE is of latino parentage.  Finding no one who will plead his case, Edward James Olmos is forced to go to the only firm who will take his case.  Chris Noth is a attorney at this firm.  Christ does not like this man because he is the judge that would not be fair, and also threw him in jail for contempt of court.  Chris Noth's boss, does request that Chris handle the case......from here on you will see Chris at his finest and performances from both men are excellent.  This mini series is an excellent purchase for those who like court drama and are fans of both Chris Noth and Edward James Olmos.",4,Very nice mini series with Chris Noth and Edward James Olmos,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,1295,"['persons', 'who', 'love', 'watching', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'LAW', 'ORDER', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'struggling', 'honest', 'attorney', 'small', 'law', 'firm', 'Trying', 'build', 'firm', 'hard', 'up', 'confronting', 'THE', 'JUDGE', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'trial', 'trying', 'defend', 'honest', 'person', 'JUDGE', 'Chris', 'jail', 'contempt', 'court', 'then', 'give', 'up', 'principles', 'apologize', 'stays', 'jail', 'serve', 'time', 'much', 'corruption', 'city', 'offices', 'police', 'department', 'JUDGE', 'set', 'up', 'order', 'try', 'get', 'removed', 'bench', 'disbarred', 'police', 'department', 'particularly', 'racist', 'JUDGE', 'latino', 'parentage', 'Finding', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'plead', 'case', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'forced', 'go', 'only', 'firm', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'case', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'attorney', 'firm', 'Christ', 'not', 'man', 'judge', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'also', 'threw', 'jail', 'contempt', 'court', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'boss', 'request', 'Chris', 'handle', 'case', 'here', 'will', 'see', 'Chris', 'finest', 'performances', 'men', 'are', 'excellent', 'mini', 'series', 'excellent', 'purchase', 'who', 'like', 'court', 'drama', 'are', 'fans', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos']",N/A

Had no idea what to expect but this held me every minute.  I can usually figure out who ""did it"", but was so surprised at the ending--not at all anyone I was thinking was guilty.  Had never heard of this movie before--bought it for the actors who were in it.  Some actors you can count on in a movie--always putting out a great one while others are so-so & you might not buy it unless you knew the film.

The two play a pair of lawyers defending a judge against a murder charge.  It is suspected that the judge was framed by the police, becuase he had been spearheading a grand jury investigation against them for misconduct.There are lots of surprising discoveries made throughout the trial, as it seems everyone has secrets to hide (including the defense lawyers who are the good guys in this movie!).This is a long movie (3 hours or so?) but really enjoyable and for the $6.99 Amazon price, it is well worth it!
