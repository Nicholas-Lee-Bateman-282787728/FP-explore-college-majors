590211,A3QC4SG7NA4ULG,B00005JKNU,A reader,"[0, 0]","The contradictory title of my review sums up my feelings about this flick.  It's bad because:  (1) It's set in the supposedly realistic environment of a modern military prison, but it's very unbelievable (you'll see what I mean if you make it to the last half-hour). (2) You know, more or less, how it's going to end from the opening scenes, because the set-up is so predictable: noble, god-like prisoner vs. sadistic prison warden who's turned his prison into a hellhole. (3) It shovels a huge load of jingoistic claptrap about the U.S. military that you must either agree with or have the ability to ignore in order to see it through.But, it's good because:  (1) The performances are great.  James Gandolfini and Robert Redford make interesting, although unequal, adversaries, and the tension between them feels real.  Redford was 65 years old at the time of filming and in very fit condition.  So, even though his role is highly idealized, it's not hard to imagine him as a super-soldier trained over a lifetime of combat to stand his ground in the face of adversity.  The supporting cast is also excellent, particularly Clifton Collins Jr. and Steve Burton.  (However, the lack of important African-American characters, with the exception of the token bigshot played by Delroy Lindo, is a failing of the film, considering how many Black extras are in the movie.) (2) The pacing is excellent, and just when I thought I was going to stop watching, something hooked me in to stick with it.  (3) The action scenes are well edited (although hard to believe) and have real energy and excitement in them.  (4) The script contains some interesting twists and turns that, while not changing the outcome, bring some depth to the storyline.To sum up:  if you enjoy prison films, lots of manly bluster with some violence, a heroic slant on the military, good acting and action sequences, and can overlook the ""WHAT? you've got to be kidding me!""  factor of the last half-hour, you might just enjoy THE LAST CASTLE.",3,Bad but Watchable,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,2006,"['contradictory', 'title', 'review', 'sums', 'up', 'feelings', 'flick', 'bad', '1', 'set', 'supposedly', 'realistic', 'environment', 'modern', 'military', 'prison', 'very', 'unbelievable', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'make', 'last', 'half-hour', '2', 'know', 'more', 'less', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'opening', 'scenes', 'set-up', 'so', 'predictable', 'noble', 'god-like', 'prisoner', 'vs.', 'sadistic', 'prison', 'warden', 'who', 'turned', 'prison', 'hellhole', '3', 'huge', 'load', 'jingoistic', 'claptrap', 'U.S.', 'military', 'must', 'either', 'agree', 'have', 'ability', 'ignore', 'order', 'see', 'good', '1', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'make', 'interesting', 'unequal', 'adversaries', 'tension', 'feels', 'real', 'Redford', 'was', '65', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'filming', 'very', 'fit', 'condition', 'So', 'even', 'role', 'highly', 'idealized', 'not', 'hard', 'imagine', 'super-soldier', 'trained', 'lifetime', 'combat', 'stand', 'ground', 'face', 'adversity', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Steve', 'Burton', 'However', 'lack', 'important', 'African-American', 'characters', 'exception', 'token', 'bigshot', 'played', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'failing', 'film', 'considering', 'how', 'many', 'Black', 'extras', 'are', 'movie', '2', 'pacing', 'excellent', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'stop', 'watching', 'something', 'hooked', 'stick', '3', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'edited', 'hard', 'believe', 'have', 'real', 'energy', 'excitement', '4', 'script', 'interesting', 'twists', 'not', 'changing', 'outcome', 'bring', 'depth', 'storyline.To', 'sum', 'up', 'enjoy', 'prison', 'films', 'lots', 'manly', 'bluster', 'violence', 'heroic', 'slant', 'military', 'good', 'acting', 'action', 'sequences', 'can', 'overlook', 'WHAT', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'factor', 'last', 'half-hour', 'might', 'just', 'enjoy', 'LAST', 'CASTLE']",N/A

Russell Crowe's Roman general/gladiator figure and Charlton Heston's Judah Ben-Hur come to  mind.  We love seeing them re-assemble their scattered powers and claw their way back to the top.  In this film the wonderful Robert Redford is a dashed, but previously mighty, three-star general, Eugene Irwin. The character has admittedly made mistakes in the past, but his heroic sense of honor and high-minded character are readily discernible.  I never cease to admire Redford's ability to portray the human male at its most heroic best. &quot;Inspiring&quot; is not too strong a descriptor.The use of prison-as-castle metaphor offers interesting possibilities for Redford's character, the Chess-loving, master of military strategy.His nemesis, Warden Colonel Winter, is played with just the right amount of creepy smarminess by James Gandolfini (think: &quot;borderline personality&quot;).  The supporting cast does a creditable job as well.The plot, while not air-tight, is fairly serviceable and there is just the right amount of action/adventure (these ARE military people, and this IS a prison).Special mention certainly goes to the screenplay, which is very well crafted and quite intelligent.A good measuring stick for me is the length of time this film &quot;stayed with me&quot; after the credits were complete.

Robert Redford, never straying far from his golden boy screen persona, here delivers a curiously flat, monotone performance as an iconic military general imprisoned for misconduct in battle (we surmise it was misconduct for noble reasons, though the film never tells us this; his character, after all, oozes nobility as though it comes from a tube.) Gandolfini, the film's black hat, is similarly straight jacketed in a one-note  performance as the sadistic warden of the prison. Watching him here, one would never know he had the versatility he demonstrates in the &quot;The Sopranos.&quot; The Castle's script is a laughable fright, full of ponderous dialogue leaded with chest thumping themes about military honor and self-respect.

590222,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JKNU,D. Litton,"[4, 6]","""I'm under no illusion why the these men are here, Colonel. I just think they might be reminded of some of the good things they've done, rather than only the worst.""This and many other emotionally charged lines, serve as the moral basis of Rod Lurie's ""The Last Castle,"" a slam-bang prison drama with a heightened fervor that will have you on the edge of your seat until the blazing, bloody end. Okay, so some of the film's technical details in regards to military intelligence seem farfetched, but its story packs a tremendous wallop while instilling a sense of courage and honor into its heroes, who just happen to be inmates.The good thing about Lurie's film is that it doesn't try to sidestep the fact that these people are criminals, accomplishing this through the newly arrived inmate, formerly saluted as General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford). Court-marshaled for disobeying an order that resulted in catastrophe, Irwin, sentenced to ten years imprisonment, acknowledges his wrong-doings and has accepted his punishment. Once in prison, called ""the castle"" by its warden, Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), Irwin begins questioning Winter's tactics, which range from by the book to outright malicious.After their initial meeting, Irwin becomes an object of mute jealousy for Winter, whose lack of combat experience (not to mention Irwin's mockery of his civil war relics) is fuel for his harsh treatment of select prisoners. At first, the other inmates beckon with Irwin to discuss Winter's actions with his political connections on the outside, but Irwin will have none of it. That is, until he becomes the next select prisoner, made an example by Winter to show the inmates that he is no different than them.Thus begins the battle of wills, played out with terrific gusto by Redford and Gandolfini. As Irwin, Redford is pretty much putting on that old Redford charm once again, but it's never looked or sounded better. He endows his character with all the brazen charm and suitably in-your-face dialogue needed for the audience to stick with him in his struggle. Gandolfini is outstanding as Winter, his character's corrupt ideals lighting the fire for the film's terrifically charged third act, in which Irwin leads the inmates in an uprising meant to overthrow the balance of power and have Winter removed from his position of command.It is here that the movie suffers its few pitfalls, due to logical faults as a result of fluid storytelling. For instance, one might question the way in which the inmates are herded into the courtyard while the remainder of the guards search their cells, but it works if you think of it in terms of Winter exercising his morbid thirst for power in an attempt to shut down Irwin's operation. As the action increases, Lurie's film takes on a tremendous amount of intensity; the predictability factor of Irwin's step-by-step plan is an attribute, taking us right where we want to go without hesitation or loss of interest.It's not as deep as a film like ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" and some may find it jingoistic, but ""The Last Castle"" benefits from a lucid and effective plot, to say nothing of the stellar cast, both lead and supporting. The undertakings of the film's first act may not have a clear destination, but once it gets going, it's a welcomed one-way ticket aimed at morality issues surrounding American patriotism in battle against corruption.

The cast of characters is superb with Robert Redford playing the part of a three star general who knows he has done wrong by challenging presidential authority and is sentenced to serve time in military prison run by a prison warden, played by James Gandolfini, who has power but is not a leader of men.The two clash and soon they are involved in a war. While Robert Redford wanted to serve his time in peace and in the solitude of his cell, the events that take place surface his true character and a leader at heart; he is soon fighting injustice and protecting the rule of law.The drama that ensues captured our spirit and we found ourselves enraptured by the characters, as one by one of the men regain their self-esteem and their purpose as soldiers.The balance between justice and injustice, between honesty and betrayal, between leadership and cowardice is simply superb. As with all DVDs, this one has extra features and we were delighted to learn all about how the movie was made, how some of the actors were playing their first roles and how much they appreciated to be acting with the likes of Robert Redford, one of the best actors of our time.

590225,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKNU,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 1]","Welcome to a world where the bad guys are good and the good guys are despicable.  The ""castle"" is a military prison run by a harsh, ego maniacal warden (James Gandolfini) and it seems bad things are being done to bad people in the name of discipline.  Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) finds himself incarcerated with these reprobates and promptly finds the good in them, ultimately inspiring them to enlist in his noble inmate army to fight for humane prison reform.Once again, Hollywood gets on its soapbox to preach to us about the rights of these fine upstanding violent criminals who are being victimized by society by having to endure the injustices of the penal system, just because they killed, maimed, raped or broke some other really unfair and irrelevant rules.  You see they are really decent guys at heart.This must be a pet cause of Robert Redford's because this is the second prison reform film in which he has starred.  The other was ""Brubaker"", where a reform minded warden enters the prison population to experience life in the yard, so he can get a prisoner's view of the conditions before he takes command.  Needless to say, he finds them entirely too inhospitable and immediately reforms the prison so they can all become model inmates and future civic leaders.The problem I have with this Hollywood version of reality is that they always make the authority figures evil, corrupt and sadistic, while making the prisoners into pure souls who are just trying to get by while living in these oppressive conditions.  Clearly, in real life the opposite is true, which is why I have major difficulty conjuring up any sympathy for them.The film itself pulls all the right strings, but it is contrived and unrealistic at every turn.  General Irwin's personality is completely different from the background information we have about him.  All the character development about his past indicates a hard boiled career officer.  Yet, what we see in prison is a soft spoken, touchy-feely pussycat that sees the good in everyone.  The entire plot to take over the prison is full of improbabilities and incredulities (as if they could be building a makeshift trebuchet without raising suspicion; and prisoners would have easy access to gallons of flammable liquids with which to make Molotov cocktails).  Also laughable is the notion that a guard in a tower, sharpshooter or not, could consistently hit a prisoner in the head with a pump shotgun with rubber bullets and no scope from the standing position at a distance of two to three hundred feet.  How gullible do they believe we are?The acting is excellent and director Rod Lurie keeps the story moving, while drawing us in emotionally to identify with the plight of the prisoners.  The action sequences are well done.  This is a technically excellent film that is effective at what intends to do, namely turning the bad guys into heroes and getting us to root them.  Still, not many of the movie-going public fell for it as the film failed to gross even one third of its $60 million budget.This is a good film with nave political subtext and an utterly contrived plot.  I rated it a 6/10.

It is dealing with justice for military personnel and soldiers. No one will question the justness of a court-martial but what happens to a soldier, what's more a three star general, if he is court-martialed to serve some time in a military prison. The prisoners in that prison have been humiliated and broken down into some wild animals because a colonel only decided to see the crimes of these men and not the good potential that was and always will be in them as soldiers, and probably as men. They were trained soldiers and they have made a mistake that they have to pay for, but they are no animals. They are human and they remain human, they are military and they remain military with some strong powerful values they still are ready to die for provided they find a good leadership. The colonel who is abusing his power as the boss of this military prison does not understand any other language than repression and force and killing those who do not obey. It can only work when the mass of the prisoners are divided and hostile to one another. Bring one high ranking officer among them who will know how to rebuild their self-pride and their sense of honor and they will follow him to regain their military humanity. The best part in the film is that it demonstrates how easy it is to organize a take-over in such a prison if you are imaginative and you have the sense of command and the sanity to respect the best in each man. What's more the soldiers on the side of the colonel will also recognize in the prisoners and their fight the high human and military values they believe in. These soldiers will decide to isolate the colonel and even arrest him for having lost control of his ""fortress"" by his own efforts and lack of moral humanism. The film is probably slightly optimistic on that point but it can go through because the flag of the fortress, which is also the flag of the USA but could be the flag of any country, is in the hands of the main rebel and he is going to hoist up on its flagpole. That very act, though the three star general prisoner will be shot while doing that by the defeated colonel, just before his own captain arrests him, creates a reaction among all the soldiers, prisoners or not that leads them to salute the flag and find an epiphany in that act. No matter what the colonel used to say, before being court-martialed in his turn, these men may have done something wrong but they remain human beings and soldiers.

And I have to say up front that I really, really WANTED to like this one, since it starred two of my favorite actors (Gandolfini and Redford) and had a vision of idealism, patriotism and duty that is laudable.Set in a military prison, the whole film centers on General Irwin (played by Redford) a career military man who made one mistake, defying a Presidentail order, although he did it with the best of intentions. He comes to the prison with his reputation intact and he is seen as a mythic figure by most of the men, including Colonial Winter (Gandolfini) who is in charge of the prision.Although Winter wants to remain on good terms with Irwin, they're fated to clash, since Irwin has no sympathy for Winter's brutal, often deadly methods of controlling the prisoners. Eventually Irwin decides to take over the prison and request Winter's resignation.And that's when the movie starts to break down. I didn't believe for a moment that this group of prisoners, even military prisoners, could assemble the arsenal of sophisticated weapons these men did, from catapaults to fire bombs. They used their lunch trays as shields against bullets and massive attacks of water hoses. I couldn't suspend my belief and accept that. Bullets, even rubber bullets, would have gone penetrated those flimsy lunch trays.

590241,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKNU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","My thought is that James Gandolfini or any action on the face of the planet is not going to turn down an opportunity to act in a movie with Robert Redford, so that means the only reason question is why Redford signed up for this film.  For that I have come up with two explanations.  The first is that the victory of good men over the tyranny of an evil person in a position of power appeals to Redford's political sensibilities.  The other is that ""Brubaker"" was a seminal experience in his film career and he wanted to try a prison picture from the other side of the bars.  Take your pick or make up a reason of your own.The film begins with a voice over narration by Redford enumerating the four key elements that define a castle.  You are advised to pay attention to this list because these elements will come into play in the climax of the film where the metaphor of ""The Last Castle"" is exploited for everything it is worth.  In one sense this is a fairly standard film where the hero is a prisoner who decides to take on the brutal prison warden.  The fundamental twist is that it is a military prison, so Redford's character, Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin, has some dormant sensibilities that he can restore in the men.  On the one hand the film avoids the cliche of Irwin being innocent; he freely admits he was guilty of the crime for which he is being punished (and while the crime is not exactly laid out completely later in the film there is enough of a hole in what we learn to continue thinking Irwin was, at least on some significant level, doing the ""right"" thing).Gandolfini plays Colnel Winter, who Irwin correctly pegs on the basis of his collection of Civil War bullets as someone who has never been in combat.  However, that proves to be the least of Winter's problems because the man has come up with his own ideas regarding how to manage brutal prisoners.  At one point we find out Winter has been cleared in three investigations, which is the point at which I want to start banging my head against the wall at the idea that there is no difference between the men who run military prisons in the 21st century and those who worked the torture chambers of the Spanish Inquisition, not to mention the fact that the Judge Advocate's office of the U.S. Army is totally incompetent.  Winters is stupid and predictable (sort of like this movie) and we know Irwin will take him down just as soon as he decides to wake up and smell the rubber bullets striking prisoners down at Winter's command.The key to the film, which is clear pretty early on, is that Irwin is going to be one step ahead of Winter once he gets in gear and decides the prison commander needs to be removed from his post.  After all, Irwin was a P.O.W. in North Vietnam, still baring the scars of his torture, so Winter and crew have a long way to go to give him a new experience in hell on earth.  I think half way through the movie you know pretty much what is going to happen at the end and the only reason question are the specifics on how this will be accomplished (Director Rod Lurie gets credit for throwing a red herring at us that I thought was giving away too much of the ending).David Scarpa's story/script is basically one of those works that echoes dozens of films, not just prison films in the tradition of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" but also other films from ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail.""  If you take ""The Last Castle"" as pure Hollywood escapism (i.e.., disengage brain and forget about the way the real world functions) you can enjoy it.  The acting and direction are both competent, even if you are left with the definite impression that Redford is on auto-pilot and the fact that Gandolfini is not given all that much to do but look out a window and spout threats.  As for the idea Redford is too old to be an action hero, I would not say carrying rocks around constitutes ""action"" per se.",3,No contest as Robert Redford takes down James Gandolfini,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,3934,"['thought', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'action', 'face', 'planet', 'not', 'going', 'turn', 'down', 'opportunity', 'act', 'movie', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'only', 'reason', 'question', 'why', 'Redford', 'signed', 'up', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'two', 'explanations', 'first', 'victory', 'good', 'men', 'tyranny', 'evil', 'person', 'position', 'power', 'appeals', 'Redford', 'political', 'sensibilities', 'other', 'Brubaker', 'was', 'seminal', 'experience', 'film', 'career', 'wanted', 'try', 'prison', 'picture', 'other', 'side', 'bars', 'Take', 'pick', 'make', 'up', 'reason', 'own.The', 'film', 'voice', 'narration', 'Redford', 'enumerating', 'four', 'key', 'elements', 'define', 'castle', 'are', 'advised', 'pay', 'attention', 'list', 'elements', 'will', 'come', 'play', 'climax', 'film', 'where', 'metaphor', 'Last', 'Castle', 'exploited', 'everything', 'worth', 'one', 'sense', 'fairly', 'standard', 'film', 'where', 'hero', 'prisoner', 'who', 'take', 'brutal', 'prison', 'warden', 'fundamental', 'twist', 'military', 'prison', 'Redford', 'character', 'Lieutenant', 'General', 'Eugene', 'Irwin', 'dormant', 'sensibilities', 'can', 'restore', 'men', 'one', 'hand', 'film', 'cliche', 'Irwin', 'being', 'innocent', 'freely', 'was', 'guilty', 'crime', 'being', 'punished', 'crime', 'not', 'exactly', 'laid', 'out', 'completely', 'later', 'film', 'enough', 'hole', 'what', 'learn', 'continue', 'thinking', 'Irwin', 'was', 'least', 'significant', 'level', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', '.Gandolfini', 'Colnel', 'Winter', 'who', 'Irwin', 'correctly', 'basis', 'collection', 'Civil', 'War', 'bullets', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'combat', 'However', 'be', 'least', 'Winter', 'problems', 'man', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'ideas', 'regarding', 'how', 'manage', 'brutal', 'prisoners', 'one', 'point', 'find', 'out', 'Winter', 'been', 'cleared', 'three', 'investigations', 'point', 'want', 'start', 'banging', 'head', 'wall', 'idea', 'difference', 'men', 'who', 'run', 'military', 'prisons', '21st', 'century', 'who', 'worked', 'torture', 'chambers', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'Judge', 'Advocate', 'office', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'totally', 'incompetent', 'Winters', 'stupid', 'predictable', 'sort', 'movie', 'know', 'Irwin', 'will', 'take', 'down', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'wake', 'up', 'smell', 'rubber', 'bullets', 'striking', 'prisoners', 'down', 'Winter', 'command.The', 'key', 'film', 'clear', 'pretty', 'early', 'Irwin', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Winter', 'once', 'gear', 'prison', 'commander', 'be', 'removed', 'post', 'Irwin', 'was', 'P.O.W', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'still', 'baring', 'scars', 'torture', 'so', 'Winter', 'crew', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'give', 'new', 'experience', 'hell', 'earth', 'think', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'only', 'reason', 'question', 'are', 'specifics', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'accomplished', 'Director', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'credit', 'throwing', 'red', 'herring', 'thought', 'was', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'ending', '.David', 'Scarpa', 'story/script', 'basically', 'one', 'works', 'echoes', 'dozens', 'films', 'not', 'just', 'prison', 'films', 'tradition', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'also', 'other', 'films', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'take', 'Last', 'Castle', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'escapism', 'i.e..', 'disengage', 'brain', 'forget', 'way', 'real', 'world', 'functions', 'can', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'competent', 'even', 'are', 'left', 'definite', 'impression', 'Redford', 'auto-pilot', 'fact', 'Gandolfini', 'not', 'given', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'look', 'out', 'window', 'spout', 'threats', 'idea', 'Redford', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'action', 'hero', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'carrying', 'rocks', 'constitutes', 'action', 'se']",N/A

From the beginning there is conflict between the two men as Redford views Gandolfini as a tin soldier who has never been in real battles. As the film goes on, we see Gandolfini as nothing short of a sadist who punishes the men severely for every infraction of his silly rules.  The story moves fast and the audience identifies with the plight of the men who have lost their pride in being soldiers.  Redford orchestrates psychological strategies to rattle Gandolfini as well as armed conflict.  The plot moves so fast and is so involving that I got totally absorbed in the film, rooting for the prisoners as they fought for dignity under Gandolfini's heavy hand.Redford is a good actor and played his part well.  He has lines in his face, which make him look real. James Gandolfini is magnificent and shows the range of his acting skills because the role called for a complex and nuanced performance.  As I was watching the film, I was so caught up in the story that there was no time to think about the holes in the plot.  By the next morning though I felt it was all rather contrived and silly.I was impressed by the clarity of the DVD picture and the extras at the end of the film, such as the director's voice-over as we watched scenes that had been cut. All this added to my viewing enjoyment.  As for the film itself, it will appeal to those who, like me, enjoy war movies.  Don't expect to cry and don't expect to laugh.

Kind of a rush!  In TLC, Redford plays one of his two primary screen types....the stoic hero (The Natural, Jeremiah Johnson).  He's aged well andis believable in the part, although it pales in comparison to the other 2 ""stoic movies"" named above.Finished the movie with a pleasant sense of excitement.  Not often that I do that and still give it only 3 stars (!) But, as I reflect on it, I really disliked the screen play, the moral message, and the directing and editing.  Gandolfini is OK as the smarmy prison warden, and there are some notable supporting performers.  But the film just, well, lacks.If you review the scenes that were chopped off, you will see a couple that should have been retained to help maintain the characterization.  One scene shows the camaraderie between Redford and other inmates, and you can understand why they would follow him.  One scene shows the same chemistry between Gandolfini and his men, and it helps you see why the men carried out his self-serving orders...when he is with just them, there is definitely an aura of leadership.

590253,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKNU,Matthew Horner,"[10, 15]","""The Last Castle"" is one of those rousing, flag-waving movies that are supposed to make the audience feel proud and thrilled to be a part of whatever institution or tradition the movie is touting. On a technical level it succeeds as well as any other old-fashioned, by-the-book film does. It contains wonderful performances by Robert Redford and James Gandolfini, which are enough to make it worth watching. Unfortunately, they are hampered by a screenplay which either a) has a morally questionable premise, or b) is too murky to allow the ironies of story to be easily understood. Either way, it prevents a good movie from being a great one.The title refers to a military prison; It's old and foreboding. [The movie was shot on location at an abandoned Tennessee State Prison.] Col. Winter [Gandolfini] is the warden. He runs the place with a bully's iron fist. His office is in stark contrast to the rest of the prison. With its picture window overlooking the yard, its wood paneled walls and its immaculate collection of Winter's treasured war memorabilia, it's the lair of a refined sadist. The arrival of Gen. Irwin [Redford], who has been sentenced to ten years, signals the end of Winter's perfect little world. The colonel admires Irwin and even thinks he doesn't belong there, but, when he overhears a remark the general makes about the memorabilia's being the sign of an officer who's never seen battle, he becomes quietly enraged. Some of the prisoners start coming to Irwin with stories about the dreadful way that Winter runs at place. He tries to ignore them. After all, these aren't saints and choirboys. One day an incident occurs that Irwin can't ignore because it insults the core of his being as an officer and a gentleman. Irwin and Winter are now on a collision course, one that will lead to a remarkable and violent conclusion.Watching Redford and Gandolfini is like watching two remarkable athletes or dancers at work. Each gives his role an authenticity younger performers should study. Redford, of course, is a film icon. His forte is playing basically decent characters thrown into a moral quandary. Gandolfini is perfection. His colonel's dangerous personality is always visible just beneath his civilized demeanor. He is truly frightening. Mark Ruffalo and Clifton Collins Jr. are very good in supporting roles.Although the flaws in the script won't affect viewers who pay attention only to the action aspects of the movie, they were enough for me to be dissatisfied. Some are minor and are the results of lazy editing. For example, it is never explained how the prisoners construct the weapons used in the climax with a hundred guards looking on. The major one is a confused sense of moral righteousness. Irwin is certainly smarter and kinder than Winter is in his techniques for getting the men to obey and follow him, but he is just as manipulative. In his own way, he is also monster underneath his far more likeable facade. The explanation of why he is in prison is proof enough of this. Considering the insight into characters and their motivations that director Rod Lurie showed in his previous movies, ""The Contender"" and ""Deterrence"", I suspect this is what we are supposed to see. And yet the ending contradicts and distorts this point of view. It presupposes that we have to have a hero, and that's a copout that's bad enough to seriously mar the movie overall.",3,"Redford, Gandolfini rise above murky story",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,3401,"['Last', 'Castle', 'one', 'rousing', 'flag-waving', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'proud', 'thrilled', 'be', 'part', 'institution', 'tradition', 'movie', 'touting', 'technical', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'old-fashioned', 'by-the-book', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'hampered', 'screenplay', 'morally', 'questionable', 'premise', 'b', 'too', 'murky', 'allow', 'ironies', 'story', 'be', 'easily', 'understood', 'way', 'good', 'movie', 'being', 'great', 'one.The', 'title', 'refers', 'military', 'prison', 'old', 'foreboding', '[', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'abandoned', 'Tennessee', 'State', 'Prison', ']', 'Col.', 'Winter', '[', 'Gandolfini', ']', 'warden', 'place', 'bully', 'iron', 'fist', 'office', 'stark', 'contrast', 'rest', 'prison', 'picture', 'window', 'overlooking', 'yard', 'wood', 'paneled', 'walls', 'immaculate', 'collection', 'Winter', 'treasured', 'war', 'memorabilia', 'lair', 'refined', 'sadist', 'arrival', 'Gen.', 'Irwin', '[', 'Redford', ']', 'who', 'been', 'sentenced', 'ten', 'years', 'end', 'Winter', 'perfect', 'little', 'world', 'colonel', 'Irwin', 'even', 'thinks', ""n't"", 'belong', 'there', 'when', 'remark', 'general', 'memorabilia', 'being', 'sign', 'officer', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'battle', 'quietly', 'enraged', 'prisoners', 'start', 'coming', 'Irwin', 'stories', 'dreadful', 'way', 'Winter', 'place', 'ignore', 'are', ""n't"", 'saints', 'choirboys', 'One', 'day', 'incident', 'Irwin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'core', 'being', 'officer', 'gentleman', 'Irwin', 'Winter', 'are', 'now', 'collision', 'course', 'one', 'will', 'lead', 'remarkable', 'violent', 'conclusion.Watching', 'Redford', 'Gandolfini', 'watching', 'two', 'remarkable', 'athletes', 'dancers', 'work', 'role', 'authenticity', 'younger', 'performers', 'should', 'study', 'Redford', 'course', 'film', 'icon', 'forte', 'playing', 'basically', 'decent', 'characters', 'thrown', 'moral', 'quandary', 'Gandolfini', 'perfection', 'colonel', 'dangerous', 'personality', 'always', 'visible', 'just', 'civilized', 'demeanor', 'truly', 'frightening', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'supporting', 'flaws', 'script', 'wo', ""n't"", 'affect', 'viewers', 'who', 'pay', 'attention', 'only', 'action', 'aspects', 'movie', 'were', 'enough', 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'are', 'minor', 'are', 'results', 'lazy', 'editing', 'example', 'never', 'explained', 'how', 'prisoners', 'construct', 'weapons', 'used', 'climax', 'hundred', 'guards', 'looking', 'major', 'one', 'confused', 'sense', 'moral', 'righteousness', 'Irwin', 'certainly', 'smarter', 'kinder', 'Winter', 'techniques', 'getting', 'men', 'obey', 'follow', 'just', 'as', 'manipulative', 'own', 'way', 'also', 'monster', 'far', 'more', 'likeable', 'facade', 'explanation', 'why', 'prison', 'proof', 'enough', 'Considering', 'insight', 'characters', 'motivations', 'director', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'showed', 'previous', 'movies', 'Contender', 'Deterrence', 'suspect', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'yet', 'ending', 'contradicts', 'distorts', 'point', 'view', 'have', 'have', 'hero', 'copout', 'bad', 'enough', 'seriously', 'mar', 'movie', 'overall']",N/A
590254,A2A3GTGNPCRFFE,B00005JKNU,Maximillian Ben Hanan,"[13, 17]","""The Last Castle"" is a novel about the inherent value of human life. Even the worst of prisoners and other undesirables are still human beings and if we look deep enough, we can find nobility and value in them too. I enjoyed this film and its' message.The story's plot revolves around a remarkable man, Lieutenant General Eugene Erwin played by Robert Redford, and his sentencing to a ten-year prison sentence at a military prison for a crime unmentioned until later in the film. As Erwin is brought to prison, we meet the leading antagonist, Colonel Winter, played by James Gandolfini, a quiet soft-spoken man and the prison warden whose personality seems to be much deeper than his civilized exterior. After Erwin and Winters meet some ten minutes or so into the movie, we can see that the rest of the film will be about a test of wills between the two.The film's climax culminates in the prisoners staging an overthrow of Colonel Winter and his guards by the prisoners led by Erwin. The director really thought up some innovative ideas for how prisoners might deal with helicopters, riot cars with hydraulic hoses, and guard towers. Many of the other reviewers wrote that they thought the prisoners' solutions to the helicopters, riot cars with hydraulic hoses, and guard towers were a bit far fetched. I don't agree and found everything plausible if not very likely. The prisoners use food trays as shields like Roman Legionnaires in Tetsudo formation (a solid line of shields) to protect themselves from the water cannon on the riot car and some of the prisoners crawl under the building and cut off the water main feeding the water cannon. They then use the water cannon to shoot a grappling hook attached to a chain, which entangles the helicopter's landing skids. Even better, then a prisoner, who is also a helicopter pilot, shimmies up the chain and overpowers the helicopter pilot. See what I mean about plausible but farfetched?Meanwhile the prisoners have built a trebuchet (a gravity catapult) and are using rubber medical hose to lob bags of flammables at the guard towers. I got a particular chuckle out of this one since I remember engineering students at university hooking gigantic piece of rubber medical hose between two antennas on our dorm's roof to hurl water balloons at an opposing dorm. I can definitely vouch that rubber medical hose works fine for lobbing things great distances.However, the crown jewel of the film is Redford's portrayal of General Erwin. Redford gives Erwin a force of character and a determination that makes it hard not to like him. He's very believable as a general. The film also relates that Erwin is a former POW and Vietnam veteran. Redford's lines about the experience correspond with every novel I've read about the POW experience in Vietnam. Once again, Redfrod's performance rang true. A minor subtheme for the film is chess and all of Erwin's moves are related to a chess game including the eventual overthrow of the prison. One reviewer wrote that Erwin was just as much a manipulator as Gandolfini's Colonel Winters and to this point I disagree. Erwin portrays a general who leads men by example and respect. This is called leadership and has nothing to do with manipulation. A general leads men to accomplish a task that he or she may or may not agree with. A manipulator USES men to accomplish tasks for the manipulator's own ends. There is a strong difference between the two.I highly recommend this excellent drama.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan",5,Touching Story of Human Dignity,1052438400,"05 9, 2003",2003,3513,"['Last', 'Castle', 'novel', 'inherent', 'value', 'human', 'life', 'Even', 'worst', 'prisoners', 'other', 'undesirables', 'are', 'still', 'human', 'beings', 'look', 'deep', 'enough', 'can', 'find', 'nobility', 'value', 'too', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'message.The', 'story', 'plot', 'around', 'remarkable', 'man', 'Lieutenant', 'General', 'Eugene', 'Erwin', 'played', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'sentencing', 'ten-year', 'prison', 'sentence', 'military', 'prison', 'crime', 'unmentioned', 'later', 'film', 'Erwin', 'brought', 'prison', 'meet', 'leading', 'antagonist', 'Colonel', 'Winter', 'played', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'quiet', 'soft-spoken', 'man', 'prison', 'warden', 'personality', 'be', 'much', 'deeper', 'civilized', 'exterior', 'Erwin', 'Winters', 'meet', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'rest', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'test', 'wills', 'two.The', 'film', 'climax', 'prisoners', 'staging', 'overthrow', 'Colonel', 'Winter', 'guards', 'prisoners', 'led', 'Erwin', 'director', 'really', 'thought', 'up', 'innovative', 'ideas', 'how', 'prisoners', 'might', 'deal', 'helicopters', 'riot', 'cars', 'hydraulic', 'hoses', 'guard', 'towers', 'Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'wrote', 'thought', 'prisoners', 'solutions', 'helicopters', 'riot', 'cars', 'hydraulic', 'hoses', 'guard', 'towers', 'were', 'bit', 'far', 'fetched', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'found', 'everything', 'plausible', 'not', 'very', 'likely', 'prisoners', 'use', 'food', 'trays', 'shields', 'Roman', 'Legionnaires', 'Tetsudo', 'formation', 'solid', 'line', 'shields', 'protect', 'water', 'cannon', 'riot', 'car', 'prisoners', 'crawl', 'building', 'cut', 'off', 'water', 'main', 'feeding', 'water', 'cannon', 'then', 'use', 'water', 'cannon', 'shoot', 'grappling', 'hook', 'attached', 'chain', 'helicopter', 'landing', 'skids', 'Even', 'better', 'then', 'prisoner', 'who', 'also', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'up', 'chain', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'plausible', 'farfetched', 'Meanwhile', 'prisoners', 'have', 'built', 'trebuchet', 'gravity', 'catapult', 'are', 'using', 'rubber', 'medical', 'hose', 'lob', 'bags', 'flammables', 'guard', 'towers', 'got', 'particular', 'chuckle', 'one', 'remember', 'engineering', 'students', 'university', 'hooking', 'gigantic', 'piece', 'rubber', 'medical', 'hose', 'two', 'antennas', 'dorm', 'roof', 'hurl', 'water', 'balloons', 'opposing', 'dorm', 'can', 'definitely', 'vouch', 'rubber', 'medical', 'hose', 'works', 'fine', 'lobbing', 'things', 'great', 'distances.However', 'crown', 'jewel', 'film', 'Redford', 'portrayal', 'General', 'Erwin', 'Redford', 'Erwin', 'force', 'character', 'determination', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'very', 'believable', 'general', 'film', 'also', 'Erwin', 'former', 'POW', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'Redford', 'lines', 'experience', 'correspond', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'read', 'POW', 'experience', 'Vietnam', 'Once', 'again', 'Redfrod', 'performance', 'rang', 'true', 'minor', 'subtheme', 'film', 'chess', 'Erwin', 'moves', 'are', 'related', 'chess', 'game', 'including', 'eventual', 'overthrow', 'prison', 'One', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'Erwin', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'manipulator', 'Gandolfini', 'Colonel', 'Winters', 'point', 'disagree', 'Erwin', 'general', 'who', 'men', 'example', 'respect', 'called', 'leadership', 'nothing', 'do', 'manipulation', 'general', 'men', 'accomplish', 'task', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'manipulator', 'USES', 'men', 'accomplish', 'tasks', 'manipulator', 'own', 'ends', 'strong', 'difference', 'two.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'drama.Review', 'Maximillian', 'Ben', 'Hanan']",N/A

It is the commandant's downfall that his lack of respect for anyone other than himself ushers in a new regime.Robert Redford is very good in the role of the General Irwin.  At first, he seems reticent and willing to serve his ten year sentence, one that he realizes is justified.  James Gandolfini brings a smarmy arrogance to his role as the commandant who smoozes all over Redford on his initial meeting, but then when Redford makes note of the fact that Gandolfini has never served time out on the battlefield, Gandolfini's jealousy prompts him to treat Redford just as he does everyone else!  When several inmates inform Redford of some highly suspicious deaths, he decides to lead them in a takeover of the prison.The supporting cast is brilliant: Mark Ruffalo, Delroy Lindo, Steve Burton, Paul Calderon, Samuel Ball, Jeremy Childs, Clifton Collins jr. and Brian Goodman among them.Director Rod Lurie (The Contender) keeps things going and the climax battle is a doozy!A wonderful film that is both inspirational and thought-provoking.

Winter is a man who has never seen combat, and when Irwin sneeks a peek at Winter's battlefield memorabilia, that's when we know that they won't be seeing eye to eye for a long time. The other inmates, among them are Mark Ruffalo as the prison booky, Yates, decide to go to the general about the treatment of the prison. And that's when the real war begins! General Irwin rallied up the other prisoners into taking over the prison as a result of protesting the sadistic colonel/warden's abuse of his power. In a way, it's World War III...but inside of a prison! ""The Last Castle"" has it all, action, drama, great storytelling, and a top-notch cast that's hard to beat!

590262,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00005JKNU,"""qmlhcb""","[3, 3]","On its surface, The Last Castle is an enjoyable action flick carrying some meaningful messages. But upon closer scrutiny, there's not much below that surface.The story is definitely an entertaining one. Robert Redford plays a court martialed three-star general entering prison, where he comes into conflict with a manipulative warden played by James Gandolfini who enjoys making life as difficult as possible for his inmates.It's easy for many to mistakenly label this flick as a masterpiece. It has all the right pieces, internal and external conflicts, symbolism, a great cast and wonderful cinematography. But it just doesn't use them as masterful as it could.Two things really bugged me. One was the manipulative film score. Now I'm all for grand majestic film scores such as Star Wars, or Braveheart - when appropriate - but when they stop impressing a certain mood and cross the line to blatantly declare ""hey, you have to feel really moved here! The music demands it!"" it gets to be a distraction. This film doesn't call for a majestic score, it's a prison drama and deserves something more subtle. Let the acting speak for itself, both Robert Redford and James Gandolfini are great. They don't need manipulative music to express their emotions.The second thing was the film went too far to explain its symbolism. The idea of the prison being a castle is great, and the film makes a number of analogies between prisoners and medieval soldiers, (which really work well since this is a military prison). But instead of letting the audience figure all the symbolism out themselves, everything is fully explained. No repeat viewings are necessary to catch all the ideas and metaphors used, it's like watching the movie with the director next to you explaining ""yeah, here this scene represents... blah blah blah."" Figuring it all out is half the fun of a good movie, and part of what makes repeat viewings entertaining.The Last Castle also seems to take a lot of visual ideas from one of the the greatest prison dramas: The Shawshank Redemption. I'm not sure, but I think they may have even used the same old-style prison. So many of the shots, along with many story elements, are identical to shots in The Shawshank Redemption.But despite these flaws, The Last Castle is still a very entertaining film. The acting is great, the drama is all there and the action sequence at the end is spectacular. It's just too bad this one didn't rise above the popcorn flick level, because it sure had the potential.",4,"A great popcorn flick, but could have been more",1034553600,"10 14, 2002",2002,2506,"['surface', 'Last', 'Castle', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'flick', 'carrying', 'meaningful', 'messages', 'closer', 'scrutiny', 'not', 'much', 'surface.The', 'story', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'one', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'court', 'martialed', 'three-star', 'general', 'entering', 'prison', 'where', 'conflict', 'manipulative', 'warden', 'played', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'making', 'life', 'as', 'difficult', 'possible', 'inmates.It', 'easy', 'many', 'mistakenly', 'label', 'flick', 'masterpiece', 'right', 'pieces', 'internal', 'external', 'conflicts', 'symbolism', 'great', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'just', ""n't"", 'use', 'as', 'masterful', 'things', 'really', 'bugged', 'One', 'was', 'manipulative', 'film', 'score', 'Now', ""'m"", 'grand', 'majestic', 'film', 'scores', 'such', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Braveheart', 'when', 'appropriate', 'when', 'stop', 'impressing', 'certain', 'mood', 'cross', 'line', 'blatantly', 'declare', 'hey', 'have', 'feel', 'really', 'moved', 'here', 'music', 'be', 'distraction', 'film', ""n't"", 'call', 'majestic', 'score', 'prison', 'drama', 'something', 'more', 'subtle', 'Let', 'acting', 'speak', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'are', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'manipulative', 'music', 'express', 'emotions.The', 'second', 'thing', 'was', 'film', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'explain', 'symbolism', 'idea', 'prison', 'being', 'castle', 'great', 'film', 'number', 'analogies', 'prisoners', 'medieval', 'soldiers', 'really', 'work', 'well', 'military', 'prison', 'instead', 'letting', 'audience', 'figure', 'symbolism', 'everything', 'fully', 'explained', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'are', 'necessary', 'catch', 'ideas', 'metaphors', 'used', 'watching', 'movie', 'director', 'explaining', 'yeah', 'here', 'scene', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Figuring', 'out', 'fun', 'good', 'movie', 'part', 'what', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'entertaining.The', 'Last', 'Castle', 'also', 'take', 'lot', 'visual', 'ideas', 'one', 'greatest', 'prison', 'dramas', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'used', 'same', 'old-style', 'prison', 'So', 'many', 'shots', 'many', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'identical', 'shots', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption.But', 'flaws', 'Last', 'Castle', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'acting', 'great', 'drama', 'there', 'action', 'sequence', 'end', 'spectacular', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'rise', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'level', 'sure', 'had', 'potential']",N/A

Gandolfini is the brutal military prison warden, who orders the death of a soldier/prisoner, inciting Redford to lead the men in revolt.The problem is both men are cut from the same cloth, as the script poorly distinguishes them.  This complexity is useful, but not when neither character is worth rooting for.  The most telling scene is when a reluctant follower asks the ex-General if leading men is just moving pieces on a chessboard to him.  Redford answers it is, and we infer this is 'the burden of command,' his book on warfare, i.e. the ends justify the means in battle.  It is hard to become a pawn for the great military machine, when the cause is unjust or not worth the price.  Here, the men can just follow the severe code versus revolt.  While Gandolfini's warden goes too far, his justification of needing order is reasonable.He tries to get Redford shipped out on mental issues, delusions of taking command.  The problem is, Redford really does what the Warden says shows mental infirmity.  As if he cant adjust to not commanding thousands, he invents a battle.  The battle seems as much about the General's need to command troops and teach the Warden a lesson as anything else.  No real reason was given as to why his personal connections could not have fixed the prison problems, and they were already going that way as Redford met with the Warden's superior, who 'put him on notice.'In addition to poor character development, taking one step back the whole basis and execution of conflict in a prison yard is laughable.  Last, the ending is so insipid, everyone who sees it will think of 5 ways it could have ended more intelligently.  The film instead tries to make a tearjerker when no such ending was needed or justified.A great film of the evil nature of man's institutions is One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.

590266,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B00005JKNU,Scott,"[2, 3]","I'm glad I saw this film on HBO instead of paying money to rent it. While it was moderately entertaining, I wouldn't be interested in adding it to my home movie collection. The film starts out with two incidents that it fails to follow up on. The first is a fight in the military prison between two inmates. The music and fight leads you to believe that this will be like a lot of prison films: people leading very hard lives, getting beat up on a daily basis, and having to fight to survive. There was virtually none of this. None of the prisoners are the least bit scary, and you expect them to hug each other by the final scene. Robert Redford is immediately given respect for being a general, and doesn't have to earn anything for himself.The second surprise is that Redford's situation is left a mystery until halfway through the film. It's alluded to several times early on that he is a 3 star general and he doesn't deserve to be in prison. When it is finally revealed why he is in prison, it is a letdown. You're expecting it to be a fairly prominent part of the film, and he's portrayed as someone who doesn't deserve to be there. The director brushes over the explanation and the viewer learns that Redford, like every other prisoner, DESERVES to be in jail. This makes it very difficult to root for him when he decides to lead a gang of murderers and prisoners in an uprising against the warden.The other main problem with this film, is that Gandolfini doesn't come off as a very bad character. Unlike the classic prison movies, you have a prisoner who deserves to be in jail, fighting against a warden who is supposed to be evil, but is never developed fully enough to show this.The whole time through the end of this movie, I kept thinking, these guys are killing innocent American soldiers who were stationed at the prison and are simply following orders. While not many are killed, there are definitely a couple who go down permanently. I'm supposed to be excited about this?Overall, a lackluster hero, a weak villain, and a lack of a single escape attempt makes this a very weak prison movie.

Kerwick,"[4, 4]","In the absence of a wonderful performance by James Gandolfini, this would be just one more of the formulaic, cookie-cutter Hollywood prison movies. The plot is more than familiar, if not outright predictable: ""the guards are sadists and criminals; the prisoners are victims and the heroes; society can only be saved by the role reversal that their insurrection involves, you know the rest."" The earliest version of this I can recall is Birdman of Alcatraz, but the genre probably goes back to Victor Hugo, if not further. Unfortunately, Redford isn't Burt Lancaster, and his character isn't Jean Valjean. Nonetheless, it's the average Redford performance: lots of closeups and little acting - not awful, but nothing worth comment. James Gandolfini, however, although a comparative newcomer to major Hollywood productions, shows just what fine acting can be and displays more dramatic range in his role than Redford has in his entire career.

In my opinion, FWIW(for what it's worth), these two guys have been and still are the greatest. I doubt anyone will come close to filling their shoes. I thought the acting was okay in the movie but the plot was a little lacking.  Overall, this movie is so much better than some I've watched lately, that I have to say I enjoyed watching it.  I rented another movie at the same time I rented &quot;The Last Castle&quot;. Ben Kingsley played in some stupid mafia movie that I turned off after about the first fifteen minutes,wondering how the movie ever managed to get produced in the first place.  Thus, at the time this caused me to think Redford's movie was probably a 5-star by comparsion.  It wasn't until later after I'd thought about the Redford movie that I realized it wasn't a 5-star at all.

This means you can guess quite well what will be the next step and who will be ""sacrificed for the cause"". The movie is a combination of the ""sport"" genre where a group of (football/basketball... etc.) losers is trained by the has-been coach which succeeds in overcoming his own problems and making the bunch of losers into a real winning team (lesson # 1 - working together is important) and the prison movie genre - which always starts with its message of ""mind your own business"" - and hence the conflict of these two messages until the clear victory of one message  - yes, you guessed right.But I do not mean to be cynical. The movie is captivating and you are very much interested to know what will happen to General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford), a decorated war hero sent to a 10 year sentence in a military jail and if he is going to survive the first weeks in prison and not hang himself as the other inmates anticipate and gamble on.  We are very much interested to find out what will happen to the dynamics between Irwin and the prisoners he joins. Also, what did Irwin do to get himself in prison? The answer is only a little revealed through the movie - yet not in full. The fact that Irwin is in prison does not harm viewers and inmates perception of Irwin as a leader and a war hero and the guess is that the reason for his being in prison has something to do with a moral dilemma after which he has decided to ""mind his own business"" from now on.  Robert Redford is Robert Redford. No surprises here. He plays a very rational, somewhat bitter and quite truthful person who knows how to hold himself well in all situations. Irwin is indeed a leader and Redford is able to project his quiet strong power which has the prisoners following him. However, not a surprising figure for Redford and not a lot different then his previous roles.Playing opposite Redford is Gandolfini as Colonel Winter, the prisoner warden - one that is no real match for General Irwin. Winter gains power by fear and punishment while Irwin gains power by respect . Gandolfini does play a different character then the one we usually see him in. Whereas in the Sopranos his heavy physique and gestures are taken as intimidating and menacing and yet he manages to remain loveable and even humorous, there is nothing humorous about Warden Winter. Throughout the movie we see him deteriorating until his last cover is exposed for what he really is.

590276,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKNU,Tsuyoshi,"[16, 16]","Director Rod Lurie's follow-up of ""The Contender"" raises his  patriotic tone higher than before, and gives an intriguging setting of the film, but as he did before, sacrifices its potentially complex nature of patriotism.  Instead of making full use of the interesting situation, ""The Last Castle"" goes in a very familar territory where many previous prison dramas have treaded before.  But ... here's an irony ... the film is very engaging and entertaining as the latter.Robert Redford is General Irwin (and three-star general), who disobeyed a direct order from the President and was found guilty at court marshal.  Irwin, now stripped of his honor, is sent to the prison where Col. Winter (James Gandolfini) maneges with strict rules.  At first, Irwin was thinking of nothing but ""doing time, and going home,"" dreaming of the day (ten years ahead) when he can play chess with his still unseen grandson.  But the situation around him, which is so severe for some inmates of the prison, wakes up something in Irwin: his anger against injustice.  With his leadership, the convicted men, once deprived of pride, now believe that he is the man to rely on, and start to follow him.In 1980, Robert Redford was in a similar (but with a totally diffrent tone) film called ""Brubaker.""  If you remember that, or have the fresh memory of ""Shawshank"" and many other dramas set in prison, it is not hard for you to guess the development of the story.  I must say here that for all its predictable plot, ""The Last Castle"" never fails to grab your attention.  After all, Redford is always good at playing this type of hero, and Gandolfini supplies us exactly the kind of man who should be despised and ridiculed.  Delroy Lindo's cameo gives a fresh air at the right moment, and you also got an uncredited appearance of one famous actress R.W. (or R.W.P.) as Irwin's daughter.However, some might find problems right with those things -- Redford did too many roles like this in the past back from the  1970s, and he can do it while sleeping.  Gandolfini pumps up his acting, and probably that is suitable for this kind of person, but if you have seen ""The Mexican"" (and yes, ""The Sopranos"") you know he can do it better than that, and could have shown more complicated side of the character.  Inexplicably, Col. Winter seems to have his say at some moment (when he talks about his predecessor), but he is not allowed to do that.  That is manipulating, some might say, considering the difficult nature of his job at prison.  I agree with them.There are even swell action scenes; there is a character who you judge soon is going to get killed, and you judge it right.  There are many elements we find in prison dramas, and if you complain them, you will dislike the film.  Your complaint is justified; only, you just have to forget it, to enjoy the drama which is in itself very gripping.  But talking about the ""waving flag,"" I just don't think that the US military system needs drastic events of this magnitude.See this one as a good textbook about the quality of leadership, and as an absorbing tale of men and their pride.

The inmates ask Redford for help in getting Gandolfini removed from the prison.  He initially refuses, but later capitulates and becomes their leader.  Redford becomes their de facto leader and they decide to take over the prison in order to get Gandofini removed.  The acting is alright, although Gandolfini spends most of the film glowering in his office and Redford just stands around looking stoic.
