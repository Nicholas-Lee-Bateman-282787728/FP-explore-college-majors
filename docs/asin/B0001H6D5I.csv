I have also watched and enjoyed the remake; however, I enjoyed the original much more. Even though the sets and special effects of the first production are limited by the older film technology the original is still best in my book.Most impressive for its day were the combination of sets, flats and studio paintings used to represent the huge monument-like four sided video screen on which the latest ""news"" was presented to crowds screaming ""Long live Big Brother"" while standing in the streets in awe of his image (above the larger than life words ""WAR IS PEACE"", ""FREEDOM IS SLAVERY"" and ""IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH"").One writer has written in to observe that ""Some of this story's predictions have come true in odd ways. Big Brother's cameras track us every day, in banks and stores, along streets and highways and even from home webcams..."". I agree with this statement but offer further the fact that the future work stations of the ""outer party"" members have also come to pass with the standard small office cubicle having full Internet access that we toil away in every day.Much of this movie offers fresh food for thought and consideration of the following story elements: a war that continues endlessly to maintain control of the population, a government that spies on its citizens, torture endorsed and practiced on enemies of the state, the rewriting of history by the ministry of truth, state control of the press as well as the mind set of many of its citizens.

Still, the movie is loyal to Orwell's creation and -- having been made in Great Britain in 1956 at the height of European communism -- brings a far more potent and immediate sense of fear than that tepid remake from the 1980s.This movie features a number of stars -- Edmund O'Brien as the hero Smith, Jan Sterling as his love interest, Michael Redgrave as his boss that eventually turns him in, and a young Donald Pleasance as his friend that also meets the same fate. A highly dramatic musical score from British composer Malcolm Arnold underlines the potent story.The pace of the film varies between deadly dull and extreme nervousness while the overwhelming cinematic aura is film noir. I think this may be from poor technical detailing in the 1950s as well as a poor transfer from original film to DVD.None of this diminishes the importance of this film as a point in time reference to intolerance and authoritarism in post World War II Europe. Indeed, the voiceover at the beginning and end of the film explains how our liberty is under attack and why we must be vigilent in protecting freedom.If you read Orwell's timeless book and saw the inferior remake, it's time you see this version to get a better idea of how people actually thought about this kind of terror when communism was a menace throughout the continent.

I can't compare it to other versions, but I do appreciate that it is reflective of the view of future technologies held during that era in which the book was conceived.As for the transfer, it's generally acceptable. The image is somewhat soft (the larger the screen, the more obvious the fuzziness) and, throughout the film, there appears to be video static lines at the very bottom of the frame (something you'd expect to see when watching a VHS tape that is slightly mis-tracking). Therefore, since this title probably has fallen into the Public Domain, I am assuming that this quite likely has been transferred from video tape. Had this been in color, I'm sure the copy would have looked even worse.The DVD-R is divided into chapters, however there is no scene selection option (in fact, there is no menu at all). Although originally released by Columbia Pictures, the beginning and end of the film identify it as a Screen Gems release (the television distribution subsidiary of Columbia Pictures). There is nothing on the packaging to indicate the origin of this DVD-R. In any event, I'm confident that this is NOT one of the burn-on-demand, studio produced DVD-Rs that are available elsewhere on Amazon.One other point, The cover art (same as displayed on Amazon) indicates the inclusion of an ""Old-Time Radio Show,"" but it does not appear to have made it to the disc; it only contains the video for the movie. BTW, in real life, the cover art looks like a mediocre-quality photo-copy.In summary, since this title is not readily available, if you really want to watch it, you might consider this worth the price. However, if I had it to do over, for the extra few bucks I would have gotten the dual version (1954/1956) DVD (even though the quality is reportedly no better).",3,Great Movie; Passable Transfer,1301961600,"04 5, 2011",2011,2013,"['rating', 'review', 'are', 'primarily', 'product', 'not', 'content', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'enjoyable', 'translation', 'film', 'novel', 'had', 'wide', 'spread', 'popularity', 'generation', 'back', '1950', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'other', 'versions', 'do', 'appreciate', 'reflective', 'view', 'future', 'technologies', 'held', 'era', 'book', 'was', 'conceived.As', 'transfer', 'generally', 'acceptable', 'image', 'somewhat', 'soft', 'larger', 'screen', 'more', 'obvious', 'fuzziness', 'film', 'be', 'video', 'static', 'lines', 'very', 'bottom', 'frame', 'something', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'when', 'watching', 'VHS', 'tape', 'slightly', 'mis-tracking', 'Therefore', 'title', 'probably', 'fallen', 'Public', 'Domain', 'am', 'assuming', 'quite', 'likely', 'been', 'transferred', 'video', 'tape', 'Had', 'been', 'color', ""'m"", 'sure', 'copy', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'even', 'worse.The', 'DVD-R', 'divided', 'chapters', 'however', 'scene', 'selection', 'option', 'fact', 'menu', 'originally', 'released', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'identify', 'Screen', 'Gems', 'release', 'television', 'distribution', 'subsidiary', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'nothing', 'packaging', 'indicate', 'origin', 'DVD-R', 'event', ""'m"", 'confident', 'NOT', 'one', 'burn-on-demand', 'studio', 'produced', 'DVD-Rs', 'are', 'available', 'elsewhere', 'Amazon.One', 'other', 'point', 'cover', 'art', 'same', 'displayed', 'Amazon', 'inclusion', 'Old-Time', 'Radio', 'Show', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'made', 'disc', 'only', 'video', 'movie', 'BTW', 'real', 'life', 'cover', 'art', 'mediocre-quality', 'photo-copy.In', 'summary', 'title', 'not', 'readily', 'available', 'really', 'want', 'watch', 'might', 'consider', 'worth', 'price', 'However', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'extra', 'few', 'bucks', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'dual', 'version', '1954/1956', 'DVD', 'even', 'quality', 'reportedly', 'better']",N/A

It was done years before the actual year 1984, and I saw it when I was about ten years old and it made a powerful impression on me. The other was made in that very year, in London.

Oceania and the rest were built on the glowing rubble of that war.Michael Anderson directed this very compelling version of Winston Smith, the Everyman in that world. It's a world where people searched daily, in their own homes - display of pockets and briefcase content in front of the flickering but unblinking monitor lenses. His work is in rewriting history, to make sure everything turned out the way Big Brother says that it did, and rewriting again tomorrow to conform to the new past.This movie form of Orwell's book does take some liberties with the story, but none that matter. Winston and his lover are captured. Their thoughtcrime is too serious for matters like trial, and the sentence is immediate. They don't deserve execution in that world, instead they are crushed into Big Brother's mold and converted. This is not a movie with a happy ending. At the time it was written, though, it was a very believable ending.Some of this story's predictions have some true, in odd ways. Big Brother's cameras track us every day, in banks and stores, along streets and highways, and even from home webcams. Oddly, the futuristic dome-towers of Orwell's Ministry buildings in London also came true in the Swiss Re building, the ""gherkin."".In other ways, though, the 1950s sensibilities of the movie look stale to a modern audience. A newer version of the movie emphasized the grit and damage of a bombed-out world, impoverished by the costs of its weapons, but this was a relatively clean kind of place. The newer production also suggested the physical decay caused by imprisonment under Big Brother, but this Winston came out looking reasonably well-fed and dapper. The 1956 Winston was a crushed man, too, but our eyes have changed since this movie was made.Still, it's a classic rendering of a classic cautionary story. It's a strong portrayal of a dystopia that could still happen, even though calendar year 1984 has come and gone. And, like Orwell's original, it ends on a note in which hope is not just gone, but forgotten.//wiredweird",5,Orwell's nightmare future.,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,2135,"['1956', 'vision', 'scenes', 'recurring', 'nightmare', 'time', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Oceania', 'rest', 'were', 'built', 'glowing', 'rubble', 'war.Michael', 'Anderson', 'directed', 'very', 'compelling', 'version', 'Winston', 'Smith', 'Everyman', 'world', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'searched', 'daily', 'own', 'homes', 'display', 'pockets', 'briefcase', 'content', 'front', 'flickering', 'unblinking', 'monitor', 'lenses', 'work', 'rewriting', 'history', 'make', 'sure', 'everything', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'Big', 'Brother', 'did', 'rewriting', 'again', 'tomorrow', 'conform', 'new', 'past.This', 'movie', 'form', 'Orwell', 'book', 'take', 'liberties', 'story', 'none', 'matter', 'Winston', 'lover', 'are', 'captured', 'thoughtcrime', 'too', 'serious', 'matters', 'trial', 'sentence', 'immediate', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'execution', 'world', 'instead', 'are', 'crushed', 'Big', 'Brother', 'mold', 'converted', 'not', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'time', 'was', 'written', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'ending.Some', 'story', 'predictions', 'have', 'true', 'odd', 'ways', 'Big', 'Brother', 'cameras', 'track', 'day', 'banks', 'stores', 'streets', 'highways', 'even', 'home', 'webcams', 'Oddly', 'futuristic', 'dome-towers', 'Orwell', 'Ministry', 'buildings', 'London', 'also', 'came', 'true', 'Swiss', 'Re', 'building', 'gherkin', 'other', 'ways', 'though', '1950s', 'sensibilities', 'movie', 'look', 'stale', 'modern', 'audience', 'newer', 'version', 'movie', 'emphasized', 'grit', 'damage', 'bombed-out', 'world', 'impoverished', 'costs', 'weapons', 'was', 'relatively', 'clean', 'kind', 'place', 'newer', 'production', 'also', 'suggested', 'physical', 'decay', 'caused', 'imprisonment', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Winston', 'came', 'out', 'looking', 'reasonably', 'well-fed', 'dapper', '1956', 'Winston', 'was', 'crushed', 'man', 'too', 'eyes', 'have', 'changed', 'movie', 'was', 'made.Still', 'classic', 'rendering', 'classic', 'cautionary', 'story', 'strong', 'portrayal', 'dystopia', 'could', 'still', 'happen', 'even', 'calendar', 'year', '1984', 'come', 'gone', 'Orwell', 'original', 'note', 'hope', 'not', 'just', 'gone', 'forgotten.//wiredweird']",N/A
