This movie combines Ashton Kutcher with Seann William Scott (American Pie fame) in the lead roles as ""stoners"" who forgot what happened last night. On their journey to discover the past, they find an interesing trail of money, women, aliens and other strange people/characters. Let's not forget that Jennifer Garner appears in the movie as a girlfriend. We specially liked the 5 alien women in the black jumpsuits. A wild, funny, odd and interesting movie.

535351,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXS7,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The fact that this movie is funny kind of scares me a bit.  It's one of those movies that is so awfully repetitive and ridiculously ludicrous and yet so over-the-top you can't help but fully immerse in its stupidity.It's funny; no ifs, ands or buts.The films plot if outrageous.  Two stoner slacker kids named Jesse and Chester (I've always liked that name for some reason) wake up totally oblivious to the events of the night before.  When they walk outside to find Jesse's car missing they set off on an adventure to find it, which leads them to aliens and ostriches (err, lamas) and gigantic chicks in bikinis.I can't believe I'm giving this film a B-!With one ridiculous scenario after another, `Dude, Where's My Car?' kind of solidifies itself as one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, but it's no where near the worst because, in all of its preposterousness, it knows what it's trying to do and it does it well.  I'm not really a fan of Ashton Kutcher or Seann William Scott (Scott was hilarious in `Role Models', but I find his `American Pie' stint hugely overrated) but they sell the `dumb good looking' character very well here.  The endless run on some of the gags can get a tad annoying (that whole tattoo scene may be the most quotable, but it is also the most obnoxious) but then again, at times the repetition is what makes it so funny (the Chinese drive thru scene gets me every time).If you want smart and funny, get far away from this film...but if you want just plain funny, pop this in an enjoy.And then...",4,"It's stupid, but it wants to be...",1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,1528,"['fact', 'movie', 'funny', 'kind', 'scares', 'bit', 'one', 'movies', 'so', 'awfully', 'repetitive', 'ridiculously', 'ludicrous', 'yet', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fully', 'immerse', 'stupidity.It', 'funny', 'ifs', 'buts.The', 'films', 'plot', 'outrageous', 'Two', 'stoner', 'slacker', 'kids', 'named', 'Jesse', 'Chester', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'name', 'reason', 'wake', 'up', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'events', 'night', 'before', 'When', 'walk', 'find', 'Jesse', 'car', 'missing', 'set', 'off', 'adventure', 'find', 'aliens', 'ostriches', 'err', 'lamas', 'gigantic', 'chicks', 'bikinis.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film', 'B-', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'scenario', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'kind', 'solidifies', 'one', 'dumbest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'where', 'worst', 'because', 'preposterousness', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'Scott', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Role', 'Models', 'find', 'American', 'Pie', 'stint', 'hugely', 'overrated', 'sell', 'dumb', 'good', 'looking', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'endless', 'run', 'gags', 'can', 'get', 'tad', 'annoying', 'tattoo', 'scene', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'quotable', 'also', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'then', 'again', 'times', 'repetition', 'what', 'so', 'funny', 'Chinese', 'drive', 'thru', 'scene', 'time', '.If', 'want', 'smart', 'funny', 'get', 'far', 'away', 'film', 'want', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'pop', 'enjoy.And', 'then']","Dude, Where's My Car?"

That's bad - but it gets worse.  I thought this movie was funny.  I actually enjoyed watched this ode to stupidity.  Make no mistake about it - Dude, Where's My Car? is as stupid a movie as you could ever dream of.  If it's stupid, and someone (probably a stoner) has thought of it, it's in this movie.Here's the rundown.  Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott), two total losers, wake up one morning without any memories of what they did the night before.  Obviously, they were wasted - but what else is new?  As the day progresses, they discover more and more clues about their wild doings the night before: they partied at their girlfriends' (Marla Sokoloff and a pre-Alias Jennifer Garner) now-thoroughly-trashed house, Jesse got to at least second base with Christie Boner (Kristy Swanson), they spent some quality time down at the Kit Kat Club, and they lost their car.  Oh yeah, they also got their hands on some type of powerful alien device, walked off with a suitcase full of money belonging to a gender-challenged stripper, and threw that money around like it was the night before the apocalypse.  Now their girlfriends are mad at them, a group of cultist freaks and two sets of aliens are after the alien device, the mixed-up stripper wants her, uh his, money back, and the local tough guys are revving up for an old-fashioned stoner-bashing.  All the boys really want is to find their dadgummed car, get the anniversary gifts they assume they bought over to their girlfriends so they can enjoy a special treat, and possibly enjoy the pleasure a group of ugly hot chick aliens promise them in return for the alien device.Some of the things you'll find in this movie are cultists dressed in bubble wrap spacesuits, two weird Swedish aliens, alien chicks who dress like Robert Palmer dancers, ostriches on the attack, a pot-smoking dog, and of course a fifty-foot tall alien.  It really is the most ridiculous script I've ever seen.  Dude, Where's My Car? makes the Bill and Ted movies look like installments of Masterpiece Theatre.  I really, really wish I could tell you how much I hated the whole movie-watching experience - but, alas, I cannot.

535372,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00003CXS7,darragh o'donoghue,"[1, 1]","'Dude, Where's My Car?' pulls off the difficult trick of at once indulging the (let's be kind) 'limited' worldview of its stoner protagonists and mercilessly ribbing it.  The film is the perfect expression of a particular stunted adolescent mindset, revolving entirely around parties, TV, soft drugs, caricatures of girls, cars, nerd-baiting and jock-evading, fast food and aliens, going round and round in circles.  The heroes, as vacuous as Bill and Ted, and as crass as Beavis and Butthead, have a naive charm, exuberance and sheer good-natured good-humour that carries the film long after the material has run out (about a third of the way through).  The leads have an infectious and believable bond, and I woulld travel anywhere to see the marvel that is Seann William Scott's big grin, part-lascivious, part-wide-eyed-wonder, how-the-hell-did-I-get-here-and-who-cares?I won't say it's necessarily bad faith on the part of the film-makers, but there is certainly a relentless undermining of the characters' worldview.  The film is less about male camaraderie than male identity, and takes the form of a journey that promises a moral progress, in which boys become men.  All the way through, the film plays with various sexual situations 'testing' the boys, from homosexuality to castration anxiety to deferred heterosexuality.  Famous quest narratives are ironically invoked, from 'Jason and the Argonauts' to 'The Life Of Brian', with the car perhaps as an emblem of the mature masculinity or sexuality that is the boys' birthright but which has to be sought.  The lack of 'realism' (where do they go to school? etc.), the profusion of fairy tale, magical, hallucinatory and dream motifs, all suggest this.  The venerable plot starting point - amnesiacs moving in the present, trying to recover their past - is the clasic narrative of identity, one which has served the likes of 'Vertigo' and 'Mulholland Drive' well.

But that doesn't mean it's not fun.There's the most basic of plots: Jesse and Chester, two stoners whose vocabulary consists of relentless utterings of &quot;dude&quot; and &quot;sweet,&quot; wake up one morning to realize that Jesse's car is missing, and they have no recollection of the previous night. As they set out to find the car, they begin to piece together the silly, unbelievably outrageous events of the previous night, from a tryst in a strip club with a transsexual stripper who gave them a suitcase full of cash, to encounters with different groups of nerdy, busty, and macho aliens, all demanding from them a device known as the continuum transfunctioner.And that's it, the entire plot of the movie, mixed in with some truly hearty laughs and some good yet goofy acting from two guys who know what they're doing. The movie works for the simple reason that Ashton Kutcher (Jesse) and Seann William Scott (Chester) do such a good job of acting completely stupid that they sell us on the whole stoner appearance of the movie. A film like this can't work without the mentality to back it up, and the absence of that mentality is just what it needs.There are laughs, and while some of them are forced, there are those that succeeded in getting more than just a chuckle out of me. The two guys' mentality is one gag, but the movie also makes us laugh by playing their girlfriends, known as &quot;The Twins,&quot; to be just as air-headed as they are. A chinese fast food drive-thru results in an hilarious explosion of anger, while the whole girls-with-big-hoo-hoos mentality runs throughout.There's really not a whole lot more to say about this movie... it's stupid, it's ridiculous... it makes its characters out to be heroes in the most contrived situations imaginable, and there's no shortage of brainless dialogue and actions.

535382,A138826JMC0J3T,B00003CXS7,E. Batica,"[1, 2]","Dude Where's My Car is a pretty good &quot;dumb funny&quot; movie. It's not as dumb funny as DUMB AND DUMBER or BASEKETBALL but for what it is, it's makes you laugh. It stars American Pie's Sean William Scott as Chester and That 70's Show's Ashton Kutcher as Jesse.Jesse and Chester are your typical dumb teenage, pizza delivery boys that after a night of serious partying, THEY CAN'T REMEMBER a thing. The next day they come to realize that it's their anniversary with their girlfriends. When they try to go over and make good with their girlfriends, they realize that Jesse's car is missing and inside were the gifts they got their girlfriends. Throughout their mission to find Jesse's car, they come to find out that the night of their partying, the came into contact with 2 aliens that had a device that keeps the universe in harmony and it's lost! It's up to Jesse and Chester t ofind the Continuam Transfunctioner, give it to the gurdians of the Transfunctioner and save the universe (and of course along the way, piece together their aweome night of partying!)First off, you can't go into this movie with a whole lot of expectations. The story is just really silly and you're not going to get an Oscar performance from this movie. You are however going to get a lot of laughs because that's really what you're getting for this one. And normally most comedies are straight forward but this one has little twists in the story here and there and that keeps some interest in it.I'd recommend this one because it's funny. Truthfully, it is funny but if you're looking for drop down funny, there are better movies that you could go for. If you feel that you couldn't get into this movie, you can't go wrong with the AMERICAN PIE series, ME MYSELF &amp; IRENE or even any of the Kevin Smith films like MALLRATS or CLERKS (you chose to go with Kevin Smith, watch CLERKS first).

The film goes one step beyond and then some.  Aston Kutcher plays Jesse, a character who's a bit smarter than the character of &quot;Kelso&quot; that Aston portrays on &quot;That 70's Show&quot;.  I'm a &quot;That 70's Show&quot; fan, which is one of the reasons why I bought this movie.  Anyway, Jesse &amp; Chester (Seann William Scott) wake up, completely forgetting what they did the night before (&quot;How wasted were we?&quot;) and discovering some very strange things, such as a refrigerator full of Pudding Cups, and of course, the fact that Jesse's car is missing.  The most fun you'll have with this movie is your first time viewing, since you know as much as they do as far as what the heck is going on!  The film has its moments, including Jesse arguing with a Chinese drivethru intercom. (&quot;NO AND THEN!!!!&quot;) The Shibby smoking dog was a touch much for me, but the one scene I cringe at the most is when Jesse &amp; Chester make out with one another just so they can impress....get this...FABIO!  Not the best moment of the movie.  But it is full of zany characters.  The most sexist name in the film has got to be &quot;Christie Boner&quot;.  She's the one who tells Jesse she saw his car...&quot;from the backseat&quot;.  These guys do have girlfriends, Wendy and Wilma (The Twins), who honestly, they don't deserve.  (&quot;You are such sucky boyfriends&quot;.)  Why don't they deserve them?  Well the night before they trashed the twins house and after the girls cleaned it all up they ruined it again, although unintentioanlly.  I don't want to give too much away in case readers of this review have never seen the movie, as to not ruin it for them.  It is pretty crazy.  Guys will love what one woman does with Aston's popsicle.  The movie reminds me of &quot;Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot;, only not as funny.  That doesn't mean you won't have a good time though.  And I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it because I did.  Judge for yourself.  It truly is one wild ride.  SWEET!  DUDE!The DVD Extras are OK.  Some extended scenes show you a little more and I think they were right to take them out.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[4, 9]","Riding high on the tide of American Pie's success came a truckload of stoner, gross-out comedies that never manages to be halfway as good as the sort of movies they were trying to imitate.  Dude, Where's My Car? is one such example.  Starring Ashton Kucher and Sean William Scott as two losers who set out to find their car after a heavy night of drinking the night before.  The big problem is though, not that they've lost their car, but their anniversary presents for their girlfriends were in the car too.Of course, sitting down to watch a film like this you don't really expect anything other than entertainment.  Unfortunately, this is anything but.  Each dead gag is laid as quickly on top of the last one as possible to try and avoid the fact that there's really nothing here at all.  Sexy alien women, an absurb cult, an angry transexual and a pot-smoking dog are just some of the bizarre plot elements that are thrown at the stars, but you just couldn't care less.  It's a shame really, because this kind of movie can be a lot of fun, but unfortunately this just reeks of a half-baked effort.  It's even more shameful that the film-makers have managed to enlist two obviously talented comedy actors in Kucher and Scott.  Though Kucher may now be simply known as Demi Moore's new beau, and as soon as you see Scott you think of Stifler, their vacant expressions and key-on delivery would've worked perfectly for a better film.Finally, you can't help comparing Dude, Where's My Car? to other's of its ilk.  It lacks the inherent charm of American Pie (and it's nowhere near as funny), the off-kilter comedy of Detroit Rock City and is certainly nowhere near as good as the Farrelly's There's Something About Mary.

In truth, of course it is, but the story that develops is actually pretty decent and a lot better than you would think initially.THE STORY:Chester (Sean William Scott, ""American Pie"" series, ""Road Trip"") and Jessie (Ashton Keaton) are two stoner buds who wake up from a night of partying with NO MEMORY of what they did over night.  As the movie progresses it is slowly revealed that they had quite the night becoming mixed up with a transvestite striper, purchasing all types of stuff and even becoming caught up in the middle of an intergalactic battle between good and evil!!!  In the midst of it all, they must also battle to save their relationships with their twin girlfriends and, of course, find Jessie's missing car.Best Scenes:- the blind boy meeting the alien chick- the Ostrich farm- Chinese take-out- ZOLTAN!!!!THE DVD FEATURES:The DVD is actually chalked full of some great extras, including:- Feature Length Commentary with the director, Sean William Scott and Ashton Kutcher:  This commentary's about average/above average from most feature length commentary.  Very entertaining to listen to as all three are pretty funny.- 5 Minute Featurette with Sean William Scott, Ashton Kutcher and Kristy Swanson (Christie Boner):  Not bad for 5 minutes.  They show some of the ""behind-the-scenes"" stuff and talk about the movie's plot.  It basically looks like some quick commercial they aired on E! or something.- Movie Trailer and TV Commercial Spots:  The usual.  Nice extra.- 7 Extended Scenes:  Going a little beyond the ""deleted scene"" extras they actually show the full scenes as it was originally filmed with the deleted footage still in.  Overall, some of the deleted footage was pretty cool and would have actually added some to the story, but ultimately did not make a huge difference being left out anyway.In all, the DVD extras are a great and worthy bonus.THE VERDICT:If you're looking for a ""dumb but funny, yet slightly intelligent"" comedy, this is the ticket for you.  Chalk full of laughs, some mindless fun and a pretty decent storyline this movie should be a pleaser to just about anyone.  The DVD extras are a pleasant added bonus as well making this a great rental, OR, if you liked the movie enough and are so inclined, a decent addition to your DVD collection....",5,Actually a Pretty Decent Story&#65533;Lot Better Than You&#65533;d Think,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,2396,"['first', 'glance', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'will', 'probably', 'hit', 'one', 'dumb', 'funny', 'movies', 'truth', 'course', 'story', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'lot', 'better', 'would', 'think', 'initially.THE', 'STORY', 'Chester', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'American', 'Pie', 'series', 'Road', 'Trip', 'Jessie', 'Ashton', 'Keaton', 'are', 'two', 'stoner', 'buds', 'who', 'wake', 'up', 'night', 'partying', 'NO', 'MEMORY', 'what', 'did', 'over', 'night', 'movie', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'had', 'quite', 'night', 'becoming', 'mixed', 'up', 'transvestite', 'striper', 'purchasing', 'types', 'stuff', 'even', 'becoming', 'caught', 'up', 'middle', 'intergalactic', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'midst', 'must', 'also', 'battle', 'save', 'relationships', 'twin', 'girlfriends', 'course', 'find', 'Jessie', 'missing', 'car.Best', 'Scenes', 'blind', 'boy', 'meeting', 'alien', 'chick-', 'Ostrich', 'farm-', 'Chinese', 'take-out-', 'ZOLTAN', 'DVD', 'FEATURES', 'DVD', 'actually', 'chalked', 'full', 'great', 'extras', 'including', 'Feature', 'Length', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'commentary', 'average/above', 'average', 'most', 'feature', 'length', 'commentary', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'listen', 'three', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny.-', '5', 'Minute', 'Featurette', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'Christie', 'Boner', 'Not', 'bad', '5', 'minutes', 'show', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'talk', 'movie', 'plot', 'basically', 'quick', 'commercial', 'aired', 'E', 'something.-', 'Movie', 'Trailer', 'TV', 'Commercial', 'Spots', 'usual', 'Nice', 'extra.-', '7', 'Extended', 'Scenes', 'Going', 'little', 'deleted', 'scene', 'actually', 'show', 'full', 'scenes', 'was', 'originally', 'filmed', 'deleted', 'footage', 'still', 'Overall', 'deleted', 'footage', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'added', 'story', 'ultimately', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'huge', 'difference', 'being', 'left', 'out', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'worthy', 'bonus.THE', 'VERDICT', ""'re"", 'looking', 'dumb', 'funny', 'yet', 'slightly', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'ticket', 'Chalk', 'full', 'laughs', 'mindless', 'fun', 'pretty', 'decent', 'storyline', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'pleaser', 'just', 'anyone', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'pleasant', 'added', 'bonus', 'well', 'making', 'great', 'rental', 'OR', 'liked', 'movie', 'enough', 'are', 'so', 'inclined', 'decent', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection']","Dude, Where's My Car?"

""Showgirls"" and ""Battlefield:Earth"", both have those distinctions of being in the first two spots. Both films being released by MGM and Warner Bros. respectively, and Fox releasing this. ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is just another studio's desperate bid to cash in on the grossout-teen comedy genre. Apparently these people have never heard of the word: overkill. Considering they're the ones behind such a lethal term. The film follows the adventures of two inept stoners named Chester and Jesse, Resident Dumbasses who end up losing their car, and must go in search of it. Along their journey, they encounter a nerdy alien cult, a group of sexy alien females, a braun but brainless jock, and Andy Dick among their many other adventures. Now , you expect a film like this to go along the tradition of ""Road Trip"" and ""American Pie"", a good natured teen raunch flick meant to make you laugh. But the antics of this film are seriously desperate, and seriously stupid. Stupid is a word to be debated with teen raunch flicks, but the unbelievable plot twists this film takes, just show you how much 20th Century Fox could give about a script. The film is just unbelievably bad, not even laughably bad. It goes into points of downright bad filmmaking. If you want to see a film like American Pie, just rent Road Trip, another Seann William Scott flick. Dude, Where's My Car? is just another travesty of bad filmmaking, that shows how Hollywood loves to produce in search of making the almighty buck.

Maybe its because I was interested in seeing Seann William Scott play another Stifler-type character, or a curiosity factor about Ashton Kutcher, who I still can't believe snagged the babe of Hollywood babes, Demi Moore. Man, if a stoner goofball like him could snag someone of Demi Moore stature, there should be hope for all guys out there! But really, the biggest reason I wanted to see this film was the scene I heard a few people talk about...the scene I found the funniest in the entire film and the reason why I give it two stars instead of the (n)one it deserves: the ostrich farm scene. I got a kick out of Ashton calling the ostriches ""llamas"" all the time...as my sister loves ostriches, llamas, and emus. The scene is a riot. Too bad there wasn't more of that in there.This film tries to be too many things, yet it was completely missold and very deceptive in its advertising.

535437,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00003CXS7,Robert J. Schneider,"[8, 13]","Okay, I promised myself that I wouldn't expend too much energy in writing this review after having seen this film (for free, thankfully) on Showtime, but I probably will anyway, so here goes: DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is one of the least funny so-called 'comedies' that I have seen in the past few years.  It's not just that it's a stupid movie (after all, what else would one expect from a film titled DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?), it's that it's just not funny. A famous reviewer once said that although there are bad horror films and bad dramas, there is no kind of film that is worse than a bad comedy.  I have to agree with this philosophy--and DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is a very painful example of it.Since humor is basically a subjective concept in the first place, let me illustrate my reaction to this movie with a comparison: I laughed throughout every single scene of BLAZING SADDLES, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, AIRPLANE!, THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD!, and SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER &amp; UNCUT. I laughed most of the time during AMERICAN PIE and SCARY MOVIE. I laughed occasionally while watching SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS and ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE. I chuckled sporadically at THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and DUMB AND DUMBER. I think I kind of snickered once or twice during one scene of DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? You get the idea.Anybody wanting to see this movie because of how funny Ashton Kutcher is as the terminally clueless stoner Michael Kelso in the very-funny TV hit &quot;That '70's Show&quot;, please stop yourself right now.  Although Kutcher does play a fairly similar character in this movie, if you expect the dialogue to be as smart and funny as on his TV show, you're going to be very disappointed.  This is a flick that assumes that people will find words like &quot;shibby&quot;, &quot;dude&quot; and &quot;sweet&quot; funny--especially when repeated over and over and *over* again.  Well I didn't, you sweet shibby dude. Oh, and I'm sorry but, no matter how many times the phrase &quot;continuum transfunctioner&quot; is spoken--at least 50 times in this movie, believe it or not--it just doesn't get funny, either. Oh well...DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is probably not the unfunniest comedy I've ever seen (that distinction would go out equally to the mega-bombs HEART CONDITION and THE CABLE GUY), but it's pretty well up there in the Top Ten!P.S.: the word &quot;shibby&quot; never caught on as the new 'cool word' the way the director and screenwriter had obviously thought that it would.

It's a shame because it sounds like it's the best night these two morons have ever had. The biggest problem they have the next morning is that they can't find whatshisface's car. They need to find it because it's got the anniversary presents they bought for their girlfriends in it. So they run all over town looking for the car and finding out about all the weird and amazing things they did the night before.My Opinion: I was going to give this movie one star, but it's got Marla Sokoloff in it and she's worth a star all by herself. This movie is supposed to be stupid they are all saying, but is it supposed to be so bad? I really didn't laugh. I didn't find the drug use funny. I don't think that age has anything to do with whether or not you find this funny. I think intelligence does. Maybe being high would help, but I wouldn't know. It's  a lot like an episode of a really bad WB network sitcom except it goes on for almost 90 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I really like funny/stupid movies and that's why I rented this one. DWMC just doesn't have any redeeming qualities. The drug use and sex content make it unsuitable for kids under 13, but the intelligence level is exactly suited for them.DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic 1.85:1 DD 5.1.

Movies like &quot;She's All That&quot; and &quot;Bring It On&quot; are not funny, and are successful because of the teeny bopper crowd who would see &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; if Freddy Prinze Jr. was in it. Among all this crap, is the two best teen comedies of this decade. &quot;Dude, Where's my Car&quot; and &quot;10 things I Hate About you&quot;. This movie is the pot comedy without the pot. It is a little &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Who Am I&quot; and a lot of &quot;Half Baked&quot;. It tells the story of two &quot;shibby&quot;-loving dorks, Jesse(Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (The funny-as-hell Seann William Scott), trying to find out the location of their car, where they put the gifts they bought their girlfriends, and why the hell they have a lifetime supply of pudding in the fridge. Along the way, the meet an ostrich-loving frenchie (Brent Spiner), alien worshipers(led by &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;s Hal Sparks), and a mercedes owning playboy (Fabio). This movie does the job of spoofing bullies and snobby girlfriends in Teens (&quot;You guys are sucky boyfriends!), creating a catchy phrase (Shibby!), and casting the most believable best friends since Bill and Ted. I know, this is from someone who would prefer Mallrats from Gladiator any day, but I love this movie with all my heart.
