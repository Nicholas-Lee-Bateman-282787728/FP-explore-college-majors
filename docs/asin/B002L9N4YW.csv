1275987,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002L9N4YW,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[23, 24]","The comedian known as the ""Fluffy Man"".  Gabriel Iglesias is one of the hottest comedians out there.  Latino flair and hilarious delivery, from his voice impressions to jokes about his weight or personal issues, he knows how to get the audience laughing from beginning to end.  There is no slow down in deliver, Iglesias is just hilarious!Iglesias is known from being the finalist of the fourth season of ""Last Comic Standing"" in 2006 but in 2007, it was the success of his 2nd special Comedy Central 2007 DVD  ""Hot & Fluffy"" (which sold over 300,000 copies) which would propel Gabriel Iglesias as a comedian that can sell out live performances and also comedy DVD's.Earlier in the year, Iglesias released a double album CD titled ""We Luf Fluffy"" from performances from 2006 & 2008 and now he returns with a new DVD titles ""I'm not Fat...I'm Fluffy"" which was recorded in El Paso.The tracklist on this DVD are as follows:1. Return to El Paso2. Nickelodeon3. Oh Hello No!!4. I Hear the Bell5. New Daddy6. I Do Voices Everywhere7. Obama8. My Girl9. Cop Story 110. USO11. Copy Story 212. Cakes and More Cakes13. Dropping Frankie Off14. DDR15. Disney16. Car Was StolenOn his latest DVD, ""I'm Not Fat...I'm Fluffy"", Iglesias is literally on top of his game delivery joke after joke.  From sharing stories of his return to El Paso and talking about a time he got drunk and ended up at an alternative gay bar to his first major gift from Nickelodeon to jokes about his personal life with his girlfriend and her son, Gabriel Iglesias's performance is just hilarious and magnificent.  This time around, because of the family experiences that he has to share, these are situations that people can relate to and again, the voices he does is just top notch as he is able to switch voices on command and just be surprised when you hear it.But you cold tell that his relationship with his girlfriend's son Frankie has brought new life to his routine and the fact that he can take those personal experiences and make them funny is just what makes the ""Fluffy Man"" so wonderful to watch on stage and he doesn't have to get nasty or profane to make the audience laugh.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Gabriel Iglesias - I'm Not Fat...I'm Fluffy: Live From El Paso"" is presented in widescreen. There are several angles closeup, stagewise, behind the audience and from a stage angle to showcase the audience at the front.  But overall, editing is well-done and stage setup is simple with pretty cool looking for the backdrop at the Plaza Theatre in El Paso, Texas.  Simple and clean. Lighting is well-done and for the most part, editing is good, no quick cuts to make the viewer dizzy.  Overall, a job well-done.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital and audio is clear and understandable.  Audience can be heard quite well.  Personally, I had my receiver set on stereo on all channels to have a more immersive soundstage in the room.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Gabriel Iglesias - I'm Not Fat...I'm Fluffy: Live From El Paso"" comes with the following special features:* Deleted Scene: High School Reunion - (7:45) A deleted scene in which Gabriel had to stop his routine because parts of the towel (lint) was all over his face and thus it hurt the pacing.  But Gabriel manages to take the situation and make it humorous for the audience.* Fluffy's Friends Hit the Stage: Martin Moreno - (4:59) Martin jokes about getting older and also today's young Latino guys who are wearing tight pants, tight shirts, plucking their eyebrows and how they are looking effeminate.* Fluffy's Friends Hit the Stage: Noe Gonzalez - (4:09) Noe's comedy is more adult-oriented.  Noel jokes about his size and the concept of size.* Onstage Q&A; With the Fans - (8:07) Gabriel Iglesias answers questions from his fans.JUDGMENT CALL:Gabriel Iglesias is definitely one of the most entertaining comedians today.  Where Latino comedians such as George Lopez and Paul Rodriguez represented the 80's and 90's, Gabriel Iglesias is a comedian that entertains people of all ages.  From jokes about video games and his family to jokes about sweating on stage and how it starts to smell like chicharones.  He just makes you laugh and laugh some more and this is what I found most interesting, this is probably one of the few Comedy Central DVD's, if not the first where the comedy routine is quite clean.  Granted, he may be saying things in Spanish but in English... it's a clean routine.If anything, this is a comedian who cares about his fans and he tells everyone straight up, if you see him at a restaurant, say hi.  How he is onstage and in real life are the same person and the fact that he gives that Q&A; after his performance in order to get the fans a chance to know more about him, goes to show how Iglesias is such a class act.  Positive personality but knows how to make the audience laugh...he's a talented comedian.Also, I have to say that ""I'm Not Fat...I'm Fluffy: Live from El Paso"" was a performance where he manages to keep the same excitement going from beginning to end.  His delivery is smooth, continuous and for the most part, just fantastic.There's nothing negative about this Comedy Central DVD at all.  If you thought ""Hot & Fluffy"" was a phenomenal DVD, then you have to give ""I'm Not Fat...I'm Fluffy: Live from El Paso"" a try because this is a fantastic comedy DVD.Highly recommended!",5,One of

Iglesias' humor is clever and contemporary dealing with everyday life situations as well as with his Hispanic heritage and most of all his weight. Then there is his vocal impersonations that are something to be heard. His impersonation of the OnStar woman's voice is so spot on you start to wonder if he really is the voice of OnStar. Most of all about Gabriel that strikes me is his personality. He really enjoys performing in front of the audience and seems so down to earth. During his routine on this DVD he mentions that if people should see him out in public to not hesitate to come over and say hi and he really means it. He loves meeting people and the love he has for his fans is genuine. And the love that Gabriel gets back from his fans is at least equal to if not greater then what he gives. Thank you Gabriel Iglesias for restoring my faith in there being comedians out there who can be clever and insightful with their humor without resorting to vulgar potty mouth language! If you are a fan of Gabriel that you got to get the DVD of him in performance. If you have never heard of Gabriel then treat yourself to some of the funniest humor you will ever hear. I promise you will be laughing from start to finish at this DVD.,5,The Way Comedy Should Be,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,1579,"['world', 'comedy', 'today', 'where', 'comedians', 'think', 'humor', 'stringing', 'bunch', 'f-bombs', 'other', 'obscene', 'words', 'together', 'could', 'make', 'sailor', 'blush', 'Gabriel', 'Iglesias', 'proverbial', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Finally', 'comedian', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'listen', 'fear', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'hear', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'Iglesias', 'humor', 'clever', 'contemporary', 'dealing', 'everyday', 'life', 'situations', 'as', 'well', 'Hispanic', 'heritage', 'most', 'weight', 'Then', 'vocal', 'impersonations', 'are', 'something', 'be', 'heard', 'impersonation', 'OnStar', 'woman', 'voice', 'so', 'spot', 'start', 'wonder', 'really', 'voice', 'OnStar', 'Most', 'Gabriel', 'personality', 'really', 'performing', 'front', 'audience', 'so', 'down', 'earth', 'routine', 'DVD', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'out', 'public', 'not', 'hesitate', 'come', 'say', 'hi', 'really', 'meeting', 'people', 'love', 'fans', 'genuine', 'love', 'Gabriel', 'back', 'fans', 'least', 'equal', 'not', 'greater', 'then', 'what', 'Thank', 'Gabriel', 'Iglesias', 'restoring', 'faith', 'being', 'comedians', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'clever', 'insightful', 'humor', 'resorting', 'vulgar', 'potty', 'mouth', 'language', 'are', 'fan', 'Gabriel', 'got', 'get', 'DVD', 'performance', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Gabriel', 'then', 'treat', 'funniest', 'humor', 'will', 'ever', 'hear', 'promise', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'start', 'finish', 'DVD']",N/A

Gabriel Iglesias, aka ""Fluffy,"" is so refreshing and a total riot. i love his ""tex-mex"" type humor. Gabriel is very funny without being totally vulgar like a lot of the garbage that is out there. i love the anecdotes about his friends and his everyday run-ins with the law. he also touches on good, positive family values. you can tell from his stories that he loves everyone around him and they love him very much in return. after listening to him perform, it makes you want to hang out with him and his friends--even if Felipe and his mouth are in the car with you. the fact that they are all a lively, good spirited bunch shines through and makes his fans yearn for more stories and good beats. if you purchase this cd you'll see that no one tells a story like fluffy. Gabriel is honest, sincere and responsible. his good-heartedness makes every average good person relate to him. as a testament to his goodness and fan loyalty, fluffy shares with the audience that a particular fan of his goes to see fluffy's every show. in fact, this particular fan has seen him approximately 250 times and counting. although we may not be physically with Gabriel Iglesias every time he performs, you will find yourself watching him endlessly on this dvd. i urge you to show your dedication and faithfullness by buying this dvd. i promise that you won't regret this purchase one bit.
