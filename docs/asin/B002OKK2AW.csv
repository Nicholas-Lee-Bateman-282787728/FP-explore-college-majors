1281080,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,B002OKK2AW,,"[0, 0]","If you watch the Special Features, you will hear either the director or one of the writers, perhaps both state that the inspiration behind Star Wreck was to produce a really good giant space battle and make it more like a real movie and less like all the other fan boi stiff already out there. In these two goals the Finnish crew and cast achieved a very reasonable effort. Consider that Star Trek, Babylon 5 , Star Wars and most of the rest of the genre of serious space movies are in major need for satire and Star Wreck does fill a niche.The jokes either do not translate well or are not that good. The names for the main space weapons are my favorite joke, and I will not give them here least I spoil one of the few things that could be spoiled. Character names tend to be a bit obvious: Pirk for Kirk, Dwarf for Warf and so on. Of course the captain, here an emperor is an overweening egotistical coward and why his crew or armada has any loyalty to him is a mystery rather than part of the joke.  The is a Russian Star Ship Captain, no not Chekov but Fukov  ( the same actor will also play a briefly seen character: Festerbester, a name I only know from Mad Magazine). Fukov is something of a cast clown, but too over the top and predictable.The plot involves a play on the time travel in the original Star Trek televise episode. Only on this version the stranded crew members from the future cannot do much of anything right to live reasonable lives (in this version they are in Finland which tends to explain why everyone speaks Finnish). So they take their future knowledge of technology to Russia and from there take over the Earth. The people of Unified Earth seems to be more interested in their continued poverty and need to eat regular so Capt Pirk, Emperor builds a huge Armada. With his 40 Space ships the mission is to find a new habitable planet. Expendable crew members are used to test planets for suitability. Red shirts never catch a break. Instead they find a slug hole (worm hole) and on the far side they will find their giant space battle.The special effects are pretty goods. Certainly up to the standards of the original television show and better than some for the time of the movie's release 2005. Costuming is fair to better than some and while the actors are not Hollywood quality they have some moments.Star Wreck is not a bad movie. I rather liked the FX, had little use for the jokes but think these guys did a pretty decent job. The various Space movies need a good satire. Space Balls for all its named cast and Mel Brooks magic is hardly any better. Galaxy Quest may be alone as the one satire to best get the laughs out of outer space.My recommendation: worth a view. It is mostly family friendly. There is enough `insider' stuff to get the occasional smile. Star Wreck has some collector value, but not much entertainment value.",3,"I really wanted to like this movie, and I cannot bring myself to hate it",1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,2868,"['watch', 'Special', 'Features', 'will', 'hear', 'director', 'one', 'writers', 'perhaps', 'state', 'inspiration', 'Star', 'Wreck', 'was', 'produce', 'really', 'good', 'giant', 'space', 'battle', 'make', 'more', 'real', 'movie', 'less', 'other', 'fan', 'boi', 'stiff', 'already', 'there', 'two', 'goals', 'Finnish', 'crew', 'cast', 'achieved', 'very', 'reasonable', 'effort', 'Consider', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Babylon', '5', 'Star', 'Wars', 'most', 'rest', 'genre', 'serious', 'space', 'movies', 'are', 'major', 'need', 'satire', 'Star', 'Wreck', 'fill', 'niche.The', 'jokes', 'either', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'names', 'main', 'space', 'weapons', 'are', 'favorite', 'joke', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'here', 'least', 'spoil', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'spoiled', 'Character', 'names', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'obvious', 'Pirk', 'Kirk', 'Dwarf', 'Warf', 'so', 'course', 'captain', 'here', 'emperor', 'overweening', 'egotistical', 'coward', 'why', 'crew', 'armada', 'loyalty', 'mystery', 'rather', 'part', 'joke', 'Russian', 'Star', 'Ship', 'Captain', 'not', 'Chekov', 'Fukov', 'same', 'actor', 'will', 'also', 'play', 'briefly', 'seen', 'character', 'Festerbester', 'name', 'only', 'know', 'Mad', 'Magazine', 'Fukov', 'something', 'cast', 'clown', 'too', 'top', 'predictable.The', 'plot', 'play', 'time', 'travel', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'televise', 'episode', 'Only', 'version', 'stranded', 'crew', 'members', 'future', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'right', 'live', 'reasonable', 'lives', 'version', 'are', 'Finland', 'explain', 'why', 'everyone', 'Finnish', 'take', 'future', 'knowledge', 'technology', 'Russia', 'there', 'take', 'over', 'Earth', 'people', 'Unified', 'Earth', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'continued', 'poverty', 'need', 'eat', 'regular', 'so', 'Capt', 'Pirk', 'Emperor', 'huge', 'Armada', '40', 'Space', 'ships', 'mission', 'find', 'new', 'habitable', 'planet', 'Expendable', 'crew', 'members', 'are', 'used', 'test', 'planets', 'suitability', 'Red', 'shirts', 'never', 'catch', 'break', 'Instead', 'find', 'slug', 'hole', 'worm', 'hole', 'far', 'side', 'will', 'find', 'giant', 'space', 'battle.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'goods', 'Certainly', 'standards', 'original', 'television', 'show', 'better', 'time', 'movie', 'release', '2005', 'Costuming', 'fair', 'better', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'quality', 'have', 'moments.Star', 'Wreck', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'rather', 'liked', 'FX', 'had', 'little', 'use', 'jokes', 'think', 'guys', 'did', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'various', 'Space', 'movies', 'need', 'good', 'satire', 'Space', 'Balls', 'named', 'cast', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'magic', 'hardly', 'better', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'may', 'be', 'alone', 'one', 'satire', 'best', 'get', 'laughs', 'outer', 'space.My', 'recommendation', 'worth', 'view', 'mostly', 'family', 'friendly', 'enough', 'insider', 'stuff', 'get', 'occasional', 'smile', 'Star', 'Wreck', 'collector', 'value', 'not', 'much', 'entertainment', 'value']",Star Wreck

I don't want to ruin the movie with spoilers, but I would have changed some things, especially in the beginning.

Visit their website for a summary of them: starwreck.com/legacy/movies.phpThe creators actually state ""You can also download all the movies [through a torrent client],"" so don't feel guilty about doing so, since this currently appears to be the only way to attain them (""The Star Wreck Store is closed for renovations""). The first one (1992) is very rudimentary animation, but they gradually improve, culminating in the feature film on this DVD.The humor is sophomoric, but given that the ""actors"" are probably sophomores (college? high school? hard to tell) with no formal dramatic education (another guess on my part), perhaps we can cut them some slack. There are occasional moments of hilarity, often from the smallest of details. Captain Pirk damaging one of the screens on the bridge in a fit of temper should at least elicit a grin.As other reviewers have mentioned, the CGI battles are impressive. Chroma keying is also used in the film, which lends credibility to the production.

1281091,A3CU2CENB2Q7U2,B002OKK2AW,"Joseph J. Reinemann ""jjreinem""","[45, 46]","There have been a LOT of Star Trek films produced by fans over the years.  Some have been amazing, some have been platforms for self-insertion fan fiction, and some have just been embarrasingly derivative.  A few of them have even been parodies, though sadly the production quality has rarely been worth commenting about.  What makes this film stand out is the fact that it does something very different than all the others: it doesn't try to be Star Trek, and is brilliant because of it.Someone who has never seen Star Trek could sit down, watch this movie, and still come away laughing.  One of the reasons for this is that, at its core, it's really not making fun of Star Trek at all.  Most of the jokes that are directly connected to the series actually stem from the various questionable translation choices that were made in adapting the shows and movies to the Finnish language.  The main character, James B. Pirk, isn't so much a parody of Captain Kirk as he is a thoroughly flawed character who one could imagine would look up to someone like Kirk as a role model and end up learning all the wrong lessons from him.  I think it helps that most of these characters were created years ago, and given enough time to develop their own individual personalities and identities which remain separate from what we see on the show.  As such their behavior and actions stand out as being genuinely funny on their own instead of relying on a previous knowledge of the source material being parodied to get the joke.  It also doesn't hurt that the filmmakers held every step of the production to an exceedingly high standard.  This film is filled with excellent performances and some of the best effects and production values you're likely to find in any fan film, let alone a parody (most of which don't even bother trying to look good on the assumption that this somehow adds to the ""charm."")  While there are times when its clear that the film is the work of a bunch of friends setting out to have some fun making a movie, the end results are nothing if not professional.  In fact I would say that many of the battle sequences are in fact better than some of the ones we've seen in the official movies.That said, there are a few things that a potential customer needs to keep in mind when purchasing this film.  For a start: it is a Finnish film, made for a Finnish audience, most of whom it can be assumed are fluent Finnish speakers.  Finnish isn't always a very pretty language (though I'll admit that as time went on it started to take on a near hypnotic quality.)  There is no English dubbing, though there are excellent subtitles.  The translation was done by one of the people who worked on the film, so the film avoids many of the usual translation errors.  All the jokes relying on a play on words and other forms of linguistic humor (such as Pirk's obvious difficulty pronouncing and/or understanding the definitions of some of the words he uses) are faithfully translated into English.  That said, not all of them are immediately recognizable as jokes.  It takes a bit of research for instance to learn the humor behind the weapons being called ""twinklers"" and ""light balls,"" stemming from a case of less-than-inspired Finnish translation of Star Trek.  For me this really wasn't a problem.  In fact I rather enjoyed reading up a little on the background of Finnish Science Fiction and later going back to watch the film again so I could catch this second layer of humor that had been injected throughout the script.  But if you're one of those people who simply can't abide subtitles in film, you might want to give this a pass and wait for their next film, Iron Sky.The second thing to keep in mind, particularly if you're a fervent fan of Star Trek, is that you need to be able to take a joke about the franchise.  I'll admit to being a devoted Trekkie (or Trekker, as that seems to be the more popular term these days) and I thought it was hilarious.  But then again I have met a few people who view any kind of jab at Spock's pseudo-scientific explanations or Kirk and Riker's habitual womanizing as a form of minor herecy.  Much of the humor stems from the fact that the way Pirk's mind works is not at all in what many would refer to as the spirit of Star Trek.  I hope that for most this won't be a reason not to pick this DVD up, but I do realize that for some of you that may be a deal breaker.Finally, I have to say that if any of these opinions have made you unsure about picking up the DVD, I'd suggest that you go to the internet and pick up a copy of the original cut of the film.  It's free (the producers have links on their site) and comes in several flavors of subtitling.  Unlike the Imperial Edition DVD, it also features effects shots using the original Star Trek ship designs.  If after watching that you decide that perhaps you can live with the subtitles and the awesome force of raw ego that is James B. Pirk, I'd say pick up a copy of the DVD so you can get the special features, new (litigation-proof) effects, and give the film makers an incentive to bring us more films of this caliber in the future.  If you're like me and appreciate a strong witty script which isn't afraid to stop taking itself seriously every now and then coupled with professional level special effects, there's really no way you can go wrong with this film.",5,"An amazing film, with a few things to keep in mind.",1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,5371,"['have', 'been', 'LOT', 'Star', 'Trek', 'films', 'produced', 'fans', 'years',

1281100,A2C5VCR3DYDPR2,B002OKK2AW,Some Guy,"[4, 4]","Wow, was I surprised when I finally saw this.  As you probably already know, it's a Star Trek/Babylon 5 parody, with it's own unrelated storyline.What really impresses me are the special effects.  Given this was done with a sub-Hollywood budget, the special effects are 10 times better than anything you'll see in the crap Sci-Fi Channel keeps cranking out.Once they leave Earth, the movie becomes basically one long space battle.  Of course there's more mixed in, but this has to be the most spaceship battle-packed film ever made.  I'm a major junkie for spaceship battles, and was totally sated!  They had a little fun with the differing technology of ST and B5, too.  There are a few ""oops"" moments that are good for a genuine chuckle, and lead to some great moments during the battles.The comedy is a little hit or miss, but there are genuine laughs.  The translators (subtitles only, I'm afraid,) seemed to make sure the puns came through properly.  For example, the B5 Mimbari are called Minibar.  There are countless name plays like this and they all work.  Kudos to the translators.It's all done lightheartedly, yet the space action sequences leave nothing wanting.  Unless you're a complete anal retentive, you won't notice or care about the lack of that last itty bitty detail of model shading that a $200K budget buys.  This just looks really good.As many have said, the bad acting is a let-down, and the early plot is rather a stretch.  But you have to keep in mind that this is a comedy about something that's total escapism in the first place, so I don't mind that it's not Citizen Kane.If you think you'd enjoy a funny ST/B5 parody, or just a funny Sci-Fi movie, definitely get this!",4,"Big battles, big fun",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,1699,"['Wow', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'finally', 'saw', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'Star', 'Trek/Babylon', '5', 'parody', 'own', 'unrelated', 'storyline.What', 'really', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'Given', 'was', 'done', 'sub-Hollywood', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'are', '10', 'times', 'better', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'see', 'crap', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'cranking', 'out.Once', 'leave', 'Earth', 'movie', 'basically', 'one', 'long', 'space', 'battle', 'course', 'more', 'mixed', 'be', 'most', 'spaceship', 'battle-packed', 'film', 'ever', 'made', ""'m"", 'major', 'junkie', 'spaceship', 'battles', 'was', 'totally', 'sated', 'had', 'little', 'fun', 'differing', 'technology', 'ST', 'B5', 'too', 'are', 'few', 'oops', 'moments', 'are', 'good', 'genuine', 'chuckle', 'lead', 'great', 'moments', 'battles.The', 'comedy', 'little', 'hit', 'miss', 'are', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'translators', 'subtitles', 'only', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'seemed', 'make', 'sure', 'puns', 'came', 'properly', 'example', 'B5', 'Mimbari', 'are', 'called', 'Minibar', 'are', 'countless', 'name', 'work', 'Kudos', 'translators.It', 'done', 'lightheartedly', 'yet', 'space', 'action', 'sequences', 'leave', 'nothing', 'wanting', ""'re"", 'complete', 'anal', 'retentive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'care', 'lack', 'last', 'itty', 'bitty', 'detail', 'model', 'shading', '200K', 'budget', 'buys', 'just', 'really', 'good.As', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'bad', 'acting', 'let-down', 'early', 'plot', 'rather', 'stretch', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'comedy', 'something', 'total', 'escapism', 'first', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane.If', 'think', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'funny', 'ST/B5', 'parody', 'just', 'funny', 'Sci-Fi', 'movie', 'definitely', 'get']",Star Wreck
