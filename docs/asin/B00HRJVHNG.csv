I think I stuck it out 25 minutes and then I was irritated and quickly stopped it and went to another movie that was much, much better (it would not have taken much to be better!).

Eric Roberts and Danielle Harris are good, but they are not in the film all that much. There is a fair amount of gore towards the end, but that is hardly worth the investment of time and money.

1691761,A2N1EQWZ1Z4IMM,B00HRJVHNG,"E. K. B. ""eblunt777""","[2, 3]","Emily over at BluntReview(dot)com says: Eric Roberts, who does a larger cameo here, had me at, ""They took my finger Charlie,"" in Pope of Greenwich Village. He is a mega-talent that can't seem to catch the ""star maker"" role, even after all these years... Anyway, here he lets his werewolf-wide pearlys chomp into a really smart script.That being said, Camp Dread suffers in its on and off again composition techniques, its direction, of a story whose big reveal takes a big viewing commitment to get there. And either you'll be excited at the neat twist, or you've turned off the film as the wait's too gosh darn long. What I'm saying is that sometimes the movie and its desire to thrill (albeit summer-slasher-of-olden-days' movie style) is clear and other times your RCA-dogging at the TV, trying to follow and stay engaged. But, director Harrison Smith (who wrote The Fields) has a dynamic future ahead of him; Camp Dread is perhaps his Dementia 13. There are little planted saplings of rare orchid among some swamp weeds.Story goes...a bunch of ne'er do well people are auditioning for a new reality show. They will get a free trip to an old-school-style camp for the camera's enjoyment of viscerally intruding into every aspect of their day.But, once the chosen cast, filled with stereotypes of really rude self-centered people, arrives it's the proverbial Ten Little Indians as members start to disappear. It must be part of the show they all think ...The rather clog-stepped start has a fun pay off. Since, most of the film's audience should be heading down one plot path only to find themselves chutes and laddered down another; that is very clever. But, perhaps as Camp Dread had (obviously) a lower budget, and perhaps this is why some edits, or vital story scenes are a tad confusing (or is it the curse of the writer/director ?). And I'm leaving the actors alone because performances range so much; Roberts is clearly the ""star"", though he only shows towards the end.Yet, over all the plot is so wonderfully Night Gallery (&lt;- giving its viewing age group a nod here folks) you'll want to chomp that popcorn through to its end. Well, that being said, if it's a raining night and you're in for the night, and up for semi-old fashioned horror that takes its time revealing itself. Bottom line is, Camp Dread is absolutely not for the tell-me-all- Twitter- news-in-two-sentences-set.This is recommended for film makers and film aficionados to take note on bringing a great plot to screen, while taking notice where the film could have really been reigned in and taken it from so-so to amazing; Camp Dread is a coulda been. And, for those wanting to create themselves, alesson in keeping it tight, and remember your audience is waiting...Snack recommendation: A gigantic pot of popcorn with full-fat butter; and for filmmakers, a note pad ;)",3,Clever Script Worth a Watch,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,2850,"['Emily', 'BluntReview', 'dot', 'com', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'who', 'larger', 'cameo', 'here', 'had', 'took', 'finger', 'Charlie', 'Pope', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'mega-talent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'star', 'maker', 'role', 'even', 'years', 'Anyway', 'here', 'werewolf-wide', 'pearlys', 'chomp', 'really', 'smart', 'script.That', 'being', 'said', 'Camp', 'Dread', 'suffers', 'off', 'again', 'composition', 'techniques', 'direction', 'story', 'big', 'reveal', 'big', 'viewing', 'commitment', 'get', 'there', ""'ll"", 'be', 'excited', 'neat', 'twist', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'wait', 'too', 'gosh', 'darn', 'long', 'What', ""'m"", 'saying', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'desire', 'thrill', 'summer-slasher-of-olden-days', 'movie', 'style', 'clear', 'other', 'times', 'RCA-dogging', 'TV', 'trying', 'follow', 'stay', 'engaged', 'director', 'Harrison', 'Smith', 'who', 'wrote', 'Fields', 'dynamic', 'future', 'ahead', 'Camp', 'Dread', 'perhaps', 'Dementia', '13', 'are', 'little', 'planted', 'saplings', 'rare', 'orchid', 'swamp', 'weeds.Story', 'bunch', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'people', 'are', 'auditioning', 'new', 'reality', 'show', 'will', 'get', 'free', 'trip', 'old-school-style', 'camp', 'camera', 'enjoyment', 'viscerally', 'intruding', 'aspect', 'day.But', 'once', 'chosen', 'cast', 'filled', 'stereotypes', 'really', 'rude', 'self-centered', 'people', 'proverbial', 'Ten', 'Little', 'Indians', 'members', 'start', 'disappear', 'must', 'be', 'part', 'show', 'think', 'rather', 'clog-stepped', 'start', 'fun', 'pay', 'off', 'most', 'film', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'heading', 'one', 'plot', 'path', 'only', 'find', 'chutes', 'laddered', 'down', 'very', 'clever', 'perhaps', 'Camp', 'Dread', 'had', 'obviously', 'lower', 'budget', 'perhaps', 'why', 'edits', 'vital', 'story', 'scenes', 'are', 'tad', 'confusing', 'curse', 'writer/director', ""'m"", 'leaving', 'actors', 'alone', 'performances', 'range', 'so', 'much', 'Roberts', 'clearly', 'star', 'only', 'end.Yet', 'plot', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'lt', 'giving', 'viewing', 'age', 'group', 'nod', 'here', 'folks', ""'ll"", 'want', 'chomp', 'popcorn', 'end', 'Well', 'being', 'said', 'raining', 'night', ""'re"", 'night', 'up', 'semi-old', 'fashioned', 'horror', 'time', 'revealing', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Camp', 'Dread', 'absolutely', 'not', 'tell-me-all-', 'Twitter-', 'news-in-two-sentences-set.This', 'recommended', 'film', 'makers', 'film', 'aficionados', 'take', 'note', 'bringing', 'great', 'plot', 'screen', 'taking', 'notice', 'where', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'reigned', 'taken', 'so-so', 'amazing', 'Camp', 'Dread', 'coulda', 'been', 'wanting', 'create', 'alesson', 'keeping', 'tight', 'remember', 'audience', 'waiting', 'Snack', 'recommendation', 'gigantic', 'pot', 'popcorn', 'full-fat', 'butter', 'filmmakers', 'note', 'pad']",Camp Dread

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[4, 7]","DREAD-fulImagine - if you will - that you and your fellow yucksters from the Class of '85 got together at a reunion to talk about the good ol' days.  Imagine that one of the things you collectively missed most were those quality, simple slasher flicks of your youth, any number of low budget knock-offs of the FRIDAY THE 13TH variety.  What's wrong with kids today, you and your aging friends insist, is that they're way too fascinated with reality television.  So you figure, ""Hey, we pool our money, and we could come up with a script that both pays homage to the stuff we were watching back then as well as draw in today's kids by dishing it out in the form of a reality farce, right?""(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Director Julian Barrett (the equally reliable and slimy Eric Roberts) made his fortune directing a handful of ""Summer Camp"" slasher films in the 80's.  Now that nostalgia is all the craze, he decides that he can reboot his franchise and open the door to untold millions.  But how can he truly bring it back with modern gusto?  Why, he'll enlist a few of his former stars, hire a group of young good-looking contestants, and stage a ""Summer Camp"" re-enactment.  Only this time, someone's taking the plot far too seriously as, one-by-one, kids start turning up dead!Ugh.  CAMP DREAD is, by and large, pretty dreadful.There's a solid idea wrapped up in it - a modern day twist on reality programming - but it all gets wasted in such an overwhelming lackluster package.  For starters, Eric Roberts - the presumed ""star"" here - really isn't in all that much of the movie; essentially, his role serves to book-end the picture, appearing early to set it all up and then re-emerging in the finale to `solve' the case.  While he does have several scenes in between, they mostly serve as filler - Eric chuckles about this, Eric raises his eyebrows about that, Eric flashes his most thoughtful glance, etc. - so they're easily written off as fodder.To make matters worse, this CAMP is rounded out by what might be the largest collection of untalented posers since, well, anything else Roberts has done since he assumed direct-to-DVD knighthood.The teenagers are supposed to be a bunch of hard-luck cases undergoing a form of forced rehabilitation, but they're not given any significant depth; this puts them in the position are serving a pawns to a plot conceived by a small team of equally untalented screenwriters.  Here's my best tip to anyone seriously reading this: if the audience doesn't care about the characters, then their associated deaths are nothing more than exploitation.  Now, if that exploitation is good, handled well and gratuitous, then there may be some mild vicarious thrill in watching these ten little Indians meet their doom.  Since the splatter effects are nothing new as well as being so tightly shot that can't really be appreciated unless you want to pause, rewind, and try again (until you figure out what you're looking at), then even that strength becomes a weakness.This CAMP is a place best left closed for the summer and beyond.CAMP DREAD (2014) is produced by Class of 85 LLC.  DVD distribution is being handled (jointly) by RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, this somewhat `indie' feature offers up some reasonable quality sights and sounds; the chief problem I had with the entire film is that I found a surprising portion of the audio to be muddled.  In fact, a few sequences were downright difficult to hear.  As is often the case when these smaller flicks find eventual release, there are no (zero!) special features ... but I don't consider that a loss.(NOT REALLY) RECOMMENDED.  As often happens, CAMP DREAD has a solid idea (a horror/reality slasher hybrid); the problems within lie entirely on lackluster execution, lackluster performances, and lackluster (if not downright predictable) conclusion.  (Emphasis on the ""lackluster,"" people.)  You know that when even Eric Roberts is `phoning it in' that your movie is in deep, deep trouble.  In fact, I find it downright inconceivable that this script is the best that any single screenwriter could imagine; arguably, this feature feels like it was conceived by committee (maybe a drunk one, at that), and that makes it the worst examples of `groupthink' of recent record.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment

Don't be disappointed if you are signing on for Danielle. She's only in the beginning and the end. The summer camp slasher is updated by setting it as a 'reality tv show', which is sprung on the 'contestants' at the last minute. They thought they were going to an 'Outward Bound' type of camp because they were in some kind of trouble and it was either that or rehab/jail/parents disowning them, etc. They are informed that the 'last one standing' will win 1,000,000. The director, played by Eric Roberts, had a big success in the 80s with a slasher horror flick set at the same camp the present &#34;reality tv show&#34; is set.  He recruits his former star who is now a counselor/therapist to work as the counselor for the contestants. They are not teens, more like 21 and up but not past late 20s. He is planning on taking this taping and pitching it as a remake for his old horror hit. Time has not been kind to him so he's got an urgency for money. Anyway, the movie is pretty straightforward for this type of flick. There are tensions and conflicts between campers and nobody knows who the &#34;killer&#34; is (as far as they are concerned, its just an act) but then suddenly things take a turn for the too much reality. The killer's identity isn't known until the end. There's an novel little reveal toward the end about the funding for this 'show'. LOL This flick is like one of the many camper slasher flicks that came out in the 80s. Its mission is to give the horror junkie something to watch, not aiming for any awards. That's why I didn't round up and give it a 4. Better you keep your expectations in check. I wouldn't recommend it as the main event in a movie night shindig.

1691764,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00HRJVHNG,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[8, 10]","There's a fine line between respectfully imitating the slasher genre and failing at it. I can't quite tell you why it works at times and why the concept falls flat at others. The &#34;Scream&#34; movies did a great job of being self-aware, celebrating all the typical ingredients of a good killer flick, and then expanding upon it. &#34;Camp Dread&#34; is a movie that gets the overly-tried and true formula for fun, sophisticated gore, and thrills right for the most part.A group of troubled young adults are recruited to attend a summer camp at the location where a series of slasher films were made in the 1980s. Director Julian Barrett (Eric Roberts) invites them to take part in a reality TV-based reboot of his franchise where the last person left alive wins a million dollars. The attendees think it's all staged until corpses are found strewn out all over the campgrounds.&#34;Camp Dread&#34; tries very hard to rise above the countless other clones of &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; that are released weekly straight-to-DVD. Although not perfect, its genuine effort through the use of practical gore effects and an attempt at a fun surprise ending far outweigh its sometimes tedious checklist of genre do's and don't's. In a world firmly submerged in the use of CGI, it's a breath of fresh air to see the use of theatrical blood and prosthetics, even if they don't always look as &#34;real&#34; as they should.The cast of victims are your typical bunch of multi-cultural types from all walks of life. Each one is given traits that instill in the viewer a sense of urgency to see each of them die a horrible death. The actors play their roles quite well on a B-movie level. Eric Roberts is as smarmy and loathsome as ever in his role as the washed-up and desperate movie director. Danielle Harris gets far too little screen-time playing the token sheriff of the small town where the camp is located. It's entertaining to see the little scream queen from all the &#34;Halloween&#34; movies grown up and playing an adult in a position of power.&#34;Camp Dread&#34; is not rated, but could easily carry an R. There's bloody violence, language, adult situations, and nudity. It has everything long-time audiences of slasher films have come to expect&#8230; and in one scene a little more possibly.&#34;Camp Dread&#34; is a fun rollercoaster ride of thrills and gore that commemorates the slasher films that came before it. The movie mimics its predecessors on purpose while wanting to be taken seriously through throwing in some interesting plot twists and turns in its finale. Fans of &#34;The Burning,&#34; &#34;Friday the 13th,&#34; and other similar films will take pleasure in this bloody romp through the woods.",4,Can anyone survive a summer at 'Camp Dread?',1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,2716,"['fine', 'line', 'respectfully', 'imitating', 'slasher', 'genre', 'failing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'tell', 'why', 'times', 'why', 'concept', 'flat', 'others', '34', 'Scream', '34', 'movies', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'self-aware', 'celebrating', 'typical', 'ingredients', 'good', 'killer', 'flick', 'then', 'expanding', '34', 'Camp', 'Dread', '34', 'movie', 'overly-tried', 'true', 'formula', 'fun', 'sophisticated', 'gore', 'thrills', 'right', 'most', 'part.A', 'group', 'troubled', 'young', 'adults', 'are', 'recruited', 'attend', 'summer', 'camp', 'location', 'where', 'series', 'slasher', 'films', 'were', 'made', '1980s', 'Director', 'Julian', 'Barrett', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'take', 'part', 'reality', 'TV-based', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'where', 'last', 'person', 'left', 'alive', 'wins', 'million', 'dollars', 'attendees', 'think', 'staged', 'corpses', 'are', 'found', 'strewn', 'campgrounds.', '34', 'Camp', 'Dread', '34', 'tries', 'very', 'hard', 'rise', 'countless', 'other', 'clones', '34', 'Friday', '13th', '34', 'are', 'released', 'weekly', 'straight-to-DVD', 'not', 'perfect', 'genuine', 'effort', 'use', 'practical', 'gore', 'effects', 'attempt', 'fun', 'surprise', 'ending', 'far', 'outweigh', 'sometimes', 'tedious', 'checklist', 'genre', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'world', 'firmly', 'submerged', 'use', 'CGI', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'see', 'use', 'theatrical', 'blood', 'prosthetics', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'look', '34', 'real', '34', 'should.The', 'cast', 'victims', 'are', 'typical', 'bunch', 'multi-cultural', 'types', 'walks', 'life', 'one', 'given', 'traits', 'instill', 'viewer', 'sense', 'urgency', 'see', 'die', 'horrible', 'death', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'quite', 'well', 'B-movie', 'level', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'smarmy', 'loathsome', 'ever', 'role', 'washed-up', 'desperate', 'movie', 'director', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'screen-time', 'playing', 'token', 'sheriff', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'camp', 'located', 'entertaining', 'see', 'little', 'scream', 'queen', '34', 'Halloween', '34', 'movies', 'grown', 'up', 'playing', 'adult', 'position', 'power.', '34', 'Camp', 'Dread', '34', 'not', 'rated', 'could', 'easily', 'carry', 'R.', 'bloody', 'violence', 'language', 'adult', 'situations', 'nudity', 'everything', 'long-time', 'audiences', 'slasher', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'expect', '8230', 'one', 'scene', 'little', 'more', 'possibly.', '34', 'Camp', 'Dread', '34', 'fun', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'thrills', 'gore', 'slasher', 'films', 'came', 'movie', 'predecessors', 'purpose', 'wanting', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'throwing', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'finale', 'Fans', '34', 'Burning', '34', '34', 'Friday', '13th', '34', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'will', 'take', 'pleasure', 'bloody', 'woods']",Camp Dread
