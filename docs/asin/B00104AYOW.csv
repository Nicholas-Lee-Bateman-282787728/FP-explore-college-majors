1123983,A1IM4D3R61A2K0,B00104AYOW,DR. B,"[66, 67]","The first thing I noticed when we received these was you do get 5 disks but there are only 4 shows per disk.  So be prepared not to receive a lot of shows.  Price seems high for only 20 shows.  The quality of the video ranged from poor to good.  Some where obvisouly just a film of a TV monitor shot when the show was aired live, which was quite common in the 1950's.  Later shows were on film and were good quality.  Shows ranged from 1954 to 1960.The material is of course classic Jack Benny and still makes you laugh, particulary the Lucky Strike commericals which are included in some episodes (you can show your kids what TV was like in primitive times).There are no special features, not even chapter breaks.  I wish they would do for Jack Benny what they did for I Love Lucy, those disks are packed with features, chapters, restored, etc.  More than you ever expected.  Oh Well.",3,Not really a lot of shows for the price.
