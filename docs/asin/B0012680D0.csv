This documentary sheds new light on our obesity epidemic and how we got so big.Corn, it's fed to cattle and poultry to fatten it up, and us along with it.Blame Earl Butz, Nixon's secretary of agriculture.  This elderly gentleman in the movie remembers when he was a kid.  The government paid farmer's not to produce as much corn.People were less obese back then because food cost more, and now it's much cheaper,  and here we are with two out of three adults overweight.An acre of corn costs $350 to grow and brings in around $325 on the open market.Farmers make money off corn from government subsidies which allow them to make around $27 an acre.  So because of this, farms keep getting bigger and bigger, with each corn grower farming thousands of acres.  It only takes 18 minutes to plant 31,000 corn kernals using machinery.  Everything is automated.  Specially hybridized corn can produce a staggering two hundred bushels per acre, as opposed to only forty bushels per acre in the nineteen fifties.Documentarian Aaron Woolfe may be onto something here.  This is a real eye opener.There is some great photography of the midwest cornbelt here, and the mountains of corn being spewed out of huge machines onto piles on the ground.I took off one star because after watching so much corn from every possible aspect, it started to get a bit boring.  I never wanted to see or think about corn again, at least for a while, after watching this. However as a documentary it earns five stars for great photography, and thouroughness in covering the subject.This really gives me a lot to think about, diet wise.  It seems most of the corn produced isn't even fit to eat, not even by the farmers who grow it.  It tastes awful. But it's used to make food ""products"", corn syrup for instance, and make farmers more money when they sell it to big commercial food industries.If you need some serious inspiration to start your diet anew this may be it.  Watch out for all that corn.  It's in everything.",4,Everything you ever wanted to know about corn,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,2087,"['Corn', 'ubiquitous', 'everything', 'eat', 'even', 'number', 'one', 'nutrient', 'found', 'hair', 'documentary', 'new', 'light', 'obesity', 'epidemic', 'how', 'got', 'so', 'big.Corn', 'fed', 'cattle', 'poultry', 'fatten', 'up', 'it.Blame', 'Earl', 'Butz', 'Nixon', 'secretary', 'agriculture', 'elderly', 'gentleman', 'movie', 'remembers', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'government', 'paid', 'farmer', 'not', 'produce', 'much', 'corn.People', 'were', 'less', 'obese', 'back', 'then', 'food', 'cost', 'more', 'now', 'much', 'cheaper', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'three', 'adults', 'overweight.An', 'acre', 'corn', 'costs', '350', 'grow', 'brings', '325', 'open', 'market.Farmers', 'make', 'money', 'corn', 'government', 'subsidies', 'allow', 'make', 'around', '27', 'acre', 'So', 'keep', 'getting', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'corn', 'grower', 'farming', 'thousands', 'acres', 'only', '18', 'minutes', 'plant', '31,000', 'corn', 'kernals', 'using', 'machinery', 'Everything', 'automated', 'Specially', 'hybridized', 'corn', 'can', 'produce', 'staggering', 'two', 'hundred', 'bushels', 'acre', 'opposed', 'only', 'forty', 'bushels', 'acre', 'nineteen', 'fifties.Documentarian', 'Aaron', 'Woolfe', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'here', 'real', 'eye', 'great', 'photography', 'midwest', 'cornbelt', 'here', 'mountains', 'corn', 'being', 'spewed', 'huge', 'machines', 'piles', 'ground.I', 'took', 'off', 'one', 'star', 'watching', 'so', 'much', 'corn', 'possible', 'aspect', 'started', 'get', 'bit', 'boring', 'never', 'wanted', 'see', 'think', 'corn', 'again', 'least', 'while', 'watching', 'However', 'documentary', 'five', 'stars', 'great', 'photography', 'thouroughness', 'covering', 'subject.This', 'really', 'lot', 'think', 'diet', 'wise', 'most', 'corn', 'produced', ""n't"", 'even', 'fit', 'eat', 'not', 'even', 'farmers', 'who', 'grow', 'awful', 'used', 'make', 'food', 'products', 'corn', 'syrup', 'instance', 'make', 'farmers', 'more', 'money', 'when', 'sell', 'big', 'commercial', 'food', 'industries.If', 'need', 'serious', 'inspiration', 'start', 'diet', 'may', 'be', 'Watch', 'out', 'corn', 'everything']",King Corn

There are two sides to genetic and we only see one. Our presenters spit their Cornell thing you taste like chalk. But I can go down to the local store and pioneer of corn peel back the leaves, removed some of the silk, and munch away. In fact I use it many times just as a meal.We learn how to make corn syrup in the kitchen sink. We find this corn syrup in the soda we drink. However the argument that they bring up against corn syrup can easily be turned in to an argument against sugar. Speaking of sugar with a little bit of research you can find versions of Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper made with real sugar. And it will easily pass the blind taste test. Coca-Cola knowing that people could tell the difference pulled the real thing off the market replacing it with New Coke and when all the sugar drinks for off the market replace them with corn syrup with the misnomer of Classic Coke. If you switch to Izze esque you just get 50 calories of fruit juice.There is a small reference to ethanol which is being used as an excuse to raise the price of corn in food. We all know that we can get cheaper sugar from other countries and make cheaper ethanol and lower the price of corn to make cheaper foods.There are some vulgar scenes of reaching into cow stomachs that you may want to fast forward through. However in the process they make you understand that too much corn is not that good for cows and cows full of corn are not good for people. And again they forget to tell you with a little research you can find grass fed meat. You might also find Buffalo more to your liking then cows.This film does not tell us anything we do not already know.  But it can be overwhelming to see it all in one film. The presentation written by Aaron Woolf, Ian Cheney, Curt Ellis and Jeffery K. Miller, seems to lose focus now and then; it is part documentary, part mockumentary and par ""who do you think you are?""  This film is still worth watching but every once in a while you wonder if they know for whom they are making it.What I find fascinating about this presentation is that years ago we used to say we were eating oil as that is what the fertilizer is made of that we use to make corn and lose some of the energy on the way.I always wonder if films like this ever change things or if they are ever viewed by the people that created this monstrosity? It is like watching the bad guy and not realizing they are talking about you.For people interested in the media the pictures are crisp the background music does not drowned out the speakers.  There are the standard Bonus Materials as carrying their corn to the Chicago Board of Trade. Subsides are explained in Washington.

1135227,A2WJ6Y2KOXJ6FD,B0012680D0,Cerebellum,"[0, 0]","King Corn is a very informative, and sightly disturbing documentary about the American food chain. Two friends from the city travel west to the small town of Greene, Iowa to plant one acre of corn. They do this to try and learn, and show others, what corn farming has become. While in that small town, they interview many wonderful farmers and even see some old family photos. By strange coincidence, the friends who did this documentary both had relatives in this very small town. They do all this while they grow their corn, and sell it on the corn market. They document this whole process very well, and turn it into the documentary: King Corn.Riddled with many facts, statistics, interviews with corn farmers, and stop motion with corn kernels, King corn informs you of the many problems with American Food. First off, corn is in almost everything we eat, the average American even has corn in their hair. Then it tells of the large amounts of pesticides and chemicals used to grow corn. They can not be good for the health of the corn plant, or the health of the organisms who consume it. It also discuses how terrible a diet of corn is for cattle, and that nearly every cattle farm in America feeds their cattle corn. In addition to all this, the documentary is funny, has a very personal and small-town-America edge to it. All of this, and more, combine to make this an excellent documentary.  It has really made me question th quality of the food I eat.

One of the detrimental by-products of 'cheap corn' is HFCS (high fructose corn syrup, now in most of our processed foods) which has largely helped shape the obesity epidemic and declining health that seems to be getting only worse here in the U.S., and world-wide in most industrialized nations. In addition, the film delves into how our meat has changed as well, and not for the better.  Farm animals are mostly fed inexpensive corn based by-product meal, which fattens them up and makes them get to market faster, but increases the fat content of beef.  In addition, antibiotics are pumped into these animals in order to keep them alive and healthy until slaughter, because this diet is unhealthy to the animal, and they are prone to more illnesses as well.  The facts unfold as 2 young men friends move from Boston to Iowa to trace their family's roots and to expose how the current agricultural system creates abundance on the one hand, but makes many sick by imbibing HFCS (and GMO corn) on the other hand!

Clendenin,"[43, 48]","This documentary film is a sort of prequel to Fast Food Nation, and does for film what Michael Pollan has done in his two books, The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food. Best friends Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis relocate from the east coast to Greene, Iowa (population 1,015) to grow an acre of corn and then follow its fortunes after harvest. Planting an acre of 31,000 genetically modified kernels takes eighteen minutes. Fertilizers, sprays, water and time will yield about 200 bushels or 10,000 pounds of corn. That's why there are literal mountains of corn in Iowa. But none of it is edible, and was ever intended to be, until it is artificially processed. Over half of the crop goes to feed cattle, another third goes for ethanol and exports, and then a significant minority of it goes to make high fructose corn syrup and similar sweeteners that you'll find on virtually every label of processed food. In short, this is corn that is not really food. Cheney and Ellis netted a loss of $19.92 on their acre of corn, but that's before massive government subsidies put them in the black.

Their plan is to plant an acre of corn and follow that corn to market and see what happens. They want to know what life is like for the farmers and they want to know how the corn is processed and eventually consumed. What they find out is mixed.They learn about the high yields that are possible today with the variety of corn that dominates corn production in this country. This plant has the property of being able to grow close to others of its kind, thereby increasing the number of plants per acre. This is good no doubt. However this variety of corn while ideal for the making of high fructose corn syrup and ethanol is lower in other nutrients such as protein and oil. For my perspective this too is okay. If that is what sells, the farmer really doesn't have much choice.But what is disturbing about the corn farming and processing business are the subsidies that go to big agriculture and the consolidation that has taken place turning small farms into huge farms. Monoculture is a disease of the land. If more small farmers were able to make a living planting different varieties of crops people would eat better and healthier.Cheney and Ellis also learn that much of the corn is used to fatten cattle. The natural diet of cattle is grass. Fattening them with nothing but corn makes them sick, but not sick enough to die before being slaughtered for the market.They also learn (if they hadn't already known it) that corn is in an amazing number of the processed foods in the supermarkets and is the basis of McDonald happy meals. In other words king corn is instrumental in fostering and abetting the obesity epidemic.The documentary is fascinating because it shows the exact details of how planting, weeding (chemically), fertilizing, harvesting and marketing of the corn is done. There are conversations with farmers and others and the famous food writer Michael Pollan makes an appearance.This is not a documentary that is going to please the corn industry, but it is not a polemic either. I thought it was fair and accurate as far as I know. I am on the side of more diversified farming organically, but I know that feeding the seven plus billion people on this planet isn't possible without mass agricultural methods such as seen in this video. The fact that our government insists on subsidizing a relatively unhealthy diet based on genetically modified corn and soy is the main culprit. If there were subsidies for farmers to plant a wider variety of crops using organic methods that would improve our diet and allow for sustainable agriculture. The problem with this is we would need a larger percent of the population to farm.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""The World Is Not as We Think It Is""",5,Low key but very revealing and interesting,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,2940,"['interesting', 'informative', 'documentary', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Ian', 'Cheney', 'Curt', 'Ellis', 'return', 'east', 'coast', 'Iowa', 'farm', 'country', 'ancestors', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'be', 'corn', 'farmer', 'America', 'plan', 'plant', 'acre', 'corn', 'follow', 'corn', 'market', 'see', 'what', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'life', 'farmers', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'corn', 'processed', 'eventually', 'consumed', 'What', 'find', 'out', 'mixed.They', 'learn', 'high', 'yields', 'are', 'possible', 'today', 'variety', 'corn', 'corn', 'production', 'country', 'plant', 'property', 'being', 'able', 'grow', 'close', 'others', 'kind', 'thereby', 'increasing', 'number', 'plants', 'acre', 'good', 'doubt', 'However', 'variety', 'corn', 'ideal', 'making', 'high', 'fructose', 'corn', 'syrup', 'ethanol', 'lower', 'other', 'nutrients', 'such', 'protein', 'oil', 'perspective', 'too', 'okay', 'farmer', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'choice.But', 'what', 'disturbing', 'corn', 'farming', 'processing', 'business', 'are', 'subsidies', 'go', 'big', 'agriculture', 'consolidation', 'taken', 'place', 'turning', 'small', 'farms', 'huge', 'farms', 'Monoculture', 'disease', 'land', 'more', 'small', 'farmers', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'living', 'planting', 'different', 'varieties', 'crops', 'people', 'would', 'eat', 'better', 'healthier.Cheney', 'Ellis', 'also', 'learn', 'much', 'corn', 'used', 'fatten', 'cattle', 'natural', 'diet', 'cattle', 'grass', 'Fattening', 'nothing', 'corn', 'sick', 'not', 'sick', 'enough', 'die', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'market.They', 'also', 'learn', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'known', 'corn', 'amazing', 'number', 'processed', 'foods', 'supermarkets', 'basis', 'McDonald', 'happy', 'meals', 'other', 'words', 'king', 'corn', 'instrumental', 'fostering', 'abetting', 'obesity', 'epidemic.The', 'documentary', 'fascinating', 'exact', 'details', 'how', 'planting', 'weeding', 'chemically', 'fertilizing', 'harvesting', 'marketing', 'corn', 'done', 'are', 'conversations', 'farmers', 'others', 'famous', 'food', 'writer', 'Michael', 'Pollan', 'appearance.This', 'not', 'documentary', 'going', 'please', 'corn', 'industry', 'not', 'polemic', 'either', 'thought', 'was', 'fair', 'accurate', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'am', 'side', 'more', 'diversified', 'farming', 'organically', 'know', 'feeding', 'seven', 'billion', 'people', 'planet', ""n't"", 'possible', 'mass', 'agricultural', 'methods', 'such', 'seen', 'video', 'fact', 'government', 'subsidizing', 'relatively', 'unhealthy', 'diet', 'based', 'genetically', 'modified', 'corn', 'soy', 'main', 'culprit', 'were', 'subsidies', 'farmers', 'plant', 'wider', 'variety', 'crops', 'using', 'organic', 'methods', 'would', 'improve', 'diet', 'allow', 'sustainable', 'agriculture', 'problem', 'would', 'need', 'larger', 'percent', 'population', 'farm.', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'World', 'Not', 'Think']",King Corn

KING CORN confirms what you've heard about high fructose corn syrup, one major result of the post-1970s corn glut, but includes information you may not have.Almost as remarkable as KING CORN's take on the worrisome corn-dominated American diet are the film's hosts, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis.  Because they are not journalists, Cheney and Ellis are not making KING CORN as a natural extension of gathering news the way Michael Moore does in documentaries such as ROGER AND ME and SICKO.  Both Boston, Massachusetts, city dwellers, Cheney and Ellis are not even farmers.  The entertaining personalities of these young men make KING CORN even easier to view as we watch them farm their own acre of land.

They even prove able skit players in the KING CORN D.V.D. extras.Mention the name Earl Butz and KING CORN now competes with the late secretary of agriculture's famously ignorant remark about African Americans as the first thought to come to mind.  KING CORN points to Butz's 1970s drive to make American corn abundantly cheap as the start of America's bad diet.  Butz, whom KING CORN interviews prior to his 2008 death, still brags that the American corn-ucopia makes food inexpensive.  Either he does not see or won't admit that corn's profusion  changes it from food to just a raw material, the resulting high fructose corn syrup explosion contributing to record weight gain in America.

1135262,AB6BQXTOMO7F7,B0012680D0,PJS1975,"[6, 25]","I watched this snorefest at the behest of a friend who couldn't stop talking about how great it was. The short review is, ""See `Food, Inc.' instead. Or read books by noted authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser, which are packed with useful and, in many cases, lifestyle-changing bits of info.""But because ""King Corn"" is being billed as a ""documentary"", let's take a good ol' fashioned gander at what exactly is being documented here.The story opens in the offices of a man who is never named or otherwise identified (physicist? college professor? grad student with 24-7 lab access?), who performs a RIVETING, off-camera isotopic hair analysis on documentarians/stars Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis. The analysis produces some likewise earth-shattering results: Cheney and Ellis find that approximately 60% of their hair contains the isotopic signature of (drumroll) corn.Astonishing! Or, it would be, if corn derivatives were not already found in numerous shampoos (though on most product labels it appears as ""hydrolyzed vegetable proteins"") as well as in cosmetics and other things we rub into our hair and/or our bodies. But no one ever tells you that their shampoo or foundation gave them diabetes, or made them fat.Cheney and Ellis's riveting search for answers to this isotopic dilemma takes them to their natal country, the land of their birthright, reposing amidst the emerald splendours of Iowa's scenic ""corn belt"", which comprises the entire state.Verily, I sing to thee of Greene, Iowa.Jewel of Butler County, Greene is set in the midst of such dazzling cosmopolitan centers as New Hartford and Parkersburg. Cheney and Ellis contact a local farmer in advance of their arrival in riveting, stunning Iowa, and ask his express permission to use one acre of his land in order to grow corn. That single acre forms the catalyst which springboards our dynamic duo into a new world of exciting knowledge and brilliantly provocative socio-economic and nutritional insights, as they proceed to:1.) Tour the vicinity of Greene, taking in breathtaking vistas of corn-related scenery2.) Talk to a state licensed agricultural advisor at a seed wholesaler's shop about what kind of dirt their acre of land contains, and how they ought to plant corn in it3.) Drive a big tractor over their acre to create furrows to plant corn in4.) Plant corn in their acre5.) Fertilize their corn kernels6.) Wait for their corn to grow7.) Talk to some local farmers who also grow corn and/or raise cattle about some of the issues currently plaguing the commercial farming industry (whence arrives the shocking Verdict: the procedures which the corporate ""Big Farming"" consortiums use to produce tremendous amounts of corn are harmful to the average corn consumer, to the environment, and to the cornfed cattle being consumed by the average corn consumer... info we've been aware of for the past couple of decades, at least)8.) Find an absolutely riveting hemp plant growing in the midst of their corn (there is an entire scene devoted to this)9.) Wait some more for their corn to grow10.) Talk to random, unidentified persons in fast food restaurant parking lots who seem to possess a lot of ""big picture"" knowledge concerning the corn- and cattle-farming industries11.) Wait some more for their corn to grow12.) Use a montage of ""cold call"" footage to document their efforts to bring a camera crew to a factory that makes corn syrup, which are mercilessly thwarted by the point blank refusals of corporate PR depts. This is something which this documentary attempts to cast in a suspicion-rousing, chin-pulling, ""Hmm, what is this industry hiding from us"" light - when the fact is, almost any factory would flatly refuse to allow total strangers calling on the phone to just show up with a camera crew at the factory doors and tour the plant, because it so happens that this is a great way for competing companies to observe and film certain time-saving and/or money-saving copyrighted manufacturing processes which would then give them an edge in the market.13.) Get bored waiting for their corn to grow tall, and start playing impromptu baseball games in order to pass the time.14.) Build a baseball diamond in the middle of their cornfield (No, wait, that was `Field of Dreams')15.) Direct sidelong glances of counterfeit ""say what?"" toward one another during interviews in which an expert informs them that the strain of corn being grown in Iowa has no nutritional value whatsoever16.) Watch their corn grow tall17.) Use riveting stop-motion animations of corn kernels that spread across a map in brushfire fashion, or else march in front of the camera in neat, little lines, to illustrate their brilliant points18.) Harvest their corn19.) Masticate some of their corn and quickly come to the realization that it is inedible, unless it is heavily processed first20.) Interview a New York cabbie who propounds the theory that consuming too much soda made him and his immediate family diabetic and obese21.) Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....So, to sum up, a few snippets of an interview with author Michael Pollan (In Defense of Food) do not make this worth an hour and thirty minutes of your time.And, I might finally add, the popcorn my girlfriend and I ate during this movie was infinitely more satisfying than the movie itself was.",1,King Bored: You Are What You Watch,1316563200,"09 21,

Most of the corn we grow in our 'breadbasket' is inedible for humans, and is used as feedgrain for cows (I wonder how much the cows like it as well).In addition to documenting their farming experiment, the filmmakers visited a massive cattle feedlot in Colorado.  It brought to mind another movie that explores our meat industryFast Food Nation.  As the meat industry, like the cigarette industry, increases their global marketing, ever increasing amounts of grain are being used to feed cattle; along with creating fuels.  Amazingly, some crops are being genetically modified to produce pharmaceuticalsTransgenic Plants: A Production System for Industrial and Pharmaceutical Proteins.With growing food crises around the world, one wonders when we'll reach a tipping point and decide to create a food system that serves people instead of serving the interests of executives at Cargill and Archer Daniels MidlandRats in the Grain: The Dirty Tricks and Trials of Archer Daniels Midland, the Supermarket to the World.

1135267,A387BD735MI50R,B0012680D0,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","Two friends from college decided to track the process of growing America's #1 crop - corn. We see them rent their own acre of land and start, literally from scratch.They learn some of the evils and the economies of what has become the big business of agriculture - in some ways following in the footsteps of Roger Moore. They produce an eye-opening documentary. However these two pals do their investigating in a hands-on, non-confrontational way. As much as possible, they become a part of the Iowa community where they start their jovially hip adventure.They usher us through the process of sowing and reaping the corn, as it is done now with giant combines yielding billions of tons of grain every year. Then the friends pursue their crop as it is traded and processed, and as it makes its way to our tables in one form or another.They show how ubiquitous a part of our lives corn is. It is added as sweetener to almost all the processed food products we eat now, perhaps contributing to the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. It is the staple ingredient in most cattle feed. All of this commercial corn is foul-tasting, almost inedible in its primary raw state.The two young men do a good job of showing the details of the journey the corn makes from seed to feed. They include the way the crop is fertilized using ammonia. They touch on the herbicides sprayed on the fields and how these chemicals do their work of eradicating weeds without harming the young corn shoots. However, there's one glaring omission. The pals don't discuss pesticides at all, and seem not to have used any on their God's Little Acre.But the two also take the larger view. They probe the different philosophies that have guided Government programs dealing with farmers. They even track down Earl Butz, the controversial Secretary of Agriculture in the Nixon-Ford Administration, and interview him. He explains how he revamped and reversed the system of incentives given to farmers. He saw that they were paid, not for how much land they withheld from production, but for how much land they planted. This policy has contributed to the near-glut of corn on the market and to the creation of vast monoculture farms.There's a wealth of information in this documentary, presented in a lively, engaging way.

They come off as fatalistically pragmatic.

1135269,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B0012680D0,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[183, 189]","King Corn is kind of likeSuper Size Me's little brother. It traces the pervasive influence of corn on modern America, including the obesity epidemic and the fact that Iowa is growing trillions of bushels of *non-edible* corn to continue receiving lucrative government subsidies. College buddies Ian and Curt, both from the east coast, discover that they both had distant relatives from the same small town of Greene, Iowa. Ian and Curt decide to go to Iowa and plant one acre of corn, following it through its lifecycle, including where it goes after the harvest.The film starts off slowly as the reasons for the trip are explained. The prerequisite talking heads introduce some scary factoids about how Americans are literally made of corn; if you do a hair analysis, it's like a diet diary, and the vast majority of the American diet (corn-fed beef, fast foods and processed foods) contains corn derivatives. Much of the corn we ingest is in the guise of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a cheaper alternative to sugar that is produced via a scary chemical conversion involving several toxic acids.  HFCS has been directly linked to the current obesity crisis and its impact on Type II Diabetes (the body processes HFCS differently from table sugar). Prior to the 1970s, hardly any company used HFCS due to its high cost. But after then-Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz did away with the old New Deal market control policies in favor of rapid expansion in 1973, there was a constant surplus of cheap (and non-edible) corn, fueling the rapid expansion of the corn syrup industry. Here's a quick test: walk into any convenience store and count how many items contain corn, specifically corn syrup. The list includes obvious choices like soda and candy, but you'll also find HFCS in deli meats, breads, ketchup, pickle relish, spaghetti sauce, and cough syrup.  Oh yes, and one main variety of corn grown in Iowa (Liberty) is genetically modified, as is at least one ingredient in HFCS manufacturing.Corn production geared towards ethanol is briefly mentioned, but the majority of the focus in King Corn is on the impact of non-edible corn on the nation's food supply. In this respect, it's kind of a gentler version of Supersize Me; there's no shock value for the most part. Also mentioned is the disastrous consequence of converting cattle from grazing animals to force-fed confined ones. Cattle normally forage for a plant-based diet, but it is far more profitable to bring them up to market weight by forcing them to stand still and eat continuously. In addition, the acids present in corn cause deadly ulcers for the cows, who are slaughtered before developing acidosis.  The end result is that 70% of the antibiotics in the US are used on livestock (antibiotics combat both the acidosis and the infections resulting from confinement).  Literally everything at McDonald's contains corn: your hamburger is corn-fed, the bun contains HFCS, your soda contains HFCS, the French fries are fried in corn (or soybean) oil, and your ketchup and pickle contains HFCS. Ditto for most vending machine foods, frozen dinners, and anything you don't make from scratch. It's extremely difficult to escape buying foods containing corn, since a variety of pseudonyms are used, including baking powder, caramel color, dextrose, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stearic acid, and vanilla, making it a nightmare for anyone with corn allergies.Perhaps the most effective element is that of nostalgia. Ian and Curt also take time to find their long-lost relatives in Greene, and to reflect on the rapid changes in our recently agrarian society that have forced farmers to maintain massive farms harvesting non-edible corn. In other words, the farmer can't even feed himself with what he's growing. Without the hefty government subsidies, such large-scale corn operations would be out of business. They interview various farmers and ranchers who are disgusted with the system, but who have little real choice (one farmer says flatly, ""We're growing crap!""). We're shown the evolution of farming equipment and of the family farm itself as a quaint reminder of the past; there are nostalgic shots of Main Street and hometown parades, quiet diners and local bars.Ian and Curt's visual style is playful; the charts and graphs are hand-drawn, interspersed with stop-motion plastic farm toys to get the point across (and the dancing corn on the map of the US was great, too).  The quirky soundtrack is a standout as well. DVD extras include some outtakes, a music video, bios, and some great 1950s-style educational clips.

1135270,A38X3820MO0TAN,B0012680D0,Sony XL,"[1, 2]","I wouldn't say this was a horrible movie, but it certainly wasn't a good one. I think a lot of people think that if the movie's informative or says something you agree with, that makes it a good documentary. I didn't have a problem with the subject matter, it's the way it was presented.The filmmakers made the choice of inserting themselves into the film. This can be a very effective documentary style (see Michael Moore & Morgan Spurlock for example) but in this case, no offense guys, you just don't have the personality to pull that off. You're not funny, you're not witty, you're not interesting, you're just two dudes floating through this film as if bystanders - which is fine, but then be bystanders, don't be in front of the camera. Don't take offense to that - a lot of people would not be suitable for this type of documentary, including me.One example: there was a shot in the taxicab where the camera lingers on one of the guys (I don't know their names - and it doesn't matter) presumably to capture his emotional response to some horrible story the driver just told him, yet he's just staring blankly. What emotion was that supposed to be conveying? Either have a reaction worthy of showing us or leave that on the cutting room floor.Second problem: The filmmakers try to make it look like they're just two schmoes who are clueless about this stuff and are just trying to figure out how corn got into the molecules of their hair. Right. That's insulting our intelligence and just got more & more annoying as the movie went on. You obviously were educated about this topic and that's why you did the movie in the first place.Third problem: I thought the point of growing an acre of corn was to see what happened to it. But since it's impossible to follow what happened to their one acre of corn because it gets mixed in with everyone else's, that makes that whole part of the movie pointless. At that point they're just doing a more traditional kind of documentary and it was even less important to have them in the story. Yes they still got to show some information about how corn is planted & raised, but they could have shown that, and to better effect, by hanging out with farmers handling real crops.Fourth problem: I don't remember all the details, but they calculated (spoiler alert?) that if not for the government's checks they would have lost money. Perhaps this is a valid point but using their calculations and drawing conclusions from that is complete B.S. If you were a real farmer, you'd probably own your own equipment, or if not you wouldn't be renting equipment in order to farm one acre of land for 18 minutes. Of course that's not economical!! Fifth problem: Munching into an ear of corn wasn't tasty... well duh, it wasn't sweet corn. There are different varieties of corn. Biting into raw popcorn wouldn't taste good either.

Usually with documentaries there is a complete one-sided view that typically bashes the other side. This one doesn't do that, instead it asks questions and seeks to find the answers. While I knew that corn syrup was in a good chunk of all the foods that are out there, I didn't realize it comes from mass produced corn that is inedible. Everything that they found while on their ""down time"" after planting 31,000 genetically modified seed in 18 minutes they traveled around the country to find out where the corn they grow ends up. This part of the movie was quite interesting but it seemed to point out this is a huge chunk of problem we have with obestity in this country, there are numerous other factors.Overall, I would watch this movie again even if it wasn't required. Since I needed to take notes on the film, I had a friend (not in my class) watch it as well and they were equally impressed. At no part in the movie did it lag or become repetitive, it was intriguing and informative.
