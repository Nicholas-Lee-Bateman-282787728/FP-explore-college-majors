I figured what the heck, I like this kind of stuff and this area is from the county south of where my dad's family originates. Its full of swamp people retelling their encounters and recollections of this beast.

It's clear that Dana got herself a video camera at Best Buy, called some of her friends and family, told them to put their teeth in, and decided to make a buck off the hoaxed footprints her dad made decades ago in the Lousiana swamps. The results are entertaining as hell!Smug, self-styled Rambo-wannabe swamp rats with big guts tell about terrifying encounters with monsters.  Drunks who slur out tales of ghastly meetings with the terrifying beast.  Even an interview in a living room in which a loud phone rings and the interviewee finally yells off-camera for someone to pick it up.  ""Expert"" guy talks about tree-dwelling swamp apes and how the cast of an alligator print Dana shows him is in fact, from just such a primate.  There's even a scene where the ""monster hunters"" break up a night time riverside party asking the kids if they've seen the monster.  Screams from the movie ""Snowbeast"" are broadcast from hidden speakers in an attempt to scare the kids. That fails and the kids sense a ""Punked""-style setup, so they leave.  So embarassing, it is almost impossible to watch...almost...Would I pay money for this DVD?  As a pure schlock-fest, it's entertaining, if somewhat wince-inducing.  As a ""documentary"" it's not worth a whole lot since there's no real insight into the hoaxing of footprints, the film, or any serious treatment of the ""legend."" In essence, it's a mockumentary in a Scooby-gang style, or a fan-film, and an amusing one at that!But plug it in, grab a case of Pabst or Hamm's and get ready to enjoy an hour and change if you've got some time to kill and like folk tales about boogeymen.",2,"Goofy, amateur production, and obvious hoaxes, but fun!",1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,1708,"['hardcore', 'Bigfoot', 'monster', 'fan', 'was', 'thrilled', 'get', 'DVD', 'birthday', 'gift', 'clear', 'Dana', 'got', 'video', 'camera', 'Best', 'Buy', 'called', 'friends', 'family', 'told', 'put', 'teeth', 'decided', 'make', 'buck', 'hoaxed', 'footprints', 'dad', 'made', 'decades', 'ago', 'Lousiana', 'swamps', 'results', 'are', 'entertaining', 'hell', 'Smug', 'self-styled', 'Rambo-wannabe', 'swamp', 'rats', 'big', 'guts', 'tell', 'terrifying', 'encounters', 'monsters', 'Drunks', 'who', 'slur', 'out', 'tales', 'ghastly', 'meetings', 'terrifying', 'beast', 'Even', 'interview', 'living', 'room', 'loud', 'phone', 'rings', 'interviewee', 'finally', 'off-camera', 'someone', 'pick', 'up', 'Expert', 'guy', 'talks', 'tree-dwelling', 'swamp', 'apes', 'how', 'cast', 'alligator', 'print', 'Dana', 'fact', 'just', 'primate', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'monster', 'hunters', 'break', 'up', 'night', 'time', 'riverside', 'party', 'asking', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'monster', 'movie', 'Snowbeast', 'are', 'broadcast', 'hidden', 'speakers', 'attempt', 'scare', 'kids', 'kids', 'sense', 'Punked', '-style', 'setup', 'leave', 'So', 'embarassing', 'almost', 'impossible', 'watch', 'almost', 'Would', 'pay', 'money', 'DVD', 'pure', 'schlock-fest', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'wince-inducing', 'documentary', 'not', 'worth', 'whole', 'lot', 'real', 'insight', 'hoaxing', 'footprints', 'film', 'serious', 'treatment', 'legend', 'essence', 'mockumentary', 'Scooby-gang', 'style', 'fan-film', 'amusing', 'one', 'grab', 'case', 'Pabst', 'Hamm', 'get', 'ready', 'enjoy', 'hour', 'change', ""'ve"", 'got', 'time', 'kill', 'folk', 'tales', 'boogeymen']",The Legend Of The Honey Island Swamp Monster
1112657,A2WSDEV7FP7QKR,B000X02HEE,"D ""Dave""","[1, 1]","Having watched this several times, I like it more each time. I keep it together with my other bigfoot documentaries. The sound is such that you want to play with the volume here and there. However, it is a lot of fun following the reporter as she interviews quite a long string of people regarding their very own encounters with the monster. Not all the people interviewed were talkative (or loud), so the reporter does a good job at getting them to talk with her various questions. No matter, the people interviewed seem credible. There is a swamp monster hunt at the end, followed up by early footage of the monster from Harlan Ford's camping trip. The swamp monster and bigfoot apparently are not 100% the same type of creature - based on the cast of the footprints. The sounds this creature makes is rather creepy. So what would be sufficient proof this creature exists? Had they captured video of the creature being shot down in broad daylight, dragged to the autopsy table, and poked and prodded and sliced and diced - this still would not be enough for some. This is one that should not be missed by the open minded, the big foot lovers, the X-Files lovers, the creepy campfire story lovers everwhere.",4,A Treat for Bigfoot Lovers Everywhere,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,1208,"['Having', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'like', 'more', 'time', 'keep', 'together', 'other', 'bigfoot', 'documentaries', 'sound', 'such', 'want', 'play', 'volume', 'here', 'there', 'However', 'lot', 'fun', 'following', 'reporter', 'quite', 'long', 'string', 'people', 'regarding', 'very', 'own', 'encounters', 'monster', 'Not', 'people', 'interviewed', 'were', 'talkative', 'loud', 'reporter', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'talk', 'various', 'questions', 'matter', 'people', 'interviewed', 'seem', 'credible', 'swamp', 'monster', 'hunt', 'end', 'followed', 'up', 'early', 'footage', 'monster', 'Harlan', 'Ford', 'camping', 'trip', 'swamp', 'monster', 'bigfoot', 'apparently', 'are', 'not', '100', '%', 'same', 'type', 'creature', 'based', 'cast', 'footprints', 'sounds', 'creature', 'rather', 'creepy', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'sufficient', 'proof', 'creature', 'Had', 'captured', 'video', 'creature', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'broad', 'daylight', 'dragged', 'autopsy', 'table', 'poked', 'prodded', 'sliced', 'diced', 'still', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'open', 'minded', 'big', 'foot', 'lovers', 'X-Files', 'lovers', 'creepy', 'campfire', 'story', 'lovers', 'everwhere']",The Legend Of The Honey Island Swamp Monster

1112659,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000X02HEE,Robert I. Hedges,"[4, 4]","""The Legend of the Honey Island Swamp Monster"" is an extremely low-budget bigfoot pseudo-documentary made by Dana Holyfield, granddaughter of the late Harland Ford, whose 1963 Louisiana swamp bigfoot footage inspired the project. While she is doubtlessly sincere in this project, the final product is highly unlikely to convert skeptics. The bulk of the DVD is interviews of locals and of a gentleman who is an author and ""authority in the field of alternative knowledge"", whatever that means. The remainder of the DVD is a nighttime trek through the swamps where there has been a Honey Island Swamp Monster sighting. There are lots of dogs barking, some unidentified sounds, a tailgate party gone awry, and an intense search for the creature...but it got away.The best footage in the DVD is from one of Harlan Ford's early 1970's color film reels which purports to show the monster, though it is behind a lot of foliage and appears extremely briefly just before he ran out of film. The worst aspects of the DVD are the general quality of the interviews, and the accompanying terrible audio quality, which makes hearing and understanding the native's testimonials very difficult. I realize, also, that the film was made on a small budget, but when faced with a miniscule budget, it's generally best not to have original bigfoot-themed music added to the soundtrack. The re-enactment footage at the opening of the film is also quite entertaining for all the wrong reasons.I am giving this DVD two stars. It is not of very high quality, and I seriously doubt many will be convinced by the presentation, but I do appreciate Dana Holyfield undertaking an independent film production. Although it's amateurish, she actually decided to make a movie about something she found compelling, did her very best, and made it happen. You have to admire tenaciousness, and in that regard bigfoot skeptics and believers alike owe her a thank you.",2,Bigfoot in the Big Easy,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,1930,"['Legend', 'Honey', 'Island', 'Swamp', 'Monster', 'extremely', 'low-budget', 'bigfoot', 'pseudo-documentary', 'made', 'Dana', 'Holyfield', 'granddaughter', 'late', 'Harland', 'Ford', '1963', 'Louisiana', 'swamp', 'bigfoot', 'footage', 'inspired', 'project', 'doubtlessly', 'sincere', 'project', 'final', 'product', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'convert', 'skeptics', 'bulk', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'locals', 'gentleman', 'who', 'author', 'authority', 'field', 'alternative', 'knowledge', 'remainder', 'DVD', 'nighttime', 'trek', 'swamps', 'where', 'been', 'Honey', 'Island', 'Swamp', 'Monster', 'sighting', 'are', 'lots', 'dogs', 'barking', 'unidentified', 'sounds', 'tailgate', 'party', 'gone', 'awry', 'intense', 'search', 'creature', 'got', 'away.The', 'best', 'footage', 'DVD', 'one', 'Harlan', 'Ford', 'early', '1970', 'color', 'film', 'reels', 'purports', 'show', 'monster', 'lot', 'foliage', 'extremely', 'briefly', 'just', 'ran', 'film', 'worst', 'aspects', 'DVD', 'are', 'general', 'quality', 'interviews', 'accompanying', 'terrible', 'audio', 'quality', 'hearing', 'understanding', 'native', 'testimonials', 'very', 'difficult', 'realize', 'also', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'when', 'faced', 'miniscule', 'budget', 'generally', 'best', 'not', 'have', 'original', 'bigfoot-themed', 'music', 'added', 'soundtrack', 're-enactment', 'footage', 'opening', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'wrong', 'reasons.I', 'am', 'giving', 'DVD', 'two', 'stars', 'not', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'convinced', 'presentation', 'do', 'appreciate', 'Dana', 'Holyfield', 'undertaking', 'independent', 'film', 'production', 'amateurish', 'actually', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'something', 'found', 'compelling', 'did', 'very', 'best', 'made', 'happen', 'have', 'admire', 'tenaciousness', 'regard', 'bigfoot', 'skeptics', 'believers', 'alike', 'owe', 'thank']",The Legend Of The Honey Island Swamp Monster
