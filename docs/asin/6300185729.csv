206111,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6300185729,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 2]","Director Ivan Reitman's LEGAL EAGLES (1986) stars Robert Redford, Debra Winger and Daryl Hannah and features Brian Dennehy, Terence Stamp, Stephen Hill, John McMartin and Roscoe Lee Browne.Here, Redford is an asst. DA, Winger a defense attorney who work together to solve a possible murder that occurred 18 years earlier. At that time an arson fire killed a painter and destroyed most of his work. In the present, the dead man's daughter (Hannah) steals a painting she claims was a 10th birthday gift from her dad.The two lawyers' investigation reveals that more than a single artwork may have survived the long ago fire and that gallery owner Stamp may somehow be involved. Dennehy is a NYC detective who worked the original case. He provides Winger and Redford some stolen evidence that puts them on Stamp's track.After Redford falls into bed with eccentric performance artist Hannah, the police burst in and arrest her for Stamp's murder. Of course she denies committing the crime. The story of a DA and accused killer cozying together make for lurid headlines. Redford quits the attorneys' office before he's fired, and he officially (if reluctantly) joins Winger as co-counsel on Hannah's case. Browne is the presiding judge.Outside the courtroom the film turns into a thriller, with Winger and Hannah searching the shadowy upper floors of Stamp's gallery for the missing painting and Redford, who appears just in time, grappling with the real killer after he immobilzes the two women and sets a covering fire. Their stuggle is brief, a flaw perhaps, but necessary with the blaze grown to an inferno.The ending of this picture underwent a few changes after review audiences gave it a so-so grade.Based on a somewhat confusing story and lack of chemistry between the two leads, a tepid 5.7 rating at IMDb seems about right.",3,"Hannah: ""Do you always cross-examine people?"" --- Redford: ""Only when they lie to me.""",1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,1827,"['Director', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'LEGAL', 'EAGLES', '1986', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'features', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Stephen', 'Hill', 'John', 'McMartin', 'Roscoe', 'Lee', 'Browne.Here', 'Redford', 'asst', 'DA', 'Winger', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'work', 'together', 'solve', 'possible', 'murder', 'occurred', '18', 'years', 'earlier', 'time', 'arson', 'fire', 'killed', 'painter', 'destroyed', 'most', 'work', 'present', 'dead', 'man', 'daughter', 'Hannah', 'painting', 'was', '10th', 'birthday', 'gift', 'dad.The', 'two', 'lawyers', 'investigation', 'reveals', 'more', 'single', 'artwork', 'may', 'have', 'survived', 'long', 'ago', 'fire', 'gallery', 'owner', 'Stamp', 'may', 'somehow', 'be', 'involved', 'Dennehy', 'NYC', 'detective', 'who', 'worked', 'original', 'case', 'Winger', 'Redford', 'stolen', 'evidence', 'Stamp', 'track.After', 'Redford', 'bed', 'eccentric', 'performance', 'artist', 'Hannah', 'police', 'burst', 'arrest', 'Stamp', 'murder', 'course', 'committing', 'crime', 'story', 'DA', 'accused', 'killer', 'cozying', 'together', 'make', 'lurid', 'headlines', 'Redford', 'attorneys', 'office', 'fired', 'officially', 'reluctantly', 'Winger', 'co-counsel', 'Hannah', 'case', 'Browne', 'presiding', 'judge.Outside', 'courtroom', 'film', 'thriller', 'Winger', 'Hannah', 'searching', 'shadowy', 'upper', 'floors', 'Stamp', 'gallery', 'missing', 'painting', 'Redford', 'who', 'just', 'time', 'grappling', 'real', 'killer', 'two', 'women', 'covering', 'fire', 'stuggle', 'brief', 'flaw', 'perhaps', 'necessary', 'blaze', 'grown', 'inferno.The', 'ending', 'picture', 'few', 'changes', 'review', 'audiences', 'gave', 'so-so', 'grade.Based', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'story', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'tepid', '5.7', 'rating', 'IMDb', 'about', 'right']",N/A

The movie begins with a birthday party that ends in a fire, killing a little girl's artist/father. Hardly a laughing matter. There is a secondary story line that plays off of the budding relationship between rival lawyers played by Redford and Winger, and it involves some mildly funny moments, but the main focus is always on missing paintings and, as things develop, murder victims. The laughs are chuckles, not belly laughs. &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; this isn't. The romance is tepid, too, but the acting is good and the mystery is involved enough to keep you interested.

Probably to remind us how fine an actress (even given this script....) Debra Winger was in those days. Also it provides a chance to see a younger Robert Redford in a whimsical role. Other than that, this film is one of those space fillers that has some occasional good lines and interesting situations for a story that began as an investigation of the rather grim haggling over the estate of brilliant painter Mark Rothko. A bit of interesting fact: Debra Winger actually left the powerful Creative Artists Agency over this film. She felt that since all the major cast and crew members were with CAA at the time, they did not hire the best people, they hired only clients who could get the film made!District Attorney Tom Logan (Robert Redford) is set for higher office, at least until he becomes involved with defense lawyer Laura Kelly (Debra Winger) and her unpredictable client, performance artist Chelsea Deardon (Daryl Hannah). It seems the least of Chelsea's crimes is the theft of a very valuable painting, but as the women persuade Logan to investigate further and to cut some official corners, a much more sinister scenario starts to emerge. The owner of the gallery Victor Taft (Terrance Stamp) manipulates and is manipulated and eventually murdered but not until the team of Logan and Kelly have at it in a romp that is supposed to be tense but results in being rather silly. And who is to blame for the murder? Why, Chelsea Deardon, of course, and it is up to our legal eagles to get her acquitted.Ivan Retiman (Ghostbusters) directs and also wrote (with Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr.) and the supporting cast includes such actors as Brian Dennehy, John McMartin, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Christine Baranski among a host of others.

206116,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6300185729,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I know the courtroom is supposed to be this hallowed venue where justice is meted out with dignity and decorum. But, man, do I love it when the circus comes to town. I watch the courtroom drama for the theatricality of it. I love it when this or that lawyer resorts to putting on a show and is threatened by the judge with being held in contempt. I love it when the incensed judge commands both counsels to approach the bench and then chews them out.To quote Assistant D. A. Tom Logan: ""A person is entitled to his or her own opinion. Lawyers have to prove theirs in court."" He said that in LEGAL EAGLES, a 1986 Ivan Reitman production. It's a film that tries to be all things to everyone. It's a courtroom drama, a whodunit, a romantic comedy, and an action thriller. That it works as a highly enjoyable picture is thanks largely to the inarguable chemistry between Robert Redford and Debra Winger. They play courtroom adversaries who end up putting their heads together to resolve a particularly explosive case.Tom Logan (Redford), polished and elegant, is being groomed as the next D.A. Laura J. Kelly (Winger) is a defense attorney who once tried to put a dog on the witness stand. They've only ever known each other peripherally in the court houses of Seattle. But this and that happens and Logan and Kelly find themselves in a lively partnership, probing a cover-up of an 18-year-old murder investigation.Ivan Reitman - who writes, produces, and directs the film - hedges his bets by introducing summer blockbuster beats, and I'm of course talking about all the scenes where things explode or get set on fire and cars crash and our heroes dodge bullets and plunge into the drink off a forklift. But you strip away all that and what's left is the film's saving grace. LEGAL EAGLES is never more captivating than when Redford and Winger are sharing the screen and engaged in banter. They're so watchable together, and Winger is so damn endearing here, and Redford is absolutely correct when he remarks on Winger's marvelous eyes. She uses them to wonderful effect. Maybe it's sacrilegious to compare Redford and Winger to Tracy and Hepburn in how they propel the age-old battle-of-the-sexes theme, but I'm comparing anyway.The screenplay invests our squabbling attorneys with affectionate character touches. Tom Logan tap dances in the bathroom whenever he gets insomnia. Laura Kelly is a backseat driver who doesn't know how to drive, and I know that that's not really an affectionate trait but damn if Winger isn't so likable that she turns that into winsome behavior. It's massive fun watching Logan's precision and elegance run into Kelly's imagination and unconventional methods.At this stage in her career, Daryl Hannah was still considered hot property, based on the cachet earned from earlier hits like BLADE RUNNER and SPLASH. She's again a hypnotic presence, here playing Chelsea Deardon, the troubled, enigmatic 26-year-old performance artist who becomes Kelly's client.It hearkens back to the screwballs of the 1930s and '40s. It's a sweet love story. It presents one of the most memorable (and combustible) opening statements an attorney will ever make in a courtroom. One of the film's flaws is that we never get enough of Logan and Kelly in court. I could've done with more personal moments between the two and maybe less of the explody stuff. I could've done with more of gazing into Debra Winger's eyes or her being a klutz or her just standing there being wonderful. Robert Redford's alright, too.",5,"""Objection, your honor, defense is fondling one of the jurors.""",1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,3519,"['know', 'courtroom', 'supposed', 'be', 'hallowed', 'venue', 'where', 'justice', 'meted', 'out', 'dignity', 'decorum', 'man', 'do', 'love', 'when', 'circus', 'town', 'watch', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'theatricality', 'love', 'when', 'lawyer', 'resorts', 'putting', 'show', 'threatened', 'judge', 'being', 'held', 'contempt', 'love', 'when', 'incensed', 'judge', 'counsels', 'approach', 'bench', 'then', 'chews', 'out.To', 'quote', 'Assistant', 'D.', 'A.', 'Tom', 'Logan', 'person', 'entitled', 'own', 'opinion', 'Lawyers', 'have', 'prove', 'theirs', 'court', 'said', 'LEGAL', 'EAGLES', '1986', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'production', 'film', 'be', 'things', 'everyone', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'whodunit', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'action', 'thriller', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'picture', 'thanks', 'largely', 'inarguable', 'chemistry', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'play', 'courtroom', 'adversaries', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'putting', 'heads', 'together', 'resolve', 'particularly', 'explosive', 'case.Tom', 'Logan', 'Redford', 'polished', 'elegant', 'being', 'groomed', 'next', 'D.A', 'Laura', 'J.', 'Kelly', 'Winger', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'once', 'tried', 'put', 'dog', 'witness', 'stand', ""'ve"", 'only', 'ever', 'known', 'other', 'peripherally', 'court', 'houses', 'Seattle', 'happens', 'Logan', 'Kelly', 'find', 'lively', 'partnership', 'probing', 'cover-up', '18-year-old', 'murder', 'investigation.Ivan', 'Reitman', 'who', 'produces', 'film', 'bets', 'introducing', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'beats', ""'m"", 'course', 'talking', 'scenes', 'where', 'things', 'explode', 'get', 'set', 'fire', 'cars', 'crash', 'heroes', 'dodge', 'bullets', 'plunge', 'drink', 'forklift', 'strip', 'away', 'what', 'left', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'LEGAL', 'EAGLES', 'never', 'more', 'captivating', 'when', 'Redford', 'Winger', 'are', 'sharing', 'screen', 'engaged', 'banter', ""'re"", 'so', 'watchable', 'together', 'Winger', 'so', 'damn', 'endearing', 'here', 'Redford', 'absolutely', 'correct', 'when', 'remarks', 'Winger', 'marvelous', 'eyes', 'wonderful', 'effect', 'sacrilegious', 'compare', 'Redford', 'Winger', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'how', 'propel', 'age-old', 'battle-of-the-sexes', 'theme', ""'m"", 'comparing', 'anyway.The', 'screenplay', 'squabbling', 'attorneys', 'affectionate', 'character', 'touches', 'Tom', 'Logan', 'tap', 'dances', 'bathroom', 'whenever', 'insomnia', 'Laura', 'Kelly', 'backseat', 'driver', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'drive', 'know', 'not', 'really', 'affectionate', 'trait', 'damn', 'Winger', ""n't"", 'so', 'likable', 'winsome', 'behavior', 'massive', 'fun', 'watching', 'Logan', 'precision', 'elegance', 'run', 'Kelly', 'imagination', 'unconventional', 'methods.At', 'stage', 'career', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'was', 'still', 'considered', 'hot', 'property', 'based', 'cachet', 'earned', 'earlier', 'hits', 'BLADE', 'RUNNER', 'SPLASH', 'again', 'hypnotic', 'presence', 'here', 'playing', 'Chelsea', 'Deardon', 'troubled', 'enigmatic', '26-year-old', 'performance', 'artist', 'who', 'Kelly', 'client.It', 'back', 'screwballs', '1930s', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'combustible', 'opening', 'statements', 'attorney', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'courtroom', 'One', 'film', 'flaws', 'never', 'get', 'enough', 'Logan', 'Kelly', 'court', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'more', 'personal', 'moments', 'two', 'maybe', 'less', 'explody', 'stuff', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'more', 'gazing', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'eyes', 'being', 'klutz', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'being', 'wonderful', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'alright', 'too']",N/A

This was before preview screenings were done as much as they were now by radio stations and more. It was a bit of a special thing in my mind.I remember enjoying it on a interplay between Redford and Winger level and thinking of it as a good but not great movie.About a month later, the film opened to mediocre reviews and business.After that, the movie would turn up on TV and when I caught it, I found myself seeing it thorugh to the end (only to be surprised when the TV version had an altered ending).Anyway, Legal Eagles became that ""old comfortable shoe"" of a movie that when it popped up on cable (and for a while it often did)I would go ""ahhhh"" and keep on watching.I would've gotten it on VHS, but I was all too aware of how the movie was cropped and zoomed and that was good enough to watch on TV but not good enough to buy. I would wait until I got a laserdisc player and get it in widescreen (laserdiscs, those things that look like big DVD's before they had DVD's)The rest is history of course, then came DVD. When I got a DVD player, a widescreen Legal Eagles DVD was available for about [44] so there you go.This was the first release (from Image) though, single layer non-anamorphic widescreen and no extras. The single layer made for some noticable compression artifacts when I viewed it on my newer high tech TV (especially on Daryl Hannah's face during her performance piece). Also, the audio on the disc seemed a bit weak.But then, just a couple weeks ago, I saw the newer release for Legal Eagles. Dual layer, anamorphic widescreen (which my new TV can take advantage of)plus a trailer and a vintage featurette. Terrific.This transfer is much improved from the first release, though it still has a bit of softness and grain to it.The soundtrack is improved from the first release too, more accurately reproducing the Dolby Surround mix I remember hearing in that preview screening.Please note that this new release has misprints on the specifications on the back.It lists the video as ""1.85 to 1 anamorphic widescreen"" when it's actually 2.35 to 1 Anamorphic.It also lists the audio as ""2.0 mono"" when it is actually 2.0 Dolby Surround.So, people thinking of picking up this on DVD remember to get the updated version (with the blue tone background on the cover) instead of the old one (with the pinkish tone background on the cover).",4,Low key but enjoyable,1057795200,"07 10, 2003",2003,2599,"['Ivan', 'Reitman', 'first', 'film', 'mega', 'hit', 'Ghostbusters', '.Some', 'will', 'even', 'recognize', 'exterior', 'two', 'was', 'used', 'films.I', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'film', 'got', 'pass', 'preview', 'screening', 'art', 'teacher', 'was', 'preview', 'screenings', 'were', 'done', 'as', 'much', 'were', 'now', 'radio', 'stations', 'more', 'was', 'bit', 'special', 'thing', 'mind.I', 'remember', 'enjoying', 'interplay', 'Redford', 'Winger', 'level', 'thinking', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'month', 'later', 'film', 'opened', 'mediocre', 'reviews', 'business.After', 'movie', 'would', 'turn', 'up', 'TV', 'when', 'caught', 'found', 'seeing', 'end', 'only', 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'TV', 'version', 'had', 'altered', 'ending', '.Anyway', 'Legal', 'Eagles', 'became', 'old', 'comfortable', 'shoe', 'movie', 'when', 'popped', 'up', 'cable', 'while', 'often', 'did', 'would', 'go', 'ahhhh', 'keep', 'watching.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'VHS', 'was', 'too', 'aware', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'cropped', 'zoomed', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'TV', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'buy', 'would', 'wait', 'got', 'laserdisc', 'player', 'get', 'widescreen', 'laserdiscs', 'things', 'look', 'big', 'DVD', 'had', 'DVD', 'rest', 'history', 'course', 'then', 'came', 'DVD', 'When', 'got', 'DVD', 'player', 'widescreen', 'Legal', 'Eagles', 'DVD', 'was', 'available', '[', '44', ']', 'so', 'there', 'go.This', 'was', 'first', 'release', 'Image', 'single', 'layer', 'non-anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'extras', 'single', 'layer', 'made', 'noticable', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'when', 'viewed', 'newer', 'high', 'tech', 'TV', 'especially', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'face', 'performance', 'piece', 'Also', 'audio', 'disc', 'seemed', 'bit', 'weak.But', 'then', 'just', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'saw', 'newer', 'release', 'Legal', 'Eagles', 'Dual', 'layer', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'new', 'TV', 'can', 'take', 'advantage', 'trailer', 'vintage', 'featurette', 'Terrific.This', 'transfer', 'much', 'improved', 'first', 'release', 'still', 'bit', 'softness', 'grain', 'it.The', 'soundtrack', 'improved', 'first', 'release', 'too', 'more', 'accurately', 'reproducing', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'mix', 'remember', 'hearing', 'preview', 'screening.Please', 'note', 'new', 'release', 'misprints', 'specifications', 'back.It', 'video', '1.85', '1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'when', 'actually', '2.35', '1', 'Anamorphic.It', 'also', 'audio', '2.0', 'mono', 'when', 'actually', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Surround.So', 'people', 'thinking', 'picking', 'up', 'DVD', 'remember', 'get', 'updated', 'version', 'blue', 'tone', 'background', 'cover', 'instead', 'old', 'one', 'pinkish', 'tone', 'background', 'cover']",N/A

206124,A15XTHGM4VS4WH,6300185729,Rennie Petersen,"[2, 4]","""Legal Eagles"" is supposed to be a comedy. We're supposed to find the characters played by Robert Redford and Debra Winger to be amusing, their acrimonious relationship to be hilarious, and the way that they end up being partners despite all of the gibes to be romantically satisfying.The problem is that the movie is too dumb to be taken seriously, and thus too dumb to be funny.Briefly, the story takes place in New York. Robert Redford is an assistant District Attorney about to be promoted to be the DA. Debra Winger is a defense attorney, and Daryl Hannah is a young woman with emotional problems, and is Debra Winger's client. The plot involves a fire 20 years ago, when Daryl Hannah was eight, a fire that killed her artist father and purportedly destroyed a large number of his paintings. This experience left Daryl Hannah traumatized, but all is not as it seems, and now, 20 years later, Daryl Hannah is first accused of attempted theft and later of murder.Unfortunately, the plot involves many elements that simply don't make sense. I won't go into detail, but Roger Ebert does a good job of listing four different major things that make the plot completely unbelievable.As well as the story being dumb I found some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny to be anything but.For example, Robert Redford is a weekend father to a teenage daughter. At one point his ex-wife threatens to go to court to prevent him from seeing their daughter. Robert Redford makes a telephone call to his ex-wife's home and starts an angry monologue of threats about how he'll take her apart in court. Then he realizes that he's actually talking to his daughter! This mistake is apparently supposed to be hilarious. Ha, ha.In another scene Robert Redford and Debra Winger are together and see one of the bad guys. Robert Redford takes off on foot to try to catch him. Debra Winger, who doesn't know how to drive a car, feels it necessary for her to jump into Robert Redford's car and try to follow him. She makes a wrong turn and finds herself going the wrong way into traffic on a wide heavily trafficked street. There follows one minute of her frantically dodging cars at the last moment. Very funny. Ha, ha, ha.This movie could have been a fairly good romantic thriller if they had fixed the plot and not tried to be a comedy. But the dumb plot and the unfunny attempts at comedy make it a complete waste of time.Rennie Petersen",2,Too dumb to be funny,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,2425,"['Legal', 'Eagles', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'find', 'characters', 'played', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'be', 'amusing', 'acrimonious', 'relationship', 'be', 'hilarious', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'partners', 'gibes', 'be', 'romantically', 'satisfying.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'too', 'dumb', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'thus', 'too', 'dumb', 'be', 'funny.Briefly', 'story', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'assistant', 'District', 'Attorney', 'be', 'promoted', 'be', 'DA', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'young', 'woman', 'emotional', 'problems', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'client', 'plot', 'fire', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'was', 'eight', 'fire', 'killed', 'artist', 'father', 'purportedly', 'destroyed', 'large', 'number', 'paintings', 'experience', 'left', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'traumatized', 'not', 'now', '20', 'years', 'later', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'first', 'accused', 'attempted', 'theft', 'later', 'murder.Unfortunately', 'plot', 'many', 'elements', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'good', 'job', 'listing', 'four', 'different', 'major', 'things', 'make', 'plot', 'completely', 'unbelievable.As', 'well', 'story', 'being', 'dumb', 'found', 'scenes', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'be', 'anything', 'but.For', 'example', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'weekend', 'father', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'one', 'point', 'ex-wife', 'threatens', 'go', 'court', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'daughter', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'telephone', 'call', 'ex-wife', 'home', 'angry', 'monologue', 'threats', 'how', ""'ll"", 'take', 'apart', 'court', 'Then', 'actually', 'talking', 'daughter', 'mistake', 'apparently', 'supposed', 'be', 'hilarious', 'Ha', 'scene', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'are', 'together', 'see', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'off', 'foot', 'try', 'catch', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'drive', 'car', 'necessary', 'jump', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'car', 'try', 'follow', 'wrong', 'turn', 'going', 'wrong', 'way', 'traffic', 'wide', 'heavily', 'trafficked', 'street', 'one', 'minute', 'frantically', 'dodging', 'cars', 'last', 'moment', 'Very', 'funny', 'Ha', 'ha', 'ha.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'good', 'romantic', 'thriller', 'had', 'fixed', 'plot', 'not', 'tried', 'be', 'comedy', 'dumb', 'plot', 'unfunny', 'attempts', 'comedy', 'make', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.Rennie', 'Petersen']",N/A

The overloaded plot revolves around an assistant D.A. who gets involved with a defense lawyer to solve a convoluted case that includes arson, art robbery, insurance fraud, even murder.It's almost as if the plot was not the point. The 22-carat charisma of Robert Redford and the starry-eyed charm of Debra Winger is what keeps the film afloat with some delicious chemistry. Daryl Hannah is very effective as the spaced-out daughter, who spends most of the movie seeming sexy and/or guilty.The whole mishmash ends up significantly less than the sum of its parts, which is sad because with only slightly better editing it stood on the brink of being an excellent film.
