883161,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0007N1A36,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 0]","Is there an unwritten rule in Hollywood that if you choose to recreate comedy, it has to be less funny than the original so that it doesn't overpower the genuine moment of the first?  I am a strong believer that there is such a rule because I fully witnessed it in the film Fat Albert.  This film had so much potential that I really wanted to jump into my television and start grabbing necks a-la Homer Simpson.  Frustration grew inside of me as jokes were tossed out towards the viewing audience with such disappointment that to laugh would have given the film way too much credit.  The characters were flat, the story was ""normal chaos that has been done in nearly every other film"", and the class of the television program Fat Albert was diminished by cheap thrills and over-budgeting.  Did Bill Cosby have a true writing credit to this film?  It would be hard for me to believe that he seriously considered this work great, but then again, he is older and has bills to pay ... so why not?  While the ending tried to bring a tear to your eye, I was already crying at the utter lack of appreciation that this film carried and influenced the youth of our nation.To say that this film was horrible would be too kind of a word, to quote a line from the film ""(Fat Albert is) like school on Saturday: no class"" would again, probably be giving it too much credit.  From the opening credit sequence to the overly animated cartoons to the lack of animation in the characters when they became real was difficult to watch. Kenan Thompson tries really hard to empower the soul of Fat Albert, but what comes through the screen are just pathetic.  He has no backbone and literally, he gives Albert this image of ignorance.  Instead of being this helpful friend, Thompson's Albert has these huge glazed eyes that roll around whenever trouble begins.  He just didn't seem to have that pizzazz that I remember Albert having from the television programs.  If Albert was a leader in the cartoon, he was not one in this film.  Unless you count the fact that the other actors in this film followed his suit by also leaving their energy at home.  Childish humor coupled with this sense of apathy really didn't spark this film onto the level it should have been.  I kept seeing glances of this really humorous story about Fat Albert in the real world, but instead I was forced through yet another Cool World.  That is how I would best describe this film, Cool World for children.With our characters firmly not caring about their careers, we are then forced to focus on the non-existent story that apparently the writers of this film chose to not write.  Instead of creating a plot with some climactic moments, our writers of this film chose to just let Fat Albert wander until something funny happened.  I kept wondering to myself if this was an actual scripted film or just Thompson and Zwick allowing improv to occur anywhere and anytime.  Now, if you were working with a genuine comic actor this could have worked (like Robin Williams or Will Ferrell), but with Thompson it just felt forced.  Nearly every scene felt forced or overworked in this film.  Spontaneity was not an element that these writers considered.  This ultimately caused the jokes to be extremely flat.  The humor just didn't bring the true life of Albert onto the screen.  This is where I question the validity of Cosby being involved with this production.  I know he was getting paid, but how much did he work?  The jokes felt so old and used that I am surprised that children responded to them.  Maybe it was the urban feel that Albert somehow felt comfortable in ... who knows?  Either way, the loose story allowed for unfizzy jokes, which ultimately lead to the demise of this picture.Finally, I would like to say that Fat Albert (when I was growing up) was an inspiration and ""every man"" to us all.  The group that followed him and his actions somehow always felt like a part of us.  There wasn't anything that could stop Fat Albert from helping another lost soul, and somehow in this film adaptation, none of these old feels could be remembered.  It wasn't as if they were trying, but this was definitely not the same Fat Albert that I grew up with.  He didn't reach me like he used to, and perhaps it was the larger budget or the lack of imagination, but Albert hurt the soul in this film.  I am surprised that he was able to assist Doris in her problem (this obscure problem that was never quite defined), because if I were in her shoes, I would have politely kicked this Albert to the curb.  Cosby needed to reconsider his options before allowing this Albert to see the light of day.Overall, as if you couldn't tell already, this film hurt me.  As I watched this dopey picture, I couldn't help but wonder if this film was focused correctly.  When it first started I had this feeling that Albert would be called to help Doris with her problem, causing him to be a secondary character (like her own Jiminie Cricket), but instead what happened is that Thompson's camera excitement stole the performance away from Doris while creating a film centered around Albert.  This should not have been the case for this to be a truly inspirational film.  We lost the central focus of the film, and then the story just went fuzzy.  Too many hands in the honey pot with one hand wanting to be on top.  It was sad, and ultimately destroyed this film.Grade: ** out of *****",2,You're like school on Saturday: no class.,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,5418,"['unwritten', 'rule', 'Hollywood', 'choose',

Before this film,the memories inspired the Saturday morning cartoon show that ran on CBS from 1972 to 1984. Logically,director Joel Zwick took responsibility for Nia Vardalos' personally scripted 2002 blockbuster MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING.  Keenan Thompson plays the title character,who at first does not look too overweight. Kyla Pratt plays Thompson's girlfriend. Cosby even has a supporting role in the film as himself(according to the end credits). Cosby served as executive producer along with his wife of 41 years,the former Camille Olivia Hanks. In several scenes,Fat Albert and his friends are seen at their high school even at a nightclub. There are also a few scenes where when the TV is turned on,Fat Albert in animated form(the CBS show) is seen. Cosby's Cosby Show co-star Raven Symone even has a bit role in the film. Currently RS is the star of Disney's THAT'S SO RAVEN. If only Phylicia Rashad had a role in the film,that would have been awesome. Rashad co-starred with Cosby on TCS and CBS's COSBY. They also did Nick Jr.'s Little Bill cartoons(also created by Cosby) together. It was only last Christmas Day that this film was theatrically released.

I also remember getting a little tired of Bill Cosby doing everybody's voice. In Fat Albert the movie, of course there was none of that, and the Bill Cosby cameo was hilarious and touching at the same time.I liked the way the movie played around with the fact that these were TV characters; it added a surreal element to the movie.  I also thought it was funny the way the characters remained very 70s, kind of like in the Brady Bunch movie, but the spirit in this movie was a lot sweeter.This was a movie you could watch with your children, pausing from time to time to tell them about a character you remembered from childhood.

Little did I know when I went to see the film this past Christmas I would actually enjoy it. The movie starts out almost promising enough- with a Fat Albert cartoon. Only it's animated with current technology, and has the obligatory CG in it, since all cartoons these days need CG. Fat Albert and the Junk Yard Kids are playing a game of Buck Buck with the rival kids. Cut to the main character- Doris, a girl in highschool who isn't invited to a party. And it's understandable with a name like that. She goes home and watches Fat Albert, still crying over not getting invited, and one of her tears hits the remote. Somehow, this sends the tear into the TV, where Fat Albert and the gang sees it. Albert sees Doris is upset, and...jumps out of the TV to help her out. The gang follows, and Doris is left wondering what the heck just happened. She says that she's sad because she can't find her backpack. They see it on the couch, and she thanks them and tries to get them to go back into the TV. But, the show's over, and they can't. Yes, they realize they're cartoon characters, which is actually a good touch on the writers' part. I'm sick of movies where they don't understand that they're not ""real"". But, she's stuck with them until the show's on again, which isn't until the next day at 2:30. They follow her around town, where they find out that she's sad because she doesn't have any friends. When they follow her to school, they make sure to say this in front of the whole class, and tell people to be her friend. This happens a few more times, and keeps embarrassing her. Fat Albert starts to get puppy love for Doris' foster sister (who is a lot like Shannon Elizabeth- she looks decent, but talks awkwardly and can't act). A guy who has a crush on her from school, played poorly by *sigh* Omarion, doesn't like this, and tries to one-up Albert from time to time, failing miserably. Along the way, not much happens, and I think we all know how much Albert will want to go home after getting Doris' sister to like him.Yes, the plot is predictable, but it's also pretty boring. Don't get me wrong, I tried to like this movie and accept the charm from the characters. But it just wasn't there. The only Junk Yard Kids that do anything are Mushmouth and Dumb Donald. I swear, Bill served no purpose aside from completing the gang. Old Weird Harold had his moments, but never did much else when they were over. Bucky was there to look creepy (he looks like Dave Chappelle fused with Beetlejuice from Howard Stern), and I honest to god don't remember Rudy doing anything important. Yeah, I know the title of the movie is Fat Albert, but why include the gang if you're not going to use them equally, if at all? And the ""problems"" Doris faces aren't anything big. We don't find out what her real problem is until later on, and I don't get how someone as good looking as Kyla Pratt could have self-esteem issues. Either way, it was a chore for me to sit through the whole movie. You know things are bad when you think it's almost over, then check the time to see that it's only 15 minutes into the movie. A lot of the acting was terrible as well. Kyla and Kenan were the only ones that gave any effort. Omarion was horrendous, giving weird facial expressions I haven't seen since this one koala ran head-first into a parked jeep on Animal Planet. But, while Kenan did look just like Fat Albert, his voice could've used work. Some scenes had him talking like Albert, others had him talking like Kenan. And what was with all the cameos?

This ""continuation"" of the classic 1970's Bill Cosby-created cartoon is actually not half bad. First, the casting of the gang are pretty much spot-on, with Kenan ""SNL"" Thompson heading-up as Albert. The rest of the cast features young black actors most of us saw while changing channels on the likes of UPN, the WB, and the like. It seems in cartoon-land, the characters do each episode every time exactly the same until one day a young girl crying over her remote creates a porthole into Fat Albert's world while watching the re-run. He and gang, always looking to help whoever needs it, goes through, and boom, there they are. The storyline isn't complex, but towards the end when Albert looks up ole Cosby himself to try to figure out what to do, it pays off in the end as to why he ended up there in the first place, and actually is sorta touching in the process. Not kidding, really.But that's not to say the film doesn't have it's own set of flaws. The animation is updated losing alot of it's Filmation charm. Even with a 2.35.1 widescreen, they had no room for Russell (the littlest one, Bill's brother), Kenan while able to do the ""Hey, Hey, Hey"" bit well, can't sing his way outta a paper bag, the ""Mushmouth"" accent is done horribly here, and finally, the coolest character ""Rudy"" dressed like a pimp with sarcasm dripping in the cartoon, seems too nice now and needed to stand out more instead of being like all the rest.But I've seen alot of my childhood shows brought back with mixed results, but unlike say ""The Brady Bunch"" who didn't realize that they were stuck in the 70's, ""Fat Albert"" knows it, and knows why they have to go back.

It's a bit goofy, but I have watched it a few times, and quite like it.Doris (Kyla Pratt) is a Philadelphia teenager with a problem. Well, that's what Fat Albert and his friends think when they come out of the TV, thanks to her tears falling on her remote. She doesn't have many friends, she doesn't get invited to parties, and she's not too good at sports. Fat Albert and the gang, now in the real world, are determined to solve Doris' problems, and follow her to school. Doris is humiliated, having brightly dressed cartoon characters tagging along everywhere she goes, but she'll have to put up with it for a while, the Fat Albert gang can only go back in the TV when their show is on, and that isn't for another day! While their in the real world, Fat Albert falls in love, Mushmouth has a go at rapping, Weird Harold plays basketball, and Dumb Donald learns to read. The real world is a very exciting place, and they get carried away in their new pursuits. Will they get back in the TV before they fade away? Will they solve Doris' problem? And apart from being a cartoon character, why does Fat Albert seem so familiar to Doris?It's a very colourful film, being a real-life adaption of a cartoon. Also, being a modern remake of an older show, there are a lot of digs at how time has changed (wondering how a can of soft drink works, etc) and the limitations of the characters (Dumb Donald can't take off his hat, and Fat Albert can't take off his red shirt, because there might not be anything there, for instance). There is some banter for the show as well, which is nice. There are a few cameo appearances too, by Bill Cosby (""Who is it?"" ""Fat Albert!"" ""Yeah, RIGHT!""), Russel Cosby (in one of the last scenes) and even Aaron Carter, as a student in Doris' class.It's silly fun for the family, and worth a look for Bill Cosby fans.",4,"""Gonna Have A Good Time""",1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,1971,"['Fat', 'Albert', 'live-action', 'remake', '1970s', 'animated', 'series', 'inspired', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'new', 'animated', 'footage', 'thrown', 'bit', 'goofy', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'quite', 'like', 'it.Doris', 'Kyla', 'Pratt', 'Philadelphia', 'teenager', 'problem', 'Well', 'what', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'friends', 'think', 'when', 'come', 'TV', 'thanks', 'tears', 'falling', 'remote', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'friends', ""n't"", 'get', 'invited', 'parties', 'not', 'too', 'good', 'sports', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'gang', 'now', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'determined', 'solve', 'Doris', 'problems', 'follow', 'school', 'Doris', 'humiliated', 'having', 'brightly', 'dressed', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'tagging', 'along', 'everywhere', ""'ll"", 'have', 'put', 'up', 'while', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'gang', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'back', 'TV', 'when', 'show', ""n't"", 'day', 'real', 'world', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'love', 'Mushmouth', 'go', 'rapping', 'Weird', 'Harold', 'basketball', 'Dumb', 'Donald', 'read', 'real', 'world', 'very', 'exciting', 'place', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'new', 'pursuits', 'Will', 'get', 'back', 'TV', 'fade', 'away', 'Will', 'solve', 'Doris', 'problem', 'apart', 'being', 'cartoon', 'character', 'why', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'seem', 'so', 'familiar', 'Doris', 'very', 'colourful', 'film', 'being', 'real-life', 'adaption', 'cartoon', 'Also', 'being', 'modern', 'remake', 'older', 'show', 'are', 'lot', 'digs', 'how', 'time', 'changed', 'wondering', 'how', 'can', 'soft', 'drink', 'works', 'etc', 'limitations', 'characters', 'Dumb', 'Donald', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'hat', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'red', 'shirt', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'there', 'instance', 'banter', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'are', 'few', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'too', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Who', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'Yeah', 'RIGHT', 'Russel', 'Cosby', 'one', 'last', 'scenes', 'even', 'Aaron', 'Carter', 'student', 'Doris', 'class.It', 'silly', 'fun', 'family', 'look', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'fans']",N/A

I was hoping this movie wouldn't be a lame re-invention like Scooby-Doo (as an example).Both my husband and I were pleasantly suprised! We laughed our butts off throughout the movie; it was hilarious to see ""Fat Albert"" and the gang doing a modern, hip-hop version of ""Gonna Have a Good Time (Hey, Hey, Hey!)"".The plot is sweet, but it's not saccharine. There's enough clever humor and sight gags to please adults, as well as the kids (especially if you're familiar with the gang). One of my favorite parts is when Fat Albert and the guys pass a video shop. They see that they're coming out on ""DIV-i-der"" (the phonetic pronunciation of DVD. It's a lot funnier to see it...) Seeing what happens when cartoons from the 70's come to life in the modern world brings some very hilarious moments, to be sure!Some interesting mysteries pop up, too: Does Dumb Donald have a face under that pink cap? Will Mush Mouth be relegated to mumbling through every conversation in ""the real world""?The most touching part of the DVD is the very end.

""A New Yorker""","[0, 0]","Bill's script keeps the spirit of the original characters intact, and incorporates them into the real world without an overkill of ""Oh, wow! Things are so different now!"" style of jokes. This movie is made for kids, not at kids. Things are kept simple without being condescending, and at no time will adults have to talk their way out of explaining something ""Adult"" to the kiddies.""Fat Albert"" stands above most of what I have seen with my kids lately. Beside a wonderful dose of nostalgia for boomers, this is a movie packed with humor, solid entertainment, decency, and important lessons about life. To me, that's what children's entertainment is about.And there were bonuses for adults as well...I thought the cast succeeded in capturing what we loved about the cartoon characters. Dumb Donald, Mush Mouth, Fat Albert were all on target and delivered more to love in their human form.I also appreciated the movie's ability to laugh at itself. I cracked up when The Cosby Kids were waiting outside the girl's apartment the morning after they met. They didn't need to sleep, eat, or go to the bathroom...because Hey! Hey! Hey!, they're cartoon characters.Lastly, the connection to the girl's grandfather Al was a lovely tie-in and the scene at the cemetery where the grown up Cosby gang paid tribute to their friend was sentimental without being sappy.Can I pick apart small things about the movie? Absolutely! However, this movie provided my family and myself with such good feelings, smiles, and conversation afterwards that there is no need to bother.Compare this with other kids movies that are chock full of scatological humor and impending sexuality and you will see that ""Fat Albert"" stands far and above.

883185,A2BRSYSJO4L7VV,B0007N1A36,"Ken ""KC Music Fan""","[1, 2]","I have a lot of classic Bill Cosby comedy records, and when Bill's Fat Albert cartoon ran on Saturday mornings in the early '70s, I was a big fan.  The show, featuring Fat Albert, Russell, Weird Harold, Rudy, Mushmouth, Dumb Donald, and the other characters from Bill's comedy routines, was fun, and at the same time, Bill used the episodes to teach important things about life--for instance, how to deal with family problems.  I wasn't sure how I'd like the movie adaptation of the classic series, but after checking out the DVD of Fat Albert, I think the movie is great.  The movie, with Kenan Thompson in the title role and Bill playing himself, doesn't have the same serious ""edge"" as the series, but it's very entertaining and uplifting.The movie opens with Doris, the protagonist(played by Kyla Pratt), crying because she is lonely.  While Doris is watching her favorite program, a rerun of the Fat Albert TV show, one of her tears falls onto the TV remote control, causing Fat Albert and his buddies to come out of the TV screen and into her living room.  The sequence where Fat Albert literally has to squeeze through Doris' TV screen is one of the funniest in the movie.  When Albert, whom I remember as the problem-solver in Bill Cosby's original program, says he is there to help, Doris denies that she has a problem.  However, Albert and his buddies tag along with Doris and make it their mission to help her make some friends.  The problem Albert and his friends run up against is that they have to make Doris happy and then get back into their cartoon universe the next time their TV program comes around, or they will turn into dust.  Also, Doris, a member of her school's track team, needs a date for the big dance at the same time she is getting ready for a track meet.  The gang follows Doris to her usual hangouts--her school, the mall, the school's outdoor track, the fair--and they have a lot of comic adventures as their bodies are fading.  Albert has become attracted to Doris' sister Laurie(Dania Ramirez), and he becomes the latter's date for the big dance, which Doris also attends.  The dance scene, with its hip-hop version of the Fat Albert theme song, is fun and well-done.  One of the gang's first attempts to get back home is thwarted the day after they've all been to the big dance.  After the gang comes home from the park, their cartoon is interrupted by a special news broadcast, leaving Albert, Rudy, Mushmouth, and the young Bill Cosby stranded in the real world.  To go on, Donald starts reading; Mushmouth, who always speaks in unintelligible babbles, is able to speak clearly; normally clumsy Harold becomes a basketball star; and the porky Albert beats Reggie, Doris' jealous classmate, in a race.  At the same time, back in the cartoon universe, the young Bill Cosby's brother Russell is trying to fend off the junkyard bullies by himself.Though I don't want to give away the plot completely, in the real world, Fat Albert and the gang learn the source of Doris' discontent.  Besides preparing for a track meet and having trouble making friends, Doris is grieving over her grandfather's death.  Albert, having been a cartoon character and a ""Mr. Fix-It"" type, is confused about what to do--and this is where Bill Cosby, his creator, comes in.  In addition to warning Albert that he(Albert) is a cartoon that will turn into dust, Bill Cosby tells Albert something about how his(Albert's) character was created--more information than we get in the movie's extras.  Bill tells Fat Albert about Doris' grandfather, Albert Robertson, and we learn that Albert Robertson was the inspiration for the Fat Albert character.  The ending is predictable but funny.  After Fat Albert and his buddies have been to the fair, and after Albert himself bids Laurie an emotional goodbye, the gang races back to Doris' apartment just as their program is coming to a close.  By this time their colors have almost completely faded out.  With the exception of Albert, they jump back into the TV screen.  As his buddies shout at him from Doris' TV screen, Fat Albert tells them that he is staying longer because, in his words, ""It's time for Doris to believe in herself again.""  Of course, Doris and her relay team win their event at the track meet, with Albert cheering them on.  Thanks to some nifty skateboard action, Albert and Doris escape some of Doris' wisecracking fellow students, including Reggie, and Albert gets back to Doris' apartment and into her TV set while his show is still on.  After going back into his cartoon universe, Albert shows up at the junkyard and helps his buddies defeat the bad guys.  The ending features Bill himself, along with the cast in costume, at Albert Robertson's grave.Though I like Fat Albert's story line and its humor, there are some problems with the film.  For instance, we don't know one of the key reasons for Doris' unhappiness and her trouble making friends, her grandfather's death, until later on in the movie.  In the TV show which inspired the movie, Bill Cosby always tried to let us know clearly at the beginning of the show what the episode was about.  To their credit, Kenan, the star, and Joel Zwick, the director, wanted to bring the series' comic appeal to the big screen, and they do a convincing job of it.  Besides the funny elements I've already mentioned, Fat Albert's culture gap provides another humorous subplot--Albert and his buddies, stuck in the '70s, don't know anything about compact discs, home computers, cell phones, DVDs, or our other modern tech wonders, and Albert is surprised to see himself on a poster advertising a collection of classic Fat Albert episodes on DVD.  Also, though the movie's scenery was well-done, I think Joel made it look too cartoonish.  The scenery was inspired by the Fat Albert TV show, but in my opinion, it's a caricature of how Doris, the working-class heroine, would actually live and how Bill himself lived.  It sounds too neat and tidy for me.  Ironically, Russell's cartoon environment, with the junkyard full of old cars and auto parts, is more convincing and realistic.  Finally, the DVD doesn't have a lot of bonus material other than a running comentary by Joel and producer John Davis and a ""Behind The Band"" video showing how Fat Albert and the Junkyard Band came to be.  I would have liked to see Bill Cosby himself talk about how the Fat Albert character was created.  Still, I think Fat Albert, the movie, is a great update of Bill Cosby's classic cartoon.  It's funny, and it also tells an uplifting story about making friends, having a good time, and believing in yourself.",4,Great adaptation of Bill Cosby's classic cartoon,1113091200,"04 10,

883188,A2IHZZLM3F2VYG,B0007N1A36,Larry Shepherd,"[0, 1]","I wasn't too sure if I'd enjoy this remake of the 70's cartoon classic, since it seems like every show from the 60's, 70's & 80's has been remade in one way or another.  Some of the remakes have been okay, while others have been just plain awful.In this case, the remake was very good.  The characters were very similar to the original characters, almost identical.  The movie starts with a little girl watching Fat Albert & The Gang on television in one of their many animated shows.  As usual, Fat Albert is trying to help someone with a problem.  Suddenly, he sees a little girl crying.  It is the little girl watching the Fat Albert show on her television.  All of a sudden, Fat Albert himself comes through the television set and straight into her living room.  She can't believe her eyes.  Soon after, the rest of the gang follow Fat Albert into the real world.  Fat Albert discovers the girl is crying because she has no friends.  So they set out to help her make friends, trying not to embarrass her too much along the way.The storyline is excellent.  Fat Albert is very likable in this movie, as his relationship with Laurie, attests to.  Laurie, is the very attractive older sister of the little crying girl.  I can't remember her name, sorry.  Anyway, Laurie is attracted to Fat Albert, much to the chagrin of Omarion's character, who wants to go out with Laurie.

She found out she wasn't invented to the big party that her sister Lauri was invented to. So, Doris comes home to watch her favorite TV show, ""Fat Albert"". She was crying, and a teardrop fell into the remote control, making a portal into Doris's room. Fat Albert and the gang go right through the portal because she was crying, and Fat Albert is all about solving problems. And now, Fat Albert learns to adapt to the ""real world"". Everyone thinks Fat Albert and his friends are ""weirdos"". Doris tells Fat Albert and his friends that she doesn't have a problem, but Doris has them follow along anyway. Doris brings them to school, making Doris feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. That is where Albert meets Lauri, and Albert thinks she was cute. Laura's boyfriends notices this, and makes many attempts so Laura doesn't like Albert back, but he fails completely. Then, Albert finds Bill Cosby. Bill says that if he doesn't go back into the TV, he will turn into dust.Will Albert stay with his love Lauri and turn into dust, or will he go back into the TV?Pros -This movie actually made me giggle a few times. Not laugh, but I did do some light giggling, mostly when Albert and his friends are just arriving into the real world, wondering what a bra is and what a phone is. I found the characters to be delightful, and funny (read above). And how unique each individual character is. The climax question may be a little dull, considering yes, there are a lot of similar movies. But it's the fact that the question is presented in a different way. It's good that this movie comes with optional widescreen and fullscreen. Though, I'm not going to talk much about that, because some of you don't even have a DVD player.Cons -One thing that you will notice, just from reading the plot, that characters are flying everywhere. You'll notice every ten minutes, there will be a new character introduced. It's very hard to understand when a movie is like this because it leaves out some of their qualities. Sometimes, I didn't even get the character's name. Another thing, is the fact that it's rated PG. It does feature some moments that (or as I think) shouldn't be suitable for childern. Like the bra scene that I giggled about, when one of Albert's friends (once again character development problems) was looking at a undershirt, which had breasts cups on it, and other people shopping were starring at it. Ok, some people think it's kinda funny, and others may think it's downright wrong, but we all have to agree that this is not good for childern. Other scenes have this same problem. One little thing, it just kind of bothers me that at the beginning of the movie, they show a minute clip about piracy. I don't do any piracy at all, I just found this to be quite distracting, and a little rude. I think it was enough to put two things about it on the DVD case. I know piracy is wrong, but a minute clip before the film is too much. Do you listen to a CD and track 1 is about piracy? Didn't think so. Though, that just a very minor con, and it doesn't bother me, just disracting.BOTTOMLINE: ""Fat Albert"" is a heart-warming and funny family film.

883203,AO19QQOF7E2SX,B0007N1A36,roger,"[2, 3]","Now here is a movie for which the words ""good-hearted"" come straight into mind. It takes the characters of Bill Cosby's ""Fat Albert"" TV cartoon show from the 1970s, and sends them popping magically out of the TV screen and into the life of a teenage girl -- where, hey-hey-hey, they give her advice that has always worked for them in Toonland. It's ingenious in the way it shows the cartoon characters amazed by the real world (hey-hey-hey, they learn from a poster in a video store that they're on a ""de-ved,"" or however you say ""DVD""). But in a season where the standards have been set for animated entertainment by ""The Polar Express"" and ""The Incredibles,"" I don't think ""Fat Albert"" is up to speed; in its meandering, low-key way, it seems destined more for a future on de-ved, returning to the video world where the characters say they feel more at home.Kyla Pratt plays Doris, a high school student who is pretty and smart but lacks self-confidence and feels left out of things. There's a big party tonight (a rich kid's father is blocking off the street) but she's not invited. Oh, she was kinda included in an invitation to her popular foster sister Lauri (Dania Ramirez), but that's not the same thing.Doris comes home, turns on the TV and sheds a single tear, which falls onto the TV screen and creates a portal in space, time and reality. On the ""Fat Albert"" TV show, in a Philadelphia junkyard, the characters see this glistening sphere floating in mid-air, take a reckless chance by jumping through it, and find themselves in Doris' living room.Many movies have inserted cartoon characters into the real world, but usually while still representing them as cartoons, as in ""Roger Rabbit,"" ""Space Jam"" and ""Garfield."" In ""Fat Albert,"" the toons become real humans, played by actors who look amazingly like their TV counterparts, including Kenan Thompson of ""Saturday Night Live,"" who wears a padded costume that makes him look not like an actual fat kid, but like a cartoon fat kid who is round in all the right places and has a belt around the equator that looks drawn on. (In a poignant sequence at the very end of the film, we discover that the toons also look like Bill Cosby's real-life childhood friends, who inspired ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids."")Doris, who is worried about her popularity, isn't thrilled to be joined by cartoonish caricatures like Fat Albert, Mushmouth (Jermaine Williams), Bucky (Alphonso McAuley), Old Weird Harold (Aaron A. Frazier), Dumb Donald (Marques B. Houston) and Rudy (Shedrack Anderson III). Nor are they exactly thrilled to be in the real world, where things work differently than in a cartoon. They try to jump back into the screen, but the ""Fat Albert"" show is over, and they deduce that the magic portal opens only while they're on the air; that means they have to stick around for 24 hours. Alas, the bright colors of their costumes seem to be slowly fading away, as if they're losing their unreality.There's an awkward little subplot in which Fat Albert gets a crush on Lauri, a strange moment when Dumb Donald reveals that he wears a hood ""because I haven't got a face,"" and lots of scenes in which Doris' low self-esteem is boosted by the Cosby Kids' hey-hey-hey style of positive thinking.The movie is sweet and gentle, but not very compelling. All but its younger viewers will be expecting a little more excitement along with Fat Albert's genial encouragement of Doris.And I was wondering, as I always do with plot devices like this, why the human characters deal so calmly with the appearance of toons. Yes, Doris is surprised when the Fat Albert gang pops through her TV set, but isn't that event more than just ... surprising? Isn't it incredibly amazing?

They must, for how else can one explain the existence of this live-action, big-screen version of a 1970's cartoon series that very few of the people who are the target audience have ever even heard of, let alone remember fondly?  Did studio execs really think there was a huge ""Fat Albert"" fan base out there clamoring for this movie to be made?The premise of this ""Fat Albert"" seems designed to cater to all those pre-teens out there with postmodernist tendencies.  Through some sort of unexplained fluke of magic, Fat Albert and his ""gang"" leap out of a TV screen to come to the aid of a young girl who is having trouble fitting in with the kids at school.  As is his wont, Fat Albert - whose guttural ""hey...hey...hey..."" became his official character trademark - dispenses chicken soup sentiment and fortune cookie wisdom as he goes about the business of solving everyone`s problems.Bill Cosby, who was the creator of the original ""Fat Albert,"" has co-written (along with Charles Kipps) a screenplay that is so well-intentioned, so inoffensive and so white-bread bland in its attitude and demeanor that the movie seems to be evaporating even as you're watching it (much as the kids gradually fade away - though it is strangely imperceptible to the viewer - as their time in the real world runs out).  Although the film is supposed to be about what happens when these two-dimensional cartoon characters from the 1970's are suddenly confronted with the three-dimensional realities of the early 21st Century, the Philadelphia that is shown to us in the movie - an obvious studio backlot if ever there was one - is so squeaky-clean and homogenized in appearance that the film might as well be a cartoon itself.  Thus, the comic tension that should be derived from that juxtaposition of two vastly different worlds never materializes, and we sit in backside-numbing soreness waiting for the movie to end.Keenan Thompson (from ""SNL"") brings a certain amount of sweetness and energy to the title character, but the screenwriters and director Joel Zwick have given him zero material of quality to work with.  ""Fat Albert"" may be fine for undiscriminating and undemanding preschool audiences - though most of them probably won`t have any real familiarity with or affection for the original reference point - but it is far too juvenile to be of any interest to the people who grew up watching it on TV.",1,a soulless exercise in nostalgia,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,2431,"['*1/2Do', 'studios', 'have', 'death', 'wish', 'must', 'how', 'else', 'can', 'one', 'explain', 'existence', 'live-action', 'big-screen', 'version', '1970', 'cartoon', 'series', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'target', 'audience', 'have', 'ever', 'even', 'heard', 'let', 'alone', 'remember', 'fondly', 'Did', 'studio', 'execs', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'huge', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'fan', 'base', 'there', 'clamoring', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'premise', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'designed', 'cater', 'pre-teens', 'out', 'there', 'postmodernist', 'tendencies', 'sort', 'unexplained', 'fluke', 'magic', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'gang', 'TV', 'screen', 'come', 'aid', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'having', 'trouble', 'fitting', 'kids', 'school', 'wont', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'guttural', 'hey', 'hey', 'hey', 'became', 'official', 'character', 'trademark', 'chicken', 'soup', 'sentiment', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'wisdom', 'business', 'solving', 'everyone', 's', 'problems.Bill', 'Cosby', 'who', 'was', 'creator', 'original', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'co-written', 'Charles', 'Kipps', 'screenplay', 'so', 'well-intentioned', 'so', 'inoffensive', 'so', 'white-bread', 'bland', 'attitude', 'demeanor', 'movie', 'be', 'evaporating', 'even', ""'re"", 'watching', 'much', 'kids', 'gradually', 'fade', 'away', 'strangely', 'imperceptible', 'viewer', 'time', 'real', 'world', 'out', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'what', 'when', 'two-dimensional', 'cartoon', 'characters', '1970', 'are', 'suddenly', 'confronted', 'three-dimensional', 'realities', 'early', '21st', 'Century', 'Philadelphia', 'shown', 'movie', 'obvious', 'studio', 'backlot', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'so', 'squeaky-clean', 'homogenized', 'appearance', 'film', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'cartoon', 'Thus', 'comic', 'tension', 'should', 'be', 'derived', 'juxtaposition', 'two', 'vastly', 'different', 'worlds', 'never', 'materializes', 'sit', 'backside-numbing', 'soreness', 'waiting', 'movie', 'end.Keenan', 'Thompson', 'SNL', 'certain', 'amount', 'sweetness', 'energy', 'title', 'character', 'screenwriters', 'director', 'Joel', 'Zwick', 'have', 'given', 'zero', 'material', 'quality', 'work', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'undiscriminating', 'undemanding', 'preschool', 'audiences', 'most', 'probably', 'won', 't', 'have', 'real', 'familiarity', 'affection', 'original', 'reference', 'point', 'far', 'too', 'juvenile', 'be', 'interest', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'TV']",N/A

For the life of me, I cannot understand how anybody could find a tragic film about a young mans fight against obesity could have humorous value! These people are the same people who laughed about the ""Ive fallen and I can't get up!"" old woman. PEOPLE- HARDSHIPS ARE NOT HUMOR. CHILDHOOD OBESITY SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTYLY!!That said, I havent seen the movie, but I hear its a real knee slapper. I mean HELLO! Kenan Thompson can do no wrong! I mean, have you seen GOOD BURGER?!?!Good Burger is based on a skit from the TV series All That on Nickelodeon. The story follows Ed, an employee of Good Burger, home of the Good Burger. They are under serious competition from Mondo Burger (which looks like a giant palace with billions of neon lights, don't ask!!!). The employees at Good Burger have to defend themselves from the chain's onslaught by introducing Ed's recipe for a ""secret sauce"". ENTER COMEDY GOLD!!!!So what is there for parents to be concerned about... countless crotch and flatulence jokes and a steady stream of profanity like the pathetic George of the Jungle? You won't find that here, no sir!! Abe Vigoda says the ""a"" word once to describe his injured buttocks. ""S*cks"" is also used twice. There is NO other crude language and there is no profanity, the Lord's name in vain or obsceneties. Carmen Electra's character, Roxanne, tries to seduce Ed but he fends her off.And unlike George, this movie has a few redeeming qualities. As funny as this movie is, it's still grounded in reality. Dexter's dad is a deadbeat and they (Ed and he) discuss the sadness of having no friends. Cheating is put down, the work ethic is encouraged, and the actors aren't bad role models.On a side note, actors Kenan (19) and Kel (18) both grew up in the church. (Kel is from Chicago and Kenan is from Atlanta). They both have strong relationships with their mothers (as can be learned from the July 26th-August 1st issue of TV Guide, which I adore :-) ).So do yourself a favor and order a large portion of delicious Good Burger while its still available!",1,Disappointed with America,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2151,"['read', 'reviews', 'film', 'found', 'shock', 'How', 'far', 'fallen', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'anybody', 'could', 'find', 'tragic', 'film', 'young', 'mans', 'fight', 'obesity', 'could', 'have', 'humorous', 'value', 'people', 'are', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'laughed', 'Ive', 'fallen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'old', 'woman', 'PEOPLE-', 'HARDSHIPS', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'HUMOR', 'CHILDHOOD', 'OBESITY', 'SHOULD', 'NOT', 'BE', 'TAKEN', 'LIGHTYLY', 'said', 'havent', 'seen', 'movie', 'hear', 'real', 'knee', 'slapper', 'mean', 'HELLO', 'Kenan', 'Thompson', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'mean', 'have', 'seen', 'GOOD', 'BURGER', 'Good', 'Burger', 'based', 'skit', 'TV', 'series', 'All', 'Nickelodeon', 'story', 'Ed', 'employee', 'Good', 'Burger', 'home', 'Good', 'Burger', 'are', 'serious', 'competition', 'Mondo', 'Burger', 'giant', 'palace', 'billions', 'neon', 'lights', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'employees', 'Good', 'Burger', 'have', 'defend', 'chain', 'onslaught', 'introducing', 'Ed', 'recipe', 'secret', 'sauce', 'ENTER', 'COMEDY', 'GOLD', 'what', 'there', 'parents', 'be', 'concerned', 'countless', 'crotch', 'flatulence', 'jokes', 'steady', 'stream', 'profanity', 'pathetic', 'George', 'Jungle', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'sir', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'word', 'once', 'describe', 'injured', 'buttocks', 'S*cks', 'also', 'used', 'twice', 'other', 'crude', 'language', 'profanity', 'Lord', 'name', 'vain', 'obsceneties', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'character', 'Roxanne', 'seduce', 'Ed', 'off.And', 'George', 'movie', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'As', 'funny', 'movie', 'still', 'grounded', 'reality', 'Dexter', 'dad', 'deadbeat', 'Ed', 'sadness', 'having', 'friends', 'Cheating', 'put', 'down', 'work', 'ethic', 'encouraged', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'role', 'models.On', 'side', 'note', 'actors', 'Kenan', '19', 'Kel', '18', 'grew', 'up', 'church', 'Kel', 'Chicago', 'Kenan', 'Atlanta', 'have', 'strong', 'relationships', 'mothers', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'July', '26th-August', '1st', 'issue', 'TV', 'Guide', 'adore', '.So', 'do', 'favor', 'order', 'large', 'portion', 'delicious', 'Good', 'Burger', 'still', 'available']",N/A

But, my brother, the Biggest Kid in the world, got me to watch it and I was crazy about this movie. I beatboxed through all the Fat Albert songs I thought I forgot and laughed while I did the dances.  I remembered so much that I thought I had forgotten about this cartoon and the cast was phenomenal for their parts. Once again, Fat Albert is trying to solve everyone's problems but ends up with a crush of his own, which creates a problem for him from going from t.v. to the Real World. It was also entertaining to see them around new inventions (cell phones, microphones, etc.)  The guy in the blue shirt and the one who liked Kyla were really cute by the way!On another note, I originally saw a bootleg version, but I bought the DVD so I could make sure to see the extras (plus I believe in supporting good movies).  I can't stop watching that doggone Making the Band extra though. I watch it ALL THE TIME!  I've watched it more than the movie.  It's almost obsessive.  I just love to hear people beatbox and rap.  It takes me back to old school hip-hop.  I was really disappointed that the guys who played the Fat Albert crew  weren't the ones who spoke on the behind-the-scenes version.

Sadly, ""Fat Albert"" is two and a half decades to late.The film starts with a young girl named Doris who is shy and not very popular, and feels like a total outcast at school. Running home after school and feeling totally bummed, she switches on the T.V. & watches an episode of ""Fat Albert & The Cosby Kids"".While watching the show, Doris finds out that the episode is similar to what she's facing in school & as a tear from Doris falls from her cheek & hits the T.V. remote magic happens (I could hear the film start to nosedive when this happened).In the animated world, Fat Albert senses trouble and looks to the sky. After seeing Doris' tear fall from the sky, a portal is opened and Albert jumps through into the real world. The Cosby Kids follow suit and find Doris totally freaked out. Albert calms her down saying the boys are here to help her with her problem. Of course, Doris denies this, but, Albert insists on solving her problem. A real problem arises when the boys notice that their colors are fading (they are after all animated) & have only a limited time to help Doris before they become nothing but a memory.There is a lot that isn't so hot with the film. Now don't get me wrong, I love Bill Cosby and all the work he's done in the past (from ""Picture Pages"" when he was on Captain Kangaroo all the way up to ""The Cosby Show"" & ""The Cosby Mysteries"". Not to mention his stand-up routines are classic).But, The Cos has had a few problems with trying to get a big screen hit & ""Fat Albert"" is no exception. The first problem is the animation. Its not in style with the old animation from the show (the new animation is too cartoonish). The moral of the story is too sunny and, I hate to say it, but, seems outdated (I know something better could have been brought to the table). What becomes animated should stay animated. It worked for ""Roger Rabbit"" & it could've worked here.The only nice touch to the film is when Albert meets his creator (you know who) and explains to him how and why he is in Doris' world. The end scene with Cosby and the gang that ""Fat Albert"" is based on, was also a charmer.""Fat Albert"" is a film that is made to attract new fans to the gang, but, sadly shuts out the older fans.I truly recommend the new DVD box set of the show, with all the original animation & voices, Cosby style.",1,"Anorexic ""Albert""",1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,2487,"['two', 'half', 'decades', 'trying', 'bring', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'big', 'screen', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'fatty', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'jump', 'Xmas', 'season', ""'04"", 'Sadly', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'two', 'half', 'decades', 'late.The', 'film', 'starts', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Doris', 'who', 'shy', 'not', 'very', 'popular', 'feels', 'total', 'outcast', 'school', 'Running', 'home', 'school', 'feeling', 'totally', 'bummed', 'T.V', 'episode', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'Cosby', 'Kids', '.While', 'watching', 'show', 'Doris', 'out', 'episode', 'similar', 'what', 'facing', 'school', 'tear', 'Doris', 'falls', 'cheek', 'T.V', 'remote', 'magic', 'happens', 'could', 'hear', 'film', 'start', 'nosedive', 'when', 'happened', 'animated', 'world', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'trouble', 'sky', 'seeing', 'Doris', 'tear', 'fall', 'sky', 'portal', 'opened', 'Albert', 'jumps', 'real', 'world', 'Cosby', 'Kids', 'follow', 'suit', 'find', 'Doris', 'totally', 'freaked', 'out', 'Albert', 'calms', 'down', 'saying', 'boys', 'are', 'here', 'help', 'problem', 'course', 'Doris', 'Albert', 'solving', 'problem', 'real', 'problem', 'arises', 'when', 'boys', 'notice', 'colors', 'are', 'fading', 'are', 'animated', 'have', 'only', 'limited', 'time', 'help', 'Doris', 'become', 'nothing', 'memory.There', 'lot', ""n't"", 'so', 'hot', 'film', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'work', 'done', 'past', 'Picture', 'Pages', 'when', 'was', 'Captain', 'Kangaroo', 'way', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Cosby', 'Mysteries', 'Not', 'mention', 'stand-up', 'routines', 'are', 'classic', '.But', 'Cos', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'trying', 'get', 'big', 'screen', 'hit', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'exception', 'first', 'problem', 'animation', 'not', 'style', 'old', 'animation', 'show', 'new', 'animation', 'too', 'cartoonish', 'moral', 'story', 'too', 'sunny', 'hate', 'say', 'outdated', 'know', 'something', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'table', 'What', 'animated', 'should', 'stay', 'animated', 'worked', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'could', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'here.The', 'only', 'nice', 'touch', 'film', 'when', 'Albert', 'creator', 'know', 'who', 'how', 'why', 'Doris', 'world', 'end', 'scene', 'Cosby', 'gang', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'based', 'was', 'also', 'charmer', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'film', 'made', 'attract', 'new', 'fans', 'gang', 'sadly', 'out', 'older', 'fans.I', 'truly', 'recommend', 'new', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'show', 'original', 'animation', 'voices', 'Cosby', 'style']",N/A

883215,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007N1A36,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","One thing you can say safely about the feature film version of `Fat Albert' is that the film's content is very sweet and good-natured. You can give a DVD of the film to a kid as a Christmas present without offending his or her parents. And people who grew up watching the original cartoons on TV in the 70s might love the new film. I'm sorry, but I'm not one of them, and the fact must have influenced my opinion. So, please read my review as such.Keenan Thompson plays the live-action Fat Albert (in a fat suit) who comes from the animated world after witnessing a high-school girl Doris (Kyla Pratt) weeping before the TV set. Don't ask me how this happens, but anyway Fat Albert and Cosby's gang come to the real world, where they help lonely Doris find a new life.As they are from the junkyard in the 70s, they are greatly surprised by everything they see and hear. And as they come from another world, they have to go back to where they belong. The film strictly follows these familiar rules, and it does not fail to include production placement, blatant reference to the DVD release of the original series.In fact, too much is going on in the film, and none of them really works. You just don't need animation characters to lead a more motivated life, but Doris does when she participates in the relay race at her school. There is an awkward romance involving the character of Albert, which goes nowhere after all, and the gags are all uninspired. Of course, those who still fondly remember the characters might find something refreshing, but except the fact that these live-action characters look exactly like the animated counterparts, there is nothing that I can find interesting in the feature film.The film includes a brief cameo from Bill Cosby himself in a weak sub-plot explaining the background of character of Fat Albert. I don't know Bill Cosby's reaction to the new film, and still I don't see why he sanctioned this pointless remake.",2,Sweet But Pointless Remake,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,1952,"['One', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'safely', 'feature', 'film', 'version', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'film', 'content', 'very', 'sweet', 'good-natured', 'can', 'give', 'DVD', 'film', 'kid', 'Christmas', 'present', 'offending', 'parents', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'original', 'cartoons', 'TV', '70s', 'might', 'love', 'new', 'film', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'fact', 'must', 'have', 'influenced', 'opinion', 'So', 'please', 'read', 'review', 'such.Keenan', 'Thompson', 'live-action', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'fat', 'suit', 'who', 'animated', 'world', 'witnessing', 'high-school', 'girl', 'Doris', 'Kyla', 'Pratt', 'weeping', 'TV', 'set', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'how', 'anyway', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'Cosby', 'gang', 'come', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'help', 'lonely', 'Doris', 'find', 'new', 'life.As', 'are', 'junkyard', '70s', 'are', 'greatly', 'surprised', 'everything', 'see', 'hear', 'come', 'world', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'where', 'belong', 'film', 'strictly', 'familiar', 'rules', 'not', 'fail', 'include', 'production', 'placement', 'blatant', 'reference', 'DVD', 'release', 'original', 'series.In', 'fact', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'none', 'really', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'animation', 'characters', 'lead', 'more', 'motivated', 'life', 'Doris', 'when', 'relay', 'race', 'school', 'awkward', 'romance', 'involving', 'character', 'Albert', 'nowhere', 'gags', 'are', 'uninspired', 'course', 'who', 'still', 'fondly', 'remember', 'characters', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'refreshing', 'fact', 'live-action', 'characters', 'look', 'exactly', 'animated', 'counterparts', 'nothing', 'can', 'find', 'interesting', 'feature', 'film.The', 'film', 'brief', 'cameo', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'weak', 'sub-plot', 'explaining', 'background', 'character', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'reaction', 'new', 'film', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'sanctioned', 'pointless', 'remake']",N/A
883216,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0007N1A36,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","I grew up watching ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"" on Saturday mornings.  Even though I don't remember the specifics of many episodes, I remember the shows general format and the theme song is something that I random find myself humming or singing sometimes.  The show had a lot of comedy, but each episode also contained an important message told in such a way that kids could understand it and incorporate it into their lives.  It wasn't until I was older that I learned Fat Albert had been a comedy sketch that Bill Cosby had created based upon his own life and that Fat Albert had indeed been a real person that Cosby had hung out with as a child.  ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"" was a great series to watch as a kid and I'm glad that some of the episodes are now available on DVD.However, as much as I enjoyed the Fat Albert show, I don't think it was necessary to make a live-action movie of the show.  Hollywood seems to be running dry on originality so eventually probably ever show ever made will be turned into a film sometime.  Not only that, but when Hollywood does turn tv shows into big screen movies, they usually change the show around so much that the movie really no longer resembles the show, e.g. THE DUKES OF HAZZARD.Sometimes the original format is changed, such as in BEWITCHED where Will Farrell's character is starring in an updated television version of the show.  FAT ALBERT is kind of like that.  Fat Albert and the gang are very happy in their animated lives.  However, a young female fan of the show, Doris, begins crying because she has no friends.  There can be magic in tears and Doris tears causes Fat Albert and the gang to leave their animated Philadelphia and enter her living room.  Cheerful as always Fat Albert and the gang do what they can to cheer Doris up and help her make friends.  However, Albert falls in love with Doris' foster sister, Lauri and doesn't want to return to his own home.  But Albert's decision has an effect on his whole gang because every moment they spend outside of their tv world causes them to fade.  If they don't return home soon, they will all fade away.FAT ALBERT doesn't contain cursing, sexual innuendo, or graphic violence.  Outside of a dance party, the antics of the live action versions of the animated characters stay true to the spirit of those characters.  The movie doesn't take anything away from the original television show and in some way enhances it because it has introduced a new generation to the lovable character of Fat Albert.  The movie does have some minor continuity flaws and at times it is a little sappy.  However, I didn't think I was going to like the movie very much but after viewing the film found that I enjoyed it.
