Nothing could be more from the truth !  His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, was relentless in his determination to thwart the Hitler-Mussolini terrorization and murder of millions of Jews, Catholics and other Cristian groups.  The vicious attacks by ignorant anti Catholic writers and critics have gone on for years but papers, reports and eye witness accounts over the same period, most notably the last several years, have totally demolished the false and bigoted charges made against Pius XII.  The Catholic Church, notably the newly elected Pope, Pius XII in 1938, did more to hide and disguise Jews and move them into convents, churches and ultimately out of Gemany and Italy to safety in allied countries than any other single organization.  These heroic deeds were recognized by the Head Rabbi Zolli of Rome so much so that he became a convert to Catholicism, taking the Christian name of Eugene after Eugenio Pacelli, the full name of Pius XII.  Years later, none other than Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir also praised the valiant efforts of Pius XII in her official thanks for saving thousands of Jewish lives.This film, THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, focuses on one of many heroes of the Holocaust, Monsignor Flaherty, brilliantly protrayed by Gregory Peck with a supporting cast of eminent actors and actresses including Christopher Plummer, John Gielgud and Raf Valone.Although the Pope, as portrayed by Gielgud, insists on the fact of neutrality to the Nazi regime and at times appears passive, in actuality, the real Pope Pius XII, was a master of his own war of words with Hitler, so much so that the Vatican was never harmed due to the world wide indignation over jsut the thought of a military reprisal by Hitler.  This movie should be a mandaatory part of any history class dealing with WWII.

He plays Father O'Flaherty, a boxing, snipping  Irish priest living in Rome at the height of the Nazi occupation. Father  O'Flaherty's job? Aside from usual priestly duties, he hides Jews in the  households of his friends and allies.But clearly the Nazis aren't going  to stand still while O'Flaherty does this. And so the Nazi commandant,  Christopher Plummer's Herbert Kapplar, a cold and ruthless man whose  reputation is rapidly going down the drain from his exalted position as he  tries to capture O'Flaherty.But don't think this is a bloodless drama  movie: There are comic moments as O'Flaherty sneaks out of the Vatican in  various disguises; a tense scene where guns fire at him as he hurdles back  into the Vatican disguised as a Nazi officer; and at the end there's a  beautiful scene for those of you who like love-filled, happy endings. Even  though there is a number of mentions of Catholiscism and God, I believe  this is a drama/war movie at its core, not a religious one.This is a  moving story about oppression and redemption. Even though you'll hate  Kapplar for his Nazi position, he's not a cookie-cutter villain: We can see  how he loves his wife and children. And O'Flaherty is no goody-goody  priest: we see him lose his temper, as well as refuse a plea for help  (although he later does it anyway). The characters are solidly  human.Olga Karlatos is excellent as a widow from Malta who is sort of  O'Flaherty's sidekick. And Sir John Gielgud has a relatively brief but very  important role as Pius XII, a man who has to walk a hideous  tightrope--giving O'Flaherty leave to hide as many Jews as possible, while  concealing this from the Nazis, who would overrun the Vatican if they found  out. (Bravo, Pius XII)A warning: Though this film is &quot;Not  Rated&quot; it's not a kiddie flick. People are shot violently, Nazis  attempt to stab O'Flaherty at one point, Nazis overrun people's homes and  hunt Jews down, a priest is beaten to death and eventually dies, and there  are some disturbing close-ups of bruised faces and a darning needle stuck  into a person's hand.

325502,AE0337VVP8MRM,630264366X,E. Borgman,"[4, 4]","This is an excellent film. I remember watching it when I was younger. I finally bought the DVD and still enjoyed it. I feel that this is Gregory Peck's best role and Christopher Plummer plays a great evil nemesis. One might question the choice of John Gielgud playing Pope Pius the XII however. Which brings me to the major flaw in this made for television movie. The portrayal of Pope Pius as, ""aloof"" (as it states on the back of the box) and having him pressure Monsignor O'Flaherty to stop helping Allied POWs in order to protect the Church, is just plain ludicris. Pope Pius ordered Catholic clergy to help save the lives of Jews which would have had his priests and nuns doing the exact same thing that Monsignor O'Flaherty was doing. Rabbi David G. Dalin is his amazing bookThe Myth of Hitler's Pope: Pope Pius XII And His Secret War Against Nazi Germanydetails examples of heroic clergy, who helped save lives from the hands of the Nazis, and these clegy told that they were ""ordered"" by the pope to do all they could to help save lives. Of course, at the time screenwriter David Butler was flushing out the storyline for his screenplay, Pope Pius XII's reputation had already been destroyed. In 1963 the KGB propaganda machine was behind Rolf Hochhuth's play entitled The Deputy which engineered a false history for Pius and his actions. Although fiction, Pope Pius' reputation was destroyed by one negative biography after another. Despite books by Rabbi Dalin and Joseph L. Lichten's A Question of Judgment and Hungarian Jewry and the Papacy: Pius XII Did Not Remain Silent by Jewish historian Jeno Levai, the lies have prevailed.

The Monsignor and his Italian associates hide escaping POW's who sought sanctuary at the Vatican once they had escaped unguarded Italian POW camps at the time of the Italian surrender and German occupation of Rome.

He is shown going in and out of the Vatican in disguises as a postman, a trinket salesman, a nun, a street sweeper and even a Nazi Officer!  Christopher Plummer plays a Nazi Colonel who becomes obsessed with capturing the Priest, his ring and the secret havens for hiding POWS that O'Flaherty has in motion. In this role he does very well, although his hair seems a bit long for Nazi military men of that era. The screenplay is gripping, tense, exciting, and above all entertaining because it is true. Honestly, I can't understand how this was ignored or perhaps it is indicative of bias on behalf of film award councils because it concerns a true righteous gentile who aided Jews in WW 2 and was responsible for the lives of perhaps 7,000 allied and Italian people wanted by the Nazi regime.

Pipher,"[2, 2]","This film, set in Nazi-occupied Rome during World War II, depicts the efforts of a remarkable member of the Vatican staff, Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, and, to a lesser extent, sheds some much needed light on the actions of the Pope during that war.  It would be a great film even if it weren't true, but, in this case, it is just that.  Gregory Peck portrays Monsignor O'Flaherty; Christopher Plummer, Colonel Kappler, the Gestapo Chief in Rome; and Gielgud, Pope Pius XII.In has long been Catholic policy to give sanctuary to those in eminent danger, and such was the case in Italy and in Nazi-occupied Rome during WWII.  The Vatican State was, of course, in a precarious position; surrounded by the Nazis it could offer no resistance if Hitler decided to invade.  The Pope, then, had to walk a fine line of neutrality; while, at the same time, hundreds of escaped British soldiers and downed-American and Allied airmen, along with hundreds of Jews and various other resistance fighters and refugees, were attempting to evade capture in hopes of gaining Vatican sanctuary.The plot of this film, then, revolves around Monsignor O'Flaherty's attempts to finance, organize, and maintain a secret group dedicated to finding safe havens for these hunted men while, at the same time, the Gestapo was doing everything in its power to root them out and punish those who sheltered them.  This makes for a very compelling film well worth watching.Some points of interest: At war's end, it was estimated that at the time of Rome's liberation O'Flaherty and his confederates were hiding over 6,500 people.  For his efforts, Monsignor O'Flaherty was subsequently made a `Commander of the British Empire' and was awarded the Medal of Freedom by the United States.

He was real and not one of them ""Barry Fitzgerald"" made-up priests.  He was called ""The Vatican Pimpernel"" because he managed to save over six thousand Jews and escaped allied POW's from the Nazi sharks during the second world war.  Gregory Peck plays him in THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, a made-for-TV mini-series in 1983.  Now the mini-series has been put together into one.  By the way, the title, THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, comes from two sources:  a monsignor was entitled to wear a scarlet band at the waist of his black robe, and and as you'll recall surely, they were the same colours as those of the Nazi flag.Now our own Christopher Plummer - a darlin' fellow - plays the nasty Nazi who has a white line painted across St. Peter's Square to mark the boundary of the Vatican State.  Now with Plummer on one side and Peck on the other, why you can see that the battle is drawn.  And by the by, Plummer gives a strong performance as SS-Obergruppenfuhrer,(don't worry now if you can't pronouce it, the war is over), and not one of his show-offy turns as he  did at other times.  The same is true of Gregory Peck, seen here in his later - and better - years.THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK has great shots of Rome and the Vatican, and the story is suspensefully told - lots of scary parts - with the duel to the death between between the priest and the Nazi its centrepiece.The cast of THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK is strong - watch for the fine Italian actor, Raf Vallone, always worth watching, and of course in those days you couldn't have Pope Pius XII in your movie unless you had John Geilgud (now Sir John I'll have you know).THE SCARLETT AND THE BLACK also has a nice surprise waiting for you at the end.

The one-dimensional Hollywood portrayal of every German was distracting. It all screams ""Made for TV.""Worst scene: Firing squad, Italian Army platoon. They fire wide, not wanting to kill the priest. Then SS Lt Col Kappler orders them to do their job. The Italian lieutenant pulls out his Beretta, locks and loads, aims at the priest, but doesn`t fire. Then Kappler pulls his own pistol, pushes aside the impotent Italian, and shoots the priest.I was not there; I cannot say what I would have done had I been there, but I am pretty sure that were I in the shoes of the Italian lieutenant, I would have called my men to present arms, load, and aim, and then, with the guns of the platoon pointing nearly at the SS officers, I would have shot SS Lt Col Kappler.If you want to see a great film on this subject, rent Amen.

325575,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,630264366X,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","Even after all these years [since the movie was first released], I find The Scarlet and the Black a riveting watch. Based on the true life exploits of Monsignor O'Flaherty [compellingly portrayed by Gregory Peck], the story recounts the events that unfolded during the Nazi occupation of Rome, led by SS officer Herbert Kappler [a rather evil and calculated performance by Christopher Plummer]. Though the Vatican is neutral during the war, the Pope and his staff find it incredibly difficult to remain calm when the Nazis begin terrorizing Rome's inhabitants [both Jews and non-Jews] and even torture a priest of the Church.Gregory Peck plays Monsignor O'Flaherty, a high-ranking and influential priest in the Vatican who actively helps escaped Allied POWs, Jewish refugees and anyone who is trying to flee the Nazis' reign of terror. As a man of the cloth, he helps all those who are in need, without reservations and one event in the movie [where he helps with gathering funds to 'ransom' the Jews of Rome] is particularly compelling. Based on real historical events, this active role played by the Monsignor is even more significant given the Catholic church's rather passive role during the Nazi reign of terror in Occupied Europe [as attested by historical accounts]. Placing himself in mortal danger, and under the scrutiny of the Gestapo [the Nazi Secret Police], Fr O'Flahery brazenly and cunningly carries out his heroic acts [at times under the very noses of the Nazis] and earns the wrath of SS Col Herbert Kappler, the Nazi in charge of Occupied Rome. Kappler as portrayed by Christopher Plummer is the epitome of Nazi cunning and totally without remorse, stooping to execute a priest, backing out of a verbal promise [assuring safety] to the Jewish community etc. Though he begins his 'reign' over Rome with much confidence, he loses his composure and self-assuredness as Fr O'Flaherty and company manage to get away from the Nazis time and time again.The story is well-told, with compelling human drama and lots of action. The suspense is built-up from the beginning, and the climax of the movie - a showdown between Kappler and Fr O'Flaherty is absolutely mind-blowing. It addresses an important question: in the face of so much evil, can one, especially a man of the cloth, overcome his personal convictions and extend mercy, or is he, in the end, merely human?Though the protagonist in this movie is a Catholic priest, there is no real focus on religion here and only minor religious references. This is quite a feat given that the movie is centered in Rome and the Vatican! A must-see for fans of WW II dramas, especially those who are keen on real-life dramas centering on the Nazi occupation of Europe.
