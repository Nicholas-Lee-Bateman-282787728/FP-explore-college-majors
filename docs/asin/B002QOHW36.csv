What may seem like a cheeky plot (and there are very brief moments, at times) is surprisingly executed with honesty, understanding, uncertainty, and (as it's title notes) choices. Rebecca St. James makes the amazing leap from singer to actress very subtly, yet carries the same amount of honesty, love and understanding as she does to her music. (You may be surprised by her performance at times, as well.) Overall, this is a well-made film with mostly solid performances, a fine-tuned script, and universal emotion to spare. A solid family pick.(For the record, the DVD came through the mail alright!

This movie took that subject on without flinching. Having never been in a position of either the prospective mother or father, I can only opine that the presentation of this seemed realistic. A lot of reviews have knocked the acting in this movie but I challenge those who slam the acting in this one to provide criteria instead of just a general statement concerning the lameness of the acting. I recently took lessons from a pro. He stressed continually that good acting is not acting at all but being natural. I thought Rebecca St. James was remarkable in her performance. Her timing and pregnant pauses and contemplative truth searching demonstrated through camera shots down into her soul via her eyes. I salute the producer's of this flick for taking on a very controversial subject and handling it with grace. If you're pro-life or pro-choice, you can enjoy this. If you're pro-abortion, this will probably infuriate you.",5,I liked it more than October Baby,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,1024,"['Abortion', 'one', 'issues', 'most', 'Christian', 'filmmakers', 'prefer', 'avoid', 'poison', 'ivy', 'movie', 'took', 'subject', 'flinching', 'Having', 'never', 'been', 'position', 'prospective', 'mother', 'father', 'can', 'only', 'opine', 'presentation', 'seemed', 'realistic', 'lot', 'reviews', 'have', 'knocked', 'acting', 'movie', 'challenge', 'who', 'slam', 'acting', 'one', 'provide', 'criteria', 'instead', 'just', 'general', 'statement', 'concerning', 'lameness', 'acting', 'recently', 'took', 'lessons', 'pro', 'stressed', 'continually', 'that', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'acting', 'being', 'natural', 'thought', 'Rebecca', 'St.', 'James', 'was', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'timing', 'pregnant', 'pauses', 'contemplative', 'truth', 'searching', 'demonstrated', 'camera', 'shots', 'down', 'soul', 'eyes', 'salute', 'producer', 'flick', 'taking', 'very', 'controversial', 'subject', 'handling', 'grace', ""'re"", 'pro-life', 'pro-choice', 'can', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'pro-abortion', 'will', 'probably', 'infuriate']",Sarah's Choice

Deniston ""dayspring7""","[2, 2]","Even though I'm a Christian, I don't tend to go for Christian films all that much, because the production values are often poor, and the acting and writing lackluster. Most of them are centered around End Times, football, or a ""Little House On the Prairie""-type scenario, and that gets old fast. ""Sarah's Choice"" is a step in the right direction. It's not preachy or looking like it's trying too hard, and the writing and acting are decent. However, I had two major beefs with it.First of all, Sarah should have peeked over the abyss a bit more--she could have met the mysterious stranger at the abortion clinic instead of the doctor's office. Calling a clinic on the phone didn't have as much punch. Her eventual choice would have been a lot less of a given if she had flirted with disaster.Secondly, I thought Rebecca St. James was good, and I've been a fan of hers for years, but there's one part where you hear tears in her voice and feel her emotion, but don't see them on her face. It's a weepy scene, so there should be a few waterworks. Don't actors use fake tears sometimes? There's no shame in that--Debbie Reynolds rubbed onions on her eyes when she had to cry in ""Singin' In the Rain.""""Sarah's Choice"" is a good film.
