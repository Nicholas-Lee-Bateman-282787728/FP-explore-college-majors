I'm going to college, and I work hard on the weekday evenings. So, why is a man like me going crazy over a cartoon about pretty ponies? You probably think that I escaped from the looney bin. Actually, that's not it. You see, I love cartoons. Always have, always will. I love cartoons going way back to Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse cartoons.As a cartoon lover, I feel that animation has taken a nose dive in the past decade. It seems that everything that made cartoons good in the old days just isn't there anymore. However, heres a cartoon that changes all of that. Don't let the ""My Little Pony"" name fool you. This show isn't the same '80s cartoon that feel like thirty minute long toy commercials for girls. This cartoon is actually... Well, a cartoon. The characters have depth and interesting personalities. The humor is well written, and has jokes that little kids wouldn't understand. The plots have conflicts that aren't always the easiest for the characters to fix. This is no kids show. This show is made to appeal to us, adults. It's a cartoon that you can watch with little kids and not want to shoot yourself. I hold is special because I've never seen any cartoon that's come this close to being just like the golden age cartoons. It's got everything:The wacky humor of ""Looney Tunes.""The colorful animation of Disney.It's got everything I want from a cartoon, and more.I'm glad to see that this show is finally getting a proper DVD treatment with a complete season being released.

I was amazed by the story writing and all the characters. It kept my attention from episode 1 all the way to this day still. I would say every single episode is good I don't dislike any episodes at all. Every episode seems to end with a lesson being learned which is pretty great because everyone ( everypony, lol ) needs to remember each of these lessons in life. The show is full of laughs from start to finish one episode after another. I'm a guy and I'm 32 years old and if I can enjoy this show so much and laugh at each and every episode a couple times then that means anyone can. I have no dislikes about the show, none. I would recommend this show to everyone ( everypony, lol ) any age. I'm just shocked , surprised how people can judge a book by its cover and when you admit to watching this show they think you have issues and say they would never watch this show based of its cover and mistaking it for a little girls show. It's okay, I use to feel this way all my life until I saw clips of the series Friendship Is Magic on sites like youtube and after watching I had even more respect for the show itself.

With such a high ranking in movies/tv one hopes that a second dvd set is around the corner and possibly a blu ray set.This reincarnation of the My little Pony franchise was written and developed by Lauren Faust whom I know from the wonderful series (I also own) called The Powerpuff Girls. She has been quoted in saying she developed this series so the WHOLE FAMILY can enjoy it. It shouldn't come to anybody's real surprise the strange amount of adult fans of the show then but it still surprises some.This series overall is about friendship and understanding. Sometimes even if you don't understand something (or someone aka Pinkie Pie) it's best not to judge or try and conform them. Our individuality is a wonderful thing and this show teaches that. If I had children I would be very happy to slap this dvd set in for them. I grew up playing with the first and second generation MLP dolls so it also brings me back to my childhood.Now on to one weird thing I've noticed off the bat. The person who designed this set from shout factory obviously hasn't watched the first season OR second season of the series because Princess Cadance graces the third disk of this SEASON ONE set. For all who don't know why this is a slight 'issue' is because she isn't introduced until the last episodes of the SECOND SEASON. Not a huge issue but the nerdy fan in me laughed at the error.After I get through the series I'll come back and comment on commentaries and more of the quality side of it.

1586520,AA0N0BG2CPY6N,B0096W47NO,Japanese Teeth,"[46, 51]","Putting aside the whole ""brony"" phenomenon, this show is still well worth the price, for a number of reasons:- The characters: This is where the show really shines.  The characters are all very well-rounded and surprisingly complex for a show aimed at this age group; it avoids lumping the characters into stereotypical roles. For example, in just about any other show, Rarity would be a stereotypical girly-girl, obsessed with boys, shopping, and hair.  Here, she's certainly a fashionista, but she's also a competent businesswoman, something of an artist, and knows how to handle herself in dangerous situations. All the cast members have a similar level of development, which lends itself really well to the slice-of-life nature of the show.- The character designs and animation are great.  It's cute and endearing, but not to the tooth-rot degree of previous generations, and it's still good for the occasional action sequence.  As a bonus it's very expressive and surprisingly detailed for a flash-based cartoon.- Ditto for the music; it doesn't necessarily stick out, but it definitely enhances the show as a whole.- Good writing: On the whole, the show avoids most of the pitfalls of kid shows by using lots of character-based humor and self-awareness that can appeal to viewers of any age and rarely feels patronizing towards the adult audience.  You don't need to be a kid to find it funny.  At the same time, the plots are generally executed well enough that they don't feel like rehashes of common plotlines, and even when the plots are quite simple they're still entertaining due to the charm that the characters bring to everything.- Good Acting: There's some serious voice talent here; Tara Strong (Twilight Sparkle) is basically the patron saint of voice acting, Andrea Libman displays some impressive range (voicing both Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie, two characters who have almost opposite personalities), Ashleigh Ball gives Rainbow Dash and Applejack very distinct voices, and Tabitha St. Germain does a great of job making Rarity into an entertaining and balanced character.This isn't to say that Season 1 is totally without fault; like all things, it has a few rough spots (In particular, the Cutie Mark Crusader based episodes can seem a bit same-y due to the characters having the same motivation in each), but overall it's consistently high quality and well worth checking out, even if you aren't a kid.  I've found that it has a degree of quality and subtlety that sets it apart from a lot of other children's programming.EDIT: Now that I have the DVD, I'm just going to throw in a few comments about the physical media aspects. I haven't had time to watch everything yet, but I've watched a few episodes worth on the various discs and they look good so far.1. The commentaries are very entertaining and interesting.  They aren't particularly ground-breaking, but it's fun to hear about some of the behind-the-scenes stuff from the show's staff.  There's a good selection of people from actors, to writers, to producers, and they definitely offer some interesting insights into the show.2. The audio and video quality are great.  It's not hi-def, but it's still perfectly good quality that really demonstrates the skill of animators and composers.3. The physical DVD box itself is sturdy, if without frills.The only things I can really complain about are rather insubstantial, but in the interest of fairness I'll include them anyway:1. The box artwork.  They use some of the same stock vectors that they use for 90% of the merchandise, which isn't bad in and of itself, but having seen it everywhere else it feels a bit lazy when it would have been fairly easy to use something new.  Also, one of the DVD's has an image of Princess Cadance, who doesn't actually appear in the series until the end of the second season.  It doesn't bug me, but I guess a kid could get confused wondering who the pink pony on the DVD is.2. The menu music. It's a loop of the ""My Little Pony"" line from the show's theme song, and if you listen to it for more than about 20 seconds it starts to get a bit annoying.  Again, an extremely minor issue, but one that could have been really easily solved by just sticking in some of the show's (excellent) BGM instead of a 10-second loop.So basically, the show itself is awesome, the DVDs maintain the quality, and the only issues are so insubstantial that they're barely worth mentioning.  They certainly aren't important enough to knock any stars off the rating.  If you were on the fence about buying the DVD, do it, it's completely worth it.(Note: I haven't checked out all the special features, like the coloring pages and whatnot on the fourth disc, but I doubt those will really factor much into the rating either)",5,One of the best kids' shows available.

1586527,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0096W47NO,Kenya Starflight,"[7, 8]","A few years back, a friend of mine (an adult male friend no less) approached me and told me I needed to watch the latest ""My Little Pony"" TV show, as it was ""awesome!""  I merely laughed politely and shrugged the suggestion off.  I remembered playing with My Little Ponies as a child and watching bits and pieces of the show, but even in those days I was more of a He-Man and Thundercats fan despite being a girl.  And nowadays my primary interests run more towards Star Wars, Transformers, and the Avengers than anything pink and frilly.Then I actually sat down to watch the show... and was quite pleasantly surprised.  What has traditionally been a merchandise-driven franchise aimed at little girls has become a clever, character-driven, and entertaining series that can be enjoyed (and quite frequently is) by any age and gender.In Equestria, a fantasy land populated by colorful, sentient ponies, a bookish and somewhat antisocial young unicorn named Twilight Sparkle is shipped off to the small town of Ponyville by her mentor and the ruler of Equestria, Princess Celestia, with orders to try and make some friends.  Twilight balks at first, weirded out by the eccentric inhabitants of Ponyville and more concerned with her studies.  It takes an ancient prophecy coming true, and the threat of Celestia's vengeful sister Nightmare Moon, to make Twilight realize that friendship has a power all its own, and it will take all her strength as well as the help of her newfound friends -- brash and tomboyish Rainbow Dash, shy animal lover Fluttershy, vain but kindhearted Rarity, down-to-earth workaholic Applejack, and crazy but enthusiastic Pinkie Pie -- to protect Ponyville and Equestria.Somehow this show, despite looking cutesy and girly on the surface, has managed to hit the right balance between kid-friendly and adult appeal.  It focuses primarily on the characters, with good character-driven stories, strong continuity between episodes, and jokes and references that make nods to the adult audience without veering into inappropriateness.  The characters make good role models for children as well -- they don't just focus on fashion or shopping or stereotypical ""girly"" stuff, but have their own goals and desires that they work to achieve, and have a multitude of different personalities so children can pick a character they feel they can identify closely to.  And most episodes end with a moral of some sort, which gives parents an opportunity to discuss the show and what can be learned from it with their children.The voicework is very well done as well -- every character has a distinctive and fitting voice, and you would never guess that some of the characters are voiced by the same voice actor/actress (such as Applejack and Rainbow Dash).  And even the songs are fun, catchy and cute.  Hopefully someone thinks to release an album outside of a fan project...The animation in the show is very good -- a smooth Flash-based animation, with colors that are bright and eye-catching without being over the top.  The world is imaginatively designed, altered just enough to accommodate for its four-legged inhabitants without being rendered totally unrecognizable to viewers.  And the show incorporates a surprising amount of mythology, including not just unicorns and pegasi but dragons, manticores, hydras, and other mythical creatures (later seasons of the show even make reference to wendigos and Cerberus, the three-headed guardian of the gates of Tartarus).  That and for being a little kid's show, it has some truly epic and sinister villains...I never thought I'd say this, but... I like My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.  Call it a guilty pleasure, but it's a fun, clever, and entertaining cartoon series, geared to appeal to a wide spectrum of viewers and not just little girls.  Hasbro and the Hub have a winner here, and I hope they keep the series going strong in Season 4.",5,"Fun and clever cartoon appeals to all ages and genders, not just little girls",1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,3906,"['few', 'years', 'back', 'friend', 'mine', 'adult', 'male', 'friend', 'less', 'approached', 'told', 'needed', 'watch', 'latest', 'Little', 'Pony', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'awesome', 'merely', 'laughed', 'politely', 'shrugged', 'suggestion', 'remembered', 'playing', 'My', 'Little', 'Ponies', 'child', 'watching', 'bits', 'pieces', 'show', 'even', 'days', 'was', 'more', 'He-Man', 'Thundercats', 'fan', 'being', 'girl', 'nowadays', 'primary', 'interests', 'run', 'more', 'towards', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Transformers', 'Avengers', 'anything', 'pink', 'frilly.Then', 'actually', 'sat', 'watch', 'show', 'was', 'quite', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'What', 'traditionally', 'been', 'merchandise-driven', 'franchise', 'aimed', 'little', 'girls', 'become', 'clever', 'character-driven', 'entertaining', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'frequently', 'age', 'gender.In', 'Equestria', 'fantasy', 'land', 'populated', 'colorful', 'sentient', 'ponies', 'bookish', 'somewhat', 'antisocial', 'young', 'unicorn', 'named', 'Twilight', 'Sparkle', 'shipped', 'small', 'town', 'Ponyville', 'mentor', 'ruler', 'Equestria', 'Princess', 'Celestia', 'orders', 'try', 'make', 'friends', 'Twilight', 'balks', 'first', 'weirded', 'out', 'eccentric', 'inhabitants', 'Ponyville', 'more', 'concerned', 'studies', 'ancient', 'prophecy', 'coming', 'true', 'threat', 'Celestia', 'vengeful', 'sister', 'Nightmare', 'Moon', 'make', 'Twilight', 'realize', 'friendship', 'power', 'own', 'will', 'take', 'strength', 'as', 'well', 'help', 'newfound', 'friends', 'brash', 'tomboyish', 'Rainbow', 'Dash', 'shy', 'animal', 'lover', 'Fluttershy', 'vain', 'kindhearted', 'Rarity', 'down-to-earth', 'workaholic', 'Applejack', 'crazy', 'enthusiastic', 'Pinkie', 'Pie', 'protect', 'Ponyville', 'Equestria.Somehow', 'show', 'looking', 'cutesy', 'girly', 'surface', 'managed', 'hit', 'right', 'balance', 'kid-friendly', 'adult', 'appeal', 'primarily', 'characters', 'good', 'character-driven', 'stories', 'strong', 'continuity', 'episodes', 'jokes', 'references', 'make', 'nods', 'adult', 'audience', 'veering', 'inappropriateness', 'characters', 'make', 'good', 'role', 'models', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'focus', 'fashion', 'shopping', 'stereotypical', 'girly', 'stuff', 'have', 'own', 'goals', 'desires', 'work', 'achieve', 'have', 'multitude', 'different', 'personalities', 'children', 'can', 'pick', 'character', 'feel', 'can', 'identify', 'closely', 'most', 'episodes', 'end', 'moral', 'sort', 'parents', 'opportunity', 'discuss', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'children.The', 'voicework', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'distinctive', 'fitting', 'voice', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'characters', 'are', 'voiced', 'same', 'voice', 'actor/actress', 'such', 'Applejack', 'Rainbow', 'Dash', 'even', 'songs', 'are', 'fun', 'catchy', 'cute', 'Hopefully', 'someone', 'release', 'album', 'outside', 'fan', 'project', 'animation', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'smooth', 'Flash-based', 'animation', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'eye-catching', 'being', 'top', 'world', 'imaginatively', 'designed', 'altered', 'just', 'enough', 'accommodate', 'four-legged', 'inhabitants', 'being', 'rendered', 'totally', 'unrecognizable', 'viewers', 'show', 'surprising', 'amount', 'mythology', 'including', 'not', 'just', 'unicorns', 'pegasi', 'dragons', 'manticores', 'hydras', 'other', 'mythical', 'creatures', 'later', 'seasons', 'show', 'even', 'make', 'reference', 'wendigos', 'Cerberus', 'three-headed', 'guardian', 'gates', 'Tartarus', 'being', 'little', 'kid', 'show', 'truly', 'epic', 'sinister', 'villains', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'say', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'Friendship', 'Magic', 'Call', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'fun', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'cartoon', 'series', 'geared', 'appeal', 'wide', 'spectrum', 'viewers', 'not', 'just', 'little', 'girls', 'Hasbro', 'Hub', 'have', 'winner', 'here', 'hope', 'keep', 'series', 'going', 'strong', 'Season', '4']",My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic: Season 1

If you want to know what it's about, read any of the other 80+ reviews lavishing praise on the series, or, better yet, record a few episodes from the Hub on your DVR or Tivo. I'm going to discuss the stuff people reading these reviews actually care about: picture/sound quality, packaging, and extras.Picture/Sound Quality = This set looks as good as any of the other MLP:FiM DVDs released by Shout! Factory. Really, this show can only look so good on DVD. The picture quality is great for a Flash-animated show on DVD, but it won't look great if you're used to the 1080p iTunes releases of the episodes.Packaging = This set contains four DVDs in one case. Each disc is well-protected and easy to access. The art on the front and back of the case is pretty good. I'm less thrilled with the illustrations on the third and fourth discs (third disc has an illustration of Princess Cadance, a character not introduced until the Season Two finale! while the fourth disc has a questionably illustrated Princess Celestia). This is all nit-picking, though. Everything is bright and colorful. The case comes with a slip-cover illustrated the same as the case. The case itself is see-through, and the opposite side of the paper with the cover art displays a very pretty layout of various characters walking around Ponyville while also listing the various episodes in the set.Extras = I counted six episodes with full commentary tracks (Friendship is Magic parts 1 and 2, Winter Wrap-Up, Suited for Success, The Show Stoppers, and The Best Night Ever). Commentators for these episodes include a couple of Hasbro execs, Jayson Thiessen, James Wootton, Nicole Oliver, Cathy Weseluck, Andrea Libman, Tabitha St. Germain, and Daniel Ingram. The commentators have a lot of fun talking about these episodes, although, far and away, my favorite commentary so far is the one for ""Suited for Success,"" in which Daniel Ingram talks quite a bit about the difficulties in finalizing the songs in that episode. There's nothing mind-blowing in these commentaries, but it is fun to hear Ingram talk about the music and the voice actors talk about the various characters.Beyond the commentaries, there are short ""Pony Profiles"" in which the Mane Six are briefly introduced, downloadable coloring sheets, and two sing-a-longs (for the extended version of the title theme and At the Gala, respectively). These are mainly for children, but the sing-a-longs are definitely cute.All-in-all, this is a solid set, and well worth investing in if you want to support the show's official release.

I had reservations about this show after reading about the brony phenomenon on the internet and seeing a few, now obviously skewed, tv spots about it. Being a fan of most animation and willing to watch a few episodes of any series at least once I gave it a spin one weekend. It was much better than I had anticipated. The characters have depth and well presented distinct personalities. And if you watch out for them, culture references abound as well.  After researching a small bit and finding that it was Lauren Faust who put this version together I knew why it was so good, as Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home immediately came to mind. Now, I remember the original version from the 80's. I didn't watch it as I was too busy watching He-Man and Transformers and building forts in the woods in those days. But the flow of the show and the morality tales that are included at the end of each episode give it a bit of a nostalgic feel for me which I enjoy and admittedly is what hooked me most.

A few such shows, like the original He-Man, acquire a certain ignominious cult following in the ""so bad it's good"" category. Seriously, that one had to be far and away the campest children's show ever made...But, I digress.This, the latest incarnation in the My Little Pony franchise, does not fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category. It's just good. Really good. Smart, too.On a superficial level the tried and true formula remains unchanged. Candy-bright characters and sickly-sweet morality tales parade across our screens, preaching the same tired old lessons kids have rammed down their throats in so many other shows. Poor devils.The good part comes in the delivery. The writing, the voice acting, and the artwork are all genuinely witty, and everything is handled with a certain deft panache. Without being in any way hard or cynical, much less descending into mere self-parody, beneath the surface the underlying sensibilities are actually rather grown-up. There's a definite feeling of adults at play here, of a show created by people who genuinely had a lot of fun in making it. Perhaps as a result there's a real lightness of touch, and both the show itself and the individual characters are all utterly charming. It's sweet, but not saccharine.For us, the humble viewers, the funniest parts by far are when the ponies totally freak out and ""lose it"". I've put ""lose it"" in quotation marks because it actually is a quote. I first found my way to this show via a clip on YouTube entitled ""Pinkie Pie Loses It"". There's also a host of other similar clips from the show that have been uploaded to that site. So if you've not seen this cartoon before and would like to get a feeling for why it has the cult following it does, the best advice I can give you is to stop reading reviews here on Amazon and go look at some of those clips for yourself.Have fun!Theo.",5,Edgy Cute,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,1969,"['Let', 'face', 'cartoon', 'based', 'line', 'toys', 'generally', 'speaking', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'few', 'such', 'shows', 'original', 'He-Man', 'acquire', 'certain', 'ignominious', 'cult', 'following', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'category', 'Seriously', 'one', 'had', 'be', 'far', 'away', 'campest', 'children', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'digress.This', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'franchise', 'not', 'fall', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'category', 'just', 'good', 'Really', 'good', 'Smart', 'superficial', 'level', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'unchanged', 'Candy-bright', 'characters', 'sickly-sweet', 'morality', 'tales', 'parade', 'screens', 'preaching', 'same', 'tired', 'old', 'lessons', 'kids', 'have', 'rammed', 'down', 'throats', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'Poor', 'devils.The', 'good', 'part', 'delivery', 'writing', 'voice', 'acting', 'artwork', 'are', 'genuinely', 'witty', 'everything', 'handled', 'certain', 'deft', 'panache', 'being', 'way', 'hard', 'cynical', 'much', 'less', 'descending', 'mere', 'self-parody', 'surface', 'underlying', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'actually', 'rather', 'grown-up', 'definite', 'feeling', 'adults', 'play', 'here', 'show', 'created', 'people', 'who', 'genuinely', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'making', 'Perhaps', 'result', 'real', 'lightness', 'touch', 'show', 'individual', 'characters', 'are', 'utterly', 'charming', 'sweet', 'not', 'saccharine.For', 'humble', 'viewers', 'funniest', 'parts', 'far', 'are', 'when', 'ponies', 'totally', 'freak', 'out', 'lose', ""'ve"", 'put', 'lose', 'quotation', 'marks', 'actually', 'quote', 'first', 'found', 'way', 'show', 'clip', 'YouTube', 'entitled', 'Pinkie', 'Pie', 'also', 'host', 'other', 'similar', 'clips', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'uploaded', 'site', 'So', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'cartoon', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'feeling', 'why', 'cult', 'following', 'best', 'advice', 'can', 'give', 'stop', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'go', 'look', 'clips', 'yourself.Have', 'fun', 'Theo']",My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic: Season 1
