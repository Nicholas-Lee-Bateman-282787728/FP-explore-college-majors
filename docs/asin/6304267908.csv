410522,A3TIJC6L8USJ6Q,6304267908,Elderbear,"[33, 34]","Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a German theologian who dared to cling to the teachings of Jesus in the context of the Third Reich. He preached and taught in the portion of the Church that went underground rather than bend their knee to Adolph Hitler. Eventually, his sense of ethics drove him to working with a cell of the German resistance, seeking to overthrow Hitler and arrange a peace settlement with the Allies. He also helped a number of Jews get safely into Switzerland, in spite of a Swiss policy against such emmigrations.Ed Asner's narration is great. Bonhoeffer's story is compellingly told. The issues that challenged him are presented clearly, as are some of his struggles with how to behave ethically and in a Christ-like manner within Hitler's Reich.Although the movie focuses on Bonhoeffer, it also drives the point home of how readily the established churches compromised and sacrificed the clear teachings of Jesus in order to fit in to the Reich. Seeking the approbation of man (even if of such a horrifying group of men as the Gestapo), most churches abandoned the Gospel in favor of appeasement. While not as pathetic a betrayal of Jesus as, say, the Spanish Inquisition, this certainly was a dark hour for Christianity.This is a 60 to 90 minute documentary, expanded to a full two hours by padding with hymn fragments and either Nazi footage or modern cinematography of places key to Bonhoeffer's life. ...Boenhoeffer's theology clearly saw Jesus incarnate in His Church and in the human community. Although many Fundamentalist Christians claim him as their own, he was not. He preached and lived a Spirituality that ventured beyond personal piety and salvation and insisted on a truly Christian Praxis to more fully incarnate Christ in the world of the Church....",4,A Passable Documentary of a Remarkable Thinker & Martyr,1020384000,"05 3, 2002",2002,1780,"['Dietrich', 'Bonhoeffer', 'was', 'German', 'theologian', 'who', 'dared', 'cling', 'teachings', 'Jesus', 'context', 'Third', 'Reich', 'preached', 'taught', 'portion', 'Church', 'went', 'rather', 'bend', 'knee', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'Eventually', 'sense', 'ethics', 'drove', 'working', 'cell', 'German', 'resistance', 'seeking', 'overthrow', 'Hitler', 'arrange', 'peace', 'settlement', 'Allies', 'also', 'helped', 'number', 'Jews', 'get', 'safely', 'Switzerland', 'spite', 'Swiss', 'policy', 'such', 'emmigrations.Ed', 'Asner', 'narration', 'great', 'Bonhoeffer', 'story', 'compellingly', 'told', 'issues', 'challenged', 'are', 'presented', 'clearly', 'are', 'struggles', 'how', 'behave', 'ethically', 'Christ-like', 'manner', 'Hitler', 'Reich.Although', 'movie', 'Bonhoeffer', 'also', 'point', 'home', 'how', 'readily', 'established', 'churches', 'compromised', 'sacrificed', 'clear', 'teachings', 'Jesus', 'order', 'fit', 'Reich', 'Seeking', 'approbation', 'man', 'even', 'horrifying', 'group', 'men', 'Gestapo', 'most', 'churches', 'abandoned', 'Gospel', 'favor', 'appeasement', 'not', 'pathetic', 'betrayal', 'Jesus', 'say', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'certainly', 'was', 'dark', 'hour', 'Christianity.This', '60', '90', 'minute', 'documentary', 'expanded', 'full', 'two', 'hours', 'padding', 'hymn', 'fragments', 'Nazi', 'footage', 'modern', 'cinematography', 'places', 'key', 'Bonhoeffer', 'life', 'Boenhoeffer', 'theology', 'clearly', 'saw', 'Jesus', 'incarnate', 'Church', 'human', 'community', 'many', 'Fundamentalist', 'Christians', 'claim', 'own', 'was', 'not', 'preached', 'lived', 'Spirituality', 'ventured', 'personal', 'piety', 'salvation', 'insisted', 'truly', 'Christian', 'Praxis', 'more', 'fully', 'incarnate', 'Christ', 'world', 'Church']",Hanged on a Twisted Cross VHS

This documentary chronicles his life history as a Lutheran pastor, mainly highlighting his ideological battle against Nazism and the German church, Catholic and protestant, which became more and more corrupt and apostate under Hitler, his minions, people of counterfeit faith, see II Timothy 3:8.  In 1935, the Confessing Church was formed by famed theologian Karl Barth, Bonhoeffer and others to counter the rising anti-semitism in Germany and the apostasy of the established churches, catholic AND protestant.  Clearly such activities would not go unnoticed by the Nazi's.  Seeing this video directed me to other writings of his as excerpts from his sermons, lectures, and writings are a part of the narration done by Ed Asner.  Bonhoeffer died as a martyr on April 9, two days before the concentration camps were liberated in 1945.  I HIGHLY recommend that this movie be seen.I'm sure Bonhoeffer must have pondered Ephesians 5:11 in choosing to work outside of mainstream christianity as it existed in Germany-Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them, and Revelation 18:4 says: Come out of her (Babylon/Rome see also Daniel 2) my people, lest you partake of her sins...for her sins have reached to heaven.",5,'SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN THE STATE OF' CHRISTIANITY,1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,1294,"['was', 'Bonhoeffer', 'day', 'still', 'documentary', 'life', 'history', 'Lutheran', 'pastor', 'mainly', 'highlighting', 'ideological', 'battle', 'Nazism', 'German', 'church', 'Catholic', 'protestant', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'corrupt', 'apostate', 'Hitler', 'minions', 'people', 'counterfeit', 'faith', 'see', 'II', 'Timothy', '3:8', '1935', 'Confessing', 'Church', 'was', 'formed', 'famed', 'theologian', 'Karl', 'Barth', 'Bonhoeffer', 'others', 'counter', 'rising', 'anti-semitism', 'Germany', 'apostasy', 'established', 'churches', 'catholic', 'AND', 'protestant', 'Clearly', 'such', 'activities', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'Nazi', 'Seeing', 'video', 'directed', 'other', 'writings', 'excerpts', 'sermons', 'lectures', 'writings', 'are', 'part', 'narration', 'done', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Bonhoeffer', 'died', 'martyr', 'April', '9', 'two', 'days', 'concentration', 'camps', 'were', 'liberated', '1945', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'movie', 'be', 'seen.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Bonhoeffer', 'must', 'have', 'pondered', 'Ephesians', '5:11', 'choosing', 'work', 'mainstream', 'christianity', 'existed', 'Germany-Do', 'not', 'participate', 'unfruitful', 'deeds', 'darkness', 'instead', 'even', 'expose', 'Revelation', '18:4', 'Come', 'Babylon/Rome', 'see', 'also', 'Daniel', '2', 'people', 'lest', 'partake', 'sins', 'sins', 'have', 'reached', 'heaven']",Hanged on a Twisted Cross VHS
