1127775,A32RF0KJA4ZE6E,B0010X8NNC,Alanna Evans,"[2, 5]","Negima is another harem comedy by the creator of Love Hina and this time dressed up in Harry Potter clothes.  Negi is the star of the show, a ten year old boy who is a genius and magic user (though restricted to not use his magic, something that fizzles alot of the fun out of the first dozen or so episodes).  He's also now a teacher at a school and his class is a 30 odd bunch of teenage girls, all who find him irresistable (stars in their eyes romantic notions all around, I'm afraid).Watching Negima felt like a huge chore.This is a cleaned up version, but the animation is still substandard, the music forgettable, and the whole bit of having a 10 year old boy for a teacher, trying to teach a class full of teenage girls (who dream of him as some kind of romantic paragon) is downright creepy.  The many excuses to kiss him are ridiculous and get more grating as the show wears on and girls are chasing after him relentlessly.  It's uncomfortable, not particularly comedic and completely forgettable.  That is, until the studio decided to do *something* about trying to wrap up the plotline.Negima was still being churned out in manga form and thus did not have a complete story when this series was being made (something that happens quite frequently).  So instead of just leaving it hanging, they decided to put together a final arc that would bring some sort of closure to the series.  This made the fanboys (and fangirls) FURIOUS but I applaud their decision.  The last arc gives weight and substance to a series that was otherwise harem fluff in Harry Potter clothes.  The final arc brings everyone together and fleshes out the relationships a little more solidly.  It's good stuff, that keeps you on the edge of your seat with emotions at stake.  Something the series kept free from, til that point.What else does Negima do right?  It has a HUGE cast of characters (there are over 30 students in Negi's class alone, not to mention other teachers and other characters as well).  Through clever selection and varied plotlines we are introduced to the majority of these students and really get to know them.  This is a feat that seems overwhelming impossible at the beginning but its done with amazing ease and no force feeding of characters and their quirks.  By the end of the series, you feel as if they are real fleshed out characters, and not just cardboard cutouts.  The personalities are so diverse too and you even get to meet a robot, a vampire and a ghost (among others, ninja twins perhaps?) The colors of many of the girls' hair was changed from a sea of plain browns to a crayon box of crazy dyes.  This does help to identify them and was a nice idea (even if the fans, again, didn't like it...I can imagine the confusion that would have lead if they had stuck to the manga on this).The English dub is also quite nice, with Greg Ayres even squeaking out a bit of an English accent for Negi himself.  This boxset is rather unappealing to look at (the colours!  agh! my eyes!) but you get all the discs and a little booklet so it's a good choice for the price.There's even a cheaper version coming too, so you might want to hold out for that one.",3,The Final Arc Saves It...,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,3167,"['Negima', 'harem', 'comedy', 'creator', 'Love', 'Hina', 'time', 'dressed', 'up', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'clothes', 'Negi', 'star', 'show', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'genius', 'magic', 'user', 'restricted', 'not', 'use', 'magic', 'something', 'alot', 'fun', 'first', 'dozen', 'so', 'episodes', 'also', 'now', 'teacher', 'school', 'class', '30', 'odd', 'bunch', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'find', 'irresistable', 'stars', 'eyes', 'romantic', 'notions', ""'m"", 'afraid', '.Watching', 'Negima', 'felt', 'huge', 'chore.This', 'cleaned', 'up', 'version', 'animation', 'still', 'substandard', 'music', 'forgettable', 'whole', 'bit', 'having', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'teacher', 'trying', 'teach', 'class', 'full', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'dream', 'kind', 'romantic', 'paragon', 'downright', 'creepy', 'many', 'excuses', 'kiss', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'get', 'more', 'grating', 'show', 'girls', 'are', 'chasing', 'relentlessly', 'uncomfortable', 'not', 'particularly', 'comedic', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'studio', 'decided', 'do', '*something*', 'trying', 'wrap', 'up', 'plotline.Negima', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'churned', 'out', 'manga', 'form', 'thus', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'complete', 'story', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'something', 'quite', 'frequently', 'So', 'instead', 'just', 'leaving', 'hanging', 'decided', 'put', 'together', 'final', 'arc', 'would', 'bring', 'sort', 'closure', 'series', 'made', 'fanboys', 'fangirls', 'FURIOUS', 'applaud', 'decision', 'last', 'arc', 'weight', 'substance', 'series', 'was', 'otherwise', 'harem', 'fluff', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'clothes', 'final', 'arc', 'everyone', 'together', 'out', 'relationships', 'little', 'more', 'solidly', 'good', 'stuff', 'edge', 'seat', 'emotions', 'stake', 'Something', 'series', 'kept', 'free', 'til', 'point.What', 'else', 'Negima', 'do', 'right', 'HUGE', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', '30', 'students', 'Negi', 'class', 'alone', 'not', 'mention', 'other', 'teachers', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'clever', 'selection', 'varied', 'plotlines', 'are', 'introduced', 'majority', 'students', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'feat', 'overwhelming', 'impossible', 'beginning', 'done', 'amazing', 'ease', 'force', 'feeding', 'characters', 'quirks', 'end', 'series', 'feel', 'are', 'real', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'personalities', 'are', 'so', 'diverse', 'too', 'even', 'get', 'meet', 'robot', 'vampire', 'ghost', 'others', 'ninja', 'twins', 'perhaps', 'colors', 'many', 'girls', 'hair', 'was', 'changed', 'sea', 'plain', 'browns', 'crayon', 'box', 'crazy', 'dyes', 'help', 'identify', 'was', 'nice', 'idea', 'even', 'fans', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'can', 'imagine', 'confusion', 'would', 'have', 'lead', 'had', 'stuck', 'manga', '.The', 'English', 'dub', 'also', 'quite', 'nice', 'Greg', 'Ayres', 'even', 'squeaking', 'out', 'bit', 'English', 'accent', 'Negi', 'boxset', 'rather', 'unappealing', 'look', 'colours', 'agh', 'eyes', 'get', 'discs', 'little', 'booklet', 'good', 'choice', 'price.There', 'even', 'cheaper', 'version', 'coming', 'too', 'might', 'want', 'hold', 'out', 'one']",Negima!

1127779,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0010X8NNC,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","Negi Springfield is often touted as Japan's answer to Harry Potter, although in personality he's a bit more like Hermione.And while the wizard prodigy isn't quite shown to his full potential in the anime adaptation ""Negima,"" where stretches of fluffy harem comedy are speckled with serious magic and action. While it starts slowly and relies too heavily on semi-nudity and slapsticky antics, the more wizardly adventures end up keeping it worth watching.Middle-school student Asuna is desperately hoping that her crush, Professor Takahata, will be teaching homeroom at Mahora Academy this year... and her mood is further soured by a preteen boy who tells her, ""Not everyone can be lucky in love.""Turns out the boy, a Welsh prodigy named Negi Springfield, IS the new teacher. Most of the girls immediately love him, but Asuna is enraged by Negi's ""weirdness"" -- when she glimpses him magically saving a student, his secret comes out: Negi is a wizard, and if Asuna reveals his secret he'll be turned into an ermine. Fortunately, Asuna agrees to keep his secret... if he makes a love potion for her, with predictably chaotic results.And soon Negi is faced by a creature from his family past -- a vampiric student who is determined to drain his blood. And he has to deal with myriad other troubles -- web idols, vicious volleyball teams, kiss contests, spying cheerleaders, a timid ghost, and a scheming ermine. And when Negi's job hangs on his class's bottom-of-the-barrel test scores, Asuna organizes a trip to the mysterious Library Island to get a magical book that can make even the Dummy Force smart!But things take a dark turn near the end of the series -- a trip to Kyoto goes awry when Konoka is threatened, and the mysterious sword-wielding Setsuna reveals her true identity. And upon returning, Asuna becomes increasingly ill -- leading Negi to discover a horrifying secret in her past, which links the doomed girl to his vanished father.Ken Akamatsu's original manga is pretty much balanced out -- part of it is slam-bang magic'n'action, while the other part is kooky romantic comedy and crazy slapstick. And for the anime, ""Negima"" serves up an incredibly heavy dose of the kooky comedy/crazy slapstick, with an emphasis on busts, robots, superpowered kicks, ninjas and the occasional skyscraper-sized demon.In fact many episodes are nothing but poor Negi getting swamped by his high-spirited students and the devious ermine Chamo's manipulations (which involve awkward kissing). Lots of skimpy clothes, confessions of love, bear panties and kooky dialogue (""Side effects may include dry mouth, nausea and loss of about a million brain cells...""). It's like an amped-up romantic sitcom with some magical trappings.While the comedic stories are fun in a disposable way, what makes the series truly watchable is the magic-oriented episodes -- aerial battles with tiny blonde vampires and playing chase with a giant stone golem amongst them. The end of the series is when the magical adventures really take front-and-center: though the whole trip to Kyoto rushes by way too fast, the final bittersweet arc is nothing short of brilliant.It's icky to see teenage girls pursuing a ten-year-old, but Negi is a likable little hero -- he's earnest, unselfish, and completely devoted to his students even if they're insane. Asuna is his opposite -- brash, temperamental, unexpectedly warmhearted -- and serves as a mildly violent big-sister type, although their roles unexpectedly switch near the finale.Surprisingly the rest of the cast plenty of fleshing-out as well -- sweet Konoka, mysterious Setsuna, the antisocial web idol Chisame (""This is CHIU's world and all you bimbos are mere tenants!""), serene ninja Kaede, and the loopy princess Ayaka (who has a surprisingly tragic past). Most memorable is the prepubescent vampire-mage Evangeline (""It's enough to make ANYONE CRAZY!""), and her cat-loving robot Chachamaru.The complete ""Negima"" season is a bit too heavy on the fluffy comedy, and too light on the magical adventures. But it's still worth watching for those who need a bit more Magorum magic.",3,It's only magic,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,4107,"['Negi', 'Springfield', 'often', 'touted', 'Japan', 'answer', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'personality', 'bit', 'more', 'like', 'Hermione.And', 'wizard', 'prodigy', ""n't"", 'quite', 'shown', 'full', 'potential', 'anime', 'adaptation', 'Negima', 'where', 'stretches', 'fluffy', 'harem', 'comedy', 'are', 'speckled', 'serious', 'magic', 'action', 'slowly', 'relies', 'too', 'heavily', 'semi-nudity', 'slapsticky', 'antics', 'more', 'wizardly', 'adventures', 'end', 'up', 'keeping', 'worth', 'watching.Middle-school', 'student', 'Asuna', 'desperately', 'hoping', 'crush', 'Professor', 'Takahata', 'will', 'be', 'teaching', 'homeroom', 'Mahora', 'Academy', 'year', 'mood', 'further', 'soured', 'preteen', 'boy', 'who', 'Not', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'lucky', 'love', 'out', 'boy', 'Welsh', 'prodigy', 'named', 'Negi', 'Springfield', 'new', 'teacher', 'Most', 'girls', 'immediately', 'love', 'Asuna', 'enraged', 'Negi', 'weirdness', 'when', 'magically', 'saving', 'student', 'secret', 'out', 'Negi', 'wizard', 'Asuna', 'secret', ""'ll"", 'be', 'turned', 'ermine', 'Fortunately', 'Asuna', 'keep', 'secret', 'love', 'potion', 'predictably', 'chaotic', 'results.And', 'soon', 'Negi', 'faced', 'creature', 'family', 'past', 'vampiric', 'student', 'who', 'determined', 'drain', 'blood', 'deal', 'myriad', 'other', 'troubles', 'web', 'idols', 'vicious', 'volleyball', 'teams', 'kiss', 'contests', 'spying', 'cheerleaders', 'timid', 'ghost', 'scheming', 'ermine', 'when', 'Negi', 'job', 'hangs', 'class', 'bottom-of-the-barrel', 'test', 'scores', 'Asuna', 'trip', 'mysterious', 'Library', 'Island', 'get', 'magical', 'book', 'can', 'make', 'even', 'Dummy', 'Force', 'smart', 'things', 'take', 'dark', 'turn', 'end', 'series', 'trip', 'Kyoto', 'awry', 'when', 'Konoka', 'threatened', 'mysterious', 'sword-wielding', 'Setsuna', 'true', 'identity', 'returning', 'Asuna', 'increasingly', 'ill', 'leading', 'Negi', 'discover', 'horrifying', 'secret', 'past', 'doomed', 'girl', 'vanished', 'father.Ken', 'Akamatsu', 'original', 'manga', 'pretty', 'much', 'balanced', 'out', 'part', 'slam-bang', 'magic', ""n'action"", 'other', 'part', 'kooky', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'crazy', 'slapstick', 'anime', 'Negima', 'up', 'incredibly', 'heavy', 'dose', 'kooky', 'comedy/crazy', 'slapstick', 'emphasis', 'busts', 'robots', 'superpowered', 'kicks', 'ninjas', 'occasional', 'skyscraper-sized', 'demon.In', 'fact', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'nothing', 'poor', 'Negi', 'getting', 'swamped', 'high-spirited', 'students', 'devious', 'ermine', 'Chamo', 'manipulations', 'involve', 'kissing', 'Lots', 'skimpy', 'clothes', 'confessions', 'love', 'bear', 'panties', 'kooky', 'dialogue', 'Side', 'effects', 'may', 'include', 'dry', 'mouth', 'nausea', 'loss', 'million', 'brain', 'cells', 'amped-up', 'romantic', 'sitcom', 'magical', 'comedic', 'stories', 'are', 'fun', 'disposable', 'way', 'what', 'series', 'truly', 'watchable', 'magic-oriented', 'episodes', 'aerial', 'battles', 'tiny', 'blonde', 'vampires', 'playing', 'chase', 'giant', 'stone', 'golem', 'end', 'series', 'when', 'magical', 'adventures', 'really', 'take', 'front-and-center', 'whole', 'trip', 'Kyoto', 'rushes', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'final', 'bittersweet', 'arc', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant.It', 'icky', 'see', 'teenage', 'girls', 'pursuing', 'ten-year-old', 'Negi', 'likable', 'little', 'hero', 'earnest', 'unselfish', 'completely', 'devoted', 'students', 'even', ""'re"", 'insane', 'Asuna', 'opposite', 'brash', 'temperamental', 'unexpectedly', 'warmhearted', 'serves', 'mildly', 'violent', 'big-sister', 'type', 'roles', 'unexpectedly', 'switch', 'finale.Surprisingly', 'rest', 'cast', 'plenty', 'fleshing-out', 'well', 'sweet', 'Konoka', 'mysterious', 'Setsuna', 'antisocial', 'web', 'idol', 'Chisame', 'CHIU', 'world', 'bimbos', 'are', 'mere', 'tenants', 'serene', 'ninja', 'Kaede', 'loopy', 'princess', 'Ayaka', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'tragic', 'past', 'Most', 'memorable', 'prepubescent', 'vampire-mage', 'Evangeline', 'enough', 'make', 'ANYONE', 'CRAZY', 'cat-loving', 'robot', 'Chachamaru.The', 'complete', 'Negima', 'season', 'bit', 'too', 'heavy', 'fluffy', 'comedy', 'too', 'light', 'magical', 'adventures', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'who', 'need', 'bit', 'more', 'Magorum', 'magic']",Negima!

Negima is my favorite harem series and that's only because Ken Akamatsu had the guts to change it from a romantic comedy to an action despite the higher ups wanting to cash on the success of Love Hina.

This anime is the first adaption of the series and is the most faithful until the OVA. As a result, the anime only followed up to the Kyoto arc before going its own way. As a result, we get a disappointing ending to a great series that is known for the genre shift into the action. You only get a few battle scenes in this series and more fanservice episodes. This series slowly tried to develop the characters but given how the series ended, only a few of the girls got the spotlight.The Kyoto arc in itself was rushed largely so there was no hope of characters like Kotoro to make an appearance or Fate to be threatening.So in the end, I give this series a 4 stars mainly because the ending was lame for me and the fact that it could have followed the manga way better.",4,The Original Negima Anime Adaption,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,1218,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'right', 'now', 'Negima', 'favorite', 'harem', 'series', 'only', 'Ken', 'Akamatsu', 'had', 'guts', 'change', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'action', 'higher', 'ups', 'wanting', 'cash', 'success', 'Love', 'Hina', 'result', 'series', 'was', 'able', 'attract', 'large', 'demographic', 'genders', 'ages', 'heavy', 'fanservice', 'result', 'lot', 'gay', 'jokes', 'were', 'added', 'later', 'appeal', 'ladies~', 'manga', 'best', 'anime', 'first', 'adaption', 'series', 'most', 'faithful', 'OVA', 'result', 'anime', 'only', 'followed', 'up', 'Kyoto', 'arc', 'going', 'own', 'way', 'result', 'get', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'great', 'series', 'known', 'genre', 'shift', 'action', 'only', 'get', 'few', 'battle', 'scenes', 'series', 'more', 'fanservice', 'episodes', 'series', 'slowly', 'tried', 'develop', 'characters', 'given', 'how', 'series', 'ended', 'only', 'few', 'girls', 'got', 'spotlight.The', 'Kyoto', 'arc', 'was', 'rushed', 'largely', 'was', 'hope', 'characters', 'Kotoro', 'make', 'appearance', 'Fate', 'be', 'threatening.So', 'end', 'give', 'series', '4', 'stars', 'mainly', 'ending', 'was', 'lame', 'fact', 'could', 'have', 'followed', 'manga', 'way', 'better']",Negima!

The set is packaged in two thinpack DVD boxes, and each thinpack box includes two DVDs.  The first two discs include seven episodes, while the third disc contains six episodes, and the final disc includes six episodes and the special features.  For special features, there is a textless version of the opening, textless versions of both endings, as well as trailers.When you start watching the set, Negima! comes off as a rather light-hearted show.  But as you progress through the series, the tone starts changing.  The tonal change becomes a bit more noticeable on disc three, and the tonal shift is completed on disc four.  By the end of disc four, expect to see some pathos, and you might need a handkerchief while watching a couple of the episodes.In some respects, I'm disappointed at the relative lack of effort FUNimation put into this set.

The basic story shows us with a unbelievably male teacher abut age 10 by the name of Negi Springfield from England whose in Japan while hiding the fact that he's actually a student wizard trying to graduate from Wizard school and become a full Magister Magorum.  Along the way not only does Negi have to contend with magical mayhem but a group of young female students who've become infatuated with him.  The series is a nice touch of romantic comedy, romance, drama, and action but nothing to serious to worry to much about,  the only drawback I have to say is with the dubbing while all the cast play their characters with great feeling and say their lines with good ability and as expected the Japanese voice cast were great sadly they should have chosen someone else to be the dubbed voice of Negi.  Don't get me wrong the actor is very proficient in almost all his other roles but as he tries to use his British accent for the character it just seems to high-pitched and annoying to listen to where I'm forced to just go to the subbed audio cast instead. The extras are pretty decent some trailers, bloopers, character profiles, schoolgirl commentaries, Japanese cultural notes, and of course the usual textless intro/ending songs. The series is still greatly entertaining to watch and the animation and soundtrack are great for the show I say this set is a must for anime fans to at least try out, and if you're still not sure check out a few episodes on HULU or youtube.

You have two young boys who can do magic, and there the similarities end.  Harry Potter was never chased around romantically by thirty-one junior high school girls each trying to steal a kiss.  WithLove Hinacreator Ken Akamatsu at the helm you know you are in for a good time.You have to accept this basic premise of ""Negima!"" before you can enjoy the series.  Negi Springfield is a ten-year-old wizard-in-training from Wales, with dreams of becoming the Magister Magi (Master Mage).  In the meantime, he has been hired as an English teacher for the Mahora Girls Academy in Japan, as well as being the homeroom teacher for class 2-A.  The Mahora Girls Academy is not all it seems at first, as its students include vampires, ghosts and robots, although all the normal students never seem to notice this.  Of course, all the girls develop crushes on the cute 10-year old, and hijinks ensue.The ""Negima!"" animated series follows the first volumes of the comic for the most part, and then suddenly veers away.  The reason for this is that the anime eventually out-paced the comic, and so a new storyline was invented.  This storyline, showing up around episode 19 or so, is quite different from the comic and might come as a shock to some.  However, it is very well-handled, and I appreciate having two versions of the story.This ""Negima!:Complete Collection (Viridian Collection)"" is the second 26-episode complete boxset release from Funimation.  The set was previously released asNegima! Box SetThe ""Viridian Collection"" is a stripped down and less expensive version of the series, presented in slim cases and without extra features.  I personally really appreciate the thin cases, as it takes up less space in my ever-increasing DVD collection.Both box sets have revised and re-drawn animation, as the animation from the original TV release in Japan was notoriously terrible.  The animated series is also much more ""family-friendly"" than the comic.  Most of the fan-service is implied rather than directly shown, so if you only read ""Negima!"" for the panties you might be a little disappointed.  The English-language script takes the ""family friendly"" approach even further, and is slightly different from the Japanese. Many of the ""double entendres"" and sexual humor has been removed.And while I am not usually a fan of dubbing, a special shout out needs to be done here for Funimation's English-language cast.  They have done a great job, even going so far as to give Negi a Welsh accent.  This is one case where they might be better than the Japanese original cast.
