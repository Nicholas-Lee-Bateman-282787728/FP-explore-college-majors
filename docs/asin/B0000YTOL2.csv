It kinda makes you think you're going to get an OK movie, but once they move into the house, it starts to get better, but then just crashes downhill. It becomes extremely boring and the setting of a trashy-looking house doesn't make a good and enjoyable setting. I'm wondering if some of these thrills are even supposed to make people thrilled or creeped out, because one or two scenes are actually good comedy material, like that snake scene. The ending was OK, and kind of intense, but it can't make the film better, and it just flops. It is NOT a movie I would want to see even a second time. It's just 1 1/2 to 2 hours of waiting for the film to actually get better.",1,Now do you even wanna call this a thriller?,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,769,"['Most', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'drama', 'thrills', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'thrilling', 'beginning', 'OK', 'kinda', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'OK', 'movie', 'once', 'move', 'house', 'get', 'better', 'then', 'just', 'crashes', 'downhill', 'extremely', 'boring', 'setting', 'trashy-looking', 'house', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'setting', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'thrills', 'are', 'even', 'supposed', 'make', 'people', 'thrilled', 'creeped', 'out', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'comedy', 'material', 'snake', 'scene', 'ending', 'was', 'OK', 'kind', 'intense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'better', 'just', 'NOT', 'movie', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'even', 'second', 'time', 'just', '1', '1/2', '2', 'hours', 'waiting', 'film', 'actually', 'get', 'better']",N/A
789324,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000YTOL2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I expected a little more out of `Cold Creek Manor'.  It had the potential to be a decent thriller.  The plot is spine tingling, but then again it's executed so comically that it turns into a spoof before you have a chance to be scared.  The script is full of corny dialog, clich&eacute;d sequences of events and predictable plot twists, and the direction by Mike Figgis is horrid.  The acting for the most part is awful and don't get me started on the music which is so obnoxious it kills any ounce of tension.  The snake scene alone is so over the top it made my laugh.  I'm getting ahead of myself though, so let me at least get the plot rundown for you first.Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone play Cooper and Leah Tilson.  When an accident almost cost their youngest son his life they decide to leave the city life and move out into the country.  That's when they find Cold Creek Manor, a beautiful house just bursting at the seams with secrets, secrets that Cooper, a documentary film maker, is just itching to expose.  One of those secrets, Dale Massie, shows up in their home with a proposition.  Dale was the previous owner of the home and lost possession while he was serving a three-year stint in prison.  He offers to help restore the property for a small fee so he can bounce back on his feet.  The Tilson's reluctantly agree and soon they wish they had stayed in the city as Dale gets creepier and more dangerous with each passing day.Dennis Quaid is so detached from his character it almost appears as if he realizes the movie is a disaster and is regretting ever signing on in the first place.  Sharon Stone is a wreck.  I've come to realize that this woman can only act maybe ten percent of the time, maybe less.  In fact the only film I've ever seen her turn in a good performance was `Casino' but aside from that she's nothing more than laughable.  Stephen Dorff is the only redeeming factor here.  His performance as Dale Massie, while nothing original about it, is at least wholly believable and creepy.  Dorff is good at playing the villain.  Too bad he's never really broken out into the main stream, even after his turn in `Blade'.  Juliette Lewis is forgettable as Ruby and Dana Eskelson comes off stupid as Sheriff Fergusun.In fact just about everyone in this film comes off a bit stupid.  When Ruby starts pushing Leah around in the bar it's so childish looking it's laughable.  Kristen Stewart and Ryan Wilson disappear into the background unless they're screaming obnoxiously or, worse yet, trying to act.  When Kristen frantically calls her parents over to the pool uttering the words ""there's something over here"" or something like that it sounds so phony it's, yet again, laughable.  I only wish Christopher Plummer's character would have garnered more screen time.  As the Massie father he's creepy and intriguing, but only lends his helping hand briefly and thus can't save the film from the wreckage.The film flops around and becomes tired fast.  The tense scenes, as I mentioned, are completely ransacked by the ridiculous score, and the overacting is so atrocious its cringe worthy.  The ending is probably the best part of the film, while it's also quite predictable and frustrating.  The film could have gone a much better route with the material.  With the use of hand held camcorders and creepy home videos it could have capitalized on its potential and delivered a chilling good time but instead it sticks to the same ol' same clich&eacute;s and delivers nothing more than a waste of time.  The house isn't even all that creepy, and with better lighting and MUCH better music that problem could have been dealt with quick.",1,"A disaster beyond words, which is sad because I was expecting more...",1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,3658,"['expected', 'little', 'more', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'decent', 'thriller', 'plot', 'spine', 'tingling', 'then', 'again', 'executed', 'so', 'comically', 'spoof', 'have', 'chance', 'be', 'scared', 'script', 'full', 'corny', 'dialog', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'sequences', 'events', 'predictable', 'plot', 'twists', 'direction', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'horrid', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'awful', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'music', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'ounce', 'tension', 'snake', 'scene', 'alone', 'so', 'top', 'made', 'laugh', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'so', 'let', 'least', 'get', 'plot', 'rundown', 'first.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'play', 'Cooper', 'Leah', 'Tilson', 'When', 'accident', 'almost', 'cost', 'youngest', 'son', 'life', 'decide', 'leave', 'city', 'life', 'move', 'out', 'country', 'when', 'find', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'beautiful', 'house', 'just', 'bursting', 'seams', 'secrets', 'secrets', 'Cooper', 'documentary', 'film', 'maker', 'just', 'itching', 'expose', 'One', 'secrets', 'Dale', 'Massie', 'up', 'home', 'proposition', 'Dale', 'was', 'previous', 'owner', 'home', 'lost', 'possession', 'was', 'serving', 'three-year', 'stint', 'prison', 'help', 'restore', 'property', 'small', 'fee', 'can', 'bounce', 'back', 'feet', 'Tilson', 'reluctantly', 'agree', 'soon', 'wish', 'had', 'stayed', 'city', 'Dale', 'creepier', 'more', 'dangerous', 'passing', 'day.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'so', 'detached', 'character', 'almost', 'movie', 'disaster', 'regretting', 'ever', 'signing', 'first', 'place', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'wreck', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realize', 'woman', 'can', 'only', 'act', 'maybe', 'ten', 'percent', 'time', 'maybe', 'less', 'fact', 'only', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'turn', 'good', 'performance', 'was', 'Casino', 'aside', 'nothing', 'more', 'laughable', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'only', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'here', 'performance', 'Dale', 'Massie', 'nothing', 'original', 'least', 'wholly', 'believable', 'creepy', 'Dorff', 'good', 'playing', 'villain', 'Too', 'bad', 'never', 'really', 'broken', 'out', 'main', 'stream', 'even', 'turn', 'Blade', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'forgettable', 'Ruby', 'Dana', 'Eskelson', 'off', 'stupid', 'Sheriff', 'Fergusun.In', 'fact', 'just', 'everyone', 'film', 'off', 'bit', 'stupid', 'When', 'Ruby', 'pushing', 'Leah', 'bar', 'so', 'childish', 'looking', 'laughable', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Ryan', 'Wilson', 'disappear', 'background', ""'re"", 'screaming', 'obnoxiously', 'worse', 'yet', 'trying', 'act', 'When', 'Kristen', 'frantically', 'parents', 'pool', 'uttering', 'words', 'something', 'here', 'something', 'so', 'phony', 'yet', 'again', 'laughable', 'only', 'wish', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'garnered', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Massie', 'father', 'creepy', 'intriguing', 'only', 'helping', 'hand', 'briefly', 'thus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'wreckage.The', 'film', 'flops', 'becomes', 'tired', 'fast', 'tense', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'are', 'completely', 'ransacked', 'ridiculous', 'score', 'overacting', 'so', 'atrocious', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'ending', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'predictable', 'frustrating', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'much', 'better', 'route', 'material', 'use', 'hand', 'held', 'camcorders', 'creepy', 'home', 'could', 'have', 'capitalized', 'potential', 'delivered', 'chilling', 'good', 'time', 'instead', 'same', 'ol', 'same', 'clich', 'eacute', 'delivers', 'nothing', 'more', 'waste', 'time', 'house', ""n't"", 'even', 'creepy', 'better', 'lighting', 'MUCH', 'better', 'music', 'problem', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', 'quick']",N/A
789325,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B0000YTOL2,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[1, 2]","Cold Creek Manor certainly seems like the kind of movie that would be fantastic to watch on a rainy night. The kind of movie that you can't watch with the lights off. At least, this is what I gathered from the previews. Instead, we get a huge mess of a movie that's bogged down with too much lame exposition in the middle. I thoroghly enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so, excited about how the movie was going to progress, but unfortunately it didn't deliver.Quaid plays a documentarian who moves his wife and two children out to the country into a huge creepy looking house called Cold Creek Manor. The house is filled with photos and video from the previous owners. Quaid's character (I can't remember his name because honestly, the movie is hardly worth remembering at all) sifts through this stuff, trying to figure out the mysterious past of the ex-owners. Then along comes Dale (Dorff) who has lived in the house his whole life and wants to offer his expertise in helping the new family fix it up. He's creepy and unlikeable, and I don't know why they bother to keep him around. If that guy showed up at my house I would put up an electric fence and hire an armed guard. As the tireless plot unfolds, we learn that Dale has serious issues and secrets about the house and his past.Despite the fact that this movie is tedious and overdrawn (Where was the editor when this movie was being made), the beginning will hook you in anyway. The middle is boring. And the end is wrapped up perfectly with a little pink bow in a completely anti-climactic way. While it has it's bit of thrill, it's nothing to jump up and down about-- the best thrill for me having to do with snakes.I like Dennis Quaid, I really do, but this movie is just not worth seeing, no matter how much I like the guy. If you want to be bored to tears after getting all excited with the prospect of seeing a good film in the beginning, you better throw out this movie right away because you'll definitely be disappointed. The only amendment I'll give this movie is the fact that young teens may like it because it boasts a creepy house and Stephen Dorff.",2,One Big Thrilling Mess,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,2121,"['Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'certainly', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'fantastic', 'watch', 'rainy', 'night', 'kind', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lights', 'off', 'least', 'what', 'gathered', 'previews', 'Instead', 'get', 'huge', 'mess', 'movie', 'bogged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'lame', 'exposition', 'middle', 'thoroghly', 'enjoyed', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'excited', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'progress', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver.Quaid', 'plays', 'documentarian', 'who', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'country', 'huge', 'creepy', 'looking', 'house', 'called', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'house', 'filled', 'photos', 'video', 'previous', 'owners', 'Quaid', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'honestly', 'movie', 'hardly', 'worth', 'remembering', 'sifts', 'stuff', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'mysterious', 'past', 'ex-owners', 'Then', 'Dale', 'Dorff', 'who', 'lived', 'house', 'whole', 'life', 'offer', 'expertise', 'helping', 'new', 'family', 'fix', 'up', 'creepy', 'unlikeable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'bother', 'keep', 'around', 'guy', 'showed', 'up', 'house', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'electric', 'fence', 'hire', 'armed', 'guard', 'tireless', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'learn', 'Dale', 'serious', 'issues', 'secrets', 'house', 'past.Despite', 'fact', 'movie', 'tedious', 'overdrawn', 'Where', 'was', 'editor', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'beginning', 'will', 'hook', 'anyway', 'middle', 'boring', 'end', 'wrapped', 'up', 'perfectly', 'little', 'pink', 'bow', 'completely', 'anti-climactic', 'way', 'bit', 'thrill', 'nothing', 'jump', 'up', 'down', 'about', 'best', 'thrill', 'having', 'do', 'snakes.I', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'really', 'do', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'worth', 'seeing', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'like', 'guy', 'want', 'be', 'bored', 'tears', 'getting', 'excited', 'prospect', 'seeing', 'good', 'film', 'beginning', 'better', 'throw', 'out', 'movie', 'right', 'away', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'only', 'amendment', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', 'fact', 'young', 'teens', 'may', 'like', 'creepy', 'house', 'Stephen', 'Dorff']",N/A
789326,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,B0000YTOL2,atmj,"[1, 2]","Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone could do so much more.This movie starts out with Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone's family  living in NY city, she with a high paid job and he working from home on low-budget documentaries.  He's the house husband and she the breadwinner.  A single incident scares them into abandoning their hectic city lives and they bail to the country.Cold Creek manor is a crumbling mansion in the country, with a history.  You see the surprise on the locals when a new family moves in.  You know there is something odd from that. Ironically, they move in, with no history of the place and none of the locals offer any insights.  Anyone who's moved into a small town knows there is always one busybody that has to fill you in, once you are committed.  It just seems so vague and unrealistic here.  Closing on real estate, selling and buying is a long process.  They must have a great lawyer.As time goes one, some unsettling items are found in the house and outside.  Then a development forces Dennis Quaid to look further into the property he has moved his family into.  Things go downhill from there.I can't go further without ruining the few so-so surprises this movie has in store.  There are a couple of tense moments.  The real irony of it is, this movie is probably more like real life than all the slashers or other horror movies out there.  This means you don't get the adrenaline rush, but it is somewhat more believable and boring unfortunately.The characters are also off.There is development in ways that make no sense.Sharon Stone goes from powerhouse business woman to a timid housewife in flowered dresses.Dennis Quaid goes from a inquistive documentary maker, to one with his head in the sand about this house.The teenage girl is a sassy city snot, and changes to sassy country snot (OK this was predictable)and the boy becomes obsessed with the items found in the house, but only enough to rattle a couple people.There are a lot of underlying currents here that never are used or explained.  It goes from tense to tenser and then really bad in a single scene.Also there is a shot when they are being helped from the roof, where and a man strolls by in the background.

It's supposed to be about a crazy man who wants his old house back, so what he does is terrorize the family that moves in.  It just so happens this big beautiful house is in the middle of nowhere, in a big forest with a nice swimming pool out back.However, the man only really terrorizes the family on 3 occasions, and for a grand total of 15 minutes (with the house being swarmed with snakes being the only memorable part).  Hilarious where these snakes were popping up, haha.  The rest of the movie is devoted to utter uselessness.  No suspense until the ending, and the parts involving a giant hole in the ground had potential for suspense and enticing storytellng but it was all wasted with little in the way of excitement thanks to never being included in the script until the very end of the movie.  A similar problem occurs in the beginning when the one daughter finds a suspicious stone in the back woods while playing with her brother, and yet, this is never mentioned again.  Poor!The family is dreadfully boring.  Dennis Quaid plays the role of a boring protective father that of course wants to assure the crazy lunatic doesn't come near his family, however I've seriously seen similar suspenseful situations better executed on the Lifetime Movie Network.  Quite lousy.  The mother is attractive but uninteresting, and so are the kids that never do a darn thing.Only the bad guy himself kept me tuning into this one, and he honestly didn't accomplish much other than show that he can be a short-tempered hothead capable fo being super destructive when provoked or threatened.  Really terrible.  Even then his inclusion in the movie is inexcusable because he's so weak looking and not the least bit intimidating... and yet, the entire small town is incredibly afraid of him.  Give me a break!  Also bizarre how he didn't even try to win over the kids- he just insisted on killing the entire family due to his vengeful attempts.  All this really did was make the kids seem even more unnecessary.The ending was shallow in that it didn't leave me satisfied for a spectacular ending- just another cliched ending I've seen a thousand times.  It was also unrealistic the way the family was overwhelmed and then suddenly came back with a vengeance, not to mention this scene didn't last long enough to make much of an impact.  Where were the kids while this was going on?I only have negative things to say about this one.  Poor writing all around and no atmosphere to speak of with a story that drags and drags.

They find a run-down estate called Cold Creek Manor and purchase it from the bank, who had foreclosed it from Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff) who went to prison for Manslaughter. When they move in and begin renovating it, Dale appears again and Cooper hires him to help renovate. Things happen that causes Cooper to suspect that Dale is not the helpful person he first sets off to be and Cooper, a documentarian, begins to study the history of Cold Creek Manor and finds some sinister history that theatens his family.This movie was directed by Mike Figgis, a director who has had made good suspense movies such as ""Internal Affairs"" in the past and is considered to be pretty respected by Hollywood. However, he is given such a poor script that is filled with cliches and puzzling character motives that he is left with nothing to work with. And on top of that he does not lead with strong direction with all the characters. Take the first 10 minutes. Cooper, a guy who seems like he is doing fine in Manhattan, suddenly finds the city to unhealthy for his children and he, his cosmopolitan wife and city kids suddenly move, not into the suburbs (like Greenwich or Long Island) but a remote farm in a city filled with stereotypical, city hating hicks. Yes, the script is poor at showing the Tilson's disdain for the city as a place to raise children, but Figgis doesn't help by providing us with anything other than an unfortunate potential accident.Figgis and the script also does a poor job explaining the history behind Cold Creek Manor. All we know is that it belonged to a sheep raising family called the Massies with a domineering grandfather and there was some pedophilia type of pictures that show up. The fact that Dale's previous family disappearing doesn't even appear until Cooper finds a retainer in the ground that one of the Massie children was wearing in a picture in the last third of the movie.Another strange development is the appearance and acceptance of Dale Massey in the movie. If a guy was snooping around the house uninvited, I would not offer him a job. But the Tilson's not only offer him a job, but also give him lunch and don't even bother discussing how creepy he is after he leaves. I mean, are they all that dense? (Except for daughter Kristen).Maybe the movie could have been saved with a clever plot twist or superior atmosphere, but that is nearly missing. It get a touch interesting when the find the Devils Throat, but it is a ripoff of ""The Ring"". The ending is even worse because it is provides the prototypical dumb hick who thinks he's smarter than the city folk, against the innocent, quietly intelligenct city folk who has to fight back against Redneck Rage (you know, the rich taking what belongs to them in their backyard). It is handled with such generic aplomb, I was certain I had seen this ending before many times, even though I could not name a movie off the top of my head.Dennis Quaid plays Cooper with a fearful, submission. Cooper is the usual city-riche liberal who thinks he is doing good by providing for the local ilk. It is a character that is paper thin and Quaid does not attempt to waste his talents (he is also sort of a emotionless actor) improving on his role. Sharon Stone as the cosmopolitan Leah (even the name smells of Yuppee) is the executive fast tracking wife with questionable ethics and a sense of guilt. She plays her limited role with more realism and I could even image her being a person in real life (imagine that!).However, the two antagonists are horrible. Stephen Dorff plays Dale. Dorff, who looks like a twin brother to similarly coiffed Craig Sheffer, plays the dumb, revengeful antagonist. He has been pulled directly from the ""Bad Guy's Handbook"". He does the typical things that a bad guy does. He kills people in his way, he treats his woman badly, he chases the protagonist in a car chase then disappears, he kills something that's near and dear to the protagonist and his family and he also has his over the top moment at the end of the movie revealing all his motives and his hate. Of course, Stephen Dorff is a generic actor whose body of work I never really liked from the beginning (he even made character Deacon Frost in Blade generic). And there is Juliette Lewis, whom I think really has defiencies in the brain. She plays a woman who gets beaten by her boyfriend, he kills her sister and yet in the end, she goes to his grave to show her love (because he seems pretty good in the sack). I mean, in every movie from Kalifornia to Natural Born Killers to Strange Days, she appears to be a dimwit in her role. Nothing changes here. Maybe Figgis owed her a favor and put her in this role out of sympathy because she no reason for existing.Anyway, this movie is a bust, even with it's favorable cast and director. If you want suspense, wait for the anticipated Mystic River and save your hard earned dough...Rating: C-",2,Generic work from Mike Figgis,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,5084,"['Tilsons', 'are', 'quiet', 'Manhattan', 'family', 'move', 'out', 'Dangerous', 'city', 'country', 'side', 'where', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'raise', 'children', 'find', 'run-down', 'estate', 'called', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'purchase', 'bank', 'who', 'had', 'foreclosed', 'Dale', 'Massie', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'who', 'went', 'prison', 'Manslaughter', 'When', 'move', 'begin', 'renovating', 'Dale', 'again', 'Cooper', 'help', 'renovate', 'Things', 'happen', 'Cooper', 'suspect', 'Dale', 'not', 'helpful', 'person', 'first', 'off', 'be', 'Cooper', 'documentarian', 'study', 'history', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'sinister', 'history', 'family.This', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'director', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'good', 'suspense', 'movies', 'such', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'past', 'considered', 'be', 'pretty', 'respected', 'Hollywood', 'However', 'given', 'poor', 'script', 'filled', 'cliches', 'puzzling', 'character', 'motives', 'left', 'nothing', 'work', 'top', 'not', 'lead', 'strong', 'direction', 'characters', 'Take', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'Cooper', 'guy', 'who', 'doing', 'fine', 'Manhattan', 'suddenly', 'city', 'unhealthy', 'children', 'cosmopolitan', 'wife', 'city', 'kids', 'suddenly', 'move', 'not', 'suburbs', 'Greenwich', 'Long', 'Island', 'remote', 'farm', 'city', 'filled', 'stereotypical', 'city', 'hating', 'hicks', 'Yes', 'script', 'poor', 'showing', 'Tilson', 'disdain', 'city', 'place', 'raise', 'children', 'Figgis', ""n't"", 'help', 'providing', 'anything', 'other', 'unfortunate', 'potential', 'accident.Figgis', 'script', 'also', 'poor', 'job', 'explaining', 'history', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'know', 'belonged', 'sheep', 'raising', 'family', 'called', 'Massies', 'domineering', 'grandfather', 'was', 'pedophilia', 'type', 'pictures', 'show', 'up', 'fact', 'Dale', 'previous', 'family', 'disappearing', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'Cooper', 'retainer', 'ground', 'one', 'Massie', 'children', 'was', 'wearing', 'picture', 'last', 'third', 'movie.Another', 'strange', 'development', 'appearance', 'acceptance', 'Dale', 'Massey', 'movie', 'guy', 'was', 'snooping', 'house', 'uninvited', 'would', 'not', 'offer', 'job', 'Tilson', 'not', 'only', 'offer', 'job', 'also', 'give', 'lunch', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'discussing', 'how', 'creepy', 'mean', 'are', 'dense', 'daughter', 'Kristen', '.Maybe', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'saved', 'clever', 'plot', 'twist', 'superior', 'atmosphere', 'nearly', 'missing', 'get', 'touch', 'interesting', 'when', 'find', 'Devils', 'Throat', 'ripoff', 'Ring', 'ending', 'even', 'worse', 'prototypical', 'dumb', 'hick', 'who', 'smarter', 'city', 'folk', 'innocent', 'quietly', 'intelligenct', 'city', 'folk', 'who', 'fight', 'back', 'Redneck', 'Rage', 'know', 'rich', 'taking', 'what', 'backyard', 'handled', 'such', 'generic', 'aplomb', 'was', 'certain', 'had', 'seen', 'ending', 'before', 'many', 'times', 'even', 'could', 'not', 'name', 'movie', 'top', 'head.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Cooper', 'fearful', 'submission', 'Cooper', 'usual', 'city-riche', 'liberal', 'who', 'doing', 'good', 'providing', 'local', 'ilk', 'character', 'paper', 'thin', 'Quaid', 'not', 'attempt', 'waste', 'talents', 'also', 'sort', 'emotionless', 'actor', 'improving', 'role', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'cosmopolitan', 'Leah', 'even', 'name', 'Yuppee', 'executive', 'fast', 'tracking', 'wife', 'questionable', 'ethics', 'sense', 'guilt', 'limited', 'role', 'more', 'realism', 'could', 'even', 'image', 'being', 'person', 'real', 'life', 'imagine', '.However', 'two', 'antagonists', 'are', 'horrible', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Dale', 'Dorff', 'who', 'twin', 'brother', 'similarly', 'coiffed', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'dumb', 'revengeful', 'antagonist', 'been', 'pulled', 'directly', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Handbook', 'typical', 'things', 'bad', 'guy', 'people', 'way', 'woman', 'badly', 'protagonist', 'car', 'chase', 'then', 'something', 'near', 'dear', 'protagonist', 'family', 'also', 'top', 'moment', 'end', 'movie', 'revealing', 'motives', 'hate', 'course', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'generic', 'actor', 'body', 'work', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'beginning', 'even', 'made', 'character', 'Deacon', 'Frost', 'Blade', 'generic', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'whom', 'think', 'really', 'defiencies', 'brain', 'woman', 'who', 'beaten', 'boyfriend', 'sister', 'yet', 'end', 'grave', 'show', 'love', 'pretty', 'good', 'sack', 'mean', 'movie', 'Kalifornia', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'Strange', 'Days', 'be', 'dimwit', 'role', 'Nothing', 'changes', 'here', 'Maybe', 'Figgis', 'owed', 'favor', 'put', 'role', 'sympathy', 'reason', 'existing.Anyway', 'movie', 'bust', 'even', 'favorable', 'cast', 'director', 'want', 'suspense', 'wait', 'anticipated', 'Mystic', 'River', 'save', 'hard', 'earned', 'dough', 'Rating', 'C-']",N/A

I'll be giving away every secret of the plot in order to seal this act. Of course, the movie itself gives everything away in the first ten minutes simply by existing. Cold Creek Manor insults its audience by thinking that it is ahead of us when it is so cliched that every incident is easily predicted, and often foreshadowed, often up to an hour in advance. When they are presented as surprises, you'll be wondering why, since you knew that (whatever) was going to happen long before.After an accident that lets them know that New York City is a dangerous place to live (but could have happened anywhere people are impatient with vehicles), Cooper and Leah Tilson (Dennis Quaid, Sharon Stone) buy an old mansion with a past out in the country. The locals sit around the local diner mumbling about the house but, of course, only telling the Tilsons what they need to know in order to advance the plot.Just as they are settling in, who shows up but the former owner of Cold Creek Manor (he was in prison, missed some payments, and the bank foreclosed, allowing the Tilsons to buy cheap), Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff), whose family had owned the house for generations. Now, the first clue that this guy isn't to be trusted is his family: where are they? If he was in prison, the wife could make payments, right? Oh, but not if ... but, see, you've already figured it out. The Tilsons don't, however, and hire Massie to help restore the old house, while he rummages through his old stuff that was sold with the house, including a display of skull hammers and some nudie pictures of the wife, along with photos of the many generations of Massies that Cooper, a documentarian, is using to make a film about the house.Still with me? Strange things start to happen, like poisonous snakes appearing in beds and on floors, causing the family to race up to the roof and call Dale to get them out, making him a hero in the eyes of the kids. Luckily, because Dennis Quaid is a pretty smart guy, his character figures out that Dale put the snakes in the house. Unfortunately, due to some poor career choices that have numbed her brain, Sharon Stone's character does not believe him and ends up with Juliette Lewis screaming at her, a fate I would wish on no one.Some thriller conventions just leap out, like a skylight/stained glass combination that serves no purpose but just screams to be fallen through. And characters that serve mainly to give information so they can be killed. The only bright spot in this is we get to see Christopher Plummer have a lot of fun as Massie Senior, an old, belligerent, senile man in a nursing home who has a thing for chocolate-covered cherries. The kids are all right, too, especially Jesse's (Ryan Wilson) earnest delivery of that laughable poetry. (Kristen Stewart from Panic Room plays the daughter and was nominated for Young Artist Awards for both films.)I could go on, but I don't really want to spend any more time discussing this insulting piece of cinematic waste. Mike Figgis (who made Leaving Las Vegas, so we know he can make a decent film) should be ashamed of making this film (the extras on the DVD seem to say that he is quite proud of it) and Richard Jeffries should have his computer taken away from him for lack of originality. The most ironic moment comes when, in one of the DVD extras, which covers the ""Rules of the Genre,"" Figgis points out that you must follow the rules while never allowing the audience to be ahead of the characters in the film. Editing was done in post-production to ensure that this would not happen.The most fun we had watching Cold Creek Manor was high-fiving each other when our clich&eacute; predictions came true.

They will share joyous years together and live happily ever after.Not.Actually this film has some redeeming qualities, but the hackneyed plot and the very annoying endless stupidity on the part of the yuppie couple (Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone) in the face of the behavior of the obviously up-to-no-good psychopathic villain (Stephen Dorff) made me disremember them.Bottom line: you have better things to do with your time.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",2,House from hell,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,883,"['particularly', 'egregious', 'example', 'Hollywood', 'genre', 'call', 'House', 'Hell', 'Upwardly', 'mobile', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'two', 'semi-adorable', 'kids', 'escape', 'city', 'country', 'buy', 'big', 'old', 'beautiful', 'house', 'need', 'repairs', 'will', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'fixing', 'up', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'away', 'bad', 'influences', 'dangers', 'city', 'will', 'share', 'joyous', 'years', 'together', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Not.Actually', 'film', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'very', 'annoying', 'endless', 'stupidity', 'part', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'face', 'behavior', 'obviously', 'up-to-no-good', 'psychopathic', 'villain', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'made', 'disremember', 'them.Bottom', 'line', 'have', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'time.', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",N/A

There is the family who moves to the country to get away from the hustle-bustle and the crime, there is the run-down old house they wish to turn into their dream home, and then comes along an ex-con drifter-type who used to live there.  All the ingredients for a predictable film.  Everything you could think of that could happen, does.  There is a house full of snakes, the family pet is slain, and the bad guy falls to his death through a beautiful stained-glass window.  I really didn't give the ending away, because early in the film the children are looking around the house (tresspassing, actually) when we see them open a window and look around a central shaft of the house and on the ground floor ceiling there is the multi-colored, stained-glass window.  Did the filmmakers actually think the audience was going to forget such an obvious scene?  There is also the dark and stormy night by film's end, complete with a battle on the roof.  One of my favorite scenes was when Dennis Quaid is alone in the house and he hears sombody walking toward him and there is a single low note played on the piano for the score.  Doom!  I chuckled heartily at the feeble attempt at making me scared.  Back to the rooftop.  There is the predictable scene when the killer has to give his monologue so that either help can arrive or the victim's-to-be figure out a way to thwart the dastardly dude.  When the couple are being chased through the house, lightning flashing through the windows, Sharon Stone is supposed to look terrified, but instead I thought she needed to use the bathroom. She should try the pink stuff.  She seriously overacts in more than one scene.  Dennis Quaid is passable, but only just.  The only actor worth his salt here is Stephen Dorff.  He does a subtle yet persuasive job given that his character's agenda is so predictable.  Overall, this film is pretty lame stuff.  So far this film is averaging 2 stars and the distributors are trying to sell over 130 copies at this site alone.  That should be warning enough to avoid this film.  I actually laughed more than I jumped; or I was shaking my head and looking away with a deep sigh.

789343,AGT6DON34HIIT,B0000YTOL2,"Edward P. Trimnell ""edwardtrimnell.com""","[6, 6]","For anyone who has explored the thriller genre to any extent, the premise behind Cold Creek Manor will be familiar territory. A family moves to an idyllic country home in search of a peaceful life. A charismatic, vaguely suspicious character unexpectedly enters their lives. Through a series of gradually building incidents, they come to realize that the stranger is actually a homicidal maniac. Tensions between the two sides escalate, and the family is finally forced to confront the stranger in a kill-or-be-killed battle.Cold Creek Manor doesn't fail just because it tells a story that has already been told many times. (A movie can succeed with a familiar plotline if it addresses the old story from an innovative angle.) Cold Creek Manor fails because there are simply too many credibility gaps in the movie's plot. As a result, the viewer is never able to completely suspend his or her disbelief.As I watched the movie, I found myself thinking again and again: No reasonably intelligent person would take these actions under these circumstances. In several scenes, Dennis Quaid's analytical, timid main character takes actions that are incongruently foolhardy. Moreover, there a number of places where the cause-and-effect relationships simply don't add up. (I can't be more specific without adding spoilers; but you'll recognize them if you watch the film.) For example, there is one scene where the killer has a clear chance to finish off the main characters, but he inexplicably fails to take advantage of the opportunity, in what is an obvious and artificial means of extending the action.Cold Creek Manor is also an odd mishmash of genres. The first part of the movie dwells on the sinister, gothic atmosphere of the house, leading the viewer to think that Cold Creek Manor is going to be a haunted house story of some sort. However, the atmospheric elements of the house are immaterial to the final evolution of the plot. I ultimately wondered why the director went to so much trouble to foreshadow the occult at the beginning of the film.The bright points of Cold Creek Manor are the actors. Stephen Dorff is especially skillful in his portrayal of the tough-yet-clever villain. Juliette Lewis also does a commendable job as the abused girlfriend who doesn't want to see the dark side of her love interest.I can't help thinking that there was a potential for a good movie here. However, Cold Creek Manor is far too loosely plotted to rate more than two stars, despite the competent efforts of the actors involved.",2,"Good acting, bad script",1083715200,"05 5, 2004",2004,2527,"['anyone', 'who', 'explored', 'thriller', 'genre', 'extent', 'premise', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'territory', 'family', 'idyllic', 'country', 'home', 'search', 'peaceful', 'life', 'A', 'charismatic', 'vaguely', 'suspicious', 'character', 'unexpectedly', 'lives', 'series', 'gradually', 'building', 'incidents', 'come', 'realize', 'stranger', 'actually', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'Tensions', 'two', 'sides', 'escalate', 'family', 'finally', 'forced', 'confront', 'stranger', 'kill-or-be-killed', 'battle.Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', ""n't"", 'fail', 'just', 'story', 'already', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'can', 'succeed', 'familiar', 'plotline', 'old', 'story', 'innovative', 'angle', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'credibility', 'gaps', 'movie', 'plot', 'result', 'viewer', 'never', 'able', 'completely', 'suspend', 'disbelief.As', 'watched', 'movie', 'found', 'thinking', 'again', 'again', 'No', 'reasonably', 'intelligent', 'person', 'would', 'take', 'actions', 'circumstances', 'several', 'scenes', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'analytical', 'timid', 'main', 'character', 'actions', 'are', 'incongruently', 'foolhardy', 'Moreover', 'number', 'places', 'where', 'cause-and-effect', 'relationships', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'adding', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'watch', 'film', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'killer', 'clear', 'chance', 'finish', 'off', 'main', 'characters', 'inexplicably', 'take', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'what', 'obvious', 'artificial', 'means', 'extending', 'action.Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'also', 'odd', 'mishmash', 'genres', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'sinister', 'gothic', 'atmosphere', 'house', 'leading', 'viewer', 'think', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'going', 'be', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'sort', 'However', 'atmospheric', 'elements', 'house', 'are', 'immaterial', 'final', 'evolution', 'plot', 'ultimately', 'wondered', 'why', 'director', 'went', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'foreshadow', 'occult', 'beginning', 'film.The', 'bright', 'points', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'are', 'actors', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'especially', 'skillful', 'portrayal', 'tough-yet-clever', 'villain', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'also', 'commendable', 'job', 'abused', 'girlfriend', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'dark', 'side', 'love', 'interest.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'was', 'potential', 'good', 'movie', 'here', 'However', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'far', 'too', 'loosely', 'plotted', 'rate', 'more', 'two', 'stars', 'competent', 'efforts', 'actors', 'involved']",N/A

I counted the days till it was released.Well, the only thing scary about it was my devotion to it.My devotion was not completely wasted.  I did get to see Sharon on screen again.  That was worth it, but nothing else was.Like everyone else has said, forshadowing was the key force in the movie.  Everything that was going to happen was handed to you on a silver platter many scenes before it did.  Not only was everything foretold, most of the story was completely unbelievable anyway.First off, there is this huge run down mansion out in the country.  It comes with 1200 acres and all the contents of the house, which include numerous antiques and personal family momentos.  It comes with a pool, horse stalls and what appears to be a guest house.  The house is in move in condition, but requires a bit of work.  They buy all of this for $210,000.  WHAT? In New York?  I don't think so.  It is also unbelievable that they would move from their affluent New York life to become hillbillies.  Well, maybe a little bit believable, but not very.  They also move to a place that seems to be millions of miles away from New York.  Everyone there acts like this is the first time they have seen big city people.When you first see the house and its interior, it is obvious that it was a showplace.  It is obvious that whoever lived there had money and knew how to spend and show it.  It is obvious that the family from which the house came was affluent.You then meet the last person to live in the house from the family and it is obvious that they were white trash.  They were people who would have lived in metal trailer houses with tin foil over the windows.  The house and the family do not match each other.  The house and the family are soooo mismatched it is almost ridiculous.  You are then given the idea that the others homes and land in the area are very similar to this one.  Then you see the people who live in this area and they are just as much white trash as the Massey family.  It just does not add up.The scene where there are snakes taking over the house is so overdone.  Most of the snakes look like Boas.  Since when do Boas run wild in New York?  They even have a rattlesnake.  ummm, did someone make a trip down south just to collect some snakes for this?I feel like I am rambling on now, but I just don't know how to get out everything in this movie that does not make sense.Another thing that does not work is the music.  The music makes you feel like you are watching some crime thriller from the past.  It does not work with this movie at all.There are also a few scenes that could have been scary, but they just let them float into nothing.The acting is split.  Dennis Quaid is horrible.

Still, with that being said, I expected a little more from Quaid in ""Cold Creek Manor"".  Not only did I not get it, but I got a terrible movie to boot!  ""Cold Creek Manor"" is about a family who purchases a house in the country that was in foreclosure and move into it unbeknownst to some dark secrets that reside in the hearts of the prior resident. It seems that the former owner, Dale, was in prison, and was late on some payments.  For the record, I thought that this movie was cliche-ridden and seemed to look down on people that live in the country assuming that all of them are ""trailer trash"" which is really incredibly ignorant and stereotypical of southern people and people who live in the country in general.  The truth is that there are people who live in trailers who are good people, and it's really not fair, but such is ignorance in Hollywood.Nevertheless, our redneck degenerate, Dale, is not happy that he lost his family, and he seems to be protecting something or hiding his motive.  Dennis Quaid's character was particularly bad in my opinion.  He was lifeless and lame.  Sharon Stone was not much better, and this surprised me, but this is indicative of a poor directing job in my opinion in that he did not ask too much of his actors in this film.  The actor who played Dale did the best job along with Juliet Lewis, his ""trailer-trash"" living girlfriend.Well, this movie is not scary, folks.  It's pathetic, it's boring, it's terribly done, but it is not scary or suspenseful in the slightest.  In fact, I found the plot to be unoriginal, uninspiring, insipid and very poorly executed.  This movie is very predictable with no atmosphere whatsoever, and even though Dorf did a decent job as Dale, I did not find him to be very menacing or formidable.

Big mistake.What neither of the Tilsons realize is that the newly contracted employee is the previous owner of the residence and urgently wishes to regain a foothold.Sure, he wouldn't mind the company of a few female servants, i.e. Cooper's wife and daughter (Kristen Stewart), but Cooper will have to pack his bags or else be guaranteed a plot in the local cemetery.What ensues is a head-to-head showdown pitting weedy househusband and callous redneck.Take a guess as to who will topple the other for outright supremacy.

One lame jump that happens after you completly sink into stupidity.Sharon Stone and Dennis Quaid were average with their roles. The real stars were Juliette Lewis and Stephen Dorff. Stephen Dorff perfectly embodies a crazed man who deperately wants his house back. Juliette Lewis is amazing as his ... girlfriend who keeps you begging for her presence to continue endlessly.Cold Creek Manor tells the story of a couple who find that the city is destroying their lives and the lives of their children. One day they go searching for a home and stumble upon a fenced mansion, whose gate happens to open. They go inside the house and look around. A policewoman finds them and tells them they have to leave because they are tresspassing and if they go now she won't get them in trouble. They leave, but eventually buy the house. Dennis Quaid, who plays a documentary filmmaker, finds the previous occupants whole family history and decides this will be his next film, the story of Cold Creek Manor.One day Stephen Dorff comes wandering through the house and Quaids sons tells. They ask what he is doing and he explains that it was his house and he lost it due to late payments. Later, Dennis and Sharon are talking about redesigning and Dorff asks if they'll hire him to help since he knows the place best. They hire him. Soon things begin to turn crazy as Dorff shows signs that he wants the house that belongs to him and he'll do anything to get them out.

I mean, it's not a perfect movie, but I liked it a lot better than most of the trash that was released this year (Matrix Reloaded, Fighting Temptations, X-Men 2, etc). At least Cold Creak Manor had an excellent cast, including two of my favorite actors - Sharon Stone and Dennis Quaid. I'm happy to see Sharon Stone back on the silver screen - I've really missed her and glad she is doing okay after her stroke. Her performance is great - the emotions of fear she goes through recall the silent movie queen style of Joan Crawford in Sudden Fear.  As for Dennis Quaid, he is always a great and sensitive actor. I'm glad he is choosing to star with the best actresses in the business - Julianne Moore (Far From Heaven) and Sharon Stone.As for the film, it was a lot of fun! It was suspenseful and scary and was overall very entertaining. This film has basically suffered the same fate of Jessica Lange's Hush a few years ago - slightly flawed, but vastly underrated!

789362,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B0000YTOL2,Joker,"[2, 2]","I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie rather than going into heavy detail about the plot...Cold Creek Manor (2003) is a psychological horror movie that, when I was watching it, made me think of a movie such as Cape Fear.  A psycho guy is terrorizing a family.  This movie has elements of other horror movies mixed in as well.  This movie stars Sharon Stone, Dennis Quaid, Juliette Lewis, Stephen Dorff, Kristen Stewart, and Christopher Plummer.  It's pretty much an all-star cast.  The acting overall is pretty good, but I think Juliette Lewis and Kristen Stewart were the best actors.  Dennis Quaid was so-so.  The main problem with this movie is the large number of plot holes.  If you care to watch this movie, you'll see what I mean.  These plot holes will jump out at you.  I don't want to give away what they are.  No spoilers here.  Trust me - you'll be scratching your head and thinking, ""Did that person just say what I think they did?"", or, ""I can't believe this is happening, because it doesn't make sense"", or, ""You've got to be kidding me.""  But, I guess when it comes to thrillers and horror movies, plot holes can be forgiven.  However, I have a tougher time forgiving this movie's plot holes.  Maybe it's because it had a big budget and big stars.  Well, even big budget movies with big names can be subpar.The musical score by Mike Figgis is fair.  Sometimes the music is a little cheesy sounding during exciting or suspenseful parts of the movie.  The ending of the movie isn't bad.  However, I found this movie SOOOOOO predictable.  I was sitting there predicting what would happen, and sure enough all my predictions came true.The villain in this movie is a low-life redneck who's an ex-con, played by Stephen Dorff.  Dorff plays the part well.  The lead heroic characters (Quaid and Stone) to me come off as kind of stupid people who lack intelligence and common sense.  This movie definitely had potential, but the ridiculous plot holes and stupidity of the lead characters bring it down.I can't give this movie a full recommendation, but if you're willing to take a chance on it as I did, you might feel like it was worthwhile.",3,It had potential,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,2161,"['just', 'want', 'give', 'few', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'rather', 'going', 'heavy', 'detail', 'plot', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', '2003', 'psychological', 'horror', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'made', 'think', 'movie', 'such', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'A', 'psycho', 'guy', 'terrorizing', 'family', 'movie', 'elements', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'mixed', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'pretty', 'much', 'all-star', 'cast', 'acting', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'were', 'best', 'actors', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'was', 'so-so', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'large', 'number', 'plot', 'holes', 'care', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'plot', 'holes', 'will', 'jump', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'what', 'are', 'No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'Trust', ""'ll"", 'be', 'scratching', 'head', 'thinking', 'Did', 'person', 'just', 'say', 'what', 'think', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'happening', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'guess', 'when', 'thrillers', 'horror', 'movies', 'plot', 'holes', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'However', 'have', 'tougher', 'time', 'forgiving', 'movie', 'plot', 'holes', 'Maybe', 'had', 'big', 'budget', 'big', 'stars', 'Well', 'even', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'big', 'names', 'can', 'be', 'subpar.The', 'musical', 'score', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'fair', 'music', 'little', 'cheesy', 'sounding', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'parts', 'movie', 'ending', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'However', 'found', 'movie', 'SOOOOOO', 'predictable', 'was', 'sitting', 'there', 'predicting', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'sure', 'enough', 'predictions', 'came', 'true.The', 'villain', 'movie', 'low-life', 'redneck', 'who', 'ex-con', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Dorff', 'part', 'well', 'lead', 'heroic', 'characters', 'Quaid', 'Stone', 'come', 'off', 'kind', 'stupid', 'people', 'who', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'common', 'sense', 'movie', 'definitely', 'had', 'potential', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'holes', 'stupidity', 'lead', 'characters', 'bring', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'full', 'recommendation', ""'re"", 'willing', 'take', 'chance', 'did', 'might', 'feel', 'was', 'worthwhile']",N/A

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[4, 6]","&quot;Cold Creek Manor&quot; is, simply put, a film that is intended to be a subtle psychological thriller that doesn't deliver on the thriller portion and suffers greatly from a case of predictability leaving this videophile highly disappointed given the two powerful leading actors of this film.  One would seriously think that a film starring Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone would be a highly memorable film given their storied careers in film but ultimately, this film leaves one thinking that maybe they were just looking for another paycheck.Performance wise, both Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone deliver strong performances as well as does Stephen Dorff however, their performances are severely hindered by a weak script that has more holes in it than a pound of Swiss cheese which adds to the disappointment as the potential of this film was there it just never delivers itself.  What's more surprising here is Sharon Stone taking the role in the first place as her character is more or less a weak housewife type that doesn't really show any growth throughout the film.  Given her extremely strong past performances one has to wonder why she chose to take this film on.Director Mike Figgis has had some successful films in the past and granted, he probably made the best of this film that was possible but sometimes, no matter what a director does, they cannot overcome a weak script, even with a pair of Hollywood legends.The Premise:Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone play Cooper and Leah Tilson who are trying to raise their two children in New York City but they decide for the safety of their children to move to country and they choose a dilapidated old mansion/farmhouse still filled with the belongings of the previous owners.  Not long after moving in, the former owner, Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff) shows up in the house and works his way into their lives.What follows from there is, as stated above, is a film that is billed as a tension filled psychological thriller that fails on almost every point as Dale Massie starts doing everything he can to get this family out of his house...For fans of films in this particular genre I would recommend this film as a rental only and most definitely not a purchase as one will soon be wishing they hadn't spent the money on it.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Bonus Alternate Ending-Deleted Scenes-&quot;Rules of the Genre&quot; Featurette-&quot;Cooper's Documentary&quot;-Audio Commentary with Director Mike Figgis",2,Cold Creek Manor - An undelivered psychological thriller!,1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,2467,"['quot', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'quot', 'simply', 'put', 'film', 'intended', 'be', 'subtle', 'psychological', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'thriller', 'portion', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'case', 'predictability', 'leaving', 'videophile', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'given', 'two', 'powerful', 'leading', 'actors', 'film', 'One', 'would', 'seriously', 'think', 'film', 'starring', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'would', 'be', 'highly', 'memorable', 'film', 'given', 'storied', 'careers', 'film', 'ultimately', 'film', 'one', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'were', 'just', 'looking', 'paycheck.Performance', 'wise', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'deliver', 'strong', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'however', 'performances', 'are', 'severely', 'hindered', 'weak', 'script', 'more', 'holes', 'pound', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'disappointment', 'potential', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'never', 'What', 'more', 'surprising', 'here', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'taking', 'role', 'first', 'place', 'character', 'more', 'less', 'weak', 'housewife', 'type', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'growth', 'film', 'Given', 'extremely', 'strong', 'past', 'performances', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'chose', 'take', 'film', 'on.Director', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'had', 'successful', 'films', 'past', 'granted', 'probably', 'made', 'best', 'film', 'was', 'possible', 'sometimes', 'matter', 'what', 'director', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'weak', 'script', 'even', 'pair', 'Hollywood', 'legends.The', 'Premise', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'play', 'Cooper', 'Leah', 'Tilson', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'raise', 'two', 'children', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'decide', 'safety', 'children', 'move', 'country', 'choose', 'dilapidated', 'old', 'mansion/farmhouse', 'still', 'filled', 'belongings', 'previous', 'owners', 'Not', 'long', 'moving', 'former', 'owner', 'Dale', 'Massie', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'up', 'house', 'way', 'stated', 'film', 'billed', 'tension', 'filled', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'almost', 'point', 'Dale', 'Massie', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'get', 'family', 'house', 'fans', 'films', 'particular', 'genre', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'rental', 'only', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'purchase', 'one', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'wishing', 'had', ""n't"", 'spent', 'money', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Bonus', 'Alternate', 'Ending-Deleted', 'Scenes-', 'quot', 'Rules', 'Genre', 'quot', 'Featurette-', 'quot', 'Cooper', 'Documentary', 'quot', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Figgis']",N/A
789371,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000YTOL2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 6]","For all of us who have complained about trailers that have all the best parts of the movie, not to mention end up being better than the movie itself, &quot;Cold Creek Manor&quot; is a painful reminder that there are worst things in this world.  The trailer for this 2003 film sure makes it look like this is a haunted house movie in the tradition of both schlock like &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; or classics like &quot;The Haunting of Hill House.&quot;  However, that proves not to be the case.  This is not a haunted house movie; it is one of those films where a relatively normal family crosses a psycho and he comes after them (and their little horse too).This film was directed by Mike Figgis, who also co-produced the effort.  This becomes important because wearing one of those two hats Figgis should have realized that the use of music in this film (composed by Figgis as well) is overused.  Even before you figure out what sort of movie this is you know that bad things are coming to be happening because the forboding music cues come early and often.  There is not even a pretense that when Cooper (Dennis Quaid) and Leah Tilson (Sharon Stone) move their family to the titular house out in the country that there are going to have a moment of happiness in this film.  When you check out the deleted scenes on the DVD and see the alternative ending you have to wonder what Figgis thought was happening with this film, because the reason that what ended up on the cutting room floor was wrong is still wrong with the finale, albeit on a lesser level of wrongness.Anyhow, the Tilson family, with daughter and son in tow, seek refuge from the hectic pace, high pressure, and crazy car drivers of the big bad city to find peace and quiet in the country.  They get the house known as Cold Creek Manor for a song, including all of the contents, because the former owner could no longer pay the bills.  The script by Richard Jefferies then has the Tilsons express a death wish by hiring the former owner, Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff), to help fix up the place.  He is an ex-con whose family is missing and he acts weird from the get go, but that is no reason to be suspicious because it is not like the Tilsons can hear that ominous music.  Besides, only a few of the locals warn them they are heading into trouble, so they are blithely heading towards disaster.Cooper is working on a documentary film about the Massie family because when they bought the contents of the house they got all the old family photographs, letters, and whatnot.  You think that this is going to have a really big payoff, but not really, because that honor is reserved for those big metal hammers on the wall that Dale's grandpappy made for killing a thousand sheep each year without buying all those bullets.  I sort of liked the son in this film, pretty much by default, because everybody in this film is pretty stupid and he at least had his youth in his favor.  Over and over again it seems that whatever would be the wrong thing to do, these people do it and do it with enthusiasm.  Ultimately, &quot;Cold Creek Manor&quot; has the worst quality of your standard splatter flick, where you really do not care if every single one of these characters ends up dead.  I know that Stone is trying to come back from cinematic oblivion, but Quaid just had &quot;The Rookie,&quot; so what was his excuse?",2,Two stupid city folk have an even stupider psycho after them,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,3383,"['who', 'have', 'complained', 'trailers', 'have', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'not', 'mention', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'better', 'movie', 'quot', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'quot', 'painful', 'reminder', 'are', 'worst', 'things', 'world', 'trailer', '2003', 'film', 'sure', 'look', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'tradition', 'schlock', 'quot', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'quot', 'classics', 'quot', 'Haunting', 'Hill', 'House.', 'quot', 'However', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'not', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'relatively', 'normal', 'family', 'psycho', 'little', 'horse', 'too', '.This', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'who', 'also', 'co-produced', 'effort', 'important', 'wearing', 'one', 'two', 'hats', 'Figgis', 'should', 'have', 'realized', 'use', 'music', 'film', 'composed', 'Figgis', 'as', 'well', 'overused', 'Even', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'sort', 'movie', 'know', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'coming', 'be', 'happening', 'forboding', 'music', 'come', 'early', 'often', 'not', 'even', 'pretense', 'when', 'Cooper', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Leah', 'Tilson', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'move', 'family', 'titular', 'house', 'country', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'moment', 'happiness', 'film', 'When', 'check', 'out', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'see', 'alternative', 'ending', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'Figgis', 'thought', 'was', 'happening', 'film', 'reason', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'was', 'wrong', 'still', 'wrong', 'finale', 'albeit', 'lesser', 'level', 'wrongness.Anyhow', 'Tilson', 'family', 'daughter', 'son', 'tow', 'seek', 'refuge', 'hectic', 'pace', 'high', 'pressure', 'crazy', 'car', 'drivers', 'big', 'bad', 'city', 'find', 'peace', 'quiet', 'country', 'get', 'house', 'known', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'song', 'including', 'contents', 'former', 'owner', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'pay', 'bills', 'script', 'Richard', 'Jefferies', 'then', 'Tilsons', 'express', 'death', 'wish', 'hiring', 'former', 'owner', 'Dale', 'Massie', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'help', 'fix', 'up', 'place', 'ex-con', 'family', 'missing', 'weird', 'get', 'go', 'reason', 'be', 'suspicious', 'not', 'Tilsons', 'can', 'hear', 'ominous', 'music', 'Besides', 'only', 'few', 'locals', 'warn', 'are', 'heading', 'trouble', 'are', 'blithely', 'heading', 'towards', 'disaster.Cooper', 'working', 'documentary', 'film', 'Massie', 'family', 'when', 'bought', 'contents', 'house', 'got', 'old', 'family', 'photographs', 'letters', 'whatnot', 'think', 'going', 'have', 'really', 'big', 'payoff', 'not', 'really', 'honor', 'reserved', 'big', 'metal', 'hammers', 'wall', 'Dale', 'grandpappy', 'made', 'killing', 'thousand', 'sheep', 'year', 'buying', 'bullets', 'sort', 'liked', 'son', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'default', 'everybody', 'film', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'least', 'had', 'youth', 'favor', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'thing', 'do', 'people', 'do', 'do', 'enthusiasm', 'Ultimately', 'quot', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'quot', 'worst', 'quality', 'standard', 'splatter', 'flick', 'where', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'single', 'one', 'characters', 'up', 'dead', 'know', 'Stone', 'trying', 'come', 'back', 'cinematic', 'oblivion', 'Quaid', 'just', 'had', 'quot', 'Rookie', 'quot', 'what', 'was', 'excuse']",N/A

As the movie went on, I noticed that the direction was bad, and I also noticed that the music was lousy. During the credits I was surprised to see that the music was composed by the director. One of few good things in this movie was Dennis Quaid's face.I enjoyed the snakes not because I thought it was good movie making, but because it had my wife squirming in her seat. I give the movie a point for that, but other than that the snakes thing was weak. Like ok, the snakes got into the house but they were all discovered simultaneously???I'll admit that I haven't scene many slasher movies, but could this be the first or one of few movies that has a scream track? I was amazed and horrified to hear a scream track, and very obvious too, with some screams even misplaced where there was not a corresponding orchestra hit and the movie was not that startling.Most of the scare value of this movie is in spook-house style startles, which I personally find distasteful. For example, ""Alien,"" an excellent and classic movie, only uses one startle where they find Mr. Jones, just for comic effect. Other than that Ridley Scott relies on skillful suspense to carry ""Alien"" to great effect. Worse, in ""Cold Creek Manor"" I even predicted several of the startles. I only got surprised when in a certain situation I expected a startle-oops surprise, there was not one there but in a few minutes a different character was in that situation and boom, there it was. The biggest jump I got was because there was a defect in the film that I was watching and it made some light come that looked like lightning bolts, and I jumped. Sadly, it was just a celluloid dropout.Some threads did not go anywhere. For example the thread of the nude pictures went nowhere. The thread of the sheriff being the sister went nowhere, even the major thread of the girlfriend went nowhere.I did enjoy Christopher Plummer's performance even if his dialogue was ludicrous, though it was quite funny.The production values on this movie, other than the plot, music, and direction were good, but the film borders on the ""so bad it's funny.""",2,"Lousy movie, lousy music, and scream track???",1064102400,"09 21, 2003",2003,2235,"['Just', 'Signs', 'guessed', 'entire', 'plot', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'plot', 'thickens', 'point', 'came', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'movie', 'went', 'noticed', 'direction', 'was', 'bad', 'also', 'noticed', 'music', 'was', 'lousy', 'credits', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'music', 'was', 'composed', 'director', 'One', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'was', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'face.I', 'enjoyed', 'snakes', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'making', 'had', 'wife', 'squirming', 'seat', 'give', 'movie', 'point', 'other', 'snakes', 'thing', 'was', 'weak', 'ok', 'snakes', 'got', 'house', 'were', 'discovered', 'simultaneously', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'scene', 'many', 'slasher', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'first', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'scream', 'track', 'was', 'amazed', 'horrified', 'hear', 'scream', 'track', 'very', 'obvious', 'too', 'screams', 'even', 'misplaced', 'where', 'was', 'not', 'corresponding', 'orchestra', 'hit', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'startling.Most', 'scare', 'value', 'movie', 'spook-house', 'style', 'startles', 'personally', 'find', 'distasteful', 'example', 'Alien', 'excellent', 'classic', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'startle', 'where', 'find', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'just', 'comic', 'effect', 'Other', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'relies', 'skillful', 'suspense', 'carry', 'Alien', 'great', 'effect', 'Worse', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'even', 'predicted', 'several', 'startles', 'only', 'got', 'surprised', 'when', 'certain', 'situation', 'expected', 'startle-oops', 'surprise', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'few', 'minutes', 'different', 'character', 'was', 'situation', 'boom', 'was', 'biggest', 'jump', 'got', 'was', 'was', 'defect', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'made', 'light', 'come', 'looked', 'lightning', 'bolts', 'jumped', 'Sadly', 'was', 'just', 'celluloid', 'dropout.Some', 'threads', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'anywhere', 'example', 'thread', 'nude', 'pictures', 'went', 'nowhere', 'thread', 'sheriff', 'being', 'sister', 'went', 'nowhere', 'even', 'major', 'thread', 'girlfriend', 'went', 'nowhere.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'performance', 'even', 'dialogue', 'was', 'ludicrous', 'was', 'quite', 'funny.The', 'production', 'values', 'movie', 'other', 'plot', 'music', 'direction', 'were', 'good', 'film', 'borders', 'so', 'bad', 'funny']",N/A
789373,A3OTY02A4YTBJ4,B0000YTOL2,L. Davis,"[0, 0]","This movie was a real disapointment especially since it was directed by Mike Figgis who was the director of Leaving Las Vegas. Is Figgis relegated to B and C movies now that he is no longer a Scientologist? This movie is so bad it's not even funny. This movie tries really hard to be ""Cape Fear"". Dennis Quaid is no Nick Nolte/Gregory Peck and Dorff is no Robert Mitchum/Robert De Niro. Dorff has got to be the worst actor ever. I don't even remember him in other movies. I could beleive this was a Lifetime movie but it was a movie at the theaters. OMG! As to how they got financiing for this movie I cannot even guess. They must have been going on Figgis's reputation. The screenplay for this movie is terrible. You could cut several scenes from this movie and it would still be the same, you wouldn't miss anything because it makes absolutely no sense.The premise of the movie is that an upper class New York family comes upon a dilapidated house. The house is totally gross and creepy. But hello! They decide to buy it. They don't even wait until the renovations of the house are completed but move in a month later. The house is totally gross, who in their right mind would move into a home that is dilapidated with holes in the walls, rotting ceilings, and renovation that will take 2 years to complete? For one thing, the characteristics of the the previous owners make no sense. These people talk like they are from the South but we have no idea where they are at. Christopher Plummer has an accent of an English manor owner but then his son Dorff sounds like he just got off the set of ""Deliverance"". Christopher Plummer sounds more like Clark Gable's father in Gone with the Wind than Dorff's Deliverance father. The family are doing well in their new house and make friends with the owners of a restuarant/7 eleven store. But lo and behold, Dorff appears. He's creepy, stinky, dirty, disgusting looking and he just got out of jail. He trespasses onto the house and guess what, Quaid decides to let him have a job renovating the house. Drum roll please! You can guess what happens next. Dorff starts harassing the family with hijinx but Quaid doesn't have enough evidence to get him carted to jail. Get this: Juliette Lewis's character who plays Dorffs girldfriend, gets punched in the face in the bar in front of everyone including the only law enforcement officer, who is a woman (What white trash town would have a woman for a police officer?), the policewoman starts to arrest Dorff but then Lewis says she fell down even though every one saw it happen including Quaid and the police woman. The police woman doesn't arrest Dorff because Lewis won't testify against him even though everyone including the police woman saw Dorff punch Lewis. It makes no sense! And it's really maddening to watch. Does Dorff pay off this police woman with hidden cash or something? No, the guy looks like he doesn't have a dime. Anyway, there's a mystery to the movie which involves Dorff and Plummer that Quaid/Stone investigates which leads to a confrontation between Quaid/Stone and Dorff which is the climax of the movie. Lewis doesn't have much of a role except as a white trash bartender who lives in a silver bullet trailer and gets knocked around by Dorff. Her role is to inform us of how mean Dorff is.I watched this movie on cable and my husband and I heckled this movie while we were surfing the internet and eating breakfast. The information for this movie on the cable channel made it sound like it was a haunted house movie. I feel mislead by the promotion of the this movie. The distributing company probably thought a Cape Fear promotion wouldn't work for this movie.  I think if they would have made Dorff's character like a very elegant Gone with the Wind perhaps it would have been more interesting. But to make him from Deliverance is really annoying. It seems like screenwriters are thinking ""If you want to make a bad guy, make him white trash.""This movie tries to be too many things. It tries to be a haunted house movie, a mystery movie, and a Cape Fear movie except the screenplay is worthless and the actors have terrible lines. I feel sorry for them especially since Christopher Plummer is such a good actor. It's hard to beleive Quaid was an '80's star and Stone was a '90's star with their acting in this movie. My husband said Figgis must have made this movie as a joke. Maybe he felt he was getting back at Hubbard or Cruise.This movie gets one star for terrible screenplay, direction, acting, and photography.",1,Not a horror/thriller but a flop,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,4536,"['movie', 'was', 'real', 'disapointment', 'especially', 'was', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'who', 'was', 'director', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Figgis', 'relegated', 'B', 'C', 'movies', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'Scientologist', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'not', 'even', 'funny', 'movie', 'really', 'hard', 'be', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Nick', 'Nolte/Gregory', 'Peck', 'Dorff', 'Robert', 'Mitchum/Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Dorff', 'got', 'be', 'worst', 'actor', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'other', 'movies', 'could', 'beleive', 'was', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'was', 'movie', 'theaters', 'OMG', 'how', 'got', 'financiing', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'guess', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'Figgis', 'reputation', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'terrible', 'could', 'cut', 'several', 'scenes', 'movie', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'same', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'absolutely', 'sense.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'upper', 'class', 'New', 'York', 'family', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'house', 'totally', 'gross', 'creepy', 'hello', 'decide', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'wait', 'renovations', 'house', 'are', 'completed', 'move', 'month', 'later', 'house', 'totally', 'gross', 'who', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'move', 'home', 'dilapidated', 'holes', 'walls', 'rotting', 'ceilings', 'renovation', 'will', 'take', '2', 'years', 'complete', 'one', 'thing', 'characteristics', 'previous', 'owners', 'make', 'sense', 'people', 'talk', 'are', 'South', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'are', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'accent', 'English', 'manor', 'owner', 'then', 'son', 'Dorff', 'just', 'got', 'off', 'set', 'Deliverance', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'more', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'father', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Dorff', 'Deliverance', 'father', 'family', 'are', 'doing', 'well', 'new', 'house', 'make', 'friends', 'owners', 'restuarant/7', 'eleven', 'store', 'lo', 'behold', 'Dorff', 'creepy', 'stinky', 'dirty', 'disgusting', 'looking', 'just', 'got', 'jail', 'house', 'guess', 'what', 'Quaid', 'let', 'have', 'job', 'renovating', 'house', 'Drum', 'roll', 'please', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'Dorff', 'harassing', 'family', 'hijinx', 'Quaid', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'evidence', 'get', 'carted', 'jail', 'Get', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'character', 'who', 'Dorffs', 'girldfriend', 'punched', 'face', 'bar', 'front', 'everyone', 'including', 'only', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'who', 'woman', 'What', 'white', 'trash', 'town', 'would', 'have', 'woman', 'police', 'officer', 'policewoman', 'arrest', 'Dorff', 'then', 'Lewis', 'fell', 'down', 'even', 'one', 'saw', 'happen', 'including', 'Quaid', 'police', 'woman', 'police', 'woman', ""n't"", 'arrest', 'Dorff', 'Lewis', 'wo', ""n't"", 'testify', 'even', 'everyone', 'including', 'police', 'woman', 'saw', 'Dorff', 'punch', 'Lewis', 'sense', 'really', 'maddening', 'watch', 'Does', 'Dorff', 'pay', 'off', 'police', 'woman', 'hidden', 'cash', 'something', 'No', 'guy', ""n't"", 'have', 'dime', 'Anyway', 'mystery', 'movie', 'Dorff', 'Plummer', 'Quaid/Stone', 'confrontation', 'Quaid/Stone', 'Dorff', 'climax', 'movie', 'Lewis', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'role', 'white', 'trash', 'bartender', 'who', 'silver', 'bullet', 'trailer', 'knocked', 'Dorff', 'role', 'inform', 'how', 'mean', 'Dorff', 'is.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'cable', 'husband', 'heckled', 'movie', 'were', 'surfing', 'internet', 'eating', 'breakfast', 'information', 'movie', 'cable', 'channel', 'made', 'was', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'feel', 'mislead', 'promotion', 'movie', 'distributing', 'company', 'probably', 'thought', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'promotion', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Dorff', 'character', 'very', 'elegant', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'make', 'Deliverance', 'really', 'annoying', 'screenwriters', 'are', 'thinking', 'want', 'make', 'bad', 'guy', 'make', 'white', 'trash', 'movie', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'be', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'mystery', 'movie', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'worthless', 'actors', 'have', 'terrible', 'lines', 'feel', 'sorry', 'especially', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'hard', 'beleive', 'Quaid', 'was', ""'80"", 'star', 'Stone', 'was', ""'90"", 'star', 'acting', 'movie', 'husband', 'said', 'Figgis', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'joke', 'Maybe', 'felt', 'was', 'getting', 'back', 'Hubbard', 'Cruise.This', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'terrible', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'acting', 'photography']",N/A

I hoped I was in for a good scare.  And the title  - you gotta admit ""Cold Creek Manor"" is one that promises at least a few chills and thrills in a dark theater.  Best of all, it had two well-known actors in the lead.  ""Sharon Stone, huh.  Haven't seen her in anything for a while.  Looking forward to it.  Dennis Quaid is decent, too.""No such luck.  It took a long time to get over the shame and teasing I suffered from choosing this bomb.  It is incredulously bad.  How?  Who paid for this bomb?  CCM is one of the worst movies of all time.  The story is about a couple and their children who move to the country to escape city life.  Almost instantly they meet up with a local yokel Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff), who insinuates his way into their house and their lives, burping rudely all the way.  The house once belonged to his family, but they lost it because of hard times.  Dale is unwilling to let Cold Creek Manor go, and hires himself on as a handyman.  It is mystifying that this couple we assume to be reasonably intelligent  would let their compassionate guilt  completely override their survival instict.  Hello, you have two KIDS!!!!  Dale becomes increasingly creepy, while the couple becomes increasingly timid.  A very good character and performance is turned in by Christopher Plummer as Mr. Massie, Dale's incapacitated but powerful father.The movie gets pretty funny as it tries to get scary.  The scariest scene involving lots of varieties of snakes popping out of the walls as the family runs screaming around the house had everyone in the theater rolling on the floor with laughter.

789377,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0000YTOL2,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 2]","This highly derivative thriller offers little to a fan of this genre.  The movie is often predictable with only a few moments of chills.  Many of the intended chills are boring and even occasionally laughable.  Furthermore, plot holes abound and by the end of the movie you finally hope for it all to end rather than for any plot resolution.Cooper Tilson (Dennis Quaid) and Leah Tilson (Sharon Stone) live in New York City.  Leah has a serious shot at an executive position, with the drawback that her boss is pushing for her to sleep with him.  While Leah is on a business trip, Cooper attempts to get the kids off to school.  His city-raised son manages to nearly get run over on the way to school, and Cooper decides it's time to pack up the family and move to the sticks, in this case upstate New York.Cooper and family soon locate a run-down mansion on hundreds of acres and decide it's perfect.  Unfortunately, the house has a psychopathic former owner, Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff), just out of prison determining he'll get the family property back.  While we are briefly misled by Dale's visit to his father, played by Christopher Plummer, we soon find that Dale has a very big reason for regaining his former home.Unfortunately, the real moments of suspense and tension in this movie are too few to hold a viewer's attention.  Dale's moves are generally predictable, and his appearances are more tedious than threatening.  The plot plods along too slowly, and the ending can be seen coming long before it arrives.  Avoid this movie and get the much scarier ""The Ring"" or ""The Stir of Echoes.""This movie was needless.  The trailers were more exciting than the movie, and I can't even recommend this movie as a rental.

It doesn't go that direction nor ever intends to. Instead, go in expecting a movie that features a more psychological bent and you'll enjoy it more.The film begins in New York where yuppie couple Cooper and Leah Tilson (Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone) have decided that they need to lose the rat race and the destructive properties of the big city. She takes a sabbatical from work (where she was just offered a promotion by an exec looking to bed her) and he continues his work as a documentary film maker.Where they do this is in a small town where they pick up a huge house called Cold Creek Manor for next to nothing due to a foreclosure. Along with their two kids, they move in, selling off the apparently abandoned belongings and beginning restoration work on the battered home. Among these items, Quaid comes across a number of things that relate to the house and its previous occupants. Ever the inquisitive researcher, he begins to look into the history of the house and its owners.One day they find a young man in the house who claims to be one of these past owners. Dale Massie (Stephen Dorf) seems a bit rough around the edges, exhibiting terrible table manners. He lets them know he's been in prison for 3 years and asks if he can get a job working on restoring the house. They agree and all goes well. At first.Odd things begin to happen and Cooper begins to feel a bit jealous at what he perceives to be a flirtatious behavior exhibited by Dale towards his wife. In his research, he tracks down Dale's father to a rest home and finds more about Dale. When the house is over run by snakes, Cooper believes it to be the work of Dale and fires him.This sets off a chain reaction. Dale turns out to be the town tough guy, not quite respected by the locals but intimidating enough to have them stay out of his way. Dale also has a secret that his hid well for a number of years. One that may lead to the Tilson's finding themselves in grievous danger.Before we got to this point, and after having viewed perhaps far too many mysteries, I figured out what that secret was. And that Dale would do anything to prevent anyone from discovering it.As I sit here a day later, thinking back on this film, I realize more about it than I did when I first left the theater. Thinking back, I find that there wasn't a character that I related well too. There was no one that I sympathized with nor that drew me in enough to care for. And that is one of the linchpins that holds a movie like this together. You have to care so much about the victims that you hate seeing anything happen to them.  I never seemed to feel that while watching this movie.And the suspense just wasn't there either. At least not enough so. Everything felt predictable to me. I kept thinking see that? This will happen next. And it did. And for a movie that is supposed to be full of suspense that just doesn't cut it. The set ups to look for later as the film progresses are all blatantly obvious to the viewer. Too much so.In the long run, the movie isn't bad. It's just not as good as it should have been. I'd love to say that the performances were well done. But the fact that I never felt drawn in to care more than I did for the characters says that that wasn't the case. If there's little else on or you don't like what else is showing, you might enjoy this one.

789380,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0000YTOL2,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[2, 2]","Cold Creek Manor is as cliched as they get. A near accident forces NYC family to move to peaceful, idyllic suburbia. They move into the 'perfect' house, which has its share of not so perfect secrets. From there, it gets all the more predictable. So why didn't I hate this movie? The cast for one. Dennis Quaid was pretty good as the patriarch, and it was great seeing Sharon Stone back on the big screen in a very different role for her as mother. Stephen Dorff was very creepy and effective as the bad guy, and Juliette Lewis played the town slut to perfection.Acclaimed director Mike Figgis did his best with the lackluster script, and wrote a pretty brilliant score to the film, which added to the creepiness. And while it was evident where the film was headed, the suspense did manage to build, slowly but surely. Perhaps some tight editing would have benefited the film since the audience knows what to expect and taking two hours to reach that point is quite ridiculous. However, there are some pretty terrific scenes which lead to a decent finale.There is a tremendously long and unbearable deleted scene on the DVD I'm glad was removed. It was a15 minute scene of Quaid and Dorff playing a game of pool, which added nothing to the film. Had that been included, I might have hated this. And while the film ties things together nicely with it's an oh so perfect happy ending, the deleted alternate ending was far superior and more in the style of Mike Figgis. I think the film would have gotten an extra star with that ending in tact instead.Overall, the film is overlong and cliched, but made fun nonetheless by the terrific cast and the director who knows how to work with his actors. It manages to be suspenseful without being a nail-biter.

The parents with two kids flee the dangerous life of New York City and buy a huge mansion in the woods full of the original owners belongings.  They are greeted by the former owner ex-con (Dorff) who is instantly evil and unlikable (overacted).  He wants his house back, but Quaid and Stone aren't smart enough to get a restraining order on him.  They are too nice, so they hire him! Then there is an absolutely preposterous scene where snakes suddenly appear everywhere all at once.  It's orchestrated like a cartoon and Sharon Stone just screams like she's taking screaming lessons.  It's really bad.  So the point of the rest of the movie is fairly well a moot point.  There's lots of threatening.  There's a mystery sign in the woods that begs to be lifted, but Stone forgets.  Juliette Lewis plays the white trash girlfriend (again) to Dorff.  Dorff rolls his eyes and gets drunk a lot.  Quaid won't leave.  Stone won't leave.  The kids want to leave (smart).  Dorff has a chase scene with Quaid.  Stone falls into a mystery hole, but gets out.  A lightning storm appears at just the right time.  It's just so dumb.  However, if you want a finale that really, really stretches the imagination, check this out.  The new owners get their revenge in a truly inventive way.

Unfortunately it just does not quite connect in all the right places to make it a classic.  I like to use the word classic because I am always looking for a film that will leave an impression on me, and one people will be talking about around the water cooler years from now.For starters, it would take a great effort to boost a film like this up out of the tank because there have been a great deal of films like this produced and released, whether theatrical or just to DVD in the past few years.  An old house, a new family and a secret past waiting to be revealed to the unsuspecting tenants is nothing new.  In fact, it is getting quite old, so somewhere in the story there has to be a couple of great scenes or a really good plot twist.There really isn't, but the fact Quaid and Stone are in it help give it a more professional feel than most that are like it.  Stephen Dorff plays the part of Dale Massie, a local hood complete with white t-shirt and long bangs who has been in jail for a spell.  The home belonged to Massie and now he wants it back, but there are other strange things going on that lead you to believe there may be more going on in the background with the history of the old dwelling.Dorff does a great job of being the young bad boy who seems to be catching the eye of Tilson's wife (Stone) and in the end there are some great scenes of revealing truth.

It's nothing that no other thriller hasn't already given us, except with this, we get Sharon Stone, who can't crack a smile, and the adrogynous little girl who was also in Panic Room, and a very obvious reference to the Ring movies. So obvious I got it.BUT on the other hand we get the downright lovely Stephen Dorff (now more famous for his romance with Pamela Anderson), get that fag out your mouth, and a rather surprising performance from Christopher Plummer. I thought this guy was old in Sound Of Music. Well, he's even older now, unrecognisable under that white beard, but gives a really good, memorable performance, despite the little screen time he gets.It's obvious a lot of this movie was cut, as there's a lot of subplots that are still left in, but not given much screen time as originally. The subplot with the topless photos of Sharon Stone - what the hell was that all about? Was she having affair? She admitted she nearly slept with her boss to get that big job, but didn't. And there wasn't going to be a romance between her & Stephen Dorff's character, although it was implied, but it was very subtle. It would have been interesting to see more scenes with Dennis Quaid messing around with the old family photos & everything, I thought the film was going to lead in a whole different direction with that, but it didn't. There was no point of the children being there, they could have easily done the whole movie without the children. The girl was there to be angry with the dad, the boy was there as an excuse to get out of the city and into the country.Juliette Lewis, now trying to be a singer, with her band Juliette & The Licks, does show her age a wee bit in this film, there's always something not quite right. She's not your stereotypical beautiful woman, but she's sexy, and she can work it. At least she's decided that long hair looks a lot better.There also seems to be huge chunks of time missing. One minute the girl is grumpy to be seen hanging around with the other girl with the pony, the next minute she's got her very own pony. There's obviously a lot of time gone missing between Stephen Dorff's character going to work on the pool, and the pool being completed, but for more obvious reasons.If you're new to thriller movies, then this is the one to rent/buy, but if you're an old hand at these kind of things, then pass by, unless you really fancy it.And I definitely prefer Dennis Quaid.

Dennis Quaid does a little bit of overacting, and at times, underacting.  Some of his facial expressions are way overboard, and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of synergy in his performance.  Sharon Stone looks well, but her character seems to react more than act.  Stephen Dorff is excellent as the demented Dale Massie, smooth, but with a smoldering evil boiling underneath.  Juliette Lewis does well as Dale's love, and an unrecognizable Christopher Plummer hams it up as the senile Massie's father.  There are some tense and chilling moments, but it's pacing is so slow in the beginning, you wonder where Figgis is taking the film.  I like Quaid very much, but was disappointed in his performance in this movie.  The extras are interesting, including one called &quot;Rules of the Genre&quot; in which director Figgis tries to explain those rules for a thriller; unfortunately, I don't think he followed them.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","Cold Creek Manor is yet another entry in the psycho-in-your-home thrillers that have been bedeviling movies since Fear and Cape Fear. To wit, the blue collar bad guy, who has a complicated past with the white collar protagonist, uses the rules of civilized society to insert himself into our hero's home.  It's then a cat and mouse game that ultimately erupts into violence as the family man must reassert himself as an alpha dog and protect his family.This kind of plot is extremely challenging for a couple of reasons.  For one, the villain needs a compelling reason for going through all the effort of stalking the family besides ""just being crazy.""  Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff) is just plain nuts.  Sure, he has a dark past tied to the property, but wouldn't it make more sense to just leave town than to stalk a family?For another, the heroes need a compelling reason to stay. Documentarian husband Cooper Tillson (Dennis Quaid) and business executive wife Leah (Sharon Stone, curiously washed out here) are city-folks displaced from New York who apparently have no idea how to survive anywhere else.  When Leah justifiably begs to leave, Cooper exclaims that they have nowhere else to go - and then promptly sends Leah and their two kids (including Kristen Stewart as...Kristen) to a friend's house for their own safety.Finally, there needs to be some legal reasons binding everyone together.  The drama involved in a blue collar foe threatening a white collar hero is his cunning; he knows how to use the system to his own ends, usually because he's been caught once already.  Massie has already served time, but he learned nothing during his incarceration.  Instead of hiding behind the law, he regularly flouts it, at one point starting a bar brawl and punching his girlfriend in the face in public - who just happens to be the sister of the local sheriff.  Massie seems to be begging to be arrested again.Without any reasonable motivation for the villain, a smart couple whose helplessness is curiously contrived, and a justice system that is unbelievably incompetent, Cold Creek Manor runs out of tricks fast. There are no surprises, because the movie wears its twisted heart on its sleeve - the film begins and ends exactly as we expect. Cooper, in what can only be described as plot-induced momentary insanity, HIRES Massie to fix up the house.  It robs Cooper of the audience's sympathy -- most reasonable people wouldn't hire the ex-con who was evicted from your new home. When it becomes clear that Massie's kind of a creep, Cooper's getting what he deserves.And for sitting through the entire movie...so do we.",2,Plot-induced insanity,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2627,"['Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'yet', 'entry', 'psycho-in-your-home', 'thrillers', 'have', 'been', 'bedeviling', 'movies', 'Fear', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'wit', 'blue', 'collar', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'complicated', 'past', 'white', 'collar', 'protagonist', 'rules', 'civilized', 'society', 'insert', 'hero', 'home', 'then', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'ultimately', 'violence', 'family', 'man', 'must', 'reassert', 'alpha', 'dog', 'protect', 'family.This', 'kind', 'plot', 'extremely', 'challenging', 'couple', 'reasons', 'one', 'villain', 'compelling', 'reason', 'going', 'effort', 'stalking', 'family', 'just', 'being', 'crazy', 'Dale', 'Massie', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'just', 'plain', 'nuts', 'Sure', 'dark', 'past', 'tied', 'property', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'just', 'leave', 'town', 'stalk', 'family', 'heroes', 'need', 'compelling', 'reason', 'stay', 'Documentarian', 'husband', 'Cooper', 'Tillson', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'business', 'executive', 'wife', 'Leah', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'curiously', 'washed', 'here', 'are', 'city-folks', 'displaced', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'apparently', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'survive', 'anywhere', 'else', 'When', 'Leah', 'justifiably', 'leave', 'Cooper', 'have', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'then', 'promptly', 'Leah', 'two', 'kids', 'including', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Kristen', 'friend', 'house', 'own', 'safety.Finally', 'be', 'legal', 'reasons', 'binding', 'everyone', 'together', 'drama', 'involved', 'blue', 'collar', 'foe', 'threatening', 'white', 'collar', 'hero', 'cunning', 'how', 'use', 'system', 'own', 'ends', 'usually', 'been', 'caught', 'once', 'already', 'Massie', 'already', 'served', 'time', 'learned', 'nothing', 'incarceration', 'Instead', 'hiding', 'law', 'regularly', 'one', 'point', 'starting', 'bar', 'brawl', 'punching', 'girlfriend', 'face', 'public', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'sister', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Massie', 'be', 'begging', 'be', 'arrested', 'reasonable', 'motivation', 'villain', 'smart', 'couple', 'helplessness', 'curiously', 'contrived', 'justice', 'system', 'unbelievably', 'incompetent', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'tricks', 'fast', 'are', 'surprises', 'movie', 'twisted', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'film', 'exactly', 'expect', 'Cooper', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'plot-induced', 'momentary', 'insanity', 'HIRES', 'Massie', 'fix', 'up', 'house', 'Cooper', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'most', 'reasonable', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'hire', 'ex-con', 'who', 'was', 'evicted', 'new', 'home', 'When', 'clear', 'Massie', 'kind', 'creep', 'Cooper', 'getting', 'what', 'sitting', 'entire', 'movie', 'so', 'do']",N/A

Some see him as a visionary and original filmmaker, with a language bordering on the existential, while others consider him a pretentious and over indulgent director (mainly with the above mentioned films)..I seem to think of him as a bit of both..For the director of the excellent Stormy Monday and Leaving Ls Vegas, can also baffle me with films like Hotel with its overbearing style, digital experimentations, and the ubiquitous and rather annoying multi screens that he seems to love so much.So with Cold Creek Manor, I expected Figgis to be back in form after the break he had in 'art'land , and I must say that I was sorely disappointed.It is not because the film is bad in itself..it is simply because I expected much more from Figgis and from his film . The problem with Cold Creek Manor is straightforward:it is bland, colorless and as thrilling as the countless straight to video/dvd thrillers that litter the market.It does not add anything to the genre, in terms of plot or directing style, and I expected throughout the film something to happen, or a nice twist at the end that would make the 112 minutes worthwhile, but unfortunately it was not meant to be.A family escapes the city to the country and buys an estate that was repossessed by the banks. The son of the landlord reappears after a stint in jail (because he ran over some guy!!) and he first befriends the new family, while we predict early on (from the very first scene) that his intentions are not as good as we are led to believe!!What follows is a series of events that had there been any prizes of predictability, it would surely take the biggest!The house itself fooled me into believing that some sort of 'The Others or The Shining' deep secret lurking in its sinister past without the supernatural element, but all I got was an average crime story, the likes of which occupied Angela Lansbury in Murder She Wrote.The actors had a tired look throughout the film, especially Dennis Quaid, however it was a delight watching the great Christopher Plummer even if his character was over the top.Stephen Dorff was very good as the psycho ex landlord 's son , while Juliette Lewis was completely wasted as his trashy girlfriend.This is all due to the fact that there was no direction, purpose or depth to any of these characters.I still believe that Mike Figgis is a talented director who can deliver a far better film than this.

This is the case of having a strong cast ( with the exception of Dennis Quaid ) in a terrible movie that could have been much better if the screenwriters and director had taken the time to go through the film more carefully. The entire movie seems rushed but after the first half you'll be glad it is.Sharon Stone and Dennis Quaid have no chemistry and were terribly unconvincing. Even their fright was too fake to take seriously and it only made Stephen Dorff's Dale laughable. Cold Creek Manor stole key moments from better films and tries hopelessly to become the "" Cape Fear "" of 2003 but it falls terribly short. Juliette Lewis was unneeded as the wasted tramp ( and she's played these roles millions of times before ). I think Juliette's a good actress if given decent material. Like Stephen Dorff they can only be as good as the movie and this film was awful. As a Dorff, Lewis and Stone fan I had to hit myself upside the head wondering what the heck they saw in this movie except for dollar signs.  Nothing could have been enough to star in this pitiful, wannabe thriller that sinks before it even swims.Save your money. The economy is too bad for Americans to waste even a dollar on trash like this. I had a feeling it was bad that's why I waited until Blockbuster had it previewed and I still think I was screwed. For people who bought this full price I feel sorry for you. This is one of those movies that shouldn't have left the director's head. It is terrible and instead of trying to copy "" Cape Fear "" and "" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "", Cold Creek Manor should have worked harder to become a movie that wasn't laughable before even trying to be scary. It fails as a thriller at every turn. But if you enjoy tired cliches, go for it. After all it's your money to waste if you feel the need.

789398,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0000YTOL2,Only-A-Child,"[1, 1]","There is so little to recommend about ""Cold Creek Manor"" that saying anything positive is a real reach. I guess that the production design is pretty good-it is a creepy old Canadian house. The movie has some entertainment value but only in the category of the unintentionally hilarious. It is hard to stop laughing during the snake scene as the family of four does a great imitation of the Three Stooges; whooping, screaming, and spinning around. Dennis Quaid is especially girly, the only way to make it funnier would have been if Quaid had been wearing one of his daughter's dresses. The clueless director fails to keep the four actors (playing family members) in character, as Kristen Stewart (the daughter) underplays and Quaid overplays-extremely. It looks like the daughter has switched personalities with her father. This is an extremely funny scene.""Cold Creek Manor"" is best described as a cross between ""Cecil B. Demented"" (Stephen Dorff reprises the title role)and ""Scary Movie 3"" minus all the intentional satire and humor. Because nothing ambitious is attempted, it does not even have the instructional value of most bad movies.Mike Figgis is arguably the most clueless director in history and ""Cold Creek Manor"" is a splendid fusion of all his directorial deficiencies. His physical casting is poor, he draws ""worst ever"" performances from almost everyone in the ensemble, and he ignores opportunities to lay misdirection and suspense.The rules of the psychological thriller genre are basic because they are so effective, they go back to the earliest days of the cinema. Even student films get a lot of mileage out of playing with these conventions because audiences already understand the language of this type of film. If you are not going to do a twist at the end (not having a twist is in and of itself a twist) you at least have to keep the audience off balance during the body of the film. ""Cold Creek Manor"" is predictable from its first frame to its last, it never deviates from the obvious. There are opportunities to play with the audience throughout the movie and Figgis drops the ball each time.Even little scenes can provide big thrills if correctly structured. Take the scene where Dorff's character kills his father. There are two possible ways for a competent director to play that scene. They could set it up so that the audience is lulled into thinking nothing will happen and is then stunned when the violence comes out of nowhere. Or it could be set up where everything (actions, score, motivation) telegraphs that a murder is about to happen, only to have it not occur. In this particular case Figgis built up the expectation that son was about to kill his father so that when he actually did so there was no surprise, no shock, no thrill.Near the end you conclude that the Stephen Dorff character is insanely stupid. You have reached the insanity diagnosis well before he actually declares his mental condition on the screen. You reach it because you have just seen him push Sharon Stone into a deep well and inexplicably permit her husband to fish her out. You have watched as the two of them hike out of the woods and through the fields to their house (Cold Creek Manor). You have watched as immediately upon their arrival Dorff breaks in and chases them onto the roof, where he announces that he intends to kill them and push them down the well (same well they just left way out in the woods; duh!).Then again, what do I know?

Watching the film I felt bad for the actors because there is no coherence in the movie. I thought that perhaps either the writers butchered the script through rewrites or that maybe there was a freshman editor that the director trusted so much that he let him rip his film to shreds, without his knowledge. However, the more probable case is that this movie was a mesh of nothing all along.Anyway, the film starts off interesting enough developing the relationship between Cooper (Dennis Quaid) and his family and displaying the reason they wish to leave New York. Things seem okay after the move into their new home in the country. Then the villian shows up and the film goes downhill. A sense of suspense tapers off once the bad guy is hired as a handy man and after the snakes show up, all suspense dies. Nothing makes sense from that point on and another movie is born, totally dissected from the first, except the same characters and actors are still around. What follows is a hodge-podge of nonsensical images and horror movie formulas that don't stay true to form. That's not even mentioning all the plot holes.Overall, the only reason worth seeing this movie is to see Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone. The only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because I really like Dennis Quaid. However, if you don't like either Dennis Quaid or Sharon Stone, ignore this movie altogether.",2,What?,1066521600,"10 19, 2003",2003,1820,"['previews', 'COLD', 'CREEK', 'MANOR', 'are', 'inticing', 'portray', 'film', 'being', 'spooky', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'possibly', 'sly', 'thriller', 'Unforunately', 'coming', 'attractions', 'are', 'better', 'actual', 'film.COLD', 'CREEK', 'MANOR', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'ghost', 'movie', 'sly', 'thriller', 'closest', 'being', 'thriller', 'not', 'thriller', 'either', 'simply', 'character', 'hodge-podge', 'devoid', 'meaning', 'Watching', 'film', 'felt', 'bad', 'actors', 'coherence', 'movie', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'writers', 'butchered', 'script', 'rewrites', 'maybe', 'was', 'freshman', 'editor', 'director', 'trusted', 'so', 'much', 'let', 'rip', 'film', 'shreds', 'knowledge', 'However', 'more', 'probable', 'case', 'movie', 'was', 'mesh', 'nothing', 'along.Anyway', 'film', 'interesting', 'enough', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Cooper', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'family', 'displaying', 'reason', 'wish', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'Things', 'seem', 'okay', 'move', 'new', 'home', 'country', 'Then', 'villian', 'up', 'film', 'downhill', 'sense', 'suspense', 'tapers', 'off', 'once', 'bad', 'guy', 'hired', 'handy', 'man', 'snakes', 'show', 'up', 'suspense', 'Nothing', 'sense', 'point', 'movie', 'born', 'totally', 'dissected', 'first', 'same', 'characters', 'actors', 'are', 'still', 'around', 'What', 'hodge-podge', 'nonsensical', 'images', 'horror', 'movie', 'formulas', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'true', 'form', 'not', 'even', 'mentioning', 'plot', 'holes.Overall', 'only', 'reason', 'seeing', 'movie', 'see', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'instead', '1', 'really', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'ignore', 'movie', 'altogether']",N/A

Not to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it--the stunt with the rope that does in the villain--is pathetically unrealistic--and no villain would ever put up such feeble resistance in an attempt to escape such a &quot;trap&quot;--especially one as crazed as Dorff is made out to be.I don't really recommend this movie--but if you're bored with nothing better to do--it's an ok way to squander away a couple of hours.Another thing I found tedious about this movie was the role reversals-the husband basically acting like the stereotypical wife in these alleged &quot;thrillers&quot;-and the wife being portrayed in a manner like the typical male lead--with a testosterone heavy female Sherriff as well.

In fact the whole cast in here looks to be collecting a check from the suckers who rent, or god-forbid, bought, this horribly cliche-ridden trash. This film was not scary, not suspenseful, full ofmore holes than a block of Swiss cheese, and a waste of most of the 'talent' gathered for it. Basically, a tragic event drives an affluent New York family to seek shelter in the quieter countryside, where they just happen to discover an abandoned mansion that they choose to purchase. It's not long before it's former tenant(Stephen Dorff) shows up on their doorstep unannounced, and does his best redneck creep impression. The cliches in here are laughable, the characters are weak and extremely stupid for such urban sophisticates.

Cold Creek Manor is one of those films (well, that's what happened in Australia).

It also has some try hard scary scenes (ie. the snake scene), but I imagine a madman could do that sort of thing if provoked.Unfortunately, the movie proves that Sharon Stone is a rather ordinary actor, and while Dennis Quaid acts the same in all his roles, he is quite convincing as a man in danger.Cold Creek Manor is worthy of one viewing ... even if Stephen Dorff is annoying as the madman.",3,Cold creek manor,1093132800,"08 22, 2004",2004,713,"['am', 'always', 'careful', 'films', 'skip', 'cinemas', 'go', 'straight', 'DVD', 'Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'one', 'films', 'well', 'what', 'happened', 'Australia', 'However', 'reading', 'back', 'cover', 'decided', 'sounded', 'ok', 'particularly', 'being', 'thriller.While', 'far', 'being', 'original', 'creepy', 'moments', 'also', 'try', 'hard', 'scary', 'scenes', 'ie', 'snake', 'scene', 'imagine', 'madman', 'could', 'do', 'sort', 'thing', 'provoked.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'actor', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'same', 'roles', 'quite', 'convincing', 'man', 'danger.Cold', 'Creek', 'Manor', 'worthy', 'one', 'viewing', 'even', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'annoying', 'madman']",N/A

But then a new scene would come and it would quickly turn into utter silliness.There are scenes in the movies that left me shaking my head, saying, ""I can't believe how stupid that was,"" or, ""I can't believe they put that in the movie.""For those that haven't watched the movie, all I can say is that it is poorly made. The acting was ok. Stephen Dorff shined as Dale Massey, and Juliette Lewis was decent as Ruby. Sharon Stone was even passable as Leah Tilson, with what few lines she had. Dennis Quaid was the real stinker in the movie, and I don't believe much of his acting troubles were his own burden. The script was simply foolish at times.There is a scene in the movie where the actors are running around, and snakes are everywhere. The desired effect was supposed to be terror, but when you watch it you want to laugh because it is so ridiculously pieced together on film.A second bad scene is when Quaid is coming home from a bar. He is being chased, and hits a deer. The next morning his family, for no reason, turns on him and believes he has hit the family horse. (The horse, by the way, is called a pony in the movie...how laughable! It isn't a pony at all, but rather a full grown horse.)Scenes like this abound in Cold Creek Manor. People react with no motivation, and the story sags. Even the music is horrible. The music in the snake scene makes it seems more like a circus act than a suspenseful moment.Enough said on this stinker.
