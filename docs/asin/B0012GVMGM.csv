It was not disappointing and had everything I wanted for my baby. She is 15 months old and doesn't yet like the slower poems, like William Shakespeare, but when she is a little older, I think she will get into the groove. So, if you like the first three, you will like this one as well. It has poems, songs, and children reading poems or talking about poems. It even has a poem in Spanish, which is very beautifully read by Andy Garcia.",4,Good addition to classical baby series,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,515,"['had', 'first', 'three', 'classical', 'baby', 'DVDs', 'wanted', 'get', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'not', 'disappointing', 'had', 'everything', 'wanted', 'baby', '15', 'months', 'old', ""n't"", 'yet', 'slower', 'poems', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'when', 'little', 'older', 'think', 'will', 'get', 'groove', 'So', 'like', 'first', 'three', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'poems', 'songs', 'children', 'reading', 'poems', 'talking', 'poems', 'even', 'poem', 'Spanish', 'very', 'beautifully', 'read', 'Andy', 'Garcia']",Classical Baby:I'm Grown Up Now:The Poetry Show

I never get tired of them.This video is for kids a little older, as it deals with poetry and words.We also have Goodnight Moon, bedtime stories with footage of kids in between talking about their concept of sleep and dreams. It's very persuasive.PLEASE HBO MAKE MORE OF THESE PROGRAMS!!
