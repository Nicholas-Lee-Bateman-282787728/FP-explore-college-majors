1370839,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,B003XMKN7M,Baberufus,"[4, 4]","Rory Gallagher was one of the most underrated guitarists/songwriters of the classic rock era, if not THE most. Like Clapton, he came into his own around the time that blues and rock were coming together to produce the kind of music at the forefront of the late 1960's. While hugely popular in Europe, he never took off in the United States, and sadly he still hasn't got his due. The documentary part of this 2-DVD set explains how his lack of Top 40 presence was largely due to his integrity to his own music and not bending to popular trends or watered-down versions of his songs in order to crack the mainstream. That, along with the fact that he wasn't a ""shredder"", kept his awareness in the mainstream from equaling that of Clapton, Ted Nugent, etc. However, looking back now in this world of crap music reigning the charts, such integrity makes him a hero to true and pure music, underlining the now-obsolete concept that talent is more important than the almighty three-minute single with cliche lyrics and unoriginal melodies. More people should follow Rory Gallagher's example and more important, listen to his music! The man was a remarkable guitarist, singer and songwriter. Well, not the greatest singer, but good enough, and he did have a unique and identifiable style. As did Jimi Hendrix, Rory possessed talents in other areas that more than made up for any shortcomings as a vocalist.The performance DVD is fantastic, showing the power of Rory's 3-piece group in the blues-rock tradition set by Cream and Hendrix. He also performs some excellent acoustic numbers to change it up. This is the only video footage that I know of that features Wilgar Campbell, his first drummer, who turns in a fantastic performance, along with his trusty right-hand man Gerry McAvoy on bass.

1370842,A39YLMCOWLTU7I,B003XMKN7M,Me Again,"[3, 4]","The documentary is well done, and I suppose it's pretty informative for those who aren't that familiar with Rory.  I've been a fan for a long time, and have read Gerry McAvoy's book, so I didn't learn much that I didn't already know.There's a scene on stage in the doc from one of Rory's last gigs.  His body is bloated from the steroids, his face is contorted, and he's obviously in pain.  Very hard to watch.  I prefer to remember him as he was in the early days, so well represented on the second disc of the Beat Club performances.  So alive, vibrant and filled with energy, his talent just flowing from his fingers through his guitar and out of his amplifier.  As others have already noted here, these performances are astounding, proving yet again that Rory Gallagher was arguably the best guitarist of his time.  He didn't have to take a back seat to Hendrix, Clapton or Page.  In my opinion, only Jeff Beck was his equal in the ""classic rock"" era.This DVD is exceptionally well produced, sound and picture quality are excellent.  I only hope Donal Gallagher is working on releasing the all-acoustic performance from Irish TV in 1977, and the Old Grey Whistle Test gig from Rory's 28th birthday in 1976.",5,Simply Amazing,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,1210,"['documentary', 'well', 'done', 'suppose', 'pretty', 'informative', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Rory', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'read', 'Gerry', 'McAvoy', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know.There', 'scene', 'stage', 'doc', 'one', 'Rory', 'last', 'gigs', 'body', 'bloated', 'steroids', 'face', 'contorted', 'obviously', 'pain', 'Very', 'hard', 'watch', 'prefer', 'remember', 'was', 'early', 'days', 'so', 'well', 'represented', 'second', 'disc', 'Beat', 'Club', 'performances', 'So', 'alive', 'vibrant', 'filled', 'energy', 'talent', 'just', 'flowing', 'fingers', 'guitar', 'amplifier', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'noted', 'here', 'performances', 'are', 'astounding', 'proving', 'yet', 'again', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'was', 'arguably', 'best', 'guitarist', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'Hendrix', 'Clapton', 'Page', 'opinion', 'only', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'was', 'equal', 'classic', 'rock', 'era.This', 'DVD', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'produced', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'only', 'hope', 'Donal', 'Gallagher', 'working', 'releasing', 'all-acoustic', 'performance', 'Irish', 'TV', '1977', 'Old', 'Grey', 'Whistle', 'Test', 'gig', 'Rory', '28th', 'birthday', '1976']",Ghost Blues: The Story of Rory Gallagher & the Beat Club Sessions

This fantastic 2 disc dvd set covers the life of Rory Gallagher from his childhood in Ireland to his untimely death in England at the young age of 47. Born William Rory Gallagher on March 2, 1948, Rory was the first child of Daniel and Monica Gallagher, who both were musically talented with not only singing, but Daniel also played accordian. At around age 5 or 6, Rory loved to sing and play his songs on a little dimestore plastic ukelele. It wasn't long before Rory's parents bought him his first real wood guitar at the young age of 9. Rory quickly showed his natural talent and began winning talent contests, using the prize money to buy yet a better guitar. In 1961 Rory's parents bought him the very first Fender Stratocaster guitar in Ireland- a Sunburst model which cost 100 pounds. Rory's younger brother Donal tells many great stories about Rory on this dvd and about how this guitar might as well have cost 100 million pounds, as his parents went into great debt to afford this gift for Rory. Rory used this very famous guitar through every decade up until his death in 1995.There are many very rare pictures, films and stories on this tremendous dvd about Rory. He was the first great Blues guitarist in Ireland who opened the doors for all the other great Irish bands such as Thin Lizzy,  U2 and many others. There are also many great photos, stories and films from Rory's first band from the sixties, The Taste. Besides many great commentaries and stories from his brother Donal, we also hear from Bob Geldof, Bill Wyman, Cameron Crowe, his bandmates, many others and Rory himself on this dvd. The stories from his brother Donal are wonderful, as we hear how there were no blues bands in Ireland, so Rory had to learn everything from listening to Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly and other blues greats on the radio and tv. Rory's genius didn't stop with just the guitar, he also played slide guitar, alto saxophone, bass, mandolin, banjo, harmonica and coral sitar. He was well known playing at the Marquee Club in the U.K. sharing the stage with other greats such as Cream.On the second dvd are rare, never before seen performances from The Beat Club Sessions in 1971 and 1972. These early, rare performances have been  cleaned up so the picture looks absolutely fantastic with crisp colors and superb sound! The cameras showcase Rory's early guitar work and is a real treat to see up close! A very young Rory is joined by Gerry McAvoy on bass guitar and Wilgar Campbell on drums playing the following songs:1.  Laundromat2.  Hands Up3.  Sinnerboy4.  Just The Smile5.  Used To Be6.  In Your Town7.  Should've Learned My Lesson8.  Crest Of A Wave9.  Toredown10. Pistol Slapper Blues11. I Don't Know Where I'm Going12. Going To My Hometown13. I Could've Had Religion14. McAvoy Boogie15. Hoodoo Man16. Messin' With The KidIn the late 80's, Rory began to have health problems and in 1995 he had a successful liver transplant. Just before being released from the hospital, Rory developed a MRSA infection. His health quickly deteriorated and he died on June 14, 1995. Ireland lost their leader of the Irish rock movement and the world lost a great blues guitarist, singer, songwriter and bandleader. This dvd set is a fitting tribute to Rory Gallagher whose life was too short, but whose tremendous talent will live on forever through his great trailblazing blues music!",5,FANTASTIC TRIBUTE WITH RARE NEVER BEFORE SEEN FOOTAGE!,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,3517,"['Ghost', 'Blues', 'Story', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'must', 'have', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'fan', 'anyone', 'who', 'simply', 'great', 'Blues', 'fantastic', '2', 'disc', 'dvd', 'set', 'life', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'childhood', 'Ireland', 'untimely', 'death', 'England', 'young', 'age', '47', 'Born', 'William', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'March', '2', '1948', 'Rory', 'was', 'first', 'child', 'Daniel', 'Monica', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'were', 'musically', 'talented', 'not', 'only', 'singing', 'Daniel', 'also', 'played', 'accordian', 'age', '5', '6', 'Rory', 'loved', 'sing', 'play', 'songs', 'little', 'dimestore', 'plastic', 'ukelele', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Rory', 'parents', 'bought', 'first', 'real', 'wood', 'guitar', 'young', 'age', '9', 'Rory', 'quickly', 'showed', 'natural', 'talent', 'began', 'winning', 'talent', 'contests', 'using', 'prize', 'money', 'buy', 'yet', 'better', 'guitar', '1961', 'Rory', 'parents', 'bought', 'very', 'first', 'Fender', 'Stratocaster', 'guitar', 'Ireland-', 'Sunburst', 'model', 'cost', '100', 'pounds', 'Rory', 'younger', 'brother', 'Donal', 'many', 'great', 'stories', 'Rory', 'dvd', 'how', 'guitar', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'cost', '100', 'million', 'pounds', 'parents', 'went', 'great', 'debt', 'afford', 'gift', 'Rory', 'Rory', 'used', 'very', 'famous', 'guitar', 'decade', 'up', 'death', '1995.There', 'are', 'many', 'very', 'rare', 'pictures', 'films', 'stories', 'tremendous', 'dvd', 'Rory', 'was', 'first', 'great', 'Blues', 'guitarist', 'Ireland', 'who', 'opened', 'doors', 'other', 'great', 'Irish', 'bands', 'such', 'Thin', 'Lizzy', 'U2', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'great', 'photos', 'stories', 'films', 'Rory', 'first', 'band', 'sixties', 'Taste', 'Besides', 'many', 'great', 'commentaries', 'stories', 'brother', 'Donal', 'also', 'hear', 'Bob', 'Geldof', 'Bill', 'Wyman', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'bandmates', 'many', 'others', 'Rory', 'dvd', 'stories', 'brother', 'Donal', 'are', 'wonderful', 'hear', 'how', 'were', 'blues', 'Ireland', 'so', 'Rory', 'had', 'learn', 'everything', 'listening', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Lead', 'Belly', 'other', 'blues', 'greats', 'radio', 'tv', 'Rory', 'genius', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'just', 'guitar', 'also', 'played', 'slide', 'guitar', 'alto', 'saxophone', 'bass', 'mandolin', 'banjo', 'harmonica', 'coral', 'sitar', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'playing', 'Marquee', 'Club', 'U.K.', 'sharing', 'stage', 'other', 'greats', 'such', 'Cream.On', 'second', 'dvd', 'are', 'rare', 'never', 'seen', 'performances', 'Beat', 'Club', 'Sessions', '1971', '1972', 'early', 'rare', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'so', 'picture', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'crisp', 'colors', 'superb', 'sound', 'cameras', 'showcase', 'Rory', 'early', 'guitar', 'work', 'real', 'treat', 'see', 'up', 'close', 'very', 'young', 'Rory', 'joined', 'Gerry', 'McAvoy', 'bass', 'guitar', 'Wilgar', 'Campbell', 'drums', 'playing', 'following', 'songs:1', 'Laundromat2', 'Hands', 'Up3', 'Sinnerboy4', 'Just', 'Smile5', 'Used', 'Be6', 'Town7', 'Should', ""'ve"", 'Learned', 'My', 'Lesson8', 'Crest', 'A', 'Wave9', 'Toredown10', 'Pistol', 'Slapper', 'Blues11', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Where', ""'m"", 'Going12', 'Going', 'My', 'Hometown13', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'Had', 'Religion14', 'McAvoy', 'Boogie15', 'Hoodoo', 'Man16', 'Messin', 'KidIn', 'late', '80', 'Rory', 'began', 'have', 'health', 'problems', '1995', 'had', 'successful', 'liver', 'transplant', 'Just', 'being', 'released', 'hospital', 'Rory', 'developed', 'MRSA', 'infection', 'health', 'quickly', 'deteriorated', 'died', 'June', '14', '1995', 'Ireland', 'lost', 'leader', 'Irish', 'rock', 'movement', 'world', 'lost', 'great', 'blues', 'guitarist', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'bandleader', 'dvd', 'set', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'life', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'tremendous', 'talent', 'will', 'live', 'forever', 'great', 'trailblazing', 'blues', 'music']",Ghost Blues: The Story of Rory Gallagher & the Beat Club Sessions
