From start to finish the writers/producers seem to have taken the general plot outline and characters and dropped most of the actual story.It will do all right as a way to spend an afternoon if you haven't read the book (at this writing the paperback is $2 cheaper)but too much is so unlike what Ms. Auel wrote. I know that lot's of detail had to be removed for times sake but at what cost to the story? Little Ayla's orphaning resembles the book as does her discovery by the Clan but the way the Neanderthals behave isn't like the book. I don't even remember all of the scenes but when Ayla gives birth to her son Durc, that's conpletely different, although good. Later in the story when Ayla's adoptive mother Iza (Pamela Reed unrocognizable in makeup)is too old and frail to go to the CLan Gathering Ayla is sent in her place, they made a real mess of that one.Daryl Hannah is very well cast as the adult Ayla, she's the best reason to watch ths movie.",3,"Save your money, buy the book",1068940800,"11 16, 2003",2003,1034,"['so', 'often', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'books', 'one', 'real', 'loser', 'start', 'finish', 'writers/producers', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'general', 'plot', 'outline', 'characters', 'dropped', 'most', 'actual', 'story.It', 'will', 'do', 'right', 'way', 'spend', 'afternoon', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'writing', 'paperback', '2', 'cheaper', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'what', 'Ms.', 'Auel', 'wrote', 'know', 'lot', 'detail', 'had', 'be', 'removed', 'times', 'sake', 'what', 'cost', 'story', 'Little', 'Ayla', 'orphaning', 'book', 'discovery', 'Clan', 'way', 'Neanderthals', 'behave', ""n't"", 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'scenes', 'when', 'Ayla', 'birth', 'son', 'Durc', 'conpletely', 'different', 'good', 'Later', 'story', 'when', 'Ayla', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'Iza', 'Pamela', 'Reed', 'unrocognizable', 'makeup', 'too', 'old', 'frail', 'go', 'CLan', 'Gathering', 'Ayla', 'sent', 'place', 'made', 'real', 'mess', 'one.Daryl', 'Hannah', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'adult', 'Ayla', 'best', 'reason', 'watch', 'ths', 'movie']",N/A

I liked the book very much, which is what prompted me to buy the movie. In agreement with another reviewer, if you are going to watch it to nit-pick  about plot inconsistencies, the film is not for you. But all of the book's  characterization and polemical elements are there in flying colors in the  movie.What was most startling for me was the performance given by Daryl  Hannah. I am not a frequent movie viewer, so her name immediately brought  to mind &quot;Splash&quot; - which this definitely is NOT. Her portrayal of  Ayla was one of the finest acting performances I have seen... especially  given (or because of) the language / sign language handicap. Auel spent a  lot of time in the book describing the modes of non-verbal communication of  the Clan, and it is clear that Hannah was up to the challenge of  communicating the character of Ayla through action, gesture, expression,  and posture. Her subtly was amazing and is appreciated more upon a second  or third viewing.The movie's feel is a little minimalist because of the  lack of dialog, especially as compared with the lush descriptive passages  of the book. However, the scenery and acting in this big-screen version  more than compensate for the lack of the book's strong narrative.I  would also mention that the &quot;over eighteen&quot; rating of this movie  seemed a little inappropriate to me. For those familiar with the book, the  rape scene is done in the spirit of supporting the story and  characterization - emotionally / spiritually anguishing but not overtly  violent or sexual.",5,One of the finest adaptations of a book to film,964137600,"07 21, 2000",2000,1635,"['film', 'essence', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'Jean', 'Auel', 'liked', 'book', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'prompted', 'buy', 'movie', 'agreement', 'reviewer', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'nit-pick', 'plot', 'inconsistencies', 'film', 'not', 'book', 'characterization', 'polemical', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'flying', 'colors', 'movie.What', 'was', 'most', 'startling', 'was', 'performance', 'given', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'am', 'not', 'frequent', 'movie', 'viewer', 'name', 'immediately', 'brought', 'mind', 'quot', 'Splash', 'quot', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'portrayal', 'Ayla', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'acting', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'especially', 'given', 'language', '/', 'sign', 'language', 'handicap', 'Auel', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'book', 'describing', 'modes', 'non-verbal', 'communication', 'Clan', 'clear', 'Hannah', 'was', 'up', 'challenge', 'communicating', 'character', 'Ayla', 'action', 'gesture', 'expression', 'posture', 'subtly', 'was', 'amazing', 'appreciated', 'more', 'second', 'third', 'viewing.The', 'movie', 'feel', 'little', 'minimalist', 'lack', 'dialog', 'especially', 'compared', 'lush', 'descriptive', 'passages', 'book', 'However', 'scenery', 'acting', 'big-screen', 'version', 'more', 'compensate', 'lack', 'book', 'strong', 'narrative.I', 'would', 'also', 'mention', 'quot', 'eighteen', 'quot', 'rating', 'movie', 'seemed', 'little', 'inappropriate', 'familiar', 'book', 'rape', 'scene', 'done', 'spirit', 'supporting', 'story', 'characterization', 'emotionally', '/', 'spiritually', 'anguishing', 'not', 'overtly', 'violent', 'sexual']",N/A

I'll have to put them on my list because I did like this film.Having said that I will say that it's a bit far fetched. Ayla, played by Daryl Hannah, is an uber feminist Cro-Magnon woman. Sure, that's a big boost for womankind, but totally unrealistic when it comes down to it. Having been raised by a group of male first Neanderthals chances of her being such a feminist in this hard time is really not that high.But then there wouldn't have been a story. The ""sets"" were very nice and I felt put you into the mode of caveman. Their world would have been harsh, but still beautiful because of the lack of machines and high rises.

109593,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,0790741989,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[1, 1]","Reading the latest Jean M. Auel's Earth's Children's offering ""The Land of Painted Caves: A Novel (Earth's Children),"" has spurred on a nostalgic journey back into her nearly thirty-year-old classic Cave Bear territory.  Most definitely, a re-look at the film directed by Michael Chapman and starring Daryl Hannah as Cro-Magnon Ayla rounds out the cave experience by adding some visual references that would further delineate the differences and similarities between the orphaned girl and her foster family of Neanderthals.  Unfortunately, the film does little to enhance the anthropological story of Neanderthal decline and Cro-Magnun supremacy or underline the human drama so poignantly illustrated in the novel of the same name.  If anything, cladding the stunningly statuesque Hannah in attractively draped furs and suede thongs as a Raquel Welsh (One Million Years B.C.) pin-up for the 80s might suppress any forward-thinking advancements for mankind in general by setting off `the Neanderthal' in most of the film's male viewers.Nevertheless, it's all in fun.  As the inimitable Ayla, Hannah wows the audience with her blonde beauty.  The fact that she can accurately throw a bolo (the novel's Ayla uses a sling), comprehend the Mo-Gur's magical counting concept with ease and fearlessly and compassionately heal anything from a fever to a wolf bite while folding her sinewy body to resemble the more stocky physique of her bow-legged tribesmen smacks of a veritable Wonder Woman legend in the making.""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" is just that: a legend in the making.  Narrated with great solemnity by Salome Jens, Ayla's story becomes universal while Ayla's wit, prowess and ingenuity matches that of any of the great heroes that enthralled men and women throughout the ages from the time of sitting around a campfire to parking on a comfortable couch, Kindle in hand.However, while the intention of the director might be to present Ayla as an evolutionary heroine the likes of which rival Hercules or Odysseus, his attempts are so abbreviated that the underlying message heralding the supremacy of the Cro-Magnon brain in the battle for survival of the fittest becomes obscure amidst the more two-dimensional struggle between Ayla and the bullying leader-to-be, Broud.  As moving as motives of anger, jealousy, and revenge can be, more scenes with the thoughtful Creb (played by James Remar -Dexter's father-in a full regalia of makeup that make him virtually unidentifiable) as the tribe shaman with his sad realizations of the eventual demise of the Clan along with more of Ayla's inner dialogue as she puzzles out new innovations that are not part of the Neanderthal memories would intensify the film's anthropological theme on a level richer in historical implication.  Keeping within the bounds of a rigid storytelling, the narration prevents us from hearing individual voices that enrich the story's impact and emotional depth.As the film came out in a more eco-conscious 1986, the set design focuses on the primordial beauty of the natural world with lush scenes of green forests, wondrous mountain vistas and other pristine examples of the earth before its children ravaged it through innovation and industry. The actual hardships that one would associate with life with little more than a cave for shelter and a well-earned fur wrap snatched from the back of the animal that grew it for protection against the elements seem a trivialized backdrop for the main theme of something new and more advanced entering a group dynamic where things have been done in the same way for centuries. Other than to present the ""Clan"" as a grunting bunch of mop tops from a Hair Metal band with extra-pronounced eyebrows, the Neanderthals depicted are just dirtier Cro-Magnons rather than the stronger, squattier and pelt-ier ""flathead"" animals described by novelist Auel in later books of her series.  Ayla may be smarter--able to use her voice to speak, analyze, deduce and execute something never done before--but the sign-language using Clan members definitely possess greater apelike strength--so much so that one man could carry his share of a kill on his back.  In this light, the climatic scene between Ayla and Broud seems far-fetched--brute force would definitely win out over the elegance of more refined thinking.Bottom line?  As a novel, Jean Auel's ""The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, Book One)"" provides a rich experience for a reader fascinated by the challenge of early man to eke out a comfortable existence for himself in a prehistoric world requiring mental and physical prowess while adhering to inherent societal rules that integrate the community as a functioning organism.  In addition, the interplay of human emotion shared by lesser advanced Neanderthals and Darwinian-survival-ready Cro-Magnons emphasizes that man is man no matter how he evolves or what technology he develops.  His basic needs remain the same.  Although it tries, the film version presents the novel's themes but not its nuance.  The use of a narrator makes Ayla's story seem the stuff of legend, but the plodding pace of the film forces the motivation for her remarkable achievements into a narrower realm of rebellion against Clan male chauvinism rather than the dawning of a new age for quintessential man.  Nevertheless, the film is fun and recommended for Ayla diehards.  Keep in mind that most of the film is subtitled as the Clan speaks in grunts and signs.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Con Cave,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,5503,"['Reading', 'latest',

Yet her innocent boyish-girlishness makes her the perfect breaker of taboos as she successfully becomes the ""Woman Who Hunts"".

And Nicole Eggert is endearing as the teenage Ayla.  I will never forget when, at a dull moment by the fire, Creb teaches her how to count to 5 (the rest of the clan can only get to 3).  Ayla instantly learns her lesson then becomes HIS teacher and shows him a way to count to 20!  ""Don't talk about this to the clan,"" he warns.Ferny redwood forests, snowy mountains, and the majestic music of Alan Silvestri surround this fine ensemble of actors who seem so natural speaking in signs and thinking with their eyes.

Ala being of a different race was thought to be a bad omen so she was descriminated by most of the tribe. The leader's son hates her the most and tries his hardest to make her life miserible. He rapes her repetedly (they are fully clothed) so it's not supprising that she eventually became pregnant. In this tribe it is punishable by death for a woman to touch a weapon but she teaches herself how to use a sling. When the tribe is out in the forest a pack of wolves almost killed a clan toddler but Ala saved the baby by killing the wolf with the sling. Because she saved a clan member her life was spared but she was cast from the tribe for a month. During that month she gave birth to a boy she named Derk and was the only one to have ever servive and come back to the tribe. She earned most of the tribes respect after that and was permited to hunt for her son since she had no mate, but that made the leader's son even more angery. When he became leader the first thing he said was that he would take Ala as his mate and ordered Ala to give Derk to another clan member to be brought up by them. Ala's adopted father, Crom, was ordered to be cast out where being an old cripple would die. Because Ala loved Crom (who always stood up for Ala) she stood up against the new leader and was cast out again. The new leader hit Crom to make him leave too so Ala began to fight him for Crom's sake and won. The old leader took the necklace (that showed him to be leader) back and said that Ala was much more than he would ever be and wished Ala was his child. Ala being banished from the Cave Bear clan left seeking her people leaving her son who would eventally become clan leader.Although I don't think the movie is historically correct, it was a good movie. There is a nerrative, the rest of the movie is in subtitles.

Daryl Hannah portrayed Ayla, the young Cro-Magnon woman raised by Neanderthals brilliantly.  Considering the film was acted out with no speech and only sign language that was subtitled on the screen Hannah managed to capture the essence of a vulnerable young woman so different from the people she was living among.  The entire cast were amazing, from James Remar who played the crippled holy man Creb, and Pamela Reed who became Ayla's adopted mother Iza.  The plot centers around Ayla and how she struggles to fit in with her adopted kin.  However Ayla is a new breed of human and her desire to learn beyond her lowly status of a Clan woman brings her into conflict with those she loves.  Ayla finally realizes she cannot stay with the Clan because she is so different, she has to find her own people but she leaves behind a gift, her son, Durc, a child of mixed spirits, both Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal who will ensure the survival of those she leaves behind.  The music score is haunting and evocative, and the scenery is breathtaking.  One of the highlights of the film is the gathering of all the Clans, and the ritual slaying of the Cave Bear.  It is here that Ayla realizes how different she really is.  This is an intelligent film that is seriously under-rated.

Then, a week ago I began reading the book after my mom found it in a thrift store. I absolutely loved it! It has to be my all time favorite book ever, and I get bored easily with some books, especially ones that have to do with the cave man era. (I will admit that the first 20-30 pages of the book I was wondering what was going on with the clan, but I hung in there and it was WELL worth it!)I bought the DVD yesterday, extremely excited to see the movie.Boy, I got lost in some of the parts and I had just finished the book! I really thought the Harry Potter book to movie adaptions were bad and then I saw this. Bleck! I realize a lot of details needed to be left out (it is, after all a 500 page book) but some of the most important ones that showed the emotions and less evolved thinking of the clan that was very important shouldn't have been! One thing I noticed was that the movie spared no time in the 'rape' scenes of Daryl Hannah. C'mon, don't you think there were more important things you could have concentrated on? It wasn't even 10% of the book, but it made up for 30% of the movie. And important parts of the movie such as Ayla's first period, or even the birth of her child were all together forgotten or molested. I didn't like the movie at all- I wish they would do a mini-series or ""The Stand"" type movie where its 6 hours long. Who cares? Enough people love the book that they would buy it and find the time to watch it, I know I would. After watching this movie, I definatly think it is worth a do-over. And, for people who loved the movie, I'm glad for you. I just don't think it did the book justice. My boyfriend even said that if the book was anything like the movie he wasn't reading it all..How many other people had that same opinion after seeing this wretched 'masterpiece'.",2,I should have rented it,1056672000,"06 27, 2003",2003,1895,"['had', 'seen', 'movie', 'stores', 'passed', 'even', 'really', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'Then', 'week', 'ago', 'began', 'reading', 'book', 'mom', 'found', 'thrift', 'store', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'be', 'time', 'favorite', 'book', 'ever', 'get', 'bored', 'easily', 'books', 'especially', 'ones', 'have', 'do', 'cave', 'man', 'era', 'will', 'admit', 'first', '20-30', 'pages', 'book', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'clan', 'hung', 'was', 'WELL', 'worth', 'bought', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'extremely', 'excited', 'see', 'movie.Boy', 'got', 'lost', 'parts', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'book', 'really', 'thought', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptions', 'were', 'bad', 'then', 'saw', 'Bleck', 'realize', 'lot', 'details', 'needed', 'be', 'left', 'out', '500', 'page', 'book', 'most', 'important', 'ones', 'showed', 'emotions', 'less', 'evolved', 'thinking', 'clan', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'movie', 'spared', 'time', ""'rape"", 'scenes', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', ""C'mon"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'concentrated', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', '10', '%', 'book', 'made', 'up', '30', '%', 'movie', 'important', 'parts', 'movie', 'such', 'Ayla', 'first', 'period', 'even', 'birth', 'child', 'were', 'together', 'forgotten', 'molested', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'all-', 'wish', 'would', 'do', 'mini-series', 'Stand', 'type', 'movie', 'where', '6', 'hours', 'long', 'Who', 'Enough', 'people', 'love', 'book', 'would', 'buy', 'find', 'time', 'watch', 'know', 'would', 'watching', 'movie', 'definatly', 'think', 'do-over', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'book', 'justice', 'boyfriend', 'even', 'said', 'book', 'was', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'reading', 'all..How', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'had', 'same', 'opinion', 'seeing', 'wretched', ""'masterpiece""]",N/A

In many respects, I thought this translation was successful, but I felt that much of it was not.As can be expected with all book-to-film projects, many of the finer details and even plot points have been left out in order to make a film that people can watch in one sitting. This film does a decent job of jamming an heavy volume into a normal length screen film.The film has to tackle the difficulty of conveying a story of people who only speak with signs, not with voices resulting in subtitles that tell the story throughout the movie. Although this is a literal adaptation, it is simply impossible to convey characters' state of mind through body language alone (which is easily done through the third person POV in the book). The result is a story on film that has become so simplified that there is no depth left. We cannot successfully ""see"" the culture, the differences of the society that Ayla becomes part of but remains an outcast. More creativity in the screen writing could have led to a more successful film.The film did much to represent an accurate setting - the cave man era, I thought, was well done. There was also a clear difference between Ayla herself and the rest of the people, and I must hail Daryl Hannah for a supreme effort to play an awkward, gangly child/young woman who is considered head strong and strange among the Clan.In general, the acting, such as it was (largely restricted to grunts and hand waving) was a true challenge for the actors and all-in-all pretty good. Some of the more emotional scenes are gruelling to watch, as they were gruelling to read in the book. The characters were more black and white than in the book, but this is also to be expected in adaptations since nuance is easily lost. The characters are easily identifiable and the audience can keep track of them.All in all, I was disappointed with the effort. It is not an easy story to translate to film. I knew this before I watched the movie. Nevertheless, this film will remain to me one of those that will never live up to the book which is undoubtedly deserves a 5-star rating.

109625,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,0790741989,Richard J. Brzostek,"[4, 4]","""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" brings us into the prehistory world based on Jean M. Auel's novel with the same name.  It is a story of a Cro-Magnon girl named Ayla who is raised by a Neanderthal tribe.  We see a full look at her young life from how she became separated from her mother and found by the Neanderthals to her growing up to become a spirited young woman (Daryl Hannah).She stands out from the tribe in many ways.  From her looks, with blond hair, she truly is different than all the others with brown or dark hair.  Her actions also make her different.  She doesn't follow all of the clan's rules, such as the one about women being forbidden to touch a weapon.  She really is, in a way, an early feminist and rebel.  As the society is male dominated and all the women are subservient to the men, she does run into some troubles due to her nature.  Even with her differences, she does find a place with them, but always remaining partially an outsider.As the Neanderthals use a combination of sign language and spoken word, I found it clever how the film was in subtitles, which added a sense of realism.  I personally do not take the film to be a documentary, so I do not get caught up in any of the details that might make an anthropologist go into a tizzy.

I found the movie to be a decent little story of a young woman, who refuses to conform to the stringently patriarchal structure of her community. Ayla is a Cro-Magnon girl, who is adopted into a clan of the more populous Neanderthals after her mother dies and she is orphaned. Being an outsider and `ugly' by Neanderthal standards, she is accepted by only some of this newfound family. She is taught the role of `subservient female' by the elder women of the clan, which entails preparing meals for the men-folk, groveling before them as they serve them and prostrating themselves for sex on demand. Eventually these copulations take their toll as Ayla conceives a child, which forces her to make some excruciating decisions. By this time, she has a few very good friends in the family because she has learned self defense and considers herself every bit the equal of the men. This Cro-Magnon feminism is quite understandable, due to the fact some of the men have lived up to our modern concepts of `Neanderthal.' Since I don't want to reveal too much, you'll need to watch the movie to see what becomes of Ayla. It is nice to see a young Nicole Eggert as the teenage Ayla, and Darryl Hannah turns in a solid performance as the adult Ayla. It is fascinating to watch the portrayal of life during this period, especially the communications. Whether or not this is accurate is impossible to determine, though apparently great effort was made to make it as close to what research at the time indicated. The way of life is almost incidental in this movie, however, because the story itself transcends time.

I had read the original  novel and I wanted to see this film. When I opened the DVD box they had that rare Scene Selection brochure with multiple chapters, each one  listed I was familiar with from the original book. I had expected a total destruction of the novel based on  rumors and crap. Darryl Hannah, plays Ayla, and she does a marvelous job, the central character in the book and  the movie. Her family has been killed in an earthquake and  she has to fend for herself. At the same time a group of Neanderthals have left their destroyed home, a cave, they seem walk for miles in cold and warm weather. The leader of the Clan, Brun find Ayla lying along a path, she's  injured,  the leader  Brun, refuses to help the child, Iza the medicine woman and sister to Brun, wants to help the child. Brun objects, but he allows Iza to take the child. The Clan avoid The Others, a new tribal group moving into the land,  and  they take over more and more land. Most movies that I purchase don't put that Scene  Selection chart in the DVD box, I don't know why, it is so helpful to look up a particular scene, even on the DVD the Chapters are skimpy, limited. The major change for the leader is Brun's acceptance of Ayla, came when she found their new home, an old cave but a new home. Iza, is pregnant, her mate was killed  in the quake, he was a brute, violent, he is not missed, Iza has superior memory and talents handed down by her mother and her mother.
