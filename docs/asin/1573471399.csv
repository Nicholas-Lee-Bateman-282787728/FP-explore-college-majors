189131,A1LGDLGQXO4XO0,1573471399,Jackie Morton,"[0, 0]","I choose this rating because the book is good. What I like about the movie is that Andre Toulon's days before he became the Puppet Master were spent running an avant-garde puppet theatre in pre-World War I Paris and loving Ilsa, the beautiful daughter of the Swiss ambassador. When he witnesses the heinous murder of Afzel, an Egyptian sorcerer, who has stolen the ""Secret of Life"" from an ancient god, Sutekh, he is forced into a life and death struggle with the servants of Sutekh who have kidnapped Ilsa. In a final confrontation, Toulon and his puppets must make a stand against the deathless power of an ancient god in order to save the woman he loves.  What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.",5,Retro Puppet Master,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,771,"['choose', 'rating', 'book', 'good', 'What', 'like', 'movie', 'Andre', 'Toulon', 'days', 'became', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'were', 'spent', 'running', 'avant-garde', 'puppet', 'theatre', 'pre-World', 'War', 'Paris', 'loving', 'Ilsa', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Swiss', 'ambassador', 'When', 'heinous', 'murder', 'Afzel', 'Egyptian', 'sorcerer', 'who', 'stolen', 'Secret', 'Life', 'ancient', 'god', 'Sutekh', 'forced', 'life', 'death', 'struggle', 'servants', 'Sutekh', 'who', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'Ilsa', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Toulon', 'puppets', 'must', 'make', 'stand', 'deathless', 'power', 'ancient', 'god', 'order', 'save', 'woman', 'What', 'dislike', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'other', 'people']",N/A
189132,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,1573471399,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 2]","This seventh installment of a franchise that just doesn't seem to know when to stop could be described as no fun.  Maybe not as ""bad"" as part 6, but not as entertaining either.  At least part 6 had the WTF-factor that made me laugh.Director David DeCoteau (Curse of the Puppet Master, Puppet Master III) takes the helm again to dig the Puppet Master franchise's grave a few feet deeper with this unremarkable prequel, which opens as a sequel to Puppet Master III, which itself is a prequel to the first Puppet Master, but most of the story takes place before Puppet Master III, making it, at least in part, an...interquel?  Is that even a thing?In 1944, Toulon (Guy Rolfe; Parts 3-5) was planning to escape Germany with his puppets Blade (Parts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6), Pinhead (7 movie veteran), Tunneler (7 movie veteran), Jester (7 movie veteran) and Leech Woman (Parts 1, 2, 3 and 6).  So naturally, you'd think this movie is about their escape.  It's not.  Not at all.  Before bedtime, he decides to tell his puppets a story--the origin story of the franchise--and we never return to their escape from Germany.  So why even open with them escaping to Germany?So here's the story...In 1902 (Egypt), a man named Afzel is being pursued as a sorcerer by worshippers of Sutec.  You remember Sutec, right?  The evil Jim Henson demon lord from parts 4 and 5 who sent his antichrist only son to be reborn on Earth to kill Toulon's puppets and all who knew his secret.  When the worshippers fail, the demon God Sutec raises some mummies (that look like dudes in mummy Halloween costumes--way to go, make-up team!) to exact his revenge on the thief of the power of life.  Afzel flees to Paris, but is followed by Sutec's mummies, now made-over to look like goonish G-men with bad skin.Meanwhile young Toulon (Greg Sestero) is entertaining Parisians with his puppet shows.  After coming to the aid of Afzel, who we learn is a 3000 year old Egyptian sorcerer (despite looking like an old white dude--and they never explain how he lived so long since we are told he can only have eternal life if his soul is placed in an inanimate object), he proves his powers of eternal life by animating Toulon's puppets--which appear as crude (or ""retro"") versions of the puppets we know and love today, including Six-shooter (even though he wasn't in the opening storytelling scene).  There are also some new puppets (Dr. Death and Cyclops) which receive no explanation at all...huh?  Armed with death magic, Sutec's acolytes kill Toulon's puppet show crewmen.  But now armed with the power of eternal life, Toulon infuses their souls into his puppets.  Well aware that Toulon has bound their souls to these puppets, his crewmen don't seem to mind and are happy to fight Sutec's G-man mummies.  But let's just pause for a sec here!  What happens if the puppet is destroyed?  Is their once-immortal soul now also forever destroyed? Do they still get to go to Heaven?  Did this ""eternal life"" backdoor damn them to Hell?  I would have asked a few questions before signing up to fight an angry demon lord's sorcerous henchmen!  CONSEQUENCES OF ETERNAL LIFE FAIL.The effects team returned to some of their stop-motion roots, which was nice.  Sadly, the puppet violence was awful and there were no memorable kills--none.  Most deaths are attributed to Sutec's goons just waving their hands in the air and then people die in a blur of death magic that slowly makes them kneel and lay down...you know...as they're dying from the anticlimactic evil sorcery. DEATH MAGIC FAIL.  No build-up, no scares, no blood...no fun.  Worse yet, our two new puppets don't do anything?  I don't mean they don't have their own personalities or special ways to kill, which they don't.  I mean they don't do ANYTHING.  NEW PUPPET FAIL!!!In the end Toulon fails to reveal anything about the two new puppets.  He does, however, make reference to that being for ""another story.""  So I guess we'll just have to suffer through another sequel to find out.  Although, low and behold, part 8 doesn't even touch this notion.  DOUBLE NEW PUPPET FAIL.This whole movie could be described as no fun.  Maybe not as ""bad"" as part 6, but not as entertaining either.  At least part 6 had the WTF-factor that made me laugh when I wasn't rolling my eyes.Dare we move on to part 8...",2,This seventh installment of a franchise that just doesn't seem to know when to stop could be described as no fun.,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,4311,"['seventh', 'installment', 'franchise', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'fun', 'Maybe', 'not', 'bad', 'part', '6', 'not', 'entertaining', 'either', 'least', 'part', '6', 'had', 'WTF-factor', 'made', 'laugh.Director', 'David', 'DeCoteau', 'Curse', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'III', 'helm', 'again', 'dig', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'franchise', 'grave', 'few', 'feet', 'unremarkable', 'prequel', 'sequel', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'III', 'prequel', 'first', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'most', 'story', 'place', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'III', 'making', 'least', 'part', 'interquel', 'even', 'thing', '1944', 'Toulon', 'Guy', 'Rolfe', 'Parts', '3-5', 'was', 'planning', 'escape', 'Germany', 'puppets', 'Blade', 'Parts', '1', '2', '4', '5', '6', 'Pinhead', '7', 'movie', 'veteran', 'Tunneler', '7', 'movie', 'veteran', 'Jester', '7', 'movie', 'veteran', 'Leech', 'Woman', 'Parts', '1', '2', '3', '6', 'So', 'naturally', ""'d"", 'think', 'movie', 'escape', 'not', 'Not', 'bedtime', 'tell', 'puppets', 'story', 'origin', 'story', 'franchise', 'never', 'return', 'escape', 'Germany', 'So', 'why', 'even', 'open', 'escaping', 'Germany', 'So', 'here', 'story', '1902', 'Egypt', 'man', 'named', 'Afzel', 'being', 'pursued', 'sorcerer', 'worshippers', 'Sutec', 'remember', 'Sutec', 'right', 'evil', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'demon', 'lord', 'parts', '4', '5', 'who', 'sent', 'antichrist', 'only', 'son', 'be', 'reborn', 'Earth', 'kill', 'Toulon', 'puppets', 'who', 'knew', 'secret', 'When', 'worshippers', 'fail', 'demon', 'God', 'Sutec', 'mummies', 'look', 'dudes', 'mummy', 'Halloween', 'costumes', 'way', 'go', 'make-up', 'team', 'exact', 'revenge', 'thief', 'power', 'life', 'Afzel', 'Paris', 'followed', 'Sutec', 'mummies', 'now', 'made-over', 'look', 'goonish', 'G-men', 'bad', 'skin.Meanwhile', 'young', 'Toulon', 'Greg', 'Sestero', 'entertaining', 'Parisians', 'puppet', 'shows', 'coming', 'aid', 'Afzel', 'who', 'learn', '3000', 'year', 'old', 'Egyptian', 'sorcerer', 'looking', 'old', 'white', 'dude', 'never', 'explain', 'how', 'lived', 'so', 'long', 'are', 'told', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'eternal', 'life', 'soul', 'placed', 'inanimate', 'object', 'powers', 'eternal', 'life', 'animating', 'Toulon', 'puppets', 'appear', 'crude', 'retro', 'versions', 'puppets', 'know', 'love', 'today', 'including', 'Six-shooter', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'opening', 'storytelling', 'scene', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'puppets', 'Dr.', 'Death', 'Cyclops', 'receive', 'explanation', 'huh', 'Armed', 'death', 'magic', 'Sutec', 'acolytes', 'kill', 'Toulon', 'puppet', 'show', 'crewmen', 'now', 'armed', 'power', 'eternal', 'life', 'Toulon', 'souls', 'puppets', 'Well', 'Toulon', 'bound', 'souls', 'puppets', 'crewmen', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'are', 'happy', 'fight', 'Sutec', 'G-man', 'mummies', 'let', 'just', 'pause', 'sec', 'here', 'What', 'puppet', 'destroyed', 'once-immortal', 'soul', 'now', 'also', 'forever', 'destroyed', 'Do', 'still', 'get', 'go', 'Heaven', 'Did', 'eternal', 'life', 'backdoor', 'damn', 'Hell', 'would', 'have', 'asked', 'few', 'questions', 'signing', 'up', 'fight', 'angry', 'demon', 'lord', 'sorcerous', 'henchmen', 'CONSEQUENCES', 'OF', 'ETERNAL', 'LIFE', 'FAIL.The', 'effects', 'team', 'returned', 'stop-motion', 'roots', 'was', 'nice', 'Sadly', 'puppet', 'violence', 'was', 'awful', 'were', 'memorable', 'kills', 'none', 'Most', 'deaths', 'are', 'attributed', 'Sutec', 'goons', 'just', 'waving', 'hands', 'air', 'then', 'people', 'die', 'blur', 'death', 'magic', 'slowly', 'kneel', 'lay', 'down', 'know', ""'re"", 'dying', 'anticlimactic', 'evil', 'sorcery', 'DEATH', 'MAGIC', 'FAIL', 'build-up', 'scares', 'blood', 'fun', 'Worse', 'yet', 'two', 'new', 'puppets', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'own', 'personalities', 'special', 'ways', 'kill', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'ANYTHING', 'NEW', 'PUPPET', 'FAIL', 'end', 'Toulon', 'reveal', 'anything', 'two', 'new', 'puppets', 'however', 'make', 'reference', 'being', 'story', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'suffer', 'sequel', 'find', 'out', 'low', 'behold', 'part', '8', ""n't"", 'even', 'touch', 'notion', 'DOUBLE', 'NEW', 'PUPPET', 'FAIL.This', 'whole', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'fun', 'Maybe', 'not', 'bad', 'part', '6', 'not', 'entertaining', 'either', 'least', 'part', '6', 'had', 'WTF-factor', 'made', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'rolling', 'eyes.Dare', 'move', 'part', '8']",N/A
189133,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,1573471399,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 2]","To begin with, before I even watched this 7th film in the Puppet Master series, I had long given up on expecting anything half-way decent from the folks at Full Moon Video. With that said, I buckled down and forced myself to watch Retro Puppet Master. And what I got was more of the same cheesy crap that pretty much makes up most of the Puppet Master series. Much like the previous film, Curse of the Puppet Master, the only bright spot for this film was the original idea of the plot. This film is basically another prequel in which it shows the young Andre Toulon and how he originally discovered the secrets of bringing his puppets to life, and how he must save himself as well as the one he loves, Ilsa (in previous films, her name had been spelled Elsa, but who's counting?) from the evil servants of the Egyptian god Sutekh. Oh, and while I'm at it, is it worth mentioned that in the very first Puppet Master, Andre Toulon is shown killing myself in 1939. This ""flashback"" story told by Toulon takes place in 1944. Hmmm..I guess someone didn't do their homework! Now don't get me wrong, the story is pretty cheesy, but for this series, its a step up from some of the others as far as plot goes. But if one can look past the weak plot, it is impossible to  ignore the absolute HORRIBLE execution at making this film. The effects of the Puppet Master series has never  been that great, but with this film being made in 1999, and the series itself at this point being 10 years old, one would be inclined one to think that the advances in special effects and technology would help out a great deal with a film like this. But to extreme my disappointment, the effects in this film has got to be the worst in the series so far. The puppets in action looked like something a 10 year old kid could do in his spare time in his parent's basement! Not just that, but the effects of the ""powers"" used by the servants of Sutekh and the old man were just plain stupid looking. Are you telling me that this is the best they could have done? I don't think so, since the effects in the very first Puppet Master were 10 times better than this! As far as acting, I've seen worse, but again, there is some bad acting here. But it just wasn't the actors, the writing was at fault as well. Just some really bad dialog takes place here. For example, the repeating of lines by the three evil servants of Sutekh is just utterly dumb, and the few lines given to Toulon's puppeteer friends toward the beginning of the film is just plain bad. In closing, this is yet another really bad Puppet Master sequel. But like I said before, I had long since given up on this series and wasn't expecting much. This film has no redeeming qualities to cause anyone to watch it more than once, and is really not worth watching even once to begin with. With that said, there's no reason to buy this unless you need it to complete your Puppet Master series.",2,1.5 Stars: Yet Another Horrible Sequel...When will it end?,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,2921,"['begin', 'even', 'watched', '7th', 'film', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'series', 'had', 'long', 'given', 'up', 'expecting', 'anything', 'half-way', 'decent', 'folks', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Video', 'said', 'buckled', 'down', 'forced', 'watch', 'Retro', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'more', 'same', 'cheesy', 'crap', 'pretty', 'much', 'up', 'most', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'series', 'Much', 'previous', 'film', 'Curse', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'film', 'was', 'original', 'idea', 'plot', 'film', 'basically', 'prequel', 'young', 'Andre', 'Toulon', 'how', 'originally', 'discovered', 'secrets', 'bringing', 'puppets', 'life', 'how', 'must', 'save', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'Ilsa', 'previous', 'films', 'name', 'had', 'been', 'spelled', 'Elsa', 'who', 'counting', 'evil', 'servants', 'Egyptian', 'god', 'Sutekh', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'worth', 'mentioned', 'very', 'first', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'Andre', 'Toulon', 'shown', 'killing', '1939', 'flashback', 'story', 'told', 'Toulon', 'place', '1944', 'Hmmm..I', 'guess', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'homework', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'story', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'series', 'step', 'up', 'others', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'one', 'can', 'look', 'weak', 'plot', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'absolute', 'HORRIBLE', 'execution', 'making', 'film', 'effects', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'series', 'never', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'being', 'made', '1999', 'series', 'point', 'being', '10', 'years', 'old', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'one', 'think', 'advances', 'special', 'effects', 'technology', 'would', 'help', 'out', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'extreme', 'disappointment', 'effects', 'film', 'got', 'be', 'worst', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'puppets', 'action', 'looked', 'something', '10', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'could', 'do', 'spare', 'time', 'parent', 'basement', 'Not', 'just', 'effects', 'powers', 'used', 'servants', 'Sutekh', 'old', 'man', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'looking', 'Are', 'telling', 'best', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'effects', 'very', 'first', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'were', '10', 'times', 'better', 'As', 'far', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'again', 'bad', 'acting', 'here', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'actors', 'writing', 'was', 'fault', 'as', 'well', 'Just', 'really', 'bad', 'dialog', 'place', 'here', 'example', 'repeating', 'lines', 'three', 'evil', 'servants', 'Sutekh', 'just', 'utterly', 'dumb', 'few', 'lines', 'given', 'Toulon', 'puppeteer', 'beginning', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'closing', 'yet', 'really', 'bad', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'sequel', 'said', 'had', 'long', 'given', 'up', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'film', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'cause', 'anyone', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'really', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'once', 'begin', 'said', 'reason', 'buy', 'need', 'complete', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'series']",N/A
