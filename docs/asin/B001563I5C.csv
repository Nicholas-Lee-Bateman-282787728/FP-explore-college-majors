1148769,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001563I5C,Andrew Ellington,"[19, 23]","I really wanted to like this movie.  I remember when the buzz surrounding this movie started flooding in during the beginning of 2007 and everyone was predicting it for all kinds of awards beings that it was Kar Wai Wong's first English language film and the casting of singer songwriter Norah Jones in the lead role was particularly interesting.  I waited patiently for the buzz to turn into full-fledged madness but it seemed as if no sooner did the buzz begin then the buzz died and before I knew it the film wasn't even being released for a wide release and I had to wait until it was available on DVD before I could see it.  Regardless of the fact that it managed only one nomination (at Cannes mind you) I still really wanted to see this film, and so I did, and now that Cannes nomination baffles me, because `My Blueberry Nights' is very disappointing.`My Blueberry Nights' gets off to a sour start.  In fact for the first twenty minutes or so absolutely nothing happens.  We see Elizabeth, a frantic stalker-type ex-girlfriend going in and out of a bakery where she continues to ask the owner Jeremy if he has seen the man she was last in there with and they eat some pie and she watches some surveillance videos and cries and she gives him her keys to give to her ex and then she picks up and leaves town.  I know that sounds like a lot, but it's not when you watch it.  It's slow moving and rather vapid.In fact the whole movie feels rather vapid.There are a lot of critics who talk about Kar Wai Wong's infatuation with lovesickness, but I really didn't gather that here.  I saw glimpses of it, sure, but overall the feeling I was left with was more empty than fulfilled.  Sadly this was the first Kar Wai Wong film I have seen (but I do have `In the Mood for Love' in my Netflix queue) and I am left a little confused as to why this director is so lauded.  I will allow his other films to change my mind though.The acting is decent for the most part, excels in some areas and falls flat in others.  Norah Jones is beyond doubt a phenomenal singer and musician.  Her music touches my soul.  Her acting is uninspired and bland.  There is a part in the film when Faison's character says quite frankly to Weisz's character that he doesn't know what her ex-husband ever saw in her.  As he was speaking those words I was thinking the same thing, but about Jones's character, wondering how anyone could find her remotely interesting.  Her eyes are dead and she embodies no real emotion.  Jude Law is charming across the board; a little obnoxious in some areas but overall strong.  David Strathairn is stronger still as the alcoholic police officer Arnie.  His subtle outbursts within his own skin are far too good for the movie he inhabits.  Rachel Weisz is probably the most entertaining thing about this movie in the way that Thandie Newton is the most entertaining thing about `Crash'; a little uneven but uneven to perfection.  Natalie Portman is entertaining yet nothing impressive.  Her performance is decent, but doesn't really add anything to her character.I also found the incessant, repetitive use of Norah Jones's music throughout the beginning portion of the film to be rather unnecessary and annoying.By the time the film was wrapping up I was wondering what it was all about, what the whole purpose of this exercise was.  Sure, Elizabeth was supposed to find herself out on the road with all these people she doesn't understand and eventually realize that Jeremy is the one she wants to be with, but that point could have been delivered a little clearer and a little more interestingly.  I just found `My Blueberry Nights' to be a waste of talent and concept and apparently director, unless all of his films are like this and I'm just not intelligent enough to `get' them.",2,Could have been so much; became so little...,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,3791,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'remember', 'when', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'started', 'flooding', 'beginning', '2007', 'everyone', 'was', 'predicting', 'kinds', 'awards', 'beings', 'was', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'first', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'casting', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'waited', 'patiently', 'buzz', 'turn', 'full-fledged', 'madness', 'seemed', 'sooner', 'did', 'buzz', 'begin', 'then', 'buzz', 'died', 'knew', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'being', 'released', 'wide', 'release', 'had', 'wait', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'could', 'see', 'Regardless', 'fact', 'managed', 'only', 'one', 'nomination', 'Cannes', 'still', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'so', 'did', 'now', 'Cannes', 'nomination', 'baffles', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', 'very', 'disappointing.', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', 'sour', 'start', 'fact', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'happens', 'see', 'Elizabeth', 'frantic', 'stalker-type', 'ex-girlfriend', 'going', 'bakery', 'where', 'ask', 'owner', 'Jeremy', 'seen', 'man', 'was', 'last', 'eat', 'pie', 'surveillance', 'videos', 'cries', 'keys', 'give', 'ex', 'then', 'up', 'town', 'know', 'lot', 'not', 'when', 'watch', 'slow', 'moving', 'rather', 'vapid.In', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'feels', 'rather', 'are', 'lot', 'critics', 'who', 'talk', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'infatuation', 'lovesickness', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'gather', 'here', 'saw', 'glimpses', 'sure', 'feeling', 'was', 'left', 'was', 'more', 'empty', 'fulfilled', 'Sadly', 'was', 'first', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'do', 'have', 'Mood', 'Love', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'am', 'left', 'little', 'confused', 'why', 'director', 'so', 'lauded', 'will', 'allow', 'other', 'films', 'change', 'mind', 'though.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'most', 'part', 'excels', 'areas', 'flat', 'others', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'doubt', 'phenomenal', 'singer', 'musician', 'music', 'touches', 'soul', 'acting', 'uninspired', 'bland', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'Faison', 'character', 'quite', 'frankly', 'Weisz', 'character', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'ex-husband', 'ever', 'saw', 'was', 'speaking', 'words', 'was', 'thinking', 'same', 'thing', 'Jones', 'character', 'wondering', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'find', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'eyes', 'are', 'dead', 'real', 'emotion', 'Jude', 'Law', 'charming', 'board', 'little', 'obnoxious', 'areas', 'overall', 'strong', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'stronger', 'still', 'alcoholic', 'police', 'officer', 'Arnie', 'subtle', 'outbursts', 'own', 'skin', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'good', 'movie', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'probably', 'most', 'entertaining', 'thing', 'movie', 'way', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'most', 'entertaining', 'thing', 'Crash', 'little', 'uneven', 'uneven', 'perfection', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'nothing', 'impressive', 'performance', 'decent', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'character.I', 'also', 'found', 'incessant', 'repetitive', 'use', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'music', 'beginning', 'portion', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'unnecessary', 'annoying.By', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'wrapping', 'up', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'what', 'whole', 'purpose', 'exercise', 'was', 'Sure', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'supposed', 'find', 'out', 'road', 'people', ""n't"", 'understand', 'eventually', 'realize', 'Jeremy', 'one', 'be', 'point', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'delivered', 'little', 'clearer', 'little', 'more', 'interestingly', 'just', 'found', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', 'be', 'waste', 'talent', 'concept', 'apparently', 'director', 'films', 'are', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'get']",N/A

My Blueberry Nights is upbeat, harmonic, soulful, and has a strong sense of rhythm with improvised camera work (which can be a bit grating at times). The story is very basic, a girl deals with her heartbreak by visiting a pie shop and soon runs away from a potential romance by traveling across America where she meets offbeat characters while sending postcards to her potential love interest. The actors push a mediocre storyline into a kinda good movie, particularly Rachel Weisz, David Strathairn, and Natalie Portman.",3,Boring but slightly good,1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,638,"['extras', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'said', 'movie', 'out', 'jazz', 'song', 'think', 'accurate', 'description', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', 'upbeat', 'harmonic', 'soulful', 'strong', 'sense', 'rhythm', 'improvised', 'camera', 'work', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'grating', 'times', 'story', 'very', 'basic', 'girl', 'deals', 'heartbreak', 'visiting', 'pie', 'shop', 'soon', 'runs', 'away', 'potential', 'romance', 'traveling', 'America', 'where', 'offbeat', 'characters', 'sending', 'postcards', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'actors', 'push', 'mediocre', 'storyline', 'kinda', 'good', 'movie', 'particularly', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Natalie', 'Portman']",N/A
1148771,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B001563I5C,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","My Blueberry Nights is like a short story, but, to make a short story long, the characters come alive and the story gets longer. Indeed, it was based on an earlier short film by Chinese Director Kar Wai Wong. Maybe he should be called Kar Wai (so) Wong? It was just a short story's worth of film stretched out to 89 minutes. But actually, if you can get through it without falling asleep, it is pretty good. Kar Wai Wong likes to work without a specific script and he relies on his actors to flesh it out with improvisation.Since singer Norah Jones is no doubt familiar with improv, he chose her as the lead actress. She doesn't seem like such a great actor, but the role didn't call for much range. She is just sad and hopeful that some guy she met will come back, but you know nothing about him, and little else is revealed about her. She goes to a caf&eacute; and leaves some keys in a jar, and tells the caf&eacute; owner, Jeremy (Jude Law) to return them if he sees him again. She returns numerous times to the caf&eacute;, hoping for word about her man, but she also returns for the blueberry pie and conversation.=====================Elizabeth: So what's wrong with the Blueberry Pie?Jeremy: There's nothing wrong with the Blueberry Pie, just people make other choices. You can't blame the Blueberry Pie, it's just... no one wants it.Elizabeth: Wait! I want a piece.------------------------------It seems, however, that she is not the only one with keys in the jar, as Jeremy also does. So wrapped up is she in missing her man that she scarcely notices Jeremy, even as she derives tremendous comfort from the blueberry pie and the conversation. Eating blueberry pie and crying, one night she cries herself to sleep. There is vanilla ice cream on her lips, and then later there is none. Did Jeremy kiss her while she slept?Elizabeth takes off on a journey of self discovery that leads her West from New York, first to Memphis, where she meets a policeman (David Strathairn) also broken hearted for his young wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz). Their story is a little film-within-a-film, and it's a short story that really works.Next she heads out to Vegas, or more like a small town that has a casino or two--a small town outside of Vegas. Baker? Harumph? No, not Harumph. While working as a waitress, she meets Leslie (Natalie Portman), a gambler with daddy issues. She needs a stake to get back in the game, and offers Lizzie either her car, an expensive Jag, or a third of her winnings if she comes out ahead. It seems like Leslie did not win. Leslie says that she will give her the car, but she needs a ride first. While on the road the hospital calls and says her father wants to talk to her, that he might be dying. For some reason not fully explained, she hates her father. He is a gambler and taught her how to play cards. He used to brag to his cronies that she thought that Jack came after ten.==========Leslie: Sometimes your rhythm's off, you read the person right but still do the wrong thing.Lizzie: Because you trust them?Leslie: Because you can't even trust yourself.------------------Natalie does pretty well, but I've seen her do much better. Though she was having a bad hair day, there is a lot of chemistry between Lizzie and Leslie (not THAT much chemistry. Get your mind out of the gutter. Still, who came up with these names?). They just look like they are having a lot of fun together, two girls on the road.All the while, Lizzie keeps sending postcards to Jeremy. He realizes that he misses her, maybe he loves her. The postcards never include a return address, but he calls and sends out cards to every caf&eacute; and diner in the towns her cards are sent from hoping the shotgun approach will find her.Anyway, you get the idea. There are a lot of Norah haters out there, but she did OK. Kar Wai Wong really wanted her, and he built the movie around her. Her character wasn't a musician, and her dream, besides getting another slice of that blueberry pie, was just to buy a car. By making her character a mere waitress, they kind of left out the most interesting thing about her. I think that Norah Jones herself would make a better subject for a movie, and she could play herself. In it, a young girl sweeps The Grammies with a subtle blend of jazz and country, and backstage, for the first time, she meets her father, also a musician from India. Someone wanted to make that movie, but both father and daughter quashed it. Talk about daddy issues.Norah wrote one song for the film, and Cat Power, also in a small part, did another. Other music was by Ry Cooder. My Blueberry Nights had very lush cinematography by Darius Khondji, with lots of night shots and neon lights. It was a subtle and nuanced film that didn't give in to cynicism. I wish I could give it more than 3 stars, but it was Norah's first film, and Kar Wai Wong's first film in English, so it was a good first try.V for Vendetta (Widescreen Edition)(2005) ....

1148774,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B001563I5C,Cubist,"[2, 8]","For years, Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai has resisted the lure of the United States, content to make his films in his native country (with the exception ofHappy Togetherwhich was shot in South America) without any Hollywood movie stars. This has changed with My Blueberry Nights which Wong made in America with recognizable names like Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Natalie Portman, and in her feature film debut, singer Norah Jones. However, Wong hasn't exactly sold out - he made the film independently and it was then distributed by the Weinstein Company. Wong's film debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival to a less than favourable reaction and was quietly given a limited theatrical release and is now out on DVD.Sadly, there is no real chemistry between Norah Jones and Jude Law. It feels like Jones is just saying the lines and not living them. There is no emotional depth to her performance as she tries too hard to act and it shows. In addition, Law is simply not believable as a working class cafe owner. Rachel Weisz also seems miscast, like she's trying out for a boozy, foul-mouthed role in a production ofWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Two-Disc Special Edition)and ends up vamping it up way too self-consciously. Wong's weakness is his absolute need to cast beautifully looking people in his films and in this case it was the film's fatal flaw. Natalie Portman is well cast a smooth talking con artist and the only one (aside from David Strathairn) who looks comfortable in her role. With her curly, light brown hair and brash demeanor, she reminds one of Karen Mok in Wong'sFallen Angels.""The Making of My Blueberry Nights"" is your standard promotional featurette. Wong says that the film is based on a short film he made years ago and when he met Norah Jones in New York City, he decided to expand it into a film.

With good writing and acting, the characters are all engaging and three-dimensional, enough to make you care about them. Norah Jones - a wonderful singer - is very good in her first acting role here, portraying Elizabeth, the lead. Elizabeth discovers at a corner cafe in New York City that her boyfriend has been cheating on her. She leaves his keys there and returns several times afterward to see if he came back for them. Each time, she gets to know Jeremy (Jude Law), the cafe owner, more and more. Jeremy waxes philosophically over the many keys people have left there and the blueberry pie which is almost always left over at the end of the night.Clearly something begins to develop between Elizabeth and Jeremy; however, she is still working on getting over her ex-boyfriend. She moves across the country to Memphis, Tennessee where she goes by Lizzy. Trying to save money for a car and unable to sleep well, she gets two jobs - working at a diner during the day and a bar at night. At the bar she meets Arnie (David Strathairn), a policeman who is an alcoholic and cannot accept that he's separated from his wife. It's easy to feel sorry for Arnie, although it's clear he is flawed. Likewise, just when you might get to dislike his wife (Rachel Weisz), you learn to empathize with her situation too.While Jeremy tries all he can to reach Elizabeth in Memphis by mail or phone, she moves on to Nevada. Here she goes by Beth and gets a job at a small casino. She gets to know Leslie (Natalie Portman), a poker player who has lost all her money. Leslie convinces Beth to lend her all her car savings; if she wins, she'll share the winnings with Beth and if she loses, then she'll give Beth her new car. When she loses, Leslie says she can have the car but she needs a ride to Las Vegas to see her estranged father and borrow money. Along the road trip, the two get to know each other more. Again, Leslie has issues such as her inability to trust anyone, but there's still some good in her too.I enjoyed the characters and the story very much. My one criticism of the movie is the director's use of slow-motion. I felt it was unnecessary for the most part and he used it far too often toward the beginning of the movie. Otherwise, the movie was rather enjoyable. It included some wonderful music and nice cinematography. There was some humor, but for the most part it was a drama with some elements of romance.",4,Interesting character studies,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,2510,"['main', 'feature', 'film', 'are', 'characters', 'plot', 'almost', 'feels', 'secondary', 'good', 'writing', 'acting', 'characters', 'are', 'engaging', 'three-dimensional', 'enough', 'make', 'care', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'wonderful', 'singer', 'very', 'good', 'first', 'acting', 'role', 'here', 'portraying', 'Elizabeth', 'lead', 'Elizabeth', 'discovers', 'corner', 'cafe', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'boyfriend', 'been', 'cheating', 'keys', 'there', 'several', 'times', 'afterward', 'see', 'came', 'back', 'time', 'know', 'Jeremy', 'Jude', 'Law', 'cafe', 'owner', 'more', 'more', 'Jeremy', 'waxes', 'philosophically', 'many', 'keys', 'people', 'have', 'left', 'blueberry', 'pie', 'almost', 'always', 'left', 'over', 'end', 'night.Clearly', 'something', 'develop', 'Elizabeth', 'Jeremy', 'however', 'still', 'working', 'getting', 'over', 'ex-boyfriend', 'country', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee', 'where', 'Lizzy', 'Trying', 'save', 'money', 'car', 'unable', 'sleep', 'well', 'two', 'jobs', 'working', 'diner', 'day', 'bar', 'night', 'bar', 'Arnie', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'policeman', 'who', 'alcoholic', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'separated', 'wife', 'easy', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Arnie', 'clear', 'flawed', 'Likewise', 'just', 'when', 'might', 'get', 'dislike', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'learn', 'empathize', 'situation', 'too.While', 'Jeremy', 'all', 'can', 'reach', 'Elizabeth', 'Memphis', 'mail', 'phone', 'Nevada', 'Here', 'Beth', 'job', 'small', 'casino', 'know', 'Leslie', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'poker', 'player', 'who', 'lost', 'money', 'Leslie', 'Beth', 'lend', 'car', 'savings', ""'ll"", 'share', 'winnings', 'Beth', 'then', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Beth', 'new', 'car', 'When', 'Leslie', 'can', 'have', 'car', 'ride', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'see', 'estranged', 'father', 'borrow', 'money', 'road', 'trip', 'two', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'more', 'Again', 'Leslie', 'issues', 'such', 'inability', 'trust', 'anyone', 'still', 'good', 'too.I', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'criticism', 'movie', 'director', 'use', 'slow-motion', 'felt', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'most', 'part', 'used', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'included', 'wonderful', 'music', 'nice', 'cinematography', 'was', 'humor', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'drama', 'elements', 'romance']",N/A

If you examine the story close enough it doesn't hold water.  What further impedes the film is the casting of a neophyte actress, singer Norah Jones, in the lead role.  With her olive complexion and wide open orbs Jones certainly has the look of a movie star but like beauty itself her screen presence is only skin deep.

Such is the case in his first English language film MY BLUEBERRY NIGHTS, a creation he wrote (with Lawrence Block) as well as directed.  While the 'story' boasts a cast of fine actors, the emphasis seems less on character delineation than on creating a cinematic stream of consciousness.A New York Russian bakery/caf&eacute; is operated by immigrant Jeremy (Jude Law) and into this milieu comes the newly jilted Elizabeth (Norah Jones - who also provides much of he sound track singing for the film).  She leaves her boyfriend's keys with Jeremy as a sign of resignation but continues to nightly check to see if her ex-boyfriend has shown up to claim them. This is the premise for the formation of a bond between Jeremy and Elizabeth, but without solidifying that bond, Elizabeth runs off to greener pastures.  She settles in Tennessee where she finds work as both a waitress and a bar maid and meets the down and out alcoholic policeman Arlo (David Strathairn) who pines away for his tacky, gallivanting wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz).  Leaving that story piece unresolved, Elizabeth then moves to Las Vegas where she becomes friends with a young, loser gambler Leslie (Natalie Portman) who manages to waste Elizabeth's savings for a car on yet another misjudged gambling night.  Through this cavalcade of losers Elizabeth continues to write postcards to Jeremy and the ending is blatantly predictable.There are some moments of memorable dialog: 'Sometimes, even if you have the keys those doors still can't be opened. Can they? '  'Even if the door is open, the person you're looking for may not be there'.  But for the most part this is a visual feast for those who love Kar Wai Wong's genre.  The plot is thin as is the dialogue and the actors work to make the most of the outlines of conversation that they embellish with their own spontaneous words.  If it feels improvised to the viewer then the viewer has entered the realm of Kar Wai Wong.  This is a film for art film lovers - it is very beautiful to watch!

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Even though I have Wong Kar-Wai's biggest, and most notable, films on my DVD shelves thanks to the Criterion Collection--I must admit that ""My Blueberry Nights"" escaped my notice upon its release. It's particularly strange considering the top line talent of Jude Law, Natalie Portman, David Strathairn, and Rachel Wiesz (any one of which, on their own, might have been a draw for me) headlining the cast. ""My Blueberry Nights,"" as you might have surmised by the actors, is an English language film that utilizes many of the trademark elements of Wong Kar-Wai's previous efforts. The film's quiet introspection and melancholia are offset by a certain voyeuristic allure brought about in the cinematography. It's a lovely film to look at--but the narrative seems a bit slight at the end of the day.With all the great talent in the cast, it's an unusual choice to put singer Norah Jones in the lead. The film brings Jones and Law together in a New York eatery as Jones is reeling from a broken relationship. The two meet regularly and become friends and speak philosophically about pie amongst other metaphorical topics. Before you can say ""See ya...,"" Jones is off to Memphis where she befriends a drunken police officer (Strathairn) tragically coping with the disintegration of his marriage to Weisz. When this concludes, Jones heads further west to meet up with itinerant gambler Portman for some additional life lessons. Each of the stops provides some nice moments--Weisz is particularly lively--but by the time Jones is headed back to the Big Apple, I'm not sure any larger meaning stuck with me.In and of itself, I might have been fine with that as well. I suppose my primary lack of interest in ""My Blueberry Nights"" comes from the casting of Norah Jones herself. Jones is strangely expressionless and monotone and, yet, every major character in the film is drawn to her. I would rather have spent more time with anyone else in this film!

1148788,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B001563I5C,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 8]","What I like most about ""My Blueberry Nights"" is the great soundtrack albumMy Blueberry Nights.  Wong Kar-Wai who won an award at Cannes forHappy Togetherdirected his first English language film.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well.  Jude Law is always interesting to watch for me.  His two Oscar nominations for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Cold Mountain"" gave much better stories and characters than does this film.  Darius Khondji, the Oscar nominee for ""Evita,"" does stunning work with the cinematography.  However, time lapse photography of ice cream melting on a blueberry pie might make me hungry, but it doesn't compensate for the lack of a story.  Law's Jeremy and Norah Jones' Elizabeth seem like they are destined to become romantically linked.  After nights in the pie shop, Jones takes off which takes her to several locations.  Rachel Weisz who won a supporting Oscar & Golden Globe for ""The Constant Gardener"" plays the sleazy wife Sue Lynne to David Strathairn's boozy policeman.  I actually liked Strathairn more in this film than in his Oscar nominated performance for ""Good Night & Good Luck""  He has such an unrequited love and such a tragic demise.  Down the road, Elizabeth runs into Natalie Portman's gambler character who seems juvenile, untrustworthy and spoiled.  However, Jones can't hold her own in frame with Portman and the film loses its path, as it seems to take a rabbit trail rather than illuminating the Elizabeth-Jeremy story.  Chan Marshall shows up as Jeremy's ex.  The big change in the movie comes as Jeremy tosses a jar of keys he'd been keeping at the diner.  While this film is handsomely filmed with good-looking talented actors and has a great soundtrack, it's rather awkward as a film, going nowhere slowly.

1148789,ABF9TML1GLCJ6,B001563I5C,Luca,"[39, 52]","There is much in Wong Kar-Wai's first all English production to admire, but the cast, the dialogue, and the translation of Asian aesthetics unto accent-dimmed performances is so pronounced we have no option but to enjoy the movie solely for its artistic merit while lamenting its prosaic shortcomings. The usual antics and brilliance of the director are all deployed to a whimsical effectiveness, if sometimes deliberately indulged. The usual close-ups and askance visual is present frame after frame, with opaque intrusions, slantwise peering, obstructed lavishness, and aided by the diner/pub setting the movie is infused with neon latency. In fact the plot is simple and very bleak. Action hardly ever takes place during the day, save for the occasional interlude which seems to be a way to mark as pronounced the comparative glare that the night offers. At times we have the camera slide its intensity along a bar or a table, stolidly stuck on a fork pricking through a slice of pie, or meandering about the outskirts of a bar, column after column, shadows crawling senselessly through a disorderly tension that seems innocent enough to hide behind the crevices of our visual. Overall the very Asian aesthetic quality of the camerawork tellingly foreshadows a candor that has us become voyeurs more so than spectators. In Asian culture it is best not to invade one's private space and here it is carried out to such beauty that it offers a sense of indiscreet respect.Where the movie falters however is in its casting, of which some are excellent artists used in a middling unfortunate fashion. Jude Law and Natalie Portman are sensational actors but oddly cast in the drama. Their intensity is unique but too forceful for the narrative introspective layover. The graceful Norah Jones is very mediocre. She has promise but the flick rests too much on her inner turmoil to be successful since she cannot be the keystone of the narrative in a way to match the intensity and bravado of her colleagues. The story is very simple. Elizabeth is stuck on her boyfriend whose just broken-up with her. She will have to labor through her incredulousness and inability to let go. The diner's owner, played by Jude Law offers her a shoulder and an ear while terribly straining the poetic attitude of the atmosphere by introducing a dialogue that metaphor driven closes the doors it chances to open. In fact while observing the action from behind window panes or timidly joining the session while tip-toeing about a door left ajar we discover a tenuous delicacy of touch that is as fragile as Norah Jones' performance.David Strathairn, cast as Arnie, the alcoholic policeman who cannot let go of his wife, strikes a rapport of morbid proportions with Lizzie. While on a lovelorn escapade to Memphis, Lizzie nurses her loss and begins to recover, but in the process as she learns to give up, somehow that same sense of absence transfers to Arnie who is separated from a wife who wants nothing to do with him. The perfection of his character study and depth only highlights the misses of the others, including Arnie's estranged wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz). Arnie gives up on a night of madness and overglowing anger but determines to commit suicide. Enters Natalie Portman, a southern vixen with a penchant for gambling.The neon-hued camerawork receives added sheen from a trip to Vegas on a brand new Jaguar, only to find out that the every win is also a loss. Ultimately that is the upshot of the narrative which is brightly demented by the braggadocio devil-may care sensibility of Leslie (Natalie Portman). The death of Leslie's father causes a reunion between Lizzie and the diner's proprietor Jeremy, who functions as the jar of sweets everyone is sure with due time Lizzie will find her way to. Time spent through glowing hues that distil an aura of hopeless references and tame performances that jarr all the more because uninspired while beset by the contrasting tenderness of the visual.A movie worth watching, because of the addictive intensity provided by the camerawork of Darius Khondji, but the elegiac tone of a ""Chungking Express"" or ""In the Mood for Love"" is affected by the sobering vapidity of a plot that plays with the notion of loss and gain by using a maudlin dialogue and a cloyed, exhausted attempt at allegorizing by way of sappy, overburdened poetics.",3,Neon Bright Infusion,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,4369,"['much', 'Wong', 'Kar-Wai', 'first', 'English', 'production', 'admire', 'cast', 'dialogue', 'translation', 'Asian', 'aesthetics', 'accent-dimmed', 'performances', 'so', 'pronounced', 'have', 'option', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'solely', 'artistic', 'merit', 'lamenting', 'prosaic', 'shortcomings', 'usual', 'antics', 'brilliance', 'director', 'are', 'deployed', 'whimsical', 'effectiveness', 'sometimes', 'deliberately', 'indulged', 'usual', 'close-ups', 'askance', 'visual', 'present', 'frame', 'frame', 'opaque', 'intrusions', 'slantwise', 'peering', 'obstructed', 'lavishness', 'aided', 'diner/pub', 'setting', 'movie', 'infused', 'neon', 'latency', 'fact', 'plot', 'simple', 'very', 'bleak', 'Action', 'hardly', 'ever', 'place', 'day', 'save', 'occasional', 'interlude', 'be', 'way', 'mark', 'pronounced', 'comparative', 'glare', 'night', 'offers', 'times', 'have', 'camera', 'slide', 'intensity', 'bar', 'table', 'stolidly', 'stuck', 'fork', 'pricking', 'slice', 'pie', 'meandering', 'outskirts', 'bar', 'column', 'column', 'crawling', 'senselessly', 'disorderly', 'tension', 'innocent', 'enough', 'hide', 'crevices', 'visual', 'very', 'Asian', 'aesthetic', 'quality', 'camerawork', 'tellingly', 'candor', 'become', 'voyeurs', 'more', 'so', 'spectators', 'Asian', 'culture', 'best', 'not', 'invade', 'one', 'private', 'space', 'here', 'carried', 'such', 'beauty', 'sense', 'indiscreet', 'respect.Where', 'movie', 'falters', 'however', 'casting', 'are', 'excellent', 'artists', 'used', 'middling', 'unfortunate', 'fashion', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'are', 'sensational', 'actors', 'oddly', 'cast', 'drama', 'intensity', 'unique', 'too', 'forceful', 'narrative', 'introspective', 'layover', 'graceful', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'very', 'mediocre', 'promise', 'flick', 'too', 'much', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'be', 'successful', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'keystone', 'narrative', 'way', 'match', 'intensity', 'bravado', 'colleagues', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'Elizabeth', 'stuck', 'boyfriend', 'just', 'broken-up', 'will', 'have', 'labor', 'incredulousness', 'inability', 'let', 'go', 'diner', 'owner', 'played', 'Jude', 'Law', 'shoulder', 'ear', 'terribly', 'straining', 'poetic', 'attitude', 'atmosphere', 'introducing', 'dialogue', 'metaphor', 'driven', 'doors', 'open', 'fact', 'observing', 'action', 'window', 'panes', 'timidly', 'joining', 'session', 'tip-toeing', 'door', 'left', 'ajar', 'discover', 'tenuous', 'delicacy', 'touch', 'as', 'fragile', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'performance.David', 'Strathairn', 'cast', 'Arnie', 'alcoholic', 'policeman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'wife', 'rapport', 'morbid', 'proportions', 'Lizzie', 'lovelorn', 'escapade', 'Memphis', 'Lizzie', 'loss', 'recover', 'process', 'give', 'up', 'somehow', 'same', 'sense', 'absence', 'transfers', 'Arnie', 'who', 'separated', 'wife', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'perfection', 'character', 'study', 'depth', 'only', 'misses', 'others', 'including', 'Arnie', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Sue', 'Lynne', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Arnie', 'up', 'night', 'madness', 'overglowing', 'anger', 'determines', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Enters', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'southern', 'vixen', 'penchant', 'gambling.The', 'neon-hued', 'camerawork', 'added', 'sheen', 'trip', 'Vegas', 'brand', 'new', 'Jaguar', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'win', 'also', 'loss', 'Ultimately', 'upshot', 'narrative', 'brightly', 'demented', 'braggadocio', 'devil-may', 'care', 'sensibility', 'Leslie', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'death', 'Leslie', 'father', 'reunion', 'Lizzie', 'diner', 'proprietor', 'Jeremy', 'who', 'jar', 'sweets', 'everyone', 'sure', 'due', 'time', 'Lizzie', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'Time', 'spent', 'glowing', 'hues', 'distil', 'aura', 'hopeless', 'references', 'tame', 'performances', 'jarr', 'more', 'because', 'uninspired', 'beset', 'contrasting', 'tenderness', 'visual.A', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'addictive', 'intensity', 'provided', 'camerawork', 'Darius', 'Khondji', 'elegiac', 'tone', 'Chungking', 'Express', 'Mood', 'Love', 'affected', 'sobering', 'vapidity', 'plot', 'notion', 'loss', 'gain', 'using', 'maudlin', 'dialogue', 'cloyed', 'exhausted', 'attempt', 'allegorizing', 'way', 'sappy', 'overburdened', 'poetics']",N/A

Zwick,"[2, 4]","***1/2Despite its status as a low-budget, independent feature, ""My Blueberry Nights"" boasts a roster of A-list players - Jude Law, David Strathairn, Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman - that any mainstream filmmaker would consider it a privilege to work with.In her big screen acting debut, singer Norah Jones plays Elizabeth, a beautiful young woman from New York who, after her boyfriend dumps her, decides to head out across the country to try and forget about her past and make a new life for herself.  Working as a waitress in Memphis and the Desert Southwest, Lizzie meets up with a variety of colorful characters, including Strathairn as an alcoholic cop, Weisz as the wife who`s been cheating on him, and Portman as a compulsive gambler who lures Lizzie into one of her schemes.  In addition, Law plays a caf&eacute; owner back in the city who introduces Lizzie to the delights of blueberry pie and who serves as the letter-writing confidante and emotional focal point the wayward young lady needs while she's off on her travels.As conceived by director Wong Kar Wai and co-writer Lawrence Block, the vignettes aren't all that terribly interesting, actually, but the artful look and tone give the film a hip, sophisticated flavor.  And since Lizzie is pretty much just a passive observer of  the dramas that unfold around her, we don`t become as emotionally invested in the characters as we might had she been allowed to become a more proactive force in the narrative - though we're willing to concede that this approach might well have been necessitated by Jones` neophyte status as an actor.  Her work here isn`t bad, by any means, but then she isn't called upon to do much more than react to the people and events around her.  As a result, it's still probably way too soon to make any kind of definitive prediction regarding her future as an actress.Still, the contemplative, lyrical mood of the film and the sometimes astute and touching observations it makes about both the good and bad aspects of relationships turn ""My Blueberry Nights"" - its episodic nature notwithstanding - into an enjoyable, if minor, triumph for Wai and his gifted cast.",3,"appealing, if not overly distinguished, indie romance",1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,2155,"['***1/2Despite', 'status', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'feature', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', 'roster', 'A-list', 'players', 'Jude', 'Law', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'mainstream', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'consider', 'privilege', 'work', 'with.In', 'big', 'screen', 'acting', 'debut', 'singer', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'Elizabeth', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'head', 'out', 'country', 'try', 'forget', 'past', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'herself', 'Working', 'waitress', 'Memphis', 'Desert', 'Southwest', 'Lizzie', 'up', 'variety', 'colorful', 'characters', 'including', 'Strathairn', 'alcoholic', 'cop', 'Weisz', 'wife', 'who', 's', 'been', 'cheating', 'Portman', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'who', 'Lizzie', 'one', 'schemes', 'addition', 'Law', 'caf', 'eacute', 'owner', 'back', 'city', 'who', 'Lizzie', 'delights', 'blueberry', 'pie', 'who', 'letter-writing', 'confidante', 'emotional', 'focal', 'point', 'wayward', 'young', 'lady', 'needs', 'off', 'travels.As', 'conceived', 'director', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'co-writer', 'Lawrence', 'Block', 'vignettes', 'are', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'interesting', 'actually', 'artful', 'look', 'tone', 'give', 'film', 'hip', 'sophisticated', 'flavor', 'Lizzie', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'passive', 'observer', 'dramas', 'unfold', 'don', 't', 'become', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'characters', 'might', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'become', 'more', 'proactive', 'force', 'narrative', ""'re"", 'willing', 'concede', 'approach', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'necessitated', 'Jones', 'neophyte', 'status', 'actor', 'work', 'here', 'isn', 't', 'bad', 'means', 'then', ""n't"", 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'react', 'people', 'events', 'result', 'still', 'probably', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'make', 'kind', 'definitive', 'prediction', 'regarding', 'future', 'actress.Still', 'contemplative', 'lyrical', 'mood', 'film', 'sometimes', 'astute', 'touching', 'observations', 'good', 'bad', 'aspects', 'relationships', 'turn', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', 'episodic', 'nature', 'notwithstanding', 'enjoyable', 'minor', 'triumph', 'Wai', 'gifted', 'cast']",N/A

He listens to everything she says and is part friend, part psychiatrist and part restaurant owner. The two share a bond of sorts and he also reveals details of his own previous relationships. He keeps her keys in a jar with countless others and Elizabeth learns that he knows the story behind each set.Jeremy also talks to her about food, explaining what sells well and what doesn't. He offers her blueberry pie and ice cream and mentions that the blueberry pie is often untouched at the end of the day. There's nothing wrong with it, but people just make other choices. I think Wong Kar-Wai is comparing people to food with that observation. There's nothing wrong with Elizabeth or Jeremy, but both are alone.The camera on the diner wall serves as Jeremy's diary. He likes to watch the recordings at the end of the day to see what he's missed. Wong Kar-Wai's camera doesn't miss anything. When Jeremy and Elizabeth are talking, we see them from afar. There's often a counter or something in the way of the camera so that we feel like voyeurs, spying on an intimate conversation. Other notable techniques include the use of vivid colors and the blurring of motion, as well as slow motion and images which are sped up. Wong Kar-Wai uses the same techniques in other films such as Chungking Express and Fallen Angels.Without declaring anything, it becomes obvious that Jeremy and Elizabeth care about each other. But Elizabeth seems wary of relationships after her recent experiences and decides to take some time to think about what she really wants. She works in various bars and diners and eventually winds up in Memphis. It's there that she meets Arnie (Strathairn), who drinks in her bar. She listens to Arnie, talks about her dreams and gives him advice. I like Strathairn's performance and consider him one of the most interesting characters in the film. Is it a coincidence that Elizabeth becomes someone who will listen to people's problems, just as Jeremy did with her?Elizabeth writes to Jeremy regularly, but never reveals her address or phone number. He misses her and tries randomly calling bars and diners to find her. Later, he decides to send postcards, and ends up sending hundreds.Elizabeth rarely stays in one place for long and has a series of adventures. The most prominent one happens when she encounters Leslie (Portman), who plays poker for high stakes. Elizabeth learns more about herself as the film progresses, especially from Leslie.Will Elizabeth and Jeremy ever meet again? I won't reveal that here.Norah Jones did a great job on her acting debut. The story is stylish, intimate and a little unconventional. If you like other Wong Kar-Wai films, you'll almost certainly like this. Ry Cooder's score is incredible and perfectly matches the mood. There are some other well-placed songs, especially the two haunting numbers from Cat Power. If you're a fan of Cat Power, look out for a cameo appearance by Chan Marshall.Video Quality 4.5/5Optimum's Blu-ray presentation looks great. The stylized color scheme is striking and the detail strong. There are no obvious problems such as dirt or print damage. The film looks clean and almost perfect. Any blurring is purely intentional and a regular occurrence in Wong Kar-Wai's films.Audio Quality 4.5/5The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track delivered everything I hoped for. Although the film is primarily a dialogue-heavy story, the use of music enhances the atmosphere. Cooder's guitar is wonderful and the other songs all come across well. You won't have to strain to hear any of the dialogue and I couldn't detect any faults in the mix.Special Features 3/510,279 Miles Since Hong Kong: My Blueberry Nights - A good ""making of"" feature with cast and crew.Cannes Press Conference - Director Wong Kar-Wai and actress Norah Jones face the Cannes media.Character Study - A short piece featuring comments from cast and crew.Theatrical TrailerMy Blueberry Nights will appeal to lovers of film for its interesting use of color and unusual camera angles. It's a romance of a sort, but less conventional than most. Some of the discussions will stay with you if you're the sort of person who analyzes what you have just seen. Fans of Wong Kar-Wai shouldn't hesitate. If this is your first Wong Kar-Wai film and you liked it, Chungking Express is well worth checking out. I consider it his masterpiece.Overall score 4/5",4,A delicious morsel served up by Wong Kar-Wai,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,5401,"['Blueberry', 'Nights', 'drama', 'romance', 'Directed', 'Wong',
