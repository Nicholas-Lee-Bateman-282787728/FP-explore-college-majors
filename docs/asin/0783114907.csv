That was enough for me.""Hollywood took all the dramatic liberties and artistic license it could in the making of this movie.  Jessica Lange's performance is one of her best but her watching her lip-synch while Cline's real voice was heard on the Soundtrack is distracting as their voices are entirely different. Lange tends to overdo it on the lip-syching and one can tell she is doing it.  Not good.  No disrespect to Lange but they should have hired an actress who could sing....like Sissy Spacek who sang all of Loretta Lynn's songs on ""Coal Miner's Daughter.""Ed Harris plays Charlie Dick well enough but is extremely unlikeable.  It is inacurrate at all counts to portray him as a wife-beater.  Sure, Patsy had Charlie arrested a couple of times but their relationship was NOT as volatile as portrayed here.  Ask any of Patsy's contemporaries who are still alive...they will corroborate this.Many inacurracies taken on this film.  Instead of making it ""Patsy and Charlie focused"" they should have done better by portraying Patsy's struggles to rise to fame in her career.....she went through a lot before she finally hit it big.  This is glossed over and given minute status in the film.The plane crash was over-dramatized and totally inacurrate.  It happened at night during a rainstorm....not during the day and the motor did not conk out prior to the crash!I would have like to have seen more interaction between Patsy and her siblings as well.  There was almost none except the car crash (also inaccurately depicted) with her brother and none with her sister Sylvia (a simple presentation of a gift for her high school graduation doesn't count).The best things about this film are:1.  Ann Wedgeworth's portrayal of HIlda Hensley, Patsy's mother.  SHe is superb!!  SHe should have at least gotten an Oscar nomination for her portrayal.  She steals every scene she's in.2.  The recreation of the Grand Ole OPry.3.  The Music...the Soundtrack....great.There is extreme profanity and sexual content in this film.

43576,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,0783114907,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[0, 0]","Before I saw ""Sweet Dreams,"" I knew that Patsy Cline had a string of country-pop hits like ""I Fall To Pieces"" and ""Crazy""; and I knew that she died in a tragic plane crash in 1963. After I saw this movie, I was hooked-- a Patsy Cline fan for life!This movie seems rather obviously inspired by the earlier success of Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn in ""Coal Miner's Daughter."" In ""Daughter,"" Beverly D'Angelo played Patsy Cline and sang her own vocals. As good as D'Angelo was, (she received an Oscar nomination) you won't miss her here. Jessica Lange gives a full-bodied performance. She is not required to sing. What actress, no matter how talented, could hope to match the incomparable emotion and sound of Patsy Cline's singing voice? Instead, Jessica Lange lip-sinc's to Patsy Cline's vocals-- to absolute perfection; in much the same manner as Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis lip-sinced to Judy Garland's legendary vocals in the superior 2001 TV biopic ""Me And My Shadows: Life With Judy Garland.""Karel Reisz's  1985  biopic is very selective about which aspects of Patsy's life are depicted. None of Patsy's friends, such as Loretta Lynn, are portrayed here. Spanning 1956-1963, the movie focuses firmly on Patsy's struggle to the top of the music  charts and her tumultuous, violent  marriage to Charlie Dick. Ed Harris matches Lange in intensity all the way as heavy drinking, hard partying Charlie. The film depicts Patsy and Charlie as living, loving, and fighting with a passion. Ann Wedgeworth gives a strong supporting performance as Hilda Hensley, Patsy's mother, and John Goodman (from ""Roseanne"" and Lange's TV version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"") appears as one of Charlie's drinking buddies.I love how  Jessica Lange portrays Patsy as a spirited,  vulnerable, but extremely vibrant woman who seldom takes ""stuff"" from anybody.  Like Sissy Spacek and Beverly D'Angelo before her, Jessica Lange received a much deserved Oscar nomination; and this is my favorite of Jessica Lange's movies and performances.  When Charlie first sees her, he says, ""Hey, I want you to get your coat, get in my car so we can get to know each other."" Patsy instantly responds, ""You want a lot, don't ya. Well, people in hell want ice water. That don't mean they get it!"" She describes Charlie to her mother as ""some clown with hot britches."" Encountering Charlie for the second time at a bar, shrewd Patsy sizes him up perfectly, saying she knows exactly what he wants in the backseat of his car.Much later, when Charlie lamely tries to explain why their house is a drunken mess, an exhausted Patsy (she has returned home from touring on the road) replies, ""Obviouly, you've got me confused with someone who gives a s##%%t.""Patsy says she wants it all, and the film takes the firm position that Patsy definitely deserved to have it all. As we watch the film, we root for Patsy to succeed in her music career, in life, and in love. Reality is, of course, much uglier than that.  Patsy may have wished for a house with yellow roses, but her life was definitely not a bed of roses. The worst thing about the script (traveling down an overly-familiar show-business biopic path) is that we see, or already know well, where it is going. The film may soften people and events, but it never completely sanitizes them for audience comfort.  Scenes of  drunken Charlie beating Patsy up,  and the plane crash that killed Patsy and three others, are harrowing to watch. However, our knowledge of the bittersweet facts of Patsy Cline's life gives the intense performances an undercurrent of heartbreaking sadness. You will never forget Patsy Cline's incredible voice  or Jessica Lange's  incredible performance.",4,BITTERSWEET BIOPIC OF PATSY CLINE,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,3690,"['saw', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'knew', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'had', 'string', 'country-pop', 'hits', 'Fall', 'Pieces', 'Crazy', 'knew', 'died', 'tragic', 'plane', 'crash', '1963', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'hooked', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'fan', 'life', 'movie', 'rather', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'earlier', 'success', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Loretta', 'Lynn', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'Daughter', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'played', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'sang', 'own', 'vocals', 'As', 'good', ""D'Angelo"", 'was', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'here', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'full-bodied', 'performance', 'not', 'required', 'sing', 'What', 'actress', 'matter', 'how', 'talented', 'could', 'hope', 'match', 'incomparable', 'emotion', 'sound', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'singing', 'voice', 'Instead', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'lip-sinc', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'vocals', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'much', 'same', 'manner', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'lip-sinced', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'legendary', 'vocals', 'superior', '2001', 'TV', 'biopic', 'Me', 'My', 'Shadows', 'Life', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Karel', 'Reisz', '1985', 'biopic', 'very', 'selective', 'aspects', 'Patsy', 'life', 'are', 'depicted', 'None', 'Patsy', 'friends', 'such', 'Loretta', 'Lynn', 'are', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Spanning', '1956-1963', 'movie', 'firmly', 'Patsy', 'struggle', 'top', 'music', 'charts', 'tumultuous', 'violent', 'marriage', 'Charlie', 'Dick', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'matches', 'Lange', 'intensity', 'way', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'hard', 'partying', 'Charlie', 'film', 'Patsy', 'Charlie', 'living', 'loving', 'fighting', 'passion', 'Ann', 'Wedgeworth', 'strong', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Hilda', 'Hensley', 'Patsy', 'mother', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Roseanne', 'Lange', 'TV', 'version', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'one', 'Charlie', 'drinking', 'buddies.I', 'love', 'how', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Patsy', 'spirited', 'vulnerable', 'extremely', 'vibrant', 'woman', 'who', 'stuff', 'anybody', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'received', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'favorite', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'movies', 'performances', 'When', 'Charlie', 'first', 'Hey', 'want', 'get', 'coat', 'get', 'car', 'can', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'Patsy', 'instantly', 'want', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'ya', 'Well', 'people', 'hell', 'want', 'ice', 'water', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'get', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'clown', 'hot', 'britches', 'Encountering', 'Charlie', 'second', 'time', 'bar', 'shrewd', 'Patsy', 'up', 'perfectly', 'saying', 'exactly', 'what', 'backseat', 'car.Much', 'later', 'when', 'Charlie', 'lamely', 'explain', 'why', 'house', 'drunken', 'mess', 'exhausted', 'Patsy', 'returned', 'home', 'touring', 'road', 'Obviouly', ""'ve"", 'got', 'confused', 'someone', 'who', 's', '%', '%', 't', 'Patsy', 'film', 'firm', 'position', 'Patsy', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'root', 'Patsy', 'succeed', 'music', 'career', 'life', 'love', 'Reality', 'course', 'much', 'uglier', 'Patsy', 'may', 'have', 'wished', 'house', 'yellow', 'roses', 'life', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'bed', 'roses', 'worst', 'thing', 'script', 'traveling', 'down', 'overly-familiar', 'show-business', 'biopic', 'path', 'see', 'already', 'know', 'well', 'where', 'going', 'film', 'may', 'soften', 'people', 'events', 'never', 'completely', 'audience', 'comfort', 'Scenes', 'drunken', 'Charlie', 'beating', 'Patsy', 'up', 'plane', 'crash', 'killed', 'Patsy', 'three', 'others', 'are', 'harrowing', 'watch', 'However', 'knowledge', 'bittersweet', 'facts', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'life', 'intense', 'performances', 'undercurrent', 'heartbreaking', 'sadness', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'incredible', 'voice', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'incredible', 'performance']",Sweet Dreams

(The most notable fact being that Cline looked much more like Bette Midler than Jessica Lange.)But the point was never about how she mistakenly married a wife-beating weasel or what she said just before she made a big smudge on a mountain somewhere. (By the way, why was there a ""benefit for a disc jockey"" that Cline's ill-fated plane had to go to, anyway? Didn't DJ's make enough big money even back then?) But all that matters is that this movie points new fans to the incredible sound stylings of Cline herself.And the producers thankfully opted to keep only Cline's original tunes in this one, instead of putting Lange through some forced vocal training to imitate her. Cline could never be completely imitated anyway, and decades later we can see that her quality still endures. Sure, we'll never forget other swingin' young '50s and early '60s country and/or pop stars, like Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Bobby Darrin. And Patsy was one of 'em too!Maybe one other point does need restating anyway, at the risk of being too obvious - hey, entertainers - whenever possible, stay the heck out of airplanes!

43583,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0783114907,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[23, 28]","Reality is generally more complicated than any motion picture can possibly convey--and such is the case with SWEET DREAMS, the 1985 bio-pic of singer Patsy Cline, which ran into a firestorm of criticism at the time of its release.  For Patsy Cline was not a figure from the remote past.  She and her life were extremely well recalled by family, friends, and co-workers, and one and all attacked the film as an extremely inaccurate portrait of her, her husband Charlie, and her life and career.To a certain extent, the validity of these complaints about the film are a matter of opinion.  But it does seem likely that the script softened Cline's harder edges and over-emphasized the stormy nature of her marriage in order to cast her in the role of victim.  What isn't opinion is the way the film treats her career: it didn't happen like that, and while the film presents her as a great star at the time of her death in truth she had released only a handful of widely distributed records by 1963--and while some of them were big hits, they weren't quite as big as you might think.  Even the celebrated &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; never made it to the top spot on any music chart, and it was not until well after her death that she received full recognition for her remarkable work.So instead of truth, or even a good approximation of it, SWEET DREAMS gives us the legend, the folk tale of the rough-and-tumble girl with the big, emotional voice who came from no where, married an abusive husband, and leaped into stardom that was cut short by an untimely death.  And as legend, the film works very well.The weak point of the film is the script, which plays largely to a &quot;domestic drama&quot; aspect and tends to smooth out the characters in a &quot;santized for your protection&quot; sort of way.  The direction and cinematography are no great shakes either, and ultimately SWEET DREAMS looks very much like a made-for-television movie.  But the cast carries it off in fine style.  Jessica Lang looks no more like Patsy Cline than I do, and her lip-scynchs to Cline's work is rather hit-and-miss, but she gives a truly memorable performance; Ed Harris equals her in the role of husband Charlie, and together they create a synergy that has tremendous power.  The supporting cast is also quite good, with Ann Wedgeworth a standout in the role of Cline's mother Hilda.And then there is that soundtrack.  Even if you've heard all these songs a thousand times, they're still worth hearing again.  Patsy Cline was truly an amazing artist.  But the film does something odd with them: the bulk of the story is set during the 1950s, but there is not a 1950s-era Cline vocal to be heard in the entire film, everything is taken from her glory years at MCA between 1960 and 1963.  And very often it seemed to me that the original scoring of Cline's songs had been replaced with new arrangements.And that, ultimately, is rather typical of the film as a whole.  Just a little change here, just a little inaccuracy there, and while they all seem slight individually, they add up to a fairly significant distortion collectively.  The performances make it worth watching, and they bring it in at a solid four stars.  But if you're expecting anything more than the glossy legend of Patsy Cline, you won't find it here.--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--",4,Great Performances Make The Film Work,1063756800,"09 17, 2003",2003,3330,"['Reality', 'generally', 'more', 'complicated', 'motion', 'picture', 'can', 'possibly', 'convey', 'such', 'case', 'SWEET', 'DREAMS', '1985', 'bio-pic', 'singer', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'ran', 'firestorm', 'criticism', 'time', 'release', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'was', 'not', 'figure', 'remote', 'past', 'life', 'were', 'extremely', 'well', 'recalled', 'family', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'one', 'attacked', 'film', 'extremely', 'inaccurate', 'portrait', 'her', 'husband', 'Charlie', 'life', 'career.To', 'certain', 'extent', 'validity', 'complaints', 'film', 'are', 'matter', 'opinion', 'seem', 'likely', 'script', 'softened', 'Cline', 'harder', 'edges', 'over-emphasized', 'stormy', 'nature', 'marriage', 'order', 'cast', 'role', 'victim', 'What', ""n't"", 'opinion', 'way', 'film', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'film', 'great', 'star', 'time', 'death', 'truth', 'had', 'released', 'only', 'handful', 'widely', 'distributed', 'records', '1963', 'were', 'big', 'hits', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'big', 'might', 'think', 'Even', 'celebrated', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'never', 'made', 'top', 'spot', 'music', 'chart', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'death', 'received', 'full', 'recognition', 'remarkable', 'work.So', 'instead', 'truth', 'even', 'good', 'approximation', 'SWEET', 'DREAMS', 'legend', 'folk', 'tale', 'rough-and-tumble', 'girl', 'big', 'emotional', 'voice', 'who', 'came', 'where', 'married', 'abusive', 'husband', 'leaped', 'stardom', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'untimely', 'death', 'legend', 'film', 'very', 'well.The', 'weak', 'point', 'film', 'script', 'largely', 'quot', 'domestic', 'drama', 'quot', 'aspect', 'smooth', 'out', 'characters', 'quot', 'santized', 'protection', 'quot', 'sort', 'way', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'are', 'great', 'shakes', 'ultimately', 'SWEET', 'DREAMS', 'very', 'much', 'made-for-television', 'movie', 'cast', 'off', 'fine', 'style', 'Jessica', 'Lang', 'more', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'do', 'lip-scynchs', 'Cline', 'work', 'rather', 'hit-and-miss', 'truly', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'role', 'husband', 'Charlie', 'together', 'create', 'synergy', 'tremendous', 'power', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Ann', 'Wedgeworth', 'standout', 'role', 'Cline', 'mother', 'Hilda.And', 'then', 'soundtrack', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'songs', 'thousand', 'times', ""'re"", 'still', 'worth', 'hearing', 'again', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'artist', 'film', 'something', 'odd', 'bulk', 'story', 'set', '1950s', 'not', '1950s-era', 'Cline', 'vocal', 'be', 'heard', 'entire', 'film', 'everything', 'taken', 'glory', 'years', 'MCA', '1960', '1963', 'very', 'often', 'seemed', 'original', 'scoring', 'Cline', 'songs', 'had', 'been', 'replaced', 'new', 'arrangements.And', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'typical', 'film', 'whole', 'Just', 'little', 'change', 'here', 'just', 'little', 'inaccuracy', 'there', 'seem', 'slight', 'individually', 'add', 'up', 'fairly', 'significant', 'distortion', 'collectively', 'performances', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'bring', 'solid', 'four', 'stars', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'more', 'glossy', 'legend', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'GFT', 'Amazon.com', 'Reviewer']",Sweet Dreams

Ask anyone who knew Patsy Cline or read Ellis Nassour's 1993 bestseller, ""Honky Tonk Angel: The Intimate Story of Patsy Cline"" and you'll see a much more beloved, complex Patsy Cline than what director Karel Reisz offers here. Filmed in 1985 in Virginia and Nashville, the main focus of the film is on Cline's second marriage to the love of her life, Charlie Dick, the father of her beloved children. It begins with their meeting and takes you on a short journey of how her career mixed with their marriage. All in all, the film, based on the extensive research I've done, is probably 40% accurate and her family and friends seem all but supportive of the film's story. Instead of showing the triumphant side of Cline - the woman who fought from an early age to leave her humble beginnings and realize her dream as a singer (and would become one of the best voices of all time) - it focuses on all of the tragedy of her life. But you know, trash sells. ""Sweet Dreams"" wasn't the box office smash it could have been. Jessica Lange's performance was well deserving of the Academy Award nomination that she recieved (she claims that the role of Patsy Cline was her favorite ever), although NOBODY could imitate someone as gifted and complex as Patsy Cline.

John Goodman has a small role in the film as Charley Dick's good ol' boy, meat head friend.The movie shows how this poorly educated, young woman with a throaty and achingly rich voice went on to become one of the greatest crossover talents ever to come out of Nashville.

Deciding it would make a great addition to my movie collection I bought it on Amazon. While purchasing it I noticed and decided to also buy Sweet Dreams which I saw is the story of Patsy Cline.  Patsy Cline had a small part in the Coal Miners Daughter and Loretta even went on to name one of her twins after Patsy.  They seemed to be close friends.  I love Patsy Cline!While watching Sweet Dreams I could only hope that half of it was Hollywooded up.  Not to take away from Patsy's incredible talent and voice I just had no idea she had lived such a wild and crazy life; leaving what looked to be a husband that would have let her do anything to marry an abusive, cocky man which I held no good feelings for through the entire movie.  Anyway, knowing her tragic end, in the scene where she is telling her Mom she doesn't know what to do with her life I could only think that her life was about to be over so she never really had to figure it all out.  The movie is well acted but certainly took away the rose colored picture I had in my mind of the legend that is Patsy Cline.  I think I may try to find a biography on her to see how acurate this movie portrayed her and her life.  It left me wanting to know what happened to her children.  I don't really care what happened to Charlie but I do wonder about her first husband.There is a lot of swearing (the GD word) and I wonder if she was really like that.

Maybe it was the 80's when women women were just starting to come out of the victim mentality that bothered me so much.  Sure Patsy had her ups and downs with her second husband Charlie Dick, but if he was as horrible in real life as he was portrayed in the movie, then a woman strong enough to make it as a singer, surely would have thrown his sorry self out early on.  From what I read in the book, Patsy was more than able to handle herself, and was quite coarse herself.On film, she's a sweet victim with an amazing voice.  Hardly what her friends said.  Patsy actually balked against doing a pop song like Walking After Midnight.  She said she felt like a prostitute doing pop. All she wanted to do was country, which she did at first. The film only concentrated on the pop hits she sang, not the country songs she loved so much.Jessica Lange did an outstanding job of portraying Patsy, though she's far too attractive than Patsy ever was.  But it was the lip-syncing that was really irritating.  I know it's not easy to do, but Jessica Lange isn't even a singer, so she always looked like she was faking it to me.Ed Harris as Charlie Dick was also outstanding.  He radiates charm and likeablity, and onscreen, he and Lange look like a real couple in love, yet unable to get along because of their insecurities.  They both get it right as a couple, allowing the audience to believe that they just can't keep away from each other.In the end of the film(I'm sure everyone knows the story of how Patsy died by now) the plane crashes into a mountain creating a fireball that destroys everything.  In actuality, the pilot(rumored to be having an affair with Patsy) didn't listen and took the plane up in bad weather.  Since he was not instrument trained, he got turned upside down and excelerated  into the ground.  Bodies were found, and people were stealing pieces of the plane and the passengers things right afterwards.  Putting this in the movie would have made a more poignant ending.The movie works because of Patsy's music, and the excellent acting and chemistry of Jessica Lange and Ed Harris.

I can't believe people actually think Beverly D'Angelo was a better Patsy Cline in Coal Miner's Daughter.  She didn't even come close. I also am glad that Lange did not use her own voice, but on perhaps a few hidden tracks in film. This is because this film has converted many into liking Patsy Cline because all her original vocals are on here. People who can't stand Country Music have drawn to her music through this medium. So I have to say all in all its a good film.",4,Jessica Lange is Patsy Cline !,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,876,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Crazy', 'way', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'portayed', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'angel', 'real', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'devil', 'portrayed', 'flick', 'think', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'outstanding', 'job', 'Patsy', 'best', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'play', 'spirit', 'spunk', 'Patsy', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'good', 'job', 'Charlie', 'Dick', 'Patsy', 'less', 'cordial', 'husband', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'actually', 'think', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'was', 'better', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'also', 'am', 'glad', 'Lange', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'own', 'voice', 'perhaps', 'few', 'hidden', 'tracks', 'film', 'film', 'converted', 'many', 'liking', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'original', 'vocals', 'are', 'here', 'People', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Country', 'Music', 'have', 'drawn', 'music', 'medium', 'So', 'have', 'say', 'good', 'film']",Sweet Dreams
43617,A36RM2S7UD5K2R,0783114907,"R. Whitney ""Ross Whitney""","[1, 1]","Sweet Dreams is a dream of a movie. Jessica Lange radiates in this film, as she does in most of her films, the exuberant and vibrant joy of a child on the night before Christmas. And the emotion always seems completely genuine, as if it comes from the actress as a person rather than from an actress in a role. Lange's chemistry with Ed Harris and Ann Wedgeworth, who plays Cline's mother, is fine indeed, and among the three of them passes an abundance of truly amusing (and often raunchy) on-screen humor. Lange lip-syncs all of the songs masterfully. You can see that her heart was in every note. You can't ever tell that she's lip syncing.The production design in this film is marvelous. The downright grubbiness of the various environments Cline inhabited is extraordinarily convincing. There is not a single scene in the entire movie that looks like a stage set.Karel Reisz was a director of great sensitivity. His films seem to leap off the screen into real life. If you're old enough to remember when Patsy Cline's voice papered the air waves, by all means see this. And if you're not, after you watch Sweet Dreams you may wish that you were. Cline was a musician of emotional power.John Goodman, in this early film role for him, is charmingly funny, and in fact everyone in the film seems perfectly cast. This one's a winner. This one's worth your nickel.",5,A dream of a movie,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,1364,"['Sweet', 'Dreams', 'dream', 'movie', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'film', 'most', 'films', 'exuberant', 'vibrant', 'joy', 'child', 'night', 'Christmas', 'emotion', 'always', 'completely', 'genuine', 'actress', 'person', 'rather', 'actress', 'role', 'Lange', 'chemistry', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Ann', 'Wedgeworth', 'who', 'Cline', 'mother', 'fine', 'indeed', 'three', 'abundance', 'truly', 'amusing', 'often', 'raunchy', 'on-screen', 'humor', 'Lange', 'lip-syncs', 'songs', 'masterfully', 'can', 'see', 'heart', 'was', 'note', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'tell', 'lip', 'syncing.The', 'production', 'design', 'film', 'marvelous', 'downright', 'grubbiness', 'various', 'environments', 'Cline', 'inhabited', 'extraordinarily', 'convincing', 'not', 'single', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'stage', 'set.Karel', 'Reisz', 'was', 'director', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'films', 'seem', 'leap', 'off', 'screen', 'real', 'life', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'voice', 'papered', 'air', 'waves', 'means', 'see', ""'re"", 'not', 'watch', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'may', 'wish', 'were', 'Cline', 'was', 'musician', 'emotional', 'power.John', 'Goodman', 'early', 'film', 'role', 'charmingly', 'funny', 'fact', 'everyone', 'film', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'one', 'winner', 'one', 'worth', 'nickel']",Sweet Dreams

Anyway, perhaps i was too young to be interested in the storyline when it was first shown in cinemas in 1985.Sweet Dreams is the story of Patsy Cline, or should I say about her relationship with husband (Ed Harris) which dominates most of the film.  Many have questioned the authenticity of the relationship displayed in the film, claiming it to be one-sided.  Who knows for sure.  What I can tell you is that Jessica Lange is outstanding in her role (although I did miss her blonde hair).Jessica lip-synchs during the singing scenes, and does this quite well (except for the odd occassion).SWEET DREAMS is a very watchable movie that is better than I expected.  I thought the reason I hadn't heard of it before was because it might have been a bad film.DVD SUMMARY:  My summary of the DVD is based on the Australian release.  While it should gets 5 stars for its anamorphic widescreen transfer, the transfer is not sharp, often quite bland.  However, near the end of the film the transfer starts to get sharper.  No extras at all on the DVD, not even a trailer.  Also noted is that the chapter selection does not work.  Aside from these issues, the DVD is worth owning or seeing for Jessica Lange's fine performance alone.",4,"Sweet Dreams, not so sweet DVD",1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,1311,"['Why', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'heard', 'film', 'now', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Anyway', 'perhaps', 'i', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'interested', 'storyline', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'cinemas', '1985.Sweet', 'Dreams', 'story', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'should', 'say', 'relationship', 'husband', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'most', 'film', 'Many', 'have', 'questioned', 'authenticity', 'relationship', 'displayed', 'film', 'claiming', 'be', 'one-sided', 'Who', 'sure', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'outstanding', 'role', 'did', 'miss', 'blonde', 'hair', 'lip-synchs', 'singing', 'scenes', 'quite', 'well', 'odd', 'occassion', '.SWEET', 'DREAMS', 'very', 'watchable', 'movie', 'better', 'expected', 'thought', 'reason', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'was', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'film.DVD', 'SUMMARY', 'summary', 'DVD', 'based', 'Australian', 'release', 'should', '5', 'stars', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'transfer', 'not', 'sharp', 'often', 'quite', 'bland', 'However', 'end', 'film', 'transfer', 'get', 'sharper', 'extras', 'DVD', 'not', 'even', 'trailer', 'Also', 'noted', 'chapter', 'selection', 'not', 'work', 'Aside', 'issues', 'DVD', 'worth', 'owning', 'seeing', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'fine', 'performance', 'alone']",Sweet Dreams
