""Burma VJ"" is essential viewing for anyone concerned about grassroots peacemaking, powerful new-media tools and the awe-inspiring courage that religious convictions can fuel in ordinary men and women. We've all seen far too much TV footage of homicidal suicide bombers--religious fervor fueling the destruction of innocent lives. In ""Burma VJ,"" we see ordinary men and women courageously risking and sometimes sacrificing their own lives on behalf of peace.One wonders: Why do these people do it? Their chance of peacefully toppling the ruthless military government of Burma/Myanmar is slim. In fact, as you know before you even watch this film, the protesters did not succeed in the 2007 movement. So, why even atempt this challenge? The question is answered by one of the young filmmakers in ""Burma VJ"" who dares to shoot footage of Buddhist monks attacked by thugs from the military dictatorship. Why do these monks inspire this young man? He answers: ""They are acting out of their knowledge of history. They are not acting out of anger.""Stunning. Their faith is unshakeable in its assumption that goodness will prevail. If not 20 years ago in the last major protests, if not in the 2007 protests--then in the next wave they are organizing secretly even as you read this review. And we're not talking about mere risks. Toward the end of the film, your heart will break in a scene that was carried by news networks around the world: a beaten monk's body drifting away in a river. After decades of severe repression, poverty and the constant threat of random arrest, torture, imprisonment and even death--for the people of Burma to peacefully protest against their military government takes incredible courage. We learn that two decades ago, the last time large-scale protests were launched, the effort ended when 3,000 innocents were gunned down in the streets. You'll learn about what happened to the 2007 protests in this film.For a talented young man or young woman to take a small video camera and become an illegal Video Journalist, a ""VJ,"" takes almost a crazy kind of faith and courage. For these young people to film police brutality against monks, for example, could be a ticket to torture and death. But, inspired by their Buddhist practice, dozens of VJs captured shocking scenes during street protests in 2007.You may be asking: Why not just turn away? Can such a documentary accomplish any good? Over and over again in this film, the young journalists of Burma voice the one question that haunts their sleepless nights: Will anyone care? If we risk our lives to smuggle this footage out of Burma, will anyone watch? Fortunately, the VJs found a valuable friend in Scandinavian filmmaker Anders stergaard, who finally pulled this documentary together for them. And, if you watch their film--and spread the word--then they've found a friend in you, too.",5,"Young Filmmakers Risk Their Lives for Peaceful Change in ""Burma VJ""",1277251200,"06 23, 2010",2010,3028,"['journalist', 'who', 'reported', 'Asia', 'life-and-death', 'pressures', 'Burma', 'Myanmar', 'highly', 'recommending', 'new-to-DVD', 'documentary', 'Burma', 'VJ', 'essential', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'concerned', 'grassroots', 'peacemaking', 'powerful', 'new-media', 'tools', 'awe-inspiring', 'courage', 'religious', 'convictions', 'can', 'fuel', 'ordinary', 'men', 'women', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'TV', 'footage', 'homicidal', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'religious', 'fervor', 'fueling', 'destruction', 'innocent', 'lives', 'Burma', 'VJ', 'see', 'ordinary', 'men', 'women', 'courageously', 'risking', 'sometimes', 'sacrificing', 'own', 'lives', 'behalf', 'peace.One', 'wonders', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'do', 'chance', 'peacefully', 'toppling', 'ruthless', 'military', 'government', 'Burma/Myanmar', 'slim', 'fact', 'know', 'even', 'watch', 'film', 'protesters', 'did', 'not', 'succeed', '2007', 'movement', 'So', 'why', 'even', 'atempt', 'challenge', 'question', 'answered', 'one', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'Burma', 'VJ', 'who', 'shoot', 'footage', 'Buddhist', 'monks', 'attacked', 'thugs', 'military', 'dictatorship', 'Why', 'do', 'monks', 'inspire', 'young', 'man', 'are', 'acting', 'knowledge', 'history', 'are', 'not', 'acting', 'anger.', 'Stunning', 'faith', 'unshakeable', 'assumption', 'goodness', 'will', 'prevail', 'not', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'last', 'major', 'protests', 'not', '2007', 'protests', 'then', 'next', 'wave', 'are', 'organizing', 'secretly', 'even', 'read', 'review', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'mere', 'risks', 'end', 'film', 'heart', 'will', 'break', 'scene', 'was', 'carried', 'news', 'networks', 'world', 'beaten', 'monk', 'body', 'drifting', 'away', 'river', 'decades', 'severe', 'repression', 'poverty', 'constant', 'threat', 'random', 'arrest', 'torture', 'imprisonment', 'even', 'death', 'people', 'Burma', 'peacefully', 'protest', 'military', 'government', 'incredible', 'courage', 'learn', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'last', 'time', 'large-scale', 'protests', 'were', 'launched', 'effort', 'ended', 'when', '3,000', 'innocents', 'were', 'gunned', 'down', 'streets', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'what', 'happened', '2007', 'protests', 'film.For', 'talented', 'young', 'man', 'young', 'woman', 'take', 'small', 'video', 'camera', 'become', 'illegal', 'Video', 'Journalist', 'VJ', 'almost', 'crazy', 'kind', 'faith', 'courage', 'young', 'people', 'film', 'police', 'brutality', 'monks', 'example', 'could', 'be', 'ticket', 'torture', 'death', 'inspired', 'Buddhist', 'practice', 'dozens', 'VJs', 'captured', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'street', 'protests', '2007.You', 'may', 'be', 'asking', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'turn', 'away', 'Can', 'such', 'documentary', 'accomplish', 'good', 'over', 'again', 'film', 'young', 'journalists', 'Burma', 'voice', 'one', 'question', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'Will', 'anyone', 'care', 'risk', 'lives', 'smuggle', 'footage', 'Burma', 'will', 'anyone', 'watch', 'Fortunately', 'VJs', 'found', 'valuable', 'friend', 'Scandinavian', 'filmmaker', 'Anders', 'stergaard', 'who', 'finally', 'pulled', 'documentary', 'together', 'watch', 'film', 'spread', 'word', 'then', ""'ve"", 'found', 'friend', 'too']",Burma VJ: Reporting from a Closed Country
1260922,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B002BWP3WU,Enjolras,"[17, 18]","I had the chance to see this movie when it went on tour and stopped in my city. I loved it. It is an extremely well-made documentary, but, oddly enough, seems more like an dramatic movie than a documentary. It follows several undercover journalists in the military dictatorship of Burma. The film follows them as they document the anti-government protests that took place in 2007 (also known as the ""Saffron Revolution""). The film keeps a quick pace and I actually found it quite suspenseful, even though the events took place over two years ago. The viewer is never sure whether the journalists will successfully evade arrest or even survive their next encounter. For those viewers not as familiar with the events of the Saffron Revolution, I expect the film will be all the more exciting.On another note, the footage in the film is incredible. The journalists used primarily handheld Sony videocameras, often hidden in bags in order to evade military spies. Yet, they filmed some incredible moments. Much of their documentation was fed to the international media and made headlines in September 2007. However, Burma VJ shows uncut versions of those scenes. Some of the images, such as the massive crowds cheering on the monks as they sang Robin Hood-esque songs, brought tears to my eyes. What those journalists did was incredibly brave, and unfortunately some of them lost their freedom in their attempt to tell the truth about Burma. This film is a wonderful testament to their courage.If you're not as familiar with Burma, you might want to check outBeyond Rangoon, a historical fiction about the 1988 protests, for some background before you go.If Burma VJ is playing in a theater near you, definitely check it out. Hopefully it will show in a general release or be issued on DVD soon.",5,A gripping documentary about the challenges of reporting from Burma,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,1791,"['had', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'went', 'tour', 'stopped', 'city', 'loved', 'extremely', 'well-made', 'documentary', 'oddly', 'enough', 'more', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'documentary', 'several', 'undercover', 'journalists', 'military', 'dictatorship', 'Burma', 'film', 'document', 'anti-government', 'protests', 'took', 'place', '2007', 'also', 'known', 'Saffron', 'Revolution', 'film', 'quick', 'pace', 'actually', 'found', 'quite', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'viewer', 'never', 'sure', 'journalists', 'will', 'successfully', 'evade', 'arrest', 'even', 'survive', 'next', 'encounter', 'viewers', 'not', 'familiar', 'events', 'Saffron', 'Revolution', 'expect', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'exciting.On', 'note', 'footage', 'film', 'incredible', 'journalists', 'used', 'primarily', 'handheld', 'Sony', 'videocameras', 'often', 'hidden', 'bags', 'order', 'evade', 'military', 'spies', 'filmed', 'incredible', 'moments', 'Much', 'documentation', 'was', 'fed', 'international', 'media', 'made', 'headlines', 'September', '2007', 'However', 'Burma', 'VJ', 'uncut', 'versions', 'scenes', 'images', 'such', 'massive', 'crowds', 'cheering', 'monks', 'sang', 'Robin', 'Hood-esque', 'songs', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'What', 'journalists', 'did', 'was', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'unfortunately', 'lost', 'freedom', 'attempt', 'tell', 'truth', 'Burma', 'film', 'wonderful', 'testament', 'courage.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Burma', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'outBeyond', 'Rangoon', 'historical', 'fiction', '1988', 'protests', 'background', 'go.If', 'Burma', 'VJ', 'playing', 'theater', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'show', 'general', 'release', 'be', 'issued', 'DVD', 'soon']",Burma VJ: Reporting from a Closed Country

While 100,000 people (including Buddhist monks and students) took to the streets to protest the country's repressive regime that held the country hostage for over 40 years, foreign news crews were banned to enter the country and the Internet was shut down. The Democratic Voice of Burma, a collective of underground video journalists (VJs) recorded these dramatic events on handycams and smuggled the footage out of the country, broadcasting worldwide the peaceful protests, arrests, and the corpse of a monk floating in a Rangoon creek.

I've read the other reviews, and am compelled to add my 5-stars. Aside from the courageous efforts of the filmmakers to bring attention to the miserable situation in Burma, the question remains regarding why the UN has done nothing to address the situation. To me, the unspeakable cruelty of the military regime in Burma is unconscionable, and I don't think enough can be said about the arrogance of that regime. We don't need another war; rather, enlightenment regarding world opinion of the atrocities. This is not a religious conflict, as displayed by the lack of concern to quiet the monks and nuns who went all out in behalf of the populace's well-being. The selfish and mindless acts of brutality and mayhem mean nothing to the military rather than control of a nation dying. Highly recommended, encouraged for all to see.
