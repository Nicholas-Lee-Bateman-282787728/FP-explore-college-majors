However if one is to compare one version from another in the attempt to settle on a ""best"", then I would have to cast my lot in with the 1980 version.  I am passionate for duologue; and  Austin is suburb on that front.  This version is like watching the book come to life; and nothing pleases me more, than when a movie does that.

How some people can hail this as the best adaptation ever, especially considering the 1995 series, is well beyond me. The best that can be said about this movie is that it keeps close to the novel and that its extensive length allows the luxury of but a few omissions. But the production is drab and the direction is dull.The cast is at best questionable. Elizabeth Garvie is a cute and rather delightful Lizzy, although she tends to downplay the character too much. Still, she is way superior to this dull stick David Rintoul. He looks like an orangutan, he moves like one, and he sounds like a robot. If there ever was a more wooden, artificial and just plain tedious Darcy, I have yet to meet him. He is the greatest disappointment in a production of spectacular mediocrity.Mrs Bennet's portrayal is rather accomplished though by no means exceptional. But Mr Bennet is completely devoid of his exquisite sense of humour, and he comes off as a stuffy old bore who is all but insufferably boring. None of the rest disgraces him- or herself. None makes any special impression either. I have some sneaky admiration for Mr Collins and Mr Wickham, but that's just about all. Almost the whole cast seems to have been sedated before shooting.In short, a decent attempt and I can well see why it was reportedly very popular during the 1980s. But it has aged badly, partly due to inherent shortcomings, partly - perhaps mostly - due to the devastating influence of the highly superior 1995 version.",3,Devastatingly superseded by the 1995 remake,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,1527,"['1980', 'version', 'baffles', 'end', 'How', 'people', 'can', 'hail', 'best', 'adaptation', 'ever', 'especially', 'considering', '1995', 'series', 'well', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'close', 'novel', 'extensive', 'length', 'luxury', 'few', 'omissions', 'production', 'drab', 'direction', 'dull.The', 'cast', 'best', 'questionable', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'cute', 'rather', 'delightful', 'Lizzy', 'downplay', 'character', 'too', 'much', 'Still', 'way', 'superior', 'dull', 'stick', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'orangutan', 'one', 'robot', 'ever', 'was', 'more', 'wooden', 'artificial', 'just', 'plain', 'tedious', 'Darcy', 'have', 'yet', 'meet', 'greatest', 'disappointment', 'production', 'spectacular', 'mediocrity.Mrs', 'Bennet', 'portrayal', 'rather', 'accomplished', 'means', 'exceptional', 'Mr', 'Bennet', 'completely', 'devoid', 'exquisite', 'sense', 'humour', 'off', 'stuffy', 'old', 'bore', 'who', 'insufferably', 'boring', 'None', 'rest', 'him-', 'None', 'special', 'impression', 'have', 'sneaky', 'admiration', 'Mr', 'Collins', 'Mr', 'Wickham', 'just', 'whole', 'cast', 'have', 'been', 'sedated', 'shooting.In', 'short', 'decent', 'attempt', 'can', 'well', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'reportedly', 'very', 'popular', '1980s', 'aged', 'badly', 'partly', 'due', 'inherent', 'shortcomings', 'partly', 'perhaps', 'mostly', 'due', 'devastating', 'influence', 'highly', 'superior', '1995', 'version']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

228699,AH93HX89KVQG2,6300248569,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[837, 861]","I've lost count of how many times I've read Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - it's one of my very favorite books. Comparing the two miniseries adaptations of it -- this one done in the 80s by BBC and the more recent one by A&E;/BBC (Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)) -- there are definite advantages to each. The one you choose depends on what you want. If you want a Hollywood-style romantic comedy, watch the A&E; version. But if you want what is closest to Austen's novel (which I prefer, and enjoyed more), watch the older BBC version. The first time I tried to watch the newer version, I turned it off after the first 30 minutes because I kept saying, ""THAT didn't happen in the book"" over and over again and it was really frustrating me. I finally forced myself to keep watching it with my mom there to be able to vent to as needed (she's also a huge fan of P&P; and of the Rintoul version), and got through it OK and then wrote this review afterwards.POSITIVES OF THE A&E; VERSION:1) It is a visual feast: The costumes, sets and scenery are exquisite and make that version worth watching for that reason alone. They obviously had a larger budget than the 80s version, which is done in the old BBC 'stage play' style.2) Since that version is 75 minutes longer than the BBC version, you get to enjoy that much more of Austen's incomparable dialogue - the best ever written in the English language besides Shakespeare, in my opinion!3) In the interplays between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, their emotions are much more pronounced and open than in the BBC version... which makes their relationship more openly romantic even than in the novel. This is developed further by some scenes of them individually that weren't in the novel. In the 80s version and the novel, many of the subtleties of their relationship and feelings are left to the imagination. The A&E; version is more in the unsubtle style of a typical modern romantic movie, which gives a wonderful new dimension to the story. The ""unexpected proposal"" scene is absolutely perfect; I think Austen would have loved it!4) Casting Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Although not as strikingly handsome as David Rintoul's Darcy in the 80s version (in the book, Darcy is far handsomer than Bingley), Firth adds more visible emotion to the character which David R. did not, while also maintaining a very aristocratic, refined air about him.POSITIVES OF THIS 80s BBC VERSION:1) It is much more faithful to the historical setting of the novel. It captures much more accurately the slow-moving, thoughtful, refined, restrained, purist, obsessed-with-manners (but still quite amusing) aristocratic society of 18th century England. This to me gives not only a needed believability to, but also a much deeper understanding of, the characters and story. Austen's novels were very realistic and true to their time and place, so if you want the genuine Austen feel rather than the 'in-your-face' Hollywood style, see the 80s version (or just stick to the book). The A&E; version comes across as being 20th century American, just cloaked in 18th century England costumes and sets. Some people have praised this aspect of it, saying that the 80s version is boring by comparison. But I believe that Austen's intent was that the interest in her novels would lie with her detailed character studies and intricate relational plots. That's what made her books so interesting, without all the action-packed gallivanting around and crassness which Hollywood seems to think is a necessity to entertainment. The 80s version recognizes this and retains a historical elegance and dignity; the A&E; version does not. (In the A&E; version, Bingley's two supposedly high class sisters slouch around, make faces and giggle audibly behind people's backs. Everyone seems to be constantly running, skipping or galloping somewhere. The less-than-savory characters, like Mary, Lydia, Kitty, and Mr. Wickham, look and act like they are from a much lower social class, in ways that go below what would have been acceptable in their class. A visitor to the Bennett home accidentally sees one of the sisters in her undergarments. When Elizabeth visits Pemberley, she sees Mr. Darcy coming from a dip in a pond with a wet undershirt on, rather than just having arrived in a carriage as in the book.)2) The casting is better in the BBC version and each actor is completely natural and believable in his or her role. In the A&E; version, much of the casting does not seem to fit the characters: Elizabeth comes across as being about twenty years older than she is (with a constantly knowing look as if she's already married with children), Mrs. Bennett seems too intelligent to be so silly, Charlotte seems snobby rather than humble, Miss Bingley seems cold and sharp rather than sweetly slimy, and Mr. Collins is like a cartoon and not a believable person. The actors seemed quite competent, just not cast in the right roles, and maybe directed to overplay them. The only exception, as I mentioned above, is Colin Firth as Darcy.3) The 80s BBC version gives the same attention to each character that Austen's novel does. In the A&E; version, only the principal characters are focused on, with the result that many of the characters who we should have gotten to know better seemed to just be cardboard props, and their relationships with each other don't come across as being as intimate and familiar as they really are in the novel. For example, Elizabeth had a much deeper relationship with her father, her friend Charlotte and her Aunt Gardiner than the A&E; version portrayed, because it left out some key scenes between those characters. The only ones I could perceive as being really close in the A&E; version were Elizabeth and Jane - and in the last half, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. This is a great loss, because Austen's novels are not just about romance, but about the relationships between people, and each of their interesting personality quirks. They are character studies -- not just of the main characters, but of ALL the characters.BUT AS ALWAYS, it's a good idea to 1) read the negative reviews as well as the positive, since they are wildly different from each other, and 2) RENT before you buy!",5,Which adaptation is better?

228700,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,6300248569,anna-joelle,"[299, 325]","I have watched the newer A&E; adaptation of ""Pride & Prejudice"" (starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth) a couple of years ago, and enjoyed it very much. Last week, I borrowed from the local British Council Library, the video of this much earlier (1980) adaptation of Austen's novel. And my verdict? I find this earlier production to be MUCH, MUCH superior to A&E;'s!!The casting is perfect, principally Elizabeth Garvie (an Elizabeth playing ""Elizabeth Bennett"", how very nice!), David Rintoul (as Mr Darcy) and the actors playing Mr & Mrs Bennett (brilliant performance from both), Mr Collins, Charlotte Lucas and oh, just about EACH and EVERY character! I must give my opinion that I find the Mr Darcy here far handsomer than that portrayed by Colin Firth. David Rintoul's Darcy is classically handsome - tall, dark, brooding, with nicely chiselled features and a very noble bearing. I loved to hear him speak. Elizabeth here is reasonably pretty too, has a ready wit and also displays great sensibility and generosity (I thought Jennifer Ehle was a little chubby for her character). The Mr Collins in this earlier production is also truer to the book; he is still odious, self-centred and annoying to the last degree, but is less of a caricature than that portrayed in A&E;'s version.But I enjoyed this production best of all for the following 3 reasons:1) I like it that some of Elizabeth's most important thoughts are made known to the viewer through a voice-over. For instance, after rejecting Darcy's proposal, we find Elizabeth, not in tears like in the A&E;'s version, but thoughtful and a little dazed, and as she sits down to ""digest"" what has just happened, the voice-over lets us know what she is thinking. At the end of her thoughts, when she smiles and concludes that she finds Darcy's proposal, ""gratifying"", I find it plausible. Who in Elizabeth's position wouldn't find Darcy's proposal flattering?2) Although made in 1980, this production does not look at all ""jaded"" or 1980s (unlike many earlier BBC dramas). The costumes are beautiful (with many costume changes for the main characters) and the make-up does not give the impression that this is an outdated production. The characters too do not look like they are wearing wigs. I only wish it will be made available on DVD soon with perhaps the colour and picture quality improved.3) The ending here is more pleasing and romantic than A&E;'s. The words uttered by our hero and heroine in the end are sweet and romantic and will stay in the viewer's mind for a long time.If you have enjoyed A&E;'s adaptation, then I urge you to pick up this earlier video and see for yourself why the latter is the better and more enjoyable production.

It is now worn out from repeated viewing, so I'm happy that the DVD is now available.Essentially, I think this version (vs. the Colin Firth A&E; version) adheres to the novel better and to the spirit of Jane Austen. While I enjoy that version and Mr. Firth, it includes scenes not in the novel,  has a more modern sensibility and is more overtly romantic (though not as romantic as the 2005 version).I believe Jane Austen's words are the real joy of this version. They come alive and absolutely sparkle in the hands of these actors! In addition, there are two characters that I believe are distinctly better in this version: Lady Catherine is delicious and infuriating, and Mr. Collins is a comic gem of a performance. The first proposal scene is I believe word for word from the novel and played to perfection. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as accessible to modern audiences as Colin Firth's, but I believe Rintoul's performance is more subtle and closer to Austen's intent.

Particularly well cast are Elizabeth (though Keira Knightly is still my favorite Elizabeth), Mrs. Bennet, Lydia, Aunt and Uncle Gardner, Mr. Collins, Charlotte, and Lady Catherine. (The only reason I do not include Darcy is that everyone has their own Mr. Darcy and in my opinion there are as many Mr. Darcys as there are readers and/or viewers!)Coming in at 265 minutes, this is a bit shorter than the Colin FirthPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)production. It has some scenes deleted or greatly minimalized and some of the characters are not well developed.  However, overall, it is well done.The central character in this version is definitely Elizabeth. Everything is shown from her exclusive viewpoint. It is not even easy to intuit the thinking and motivation of Darcy in particular, or other characters as well.If you can have only one version of a tv presentation of P&P;, I would say buy this one if you are more interested in seeing the Elizabeth as the guiding character but if you would like to see one where Darcy shares the spotlight, get the Colin Firth version.

Reactions are polarized.  Proponents of each side say their version has the best acting, the best actors, the best scenery, the best photography, etc. etc.  How can you make an informed choice?1995: The characters (actors) have a personal style, manner, carriage, tone of voice that is more today's people (even though they wear the costumes of the past).  They are livelier.  Their speech, though British, is today's British.  If this appeals to you, the 1980 version will appear slow, the characters stiff, their subtlety baffling or nonexistent.And this will be true, even if you've read the book.  Readers project onto the characters in a book the attitudes and style they prefer.1980: In this version, the actors try to behave, comport themselves and speak in a style and manner which they (or the director) believed people used in 1812.  Screenwriter Fay Weldon, who specializes in writing about the British upper class, fashioned a screenplay which attempts to capture this.  If you like to immerse yourself in the past, doing a little imaginative time-travel, this is the version you'll prefer.The 1995 version will seem to you completely unrealistic, the characters anachronistic, the lavish color wasted, the acting bad, etc.An indicator: If you know which version of The Forsyte Saga or The Secret Garden you prefer, you can make a good guess as to which Pride and Prejudice you'll like.  The 1996 Forsyte Saga versus the 1967 Forsyte Saga.  The 1995 Secret Garden versus the 1975 BBC Secret Garden.(You can no longer go by whether it's BBC.  In recent years, the BBC has changed.

You'll want to slaughter Fanny) can appreciate why most people enjoy P & P the most. Elizabeth was easily my favorite character because she is witty, has her faults, and is playful and fun. I didn't fall in love so much with Mr. Darcy who seemed a bit of a stick in the mud, but by the end of the book when they married I had plenty of warm, fuzzy feelings. Still, Mr. Darcy wasn't the most likable, so when I bought the more recent version and watched it, I was like WOW! 'Cuz not only do you like Mr. Darcy, you fall in love with him thanks to Collin Firth's superb acting. In the older version, however, David Rintoul played him a little too stiff and uppity. His portrayl is closer to that of Mr. Darcy than the dreadful Laurence Olivier version (Mr. Darcy is far too ""perky"" in that one). Still, even in the book, Mr. Darcy at least smiled every now and then; here he's as morose as a corpse. Jane in this version is prettier than Elizabeth as depicted in the book, which is better because I didn't find the Jane in the more modern version that pretty although I think the actress in the A&E version did a better job of portraying Jane's character. Comparing Elizabeth Garvie's performance and Jennifer Ehle's to determine a favorite is very tough. Garvie's performance is probably closer to the book as is the rest of the movie, but Jennifer Ehle's Lizzie is more playful, like Elizabeth is described as. I didn't really see Garvie as ""playful"", but she still did an excellent job. All in all, this version was just a whole lot more boring than the Firth/Ehle one. In that one I was hooked from beginning to end, but this one I found I just didn't really care one way or another. Mainly I just watched it to note the differences between both versions and the novel. This version is closer to the book, but all in all the version with Jennifer Ehle and Collin Firth is my favorite.

228720,A3K7A04ZGA8WQA,6300248569,coasteray,"[5, 5]","I really enjoy this 1979 production of Pride and Prejudice, finding that it still holds up very well compared to the Colin Firth version of 1995, which I also immensely enjoy; also when compared to the 2005 movie with Keira Knightley, which, again, I also very much enjoy.  They all have good things to offer in their own unique way.  I may as well toss in the 1940 version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.  It's definitely old MGM/Hollywood, but, hey, it's cool in its own way, too.  Well, onward with my thoughts on the 1979 BBC version.First, the production itself is purposely more simplistic and uncluttered in nature.  It's not a technical or artistic triumph by any means.  However, I found myself attracted to the simple nature of it all, perhaps in a strange way reflecting simpler times.  For example, you can hear the room ambience via the simple miking techniques. It sounds like you are right there in the room.  The audio is not produced to make each actor sound up close to you, therefore making it sound more like real life in a real room.  Well, this is just one example.  Overall, the film has the look and feel of a stage play, though it's not on a stage.  I will admit, though, that the photography often looks a bit soft, and there are some exposure problems.  In one scene (can't remember now where it is--somewhere in the second half?), it looks like the sun came out and then went back behind a cloud.  You can see the effect on a building.  Weird.All technical and artistic considerations aside (some of you may have to try hard to set these things aside), I found myself very much enjoying almost all of the the cast members and story presentation, which, I believe, are the real issues here.  I believe Elizabeth Garvie is wonderful in her role.  However, I would have preferred that David Rintoul's portrayal of Darcy not be so stiff.  If he had been less stiff, his relationship with Elizabeth would appear to be more real.  I'm sure he's a fine actor, so I must assume his portrayal of Darcy is the full intention of the producers of the film.  Though I haven't yet had the chance to read the book, I've heard that Darcy isn't this stiff in the book.I like Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Bennett (not as shrill as the 1995 version) and all the other sisters, especially Jane.  She's better than the other gal in the l995 version, whose facial features are kind of funny, almost slightly boyish.  The 1979 Jane is much better.  I also like Mr. Bingley in this '79 version, but I don't like Mr. Collins as well as the 1995 version.  He's too much like a buffoon here.  Lady Catherine is excellent here, however.There are some small details missing as compared to the 1995 version.  Certain scenes in the 1995 version are more fleshed out.  One thing I found likeable in the 1979 version, though, is when we can hear Lizzie's personal thoughts.  That nice touch really makes it sound intimate to the viewer.Well, we could spend lots of time comparing versions, and comparing all of them to the book.  There are too many details concerning the characters and story presentation to list them here.  Shall we also count the times the actors quote from the book compared to the 1995 version or the movies?  I'm not going there.I try to enjoy each movie and mini-series on its own merits.  In the end, it doesn't really matter, anyway.  Pick whichever one you like and just appreciate the others.  They all help us appreciate Jane Austen's writing.  The same can be said of the various movie and mini-series versions of Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, etc.I hope I've been able to persuade someone out there to check out this 1979 version of Pride and Prejudice and enjoy it.

228721,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,6300248569,CodeMaster Talon,"[5, 9]","With yet another impending adaptation of the what is probably the most delightful classic in literature, I thought it would be fun to review this made-for-TV ""Pride and Prejudice"" from 1980.Jane Austen junkie I that I am, I am embarressed to say I had never seen this old BBC version until just recently. As you can probably tell from the DVD cover and description, this version is not nearly as sumptuous as the recent A&E; adaptation, nor as glossy as the old Hollywood version, but it is fun, because the story is fun, and I would say worth buying for people who can't get enough of Austen's tale.As everyone knows ""Pride and Prejudice"" follows the romantic adventures of lively Elizabeth Bennet and her four sisters. In a time when being an old maid was a social and economic disaster with few modern day comparisons, Elizabeth Bennet is determined to marry where her heart takes her, but will her own prejudices lead her astray? We've all seen it a thousand times before, but for me it never gets old.The cast here is adequate if nothing too spectacular. Elizabeth Garvie makes a decent Lizzy, but doesn't quite have the sparkle Jennifer Ehle had in the 90's version. The weak point here is really David Rintoul as Darcy; his performance is unintentionally hilarious. When Lizzy says, ""I cannot forget his warmth"", we wonder what she's talking about. Certainly we never see anything but a person who appears to be from another planet, one where everyone speaks and stands so stiffly you could use them as furniture (I realize perfect posture is keeping with the period, but he goes a bit too far). The rest of the cast is okay. Sabina Franklyn as Jane at least manages to come off as genuinely kind and gentle, and Natalie Ogle as silly Lydia and Priscilla Morgan as Mrs. Bennet are both incredibly irritating, but then they're supposed to be.One thing I have never seen any version of ""P&P;"" get right is the physical characteristics of Mr. Wickham. In the novel, he is supposed to be very very good-looking, and indeed that is why he is perhaps believed over Darcy, who is more subtly handsome. Not even A&E; did that right, but the 2005 version looks like it will be the first to correct this mistake. In this old series we have a Wickham who seems to be 95% head.But this story has always been about the fun plot and the witty dialogue, and it's all intact here, thanks to the great Fay Weldon, who adapted it. I would say that although this ""P&P;"" is the weakest, visually, it's still worth buying for Austen fans or those who love period films and shows.But if for some reason you have never seen a ""Pride and Prejudice"" please don't start here, get the A&E; adaptation.  And of course, read the book first.GRADE: B",4,"""I have a mind amazed at its own discomposure.""",1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,2726,"['yet', 'impending', 'adaptation', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'delightful', 'classic', 'literature', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'review', 'made-for-TV', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '1980.Jane', 'Austen', 'junkie', 'am', 'am', 'embarressed', 'say', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'old', 'BBC', 'version', 'just', 'recently', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', 'DVD', 'cover', 'description', 'version', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'sumptuous', 'recent', 'A', 'E', 'adaptation', 'as', 'glossy', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'fun', 'story', 'fun', 'would', 'say', 'worth', 'buying', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Austen', 'tale.As', 'everyone', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'romantic', 'adventures', 'lively', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'four', 'sisters', 'time', 'when', 'being', 'old', 'maid', 'was', 'social', 'economic', 'disaster', 'few', 'modern', 'day', 'comparisons', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'determined', 'marry', 'where', 'heart', 'will', 'own', 'prejudices', 'lead', 'astray', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'never', 'old.The', 'cast', 'here', 'adequate', 'nothing', 'too', 'spectacular', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'decent', 'Lizzy', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'sparkle', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'had', '90', 'version', 'weak', 'point', 'here', 'really', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'Darcy', 'performance', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'When', 'Lizzy', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'warmth', 'wonder', 'what', 'talking', 'Certainly', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'person', 'who', 'be', 'planet', 'one', 'where', 'everyone', 'speaks', 'so', 'stiffly', 'could', 'use', 'furniture', 'realize', 'perfect', 'posture', 'keeping', 'period', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'rest', 'cast', 'okay', 'Sabina', 'Franklyn', 'Jane', 'least', 'manages', 'come', 'off', 'genuinely', 'kind', 'gentle', 'Natalie', 'Ogle', 'silly', 'Lydia', 'Priscilla', 'Morgan', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'are', 'incredibly', 'irritating', 'then', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be.One', 'thing', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'version', 'P', 'P', 'get', 'right', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'Mr.', 'Wickham', 'novel', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'good-looking', 'indeed', 'why', 'perhaps', 'believed', 'Darcy', 'who', 'more', 'subtly', 'handsome', 'Not', 'even', 'A', 'E', 'did', 'right', '2005', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'correct', 'mistake', 'old', 'series', 'have', 'Wickham', 'who', 'be', '95', '%', 'head.But', 'story', 'always', 'been', 'fun', 'plot', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'intact', 'here', 'thanks', 'great', 'Fay', 'Weldon', 'who', 'adapted', 'would', 'say', 'P', 'P', 'weakest', 'visually', 'still', 'worth', 'buying', 'Austen', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'period', 'films', 'shows.But', 'reason', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'here', 'get', 'A', 'E', 'adaptation', 'course', 'read', 'book', 'first.GRADE', 'B']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

228727,A2DRCJ1YOFTZKK,6300248569,Dana,"[11, 21]","In my opinion, there are only two adaptations of P&P; worth watching: this one and the 1995 miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. The other ones suffer from shortness. The essence of P&P; is not the love story; it is the portraying of a society and its manners and virtues, and you cannot do the book justice in a two hours movie. Thus, I will consider only these two versions in my review.The 1980 version is, in a way, truer to the book. It changes only some minor details and does not add anything that is not in the book - the 1995 version adds three scenes at least, with the intention of better explaining the character of Darcy to a modern audience.In fact, it has the air more of a theater play than of a movie, in the style of all BBC series of the time. Darcy is just as handsome and stiff as in the book, Lizzy just as witty. Many dialogues are exactly as in the book, and some narrative passages are included by way of characters meditating.But most of the other charaters just don't match. Mr. Bingley is very, very dull and in no way does justice to the book character, which was funny and engaging. Mr. Bennett was another big disappointment, he always seems so unhappy and serious, when in fact he is a man who assumes and accepts his own decisions and mistakes and tries to make the best of them. Wickham shows his true colors in his face and manner right from the beginning, he looks just the scoundrel he is, is is hard to imagine how a sensible girl like Lizzy did not see right through him. He, and especially Lydia, are not expanded well enough, thus their elopement comes out of thin air.The only exception were the Gardiners, who look just as in the book.Lady Catherine will come as a shock to those of you used to the 1995 version, because she is a very different person. Where the 1995 one was perpetually bored and in slow motion, and old, the 1980 one is younger, agile and sparkling. Both interpretations are equally valid, I guess, I cannot decide which one I like best.As to Darcy and Lizzy: I know Jane Austen never said that Lizzy was beautiful, just that she had very ""fine eyes"", but I always felt that she was the kind of person who more than made up for that by her wits and spirit. Lizzy was passionate, and in this movie she is not. (In the discussion with Lady Catherine, she doesn't lose her temper even once.) She acts very well rehearsed lines, but does not get into the character. Or perhaps she just isn't Lizzy as I have pictured it. She and Darcy have no chemistry at all. Chemistry might be a modern concept for the XIXth century, but still, you would like your hero and heroine to look like they belong together, and these two do not. That is even more true for Jane and Bingley, which look like they belong in different movies.My opinion may be biased because when I first watched this mini series, I had already watched the 1995 version at least 5 times, and to my mind, the characters, dialogues, places and events were well fixed. To me, it was like walking into a familiar house and finding all things just slightly out of place. I felt the impulse to go and put everything back like it was. I guess to any viewer, her favourite of the two will always remain the one she watched first.",3,"Lifeless, compared to the 1995 version",1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,3248,"['opinion', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'adaptations', 'P', 'P', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', '1995', 'miniseries', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'other', 'ones', 'suffer', 'shortness', 'essence', 'P', 'P', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'portraying', 'society', 'manners', 'virtues', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'Thus', 'will', 'consider', 'only', 'two', 'versions', 'review.The', '1980', 'version', 'way', 'truer', 'book', 'only', 'minor', 'details', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'not', 'book', '1995', 'version', 'three', 'scenes', 'least', 'intention', 'better', 'explaining', 'character', 'Darcy', 'modern', 'audience.In', 'fact', 'air', 'more', 'theater', 'play', 'movie', 'style', 'BBC', 'series', 'time', 'Darcy', 'just', 'handsome', 'stiff', 'book', 'Lizzy', 'just', 'witty', 'Many', 'dialogues', 'are', 'exactly', 'book', 'narrative', 'passages', 'are', 'included', 'way', 'characters', 'meditating.But', 'most', 'other', 'charaters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'very', 'very', 'dull', 'way', 'justice', 'book', 'character', 'was', 'funny', 'engaging', 'Mr.', 'Bennett', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'always', 'so', 'unhappy', 'serious', 'when', 'fact', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'decisions', 'mistakes', 'tries', 'make', 'best', 'Wickham', 'true', 'colors', 'face', 'manner', 'right', 'beginning', 'just', 'scoundrel', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'sensible', 'girl', 'Lizzy', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'right', 'especially', 'Lydia', 'are', 'not', 'expanded', 'well', 'enough', 'thus', 'elopement', 'thin', 'air.The', 'only', 'exception', 'were', 'Gardiners', 'who', 'look', 'just', 'book.Lady', 'Catherine', 'will', 'come', 'shock', 'used', '1995', 'version', 'very', 'different', 'person', 'Where', '1995', 'one', 'was', 'perpetually', 'bored', 'slow', 'motion', 'old', '1980', 'one', 'younger', 'agile', 'sparkling', 'interpretations', 'are', 'equally', 'valid', 'guess', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'one', 'like', 'best.As', 'Darcy', 'Lizzy', 'know', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'never', 'said', 'Lizzy', 'was', 'beautiful', 'just', 'had', 'very', 'fine', 'eyes', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'wits', 'spirit', 'Lizzy', 'was', 'passionate', 'movie', 'not', 'discussion', 'Lady', 'Catherine', ""n't"", 'lose', 'temper', 'even', 'once', 'very', 'well', 'rehearsed', 'lines', 'not', 'get', 'character', 'perhaps', 'just', ""n't"", 'Lizzy', 'have', 'pictured', 'Darcy', 'have', 'chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'might', 'be', 'modern', 'concept', 'XIXth', 'century', 'still', 'would', 'like', 'hero', 'heroine', 'look', 'belong', 'together', 'two', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'more', 'true', 'Jane', 'Bingley', 'look', 'belong', 'different', 'movies.My', 'opinion', 'may', 'be', 'biased', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'mini', 'series', 'had', 'already', 'watched', '1995', 'version', 'least', '5', 'times', 'mind', 'characters', 'dialogues', 'places', 'events', 'were', 'well', 'fixed', 'was', 'walking', 'familiar', 'house', 'finding', 'things', 'just', 'slightly', 'place', 'felt', 'impulse', 'go', 'put', 'everything', 'back', 'was', 'guess', 'viewer', 'favourite', 'two', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'one', 'watched', 'first']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

228729,A2G1GCHGVUG98K,6300248569,dee,"[13, 14]","A very nice rendition of the novel; the BBC does great work!  The sets are nothing to its 1995 successor, but the respective scores fit each.  Here, the music is very homey and ""small-ish"" to fit the image, and music for Collins is hilarious; in the 1995 version, the energetic score fits the opening scenes wonderfully.  Plus, this DVD beats the 1995 DVD on sound quality, hands down.Jane (Sabina Franklyn) is terrific and I prefer her Jane, although I like Harker's; it is puzzling, though, when she beats on Darcy for snubbing Lizzy when Jane is supposed to think well of everyone. Mrs. Bennet is less shrill than her '95 version. Interesting interpretation of Anne (she likes Lizzy).  Mrs. Gardiner is done *very* well.  Lady Catherine feels truly like a rude *noble*woman, like she was born into her title.  Judy Parfitt's performance is, for me, the best.Unfortunately, the major drawback of this version is that the other side characters are not as good, and many are just plot-movers; in '95 they're fuller characters.  Mary's too hurt about being snubbed.  Charlotte is oddly very happy about Collins and de Bourgh, rather than contentedly resigned.  Moray Watson's Mr. Bennet doesn't work and is probably furthest from the novel.  He's far too severe and looks mad all the time and thus makes the lines of ""sarcastic humor"" seem harsh.The Bingleys are all right here, but it's hard to top '95's catty (and orange) Chancellor and the adorably eager Bonham-Carter.  Col. Fitzwilliam here is too stiff and serious, although he looks the part; he just doesn't measure up to Calf's '95 Fitzwilliam, who is the guy to a T (except Calf is too good-looking).But it is a truth universally acknowledged that the success of a ""P&P;"" version rides on its Elizabeth and Darcy, and this is where this one succeeds.Elizabeth Garvie *is* Elizabeth physically--slight of figure, pretty, light brown hair.  The character, oddly, is a bit over eager; Darcy's criticism of Jane (""she smiles too much"") works for this Lizzy.  She smiles so much during the Hunsford proposal that when Darcy accuses her of incivility he comes across as oversensitive.She also seems to care too much what Darcy and the others think; in this version, her desire to go home when Jane's sick seems motivated by how upset she is because of her hosts' behavior rather than the novel's reason of not wishing to be an improper guest who overstays her welcome. She also seems to fall harder for Wickham than the novel indicates.Even so, Garvie captures Lizzy on other levels.  She's funny and impertinent, just like Lizzy is supposed to be.  Her teasing Bingley is beautifully done, as in the novel, and her line that marrying Mr. Darcy would no doubt scare Anne is hilariously delivered, as is her conversation with Charlotte about Collins' hat.IMHO, the main problem with this Lizzy is a little inconsistency, and it seems more the inconsistency in the lines than with Garvie.  Besides caring too much what others think, she gets over Darcy's revelation about Jane and Bingley too quickly, and the Pemberley scene is done poorly (more on that later).  But all in all, still terrific.My only objection to David Rintoul is that the novel doesn't make Darcy *that* uptight; Rintoul doesn't smile even a tenth of the times the novel says Darcy does.  At times he's so stiff and emotionless one wonders if Skynet didn't just send Terminators to 1984.  Still, Rintoul carries Darcy admirably and (at the risk of being pelted with rotten veggies) is a handsomer Darcy than Firth.  When he and Elizabeth are engaged and he finally smiles, it's beautiful, and it's all Darcy.  Much, *much* preferred to Macfayden's 2005 kicked-puppy looking Darcy.Garvie and Rintoul carry the major scenes beautifully.  Whoever did the shot where we first hear Elizabeth play and sing is brilliant; everyone stands stock still, and we see only Darcy moving between them, watching her.  It's powerful in its simplicity.  Some of the voiceovers of Lizzy's thoughts are annoying, but some are good; one nicely supplies the ultimate paradox of how Darcy supplied objections to Jane for Bingley but loves Lizzy so much he can't help but bypass them for Lizzy.Some complain '95's Ehle and Firth are too old.  If it's young-looking we're going for, I still prefer Garvie and Rintoul (whatever their ages) over Knightley and Macfayden, even if Rintoul wasn't that young when he did Darcy.  Garvie and Rintoul carry the relationship more closely to the novel.As completely enjoyable as Garvie and Rintoul are - and they are *well* worth the 4.5 hours - my favorites are still Ehle and Firth.  Darcy isn't entirely stiff in the novel and smiles quite a bit even in the first half.  Firth makes these tiny, unconscious smiles, and he shows hurt and delight far better even with the proud mask.  Ehle may not look the part, even with her wigs, but she conveys Lizzy's spirit the best - that sweet, pert confidence is always there, and until she discovers Darcy's true nature, it's very clear she doesn't care for his good opinion.  It's also far clearer when she's simply being polite and when she's truly happy; she doesn't use the same smile for both.As for the visit to Pemberley: I'm no wet-shirt-maniac (I don't get it: he's fully clothed and the shirt doesn't even stick to him), and purists can say what they will about that 1995 dip in the pond :) , but that innovation does a far better job of explaining why Darcy doesn't receive the Gardiners and Lizzy properly the first time he sees them; he's half-dressed.  In  this version he sees them, he's unbelievably cold, and then suddenly he reappears all charming.  It's like two different Darcies.  Also, Ehle's Elizabeth is more consistent.  She's mortified she's going to seem a gold-digging floozy, so she rushes to leave; Ehle conveys her dismay brilliantly.  In the 1980 version, Lizzy's embarrassment is confined to a short voiceover, but she doesn't leave and otherwise looks perfectly content, all in sharp contrast to her condemnation of her sisters' flirty behavior with the officers.  The awkwardness of their first meeting after the Hunsford refusal is also done far better in the '95 version than in its '80 predecessor.Still, a fabulous version and a must-see for a ""P&P;""

I feel it fails in some of the most interesting aspects of the book in that it doesn't capture the comedy and is far from being light, bright and sparkeling as JA herself described the story. Tongue in cheek she mentions in a letter that it 'wants more shade'. It seems to me that the actors and director introduced a bit too much shade.I respect Fay Weldon but take issue with the way she wrote the script to have the actors repeat what is actually narration in the book. This makes for very uncomfortable and heavy dialogue, which the actors are incapable of carrying off. Further, their acting is very wooden, and I do not find Rintoul in the least handsome except in profile, and while Elizabeth Garvie is a pretty girl, the actress who played Jane has the beautiful eyes that should be necessary in the actress who plays Lizzie's part.I found myself not caring in the least if Darcy and Lizzie or Jane and Mr. Bingley finally get together as there was no chemistry between those actors at all.  The actresses who played Lydia and Kitty were much too old for the part, as was the actress who played Mrs. Bennet. After all, Jane is but almost 23 and her mother surely would not have been more than 43 and was a beauty in her day.  Overall I felt almost the entire core cast was actually mis-cast.  Every single actor is entirely forgettable.The music was reminsiscent of an old BBC soap opera.I gave this movie 2 stars because the sets and costuming were spot on and is leaps and bounds better than the worst P&P; production of all time - that horrible 1940's Greer Garson movie where they are wearing Victorian, instead of Georgian/Regency clothing.I don't find the Ehle and Firth production in the least dumbed down and far prefer it.  In fact, that production has been more instrumental in bringing the works of Jane Austen to the 20th and 21st centuries than any other because it includes all the major elements, though perhaps not all the dialogue of the book. It captured the spirit of the bookIf you are a Janeite, by all means rent this movie.

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","This 1980 BBC miniseries adaptation of Jane Austen's classic romance novel ""Pride and Prejudice"" offers nearly five hours of good costume drama, location shooting in the English countryside, and a solid cast led by Elizabeth Garvie as the spirited Lizzie Bennet, whose feud with the proud Mr. Darcy (David Rintoul) is the core of the story.As fans know, the story begins with the arrival of the young, wealthy and single Mr. Bingley and his friends to take possession of the estate of Netherfield Park.  Their near-neighbors the Bennets, with five unmarried daughters, are anxious to meet Mr. Bingley and his friend Mr. Darcy at a country dance.  Misadventure at the dance lays the groundwork for a complicated relationship between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy.The length of the mini-series allows for inclusion of most of the dialogue from the novel, especially the interactions among the Bennets.  The series is perhaps a little challenged in delivering Lizzie's internal dialogue, while the stiff and silent Mr. Darcy doesn't get much chance to earn the sympathy of the audience until late in the production.  Inevitably, this production gets compared with the 1995 Grenada TV version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, and with the 2005 movie version starring Kiera Knightley and Matthew McFaydon.

Like so many others, I had purchased the VHS, 2 tape copy and was disappointed in seeing a good amount was edited out. I remember seeing it when it was aired on Masterpiece Theater over a five week period. It instantly become my favorite British presentation, apart from ""Flambards"".I have also seen the 1996 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I liked the version very much. Colin did an excellent portrayal of Mr. Darcy and Jennifer was a lovely Elizabeth, but I never forget this earlier version. I kept picturing Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul when I watched the newer P&P; and realized, they will always be Elizabeth and Darcy to me.This older version perfectly captured the overall feel of the novel. True, Rintoul's performance was stiff compared to Colin Firth's, but I honestly feel he really showed the proud and arrogant Mr. Darcy of Jane Austen's story. Sorry, but Colin Firth was just too likable. Elizabeth Garvie was dead on as Elizabeth. She was exactly how I pictured Elizabeth to be. Jennifer Ehle seemed too cheerful at times and was missing some of the archiness and wit that Garvie displayed.My favorite scene in this version was when Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at Pemberly. It was word for word from the book,  with every embarrassed look and uneasy feeling captured. The newer version I would said followed the story line more. There were several scenes in this older version that were condensed, such as when Elizabeth visits Charlotte in Hunsford. And the newer version adds scenes which I thought was unneccessary.I have a hard time choosing between the two version since both were wonderful in their own special way. But if I had to choose, then this 1979 version would be number one with the 1996, a very, very close second.

228735,A3UC29EJF2ZQP5,6300248569,Duckman,"[5, 5]","There have been several good adaptions of Pride and Prejudice. The most popular are, I expect, the very lavish BBC production starring Colin Firth and the recent Hollywood film version starring Keira Knightley.  A real Jane Austen fan will likely want to see them all. But for a lover of the book none IMO equals this not so lavish earlier BBC version.What makes it so exceptional? Several things.The first is the character of of Lizzy.  She's the girl you knew and loved in the book. Smart. Sassy. Opinionated. But most of all endearing.  Indeed every character you came to love in the book comes to life in the production as if they simply became flesh and blood and walked off the printed page,The second thing that makes this adaptation ""best"" for the Austen fan is that it has not been modernized. And why should it be? Jane Austen's greatest gift was her ability to see past custom into the common heart of mankind. That is why her books resonate with readers as much in the 21st century as they did in her own.Yes the sets and lighting are flat and the camerawork only of TV quality, but the script, character development and acting is so wonderful that this viewer at least didn't care a whit.

228736,A2R7RMWUXDJISH,6300248569,ED Denson,"[1, 1]","There are 4 film version of Pride and Prejudice, each with something to recommend them. This 4 hour version was done by the BBC around 1979, and it looks it. The color is washed out. I wish they would restore it, for there are some excellences not reached in the other versions, to be found here. I believe the best Jane is here. She is at least equal to Lizzy in beauty, and warm and expessive. The acting by all is well done, as is true for all acting in all versions except Wickham in the Keira Knightly P&P.; I'm afraid the costumers did Lizzy no favors in this film (see cover).  She often looks like an atrractive woman in the wrong clothes, today I am specially thinking of her blue travelling clothes when she goes to Pemberley.  These are my favorite Gardiners, too, especially Mrs. Gardiner, although Mr. Gardiner in the Knightly version is also strong.  Pemberly scenes, which are always my favorites, were done well. Our Pemberly here is not as imposing as in later versions, but suitable, and the visitors actually get to go on their walk in this version.  I was a bit surprised to find Lizzy at the inn in Lambton grasping her letters from Jane about Lydia's elopement, and then running from Lambton to Pemberley, altho Darcy brags of doing the run as a youth in the Knightly version. It's a long way. I prefer the wonderful scene in the Keira Knightly version, which is otherwise not as good at displaying Pemberly or the action there. (Unspoiler alert, I'm not going to describe it but it is wonderful.)I hadn't thought of it before, but this movie has voice overs of Elizabeth's thoughts. The novel often describes her thoughts, sometimes dramatizing them but frequently not, and this has always been a problem for people staging or making a film of the novel. Voice overs are not very dramatic. The letters run a close second in dramatic problems for the same reason, yet they deliver key information and must be included. Here they are generally given as voice overs, and shortened. In the Knightly version they are often dramatized, behind the voice overs, which works better as the dramatizations are the images the letters would create in the readers mind, we hope.Reasonably faithful to the book - especially in including some of the later scenes which are often skipped. The film, like all others, really does not go beyond the wedding (really, not to it). I'd love to see life at Pemberly with Lizzy and Mrs Gardiner going round the park in their low phaeton with a couple of ponies. But, it is not to be.One technical quibble other than the color: the film comes on an unlabeled 2-sided DVD. Difficult to know which side you are going to see when you get it in the player. They really should have gone the extra 30 cents for a second DVD.This is not my first choice for a P&P; film (Keira Knightly's is, today). It is my 3rd, but it is a pleasure to watch and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",4,Why Can't We Combine them All?,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,2923,"['are', '4', 'film', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'something', 'recommend', '4', 'hour', 'version', 'was', 'done', 'BBC', '1979', 'color', 'washed', 'wish', 'would', 'restore', 'are', 'excellences', 'not', 'reached', 'other', 'versions', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'believe', 'best', 'Jane', 'here', 'least', 'equal', 'Lizzy', 'beauty', 'warm', 'expessive', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'true', 'acting', 'versions', 'Wickham', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'P', 'P', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'costumers', 'did', 'Lizzy', 'favors', 'film', 'see', 'cover', 'often', 'atrractive', 'woman', 'wrong', 'clothes', 'today', 'am', 'specially', 'thinking', 'blue', 'travelling', 'clothes', 'when', 'Pemberley', 'are', 'favorite', 'Gardiners', 'too', 'especially', 'Mrs.', 'Gardiner', 'Mr.', 'Gardiner', 'Knightly', 'version', 'also', 'strong', 'Pemberly', 'scenes', 'are', 'always', 'favorites', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'Pemberly', 'here', 'not', 'as', 'imposing', 'later', 'versions', 'suitable', 'visitors', 'actually', 'get', 'go', 'walk', 'version', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'find', 'Lizzy', 'inn', 'Lambton', 'grasping', 'letters', 'Jane', 'Lydia', 'elopement', 'then', 'running', 'Lambton', 'Pemberley', 'altho', 'Darcy', 'brags', 'doing', 'run', 'youth', 'Knightly', 'version', 'long', 'way', 'prefer', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'version', 'otherwise', 'not', 'good', 'displaying', 'Pemberly', 'action', 'there', 'Unspoiler', 'alert', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'describe', 'wonderful', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'movie', 'voice', 'overs', 'Elizabeth', 'thoughts', 'novel', 'often', 'thoughts', 'sometimes', 'dramatizing', 'frequently', 'not', 'always', 'been', 'problem', 'people', 'staging', 'making', 'film', 'novel', 'Voice', 'overs', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'dramatic', 'letters', 'run', 'close', 'second', 'dramatic', 'problems', 'same', 'reason', 'yet', 'deliver', 'key', 'information', 'must', 'be', 'included', 'Here', 'are', 'generally', 'given', 'voice', 'overs', 'shortened', 'Knightly', 'version', 'are', 'often', 'dramatized', 'voice', 'overs', 'better', 'dramatizations', 'are', 'images', 'letters', 'would', 'create', 'readers', 'mind', 'hope.Reasonably', 'faithful', 'book', 'especially', 'including', 'later', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'skipped', 'film', 'others', 'really', 'not', 'go', 'wedding', 'really', 'not', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'life', 'Pemberly', 'Lizzy', 'Mrs', 'Gardiner', 'going', 'park', 'low', 'phaeton', 'couple', 'ponies', 'not', 'be.One', 'technical', 'quibble', 'other', 'color', 'film', 'unlabeled', '2-sided', 'DVD', 'Difficult', 'know', 'side', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'when', 'get', 'player', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'extra', '30', 'cents', 'second', 'DVD.This', 'not', 'first', 'choice', 'P', 'P', 'film', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'today', '3rd', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","Published in 1813, Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE received good reviews, proved popular with readers, and both author and novel have grown in stature with each passing year.  In the modern world, that stature has translated into performance adaptations, and there have been at least four stage versions and at least ten screen versions.  Interestingly, each version seems to have been extremely popular in its own day.  The Greer Garson version, for example, was widely admired in 1940; today, however, it is regarded as unduly glossy and distinctly miscast.  Most recently, the Keira Knightley version was liked in 2005; today it is considered secondary to other versions.  The major problem in adapting PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it would seem, is the sheer complexity of the story, which does not fit well within a two-hour run time, and in consequence there have been two mini-series, the Elizabeth Garvey version of 1980 and the Jennifer Ehle version of 1995. Produced by BBC, the Garvey version contained five episodes; produced by BBC and A&E;, the Ehle version contained six episodes.Like all Jane Austen works, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is essentially a comedy of manners, a satrical and ironic look at the way people must negotiate a complex set of courtesies and social restrictions to reach an ultimate goal.  The general story is very well known.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are country gentry with five daughters.  Since the estate is entailed, it is important that the daughters marry--and marry as well as possible.  When wealthy Mr. Bingley takes a nearby estate, he brings with him the proud Mr. Darcy.  Mr. Bingley is much admired by all and oldest daughter Jane falls in love with him.  Mr. Darcy, however, is widely disliked; he wounds second-oldest daughter Elizabeth's feelings, and she is further prejudiced against him when the newly-arrived Mr. Wickham tells several unsavory stories of Mr. Darcy.  But while Darcy interrupts Mr. Bingley's romance with Jane, it soon transpires that Wickham is a rake, and he elopes with Lydia, the youngest Bennett daughter.  This precipitates a social scandal that only Mr. Darcy can resolve, which he does in a manner most satisfying to all concerned.The 1980 mini-series is very much of the BBC of its era, which is to say that it is clearly done with an eye to economy.  Outside shots are few; interiors are clearly sets; costumes are correct for period but clearly pulled from pre-existing stock.  And indeed, the overall effect is that of a stage play with wordy dialogue.  But it also happens that the mini-series is extraordinarily, perhaps even flawlessly cast.  Elizabeth Garvey is the perfect Elizabeth Bennett, smart, sharp, and direct; David Rintoul equals her as the proud Mr. Darcy, and indeed every single supporting player is equally fine.  The dialogue is extracted from the novel without a great deal of fiddling, and screenwriter Fay Weldon does not make the mistake of ""adjusting"" Austen's words: this is indeed how the novel sounds when read, and while the lines are often complex, the actors render them meticulously.  Director Cyril Coke, also known for such BBC series as UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS; THE ONEDEN LINE; and THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET, sets the tempo and moves the actors with tremendous flair, grace, and charm.The 1995 Jennifer Ehle version has many fans, but I have always found it wildly miscast; neither Ehle nor Colin Firth seem of the period (indeed Firth seems more of a bootblack than a great gentleman), and Julia Sawalha's Lydia is nothing short of disastrous.  Yes, it is stagey, there is no denying that, but for me the 1980 mini-series is a truly fine adaptation, and when I return to the novel it is Elizabeth Garvey as Elizabeth Bennett I see before me.

I can't stop wanting it. My wife shared the same feeling with me. This is the true Jane Austen.I also watched A&E; 96 version, which isa real angel, I guess, too good for me -- I finished it with great anger. I particularly don't like the acting of Mrs. Bennet, it is all pretentious.*------------------------------------------------------* a more thorough review that I posted for 1995 verion:*------------------------------------------------------I cannot comment on this film (1995 A&E; version)without comparing it with the 1980 BBC's version. If I hadn't seen the 1980 BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice"", I would probably adore this 1995 film like many people here. However, I must say that except the lavish decoration, this film is far inferior to the 1980 BBC's P&P; in every respect: screenplay, performance, music, etc.It's a pity that quite a few people are mistaken Jane Austen's spirited novel with a simple romantic story; one reviewer even praised the film as an epic. In her book, Austen writes about a serious topic with subtle humor, which is exactly what A&E; version fails to capture. Both movies have added some lines or scenes based on the original novel, however, the Garvie/Rintoul is more true to the novel. Some people like A&E; version because of the ""extras"" it offers, while some of these are described on the book such as Mr. Dancy's preventing his sister eloping with Wickham and later his searching for Lydia and Wickham in London, others are merely screenwriter's add-ons, three examples here, the first is Colin Firth came out of his bath and saw Jennifer Ehle playing with a dog, the second is the wet Colin Firth encountered Jennifer Ehle unexpectedly in Pemberly, and the third is Colin Firth practices fencing to show his determination of winning back Jennifer Ehle's affection. These are ridiculous and unnecessary. At the same time, the A&E; version has missed or changed some important scenes that are essential to the book. For instance, Lizzy's first piano performance at Lucas' ball (instead, she went off to teach Lydia how to behave). Most of the interesting dialogues between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley are completely gone. Two in particular, one is after Mr. Darcy tells how he admires Elizabeth's beautiful eyes, the other is Miss Bingley's compliments about Mr. Darcy's writing. One dialogue is badly rewritten: in the book Mr. Darcy gives two reasons why he doesn't want to join Elizabeth and Miss Bingley in their walking about the room, here in the A&E; film, he's only shown half intelligent and sharp by omitting one reason. Also the part where Elizabeth observes and analyzes his father's attitude towards his wife is replaced by ""daily proof"". The last part where she analyzes how Mr. Darcy falls in love with her at the first place should have been kept.Regarding the acting, old BBC's version is more close to the period. Characters are more lady and gentlemen like. Characters in the A&E; version, on the contrary, do not behave as courtly as they should. Upon seeing Ehle crossing her arms when listening to her father's comments on her refusal to Mr. Collins' proposal, I dislike this Elizabeth considering her very rude.The A&E; version is entirely miscast with the exception of Charlotte or maybe Mr. Bennet. Jennifer Ehle misinterprets Lizzy totally. She's not even physically up to the description in the novel. She always reads her lines in a hurry and even needs to catch her breath in order to finish the sentence. She doesn't show any wit and appears proud and rude like the two Miss Bingley (when she went to visit her sick sister and came across with Colin Firth [another ""extra""], he appeared much more polite than she). Elizabeth Garvie's Lizzy is adorable, witty and beautiful. She IS Elizabeth, no doubt. Colin Firth is not a proud Darcy but rather a miserable one with gloomy eyes. David Rintoul may lack Firth's sensuality, but he IS the proud and satirical Mr. Darcy. A&E;'s Jane is not as sweet and beautiful as Sabina Franklyn's Jane. Bingley is OK but could be more candid. His sisters are hateful. Miss Bingley doesn't show any interest in pursuing Darcy (in the early BBC's version, Miss Bingley is perfectly portrayed by Marsha Fitzalan). Mr. Wickham is not as handsome and attractive as described in the book. Alison Steadman's Mrs. Benetts is nothing but noisy, Priscilla Morgan's Mrs. Bennet is a simple-minded mother whose entire interest is to have her 5 daughters well married. A&E;'s Mary is abominable while Tessa Peake-Jones's Mary is a young lovely bookworm with lot of comments. I particularly dislike David Bamber's Mr. Collins. He is not funny at all and appears despicable, Malcolm Rennie's Collins, instead is much more comical with his distinct long figure, awkward movements and some details such as the non-stop apology. Lady Catherine de Bourgh is OK but lack the bossiness as Judy Parfitt's portrayal of her.The music in 1980's version is a perfect match to the film.The A&E; version is a fine productin and a great entertainment, but definitely not Austen.",5,Evil,1050364800,"04 15, 2003",2003,5187,"['version', 'true', 'evil', 'watched', '6', 'times', 'now', 'sincethe', 'purchasing', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago',

228750,A17JVI15BRY90P,6300248569,James T. Wheeler,"[7, 7]","My wife and I saw this 1979 (Elizabeth Garvie) version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" in the early-1980's.  It was shown on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre--before we owned a VCR.  Five years later, we bought the VHS tape for $60, and were very happy to have it. Now here comes the DVD version with 39 extra minutes of valuable scenes that were not included in the VHS tape.  What a bargain this is!This version of the story is rather different from the 1995 Colin Firth series in that so much of it is done from Elizabeth's point of view.  She provides insights and commentary all along the way, some of which are mistaken.  If forced to choose, we'd tend to prefer the Colin Firth version, especially with him cast as Mr. Darcy.  Also, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett are played more whimsically and are more sympathetic characters in the 1995 edition.  Nevertheless, there is a lot to like in the 1979 version and would recommend that people buy both and compare.Lesser characters like Mr. and Mrs. Collins, the other Bennett sisters, Lady Catherine, and the Bingleys make for a study in contrast, 1979 vs. 1995.  Both versions are enjoyable for what they show of human nature.  Moreover, the natural scenery and background music in both productions are just outstanding.As to faithfulness to Jane Austen's book, both versions offer departures that are not necessarily bad.  Toward the end, where Lady Catherine confronts Elizabeth about her possible attachment to Darcy, the Colin Firth version really is closer to the book. (The scene is supposed to take place outside in Bennetts' side garden, not indoors. Nevertheless, Judy Parfitt plays Lady Catherine memorably in the 1979 version).  In some other areas, though, the 1979 version is more faithful to the author.

228751,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,6300248569,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[8, 10]","This 1979 BBC production of  ""Pride and Prejudice,"" based on a classic novel by Jane Austen, about the morals, mores, marriages and the class system in Georgian England, is superb! The casting is perfect, with one exception. Although David Rintoul delivers a good performance as the proud Fitzwilliam Darcy, I am one of those Colin Firth fans who can imagine no other in the role. Please don't hold it against me. I admit to my own prejudice! Directed by Cyril Coke (known for his other Masterpiece Theater work including ""Upstairs, Downstairs""), the script was written by novelist Fay Weldon, who perfectly translates the novel's witty dialogue to the screen. This adaptation includes some original scenes, as does the A&E; version. Here, Lizzy converses with her Aunt Gardiner on the subject of Mr. Wickham. She admits there's a possibility he is a scoundrel and promises not to be taken in by him. There's also the scene concerning Mr. Collin's ""Aquatic Life Hat"". And Malcolm Rennie's portrayal of Mr. Collins is terrific. It is obvious that this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" had a more limited budget than did the 1995 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. While the latter film is set in England's luxurious estates and country homes, this one uses television settings. Shown in the US on Masterpiece Theater in 1980, the movie was released in DVD format in an uninterrupted 225 minute 2 disc set, which has been digitally remastered.The film clearly reflects Ms. Austin's theories on the importance of marriage for women of the period. Most women were not educated, except for the social graces; acquiring, at least, some proficiency in music, needlework and ""acceptable"" literature, and learning skills essential to running a household. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry well, to obtain financial security and social position, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare.The film opens in a small community in Hertfordshire, England. Word is out that the empty Netherfield estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage, and, of course, gossiping. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well and settled, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also. Marriage is a serious business in this period.There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, (Osmond Bullock), the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, (Sabina Franklyn), the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett (Ms. Garvie), the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy, (Rintoul). Darcy, is much wealthier than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene and looks down his nose at the local gentry. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She has a strong intellect and her father had encouraged her to become literate, and to enjoy fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, spirited, with a sharp wit, more independent than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.Elizabeth and Darcy's strong mutual attraction, and the conflict between them, which prevents them from forming a potentially rich relationship, provide an interesting tension throughout the film. Darcy's proud arrogance in his social class and position, and Elizabeth's prejudice against such haughtiness, seem to inhibit all promise of romance.Ms. Austin's delightful characters, are brilliantly cast here, including: George Wickham, (Peter Settelen), a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, (Rennie), a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennetts, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, (Irene RIchard), a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, (A superb Judy Parfitt), the quintessential aristocrat. Elizabeth Garvie is a superb Lizzy Bennett. She sparkles with wit and intelligence, and is just beautiful enough to be believable. As I mentioned above, David Rintoul is a believable Darcy, but my personal preference is clear.The settings and costumes are accurate to the period. The dialogue is faithful to the novel. Watching the film, it is almost impossible not to feel transported back in time, and become very involved with the loves, foibles, problems, and adventures of the wonderful Austin characters, brought so realistically to life, in this amazing production.Unlike other reviewers, I think both A&E; and BBC productions are excellent and find many aspects that I like in both. I own both DVDs and watch them frequently. I'm a fan!!

228753,A2N2S9PPHMW016,6300248569,JDavid,"[1, 1]","This relatively old version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" holds up excellently.  While I also like the newer versions of Jane Austen's most famous novel, I think the 1980 version is a superb adaptation.  First, this version is very faithful to the book, in details and in spirit.  Second, the acting is terrific without being overstated or flashy.  Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul are outstanding in their portrayals of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy respectively.I was also moved by one subplot in particular, the film's sensitive and insightful depiction of Elizabeth Bennet's parents.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are unsuited for each other in interests and temperament.  Their lack of marital harmony is the dark undercurrent to their family life.  Mr. Bennet's bitterness, indifference and cynicism have caused him to neglect his daughters' upbringing, care and protection, as well as the potential improvement of his wife.  Mrs. Bennet's frivolous vanity and lack of moral depth have rubbed off on some of her daughters.  Yet despite these grave disappointments and failures, the Bennets still maintain their family unit and their family loyalty.  The price was high for both of them, but the results were also impressive.On the negative side the cinematography cannot compare to later versions.  The film, originally produced for British and Australian television, has the washed out look characteristic of television shot on leaner budgets.  One sees the same look in many other British television productions of the 70s and 80s.But this detracts not at all from the excellent screenplay, the attention to detail, the film's reserve and repudiation of trendy innovation and revisionism, and its faithfulness to the original story.  Unfortunately too many screenwriters, directors and actors feel they can use classical literature and a historical setting to project their own views and ideologies.  This at times may be interesting artistically, but usually twists or ruins the meaning of the original story and distorts history.  Even filmmakers who have no ambitious personal statement to make in a film adaptation will often throw in touches of extra romance, sensuality, and suspense to make an old classic more attractive to a wider range of viewers.  Using film and television to faithfully adapt the classics is much richer and more satisfying, because the film medium benefits from the very qualities that made the written work a classic in the first place.I highly recommend the 1980 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to anyone looking for a faithful and literary version of the classic and who will not be put off by the relative simplicity of the production.",5,"Excellent version, faithful to the book",1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,2667,"['relatively', 'old', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'up', 'excellently', 'also', 'newer', 'versions', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'most', 'famous', 'novel', 'think', '1980', 'version', 'superb', 'adaptation', 'First', 'version', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'details', 'spirit', 'Second', 'acting', 'terrific', 'being', 'overstated', 'flashy', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'are', 'outstanding', 'portrayals', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'respectively.I', 'was', 'also', 'moved', 'one', 'subplot', 'particular', 'film', 'sensitive', 'insightful', 'depiction', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'parents', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'are', 'unsuited', 'other', 'interests', 'temperament', 'lack', 'marital', 'harmony', 'dark', 'undercurrent', 'family', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'bitterness', 'indifference', 'cynicism', 'have', 'caused', 'neglect', 'daughters', 'upbringing', 'care', 'protection', 'as', 'well', 'potential', 'improvement', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'frivolous', 'vanity', 'lack', 'moral', 'depth', 'have', 'rubbed', 'off', 'daughters', 'grave', 'disappointments', 'failures', 'Bennets', 'still', 'maintain', 'family', 'unit', 'family', 'loyalty', 'price', 'was', 'high', 'results', 'were', 'also', 'impressive.On', 'negative', 'side', 'cinematography', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'later', 'versions', 'film', 'originally', 'produced', 'British', 'Australian', 'television', 'washed', 'out', 'look', 'characteristic', 'television', 'shot', 'leaner', 'budgets', 'One', 'same', 'look', 'many', 'other', 'British', 'television', 'productions', '70s', '80s.But', 'not', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'attention', 'detail', 'film', 'reserve', 'repudiation', 'trendy', 'innovation', 'revisionism', 'faithfulness', 'original', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'too', 'many', 'screenwriters', 'directors', 'actors', 'feel', 'can', 'use', 'classical', 'literature', 'historical', 'setting', 'project', 'own', 'views', 'ideologies', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'interesting', 'artistically', 'usually', 'twists', 'meaning', 'original', 'story', 'distorts', 'history', 'Even', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'have', 'ambitious', 'personal', 'statement', 'make', 'film', 'adaptation', 'will', 'often', 'throw', 'touches', 'extra', 'romance', 'sensuality', 'suspense', 'make', 'old', 'classic', 'more', 'attractive', 'wider', 'range', 'viewers', 'Using', 'film', 'television', 'faithfully', 'adapt', 'classics', 'much', 'richer', 'more', 'satisfying', 'film', 'medium', 'benefits', 'very', 'made', 'written', 'work', 'classic', 'first', 'place.I', 'highly', 'recommend', '1980', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'anyone', 'looking', 'faithful', 'literary', 'version', 'classic', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'relative', 'simplicity', 'production']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

He brought real passion to the role with just a glance.  Now, to this movie, the BBC mini series, I have no idea when I bought it but a few days ago I saw it there on the shelf so I started looking at it.  Both the women leads are extremely good and very attractive. I did have a little trouble at first determining which was Lizzie and which was Jane as they look very much alike.  If you look at the Colin Firth version, neither of the lead women are very attractive and Jane is actually plain with a huge neck. In this version, David Rintoul as Darcy is definitely a one note actor and you actually don't feel any of his supposed passion for Elizabeth. He is the most wooden actor I've ever seen in any role.  Nor does the actor in the role of Bingley seem all that much enthralled with Jane. I do wish there was some way to let the audience know what a really silly and stupid woman Mrs. Bennet is without having her in so many scenes. In every version I've ever seen I just want to slap her silly and often fast forward through many of her scenes. The most odious performance of this role is in the Colin Firth version. They reeeeely overdid it on that one.  The reading of the Mrs. Bennet role in this BBC mini series is made more annoying by the fact that they stick her in almost every scene during the first part of the movie and one always wonders why her husband hasn't killed her years ago. The most sympathetic reading of the role is in the Keira Knightly version but she still grates on the nerves. As in many BBC movies, this version tends to drag a bit and include many scenes that could have been omitted without hurting the production at all. I like this BBC version better than the Colin Firth version but, as I said, the far superior film is the Keira Knightly movie. She really captures Lizzie and though they have taken some liberties with the story it just makes it better.  To be honest, I find Jane Austen's books to be wordy to the point of boring and everybody just talks, talks, talks to the point where one wants to just scream ""for the love of pete, get on with it"".

228759,A8F2AZWB20X1H,6300248569,JLind555,"[35, 38]","""Pride and Prejudice"" has been filmed three times: once in the early 1940s starring Greer Garson as Elizabeth Bennet, again in 1980 when it was presented by BBC as a five-part series on Masterpiece Theater, and finally in 1996, as a six-part series on the A&E; channel. The second version is the least known, which is too bad, because it's definitely the best of the three.I was delighted when at long last they put the BBC version on DVD.  It was previously available as a two-set VHS, but with many scenes cut out of the original as it was presented on Masterpiece Theater.  The DVD restores the original in five parts.  If this does break up the continuity a bit, it also lets you watch it in increments if you don't want to view it all at once (at 4 and a half hours, it's a lengthy film), without missing anything.Most people who watched the A&E; version of the book were drawn by the casting of Colin Firth in the role of Darcy. Let me say with some trepidation, lest I get jumped en masse and drawn and quartered by Firth groupies, that I thought he was miscast in that role. The BBC version had no big names, but the casting was almost perfect. Greer Garson in the role of Elizabeth Bennett in the Hollywood movie was ridiculous, a 36 year old actress playing a 20 year old ingenue; she should have been cast as Elizabeth's mother.  Jennifer Ehle in the role of Elizabeth in the A&E; film was excellent. But whereas Ehle did a very fine job playing Elizabeth Bennet, Elizabeth Garvie, in the BBC version, WAS Elizabeth Bennet.Of all the three films made of the book, The BBC version stays closest to the book by far. The Hollywood film turned the book inside out until one almost couldn't tell what book the film was based on, and the A&E; version, although it adhered fairly close to the book, took the liberty of rewriting some of Austen's famous lines. One does not rewrite Austen. Period.The cast of the BBC version is superb. Elizabeth Garvie is so much Elizabeth Bennet that she could have been invented for the part. She brings out all the character's lively intelligence, impulsiveness and spirit. She even looks like Elizabeth Bennet as Austen describes her, with her petite, slender frame and her enormous dark eyes. She brings the part so much to life that we imagine we are seeing her just as Austen meant her to be.David Rintoul as Darcy aroused some criticism among some viewers who complained that his portrayal of Darcy is ""wooden"". Well, let's face it, Darcy was wooden in the book. Did Darcy ever crack a smile except in the last two chapters? Firth wanted to create his own conception of Darcy; sensitive, vulnerable, very much a 90's Darcy. He did a convincing job of it; the only problem is, Firth's Darcy isn't Austen's Darcy. Darcy jumping into a lake?  Please.  Rintoul portrays Darcy just as Austen wrote him, and he certainly looks the part -- tall, dark, stunningly handsome, very much the rich arrogant snob asking for a comeuppance. The interplay between Garvie and Rintoul is delightful, much more so than Ehle and Firth. Garvie and Rintoul are more of a contrast, as Austen meant them to be; her sparkling wit and vivacity is set off by his steadiness and gravity. Two of the best scenes in the film are when Elizabeth refuses Darcy's proposal, and when they run into each other at Pemberley. When Elizabeth tells Darcy he's the last man in the world she could ever be prevailed on to marry, her eyes flash enough sparks to set him on fire. And at their meeting at Pemberley, their mutual confusion and embarrassment, as portrayed by Garvie and Rintoul, is priceless to behold.The other cast members look and act just as we picture them while reading the book. Mr. Bennet is a benevolent, impatient authority figure, his contempt for his wife's stupidity abundant in every line. Mrs. Bennet is a ditzy airhead, concerned only with gossip, the latest fashions, and marrying off her five daughters. The sisters all give competent performances but Sabina Franklyn is especially worth watching as the serenely beautiful Jane Bennet. The one disappointment was Lady Catherine DeBourgh. I had pictured her as a heavy-set Gorgon of a woman, and here she appears as a dried-up shrew, although she's evil enough. But Mr. Collins is dead-on perfect; a hilarious mixture of pomposity and servility. My favorite character of all in this production is Elizabeth's Aunt Gardiner as played by Barbara Shelley; her calm reassurance and common sense are exactly what Elizabeth needs to support her under her own confused feelings about Darcy, and when she is faced with the family crisis caused by Lydia's elopement with Wickham.Ably directed by Cyril Coke, this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the one to watch. It's truest to the book and the characters are as Austen wrote them.

The three more recent versions all have superior characterizations in one or more aspects, in my judgment.  There is no version, unless I have carelessly overlooked something, which portrays Lydia as the ""tallest"" of the five Bennet sisters,  which Jane Austen's character asserts in the book.I do not think the longest version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth will ever be equalled for its sheer beauty of filming, depth of character development,  and, for me at least, the very moving scene of Elizabeth's visit to Pemberley.  I do prefer the choice made by this version for Jane.  The story repeatedly refers to Jane as being the most beautiful of the Bennet girls, but is not accurate in my preferred version.  This version has it better.  Although the treatment of George Wickham is quite well done here, the lack of time available does not allow it to match up to my preferred version.

I'm wondering if there was another version (PBS, maybe?) prior to 1990. Overall, this is a good telling of Pride and Prejudice, if you can get past the fact that it IS a bit dated.  It is difficult to write a review of this version without comparing it to the 1995 version, because they are both good, and come closer to representing the book than the alternatives, including the horrible 2005 version.Casting and character development - What is good about this version:  Jane was prettier than in the 1995 version.  (Susannah York in the 1995 version was pretty, but the way they styled her hair did not really suit the shape of her face.)  Lydia seems a little sweeter than in the '95 version - silly, capable of being led astray, boy-crazy, but not as trampy.  I think this is more accurate.  Mrs. Bennet, too, seems more harmless in this version.  She is silly, she lacks a sense of propriety, but she is more likeable. The overall casting of the Bennet girls is better - their facial features bear enough similarities that they look like they could be siblings. What is not as good:  Lizzy doesn't have quite enough spark to her.  Jennifer Ehle may have been a bit over-the-top in 1995, but she seemed more the lively Eliza Bennet I pictured when reading the book.  Kitty seems a little too old.  Also, I missed Maria Lucas.  Sure, she was a background character, but she provided a contrast with Elizabeth in her behavior toward Lady Catherine.  Without her, Charlotte had to become more obsequious.  In a five hour series, they could have left her in, maybe even had her become the person who got in the way in the scene after Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy come to dinner at the Bennet's, instead of some strange woman suddenly appearing in the end of the movie. (The woman who prevents, at first, Elizabeth from being able to speak with Mr. Darcy.)  Georgiana seemed a bit underdeveloped, too. I don't remember her actually playing or singing, despite the fact that her musical ability is much touted. The Pemberley scenes feel rushed.  Also, Anne de Bourgh seems a little too likeable.  She doesn't look as sickly, and gives the impression that maybe she really is nice when she seems to want to embrace Elizabeth when they take leave of each other.The music/costuming/cinematography - this was the reason I only gave the movie three stars, rather than four.  The background music was just GOOFY through most of the movie.  The cinematography was poor quality.  I felt like I was watching reruns of episodes of All My Children from the early 1980s - which was kind of amusing, but distracted from the story.  The costumes were tolerable, but both costumes and hair were somehow reminiscent of the late 1970s early 1980s.  While it did not totally ruin the production, it was a distraction.Overall, this was a fun rendition to watch.  I can understand why some people prefer this to the 1995 A&E; version, but I have to say I prefer the 1995.",3,Another review comparing 1980/1995,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,3062,"['believe', 'may', 'have', 'watched', 'English', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'yet', ""n't"", 'quite', 'way', 'remembered', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'was', 'version', 'PBS', 'maybe', 'prior', '1990', 'Overall', 'good', 'telling', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'bit', 'dated', 'difficult', 'write', 'review', 'version', 'comparing', '1995', 'version', 'are', 'good', 'come', 'closer', 'representing', 'book', 'alternatives', 'including', 'horrible', '2005', 'version.Casting', 'character', 'development', 'What', 'good', 'version', 'Jane', 'was', 'prettier', '1995', 'version', 'Susannah', 'York', '1995', 'version', 'was', 'pretty', 'way', 'styled', 'hair', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'suit', 'shape', 'face', 'Lydia', 'little', 'sweeter', ""'95"", 'version', 'silly', 'capable', 'being', 'led', 'astray', 'boy-crazy', 'not', 'trampy', 'think', 'more', 'accurate', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'too', 'more', 'harmless', 'version', 'silly', 'sense', 'propriety', 'more', 'likeable', 'overall', 'casting', 'Bennet', 'girls', 'better', 'facial', 'features', 'bear', 'enough', 'similarities', 'look', 'could', 'be', 'siblings', 'What', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Lizzy', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'enough', 'spark', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'over-the-top', '1995', 'seemed', 'more', 'lively', 'Eliza', 'Bennet', 'pictured', 'when', 'reading', 'book', 'Kitty', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'Also', 'missed', 'Maria', 'Lucas', 'Sure', 'was', 'background', 'character', 'provided', 'contrast', 'Elizabeth', 'behavior', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Charlotte', 'had', 'become', 'more', 'obsequious', 'five', 'hour', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'maybe', 'even', 'had', 'become', 'person', 'who', 'got', 'way', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'come', 'dinner', 'Bennet', 'instead', 'strange', 'woman', 'suddenly', 'appearing', 'end', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'first', 'Elizabeth', 'being', 'able', 'speak', 'Mr', 'Darcy', 'Georgiana', 'seemed', 'bit', 'underdeveloped', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'actually', 'playing', 'singing', 'fact', 'musical', 'ability', 'much', 'touted', 'Pemberley', 'scenes', 'feel', 'rushed', 'Also', 'Anne', 'de', 'Bourgh', 'little', 'too', 'likeable', ""n't"", 'look', 'sickly', 'impression', 'maybe', 'really', 'nice', 'when', 'want', 'embrace', 'Elizabeth', 'when', 'take', 'leave', 'other.The', 'music/costuming/cinematography', 'was', 'reason', 'only', 'gave', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'rather', 'four', 'background', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'GOOFY', 'most', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'was', 'poor', 'quality', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'reruns', 'episodes', 'All', 'My', 'Children', 'early', '1980s', 'was', 'kind', 'amusing', 'distracted', 'story', 'costumes', 'were', 'tolerable', 'costumes', 'hair', 'were', 'somehow', 'reminiscent', 'late', '1970s', 'early', '1980s', 'did', 'not', 'totally', 'ruin', 'production', 'was', 'distraction.Overall', 'was', 'fun', 'rendition', 'watch', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'prefer', '1995', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'have', 'say', 'prefer', '1995']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

While all Austen novels revolve around the universally acknowledged truth that, ""a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,"" her protagonists are always of the fairer sex.Jane Austen novels are set at a slower time and written for people who had the time to read them.  They are leisurely affairs to be read over days.  That production, with 265 minutes on a two-sided disk has the time to develop the plot.  Although the opening scene is significantly altered from Austen's novel, whole pages of text are presented verbatim.  Unfortunately, the acting is more like that of a stage production with long lines of dialogue.  The actors often delivered their lines word for word from the book but these were talking heads.  They regularly stood tall and stiff with only slight interaction with the set and sadly limited facial expression or feeling.  Mr. Collins, in this version, is closer to the person described by Austen, handsome not all that bright and overly concerned with class and status.  The cinematography is generally good but sometimes the lighting would leave faces in shadow for no apparent reason.  The musical score was weak and dated.  My wife, also an aficionado of period movies, felt this version was agony and quit watching.While there is a 1939 version of Pride and Prejudice, with Maureen O'Sullivan, I have not yet seen it.  The three versions I have seen and reviewed are the 1996 BBC and A&E; version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, the 2005 Universal Studios version with Keira Knightley and this 1985 BBC production.

228777,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300248569,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 9]","It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" must be in want of a great Mr. Darcy. On that score David Rintoul is the weak link in the BBC's 1980 mini-series, which provides one of the most faithful adaptations of Jane Austen's novel to date.  The role of Fitzwilliam Darcy is tricky because we have to agree with Elizabeth Bennet's harsh judgment that he is the personification of pride early on, be surprised when he offers the most backhanded proposal in English literature, and then warm towards him as Lizzie's opinion change and her affections follow.  On the basis of that transformation rather than on his good looks I still favor Colin Firth in the 1995 BBC as the best Darcy of the bunch having seen six of the ten dating back to the 1938 television version that aired two years before the 1940 MGM movie with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.  There is one moment in this mini-series where Rintoul's Darcy lets down his guard, and his eyebrows, and it is for but a brief scene.  The difference between the haughty Mr. Darcy we meet at the beginning and the happy romantic we are supposed to see at the end is so minimal that you might not even see it.The rest of the cast fulfills our expectations of the characters in the novel, although I would say that I thought Elizabeth (Elizabeth Garvie) was the best looking one of the Bennet daughters, an honor that is supposed to obviously go to her older sister, Jane (Sabina Frakyln).  But since we are supposed to love Lizzie the best, this is a minor point of contention.  Mr. Bennet (Moray Watson) is still long suffering, Mrs. Bennet (Priscilla Morgan) is insufferable, and I still want to shake some sense into Lydia (Natalie Ogle) from the moment she first appears.  As soon as I recognized Judy Parfitt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh I knew that was a spot-on casting.  I especially liked Tessa Peake-Jones as Mary Bennet and Irene Richard as Charlotte Lucas, which made up for finding Malcolm Rennie's Mr. Collins too much the buffoon.  Director Cyril Coke filmed on location in the beautiful English countryside and certainly focuses on capturing all of the nuances of 18th century life among the gentry.The strength of the production is its overall fidelity to Austen's novel, although I was a bit worried at first when screenwriter Fay Weldon took the novel's famous opening line, split it between Jane and Lizzie, and starting to work in the rest of the opening exposition as dialogue.  But then Mrs. Bennet bursts in and we are clearly on track.  All things considered this is the most restrained version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" that I have seen to date, wherein Mr. Bennet and his two eldest daughters most closely match the Bingleys and Darcys of this world in terms of calm restraint.  I really like the 2005 theatrical version of the story because it is crystal clear to me when Darcy falls for Elizabeth and when she falls for him, and I have to say that in this BBC production you really have to wait to hear the words come out of their mouths and then you are not particularly inclined to believe either one of them.  Still, so much of the familiar dialogue Austen wrote made it into this one that it is worth sitting through the entire 265 minutes of the five-part mini-series at least once if you are an Austen fan.  Final Note: This is the version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" that is included in the BBC's ""Jane Austen Collection"" of DVDs, which is how I finally got to check it out (and as soon as it was over my oldest daughter and I went to the theater to watch the Keira Knightley version again).",4,The 1980 BBC version is certainly faithful to Jane Austen's novel,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,3614,"['truth', 'universally', 'acknowledged', 'production', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'must', 'be', 'want', 'great', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'score', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'weak', 'link', 'BBC', '1980', 'mini-series', 'one', 'most', 'faithful', 'adaptations', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'date', 'role', 'Fitzwilliam', 'Darcy', 'tricky', 'have', 'agree', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'harsh', 'judgment', 'personification', 'pride', 'early', 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'most', 'backhanded', 'proposal', 'English', 'literature', 'then', 'warm', 'towards', 'Lizzie', 'opinion', 'change', 'affections', 'follow', 'basis', 'transformation', 'rather', 'good', 'looks', 'still', 'favor', 'Colin', 'Firth', '1995', 'BBC', 'best', 'Darcy', 'bunch', 'having', 'seen', 'six', 'ten', 'dating', 'back', '1938', 'television', 'version', 'aired', 'two', 'years', '1940', 'MGM', 'movie', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'one', 'moment', 'mini-series', 'where', 'Rintoul', 'Darcy', 'down', 'guard', 'eyebrows', 'brief', 'scene', 'difference', 'haughty', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'meet', 'beginning', 'happy', 'romantic', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'end', 'so', 'minimal', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'it.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'expectations', 'characters', 'novel', 'would', 'say', 'thought', 'Elizabeth', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'was', 'best', 'looking', 'one', 'Bennet', 'daughters', 'honor', 'supposed', 'obviously', 'go', 'older', 'sister', 'Jane', 'Sabina', 'Frakyln', 'are', 'supposed', 'love', 'Lizzie', 'best', 'minor', 'point', 'contention', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'Moray', 'Watson', 'still', 'long', 'suffering', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Priscilla', 'Morgan', 'insufferable', 'still', 'want', 'shake', 'sense', 'Lydia', 'Natalie', 'Ogle', 'moment', 'first', 'As', 'soon', 'recognized', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'knew', 'was', 'spot-on', 'casting', 'especially', 'liked', 'Tessa', 'Peake-Jones', 'Mary', 'Bennet', 'Irene', 'Richard', 'Charlotte', 'Lucas', 'made', 'up', 'finding', 'Malcolm', 'Rennie', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'too', 'much', 'buffoon', 'Director', 'Cyril', 'Coke', 'filmed', 'location', 'beautiful', 'English', 'countryside', 'certainly', 'capturing', 'nuances', '18th', 'century', 'life', 'gentry.The', 'strength', 'production', 'overall', 'fidelity', 'Austen', 'novel', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'first', 'when', 'screenwriter', 'Fay', 'Weldon', 'took', 'novel', 'famous', 'opening', 'line', 'split', 'Jane', 'Lizzie', 'starting', 'work', 'rest', 'opening', 'exposition', 'dialogue', 'then', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'are', 'clearly', 'track', 'things', 'considered', 'most', 'restrained', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'wherein', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'two', 'eldest', 'daughters', 'most', 'closely', 'match', 'Bingleys', 'Darcys', 'world', 'terms', 'calm', 'restraint', 'really', '2005', 'theatrical', 'version', 'story', 'crystal', 'clear', 'when', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'when', 'have', 'say', 'BBC', 'production', 'really', 'have', 'wait', 'hear', 'words', 'come', 'mouths', 'then', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'inclined', 'believe', 'one', 'Still', 'so', 'much', 'familiar', 'dialogue', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'made', 'one', 'worth', 'sitting', 'entire', '265', 'minutes', 'five-part', 'mini-series', 'least', 'once', 'are', 'Austen', 'fan', 'Final', 'Note', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'included', 'BBC', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Collection', 'DVDs', 'how', 'finally', 'got', 'check', 'out', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'went', 'theater', 'watch', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'version', 'again']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

Delaney,"[3, 3]","Now that I've seen both this version and the 1995 A&E; version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, I have to say that this BBC version has become my favorite. It wasn't in the beginning but by the end I was in love. The A&E; version is probably a lot more relatable for people because it is pretty lively and zesty. The emotions are more apparent and you don't have to do a lot of picking apart of the scenes in the A&E; version. That makes it more approachable than this BBC 1980's take on the story.Subtle is the word that I would use to describe this miniseries and that's what eventually captured my heart. The reason that I LOVE BBC historicals is the subtlety. Two people look at each other and it's like a declaration of love. At the beginninig I felt as if the movie was a bit stiff but after the first hour I was enchanted. David Rintoul plays a very restrained and quiet version of Mr.Darcy. I felt like Rintoul's Mr.Darcy was way more enamored of Elizabeth than Colin Firth's version. He couldn't take his eyes off of her, tried to make conversation even though he was pretty awful at it and the proposal scene...it was endearing how horribly that went for Darcy. I really felt like Rintoul excellently played Mr.Darcy as a man who has no idea what to do with himself when he finds that he's in love.Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth. Loved her. Absolutely loved her. She was a woman with a srong mind and opinion who gets a muddled up when she's so dead set on one idea that she misses the truth of what's going on and forgets that there are always two sides to a story. As much as I loved Elizabeth Gavie's performance and am quite aware that she gets the most screen time of anyone, it's Mr.Darcy who really stole the show in this one.So, because of the fact that I feel this BBC version isn't as in-your-face as the A&E; version, I love it in all of its glory.

Fay Weldon's script stayed faithful to the book without destroying the excitement or lessening its pleasures. I especially liked the end which was too short and precipitate in the '95 version: there you had no time to enjoy the part before Elizabeth & Darcy actually profess their love for each other, here it was more detailed and leisurely, which I found very positive. To my disappointment in the '95 version there was no scene with Mrs Bennet rejoicing over Lizzy's engagement which is of course much more fun than Mr Bennet expressing his concerns and doubts. Here the excellent Priscilla Morgan was given the chance and I liked it very much.The actors were all excellent. Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennet both physically and spiritually. Her sparkling eyes expressed all her emotions, her wit, playfulness and intelligence - just as Jane Austen described her. I actually liked Jennifer Ehle's performance up to now, but compared to Garvie she fades away and I actually discovered that she SMIRKS instead of smiling playfully or even mischievously. Garvie could act playfully and even challengingly without being impertinent or impolite: J Ehle simply couldn't.David Rintoul was also excellent, although I admit that I prefer Colin Firth's Darcy, but I found him a bit too rigid and aloof for a while. I know, I know, Darcy IS rigid and aloof, but I couldn't spot any difference in his behaviour towards strangers and his friends the Bingleys: he didn't looked relaxed for a second even in their company. However when I saw his ""almost smile"" in his eyes and on his lips he started to grow on me gradually. I still thought his acting monotonous occasionally, but I learned to like him.I also liked Barbara Shelley and Michael Lees as Mr & Mrs Gardiner: they were truly genteel and sensible, once again what Jane Austen might have in mind. Priscilla Morgan as Mrs Bennet and Malcolm Rennie (Mr Collins) looked and acted their part tremendously.This version is more like it was adapted to the stage (the other is a true movie adaptation, more dynamic) but after getting used to its pace I did not mind it at all.Clearly, this version did not have the budget the other did, but it did not spoil neither costume, nor scenery nor the lovely music.This is a must see adaptation for all Austen and P&P; fans.",5,A most faithful and delightful adaptation,1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,2573,"['P', 'P', 'book', 'fan', 'decided', 'purchase', 'available', 'adaptations', 'have', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'amazon.co.uk', 'website', 'raise', 'curiosity', 'bought', ""'80"", 'BBC', 'version.First', 'let', 'tell', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'pure', 'delight', 'Fay', 'Weldon', 'script', 'stayed', 'faithful', 'book', 'destroying', 'excitement', 'lessening', 'pleasures', 'especially', 'liked', 'end', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'precipitate', ""'95"", 'version', 'there', 'had', 'time', 'enjoy', 'part', 'Elizabeth', 'Darcy', 'actually', 'profess', 'love', 'other', 'here', 'was', 'more', 'detailed', 'leisurely', 'found', 'very', 'positive', 'disappointment', ""'95"", 'version', 'was', 'scene', 'Mrs', 'Bennet', 'rejoicing', 'Lizzy', 'engagement', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'Mr', 'Bennet', 'expressing', 'concerns', 'doubts', 'Here', 'excellent', 'Priscilla', 'Morgan', 'was', 'given', 'chance', 'liked', 'very', 'much.The', 'actors', 'were', 'excellent', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'IS', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'physically', 'spiritually', 'sparkling', 'eyes', 'expressed', 'emotions', 'wit', 'playfulness', 'intelligence', 'just', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'described', 'actually', 'liked', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'performance', 'now', 'compared', 'Garvie', 'away', 'actually', 'discovered', 'SMIRKS', 'instead', 'smiling', 'playfully', 'even', 'mischievously', 'Garvie', 'could', 'act', 'playfully', 'even', 'challengingly', 'being', 'impertinent', 'impolite', 'J', 'Ehle', 'simply', ""couldn't.David"", 'Rintoul', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'admit', 'prefer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Darcy', 'found', 'bit', 'too', 'rigid', 'aloof', 'while', 'know', 'know', 'Darcy', 'IS', 'rigid', 'aloof', 'could', ""n't"", 'spot', 'difference', 'behaviour', 'towards', 'strangers', 'friends', 'Bingleys', 'did', ""n't"", 'looked', 'relaxed', 'second', 'even', 'company', 'However', 'when', 'saw', 'almost', 'smile', 'eyes', 'lips', 'started', 'grow', 'gradually', 'still', 'thought', 'acting', 'monotonous', 'occasionally', 'learned', 'like', 'him.I', 'also', 'liked', 'Barbara', 'Shelley', 'Michael', 'Lees', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Gardiner', 'were', 'truly', 'genteel', 'sensible', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'might', 'have', 'mind', 'Priscilla', 'Morgan', 'Mrs', 'Bennet', 'Malcolm', 'Rennie', 'Mr', 'Collins', 'looked', 'acted', 'part', 'tremendously.This', 'version', 'more', 'was', 'adapted', 'stage', 'other', 'true', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'more', 'dynamic', 'getting', 'used', 'pace', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'all.Clearly', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'other', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'spoil', 'costume', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'music.This', 'must', 'see', 'adaptation', 'Austen', 'P', 'P', 'fans']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

Thank goodness for this dvd because my videotape is about to wear out!  I just think this version feels closer to the book somehow. There are no tight bodices or a wet shirt Mr. Darcy, but it is enjoyable and engaging all the same. I love Elizabeth Garvie as Lizzy Bennet. She just completely captures the spirit of Elizabeth Bennet for me: playful, pretty, charming, witty and engaging, and with those lovely big brown eyes. David Rintoul is a handsome, aristocratic Darcy and all the actors are perfectly cast. I must say I always had a problem with the casting of Jane Bennet (not pretty enough), the Bingley sisters (no resemblance) and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner (not elegant at all) in the 1995 version, but not so here. Jane is perfectly amiable and lovely in the guise of Sabina Franklin and the Gardiners are elegant and well-bred as they should be. The actresses who play Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley also do look like sisters.  There is also no over-the-top acting which sometimes overshadowed other actors/characters.The only downside of this version is, of course, that the budget was less than its 1995 counterpart and so most of the filming took place on sets instead of on the real thing. The costumes and locations are simpler.  However, the actors and story treatment more than make up for its shortcomings and this version is a must have for any Jane Austen fan's movie library.

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the most frequently adapted of her works, but while most begin well frequently time constraints cause the director to compress and change frantically in the middle or the end until what one has is a travesty rather than an adaption.  The lovely thing about this BBC adaption is that time is taken.  The plot proceeds, by and large, as Jane wrote it, with letters being written and read in the voice of the character who wrote them with the recipient reacting for the camera.  This causes the action to unfold in a way that matches my visualization when I read the book. I did note the omission of one scene near the end. The scene where Elizabeth has to convince her father that she has changed her mind about Darcy has sadly been omitted, but this is the only major scene from the book that does not occur in this adaption.Another match for my fictional reverie is the way the cast so completely inhabit their roles.  David Rintoul may not be the most passionate Darcy, but his striking appearance and stately air match my impression of this character.  Elizabeth Garvie is a lively, witty Elizabeth Bennett complete to the sparkling eyes. All the other characters are well done: Mr. Collins, Bingley, and the Bennett sisters.

I did like her though.I do have one question...WHO wrote this sad sad script???? and why was Elizabeth, after Darcy proposed, smiling and quirky??? this jerk just asked her to marry her against his better thoughts and wishes and COMPLETELY dissed her family and called them idiots... yep i would really act like that in that situation... she obviously needs a life coachanother thing, after Darcy gives Elizabeth the letter explaining everything the camera is watching Darcy walk away... this actor... (sorry to say) can't walk.. it's like watching a scowling, stomping duck waddle away.

MCCOSKER,"[10, 25]","There's tendency for reviewers here to compare this miniseries version (the 1980 BBC one) of Jane Austen's classic novel with the 1995 A&E; miniseries of the same. (Actually, the A&E; version was coproduced with the BBC, but for simplicity's sake everybody ignores that. BBC, by the way, has a long history of periodically dramatizing *Pride and Prejudice*, but only these two most recent versions are available on DVD.) If both versions were roughly equally wonderful, one could then recommend both. But, alas, one is as close to a masterpiece as dramatic television ever gets, while the other adds nothing to the original novel -- and begs why but for laziness any viewer should watch it when that viewer could be profitably reading or rereading the novel.This 1980 BBC version is defended because it's truer to plot and characterization details of the novel. What such defenders don't seem to appreciate is that narrative fiction and film are very different art forms, and that the successful adaptation of ideas from one to another is very much a creative undertaking. Dramatized unimaginatively, Austen's lively character studies and sly comedy of manners become a bloodless soap opera.Beyond suffering from a much inferior script, this version -- as opposed to its A&E; successor -- must've suffered from a paltry budget, which adversely affected all aspects of the production. The cameras are videotape, not the true-to-life film of A&E.; The cinematography is static, not animated. The actors are mediocre, not talented. The performances are underrehearsed, not polished. The editing is abrupt, not inviting.Conversely, the A&E; version richly fleshes out the novel, and has a life of its own. Yes, it takes some liberties with the novel -- because the built-in narrative of a novel can explain things that must be presented as action in a teleplay. If you want the novel, read the novel: one of the very best ever written. If you want to see an almost sublimely marvelous television miniseries which happens to be adapted from that novel, get -- own, because you'll want to see it again and again -- the A&E.;This BBC miniseries is a waste of time to watch not because it's awful, but because it's superfluously mediocre.

Since I can only judge it based on my own character, I give it 5 stars.Like other similar BBC adaptations, this miniseries takes its time and explores the dialog and thought processes of the characters and clearly establishes the social conventions of the time and how they influenced the behavior of the characters. In the case of Pride and Prejudice, this is extremely important for the viewer to understand since Mr. Darcy's motivations are rooted in those conventions initially. In fact, the A & E miniseries (which is so often compared to other versions) didn't seem to make this quite as clear as this version.Each of the characters is adequately fleshed out and the relationships slowly developed. The production values are on par with other similar BBC series (such as Jane Eyre) but one doesn't watch these for their lavish eye candy. It's much more like watching a play in 5 installments.If you need a brisk pace in whatever you view and obvious romantic overtures displayed onscreen, you probably won't enjoy this adaptation.

It is the one closest to the book with the absolute best Bennett family, the best Mr. Collins and Charlotte, a perfect Jane and Lizzie and a pretty awesome Darcy.I know that generally Darcy's portrayal in this version is seen as overly stiff, but if you read the book and you pay close attention to David Rintoul's performance you will begin to understand the subtle genius of his acting. Just as in the book and in keeping with the mores of the time period, his reactions are somewhat stilted, guarded, his interest in Lizzie covert, his outward manner indifferent. Very often Rintoul manages to convey his character's feelings through a simple twitch of his cheek or a slightly longer look but he is always proper in the 19th century British sense, always upright, never emotionally revealing.Mrs. Bennett and Mr.Bennett are played to perfection with a strong dose of wit and irony. Jane and Lydia are also particularly well portrayed as is Ms. Bingley whose jealousy and pettiness and attempts at manipulating Darcy and her brother are clearly displayed.Elizabeth Garvie's Lizzie is witty and playful, her demeanor in stark contrast to Darcy's haughty distant manner.Mr.Collins is absolutely delightful, portrayed in humorous manner, yet clearly showing his passive aggresive behavior towards Lizzie in the second part of the book.All in all you have to see this version if you are a true Austen fan. In my opinnion this version's main virtues reside in its subtlety and its fidelity to the original text, with wit and humour thrown in, just as intend by Austen's satirical portrayal of society at that time.I have found this version significantly better than the 1995 one whose two redeeming features are: 1. Colin Firth and 2. the locations.  The 1995 version is overtly romantic, which is probably why it is more of a crowd pleaser than the more subdued 1980 one, but it is not as faithful to Austen's work.I also really liked the 2005 version but although the characters were much better portrayed than in the 1995 version, the dialogue was modernized with elements that did not ring true to the original Austen text and the movie was made to be some kind of a Cinderella story with the Bennetts and the Darcys really far away on the social scale.My prefererences:1.

228820,A1MUP3BTU5XSAL,6300248569,Spider Wood,"[12, 14]","This production is more faithful to the book by Jane Austen than the others, both in character and plot.  It's also more comical and lighthearted than the other versions, but that's because it doesn't present any character as a cartoon or caricature (e.g., compare Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins here to their 1995 miniseries counterparts).  A caricature, to me, is like a lump of lead: throw it in water and it sinks.I find the relationships between the characters develop naturally.  The plain settings allow this development to come forth, like really good theatre.  Our reward is that we see the characters interacting in a world that has particular conventions.  Some of these conventions are difficult to explain to today's audiences, who get off on movies...like ""Titanic.""  Certainly, Fay Weldon crafted a couple of new scenes and there are some minor logical errors, but she's kept the dialogue, aired it out with discretion without twisting it.  Today's audiences tend to expect actors to show a good deal of emotion.  I think that Darcy's ""stiffness,"" as portrayed by David Rintoul, is right on key.  It's a function both of his pride and social standing, and makes for positive change as the series progresses.Elizabeth Garvie is very beautiful to look at as Elizabeth, but what sets her above other actresses in the role is her intelligence and curiosity about the world.  Her eyes are beautiful because they are open.  She is prejudiced against Darcy because he sleights her, he has contrived to separate Jane from Bingley, and is dislikeable, not because, for example, she is smugly superior to a likeable man.  Her discoveries of what a scoundrel Wickham is, and of Darcy's actions on behalf of her sister's honor, lead her (and the audience) to change judgment.Today's audiences tend to dislike her narration (but the book was originally narrated, no?) and to impose a modern standard of sex appeal.  (However, if there's a woman out there likeGarvie's Elizabeth, I'd certainly like to meet her...before I'm 35.)The other actors get into the meat of their parts, but I'll only recognize a few here.  Barbara Shelley is a warm and attractive Aunt Gardiner, the aunt you wish you had to warn you against evil.  Moray Watson is Mr. Bennet, a man of intelligence who suffers a wife-become-frivolous, and has a close bond with Elizabeth, despite being hemmed in by silly daughters.  Judy Parfitt is a pompous and caustic Lady de Bourgh ripe for shaking by Elizabeth at the end.  Sabina Franklyn (Jane) is beautiful and straightforward: though acquaintances of mine find her not voluptuous enough, I don't think that's a problem.The actress who plays Charlotte Lucas is plain, but not at all unhandsome and emphasizes the practicality of the character.The thing about pre-circa-1985 BBC dramas is you can watch them and imagine grand settings around the basic integrity of the characters and plot, without having so many bucks and pounds poured in for eye candy, or to do the work of the imagination.  And that's what reading the book is about anyway, coming up with one's own pictures.P.S.To the reviewer who would like to see the 5-part MichaelJayston and Sorcha Cusack ""Jane Eyre"" (1973) on DVD, I'll second that. The BBC hit a sweet spot in the 70s.  Any idea who owns the rights to distribute?  As the 1980 Pride and Prejudice went to DVD with stiff competition from the 1995 version, it doesn't seem impossible that Jayston/Cusack's ""Jane Eyre"" could go there too.",5,"Pride and Prejudice.

228821,A10PC6OX6CEHZV,6300248569,Steve W.,"[2, 2]","I've taken some time to read many of the reviews here.  I think it helpful to know something of the qualifications/limitations of a reviewer.  I'm a middle age, married man.  I like to read.  I like many types of books and movies.  I've been enjoying reading Jane Austen's novels these past few months, then researching the internet for favorite film versions of the stories.  I've only Northanger Abbey to finish now and I'll have read all six novels.  I've also purchased several dvd adaptations.  I'm not a scholar of Austen, and I certainly don't have profound insight.  But I think I read with fairly efficient comprehension. Reading her prose and syntax is very entertaining, but I believe it would be easy for careless readers to miss the subtlety if they don't pay attention.  I was constantly pulling out a dictionary, or re-reading entire sections.  And since I'm not from the England of 1800, the visualization of film makers is helpful to me to more clearly imagine the settings of the novels.Like many who have posted an opinion here, I enjoyed reading Pride and Prejudice.  I actually read it twice in a row a few months ago.  I'd seen the Greer Garson film adaptation a few times on Turner Classic Movies, and I very much enjoyed the BBC Jennifer Ehle version when I recently watched it after reading the book.  I purchased the BlueRay dvd.  I recommend it.  I agree that it is easy and fun to watch it repeatedly.  I've also seen the much later film starring Kiera Knightly, and I like it also.The older BBC Elizabeth Garvie version is available on Netflix, and I also found a dvd copy locally at a bookstore.  The picture and sound quality suffers in comparison to products of today's technology.  But the product isn't very expensive, and the viewing experience is pleasurable.  Many of these reviews for this serial version compare it to the later produced Jennifer Ehle serial.  For me, there's an unfairness about that since the principals involved with the Garvie version didn't have the advantage of seeing the later product.  So I watch this older series with a respect for its originality.  I like the adaptation very much, I like Ms. Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet and she matches closely what my mind's eye pictured her.  (I still remember when I was a younger man.  Ms. Garvie was a lovely young woman.)  I like the stage play quality which I take as intended.  That does give it a less ""film perfect"" aspect, but it doesn't bother me since I read the book more as a play than a reality.  There are many scenes in the book that would have been lit only by candle light.  This adaptation attempts to reproduce that effect, there are shadows across the faces sometimes.  Any criticism of lighting or production values is lost on me.My opinion is that the only relevant comparisons should be made to the original source material....the book.  Some characters/actors in this film are closer to what my reader's imagination envisioned than their counterparts in the later films.  Other characters are better represented in the later films.  As the saying goes, ""there's no accounting for taste in art"".  The five sisters in this version are attractive and look enough alike to believe they're related.  I like the portrayal of Mary particularly.  She isn't unattractive and she's more complex than assumed.  While pretending to be anti-social, she actually very much wants to participate and succeed socially.  I still haven't seen a Mr. Collins that reflects what I read.  In the book he is very young, like his cousins.  His youth is what gives his behavior as a suck-up to Lady de Bourgh much of the humor of his character.  He tries very hard to act older, and more important than he is, which Mr. Bennet especially enjoys.  The film actor for Mr. Collins seemed too old for my idea.  The actor who plays Kitty is attractive, but seems a little too old as well.  Jane Bennet was attractive, as required in the book plot.  I could agree with Mr. Darcy that she was the handsome woman at the assembly.  Mr. Bennet was correctly portrayed as something of a disappointment as a father to his daughters, and his marriage an example of the type of disappointment that Elizabeth and Jane wanted to avoid in their own lives.  Mrs. Bennet was written by Austen with a great deal of irony.  If you know that, you can find it in this film as well.There's a momentary scene where Miss Anne de Bourgh attempts to reach/connect with Elizabeth when they say their good-byes.  It's telling that she's a captive to her domineering mother, and would love to express herself as freely as Elizabeth is able.  I'm anxious to re-read the book to look for that theme.  If it isn't in the book, I still thought it added something of value to the play.  Like many of the others who have recorded their opinions here, I could go on with more.For me, two very important moments in the book are, one, when Elizabeth reads Darcy's letter and realizes how wrong she had been in her judgements of Darcy and Wickham.  How ""...I, who have valued myself on my abilities...Till this moment I never knew myself"".  This is included in the screen play.The second event I looked for, and I think my most noticeable impression was the lack of this scene, is where Elizabeth confesses that her feelings for Darcy began to change when she finally saw Pemberley.  The book scene is between Jane and Elizabeth after both their engagements are established and Jane is catching up on events unknown to her.  Superficially it seems unbecoming of Elizabeth to attach value to the wealth of Darcy's estate, etc.  But I read it as a watershed moment when Elizabeth began to understand the significance of what Mr. Darcy was offering her.  It wasn't just romance on the table.  Not only was she becoming aware that Darcy was an admirable man, but also he was offering her an inclusion in a generational continuity of benevolence that he'd inherited; and that he had to, and wanted to, respect.  This would be something she could justifiably be ""proud"" of.  I thought these were important elements in the book and I think Jane Austen thought so also.  Although there is a film scene where Elizabeth reflects on the many responsibilities that Darcy shoulders as the principal resident of his community, this last impact on Elizabeth (or at least the dialog from the book I was expecting) wasn't included in the film.Then again, what do I know?  It's strangely fun to read the book and get lost in it...even for an old man.  I need to re-read the book now that I've seen these several films.  I think there's a tendency to half remember dialog from the book, hear it again in a film, and then say the film was faithful to the book when it really wasn't the case.At any rate, I wanted to add my approval of this film to the data base here.  I understand a little of the passion of readers of Jane Austen, and their possessiveness of the story of Pride and Prejudice.  I assume that many fans are relatively young people.  I think many over-react to the film versions, but I admire their affection for the source material.  I don't have many problems with books adapted to film.  I finish by repeating my opinion that the comprehension that readers possess as a habit or skill (or their lack of it) is evident in reading some of their criticism archived here.  And comparing the BBC Jennifer Ehle adaptation (which is great but isn't always faithful the the book) to this older stage play film doesn't seem sensible to me.",4,lots of good things about this

It was obvious that the '95 version had a better budget as the costuming, locations, etc was much improved over this one. In this adaptation, the outfits Elizabeth wears look dowdy to me. Now, perhaps that was appropriate for the time, but I felt like it diminished her personality which was supposed to be lively and was a distraction for me as a viewer. The dancers seemed unsure of themselves and perhaps that is because that type of dancing probably was no longer well known and few knew how to perform it comfortably. They looked awkward.

Of course, the comparison doesn't help. The Ehle & Firth version has the advantage of being longer, fresher, and better cast. The energy in that one works; in this one it doesn't. It is, however, still preferable to the Keira Knightly version which was too modern, didn't grasp the difference between wit and immaturity and was so wrong on so many levels. I don't mean to say that this is absolutely terrible, it's just off. It seems to be either a problem in character interpretation or directing, maybe both.Elizabeth Garvie is so calm, vague, and restrained that she appears almost medicated. While she's still intelligent, there is very little evidence of wit or charm. She just drifts from scene to scene as a pale and almost emotionless abstraction of the real Elizabeth while saying all the right things.Darcy is supposed to be stiff, solemn, and not show emotion and, in that sense, David Rintoul got it right (particularly the 'stiff' part). Unfortunately, the vulnerability and shyness that lie beneath the public mask is never hinted at, there is very little difference between the Mr. Darcy at the beginning and at the end, and you never detect any spark or attraction or sensual tension between the two leads, even in the last scene where they are walking side by side. He resembled a man parodying fashion models in tight clothes walking down the runway.The main characters are not the only ones that suffer from either misinterpretation or misdirecting. Mr. Bennet is portrayed as more irresponsible and spoiled than in other versions rendering him much less likeable; the warmth between him and Lizzy is not portrayed successfully; and both Kitty and Georgiana appear to be a bit older than in the original. Even Pemberley is a bit of a disappointment.On the plus side, Mrs. Bennet is as flighty as ever but is portrayed a little more sympathetically. Jane, Lydia, Wickam, and the Bingley clan are very close to the original; Mary is as pedantic as usual but with a sweet smile; the costumes are attractive, and the photography is good when it isn't being even better.",3,Could have been better (and worse).,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,2204,"['think', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'loved', 'more', 'recent', 'BBC', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'one', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'course', 'comparison', ""n't"", 'help', 'Ehle', 'Firth', 'version', 'advantage', 'being', 'longer', 'fresher', 'better', 'cast', 'energy', 'one', 'one', ""n't"", 'however', 'still', 'preferable', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'version', 'was', 'too', 'modern', 'did', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'difference', 'wit', 'immaturity', 'was', 'so', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'say', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'just', 'off', 'be', 'either', 'problem', 'character', 'interpretation', 'directing', 'maybe', 'both.Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'so', 'calm', 'vague', 'restrained', 'almost', 'medicated', 'still', 'intelligent', 'very', 'little', 'evidence', 'wit', 'charm', 'just', 'drifts', 'scene', 'scene', 'pale', 'almost', 'emotionless', 'abstraction', 'real', 'Elizabeth', 'saying', 'right', 'things.Darcy', 'supposed', 'be', 'stiff', 'solemn', 'not', 'show', 'emotion', 'sense', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'got', 'right', 'particularly', ""'stiff"", 'part', 'Unfortunately', 'vulnerability', 'shyness', 'public', 'mask', 'never', 'hinted', 'very', 'little', 'difference', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'beginning', 'end', 'never', 'detect', 'spark', 'attraction', 'sensual', 'tension', 'two', 'leads', 'even', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'walking', 'side', 'side', 'resembled', 'man', 'parodying', 'fashion', 'models', 'tight', 'clothes', 'walking', 'down', 'runway.The', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'suffer', 'misinterpretation', 'misdirecting', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'portrayed', 'more', 'irresponsible', 'spoiled', 'other', 'versions', 'rendering', 'much', 'less', 'likeable', 'warmth', 'Lizzy', 'not', 'portrayed', 'successfully', 'Kitty', 'Georgiana', 'appear', 'be', 'bit', 'older', 'original', 'Even', 'Pemberley', 'bit', 'disappointment.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'as', 'flighty', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'little', 'more', 'sympathetically', 'Jane', 'Lydia', 'Wickam', 'Bingley', 'clan', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'original', 'Mary', 'as', 'pedantic', 'usual', 'sweet', 'smile', 'costumes', 'are', 'attractive', 'photography', 'good', 'when', ""n't"", 'being', 'even', 'better']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

I confess I couldn't, and so I found it mediocre at best.  I prefer my theatre experience in an actual theatre.  When it's captured on film, however, the whole experience just screams &quot;unrealistic&quot; to me.  Perhaps it's the lower budget of theatre productions relative to most film productions, I'm not exactly sure, but the first distracting element of this movie was the way it was captured on film.  It looked cheap (although it probably wasn't).  But I'm not that shallow.  :-)  If the acting was spectacular, I'd get over the cheap appearance.  Unfortunately, I didn't find a whole lot worth praising about the acting either.  I agree with most viewers that Mr. Darcy was portrayed so stiffly by David Rintoul that Darcy comes off like a jerk pretty much throughout the entire movie.  I also found Mr. Bennet in this production to be nothing like my perception of him from the book.  He didn't come off as clever, just mean-spirited and bitter.  I don't remember much about the other characters (translation: they're forgettable).  As for Elizabeth, other Amazon reviewers seem to love Elizabeth Garvie's portrayal of Elizabeth.  I thought she did a fine job, but not spectacular.  Of course, I freely admit A&amp;E's 1995 production of P&amp;P is my favorite movie EVER, so I am partial to Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of the character.  However, I don't think I unfairly penalized this film for not being A&amp;E's 1995 version.  I simply don't think there was anything utterly fantastic about this Masterpiece Theatre production.  It's decent and worth watching if you happen to stumble across it on PBS or something, but it's nothing I'd go out of my way to get.  It's simply not the kind of movie that sucks you in and forces you to care so much about it that you plan your kitchen and bathroom breaks around its commercials (or you put it on pause when you leave the room).

The sequence went like this: I saw the 1940 version many years ago, loved it. Then saw the 1996 version (loved it). Then a year or so ago I read the book (of course loved it). A month or so ago I ordered this BBC version and also the old 1940 version. I HATED the 1940 version after having been exposed to all the others, including the book. It bears little resemblance to Austen. In it, Mr. Darcy begins to fawn all over Eliza about halfway through, completely out of character. There are many scenes that are completely fictitious and thus unsatisfying. Anyway, back to this 1985 BBC production: after I got over the initial shock of the less posh production values, I grew more admiring of the spirit of Austen embodied in this version. It is definitely the closest to the book. Eliza is smart and spirited, more so than in the Firth version. Darcy is truly objectionable for most of the movie, and is not quite such a hunk as Firth. This movie doesn't resonate with the romantic promise that so captivated everyone about the Firth version. But it is immensely satisfying none the less. It presents Austen's vision much better- all the characters (with the possible exception of Jane, whom I thought was better portrayed in the 1996 version) are more complex and better represented- particularly the parents. There are several issues explained in this version that left me puzzled in the 1996 version (for example, the significance of Wickham &amp; Lydia not having gone to Scotland: only in Scotland could you get married immediately, not possible in England). I admit this is something of an obsession for me. I've compared the book line for line with the videos and this contains more of the original. Anyway, if you're mad about the A&amp;E version, I highly recommend that you get this one and watch it a couple of times- it will definitely fill out your Pride and Prejudice experience.",5,A MUST-SEE for Jane Austen fans......,973987200,"11 12, 2000",2000,2018,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'absolutely', 'rabid', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'production', 'own', 'have', 'watched', 'times', 'sequence', 'went', 'saw', '1940', 'version', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'loved', 'Then', 'saw', '1996', 'version', 'loved', 'Then', 'year', 'so', 'read', 'book', 'course', 'loved', 'month', 'so', 'ordered', 'BBC', 'version', 'also', 'old', '1940', 'version', 'HATED', '1940', 'version', 'having', 'been', 'exposed', 'others', 'including', 'book', 'little', 'resemblance', 'Austen', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'fawn', 'Eliza', 'halfway', 'completely', 'character', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'completely', 'fictitious', 'thus', 'unsatisfying', 'Anyway', 'back', '1985', 'BBC', 'production', 'got', 'initial', 'shock', 'less', 'posh', 'production', 'values', 'grew', 'more', 'admiring', 'spirit', 'Austen', 'embodied', 'version', 'definitely', 'closest', 'book', 'Eliza', 'smart', 'spirited', 'more', 'so', 'Firth', 'version', 'Darcy', 'truly', 'objectionable', 'most', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'such', 'hunk', 'Firth', 'movie', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'romantic', 'promise', 'so', 'captivated', 'everyone', 'Firth', 'version', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'none', 'less', 'Austen', 'vision', 'much', 'characters', 'possible', 'exception', 'Jane', 'whom', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'portrayed', '1996', 'version', 'are', 'more', 'complex', 'better', 'represented-', 'particularly', 'parents', 'are', 'several', 'issues', 'explained', 'version', 'left', 'puzzled', '1996', 'version', 'example', 'significance', 'Wickham', 'amp', 'Lydia', 'not', 'having', 'gone', 'Scotland', 'only', 'Scotland', 'could', 'get', 'married', 'immediately', 'not', 'possible', 'England', 'admit', 'something', 'obsession', ""'ve"", 'compared', 'book', 'line', 'line', 'videos', 'more', 'original', 'Anyway', ""'re"", 'mad', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'version', 'highly', 'recommend', 'get', 'one', 'watch', 'couple', 'times-', 'will', 'definitely', 'fill', 'out', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'experience']",Pride and Prejudice VHS
228830,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,6300248569,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[2, 2]","I'm not going to proclaim myself the ultimate Jane Austen fan (as I am not), I'm not going to tell you how many times I've read the book. Why would you care about that? The thing that I will say is that I cannot understand how so many people could find this version in any way accurate to Miss Austen's text, or even remotely resembles the rhythm and cadence of her words. Unfortunately, I'll have to use *MAJOR SPOILERS* to prove my point.I cannot find the atrocious proposal Charlotte Lucas in forced to endure in the second episode in the text, but that's a small matter. This is of course, an adaptation of literature, and as such, these liberties must sometimes be taken. But, I DO take issue with the fact that Elizabeth's refusal of Mr. Collins was absolutely *nothing* like the book! I also take issue with the fact that Charlotte Lucas brings the news of Mr. Bingley. I take EXTREME ISSUES with Elizabeth running like a hoyden through Lambton, to Pemberley! I take issue with the fact that the screenwriter clumsily mashed Miss Austen's sparkling prose and dialogue with overwrought wordiness that does nothing to highlight the greatness of the source material. In short, I don't find this version at all accurate! People say dialogue that didn't belong to them in the book, the events are sometimes out-of-sequence, and certain characters are trashed! Mary Bennett, a flirt, and wanting to dance with Mr. Darcy? Where did that come from? No, accuracy is not a virtue of this production.Still, all this might have been forgiven if the direction had been better. Yes, I know this is shot more like a filmed play than a movie. BUT I've seen plays before, even a very good production of Shakespeare, and I know it's possible to speak more complex English than Miss Austen wrote with naturalness and true feeling. I think the Director told every actor, ""speak as fast as possible, breath as little as possible, and make sure that you don't actually like anyone else.""As for the actors themselves... I'm sorry, they all either resemble paper dolls or wax statues. Not one of them gave even five honest, genuine moments of emotion! Elizabeth's ""fine eyes"" resembled a deer in the headlights. The actor who played Darcy had a face that couldn't move, a voice that rarely changed it's monotone, the most lifeless eyes I've ever seen, and he walked as if the costume designer had forced him into a corset. Granted, men did wear corsets as well as women in those days; but if he wasn't I can't account for his gate. I hope the poor man wasn't injured or something. As for the supporting cast, none of them impressed me with the sense that the cared about the characters they played at all.Again, I'm not claiming to be an Austen expert, but I can't help but wonder if she would recognize humanity in any of the way her characters were portrayed.",2,The March of the Paper Dolls,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,2844,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'proclaim', 'ultimate', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fan', 'am', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'Why', 'would', 'care', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'find', 'version', 'way', 'accurate', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'text', 'even', 'remotely', 'rhythm', 'cadence', 'words', 'Unfortunately', ""'ll"", 'have', 'use', '*MAJOR', 'SPOILERS*', 'prove', 'point.I', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'atrocious', 'proposal', 'Charlotte', 'Lucas', 'forced', 'endure', 'second', 'episode', 'text', 'small', 'matter', 'course', 'adaptation', 'literature', 'such', 'liberties', 'must', 'sometimes', 'be', 'taken', 'DO', 'take', 'issue', 'fact', 'Elizabeth', 'refusal', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'was', 'absolutely', '*nothing*', 'book', 'also', 'take', 'issue', 'fact', 'Charlotte', 'Lucas', 'news', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'take', 'EXTREME', 'ISSUES', 'Elizabeth', 'running', 'hoyden', 'Lambton', 'Pemberley', 'take', 'issue', 'fact', 'screenwriter', 'clumsily', 'mashed', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'sparkling', 'prose', 'dialogue', 'overwrought', 'wordiness', 'nothing', 'highlight', 'greatness', 'source', 'material', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'version', 'accurate', 'People', 'say', 'dialogue', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'book', 'events', 'are', 'sometimes', 'out-of-sequence', 'certain', 'characters', 'are', 'trashed', 'Mary', 'Bennett', 'flirt', 'wanting', 'dance', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'No', 'accuracy', 'not', 'virtue', 'production.Still', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'forgiven', 'direction', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'Yes', 'know', 'shot', 'more', 'filmed', 'play', 'movie', 'BUT', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plays', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'production', 'Shakespeare', 'know', 'possible', 'speak', 'more', 'complex', 'English', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'naturalness', 'true', 'feeling', 'think', 'Director', 'told', 'actor', 'speak', 'fast', 'possible', 'breath', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'anyone', 'else', 'actors', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'resemble', 'paper', 'dolls', 'wax', 'statues', 'Not', 'one', 'gave', 'even', 'five', 'honest', 'genuine', 'moments', 'emotion', 'Elizabeth', 'fine', 'eyes', 'resembled', 'deer', 'headlights', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Darcy', 'had', 'face', 'could', ""n't"", 'move', 'voice', 'rarely', 'changed', 'monotone', 'most', 'lifeless', 'eyes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'walked', 'costume', 'designer', 'had', 'forced', 'corset', 'Granted', 'men', 'did', 'wear', 'corsets', 'as', 'well', 'women', 'days', 'was', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'account', 'gate', 'hope', 'poor', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'injured', 'something', 'supporting', 'cast', 'none', 'impressed', 'sense', 'cared', 'characters', 'played', 'all.Again', ""'m"", 'not', 'claiming', 'be', 'Austen', 'expert', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'would', 'recognize', 'humanity', 'way', 'characters', 'were', 'portrayed']",Pride and Prejudice VHS
228831,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,6300248569,Wendy C. Rigney,"[23, 39]","I will start by saying that I had viewed the magnificent Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" before this particular version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul.  But I am usually a pretty open-minded person, so I figured I'd give this version a look, since I truly enjoy the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy from Jane Austen's terrific novel.It has been widely said that Elizabeth Garvie was a more compelling Elizabeth Bennet.  In this regard, though Ms. Garvie was quite capable in my eyes, her interpretation of Lizzie for me came across at times as almost...meek.  This is not complete bias to Ms. Ehle, whom I believe imbued Lizzie with fire and intellect, but something I merely felt did not ""translate"" properly with Ms. Garvie's Elizabeth (OK, maybe there is some bias.  But Ms. Garvie *does* have nice screen presence, as well.  It is merely different in nature.).  One scene in particular:  The proposal from Mr. Collins.  In the earlier version, Lizzie, it seems, is too gentle with Mr. Collins upon refusing his offer.  The words are right, but the mood is...off.  Contrast this to Ehle's portrayal -- I could see Elizabeth's chagrin, disdain, and reluctance in having to hear Mr. Collins' offer, and her offense when Mr. Collins implied that she was merely a silly female and playing hard to get.The supporting cast of this earlier adaption, right or wrong, did not seem to ""gel"" for me.  In terms of each character, I much pereferred Susannah Harker's Jane (1995).  Yes, perhaps Jane in the '80s version was conventionally prettier, but Ehle and Harker sold me on the sisterly affection they shared for each other, whereas I did not feel that in the earlier adaption.  For that matter, I also think Julia Sawalha's Lydia in the A&E; presentation was much more fleshed out as the officer-crazy, flighty girl she is supposed to be...and that helped to better set the foundation for her elopement with Wickham, since we're privy to her flighty, thoughtless nature.  I will easily admit that Mary, in this BBC version, does not seem as sour and had better characterization.  The later Mary seemed almost ashamed and resentful of her entire family.  Here, Mary is studious but not with too much ""bite"".  Since Kitty was so peripheral in both productions, it is a draw, but I think she was much more age-appropriate in the 1995 version and meshed well with her ""partner-in-crime"", Lydia.  Then we come to Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  I believe that Alison Steadham's portrayal in 1995 was a hoot...but Mrs. Bennet often seemed too over the top...very exaggerated.  I feel that her earlier portrayal rang more three-dimensional.  Yes, she was excitable and sometimes crass, but she did not seem overly so, as later portrayed.  But Mr. Bennet...I *much* preferred Benjamin Whitrow's interpretation in the A&E; version.  His character had the sarcasm, humor, and wit but without the caustic nature.  It seemed to me as if he almost despised everyone in his family in the 1980s BBC adaption -- including Elizabeth.  The later adaption, for me, showed a man put upon but with love for his girls (even if his favorite was clearly Lizzie -- just look at the final scene before the end of the A&E; version).  The rest of the supporting cast in both versions have their pluses and minuses.  For instance, Ms. Bingley did not come across as spiteful and cruel in the earlier version, but Mr. Collins is even more of a buffoon than portrayed in 1995.  It's all a matter of nuance, and what an individual prefers.  I find that though Garvie is charming, I much prefer Ehle's spicier Elizabeth.Finally, Mr. Darcy.  David Rintoul seemed like an adequate actor...but he did not do the part of Darcy justice.  Yes, Darcy was a proud and arrogant man.  But I feel he missed the hidden layers that were beneath the surface.  Most of poor Mr. Rintoul's scenes simply had him glaring at those around him.  His face never seemed to soften, and, even when he was supposed to be changing for the love of Elizabeth, he seemed much too...stiff.  (HERE, I can clearly admit to bias overwhelmingly in favor of the outstanding Colin Firth.  His Mr. Darcy was a chameleon, and we were privy to every change in mood and demeanor.  To be fair, however, Mr. Rintoul did not have the luxury of showing all that Darcy did for his sister and Elizabeth, as Firth did when going after Wickham and Lydia, for example.)  Most of all, I feel that Rintoul and Garvie, while pleasant to view, did not ""click"".  Firth/Ehle had a powerful, magical chemistry that immediately drew me into wanting their Darcy and Elizabeth to fight their obstacles and be together.  Again, however, this is neither wrong nor right, but a matter of personal preference.  Your mileage may vary.In essence, if you are a theater buff, this version may please you greatly.  The style of filming has an almost play-like quality to it, and the simplicity *does* offer a sort of charm for the BBC adaption.  Here, this is not a minus and would not be fair to deem it so because of the vast budgetary differences between the two.  However, if you're a viewer who enjoys intricacies of plot and depth, as well as first-rate aesthetics (costumes, dances, music, gorgeous scenery), I recommend spending a bit more on the A&E; adaption.  It's three-hundred (quick!) minutes very well spent and highly addicting.",2,Pales in comparison to the GREAT Firth/Ehle 1995 adaption,1020470400,"05 4, 2002",2002,5364,"['will', 'start', 'saying',

I highly reccomend that one.",3,Ok...I guess,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,339,"['movie', 'showing', 'one', 'most', 'loved', 'novels', 'time', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'storyline', 'good', 'so', 'are', 'characters', 'sound', 'color', 'were', ""n't"", 'fabulous', 'do', 'movie', 'think', 'little', 'outdated', 'newer', 'version', 'check', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '1996', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'one']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

It consists of five episodes and stars the engaging Elizabeth Garvie as Ms Elizabeth Bennet and the aristocratic-looking and handsome David Rintoul as Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.This was the first adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I watched, almost 16 years ago back when I was in college, and till today it remains one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's works, right up there with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. In fact, both Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul do a very credible job portraying the lead roles.Although Jennifer Ehle was charming and feisty in her role in the 1995 version, Elizabeth Garvie makes a spirited Elizabeth and a very attractive, bright woman. She delivers her lines with great spirit and I was utterly charmed by her performance. Her chemistry with Mr. Darcy was also very believable, from the early days of misunderstanding and tension to the gradual growing of affection between them. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as popular as Colin Firth's but he definitely brings a certain dignity and charm of his own to the role.As for the adaptation of the novel itself, the 1980 version is more faithful than the 1995 version, as it also contains about 75 extra minutes of dialogue that adds to the authentic feel of the adaptation. The rest of the casting in the 1980 adaptation was also well-done - Priscilla Morgan is hilarious as Mrs Bennet,Moray Watson is wonderful as the beleaguered Mr Bennet,Sabina Franklyn as the very beautiful and very nice Jane Bennet, Marsha Fitzalan made a very conniving Caroline Bingley and Judy Parfitt is perfect as the haughty and meddlesome Lady Catherine de Bourgh. However, I must admit that I preferred the 1995 casting with respect to the roles of Mr Collins [suitably oily], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.In Episode 2, Mr. Collins reveals his intentions during his visit, i.e. that he wishes to take one of the Bennet girls for a wife. Initially he targets the eldest Miss Bennet (Jane), but when Mrs. Bennet makes it clear that she is already 'taken', he shifts his attentions to poor Eliza Bennet, who clearly detests the presumptuous, overbearing man. There is so much comedy here to entertain, especially during the hilarious proposal scene, where Elizabeth tries her best to hide her revulsion and maintain her composure. The part where Mrs. Bennet insists on Mr. Bennet talking some sense into Elizabeth (into accepting Mr. Collins' proposal) and his reaction is worth a good laugh.What lets down this older adaptation though is the poor production quality - the lighting is too dull and scenes of dancing at the balls are very uninspired with cheap looking, very small sets that don't enhance the dramatization. It's a pity for with better production values, this could have been a stellar production given that it had a great screenplay and wonderful acting.On the whole, I find it hard to fault this adaptation. It will always remain one of my favorite adaptations, not just of Pride and Prejudice, but of Austen's works as it is very faithful and well-cast. I recommend this to all Austen fans and also those who have only watched the 1995 adaptation and the 2005 movie version starring Keira Knightley.",5,A dated but faithful and engaging adaptation,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3430,"['adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '1980', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'adapted', 'British', 'novelist', 'Fay', 'Weldon', 'very', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'five', 'episodes', 'engaging', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'Ms', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'aristocratic-looking', 'handsome', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'Mr', 'Fitzwilliam', 'Darcy.This', 'was', 'first', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'watched', 'almost', '16', 'years', 'ago', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'till', 'today', 'one', 'favorite', 'adaptations', 'Austen', 'works', 'right', 'up', 'there', '1995', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'starring', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'fact', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'do', 'very', 'credible', 'job', 'portraying', 'lead', 'roles.Although', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'was', 'charming', 'feisty', 'role', '1995', 'version', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'spirited', 'Elizabeth', 'very', 'attractive', 'bright', 'woman', 'lines', 'great', 'spirit', 'was', 'utterly', 'charmed', 'performance', 'chemistry', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'believable', 'early', 'days', 'misunderstanding', 'tension', 'gradual', 'growing', 'affection', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'Darcy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'popular', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'definitely', 'certain', 'dignity', 'charm', 'own', 'role.As', 'adaptation', 'novel', '1980', 'version', 'more', 'faithful', '1995', 'version', 'also', '75', 'extra', 'minutes', 'dialogue', 'authentic', 'feel', 'adaptation', 'rest', 'casting', '1980', 'adaptation', 'was', 'also', 'well-done', 'Priscilla', 'Morgan', 'hilarious', 'Mrs', 'Bennet', 'Moray', 'Watson', 'wonderful', 'beleaguered', 'Mr', 'Bennet', 'Sabina', 'Franklyn', 'very', 'beautiful', 'very', 'nice', 'Jane', 'Bennet', 'Marsha', 'Fitzalan', 'made', 'very', 'conniving', 'Caroline', 'Bingley', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'perfect', 'haughty', 'meddlesome', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'However', 'must', 'admit', 'preferred', '1995', 'casting', 'respect', 'roles', 'Mr', 'Collins', '[', 'suitably', 'oily', ']', 'Lydia', 'Bennet', 'Mr', 'Wickham.In', 'Episode', '2', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'intentions', 'visit', 'i.e', 'take', 'one', 'Bennet', 'girls', 'wife', 'Initially', 'eldest', 'Miss', 'Bennet', 'Jane', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'clear', 'already', ""'taken"", 'shifts', 'attentions', 'poor', 'Eliza', 'Bennet', 'who', 'clearly', 'presumptuous', 'overbearing', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'comedy', 'here', 'entertain', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'proposal', 'scene', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'best', 'hide', 'revulsion', 'maintain', 'composure', 'part', 'where', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'talking', 'sense', 'Elizabeth', 'accepting', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'proposal', 'reaction', 'good', 'laugh.What', 'down', 'older', 'adaptation', 'poor', 'production', 'quality', 'lighting', 'too', 'dull', 'scenes', 'dancing', 'balls', 'are', 'very', 'uninspired', 'cheap', 'looking', 'very', 'small', 'sets', 'do', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'dramatization', 'pity', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stellar', 'production', 'given', 'had', 'great', 'screenplay', 'wonderful', 'whole', 'find', 'hard', 'fault', 'adaptation', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'one', 'favorite', 'adaptations', 'not', 'just', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Austen', 'works', 'very', 'faithful', 'well-cast', 'recommend', 'Austen', 'fans', 'also', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'watched', '1995', 'adaptation', '2005', 'movie', 'version', 'starring', 'Keira', 'Knightley']",Pride and Prejudice VHS

Wonderful comic performances by the actors, creating humans, not cartoon characters. Difficult to do with these roles!  Several other supporting actors are good as well.But Lizzy.  Oh my.  She's terrible.  There's no wit, no sparkle, no chemistry with Darcy.  She competently pronounces her lines, but with little variation regardless of the context, or seeming understanding of the novel's subtext.  Darcy is a little better, but without a compelling Lizzy it hardly matters.The script and direction are truly poorly paced.  Important scenes are rushed over, and unimportant scenes drag on and on.  At times, additional dialogue not from the novel is thrown in for no apparent purpose other than to slow down a scene.The production values are typical 1980-ish British Television, so there's nothing visually arresting to distract you from the painfully tedious proceedings.I've enjoyed, in one way or another, every other adaptation of P&P; I've seen.
