The thing is Julia Ormond is totally not Audrey Hepburn and not even trying to be (good thing!). She did a good job. Harrison Ford I really disliked as Linnus, though I never totally liked Bogart's Linnus in the first place. Ford's Linnus was pretty good, but he just looked wrong! Ugh, I hated his glasses! This David wasn't as good as William Holden, who I thought was much smoother, but in the end I liked this David in his own right; he grew a bit, gained some character. I didn't like how he fell in love with Elizabeth Tyson (as in ""this is it, Linnus""-pretty real type of falling in love), instead of liking her and Linnus totally arranging the marriage. Because it made it way worse for David to go for Sabrina and fall in love with her so quickly; it makes him REALLY shallow (of course, he is shallow, but this brings it too far). Really liked how Sabrina's change is SOOO radical. I didn't recognize her at ALL! WOW.

397848,ANUN5B8HYZXEJ,6304044836,Alexander Arsov,"[5, 9]","Unfortunately, I have come to this movie only after seeing (several times) Billy Wilder's classic version from 1955, starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. In comparison, Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear, respectively, pale almost painfully. Julia is stilted and lifeless from the beginning to the end, having nowhere near the charm, grace and poise of Audrey; Harrison looks clumsy and awkward in both his serious and his comic scenes, and he - despite all my affection for him - is simply not in the same class as Boggie; and Greg may be said to be the greatest disappointment, as he cannot hold a candle to the vastly underrated William Holden.Nor do the changes in the script fare any better. The uproariously hillarious Larrabee father from the original movie is here completely omitted, while the role of the mother is unnecessarily expanded. Sabrina's Paris romance is as dull as anything and so are a number of other scenes, either lost in excessive sentimentality or artificially over/underacted. The scenes common to both movies are embarrassingly inferior in the remake. The latter, on the whole, attempts to be more serious than the original, but it only becomes a great deal less entertaining. Just compare the voice in the beginning that describes the Larrabee family and mansion: both the text and delivery are WAY superior in ""Sabrina"" (1955).I guess without the dubious benefit of comparison, the movie is not that bad, but it wouldn't get more than three stars even in this hypothetical case. If you have never seen the original version, I suppose this may be a fairly enjoyable way to spend two hours, although many scenes leave a good deal to be desired. But if you have seen Billy Wilder's gem, better be prepared that the remake, though basically the same story, is a different affair altogether. But if you haven't, unless you have some inherent dislike to old movies, I suggest you give Audrey, Boggie and William Holden a try. For my part, I wonder why Sidney Pollack and co. wanted to make this remake in the first place. They could hardly have won against such a rival and, for my part, I repeat, they lost rather badly.",2,Rather lame remake of a classic,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,2181,"['Unfortunately', 'have', 'come', 'movie', 'only', 'seeing', 'several', 'times', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'classic', 'version', '1955', 'starring', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'William', 'Holden', 'comparison', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'respectively', 'pale', 'almost', 'painfully', 'Julia', 'stilted', 'lifeless', 'beginning', 'end', 'having', 'nowhere', 'charm', 'grace', 'poise', 'Audrey', 'Harrison', 'clumsy', 'awkward', 'serious', 'comic', 'scenes', 'affection', 'simply', 'not', 'same', 'class', 'Boggie', 'Greg', 'may', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'greatest', 'disappointment', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'William', 'Holden.Nor', 'do', 'changes', 'script', 'fare', 'better', 'uproariously', 'hillarious', 'Larrabee', 'father', 'original', 'movie', 'here', 'completely', 'omitted', 'role', 'mother', 'unnecessarily', 'expanded', 'Sabrina', 'Paris', 'romance', 'as', 'dull', 'anything', 'so', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'scenes', 'lost', 'excessive', 'sentimentality', 'artificially', 'over/underacted', 'scenes', 'common', 'movies', 'are', 'embarrassingly', 'inferior', 'remake', 'latter', 'whole', 'attempts', 'be', 'more', 'serious', 'original', 'only', 'great', 'deal', 'less', 'entertaining', 'Just', 'compare', 'voice', 'beginning', 'Larrabee', 'family', 'mansion', 'text', 'delivery', 'are', 'WAY', 'superior', 'Sabrina', '1955', '.I', 'guess', 'dubious', 'benefit', 'comparison', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'even', 'hypothetical', 'case', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'version', 'suppose', 'may', 'be', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'many', 'scenes', 'leave', 'good', 'deal', 'be', 'desired', 'have', 'seen', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'gem', 'better', 'be', 'prepared', 'remake', 'basically', 'same', 'story', 'different', 'affair', 'altogether', 'have', ""n't"", 'have', 'inherent', 'dislike', 'old', 'movies', 'suggest', 'give', 'Audrey', 'Boggie', 'William', 'Holden', 'try', 'part', 'wonder', 'why', 'Sidney', 'Pollack', 'co.', 'wanted', 'make', 'remake', 'first', 'place', 'could', 'hardly', 'have', 'won', 'rival', 'part', 'repeat', 'lost', 'rather', 'badly']",Sabrina VHS

397850,A14N5L5T089VX3,6304044836,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[2, 2]","As one of those guys who admits to actually liking ""Chick Flicks"", the 1995 remake of ""Sabrina"", starring Harrison Ford, ranks as one of my favorites.In both the 1999 and 1954 releases of Sabrina, we have a no nonsense business tycoon, Linus Larrabee (Harrison Ford / Humphrey Borgart) who works tirelessly and ruthlessly to ensure nothing ever gets in the way of the growth of his business empire.  Linus learns of a developing affair between his irresponsible playboy brother David Larrabee (Greg Kinnear / William Holden) and the chauffeur's daughter (Julia Ormond / Audrey Hepburn).  Fearing the situation could interfere with his business plans, since David is engaged to the daughter of his business partner, Linus injects himself into the situation, with the intention of enticing Sabrina away from his brother.  His plan is to quietly entice her to Paris, from which she had recently arrived after a long absence - and then leave her there - making sure she would be comfortable and happy there, but no longer able to unwittingly interfere with his business plans.Of course, Sabrina is not the immature, impressionable young woman Linus expects, and he is soon caught in a web of his own making.The two versions of this story are vastly different in the details - in the 1954 release, Sabrina goes to cooking school in France.  In the 1995 version, Sabrina is an intern working at a high end fashion magazine.  Travel to Paris in the 1954 version is via ship, but is via the Concorde in the 1995 film.  It is very interesting seeing how cultural attitudes, particularly the role of women in society, changed in the course of the 40 or so years between the two releases.I saw the 1995 version first, then went back and rented the original.  Of the two, I found the 1995 version to be much more interesting and fun to watch.  (On the other hand, my parents, who saw the original version in its initial theatrical release, have the opposite opinion!)The supporting cast is great, delivering some of the best lines in the script - usually as very dry humor, often hysterically funny: Richard Crenna and Angie Dickenson deliver superb performances as the mother and father of David Larrabee's Fiance'.  The wonderful Nancy Marchand, in one of her last film roles, is perfect as the mother of Linus and David; and Dana Ivey delivers some really memorable zingers in her role as Linus's executive assistant.All in all, a sweet, movie sprinkled with witty, dry humor and a few hysterical sight gags: a good choice for a quiet evening in front of the TV with your significant other.If you like Sabrina, take a look atA Good Year (Widescreen Edition)starring Russell Crowe - though not quite on the same level as this film, it is a very similar sweet and funny story that is well worth watching.",5,Better the second time around,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,2793,"['one', 'guys', 'who', 'actually', 'liking', 'Chick', 'Flicks', '1995', 'remake', 'Sabrina', 'starring', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'one', 'favorites.In', '1999', '1954', 'releases', 'Sabrina', 'have', 'nonsense', 'business', 'tycoon', 'Linus', 'Larrabee', 'Harrison', 'Ford', '/', 'Humphrey', 'Borgart', 'who', 'tirelessly', 'ruthlessly', 'ensure', 'nothing', 'ever', 'way', 'growth', 'business', 'empire', 'Linus', 'developing', 'affair', 'irresponsible', 'playboy', 'brother', 'David', 'Larrabee', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', '/', 'William', 'Holden', 'chauffeur', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'Ormond', '/', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Fearing', 'situation', 'could', 'interfere', 'business', 'plans', 'David', 'engaged', 'daughter', 'business', 'partner', 'Linus', 'situation', 'intention', 'enticing', 'Sabrina', 'away', 'brother', 'plan', 'quietly', 'entice', 'Paris', 'had', 'recently', 'arrived', 'long', 'absence', 'then', 'leave', 'making', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'comfortable', 'happy', 'there', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'unwittingly', 'interfere', 'business', 'plans.Of', 'course', 'Sabrina', 'not', 'immature', 'impressionable', 'young', 'woman', 'Linus', 'soon', 'caught', 'web', 'own', 'making.The', 'two', 'versions', 'story', 'are', 'vastly', 'different', 'details', '1954', 'release', 'Sabrina', 'cooking', 'school', 'France', '1995', 'version', 'Sabrina', 'intern', 'working', 'high', 'end', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'Travel', 'Paris', '1954', 'version', 'ship', 'Concorde', '1995', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'how', 'cultural', 'attitudes', 'particularly', 'role', 'women', 'society', 'changed', 'course', '40', 'so', 'years', 'two', 'releases.I', 'saw', '1995', 'version', 'first', 'then', 'went', 'back', 'rented', 'original', 'two', 'found', '1995', 'version', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'fun', 'watch', 'other', 'hand', 'parents', 'who', 'saw', 'original', 'version', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'have', 'opposite', 'opinion', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'delivering', 'best', 'lines', 'script', 'usually', 'very', 'dry', 'humor', 'often', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'Angie', 'Dickenson', 'deliver', 'superb', 'performances', 'mother', 'father', 'David', 'Larrabee', 'Fiance', 'wonderful', 'Nancy', 'Marchand', 'one', 'last', 'film', 'roles', 'perfect', 'mother', 'Linus', 'David', 'Dana', 'Ivey', 'really', 'memorable', 'zingers', 'role', 'Linus', 'executive', 'assistant.All', 'sweet', 'movie', 'sprinkled', 'witty', 'dry', 'humor', 'few', 'hysterical', 'sight', 'gags', 'good', 'choice', 'quiet', 'evening', 'front', 'TV', 'significant', 'Sabrina', 'take', 'look', 'atA', 'Good', 'Year', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'starring', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'level', 'film', 'very', 'similar', 'sweet', 'funny', 'story', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Sabrina VHS

397868,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,6304044836,Charismatic Creature,"[12, 37]","This is a simply awful remake of the 1950s original with Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. Their roles are reprised by Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear.Of the three leads, Greg Kinnear (David Larrabee) does the best job. I think he is a very underrated actor, especially after his excellent work in &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;. He even slightly resembles a young William Holden.Harrison Ford does an adequate but uninspired job as Linus. Actually both Ford and Bogart were both too at least 20 years old to play Linus, who is supposed to be the older brother, not the father. This detracts a little from the romance, which is supposed to be May-September, not May-Decenber in character, but in the original film, Bogarts sheer charisma carried the day. Harrison Ford has many talents, but romance isn't one of them. He's a good performer in action flicks like &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; but he just has no chemistry here.The worst of the pack is Julia Ormond, an otherwise fine British actress (&quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot;). She is everything wrong for Sabrina -- I can only think they picked her for her smooth voice and accent, which do superficially resemble Ms. Hepburn's. But Julia Ormond is too old to play Sabrina (she was in her thirties when it was filmed and Sabrina is supposed to be about 20!) and doesn't come across as an ingenue. She is just plain painful in the early scenes, where the costume/makeup people went into overtime making her a frump with mounds of frizzy hair. Later, she is &quot;transformed&quot; with a short haircut but unlike Audrey Hepburn -- one woman who was utterly enchanting and beautiful with very very short hair, a hard look to carry off -- Julia looks just awful. It's an unflattering cut and served only to make her look even more mature, rather than sophisticated and charming.Much of the delightful, sparkling dialogue has been chopped out, towards what end I can't imagine. Also, instead of going to Paris and training as a chef (a very acceptable modern profession for a woman!), they have decided to make Sabrina a Vogue fashion photographer (despite no previous interest or background in photography OR fashion). Frankly, I think the writers were getting &quot;Sabrina&quot; mixed up with Audrey Hepburn's other great classic &quot;Funny Face&quot;, where she plays a frump-become-fashion-model. There is no other believable explanation! This also ruins her Paris experience, which was handled so delightfully in the original. If that isn't bad enough, they have innocent little Sabrina having a love affair, a point which terribly muddles the whole idea that she is a naive virgin pining for David. OK, frankly, not many girls stay virgins that long these days, but Sabrina had a reason for doing so and the additional lover (who is quite attractive) really skews the storyline off course.As a fashion buff, one of the great charms of the original film is the utterly exquisite, iconic fashions wore by Audrey Hepburn, who was not only one of the most beautiful actresses of her day but one of the most stylish women ever, period. (Both Edith Head and Herbert Givenchy designed her costumes.) Every outfit she wore in the original film is an absolute style classic. Some, like the dress she wears to the Larrabee's party after returning from Paris -- a white, strapless gown with black embroidery and a long swishy train -- are so absolutely breathtaking that the hairs on the back of your neck go up when you see her.In contrast, the remake &quot;Sabrina&quot; has some of the lamest, plainest costumes I have ever seen. In the identical scene (the party), Sabrina wears a drab, dark green evening dress. Not that Julia Ormond isn't attractive, but there is nothing dramatic or stunning about her appearance that would make every head turn when she enters...it's even more lame when other characters, like Mrs. Larrabee (the late Nancy Marchand, in her last role) make comments about how ravishing she is.Actually, while the filmmakers were &quot;updating&quot; Sabrina to be politically correct, I wonder why they didn't consider making Sabrina and her chaffeur father African American or Hispanic? Certainly that would reflect the reality in the 90s of what ethnic background servants to the very rich are likely to come from. (How often do you see a British chaffeur, really? Almost never! and why would Sabrina, who was raised in the US have a British accent anyways?) I think an interraccial romance would emphasize the cultural/economic differences between the Larrabees and the Fairchilds in a way that modern audiences could truly understand. BTW: I think Hallie Berry or Jennifer Lopez might have done very well in that kind of remake, and they each have a &quot;star&quot; quality that Ms.Ormond utterly lacks. Well, just my two cents.At any rate, this is a lifeless, tired and completely unnecessary remake. Do yourself a BIG favor and rent the original with Hepburn and Bogart and try to forget that this bloated remake was ever made.",1,Genuinely terrible remake of movie classic,1088467200,"06 29,

397873,A3N95R1VKWROWF,6304044836,Christopher Schwinger,"[0, 0]","If you haven't seen the 1954 movie this is a remake of, here's the basic story:  There are two brothers in the wealthy Larrabee family, one of whom is a playboy and the other of whom is a workaholic businessman.  The chauffeur's daughter, Sabrina, goes to Paris to learn a trade and comes back looking much more elegant.  The playboy is engaged to a woman from a wealthy family, which is supposed to strengthen the success of a business merger.  When Sabrina comes back from Paris, the playboy sets his desire on her, and so the businessman brother intervenes so the merger will not be ruined.  Eventually the businessman's heart softens and he stops being selfishly manipulative, and his own change causes the playboy to rise to the occasion and make things right.  It's all done with great flair and humor.I personally enjoy this version more than the 1954 original because Harrison Ford's character has more depth than Humphrey Bogart's.  Harrison Ford and Bogart both have deadpan humor which is funny in different ways, but the way Harrison Ford's character is written is more believable, as this version spends more time on the development of his relationship with Sabrina and his inner transformation.  I really like the writing for this 1995 remake.  It is filled with ambiguity between Ford's character and Sabrina about where their relationship is at, and both Ford's character and we the audience often don't know to what extent Ford is being manipulative and to what extent he's falling in love.  The conversations they have as their relationship develops are very well written.  I enjoy each way this remake movie changes things from the original, and I feel like the flavor is a little more realistic and a little less farcical than the original, which is part of why I prefer it over the original.  Mainly I love Harrison Ford as a leading man in a romantic comedy where he doesn't have to do action stuff.  He has a depth and sincerity, and the necessary deadpan humor, which are needed for this kind of part.  Someone with a more externalized charisma like Clark Gable or George Clooney couldn't do that kind of role, but Harrison Ford can, and I consider him one of my favorite present-day actors.",5,A remake which I like better than the original!

397874,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6304044836,Classic film buff,"[1, 1]","It takes an exceptionally brave director and actress to tackle a remake of one of Audrey Hepburn's most iconic roles as the title character in director Billy Wilder's 1954 film classic ""Sabrina"".  Although veteran director Sydney Pollock and neophyte actress Julia Ormond don't exactly cover themselves with glory, nonetheless they acquit themselves well with honor.The story begins on the Larrabee estate on the former Gold Coast of Long Island, NY.  Sabrina Fairchild, (Julia Ormond), is the very young, sheltered daughter of Fairchild (John Wood), the Larrabee family chauffeur.  The Larrabees are billionaires, with the family matriarch Maude Larrabee (Nancy Marchand), and the elder son Linus (Harrison Ford) focused on doubling the family fortune through their vast business empire, and younger son David (Greg Kinnear), a happy- go- lucky playboy intent on spending it.  Since childhood Sabrina has had a crush on David, but since she is shy and colorless, David never notices her.  On an apprenticeship to a chic fashion magazine in Paris, Sabrina finds herself and blossoms, returning home a lovely, self-assured young woman.  Her very first day back she catches David's eye, and dazzles him, quite the victory as she still cares deeply for him.  However, there is a slight hitch, David is engaged to Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), the daughter of the equally wealthy Patrick and Ingrid Tyson (Richard Crenna and Angie Dickenson).  Tyson has an exclusive new technology that Linus wants to acquire; this business collaboration will reap additional billions for both families and companies.  If David breaks off the engagement this lucrative deal will go right down the drain.  Linus, although he personally likes Sabrina, is not about to let her turn David's head.  When David is incapacitated by an embarrassing accident at his mother's birthday party, (he sits on a pair of champagne flutes, and he gets his butt stitched), Linus arranges a potent painkiller/sedative to keep David incommunicado and moves in to court Sabrina away from David.  Little does Linus realize he's playing with fire, and not only Sabrina but he as well may wind up being burned?Here's what works well in this remake over the original: First, the color photography, next the location shooting which has wonderful vistas of Paris, Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard and Long Island.  Being a former Long Island native I particularly appreciated settings I knew very well such as the Long Island Arboretum which was used for the Larrabee greenhouse, and it's back unused entrance that was turned into the entrance of the Larrabee estate.  My favorite though was the village street where Sabrina meets David upon her return from Paris, it was the main street of Huntington Village and many a Sunday in summer my parents would buy ice cream cones for my brothers and me as we strolled and windowshopped.  Eliminating the character of Mr. Larrabee Sr., who was a whiny nuisance in the original, was a wise choice as was building up and liberating the character of Maude Larrabee.  As played by Nancy Marchand she is a sharp, savvy executive who nonetheless deeply loves her sons.  Another plus is the wry, deadpan performance of Dana Ivey as Mack, Linus' executive secretary, or to be politically correct executive administrative assistant.  It's a small part, but she makes every line count. As Fairchild, Sabrina's father, John Wood had a warmer, more affectionate relationship with her than John Williams had in the original.  A nice touch I liked was giving Fairchild who's a widower, a romantic interest, Joanna, the Larrabee housekeeper played by another good character actress Elizabeth Franz.  A dreamy, elegiac theme song composed by John Williams and Alan and Marilyn Bergman entitled ""In the Moonlight"" is memorably rendered by Sting in his most persuasive manner.  Finally eliminating Sabrina's suicide attempt was a definite plus, I found it very distasteful and unnecessary in the original.To flip the coin, the Paris sequence is overlong, it should have been trimmed, and Sabrina's transformation from grub to butterfly dawdles along.  Her aborted romance with the French photographer goes nowhere and doesn't advance the plot.  Also, speaking of romance too much time is given to David and Elizabeth's; it gets in the way of the story.  Some judicious editing and tightening in these areas would have helped the film's pace and put more emphasis on the Sabrina/David/Linus triangle.Moving on to the Larrabee brothers, Harrison Ford is light years better than Humphrey Bogart, who seemed too irascible and world weary to pique the interest of the glowingly nubile Audrey Hepburn.  I could never believe she would pick him over William Holden who was younger, more handsome and charming than the dour Bogart.  Harrison Ford is much more appealing, though reserved and tradition bound, he's not ossified.  The viewer believes there is hope for him, as he starts to gradually thaw under Sabrina's charm, he reveals an inner confusion that becomes an appealing vulnerability when he begins to care for her.  Making his screen debut as David Greg Kinnear is a likeable rascal, boyishly handsome, with a quality of youthfulness that works for his character.Now as to Julia Ormond's Sabrina, the big question does she measure up to Audrey Hepburn's?  No she doesn't, but that shouldn't be held against her, Audrey Hepburn is irreplaceable.  On her own merits, not being compared with Ms. Hepburn's, her Sabrina is charming, a keenly intelligent Cinderella for the 1990's.  She's a lithe, elegant figure, comely with her tossed glossy curls and wide sparkling smile.  In short Ms. Ormond makes a most appealing romantic heroine just is lacking the stardust that made Ms. Hepburn unforgettable.Once when Sydney Pollack was hosting a Billy Wilder comedy on Turner Classic Movies, he made a self-deprecating comment to the effect about how hard it was to duplicate Wilder's master style, and he knew from his own experience.  I think Mr. Pollack sold himself and his movie short.  This is a guilty pleasure all dyed in the wool romantics should experience at least once.",4,"""I've been following in footsteps all my life; save me Sabrina Fair, you're the only one who

397881,A1MO0ZLZR1V3NN,6304044836,David Wilmot,"[4, 17]","The 1995 SABRINA was marketed as a remake of the 1954 Audrey Hepburn-Humphrey Bogart-William Holden film--adapted, of course, to modern sensibilities but not necessarily ""improved."" I'll confine my remarks to those parameters.Can you have a ""Cinderella story"" in a democracy? The original fairy tale and film were set in a world of strictly defined class and gender roles which the protagonists struggled to transcend. There is no snobbery in the world of the 1995 Larrabees--the fuddy-duddy senior Larrabee has been conveniently dispatched, the matriarch is a tough-talking old broad but good at heart, the chauffeur Fairchild (whom Bogart bemusedly called ""a terrible snob"" in the original) drove the elder Larrabee ""with the partition down"" for years but never improved his near-Cockney accent. There is really no death--Sabrina's suicide attempt (which viewers on this site found too gross) has been expunged.Nor is there cruelty. In the original, David/Holden is the younger brother gifted from birth with all the graces, which he uses to satisfy his yen of the moment with the assurance that someone will clean up after him. Sabrina/Hepburn goes to Paris a child (presumably fresh from high school; David speaks of her two years later as 22 but is probably boosting) and returns as glib and beautiful as David himself, fully aware of the harm she's about to do. The film is about her redemption by kissing the frog.The remake fudges all of this. The dance at the Larrabee home to which Sabrina gets herself invited the night of her return was originally a party celebrating David's engagement, at which his neglect of his fiancee for the stunningly gowned Sabrina upset both families, threatened the planned merger and prompted Linus's intervention at the tennis court. In the remake David's fiancee is in California for a medical conference, reducing the conflict to an ""I don't like the looks of this!"" on her father's part. Sabrina's grand entrance has been replaced by her slipping aboard unobtrusively as one more pretty girl; she's more Judy Garland than Princess Grace, confiding her fears to David's sympathetic Mickey Rooney.Going off to Paris for two years (to study cooking, Sabrina's late mother's calling, rather than ""find herself"") was tantamount to exile for working-class people in the Fifties (the middle class might manage an annual visit home.) Why Sabrina's benefactors sent her off to work for VOGUE in a klutzy hairdo and dirndl (she'd be perfect as the Village bookstore clerk in a remake of FUNNY FACE), and why she didn't get a trim till she came home, I can't imagine.Julia Ormond was most appealing in her smiling-through-tears scenes near the end, but I never really believed her conversion. David/Kinnear asked Linus/Ford the pivotal question after Linus had finished extolling the virtues of his beautiful, intelligent, socially committed fiancee--""Why don't YOU marry her? DON'T ANSWER THAT!"" The answer is, of course, that all the problems would have been solved and there would have been no SABRINA 1995.",1,The very rich are no different from you and me.,1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,3044,"['1995', 'SABRINA', 'was', 'marketed', 'remake', '1954', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn-Humphrey', 'Bogart-William', 'Holden', 'film', 'adapted', 'course', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'not', 'necessarily', 'improved', ""'ll"", 'confine', 'remarks', 'parameters.Can', 'have', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'democracy', 'original', 'fairy', 'tale', 'film', 'were', 'set', 'world', 'strictly', 'defined', 'class', 'gender', 'roles', 'protagonists', 'struggled', 'transcend', 'snobbery', 'world', '1995', 'Larrabees', 'fuddy-duddy', 'senior', 'Larrabee', 'been', 'conveniently', 'dispatched', 'matriarch', 'tough-talking', 'old', 'broad', 'good', 'heart', 'chauffeur', 'Fairchild', 'whom', 'Bogart', 'bemusedly', 'called', 'terrible', 'snob', 'original', 'drove', 'elder', 'Larrabee', 'partition', 'down', 'years', 'never', 'improved', 'near-Cockney', 'accent', 'really', 'death', 'Sabrina', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'site', 'found', 'too', 'gross', 'been', 'expunged.Nor', 'there', 'cruelty', 'original', 'David/Holden', 'younger', 'brother', 'gifted', 'birth', 'graces', 'satisfy', 'yen', 'moment', 'assurance', 'someone', 'will', 'clean', 'up', 'Sabrina/Hepburn', 'Paris', 'child', 'presumably', 'fresh', 'high', 'school', 'David', 'speaks', 'two', 'years', 'later', '22', 'probably', 'boosting', 'returns', 'glib', 'beautiful', 'David', 'fully', 'aware', 'harm', 'do', 'film', 'redemption', 'kissing', 'frog.The', 'remake', 'fudges', 'dance', 'Larrabee', 'home', 'Sabrina', 'invited', 'night', 'return', 'was', 'originally', 'party', 'celebrating', 'David', 'engagement', 'neglect', 'fiancee', 'stunningly', 'gowned', 'Sabrina', 'upset', 'families', 'threatened', 'planned', 'merger', 'prompted', 'Linus', 'intervention', 'tennis', 'court', 'remake', 'David', 'fiancee', 'California', 'medical', 'conference', 'reducing', 'conflict', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'looks', 'father', 'part', 'Sabrina', 'grand', 'entrance', 'been', 'replaced', 'slipping', 'aboard', 'unobtrusively', 'one', 'more', 'pretty', 'girl', 'more', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Princess', 'Grace', 'confiding', 'fears', 'David', 'sympathetic', 'Mickey', 'Rooney.Going', 'Paris', 'two', 'years', 'study', 'cooking', 'Sabrina', 'late', 'mother', 'calling', 'rather', 'find', 'was', 'tantamount', 'exile', 'working-class', 'people', 'Fifties', 'middle', 'class', 'might', 'manage', 'annual', 'visit', 'home', 'Why', 'Sabrina', 'benefactors', 'sent', 'off', 'work', 'VOGUE', 'klutzy', 'hairdo', 'dirndl', ""'d"", 'be', 'perfect', 'Village', 'bookstore', 'clerk', 'remake', 'FUNNY', 'FACE', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'trim', 'till', 'came', 'home', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine.Julia', 'Ormond', 'was', 'most', 'appealing', 'smiling-through-tears', 'scenes', 'end', 'never', 'really', 'believed', 'conversion', 'David/Kinnear', 'asked', 'Linus/Ford', 'pivotal', 'question', 'Linus', 'had', 'finished', 'extolling', 'virtues', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'socially', 'committed', 'fiancee', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'YOU', 'marry', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'ANSWER', 'answer', 'course', 'problems', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'solved', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'SABRINA', '1995']",Sabrina VHS

397883,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6304044836,Deborah Earle,"[4, 5]","Julia Ormond was well-chosen to fill Audrey Hepburn's shoes in the title role. Compared to the 1954 original, this 1995 version has a fresher, more fast-paced, less archaic look to it, and a cast of more assertive females who are accomplished women in their own right rather than just clinging-vine rich girls who are determined to marry well. The suicide attempt of the title character is happily, left out of this version.Fanny Ardant is warm and personable as the Vogue Magazine editor who takes Sabrina under her wing after her arrival in Paris. The temptation to have sex with a co-worker to ease her lonliness in response to her learning about David Larrabee's engagement is tasefully and honorably dealt with by Patrick Bruel's character, Louis, and the scenes of Paris are sheer delight. The original ""Sabrina"" introduced me to the beautiful song, "" La Vie en Rose"", which gets a little air time in this version as well.John Wood has a firmness about him mixed with paternal warmth as he worries about the daughter he has raised by himself. Elizabeth Franz is endearing as his potential love interest. The late Nancy Marchand plays a matriarch who knows how to put her foot down concerning her less-reliable younger son, David.As David, Greg Kinnear is less oily, less sleazy, and somehow, less irritating than William Holden was in the 1954 original. Interestingly, it is mentioned in this remake that David has been in and out of several relationships, but not several marriages, as was the case when William Holden had the part. Perhaps it's because we live in an era where a considerable number of women are less naive and more likely to avoid someone with such a bad marital track record. But we are thankfully spared the details of how far David goes in his relationships.A rugged-looking Harrison Ford gives a performance that is more than faintly reminiscent of Bogart's when the latter played Linus Larrabee in the original. He is the responsible, brilliantly scholastic brother that any woman who thinks of marrying should want to marry. But he's always busy. One of the most poignant scenes in the whole film is when he admits his lonliness to Sabrina during a business trip to Cape Cod. But his growing desire to impress the woman he has known since childhood with his softer side results in his doing an admirable act of charity along the way. Linus really lights up and lightens up in Sabrina's presence.Ormond's performance is filled with delicate nuances as she goes from an obsessive, mousy girl to a sophisticated woman. Her make-up job and tastes in clothing after she returns from Paris are beautiful, suitable, and very refined.Miriam Colon has great comic timing as the Spanish maid, Rosa. Her story about immigrating to the United States, told in response to learning about the adjustment problems Sabrina was having in France, is one with which anyone who has constantly had to move could easily identify. Dana Ivey is equally witty as Linus' prim secretary.Richard Crenna and Angie Dickenson as David's future in-laws are sharp, offbeat, and engaging, as is Lauren Holly as David's admirably accomplished pediatrician fiancee.Amid breathtaking, sharp cinematography, and a subtle,elegant musical score, the principals in this drama make some crucial, life-altering decisions. My copy of this film, interestingly enough, is smack in the middle of two other films which end with the male lead asking a woman to take him back, namely, "" Forever Young"", and "" Circle of Friends"".

I went to a movie theater to see this one when it first came out and laughed out loud.  Sydney Pollack is one of my favorite directors of all time (and he was an amazing actor, as well). Julia Ormond was so stunning----I couldn't take my eyes off her gorgeous face with that lovely sunshine smile.  She looked ravishing in the green gown she wore for the party.  Greg Kinnear, in his first movie role, was so fresh and delightful, playing the wishy-washy, sometimes really goofy, David Larrabee.  Harrison Ford...... well what can be said of Harrison Ford that hasn't been said a thousand times over?  He plays Linus as a droll, sharp, and almost jaded business man.....until he finds himself drowning in love for Sabrina. I have always loved Nancy Marchand---such a great actress in drama or comedy.  I almost died from laughter when, at the party she verbally dresses down both her sons. Standing there, in that ridiculous pink evening gown with the gi-normous BOW, she so seriously asks the angry question, ""Do I look stupid?""  I was on the floor with laughter!!  Another extremely funny actress is Dana Ivey, who can spit out lines with biting sarcasm like no other. She was a scream in this one, playing Linus's secretary, Mack. Ms. Ivey's character seemed to have a better grip on the reality of the foibles of this dysfunctional family without a hint of anything but love for them.  Mack had some of the best lines in the movie.  Add to the cast Richard Crenna, Angie Dickinson, and Lauren Holly and you've got yourself a fun evening!!  The 1954 version was very cool and breezy.

397886,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6304044836,Dennis Littrell,"[106, 111]","I was surprised at how good this movie is.  A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, directed by one of the greats of American cinema, Billy Wilder, is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart.  The fact that Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses Don't They? (1969), Tootsie (1982), Out of Africa (1985), etc.) decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.And let's just say I had preconceptions as I sat down to watch this.  No way could this be anything near as good as the original.  And for the first twenty minutes or so I was not dissuaded.  Julia Ormond, who was given Miss Hepburn's title role, seemed nothing far removed from ordinary; and Greg Kinnear, who played the playboy David Larrabee, seemed a poor imitation of William Holden.  Of course Harrison Ford, I told myself, is another story, since he is the embodiment of the fulfillment of the desire of many woman, and a fine, accomplished leading man.  He would be, I suspected, the lone bright spot.  In the original, Humphrey Bogart, a little past his prime, and in not exactly the best of moods, and not entirely pleased with the relatively inexperienced Audrey Hepburn, played the cool tycoon Linus Larrabee with some distracted forbearance in what many consider one of his lesser performances.  Surely Harrison Ford could improve on that.He did, but what really surprised me was just how diabolically clever the oh, so romantic script by Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel turned out to be.  I mean, Cinderella move over.  Sabrina could not have achieved a more glorious existence had she died and gone to heaven.  It is hard to imagine a more fulfilling fantasy for a chauffeur's daughter than what transpires here.Quickly here's the premise of this celluloid fairy tale/romance: Pretty but ordinary Sabrina, born of working class parents, her father the chauffeur of the ultra rich Larrabees, grows up living above the garage in the palatial Larrabee estate.  She watches the lavish parties thrown by the Larrabees from a spot in a tree and falls madly in the kind of puppy love that never goes away with the younger of the Larrabee brothers, David, who is the kind of guy who gives playboys a bad name.  When she comes of age, she goes away to Paris (apparently to work for a fashion magazine: in the original Sabrina, she goes to a cooking school in Paris), picks up confidence and a new kind of eye-popping sophistication, comes back and...well, gets noticed.The basic skeleton of this, the story from the first Sabrina (1954), which is dreamily romantic enough and then some, is greatly augmented here with some very fine psychological touches including developing Sabrina's character beyond the pretty and stylish to something bordering on the wise and heroic.  Suffice it to say that we come away feeling she deserves every rainbow's end she gets.  I can see Benedek and Rayfiel exclaiming with riotous joy as they are writing the script (trading e-mails perhaps): ""They want romance, they want woman's fantasy?  They want Sabrina to have a pot of gold and true love everlasting?  How about riches beyond counting and the doting attention of the two handsome, very rich brothers?  She can take her pick.  We've give 'em romance, we'll give 'em dreams come true!""  And they do.  Not only that, but they keep us guessing about who gets the girl until the last possible moment, and they do that very cleverly.Of course it helps to have professional direction by Sydney Pollack and a fine cast including Harrison Ford--at his best, by the way--and Julia Ormond, a hard-working and talented actress (I recall her from Smilla's Sense of Snow, 1997), who knows how to be cute without fawning, supported by Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood and Angie Dickinson.  I mention Miss Dickinson because, as the mother of a perspective bride about to throw an incredibly lavish wedding, she gets to deliver this ""let them eat cake"" line: ""We thought we'd use recycled paper"" (for the wedding invitations).The script is full of similar witticisms, some verbal, some like eye candy.  For example, when Sabrina removes her glasses (the usual Hollywood signal for the adolescent ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan) after gaining sophistication in Paris, she quotes aptly but surprisingly from Gertrude Stein: ""America is my country and Paris is my home.""  (Of course Gertrude Stein never heard of Paris, Texas--but that is another film, and besides, I digress...)I also liked it when Sabrina is in the arms of her Paris would-be lover who kisses her, and--noticing that she is not as engaged as she might me-observes with perfect decorum, ""I'm embarrassed that you're somewhere else.""Memorable was the shot of Harrison Ford momentarily looking jealous and hurt.  By the way, he has a number of good lines, and he delivers them well.  I especially liked it when he sadly confessed: ""I was sent to deal with you.  I sent myself.""It is probably better if you haven't seen the original and can experience this on its own merits without the odiousness that sometimes comes with comparisons.  Comparing Audrey Hepburn with Julia Ormond is like comparing Grace Kelly with Jennifer Lopez.  They really are very different people.  And comparing Billy Wilder's 1954 film (from the play by Samuel Taylor) is a little like comparing Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera with Andrew Lloyd Webber's.Bottom line: see this for both Harrison Ford who wears the business-first character of the ""only surviving heart donor"" very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",5,Cinderella has nothing on her,1040083200,"12 17, 2002",2002,5760,"['was', 'surprised',

I agree with the reviewer who said that julia ormond should be the actress for ""The Audrey Hepburn Story"" which I would not recommend anyone to see, not Jennifer Love Hewitt. I checked out other Julia Ormond films, investing in the purchase of Smilla's Sense of Snow, Legends of the Fall, Nostradamus and have always found that a rewatch of Ormond's Sabrina was a better use of time than watching her other films. I have always wondered why Julia Ormond made so few films and so little is known of her. I would have liked to see more of her in films where an audrey hepburn calibre actress was called for. incidentally, audrey was hepburn's film name.

An amazingly strong cast graces this light-hearted romantic comedy that also has a wonderful soundtrack.  The  music truly adds another sweeping dimension to the film.  Julia Ormond is  stunning yet sweet as Sabrina, and her transformation from the dowdy,  lovelorn adolescent to glamorous sophisticate was very well done.  Her  quiet, smooth voice opens the movie and flows over tranquil scenes of the  luxurious Larrabee estate, Harrison Ford is the stoic Linus Larrabee the  cold, sharp businessman (&quot;the world's only living heart-donor&quot;)  who learns to love under the gentle guidance of a mature and wise Sabrina.  Greg Kinnear is an extremely likable David, the younger son.  Nancy  Marchand is a hoot as Maude, the matriarch, who dons some rather elaborate  evening gowns!  John Wood is a most distinguished chauffeur, and audiences  will respect him more than the original.  Even Mac, the loyal, ever so  efficient secretary, has some great one-liners.The original made me  squirm with Hepburn's portrayal of an embarrassingly  immature, unbalanced  Sabrina.  The remake stresses her psychological maturing (&quot;I found  myself in Paris&quot;) in addition to the physical makeover.  More  importantly, Bogart and Hepburn didn't give me the same thrill that Ford  and Ormond do.  I think they really enjoyed making this movie together -  their shared smiles and laughter on Martha's Vineyard and in the Moroccan  restaurant seemed genuine.  It's more than good acting.

I didn't see it until it came on TV. After all, the original Sabrina has been one of my favorites since my early teens (over 40 years ago). When I finally did see it, I enjoyed it because it was pretty much an entirely different story. The original story line was nicely updated to modern times when the age difference of 20s to 40s isn't as drastic as it was back when the original was made. Also, the heroine has a career (photography) in the modern version, unlike being daughter of 'the Help' with no expectations other than becoming the 'Help' herself and marrying another member of the Help. Even the playboy brother isn't as much a stereotype. I like the change of useless debutante fiancee' of the brother into a career woman in the updated version. This is a nice movie. It doesn't have the romance of the original and will never replace the original in the minds and hearts of lovers of the original Sabrina but it is a worthy movie in it's own right and shouldn't be compared to the incomparable movie that the original is.

397945,AL4MKKO24563R,6304044836,Michael K. Beusch,"[7, 14]","The original Sabrina was a classic, with three of the greatest stars of all time -- Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden -- being directed by Billy Wilder, one of the greatest directors of all time. To be sure, the producers of this remake did their best to duplicate the magic of the first film. It's directed by the great Sydney Pollack and stars Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood, Richard Crenna, Angie Dickinson and Lauren Holly. In one way, the film is better for the casting of Harrison Ford in place of Humphrey Bogart. Ford probably wasn't much younger than Bogart was when he made his version. But Bogart seemed older than the 54 he was when the original was made. Ford, in contrast, seems much more youthful ( even with Linus Larabee's stuffy persona) and more of a natural match for Sabrina.However, all of these quality elements are negated by the casting of Julia Ormond as Sabrina Fairchild. To be sure, Ormond is a beautiful woman. However, she has the charisma of a pile of wet toilet paper. She has absolutely none of the allure of her predecessor in the role and comes off very, very badly because of it. I know it's unfair to compare most actresses with the irreplaceable Audrey Hepburn, but this, after all, is the role she created, so she is being held to a higher standard. I knew there was a problem with the movie when I found myself more attracted to Lauren Holly as Greg Kinnear's jilted fiancee than Julia Ormond as the lead. Because of this bad casting, the film just falls flat and pales in comparison to the original.

Although, a merger by marriage is not out of the question.Linus (Harrison Ford) is the responsible older brother, David (Greg Kinnear) is his irresponsible younger brother, Maude (Nancy Marchand) is the matriarch of the family.  Their trusted chauffer Fairchild (John Wood) has a gawky teenage daughter Sabrina (Julia Ormand).  Sabrina has a fantasy crush on David.  Fairchild sends Sabrina to Paris to finish her and make her forget David.Eventually, she returns home, a much more polished woman.  Upon her return, she runs into David who invites her to a party (not knowing she's the chauffeur's daughter.)  David is falling for Sabrina and this does not please Linus (David is to marry Elizabeth Tyson to assure the merger.)  Linus steps in and parts Sabrina and David.  This works a little too well.This is a remake of a classic Billy Wilder film.  I will state now that the original is a near perfect film with a perfect cast, Bogart, Holden and Audrey.  But this is a fun romance with its own fine cast.Harrison Ford is excellent as Linus and shows that not only can he be romantic but funny.  This was Greg Kinnear's film debut and proved his likeability and charm (similar to Holden who was the proverbial second lead at the time the original came out).

When the poor chauffeur's daughter gets a chance to go away to Paris to work on ""Vogue"" magazine, she comes back transformed.Meanwhile, David's engaged now to a young doctor, Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly) whose family is also an excellent match for the Larrabees. The Tyson family owns a patent that eldest son Linus (Harrison Ford) needs for his multi-billion dollar business.  He's working to merge their two companies together.When David sees Sabrina, his typical short attention span kicks in, which wreaks havoc with the Tysons.  Linus steps in to divert David.  When he tries to romance Sabrina to get her away from David, Linus realizes the chauffeur's daughter could be the girl for him.Probably only Sydney Pollack could direct a film that would come close to the original, which starred Humphrey Bogart as Linus and Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina.  The modernization of the story is fascinating.  Harrison Ford makes as good a Linus as Bogart.  Ormond is exquisite, but she doesn't quite live up to the luminous quality of Audrey Hepburn.

397962,A25BYNY3CLEJ3G,6304044836,Rob Chang,"[35, 41]","I don't care what anyone says; there's no need to compare 1995's Sabrina to the Audrey Hepburn classic. This one, in my opinion, is clearly superior than the original.By default, film as an art form has evolved and matured far beyond where it was almost half a century ago. Unless the original was of undeniable achievement in every aspect from technical to artistic (which the original Sabrina wasn't, if we are being honest), the remake will usually be more refined due to the natural evolution of film making techniques, storytelling, and more sophisticated sensibility. Side by side, the 1995 SABRINA is more clever in dialogue, plot, and direction. Let's not get into how the Hepburn version is better simply because it's the original, or a legendary actress was in it. Remakes aren't inherently inferior, and Julia Ormond is an actress that commands respect, as her acting career has demonstrated. On top of that, Harrison and Greg made much more charming and convincing Linus and David than the original cast.Another touch that made it better was changing Sabrina's Paris trip to becoming a photographer instead of a cook. It gave her so much more confidence and validated her as an individual who's accomplished in artistic achievement, and the artistic endeavor matched her sentimental personality far better.It was  also a great move to have Linus truly be the head of the family by taking out the father. That way, Linus became even more of a figure to be intimidated by, and the weight on his shoulders seemed that much heavier.The original Sabrina didn't do a very good job at convincing us why Linus should fall in love with Sabrina.

Messenger,"[1, 2]","Now I admit, I am very biased with this movie because my mother named me after the 1st film, so for me to be a fan of this movie is something of a no-brainer. I own both versions, and I really think each movie should be judged by its own merits. However, if I have to choose which I favor, it would have to be the 1995 re-make because I feel that it speaks more to my generation that the earlier version.Of course, Humphrey Bogart is the strong, silent type, and Audrey Hepburn is the epitome of elegance, and they played their roles in a way that was accurate and appropriate for 1954, but let's face it, Audrey's sort of elegance for many today is somewhat unattainable. I liked the way Julia Ormond interpreted Sabrina because while she is played as savvy, she is still somewhat vulnerable, and not afraid to be so. I also liked the way she brings out the vulnerability and tenderness in Linus ""the world's only living heart donor"" as played by Harrison Ford.A few other reasons why I appreciate the remake?The various characters were better developed in the 2d movie. In the original it was as though they were blending in with the furniture. Linus's admin just cracked me up with her dry humor. The mother was pretty funny at points, too. I also liked the fact that Elizabeth Tyson is played up more intelligently in the re-make than in the original...and that despite the temptation in the end, David honors his commitment to Elizabeth in the end. About the only ""airhead"" was the Angie Dickenson character, but even that role was humorous. I cracked up watching her be all flirty with Linus at the dinner.Recently, I had a chance to read the entire script from the original 1953 Samuel Taylor play entitled Sabrina Fair: A Woman Of The World. I discovered that the 1995 movie is actually closer to the script of the play than the 1954 movie.  In the original movie, there's no mention of the fact that Fairchild, the chauffer having become a millionaire over the years by listening into Larabee Sr.'s transactions, but the play and the remake do mention it. I feel that part is essential to the story as part of the issue in both movies was class distinction...albeit moreso in the former than in the latter.My only complaint? I used to have this movie in VHS, and that version included a video of Sting singing the song ""Moonlight.""

She later spends a few years in Paris, and upon her return home, she is transformed into a sensual, sophisticated woman. Unknowingly, David picks her up after she was seen hitchhiking (albeit with a different appearance), and slowly begins to fall for her. They both seem to get the chance to have what they (or rather Sabrina) wanted a few years back.And here is where the story takes a few twists. David's older, wiser, and seemingly callous businessman brother Linus (played by Harrison Ford) notices the sparks between David and Sabrina, and immediately concocts a scheme to break them apart. The reason for this is because the business of which Linus is involved, was going to reach an agreement for a nice business deal involving the parents of David's then-fianc&eacute;e, Liz (played by Lauren Holly), but soon realizes if David falls for Sabrina, then he'll no longer have much interest in Liz, and therefore, the deal would be jeopardized. So, Linus takes it upon himself to try his best to get Sabrina out of the picture. He goes to low lengths in trying to keep David and Sabrina apart - one of them is the darkly hilarious scheme which involved keeping David on heavy sedatives, which were really intended to be minor painkillers due to an unfortunate accident involving drinking glasses. These would keep him bed-ridden and disoriented. Inbetween all of this, Linus manipulates Sabrina by trying to pass himself off as a subtly charming and romantic guy, which in return gains her affections. But, something goes haywire in the scheme -- Linus starts to fall in love with her.It must be mentioned that the ending scene (the one before Linus flies off to Paris to find Sabrina) was quite clever, spellbindingly &amp; inexplicably funny, but in a subtle, classy, European manner. Doesn't seem like the kind of thing you see in many films, especially in the romantic heading.As of yet, I haven't seen the original version of this starring Audrey Hepburn, so I won't bother making any comparisons. The story is quite charming, and features a nice amalgamation of humor, wit, romance and intelligence. The performances were all well-done, and Julia Ormond was quite lovable as the perceptive, innocent, elegant and vulnerable Sabrina. Harrison Ford gave a nice performance as the cold, scheming, lackadaisical-in-temperament Linus, which really doesn't seem like much of a stretch for him (the temperament part anyway), and Greg Kinnear as always is charming and charismatic. Also features Hollywood legend Angie Dickinson. An enjoyable, sophisticated romantic film.

397973,A1T4IVIH6NUEXF,6304044836,sand-da-man,"[5, 15]","Sydney Pollack says that he was reluctant to direct this movie, a remake of the version with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, but was finally coaxed into it by Harrison Ford. He had to be disappointed with the result, however, for the resulting comparisons were inevitable. The story stays with the essentials: two brothers-  Ford, the older one, a serious and successful businessman; the other, the irresponsible, handsome playboy played by Greg Kinnear-  vying for the affections of the chaffeur's daughter, Julia Ormand, playing the center role in a variation of the Cinderella tale. It was updated for the modern era, including the politics and finance of corporate take-overs, but otherwise is faithful to the theme of its predecessor. Among other things, one point seems to be clear: why Ford wanted it made. It's a full-blown screen confirmation (do I mean intention?) that our Indiana Jones Superstar still has that ""thing,"" that ability to attract younger women, as his character does in the story. Unfortunately, with a stiff, cardboard performance, he demonstrates none of the irony and vulnerability that Humphrey Bogart brought to this role. Likewise, as ravishing as Ormand can be, she, too, lacks the coquettish charm that Hepburn could provide. Together, they make an unappealing pair, as there's little apparent chemistry between the two stars.  Kinear, for his part, is pretty good, as he lately has developed a real penchant for playing the cad, but he too falls short when put up against William Holden.  To make matters worse, the script doesn't lend too much aid to the cast, lacking the wit and zest of the original. Overall, this is not a worthy re-do, but more simpy boring.Pollack would be the first one to admit that they don't make movies the way they used to.

Sabrina, the daughter of the chauffeur for the fabulously wealthy Larrabee clan, starts the movie as a dumpy little girl, watching the fantastic Larrabee Long Island parties from up in her tree through the world's most god-awful spectacles.  Completely infatuated with the Larrabee's younger son David (Greg Kinnear, in a perfect role for him), Sabrina mistakenly confesses her feelings to the older brother Linus (Harrison Ford) before heading off to Paris for her education.While in Paris, Sabrina works at one of those dream internships that people get in the movies - assisting photographers shoot models for magazine ads.  Surrounded by beautiful, artistic people in a beautiful, artistic city, Sabrina finds herself and emerges as a gorgeous, sophisticated woman.Sabrina returns to Long Island and promptly runs into David, who doesn't recognize her as the daughter of his chauffeur and shamelessly flirts with her even though he is engaged to another gorgeous woman, Dr. Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), who is just about too perfect for words.  Linus, of course, being the businessminded drone that he is, instantly recognizes both Sabrina and David's infatuation with her.This poses a problem -- Linus wants David to stay with Dr. Tyson, both for David's happiness (as he points out to David in a fun scene, &quot;she won't be a burden&quot;) and because Elizabeth's dad Patrick (Richard Crenna) is in tense negotiations with Linus and the negotiations would go better if they are family.  So Linus sets out to seduce Sabrina to keep her away from David -- after neutralizing David in a most creative fashion involving a champagne flute.Of course, during his efforts to seduce Sabrina, the hard-hearted Linus, who has always been a tyrant of a businessman, even as a child, falls for Sabrina, too.As you can see, a fairly predictable march through the numbers of romantic comedy.  The movie's charm is in its execution.  Director Sydney Pollack brings the best out of his talented cast, particularly Harrision Ford, who returns to the comic form he demonstrated in &quot;Working Girl&quot; but has been lacking in so many of his other efforts.The only jarring note in the movie is Sabrina's over-insistence of bringing up Paris in every conversation.  When looking at an old building on Martha's Vineyard, Sabrina inexplicably snots, &quot;In Paris, they would consider that brand-new.&quot;  While it's not surprising that she would return from Paris quite affected by the experience, at times in the movie it comes across as snobby rather than charming.But this is a minor quibble.  &quot;Sabrina&quot; is what it is -- an attractive comedy about attractive people falling in love in attractive settings by doing and saying attractive things.

Though not without its moments of drama, the Bogart/Hepburn film was lighter, more sparkling and witty, but also a little more shallow.  In that movie, I couldn't understand the attraction between Bogart and Hepburn; they never seem to connect across their age gap.In this remake of Sabrina, Julia Ormond gives a performance that's more mature and has more depth.  Once she goes to Paris and grows up, she truly grows up (unlike Hepburn, who is loveable but too childlike).  The love that develops between her character and Harrison Ford's is more believable; the movie takes more time and trouble to develop a plausible relationship between the grown up chaffeur's daughter and the billionaire without a social life.

397978,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,6304044836,Simon,"[2, 2]","Sabrina is a Cinderella story for modern times, and is also a fine update to the classic film that starred Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden. Sabrina (Julia Ormond) is the plain-looking daughter of a chauffeur to a wealthy family, and comes back transformed after an internship in Paris. She attracts the attention of the family's younger, playboy son (Greg Kinnear), and his older brother (Harrison Ford) must woo Sabrina away before she spoils the marriage/business merger he has been orchestrating.It's a very charming film, and is one of the few modern romantic comedies that makes you happy for the Hollywood ending instead of gagging at the cliche. It also avoids the typical bathroom humour and cheap gags, and stays relatively true to the original script with emphasis on character and dialogue. Some updates have been made though, sometimes to modernize (the wonder-plastic of the original has now been integrated into a flat screen tv) and sometimes to poke fun at story elements that were more acceptable in the 50s (Bogart could effortlessly kiss his brother's girlfriend and keep it within the family....Ford gets slapped). The cast is excellent all around. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn, but she makes the role her own and actually makes the Cinderella aspect of the plot more convincing. And in true 90's fashion, all the characters are deeper and more sympathetic, giving the cast more to play on.Sabrina is a fine film, on its own and compared to the original.
