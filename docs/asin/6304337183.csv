Sounds like a great `I Am Woman' sicko-revenge trip, right? It actually is, for the most part - it's just that the film (based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel) becomes a bit excessive with its over-dramatization, far-fetched kookiness and stereotypical hoopla. The whole thing turns into a `How can we outwit these miserable men and take all their money and be really clever and coy about it the whole while' kind of story. After years of helping their husbands build hugely successful businesses, the three women are callously dumped for younger, sexier ""trophy wives."" What I don't understand is why these smart, business-minded, middle-aged women bothered with their husbands in the first place, or why they expel all this narcissistic energy in dealing with them! (For Christ's sake ladies, let this film be an example, learn early that all men are good for nothing!) Oddly enough, Diane Keaton's on-screen daughter is the happiest person in the film, not to mention the least dysfunctional, and she's a lesbian!  The whole movie comes off like a cross between 9 To 5 and The War Of the Roses, though nowhere near as sick and deranged as the latter - The First Wives Club points out everything in light-hearted raillery. Bette Midler is excellent as Brenda, the wife of an electronics-emporium magnate, and Goldie Hawn, as good as always, plays Elise Elliot, an aging movie-star who can't get any roles -- an important issue in Hollywood right now (key word being `Hollywood'). Being a member of Joe Blow's Average America, its hard to feel really sympathetic for the character (or the real issue). So an actress can't pull down that typical 3 or 4 million any more -deal with it, get a job at Pizza Hut, or shut the hell up! Diane Keaton, on the other hand, seems a little out of place in such a `free and easy' production, though her performance is plenty good, as is Sarah Jessica Parker's as Shelly. There are also some delightful little cameos from Heather Lockear; Jon Stewart, Ivana Trump, Kathie Lee Gifford, James Naughton, Rob Reiner and Elizabeth Berkley.",4,Not as Sexist and Twisted as you Might Think,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,2287,"['Here', 'premise', 'suicide', 'close', 'college', 'friend', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'three', 'ex-wives', 'played', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'maneuver', 'destruction', 'ex-husbands', 'careers', 'lives', 'great', 'Am', 'Woman', 'sicko-revenge', 'trip', 'right', 'actually', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'film', 'based', 'Olivia', 'Goldsmith', 'novel', 'bit', 'excessive', 'over-dramatization', 'far-fetched', 'kookiness', 'stereotypical', 'hoopla', 'whole', 'thing', 'How', 'can', 'outwit', 'miserable', 'men', 'take', 'money', 'be', 'really', 'clever', 'coy', 'whole', 'while', 'kind', 'story', 'years', 'helping', 'husbands', 'build', 'hugely', 'successful', 'businesses', 'three', 'women', 'are', 'callously', 'dumped', 'younger', 'sexier', 'trophy', 'wives', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'smart', 'business-minded', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'bothered', 'husbands', 'first', 'place', 'why', 'expel', 'narcissistic', 'energy', 'dealing', 'Christ', 'sake', 'ladies', 'let', 'film', 'be', 'example', 'learn', 'early', 'men', 'are', 'good', 'nothing', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'on-screen', 'daughter', 'happiest', 'person', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'least', 'dysfunctional', 'lesbian', 'whole', 'movie', 'cross', '9', '5', 'War', 'Roses', 'nowhere', 'sick', 'deranged', 'latter', 'First', 'Club', 'points', 'out', 'everything', 'light-hearted', 'raillery', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'excellent', 'Brenda', 'wife', 'electronics-emporium', 'magnate', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'as', 'good', 'always', 'plays', 'Elise', 'Elliot', 'aging', 'movie-star', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'roles', 'important', 'issue', 'Hollywood', 'right', 'now', 'key', 'word', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'Being', 'member', 'Joe', 'Blow', 'Average', 'America', 'hard', 'feel', 'really', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'real', 'issue', 'actress', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'down', 'typical', '3', '4', 'million', 'more', '-deal', 'get', 'job', 'Pizza', 'Hut', 'shut', 'hell', 'up', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'other', 'hand', 'little', 'place', 'free', 'easy', 'production', 'performance', 'plenty', 'good', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Shelly', 'are', 'also', 'delightful', 'little', 'cameos', 'Heather', 'Lockear', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'Ivana', 'Trump', 'Kathie', 'Lee', 'Gifford', 'James', 'Naughton', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley']",N/A

No way. For years, actresses have been complaining that strong roles for women  are limited--if not absent--in Hollywood.

415207,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6304337183,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","Director Hugh Wilson's colorful and stylish 1996 comedy, based on a raunchier novel by the late Olivia Goldsmith(who cameos as a mourner at at funeral), greets us with Roy Liechtenstein-like art by Charles Beal, portraying women frequently engaged in various activities as Dionne Warwick sings her rendering of the '60s classic, ""Wives and Lovers"".Soon, the graphics fade, and Diane Keaton's repressed, guilt-ridden housewife, Annie Paradis, begins her narration with memories of her 1969 graduation from Middlebury College with her three best friends, who, via the brilliant casting of Ilene Starger, are played by actresses who bear incredibly strong resemblances to their middle-aged counterparts.The young graduates, including Annie(Adria Tenor), Brenda Murelli(Michele Brilliant), Elise Elliot(Dina Spybey) are gifted with sets of pearls by Valedictorian Cynthia Swann(Julihera DeStefano). Looking forward to bright futures, they toast the moment with champagne in paper cups as they pose for a snapshot of themselves. Indeed, the morning of life shines brilliantly for these four musketeers!But Life's midday(fast-forwarding to the '90s), is doleful. A now more mature Cynthia(Stockard Channing), is carrying another drink in hand, and giving her pearls to her maid, Theresa(Aida Linares) before making a fateful decision in response to her ex-husband's (James Naughton) jilting her for another woman(Heather Locklear).We find Annie being chided by her grown daughter, Chris(Jennifer Dundas), for being  a ""doormat"" to her estranged husband,Aaron(Stephen Collins), but lauded by her posessive mother, Catherine(Eileen Heckart) for the apparent reconciliation.Brenda(Bette Midler, snide, wisecracking, and playing for laughs as always)is busy coaxing her son Jason(Ari Greenberg) to study his Hebrew for his upcoming Bar Mitzphah, the only thing her estranged husband Morty(Dan Hedaya), who left her for a young woman who worked at his electronics store named Shelly Stewart(a churlish and manipulative Sarah Jessica Parker), is willing to pay for.We find the pampered, overindulgent actress, Elise(Goldie Hawn) in the chair of plastic surgeon Morris Packman(Rob Reiner) demanding yet another procedure despitehis claim that she has had too many.All three, who failed to keep in touch after graduation, as they had promised, share a jarring experience at the news of Cynthia's suicide.Reuniting at her funeral, they subsequently dine at at restaurant at Elise's invitation, and the presence of the empty chair at the table for four is palpable.Annie is the only one who cannot  publicly come to terms with the failure of her marriage, and will need to dismiss the psychobabble imposed on her by her therapist, Dr. Leslie Rosen (Marcia Gay Harden in the familar role of the femme fatale), whom both she and Aaron are seeing, but not quite for the same reasons, and accept the reality of her situation instead of trying to cling to an unrealistically postive view of things.Soon the reality will be jarringly and unavoidably harsh.In the company of Duarto Feliz(Bronson Pinchot), the interior decorator for whom she works, Brenda has an unpleasant run-in with Morty and Shelly at a women's clothing store, and Elyse learns her divorce settlement will include her having to pay her ex-husband Bill(Victor Garber)alimony, although she was the one who taught him the business, and he is in actuality, indebted to her.She also learns that her attempt to look younger has not paid off when Director Brett Artounian(Timothy Olyphant) hires her for the part of the older lead in his film when she'd hoped for the part of the younger woman, a role which will go to Bill's bimbo lover, Phoebe LaVelle(Elizabeth Berkley) who ultimately could be Bill's ruin.The recipience of the three suicide notes from Cynthia spurs Annie into action. The three women meet, and discuss how best to deal with their situation in what becomes the first meeting of the First Wives Club.Forging alliances with Elyse's friend, Gunilla Garson Goldberg(the incomparable Maggie Smith), the highly influential Queen of New York Society, and gaining support from Duarto, Chris, and Brenda's Sicillian Uncle Carmine(Phillip Bosco), the last of whom will be the muscle behind their operation,they carry out an agenda which will not only result in justice on behalf of themselves, but, amid some trepidation and strife,will eventually benefit society at large as well.Along for the ride are Kate Burton, Walter Bobbie, Debra Monk, and Jennifer Lam in cameo roles, as are Ed Koch, Gloria Steinem,Kathie Lee Gifford, and Ivana Trump, who utters the film's most famous line, ""Don't get mad. Get everything!""This is a cleverly crafted production that reveals the strength and renewal of forgotten abilities by the unity of three  friends in the midst of a crisis, who ultmately channel their powers towards the greater good.Three women reunited dressed in mourning will celebrate a victory clad in various shades of off-white, each sporting their precious pearls as a way to figuratively keep Cynthia near.The formerly timid Annie recounts her fear at having to sing for Cynthia on her 21st birthday, along with Brenda and Elyse. But ultimately these women sing not only for the fallen Cynthia, but also for themselves and for their triumph over adversity that their unity has created.",5,Singing for Cynthia,1307318400,"06 6,

Most people would skip movies like that because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". Unfortunately, First Wives Club is not a ""clean"" movie. I actually watch it with a ClearPlay filter.There are some sexual references, such as a girl tells her mother and father she is a lesbian; a man is seen in a dressing gown, his chest is seen; three women go to a gay club; all three ""wives"" husbands left them for a younger woman, whom they are having affairs with.The only violence shown is a woman steps onto a step preparing to jump off a building, but then they cut the scene away; a woman hits another woman with a form baton for ""therapy""; three women slap each other in turn.There are quite a few instances of minor curse words used throughout the movie and a woman is seen drinking and smoking at the beginning of the film and one woman drinks throughout the film.The movie is about four college friends who lost touch with each other, until one of them commits suicide because her husband left her for a younger woman, and so kills herself because of loneliness.  The other three reunite after their friends funeral only to discover their lives aren't much better.  Brenda is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially. Elise, whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat. Annie, meanwhile, is separated, suffering extreme self-esteem issues, and going through therapy with her husband, until she finds out that he wants a divorce and is having an affair with their therapist  With the help of Annie's daughter, Brenda's Uncle Carmine who has Maufia connections, and Elise's money, they form the First Wives Club.  They starts out just wanting revenge, but then decide that it would make them no better than their husbands. So when they find out that Brenda's husband is guilty of income tax fraud, Elise's husband is dating a minor, and Annie's husband's business partners want to sell their shares, and so with the help of Elise, Annie buys them out - they use these situations to push their men into funding their new nonprofit organization dedicated to aiding abused women, in memory of their college friend Cynthia.Overall, I like the movie.

415232,A1VLSIVP809ZYW,6304337183,H. Hedrick,"[12, 33]","The distinctive thing about this movie for me is that it is superficially adequate, but a very, very bad movie upon closer examination.  For example, It must be a comedy since it can not fall into any other genre, but it is not funny.  Somehow, this is not immediately obvious until afterwards when you reflect back upon what you have seen.  I can not really explain this characteristic of the movie.To continue, the movie is about the revenge of three women against their ex-husbands who have left them for younger women.  In the process, the children are used against the fathers.  Blackmail is utilized.  I don't have a problem with this.  Funny movies have been made about canibalism.  Funny movies have been made about divorce.  However, if you are going to make such a movie, it has to go over the top.  This movie handles everything like a sitcom.  To make matters worse, it seems to realize at the end that it has gone too far and become politically incorrect.  At root, the movie is making a statement that all men all scum.  Once it gets to the end, it proceeds to spend an interminable amount of time in trying ot redeem itself by having the three women open a crisis center for women.  This entire period is very, very, very long without any laughs.  I mean without any jokes.Other random observations:  Not since the theatrical release of ""Bladerunner"" has a narration been so unnecessary.  One of the children is made into a lesbian so that the three women can go to a lesbian bar, and the sequence is not funny.  The before mentioned lesbian hates her father and surprises him with an announcement that she is a lesbian.  Perhaps some film maker somewhere could make this work as a punchline, but it doesn't work here.  Goldie Hawn's character actually wears makeup to make herself grosteque.  This is funny?  Oh yea, her character is an alcoholic who has an instantanteous recovery.  Bette Midler is actually quite good in this movie as an actress, but not as a comedience.  Lets see.  You have a movie about wives getting back at their husbands, and Bette Midler plays it almost straight.  I think she could have perhaps chewed some scenery.  This is the problem with the movie.

The movie starts when Brenda (Bette Midler), Elise (Goldie Hawn) and Annie (Diane Keaton), all find out their friend Cynthia has commited suicide. At the funeral they meet up again, as they were college friends, and they start hanging out with each other more often. Annie's marriage is in the dumps, she's seeing a therapist, and later finds out the therapist is seeing her husband! Brenda is separated from her husband Morty but is still raising her son, and Elise is divorcing her husband Bill who in turn wants alimony. These women, furious, decide to take a stand and fight back, and they sure do!

Though they were incredibly close in school, their lives drifted apart afterwards. One became an actress (Goldie Hawn), one became a timid housewife (Diane Keaton) and the other became a very assertive housewife (Bette Middler). After all these years, there is only one thing that they have in common. All three have been dumped by their husbands in favor of younger women. They're not going to take it laying down and decide to recoup their losses, wreack havoc and have some fun doing it.This is a very entertaining film. The characterizations are strong almost to the point of being charactures but there is some depth to it as well. These women are dealing with real pain. In accordance with the old maxim that shared pain is lessened, they share first with each other and then with their ex-husbands. I almost feel sorry for the cretins near the end but not quite.This is never going to be considered a great classic but it is thoroughly worthwhile for its entertainment value.

415267,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6304337183,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[32, 39]","In 1996, Hugh Wilson directed a very funny comedy about three friends that were all dumped by their husbands for younger women in the film ""First Wives Club"".  Based upon the 1992 novel of the same name by Olivia Goldsmith (1949-2004), the three friends (who had met in college) are brought back together after their fourth friend, Cynthia Swann Griffin (Stockard Channing), jumped from her penthouse apartment in Manhattan after her husband left and she felt totally alone.  Upon learning about each others similar marital problems, the surviving friends, which include the boisterous Brenda Cushman (Bette Midler), the movie actress Elise Elliot (Goldie Hawn) and the timid Annie Paradis (Diane Keaton), decide to work together to attain vengence upon their ex-husbands.  Brenda's ex-husband, Morton 'Morty' Cushman (Dan Hedaya), wants to marry the very young and shallow Shelly Stewart (Sarah Jessica Parker).  Elise's ex-husband, Bill Atchison (Victor Garber), is dating the very young aspiring actress Phoebe LaVelle (Elizabeth Berkley).  Annie's separated husband, Aaron Paradis (Stephen Collins), is having an affair with Annie's therapist, Dr. Leslie Rosen (Marcia Gay Harden).  To assist them, the trio of first wives enlist help from their friends, which include the interior decorator Duarto Feliz (Bronson Pinchot), Annie's daughter Chris Paradis (Jennifer Dundas), the socialite Gunilla Garson Goldberg (Maggie Smith) and Brenda's Uncle Carmine (Philip Bosco).Though the plot was somewhat weak and the acting and screen writing were not Oscar-worthy, ""First Wives Club"" is still very entertaining and engaging.  The most memorable acting comes from Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, Sarah Jessica Parker and Victor Garber.  The film did receive an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score.  Memorable scenes in the film include Cynthia on her balcony, her funeral, the trio at the restaurant, Elise visiting Bill's office, Annie's visits with Dr. Leslie Rosen, Morty's commercial, Shelly with Gunilla, Morty's apartment, the auction, the fight, Annie's purchase, Chris' announcement and the closing scenes.  Other memorable characters include Annie's mother Catherine MacDuggan (Eileen Heckart, 1919-2001), Dr. Morris Packman (Rob Reiner) and Brenda's son Jason (Ari Greenberg), as well as cameos by Ivana Trump, Kathie Lee Gifford, Gloria Steinem and former NYC mayor Edward I. Koch.  Olivia Goldsmith also made an unaccredited cameo.  Overall, I rate ""First Wives Club"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It's a fun film that both women and men can enjoy, though women may enjoy it more since the men in the film are the bad guys.",4,"""If only she'd called me.

415275,A228JH8V9Y700G,6304337183,MortensOrchid,"[3, 4]","This was a chick flick in many respects, but not so sappy and irrational that it annoys you like other chick flicks do.  All three leads are legitimately angry and the audience feels for them, because we've all been scorned (whether you're a man or a woman, but it will obviously speak to you moreso if you are a woman).  I wouldn't give this 4 stars because the song and dance routines were lame and kind of annoying.Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler are three old friends who are reunited over the death of a college friend.  She committed suicide off her penthouse suite after her husband left her for another woman.  The three receive letters from her sent just before she jumped expressing her grief.  She wished she had all that they did, and that they were still good friends.  The three get back together after her funeral and discover that while the years have affected them differently they have all experienced the same woes when their husbands, who they were there to support in their early, lean years, achieved success, and all left them for younger women.Diane Keaton, perhaps the weakest of them all, endures her mother's bullying and her daughter's coming out on top of her divorce, plus being used by her estranged husband while he is also seeing her therapist who she had been paying to help her sort out her problems.  {Ewww)  Goldie Hawn is an actress who, in an industry which glorifies youth and beauty unlike any other, had her husband leave her for a younger woman even though she has pulled her face taught and self medicating with alcohol rather than popping pain pills.  Bette Middler, the funniest of them all and always the star of every show, had her husband leave her for Shelly, a shark of a younger woman who was working in her husband's furniture store.  Being traded in for a newer model, the three decide to form a union to not just help themselves but other women in similar situation.The plot unfolds in a series of screwball comedy antics, revelation, tears, and ultimately personal triumph for all, but it also tells us something else that we don't like talking about much.  Women have a fear of being overthrown based on their age, of getting dried up and loosing their attractiveness.  Then, when their husbands / boyfriends get tired of them they will be inevitably traded in for younger women.  Why?  There is no one answer to this.  Greed, a realization of one's own mortality, the proverbial ""midlife crisis"" situation, physical attractiveness or unattractiveness all play a role.  There is no real answer.  But, women have to stop harping on those things.  Society doesn't smile upon it, but women should start dating younger men too.  I have, and it's been very rewarding.  If you don't have a boyfriend/husband, well get over it and be happy with yourself.  You don't need a man to make yourself complete, you're a queen and deserve to be one.  And younger women, don't buy into this thing of dating older men because you find ones your own age jeuvenile or awkward.  Older men are just as jeuvenile and awkward to be going for someone young enough to be their daughter.The best revelation I found in this movie was Bette Midler's husband's realization about his trophy wife.  While she is obviously a tornado in the sack, she summed it up best when she said she was not Brenda (his ex wife).  He simply said ""No, you're not"".  He realized he had made a mistake, and that he was thinking with something other than his brain.  I guess guys are just like that, they have to learn the hard way that they don't want some bubbleheaded, self centered princess.  They want to feel superior, but they want to be challenged as well.  Give them just enough of a challenge, and if they dump you make them feel guilty that they screwed up and let a wonderful woman like you slip through their fingers.",4,You don't know how good you have it until it's gone,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,3848,"['was', 'chick', 'flick', 'many', 'respects', 'not', 'so', 'sappy', 'irrational', 'other', 'chick', 'flicks', 'do', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'legitimately', 'angry', 'audience', 'feels', ""'ve"", 'been', 'scorned', ""'re"", 'man', 'woman', 'will', 'obviously', 'speak', 'moreso', 'are', 'woman', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', '4', 'stars', 'song', 'dance', 'routines', 'were', 'lame', 'kind', 'annoying.Diane', 'Keaton', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'are', 'three', 'old', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'reunited', 'death', 'college', 'friend', 'committed', 'suicide', 'penthouse', 'suite', 'husband', 'left', 'woman', 'three', 'receive', 'letters', 'sent', 'just', 'jumped', 'expressing', 'grief', 'wished', 'had', 'did', 'were', 'still', 'good', 'friends', 'three', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'funeral', 'discover', 'years', 'have', 'affected', 'differently', 'have', 'experienced', 'same', 'woes', 'when', 'husbands', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'support', 'early', 'lean', 'years', 'achieved', 'success', 'left', 'younger', 'women.Diane', 'Keaton', 'perhaps', 'weakest', 'mother', 'bullying', 'daughter', 'coming', 'out', 'top', 'divorce', 'being', 'used', 'estranged', 'husband', 'also', 'seeing', 'therapist', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'paying', 'help', 'sort', 'problems', 'Ewww', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'actress', 'who', 'industry', 'youth', 'beauty', 'other', 'had', 'husband', 'leave', 'younger', 'woman', 'even', 'pulled', 'face', 'taught', 'self', 'medicating', 'alcohol', 'rather', 'popping', 'pain', 'pills', 'Bette', 'Middler', 'funniest', 'always', 'star', 'show', 'had', 'husband', 'leave', 'Shelly', 'shark', 'younger', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'husband', 'furniture', 'store', 'Being', 'traded', 'newer', 'model', 'three', 'decide', 'form', 'union', 'not', 'just', 'help', 'other', 'women', 'similar', 'situation.The', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'series', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'antics', 'revelation', 'tears', 'ultimately', 'personal', 'triumph', 'also', 'something', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'talking', 'much', 'Women', 'have', 'fear', 'being', 'overthrown', 'based', 'age', 'getting', 'dried', 'up', 'loosing', 'attractiveness', 'Then', 'when', 'husbands', '/', 'boyfriends', 'get', 'tired', 'will', 'be', 'inevitably', 'traded', 'younger', 'women', 'Why', 'one', 'answer', 'Greed', 'realization', 'one', 'own', 'mortality', 'proverbial', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'situation', 'physical', 'attractiveness', 'unattractiveness', 'play', 'role', 'real', 'answer', 'women', 'have', 'stop', 'harping', 'things', 'Society', ""n't"", 'smile', 'women', 'should', 'start', 'dating', 'younger', 'men', 'too', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'rewarding', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'boyfriend/husband', 'well', 'get', 'be', 'happy', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'man', 'make', 'complete', ""'re"", 'queen', 'deserve', 'be', 'one', 'younger', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'thing', 'dating', 'older', 'men', 'find', 'ones', 'own', 'age', 'jeuvenile', 'awkward', 'Older', 'men', 'are', 'just', 'jeuvenile', 'awkward', 'be', 'going', 'someone', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'daughter.The', 'best', 'revelation', 'found', 'movie', 'was', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'husband', 'realization', 'trophy', 'wife', 'obviously', 'tornado', 'sack', 'summed', 'up', 'best', 'when', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'Brenda', 'ex', 'wife', 'simply', 'said', 'No', ""'re"", 'not', 'realized', 'had', 'made', 'mistake', 'was', 'thinking', 'something', 'other', 'brain', 'guess', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'have', 'learn', 'hard', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'bubbleheaded', 'centered', 'princess', 'want', 'feel', 'superior', 'want', 'be', 'challenged', 'as', 'well', 'Give', 'just', 'enough', 'challenge', 'dump', 'make', 'feel', 'guilty', 'screwed', 'up', 'let', 'wonderful', 'woman', 'slip', 'fingers']",N/A

Starting in the 60's, men and women got married and the woman supported men while he got his college degree or helped him build his business.  Then, once successful, they left their wives for younger women.This is the basis for this film.  Cynthia (Stockard Channing), Annie (Diane Keaton), Elise (Goldie Hawn) and Brenda (Bette Middler) are all sorority sisters.  Over the years they have lost touch with each other.  All married and made their husbands wealthy.  When Cynthia's husband leaves her, she commits suicide.  The other three reunite after Cynthia's funeral.  Each claiming that their shaky marriage is solid.Eventually, each husband trades in for the younger model.  Annie, Elise and Brenda are determined not have a similar fate as Cynthia.  Each has their own issues but one by one they pick off the ex's.  The best are Elise taking all of the marital assets and selling them for $1 and the next involves society matron Gunulla (Maggie Smith) taking Brenda's ex's bimbo (Jessica Sarah Parker) under her wing.This is a hilarious fantasy that any person that has been dumped will love.  Some of the scenes are silly but overall it hits true.Bette of course steals the show but Maggie Smith could have stolen the show if her part was bigger.DVD EXTRAS: None",5,Revenge of the Ex's,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,1361,"['next', 'generation', 'chick', 'flick', 'chick', 'flick', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'Starting', '60', 'men', 'women', 'got', 'married', 'woman', 'supported', 'men', 'got', 'college', 'degree', 'helped', 'build', 'business', 'Then', 'once', 'successful', 'left', 'wives', 'younger', 'women.This', 'basis', 'film', 'Cynthia', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Annie', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Elise', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Brenda', 'Bette', 'Middler', 'are', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'years', 'have', 'lost', 'touch', 'other', 'married', 'made', 'husbands', 'wealthy', 'When', 'Cynthia', 'husband', 'suicide', 'other', 'three', 'reunite', 'Cynthia', 'funeral', 'claiming', 'shaky', 'marriage', 'solid.Eventually', 'husband', 'trades', 'younger', 'model', 'Annie', 'Elise', 'Brenda', 'are', 'determined', 'not', 'have', 'similar', 'fate', 'Cynthia', 'own', 'issues', 'one', 'one', 'pick', 'off', 'ex', 'best', 'are', 'Elise', 'taking', 'marital', 'assets', 'selling', '1', 'next', 'society', 'matron', 'Gunulla', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'taking', 'Brenda', 'ex', 'bimbo', 'Jessica', 'Sarah', 'Parker', 'wing.This', 'hilarious', 'fantasy', 'person', 'been', 'dumped', 'will', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'silly', 'overall', 'true.Bette', 'course', 'steals', 'show', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'could', 'have', 'stolen', 'show', 'part', 'was', 'bigger.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A

And yet that is a good thing- since the book version is to me so very isolating and dull, while the movie is heart- warming friendship- comedy type of story which makes it a lot better. So yes- if you are planning to read the book- don't expect it to be at all like the movie, and I don't recommend the book at all.I do recommend this movie though highly. It is as I said a comedy at a best, with an actual strong cast to carry it off well. It is a true chick- flick, and I knew many men would get upset at it just because of the fact the men in the story didn't get their cake and eat it too. Well too bad. The whole point of the story was that the women helped their husbands get to their lofty positions and then when they got there they dropped the wives after all their love and support for younger trophy wives, and so the first wives got back what they themselves had actually worked for and not the men. If the men want it back they can actually work for it this time on their own. That was the whole point and I felt it was good justice. And no, I don't hate men- but I feel men who do the acts these men did to their first wives had the ""What goes around comes around"" saying coming to them, and it did.

I saw this movie when I was 17 back when I was in 10th grade.Even to this day, I still remember how mean-spirited this movie was. I don't care how you look at it, it's really just mindless cruelty to 3 guys who had nothing to do with the death of the friend of their 3 ex-wives. What they did to those innocent guys financially was in my opinion totally mean and uncalled for.I thought that maybe the movie would be funny and turn out good at the very end. However, other than that guy Morty getting back together with his ex-wive, it was no better for the other 2 guys. I honestly did not enjoy this movie one bit. In fact, this movie enraged me and ended up hating women in general for a few hours to a few days after the movie was over.Selling Bill's yellow Lamborghini at that auction and then having it bought back by his own money was indeed terrible! That's a car more valuable than a Ferrari!This movie utterly disgusted me all the way.
