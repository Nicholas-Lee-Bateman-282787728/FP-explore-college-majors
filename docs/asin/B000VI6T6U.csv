1101682,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B000VI6T6U,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[12, 20]","Jeepers creepers if I want to see a documentary of the repugnant Lou Adler, well I guess I should just get a Jimi Hendrix documentary . . .The two bit rating here reflects only the collection as a whole and the packaging, not the Jimi Hendrix concert itself, which it goes without saying evokes an infinity of stars. The stars that play with . . . For one thing, there is a space for two DVD disks inside the package, but only one disk. I thought I must have lost something . . .There are way too many of the usual sharks and parasites on this disk, and far too many quick tantalizing shots of Jimi paying earlier venues. Even the advertised shots of him playing a club in England are editted into pieces and incomplete. I guess the company wants to sell it complete later. And the cool real early unmoustached shot of him lip synching Hey Joe seriously with no silly faces, well let's see the whole thing . . .Meanwhile we see over and over and comprehensively the many sides of Lou Adler . . .At least we do get here the famous introduction by Brian Jones, founder of the Rolling Stones as a Chicago Blues band who lost his baby to the Glimmer Twins and Andrew Loog Oldham (who also appears here inexplicably) and then died mysteriously. What we hear of Brian's voice here is far more than ever appeared on any Stones recording, and even here it is badly miked and poorly filmed.What is missing from this concert recording is the Can you see me (after Hey Joe and before Wind Cries Mary?) when all six cameras got dropped, apparently. There is a lot of editting and cutting in this edition, as suddenly we pass from Hey Joe into Wind as Jimi runs over to Noel to straghten him out or tune up together or whatever, and then we skip to the same stock crowd scene we have already seen three times.And whoever was doing the lighting was not clear on the concept, nor on the star of the show, and much is in inexplicable darkness. THe entire final verse of Wind is in darkness, and the producers finally find a silhouette rear shot with a bit of light.Part of the racism of the time, and the shock at the visibly enthusiastic energy. Brian said this was the most exciting act he had ever seen, and he had seen more than anyone ever should have to of Mick Jagger . . . Is this why the Glimmer Twins offed him?They do leave in the snatch of Strangers in the Night, a standard Sinatra and daughter tune boring the airwaves at that time. Some copies of this concert leave it out as not included in the commercial licensing, but it is here, played one handed with the other arm covering his face, for instance in that dvd which starts with some splatter artist doing a portrait to some tune. To whomsoever said he played lousy on this concert: try this Sinatra playing at home . . .What makes this disk really useless is that despite the advertised six camera angles (when six were on and aimed at the star), it can only be invoked with the Angle button on your remote. Hey, guys, give me a break! I play these on my PC; where is the Angle button on my keyboard?So the only thing worthwhile is the concert tape itself: the half hour intro is eminently skippable (more of LOU ADLER!!??). And I cannot get to the other camera angles which would save me the embarrassment of seeing anything to do with the hateful Noel Redding (whom Jimi keeps calling Bob Dylan's grandmother, especially when he thunders his bass while Jimi is talking to the audience telling them how much he loves them, and how much it means to him to play in America, and getting ready to sacrifice his guitar to them. He also alters the first line of Purple Haze to read: ""'Scuse me while I kiss this guy!"" pointing at Noel. Their ""friendship"" only went downhill from there, but Noel always used the N word with Jimi when that was not too cool and definitely no joke.)So if all we have is the standard concert tape, we might as well get Jimi Plays Monterey/Shake! Otis at Monterey - Criterion Collection. I only used to hear this concert on vinyl, backed with the electrifying Otis concert: I been loving you too long . . . So when I watch this dvd and Lou Adler drones on again about how great he himself is, I keep wanting to flip it over and hear Otis on the dock of the bay before they killed him too!

You will experience more than enjoyment and appreciation when watching his act at the Monterey Pop Festival, you will be amazed.

This is very good historical footage. If you are a Jimi Hendrix fan, I'm sure you'll find this dvd to be very enjoyable. Jimi was definitely one of the greatest guitar players ever. Plus, he was highly influencial to many, many other blues rock guitarists.However, I was a little disappointed in Jimi's live performance in this dvd. After all, I have read about how great he was, & how ""Rolling Stone"" magazine duded him, the Greatest Guitar Player ever. I was expecting a better live performance, than Jimi's performance on this dvd. In all due respect, Jimi did put on a very good performance, but I was expecting better. The main highlight for me was at the end of his performance, he poured lighter fluid on his guitar and set it on fire. This was reminescent of Jerry Lee Lewis, pouring lighter fluid on this pianos and setting them on fire, when he'd end his show, while playing ""Great Balls of Fire"".Also, I've been reading the book, ""My Cross to Bear"", the memiors of Gregg Allman. In this book, Gregg mentions that he got to see Jimi perform live, and that he too, was disappointed in Jimi's live performance. He also was expecting a better performance from Jimi, than what he saw live. Apparently Jimi was a lot better in a recording studio, because he recorded some of the best blues rock records ever.However, I have a lot of respect for Jimi Hendrix, because he wrote some dang good, blues rock songs. Plus, he was a great influence on many future blues rock guitarists. The Jimi Hendrix Classic ""Voodoo Chile"", has been carried on by many other blues rock guitarists. The late/great Stevie Ray Vaughan was greatly influenced by Jimi, and SRV included the song ""Voodoo Chile"" in his regular song sets, that he performed at concerts. Plus, he even recorded a studio version of it. Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top has also commented that he was highly influenced by Jimi Hendrix. Also, Kenny Wayne Sheperd, Eric Johnson, along with many, many other blues guitarists state they were greatly influenced by Jimi Hendrix.This dvd is packed full of Bonus Material, mostly documentary in nature.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[27, 30]","Jimi Hendrix's closing set at the Monterey Pop Festival (following the Who's destruction of their own instruments) was only 40 minutes long  - but what an impressive 40 minutes! Will anyone who has seen the footage of him burning his guitar on stage (shown on the cover of this DVD) every forget that image?This reasonably priced DVD from Experience Hendrix (managed by Jimi's sister Janie) contains those 40 minutes and so much more. Guitar aficionados will appreciate the option to see different camera angles (my DVD player shows the angle image throughout so it wasn't important to me). Archivist types will enjoy the inclusion of the earliest existing footage of the Hendrix band playing in a small club in 1967. The new documentary ""American Landing"" has some fascinating interviews with those involved and is useful in explaining Hendrix's popularity to the next generation of fans.Another bonus which I found as a ""hidden gem"" is ""Music Love and Flowers"" a nice mini documentary on the Monterey Pop Festival itself. Sure the complete festival is out there on video on D.A. Pennebaker's film, but this short extra gives the background and contains new interviews with Lou Adler and John Phillips who basically organized it. This makes this package of interest even to fringe Hendrix fans.If Jimi was alive now he'd be eligible for Medicare this week!
