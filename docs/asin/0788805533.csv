78800,ASC5CH6RALOHL,0788805533,"Alden Utter ""nedlum""","[9, 13]","There is no way to deny it (and why would you?): The Lion King is animation at it's finest. The sequal, however, is no more then an attempt to cash in on the good version.Start at the beginning. The Lion King had one of the strongest openings I have ever seen, a magnificant score over an epic sweep, as Simba is proclaimed king.Simba's Pride steals a song from the Broadway musical.It's a nice song, but it's hardly strong enough to pull you in. Then, they actually have Timon and Pumba talk before the title screen. The Lion King, by contrast, had the title screen appear the second the song climaxed.The problem is, ""They Live in You"" doesn't climax; it fades.To be fair to the song, neither does the movie. There is sort of a zenophobic feel to parts, as Simba and Zazu talk about the ""Outsiders"" that were banished for unknown crimes. They are loyal to Scar, although why is never stated; perhaps because he never kicked them out. Lead by Scar's mate, they groom her son, Kovu (although, to be clear, he is not Scar's son, so no incest is going) to kill Simba and take his place. But he becomeas good, falls in love, yada yada yada, movies over.The music has some decent parts, but nothing on par with ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"", the weakest (in my veiw) song of the Lion King. And the background score is in the shadow of the majesty of the Lion King. There are only a few parts with choral voices as music-another minus, as singing under a scene is a universal good.Honsetly? If you didn't like the Lion King, there's nothing here for you. If you did, and you've seen it fifteen times, watch it again. There's stil nothing here for you that the original doesn't have ten times over.",1,Simba's Shame,1030492800,"08 28, 2002",2002,1693,"['way', 'deny', 'why', 'would', 'Lion', 'King', 'animation', 'finest', 'sequal', 'however', 'more', 'then', 'attempt', 'cash', 'good', 'version.Start', 'beginning', 'Lion', 'King', 'had', 'one', 'strongest', 'openings', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'magnificant', 'score', 'epic', 'sweep', 'Simba', 'proclaimed', 'king.Simba', 'Pride', 'song', 'Broadway', 'musical.It', 'nice', 'song', 'hardly', 'strong', 'enough', 'pull', 'Then', 'actually', 'have', 'Timon', 'Pumba', 'talk', 'title', 'screen', 'Lion', 'King', 'contrast', 'had', 'title', 'screen', 'appear', 'second', 'song', 'climaxed.The', 'problem', 'Live', ""n't"", 'climax', 'fades.To', 'be', 'fair', 'song', 'movie', 'sort', 'zenophobic', 'feel', 'parts', 'Simba', 'Zazu', 'talk', 'Outsiders', 'were', 'banished', 'unknown', 'crimes', 'are', 'loyal', 'Scar', 'why', 'never', 'stated', 'perhaps', 'never', 'kicked', 'out', 'Lead', 'Scar', 'mate', 'groom', 'son', 'Kovu', 'be', 'clear', 'not', 'Scar', 'son', 'so', 'incest', 'going', 'kill', 'Simba', 'take', 'place', 'becomeas', 'good', 'love', 'yada', 'yada', 'movies', 'over.The', 'music', 'decent', 'parts', 'nothing', 'par', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Wait', 'be', 'King', 'weakest', 'veiw', 'song', 'Lion', 'King', 'background', 'score', 'shadow', 'majesty', 'Lion', 'King', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'parts', 'choral', 'voices', 'music-another', 'minus', 'singing', 'scene', 'universal', 'good.Honsetly', 'did', ""n't"", 'Lion', 'King', 'nothing', 'here', 'did', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fifteen', 'times', 'watch', 'again', 'stil', 'nothing', 'here', 'original', ""n't"", 'have', 'ten', 'times']",N/A
78801,A2T2MYZEB81NOQ,0788805533,"Alex K ""Catman""","[4, 7]","What can I say. This movie is SPECTACULAR! It has more cool cast members newly made along with the returning ones and a better story line. Not to mention my # 1 favorite Lion King character of all time(Kiara, Simba's daughter, of course! Nala's the next best!)Any how, the story follows Kiara's life while Simba and Nala rule along with her meeting with her mate-to-be Kovu as well as Zira, the evil villain of this movie and Scar's evil mate, who wants to kill Simba and make Kovu king. Of course, I could tell you the whole story as I did on other movie reviews, but that'd ruin it. Here's all of the pros and cons, as far as I'm concerned, in this near-perfect film.Pros:Kiara, my favorite character, is introduced & leaves such a markKovu is also cool, and he too leaves a mark just as greatSimba and Nala are back as rulers & are they funnier than beforeZira, my favorite TLK villain, not only causes as much havoc and chaos as she should, she also has a way of intimidation. ChillingZazu is a bit less clumsy in this movie than he was in the firstVitani, another cool female character, shows herself as a real hard-head and soon moves from Zira's side to doing great heroicsThere is lots of funny and/or memorable quotes and scenesThe serious parts are as dark and evil as they should be. DamnCons:Timon and Pumbaa return(HOW LONG, OH LORD?!)I hated them in the original, I hated them in 1 1/2, I hate them now in this one. If they weren't in this masterpiece, it would be perfect! Nuff saidThe hyenas don't return in this movie. Though I'm glad they're not dead(just back in the elephant graveyard after learning the harshest lesson in the world)it would've rocked if Shenzi and Banzai returned. I'm glad Ed's gone, mind you, he sucks & I hate him, but Shenzi and Banzai were wonderful. Especially Shenzi. If only they could've come back in this movie. Oh well.

78802,A8OC3MEMURC18,0788805533,Alice BluePenn,"[1, 2]","Overall, 'The Lion King II' is a weak sequel to a sterling classic. Creating non-existent characters simply for a movie is just irritating and careless. The movie's basic plot is: Scar had a mate. She and Scar's lionesses (they are apart from Mufasa's lionesses) are banished upon Simba's return. But Zira's cub, Kovu, is being trained to kill Simba, but then Kovu falls in love with Simba's daughter, Kiara. Will love heal all?, etc.) In the original, Simba and his lionesses fought against Scar and his hyena army ONLY. If Scar's hand-picked lionesses ""existed"" it would have been a major point in the movie. Also, the animation isn't bad--but the drawing is more flat and less beautiful than the original movie. Many parts are obviously computer-animated but to look like hand-drawn. Now--the story itself; the basic plot is predictable, but some action violence is inappropriate for children under 10-11 years old. It lacks a little of the warmth and hope of the first movie. There is only one memorable song. What saves the movie is the love between Kiara and Kovu, and Kovu's changing character. The new characters are, overall, interesting and original. A good movie to watch once, but easily forgettable.",3,"Weak, with a few good points.",1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,1212,"['Overall', 'Lion', 'King', 'II', 'weak', 'sequel', 'sterling', 'classic', 'Creating', 'non-existent', 'characters', 'simply', 'movie', 'just', 'irritating', 'careless', 'movie', 'basic', 'plot', 'Scar', 'had', 'mate', 'Scar', 'lionesses', 'are', 'apart', 'Mufasa', 'lionesses', 'are', 'banished', 'Simba', 'return', 'Zira', 'cub', 'Kovu', 'being', 'trained', 'kill', 'Simba', 'then', 'Kovu', 'love', 'Simba', 'daughter', 'Kiara', 'Will', 'love', 'heal', 'etc', 'original', 'Simba', 'lionesses', 'fought', 'Scar', 'hyena', 'army', 'ONLY', 'Scar', 'hand-picked', 'lionesses', 'existed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'point', 'movie', 'Also', 'animation', ""n't"", 'bad', 'drawing', 'more', 'flat', 'less', 'beautiful', 'original', 'movie', 'Many', 'parts', 'are', 'obviously', 'computer-animated', 'look', 'hand-drawn', 'Now', 'story', 'basic', 'plot', 'predictable', 'action', 'violence', 'inappropriate', 'children', '10-11', 'years', 'old', 'little', 'warmth', 'hope', 'first', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'memorable', 'song', 'What', 'movie', 'love', 'Kiara', 'Kovu', 'Kovu', 'changing', 'character', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'overall', 'interesting', 'original', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'once', 'easily', 'forgettable']",N/A

The music is great and I turn the volume up while my five-year old points out the various animals in the Pride Lands waiting for the appearance of the new cub.

There are funny parts in the movie with Timon and Pumbaa, the characters that we have seen from their cable show on the Disney channel.Simba's Pride is a movie that was made for video only. The animation is superb with the sounds of the lions roar first rate. The sibling rivalry between Kovu and his older brother who constantly refers to Kovu as a termite is funny and pathetic at times.While viewing this video you will learn the plans of the Badlanders who feel like outsiders and see Simba as the one who killed Scar their leader.

It is a great story of getting along and letting go of old battle scars.The story line has the siblings, parents, and the young ones all developing relationships within the Pride Lands along with the silly antics of Timon and Pumbaa.The movie will lift you up making you want to turn up the volume and tap your feet as well as sitting on the edge of your seat.",5,The Future Queen of the Pridelands,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,1559,"['video', 'usual', 'previews', 'immediately', 'story', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'music', 'great', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', 'five-year', 'old', 'points', 'out', 'various', 'animals', 'Pride', 'Lands', 'waiting', 'appearance', 'new', 'cub', 'are', 'deer', 'elephants', 'zebras', 'lions.Lion', 'King', 'II', 'Simba', 'Pride', 'journey', 'circle', 'life', 'animals', 'are', 'funny', 'parts', 'movie', 'Timon', 'Pumbaa', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'cable', 'show', 'Disney', 'channel.Simba', 'Pride', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'video', 'only', 'animation', 'superb', 'sounds', 'lions', 'roar', 'first', 'rate', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'Kovu', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'constantly', 'Kovu', 'termite', 'funny', 'pathetic', 'times.While', 'viewing', 'video', 'will', 'learn', 'plans', 'Badlanders', 'who', 'feel', 'outsiders', 'see', 'Simba', 'one', 'who', 'killed', 'Scar', 'leader', 'first', 'two', 'cubs', 'were', 'playing', 'around', 'water', 'being', 'chased', 'Crocodiles', 'realize', 'who', 'other', 'once', 'get', 'are', 'five', 'songs', 'Lion', 'King', 'II', 'Simba', 'Pride', 'drama', 'excitement', 'one', 'great', 'story', 'getting', 'along', 'letting', 'go', 'old', 'battle', 'scars.The', 'story', 'line', 'siblings', 'parents', 'young', 'ones', 'developing', 'relationships', 'Pride', 'Lands', 'silly', 'antics', 'Timon', 'Pumbaa.The', 'movie', 'will', 'lift', 'up', 'making', 'want', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'tap', 'feet', 'as', 'well', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat']",N/A

Roger""","[5, 6]","With Disney popping out sequal after sequal these days, it was only expected that they would do the same to their biggest animated hit.  The Lion King II picks up right where the original left us. Simba has what turns out to be a daughter, named Kiara and she is very couragous and rebellious, much like her father Simba was/is.  Everything would seem to be well but little do they know a revolt of another lion's pride is brewing. The pride known as the Outlanders is filled with lions and lionesses who were ousted by the Pride's Rock pride. Who want revenge for what happend to Scar and take their rightful place as the true rulers of the lands. They are lead by Zira, one of Scar's lionesses who wants nothing more then Simba's demise and for her adopted Son, Kovu to take his place. Zira trains Kovu to trick Simba into taking him in as one of their own and all the while Kira starts to fall in love with the newcomer. The story unfolds very nicely with a lot of twists and turns and great moments with characters both old and new showing up at various points.  A great ending that will really make people think and all around well written for a made to video movie.While this movie is great and just for the fact that we get to see what happens next with Simba and company, is well worth the price. But there are some unfortunate downsides to the movie.  Some of the songs are very weak and almost fast forward through them bad. That would be songs like Upendi which is sung by Rafiki and the stuff going on during that song is really reaching. &quot;Can you Feel the Love Tonight?&quot; it tries to be but fails miserably.  Opening title song though is wonderful and a lot of the songs you will recognize from the Broadway soundtrack so it really ties the whole Lion King Universe together.  Other things to note are Timon and Pumbaa are reduced to cameo moments at best which was disapointing. The charm and humor they brought into the first was truly missed. They have a few one liners and act more as babysitters to Kiara then anything. Great characters though are seen here like Vitani who plays Zira's daughter.  Kovu is also very well done and looks like a mixture of Simba and Scar all in one character. Last downside to note is the animation definitely is inferior in everyway. Yes its to be expected but its noticible in many points at how bad the animation for this movie is. Pride's Rock shifts sizes at points, the characters colors look flat and the brillient colors that once filled the Pride lands is almost a distant memory. Not so terrible that it takes away from the movie but it does make you wonder if they could have just spent a little more on making it look more colorful and full of life.Of course the movie isn't better then the first one. It is very hard to match the magic and overall wonderment that the first movie was but this does the job for a follow up quite well. We get to see what happens to our favorite characters after the first movie and meet some new friends and have a few more adventures and battles with a few songs mixed in. I don't see any problem with that.  If you are expecting another Lion King 1 then you may want to look elsewhere. But if you are expecting a great movie with your favorite characters in it, well this is the one for you. Definitely get it. It is a wonderful sequal and something that all ages will enjoy.

It eschews the  father-son relationship of Lion King and replaces it with a  community-community theme. Although there is also a father-daughter story  here, it is not as strong or powerful.Although there has been character  development with Pumba and Timon, apparently from their cartoon series on  the Disney Channel, most of the characters are not as well developed  (taking into consideration that many are extensions of characters in the  first movie).The music has much the same flavor -- the best songs are  the ones borrowed from the first movie. There are a few that work  otherwise.The animation is good -- again, nothing spectacular or  comparable to Lion King.Overall a good movie that any 5-10 year old  would enjoy.

However, there are only two sequels that I find surprisingly good: The Rescuers Down Under and this, The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride. Now, The Lion King was one of those Disney films that played a big part of my childhood. Actually, I think this is the one that I loved the most when I was a kid (along with the original Fantasia). So when I heard that there was going to be another Lion King four years later, I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know whether or not it would stink. I saw it at least twice now, and it's certainly not as great as the original, but it's not bad either. This is still a satisfying experience, and it was great to see the characters once again. The new characters (Kiara, Kovu, Zira, etc.) are really likable, though I do wish they didn't steal much of Simba and Nala's screen time. The songs aren't very memorable this time around, but they are still nice to listen to. And I don't mind the new voice for Zazu: if it at least sounds the same, then I'm not complaining.

Or could it be surpassed??? Ok, I will never say Lion King 2 is better, but as a stand alone movie, Lion King 2 is worth 20 bucks especially the special edition.  First things first, this is not a cheap low end animated movie as Disney tried to get away with in the past...Remember Aladdin 2, Return of Jafar?  The animation was horrible and the story was pretty weak.  Lion King 2 nearly lives up to the quality of it's predecessor.  Up front, this movie could have done very well in the theaters and I'm quite surprised it wasn't released to the big screen. But it's not so much the animation that kept me glued to it, it actually has an interesting story.  Most of the characters are back, although the voice of Simba (Matthew Broderic) seems different from the original, maybe he's just getting old, but anyway... Lion King 2 is basically a rehash of Simba's perils from the first movie, only this time it's his daugther taking the lead role in this one. Once again it also involes a love/hate story relationship between characters and it works very well.  Simba's role is actually quite small compared to his lead role in Lion King and one might be disappointed with that fact. The abnoxious  wart hog and ferret are back and funny as ever and they don't take away the seriousness of the movie, because it's actually adult themed.The music is well orchestrated too, and remastered in 5.1 dolby digital is good. The actual compositions are average at best, and I suppose I'm still spoiled by the original Lion King, but most of the singing you might want to fast forward. The special edition has a lot of neat additions, including the making of Lion King 2, the people involved, quizzes, trailers, music videos and more.All in all, I had no intention of getting this movie, but amazingly, it's a worthy successor of the Lion King. With the exception of the ""average"" song bytes, I enjoyed this movie.  There are some semi-violent scenes, but it's very tame compared to the perils in the Lion King.

It was a gorgeously animated film with an epic story, wonderful characters, beautiful/catchy songs, and some of the most majestic scenery to come out of a Disney film.  I owned and played with many of the toys from the film, listened to the soundtrack so many times I had it memorized, and to this day cannot watch ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"" without hearing the titular character as Simba.  In short, it's one of my favorite Disney films, second only to Pixar'sWall-E.  So imagine my skepticism when I learned the movie would be getting a sequel -- could a direct-to-video release even hope to hold a candle to the original?""The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride"" isn't as good as the original... but then, given how the original is held in such high esteem, it didn't stand much of a chance of topping its predecessor.  But it's still one of the best direct-to-video sequels of a Disney film, and does have strong points that elevate it above much of the direct-to-video dreck out there.""The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride"" picks up almost immediately where the first film leads off, with the presentation of Simba's newborn daughter to the denizens of the Pride Lands.  Kiara, princess of the Pride Lands, is a playful and curious cub who chafes under the watch of her overprotective father and bumbling babysitters Timon and Pumba, while Kovu, son of the leader of the Outlanders Zira, is one of the lions cast out from the Pridelands when they refused to renounce their loyalty to Scar.  The two end up befriending each other, and when they meet again as young adults they even fall in love... but Simba is suspicious of this outsider, and for good reason -- Zira has trained Kovu since cub-hood to kill Simba and take his place as King of Pride Rock.  Will the love between Kiara and Kovu be enough to bring peace to the Pride Lands, or will Zira's scheming tear them apart and destroy Kiara's family forever?Not being a theatrical release, this film's animation is a step or two below the original ""Lion King,"" which can be distracting at times.  The animation is slightly jerkier, and the few CGI effects (most notably the fire effects) aren't integrated as smoothly as in the original film.  The color palette doesn't seem as bright either, giving this film an oddly sepia look at times.  The animation's adequate enough for the job, I suppose, but still lackluster in comparison to the original.Most of the original voice cast returns for this film, which greatly helps -- nothing jars one out of a film faster than hearing an obvious replacement voice actor from a favorite character.  Not all the characters act the same in this film, however -- Simba has evolved from a mischievous cub/young lion to an overprotective father, and Nala, once a strong female character, is relegated to a few bit scenes.  Zazu's biting wit is gone, and he mostly serves as a Mr. Exposition in this film.  Timon and Pumba get quite a few scenes, mostly showcasing their wacky antics, and Rafiki still remains a favorite character -- he straddles the line between bumbling comic relief and half-mad wiseman, and somehow it works.  The new lead characters are fairly bland, though that's to be expected from a ""Romeo and Juliet"" plot, and of the Outlanders, Zira and Nuka stand out the most, the former for her scenery-chewing brand of gloating evil, and the latter for his bumbling antics as he tries (and fails) to prove he's just as badass as Kovu is made out to be.Probably the greatest strength of this film is the songs -- while not written by Elton John or Tim Rice, they're still memorable.

""Upendi"" seemed to be the film's attempt at a ""Hakuna Matata"" type of number, but it fell flat for me, and ""Love Will Find a Way,"" the films answer to ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight,"" was ultimately forgettable.Not a great film, but still one of the better Disney sequels outside of the ""Toy Story"" franchise.

This movie did stay true to the original My favorite part would definately have to be when Kiara and Kovu fall in love. This reminds me of Romeo and Juliet. In this situation Simba and his people are against Scar's people. And Kiara and Kovu's love is forbidden. What's really interesting is Kiara and Kovu's relationship flashbacks with Simba and Nala's love. Like the time when Kiara wasn't suppose to go to the Outlanders and father had to rescue her. She smile at him when he gave her a serious look. This reminds me when Simba did the same thing to his father when he got into trouble. The second one was when after Kovu rescued Kiara, Kiara got angry and Kovu began to follow her just to annoy her.....then Kovu said ""What are you doing""? which sounds very familiar to Kiara and then she begin to realize it's Kovu. This reminds me when in the original Nala found Simba with Timon and Pumba. They began to fight and Nala slammed Simba to the ground. That's when Simba realizes it's Nala. Boy, Kiara is just like her father. They have the same eyes. Kovu's bitchy mother and his siblings had wanted to kill Simba, but Kovu didn't want to be part of it. This shows that he may look scary and gothic on the outside, but truly he has a good heart on the inside. The best conclusion is how Simba's people and Scar's people united as one people. That was Mufasa's decision and the most wise one. I'm really glad that they put to the end to the fighting and just put the past behind. The writers did a wonderful, perfect job on this film!

To it's credit, this movie really tries to recapture the spirit of the original.

The returning characters are rather uninteresting; Simba has gone from the heroic young king to an neuroticlly overprotective parent, Nala is barely there, Zazu is no longer voiced by Rowan Atkinson and Raffiki is overused. The new characters, however- Kovu, Zira, Vitani and Nuka are very interesting, but pathetically underused. I think arbitrarily killing off Nuka and Zira was a mistake, they would have been very intriguing for the next sequel.

Being the rebellious cub that she is, Kiara wanders out of the Pride Lands and stumbles across Kovu, a cub from the wrong side of the tracks who just so happens to be the heir of Scar, the former movie's antagonist and Simba's deceased uncle. The two are separated by their respectful parents when it is discovered they've met, and subsequently they go several years without seeing one another. Years pass, and their paths cross once again, on the cusp of a rebellion between the Pride Landers and Outlanders, and they find that despite their bloodlines, they may be the only hope to repair the broken bond between their prides.I love the original, but I've always found myelf watching this one more, even as an adult. Some Disney films' ""big songs"" aren't always my favorite, but I'll tell you what, ""Upendi"" is one of my top ten favorite Disney songs. It's catchy, and a perfect song to show young ones that you can find love where you least expect it.The only problem I have is with the dvd release itself, not the movie. I purchased the original two disc special edition that was released in the early 2000's, as I always wanted to get it but I never did get the opportunity before it went into the Vault. I wanted to have the Virtual Safari most of all, so I would have all three. The first one? Great, best of them all. The third one? Really cute, loved the inclusion of Timon's family. But this one? This was, pardon, the most half-assed virtual tour I have ever seen on a dvd. The CGI was awful, and no matter what you choose, it seems to take you to the same endings and cutscenes. Most of the special features on this dvd are lacking, really. I did like the math game with the grubs, it's something cute someone can play with their child. I'm just glad they upped the ante for the prequel, the special features are much better.No matter the features, this movie is a great addition to any collection, and a definite must see for children who love Disney.",5,Great movie!

78858,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,0788805533,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 2]","Simba is now king of the Pridelands, and his little daughter Kiara is the light of his life. But Kiara craves freedom and to be seen as more than just a princess. Her independent spirit leads her to meet a male cub named Kovu, one of a group of banished lions that view the deceased villain Scar as a great martyr. Kovu is, in fact, the chosen one to the Outlanders, handpicked by Scar to be his successor. With all this known to Simba, he is intent on keeping the cubs apart, and as time passes, Kiara grows into a beautiful and strong lioness ready to prove herself, while Kovu grows into a powerful and dangerously brainwashed young lion taught by his mother, Zira, to hate Simba and his pride. Kovu has feelings of doubt though, and an inner wish to live a life without hatred. When he is reunited with grown-up Kiara, their blooming romance washes away his learned hatred and upsets Zira's plot to destroy Simba, only making things worse for the young lovers who just want the pride's dark past to be forgotten.So, that's the story of ""The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride"", and while I never intended to be the Disney direct-to-video defender guy, I do seem to play devil's advocate from time to time. It doesn't earn me much respect among my fellow artists or Disney fanatics, but, oh well. The fact is, some of Disney's direct-to-video releases were real gems. Yeah, some were awful, a lot were just okay, but a few were really great. The Lion King 2 was the first of the really great ones. Not the best of them, but a very good direct-to-video release. I mean, when you consider that it could have worked as a big screen release, and in some places it DID get such a release, that's pretty good for something of the direct-to-video line.The story is basically Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. That's appropriate, since the original Lion King was basically Shakespeare's Hamlet. Of course, doing something as serious and dramatic as Hamlet and following it with the slightly cheesy and overdone these days Romeo and Juliet, well, you're naturally going to have a picture that is less epic. The animation quality is nearly as good most of the time (not all the time, but most), but something else that hurts the film in comparison to the first is that less attention is given to the pure beauty of the music and visuals. One could easily fault most direct-to-video sequels for catering to a younger set by being more vocal and colorful, with more characters bouncing around all over the screen all the time and breaking into songs that stink compared to those in the original films, almost never having pure and quiet moments of emotion and beauty. ""Lion King 2"" is better than most direct-to-video sequels in that respect, but there is still a touch of the problem and it is what really makes the film look and feel different than the original, but not troublingly different. In general, it's still very good and works very well as a sequel, unlike some others that have had bad continuity or are just ridiculous. Some folks might make issue of the cub at the end of the original film looking like a male (and having a life of his own in a series of popular books released before this sequel), but most viewers will not even notice this.Elton John is missed from this sequel's soundtrack, but in general ""The Lion King 2"" has fantastic songs for a direct to video release, even making use of some of Lebo M's work from the first film's follow-up soundtrack, ""Rythym of the Pride Lands"". I only take issue with two songs from the film that give it that weak direct-to video quality: ""My Lullaby"" and ""One of Us"". My Lullaby is an okay scene, I just often find villain songs for direct-to-video releases to be rather clunky, and this one is no exception. As usual though, the voice performer (in this case, Disney alumnus Suzanne Pleshette), gives it their all nevertheless. More troublesome for me is ""One of Us"", which is an okay enough song but starts out terribly to me and I really don't care for how the animals, zebras, giraffes, etc..., are the singers... It just comes off silly and very direct to video. That is the one scene in this film that is very direct-to-video to me. The rest, even ""My Lullaby"" for the most part, is scores above what I ever would have hoped for from the medium at the time and still holds up very well.Oh, and before I forget, one of the great original songs in ""Lion King 2"" is called ""Upendi"" and sung by Rafiki. Here's a fun game for immature adults watching the film. Sing along during this scene, but instead of ""Upendi"", replace that word with ""your panties"". I know, sounds dumb, but it is hilarious how well it fits if you have a twisted mind.Where was I? Ah, yes, back to the film, one of its strongest points, though a less unusual one, is that much of the voice cast of the original film returns. Zazu, whose role is small, is adequately replaced and some characters do not appear (like Sarabi). Of course, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella return as Timon and Pubaa, and it's great to hear the original voices of Simba and Nala return, Matthew Broderick and Moira Kelly, no to mention Robert Guillaume as Rafiki. The new characters, which are also pretty good, boast a great voice cast as well, like Neve Campbell as Kiara, Jason Marsden as Kovu, Suzanne Pleshette as Zira, Andy Dick as his sniveling, jealous big brother Nuka, Jennifer Lien as sister Vitani and Lacey Chabert as the young Vitani, among others.Though it's not the dramatic, epic masterpiece the original ""Lion King"" was, ""Lion King 2: Simba's Pride"" delivers its share of drama, romance, comedy, fun, and adventure as well, and within the realm of direct-to-video, it's a worthy and appreciated follow-up to the beloved classic. The story is solid and consistently entertaining. The characters are excellent and the music for the most part is too. The visuals may be a notch below the original, but not by much. Some folks simply will not accept a direct-to-video sequel to an animated classic, but this is one of those cases where they'd be missing out. I highly recommend ""The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride"", and for those who enjoy it, I also recommend ""The Lion King 1 1/2"", ""Mulan 2"", ""Lilo and Stitch 2"", Tarzan 2"", ""Bambi 2"", ""101 Dalmatians 2"", and ""An Extremely Goofy Movie"", which are among the best of Disney's direct-to-video sequel offerings, though a few other titles are just as good, like ""Mickey, Donald, and Goofy, the Three Musketeers"", ""Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas"" and ""Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas"".As for the DVD itself, 1998's ""The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride was rereleased in 2004 in a 2-disc Special Edition with a book-style slip-cover. The anamorphic widescreen transfer looks and sounds fantastic. Disc one doesn't have much for extras. There's a pop-up ""Matter of Facts"" version of the film you can watch if you want a lot of animal facts and things like that to pop-up as you view the film (you may want to change the audio during this, or else suffer through annoying sound effects whenever a pop-up appears), and there's direct access to the songs in a sort of sing-along-song form. Disc 2 is where the worthy bonus features are, though there aren't a lot of them there either. The best one is undoubtedly the short, ""One of Us"", originally intended for the canceled ""Fantasia 2006"". It takes another Lebo M song from the ""Rythym of the Pride Lands"" album (a great album that I need to upgrade from cassette to CD myself...) and sets it to traditional animation about a group of African children inspired to share a day of kite flying. As always, it's great to see new traditional animation from Disney, and this short is carefree and lovely to watch, reminiscent in a way to oldschool Disney stuff like ""All the Cats Join In"". The other great Bonus Feature is the very brief behind-the-scenes look at the film, ""Proud of Simba's Pride"". Short, but the kind of thing Disney DVD collectors wish they would get more of (in a longer presentation of course). A music video for the end credits song, ""Love Will Find a Way"" (performed by Heather Headley and Kenny Lattimore), is also included on disc 2, as it should be. Let's face it, music videos, theatrical trailers, and at least one behind the scenes look should be standard on all DVDs. Sadly, the trailer for Lion King 2 is one thing from the previous DVD that was not ported over to this newer release.Besides those excellent but few bonus features, we also get another Virtual Safari (though I found the ones on Lion King and Lion King 1 1/2 to be better), a coconut shell game, and a game on shapes and counting. Frankly, the only games I like on DVDs are trivia games with video prizes at the end, like on some of the old Disney Gold Collection releases. Two other bonus features remain to be mentioned: Lots About Lions, an informative bit about the big cats narrated by Timon and Pumbaa, and ""Find Out Why"", a collection of 5 very short shorts in which Timon and Pubaa educate us on behalf of the National Science Foundation. I actually am very glad for the inclusion of the ""Find Out Why"" shorts. They were entertaining and I'd never seen them before. I find myself wondering what they were created for. Perhaps they aired on Toon Disney, a network I never received, though I could see them being quite at home somewhere in EPCOT Center on a video screen.Overall, it seems this 2-disc edition of Lion King 2 should have had a lot more to warrant the second disc, but it is still a must-own for the great feature and the only DVD release of the short ""One by One"". If you don't have this film yet, get it, and if you only have the original release, upgrade. The film looks better than ever and some of the very few extras are gems. ""The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride"": If only Disney had made sure all their direct-to-video sequels were on this level, even a few they decided to release to theaters.",5,"Not perfect, but still an

78868,A29L2RN5D8C0HM,0788805533,"Prism Light ""Prism""","[1, 2]","Simba's daughter can be described in one word: Rebellious.  That seems to be the theme of Disney sequels these days...the main character's daughter/son (Usually daughter) is a rebellious adventurer who wants nothing more then to break away from the character we loved so much in the original movie.  I personally find that plot to be over-used and a first-movie-ruiner.  It's hard to feel the same about the original movie when the second movie is such a bummer.This movie was okay, not great.  It was definately more violent and evil in some parts then the original The Lion King.  Although Kiara was possibly a prettier lion then Nala, I found her to be slightly too emotional, and I didn't like that she was always trying to get away from, and take control of, almost everyone's favorite character, Simba.

The songs are strange, the characters are melancholy and mainly flat (including Andy Dick, who is a very disturbing, unloved lion in the opposing pride), and the plot line is confusing.It is supposed to be taking place after Simba's cub has grown up, into Kiara, a rebellious young lioness. She ends up meeting Kovu, a lion raised to hate Simba's pride by the opposing pride who lives on the outlands. The story behind them is that they were the lionesses supporting Scar (although I never saw one lioness fighting AGAINST Simba in first the movie) and were banished for it. Kovu is, apparently, not Scar's child, but he looks exactly like him. He and Kiara end up finding common ground, much to the anger of both of their parents.""We Are One"" which is sung by Simba, along with the opening ""He lives in you"" are the only good songs.

With lower quality animation, weak retreads of the original story, replacements in the celebrity voice talent and new songs leaving much to desire, they usually aren't even worth a rental. But The Lion King II is definitely worth at least a rental.Perhaps it was because of the films major success as the highest grossing animated film of all time, but somehow when it came time to make Simba's Pride, the producers put a little extra effort into it.The animation is close to the original's quality. Crisp beautiful colors saturate the African landscape and much of the fire is computer animated. It's obvious the animators took their time to make it a beautiful looking film.Also, it avoided another common fall of the direct-to-video market: almost all of the voice talent returns. Even James Earl Jones supplies a few lines as Mufasa.The story, though very similar to the original, is fitting and has enough twists to seem fresh. This is the story of Simba's daughter, not Simba. Sure this is definitely an unnecessary sequel, but as far as unnecessary sequels, this one holds its own.If there was one major failing of this film, it's that the new songs are pretty pathetic. Compared to the original songs by Elton John and company, these ones lack their emotion and catchiness. The opening song is beautiful, but it is lifted from a ""songs inspired by the Lion King"" album released just after the original film came out. Fortunately, the film manages not to re-use songs from the original film, which always feels like a cop-out.Also, there are just a few times in the film where the pacing feels rushed. Compared to other direct-to-video films, this is much better in the pacing department, but there are still a few minor problems. Mostly nit-picks.Overall, this one is the exception to the Disney video sequel rule. Unfortunately the songs still left a bad taste in my mouth, bad enough to give it only 3 stars.

78874,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,0788805533,Robert J. Schneider,"[65, 70]","Yeah, I know that this direct-to-video sequel was put out to cash in even more so on the original, which itself grossed over $300 in U.S. box office receipts to become the most successful Disney film ever! However, after watching this a couple of years back and revisiting it today, I know that there was another, much better, reason: four years after THE LION KING, we were all missing the characters...and we were hungry for more. As much as us fans of the original did not want the possibility of having the franchise tainted by an inferior sequel, it seemed to be worth the risk.And it was. In 1998, Disney got most of the principal voice-over actors back from the original---Matthew Broderick as Simba, Moira Kelly as Nala, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon &amp; Pumbaa, respectively, and of course, Robert Guillaume as the hilarious Rafiki---and made THE LION KING II: SIMBA'S PRIDE, which follows our favorite Lion hero (and King) &amp; family as they pick up from where they left off in the first film. Now Simba is the King and his young offspring is a lioness cub named Kiara; he's the worried dad in this one, always fearing for the safety of the young precocious girl, but they're nevertheless a happy family just the same. Of course, danger lurks in the shadows, as Zira (Suzanne Pleshette---yes, *that* Suzanne Pleshette), the villainous ex-mate of Scar, is training her young son Kovu to grow up to avenge Scar's death by killing Simba. However, Rafiki, the silly-acting but nevertheless wise monkey, finds out to his horrified amazement that Kiara and Kovu are destined for each other. Sure enough, Kiara and Kovu meet each other as cubs and take an immediate strong liking to each other. Can true love overcome true evil?This film, by itself, is very well-written and acted, with excellent production values for the fact that it is a direct-to-video sequel. It has really no flaws of its own, just one obvious inconsistency between it and the first film: Scar's 'ex-mate' Zira (and, by extension, Kovu) simply did not exist in the original THE LION KING! She was obviously made up just to have a sequel. However, this is the only major thing to overlook, and if you can forgive this movie for it, then you should be able to easily enjoy yourself. As I said, this is a good animated movie, and I recommend it for any fan of the original. This sequel isn't quite as dark; however, I still would not recommend showing it to very young kids. Suzanne Pleshette does a surprisingly good job as the evil, scheming, vengeful Zira (basically a female versdion of old Scar himself). Neve Campbell does a solid job as the voice of the adult Kiara, and Jason Marsden does excellently as the conflicted Kovu, who wants to do good, but...he made a promise to his mother...didn't he?!Listen, THE LION KING II: SIMBA'S PRIDE is not the masterpiece that THE LION KING is...however, it is much better than it perhaps should be.

Most decide to skip any form of Disney sequal as most of them are downright awful and a waste of money (such as Stitch the Movie...I bought it for my love of the character Stitch & the fact that it was $3), but this one ends up being quite rewarding.I only gave this film 3 stars (the movie itself deserves a 4) due to the shameful extras on here. I always get excited for the Virtual Safari extra, but this one was not as unique as the ones given on Lion King & Lion King 1 & 1/2. However I did enjoy the animated short ""One By One,"" which contains excellent animation and is just plain fun to watch! The rest of the extras are very kiddie-ish and are mainly trivia and facts for your little ones to enjoy and play around with. I feel there should be more adult-oriented bonuses (maybe along the lines of animation proceedures or the film's score, as the ""Proud of Simba's Pride"" featurette only lightly scratched this surface, but is a unique addition to see the faces of the voices behind the fresh characters) since this film has such a dark side to it.I love this film for it's new set of characters and the fact that it contains the old favorites with the original voice cast. Out of the newbie characters, I mainly love Jason Marsden (as older Kovu), Andy Dick (as the dark comedic Nuka, almost a replacement for the hyena trio...or just Ed) and of course the fresh new villain Suzanne Pleshette (playing Zira, the replacement for Scar...and believe me, she is a wonderful villain!).I even found the music satisfying, as the songs are unique, but do not come into this expecting ""Circle of Life"" or ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight,"" as the songs from the original are pretty hard to compete with.

78889,A1W68QUF8TLJ98,0788805533,"T. Callahan ""*Um...A Signature?*""","[3, 5]","Let's face it, The Lion King is a Disney masterpiece, and from the very begining a sequel was inevitable, even more inevitable was the major let down that would go along with it.  The fans knew this, the studio knew this, veryone knew this, but was a sequel was going to be made wether we liked it or not, most of us didn't.  The Lion King is just too good a movie to top or even equal, let's just get that out of the way from the get go.That being said, The Lion King II - Simba's Pride isn't that bad of a DTV.  I mean, it's still pretty bad by Feature Film standards/Lion King Standards, but it holds it's own as far as DTV Disney Sequels are concerned, which, if you're as familiar with them as most of us are, have a long track record of being pretty terrible.Like it's predacessor, The Lion King II follows a loose Shakespearen outline, this time it's Romeo and Juiliet, making for an ultimately more predictable story, though with a good message that kids will find easily accesible - Love conquers and eventual unites all.This time instead of a cocky yet loveable Simba, we have Kiara, Simba and Nala's little duaghter, a hyperactive lion cub with ADHD, who for some reason or another thinks being the Queen is ""No Fun"", although we the audience really get no action to back this theory up.  And instead of a smart, whole lotta woman Nala accenting Kiara's, well, syndrome, we have... Uh, no one really, just Timon and Pumbaa in a pianfully larger, surprisingly less funny role as her ""bodyguards"" asigned by the over protectice King Simba, who in this film, talks like a Native American sterotype.  But, that's beyond the point.  Our fair Kira soon meets Kovu, a cub borned to the outsiders banished by Simba, whom although all the other characters stress teh fact that he is indeed NOT Scars actuall son, HAS been chosen to one day kill Simba and follow in Scars paw prints as the rightful king.  Add into the mix Zira, Scars revenge hungry ex wife, and a complicated ""No one understands"" love story between Kiara and Kovu, and you've got, well a daytime soap but with Lions.  Or the Lion King II, you decide.I suppose the main problem with this film is it's over ambition.  I mean, seriously, The Lion King II is driving a beat up old station wagon  all the way from Cleveland to Des Moines on a half a tank of gas, and all those plot holes in the road aren't making things any easier.  The story really could have been better had they paced themselves a little better, been more daring with the whole Romeo and Juliet inspiration, and paid a bit more attention to the score and plot holes, and some character development wouldn't hurt!But other then that ( alot I guess) the story is more involved then other DTV's, which is comeandable, and it's good to the see the studio taking what chances it did.  To tell you the truth, I'd much rather sit and watch 80 minutes of feuding pirdes and struggling lovers, then 75 minutes of The Tramps son learningthat home is where the heart is through a series of meaningless ""adventures"".That being said, we have a great cast which brings a little bit to the basically dead material.  Almost everyone returns from the original, save Rowan Atinkinsonn as Zazu (A Major loss), hell, even james Earl Jones makes an appearance!  New comers include Suzana Pleshette as the deliciously evil Zira, and Andy Dick as the demented, attention starved Nuka, whose touching death scene sums him up perfectly, adding a hint of dimesnion to Zira's otherwise flat characterization.  It's just too bad she was robbed of her disturbing, humanizing suicide scene into the rivean.The animation is more pleasing then past DTv efforts, but the score is basically Rhytm of the Pirdelands Throw aways, save Zira's ""My Lullaby"", possibly the only good song in the score.I can't really say how kids will react to this dud, but in my oppinion, you'd be better off skipping this lead balloon, and popping the original in the old DVD player, sitting down with the kids, and hailing to the true king.",3,With a little more effort you could of had a pizza trophy,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,4021,"['Let', 'face', 'Lion', 'King', 'Disney', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'begining', 'sequel', 'was', 'inevitable', 'even', 'more', 'inevitable', 'was', 'major', 'let', 'down', 'would', 'go', 'fans', 'knew', 'studio', 'knew', 'veryone', 'knew', 'was', 'sequel', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'liked', 'not', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'Lion', 'King', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'movie', 'top', 'even', 'equal', 'let', 'just', 'get', 'way', 'get', 'go.That', 'being', 'said', 'Lion', 'King', 'II', 'Simba', 'Pride', ""n't"", 'bad', 'DTV', 'mean', 'still', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Feature', 'Film', 'standards/Lion', 'King', 'Standards', 'own', 'as', 'far', 'DTV', 'Disney', 'Sequels', 'are', 'concerned', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'most', 'are', 'have', 'long', 'track', 'record', 'being', 'pretty', 'predacessor', 'Lion', 'King', 'II', 'loose', 'Shakespearen', 'outline', 'time', 'Romeo', 'Juiliet', 'making', 'ultimately', 'more', 'predictable', 'story', 'good', 'message', 'kids', 'will', 'find', 'easily', 'accesible', 'Love', 'conquers', 'eventual', 'unites', 'all.This', 'time', 'instead', 'cocky', 'yet', 'loveable', 'Simba', 'have', 'Kiara', 'Simba', 'Nala', 'little', 'duaghter', 'hyperactive', 'lion', 'cub', 'ADHD', 'who', 'reason', 'thinks', 'being', 'Queen', 'Fun', 'audience', 'really', 'get', 'action', 'back', 'theory', 'up', 'instead', 'smart', 'whole', 'lotta', 'woman', 'Nala', 'accenting', 'Kiara', 'well', 'syndrome', 'have', 'Uh', 'one', 'really', 'just', 'Timon', 'Pumbaa', 'pianfully', 'larger', 'surprisingly', 'less', 'funny', 'role', 'bodyguards', 'asigned', 'over', 'protectice', 'King', 'Simba', 'who', 'film', 'talks', 'Native', 'American', 'sterotype', 'point', 'fair', 'Kira', 'soon', 'Kovu', 'cub', 'borned', 'outsiders', 'banished', 'Simba', 'whom', 'other', 'characters', 'stress', 'teh', 'fact', 'indeed', 'NOT', 'Scars', 'actuall', 'son', 'HAS', 'been', 'chosen', 'one', 'day', 'kill', 'Simba', 'follow', 'Scars', 'paw', 'prints', 'rightful', 'king', 'Add', 'mix', 'Zira', 'Scars', 'revenge', 'hungry', 'ex', 'wife', 'complicated', 'one', 'love', 'story', 'Kiara', 'Kovu', ""'ve"", 'got', 'well', 'daytime', 'soap', 'Lions', 'Lion', 'King', 'II', 'decide.I', 'suppose', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'ambition', 'mean', 'seriously', 'Lion', 'King', 'II', 'driving', 'beat', 'up', 'old', 'station', 'wagon', 'way', 'Cleveland', 'Des', 'Moines', 'half', 'tank', 'gas', 'plot', 'holes', 'road', 'are', ""n't"", 'making', 'things', 'easier', 'story', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'paced', 'little', 'better', 'been', 'more', 'daring', 'whole', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'inspiration', 'paid', 'bit', 'more', 'attention', 'score', 'plot', 'holes', 'character', 'development', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'other', 'then', 'alot', 'guess', 'story', 'more', 'involved', 'then', 'other', 'DTV', 'comeandable', 'good', 'see', 'studio', 'taking', 'what', 'did', 'tell', 'truth', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'sit', 'watch', '80', 'minutes', 'feuding', 'pirdes', 'struggling', 'lovers', 'then', '75', 'minutes', 'Tramps', 'son', 'learningthat', 'home', 'where', 'heart', 'series', 'meaningless', 'adventures', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'great', 'cast', 'little', 'bit', 'basically', 'dead', 'material', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'returns', 'original', 'save', 'Rowan', 'Atinkinsonn', 'Zazu', 'A', 'Major', 'loss', 'hell', 'even', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'appearance', 'New', 'comers', 'include', 'Suzana', 'Pleshette', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'Zira', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'demented', 'attention', 'starved', 'Nuka', 'touching', 'death', 'scene', 'sums', 'up', 'perfectly', 'adding', 'hint', 'dimesnion', 'Zira', 'otherwise', 'flat', 'characterization', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'robbed', 'disturbing', 'humanizing', 'suicide', 'scene', 'rivean.The', 'animation', 'more', 'pleasing', 'then', 'DTv', 'efforts', 'score', 'basically', 'Rhytm', 'Pirdelands', 'Throw', 'save', 'Zira', 'Lullaby', 'possibly', 'only', 'good', 'song', 'score.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'how', 'kids', 'will', 'react', 'dud', 'oppinion', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'skipping', 'lead', 'balloon', 'popping', 'original', 'old', 'DVD', 'player', 'sitting', 'down', 'kids', 'hailing', 'true', 'king']",N/A

The lions have had a terrible division, with one pride being banished from the Pride land to the outer region.  Simba has taught the upcoming generation to be wary of these outsiders.  They are dangerous, violent--even deadly.  Meanwhile, the Queen-Mother of the outsiders has nurtured murderous hatred in her young.  She hopes that her stronger, more deserving progeny can regain leadership that was snatched from them.

Unlike most other sequals this wasn't made too much longer after the first so retains most of the original voices. The plot is also somewhat related to the first--The Lion King being loosely based on Hamlet and this one being loosely based on Romeo and Juliet.
