It is not so here. The movie  is dry and the pace is so slow. The production value is cheap. Despite the presence of an internationally popular star at that time, Bronson just could not carry this one. It amazes me that the director associated with films like The Magnificent Seven and The Gunfight at the OK Corral could come up with something bad as this one. But the trend was already there when he directed Joe Kidd with Clint Eastwood. That was bad. This was worse. The DVD picture is bad and hazy. It seems that this was taken from an old and badly copied VHS and transferred to DVD. Shades of the old MC Clintok DVD from Goodtime Video. Don't waste your money on this one.

So now you've been updated.As for the film itself, this is one of Bronson's more cerebral films. There is some action here and there to be sure, but this moves at a slower pace than most of his films. The production is European (French, Italian, Spanish) and most of the crew is from Italy so this has a very different feel than westerns produced in the U.S. Many people have said this is Bronson's spaghetti western.

More Importantly, ""Chino"" lacks the typical comic book tone and one-dimensional/amoral protagonists of most Italian Westerns, e.g. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" On the contrary, ""Chino"" is ultra-realistic and features flesh & blood protagonists.THE PLOT: Chino Valdez (Charles Bronson), a half-breed, runs a horse farm in the desert and is usually persecuted when he goes to town. A 15 year-old runaway named Jamie drops by and Chino decides to hire him. Meanwhile, a neighboring rancher is starting to fence-up the wilderness and Chino falls for his beautiful half-sister (Jill Ireland).I stayed away from ""Chino"" all these years because I was told that it was a slow, lackluster and uneventful Bronson Western. Well, it might be sort of slow, since the story focuses on the characters and their drama, but it's not lackluster or uneventful. I was surprised at how good it is. The theme is the dying of the Old West and everything that went with it. Big time ranchers are moving in and fencing-off the land and Native Americans are becoming extinct across the landscape, except for Reservations. Being a half-breed, Chino seems to stir-up trouble wherever he goes through no fault of his own, which results in a saloon fight here and there. Thankfully, Jamie is too young to be bigoted and they develop a sort of father/son relationship.If you enjoy horses you'll love ""Chino."" It features the running of a herd in open pasture, cameos of a magnificent stallion, the birthing of a foal and its life with Chino & Jamie, the bareback riding of a group of Natives, Chino's great drive of some horses into town and an unexpected horse mating scene. Fittingly, that last one is the set-up for Chino making the moves on his woman, lol.There's also a fairly long Native American sequence where Chino introduces Jamie to the band of Indians that are basically his family. There's a sleeping-in-the-tepee scene that's reminiscent of a similar scene in ""Dances with Wolves,"" which came out 17 years later. Also, as Chino entertains the idea of hooking-up with a sexy squaw Jamies meets a sweet young thang.Unfortunately the story didn't end the way I would've liked it to end; it left a sour taste. But then I reflected on the movie and accepted it. In view of the film's main theme -- the twilight of the Old West -- I suppose it ended the way it had to. Besides, not every story ends on a ""everyone lived happily ever after"" note.In any event, ""Chino"" breaches the ceiling of greatness as a simple, yet compelling drama that takes place in the soon-to-be-gone Old West.The film runs 98 minutes.GRADE: A-",5,A potential beautiful family,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,2848,"['Italian/Spanish/French', 'production', 'shot', 'Spain', 'Chino', '1973', ""n't"", 'genuine', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'account', 'director', 'John', 'Sturges', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'being', 'American', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'film', 'Duilio', 'Colett', 'did', 'More', 'Importantly', 'Chino', 'typical', 'comic', 'book', 'tone', 'one-dimensional/amoral', 'protagonists', 'most', 'Italian', 'Westerns', 'e.g', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'contrary', 'Chino', 'ultra-realistic', 'features', 'flesh', 'blood', 'protagonists.THE', 'PLOT', 'Chino', 'Valdez', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'half-breed', 'horse', 'farm', 'desert', 'usually', 'persecuted', 'when', 'town', '15', 'year-old', 'runaway', 'named', 'Jamie', 'drops', 'Chino', 'hire', 'Meanwhile', 'neighboring', 'rancher', 'starting', 'fence-up', 'wilderness', 'Chino', 'beautiful', 'half-sister', 'Jill', 'Ireland', '.I', 'stayed', 'away', 'Chino', 'years', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'slow', 'lackluster', 'uneventful', 'Bronson', 'Western', 'Well', 'might', 'be', 'sort', 'slow', 'story', 'characters', 'drama', 'not', 'lackluster', 'uneventful', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'theme', 'dying', 'Old', 'West', 'everything', 'went', 'Big', 'time', 'ranchers', 'are', 'moving', 'fencing-off', 'land', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'becoming', 'extinct', 'landscape', 'Reservations', 'Being', 'half-breed', 'Chino', 'stir-up', 'trouble', 'fault', 'own', 'results', 'saloon', 'fight', 'here', 'there', 'Thankfully', 'Jamie', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'bigoted', 'develop', 'sort', 'father/son', 'relationship.If', 'enjoy', 'horses', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Chino', 'running', 'herd', 'open', 'pasture', 'cameos', 'magnificent', 'stallion', 'birthing', 'foal', 'life', 'Chino', 'Jamie', 'bareback', 'riding', 'group', 'Natives', 'Chino', 'great', 'drive', 'horses', 'town', 'unexpected', 'horse', 'mating', 'scene', 'Fittingly', 'last', 'one', 'set-up', 'Chino', 'making', 'moves', 'woman', 'also', 'fairly', 'long', 'Native', 'American', 'sequence', 'where', 'Chino', 'Jamie', 'band', 'Indians', 'are', 'basically', 'family', 'sleeping-in-the-tepee', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'similar', 'scene', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'came', 'out', '17', 'years', 'later', 'Also', 'Chino', 'idea', 'hooking-up', 'sexy', 'squaw', 'Jamies', 'sweet', 'young', 'thang.Unfortunately', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'end', 'left', 'sour', 'taste', 'then', 'reflected', 'movie', 'accepted', 'view', 'film', 'main', 'theme', 'twilight', 'Old', 'West', 'suppose', 'ended', 'way', 'had', 'Besides', 'not', 'story', 'everyone', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'note.In', 'event', 'Chino', 'ceiling', 'greatness', 'simple', 'yet', 'compelling', 'drama', 'place', 'soon-to-be-gone', 'Old', 'West.The', 'film', '98', 'minutes.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
