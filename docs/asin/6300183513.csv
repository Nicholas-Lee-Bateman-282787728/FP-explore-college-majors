203500,A1NOLEWY3EBW01,6300183513,683,"[3, 4]","Out of all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, this is definitely my favorite next to a few others. This film sticks out so much because everything is perfect. The acting, the actors (James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr), the Edith Head costumes, the music, the sharp dialouge, the terrifying ending, and of course, suspense like no other. Everything about the film is absolutely perfect, and I think it's one of the greatest suspense films ever made. This movie is what Hitchcock would call ""pure cinema"".The film is about a photographer named L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, who broke his leg in an accident and, while confined in his apartment, has nothing else to do but stare out his window and look into other people's apartment rooms. Later on, he suspects that his neighbor right in front of his apartment building, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), murdered his invalid wife. Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont, who helps Jeff investigate the murder, along with his homecare nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), who provides the typical Hitchcock comic relief in the film. Wendell Corey plays Detective Tom Doyle, who is skeptical about the whole murder theory.This film has the perfect amount of suspense, and even though it takes place all in one room, it's still so suspenseful. It gradually builds up scene after scene all the way to the shattering conclusion, that you'll think about way after the movie is over. This is an ultimate Hitchcock masterpiece, along with some others, like ""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"", and ""The Birds"".The Universal Legacy Series edition of this film is absolutely phenomenal. The film does look pretty grainy, but other than that, it looks beautiful. The Disc 1 comes with the film (of course), a commentary by John Powell, production notes and photographs, along with the theatrical trailer and the re-release trailer. The Disc 2 comes with a 55 minute documentary ""Rear Window Ethics: An Original Documentary"". It talks about how the film was made, and it's extremely interesting. It also comes with a 15-20 minute interview, titled ""A Conversation With Screenwriter John Michael Hayes"", a very interesting 25 minute documentary about Hitchcock's films ""Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master"", with different directors talking about his films, a very similar 25 minute documentary about the music in Hitch's films, ""Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock"", a 15-minute Hitchcock/Truffaut excerpt with Hitch talking about ""Rear Window"", alongside showing parts from the film and some photots, and it also comes with an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, titled ""Mr. Blanchard's Secret"", which has a very similar plot to ""Rear Window"" (somebody believing their next door neighbor is a spousal murderer.Altogether, if you don't own ""Rear Window"", the Universal Legacy Series edition is the version to get! It has great special features, along with an amazing packaging, and of course, a breathtaking masterpiece of a film. ""Now where do ya suppose he cut her up? Of course! The bathtub! That's the only way he coulda washed away all the blood!"" (My favorite quote from the movie!)",5,"My favorite Alfred Hitchcock film!

Did Raymond Burr kill his wife and chop her up with saw and knife? That's the impression injured Jimmy Stewart got from peeping through the windows. We had to throw in some subplots and have some fun as well, because of the length, and it's excellent in doing that.

203502,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,6300183513,A Customer,"[2, 7]","A bit slow at times, but classic Hitchock.Summary:L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photographer who broke his leg getting an exciting picture for his magazine.  As a result he has been stuck in his apartment for 7 weeks getting better and has one more to go.  He is dating Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) but he doesn't want to marry her and he doesn't want to change his life to adapt to what married life would be like.When Jeff believes his neighbor, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), killed his wife, Mrs. Anna Thorwald (Irene Winston), he begins an intrigue that sucks in Lisa and several others and only ends when Lars comes into Jeff's apartment and nearly kills him.My Comments:Either it is me aging or Hitchcock aging, but Hitchcock seems to get better the older I get.  The movie was fun to watch and the acting was pretty good.  Jeff's nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) was also a lot of fun, offering the wisdom of a wise woman's life in the time it takes to rub a man's back.  The set was brilliant (the entire story takes place in an a group of apartments).  And, perhaps best of all were the relationships that played out between the cast members.  There was love and loss and loneliness and rejection.  It was all there.I never really felt any tension in the movie, but then again that could have been because there were moments when it was slow and I just didn't identify all that well with the characters.  But the film was very enjoyable nonetheless.  Great Hitchcock.  Also, the DVD special features were very informative and included interviews with most of the cast.",3,"A bit slow at times, but classic Hitchock.",1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,1589,"['bit', 'slow', 'times', 'classic', 'Hitchock.Summary', 'L.B', 'Jeffries', 'James', 'Stewart', 'photographer', 'who', 'broke', 'leg', 'getting', 'exciting', 'picture', 'magazine', 'result', 'been', 'stuck', 'apartment', '7', 'weeks', 'getting', 'better', 'one', 'more', 'go', 'dating', 'Lisa', 'Carol', 'Fremont', 'Grace', 'Kelly', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', ""n't"", 'want', 'change', 'life', 'adapt', 'what', 'married', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'like.When', 'Jeff', 'neighbor', 'Lars', 'Thorwald', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'killed', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Anna', 'Thorwald', 'Irene', 'Winston', 'intrigue', 'Lisa', 'several', 'others', 'only', 'when', 'Lars', 'Jeff', 'apartment', 'nearly', 'kills', 'him.My', 'Comments', 'aging', 'Hitchcock', 'aging', 'Hitchcock', 'get', 'better', 'older', 'get', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Jeff', 'nurse', 'Stella', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'offering', 'wisdom', 'wise', 'woman', 'life', 'time', 'rub', 'man', 'back', 'set', 'was', 'brilliant', 'entire', 'story', 'place', 'group', 'apartments', 'perhaps', 'best', 'were', 'relationships', 'played', 'out', 'cast', 'members', 'was', 'love', 'loss', 'loneliness', 'rejection', 'was', 'there.I', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'tension', 'movie', 'then', 'again', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'was', 'slow', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'identify', 'well', 'characters', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'nonetheless', 'Great', 'Hitchcock', 'Also', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'very', 'informative', 'included', 'interviews', 'most', 'cast']",Rear Window VHS

That's it.This has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it on NBC in the 60s, and when I saw the restored version last year in Seattle, the animated, standing-room-only crowd went from a gasp (as Burr looked down) to an outright shriek (when he looked up).

203504,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300183513,Acute Observer,"[2, 10]","This 1954 film is taken from a short story by Cornell Woolrich. The opening shows apartment houses in Greenwich Village and the people who live there. It is 90F and people are sweating it out. [Crime goes up with the temperature.] L. B. Jeffries is a graying photographer laid up with a broken leg. His apartment overlooks the windows of other apartments, the adults there and in the courtyard. A woman comes over to give him a massage. His girl friend is from Park Avenue. The lighting in the apartments allows viewing into the rooms. Lisa Carol Fremont is quite well-dressed and brings along a fancy take-out meal. Lisa wants to domesticate LBJ, to get him to settle down and quite foreign travel. But LBJ loves his career as a news photographer (can he look into his future?). Lisa is an upper-class lady who is happy in her niche.At night LBJ sees a man from across the courtyard making many trips at night carrying a suitcase. He views the apartment with binoculars, then with a long-lens SLR camera. At times you hear children, but see none. LBJ is more interested in the man across the courtyard than in luscious Lisa, and this upsets Lisa. What happened to Thorwald's wife? [Decomposition would be rapid in the 90F heat.] LBJ seems cranky from being stuck in his room for the past 7 weeks. Lisa says Mrs. Thorwald would not have left her favorite purse and jewelry behind. Lt. Tom Doyle warns against imagining things, he checked out the shipped trunk. [No search warrant needed?] The death of a pet dog is ominous. Only one person didn't come out to look!The amateurs continue to snoop into Thorwald's life. They wonder if something was buried in the back yard. Lisa enters Thorwald's apartment, is found, but the police take her away. LBJ answers the phone without saying ""hello"" and talks too much. There is a suspenseful series of heavy footsteps (believable?), then Thorwald enters the room. Can flashbulbs stop a murderer? The police arrive in time.The temperature drops to 70F. We see what happened to the others across the courtyard. The success of this film tells much about popular taste in those times. It is basically a short story that is padded out to make a long story. I would not rate it among the top Hitchcock films. ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and ""North by Northwest"" were better remakes of earlier films. Such snooping about neighbors is a feature of small-town life, unlike the anonymity of a big city. But some could call this concerns of small-town life friendliness or caring.

203505,A2S166WSCFIFP5,6300183513,"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com""","[13, 15]","Rear Window is one of the classic Hitchcock films, made in the latter part of his career, where he could almost do no wrong. It ranks up there with Psycho, The Birds, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and in my opinion the only movie of Hitch's that is better than Rear Window is North By Northwest. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly give one of their better performances. The action in this movie takes place in Stewart's apartment or viewed from his apartment. Stewart plays a photographer who has broken his leg and is pretty much immobile (the cast is from the pelvis to foot) and witnesses what he suspects to be a murder. The film can be truly horrifying. Imagine what it would be like to watch a man attack the woman you love (there is only one way a man should be allowed to put his hands on Grace Kelly) from your window and not being able to do anything about it. Or having a hulking man (the size of Raymond Burr) coming to kill you and not being able to flee or adequately defend yourself. It gives a level of creepiness that you won't find outside of Psycho or The Birds. Rear Window is one of Hitch's more chilling works.The DVD gives a better picture and sound quality over VHS and it is nice to be able to skip around the movie quickly. Unfortunately there is no commentary, but with Hitch dead and virtually no action who would be the logical choice? Probably better that no one attempts a commentary. In addition to trailers and production stills there are production notes, which give you that little bit of trivia that you can use to impress your friends with. There is also a featurette ""conversation with screenwriter John Michael Hayes"" which is interesting. And an hour long documentary titled ""Rear Window Ethics"" which is a commentary on the film (including audio interview excerpts with Hitchcock) and Restoring the Film. The two added featurettes are a definite plus for the DVD. Also, if you have a DVD-ROM on your computer you can get to a copy of the screenplay, which plays the section of the movie (in a little box in the corner) that you are reading.

The opening shot of the community is hard to believe that it's not NYC!, but a back-lot at the studios where the picture was filmed. But this is more than just a film its Hitchcock's autobigraphical celluloid version of his life! Hitchcock wasn't a pleasent man, he was very sardonic and on several occasions was very cruel to the people who worked with him even going as far as to chain a camera man over night to a camera and give him coffee laced with ex lax before hand! Even the films characters are based on people he hated for instance in the film Burr looks ever so much like Selznick the notorious producer who brought Hitchcock over from England and watched over him with a hawks eye. But as it stand the film is a perfect thriller the only downer is Stewart with his shirt off!! Kelly looks amazing as usal though she was never the best actress in hollywood she was one of the best movie stars. Stewart plays a photographer stuck in a wheelchair with a broken leg. After time he becomes obsessed with the ongoing lives of his neighbors peering in on them with a zoom lensed camera. When he believes he witnessed a murder across the yard he tells his elitest girlfriend grace Kelly about it who in turn gets wrapped up in the world of voyeristic pleasure. The plot tsists and turns so tightly around the stroy that sweat and confusion pours out of your pours! The climax is jus eye popping! Flashes of color admist a darken room as teh suspected killer finally caomes out of the shadows to bump Stewart off! Hitchcock never takes you inside of the houses he leaves always on the outside looking in on everything.

203511,A33NA8VLEORQRS,6300183513,"Alex ""Alex""","[0, 0]","Countless times during the 25 years I've been alive, I've heard someone older than me sigh nostalgically and comment, ""they just don't make 'em like they used to"" with regards to contemporary cinema.  And I have to agree in terms of objective fact, but not in spirit.  No, they don't make movies like they used to, and as far as I'm concerned, that's to the good- I much prefer movies made from 1965 on, for the most part.  However, there are certain films, such as Rear Window, that you recognize could never be made in this era where special effects, short attention spans, and cheap thrills, dominate the suspense/horror genre, and you have to sigh nostalgically, even if, like me, you weren't alive during the period of cinema for which you are yearning.  Fortunately, you can pop in the excellent DVD release of this classic Hitchock film anytime you like and be taken back to a time where, indeed, they still made movies like they used to.I don't see how you could not like this film.  As far as the acting goes, James Stewart is great as the crusty photographer with a broken leg and nothing to do but spy on his neighbors.  Meanwhile, the female lead, Grace Kelley, has the best role in the film, and she assumes it brilliantly.  Grace plays the woman of every man's dreams: heart-breakingly beautiful, kind, smart, and, as we find out in the film's climax, tough as nails.That said, the real star of this film is Hitchock, who once again advances the art of filmmaking with his unique sense of macabre and technical expertise.  The story here is mainly existential rather than suspenseful.  The act of violence around which the film is centered is the most chilling example of the darkness of modern/postmodern existence, but each apartment into which James Stewart looks provides both James and the viewer with some very dark insight into the pain, the banality, and the frustration and isolation, that has become ingrained into life as we know it.  Now, how many suspense films can you name that are philosophically profound in addition to dramatic?Finally, the DVD version is sweet.  I don't care much for extras, but the documentary is interesting.  Meanwhile, the sound and picture of the film itself won't give Terminator 2 a run for its money, but are both fantastic in DVD adaptation, especially given the period during which the film was made.In sum, see Rear Window many, many times.  That goes for those you who already have seen it many times, as well as for those of you have never watched it.  Maybe they'll never make another Rear Window, but hey, you couldn't pop the film into your DVD player and lounge on your sofa cuddled with your loved one, pet, or bottle of beer, back in 1954, now, could you?",5,A classic film in every sense of the word,1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,2725,"['Countless', 'times', '25', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'alive', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'someone', 'older', 'sigh', 'nostalgically', 'comment', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'used', 'regards', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'have', 'agree', 'terms', 'objective', 'fact', 'not', 'spirit', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'used', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'good-', 'much', 'prefer', 'movies', 'made', '1965', 'most', 'part', 'However', 'are', 'certain', 'films', 'such', 'Rear', 'Window', 'recognize', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'era', 'where', 'special', 'effects', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'dominate', 'suspense/horror', 'genre', 'have', 'sigh', 'nostalgically', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'alive', 'period', 'cinema', 'are', 'yearning', 'Fortunately', 'can', 'pop', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'release', 'classic', 'Hitchock', 'film', 'anytime', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'time', 'where', 'indeed', 'still', 'made', 'movies', 'used', 'to.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'James', 'Stewart', 'great', 'crusty', 'photographer', 'broken', 'leg', 'nothing', 'do', 'spy', 'neighbors', 'Meanwhile', 'female', 'lead', 'Grace', 'Kelley', 'best', 'role', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'Grace', 'woman', 'man', 'dreams', 'heart-breakingly', 'beautiful', 'kind', 'smart', 'find', 'out', 'film', 'climax', 'tough', 'said', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'Hitchock', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'art', 'filmmaking', 'unique', 'sense', 'macabre', 'technical', 'expertise', 'story', 'here', 'mainly', 'existential', 'rather', 'suspenseful', 'act', 'violence', 'film', 'centered', 'most', 'chilling', 'example', 'darkness', 'modern/postmodern', 'existence', 'apartment', 'James', 'Stewart', 'James', 'viewer', 'very', 'dark', 'insight', 'pain', 'banality', 'frustration', 'isolation', 'become', 'ingrained', 'life', 'know', 'Now', 'how', 'many', 'suspense', 'films', 'can', 'name', 'are', 'philosophically', 'profound', 'addition', 'dramatic', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'version', 'sweet', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'extras', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'Meanwhile', 'sound', 'picture', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'Terminator', '2', 'run', 'money', 'are', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'adaptation', 'especially', 'given', 'period', 'film', 'was', 'made.In', 'sum', 'see', 'Rear', 'Window', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'who', 'already', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'never', 'make', 'Rear', 'Window', 'hey', 'could', ""n't"", 'pop', 'film', 'DVD', 'player', 'lounge', 'sofa', 'cuddled', 'loved', 'one', 'pet', 'bottle', 'beer', 'back', '1954', 'now', 'could']",Rear Window VHS

James Stewart is marvellous as always, although I doubt if his part stretched him quite as much as other roles, in 'Vertigo' for example.The image on DVD is good, although this film (from 1954) goes not look as impressive as 'Vertigo' (1958) which is excellent.  Also don't miss Stewart's best screen performance in the fabulous courtroom drama 'Anatomy of a Murder' which looks superb on a black &amp; white MGM DVD.As for Hitch's 'North by Northwest' (1959), that is an absolutely stunning image on DVD, better than you could imagine.In this film, the image is warm and clear, although with a hint of grain on some fleshtones which occasionally do not look entirely natural.  Also there is some loss of sharpness, particularly on closeups.  The footage of the view from L B Jefferies' (Stewart's) window is very fine.  There are no serious nicks or scars that I noticed, just the occasional fleck.All in all this is the best 'Rear Window' has looked for home viewing, and too much should not be made of the slight flaws I have mentioned.

So says Stella (Thelma Ritter) at the start of ""Rear Window"". Alfred Hitchcock's best film and one of my all-time favorites. It's a key line into the film which was taken from a short story called ""It Had To Be Murder"" written by Cornell Woolrich and made into a screenplay by John Michael Hayes.""Rear Window"" gives Hitchcock the chance to explore one of his favorite themes;voyeurism. L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photographer for a magazine who managed to break his leg in an automobile race track accident. He has a cast from his foot up to his hip and has been in it for 6 weeks. Jeffries' passes his time by staring outside his window looking (or spying) at his neighbors. I've noticed many people seem to overlook something cruical in this. Jeffries as the saying goes is a ""watcher"" NOT a ""doer"". He is by profession a photographer. He's always seeing the world through his lens. Never actually experiencing life himself. I bet even if he wasn't injured it seems like the kind of thing this guy would do anyway. It's in his blood. It's how he makes his living. By capturing moments of people's lives or popular events. But, one day, Jeffries is going to see too much.What makes ""Rear Window"" such a great film is the way the screenplay is constructed. The viewer never knows more than the lead character. Everything we see, we only see becuase that's exactly what he sees. We can only draw the same conclusions he does, because we only know as much as him. If he says 1+1=3, we have to go along with him, because we don't know otherwise. And this is where all the suspense leads in. You see, for those who have never seen this movie. Jeffries thinks he has seen one of his neighbors murder his wife. Mr. Thorwald (Raymond Burr, who would later become a lawyer, go figure!) was seen leaving his house several times durning the night. We see him wrap up a saw and knife. And the next morning his bedridden wife is gone! Was she murdered? Or is there a reasonable explaination for everything? We are lead to believe she was murdered.Hitchcock has such a confident feel for the material. I don't know if his directing was ever better. Some may argue ""Psycho"" or ""Vertigo"" but, whichever film you chose you can't deny how brilliant his directing is here. The way he adds to the suspense. Our emotions go back and forth. Was there a murder committed or not?As with all Hitchcock films you can expect that dry wit. In my opinion it has never played off as well has it does here. It's all over the place. Take Thelma Ritter for example. She plays an insurance company nurse sent to take care of Jeffries. Her dialogue is full of witty remarks. Just about ever word she choses to use seems inappropriate at the time. There is also a character named ""Miss Lonelyheart"". A scene involves her getting dressed up, ligthing some candles, dimming the lights, fixing the dinner table and than pretending she has a gentleman guest. It may not sound funny as you read it, but, to see it will put a smile on your face.Besides Stella (Ritter) no one enters Jeffries apartment except Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly, looking her absolute best!). A designer who is a well known Manhattan socialite. Things are rocky in their relationship as Jeffries thinks she is ""too perfect"". But, naturally it's takes a murder to bring them together.""Rear Window"" was quite a big hit when first released. Hitchcock was at a peak in his career when this was made. The movie was nominated for 4 Oscars including ""Best Director"". When is was made it was also the largest set on the Paramount lot. But, that doesn't stop the movie from having a big city feel to it. Here's a Hitchcock movie any true Hitchcock fan HAS to see.Bottom-line: Alfred Hitchock's best film. One of my all-time favorites. Great directing, great acting and chemistry betwwen Stewart and Kelly.

203517,A2O7MOWVMSKO5J,6300183513,Andy Gill,"[2, 5]","Though it's unfashionable to say it, I'm not a big fan of Hitchcock. I watched Psycho, Frenzy, The Birds, Vertigo and Rope, and could not for the life of me work out why he was so popular, but then, after seeing it parodied in a `Simpsons' episode, I saw Rear Window. What, in the first five minutes, seemed a good 50's-era Hitchcock film became, within ten minutes, a good film, period. Rear Window is incredible in terms of acting, writing, filmmaking, everything. I've never liked James Stewart either, but in this film he is fantastic, and playing against Grace Kelly is a work of pure genius. Shot entirely within one room (except after Stewart has left the room, shall we say), it places the viewer in Stewart's position, trapped inside his two-room apartment, with nothing to do but gaze out of the window, and as such this creates an incredible level of empathy with the character. You feel his claustrophobia at the same time as feeling his compulsion to watch, and thus in terms of placing you within the film, Rear Window has no near rivals.The beauty of this film is in the simplicity of its construction. A guy, a girl, a room, and an apartment building opposite containing what looks like a wife-murderer. Perhaps because there are so few things to watch, you watch ten times harder than you watch other films. Anyone who has any voyeuristic tendencies (voyeur meaning the pleasure of looking, without the negative connotations of Peeping Toms) will love this film, and based on the success of shows like Big Brother and Survivor, there are a lot of people out there who take pleasure in looking. But not only is it great to watch, the characterisation is exceptional; Kelly and Stewart are great as the odd-couple Jeffries and Lisa, and serial-massager Stella is a wonderful counterpoint full of home-spun philosophies and unintentional witticisms. As the film progresses and the originally sceptical Lisa and Stella both become drawn into Jeffries' voyeurism, you are drawn too, so that when, towards the end, the line between watching and acting is crossed, you feel the increased sense of danger and excitement that they do. But it is not a tense film; it is hailed as a work of suspense, but it is difficult to see it as that. Rear Window is realistic, compelling folk drama, plain and simple and incredibly addictive.Admittedly, it's not everyone's cup of tea. I have friends who call it slow-paced and lacking in spectacle, but to me, every scene is imbued with some kind of hook that keeps you watching. Every character across the way has an evolving story, so even when the main story takes the back seat, you remain glued to the screen. As there can be unputdownable books, so this is an unlookawayable film. It is by far the best Hitchcock I have ever seen and is still better than 99% of films made today. To me, it is an asset to every film collection, regardless of whether you're into Hitchcock or not. You could definitely do worse than owning a copy of this.",5,Pleasure of the voyeur,983836800,"03 6, 2001",2001,2989,"['unfashionable', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Hitchcock', 'watched', 'Psycho', 'Frenzy', 'Birds', 'Vertigo', 'Rope', 'could', 'not', 'life', 'work', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'then', 'seeing', 'parodied', 'Simpsons', 'episode', 'saw', 'Rear', 'Window', 'What', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'good', ""50's-era"", 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'became', 'ten', 'minutes', 'good', 'film', 'period', 'Rear', 'Window', 'incredible', 'terms', 'acting', 'writing', 'filmmaking', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'James', 'Stewart', 'film', 'fantastic', 'playing', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'work', 'pure', 'genius', 'Shot', 'entirely', 'one', 'room', 'Stewart', 'left', 'room', 'shall', 'say', 'viewer', 'Stewart', 'position', 'trapped', 'two-room', 'apartment', 'nothing', 'do', 'gaze', 'window', 'such', 'incredible', 'level', 'empathy', 'character', 'feel', 'claustrophobia', 'same', 'time', 'feeling', 'compulsion', 'watch', 'thus', 'terms', 'placing', 'film', 'Rear', 'Window', 'rivals.The', 'beauty', 'film', 'simplicity', 'construction', 'guy', 'girl', 'room', 'apartment', 'building', 'opposite', 'containing', 'what', 'wife-murderer', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'things', 'watch', 'watch', 'ten', 'times', 'harder', 'watch', 'other', 'films', 'Anyone', 'who', 'voyeuristic', 'tendencies', 'voyeur', 'meaning', 'pleasure', 'looking', 'negative', 'connotations', 'Peeping', 'Toms', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'based', 'success', 'shows', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Survivor', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'pleasure', 'looking', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'watch', 'characterisation', 'exceptional', 'Kelly', 'Stewart', 'are', 'great', 'odd-couple', 'Jeffries', 'Lisa', 'serial-massager', 'Stella', 'wonderful', 'counterpoint', 'full', 'home-spun', 'philosophies', 'unintentional', 'witticisms', 'film', 'progresses', 'originally', 'sceptical', 'Lisa', 'Stella', 'become', 'drawn', 'Jeffries', 'voyeurism', 'are', 'drawn', 'too', 'when', 'end', 'line', 'watching', 'acting', 'crossed', 'feel', 'increased', 'sense', 'danger', 'excitement', 'do', 'not', 'tense', 'film', 'hailed', 'work', 'suspense', 'difficult', 'see', 'Rear', 'Window', 'realistic', 'compelling', 'folk', 'drama', 'plain', 'simple', 'incredibly', 'addictive.Admittedly', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'call', 'slow-paced', 'lacking', 'spectacle', 'scene', 'imbued', 'kind', 'hook', 'watching', 'Every', 'character', 'way', 'evolving', 'story', 'so', 'even', 'when', 'main', 'story', 'back', 'seat', 'remain', 'glued', 'screen', 'can', 'be', 'unputdownable', 'books', 'unlookawayable', 'film', 'far', 'best', 'Hitchcock', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'still', 'better', '99', '%', 'films', 'made', 'today', 'asset', 'film', 'collection', 'regardless', ""'re"", 'Hitchcock', 'not', 'could', 'definitely', 'do', 'worse', 'owning', 'copy']",Rear Window VHS

As the movie progresses, it becomes ever more puzzling to understand why would a woman, so incredibly intelligent, beautiful, elegant and with her own career, pursue a rude man nineteen years her senior, unkempt, with a somewhat dirty and greasy look, who treats her with sarcasm and condescension without any obvious reason.  Her behavior is even more unexplained when he tells her openly that if they parted, he would not miss her.  Yet she comes back!  And she does not impress as a submissive character, so why does she bother with him?I believe there is a power game between them, and her pride is hurt when he does not throw himself at her feet, perhaps he is the first man to resist her charms.  She doesn't know why but wants to discover, and she is determined to bring him to his knees, with him offering the wedding ring.  Once that happens, her game will be won and she would leave.  We can see how she takes an upper hand in the final scene, after her heroic break-in to the murderer's apartment, after that james' hero has no chance but to surrender, and immediately, as he is sleeping so obediently, like a baby, and in her care, she discards the book of their agreed-upon exotic voyages that she promised to him and turns instead to the most recent issue of Bazaar, her TRUE passion of fashion!!!  What a great battle of two egos, and poor James is totally defeated.His weakness and impotency is finally reveled in a scene when he sees her straggling with the murderer, and James does nothing except pathetically screaming, he is so passive at this moment, that we know his deep-hidden secret of incapacity, which is a source of his rudeness and cold reaction towards her.  We know that the power table is turning then, when she becomes a heroine and he is just a hopeless spectator and coward.  She is clearly the winner of the game.The film is a physiological masterpiece, and is worth watching alone for Grace's gowns.",5,View from the rear and hidden.,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,2059,"['most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'relationship', 'roles', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'movie', 'ever', 'more', 'puzzling', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'woman', 'so', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'beautiful', 'elegant', 'own', 'career', 'pursue', 'rude', 'man', 'nineteen', 'years', 'senior', 'unkempt', 'somewhat', 'dirty', 'greasy', 'look', 'who', 'sarcasm', 'condescension', 'obvious', 'reason', 'behavior', 'even', 'more', 'unexplained', 'when', 'openly', 'parted', 'would', 'not', 'miss', 'back', 'not', 'impress', 'submissive', 'character', 'so', 'why', 'bother', 'believe', 'power', 'game', 'pride', 'hurt', 'when', 'not', 'throw', 'feet', 'perhaps', 'first', 'man', 'resist', 'charms', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'discover', 'determined', 'bring', 'knees', 'offering', 'wedding', 'ring', 'game', 'will', 'be', 'won', 'would', 'leave', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'upper', 'hand', 'final', 'scene', 'heroic', 'break-in', 'murderer', 'apartment', 'james', 'hero', 'chance', 'surrender', 'immediately', 'sleeping', 'so', 'obediently', 'baby', 'care', 'book', 'agreed-upon', 'exotic', 'voyages', 'promised', 'instead', 'most', 'recent', 'issue', 'Bazaar', 'TRUE', 'passion', 'fashion', 'What', 'great', 'battle', 'two', 'egos', 'poor', 'James', 'totally', 'defeated.His', 'weakness', 'impotency', 'finally', 'reveled', 'scene', 'when', 'straggling', 'murderer', 'James', 'nothing', 'pathetically', 'screaming', 'so', 'passive', 'moment', 'know', 'deep-hidden', 'secret', 'incapacity', 'source', 'rudeness', 'cold', 'reaction', 'know', 'power', 'table', 'turning', 'then', 'when', 'heroine', 'just', 'hopeless', 'spectator', 'coward', 'clearly', 'winner', 'game.The', 'film', 'physiological', 'masterpiece', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone', 'Grace', 'gowns']",Rear Window VHS

It shows Hitchcock at his best in two different aspects of making movies. One is the technical aspect. The use of lighting, perspective, and the way that details and events are portrayed visually. The second is the aspect of storytelling. The way that the story unfolds, building tension and suspense at a deliberate pace as the plot transitions from humorous looks at newlyweds and a woman who lets her little dog out by lowering him to the ground in a basket, to the question of a possible murder. Hitchcock excells at both aspects of his craft, and he demonstrates his skill brilliantly in &quot;Rear Window&quot;.The story involves a professional photograher (played by Stewart) who is confined to a wheelchair for several weeks with a broken leg. Bored, he spends his time observing the lives of his neighbors whose apartments border the same courtyard as his. Hot summer weather guarantees lots of open windows. Things get serious when it begins to appear that the man across the courtyard has murdered his nagging wife. As other reviewers here have pointed out, this tale works on many different levels. But, whether you view it as a morality play about voyeurism or a psychological examination of commitment issues, the bottom line is that it is one of the best suspense movies you'll ever see.

But I'm on a bit of a Hitchcock thing right now and want to see all of his films.  One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment.  The obvious twists Mr. Hitchcock could have delivered upon us are never used. Perhaps we would have found out that in fact the neighbor's wife was alive, but that the neighbor was in fact involved in a crime. What was buried in the garden? The stolen jewel perhaps? No, We never really find out, they just elude to the mysterious treasure and we are left to assume it is just another cut up bit of wife.  Over all the story wasn't all that bad, it does pull you along, and it keeps you watching. But, admittedly a large part of that is because the viewer is left expecting one of those supposedly famous ""Hitchcock Twists"", but with a rushed and unimaginative ending, the twist never comes.

To  add a touch of sexual foreplay to the proceedings, Kelly models a variety  of '50s evening and nightwear, while teasing the injury-constrained Stewart  (&quot;Previews of Coming Attractions&quot;, she purrs).

Jimmy Stewart is in top form playing L.B. Jefferies, the photographer who enjoys to spy on his  neighbors in his free time. The beautiful Grace Kelly delivers a strong  female presence in the film, the scene where she first kisses Stewart is  incredibly sexy. While she is not remembered the most by her acting, but  then Hitchcock always said he used women as 'sex objects' and chose them  for their looks (the blonde goddess look seems to be his favorite), however  politically incorrect his methods were, it sure worked, and will keep on  working. Maybe Hitchcock's greatest accomplishment was making us feel like  a 'voyeur', and thinking that Stewart spying on his neighbors is a natural  thing, and we even want him to, more and more, as we get enthralled in the  mystery; did Mr. Thorwald kill his wife and is he really chopping up her  body?. We get hooked on that premise and that is when Hitchcock takes us  for a ride into his psychological roller-coaster, making us; the 'viewer',  feel like the 'voyeur', when we know that it is not right. The extremely  suspenseful ending is a knock-out and the whole film is an example of  Hollywood in it's golden years and of a genius at his peak.

Hitchcock includes everything in this very classy thriller with a involving romance between two compelling and enduring actors.  With humor, style, directing, script, visuals, and thrills, this one leaves you with such a satisfying feeling that it is impossible not to smile- and think about the thought-provoking visuals and themes.  Jimmy Stewart plays a man who is restricted to staying in his apartment due to being in a wheelchair.  With a socialite girlfriend(the charming Grace Kelly) and a &quot;wise&quot; physical therapist(a endearing Thelma Ritter), Stewart investigates the strange happenings going on in the apartment across from his.  As his interests grow, the trio goes through many hardships to satisfy their curiousness and prove their shocking theory.  The movie is absolutely well-paced, the structure and plot/character-development becoming more and more familiar and interesting.  Alfred Hitchcock wonderfully directs this film.  He had worked with the elegant Grace Kelly once before and had many meetings with her to talk about this film.  It was a pleasent surprise when he offered her the job of Lisa in REAR WINDOW.  Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense and the avant-garde.  Hitchcock was a very influential director, which he showed in this movie.  Almost all the shots originate from Stwewart's apartment.  Watch for him winding a clock in the musician/composer's apartment approximately half and hour into the movie.  The music is done by Franz Waxman, the great composer of SUNSET BLVD., THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, Hitchcock's own REBECCA, and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  Story by Cornell Woolrich, script by John Michael Hayes, and costumes by Hitchcock's staple designer, Edith Head.  This was one of Hitchcock's most ingenious thrillers.  This movie is also one of wit and subtleness.  Stella, my favorite character, has two of my favorite lines- &quot;We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change. Yes sir. How's that for a bit of homespun philosophy?&quot; and &quot;When two people love each other, they come together - WHAM - like two taxis on Broadway.&quot;  Buy this movie and experience a classic film that overachieves almost every aspect a good drama and comedy suspense should do- will satisfy everyone from the thrill lover to the analyzer(a great film to pick apart like many other Hitchcock films), and from the people who want fun to people who want meaning and depth.

203539,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6300183513,Bobby Underwood,"[2, 5]","This terrific classic focusing on our fear of intimacy and tendency toward voyeurism is one of Hitchcock's most entertaining films. There are no crop dusters or other devices to provide the tension this time and it works in the film's favor. Rear Window is a more character-driven film and the suspense builds slowly into a bonafide thriller. Hitchcock understood that most people are more comfortable looking at the lives of others from a distance and explores this area of our personalities in a very enjoyable fashion.Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a professional photographer wheelchair bound after an accident while on assignment. Grace Kelly is his  icily beautiful and doting girlfriend, Lisa. Jeff is feeling claustrophobic, not only about his immobility but about his relationship with Lisa, whose patience and elegant charm as she tends to his needs and waits for him to ask her to marry him are put to the test. The no-nonsense practicality of his nurse Stella, winningly portrayed by Thelma Ritter, makes a fine contrast to Kelly. Jeff, stationary and bored to tears, begins secretly watching his neighbors across the courtyard through the lens of his camera, becoming involved in their plight as if following a daily soap opera; taking to heart their loneliness and finding great pleasure in their finer moments. But something darker begins to take shape when Jeff pieces together witnessed events in one of the apartments across the courtyard and comes to believe he is spying on a killer.Both Lisa and Jeff's policeman pal Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey) think someone is letting their imagination run wild, at least in the beginning. Jeff's own disbelief and his girlfriend's early scorn begin to wane, morphing into an evermore dangerous pastime when Lisa becomes Jeff's legs. But the man who may have murdered his wife begins suspect that Jeff has seen too much, putting both their lives in danger. Hitchcock is marvelous here, using his own lens to show the voyeuristic inclination of us all, as Jeff's seemingly innocent means of passing the time from afar threatens to turn into a personal confrontation which he may not survive. Hitchcock deftly takes the viewer from a light and breezy beginning to a more concerned tone, until there is near panic, chiefly because we are all a bit voyeuristic, and can easily put ourselves in Jeff's situation.Like most of Hitchcock's films in Hollywood, it is a bit detached, but less so than others during this period, marking this as one of his finest.

She had seen only one Hitchcock movie before, The Birds, and it freaked her out so much she vowed to never again see one of his movies. I pleaded that Hitch only made one of those kinds of movies and this was certainly not one of them. She finally gave in but with much apprehension. We went to see the newly restored version at the Stanford, a terrific theater. She was quite attentive during the whole film and seemed to be taken in by the suspenseful elements. I digress, the movie we saw before this was Top Gun, her choice, which prompted me to take her to something of some substance. After leaving the movie, we walked down the avenue and I asked, ""Well, what did you think of that?"" and she thought for a second and replied ""I think that was best movie I ever seen.""You might want to consider this when looking for a good date movie.",5,Stewart and Kelly have a date,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,934,"['years', 'had', 'hell', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'go', 'see', 'Rear', 'Window', 'had', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'Birds', 'freaked', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'vowed', 'never', 'again', 'see', 'one', 'movies', 'pleaded', 'Hitch', 'only', 'made', 'one', 'kinds', 'movies', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'finally', 'gave', 'much', 'apprehension', 'went', 'see', 'newly', 'restored', 'version', 'Stanford', 'terrific', 'theater', 'was', 'quite', 'attentive', 'whole', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'taken', 'suspenseful', 'elements', 'digress', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'Top', 'Gun', 'choice', 'prompted', 'take', 'something', 'substance', 'leaving', 'movie', 'walked', 'down', 'avenue', 'asked', 'Well', 'what', 'did', 'think', 'thought', 'second', 'replied', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'seen', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'when', 'looking', 'good', 'date', 'movie']",Rear Window VHS

He spends most of his time gazing out the window at his neighbors, until one day he sees something that looks like a murder taking place. Grace Kelly plays his lover; she wants to marry him, but he thinks her pampered life makes her unsuitable for the rough life he leads. She, of course, leads the way in the dangerous murder probe they set out upon. It's to Hitchcock's credit that he had Kelly believe Stewart's story almost from the start, so we don't have to endure his trying to convince her it's true. (It also allows the picture to focus on its single point: she's no mamby-pamby and can do anything Stewart can.) The early going is rather slow - only the snappy dialogue saves it, though the suspense builds nicely near the end. Thelma Ritter is very good as Stewart's nurse - she has most of the wisecracking lines.

Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) laid low by an accident (the movie implies an incident at a racetrack) and confined to a wheel chair and a cast.  Jefferies has been so confined for some time and is only a week away from getting the cast cut off.  Bored, hot and chafing under his plaster fetters, Jefferies begins to spy on his neighbors.Jefferies' neighborhood is one that simply invites a voyeur.  He simply looks out the rear window across a quadrangle lot into the windows and lives of perfect strangers.  One is a lonely woman, another a frustrated songwriter, a retired couple and their dog, newlyweds, a sculptor, a dancer, and finally a traveling salesman who has a nagging, invalid of a wife.Our voyeur can only surmise the private going-ons of his subjects, but he studies them intensely.  The audience is also drawn to his watching, and with Jefferies, they draw the same conclusions.Jefferies focused observations of his neighbors is contrasted by his lack of introspection.  He is desperately courted by Lisa, played by none other than Grace Kelly but he is unable to commit to such a woman.  Instead he pushes her away.One evening something happens that make him suspect that there has been a murder-and the hitherto beached man of action rapidly starts to search for clues and bring others into his project of bringing the suspect, Lars Thorvald (Raymond Burr) to justice.  As the movie progresses the people Jefferies watches begin to have intensifying personal troubles that parallel Jefferies troubles in search for the truth.  In an ironic twist, Jefferies feelings for Lisa only surface when he sees her through the Rear Window.The movie is packed with a tremendous sense of danger, sexual tension, and gore of murder but these things are subtly hinted at and are carefully wrapped in a movie set of artistic beauty.  In different viewings this movie's thick detail can be enjoyed differently each time.

Grace Kelly is his fiance.  She comes over to help him with his recovery, although he is crankiness personified because of his condition. However, things look up when Stewart finds himself more and more engrossed by what is going on at his neighbor's apartment in another high rise, facing his.  The neighbor is played by Raymond Burr and Stewart starts to worry that Burr may be planning to do something awful to his wife.  This is a real nailbiter of a movie because Stewart is hugely limited on what he can do to help by being confined to his wheelchair. We are back in the 1950s so a phone is his only instrument of communication.  Also, Kelly is never there when the most suspicious things with Burr occur so Stewart's going to have trouble making the police believe him.  Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this is an extremely satisfying exploration of a man's bored voyeurism turning into a rollycoaster of a nightmare. Stewart and Kelly starred in several Hitchcock films. Stewart excels at playing the regular ok guy for whom life turns nightmarish in Hitchcock's films.  Kelly excels at playing the beautiful blonde society woman.  She is unaccustomed to crime interrupting her perfect life yet she can face crime with cool aplomb. For those who have only ever seen Burr in his heroic tv roles, they will be surprised to discover that he usually played dark or villainous roles in his earlier movie career.",5,Another Hitchcock Gem!,983232000,"02 27, 2001",2001,1539,"['Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'reporter', 'confined', 'high', 'rise', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'building', 'recovering', 'broken', 'leg', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'fiance', 'help', 'recovery', 'crankiness', 'personified', 'condition', 'However', 'things', 'look', 'up', 'when', 'Stewart', 'more', 'more', 'engrossed', 'what', 'going', 'neighbor', 'apartment', 'high', 'rise', 'facing', 'neighbor', 'played', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'Stewart', 'worry', 'Burr', 'may', 'be', 'planning', 'do', 'something', 'awful', 'wife', 'real', 'nailbiter', 'movie', 'Stewart', 'hugely', 'limited', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'help', 'being', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'are', 'back', '1950s', 'so', 'phone', 'only', 'instrument', 'communication', 'Also', 'Kelly', 'never', 'when', 'most', 'suspicious', 'things', 'Burr', 'occur', 'so', 'Stewart', 'going', 'have', 'trouble', 'making', 'police', 'believe', 'Directed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'exploration', 'man', 'bored', 'voyeurism', 'turning', 'rollycoaster', 'nightmare', 'Stewart', 'Kelly', 'starred', 'several', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'Stewart', 'playing', 'regular', 'ok', 'guy', 'whom', 'life', 'nightmarish', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'Kelly', 'playing', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'society', 'woman', 'unaccustomed', 'crime', 'interrupting', 'perfect', 'life', 'yet', 'can', 'face', 'crime', 'cool', 'aplomb', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'ever', 'seen', 'Burr', 'heroic', 'tv', 'roles', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'discover', 'usually', 'played', 'dark', 'villainous', 'roles', 'earlier', 'movie', 'career']",Rear Window VHS

The opening shot in that pans around Jeffries' apartment then out the window to see the rest of &quot;players&quot; in this little drama, before coming back to Jeffries and his wares is simply an amazing tour-de-force in filmmaking style and technique. One recalls other great reveals like the opening in PSYCHO (the overhead shot of the lover's at the end of their mid-afternoon tryst) or the final death-rattle at the beginning of ROPE, one can help but revel in the Master at work. But one of the top reveals in movie history is when Grace Kelly makes her entrance and kisses Jimmy Stewart... breath-taking (Harry Lime's reveal in the THIRD MAN is one of the few major rivals).And the opening is just the beginning, there are so many seminal Hitchcock moments in this film that one could continue discussing it for quite sometime, finding something new and exciting after each subsequent viewing - the true mark of magnificent cinema.Anyone who has seen this film before, but not the restored version, will be seeing a &quot;new&quot; film.

Doyle; a pre-Perry-Mason Raymond Burr; and Ross Bagdasarian, the voice behind Alvin and the Chipmunks(!)--it all comes together in a fascinating hybrid that has remained a landmark classic for almost 50 years.Like &quot;North By Northwest&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot;, all of which have preceded this movie on DVD, &quot;Rear Window&quot; appears to have some intriguing special features--a nice touch, especially considering the movie's age, and that none of the stars are with us any longer.

203555,A396SBGKAOLTZE,6300183513,Chris Aldridge,"[2, 2]","""Rear Window"" came to my attention 20 years ago, courtesy of my mom. She and I were talking about our favorite scary movies, and mine, of course, were confined primarily to blood and gore. She then told me about this amazingly simple story about ""a man confined to a chair who may or may not have seen a murder."" When I asked her how he could've seen a murder from his perspective in an apartment wheelchair, she told me ""that's where all the suspense comes from."" The movie was then rereleased in theaters, and I saw it for the first time. To put it simply, I was floored; no film with such a simple skeleton should have this much flesh and blood packed in a running time of 114 minutes. I went out and purchased it the moment it became a home video. The single-set confinement, the sub-stories involving the other neighbors, the cat-and-mouse interplay (not just with Jeffries and Thorwald, but with Stewart, Corey, Kelly, and Thelma Ritter) is spellbinding. (Sorry, that's another movie.) It's also a wonderfully adult movie, with more than a little sexy entendre betwixt James Stewart and the gorgeous Grace Kelly.

On this disc, the portion of her figure closest to the lower edge of the image is cropped away.

He is a professional photographer, so he likes to look at things.  In the course of staring out at the neighbors from his window, he believes he witnesses a murder.  He enlists the help of a detective friend, his visiting nurse, and his girlfriend.Like Lady Vanishes, the viewer is not really given any real clues if there was even a crime, or what happened.  So the viewer is not really given any privy information.  We follow along as a casual observer, given only the same amount of information as Jimmy Stewart has.It's an interesting film that is not only about a possible homicide, but it's about the neighbors and their seemingly ordinary lives.  Though we don't really see any interaction between the main characters and the neighbors, we get to know the neighbors, as Jimmy Stewart does, by viewing them through their windows.It's a wonderful and original film that is beautifully shot and well acted.  Jimmy Stewart is amazing as usual and Grace Kelly lives up to her name (Grace-fully).A great film, top notch!  The restoration is good, but I would have liked some more extra features.  Perhaps one day Criterion will get their hands on this film and do a really A+ restoration with oodles of extras.

203559,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,6300183513,C. Middleton,"[1, 2]","Rear window was taken from a short story entitled, ""It had to be Murder"" by Cornell Woolrich and adapted to the screen by John Michael Hayes  (The Man Who Knew Too Much) & (To Catch a Thief (Special Collector's Edition)). To Catch a Thief was Hayes's second collaboration with Hitchcock after Rear Window.What makes this particular thriller one of the all time greats in cinematic history is its simplicity, revealing human nature's tendency to voyeurism.L. B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is a photo journalist, forced to sit in his apartment because of a broken leg. He becomes extremely bored because his only contact to the outside world is his editor by phone, his nurse played with humour and charm, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and his stunning, rich girlfriend, Lisa Carole Fremont, (Grace Kelly) To alleviate his boredom, through the lens of his telescopic camera, he is able to spy on all his neighbours through his back window. It is through Jeffries eyes that the story is told as we get to know so many different characters with their interesting, mundane, sometimes lonely and murderous lives.Jefferies girlfriend, Lisa, visits him frequently, and in one scene brings in a catered dinner of lobster and fine champagne, looking absolutely ravishing to get Jefferies to stop obsessing with his telescope and his spying. Despite her beauty and the brilliant food, Jefferies has a suspicion: one of his neighbours has killed his wife, chopped up her body, and disposes the evidence in several trips with a suitcase. This fixation turns obsessive and suddenly manic as the evidence mounts against the ""husband"" (Raymond Burr).There are two story-telling devices that make a great thriller, mounting tension and the element of surprise. Rear Window has these qualities and much more.For me the best aspect of this film is the stories within the main story.

Someone wrote somewhere that Hitchcock more than most great directors needed strong, stylish actors to best show off his films. It's probably significant that some of his films that seem (to me) the weakest have leads that are uncharismatic, can't dominate the screen, or who simply don't mesh with Hitchcock's style. After Vertigo I think he ran out of male leads who had that style and who also were relatively young. My understanding is that Sean Connery and Paul Newman, both strong lead actors, did not enjoy working with Hitchcock...they simply didn't understand him and resented his directorial style, and it shows.I've never been too attracted to the high social ice queens that Hitchcock favored at this point in his career. Grace Kelly, however, I thought did a first-rate job of conveying her character's energy, her amusement at her own persona, of conveying a subtext of take-charge sexuality, and of being damn good looking.What I also find endearing is that the people in the apartments across the way were each given interesting stories that had beginnings, middles and endings...all with nearly no dialogue and all with the same distant camera angle.I've always had a soft spot for Wendell Corey, a fair actor in the Forties who seemed to get lost in the Hollywood shuffle games.

203563,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6300183513,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[5, 52]","Some films show their age, and others do not. Despite its reputation as a classic of great filmmaking, Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window, unfortunately, shows its age far too much. No, it's certainly not a bad film, by any standard, and is a pretty good one, but it's not one of Hitchcock's best, much less a great film, nor deserving of any place in the Top 100 Films lists of the last few years. Technically, it deserves many plaudits, but what really fails is the screenplay, written originally by John Michael Hayes for a radio play, and adapted from a short story by Cornell Woolrich. Yes, one can suspend disbelief from night till day comes, but the whole idea that a man would murder his wife and cut up her body all in front of an open window is sheerly implausible, even back in the 1950s New York milieu the film takes place in. Even one of the film's characters, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) comments on that fact, but it's not with irony, which only highlights the film's greatest failing- its implausibility.Now, there are genres where the suspension of disbelief is absolutely essential. For example, one of my favorite films from childhood, the original Planet Of The Apes (1968) requires a great suspension of disbelief, far more so than Rear Window does. After all, the Charlton Heston character, Colonel Taylor, a veteran trained astronaut and scientist, goes throughout the whole film not recognizing the sun and moon, the constellations, the unlikely evolutionary odds that humans and apes could evolve anywhere but Earth, and that the apes speak English, no less! It's not until he sees the wreck of the Statue Of Liberty that he realizes he's back on our world. I was four or five when I first saw the film, and knew it was Earth a minute or two after the astronauts arrived on the Planet Of The Apes. Perhaps too closely studying books on geology and science destroys a youthful ability to suspend disbelief, but the rest of the film was so brilliantly satirical that the implausibilities were minor solecisms. In short, there is no story unless we accept these liberties with common sense, including the fact that the astronauts could be frozen in suspended animation for two eons. It's an all or none proposition- accept, or walk out of the theater. Genres that depend on the implausible- like sci fi and horror, demand such of their audience, and once given it's foolish to quibble over things like time travel, faster than light speed, aliens, modern dinosaurs, ghosts, atomic age mutants, or the like....The plot is well known.... While not a great film overall, Rear Window is a technically great film. The camera work by cinematographer Robert Burks is first rate, and the film goes over many standard Hitchcock themes such as voyeurism- especially apt in this cyberworld of 24/7 voyeurism, marriage as a horror, and challenging technical restrictions, as in Lifeboat and Rope. There are many small moments in the film that work for effect- such as pure mise-en-scene shots of Jeff or the neighbors doing minor things unrelated to the main tale. And, there is some comedy, such as after Jeff is tossed out the window, and Thorwald is arrested, Stella comments to the cops, `I don't want any part of it', when asked about assisting in the search for Anna Thorwald's body. Still, none of the many pluses of the film are enough to lift the film up from a good, solid period piece, for Rear Window's reputation is based largely upon its claim to being a slice of `realism'. It's not. It's far closer to melodrama with its reliance on coincidences and implausibilities- not to mention the very sexism of the premise that a woman is so predictable that even her murder can be deduced by small deviances from that predictability, to propel the main action along. And melodrama, while it can often be great fun, is almost never great art. Rear Window is vastly overrated, and no exception that proves the rule. It is the rule, and that's a fact no amount of suspended disbelief can alter.",2,Overrated,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,4015,"['films', 'show', 'age', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'reputation', 'classic', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1954', 'film', 'Rear', 'Window', 'unfortunately', 'age', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'No', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'standard', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'much', 'less', 'great', 'film', 'deserving', 'place', 'Top', '100', 'Films', 'lists', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Technically', 'many', 'plaudits', 'what', 'really', 'screenplay', 'written', 'originally', 'John', 'Michael', 'Hayes', 'radio', 'play', 'adapted', 'short', 'story', 'Cornell', 'Woolrich', 'Yes', 'one', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'night', 'till', 'day', 'whole', 'idea', 'man', 'would', 'murder', 'wife', 'cut', 'up', 'body', 'front', 'open', 'window', 'sheerly', 'implausible', 'even', 'back', '1950s', 'New', 'York', 'milieu', 'film', 'place', 'Even', 'one', 'film', 'characters', 'Lisa', 'Fremont', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'comments', 'fact', 'not', 'irony', 'only', 'film', 'greatest', 'failing-', 'implausibility.Now', 'are', 'genres', 'where', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'example', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'childhood', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', '1968', 'great', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'far', 'more', 'so', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'character', 'Colonel', 'Taylor', 'veteran', 'trained', 'astronaut', 'scientist', 'whole', 'film', 'not', 'recognizing', 'sun', 'moon', 'constellations', 'unlikely', 'evolutionary', 'odds', 'humans', 'apes', 'could', 'evolve', 'anywhere', 'Earth', 'apes', 'speak', 'English', 'less', 'not', 'wreck', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'back', 'world', 'was', 'four', 'five', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'knew', 'was', 'Earth', 'minute', 'two', 'astronauts', 'arrived', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'closely', 'studying', 'books', 'geology', 'science', 'youthful', 'ability', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'satirical', 'implausibilities', 'were', 'minor', 'solecisms', 'short', 'story', 'accept', 'liberties', 'common', 'sense', 'including', 'fact', 'astronauts', 'could', 'be', 'frozen', 'suspended', 'animation', 'two', 'eons', 'none', 'proposition-', 'accept', 'walk', 'theater', 'depend', 'implausible-', 'sci', 'fi', 'horror', 'demand', 'such', 'audience', 'once', 'given', 'foolish', 'quibble', 'over', 'things', 'time', 'travel', 'faster', 'light', 'speed', 'aliens', 'modern', 'dinosaurs', 'ghosts', 'atomic', 'age', 'mutants', 'like', '.The', 'plot', 'well', 'known', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'overall', 'Rear', 'Window', 'technically', 'great', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'cinematographer', 'Robert', 'Burks', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'many', 'standard', 'Hitchcock', 'themes', 'such', 'voyeurism-', 'especially', 'apt', 'cyberworld', '24/7', 'voyeurism', 'marriage', 'horror', 'challenging', 'technical', 'restrictions', 'Lifeboat', 'Rope', 'are', 'many', 'small', 'moments', 'film', 'work', 'effect-', 'such', 'pure', 'mise-en-scene', 'shots', 'Jeff', 'neighbors', 'doing', 'minor', 'things', 'unrelated', 'main', 'tale', 'comedy', 'such', 'Jeff', 'tossed', 'out', 'window', 'Thorwald', 'arrested', 'Stella', 'comments', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'part', 'when', 'asked', 'assisting', 'search', 'Anna', 'Thorwald', 'body', 'Still', 'none', 'many', 'pluses', 'film', 'are', 'enough', 'lift', 'film', 'up', 'good', 'solid', 'period', 'piece', 'Rear', 'Window', 'reputation', 'based', 'largely', 'claim', 'being', 'slice', 'realism', 'not', 'far', 'closer', 'melodrama', 'reliance', 'coincidences', 'implausibilities-', 'not', 'mention', 'very', 'sexism', 'premise', 'woman', 'so', 'predictable', 'even', 'murder', 'can', 'be', 'deduced', 'small', 'deviances', 'predictability', 'propel', 'main', 'action', 'melodrama', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'great', 'fun', 'almost', 'never', 'great', 'art', 'Rear', 'Window', 'vastly', 'overrated', 'exception', 'rule', 'rule', 'fact', 'amount', 'suspended', 'disbelief', 'can', 'alter']",Rear Window VHS

203565,ANIHXYXKPZL2H,6300183513,"C. Roberts ""movie buff""","[1, 1]","&quot;Rear Window&quot; is rightly regarded as one of Hitchcock's best films and has been written about and analysed many times. Hitchcock considered it would be a challenge to make a film using just one set (he had done something similar in &quot;Rope&quot; also starring James Stewart in 1948). &quot;Rear Window&quot; is considered to be one of James Stewart's best roles even though he was confined to a wheelchair throughout the film. Grace Kelly was elegant as Stewart's girl friend and Raymond Burr made an impressive villain.Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photo journalist who is recovering from a broken leg and he passes the time by looking out of his window which overlooks several other apertments. He thinks that a murder has taken place in the apartment directly across from his. He has observed his neighbour Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) arguing with his wife and later becomes convinced that Thorwald has killed her and disposed of the body. He shares his thoughts with girl friend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) but she is reluctant to believe him and tells Jeffries that his imagination is getting the better of him. However, after observing Thorwald for some time she also becomes suspicious and agrees to help Jeff find evidence to support his theory. Jeffries is unable to leave his apartment due to being in a wheelchair with his broken leg so Lisa volunteers to break into Thorwald's apartment to look for clues when he is out. Naturally, Thorwald returns and catches her in there which places Lisa in great danger with Stewart helpless to do anything while watching from across the courtyard.Some favourite lines from the film:James Stewart (to Grace Kelly): &quot;I've seen it through that window - I've seen bickering and family quarrels and mysterious trips at night. Knives and saws and ropes, and now since last night not a sign of the wife&quot;.Kelly (to Stewart): &quot;Start from the beginning again Jeff. Tell me everything you saw - and what you think it means&quot;.Wendell Corey (to Stewart): &quot;You didn't see the killing or the body - how do you know there was a murder?&quot;.Raymond Burr (to Stewart): &quot;What do you want from me?.One of the delights in watching a Hitchcock film is to be clever enough to spot the director's cameo appearance. (In &quot;Rear Window&quot; he was winding a clock in the music composers apartment about an hour into the film). In his early films he sometimes did not appear until near the end (as in &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; for example). However, as people became aware of this gimmick Hitchcock realised it would spoil the audiences concentration of the film if they were watching for him to pop up so he began to make his cameos earlier in the films to get them out of the way. James Stewart appeared in four films for Hitchcock - the others were &quot;Rope&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;. Grace Kelly made two other films for Hitchcock - &quot;Dial M For Murder&quot; and &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;.

203566,A2TL9FBMOC7AVK,6300183513,Curtis Crawford,"[1, 1]","Not only does this marvelous film cater to one's desire for a peek at the neighbors, but it makes their daily round unrealistically interesting, attractive or affecting.  The courtyard of the Manhattan apartment I once inhabited had no lovely ballerina starting the day with graceful, sensual dance, or talented songwriter filling the night air with live, semi-classical piano.  Rather, my window opened on the blare and schlock of commercial television and radio.Jimmy Stewart's neighbors include not only a killer who considerately leaves his shades up for everything but the crime but also Miss Lonelyheart, who searches and grieves in full view, another woman who eloquently laments and protests (to all the world who failed to stop it) the murder of her pet dog, and policemen who arrive within seconds after being summoned to stop a fight.  Who would need movies if ordinary life were this alive?Although Stewart is prone, with left leg in full cast, his role is something like that of a male ballet dancer, functioning as a kind of center off and around whom others play.  These ""others"" include not only his neighbors (for the most part unaware of him), but also his visitors.  In dialogue, we first see this with Thelma Ritter, who plays his skillful, no-nonsense nurse.  Stewart's unassuming, brief responses set off her fast, funny, caring, shrewd paragraphs.  For how many people do insurance companies provide nurses like this?But of course the crowning wish-fulfillment is Grace Kelly as Stewart's would-be bride.  If there is another movie in which she is this beautiful, lead me to it.  The beauty is in her carriage, her looks, her clothes, her speech, her love, her intelligence, her pluck, her resourcefulness, her resilience, her good temper, her liveliness.  (That she stays superbly attractive is the more remarkable, since aggressive pursuit is not ordinarily a becoming posture.)  Here she is, mine to enjoy.  The more so, because Stewart's retreats leave her more available to me, who would be glad to fill in.The murderer is played by Raymond Burr, who spent much of his cinematic life as a central character, Perry Mason.  Here, he mostly elicits action from others, rather than providing it himself, which is perhaps the fate of most criminals in detective stories they precipitate.  There is of course the last, frightening struggle between him and Stewart, a climax more crucial for the plot than for my enjoyment of the movie, which had already been signed, sealed and delivered.By the way, two recent customer reviews see Stewart as totally or partly defenseless as Burr approaches his apartment.

I have been a long standing fan of Hitchcock, not because I shiver at the sight of his films but because as a storyteller he is one of the most brilliant men who ever directed a film.  The problem with `Rear Window' to me is that you spend almost two hours just waiting for something to happen, and the suspense your promised doesn't really rear it's head.The film follows L.B. Jeffries (Stewart), a photographer who is still recovering from an accident where his leg was broken.  He's stuck in his home until his cast is removed and he has nothing to do with his time but spy on his neighbors.  In the process of doing so he thinks he uncovers a murder take place (or at least he thinks he uncovers a murder, for he never really sees the murder happen).  He tries of course to convince those around him, including his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly) and his nurse (Ritter), and he succeeds on those accounts, but when it comes to getting his friend Lt. Thomas Doyle (Corey) he fails to do so.Because of that Jeffries and his two accomplices decide to take matters into their own hands by sneaking into Lars Thorwald's (Burr) apartment (he's the man they assumed killed his wife) and by digging up the garden where they assumed he buried her.  I guess to me that main problem is that for the majority of this film nothing is happening.  We, the viewer, are just watching what Jeffries watches, which is pretty much nothing.  The story is a fine story it's just a bit boring.

That's what's been written on the plaster cast on the aforementioned Jeffries, an ace photographer who's been in a wheelchair for seven weeks because he got too close during a race car match.Jeffries is bored and listless, but at least his days in limbo gives him a view of life's passing parade through his binoculars, namely the other tenants whom he can see through his window.  The show's starring attraction is Miss Torso, a blonde buxom ballet dancer who can be seen shaking her thing and wearing nice pink bikinis-Jeffries expression on seeing her is priceless.  (Yes, she is nice, isn't she?) The songwriter who's lost his muse, a pair of newlyweds, a couple with a dog who fight the hot summer heat by sleeping on their balcony, and Miss Lonelyheart, a single woman who undergoes the being single blues.  However, during a particularly sleepless night, he notices how Mr. Thorvald, a jewelry salesman with an invalid wife, goes in and out of his apartment three times during the late hours, returning once with a large saw.  Why hasn't he been in his wife's bedroom all day?  ""Something's terribly wrong,"" he surmises.Jeffries is also going through a bit of a crisis with his girlfriend Lisa Freemont, and they are quite a pair.  He's more a rough action-type of guy, having served in the war, going on tough assignments on one suitcase, entering tough situations, while she's ""too perfect,"" having that chic, ultrasophisticated, rarified Park Avenue ambience, never wearing the same dress twice.  Jeffries is thinking that he wants someone too ordinary, someone who can bear up to his way of life if she wants to come along.  He's the old-fashioned type who thinks that ""nothing has caused the world more trouble than intelligence,"" and goes on to discuss how psychoanalysis and interpretation of different emotional levels as examples.It takes the goings-on of the Thorwald apartment to draw the strained couple together, as Lisa uses her feminine intuition to realize that indeed a woman wouldn't leave such an expensive handbag, jewelry, and her wedding ring behind if she was going to leave on a long trip.  However, feminine intuition and Jeffries' speculations don't convince his war buddy and now detective Tom Doyle, who does some digging around to humor Jeffries and finds out the wife isn't dead.  And the final half hour, after a dramatic incident, when Lisa, Jeffries, and the latter's insurance-provided nurse Stella all join in and decide to brashly throw caution to the wind, that the excitement rises to a fever pitch.Rear Window's also one of the many New York films, showing the apartment life of the tenants as seen through Jeffries, played superbly by James Stewart in his second Hitchcock film, the other being Rope (1948), the next one to be the tepid remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), and later, another classic, Vertigo (1958).Like Stewart, this was Grace Kelly's second of three Hitchcock films, the other two being Dial M For Murder and To Catch A Thief.  As Lisa Fremont, she gives one of her cold ice princess roles.  She looks elegant in her pink nightgown, and dresses well, but she provides a shot of audacity herself in the final half hour.And Thelma Ritter does another great turn as Stella, giving her usual wisecracking schtick as a supplement to James Stewart's flippancy.  She tells of her talent as a foreteller of bad things, saying of the Wall Street crash, ""When GM has to go the bathroom ten times a day, the whole country has to let go.""  The other two players worth mentioning is Judith Evelyn as Miss Lonely Heart and as guilty pleasure/eye candy, Georgine Darcy as Miss Torso.  And it's Raymond Burr (Perry Mason, Ironside) as Mr. Thorvald himself.One of Hitchcock's all-time classics, and one of my favourite personal four, the others being Spellbound, Vertigo and The Birds.",5,On Rear Window ethics in a classic Hitch film.,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,3889,"['Here', 'broken', 'bones', 'L.B', 'Jeffries', 'what', 'been', 'written', 'plaster', 'cast', 'aforementioned', 'Jeffries', 'ace', 'photographer', 'who', 'been', 'wheelchair', 'seven', 'weeks', 'got', 'too', 'close', 'race', 'car', 'match.Jeffries', 'bored', 'listless', 'least', 'days', 'limbo', 'view', 'life', 'passing', 'parade', 'binoculars', 'namely', 'other', 'tenants', 'whom', 'can', 'see', 'window', 'show', 'starring', 'attraction', 'Miss', 'Torso', 'blonde', 'buxom', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'shaking', 'thing', 'wearing', 'nice', 'pink', 'bikinis-Jeffries', 'expression', 'seeing', 'priceless', 'Yes', 'nice', ""n't"", 'songwriter', 'who', 'lost', 'muse', 'pair', 'newlyweds', 'couple', 'dog', 'who', 'fight', 'hot', 'summer', 'heat', 'sleeping', 'balcony', 'Miss', 'Lonelyheart', 'single', 'woman', 'who', 'being', 'single', 'blues', 'However', 'particularly', 'sleepless', 'night', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Thorvald', 'jewelry', 'salesman', 'invalid', 'wife', 'apartment', 'three', 'times', 'late', 'hours', 'returning', 'once', 'large', 'saw', 'Why', ""n't"", 'been', 'wife', 'bedroom', 'day', 'Something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'also', 'going', 'bit', 'crisis', 'girlfriend', 'Lisa', 'Freemont', 'are', 'quite', 'pair', 'more', 'rough', 'action-type', 'guy', 'having', 'served', 'war', 'going', 'tough', 'assignments', 'one', 'suitcase', 'entering', 'tough', 'situations', 'too', 'perfect', 'having', 'chic', 'ultrasophisticated', 'rarified', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'ambience', 'never', 'wearing', 'same', 'dress', 'twice', 'Jeffries', 'thinking', 'someone', 'too', 'ordinary', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'bear', 'up', 'way', 'life', 'come', 'along', 'old-fashioned', 'type', 'who', 'nothing', 'caused', 'world', 'more', 'trouble', 'intelligence', 'discuss', 'how', 'psychoanalysis', 'interpretation', 'different', 'emotional', 'levels', 'examples.It', 'goings-on', 'Thorwald', 'apartment', 'draw', 'strained', 'couple', 'together', 'Lisa', 'feminine', 'intuition', 'realize', 'indeed', 'woman', 'would', ""n't"", 'leave', 'such', 'expensive', 'handbag', 'jewelry', 'wedding', 'ring', 'was', 'going', 'leave', 'long', 'trip', 'However', 'feminine', 'intuition', 'Jeffries', 'speculations', 'do', ""n't"", 'convince', 'war', 'buddy', 'now', 'detective', 'Tom', 'Doyle', 'who', 'digging', 'humor', 'Jeffries', 'out', 'wife', ""n't"", 'dead', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'dramatic', 'incident', 'when', 'Lisa', 'Jeffries', 'latter', 'insurance-provided', 'nurse', 'Stella', 'join', 'decide', 'brashly', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'excitement', 'fever', 'Window', 'also', 'one', 'many', 'New', 'York', 'films', 'showing', 'apartment', 'life', 'tenants', 'seen', 'Jeffries', 'played', 'superbly', 'James', 'Stewart', 'second', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'other', 'being', 'Rope', '1948', 'next', 'one', 'be', 'tepid', 'remake', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', '1956', 'later', 'classic', 'Vertigo', '1958', 'Stewart', 'was', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'second', 'three', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'other', 'two', 'being', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'Catch', 'Thief', 'Lisa', 'Fremont', 'one', 'cold', 'ice', 'princess', 'roles', 'elegant', 'pink', 'nightgown', 'well', 'shot', 'audacity', 'final', 'half', 'hour.And', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'great', 'turn', 'Stella', 'giving', 'usual', 'wisecracking', 'schtick', 'supplement', 'James', 'Stewart', 'flippancy', 'talent', 'foreteller', 'bad', 'things', 'saying', 'Wall', 'Street', 'crash', 'When', 'GM', 'go', 'bathroom', 'times', 'day', 'whole', 'country', 'let', 'go', 'other', 'two', 'players', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Judith', 'Evelyn', 'Miss', 'Lonely', 'Heart', 'guilty', 'pleasure/eye', 'candy', 'Georgine', 'Darcy', 'Miss', 'Torso', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Ironside', 'Mr.', 'Thorvald', 'himself.One', 'Hitchcock', 'all-time', 'classics', 'one', 'favourite', 'personal', 'four', 'others', 'being', 'Spellbound', 'Vertigo', 'Birds']",Rear Window VHS

There is a lot to occupy your mind in this film aside from the pure suspense of the plot.  You can ponder Jeffries's inability to commit to Lisa (could the cast on his leg be a symbol of impotence?).  Jeffries's profession is essentially voyeuristic--has he forgotten that he can be an active participant in events?  Aside from his reluctance to engage with Lisa, there is at least one crucial moment in the film when he remains inactive even though there are avenues of action open to him.

203576,A36L1F0YECOAW8,6300183513,David Grant,"[0, 1]","Like all of Hitchcock's films, 'Rear Window' examines the duality of nature. To be more particular, the thrill and guilt of voyeurism. Sidelined by an accident and confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg, photographer James Stewart sits in his sweltering apartment with nothing more to do then look out his window. The simple hobby soon becomes an obsession when he grows to believe that one of his neighbors, a costume jewelry salesman played by Raymond Burr, has killed his wife. Hitchcock's amazing ability to craft suspense sequences figures in what can only be described as a nailbiting finale. This is very much a movie about moviegoing. Each of the occupants in the apartments Stewart watches has it's own story: Ms. Torso, the beautiful ballet dancer seen entertaining numerous men, Ms. Lonely Heart, who dresses up and waits for someone to come to her door, and a struggling songwriter who, right before our very eyes and ears, composes a song that ultimately becomes the very theme of the movie. We see Stewart watching these people, followed by his reaction. Thus is the essense of moviegoing. When his girlfriend (a radiant Grace Kelly) makes her way to Burr's apartment in search of evidence, Burr suddenly comes back. Stewart watches the volitile situation from his chair, unable to intervene, just watch. It's simply brilliant, made at a time when Hitchcock's powers were at their peak. Any person who enjoys film both as art and entertainment needs to see this film. The DVD edition is beautiful, the sound incredible. This is a film where the soundtrack is of utmost importance since the only sounds we hear are the sound from outside Stewart's window (whenever there is music playing on the film's soundtrack, it is coming from a neighbor's apartment, etc.).

203577,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,6300183513,David M. Lovin,"[2, 2]","Hitchcock directed his movies so that the audience would see and feel exactly what the characters in the movie experienced.  Never was this done more obviously or more effectively than in Rear Window, the 1954 classic with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly.Stewart is a magazine photographer who has suffered a broken leg.  He is forced to spend most of his day in a wheelchair, and his only entertainment is staring out the window of his Greenwich Village apartment.  Kelly is in love with him and wants to marry him.  He wants no part of that (for some reason) and is contemplating ending the relationship.It is interesting that we learn a lot about six or seven of his neighbors just by watching with Stewart.  There's the songwriter, who goes from failure to success right before our eyes, and the newlywed couple, who move in at the beginning full of love and lust and end up at the end like a couple married for 20 years.  Miss Torso is his name for a shapely young woman with multiple suitors and he calls another Miss Lonelyhearts, who is desperate for companionship.The most interesting neighbor is Raymond Burr.  He has an invalid wife who disappears suddenly.  Stewart sees suspicious things in the middle of the night and develops a theory that Burr has killed his wife and disposed of her.  At first no one believes him, but eventually they come along and spy with him, trying to figure out what happened.  Stewart has a detective friend who refuses to be convinced, but Stewart tries over and over to explain why he thinks the wife is dead.Throughout the film, Hitchcock has us totally hooked.  We are right there with Stewart and we are totally enamored by Kelly, who may have one of the most sensual screen openings in film history.  Thelma Ritter is Stewart's housemaid, and she dispenses advice on relationships and how to handle this supposed murder.In the end, we learn whether Stewart's suspicions have any merit.  I can say that there is lots of tension and suspense along the way.  It takes real guts to make a film like this, where you are limited to one section of a room for almost two hours.  Hitchcock's genius is clearly obvious here.

203585,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6300183513,Dennis Littrell,"[0, 2]","This is the quintessential Hitchcock flick, easy to understand, addictively interesting, featuring great stars (Grace Kelly and James Stewart), familiar bit players (Thelma Ritter in one of her best roles as Stewart's talkative nurse), and a kind of almost imperceptible satire on the human animal.  In this case, Hitchcock has glorious fun displaying a whole range of human behaviors through the device of watching them through a Greenwich Village rear window before the age of air conditioners when everyone had to leave their windows open (and some even slept on the fire escape-I've done that) to cope with the appalling heat and humidity during an eastern seaboard heatwave.James Stewart stars as L.B. Jeffries, an adventurerous photographer who has a broken leg and is confined to his apartment in a cast while it heals.  Bored beyond belief, he becomes a voyeur of his neighbors.  Meanwhile there is his girlfriend, none other than Grace Kelly playing a &quot;too perfect&quot; socialite intent on winning his heart and soul.  Trouble is Jeff worries that it won't work out, that they are essentially incompatible, she a socialite, who always goes first class, he a roughing it man of the world comfortable with second class accomodations.  Naturally the audience (me!) finds it incredible that he isn't madly in love with her.Raymond Burr (long TV's Perry Mason) in gray hair and specks has an interesting role as Lars Thorwald, seen almost entirely from a distance across the courtyard doing very suspicious things with knives and suitcases and mysterious comings and goings in the middle of the night.  Bored voyeurs wonder what is going on.  There is some light romantic play between Stewart and Kelly, but it is decidedly secondary to the voyeuristic adventures seen through the rear window: the saga of Miss Lonelyhearts, the ardor of the newlyweds, the angst of the songwriter, the exhibitionism of the dancing beauty, the pampered dog in a basket, and Thorwald and his invalid and then missing wife.  Hitchcock's America at midcentury.  Each of the little stories within the story has a plot and a resolution: Miss Lonelyhearts finds her man.  The songwriter finds somebody who appreciates his work.  Dancing beauty's man (looking from a distance a little like Woody Allen in an army uniform) returns.  The groom seeks a break from his exhaustive marital duties, etc.  Hitchcock's sense of satire has the softest touch, which is why, I think, he is so beloved.  In the final scene Grace Kelly, finding her man asleep, puts down the adventure book she is reading (for his benefit) and picks up Harper's Bazaar to check the fashions.  One gets the sense of future marital bliss and especially, marital reality.There is some tension and some mystery, but nothing too strenuous for little old ladies from Pasadena, and nothing to offend anybody and nothing too graphic.  You can see this with the kids and your maiden aunt and all will find it interesting.  See it for Thelma Ritter, the sadonic character actress of many films, most notably this and All About Eve (1950).",4,Midcentury voyeurism,1029456000,"08 16, 2002",2002,3083,"['quintessential', 'Hitchcock', 'flick', 'easy', 'understand', 'addictively', 'interesting', 'featuring', 'great', 'stars', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'James', 'Stewart', 'familiar', 'bit', 'players', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'Stewart', 'talkative', 'nurse', 'kind', 'almost', 'imperceptible', 'satire', 'human', 'animal', 'case', 'Hitchcock', 'glorious', 'fun', 'displaying', 'whole', 'range', 'human', 'behaviors', 'device', 'watching', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'rear', 'window', 'age', 'air', 'conditioners', 'when', 'everyone', 'had', 'leave', 'windows', 'open', 'even', 'slept', 'fire', 'escape-I', ""'ve"", 'done', 'cope', 'appalling', 'heat', 'humidity', 'eastern', 'seaboard', 'heatwave.James', 'Stewart', 'L.B', 'Jeffries', 'adventurerous', 'photographer', 'who', 'broken', 'leg', 'confined', 'apartment', 'cast', 'Bored', 'belief', 'voyeur', 'neighbors', 'Meanwhile', 'girlfriend', 'none', 'other', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'playing', 'quot', 'too', 'perfect', 'quot', 'socialite', 'intent', 'winning', 'heart', 'soul', 'Trouble', 'Jeff', 'worries', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'are', 'essentially', 'incompatible', 'socialite', 'who', 'always', 'first', 'class', 'roughing', 'man', 'world', 'comfortable', 'second', 'class', 'accomodations', 'Naturally', 'audience', 'incredible', ""n't"", 'madly', 'love', 'her.Raymond', 'Burr', 'long', 'TV', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'gray', 'hair', 'specks', 'interesting', 'role', 'Lars', 'Thorwald', 'seen', 'almost', 'entirely', 'distance', 'courtyard', 'doing', 'very', 'suspicious', 'things', 'knives', 'suitcases', 'mysterious', 'comings', 'goings', 'middle', 'night', 'Bored', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'light', 'romantic', 'play', 'Stewart', 'Kelly', 'decidedly', 'secondary', 'voyeuristic', 'adventures', 'seen', 'rear', 'window', 'saga', 'Miss', 'Lonelyhearts', 'ardor', 'newlyweds', 'angst', 'songwriter', 'exhibitionism', 'dancing', 'beauty', 'pampered', 'dog', 'basket', 'Thorwald', 'invalid', 'then', 'missing', 'wife', 'Hitchcock', 'America', 'midcentury', 'little', 'stories', 'story', 'plot', 'resolution', 'Miss', 'Lonelyhearts', 'man', 'songwriter', 'somebody', 'who', 'work', 'Dancing', 'beauty', 'man', 'looking', 'distance', 'little', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'army', 'uniform', 'returns', 'groom', 'break', 'exhaustive', 'marital', 'duties', 'etc', 'Hitchcock', 'sense', 'satire', 'softest', 'touch', 'why', 'think', 'so', 'beloved', 'final', 'scene', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'finding', 'man', 'asleep', 'down', 'adventure', 'book', 'reading', 'benefit', 'up', 'Harper', 'Bazaar', 'check', 'fashions', 'One', 'sense', 'future', 'marital', 'bliss', 'especially', 'marital', 'reality.There', 'tension', 'mystery', 'nothing', 'too', 'strenuous', 'little', 'old', 'ladies', 'Pasadena', 'nothing', 'offend', 'anybody', 'nothing', 'too', 'graphic', 'can', 'see', 'kids', 'maiden', 'aunt', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'See', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'sadonic', 'character', 'actress', 'many', 'films', 'most', 'notably', 'Eve', '1950']",Rear Window VHS

The film is a witty and strong testament about voyeurism without venturing into dark territory. In the case of Rear Window it concerns a physically disabled photographer's desperation to peak out the window of his apartment into the lives of his neighbors.  His new hobby while unhealthy, is an amusing, sympathetic portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock's reoccurring theme of how voyeurism plays a role for the viewer in cinema.Everything works perfect, the cast, the story, the direction, even the cinematography. James Stewart as the protagonist L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies and Grace Kelly as his love interest Lisa Fremont have excellent chemistry together in the film along with a strong supporting cast.  The story is a clever, fresh, and funny execution of how the male gaze (as the camera lens) can function as a source of voyeur pleasure.  As the audience we are captivated in Jeff's life as he gazes through his camera to solve a murder mystery that happens across his apartment window.  Grace Kelly remains a heartfelt beauty, the woman in his life who's only desire is to divert Jeff's gaze away from the activity outside his apartment to herself.  Lisa represents Jeff's real world in which he is distracted away from by all that does not concern him.  Jeff's disability becomes a mental one as well as physical.The movie is a film that should be watched while you are laying down with your feet propped up at night when you have the chance.  In essence you as the viewer become Jeff, sitting back and relaxing as Hitchcock invites you into another world.  I love all of Hitchcock films. Rear Window is among his best achievements.

Thelma Ritter, Grace Kelly, and the courtyard are shown while dialogue from Thelma Ritter's argument with Stewart about Lisa, and Lisa's argument with Stewart, are heard with an echo. The composer's new song is heard.The second takes place after Stewart has waked up and noticed the salesman taking a suitcase out during the rain, coming back, and taking the suitcase out again. The composer's song is heard over the image which shows the salesman arguing with his wife, the artist neighbor telling the salesman he is giving the plants too much water, Thelma Ritter saying ""I've got a nose for trouble, I can smell it ten miles away."" Then Ritter says, ""I can smell trouble right in this apartment. First you break your leg, then you start looking out the window, seeing things you shouldn't see,"" while we see the wife catching the salesman in the other room talking to his girlfriend on the phone, then Ritter saying ""We've become a race of Peeping Toms, what we ought to do is get outside ourselves and look in once in a while. The New York sentence for a Peeping Tom is six months in the workhouse. There are no windows in the workhouse. You know, in the old days they used to put people's eyes out with a red-hot poker. Any of those worth a red-hot poker?"" as we see the salesman carrying the suitcase out into the rain.When Stewart wakes up the apartment complex is dark, the shades are drawn. He sees Miss Torso come home from her evening out. Then he sits up as he sees the salesman coming back for a second time with the suitcase.Each sequence is introduced by a rippling of the image of Stewart's sleeping face, and his face is superimposed over the dream images.These dream sequences articulate the major themes of the movie: the dubious morality of voyeurism, Stewart's sexual ambivalence about Grace Kelly and his interest in other women, the salesman's conflict with his wife, Thelma Ritter's attempts to persuade Stewart to come back to a normal way of living. The salesman's problems with his wife are an analog to Stewart's problems with Grace Kelly. The core of voyeurism is sexuality, and this is shown over and over again in the movie. The motive for the salesman's murder of his wife is another woman. Miss Lonelyhearts' attempted suicide is because of her failed relationships with men. Miss Torso is fighting off suitors and trying to save herself for her husband, who, in a comic moment at the end of the movie, returns from military service more interested in food than in his sensual wife. The newlyweds keep their shades drawn because they are making love.The restorers should have researched the film more carefully.

203597,A1IPFS2WVJ1XP8,6300183513,Dorian Tenore-Bartilucci,"[2, 2]","Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock's trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it's one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can't imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD's documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter.  Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy (""Miss Torso""), then one of the last surviving cast members.

But soon the pair become convinced that he might be onto something - no doubt looking for a little excitement themselves. The local detective that Jefferies phones, Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), who is a friend of his, takes a great deal more convincing that something is amiss.The excitement in the movie arises from the attempts of the trio (Jefferies, Lisa and Stella) to get more convincing evidence, and Thorwald's response to the confrointation.

203600,A382SS3RQVTZF0,6300183513,Dr Ren Codoni,"[0, 0]","194us Rear window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1954, 112')Written by John Michael Hayes (with whom there is a delightful interview in the features of the dvd, and who won a 1955 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture), based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story ""It Had to Be Murder"". Originally released by Paramount Pictures, the film stars James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr. It was screened at the 1954 Venice Film Festival. The film is considered by many filmgoers, critics and scholars to be one of Hitchcock's best.After breaking his leg during a dangerous assignment, professional photographer L B ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Stewart) is confined in his Greenwich Village apartment, using a wheelchair while he recuperates. His rear window looks out onto a small courtyard and several other apartments. During a summer heat wave, he passes the time by watching his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool. They include a dancer (""Miss Torso"", played by Georgine Darcy), a lonely woman (""Miss Lonelyheart""), a songwriter, several married couples, a middle-aged sculptor, and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a wholesale jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.Jeff discusses his observations with his wealthy socialite girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Kelly) and his insurance company home-care nurse Stella (Ritter), and becomes obsessed with their theory that Thorwald murdered his wife. He explains their theory to his friend Tom Doyle (Corey), a New York City Police detective, who looks into the situation but finds nothing suspicious. A few days later, the heat has lifted. The lonely neighbor woman chats with the songwriter in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.In the last scene of the film, Lisa reclines beside Jeff, appearing to read a book on foreign travel in order to please him, but as soon as he is asleep, she puts the book down and happily opens a fashion magazine. The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and is considered one of Hitchcock's finest films.Time called it ""just possibly the second most entertaining picture (after The 39 Steps) ever made by Alfred Hitchcock"" and a film in which there is ""never an instant ... when Director Hitchcock is not in minute and masterly control of his material."" The same review did note ""occasional studied lapses of taste and, more important, the eerie sense a Hitchcock audience has of reacting in a manner so carefully foreseen as to seem practically foreordained.""Franois Truffaut in the Cahiers du cin&eacute;ma in 1954 centers on the relationship between Jeff and the other side of the apartment block, seeing it as a symbolic relationship between spectator and screen. Film theorist Mary Ann Doane has made the argument that Jeff, representing the audience, becomes obsessed with the screen, where a collection of storylines are played out. This line of analysis has often followed a feminist approach to interpreting the film.In his book, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", John Belton addresses the underlying issues of voyeurism, scopophilia, patriarchy and feminism that are evident in the film. He quotes ""Rear Window's story is ""about"" spectacle; it explores the fascination with looking and the attraction of that which is being looked at."" Generally, Belton's book asserts that there is more to Hitchcock's thriller than what initially meets the eye. These issues that society faces today are all more than just present in the film, they are emphasized and strengthened.Hitchcock uses sound to convey the thematic elements behind Jeff's behavior and the audience's relationship to his subjective point of view. The music in Rear Window is entirely diegetic, and therefore every character in the courtyard hears the sound and acts based on what they hear. Hitchcock is less interested in reality than in how reality is perceived. Thus his use of entirely diegetic sound illustrates the idea that what we see as the audience is real.194us - Rear window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1954, 112') -Rare view - 10/10/2012",5,Rare view,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,4139,"['194us', 'Rear', 'window', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1954', '112', 'Written', 'John', 'Michael', 'Hayes', 'whom', 'delightful', 'interview', 'features', 'dvd', 'who', 'won', '1955', 'Edgar', 'Award', 'Best', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'based', 'Cornell', 'Woolrich', '1942', 'short', 'story', 'Had', 'Be', 'Murder', 'Originally', 'released', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'film', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'was', 'screened', '1954', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'film', 'considered', 'many', 'filmgoers', 'critics', 'scholars', 'be', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best.After', 'breaking', 'leg', 'dangerous', 'assignment', 'professional', 'photographer', 'L', 'B', 'Jeff', 'Jeffries', 'Stewart', 'confined', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'apartment', 'using', 'wheelchair', 'rear', 'window', 'out', 'small', 'courtyard', 'several', 'other', 'apartments', 'summer', 'heat', 'wave', 'time', 'watching', 'neighbors', 'who', 'keep', 'windows', 'open', 'stay', 'cool', 'include', 'dancer', 'Miss', 'Torso', 'played', 'Georgine', 'Darcy', 'lonely', 'woman', 'Miss', 'Lonelyheart', 'songwriter', 'several', 'married', 'couples', 'middle-aged', 'sculptor', 'Lars', 'Thorwald', 'Burr', 'wholesale', 'jewelry', 'salesman', 'bedridden', 'wife.Jeff', 'observations', 'wealthy', 'socialite', 'girlfriend', 'Lisa', 'Fremont', 'Kelly', 'insurance', 'company', 'home-care', 'nurse', 'Stella', 'Ritter', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'theory', 'Thorwald', 'murdered', 'wife', 'theory', 'friend', 'Tom', 'Doyle', 'Corey', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Police', 'detective', 'who', 'situation', 'nothing', 'suspicious', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'heat', 'lifted', 'lonely', 'neighbor', 'woman', 'songwriter', 'apartment', 'dancer', 'lover', 'home', 'army', 'couple', 'dog', 'was', 'killed', 'have', 'new', 'dog', 'newly', 'married', 'couple', 'are', 'bickering.In', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'Lisa', 'beside', 'Jeff', 'appearing', 'read', 'book', 'foreign', 'travel', 'order', 'please', 'as', 'soon', 'asleep', 'book', 'down', 'happily', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'film', 'received', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'critics', 'considered', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'finest', 'films.Time', 'called', 'just', 'possibly', 'second', 'most', 'entertaining', 'picture', '39', 'Steps', 'ever', 'made', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'never', 'instant', 'when', 'Director', 'Hitchcock', 'not', 'minute', 'masterly', 'control', 'material', 'same', 'review', 'did', 'note', 'occasional', 'studied', 'lapses', 'taste', 'more', 'important', 'eerie', 'sense', 'Hitchcock', 'audience', 'reacting', 'manner', 'so', 'carefully', 'foreseen', 'seem', 'practically', 'foreordained', 'Franois', 'Truffaut', 'Cahiers', 'du', 'cin', 'eacute', 'ma', '1954', 'centers', 'relationship', 'Jeff', 'other', 'side', 'apartment', 'block', 'seeing', 'symbolic', 'relationship', 'spectator', 'screen', 'Film', 'theorist', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Doane', 'made', 'argument', 'Jeff', 'representing', 'audience', 'obsessed', 'screen', 'where', 'collection', 'storylines', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'line', 'analysis', 'often', 'followed', 'feminist', 'approach', 'interpreting', 'film.In', 'book', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'John', 'Belton', 'underlying', 'issues', 'voyeurism', 'scopophilia', 'patriarchy', 'feminism', 'are', 'evident', 'film', 'Rear', 'Window', 'story', 'spectacle', 'fascination', 'looking', 'attraction', 'being', 'looked', 'Generally', 'Belton', 'book', 'more', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller', 'what', 'initially', 'eye', 'issues', 'society', 'today', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'present', 'film', 'are', 'emphasized', 'strengthened.Hitchcock', 'uses', 'sound', 'convey', 'thematic', 'elements', 'Jeff', 'behavior', 'audience', 'relationship', 'subjective', 'point', 'view', 'music', 'Rear', 'Window', 'entirely', 'diegetic', 'therefore', 'character', 'courtyard', 'sound', 'acts', 'based', 'what', 'hear', 'Hitchcock', 'less', 'interested', 'reality', 'how', 'reality', 'perceived', 'Thus', 'use', 'entirely', 'diegetic', 'sound', 'idea', 'what', 'see', 'audience', 'real.194us', 'Rear', 'window', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1954', '112', '-Rare', 'view', '10/10/2012']",Rear Window VHS

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Alfred Hitchcock was in near-perfect form when he made ""Rear Window,"" a stylish, minimalistic blend of mystery and dark comedy. This thriller explores ""what you shouldn't see"" skilfully, with a few funny bits thrown in. And having a cast that includes Grace Kelly and James Stewart doesn't hurt either.Photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Stewart) got run over during a shoot, and is crankily waiting for his cast to come off. While he does so, he spies on his neighbors -- some sleep on balconies, some argue, some weep alone, and some (""Miss Torso"") dance in spandex. To make things worse, Jeff is having intimacy problems with his wealthy girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), because he fears settling down.But then Jeff's window-watching clues him in to something -- sickly Mrs. Thorwald vanishes, and her husband Lars (Raymond Burr) is seen acting suspiciously with a saw, rope and metal case. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. He manages to convince Lisa and his down-to-earth nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), but detectives won't believe him. So without moving from the room, Jeff uses the rear window to watch Thorwald -- and find out what really happened.Okay, peeping on your neighbors is not just creepy, it's illegal. In the case of ""Rear Window,"" that fact doesn't really matter. Watching the fellow tenants is as much fun as the mystery itself, whether it's the newlyweds, the pair that sleep on the balcony, the weepy Ms. Lonelyheart, or the buxom dancer Miss Torso. It makes the story even more chilling when you realize that one -- or maybe more than one -- of these seemingly harmless people is a murderer.Hitchcock -- who appears as a musician -- kept his deft touch in a movie that could have sunk like a stone. All the action takes place in one room, but he keeps it from feeling confining. Instead, the minimalistic set takes away all distractions, and makes the interplay between the characters even brighter. And much of the humor is provided by Ritter -- she's not a comic character, but her homespun wisdom is delivered with tart humor.Jeff is likable as only James Stewart could make him -- this guy is bored, crabby and in denial about his feelings for Lisa, but he's likable despite that. Kelly does an equally solid job as the ""girl who is too good for him,"" who also proves that in a pinch she can rise beyond her uptown-girl roots. Back when many women were relegated to side roles, Lisa gets to be an equal detective to Stewart.""Rear Window"" gives a view into one of Hitchcock's best films, a taut thriller about how, if you watch other people, you might see something dangerous.

An entire Greenwich Village apartment complex and courtyard was built inside a Paramount studio building to create Hitchcock's unforgiving microcosm of lonely souls that stretches the ethical envelope of voyeurism. James Stewart plays L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, an adventure photographer, wheelchair-bound with a week left in his cast for a broken leg. He is itching for some excitement and not even the devoted attention of an impossibly beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa, a Park Avenue fashion model is enough for him. Stuck in his apartment all day, he sees the comings and goings of his neighbors, all strangers to him, and pieces together their lives and gives them pseudonyms like ""Miss Torso"" and ""Miss Lonelyhearts"".  But his attention focuses on a suspicious, white-haired man named Thorwald. Jeff becomes increasingly intrigued by his neighbor's odd behavior and the sudden disappearance of his nagging, bedridden wife. Jeff suspects a murder plot, which seems far-fetched at first, but becomes gradually more evident as his obsession infects Lisa, his masseuse Stella and his detective buddy Tom.Hitchcock was indeed the master of suspense, but the movie is suffused with an unexpectedly light sense of humor that touches rather candidly on sex and relationships thanks to John Michael Hayes' sharp script.  Lisa's entanglement with Thorwald is played out well, especially as Jeff looks on helplessly from his apartment. Stewart is wonderfully sly throughout, giving hints of the inner torment he displays later in ""Vertigo"" but still likeable even as he tries to reject his glamorous, sheltered girlfriend. Kelly seems merely decorative at first, but she sharpens as her character gains a fearless sense of intrigue that Jeff finds alluring. Thelma Ritter plays a smarter and warmer variation of her typical wisecracker as Stella, while Wendell Corey is his usual nondescript stalwart self as Tom. Raymond Burr, pre-Perry Mason, shows up as Thorwald and lends interesting ambiguity to his menacing character.  Robert Burks' probing camerawork makes the perfect complement to Hitchcock's trademark filmmaking style, and special mention needs to be given to Robert A. Harris's splendid 1998 work in restoring the film's original splendor, even the slow-motion first kiss between Stewart and Kelly. The DVD has a couple of nice extras, an hour-long documentary that focuses on the ethics behind the story and the restoration effort, and a brief interview with screenwriter Hayes.

203606,A35J4XGRWXVZ00,6300183513,Edward,"[7, 8]","A daredevil confined to a wheelchair is the concept of Alfred Hitchcock's comedy-mystery &quot;Rear Window&quot;, a man of action so bored with his confinement that he begins spying on the neighbors he can see across his Greenwich Village courtyard: the frustrated composer,the &quot;interpretative dancer&quot;, the newlyweds, the desperately lonely spinster ... and the bickering couple. The wife suddenly disappears. Has she been murdered? L.B. Jeffries thinks so, and he convinces his fianc&eacute;e Lisa (Grace Kelly) and the insurance company nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) who visits him every day. (Jeffries, a professional photographer, has been temporarily disabled in an accident.) This set-up is perfect for Hitchcock, who loved tense situations in close quarters (&quot;Life Boat&quot;, &quot;Rope&quot;), and who was in top form when he directed this masterpiece of entertainment in 1954. (There was a made-for-TV remake a few years back; according to... reviewers, it's pretty awful.) James Stewart was one of Hollywood's most popular personalities, but he was often mis-cast. He was pushing fifty when he played the 25-year old Lindbergh in&quot;The Spirit of St Louis&quot;. Similarly, in &quot;Rear Window&quot; he's too mature for the lead. The part just weeps for William Holden. Stewart even takes his shirt off in a couple of scenes, revealing a pale, thin physique. The idea that Grace Kelly would travel all the way down from the East Sixties to Greenwich Village to spend the evening with him is a little ... well,unbelievable. Miss Kelly is almost as seductive here as she was in her next Hitchcock &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;.The Master was obviously infatuated -- but, then, who wasn't? She also had a droll sense of humor: the way she pronounces &quot;weird&quot; is priceless. Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey give witty support. Raymond Burr, just a couple of years away from playing the most famous of fictional lawyers, is quite creepy as the killer Thorwald. The sound track is a mixed marvel of car traffic, distant voices, and snatches of music; it sounds great with stereophonic ear phones.

Additionally, Rear Window offers some interesting insights into human nature and shows that, like L.B. Jeffries, we (as movie watchers) are essentially voyeurs.Basically, Rear Window is about photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) who, not being able to move due to a cast on his broken leg, starts to use his powerful camera lenses to observe people in the neighboring apartments. While watching, he notes the strange behavior of one man...and then begins to believe that the man murdered his wife. With a beautiful girlfriend (Grace Kelly) at his side, Jeffries investigates the situation, creating a great deal of suspense. The movie has a wonderfully clever conclusion which I am NOT going to describe: watch it and find it out for yourself!Anyhow, this is a true thriller, Hitchcock style. It features classic actors (James Stewart, especially, is amazing in this film), a creative, original plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and interesting thoughts about voyeurism, etc. As a last point, Rear Window has a real sense of atmosphere - it really transports the viewer to the apartment building in the hot summer.

203610,A1JY32VVKRTGQZ,6300183513,"Emily ""Em's Joie de Weird""","[4, 7]","If you watch Hitchcock's Rear Window, you may be deceived into thinking that not much thought went into it.  It's so seamless, you can't see how clever it is.  There are two sets, and they blend into each other.  The whole shebang - Jeff's apartment, the courtyard, and the other apartments the main characters can see into - was filmed on a big soundstage.  The sounds and music in the movie are ambient, what you would naturally hear if you lived in one of those apartments.  This enhances the reality of the setting, and puts the characters and story in the forefront.  We're really there with Jeff, a world-traveling photographer who's laid up with a broken leg and going stir crazy.  That's why we're able to see, almost from the beginning, that things are not what they seem.The screenplay is based on Cornell Woolrich's short story, ""It Had To Be Murder.""  Woolrich was one of the best American short story writers of the 20th Century, a master of suspense.  John Michael Hayes' adaptation is perfect, and I suspect it was shaped as much by the cast as it was by the necessities of the movie medium.  Grace Kelly owns the role of Lisa - I think it's her best role ever.  She's so believable, you know she lives beyond the story, having adventures well into her 90s.Jimmy Stewart made several great movies with Alfred Hitchcock, including Vertigo, an almost-perfect movie.  Vertigo is marred by an info-dump scene in which Kim Novak's character writes a letter explaining a plot point.  The studio insisted this was necessary, because the executives who saw the first screening were too dumb to figure out what was going on.  If Hitchcock could have lived long enough to see the ""Director's Cut"" videos that have since become the norm, I'm sure he would have insisted on releasing a version without that dopey letter scene in it.Fortunately, Rear Window made it to the final cut without that sort of tampering.  Complementing Kelly and Stewart is a cast of veteran character actors.  Thelma Ritter shines as the visiting nurse, Wendell Corey makes you believe he's a police detective who also fought in WWII.  The actors who play the neighbors whose antics are so fascinating really seem to be living the lives of those people.  And Raymond Burr is one of the scariest movie killers I've ever seen.Though Burr is a big guy, he's not an ax-wielding, snarling, macho kind of killer.  He's clever, quiet, and sneaky.  You don't get a hint of the violence he's capable of until someone actually confronts him.  Even then, you get the feeling he'd rather not mix it up with anyone, he just wants to get rid of the multiple packages that used to be his wife and get on with his new life.Stewart's character is also not a macho guy, though he has a lot of courage.  He's never afraid to say what he thinks, but even if he didn't have a broken leg, you get the feeling Burr could have kicked his butt.  That's what makes the final confrontation between the two so suspenseful.One terrifying moment that stands out in Aliens is the scene where the door to the freight elevator opens.  You suspect the Queen alien is crouched in that shadowy space, but you don't know for sure until you see the light glistening on those dreadful teeth.  In Rear Window, the cinematographer manages to achieve that effect with Raymond Burr's glasses as he steps into Jeff's darkened apartment.  Somehow, this nerd gear is transformed into something really creepy and threatening.  Burr manages to make the salesman sound both pathetic and dangerous when he demands to know who Jeff is and what he wants.Rear Window doesn't have a formal score, unless you count the title sequence (""Juke Box #6""), a delightful crime-jazz piece written by Franz Waxman in the heyday of the great movie scores.  Otherwise, music plays on the radio, or is sung by drunken partygoers, or is tinkered together on a piano by a struggling songwriter in his rooftop studio.

There is nothing I could add to what has been said before in praise.However, I question why the film was letterboxed when the original movie was shot with a ratio of 1.33:1 (or 4:3).  Paramount Pictures, in 1954, had not released anything in Vista Vision, their wide screen answer to Cinemascope. &quot;White Christmas&quot; would be the first to be released later that year in the new process.After comparing the new DVD to my 1984 VHS tape, I noticed some striking discrepancies.  The most obvious were the shots when James Stewart looked through his camera viewfinder.  What he, and we, saw was a complete circle, with the image contained within the circle.  On the DVD, this circle is cropped at the top and bottom.  Why?Also, during the DVD documentary on how the film was restored, a technician is seen holding the actual film.  It plainly shows the movie was shot in the common ratio of 1.33:1.  When before and after comparisons are shown, one can clearly see extra image at the top and bottom of the before shot.  Again, why letterbox?For such a great film, my criticisms may seem of low importance.  I would just rather not see cropping like this happen to other restorations of great classics in the future.",5,Great Film.

This film was MADE for Blu-ray, because every face, action, flower and brick on the set looks real and tangible. The water-color paintings in Raymond Burr's apartment aren't just there; they seem to pop out and scream, ""Look at me!""  No fooling. I was amazed at the cornucopia of detail I had missed by watching the normal DVD version. This just goes to prove that a movie studio CAN bring their film to Blu-ray with a ""true"" restoration, and keep it intact for those who love it. Disney Pictures could take a lesson here--but they probably won't. While they continue tampering with perfection, painting mustaches on the Mona Lisa, I will instead be collecting the Hitchcock films on Blu-ray, delighting in the untampered mastery which produced them.This disc has some wonderful bonus material--the only problem is, the menu for it doesn't appear until I finish watching the movie all the way to the end.

203617,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6300183513,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 1]","Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism.  When we watch a film, aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?Hitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While ""Rear Window"" as a whole is probably not quite at a level with ""Vertigo"" (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions.  Hitchcock's mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa's nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle's reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says ""Be Careful, Tom"".  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.Hitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn't see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the ""Ice Maiden"" in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between ""Psycho"" (#18) and ""Vertigo"" (#61).  I personally think more highly of ""Vertigo"" but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10/10.

L.B. Jefferies (Stewart) is a professional photographer who is incapacitated in his flat with a broken leg. All he has to pass the time is watching the people across the courtyard. Although he very rarely interacts with them, he slowly begins to know them just by spectating. Pretty soon he realizes something is amiss when the annoying wife across the way is no where to be seen and her husband (Burr) is acting strangely. With help of his ravishingly beautiful girlfriend (Kelly), Jeffries tries to uncover the truth. Everything escalates when Lisa breaks into the man's apartment and it finally peaks in a climatic confrontation. In the end all is well and Jeffries realizes his true love. This is one of my favorite films because of its unique setting and it is possibly Hitchcock's best.

203622,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,6300183513,Frederick Baptist,"[9, 15]","This movie is a great one to encapsulate what makes Hitchcock films great.  His brand of storytelling is unique and for me very enjoyable.  He always shows us the story from the subjective viewpoint of the actor and in this case, Jimmy Stewart, as the temporarily invalid photographer who out of boredom decides to take an interest in his neighbour's activities.  In effect, he is watching many television screens aka windows outside his apartment that happen to be screening real-life soap operas.I disagree that what he does amounts to voyeurism because he doesn't really watch continuously just to get gratuitous pleasure out of it but he really appears to be concerned about his neighbour's well-being.  He tries to prevent the lonely one from committing suicide in addition to the main part of the story about his concern for the invalid woman who was killed by her husband.  I thought the beautiful irony was that while everyone was critical of Stewart's character spying or peeping at his neighbours and yet his concern for them and his willingness to even put his life on the line to help them contrasts with that of the other neighbours who just didn't give a damn and who are supposed to be doing the right thing.  The scene with the dead dog perfectly illustrates this as at one apartment, the party simply resumes as if nothing happened after the distraught owner's emotional outburst.  I just loved the dramatic irony of how Stewart's character was really the good neighbour despite his peeping while the others were really bad neighbours minding their own business just like in the parable of the Good Samaritan.The screenplay was very well written and the witty and comical dialogue especially between Stewart's character and the masseuse was very amusing indeed.  The acting wasn't brilliant but was good enough and I enjoyed the theme about the differences between man and woman and how their motivations are driven by different things and yet both are really trying to arrive at the same thing: happiness in a life together.  The final scene with Grace Kelly and the magazine was especially telling and amusing for me.The special features are quite good and I especially like the documentary ""Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic.""  The only problem is with the dvd which sound quality wise isn't great and the picture quality despite being restored is quite poor with many imperfections on too many frames.  This suggests to me that the original master must be very poorly preserved if this is the best that they could do.  Here's hoping that with the advent of Blu-ray they will take the opportunity to have another try at improving both the picture and sound quality.  For the latter a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround restored sound option would be much appreciated.Not one of Hitchcock's absolute best but still a very good film; recommended but you may want to wait for a better restored version to be made available and to give this dvd version a miss.",3,Fun and Entertaining Except For the DVD!,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,3000,"['movie', 'great', 'one', 'encapsulate', 'what', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'great', 'brand', 'storytelling', 'unique', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'always', 'story', 'subjective', 'viewpoint', 'actor', 'case', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'temporarily', 'invalid', 'photographer', 'who', 'boredom', 'decides', 'take', 'interest', 'neighbour', 'activities', 'effect', 'watching', 'many', 'television', 'screens', 'aka', 'windows', 'apartment', 'be', 'screening', 'real-life', 'soap', 'operas.I', 'disagree', 'what', 'amounts', 'voyeurism', ""n't"", 'really', 'watch', 'continuously', 'just', 'get', 'gratuitous', 'pleasure', 'really', 'be', 'concerned', 'neighbour', 'well-being', 'prevent', 'lonely', 'one', 'committing', 'suicide', 'addition', 'main', 'part', 'story', 'concern', 'invalid', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'husband', 'thought', 'beautiful', 'irony', 'was', 'everyone', 'was', 'critical', 'Stewart', 'character', 'spying', 'peeping', 'neighbours', 'yet', 'concern', 'willingness', 'even', 'put', 'life', 'line', 'help', 'contrasts', 'other', 'neighbours', 'who', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'scene', 'dead', 'dog', 'perfectly', 'one', 'apartment', 'party', 'simply', 'nothing', 'happened', 'distraught', 'owner', 'emotional', 'outburst', 'just', 'loved', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'how', 'Stewart', 'character', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'neighbour', 'peeping', 'others', 'were', 'really', 'bad', 'neighbours', 'minding', 'own', 'business', 'just', 'parable', 'Good', 'Samaritan.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'witty', 'comical', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'Stewart', 'character', 'masseuse', 'was', 'very', 'amusing', 'indeed', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'brilliant', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'enjoyed', 'theme', 'differences', 'man', 'woman', 'how', 'motivations', 'are', 'driven', 'different', 'things', 'yet', 'are', 'really', 'trying', 'arrive', 'same', 'thing', 'happiness', 'life', 'together', 'final', 'scene', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'magazine', 'was', 'especially', 'telling', 'amusing', 'me.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'documentary', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Ethics', 'Remembering', 'Restoring', 'Hitchcock', 'Classic', 'only', 'problem', 'dvd', 'sound', 'quality', 'wise', ""n't"", 'great', 'picture', 'quality', 'being', 'restored', 'quite', 'poor', 'many', 'imperfections', 'too', 'many', 'frames', 'original', 'master', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'poorly', 'preserved', 'best', 'could', 'do', 'Here', 'hoping', 'advent', 'Blu-ray', 'will', 'take', 'opportunity', 'have', 'try', 'improving', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'latter', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'restored', 'sound', 'option', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'absolute', 'best', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'recommended', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'better', 'restored', 'version', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'give', 'dvd', 'version', 'miss']",Rear Window VHS

Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 2]","Released in 1954, REAR WINDOW was a major success with critics and public alike--and unlike some Hitchcock films, which were praised at the time but negatively re-evaluated, it has held up incredibly well over time.Loosely suggested by several notorious crimes, the premise of REAR WINDOW is widely famous.  Photographer L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to his New York apartment with a broken leg, alternately nursed and harrassed by his elegant girl friend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and pragmatic day nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter.)  Annoyed and bored, he begins to watch his neighbors across the courtyard--and soon notices the activites of Mr. and Mrs. Thorwald (Raymond Burr and Irene Winston.)  Their quarrels quite suddenly cease, Mrs. Thorwald is no longer visible, and Mr. Thorwald is unexpectedly given to taking packages out of the house.  Is it murder?The set for REAR WINDOW has long garnered a great deal of attention, and deservedly so: it is a meticulous sound stage re-creation of New York apartment buildings of the era, and with few exceptions both the camera work and sound effects are presented from Jefferies' point of view: we see what he sees and hear what he hears.  In the process, we become as much of a peeping tom as Jefferies himself, a device that tends to make audiences increasingly squirm as the film progresses.  At the same time, however, we are also privy to Jefferies' private life, most particularly his rocky relationship with Lisa, who wants marriage but whom Jefferies rejects as incompatible with his own lifestyle.The performances here are extraordinary, with James Stewart cast against type as Jefferies and Grace Kelly sparkling as the high-fashion Lisa.  But the real stunner is the supporting cast, which ranges from the truly remarkable Thelma Ritter to the host of players who are glimpsed from Jefferies' window as they go about their daily routines: the lonely lady, the musician, the newly married couple, the scultor, the woman with the dog--and, of course, ""Miss Torso,"" a particularly voluptuous blonde who spends her time in what Lisa calls ""a woman's hardest job: juggling wolves!""This is Hitchcock working at the peak of his talents, working his themes of isolation, vulnerability, and most particularly voyerism to the nth degree.  The script is tight, the cinematography is flawless, and the production designs are beyond perfection.  Critics may argue which film can be regarded as Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece, but even the most picky among them will place REAR WINDOW either at or very near the top slot--and so will you.  Truly memorable and beautifully restored on this DVD release.

The casting of James Stewart as the indecisively contained L.B. Jeffries sets a standard for quality immediately. Through Jefferies, the viewer is taken on a ride featuring the neighborhoods finest and not so finest. His recent confinement has consumed him with others affairs and it takes the ultimate step to personal involvement. His romantic interest is the beautiful Grace Kelly who plays Lisa. She is as empowered a woman can be given the time period and is insistent on joining Jefferies in marriage. Her devotion to him is tested as he carries on in his obsession. She is at first resistant to his new hobby, but finds the voyeurism as a means to get closer to L.B.The movie's first half is effective in developing major and minor characters.

He thus is in a wheelchair and lives life by inspecting and observing everyone in the neighborhood. He has his binoculars and learns that one person might be an opera singer, and another might be a writer. That's what he does the whole day. What's so fantastic about this is a study of people and their hobbies and jobs. The photographer has nothing to do and can find out dark secrets of some neighbors even. When he is convinced that the wife of one neighbor has dissapeared, he inspects the husband, convinced he has killed her and burried her in her garden. He then sends his girlfriend over to the man's apartement to inspect. His plan is dangerous but absolutely brilliant.

Don' t ever consider  our starring is a vulgar Peeping Tom. How can you dare?  He is simply a man who is wound and unable to displace, and by this cause his only hobby consists just in taking a little bit around here and there. The illusion through the window is basically the same experience between the viewer and the screen. Window and screen mean the possibility of watching other different realities from the other side of the street.Someway Hitchcock suggestively reminds us but always keeping a discrete distance .But that hazardous Peeping Tom activity has its risks and demands its prize. This occurs when he is the involuntary eyewitness of a murder. And suddenly our beloved friend becomes hunted due its hobby.The rest runs for you my dear reader. A love affair is the secondary argumental line and the huge stage of several open windows seem to work out as a multiple stage. So the camera is a nervous eye until the moment our hero is watched by the assasin.

Rear window embodies that Hitchcock trademark beautifully. James Stewart plays Jeff, a photographer confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg. Thelma Ritter plays his wry, helpful nurse, Stella, and Grace Kelly is stunning as Jeff's sophisticated, intelligent, graceful girlfriend Lisa. Bored by being in his apartment all the time while recuperating, he passes time by watching his neighbors: a dancer, a lonely woman, a newly married couple...and a salesman with a nagging, bedridden wife. The salesman is Lars Thorwald, played by the lumbering Raymond Burr. When his wife disappears, Jeff is convinced that Lars had something to do with her disappearance, and is convinced she has been murdered. Jeff must depend on the help of Lisa and Stella to prove Thorwald guilty of the crime. This film left me speechless. I've always loved Hitchcock, but this is by far my favorite. The entire movie takes place in a small apartment, helping the viewer to feel the same claustrophobic desperation James Stewarts character feels throughout the entire film. This is a must see for any Hitchcock fan; the tense fear in the film is powerful, yet it is softened by the tender serene beauty of Grace Kelly.

But for the most part, that's all it was. And you know a movie is excellent when it keeps your attention for that long when it's simple dialogue, seemingly simple shots, and relatively few special effects. It must have actually been very difficult to film. Jimmy Stewart was actually reacting to NOTHING. And yet, each reaction had to be subtly different.

203648,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6300183513,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 6]","This film has become a cult film with time. Everything seems to be at that level though the situation and plot are rather light. What is important here is that Hitchcock transforms this back yard and garden surrounded by buildings all around and a highly voyeuristic microcosm into a complete vision of human society with all its dramas, and its pleasures and joys. To transform such a small microcosm entirely closed onto itself into a vision of the whole society we hardly get a couple of glimpses of through an alley opening onto the main street is marvelous and amazing. The second phenomenal fact is that the main actor is a wheelchair-ridden man with a severely broken leg in a cast. How can the whole world completely turn and whirl around that sole man? It is only possible because it is absolutely seen through the only eyes of this man or the eyes of the people standing next to him. There is only one instance when the point of vision is not his own eyes but a point outside in the yard-garden: at the end when he is being dropped from his window and then we get for a very short period of time the vision from the cops' eyes. This gives to that film such a personal dimension that it is nearly sickening: we have the impression of invading the privacy of that man. In fact what I have just said is false because he alternates what the man can see and close-up shots on him to show his personal reactions to what he has just seen. This constant alternating of voyeuristic sequences from the eyes of one man and close-up shots on his body language and language forces us into his own skin, body, bones. We are no longer voyeurs but ghosts in him seeing through his eyes. We are the direct witnesses of what he sees because we see it with him, through his own eyes and we start feeling the same emotions as he does. Of course everything is seen through the camera, but Hitchcock even uses some tools to emphasize the voyeuristic dimension and force us into it: a camera with a zooming lens that is so big that the camera becomes minuscule, or binoculars that are of course too big for the distance across the back yard and later the flash bulbs to force us not to see through the eyes of the murderer but to be seen through the eyes of the murderer. The last point I would like to insist on is that Hitchcock shows a murder but he is not interested in the murder per se but in the reactions of the witnesses, those who see everything and how they are blind to what they see. Then he builds up the slow recognition in their eyes, language and behavior, and then they become obsessive about it, to the point of becoming if not courageous at least unconscious of the risks they are taking or running. That too is remarkable and that nearly makes us get out of the simplistic voyeurism I have spoken of all along and climb into some kind of distantiation from the penned up impression of before, a distantiation that leads us to the idea that courage in a human society is often the result of a conviction that makes us blind to the danger or risk we are facing. Courage is the result of a lack of consciousness more than intensified consciousness. This is the human dimension Hitchcock always brought to his films. And that is kind of lost in our modern action films that do not have one single second now and then to just rest and digest what has happened before.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,A British eye spying on America,1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,3506,"['film', 'become', 'cult', 'film', 'time', 'Everything', 'be', 'level', 'situation', 'plot', 'are', 'rather', 'light', 'What', 'important', 'here', 'Hitchcock', 'back', 'yard', 'garden', 'surrounded', 'buildings', 'around', 'highly', 'voyeuristic', 'microcosm', 'complete', 'vision', 'human', 'society', 'dramas', 'pleasures', 'joys', 'transform', 'small', 'microcosm', 'entirely', 'closed', 'vision', 'whole', 'society', 'hardly', 'get', 'couple', 'glimpses', 'alley', 'opening', 'main', 'street', 'marvelous', 'amazing', 'second', 'phenomenal', 'fact', 'main', 'actor', 'wheelchair-ridden', 'man', 'severely', 'broken', 'leg', 'cast', 'How', 'can', 'whole', 'world', 'completely', 'turn', 'whirl', 'sole', 'man', 'only', 'possible', 'absolutely', 'seen', 'only', 'eyes', 'man', 'eyes', 'people', 'standing', 'next', 'only', 'one', 'instance', 'when', 'point', 'vision', 'not', 'own', 'eyes', 'point', 'yard-garden', 'end', 'when', 'being', 'dropped', 'window', 'then', 'get', 'very', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'vision', 'cops', 'eyes', 'film', 'personal', 'dimension', 'nearly', 'sickening', 'have', 'impression', 'invading', 'privacy', 'man', 'fact', 'what', 'have', 'just', 'said', 'false', 'what', 'man', 'can', 'see', 'close-up', 'shots', 'show', 'personal', 'reactions', 'what', 'just', 'seen', 'constant', 'alternating', 'voyeuristic', 'sequences', 'eyes', 'one', 'man', 'close-up', 'shots', 'body', 'language', 'language', 'forces', 'own', 'skin', 'body', 'bones', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'voyeurs', 'ghosts', 'seeing', 'eyes', 'are', 'direct', 'witnesses', 'what', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'start', 'feeling', 'same', 'emotions', 'course', 'everything', 'seen', 'camera', 'Hitchcock', 'even', 'tools', 'emphasize', 'voyeuristic', 'dimension', 'force', 'camera', 'zooming', 'lens', 'so', 'big', 'camera', 'minuscule', 'binoculars', 'are', 'course', 'too', 'big', 'distance', 'back', 'yard', 'later', 'flash', 'bulbs', 'force', 'not', 'see', 'eyes', 'murderer', 'be', 'seen', 'eyes', 'murderer', 'last', 'point', 'would', 'like', 'insist', 'Hitchcock', 'murder', 'not', 'interested', 'murder', 'se', 'reactions', 'witnesses', 'who', 'see', 'everything', 'how', 'are', 'blind', 'what', 'see', 'Then', 'up', 'slow', 'recognition', 'eyes', 'language', 'behavior', 'then', 'become', 'obsessive', 'point', 'becoming', 'not', 'courageous', 'least', 'unconscious', 'risks', 'are', 'taking', 'running', 'too', 'remarkable', 'nearly', 'get', 'simplistic', 'voyeurism', 'have', 'spoken', 'climb', 'kind', 'distantiation', 'penned', 'up', 'impression', 'before', 'distantiation', 'idea', 'courage', 'human', 'society', 'often', 'result', 'conviction', 'blind', 'danger', 'risk', 'are', 'facing', 'Courage', 'result', 'lack', 'consciousness', 'more', 'intensified', 'consciousness', 'human', 'dimension', 'Hitchcock', 'always', 'brought', 'films', 'kind', 'lost', 'modern', 'action', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'one', 'single', 'second', 'now', 'then', 'just', 'rest', 'digest', 'what', 'happened', 'before.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Rear Window VHS
203649,A1345VRK5MYG7,6300183513,James L.,"[1, 1]","In Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, we view from a distance and up close a number of people trapped in their lives:  the struggling songwriter, the woman looking for companionship, the salesman and his invalid wife, and a photographer confined to a wheelchair following an accident, looking at all the other trapped people through his window into theirs.  James Stewart is that photographer, a man who has become more of a voyeur than he wants to admit.  He's feeling trapped by his wheelchair, but also by his relationship with beautiful rich girl, Grace Kelly.  And then he begins to suspect that one of the neighbours has committed a murder, and from his perch at his window, he begins to piece it altogether.  Rear Window is an amazing film.  Like he was in Lifeboat, Hitchcock is limited to a small physical space to play out his action, and he does it here with even more success.  The suspense, the suspicions, and the evidence builds gradually in a plot perfectly paced for maximum effect.  Stewart gives a very assured performance here, just as effective in his reaction shots as he is delivering dialogue.  Kelly is sophisticated, beautiful, and very real in her performance, and both are matched by the always great Thelma Ritter as the to-the-point nurse who visits daily, and who also becomes involved in the goings on.  This is clearly one of Hitchcock's top achievements - a smart, romantic, sexy, funny, scary, mystery film that delivers on all those levels.

203652,A26KUECUNU825F,6300183513,jcd,"[1, 14]","Just saw the glorious ""North by Northwest"" on the big screen at a local rep house, and browsing online reviews afterwards (""Top Ten Films of the '50s,"" etc.), I was startled to see that ""Rear Window"" actually made more ""best of"" lists than ""NXNW.""So--my faith in my fellow film-goers' good sense shaken to the core--I'm writing this brief review to throw some critical cold water on the idea that the competent but undistinguished ""Rear Window"" could ever deserve mention in the same breath with really first-rate Hitchcock, like ""NXNW,"" ""Vertigo"" or ""Psycho.""""Rear Window"" is a stagy, stodgy piece of '50s mass entertainment. (The villain is Raymond Burr, for god's sake!) It's always struck me as one of those conservative, big-box-office-targeted popcorn movies that directors make to keep their Hollywood hitmaker cred--like, say, Warren Beatty's ""Heaven Can Wait"" or Scorsese's Howard Hughes bio-pic.Don't get me wrong--""Rear Window"" isn't a bad film at all. It's cleverly conceived and written, in an old-fashioned well-made play sort of way. (The hero, stuck in a little bachelor apartment with a broken leg, spies a possible murder out his back window and has to catch the bad guy without ever leaving his room.) It's carefully plotted to dole out the suspense spoonful by spoonful, and has the requisite colorful minor characters--mostly quirky neighbors noted from afar through Jimmy Stewart's nosy binoculars.But it's one of Hitchcock's least personally-stamped films. Though there are some nice touches--it cocks an impudent eye at film's inherent voyeurism--more than any other movie of Hitchcock's great mature period, it seems a filmed version of somebody else's work. Like a stage play brought to the screen, say, though I know it wasn't that. (The screenplay was based on a short story.)Jimmy Stewart is a bit miscast as a hard-boiled war-and-disaster photographer; trying to play hard-bitten, he's wooden. And maybe it's me, but the opposites-attract, mildly troubled romance with society-girl-to-the-max Grace Kelly left me yawning, even rolling my eyes at times. (Yes, she sure is purty.)Now, contrast that with ""North by Northwest""'s infectious filmic dynamism, from the classic crop-duster sequence that uses the screen so amazingly, to Eva Marie Saint's suavely torrid seduction of Cary Grant on the 20th Century Ltd., to the stunning finale literally all over Mt. Rushmore. And note how brilliantly all that deeply pleasurable inventiveness paints the movie's theme--of American individualism  embattled in an era of mass commercialism and Cold War deceit--right across an iconic American landscape. No mistaking a masterwork; nobody but Hitchcock.Sorry, but comparing ""Rear Window"" with a really great piece of Hitchcockian filmmaking like ""NXNW""--or ""Vertigo"" or ""Psycho,"" films that changed the whole terrain of film--does NOT work to ""Rear Window""'s advantage.

Jeffries (James Stewart) is a dashing photographer who usually spends his time out in the field getting the most exciting and difficult shots.  Unfortunately, while he got a fantastic photo of a crashing race car, he also got a busted leg and is laid up in his second floor apartment in a cast.  For seven weeks (and one more to go) he's had nothing to do but watch the neighbors whose apartment windows all surround the same courtyard.  But very late one night he hears a scream and notices one neighbor (a salesman) making repeated trips out into the rain with a large samples case and his nagging wife has disappeared.  Jeffries becomes convinced the man killed her.The entire movie is shown from the point of view from Jeffries' apartment, and illustrates perfectly Hitchcock's genius.  He tells the story by what he shows with the camera (pay attention to the very clever opening sequence for a good example), by what Jeffries sees and does, and what you see of the neighbors.  Has a murder really been committed?  Hitchcock interjects subtle humor throughout, from Jeffries and the various neighbors, such as ""Miss Lonelyheart"" or ""The Newlyweds.""  And when Hitchcock decides to turn on the suspence, he turns it on all the way.  One part I found slightly unbelievable is Jeffries' resistance to his beautiful girlfriend (Grace Kelly) who offers repeated hints about marriage.  C'mon, Grace Kelly?!?  What's he waiting for?But it's all part of Hitchcock's larger theme here, and this movie was lots of fun to watch noting how clever Hitchcock is and looking for his cameo appearance (and I'm not really much of a film buff).

From his rear window, he is able to look out in the courtyard of the apartments around him and into the windows of other apartments. He becomes voyeur looking into to the lives of other people because he cannot get out on his own and he is bored with it. During the course of his vicarious living, he becomes suspicious about a neighbor and comes to believe that he is a murderer but nobody at first will believe him. Gradually, others come around but danger looms when the crook realizes that he is being watched.This has become something of a signature role for Jimmy Stewart. He gives a very creditable performance with only a single flaw. He is bored with life and bored with his adoring, socialite, beautiful and intelligent girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly. He displays ebullient, angry, pensive, playful and sarcastic moods well but he never quite manages to be convincing when he is bored with Grace Kelly.

203666,A168VXSISJWQN9,6300183513,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[0, 0]","Alfred Hitchcock had a unique style and his films are readily identifiable. High on the list is 'Rear Window', which contains several of Hitchcock's trademarks.First on the list is that Hitchcock's approach to mystery thrillers is quite different to most writers and filmmakers (to those who say that Hitchcock didn't write his movies, I can only say that a military commander doesn't fight his battles, but he controls those who do!). Usually in other people's mysteries a cast of characters is paraded in front of the viewer and the game is to guess which one is the murderer. In Hitchcock's films, it's pretty obvious who the murderer is, the question is how to pin the crime on them- preferably before they do it again. In 'Rear Window' Hitchcock plays up this aspect of the movie to its utmost, giving the lead male character a handicap which means that he can't do anything himself and has to act through others. Hitch builds the tension to an edge-of-the seat climax, in which both male and female leads are in mortal danger. Do they survive? Watch and find out.Then there's the claustrophobic setting. Many of Hitchcock's movies are developed from plays, but even when they aren't ('Rear Window' was developed from a short story), he tends to eschew large-scale settings and has the action take place in confined (literally in this case) quarters. This adds to the tension; anyone who has had a nightmare in which it seems impossible to escape a terrifying situation will know the feeling of paralysing fear that is induced and Hitchcock creates that feeling better than any other filmmaker. Much of this movie takes place within a single room, with the world outside observed as though it were on TV. When the TV world intrudes on the lives of the lead characters, they can't escape.Hitchcock liked to work with actors (and crew) with whom he felt comfortable and this movie contains a number of Hitch stalwarts, most notably James Stewart and Grace Kelly in the leading roles. They interpret their characters splendidly and are backed up by the feisty Thelma Ritter, adding light relief. There is also a group of characters whose job is create atmosphere by being observed going about their daily business and Hitchcock makes sure their stories, comical, tragic and sometimes embarrassing, are entertaining enough to make watching them seem a justifiable pastime.Hitchcock's films are always worth watching for entertainment, but the more you see them, the more you appreciate the technique of one of the cinema's greatest storytellers.",5,The Hitchcock style,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,2546,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'unique', 'style', 'films', 'are', 'readily', 'identifiable', 'High', 'list', ""'Rear"", 'Window', 'several', 'Hitchcock', 'trademarks.First', 'list', 'Hitchcock', 'approach', 'mystery', 'thrillers', 'quite', 'different', 'most', 'writers', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'say', 'Hitchcock', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'movies', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'military', 'commander', ""n't"", 'fight', 'battles', 'who', 'do', 'Usually', 'other', 'people', 'mysteries', 'cast', 'characters', 'paraded', 'front', 'viewer', 'game', 'guess', 'one', 'murderer', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'who', 'murderer', 'question', 'how', 'pin', 'crime', 'them-', 'preferably', 'do', 'again', ""'Rear"", 'Window', 'Hitchcock', 'up', 'aspect', 'movie', 'utmost', 'giving', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'handicap', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'act', 'others', 'Hitch', 'tension', 'edge-of-the', 'seat', 'climax', 'male', 'female', 'leads', 'are', 'mortal', 'danger', 'Do', 'survive', 'Watch', 'find', 'out.Then', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'Many', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'are', 'developed', 'plays', 'even', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", ""'Rear"", 'Window', 'was', 'developed', 'short', 'story', 'eschew', 'large-scale', 'settings', 'action', 'take', 'place', 'confined', 'literally', 'case', 'quarters', 'tension', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'nightmare', 'impossible', 'escape', 'terrifying', 'situation', 'will', 'know', 'feeling', 'paralysing', 'fear', 'induced', 'Hitchcock', 'feeling', 'better', 'other', 'filmmaker', 'Much', 'movie', 'place', 'single', 'room', 'world', 'outside', 'observed', 'were', 'TV', 'When', 'TV', 'world', 'lives', 'lead', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape.Hitchcock', 'liked', 'work', 'actors', 'crew', 'whom', 'felt', 'comfortable', 'movie', 'number', 'Hitch', 'stalwarts', 'most', 'notably', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'leading', 'roles', 'interpret', 'characters', 'splendidly', 'are', 'backed', 'up', 'feisty', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'adding', 'light', 'relief', 'also', 'group', 'characters', 'job', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'being', 'observed', 'going', 'daily', 'business', 'Hitchcock', 'sure', 'stories', 'comical', 'tragic', 'sometimes', 'embarrassing', 'are', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'make', 'watching', 'seem', 'justifiable', 'pastime.Hitchcock', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'worth', 'watching', 'entertainment', 'more', 'see', 'more', 'appreciate', 'technique', 'one', 'cinema', 'greatest', 'storytellers']",Rear Window VHS

If you want to know the entire plot, read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.I find Rear Window (1954) to be entertaining, fun, suspenseful, and a little scary at times all rolled into one.  The biggest reason why I like this movie is because Grace Kelly is in it.  She was a looker and her performance in this movie was Oscar-worthy.  She plays the role of Lisa Carol Fremont, who is the girlfriend of L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, played by Jimmy Stewart.  Stewart's performance was also great.  Grace Kelly reminds me so much of Nicole Kidman, or should I say that Nicole Kidman reminds me of Grace Kelly.  Kidman's overall look she had in The Others (2001) is so similar to Kelly's look in Rear Window, especially during the early part of Rear Window.  Kidman's character name coincidentally in The Others is Grace Stewart.This movie takes place entirely in an apartment complex where the rear windows of all apartments are open and expose what is going on inside each apartment that overlooks a courtyard.  It's funny to watch Jimmy Stewart's character take part in voyeurism.  But his voyeurism pays off as he and several people are able to solve a murder that took place in an apartment across the courtyard.  The suspense builds as the movie progresses.This DVD is in widescreen format.  The extras are excellent.  There is a documentary called Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic, which describes the making of the movie with interviews with cast and crew, Hitchcock himself through an audio interview, and Hitchcock's daughter.

It's a simple, yet incredibly elaborate film that will make you laugh, excite you, and marvel about how hot Grace Kelly was. Everyone knows the plot of the movie for the most part; James Stewart plays L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, a photographer confined to a wheelchair after suffering a broken leg. Apparently he hasn't heard of a TV, so he spends his days looking out the window at his neighbors. After a series of coincidences, he believes that his neighbor has killed his wife. With the help of his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), detective/friend Doyle (Wendell Corey), and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) he begins to uncover the mystery. This movie is a few minutes shy of two hours and is never dull...For a movie like this, that definitely takes some talent. First of all, the movie keeps throwing curveballs at you which make you question whether his neighbor is innocent or guilty. But even watching it today, it's not cliched. The subject of the film alone is fascinating; Voyeurism. Everyone is a voyeur, so the whole idea of voyeurism (especially when placed on film) can be fascinating and it's really fascinating here. Hitchcock manages to keep the suspense going, while occasionally making you laugh. The scene where Lisa and Stella go down to dig up the flowerbed and Lisa eventually sneaks into the neighbors apartment are truly great moments. James Stewart delivers one of his best performances. Rear Window holds the #42 spot on the American Film Institute's Top 100. The only Hitchcock film it ranks below is Psycho. If you like thought-provoking, slow moving suspense films. Check out Rear Window.

With this movie, Hitchcock, fantastic bully that he was, forces those of us who consider ourselves  &quot;decent&quot;  (whatever that means)  to confront the nasty voyeur within.  Of course, those who cheerfully admit being voyeurs will absolutely adore  &quot;Rear Window&quot;.  In case you haven't seen it, it's about a professional photographer  (the ever-solid James Stewart)  who's laid up with a broken leg.  Out of boredom, he begins peering into other people's apartments across the courtyard, using a comically large camera lens  (torpedo would be an apter description).  Naturally  (for this is a Hitchcock picture), he sees something in one of the apartments which leads him to believe that a certain man  (Raymond Burr)  has done away with his wife.The story is top-notch; but what will really impress the movie-lover is the sheer technical brilliance here.  Almost the entire film is one long-shot -- and from a first-person point of view, at that.  Astonishing.  The Master is not known particularly for his visual finesse  (I keep thinking of  *Suspicion*, with that ridiculous  &quot;spider-web&quot;  shadow from the window-panes all over the inside of Joan Fontaine's house), but here his concepts are boldly conceived and fortunately executed.  Further, the DVD version looks smashing -- obviously supervised by a technical wizard.  Indeed, this 46-year-old movie looks sharper and fresher than most movies released last year  (think  *Gladiator*, with its murky computerized palettes).*Rear Window*  is a masterpiece, natch.

James Stewart is fantastic as the recuperating photographer who cannot find anything to do except watch the comings and goings of people in his apartment block. Thelma Ritter, as his nurse/housekeeper, has some of the best one-liners. And Grace Kelly as his love interest is in truly stunning form - both in terms of her acting and physical presence (I think I fell in love with her when I first saw this movie - and I was only 10 years old).If you want to know what all the fuss is about when it comes to movies of this era, do get this - you will enter a world of sophistication you might never have known existed.

Voyerism, wit and suspense are all well played and along with Jimmy's great performance, there is the amazing Grace Kelly and Ramond Burr as the surly neighbour who may, or may not have killed his wife. Franz Waxman's musical score adds a tense layer of gripping suspense, with one of the scores where the music is the 5th character. Everything about the film is brilliant.

He has broken his leg and is laid up inside his upper floor apartment. All he can do is sit inside with his leg propped up looking out with his huge camera lens (he's a photo journalist) onto the courtyard of his apartment building and into the windows of the one across from him.  Using his special lens he watches a young, curvy dancer, a lonely lady practicing for a hoped for date, a piano playing composer and others. One night he falls asleep and wakes up at the sound of a scream coming from one of the apartments across from him. The jewelry salesman, played by Raymond Burr (Perry Mason) is acting suspiciously and his bedridden wife has disappeared. Did he kill her? The beautifully, elegant Grace Kelly plays Stewart's girlfriend who wears high end fashion and has dinner brought to his apartment from one of the finest restaurants in the city! Even the handbag she brings to Stewart's apartment one night that turns into a suitcase with a negligee, robe and slippers is still talked about today! Watch as she helps Stewart solve the case. I also want to mention Thelma Ritter  who plays his nurse.  She is a great character actress whose comic, sarcastic wit is like a dash of curry powder in a stew.

203694,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6300183513,Lawyeraau,"[44, 52]","This is a superlative film of suspense. It is a tribute to the direction of Alfred Hitchcock that one is never bored watching this film, though it entirely takes place within the confines of a claustrophobic New York Greenwich Village apartment,  the windows of the neighbors across the way, and a courtyard that separates the buildings.Professional photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is recovering from an accident that occurred while on assignment. Encased in a cast covering his left leg and hip, Jeff is pretty much immobilized and temporarily confined to a wheel chair. Despite regular visits by his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, sophisticated girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), Jeff is chafing at his confinement. Bored stiff, he does what he does best. He peers at those around him from his window. Jeff finds the lives of his neighbors both  immensely interesting and amusing. He watches them through their windows and in the courtyard, enhancing his experience with binoculars and the zoom lens of his camera. Jeff draws inferences and  conclusions about them, based upon his own experiences with human behavior.This interest intensifies and takes a strange turn, when he believes one of them, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), may have committed a grisly murder, killing off his invalid wife, Anna. Though Jeff never actually sees the murder, what he does see is its aftermath and some peculiar behavior that puzzles him.  Putting two and two together, he becomes absolutely convinced that his neighbor across the way has done away with his invalid wife. Jeff then informally involves his friend, Lt. Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) of the New York City Police Department, who initially scoffs at Jeff's assessment, though he does a cursory check . With Lisa and Stella also becoming fascinated by the strange behavior of Lars Thorwald, their interest and amateur sleuthing  propels the film to an exciting climax.Jimmy Stewart is terrific as the housebound voyeur, drawing the viewer in with him. One finds oneself peering along with him into the lives of those around him. Grace Kelly is stunningly beautiful as Jeff's girlfriend Lisa, with whom Jeff is finding it difficult to make a commitment. It is interesting that as Jeff gets more intimately engrossed in his neighbors' affairs, his intimacy with Lisa seems to grow, drawing them closer together. Thelma Ritter is funny and sassy as the tough talking, no nonsense nurse. Raymond Burr, looking eerily as he would half a century later, is well cast as the neighbor whose wife got on his nerves. Wendell Corey is very good as the congenial, though jaded, detective.All in all, this is a terrific film that clearly shows the mastery and deft direction of the legendary Hitchcock. With a well written script and a stellar cast, this is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.

Seeing it again, I'm reminded of the way things used to be, and it is certainly worthwhile as a retro experience.  It's interesting to see the clothing styles and the dial telephones.  There's also a mystery that kept me interested.Jimmy Stewart is cast in the role of a photographer with a broken leg.  He's confined to his apartment which is supposed to be in New York's Greenwich village.  From his window, he observes his neighbors.  And the apartment house across the street just happens to be designed in a way that he can look into the windows of all the apartments and get a bird's eye view into the lives other people's lives.  Every day a nurse, played by Thelma Ritter, comes to look in on him.  She shares his interest in his neighbors and she counsels him about his love life.  It seems his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly, wants to marry him but he holds back because she is a society girl and he doubts if she can fit into his life of international travel to a wide variety of war-torn and isolated places.  But as the film progresses, she gets more and more involved in what he suspects is a murder in the apartment across the courtyard.  She's beautiful, of course, with an unnaturally tiny waistline which was the style in those days, and she plays her part well.  Raymond Burr is cast in the role of the supposed murderer.  Did he or did he not kill his wife?  This is the storyline that keeps the audience guessing.The plot moves swiftly and it certainly captured my interest.

Now we know that she finally believes his fantastical claim that the seemingly innocuous nearby apartment dweller (pre-Perry Mason Raymond Burr in a white wig)has in fact murdered his nagging invalid wife.Stewart has been laid up for weeks in his apartment with a leg cast, unable to pursue his adventurous life as a daredevil photographer. Bored, he has taken to watching the antics of the apartment dwellers across the way. Things look a little strange about Burr and his now-absent wife, so Stewart's long-dormant imagination takes him into a cat and mouse game with dangerous consequences.I like &quot;Rear Window&quot; quite a lot: the speaking actors are all first-rate, like the aforementioned Stewart and Kelly, and also reliable Thelma Ritter as the visiting nurse who has her own pet theories about where &quot;things&quot; might be buried. Then there's a  pile of non-speaking actors, the pantomine players comprising the apartment dwellers, whose skill makes the whole movie work. Costuming for Grace is great, too; there are numerous occasions for her to spin about in haute couture outfits while trying to tempt the wheelchair bound Stewart away from his voyeuristic habits.If you've ever tried to piece together what the folks across the courtyard from you are doing, whether behind drawn shades or out in plain sight, throw open &quot;Rear Window&quot; and take a peek.",5,Tell me everything you saw--and what you think it all means!,1008806400,"12 20, 2001",2001,1534,"['When', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'utters', 'line', 'James', 'Stewart', 'gaze', 'riveted', 'window', 'watching', 'goings-on', 'back', 'courtyard', 'Now', 'know', 'finally', 'fantastical', 'claim', 'seemingly', 'innocuous', 'nearby', 'apartment', 'dweller', 'pre-Perry', 'Mason', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'white', 'wig', 'fact', 'murdered', 'nagging', 'invalid', 'wife.Stewart', 'been', 'laid', 'up', 'weeks', 'apartment', 'leg', 'cast', 'unable', 'pursue', 'adventurous', 'life', 'daredevil', 'photographer', 'Bored', 'taken', 'watching', 'antics', 'apartment', 'dwellers', 'way', 'Things', 'look', 'little', 'strange', 'Burr', 'now-absent', 'wife', 'Stewart', 'long-dormant', 'imagination', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'dangerous', 'consequences.I', 'quot', 'Rear', 'Window', 'quot', 'quite', 'lot', 'speaking', 'actors', 'are', 'first-rate', 'aforementioned', 'Stewart', 'Kelly', 'also', 'reliable', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'visiting', 'nurse', 'who', 'own', 'pet', 'theories', 'where', 'quot', 'things', 'quot', 'might', 'be', 'buried', 'Then', 'pile', 'non-speaking', 'actors', 'pantomine', 'players', 'comprising', 'apartment', 'dwellers', 'skill', 'whole', 'movie', 'work', 'Costuming', 'Grace', 'great', 'too', 'are', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'spin', 'about', 'haute', 'couture', 'outfits', 'trying', 'tempt', 'wheelchair', 'Stewart', 'away', 'voyeuristic', 'habits.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'tried', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'folks', 'courtyard', 'are', 'doing', 'drawn', 'shades', 'out', 'plain', 'sight', 'throw', 'open', 'quot', 'Rear', 'Window', 'quot', 'take', 'peek']",Rear Window VHS

It is suspenseful and interesting even over 50 years later. It touches on issues we face in our current times. And, perhaps more amazingly, it manages to pass the Bechdel test, something that few AFI movies manage to do! It has two strong, named female characters who talk to each other about a topic other than men. Most movies fail this simple test. In Rear Window, Hitchcock provides equal strength and time to both the females and males in the story line.Stewart is a photographer stuck in a wheelchair, resigned to peering out his windows at his neighbors. In our modern times this might seem a casual thing. Heck, we know the second-by-second details of our far off friends thanks to Twitter and Facebook. However, in the 50s this was considered less of a normal thing to do. He's even scolded by people around him for intruding on their privacy. Amazingly, we really do come to care about these people around him, even though they don't have names. The sad, lonely woman who eats alone and gets roughed up by a guy she brings home. The newlywed couple who goes from bliss to bickering. The loving couple with their cute little dog.Even when Stewart gets concerned about an invalid wife who seems to go missing, he's still being caught up in all the dramas around him. The song-writing guy and his piano. The ballerina with her bevy of admirers. The whole courtyard is fascinating.I love how Kelly shows her strength and surprises him with her independence. I also cringe when her quite astute observations are dismissed as ""women's intuition"" - as if they are not based on logic.I do find the ending to be a bit contrived. The killer was an extremely logical, methodical man who planned out every last detail of what he was doing. He knew there were multiple people aware of what was going on. Why in the world would he try to kill just one of them? Surely that would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt his guilt? Why not take off to safety? To me that's the one false note in this story.

James Stewart plays a photographer confined to a wheelchair, and, because he is bored, he voyeuristically examines the lives of his neighbors in the apartment building. We only see these neighbors through his eyes. Therefore, when he assumes that the man across the courtyard has murdered his invalid wife, at first no one wants to investigate his theory, especially his detective friend. But the clues seem to pile up, leading Stewart's girlfriend and nurse (a wonderfully witty role played by Thelma Ritter) to lure the man from his apartment to investigate further. The climax is powerful, true to Hitchcockian form.Hitchcock's films are quite different from suspense films made today. The primary difference is the method in which Hitch crafts suspense. It's slow--on purpose. The climax is more powerful because the viewer builds up tension throughout the first 3/4 of the film. In this movie, Hitch's goal is not to shock or horrify viewers, but put them on the edge of their seats in anxious expectation of the climax.

I'm much older than the first time I saw it, which was probably 25 years ago, and it still held up very well despite my being a lot older and (hopefully) a bit more knowledgeable about film and cinema.The movie is really about the voyeur in all of us, the only difference being that, in the case of Stewart's character, Jeff, this isn't just the occasionally harmless voyeuristic act of which we are all guilty sometimes.  No. in this case, what starts out as a passive, casual pastime becomes a two-edge sword as Jeff follows his voyeuristic obsession to a nearly fatal end.Being a photographer, Jeff was already in a voyeuristic profession, so Hitchcock's choosing a photographer as the main character makes sense. As Jeff is confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg he has few opportunities for diversion other than pensively looking out his apartment window at the rest of the tenants in his apartment building. The only problem is, he starts noticing some disturbing clues and from there he is drawn into a risky game of cat and mouse with Raymond Burr's character, putting both himself and Grace Kelly's character in danger.Looking out his rear window, Stewart casually observes the mundane lives of his fellow apartment dwellers, most of whom appear completely normal and of nothing more than passing interest. Or are they? One seems to be hiding a deep, dark secret. Perhaps that is just the tip of the iceberg. Maybe Hitchcock is saying that we all have secrets and perhaps it's only luck that we don't get found out by a Jeff who just happened to look out his apartment window one morning at the fateful moment and catch us in the act.Ultimately the movie plays on the tension between the desire to be merely passive observers vs. the desire to act and participate in all of us. Most of the time, it's our behavior that gets us humans in trouble. In Rear Window, it starts out as a seemingly innocent pastime by an otherwise bored Stewart, but it's his willingness to follow that wherever it leads that provides the suspense and drama here.The whole cast turns in fine performances and there's not a false note anywhere. Burr is great as the bad guy who brings a quiet intensity to his role. This is a movie that stands up to repeated viewing and deserves its reputation as a true Hitchcock classic.",5,A true classic about the voyeur in all of us,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,2668,"['Please', 'note', 'saw', 'movie', 'channel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'features.As', 'are', 'already', 'almost', '400', 'reviews', 'great', 'classic', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'able', 'add', 'anything', 'say', 'seeing', 'movie', 'recently', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'stood', 'up', ""'m"", 'much', 'older', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'probably', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'held', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'being', 'lot', 'older', 'hopefully', 'bit', 'more', 'knowledgeable', 'film', 'cinema.The', 'movie', 'really', 'voyeur', 'only', 'difference', 'being', 'case', 'Stewart', 'character', 'Jeff', ""n't"", 'just', 'occasionally', 'harmless', 'voyeuristic', 'act', 'are', 'guilty', 'sometimes', 'No', 'case', 'what', 'out', 'passive', 'casual', 'pastime', 'two-edge', 'sword', 'Jeff', 'voyeuristic', 'obsession', 'nearly', 'fatal', 'end.Being', 'photographer', 'Jeff', 'was', 'already', 'voyeuristic', 'profession', 'Hitchcock', 'choosing', 'photographer', 'main', 'character', 'sense', 'Jeff', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'breaking', 'leg', 'few', 'opportunities', 'diversion', 'other', 'pensively', 'looking', 'out', 'apartment', 'window', 'rest', 'tenants', 'apartment', 'building', 'only', 'problem', 'noticing', 'disturbing', 'clues', 'drawn', 'risky', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'character', 'putting', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'character', 'danger.Looking', 'out', 'rear', 'window', 'Stewart', 'casually', 'mundane', 'lives', 'fellow', 'apartment', 'dwellers', 'most', 'whom', 'appear', 'completely', 'normal', 'nothing', 'more', 'passing', 'interest', 'are', 'One', 'be', 'hiding', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'Maybe', 'Hitchcock', 'saying', 'have', 'secrets', 'perhaps', 'only', 'luck', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'found', 'out', 'Jeff', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'look', 'out', 'apartment', 'window', 'one', 'morning', 'fateful', 'moment', 'catch', 'act.Ultimately', 'movie', 'tension', 'desire', 'be', 'merely', 'passive', 'observers', 'desire', 'act', 'participate', 'Most', 'time', 'behavior', 'humans', 'trouble', 'Rear', 'Window', 'out', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'pastime', 'otherwise', 'bored', 'Stewart', 'willingness', 'follow', 'wherever', 'suspense', 'drama', 'here.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'fine', 'performances', 'not', 'false', 'note', 'anywhere', 'Burr', 'great', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'role', 'movie', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'reputation', 'true', 'Hitchcock', 'classic']",Rear Window VHS

It's one of those movies one can watch over and over throughout the years and never get tired of. It's a movie you grow old with, like a beloved spouse.It's great entertainment, but the questions that are posed by it are eternal, like the meaning of privacy for instance, more valid than ever at this age of big brother and paparazzi; or how you can love someone with all your heart who doesn't fit in your universe and your way of life. Stewart's argument with the nurse (amazingly played by Thelma Ritter in what may very well be the role of her career) upon that very subject is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen on film. The movie would be worth it for that alone.He proves the world over and over again that, just like his movies tend to be about bringing two lovers together and how that is achieved is ultimately unimportant, the eroticism between them is not about how much skin or graphic sex you're shown.

From the rear window of his New York apartment &quot;Jeff&quot; can see the going's on of many of his neighbors - &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;, a middle-aged lady who seems unlucky in love,  &quot;The Songwriter&quot; who plunks at his studio piano trying to come up with a hit, &quot;Miss Torso&quot; the dancer who entertains many men in between stretching her lithe body across the courtyard from our vantage-point.Jeffries also has a girlfriend, a socialite named Lisa Fremont who is played by Grace Kelly, and the Princess never looked more beautiful or graceful than in this film.  Her introduction into the movie is, in my humble opinion, the most beautiful &quot;close-up&quot; ever done, and when she kisses Jimmy Stewart how many men have wished that it were them?OH! Did I mention there is a spine-tingling mystery story mixed in with all of the above?  One of Jeffries neighbors is Lars Thorwald, played by Raymond Burr, who has an invalid wife who nags and belittles him.  One day the wife is gone.  Has she just gone on a visit?  Or has Mr. Thorwald had enough and done her in?  I won't answer that question, but I promise you'll be on the edge of your seat more than once as you find out.

This is a tale about a professional photographer, LB &quot;Jeff&quot; Jeffries (James Stewart), who is confined to a wheelchair in his two-roomed flat. He passes time by looking out of his window into the courtyard that backs several small apartment buildings. Jeff even give nicknames to some of the neighbours he watches, mostly to keep absolute bordem at bay. But things aren't quite so bad; he has a nurse who comes in daily to take care of him. Her name is Stella (Thelma Ritter). She makes a casual reference to his being a peeping-tom could get him into trouble for seeing things that he shouldn't see. And, even better, Jeff has a lovely girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), who is a number of years his junior. High-class and beautiful; Lisa doesn't care that Jeff is living from paycheque-to-paycheque. Eventually, Stella's warning comes true. Jeff discovers that a salesman (Lars Thorwald played by Raymond Burr), could very well be a murderer. He calls his friend, who is a policeman, to check out the situation. His friend can't; not without sufficient probable-cause. Many rather nasty things occur that Jeff sees but can't explain.

The acting is definitely the best part of this movie. I mean you can't really go wrong with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. But It is not enough to make this a good movie in my opinion. I believe this movie is shot all from one room. The movie is mostly dialogue between Stewart and whomever  is in his room at the time. During the times where there is no dialogue the camera is panning into the other windows of the courtyard. Stewart really doesn't have much evidence to go on but he is convinced one of his neighbors killed  his own wife. The movie builds and builds until we find out he is right.

One thing is outstanding and that is Jimmy Stewart. He is a photographer who broke his leg while on the job at a racing track. Strangely enough photos of the crash are in the opening scenes. Because he cannot move he is in his chair for the entire movie. The dialogue between him and his nurse is superb, especially the nurse has some great lines.He is dating the beautiful Grace Kelly who he thinks is just to perfect for him but she doesn't seem to mind. The dialogue between them sounds like that between two people who have known each other for a while. Words that bystanders might find horrible but they are perfectly happy with.While sitting in his chair Stewart has a chance to look outside his rear window at what is going on outside. There is a dancing lady, a composer, a sunbathing woman, a single woman and a just-married couple. This by the way for a long time was the biggest inside set ever built for a movie.  The thing he notices most however is a married couple and the story will be about them, since he thinks the man has killed the woman and is trying to get rid of the body everywhere. At first no one believes him, especially his friend a police officer. But the evidence gets more and more certain and more people start believing him, leading to a very tense end scene of the movie. This is of course, still a Hitchcock film.The great thing is that even as a viewer you are convinced that Stewart is wrong, he just seems to be a sad wheelchair bound man that can't wait for another week before the cast can come off. He scratches himself with a backscratcher while making crazy assumptions based on the scarce things he sees at the other side.It's a very funny movie too and that is especially in the dialogues between the people. An example: Gunderson: It's about time you got married, before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man. Jeff : Yeah, can't you just see me, rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife...  Gunderson: Jeff, wives don't nag anymore. They discuss.  Jeff : Oh, is that so, is that so? Well, maybe in the high-rent district they discuss. In my neighborhood they still nag.Rear Window is, together with North by Northwest, my favorite Hitchcock movie.

203717,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,6300183513,Mcgivern Owen L,"[2, 2]","""Rear Window"" is an extraordinarily clever movie. Though a thriller, it is fun to watch.  Alfred Hitchcock must have relished making it. RW is special in that there is only one location- Jimmy Stewart's rear-facing apartment. The ensuing claustrophobic effect only adds to the charm. Jimmy plays a big time ""Life Magazine"" photographer, laid up with a broken leg. With too much time on his hands, he spies on his neighbors in the building across the courtyard. What an assortment of cameras!  And what an assortment of characters! Each window holds a story. Just imagine the choreography the director had to manage. The ""neighbors"" include the struggling musician with strange friends and stranger parties, Miss Lonely Hearts, Miss Torso, the newlyweds, the couple with the little dog (!), and the man with the sickly wife. The husband, Raymond Burr, gives Stewart bad vibes right away. Some bizarre actions-and sounds (!)- emanating from that apartment leads Stewart to believe that Burr has killed the wife and disposed of her in a suitcase. In 1954, Burr still was cast as a bad guy. The problem is that no one listens to Jimmy. His ravishing girlfriend (Grace Kelly), his physical therapist (Thelma Ritter) and his detective buddy, (Wendell Corey) all think Jimmy has gone stir crazy from inactivity. Suddenly, in a pivotal nighttime moment, Kelly believes him! Dressed to the nines, she actually breaks into Burr's apartment! This reviewer won't divulge the resolution but Hitchcock does a masterful job in resolving the kaleidoscopic sagas of the vanishing wife and those wonderful folks in the windows. How grateful we are that they kept their shades up.  (Most of the time) It's delightful to think about how many subplots this classic movie has. Many praise Stewart's work in RW but this reviewer would shed the spotlight on Kelly, the perfect uptown girl, icy and sexy all at the same time. Watch for that second story job in an expensive calf length dress! RW was nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay but came away empty handed at Oscar time. Why it was not nominated for cinematography is a mystery- since RW is a photographic marvel Kelly did win the Oscar for her role in ""The Country Girl"".  The New York film Critics also bestowed on her their Best Actress Award for ""Rear Window"", ""The Country Girl"" and another Hitchcock classic-""Dial M for Murder"". 1954 was quite a year for Grace.  The Academy Awards may have passed RW by but movie fans should not. This is one of those films that get better with time and are more appealing on the fifth viewing than the first. The sheer visual effects alone mark RW as a jewel.",5,A Beautiful Classic!,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,2644,"['Rear', 'Window', 'extraordinarily', 'clever', 'movie', 'thriller', 'fun', 'watch', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'must', 'have', 'relished', 'making', 'RW', 'special', 'only', 'one', 'location-', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'rear-facing', 'apartment', 'ensuing', 'claustrophobic', 'effect', 'only', 'charm', 'Jimmy', 'big', 'time', 'Life', 'Magazine', 'photographer', 'laid', 'up', 'broken', 'leg', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'neighbors', 'building', 'courtyard', 'What', 'assortment', 'cameras', 'what', 'assortment', 'characters', 'window', 'story', 'Just', 'imagine', 'choreography', 'director', 'had', 'manage', 'neighbors', 'include', 'struggling', 'musician', 'strange', 'friends', 'stranger', 'parties', 'Miss', 'Lonely', 'Hearts', 'Miss', 'Torso', 'newlyweds', 'couple', 'little', 'dog', 'man', 'sickly', 'wife', 'husband', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'Stewart', 'bad', 'vibes', 'right', 'away', 'bizarre', 'actions-and', 'sounds', 'emanating', 'apartment', 'Stewart', 'believe', 'Burr', 'killed', 'wife', 'disposed', 'suitcase', '1954', 'Burr', 'still', 'was', 'cast', 'bad', 'guy', 'problem', 'one', 'Jimmy', 'ravishing', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'physical', 'therapist', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'detective', 'buddy', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'think', 'Jimmy', 'gone', 'stir', 'crazy', 'inactivity', 'Suddenly', 'pivotal', 'nighttime', 'moment', 'Kelly', 'Dressed', 'nines', 'actually', 'Burr', 'apartment', 'reviewer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'resolution', 'Hitchcock', 'masterful', 'job', 'resolving', 'kaleidoscopic', 'sagas', 'vanishing', 'wife', 'wonderful', 'folks', 'windows', 'How', 'grateful', 'are', 'kept', 'shades', 'up', 'Most', 'time', 'delightful', 'think', 'how', 'many', 'subplots', 'classic', 'movie', 'Many', 'praise', 'Stewart', 'work', 'RW', 'reviewer', 'would', 'shed', 'spotlight', 'Kelly', 'perfect', 'uptown', 'girl', 'icy', 'sexy', 'same', 'time', 'Watch', 'second', 'story', 'job', 'expensive', 'calf', 'length', 'dress', 'RW', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'came', 'away', 'empty', 'handed', 'Oscar', 'time', 'Why', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'cinematography', 'mystery-', 'RW', 'photographic', 'marvel', 'Kelly', 'did', 'win', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Country', 'Girl', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'Critics', 'also', 'bestowed', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Award', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Country', 'Girl', 'Hitchcock', 'classic-', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', '1954', 'was', 'quite', 'year', 'Grace', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'may', 'have', 'passed', 'RW', 'movie', 'fans', 'should', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'get', 'better', 'time', 'are', 'more', 'appealing', 'fifth', 'viewing', 'first', 'sheer', 'visual', 'effects', 'alone', 'mark', 'RW', 'jewel']",Rear Window VHS

203722,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,6300183513,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[7, 8]","Based on the Cornell Woolrich short story `It Had to be Murder' (penned under the name William Irish), director Alfred Hitchcock takes his long-time obsession with sexual voyeurism to an entirely new level. This time it revolves around a man left impotent, so-to-speak, from an accident (shown in the beginning in a photo from a car accident at a race track) which has left his leg broken and confines him to a wheelchair. The man's sole source of amusement and pleasure during the day (and occasionally in the evening) is intruding on his neighbors' privacy from the comfort of his apartment window and observing their daily lives. There are three frames in which the brilliant cinematography of the film is shaped. The first comes from the point-of-view of Mr. Hitchcock's motion-picture camera. The second is from Stewart's binoculars (only briefly) and his high-powered telephoto lens (meant of course to be sexually suggestive). And the third is straight from the window itself. Nearly every shot in Rear Window, with the exception of a few, are seen entirely from the point-of-view of James Stewart's character, Jeff. While confined in this solitary apartment building, the audience sees exactly what he sees; nothing more and nothing less. The audience is placed in the same emotional element as Jefferies, whether it is frustration, excitement, or fear. We are craning our necks just as he is to get even the tiniest glimpse of what we assume is taking place inside Thorwald's apartment - murder.Yet at the same time we the audience struggle with ourselves. We are all fully aware that human beings are not infallible and therefore are easily susceptible to jumping to conclusion for whatever reasons or motives, whether it stems from prejudice, ignorance, or something else entirely. This makes Lars Thorwald a sympathetic villain in a way. Ironically, Jefferies who jumps to the conclusion that Thorwald is guilty of murdering his own wife without any circumstantial evidence to prove it cautions Detective Doyle ""Careful, Tom"", as he glances at the contents of Lisa's suitcase which contains pink lingerie as if to suggest that she will staying the night at his place. All the same however we are still left with a sense of uneasiness. The scene in which Lars confronts Lisa and physically assaults her in his apartment before the police arrive on the scene is the precise moment which proves his guilt to us. Some may suggest rather that it is the death of the `dog who knew too much' but there was no direct proof he committed this violent crime, though audiences are meant to believe he did.Alfred Hitchcock brings up through the course of the film the analytical topic of `rear window ethics'. Is it right for a man or woman to spy on one's neighbor even if it turns out that the person is indeed guilt of murder? Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa, brings up this exact argument just when it seems as though their little investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. Thorwald has hit a dead-end. Then, moments later, a woman's scream is heard outside. The little dog which belonged to the couple living on the fire escape is found dead with its neck broken as if strangled. The distraught woman who owned the dog cries out, """"Which one of you did it? Which one of you killed my dog? You don't know the meaning of the word 'neighbor.' Neighbors like each other, speak to each other, care if anybody lives or dies, but none of you do"", as if to directly counter Lisa's argument a few minutes earlier.Nearly as entertaining and enthralling as the murder mystery which ultimately shapes the main course of the picture, the distinctive subplots of the assorted neighbors surrounding L.B. Jefferies's apartment building stands as one of director Alfred Hitchcock's finer touches in Rear Window. The set itself is simply breathtaking. An impressive feat of engineering and filmmaking, it was built entirely within the confines of a Paramount studio soundstage with several of the apartments themselves fully furnished. Georgine Darcy, for example, who plays the exquisitely sensual Miss Torso, used her apartment as if it were her real home, relaxing in between takes. Her character of course was the most blatant examples in this Rear Window of Hitchcock willfully taunting the Production Code, although there were plenty more besides this one background character. The director nonetheless enjoyed nearly every minute of it. In order to get around the complication of filming a leering depiction of Miss Torso, Hitchcock shot her scenes in three ways - one topless, one with her wearing white undergarments, and the other with her wearing black undergarments. Playing all three versions off the Production Code, he was able to keep intact all the scenes he intended for her by making it appear as though one version was less sexually suggestive then the other two.In addition to Miss Torso, there is one scene in particular in which Lisa proposes to Jeff that she be allowed to spend the night in his apartment is oozing with double entendres. While proving to him that she can live out a suitcase like he can she retorts, ""I'll bet yours isn't this small?"" And as she exposes the contents of her little suitcase, ""Compact, but, uh, ample enough"", pink lingerie is revealed. The daunting eloquence of Grace Kelly makes this scene all the more erotically charged.Two subplots which ultimately converge, to quote the insurance nurse Stella, like `two taxis on Broadway' and shift from agonizing heartbreak to emotional euphoria are those of the Composer and Miss Lonelyheart. Miss Lonelyheart's introduction is truly lamentable with her enacting a scene in which a gentlemen caller pays her a visit, complete with fine wine for toasting, while in the distance Jefferies raises a glass of wine toasting her as Lisa prepares an intimate dinner in the background. This of course is all perfectly ironic, demonstrating Jefferies's emotional distance from Lisa and his inability to commit to her, choosing instead to immerse himself in his `rear window' world as he has done for the past six weeks. Adding to the paradox, Bing Crosby's `To See You Is To Love You' plays in the distance as Miss Lonelyheart snaps back to reality, realizes she is alone, and buries her head in her arms and weeps.The next we see of both the Composer and Miss Lonelyheart, alcohol is heavily involved (the Composer staggers into his apartment drunk and Miss Lonelyheart takes several stiff drinks before leaving her apartment searching for male company). In yet another slight tinge of irony, Lisa starring out the window of the apartment listening to a tune on the wind says, ""Where does a man get inspiration to write a song like that?"" The Composer is playing the tune called `Mona Lisa' just as Miss Lonelyheart is sexually assaulted by a man who she proceeds to toss out of her apartment and then collapses on her couch weeping. The scene and tune itself can be interpreted two ways - for the Composer it is instantly identified with the famous painting by Leonardo Da Vinci (considered his muse) while for Miss Lonelyheart it is linked with the lyrics of the Nate King Cole song of the same name which references sexual assault.Her suicide attempt (complete with suicide note, Bible, and an overdose of sleeping pills) at the precise moment Jefferies is calling Thorwald's apartment to warn Lisa of his impending return make Jefferies next move (should he call the police in order to stop Miss Lonelyheart from killing herself or try and save the woman he supposedly loves by warning her of Lars Thornwald's return to the apartment) all the more intense. It culminates with Miss Not-So-Lonelyheart paying the Composer a visit whose song he has been composing all this time and what ultimately stopped her from taking her own life.Of course there is nothing humorous about a cute little dog having its neck broken but if one could find some amusement in this scene then it would have to be Lisa's line upon realizing that the dog was digging up something in Thornwald's garden, ""Maybe he knew too much"". This of course is a jab at Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Much (Stewart in interviews referred to the little pup as `The Dog Who Knew Too Much), a remake of which he was currently working on to start James Stewart.As Jefferies explains to Stella, his insurance nurse, he's not ready for marriage and that Lisa, his girlfriend, is too `Park Avenue' for his lifestyle, as he puts it a `camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank', he stares into an apartment where a newlywed couple has just moved. From this moment on until the end of the film, every time Jefferies looks toward their apartment window either the shades are closed or the husband in his underwear sticks his head outside to get a breath of fresh air only to be called back by his sexually unquenchable newlywed wife. The irony of this couple is that when the husband announces to his newlywed wife at the end of the film that he is quitting his job, the honeymoon is officially over, both literally and figuratively, leaving her to exclaim to him, ""But if you'd told me you quit your job, we wouldn't have gotten married"". In contrast to the relationship between Jefferies and Lisa, it leaves their future together rather open ended, especially if these two lovebirds are already having marital troubles.Whether or not Jefferies and Lisa wind up together and the rest of their neighbors find some sort of happiness is entirely irrelevant. Hitchcock believed (or so he said in interviews) that the characters and the story ended when the film ended. What is for certain however is the brilliance of this film. The performances are top-notch (easily the best in Grace Kelly's sadly short-lived film career and one of the best in James Stewart's lengthy career as an actor), the script is intricately woven with meaningful subplots and wrought with tension and excitement, and director Alfred Hitchcock is at the top of his game. You couldn't ask for anything more. Rear Window is without a doubt Alfred Hitchcock's best motion picture of his career, if not the best of the 1950s.",5,The Moose Hole - It Had to be Murder,1144713600,"04 11,

203724,A1FG91CM8221X1,6300183513,Miles D. Moore,"[3, 3]","""Rear Window,"" of course, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most glittering masterpieces, and the great thing about this DVD is that it goes a long way in showing us why. First, it presents the film in a beautiful new restoration, with glowing colors and crisp picture definition. Second, it provides a fascinating feature in the Extras section, describing how Hitchcock designed the set--one of the most ingenious production designs in cinematic history. It contains interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, including several of the neighbors on whom L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (James Stewart) trained his binoculars. The featurette fills us with renewed awe at Hitchcock, one of the most meticulous directors ever as well as one of the most brilliant, and at how he could keep such myriad, tiny details in his head as he made this film.And the film itself? I can only add my few droplets to the oceans of deserved praise it has received over the last half-century. What perfect casting: like a master chef, Hitchcock blends the disparate styles of Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr into something delicious and unique. What superbly timed suspense: if your pulse rate doesn't exceed 200 beats per minute as Stewart listens to Burr's footsteps up the stairs, growing closer and closer in a measured beat, you need to see your doctor immediately. And of course the first appearance of Kelly, a breathtaking blonde beauty arising as if from a dream, will haunt you forever. If you've never seen ""Rear Window,"" you won't regret buying this DVD sight unseen.

203729,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,6300183513,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 0]","'Rear Window' has long been revered not only as a classic Hitchcock film but a classic in its own right, so I was keen to watch it.  When I did so I was more than pleasantly surprised that something that is now quite old could be enjoyable as well as intelligent and just as relevant today (maybe even more so) than it was in its time.  The story by now is famous, with James Stewart playing Jeffries, a photographer who is wheelchair-bound in his appartment and begins spying on his neighbours to pass time.  Interesting as his neighbours may be, one man in particular catches his eye when his wife mysteriously disappears and Jeffries convinces himself that she has been murdered by her husband.Whilst on the surface this may appear to be a routine, but masterfully crafted thriller, it is actually a lot more than that, questioning the voyeurism inherent in everyone, our wish to see something new, exciting and shocking.  The camerawork creates an incredibly tense atmosphere, with everything shown from Jeffries' perspective from the window of his appartment.  As the camera pans slowly over the other flats we see tiny images of people boxed up in their windows, their private lives on display and us staring in at them; whether it be a couple arguing, a lonely woman or a sexy ballet dancer it's made very clear that it isn't just the character who's the voyeur but the audience as well.The movie also questions how we view our lives as reflections of other people's, such as when Jeffries reluctantly talks of committment to his girlfriend (Kelly) whilst looking on at a husband and wife shouting at one another.

203730,A1IOM171PPQ2U8,6300183513,"""mr_nasty""","[3, 4]","One of Hitchcock's best; he often made us feel as though we were spying on people in his films (like in &quot;Psycho,&quot; &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;) but this one was probably his most obvious attempt to cash in  on the natural craving of human beings to want to know other people's  business (&quot;get the dirt on them,&quot; so to speak).  Jimmy Stewart  plays L.B. Jeffries, a photographer who is laid up in his apartment with a  broken leg.  Out of boredom, he spends his days and nights staring out of  his apartment window into the rooms of other tenants across from him.  One  night, he hears some strange goings-on in the apartment directly across  from his; little by little, he begins to suspect that the man who lives  across from him (played by Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife.  Able to  withstand multiple viewings, unlike many murder mysteries, particularly  because of the standout performance of Thelma Ritter, as Stewart's  wisecracking comic-relief nurse Stella, who starts out disapproving of his  spying but later becomes just as curious as he does about what is  happening.  There's a touch of Hitch in Ritter's character - she  demonstrates perfectly the macabre sense of humor that Hitchcock tried to  inject a little bit of in all his films and in his TV show (her comments  about how she thinks Burr did it will keep you laughing throughout). Grace  Kelly is  very good as Stewart's girlfriend, who also gets in on the  voyeurism game and almost goes too far (in one of the most suspenseful  scenes in the picture - you'll be biting your nails the first time you see  it).  It's interesting how (in keeping with the theme of voyeurism) the  activities of all the apartment house tenants center on either sex or  death, the two great taboos which human beings naturally shy away from  discussing openly.  Definitely worth the price of the DVD - highly  recommended for purchase.",5,Come spy with me,956793600,"04 27, 2000",2000,1915,"['One', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'often', 'made', 'feel', 'were', 'spying', 'people', 'films', 'quot', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'quot', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'quot', 'one', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'cash', 'natural', 'craving', 'human', 'beings', 'want', 'know', 'other', 'people', 'business', 'quot', 'get', 'dirt', 'quot', 'so', 'speak', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'L.B', 'Jeffries', 'photographer', 'who', 'laid', 'up', 'apartment', 'broken', 'leg', 'boredom', 'days', 'nights', 'staring', 'apartment', 'window', 'rooms', 'other', 'tenants', 'One', 'night', 'strange', 'goings-on', 'apartment', 'directly', 'little', 'little', 'suspect', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'murdered', 'wife', 'Able', 'withstand', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'many', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'particularly', 'standout', 'performance', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'Stewart', 'wisecracking', 'comic-relief', 'nurse', 'Stella', 'who', 'out', 'disapproving', 'spying', 'later', 'becomes', 'just', 'as', 'curious', 'what', 'happening', 'touch', 'Hitch', 'Ritter', 'character', 'perfectly', 'macabre', 'sense', 'humor', 'Hitchcock', 'tried', 'inject', 'little', 'bit', 'films', 'TV', 'show', 'comments', 'how', 'Burr', 'did', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'very', 'good', 'Stewart', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'also', 'voyeurism', 'game', 'almost', 'too', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'picture', ""'ll"", 'be', 'biting', 'nails', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'interesting', 'how', 'keeping', 'theme', 'voyeurism', 'activities', 'apartment', 'house', 'tenants', 'center', 'sex', 'death', 'two', 'great', 'taboos', 'human', 'beings', 'naturally', 'shy', 'away', 'discussing', 'openly', 'Definitely', 'price', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'purchase']",Rear Window VHS

Too intrepid for his own good, Jefferies pays dearly for his mistake: confined to a wheelchair in a small apartment, he becomes a prisoner and takes pleasure in the multiple visions that unfold in front of him. He soon lives only through these images, a slave of adventures he wants to understand even as they elude his grasp; he periodically contemplates another kind of spectacle, that of Lisa courting him with the same energy he himself manifests as an amateur detective. He gradually identifies with his neighbours, and Hitchcock frequently equals his viewers with Jefferies, letting us see exactly what he sees. The film has a lot to say on the interpretative reading of works of art, as Jefferies tends to accept events only so far as they confirm his own hypotheses. It is when he seemingly elucidates the Thorwald mystery that he goes too far and commits his hubristic mistake for a second time; the film thus ends as it started, with Jefferies stuck in his wheelchair and Lisa reading a fashion magazine.

203752,A3TBM91S4SP0MS,6300183513,Paulo Andre,"[3, 3]","""Rear Window"" (alongside ""Psycho"") is universally regarded as Hitchcock's masterpiece and perhaps rightly so. There's something unique about this film which becomes harder to recreate as the years go by and we are hit left and right with silly special effects.So what is cinema but the opportunity it gives us to look into other people's lives? That is, by definition, in some way or another, true for most films. ""Rear Window"" takes that premise to the extreme. Well, if you live in the 50s, have just broken a leg and your place happens to have a big window through which you can spy on your entire neighborhood, there's not much else you can do, is there?At least that's what Jeffrey (again, magnificiently played by James Stewart) thinks, even more so when he becomes convinced that one of his neighbors (Raymond Burr, of ""Perry Mason"" fame) has killed the wife. The trick here is that Hitchcock places us right next to Jeffrey the whole time. We get no more information than he has and we are kept guessing all the way through.The plot only gets thicker as it goes along and fortunately for him Jeffrey can share his concerns with his girlfriend Lisa (played by the beautiful Grace Kelly) and his maid, who helps him with the house duties in his time of need. Obviously both of the women grow increasingly worried with the proceedings, with Lisa even managing to get herself in danger on a desperate attempt to solve the big mystery.I have trouble thinking of a genre that has more power to keep the viewer on the edge of his seat.

203753,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,6300183513,Paulo Leite,"[2, 2]","Why is Rear Window so important? FIRST, because it sums up all the elements that made Hitchcock a master among directors. It presents his vision of what Cinema was all about. It has a flawless screenplay with, director, stars and technicians at their peak form. SECOND, because Rear Window is one perfect example of the production triumphs the studio-system industrial line of work could generate . THIRD, because it is not just a classical work: it shows the evolution from the classical period in film history towards modern cinema. FOURTH, because it is one perfect example of mastering a technique.I will not bother with the story (which by now, I guess everybody already knows it - a man on a wheelchair watching his neighbors from his window... the crime... etc.) because the story is just one small aspect of what makes this film great. In fact, what it is important to point out is that this story (which is very simple) was translated into a screenplay structurally perfect. This perfection gives depth to the characters, amplifies relationships and oppositions (the stuff drama is made of) and makes the viewer an active part of the spectacle. The viewer works his way through the film and sees things we do not see very often on today's commercial cinema.Plus it is now on DVD. Restored. The image is beautiful and the sound is fine dolby mono 2.0 (although I was expecting a stereo soundtrack when I heard the DVD restoration was coming). The extras are fine (could be improved). Anyway, when the work is that great, who complains about small things?

Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly provide that classiness.  Cool and brazen Grace, subtlely provoking Jimmy at every turn, knowing he is stuck helpless with a broken leg in a cast, while she cavorts about getting too close to the murderer, and enjoying his nervousness.  The murderer is played by Ramond Burr in a strange role for him--but he is very scary.  In a stroke of genius, Hitchcock provides us a cutaway view of the appartments across the way and the dramas going on inside of them.  We start getting invested in the stories of the inhabitants.  Thelma Ritter adds something to the movie that it could not do without.  As Stewart's private duty nurse, her no-nonsence philosophies of life are very necessary for thorough scene development.

The film takes place exclusively in the photographer's apartment and we merely can see into the neighbor's apartments through their windows.  The photographer, Jeff Jeffries, is played by James Stewart and due his broken leg is confined to his apartment and due to the inherent voyeuristic nature of his trade, he trains his eye on the apartments across the courtyard.  Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend, Lisa, and she is at first disinterested and disapproving of his actions, but she too is soon drawn into the human drama.  Thelma Ritter plays her usual sarcastic role as a visiting nurse who is sucked into Jeff's human drama.  Mr. Hitchcock does a brilliant job of making Jeff's voyeurism at first seem comically, a fun way to kill idle time, then slowly building upon a suspicion that grows and grows until it reaches a scary and thrilling conclusion.  The fact that he only allows the audience to see things from the perspective of Jeff's apartment and never allows into the apartments across the courtyard is a brilliant piece of direction and adds to the tension.

There's something claustrophobic about what is essentially a movie set.  We are stuck in that lofty room with the big glass windows.  Jimmy Stewart peers across a courtyard and observes New Yorkers in their habitat.  When I was in elementary school we used to have projects called diorama's where we would take a shoebox and decorate it like a stage.  Each apartment in Hitch's diorama showcases a mostly silent vignette, the gorgeous dancer and her boyfriends, the lonely-heart middle-age lady, the sex crazed newlyweds, and the guy who kills his wife.Stewart can watch all the fun, but with a broken leg, he can't leave the apartment to do anything about it.  Hence, the suspense centers on Stewarts inability to maneuver when his girlfriend, fashion gal, Grace Kelly breaks into the killers apartment to find clues.  We see the killer coming down the hall and Jimmy can't warn her from his perch.Stewart and Kelly are interesting as a couple with opposite interests.

This is a movie that has so much going for it--mystery, suspense, humor, Hitchcock in the director's chair, and Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly in the lead roles.  Set entirely in an apartment with a view of the rest of the apartment complex, Rear Window revives the claustrophobic, one-setting feel of Lifeboat and Rope.  Some of my favorite performances from Stewart come from his work with Hitchcock, especially Vertigo and Rear Window.  Stewart shines here as photojournalist L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, and only Jimmy Stewart could make the viewer still care about him in spite of the crappy manner in which he treats his girlfriend Lisa, played by Kelly.  Grace Kelly was a lady who just reeked of elegance, charm and style.  Today's ""starlets"" have nothing on her.  As Jeffries is confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg, he spends much of his time at the window, watching his neighbors, and the viewer is drawn in and begins to care about the characters living in the apartment complex. Thelma Ritter gives us a great comic character as Jeffries' nurse, and Wendell Corey is also good as Doyle, Jeffries detective buddy.

203774,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6300183513,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 3]","Rear Window (Alfred Hitchcock, 1954)Few directors did it as well, and as consistently, as Alfred Hitchcock. And while I often wonder what it is the critics are thinking when they rank Hitchcock's films (Vertigo is better than North by Northwest? On what planet?), I have to admit that they've mostly got it right with Rear Window, which is a masterpiece of casting. It's a masterpiece of direction, too, but then it's a Hitchcock movie. You expect that.John Michael Hayes' adaptation of a story by the now mostly-obscure Cornell Woolrich (and his current obscurity is more of a crime than anything he ever wrote about) is brought to life by the casting of Jimmy Stewart as L. B. Jeffries, the film's main character. How much thought went into that choice? Actually, probably not much, given that in hindsight it makes such perfect sense. You're taking an actor who's well-known for being a good old-fashioned down-homey kind of guy and playing on that typecasting. You even give him a down-homey kind of hobby; he's bored, so he grabs his binoculars and starts spying on his neighbors. That's the kind of thing you expect eighty-year-old ladies to do. Where's the harm? I'm not sure any other actor could have brought that kind of baggage to the table but Jimmy Stewart. I mean, that's inspired casting, that is. And at heart, all the stupidity that follows is Jimmy Stewart trying to do the right thing. Doesn't he always?In fact, it's hard to think of Rear Window as noir, really. It's all just good, clean fun, with death and mayhem. (And really, how many of Jimmy Stewart's movies would have been spiced up by a little death and mayhem?) It's got a fun script, a fine leading actress in Grace Kelly (though honestly one wonders why someone as all-fired hot as Grace Kelly would waste her time on Jimmy Stewart when he's obviously trying to get rid of her), and some fabulous minor characters to inject much-needed humor to lighten things up now and again. There's none of the sense of bleakness that you get from a movie like Ace in the Hole or Sunset Blvd. here. And because of that, given the time in which it was made, it seems a bit out of place. I mean, even Douglas Sirk managed a pretty darned good piece of noir when he turned his mind to it (as did Hitch, actually; he practically invented the genre, where film was concerned, with his original version of The 39 Steps in 1935, and revitalized it briefly over a quarter century later with North by Northwest).Still, for all that, it is a fine piece of moviemaking, to be sure, and definitely stands up to repeated viewing; I think the time I'm basing this review on was my fifth. I like it a bunch. I still don't think it's North by Northwest or Psycho, or even Lifeboat (which I seem to like a whole lot more than most people), but it's one of Hitch's, say, top twenty movies. *** ",4,Can something be an overrated classic?,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,2845,"['Rear', 'Window', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1954', 'Few', 'directors', 'did', 'well', 'as', 'consistently', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'often', 'wonder', 'what', 'critics', 'are', 'thinking', 'when', 'rank', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'Vertigo', 'better', 'North', 'Northwest', 'what', 'planet', 'have', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'mostly', 'got', 'right', 'Rear', 'Window', 'masterpiece', 'casting', 'masterpiece', 'direction', 'too', 'then', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'expect', 'that.John', 'Michael', 'Hayes', 'adaptation', 'story', 'now', 'mostly-obscure', 'Cornell', 'Woolrich', 'current', 'obscurity', 'more', 'crime', 'anything', 'ever', 'wrote', 'brought', 'life', 'casting', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'L.', 'B.', 'Jeffries', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'How', 'much', 'thought', 'went', 'choice', 'Actually', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'given', 'hindsight', 'such', 'perfect', 'sense', ""'re"", 'taking', 'actor', 'who', 'well-known', 'being', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'down-homey', 'kind', 'guy', 'playing', 'typecasting', 'even', 'give', 'down-homey', 'kind', 'hobby', 'bored', 'grabs', 'binoculars', 'spying', 'neighbors', 'kind', 'thing', 'expect', 'eighty-year-old', 'ladies', 'do', 'Where', 'harm', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'kind', 'baggage', 'table', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'mean', 'inspired', 'casting', 'heart', 'stupidity', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', ""n't"", 'always', 'fact', 'hard', 'think', 'Rear', 'Window', 'noir', 'really', 'just', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'death', 'mayhem', 'really', 'how', 'many', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'spiced', 'up', 'little', 'death', 'mayhem', 'got', 'fun', 'script', 'fine', 'leading', 'actress', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'honestly', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'someone', 'all-fired', 'hot', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'would', 'waste', 'time', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'when', 'obviously', 'trying', 'get', 'rid', 'fabulous', 'minor', 'characters', 'inject', 'much-needed', 'humor', 'lighten', 'things', 'up', 'now', 'again', 'none', 'sense', 'bleakness', 'get', 'movie', 'Ace', 'Hole', 'Sunset', 'Blvd', 'here', 'given', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'bit', 'place', 'mean', 'even', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'managed', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good', 'piece', 'noir', 'when', 'turned', 'mind', 'did', 'Hitch', 'actually', 'practically', 'invented', 'genre', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'concerned', 'original', 'version', '39', 'Steps', '1935', 'revitalized', 'quarter', 'century', 'later', 'North', 'Northwest', '.Still', 'fine', 'piece', 'moviemaking', 'be', 'sure', 'definitely', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'think', 'time', ""'m"", 'basing', 'review', 'was', 'fifth', 'like', 'bunch', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'North', 'Northwest', 'Psycho', 'even', 'Lifeboat', 'seem', 'like', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'one', 'Hitch', 'say', 'top', 'twenty', 'movies', '***']",Rear Window VHS
203775,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6300183513,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","Hitchcock is becoming a treasured family evening activity in our house.  We have more than a dozen of his films in our collection, which draw us in for a forget-the-world experience of suspense and drama.  OK, the characters are not necessarily all that deep, but there is a engaging quality to the films that is a magic all its own.Because of the static setting of the film, this is one of the last ones we watched.  It starts slow, with a relationship that is fraught with tension:  Grace Kelly wants Jimmy Stewart, but he is holding back - because she is too perfect, he says, but also because he fears a basic incompatibility.  She is a fashion and social goddess, he a news mag photographer who is convalescing after an injury sustained by standing in the middle of a race track.  She wants him to stay in NYC and take up fashion photography, where they can go to the finest places, he doubts she would want to give up that world and travel to the jungles of Asia with him.  Kelly, who is absolutely stunning in her prime and reeks of NYC sophistication, is wooing him, the doubter, the pursued one.  With a hip cast, all he has to do is watch his neighbors, quite a roster of characters.THere is Raymond Burr in an unhappy marriage, lonely women, and a newlywed couple, who are active behind closed shades all the time (though the new husband shows signs of reluctance and fatigue.)  It is a wonderful social observation of a happening neighborhood, The Village.  Soon, he observes what he thinks is strange, and has trouble convincing Kelly, a detective pal, and his nurse that something is really going on.  However, with so many signs, Kelly begins to participate, in a way to prove to him that she is not what he thinks she is.  An adventure, largely just observed by Stewart from his room, ensues that builds to a frightening climax.  If ever you doubt that Hitchcock has a certain genius, you have to experience this.  There are also flashes of humor and sexual innuendo.There are also excellent critical reviews and documentaries of the restored version, which add to the excellence of this dvd.Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.

203776,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6300183513,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[0, 0]","""Rear Window"" comes very close to be the perfect Hitchcock film that illustrates nearly all his great abilities...Hitchcock demonstrates in ""Rear Window"" that he is a great voyeur, that he loves to spy on his characters making each viewer into a voyeur, forcing audience to see everything from his hero's point of view... James Stewart is hold up in his Manhattan two rooms apartment with a broken leg... He passes his time spying on his neighbors through back window in an orgy of voyeurism...Speaking of technical challenge, ""Rear Window"" is Hitchcock prototype... Most of the film is shot from one confined set... It is also notably theatrical since it takes place in one room...Hitchcock forces limitations on himself, as he did in ""Lifeboat"" when he shot entirely on a restricted set, in only one boat... And in ""Rope"" (his first Technicolor film) where the single setting for the production had only walls and furniture...Having restricted his movements, Hitchcock is demanded to be ingenious in order to keep curiosity alive... He builds a realistic courtyard of apartments with inhabitants in it, and the restriction becomes a potency and the technique a fascinating example of what he chooses to call ""pure cinema.""Hitchcock's camera tracks out through the windows... It never goes inside the apartments... We never see close-ups of the characters... We can only see what Stewart sees... We feel like we are watching people through a window instead of in a movie...Hitchcock doesn't use any kind of music... We hear natural sounds, occasional live music played in the surrounding apartment...""Rear Window"" describes Hitchcock at his best for the way it works on several levels, yet hides its own complexity... Stewart, tied in too by pressure from his high society girl who loves him and wants to marry him... Everything he sees out is related to this problem... He avoids to discuss marriage with her, though he himself does not seem to realize it...All the while, the people in the 31 apartments that he can see live out their little lives... The tormented middle-aged bachelor, composer/songwriter; the couple who beats the heat by sleeping on a fire escape; the newlyweds and lovers; the tragic ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" and her fantasies of entertaining gentlemen callers; the hearing-impaired sculptor working day and night; the vivacious and sexy blonde dancer ""Miss Torso"" who does suggestive routines in bikini tops and, most important, the hysterical ""nagging wife"" - lying in bed - and her grouchy fed-up husband, a jewelry salesman...One 'great shot' reveals just how involved Stewart has become in their lives when Miss Lovelyheart - in her romantic dinner for two - raises her glass in a toast to her imaginary lover and Stewart raises his glass as well...The urban backyard setting is the night city terrain of ""Rear Window,"" a night city shattered by the sharp sound of a loud female scream and the sound of breaking glass...Hitchcok presents Stewart who sees (or think he sees) what he is powerless to stop... The insidious salesman strangely attracts Stewart's attention... His Passtime becomes an obsession after he suspects that he has murdered his ailing wife and specially when he notices that she is missing... His ravishing fianc&eacute;e (Grace Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter) warn him that voyeurism is a crime and is dangerous... But Stewart persists, eventually he was turned on ... This explain perfectly his specific use of a huge zoom lens to do his peeping as he monitors the murderer's activities... The murderer and his wife became subject of Stewart's parody with the ""too perfect, too talented, too sophisticated,"" Grace Kelly...""Rear Window"" is visually very strong... Hitchcock designs the film in such a way so that his view is our view... He manipulates our emotions because he knows perfectly his work... He has the film synchronized in his mind... Shooting and editing are, for him, a simple mechanical phase... The creativity has all taken place before...The first shot of ""Rear Window"" is a perfect example of this reality - as his many typical first shots - for the way it visually transmits the whole complex to the audience...Hitchcock is a master at using his camera to create suspense... Like Stewart, we are restricted in movements, paralyzed inside the apartment, immobile, trapped in a room where we are anxious and uncertain... There is no way we can warn the outcome... This is what 'suspense' is all about--not surprise... An effect of intense and prolonged expectancy, lacking all help in the state of knowing that we possess but the characters do not... And, of course, all this great suspense is created by only 'visual' means...Stewart gives the performance of his life behaving at ease... He was the perfect Hitchcock character: a voyeur by profession, an unpretentious photo journalist who becomes caught in a terrifying event...When you see the film, feel the menacing 'look' of the murderer staring those evil eyes at you... And don't forget to catch Alfred Hitchcok in his customary cameo appearance, this time repairing a clock...

He becomes very interested in the married couple when one day the invalid wife disappears and the husband begins acting strangely. The photographer includes his girlfriend (Grace Kelly), his nurse (Thelma Ritter), and a detective friend in his theory that the man murdered his wife.When one thinks of Hitchcock, thoughts of crimes and plot twists come to mind. This film seems to be much more straightforward. It moves very slowly and none of the big events in the film seem all that major to the audience because most of them happen outside Stewart's apartment building.

203785,A6FIAB28IS79,6300183513,Samuel Chell,"[0, 0]","Although Hitchcock listed this as one of his 2 favorite films, I had once viewed it as &quot;closet drama&quot; because of the limited set, conventional bad guy, passive good guy.  The voyeuristic angle was interesting, even provocative to a point, but insufficient to save the movie from its sense of claustrophobic one-dimensionality.That was before I viewed the film through the eyes of Grace Kelly.  In one respect, the critical, pivotal moment in the movie is not when Kelly puts herself at risk in Raymond Burr's apartment, nor is it the film's climax with James Stewart fending off the murderer with his camera's flash bulbs.  Rather, it's the moment when Hitchcock's camera (not Stewart's) shows Kelly's eyes suddenly open wide and come alive when she, too, becomes interested in the scenes being played out on the other side of the court yard.At this point, within the first half of the film, Kelley drops her high society, fashion-model airs and her constant mothering of Stewart.  She now spectates with greater curiosity and imagination than Stewart, and even though she questions these &quot;rear window ethics&quot; and characterizes her behavior as &quot;ghoulish,&quot; it's clear she has become a major player, fully participating in the game of voyeurism, scopophilia, and fetishism that is normally assigned only to men who fail to emerge from an obsessively narcissistic and hedonistic childhood.For the past 20 years feminist academics have been applying &quot;male gaze theory&quot; to just about every film in sight, and invariably to the discredit of the male.  He is the subject; she's the object; he's the one who sees; she's the one who is seen; he owns the gaze in all of his power, pleasure, and guilt; she can only helplessly follow the gaze, experiencing a kind of masochistic pleasure at best.In &quot;Rear Window&quot; Hitchcock, frequently depicted by feminist critics as a mother-obsessed misogynist, turns gaze theory on its head.  Grace Kelly demonstrates that a woman can get as much pleasure from looking as do men--an irony of collossal proportions when we consider that as a high fashion model her role, if not job, is to be looked at and photographed.But Hitchcock's film manages to liberate its central heroine's vision while preserving the &quot;institutions&quot; of marriage, motherhood, and femininity.  What is the object of Kelly's pursuit while playing the game at its most intense moment?  A wedding ring, which she flashes before the probing telescopic lens of Stewart.  And at the end of the film, the camera makes clear that, pending his recovery from double castration (both legs are now broken), he will no longer go off on adventures without Kelly at his side.

203787,A1K94LXX833JTT,6300183513,Sanpete,"[21, 22]","Rear Window is considered by many Alfred Hitchcock's best movie.  The story suited him well.  A man confined to a wheelchair, watching things that may be innocent or murderous, a beautiful woman out of her element, in danger, with gradually building suspense that takes a potentially fatal turn as we watch helplessly with our immobilized protagonist, and a cliffhanger climax.  The movie has been analyzed by very smart people looking for much more than that, deeper meanings and allusions, and some of their ideas are true, and some are fun.  But it's the basic story elements, sharp dialogue, fine acting and the direction of a master that make it a great movie.The immobilized man is ""Jeff"" Jeffries (James Stewart), a Life Magazine photographer who's laid up in his New York City apartment with a broken leg.  Accustomed to an active life of adventure and world traveling, he's reduced to passing his time using binoculars and a telephoto lens to spy on the small world of neighbors across a small courtyard from his rear window.  The beautiful woman is his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), a high society woman whom he is avoiding marrying on the excuse that she isn't cut out for his rambling life of action and danger, and he doesn't want to settle down.  As events across the way take a potentially sinister turn, the tables are turned as Lisa shows her grit in risky investigations while Jeff must remain passive.  Raymond Burr (of Perry Mason fame) plays the suspect neighbor who may or may not have killed someone.  Thelma Ritter is Jeff's house-call nurse who also gets involved.Most of the film is presented from Jeff's powerless perspective, giving the suspense an extra edge.  There are allusions to impotence and, through the lives of the neighbors, a range of romantic and marriage relationships mirroring the fears of many men and women, including our protagonists.  Much has been made of the theme of voyeurism, the window as a representation of the movie screen and so on, though I think it's easy to make too much of that.  Screenwriter John Michael Hayes and Hitchcock work in the usual Hitchcock cameo and humor, including a dog who ""knew too much"" (a reference to another Hitchcock film).The new 2-disc Special Edition DVD looks to be an excellent set.  It will include new special features:-- audio commentary by John Fawell, author of Hitchcock's Rear Window: The Well-Made Film-- Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master-- Hitchcock/Truffaut interview excerpts-- Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock-- Alfred Hitchcock Presents Mr. Blanchard's Secret-- original theatrical trailerThere will also be features carried over from the 2001 Collector's Edition:-- Rear Window Ethics: An Original Documentary (55 minutes)-- A Conversation with Screenwriter John Michael Hayes (13 minutes on the Collector's Edition)-- 1983 re-release trailer for Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Trouble With Harry, Rope, and Rear Window, narrated by James Stewart (6 minutes)-- production photographs-- production notesThere's no mention in the press release of the screenplay feature that was on the older DVD.  It allowed you, using a DVD-ROM drive, to read the script while watching the movie, or to print out the script.

If it's your first time watching Hitchcock, this might be a good place to start. The story centers around photographer L.B. Jefferies (played by Jimmy Steweart), who is confined to his apartment because of his broken leg. He is visited regularly by his nurse Stella (played by Thelma Ritter) and his socialite girlfriend Lisa (played by the luminous Grace Kelly). As for that, he really has nothing more to pass the time with. So he begins to spy on his neighbors. From this, several miny story-lines enfold but the most interesting by far is that of a man who appears to have murdered his wife. As the evidence becomes more clear, the suspense mounts and leads to a gripping conclusion that is much better than any in a modern day horror movie. A movie like 'Rear Window' is so interesting to watch because there is so much for us to watch. There's Jeff's story line, the possibility of a murder and all of the other things going on around him that gives the viewer something interesting and new. In a way, 'Rear Window' is like an homage to movies themselves. What is Jefferies doing? He's a voyeur. What are we when we watch movies? Getting the idea? Maybe that's what makes this movie so interesting to watch. As Stella quoted, we've become a race of peeping toms.

I am no film critic, but I do know when a movie is good or not after I see it. In such a small neighborhood setting all throughout the film, Mr. Hitchcock is able to generate considerable viewer-interest and suspense as he affords us a window-sized view into the lives of the tenants living in the surrounding apartments. We see these through the eyes of our hero, who for the moment is tied to the wheelchair with one leg in full brace. It is through the idle hours of doing nothing where he begins to look out of the window and observe (spy is a more fitting word) more closely the lives of his neighbors. The dilemma starts when he begins to suspect one of them as having committed murder.Let's face it, to some degree, every human being has a taste for voyeurism (although, the nature of voyeurism in this film is not largely sexual : only one scene where our protagonist sees, through a small window which only exposed the head, the young woman living across his apartment taking a shower.) The movie knows this, and aptly capitalizes on this knowledge. James Stewart stars, and Grace Kelly, as the leading lady, has never been more beautiful and captivating.

This is not your usual Alfred Hitchcock thriller; it would be 5-10 years later that his movies took on a darker and more aggressive approach.

Most of the neighbours we hardly meet close up, but they all have their own personalities and lives, and we only really see them through the eyes of the wheelbound voyeur.James Stewart and Grace Kelley are the headline stars here, Stewart the wheelbound photographer and Kelley his glamourous girlfriend, but I couldn't help feeling they were mismatched and things didn't exactly gel between them, either on screen (at least to my eyes) or as characters.  Also it was a little ponderous at times in getting to the point, and I felt my attention wandering on occasions while watching it.

REAR WINDOW ends without an end credit; which is quite normal at that time.The ending credits you see on this version is the the restoration credits. They did a tremendous job and I guess they deserve a credit, or to take the responsibility about it.It is not quite fair to compare the result of this restoration with that of VERTIGO; while VERTIGO was shot in VistaVision, which allows practically the same exposed film area per frame as a 70 mm film, REAR WINDOW is a straight 35mm (shot in 1:37 academic ratio, but here presented as wide screen, which may raise a controversy), so the resolution of the film itself is much less than in a VistaVison film.And the restoration of VERTIGO had a grave flaw; for the sake of making  a DTS stereo soundtrack (while the original release was in mono), they threw away all the original sound effects and replacing them with new folley works (adding sound effects on a sound stage), which in my opinion, sounds quite awful and disturbing. At least for the sound, REAR WINDOW is a much more faithful job.Also, the color is treated with the Technicolor dye transfer process, basically the same color system as the original release, which allows deeper, more saturated color, which is even apparent on this DVD edition. Remember the climatic scenes in VERTIGO? While that scene was printed as dark as Hitchcock originally intended, the Eastman color positive does not allow to have as much range of contrast as dye trasnfer does, so the faces of James Stewart and Kim Novak should have been a bit more visible (or at least it was when I saw an old dye-transfer print). You don't have that problem with this new REAR WINDOW.The famous kiss scene effect is the only portion of this restored version that was restored digitaly (as far as I know). The original film elements has completely faded (optically-processed film elements tend to fade easily), but Cinesite has done a beautiful job. That scene looks almost mystical in this verison.

His only visitors are his girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly)and his unsympathetic, wisecracking nurse Stella played by wonderful Thelma Ritter. With nothing to do and limited visitors Jeffries spends his time looking out of his apartment rear window and into the windows of his neighbors. As he looks, he finds himself drawn into their lives. The woman who nags her traveling salesman husband, the newlyweds who keep their window shade down at all times except when they occasionally come up for air; the beautiful young ballet dancer who practices everyday, the unsuccessful composer, the older couple with the little dog who does nothing but bark and middle-aged woman Jeffries has dubbed ""Miss Lonelyhearts."" Miss Lonelyhearts lives alone but sets her dinner table for two and holds conversations with her make imaginary lover.When Jeffries relates the daily goings on to his girlfriend Lisa, she chastises him for being a voyeur and invading his neighbors privacy. Jeffries nurse Stella notes that ""We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change."" Nevertheless Jeffries continues watch. He now uses his binoculars and his always by his side camera. Then he notices that the salesman's nagging wife is not only quiet but absent from the scene. What happened to her? Jeffries watches the salesman as he appears to cautiously leave his apartment in the middle of the night. Why is he sneaking out of his own home? Why is the salesman cleaning knives and a saw, what where they used for? What was in the trunk that he had shipped? Jeffries is convinced that the salesman has killed his wife. He sets out to prove it. He enlists the help of a friend, Thomas Doyle (Wendall Corey) who is a lieutenant in the police department. Jeffries also believes that the salesman, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) has killed his neighbors small dog because the dog was digging in the garden for something that the salesman had buried. He wants Doyle to investigate even there is no evidence that this is true.As with all Alfred Hitchcock movies, you can always find humor just below the surface. In REAR WINDOW Jeffries says, ""He killed a dog last night because the dog was scratching around in the garden. You know why? Because he had something buried in that garden that the dog scented."" Doyles response is ""Like an old hambone?"" Jefferies says ""I don't know what pet names Thorwald had for his wife.""When Jeffries can't get help from Doyle he persuades Lisa and Stella to help him get some answers.

All of that said, ""Rear Window"" still stands tall as a film classic because of the themes, artistry of Hitchcock, the performances and the witty dialogue that we hear in the film. Unseen except for rare TV performances in the early 60's and rare revival house showings, ""Rear Window"" looks extremely good in its DVD presentation although clearly no complete restoration was done here like was done for ""Vertigo"" (but ""Rear Window"" wasn't in as bad a shape as ""Vertigo"" either). This edition looks better than the previous DVD (although it should be noted it's the same transfer as what was in the Hitchcock boxed set release four years ago)with a nice anamorphic transfer. Some people seem to think that film grain is a bad thing--it's not it's just how the film looks and ""Rear Window"" is no exception. Expecting this to look like a film produced in 2008 isn't realistic and it won't--but it still looks darn good.Extras are as follows: The extras that came with the boxed set as well as those from the previous single DVD release have been ported over to this release as well. We get two new delicious extras--a theme appropriate episode of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" with the Hitchcock directed episode """"Mr. Blanchard's Secret"" and also excerpts from the interview Traffaut did with Hitchcock for his book in the early 60's.Other extras: Audio commentary by author John Falwell, ""Rear Window Ethics"", Interview with Writer John Michael Hayes"", ""Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master"", ""Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock"", production notes, theatrical trailers, photo gallery, audio interview excerpts from Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock,A plot synopsis is below for those intereested:Spying through a glass darkly (his camera lens), L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) believes a neighbor (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. His evidence is circumstanial at best and the wheelchair bound photographer has to convince his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly)of the crime. In the process he puts his friends in harm's way. Hitch laces his film with more than a touch of humor and irony pulling this thriller together as it's L.B.'s peeping that reveals the ugly underneath--revealing something unsavory about himself as well without him truly realizing it.Hitchcock manages to do more with less than just about any director out there. Using a single soundstage, a small cast and the witty script by John Michael Hayes, Hitchcock crafts one of his classic films. ""Rear Window"" has aged yes but it looks, sounds and plays remarkably well fifty four years after it's original theatrical release.

The latter film relates to Jimmy Stewart playing a retired detective determined to make another woman into someone he believed had previously existed but never did, and was only a fictitious creation of her lover, who was a clever murderer.  Kim Novak, in one of her early efforts, played the dual role with just the proper measure of ethereal distance.Four years before &quot;Vertigo&quot; previewed Hitchcock directed another powerful voyeuristic film with Stewart cast in the male lead, this time opposite another blonde bombshell, the future princess Grace Kelly.  Based on a story by master thriller author Cornell Woolrich, &quot;Rear Window&quot; is about a successful photographer who, after breaking his leg in an accident while covering an automobile race, is laid up in his Manhattan apartment.  In between visits from gorgeous socialite Kelly he whiles away his time observing his neighbors from the apartment building behind his own, separated by a courtyard.Stewart lives as a voyeur, spending his time observing people like Miss Lonelyhearts, the woman who fixes herself candlelight dinners she shares with wine and music with imaginary love interests, a composer constantly at work at his piano, and a seductively constructed ballet dancer with a seemingly unending host of male admirers.  Kelly becomes concerned over his interest in observing the ballet dancer.Eventually Stewart becomes preoccupied, however, with another neighbor, the husky, white-haired Raymond Burr, several years away from his future starring role in the Perry Mason television detective series.  Stewart notices that Burr's wife is ill and confined to bed.  He then becomes increasingly preoccupied with Burr's comings and goings at various hours of the night.  At first Kelly tells him he is concerned over nothing.  He then attracts her interest, and finally that of his detective friend and former World War Two Air Force buddy Wendell Corey.Just what is happening?  Are their imaginations overworked?  The finale is spelled out in typical Hitchcock fashion, after he has worked his audience's curiosity to overpowering levels.  Hitchcock seemingly loved little, if anything, more than tweaking his audience.  The curiosity grows and grows until the finale.The color and camera work are spectacular.  We stare into the lives of individuals who are unaware of the fact that we are there.  That is, until Raymond Burr begins to suspect something.  At that point the story moves into high gear, all the way to its compelling climax.",5,A Voyeuristic Masterpiece,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,2659,"['quot', 'Rear', 'Window', 'quot', 'quot', 'Vertigo', 'quot', 'have', 'been', 'referred', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'voyeuristic', 'masterpieces', 'good', 'reason', 'latter', 'film', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'playing', 'retired', 'detective', 'determined', 'make', 'woman', 'someone', 'believed', 'had', 'previously', 'existed', 'never', 'did', 'was', 'only', 'fictitious', 'creation', 'lover', 'who', 'was', 'clever', 'murderer', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'one', 'early', 'efforts', 'played', 'dual', 'role', 'just', 'proper', 'measure', 'ethereal', 'distance.Four', 'years', 'quot', 'Vertigo', 'quot', 'previewed', 'Hitchcock', 'directed', 'powerful', 'voyeuristic', 'film', 'Stewart', 'cast', 'male', 'lead', 'time', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'future', 'princess', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Based', 'story', 'master', 'thriller', 'author', 'Cornell', 'Woolrich', 'quot', 'Rear', 'Window', 'quot', 'successful', 'photographer', 'who', 'breaking', 'leg', 'accident', 'covering', 'automobile', 'race', 'laid', 'up', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'visits', 'gorgeous', 'socialite', 'Kelly', 'away', 'time', 'observing', 'neighbors', 'apartment', 'building', 'own', 'separated', 'courtyard.Stewart', 'voyeur', 'spending', 'time', 'observing', 'people', 'Miss', 'Lonelyhearts', 'woman', 'who', 'fixes', 'candlelight', 'dinners', 'shares', 'wine', 'music', 'imaginary', 'love', 'interests', 'composer', 'constantly', 'work', 'piano', 'seductively', 'constructed', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'seemingly', 'unending', 'host', 'male', 'admirers', 'Kelly', 'concerned', 'interest', 'observing', 'ballet', 'dancer.Eventually', 'Stewart', 'preoccupied', 'however', 'neighbor', 'husky', 'white-haired', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'several', 'years', 'away', 'future', 'starring', 'role', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'television', 'detective', 'series', 'Stewart', 'Burr', 'wife', 'ill', 'confined', 'bed', 'then', 'increasingly', 'preoccupied', 'Burr', 'comings', 'goings', 'various', 'hours', 'night', 'first', 'Kelly', 'concerned', 'nothing', 'then', 'interest', 'finally', 'detective', 'friend', 'former', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'Air', 'Force', 'buddy', 'Wendell', 'Corey.Just', 'what', 'happening', 'Are', 'imaginations', 'overworked', 'finale', 'spelled', 'out', 'typical', 'Hitchcock', 'fashion', 'worked', 'audience', 'curiosity', 'overpowering', 'levels', 'Hitchcock', 'seemingly', 'loved', 'little', 'anything', 'more', 'tweaking', 'audience', 'curiosity', 'grows', 'grows', 'finale.The', 'color', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'spectacular', 'stare', 'lives', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'unaware', 'fact', 'are', 'there', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'suspect', 'something', 'point', 'story', 'high', 'gear', 'way', 'compelling', 'climax']",Rear Window VHS

The movie's coloring was so brash as to suggest colorization in many places, even though I withold that charge.

Even Ms. (sorry, Miss) Torso in the window across the street, she was built like a futbolista, like a powerful woman in command of her body. She was - she was a dancer, but that was back when dancers were superb athletes first, not a DSM IV category.Grace Kelly did a lot to illustrate the vision of 'glamor' of the 1950s. She may also have done a fair bit to demonstrate how a proper lady may express her serious intent to a gentleman, inviting herself for an overnight visit, showing her preparatations, and dang the nosy visitors. Maybe back then it was risque (or worse). Today it would scarcely raise an eyebrow, more likely a smile wishing the best to both.

203821,AP3B615GM191G,6300183513,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","By today's standards, a film like ""Rear Window"" would seem quite uninspired, unoriginal, and just plain derivative (see: Disturbia).  However, when one considers that Hitchcock's ""Window"" actually SET the standard, it really can be considered a groundbreaking film.For a basic plot summary, ""Rear Window"" sees photographer L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) laid up with a broken leg, with nothing else to do but stare out the window at the activities of his city-dwelling neighbors.  One neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) in particular, though, arouses the interest of Jeffries due to his strange behavior and disappearing wife.  At first, things seem relatively harmless, until Jeffries' girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) gets pulled into the proceedings, making things a whole lot more personal.Once again, this movie shows just how far ahead of the game Alfred Hitchcock was compared to other directors of his time.  In 1954, while other directors were cranking out B-pictures, character flicks, or even ""variety show"" events that did nothing more than draw crowds, Hitch was crafting a spooky tale of voyeurism that still holds up very well to this day.  The directing is fantastic, as Hitch slowly builds the tension to a few scenes towards the end that will make your blood run cold.The acting is also top-notch.  You can't go wrong with Jimmy Stewart, and Grace Kelly shows that she isn't just a ""pretty face"" as well.  Raymond Burr (though only uttering a few lines of dialogue) is also intriguing as the antagonist throughout.About the only criticism I have of this film (what drops it from a 5-star to 4-star rating) is that Hitch puts in some character development just for the sake of character development...it doesn't really lead anywhere.  A full 20 minutes could have been cut out in relation to character-building, and the overall product might have been more exciting/better paced.Overall, though, this is a great movie that truly stands the test of time.  Whatever you do, don't go for the ""remake"" Disturbia.

My favorite aspect about this movie is the juxtapostioning of Stewart learning about his neighbors as he watches them with him seeing new aspects of his girlfriend's adventurous spirit that he didn't know existed.",5,Rear Window,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,474,"['James', 'Stewart', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'make', 'wonderful', 'couple', 'film', 'mystery', 'guessing', 'end', 'focus', 'out', 'rear', 'window', 'Stewart', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'apartment', 'relationship', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'socialite', 'progresses', 'changes', 'favorite', 'aspect', 'movie', 'juxtapostioning', 'Stewart', 'learning', 'neighbors', 'seeing', 'new', 'aspects', 'girlfriend', 'adventurous', 'spirit', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'existed']",Rear Window VHS

I remember staying in hotels in Manhattan before taking a ship or a plane to Europe. From my hotel window I could see naked people in other hotels or apartments. Some of them were probably exhibitionists, but others were living in rooms that had no air conditioning and were just trying to avoid the heat.This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies: James Stewart and Grace Kelley were terrific.",5,There Is Never A Dull Moment in Rear Window,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,466,"['have', 'voyeur', 'exhibitionist', 'tendencies', 'film', 'exciting', 'remember', 'staying', 'hotels', 'Manhattan', 'taking', 'ship', 'plane', 'Europe', 'hotel', 'window', 'could', 'see', 'naked', 'people', 'other', 'hotels', 'apartments', 'were', 'probably', 'exhibitionists', 'others', 'were', 'living', 'rooms', 'had', 'air', 'conditioning', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'avoid', 'heat.This', 'one', 'favorite', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Grace', 'Kelley', 'were', 'terrific']",Rear Window VHS
203824,A25JBPU5G0C29H,6300183513,Zev Bazarov,"[3, 4]","This 1954 film was directed by the great master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock and stars James Stewart as Jeff, and Grace Kelly as Lisa. Jeff is a photojournalist with a broken leg after an accident on one of his previous news assignment. He is bound to his wheelchair in his small apartment over looking a wide variety of people with different stories, and situations. He's bored so he observes them, but when one of them shows suspicious behavior, he believes there has been a murder. He becomes obsessed and watches day and night, even getting his friends involved. Since they have no evidence, they must investigate themselves.This is another masterpiece from Hitchcock, with many layers, and stories going on. The direction is great, and the film ends very suspenseful. The acting is perfect by both leads. The film is great as entertainment, but also you can have a variety of interpretations of what Hitchcock really meant with this film. This is a classic and should be in every film lovers DVD collection. Highly recommended. 5 stars.",5,Classic mystery/suspense film,1037404800,"11 16, 2002",2002,1041,"['1954', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'great', 'master', 'suspense', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'stars', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Jeff', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Lisa', 'Jeff', 'photojournalist', 'broken', 'leg', 'accident', 'one', 'previous', 'news', 'assignment', 'bound', 'wheelchair', 'small', 'apartment', 'looking', 'wide', 'variety', 'people', 'different', 'stories', 'situations', 'bored', 'so', 'when', 'one', 'suspicious', 'behavior', 'been', 'murder', 'obsessed', 'watches', 'day', 'night', 'even', 'getting', 'friends', 'involved', 'have', 'evidence', 'must', 'investigate', 'themselves.This', 'masterpiece', 'Hitchcock', 'many', 'layers', 'stories', 'going', 'direction', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'acting', 'perfect', 'leads', 'film', 'great', 'entertainment', 'also', 'can', 'have', 'variety', 'interpretations', 'what', 'Hitchcock', 'really', 'meant', 'film', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'lovers', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Highly', 'recommended', '5', 'stars']",Rear Window VHS
