Like the other reviewer wrote, I too kept my eyes closed most of the time. The music is soothing and the instruction is simple enough for me to follow. I liked this the first time I tried it. At first I had a 48 hour rental, but when the rental expired I found myself wanting to practice this again so I bought it. That first night after having bought it I was exhausted but forced myself to practice (since of course I just bought it). As soon as I began practicing that evening I began to feel relieved.

1060911,A1H73NW4DTNR1O,B000NVKZW4,Amazon Woman,"[1, 10]","I wanted to like this DVD and there is a lot of stuff on here to like.  However, it was at the point where she had us holding out one hand with certain fingers touching and chanting ""har"" and promising this would ""cleanse my kidneys"" that I realized much of Kundalini yoga, like its creator, Yogi Bhajan, is just plain BS.  If you research enough on Yogi Bhajan you'll find incriminating, damning information that he was simply an imposter, a charlatan, who made up much of the practice on the spot during his classes.Sorry, but holding one arm out and chanting ain't gonna cleanse anyone's kidneys.  That's just magical thinking, which is what most of ""Kundalini"" yoga is.  Exercises made up on the spot by a fake guru that have somehow become part of the yoga practice unfortunately.  There are indeed yoga poses that would help the internal organs but those are legit poses like twists.If you doubt this review, watch the documentary ""Kumare"" and see how some gullible people in Phoenix adopt some silly movements from a fake guru thinking it's some sort of thousand of years old practice that he too made up on the spot.  My favorite is a sort of warrior pose but with a swinging arm that looks like ""air guitar"".  Seriously, watch Kumare, the doc and then try to watch this Maya Fiennes video with promises of kidney cleansing to realize just how ridiculous and gullible we humans are to engage in some unproven yoga poses, created in the 1970's by a fake guru with no credentials (search the web to confirm this) that are supposed to heal this and that without directly engaging those organs in some sort of actual pose.Kundalini also has a lot of hyperventilation which I'm not sure really affords benefit and weirdly enough, so much of it is spent SITTING.

I find the sets energising and also fun and there are some short periods of meditation/rest inbetween which I like. The class ends with a relaxation in savasana (lying down 'corpse pose') and then a tune out to end. Maya gives good instruction and encouragement throughout the class. Following the class I feel energised yet calm at the same time, this follows into the day (I do morning practice).I work within my own limits on any given day and each day is different for me as to what I can achieve.I had been practicing Hatha yoga for approx one year prior to discovering Kundalini yoga. My main practice is now Kundalini Yoga.Update..18th May 2010This DVD Kundalini Yoga class was my first introduction to this type of yoga and I am so glad that I made the purchase as over a year later it is still a firm favourite in my rotation of DVD classes which include all of Maya's classes (Journey through the chakra's), Ana and Ravi's, Gurumkh, Gurutej, Erin Kamler and Carolyn Cowan.

If you are used to going to a studio you may notice that Maya does not cover her head and that she does not end with ""Long Time Sun"" these are small details.  The exercises themselves you would find at any Kundalini class.It doesn't seem at first like it's that much of a workout.  I had been doing regular Hatha yoga for about a year and a half before I stumbled on Kundalini.  This entire workout is sitting or lying down! You can do it in a small apartment.  You can do it on your rug with out any props, not even a mat.  Which is cool.  After 40 days in a row of doing this, I must say it WAS a work out, because I was powering through the Hatha yoga classes with strength I didn't know I had.After finding this video I bought Gurmukh's video and also some by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh.  Gurmukh's was really hard for me, I still struggle to finish it.  Ana Brett and Ravi Singh have a convenient option on their dvd's called ""matrix"" so you can sequence your own workout length.  Because of that feature I started using their dvd's more often than this one.  I would still highly recommend this video - and encourage you to try doing it for 40 days in a row!

The DVD completes with Sat Nam.Also included on the DVD is a foreword by Deepak Chopra and Maya Fiennes Biography.Maya shares with you the benefits of each exercise.

The music used on this DVD is better than average and I think it was created by Maya herself.

This really is a destressing workout and your spine will feel amazing afterward. Yes, Maya talks about the Aquarian Age coming in 2012. It's fairly benign and only in the first chapter which is about 2 minutes of her talking.Maya is a great instructor, warning you when something might make beginners dizzy and encouraging you to break through if you are getting tired (one move near the end definitely was more challenging than it looked.) I find her very soothing. I also like little things like when she says to stretch if you need to, she stops and stretches herself. The corpse pose at the end is actually several minutes of corpse pose too, not just a ""Stay in savasana as long as you need to"" followed by the DVD chapter abruptly ending and loud credits music coming on. These small but thoughtful touches make me feel like Maya really is doing the workout with me.And full disclosure--maybe it's just the oxygenation, but one exercise makes me laugh. It just makes me ridiculously happy. I love this DVD. Try it-the exercises work even if you don't get into the patter.

I already have this yoga set on another dvd which is more complete than Maya Fiennes'  The only thing I do like about her dvd is the music.  The other reviewer said that the chants were African. No they are gurmukhi mantra chants. The music is tribal. That said here is what you can expect.Setting:  Totally white.  Teacher is dressed in white on a sheepskin rug.Music: tribal with vocals.  I really liked the musicInstruction: In voice over. She tells you a lot about kundalini yoga during the poses.Kriya:  This is the set for the adrenals.  It consists of hands in lotus and moving them out to the side; wrist press; body drops, active cat/cow; pelvis lifts holding ankles and a couple of other poses.The class ends with deep relaxation.What I didn't like:  No meditation at the end of the class.  I think teachers do a dis-service to students when they only teach the physical part of kundalini yoga. I'm a traditionalist in that respect; to me kundalini yoga is much much more than stretching. Without the meditation, you might as well do pilates! There are 1000's of meditations to choose from and she couldn't include one of them on this dvd.  That is what I love about Ravi Singh's dvds, he includes meditations on EVERY SINGLE DVD he puts out.If you are interested in this set on dvd.  Get the dvd by Sat Jivan Singh Khalsa at the spiritvoyage website.  It includes 4 meditations and a delightful GONG relaxation. You haven't lived until you've relaxed to the sound of the GONG.I rented this dvd from netflix and after previewing it I sent it right back.Overall:  If you are new to kundalini yoga, you may like this.
