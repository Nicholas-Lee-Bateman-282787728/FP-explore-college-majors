Any smart person with half of a brain would just move out of that apartment from that noise and wacky neighbor. Also most girls in real life wouldn't go home with some random weird looking guy she meets in a seedy bar after giving bad ""come on"" lines and have sex with him at his place! The bar scene doesn't really work in modern times. But then she was drunk and traumatized after seeing her wacky neighbor half dead in a pool of blood. After all that, what her wacky neighbor really wanted was to make the main female character her personal assisstant at her company. Later on she becomes like her wacky neighbor after killing her.

So I started watching it and couldnt get myself to change the channel. This was a indepentdeant low budget movie , of mostly dialog. But i held my attention. This suspense movie had me watching to see what would happen next. THe main plot of the movie is a young lady moves into a apartment and her neighbor just keep making to much noise with her sex and music and what not. This noise just keep build up and up and ruins the young ladys life. The ending is very surprising. It wouldnt hurt to watch this movie.",3,Its was good,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,591,"['accidently', 'saw', 'movie', 'tv', 'early', 'morning', 'being', 'very', 'bored', 'started', 'watching', 'couldnt', 'get', 'change', 'channel', 'was', 'indepentdeant', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'mostly', 'dialog', 'i', 'held', 'attention', 'suspense', 'movie', 'had', 'watching', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'THe', 'main', 'plot', 'movie', 'young', 'lady', 'apartment', 'neighbor', 'just', 'keep', 'making', 'much', 'noise', 'sex', 'music', 'what', 'not', 'noise', 'just', 'keep', 'build', 'up', 'up', 'young', 'ladys', 'life', 'ending', 'very', 'surprising', 'wouldnt', 'hurt', 'watch', 'movie']",Noise
880787,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B0007GP7EQ,Lleu Christopher,"[7, 10]","Noise is the *kind* of movie I generally like and search for --independent, low budget and not overloaded with special effects and other Hollywood gimmicks. A psychological thriller like this has to rely on the fundamentals --character and story-- to keep the audience's attention. While I did find Noise interesting, and at times engrossing, for me it fell short in some important respects. The starring role is played by the unknown Trish Goff, who does a good job as Joyce, an unstable woman who moves into a new apartment after a traumatic divorce. This apartment is supposed to be in New York City, but given the paltry view of the streets (except for one shot of the Empire State Building), we can be sure it was filmed elsewhere. This may seem like a petty quibble, but it bothers me that so many films do this. If they can't film in New York, fine, but why say it's New York then?Joyce is pushed over the edge by Charlotte (Ally Sheedy), a very noisy and apparently deranged upstairs neighbor. I found the Charlotte character to be the film's weakest point. Ally Sheedy plays her as a kind of generic movie psychotic whose sole raison d'etre is apparently to torment Joyce.  While Goff, with her almost disconcertingly thin body and wide-eyed expression, manages to convey a real sense of someone on the edge of a breakdown, Sheedy's character is less believable and seems to belong in another film, perhaps a comedy. I just couldn't buy her madwoman routine here.There are other aspects to the film that are less than believable. A woman's group Joyce joins to help get over her divorce contains an unlikely amount of cattiness and trash-talking. At one point, Joyce takes out a personals ad in Charlotte's name. She does this as a counter-harassment measure, but it backfires and brings out the nymphomaniac in Charlotte.  To me, this was an obvious and contrived excuse to spice up the movie with some gratuitous sex. If this weren't enough, there are a couple of scenes where Joyce has erotic encounters with men she just met. Having to make both of these women fill their time with casual sex suggests a lack of confidence in what is supposed to be the real story. Given that no plausible motive is given for either Joyce's or Charlotte's behavior, especially towards the end (in movies like this, well-meaning friends always ask the very sensible question, ""why don't you just move?"" but the victim never listens), we can see why they felt the need to divert us. Noise has an interesting premise (which evokes some better films such as Roman Polanski's The Tenant), but only partially delivers.",2,"Has its moments, but lacks credibility",1114300800,"04 24, 2005",2005,2608,"['Noise', '*kind*', 'movie', 'generally', 'like', 'search', 'independent', 'low', 'budget', 'not', 'overloaded', 'special', 'effects', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'gimmicks', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'rely', 'fundamentals', 'character', 'story', 'keep', 'audience', 'attention', 'did', 'find', 'Noise', 'interesting', 'times', 'engrossing', 'fell', 'short', 'important', 'respects', 'starring', 'role', 'played', 'unknown', 'Trish', 'Goff', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'Joyce', 'unstable', 'woman', 'who', 'new', 'apartment', 'traumatic', 'divorce', 'apartment', 'supposed', 'be', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'given', 'paltry', 'view', 'streets', 'one', 'shot', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'was', 'filmed', 'elsewhere', 'may', 'seem', 'petty', 'quibble', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'film', 'New', 'York', 'fine', 'why', 'say', 'New', 'York', 'then', 'Joyce', 'pushed', 'edge', 'Charlotte', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'very', 'noisy', 'apparently', 'deranged', 'upstairs', 'neighbor', 'found', 'Charlotte', 'character', 'be', 'film', 'weakest', 'point', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'kind', 'generic', 'movie', 'psychotic', 'sole', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'apparently', 'torment', 'Joyce', 'Goff', 'almost', 'disconcertingly', 'thin', 'body', 'wide-eyed', 'expression', 'convey', 'real', 'sense', 'someone', 'edge', 'breakdown', 'Sheedy', 'character', 'less', 'believable', 'belong', 'film', 'perhaps', 'comedy', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'madwoman', 'routine', 'are', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'less', 'believable', 'woman', 'group', 'Joyce', 'help', 'get', 'divorce', 'unlikely', 'amount', 'cattiness', 'trash-talking', 'one', 'point', 'Joyce', 'out', 'personals', 'ad', 'Charlotte', 'name', 'counter-harassment', 'measure', 'out', 'nymphomaniac', 'Charlotte', 'was', 'obvious', 'contrived', 'excuse', 'spice', 'up', 'movie', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'Joyce', 'erotic', 'encounters', 'men', 'just', 'met', 'Having', 'make', 'women', 'fill', 'time', 'casual', 'sex', 'lack', 'confidence', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'real', 'story', 'Given', 'plausible', 'motive', 'given', 'Joyce', 'Charlotte', 'behavior', 'especially', 'end', 'movies', 'well-meaning', 'friends', 'always', 'ask', 'very', 'sensible', 'question', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'move', 'victim', 'never', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'felt', 'need', 'divert', 'Noise', 'interesting', 'premise', 'better', 'films', 'such', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Tenant', 'only', 'partially', 'delivers']",Noise

880789,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B0007GP7EQ,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 0]","I instantly connected with Joyce. I felt so bad for her since I dealt with something similar in 2003. We had an idiot neighbor who lived across the street and blasted his rap music in his boom car daily for over a year. The bass was so loud it shook the house. It drove me crazy. We called the cops repeatedly and even spoke to the guy and things didn't change. Eventually he moved away, thank goodness. But because of that I know how damaging loud noise can be. It can affect you mentally because it invades your peace of mind, almost making you wanna snap. Plenty of times I felt myself nearing the edge. It's horrible to be subjected to such torture but have no control over it. It wasn't difficult for me to see how Joyce made the leap from sane to insanely desperate. When you deal with this type of harassment you start to feel cornered.I liked this film. It is not an in-your-face thriller. At times it moves slow but each moment you're seeing deeper inside of Joyce and the type of person she is. She stays to herself and harbors many demons and by the time the film is over you realize that Joyce was her own worst enemy.Some things didn't make sense like why Joyce didn't move other than for them to have a movie. Joyce hadn't been in the apartment long enough at all for her to be attached so when the noise started she could've found somewhere to go. I'd have gone to a shelter before being terrorized like she was.But again, there has to be a reason for the movie and if she'd have moved there wouldn't have been any.The acting was good on all ends.
