653373,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B00005JPNE,Adrien Caldwell,"[2, 3]","I just watched this movie last night. I have to say that the middle portion lingered a lot but the ending was quite fascinating. I found myself rewinding the movie to catch certain details that were later replayed in the movie. Like the scene where the main female character gets bumped into as she's walking up the stairs. People who have seen this movie will understand what I'm talking about. I also found it interesting that the two characters (the supposed fraternal twins) wind up enduring the very same fate that they tried to escape as babies. One involving water and the other one, well, it was a bit more gruesome.This movie really wasn't about gore or something truly scary. To me it was something a bit deeper. For me it was about time lines and how, for some, a destiny is inevitable. And how inexorably determined spirits can cross into the physical world to claim something they feel is theirs.I didn't think the acting was bad either. It wasn't profound per se. I found humor in Karel Roden's ""toilet mouth"" outbursts when faced with something overwhelmingly scary. Maybe it's just me but I like it when a woman uses the ""F"" word. :)I'd actually like to give this movie ""3.5"" stars but that option isn't available. So I'm feeling generous and am giving it 4. I'm glad I rented it. As the movie climaxed to explain all the details toward the end, I thought it was quite creative.

653374,A26PEFWHKUHN7O,B00005JPNE,Captain Insanity,"[3, 4]","After 2 theatrical releases I really expected alot more from this flick.First off the advertisement led me to believe, at some point in the film, I would be seeing some sort of spooky, decaying doll.But that just never happens.And second off, Nacho Cerda's previous film Aftermath/Genesis was both; off the wall & artistic. With almost no spoken dialogue what-so-ever.I was kind of expecting something as extreme, or as artistic.What I got instead was a movie that starts out with potential,but ends up being kind of bland.The dialogue being the 400 lb. gorilla that weighs it down.The only scene in the entire movie that can be construed as extreme,is when the guy is getting his face eaten by a wild boar.Anyway;The first scene sets up the stories past.This is then followed by a long-winded intro.Which then leads to even more dull dialogue.And after about a half an hour the scares start, which predominantly consist of seeing a ghost and running away.To be honest, the scariest part of the movie is the setting.The abandoned family farm-house is just about the creepiest place you're ever likely to see in any horror movie.  And to be stuck there alone in the middle of the night.  Not on your life.The ghosts that inhabit said farmhouse, are dopplegangers of the main protagonists, who've returned home after 40 years.And when their dopplegangers get hurt, so do they.But not that you care, because the characters are so boring to begin with.What ensues is alot of senseless running around and multiple bouts with unconsciousness, followed by confusing lapses in continuity.After what seems like an eternity, we're finally given the explanation of what this is all about, provided via flashbacks into the past.Not that it makes much sense when you finally find out, mind you.But the past sequences are the best story this movie has to offer.The conclusion does nothing to clear up any of the confusion, but instead adds even more kindling to an already incoherent fire.Ultimately; you should only buy this,if you're into dream-like movies that are all about style over substance.But if you're a fan of Nacho Cerde, you might be very disappointed, by the lack of gore and surplus of droning dialogue.MORAL OF THE STORY:Much like Grandma & Grandpa, the past should remain dead & buried.",3,"What Starts as a Crawl, Turns into a Stumble",1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,2290,"['2', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'really', 'expected', 'alot', 'more', 'advertisement', 'led', 'believe', 'point', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'sort', 'spooky', 'decaying', 'doll.But', 'just', 'never', 'happens.And', 'second', 'off', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'previous', 'film', 'Aftermath/Genesis', 'was', 'off', 'wall', 'artistic', 'almost', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'what-so-ever.I', 'was', 'kind', 'expecting', 'something', 'extreme', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'movie', 'out', 'potential', 'up', 'being', 'kind', 'bland.The', 'dialogue', 'being', '400', 'lb', 'gorilla', 'only', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'construed', 'extreme', 'when', 'guy', 'getting', 'face', 'eaten', 'wild', 'boar.Anyway', 'first', 'scene', 'up', 'stories', 'past.This', 'then', 'followed', 'long-winded', 'intro.Which', 'then', 'even', 'more', 'dull', 'dialogue.And', 'half', 'hour', 'scares', 'start', 'predominantly', 'consist', 'seeing', 'ghost', 'running', 'away.To', 'be', 'honest', 'scariest', 'part', 'movie', 'setting.The', 'abandoned', 'family', 'farm-house', 'just', 'creepiest', 'place', ""'re"", 'ever', 'likely', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'be', 'stuck', 'alone', 'middle', 'night', 'Not', 'life.The', 'ghosts', 'inhabit', 'said', 'farmhouse', 'are', 'dopplegangers', 'main', 'protagonists', 'who', ""'ve"", 'returned', 'home', '40', 'years.And', 'when', 'dopplegangers', 'get', 'hurt', 'so', 'do', 'they.But', 'not', 'care', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'boring', 'begin', 'with.What', 'alot', 'senseless', 'running', 'around', 'multiple', 'bouts', 'unconsciousness', 'followed', 'confusing', 'lapses', 'continuity.After', 'what', 'eternity', ""'re"", 'finally', 'given', 'explanation', 'what', 'provided', 'flashbacks', 'past.Not', 'much', 'sense', 'when', 'finally', 'find', 'out', 'mind', 'you.But', 'past', 'sequences', 'are', 'best', 'story', 'movie', 'offer.The', 'conclusion', 'nothing', 'clear', 'up', 'confusion', 'instead', 'even', 'more', 'kindling', 'already', 'incoherent', 'fire.Ultimately', 'should', 'only', 'buy', ""'re"", 'dream-like', 'movies', 'are', 'style', 'substance.But', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Nacho', 'Cerde', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'gore', 'surplus', 'droning', 'dialogue.MORAL', 'THE', 'STORY', 'Much', 'Grandma', 'Grandpa', 'past', 'should', 'remain', 'dead', 'buried']",The Abandoned
653375,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B00005JPNE,Carl Manes,"[2, 3]","A woman with no past returns to Russia in search of her parents, but instead finds her long lost twin when she arrives at their parent's deserted farm house. As the two start off to find answers from their shrouded past, they uncover the ghosts of the past along with their evil doppelgangers that hope to trap their souls in after escaping death decades earlier. THE ABANDONED is very light on dialog but heavy on aesthetics and mood. Its cool green and blue filters build on the dilapidated sets and foggy exteriors to maintain the creepy atmosphere throughout the entire film. Director Nacho Cerda has an excellent cinematic eye, which he uses to create several effective shots. Faint images of the ghosts are revealed throughout the house when the flashlights quickly pass over them, and in a dramatic climax, Cerda also employs the use of reverse photography to watch as the ruinous sets rebuild themselves in frame. The ghastly doppelgangers that stalk the house also instill an intense fear through their silent movements and blank stares.

653377,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPNE,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 15]","""The Abandoned"" is all style but no substance, a great looking horror film with a needlessly cryptic story and virtually no character development. The filmmakers must have studied every haunted house movie ever made, because it looks and feels exactly the way a haunted house movie is supposed to look and feel. The hallways are dark. The walls are chipped, dirt coated, and shrouded with thick spider webs. The sounds of off screen creaks and groans fill the air. The atmosphere was right, but it only amounted to something that was scary just for the sake of being scary; there was nothing much holding it all together, and what little there was completely lacking in value.The main character is a woman named Marie (Anastasia Hille), an adopted Hollywood movie producer who was ""born in Russia, raised in England, and divorced in America."" She returns to her native Russia hoping to learn about her family heritage and find her true identity. All anyone seems to know for sure is that the mother was murdered back in 1966, when Marie was only an infant; there's absolutely no record of the father or any siblings. I find it baffling that a journey of self-discovery necessitates the character being a mystery to the audience. We do learn that she has a daughter named Emily; they have an argument over the phone. But that's all. Could nothing more have been revealed, namely her childhood experiences with her adoptive parents?Marie meets with a mysterious man who gives her the deeds to her mother's secluded estate. She's clearly hesitant to be a part of this; her only intention was to learn about her mother. Still, she decides to give the estate a quick once over. That's pretty much when the scary scenes begin piling on top of one another; they begin when she's offered a ride by another mysterious man. They stop in the middle of the woods, just in time for the convenient horror movie cliches to mount. The fog rolls in. The moon is ominously bright. Frightening noises surround them. Not only is it impossible to believe that anyone would tolerate this level of tension, it's also impossible to believe that anyone in a horror movie could do the same. And yet Marie plunges right in, leaving the car (after her driver disappears) and walking to the house.She enters to find that the house is completely dilapidated, as is expected in a haunted house movie. For a short while, nothing much happens, which I admit helps to build the suspense; she wanders from room to room (shouting the obligatory, ""Hello? Are you there,"" lines), with her flashlight serving as the only form of illumination. Then she sees a woman wandering the halls, a woman that's pale and sopping wet. We quickly discover that this woman is the spitting image of Marie (minus the eyes, which lack both irises and pupils). And that's when she runs. She leaves the house, runs through the forest, and falls into the river.She then wakes up in the presence of the film's third mysterious man. His name is Nicolai (Karel Roden), and as it turns out, he's Marie's long lost twin brother. I truly disliked this character; he's stereotypically elusive, yet always seems to have an answer for everything. I suppose this would have worked had his circumstances not been so ridiculous. He claims that both he and Marie were lured back to this house, and that the forces at work are trying to keep them there forever. How he came to these conclusions is anyone's guess; he supposedly only arrived at the house only a few days before Marie, which I don't think is nearly enough time to have the sinister plot figured out. Top that off with the fact that he, too, has a ghoulish clone wandering the house. He explains that whatever physically happens to the doppelganger will have the same effect on the real person. If he understood this, then I can't understand why he would shoot his own doppelganger in the leg.The rest of the film works at pretty much the same level, with many more scenes of aimless hallway wandering, unexplained supernatural occurrences, and nonsensical plot twists. I distinctly remember a frenetic scene of the house restoring itself back to the way it looked in 1966 (surprisingly, it didn't look much better than it does in present day, save for working electricity). According to Answer Man Nicolai, the house is recreating the night of their mother's murder. He also says that this time, the murderer will succeed in killing them as infants. Am I honestly supposed to take such unfounded claims seriously, even if he's right? What about his stay at the House of Terror would lead him to this idea? He says that he saw the past while walking through a flooded underground tunnel, which would have been believable if only Marie had a similar experience. She didn't. All she experiences are more creepy noises.It would be unfair of me to say that I knew what to expect from ""The Abandoned."" Nonetheless, I was definitely not expecting this; this is an extremely haphazard film, weak in story, characterization, and plot advancement. It's all made worse by completely unnecessary bookend narrations courtesy of Marie's daughter. Her understanding of her mother's search for her past is incredibly flimsy; Emily claims that she will never go searching for her past, like her mother did. Only in this kind of film can a character understand someone's fate without having been there to witness it. It simply made no sense. The same can be said for the film in general. Not too long ago I reviewed ""The Messengers,"" another haunted house film that was too cliched to allow for a recommendation. While I stand by my review, I can also say this with absolute certainty: you'd be better off seeing that than ""The Abandoned.""",2,Home is Where the Fright is,1172188800,"02 23,

653379,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPNE,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","When it comes down to the horror genre, no genre is probably as common as the ""haunted "" movie. From apartments to basements to houses, you find these kind of films everywhere and for the most part, some of them work while others get way familiar and don't really offer anything new. Sure they have an effective scare or 2 but they don't really have anything that you haven't seen before or anything to distinguish it. Not trying to hype up the Abandoned as a completely original horror film - it's far from it, actually - but you get the feeling that you've probably watched one of the better ones in awhile.Marie Jones is an older, yet still attractive woman who grew up never knowing her parents. Flying to Russia, she finds out that her parents are dead and that there's a property that's now yours, namely that of their farmhouse. Taking a trip over there, she finds another man, Nikolai, who he says is her twin brother, and they also find someone else in the house. They try to solve the mystery of what's in the house and what happened to their parents.It's quite refreshing to watch a film like this since there's a sense of reality that shines through it. Since the actors or by-and-large unrecognizable, a small budget and a restrained approach to CG effects makes the film use tension and pacing to make us uneasy and for the most part it does that. While it does have a bunch of characters calling out each other's names and wandering slowly through stuff, the more scarier scenes at least keep you on edge. One scene involving a flashlight and the images it reveals I thought was quite neat but then one scene involving a certain barn animal near the end I felt went too much into High Tension territory (gore for the sake of it).Where the film severely loses points is in its plot. Now, horror films aren't known for needing big, detailed stories but with this film, they try to inject a more layered script but in the end it feels overly complicated. It's one of those stories that most people would probably have to look up on the internet and found out what in the world happened.

653381,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00005JPNE,Dave. K,"[3, 5]","The Abandoned had all the makings of what could have been a instant classic, but somewhere along the way the movie just mostly failed. There was a lot of hype for the 8 films to die for and I'm quite surprised at how many people bought into the hype. Of the few I have seen I found most to be ok. Nothing I'd be in a rush to see again, but nothing horrible. The Abandoned on the other hand was the weakest of the ones I have seen.When a film fails most of the blame is put on the director, but in this case a director with a lot of potential was failed by the script. Seeing as Nacho Cerda was also one of the writers I guess he is too blame at least a little bit. The screenplay was written Karim Hussain, Nacho Cerda and Richard Stanley and while the script wasn't bad per se, it was very boring. The Abandoned had a decent idea, but the execution with the script was very much off. Again it's not so much that it was bad as it was very boring. The characters are very weak; Marie Jones played by Anastasia Hille was the lead and she lacked any depth, which sometimes doesn't matter, but what does matter is if the character is likeable and in my opinion she wasn't.For me the movies I find the creepiest are the ones where I'm invested in the characters. If I don't like them and don't care what happens to them all suspense and tension is lost and that was the case for The Abandoned. While Anastasia Hille does deliver a good performance I disliked the character and what made it worse is she is in pretty much every scene and there are long stretches when it's just her. The actress does a good job and it's not easy doing so many scenes on your own, so it's nothing against the actress, but the writers.Director Nacho Cerda clearly had the right idea; his goal was to scare you from start to finish. Based off my viewing of The Abandoned I would be interested in seeing more of his work in the future I do think he has potential. First off visually the movie is beautiful. Nacho Cerda does a great job at creating a very eerie visual look and his scenes in general are well paced. But it goes back to what I said earlier. If I don't like the characters the suspense and tension is lost. There is a highly effective scene in which Marie searches around the abandoned farmhouse, which does provide am eerie and some what creepy feel.Early on the horror starts and is pretty constant through the whole picture, but with the lack of a likeable character I found myself really bored rather than scared at all. This is the type of movie that will go one of two ways based on the reviews I have read. Either this movie will freak you out or it will bore you. That is the common theme based on reviews. I can see how this can possible creep people out, but seeing as I was bored with it I can see how a lot of people would feel that way. The Abandoned had all the makings of a great horror movie, but again due to very weak characters all the suspense and tension is lost. With a better script this could have been a really creepy movie Nacho Cerda seems like he has the talent, but with everything else lacking here nothing really seems to work.By the hour mark I pretty much lost all interest. Again this is a movie that will either scare you or bore you. And sadly it was the latter for me.",2,"Had the makings of a classic, but falls very short",1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,3292,"['Abandoned', 'had', 'makings', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'instant', 'classic', 'somewhere', 'way', 'movie', 'just', 'mostly', 'failed', 'was', 'lot', 'hype', '8', 'films', 'die', ""'m"", 'quite', 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'bought', 'hype', 'few', 'have', 'seen', 'found', 'most', 'be', 'ok', 'Nothing', ""'d"", 'be', 'rush', 'see', 'again', 'nothing', 'horrible', 'Abandoned', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'weakest', 'ones', 'have', 'seen.When', 'film', 'most', 'blame', 'put', 'director', 'case', 'director', 'lot', 'potential', 'was', 'failed', 'script', 'Seeing', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'writers', 'guess', 'too', 'blame', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Karim', 'Hussain', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'Richard', 'Stanley', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'se', 'was', 'very', 'boring', 'Abandoned', 'had', 'decent', 'idea', 'execution', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'Again', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'very', 'boring', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'weak', 'Marie', 'Jones', 'played', 'Anastasia', 'Hille', 'was', 'lead', 'lacked', 'depth', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'matter', 'character', 'likeable', 'opinion', ""wasn't.For"", 'movies', 'find', 'creepiest', 'are', 'ones', 'where', ""'m"", 'invested', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'suspense', 'tension', 'lost', 'was', 'case', 'Abandoned', 'Anastasia', 'Hille', 'deliver', 'good', 'performance', 'disliked', 'character', 'what', 'made', 'worse', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'when', 'just', 'actress', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'easy', 'doing', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'own', 'nothing', 'actress', 'writers.Director', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'clearly', 'had', 'right', 'idea', 'goal', 'was', 'scare', 'start', 'finish', 'Based', 'off', 'viewing', 'Abandoned', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'more', 'work', 'future', 'do', 'think', 'potential', 'First', 'visually', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'very', 'eerie', 'visual', 'look', 'scenes', 'general', 'are', 'well', 'paced', 'back', 'what', 'said', 'earlier', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'characters', 'suspense', 'tension', 'lost', 'highly', 'effective', 'scene', 'Marie', 'abandoned', 'farmhouse', 'provide', 'am', 'eerie', 'what', 'creepy', 'feel.Early', 'horror', 'starts', 'pretty', 'constant', 'whole', 'picture', 'lack', 'likeable', 'character', 'found', 'really', 'bored', 'rather', 'scared', 'type', 'movie', 'will', 'go', 'one', 'two', 'ways', 'based', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'movie', 'will', 'freak', 'out', 'will', 'bore', 'common', 'theme', 'based', 'reviews', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'possible', 'creep', 'people', 'out', 'seeing', 'was', 'bored', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'feel', 'way', 'Abandoned', 'had', 'makings', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'again', 'due', 'very', 'weak', 'characters', 'suspense', 'tension', 'lost', 'better', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'creepy', 'movie', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'talent', 'everything', 'else', 'lacking', 'here', 'nothing', 'really', 'work.By', 'hour', 'mark', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'interest', 'Again', 'movie', 'will', 'either', 'scare', 'bore', 'sadly', 'was', 'latter']",The Abandoned

When the After Dark Horror Fest was announced I was incredibly excited, especially when it came to The Abandoned.  Helmed by Spanish director Nacho Cerda(the mind behind the disturbing and beautifully shot short films Aftermath and Genesis) and featuring a script co-written by Richard Stanley(writer/director of overlooked horror classics Hardware and Dust Devil), The Abandoned should have been amazing but... The story follows a woman on the arrival back to her birth place in Russia, where she seeks out answers from her mysterious past, however; her mysterious past seems to be searching for her as well.  I'm sure the script was written deliberately slow as it allows for Cerda to create some fantastic atmosphere by chewing up the creepy scenery with long ponderous shots that do plant the seed of dread to come, unfortunately though, the buildup is wasted with an ending that doesn't deliver on scares or answers for what's been happening for the last hour and fifteen minutes.  The end result is the most upsetting film from the already overly disappointing After Dark horror fest, and it's far from the worst of the batch, but it had so much potential and promise that it stands out the most.  The cinematography and atmosphere are both great but then... nothing really happens?  With some decent payoffs (or even payoff)the movie could be awesome... maybe a directors cut with added footage?  As is, The Abandoned feels like it was written as another Cerda short film but was stretched in an attempt to create a feature length movie and it drags plenty to support that thought.  Nacho Cerda is still a director to keep an eye out for in the future, just hopefully not attached to another script like this.

Yes indeed this is from the first set that is at about three sets now, so I am sure you remember this one. When the first set was released there was a lot of hype behind these 8 Films to Die For, this one in particular. So how did this one fair in the series, well this may be the best from the first set or at least close to it. I had a certain amount of expectation for this one since it got that special release.The story follows a woman who is traveling to Russia to learn more about her family, her parents to be exact. Upon arriving there things get a bit weird but things are ok at first, but that changes soon. Things start going bump and there seems to be a dead version of her self that wants to get at her. Also add in some guy that seems to know all about her which I guess it makes sense he says he is her brother. Once he gets there things really heat up especially since there is an evil version of him as well. As the mystery that is her parents and her life stat to unravel she has to find a way out before it is to late.The story is actually interesting and has some cool little twists that may keep you interested, Karim Hussain, Richard Stanley, and director Nacho Cerd&agrave; should be credited for that. The direction in this film is great and the atmosphere created through out is excellent. Another thing that is strong in this film is the cinematography because there are a lot of beautiful shots like the opening shots of the land. There is a lot to like about this movie like the acting is good in this one, well for the most part but the lead seemed like she was straining at times. To be honest though there were times when I had some attention on something else so that may be the reason I feel that way.Things aren't perfect though like some times the film seems a little less interesting if that is believable because this is actually good. Still the twists that this film takes while not hard to figure out really for the most part will keep you interested. When compared to others in the series from the first set to the latest this may be one of the better ones at least from my point of view.

If you notice the reviews are mostly positive, with a few negative which seem either to have short attention spans thus bored by the slowness, or they are expecting a different movie. (the advertisement led me to believe, I would be seeing some sort of spooky, decaying doll-- one reviewer states)So these facts tell you that this movie will put you off guard which is one mark of a great film. I was at times saying WTF (in a good way) trying to figure out the mystery. When the reveal happens its outright acid flash back. The Abandoned is more conceptual than  anything so of coarse there are a few whom won't get it and there are some unbelieveable parts but I suggest go with it you will have more fun. If you believe in the concept this movie works on all levels.  Few films are perfect and when you rent this realize your RENTING a movie and not bought stock in the company thus having unrealistic expectations. I personally will buy this, a movie I feel is a modern horror masterpiece.As for as the 8 Movies To Die for series, I have seen Dark Ride (which was Ok), Penny Dreadful (amazingly dreadful but somehow entertaining) and The Abandoned which is so much more superior than those movies its no question.Overall 5 high stars, with a recommendation to buy.

With blood splatter and desperation encouraging the female driver's foot, the gas pedal hugs the floor for more speed.  When the truck crashes onto the farm property the family jolts from dinner, wielding a shotgun, to investigate the loud commotion.  The door is opened, and a dead mother is discovered with screaming twin babies in the passenger seat.Flash forward 40 years.A female movie producer with a mixed past - birth in Russia, raised in England, divorced in the U.S. - is contacted by Russian officials and told of an isolated island inheritance.  Desperate to seek out her birth-mother, she answers the call with ulterior motives in mind.  Upon her arrival in Russia, she discovers her past may have been best left alone.The choice of protagonist is a bit different, with relative unknown Anastasia Hille being chosen as Marie, but the selection is spot-on.  Not only does Hille perform excellently, capturing the fear and paranoia believably, but her appearance is ideal for the role.  Director Nacho Cerda sets up a wonderfully suspenseful ride chock full of dark corners, tense horror, and an overall vibe that exudes creepiness.  Similarly, the concept is fairly dark and original, scares and hauntings spawning more from aural fear than the common dark to light, or quiet to loud so typical in lazy horror.  Speaking of the auditory, Alfonse Conde's original score is menacing.  Along with the thunderous bass and a variety of screeching sounds - both animal and human - accompanying the rusty pipes, dripping water, misfiring electricity and creaking floorboards that make old, abandoned houses so terrifying, the score blends smoothly with the theme as well as the story.  The gore and special effects are used sparingly and very effectively.  Great production job all around; and a nearly flawless ending rounds out a solid story, making the film very exciting and enjoyable.This is recommended for a late night scare and for horror fans in general.  This is better and has more potential than the majority of big box office horror, and it's worth the viewing.Jason Elin",4,Do NOT invite me to the next Russian Family Reunion!,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,2229,"['quiet', 'Russian', 'farming', 'family', 'sits', 'down', 'pious', 'dinner', 'rusty', 'weathered', 'truck', 'speeds', 'down', 'dirt', 'road', 'littered', 'pot-holes', 'blood', 'splatter', 'desperation', 'encouraging', 'female', 'driver', 'foot', 'gas', 'pedal', 'floor', 'more', 'speed', 'When', 'truck', 'crashes', 'farm', 'property', 'family', 'jolts', 'dinner', 'wielding', 'shotgun', 'investigate', 'loud', 'commotion', 'door', 'opened', 'dead', 'mother', 'discovered', 'screaming', 'twin', 'babies', 'passenger', 'forward', '40', 'years.A', 'female', 'movie', 'producer', 'mixed', 'past', 'birth', 'Russia', 'raised', 'England', 'divorced', 'U.S.', 'contacted', 'Russian', 'officials', 'told', 'isolated', 'island', 'inheritance', 'Desperate', 'seek', 'out', 'birth-mother', 'call', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'mind', 'arrival', 'Russia', 'past', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'left', 'alone.The', 'choice', 'protagonist', 'bit', 'different', 'relative', 'unknown', 'Anastasia', 'Hille', 'being', 'chosen', 'Marie', 'selection', 'spot-on', 'Not', 'only', 'Hille', 'perform', 'excellently', 'capturing', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'believably', 'appearance', 'ideal', 'role', 'Director', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'up', 'wonderfully', 'suspenseful', 'ride', 'chock', 'full', 'dark', 'corners', 'tense', 'horror', 'overall', 'vibe', 'creepiness', 'Similarly', 'concept', 'fairly', 'dark', 'original', 'scares', 'hauntings', 'spawning', 'more', 'aural', 'fear', 'common', 'dark', 'light', 'quiet', 'loud', 'so', 'typical', 'lazy', 'horror', 'Speaking', 'auditory', 'Alfonse', 'Conde', 'original', 'score', 'menacing', 'thunderous', 'bass', 'variety', 'screeching', 'sounds', 'animal', 'human', 'accompanying', 'rusty', 'pipes', 'dripping', 'water', 'misfiring', 'electricity', 'creaking', 'floorboards', 'make', 'old', 'abandoned', 'houses', 'so', 'terrifying', 'score', 'smoothly', 'theme', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'gore', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'sparingly', 'very', 'effectively', 'Great', 'production', 'job', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'ending', 'out', 'solid', 'story', 'making', 'film', 'very', 'exciting', 'enjoyable.This', 'recommended', 'late', 'night', 'scare', 'horror', 'fans', 'general', 'better', 'more', 'potential', 'majority', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'horror', 'viewing.Jason', 'Elin']",The Abandoned

I went to all of the afternoon shows, so basically it was the same bunch of us watching each film. I bought all my tickets up front so I have the t-shirt, which features art that has nothing to do with any of the films. We just about memorized the one trailer that they showed us nine times (if you had all eight ticket stubs or your face was well known to the cashier you got to see a ninth film, ""Snoop Dog's Hood of Horror""), and dissected each film and talking about our current favorites with ""Audition"" being the prime recommendation. We also made our predictions for which film would be selected as the one of the eight that would get a real theatrical run.""The Abandoned"" was not our choice, although it was certainly in the top half of that weekend's offerings (I would rank it third out of the eight). Our favorite was ""Penny Dreadful"" by director Richard Brandes, because we thought it made the most of a rather simple situation: crazed killer traps terrified teen (Rachel Miner) by wedging the car she is in between two trees in a forest so she cannot get out and we were impressed by what all they came up with in that confined situation. Our prediction was ""Dark Ride,"" which starred Jamie-Lynn Sigler, because we thought it was the most commercial of the bunch. After ""Dark Ride"" and ""The Gravedancers"" we had this running riff about how the climax of a film involved the heroine driving a truck through a building at the right time (and place). So when ""The Abandoned"" started with a woman driving an old truck up to a farm house in Russia and dropping dead, leaving the farmer to find a pair of infants in the truck we were laughing how the truck element was becoming a dominant theme in these movies, epitomized by ""Penny Dreadful.""""The Abandoned"" is one of those movies where the prologue is a prelude to the main action of the film, which takes place four decades later. Marie (Anastasia Hille) has grown up in America and when she learns she has inherited the house in which she was born she heads for a remote forest in Russia. There she finds a house that has been neglected pretty much since the day she was born. There she meets Nikolai (Karel Roden), who claims to be the twin brother she never knew about. Obviously these are the two babies who were in the truck when their dying mother delivered them to safety. Together they will uncover the past they were too young to remember, and learn why the abandoned house if haunted by not only their past, but by what appears to be their futures as well.This 2006 horror film is directed by Nacho Cerda (""Aftermath,"" ""Genesis""), with a script by Cerda, Karim Hussain (""Ascension""), and Richard Stanley (""The Island of Dr. Moreau""). This is a Spanish production (which explains cinematographer Xavi Gimenez, whose work was far and away the best of the Horrorfest), filmed in Bulgaria passing for Russia, but with most of the dialogue is in English. The rural setting of the main action is of more importance than the foreign local, but it is also different to have the two main characters be a pair of fortyish siblings, which means a horror film with neither teen angst nor romantic entanglements. True, you could make the two characters twentish or thirtish without changing anything essentially to the story, but having the leads being basically twice the age of your normal main characters in a horror film does lend a certain gravity to things. A lot of what happens here is disturbing, based more on our understanding of what is going on, and not by a driving interest in engaging our gag reflexes by showing blood and guts.There is what can be considered a science fiction element thrown into the end game, somewhat unnecessarily I think, but for me the film's flaw lies elsewhere. I fully admit that it might not bother most people but for me it was one of those moments where I roll my eyes and (to clean up the phrase) request I be provided with a respite from sexual intercourse. It has to do with the revelation of how Marie was brought from America to Russia for all these fun and games. I understand the whole idea of vengeance from beyond the grave and that somebody can be more powerful after death, but better educated? That I cannot buy. I was still shaking my head over that one when the film finished, which is why I was no longer having to decide to round up or round down on the film. Still, all things considered, ""The Abandoned"" is different enough from the usual fare of horror films for aficionados to check out. I fully admit that I never would have seen it in a theater if it had not been part of the Horrorfest ride, but then except for the ""Saw"" films I watch pretty much all of my horror films late at night on DVD and this one is at least worth checking out on that basis.",4,The film from Horrorfest 2006 that earned its own release,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,4907,"['was', 'pleasantly',

CYCLOPS section.  I actually have never seen him give a rating over 2 1/2 eyeballs out of 4 that I can recall and I've been getting Fangoria now for about a year and a half to two years, so when i saw him give 3 1/2 eyeballs on the cyclops rating and made it video of the month i had to pick it up.  I figured either it's gonna be good and I'd have a good reference for horror, or even better all the movies he thought sucked maybe were actually great.At first i was hesitant, ok so she runs away from this house crosses a lake runs all day and boom she's back at the house she started at, Blair Witch Project anyone.  The above referenced house that her parents owned in 1966 is surrounded on all sides by water only way out is a bridge that resembles the bridge in Evil Dead 2, Who are these peoples real estate agents?  Perhaps the same that sold the Amity ville house and just relocated to Russia.  The house basically eats her brother, I was waiting to hear Kathleen Turners raspy voice from Monster house.  Then i stopped trying to find things wrong, what horror movie can't you poke holes in and  how hard must it be to at least not be subconsciously influenced by other horror movies i mean everything has been done, and writer director Nacho Cerd&agrave; does put his own spin on this.I can also see what DR. CYCLOPS means when in his review he says that ""the film's deliberate pacing (particularly during its wandering about in circles midsection) might annoy ADD-afflicted viewers in search of typical hollywood horror hokum"".  Not this viewer I'm always looking for something different and i wasn't let down.  This movie is best to not analyze until it's over and you look at it as a whole without breaking it down into parts.So, the plot it's pretty simple, SIKE, it's anything but.  An adopted woman from Ca returns to where she was born in Russia seeking information about her mother.  She leaves behind a daughter of her own who she briefly argues with about having her older boyfriend in the house.A man she meets with in Russia tells her that her mother's house has been left to her.She is driven to her mother's house by an unknown man in a truck that looks straight out of Jeepers Creepers.  Once there the man disappears and soon after she meets another man in the house who is there for the same reasons as her own.  Soon ghostly manifestations show up actually more zombie like, well the man (who is this man?) has a gun, so shoot them right, k bang, whoops he shoots the zombie in the leg and he ends up with a bullet in his own leg.  This zombie looks allot like him, oh it is him, i know what your thinking and your wrong.  I'll say this, it's a good thing he didn't see any zombie movies, if it was me I'd shoot the zombie in the head without hesitation and then the movie would only be about 60mins.  What happens after this I'll leave to you.On a serious note this is a horror movie like a lot of horror movies that just might be trying to say something.  Maybe we shouldn't chase the past.  Maybe things happen for a reason be it the end of a relationship or growing up without parents, more literally.  Perhaps things are better left alone and we should move on and not dwell on or dig up the past, especially if your last name is Kaidavosky and your family tree resembles the tree from Poltergeist, it might just be better to be ""Abandoned""!I've heard negative things from the After Dark Horrorfest movies i personally found the majority to be pretty good.  Other than this Gravedancers, Unrest, The Hamiltons, and Reincarnation were all pretty freaky.  They all try to be scary and take themselves seriously.I'll be interested in catching some of the new one's in After Dark Horrorfest 2, in the meantime check this one out, let me know what you think.One other thing The Dolby Digital 5.1 Track also gave my Sonus Faber speakers a pretty good work out.",4,"A deeper darker look at the Final Destination concept, where death takes the form of an abusive parent.",1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,4158,"['However', 'death', 'little', 'more', 'patient', 'Final', 'Destination', ""'ll"", 'give', '40', 'years', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'destination', 'death', 'might', 'just', 'leave', 'alone.I', 'read', 'review', 'Abandoned', 'August', '2007', 'issue', 'Fangoria', '265', 'VIDEO', 'EYE', 'OF', 'DR.', 'CYCLOPS', 'section', 'actually', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'give', 'rating', '2', '1/2', 'eyeballs', '4', 'can', 'recall', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'Fangoria', 'now', 'year', 'half', 'two', 'years', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'eyeballs', 'cyclops', 'rating', 'made', 'video', 'month', 'i', 'had', 'pick', 'up', 'figured', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'good', ""'d"", 'have', 'good', 'reference', 'horror', 'even', 'better', 'movies', 'thought', 'sucked', 'maybe', 'were', 'actually', 'great.At', 'first', 'i', 'was', 'hesitant', 'ok', 'away', 'house', 'lake', 'day', 'boom', 'back', 'house', 'started', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'anyone', 'above', 'referenced', 'house', 'parents', 'owned', '1966', 'surrounded', 'sides', 'water', 'only', 'way', 'out', 'bridge', 'bridge', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2', 'Who', 'are', 'peoples', 'real', 'estate', 'agents', 'Perhaps', 'same', 'sold', 'Amity', 'ville', 'house', 'just', 'relocated', 'Russia', 'house', 'basically', 'brother', 'was', 'waiting', 'hear', 'Kathleen', 'Turners', 'raspy', 'voice', 'Monster', 'house', 'Then', 'i', 'stopped', 'trying', 'find', 'things', 'wrong', 'what', 'horror', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'poke', 'holes', 'how', 'hard', 'must', 'be', 'least', 'not', 'be', 'subconsciously', 'influenced', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'i', 'mean', 'everything', 'been', 'done', 'writer', 'director', 'Nacho', 'Cerd', 'agrave', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'this.I', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'what', 'DR.', 'CYCLOPS', 'when', 'review', 'film', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'particularly', 'wandering', 'circles', 'midsection', 'might', 'annoy', 'ADD-afflicted', 'viewers', 'search', 'typical', 'hollywood', 'horror', 'hokum', 'Not', 'viewer', ""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'movie', 'best', 'not', 'analyze', 'look', 'whole', 'breaking', 'down', 'parts.So', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'SIKE', 'anything', 'adopted', 'woman', 'Ca', 'returns', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'Russia', 'seeking', 'information', 'mother', 'daughter', 'own', 'who', 'briefly', 'argues', 'about', 'having', 'older', 'boyfriend', 'house.A', 'man', 'Russia', 'mother', 'house', 'been', 'left', 'her.She', 'driven', 'mother', 'house', 'unknown', 'man', 'truck', 'straight', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'Once', 'man', 'soon', 'man', 'house', 'who', 'there', 'same', 'reasons', 'own', 'Soon', 'ghostly', 'manifestations', 'show', 'up', 'actually', 'more', 'zombie', 'well', 'man', 'who', 'man', 'gun', 'so', 'shoot', 'right', 'k', 'bang', 'zombie', 'leg', 'up', 'bullet', 'own', 'leg', 'zombie', 'allot', 'i', 'know', 'what', 'thinking', 'wrong', ""'ll"", 'say', 'good', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'zombie', 'movies', 'was', ""'d"", 'shoot', 'zombie', 'head', 'hesitation', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'about', '60mins', 'What', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'you.On', 'serious', 'note', 'horror', 'movie', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'trying', 'say', 'something', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'chase', 'past', 'Maybe', 'things', 'happen', 'reason', 'be', 'end', 'relationship', 'growing', 'up', 'parents', 'more', 'literally', 'Perhaps', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'alone', 'should', 'move', 'not', 'dwell', 'dig', 'up', 'past', 'especially', 'last', 'name', 'Kaidavosky', 'family', 'tree', 'tree', 'Poltergeist', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'better', 'be', 'Abandoned', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'negative', 'things', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'movies', 'i', 'personally', 'found', 'majority', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'Other', 'Gravedancers', 'Unrest', 'Hamiltons', 'Reincarnation', 'were', 'pretty', 'freaky', 'try', 'be', 'scary', 'take', 'seriously.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interested', 'catching', 'new', 'one', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', '2', 'meantime', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'think.One', 'other', 'thing', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Track', 'also', 'gave', 'Sonus', 'Faber', 'speakers', 'pretty', 'good', 'work', 'out']",The Abandoned

That happens, in part, because while American horror films have long ago discarded mood and pace and gone for gore and cheap scares, Europeans are still faithful to those timeless elements we love to find in a horror film.Like many other European films likeThe Others (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)andInside, this is one of those films that show us why, right now, there is nothing like European horror films.Tired of seeing great ideas wasted in bad films, I'm happy to say this film really satisfied me.

653411,A3BKIVVRFP7X6M,B00005JPNE,R.C. Collins,"[6, 8]","The Abandoned is the story of a woman born in Russia but who was adopted as a baby and is now going back to Russia from her life in the U.S. to find out about her birth parents. The summons leads her to the old family farm, which she has the legal right to. Once she arrives there, dark family secrets arise, evil forces abound, and even when the woman decides to leave the house, she finds that she cannot.It is, perhaps, not the most original plot. Certainly there have been movies where a person has gone searching for information about their ancestors and found a haunted house. But the setup was rather well done. There was a nice sense of foreboding and trouble brewing. I also liked Anastasia Hille, the woman who plays the main character. Most ghost story movies with a female heroine typically cast a much younger woman who tend to look out of place. That's not to say Anastasia Hille blended in with the decrepit house but it just felt more authentic that this woman was interesting in her past - as compared to a 20 year old model who would be more interested in going clubbing than investigating some old house in Russia. Regardless, I was on board from the beginning of the film. It started with a nice pace and an excellent atmosphere.And that is where the movie fell apart. The plot jumps around from point to point. The characters become relegated to set pieces, waiting for the next shocking vision to occur. They never seem to take full shape as real people. The exciting climax also leaves a lot to be desired.I did like some of the special effects and makeup work at the end, where things got very graphic. [There is gore, briefly but spectacularly done.] But the confused plot and rather predictable ending [coupled with the disease of having too many endings where none have any impact] leave a lot to be desired.

I won't go into the synopsis as you can read that with other reviews, but I will say this, the movie was very original, not formulaic, and I had no idea where the scares were going to come from next. I think one of the main reasons I really enjoyed this movie was the 5.1 digital surround. If you see this movie, make sure you have a 5.1 surround system, turn down the lights, and crank it up. I promise you, you will hear things in your house that will creep the daylights out of you.Now, I have seen all the 8 films and this is by far the best with GRAVEDANCERS being the next best. THE ABANDONED did not rely on gore or cheap thrills to scare you. The director really built up the atmosphere and the feelings of doom in this movie. I did not see the ending coming and anyone who does say that is gravely mistaken.

653413,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JPNE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","The Abandoned (Nacho Cerda, 2006)The more I know about The Abandoned, the less sure I am about reviewing it. I've already held off for well over a month, reading about it, rewatching pieces of it time and again, and trying to reconcile all the different pieces of what I know with the movie itself. By rights, The Abandoned should both be one of the best movies I've ever seen and one of the worst. Talk about a conundrum.The Abandoned takes place somewhere that the backwoods would call backwoods--a farm in Russia that's days away from the nearest town. Marie (The Wisdom of Crocodiles' Anastasia Hille), adopted as a baby and taken to America, has been tracked down after the death of her mother under mysterious circumstances, and told that she has inherited the family farm. She hires a guide to take her out there and, after a long day's drive, they arrive, only to have her guide hear something, get out of the truck to investigate, and never return. So she goes up to explore the farm herself, and quickly finds out that things are not at all as they seem. Not only is the place haunted, but another live visitor turns up--Nicolai (RocknRolla's Karel Roden), who, it seems, has gotten the same story from the lawyer. Things get really weird when the two of them find themselves being haunted by their own ghosts...The Abandoned, despite being one of the films distributed theatrically by After Dark, who are notorious for finding the least horrific horror films of any given year and playing them up, has quite the sterling horror pedigree, from two stars who are well-versed in the genre to Nacho Cerda, a director notorious for helming one of the most reviled and extreme short films known to man (Aftermath). The original screenplay was worked up by Karim Hussain (The Beautiful Beast), then reworked just before production by Richard Stanley (Dust Devil). Cinematographer Xavi Gimenez has done some of the genre's best work in the past decade, including Brad Anderson's last two movies, Intacto, and Jaume Balaguero's Darkness (about which the only decent thing was Gimenez' cinematography). And I could go on like this all night; this was absolutely an all-star crew. And don't get me wrong, this is a very good movie, especially when you juxtapose it with the crap that After Dark usually assault us with. For an After Dark movie, this is head and shoulders above anything they've ever touched (and, likely, anything they ever will). But still, something about it just rubs me the wrong way, and it all has to do with Nacho Cerda; this is a Nacho Cerda film that doesn't feel, in any way, shape, or form, like a Nacho Cerda film, and that bugs me.But that may just be me; everyone who worked on this film brought their A games to the table, and they've created something very nice to look at. It just seems to lack pieces of the soul it should, by rights, have. But don't let that stop you from checking it out; if you have always avoided Cerda because of his reputation, this is by far your best starting point. ***",3,"While I expected a great deal more from Cerda, what I got wasn't bad at all.",1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,3030,"['Abandoned', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', '2006', 'more', 'know', 'Abandoned', 'less', 'sure', 'am', 'reviewing', ""'ve"", 'already', 'held', 'off', 'well', 'month', 'reading', 'rewatching', 'pieces', 'time', 'again', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'different', 'pieces', 'what', 'know', 'movie', 'rights', 'Abandoned', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'worst', 'Talk', 'conundrum.The', 'Abandoned', 'place', 'somewhere', 'backwoods', 'would', 'call', 'backwoods', 'farm', 'Russia', 'days', 'away', 'nearest', 'town', 'Marie', 'Wisdom', 'Crocodiles', 'Anastasia', 'Hille', 'adopted', 'baby', 'taken', 'America', 'been', 'tracked', 'down', 'death', 'mother', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'told', 'inherited', 'family', 'farm', 'guide', 'take', 'long', 'day', 'drive', 'arrive', 'only', 'have', 'guide', 'hear', 'something', 'get', 'truck', 'investigate', 'never', 'return', 'up', 'explore', 'farm', 'herself', 'quickly', 'out', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'seem', 'Not', 'only', 'place', 'haunted', 'live', 'visitor', 'up', 'Nicolai', 'RocknRolla', 'Karel', 'Roden', 'who', 'gotten', 'same', 'story', 'lawyer', 'Things', 'get', 'really', 'weird', 'when', 'two', 'find', 'being', 'haunted', 'own', 'ghosts', 'Abandoned', 'being', 'one', 'films', 'distributed', 'theatrically', 'Dark', 'who', 'are', 'notorious', 'finding', 'least', 'horrific', 'horror', 'films', 'given', 'year', 'playing', 'up', 'quite', 'sterling', 'horror', 'pedigree', 'two', 'stars', 'who', 'are', 'well-versed', 'genre', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'director', 'notorious', 'helming', 'one', 'most', 'reviled', 'extreme', 'short', 'films', 'known', 'man', 'Aftermath', 'original', 'screenplay', 'was', 'worked', 'up', 'Karim', 'Hussain', 'Beautiful', 'Beast', 'then', 'reworked', 'just', 'production', 'Richard', 'Stanley', 'Dust', 'Devil', 'Cinematographer', 'Xavi', 'Gimenez', 'done', 'genre', 'best', 'work', 'past', 'decade', 'including', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'last', 'two', 'movies', 'Intacto', 'Jaume', 'Balaguero', 'Darkness', 'only', 'decent', 'thing', 'was', 'Gimenez', 'cinematography', 'could', 'go', 'night', 'was', 'absolutely', 'all-star', 'crew', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'juxtapose', 'crap', 'Dark', 'usually', 'Dark', 'movie', 'head', 'shoulders', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'touched', 'likely', 'anything', 'ever', 'will', 'still', 'something', 'just', 'rubs', 'wrong', 'way', 'do', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'Nacho', 'Cerda', 'film', 'bugs', 'me.But', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'film', 'brought', 'A', 'games', 'table', ""'ve"", 'created', 'something', 'very', 'nice', 'look', 'just', 'lack', 'pieces', 'soul', 'should', 'rights', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'checking', 'out', 'have', 'always', 'avoided', 'Cerda', 'reputation', 'far', 'best', 'starting', 'point', '***']",The Abandoned
653414,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPNE,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","Filmed in Bulgaria by Spanish filmmaker Nacho Cerda, ""The Abandoned"" is a relatively entertaining horror outing with decent atmosphere and a few clever plot twists that lift it above the ordinary.When Marie Jones (Anastasia Hille) was an infant in Russia, her father murdered her mother, but was prevented from simultaneously doing away with Marie and her twin brother, Nicolai, by the quick thinking of the dying woman.  After the event, Marie was adopted and taken to America to live.  Now, forty-some-odd years later, Marie has returned to her long-abandoned home in the wilderness to uncover the truth about her past.  Nicolai, too, has felt compelled to make a return visit to the place, and soon both are confronting their own personal doppelgangers who haunt the homestead and who seem intent on finishing the job their father failed to complete the first time around.Although ""The Abandoned"" suffers from a certain amount of redundancy in its action, the imagery is frequently creepy, the storyline moderately intriguing, and the suspense reasonably well mounted and sustained.

He also just found out his real parents lived at the farm and were murdered. They start seeing dead ghosts of themselves.

Go see it especially with your wife or girlfriend because they will be creeped out.",4,good hardcore horror film,1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,1739,"['really', 'creepy', 'hardcore', 'ghost', 'story', 'movie', 'Forget', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'scary', 'creepy', 'Forget', 'PG-13', '[', 'ghost', 'movies', 'Grudge', 'Boogeyman', 'Messengers', 'Ring', 'etc', 'movie', 'really', 'creepy', 'foreign', 'film', 'Russian', 'foreign', 'film', 'produced', 'Spanish', 'people', 'Don', 'worry', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'Russian', 'actors', 'speak', 'English', 'movie', ""n't"", 'dubbed', 'either', 'movie', 'lady', 'who', 'find', 'real', 'parents', 'adopted', 'was', 'born', 'Russia', 'raised', 'England', 'now', 'America', 'flys', 'Russia', 'visit', 'parents', 'estate', 'deep', 'mountain', 'wilderness', 'Russia', 'out', 'real', 'Russian', 'parents', 'were', 'murdered', 'farm', 'trucker', 'off', 'farmland', 'thats', 'when', 'everything', 'scary', 'Russian', 'guy', 'who', 'there', 'same', 'reasons', 'also', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'real', 'parents', 'lived', 'farm', 'were', 'murdered', 'start', 'seeing', 'dead', 'ghosts', 'house', 'farmland', 'deep', 'woods', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'frighthening', 'fake', 'looking', 'CGI', 'background', 'here', 'ghosts', 'are', 'really', 'scary', 'looking', 'fake', 'corny', 'looking', 'CGI', 'ghosts', 'here', 'lot', 'twists', 'movie', 'movie', 'kinda', 'slow', 'roaming', 'room', 'room', 'checking', 'basement', 'sort', 'thing', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'movie', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'teeny', 'PG-13', 'ghost', 'movie', 'movie', 'rated', 'R.', 'was', 'going', 'see', '2nd', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'theatre', 'so', 'i', 'chickened', 'out', 'how', 'creepy', 'was', 'Go', 'see', 'especially', 'wife', 'girlfriend', 'will', 'be', 'creeped', 'out']",The Abandoned

There are some sketchy issues with the film's basic premise and setup, but if those are put aside, the film does feature a rather dark twisted story, and some pretty edgy acting performances.Marie Jones (Anastasia Hille) is a movie producer who has come to Russia from America to meet with Andrei Masharin (Valentin Ganev), a notary who has informed her that she has inherited a farm, located far out in the country.  The Kaidanovsky property is located on an island in a river which can only be accessed by a bridge.  No one has lived on the farm for over forty years, and Marie hires a man to drive her there.  When they arrive, the driver leaves the truck and vanishes, so Marie eventually makes her way into the farmhouse.  Wandering inside she sees a ghostly figure that looks a lot like her, except soaking wet and with solid white eyeballs.  Terrified, Marie runs out of the house, and ends up falling into the river, and blacking out.  She awakes back in the farmhouse, with a man (Karel Roden) dressed like a soldier, who claims to be her twin brother Nicolai.  He says he is also there because of Masharin.  Although Marie is extremely suspicious, the pair begin to investigate and discover some very strange things, including their own doppelgangers.Things just get more intense, delving back into the past and revealing what happened some forty years ago on the farm, when the siblings were babies, and their parents were still alive.  It's a twisted journey with some very eerie surprises, as Marie struggles to escape her fate.The acting performances are very strong, particularly from Anastasia Hille, who while not unattractive, isn't the raving beauty you often see in these kind of films.  She has maturity and brains, and fits the role of an ordinary person in one hell of a mess.  Maybe things work differently in Russia, but most properties don't sit around idle for forty years.  Of course as soon as Marie arrives, the bridge to the island which has lasted up till then, washes away.While there are some sticky points, the overall story is quite engaging, and the writing generally displays some creativity and some degree of polish.  Also on the plus side, are some effective special effects, and creepy makeup.  If you haven't been grossed out by a pig before, you might be here.  The Abandoned kind of bumps along, until it becomes a full blown supernatural thriller, and once there it generates some real feelings of uncertainly and fear.  Rating: 3.5 stars.",3,"has a few issues, but this creepy thriller set in Russia provides some really scary moments...",1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,2632,"['woman', 'Russia', 'investigate', 'property', 'inherited', 'Abandoned', '2006', 'one', 'films', 'first', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'are', 'sketchy', 'issues', 'film', 'basic', 'premise', 'setup', 'are', 'put', 'aside', 'film', 'feature', 'rather', 'dark', 'twisted', 'story', 'pretty', 'edgy', 'acting', 'performances.Marie', 'Jones', 'Anastasia', 'Hille', 'movie', 'producer', 'who', 'come', 'Russia', 'America', 'meet', 'Andrei', 'Masharin', 'Valentin', 'Ganev', 'notary', 'who', 'informed', 'inherited', 'farm', 'located', 'far', 'out', 'country', 'Kaidanovsky', 'property', 'located', 'island', 'river', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'accessed', 'bridge', 'one', 'lived', 'farm', 'forty', 'years', 'Marie', 'man', 'drive', 'there', 'When', 'arrive', 'driver', 'truck', 'vanishes', 'so', 'Marie', 'eventually', 'way', 'farmhouse', 'Wandering', 'ghostly', 'figure', 'lot', 'soaking', 'wet', 'solid', 'white', 'eyeballs', 'Terrified', 'Marie', 'house', 'up', 'falling', 'river', 'blacking', 'out', 'back', 'farmhouse', 'man', 'Karel', 'Roden', 'dressed', 'soldier', 'who', 'be', 'twin', 'brother', 'Nicolai', 'also', 'there', 'Masharin', 'Marie', 'extremely', 'suspicious', 'pair', 'begin', 'investigate', 'discover', 'very', 'strange', 'things', 'including', 'own', 'doppelgangers.Things', 'just', 'get', 'more', 'intense', 'delving', 'back', 'past', 'revealing', 'what', 'happened', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'farm', 'when', 'siblings', 'were', 'babies', 'parents', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'twisted', 'journey', 'very', 'eerie', 'surprises', 'Marie', 'escape', 'fate.The', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'particularly', 'Anastasia', 'Hille', 'who', 'not', 'unattractive', ""n't"", 'raving', 'beauty', 'often', 'see', 'kind', 'films', 'maturity', 'brains', 'role', 'ordinary', 'person', 'one', 'hell', 'mess', 'Maybe', 'things', 'work', 'differently', 'Russia', 'most', 'properties', 'do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'around', 'idle', 'forty', 'years', 'course', 'as', 'soon', 'Marie', 'bridge', 'island', 'lasted', 'up', 'till', 'then', 'washes', 'are', 'sticky', 'points', 'overall', 'story', 'quite', 'engaging', 'writing', 'generally', 'creativity', 'degree', 'polish', 'Also', 'plus', 'side', 'are', 'effective', 'special', 'effects', 'creepy', 'makeup', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'grossed', 'out', 'pig', 'might', 'be', 'here', 'Abandoned', 'kind', 'bumps', 'full', 'blown', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'once', 'real', 'feelings', 'uncertainly', 'fear', 'Rating', '3.5', 'stars']",The Abandoned

I think that the horror purests didn't like it because it wasn't just a bloody gore fest. It is suspense instead WITHOUT cheap gotcha thrills, or mindless torture. There is a story here, and one that might be too esoteric for the typical horror audience looking for the highest body count. For the American thriller market, who are all about happy, wrap it up in a bow endings, this movie wouldn't work either. It is a thinking, character driven movie that happens to prey upon our most primal reactions to certain places and situations.
