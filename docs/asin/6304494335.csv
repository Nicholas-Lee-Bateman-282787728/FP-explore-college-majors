It was that moving.  I've since seen it with glasses on and it's just as affecting as it was in 1973.  Highest recommendation for folks who like being overwhelmed by an understated teen love story.

But it still manages to hit me in the heart.Great acting and great camera work (using mostly available light) make you enter the hearts of the characters. ""A film with nothing going for it but the people who love it"" says the original trailer from 1973 - and that's true. It's a very simple film but in its simplicity so tender and close that you will never forget the story. It's all about love. It doesn't matter that the material is grainy and some scenes slightly out of focus. It makes you be there with the characters and invites you to take part in their story. No wonder it was the public's choice at the Cannes Film Festival of that year.

Some people will be turned off by the slowness of it, but that's the point. It could have been a four star movie.But then we have strange sub-plots that have nothing to do with the main story, like the idea that the boy can predict the winners of horse races with uncanny accuracy. This is impossible, but if someone could do that, then only a moron wouldn't take advantage of the skill to make money yet the kid doesn't believe in placing any bets. So down to three stars because of dumb stuff like that.And then we look at the quality of the DVD. Grainy and blurry. This is the ugliest looking DVD I've ever seen.

425828,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,6304494335,R. A Rubin,"[9, 9]","I love the 70's for the incredible revolution in film realism.  After a million Doris Day and Debbie Reynolds, 50's gee wiz, let's start a family boosterism, even the teen romance film took a turn to realism.  I must admit that Robby Benson, from distant memory, brings to mind a monkish hairdo and a toothy grin, and the awkwardness of adolescence.  In 1973's Jeremy, I was not disappointed, but actually delighted that the film essentially plays it straight with a couple of star-crossed teen lovebirds.  Contrast Jeremy's sweet, first romance with teen films that came a decade later starting with Fast Times at Ridgeway High or Dazed and Confused.  Can you see the sincerity of Jeremy's romance decline into teen cynicism?  Then in the 90's you get films like She's All That where the main concern is bedding a virgin for a bet. No, I will take Jeremy any time.Benson is derided as gawky, Jewish kitsch.  I must say he did a fine job in this film.  I believe in his first phone call to lovely Glynnis O'Conner and his heroic efforts to be with her always.  She's a little older, more mature.  She appreciates Benson's cello and the romance is on.  Most of the film leads up to the romance, showing a New York, middle class, uptown life style of the 70's. No sooner than the bra strap pops does Glynnis' old man take her away.  Then you get the farewell airport scene. A tear comes to the eye.  It was kind of realistic and eternal.",4,I Believed It,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,1435,"['love', '70', 'incredible', 'revolution', 'film', 'realism', 'million', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', '50', 'gee', 'wiz', 'let', 'start', 'family', 'boosterism', 'even', 'teen', 'romance', 'film', 'took', 'turn', 'realism', 'must', 'admit', 'Robby', 'Benson', 'distant', 'memory', 'mind', 'monkish', 'hairdo', 'toothy', 'grin', 'awkwardness', 'adolescence', '1973', 'Jeremy', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'actually', 'delighted', 'film', 'essentially', 'straight', 'couple', 'star-crossed', 'teen', 'lovebirds', 'Contrast', 'Jeremy', 'sweet', 'first', 'romance', 'teen', 'films', 'came', 'decade', 'later', 'starting', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgeway', 'High', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'Can', 'see', 'sincerity', 'Jeremy', 'romance', 'decline', 'teen', 'cynicism', 'Then', '90', 'get', 'films', 'where', 'main', 'concern', 'bedding', 'virgin', 'bet', 'No', 'will', 'take', 'Jeremy', 'time.Benson', 'derided', 'gawky', 'Jewish', 'kitsch', 'must', 'say', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'film', 'believe', 'first', 'phone', 'call', 'lovely', 'Glynnis', ""O'Conner"", 'heroic', 'efforts', 'be', 'always', 'little', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'Benson', 'cello', 'romance', 'Most', 'film', 'up', 'romance', 'showing', 'New', 'York', 'middle', 'class', 'uptown', 'life', 'style', '70', 'sooner', 'bra', 'strap', 'pops', 'Glynnis', 'old', 'man', 'take', 'away', 'Then', 'get', 'farewell', 'airport', 'scene', 'tear', 'eye', 'was', 'kind', 'realistic', 'eternal']",Jeremy VHS

In 1973 I was 11 and was an extremely shy pre-adolescent who was scared to death of approaching the opposite sex (fear of rejection, looking foolish, etc.).  The actors are very authentic in their portrayal of the awkwardness and power of those feelings being felt for the first time.  This movie really hit home.  The sad movie's ending ripped my heart out and threw me into a two month depression.  I think that speaks to the quality of the acting and storytelling.",5,Very Touching and Well Acted Movie,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,557,"['first', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'back', '1973', 'was', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'again', '1973', 'was', '11', 'was', 'extremely', 'shy', 'pre-adolescent', 'who', 'was', 'scared', 'death', 'approaching', 'opposite', 'sex', 'fear', 'rejection', 'looking', 'foolish', 'etc.', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'authentic', 'portrayal', 'awkwardness', 'power', 'feelings', 'being', 'felt', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'sad', 'movie', 'ending', 'ripped', 'heart', 'threw', 'two', 'month', 'depression', 'think', 'quality', 'acting', 'storytelling']",Jeremy VHS
425832,AW9ERFQZBVCO6,6304494335,The Night Falcon,"[3, 4]","This was not one of the more best made films Benson did, but given his age, it was a good starter for him when you look at his career.  I was as awkward as Jeremy at the age Benson played the role and was more Jeremy when going through my early teens; which is why I loved the movie.  I knew allot of ""nerdy"" wiz kid (brainy) guys and gals who were no different, which is what makes the film worth having in my library.  One of the hardest things for a soul, in my view, who is born into this state; is to work out his or her heart issues with most things intellectually coming easy as they grow and learn, but the matters of the heart coming not so easily.Benson's approach to the subject as a flegling actor is brilliantly played in my view and experience with this mind set. In fact, I think you see more of him, as he really was as a young man in this role; given his own sweet, sensitive nature, which was no acting job as you watched him in all his films. Naturally, if you come from a different background growing up, you can't appreciate his characterization; but I can!  The cinematography of this film is not the best by today's standards, but its a lovely story and a treasure to have of Benson's early works that lead him to stardom during the 1970's, which was my time to be a teenager.Thanks for making this available on Amazon.The DVD case and slip cover came in great condition. Delivery was excellent. No complaints.  Wonderful to have it in my library!PS: I gave this three stars, not to judge the story content, as I think the story is a five star rating given the subject matter.
