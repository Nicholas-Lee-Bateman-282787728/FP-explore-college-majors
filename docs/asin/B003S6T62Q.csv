In horrible picture and sound quality!This thing looks and feels like it was recorded from a really cheap, barely working camcorder. You can get better picture and sound quality from YouTube these days, and this DVD feels really outdated.Joe performs most of his hit songs you'll recognize, the problem is this thing is hard to enjoy due to how hard it is to watch. I honestly get much better mileage just listening to an old CD, or yeah, watching his music videos on YouTube.Do yourself a favor and save your money. One day, hopefully, Joe will release a real DVD with some quality to it and it will be a much better buy than this thing is. I'd have a hard time recommending this even to die hard fans of his.",2,Terrible quality.,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,737,"['Joe', 'live', 'Japan', 'horrible', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'thing', 'feels', 'was', 'recorded', 'really', 'cheap', 'barely', 'working', 'camcorder', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'YouTube', 'days', 'DVD', 'feels', 'really', 'outdated.Joe', 'performs', 'most', 'hit', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'problem', 'thing', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'due', 'how', 'hard', 'watch', 'honestly', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'mileage', 'just', 'listening', 'old', 'CD', 'yeah', 'watching', 'music', 'videos', 'YouTube.Do', 'favor', 'save', 'money', 'One', 'day', 'hopefully', 'Joe', 'will', 'release', 'real', 'DVD', 'quality', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'buy', 'thing', ""'d"", 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'recommending', 'even', 'die', 'hard', 'fans']",Live From Japan

His voice is excellent, his choice of songs is very good, his band is on point, & the audience enjoying the concert is blahh... He is in Japan & either they don't know the music, don't understand the music, or just are not enthusiastic, but Joe put on an excellent show! He sings most of his previous hits, & some of his newer songs from his newest release (at that time).
