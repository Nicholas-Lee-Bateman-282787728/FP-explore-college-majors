However it didn't have quite the amount of extra features that previous DVD sets have had.  I don't know if that is because the distributor has changed or they just didn't have as much material to add to the DVD.  Either way it was a little disappointing in that aspect.,4,Pretty good for a collector,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,350,"['collector/fan', 'Degrassi', 'series', 'course', 'was', 'must', 'have', 'item', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'amount', 'extra', 'features', 'previous', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'had', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'distributor', 'changed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'material', 'add', 'DVD', 'way', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'aspect']",N/A

Sweeney ""GLfootfan""","[4, 6]","This Season of degrassi was so intense and so much better then the other season's and this season was really good because of The dot exploding, and plus Emma and Spinner finding their love together was good too and also some nude involved and a trip to new york in the season final. My favorite part of this season was the movie because it was so much fun to see drama in new york and also the movie was good but kinda unexpected because this was the final season with the four original characters that started the show which are Emma, Manny, Spinner, and Liberty even though Liberty wasn't part of this season, she was in the movie final and it was great to finally close their ending in the show plus Fiona and Declan might do something unexpected too, Anyway this season rocked and I can't wait to see more of Degrassi on my TV.",5,An awesome season,1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,831,"['Season', 'degrassi', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'other', 'season', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'dot', 'exploding', 'Emma', 'Spinner', 'finding', 'love', 'together', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'also', 'nude', 'involved', 'trip', 'new', 'york', 'season', 'final', 'favorite', 'part', 'season', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'see', 'drama', 'new', 'york', 'also', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'kinda', 'unexpected', 'was', 'final', 'season', 'four', 'original', 'characters', 'started', 'show', 'are', 'Emma', 'Manny', 'Spinner', 'Liberty', 'even', 'Liberty', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'season', 'was', 'movie', 'final', 'was', 'great', 'finally', 'close', 'ending', 'show', 'Fiona', 'Declan', 'might', 'do', 'something', 'unexpected', 'too', 'Anyway', 'season', 'rocked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'more', 'Degrassi', 'TV']",N/A

Watch reformed bad boy Peter Stone as he deals with an addiction to crystal meth, the loss of his lovely girlfriend Mia to another continent (*cough* Vampire Diaries *cough*), and the tough decision that his bandmates are forced to make when he goes too far. Watch Riley struggle with his inner feelings and his contrasting jock exterior. Watch Jane toy around with a new relationship, find a friend in an unsuspecting classmate, and pick up a new hobby. Watch the world's most dramatic couple, Sav and Anya, fall in and out...and in and out...and in and out of love again. Watch as little Clare begins to grow into her own, and Alli is as bold as ever. Watch as Holly J, the most hated girl in school, earns both a fresh start and the heart of Degrassi's hottest diplomat kid, Declan Coyne. Watch as alumni favorite Emma Nelson struggles to balance college dreams and her love for helping humankind, and familiar face Marco gains a new role at his alma mater. But most of all, watch as a superb cast of young adults continues to carry the name of Degressi high and proud, never balking to discuss the difficult issues such as homosexuality, drug abuse, religion, and infidelity.
