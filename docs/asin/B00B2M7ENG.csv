In the last few years, it's been a rare movie, save for a really cruddy upload on YouTube, which is an episode of MST3K.If anything, ""The Crawling Hand"" is even sillier, and, to my taste, not as much fun as ""The Slime People"" because it's so talky.

Otherwise, I noticed the picture to be a little unstable in 1-2 spots.  VCI seems to have a problem with layer changes.  About 10 minutes into Slime People, the layer change was VERY noticeable.  Slime People is listed as being made in full screen.  The case says the features are widescreen.  I'm not sure, but it looks like fake widescreen(which is unacceptable)to me.

Again VCI goes all the way with stuff one would not think deserving of the lavish release that this certainly is.The highlight for me was the conversation with Roger Corman and `50s top guru of the genre, Tom Weaver. Tom has been interviewing people since forever, it seems, and he knows exactly how and what to ask his interviewee in order to get all the facts down for the history books. His conversation here with Susan Hart is a perfect example of a ""Weaver-talk"" that comes off absolutely cozy and informative.Thank you VCI! I only wish that ALL vintage Horror-Sci Fi-Fantasy films could have the coverage that these two admittedly minor but schlockingly fun films are given here. There are a handful of commentators who are worth the purchase of a DVD no matter what film is contained therein. Mr. Weaver is right at the top of these select few. Please, VCI, keep this guy busy!Also see Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 1 with THE MONSTER FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR and SERPENT ISLAND.

1621255,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B00B2M7ENG,Terry Sunday,"[29, 30]","Whatever your expectations of ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 2,"" mine were probably lower. I had never before seen either of these shoestring-budget, 1960's-vintage, black-and-white films, and I had no idea how they measured up (or down) to the already low standards of the genre. Based on the garish lobby-card artwork on the front of the DVD case, though, I felt sure they would be, at best, forgettable schlockfests, or, at worst, a total waste of time and money.Imagine my surprise, then, when I watched the two movies in this double feature (both are on a single DVD that appears to be pressed, not burned-to-order) in one sitting and enjoyed them both very much. Oh, there's no way anyone could call these ""good"" movies, not by any stretch of the imagination. But they're really not bad at all, given their limitations of budget, talent and special effects. These types of films tend to show up as blurry, washed-out, jerky, late-late-late-night offerings on obscure television channels, with 10 minutes of commercials for every four or five minutes of movie. The transfers of ""The Crawling Hand"" and ""The Slime People"" on this DVD are so crisp and sharp that the movies look better than they are. Kudos to VCI Entertainment for either finding excellent source material or for doing some good restoration. The plots aren't bad, either. Both movies are logically consistent based on their initial premises (the same can't be said for many modern films). The sound tracks are also fine. The dialogue is clear and precise, and the unobtrusive music doesn't drown out the actors' voices. Included on the DVD are two trailers and a 55-minute audio-only interview with actress Susan Hart by sci-fi film expert Tom Weaver that provides fascinating details and remembrances about making ""The Slime People."" How rare is it for a cheap DVD such as this one to have decent special features?I really enjoy discovering old sci-fi movies that I've never seen before. Some of them, like ""Beyond the Time Barrier,"" are so bad that I watch them once and then donate them to the library. Others I hang onto because I'm sure I'll want to watch them again in the future. ""Creepy Creature Double Feature Vol. 2"" is one of the latter, and it has a permanent place on my media shelf. My five-star review is not for the movies themselves, of course. Rather, it reflects the fact that you get these two pretty-good films in a quality DVD package for a mere pittance. Overall, it's definitely a five-star value.",5,Not Bad at All--Seriously!!!,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,2497,"['expectations', 'Creepy', 'Creature', 'Double', 'Feature', 'Vol', '2', 'mine', 'were', 'probably', 'lower', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'either', 'shoestring-budget', ""1960's-vintage"", 'black-and-white', 'films', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'measured', 'up', 'down', 'already', 'low', 'standards', 'genre', 'Based', 'garish', 'lobby-card', 'artwork', 'front', 'DVD', 'case', 'felt', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'forgettable', 'schlockfests', 'worst', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'money.Imagine', 'surprise', 'then', 'when', 'watched', 'two', 'movies', 'double', 'feature', 'are', 'single', 'DVD', 'be', 'pressed', 'not', 'burned-to-order', 'one', 'sitting', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'Oh', 'way', 'anyone', 'could', 'call', 'good', 'movies', 'not', 'stretch', 'imagination', ""'re"", 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'given', 'limitations', 'budget', 'talent', 'special', 'effects', 'types', 'films', 'tend', 'show', 'up', 'blurry', 'washed-out', 'jerky', 'late-late-late-night', 'offerings', 'obscure', 'television', 'channels', '10', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'four', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'transfers', 'Crawling', 'Hand', 'Slime', 'People', 'DVD', 'are', 'so', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'movies', 'look', 'better', 'are', 'Kudos', 'VCI', 'Entertainment', 'finding', 'excellent', 'source', 'material', 'doing', 'good', 'restoration', 'plots', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'movies', 'are', 'logically', 'consistent', 'based', 'initial', 'premises', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'many', 'modern', 'films', 'sound', 'tracks', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'precise', 'unobtrusive', 'music', ""n't"", 'drown', 'out', 'actors', 'voices', 'Included', 'DVD', 'are', 'two', 'trailers', '55-minute', 'audio-only', 'interview', 'actress', 'Susan', 'Hart', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'expert', 'Tom', 'Weaver', 'fascinating', 'details', 'remembrances', 'making', 'Slime', 'People', 'How', 'rare', 'cheap', 'DVD', 'such', 'one', 'have', 'decent', 'special', 'features', 'really', 'enjoy', 'discovering', 'old', 'sci-fi', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Time', 'Barrier', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'watch', 'once', 'then', 'donate', 'library', 'Others', 'hang', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'future', 'Creepy', 'Creature', 'Double', 'Feature', 'Vol', '2', 'one', 'latter', 'permanent', 'place', 'media', 'shelf', 'five-star', 'review', 'not', 'movies', 'course', 'Rather', 'fact', 'get', 'two', 'pretty-good', 'films', 'quality', 'DVD', 'package', 'mere', 'pittance', 'Overall', 'definitely', 'five-star', 'value']",Creepy Creatures Vol. 2: Crawling Hand/the Slime People
