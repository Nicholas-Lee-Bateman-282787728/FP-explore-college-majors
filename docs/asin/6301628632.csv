The first half of the movie concerns her life in Moab and in the movie she was a priestess of the God Chemosh, a pagan God who demanded the sacrifice of young women to keep him happy. Ruth was to be sacrificed, but what spared when an blemish appeared on her skin. This will play out later in the film.She meets a young Jew and becomes very interested in him and this leads her to eventually leave Moab and marry him. He dies and instead of going back to Moab decides to accompany her mother-in-law back to the land of her birth. When she gets there she is treated with disdain for being a Moabitess, even though she's embraced the Jewish faith.She meets Boaz and their complicated relationship begins. The ending is already known to those who know the story, but the movie is a very nice one to watch the dramatization of the well known, but not told often enough story of Ruth, the woman whose line would eventually lead to Jesus.I think this story is a very important one because of the content it contains.

When she mets a goldsmith, the Jewish slave Mahlon ( Tom Tryon, who stars in The Cardinal ), she is deeply affected because his religion do not require human sacrifices, so she embraces the Ten Commandements and the Jewish laws. Then Ruth and her fianc&eacute; Mahlon are pursued by the King of Moab. Ruth knows Naomi ( Peggy Wood ), Mahlon's mother, and marries him but he is killed by the Moabites. Ruth and Naomi must run away from Moab, nowadays Jordan, going to Judea, and a true and deep friendship based on mutual trust joins both women. Later in Judea big problems arise when people know about Ruth's past and she is accused of idolatry. Two men, Boaz ( Stuart Whitman ), a bit rude but noble and the self-seeking Tob ( Jeff Morrow ) help both women and begin a competition to conquer Ruth's love. Ruth goes to court to prove that her Jewish beliefs are true. The trial is brief and it is stunning how easily things change due to Ruth's witty remarks. The final contest, between Boaz and Tom to marry Ruth, is as bright as the trial, and now Naomi suggest to Ruth the brilliant idea to marry the one she likes though he has less law rights to marry her than the other one.King David and Jesus were Ruth's descendants.

Well, make your own judgement as I did. As for the frequent complaint that the movie doesn't follow the actual Book Of Ruth, let's face it--an average reader can read the book in about 15 minutes or less and there is not that much expository nature to it.  I thought it was pretty darn creative the way they filled out the story to make it more interesting and add depth to the characters. The movie is a fine example of the 50's style biblical epics, the DVD transfer is okay, and there are few extremely short but nifty newsreels about the film and its premiere.

They made it into an exciting ""action"" movie all to itself, but it had nothing to do with the original story in the Bible.Personally, I feel that the Biblical story was interesting enough without making it into something entirely different. However, even that can be done badly. I watched another DVD that was probably about as accurate as a movie can be, but they did such a terrible job on that one that they took all the passion out of it.

259087,ADES8B01WRPI3,6301628632,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[16, 24]","THE STORY OF RUTH is the telling of the story of Ruth, the grandmother of King David (versus Goliath, etc.) and an ancestor of Jesus Christ Himself. Unfortunately, the film ends up being a very badly missed opportunity to make a great Bible movie, but it fails miserably by missing the overall message despite its attention to other Bible verses and historical details!The cast, costumes, and sets are all great. The problem is the writing. They spend the first hour making up a non-Biblical origin for Ruth, as an orphaned  girl sold to the Cult of Chemosh in Moab. She grows to adulthood as a priestess in a cult that sacrifices a child to a stone statue annually.The movie introduces many characters named in the Bible's book of Ruth. Naomi is the mother of Mahlon. Mahlon is a statue artisan who repairs Chemosh statues even though he is repelled by the concept of child sacrifice. Ruth learns about the God of Israel from the Israelite named Mahlon, and they marry, sort of, after an hour's worth of dramatic plot twists which all have NOTHING to do with the Bible story of Ruth. MAYBE it all could have been a reasonable setup for Ruth's origin, if only the second hour would have FINALLY brought out the correct Bible story.Instead, the second hour is re-written so that Boaz has a modern, romantic tension between himself and Ruth, while Ruth is being courted by her legal next-of-kin. In the Bible, this unnamed next-of-kin wants Ruth, but quickly declines when Boaz reminds him that he will be raising a heritage for the deceased Mahlon. Ruth and Boaz finally end up right, but the story inbetween is foolishly re-written, so this movie ultimately fails as a Bible story retelling.A major element in the second hour is that Ruth is accused of being an idolator, a former priestess of Chemosh, and the people protest for her death sentence.The film has lots of small Bible verses portrayed correctly, but it totally screws up the major story arc. They show the scene and dialogue when Ruth decides to join Naomi to return to her homeland, and Naomi's God will be Ruth's God, etc. They also show other details, like exchanging sandals as part of a business deal, which is in the Bible, and one of my favorite amusing, ancient cultural moments in scripture. The movie has many of the pieces but the puzzle is not put together to resemble the Bible story, not nearly enough.It is strange that the film makers seemed to have done their homework so well concerning the culture of the Moabites who worship Chemosh, but then they screw up the SIMPLE story of Ruth from the actual Bible, which is the name of the darn movie in the first place!There is a much better RUTH story on DVD, which is an animated claymation 30 minute story, but is TOTALLY accurate to the Bible! TESTAMENT: THE BIBLE IN ANIMATION - RUTH, (1996). This animated version of Ruth is super cute as well as super faithful to the actual Bible story and details. This animated DVD is excellent and worth your time and money. If you like the cute claymation style of RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER and THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY Chrismas classics, then you will LOVE this animated RUTH DVD! Get that instead!THE STORY OF RUTH, this DVD, is only of interest to the most hardcore Bible DVD collector, who needs to have it on their DVD shelf.

Peggy Wood's many scenes of emotional upheaval are instances of excellent screen acting.The Moabite scenes are crazy, as is all of that Chemosh stuff, but this film has great appeal...for die hards only, and especially for cinemascope afficionados of yore who can re-imagine it all even on the tiny screens we must put up with now, TV and movie alike.

This film develops during the times when due to famine in Bethlehem, a family is forced to move to Moab, a nearby country where the people do not hold the same beliefs and idolatrize a man made god.The family is formed by Elimelech, his wife Naomi and their two sons Mahlon and Chilion; who upon arrival at Moab, open a small business working as artisans for the ruling class.  While they are Jews, both sons end up marrying Moabite women: Chilion marries Orpah and Mahlon marries Ruth.As a child, Ruth was exchanged for money by poor parents who were struggling to survive hard times. The Moab priest takes Ruth in and brings her up as a candidate to priestess. Ruth is then selected as a child to be sacrificed to the Moab god, but she develops a rash at the moment of selection, which strangely enough, disappears once her life is spared.Is it an omen?Has some power beyond her understanding protected her life?Does she have a special purpose?She meets Mahlon when he is involved in the design and production of the crown of a child about to be immolated. Mahlon is taken by Ruth beauty and he begins to share his beliefs, specifically that life is too precious to be sacrificed to a god, made out of stone, that needed repair and he was chosen to do the job.If a god is just a figure that we can actually touch, breaks and we need to repair, what kind of God is that?He then tells Ruth that the belief of his people is that God is all mighty, that he is invisible, that he created and protects all life, that he is all merciful and would never accept the punishment of sacrifice, letting a young life come to an end so others can prosper.Ruth begins to question the teachings she has received in preparation for total purification as a priestess of the Moabs and she even learns the ten commandments, given to her in a carved stone that Mahlon has worked on as a gift of love.When she questions the priest that took her in, and cries out to stop the sacrifice of the child, the soldiers go to the house of Naomi and kill her husband and ultimately, her two sons.Naomi decides to return to Bethlehem and Ruth, now married to Mahlon, feels she must follow and support her mother in law's decision. A tender moment takes place and we hear the words of Ruth who tells her mother in law that she shall follow and go wherever Naomi chooses to travel to. She then says: ""your people shall be my people and your God shall be my God!""The two women return to Bethlehem and here is where the plot evolves to explain to us the great importance of Ruth in biblical terms.

This film shows how difficult it is for pagans to imagine an Invisible God, although they paradoxically believe that their idols hear them even when they are too physically distant to be in the line of sight of them. This shows the inconsistency of their thinking, and helps them think of an Invisible God.Pagans assign different gods to different roles. It is thus difficult for pagans to even imagine a Single God who is simultaneously responsible for the origin of the sun, moon, all of us, and the very ground we walk on.The viewer can comprehend why the Bible condemns pagan religions as abominations. If anything, the film understates the odious nature of child sacrifice to gods. The little girl to be sacrificed is shown about to be stabbed to death first.

There are two ways to look at this movie: Scripturally and story-wise.Scripturally the movie is not that good. There is a lot of license with Scripture (not surprising considering how small the book of Ruth is). But the license isn't really congruent with revelation. For example, this movie makes Ruth out to be a high priestess of chemosh and married for about 1/2 second to a Jewish man just before he dies. Boaz is a bitter man who makes a Moabite man drink poisoned water. The roles of kinsmen-redeemer is not even close to accurately portrayed. These things were done to try to make the movie have additional action, but detracts from the very real story. Also, here Naomi does not change her name, Moab tries to track Ruth down and kill her, and so on and so forth.From a story perspective, the story is your classic structure. Boy meets girl, girl is coy, boy gets into trouble, girl rescues, boy says sappy stuff, girl falls in love, boy dies, girl moves on, girl meets new man, girl marries new man. And the actors do a good job with this standard plot line. For a movie made 41 years ago, it's still enjoyable watching. The production is pretty good and the acting is good. The sets remind you of Ben-Hur.

Eventhough, parts of this movie is NOT in the Bible, there are still some parts of it that ARE, in the Bible! And I still love this classic old movie ,about Ruth! I highly recommend this movie!This movie is about a pretty little girl named Ruth, who was solded by her father, to become trained to live in a pagan temple,that worships stone idols,and Ruth may even attain, the so called high honor of being killed for this idol of stone, in  Moab.  While Ruth grows up in this temple, she has become a very beautiful woman, and she catches the eye of a very handsome man, named Mahlon who is a good man ,who believes in the only one true GOD, the God of Abraham!Mahlon and his father and brother, all worked with carvings in gold, and stone. Mahlon and his brother and father, was assigned to make a crown of gold for the pagan temple, and Mahlon carried it to the temple, and was tolded to give it to Ruth. Ruth learns that Mahlon, does not believe in stone idols, and that he only believes in the one true God, and Ruth wants to learn more about Mahlon's  one true God, and asks Mahlon to meet with her in secret! And Mahlon and Ruth fall in love, and Ruth starts doubting the pagan temple's teachings, about the stone idol, especially after Mahlon tells her, that he has helped make repairs to this so called stone god, that Ruth thought was protecting her. When the pagan temple priests, and the king of Moab, find out about Ruth and Mahlon, their life is changed forever!Ruth ends up becoming a widow, and goes with Naomi, her mother in law to Judea, to start a new life, and Ruth wants to go where Naomi goes, and she now ,truly believes in Mahlon's one true God, the God of Abraham, and Moses. Naomi and Ruth are now widowers, and they have the right to glean for food ,in the fields of Judea. When Naomi's handsome kinsman, Boaz sees Ruth ,the beautiful widow from Moab, gleaning in his fields, their life is again, changed forever!PLEASE also READ, the BOOK OF RUTH, that is in the HOLY BIBLE, and get GOD'S TRUE account, of this amazing story of so long ago! I have always found hope, in that God helps Ruth, get a second chance at love! She was also very lucky, in having a good mother in law, and Ruth was a very special woman, who had great courage, and she got a second chance, to have a new beginning at life, with Boaz! And from their lineage would later come KING DAVID, AND JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR, WHO IS THE SON OF GOD!",5,BOAZ NOTICES RUTH GLEANING IN HIS FIELDS!,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,2556,"['loved', 'movie', 'Book', 'Ruth', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'bible', 'Eventhough', 'parts', 'movie', 'NOT', 'Bible', 'are', 'still', 'parts', 'ARE', 'Bible', 'still', 'love', 'classic', 'old', 'movie', 'Ruth', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'movie', 'pretty', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Ruth', 'who', 'was', 'solded', 'father', 'become', 'trained', 'live', 'pagan', 'temple', 'stone', 'idols', 'Ruth', 'may', 'even', 'attain', 'so', 'called', 'high', 'honor', 'being', 'killed', 'idol', 'stone', 'Moab', 'Ruth', 'up', 'temple', 'become', 'very', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'eye', 'very', 'handsome', 'man', 'named', 'Mahlon', 'who', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'true', 'GOD', 'God', 'Abraham', 'Mahlon', 'father', 'brother', 'worked', 'carvings', 'gold', 'stone', 'Mahlon', 'brother', 'father', 'was', 'assigned', 'make', 'crown', 'gold', 'pagan', 'temple', 'Mahlon', 'carried', 'temple', 'was', 'tolded', 'give', 'Ruth', 'Ruth', 'Mahlon', 'not', 'believe', 'stone', 'idols', 'only', 'one', 'true', 'God', 'Ruth', 'learn', 'more', 'Mahlon', 'one', 'true', 'God', 'Mahlon', 'meet', 'secret', 'Mahlon', 'Ruth', 'fall', 'love', 'Ruth', 'doubting', 'pagan', 'temple', 'teachings', 'stone', 'idol', 'especially', 'Mahlon', 'helped', 'make', 'repairs', 'so', 'called', 'stone', 'god', 'Ruth', 'thought', 'was', 'protecting', 'When', 'pagan', 'temple', 'priests', 'king', 'Moab', 'find', 'out', 'Ruth', 'Mahlon', 'life', 'changed', 'forever', 'Ruth', 'up', 'becoming', 'widow', 'Naomi', 'mother', 'law', 'Judea', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'Ruth', 'go', 'where', 'Naomi', 'now', 'truly', 'Mahlon', 'one', 'true', 'God', 'God', 'Abraham', 'Moses', 'Naomi', 'Ruth', 'are', 'now', 'widowers', 'have', 'right', 'glean', 'food', 'fields', 'Judea', 'When', 'Naomi', 'handsome', 'kinsman', 'Boaz', 'Ruth', 'beautiful', 'widow', 'Moab', 'gleaning', 'fields', 'life', 'again', 'changed', 'forever', 'PLEASE', 'also', 'READ', 'BOOK', 'OF', 'RUTH', 'HOLY', 'BIBLE', 'get', 'GOD', 'TRUE', 'account', 'amazing', 'story', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'hope', 'God', 'Ruth', 'get', 'second', 'chance', 'love', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'lucky', 'having', 'good', 'mother', 'law', 'Ruth', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'great', 'courage', 'got', 'second', 'chance', 'have', 'new', 'beginning', 'life', 'Boaz', 'lineage', 'would', 'later', 'come', 'KING', 'DAVID', 'AND', 'JESUS', 'CHRIST', 'OUR', 'SAVIOR', 'WHO', 'THE', 'SON', 'OF', 'GOD']",N/A

Score by Franz Waxman.Starring Elana Eden(as Ruth), Stuart Whitman, Tom Tyron, VivecaLindfors, Thayer David, Les Tremayne, Eduard Franz, John Banner, VictorBuono, I. Stanford Jolley and Jeff Morrow.An expansion and elaboration of the life of Ruth--a Moabite and paganwoman--who realizing the evil, falsity and nihilism of idolatry andchild immolation--comes to realize that the Jews who live across theJordan river in the town of Bethlehem worship the one true God. Aftermany obstacles, she will eventually marry a prominent and decent Hebrewand so lay the foundation for a line that will eventually produce KingDavid, the first royal house of Israel and, a thousand years later, TheChrist.A genuinely superb, intelligent, well directed and acted late entryHollywood epic that has been mostly and unjustly neglected and, yet, isas good as any made in the previous decade. While, as indicated,elements have been added, these serve primarily to allow the film todramatize for the audience not only Judaism at this time and thecustoms of the people---and fairly accurately as well---but in anengaging manner the debased death loving pagan culture of Moab, itsworship of the stone idol Chemosh and its revolting practice of childsacrifice and immolation.Of the generally fine cast, Whitman, Lindfors, David(as the High Priestof Chemosh) and especially Morrow as the conniving Tob are highlights.To discover such a film is to make one realize the literacy,intelligence and ambitious standards that has almost been completelyforfeited in the modern film. Not to mention the refreshing lack ofanti-Christian/semetic bigotry.Highly recommended.The film industry before the Code was destroyed and the Left turned Hollywood into Moscow West used to be at such a height of accepted artistic brilliance and standards that four different studios working on four different films could end up producing a highly credible unintended film series concerning the history of the House of David and Pre-Babylon Israel.Thus this film serves as a fine prologue(think THEPHANTOM MENACE) for the following film trilogy which you might wish to follow my reviews for.SAUL AND DAVID(1964)DAVID AND BATHSHEBA (1951)SOLOMON AND SHEBA (1959)",5,THE SAGA BEGINS........,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,2304,"['STORY', 'OF', 'RUTH', '1960', 'Directed', 'Henry', 'Koster', 'Script', 'NormanCorwin', 'Make', 'up', 'Ben', 'Nye', 'Score', 'Franz', 'Waxman.Starring', 'Elana', 'Eden', 'Ruth', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'Tom', 'Tyron', 'VivecaLindfors', 'Thayer', 'David', 'Les', 'Tremayne', 'Eduard', 'Franz', 'John', 'Banner', 'VictorBuono', 'I.', 'Stanford', 'Jolley', 'Jeff', 'Morrow.An', 'expansion', 'elaboration', 'life', 'Ruth', 'Moabite', 'paganwoman', 'who', 'realizing', 'evil', 'falsity', 'nihilism', 'idolatry', 'andchild', 'immolation', 'realize', 'Jews', 'who', 'live', 'theJordan', 'river', 'town', 'Bethlehem', 'worship', 'one', 'true', 'God', 'Aftermany', 'obstacles', 'will', 'eventually', 'marry', 'prominent', 'decent', 'Hebrewand', 'so', 'lay', 'foundation', 'line', 'will', 'eventually', 'produce', 'KingDavid', 'first', 'royal', 'house', 'Israel', 'thousand', 'years', 'later', 'TheChrist.A', 'genuinely', 'superb', 'intelligent', 'well', 'directed', 'acted', 'late', 'entryHollywood', 'epic', 'been', 'mostly', 'unjustly', 'neglected', 'yet', 'isas', 'good', 'made', 'previous', 'decade', 'indicated', 'elements', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'serve', 'primarily', 'allow', 'film', 'todramatize', 'audience', 'not', 'only', 'Judaism', 'time', 'thecustoms', 'people', '-and', 'fairly', 'accurately', 'as', 'well', '-but', 'anengaging', 'manner', 'debased', 'death', 'loving', 'pagan', 'culture', 'Moab', 'itsworship', 'stone', 'idol', 'Chemosh', 'revolting', 'practice', 'childsacrifice', 'immolation.Of', 'generally', 'fine', 'cast', 'Whitman', 'Lindfors', 'David', 'High', 'Priestof', 'Chemosh', 'especially', 'Morrow', 'conniving', 'Tob', 'are', 'highlights.To', 'discover', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'realize', 'literacy', 'intelligence', 'ambitious', 'standards', 'almost', 'been', 'completelyforfeited', 'modern', 'film', 'Not', 'mention', 'refreshing', 'lack', 'ofanti-Christian/semetic', 'bigotry.Highly', 'recommended.The', 'film', 'industry', 'Code', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Left', 'turned', 'Hollywood', 'Moscow', 'West', 'used', 'be', 'such', 'height', 'accepted', 'artistic', 'brilliance', 'standards', 'four', 'different', 'studios', 'working', 'four', 'different', 'films', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'producing', 'highly', 'credible', 'unintended', 'film', 'series', 'concerning', 'history', 'House', 'David', 'Pre-Babylon', 'Israel.Thus', 'film', 'fine', 'prologue', 'think', 'THEPHANTOM', 'MENACE', 'following', 'film', 'trilogy', 'might', 'wish', 'follow', 'reviews', 'for.SAUL', 'AND', 'DAVID', '1964', 'DAVID', 'AND', 'BATHSHEBA', '1951', 'SOLOMON', 'AND', 'SHEBA', '1959']",N/A

It's not hard to see why: despite an intelligent script by Norman Corwin, it's a bit on the dull side and tends to drag its feet at times. Strangely, it's the scenes in pagan Moab that are the least effective, for all the promise of human sacrifice and slave pits, though Tom Tryon does offer the film's strongest performance in that section. Just as strangely, despite being a last-minute replacement for Stephen Boyd and looking like he won the part in a miscasting competition, Stuart Whitman is surprisingly good as Boaz in the more enjoyable, though distinctly soap-operish second half in Judea. Sadly, Elena Eden is little more than adequate at best in the title role, and at her worst makes a pig's ear of the Song of Ruth. No complaints about Franz Waxman's score, however, which has a simple sincerity that carries the film along without overpowering it.Fox's DVD boasts a very good widescreen transfer that, due to the limitations of the early CinemaScope lenses, is better in medium shots than crowd scenes, although the stereo tracks have not aged as well as they could.
