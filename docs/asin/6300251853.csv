230139,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,6300251853,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[3, 3]","Disclaimer: The version of the film that I watched was included in theBig Screen Bombshells Collection, and as such, I cannot comment on the quality of the DVD package offered here.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.Jayne Mansfield, in her last screen role, is the central figure in this determined-to-emote screen adaptation of Gerald Sandford's play, a sketch-work examination of love and morals in late sixties New York.  Full of weighted movements and freighted relationships, Ms. Mansfield tries her hand at three incarnations of the same woman - Johnnie, a young, soon-to-be abandoned bride; Mae, a girl alone and in trouble; and Eileen, a street walker who has lost touch with reality - and it's her story that loops its way through the lives of the rest of the residents in her New York walk-up.  Tying the narrative together is Pops, the building manager, who tells Johnnie/Mae/Eileen's story as a warning to another young woman, one who is desperate to get away from the guiding influence of her immigrant mother - but not yet experienced enough to know what she might be getting into.Good intentions pave the way for this particular hour-and-a-half road to hell.  First time director Matt Cimber (credited with his real name of Matteo Ottaviano) obviously tried to turn in an earnest effort, and the film was well-photographed by L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kov&aacute;cs - even Ms. Mansfield was credible if not  entirely convincing in her role.  But it's the melodramatic style of the production that ends up being squirm-inducing - anyone who has seen the Coens eviscerate this kind of phoney drama in 'Barton Fink' will immediately pick up on its presence in 'Single Room Furnished'.  Perhaps this sort of tripe resonates on the stage, but it's painful to watch as filmed.There is one startling image in this film, though, one that I still have in my head days later.  It's a simple scene with no dialog, and only lasts for a few seconds, but is repeated right before the closing credits - Ms. Mansfield, in her street-walker persona, is leaving the bar she frequents and is walking home under the streetlamps past shops closed for the evening.  The scene is shot from across the street, and there is something intangible about this attractive woman staring into the shop windows and walking under the night's lights that suggests an atmosphere of aching loneliness that the rest of the film desperately aspires to but, except for this brief scene, never achieves.  This bit of cinematic excellence is small payback for sitting through the rest of the film, but I'm glad I saw it - although it doesn't amount to enough to recommend the entire picture for what amounts to probably less than ten seconds of screen time.Doubtless there are some viewers who will still appreciate this film, despite what I consider it's overarching, portentous dialog and ham-fisted situations.  From a technical standpoint, it matches up well with other films from the 'Hollywood as Royalty' era of the late sixties and earlier, and those films certainly have their fans.  Unfortunately, its serious demeanor looks ridiculous today, despite some decent performances by Debra Keller and Fabian Dean in a subplot as later-in-life lovers, and the film comes across almost like a caricature of Arthur Miller or Eugene O'Neill - or else it's a spot-on imitation of those playwrights.  I suppose it depends on what sort of esteem you hold O'Neill and Miller.The audio and picture contained in the 'Bombshells' box set is actually quite nice - an anamorphic widescreen transfer with little or no defects in the print, or at least none that I noticed on one viewing.  This OOP Rhino version is listed at a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, nor does imdb list any extras for this package, so for those who are interested in this film, it may pay to compare prices with Mill Creek's 'Bombshell' collection.",2,Blech,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,3907,"['Disclaimer', 'version', 'film', 'watched', 'was', 'included', 'theBig', 'Screen', 'Bombshells', 'Collection', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'quality', 'DVD', 'package', 'offered', 'here', 'My', 'review', 'concerned', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'only.Jayne', 'Mansfield', 'last', 'screen', 'role', 'central', 'figure', 'determined-to-emote', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Gerald', 'Sandford', 'play', 'sketch-work', 'examination', 'love', 'morals', 'late', 'sixties', 'New', 'York', 'Full', 'weighted', 'movements', 'freighted', 'relationships', 'Ms.', 'Mansfield', 'hand', 'three', 'incarnations', 'same', 'woman', 'Johnnie', 'young', 'soon-to-be', 'abandoned', 'bride', 'Mae', 'girl', 'alone', 'trouble', 'Eileen', 'street', 'walker', 'who', 'lost', 'touch', 'reality', 'story', 'way', 'lives', 'rest', 'residents', 'New', 'York', 'walk-up', 'Tying', 'narrative', 'together', 'Pops', 'building', 'manager', 'who', 'Johnnie/Mae/Eileen', 'story', 'warning', 'young', 'woman', 'one', 'who', 'desperate', 'get', 'away', 'guiding', 'influence', 'immigrant', 'mother', 'not', 'yet', 'experienced', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'getting', 'into.Good', 'intentions', 'pave', 'way', 'particular', 'hour-and-a-half', 'road', 'hell', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'Matt', 'Cimber', 'credited', 'real', 'name', 'Matteo', 'Ottaviano', 'obviously', 'tried', 'turn', 'earnest', 'effort', 'film', 'was', 'well-photographed', 'L', 'aacute', 'oacute', 'Kov', 'aacute', 'cs', 'even', 'Ms.', 'Mansfield', 'was', 'credible', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'role', 'melodramatic', 'style', 'production', 'up', 'being', 'squirm-inducing', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Coens', 'eviscerate', 'kind', 'phoney', 'drama', ""'Barton"", 'Fink', 'will', 'immediately', 'pick', 'up', 'presence', ""'Single"", 'Room', 'Furnished', 'Perhaps', 'sort', 'tripe', 'resonates', 'stage', 'painful', 'watch', 'filmed.There', 'one', 'startling', 'image', 'film', 'though', 'one', 'still', 'have', 'head', 'days', 'later', 'simple', 'scene', 'dialog', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'repeated', 'right', 'closing', 'credits', 'Ms.', 'Mansfield', 'street-walker', 'persona', 'leaving', 'bar', 'frequents', 'walking', 'home', 'streetlamps', 'shops', 'closed', 'evening', 'scene', 'shot', 'street', 'something', 'intangible', 'attractive', 'woman', 'staring', 'shop', 'walking', 'night', 'lights', 'atmosphere', 'aching', 'loneliness', 'rest', 'film', 'desperately', 'brief', 'scene', 'never', 'bit', 'cinematic', 'excellence', 'small', 'payback', 'sitting', 'rest', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', ""n't"", 'amount', 'enough', 'recommend', 'entire', 'picture', 'what', 'amounts', 'probably', 'less', 'ten', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time.Doubtless', 'are', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'still', 'appreciate', 'film', 'what', 'consider', 'overarching', 'portentous', 'dialog', 'ham-fisted', 'situations', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'up', 'well', 'other', 'films', ""'Hollywood"", 'Royalty', 'era', 'late', 'sixties', 'earlier', 'films', 'certainly', 'have', 'fans', 'Unfortunately', 'serious', 'demeanor', 'ridiculous', 'today', 'decent', 'performances', 'Debra', 'Keller', 'Fabian', 'Dean', 'subplot', 'later-in-life', 'lovers', 'film', 'almost', 'caricature', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'else', 'spot-on', 'imitation', 'playwrights', 'suppose', 'what', 'sort', 'esteem', 'hold', ""O'Neill"", 'Miller.The', 'audio', 'picture', 'contained', ""'Bombshells"", 'box', 'set', 'actually', 'quite', 'nice', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'little', 'defects', 'print', 'least', 'none', 'noticed', 'one', 'viewing', 'OOP', 'Rhino', 'version', 'listed', '1.33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'imdb', 'list', 'extras', 'package', 'so', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'film', 'may', 'pay', 'compare', 'prices', 'Mill', 'Creek', ""'Bombshell"", 'collection']",Single Room Furnished VHS

There are strange echoes here. Also, if I recall the last scene when she walks away away at night, I just felt it had a poignancy. Jayne walking away in this film looks like it happened yesterday.

MONKEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY'.I have watched that scene about 50 times,finding it so powerful,and fierce !.The cheapness of the sets make the film look like a play,which is good thing(All the scenes with Jayne,basically).Also as one reviewer stated the quality of this DVD is much better than the lower quality VHS that i also have watched.Conclusion:Jayne was NEVER an actress,but a personality.She played herself in every movie she appeared,but this time she is fed up with the Battle to be the 'Super-Monroe' that she was groomed to be,and it is an appropriate ''LAST FILM''.So to non-fans of Jayne,it is an awful movie,but  to her loyal fans,it is almost an autobiographical statement of how she really felt at the end of her sad life.Very sad",5,Jayne Mansfield's Last movie was an Art Film !,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,2280,"['watching', 'about', '20', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'Jayne', 'Mansfield', 'fan', '1977', 'i', 'have', 'studied', 'enough', 'make', 'claim', 'opinion', 'Art-Film.First', 'great', 'credits', 'music.The', 'Walter', 'Winchell', 'introduction', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'eery', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'Ed', 'Wood', ""Glenda'.The"", 'film', 'VERY', 'obviously', 'puzzle', 'pieced', 'together', 'make', 'movie', 'fast', 'buck', 'last', 'husband', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'courage', 'put', 'real', 'name', 'credits', 'would', 'have', 'sense', 'Jayne', 'had', 'not', 'finished', 'scenes.However', 'surprisingly', 'coherent', 'even', 'subplot', '2', 'loser-lovers', 'finding', 'love', 'up', 'sounding', 'preachy', 'moralistic', 'compared', 'mess', 'Jayne', 'character', 'made', 'life.It', 'couple', 'viewing', 'movie', 'get', 'cheap', 'sets', 'horrible', 'wigs', 'mostly', 'first', 'AND', 'second', 'Jayne', 'find', 'first', 'part', 'when', 'see', 'Jayne', 'very', 'average.The', 'second', 'part', 'when', 'family', 'way', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'also', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'way', 'BEST', 'last', 'scene', 'sailor.Miss', 'Thing', 'was', 'bitter', 'there', 'real', 'bitter', 'little', 'finger', 'years', 'research', 'lead', 'think', 'was', 'REAL', 'Jayne', 'speaking', 'there', 'was', '1966', 'year', 'death', '.She', 'had', 'Hollywood', 'mockeries', 'crappy', 'movies', 'was', 'offered', 'bad', 'jokes', 'dead-beat', 'husbands/lovers', 'life', 'general.She', 'knew', 'was', 'doomed', 'finished', 'eyes', 'playing', 'last', 'scene.AND', 'THE', 'BEST', 'when', 'open', 'eyes', 'wide', ""MONKEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY'.I"", 'have', 'watched', 'scene', '50', 'times', 'finding', 'so', 'powerful', 'fierce', '.The', 'cheapness', 'sets', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'play', 'good', 'thing', 'scenes', 'Jayne', 'basically', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'quality', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'lower', 'quality', 'VHS', 'i', 'also', 'have', 'watched.Conclusion', 'Jayne', 'was', 'NEVER', 'actress', 'personality.She', 'played', 'herself', 'movie', 'appeared', 'time', 'fed', 'up', 'Battle', 'be', ""'Super-Monroe"", 'was', 'groomed', 'be', 'appropriate', 'LAST', 'FILM', '.So', 'non-fans', 'Jayne', 'awful', 'movie', 'loyal', 'fans', 'almost', 'autobiographical', 'statement', 'how', 'really', 'felt', 'end', 'sad', 'life.Very', 'sad']",Single Room Furnished VHS

230147,A65XH6L5BUX0X,6300251853,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[0, 0]","Jayne Mansfield, like many other big-breasted blonde bombshells in the mid 1950s, wanted her chance at movie stardom. She had the looks, but, also like majority, seemingly lacked the talent. It was the Broadway comedy Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? that brought Jayne to the attention of Hollywood, but still it was her body that got the praise, not her acting. She signed with 20th Century-Fox in May 1956. In Jayne, the studio saw not only a potential sex symbol, but also an insurance policy against their number one actress, the increasingly difficult Marilyn Monroe. As Monroe wanted to branch out from the &#34;dumb blonde&#34; roles, taking time off to study with Lee Strasberg in New York, Fox placed Jayne in the roles Marilyn no longer wanted to play. These films included immensely popular Girl Can't Help It (1956) and the film version of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957). She received good reviews as an ex-stripper in a film version of John Steinbeck's The Wayward Bus (1957), but after Kiss Them for Me (1957), later in the year, her career waned due to the film's mainstream failure.By the late 1950s, Jayne had slipped from being a Marilyn Monroe successor to being saw as a cheaper, cartoon version of Marilyn. Hollywood studios lost interest in Jayne and she was forced to make low-budget European melodramas and comedies, many of which were never released in the USA and some that are considered lost. She later went nude in Promises! Promises! (1963), which still failed to revitalize her declining career. By the time she filmed Single Room Furnished in 1966, she was a Hollywood has-been and her career was at a dead end.MY REVIEWSingle Room Furnished was filmed in 1966, but released in 1968, a year after Ms. Mansfield's untimely death in a automobile accident at just 34. In the film she plays a young woman, lost and lonely in a city of millions, and her desperate attempts to find love and happiness, only to lose it again and again. Through stories told by Pops, the apartment house manager, Johnnie (Mansfield) lives life too full, too fast but with all heart. With each betrayal and loss, she changes her name, hair color, and self-image, and somehow finds to courage to go on. After a painful breakup, Johnnie assumes her alter ego, May, and following even more heartbreaks she becomes Eileen, a prostitute with stories to tell.As I stated in my title, this is not Jayne Mansfield's best or worst film, it falls somewhere in the middle. But owing to Mansfield's persona: the lightheaded blonde with big breasts, who floats through life on her looks, her films can't explore too much, anyways. Her very style of talking and walking, a spin-up of Marilyn Monroe's image, allows her to be placed in only a certain type of role. Basically, Jayne shows she could act in this almost entertaining, melodramatic old-Hollywood flick. This is for the die-hard Jayne Mansfield fans only. There is nothing major to see in this film and it is by far not a classic by any means. It is a film to complete a collection, not a film you necessarily talk about with buddies. Order it if you'd like, but don't be shocked by the outcome.

230148,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,6300251853,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The movie starts out with a monologue explaining the greatness of Jayne Mansfield and how this movie was her finest dramatic roll. Jayne goes from housewife to prostitute giving us a view of her diverse acting skills. Billy M. Dean plays the landlord who reminded me of Grandpa from the Munsters. We have an Italian mom praying to a statue of the Virgin Mary for her daughter. The landlord tells young Mary the story of Jayne Mansfield. The dialouge was bad as was most of the acting. Sometimes the movie digresses to someone telling a story in a story. In a sea of bad acting, Jayne did manage to shine through, but it was like saying Will Ferrell is a great actor when he is in a movie with Steven Seagal and Steve Austin. For some reason Jayne changed her accent from character to character, even though they were the same person. Note that the music had no influence on how the go-go dancers movie.The ""R"" rating is way too high by today's standards.
