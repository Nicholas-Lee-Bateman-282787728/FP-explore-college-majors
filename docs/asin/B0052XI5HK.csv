The plot wasn't amazing, but it wasn't awful. I just didn't like it. Few of the main characters are hardly likable and others are nearly likable. Some might say a squirrel was a cool character, but I guess I've seen is somewhere before. It could be a rip off from other movies, because even the plot itself wasn't original. It's like I've seen it, nearly all of it, before. Therefore the plot is predictable, but not everywhere. The soundtrack was quite good and got better to the end. Overall I'dd give it 3.5 stars. It doesn't have a bad animation, but at least in one place, there were too many windmills and the background looked 'naked'. They could add more details to it and destroy at least half of those repeating windmills. The movie is watchable and some will like, while others not so much.

There are not really any songs in this sequel (except for the goat and one or two by wayne newton though they are short scenes)...something that was lost since Anne Hathaway didn't play Red this time. Also, they didn't follow the general formula of the first which was to take a fairy tale and disassemble it from 3 perspectives. That being said though, the storyline was sweet and engaging (just as much as the first if not more as this time around there were a couple really wonderful life lessons mixed in with the humor) Myself, husband, and our 10 yr old son spent the whole movie laughing (as we did with the first) and we loved it. The animation was charming, the storyline and dialog was funny, and over all we had a great time as a family.

Because of this reason, I am in no position to compare both films. That said, I found the new installment funny and engaging.In ""Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil,"" we find that Red Riding Hood is away training with the prestigious Sister Hoods group. While she is there, Verushka the Witch kidnaps Hansel and Gretel. Nicky Flippers, who is in charge of the Happily Ever After organization (HEA), dispatches a group to rescue the kids. However, the Big Bad Wolf and others from HEA are not up to the task, and fail in their attempt. Hence, Red Riding Hood is called to return immediately, in order that they can liberate Hansel and Gretel from Verushka the Witch. Unfortunately, things are not as easy as planned, and everybody - including us -- is fooled by the original kidnappers. However, Red Riding Hood and the gang are aided by good people along the way.""Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil"" is a very entertaining animated film, full of surprises and fun characters - and some evil ones, too. I truly enjoyed Mad Hog and Stone, with the voices of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, respectively, as well as the annoying Japeth the goat. As a matter of fact, the film is loaded with the voices of celebrities, such as Glenn Close, Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Martin Short, Joan Cusack, David Odgen Stiers, David Alan Grier, Wayne Newton, Brad Garrett, and others.

Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In 2005, the Weinstein Company released their animated film ""Hoodwinked!"" produced by Blue Yonder Films with Kanbar Entertainment which was a film that starred many all-star talent from Anne Hathaway, Glee Close, Jim Belushi, Patrick Warburton and more.The film was successful as the film budgeted at $15 million (which is very low for an animated film), would go on to earn $110 million in the box office.Looked at as an animated parody of ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Hoodwinked!"" introduces us to Little Red Riding Hood, Granny, the Big Bad Wolf and Twitchy the Squirrel.  By the end of the film, the four are enlisted by Nicky Flippers to join the Happily Ever After Agency and take on crime.Fast forward to 2011 and the sequel ""Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil"" which was budgeted around $30 million unfortunately had a delayed release and instead of being released in January 2011 (which the Burger King promotion for the toys began), was released in April 2011 and unfortunately made only half of its budget in the box office.""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" now makes its appearance on Blu-ray with a Blu-ray + DVD release scheduled for an August 16, 2011 release.VIDEO:""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1).  Picture quality  is good.  Nice details on the objects and surroundings are good.  On the main characters, details are good but not as excessive as other big-budget animated films.  Because this film does feature its fair share of animals, you expect to see a lot of hair physics and really making the fur look realistic.  ""Hoodwinked"" is not one of those type of animated films.In fact, at first I was wondering if the film was stop-motion because some of the characters look like models and are solid.  But ""Hoodwinked"" goes for its own style, its own look and it works.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The lossless audio is good but could have been better.  If anything, for an animated film with a lot of action sequences, you would expect to hear more robust surround usage but instead, it becomes more dialogue driven and sound from the front and center channels.  But for the dialogue, audio is clear and understandable.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" comes with the following special features:Music Videos - Included are the following music videos ""I Can Do It Alone"" by Hayden Panettiere (3:34), ""You Know It"" by Lavay Cole (3:02) and ""Perfect Two"" by CeeJ (3:13).The Voices - (19:13) Interview with the celebrity cast of ""Hoodwinked Too!"" with Hayden Panettiere, Patrick Warburton, Heidi Klum, Wayne Newton and David Ogden.Storyboard Sequences- (4:29) Featuring the storyboard sequences for Bridge and HEA Invasion.Production Artwork - Using your remote, view the artwork from ""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"".Hoodwinked Too! Video Game TeaserEXTRAS:""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" comes with a Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.  The DVD is presented in 1:78:1 widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1 plus a $10 off a $30 purchase of Dippin' Dots merchandise coupon on the Dippin' Dots website.JUDGMENT CALL:""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" has its moments of fun and while one can say that fairy tale characters in a hero setting are not that interesting, the first film did very well in the box office.  But I feel that this sequel had some issues from its delayed release (which is never a good thing) and lost out on the kids meal tie-in (as the toys came out months before the movie was released).Needless to say, ""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" unfortunately failed in the box office and whether or not it does well on Blu-ray and DVD, who knows.Is it a family film?  I watched it with my eight-year-old and he enjoyed it as the film does have its funny moments.  But because it is rated PG, many parents may be wondering why the film is PG.For one, you have the three little pigs who are trying to kill Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf, you have the antagonists who want to destroy all living things and there are moments of crude humor.  Granted, nothing overly violent but for some parents, it may be too much for their little ones.  But for older kids, no problem.But I figured that while I found the film to be fun and good, because the film quality-wise in animation and also story-wise was OK, I felt that perhaps maybe my 8-year-old would be a bit more upbeat about the film.I asked my son about what he thought about the film and interesting thing is that he immediately talked about the first film and the kids meal toys (So, I guess the kids meal tie-in is very important for children) and in this case, he talked about how cool the Woodsman was in the first film (he is shown a few times later towards the end of the sequel).He also mentioned that the characters of Red Riding Hood, Granny, the Big Bad Wolf are too boring for him.  So, I guess he didn't like it much as I thought he did and for me, I enjoyed it a bit more.As for the Blu-ray release, I felt the lossless audio could have been better, I felt there could have been more special features included (perhaps even a commentary track) and the picture quality, I felt the animation was good but for a feature film amongst the other competition out there, it's like comparing apples to oranges and ""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" was more like a grape.Overall, ""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" was an OK animated film.  It's not the best, nor is it the worst but it had a feel of a direct-to-video type of film rather than an animated feature.",3,Blu-ray: The film does have its moments of laughter but it seemed more like a direct-to-video style of film.,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,5610,"['2005', 'Weinstein', 'Company', 'released', 'animated', 'film', 'Hoodwinked', 'produced', 'Blue', 'Yonder', 'Films',

Mckinzie,"[0, 1]","Although I think the characters aren't as cute to look at as some animated cartoons have, they're very well done and the characterizations are excellent.  Lots of personality and a serious amount of action makes it a high-velocity story.  It seems that an evil witch has gotten hold of Hansel and Gretel and is planning to eat them.  But, she has an even more evil plan and the safety of the world could be at stake.  Throw in a bunch of fairy tale characters, add a singing Billy goat who can't catch a break but can catch anything that's falling (with his body, unfortunately) a squirrel who has taken caffeine overdose to an all new high, and you've got an action-packed modern fairy tale movie.  Kids are pretty sure to like this, especially boys, and adults may get a kick out of it, too.  I loved it when one character talked about ""Food Channel wannabes"" and another intoned, ""Rachel Ray is the devil!""

In ""Hoodwinked Too"", Red (voiced by Hayden Panettiere) is in training to become a Sister of the Hood, like her Granny before her.  Detective Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers) has organized most of the remaining characters, including Granny (Glen Close), the Wolf (Patrick Warburton), and Twitchy the Squirrel (Corey Edwards) into the Happily Ever After Agency to chase bad guys.  When Hansel and Gretel are kidnapped, the agency rescue plan goes badly, and Granny goes missing.Red will have to cut short her martial arts training in a Shaolin-like temple in the clouds to help rescue Granny and to save a secret recipe that makes its consumers invincible.  She will reluctantly partner with the Big Bad Wolf to face down an evil conspiracy that features a disgruntled witch, some gangster pigs, a scary-looking spider, and a couple of unexpected villains. Boingo the Evil Bunny returns for a superb cameo in full Hannibal Lector mode.""Hoodwinked Too"" has some good moments, but it lacks the freshness and originality of the original movie.

I don't know what it was about that first film film but i loved it. Don't know if it was the twist on classic fairy tale characters and how they twisted them. Or maybe it was the look of the film mixed with the story. Perhaps it was the cast that gave life to the characters or a combination of them all. No matter what was the reason the point is that I loved it. So of course I could not wait until a second film was made, I mean the end of the first begged for it right?Well when it was put out there that the next film was coming I was way to excited about it. I knew from the get go though that the first would always be better. The fresh take that they took for that film would be hard to duplicate and create again. So I knew that while it would still be kinda the same style the new film would have some changes to it. Once we popped this in we loved it but I was right it was a bit different. Still it was a great little flick that we enjoyed, especially my little cuz.This film picks up kinda where the last left off with Red and them now apart of an elite unit of agents for the government. But at this point while all under the same agency they are off on different paths. Granny is kidnapped and the feuding Red and Wolf are at different points in their lives at work. They think they don't need one another and can't stand how the other works. But if Granny is to be saved they must find a way to over come their differences and work together. With the help of old friends as well as new they just might do it.I personally really enjoyed this film as did my girl and little cuz like I said,the first one is the better one but it is still good. I am hoping for a third film to make this a great trilogy, how great would that be? The film has some cool special features and of course a great voice cast. If you loved the first film you should like this one, although the first s the best we should all know by now that sequels are usually never better.

1438135,A3T6HX48F66512,B0052XI5HK,Fry Boy,"[0, 0]","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The story revolves around some of the good and bad characters (Red Riding Hood, her Granny, the Wolf, Hansel & Gretel and their associated witch) from fairly tales with a few extras thrown in.  The plot involves a bungled job by Happily Ever After (H.E.A.) agents where they fail to save Hansel & Gretel from the aforementioned witch. In addition to escaping her gingerbread house with the children, the witch also captures Red Riding Hood's grandmother (also an H.E.A. agent).  The rest of the movie follows Red and Wolf as they attempt to rescue Hansel, Gretel and Granny.While the animation isn't first-rate quality, it's plenty good enough to tell a convincing and enjoyable story.

1438150,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0052XI5HK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","While the original ""Hoodwinked"" might not be my favorite movie of skewed fairy tales (that place in my heart belongs to Shrek), it was a clever colliding of movie styles. With four character narratives intersecting and intertwining, the film played as an amusing riff on ""Rashomon"" and even ""Pulp Fiction"" for the animated set. It was a bit uneven, but it worked largely by pushing the boundaries with a great concept. Eschewing the charm and most of the laughs of its predecessor, the 3-D sequel ""Hoodwinked Too!"" arrives in an impressive DVD package. However, the film itself is all concept and no heart. But what's worse--it boasts a terrific cast of comedic vocal talent, but lacks a real sense of humor. I wanted to like this movie, truly I did, but ultimately I just didn't care about the characters.Set in the aftermath of the first movie, your favorites (Red, Granny, Wolf, Twitchy) are back and part of a elite special forces unit. Called in to rescue Hansel and Gretel from a wicked witch, the mission goes seriously awry leading to Granny being kidnapped. It's all part of a nefarious plan to get the secret ingredient for a truffle that will instill great power to those that eat it. Desperate to save Granny, Red and the crew head to the big city to do battle with ultimate evil. The plot is pleasantly silly, but the screenplay is not. Everything is staged as a loud action set piece which we're supposed to find hilarious. Look, there's Granny doing flips--ha ha. Look at Red bungee jump--hilarious. I wanted more effort to be given to the characters. Make me care and make me laugh by what they have to say. Or if it's all going to be sight gags, make them genuinely funny.The invaluable Patrick Warburton has only a few laughs as Wolf (which is a crime in itself, the guy is genuinely hysterical), but does what he can with the material. Bill Hader and Amy Poehler get the best lines as Hansel and Gretel. Joan Cusack gives a reliably sturdy performance as the wicked witch. Twitchy (Cory Edwards) made me smile once or twice. But poor Glenn Close gets zero as Granny. And Hayden Panettiere is a very flat lead through both performance and script. What a waste of talent! Maybe the kids will like some of the frantic antics, but there are so many better options available on the animation market. I found this to be a real disappointment. While not perfect, the first one had charm and style--this is absolutely robotic and without heart.3-D: I know this is the only element that some people care about, but what does it matter if you don't like the film? The original movie was criticized for its lack of sophistication in animation techniques. I thought it was fine, and I actually like the look of this movie. It's a bit old school, but the animation and the appearance of the characters quite appealed to me. The 3-D on the DVD presentation is serviceable, but not remarkable. There is not an over-abundance of out-of-screen moments, so most of the 3-D just layers the animation. Some of the moments where the camera glides (through the forest, etc) are well orchestrated, but nothing will move this viewing experience to the next level.

Williams,"[3, 7]","Hoodwinked Too is a cute film that keeps the action going and the material is suitable for most, though the witch of Hansel and Gretel might be scary for some small children. I didn't enjoy the sequel as well as the first Hoodwinked, however. I was looking forward to seeing the same unique story line that follows different but intersecting accounts of what happened from the various perspectives of the characters in the fairy tale. Hoodwinked Too doesn't present the story that way and I was a little disappointed.Vivacious Granny is back with all her gusto and Red is the main star, but the dry wit of the wolf played by Patrick Warburton is the real pleaser of this movie. (Warburton is the obnoxious boyfriend in Bee Movie.) The (not so) bad wolf's  character is quite hilarious. During a wild chase, Granny tells him to put his man pants on and ""knuckle up, dog"".

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[3, 5]","HOODWINKED (2005) was an animated feature; a revisionist history that retold the story of LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD, RASHOMAN-style.Questioned by the police, Red, Granny, the Big Bad Wolf and the Woodsman all tell different, but parallel stories about the events that took place at Granny's cottage, painting a remarkably different picture than what children have read about for generations.It was a clever, albeit silly, movie that evoked a few chuckles from the grown-ups, but delighted the small fry.  Some of the songs were very clever.The picture ended with Red, Granny and the Wolf joining the super secret Happily Ever After Agency (HEA), a group that exists to insure that fairy tales have happy endings.HOODWINKED TOO!  HOOD vs EVIL (2011) has just been released by Anchor Bay Entertainment in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.The story pretty much picks up where the original left off.  Red is in training with a covert group, Sisters of the Hood, when HEA calls her in to handle a case.It seems that two children, Hansel and Gretel, have been kidnapped by a wicked witch, and Red, Granny and Wolf are assigned to rescue them.As with the first film, I liked the songs, smiled a few times, but I would have enjoyed the proceedings much more if I was ten-years-old. HOODWINKED TOO!  HOOD vs EVIL is definitely a picture for kids.Glenn Close (Granny), Patrick Warburton (Wolf) and David Ogden Stiers  (Detective Flippers) repeat their voice roles from the original, while Hayden Panettiere takes over from Ann Hathaway as Red and Martin Short replaces Jim Belushi as the Woodsman.  Other voice talents in this one include Bill Hader (Hansel), Amy Poehler (Gretel) and Joan Cusack as the witch.Extras include three music videos and some ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes. Michael B.

Most of the voice acting is effective, especially Corey Edwards' Twitchy, Joan Cusack's evil witch, Patrick Warburton's loutish Wolf; and Bill Hader and Amy Poehler's quirkish Hansel and Gretel.  Glenn Close is fine as Granny, but is underused.  Hayden Panettiere doesn't bring the feisty gusto to Red as Anne Hathaway did.

Michael,"[7, 9]","The original Hoodwinked was fairly meh to being with, though it did have the saving grace of a unique hook in that each main character had a different version of events of what went down. It was a great method of telling a rather blah plot (evil bunny steals a secret recipe, yadda yadda yadda).Here, in Hoodwinked Too, what made its predecessor stick out and rise above its own mediocrity is thrown away... instead, it follows the Shrek formula of ""generic adventure + copious pop culture reference = profit??""Now agents for the Happily Ever After agency (basically fairy tale SWAT), the returning cast (with Hayden Panettiere replacing Anne Hathaway, who smartly didn't join in this crapfest) is at each others' throats due to Wolf being upset that Red is away learning baking kung fu from a mysteriously cliche Sisterhood.Desserts are again the MacGuffin of the movie, this time taking the form of an ultra-chic chocolate truffle (made from the rarest of ingredients) that grants superpowers. So difficult is it to make this recipe that the film's villains kidnap Granny to force her to bake it.Really, there's not much to prop up the film... Wolf and Twitchy do most of the work comedically, switching the role of straight man back and forth between them. The buddy cop trope cattiness between Wolf and Red is forced and, while Joan Cusack's turn as the evil witch Verushka can at times be fun, for the most part it's a letdown.Especially painful to watch were Hansel and Gretel doing a reprise of Andy Dick's showstopping ""You've been hoodwinked, baby"" song from the first film, turning it into ""You've been hoodwinked TOO!"" Oiy ve... it was fun the first time, but slapping new paint and a few new vocals on it for a second go'round lacked the soul and wit that Dick brought to the cute fluffy bunny gone bad. Sure, Boingo shows up for a brief cameo, but dumping him for Hansel and Gretel... terrible idea. The least the writers could've done was make him the secret puppet master of the whole thing instead of just a go between for The Witch and the criminal element.Annnnnyways, Hoodwinked Too did a great job of killing off any potential it had to make me smile when it dropped the structure of the first's narrative and instead decided to become a cheap Shrek imitation doing casual pop riffs on fairy tale standbys.All but young children should stay far, faaaaaar away from this dreck.",1,Yeowch...

1438169,AHF97M45JFCB,B0052XI5HK,ONENEO,"[0, 2]","The first Hoodwinked, though nothing too revolutionary, made a name for itself in a very competitive industry on account of the fact that it, like Shrek before it, managed to walk the thin between classic fairy tale and pop culture sensibilities.  I wasn't overly enamored with the original, though appreciated a bit of the originality it contained especially considering it was done on a shoestring budget by a small company.Naturally, as is the way of things in Hollywonk, a successful project deserves another and thus brings us to Hoodwinked Too! Hood Versus Evil, the 2011 animated feature film from the Weinstein Company.  Built on a reputed $30 million budget (roughly double that of the first film), Too! is 86-minutes long and wears an appropriate PG rating.The story, or what passes for one here goes something like this:  Red (Hayden Panettiere), a member of the mysterious warrior order ""Sisters of the Hood"", is roped into service by the top-secret Happily Ever After Agency when Granny (Glenn Close) is kidnapped by a witch (Joan Cusack) during a failed rescue attempt of the imprisoned Hansel and Gretel (Bill Hader and Amy Poehler). Hot on the trail are Red's friends Wolf (Patrick Warburton) and the squirrel Twitchy (Cory Edwards).From there it's a procession of pop-culture puns, plays on words, and cute little sociological riffs in rapid fire succession.  No you aren't going to find much emotional attachment here like you would in a modern Pixar piece (or for that matter a classic Disney film), instead prepare for a quick witted script delivered by A-list actors that outshines its lackluster visuals.Surprisingly, the film has received overwhelming negative reviews from the onset despite the fact that fairy tales blended with contemporary references are harder to pull off than most realize (reference any of the three Unstable Fables or the two Happily Never Afters for more definitive proof of this phenomenon).  Arguable only the severely over-milked Shrek franchise has succeeded and to be completely honest, Hoodwinked Too! doesn't feel as convoluted or as poorly paced as (the generally higher regarded film of the same year), Puss in Boots.However that's not to suggest Too! isn't without its misfires either- if you aren't particularly impressed with spoof scenes of other popular movies, be forewarned, this film is chock full of them.  Some are simply too clich&eacute;d for any real enjoyment (Terminator's ""I'll be back"" or Scarface's ""Say Hello to My Little Friend"") but a few (like Boingo Bunny's ""Hello Clarice"" have bite.  It certainly helps to go into the film in a silly mood.In all, I suppose critics were more upset at the lack of clever story or singular enduring character but going back to the original Hoodwinked should really be proof enough that this series is more about zingers and pop culture references than it is creating a modern classic.

The production quality is about what one would expect for a kids movie (this isn't being done by Dreamworks or Pixar (it is being done by a company named ""The Weinstein Company,"" which I have never heard of) but what I wasn't expecting were the fairly numerous jokes aimed squarely at adults. They put a lot of juvenile humor and silly actions sequences in as well -- but the movie is also fairly sprinkled with in-jokes and movie references just for adults.  The kids will still understand what is going on, but the adults will have more of a reason to smile.The voice acting for this movie is fairly spot-on, although I am not sure I understand how Patrick Warburton keeps getting cast for voice work. He was a very good fit for Kronk inThe Emperor's New Grooveas that was what the character called for, a large powerfully present voice, that was kind of slow and dull witted.  But, after that movie Warbuton kept getting cast in more and more roles outside of that type of character. It is baffling.  I am sure kids will recognize the voice and enjoy it though.  Hayden Panettiere does a good job voicing Red, and her character is a nice, strong female character young girls can look up to.  I was baffled by th ""3 little pigs"" being included as evil henchmen with hispanic accents, but I am assuming they set that up in the first movie?All in all, I liked the plot twist, I enjoyed the humor, and I was able to overlook the production quality.

I've always liked cartoons like Shrek which have a quick amusing story which children love, and enough jokes thrown in for the adults to enjoy.  I wasn't impressed though.  I never watched the first movie so I can't really compare it to that.  I'll just judge the movie on it's own merit.The plot is simple enough.  A clandestine agency called (HEA) Happily Ever After helps protect the world of fairy tales and keep happy endings in tact.  At the start of the story the agency tries to save Hansel and Gretel who are kidnapped by the evil witch.  The plan goes south and Red Riding Hood's grandma gets captured.  So Red, Wold, and Twitchy set off to save her.The movie has a laugh or two every now and then.  But ultimately it's just not funny.  Most of the jokes fall flat.  The animation still looks good even though it was produced on a relatively small budget.  And they did retain some good voice talent.Patrick Warburton is always funny no matter what he's in.  And this is no exception.  Also Amy Pohler, Cheech Marin, and Martin Short add their talents.  But this is still not enough to pull the movie out.  It just falls flat.  At least for adults anyway.

Not only did this movie hold their interest, they loved it and came to where I was to give me updates on the plot (which would be spoilers). After it was over, they discussed their favorite parts and gathered toys together to act it out and to create further adventures for the characters.As to the DVD itself, the special features are limited. I don't like DVDs that don't allow the option of heading straight to the menu. We had to go through the previews to reach the menu, something that's especially annoying if you have children clamoring for their movies.So it might not be the world's best movie but it's not awful either. I was comfortable letting my kids be the judges and they thought it was a lot of fun.

We discussed the elements of a movie review beforehand and I asked the students to look out for certain aspects of the film as they watched.  I will give a brief summary of some of their answers:1. My favorite characters:  ""Grandma"" because she has a funny laugh. ""Wolf"" because he was the coolest of all the characters.2.Did you like the film...why or why not?  The overwhelming majority of my students had previously seen the original HOODWINKED and they all loved the movie. One student said ""it was funny and sad at the same time.""  The one student who did NOT care for the movie said ""it was a little boring. It needed more action.""3.Voices of Characters? After the movie we watched the special features where they showed the real actors doing their voiceovers. They were particularly surprised to see Heidi Klum from ""Project Runway"" speaking with a thick German accent.4. Favorite scenes? They liked the Ogre on the bridge scene with Red, and the scene where Heidi Klum's character was ""jumping up and down on the pigs.""5. Appropriate for What Ages? The students all agreed that this movie was best suited for children aged 10 or 11 and higher. They thought middle school students would like it the most. Some thought that adults would like it, too.6. Better than the original HOODWINKED? All but one student said HOODWINKED TOO was better than the original. Having never seen the first one I have no opinion.Overall, my class was quiet and watched intently. They lauged and got excited at the appropriate times durinng their viewing. Several students have asked to borrow HOODWINKED TOO so they could show their brothers and sisters.",5,Classroom Review,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,1781,"['reward', 'successful', 'first', 'week', 'school', 'showed', 'HOODWINKED', 'TOO', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'special', 'education', 'students', 'Friday', 'discussed', 'elements', 'movie', 'review', 'beforehand', 'asked', 'students', 'look', 'out', 'certain', 'aspects', 'film', 'watched', 'will', 'give', 'brief', 'summary', 'answers:1', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Grandma', 'funny', 'laugh', 'Wolf', 'was', 'coolest', 'characters.2.Did', 'film', 'why', 'why', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'students', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'original', 'HOODWINKED', 'loved', 'movie', 'One', 'student', 'said', 'was', 'funny', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'student', 'who', 'did', 'NOT', 'care', 'movie', 'said', 'was', 'little', 'boring', 'needed', 'more', 'action', '3.Voices', 'Characters', 'movie', 'watched', 'special', 'features', 'where', 'showed', 'real', 'actors', 'doing', 'voiceovers', 'were', 'particularly', 'surprised', 'see', 'Heidi', 'Klum', 'Project', 'Runway', 'speaking', 'thick', 'German', 'accent.4', 'Favorite', 'scenes', 'liked', 'Ogre', 'bridge', 'scene', 'Red', 'scene', 'where', 'Heidi', 'Klum', 'character', 'was', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'pigs.', '5', 'Appropriate', 'What', 'Ages', 'students', 'agreed', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'suited', 'children', 'aged', '10', '11', 'higher', 'thought', 'middle', 'school', 'students', 'would', 'like', 'most', 'thought', 'adults', 'would', 'like', 'too.6', 'Better', 'original', 'HOODWINKED', 'one', 'student', 'said', 'HOODWINKED', 'TOO', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'Having', 'never', 'seen', 'first', 'one', 'have', 'opinion.Overall', 'class', 'was', 'quiet', 'watched', 'intently', 'lauged', 'got', 'excited', 'appropriate', 'times', 'durinng', 'viewing', 'Several', 'students', 'have', 'asked', 'borrow', 'HOODWINKED', 'TOO', 'could', 'show', 'brothers', 'sisters']",Hoodwinked Too!

1438188,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0052XI5HK,Todd Smith,"[1, 3]","As adults, we loath kids movies. Sure, some people get into the Disney stuff, but for the most part, adults despise films that are made for kids and I am no exception. It takes a really good story and some clever writing for a PG film to appeal to adults as much as it does to kids, and it's virtually impossible to do this while still keeping the PG rating intact, but somehow the writers of Hoodwinked have accomplished this twice! The story really isn't important, it's geared toward kids and is very simple and predictable. What's not easy is keeping the adults awake, while the kids have the time of their lives. The writers accomplished this by throwing in parodies of classic adult films. Hoodwinked Too! has references to Goodfella, Die Hard, Silence of The Lambs, and a half a dozen other classic films, and it was those scenes that were the most fun. Also interesting to note, the voice of the wolf was done by Patrick Warburton, who does the voice of Joe Swanson on Family Guy, and it was really difficult for me to see the wolf as a totally different character. Hoodwinked and now it's sequel are nothing like Toy Story and aren't going to blow anyone away, but they are pretty good and while the kids are watching it, you'll find yourself getting in a few laughs as well. Hoodwinked Too! is a terrific family film with something for the whole family and is really the definition of what a family film should be.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,1424,"['adults', 'loath', 'kids', 'movies', 'Sure', 'people', 'get', 'Disney', 'stuff', 'most', 'part', 'adults', 'despise', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'kids', 'am', 'exception', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'clever', 'writing', 'PG', 'film', 'appeal', 'adults', 'as', 'much', 'kids', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'do', 'while', 'still', 'keeping', 'PG', 'rating', 'intact', 'somehow', 'writers', 'Hoodwinked', 'have', 'accomplished', 'twice', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'important', 'geared', 'kids', 'very', 'simple', 'predictable', 'What', 'not', 'easy', 'keeping', 'adults', 'awake', 'kids', 'have', 'time', 'lives', 'writers', 'accomplished', 'throwing', 'parodies', 'classic', 'adult', 'films', 'Hoodwinked', 'Too', 'references', 'Goodfella', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'half', 'dozen', 'other', 'classic', 'films', 'was', 'scenes', 'were', 'most', 'fun', 'Also', 'interesting', 'note', 'voice', 'wolf', 'was', 'done', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'who', 'voice', 'Joe', 'Swanson', 'Family', 'Guy', 'was', 'really', 'difficult', 'see', 'wolf', 'totally', 'different', 'character', 'Hoodwinked', 'now', 'sequel', 'are', 'nothing', 'Toy', 'Story', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'blow', 'anyone', 'away', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'kids', 'are', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'find', 'getting', 'few', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', 'Hoodwinked', 'Too', 'terrific', 'family', 'film', 'something', 'whole', 'family', 'really', 'definition', 'what', 'family', 'film', 'should', 'be']",Hoodwinked Too!

Red (Panetiere), Granny (Close), Twitchy and the Wolf are back. This time they are part of a detective agency that is set up to give everyone their happy endings. When an evil witch kidnaps Hansel & Gretel it is up to Red and the gang to find and rescue them. Being an adult and father I am required by law to watch cartoons with my kids. Some of the recent ones were a struggle. This one I was more excited about then they were. The first one was hilarious and this one held up very well. This is a ""Shrek"" like cartoon in the way that 90% of the jokes are geared toward grown-ups. There is a ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and a ""Goodfellas"" reference thrown in, which most kids will not understand. To be fair though, my kids laughed at the slapstick aspect and it kept my 2 year old interested, so it is good for kids as well. When compared to the first one, I will have to say that they are equally funny. This one had more adult humor then the first one though. Overall, a great movie for adults that kids will enjoy.
