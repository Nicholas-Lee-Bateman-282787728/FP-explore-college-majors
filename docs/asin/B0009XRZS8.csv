916371,A2PYMYL11MW8N5,B0009XRZS8,Aaron Wooldridge,"[1, 1]","Disclaimer: I am a grown man with no children. Your kids will probably disagree with my criticisms and not care what I think about this movie in the slightest. That is fine.Duma is a very fun (if extremely unrealistic) family film about a boy in South Africa whose family raises an orphaned cheetah from the time it is a kitten. When the cheetah grows up the boy and his father begin planning to take him to the place where he was born and release him to the wild, but the father suddenly dies before they can begin their journey. The mother decides to move the family to the city where the cheetah predictably gets loose, causes a panic, and nearly gets shot by trigger happy police. The boy, still in his school uniform with no provisions packed, takes the cheetah in his father's motorcycle with sidecar in an attempt to travel the many miles to the cheetah's homeland. The boy and his cheetah travel through the deserts and savannahs of Africa, befriended by a native tribesman on a journey of his own.This movie is definitely deserving of criticism. The plot is contrived, many of the events don't make sense, the characters never seem to be in any real danger, everything is too linear without enough side plots that should have been fleshed out, and the ending is much too abrupt. But with all of its flaws, Duma is an extremely entertaining movie. It is fun, humorous, adventurous, and genuinely emotionally touching. The kid is a good actor, and his relationship with the cheetah is probably some of the best child/animal chemistry ever to appear in a major motion picture. The star of the film really is Duma the cheetah, and Duma is just a big loveable housecat who does things that cats do. He also makes the cutest little chirping/meowing sounds.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is in the mood for a good family adventure - especially anyone who loves cats. However unless you have children I don't recommend buying this one because it might not be so good on repeat viewings.",4,Touching & fun family film with simplistic plot.,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,2000,"['Disclaimer', 'am', 'grown', 'man', 'children', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'disagree', 'criticisms', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'think', 'movie', 'slightest', 'fine.Duma', 'very', 'fun', 'extremely', 'unrealistic', 'family', 'film', 'boy', 'South', 'Africa', 'family', 'orphaned', 'cheetah', 'time', 'kitten', 'When', 'cheetah', 'up', 'boy', 'father', 'begin', 'planning', 'take', 'place', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'release', 'wild', 'father', 'suddenly', 'can', 'begin', 'journey', 'mother', 'move', 'family', 'city', 'where', 'cheetah', 'predictably', 'loose', 'panic', 'nearly', 'shot', 'trigger', 'happy', 'police', 'boy', 'still', 'school', 'uniform', 'provisions', 'packed', 'cheetah', 'father', 'motorcycle', 'sidecar', 'attempt', 'travel', 'many', 'miles', 'cheetah', 'homeland', 'boy', 'cheetah', 'travel', 'deserts', 'savannahs', 'Africa', 'befriended', 'native', 'tribesman', 'journey', 'own.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'deserving', 'criticism', 'plot', 'contrived', 'many', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'characters', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'real', 'danger', 'everything', 'too', 'linear', 'enough', 'side', 'plots', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'ending', 'much', 'too', 'abrupt', 'flaws', 'Duma', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'fun', 'humorous', 'adventurous', 'genuinely', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'kid', 'good', 'actor', 'relationship', 'cheetah', 'probably', 'best', 'child/animal', 'chemistry', 'ever', 'appear', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'star', 'film', 'really', 'Duma', 'cheetah', 'Duma', 'just', 'big', 'loveable', 'housecat', 'who', 'things', 'cats', 'do', 'also', 'cutest', 'little', 'chirping/meowing', 'sounds.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'mood', 'good', 'family', 'adventure', 'especially', 'anyone', 'who', 'cats', 'However', 'have', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'repeat', 'viewings']",Duma

I was a sopping mess most the way through as I watched one of 1995's most stunning movies. Duma opens with some close-ups of adorable cheetah cubs, so instantly you're captivated, but the film is so much more than cute.Duma is also a fabulous story of the mysteries of human existence, the often-indefinable search for home and the habitual harshness and ruggedness of the animal world. It's an affecting, penetratingly gorgeous movie, a film of exquisite beauty as it tells the story about a boy and his cheetah, a boy and his patrimony, and his search to reconnect after calamity befalls him.Xan (Alexander Michaletos), and Peter his father (Campbell Scott) live on a farm in South Africa. One night after hurtling through the countryside in a vintage sport scar they spot a cub in the center of the highway. After plucking the cub from danger, Xan brings the rescue home, where his mother, Kristin (Hope Davis) tends to the precious little animal.Encouraged by Peter, Xan domesticates the cat, Duma, who quickly grows into a soccer-playing, motorcycle-racing wonderment. Now named Duma the time soon comes for him to be let back into the wild, After all, what is cute today will become the wild, veracious thing of tomorrow.However, tragedy strikes before Peter can help Zan set him free, and what follows next is nothing short of astonishing. The boy and the cheetah end up tearing across the desert on Peter's motorcycle (with Duma in the sidecar), treacherously alone. When they run out of fuel and then water, they soon meet a wayfarer named Rip (Eamonn Walker) who comes equipped with a bush baby and an obscure past.The three then embark on an epic journey, sort of Huck Finn like across the harsh African wilderness hoping to find a place Duma can call home. The film is really a masterpiece and as Xan on his trek learns about life, death, courage, responsibility, love and his own wild nature. In this scorched land, Xan becomes his truest, most natural self as talks to his beloved pet freely, without worry or self-consciousness. It's a dream world for a young boy.Xan, Duma and Rip must face many challenges as their quest unfolds - dangerous rivers, and crocodiles, the worry finding food, and the sense that betrayal could come at any moment.Newcomer Alex Michaeletos turns in a beautifully understated performance as the troubled Xan  - he feels so out-of-place in the modern world with only Duma as his real friend. Hope Davis and Campbell Scott are also standouts as Xan's devoted and loving parents, and of course there's the magisterial cheetah.Just as mesmeric are the sweeping African landscapes that seem to swallow both Xan and Duma up as their epic physical and emotional journey plays out. Using both intimate close-ups and expansive long shots director Carroll Ballard makes the most of the dazzling surroundings.Like all those cheetahs the landscape, with its seemingly endless ocher grasslands and shocks of bright blue and emerald, as shot by cinematographer Werner Maritz appears strangely and bewitchingly timeless, just as the friendship does between this gutsy, fearless boy and his big, beautiful and loving cat.

916375,ARA48345JZPZR,B0009XRZS8,Archmaker,"[2, 3]","Carroll Ballard's films are such superior family fare that it is a mystery to me why they aren't overwhelming hits in the theatre.  Ballard starts at a level of respect for the intelligence of children and his films never condescend to them and this lack of dumbing-down makes them a pleasure for their parents as well.  And so it is with this wonderful tale of a South African boy who raises an orphaned cheetah and the adventures he has when he must undertake to return him to the wild by himself.Ballard's films are always beautiful to behold and this one is no exception, with the desert landscapes photographed exquisitely by Werner Maritz.  With brief but solid supporting performances from Campbell Scott and Hope Davis as the boy's parents, the main characters in the film are Alexander Michaeletos as Xan, the boy, and Eamonn Walker as Rip, the drifter he encounters on his journey.  Both are fine.  And of course, the other main performer is Duma, the cheetah, and here Ballard again works his magic with animals creating a natural rapport between the luminous big cat and his human co-stars.There is tragedy, danger, humor and finally wisdom woven through this story.  Something that might stimulate discussion when the film is done.  This is first-rate film-making by any measure and you should treat yourself to a lively story told with humor and sensitivity and filled with the beauty of rugged landscape and the unbelievable natural beauty of the magnificent animal at its center.",5,Superior in so many ways....,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,1495,"['Carroll', 'Ballard', 'films', 'are', 'such', 'superior', 'family', 'fare', 'mystery', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'overwhelming', 'hits', 'theatre', 'Ballard', 'level', 'respect', 'intelligence', 'children', 'films', 'never', 'condescend', 'lack', 'dumbing-down', 'pleasure', 'parents', 'well', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'South', 'African', 'boy', 'who', 'orphaned', 'cheetah', 'adventures', 'when', 'must', 'undertake', 'return', 'wild', 'himself.Ballard', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'beautiful', 'behold', 'one', 'exception', 'desert', 'photographed', 'exquisitely', 'Werner', 'Maritz', 'brief', 'solid', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'boy', 'parents', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'Alexander', 'Michaeletos', 'Xan', 'boy', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'Rip', 'drifter', 'journey', 'are', 'fine', 'course', 'other', 'main', 'performer', 'Duma', 'cheetah', 'here', 'Ballard', 'again', 'magic', 'animals', 'creating', 'natural', 'rapport', 'luminous', 'big', 'cat', 'human', 'co-stars.There', 'tragedy', 'danger', 'humor', 'finally', 'wisdom', 'woven', 'story', 'Something', 'might', 'stimulate', 'discussion', 'when', 'film', 'done', 'first-rate', 'film-making', 'measure', 'should', 'treat', 'lively', 'story', 'told', 'humor', 'sensitivity', 'filled', 'beauty', 'rugged', 'landscape', 'unbelievable', 'natural', 'beauty', 'magnificent', 'animal', 'center']",Duma
916376,A2OHKU60GJLS1A,B0009XRZS8,Beans,"[0, 0]","For me, Duma is the best of Carroll Ballard's films, and it has become one of my personal favorites of all time.  Shot on location in Botswana, this film is truly  - in the words of Manohla Dargis of the New York Times - &#34;soulful, piercingly beautiful.&#34;Coupla things......the film claims to be based on the book &#34;How it was with Dooms&#34; by Xan Hopcraft and Carol Cawthra Hopcraft.  (I purchased the book shortly after I saw Duma for the first time a few years ago. This book deserves a read, it is absolutely fantastic, but I can no longer get the version that I have which is a beautifully bound paperback in color.  If you order the book on Amazon it will be the black and white version and it is awful.  You would need to order it through Barnes and Noble, they have the color version but it is poorly bound.)  It is the true story of a family who live on a farm outside of Nairobi and adopt an orphaned cheetah they name &#34;Dooms&#34;.  He is so tame he chooses to live with them until his death years later.  Xan writes his memoir of growing up with Dooms who is already part of the family when Xan is born.  His recollections are through the eyes of a young boy.  It is precious, and the photos are astounding.The film, Duma, is inspired by the book, but they changed most of the story.  The family lives on a farm in South Africa, and Xan is 12 when he and his father adopt an orphaned cheetah cub they find by the side of the road one night.  Duma lives with them until he is almost full grown.  Most of the film is the story of Xan's long journey with  perilous adventures through the African landscape - which includes crossing the Okavango River - taking Duma back to where they found him so he can live the life he was born to.  Along the way Xan meets a wanderer named Ripkuna and his Bush Baby, and they share the adventures together.  The cinematography is exquisite, and Ballard's touch makes you feel as if you are right there, nuzzling with Duma, keeping lions at bay with a good fire, racing through the rapids to beat the crocodiles, or just cruising down the river in the canoe at sunset, catching glimpses of hippos, elephants and giraffes.Campbell Scott appears briefly in the beginning of the film as Xan's father.  The true stars of the film are Alexander Michaletos who plays Xan, Eammon Walker who plays Ripkuna, and Anthony, the cheetah.  Recently I Googled Michaletos and discovered that he grew up at The Farm Inn in Pretoria, South Africa, a hotel and wildlife sanctuary with 23 species of animals, so he was perfect in the part!  They even have a cheetah breeding program there -- and Anthony!  Guests can visit with Anthony and have their photos taken with him!  He's tame as toast.  You can find the Inn on Facebook.Amazing what a little movie can do.  Duma has not only brought me, my family and many of my friends a lot of joy as a film, we are now planning our own adventure to travel 8,000 miles to visit The Farm Inn and Anthony in the next year!",5,Ballard's Best,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,3002,"['Duma', 'best', 'Carroll', 'Ballard', 'films', 'become', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'time', 'Shot', 'location', 'Botswana', 'film', 'truly', 'words', 'Manohla', 'Dargis', 'New', 'York', 'Times', '34', 'soulful', 'piercingly', 'beautiful.', '34', 'Coupla', 'things', 'film', 'claims', 'be', 'based', 'book', '34', 'How', 'was', 'Dooms', '34', 'Xan', 'Hopcraft', 'Carol', 'Cawthra', 'Hopcraft', 'purchased', 'book', 'shortly', 'saw', 'Duma', 'first', 'time', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'book', 'read', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'get', 'version', 'have', 'beautifully', 'bound', 'paperback', 'color', 'order', 'book', 'Amazon', 'will', 'be', 'black', 'white', 'version', 'awful', 'would', 'need', 'order', 'Barnes', 'Noble', 'have', 'color', 'version', 'poorly', 'bound', 'true', 'story', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'farm', 'Nairobi', 'adopt', 'orphaned', 'cheetah', 'name', '34', 'Dooms', '34', 'so', 'tame', 'live', 'death', 'years', 'later', 'Xan', 'memoir', 'growing', 'up', 'Dooms', 'who', 'already', 'part', 'family', 'when', 'Xan', 'born', 'recollections', 'are', 'eyes', 'young', 'boy', 'precious', 'photos', 'are', 'astounding.The', 'film', 'Duma', 'inspired', 'book', 'changed', 'most', 'story', 'family', 'farm', 'South', 'Africa', 'Xan', '12', 'when', 'father', 'adopt', 'orphaned', 'cheetah', 'cub', 'find', 'side', 'road', 'one', 'night', 'Duma', 'almost', 'full', 'grown', 'Most', 'film', 'story', 'Xan', 'long', 'journey', 'perilous', 'adventures', 'African', 'landscape', 'crossing', 'Okavango', 'River', 'taking', 'Duma', 'back', 'where', 'found', 'so', 'can', 'live', 'life', 'was', 'born', 'way', 'Xan', 'wanderer', 'named', 'Ripkuna', 'Bush', 'Baby', 'share', 'adventures', 'together', 'cinematography', 'exquisite', 'Ballard', 'touch', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'nuzzling', 'Duma', 'keeping', 'lions', 'bay', 'good', 'fire', 'racing', 'rapids', 'beat', 'crocodiles', 'just', 'cruising', 'down', 'river', 'canoe', 'sunset', 'catching', 'glimpses', 'hippos', 'elephants', 'giraffes.Campbell', 'Scott', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'film', 'Xan', 'father', 'true', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'Alexander', 'Michaletos', 'who', 'Xan', 'Eammon', 'Walker', 'who', 'Ripkuna', 'Anthony', 'cheetah', 'Recently', 'Googled', 'Michaletos', 'discovered', 'grew', 'up', 'Farm', 'Inn', 'Pretoria', 'South', 'Africa', 'hotel', 'wildlife', 'sanctuary', '23', 'species', 'animals', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'even', 'have', 'cheetah', 'breeding', 'program', 'there', 'Anthony', 'Guests', 'can', 'visit', 'Anthony', 'have', 'photos', 'taken', 'tame', 'toast', 'can', 'find', 'Inn', 'Facebook.Amazing', 'what', 'little', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'Duma', 'not', 'only', 'brought', 'family', 'many', 'friends', 'lot', 'joy', 'film', 'are', 'now', 'planning', 'own', 'adventure', 'travel', '8,000', 'miles', 'visit', 'Farm', 'Inn', 'Anthony', 'next', 'year']",Duma

Most potential Xans were too scared of the beast to approach it. It is this comfort level between Alex/Xan and Duma that makes the film believable, and Alex's slight Afrikaans accent just heightens the realism. (Like Xan, Alex was raised on a South African farm surrounded by lions, leopards, wild dogs and antelope.)The fictional plot is a bit contrived, but the film takes you in unexpectedly interesting directions through amazing landscapes.

He basicly goes from a young kid to young adult. His father and him find a baby Cheetah that has lost its mother. He raises it. About half the movie is him and the Cheetah growing older. His dad then suggest he return the Cheetah, which he has named Duma, to the wild as had he said they would have to do from the time they first got it. He is apprehensive not only because Duma is his best friend, but his father is ill with cancer. When his father passes away he decides he must do what his father suggested and return Duma to the wild near where they first found him. His mom, Duma, and him have moved to the city and both he and Duma are not doing well. Since the place they found Duma is far from his home he takes his father's motorcycle and heads out without his mothers knowledge. He encounters a native to the land and they both make the journey which teaches them both something of human and animal nature. I liked this movie for a number of reasons. I appreciate the fact they used people that were from the region, and filmed on location.

916383,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0009XRZS8,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","I have to admit I watched this family film solely based on Roger Ebert's enthusiastic thumbs-up, and I'm glad I did. It made me immediately recall a film from my childhood, Alexander Mackendrick's 1963 ""A Boy Ten Feet Tall"" about a boy who travels the length of the African continent by himself after his parents are killed. The more obvious inspiration, however, is James Hill's 1966 ""Born Free"" about a lioness that needs to be returned to the wild. The fact that this 2005 film is directed by Carroll Ballard, who made the remarkable 1979 film, ""The Black Stallion"", ensures a level of craftsmanship rare in films these days. Thanks mainly to the sumptuous cinematography by Werner Maritz, this is a panoramic nature film of the highest order.The plot itself is small as befitting a family film. Based on a true story, it focuses on twelve year-old Xan, who has raised a cheetah named Duma on his family's South African farm since both were cubs. A tragedy forces Xan to take Duma out to the wild, where it belongs, without telling his mother. He makes it on a motorcycle to the middle of the Kalahari Desert where he runs out of gas and meets a suspicious wanderer named Ripkuna. Their adventures together make up the best parts of the film after a too-lengthy set-up in South Africa.  There are impressive scenes highlighting the rapport between Xan and Duma, and Ballard sets up some highly creative action sequences around the motorcycle's conversion into a wind-surfing vehicle, a collapsing mine tunnel, an overwhelming tsetse fly attack and a hair-raising whitewater raft trip amid hungry crocodiles.  It is the realism of these scenes that makes the film resonate more than a standard animal film.The acting is not the chief attraction here. However, Alexander Michaletos, who was apparently raised on a farm among cheetahs, plays Xan with natural &eacute;lan, and Eamonn Kelly brings the requisite mystery to Ripkuna. Sporting British accents, indie favorites Campbell Scott and Hope Davis have little more than cameos as Xan's parents. The 2006 DVD is light on extras - no commentary or making-of featurette (which could have been fascinating in this case); just the trailer and a couple of extended scenes are included. Still, this is a fine film to appreciate Ballard's too-rarely-seen cinematic artistry in conveying the delicate balance between humans and animals.",4,The Return of Carroll Ballard in a Magical Cheetah Adventure,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2381,"['have', 'admit', 'watched', 'family', 'film', 'solely', 'based', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'enthusiastic', 'thumbs-up', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'made', 'immediately', 'recall', 'film', 'childhood', 'Alexander', 'Mackendrick', '1963', 'Boy', 'Ten', 'Feet', 'Tall', 'boy', 'who', 'length', 'African', 'continent', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'more', 'obvious', 'inspiration', 'however', 'James', 'Hill', '1966', 'Born', 'Free', 'lioness', 'be', 'returned', 'wild', 'fact', '2005', 'film', 'directed', 'Carroll', 'Ballard', 'who', 'made', 'remarkable', '1979', 'film', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'level', 'craftsmanship', 'rare', 'films', 'days', 'Thanks', 'mainly', 'sumptuous', 'cinematography', 'Werner', 'Maritz', 'panoramic', 'nature', 'film', 'highest', 'order.The', 'plot', 'small', 'befitting', 'family', 'film', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'twelve', 'year-old', 'Xan', 'who', 'raised', 'cheetah', 'named', 'Duma', 'family', 'South', 'African', 'farm', 'were', 'cubs', 'tragedy', 'forces', 'Xan', 'take', 'Duma', 'wild', 'where', 'telling', 'mother', 'motorcycle', 'middle', 'Kalahari', 'Desert', 'where', 'gas', 'suspicious', 'wanderer', 'named', 'Ripkuna', 'adventures', 'together', 'make', 'up', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'too-lengthy', 'set-up', 'South', 'Africa', 'are', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'highlighting', 'rapport', 'Xan', 'Duma', 'Ballard', 'up', 'highly', 'creative', 'action', 'sequences', 'motorcycle', 'conversion', 'wind-surfing', 'vehicle', 'collapsing', 'mine', 'tunnel', 'overwhelming', 'tsetse', 'fly', 'attack', 'hair-raising', 'whitewater', 'raft', 'trip', 'hungry', 'crocodiles', 'realism', 'scenes', 'film', 'resonate', 'more', 'standard', 'animal', 'film.The', 'acting', 'not', 'chief', 'attraction', 'here', 'However', 'Alexander', 'Michaletos', 'who', 'was', 'apparently', 'raised', 'farm', 'cheetahs', 'plays', 'Xan', 'natural', 'eacute', 'Eamonn', 'Kelly', 'requisite', 'mystery', 'Ripkuna', 'Sporting', 'British', 'accents', 'indie', 'favorites', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'cameos', 'Xan', 'parents', '2006', 'DVD', 'light', 'extras', 'commentary', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'case', 'just', 'trailer', 'couple', 'extended', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'Still', 'fine', 'film', 'appreciate', 'Ballard', 'too-rarely-seen', 'cinematic', 'artistry', 'conveying', 'delicate', 'balance', 'humans', 'animals']",Duma

Xan is on a mission to release Duma back into the wild after years of living with Xan's family on a farm. Xan is still reeling from his father's untimely death. They meet up with an African wanderer, who turns out to be an invaluable companion.The film's setting is fantastic. Beautiful deserts, real lions and African wildlife. Duma the Cheetah is a great actor. At times, I thought it was a robotic Cheetah because I couldn't believe a real Cheetah would be such a good actor. But Duma hits it spot on.There are some odd moments in the film, mostly due to one or two silly plot twists. For example, at one point Xan's traveling companion becomes stuck under a pile of rocks and sand. At this point, Xan had reason to suspect that his companion was going to sell him out, so he left him stuck under the rocks. It was kind of disturbing to see such a young kid do that to somebody, no matter how bad he is. Of course, later on they make up and become good friends. But again, kind of odd.Another note: Cheetahs are adorable, and this film will make you want one as a pet.

Oh no, a cute animal movie, he was no doubt thinking.Well yes, Little Duma, with his squeaks and kittenish big eyes, is cute, but not in the syrupy Disney way but as a precious, real tiny creature.The story begins with Duma's mother meeting a bad end from a lion. A young boy and his father rescue the cub.At the halfway point, the movie swerved into a quest for Duma's home.  The film felt like part Mad Max, with an improvised vehicle veering across the polychrome desert, and part Huckleberry Finn, with a young runaway and an older, savvy guide.  We both (and that includes my husband, Mr. Macho, forced to watch an animal movie) were fascinated as Duma, his young master and an African sidekick make their way across desert, lion-filled savannah and crocodile-infested river.We both got around to seeing March of the Penguins last week and found Duma to be about 8x more fun, and probably less disturbing for kids, with a mature and satisfying ending to the young boy's sojourn with his wild friend. It certainly deserves to be a hit DVD.  Do see it if you like good scenery and wildlife.Duma will resonate especially with those who have been on safari.  It reminded me of visiting Kenya in 1999 and watching a pair of what our Swahili-speaking drivers called ""duma"" resting in a clearing.  They were a couple of cool customers, happy to lounge around surrounded by a half-dozen Toyotas with camping tops filled with amateur photographers.The ""Duma"" of this DVD moves around a lot more than the ones we saw on safari and appears to hit 60 mph in a few scenes.

No matter what your language, this is a movie worth buying and watching.A young boy and his father are returning home when they come upon a cheetah cub in the roadway. Lost and abandoned, they take the little fellow to their home where it proceeds to grow from a handful to a bed full. It was agreed when the cub was acquired that he would have to return to the wild at some time in the future. The boy's father becomes ill as that time approaches and dies before they can make it happen.Soon thereafter his mother announces they will have to lease their farm and move to the city. Duma makes the trip as well but the city is no place for the big cat as we are shown in a humorous and sometimes harrowing escapade when he comes visiting the boy's school.The movie has a few jumps of location thereafter without much, if any, explanation of how it was accomplished, but no matter, just accept it and move on.The rest of the story is about the trek to get Duma to the area he came from and it is quite a trek indeed.This is a gem of a story with magnificent photography which the entire family can enjoy and should, preferably together.

916401,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009XRZS8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","I readily admit that I am not a big animal lover, but director Carroll Ballard has made a solid example of a movie in which a boy grows up because of his relationship with the animal he loves.  There are a lot of these movies: sometimes the boy is a girl, and the animal can be just about anything you want from a traditional pet like a dog or just about any wild or exotic animal that you can name.  You can also make the location any place on Earth.  With ""Duma"" we have a story about a young boy whose has made a cheetah his pet, with the setting being South Africa (the northern part in fact).  Actually, the location matters more than the animal in this 2005 film, because the boy and the cheetah are joined for most of their journey by somebody else who becomes a key part of their grand adventure.After the death of its mother, a cheetah cub is found by young Xan (Alex Michaletos) and his father (Campbell Scott).  They live on a farm in South Africa and Xan raises the cub, who is eventually named Duma (much is made of finding the right name and the responsibility that comes from such an act).  Xan understands that the day will come when Duma will have to return to the wild, but circumstances force their separation much earlier than the boy anticipated.  Seeing the only alternative as being the death of Duma, Xan takes his father's motorcycle with its sidecar to get Duma back to the Kalahari Desert.  Of course, the journey will not be easy.  The immediate bad news is that the motorcycle runs out of case.  The good news is that Xan and Duma encounter Ripkuna (Eamonn Walker), who is wandering in the desert trying to find his way home to his own family.  Consequently, there are interpersonal dynamics at work between the trio that add depth to the story of Xan trying to get Duma back to his home in the wild.The film is based upon the autobiographical novel ""How It Was With Dooms"" by Xan Hopcraft and his mother Carol Cawthra Hopcraft, although I do not know enough to comment on how ""true"" what we see on the screen might be.  After all, there is a limited amount of direction that I would think you can give to a cheetah (or four different cheetahs as is the case in this film), and it is serendipity to get footage of one chasing after a gazelle.  I certainly wish there had been more opportunities to see the cheetah do its thing.  But there are only a couple of times that Duma gets to fun flat out at full speech (they can do 64 miles per hour for up to five hundred yards), and they are some of the most memorable sequences in the film.  The problem is that when Duma gets up to full speed, he leaves Xan far behind, and that would ruin the story.  The key relationship is obviously between Xan and Duma, but once they meet up the most significant interaction comes between Xan and Ripkuna.  For younger children who can watch such scenes and dream of having such adventures themselves ""Duma"" will be much more entertaining than for those of us who keeping thinking having a cheetah as a pet is a dangerous idea.",4,"A boy, his cheetah, and a stranger in the Kalhari Desert of South Africa",1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,3041,"['readily', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'animal', 'lover', 'director', 'Carroll', 'Ballard', 'made', 'solid', 'example', 'movie', 'boy', 'up', 'relationship', 'animal', 'are', 'lot', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'boy', 'girl', 'animal', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'anything', 'want', 'traditional', 'pet', 'dog', 'just', 'wild', 'exotic', 'animal', 'can', 'name', 'can', 'also', 'make', 'location', 'place', 'Earth', 'Duma', 'have', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'made', 'cheetah', 'pet', 'setting', 'being', 'South', 'Africa', 'northern', 'part', 'fact', 'Actually', 'location', 'matters', 'more', 'animal', '2005', 'film', 'boy', 'cheetah', 'are', 'joined', 'most', 'journey', 'somebody', 'else', 'who', 'key', 'part', 'grand', 'death', 'mother', 'cheetah', 'cub', 'found', 'young', 'Xan', 'Alex', 'Michaletos', 'father', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'live', 'farm', 'South', 'Africa', 'Xan', 'cub', 'who', 'eventually', 'named', 'Duma', 'much', 'made', 'finding', 'right', 'name', 'responsibility', 'such', 'act', 'Xan', 'day', 'will', 'come', 'when', 'Duma', 'will', 'have', 'return', 'wild', 'circumstances', 'force', 'separation', 'much', 'earlier', 'boy', 'anticipated', 'Seeing', 'only', 'alternative', 'being', 'death', 'Duma', 'Xan', 'father', 'motorcycle', 'sidecar', 'get', 'Duma', 'back', 'Kalahari', 'Desert', 'course', 'journey', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'immediate', 'bad', 'news', 'motorcycle', 'case', 'good', 'news', 'Xan', 'Duma', 'encounter', 'Ripkuna', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'who', 'wandering', 'desert', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'own', 'family', 'Consequently', 'are', 'interpersonal', 'dynamics', 'work', 'trio', 'depth', 'story', 'Xan', 'trying', 'get', 'Duma', 'back', 'home', 'wild.The', 'film', 'based', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'How', 'Was', 'Dooms', 'Xan', 'Hopcraft', 'mother', 'Carol', 'Cawthra', 'Hopcraft', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'enough', 'comment', 'how', 'true', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'might', 'be', 'limited', 'amount', 'direction', 'would', 'think', 'can', 'give', 'cheetah', 'four', 'different', 'cheetahs', 'case', 'film', 'serendipity', 'get', 'footage', 'one', 'chasing', 'gazelle', 'certainly', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'opportunities', 'see', 'cheetah', 'do', 'thing', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'times', 'Duma', 'fun', 'flat', 'out', 'full', 'speech', 'can', 'do', '64', 'miles', 'hour', 'five', 'hundred', 'yards', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'film', 'problem', 'when', 'Duma', 'up', 'full', 'speed', 'Xan', 'far', 'would', 'ruin', 'story', 'key', 'relationship', 'obviously', 'Xan', 'Duma', 'once', 'meet', 'up', 'most', 'significant', 'interaction', 'Xan', 'Ripkuna', 'younger', 'children', 'who', 'can', 'watch', 'such', 'scenes', 'dream', 'having', 'such', 'adventures', 'Duma', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'who', 'keeping', 'thinking', 'having', 'cheetah', 'pet', 'dangerous', 'idea']",Duma

916406,ABC8FXLD7W528,B0009XRZS8,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[1, 1]","Once in awhile, I come across a little-known movie that is, in my opinion, a ""must-see."" Duma is such a movie.Set in South Africa in the present day, 12-year-old Xan and his father nearly run over a baby cheetah while driving home on an empty stretch of highway one evening. They take the animal back to their South African farm and raise it as a pet. Xan mentions that when you give something a name, it then becomes your friend.  After trying to decide on a name, Xan finally decides to give his new pet the name of Duma, which is ""cheetah"" in Swahili. It isn't long before a wonderful friendship begins between Xan and Duma.One of the things I enjoyed most about this movie is the portrayal of Xan's closeknit family. Xan's dad, Peter, is sure to teach his son all he knows about building things and taking care of a farm (which comes in handy later in the movie). Peter spends a considerable amount of time with Xan and, together, they test Duma's speed by racing alongside the animal with a stopwatch.  There is also a strong love and devotion between Xan's parents, even when they are in the midst of tragedy.Duma is void of anything objectionable; however, there are several intense scenes that will frighten younger viewers. When Xan embarks on an adventurous journey and a promise he made to his father to return Duma to the wilds where he belongs, Xan encounters the harsh elements, wild animals, a stranger, and near death due to a lack of water and food. Parents will also want to discuss Xan's choice to leave on his own to help Duma find his way back to the wilds, rather than solicit his mom's help.Duma is one of those movies that I hadn't heard much about, but that I am glad I purchased. Themes of family unity, forgiveness, loyalty, loving your neighbor, and grief all play integral roles in this movie.

916416,ABBIURWJFRZKJ,B0009XRZS8,Stephen Foster,"[3, 3]","There are two levels to this movie. There's the hackneyed plot, obvious to any adult, albeit with some truly wonderful cinematography. You will not get bored watching it with your kid.Like the famous scene on the motorcycle, with the cheetah running along and the Dad calling out the numbers in astonishment, ending with: ""He's overtaking us!"" Yes, that's actually a cheetah running alongside a motorcycle at 80mph and more.And then there's the eyes of a 10 year-old like my son, who chilled upon imagining himself in the place of the young boy who, after finding the mewling cub by the road, turns to his dad and says: ""Do you know what those black lines on his face mean? He's a cheetah: the fastest animal in the world!""To actually be a small child, and own the rare, fer-sure fastest animal on the planet ... but of course, he doesn't. And therein lies the rub. And the plot.For some reason, one parent always has to die. I don't know why parents have to die in all good children's stories: I think it's most probably at the hands of lazy storytellers. But die they do. This death makes more sense than most, driving the discovery.You will see the hard times befall, and the incomprehensible (back to the child-eyes again) move to the city, with the cheetah in a high-rise, breaking out to rescue his buddy from school bullies. Total yawn, unless you are (say) ten, in a new school, have no power whatsoever, and would really like a friendly cheetah to show up round about NOW.And the flight to save the cat, into the deep, deep desert on Dad's old BMW motorbike, with the cheetah in the sidecar looking utterly domesticated and happy with technology. Which he is, for a while.And then there's an hour of unoriginal wilderness adventures, with the evil, mercenary bad guy showing up. Sure: you can see that he has a good heart, but your kid can't.And those child eyes don't see a hackneyed adventure. They see astonishing scenes of raw nature, trust broken, betrayal, abandonment (that last done by the kid), and a wild animal that he once thought was his forever.Sure, he also eventually sees his one surviving parent, but the relationship has permanently changed: the boy is growing up.Recommended.",4,Please judge by your own 10 year-old eyes - do you remember what they saw?,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,2204,"['are', 'two', 'levels', 'movie', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'obvious', 'adult', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'bored', 'watching', 'kid.Like', 'famous', 'scene', 'motorcycle', 'cheetah', 'running', 'along', 'Dad', 'calling', 'out', 'numbers', 'astonishment', 'ending', 'overtaking', 'Yes', 'actually', 'cheetah', 'running', 'alongside', 'motorcycle', '80mph', 'more.And', 'then', 'eyes', '10', 'year-old', 'son', 'who', 'chilled', 'imagining', 'place', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'finding', 'mewling', 'cub', 'road', 'dad', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'black', 'lines', 'face', 'mean', 'cheetah', 'fastest', 'animal', 'world', 'actually', 'be', 'small', 'child', 'own', 'rare', 'fer-sure', 'fastest', 'animal', 'planet', 'course', ""n't"", 'therein', 'rub', 'plot.For', 'reason', 'one', 'parent', 'always', 'die', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'parents', 'have', 'die', 'good', 'children', 'stories', 'think', 'most', 'probably', 'hands', 'lazy', 'storytellers', 'die', 'do', 'death', 'more', 'sense', 'most', 'driving', 'discovery.You', 'will', 'see', 'hard', 'times', 'befall', 'incomprehensible', 'back', 'child-eyes', 'again', 'move', 'city', 'cheetah', 'high-rise', 'breaking', 'out', 'rescue', 'buddy', 'school', 'bullies', 'Total', 'yawn', 'are', 'say', 'ten', 'new', 'school', 'have', 'power', 'whatsoever', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'friendly', 'cheetah', 'show', 'up', 'round', 'NOW.And', 'flight', 'save', 'cat', 'deep', 'deep', 'desert', 'Dad', 'old', 'BMW', 'motorbike', 'cheetah', 'sidecar', 'looking', 'utterly', 'domesticated', 'happy', 'technology', 'while.And', 'then', 'hour', 'unoriginal', 'wilderness', 'adventures', 'evil', 'mercenary', 'bad', 'guy', 'showing', 'up', 'Sure', 'can', 'see', 'good', 'heart', 'kid', ""can't.And"", 'child', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'hackneyed', 'adventure', 'see', 'astonishing', 'scenes', 'raw', 'nature', 'trust', 'broken', 'betrayal', 'abandonment', 'last', 'done', 'kid', 'wild', 'animal', 'once', 'thought', 'was', 'forever.Sure', 'also', 'eventually', 'one', 'surviving', 'parent', 'relationship', 'permanently', 'changed', 'boy', 'growing', 'up.Recommended']",Duma

916420,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B0009XRZS8,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[6, 9]","Even among movie buffs, Carroll Ballard is hardly a household name. The San Francisco Bay Area director has only made a few films in his long career (Wind, The Black Stallion, Fly Away Home), and most of them deal with nature themes, wild animals in particular. In 1983 he directed what I think is one of the greatest films of that decade, Never Cry Wolf. But this title has been all but ignored by parent studio Disney, who would rather milk tired animated DVD spinoffs of past hits.So it's sad to say that Ballard received equally dismal treatment by Warners, who backed the present film. This movie, about a cheetah, got spotty release (no pun intended) across the U.S., and Ballard was reportedly very wounded by this. The good news, if there is any, is that the transfer to home video is stunning, so much so that watching it on a 46"" LCD HDTV, I really felt as though I were in a movie theater.The film itself has some parallels to Never Cry Wolf, which I regard as Ballard's greatest masterpiece so far. In both we have a fish-out-of-water main character forced to survive in the throes of nature, with the help of a more well-adapted guide who nonetheless does not have entirely altruistic motivations. As with Never Cry Wolf, a brief narrative voiceover from the main character opens and closes the movie.Duma has many delights, most of them residing in the earlier part of the film. The discovery and raising of the cheetah are handled expertly and memorably, with a sweetness that is never saccharine. The atmosphere (in Ballards films, the locations are often stars in themselves) is rich. The acting is typically naturalistic and understated. And most outstandingly, I think, the death the boy's father early on is handled extremely tastefully. (And don't worry I am revealing spoilers, because it's really no secret that it's coming.) It was moving, yet I never felt the director tugging at my heartstrings a la Spielberg or Zemeckis. At this point I was thinking here was another masterpiece on a par with Never Cry Wolf.However, in the second half things fall off somewhat. This is still a fine movie, but later scenes are more conventional and do not live up to the high bar set earlier. Some of the plot becomes a bit contrived. A scene where the hungry boy and his dreadlocked friend steal some food from an outdoor banquet by way of a fake snake bite made me wince; it was staged like a moment from a TV sitcom. There is maybe a bit too much anthropomorphizing. And although there are moments of peril as we near the climax, I was never in doubt that all would turn out okay. That's my biggest problem with the movie, in fact: overall there's little conflict, and no real loss, in the third act. In Never Cry Wolf there is a tremendous loss at the end--the parent wolves are slaughtered and the pups are left as orphans, and despite what some reviews state, we never find out for certain who killed the wolves, which is the key issue the whole movie revolves around. (A lot of critics, even fanatically positive ones, missed that essential point, and assumed the Brian Dennehy character was definitely the bad guy. A careful viewing of the film shows that is not the case.) In Duma there's no equivalent moment of grief, of revelation, of change, of anything. The last act is a bit flat.To top it off, while the closing monologue in Never Cry Wolf was brilliant, here the boy comes back and in a few brief lines spoon-feeds us the very thoughts we should have left with on our own. I *hate* it when filmmakers do that. (Something similar mars the ending of Peter Bogdanovitch's The Cat's Meow, a film, that, despite the title, is not about animals.) And frankly, I would have rolled credits a few shots earlier, back in the village, and let the audience fill in the blanks to the ultimate outcome themselves.All this isn't to say ""Don't rent this film."" It is a fine movie and better than 95% of the dreck out there. I'm just a little disappointed that what could have been a masterpiece was only a ""good"" film, marred by some uninspired moments and an ending that could have been re-thought a little. Duma certainly deserved a better fate than...well, almost no fate at all, save that it went almost instantly to DVD. I wonder if studios will ever wake up to the unique talents of Carroll Ballard. I doubt it. The Hollywood system is just not geared for his type of work, and neither, ironically, is what little is left of the ""independent"" film scene.The DVD lacks much in the way of extras. Just two extended scenes and the theatrical trailer. Someday I hope Criterion or somebody does a ""best of Carroll Ballard"" collection with extras, commentaries, behind-the-scenes interviews (you do wonder how he stages some of the animal scenes) and deleted footage. Still, fine as this movie is, if you've never seen any Carroll Ballard film, I urge you to start with Never Cry Wolf, which just may blow you away. Then check out Duma, Fly Away Home, and The Black Stallion, keeping in mind that fine as they are, they aren't quite of the same caliber. Then you can wonder, as I do, why the world doesn't wake up to what a great storyteller and filmmaker Ballard is.",4,"A sweet, gentle film (but not quite the masterpiece it could have

I was happy to be proved wrong. Another thing I was pleased to discover is that ""Duma"" is more of a survival adventure than a kid's animal movie. Yes, we have the kid's pet cheetah, and also an accidental pet bushbaby (or galago), but the film's more about the two main characters than the animals.The two characters happen to be Xan (short for Alexander), a South African boy who takes off from home to release his pet cheetah into the wild. The other character is Ripkuna (Eamonn Walker ), an African drifter trying to find out where he belongs in the world after some bad experiences. This relationship is the core of the picture. For a brief period of time these two stumble on to each other and it's a fortuitous meeting because they both have something the other needs, at least for the present.The cheetah, the galago and the other numerous animals are great too, as are the awesome African visuals (shot in South Africa and bordering Botswana), but it's Xan and Ripkuna's relationship that gives the film depth and makes it absorbing. This makes up for a couple of eye-rolling parts, like the part where Xan is saved from some bullies.So ""Duma"" provides the best of three worlds: amazing animals, awe-inspiring geography and some potent lessons to chew on.The film runs 100 minutes.GRADE: B+",4,A survival adventure with riches to mine... and a cheetah,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,1428,"['put', 'off', 'seeing', 'Duma', '2005', 'even', 'like', 'occasional', 'animal', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Duma', 'have', 'depth', 'was', 'happy', 'be', 'proved', 'wrong', 'thing', 'was', 'pleased', 'discover', 'Duma', 'more', 'survival', 'adventure', 'kid', 'animal', 'movie', 'Yes', 'have', 'kid', 'pet', 'cheetah', 'also', 'accidental', 'pet', 'bushbaby', 'galago', 'film', 'more', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'animals.The', 'two', 'characters', 'happen', 'be', 'Xan', 'short', 'Alexander', 'South', 'African', 'boy', 'who', 'home', 'release', 'pet', 'cheetah', 'wild', 'other', 'character', 'Ripkuna', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'African', 'drifter', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'world', 'bad', 'experiences', 'relationship', 'core', 'picture', 'brief', 'period', 'time', 'two', 'stumble', 'other', 'fortuitous', 'meeting', 'have', 'something', 'other', 'needs', 'least', 'present.The', 'cheetah', 'galago', 'other', 'numerous', 'animals', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'are', 'awesome', 'African', 'visuals', 'shot', 'South', 'Africa', 'bordering', 'Botswana', 'Xan', 'Ripkuna', 'relationship', 'film', 'depth', 'absorbing', 'up', 'couple', 'eye-rolling', 'parts', 'part', 'where', 'Xan', 'saved', 'bullies.So', 'Duma', 'best', 'three', 'worlds', 'amazing', 'animals', 'awe-inspiring', 'geography', 'potent', 'lessons', 'chew', 'on.The', 'film', '100', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B+']",Duma
