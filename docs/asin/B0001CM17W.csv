This movie stars Tom Conti who plays a washed up alcoholic poet and yet for some obscure reason EVERY woman he meets wants to have sex with him!!! In reality a fine looking woman like Kelly McGillis would not even give this drunk the time of day but in this movie she falls for his charms whatever they may be.This drunk is so stupid that he is having sex with his dentist's wife and yet he goes to to the guy to have some dental work done!!! Is that a recipe for asking for pain or what?This is a very pitiful excuse for a movie which I feel may have influenced a whole Legion of young men out there to pick up the bottle in the sadly mistaken belief that when they are dunk they are irresistable to women. Sadly this happens every Saturday night at your local bar!!!",5,I'm A Drunk BUT I Get To Have Sex With Lotsa Women!!!,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,897,"['Watching', 'movie', 'immense', 'Suspension', 'Disbelief', 'part', 'viewer', 'could', 'not', 'quite', 'accomplish', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Conti', 'who', 'washed', 'up', 'alcoholic', 'poet', 'yet', 'obscure', 'reason', 'EVERY', 'woman', 'have', 'sex', 'reality', 'fine', 'looking', 'woman', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'give', 'drunk', 'time', 'day', 'movie', 'charms', 'may', 'be.This', 'drunk', 'so', 'stupid', 'having', 'sex', 'dentist', 'wife', 'yet', 'guy', 'have', 'dental', 'work', 'done', 'recipe', 'asking', 'pain', 'what', 'very', 'pitiful', 'excuse', 'movie', 'feel', 'may', 'have', 'influenced', 'whole', 'Legion', 'young', 'men', 'there', 'pick', 'up', 'bottle', 'sadly', 'mistaken', 'belief', 'when', 'are', 'are', 'irresistable', 'women', 'Sadly', 'Saturday', 'night', 'local', 'bar']","Reuben, Reuben"
