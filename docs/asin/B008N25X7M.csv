The title refers to a street where an older French man finds a young hunk passed out on the street. The young man turns out to be much more than just a drunk looking for his next drink. And the older man is equally interesting. They have a brief sexual relationship in Paris, and that seems the end of the story, but it is not.

The only problem is that one of them is a big Hollywood actor who is afraid of committing because it would hurt his career.

Clay ""drakkar91""","[3, 5]","Unconventional, Yet Very Realistic Film Set in ParisLike some other viewers, I was expecting more ""bad"" and less storyline, but what I got was a very real portrayal of two lives intersected unexpectedly and unconventionally.  Unlike another recently viewed film dealing with a troubled relationship, in Bad Boy Street, I can really connect with all the characters.  They are genuine and believable, and I connected very much with Claude.  In many ways, it's a film about finding love when (and with whom) you least expect it.  Without revealing too much, let's say our dear handsome American Brad has far more going on in his life than innocent Claude is aware of. I would suspect it was created with a small budget, but it delivers high-budget appeal, in all aspects of the production.Some of the filming is so absolutely delightful, especially some featuring the views from Claude's Paris home. It's more about finding love (at least for the weekend, but hoping for more) and much less about sex, though the scenes are tasteful and tactful.  It's about people connecting, and wine, and flowers, and waiting for that 'new guy you just met' to come dashing through the door to sweep you off your feet (again). It's about taking care of someone in need, and we could certainly use more of that in this world.Well done and certainly recommended viewing!",4,"Unconventional, Yet Very Realistic Film Set in Paris",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1351,"['Unconventional', 'Yet', 'Very', 'Realistic', 'Film', 'Set', 'ParisLike', 'other', 'viewers', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'bad', 'less', 'storyline', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'portrayal', 'two', 'lives', 'intersected', 'unexpectedly', 'unconventionally', 'recently', 'viewed', 'film', 'dealing', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Street', 'can', 'really', 'connect', 'characters', 'are', 'genuine', 'believable', 'connected', 'very', 'much', 'Claude', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'finding', 'love', 'when', 'whom', 'least', 'expect', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'let', 'say', 'dear', 'handsome', 'American', 'Brad', 'far', 'more', 'going', 'life', 'innocent', 'Claude', 'aware', 'would', 'suspect', 'was', 'created', 'small', 'budget', 'high-budget', 'appeal', 'aspects', 'production.Some', 'filming', 'so', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'especially', 'featuring', 'views', 'Claude', 'Paris', 'home', 'more', 'finding', 'love', 'least', 'weekend', 'hoping', 'more', 'much', 'less', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'tasteful', 'tactful', 'people', 'connecting', 'wine', 'flowers', 'waiting', ""'new"", 'guy', 'just', 'met', 'come', 'dashing', 'door', 'sweep', 'off', 'feet', 'again', 'taking', 'care', 'someone', 'need', 'could', 'certainly', 'use', 'more', 'world.Well', 'done', 'certainly', 'recommended', 'viewing']",N/A

After an unpromising beginning, where one  of the characters was scooped up out of the gutter and taken home, I would really like to know how little Claude dragged Brad/Aaron up all those stairs and then up a spiral stairs to the bedroom !? It must have been worth it all. And of course Claude fell in love and there it seemed to end.But ain't love grand? Love will not be denied and there is the inevitable reunion and from the closing scene, alarm off, and Brad appears to be staying--for how long? That's in the laps of the gods--Brad would be even more dense than he has appeared in the film if he doesn't get the vibes and Claude should tell him how he feels. Now. Immediatment!I thought that the film was well done. The characters were well developed, and suited the parts they were given.

Something Gay for desperately isolated gay people could be another...Claude is a handsome young Frenchman, in his thirties.  Brad is a handsome young American in his twenties----with a curious on-again-off-again French accent.  Claude works in an office but we're not sure exactly what he does, but it's a pretty office.  We're not supposed to know what Brad does until half way through the film, although I'll tell you about half way through this review, with ample large print warning.Claude and Brad meet in a bar.  No no.  Claude and Brad meet high in the turrets of Notre Dame.  No no no.  Claude and Brad literally bump into each other on one of those old Parisian buses where you board through the rear, it's crowded and they are jammed together and they meet and...  No.Judging by the light, it's about 7 in the morning and Brad is passed out on a sidewalk of a side street in Pigalle.  Claude finds Brad, and knowing he's just won the Stud Jackpot, he helps him up and maneuvers him to his apartment, up several flights of narrow Parisian stairs, up a circular stair case, and strips him naked off camera (naturally, off camera).  He then washes his clothes, and then, being a gentleman, goes to bed, by himself, downstairs.Yes, this really happens.Brad wakes up, naked in bed, very quietly gets up, goes down stairs with nothing but a pillow about him, looks out the window giving us a great shot of his naked backside, and then finds some aspirin powder which he dissolves  and drinks, and then, murders Claude, steals his money and lives it up with his Albanian floozy.No that doesn't happen.  Brad gently wakes Claude by going down on him.So they spend some time together, Brad being ever mysterious, and then Brad has to go, but suggests dinner, later, so Claude's gal pal upstairs fixes one and Brad never shows.  Then he shows later (although by now it seems to be daylight, has the midnight sun has rolled out of the Norway and into Paris?)  But Claude is passed out drunk, so he gets naked and gets in to bed with him...Fast forward to where they get out of the shower together, and Claude's gal pal has snuck his friends in for a surprise birthday party and out they come in towels---um Brad and Claude and...SPOILER ALERTWe learn that Brad isn't actually Brad, he's an American Movie Star that Claude's friends recognize, so he runs upstairs, dresses, and runs downstairs, and runs off.Well, on the positive side, nobody dies in this film.  It used to be that one of the gay characters had to die to get the film out of the censor's office.Of course, why would a movie star of a stature to be recognizable abroad pass out in a Parisian gutter, and his handlers don't do anything?One can imagine this happening to Justin Bieber though, and some old troll finding him,  taking him home (probably over his shoulder) and....  Given his trajectory, this might be his next move, who knows?  Would we be surprised?  Would we care?  Oh sure, you'd want to be the troll, we knew that...Sigh.  Yes, I suppose if you're in the wilds of homophobic America, or perhaps in San Francisco with a devoutly religious self hating gay boyfriend who won't let you go out in public unless it's with him, to church and gay reversal clinic, this might be your movie.  Or you watch anything Gay, in which case you've probably seen worse.Yes, I think it's even worse than anything by Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell, and for me, that's saying something.",2,A Film So Bad It Encourages The Film Maker In All Of Us.

The wonderfully sublime but poignant performances of Yann de Monterno and Florence d'Az&eacute;mar as two lonely and devoted friends anchors this quiet romantic delight.  But it is famed French film/TV actor, Kevin Miranda of 'Hollywood Girls' who brings unintended spark and impassioned intensity to Claude's (de Monterno) mundane existence and bountiful eye candy to the film itself.  This is not breakthrough story telling and deficiencies in the film and its production is soon forgotten when the story zeros in on the dichotomy of the accidental lovers, intimate raw scenes of the two and the mystery veiled with character of Brad (Miranda).  Verow's jab at American 3D films' popularity is a hoot.

I think maybe he lives in Maine, yet depending on your P.O.V., his many previous made-in-the-U.S.A. movies are either boldly edgy or arty trash, whichever, not New England-like in the least. But please forget all that completely.  Here he's whipped up (No, not literally.  It's not that kind of movie.) a light-as-a-feather French fantasy fluff flick.  (No, not that kind of fluff, either. Think ""fluff"" as in un-serious stuff or fun and French, as in both the language and a distinctive style, but absolutely not high fashion, either. The French can do low-brow, too, you know. Really. And nothing particularly naughty here at all.)This movie is pure escape, totally improbable on every level, but to pick it apart would be like reading the ingredients on a junk food label. You really don't want to go there. Just shut up and enjoy a pleasant enough 80 minute layover in Paris.If you insist on getting all intellectual and meta about the whole thing, you could say Todd Verow is playing with a genre of French made-for-TV romance movies popular amongst cleaning ladies and similar folk.  But that would be to miss the whole point of the thing, which is simply to be entertained. I must admit Verow got me good with the little amusement he devised for our pleasure.  When I watched--and found myself liking it, sort of in spite of myself--I didn't know who'd made it. I assumed it really was some B-grade flick maybe recycled from a French equivalent of the Logo channel.  They are so fiercely egalitarian in France about things like television, it makes sense there would be TV movies made specifically with the homosexual blue collar audience in mind.  It's only fair, after all. Likewise, why give an acting job to a foreigner when so many French actors are unemployed? This would explain why the guy who is supposed to be a huge U.S. movie star (like Brad Pitt huge) is so obviously French (you can always tell by their jeans, uh, with a 'j.'), nobody from the States would ever believe for an instant he's a real American.
