930564,A3O6E41H4V1TMN,B000AP31I8,A&M Junkie,"[56, 58]","The back-cover of volume 1 of this fantastic series has the following words:""Sitting astride the backOf an internal combustion companion-Drifting through the beautiful world.The ground rolling beneath, before and beyond:Their journey meanders""For me this sums up the atmosphere of ""Kino's journey"" - this is a poetic, but unpretenious series. The viewer follows Kino, a young girl, and her motoraide as they drift from country to country, staying three days in each to soak up the culture and understand the ways of the people that live within them. Each country is vastly different with extremely different political, technological, and moral standards.The series manages something rarely attainable in anime - interesting, mysterious, and intelligent storylines that make the viewer really think about the world around them, but without being overly complex and confusing. The makers of ther series also do not force their viewpoints on the viewer; instead the makers present the information and leave the viewer to judge the standards of each country themselves.  The series also benefits from having a truly likeable heroine, who is not girly but worldly and capable.This may sound boring, but believe me it is not.  After the second episode, I was as eager as Kino to visit the next country and uncover their culture. The stories are genuinely moving, unpredictable, and sometimes heartbreaking. There is action as Kino sometimes finds herself in danger and some unexpected brutal images. The graphics are beautiful and modern. The soundtrack and dubbing are excellent.This is not a funny or romantic series and there are no mecha battles. However, if you want to try a series (13 episodes) that treats the viewer with some intelligence and is genuinely interesting that you should definitely buy this.  Similiar to Haibane Renmei in tone and graphics, but  more down-to-earth.  I watched the whole series in one day and afterwards felt like packing a bag and invesitgating the world myself.",4,Enthralling & beautiful series,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,1996,"['back-cover', 'volume', '1', 'fantastic', 'series', 'following', 'words', 'Sitting', 'backOf', 'internal', 'combustion', 'companion-Drifting', 'beautiful', 'world.The', 'ground', 'rolling', 'beneath', 'journey', 'meanders', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'Kino', 'journey', 'poetic', 'unpretenious', 'series', 'viewer', 'Kino', 'young', 'girl', 'motoraide', 'drift', 'country', 'country', 'staying', 'three', 'days', 'soak', 'up', 'culture', 'understand', 'ways', 'people', 'live', 'country', 'vastly', 'different', 'extremely', 'different', 'political', 'technological', 'moral', 'standards.The', 'series', 'something', 'rarely', 'attainable', 'anime', 'interesting', 'mysterious', 'intelligent', 'storylines', 'make', 'viewer', 'really', 'think', 'world', 'being', 'overly', 'complex', 'confusing', 'makers', 'ther', 'series', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'force', 'viewpoints', 'viewer', 'instead', 'makers', 'present', 'information', 'leave', 'viewer', 'judge', 'standards', 'country', 'series', 'also', 'benefits', 'having', 'truly', 'likeable', 'heroine', 'who', 'not', 'girly', 'worldly', 'capable.This', 'may', 'sound', 'boring', 'believe', 'not', 'second', 'episode', 'was', 'as', 'eager', 'Kino', 'visit', 'next', 'country', 'uncover', 'culture', 'stories', 'are', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'unpredictable', 'sometimes', 'heartbreaking', 'action', 'Kino', 'sometimes', 'danger', 'unexpected', 'brutal', 'images', 'graphics', 'are', 'beautiful', 'modern', 'soundtrack', 'dubbing', 'are', 'excellent.This', 'not', 'funny', 'romantic', 'series', 'are', 'mecha', 'battles', 'However', 'want', 'try', 'series', '13', 'episodes', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'should', 'definitely', 'buy', 'Similiar', 'Haibane', 'Renmei', 'tone', 'graphics', 'more', 'down-to-earth', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'one', 'day', 'afterwards', 'felt', 'packing', 'bag', 'invesitgating', 'world']",N/A

Just reading about it, the story sounds strange but once you start watching it, it makes sense in the world it takes place in. The world Kino lives in is almost like our own, except that each country Kino visits seems to be at a different stage of civilization. You could say Kino's world was tailor made just for us to learn the moral lessons it's trying to teach. Through Kino's journey we come face to face with human desires that can either lead a country into destruction or into a new age of change. Our main character is Kino who is unflinching in her resolve to continue her journey and tries to keep herself uninvolved from the fate of those people she meets. It is refreshing to finally see a character that isn't so self-righteous to think she has the answers for everybody's problems. Kino's motorcycle Hermes is a good vehicle for seeing the puzzling world from a non-human perspective. None of the character designs are particularly attractive nor does the animation impress any veteran anime viewer.

930568,A2ICKE6A3MJMM5,B000AP31I8,E. L. Green,"[2, 2]","The mysterious stranger coming to town is a trope that has been around for eons. Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns of the 1960's are a perfect example. The mysterious stranger comes to town, and nothing's the same again.Kino is the mysterious stranger here, though she rarely changes the towns she enters. Kino travels from town to town on her talking motorcycle, Hermes, experiencing the different civilizations on her world. She stays three days and two nights, then leaves. Kino is a mystery, even her gender is a mystery for the first few episodes. She doesn't act like a stereotypical boy, or a stereotypical girl, she's Kino, as she reminds people who call her ""little boy"" or ""little girl"" (she's around 15 in the books, and presumably around the same age here, but she's a small person regardless of her age). We're told something of her background, of how she fled her home town when another mysterious stranger gave his life for her, of how she was trained in martial arts and weapons by a mysterious figure known only as ""Master"", but Kino is an enigma. Why is she traveling? What does she hope to accomplish? Where is she going? We're never told, though we can guess reasons why she may be traveling based on clues in the series.Kino is kick-ass but not showy about it. She is a quiet person who speaks softly and politely. She is a crack shot and also a collector of knives and to a certain extent embodies the ""small girl, big gun"" trope but rarely shoots except when absolutely necessary for survival, and most episodes never pulls her guns except to practice in the mirror or to clean them in her hotel room. She can be kind, she helps several people that she encounters in her travels, but she is also a dispassionate observer who rarely tries to intervene in anything big. Sometimes she does intervene, but her interventions are typically small -- there is none of the pyrotechnics of something like Eastwood's ""High Plains Drifter"" for the most part. Even the most action-filled episodes where she kills someone (there are three episodes out of thirteen where she kills someone), the killing is a shock simply because it is so out of the norm for this series.The result is oddly touching. Kino can take care of herself, she is tough and resilient, but you want to give her a hug from time to time when she encounters things that are disturbing. Kino rarely displays any outward emotion when encountering disturbing things, and makes only occasional objections when she runs across true atrocities, but you the viewer are more likely to be disturbed than Kino. She accepts the world as it is, not as she may wish it to be, with a stoicism devoid of cynicism, and somehow that makes this series even more disturbing.Definitely not easy viewing, it's a psychological series rather than an action series (there are some scenes of shocking violence, but they are few and far between, which is perhaps why they seem so shocking despite being tame by modern-day standards) and intended more to make you think and feel than as mindless entertainment. There's no fan service here and no big fighting robots or anything like that. No real plot -- for the most part Kino travels to a country, interacts with the citizens, learns disturbing things, moves on. No easy answers either -- each episode will raise questions, but you'll have to provide answers yourself. If there are any. Still, if you're in the right mindset, definitely a rewarding series to watch, and will leave you wanting more -- more backstory, more opportunities for growth on the part of Kino (note that the episodes are *not* in chronological order though they are in the correct order for the purposes of the original author), more of watching Kino interact with the world and trying to make sense of it, and maybe Kino eventually being able to answer for herself why she is travelling and what she hopes to accomplish.

There really isn't a main story here; basically, Kino rides around to different countries on her talking motorcycle, Hermes. Some people felt that in the english dub Hermes sounded like a pedophile, though I thought he sounded more like a chain smoker, but that's beside the point. I watched some episodes in Japanese with English subtitles, and other episodes with the English dub, and I could go either way as this series has probably one of the better English anime dubs. I watched the series in order, but you really don't have to, as the episodes can be watched in whatever order you wish to watch them in, for the most part (except for 6 and 7, as those are a 2-part episode). In that way, it is a lot like an American TV show, as it really does make very little difference what order you watch the episodes in.Overall, while some episodes are better than others, I enjoyed the series and there were some very interesting countries that Kino explores with some very amusing, interesting, and bizarre customs. In this way the series does an excellent job in making the point that while in one society, certain actions might be considered strange, taboo, or reprehensible, in another culture they could be perfectly acceptable, or even the status quo. Most of the storylines also contain a twist at the end, which could be similar to a Twilight Zone twist. Many of these twists are easy to see coming, while others are unexpected, but they're not illogical and in no way nullify what went on in the story.The DVD I got is the slimpack edition, which is nice because the series is only on three discs, and it doesn't take up much space at all. This edition has absolutely no special features whatsover other than some previews on the first disc, which isn't a huge deal to me as I buy DVDs for the movie primarily and special features are a secondary concern, though some people might have a problem with that. It doesn't have one of ADV's best transfers, as I started noticing horizontal lines along the picture on the second and third disc, though the sound quality is okay.Overall, for the price tag, it would probably be worth it for you to check out if you're interested. As with any other episodic series (whether anime or otherwise), some of the episodes are going to be better than others, and in this series some of the episodes do seem to run a bit longer than they probably should have, given the kinds of stories it's telling, but it's still worth viewing.",4,"Overall, pretty decent series",1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,2622,"['would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'found', 'lot', 'storylines', 'be', 'amusing', 'intriguing', 'really', ""n't"", 'main', 'story', 'here', 'basically', 'Kino', 'different', 'countries', 'talking', 'motorcycle', 'Hermes', 'people', 'felt', 'english', 'dub', 'Hermes', 'sounded', 'pedophile', 'thought', 'sounded', 'more', 'chain', 'smoker', 'beside', 'point', 'watched', 'episodes', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'other', 'episodes', 'English', 'dub', 'could', 'go', 'either', 'way', 'series', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'English', 'anime', 'dubs', 'watched', 'series', 'order', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'order', 'wish', 'watch', 'most', 'part', '6', '7', 'are', '2-part', 'episode', 'way', 'lot', 'American', 'TV', 'show', 'really', 'make', 'very', 'little', 'difference', 'what', 'order', 'watch', 'episodes', 'in.Overall', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'countries', 'Kino', 'very', 'amusing', 'interesting', 'bizarre', 'customs', 'way', 'series', 'excellent', 'job', 'making', 'point', 'one', 'society', 'certain', 'actions', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'strange', 'taboo', 'reprehensible', 'culture', 'could', 'be', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'even', 'status', 'quo', 'Most', 'storylines', 'also', 'contain', 'twist', 'end', 'could', 'be', 'similar', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'twist', 'Many', 'twists', 'are', 'easy', 'see', 'coming', 'others', 'are', 'unexpected', ""'re"", 'not', 'illogical', 'way', 'nullify', 'what', 'went', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'got', 'slimpack', 'edition', 'nice', 'series', 'only', 'three', 'discs', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'much', 'space', 'edition', 'absolutely', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'previews', 'first', 'disc', ""n't"", 'huge', 'deal', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'movie', 'primarily', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'secondary', 'concern', 'people', 'might', 'have', 'problem', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'ADV', 'best', 'transfers', 'started', 'noticing', 'horizontal', 'lines', 'picture', 'second', 'third', 'disc', 'sound', 'quality', 'okay.Overall', 'price', 'tag', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'worth', 'check', 'out', ""'re"", 'interested', 'other', 'episodic', 'series', 'anime', 'otherwise', 'episodes', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'better', 'others', 'series', 'episodes', 'do', 'seem', 'run', 'bit', 'longer', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'kinds', 'stories', 'telling', 'still', 'worth', 'viewing']",N/A

Unfortunately there isn't much in the way of secondary characters. every once in a while Kino will stop somewhere and get involved in peoples lives and sometimes even get attached, but for the most part you meet one person and then never see them again. The only secondary character you can possibly feel for is Lilly in the last episode and that's just because she reminds you of Kino in a way. the rest are just there to move Kino's story forward, which isn't bad par say but can get annoying at times.The movie is full of somber moments from the opening episodes when Kino tries to help out a few starving men to when we finally get to see her past, but it is also full of hummer. I busted out laughing at parts that weren't necessarily meant to be funny. for example there is a part in the movie when one country thinks the world is going to end and one person tells Kino ""you know your stay here will coincide with the end of the world, are you okay with that?"" to which Hermees replies ""I can not believe she just asked us that."" the entire episode is really, REALLY funny and can not be missed. I don't' think that it was going for hummer, maybe it was going for a commentary on religion, but hummer is what I got out of it.Also latter there is a part where Kino helps a young woman in a town build her flying machine. The girl goes ""o thank you Kino, thank you thank you thank you"" and than knock Kino to the floor with a big hug. The camera stays still so we can't se them, and Hermees says ""now this is where it gets interesting."" maybe you have to see that part to get it, but once you do you'll see what I mean, its soooooo funny.Some of the countries are very interesting from the one that maintains its peace by playing terrible war games with its enemies, to the one that has gladiator type battles for the amusement of its king. These are very depressing countries and Kino even gets involved in one, but as I said she never stays for more than three days. But there are some really funny countries too. The one where people hop around like cats comes to mind.and i have to say that the English dub is top notch. Very few dubs can match this one in quality, almost every character, main and secondary, are perfectly done. Kudos.THE BAD - as a said before there aren't really a lot of secondary characters that you can like. They are mostly just a bunch of random people that you will never see again in the series. You don't learn many of their names and wouldn't remember what they were afterwards. The exception is Lilly in the last episode, but she is only in one episode too. Also the more somber moments in the film could have benefited from a stronger soundtrack. Maybe I'm just spoiled because I've been watching Myazaki movies too much but loud classical music during a slaughter of hundreds of woman and children didn't get me into a very sad mood. The very ending is very sad, but could have been much better.BOTTOM LINE - kinos journey is a very good film that deserves to be watched by any anime fan. If you are an amime fan there is really no excuse for you not to watch this movie, it isn't that expensive after all. And even if you aren't an anime fan I think you would like this film. There is a little bit of everything in this movie and whatever you like you'll find some of it. At times it can be funny, others bizarre and surreal, and at other times it can be almost heartbreaking. There is action, adventure, not much romance but there is a little, hope, despair, you name it and it's got it. If you like adventure stories you'll like this movie, flaws and all. if you read this review, please leave a comment.",4,the Japanese pilgrims progress,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,4391,"['Kinos', 'journey', 'odd', 'film', 'young', 'traveler', 'who', 'country', 'country', 'spending', 'never', 'more', 'three', 'days', 'many', 'adventures', 'way', 'talking', 'motorcycle', 'Hermees', 'who', 'kind', 'witty', 'really', 'funny', 'times', 'parts', 'fairy', 'tale', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'gruesome', 'disturbing', 'most', 'lighthearted', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'lines', 'ofNow', 'Then', 'Here', 'Complete', 'Collector', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'instead', 'got', 'something', 'more', 'likePorco', 'Rossoand', 'tiny', 'bit', 'ofGrave', 'Fireflies.THE', 'GOOD', 'first', 'main', 'characters', 'Kino', 'Hermees', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'dialog', 'other', 'just', 'eth', 'way', 'two', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'would', 'talk', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'secondary', 'characters', 'once', 'while', 'Kino', 'will', 'stop', 'somewhere', 'get', 'involved', 'peoples', 'lives', 'sometimes', 'even', 'get', 'attached', 'most', 'part', 'meet', 'one', 'person', 'then', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'only', 'secondary', 'character', 'can', 'possibly', 'feel', 'Lilly', 'last', 'episode', 'just', 'Kino', 'way', 'rest', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'move', 'Kino', 'story', 'forward', ""n't"", 'bad', 'par', 'say', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'times.The', 'movie', 'full', 'somber', 'moments', 'opening', 'episodes', 'when', 'Kino', 'help', 'out', 'few', 'starving', 'men', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'past', 'also', 'full', 'hummer', 'busted', 'out', 'laughing', 'parts', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'example', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'one', 'country', 'world', 'going', 'end', 'one', 'person', 'Kino', 'know', 'stay', 'here', 'will', 'coincide', 'end', 'world', 'are', 'Hermees', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'just', 'asked', 'entire', 'episode', 'really', 'REALLY', 'funny', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'do', ""n't"", ""'"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'hummer', 'maybe', 'was', 'going', 'commentary', 'religion', 'hummer', 'what', 'got', 'it.Also', 'latter', 'part', 'where', 'Kino', 'young', 'woman', 'town', 'build', 'flying', 'machine', 'girl', 'o', 'thank', 'Kino', 'thank', 'thank', 'thank', 'knock', 'Kino', 'floor', 'big', 'hug', 'camera', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'se', 'Hermees', 'now', 'where', 'interesting', 'maybe', 'have', 'see', 'part', 'get', 'once', 'do', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'soooooo', 'funny.Some', 'countries', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'one', 'peace', 'playing', 'terrible', 'war', 'games', 'enemies', 'one', 'gladiator', 'type', 'battles', 'amusement', 'king', 'are', 'very', 'depressing', 'countries', 'Kino', 'even', 'involved', 'one', 'said', 'never', 'more', 'three', 'days', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'countries', 'too', 'one', 'where', 'people', 'hop', 'cats', 'mind.and', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'English', 'dub', 'top', 'notch', 'Very', 'few', 'dubs', 'can', 'match', 'one', 'quality', 'almost', 'character', 'main', 'secondary', 'are', 'perfectly', 'done', 'Kudos.THE', 'BAD', 'said', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'lot', 'secondary', 'characters', 'can', 'like', 'are', 'mostly', 'just', 'bunch', 'random', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'many', 'names', 'would', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'were', 'afterwards', 'exception', 'Lilly', 'last', 'episode', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'too', 'Also', 'more', 'somber', 'moments', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'stronger', 'soundtrack', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'spoiled', 'because', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Myazaki', 'movies', 'too', 'much', 'loud', 'classical', 'music', 'slaughter', 'hundreds', 'woman', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'sad', 'mood', 'very', 'ending', 'very', 'sad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'kinos', 'journey', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'anime', 'fan', 'are', 'amime', 'fan', 'really', 'excuse', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', ""n't"", 'expensive', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'anime', 'fan', 'think', 'would', 'like', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'others', 'bizarre', 'surreal', 'other', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'almost', 'heartbreaking', 'action', 'adventure', 'not', 'much', 'romance', 'little', 'hope', 'despair', 'name', 'got', 'like', 'adventure', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'flaws', 'read', 'review', 'please', 'leave', 'comment']",N/A

930575,A39CBCM8WHDOSV,B000AP31I8,Kelly,"[1, 1]","Firstly, Kino is an immensely enjoyable character. Her voice isn't the annoying shrillness so common for young girls and what she says is always interesting or amusing. Kino alone makes this series enjoyable enough. Happily though, that is not all this series has to offer.Secondly, while each episode is a separate plot, there is an undertone of coming full circle in the beginning and end of the series, which only adds to the somewhat dreamlike tone that the series tends to adopt. Each episode has a different issue, one is about the justification of war and another is about a town in which people can hear each others thoughts and another is about a gladiator-esque fighting arena.Thirdly, the animation is exquisite. I have yet to see another style like it, and I want to see more. I don't always enjoy the seemingly random animation that comes with the humor of anime (Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood comes to mind) and that sort of over exaggeration didn't occur in Kino's Journey. It was very serious, but could be lighthearted when it wished.All in all, this is the sort of anime that (as well as being entertaining) is as much art as it is entertainment.

The complete series is only 13 episodes long, but rather than the usual extended storyline, Kino's Journey is made up of distinct standalone episodes, each of them seeing the traveller Kino with speaking motorrad Hermes arriving in a new country in an alternate world where the laws that govern society are very different from our own and from one another.One thing that almost all the countries have in common is that they welcome travellers visiting their country - a fairly infrequent occurrence - and are keen to explain how their society works and show them around. Not in every case - occasionally, the country that Kino visits has been subjected to profound changes caused by experiments on consciousness or technology, that leaves them paranoid not just of outsiders, but of each other. These are interesting fables - a world where each person can read the others' minds, a world where mechanical dolls look and act exactly like humans - but, compressed into 20 minutes of fairly static scenes, they don't really explore the issues raised in any great depth and settle for simple moral solutions. It's an approach that resembles the original Star Trek series and their encounters with alien societies, with a similar reset button at the end to start things afresh next episode.Each of those episodes is fairly flatly delivered in terms of ideas, animation and voice-acting (the English dub even more dry than the Japanese version), but there are one or two episodes that stand out. One more threatening world sees Kino have to face opponents in deadly battle tournaments before she can leave (a fairly conventional device nonetheless that brings to mind Pokemon and Dragonball Z), and surprisingly, an intriguing and violent background episode on Kino's origins. None of this really adds up to anything significant or really pushes the anime into any new areas, but Kino's Journey does have a definite mood and character of its own.",3,"Moody, but simplistic and repetitive",1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,2053,"['curious', 'little', 'anime', 'series', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'norm', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'complete', 'series', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'long', 'rather', 'usual', 'extended', 'storyline', 'Kino', 'Journey', 'made', 'distinct', 'standalone', 'episodes', 'seeing', 'traveller', 'Kino', 'speaking', 'motorrad', 'Hermes', 'arriving', 'new', 'country', 'alternate', 'world', 'where', 'laws', 'govern', 'society', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'own', 'one', 'another.One', 'thing', 'almost', 'countries', 'have', 'common', 'welcome', 'travellers', 'visiting', 'country', 'fairly', 'infrequent', 'occurrence', 'are', 'keen', 'explain', 'how', 'society', 'works', 'show', 'around', 'Not', 'case', 'occasionally', 'country', 'Kino', 'been', 'subjected', 'profound', 'changes', 'caused', 'experiments', 'consciousness', 'technology', 'not', 'just', 'outsiders', 'other', 'are', 'interesting', 'fables', 'world', 'where', 'person', 'can', 'read', 'others', 'minds', 'world', 'where', 'mechanical', 'dolls', 'look', 'act', 'exactly', 'humans', 'compressed', '20', 'minutes', 'fairly', 'static', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'explore', 'issues', 'raised', 'great', 'depth', 'settle', 'simple', 'moral', 'solutions', 'approach', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'encounters', 'alien', 'societies', 'similar', 'reset', 'button', 'end', 'start', 'things', 'afresh', 'next', 'episode.Each', 'episodes', 'fairly', 'flatly', 'delivered', 'terms', 'ideas', 'animation', 'voice-acting', 'English', 'dub', 'even', 'more', 'dry', 'Japanese', 'version', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'One', 'more', 'threatening', 'world', 'Kino', 'have', 'face', 'opponents', 'deadly', 'battle', 'tournaments', 'can', 'leave', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'device', 'nonetheless', 'mind', 'Pokemon', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'surprisingly', 'intriguing', 'violent', 'background', 'episode', 'Kino', 'origins', 'None', 'really', 'up', 'anything', 'significant', 'really', 'anime', 'new', 'areas', 'Kino', 'Journey', 'have', 'definite', 'mood', 'character', 'own']",N/A

They never stay in one place for more than a couple days. Kino meets lots of interesting people. She always seems to run into folks that need her help. She is a good soul, and she never turns away from a person in need. She saves travelers from a blizzard, dethrones an evil tyrant, and helps a young lady achieve her dreams. Those are just a few of the good deeds she has under her belt. This is a magical story with good characters, and great life lessons.I enjoyed Kino's journey. It's not for you if you're looking for an action series. It's very slow paced. I actually got too relaxed and fell asleep while watching it. That doesn't mean that it isn't interesting. It's just relaxing. The animation is pretty simple, but really well done. The soundtrack and the voice cast are also good. I especially like the opening theme song. It's also acceptable for most viewers no matter their age. There is a little violence, but it's pretty mild. I think that the episodic nature of this series is one of it's downfalls. There aren't any characters t get attached to. I would have liked a little insight into Kino's past, and a glimpse at her future as well.

It is not that I don't enjoy it, but rather that I just don't choose to watch it. With my sister becoming enthralled in anime, I have found myself watching some every now and then. This is the first one that I fully watched the entire series of though.Kino is a traveler. She has no real purpose or no real reason for traveling other then that she enjoys it. She travels with her talking motorcycle, who is known as Hermes. There really is not a plot to speak of. Each episode Kino is usually in a new country (which are towns or cities) and has a different adventure. There are dangers along the way, which is why Kino dual wields to pistols, but this is not an action anime. The story is what brings you in and makes you want to keep watching every episode until the saddening ending.Kino has a back-story, but because it is revealed in an episode I will not reveal any of the details. She is extremely deadly with her pistols, but tries to refrain from using them at all costs. Kino moves from country to country, only staying for three days in each so she does not have a chance to settle down anywhere. Often times when visiting a country, she will learn that the country is corrupted or tainted in some way. Being curious, she will often ask what happened and become absorbed by the culture of the place she is in.The countries are all very unique. The first episode features a country completely run by machines. It has to be this way because the people created an invention that allowed them to read each other's minds. This caused too much pain and suffering and the people must stay locked away in their homes to avoid the disturbed thoughts and feelings of others. Do you think that would be interesting? If you do not, there is nothing to worry about. The next episode will be about Kino saving some traders in a completely different place.You will never find yourself bored with the plot, because it changes every episode. Each episode captures a lot of what is wrong or was wrong in our society. Extreme religious leaders, wasteful killing, and tyrants all are shown in this series. All thirteen episodes are packed with moralistic truths, which is unlike a lot of action heavy animes I have seen. Is this good for everyone? Doubtful. If you enjoy hearing a story told though, you are going to love this series.English and Japanese voice over is provided. There are also English subtitles, but they don't follow the dialogue accurately with the English voice over. They are more likely to be used for anyone watching the Japanese voice over. The English voice over is very well done though. Almost all the characters sound appropriate. Music is also well placed in this series. Nothing seems off at all, and it is usually very quiet.The idea of having thirteen completely unique episodes amazed me. Each episode carries a different, yet epic, storyline. Sometimes these stories are saddening, or perhaps revealing. No matter what, you can't go wrong with picking up Kino's Journey.

I feel that everyone that watches this and get something different out of it. Each episode(minus one or two) is it's own story but has the same underline story. Kino a young female(which I spent forever trying to find if she's male or female; very androgynous) is a traveler. She is given Hermes her talking motorcycle and travels form one society to another. Each one of these societies kind of seems as if it's a new world. There is not so much magic and monsters and demons, there is not really a good nor a bad. It's just the tale of several types of civilizations(I wonder if I spelt that right it looks weird).  She only always herself to stay for three days in each civilization. Just enough time to map it out, see their culture, accustoms, then do her partings.The very first episode left me with a very uneasy feeling for this anime. (which I think was the first almost positive). She is looking for a city, rarely spoke, riding a talking motorcycle, and the land she was on was physically randomly altering. She found a bride which was not previously there made out of land...not building material. Still not speaking stumbles upon this villiage, spoke to a few people(not saying much), for a night in front of a moonlit window pulling her gun in and out of her holster practicing her draw, and then proceeded with leaving. I was put off...greatly. But the dubbing was beyond amazing I felt to give it another chance. More dialogue came with the episodes.To me it seems as what if's such as. What if we tried to better our country doing this. But they where all series of small towns. Not all of them where submissive or passive style cultures either they range from towns who want to be known for being awkward and doing something different every time a traveler comes such as wearing cat ears, to a town which every visitor that enters may not leave. They are stuck fighting in a coliseum for their towns pleasure.  And it's a fight to the death unless you both stand down and the fight is a forfeit. That was as far as the action went in the series and kino really showed off her gun slinging abilities.I left the series rather glad I watched it. There was not really action, sex appeal, magic and such. It was just a story that I am very glad I got the chance to see. I'll admit I didn't buy it. I most likely won't until it's cheaper but I defiantly will. I only saw it on television each episode threw and I kind of with there was more.

And that's pretty much it.If I had to pick one word to chose to describe Kino's Journey it would be somber. Rarely are there really happy moments though there are quiet a few of sad moments but threw out the series retains a somber mood of a detached onlooker just like the characters.Another thing though serialized out side of two episodes none of the episodes have any conection other then Kino and Hermiese being in each one, which is rather rare for anime. One of the most unquic things about the series is Kino's attitude, she's not out to save the world, she's just wondering about learning about the countries she wonders threw, shes an observer and rarely medals with other people's affairs. There is no judgement just cause and effect leading to a rather believeable and reallalistic veiw of human nature.The animation is well done outside of the majority of side characters being plan and cut and paste to each story. The music is intransing. the voice acting is also well done. The Philosophy which is the main focus of the series is interesting. The really nothing bad about the series except the lack of time spent on most of the side characters and the lack of any meaning or grander purpase.

930590,A2PY5U9IUILU9W,B000AP31I8,"T. LaPonte ""mo""","[1, 2]","I have been able to identify with the heroine of this anime series more easily than any other that I have encountered thus far.  Kino above her desire to not be defined by her gender or age, is strong-willed, independent and follows the path that she has chosen for herself without ever wavering and always with open eyes and a healthy appreciation for the world around her.  Okay, perhaps ""identify"" is not the right word choice, as I don't feel I personally embody those ideals, but I certainly do ""admire"" every single one of them.Kino is, above all, an embodiment of a ""strong female"" character, without the baggage of ""femininity"" which all too often in anime renders that strength ultimately meaningless when the character ""falls in love"" or succumbs to the stereotypical ""weaknesses of womanhood"" when they sacrifice themselves for the sake of a child or some other such ridiculous stereotype.  I'm not saying that self-sacrifice is not something women are ""prone"" to, or that it is a bad thing, but I take issue with the assumption that women are, or more importantly should be, like that.  Kino as a character turns that concept on its head.She travels through the world on her sentient motorcycle, Hermes, visiting different lands, experiencing their cultures, and instead of being swayed to ""help"" them, or give something of herself to them, she moves on in order to experience the next.  Some have called her, and the series because of it, apathetic.  I would disagree, and Kino lays her reasoning out very early in the story.  Kino travels through the world with the eyes of an anthropologist: taking in everything with a wit that belies the youthfulness of her countenance, and above all protecting her own needs first, and the needs of anyone else afterwards.  She does not risk her own safety in order to affect host cultures, even if she believes that somehow she could ""help"" the situation.  Instead, when threatened or when pulled into a situation she cannot easily watch from the sidelines, Kino will react for her own sake.  If there's time after that, she'll consider others as well.  The threat of imposing ones own values upon a host culture is always at the forefront of Kino's mind, as the effect of culture works both ways.  Kino only wishes to avoid that and simply enjoy the world around her for what it is.  She is neither hero nor villain, having no interest in holding power over anyone nor any ambition other than to travel.When I saw the second episode in particular, concerning the value of human life against the lives of other living creatures and the personal choice to make one's own needs more important than the needs of others, it struck a serious chord.  The episode is shocking in many ways (not the least of which is the way it ends), but mostly what I took from it, and from the series as a whole, is that we do what we have to do to survive, and there are many horrible things in the world that force us to make those choices, but despite all of that the world is still a beautiful place full of wonderful things that we would be cheating ourselves out of if we refused to experience them (whether out of fear, ignorance or what-have-you).And the series does all of this without being pretentious or preaching morality.  That is not to say that Kino is a pushover by any means, or that the story is somehow boring and lacking in action.  To her credit, and despite her small stature, Kino is a crack shot, possibly one of the greatest marksmen in all of anime.  She's a quick study and is not above, or afraid, of using force to protect herself.  She likes to avoid taking life when possible, but she's not above that, either.  This lends the story to both quiet slow moments of appreciating the beauty around her and fast-paced action ones where that beauty is shattered, both of which compliment each other, never seeming out of place, even when the viewer is being jarred out of one by the other.I highly recommend Kino's Journey, especially to those who are looking for a good story that avoids many of the current trends (ie, moe) in anime.  The series runs a short 13 episodes (released in the no-thrills thinpack version here), is based on a series of novels by Keiichi Shigusawa (only thefirstof which was ever released in English) and features a wonderful soundtrack, including the beautiful opening theme ""All the Way"" byMikuni Shimokawa.",5,Simply Wonderful,1226188800,"11 9, 2008",2008,4395,"['have', 'been', 'able', 'identify', 'heroine', 'anime', 'series', 'more', 'easily', 'other', 'have', 'encountered', 'thus', 'far', 'Kino', 'desire', 'not', 'be', 'defined', 'gender', 'age', 'strong-willed', 'independent', 'path', 'chosen', 'herself', 'ever', 'wavering', 'always', 'open', 'eyes', 'healthy', 'appreciation', 'world', 'Okay', 'perhaps', 'identify', 'not', 'right', 'word', 'choice', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'personally', 'embody', 'ideals', 'certainly', 'do', 'admire', 'single', 'one', 'them.Kino', 'embodiment', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'baggage', 'femininity', 'too', 'often', 'anime', 'renders', 'strength', 'ultimately', 'meaningless', 'when', 'character', 'love', 'succumbs', 'stereotypical', 'weaknesses', 'womanhood', 'when', 'sacrifice', 'sake', 'child', 'other', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'stereotype', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'self-sacrifice', 'not', 'something', 'women', 'are', 'prone', 'bad', 'thing', 'take', 'issue', 'assumption', 'women', 'are', 'more', 'importantly', 'should', 'be', 'Kino', 'character', 'concept', 'head.She', 'travels', 'world', 'sentient', 'motorcycle', 'Hermes', 'visiting', 'different', 'lands', 'experiencing', 'cultures', 'instead', 'being', 'swayed', 'help', 'give', 'something', 'herself', 'order', 'experience', 'next', 'have', 'called', 'series', 'apathetic', 'would', 'disagree', 'Kino', 'reasoning', 'out', 'very', 'early', 'story', 'Kino', 'world', 'eyes', 'anthropologist', 'taking', 'everything', 'wit', 'youthfulness', 'countenance', 'protecting', 'own', 'needs', 'first', 'needs', 'anyone', 'else', 'afterwards', 'not', 'risk', 'own', 'safety', 'order', 'affect', 'host', 'cultures', 'even', 'somehow', 'could', 'help', 'situation', 'Instead', 'when', 'threatened', 'when', 'pulled', 'situation', 'can', 'not', 'easily', 'watch', 'sidelines', 'Kino', 'will', 'react', 'own', 'sake', 'time', ""'ll"", 'consider', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'threat', 'imposing', 'ones', 'own', 'values', 'host', 'culture', 'always', 'forefront', 'Kino', 'mind', 'effect', 'culture', 'ways', 'Kino', 'only', 'avoid', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'world', 'what', 'hero', 'villain', 'having', 'interest', 'holding', 'power', 'anyone', 'ambition', 'other', 'travel.When', 'saw', 'second', 'episode', 'particular', 'concerning', 'value', 'human', 'life', 'lives', 'other', 'living', 'creatures', 'personal', 'choice', 'make', 'one', 'own', 'more', 'important', 'needs', 'others', 'struck', 'serious', 'chord', 'episode', 'shocking', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'least', 'way', 'mostly', 'what', 'took', 'series', 'whole', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'survive', 'are', 'many', 'horrible', 'things', 'world', 'force', 'make', 'choices', 'world', 'still', 'beautiful', 'place', 'full', 'wonderful', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'cheating', 'refused', 'experience', 'fear', 'ignorance', 'what-have-you', 'series', 'being', 'pretentious', 'preaching', 'morality', 'not', 'say', 'Kino', 'pushover', 'means', 'story', 'somehow', 'boring', 'lacking', 'action', 'credit', 'small', 'stature', 'Kino', 'crack', 'shot', 'possibly', 'one', 'greatest', 'marksmen', 'anime', 'quick', 'study', 'not', 'above', 'afraid', 'using', 'force', 'protect', 'avoid', 'taking', 'life', 'when', 'possible', 'not', 'either', 'story', 'quiet', 'slow', 'moments', 'appreciating', 'beauty', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'ones', 'where', 'beauty', 'shattered', 'compliment', 'other', 'never', 'seeming', 'place', 'even', 'when', 'viewer', 'being', 'jarred', 'one', 'other.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Kino', 'Journey', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'story', 'many', 'current', 'trends', 'ie', 'moe', 'anime', 'series', 'short', '13', 'episodes', 'released', 'no-thrills', 'thinpack', 'version', 'here', 'based', 'series', 'novels', 'Keiichi', 'Shigusawa', 'only', 'thefirstof', 'was', 'ever', 'released', 'English', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'beautiful', 'opening', 'theme', 'Way', 'byMikuni', 'Shimokawa']",N/A

Some good and some bad episodes, mostly meh, but Kino's Journey still manages to be a worthwhile watch.",3,detached lands (3.3),1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,502,"['one', 'land', 'everything', 'done', 'robots', '13th', 'century', 'denmark', 'something', 'motorcycle', 'ride', 'self', 'different', 'time', 'period', 'episode', 'annoying', 'places', 'feel', 'completely', 'separate', 'Also', 'lot', 'episodes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'moral', 'story', 'so', 'bearing', 'over', 'stated', 'got', 'nerves', 'good', 'bad', 'episodes', 'mostly', 'meh', 'Kino', 'Journey', 'still', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'watch']",N/A

Kino's Journey is an well-needed break from the everyday anime that most people are used to. The anime is almost Twilight-Zone-ish in that Kino, an androgynous traveler, travels across a world similar to Earth, but with countries and people very much different from ourselves. Kino and Hermes, Kino's motorrad, find themselves in ever interesting situations in their travels, raising questions about humanity and what it really is.The artwork is simplistic, the music is minimalist, but what really keeps you watching is how well the stories keep you captivated, and of course, how the reveal is always saved for the end if the episode. Kino's Journey is not about random killing, lusty females, or a simple plotline. The anime usually leaves you with something to think about, thanks to wonderful characters, especially Kino and Hermes, who provide separate and yet valid viewpoints, sometimes contrdictory of each other, but always provocative.Kino's Journey is an adventure of the mind, and although it is not necessarily visually-stunning or flashy, it provides an entertaining philosophical experience that depicts instead of the cheap and overused rhetorical question by the main character into the night sky. Kino does, and lets the viewer decide.",5,A Surreal Series,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,1403,"['Anime', 'Kino', 'Journey', 'rarity', 'nowadays', 'when', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'wanton', 'violence', 'excessive', 'fan', 'service', 'formulaic', 'presentation', 'Kino', 'Journey', 'well-needed', 'break', 'everyday', 'anime', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'used', 'anime', 'almost', 'Twilight-Zone-ish', 'Kino', 'androgynous', 'traveler', 'travels', 'world', 'similar', 'Earth', 'countries', 'people', 'very', 'much', 'different', 'Kino', 'Hermes', 'Kino', 'motorrad', 'find', 'ever', 'interesting', 'situations', 'travels', 'raising', 'questions', 'humanity', 'what', 'really', 'is.The', 'artwork', 'simplistic', 'music', 'minimalist', 'what', 'really', 'watching', 'how', 'well', 'stories', 'keep', 'captivated', 'course', 'how', 'reveal', 'always', 'saved', 'end', 'episode', 'Kino', 'Journey', 'not', 'random', 'killing', 'lusty', 'females', 'simple', 'plotline', 'anime', 'usually', 'something', 'think', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'especially', 'Kino', 'Hermes', 'who', 'provide', 'separate', 'yet', 'valid', 'viewpoints', 'sometimes', 'contrdictory', 'other', 'always', 'provocative.Kino', 'Journey', 'adventure', 'mind', 'not', 'necessarily', 'visually-stunning', 'flashy', 'entertaining', 'philosophical', 'experience', 'instead', 'cheap', 'overused', 'rhetorical', 'question', 'main', 'character', 'night', 'sky', 'Kino', 'viewer', 'decide']",N/A
