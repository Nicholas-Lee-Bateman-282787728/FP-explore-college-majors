Sure, many of the gags were simple slapstick stuff but it worked. This was truly a funny movie and Lucille Ball and Eddie Albert made a great pair.This film also was a good preview of what audiences were going to see down the road when Ball became super-famous on television. She plays a similar type of character: a well-meaning ditz who gets into one jam after another. Here, she winds up an innocent victim and has gangsters chasing her and Albert all over town.I only wish this was out on DVD or even on a good (and cheaper) VHS tape in the United States. Many people have never heard of this film.

I agree with other reviewers, put this on DVD! The movie is a bit slow at first, but gets better and better as it progresses. My favorite part is when they are on the ship with the diamonds, except for the banana spiders... You will not be disappointed with this one if you love Lucy.

""The Fuller Brush Girl"" was filmed in 1950 as a  sequel to the very popular ""The Fuller Brush Man"", which starred Lucille's  male counterpart, Red Skelton.It's the story of a young couple, Kathleen  and Humphrey, who just want to get married, buy a house and live happily  ever after. But about the time they think they can put a down payment on  their dream house, Kathleen causes a hugh electrical fire at the shipping  company where she and Humphrey work and loses her job. Undaunted she  decides to try door-to-door sales as a Fuller Brush Girl (she actually  sells cosemtics, not brushes). Meanwhile back at the shipping company  Humphrey is promoted to shipping manager, only he dosen't realize that he  is being set-up as the fall guy by a smuggling ring. Through a hilarious  set of circumstances the bumbling Fuller Brush Girl and the smuggling ring  get mixed-up with each other and all hell breaks loose. In the ensuing  tangle, there is murder, mayheim, police chases, a very funny striptease  and some of the funniest sight-gags ever put on film.The cast includes a  very young Eddie Albert as Humphrey, Jeff Donnell as Kathleen's best friend  and a who's Who cast of character actors.The production values on this  film are ""B"" quality at best but they actually help make this film really  easy to watch. As a trivia note, the musical number in the film ""Put The  Blame On Mame"" was the same recording used to dub Rita Hayworth's voice in  the film ""Gilda"".",4,Lucille Ball Shines in a Hilarious Farce,950054400,"02 9, 2000",2000,1644,"['was', 'one', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'last', 'theatrical', 'films', 'prior', 'debut', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'looks', 'things', 'was', 'final', 'primer', 'role', 'Lucy', 'Ricardo', 'Fuller', 'Brush', 'Girl', 'was', 'filmed', '1950', 'sequel', 'very', 'popular', 'Fuller', 'Brush', 'Man', 'starred', 'Lucille', 'male', 'counterpart', 'Red', 'Skelton.It', 'story', 'young', 'couple', 'Kathleen', 'Humphrey', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'buy', 'house', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'time', 'think', 'can', 'put', 'down', 'payment', 'dream', 'house', 'Kathleen', 'hugh', 'electrical', 'fire', 'shipping', 'company', 'where', 'Humphrey', 'work', 'job', 'Undaunted', 'try', 'door-to-door', 'sales', 'Fuller', 'Brush', 'Girl', 'actually', 'cosemtics', 'not', 'brushes', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'shipping', 'company', 'Humphrey', 'promoted', 'shipping', 'manager', 'only', 'dose', ""n't"", 'realize', 'being', 'set-up', 'fall', 'guy', 'smuggling', 'ring', 'hilarious', 'set', 'circumstances', 'bumbling', 'Fuller', 'Brush', 'Girl', 'smuggling', 'ring', 'get', 'mixed-up', 'other', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'ensuing', 'tangle', 'murder', 'mayheim', 'police', 'chases', 'very', 'funny', 'striptease', 'funniest', 'sight-gags', 'ever', 'put', 'film.The', 'cast', 'very', 'young', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Humphrey', 'Jeff', 'Donnell', 'Kathleen', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'Who', 'cast', 'character', 'actors.The', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'B', 'quality', 'best', 'actually', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'really', 'easy', 'watch', 'trivia', 'note', 'musical', 'number', 'film', 'Put', 'Blame', 'Mame', 'was', 'same', 'recording', 'used', 'dub', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'voice', 'film', 'Gilda']",N/A

Taking along her boyfriend Humphrey (Eddie Albert), Sally has to escape the police and gets herself into some hilarious situations...Seemingly but only coincidentally, This little Columbia flick from 1950 seems like a primer for Ball's Lucy Ricardo character as it showcases Lucy in lots of slapstick, chases and other great comic bits which were to become her specialty.
