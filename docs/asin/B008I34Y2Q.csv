1553649,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B008I34Y2Q,D. Hartley,"[3, 6]","On a trip to Myanmar a while back, Secretary of State Clinton publicly expressed her admiration for Burmese political activist Aung San Suu Kyi, acknowledging her long personal struggle (including 15 years of house arrest) as head of an opposition party that has been (peacefully) attempting to bring democracy to a country that has been under oppressive military rule for 50 years. Indeed, Suu Kyi's story is an extraordinary one (and which one hopes is far from over). That's why it's a shame that Luc Besson's biopic, ""The Lady"", while timely in its release, can only be described as ""ordinary"" in its execution. It's an oddly uninvolving affair that starts off like ""Gandhi""...but ends up more like ""Camille"".The film begins with a beautifully constructed and emotionally affecting preface depicting the 3-year old Suu Kyi kissing her father goodbye for what turns out to be the last time. The year is 1947, the place is Burma (as it was then known) and General Aung San (who today is considered the  nation's ""Father"" for his key role in helping it gain independence from British colonial rule) is off to a political meeting, where he is assassinated. The next time we see Suu Kyi (Michelle Yeoh), she is an adult, living in England with her husband, Oxford academic Dr. Michael Aris (David Thewlis). They have two teenage sons. When Suu Kyi learns that her mother is gravely ill, she returns to Burma to be at her side. It is during this visit (in 1988) that she realizes how socio-politically unstable her country has become, and how fear and dread rule the lives of her people. When she is asked by pro-democracy activists to remain in-country to lead their burgeoning movement, she accepts.After this promising setup, I assumed that I was in for a rousing story of personal sacrifice and determination, set against a backdrop of intense political turmoil and sweeping historical breadth (something along the lines of ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" or ""The Killing Fields""). I assumed. But what follows instead is pure boilerplate; holding all the dramatic import of a Powerpoint presentation. Rebecca Frayn's screenplay takes a Cliff's Notes approach to Suu Kyi's life; for a 2  hour film, there are an inordinate amount of unanswered questions and expository holes. Perhaps most significantly, the film is marketed as being a great love story...but there is very little passion on display in the scenes between Thewlis and Yeoh; there is nothing offered onscreen that gives us any clue as to what sparked the attraction between the two. While I'll grant that it is possible Thewlis made an acting choice to play the ""stiff upper lip"" Englishman archetype, his behavior toward Yeoh plays out as formal and detached.Instead, we're given a seemingly endless series of farewells and reunions, with Thewlis and sons leaving and arriving in taxis over the years, with only Eric Serra's overbearing orchestral swells on hand to cue us that we're supposed to be tearing up. And the part of the family's story that should truly move us, which was Dr. Aris' death from prostate cancer after spending the final 4 years of his life unsuccessfully petitioning the Burmese government for permission to visit Suu Kyi (under house arrest), is instead rendered like sudsy, almost laughable (if it weren't so inherently sad) Disease of the Week melodrama.As I am a fan of his work, I was expecting much more from Besson, who has built his reputation on slickly produced, well-paced and visually inventive films that frequently feature strong female protagonists (""La Femme Nikita"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc""). What he has delivered here (the opening 10 minutes aside) is a film that, while visually stunning, remains emotionally empty. For a more compelling portrait of modern-day Burma, I would recommend the documentary ""They Call it Myanmar: Lifting the Curtain"". In that film, you see and hear the real Suu Kyi, and although her appearance is brief, it reveals a whole lot more about the determination, grace and fortitude of this remarkable woman.",2,Besson attempts to go Costa-Gavras,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,4083,"['trip', 'Myanmar', 'while', 'back', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Clinton', 'publicly', 'expressed', 'admiration', 'Burmese', 'political', 'activist', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'acknowledging', 'long', 'personal', 'struggle', 'including', '15', 'years', 'house', 'arrest', 'head', 'opposition', 'party', 'been', 'peacefully', 'attempting', 'bring', 'democracy', 'country', 'been', 'oppressive', 'military', 'rule', '50', 'years', 'Indeed', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'story', 'extraordinary', 'one', 'one', 'far', 'why', 'shame', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'biopic', 'Lady', 'timely', 'release', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'ordinary', 'execution', 'oddly', 'uninvolving', 'affair', 'Gandhi', 'up', 'more', 'Camille', '.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'preface', 'depicting', '3-year', 'old', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'kissing', 'father', 'goodbye', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'year', '1947', 'place', 'Burma', 'was', 'then', 'known', 'General', 'Aung', 'San', 'who', 'today', 'considered', 'nation', 'Father', 'key', 'role', 'helping', 'gain', 'independence', 'British', 'colonial', 'rule', 'political', 'meeting', 'where', 'assassinated', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'adult', 'living', 'England', 'husband', 'Oxford', 'Dr.', 'Michael', 'Aris', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'have', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'When', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'mother', 'gravely', 'ill', 'Burma', 'be', 'side', 'visit', '1988', 'how', 'socio-politically', 'unstable', 'country', 'become', 'how', 'fear', 'dread', 'rule', 'lives', 'people', 'When', 'asked', 'pro-democracy', 'activists', 'remain', 'in-country', 'lead', 'burgeoning', 'movement', 'accepts.After', 'promising', 'setup', 'assumed', 'was', 'rousing', 'story', 'personal', 'sacrifice', 'determination', 'set', 'backdrop', 'intense', 'political', 'turmoil', 'sweeping', 'historical', 'breadth', 'something', 'lines', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'assumed', 'what', 'instead', 'pure', 'boilerplate', 'holding', 'dramatic', 'import', 'Powerpoint', 'presentation', 'Rebecca', 'Frayn', 'screenplay', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'approach', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'life', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'are', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'expository', 'holes', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'significantly', 'film', 'marketed', 'being', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'little', 'passion', 'display', 'scenes', 'Thewlis', 'Yeoh', 'nothing', 'offered', 'onscreen', 'clue', 'what', 'sparked', 'attraction', 'two', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'possible', 'Thewlis', 'made', 'acting', 'choice', 'play', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'Englishman', 'archetype', 'behavior', 'Yeoh', 'out', 'formal', 'detached.Instead', ""'re"", 'given', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'series', 'farewells', 'reunions', 'Thewlis', 'sons', 'leaving', 'arriving', 'taxis', 'years', 'only', 'Eric', 'Serra', 'overbearing', 'orchestral', 'swells', 'hand', 'cue', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'tearing', 'up', 'part', 'family', 'story', 'should', 'truly', 'move', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Aris', 'death', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'spending', 'final', '4', 'years', 'life', 'unsuccessfully', 'petitioning', 'Burmese', 'government', 'permission', 'visit', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'house', 'arrest', 'instead', 'rendered', 'sudsy', 'almost', 'laughable', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'inherently', 'sad', 'Disease', 'Week', 'melodrama.As', 'am', 'fan', 'work', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'more', 'Besson', 'who', 'built', 'reputation', 'slickly', 'produced', 'well-paced', 'visually', 'inventive', 'films', 'frequently', 'feature', 'strong', 'female', 'protagonists', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Messenger', 'Story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'What', 'delivered', 'here', 'opening', '10', 'minutes', 'aside', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'emotionally', 'empty', 'more', 'compelling', 'portrait', 'modern-day', 'Burma', 'would', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'Call', 'Myanmar', 'Lifting', 'Curtain', 'film', 'see', 'hear', 'real', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'appearance', 'brief', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'determination', 'grace', 'fortitude', 'remarkable', 'woman']",N/A
1553650,A328S9RN3U5M68,B008I34Y2Q,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Despite the flaws in this dramatized biopic of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi  - far too long at 132 minutes, more emphasis on a family drama than an important change in Burma to Myanmar, etc - this film as written by Rebecca Frayn and directed by Luc Beeson (Taken, Transporter, La Femme Nikita, etc) deserves our attention in that it helps explain the volatile situation that existed in Burma from 1947 to the present. In brief it is the story of Aung San Suu Kyi as she becomes the core of Burma's democracy movement, and her relationship with her husband, Oxford professor and writer Michael Aris.Opening in 1947 we meet Aung San Suu Kyi as a child bidding farewell to her father, General Aung San, a hero of the Burmese democratic movement, who is then assassinated. Aung San Suu Kyi (Michelle Leoh) escapes to England, matures, marries an Oxford professor Michael (David Thewlis) and has two sons (Jonathan Raggett and Jonathan Woodhouse). The film then jumps to 1988 when, due to the fact that her mother is critically ill, Suu Kyi  returns to Burma to care for her mother; once there she observes the student protests to the military regime headed by a dummy superstitious dictator, and as the heir to her father's fame in the country as a leader of the people she decides to stay and follow the encouragement of the protestors to be their leader. That decision places here in danger and eventual house arrest, and with the love of her husband and children as support she stays the course and becomes the leader of the democratic movement of the country now called Myanmar. The commitment to her cause by her husband (who discovers in Suu Kyi's absence that he has prostate cancer and a limited life span) offers her strength and she gains world attention when she is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.THE LADY is more an epic love story about how an extraordinary couple and family sacrifice their happiness at great human cost for a higher cause than it is a full study of the persona of Aung San Suu Kyi Much is missing, especially the period in Burma from 1947 to 1988, and the maturing of Suu Kyi into a hero. But the film does emphasize the peaceful quest of the woman who is at the core of Burma's democracy movement and the indomitable love relationship and strength of marriage and family due to their undying support of her mission. Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis are excellent and the film has touches of beauty that are memorable (as Suu Kyi listens on a portable radio to the Nobel Prize speech read by her son the music that is so much a part of Suu Kyi's life is her playing of the Pachelbel Canon accompanied by a small orchestra over a distance of thousands of miles). It is a touching tribute to a great lady of peace.

I'm still trying to get my head around the fact that this tiny woman, all of about 90 pounds, is at the same time so huge.Michelle Yeoh is outstanding (as are the other leads).As for releases:My first copy of this was from Canada (featuring French menu, and with a French voice track and subtitles, in addition to the English), but via Hong Kong.  The English subtitles (which remain on screen even when the actors are speaking English) are atrocious.  For that reason, though hesitant because of the price, I bought blu-ray copy of the ""Cohen"" release.  The English subtitles are reworked, so are fine.  And they aren't on screen when the dialog is in English.So if you enjoy the film, prefer accurate subtitles, and the price isn't too much of an obstacle, go for the ""Cohen"" release._____For those who've seen it, and if they had questions about her conversation with her son Kim while her husband is dying -- her saying, ""try to understand,"" and, ""my hands are tied"" -- this, from her speech, ""Freedom from Fear,"" illuminates, in which she is speaking of ""a-gati"" of Buddhist ethics:""It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.  Most Burmese are familiar with the four a-gati, the four kinds of corruption.  Chanda-gati, corruption induced by desire, is deviation from the right path in pursuit of bribes or for the sake of those one loves.  Dosa-gati is taking the wrong path to spite those against whom one bears ill will, and moga-gati is aberration due to ignorance.  But perhaps the worst of the four is bhaya-gati, for not only does bhaya, fear, stifle and slowly destroy all sense of right and wrong, it so often lies at the root of the other three kinds of corruption.  Just as chanda-gati, when not the result of sheer avarice, can be caused by fear of want or fear of losing the goodwill of those one loves, so fear of being surpassed, humiliated or injured in some way can provide the impetus for ill will.  And it would be difficult to dispel ignorance unless there is freedom to pursue the truth unfettered by fear.  With so close a relationship between fear and corruption it is little wonder that in any society where fear is rife corruption in all forms becomes deeply entrenched.""Specifically:""Chanda-gati, corruption induced by desire, is deviation from the right path in pursuit of bribes or for the sake of those one loves.""And: "". . . . chanda-gati, when not the result of sheer avarice, can be caused by fear of want or fear of losing the goodwill of those one loves . . . .""I read somewhere a cryptic comment about her son/s being angry, apparently at her for not being there when their father died.

1553653,A1VOPP2OFITP7D,B008I34Y2Q,June Bug,"[0, 0]","What a truly admirable person!  San Suu Kyi definitely deserves to be compared to the courageous peace advocates such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mandela.  At great personal sacrifice, she returned to Burma knowing that she was facing hostile, military opposition.  Her many years under house arrest without the ability to even speak to her husband and children in the face of possible murder shows her true faith in her convictions.  Few today, even give thought to doing something on behalf of their fellow citizens without at least a day in the media and an award in it for them.Those who criticize this as a romance really miss the mark and the essence of the movie.  A mother's sacrifice for her country over her most prized things (a loving husband and two great sons) is great.  Ask any woman, who has lost a child!  In fact, though her husband died of cancer, she chose to stay because leaving to be at his side would have prevented her from returning to Myanmar.  Mike (Suu's husband) was an academic advocating for freedom on Asian countrymen, which is how they met.  He, too suffered great loneliness and separation from her house arrest being refused a VISA to visit her.  He didn't tell her of the cancer because he wanted her to stay.  This did not diminish the story.  If you want to see a great movie, it doesn't require John Wayne.  There was quite a bit of murder, guns, and blood on the screen to satisfy the testosterone requirements of most men.My only complaint about this very convincing movie and it is minor, was that the actor, playing the eldest son did not look Asian and Caucasian but rather African and Caucasian.  He had very kinky hair; his skin tone and nose looked more African and likewise he wore a heavy beard, perhaps they were trying to give him a likeness to the father character, but the complexion was to different.  Meanwhile, the younger son definitely had features more appropriate to his heritage.Additionally, the cinematography was excellent. This terrific movie was well acted.  I was not familiar with any of the actors, with the exception of David Thewlis prior to watching but all were convincing.

David Thewlis is quite talented as well.

1553654,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008I34Y2Q,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 12]","The story of Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi has surely got to be one of the most compelling, fascinating, and inspirational tales of fortitude and commitment in the arena of international politics.  Winning the Nobel Peace Prize for her struggles to bring democracy to her war-torn land, Suu Kyi gave up everything (including family and freedom) for a cause and a country.  It is an epic ongoing tale, one that would surely make an incredible film.  Luc Besson, perhaps best known for his flair for stylistic action, takes on ""The Lady"" and it is a real change-of-pace from his usual fare.  The wisest decision that Besson made was casting Michelle Yeoh in the leading role.  She brings a tremendous dignity to the proceedings and her calm AND gravitas make her quite believable as Burma's national heroine.  ""The Lady"" doesn't play as a straight-up biography, though.  The focus of the film is Suu Kyi's family.  I think this is an interesting idea to explore, but also one that I didn't think truly worked.  By splitting the plot lines, we end up gaining very little insight into Suu Kyi or the political climate of Burma.  If you aren't intimately familiar with the story, you might question why Suu Kyi is so passionate to the cause and just what her specific contributions are.The movie begins with a bit of back story.  We see Suu Kyi's father (a hero of the independence movement) murdered as Burma is presented as a land ruled by force.  We then fast forward to Suu Kyi playing the role of an average British housewife.  She has a perfect family, her husband (David Thewlis) is an Oxford professor and her two teenage boys are vaguely interchangeable.  When her mother back home in Burma becomes ill, she returns to her homeland.  Due to her heritage, she is held up as a prominent face for reform.  Soon she is being elevated to leader status, but the screenplay never really explains this process in any detail.  One day she's just ready to take the mantle.  I wanted to see more of what made this transition, get closer to the Suu Kyi character.  But we remain somewhat distant throughout due to the split focus.  While Suu Kyi is becoming a political power (mostly off screen), Thewlis struggles with cooking and laundry.  Really?  But ""The Lady"" is meant to be a more personal telling as the family is divided and threatened.  Once again, though, some insight into these personal travails would also have been appreciated.  Yeoh and Thewlis never waver from their convictions, display doubt, or wrestle with these hardships in any tangible way.  They just accept them nobly and, thus, the love story also lacks a certain depth.But it's hard to dismiss ""The Lady"" and, indeed, I quite recommend it.  I just don't think that it is the great film that it might have been.  Through it all, I couldn't take my eyes off of Yeoh and this is easily her strongest performance in years.  Despite the gaps in the story, she made me believe that Suu Kyi would stand as a country's role model.  I wish the story wasn't so muted in its political explanations, because really understanding Burma and its struggles would have made this a profound experience.  With this woman of sacrifice and solidity, though, the movie still packs an emotional punch.  More a love letter to a relationship than an in-depth biography, ""The Lady"" is a well made film for adults.  But for me, it misses the mark to make it the unforgettable epic that it deserved to be.  I'd love to see the subject matter explored again with a slightly different perspective. But, for now, ""The Lady"" and especially Yeoh have whetted my appetite to read up on the real life Suu Kyi.  And that's something.

This film's deserving subject rates its four star rating.Like much of the world, I am a long-time admirer of Aung San Suu Kyi.  I became familiar with this incredibly inspirational woman from just reading news articles about her in THE WASHINGTON POST.  This film admirably fleshes out these biographical details, into an extremely compelling story about her late-life activist endeavors on behalf of the ""Burmese"" people, a role she did not seek.Aung San Suu Kyi's petite physical attractiveness and captivating yet disarming personal presence, suitably complements her humanistic character.  The actress Michelle Yeoh is something of an Aung San Suu Kyi look-alike, and is well-cast to portray the attributes and accomplishments of Aung San Suu Kyi.Maybe I love Aung San Suu Kyi because she always wears flowers in her hair - always.  Remember the song lyric from the 1960s, ""Be sure to wear flowers in your hair!""I was fortunate to view this film shortly before Aung San Suu Kyi made her triumphal visit to Europe in the summer of 2012, in part to receive a long delayed bestowal of her Nobel Peace Prize, and to hear parts of her acceptance speech.Aung San Suu Kyi's triumphal tour of Europe also physically exhausted her - there was simply not enough of this petite and forcibly secluded woman to satisfy the overwhelming emotional embrace and demands of many people, and many countries, who all seemed to want her for themselves.  She even had the extremely rare honor of, I believe, a private citizen addressing the Parliament of the UK.To quote the Olympic Creed, because she has ""endured the struggle,"" Aung San Suu Kyi ""Has brought honor to us all.""Watch this DVD, and see why.I will purchase this DVD as soon as it is released for sale.I will also purchase a copy of this DVD for my 15-year old daughter, so she will know what a woman can do - particularly a woman in a repressive, patriarchal world.",4,"Aung San Suu Kyi ""Brings Honor to Us All""",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2122,"['film', 'great', 'merit', 'incredibly', 'inspirational', 'subject', 'biography', 'luminous', 'internationally', 'acclaimed', 'democracy', 'peoples', 'rights', 'activist', 'Noble', 'Peace', 'Prize', 'laureate', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'film', 'deserving', 'subject', 'rates', 'four', 'star', 'rating.Like', 'much', 'world', 'am', 'long-time', 'admirer', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'became', 'familiar', 'incredibly', 'inspirational', 'woman', 'just', 'reading', 'news', 'articles', 'THE', 'WASHINGTON', 'POST', 'film', 'admirably', 'out', 'biographical', 'details', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'story', 'late-life', 'activist', 'endeavors', 'behalf', 'Burmese', 'people', 'role', 'did', 'not', 'seek.Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'petite', 'physical', 'attractiveness', 'captivating', 'yet', 'disarming', 'personal', 'presence', 'suitably', 'humanistic', 'character', 'actress', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'something', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'look-alike', 'well-cast', 'portray', 'attributes', 'accomplishments', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi.Maybe', 'love', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'always', 'flowers', 'hair', 'always', 'Remember', 'song', 'lyric', '1960s', 'Be', 'sure', 'wear', 'flowers', 'hair', 'was', 'fortunate', 'view', 'film', 'shortly', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'made', 'triumphal', 'visit', 'Europe', 'summer', '2012', 'part', 'receive', 'long', 'delayed', 'bestowal', 'Nobel', 'Peace', 'Prize', 'hear', 'parts', 'acceptance', 'speech.Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'triumphal', 'tour', 'Europe', 'also', 'physically', 'exhausted', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'enough', 'petite', 'forcibly', 'secluded', 'woman', 'satisfy', 'overwhelming', 'emotional', 'embrace', 'demands', 'many', 'people', 'many', 'countries', 'who', 'seemed', 'want', 'even', 'had', 'extremely', 'rare', 'honor', 'believe', 'private', 'citizen', 'addressing', 'Parliament', 'UK.To', 'quote', 'Olympic', 'Creed', 'endured', 'struggle', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'Has', 'brought', 'honor', 'Watch', 'DVD', 'see', 'why.I', 'will', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'as', 'soon', 'released', 'sale.I', 'will', 'also', 'purchase', 'copy', 'DVD', '15-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'woman', 'can', 'do', 'particularly', 'woman', 'repressive', 'patriarchal', 'world']",N/A
1553657,A238W7T3KJAKQH,B008I34Y2Q,shaun brammer,"[0, 0]","I have long admired Aung San Suu Kyi. She is a woman of unbending will, who firmly believes in the good of people and the power of compassion over violence. She has endured a long battle for the freedom of the Burmese that is still not concluded. This battle has cost her so much of her life. She wasn&#8217;t there for her sons, husband, or close friends. She gave all of herself to continue the work her father began. The national  hero Aung San freed his people from the imperial rule of both Britain and Japan. He tried to bring democracy to Burma and was assassinated for his efforts when Suu was but a child. So, when I heard that Luc Besson planned on making a film about the great lady Suu Kyi, I was afraid that it would cheapen her imagine and take away from her work. When I found out that Michelle Yeoh was going to play Aung San Suu Kyi, I thought this was a good thing, but still had reservations. I finally sat down to watch The Lady, and besides a few minor things, I found the film wonderfully done and a great tool to introduce those unfamiliar with the struggle of Aung San Suu Kyi and her people.The film is told through the viewpoints of both Aung San Suu Kyi, as portrayed by Michelle Yeoh, and her husband Michael Aris, played by David Thewlis, or as many know him, Remus Lupin. Since the two spent so much time apart, yet struggled for the same cause, these two viewpoints make perfect sense. However, that did not stop some ignorant individuals from voicing their suspicions concerning the film being &#8216;white washed&#8217;. My only response is that Michael Aris was important enough to Aung San Suu Kyi that she married him, so including him in her story seems more like honoring her than trying to get white people undeserved credit. So, what the viewer sees is Suu Kyi under house arrest and struggling to find ways to protect her people while trying to talk to the government. On the English side of things, you see Michael Aris and his brother Anthony Aris, also played by David Thewlis, trying to find ways to support her and bring international attention to her fight.I won&#8217;t go into a detailed synopsis of the plot, as that is more of the historical narrative, which the film follows faithfully. Instead, I will speak on the performances delivered, which were amazing. David Thewlis plays both brothers Aris and makes it difficult to tell that he is the same actor when both are on the screen. He painfully captures Michael&#8217;s slow collapse from cancer, slowly becoming more sick and more tired, as if the struggle to save Burma and his wife ends up physically destroying him. Such might have been the case. Michelle Yeoh truly becomes Aung San Suu Kyi and not just in appearance. I have watched many hours of Aung San Suu Kyi speaking and found it more than just uncanny how well Michelle Yeoh portrayed her. The slight way she walks, or raises her hand. The rhythm of her voice and stern but compassionate facial expressions, all of them Yeoh was able to reproduce. Yeoh also learned Burmese to be able to deliver Suu Kyi&#8217;s famous speeches in her native language. I was most moved during the scene that shows Suu Kyi facing off with a wall of rifle toting soldiers threatening to shoot her and her followers. She faces them down with the calm resolution of the Buddha facing down the rampaging elephant. Her break down when learning of Michael&#8217;s death was heart wrenching. Yes, Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis carried this film.The set should be commended as well. The production team recreated Suu Kyi&#8217;s childhood home, the one she was placed in house arrest in perfectly. Much of the filming was done in Thailand, as they were not allowed to film in Burma at all. Though that didn&#8217;t stop them. Luc Besson and his team of camera persons went to Burma and filmed several locations, guerilla style, some were even arrested. These scenes are weaved into the film seamlessly. They also did their best to make use of the large population of Burmese refugees living in Thailand, many of whom are Suu Kyi supporters. They helped bring to life an accurate recounting of pivotal moments in Suu Kyi&#8217;s struggle, like her speeches and visiting villages outside of Rangoon.My only complaint was the music, but not even all the music. I found some of the score, provided by Eric Serra, to be a bit too The King and I. What I mean by this is that he tried to incorporate generic Asian melodies into what he wrote. Instead of utilizing traditional Burmese melodies he turned to what sounded like over used Chinese melodies, the kind Hollywood always turns to when they make an Asian themed film. For other parts of the film he did just fine, but those few instances really spoiled the moment. There were other times when classical pieces were used, and used very well. For the most part the music was fine, but the end of the film was ruined by the musical choices of Luc Besson.There were two songs near the end that really affected the impact of the film. One was a tune that sounded like U2, or a wannabe cover band, that made the ending feel like a motivational commercial rather then a major period of Burma&#8217;s history that began the changes in the country&#8217;s fate. This cheap tune was played during the proytral of the army of monks who marched to Suu Kyi&#8217;s house and demanded the government end her house arrest. The other was the song that played during the credits. It was Sade&#8217;s Solider of Love. Now, I am not going to say anything bad about the song. I am a big fan of Sade, though more her early work, and the song is still fun and an ok tune to listen to. However, it doesn&#8217;t fit the character of Aung San Suu Kyi or the character of film. Luc Besson, whether he is aware of it or not, under minded his entire film by adding that song. Why? Well, it broke the magic, it reminded people that they were watching a movie, reducing the story of a people&#8217;s struggle for freedom, to date night.All in all, I really enjoyed this film. I was grateful that someone wanted to use time and money to make such a film. Aung San Suu Kyi asked the world once to use their liberty to promote the liberty of the Burmese people and making such a film is doing just that. I was glad to learn that Michelle Yeoh truly cares about this topic and the Nobel Peace Prize recipient that this film was more than a career move, but a labor of love. I highly recommend taking the time to watch this film and learn about one of humanities greatest examples of compassion and liberty, The Lady Aung San Suu Kyi.",5,Voices Raised for The

1553659,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B008I34Y2Q,The Guardian,"[2, 2]","In this excellent Anglo-French production, director Luc Besson has chosen to tell the story of Aung San Suu Kyi through the experience of her marriage to Oxford academic Michael Aris (an intelligent and sensitive performance by David Thewlis). The film explores the heartache of a family life characterised by long separations due to Suu's choice to commit her life first and foremost to democracy and civil rights in her native Burma, and the resultant choices and sacrifices which both agree to endure for the cause.What might in the hands of a less skilled director have turned into a political polemic, or worse, a worthy but uninvolving biopic, has become under Besson's skilled direction a truly great film with a strong storyline and real emotional power. The action see-saws between Suu's struggles against the regime in Burma and Michael's safe, suburban academic life in Oxford, highlighting his unquestioning support for her decision even though it means she is absent from her children growing through adolescence, and of course from him. Whilst stopping short of doing Suu actual harm because her high public profile would bring down the outrage of the international community, the military regime in Burma does everything possible to make her leave Burma `voluntarily' - but she refuses to go, knowing that if she were to leave, new laws would be framed by the regime to ensure she would never be allowed back and she could be far less effective outside the country.The audience is not spared graphic images of the horrors perpetrated by the Burmese regime. The violence however is in no way gratuitous, but essential to the action and to the story. The less well-known struggles of Michael in the background - bringing up the teenage boys on his own, lobbying for his wife to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to attract international news coverage & so add a layer of protection for her, missing her but uncomplaining - are well portrayed by Thewlis, whose performance is noble, intelligent and understated, and capped off by his brief cameos as Michael's identical-twin brother.Michelle Yeoh remains the shining star of the film. Her portrayal of Aung San Suu Kyi runs the full gamut of the emotional spectrum while remaining noble and dignified in the face of ever-mounting indignities. She also learned Burmese (!) for the role, delivering Suu's public speeches in front of large crowds in the Burmese language with utter conviction. You will believe absolutely that Yeoh is Aung San Suu Kyi, clearly understanding the difficult choices she made and their consequences.The film would be worth five stars just for Yeoh's stellar performance, but in fact `The Lady' is a finely crafted and emotionally involving film with no weak performances.

1553660,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B008I34Y2Q,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 9]","""The Lady,"" a biographical picture of Aung San Suu Kyi, is directed by Luc Besson, best known for his ""La Femme Nikita,"" ""L&eacute;on: The Professional"" and ""The Fifth Element."" Michelle Yeoh plays the role of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burmese political and human rights activist. David Thewlis is her husband Dr. Michael Aris. (Thewlis also plays his twin brother Anthony.)""The Lady"" starts in 1947. General Aung San was assassinated when his daughter Aung San Suu Kyi was only two years old. About forty years later, Aung San Suu Kyi, now living in Oxford with her husband and two sons, receives a call from Burma. Her mother is ill and in hospital. Aung San Suu Kyi flies back to Burma, where, witnessing the student protests and the bloody suppression of it, she decides to stay and become a leader of the movement for democracy.Yes, it's Luc Besson and his usual collaborators cinematographer Thierry Arbogast and composer Eric Serra. Unlike in most of his films (including his recent ""Arthur"" trilogy),  his new film is not about a fantastical universe or underworld based on his wild imagination, but about a real-life person who is alive and in the middle of her political career. Actually, Besson made a ""bio-pic"" once, but I don't think historical accuracy was priority No.1 in making ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" for him.While following her life as a political activist in Burma, Besson also tries to tell us a story of her relationship with her husband Michael Aris. In this way we get to see both her public and private face but despite the film's touching finale, ""The Lady"" suffers from its uneven pace that sometimes feels rushed. Most people other than Aung San Suu Kyi, and Michael Aris - generals, soldiers or citizens, whether Burmese or British - are relegated to caricatures or cyphers.Acting is excellent. Michelle Yeoh plays the role of Aung San Suu Kyi with grace and dignity while David Thewlis turns in a moving performance as her husband supporting her even when he is thousands of miles away from her. Their strong bond is the driving force of the film, accompanied by the compelling photography.""The Lady"" puts more focus on the relationship between Aung San Suu Kyi and Michael Aris, than her political career, for better or for worse. As a love story it works, thanks to the strong performances from the leads; as a biographical picture of Aung San Suu Kyi as one of the world's most iconic figures, perhaps we should wait for another film to be made, or read books.",3,(3.5 STARS) Luc Besson's Bio-pic of Aung San Suu Kyi Looks More Like a Love Story,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,2503,"['Lady', 'biographical', 'picture', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'directed', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'best', 'known', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'L', 'eacute', 'Professional', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'role', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'Burmese', 'political', 'human', 'rights', 'activist', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'husband', 'Dr.', 'Michael', 'Aris', 'Thewlis', 'also', 'twin', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'Lady', '1947', 'General', 'Aung', 'San', 'was', 'assassinated', 'when', 'daughter', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'was', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'now', 'living', 'Oxford', 'husband', 'two', 'sons', 'call', 'Burma', 'mother', 'ill', 'hospital', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'back', 'Burma', 'where', 'witnessing', 'student', 'protests', 'bloody', 'suppression', 'stay', 'become', 'leader', 'movement', 'democracy.Yes', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'usual', 'collaborators', 'cinematographer', 'Thierry', 'Arbogast', 'composer', 'Eric', 'Serra', 'most', 'films', 'including', 'recent', 'Arthur', 'trilogy', 'new', 'film', 'not', 'fantastical', 'universe', 'underworld', 'based', 'wild', 'imagination', 'real-life', 'person', 'who', 'alive', 'middle', 'political', 'career', 'Actually', 'Besson', 'made', 'bio-pic', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'was', 'priority', 'No.1', 'making', 'Messenger', 'Story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'him.While', 'following', 'life', 'political', 'activist', 'Burma', 'Besson', 'also', 'tell', 'story', 'relationship', 'husband', 'Michael', 'Aris', 'way', 'get', 'see', 'public', 'private', 'face', 'film', 'touching', 'finale', 'Lady', 'suffers', 'uneven', 'pace', 'sometimes', 'rushed', 'Most', 'people', 'other', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'Michael', 'Aris', 'generals', 'soldiers', 'citizens', 'Burmese', 'British', 'are', 'relegated', 'caricatures', 'cyphers.Acting', 'excellent', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'role', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'grace', 'dignity', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'moving', 'performance', 'husband', 'supporting', 'even', 'when', 'thousands', 'miles', 'away', 'strong', 'bond', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'accompanied', 'compelling', 'photography', 'Lady', 'more', 'focus', 'relationship', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'Michael', 'Aris', 'political', 'career', 'better', 'worse', 'love', 'story', 'thanks', 'strong', 'performances', 'leads', 'biographical', 'picture', 'Aung', 'San', 'Suu', 'Kyi', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'iconic', 'figures', 'perhaps', 'should', 'wait', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'read', 'books']",N/A
