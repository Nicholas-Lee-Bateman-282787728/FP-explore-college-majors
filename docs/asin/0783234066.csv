Lynch ""The Magic Dragon""","[0, 0]","The Land Before Time is a wonderful movie about a group of five young dinosaurs looking for the Great Valley, the only source of food and water left in their world. Balancing humourous, dramatic, and scary scenes in equal measure, it's an excellent film, particularly for the young.The animation in this movie is excellent. The adult dinosaurs can be a bit awkward looking at times, but the main characters are always exquisite, and there's one scene in particular where a group of flying dinos fight over a berry that's brilliance.It's a great movie for kids, and adults will like it too.

Marred slightly by the onslaught of inferior sequels (admittedly, I have not seen them all), `The Land Before Time' is an original and moving story of friendship and survival that blossoms gradually in a film that relies on true emotional connection and subtle plot development.  The film has a purposefully restrained pacing which outlines the perils and adventures that abound in a relaxed light, allowing the audience to really follow and become a part of the story.`The Land Before Time' tells the story of young orphaned Littlefoot, a brontosaurus who takes on a journey to find the Great Valley, a place filled with vegetation where the dinosaurs can live in peace and harmony.  He is accompanied by friends of varied species who are attempting to reconnect with their families in the Valley.  Expressing the power of friendship and the life lesson that friends can come in all shapes and sizes (and loyalty is something that cannot be taken for granted), this film is a beautifully well rounded film that one cannot help but be affected by.Yes, this brings back so many childhood memories, and it is something that still touches my heart (that finale always brings a tear to my eyes).

Just like alot of other early Don Bluth films it was darker than most children films of its time and had many intense moments. Compared to Secret of NIHM its a little more child friendly, but still mature in many aspects. It makes me wonder why they started turning it into a musical series when the first one had no singing at all. Don't get me wrong I loved some of the sequals, but after I think the 4 or 5 it just got ridiculus. Well anyway for one you have one of the saddest moments ever in a kids film at the beginning of the movie. I tell you till this day that scene pulls at my heart strings. It was just tragic and brutal. Then you have 5 young dinosaurs in a world full of danger and destruction, search for a safe place that may or may not exist, but its the only hope that keeps them going. Plus they must deal with living with each other which isn't always easy to do. I'm not sure about the DVD, but the VHS of this was great. The colors and animation was just perfect and I hope the DVD is just as perfect. You care about every character in this movie and wish for them to pull through. I must confess the ending also had me in tears for reasons I can't explain. The Land Before Time is a beautiful and very underrated film. I recommend it to everyone.

Not profound or anything, or even particularly accurate scientifically, but good fun. I was going to say ""good clean fun,"" but there is an incident in the tar pits . . .Littlefoot is a long-neck, Cera is a three-horn, Ducky is a big mouth, Petrie is a pterodactyl and Spike is a stegosaurus. They are all baby dinosaurs that got separated from their families when an earthquake hit. Great herds were on there way to the Great Valley when the earthquake happened, as the land was changing and green food was scarce. They paused only long enough to hatch their babies.Littlefoot's mother died saving him from a Sharp Tooth (Tyrannosaurus Rex), but tells him to follow the big circle in the sky every day (i.e., go west, young dinosaur) past the mountain that looks like a long-neck and the mountains that are on fire.Cera (pronounced ""Sarah"") was told by her father that three-horns never have anything to do with long-necks, and so she's determined to go her own way. But there are plenty of dangers along the way, and she eventually realizes that she needs to stick with the others. The five all have different voices, manner of speaking, personalities. You can get to see them as individuals partly because of that and partly because there is only one of each species. That is, they look vastly different.Yes, of course they eventually find the Great Valley, and their families. Littlefoot finds his grandparents, since his mother is dead; Cera finds her father, and the rest find their mothers. And yes, it's a lovely valley with plenty of food for all.

She has learned their names, and it's not uncommon to hear her talk about what the diplodocus or dinonychus in her collection is doing, usually using those names (and those like them) in her play.Part of that is thanks to this film and its sequels.  This Spielberg-produced animated film introduces us to the characters, a mixed bag of young vegetarian dinos and their search for ""The Great Valley,"" a place where ""sharptooth"" dinosaurs won't hunt them; a place where vegetation for their kind is plentiful.The whole series is certainly recommended, due to its quality and its execution.  Children can certainly identify with the varied personalities of the friends; the curious Littlefoot, the headstrong Cera, the timid Ducky, the less eloquent Petrie, and the mellow but large Spike.  The films teach the value of friendship, accepting each other's differences, working together, and respecting your elders while still testing what they have to say.All of that is a difficult tightrope to walk, and those in charge do it consistently well throughout the series.  A new edition is apparently issued near the beginning of each Christmas season (imagine that) so if your little one is approaching preschool age you should let them view this one to see if it's a series they'll enjoy.....and if it's one you'll approve of as much as we do at our house.

This is a great movie, like An American Tail, and has a great score composed by James Horner and played by the London Symphony Orchestra (with the King's College Choir).  The animation is pretty decent, some of the scenes (like the one near the end where Spike and Ducky slide across a shallow pool of water) are very nice.  The story is pretty basic, but enjoyable for kids and adults (I saw this as a teen in the theaters).  The characters are mostly very cute and charming, especially Ducky and Petri.And YET, this DVD sucks really bad and no one should buy it.  This DVD is NOT widescreen or anamorphic at all.  It's pretty shameful when EVEN Disney is making their DVDs widescreen.  Furthermore, there are absolutely NO extras on this DVD.  I would have especially appreciated to have trailers, tv spots, audio commentary by Bluth (or others), making of feature, etc.  At the very least, widescreen and a trailer.  Yes, this is a children's movie, but that doesn't mean it has to be fullscreen!  It doesn't take much to put in both full and widescreen versions either.

I will agree with those who feel that ""The Land Before Time"" (hereafter TLBT) is an emotionally rousing, exciting, harrowing, life-affirming prehistoric dinosaur fable espousing the strength of brotherhood, friendship, perseverence, and even spirituality.  You will encounter feisty, lively, contentious, but endearing characters, a frequently hellish environment, titanic natural disasters, a legendary antagonist (i.e. a demonic-looking sharptooth), a mother's heroic death, and even courage and guidance from ""above"" as our five dinosaur juvenile protagonists seek their leafy, edenic valley.  TLBT is ambitious, rip-roaring, a tad overwrought and cloying, but ultimately a great instructive story for children AND adults.The only real issue with TLBT is the old ""Herbivores Good, Carnivores Bad"" fallacy.  Perhaps it's unavoidable, since any cinematic animal fable, Disney or Dreamworks or Pixar or otherwise, needs a villain for drama and moral counterpoint.  And of course, a colossal, nimble, ferocious, and determined sharp-toothed T-Rex certainly fits the bill.  Hey, if you're an adult, you suspend disbelief and go with it.  I just hope that parents that watch TLBT with their children explain to them at some point that the T-Rex is not chasing Littlefoot the apatosaurus, Cera the triceratops, Ducky the hadrosaurus, Petrie the pterosaur, and Spike the stegosaurus just to be a mean bully.  To T-Rex, they are just food and they have to eat meat to survive.  Conversely, herbivores are not always good and gentle.  I actually appreciated how TLBT gave us a herbivore like Cera, who can be bossy, obstinate, opinionated, and even cruel (takes after her old man a little bit).  She counterbalances some of the gentler characters.I know, TLBT is not supposed to be naturalistic.  If you wanted to be a petty spoilsport, you could single out some improbabilities (e.g. dinosaurs don't have prehensile tails, pterodactyls eat fish, not berries).  But at the same time, after enjoying TLBT with the kids, you should take the time to expand their curiosity about dinosaurs by explaining more about their true natures, especially as they get older.

As it turned out, both my children and my wife and I like the movie immensely.The touching story of Little Foot, the last remaining member of his family of Brontosauruses (Brontosauri?), is a great adventure as well.  He joins up with younger members of other dinosaur families as they all journey to the Great Valley in search of food.Along the way they encounter hunger, thirst, earthquakes, and, not least of all, the dreaded Sharptooth.  The feel of the dinosaur age is well presented and the characters are cute without being saccharine (and they don't sing!).The lesson that friends can be friends even though they don't look like you or act just like you is a nice one for kids to see.  The idea that working together is important for reaching a goal is also a valuable one.Having owned a VHS copy of the movie, I was anxious to see the DVD.  The result on this particular version is very dissappointing.First, the version is full-screen with no wide-screen option. This seems to be a minor problem since most of the action seems to take place center screen.  It would have been nice to have the option for widescreen, however.Secondly, the color and brightness varies widely from scene to scene (and, more jarringly, sometimes within a scene).  The opening scene, which starts underwater, is actually darker and less sharp than on the VHS version.  In several quiet, close-up scenes the picture will be perfectly exposed and then the picture will shift to a darker look and then back.  Very annoying.  Various nicks and scratches appear throughout the film - it appears that no effort was made to clean up the video master at all.There were also no extras on the disc at all, and at the price of this DVD, you would expect a little more than just the movie and chapter selections.

It looked like it would have been decent animation, definitely without the detail of some movies, but it was so grainy and not crisp at all-- so I blame the DVD, because I've seen other Bluth films with animation that blew me away.  So this movie's animation looks much older than it is with all the graininess.  I should have listened to others' reviews that said this was a very poor quality release of a film they love.  It was also dull because of so much brown, orange and yellow due to the land they traveled.  Not very appealing to the eye.But the story is more important than the look, and I found that heavy.  They tried to lighten it up, but really, it was a downer.  There was a violent scene early on in the film, and the mom died.  How sad for her son to see this and have to travel on his own until he met some young friends.  It was sad and not uplifting even when they finally reached their goal in the end after such a long journey.

However, even in fullscreen format, the light and shade in this movie... both in the art, and in the drama... is superb.The absence of songs is not a problem; children have more power of discernment than they are given credit for, and if the sequels ( which I also love) had no songs, and concentrated on the story more directly, then they would appeal more to Adults as well as children.This first film laid a high production value that the studio has failed to stick to, or even surpass.I suspect that we have either wacko conservative parents, or some biased screen testing to thank for the sequels that fail to live up to the quality of the first film.Don't get me wrong, I love the sequels enough to have bought everyone I have been aware of, and to date, I think I have missed only 2-3.I would not class this film as either an Adult or a child's film; simply put, a good film is a good film, and Don Bluth does a great job.The songs in the sequels are clearly for cross-merchandising... which I don't deny is a legitimate sales point for the studio.

Espinoza ""critic""","[0, 1]","so this dvd is in pretty good condition, meaning the film was transferred to disc decently. i wouldn't call this dvd quality, but its just under dvd quality. in the beginning of the film it starts of a little grainy and blurry, but slightly, it than clears up pretty nicely once you see the dinosaurs. so dont get scared when the first 30 seconds or so are a lil off. it is a real old film and to my knowledge it wasn't digitally remastered. But i believe they used a really well kept film master, so in the end its a step up from our old VHS tapes of this movie. The sound comes in very nicely, there is english audio, spanish and french audio as well, theres also english for hard of hearing and french and spanish subtitles. I wish they had included the original theatrical trailer for this film but thats ok, the special features i haven't seen and really aren't the reason we are buying this classic film. i had this vhs tape back when i was 5, and am now 30 and just seeing little foot yawn just before going to sleep on his mothers back gave me such a nostalgic feeling and happiness. i'm glad i got to own this once again after all these years, decades even.so for those saying the video quality is horrible, please ignore them. yes, the film is old, but its been kept pretty well over the years, i am satisfied with the quality of the film. if anything its like a perfect vhs tape quality film.**UPDATE**i saw the entire film the other night, and i have to say the quality really held up. I assume they must of used a VHS tape master. It held up great, even on my 42"" LED TV. there were no errors of any kind, video or audio. everything was great. Looking back at the film, it seems there may have been a couple of scenes that just didnt make it to the theatrical version. I have no proof of this, but there are a couple of scenes in the middle of the movie that point out that there was prolly an idea to make the scene longer but for whatever reason either took it out or it never came to pass. but it was still a great movie from beginning to end. i had forgotten diana ross sung the ending credits. the special features arent really all that for the adult buyer. they are lil kids games. one such feature shows how to navigate a remote controller for the youngin's out there. this is a great purchase, ignore those idiotic buyers that are hating on it for not being in widescreen.
