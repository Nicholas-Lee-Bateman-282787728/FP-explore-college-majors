To top it off my case was literally crushed during shipment.  No exaggeration there - many pieces so small I had to vac them up!  The disc was not broken but still would not play.  BTW - Amazon did reimburse me for this one.  But I have since bought it elsewhere in one piece.  I understand now why Amazon let it get broken.  Ok, ok, that's not fair, it's not like they did it on purpose...  In all honesty though after watching it one must wonder.  Presumably this is a to be continued sort of deal.  Why we'd want it to continue is the question.  A VERY long, drawn out and dull film with stretches of pointless scenes designed to fill space and give them an excuse to make part 2 no doubt.  Kirk Jones is not as talented as Wesley Snipes to top it all off.  Though I must confess he did remarkably well all things considered.  Only a major Blade fan should consider buying this and then be ready still for disappointment.  The basic plot is army girl comes home from  war just in time to identify her brother's remains and get sucked into (no pun intended) the world of Vampires and more specifically the House Of Cthon.

Overall, I was impressed by Sticky's performance as Blade, the storyline(and even the flashback footage from the 1st Blade film) gave it an authentic feel, I was feelin' the crime family approach to the vampire clan(Chthon), and I agree with many of the other reviews that it was cut off too soon...there was so much more potential left for the series to grow and become a classic out of this world. However, my review is short 2 stars, and this is just my opinion, because 2 areas were lacking in the series premiere: (1)Sticky vs Wesley: While Wesley Snipes, a martial artist in his own right, had Blade lookin' like a black Neo, my boy Sticky was lookin' like he was havin' a hard time shakin' off the underlings...no fault of his own, but the fight choreography could've been more convincing to make him look like the daywalker his character is supposed to be...(2)between the open and close, the progression tends to be quite drawn out and slow with some action/murder spurts here and there...which was about the only thing that caused the series premiere to stand out like a sore thumb in comparison/contrast to the movie trilogy.Don't get me wrong...I agree that Sticky has the charisma to be Blade, but I feel that they didn't work with him as intensely as they did with Wesley.",3,It's Iight: Sticky vs Wesley,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,1644,"['Now', 'get', 'stoned', 'death', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'comic', 'book', 'Onyx/Sticky', 'etc', 'not', 'givin', 'production', 'strong', '5', 'lem', 'go', 'say', 'favor', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'performance', 'Blade', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'DO', 'feel', 'Sticky', 'succeeded', 'holdin', 'own', 'not', 'attempting', 'mimick', 'Wesley', 'give', 'Blade', 'new', 'light', 'altogether', 'Overall', 'was', 'impressed', 'Sticky', 'performance', 'Blade', 'storyline', 'even', 'flashback', 'footage', '1st', 'Blade', 'film', 'gave', 'authentic', 'feel', 'was', 'feelin', 'crime', 'family', 'approach', 'vampire', 'clan', 'Chthon', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'cut', 'off', 'too', 'soon', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'potential', 'left', 'series', 'grow', 'become', 'classic', 'out', 'world', 'However', 'review', 'short', '2', 'stars', 'just', 'opinion', '2', 'areas', 'were', 'lacking', 'series', 'premiere', '1', 'Sticky', 'vs', 'Wesley', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'martial', 'artist', 'own', 'right', 'had', 'Blade', 'lookin', 'black', 'Neo', 'boy', 'Sticky', 'was', 'lookin', 'was', 'havin', 'hard', 'time', 'shakin', 'underlings', 'fault', 'own', 'fight', 'choreography', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'convincing', 'make', 'look', 'daywalker', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', '2', 'open', 'close', 'progression', 'be', 'quite', 'drawn', 'out', 'slow', 'action/murder', 'spurts', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'caused', 'series', 'premiere', 'stand', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'comparison/contrast', 'movie', 'trilogy.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'agree', 'Sticky', 'charisma', 'be', 'Blade', 'feel', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'intensely', 'did', 'Wesley']",Blade - House of Chthon

The first hip hop cd I ever bought on my own was ONYX, so I was a fan of Sticky, but it did take some adjustment to see him as Blade.  I dont think it was his fault, Wesley Snipes created the role like Christopher Reeves did Superman, Michael Keaton did Batman or even how Robert Englunds did Freddy.  There is a new Superman and Batman, but (especially in Superman Returns) the standard was set with the original movies.  Wesley Snipes is Blade, it will take alot to take that title from him.  With that said, Sticky technically played Blade like Snipes... very little dialogue, moody, mean, and no emotion.  The main difference is that I was always aware that Snipes is a martial artist and Sticky got beat up by some fat rock kid on a mtv show back in the day.  Anyways... it wasnt the pilot, but at some point I didnt even think about the differences and just accepted Sticky as Blade.  Like most shows, the first season is good, but I had a feeling the second season was going to take it to the next level.  The show was indepth with Blades history... and there was even an epsiode (my favorite) that gave indepth look into Marcus history.  There was some good episodes, good characters, and good effects.  Blade and Blade II are classics in my book, but Blade III was poorly directed and edited... watchable only because I'm a fan.  In my opionion this tv show would've saved the Blade Saga, because Blade III killed my interest in seeing another movie.  I'm probably buying this disc, but I'm not sure if I should wait for the whole series to come out.

1083156,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000RO6KAS,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[20, 34]","With Wesley Snipes having enough of being Blade, the series and Marvel character made the transformation from feature film series to television.  Blade: House of Chthon is the pilot of the TV series that premiered on Spike TV, and featured rapper Kirk ""Sticky Fingaz"" Jones as the super human vampire hunter, which in itself helps kill the series right off the bat.  Blade teams up with Iraq war veteran Krista (Jill Wagner, better known as the girl from the Mercury car commercials) whose brother was a vampire familiar and was murdered for something he knew.  This leads them to a powerful and dangerous vamp named Marcus Van Sciver (Neil Jackson) who has big plans for both species.  Though it had film trilogy writer David S. Goyer and celebrated comic writer Geoff Johns behind it, the Blade series just never excelled the way it could have, and this pilot is no different.  The acting is pretty bad all around, and the overall story never picked up and got really interesting until the end of the series, and by that time, it was already too late.  Jones just comes off as lame and just doesn't have that opposing charisma that Snipes posessed, plus the Blade character just seems so weak willed compared to what we've seen before.  There are some good ideas, hot women (Wagner and Jessica Gower), and some nifty TV effects as well, but in the end, this is an ultimate failure.  Not to mention that it's inevitable for the whole series to make it's way to DVD, of which this pilot will most likely be included.  If you're a Blade fan and missed the series when originally aired, this may be worth a look, and if you were one of the few who actually enjoyed the series (it was canceled due to poor ratings and the overall negative reactions from fans of the films), this ""extended"" DVD may be worth picking up.",2,Blade on TV doesn't work,1183161600,"06 30, 2007",2007,1815,"['Wesley', 'Snipes', 'having', 'enough', 'being', 'Blade', 'series', 'Marvel', 'character', 'made', 'transformation', 'feature', 'film', 'series', 'television', 'House', 'Chthon', 'pilot', 'TV', 'series', 'premiered', 'Spike', 'TV', 'featured', 'rapper', 'Kirk', 'Sticky', 'Fingaz', 'Jones', 'super', 'human', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'kill', 'series', 'right', 'bat', 'Blade', 'teams', 'up', 'Iraq', 'war', 'veteran', 'Krista', 'Jill', 'Wagner', 'better', 'known', 'girl', 'Mercury', 'car', 'commercials', 'brother', 'was', 'vampire', 'familiar', 'was', 'murdered', 'something', 'knew', 'powerful', 'dangerous', 'vamp', 'named', 'Marcus', 'Van', 'Sciver', 'Neil', 'Jackson', 'who', 'big', 'plans', 'species', 'had', 'film', 'trilogy', 'writer', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'celebrated', 'comic', 'writer', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'Blade', 'series', 'just', 'never', 'excelled', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'pilot', 'different', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'overall', 'story', 'never', 'picked', 'up', 'got', 'really', 'interesting', 'end', 'series', 'time', 'was', 'already', 'too', 'late', 'Jones', 'just', 'off', 'lame', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'opposing', 'charisma', 'Snipes', 'posessed', 'Blade', 'character', 'just', 'so', 'weak', 'willed', 'compared', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'are', 'good', 'ideas', 'hot', 'women', 'Wagner', 'Jessica', 'Gower', 'nifty', 'TV', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'ultimate', 'failure', 'Not', 'mention', 'inevitable', 'whole', 'series', 'make', 'way', 'DVD', 'pilot', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'included', ""'re"", 'Blade', 'fan', 'missed', 'series', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'may', 'be', 'look', 'were', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'was', 'canceled', 'due', 'poor', 'ratings', 'overall', 'negative', 'reactions', 'fans', 'films', 'extended', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'picking', 'up']",Blade - House of Chthon

It is the pilot episodes for the series.  So if you are getting the DVD of the series, don't get this.Also be warned that these two episodes or pilot movie has some serious problems with how they are formatted and it appears to be on purpose.
