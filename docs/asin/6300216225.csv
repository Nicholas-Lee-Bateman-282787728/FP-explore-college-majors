220380,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300216225,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","This sweet and charming little musical from 1974 feels very classic in construction and very much like the children&#8217;s films of the 70&#8217;s (a tad darker than expected and deeper upon reflection) and for that, I was grateful.  It didn&#8217;t always hold the attention of my children (there are dry moments) but the visual grace of the film (man, is that cinematography brilliant) helps keep your attention focused on the screen even when the action is low.Telling the story of a pilot, discouraged from his childhood fantasies by adults too mature for their own good, &#8216;The Little Prince&#8217; has this pilot encounter a strange young child from another world after he crash lands in the desert.  The young boy tells the man stories of oppression from adults and strange encounters with snakes (an obvious biblical reference and nod to Satan) and foxes before the man is able to once again embrace his youthful innocence.  It&#8217;s a beautifully told story of lost innocence and the desire to once again grab hold of it.  Stanley Donen uses from serious visual style to tell his story, but he understands needed restraint while impacting the emotions.  The cast is uniformly fine, with no one really excelling.  Bob Fosse is a tad awkward and Steven Warner is not the best child actor, but Gene Wilder is always charming and fluid, and Richard Kiley balances out the needed emotions well.It&#8217;s a nice family film that works on many levels and for many ages.",4,Charm and poignancy collide&#8230;,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,1479,"['sweet', 'charming', 'little', 'musical', '1974', 'feels', 'very', 'classic', 'construction', 'very', 'much', 'children', '8217', 's', 'films', '70', '8217', 's', 'tad', 'darker', 'expected', 'deeper', 'reflection', 'was', 'grateful', '8217', 'always', 'hold', 'attention', 'children', 'are', 'dry', 'moments', 'visual', 'grace', 'film', 'man', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'keep', 'attention', 'focused', 'screen', 'even', 'when', 'action', 'low.Telling', 'story', 'pilot', 'discouraged', 'childhood', 'fantasies', 'adults', 'too', 'mature', 'own', 'good', '8216', 'Little', 'Prince', '8217', 'pilot', 'encounter', 'strange', 'young', 'child', 'world', 'crash', 'lands', 'desert', 'young', 'boy', 'man', 'stories', 'oppression', 'adults', 'strange', 'encounters', 'snakes', 'obvious', 'biblical', 'reference', 'nod', 'Satan', 'man', 'able', 'once', 'again', 'embrace', 'youthful', 'innocence', '8217', 's', 'beautifully', 'told', 'story', 'lost', 'innocence', 'desire', 'once', 'again', 'grab', 'hold', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'serious', 'visual', 'style', 'tell', 'story', 'needed', 'restraint', 'impacting', 'emotions', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'fine', 'one', 'really', 'excelling', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'tad', 'awkward', 'Steven', 'Warner', 'not', 'best', 'child', 'actor', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'always', 'charming', 'fluid', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'balances', 'out', 'needed', 'emotions', 'well.It', '8217', 's', 'nice', 'family', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'many', 'ages']",Little Prince VHS

Since then, it has been one of my favorite films of my childhood.  I never read the book, or saw any other adaptations of the story. Yet, several of the actors (Bob Fosse, Gene Wilder, Richard Kiley, Joss Ackland, Carol Lawrence and a LONG PRE Waiting For God Graham Crowden) in their ""younger and more formidable years"" give performances that would be as first rate as the other roles they would be remembered most for today.  Steven Warner in the title role is a delight, and on star filled nights now 30+ years later, I can still hear him laughing.  Until this film, I never knew Kiley could sing, but since buying this film on disc, I find my self singing ""It's A Hat/I Need Air"" with an alarming degree of frequency.

220385,A14PWKNFN0K560,6300216225,John D. Bartone,"[3, 3]","I remember this movie opening to very mixed reviews back in 1974, and so I avoided it for over 30 years.  But I recently reread the book (highly recommended for adults as well as children, by the way) and became curious about this adaptation.  Although there are a couple of serious problems with this film, it is, on the whole, a surprisingly enjoyable and moving viewing experience.  For the most part, the problems are limited to the first half of the film, so if you stick with it that long, the payoff is worth your while.First of all, that Lerner and Lowe score is a mixed bag at best.  But the score improves remarkably in the second half of the film, and the best of it is winning.  Secondly, the depiction of the rose is flawed.  Gene Wilder's Fox and Bob Fosse's Snake, both wonderful here, are able to step out of their animal skins once their characters are economically established.  This frees up their performances considerably.  We see their faces clearly, they interact with the Little Prince directly, movement helps define their characters.  But the great dancer Donna McKechnie's entire performance as the Rose is horribly ill-conceived.  Her image is projected onto a red petal, and as a result, she's murky, small, and, worst of all for a dancer, straight-jacketed. The fact that the connection between the Prince and his Rose is not more persuasive is problematic, since the Little Prince's love for the beautiful but petulant Rose informs almost all his actions.That being said, the look and feel of this film is pitch-perfect.  Stanley Donen wisely avoided the typical bloat to which most Hollywood musicals are susceptible.  This Little Prince is intimate in scale.  The musical numbers are mostly solos or duets.  Nothing here overpowers the delicate plot.  The art direction and special effects, particularly during the Prince's interplanetary travels, catch the eye.  The performances, with the exception of the Rose (whose deficiencies are more the fault of the director than Ms. McKechnie), are praiseworthy.  Richard Kiley is appealing and in fine voice as the Pilot.  And Steven Warner is absolutely  beguiling as The Little Prince.Everything pulls together successfully for the last 45 minutes of this film and drives the audience to a touching finale.  And about that snake bite: it is certainly meant to be transformative and transporting rather than suicidal.  It makes complete sense within the context of this tale, and all but the youngest child will grasp this easily.  The Little Prince's peals of laughter filling the night sky make it clear that he has arrived at home safely.This is, overall, a winsome, faithful adaptation of the beloved children's book.",3,Fine Family Fare,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,2700,"['remember', 'movie', 'opening', 'very', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'back', '1974', 'so', 'avoided', '30', 'years', 'recently', 'reread', 'book', 'highly', 'recommended', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'way', 'became', 'curious', 'adaptation', 'are', 'couple', 'serious', 'problems', 'film', 'whole', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'moving', 'viewing', 'experience', 'most', 'part', 'problems', 'are', 'limited', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'so', 'stick', 'long', 'payoff', 'while.First', 'Lerner', 'Lowe', 'score', 'mixed', 'bag', 'best', 'score', 'remarkably', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'best', 'winning', 'Secondly', 'depiction', 'rose', 'flawed', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Fox', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'Snake', 'wonderful', 'here', 'are', 'able', 'step', 'out', 'animal', 'skins', 'once', 'characters', 'are', 'economically', 'established', 'up', 'performances', 'considerably', 'see', 'clearly', 'interact', 'Little', 'Prince', 'directly', 'movement', 'define', 'characters', 'great', 'dancer', 'Donna', 'McKechnie', 'entire', 'performance', 'Rose', 'horribly', 'ill-conceived', 'image', 'projected', 'red', 'petal', 'result', 'murky', 'small', 'worst', 'dancer', 'straight-jacketed', 'fact', 'connection', 'Prince', 'Rose', 'not', 'more', 'persuasive', 'problematic', 'Little', 'Prince', 'love', 'beautiful', 'petulant', 'Rose', 'almost', 'actions.That', 'being', 'said', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'pitch-perfect', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'wisely', 'avoided', 'typical', 'bloat', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'are', 'susceptible', 'Little', 'Prince', 'intimate', 'scale', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'mostly', 'solos', 'duets', 'Nothing', 'here', 'delicate', 'plot', 'art', 'direction', 'special', 'effects', 'particularly', 'Prince', 'interplanetary', 'travels', 'catch', 'eye', 'performances', 'exception', 'Rose', 'deficiencies', 'are', 'more', 'fault', 'director', 'Ms.', 'McKechnie', 'are', 'praiseworthy', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'appealing', 'fine', 'voice', 'Pilot', 'Steven', 'Warner', 'absolutely', 'beguiling', 'Little', 'Prince.Everything', 'together', 'successfully', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'audience', 'touching', 'finale', 'snake', 'bite', 'certainly', 'meant', 'be', 'transformative', 'transporting', 'rather', 'suicidal', 'complete', 'sense', 'context', 'tale', 'youngest', 'child', 'will', 'grasp', 'easily', 'Little', 'Prince', 'peals', 'laughter', 'filling', 'night', 'sky', 'make', 'clear', 'arrived', 'home', 'safely.This', 'overall', 'winsome', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'children', 'book']",Little Prince VHS

220387,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,6300216225,Kendra,"[25, 30]","I saw this film with my grandmother at Radio City Music Hall as a child back in 1974 (I think this is the year).  I had not read the book at that time, and certainly did not like the movie.  Since falling in love with the soundtrack of Le Petit Prince (Richard Cocciante's and Elisabeth Anais's French version), I decided to give this film another look.  Also, it's considered a classic, so I thought maybe I'd like it better now.I did like the main cast. I think Richard Kiley as the aviator was excellent and I very much enjoyed Steven Warner as the Little Prince.  Gene Wilder (the Fox) like always, was great.The movie was really bad, though.  And, the musical score was appalling (I do not use this term lightly)!  The Little Prince, too, is filled with poor melodies and lyrics.  I am not a huge fan of Lerner and Lowe's, but these songs are just really atrocious.  I wound up fast forwarding halfway through most of the songs since they sounded horrid and repetitive.  Worse, they seemed to come out of nowhere with no real transition from dialogue to music.  The Prince's Rose, for instance, said goodbye coyly yet gently but then belted out her obnoxious and brash goodbye song.  And, it was HORRIBLE as were most all the tracks.  Really atrocious stuff. I'm surprised it even passes as music.The main message here is wonderful.  The film does keep the main message, but if you don't know the book, some of the lessons learned and taught are lost in this film.  You reach the same conclusion, because it's spelled out for the watcher, but some lessons (vanity, too much work-not enough play, focus on money) are lost along the way. In addition, the troubled yet charming lamplighter is absent here.  Really, if time was an issue, why not cut out the horrendous musical numbers?  These planetary visits the Prince makes in the book are pretty integral to the story.Again, the scenes between the aviator and the prince were wonderful.  Gene Wilder was excellent.  The supporting cast was okay, but they didn't get the book's points across.I'm surprised anyone thinks this is a classic.  I have not seen the Rachel Portman's operatic version, but I can't sing the praises of Richard Cocciante's and Elisabeth Anais' version (LE PETIT PRINCE) enough.  Although it's not available with English subtitles, it is absolutely wonderful.  And, the lyrics to the songs are almost the exact words that Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote, set to music.  So, if you have the book in English, you can follow along with the dvd film version without any issue.  In fact, the first song, Dedicace, is the exact dedication that Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote, set to music.  And, Daniel Lavoie is perfect as the aviator.  The music to this is truly sublime.",2,I Gave This a Chance despite the first viewing,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,2743,"['saw', 'film', 'grandmother', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'child', 'back', '1974', 'think', 'year', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'time', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'falling', 'love', 'soundtrack', 'Le', 'Petit', 'Prince', 'Richard', 'Cocciante', 'Elisabeth', 'Anais', 'French', 'version', 'decided', 'give', 'film', 'look', 'Also', 'considered', 'classic', 'thought', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'like', 'better', 'now.I', 'did', 'main', 'cast', 'think', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'aviator', 'was', 'excellent', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Steven', 'Warner', 'Little', 'Prince', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Fox', 'always', 'was', 'great.The', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'appalling', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'term', 'lightly', 'Little', 'Prince', 'too', 'filled', 'poor', 'melodies', 'lyrics', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Lerner', 'Lowe', 'songs', 'are', 'just', 'really', 'atrocious', 'wound', 'up', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'halfway', 'most', 'songs', 'sounded', 'horrid', 'repetitive', 'Worse', 'seemed', 'come', 'nowhere', 'real', 'transition', 'dialogue', 'music', 'Prince', 'Rose', 'instance', 'said', 'goodbye', 'coyly', 'yet', 'gently', 'then', 'belted', 'out', 'obnoxious', 'brash', 'goodbye', 'song', 'was', 'HORRIBLE', 'were', 'most', 'tracks', 'Really', 'atrocious', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'even', 'music.The', 'main', 'message', 'here', 'wonderful', 'film', 'keep', 'main', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'book', 'lessons', 'learned', 'taught', 'are', 'lost', 'film', 'reach', 'same', 'conclusion', 'spelled', 'out', 'watcher', 'lessons', 'vanity', 'too', 'much', 'work-not', 'enough', 'play', 'focus', 'money', 'are', 'lost', 'way', 'addition', 'troubled', 'yet', 'charming', 'lamplighter', 'absent', 'here', 'Really', 'time', 'was', 'issue', 'why', 'not', 'cut', 'out', 'horrendous', 'musical', 'numbers', 'planetary', 'visits', 'Prince', 'book', 'are', 'pretty', 'integral', 'story.Again', 'scenes', 'aviator', 'prince', 'were', 'wonderful', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'was', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'book', 'points', 'across.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'anyone', 'classic', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'operatic', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'praises', 'Richard', 'Cocciante', 'Elisabeth', 'Anais', 'version', 'LE', 'PETIT', 'PRINCE', 'enough', 'not', 'available', 'English', 'subtitles', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'are', 'almost', 'exact', 'words', 'Antoine', 'Saint-Exupery', 'wrote', 'set', 'music', 'So', 'have', 'book', 'English', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'dvd', 'film', 'version', 'issue', 'fact', 'first', 'song', 'Dedicace', 'exact', 'dedication', 'Antoine', 'Saint-Exupery', 'wrote', 'set', 'music', 'Daniel', 'Lavoie', 'perfect', 'aviator', 'music', 'truly', 'sublime']",Little Prince VHS

220392,ARI2C0G2PPBO,6300216225,RENS,"[47, 49]","I cannot too highly praise this 1974 film of ""The Little Prince"" produced and directed by Stanley Donen. The presentation is rather that of an American musical or a ""Singspiel"": spoken dialogue interspersed with musical numbers. The lyrics and music of Lerner and Loewe do not terribly impress me but they are suitable and essentially effective.  To my surprise and delight, everything else works: Richard Kiley is absolutely convincing as The Pilot. His acting is first rate, he sings very well indeed, and his handsome, expressive face and athletic body present a Pilot who is at the same time very strong and very gentle. I think of the exuberance of the scene in which he and the Little Prince playfully splash about in the water of the oasis or of the final moments when his sense of loss and sorrow comes across so powerfully as he carries the Little Prince in his arms after the snake has given its gift of transformation and the essence of the child is no longer in his body.  Stephen Warner somehow speaks to me as The Little Prince, Saint-Exupery's Little Prince himself, incarnate in his every word and movement, and in the costuming as well.The irrepressible Gene Wilder brilliantly zips about as a hyper-active and most loveable fox who allows himself (indeed desires)to be tamed at last by love. The great choreographer Bob Fosse, at the height of his career, dances a shifty, jazzy snake, even if the length of the dance is a bit self-indulgent.  The visual movement back and forth between animals and human actors is very effective.  The ballet of the roses is delightfuly reminiscent of a production number in a 1930s Busby Berkley musical.I should mention, in light of an earlier review, that since very ancient times the desert viper has been seen as a creature that both takes and gives life.  The snake is an agent of transformation.  Two snakes entwined on the staff of Hermes (Mercury) still signify the art of the physician and the science of medicine.  The Little Prince does not, in effect, commit suicide; instead, with the help of the snake he ascends to a higher plane; he returns to his beloved planet with its rose and three volcanos.  I have always found that children intuitively understand this, perhaps more easily than many of us adults who have been trained to fear snakes as harbingers of evil rather than as the wonderfully beautiful, lithe and complex creatures that they are.All in all, I find this film a source of great joy and personally prefer it to the more recent operatic version of ""The Little Prince"" also available on DVD.",5,"This charming and faithful film thoroughly ""tamed"" me.",1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,2573,"['can', 'not', 'too', 'highly', 'praise', '1974', 'film', 'Little', 'Prince', 'produced', 'directed', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'presentation', 'rather', 'American', 'musical', 'Singspiel', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'interspersed', 'musical', 'numbers', 'lyrics', 'music', 'Lerner', 'Loewe', 'do', 'not', 'terribly', 'impress', 'are', 'suitable', 'essentially', 'effective', 'surprise', 'delight', 'everything', 'else', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'Pilot', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'handsome', 'expressive', 'face', 'athletic', 'body', 'present', 'Pilot', 'who', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'strong', 'very', 'gentle', 'think', 'exuberance', 'scene', 'Little', 'Prince', 'playfully', 'splash', 'water', 'oasis', 'final', 'moments', 'when', 'sense', 'loss', 'sorrow', 'so', 'powerfully', 'Little', 'Prince', 'arms', 'snake', 'given', 'gift', 'transformation', 'essence', 'child', 'longer', 'body', 'Stephen', 'Warner', 'somehow', 'Little', 'Prince', 'Saint-Exupery', 'Little', 'Prince', 'incarnate', 'word', 'movement', 'costuming', 'well.The', 'irrepressible', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'brilliantly', 'hyper-active', 'most', 'loveable', 'fox', 'who', 'indeed', 'be', 'tamed', 'last', 'love', 'great', 'choreographer', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'height', 'career', 'shifty', 'jazzy', 'snake', 'even', 'length', 'dance', 'bit', 'self-indulgent', 'visual', 'movement', 'back', 'forth', 'animals', 'human', 'actors', 'very', 'effective', 'ballet', 'roses', 'delightfuly', 'reminiscent', 'production', 'number', '1930s', 'Busby', 'Berkley', 'musical.I', 'should', 'mention', 'light', 'earlier', 'review', 'very', 'ancient', 'times', 'desert', 'viper', 'been', 'seen', 'creature', 'life', 'snake', 'agent', 'transformation', 'Two', 'snakes', 'entwined', 'staff', 'Hermes', 'Mercury', 'still', 'signify', 'art', 'physician', 'science', 'medicine', 'Little', 'Prince', 'not', 'effect', 'commit', 'suicide', 'instead', 'help', 'snake', 'higher', 'plane', 'beloved', 'planet', 'rose', 'three', 'volcanos', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'children', 'intuitively', 'understand', 'perhaps', 'more', 'easily', 'many', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'trained', 'fear', 'snakes', 'harbingers', 'evil', 'rather', 'wonderfully', 'beautiful', 'lithe', 'complex', 'creatures', 'are.All', 'find', 'film', 'source', 'great', 'joy', 'personally', 'prefer', 'more', 'recent', 'operatic', 'version', 'Little', 'Prince', 'also', 'available', 'DVD']",Little Prince VHS

The little, nameless prince comments about his flower/friend who is his sole companion of his tiny planet whilst roaming through fields of wild rose bushes on planet earth.  I haven't read the book, yet the boa constrictor story is in both.  I know this because I once tried to read The Little Prince in Spanish to a little hispanic girl who started laughing hysterically when I got to the boa constrictor that ate an elephant part of the story.  My rudimentary Spanish did not include the Spanish word for boa constrictor in my  vocabulary, so I was totally clueless as to her reaction.  I had to ask her to explain to me in her rudimentary English, the story.  (So much for my bilingual story telling days!)  I do like the movie, though it's a bit dated and a little strange!  I'm not so bothered about the fact that the little prince decides to seal his fate by becoming prey to a poisonous snake.  What would you do if you were stranded in the middle of the Sahara desert with no one to take you back to your tiny planet, no telling how many light years away?  I'm no judge of content appropriate for small children, not being a parent myself, yet if you consider when Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry wrote the book, in 1943, and think of the fate of so many innocent children in Europe and elsewhere in the world during the world wars, I think one would realize that, unfortunately, little children are so many times witnesses and victims of so many terrible, and terrifying things.  Perhaps, Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry was trying to make some sense of that sort of tragedy in his book since he was actively involved in fighting for the French in WWII.  I love the story of the friendship that develops between the stranded pilot and the extraterrestrial, little prince which is mainly the plot of the whole story.  Watching the movie I was reminded of so many biblical themes, of wanderings, temptations in deserts, the fall of man in Genesis, of the symbolism of water in religious rituals, and of life's basic necessities such as friendship, love, food and water.  Plus, there are so many wise proverbs said by the little prince and his lost aviator companion to entertain.",4,"""If she learns that there are hundreds of flowers...""",1113177600,"04 11, 2005",2005,2232,"['just', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'little', 'nameless', 'prince', 'comments', 'flower/friend', 'who', 'sole', 'companion', 'tiny', 'planet', 'whilst', 'roaming', 'fields', 'wild', 'rose', 'bushes', 'planet', 'earth', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'boa', 'constrictor', 'story', 'know', 'once', 'tried', 'read', 'Little', 'Prince', 'Spanish', 'little', 'hispanic', 'girl', 'who', 'started', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'when', 'got', 'boa', 'constrictor', 'ate', 'elephant', 'part', 'story', 'rudimentary', 'Spanish', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'Spanish', 'word', 'boa', 'constrictor', 'vocabulary', 'was', 'totally', 'clueless', 'reaction', 'had', 'ask', 'explain', 'rudimentary', 'English', 'story', 'So', 'much', 'bilingual', 'story', 'telling', 'days', 'do', 'movie', 'bit', 'dated', 'little', 'strange', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'bothered', 'fact', 'little', 'prince', 'decides', 'seal', 'fate', 'becoming', 'prey', 'poisonous', 'snake', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'stranded', 'middle', 'Sahara', 'desert', 'one', 'take', 'back', 'tiny', 'planet', 'telling', 'how', 'many', 'light', 'years', 'away', ""'m"", 'judge', 'content', 'appropriate', 'small', 'children', 'not', 'being', 'parent', 'yet', 'consider', 'when', 'Antoine', 'Saint-Exup', 'eacute', 'wrote', 'book', '1943', 'think', 'fate', 'so', 'many', 'innocent', 'children', 'Europe', 'elsewhere', 'world', 'world', 'wars', 'think', 'one', 'would', 'realize', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'children', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'witnesses', 'victims', 'so', 'many', 'terrible', 'terrifying', 'things', 'Perhaps', 'Antoine', 'Saint-Exup', 'eacute', 'ry', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'sort', 'tragedy', 'book', 'was', 'actively', 'involved', 'fighting', 'French', 'WWII', 'love', 'story', 'friendship', 'stranded', 'pilot', 'extraterrestrial', 'little', 'prince', 'mainly', 'plot', 'whole', 'story', 'Watching', 'movie', 'was', 'reminded', 'so', 'many', 'biblical', 'themes', 'wanderings', 'temptations', 'deserts', 'fall', 'man', 'Genesis', 'symbolism', 'water', 'religious', 'rituals', 'life', 'basic', 'necessities', 'such', 'friendship', 'love', 'food', 'water', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'wise', 'proverbs', 'said', 'little', 'prince', 'lost', 'aviator', 'companion', 'entertain']",Little Prince VHS

I read Le Petit Prince in french class this year, in French of course. I also read the English version of the book soon afterwards. Furthermore I have read much analysis of the philosophy presented in the book. Then in French class my teacher brought in this movie. Before we watched it she warned us that it was really weird. I did not really know what to expect, I mean the book was pretty weird, how could the movie be weird if the book was considered normal. After these thoughts came throug my head she told us that the people don't talk, but they sing. Whoa...Basically most everyone knows the plot I will just touch on it. The movie starts out with some weird singing about the hat that the narrator drew as a child and then goes into an overlong song about the narrator's need for air. So far this was rather weird I along with the rest of my class looked as if we were watching a fat man dance naked in the middle of the street. You know that look? Half sneer and half laugh. Well the movie continued to get weirder and I came to the conclusion that existentialist stories should never be turned into movies. However later it reached the pinnacle of its weirdness with the snake dance that lasted for much, much too long. Well at least we know where Michael Jackson got his gig.The movie featured much of the same dialogue as did the book, sometimes the conversion was word for word. However the movie did skip over many of the imprtant scenes that really did explain Saint-Euxpery's philosophy. Furthermore the Little Prince's naivite was betrayed by his request to go to Earth. One of the important scenes that was skipped over was the scene with the king telling the Little Prince about judging yourself and the scene with the vain man was equally important.Furthermore the Little Prince was obnoxiously cute, and although he was not a bad actor, in fact he was a really good actor for a child his age, we could have easily gone without him opening his mouth to sing on a couple songs.In conclusion the movie was much too weird for my tastes and did change some of the things that made the book a great book.
