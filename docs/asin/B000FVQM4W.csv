Taken each by their protectors, Karsh and Illeana to their safety to the next dimension, during in the peak of the war between Coventry and the Darkness, after it had taken the life of their father, Aron who had given them his every drop of powers to each of them.Separated, each of them lead their own life, with lifestyles pretty much contrasted to each other. Camryn got adopted by David and Emily Barnes, pretty much rich folks who could afford anything for their beloved Cammy, as prove she got a car for her 16th birthday! Alex however lived her life in a lowside, living with her best friend since her mother died 2 month prior, looking for work on the side.Karsh and Illieana stayed by them as they were growing up waiting for the time when they thought the twins are finally ready to take a hold of their destiny and they chose the day when they finally turned 21. Karsh intruded so Alex got to bump onto her long lost sister in a store. The rest of the day became a day of revelations for them. They realized in their whole life they had never parted with their past and their true home. Alex wrote stories of Coventry ever since she was a kid and active during the night and Cam drew sketches of her homeland and characters that turned out to be the Darkness and their mother. Time was running short and they needed to find a way to defeat the Darkness and meet with their long lost mother who was looking for them all of their lives, who remarried to Thantos, brother to their father.The advert itself for the Disney Channel tempted me to watch it and the wait actually paid off! The beginning was quite baffling at first but I soon caught up with the storyline. The plot is cute in some points and nerve testing in a few but of course there's a bit of that special Disney touch of tear jerking moments. The special effects and sets are amazing and beautiful. I am in love with the Merlin-ish touch they have managed to add in and it fits lovely!Tia and Tamera Mowry really filled up the gaps for their fans who miss them while they are away from the tv show business and I'm glad they are included in this one. I really enjoy watching this movie and I hope other people would make be willing to add this into their DVD listing as I would.",5,Magical 21st Birthday,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,2459,"['original', 'Disney', 'Movie', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'starring', 'one', 'famous', 'twins', 'Tia', 'Tamera', 'Mowry', 'Alex', 'Fielding', 'Camryn', 'Barnes', 'who', 'was', 'separated', 'birth', 'Taken', 'protectors', 'Karsh', 'Illeana', 'safety', 'next', 'dimension', 'peak', 'war', 'Coventry', 'Darkness', 'had', 'taken', 'life', 'father', 'Aron', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'drop', 'powers', 'them.Separated', 'lead', 'own', 'life', 'lifestyles', 'pretty', 'much', 'contrasted', 'other', 'Camryn', 'got', 'adopted', 'David', 'Emily', 'Barnes', 'pretty', 'much', 'rich', 'folks', 'who', 'could', 'afford', 'anything', 'beloved', 'Cammy', 'prove', 'got', 'car', '16th', 'birthday', 'Alex', 'however', 'lived', 'life', 'lowside', 'living', 'best', 'friend', 'mother', 'died', '2', 'month', 'prior', 'looking', 'work', 'side.Karsh', 'Illieana', 'stayed', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'waiting', 'time', 'when', 'thought', 'twins', 'are', 'finally', 'ready', 'take', 'hold', 'destiny', 'chose', 'day', 'when', 'finally', 'turned', '21', 'Karsh', 'intruded', 'so', 'Alex', 'got', 'bump', 'long', 'lost', 'sister', 'store', 'rest', 'day', 'became', 'day', 'revelations', 'realized', 'whole', 'life', 'had', 'never', 'parted', 'past', 'true', 'home', 'Alex', 'wrote', 'stories', 'Coventry', 'ever', 'was', 'kid', 'active', 'night', 'Cam', 'drew', 'sketches', 'homeland', 'characters', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Darkness', 'mother', 'Time', 'was', 'running', 'short', 'needed', 'find', 'way', 'defeat', 'Darkness', 'meet', 'long', 'lost', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'lives', 'who', 'remarried', 'Thantos', 'brother', 'father.The', 'advert', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'tempted', 'watch', 'wait', 'actually', 'paid', 'off', 'beginning', 'was', 'quite', 'baffling', 'first', 'soon', 'caught', 'up', 'storyline', 'plot', 'cute', 'points', 'nerve', 'testing', 'few', 'course', 'bit', 'special', 'Disney', 'touch', 'tear', 'jerking', 'moments', 'special', 'effects', 'sets', 'are', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'am', 'love', 'Merlin-ish', 'touch', 'have', 'managed', 'add', 'lovely', 'Tia', 'Tamera', 'Mowry', 'really', 'filled', 'up', 'gaps', 'fans', 'who', 'miss', 'are', 'away', 'tv', 'show', 'business', ""'m"", 'glad', 'are', 'included', 'one', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'hope', 'other', 'people', 'would', 'make', 'be', 'willing', 'add', 'DVD', 'listing', 'would']",Twitches
