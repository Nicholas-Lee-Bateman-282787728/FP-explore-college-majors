By now, she's met and thanked Dean Stockwell (Al) for his character's shenanigans and how he helped Sam out every week.MY RECOMMENDATIONIf you like stories about angels, not knowing they're angels, helping others ...If you like shows about time travel ...If you like shows that include scientific mumbo-jumbo ...you'll love this show.Sam's experiment to move in time works, but, at the same time, goes awry,Sam finds himself inside a person's body, and everyone else sees him as that person, but we see him as Sam, which can be hilarious at times when he becomes a person with no legs, or becomes a frenzied mother.He must figure out why he is there, with Al's help,  then solve that problem before he can leave, hoping to go back home.Sometimes, we see the anti-Sam character, who tries to mess everything up.Sam becomes convinced that God is controlling his jumps, using him to make right what has gone wrong. And yes, eventually, Sam meets God, but I won't give away more than that.Quantum Leap is a wonderful show. I'm glad to finally own all five seasons. I've even read a few of the books.",5,"I have no problem giving this five stars, Wish I could give it ten.",1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1187,"['mother', 'back', 'when', 'was', '80', 'loved', 'show', 'hope', 'still', 'now', 'met', 'thanked', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Al', 'character', 'shenanigans', 'how', 'helped', 'Sam', 'out', 'week.MY', 'RECOMMENDATIONIf', 'stories', 'angels', 'not', 'knowing', ""'re"", 'angels', 'helping', 'others', 'like', 'shows', 'time', 'travel', 'like', 'shows', 'include', 'scientific', 'mumbo-jumbo', ""'ll"", 'love', 'show.Sam', 'experiment', 'move', 'time', 'works', 'same', 'time', 'awry', 'Sam', 'person', 'body', 'everyone', 'else', 'person', 'see', 'Sam', 'can', 'be', 'hilarious', 'times', 'when', 'person', 'legs', 'frenzied', 'mother.He', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'there', 'Al', 'help', 'then', 'solve', 'problem', 'can', 'leave', 'hoping', 'go', 'back', 'home.Sometimes', 'see', 'anti-Sam', 'character', 'who', 'mess', 'everything', 'up.Sam', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'God', 'controlling', 'jumps', 'using', 'make', 'right', 'gone', 'wrong', 'yes', 'eventually', 'Sam', 'God', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'that.Quantum', 'Leap', 'wonderful', 'show', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'own', 'five', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'even', 'read', 'few', 'books']",N/A

The chemistry between these two amazing actors is pure enjoyment to watch. My ONLY complaint was the way the writers wrapped up the series. I was greatly disappointed in the final episode and felt it really paled in comparison to the rest of the series episodes. It truly seemed like the writer's had lost interest in delivering a quality story and did not care how they left the fans feeling. I highly recommend this series for many hours of fine family entertainment.",5,Awesome FAMILY entertainment!!!

If you already own these, there is no need to buy this.If you don't own any of the sets, you are better off buying them individually and save yourself some $$$. I've seen these sets at B&M; Walmart and Target for $10-$12 a season. You can pick them up on Amazon in the $10-$20 range. Why spend nearly $140 bucks for this bundle when you can get the same thing piece meal for $50-$100?I really wish Universal took the care to release an actual box set and not just a bundle of  the old sets.
