451583,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,6305154996,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[27, 28]","It has been said many times that music is the universal language.  While the truth of this statement is self-evident, occasionally even universal languages require translators.  For that, great men such as Leonard Bernstein have stepped to the fore to assist the rest of us in understanding what is perhaps man's single greatest art form.This is a magnificent documentary of the life of this incredible individual.  Leonard Bernstein can be called the Carl Sagan of classical music.  What the Cornell astronomer did to popularize science to a wide audience, so too did the conductor do the same for classical music.  The present DVD traces the remarkable career of Bernstein from his early flirtations with fame up through to his death in 1990.The footage contains commentary by his daughters, son, friends and fellow conductors and musicians.  Some of the notable names to compile the latter groups are Michael Tilson Thomas, Seiji Ozawa, Isaac Stern and Andre Previn.  All angles of his life are covered, from his professional life to his personal life to his struggles with his bi-sexuality.The shortcomings of this DVD are few, but I am compelled to point them out.  For one, it is only hinted at a few times just how diverse Bernstein's taste in music was.  Not everyone knows this, but he was a huge fan of both the BEATLES and PINK FLOYD.  Some anecdotes from the likes of people such as David Gilmour and Paul McCartney would have complemented this DVD nicely.  Both knew Lenny and were friends of his.Also, it would have been nice to have learned more about his childhood.  They pretty much skimmed over that, for the most part.  The ""story"" portrayed almost begins where he sub-conducted for Bruno Walter, getting his big break.That said, this is a must-buy for all fans of music, all fans of Leonard Bernstein, and all fans of the human race.  Paul Hindemuth once said ""Those who make music together cannot be enemies.  So long as the music lasts.""  Hence, nobody could ever be a true enemy of the great Leonard Bernstein, for he made music with the entire world.",5,Absolute BERNSTEIN!,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,2074,"['been', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'music', 'universal', 'language', 'truth', 'statement', 'self-evident', 'occasionally', 'even', 'universal', 'languages', 'require', 'translators', 'great', 'men', 'such', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'have', 'stepped', 'fore', 'assist', 'rest', 'understanding', 'what', 'perhaps', 'man', 'single', 'greatest', 'art', 'form.This', 'magnificent', 'documentary', 'life', 'incredible', 'individual', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'classical', 'music', 'What', 'Cornell', 'astronomer', 'did', 'popularize', 'science', 'wide', 'audience', 'so', 'too', 'did', 'conductor', 'do', 'same', 'classical', 'music', 'present', 'DVD', 'remarkable', 'career', 'Bernstein', 'early', 'flirtations', 'fame', 'up', 'death', '1990.The', 'footage', 'contains', 'commentary', 'daughters', 'son', 'friends', 'fellow', 'conductors', 'musicians', 'notable', 'names', 'compile', 'latter', 'groups', 'are', 'Michael', 'Tilson', 'Thomas', 'Seiji', 'Ozawa', 'Isaac', 'Stern', 'Andre', 'Previn', 'angles', 'life', 'are', 'covered', 'professional', 'life', 'personal', 'life', 'struggles', 'bi-sexuality.The', 'shortcomings', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'am', 'compelled', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'only', 'hinted', 'few', 'times', 'just', 'how', 'diverse', 'Bernstein', 'taste', 'music', 'was', 'Not', 'everyone', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'BEATLES', 'PINK', 'FLOYD', 'anecdotes', 'likes', 'people', 'such', 'David', 'Gilmour', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'would', 'have', 'complemented', 'DVD', 'nicely', 'knew', 'Lenny', 'were', 'friends', 'his.Also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'learned', 'more', 'childhood', 'pretty', 'much', 'skimmed', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'where', 'sub-conducted', 'Bruno', 'Walter', 'getting', 'big', 'break.That', 'said', 'must-buy', 'fans', 'music', 'fans', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'fans', 'human', 'race', 'Paul', 'Hindemuth', 'once', 'said', 'who', 'make', 'music', 'together', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'enemies', 'So', 'long', 'music', 'Hence', 'nobody', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'true', 'enemy', 'great', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'made', 'music', 'entire', 'world']",Leonard Bernstein - Reaching for the Note
451584,ABDHAYPNM28US,6305154996,Jason,"[17, 26]","&quot;They don't make 'em like they used to.&quot; This phrase can certainly apply to Leonard Bernstein: conductor, composer, teacher, humanitarian, and complex individual. Bernstein worked hard to knock classical music and opera from their pedestals and make those genres accessible to ordinary people, while according popular music and jazz the same respect as classical and opera. Whether it was his charisma, sense of humor, good looks, &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; attitude, or a combination of all these elements, Bernstein still has no peer in attempting this feat. Maybe it's just not &quot;lucrative enough&quot; in our corporate-oriented, essentially conservative, times.Accompanied by interviews with friends, collaborators, and his children, &quot;Reaching for the Note&quot; provides a compelling portrait of Bernstein. This could have been a conventional documentary, but it instead captures a flavor for Bernstein's life. Rather than just covering &quot;major events,&quot; this documentary also explores the struggles of being Leonard Bernstein. Beginning with footage from his funeral cortege (accompanied by the second movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony), this documentary contains many unforgettable and moving moments, such as Bernstein's chiding of the Vienna Philharmonic for giving an indifferent rehearsal of Mahler (&quot;I don't care about your 'eight hours.'&quot;); building morale for Israel in the Six Days' War by performing Mahler's &quot;Resurrection&quot; symphony (which, in view of the atrocities committed by Israelis against Palestinians, may begin to seem as politically incorrect as Wagner's anti-Semitism); and the montage of home movie footage from the Bernstein family's &quot;golden years,&quot; which seems even more poignant when one realizes how it collapsed under the weight of Bernstein's personal struggles in his later years. Most striking are the ambiguities of the man: a conductor who also wanted to be remembered as a composer; a humanitarian who could become temperamental; a family man who struggled with his bisexuality. Was it indecision, or simply a desire to live life to its fullest in the material and spiritual realms?Whatever one may think of the man, Bernstein's legacy has made him a musical titan. And until someone else as well-read, charismatic, godlike, and human comes along in conducting, Bernstein is guaranteed a top spot alongside such legends as Herbert von Karajan and Sir Georg Solti.One decade after his death, Lenny is still sorely missed. Who knows what else he could have done had he smoked a few less cigarettes, downed a few less bottles of scotch, and had been productive into his early eighties? He would have recorded Benjamin Britten's &quot;Peter Grimes,&quot; or written his planned symphony about the Holocaust. But Lenny is gone, and we won't see the likes of him again. But, as one person said, maybe Lenny's spirit is now in the body of a bright and talented ten-year-old. Perhaps s/he will compare the angst in Mahler's symphonies and the music of nine inch nails, or rail against the corporate oligarchy, mean-spiritedness, and political conservatism that's slowly devouring our country. One can only hope that Lenny will live again. If not, then he has left us with much to contemplate, both about music and ourselves.",5,Reaching for Lenny,979344000,"01 13, 2001",2001,3321,"['quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'used', 'to.', 'quot', 'phrase', 'can', 'certainly', 'apply', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'conductor', 'composer', 'teacher', 'humanitarian', 'complex', 'individual', 'Bernstein', 'worked', 'hard', 'knock', 'classical', 'music', 'opera', 'pedestals', 'make', 'genres', 'accessible', 'ordinary', 'people', 'according', 'popular', 'music', 'jazz', 'same', 'respect', 'classical', 'opera', 'was', 'charisma', 'sense', 'humor', 'good', 'looks', 'quot', 'Renaissance', 'Man', 'quot', 'attitude', 'combination', 'elements', 'Bernstein', 'still', 'peer', 'attempting', 'feat', 'just', 'not', 'quot', 'lucrative', 'enough', 'quot', 'corporate-oriented', 'essentially', 'conservative', 'times.Accompanied', 'interviews', 'friends', 'collaborators', 'children', 'quot', 'Reaching', 'Note', 'quot', 'compelling', 'portrait', 'Bernstein', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'conventional', 'documentary', 'instead', 'flavor', 'Bernstein', 'life', 'Rather', 'just', 'covering', 'quot', 'major', 'events', 'quot', 'documentary', 'also', 'struggles', 'being', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'Beginning', 'footage', 'funeral', 'cortege', 'accompanied', 'second', 'movement', 'Beethoven', 'Seventh', 'Symphony', 'documentary', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'moving', 'moments', 'such', 'Bernstein', 'chiding', 'Vienna', 'Philharmonic', 'giving', 'indifferent', 'rehearsal', 'Mahler', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'eight"", 'hours', 'quot', 'building', 'morale', 'Israel', 'Six', 'Days', 'War', 'performing', 'Mahler', 'quot', 'Resurrection', 'quot', 'symphony', 'view', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Israelis', 'Palestinians', 'may', 'begin', 'seem', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'Wagner', 'anti-Semitism', 'montage', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'Bernstein', 'family', 'quot', 'golden', 'years', 'quot', 'even', 'more', 'poignant', 'when', 'one', 'how', 'collapsed', 'weight', 'Bernstein', 'personal', 'struggles', 'later', 'years', 'Most', 'striking', 'are', 'ambiguities', 'man', 'conductor', 'who', 'also', 'wanted', 'be', 'remembered', 'composer', 'humanitarian', 'who', 'could', 'become', 'temperamental', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'struggled', 'bisexuality', 'Was', 'indecision', 'simply', 'desire', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'material', 'spiritual', 'realms', 'one', 'may', 'think', 'man', 'Bernstein', 'legacy', 'made', 'musical', 'titan', 'someone', 'else', 'well-read', 'charismatic', 'godlike', 'human', 'along', 'conducting', 'Bernstein', 'guaranteed', 'top', 'spot', 'such', 'legends', 'Herbert', 'von', 'Karajan', 'Sir', 'Georg', 'Solti.One', 'decade', 'death', 'Lenny', 'still', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Who', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'had', 'smoked', 'few', 'less', 'cigarettes', 'downed', 'few', 'less', 'bottles', 'scotch', 'had', 'been', 'productive', 'early', 'eighties', 'would', 'have', 'recorded', 'Benjamin', 'Britten', 'quot', 'Peter', 'Grimes', 'quot', 'written', 'planned', 'symphony', 'Holocaust', 'Lenny', 'gone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'likes', 'again', 'one', 'person', 'said', 'maybe', 'Lenny', 'spirit', 'now', 'body', 'bright', 'talented', 'ten-year-old', 'Perhaps', 's/he', 'will', 'compare', 'angst', 'Mahler', 'symphonies', 'music', 'nine', 'inch', 'nails', 'rail', 'corporate', 'oligarchy', 'mean-spiritedness', 'political', 'conservatism', 'slowly', 'devouring', 'country', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Lenny', 'will', 'live', 'again', 'not', 'then', 'left', 'much', 'contemplate', 'music']",Leonard Bernstein - Reaching for the Note

Thanks for that.I can think of no more compelling 20th c. musician. Everything about Reaching for the Note is about the living lamp that is Bernstein's work, about the music he became; always breathing life, whatever his job. The film spends generous time with West Side Story, with a remarkable stretch of essential comments by Sondheim, Carol Lawrence, &Arthur; Larents interspersing a cache of unbelievable rehearsal and performance footage. It's a master class in filmmaking, and we believe again how great a work West Side Story is. His symphonies, greater than the world knows, confirm the film's heart. In generous performance passages of the Kaddish Sym., the voice overs are subdued, as if in the live presence of the music. The film never wavers in its tenderness toward Bernstein, and the Idea he embodied.Best thing about this American Masters series perfect jewel, is hearing Bernstein's occasional remarks - to hear his voice again!. About his own intensity, he says ""What I enjoy, I want to share."" Enjoy this film treat!

Wisper ""Michael W""","[0, 0]","Running nearly 2 hours, this wonderful documentary chronicles in great detail the life of one of America's greatest composers and conductors. It starts, unlike most biopics, with his death, represented by a funeral profession through Manhattan which attracted tens of thousands of fans. The turn-out was one of the most remarkable sights ever seen in dedication to a native son who brought so much to the music world. It then flashes back to his most humble beginnings in the tenements of New York and traces an unbelievable rise to become the youngest American conductor ever of the New York Philharmonic. His love of music was spread to the country and the world through his televised explanatory concerts, most notably those directed at children whom Bernstein saw as the future of music...and he was correct, of course! He struggled with his personal demons, primarily concerning his homosexuality, but these never disrupted his body of compositions and his contributions mighty and many to the music world. This is a wonderful video, most comprehensive and a joy to watch. Bernstein's slife is handed to us through newsreels, interviews and snapshots from personal family collections.

His musical life was likewise pulled in several directions:  he wanted to be a conductor, composer, and a teacher.Remarkably, he succeeded rather well at everything he tried.  Like so many geniuses, he was both arrogant at times, and then at other times, insecure.  For all his exceptional abilities, he was a human being, troubled by trying to figure out just how he should fit into the world.If you love and appreciate Leonard Bernstein, you should find this a very good view of his life.
