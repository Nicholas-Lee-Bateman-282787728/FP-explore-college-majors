167161,A1CNNWWDBNUF0F,0945671075,"""amazonchicken""","[13, 13]","As a recent fan of the Living Yoga series, this tape has it's own unique edge. I have already tried Living Yoga's Lower Body for beginners, also with Suzanne Deason, and she's a yoga teacher I've come to really appreciate. She doesn't bombard the viewer with information, and she manages to gently guide you through a 20 minute yoga workout that really melts the stress away.Filmed in Maui (most Living Yoga tapes are, the scenery of these tapes is always breathtaking), the gentle waves and gorgeous sunset in the background have a fantasic calming effect on the viewer. Of course the workout itself is well worth all five stars, it is worth mentionning that the scenery has a kind of subconscious meditative effect that really mellows you out.She starts off with a 4 minute gentle stretch, which, although some people may find too fast and hard to keep up with, I had absolutely no problems keeping up. Besides, it's only 4 minutes and it's mostly arm movements while in mountain pose, so it's basically something the average person can easily keep up with. By the second or third try it shouldn't even be a problem.Next is a 13 minute stress relief workout which, in my opinion, is not only a massive understatement, but seems to fly by in much less than 13 minutes. It requires the use of a block and a yoga strap (I use books and my old karate belt), and it's really very easy. The point of these exercises is NOT to add stress onto your body (she thouroughly explains all this in the beginning of the tape), but to just gently stretch and do what you can. If you've ever seen any of Suzanne Deason's other workouts, it's VERY clear that in this particular tape she's not working at maximum capacity; which essentially is the point. Who wants to work up a sweat and stretch all kinds of muscles to the max when you're stressed out anyway?Finally, she finishes off with a 3 minute deep relaxation, which, by the end of it, you've pretty well forgotten what stressed you out so much in the first place. All in all, the whole reason I bought the tape to begin with. It works; I'm happy.This tape is also really good for beginners, because the main focus is not on pushing yourself to the limits, but rather just going through the motions without placing any additional stress onto your body. If you aren't the lest bit flexible, and you want to get into yoga for some quiet time or maybe because you're just having 'one of those days' and you want a healthy alternative to heading to the pub for a few drinks, this is a great option. Some people may not find this tape challenging, but I suspect that would be the point to stress relief. It's not challenging, and when I'm stressed out, or something is bothering me, I don't care to take on an additional challenge, I just want to release tension. If you're anything like me in that respect, then this tape is a great investment!",5,"Very simple, effective and to the point!",994636800,"07 9, 2001",2001,2881,"['recent', 'fan', 'Living', 'Yoga', 'series', 'tape', 'own', 'unique', 'edge', 'have', 'already', 'tried', 'Living', 'Yoga', 'Lower', 'Body', 'beginners', 'also', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'yoga', 'teacher', ""'ve"", 'come', 'really', 'appreciate', ""n't"", 'bombard', 'viewer', 'information', 'gently', 'guide', '20', 'minute', 'yoga', 'really', 'stress', 'away.Filmed', 'Maui', 'most', 'Living', 'Yoga', 'tapes', 'are', 'scenery', 'tapes', 'always', 'breathtaking', 'gentle', 'waves', 'gorgeous', 'sunset', 'background', 'have', 'fantasic', 'calming', 'effect', 'viewer', 'course', 'workout', 'well', 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'worth', 'mentionning', 'scenery', 'kind', 'subconscious', 'meditative', 'effect', 'really', 'out.She', '4', 'minute', 'gentle', 'stretch', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'fast', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'had', 'absolutely', 'problems', 'keeping', 'up', 'only', '4', 'minutes', 'mostly', 'arm', 'movements', 'mountain', 'pose', 'basically', 'something', 'average', 'person', 'can', 'easily', 'keep', 'up', 'second', 'third', 'try', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'problem.Next', '13', 'minute', 'stress', 'relief', 'workout', 'opinion', 'not', 'only', 'massive', 'understatement', 'fly', 'much', 'less', '13', 'minutes', 'use', 'block', 'yoga', 'strap', 'use', 'books', 'old', 'karate', 'belt', 'really', 'very', 'easy', 'point', 'exercises', 'NOT', 'add', 'stress', 'body', 'thouroughly', 'beginning', 'tape', 'just', 'gently', 'stretch', 'do', 'what', 'can', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'other', 'workouts', 'VERY', 'clear', 'particular', 'tape', 'not', 'working', 'maximum', 'capacity', 'essentially', 'point', 'Who', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'stretch', 'kinds', 'muscles', 'max', 'when', ""'re"", 'stressed', 'out', 'anyway', 'Finally', '3', 'minute', 'deep', 'relaxation', 'end', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'well', 'forgotten', 'what', 'stressed', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'place', 'whole', 'reason', 'bought', 'tape', 'begin', ""'m"", 'happy.This', 'tape', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'beginners', 'main', 'focus', 'not', 'pushing', 'limits', 'rather', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'placing', 'additional', 'stress', 'body', 'are', ""n't"", 'lest', 'bit', 'flexible', 'want', 'get', 'yoga', 'quiet', 'time', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'just', 'having', ""'one"", 'days', 'want', 'healthy', 'alternative', 'heading', 'pub', 'few', 'drinks', 'great', 'option', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'tape', 'challenging', 'suspect', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'stress', 'relief', 'not', 'challenging', 'when', ""'m"", 'stressed', 'out', 'something', 'bothering', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'take', 'additional', 'challenge', 'just', 'want', 'release', 'tension', ""'re"", 'anything', 'respect', 'then', 'tape', 'great', 'investment']",N/A

While I have been practicing in the privacy of my home, I have stepped into a studio at my gym only one other time. The effect was a crowded room, fast movements, a lot of assumption that I knew the moves by their names, and too much time spent looking over my shoulder or through my legs to figure out what I should be doing. I do have one other video and it has been fine for me thus far (Yoga for Dummies). But this video is pleasant, soothing and relaxing. It is short enough (20 minutes) and simple enough for me to feel as though I am making progress (so to speak). I have even surprised myself by practicing with this video twice a day: I practice early in the morning before work--a stressful place, and in the evening before going to bed. I recognized, after the first time practicing with this video, that I have been extremely tight. Therefore, it is no surprise that I have been stressed out. Do I feel De-stressed?

167165,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,0945671075,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[9, 9]","I got this tape because I was looking for a shorter yoga workout to perform during times when I'm time-crunched (most yoga tapes seem to be 40-60 minutes); I also wanted something that was gentle and relaxing as opposed to a more &quot;power yoga&quot; style.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this video, which feels rushed rather than relaxing.  Although instructor Suzanne Deason's voice is soothing and she cues well, she moves so quickly from pose to pose that there's little opportunity to enjoy the positions.  Furthermore, the use of props only hinders and further complicates this practice--if the workout moved at a slower pace, the props would be a nice addition, allowing those with less flexibility to attain the poses, but because the transitions are so fast, I spent most of my time worrying about where the props were supposed to be positioned, leaving little time to relax in the poses.  If you are looking for a short, relaxing yoga practice, I would recommend instead Patricia Walden's PM Yoga; or, if you have more time, Suzanne Deason does a much better job in her Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss.",2,"A short practice, but moves too fast to be relaxing.",1037059200,"11 12, 2002",2002,1129,"['got', 'tape', 'was', 'looking', 'shorter', 'yoga', 'workout', 'perform', 'times', 'when', ""'m"", 'time-crunched', 'most', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'seem', 'be', '40-60', 'minutes', 'also', 'wanted', 'something', 'was', 'gentle', 'relaxing', 'as', 'opposed', 'more', 'quot', 'power', 'yoga', 'quot', 'style', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'video', 'rushed', 'rather', 'relaxing', 'instructor', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'voice', 'soothing', 'well', 'so', 'quickly', 'pose', 'pose', 'little', 'opportunity', 'enjoy', 'positions', 'Furthermore', 'use', 'props', 'only', 'hinders', 'further', 'complicates', 'practice', 'workout', 'moved', 'slower', 'pace', 'props', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'addition', 'allowing', 'less', 'flexibility', 'attain', 'poses', 'transitions', 'are', 'so', 'fast', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'worrying', 'where', 'props', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'positioned', 'leaving', 'little', 'time', 'relax', 'poses', 'are', 'looking', 'short', 'relaxing', 'yoga', 'practice', 'would', 'recommend', 'instead', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'PM', 'Yoga', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'Yoga', 'Conditioning', 'Weight', 'Loss']",N/A
167166,A17TDSX354MP7Y,0945671075,CPTScott,"[20, 20]","This is actually my second review of this video. I wrote the first after having it for a short time and I loved it then!I love it even more now!I do yoga every day at home and take a class with a great teacher also (and have over 50 Yoga videos). Most of the time I'm inclined towards a more rigorous vinyasa flow style yoga but I find I can't do that sort of practice everyday.This is a tape I use a lot for those ""in between"" days when I want to do some yoga but don't want to push too hard. For me it's a somewhat restorative tape (though not in the ""strict"" sense of the word as described in most yoga books/videos).What I love about this tape is that it moves you through your full range of movements, from gentle forward bends, side bends, shoulder openers, twists and back bends so that you open up your whole body.The poses aren't held for a long time because the purpose of this tape isn't to move you deeply into postures. Instead it is to gently awaken and remove the ""kinks"" and muscular tensions from your body.I find this tape is so gentle that I can use it even if I am a bit under the weather but still want to do something to help me feel balanced and remove body aches without pushing me too hard.As far as the pacing goes, I can see that the first time or two (especially if you are new to yoga) it may seem hard to follow, but I don't find it difficult to breathe thru this tape at all. Once you know the routine I think the overall pacing isn't a problem at all and in fact is quite relaxing.Also, you can use this tape as a slightly more challenging short practice by doing slightly more difficult versions of the poses. For example, doing a full Eagle pose (standing on one leg with one leg over the other),Triangle or Side Angle poses (or any of the poses for that matter) without a block, or in the kneeling prayer twist, keep your back leg off the ground in a full lunge position to get a lunging prayer twist. This increases the challenge quite a bit.Regarding the need for props for this tape. I would recommend buying at least a strap and a block (Yoga Zone has really nice thick blocks which give a lot of stability). If you do yoga fairly regularly the cost of those items is really negligible. Still, you can use a tie or belt from a bathrobe for a strap and I guess books or something like that for a block, but the blocks are much easier to manipulate and the synthetic foam blocks tend to be gentle on the hands and have better traction (which is much safer).I hope this review is helpful:)Namaste",5,A Full Range of Gentle Movements To Awaken Your Body,1049760000,"04 8, 2003",2003,2532,"['actually', 'second', 'review', 'video', 'wrote', 'first', 'having', 'short', 'time', 'loved', 'then', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'do', 'yoga', 'day', 'home', 'take', 'class', 'great', 'teacher', 'also', 'have', 'over', '50', 'Yoga', 'videos', 'Most', 'time', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'more', 'rigorous', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'style', 'yoga', 'find', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'sort', 'practice', 'everyday.This', 'tape', 'use', 'lot', 'days', 'when', 'want', 'do', 'yoga', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'push', 'too', 'hard', 'somewhat', 'restorative', 'tape', 'not', 'strict', 'sense', 'word', 'described', 'most', 'yoga', 'books/videos', '.What', 'love', 'tape', 'full', 'range', 'movements', 'gentle', 'forward', 'bends', 'side', 'bends', 'shoulder', 'openers', 'twists', 'back', 'bends', 'open', 'up', 'whole', 'body.The', 'poses', 'are', ""n't"", 'held', 'long', 'time', 'purpose', 'tape', ""n't"", 'move', 'deeply', 'postures', 'Instead', 'gently', 'awaken', 'remove', 'kinks', 'muscular', 'tensions', 'body.I', 'find', 'tape', 'so', 'gentle', 'can', 'use', 'even', 'am', 'bit', 'weather', 'still', 'want', 'do', 'something', 'help', 'feel', 'balanced', 'remove', 'body', 'aches', 'pushing', 'too', 'hard.As', 'far', 'pacing', 'can', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'two', 'especially', 'are', 'new', 'yoga', 'may', 'seem', 'hard', 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'difficult', 'breathe', 'thru', 'tape', 'know', 'routine', 'think', 'overall', 'pacing', ""n't"", 'problem', 'fact', 'quite', 'relaxing.Also', 'can', 'use', 'tape', 'slightly', 'more', 'challenging', 'short', 'practice', 'doing', 'slightly', 'more', 'difficult', 'versions', 'poses', 'example', 'doing', 'full', 'Eagle', 'pose', 'standing', 'one', 'leg', 'one', 'leg', 'other', 'Triangle', 'Side', 'Angle', 'poses', 'matter', 'block', 'kneeling', 'prayer', 'twist', 'keep', 'back', 'leg', 'ground', 'full', 'lunge', 'position', 'get', 'lunging', 'prayer', 'twist', 'challenge', 'quite', 'bit.Regarding', 'need', 'props', 'tape', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'least', 'strap', 'block', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'really', 'nice', 'thick', 'blocks', 'give', 'lot', 'stability', 'do', 'yoga', 'fairly', 'regularly', 'cost', 'items', 'really', 'negligible', 'Still', 'can', 'use', 'tie', 'belt', 'bathrobe', 'strap', 'guess', 'books', 'something', 'block', 'blocks', 'are', 'much', 'easier', 'manipulate', 'synthetic', 'foam', 'blocks', 'tend', 'be', 'gentle', 'hands', 'have', 'better', 'traction', 'much', 'safer', 'hope', 'review', 'helpful', 'Namaste']",N/A
