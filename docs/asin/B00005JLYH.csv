609370,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,B00005JLYH,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[2, 2]","I like to compare movies and characters from similar genres. Victor Rosa is a tough hood who in the end plays out a losing hand. While Rosa is less ruthless than Nino Brown (New Jack City) and smarter than Tony Montana (Scarface) in not using his own supply of drugs, he is still not as savvy as Carlito (Carlito's Way, Carlito: Rise To Power). Carlito would never have been taken the way Victor Rosa was, and would have had connections to deal with anyone foolish enough to have dared to screw him over--no matter where the hapless fool flew to.I loved the setting of the movie. Indeed, when I viewed it and saw the Twin Towers from a Manhattan park I had to look at Leonard Maltin's Movie Review to see when the movie was made. It looks so contemorary that I was surprised to find t had been made 10 years ago. It still looks fresh and contemporary to me.While Leonard Maltin gave this movie only Two Stars, it is at least a Three And A Half Star Movie and I rounded it up to Four Stars as there is no 3.5 Star Rating. I loved Reyes' take on South Bronx. He is a remarkable up and coming writer and director. The sky is the limit for him.I won't go into all the details of the plot but I will laud the supporting cast. Peter Saarsgaard and Denise Richards and ohh my goodness--Cotto! Wow! They are great in this movie and that does not mention Sonia Braga and Treach and Fat Joe.

609371,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLYH,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I had high expectation for `Empire'.  That is probably where I went wrong.  As far as a drug fueled gangster story, this does have its high points, but overall it misses a lot of marks and comes up short too many times for me.  It wants to be something more than it is capable of becoming.  I take that back.  It wants to be something more than it actually is, which is sad because it was capable of becoming all that it wanted to be.Make sense?The film tells the story of hustler Victor Rosa who makes a decent living being fairly indecent.  In an attempt to solidify his safety (and procure a nice future), Victor tries his hand at more complex games only to eventually be taken for everything.Not good.With a cast that includes some pretty heavy hitters (Sarsgaard, Rossellini), some beautiful faces (Braga, Richards) and some charismatic talent (Leguizamo), this really should have been a slam dunk.  Sadly, it fails on two opposite ends of the spectrum.  As far as becoming an intelligent drama, the script lacks any real depth or polish.  It feels rushed and unfocused.  As far as being truly engaging and exciting, it suffers again from lack of real focus.  The film doesn't really have any true intensity, and thus it loses its bite and in the end loses the audience.The actors (outside of Leguizamo) aren't given much to build off of, which is a shame considering the talent involved.  Rossellini's role is rather thankless (UGH, she is so amazing, why couldn't they have really USED her?!?!?!) and Richards and Braga are given barely anything to do other than look pretty.  Richards nails her seductive nature, but she fades into shallow forgetfulness as the script disregards her.  Sarsgaard actually handles his character impeccably (he is good at the shady guy) but I would have loved to know more about his character.Yes, Leguizamo carries this movie, and actually does a stand-up job with what he is given.  I just wish that he had been given a better movie to work within.In the end, there are some themes that resonate well, they just aren't fleshed out enough.  I actually found the ending effectively chilling, I just wish that it also didn't come as such a relief for me (as in, thank god this is finally over).  I'm giving this a C.  It has something going for it, it just doesn't understand fully how to make that something WORK for it.I hate that this should have been so much better.",3,"The bigger the empire, the harder the fall...",1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,2407,"['had', 'high', 'expectation', 'Empire', 'probably', 'where', 'went', 'wrong', 'As', 'far', 'drug', 'fueled', 'gangster', 'story', 'have', 'high', 'points', 'overall', 'lot', 'marks', 'up', 'short', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'capable', 'becoming', 'take', 'back', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'actually', 'sad', 'was', 'capable', 'becoming', 'wanted', 'be.Make', 'sense', 'film', 'story', 'hustler', 'Victor', 'Rosa', 'who', 'decent', 'living', 'being', 'fairly', 'indecent', 'attempt', 'solidify', 'safety', 'procure', 'nice', 'future', 'Victor', 'hand', 'more', 'complex', 'games', 'only', 'eventually', 'be', 'taken', 'everything.Not', 'good.With', 'cast', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'hitters', 'Sarsgaard', 'Rossellini', 'beautiful', 'Braga', 'Richards', 'charismatic', 'talent', 'Leguizamo', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'slam', 'dunk', 'Sadly', 'two', 'opposite', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'As', 'far', 'becoming', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'script', 'real', 'depth', 'polish', 'rushed', 'unfocused', 'As', 'far', 'being', 'truly', 'engaging', 'exciting', 'again', 'lack', 'real', 'focus', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'true', 'intensity', 'thus', 'bite', 'end', 'audience.The', 'actors', 'Leguizamo', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'build', 'shame', 'considering', 'talent', 'involved', 'Rossellini', 'role', 'rather', 'thankless', 'UGH', 'so', 'amazing', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'really', 'USED', 'Richards', 'Braga', 'are', 'given', 'barely', 'anything', 'do', 'other', 'look', 'pretty', 'Richards', 'seductive', 'nature', 'shallow', 'forgetfulness', 'script', 'Sarsgaard', 'actually', 'character', 'impeccably', 'good', 'shady', 'guy', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'know', 'more', 'character.Yes', 'Leguizamo', 'movie', 'actually', 'stand-up', 'job', 'what', 'given', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'better', 'movie', 'work', 'end', 'are', 'themes', 'resonate', 'well', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'actually', 'found', 'ending', 'effectively', 'chilling', 'just', 'wish', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'such', 'relief', 'thank', 'god', 'finally', ""'m"", 'giving', 'C.', 'something', 'going', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'fully', 'how', 'make', 'something', 'WORK', 'it.I', 'hate', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Empire
609372,A2AFBVM5O9R09V,B00005JLYH,"Arish ""A+""","[0, 0]","I really have to say that I have really enjoyed this film! It had a plot to it, which most ganster films fell to give. I thought the whole idea of colliding the two worlds together was brillant! We never really get to see how the clean Business man is envolved with the Ghetto Drug Business. Which is true and this is happening everyday but we don't know about it. I thought John L, really did his part in the film and was convincing! I loved Deniese Richards part in the film. By the way Deniese has lost a lot of weight, shes looking alittle stressed out and older! The first time I noticed was in ""2000's Valentine"" and she has been incredibly skinny every since. But anyway over all this is a very suspenseful thriller it keeps you on the edge. It is like the ""New Jack City"" of the New Millenium! It really goes deep into the drug world and lets you see the reality of it. All the way down to how it is cut and how the ""Spots and Turfs"" are divided. After watching this film if you are Naive on this subject this will definitely teach you a whole lot! I will say that the ending was a bit short. I felt the confrontation between the Banker and John should have been more serious! I mean you are waiting on him to get this man back and it is over so expeditiously! I like man, it could have been a bit more suspenseful. But anyway overall it is the closest to a satifying ganster film as you are going to get. Goodness know's it makes more sense and runs a ring around ""Belly"" & ""Exit wounds"". I was really beginning to loose faith in black cinema.

She's the reason we root for the main character Victor, who is played perfectly by John Leguizamo. Leguizamo and Cotto had great on scene chemistry and that was a key element to the movie. Jack, who is played by Peter Saarsgard, pitches an investment opportunity to Victor and he goes with it. But Victor's life comes crashing down as his crew turns on him and his relationship with Carmen is skating on thin ice. Carmen's friend and Jack's girlfriend Trish, who is played by Denise Richards, turns out to not be such a good friend. You'll see how evil those two are as the movie goes on. The two characters that did great in supporting roles were Jimmy (Vincent Laresca) and Chedda (Treach).

Thankfully I didnt run to the theater to see it.Anyone who has seen ""Carlito's Way"" will remember John for his great protrayal of ""Benny Blanco From The Bronx"". In many ways this movie parrallels Carlito's Way and tries to be a 2002 version of that now classic movie. It's been a while since a really good crime drama came out - one that could take a place with Goodfellas, Scarface, Carltio's Way or Casino. This movie falls very short of being anything close to a return to the 80's and early 90's and the great crime dramas and gangster flicks from that period.The movie is about a latino man named Vic, who runs a drug cartel in south bronx. The product is called ""empire"", hence the name of the movie. The movie also has Leguizamo narrating, much in the way ""Carlito's Way"" did - only not very good. Where as 'Calito Brigante"" really did apear an intelligent, quick witted, and admirable character, ""Vic"" comes off much less apealing and the monologue isn't anything close. You wont hear any good lines in this one - nothing like ""the street is watching"".It's not an entirely bad movie either though. Just seeing Leguizamo on screen is entertaining because of his personality but he cant carry the whole movie and no other characters in the movie where even a slight bit interesting nor were they developed well in the plot. The ""twist"" at the end was anything BUT original too and the plot itself offers little to ponder.In the end this is a generic movie trying to be a new version of the great classic gangster flicks. It fails badly, but isnt a total snore either.

The area is split up into four sections with Victor's Empire being the largest. Victor has a great life -plenty of money and much respect from the people in his neighborhood. One day, through his girlfriend, he meets a rich business man, Jack, from downtown who convinces Victor to start investing with him. Soon more and more money starts rolling in and Victor starts the ""good life,"" which consists of living in huge apartment in SoHo, having ""better"" friends and contacts, and having even more money than he ever dreamed of back in the Bronx. Soon things start going wrong and it's up to Victor to fix everything.John Leguizamo, Treach, Fat Joe, and Delilah Cotto give excellent performances in this film. This film is obviously like many of the other mobster/mafia films in which there is a gangster who's trying to go legit, but this one has a latin flavor to it that makes it interesting and different.

John Leguizamo gives a solid performance as Victor, a good looking, exceptionally powerful drug kingpin from the South Bronx who, after he meets a shrewd white Wall Street yuppie named Jack, tries to channel his moneymaking skills into a more ""legitimate"" direction.  But Victor soon discovers that not only is it difficult for a person to leave his past behind him, but that even he isn't prepared for the venality and corruption he finds in the high stakes world of corporate greed.With Victor providing reflective voiceover narration to accompany the action, the film feels a bit like a mini-""Goodfellas"" in style and tone.  The story is not without interest, but, unfortunately, the farther it gets away from its South Bronx setting, the less believable and more melodramatic it becomes.  The early sections of the film, in which we see Victor operating his ""enterprise,"" are by far the best.  Writer/director Frank Reyes obviously knows whereof he films and he brings a chilling realism and sense of immediacy to this darkly lit world of drug deals, shootouts and senseless killings.  Particularly interesting is the way Reyes explains the geography of the drug-dealing world, with each section of the city apportioned off to the exact square inch among rival ""businesses."" But as the story spins off in another direction, it loses some of its credibility and begins to feel less and less authentic and more and more contrived.  The film is obviously intended as a cautionary tale, but we can't help but notice how much it has to sweat and strain to make its point.In addition to Leguizamo, there are fine performances by Peter Sarsgaard, Denise Richards, Delilah Cotto and Isabella Rossellini.

Rappers Fat Joe and Treach add to the street flavor. Classic beauties Isabella Rossellini and Sonia Braga add to the exotica. The plot however really thins out when you realize Legs' character has given this hot shot investor over 3 million in cash in a suitcase...now, what would you do with alla that dough? That's right. The boy and his girl (the ueber babe/semi-actress Denise Sheen...uh...Richards) skips off to South Beach. Not too far from the Versace Mansion. From there it gets messier. What else is wrong with the film? 'Empire', the title. It leads one to believe the protagonist is gonna be so high up the ladder that he's a mover and shaker.....not a street thug. In fact,  the only regal person worth of the title was the Rossellini character. Other than that, it's an alright show.",3,Did you see it coming?
