584067,A16XAW90Q8O71O,B00005JIX5,Albatross Necklace,"[1, 1]","This is a comedy adventure in a fantasy setting like Slayers, Ruin Explorers, Dragon Half, Sorcerer Hunters, Bastard, etc. It is fun and very comfortable for those who enjoy the genre but does nothing to stand out from the crowd. It is the same group of likable characters that you tend to see in other comedic adventure anime. It is not as funny as Dragon Half and doesn't quite have the charm of Ruin Explorers, I think it would be best described as slightly more serious Slayers with a male protagonist.The streaming version is dubbed and is not afflicted by the buffering problem that many of the new Prime anime streaming releases have.The draw back is that season 1 is at the time of this review, is still for pay to Prime members. This means that the free streaming of season 2 is a little out of place.I would not say that the series is good enough to pay 2$ per episode to see season 1 in preparation for watching this season, though one might consider buying the DVD box set or just waiting for them to put season 1 on Prime.",3,Average comedy adventure in a fantasy setting,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,1035,"['comedy', 'adventure', 'fantasy', 'setting', 'Slayers', 'Ruin', 'Explorers', 'Dragon', 'Half', 'Sorcerer', 'Hunters', 'Bastard', 'etc', 'fun', 'very', 'comfortable', 'who', 'enjoy', 'genre', 'nothing', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', 'same', 'group', 'likable', 'characters', 'tend', 'see', 'other', 'comedic', 'adventure', 'anime', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Dragon', 'Half', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'charm', 'Ruin', 'Explorers', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'slightly', 'more', 'serious', 'Slayers', 'male', 'protagonist.The', 'streaming', 'version', 'dubbed', 'not', 'afflicted', 'buffering', 'problem', 'many', 'new', 'Prime', 'anime', 'streaming', 'have.The', 'draw', 'back', 'season', '1', 'time', 'review', 'still', 'pay', 'Prime', 'members', 'free', 'streaming', 'season', '2', 'little', 'place.I', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'series', 'good', 'enough', 'pay', '2', 'episode', 'see', 'season', '1', 'preparation', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'might', 'consider', 'buying', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'just', 'waiting', 'put', 'season', '1', 'Prime']",N/A

584070,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00005JIX5,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","For the record, the beginning of  ""Orphen Revenge"" is not very much like the first season of ""Orphen"" -- it's more like a grumpier version of ""Slayers.""Not that that's an entirely bad thing -- just different. ""Orphen Season 2 - Revenge (Vol. 1)"" is a rather fluffy beginning to the series' second season, with plenty of comic relief, a bit of gender-bending, and Orphen's increasingly stressful search for hot water and food. But there are some subtle (okay, not subtle) hints that there's something nasty in the offing for Orphen and Co., which may have inspired the sub-title ""Revenge.""A very reluctant Orphen and Majik set out with Cleao to the city of Seiun, reknowned for its hot springs. But when the hotel owners see Orphen's face, then immediately freak out and reject the trio -- mainly because the town's tinpot dictator Don Bonaparte is terrified that a sorcerer will discover their secret. Desperate to get Cleao into a hot spring so they can leave, Orphen blasts his way to the source of Don Bonaparte's hot springs... only to discover a shocking secret in a nearby mountain.He also encounters Lycoris, an agent of the Royal Public Order of Knighthood who says that they want him -- and of course, Orphen is totally uninterested. But he lets Lycoris tag along because the Order will pay his bills.And Orphen has non-knighthood problems to deal with: enormous freakish monsters keep attacking the party, and seem to be targeting him alone. A bizarre incident convinces Cleao that the inoffensive Lycoris is a tentacled monster out to ""eat our sweet sweet brains!"", and the bombastic troll Volcan becomes possessed by a very feminine ghost who needs to skip stones in a magical lake. Yes, he does wear a dress.There's not much story substance to the first volume of ""Orphen Revenge"" -- it's mostly about our heroes meandering around and being attacked by monsters, when Orphen's companions aren't slowly driving him insane with stress (""MY FRIEND.... NEEDS... A BAAAAAAAATH!""). But there are some plot threads of darker stuff -- a shadowy figure that is plotting Orphen's downfall, and a bunch of monsters with nebulous origins.And along the way, there's some action-comedy worthy of ""Slayers"" -- lots of Orphen blowing things up and kicking butt against increasingly bizarre foes (such as possessed mannequins with sickles!), usually yelling abuse at them. And the fluffy plots have as plenty of comic relief and running jokes (Lycoris loses her glasses every time there's a literal bump in the road); the entire fourth episode is basically comedic fluff that rides on the idea of Volcan in a frilly pink dress.And while the English dub dialogue rarely matches the original Japanese (Orphen's attack names are usually rewritten as macho yells of ""Show me what you're made of!"" et cetera), it tends to be snappy and amusing (""That's an interesting point you make, Cleao... and by interesting, I mean STUPID!""). David Matranga gives Orphen a rough-edged, mildly sarcastic voice, while Shelley Calene-Black, Spike Spencer and Luci Christian do excellent jobs as well.Orphen himself seems to have gotten over the angst of the previous season -- he's sarcastic, grumpy, and perpetually surrounded by idiots and annoyances who make his life far more stressful than it needs to be. I mean, the poor guy can't even sleep in his own bed without Cleao blowing him up, forcing him to repair the hotel, and then dragging him off on her hunt for the perfect spa. No wonder he blows off steam by tying up Majik.Cleao herself is a fun character, an arrogant ""princess"" type who is more perceptive than people assume and definitely gutsy enough to tell off local dictators. Majik is a suitably mild-mannered sidekick, and Lycoris is an unusual addition to the cast -- a timid, prim gal with glasses, braids and an iron-clad determination to drag Orphen into knighthood. The only flaws are Volcan and Dirtan, who continue to be as funny as an infected boil.With some hints of future dark'n'nasty events to come, the first volume of ""Orphen Revenge"" is nevertheless a fluffy affair balanced out between action and comedy.

584073,A3CFNVFTZHONG9,B00005JIX5,"J. N. K ""Esco""","[2, 2]","My first experience with Orphen was with the PS2 game.  While I do agree with many of the negative remarks about the game, I ended up liking it a decent amount simply because the relationships between the five pre-existing characters (Cleo, Magnus AKA Majik, Vulcon, Dortin and, of course, Orphen) was unlike any other RPG or story I had encountered.  Orphen was only a hero for two reasons: 1) he was incredibly good at sorcery, and 2) being a hero meant he got to get off that stupid crazy deathtrap island.  Orphen is a hero who is lazy, greedy, and usually doesn't give a damn.  He travels with two companions, who constantly annoy the hell out of him.  That was amusing!So, soon afterward, I heard that it was based on an anime series, and after some searching, I stumbled upon this DVD in the &quot;New Releases&quot; section at a local movie store.  I popped it in, and I was quite pleased.  The attitude, while toned down (due to it being the first episode -- the tension hadn't built up yet) was the same.  The best part is right at the end, where Cleo says to Orphen: &quot;I can be nice and caring if I wanted to be!&quot; and Orphen replies with a tone I came to expect: &quot;No you couldn't.&quot;The plot in this trilogy of episodes is quite marvelous.  It's about Orphen hunting down an evil dragon called &quot;The Bloody August,&quot;  but it's really not a good vs. evil scenario, since it would seem Orphen is slightly evil, but rather it's a better evil taming the worse evil.  While Orphen is aiding the evil dragon, while also protecting the good from it, he is being hunted by his former collegue sorcerors who want to destroy the dragon, because there is a story behind the dragon they do not know.  I won't spoil it; see it.My final verdict is that this DVD is quite nice.  Both tracks are amusing, since both are well acted, and the writing in both are actually different (the American track is meaner).  While each episode is short, and it would be accurate to state that the first episode of the trilogy is really just character development of Orphen, Cleo and Majik.  It is dramaic, comedic, and fantastic.  Now that a second DVD is out, and a third on the way, I cannot wait!

Season has a story, but the viewer must find it amongst the comedy.  Orphen, Magic, Cleo and Leki (voiced by the same voice actors from the first Orphen) are going to some hot springs for a little R &amp; R.  Once they reach the resort town they discover that no one wants to give them any shelter.  Also a mysterious glasses-dependent girl is following them, she wants Orphen's help (the reason is never made clear in any of the four episodes).  Volkin and Dortin still refuse to pay their debt and someone is out to get Orphen...but who and why?The animation is NOT as good as the first.  The characters seem to have lost weight and look more cartoonish.  What I find strange is that when Orphen uses his powers the background is reminiscent of some 60's psychedelic drug-induced vision.  The outtakes are a special treat (I enjoyed their references to &quot;American Pie&quot; and Eddie Murphie's &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;).If your an Orphen fan you will enjoy it but if your not familiar with Orphen I STRONGLY suggest you watch the first season before you see season two.  Enjoy the story and small touches of humor of season one before you dive into the comedy saturated season 2.If you're a parent, its best not to let your small children see this (the opening sequence has Orphen and Cleo in bed together, the first comedic sequence soon follows) and the language used in the outtakes are best appreciated by a mature ear.",4,More Comedy...less story,1071705600,"12 18, 2003",2003,1506,"['Orphen', 'Season', '1', '5', 'stars', 'unfortunately', 'season', 'two', 'only', '4', 'Season', 'story', 'viewer', 'must', 'find', 'amongst', 'comedy', 'Orphen', 'Magic', 'Cleo', 'Leki', 'voiced', 'same', 'voice', 'actors', 'first', 'Orphen', 'are', 'going', 'hot', 'springs', 'little', 'R', 'amp', 'R.', 'Once', 'reach', 'resort', 'town', 'discover', 'one', 'give', 'shelter', 'Also', 'mysterious', 'glasses-dependent', 'girl', 'following', 'Orphen', 'help', 'reason', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'four', 'episodes', 'Volkin', 'Dortin', 'still', 'refuse', 'pay', 'debt', 'someone', 'out', 'get', 'Orphen', 'who', 'why', 'animation', 'NOT', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'lost', 'weight', 'look', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'What', 'find', 'strange', 'when', 'Orphen', 'powers', 'background', 'reminiscent', '60', 'psychedelic', 'drug-induced', 'vision', 'outtakes', 'are', 'special', 'treat', 'enjoyed', 'references', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'Eddie', 'Murphie', 'quot', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'quot', '.If', 'Orphen', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'not', 'familiar', 'Orphen', 'STRONGLY', 'suggest', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'see', 'season', 'two', 'Enjoy', 'story', 'small', 'touches', 'humor', 'season', 'one', 'dive', 'comedy', 'saturated', 'season', '2.If', ""'re"", 'parent', 'best', 'not', 'let', 'small', 'children', 'see', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Orphen', 'Cleo', 'bed', 'together', 'first', 'comedic', 'sequence', 'soon', 'language', 'used', 'outtakes', 'are', 'best', 'appreciated', 'mature', 'ear']",N/A

Having said that, I'm not quite sure what drew me to this title, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.One of my favorite things about this anime is Orphen himself - he does not look like your typical main character. With his leather jacket, black pants, and red headband, he looks like a bad guy, but looks are decieving. Orphen is a very interesting character with a mysterious past, and by the end of the first episode, the viewer knows that there's a lot more to this story than they've been shown so far.These first three episodes are like a trilogy; they all run into each other to make one long story designed to introduce us to the anime, and it does this well. We are introduced to Orphen's student Majik and a girl named Cleo who has a crush on Orphen, but would never admit it. We also meet the troll Volcan and his sister, Dortan. Volcan's anti-Orphen attitude is quite amusing, though he can become quite annoying at times.This show has well-placed comedy and a very good story; one that left me excited and interested in what the next volume held in store. Needless to say, I threw the second disc in my DVD player as soon as the third episode finished.What amazes me most is that this show could have such a strong hold on me when I'm not particularly into fantasy.
