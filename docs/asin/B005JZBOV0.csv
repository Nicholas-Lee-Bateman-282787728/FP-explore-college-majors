MUSIC OF THE HEART WAS the movie I thought I would like the least. I did not think a movie about a bunch of inner-city elementary kids learning to play a violin would hold my interest. I was so wrong! This movie tugged at my heart strings. Before watching this movie I never listened to violin music. MUSIC OF THE HEART gave me an appreciation for this instrument the violin and the beautiful music it produces. MERYL STREEP was amazing in the role of Roberta Guaspari fighting to teach violin to students in a rough inner-city. However, it was the children who were the real stars of this movie.
