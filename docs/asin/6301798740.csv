268557,A1HTD9JCUA9O39,6301798740,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This movie is a classic gem.It's about a vacation lead by a father (Stewart) who is very much against taking the whole family which includes two adult daughters and their families, a young self-conscious daughter with braces, and a son who's a TV junkie.  The mother (O'Hara) convinces him to go.At first, Stewart is very disconnected from all the family members (except his wife) but as the movie goes on he gets closer to each child.  The things he goes through to get to that point are great humor.My favorite part of the movie is when the Turners show up to stay for a few days.  This couple is into nothing since neither person wants to do anything the other doesn't want to do.  It looks like they're going to be a couple of duds but they both end up being some of the comedic highlights of the movie.If you like Stewart and O'Hara I'm sure you'll like this movies.",5,I love Stewart and this movie,1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,871,"['movie', 'classic', 'gem.It', 'vacation', 'lead', 'father', 'Stewart', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'taking', 'whole', 'family', 'two', 'adult', 'daughters', 'families', 'young', 'self-conscious', 'daughter', 'braces', 'son', 'who', 'TV', 'junkie', 'mother', ""O'Hara"", 'go.At', 'first', 'Stewart', 'very', 'disconnected', 'family', 'members', 'wife', 'movie', 'closer', 'child', 'things', 'get', 'point', 'are', 'great', 'humor.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'Turners', 'show', 'up', 'stay', 'few', 'days', 'couple', 'nothing', 'person', 'do', 'anything', 'other', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'couple', 'duds', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'comedic', 'highlights', 'movie.If', 'Stewart', ""O'Hara"", ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movies']",Mr Hobbs Takes a Vacation VHS

268559,A183HC5Z54FJFX,6301798740,April Kempler,"[0, 0]","Before I watched the Special Features that came with this DVD I thought how similar this movie was to Father of the Bride: father driven slightly insane by the rapid changes in his family. I could even picture Steve Martin in the role of Mr. Hobbs, if the powers that be ever did a remake (as they so often do with classics). Low and behold, Edward Streeter, author of Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation is also the author of Father of the Bride. There were definite similarities between the two stories.If you love the classic (and not so classic remake) of Father of the Bride, you will love Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation. James Stewart is endearing in his role of a father trying to re-connect with his growing family and by extension his  sons-in-law, who he neither knows very well or doesn't particularly care for. Maureen O'Hara is simply stunning. The rest of the actors I didn't know at all, except for Fabian, who was from my mother's generation and she used to go nuts over him. Fabian has a minor role in the film as the youngest daughter's love interest. He goes from clean-cut young man to bearded beatnik for some unexplained reason, but he is still pretty cute.There are certain adult themes, but nothing graphic or immoral. I did object to Mr. Hobbs saying the only thing his son Danny (who is roughly fourteen) needs from him is picking up an issue of Playboy magazine every month. But, maybe  the content was more a gentleman's magazine back in those days. I wouldn't really know, since I don't subscribe to that kind of magazine anyway! But, it seems certain reviewers were offended by the remark.This movie also reminded me of Summer Rental, the John Hughes film with John Candy. Candy, in the role of an over-worked father on the brink of a nervous breakdown, rents a beach house for relaxation, but experiences anything but.While I personally enjoyed this movie and laughed out loud at the antics (even the old dilapidated house the family rents is a character in this movie), I wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for the good, clean fun of a Disney movie, or Annette Funicello in Beach Blanket Bingo, or Gidget, for that matter. Just because it is an older film does not make the theme suitable for everyone. Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation plays more like the adult comedies of the sixties (e.g., Pillow Talk, or the Odd Couple).The cover art is what initially grabbed me. Mr. Hobbs is shown on the beach reading War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy. I was reading that book myself at the time, and it was strongly on my mind. Also, I loved the literary references throughout the movie: Lolita (Nabokov), Dragonwyk (Seton), and The Brothers Karamazov (Dostoyevsky, which I am currently reading).If you like old-fashioned comedy, that is ever-so slightly suggestive, then I recommend Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation.",5,"Iconic family movie in the vein of Summer Rental, with John Candy.",1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,2818,"['watched', 'Special', 'Features', 'came', 'DVD', 'thought', 'how', 'similar', 'movie', 'was', 'Father', 'Bride', 'father', 'slightly', 'insane', 'rapid', 'changes', 'family', 'could', 'even', 'picture', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'powers', 'be', 'ever', 'did', 'remake', 'so', 'often', 'do', 'classics', 'Low', 'behold', 'Edward', 'Streeter', 'author', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'Vacation', 'also', 'author', 'Father', 'Bride', 'were', 'definite', 'similarities', 'two', 'stories.If', 'love', 'classic', 'not', 'so', 'classic', 'remake', 'Father', 'Bride', 'will', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'Vacation', 'James', 'Stewart', 'endearing', 'role', 'father', 'trying', 're-connect', 'growing', 'family', 'extension', 'sons-in-law', 'who', 'very', 'well', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'simply', 'stunning', 'rest', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Fabian', 'who', 'was', 'mother', 'generation', 'used', 'go', 'nuts', 'Fabian', 'minor', 'role', 'film', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'love', 'interest', 'clean-cut', 'young', 'man', 'bearded', 'beatnik', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'still', 'pretty', 'are', 'certain', 'adult', 'themes', 'nothing', 'graphic', 'immoral', 'did', 'object', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'saying', 'only', 'thing', 'son', 'Danny', 'who', 'roughly', 'fourteen', 'picking', 'up', 'issue', 'Playboy', 'magazine', 'month', 'maybe', 'content', 'was', 'more', 'gentleman', 'magazine', 'back', 'days', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'subscribe', 'kind', 'magazine', 'anyway', 'certain', 'reviewers', 'were', 'offended', 'remark.This', 'movie', 'also', 'reminded', 'Summer', 'Rental', 'John', 'Hughes', 'film', 'John', 'Candy', 'Candy', 'role', 'over-worked', 'father', 'brink', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'beach', 'house', 'relaxation', 'anything', 'but.While', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'antics', 'even', 'old', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'family', 'character', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'someone', 'looking', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'Beach', 'Blanket', 'Bingo', 'Gidget', 'matter', 'Just', 'older', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'theme', 'suitable', 'everyone', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'Vacation', 'more', 'adult', 'comedies', 'sixties', 'e.g.', 'Pillow', 'Talk', 'Odd', 'Couple', '.The', 'cover', 'art', 'what', 'initially', 'grabbed', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'shown', 'beach', 'reading', 'War', 'Peace', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'was', 'reading', 'book', 'time', 'was', 'strongly', 'mind', 'Also', 'loved', 'literary', 'references', 'movie', 'Lolita', 'Nabokov', 'Dragonwyk', 'Seton', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'Dostoyevsky', 'am', 'currently', 'reading', '.If', 'old-fashioned', 'comedy', 'ever-so', 'slightly', 'suggestive', 'then', 'recommend', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'Vacation']",Mr Hobbs Takes a Vacation VHS

Nuce,"[5, 7]","SynopsisMr. Hobbes (James Stewart) has planned a small family outing with his wife (Maureen O'Hara) and teenage son, but things quickly grow bigger than he had planned when his wife invites his grown up daughters, son-in-law's, and grandchildren along as well.  Leaky plumbing is the least of the problems that are caused.Sexual ContentA woman spends most of the film scantily clad in a bikini and other bathing suits (when she is first seen, she had the back to her bikini undone).  Whether innocent or not, the woman makes many overtures to Mr. Hobbes and his son-in-law.  Mr. Hobbes laughs it off, but his son-in-law apparently does not (it is possible that the two have an affair).  Mr. Hobbes manages to save his daughter's marriage, but not before some infidelity (of the heart, at least) takes place.  When his other son-in-law's boss comes to visit, Mr. Hobbes accidentally finds himself locked in a bathroom with the man's drunk wife.  She is nude (we don't see ANY private areas), but not very attractive.  Mr. Hobbes mentions buying playboy magazines for his teenage son.ViolenceA few fist-fights which end after a punch or two.  Some comic pratfalls.LanguageA few semi-dirty jokes that will probably pass over the little kids heads.  A few scattered d-words and h-words.MoralesMr. Hobbes drinks and smokes, but is never shown getting drunk.  He is faithful to his wife and gets slightly jealous when he is not as sure of her faithfulness.  His parental style is loving, but not very effective.  He is willing to lie to get out of problems.  His son is obsessed with television, but Mr. Hobbes goes out of his way to get his son interested in other things.  His daughter's marriages both are slightly troubled, but as the film goes on, the problem's are worked out.ConclusionMr. Hobbes Takes a Vacation is a lot of fun.  No one can deny that.  James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara are hilarious to watch in their middle years, and the antics of their children and grandchildren are equally hilarious.  However, what would be a great family film is marred by some troubling content.  Hobbes is no classic because it lacks the family values of Little House on the Prairie or even Yours, Mine, and Ours.A fun little movie, but not a must-see.

It also is a tale of a father's effort to understand their children, and the difficulties that can involve. So the movie is good couple of hours.

268577,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6301798740,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","MR. HOBBS TAKES A VACATION (Dir. Henry Koster (best known forFlower Drum Song) 1962, 120 minutes, note erroneous listings that state 116 minutes, based on the novel) is a weird sort of film that you can comfortably drink in~ or you can hate it at first sight. I did the former, because the stars deserved that respect as did the script.Jimmy Stewart plays banker Roger Hobbs, which in fact is simply Jimmy Stewart being Jimmy Stewart. This lighthearted family comedy is so much the better for it: Stewart had an elegant, easy comic timing like Spencer Tracy, and that really makes this film. Hobbs decides to give in to wifey's idea about a summer holiday (and what man can resist Maureen O'Hara even today). The idea is to accept the offer of a summer house along the beachfront~ and drag the entire family together for that holiday.With a teen son and daughter, plus two married daughters with children, poor Mr. Hobbs is naturally lost and frustrated beyond measure, but by God, this is Jimmy Stewart so we learn quickly that he is the world's greatest dad.There is also a beauty to this sort of comedic endeavor that only film buffs can appreciate: several references to Stewart's past films are made at lightning speed. A number of muted references made here and there, like little homages to other films of the era (such asThe Ghost & Mrs. Muir (1947) DVD - Gene Tierney, Rex Harrison, George Sanders, Edna Best, see if you catch that homage). Homage to the work of Jacques Tati is present throughout this film. For me, the funniest line in the film is when Stewart is watching TV with his boy and remarks, ""Yeah, that Wyatt Earp was awfully quick with a gun.""This is also a pearl of a film because it predated the so-called ""oddball"" comedies of the mid-to-late-1960s. It towers over the garbage Bob Hope was doing at the same time, but it is also happily devoid of a completely mad number of superstars jammed into one film, all trying to be funny. Even Spencer Tracy made the error of doing one of those ""oddball"" films~ but not Stewart and certainly not O'Hara.My singular complaint is everyone seemed like cardboard cutouts, with the exception of Stewart, and I felt the film really fell short on that score. Too much screen time for Fabian singing a silly tune right in the middle of the film, yet the only other character who really came to life was the Hobbs Family's Finnish cook. But I will say one thing made up for that: this is the first movie I know to have a veteran birdwatcher in it, and as such the film struck me as a precursor ofThe Big Year(which actually paid homage to HOBBS, see my review).I beg to add, this film is the inspiration for all the National Lampoon Chevy Chase VACATION films (a small sampling:The Ultimate Vacation Collection (National Lampoon's Vacation / Vegas Vacation / European Vacation / Christmas Vacation)), and inspired a few others such as the incredibly funny and goofy Chevy Chase vehiclesModern Problemsand my late mother's favorite Chase comedyFunny Farm (1988)along with things like THE BIG YEAR.SCENE THAT MAKES THE ENTIRE FILM: watch for Jimmy Stewart and his teen son out in a little boat, something called a Spatterbox or some such nonsense. They get lost in a fog and the fear evidenced by both of them is palpable and touching. I loved the moment when the intrepid teen boy simply reached over and clung to dad for comfort. This was reminiscent of Spencer Tracy inThe Old Man And The Sea(see my review).Get this, if you dig the era and you like comedy. Get it for certain if you are a Stewart buff, since I think it is one of his finest performances. It's a fine family film (possible exception: a prominent shot of Fabian's incredibly gorgeous derriere in tight white pants). This film communicates a family message that no family should miss.",4,A good family comedy for Father's Day,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,3809,"['MR.', 'HOBBS', 'TAKES', 'A', 'VACATION', 'Dir', 'Henry', 'Koster', 'best', 'known', 'forFlower', 'Drum', 'Song', '1962', '120', 'minutes', 'note', 'erroneous', 'listings', 'state', '116', 'minutes', 'based', 'novel', 'weird', 'sort', 'film', 'can', 'comfortably', 'drink', 'in~', 'can', 'hate', 'first', 'sight', 'did', 'former', 'stars', 'deserved', 'respect', 'did', 'script.Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'banker', 'Roger', 'Hobbs', 'fact', 'simply', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'being', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'lighthearted', 'family', 'comedy', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Stewart', 'had', 'elegant', 'easy', 'comic', 'timing', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'really', 'film', 'Hobbs', 'give', 'wifey', 'idea', 'summer', 'holiday', 'what', 'man', 'can', 'resist', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'even', 'today', 'idea', 'accept', 'offer', 'summer', 'house', 'beachfront~', 'drag', 'entire', 'family', 'together', 'teen', 'son', 'daughter', 'two', 'married', 'daughters', 'children', 'poor', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'naturally', 'lost', 'frustrated', 'measure', 'God', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'learn', 'quickly', 'world', 'greatest', 'dad.There', 'also', 'beauty', 'sort', 'comedic', 'endeavor', 'only', 'film', 'buffs', 'can', 'appreciate', 'several', 'references', 'Stewart', 'past', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'lightning', 'speed', 'number', 'muted', 'references', 'made', 'here', 'there', 'little', 'homages', 'other', 'films', 'era', 'such', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', '1947', 'DVD', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Edna', 'Best', 'see', 'catch', 'homage', 'Homage', 'work', 'Jacques', 'Tati', 'present', 'film', 'funniest', 'line', 'film', 'when', 'Stewart', 'watching', 'TV', 'boy', 'remarks', 'Yeah', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'was', 'awfully', 'quick', 'gun', 'also', 'pearl', 'film', 'predated', 'so-called', 'oddball', 'comedies', 'mid-to-late-1960s', 'garbage', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'was', 'doing', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'happily', 'devoid', 'completely', 'mad', 'number', 'superstars', 'jammed', 'one', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'Even', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'made', 'error', 'doing', 'one', 'oddball', 'films~', 'not', 'Stewart', 'certainly', 'not', ""O'Hara.My"", 'singular', 'complaint', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'exception', 'Stewart', 'felt', 'film', 'really', 'fell', 'short', 'score', 'Too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Fabian', 'singing', 'silly', 'tune', 'right', 'middle', 'film', 'yet', 'only', 'other', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'came', 'life', 'was', 'Hobbs', 'Family', 'Finnish', 'cook', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'up', 'first', 'movie', 'know', 'have', 'veteran', 'birdwatcher', 'such', 'film', 'struck', 'precursor', 'ofThe', 'Big', 'Year', 'actually', 'paid', 'homage', 'HOBBS', 'see', 'review', 'beg', 'add', 'film', 'inspiration', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'VACATION', 'films', 'small', 'sampling', 'Ultimate', 'Vacation', 'Collection', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Vacation', '/', 'Vegas', 'Vacation', '/', 'European', 'Vacation', '/', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'inspired', 'few', 'others', 'such', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'goofy', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'vehiclesModern', 'Problemsand', 'late', 'mother', 'favorite', 'Chase', 'comedyFunny', 'Farm', '1988', 'things', 'BIG', 'YEAR.SCENE', 'MAKES', 'THE', 'ENTIRE', 'FILM', 'watch', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'teen', 'son', 'out', 'little', 'boat', 'something', 'called', 'Spatterbox', 'such', 'nonsense', 'get', 'lost', 'fog', 'fear', 'evidenced', 'palpable', 'touching', 'loved', 'moment', 'when', 'intrepid', 'teen', 'boy', 'simply', 'reached', 'clung', 'dad', 'comfort', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Old', 'Man', 'Sea', 'see', 'review', '.Get', 'dig', 'era', 'like', 'comedy', 'Get', 'certain', 'are', 'Stewart', 'buff', 'think', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'fine', 'family', 'film', 'possible', 'exception', 'prominent', 'shot', 'Fabian', 'incredibly', 'gorgeous', 'derriere', 'tight', 'white', 'pants', 'film', 'family', 'message', 'family', 'should', 'miss']",Mr Hobbs Takes a Vacation VHS

Nominated for several Academy Awards, Jimmy Steward won one and a Lifetime Achievement Award. Some of the unforgettable works include; Mr. Smith goes to Washington, Harvey, It's a wonderful life and Vertigo.If you collect the best movies of all times you will realize that Jimmy Stewart appears in many of them, staring in comedies, westerns, mysteries but always acting in films that the entire family can watch.He worked with many famous directors but our favorite is when he worked with Alfred Hitchcock.In this film, we see Jimmy Steward with a great cast: Maureen O'Hara playing his wife, Fabian, John Saxon and Marie Wilson among others. The movie starts by his writing a letter to his wife to let her know that the vacation they just took will never take place again and as he writes, the story opens to surface a wife that wants to take her family on a vacation and she has received the chance to use a friends house for the summer.When they arrive, the house is in such disrepair that it almost looks haunted and the fun starts as the kids, spoiled by the comforts of the city start to have to deal in an environment where much is missing... even running water.Some of the lines are rather cute, such as the lady that takes care of cooking leaving the family because Jimmy Stewart was ""swearing."" The couple stares at each other in disbelief because he never does and he says: What did I say this morning? I only asked my daughter to go with me to take some ""sun by the beach."" And at this, both become hysterical because the foreign help understood... SOB.If you want clean comedy, a view to simpler times, and great performances, this movie is highly recommended.

I have to admit movies I saw as a child often conjure up nostalgia, I loved going to the movies when I was young (initially brought by parents, later going with school friends).  So I may be guilty of over-rating this.  However, I bought the dvd and rewatched it happily.  James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara rent a ramshackle house on the ocean -- which reminded me of a house my parents rented on Long Beach Island, part of my ongoing identification with the film (sorry) -- and they bring their teenage daughter who doesn't want to be there, and their tv-addicted son.  And then their grown children show up, all with marriage and children problems.  Stewart is in his patented semi-annoyed, semi-willing comic mode; and pretty Maureen O'Hara is a pleasingly idealized wife and mother, attentive, sympathetic and calm.  I'm making it sound dull... sorry.  It's actually funny.Stewart has entertaining ""Walter Mitty-like"", in-his-head narration as he details his dire feelings as he deals with the boiler blowing up or with a badly behaved grandchild who has taken a hatred to him.  And there is a very funny visting-couple-from-hell (Marie Wilson and John McGiver) who show up and overstay their welcome, teetotalers until the last night when she goes drunk/seductive and he goes drunk/homicidal.  The teenage daughter (Lauri Peters, who I think played Liesel on stage in ""Sound of Music"") is taken to a painful dance where she can't meet anybody, until Stewart, feeling bad for her but being practical, starts to pay young men to go dance with her.  It ends up working out well, actually, since one of the guys, played by Fabian, actually likes her, and she comes out of her shell.

There is a running gag throughout the picture about the plumbing and the maid misunderstands the English language, and Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs try very hard to understand their adorable teen-age daughter (Lauri Peters) who falls in love with an adorable boy (played by none other than Fabian!), who shows up at the local dance and then there's a son who prefers to watch westerns on TV all day and night. There's a sexpot neighbor that lives in a nearby beach house who attempts to read War and Peace, and later the Hobb's daughters show up with the misbehaving grandchildren and want nothing to do with ""Boompa"", otherwise known as Mr.Hobbs! Don't miss the scene when Jimmy Stewart bird-watches with his son-in-in-law's boss and learns ""the proper walk"". The chemistry between Maureen O'Hara and James Stewart is so wonderful, it's no wonder they were so successful in several films together!

268617,A3MGDTPZVEDGR3,6301798740,phillindholm,"[9, 10]","""Mr. Hobbs Takes A Vacation"" is one of the most enjoyable family films ever made. When it was released back in 1962, it was a big hit. But if you are a sophisticate, don't write it off just yet. The plot is simple: Harried St. Louis banker Roger Hobbs (James Stewart) is looking forward to a quiet, romantic vacation with his wife Peggy (Maureen O'Hara) who, unknown to him, has instead opted for a family reunion in a rented Northern California beach house. Not only has she included her teenage daughter Katie and younger son Danny but her married daughters and their families as well. The beach house turns out to be a monstrosity which Hobbs describes as ""Dragonwyck"". When their daughter Susan and her husband Stan show up with their bratty kids, things quickly get worse. The family is complete when daughter Jane and her husband Byron arrive with their infant daughter. By now, both Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs are somewhat disenchanted with this ""family reunion"" as Susan and her husband fight until he walks out on them, while Jane's husband takes up with the local bathing suit-clad vamp Manika. Daughter Katie meanwhile, grows more sullen by the day, sulking because of her new braces and brother Danny simply glues himself to the television set. Add an unhappy Finnish maid and you really have a recipe for disaster. But thanks to the delightful performance by Stewart, the laughs come thick and fast. His dry wit enlivens the film and almost single-handedly keeps it alive. And I mean alive because in spite of a capable cast including Fabian, John McGiver and Marie Wilson, the film belongs to Stewart. He does wonders with his hapless father role and keeps the audience in his corner every second. With the support of the eternally beautiful O'Hara (who's hardly anyones idea of a grandmother) and a memorable Henry Mancini score, ""Mr. Hobbs"" may depict a harrowing ""vacation"" but it's one the the viewer will thoroughly enjoy taking. The film has just been released on a beautiful widescreen DVD, with an original trailer and a few other extras. Bon Voyage!

All this, combined with Stewart's droll third-person narration (""Mr. Hobbs gravely surveyed the scene.""), make a great view of the American vacation.Everyone has had vacations so bad that they become the lifeblood of all future family storytimes - and the times that you remember with the greatest fondness.

Easing into the grandpa stage of his career, James Stewart is the centre of the storm, the grumpy family man who finds his wife (Maureen O'Hara) has taken a house on the coast with the idea of not only taking their two youngest children with them but also their two married daughters and their husbands. Naturally it's a recipe for disaster - the house looks like Norman Bates was renting rooms and nobody's bothered to clean it after it since he went away to that nice hospital, the Heath Robinson-style generator becomes Stewart's mortal enemy, his youngest daughter (Lauri Peters) won't leave the house because she's too embarrassed about her braces and his youngest son (Michael Burns) takes the TV on vacation with him so he doesn't have to see the family, one of the grandchildren hates Stewart so much he throws things at him whenever he sees him, one husband (Josh Peine) storms off after a row while the other (John Saxon's smug professor) takes an interest in Valerie Varda's glamorous neighbor, Reginald Gardiner's yacht club bigwig takes a shine to O'Hara and they find themselves having to accommodate Peine's prospective employer, the puritanically uninteresting bird-watching teetotaller John McGiver and his wife Marie Wilson as well... the usual family holiday nightmares that make the grownups count the days until they can get back to the safety of work.Naturally everything eventually works out just as you expect it will, even if Stewart has to tell a few lies or bribe Fabian to date Peters, but there's a lot of fun to be had along the way. Like most vacations, it takes its time to get into the swing of things, and it's more an accumulation of gentle smiles and good humour than belly laughs, at least until McGiver memorably teaches Stewart the fundamentals of birdwatching in the film's funniest setpiece. But it's as sincerely likeable as many of Stewart's frustrations are all too recognisable from real life, keeping things for the most part focussed on sweating the small stuff to the maximum effect. It's well crafted by old studio hands like screenwriter Nunnally Johnson and director Henry Koster (who worked with Stewart on Harvey), with an easygoing score by Henry Mancini that initially takes its cue from Alain Roman's memorable theme for M. Hulot's Vacances before going off on its own direction.Twilight Time's region-free limited edition Blu-ray offers an excellent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with an isolated score track, trailer, Movietone Newsreel extract from a rather desperate publicity stunt and a booklet with notes by Julie Kirgo.",4,A feelgood Summer comedy that really does make you feel good,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,2894,"['house', 'good', 'enough', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'good', 'enough', 'Mr', 'Hobbs', 'Vacation', 'superior', 'example', 'all-but', 'forgotten', 'genre', 'family', 'comedy', 'film', 'aimed', 'whole', 'family', 'also', 'taking', 'aim', 'whole', 'notion', 'family', 'togetherness', 'even', 'not', 'loaded', 'bear', 'Easing', 'grandpa', 'stage', 'career', 'James', 'Stewart', 'centre', 'storm', 'grumpy', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'taken', 'house', 'coast', 'idea', 'not', 'only', 'taking', 'two', 'youngest', 'children', 'also', 'two', 'married', 'daughters', 'husbands', 'Naturally', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'house', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'was', 'renting', 'rooms', 'nobody', 'bothered', 'clean', 'went', 'away', 'nice', 'hospital', 'Heath', 'Robinson-style', 'generator', 'Stewart', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Lauri', 'Peters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'house', 'too', 'embarrassed', 'braces', 'youngest', 'son', 'Michael', 'Burns', 'TV', 'vacation', 'so', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'family', 'one', 'grandchildren', 'Stewart', 'so', 'much', 'things', 'whenever', 'one', 'husband', 'Josh', 'Peine', 'off', 'row', 'other', 'John', 'Saxon', 'smug', 'professor', 'interest', 'Valerie', 'Varda', 'glamorous', 'neighbor', 'Reginald', 'Gardiner', 'yacht', 'club', 'bigwig', 'shine', ""O'Hara"", 'find', 'having', 'accommodate', 'Peine', 'prospective', 'employer', 'puritanically', 'uninteresting', 'bird-watching', 'teetotaller', 'John', 'McGiver', 'wife', 'Marie', 'Wilson', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'family', 'holiday', 'make', 'grownups', 'count', 'days', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'safety', 'work.Naturally', 'everything', 'eventually', 'out', 'just', 'expect', 'will', 'even', 'Stewart', 'tell', 'few', 'lies', 'bribe', 'Fabian', 'date', 'Peters', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'way', 'most', 'vacations', 'time', 'get', 'swing', 'things', 'more', 'accumulation', 'gentle', 'smiles', 'good', 'humour', 'belly', 'least', 'McGiver', 'memorably', 'Stewart', 'fundamentals', 'birdwatching', 'film', 'funniest', 'setpiece', 'sincerely', 'likeable', 'many', 'Stewart', 'frustrations', 'are', 'too', 'recognisable', 'real', 'life', 'keeping', 'things', 'most', 'part', 'focussed', 'sweating', 'small', 'stuff', 'maximum', 'effect', 'well', 'crafted', 'old', 'studio', 'hands', 'screenwriter', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', 'director', 'Henry', 'Koster', 'who', 'worked', 'Stewart', 'Harvey', 'easygoing', 'score', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'initially', 'cue', 'Alain', 'Roman', 'memorable', 'theme', 'M.', 'Hulot', 'Vacances', 'going', 'off', 'own', 'direction.Twilight', 'Time', 'region-free', 'limited', 'edition', 'Blu-ray', 'excellent', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'isolated', 'score', 'track', 'trailer', 'Movietone', 'Newsreel', 'extract', 'rather', 'desperate', 'publicity', 'stunt', 'booklet', 'notes', 'Julie', 'Kirgo']",Mr Hobbs Takes a Vacation VHS
