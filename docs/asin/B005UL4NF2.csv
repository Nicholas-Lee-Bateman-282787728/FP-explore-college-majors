1504013,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B005UL4NF2,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[32, 34]","Season five takes flight immediately with a deliciously acerbic and dark-humored tale starring Lawrence Harvey, scream queen Hazel Court and Patrick Macnee that's a sumptuous treat from beginning to end, and with direction by Hitch, how can it possibly get any better? The 'abdominal snowman' (as he refers to himself) returns to the director's chair for the second episode that takes place on the Swiss Alps, reminiscent of his earlier British and first few American films, a saddening love story that takes place over the course of 40 years.From here, each and every episode is captivating, rewarding and worth several viewings - even though you may know the outcome, the way the stories are acted, directed and paced insures continuous entertainment and enjoyment, and how many TV shows can you say that about? The picture and audio are absolutely splendid, leaving little room for improvement - no blu-ray version necessary, IMO. The actors involved are among the best of the times (or any other before or since) - even those character actors you don't necessarily know by name but whose faces are familiar from your past as they were constantly utilized due to their consummate professionalism - and include Dick Van Dyke, Laurence Harvey, Suzanne Pleshette, Macdonald Carey, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn, Burt Reynolds, Edgar Buchannan, Walter Matthau, Brian Keith, Patrick Macnee (in several episodes that pre-date his nine year tenure on 'The Avengers'), Peter Lorre, Steve McQueen, William Shatner, Robert Morley, Harry Morgan, Jackie Coogan, Joseph Cotten, Raymond Massey, Dick York,  etc. The list goes on and on and is delightful to see these charming folks weave in and out of each episode. They bring something unique and special to the table to those of us who can ""remember when"".All prejudices aside, it seems to me that each season gets stronger and better than its predecessor and, like most other reviewers here, I hope we don't have to wait two years to get our sweaty little palms on the remainder of one of television's high points and template for the best drama that can come out of this medium. Long live Hitchcock, the master of mystery and suspense, peppered with some comically caustic black humor and sarcastic social commentary.",5,There's Only One 'Hitch'...,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,2258,"['Season', 'five', 'flight', 'immediately', 'deliciously', 'acerbic', 'dark-humored', 'tale', 'starring', 'Lawrence', 'Harvey', 'scream', 'queen', 'Hazel', 'Court', 'Patrick', 'Macnee', 'sumptuous', 'treat', 'beginning', 'end', 'direction', 'Hitch', 'how', 'can', 'possibly', 'get', 'better', ""'abdominal"", 'snowman', 'director', 'chair', 'second', 'episode', 'place', 'Swiss', 'Alps', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', 'British', 'first', 'few', 'American', 'films', 'saddening', 'love', 'story', 'place', 'course', '40', 'years.From', 'here', 'episode', 'captivating', 'rewarding', 'worth', 'several', 'viewings', 'even', 'may', 'know', 'outcome', 'way', 'stories', 'are', 'acted', 'directed', 'paced', 'insures', 'continuous', 'entertainment', 'enjoyment', 'how', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'picture', 'audio', 'are', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'leaving', 'little', 'room', 'improvement', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'necessary', 'IMO', 'actors', 'involved', 'are', 'best', 'times', 'other', 'even', 'character', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'know', 'name', 'are', 'familiar', 'past', 'were', 'constantly', 'utilized', 'due', 'consummate', 'professionalism', 'include', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'Macdonald', 'Carey', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Edgar', 'Buchannan', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Patrick', 'Macnee', 'several', 'episodes', 'pre-date', 'nine', 'year', 'tenure', ""'The"", 'Avengers', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Jackie', 'Coogan', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Dick', 'York', 'etc', 'list', 'delightful', 'see', 'charming', 'folks', 'weave', 'episode', 'bring', 'something', 'unique', 'special', 'table', 'who', 'can', 'remember', 'when', '.All', 'prejudices', 'aside', 'season', 'stronger', 'better', 'predecessor', 'most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'two', 'years', 'get', 'sweaty', 'little', 'palms', 'remainder', 'one', 'television', 'high', 'points', 'template', 'best', 'drama', 'can', 'come', 'medium', 'Long', 'live', 'Hitchcock', 'master', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'peppered', 'comically', 'caustic', 'black', 'humor', 'sarcastic', 'social', 'commentary']",Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Five

At the beginning of each show, he does a humorous introductory skit.  After the show reaches its conclusion, Alfred returns with an embellishment on the story.  Occasionally, even Hitchcock will get in on the fun and terminate a hapless actor or meet his own demise . . . .Most shows, or plays as Alfred likes to call them, involves death, either by murder, accident, or execution.  Each story is unique with a different set of actors.  As you might expect, all stories are not written to the same level, but most rate 4 or 5.  The stories that Hitchcock presents are known for their plot twists: the one you think is about to be murdered, is not, and many times, the real motives of the characters are not apparent until the last minute.If you are a fan of Twilight Zone, you will be surprised to learn that one of these shows is an earlier version of an episode that appeared during season five of Twilight Zone in 1964.  It's called: ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge""; a story of a man about to be summarily hanged off the side of a bridge during the American Civil War.

1504044,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B005UL4NF2,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[5, 5]","""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Five"" contains 38 episodes from the 1959-1960 season, including two -- ""Arthur"" and ""The Crystal Trench"" -- directed by Hitchcock himself.The shows are presented in the concise, half-hour format.  Hitchcock introduces and closes each program with humorous comments about the story at hand.  Some stars in Season Five episodes are Dick Van Dyke, Laurence Harvey, Robert Vaughn, William Shatner, Hermione Gingold, Joseph Cotten, Walter Matthau, Dick York, Raymond Massey, Mary Astor, and Suzanne Pleshette.  The Hitchcock shows were known for their twist or ironic endings and included mysteries, humorous tales, suspense yarns, ghost stories, and the occasional horror tale.There are a number of standout episodes in Season Five. In Roald Dahl's ""Man From the South,"" a fellow (Steve McQueen) agrees to an unusual wager that could result in the loss of more than cash.  In ""Specialty of the House,"" a gourmand (Robert Morley) eagerly desires to become a life member of an ultra-exclusive gourmet club and to see inside the usually off-limits kitchen.  ""Special Delivery"" is a creepy tale about a young boy who orders mushrooms through the mail and raises them as his parents begin to suspect their presence in the house is causing odd changes in their son.  ""Escape to Sonoita"" is an ironic take on human nature as two truck drivers (Burt Reynolds, James Bell) in the Arizona desert encounter kidnappers who steal their truck and leave them to die.Hitchcock's introductions and post-epsode commentary are always witty and original.  Hitchcock was busy making feature films (""North By Northwest,"" ""Psycho"") while his show was on the air, so he didn't have time to direct every episode.  His contract allowed him to direct only those he had a particular fondness for.  Other directors were hired for the balance of each season's episodes.",5,"Another first-rate season of mystery, suspense and sometimes horror",1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1870,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Presents', 'Season', 'Five', '38', 'episodes', '1959-1960', 'season', 'including', 'two', 'Arthur', 'Crystal', 'Trench', 'directed', 'Hitchcock', 'himself.The', 'shows', 'are', 'presented', 'concise', 'half-hour', 'format', 'Hitchcock', 'introduces', 'program', 'humorous', 'comments', 'story', 'hand', 'stars', 'Season', 'Five', 'episodes', 'are', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Hermione', 'Gingold', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Dick', 'York', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'Hitchcock', 'shows', 'were', 'known', 'twist', 'ironic', 'endings', 'included', 'mysteries', 'humorous', 'tales', 'suspense', 'yarns', 'ghost', 'stories', 'occasional', 'horror', 'are', 'number', 'standout', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Five', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'Man', 'South', 'fellow', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'unusual', 'wager', 'could', 'result', 'loss', 'more', 'cash', 'Specialty', 'House', 'gourmand', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'eagerly', 'become', 'life', 'member', 'ultra-exclusive', 'gourmet', 'club', 'see', 'usually', 'off-limits', 'kitchen', 'Special', 'Delivery', 'creepy', 'tale', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'orders', 'mushrooms', 'mail', 'parents', 'begin', 'suspect', 'presence', 'house', 'causing', 'odd', 'changes', 'son', 'Escape', 'Sonoita', 'ironic', 'take', 'human', 'nature', 'two', 'truck', 'drivers', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'James', 'Bell', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'encounter', 'kidnappers', 'who', 'steal', 'truck', 'leave', 'die.Hitchcock', 'introductions', 'post-epsode', 'commentary', 'are', 'always', 'witty', 'original', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'busy', 'making', 'feature', 'films', 'North', 'Northwest', 'Psycho', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'direct', 'episode', 'contract', 'allowed', 'direct', 'only', 'had', 'particular', 'fondness', 'Other', 'directors', 'were', 'hired', 'balance', 'season', 'episodes']",Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Five
