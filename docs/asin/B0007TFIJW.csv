The packaging, the sound, the direction-killer. It's hard to believe one band could have SO many great songs, and perform them all with sweat, passion and grace. If you've seen these guys live, this will remind you of why you had such a great time at the show...for those who havn't, I assure you this is the next best thing to being there-just without the over-zealous fan next to you spilling your beer as he rocks out to the best Southern rock band since Skynyrd.

889158,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B0007TFIJW,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[2, 2]","This is an outstanding concert featuring 3 excellent guitar players, songs with a Southern Theme, and three different vocalist on different songs. It also, includes stories told by band members about the South. The set list consists of 17 songs, then they are called out for an encore and play an additional 5 songs. It was filmed fairly recently at the 40 watt club in Athens, Georgia.The line-up consists of: Patterson Hood - guitars & vocals, Mike Cooley on guitars and vocals, Jason Isbell on guitars and vocals, Brad Morgan on drums, and Shonna Tucker on bass (I really like Shonna, she's talented and good looking). Four of the Five are from the Muscle Shoals Alabama area. I like the band member's southern accents!Some of the highlights include: ""The day John Henry died"", ""Carl Perkins Cadillac"", ""Never Gonna Chance"" (a reference to ""Freebird""), ""Cottonseed"", ""The Buford Stick"" (a reference about Buford Pusser in the movie :""Walking TAll""), ""the Southern Thing"", ""LookOut Mountain"" (in Alabama/Georgia), ""Decoration Day"" (about a family living down on Mobile Bay), ""Women without Whiskey"" (a reference to the late Ronnie Van Zant giving up Whiskey?), ""Shut up an Get on the Plane"" (a reference about the late Ronnie Van Zant boarding the plane that crashed carrying the Lynyrd Skynyrd Band - It's a great song and story about the late Ronnie Van Zant being ready to die if it's his time), and ""The People who Died"" (although this is a Jim Carrol Band song, it seems to be making a reference to the people who died on the Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash of 1977). Note, this band has released a ""Southern Rock Opera"" CD and included in the notes to this CD, they refer to ""Lynyrd Skynyrd"" as the Greatest Rock Band ever. They are paying respect and tribute to the ""Lynyrd Skynyd"" Band that went down in the plane crash of 1977 and the people who died in that crash.This is an excellent 3 guitar ""southern rock"" concert, that is very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it.

889160,A294SHLWPSG1BP,B0007TFIJW,Ryan Winkleman,"[2, 2]","Before you purchase this DVD, ask yourself one question: ""Am I ready to shake the walls and bring the house down?""  That is exactly what will happen if you put this concert film in.  The Drive-By Truckers--Patterson Hood, Mike Cooley, Brad Morgan, Jason Isbell, and Shonna Tucker--raise more hell than a meeting of Satanists.  The setlist is primarily composed of songs from their then-new release, ""The Dirty South,"" but it also contains good samplings from other albums, namely ""Southern Rock Opera"" and ""Decoration Day.""  Every song is great, though as one reviewer noted, certain staples like ""Let There Be Rock"" were not included.  The performances are tight but loose; it's clear that they know their stuff extremely well, but they don't stay strictly to the album recordings.  Each musician is in great form, and the three guitarists (Hood, Cooley, and Isbell) burn up the fretboards with their playing.This is one of the few DVDs I have seen where I can say that it genuinely feels like you're in the audience watching.  Plenty of shots of the band all together on stage mixed in with shots close enough to make you feel like you're in the front row watching the band, but not so close that you are really aware that you're a true outsider looking in.  It really does feel like you're there when the camera chooses to focus on one or two people at a time.  The stage can get a little dark at times, but never enough that it distracts from the viewing, and there is the occasional problem with the focus, but not as bad as one reviewer made it sound.  It's only a few times in the whole show.  Also interspersed with the songs are backstage interviews with the band, which give small amounts of insight into them.  One of the big highlights of the set is the fact that Mike Cooley married a couple onstage at one of the shows, and it's on this DVD.  Great to see him pronounce them man and wife and then get back to rocking after they exit.Bottom line is if you like the Drive-By Truckers, you will love this DVD.  The setlist and performances are all great, especially when the guys trade guitar solos.  It sounds awesome turned up loud and like I said, because of the camera positionings, you really do feel like you're in the audience watching them play.  Very highly recommended.",5,The Drive-By Truckers once again show that they are one of the best bands playing today,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,2290,"['purchase', 'DVD', 'ask', 'one', 'question', 'Am', 'ready', 'shake', 'walls', 'bring', 'house', 'down', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'put', 'concert', 'film', 'Drive-By', 'Truckers', 'Patterson', 'Hood', 'Mike', 'Cooley', 'Brad', 'Morgan', 'Jason', 'Isbell', 'Shonna', 'Tucker', 'raise', 'more', 'hell', 'meeting', 'Satanists', 'setlist', 'primarily', 'composed', 'songs', 'then-new', 'release', 'Dirty', 'South', 'also', 'good', 'samplings', 'other', 'albums', 'namely', 'Southern', 'Rock', 'Opera', 'Decoration', 'Day', 'Every', 'song', 'great', 'though', 'one', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'certain', 'staples', 'Let', 'Be', 'Rock', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'performances', 'are', 'tight', 'loose', 'clear', 'know', 'stuff', 'extremely', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'strictly', 'album', 'recordings', 'musician', 'great', 'form', 'three', 'guitarists', 'Hood', 'Cooley', 'Isbell', 'burn', 'up', 'fretboards', 'playing.This', 'one', 'few', 'DVDs', 'have', 'seen', 'where', 'can', 'say', 'genuinely', ""'re"", 'audience', 'watching', 'Plenty', 'shots', 'band', 'together', 'stage', 'mixed', 'shots', 'close', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'front', 'row', 'watching', 'band', 'not', 'so', 'close', 'are', 'really', 'aware', ""'re"", 'true', 'outsider', 'looking', 'really', 'feel', ""'re"", 'when', 'camera', 'focus', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'time', 'stage', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'dark', 'times', 'never', 'enough', 'viewing', 'occasional', 'problem', 'focus', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'one', 'reviewer', 'made', 'sound', 'only', 'few', 'times', 'whole', 'show', 'Also', 'interspersed', 'songs', 'are', 'backstage', 'interviews', 'band', 'give', 'small', 'amounts', 'insight', 'One', 'big', 'highlights', 'set', 'fact', 'Mike', 'Cooley', 'married', 'couple', 'onstage', 'one', 'shows', 'DVD', 'Great', 'see', 'pronounce', 'man', 'wife', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'rocking', 'exit.Bottom', 'line', 'like', 'Drive-By', 'Truckers', 'will', 'love', 'DVD', 'setlist', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'when', 'guys', 'trade', 'guitar', 'solos', 'awesome', 'turned', 'up', 'loud', 'said', 'camera', 'positionings', 'really', 'do', 'feel', ""'re"", 'audience', 'watching', 'play', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
