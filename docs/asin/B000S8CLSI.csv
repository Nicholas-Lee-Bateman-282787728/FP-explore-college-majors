The ignorance and lack of creativity demonstrated in the movie's title should have kept me away, unnecessarily abbreviating the word until (like the fast food marketing idiots of MacDonald's and Taco Bell) rather than using the word till.

Even one of the climatic execution scenes took me by surprise.2. It has lots of really good sexy scenes.  Some of the sex scenes were steamy hot, and some of them were funny.But most of all, the DVD is filled with a lot of extra stuff.  You could see that the people behind this film went that extra step every step of the way.

1085673,A2L36PB05OIX3P,B000S8CLSI,"C. Barr ""Craig  Barr""","[1, 1]","The film """"Ten Til Noon"" was brought to my attention from viewing ""Official Rejection."" This was the film that was shuffled from festival to festival. The narrative is of ten minutes before a ""Hit"" from different character perspectives. The sound track was effective enough for me to feel fear and I did not enjoy the movie as a recreational piece due to the combination for the soundtrack and the narrative, it was a plethora of the elements within human nature that I avoid-Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy & Pride. These are the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" which manifested and captured the tone of the film.  But man, it was very well made. The dialogue, camera work & lack of CG was impressive. I toy with short music video's but to create a film has to be a labor of love. Troma releases films made with camcorders and 8mm film and these films have a home made quality which is funny to see but not necessarily . I suggest acquiring the film ""Official Rejection"" and then view ""Ten Til Noon."" I was surprised at the professionalism even though I don't enjoy films about greed and murder. I think a film maker creating a Noir film needs some comedy which was missing here.

But the makers of this tripe used some very dubious techniques for making you think just that. The cover art certainly looks like Morgan Freeman...there's a review in the top left hand corner on the front that says Freeman in bold letters right above his picture.If I were Morgan Freeman I would look into this.The premise of the film was actually the only redeeming quality and so much could have been done with it. Nothing was.As for violence...well let me tell you about it. Two men are shot in the head, it's ok you don't see any blood as everyone knows bullet wounds to the head don't bleed. Umm...there's a scene where a man smacks his wife around a bit. And the opening scene where you see blood spatter but no actual victim. That sums up the movies violence so if that's what you're signing on for then you will be disappointed. The violence is unintentionally comical.Ok so that other male favorite movie staple...sex. O boys you're gonna love this...the one sex scene has the woman saying things like ""buckets of maggots...someone puking in your open mouth...puppies with their heads cut off."" And the other ""sex"" scene...is man on man action...replete with a man off camera talking ""with his mouth full"".Again if you think that arousing by all means have at it.Not a single actor was notable. Not that they had any sort of script to work with as the writing was even worse than the acting. I mean really...at one point a man tells his wife...""it's ok honey, we never have to speak of it again...it'll be like it never happened"" in regards to what can only be construed as her rape. The woman smiles and all is well.I can only wish it were that simple otherwise I would apply his sage advice to watching this film. Unfortunately, I think I need a long hot shower and a couple of drinks to scrub myself clean of this wretched wanna-be movie.On a side note..as of this writing there are 5 reviews for this film...I inspected the 3 rave reviews...they are the ONLY item on the reviewers page. Sounds to me like the makers of this film are trying to drum up some business by padding the ballot box.",1,It Doesn't Get Much Worse,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2459,"['ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'use', 'word', 'film', 'loosely', 'may', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'production', 'taped', 'school', 'mascot', 'written', 'lunch', 'lady.Seeing', 'film', 'shelf', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'may', 'be', 'duped', 'believing', 'starring', 'actor', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'assure', 'not', 'makers', 'tripe', 'used', 'very', 'dubious', 'techniques', 'making', 'think', 'just', 'cover', 'art', 'certainly', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'review', 'top', 'left', 'hand', 'corner', 'front', 'Freeman', 'bold', 'letters', 'right', 'picture.If', 'were', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'would', 'look', 'this.The', 'premise', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'Nothing', 'was.As', 'violence', 'well', 'let', 'tell', 'Two', 'men', 'are', 'shot', 'head', 'ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'blood', 'everyone', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'head', 'do', ""n't"", 'bleed', 'Umm', 'scene', 'where', 'man', 'wife', 'bit', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'blood', 'spatter', 'actual', 'victim', 'sums', 'up', 'movies', 'violence', 'so', 'what', ""'re"", 'signing', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'violence', 'unintentionally', 'comical.Ok', 'so', 'other', 'male', 'favorite', 'movie', 'staple', 'sex', 'O', ""'re"", 'gon', 'love', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'woman', 'saying', 'things', 'buckets', 'maggots', 'someone', 'puking', 'open', 'mouth', 'puppies', 'heads', 'cut', 'off', 'other', 'sex', 'scene', 'man', 'man', 'action', 'replete', 'man', 'off', 'camera', 'talking', 'mouth', 'full', '.Again', 'think', 'arousing', 'means', 'have', 'it.Not', 'single', 'actor', 'was', 'notable', 'Not', 'had', 'sort', 'script', 'work', 'writing', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'acting', 'mean', 'really', 'one', 'point', 'man', 'wife', 'ok', 'honey', 'never', 'have', 'speak', 'again', ""'ll"", 'be', 'never', 'happened', 'regards', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'construed', 'rape', 'woman', 'smiles', 'well.I', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'simple', 'otherwise', 'would', 'apply', 'sage', 'advice', 'watching', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'think', 'need', 'long', 'hot', 'shower', 'couple', 'drinks', 'scrub', 'clean', 'wretched', 'wanna-be', 'movie.On', 'side', 'note..as', 'writing', 'are', '5', 'reviews', 'film', 'inspected', '3', 'rave', 'reviews', 'are', 'ONLY', 'item', 'reviewers', 'page', 'makers', 'film', 'are', 'trying', 'drum', 'up', 'business', 'padding', 'ballot', 'box']",N/A
1085675,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000S8CLSI,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 1]","This is certainly a clever undertaking. And, for all the good in its cleverness, it might also be its own worst enemy.As others have noted, the story concerns a particular incident that takes 10 minutes to play out. The catch is that we see the same 10 minutes from the perspective of all the various players involved.For the most part it works well. Questions that arise early on get answered in the successive chapters. Where it falters is at the very end. The final scene caught me by surprise, and I couldn't quite believe it was over. It felt very abrupt and unsatisfying. There is a bit of irony in the ending that would have worked better with a more conventional approach to the structuring.That being said, this is still enjoyable. The performances range from so-so to decent. There weren't any that struck me as being stand-out. The production values were good enough and did little to distract from the proceedings.If you're looking for a light night out with a bit of the brain teaser thrown in this will suffice.

1085676,A13DRN82VK15ZF,B000S8CLSI,"Jerry Benjamin ""Film Geek""","[8, 11]","Saw this one during it's brief theatrical run and was BLOWN AWAY!  TEN 'TIL NOON is a highly original modern film noir with a terrific structural gimmick - the entire film takes place in a ten minute time span, between 11:50 and noon.  Each time the clock strikes noon, the film rewinds and places us in the point of view of a different character.  What we end up with is an incredibly layered web, with each new segment completely turning the story on it's head.  The result is invigorating.  I've never seen anything quite like it.TEN 'TIL NOON also has the requisite thriller elements, all in fine form - the femme fatales, the hitmen, the double-crosses, sex and violence galore.  But the unique story structure puts it over the edge into great filmmaking.  This is a fantastic, highly original indie film that demonstrates there are still new ways to tell a story.So glad this is FINALLY coming to DVD!!!  It bears many, many viewings.",5,Sensational Noir Thriller!,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,940,"['Saw', 'one', 'brief', 'theatrical', 'run', 'was', 'BLOWN', 'AWAY', 'TEN', 'NOON', 'highly', 'original', 'modern', 'film', 'noir', 'terrific', 'structural', 'gimmick', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'ten', 'minute', 'time', 'span', '11:50', 'noon', 'time', 'clock', 'strikes', 'noon', 'film', 'rewinds', 'places', 'point', 'view', 'different', 'character', 'What', 'end', 'up', 'incredibly', 'layered', 'web', 'new', 'segment', 'completely', 'turning', 'story', 'head', 'result', 'invigorating', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'it.TEN', 'NOON', 'also', 'requisite', 'thriller', 'elements', 'fine', 'form', 'femme', 'fatales', 'hitmen', 'double-crosses', 'sex', 'violence', 'galore', 'unique', 'story', 'structure', 'edge', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'fantastic', 'highly', 'original', 'indie', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'new', 'ways', 'tell', 'story.So', 'glad', 'FINALLY', 'coming', 'DVD', 'many', 'many', 'viewings']",N/A
