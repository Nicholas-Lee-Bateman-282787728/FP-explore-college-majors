cameo appearance long enough to make me laugh really really hard.it was difficult for me to follow the movie because the characters used thier human names for most of the movie.i had to keep a mental list of which characters had which abilities abnd which comic book characters they were.the real thing that bothered me was,once again,the movie makers tossed the real story right out the freaking window .professer x as an english hipster?the messed up original line up was all screwy too.i believe it was professer x,cyclops[not his brother havoc],angel[the boy one not a stripper girl who wasnt even the same race],beast,jean grey,and ice man.only half of them were in this movie.and dont go quoting the other x men movies because they are all messed up too.but,messed up facts aside,the movie was great!there was a lot of cool mutant stuff going on,a lot of questions answered,a huge amount of action and it was awesome.it was the ""revenge of the sith"" of the x-men movies.of which there are 5.i'd place this one 4th over all.but,i really like them all.so,4th is still spectacular.the characters they DO USE are a hipster professer X,beast,magneto[good guy],mystique[good girl],havoc,darwin,a girl angel,banshee,and a few others im probably forgetting.the movie focuses around magneto and professor X when they were still erik and charles.the bad guys were a blonde teklekinet ive never heard of,a red nightcrawler type guy,a unamed guy with the same powers of skull fire and some more.the original brotherhood of evil mutant members in the comics were magneto,blob,quicksilver,pyro,scarlet witch and toad.once again,not even close.HOWEVER,like i said,the movie is still an awesome movie.and i WOULD recomend you buy it.especialy if you are a comic book or action fan.it does have a lot of great scenes and it does answer tons of questions about how things happened.i mentioned ""revenge of the sith"" earlier.well,much in the same way as ""rots"" answered questioned about star wars,this movie answeres questions about the x-men trilogy and xmen in general.there are a lot of action scenes and military stuff going on that bridge between WW2 and the bay of pigs[1940's to 1962].so be ready for that.there are also a bunch of science scenes but not so much that it gets old like in ""the hulk"" and ""iron man"".as far as the actors and actresses go,i can only remember seeing one of them in any other movie.the CO on a battleship is a CO on the movie ""starship troopers"".but,i will admit i have trouble telling one blonde skank from another.they all look the same to me.plastic like a barbie doll and bottom feeders.so maybe theyve been around.and chances are they have.i think this one chick who i ended up hating in the movie may have been a girl i hated in ""batman begins""

It complimented the original movies very good, and had some great storylines of it's own. However, it played along as it was in the continuity of the other X-Men movies, but had some major errors in the timeline. This brought down the quality of the movie. Magneto seemed to be so childish, not thinking of anything but his petty revenge, unlike in the other movies thinking of the mutant cause. In the end of the movie he seemed like a puppet of Sabastian Shaw, even though Shaw is killed, Magneto takes up his cause.Regardless, I am still very pleased that X-Men broke the curse of ending on a third movie that so many movies fall into, or let themselves end on (spiderman, transformers, the new Batman movies, Jurassic Park, the Matrix). It's sad to see so many great movies not leading the group, but falling into a pattern of ending on the same number of movies.

1414929,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B004LWZW42,amerdale876,"[1, 2]","The latest edition of X-Men films, ""X-Men: First Class,"" is inspired by the 2006-2007 comic that showcased the beginnings of its most famous members beginning with Professor X, Angel, Beast, Cyclops, Iceman, and Jean Grey. However, in this film, the team roster includes Professor X, Magneto, Beast, Mystique, Banshee, Havok, Darwin, Sebastian Shaw, Emma Frost, Azazel, Riptide, and Angel (no, not that Angel - Angel Salvadore a.k.a. Tempest in the comics). Do not let the huge cast fool you, though; this film belongs to Charles Xavier/ Professor X (James McAvoy), and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender)! Although not accurate to all of the origins in the comic, ""First Class"" still successfully captures what makes the X-Men so great (and this coming from a guy who prefers DC Comics)! It does not take a philosophy major to tell you that the X-Men are an allegory for race relations, and this film - taking place first during the Nazis' cruel rule and genocide over the Jews in 1944, and then during the turbulent times of 1962 when race relations were at their most volatile - perfectly executes this allegory with its James Bond-type style, solid story and near-faultless character development.My first question when asking wondering about this film was, ""Is it canon with the first three X-Men films?"" The answer is a definite ""yes"" - especially with two particular surprise cameos in the film. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when the movie started because of the recycling of young Lensherr's first display of his magnetic powers (as seen in Bryan Singer's 2000 filmX-Men [Blu-ray]), but, fortunately, that is just the beginning of his - and the other mutants' - journey. I haven't been a big X-Men comic fan so I wasn't disappointed by the discrepancies of character origins. For those of you who are fans of the comic, trust me, the origins are greatly altered. One of the great additions to this film was Kevin Bacon as main villain Sebastian Shaw. Bacon has been in his share of hits as well as stinkers, and in most of those films, he's played a good guy. This time, his role proves two things. First, he can act, which is something most critics could tell you. Second, he should play a bad guy more often! Bacon's Shaw is a true villain whose mutant power makes him seem almost indestructible, and therefore, makes him a truly formidable foe. His inevitable defeat is carefully crafted and I think very well-executed. On the other hand, while January Jones' Emma Frost fits the physical traits of the character, her mercenary-like attitude and complex personality are not displayed so well. Many critics have panned Jones' performance, but I also blame the writers who merely didn't give her many good lines - or a history, for that matter - to work with. Still, who knows? Hopefully Frost's history will be explored in the inevitable sequel.One of the best aspects to this film is the relationship between Lensherr/Magneto and Xavier/Prof. X. One of the most powerful, well-acted scenes in the film is when Xavier is trying to teach Lensherr how to hone his magnetic power. Whereas Lensherr had merely used his anger to unleash his power, Xavier teaches him that finding the balance of anger and serenity can help intensify his power, making it possible to lift heavier objects. When Lensherr's memory is revealed to Xavier and the audience, the bond between McAvoy and Fassbender is both poignant and an inspired piece of acting; it captures the ""bromance"" relationship between the two in a touching way. And that's what this film is based in: the deep relationships between the characters. Their love, their fear, their anger; all of these emotions are what drive the characters in their actions as well as their relationships (i.e., Magneto and Prof. X; Mystique and Beast; Shaw and Magneto), and the writers (and director Matthew Vaughn) stylishly pulled it off. Bryan Singer tried to achieve this same tone in his 2000 debut of the franchise. However, while the original ""X-Men"" was good, it was not as good as this. I think it is because of the focus of characters. In the original, the main focus was on Rogue and Wolverine, and in this, the focus is on Professor X and Magneto. While Rogue and Wolverine have interesting backgrounds - particularly Wolverine who is practically immortal because of his regenerative healing - the two characters were not written well. There were so many aspects of their histories that could have been explored but were not (fortunately, Wolverine later got his own origin movie). In ""First Class,"" X and Magneto were focused on just right while also introducing the other assorted characters. There's something I love when the audience is given a glimpse into how a once-good person turns evil. These kinds of stories remind the viewer that anyone could go down this route because most people have a past that is not always pretty; and Lensherr's past is particularly horrifying. ""First Class"" simply gets it right!I have heard that this is the beginning of a new film trilogy and I surely hope so because this is by far the best of the franchise to date. I'm going to say that this is the best comic adaptation of the year! It balances the drama, action, humor and romance in all the right ways. Plus, let's face it; the explanation of Xavier's paralysis is so much better in this film than in the comic. This is one of those films that will be a hard act to follow, but it's finally a proper film for a great franchise. Now, if they could only get my two favorites - Daredevil and The Punisher - right! That would be uncanny.",5,"Four-and-a-half stars for the best Marvel comic adaptation (sorry, Iron Man)!",1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,5601,"['latest', 'edition', 'X-Men', 'films', 'X-Men', 'First',

I enjoyed the first film immensely but the second film was just plain for me.  I have yet to see the Wolverine film, may be I still might. This particular film is set against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis as Charles Xavier ( James Mcavoy) is recruited by Mona Mactaggert to assemble a team of mutants to prevent World War 3. Casting is perfect and includes Kevin Bacon as the villain.The film works because all the characters are extremely unique and besides their unique skills, bring a drama and emotion to the film.

1414933,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004LWZW42,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Origin films are pretty popular among the superhero alumni.  Every rabid fan of their favorite spandex-clad heroes wants to see their story done justice on the big screen, and an origin story is the preferable route considering that their humble beginnings are always to most interesting way to instill a renewed adoration for that said hero.`X-Men: First Class' is one of the latest in this genre (one of many to come out this year, which was basically superhero madness over the summer) and it works to a degree thanks to the acting that anchors the film's core.The film tells of the beginning of the X-Men, or more specifically, the beginning of Professor X and Magneto's rivalry.  As you probably already know, they started off friends and became enemies (but civil enemies) thanks to a conflict of interests and drastically differing attitudes towards cohabitation with humans (Magneto wants them dead, X wants to be their friends).  Here, we see a similar opening to the one witnessed in Bryan Singer's 2000 film, with Magneto (then known as Erik Lehnsherr) exhibiting his mutant abilities in a fit of rage after being separated from his mother in Nazi Germany.  We then get a small glimpse into the very different lives of Charles Xavier and Erik as one has a very posh and privileged upbringing and the other is subjected to experimental horrors because of his gifts.  Now, as adults, they come together in an effort to stop the evil Sebastian Shaw (who has a deeper connection to Erik) from destroying mankind.  To do this they gather a group of mutant teens who are eager to harness their abilities for the betterment of mankind.As a whole, this works.  The graphics are pretty amazing (those chains in the water were effectively eerie, and the whole Banshee water scene was fantastic) and the actors all pull out great performances, especially your two leads.  McAvoy and Fassbender are both exciting young leads.  They have already proven themselves as terrific Oscar caliber actors (watch `Atonement' or `Fish Tank' for proof of that) and they bring that polished actorly bravado to their respective roles here.  McAvoy flirts his way through the opening with charisma and charm and then effortlessly slips into a more mature take of his character, but it's Fassbender's chilling unveiling of Erik's intentions that really catch your breath.The main issue I have with this film is the first half.  It's sloppy.  Because this is essentially THREE origin stories (that of Xavier, Erik and the X-Men) it struggles to stay grounded while it jumps back and forth, and so it fails to build a real solid foundation for either of the main stars backstories, and it lazily slops together the actual X-Men team.  Some of the dialog and staging of the teens can be a little cheesy, but its forgivable considering that this is a superhero movie.  I just wish that they had been more focused in their storytelling, maybe shafting the actual X-Men team, which is vastly less interesting than Erik and Charles, and concentrated on building a powerful story surrounding those two comic book heavyweights.Alas, this is still a lot of fun, and the action never stops so that is a plus.  I'm a little confused as to why they decided to change the origins of the X-Men team (giving Alex Summers a starring role when he is the YOUNGER brother of Scott `Cyclops' Summers in the actual comic books was a bit strange), but this is a new spin on the franchise and so I guess it's OK.",4,Back to basics...,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,3471,"['Origin', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'popular', 'superhero', 'alumni', 'rabid', 'fan', 'favorite', 'spandex-clad', 'heroes', 'see', 'story', 'done', 'justice', 'big', 'screen', 'origin', 'story', 'preferable', 'route', 'considering', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'are', 'always', 'most', 'interesting', 'way', 'instill', 'renewed', 'adoration', 'said', 'hero.', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'one', 'latest', 'genre', 'one', 'many', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'was', 'basically', 'superhero', 'madness', 'summer', 'degree', 'thanks', 'acting', 'film', 'core.The', 'film', 'tells', 'beginning', 'X-Men', 'more', 'specifically', 'beginning', 'Professor', 'X', 'Magneto', 'rivalry', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'started', 'off', 'friends', 'became', 'enemies', 'civil', 'enemies', 'thanks', 'conflict', 'interests', 'drastically', 'differing', 'attitudes', 'towards', 'cohabitation', 'humans', 'Magneto', 'dead', 'X', 'be', 'friends', 'Here', 'see', 'similar', 'opening', 'one', 'witnessed', 'Bryan', 'Singer', '2000', 'film', 'Magneto', 'then', 'known', 'Erik', 'Lehnsherr', 'exhibiting', 'mutant', 'abilities', 'fit', 'rage', 'being', 'separated', 'mother', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'then', 'get', 'small', 'glimpse', 'very', 'different', 'lives', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Erik', 'one', 'very', 'posh', 'privileged', 'upbringing', 'other', 'subjected', 'experimental', 'horrors', 'gifts', 'Now', 'adults', 'come', 'together', 'effort', 'stop', 'evil', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'who', 'deeper', 'connection', 'Erik', 'destroying', 'mankind', 'do', 'gather', 'group', 'mutant', 'teens', 'who', 'are', 'eager', 'harness', 'abilities', 'betterment', 'mankind.As', 'whole', 'graphics', 'are', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'chains', 'water', 'were', 'effectively', 'eerie', 'whole', 'Banshee', 'water', 'scene', 'was', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'pull', 'out', 'great', 'performances', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'McAvoy', 'Fassbender', 'are', 'exciting', 'young', 'leads', 'have', 'already', 'proven', 'terrific', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'actors', 'watch', 'Atonement', 'Fish', 'Tank', 'proof', 'bring', 'polished', 'actorly', 'bravado', 'respective', 'roles', 'here', 'McAvoy', 'way', 'opening', 'charisma', 'charm', 'then', 'effortlessly', 'more', 'mature', 'take', 'character', 'Fassbender', 'chilling', 'unveiling', 'Erik', 'intentions', 'really', 'catch', 'breath.The', 'main', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'sloppy', 'essentially', 'THREE', 'origin', 'stories', 'Xavier', 'Erik', 'X-Men', 'stay', 'grounded', 'back', 'forth', 'so', 'build', 'real', 'solid', 'foundation', 'main', 'stars', 'backstories', 'lazily', 'together', 'actual', 'X-Men', 'team', 'dialog', 'staging', 'teens', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'cheesy', 'forgivable', 'considering', 'superhero', 'movie', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'focused', 'storytelling', 'maybe', 'shafting', 'actual', 'X-Men', 'team', 'vastly', 'less', 'interesting', 'Erik', 'Charles', 'concentrated', 'building', 'powerful', 'story', 'surrounding', 'two', 'comic', 'book', 'heavyweights.Alas', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'action', 'never', 'so', 'plus', ""'m"", 'little', 'confused', 'why', 'decided', 'change', 'origins', 'X-Men', 'team', 'giving', 'Alex', 'Summers', 'starring', 'role', 'when', 'YOUNGER', 'brother', 'Scott', 'Cyclops', 'Summers', 'actual', 'comic', 'books', 'was', 'bit', 'strange', 'new', 'spin', 'franchise', 'so', 'guess', 'OK']",N/A

1414944,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B004LWZW42,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 4]","Here's a knotty problem for a studio to face. What happens when you decide to make a fourth film in one of your biggest franchises, but without any of the three major actors who made the first three films so watchable (particularly when your third movie was a bit of a dog and only saved by their performances)? The decision to make X-Men: First Class as a prequel to the existing movies that was fully open to newcomers was a canny one, allowing 20th Century Fox to effectively reboot the series without throwing away the continuity of the previous films, but the side-effect of losing Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen must have caused some consternation in the office. However, by bringing in director Matthew Vaughn, hot off the acclaimed Kick-Ass, and casting James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the younger Stewart and McKellen, the studio showed some good judgement (which they could have done with on the third movie).First Class is set in 1962, roughly forty years before the events of the existing movie trilogy. Fassbender's Lehnsherr, a survivor of the concentration camps (the memorable first scene of X-Men is cleverly recreated and expanded on in the opening of First Class), is scouring the world for Nazi criminals and in particular Klaus Schmidt, the Nazi scientist who experimented on him to find a use for his mutation. Schmidt turns out to be a mutant himself, now going by the name Sebastian Shaw (a strong performance by Kevin Bacon), who has attracted the enmity of the CIA and their new mutant consultant Charles Xavier (McAvoy) by orchestrating the rising tensions between the USA and USSR. Lehnsherr agrees to join Xavier's team of 'X-Men' to help stop Shaw's plans, but in the process finds himself questioning whether mutants and humans can ever live together peacefully. Caught in the middle is Xavier's adopted shapeshifting sister, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) who is conflicted over whether she wants to be 'normal' or be true to her mutant nature.The inner conflict within the primary characters gives the movie an unusual depth of character for a superhero flick and is true to the themes of tolerance and identity Bryan Singer raised in the first two movies in the series (and handled somewhat more ham-fistedly by Brett Ratner in the third). It also gives us the strongest scene in the movie, as the vengeance-obsessed Lehnsherr confronts two former Nazis in a bar in Argentina in a scene that Tarantino at his best would have been proud of (and the presence of Fassbender speaking German to Nazis in this scene gives viewers of Inglorious Basterds a sense of deja vu). Fassbender's performance throughout is excellent, and he has a great rapport with McAvoy which sells you completely these are the same people as Stewart and McKellen, just younger. That said, the later movies indicated that they were friends and allies for much longer than the few weeks this movie suggests was the case.Elsewhere McAvoy plays the young Charles Xavier to perfection, respecting Stewart's performance but bringing youthful, idealism and a spark of mischief to the character that makes him sympathetic, even when he is appearing to be naive. Scenes where Xavier has to overcome the wearying cynicism of his team-mates are given weight by McAvoy making it clear that Xavier knows that his attempts to forge peace may be doomed, but the attempt must be made anyway. Lawrence's performance is solid, but her conflicted journey is not as handled as well as it could be, with her decision on what side to join not being sold completely successfully (and there are some continuity issues based on her character's behaviour in the first three films, though nothing too bad).The film is well-paced, with a solid use of the old standbys of montages, voice-overs and exposition used to effectively a complicated storyline involving a relatively large cast of characters. A slight failure is the depiction of the bad guys: whilst Bacon's Shaw and January Jone's Emma Frost get plenty of screen-time and dialogue, Riptide and Azazel have little to do and nothing to say, and come across as flat as a result.Elsewhere, the film has effective and impressive action sequences, a rather clever use of real history (though somewhat altered from our own) to enhance the narrative and some nice uses of 1960s imagery and visuals (particularly in the credits sequence). The action sequences are earned by good performances, strong direction and an enjoyable script that is a bit more complex and interesting than many superhero films. There's also a rather cool easter egg for fans of the other movies to watch out for.X-Men: First Class (****) could have been a potential mess, but it emerges as the second-best movie in the franchise

Keep in mind that I am a Marvel geek myself, and have read my fair share of X-books over the years, but I still felt this movie was a muddle, and suffered (greatly!!) from the same affliction as most modern superhero movies: too much exposition and too many major plot points crammed into one, single feature film.Case in point: the ""Beast"" character, introduced here in his original, basically-human guise, proclaiming before the official formation of the X-Men team that a cure for mutanthood needs to be developed, later dosing himself with a prototype vaccine and turning himself into a giant, blue-furred teddybear. Most of this happened in the comics, but over a span of roughly ten years - much later, a mutant vaccine *was* developed and it caused the decimation of the Marvel mutant population. But why put all that into one film, much less a back-to-the-days-of-yore prequel which focusses on the Cuban Missile Crisis as a proving ground for mutants as superheroes? Isn't nuclear annihilation enough? It seems to me that comicbook companies are sitting on a trove of potential scripts, and that they could be more judicious in how they dole them out. Perhaps it would be better *not* to cram all the major concepts of an entire superhero mythology in all at once, but rather set a simple goal -- fight one fight at a time -- and make the scripts more entertaining and less unwieldy and top-heavy.Also, for this particular film, I disliked the mix'n'match approach to the characters they presented, plucking out mutant superdupers from several different phases (and decades) of the X-Men saga and putting them all into a big script-writing Cuisinart, and in many cases (Beast, Angel, Sebastian Shaw, et al) changing the characters themselves so as to make them nearly unrecognizable from their print-media personae. Why? Whywhywhywhywhy?? The Hollywoodization of comicbook fiction continues to be abysmal, which is good in that it encourages old-school comicbook fans like myself to get a life and not take this stuff so seriously, but bad in that it means they are making such lousy films. Oh, well. On a more balanced note, my wife (who is not a big comicbook geek) thought the movie was fine. Hence the two stars, and not one.

At any rate, it just felt that way with me. For that reason, alone, is why I gave the movie three stars.Would I consider it to be 2011's Summer Blockbuster? No. For what it is, X-Men: First Class is a competent comic-book movie that will provide plenty of entertainment to those who watch it, and provide enough for X-Men fans to appease.Given talk that First Class is the first film in a trilogy of new movies, the powers that be(namely Matthew Vaughn) have plenty of time to get things right so I won't complain too bad.

1414959,ALLVXWH9HCW2X,B004LWZW42,Bobo,"[0, 0]","An outstanding effort, what a superb early summer this has been! The characters, effects, and story were all beyond great.  Bryan Singer is back and it clearly showed. Add Vaughn's touch and both display an amazing vision that rivals that of the now classic X2. They manage to keep the story intense and flowing but filled with depth and heart. They also kept an eye on what has come before without being burdened or overly tied to it. If you've never seen any x-film, you'll still love this movie. That said, it builds for another installment and I absolutely can't wait to see it and to see where we go next. The Singer and Vaughn team also manages to deliver a little bit of everything, and I mean EVERYTHING.  There's intrigue, romance, conspiracy, drama, conflict, historical context, retro flavor, fun, humor and of course, kick butt comic book style slugfests.I think this is now the best comic book movie summer ever (even though it's not even officially summer yet) and I'm not exaggerating. 2008 was great but I think we have a new king. Thor was pure greatness and Captain America looks superb. This was the only question mark from Marvel's stable and they absolutely hit it out of the park. Erick and Charles are now given room to thrive and breathe, find their own voice and their own distinctiveness. The plot becomes more intricate as the situations become more dire. Not many adaptations have ever dug as deep as First Class. These are truly some of the most complex characters I've ever seen in a super hero based movie. They're a group of characters who are so well written and full of small, personal moments that they match the best of their rich, four-color origins. They become living, breathing people whom have pasts, presents and futures and I can't wait to see where this new cast takes us from this point forward.I love this youger Xavier and the fact that his youthful flaws are fully on display. Charles is caught up in himself as most people are in their youth.  He is proud and confident young man, and he's ceratinly not the selfless person that we saw in the X-Men trilogy.  I love the fact that the writers were smart enough to convey these elements and show a young man in need of growth. They easily could've made him a ""mini me"" version of Patrick Stewart's Xavier. Instead they went much deeper and the result is much more interesting.  Charles'  relationship with Raven/Mystique is facinating especially when you compare both character to what they will become later. She's an assistant to him and he cares for her, but his ego causes unintended consequences. At times, Charles gives off a condescending, big-brother attitude and that fits so well to the growth the character needs to undertake. You see it in the way he treats the others. In the trilogy, he's exorcised that from his personality. Here, his ego is on a par with Magneto and that makes for an interesting dynamic.Overall, just like X2, I had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie.",5,thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,3010,"['outstanding', 'effort', 'what', 'superb', 'early', 'summer', 'been', 'characters', 'effects', 'story', 'were', 'great', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'back', 'clearly', 'showed', 'Add', 'Vaughn', 'touch', 'display', 'amazing', 'vision', 'now', 'classic', 'X2', 'manage', 'keep', 'story', 'intense', 'flowing', 'filled', 'depth', 'heart', 'also', 'kept', 'eye', 'come', 'being', 'burdened', 'overly', 'tied', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'x-film', ""'ll"", 'still', 'love', 'movie', 'said', 'installment', 'absolutely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'see', 'where', 'go', 'next', 'Singer', 'Vaughn', 'team', 'also', 'deliver', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'mean', 'EVERYTHING', 'intrigue', 'romance', 'conspiracy', 'drama', 'conflict', 'historical', 'context', 'retro', 'flavor', 'fun', 'humor', 'course', 'kick', 'butt', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'slugfests.I', 'think', 'now', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'summer', 'ever', 'even', 'not', 'even', 'officially', 'summer', 'yet', ""'m"", 'not', 'exaggerating', '2008', 'was', 'great', 'think', 'have', 'new', 'king', 'Thor', 'was', 'pure', 'greatness', 'Captain', 'America', 'superb', 'was', 'only', 'question', 'mark', 'Marvel', 'stable', 'absolutely', 'hit', 'park', 'Erick', 'Charles', 'are', 'now', 'given', 'room', 'thrive', 'breathe', 'find', 'own', 'voice', 'own', 'distinctiveness', 'plot', 'more', 'intricate', 'situations', 'become', 'more', 'dire', 'Not', 'many', 'adaptations', 'have', 'ever', 'dug', 'as', 'deep', 'First', 'Class', 'are', 'truly', 'most', 'complex', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'super', 'hero', 'based', 'movie', ""'re"", 'group', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'full', 'small', 'personal', 'moments', 'match', 'best', 'rich', 'four-color', 'origins', 'become', 'living', 'breathing', 'people', 'whom', 'have', 'pasts', 'presents', 'futures', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'where', 'new', 'cast', 'point', 'forward.I', 'love', 'youger', 'Xavier', 'fact', 'youthful', 'flaws', 'are', 'fully', 'display', 'Charles', 'caught', 'up', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'youth', 'proud', 'confident', 'young', 'man', 'ceratinly', 'not', 'selfless', 'person', 'saw', 'X-Men', 'trilogy', 'love', 'fact', 'writers', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'convey', 'elements', 'show', 'young', 'man', 'need', 'growth', 'easily', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'mini', 'version', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Xavier', 'Instead', 'went', 'much', 'deeper', 'result', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Charles', 'relationship', 'Raven/Mystique', 'facinating', 'especially', 'when', 'compare', 'character', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'later', 'assistant', 'ego', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'times', 'Charles', 'off', 'condescending', 'big-brother', 'attitude', 'fits', 'so', 'well', 'growth', 'character', 'undertake', 'see', 'way', 'others', 'trilogy', 'exorcised', 'personality', 'Here', 'ego', 'par', 'Magneto', 'interesting', 'dynamic.Overall', 'just', 'X2', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'movie']",N/A

1414966,A2XZVW9UWKDAMD,B004LWZW42,"Bryan Dewitt Debaron Wolfe ""Wolfman 3:16""","[1, 2]","Comic-book lovers, fans of alternate history, and fantasy-prone moviegoers in general are all sure to find something to love about X-Men: First Class. That rare, elusive fourth chapter that actually manages to pull a failing film series out of a full-on nosedive, X-Men: First Class folds an involving origins story into a dynamic fantasy adventure, and succeeds in delivering both thanks to a strong cast, a tight script, and solid direction.Set in the era before Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr became mortal enemies as Professor X and Magneto, respectively, director Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class follows the two former allies as they lead a powerful team of mutants on a mission to save the planet from nuclear annihilation. Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) were just young men when it began to appear as if the world was careening toward destruction. As the Doomsday Clock ticks faster toward midnight, the time comes to take action. Realizing they could use their unique powers to avert a global thermonuclear war during the Bay of Pigs crisis, the two powerful mutants launch an intense recruitment campaign with the support of Dr. Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) and the CIA. Before long, Charles and Erik have assembled a crack team that includes Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Angel (Zoe Kravitz), Havok (Lucas Till), and Darwin (Edi Gathegi). Meanwhile, the malevolent Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) plots to plunge the world into war with the help of villainous mutants Riptide (Alex Gonzalez), Azazel (Jason Flemyng), and Emma Frost (January Jones). In the process of saving humanity, however, Charles and Erik clash, setting the stage for Professor X to lead the X-Men in the fight for good as Magneto and the Brotherhood spread chaos and destruction on a global scale.It's no secret that comic-book fans can be a fickle bunch. But who can blame them? It seems like every year some Hollywood hotshot makes a misguided attempt at producing a comic-sourced summer tent pole, yet botches the job by thinking they know better than the folks responsible for the source material. In the past decade, even Comic-Con, the massive annual San Diego convention that draws comic geeks from every corner of the globe, has essentially become little more than a free showcase for the latest Hollywood superhero epics. Considering the fact that director Bryan Singer's enthusiastically received X-Men and X2 were followed by a pair of sequels that practically had loyal fans of the comic foaming at the mouth (X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine), it had started to look like the once-successful series had abruptly run out of steam. By looking to the past for inspiration, though, writer/director Matthew Vaughn and co-screenwriters Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, and Jane Goldman managed not only to find a grand-scale origins story that's actually worth telling, but the character dynamics to give the drama genuine impact, as well.The rivalry between Professor X and Magneto has long been a staple of the X-Men series, both on the pages of comic books and in motion pictures. Recognizing that, the creative team behind X-Men: First Class made the wise choice to explore the events that pushed the two former allies to opposite extremes: one devoted to bettering humanity, the other sworn to destroy it. And by filling those roles with talented actors McAvoy and Fassbender, Vaughn and his team ensured that the character drama would pack as big a punch as the action sequences. If the complex relationship between Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr failed to resonate in X-Men: First Class, the film would have been dead in the water. Fortunately, it does, and the energy of that conflict seems to send positive shockwaves through the rest of the production. On the heels of her breakthrough performance in the critically acclaimed Appalachian film noir Winter's Bone, Lawrence brings a deep soulfulness to the character of Mystique as she struggles with the stigma of being ""different,"" and coming off his deliciously sleazy performance in James Gunn's Super, Bacon literally takes power-mad villainy to nuclear extremes.Try as they may, no filmmaker is likely to produce a faithful comic-book adaptation capable of coaxing die-hard fans and casual moviegoers into a human pyramid of mutual adoration, but X-Men: First Class might just come close. Not only because the writers display a certain amount of reverence toward their iconic subjects, but also because the performers are well up to the task, and the action holds consequences that are at once deeply intimate yet potentially devastating for all of humanity.Overall, I give this a FULL PRICE rating!!!!!",5,Magneto Makes a Turtleneck look Bad-Ass!!!!,1326326400,"01 12,

The special effects are superb but it was the acting that comes through for many of the cast members in this film. Michael Fassbender as Magneto offers us the finest performance in the film. Because of the emotional intensity he radiates, he is the glue that holds many scenes together. His part and lines may be a bit elevated over the other characters but Fassbender is pretty intense on screen. James McAvoy is believable as Professor X and Kevin Bacon excels as villain Sebastian Shaw. However it is actress January Jones, who plays Sebastian Shaw's second in command Emma Frost that rounds out the performance since they act in beautiful concert in scene after scene. Jennifer Lawrence as Raven and Nicholas Hoult as Beast also get kudos for jobs well done.

You get to see Mystic, the Beast and a few others as teenagers just learning to control their mutant abilities.

This fifth entry into the X-Men franchise breaks the rule, and very spectacularly.  I had been a bit dubious about a prequel without Patrick Stewart and the familiar younger Xers, but this one is just as good as any of its predecessors and better than some.  It's 1962, and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), age 30, born in England but raised in his wealthy American stepfather's Westchester mansion, has recently earned his doctorate and been named a full professor at an English university, when he's approached by rookie CIA agent Moira McTaggart (Rose Byrne).  Moira has recently observed some incredible things, but what she doesn't know is that they portend the rise of mutants--the next stage in human evolution, speeded up considerably by the use of atomic power, most notably The Bomb--or that Xavier himself, besides being a genius, is also a mutant, a very powerful telepath.  After persuading the Powers That Be that mutants are real, Xavier is given the green light to assemble, under government auspices, a team of them to address the issue of the renegades who seem to be working for the Russians.  It takes everyone a while to realize that they're not working for the Russians at all (though even the Russians think they are): they're working for Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who hopes to destroy ordinary humankind by starting World War III--he seems to believe that mutants will be able to survive fallout--and inaugurate an age of mutant supremacy.  Additionally Shaw is also a mutant--he can absorb any kind of energy and then release it under control of his will--and, under an alias, he worked as a scientist under Nazi auspices (though not a Nazi himself) in a concentration camp where a young Jew named Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) and his parents were imprisoned, and where he killed Erik's mother in an attempt to force Erik to use his own mutant power on command.  Now Erik's grown up and hunting him--and convinced, much as Shaw himself is, that mutants and normals can't possibly coexist; he fears anti-mutant pogroms on a scale not equaled since the Final Solution.  Shaw's plan is elegantly simple: manipulate the US and the USSR into planting missiles close enough to each other's territory that their DEW systems can't warn them of launches, then pressure one side or the other into making the first aggressive move.  The key to this program is Cuba and a ship loaded with Soviet missiles.Of course the SFX in this movie are splendid, and the mutants themselves an intriguing and fascinating collection--Xavier's foster-sister-of-sorts Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), who can assume the shape of any person she wishes but in her own form has dark steel-blue skin patterned with tattoo-like ridges; Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), later The Beast, a scientific genius working for the CIA who has thumbed feet and an athleticism that matches any ape's; Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), who can scream at supersonic frequencies; Havok (Lukas Till), who can release red bolts of destructive energy; Angel (Zoe Kravitz), who has functioning dragonfly wings and can also spit gobs of fire; Emma Frost (January Jons), a powerful telepath who can also transform herself to a diamond-like entity; Azazel (Jason Flemyng), Shaw's good left hand, who (except for his lack of horns) looks rather like the popular conception of the Devil, tail and all, and is a teleport; Riptide (Alex Gonzalez), who can call up whirlwinds; Darwin (Edi Gathegi), who ""adapts to survive"" according to the environment or situation he's in.  (There's even a brief appearance by Wolverine, which those who have seen his movieX-Men Origins: Wolverinewill understand completely.)  The extended climactic faceoff between the American and Soviet fleets over the Russian missile ship is non-stop suspense and excitement, with mutant power being slung in every direction, shells and rockets flying, and a final tragedy that shapes the future of Xavier and his school-that-is-to-be--and of Erik, now known as Magneto.  But almost the best part is the relationship between the two men; Erik seems not to be an evil person at heart--he wants to be Xavier's ""brother"" but can't accept the concept of mutants and normals living side-by-side.  There's a good deal of sf violence, as might be expected, plus one instance of the f-word, some discreet nudity, and one sort-of-sex scene, so it's probably best suited to families with older kids; but it's sure to raise some important discussion points, besides being a superior entry into a popular series and a great action movie that ably stands on its own feet.",5,What *really* happened in

And it is... pretty damn decent.X-Men: First Class centers around a younger Charles Xavier and his new friend, Erik Lehnsherr and their efforts to stop Sebastian Shaw. Shaw has a plan to start a nuclear war so that the radiation will cause more mutations in people. Apparently that's how mutants got their start, which is somewhat confusing since the opening scene (lifted directly from the first X-Men film, a movie which came out, good grief, 11 years ago), shows Erik in 1943, a couple years before nuclear bombs were going off. But never mind. Along the way to stopping Shaw, X picks up several recruits including scientist Hank McCoy, a woman with dragonfly wings, a boy who can scream even louder than the children in my apartment complex (and who looks like an escapee from a Weasly family reunion), and a black guy. Guess what happens to him? Efforts to recruit a cigar smoking Canadian are not as successful.There is an awful lot that I liked about this movie. First James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender do an excellent job playing younger versions of characters made popular by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. Nicholas Hoult also continues to impress, showing that his performance in Skins isn't an aberration. The other members of the cast are also quite good, including Kevin Bacon and January Jones, though I kept seeing her as a naughty Betty Draper more than anything else. The cast is further helped by the fact that Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones and Luc Till are all exceptionally easy on the eyes. There was also some lovely continuity between this movie and the others, though I'm sure some people will bitch about certain errors that crept in.Really the only problems this movie had were that it was a bit longer than it needed to be, and a bit more crowded. We didn't really need all that many mutants up on the screen. Havoc, especially, was adorable but could have been written out without damaging the movie in any way. There were also a couple of very odd edits where it's clear certain scenes were meant to go longer than they did, and instead were just awkwardly chopped. It's also very clear that this is a setup for a new franchise, and while I don't have a huge problem with that, it does cause its own set of problems.That said, it was fun summer escapism. I liked it a bit more than Thor, but it's really apples and oranges with those two. Also, don't bother staying to the end of the credits hoping for a nice Easter egg, cause you won't get one. But stay until the end anyhow, cause the people who make these movies work hard!",4,Very good!,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,2635,"['Well', 'here', 'are', 'number', 'two', 'four', 'big', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'summer', 'pretty', 'decent.X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'centers', 'younger', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'new', 'friend', 'Erik', 'Lehnsherr', 'efforts', 'stop', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'Shaw', 'plan', 'start', 'nuclear', 'war', 'radiation', 'will', 'cause', 'more', 'mutations', 'people', 'Apparently', 'how', 'mutants', 'got', 'start', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'opening', 'scene', 'lifted', 'directly', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'good', 'grief', '11', 'years', 'ago', 'Erik', '1943', 'couple', 'years', 'nuclear', 'bombs', 'were', 'going', 'off', 'never', 'mind', 'way', 'stopping', 'Shaw', 'X', 'up', 'several', 'recruits', 'including', 'scientist', 'Hank', 'McCoy', 'woman', 'dragonfly', 'wings', 'boy', 'who', 'can', 'scream', 'even', 'louder', 'children', 'apartment', 'complex', 'who', 'escapee', 'Weasly', 'family', 'reunion', 'black', 'guy', 'Guess', 'what', 'Efforts', 'recruit', 'cigar', 'smoking', 'Canadian', 'are', 'not', 'successful.There', 'awful', 'lot', 'liked', 'movie', 'First', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'younger', 'versions', 'characters', 'made', 'popular', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'also', 'impress', 'showing', 'performance', 'Skins', ""n't"", 'aberration', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'including', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'January', 'Jones', 'kept', 'seeing', 'naughty', 'Betty', 'Draper', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'cast', 'further', 'helped', 'fact', 'Hoult', 'Caleb', 'Landry', 'Jones', 'Luc', 'Till', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'easy', 'eyes', 'was', 'also', 'lovely', 'continuity', 'movie', 'others', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'bitch', 'certain', 'errors', 'crept', 'in.Really', 'only', 'problems', 'movie', 'had', 'were', 'was', 'bit', 'longer', 'needed', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'crowded', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'many', 'mutants', 'up', 'screen', 'Havoc', 'especially', 'was', 'adorable', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'out', 'damaging', 'movie', 'way', 'were', 'also', 'couple', 'very', 'odd', 'edits', 'where', 'clear', 'certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'meant', 'go', 'longer', 'did', 'instead', 'were', 'just', 'awkwardly', 'chopped', 'also', 'very', 'clear', 'setup', 'new', 'franchise', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'problem', 'cause', 'own', 'set', 'problems.That', 'said', 'was', 'fun', 'summer', 'escapism', 'liked', 'bit', 'more', 'Thor', 'really', 'apples', 'oranges', 'two', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'staying', 'end', 'credits', 'hoping', 'nice', 'Easter', 'egg', 'cause', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'stay', 'end', 'anyhow', 'cause', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'movies', 'work', 'hard']",N/A

1415002,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004LWZW42,C. Sawin,"[307, 356]","The X-Men films are kind of a huge letdown as a whole, aren't they? The first two are pretty good, but everything good they had going for them was completely destroyed once The Last Stand came to fruition. Thank you, Brett Ratner. And X-Men Origins: Wolverine just drove the franchise even further into the ground; kudos, Gavin Hood. So there probably isn't any reason to get excited over a new X-Men film even if it is a prequel to the X-Men films people actually enjoy. Why would we want to see another comic book movie with limitless potential only to drop the ball yet again? Not only does X-Men: First Class take that ball and run with it but it uses it in all the right ways and reminds you why you loved the X-Men in the first place.The cast is way better than it has any right to be. Everyone fits their character incredibly well and works fantastically as a cohesive unit. Kevin Bacon seems like a bit of an odd choice for Sebastian Shaw at first, but any doubt you may have is washed away once you finally see him absorb energy. His role as the main villain may be significantly smaller than you may imagine, but his more than qualified acting chops make nearly every scene he's a part of memorable (nothing really tops his first scene with young Magneto though). James McAvoy does an excellent job handling Charles Xavier. He's gentle, kind, and really seems to care about helping his fellow mutants. Michael Fassbender as Magneto manages to have the strongest on-screen presence. He's intense, powerful, and emotional; the best-rounded character of the film.It was gratifying to see McAvoy and Fassbender make the roles of Professor X and Magneto their own without completely rehashing what Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan established the first time around. That is often a problem when it comes to prequels; these younger actors wind up focusing on mimicking the older version of who they're meant to portray without putting their own spin on it. Luckily, that wasn't an issue here.No expense was made when it comes to the special effects either; Azazel is a perfect example. By the end of the film, you still won't know anything about the character other than the fact that he can teleport like Nightcrawler and is a master swordsman. His teleporting ability is just as fun to watch as Nightcrawler's was in X2 and his fight sequences (especially the one with a particular blue mutant) are always quite engaging. Most of Magneto's scenes involve some pretty hefty CG and it's pulled off rather well. The metal fillings scene is a personal favorite along with the Argentina bar scene (pay particular attention to the slow building yet unnerving music used during that scene along with the weapon used at the table). Then there's the obvious scene of Magneto reversing the missles that's being shown in nearly every advertisement these days. Beast is probably a high point of the special effects. Nicholas Hoult portrays Hank McCoy rather flawlessly (other than one scene that I won't spoil); brainy, shy, not sure of himself, and ashamed of his mutation. Beast's transformation is one of the best scenes in the film though. It gave me flashes of An American Werewolf in London. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of him as Beast because the one good long scene we see of him is really impressive.One of the things that make X-Men: First Class so good is that we get to see how these characters grow into the superheroes and super villains that we know and love today. And again, while the film loosely follows the comics it still manages to blossom and mature into something exceptional on its own while also planting the appropriate seeds to line up with the Bryan Singer X-Men films.So by now you have an idea of how good the film is, but is there anything bad about it? Some characters feel really underdeveloped; Riptide, Darwin, and Angel come to mind, but the biggest disappointment is Havok. There are no connections that he's actually the brother of Cyclops and many will be upset about that. Plus his character doesn't really feel very useful in comparison to both Beast and Banshee who at least put their powers to good use on several occasions throughout the film. Other than a few minor gripes about certain characters, which could surely be rectified in future installments; there really isn't much to complain about with X-Men: First Class.Do not let other 20th Century Fox comic book related films put you off, X-Men: First Class deserves to be held in the highest regard right next to Marvel's best. The cast is practically overflowing with talent, the storyline is both sharp and absorbing, the special effects are probably the best they've ever been in any X-Men film, and the appropriate connections are made to the best parts of the original films. X-Men: First Class should be the standard for all X-Men films from here on out. It's intelligent, engrossing, and spectacular. It's easily the best X-Men film yet.",5,Brilliant; sets the standard for X-Men films,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,4950,"['X-Men', 'films', 'are', 'kind', 'huge', 'letdown', 'whole', 'are', ""n't"",

1415003,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B004LWZW42,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 5]","The super hero genre in movies has been loading up with adaptations from DC and Marvel Comics primarily from the glorious Silver Age of Comics.  In most cases, these incarnations have taken on a stunning visual realism with state of the art technology and pyrotechnics, but what separates the cream of the crop like Spiderman 2 and The Dark Knight from the rest is great acting and a superior script.  Having scored less than impressive results with X Men: Wolverine and Last Stand, the reboot of the franchise, X Men: First Class, is a prequel that reinvigorates with a fresh cast, elaborate script (Ashley Miller and Jack Stentz) and solid direction by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass) who has proven himself in this genre.During World War II, a young boy, Erik, is separated from his parents by ruthless Nazis and tormented by a sadistic doctor, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who forces Erik to unleash his power of magnetism over metal. Meanwhile in a mansion in New York, a young, telepathic Charles Xavier befriends a fellow mutant named Raven who can morph into any person.  Years later in 1962, an adult Erik (Michael Fassbinder) searches the world for Sebastian to exact revenge even as Charles is thriving at Oxford University.  In Las Vegas, CIA agent Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) infiltrates a strip club and spies Sebastian Shaw planning to engineer a Cold War conflict with the Russians.  Sebastian is aided by a roster of evil mutants including Emma Frost (January Jones).  Moira and the CIA seek the help of Xavier who realizes that there are other mutants in the world, and he must seek them out.  As Erik closes on Sebastian, he comes in contact with Charles, now realizing he, too is not alone as a mutant, and joins forces with Charles' growing roster of young mutants including an increasingly restless Raven AKA Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence).  Each discovered mutant has a distinctive power and a unique name or moniker (Charles becomes Professor X and Erik is Magneto). After a deadly attack by Sebastian and his mutants at a CIA compound, Charles and an ever vengeful Erik set about to train their raw recruits to face Sebastian as he steers the Russians on a collision course with the Americans in Cuba.  With a global war imminent, Sebastian reveals a deeper, more insidious plan that could mean the end of humanity.  The action filled climax is a visual feast that has a stunning display of military might versus the mutant super powers and sets the stage for betrayal and realigning allegiances.This is a handsomely mounted production, with visual effects that serve the story and its super mutants in ways that could not be convincingly rendered a generation before.  When a young Erik displays destructive power in front of his Nazi captors, it harkens back to Drew Barrymore's burning apocalypse in Firestarter.  Lending realism to otherwise unworldly characters, the dialogue frequently switches to German, Russian, French and Spanish as the setting dictates, and the fashion styles and news footage lend an air of period authenticity, although trying to integrate events like the Cuban Missile Crisis requires some suspension of disbelief.The film succeeds in portraying the mutants as a metaphor for racial discrimination and being treated as commodities by each respective side of the impending war.  There are moral dilemmas as these kids express feelings and doubts including the question of whether they should accept being different or conform to the human race.  Witness the interesting parallels with the Nazi genocide of World War II, and how Erik ironically assumes some of the corrupt evil from Sebastian, the very individual he hates.This is a very attractive, talented group of actors led by McAvoy (Atonement), sounding like a grown up Harry Potter with a commanding presence and a deliciously charming Fassbender (quite effective in Inglourious Basterds) who is destined to conquer heroic or villainous roles for years to come.  Bacon is featured prominently and has a field day hamming it up as the scheming Sebastian who is clearly modeled after Nazi doctor Josef Mengele.  The scenes as Charles and Erik search for mutants are quite fun, and there are a couple of clever cameos.The film has echoes of traditional James Bond films with its iconic evil characters bent on world domination.  That's not a bad thing.  Whether the box office will garner a direct sequel remains to be seen.  Perhaps the one thing lacking is that it does not engage the audience the way films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Spiderman did.  The same sort of thing plagued the original Lara Croft: Tomb Raider film, only more so.  What comic book enthusiasts will savor is a fairly entertaining recreation of what we know as the X Men, and while things don't perfectly mesh with the original X Men canon, this is a slick, intelligent attempt to rejuvenate a franchise much as J. J. Abrams' Star Trek relaunched that series.",4,X MEN: FIRST CLASS Is a Grand Beginning,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,4943,"['super', 'hero', 'genre', 'movies', 'been', 'loading', 'up', 'adaptations',

Of course you do find out later on, but I don't like to be confused about which character is which. I also didn't like that a 3rd of this movie was subtitles. I hate watching movies where I have to read to understand what's going on. Sometimes the acting was bad, and when one of the members gets killed, the only thing they do is have a line saying ""he just died"" and have watery eyes for a few seconds and move on. Most of the scenes in the beginning moved to fast, looking like if it was trying to be forced in, not sure if I explained it right, but I think what happens at the end and the fight at the end makes up for that. I also thought that Jennifer Lawrence had a lot of cheesy lines in this movie, her character was predictable. I would had also had liked to seen more battle scenes between the main villain and our heros, instead of a battle almost at the end, and most of the effects looked really fake. But I will be seeing the second movie, which sadly won't be released till 2014, due to Lawrence's schedule and because they wanted to revise the script.PlotIn 1944, in Poland, the boy Erik Lehnsherr unleashes his magnetic power when his mother is sent to a concentration camp.

In New York, the wealthy Charles Xavier meets the mutant Raven and invites her to live in his manor. In 1962, the CIA agent Moira MacTaggert discovers the existence of mutants working with Shaw and the invites Professor Xavier to recruit mutants to work for the USA government.

It worked for BATMAN BEGINS; why can't it work for the decidedly campier X-Men?It does, more or less.  The story itself isn't all that interesting: friends Charles and Erik are recruited to train a ragtag group of mutant youths to be super spies for Cold War-era U.S.  (Kudos to director Matthew Vaughen for rooting this film in the sixties; the atmosphere comes off beautifully.)  Things start to go awry when these fledgling superheroes come up against a former Nazi who has a few interesting secrets of his own.The two lead roles are brilliantly cast: James McAvoy, as Charles Xavier, exudes charm and elegance (even when trying to get laid); and Michael Fassbender's Magneto is cool and calculating, with rage boiling just beneath the surface.  As the Nazi doctor, Kevin Bacon is hit-and-miss; his first scene is breathtaking (he projects so much villainous menace, I wanted to go up to the screen and punch him), but as the years progress, his character becomes campier and campier, sporting a horrible hairpiece and a piecemeal accent.  Jennifer Lawrence is great as Mystique; Oliver Platt adds some welcome comedic relief as a government agent; January Jones makes a decidedly wooden Emma Frost; and Nicholas Hoult's Beast is appropriately confused and desperate.  There's also a great cameo from a series mainstay (only half a spoiler; let's face it, you knew it was coming) that pretty much makes the entire film.  (That cameo, plus Kevin Bacon's first scene, are worth the price of admission alone.)The film takes a nice dark turn in the middle, but it never really gets as dark as it should.  Fassbender and McAvoy are ready and willing to go there (hell, in most of his scenes, Fassbender's already there; somebody just give this man an Oscar already, you know he's going to get one eventually), but Vaughn and company hold back, probably to keep with the more light-hearted feel of the Bryan Singer films. It's a disappointing move, but X-MEN: FIRST CLASS still comes out as a great popcorn flick, maybe not quite as entertaining as X-MEN or X-MEN 2, but a mile and a half above the travesties that were X-MEN: LAST STAND and ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.  It's got talented actors hamming it up a bit, which is always worth watching, and a director who knows how to give you equal amounts of action, intrigue, and humor.

It proves Hollywood can make a film that is  exciting, fast paced and incredibly inspiring!

Most of us have a conscience. We all know about cowardice and courage. We have all felt the desire for revenge when someone hurts us deeply. But to simply hide behind, ""I'm only following orders,"" as an excuse to do what is obviously wrong and cowardly is something we should all think about from time-to-time. We never know when we will be in a situation where we should ""disobey orders"" in order not to cooperate with malice or evil. X-Men: First Class tackles this issue head on!

1415015,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B004LWZW42,Dark Faerie Tales,"[1, 1]","The Review:Fresh from the success of last year's phenomenal Kick Ass, Director Matthew Vaughn brings us X-Men: First Class, which is the best X-Men movie to date.  First Class is not just a good comic book movie, but an excellent film. Period. Stars James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender play the young Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr, whom we will come to know as Professor X and Magneto.  First Class is the story of how Magneto and Professor X met and formed the X-Men and how these two friends wind up as enemies.  Rather than being a comic book movie driven by the spandex clad superhero alter egos of the X-Men, First Class is a character driven piece about people with super powers.  It's a subtle, but important distinction. It's no small feat to make a compelling movie centered around characters with cornball names like Magneto.  The writers and directors of First Class have counter-intuitively rejuvenated a series and made it edgier by going backwards to the 1960s, a supposedly simpler time.The success of this superhero film renaissance that began with Spiderman in 2000, and reached new heights with Batman Begins and Ironman in 2005, has come from humanizing superheroes and supervillains.  For example, Magneto is a survivor of the Nazi death camps. He has seen humanity at its very worse and his experience in World War 2 is why he eventually becomes the militant leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants. That he will eventually seek the extinction of humankind is an irony probably not lost on the very cerebral Magneto, vividly brought to life by Michael Fassbender. The key to understanding Magneto is that he doesn't see himself as a villain.  He's fighting for his people in a war. You'll find yourself rooting FOR Magneto. This moral ambiguity has always been present in the X-Men movies more so than any other superhero film franchise. But fear not. That highbrow stuff is the icing on what's also an amazing action blockbuster.First Class presents a scenario in which flying men, telepaths and shape shifters seem perfectly natural within the setting of the coldest parts of the Cold War.  It's a testament to the creative team and the film's stars that they were able to put such a realistic edge on a completely fantastic premise.  McAvoy and Fassbender are filling the shoes of Patrick Stewart and Ian McClellan, two heavy hitters of stage and screen, and they do so with great skill.  These younger incarnations of Professor X and Magneto have the added advantage of being able handle a lot more action than their older predecessors.  It's a good thing too because the villainous Sebastian Shaw is more powerful than all the X-Men put together and unlike Magneto, there is no moral ambiguity with Sebastian Shaw, played pitch perfect by Kevin Bacon. Shaw is a cold blooded murderer and he has genocide on his mind. There is almost as much superhero action in this X-Men movie than in the entirety of the first three films. That the film makers could also include Schindler's List and Munich levels of pathos ups the ante for the superhero movie genre.

Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","The X-Men is the most popular and successful superhero team to come from Marvel comics and with the loose adaptation of the films, there has been discussion of taking the story of the history and beginning of the X-Men from the early beginning.But one of the problems is that the original team was founded in 1963 and while comic books do a great job of elongating the superheroes life throughout the comic book series with no signs of real-time aging, the movies can not.  Therefore, part of the task of producer Lauren Shuler Donner and Bryan Singer was to create a new beginning for the film version, incorporate characters that were not introduced in the film trilogy but to make sure the storyline focuses on the relationship of Professor Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto).Bryan Singer who was responsible for the first two X-Men films worked on the storyline for ""X-Men: First Class"" but to hone the story and make it his own was director Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"", ""Stardust"", ""Snatch"") who was given a second chance to work on an X-Men film after departing ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (due to family obligations and also a perfectionist who does not like to be rushed, in which ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" had a rushed schedule).So, Matthew Vaughn and his team began crafting ""X-Men: First Class"" and despite the differences from the comic book series, fans enjoyed the more violent and action-driven tone of the film with a strong script, focused direction and wonderful performances from its cast.  And the film was successful in the box office making over $350 million dollars and has received positive reviews from film critics worldwide.VIDEO:""X-Men: First Class"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1) and the picture quality of this film is fantastic.  There is a good balance of warm and cool colors but the amount of detail for the characters was fantastic.  Good balance between vibrant colors, ambers, blues and black levels were nice and deep. I detected no crush, no artifacts, no banding.  The film looks great on Blu-ray!Especially the various color combinations used in the film from the blues on Mystique and Beast (and I just have to add that Matthew Vaughn's input on the Beast was right on the money!), the look of Azazel was fantastic, the detail on the wings of Angel was quite impressive and the scenes with the White Queen especially the wide-angle shot of her walking to the Russians is a pretty cool shot!Jon Mathieson (""Gladiator"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"", ""Hannibal"") is an awesome cinematographer and when it comes to bringing in breathtaking shots to an action film, from his work on ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"", he definitely brought memorable scenes to ""X-Men: First Class"".  The whole look and feel of the film was stylish and cool, editing was well-done and the overall direction of the characters was quite smooth and fluid. The action sequences and the use of CG for the film was wisely done and if anything, it was a great balance of a great script and action sequences that looked great for the film.It's one thing to have the details of Mystique, Beast, Angel, Azazel looking very good but there was good choice of colors and just overall well-planned scenes that made the film look fantastic, stylish and very cool!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""X-Men: First Class"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, 5.1 Dolby Digital Descriptive Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.I can easily say that if you are an audiophile, you are going to love this film!  Center and front channels are crystal clear but the amount of LFE and the immersive lossless soundtrack is just fantastic.  There are three major scenes where the lossless audio is quite stellar.  From the first encounter of Charles Xavier and Erik in the ocean, as you can hear metal being squeezed and Riptide unleashing his twisters towards the US military, another scene features Sebastian Shaw and his team attacking the area where the mutants are being kept and hearing Azazel going dropping bodies from the air and the bodies hitting the pavement to the attacks.  This action sequence lasts a long while and is pretty intense with a lot of gun shots, windows shattering, explosions galore.  And of course, the final battle sequence which takes up the final half hour is fantastic.The music composed by Henry Jackman (""The Dark Knight"", ""Pirates of the Carribean"" films) was also awesome and I'm glad that FOX included the isolated score as a feature on the Blu-ray release!I was very pleased by this soundtrack and there was one point which my wife was walking into the living room and there was one startling scene that freaked her out as she was near the right surround speaker.  Needless to say, I was enjoying the lossless soundtrack and yes, part of me was hoping it would be in 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio but for the most part, it was a pretty awesome soundtrack that I am confident will win over the audiophiles!Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""X-Men: First Class"" comes with the following special features:X-Marks the Spot -( 19:55) You can watch the following featurettes while watching the film or individually.

I'm a critical X-Man fan.I have had issues of ""The Uncanny X-Men"" from the '60s to the present, I have purchased nearly every X-Men related title and mini-series since the '80s, the Toy Biz toys from the '90s, the Marvel Legends action figures from the early 2000's and even the movie figures from the first two ""X-Men"" films.With that being said, I also know that film adaptations from the comics are not going to be 100% but I know when a film seemed rushed and when the characters don't seem right.  With that being said, I will say that I enjoyed the second ""X-Men"" film and understood the introductions to the characters of the first film.  But since then, the third film and the Wolverine film were popcorn action films that didn't have the best screenplay.  Yes, it delivered in action but since the release of ""The Dark Knight"", the rules of comic book-inspired films have changed my attitude towards these films.  I would rather have a well-written screenplay, a film done right versus a film that features action, explosions and are literally films that make me want to watch only because the characters are X-Men but not for the overall story.I felt the second X-Men film (The Last Stand) was the best in making a serious X-Men film which included a darker story and violence but since then, the X-related films have backed away from a strong script.So, I give Twentieth Century Fox and producer Lauren Shuler Donner in giving Matthew Vaughn a second chance.  The fact is that the third film was rushed, he knew it was rushed and he backed away from it.  But this time around, although production schedule was still tight, he brought his creative team aboard and made sure that he had control over the film and the producers gave him that control, including producer/writer Bryan Singer when it came to make those changes with the story.  It was a collaborative effort but when done right by a person who was intent of making and creating a more serious, more violent type of film, he was able to accomplish it with great efficacy.After the film was released in theaters, my friends and associates were calling me up and raving about the film.  How it was the best ""X-Men"" film to date and after watching ""X-Men: First Class"", I agree.Granted, the X-Men fan in me still has a hard time of seeing Havok and the White Queen in the beginning storyline but how these characters were incorporated to the film, it made sense.  Having Mystique and Azazel in the film definitely scores brownie points for X-Men fans as the storyline of Nightcrawler (featured in second X-Men film), going with a somewhat unknown group was wise but to have a balance of talent by bringing in accomplished actors such as James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Kevin Bacon was a fantastic choice by casting and Michael Vaughn.Many of these talents are known for their serious acting work on non-action films and by bringing McAvoy and Fassbender, I was a bit skeptical at first on the chemistry of the two characters but after watching the film, I was quite pleased.  I also have to give Michael Vaughn a thumbs up by using the 1960's Jamese Bond (Sean Connery) films as a source of inspiration for the look of the film, especially for Erik's costume design and of course, the look and feel of everyone else, especially January Jones ala Emma Frost.  She looked fantastic!The Blu-ray release of ""X-Men: First Class"" is wonderful when it comes to picture and lossless audio quality and the disc is packed with special features and extras.  Granted, if going by the Twentieth Century Fox X-Men releases, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a 1.5 release when the next film is released.Granted, the next film coming out will be another Wolverine film but if only Matthew Vaughn and his team can work on every X-Men related film, if he was able to bring this much quality to the screenplay and overall direction, he does a fantastic job.  The only thing I can think of, that would make things much worthwhile is possibly giving filmmaker Joss Whedon a chance one of these days as he had done a pretty solid job on the comic book series and knows the fine balance between movies and the comic series.But overall, I was quite pleased with ""X-Men: First Class"" and I share the same sentiment as others that this is the best X-men film to date.  Put the film in capable hands, especially to a perfectionist and sure enough, Matthew Vaughn and his team did a wonderful job in putting synergy to the X-Men films and I can't wait for more (especially if Vaughn and team returns).""X-Men: First Class - 2-Disc Set"" is a wonderful release and is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray (4.5 stars): ""X-Men: First Class"" is the best X-Men film to

How gifted actors with serious thespian chops the likes of Kevin Bacon, James McAvoy, and Michael Fassbender would tolerate being a part of this belly wobbler is beyond me; here's hoping some agents received much-deserved pink slips as a result.  Set during the Cold War/Cuban Missile Crisis of the early Sixties, X-MEN:  FIRST CLASS is the story of how the various mutants came together under two alliances--the Cold War covert operatives, and the greedy gold diggers bent on world domination.  And. . .of course. . .once all the mutants are in one spot flaunting their super genes against one another, the capitalists and commies take advantage by mutually launching missiles to destroy these ""monsters"".  And--voila!--the table is set for all the succeeding X-MEN adventures in the franchise.Yawn.Are the special effects terrific?  Absolutely.  Are Rose Byrne, January Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, and Zoe Isabella Kravitz sweet-tooth eye candy?  Is the Pope Catholic?

From Magneto to Sebastian to Riptide to Azazel, there is some serious arrogance going down; this offering is an unabashed Haughtiness Fest (and a very lousy one at that).  No doubt fans of the franchise appreciate this prequel, and I get that; I'm just judging X-MEN:  FIRST CLASS as an Average Joe viewer with no preconceived notions, biases, or prejudices.

As an added dimension to the relationship between Xavier and Magnus, it's brilliant - multi-layered and revealing. Nearly every word shared by the two in this picture works to enhance their antagonistic rapport in the Stewart-McKellen films, improving upon an already-solid backbone. This chapter is also surprisingly even-handed and honest, presenting a scenario where neither man is truly in the right nor the wrong. It's that tantalizing balance that's the key to the characters' relationship in the comics, and it's never been presented more efficiently. The Cold War motif that surrounds the two serves initially as an ideal backdrop to their budding kinship, but eventually proves too ambitious for its own good. By the time the big climax rolls around, the story has basically painted itself into a corner and the conclusion, as a result, feels hurried and insubstantial.

And there's a noticeable lack of dignified old men like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen.Yes, this is not the X-Men you're used to. ""X-Men: First Class"" goes back to the 1960s to tell the origin stories of both the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, as well as their charismatic leaders Professor X and Magneto. The story itself is a puff piece used to introduce the characters, but the performances by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are absolutely spellbinding.In the 1960s, a CIA sting operation discovers that the the cruel Sebastien Shaw (Kevin Bacon) (who is working with the Russians) also has a small group of superpowered mutants who can teleport, read minds, and so on. And the existence of mutants is proven to the government by mind-reading telepath Charles Xavier (McAvoy) and his foster sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence).With Shaw planning to spark off a nuclear war between Russia and the US, Xavier begins gathering his own group of mutants -- including Erik Lensherr, a Holocaust survivor who is hell-bent on killing Shaw. The mutants begin training themselves so they can use their abilities to the fullest, but they may not be a match for Shaw... and even worse, Erik might be.""X-Men: First Class"" as a pretty fluffy main plot, since its main purpose is to bring Erik and Charles together as best buddies... only to have them splinter off in two very different directions. Yes, there's a lot of stuff about the Cuban missile crisis and impending nuclear doom, but it feels like it's just a backdrop for the REAL drama.But it is a pretty fun popcorn movie, though not as powerful as the first two X-Men movies. There are some very striking moments (the FLYING SUBMARINE! Epic!), and some pretty impressive action scenes. However, director Matthew Vaughn really underplays some important scenes (such as Beast's transformation), and he really beats you over the head with the gay parallels of the mutants (""You didn't ask"").As for the cast, the villains are pretty lackluster. Bacon gives a good performance, but he feels strangely out of place, as if he doesn't quite click into the story. And January Jones -- aka ""sparkly Christmas ornament with breasts"" -- gives a performance like garden tools scraping through a chalkboard. She is so annoying that she actually infects any scene she's in.But on the flipside, the protagonists are AMAZING. McAvoy and Fassbender are absolutely brilliant as two very similar men -- charismatic, intelligent, strong-willed -- who become fast friends, but are divided by their different views of human nature. Both actors really explore the bond between their characters, but you can see their differing beliefs slowly infecting it.As for the younger X-Men, they range from excellent (the adorable Nicholas Hoult) to horribly flat (Zo Kravitz), but the one that disappointed me the most was Lawrence as the young Mystique. She's not bad, but she doesn't show the conflicted feelings and pain that she needed to.""X-Men: First Class"" has a rather lightweight plot and some sketchy casting, but is saved by the presence of McAvoy and Fassbender.

1415051,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004LWZW42,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","For someone who is not an avid fan of the comic book movie genre, I think this prequel to the ""X-Men"" series is well done and doesn't require as much of a crash course as I was expecting to understand the set-up. That's because director Matthew Vaughn has chosen to focus heavily on character development rather than just elaborate special effects to make this historical 2011 fantasy adventure truly arresting. He and producer Bryan Singer were also smart to gather a first-rate cast of young actors who lend atypical gravity to the proceedings and cumulatively, they provide the narrative throughput necessary to show how the characters evolve into their more familiar older personas.  Having only seen theX-Men Origins: Wolverineentry, I am no ""X-Men"" follower, so it was helpful to get the back stories for Magneto and Xavier in dramatically economic order. The story begins chronologically in 1944 when a young German boy named Erik Lensherr watches his parents being hauled off to Auschwitz.In a fit of fear and rage, Lensherr bends the metal gate separating him from his family, commanding the attention of scientist Dr. Klaus Schmidt, who is eager to harness the young boy's telekinetic powers. Meanwhile, at a mansion in Westchester County, New York, young telepath Charles Xavier meets homeless young shape-shifter Raven. They bond over their unique powers. Flash forward to 1962, and the grown Erik contemplates his revenge against the man who went on to ruin his life. Schmidt has since changed his name to Sebastian Shaw and heads up a secret society out to take over the world. Xavier and Raven are still together as foster siblings as he earns his doctorate in genetic research at Oxford. Ultimately, Xavier's and Lensherr's destinies become intertwined with the Cuban Missile Crisis, a pivotal opportunity for Shaw to use the full scope of his energy-absorbing mutant powers. Xavier is recruited by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert to help her agency stop Shaw. Xavier brings Lensherr to the CIA's secret ""Division X"" facility where they find and recruit mutants for training to stop Shaw. The young mutants end up dividing their loyalties, and the nonstop action ultimately culminates into Shaw's Machiavellian attempts to trigger World War III in the midst of the Soviet movement to arm Cuba with nuclear missiles.The military showdown provides the context for the separate fates of Xavier and Lensherr, which obviously leads to the formation of the X-Men as they are known in the original series. While James McAvoy (Atonement) is effective as Xavier, even evoking some of Patrick Stewart's erudite manner at times, the film is dominated by Michael Fassbender's (Inglourious Basterds) laser-sharp intensity as Xavier. A cast-against-type Kevin Bacon has a field day as Schmidt/Shaw to the point where he approaches self-parody. In a nice twist from her role as the spoiled socialite wife inBridesmaids, Rose Byrne brings a nice, no-nonsense proto-feminist sense to MacTaggert. The others, including Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) as Raven, acquit themselves nicely in their roles. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the movie works as matinee-level entertainment for the rest of us. The 2011 Blu-Ray contains a hefty number of extras although surprisingly no commentary track. There are twenty minutes of behind-the-scenes clips, fifteen minutes of extended and deleted scenes, an hour-plus making-of documentary, and various interactive features.",4,Before They Were X-Men...a Welcome Focus on Character and an Arresting Turn by Fassbender,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,3469,"['someone', 'who', 'not', 'avid', 'fan', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'genre', 'think', 'prequel', 'X-Men', 'series', 'well', 'done', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'crash', 'course', 'was', 'expecting', 'understand', 'set-up', 'director', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'chosen', 'focus', 'heavily', 'character', 'development', 'rather', 'just', 'elaborate', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'historical', '2011', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'truly', 'arresting', 'producer', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'were', 'also', 'smart', 'gather', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'lend', 'atypical', 'gravity', 'proceedings', 'cumulatively', 'provide', 'narrative', 'throughput', 'necessary', 'show', 'how', 'characters', 'evolve', 'more', 'familiar', 'older', 'personas', 'Having', 'only', 'seen', 'theX-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverineentry', 'am', 'X-Men', 'follower', 'was', 'helpful', 'get', 'back', 'stories', 'Magneto', 'Xavier', 'dramatically', 'economic', 'order', 'story', 'chronologically', '1944', 'when', 'young', 'German', 'boy', 'named', 'Erik', 'Lensherr', 'parents', 'being', 'hauled', 'off', 'Auschwitz.In', 'fit', 'fear', 'rage', 'Lensherr', 'metal', 'gate', 'separating', 'family', 'commanding', 'attention', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Klaus', 'Schmidt', 'who', 'eager', 'harness', 'young', 'boy', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'Meanwhile', 'mansion', 'Westchester', 'County', 'New', 'York', 'young', 'telepath', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'homeless', 'young', 'shape-shifter', 'Raven', 'bond', 'unique', 'powers', 'Flash', 'forward', '1962', 'grown', 'Erik', 'revenge', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'ruin', 'life', 'Schmidt', 'changed', 'name', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'up', 'secret', 'society', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'Xavier', 'Raven', 'are', 'still', 'together', 'foster', 'siblings', 'doctorate', 'genetic', 'research', 'Oxford', 'Ultimately', 'Xavier', 'Lensherr', 'destinies', 'become', 'intertwined', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'pivotal', 'opportunity', 'Shaw', 'use', 'full', 'scope', 'energy-absorbing', 'mutant', 'powers', 'Xavier', 'recruited', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Moira', 'MacTaggert', 'help', 'agency', 'stop', 'Shaw', 'Xavier', 'brings', 'Lensherr', 'CIA', 'secret', 'Division', 'X', 'facility', 'where', 'find', 'recruit', 'mutants', 'training', 'stop', 'Shaw', 'young', 'mutants', 'end', 'up', 'dividing', 'loyalties', 'nonstop', 'action', 'ultimately', 'Shaw', 'Machiavellian', 'attempts', 'trigger', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'midst', 'Soviet', 'movement', 'arm', 'Cuba', 'nuclear', 'missiles.The', 'military', 'showdown', 'context', 'separate', 'fates', 'Xavier', 'Lensherr', 'obviously', 'formation', 'X-Men', 'are', 'known', 'original', 'series', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Atonement', 'effective', 'Xavier', 'even', 'evoking', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'erudite', 'manner', 'times', 'film', 'dominated', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Inglourious', 'Basterds', 'laser-sharp', 'intensity', 'Xavier', 'cast-against-type', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'field', 'day', 'Schmidt/Shaw', 'point', 'where', 'self-parody', 'nice', 'twist', 'role', 'spoiled', 'socialite', 'wife', 'inBridesmaids', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'nice', 'no-nonsense', 'proto-feminist', 'sense', 'MacTaggert', 'others', 'including', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'Raven', 'acquit', 'nicely', 'roles', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'series', 'movie', 'matinee-level', 'entertainment', 'rest', '2011', 'Blu-Ray', 'hefty', 'number', 'extras', 'surprisingly', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'clips', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'hour-plus', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'various', 'interactive', 'features']",N/A

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","X MEN: 1ST CLASS I suppose could be considered a 1st class film, in that the acting, art direction and special effects are quite smashing. Also, I have to admit that this better-than-soap-opera approach and the very subtle humor kept me watching.This film is of course the inevitable prequel, purporting to tell us all about how Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) met Eric-the-magnet (Michael Fassbender who stars in way too many comic-book movies), blah blah blah. It is a colorless, unimaginative tale frankly, with Kevin Bacon starring as an evil Nazi in Eric's past, and this smacked WAY too much of Wolverine's past.Even worse is James McAvoy, a man I find physically attractive, a good enough actor, always game for action foolishness. It's difficult to say if the studios are misusing him or what, but he almost always seems to be woefully miscast. That, and the fact that Gerard Butler could be his father for all that MacAvoy looks exactly like Butler did back in the late 1980s.Everyone here (including another rotten injustice to Oliver Platt who is credited as ""man in the black suit"") is a cardboard cutout for the action. This had too many great, talented people for them to be shoved into the background like that. I always say, that is the director's fault. Yet they all kept their talents and dignity more or less intact, the story kept me remotely interested so I saw it through.Nicholas Hoult (Beast), a stunning favorite of mine for a good while now, is reduced to a joke after a good start early in the film. See my glowing reviews of him for his work inClash of the Titans (2010)andA Single Man (2009). I hear he may be playing Mad Max soon!I do have to say one major thing out of the goofs here: why did Fassbender start with an American accent, suddenly get a British accent in the 2nd act, and end the thing with an Irish accent?I thought it was 3 different actors doing his voice-overs!All in all it was semi-fun, it was quasi-interesting (I'm no fan of anything X Men anyway), and everything else I already said.

1415058,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B004LWZW42,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","I actually found the first two X-Men movies to be surprisingly enjoyable. Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Ian McKellan brought a real emotional energy to those movies. They had short, action-packed stories that weren't suffocated with fight scenes.Unfortunately, X-Men: First Class is underwhelming when compared to its predecessors. Aside from Professor Xavier and Magneto and Mystique, all of the characters are eminently forgettable. I know the film is about the beginning of the X-Men, but the younger mutants act like a bunch of rambunctious teenagers. Each student learns a ""lesson"" in growing and using his/her powers, but it way too much of a Hollywood cliche. None of the younger characters ever really sticks out or learns any lesson more valuable than ""trust in yourself."" At other times, I thought the sexual tension was amped way too much up without any sexual chemistry, particularly Mystique's throwing herself on every available guy.The plot centers around the X-Men trying to save the world during the Cuban Missile Crisis. At times, this went a bit too far and required too much suspension of disbelief. The movie makes it appear everything during the crisis was orchestrated by mutants. On an emotional level, none of the characters were ever truly threatened or put through emotional duress (with the exception of Xavier and Magneto, although during events not related to the Missile Crisis plot).One final complaint I had about the movie was the special effects. They were surprisingly boring. Nothing visually interesting. Even worse, Beast looked CGI and unconvincing. I really liked how they did Beast in X-Men 3, using makeup and real people. The CG Beast looks cartoonish by contrast.The one saving grace of the film is the dynamic between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Professor X and Magneto, respectively. Alone, neither actor shines in this film (although I love other work they've done), but together they work magic. Their relationship creates real depth to the characters and sheds new light on the earlier films.Overall, this is X-Men geared towards the modern teen audience. If you didn't like the previous X-Men movies, there's even less to like here. If you want to learn more about the X-Men characters, there's not much except for Magneto and Xavier - although those two have some admittedly great moments.Overall, 2.5 stars - worth watching as an action flick, but also a sign that the X-Men franchise might need to take a break.",3,"too much, yet too little",1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,2481,"['actually', 'found', 'first', 'two', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'brought', 'real', 'emotional', 'energy', 'movies', 'had', 'short', 'action-packed', 'stories', 'were', ""n't"", 'suffocated', 'fight', 'scenes.Unfortunately', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'underwhelming', 'when', 'compared', 'predecessors', 'Aside', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'Mystique', 'characters', 'are', 'eminently', 'forgettable', 'know', 'film', 'beginning', 'X-Men', 'younger', 'mutants', 'act', 'bunch', 'rambunctious', 'teenagers', 'student', 'lesson', 'growing', 'using', 'his/her', 'powers', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'cliche', 'None', 'younger', 'characters', 'ever', 'really', 'out', 'lesson', 'more', 'valuable', 'trust', 'other', 'times', 'thought', 'sexual', 'tension', 'was', 'amped', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'particularly', 'Mystique', 'throwing', 'available', 'guy.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'X-Men', 'trying', 'save', 'world', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'times', 'went', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'required', 'too', 'much', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'appear', 'everything', 'crisis', 'was', 'orchestrated', 'mutants', 'emotional', 'level', 'none', 'characters', 'were', 'ever', 'truly', 'threatened', 'put', 'emotional', 'duress', 'exception', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'events', 'not', 'related', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'plot', 'final', 'complaint', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'boring', 'Nothing', 'visually', 'interesting', 'Even', 'worse', 'Beast', 'looked', 'CGI', 'unconvincing', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'did', 'Beast', 'X-Men', '3', 'using', 'makeup', 'real', 'people', 'CG', 'Beast', 'cartoonish', 'contrast.The', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'dynamic', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Professor', 'X', 'Magneto', 'respectively', 'Alone', 'actor', 'film', 'love', 'other', 'work', ""'ve"", 'done', 'together', 'work', 'magic', 'relationship', 'real', 'depth', 'characters', 'new', 'light', 'earlier', 'films.Overall', 'X-Men', 'geared', 'modern', 'teen', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'previous', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'even', 'less', 'like', 'here', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'X-Men', 'characters', 'not', 'much', 'Magneto', 'Xavier', 'two', 'have', 'admittedly', 'great', 'moments.Overall', '2.5', 'stars', 'worth', 'watching', 'action', 'flick', 'also', 'sign', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'might', 'need', 'take', 'break']",N/A

Someone took charge of X-Men First Class and made it into what the other movies should have been...  stronger acting (mostly by Kevin Bacon, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender) and better dialog made X-Men First Class stand out as did the emotional depth of a  few of the characters (the poignancy of the Magneto character was really very moving).Though it's still not as good as the newer Batman movies with Christian Bale (The Dark Knight was fantastic - a 5 star movie easily), it deserves a look, praise and 4.5 stars!p.s.

1415070,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B004LWZW42,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[13, 19]","I am now screwed in my movie-watching for the rest of the year because I'll be so hard-pressed to find something that doesn't make me say, ""It was good, but it was no X-Men: First Class."" I will go to comedies, but doubt I will erupt into applause again at the perfect execution of a joke so satisfying. I will go to action films, but I doubt they will use their explosions and action so effectively. I can go to horror films, but I doubt I will feel somebody die as much as I did in this movie. I can go to romantic films, but I doubt any will be as heartbreaking as this. I can go to dramas, but I doubt I will care for characters quite like I did with this film.Point is, X-Men is not only the best superhero film in my opinion, but a fantastic film in its own right, so much so that it has the ability to make other works seem amateurish. The previous X-Men trilogy? I'm currently in the process of erasing it from my memory. I cared more for characters that were on the screen for less than 5 minutes than I did for 95% of the original trilogy's characters. Thinking about characters like Rogue, or the fates of several of the characters in The Last Stand actively make me angry now when I think of them in context of this film.First off, a lot of credit goes to director Matthew Vaughn, who in my opinion is one of my top 3 directors working today. The guy simply operates at a level above everybody else in this film, and the things that he does with the camera, the way he makes you feel, and the way he does everything is just a wonder. Prequel films and origin stories are typically one of the hardest things to do in film, see X-Men Origins: Wolverine for proof, but Vaughn makes it look easy, possibly earning the distinction of being the best stand-alone prequel film of all time. The things you expect in a superhero origin story are all here: Training sequences, learning to use powers, discovering powers, coming to grips with those powers, and having responsibility of them are all touched upon here, and are all handled exquisitely.For the first two films, X-Men was certainly a grand allegory for both racism and homophobia, but here it's just elevated to a whole other level, and is truly relevant to these times. The Professor X/Magneto and MLK/Malcolm X comparisons are more valid than ever here, as both the men's true beliefs are explored to its fullest rather than the more implied 'Oh, well, he was in a concentration camp. That's why he's like this.' Here Vaughn includes the original trilogy scene of Magneto at the camp, but then continues after that and follows Magneto in events after that. The result is you completely understand the reasons of both men for what they do, and when Magneto does what he does as an adult, you feel his pain and the god-like fury raining down from him as he goes about the world bringing about vengeance.Which brings me to the action. The budget here was reportedly $120 million, which is less than most big budget movies nowadays, especially something like Pirates 4 or even Spider-Man 3 whose budgets can almost reach $250 million. Those films have nothing on this one. The acts of action are simple. The uses of the powers are usually simple. But you feel them all, and are usually stunned by them. You might have seen some amazing things in the trailer, but until you've seen them in the movie, and the context for them, you haven't really seen them. The lifting of a submarine for instance is a triumphant occasion, an amazing feat, and something that you're rooting for, even though it's performed by Magneto, who you know is not a nice guy in later films. It's not exactly a type of action I would describe as ""fun,"" but rather immensely satisfying.I should also say that even though it's PG-13, you should consider this to be something on the level of The Dark Knight in terms of maturity. There's no character quite like the Joker of course, but what the film does with a simple coin is one of the most dark, violent, stunning and frankly, emotionally powerful I've seen in a while. That scene is also a testament to Vaughn's work, who takes something that probably seemed rather simple in the script, but with the use of camera angle, cuts, and the pace of it, you feel every moment of it, and it's disturbing. Then there's the whole Mystique kind of being naked, but not really since she's scaly and blue, and it's never been creepier to me than here when they show the Mystique form in her as a child. Then there's also it's clear use of the F-Word, which is, like the rest of the movie, effective.The acting is of course wonderful, as everybody hits all the right beats they need to with their characters. Frankly, they're so good that they make it look easy, which means you probably won't realize how good they actually are. A lot of people have cited how bad January Jones is in the movie, but I simply didn't see it. She is what she needs to be, and that's fine with me. McAvoy has never been better, the young talents are a revelation, Bacon is sinister as heck, and Fassbender is just something else. Then there's the gaggle of character actors, all of whom have played main villains in their own movies and shows at some point, simply populating the movie and adding more class to it. Seriously, this is a classy film. Also, ""M. Ironside.""Overall, I loved this fiilm. It left me and my mind in a constant state of being blown away,  and it consistently gets better as it goes along until the tour de force finale. Its themes are heavy, its acting is fantastic, its characters are wonderful, its action is stunning, and its emotion is palpable. I cannot recommend this film highly enough, and if they do make a sequal to this, it kind of has to have Vaughn at the helm again simply for the fact that I don't know if topping this film is possible. Also, go to Rotten Tomatoes and take note of every critic who gave this a negative review, and give them a grain of salt for the rest of their careers. As it stands now, I am convinced that everybody who is giving this a negative review either came in not wanting to like it, didn't pay attention to it, understand it, or even seen it. Don't you make their same mistakes. I am pretty sure you'll come out of the movie liking it if you give it the slightest chance.Note: There is no scene after the credits. Once the credits start rolling, the movie is over. If you simply sit in the theater assuming that there will be a scene after the credits, you will be sorely dissapointed, you might curse at the movie, and I will laugh hysterically at you.",5,A

I liked the first two X-men and I even (I know I know) kind of liked the third one. But the Wolverine movie was just awful....and by awful I mean the worst Marvel movie I've seen. The origins movie I was looking forward to the most was the rumored Magneto movie. Then I heard that one was being canned for some stupid X-Men movie called First Class *yawn*. Then I had to suffer through the 2 Iron Man movies. Norton's version of the Hulk wasn't bad and Thor was actually pretty good (I know the avengers movies are from a different studio yes yes).Anyways...I didn't have high hopes for this film. So when I went to the movies I went in expecting this wasn't going to be much. Man was I wrong. James McAvoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender(Magneto), Kevin Bacon (Shaw), Jennifer Lawrence (Raven/Mystique), January Jones (Frost), and Nicholaus Hoult (Beast) all played amazing parts and their acting was near perfection.Basically the story is about the coming of age of two very strong Mutants, Xavier and Magneto. Magneto's story starts off in the nazi concentration camps as a tortured young Jew where one of the officers (Shaw) discovers his abilities and takes him in to use him as his own personal weapon. Xavier lives an upper class life where he befriends a shapeshifting young girl (Mystique) and they grow up together much like brother and sister. Their paths cross years later in early adulthood where Xavier and Raven/Mystique are helping the CIA track and take down Shaw for trying to start World War 3 and Magneto is trying to get revenge on Shaw for murdering his family and torturing him for many years. Xavier and Magneto end up working together, recruiting other mutants, and trying to stop world war 3 before it starts.Do yourselves a favor. If you have lost faith in the X-men movies go watch this.

1415072,AUNXMAVLNC9P7,B004LWZW42,Four Gee Sixty Three,"[7, 17]","The actual film is fantastic, saw it in theaters, thought it was a great prequel to the original trilogy. The reason for my 1 star rating is for the actual Blu-Ray disc. Mine has a noticeable ""lag"" in the playback of both the feature film AND the special features. So I got online onto both Screen Rant and X-Men Movies' facebook fan pages, and found that others are experiencing the same issue. I am returning this copy to Wal-Mart for the single disc Blu-Ray without the digital copy disc to see if that one is any better. If not, then I guess i'm just stuck with a movie I cannot enjoy.**UPDATE** 9/15/2011I went back to Wal-Mart and exchanged the 2-disc Blu-Ray set for the single disc Blu-Ray and experienced the exact same playback issues. I have since returned that copy as well for store credit and bought Thor on Blu-Ray instead. I have since read that some guy figured out that when he turned the online connectivity of his player to off, that the disc worked fine. I cannot say if this would have worked on the Playstation 3, so it may very well be worth a shot to those of you who still have the movie. However, even if it does work, i'm of the opinion that I shouldn't have to mess around with my network settings just to play a movie on my PS3.

TRASH. Wolverine is older than sabertooth. THEY ARE NOT BROTHERS. WOLVERINE is OLDER THAN CREED.they showed gambit old as hell. wolverine is way older than sabertooth.x-men origins was trash. the blob is same age as scott summers a.k.a cyclops. they made him in his 30s. trash. i know all x-men movies were so trash. but im a big fan of x-men. so i watched first class. that was the WORST comic movie i ever saw.emma frost that old. she wasnt even born and mistique. they werent even born.xavier didnt start the x-men untill he was in a wheel chair with no hair. the first x-men was cyclops,jean grey, arcangel,iceman,beast. they had havoc, scotts younger brother.TRASH. mistique was same age as xavier. are you kidding me. this was the worst comic movie in history. i was hoping they can or was going to redeem themselves but they just made crap. the only comic movie they do right, is DC/ love batman and superman.Wolverine is older than almost every character besides bloodscream and apocalypse. all the x-men movies are trash. all the KIDS who didnt grow up with this x-men comics or cartoons dont know the story like us. they just watch harry potter and watch this without back ground and say WOW this movies are awesome. and they comment on us Fans and they think they know what there talking about. they dont know crap. all they see is that movie is awesome. witch us fans are like, that was trash. dont pay attention to harry potter kids they are just dumb.  the whole x-men movies are so badly written and actors are bad. mistique outfit is so badly design. god. gambit is older than scott. wolverine is younger than sabertooth and thier brothers. LOL omg did someone from DC write these stories to fail the x-men movies.LOL. ive been watching DC movies. i must admit the DC movies are a lot better than marvel. the only Marvel movies i give credit to is, Spiderman 1-2, Blade 1-3 are awesome. i really wish they had someone knew the x-men series written the story to x-men movies. Remember all the little kids going to disagree with us, they just saw harry potter and saw the x-men movie and they think its awsome. ask anyone of these people who rate x-men movies all 5 to name all the character real names and background. they cant. they will google it LOL.Any true fan will tell you this, ALL THE X-MEN MOVIES ARE TRASH. Any Harry potter kid whos under 21 will tell you this, I disagree, that movie was awesome. These movies would of been awesome if they never made comics and just made these movies up. That would of been different.But they did make comics before the movie. At least come close to the comics. Look at Blade,Spider-Man.Ghost Rider,Thor and Iron Man. They did off the Book. God at least the X-men could of came close the the comic book, X-Men 1, rogue and Bobby A.K.A Iceman were best friends not lovers.The story was bad. X-Men 2. God the story was really dumb as heck. time line was way off. Colosus was awesome. they should of went with a different story than Weapon X. So bad they had to change everything in Wolverine origins. Pretty much forget what you saw in X-Men 2, just act like that never happen. We re-Wrote the story. LOL really your kidding me. X-Men 3. God, i dont have to say anything about that part 3 trash.Juggernaut was so badly done. Would of been better if they did CG like the Hulk for Juggernaut. Would of been better than a vinnie.the whole Phoenix story was way to fast, in my opinion, they should of never put it the movies. X-men had so many great stories better than phoenix.What happen to Apocalypse? I rather see Apocalypse in a movie than what they had in those crappy movies. Wolverine Origins. I already said what they trash in the movie. thank god Marvel got Spider-Man and Iron Man. Any real Fans would say the same as me. Harry Potter Kids would love all the X-men movies. Keep that in mind. Ask them anything about the X-men Background. They will go off the movies X-Men 1-3 LOL. Thats sad they only know the movies.Real Fans agree with me.  THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE WAS MAGNETOS HELMET THAT WAS SEXY.You have to come close to a BIG FRANCHISE of X-Men. Its like BATMAN getting Replace by Robin on the first Batman movie ever, No. that will be stupid what kind of movie puts characters not even in the first apperance in the comics and take a Different team Like X-Factor Leader into X-men Leader. Oh yeah X-Men First Class. TRASH. Next thing you know they will have Superman First movie be replaced by Superboy. How you going to cross X-Factor leader Havoc to take over X-Men leader Cyclops. REALLY. I hate cyclops. but put him in there like the comicsSpoil Alert. If you read X-Men The End graphic novels. Sinister is Gambit's Father and Cyclops is Half Brothers with Gambit. Makes Scott Summers older brother to Gambit. Just in case to let you know how Wolverine  X-men Origins is trash. Sinister took scotts summers DNA and put it in Gambit when he was a test tube.Some of you idiots out there, angel is arcangel. like saying, Magnus instead of Magneto. Same thing, different nickname. But some people are stupid Not saying JOE who said angel became arcangel. Like i wrote in my review about the new angel vs the old angel replacement. Its not stupid Questions, Just stupid People. Stupid ----> Joe. Just that people are just dumb. complaining about names that change. same people but different name.

But given that there are now five of these movies I can tell you objectively that I'd order them as follows:1. First Class2. X-Men United3. X-Men4. The Last Stand5. WolverineThe negatives...include some plot gaps--never showed Magneto helping Prof X build Cerebro under ground, absolutely no indication in the original X-Men that Mystique was an X-Man, and the statement by Prof X in the original X-Men that he met Magneto when he was 17 (but in First Class he clearly is in his early-20s), among others--that make First Class its own story within the X-Men mythology and not necessarily a true prequel to X-Men. (They did try to stay somewhat consistent as Mystique becomes Magneto's buddy by the end of the flick.) I also thought it was odd that original comic book team members Scott Summers and Jean Grey were not part of this story. Perhaps they figured they needed to introduce ""new"" characters but in reality those two should have been part of it....are far outweighed by the positives, primarily the performances of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Charles Xavier/Professor X and Eric Lehnsherr/Magneto, respectively. Magneto is portrayed as a child abused by experimentary methods of Sebastian Shaw, a Nazi during WWII. Shaw, while different in context than the comics, was done creatively and Kevin Bacon nailed the performance; the handoff of power from Shaw to Magneto was also sensational.The bottom line is that fans of the franchise NEED to own this movie.

This one, despite how it differs in places from ""core"" (as though Marvel hasn't played with this series in countless ways over the years).  It was great to go back in time and see the beginning of things.X-Men First Class is set in the 1960s, which is another kick...the clothes, the hair, the cars!  OMG!  We also get to see Charles Xavier and Magneto as younger men and why Magneto is as he is, the horrors he went through as a child during the time of WW2.  It makes his eventual actions all the more understandable.  This is very much a movie about the two of them, highlighting their deep bond...which makes the inevitable split on their beliefs about the future of mutantkind all the more poignant.  You can definitely see why he chose his path and why Charles fought to keep him from going down that path.There are some familiar mutants in this movie and some ones less well known.  Seeing our favorite blue shape-shifter as a young girl is wonderful and I really enjoyed how she met Charles and how their relationship evolved.The final battle scenes playing off against the Cuban Missile crisis is brilliant, absolutely brilliant.  The special effects are great.  The characters are finely drawn.  The actors chosen for them are perfect.  This has to be one of the best X-Men movies...even if my sweetie, Wolverine, isn't one of the main characters this time around.I saw this in the theatre and have watched it multiple times on my Blu-Ray.

1415084,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B004LWZW42,G. Denick,"[1, 1]","Gone is the campiness that has plagued many of the previous Marvel movies. The writers of this flick deserve to be praised for their mature, intelligent take on the origins of the X-Men and their enemies. I know many die-hard comic fans will not like the movie, but for the more casual fans like myself, this movie is a great take on the world of superheroes. There are, of course, many scenarios that require a suspension of disbelief... but if you can't do that, you probably shouldn't be watching a movie about comic book characters, right?Of particular genius is the relationship that is explored between the young Magneto and Xavier. Their friendship is genuine and heartfelt, and by the end of the movie, you are convinced that they have become spiritual brothers... although they must unfortunately become enemies due to irreconcilable differences in their fundamental beliefs. You actually feel that each of them is justified in their philosophical views, considering what their life experiences have been. In fact, many viewers will be more sympathetic toward the future ""villain"", Magneto, than to Professor X.The actors that portray Magneto and Xavier are brilliant. They give an unquestionable dignity and credibility to the characters. It would have been real easy to screw up an origin story of these legendary characters, but the actors and writers nailed it.I especially liked how there were no big name actors in this movie (other than a hilarious cameo by Hugh Jackman). The lack of recognizable faces was a welcome breath of fresh air... It helped to establish credibility in this fictional universe, and honestly, the actors did as good of a job as anyone in Hollywood.It also bears mentioning that the character of ""Azazel"" - who is essentially the Devil Incarnate, is incredible. I'm not a huge comic fan, so I've never even heard of him, but... jeez, he's ""effective"". I dare say he would give Wolverine a run for his money!On a final note, the manner in which the story is weaved into the Cuban Missile Crisis and the height of the Cold War is brilliant.

1415088,A26IVJJTXOE85B,B004LWZW42,Georgio Alfani,"[13, 27]","SPOILERS!!!!This movies sucks! I can't believe so many people regard it as one of the best comic book films ever. People who have blu ray disc that are not working should be thankful. Here is a film that is suppose to tell the origin of the whole x-men IDEOLOGY, the struggle between magneto and Xavier, the struggle between violence versus non violence, and they completely fail at conveying any true depth in the emotional aspects of the storytelling. The movie completely sleep walks through the emotional aspects with no exploration of the psychological dynamics behind those emotions. A perfect example is when Mystique crosses over to Magneto's side. This was such a pathetic scene, done just for the sake of betrayal, but what was the emotional motivation behind that betrayal? Because Magneto puckered lips with her? Because he told her she looked better blue? That's why she betrays Xavier? YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!! Mystique is suppose to be a mentally unstable shape shifter with an identity crisis, like in the comic! What is this Xavier's sister crap? She's just an insecure weakling who wants to fit in! Whoever thought it was a good idea to make Mystique Xavier's sister should be shot.Moving on, this film totally misses the ball when it comes to Xavier. Who is this guy? He's just some Richie Rich womanizer who lives it up and for no reason is non violent. There's no reason at all!!! I can't believe they didn't explore the psychological dynamics for why Xavier has chosen a life of non-violence! That's where the story is suppose to be! They left out his whole story! The struggles with his brother, Cain Marko. Cain abused Xavier and there are a lot of psychological constructs that are formed in Xavier due to these events with Cain. Also Xavier's experience as a medic in the Korean War(?) and the whole ordeal with Moira; all this was cut out for nonsense or just to focus on Magneto. This story is almost as bad as X3. How can you not focus on Xavier!! And you ""X-men fans"" like this film?!Then there's the stupidest scene in the history of comic book films; the scene when the team first sees Hank as Beast and Mystique says ""This is who you were meant to be."" It's enough to make me barf. i like to rewind and put that scene on repeat just so I can laugh hilariously!! You people really think that line in screenplay is logical? This guy experimented on himself!!!! How in God's name is that suppose to be ""who he's meant to be"" if it was attained unnaturally?! What a joke!That line right there, completely reveals the ignorance of the writers and film makers on their understanding of the X-men ideology.Don't even get me started on the feet! Why it was so hard to get this guy a body cast to make him look big? We'll never know!And what the hell is with Havoc's hoola hoops? This guy is suppose to raise hell when he bursts, not this corny crap!This movie is so stupid. One moment you got Xavier talking about how mutation is an evolutionary process, referring to the Neanderthal and genetics, then the next moment you got the dumb ass villain talking about how radiation gave birth to mutants. What?! It's like an 8th grader wrote this film.The villain's plot is ridiculous. He want's to start nuclear war because the radiation will cause mutation. He even goes as far as literally saying, ""radiation gave birth to mutants."" This is complete crap. If you read the comics or have seen any of Bryan Singer's films, you will know that mutation was all about EVOLUTION!!!! This is X-Men, not the Incredible Hulk! Can mutation be a result of radiation? Yes. But the type of mutation that creates the mutants in X-Men is due to evolution; a slow process. Just listen to Xavier's opening statement in X1. And Bryan Singer supposedly wrote this? Moron can't even remember the continuity/content of his own films! I lost all respect for him now and it's evident ""the Usual Suspects"" and X1 was just luck. X2 was good but what he did to Rogue's character was not right and was just a hint of his stupidity ...don't eve get me started on Superman Returns.Another horrible thing about this film is the directing. i miss Singer's direction. It was very sophisticated and i feel like he took the material seriously. here, it goes back and forth from being serious to being wacky and lame..lamer than spiderman 3 dancing on the bar lame. The lamest thing was when Angel shows magneto and X her wings. It's suppose to be a secret... BUT SHE SHOWS THEM IN A ROOM FULL OF WINDOWS WITH A WHOLE STRIP CLUB IN THE BACK!!! No thought went into this at all!! This loses all credibility for the realism. Get with the program Vaugn!!!Here are two more continuity/illogical errors: Xavier says before the team puts on the yellow suits that they were bulletproof, then what happens? HE GETS SHOT IN THE BACK!!!! Then at the end of the movie the CIA, i repeat again, THE CIA can't find xavier simply because he mind wiped Moira. THIS IS SO STUPID!! XAVIER IS A FILTHY RICH FAT CAT WHO OPENLY USED HIS NAME WHEN HE WAS WITH THE CIA..HIS FAMILY IS RICH, I'M PRETTY SURE PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY KNOW WHO THE XAVIER'S ARE, YET THE CIA CAN'T FIND THEM!!!These guys can kill kennedy but can't find a rich bastard named charles xavier!! ha ha ha!! this movie is so pathetic it's hilarious and what's even funnier is how people close their eyes to these errors.Another problem is when Emma Frost uses her diamond form to cut a whole in the screening room for the CIA and tells them some idiotic crap about war. Look, IF SHE CAN CONTROL PEOPLE'S MINDS, WHY IN THE HELL DIDN'T SHE DO IT, RIGHT THERE?!!! It makes no sense!! This film is far from brilliant.Then there's the continuity errors, which are a disgrace to storytelling. People who say that this film is only in continuity with Singer's films are full of crap. Xavier says in X1, ""When I was 17, I met a man named Erick Leinsherr."" Wrong! Then the whole story from X-men 1 about Magneto helping Xavier to build cerebro is crap because in fact it was Hank who built it with the CIA!!! Another continuity error! And the whole dialogue from X-men 1 about how Magneto's helmet is able to block X's telepathy because Magneto helped him built it is another continuity error because Magneto got the helmet from Shaw!! Then you got people saying this is a reboot. Oh, Really? Is that why Hugh Jackman was in the thing? Is that why the original first class weren't in it? Is that why they decided to copy the opening scene from the original film? If this is a reboot, then the producers, along with Singer are degenerate morons who should be lynched because they excluded the classic first class just to put in ""mutants we haven't seen,"" which is completely stupid because it disrespects the source material. At least if this was a prequel it gives them an excuse not to put the original first class in it because of their twisted chronology.People only like this film because of the violence and because of Magneto. Granted. Magneto was great but so what. The movie is called X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, not Magneto. This is an epic failure in storytelling, so epic you could teach a college course on it.Enough is enough. The X-Men film franchise is officially dead to me. Thank God!",1,Horrible.Emotionless. Stupid.

Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.'James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lensherr and the mutants the gather around them include Jennifer Lawrence, Lucas Till, Nicholas Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones, Edi Gathegi, &Aacute;lex Gonz&aacute;lez, and even a quick peek at Hugh Jackman.  The year switches to 1962 when Russia and the USA were coming close to nuclear war so of course the mutants fight for the end of the attempt while another set of bad mutants under the leadership of Kevin Bacon and January Jones and Jason Flemyng et al face off battling powers of telecommunication and various forms of super human acts an by the end of the film the 'together boys' - Charles and Erik have become Professor X and Magneto.  Doting the over two hour long landscape are appearances by Rose Byrne playing the love interest and Oliver Platt simply called the Man in Black.  it is a game of subterfuge as well as a gradually coming to terms with being a mutant that keeps the ball rolling to a rather spectacularly staged battle scene as the Russian missiles are making their way toward Cuba and the United States.Matthew Vaughn directs the screenplay written by no fewer than 6 writers ad there are some impressive special effects demonstrated as the characteristics of each of the mutants.  Entertaining, yes, and it stands alone well enough so that those of us who have not seen the other installments in the series  can enjoy it as a 'beginning'.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 7]","- Hank McCoy (while fitting the experimental Cerebro device on Charles Xavier's head): ""Are you sure we can't shave your head?""- Charles Xavier: ""Don't touch my hair.""This movie, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, extends a bold middle finger to the X-Men's comic book continuity, and I didn't mind it too much; that's how much I liked it. FIRST CLASS is the prequel, but it feels like a reboot. Taking place mostly in the early '60s and set in the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis, it chronicles the gestation of the X-Men and the founding of Charles Xavier's school. Even more strongly, it tracks the friendship (and its inevitable dissolution) between our two central characters, visionary Professor Charles Xavier and the tormented Eric Lensherr, who in due time would terrorize the world as Magneto, Master of Magnetism. Also, Hugh Jackman cameos, Rebecca Romijn cameos, and John F. Kennedy cameos.If you can overlook the rather towering continuity breaks from the source material and, if you care about them, from the previous films, then X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is solid viewing. Me, I've had to shift perspective over the years, had to separate the comic book from its movie adaptation, because the two aren't necessarily the same thing. They, in fact, mostly aren't. Still, the fan boy in me is royally miffed that Banshee is portrayed as neither Irish nor an adult.But maybe the biggest veer away from the original mythos is that, here, Xavier and Mystique meet during childhood and grow up to be adopted brother and sister. That's an intense kick in the crotch, and demonstrates right away that director Matthew Vaughn plans to shake things up. But the story begins faithfully enough in a concentration camp in Poland, 1944, as young prisoner Eric Lensherr is torn away from his parents. In his distraught state, Eric, solely with his mind, unwittingly bends the iron gate which separates him from his family. This mutant act doesn't go unnoticed, and the unfolding tragedy would shape young Lensherr's character.Meanwhile, in affluent Westchester, New York, young telepath Charles Xavier hones his talent and eventually fosters a dream of mutants peacefully integrating with humans. Not that humans are yet aware of mutants, or as they'd fondly call them in the future: ""Stinking muties."" In 1962, Xavier is distracted from his hitting on college girls (using that unfailingly sexy science banter of his) by Moira MacTaggert, a CIA operative (yes, a CIA operative! And not Scottish!) who's sniffed out a possible threat to world peace and needs Xavier's expertise in mutation. In the course of investigating this threat - fleshed out by the Hellfire Club - Xavier meets Eric Lensherr, an obsessed gent intent on tracking the German what murdered his mother. Surprisingly, Charles and Eric strike up a friendship.Kevin Bacon, by starring in a movie with such a sprawling cast, gives more chances for people to play the Six Degress of Kevin Bacon, so he's got that going for him. Bacon plays the clear cut bad guy, as opposed to Michael Fassbender's ambivalent bad guy (or is it anti-hero? You certainly cheer for him enough). Bacon plays Sebastian Shaw, the mutant leader of the Hellfire Club who has the ability to absorb energy and then project it in nasty ways. I haven't seen Kevin Bacon in a lot of movies. While watching him as Shaw, I still halfway expected him to bust out dancing in defiance of some small town law. I will say that he's pretty damn effective early in the film when he was playing the creepy German (Shaw's previous incarnation). In 1962, in full-on James Bond villain mode, Shaw means to instigate World War III. Ergo, the ensuing game of missile musical chair.James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's performances and chemistry together are the reason to watch this film. McAvoy manages to infuse surprising charm into the stodgy Prof. X, and it's a hell of a hoot watching him mack on the ladies. As Magneto, Fassbender makes you forget about Ian McKellen. Fassbender is younger and more virile and he transforms Eric Lensherr into a three-dimensional character. His thirst for revenge and his belief that mutants are superior to mankind clash with Xavier's dream of co-existence, and yet there's enough humanity left in Eric that Xavier believes him salvageable. This conflict in philosophy is what ultimately drives their relationship and this movie. When the Cerebro device allows Xavier to sense other mutants on a global scale, he and Magneto don't waste time in seeking them out and recruiting them, but for different purposes. Xavier is excited to meet them for the sake of meeting them and to welcome them. Eric is more practical. He knows he and Xavier will need their own army to combat the Hellfire Club and to achieve Eric's own ends.If X-MEN FIRST CLASS isn't as good as X2, well, it's almost as. A lot of things happen, but the narrative keeps events from getting confusing. With an abundance of characters, it's natural for some of them to feel the pinch, to not get adequate treatment or even get one line of dialogue (I'm looking at you, Azazel and Riptide). The general audience probably won't have a clue as to who most of these cats are, and so my advice is to bring a comic book geek with you, although fair warning that that geek may be too busy pulling out his hair at all the contradictions and swerves and departures. Some of these characters are really far from being canon. One thing I thought the film did really well is capture the zeitgeist of the 1960s era. I somehow expected Twiggy or Emma Peel to stroll on screen.I won't really quibble on the choices made for Xavier's recruits, irrespective of their proper place in X-Men history and continuity. Frankly, I'm just glad to see folks like Havok, Darwin, and Banshee get the cinematic treatment. The f/x is competent. The fighty fights are swell. The lead actors are very good. If I had one big complaint, it's how awful the Beast make-up looks.

It is my least favorite (I didn't see the Wolverine solo), but I still thought it had good acting and special effects. It also had some themes as did the Trilogy -- this one focused on self-acceptance.Spoilers are below. The reasons this is my least favorite don't take away from the quality of the movie, but they are specific things I didn't like. One thing is that this movie had a ""to be continued"" type ending -- a clear indicator there will be more movies to follow. The trilogy had more definite/satisfying endings, even the second one where you had a hunch that Jean Grey wasn't gone for good. I also found it interesting that there were defectors from the good (non-violent) side to the bad (violent), and none the other way around.  I love a good redemption plot! Then, there is the use of the F-word for laughs, and the movie is more risque than I like (which isn't new for the X-Men movies).Aside from that, I found this an interesting origin episode.

1415113,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B004LWZW42,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[4, 37]","It's hard to imagine how far a successful movie franchise can fall until you see it being pushed out to make room for an even larger franchise. Sometimes this is done deliberately, sometimes by accident, and sometimes executive producers think the franchise is so famous they can trim their budget down to sock puppets and still make a buck.I don't really know where X-Men: First Class falls in regards to those categories. Maybe it's a little bit of all three. What I do know is that:1) The X-Men movies helped relaunch the comic book series.2) A thousand mutant-style movies and television shows popped up as a result.3) X-Men Origins: Wolverine tanked.With this timeline, it looks like First Class was thrown together to commit franchise suicide in order to make room for the juggernaut movie crossover that this whole Avengers series is creating (Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, etc.) Maybe I'm being too harsh. Let us dissect the mutant movie gene, shall we?The first thing I noticed was the plot. While it doesn't follow exactly with the comic book timeline, I'm really not that much of a hard-ass. The plot was good: compelling back story, the beginnings of the split between mutants who are pro-normal people and anti-normal people, rifts that create fear of mutants with normal people, a storyline that really made this a good prequel in writing.However, mutant casting just didn't do it for me. Could I have given the movie a pass on this? Of course, but when the majority of the action happens in mutant training and a big battle, you need some people with bad-ass powers. Granted, many of these powers are on the up-rise, since it is a prequel, but the problem is that it is seen as a cut-back in originality and special effects.Beast is a prime example. Kelsey Grammer was a CGI spectacle in the third X-Men movie. What do we get here? A walking, talking blue stuffed animal.Then we have an all-powerful mutant that screams at you in Banshee.In place of Archangel, we have a flying mosquito.Nightcrawler is replaced by his evil twin.We're shown the dangers of hula-hooping without the proper training in Havoc.Mystique shows off her baby fat.Magneto shows he's had a heart all this time.Professor X annoys everyone with his ""smarter-than-thou"" attitude.The only things that visually saved this movie hardly had any effects at all:1) Breasts2) Kevin BaconMost people know this as a formula for movie gold. Everyone loves breasts, and everyone loves Kevin Bacon. In fact, the characters of Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw seem to be where all the money of the film was invested in, besides having Magneto lift up one ridiculous object. That was the mistake. You could have Emma Frost(played by January Jones) put on gypsy clothes and have Sebastian Shaw(played by Kevin Bacon) throw snaps at people and they would have been stellar. It was the other characters that needed visual safety nets that they never really received, and ended up helping the movie fall into limbo.I really tried to like this movie, too, and I kept giving it passes because I wanted to believe, but once Beast came out looking like a life-like Care Bear, it was all over.I give X-Men: First Class two out of five horribly cheap and useless ""Coming Soon"" movie posters that should have given us all a heads up for what was coming.",2,Days of Future Past?,1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,3319,"['hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'far', 'successful', 'movie', 'franchise', 'can', 'fall', 'see', 'being', 'pushed', 'make', 'room', 'even', 'larger', 'franchise', 'Sometimes', 'done', 'deliberately', 'sometimes', 'accident', 'sometimes', 'executive', 'producers', 'think', 'franchise', 'so', 'famous', 'can', 'trim', 'budget', 'sock', 'puppets', 'still', 'make', 'buck.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'where', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'regards', 'categories', 'Maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'three', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'that:1', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'helped', 'relaunch', 'comic', 'book', 'series.2', 'thousand', 'mutant-style', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', 'popped', 'up', 'result.3', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'tanked.With', 'timeline', 'First', 'Class', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'commit', 'franchise', 'suicide', 'order', 'make', 'room', 'juggernaut', 'movie', 'crossover', 'whole', 'Avengers', 'series', 'creating', 'Hulk', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'etc', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'Let', 'dissect', 'mutant', 'movie', 'gene', 'shall', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'plot', ""n't"", 'follow', 'exactly', 'comic', 'book', 'timeline', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'much', 'hard-ass', 'plot', 'was', 'good', 'compelling', 'back', 'story', 'beginnings', 'split', 'mutants', 'who', 'are', 'pro-normal', 'people', 'anti-normal', 'people', 'rifts', 'create', 'fear', 'mutants', 'normal', 'people', 'storyline', 'really', 'made', 'good', 'prequel', 'writing.However', 'mutant', 'casting', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'Could', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'pass', 'course', 'when', 'majority', 'action', 'mutant', 'training', 'big', 'battle', 'need', 'people', 'bad-ass', 'powers', 'Granted', 'many', 'powers', 'are', 'up-rise', 'prequel', 'problem', 'seen', 'cut-back', 'originality', 'special', 'effects.Beast', 'prime', 'example', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'was', 'CGI', 'spectacle', 'third', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'here', 'walking', 'talking', 'blue', 'stuffed', 'animal.Then', 'have', 'all-powerful', 'mutant', 'Banshee.In', 'place', 'Archangel', 'have', 'flying', 'mosquito.Nightcrawler', 'replaced', 'evil', 'twin.We', ""'re"", 'shown', 'dangers', 'hula-hooping', 'proper', 'training', 'Havoc.Mystique', 'baby', 'fat.Magneto', 'had', 'heart', 'time.Professor', 'X', 'everyone', 'smarter-than-thou', 'only', 'things', 'visually', 'saved', 'movie', 'hardly', 'had', 'effects', 'all:1', 'Breasts2', 'Kevin', 'BaconMost', 'people', 'know', 'formula', 'movie', 'gold', 'Everyone', 'breasts', 'everyone', 'loves', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'fact', 'characters', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'seem', 'be', 'where', 'money', 'film', 'was', 'invested', 'having', 'Magneto', 'lift', 'up', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'object', 'was', 'mistake', 'could', 'have', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'played', 'January', 'Jones', 'put', 'gypsy', 'clothes', 'have', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'throw', 'snaps', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stellar', 'was', 'other', 'characters', 'needed', 'visual', 'safety', 'nets', 'never', 'really', 'received', 'ended', 'up', 'helping', 'movie', 'fall', 'limbo.I', 'really', 'tried', 'like', 'movie', 'too', 'kept', 'giving', 'wanted', 'believe', 'once', 'Beast', 'came', 'out', 'looking', 'life-like', 'Care', 'Bear', 'was', 'over.I', 'give', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'two', 'five', 'horribly', 'cheap', 'useless', 'Coming', 'Soon', 'movie', 'posters', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'heads', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'coming']",N/A

While the special effects in so many summer ""blockbuster"" type movies are eye-popping candy that are beautiful to look at (I'm looking at you Michael Bay!), if the actual story and characters don't intrigue you then the movie will just leave you flat. X-Men: First Class most definitely does NOT fall into this trap.While the special effects here are every bit fantastic they are in support of the film, not its rasion d'etre. This film focuses on the origins of many of the characters featured in X-Men 1-3 while throwing a few new mutants into the mix. (While continuity is different from the comics, the X-Men films have kept their own continuity and nothing in X-Men: First Class is at odds with the rest of the films. In this day of constant reboots that is a nice treat.) The origin stories of Professor X and Magneto take center stage, but each character (Mystique and The Beast, for example) are given their due. Most importantly every character has an actual arc - we see the characters personalities grow and change which is what narratives are supposed to be about (i.e. the human condition). Yes, there are some really great battles and impressive ""boss"" fights, but the dramatic tension is mainly forwarded by character interaction.This film does so much so well it is kind of like watching Munich and Revenge of the Sith mashed up into one movie.

1415122,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B004LWZW42,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[8, 17]","Okay, here's the deal: Firstly, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS isn't a particularly good film to begin with. Aside from the great work put in by Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, there's no really good performance work within the film. It's a criminal waste of talent of Rose Byrne, who is so darn good in DAMAGES, as well as Oliver Platt, who is a terrific character actor. James McAvoy is pretty charmless and Kevin Bacon is really phoning this one in.Secondly, it's a very uneven film. While, at the very least, the first two X-Men films worked on more than one level while maintaining a consistent narrative, this film is far too ambitious for its own good, and it shows. It wavers between being a 60's mod super spy throwback, a pseudo-historical drama, a misfit teen romance, a rousing big-budget effects extravaganza, a frenemy-type relationship drama with some homoerotic subtext (come on, you can't tell me that scene with Charles, Erik and Angel wasn't a little kinky and the film could have actually used more of that), and a revenge thriller all in one. And sadly, very few of these aspects work.Third, the characters thrown in are, for the most part, poorly chosen (this is where the really geeky stuff starts). The only ones that were chosen that worked in some kind of continuity were Darwin, Banshee and Beast. The choice of Sebastian Shaw as villain is terrible, particularly since he was also retcon-ed as a former Nazi geneticist. Shaw is a man of wealth and priviledge, and it's his greed and his sense of entitlement that makes him a villain. If they wanted to go down this road, the much better and much less nonsensical villain would have been Nathaniel Essex aka Mr. Sinister. He IS a geneticist in Marvel continuity and has lived for a VERY long time.However, this is not the worst part. What IS the worst part is how this ENTIRE film is completely undone and invalidated in less than ten seconds for nothing more that a wink and an extremely cheap laugh: Hugh Jackman in a cameo as Wolverine.Why does this invalidate this film's existence? Prepare yourself for the threshold of geek rage. Turn back now if you might be upset or confused. With Hugh Jackman appearing as Wolverine/Logan/James Howlett in a 10-second cameo, it takes already-established continuity within Fox's X-Franchise and UTTERLY DESTROYS IT. The film is set during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. If you've seen X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (and I have, and it's not as bad as you might think if you go in expecting nothing), you see two ancillary characters: Scott Summers aka Cyclops and Emma Frost. If you know your comic continuity, you know that Scott Summers is Alex Summers aka Havok's older brother. OLDER BROTHER. And if we're to assume that the majority of WOLVERINE took place in the late 70's to early 80's, it would be impossible to make heads or tails that Scott Summers' younger brother was a teenager in the early 60's. But I'm willing to concede this point, since no one else (besides me) gave a crap about Cyclops in the other films. Also, we have a major character in Rose Byrne's Moira MacTaggert. This character also appeared in X-MEN: THE LAST STAND as played by the similarly lovely and talented Olivia Williams. In THE LAST STAND, she's decidedly Scottish. In this film, she is decidedly American, and since the original X-MEN film from 2000 took place ""in the not-too distant future"" and THE LAST STAND was released in 2006, that would make the 20-something Moira MacTaggert in FIRST CLASS at least 60 in 2006, but was played by the much younger Williams. However, I can concede that point as well, since that could be as much a fault of THE LAST STAND (which is a truly awful film, anyway) as it is here. And the relationship between Moira and Charles is important in continuity.I am NOT willing to concede this next point and this is the point where the entire franchise collapses in on itself like some kind of Hollywood singularity: In WOLVERINE, as I stated before, there is a cameo by Emma Frost. Again, with that film taking place in the late 70's/early 80's, we see Emma Frost as a teenager. In X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, she's played by a decidedly older January Jones. IN 1962. How can you have a major role in this film played by a different, older actress almost two decades earlier? BTW, is January Jones good in MAD MEN? Because she sucks rocks in everything else.Someone out there might say that this film somehow takes place in an ""alternate timeline"" akin to J.J. Abrams STAR TREK. I call B.S. to that specifically because they added a cameo by Hugh Jackman. It's not like Leonard Nimoy reprising Spock in Abrams' film since he plays a much older Spock. Fox was trying to link all the franchises together so they could continue milking cash from the X-Cow, but all they had to do was the same line with either a different actor (maybe Dougray Scott for you real film/X-MEN geeks?) or just show a hand with adamantium claws in the foreground and say the same line. That way... it makes a case for the ""alternate timeline"" option.Mostly, this film just upsets me because it's not very good, but it also upsets me because it can't even be bothered to respect the films, better or worse, that preceded it.But that's FOX for you. Show me a franchise they HAVE respected over the passage of time and I will salute you and do Numfar's Dance of Joy. I really don't think you'll find that, though.",2,"Hi!

1415126,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B004LWZW42,Jason Bean,"[1, 1]","'X-Men: First Class' is the best kind of comic book film. It features fun action sequences, great dialogue, thrilling situations and (best of all) well drawn characters you can understand and want to root for!The plot of 'X-Men: First Class' takes the series back in time as we see young mutants Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr as they grow up from the 1940's to the 1960's. Charles is a privileged Oxford graduate who has the mutant ability to read minds. Erik is a Holocaust surviver who's hunting down the men who murdered his family, in particular Sabastian Shaw who tortured him into using his magnetic mutant abilities. The main story begins in 1962 where the U.S. government has learned that Shaw is leading a group of mutants and trying to achieve world domination. They have Charles and Erik to track down other mutants to start a team of their own to combat Shaw.The story of 'X-Men: First Class' plays out well in a comic book sort of way. The mixing of real events like the 'Holocaust' and the 'Cuban Missile Crisis' seem a bit odd but it gives way for some interesting period detail (and some great nods to the old 'James Bond' films!). There are a lot of moments that feel a bit rushed (the whole movie was rushed in production) and we don't get much story or connection behind Charles and Erik's super-team (or Shaw's for that matter) but the relationship and conflict between Charles and Erik really drives 'X-Men: First Class' home. They are strangers who become friends who become close as brothers. There's one powerful scene in particular where Erik and Charles share a ""good"" moment in Erik's memory that in any other hands than director Matthew Vaughn would seem too awkward for an action/superhero film.Again, while the story is great 'X-Men: First Class' wouldn't be nearly as compelling if it wasn't for outstanding performances of the three main leads. James McAvoy is one of my favorite actors and he brings warmth, humanity and humor to Charles and has you rooting for him despite his sometimes naivety. Michael Fassbender is both intense and dashing as Erik (if this is his 007 audition I think he's got the part!) and makes you more than understand his quest for revenge. Kevin Bacon seems right at home as Shaw and raises his character above the usual 'power-hungry' villain (it's a treat hearing him and Fassbender speak in multiple languages!). Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult do good work at bringing out the relationship between Raven and Hank, but like the other actors really aren't given enough to do.'X-Men:First Class' is by no means a perfect film and has some obvious flaws (feels rushed, too many side-characters and tries to cram too much into a little over two hours) but it's a great piece of entertainment. With so many superhero films coming out this year it's nice to see one with some real weight to it.

1415128,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B004LWZW42,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[3, 4]","It's funny to think that there was a time when movies containing super-heroes were considered poison at the box office. Sure, the first Superman movie from 1978 nearly tripled its budget, but as time went on the sequels lost money. Blade made its production money back, but it was X-Men that showed that movies based on comic books could be a medium that makes money.With the first installment the box office saw more than double the budget of the film domestically. The second installment saw a rise in the budget and nearly double that budget was raised in box office receipts. With the third installment the gross increased, but the budget for the film did as well, and it was not nearly as proportional. By the time X-Men Origins: Wolverine came around audiences felt tired and the film couldn't even double its budget at the box office. Now we get another try at Bryan Singer's magic from X-Men and X2: X-Men United with director Matthew Vaughn and X-Men: First Class.X-Men: First Class chronicles the first meeting of Eric Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy). Of course, we as the audience know that these two powerhouses of mutants will eventually become Magneto and Professor X, respectively. Throughout the film, we also see the beginning of Xavier's School for Gifted Young People with Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Beast (Nicholas Hoult). Through the creation of the film we also learn of Lensherr's hatred for former Nazi doctor turned wannabe world dictator Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon).Stylistically, X-Men: First Class is a complete departure from the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner/Gavin Hood days of the film series. Where they were dark, this film is bright. The previous films held their dark colors to represent the darkness of the world these mutants inhabited; in this film the bright pallet references the bright futures the mutants have. That ideal is further exemplified in many references in the film to be true to oneself. Where X-Men was about being an outsider, and X2 was about the rage of being shunned boiling over, this film is about embracing who you are. That singular vision is what allows this film to rise over the frenetic and ill-conceived X-Men 3.Taking on a role made iconic by another actor is extremely difficult, especially when you're practically playing your counterpart's younger self. It's not impossible, though, as Robert DeNiro proved in The Godfather, Part 2 and Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto proved in Star Trek. Matthew Fassbender and James McAvoy once again prove it's possible to create a brilliant portrayal of a character attributed to someone else.For Charles Xavier, James McAvoy plays him as a smooth ladies' man with a brilliant mind. It's a refreshing portrayal of a character that seems too good to be true. Through the course of the film, McAvoy does a brilliant job showing the arc of Professor X as he moves from college graduate to mutant leader/savior. Fassbender plays Eric Lensherr with the verve of a globetrotting spy, almost like Bond with a vendetta. While a drive for revenge could have easily turned Magneto into a one-note character, there's much more simmering under the surface as he deals with his past, and learning that there are others like him in the world. Fassbender does a brilliant job of showing all of that in his performance.On the side of the X-Men, Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult bring the best performances. As Mystique, we watch Lawrence battle with ideas of image and how her image keeps her from getting close to anyone, with the exception of Charles who regards her as a sister despite her desire for a more romantic relationship. Hoult's beast has the same problem, and with an arc that resembles and digresses from Mystique's, he brings a brilliant edge to the character. On the side of The Hellfire Club, Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw is a great villain, and it's easy to tell that Bacon is having a lot of fun playing a villain that would have been at home in a `60's spy film.Not all of the characters receive the same fully realized treatment. As Emma Frost, January Jones is given decent material, but she either doesn't want to be in a super hero film or she doesn't have the acting chops to pull off the role, as she comes across as flat. Most of the characters serve their purpose in showing the beginning of Professor X and Magneto's feud as well as the start of Xavier's School, but when one of these mutants switches from the side of the X-Men to The Hellfire Club they're not quite fleshed out enough to make the betrayal feel genuine.Matthew Vaughn didn't just succeed at bringing X-Men's former glory back to the series, he exceeded all expectations to create the best in the series. Bringing in several influences from Bond to 60's culture, Vaughn creates something that stands out from the rest while remaining true to the spirit of Singer's first X-Men films.4.5/5For more reviews

1415153,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B004LWZW42,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[2, 3]","Like many people was hesitant about a new X-Men movie that was part prequel part reboot. I have a fondness toward the first three X-Men movies. And Unlike many people out there I really enjoyed X-MEN 3 and think it is a really underrated movie. Sure Brett Ratner's directing wasn't great but the story was good and so was the action. I also love how they weren't afraid to kill off the main characters. My biggest problem with the movie was the over abundance of characters the threw into the movie. I know it sounds like I'm giving a review for X-Men: The Last Stand but I wanted to make it clear I really like the previous films and wasn't sure about a reboot/prequel just like I'm nervous about the new Spiderman movie. Though after seeing this movie I view it more as a prequel.Now I was wrong X-MEN: First Class is a great movie and will probably be the best comic book movie of the summer. With the already underwhelming THOR. THE GREEN LANTERN which in all honesty doesn't look that good and CAPTAIN AMERICA which I really hope is good.One of the first things I need to talk about is the actors and many people may not recognize or remember. First Kevin Bacon who hasn't been in a lot of movies recently steals the movie as Sebastian Shaw as he brings such live and zeal to the character and I'm disappointed he won't be around for the enviable sequels. Then there's James McAvoy who hasn't done anything recognizable outside of Wanted. He plays Charles Xavior who I will always remember as Patrick Steward. He was the perfect Professor X. Still McAvoy did a good job as a you Xavior. Michael Fassbender as Magneto I had never heard of and again I had a fondness for the excellent actor Ian McKellen. I thought Michael did a excellent job as a young tortured Magneto and he even looks like a young Mckellen. Next I need to give a shout out to the movie great movie SUNSHINE and the actress Rose Byrne(Moira MacTaggert) who has been in many good movies and is a great actress. Then there are two supporting characters who I don't think had any lines but were great. The two are Riptide(&Aacute;lex Gonz&aacute;lez) and Azazel(Jason Flemyng) who stole the show from the young X-MEN which include Havok, Mystique, Beast, and Banshee. That was one of the small flaws with this movie was them. I just didn't care that much about them. It felt like they were taking space from the more important characters like the relationship between Xavior and Magneto. One last thing I always like to give a shout out to actors who don't get enough work and aren't well recognized. The first is Oliver Platt who character has no name in this movie but plays a high ranking agent in the CIA. Oliver Platt is a fun actor who doesn't get enough work. The last person is Michael Ironside who plays a Captain of a American Navy ship. Michael Ironside isn't a star but a great supporting actor who's had great supporting roles in such movies such as Total Recall, Top Gun, Starship Troopers and others. Though you might recognize his voice more as he's done work for The Splinter Cell game series as the lead Sam Fisher, Superman: The Animated Series, Justice League / Justice League Unlimited to name a few.The story that was blended into actual history was done really well. Especially Sebastian Shaw using the Cuba Missile Crisis for his own end was well done. The biggest problem I had with the story was the pacing of the movie. It's a small flaw but I wish they had edited out the scenes where the new X-Men students were training. I just thought they weren't really necessary but I think I might be nit picking with that. The action was really great especially in the middle of the movie when Shaw invades a CIA base. The climax was really good but they could have edited a few seconds out of it but again I think I'm nit picking with that when the action was really great.The directing by Matthew Vaughn was really well done but he's had practice with his three earlier films in Layer Cake, Stardust, and Kickass which were all good films. Again the only flaw I had his directing was the pacing of the film and editing.Oh yes the two cameos by actors from the first films which confirmed for me that this movies and the ones that follows are prequels. The first and longer scene was with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine though he probably hasn't been taken by the government yet. That scene was great and funny. Then there was the quick appearance of Rebecca Romijn which I though was nice.Overall this movie was great and out does any of the previous films which were good and I can't wait for the next film.",5,New X-MEN better than the Old.,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,4594,"['many', 'people', 'was', 'hesitant', 'new', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'was', 'part', 'prequel', 'part', 'reboot', 'have',

After all, X-Men 1 & 2 were gold-standard films.However, this may be the best X-Men film to date and it is certainly the best superhero movie since the Dark Knight Returns was released a few years ago.The script was well-written, thought-provoking and always on-point. The pacing and editing aspects of the film were flawless.And, most importantly, the acting was unbelievable. Michael Fassbender's turn as Magneto was among the best acting jobs I have seen in the last two years (and I have watched over 300 feature-length films in that time span).Kudos to Kevin Bacon as well. Initially, I thought Bacon would be a poor choice for the role of the primary villian, Sebastian Shaw of the Hellfire Club. I was wrong. Bacon takes on the role with an uncanny mixture of poise and glee that reminded me of why he was a star.But, what impressed me most was that this film was more compelling than any other X-Men films even though most of the characters are lesser known. People are pre-disposed to like X-Men movies that competently feature known-commodities such as Wolverine, Cyclops and Phoenix. (Many viewers grew up with these characters.) But a movie that features long-since forgotten characters such as Banshee, Mystique and Havoc? Very tough to pull off, but Bryan Singer, Matthew Vaughn and company did it.My only disappointment regarding this film is how it was marketed. Marvel spent so much energy pushing its first feature film of the season, Thor, that there didn't seem to be enough spotlight left for this film.

Booker,"[0, 0]","Just finished watching First Class and my impressions are positive overall, though at the same time a little mixed seeing that the filmmakers took quite a few liberties with the source material.I was born in '67 and grew up in the 70's and late 80's in what was, arguably, the heyday of the X-men, just before the title took off under Chris Claremont and the great John Byrne culminating in the Dark Phoenix saga and the subsequent spin-offs. First,Banshee and Mystique came along decades later in the X-men. The Beast didn't get hairy until around issue 106 or so around the time that the X-men became the new X-men with the additions of Nightcrawler, Banshee, Storm, Colossus, and Wolverine, who, I'm glad, they remembered to leave out of this movie seeing that he wasn't an original member. Also, I would like to have seen the Juggernaut, Xavier's brother, and the Blob, both of whom were charter members of Magneto's evil mutants. Also, where were Jean Grey and Scott Summers, Marvel Girl and Cyclops who were also founding members of the X-men?Anyway, inconsistencies aside, I really enjoyed this latest X-men movie. For the first time since they started making these movies, I felt like this was the most accurate and respectful attempt to capture the flavor of the comic. Even the old yellow and black costumes looked like the comic sans the big X on the front torso. The story was logical and provided a solid emotional justification for Magneto's fear and loathing for normal humans and showed how misfits could follow someone like him. The acting was first rate. I also like the fact that they stayed away from ""big"" actors who could distract from the story. As far as superhero films go, this is the best one since the Dark Knight. A real sleeper and very low key. Lastly, I think what separated this film from the others and made it better was that it had a different director, a better director, and it shows.

1415167,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B004LWZW42,Jordan David,"[0, 0]","Well, it's not like the alternative is necessarily working anymore.And with that, I mean those lonely, awkward pre/sequels that crop up after the original trilogy comes to a close.  Hell, even this franchise was subject to it a few years ago with X men Origins:  Wolverine.  And all it took was one of the most affable and widely known actors at that time in Hugh Jackman to have it barely break even with its budget in the states.The industry gets it:  They need fresh blood; rejuvenated passion.  A different perspective.  Luckily, they have all the freedom in the world whilst working with comic book universes, where we welcome the artistic diversification of our heroes and villains.  Re-imaginings, alternate realities...these can be the next steps in the evolutionary process of our beloved ""remakes"".  Notice that I didn't say, ""mutation"".  As if I were that tacky.Director Vaughn's First Class could very well be the best yet of these new species of successors.  Completely sidestepping the clumsy mess left before it in Brett Ratner's ""Last Stand"" and Gavin Hood's inspired, albeit misguided ""Wolverine Origins"", First Class stands tall alongside the more earnest and stoic interpretations of Singer and company, when X Men hadn't quite been a one-man Logan show.Contrasts and inconsistencies abound, however, prevent me from referring to it as any kind of true sequel.  It's something that devotees and casual audiences alike will need to understand before committing to the stylistic and uncharacteristically vintage atmosphere that Vaughn has framed for us to behold.It's a lovely, dedicated homage to everything that was hip before disco raped and pillaged the world on a mirror dance floor.  The ability to convey that warm, anxious 60's feel in the face of imminent nuclear war (or, at least as far as I can imagine it, going into my early 20's) is something that Vaughn clearly took very seriously, and it goes a long way towards giving First Class an acute personality completely alien to its predecessors.  I can only hope that he does the same with the inevitable sequels, where Charles and his X men face the trials of humanity as it struggles through Vietnam's, Berlin Walls, and Gulf Wars.  Vaughn had created a staple point in being conscious of the era surrounding the X men; he can't retreat now.Speaking of X Men:  Although I can claim to consider them my favorite ensemble in a rich world of comic book heroes, my devotion is limited by a few dozen readings of one of their later iterations (The ""Uncanny"" series) and a fascination with the awesome, awesome cartoon series of the 1990's.  I needed to acknowledge to myself that some of the names here would be unbeknownst to me before now.Even I can get some of the intermediates right:  Emma Frost, Havoc, Beast (before he was beastly).  And, yet, to be Sabastian Shaw under the performance of the ever classy Kevin Bacon not only showed me a villain whom I had not known of, it also struck me with a sudden rebirth of adoration for the franchise.  This doesn't feel like a coincidence; for many, First Class should feel like an embrace for fans - young and old - to come together for the first time and witness an entirely different landscape of the franchise.  The presence of Shaw was a rush; the presence of Charles and Erik was sentimental and nostalgic.Speaking of making a presence:  McAvoy and Fassbender are compete dynamite here, almost solely elevating the film to completely new heights as their relationship forms, cracks, dishevels and, finally reaches a bittersweet equilibrium that we all knew was coming.  It's something that the two performers almost seemed born to do, and I can only hope that their dedication swings in other young talent for the inevitable sequels.The other actors, not to mention the movie itself, follow in their wake, creating something that is feels adolescent and ambitious; still undeveloped, yes, but also brazen and distinct.  It's a firecracker of a movie, never taking itself too seriously, which was almost the downfall of the film adaptations to begin with.",4,X Men:  First Class,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,4086,"['Well', 'not', 'alternative', 'necessarily', 'working', 'anymore.And', 'mean', 'lonely', 'awkward', 'pre/sequels', 'crop', 'up', 'original', 'trilogy', 'close', 'Hell', 'even', 'franchise', 'was', 'subject', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'X', 'men', 'Wolverine', 'took', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'affable', 'widely', 'known', 'actors', 'time', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'have', 'barely', 'break', 'even', 'budget', 'states.The', 'industry', 'need', 'fresh', 'blood', 'rejuvenated', 'passion', 'different', 'perspective', 'Luckily', 'have', 'freedom', 'world', 'whilst', 'working', 'comic', 'book', 'universes', 'where', 'welcome', 'artistic', 'diversification', 'heroes', 'villains', 'Re-imaginings', 'alternate', 'realities', 'can', 'be', 'next', 'steps', 'evolutionary', 'process', 'beloved', 'remakes', 'Notice', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'mutation', 'were', 'tacky.Director', 'Vaughn', 'First', 'Class', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'yet', 'new', 'species', 'successors', 'Completely', 'sidestepping', 'clumsy', 'mess', 'left', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'inspired', 'albeit', 'misguided', 'Wolverine', 'Origins', 'First', 'Class', 'tall', 'more', 'earnest', 'stoic', 'interpretations', 'Singer', 'company', 'when', 'X', 'Men', 'had', ""n't"", 'quite', 'been', 'one-man', 'Logan', 'show.Contrasts', 'inconsistencies', 'abound', 'however', 'prevent', 'referring', 'kind', 'true', 'sequel', 'something', 'casual', 'audiences', 'alike', 'will', 'need', 'understand', 'committing', 'stylistic', 'uncharacteristically', 'vintage', 'atmosphere', 'Vaughn', 'framed', 'behold.It', 'lovely', 'dedicated', 'homage', 'everything', 'was', 'hip', 'disco', 'raped', 'pillaged', 'world', 'mirror', 'dance', 'floor', 'ability', 'convey', 'warm', 'anxious', '60', 'feel', 'face', 'imminent', 'nuclear', 'war', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'imagine', 'going', 'early', '20', 'something', 'Vaughn', 'clearly', 'took', 'very', 'seriously', 'long', 'way', 'giving', 'First', 'Class', 'acute', 'personality', 'completely', 'alien', 'predecessors', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'same', 'inevitable', 'sequels', 'where', 'Charles', 'X', 'men', 'face', 'trials', 'humanity', 'Vietnam', 'Berlin', 'Walls', 'Gulf', 'Wars', 'Vaughn', 'had', 'created', 'staple', 'point', 'being', 'conscious', 'era', 'surrounding', 'X', 'men', 'ca', ""n't"", 'retreat', 'now.Speaking', 'X', 'Men', 'can', 'claim', 'consider', 'favorite', 'ensemble', 'rich', 'world', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'devotion', 'limited', 'few', 'dozen', 'readings', 'one', 'later', 'iterations', 'Uncanny', 'series', 'fascination', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'cartoon', 'series', '1990', 'needed', 'acknowledge', 'myself', 'names', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'unbeknownst', 'now.Even', 'can', 'get', 'intermediates', 'right', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'Havoc', 'Beast', 'was', 'beastly', 'yet', 'be', 'Sabastian', 'Shaw', 'performance', 'ever', 'classy', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'not', 'only', 'showed', 'villain', 'whom', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'also', 'struck', 'sudden', 'rebirth', 'adoration', 'franchise', ""n't"", 'feel', 'coincidence', 'many', 'First', 'Class', 'should', 'feel', 'embrace', 'fans', 'young', 'old', 'come', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'witness', 'entirely', 'different', 'landscape', 'franchise', 'presence', 'Shaw', 'was', 'rush', 'presence', 'Charles', 'Erik', 'was', 'sentimental', 'nostalgic.Speaking', 'making', 'presence', 'McAvoy', 'Fassbender', 'are', 'compete', 'dynamite', 'here', 'almost', 'solely', 'elevating', 'film', 'completely', 'new', 'heights', 'relationship', 'forms', 'cracks', 'dishevels', 'finally', 'bittersweet', 'equilibrium', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'something', 'two', 'performers', 'almost', 'seemed', 'born', 'do', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'dedication', 'swings', 'other', 'young', 'talent', 'inevitable', 'sequels.The', 'other', 'actors', 'not', 'mention', 'movie', 'follow', 'wake', 'creating', 'something', 'feels', 'adolescent', 'ambitious', 'still', 'undeveloped', 'yes', 'also', 'brazen', 'distinct', 'firecracker', 'movie', 'never', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'was', 'almost', 'downfall', 'film', 'adaptations', 'begin']",N/A

There's a terrific, memorable sequence showing the 1960's era Erik Lehnsherr (pre-Magneto) catching up to some Nazi war criminals hiding out in Argentina, as well as quite a showdown off the coast of Cuba involving the American military, the Soviet military, the X-Men, some mutants lead by Kevin Bacon's villainous Sebastian Shaw, and scores of missiles. Acting and effects are top-notch throughout the movie.The one thing I could have done without, though, is the endless discussion between James McAvoy's Professor Xavier and Michael Fastbender's Erik Lensherr about the political state of mutantkind. As we've already experienced in three or four X-movies before this, Xavier again endlessly goes on about mutants needing to forge a lasting trust with humans, while Erik again endlessly dismisses that view and asserts that mutantkind must be ever wary and, in fact, should probably just dominate and rule humankind before humans try to control and enslave all the mutants. Back and forth, back and forth, the two characters chatter and chatter. What's more, several government types join the debate, too! Sheesh.I understand that this philosophical argument has to be a part of any X-Men movie, but does it have to be front and center all the time? For once, I'd love to see an X-Men film where there's a colorful villain who has nothing to do with the political and social issues of mutant/human relations, and just wants to rob Fort Knox or something. The X-Men comics do that all the time: break up the heavier stories with occasional tales featuring good old-fashioned high adventure, and even a alien invasion here and there.Having said that, though, I still recommend ""X-Men: First Class"".

1415174,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B004LWZW42,Josh,"[0, 0]","I have been a follower of the X-Men for quite some time now. From the comics to the cartoons, I even remember seeing the 1st X-Men movie back in the early 2000s. And look how far the franchise has come. I have watched the X-Men movies(including this one) numerous times, but none have impressed me the way X-Men First Class has. Here are my thoughts.When I first heard back in 2010 that production had started and who some of the cast members were, I did have my doubts. I remember having at least 100 questions like: Can James McAvoy portray Professor X the right way? and Is Michael Fassbender the right person for Magneto? And the biggest question I had was Am I going to like X-Men First Class? I went into First Class with low expectations and came out with extreme awe, excitement, and ready for more.First Class has an enormously well thought of cast that consists of: James McAvoy as Charles Xavier, Michael Fassbender as Erik Lensherr, January Jones plays Emma Frost, Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy, Zoe Kravitz starring as Angel, Lucas Till as Alex Summers, Edi Gathegi(Laurent in Twilight) as Darwin, Jennifer Lawrence starring as Raven, a memorably hilarious cameo from Hugh Jackman as Logan, and Kevin Bacon as the villain Sebastian Shaw. Everyone acted his/her role exceptionally well; Michael Fasbbender, Kevin Bacon, and surprisingly James McAvoy steal the show.It is not so much the story itself; the detail and the realness that this movie has is well worth mentioning. Ironically, the time period is set around the 1960s, a controversial and hard time in American history. Professor X poses the thought/idea that there is/are more to mutants than meets the eye; Erik offers that while mutation is indeed something truly unique, mutants can/will never be accepted in a human world. Erik sees superiority, Charles sees/wants peace. X-Men First Class has the necessary drama, the butt kicking action, and right amount of great acting to make this movie standout in a great way.I do have a minor gripe with Edi Gathegi's and Lucas Till's characters;(which honestly is my only gripe with the movie) I wish their characters had maybe been given better lines or more to do in the movie, but thanks to Matthew Vaughn's amazing direction, it is easily overlooked.2014 is going to be a big year for movies, followed by arguably the biggest year cinema will ever see in 2015. I am beyond ready for X-Men Days of Future Past, and while it took a lot of thought and heavy consideration, X-Men First Class gets a highly rated score of9.25/10",5,A X-Men movie like no other,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,2544,"['have', 'been', 'follower', 'X-Men', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'comics', 'cartoons', 'even', 'remember', 'seeing', '1st', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'back', 'early', '2000s', 'look', 'how', 'far', 'franchise', 'come', 'have', 'watched', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'including', 'one', 'numerous', 'times', 'none', 'have', 'impressed', 'way', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'Here', 'are', 'thoughts.When', 'first', 'heard', 'back', '2010', 'production', 'had', 'started', 'who', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'did', 'have', 'doubts', 'remember', 'having', 'least', '100', 'questions', 'Can', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'portray', 'Professor', 'X', 'right', 'way', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'right', 'person', 'Magneto', 'biggest', 'question', 'had', 'was', 'Am', 'going', 'like', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'went', 'First', 'Class', 'low', 'expectations', 'came', 'out', 'extreme', 'awe', 'excitement', 'ready', 'more.First', 'Class', 'enormously', 'well', 'thought', 'cast', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Erik', 'Lensherr', 'January', 'Jones', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Hank', 'McCoy', 'Zoe', 'Kravitz', 'starring', 'Angel', 'Lucas', 'Till', 'Alex', 'Summers', 'Edi', 'Gathegi', 'Laurent', 'Twilight', 'Darwin', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'starring', 'Raven', 'memorably', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Logan', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'villain', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'Everyone', 'acted', 'his/her', 'role', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Michael', 'Fasbbender', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'surprisingly', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'steal', 'show.It', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'detail', 'realness', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Ironically', 'time', 'period', 'set', '1960s', 'controversial', 'hard', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'Professor', 'X', 'thought/idea', 'is/are', 'more', 'mutants', 'eye', 'Erik', 'mutation', 'indeed', 'something', 'truly', 'unique', 'mutants', 'can/will', 'never', 'be', 'accepted', 'human', 'world', 'Erik', 'superiority', 'Charles', 'peace', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'necessary', 'drama', 'butt', 'kicking', 'action', 'right', 'amount', 'great', 'acting', 'make', 'movie', 'standout', 'great', 'way.I', 'do', 'have', 'minor', 'gripe', 'Edi', 'Gathegi', 'Lucas', 'Till', 'characters', 'honestly', 'only', 'gripe', 'movie', 'wish', 'characters', 'had', 'maybe', 'been', 'given', 'better', 'lines', 'more', 'do', 'movie', 'thanks', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'amazing', 'direction', 'easily', 'overlooked.2014', 'going', 'be', 'big', 'year', 'movies', 'followed', 'arguably', 'biggest', 'year', 'cinema', 'will', 'ever', 'see', '2015', 'am', 'ready', 'X-Men', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', 'took', 'lot', 'thought', 'heavy', 'consideration', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'highly', 'rated', 'score', 'of9.25/10']",N/A
1415175,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004LWZW42,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[113, 139]","What drew me to check out X-Men: First Class was not any particular love of comic books nor any particular fondness of the previous films. What drew me to this film was the presence of actor Michael Fassbender, whose increasingly eclectic work has continued to impress me more and more with each new film he appears in. I recall little about the first three X-Men films, besides that I found them enjoyable and I admit that I haven't even bothered to see X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I figured it was only a matter of time before Fox rebooted the X-Men series after the lackluster reception of the last two X-Men films. Bringing in director Matthew Vaughn, the director of 2010's cult hit Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class is a summer blockbuster that delivers on all fronts, while reinventing and re-energizing the series.The film opens with the same scene that opened the first film, introducing us to Erik Lehnsherr as he's separated from his mother at a Nazi prison camp. These first scenes, particularly Erik meeting his mortal enemy Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), are surprisingly effective. Several years later, the film sets itself up against the backdrop of the 1960s Cuban Missile Crisis as Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is recruited by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) to assemble a team of mutants for the purpose of stopping Shaw from triggering World War III. Charles forms a partnership with the vengeful Erik (Fassbender) to help him assemble the team, which already consists of Charles' adopted sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), and the film leads us through the events that culminate in Charles, Erik, and Raven becoming Professor X, Magneto, and Mystique, respectively.The story and screenplay give credit to six people total and the key to the success of this movie may be that one of those six people is Bryan Singer, the director of the first two X-Men films whose absence may have been what guided the last two films into mediocrity. His involvement, Vaughn as the director, and the changing of the time period all have significant impact on the film's success. The material seems much more at home in the 60s time period, while also helping to establish a different atmosphere and tone that separates it from the other films in the series.Vaughn emphasizes a steely, gray palette, an atmospheric visual aesthetic that gives the film a much bleaker tone than it's predecessors. He's assisted in establishing this effective atmosphere by the ominous musical score by Henry Jackman that lends to the atmosphere and builds the suspense.There is some great talent in front of the camera. Lawrence, a recent Oscar nominee is a perfect fit for the young Mystique and Kevin Bacon gives a diabolical performance as the antagonist, but it is Michael Fassbender whom I believe will walk away from this film a star. It's sad that with so many great roles behind him in the last few years Fassbender has to play Magneto to finally get the recognition he deserves. With that said, Fassbender's performance as Magneto is fascinating to watch and brings a new level of depth to the character. His charismatic performance shows Erik as a tortured soul, but also a (forgive me for not being more eloquent, but no term I can think of is better) bada**. Furthermore, he shares remarkably strong chemistry with McAvoy and these two work well enough together to carry more films in this series.What really elevates the material beyond it's predecessors and, for that matter, most superhero movies, is the level of drama and genuine humanity it contains. It's a complete success as a summer action film, but it's much more than that; it's a genuinely good, well-made film. In addition to that, it's almost unbearably entertaining. I found it riveting for it's entire 132-minute running time, while marveling at how it's so insanely entertaining without relying on contrived, repetitive, action sequences to guide its entertainment value. There are some negative elements; Mystique's makeup looks much cheaper than it did in previous incarnations and there is the occasional cheesy line of dialogue, but none of this was substantial enough to negatively impact my view of the film.X-Men: First Class is exactly what it's title implies; first class. Backed by a script that is both entertaining and intelligent, guided by great direction, and brought to life by a tremendous cast, I have no reservations calling this the best X-Men film yet. It has all the things you could want from a summer blockbuster; action, adventure, intelligence, soul, Magneto exacting revenge on Nazi's, great performances, and one of the funniest cameos I've seen in a long time. It's not a masterpiece, as it sticks a little too close to the summer-film template but, be that as it may, the heart must rule the head and I have no qualms admitting that I loved it.GRADE: A-",5,A

Paul ""John doe""","[2, 72]","I'm not totally going to bash this movie like I did Predators or Machete lasy year but X Men The First Class released back in June I'm going to go ahead & say it if you like this movie that's fine every movie has it's fans & it's haters so it's my opinion not against anybody X Men The First Class was directed by Matthew Vaughn he directed Kick A  s  s I haven't seen it yet. Stars James McAvory as Professor Charles Xavier, Michael Fassbender as Erik Lansherr aka Magneto, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, Jenifer Laurence as Mystique, Janurary Jones as Emma Frost, Rose Byrne as Dr Moia Taggert. Open the movie to Poland 1944 we have a young Erik Lansherr who was captured by Na  zi's they got his backstory right he's being used by this doctor we he kills his mother he gets uncontrollably angry the effects where he destroys the room look like Secret World Of Alex Mack effects that old show on Nickeloden but we get to fv  c  k ups  were introduced to a young Charles Xavier who hears something what could it be? Mystique & guess what? Young Xavier's like oh you can stay with us. Never did Xavier & Mystique live together or grow up together. Could just put the step brother plot in. But then again do we need another guy like Vinny Jones. We go to about 18 years later Erik is now an adult tracking Dr Schmit down for revenge. Xavier & Raven Mystique's real name there living together in Las Vegas where Xavier is going to College he has a head full of hair when he went completely bald by 18. Hels going around picking up chicks is he Gambit all of a sudden & he's saying groovy. He talks about mutations openly in a bar WTF!? You ge to see him drink from a bong looking thing were introduced to Moria MacTaggert of The CIA we also are introduced to the main villains The He  llfire Club  led by Sebastian Shaw couldn't 20th Century FUX used them for X Men 3. Well we get to the main plot The He  llfire group want take over the world what else! He wants this Colonel to put missiles in Turkey to start a war.Which leads into The Cuban Missile Crisis. MacTaggert convinces Xavier to help The CIA & they go to this Division called X. Oh yeah guess how Xavier & Erik meet he saves him from drowning cause Erik was going to kill Shaw in this particular scene. They round up other mutants to train to of course fight evil. Also Hugh Jackman makes a Cameo where they try to funny & failed but it was cool to see him. They to to be funny when they when Xavier & Erik capture Emma Frost. Hank McCoy is thrown in they totally screw him up where he made this cure & it backfires but the tranformation was over time not in 2 seconds & he's in love with Mystique. Beast is a tragic character. Let's get on with the grande finale more like grim finale. Magneto gets his hands on Shaw kills him despite Xavier telling him not to. It was cool how Magneto did it though. The Military fearing the mutants fire missile at them Magneto tries to use them against The Military Xavier prevents it we get a fight between them MacTaggert tries to stop it a bullet deflects off Magneto hits Xavier in the spine he's paralysed. Magneto is remorful so he leaves Mystique joins him. Erik goes by Magneto from now on he helps Emma Frost get out of the pokey. The problem with this movie is they try to mesh too many stories like they did in X3 & X Men Origins Wolverine. The story between Xavier Erik they were friends for years not 2 weeks & since when did Magneto take part in the 1st X Men. Just throwing Beast's story in with a 2 second tranformation. too many stories going on & a prequel was not needed I hate prequels more than remakes. James McAvory was forgettable Michael Fassbender wasn't any good as Magneto Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellan were better they had better interaction you believed those 2 were friends I'm sure that Michael Fassbender & James McAvory are good actors. Janurary Jones doesn't have much to do. Kevin Bacon was forgettable the animated Sebastian Shaw is better. The He  llfire Club should've been done in X3 they were filler anyway. I liked Rose Byrne & Jenifer Laurence they were the onlh likeable characters. I can't believe Rotten Tomatoes & IMDB have ranked above The 1st X Men movie  & X2  X2 was the best even X3 was better it tried to tell a story but it had a lot of good action it has it's problems though. Even X Men Origins Wolverine was better you atleast had a strong lead & some decent fights. Of couse who was the studio that released this movie 20th Century FUX. Tom Rothman needed to milk another franchise & looking at the money it made he was successful. I'll review a better movie next.",2,This holds a 8.1 on IMDB a 87% on rotten tomatoes that's total k rap btw giving it  4.5/10 is giving it too much credit 3.5/10,1310083200,"07 8,

1415183,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B004LWZW42,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 2]","Eleven years ago 20th Century Fox and director Bryan Singer introduced the world at large to the idea of mutants living among us with the box office smash ""X-Men"". Following that success a couple of years later with ""X2: X-Men United"", which was an even bigger blockbuster and an even better movie. However, when Bryan Singer left the franchise to direct ""Superman Returns"", some would argue the franchise lost its way with the likes of the critically maligned ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".Personally, I enjoyed both of those films (as did many audiences based on their box office receipts), although I do recognize their flaws. To those critics and even some fans that were displeased with the aforementioned last two installment into the franchise, a new entry has come along to right those proverbial wrongs. That film is the critically acclaimed ""X-Men: First Class"" from director Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake""), with Bryan Singer serving as a producer this time around.""X-Men: First Class"" explores the friendship between Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Set in the early 1960's, the two one-time friends and veritable leaders of the mutant race, join forces with the CIA to discover and train new mutants in the use of their powers. However, when a dangerous mutant named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) sets into motion events that could lead to nuclear war; Charles, Erik and their team of mutant recruits must band together to save mankind.When this film was initially announced I was excited because at the time Bryan Singer was attached to direct. However, shortly thereafter Singer was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, and eventually director Matthew Vaughn was hired to take over the reins.It was upon this revelation that my excitement for the prequel began to wane because Matthew Vaughn had already balked at the chance to direct an X-Men feature with ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". Thus, my confidence in him wasn't exactly solid. That was before I watched his surprisingly entertaining, tongue planted firmly in cheek, comic book adaptation ""Kick-@$$"".After seeing the aforementioned film, my concern for the X-Men franchise was quickly dissipating. My thought was so long as Matthew Vaughn, and company, remained relatively faithful to the material, plus made every attempt possible to ensure this is the best in the series; then the future of the franchise would be in good hands.So, let me say that I for one can attest that ""X-Men: First Class"" not only delivered the goods, but surpassed almost every one of my expectations. If you are one of the fans or critics or general moviegoers that were disappointed to some degree with any of the previous films, then this movie should easily renew your faith in the franchise.Written by Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz (""Thor"") the story for ""X-Men: First Class"" is jam-packed with history for not only the franchise, but even some actual world history to boot (albeit with a comic book slant). Not to mention terrific character beats (especially for the primary cast members); plus, taking considerable care to not trample too much upon the continuity that had been established by the previous films in the series.Admittedly there were some minor contradictions between this film and the rest of the series; however, they can be forgiven or explained away in later sequels. So I digress.On top of all that the film boasts some very entertaining action and visual effects set pieces that are some of the best this series has ever had to offer. From the scenes of the various young mutants training to harness their abilities to the film's climactic moments, the visual spectacle on display is well worth the price of admission.As always the best scripts, action, visual effects, and directors and crew members are all for naught if the cast can't step up to deliver the goods too. And this cast delivered with great ease and nearly flawless execution.Leading the cast are two very talented actors: one is the more recognizable James McAvoy (""Wanted"") portraying Charles Xavier, and the other is the soon to be recognizable, due to this role, Michael Fassbender (""300"").At the onset of this film you can forget some of your preconceived notions for the character of Charles Xavier that you may have gleamed from comics or the movies. Here we are introduced to a version of the character that's willing to be somewhat ethically loose with his powers. For example, he is not above using his telepathic abilities to hit on women in bars and such.Now, I understand that some could be turned off by this take on the character in his younger years, and therefore attempt to write off the film in the process. However, actor James McAvoy manages to portray this time in Xavier's life with such charm and personality that you can't help but be drawn in by him.And when the character begins to embrace his destiny as a potential future leader of mutants, McAvoy naturally shifts gears with the character. Over the course of his story arc James begins tempering the more spirited side to Xavier with an over-bearing sense of responsibility and a strong ethical moral code that we all know from the original trilogy.As for the future Magneto, actor Michael Fassbender portrays this younger Erik Lehnsherr with much more volatility than we've ever seen from the character. However, with that temperament, we also see an underlying sadness that is constantly at odds with his intense anger and aggression.When we see those flashes of sadness come to the surface of Erik, Michael truly excels at playing them off with genuine surprise and bewilderment from the character. Seeing these moments of vulnerability seep into the role was a fresh approach to Erik that we had not seen previously.Plus, witnessing the transition of Erik from a man consumed by vengeance and lacking any real sense of direction to a man with a mission and purpose in life was extremely satisfying and intriguing to watch.Separately both James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were great, but their shared scenes are simply excellent. The natural rapport the two share onscreen perfectly conveys the brotherly relationship the characters once shared in the comics.Honestly, if the Academy was willing to take a chance on another comic book property for a potential award nomination (beyond the visual and sound effects categories), then this film and its two lead actors could easily snag a nod. Of course, this most likely will not happen, but the fact that they could be considered worthy is a testament to the quality of this movie.Alongside the two leads are a plethora of actors and actresses delivering very solid turns, even if their characters aren't given as much to do as the aforementioned. The two biggest standouts from the supporting cast of young mutants are Mystique and Beast, played by Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter's Bone"") and Nicholas Hoult (""Clash of the Titans"").These two young talents deliver strong performances, and provide a different perspective on the events of the film than that of the leads. For me, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the movie spent as much time as it did showcasing the viewpoint of the ""students""; especially, since the driving force of the film was the early years of Charles and Erik.On the villainous side of things, we have Kevin Bacon (""Hollow Man"") and January Jones (TV's ""Mad Men""), portraying Sebastian Shaw and his femme fatale, Emma Frost respectively.Between the two, Kevin gave the stronger performance, not to mention having more to do within the story. His portrayal of Sebastian Shaw was an interesting blend of a charismatic, suave, and sophisticated business man, mixed with a cold and calculating killer, devoid of any vestige of humanity.To his credit, Kevin could have played the role over-the-top, which seems to be the temptation for so many actors when playing characters with a clear messiah complex, but he didn't. Instead, he opted to play things more subdued and both the character and the film benefited.Now, a moment ago, when I said that Kevin's performance was the stronger of the two, that wasn't to say that January Jones didn't deliver on her end. On the contrary, January did a good job portraying Emma, a character whose beauty belies the cold-hearted mutant she truly is.Some have complained that January seemed too emotionless and detached, but that's the way her character should be, so her portrayal would be accurate. It's just so many times critics aren't aware of the source material (I know I'm guilty of this too), and judge based solely on what they see whether that's the way the character is supposed to be or not.So, in the end, with all the terrific performances, excellent storytelling, and great visual effects and action sequences, ""X-Men: First Class"" is an outstanding movie! Serving as a perfect introduction to those who may be unfamiliar with the film franchise or its comic book source material, but also providing longtime fans another excellent entry into the franchise that easily erases any ill-will garnered from the last two installments.""X-Men: First Class"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",5,Class is in Session...,1308355200,"06 18,

1415184,ARAKTT5M3DDYA,B004LWZW42,JustMe,"[48, 62]","From reviews I expected a pretty decent movie.  Surprisingly, it was even better than I expected.  I liked all 3 original movies, btw, and I really have to say this was a much better quality movie still.  Good casting and acting.  Good story.  Great introduction to characters and tie-ins to the comic book universe.  Also didn't do anything to upset the time line with the  original movies, which I appreciated.  It was also neat to see actors I didn't even know would be in this movie, plus a ton of good actors who are somewhat recognizable but not enough that I could tell you who they were.  Some things in the story didn't fit 100% with the comics, but just pretty insignificant things, and  I really didn't mind at all.  For instance, it would appear that Scott Summers' brother Alex was older than him?  Aah, that's alright, Havoc was never that big a deal anyway.  And I have to say I liked Banshee in the movie much more than I ever did in the comic.  Not that he really had any lines, it was just really fun seeing him fly and do his scream thing...it always seemed a little lame in the comics.UPDATE: Just wanted to add that it's been almost a year since this was released and it's now continually playing on cable and I find myself getting stuck watching it every time I flip by it.

You understand how friendships were built, how they learned to control their powers, how the school got started, and why the school master is in a wheelchair, etc.If you know nothing about the Wolverine and XMen movies, let me briefly explain.  They are all societal misfits, mutants.  Their mutation is something different for everyone, but they are special powers, gifts, that allow each of them to do very special things, like cause storms, throw fire from their hands, move things with thought, read minds, bend metal, etc.  As is typical, the ""normal"" folks don't understand these powers and are afraid of the mutants, and many folks want to just get rid of them, causing the mutants to fight back.Wolverine is one mutant, a very powerful man.  He has claws that extend from his hands (kind of like a bear with extra long claws), and they are a very strong metal.  His entire skeletal structure is made of this metal and if he gets cut or shot, he regenerates and heals immediately.  BTW, Wolverine was maybe about 45 years old or so during the Civil War and is still the same age.  We don't know how old he is but he does not age and he does not die.

It reminded me that with a good script, and being true to the fan base, you can have a good film with relatively unknown, or at least, up-and-coming actors. They all did commendable jobs of filling the shoes of the more famous actors. Magneto, Professor X, Beast, Mystique--they all came across perfectly.I was also able to appreciate the feel of the movie. Set amid the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the film drinks deeply of the 1960s. It was Mod Squad Meets Blofeld, with the hip youth--Professor X chugging after his degree (a nod to Feynman),  Mystiques hip fashions, Shaw's stylized submarine (a la Austin Power's mojo jet). And not to mention Bacon's Ace Ventura hairstyle, and Scooby-doo suit. It all works.Yet the film retains the distinctive X-Man-ness of the first four films. And that may be a weakness. Some of the plot elements were already dealt with: the anti-mutant serum, accepting a mutantness (""Mutant and Proud""), ""outing"" mutants,  government friction, etc. These were all covered in earlier movies.

1415194,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B004LWZW42,Kevin F. Tasker,"[0, 1]","Matthew Vaughn and a cast of pretty up-and-comers (plus the ever-reliable Kevin Bacon) give it their all in this reboot of the X-Men franchise and yet a bevy of finely-edited sequences and masterly executed CG-effects cannot save the film from feeling particularly devoid of intriguing characterization or catharsis. There are early inklings of promising emotional connection, particularly with regard to Magneto's backstory. A surprise reveal in a Nazi doctor's office provides a backdrop for some heart-string tugging. And yet the inclusion of the Holocaust as a plot device feels forced--somewhat cruel--as though the filmmakers were simply capitalizing on a notoriously dour event for their own gains, the gene-splicing backbone of the story notwithstanding. This forced sentiment continues through the first hour of the film in which a dream-team of mutants is discovered (or not discovered, in the case of one amusing and profane cameo that will be worth the price of admissions for long-term fans). The trouble is, these kids never really develop beyond their 'talents', and are given little do but sit around in a room blowing things up, breathing under water, etc. They are never fully developed as three-dimensional characters. In fact, none of the characters are very interesting, save Magneto (more on him in a moment). James McAvoy's Professor X is humorous and affable but occasionally obnoxious. Kevin Bacon is playing Kevin Bacon playing a super villain. January Jones is wasted as the diamond-sharp femme fatale. It-Girl of the moment Jennifer Lawrence shows little of the range that earned her an oscar nod in the depressing indie Winter's Bone. Ultimately, this is Michael Fassbender's movie, though he takes control of the film about 1/3 of the time. Nevertheless, his character arc provides the only interesting plot progression or emotional emphasis, though this is diffused by everyone pretty much knowing exactly how this movie is going to end, and what will become of Magneto in the future installments. There is still something intriguing about watching Fassbender hunt down Nazis in Argentina or invade Kevin Bacon's lair late in the film. He exudes careful malice, indicating an interior spiritual struggle lacking in the rest of the characters, despite their ostensible difficulty adapting to their powers (the Beast subplot, for instance, falls entirely flat as the actor playing the large-footed mutant never really rises above his pretty-boy exterior). It is worth mentioning that the last action sequence lacks total bite as well. Much like the Holocaust opening, the Cold War suspense feels reheated (this is a big ol' historical event in U.S. history so most audience members will know how it ends up, regardless of the mutants' hand in it). In the end, thirteen year old boys should really love this flick, as will anyone who has never seen a movie, read a text book, or delved into the X-Men universe. Everyone else will be mystified by the beautiful CG shots (though expected from a $160 million action film--they never rise to the level of jaw-dropping grace and brutality set forth by Vaughn's recent Kick Ass) and sharp-toothed editing (particularly early on). Anyone else will understand that someone read Robert McKee's plotting tips and fashioned a snapping script for people who would rather be jangled along through slick retro scenarios than to take the time to understand how any of these characters function on an emotional level. Perhaps if the film would have been recut as a Magneto-only story, it would have been much more intriguing and adult. Or perhaps I am ruined by recent deconstructions of the genre (the ultra-violent Super, for instance, which also starred Kevin Bacon as the bad guy). Or with such an A-list of talent, I was expecting more.",3,Well-Made if Emotionally Hollow Re-imagining,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,3803,"['Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'cast', 'pretty', 'up-and-comers', 'ever-reliable', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'give', 'reboot', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'yet', 'bevy', 'finely-edited', 'sequences', 'masterly', 'executed', 'CG-effects', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'film', 'feeling', 'particularly', 'devoid', 'intriguing', 'characterization', 'catharsis', 'are', 'early', 'inklings', 'promising', 'emotional', 'connection', 'particularly', 'regard', 'Magneto', 'backstory', 'surprise', 'reveal', 'Nazi', 'doctor', 'office', 'backdrop', 'heart-string', 'tugging', 'yet', 'inclusion', 'Holocaust', 'plot', 'device', 'feels', 'forced', 'somewhat', 'cruel', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'simply', 'capitalizing', 'notoriously', 'dour', 'event', 'own', 'gains', 'gene-splicing', 'backbone', 'story', 'notwithstanding', 'forced', 'sentiment', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'dream-team', 'mutants', 'discovered', 'not', 'discovered', 'case', 'one', 'amusing', 'profane', 'cameo', 'will', 'be', 'price', 'admissions', 'long-term', 'fans', 'trouble', 'kids', 'never', 'really', 'develop', ""'talents"", 'are', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'sit', 'around', 'room', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'breathing', 'water', 'etc', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'three-dimensional', 'characters', 'fact', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'save', 'Magneto', 'more', 'moment', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Professor', 'X', 'humorous', 'affable', 'occasionally', 'obnoxious', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'playing', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'playing', 'super', 'villain', 'January', 'Jones', 'wasted', 'diamond-sharp', 'femme', 'fatale', 'It-Girl', 'moment', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'little', 'range', 'earned', 'oscar', 'nod', 'depressing', 'indie', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'Ultimately', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'movie', 'control', 'film', '1/3', 'time', 'Nevertheless', 'character', 'arc', 'only', 'interesting', 'plot', 'progression', 'emotional', 'emphasis', 'diffused', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'much', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'how', 'movie', 'going', 'end', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'Magneto', 'future', 'installments', 'still', 'something', 'intriguing', 'watching', 'Fassbender', 'hunt', 'down', 'Nazis', 'Argentina', 'invade', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'lair', 'late', 'film', 'careful', 'malice', 'indicating', 'interior', 'spiritual', 'struggle', 'lacking', 'rest', 'characters', 'ostensible', 'difficulty', 'adapting', 'powers', 'Beast', 'subplot', 'instance', 'entirely', 'flat', 'actor', 'playing', 'large-footed', 'mutant', 'never', 'really', 'pretty-boy', 'exterior', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'last', 'action', 'sequence', 'total', 'bite', 'well', 'Much', 'Holocaust', 'opening', 'Cold', 'War', 'suspense', 'feels', 'reheated', 'big', 'ol', 'historical', 'event', 'U.S.', 'history', 'so', 'most', 'audience', 'members', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'up', 'regardless', 'mutants', 'hand', 'end', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'should', 'really', 'love', 'flick', 'will', 'anyone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'read', 'text', 'book', 'delved', 'X-Men', 'universe', 'Everyone', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'mystified', 'beautiful', 'CG', 'shots', 'expected', '160', 'million', 'action', 'film', 'never', 'rise', 'level', 'jaw-dropping', 'grace', 'brutality', 'set', 'forth', 'Vaughn', 'recent', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'sharp-toothed', 'editing', 'particularly', 'early', 'Anyone', 'else', 'will', 'understand', 'someone', 'read', 'Robert', 'McKee', 'plotting', 'tips', 'fashioned', 'snapping', 'script', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'jangled', 'slick', 'retro', 'scenarios', 'take', 'time', 'understand', 'how', 'characters', 'function', 'emotional', 'level', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'recut', 'Magneto-only', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'intriguing', 'adult', 'perhaps', 'am', 'ruined', 'recent', 'deconstructions', 'genre', 'ultra-violent', 'Super', 'instance', 'also', 'starred', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'bad', 'guy', 'such', 'A-list', 'talent', 'was', 'expecting', 'more']",N/A

1415198,AIRCASSWQRZDT,B004LWZW42,Kolwynia,"[1, 2]","This is it: the X-Men movie you've been waiting for.  When I heard that the new X-Men film was going to be a prequel to the current X-Men movie franchise, I was a bit underwhelmed, but hopeful.  Having seen and loved Kick-Ass, which was also directed by Matthew Vaughn, I started to move toward cautiously optimistic.  The thing I was most worried about was how devoted this film would be to the already established X-Men film universe.  While I liked the other films, I do not think they were anything special.  This film is.The heart of the film is the friendship between Charles and Erik, the young men who will eventually become Professor X and Magneto, the leaders of the two sides in the war between Humans and Mutants.  James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender both turn in amazing performances, especially Fassbender, who plays Erik.  When you are watching him on screen, you can see a tide of black emotions seething just under the surface.  I completely bought him as the one-day enemy of humanity.But Magneto's star is not yet risen in this film, so it's a good thing we have a villain that is almost as cool in the form of Sebastian Shaw, played wickedly by Kevin Bacon.  His ideals are close to those of Erik's, and it is only a personal vendetta that keeps them on opposite sides in the film's looming conflict.  Shaw leads the villainous Hellfire Club, the precursor to Magneto's own Brotherhood of Mutants.  Everyone has awesome powers, used to devastating effect in the film's terrific action sequences.I really loved the young actors in the movie too.  It was interesting seeing young heroes that most of us are not that familiar with.  Havok?  Darwin?  And yet, I ended up feeling more for these young upstarts than I did for the classic X-Men characters like Storm, Cyclops, and Wolverine.  They actually act like young heroes, out of their depth.  The best characters here are the young Beast and Mystique.  Their journey of self discovery, and learning to accept themselves for who they are is a highlight of the film, and deals with the philosophical heart of the X-Men movies in a touching way.No X-Men film before has had this level of emotional power.  Frankly, the scenes depicted in X-Men: First Class put the the rest of the X-Men film franchise to shame with their intensity.  The whole theater full of people were practically holding their breath during the film's climax.And about the climax of the film: I can't tell you how refreshing it is to see the final action sequence in a superhero movie happen during the daytime!  I mean, you have all these cool costumed characters using awesome abilities, and almost every comic book movie has the climax of the movie happen at night.  Every Spider-man film.  The Fantastic Four.  Both Iron Man movies.  Both Hulk movies.  (I make allowances for the Batman and Blade franchises, since that is the way it's supposed to be in those worlds.)  X-Men 1 and 3...and most of number 2 happened underground, which is practically the same thing.  But here we see people flying around in the sunlight, lifting submarines out of the ocean and spitting fireballs and teleporting around.  Maybe some people won't care about this, but to me having everything bright and shiny and under an open sky is just fitting for a superhero film.  And it's a chance to really show off your special effects.  X-Men: First Class has excellent special effects, but by now I think we've come to expect big budget comic book movies to have flashy CGI.  What we have here is something infinitely better: outstanding character relationships and a wonderful story with moments of supreme emotional power.I highly recommend this film, especially to those who might be wary of the X-Men franchise after a disappointing third film (not to mention Wolverine: Origins, which is also merely okay).

I had my ""iffy"" moments with scenes I think the film could have done without at first, but eventually I was proven quite wrong.Instead of rebooting everything like most film directors do, they decided to take what was already done, put something else together and made something really good out of it. Obviously, the highlights of this film are Charles Xavier (Prof. X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). The actors really made you feel their relationship as friends with a common goal, but different perspectives. Something I think anyone could relate to. Kevin Bacon as Sebastion Shaw was just great. He could be possible be considered one of the best villains in cinema.My only gripe about the film is the lack of communication or importance of some supporting characters.

This is how the story goes: Before mutants had revealed themselves to the world, and before Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Not archenemies, they were instead at first the closest of friends, working together with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to prevent nuclear Armageddon. In the process, a grave rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-Men.The cast led by James McAvoy (as Charles Xavier), Michael Fassbender (as Erik Lehnsherr) & Jennifer Lawrence (as Raven / Mystique) is great. The directing by Matthew Vaughn (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is great.

The cinematography by John Mathieson is great. The film editing by Lee Smith & Eddie Hamilton is great. The casting by Roger Mussenden, Jeremy Rich & Lucinda Syson is great.

Having enjoyed the first two X-men films (not so keen on The Last Stand), I did decide to give it a go--and I am so glad I did.As much as I adore Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellan as Professor X and Magneto, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are more than worthy successors (or should that be predecessors? This is a prequel after all) in these iconic roles.  As the younger Charles Xavier and Eric Lensherr both young actors shine, paying homage to Stewart and McKellan at the same time as they make the characters their own.  McAvoy and Fassbender have an amazing chemistry which gives X-Men First Class its heart and soul, and are supported by a magnificent cast, including Kevin Bacon (the villain!) Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, January Jones, Rose Byrne, Oliver Platt and others.I'm personally hoping for a continued series of the youthful Xavier and Lensherr. The recent premiere of the sequel: X-Men: Days of Future Past--which is even better than First Class--gives me hope that this will be the case (and I certainly hope they can continue the two generation adventures--loved seeing the younger and older Xavier and Magneto in that one).Lots of nice extras on the First Class Blu-ray too!

Instead, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender prove themselves more than worthy of playing the young Professor X and Magneto, and the story provides a compelling and authentic-feeling origin for the elder versions of these characters we have already come to know. The basic psychological backstory is that Charles (Professor X) grew up privileged, and with friend Raven, while Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) grew up isolated in Nazi Poland, as the victim of brutal experiments played out by villain Shaw (Kevin Bacon).

I am not even sure if I will ever rewatch it.  I'm glad we got it out of a bin on Black Friday.It wasn't really that it was bad, it just didn't have any special grab for me for some reason.  I can't even really pinpoint why I didn't like it.  None of the characters particularly grabbed me, which I assume is because of the acting - none of them stood out to me.  The underlying story was interesting, particularly Magneto's evolution.  It just didn't feel well executed, somehow.  I also think it was a bit crowded; there were simply too many characters for them to show too much depth on any of them; even Magneto and the Professor were only superficially covered.  Granted, I think the point was a superficial introduction to each character, but it left me feeling no attachment to any of them or to the story itself.  I liked the Wolverine movie more somehow.  I am hoping the other Xmen movies are better.  I can't even think of much to say about it, so it can't have made much of an impression.I'd say watch it if you're interested in the Xmen story or if you like to always get the complete story, but as a stand alone movie it isn't worth much.",3,"Meh, it was so-so",1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,1264,"['Meh', 'really', 'sums', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'alright', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'incomplete', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'will', 'ever', 'rewatch', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'bin', 'Black', 'Friday.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'was', 'bad', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'special', 'grab', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'pinpoint', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'None', 'characters', 'particularly', 'grabbed', 'assume', 'acting', 'none', 'stood', 'out', 'underlying', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'particularly', 'Magneto', 'evolution', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'well', 'executed', 'somehow', 'also', 'think', 'was', 'bit', 'crowded', 'were', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'depth', 'even', 'Magneto', 'Professor', 'were', 'only', 'superficially', 'covered', 'Granted', 'think', 'point', 'was', 'superficial', 'introduction', 'character', 'left', 'feeling', 'attachment', 'story', 'liked', 'Wolverine', 'movie', 'more', 'somehow', 'am', 'hoping', 'other', 'Xmen', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'much', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'much', 'impression.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'watch', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Xmen', 'story', 'like', 'always', 'get', 'complete', 'story', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'much']",N/A

I was fortunate enough to get this edition at Target, and they have a ton of them there, so if you live near a Target store, check there and get yourself a copy!Anyways, for those of you who aren't aware, the normal Blu-Ray release of this film does not include a DVD copy of the film, which may be an inconvenience to some. However, this release does, as well as the Blu-Ray disc and Digital Copy Disc from the normal release. Unless you need a DVD copy of the film, you don't need to get this release. However, I think that this should have just been the original release, because it is convenient to get a DVD copy of the film. The film itself is fantastic, one of the best comic books ever made along with The Dark Knight, and it is presented in beautiful 1080P HD, with one of the best transfers released this year. The audio quality is also fantastic and will shake the walls with it's fantastic mixing and volume levels. As for the special features, they are solid if not a little underwhelming. The features on the disc are great, such as the X marks the spot viewing mode that has X's placed in specific parts of the movie to show a behind the scenes feature (kind of like on The Dark Knight release), a documentary on mutants, and some stunt work stuff. It was overall solid, but I wish there was more. Still, it is worth the price if you are an X-Men fan or enjoyed the film.Again, I don't know why the original release didn't come with a DVD copy of the film, I think that it is somewhat ridiculous. And if you are buying this product online, don't even bother because you will most likely feel ripped off. However, if you have a Target store nearby with copies of this edition in stock, it is worth picking up. It's the same price as the other release and includes a DVD copy of the film.

1415218,AX9C10JD538D9,B004LWZW42,Liviania,"[2, 4]","X-Men: First Class is the fifth X-Men movie and serves as a mingled prequel/reboot. There are those who insist it's not a true prequel due to continuity snarls, but let's face it: superhero stories and continuity snarls go together like ice cream and cake. You either accept that the two things are meant to be or you have very odd taste. The movie has a very different line-up for the team than the comic it is based on, but I thought they picked a nice mix of personalities and powers and hired a great cast. The movie objectively had issues, however. Some of the character arcs happened too quickly. By the end, the white guys were the only people left on the ""good"" team.But all objective problems were obscured by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's terrific performances as Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr. I grew up watching the (nineties) X-Men cartoon on Saturday mornings. I still have fond memories of Professor X and Magneto taking on dinosaurs together. McAvoy and Fassbender captured their intense friendship and underlying ideological differences perfectly.The rest of the cast does a good job, too.

1415222,A2CON4GD056OGB,B004LWZW42,Louisa the Lemming,"[20, 36]","I was soooooo exited and hopeful about this film:  It takes young Charles Xavier, champion of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants, his like-minded human partner Moira MacTaggart, and his anti-human nemesis Magneto, and purports to tell the story of how they all met and banded together in order to found the X-Men and save the world for the first time.  Of course this premise diverges from the comics I read quite a bit, but I thought it was an extremely good idea, fraught with potential for great character development, interpersonal drama, and moral conflict.  Likewise, the inclusion of Raven (aka Mystique) as Xavier's devoted friend and foster-sister is as far as one can get from a faithful version of her character.  But taking this ""Raven"" as an original character on her own terms, I thought (when watching the early part of the film) that she worked extremely well.  I was looking forward to what the film would do with these four characters when they got together.  Well.Words cannot express my disgust and disappointment, but I'll give it a try.&lt; SPOILERS >In the comics I read, Dr. Moira MacTaggart was a Scottish scientist, Xavier's closest friend and conscience, the co-founder of the X-Men, and the most significant ""human"" character.  This movie re-imagines her as an American CIA flunky who starts out performing undercover missions in her underwear, then hangs out with Charles and Company like a casually-adopted and mostly-ignored pet.  She has no romance with Charles, no relationship of any kind with Magneto, no scenes where she has any meaningful conversation with either one of them.  She expresses no opinions on human/mutant issues, has no personal relationships with the younger mutants, and generally fails to give any sense of Moira's personality, or any personality at all.  Does she have any difficulty trusting Xavier, who can read and alter minds and makes it clear to her almost immediately that he isn't all that morally scrupulous about it?  Does it bug her that Magneto is a vengeance-crazed psychopath?  Does she KNOW Magneto's a vengeance-crazed psychopath?  Does Xavier feel caught between them in any way?  Hello?  Movie???Well, that's it for Chuck's tragic love affair.  What about his doomed friendship with Magneto?  Well apparently it lasted all of two weeks, and was completely one-sided.  This version of Magneto never displays any of the ""good"" Charles delusionally claims to see in him.  He finds out that mutants exist for the first time, and pretty much instantly decides to use them as his lame-ass excuse for bigotry and slaughter.  No intervening years where he tries to protect and care for young mutants in a sincere way.  No attempt to co-exist with Common Humanity, to show that maybe Genocidal Psychopathology isn't the first and only lifestyle choice he's willing to even consider.  No attempt whatsoever to struggle with his own inner darkness!  He just takes advantage of Charles's friendship and help for his own purposes, and never seems to even consider doing anything decent in return.  What he DOES do is mentally torture Charles in a very cold-blooded and deliberate way, cripple him in an accidental and totally stupid way, abandon him dying on a beach in the care of the CIA flunky who isn't even a doctor in this version, AND take creepy and loveless sexual advantage of his sister  -- all while feeling terribly sorry for himself.  Yet the film portrays Magneto in a fawning fanboy manner, clearly regarding his self-pity, treachery and sadism as ""kewl"" and ""bad@ss"".This adulation of power and brutality results in Magneto using up a lot of screen time doing the same things over and over again, not because they make sense to the plot, but because certain minds behind this film are getting off on it:  Sadistic torture of Swiss Banker; Sadistic torture and murder of German war criminals -- and their bartender; Sadistic torture of half-naked woman tied to bed.  All cold-blooded, premeditated and deliberate acts -- during which Magneto obviously is in complete control of himself and his powers.  But other scenes -- doubtless remnants of some earlier version of the script that actually made sense -- suggest that Magneto can't use his powers at all unless he is consumed by blind rage.  Hence the need for Charles to teach him control so that he won't committ any more mad atrocities -- which in that context would certainly make sense.  But since Magneto can already control himself fine, what Charles is actually doing is giving him more power to abuse, which is morally indefensible and contemptibly stupid.  Another script incongruity is that Charles acts as though Magneto's murder of Shaw would cross some terrible line!  But Magneto has crossed the Cold-Blooded Murder Line several times over by the time Charles first reads his mind.  So why should the murder of Shaw be such a big deal, when the murder of that bartender apparently doesn't matter one bit?The characterization of Raven is similarly incoherent.  She is portrayed as a decent person with a smile like sunlight who is deeply fond of Charles, horrified by Shaw's brutality to the point of tearful hysterics, yet courageously determined to save her fellow-mutants from Shaw's corruption.  But when Magneto embraces Shaw's Mutant-Nazi ideology at the end of the film, she is in such a rush to become his lickspittle and sex-toy that she cannot even be bothered to take her horribly injured brother to the hospital first.  And Charles naturally gives his blessing to her new genocidal-doormat lifestyle, where all of two weeks earlier he wouldn't even let her drink booze.  Then there are the blank spots in her characterization:  An early exchange tells us that Raven is a waitress, not a student.  Why?  Because she is too proud to let Charles support her?  Because she prefers tagging after him at Oxford to getting an education?  Or because he wants to keep her with him at Oxford rather than letting her attend school elsewhere?  The reason would normally be terribly important to understanding where Raven was coming from, but since they flush her whole personality down the toilet at the end of the film anyway, I guess it's not.As for Charles himself, we learn very little about him, and what we do learn doesn't add up to an actual character, much less a hero.  He starts out as a womanizing jerk with no emotional relationships other than Raven.  He has no worldly experience (that they care to tell us about), but is the author of a creepy thesis about how common humans are destined to extinction before the ""superior"" mutant breed.  This would all have worked FINE as a prelude to his relationship with Moira, but that didn't happen.  And that's a problem. The fangirl in me hates to say it, but what's important about Moira isn't her accent or her job.  What's important is that her relationship with Charles -- their mutual respect, equality, emotional attachment, and shared commitment to helping young mutants for the sake of all mankind -- is the living embodiment of Xavier's principles, and the essential counterpoint to Magneto's ideology.  Without this relationship -- and without any meaningful relationships with his students -- the rather unpleasant and sketchy Charles Xavier we are introduced to is not allowed to solidify as a character.  His commitment to humanity and non-evilness is just words.  Words which mean nothing next to his ""Homo Superior"" thesis, his telepathic abuse of Moira and her colleague, his assent to Raven's corruption, his indifference to the murder of that bartender, his criminal gift of massive power to an obvious psychopath, and his constant doe-eyed gazes at Magneto which seem to say ""Poooooor Erik: Yes it really IS all about you"".  Instead of Charles being Magneto's friend-turned-archnemesis, he is only his pathetic dupe turned rejected fanboy.  This sucks more than I can possibly tell you.  But I've tried.",1,heartbreakingly horrible,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,7937,"['was', 'soooooo', 'exited', 'hopeful', 'film', 'young', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'champion', 'peaceful', 'coexistence',

1415233,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004LWZW42,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Comic fans were thrilled to death when they heard that the X-Men comics they had loved for years were going to hit the motion picture screen. That movie and it's two sequels pleased most but not all of the fans and brought new people into the world of the X-Men who had never heard of them. By the time the third film came out, fans were slowly dwindling away. It was time to start the franchise up with something fresh, something new. And that happens with X-MEN: FIRST CLASS.It may be new but its old as well, deciding to go into the past of the X-Men instead of the present or future. This time around we see the beginnings of the X-Men, how Magneto and Charles Xavier started out as friends and then took to opposite sides of their life long battle to gain acceptance of mutants, one through peaceful means the other through force.We witness the two as children when the film opens, one held in a concentration camp, the other in a mansion. Erik Lensherr's (later Magneto) magnetic abilities are noticed and brought to the attention of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who kills his mother to force Erik to let his abilities flow. A tragic mistake on Shaw's part as this sets in motion a years long search by Erik to find him and take his life.Xavier on the other hand lives in the lap of luxury. He discovers someone in his home one night only to find his mother in the kitchen. A few questions later and its revealed this is not his mother but a shape shifting mutant known as Raven whom Xavier's family adopts.Years later the world is a different place. It's the sixties and the cold war is in full bloom. CIA agent Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) is trying to find evidence that Shaw is involved with the Russians in a plot to overthrow the world. Her search yields the discovery that mutants are being employed by Shaw and she seeks out an expert on mutants to understand the possible problems, a newly appointed Professor named Xavier (James McAvoy).The CIA isn't convinced that mutants exist or that they can be trusted with the exception of one known as the man in black (Oliver Platt). He takes Charles, Raven and Moira to a secret base he's established. With the help of fellow mutant and scientific genius Hank McCoy and an enhancer he's made to assist Xavier with his psychic abilities, they begin tracking down a group of other mutants to form a team that will face the challenges of Shaw.Included in this group is Erik (Michael Fassbender), now trying to track down Shaw as an adult. He nearly finds him but once again Shaw evades him. With the help of Xavier's group, he now has a chance. He joins and he and Xavier strike up a friendship but with opposing views as to how the world perceives mutants.Shaw puts things in motion, manipulating the Russians and the Americans. His movements result in the Bay of Pigs face off. Can he begin a world war that will leave mutants alone remaining? Or will Charles Xavier and his X-Men put an end to his madness?The film does a wonderful job on so many levels. For one, rather than continue the story from the previous films, it takes us back to the beginning where we witness how this team came to be. It also presents us with the back story of why Magneto and Charles both view the world from separate sets of eyes. Both have a point but they're methods of dealing with the world are completely different.The film also presents a great way to learn the lesson of acceptance and of bigotry, the basis for the whole series of comics when it began. The metaphor in use then was of a world that wouldn't accept those who were different (at the time the Civil Rights movement was just making headway) and it's something we need to be aware of even now. The story of the X-Men was just another way to make us consider that though different in some ways, we are all at our core the same.The special effects here are well done. They never go over the top or try to make the viewer jump up screaming WOW, but are toned down to give us what we need to see and know without taking center stage. In so doing, we remain focused on the story with that added touch along for the ride.It's nice to see that they've taken this story and set the stage for more to be told. With this fresh take one can only hope that more will be made. Oh, and one small mention. This film contains one of the funniest best done cameos since ZOMBIELAND. Just be aware that it uses the F bomb if you have small children.

X-Men: First Class was billed a something of a relaunch for the franchise upon its release in 2011. Yet to dismiss it as simply being little more then just yet another movie that is starting (or in this case restarting) a franchise would be wrong. It is that, but it's also something more then just that.Considering the mark left by the previous X-Men cast, the casting of this movie is all important and the results are fantastic. James McAvoy as Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr (aka Magneto) both take roles upon which huge marks were left by two very well known actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen respectively) and very much make them there own, especially in McAvoy's case. Indeed the entire cast of young actors and actresses does well including Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert, Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy aka Beast and January Jones as Emma Frost. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the movie is the villainous mutant Sebastian Shaw played by Kevin Bacon, who clearly enjoys the chance to play a bad guy and is a fine villain at that. Backing them is a supporting cast made up of fine character actors including Oliver Platt as the &#8220;man in black suit&#8221; (seriously that's how he's credited), Matt Craven as CIA Director John McCone and Don Creech as William Stryker plus a couple of nice cameos from two previous X-Men stars. The result overall is a nicely acted movie all round.The production values work well in bringing the 1962 setting of the movie to life. Indeed the production design of Chris Seagers is highly evocative of the Ken Adam designed sets of the 1960s James Bond movies (indeed the movie seems to replicate Ken Adams Pentagon war room set from Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr Strangelove) especially with their now retro-futuristic feel. The costume design does much the same job of evoking the era, especially with the costumes for the X-Men and the female character's. The use of archival footage to set-up the Cuban Missile Crisis and the threat of nuclear war also highly evokes the era as well in a way that neither sets nor costumes can. Mention should also be made of the score by Henry Jackman which, though not necessarily evocative of the era, is nevertheless a good score that adds much to the movie as any good score should.After three X-Men movies and a prequel movie for Wolverine, First Class restarts the franchise by taking us to the earliest years of the X-Men. The year is 1962, the year that the world found itself on the brink of nuclear war with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Suppose, just suppose for a moment, that a plot by power hungry mutant Sebastian Shaw to destroy humanity and cause the rise of the mutants was behind the entire crisis? That in a nutshell is the plot of the movie. True, it has more historical errors then I can list at the moment but, for once, I'm excusing it. Especially as without them there would be no climatic battle and what would a superhero action movie be without that?Thankfully though, the movie does more then just action. Perhaps taking a cue from the 2009 Star Trek film, the story is as much about bringing the character's that have become so well known and giving them a new beginning. Indeed the movie plays up the friendships, rivalries and relationships between the various members of the &#8220;first class&#8221;. In particular this restarting of the X-Men series brings the at times testy friendship between Xavier and Erik and the relationship between Mystique and Hank are brought into focus which is made all the more intriguing because we all ready know where both of those are going, even if the latter does evoke some cliches in the meantime. The result is a refreshing new beginning.Indeed X-Men: First Class is just that: a refreshing new beginning. From good acting from a new group of X-Men to production values that evoke the 1962 setting, the movie shows a new side to the world of the X-Men. Indeed the script lays much of that groundwork as well with a story that's full of action yet brings the character's into focus as well. As a result, it'll be interesting to see where this &#8220;first class&#8221; goes from here after what might well the best X-Men movie to date.",4,Mutant And Proud,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,4371,"['release', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', 'upcoming', 'now', 'good', 'time', 'be', 'revisiting', 'previous', 'X-Men', 'film', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'was', 'billed', 'something', 'relaunch', 'franchise', 'release', '2011', 'dismiss', 'simply', 'being', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'yet', 'movie', 'starting', 'case', 'restarting', 'franchise', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'also', 'something', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'that.Considering', 'mark', 'left', 'previous', 'X-Men', 'cast', 'casting', 'movie', 'important', 'results', 'are', 'fantastic', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Erik', 'Lehnsherr', 'aka', 'Magneto', 'take', 'roles', 'huge', 'marks', 'were', 'left', 'two', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'respectively', 'very', 'much', 'make', 'own', 'especially', 'McAvoy', 'case', 'Indeed', 'entire', 'cast', 'young', 'actors', 'actresses', 'well', 'including', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Mystique', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Moira', 'MacTaggert', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Hank', 'McCoy', 'aka', 'Beast', 'January', 'Jones', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'movie', 'villainous', 'mutant', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'clearly', 'chance', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'fine', 'villain', 'Backing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'made', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'Oliver', 'Platt', '8220', 'man', 'black', 'suit', '8221', 'seriously', 'how', 'credited', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'CIA', 'Director', 'John', 'McCone', 'Don', 'Creech', 'William', 'Stryker', 'couple', 'nice', 'cameos', 'two', 'previous', 'X-Men', 'stars', 'result', 'overall', 'nicely', 'acted', 'movie', 'round.The', 'production', 'values', 'work', 'well', 'bringing', '1962', 'setting', 'movie', 'life', 'Indeed', 'production', 'design', 'Chris', 'Seagers', 'highly', 'evocative', 'Ken', 'Adam', 'designed', 'sets', '1960s', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'indeed', 'movie', 'replicate', 'Ken', 'Adams', 'Pentagon', 'war', 'room', 'set', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '1964', 'film', 'Dr', 'Strangelove', 'especially', 'now', 'retro-futuristic', 'feel', 'costume', 'design', 'much', 'same', 'job', 'evoking', 'era', 'especially', 'costumes', 'X-Men', 'female', 'character', 'use', 'archival', 'footage', 'set-up', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'threat', 'nuclear', 'war', 'also', 'highly', 'era', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'sets', 'costumes', 'can', 'Mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'score', 'Henry', 'Jackman', 'not', 'necessarily', 'evocative', 'era', 'nevertheless', 'good', 'score', 'much', 'movie', 'good', 'score', 'should.After', 'three', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'prequel', 'movie', 'Wolverine', 'First', 'Class', 'franchise', 'taking', 'earliest', 'years', 'X-Men', 'year', '1962', 'year', 'world', 'found', 'brink', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'Suppose', 'just', 'suppose', 'moment', 'plot', 'power', 'hungry', 'mutant', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'destroy', 'humanity', 'cause', 'rise', 'mutants', 'was', 'entire', 'crisis', 'nutshell', 'plot', 'movie', 'True', 'more', 'historical', 'errors', 'then', 'can', 'list', 'moment', 'once', ""'m"", 'excusing', 'Especially', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'climatic', 'battle', 'would', 'superhero', 'action', 'movie', 'be', 'Thankfully', 'movie', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'action', 'Perhaps', 'taking', 'cue', '2009', 'Star', 'Trek', 'film', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'bringing', 'character', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'giving', 'new', 'beginning', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'up', 'friendships', 'rivalries', 'relationships', 'various', 'members', '8220', 'first', 'class', '8221', 'particular', 'restarting', 'X-Men', 'series', 'times', 'testy', 'friendship', 'Xavier', 'Erik', 'relationship', 'Mystique', 'Hank', 'are', 'brought', 'focus', 'made', 'more', 'intriguing', 'ready', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'even', 'latter', 'evoke', 'cliches', 'meantime', 'result', 'refreshing', 'new', 'beginning.Indeed', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'just', 'refreshing', 'new', 'beginning', 'good', 'acting', 'new', 'group', 'X-Men', 'production', 'values', 'evoke', '1962', 'setting', 'movie', 'new', 'side', 'world', 'X-Men', 'Indeed', 'script', 'much', 'groundwork', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'full', 'action', 'yet', 'character', 'focus', 'as', 'well', 'result', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'where', '8220', 'first', 'class', '8221', 'here', 'what', 'might', 'well', 'best', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'date']",N/A

1415243,A3HBE3VAKQ7RYF,B004LWZW42,"Megan @ Book Brats ""Book Brats Reviews""","[2, 3]","I initially wasn't going to see FIRST CLASS - the previous movies, plus the atrocity that was WOLVERINE, had turned me off of the film franchise as a long time fan of the comics.  My friend, though, practically forced me down and made me watch.  The movie ended up being my favorite of the franchise, though, combining an interesting plot, great action, and great directing with some good performances and a solid script.  What it didn't have going for it, though, was a solid cast.  Some of the performances were just downright atrocious - January Jones as Emma Frost and Zoe Kravitz as Angel Salvadore stood out to me as extremely inferior to what others were bringing to the film, especially James McAvoy as Xavier.  Nicholas Hoult also brought a lot to the movie as Hank McCoy, while Jennifer Lawrence disappointed me somewhat with flat delivery at times as Raven Darkholme.  Or that might have just been the plastic wig.Taking us back to the 1960s and the Cuban Missile Crisis (which a girl like me loves, having studied the time period extensively for grad studies in international security), we are introduced to the foundations of the X-Men and the eventually Brotherhood of Mutants, the friendship between Xavier and Erik Lensherr.  The movie is just as much about the characters as it is the action, from their evolution as people to the friendships and relationships that created the series we know and love today.  Yeah, it was totally nothing like in the comics, taking random characters from various time periods, changing nationalities and back stories, but it worked in the scheme of things.The action was also amazing, with fully realized scenes and twists and turns along the way.  I was genuinely surprised that this movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting.  Quite frankly, it was really good, minus some really, REALLY bad acting.  I mean, acting that was flatter than a pancake.  Definitely give this movie a shot, though.DVD Features: Um...what features? There was a little featurette and that was about it.

1415245,A8YJ32NRV39I6,B004LWZW42,M. George,"[0, 0]","First Class focuses on the origin of three characters (Magneto, Professor X, and Mystique) yet it touches on numerous others including new characters. However, I felt learning about the new characters doesn't stand out nearly as well the ones we already know, despite even having pretty original powers. The old characters get the real attention with some great development on their motives and emotions via some great revelations. However, it seems pretty obvious that the previous films didn't have these revelations in mind with a couple holes that are bit too hard to swallow that none of the characters bring up the events from this film.With all that, seems easy to think that the action might be a bit lacking, yet it finds perfect moments to bring it all with tense battles that utilize the mutants wonderfully. I noticed that the special effects seem to be touch behind other blockbusters, with a couple moments that seem to rely on the CGI a bit too much, yet it doesn't come close to ruining any aspect of the film. The acting is great from most, most notably Kevin Bacon stealing the show as Sebastian Shaw. Also, the other mutants coming to terms with their beliefs on how humans and mutants should live together is often put into the spotlight with great results.The Blu-Ray itself features great video quality to showcase the bright colors the film is almost always using, and great audio quality for the booming explosions and crystal clear dialogue. There are really only four special features but they are all of terrific quality and length, especially the hour long behind the scenes documentary.Most fans would agree that the two X-Men movies before this have been a bit disappointing with more focus on action and tag-lines then actually developing characters farther. Yet First Class finds a wonderful balance between the two by giving some of the most memorable action scenes in the franchise and some great revelations and background development on many of the well known characters. Then, the Blu-Ray release stands tall with fantastic video and audio quality, and a good handful of quality extras. 5/5 stars",5,An awesome return,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,2133,"['First', 'Class', 'origin', 'three', 'characters', 'Magneto', 'Professor', 'X', 'Mystique', 'yet', 'numerous', 'others', 'including', 'new', 'characters', 'However', 'felt', 'learning', 'new', 'characters', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'ones', 'already', 'know', 'even', 'having', 'pretty', 'original', 'powers', 'old', 'characters', 'get', 'real', 'attention', 'great', 'development', 'motives', 'emotions', 'great', 'revelations', 'However', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'previous', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'revelations', 'mind', 'couple', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'swallow', 'none', 'characters', 'bring', 'up', 'events', 'film.With', 'easy', 'think', 'action', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'lacking', 'perfect', 'moments', 'bring', 'tense', 'battles', 'utilize', 'mutants', 'wonderfully', 'noticed', 'special', 'effects', 'seem', 'be', 'touch', 'other', 'blockbusters', 'couple', 'moments', 'seem', 'rely', 'CGI', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'yet', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'ruining', 'aspect', 'film', 'acting', 'great', 'most', 'most', 'notably', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'stealing', 'show', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'Also', 'other', 'mutants', 'coming', 'terms', 'beliefs', 'how', 'humans', 'mutants', 'should', 'live', 'together', 'often', 'put', 'spotlight', 'great', 'results.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'great', 'video', 'quality', 'showcase', 'bright', 'colors', 'film', 'almost', 'always', 'using', 'great', 'audio', 'quality', 'booming', 'explosions', 'crystal', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'four', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'terrific', 'quality', 'length', 'especially', 'hour', 'long', 'scenes', 'documentary.Most', 'fans', 'would', 'agree', 'two', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'more', 'focus', 'action', 'tag-lines', 'then', 'actually', 'developing', 'characters', 'farther', 'First', 'Class', 'wonderful', 'balance', 'two', 'giving', 'most', 'memorable', 'action', 'scenes', 'franchise', 'great', 'revelations', 'background', 'development', 'many', 'well', 'known', 'characters', 'Then', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'tall', 'fantastic', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'good', 'handful', 'quality', 'extras', '5/5', 'stars']",N/A

1415249,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B004LWZW42,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","X-Men: First Class is a return to the comic's roots and it's so good that it will make you forget all that came before.Launching a realistic superhero series is tricky.  Despite the mainstream popularity of the superhero genre in movies, there are still limits to what the general viewing audience is willing to accept.  As superhero franchises get long in the tooth, they tend to loosen up and start exploring the more extreme aspects of the genre.  Because the fringe elements of superheroes are not considered when planning the franchise, the movies also tend to become muddled and incoherent. For examples, see the Spider-Man and X-Men series.  This is why it's become fashionable to reboot the franchise and the second time around include all those disparate elements from the beginning.What First Class does right is give the series a sense of history. Although the various characters are important, they take a back seat to the go-go 60s, government paranoia, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. We begin with Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender as Magneto) in the grip of Nazi scientist Dr. Klaus Schmidt (THE Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw). Paralleling Lensherr's nightmarish upbringing is Charles Xavier (James McAvoy as Professor X) adopting a homeless shapeshifter named Raven Darkholme (Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique). Xavier's research in mutations is eventually co-opted by Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), a CIA agent who believes that mutants are a threat.  Division X is launched to counter the nefarious warmongering of Sebastian Shaw (SPOILER CLASS: actually Klaus Schmidt).  Xavier and Lensherr's worlds collide when they converge on Shaw, who escapes. Their alliance is one of convenience; they both want to capture Shaw for different reasons.The movie pivots on their differing ethos: Xavier is a horndog academic with noble ideas; Lensherr is a bloodthirsty fugitive hellbent on revenge.  Who is right?  It doesn't matter in the end. There are mutants and non-mutants, pro-government and against, those who remember the lessons of a world war and those who are doomed to repeat it. It's all about justifying the side you choose.As Shaw inches the Soviet Union and United States toward war, X-Men: First Class takes the gloves off.  Mutants are murdered (those mutants you don't recognize?  Yeah, those are the ones), vengeance is served, and CIA agents drop hundreds of feet to their deaths.First Class has fun tweaking our knowledge of future events in the X-Men universe.

1415253,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B004LWZW42,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""X-Men: First Class"" is a prequel to the X-Men film trilogy that takes us back to the founding of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, the first meeting of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr AKA Magneto, and revelation of mutants to the human race. This is accomplished through a re-imagining of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. The CIA's agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) discovers that genetically mutated humans may have some role in a plot to manipulate Cold War politics. She seeks out an expert in genetic mutation, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), at Oxford University. MacTaggert's experiences plus Xavier's unique talents force the CIA to admit that mutants exist. The man they are after is a Nazi war criminal going by the name Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon).A mutant himself, Shaw is playing the United States and Soviet Union against one another in order to incite a nuclear war that will eliminate humans and enhance the powers of mutants. But Shaw is pursued by an old enemy as well: Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) was one of his unwilling pupils during the war in Germany. Shaw killed Erik's mother, and Erik wants revenge. Erik reluctantly joins Xavier's group at the CIA, which is busy recruiting other mutants to the cause of Western democracy.As with the other X-Men movies, there are too many characters for us to know them well. ""First Class"" does, however, manage to say a lot about Xavier's idealism and his early relationship with Erik, who is the most completely written character in the film. Erik's experience in German concentration camps has made him pessimistic of mutants and humans living happily together and wary of any attempts to identify mutants. He hates Shaw but agrees with him. Ironically, Erik adopts the agenda of his torturer and mortal enemy and turns against Xavier, a man whom he respects and who saved his life. Other characters are not so skillfully drawn. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is featured prominently as she struggles with insecurities about her appearance, but she isn't a strong character.""First Class"" let me down in the visual department. I found the action sequences boring. The half-hearted attempt to set the action in the 1960s consists mostly of putting the women in miniskirts and go-go boots. There is some very advanced technology for the 1960s in this movie, which would have reminded me of an early James Bond flick if it had paid more attention to period production design. All the CGI and high-tech gizmos look very modern, not retro. I'm sure a lot of viewers think this is fine: the style of comic books changes but is not particularly true to the period in which the action takes place. But the lame 1960s recreations constantly gave me that sense that the filmmakers weren't trying very hard. A genuine `60s look would have been a lot more fun.",3,"Some Good Character Writing, but Dull Action and Lame Production Design.",1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,2825,"['X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'prequel', 'X-Men', 'film', 'trilogy', 'back', 'founding', 'Xavier', 'School', 'Gifted', 'Youngsters', 'first', 'meeting', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Erik', 'Lensherr', 'AKA', 'Magneto', 'revelation', 'mutants', 'human', 'race', 'accomplished', 're-imagining', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', '1962', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Moira', 'MacTaggert', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'genetically', 'mutated', 'humans', 'may', 'have', 'role', 'plot', 'manipulate', 'Cold', 'War', 'politics', 'out', 'expert', 'genetic', 'mutation', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Oxford', 'University', 'MacTaggert', 'experiences', 'Xavier', 'unique', 'talents', 'force', 'CIA', 'admit', 'mutants', 'exist', 'man', 'are', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'going', 'name', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', '.A', 'mutant', 'Shaw', 'playing', 'United', 'States', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'one', 'order', 'incite', 'nuclear', 'war', 'will', 'eliminate', 'humans', 'enhance', 'powers', 'mutants', 'Shaw', 'pursued', 'old', 'enemy', 'as', 'well', 'Erik', 'Lensherr', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'was', 'one', 'unwilling', 'pupils', 'war', 'Germany', 'Shaw', 'killed', 'Erik', 'mother', 'Erik', 'revenge', 'Erik', 'reluctantly', 'Xavier', 'group', 'CIA', 'busy', 'recruiting', 'other', 'mutants', 'cause', 'Western', 'democracy.As', 'other', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'know', 'well', 'First', 'Class', 'however', 'manage', 'say', 'lot', 'Xavier', 'idealism', 'early', 'relationship', 'Erik', 'who', 'most', 'completely', 'written', 'character', 'film', 'Erik', 'experience', 'German', 'concentration', 'camps', 'made', 'pessimistic', 'mutants', 'humans', 'living', 'happily', 'together', 'wary', 'attempts', 'identify', 'mutants', 'Shaw', 'Ironically', 'Erik', 'agenda', 'torturer', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'Xavier', 'man', 'whom', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'skillfully', 'drawn', 'Mystique', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'featured', 'prominently', 'insecurities', 'appearance', ""n't"", 'strong', 'character', 'First', 'Class', 'let', 'down', 'visual', 'department', 'found', 'action', 'boring', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'set', 'action', '1960s', 'consists', 'mostly', 'putting', 'women', 'miniskirts', 'go-go', 'boots', 'very', 'advanced', 'technology', '1960s', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'reminded', 'early', 'James', 'Bond', 'flick', 'had', 'paid', 'more', 'attention', 'period', 'production', 'design', 'CGI', 'high-tech', 'gizmos', 'look', 'very', 'modern', 'not', 'retro', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'viewers', 'think', 'fine', 'style', 'comic', 'books', 'changes', 'not', 'particularly', 'true', 'period', 'action', 'place', 'lame', '1960s', 'recreations', 'constantly', 'gave', 'sense', 'filmmakers', 'were', ""n't"", 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'genuine', '60s', 'look', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'fun']",N/A

This one focuses on how it all began with two different perspectives of the future good and bad X-Men leaders, Xavier and Lensherr, who started as good friends and are then split emotionally over their differences at the end of the film. Good themes about isolation and not fitting in amidst the Cold War period. The cast is bad a** with James McAvoy, Kevin Bacon, Michael Fassbender, Oliver Platt and the icy January Jones. Uncredited Cameo by Hugh Jackman as Woleverine. The 2011 Scream Awards gave this one Best Fantasy Movie. X-Men fans should be happy with this one even though there are some minor nitpickings. One of the better emotional scenes was how Xavier loses the use of his legs. The budget for this film was $160M and reared in over $353M at the Box Office.

1415255,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B004LWZW42,mitchell5954,"[0, 1]","After the disappointment of X-Men the Last Stand and X-Men Origins Wolverine, I was hoping that First Class would finally get this broken franchise back on track.  With Brian Singer, the director of the first two X-Men movies, returning to direct I was anticipating a film that would make up for the last two duds.  I admit when I first saw this film I liked it okay.  However, like with Origins, as time passed, I thought about it more, and as I watched other reviews my opinion changed.  I ultimately found First Class to be a big disappointment.  It is not as bad as the Last Stand and Origins, but it is pretty close.There are a few really good things about this film.  In my opinion these few things save this film from being entirely awful.  James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender do an outstanding job as a young Professor X and Magneto.  I will even go as far as to say that McAvoy and Fassbender are as good a Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as the older versions.  Plus Kevin Bacon was very fun to watch.  I do not like the villain, himself, Shaw, but Kevin Bacon gives a great performance.  I am a fan of Kevin Bacon as an actor.  I think that he is good in anything that he is in whether it is good or bad.  Those three actors are the saving graces to this movie.  There are also some decent action scenes but I have seen better in the other X-Men films.One of the big problems with this movie is that I am not sure where this movie stands in relation with the other movies.  For a long while I confused on whether this is a prequel or a reboot.  I was leaning toward the reboot option at first.  However, this movie feels more like it is trying to be a prequel.  The film deals with the friendship between Magneto and Professor X and when they finally became enemies.  It also works in how Charles became paralyzed.  Plus if this was a reboot it is a letdown overall.  If they were starting fresh I would expect them to use the original X-Men team and this time incorporate all of the original X-Men like Cyclops, Gene, Storm, Wolverine, Beast, Angel, etc.  Instead they give us mostly mutants we have never even heard of unless you are a big comic book reader.  Not to mention that the new X-Men film, The Wolverine, takes place after The Last Stand.  So clearly this is not a reboot.However, this movie is not really a prequel either.  First Class contradicts many things set-up in not only the Last Stand and Origins, but also the first two movies.  For example, in the first X-Men they say that Professor X and Magneto created Cerebro, but here it was made by Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult).  In this movie they establish that Charles and Mystique knew each other since they were kids and grew-up together.  However, in the first three movies we have been given no indication whatsoever that they knew each other at all let alone grew-up together.  Also it has been stated in the other movies that Charles and Eric/Magneto knew each other for years before they became enemies.  In this film they only knew each other for about a week before becoming foes.  Another weird thing is that Dr. Moira (Rose Byrne) is set up as potential love interest for Charles, but she never appears again in the other films.  Those are just a few of the inconsistencies this film has with the others.  If this is a prequel then it fails as a prequel.Another problem is that the characters, other than Charles and Magneto, are not interesting at all and honestly are quite irritating.  Mystique seems to only be in this film to create forced drama with Charles, Magneto, and Hank.  I get where she is coming from, but she comes off as very whiny and a bit slutty.  Mystique was not like that at all in the other films.  The other X-Men like Banshee, Darwin, or any of the others I did not care for.  I found them boring and too whiny as well.  Hank was alright but I never cared about his plight.  Throughout the film he tries to create this serum to make himself normal.  He tells Mystique that it is better to look normal.  However their circumstances are completely different.  Mystique's mutation is throughout her body, while Hank's mutation is only his feet which he can easily hide.The villains are also very generic.  While I like Kevin Bacon, I think his character, Shaw, is a lame and idiotic villain.  His ultimate plan is one of the dumbest villain plots I have ever seen.  He wants to start a nuclear war so that mutants can take over the planet.  Mutants are not any more immune to nuclear bombs than normal people.  If nuclear war happened the mutants would die along with the humans.  It makes no sense.  Plus Shaw's accents grated on me.  Sometimes he has a German accent and other he has a Southern accent.  Both accents do not sound authentic at all.  Emma Frost I found to be lame as well.  Plus the special effect of her turning into crystal was beyond terrible.The effects for this film are quite lackluster.  Sometimes the effects are good but most times they were on par with X-Men Origins Wolverine, and that is not a good thing.  For example when Hank fully transforms into Beast he looks horrible.  The effect of Emma Frost in her crystal form is also really bad.  The Last Stand's Beast at least looked really good and was played by a better actor.  The effects in X-Men, X2, and even the Last Stand are miles better than the effects in First Class.Overall, X-Men First Class is a highly disappointing and highly overrated film.  I do not understand how this film can be so highly praised by both fans and critics.  It is currently the highest rated X-Men film on Rotten Tomatoes.  It is rated even higher than X2 which is entirely ridiculous.  First Class is not even in the same league as X2 in my opinion.  I think that the first X-Men film is also much better than this film.  It more enjoyable to watch than The Last Stand and Origins, but that is not saying much.",2,A First Class Dud!,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,5895,"['disappointment', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'X-Men',

1415262,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B004LWZW42,Monkdude,"[5, 8]","X-Men: First Class is the best X-Men movie to date and probably my favorite comic book film since The Dark Knight. This is basically another origin story (set in 1962) like the one about Wolverine a couple of years ago, but unlike that one, First Class gets nearly everything right. The story has a lot to do with the Cuban Missile Crisis, so it works on a historic, as well as, a pure action and entertainment level.What really makes it tick though is the outstanding cast. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are equally great in the roles of the younger Professor X and Magneto. They really hold the film together with their presence and excellent line delivery. Jennifer Lawrence, fresh off a Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone, does a good job with Mystique. Knowing that Kevin Bacon was playing the villain had me worried going in, but he pulled it off. The rest of the cast could have used a little more development, but seeing the dude who is a red version of Nightcrawler doing his teleportation thing is always neat. The pre-Beast guy is a whiny baby, so I couldn't wait for him to turn into the blue fur ball. I also must mention two very nice cameos from characters from the other X-Men movies. One in particular had my whole theater (which by the way was almost entirely full) laughing.The writing is pretty smart for the most part, full of good one on one conversations between McAvoy and Fassbender, while still leaving enough room for some well thought out jokes. A few scenes really stand out and are memorable. One being at a bar where Magneto goes lethal, accompanied by a superb use of music that amps up the suspense.My only problem is with the CGI. Some of it looked amazing, but at other times it looked blurry or not as polished as one would expect. Maybe I have just been spoiled with IMAX clarity, so I'll have to wait for the Blu-ray to see if it was just my theater's presentation. They also took a risk by opening with the exact same scene as the first film and having more subtitles than some kids sitting around me cared for.I can't recommend this highly enough. It's worth the high gas and the ticket prices to see it on the big screen.

All of that though can't help the film from being anything else other than average, but that in itself should be recognized as being something of an achievement.  Young mutants Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) find themselves recruited by the CIA as the nefarious Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) seeks to jump-start nuclear war in the 60s.  Along the way they encounter the vengeful Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) and assemble the first team of X-Men, well, more or less anyway.  Ignoring a number of things from X-Men Origins: Wolverine (which takes place in the timeline after this film does and features Xavier walking and Emma Frist as a teenager), First Class may be seen as a bit of a reboot I guess, and in that respect it kind of works.  What makes it as good as it is however are the performances of McAvoy and the spectacular Fassbender as the young Professor X and Magneto respectively.  January Jones is stiff and underwhelming as Emma Frost, while the young X-Men lineup is more miss than hit.

A great soundtrack comprised of both original scores and previously recorded music appropriate for the movie's setting.  How about a storyline that mixes in comedy, suspense, drama, romance and tragedy?  All of these are present in X-Men : First Class; the fifth outing in the X-Men movie franchise.  This one breaks ground in that it has an entirely new cast, most of whom are playing characters not seen in the prior movies.  Maybe the best part of this film is how it weaves the story of the first known mutants into the fabric of human history, both on the personal and global levels.  Outside of Nolan's Dark Knight, X-Men First Class is probably the other contender for best picture the year it was released.  Beside the film, this product is the standard two disk Blu-ray, where the 2nd disc is a digital copy instead of the traditional DVD copy.

1415278,A12FLZREV32JOP,B004LWZW42,Noelle Eiram,"[7, 14]","Scene: 1960s. Cold War.As Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) hunts down former Nazis, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) studies at Oxford. Erik spent World War II in a concentration camp. Charles lived in luxury, but his parents were never around. His company was a girl about his age named Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). Former Nazi Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) plots to start World War III, so Erik, Charles, Raven, and a rag-tag group join together to stop him.Oh, yeah, and they have superpowers. They're mutated humans, and few know of their existence. Those who do know tend to fear and loathe them, making most mutants feel alone and discriminated against. METAPHOR.If I had gone in expecting a James Bond film, I might have had a better idea of what to expect. This prequel to the other X-Men films had possibilities. We know from later films that Charles and Erik become leaders with opposing philosophies, even as they appear to share a genuine affection. How fun could it be to see their relationship develop?The answer is pretty fun but also very stupid.What they got wrong:DialogueSome of the dialogue is cringe worthy and unbelievably clich&eacute;. How many times have we heard the phrase, ""Who are you and what have you done with (etc.)"" or ""God help us all?"" This may be paying homage to the past, but this knowledge doesn't make the horrendous lines any easier on the ears.Humans/Non-mutants/MugglesMutants are putting their lives on the line for lowly humans, but the big question here is, will the humans ever accept the mutants? Is it really worth saving a people who may very well turn against you? The film attempts to answer that question and show ambiguity by making almost every human character grating, irrationally stupid, and self-centered. Several minor characters (mostly humans) deliver their terrible lines in an especially wooden manner. This makes the stakes feel remarkably low. That's quite an accomplishment considering the stakes are World War III.HistoryObviously, this is an alternate history. However, First Class is no Inglourious Basterds, a complex, satirical take on World War II. This film portrays two terrifying time periods in history, the Holocaust and the Cold War, with an offensive mixture of melodrama and lightheartedness. A figure resembling the sickening Nazi doctor Josef Mengele resembles a James Bond villain, gleefully shooting down an innocent Jewish woman. Was anyone else uncomfortable with this?Race Relations (Spoiler Alert)The film states its message about fifty times: be proud of your identity, no matter what your appearance. Yet the only African American man (Edi Gathegi, potentially interesting) in the film is one of only two mutants to be killed. The other is a Nazi.ConsistencyAs is expected, there are several moments that make no sense. You might find yourself asking, why aren't they moving when they are in grave danger? Those questions are far less important than several puzzling allegiance shifts. Let's just say a few characters who appear to be horrified when witnessing mass murder somehow become smug accomplices.What they got right:StyleThe design department had great fun with generic but iconic clothes and music of the 1960s. Prepare for turtlenecks and short skirts (and, because this is a comic book movie, cleavage).Erik and CharlesThe relationship between Erik and Charles is quite touching. Charles (dubbed Professor X) is a witty, confident, and believably inspiring leader. McAvoy is likable and surprisingly hilarious in the role. Charles uses his telepathic ability to help Erik (Magneto) control his unbalanced emotions. Erik uses his ability to mentally manipulate metal to pulverize his enemies. Erik is insightful, ruthless, and disturbed. Intense as always, Fassbender is engaging whether terrorizing bad-guys, fighting the darkness within, or giving acute advice to younger mutants.MutantsRaven (later named Mystique) has a fairly nice story as a blue shapeshifter embarrassed by her natural appearance. Nicholas Hoult does well as a scientist who is ashamed of his fancy feet, capturing both the character's diffidence and gruffer side. Scenes involving mutant abilities are in some ways superior to the other X-Men films because characters use their powers to full effect (i.e. they do not unnecessarily backflip or punch others when they could shoot them with lasers). On the whole, the action is quite entertaining and certainly one of the best aspects of this film.VillainsKevin Bacon has fun as the nefarious Shaw, and his trio of suave baddies remains confident and calm in every situation. The serene Emma Frost (January Jones) is a telepath who wears mostly undies and can turn her skin into a protective veneer of diamonds. The other two henchmen have a very small amount of screen time. One has at most five lines. The other has none. Still, Riptide (Alex Gonzalez) has an amusing ability to keep his hair and outfit perfectly in place while creating tornadoes, and Azazel (Jason Flemyng) bears a demonic appearance, possesses stunning assassination skills, and can teleport in a burst of flames. (Can anyone blame him for joining the villains? Who would trust a guy who looks like the devil?)StoryThere is an actual arc, including a climax featuring several satisfying action sequences and some emotional resolution. There's even a little tragedy and surprise.ConclusionX-Men: First Class should be enjoyable for anyone who has followed the X-Men series. It's an entertaining film which improves as it progresses. Unfortunately, it is not also a good film.",3,Two and a half stars but I guess I'll round up,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,5568,"['Scene', '1960s', 'Cold', 'War.As', 'Erik', 'Lehnsherr', 'Michael',

Though, as a superhero movie, this one had it all and did it right, it screwed up the whole Xmen legend so badly, it wasn't funny! Here's Raven being childhood friends with Charles Xavier. Here's Banshee as a teenager without a trace of an Irish brogue....here's Moira McTaggart as an American CIA agent and NOT a Scottish biologist! Here's Alex Summers popping up almost ten years too early.....ANGEL as a petite young WOMAN with insect wings instead of the bird-winged fella in Xmen 3....No Iceman, no Cyclops, no Marvel Girl, and Magneto and Xavier working together twenty years too early. Sebastian Shaw turned up VERY late in the Xmen mythos and so did Emma Frost. And where did Darwin come from??However, something about John McAvoy's and Michael Fassbender's acting, the cocky, over-confident manner that Kevin Bacon uses to parlay Sebastian Shaw, (a role [[I]] never would have picked him for!) and a well-written script make this one of the more enjoyable superhero movies since ""Iron Man'. If you ask me, I think McAvoy ought to get the Xavier role for good, for he does it MUCH better than Patrick Stewart.  Likewise, Fassbender is a quantum improvement over Ian McKellen. It's probably the acting that sets this production apart from both the eariler Xmen movies AND most other superhero flicks. The actors seem thoroughly convinced they are whom they're playing, as fantastic as those characters may be. The writers, (who REALLY ought to check their source material more thoroughly,) also put the powers that the individual heroes have to good use, as well as putting good dialogue in the mouths of McAvoy and company.It's also a testament to the writers' talents that the movie works even WITH the continuity discrepancies between known Xmen legend and what appears on the screen. It's a shame they were probably a LITTLE too conscious of the fact that most people who would see the movie would have almost NO working knowledge of the Xmen of the comics, and hence, wouldn't complain. However, it WOULD be nice, if, like the people behind ""Daredevil"", they had cleaved a little closer to what history had been laid down about the characters....Highly enjoyable, nonetheless....",4,Liked it....,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2213,"['reservations', 'Though', 'superhero', 'movie', 'one', 'had', 'did', 'right', 'screwed', 'up', 'whole', 'Xmen', 'legend', 'so', 'badly', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Here', 'Raven', 'being', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Here', 'Banshee', 'teenager', 'trace', 'Irish', 'brogue', 'Moira', 'McTaggart', 'American', 'CIA', 'agent', 'NOT', 'Scottish', 'biologist', 'Here', 'Alex', 'Summers', 'popping', 'up', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'too', 'early', 'petite', 'young', 'WOMAN', 'insect', 'wings', 'instead', 'bird-winged', 'fella', 'Xmen', '3', '.No', 'Iceman', 'Cyclops', 'Marvel', 'Girl', 'Magneto', 'Xavier', 'working', 'together', 'twenty', 'years', 'too', 'early', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'turned', 'up', 'VERY', 'late', 'Xmen', 'mythos', 'so', 'did', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'where', 'did', 'Darwin', 'come', 'However', 'something', 'John', 'McAvoy', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'acting', 'cocky', 'over-confident', 'manner', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'parlay', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'role', '[', '[', ']', ']', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'well-written', 'script', 'make', 'one', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'superhero', 'movies', 'Iron', 'Man', 'ask', 'think', 'McAvoy', 'ought', 'get', 'Xavier', 'role', 'good', 'MUCH', 'better', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Likewise', 'Fassbender', 'quantum', 'improvement', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'probably', 'acting', 'production', 'apart', 'eariler', 'Xmen', 'movies', 'AND', 'most', 'other', 'superhero', 'flicks', 'actors', 'seem', 'thoroughly', 'convinced', 'are', 'whom', ""'re"", 'playing', 'as', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'writers', 'who', 'REALLY', 'ought', 'check', 'source', 'material', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'also', 'put', 'powers', 'individual', 'heroes', 'have', 'good', 'use', 'as', 'well', 'putting', 'good', 'dialogue', 'mouths', 'McAvoy', 'company.It', 'also', 'testament', 'writers', 'talents', 'movie', 'even', 'WITH', 'continuity', 'discrepancies', 'known', 'Xmen', 'legend', 'what', 'screen', 'shame', 'were', 'probably', 'LITTLE', 'too', 'conscious', 'fact', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'see', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'almost', 'NO', 'working', 'knowledge', 'Xmen', 'comics', 'hence', 'would', ""n't"", 'complain', 'However', 'WOULD', 'be', 'nice', 'people', 'Daredevil', 'had', 'cleaved', 'little', 'closer', 'what', 'history', 'had', 'been', 'laid', 'down', 'characters', '.Highly', 'enjoyable', 'nonetheless']",N/A

Mixing comic book fantasy with actual history can be a tricky thing. But Matthew Vaughn admirably juggles all his story elements to a fault, with a playful wink here & there (note: the cameo from a famous mutant...guess who?). The production is top-notch, with some very stylized 1962 set pieces (including some vintage TV footage from The Cuban Missile Crisis), some pretty awesome special effects (Magneto pulling an entire submarine out of the water was quite a sight), and a great cast. James McAvoy & Michael Fassbinder do incredibly fine jobs of actually making the roles their own without muddying up the work left by old pros Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen, whose characters of Prof. Charles Xavier & Erik ""Magneto"" Lensherr the film revolves around. The prequel deftly manages to explain how Xavier & Magneto start off as friends (from very different backgrounds), then as their conflict with humanity deepens, begin taking different roads on the ""mutants & humans"" issue. Here, we not only see how a young Henry McCoy ""accidentally"" mutates further into the hairy, fanged Beast, but young mutants are introduced whom we've never seen before, such as Havoc (Cyclop's brother) & the sonic-wailing Banshee. With a large cast of characters, there's always the danger of certain ones getting a raw deal on screen time. But here, each one gets his moment to shine. Add to this the measured menace of a good villain (Kevin Bacon as an energy-absorbing Nazi scientist who cruelly manipulated & tortured a young Magneto in his experiments)rounding out the cast, and the film is just plain fun to watch.Marvel Studios, keep those good X-men films coming!",5,An expertly handled X-men prequel,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,1729,"['was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'new', 'intrepretation', 'X-men', 'franchise', 'Mixing', 'comic', 'book', 'fantasy', 'actual', 'history', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', 'thing', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'admirably', 'story', 'elements', 'fault', 'playful', 'wink', 'here', 'there', 'note', 'cameo', 'famous', 'mutant', 'guess', 'who', 'production', 'top-notch', 'very', 'stylized', '1962', 'set', 'pieces', 'including', 'vintage', 'TV', 'footage', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'Magneto', 'pulling', 'entire', 'submarine', 'water', 'was', 'quite', 'sight', 'great', 'cast', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Michael', 'Fassbinder', 'do', 'incredibly', 'fine', 'jobs', 'actually', 'making', 'roles', 'own', 'muddying', 'up', 'work', 'left', 'old', 'pros', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'characters', 'Prof.', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Erik', 'Magneto', 'Lensherr', 'film', 'around', 'prequel', 'deftly', 'explain', 'how', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'start', 'off', 'friends', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'then', 'conflict', 'humanity', 'deepens', 'begin', 'taking', 'different', 'roads', 'mutants', 'humans', 'issue', 'Here', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'how', 'young', 'Henry', 'McCoy', 'accidentally', 'further', 'hairy', 'fanged', 'Beast', 'young', 'mutants', 'are', 'introduced', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'such', 'Havoc', 'Cyclop', 'brother', 'sonic-wailing', 'Banshee', 'large', 'cast', 'characters', 'always', 'danger', 'certain', 'ones', 'getting', 'raw', 'deal', 'screen', 'time', 'here', 'one', 'moment', 'shine', 'Add', 'measured', 'menace', 'good', 'villain', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'energy-absorbing', 'Nazi', 'scientist', 'who', 'cruelly', 'manipulated', 'tortured', 'young', 'Magneto', 'experiments', 'rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'watch.Marvel', 'Studios', 'keep', 'good', 'X-men', 'films', 'coming']",N/A

1415324,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B004LWZW42,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[2, 3]","First, I will say that I am not one to get overly upset with the alterations to character history. So long as the essence of the character remains true I think fans need to be (somewhat) open minded. That is to say, I don't want to see Batman pointlessly using guns or Spider-man being carefree without the underlying burden of his great responsibility, etc. Changing timelines or events can be seen as eXcusable if it allows a more cohesive story. So leaving all eXpectations other than core character traits at the door what can one eXpect from the latest X-men film?It's become quite difficult to give honest reviews of these (comic book) films. The problem is that so many have been bombarded at us in the last decade, many from the same franchise's, that it has become difficult for any individual film to be judged on its own. Comparisons become unavoidable.X-men (2000) was a new experience when it first arrived, it had its flaws, but before then nobody had seen a large budget attempt at an ensemble cast superhero movie. It stood out in that regard as a first attempt. Now there is no first attempt eXcuse, people start to judge these films more harshly because they eXpect the filmmakers to learn from previous attempts. That said, X-men: First Class IS a good film.Further, if you ignore highly regarded comic book movies such as X2, Spider-man 2 and The Dark Knight, this film is eXcellent as a comic book movie. Especially if viewed as a first entry in a new series. It can only be said to suffer the same issues that all first entries in these franchises do - it has too much to do for any of it to feel completely natural and we aren't entirely used to the version of the world being presented yet.In an attempt to counteract these usual issues the CIA is used as an easy way to explain certain otherwise difficult to explain plot points. They want to keep the story moving and have limited runtime, understood, but it took getting used to for me to accept that Charles and Eric were basically given Cerebro and the Blackbird already built (even if here it is Beast who designed them).Also, Mystique meeting Charles plays somewhat expository, along the same line there are several other moments that can be said to be shoved in simply because they need to happen, but they are telling so much story with so many new characters that these issues are largely forgiven.The largest fault anyone could find in this film is that Charles and Eric were played so well anyone would wish for more scenes with them and exploring their friendship, especially given that this was the one film they had a chance to do so before certain events unfolded.In the POSITIVES (which do outway any negatives), Eric and Charles are played so incredibly well. Fassbender in particular helps one see how this film could easily have been Origins: Magneto while McAvoy brings a welcomed boyish charm to Xavier (though I would have loved to see more of the character's motivations explained or explored by the script). All the actors playing the first class are perfectly cast in their roles. The powers are showcased nicely and action is found throughout in original set pieces that feel fresh. CGI is well done and at least isn't as heavily relied on as say Origins Wolverine. They tell an epic story and the sixties setting helps the film amazingly, JFK clips are used seamlessly to aid in this (Vaughn says he wants the sequel to open with the JFK assassination). What really sells this film is the amazing story that the events are all tied around. There are also some genuine good laughs and many in-jokes that don't detract from story at all.The final set piece is where the film really reaches its best moments, despite any arguable missteps in getting there, it truly grips the audience member/X-fan and all the pieces come into play for what has to happen in the most terrific and the most tragic of ways (despite Mystique's growth being rushed). The final moments of that set piece are indeed the film truly living its full potential in rebooting this franchise.Overall I give it 4.5 stars as a comic book movie and 4 stars as a film on its own. I want to leave room for the promise of a much improved sequel. It is undoubtedly one of the better comic book movies that will come out this summer (if not the best) and attempts admirable depth for a summer blockbuster, despite not quite finding that ""place between rage and serenity"" (as Charles tells Eric). Get out there and see it if you are a fan, it's worlds better than the cluster of plots that bogged down both X3 and X-men Origins: Wolverine.

The former, of which the latest installment falls, feature marvelous character development, good acting, and impressive special effects.As is commonly known about the 2011 film, the film offers an introduction into the origins of the X-Men's origins, played against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis,.  The cast is headed by James McAlvoy as Charles Xavier/Professor X and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. Both actors excel in their roles, adding their own distinctive acting styles to characters originally played by Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellan in the previous X-men trilogy.  Fassbender is exceptionally good in the early scenes when he is attempting to discover the whereabouts of the film's supervillain, Sebastian Shaw, played with delicious wickedness by Kevin Bacon.Jennifer Lawrence makes for a very sympathetic Raven/Mystique while Rose Byrne is quite good as the CIA agent who assists Xavier and company in their attempt to thwart Shaw's plans.The special effects are visually stunning, especially during the climactic confrontation between U.S. and Russian ships.

1415328,A39W3263A9HCMN,B004LWZW42,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[2, 4]","**WARNING: SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW***I grew up with the X Men cartoons- ah, the childhood memories. I remember reading the comics and wishing I was as cool as Magneto, Wolverine, Beast, etc. I remember when X Men 1 came out... and oh man it was F'ing cool. I wanted to be like Wolverine. I loved that Cyclops' name was Scott. I got it on VHS for Christmas and I was 9 years old. I think I nearly wore out the tape!!!X2 was probably the best of the original trilogy, in my opinion. It was the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd pleasing. When X3 came out, I was excited... but was so disappointed when I went and saw it. What happened? Who were all these random mutants??? What purpose did they serve? Why was all this story crammed in? And X Men Origins ran the franchise even further into the ground. Quite frankly I was done with the X Men franchise by then.And then, ANOTHER X Men movie gets made. Oh dear. A PREQUEL???? George Lucas made 3 tragedies that were prequels. But wait... Michael Fassbender is in it, as is James MacAvoy!!! And it's directed by Matthew Vaughn. That's when I decided, OK, I'll start taking this movie seriously now. And then I saw the trailer... I was excited... This is the X Men I want to see.And believe me. This movie ROCKED. Me being the geek I am, I went and saw it today. And trust me, it does NOT disappoint! X2 was my favorite of the series, but it looks like I have to reconsider. I'm not kidding, this movie is what I wanted to see after X2.This is, as I stated, a prequel. The first half may disorient you a little- it focuses mainly on Erik and Charles. We learn of Erik's childhood in Nazi-occupied Poland, and how he came to terms with his magnetic powers. Whereas Charles, the man with clearly the better childhood, comes to terms with his mind reading abilities. We follow them through thick and thin- Charles' academic ventures and relationship with Raven and Erik's vengeful outings. We do see them meet, one night when Erik unsuccessfully tries to stop Sebastian Shaw, the film's villain, and his crew.This leads to the meetings with a few Youth with mutant powers. Raven, who can turn into another person easily is automatically in, we have a scientist with feet that can grab, a woman with firefly wings, A man with a sonar, a man who can adapt, another man who can wreak havoc with some destructive powers. This leads to Charles' creation of a school for these people, so they can prepare for their part in the Cuban Missile Crisis- a crisis fronted by Shaw.Honestly... wow. I can't believe I actually liked a new X Men movie for once. At 132 minutes, not a single moment is wasted. The movie moves at an effective enough pace- equal amounts of action and character are to be found. There is a lot of great humour too, and the climax in Cuba is one intense nail biter. And they managed not to screw up the character arcs- except the fact that Charles loses his walking ability in the 60s yet at the beginning of X3 he can be seen standing. But that movie fracked lots of arcs up anyways, so I don't count it.The acting is PHENOMENAL. Fassbender gives quite possibly the performance of a lifetime. His controlled rage and mannerisms are just... BRILLIANT. He manages to nail the role completely and carry the film in the palm of his hand. MacAvoy surprised me big time here as well and excelled as Charles. And Kevin Bacon was fantastic as Shaw. Honestly I can't think of a single bad performance, all were great.In short, this film is the movie that defines ""Awesome summer movie"". It is the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd-pleasing. Even if you don't like X-Men you will still love this movie. By far the best movie of 2011!!!OVERALL: 10/10PROS:-Awesome script-Lots of action-Amazing performances-Great pacing-Not a second wastedCONS:-...uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh...",5,The movie we should have gotten after X2,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,3822,"['**WARNING', 'SPOILERS', 'IN', 'THIS', 'REVIEW***I', 'grew', 'up', 'X', 'Men', 'cartoons-', 'ah', 'childhood', 'memories', 'remember', 'reading', 'comics', 'wishing', 'was', 'as', 'cool', 'Magneto', 'Wolverine', 'Beast', 'etc', 'remember', 'when', 'X', 'Men', '1', 'came', 'out', 'oh', 'man', 'was', ""F'ing"", 'cool', 'wanted', 'be', 'Wolverine', 'loved', 'Cyclops', 'name', 'was', 'Scott', 'got', 'VHS', 'Christmas', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'think', 'nearly', 'wore', 'out', 'tape', 'X2', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'original', 'trilogy', 'opinion', 'was', 'perfect', 'mix', 'fanservice', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'When', 'X3', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'excited', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'when', 'went', 'saw', 'What', 'happened', 'Who', 'were', 'random', 'mutants', 'What', 'purpose', 'did', 'serve', 'Why', 'was', 'story', 'crammed', 'X', 'Men', 'Origins', 'ran', 'franchise', 'even', 'further', 'ground', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'was', 'done', 'X', 'Men', 'franchise', 'then.And', 'then', 'ANOTHER', 'X', 'Men', 'movie', 'made', 'Oh', 'dear', 'PREQUEL', 'George', 'Lucas', 'made', '3', 'tragedies', 'were', 'prequels', 'wait', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'James', 'MacAvoy', 'directed', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'when', 'decided', 'OK', ""'ll"", 'start', 'taking', 'movie', 'seriously', 'now', 'then', 'saw', 'trailer', 'was', 'excited', 'X', 'Men', 'want', 'see.And', 'believe', 'movie', 'ROCKED', 'Me', 'being', 'geek', 'am', 'went', 'saw', 'today', 'trust', 'NOT', 'disappoint', 'X2', 'was', 'favorite', 'series', 'have', 'reconsider', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'movie', 'what', 'wanted', 'see', 'X2.This', 'stated', 'prequel', 'first', 'half', 'may', 'disorient', 'little-', 'mainly', 'Erik', 'Charles', 'learn', 'Erik', 'childhood', 'Nazi-occupied', 'Poland', 'how', 'came', 'terms', 'magnetic', 'powers', 'Whereas', 'Charles', 'man', 'clearly', 'better', 'childhood', 'terms', 'mind', 'reading', 'abilities', 'follow', 'thick', 'thin-', 'Charles', 'academic', 'ventures', 'relationship', 'Raven', 'Erik', 'vengeful', 'outings', 'do', 'see', 'meet', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'Erik', 'unsuccessfully', 'stop', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'film', 'villain', 'crew.This', 'meetings', 'few', 'Youth', 'mutant', 'powers', 'Raven', 'who', 'can', 'turn', 'person', 'easily', 'automatically', 'have', 'scientist', 'feet', 'can', 'grab', 'woman', 'firefly', 'wings', 'man', 'sonar', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'adapt', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'destructive', 'powers', 'Charles', 'creation', 'school', 'people', 'can', 'prepare', 'part', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis-', 'crisis', 'fronted', 'Shaw.Honestly', 'wow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'actually', 'liked', 'new', 'X', 'Men', 'movie', 'once', '132', 'minutes', 'not', 'single', 'moment', 'wasted', 'movie', 'effective', 'enough', 'pace-', 'equal', 'amounts', 'action', 'character', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'lot', 'great', 'humour', 'too', 'climax', 'Cuba', 'one', 'intense', 'nail', 'biter', 'managed', 'not', 'screw', 'up', 'character', 'arcs-', 'fact', 'Charles', 'walking', 'ability', '60s', 'yet', 'beginning', 'X3', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'standing', 'movie', 'fracked', 'lots', 'arcs', 'anyways', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'it.The', 'acting', 'PHENOMENAL', 'Fassbender', 'quite', 'possibly', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'controlled', 'rage', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'just', 'BRILLIANT', 'nail', 'role', 'completely', 'carry', 'film', 'palm', 'hand', 'MacAvoy', 'surprised', 'big', 'time', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'excelled', 'Charles', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Shaw', 'Honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'bad', 'performance', 'were', 'great.In', 'short', 'film', 'movie', 'Awesome', 'summer', 'movie', 'perfect', 'mix', 'fanservice', 'crowd-pleasing', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'X-Men', 'will', 'still', 'love', 'movie', 'far', 'best', 'movie', '2011', 'OVERALL', '10/10PROS', '-Awesome', 'script-Lots', 'action-Amazing', 'performances-Great', 'pacing-Not', 'second', 'wastedCONS', 'uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh']",N/A

I could understand some of the characters that were chosen to be in the movie are how they were able to stay so fit and active and later decades(Mystique) but at least one left me dumbfounded and that's the character of Havok. Havok or Alex Summers as I'm sure many comic fans know is supposed to be the younger brother of Scott Summers(Cyclops),so unless they had Cyclops alive and older in this time era then the writers botched that scenario in their script somewhat. Also would be the introduction of Emma Frost or the White Queen and Hank McCoy(Beast) and Sean Cassidy(Banshee),but I guess since two of these characters weren't introduced in any of the three previous X-men movies or the Wolverine movie that the producers decided to use them in this movie.  Despite that little mishap overall the movie gives fans of the series what they wanted the history of the relationship between Charles Xavier and Eric Lensherr before the tragic animosity that would come between the former friends and colleges and of course plenty of action and fights.

Xavier believes they will and should live WITH humans while Erik,now called Magneto,believes the mutants will be a source of contention for humans and that the mutants should strike back and rule the human race.They part enemies.The film ends as Xavier opens a school for mutants in a secret location and Erik breaks a mutant previously captured,who worked closely with Dr Schmidt,out of CIA headquarters.The action in this film is really non stop and all the cast does a magnificent job in their respective roles.The film conveniently centres around some actual events of the early 60s and seamlessly blends them into the plot.I was surprised to see Kevin Bacon in the movie,who I thought brought alot of depth to his role as Schmidt.Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include three featurettes on the film.A highly recommended film in the X men franchise.I dare say this might be arguably,so far,the best film yet!*You may be surprised that I was surprised to see Bacon in the film.So with your permission,here is a brief insight into how I review movies.Unless I actually see the film in theatres(which these days is extremely rare),I have NO preconceived notions or any ideas of the films plot and I NEVER follow any trade papers or press on newly released movies.So when I get a DVD to review,it is without any outside influences and I'm seeing it for the first time.That way I can say that I am truly writing from MY heart and head,not someone else's.My opinion will not always jibe with another reviewer but

Crawford,"[1, 2]","As a long-time fan of the comic, I am consistently wowed with the quality of the x-men films, particularly the first trilogy, which is the best adaptation of comic characters for the screen I have ever seen.  Sure, this and Wolverine are not quite as good, but they are definitely in the same league.Beyond a wonderful story, the greatest fun of this film is to see the relationships between the early characters, many of whom become the deadliest of adversaries 30 years or so later.  I was surprised to learn that Xavier and Mystique essentially grew up together, she as an adopted and beloved sister who wanted him to become her husband; after his rejection, she almost got together with Hank, then ultimately chose Magneto when he insisted she appear as her natural self.  Meanwhile, the background and character of Magneto are fully developed, from his incarceration as a Jew in Hitler's Germany to his enlistment by a mysterious psychopath as played to perfection by Kevin Bacon.  Once he mastered his powers with Xavier's help, Magneto comes to treat others as he himself was treated.  Finally, the relationship - like warring but loving brothers - between Xavier and Magneto, representing the two poles that the mutant community must choose.  It is superbly acted, mostly by relative unknowns.  I hope that this will spawn its own series.The plot is also very engaging.  Placing the mutants smack in the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis, we learn the hidden history behind not just its inception, but its resolution and the terrible dangers that were avoided are great imaginative reconstructions.  There are also some great new characters with unusual powers.Yep, this will have to be added to our collection.

1415348,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B004LWZW42,Russ Nickel,"[7, 10]","Not since 2003 have we been graced with a truly good X-Men movie, but it seems the curse of the Wolverine has been lifted, for X-Men: First Class is a film that has evolved beyond its ancestors, a film that is equal parts entertaining and compelling, that portrays relatable, human (technically non-human) characters while still placing the fate of the world in their hands. Somehow, amidst a profusion of by-the-numbers superhero movies, a mutant has been born, and its power far exceeds that of the average cinematic experience.One of the main reasons this film succeeds is because the CGI battles take a back seat to more poignant scenes about mutants grappling with their place in the world. The villain Shaw (Kevin Bacon) believes humans and mutants will never be able to coexist, and since his power allows him to absorb energy, he attempts to provoke Russia and America into nuclear war. In one fell swoop, the war will wipe out a huge percentage of humanity and at the same time provide Shaw with nearly limitless power. The backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis is a parallel that casts a thought-provoking light on the difficulty of coexistence. For once, an X-Men movie's plot is poignant and metaphorically effective.[Mini Spoiler Alert] And it thankfully chooses not to focus on Wolverine for a fifth time. After eleven long years spent watching Wolverine carcajou his way through his problems, it was a nice change of pace to have Hugh Jackman's role cut down to about 15 seconds of screen time--just long enough to drop the PG-13's one F-bomb (and it's a great one). Other than that, however, we're met with an entirely new cast who manage to make us truly feel for these mutants. [End Mini Spoiler Alert]James McAvoy steals the show as a young Charles Xavier. He's a walking, charming, drinking, womanizing piece of brain who just so happens to be a telepath. It's nice to see that he's not that different from us, really. The so-wise-he's-untouchable Yoda version of Professor X from the prior films is gone, and in his place is someone you feel you could get along with at a party, though he'd probably beat you in a chugging contest. I never truly understood Xavier's idealism before, but McAvoy shows us that doing the right thing can be a struggle. Xavier feels what all others feel, remembers what they remember. When he reads Magneto's mind, he is filled with just as much rage, and yet he is somehow able to still walk the path of righteousness. When I noticed how deeply I was reading into his character, it became apparent that this film was incredibly well written. How do you write dialogue for someone who is able to empathize completely with everyone he meets? Personally, I don't know (and as an aspiring screenwriter, this distresses me), but these guys nailed it.While there are epic stakes and CGI mutant powers aplenty, this film is mostly about the relationship between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr a.k.a. Magneto. Luckily, Michael Fassbender does just as well with Magneto as McAvoy does with the Professor. The two have a genuine rapport, and Fassbender perfectly straddles the line between evil and relatable. After witnessing his life story, you can't really begrudge him his actions. His parents' death at the hands of the Nazis left him broken, a man for whom ""peace was never an option.""The struggle to find inner peace seemed to affect all mutants, and while it was deftly handled for the most part, I found Beast's romance with Mystique to be uncharacteristically weak. For a film so good at delving into the hearts of its characters, I was disappointed to see their love story reduced to nothing more than a high-school level clich&eacute;. I get it, you're both blue and neither of you can accept what you've become. But if the civil rights movement has taught us anything, it's that you're not required to have sex with people who are the same color as you. Branch out a little, blue folk. Then again, this was the early 1960s, so maybe they were just taking care to avoid any anachronisms. Either way, their potential relationship was nothing more than Mystique fawning over Beast with endless doe-eyed gazes just because he also didn't fit in. I guess he's probably into the doe-eyed thing though--deer are beasts, right?Poorly executed romantic entanglements aside, Mystique still brought a good deal of heart to this film. One of my favorite aspects of the X-Men franchise is that Magneto the villain and Xavier the hero share a close bond. Good and evil are more subtle here, shades of gray drawn with the ink of human emotion, rather than unrealistic characters who embody pure justice and malice. X-Men: First Class delivered on this complicated relationship more successfully than I could have thought possible. It perfectly portrayed the way two groups could be enemies in intent and method, but friends on a personal level. It was in this way that Mystique's presence was so compelling, for she and Xavier are foster siblings, yet in the end, she sides with Magneto, unable to come to terms with the world Xavier is working toward, a world in which mutants may forever remain downtrodden. The two siblings still love each other, but they are unable to reconcile their differences, and their parting is a touching moment.It's a great movie! Real issues, real relationships, real badass. I never thought I'd like another X-Men film, but it turns out I was wrong. The actors nail these roles, and the script is fantastic. It actually gets you to care about its characters in a way that no superhero film ever has.Score: 4/5How did a bunch of drunk kids pick perfect character aliases first try every time? Mutants with powers that make physics look like a set of suggestions is one thing, but there weren't any mutants with the power of overwhelming creativity on the team, were there? WERE THERE? Ok, sorry.

1415358,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B004LWZW42,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[1, 1]","First Impressions:Director Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass) tones down the violence a bit in this excellent rendition of the origins of the X-Men -- teenagers and young adults who struggle with who they are and their strangeness, unacceptable in society.  Do you protect society or do you embrace your destiny and get rid of the ""lesser species?""I mean with all these differences that it's best to get into a group of like-minded people with similar rejection and upset and also similar goals and purposes.It's a story of two young men and how they deal with their differences.  One, Charles Xavier, who was brought up in a rich household, has known the best schools, the best social status and knows what women are thinking before they can speak.  Wow, the power to be a lady's man, who would'a though?The other end of the spectrum is a young man who in anger can bend steel with his bare brains.  He witnesses the Nazis and their Jewish experimentation including the death of his mother.  And he meets a man, Sebastian, who forms Eric into the image of a true superman.  He discusses not so much the blonde, Aryan look but rather the evolutionary form of Man.  And of course he has the answer:1950s DNA!Use nuclear power to create mutants and thereby get rid of normal people.  A mad plan to say the least -- something out of a 1950s science fiction film.  Remember ""Them"" or ""The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms"" when monsters rose from nuclear energy?Now before you criticize me for saying the plot for X-Men has more DNA with a 1950s science fiction movie, what saves this film is the acting.  I was convinced that these misunderstood teens really were at the threshold of something greater.The use of the Cuban Missile Crisis was great as a back-drop.The special effects were great with the missiles lobbing here and there.  Professor X figured that once they saved the humans from nuclear war that he would be cheered and helped.  Instead, as Magneto predicted, they would be hunted down and destroyed.Themes:Unlike some other comic book films that were so involved in canon that the message got lost amidst the explosions and action, X-Men First Class does several things.  As touched on earlier, the awkward, misunderstood teen rejected by society.  The rich Xavier and the poor Eric, both sharing a commonality despite their differences in class.  The Nazi theme of eugenics morphed into exterminating a perceived threat, a race of men that are considered ""different.""Bottom Line:The film was violent enough to satisfy those who like action in their films, but kept within the PG rating -- just!  And the interplay between the characters was interesting and enchanting in many ways.  Finally the scriptwriters wrote for the common viewer rather than catering to the fanboy, although both types of viewers will be enjoying this film.  The film is up there with Batman Begins and Spiderman 2.  Wonderful.",5,Was Not Expecting An Excellent Film!

The original Batman movies should have stopped after one.  The Fantastic Four should have stopped the minute Jessica Alba was cast.  But leave it to X-Men to finally get it right after 5 tries.Not that the first four movies were bad.  X-Men 1 and 2 are actually decent.  Wolverine is campy, but still fun.  X-Men 3 barely survives Kelsey Grammer in a fuzzy blue gorilla suit.  But X-Men First Class is in a, uh, category of its own.There are a few reasons why it works so well.  Good action, fun characters, jokes, a couple awesome cameos.  But I think the biggest reason is that it is set in the 60s.  No Austin Powers here (though January Jones as Emma Frost does a pretty great impression of a Fem-bot).  This is Cold War all the way.  This can lead to some anachronistic moments.  After leaving their cutting edge genetics lab on a futuristic hover jet, the X-Men are forced to watch JFK give updates on a static black-and-white television.Still, it's awesome to have a real president overseeing these things for once.  Using the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, the filmmakers recast a chess match between superpowers as a chess match between super powers.  The U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. may have their differences, but pretty much everyone agrees that Kevin Bacon is pure evil.Bacon plays the mutant villain Sebastian Shaw, whose main super power is that he can link himself to any movie actor in six movies or less.  He can also absorb energy.  This makes him pretty much unstoppable, except for one weak point, and it has nothing to do with his bushy sideburns (Kevin Bacon can rock smarmy facial hair like nobody's business).  It's up to Magneto and Professor X to find his Achilles Heel and exploit it.Yes, Magneto and Professor X are a team in this movie, and while it doesn't exactly culminate with a lightsaber battle on Mustafar, you know it can't end well.  This is a far more violent movie then we're used to from X-Men.  Comic book movies tend to involve lots of action, but rarely do you grasp the damage to human life.  X-Men First Class isn't gory, but it does have some brutal murders.  Most of them involve Magneto, whose ability to rip fillings from other people's teeth and thrust knives into their chests from across the room makes him a little unsettling.  Another mutant can grab hold of average people and teleport them a mile into the sky.  Then he drops them.  This is a far cry from the horrors of Superman II, where the biggest danger was in having your bus tip over.There's a dark side even to the good guys, and many of the mutants are not above using their sexuality as a manipulation tactic.  Angel makes a living as an exotic dancer.  Emma Frost has no problem telepathically simulating a make-out session.  Even the non-mutant CIA officer strips down to her underwear to sneak into a nightclub.  Give Mystique some credit.  Whereas everyone just assumed that Rebecca Romijn would give her performance sans clothes, Jennifer Lawrence (as the younger version) at least feels uncomfortable walking around in full blue nakedness.  Let's face it, when even Professor X is dropping the same genetic-theme pick-up line on every hottie at the bar, you've definitely crossed into new X-Men territory.If the movie falters anywhere, it's in bringing back that ridiculous blue gorilla suit.  Nicholas Hoult's character undergoes a transformation from a guy with big feet to The Beast, later (earlier) played by Kelsey Grammer.  While some comic book costumes look good on screen, this one is never gonna work.  He looks like a werewolf smurf, and might better off chasing Gargamel's cat through a magical candy forest.  A better solution would have been to show the beginnings of Beast's transformation, then to have him flee the movie out of shame, which would have been entirely within character.All told, X-Men First Class has catapulted itself to the upper echelon of comic book movies, into the heady space occupied by Dark Knight and Iron Man.

1415365,A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,B004LWZW42,"Shannon L. Yarbrough ""Shannon L. Yarbrough""","[1, 1]","Though Bryan Singer put his stamp on this movie as an Executive Producer, it's Matthew Vaughn the director (2010's Kick-Ass) who deserves every bit of credit for breathing new life into the X-men comics with this outstanding ""First Class"" prequel which takes us back to when Charles Xavier could walk and the X-Men were first coming together.  Magneto and Xavier team up as best friends to combat Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who is pushing for World War III during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Shaw was also responsible for killing Magneto's mother during the holocaust , so Magneto is out for personal revenge.Unlike the other films, this one doesn't suffer from an over the top cast all seeking to hog camera time. We have a smaller concentration of mutants to get wrapped up in and to care about.  Xavier and Raven (Mystique) are growing up as best friends. We meet Hank McCoy (pre-Beast) as a scientist working on Cerebro.  Xavier uses it to seek out and recruit other mutants: Darwin, Angel, Havok, and Banshee. Meanwhile, Shaw already has his own team: Riptide, Azazel, and Emma Frost.Though Bacon was probably my least favorite character as Shaw, his scenes definitely have that 60ish Austin Power feel to them, complete with the ascots which Shaw liked to wear in the comics. His team of mutants are much more interesting and definitely upstage him. Emma Frost was superb!But unlike the earlier films, we actually get to invest in all of the mutants here along with their storylines which have equal screen time.  We see Raven and Xavier as friends.  Raven and McCoy becoming interested in each other as McCoy seeks out a way to hide their deformities.  We see Xavier caring for Erik's well-being, but Erik falling closer to evil.  And most of all, we see the other younger mutants giving themselves nicknames and learning from Professor X how to control their powers. Fans of the early films will enjoy seeing cameos by Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romijn, which made for a nice tie in.I loved the music throughout which gave the movie a real hip and upbeat feel.  Special effects were amazing.  And as I said before, I didn't feel any of the mutants really upstaged each other.

However, this movie here does an outstanding job of introducing us loyal fans to a lot of the early characters in the X-Men universe. Most notably of course, Professor X and Magneto who are both portrayed very well by the respective actors who portrayed them, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. We also get introduced to Emma Frost, The Beast, Havoc, Banshee, Azazel, Riptide, Mystique, Angel, and Darwin. Also be on the lookout for an awesome cameo from everyone's favorite Canucklehead.Now I am not big into posting spoilers, so I will try to be as vague as I can yet still give you a good overview of this film.The movie takes place during two different time periods, during World War II and during the Cuban Missile Crises of the early 60's. Both time periods are used extremely well in the telling of the story, although they don't truly jive with the comics. Kevin Bacon does a pretty good job of playing Sebastian Shaw, leader of the Hellfire Club, although I was a bit disappointed in that since it could have been done a lot better in showcasing the other members of the club and their purpose, and it would have only added perhaps a couple of minutes to the movie.Sebastian Shaw already has some mutants siding with him as he intends to create a situation where mutants will take over the Earth. Meanwhile, Charles and Eric team up together with several other mutants in hopes of thwarting Shaw's attempts and world domination. There are a lot of great scenes which help to develop some of the characters, most notably Magneto, Mystique, and Professor X, but other characters don't get very much development of their characters, so non-X Men fans might tend to be a bit lost as far as some of the characters go. But this is merely a minor annoyance.Were there any bad parts to this movie? Yes, there were a couple, most notably the character of the Beast could have been done a bit better as I thought he was to much of a whiner and I don't remember him being as such from the comics. Also I had a bit of a problem with Angel, which I always thought was a man by the name of Warren Worthington III, not some stripper. But hey, I haven't read the comics in awhile (I know, shame on me) so maybe I am missing something.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves the X-Men and I certainly hope that a follow-up film is in the making.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVDs.",5,Soooo Much Better Than Everything Except the First X-Men,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,2733,"['Well', 'just', 'got', 'home', 'midnight', 'showing', 'movie', 'have', 'unequivocally', 'state', 'movie', 'definitely', 're-boots', 'entire', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'especially', 'extremely', 'poor', 'showings', 'ofX-Men', 'Last', 'StandandX-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'way', 'are', 'responsible', 'almost', 'destroying', 'franchise', 'However', 'movie', 'here', 'outstanding', 'job', 'introducing', 'loyal', 'fans', 'lot', 'early', 'characters', 'X-Men', 'universe', 'Most', 'notably', 'course', 'Professor', 'X', 'Magneto', 'who', 'are', 'portrayed', 'very', 'well', 'respective', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'also', 'get', 'introduced', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'Beast', 'Havoc', 'Banshee', 'Azazel', 'Riptide', 'Mystique', 'Angel', 'Darwin', 'Also', 'be', 'lookout', 'awesome', 'cameo', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Canucklehead.Now', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'posting', 'spoilers', 'will', 'try', 'be', 'as', 'vague', 'can', 'yet', 'still', 'give', 'good', 'overview', 'film.The', 'movie', 'place', 'two', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crises', 'early', '60', 'time', 'periods', 'are', 'used', 'extremely', 'well', 'telling', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'jive', 'comics', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'leader', 'Hellfire', 'Club', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'showcasing', 'other', 'members', 'club', 'purpose', 'would', 'have', 'only', 'added', 'perhaps', 'couple', 'minutes', 'movie.Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'already', 'mutants', 'siding', 'create', 'situation', 'where', 'mutants', 'will', 'take', 'over', 'Earth', 'Meanwhile', 'Charles', 'Eric', 'team', 'up', 'together', 'several', 'other', 'mutants', 'hopes', 'thwarting', 'Shaw', 'attempts', 'world', 'domination', 'are', 'lot', 'great', 'scenes', 'help', 'develop', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'Magneto', 'Mystique', 'Professor', 'X', 'other', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'much', 'development', 'characters', 'non-X', 'Men', 'fans', 'might', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'lost', 'as', 'far', 'characters', 'go', 'merely', 'minor', 'annoyance.Were', 'bad', 'parts', 'movie', 'Yes', 'were', 'couple', 'most', 'notably', 'character', 'Beast', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'thought', 'was', 'much', 'whiner', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'being', 'such', 'comics', 'Also', 'had', 'bit', 'problem', 'Angel', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'man', 'name', 'Warren', 'Worthington', 'III', 'not', 'stripper', 'hey', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'comics', 'awhile', 'know', 'shame', 'maybe', 'am', 'missing', 'something.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'X-Men', 'certainly', 'hope', 'follow-up', 'film', 'making.Shawn', 'KovacichCreator', 'numerous', 'books', 'DVDs']",N/A

1415385,A26MJME9IBNETY,B004LWZW42,StrangePegs,"[2, 3]","X-Men: First Class gets the opening exactly right. It returns to the same scene that opened the first X-Men movie, so we see, again, young Erik Lehnsherr being dragged away from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. We get slightly more of what happens to Erik, this time, though, and we also get to meet Sebastian Shaw, played expertly by Kevin Bacon.However, from there, the movie bounces around and forward through time and feels a little rushed. Like there was more they should have been showing but had to cut it all out. That's always difficult when they're trying to provide enough back story and introduce several characters all at the same time, and they almost pulled it off smoothly, but not quite. Things (mostly) smooth out when we get to the present day of 1962. Oliver Platt gets a role, and, I have to say, I love Oliver Platt, so it was a joy to see him in  the movie. Rose Byrne, of Bridesmaids, is in as Moira MacTaggert, and she is also quite good.The main failing of the movie may just be a failing in me, although I'm not convinced. It might be one caused by the studio, in  this case Fox, not Marvel, not really knowing what audience they want to target. Marvel seems to have worked this out, for the most part, in  their own movies, but the X-Men franchise seems to be struggling with it. The conflict lies in how to deal with fans of the actual comic books. If you stray too far from the comics, the fans get into an uproar, but, sometimes, if you stay too close to the comic, the broader audience won't go see the movie at all (I could be wrong, but I think Warner Brothers is about to have this problem with Green Lantern (which is not to say that the movie's not going to have a big opening, but I think that may be where it ends)). When movies adapted from comics first started getting popular, that's how the studios approached it, balancing fans against people that never read comics, people who only knew of the characters peripherally. I'm finding my issue lies in a third area, that group of people that at one time followed comics but has been away from them for an extended length of time. This is the audience, the nostalgia audience, that Fox keeps messing up with. And it's a much larger audience than the audience of current fans. These are the people with the kids who, if the movie is good, will take their kids back to the same movie over and over again.All of that to say that one particular character in the movie really bothered me. Bothered me to the extent that it was distracting to me. For someone currently following the X-Men comics, this character shouldn't be an issue, but, as I watched the movie, not having even looked inside an X-Men comic published in the last decade, I couldn't see Azazel as more than a cheap Nightcrawler rip off. That character, in particular, decreased my enjoyment of the movie, because Nightcrawler has always been one of my favorite X-Men.Of course, I came home and did my background research before I started this post and discovered Azazel is a character that's been introduced since my sojourn in the comic book world ended. And he's such a Nightcrawler rip off because he's, yes, Nightcrawler's father. I won't go into my issues with that, since they have nothing to do with the movie. Most people, though, aren't going to go home after the movie and look up the character and find out there's a (unspoken) reason he's in the film. Again, maybe my reaction is just mine, but I would be surprised.The only real failing of the movie is that it succumbs to that long held movie tradition of the crash course training event whereby a completely untrained individual or group becomes expert at what they're doing in a matter of moments. In this case, the training of the X-Men lasts an entire week, and they actually comment on it during the movie, ""Look at what we've accomplished in just a week..."" For a movie that spans 18 years, you'd think they'd have worked out a better way than to cram all the training into that last week of the storyline, but no... It's unfortunate.Other than that, it's a good movie. Fox seems to have learned from its mistakes with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, although they may have also created some continuity issues between the two movies. Maybe they'll work those out at some point, but I doubt it. Now that I know Azazel is a real character, I'd actually go see it again. There's a lot to absorb in a movie like this, and it would just be nice to watch it without getting prickly every time Azazel pops onto the screen.As for the cast and characters, as I already implied, Kevin Bacon made an excellent villain. He's undervalued as an actor, so it's good to see him in a high profile role, again.January Jones is perfectly cast as Emma Frost, the white queen of the Hellfire Club. She goes from the role of the ice queen Betty Draper (Mad Men) to embodying that image literally. She doesn't show a lot of range, but, then, she doesn't need to.James McAvoy is a pleasure as Professor X, or, really, just Charles. There are glimmers of the character as performed by Patrick Stewart in McAvoy's performance, and, really, what more can you ask for than that? The only issues with the character come from the writing and not the acting. The issue stems from the desire to create a more basic conflict between Charles and Eric than one just of method. They play Xavier not just as wanting peaceful co-existence between mutant and human but as wanting the humanizing of mutants. Not that he wants them to not be mutants, but he wants them to be indistinguishable from humans. He sort of comes off as a bigot in this respect.The purist is, of course, Magneto. He believes in embracing mutantness, and, well, if you've seen the other X-Men movies, you know where this goes. Michael Fassbender does an admirable job in the role. Once he dons the helmet, he even rather looks like Ian McKellen.It was nice to see Banshee included. He's another of those X-Men that I really like that's often overlooked. He's an interesting character that they're really never delved into enough, so it was cool to see him in the mix. Caleb Jones did an adequate job in the role, but, honestly, I just kept seeing Rupert Grint superimposed in the role.Which brings us to Jennifer Lawrence. I'm sure all of you fans of The Hunger Games have been wondering when I'd get to her. Unfortunately, I don't have anything really positive to say about her. No raving about her performance. There's also nothing bad to say about her performance; it just wasn't anything that stood out. Possibly, the role didn't require anything of her other than to stand around and be herself, look pretty, but Mystique never really came into focus. There was a lack of emotional intensity that should have been present.Oh, and there's an awesome Wolverine cameo. That alone is almost worth the movie even if it had been horrible. Since it wasn't horrible, the Wolverine cameo really is icing on the cake. Not awesome cake, but good cake. With awesome icing.",4,Good cake with awesome icing,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,7023,"['X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'opening', 'exactly', 'right', 'same', 'scene', 'opened', 'first', 'X-Men', 'movie',

1415394,A2HMLGCV4ZGH2G,B004LWZW42,"The Archangel ""Light Illumine You!""","[2, 4]","Intro:I'm a long time fan of the Marvel comic franchise, specifically where Wolverine is concerned, and I am delighted to give X-Men: First Class a dignified rating. Although the movie title denotes the origins of the team, as published in the recent comic series beginning in the second half of the 2000 decade, the movie is not based entirely on the X-Men: First Class comics. The characters portrayed in the movie, for example, are loosely based on other sub-stories. Angel Salvatore (portrayed by the lovely Zoe Kravitz) was created in 2004 (Marvel's ""New X-Men""), and therefore is not an original character. Another character, Darwin (role-played by Edi Gathegi), is out of place when his first appearance is in 2006 (In the ""Deadly Genesis"" series). The decision to involve these characters in an origin story is curious, especially when Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr are relatively still young. Onto the film...Synopsis:The first half of the film delivers a magnificent back story (reasonable to comic fans) which eventually ties Xavier, Magneto, and the other characters seamlessly together. The movie opens with a familiar scene that we were privy to in Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" in 2000. As Erik Lehnsherr is separated from his mother in a Nazi concentration camp, his adolescent magnetic powers are revealed. The ensuing scene with Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and the Lehnsherr boy is not only well-acted, but gravitates an emotional pull on a realistic level that is absent from any other Marvel film. This scene leads to Lehnsherr's ascension to Magneto. Director Matthew Vaughn somehow reproduced this scene flawlessly.Meanwhile, a young Xavier and Raven (Mystique) meet during a break-in; Raven is homeless and is scrounging for food when she is busted by young X. The two, however, develop a close kinship, and Raven is adopted into the Xavier family. Years later, adult Xavier (James McAvoy) is aspiring to become a professor and delivers a thesis on genetic mutation which captures the attention of Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), a CIA operative who, while undercover, previously discovered a plot between Sebastian Shaw and USA Colonel Hendry (Glenn Morshower) to advocate the placement of nuclear missiles in Turkey. This eventual set up is brilliantly staged to create the ""real-life"" Cold War. Xavier, able to read MacTaggert's mind and thoughts, realizes the urgency with which to intervene.In doing so, Xavier and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) are introduced to CIA Division X led by The Man in Black (Oliver Platt). This stages the first attempt with humans and mutants teaming up against rival mutant/human relations. Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), hell bent on revenge, attempts to intercept Shaw and his Hellfire Club mutants, Emma Frost (January Jones) aka White Queen, Azazel, and Riptide before they can escape the CIA aided by Xavier. Xavier saves Lehnsherr and the two begin a formidable friendship, although neither see the future of mankind coexisting with mutants in the same light. This is ultimately the cause of their eventual, and inevitable, division.Sebastian Shaw's (K. Bacon) role is basically manipulating humans into destroying themselves to the benefit of mutant-kind (WW2 and Cold War). (His true goal, however, is world domination ala comics). He leads the Hellfire Club which is an international society of wealthy elites, with an illusory Inner Circle of mutants who seek to influence world affairs to favor their own agenda. Having discovered the CIA recruiting their own band of mutants (Division X / pre-X-men) to bring him down, Shaw pays a nasty retribution. Meanwhile, Xavier and Lehnsherr investigate Shaw's plan to pit the world powers, USA against Russia.I leave the rest of the movie to your discretion, but I do want to mention that a later scene between Shaw and Lehnsherr is absolutely captivating. The ascension of Erik Lehnsherr -to- Magneto is complete!My Opinion:This is the best X-Men movie thus far. It surpasses the original trilogy in acting, plot, writing, fun, action, and will earn applauds and approval from fellow marvel aficionados. Director Matthew Vaughn reshapes the dynamic world of mutants and powerfully executes a movie worth the title and our ticket money (Matinee price, lol). It also serves as a catalyst to rebooting the X-Men franchise because honestly, I wasn't sold on Singer's first two, and Ratner's mockery of a third. I will give Singer credit, however, in that HE was the one to begin the Marvel Madness in 2000. X-Men 2 was the best of the trilogy, but this prequel has so much more force, power, and emotion that the others lacked. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie. It felt more like a documentary of the events that led up to the Cuban missile crisis. Neither character looked like they were reading from a script. McAvoy and Fassbender embraced their roles and make me believe they were Xavier and Lehnsherr (Magneto) respectively. One of my favorite scenes was when Xavier and Lehnsherr approach Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) in a pub to initially recruit him to their team. Wolvie's expression was classic, and expressed my sentiments about the previous films including that gawd-awful Origin story about himself.The CGI effects were near-flawless and the integration of JFK clips helped make the film standout. I did not agree with adding characters Angel Salvatore and Darwin, as they are lame and weak replacements for Cyclops, Jean Grey, Iceman (or others they could have used), but I also understand that Vaughn was trying to tie the trilogy together with this installment. Even so, it still doesn't make sense because the White Queen is but a teenager in the Wolverine origin movie (Wolverine losing his memory after being shot in the head by an adamantium bullet, LOL PUH-LEASE!). And Magneto...ok let me clear my mind: Ian McKellen IS NOT, I repeat, IS NOT, and NEVER was a good fit for Magneto. HE WAS TOO BLOODY OLD and WEAK!! I mean, c'mon, he plays Gandalf, an OLD wizard for crying out loud!The tone of the movie is much darker, parallel to that of the Dark Knight. Although there is hardly a drop of blood, there is more violence. The director is able to realize this violence without shedding blood, and I think that is a top-notch achievement. There is no end-of-credits scene which is a first. Bummer! I was entertained every minute of the movie, and I'm usually a harsh critic, specifically to comic characters whom Hollywood has a knack for ruining. The question is, will they reboot the X-Men franchise? I hope so, but please allow Hugh Jackman, Famke Jansen, and James Marsden to reprise their roles.5/5**Green Lantern is going to FAIL hardcore, mark my words**",5,X-Marks the Spot,1307145600,"06 4,

1415403,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B004LWZW42,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","Another year, another 'reboot' in which a studio goes younger and fools around with the successful elements of a once enormously successful 'tent-pole' in an effort to continue the success of a beloved film series. Why do they do this? The actors who helped establish the series now want a bigger piece of the pie because they have become more popular. And because they have become more popular, they are appearing in more films which makes scheduling more difficult. And maybe the producers or studio heads have decided the series needs a boost in ticket sales. Ultimately, it becomes a less painful exercise to go younger and cast up-and-coming actors to take on some of the roles which have already made other people famous. Reboots are a tricky proposition. They don't always work. But in the case of ""X-Men: First Class"", a director new to the series and a good cast help make this an enjoyable summer popcorn film.Is it as good as the first ""X-Men""? No. There is just no way to replace the unmistakable force of chemistry created by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Halle Berry, Famke Jannsen, James Franco and all of the others involved. But ""First Class"" is much better than you might expect or hope.We return to the early 40s. Charles Xavier, a young boy, meets a young Raven who has broken into the mansion where he lives. She is hungry and afraid her condition will scare him off. Instead, Charles, who also has strange and unique abilities, welcomes her and she becomes a part of the family. Meanwhile, in Germany, Erik Lesher, a young boy, is separated from his parents at one of the concentration camps. A doctor (Kevin Bacon) wants to unlock Erik's power and soon realizes the easiest way to do so is to make him angry. Flash forward to the early 60s. Charles (James McAvoy) and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence, ""Winter's Bone"") are living at Oxford while Charles finishes his doctorate. Erik (Michael Fassbender, ""Inglourious Basterds"", ""Jane Eyre"") is traveling the globe trying to find the doctor and his associates, all of whom made his childhood hell. He begins the globe trotting journey in Switzerland. An FBI agent, Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, TV's ""Damages"", ""Bridesmaids"") realizes Sebastian Shaw (Bacon) and his associates are up to some mischief. She sneaks into their secret lair in Las Vegas and watches Emma Frost (January Jones, ""Unknown"", TV's ""Mad Men"") turn into a giant diamond and 'convince' an Army General to support a plan to put American missiles in Turkey. Moira realizes she needs help and reaches out to Charles. They soon meet Erik and convince him to help. With the assistance of a doctor (Oliver Platt) involved with the CIA, they search out other Mutants to recruit. After a quick training session, they learn Shaw and his associates are trying to start World War III and the tensions are escalating around Cuba.Directed by Matthew Vaughn, the director of ""LayerCake"", ""Kick-Ass"" and ""Stardust"" (which is, by the way, a horrifically underrated film), brings a lot of unique touches to the film, making it fun and exciting to watch.James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are both very good and evoke the character traits, mannerisms and sensibilities of who their characters will become and how they are portrayed by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan later. Strangely, they both manage to make the performances seem fresh and interesting. You will recognize the Stewart and McKellan versions of these characters but both of the younger actors portray their characters with a wink, wink, nudge, nudge kind of inside knowledge. The performances are fun but also respectful of the other actors' work.McAvoy has been around for a while and done some great work in very serious films like ""Atonement"". In ""X-Men"", he brings these dramatic chops to the role of Charles Xavier, lending his portrayal a certain amount of gravity. Xavier is the leader of this group, its moral center. He has to be the stern one, the one to set people on the right path. But younger Charles isn't beyond noticing when one of the trainees falls on his face and needs a little pick-me-up. There is also a lot of playfulness in his relationship with Raven, playfulness which makes him seem more age appropriate.When Xavier learns what is going on, there are a few too many of the ""This is what is happening and this is why we must stop it"" type of statements. Some of these are illustrated with graphics or brief montages which make them more interesting, but too often they seem to be simply a way for the writers to get from one point to the next with the least amount of work. In the end, these moments seem a little too sloppy and bring the quality of the film down.Michael Fassbender, last seen as Mr. Rochester in ""Jane Eyre"", is the more interesting of the two. As he begins his journey of retribution, he turns on the charm and menace, usually at the same time, making his entire persona a mystery. When we first pick up with him as an adult, he is hunting the German Concentration Camp doctor (Bacon) who made his life miserable as a young boy. His hatred is not something that has simply developed and his need for revenge must be satisfied. This need is driving his actions and failure is simply not an option. In fact, failure could drive him mad. He meets with various people, trying to track down the doctor and his associates, and this trek takes him to many corners of the globe. Each person needs to be persuaded, because the Doctor has a lot of secrets to hide and many people are willing to help him. But Erik's mutant powers prove to be very persuasive.When Erik finally tracks the doctor, who now uses the name Shaw, to Florida, he also comes across Charles, Mystique and Moira, all of whom are already trying to capture Shaw. Eventually, they come to realize what Shaw has in mind and Charles convinces Erik to join forces to take him down.What I liked most about the relationship between Charles and Erik is that we see a genuine friendship build and grow between them. Of course, there are hints at this in the first three ""X-Men"", but McAvoy and Fassbender convincingly portray the friendship and camaraderie their characters are supposed to have had in the beginning.It is also interesting to watch Erik deal with the dueling sides of his persona. In the beginning, he doesn't want to have anything to do with his mutant side, but anger unleashes his powers and the evil Doctor soon unlocks Erik's anger. Then, when he meets Charles, Xavier helps him to harness the power and to amplify it, without the accompanying anger. Later, Erik begins to deal with his mixed feelings towards humans. As he becomes closer to Charles, he sees how his friend feels about humans, the eternal hope he feels for them, and this causes even more mixed emotions within. But Erik has a deep seated hatred for humans based on how they have treated him and tried to exploit his powers. He and Charles are also fighting to stop Shaw, but there are moments when he isn't exactly sure he disagrees with Shaw.Kevin Bacon plays the doctor who almost twenty years later will change his name to Shaw and become a respected and rich member of society. Bacon was a real surprise and his performance adds a lot of fun to the film. First of all, casting Bacon as someone who doesn't age is almost brilliant. The character's similarities to Dorian Gray are explained by his own quest. And as the villain, he almost never raises his voice, yet, you sense the menace every time he comes on screen. Early in the film, as a doctor at a German concentration camp, he just exudes menace yet he smiles and laughs throughout most of the scene. This is the mark of many memorable villains. Michael Caine once remarked that if an actor is playing a drunk person by using slurred speech and stumbling around, they will ultimately look like an actor playing a drunk person. It is much more natural to tone it down and give subtle hints the character is drunk. Frequently, the best villains are portrayed as people who don't appear menacing. Yet, one word or turn of the eye is all we need to get a sense of their true threat.Later, when he returns to the story, we learn he is trying to instigate World War III. He uses his connections and the powers of his mutant friends to influence some key people. He seems to be getting closer to his goal when he is able to influence an American General to vote in his favor.There are a number of reasons why Shaw resembles a villain from a James Bond film. And when these moments happen, it does detract from the overall effect. Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of James Bond films, but they are always a bit jokey, a bit tongue-in-cheek. This works to a certain extent in a superhero film, but you also want an ""X-Men"" film to be intense. The James Bond moments are just a little too jokey and pull you out of the moment.The more time we spend with Shaw, the more we learn of his powers and the power of his friends. They are a powerful group.January Jones plays Emma Frost, Shaw's right arm. Jones seems to be channeling the spirit of former James Bond villainesses and it almost works. She has the cool, steely reserve, the beauty and the unemotional demeanor of one of Blofeld's right arms. Jason Flemyng, who seems to appear in every film directed by Guy Ritchie or Matthew Vaughn, plays Azazeal, a red skinned mutant who looks a bit like the devil. He is able to teleport to places and often grabs his foe and teleports to the sky about 100 feet above ground before letting go of the other person.Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult are the stand-outs in the new group of recruits. Not coincidentally, they also have the most screen time. Jennifer Lawrence, so memorable in ""Winter's Bone"", plays Raven/ Mystique. She practically grows up with Charles and becomes his sister. She, like Erik, is also struggling with her place in a world of humans. And Nicholas Hoult (""A Single Man"", BBC's ""Skins"", ""About a Boy"") plays Hank McCoy, who will become Beast. Hank and Raven are both struggling with how their mutation affects their appearance and how they are able to blend in with human society.Vaughn does a great job. He keeps the familiar iconography and elements of the franchise intact while adding a few little tongue-in-cheek moments, making the overall film distinctly something he can claim as his own.""X-Men: First Class"" is a lot of fun and a thrilling way to get reacquainted with the characters we have come to love.When Charles and Erik are recruiting members of their new team, there are hints to the existence of other mutants, many of whom will become future members of the X-Men. This positions the inevitable future sequels. Thankfully, this moment is integrated into the story and doesn't seem like such a blatant attempt to create a sequel.",4,"""First Class""",1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,10808,"['year', ""'reboot"",

From the special effects to the make-up and finally to the actors this film is amazing. Movies like this never win awards, but you will be hard pressed to find better performances than those of James McAvoy, Kevin Bacon, & Michael Fassbender. The whole cast was terrific, the story was fantastic, and the special effects were truly out of this world. This is a great film and I'm craving more. I can't wait to see what connections the next forty years bring between first class and the trilogy. When it's all said and done, I hope I can watch all these films and truly understand the whole story.",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,963,"['never', 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film', 'was', 'intrigued', 'confused', 'trilogy', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'missing', 'lot', 'story', 'First', 'Class', 'missing', 'link', 'will', 'answer', 'questions', 'fans', 'movie', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'comics', 'one', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'more', 'up', 'hype', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'finally', 'actors', 'film', 'amazing', 'Movies', 'never', 'win', 'awards', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'better', 'performances', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'whole', 'cast', 'was', 'terrific', 'story', 'was', 'fantastic', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'truly', 'world', 'great', 'film', ""'m"", 'craving', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'forty', 'years', 'bring', 'first', 'class', 'trilogy', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'hope', 'can', 'watch', 'films', 'truly', 'understand', 'whole', 'story']",N/A

1415412,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B004LWZW42,Tony Heck,"[1, 1]","""I always knew I couldn't be the only one who was... different.""  After Charles Xavior (McAvoy) meets Raven as a child his life takes on new meaning.  When he runs into Erik Lensherr (Fassbender) as an adult he realizes that there is a group that needs to be accepted.  The ""X-Men"" are born.  Having never been a big fan of the series I was not really looking forward to this movie.  After watching it I became a fan.  This movie is the expectation to the rule that the more sequels you make the worse they get.  This one is the best of all of them.  The fact that this movie is set against actual historical events makes this seem like more then another comic book movie.  The origins of the ""X-Men"" set against the Cuban Missle Crisis is great for a history buff like me.  This is a movie that much like the ""Star Wars"" prequels you don't need to see the others first, but you will understand more and get the call-back jokes.  For someone who was not a fan of this to start with I loved it.  For those that already are fans you will absolutly love this.  For those who have never seen any of these before, this is a good start.  Overall, not just a good sequel or comic book movie, but a great movie in general.  Highly recommend. I easily give it an A.Would I watch again? - I saw in theaters, rented it and will buy it.*Also try - The entire X-Men series.",5,A fantastic sequal/prequal and a great movie all around.

1415413,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B004LWZW42,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[6, 8]","Movie - 5.0Suffice it to say, X3 and Wolverine were pretty underwhelming. The dynamic relations in Xavier and Magneto's friendship and philosophy was pissed on and turned into some generic, shallow shell of its former self, and the potential depth in a character like Logan was wasted away by the whims of studio big heads. Thankfully, though, with Bryan Singer back on the X-train as producer and co-writer and Matthew Vaughn at the helm fresh off his Kick-Ass success, X-Men: First Class more than makes up for the disappointment. First Class is literally what it sounds like: an origins film. For those who aren't familiar with the X-Men franchise, there's actually very little you need to know, as the movie just essentially builds everything from scratch. If you're like me, and have been a fan for a while, whether it be through the comics, cartoon, or previous live-action films, then it should go without saying that you're in for a real treat. The one element that always attracted me to the franchise as a whole has always been the beliefs that Xavier and Magneto held and the conflict that existed between them. Both are ambitious and both have goals to someday create a world where mutants can live in peace. The only difference is that based on their upbringing, one believes in violence while the other does not. As mentioned about the dynamic between their relationship, I can't say how much I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Both play their roles in very convincing fashion and really manage to capture the spirit of the two, which is a refreshing sight to see and a definite positive step in the direction of the movie franchise. The storytelling is perfect in terms of character development and looks amazing on a production and technical level as well. In addition, the supporting cast does an equally good job. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique really helps to support the foundation of Xavier's beliefs, and Kevin Bacon does a surprisingly good job as Sebastian Shaw in ultimately shaping Magneto's beliefs (plus it's been a while since I've seen him in anything, so it's good to see him acting again). Before this film, I didn't think X2 could be surpassed in terms of scope. First Class has proven me wrong by a long shot. So far, this is the best movie of the franchise, and I'm hoping it leads to a few more.Video - 4.5- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1So lately, I've started to become very interested in a lot of the technical work that goes in to movies, with a big part of it being the cinematography. When I discovered John Matheison, who had done the slew of Ridley Scott's epic period pieces (Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, and Robin Hood), I was very much excited to hear of his involvement as DP for First Class. I still find it ironic that First Class itself is something of a quasi-period piece taking place during the Cuban Missile Crisis and paying aesthetic homage to the earlier Sean Connery Bond films, but I think it actually works out very well. First Class was filmed on 35mm and has a very nice filmic texture giving it a dated, yet very clean look to the overall picture. Black levels are easily the best part of the video giving lots of great shadow delineation while providing excellent detail in clothing and facial features. Contrast isn't too high or low providing a good deal of discernment between people, objects, and the background, especially in some of the more darkly-lit scenes. The color palette starts off a tad muted at the beginning of the film when we see Erik in the concentration camp, but things tend to get much more vivid when he and Charles are grown up. This is most noticeable when we see Erik traveling around the world looking for Sebastian Shaw and get some brighter yellows, oranges, tans, and whites throughout the shots of the Swiss bank and Argentinian bar scenes. Detail is sharp for a good majority of the film aside from one very dark shot when Charles and Erik are in the truck sneaking around in Russia. There's also a shot when Charles is trying to train Alex in the bomb shelter where all the light fixtures cause a kind of blue ringing effect on the camera, but it's more so just a quirk with the lighting than any kind of transfer problem. Other than those possible minor quibbles, there's really nothing wrong with the picture quality as a whole. Overall, I love the filmic texture and the picture's ability to balance dark and flashy. Emma Frost looks very good in either her sparkly dresses or diamond body form, and the visual effects appear virtually seamless whenever there's action on screen.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1- French: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles- English, French, SpanishEqually impressive is First Class' audio presentation. Designed and recorded by Ron Bartlett (some of whose work includes Sherlock Holmes, Terminator Salvation, and the final cut of Blade Runner), there's a lot to enjoy, here. To start, dialogue is clear and audible through the center, and for what Charles' power is worth, from the other four speakers. In fact, I think one of the cooler, more subtle effects of the film is his telepathy. It has something of a rippling resonance to it that gives it an even cleaner sound than just hearing him talk on camera. Granted, it's a sound effect added through post-production, but what did you expect from an X-Men movie? But moving along, I also really like Henry Jackman's score. Listening to it as a standalone CD, as a part of the movie, and then as an isolated track on the BD (in conjunction with his wonderfully spirited interview on the special features), I have to say I've really come to appreciate his compositional work and how it really creates the mood of the movie overall. And then of course there are the sound effects. Being a summer blockbuster, the film has its definite fair share of booms, bangs, zips, rumbles, etc. High and low ends handle extremely well, particularly in the form of energy charges whether it be Shaw absorbing bombs, discharging it to kill a bunch of people, Magneto moving metal, Alex shooting his beams, or Azazel's teleportation. Surround activity has an excellent balance of front and rear channel dispersion as well, some of it around the beginning and middle, but mostly at the end when the X-Men and Magneto are fighting the Hellfire Club. LFEs are my favorite part of the audio, though. The aforementioned moving of metal by Magneto is the best example of this. Much like the previous X-films, whenever he uses his powers the sound design has always made that creaking sound which, if you have a competent sub-woofer, should sound amazing. I also really like the first appearance of the Blackbird towards the end of the film for its rumbly jet turbines and engine, and of course the part where Magneto lifts the submarine out of the water and drops it on the island.Extras - 4.0- X Marks the Spot (HD; 19:55 altogether)A feature that you can either play with the movie itself or as a standalone. It plays more like the half-assed version of Maximum Movie Mode where the film diverges into behind-the-scenes footage during the actual movie and not as a true Picture-in-Picture that goes along with the it, but it's still pretty informative. However, I don't think the overall duration of it is really worth watching in-movie, as it feels a tad intrusive. Had it been something of a true P-i-P like what Vaughn was able to do with Kick-Ass, then that would've been much, much more immersing. These are  the features broken down:- Erin in Auschwitz (1:57)- Charles Meets Raven (1:56)- Mr. Howlett Declines (1:55)- Mindscape (1:49)- Emulsional Journey (4:13)- Rebecca's Return (1:44)- Cuban Beach Pre-Viz Sequence (3:07)- Retro Cool (2:51)- Children of the Atom (HD; 69:49 altogether)It's a 7-part feature that essentially covers everything from pre- to post-production and everything in-between. Of particular interest to me was how articulate the crew was in trying to make this a kind of throwback movie to the days of James Bond, but with an X-Men twist, and a little more grit. There were also some very cool snips of how the makeup and visual effects were created and implemented, and I especially loved the interview they had with Henry Jackman. It's only a few minutes, but the guy speaks so candidly and with so much gusto that I was very entertained, yet felt very informed by the what he had to say about composing the music and the kind of ideas he got from talking with director Matthew Vaughn. Here's the breakdown:- Second Genesis (10:01)Talks about the initial concept of setting the movie in the '60s, how the idea came about in the first place, and why they decided to go for it. After the abomination that was X3, I wholeheartedly accept this sort reboot prequel.- Band of Brothers (11:51)Discusses why they chose to use certain characters and how each actor was chosen to play them. In thinking about it, I find it interesting that despite continuity issues this main cast of characters still worked out pretty well. While it's definitely more of an Xavier/Magneto-centric film, the characters still offer enough support to back the literary themes of the story very well.- Transformation (10:06)A pretty cool look at the make up and prosthetics work that went into Beast, Mystique, and Azazel. In particular, I really liked the bit on choosing the right design for Beast. They mention Vaughn wasn't all that keen with Kelsey Grammer's look in X3, and that they wanted to go for a more wild, animalistic style for this re-visioning.- Suiting Up (8:33)The costuming of the film, getting all that '60s clothes, and how they managed to put yellow back into the original costumes. It was very interesting to find out that the yellow itself was supposed to represent the natural color of Kevlar.- New Frontier: A Dose of Style (9:55)Goes into great detail about how Vaughn specifically wanted to refer back to classic James Bond movies (of the Sean Connery variety) for the production and art design of First Class. They talk about how is such a genre piece now that they wanted to infuse as much of that style and ambiance as possible by building a lot of the sets from scratch. And in hindsight of what was written when Vaughn saw Inception, I can see why he was upset that the ""revolving set"" idea was beaten to the punch. Ah well, the tumbling X-Jet sequence still looks pretty cool.- Pulling off the Impossible (10:23)Shows the awesome work of Visual Effects Guru John Dykstra. Here, they cover a lot of things like how the Banshee/Angel fight scene was actually filmed on helicopters and no green screen, the detail in Emma Frost's diamond form, and concept behind Sebastian Shaw's energy absorption/discharge.- Sound and Fury (6:29)A very entertaining interview with composer Henry Jackman. The highlight of this feature is how he went through all of the trouble to create Magneto's theme with a bunch of fancy notations and drawn-out tunes, when all Vaughn really wanted was ""the f-ing bass line."" And guess what, it was a good idea.- Isolated Score (Dolby Digital 5.1 @448kbps)It would've been cooler to have it in lossless format, but it's still a great listen in hindsight of Jackman's interview and in the context of everything else the movie established both symbolically and thematically.- Deleted Scenes (HD; 14:07)Most are just alternate takes, but some of them are actually pretty funny, though they probably would not have worked as well if left in.- Cerebro: Mutant TrackerIt basically takes clips from all the other movies and tacks on a little dossier at the end of each one. I could write better bios than this based on what I've seen and read in the cartoon series and what little I've read of the comics...Personally, as informative as the extras are, I was hoping for it to be closer to the level of Kick-Ass, where at least an audio commentary or a true P-i-P track to go along with all, if not most of the movie, would've been nice.Overall - 4.5I've always been a fan of the X-Men franchise. I read some of the comics, watched all of the cartoon, played the numerous video games, collected the action figures, even made a (short-lived) fan club for it in 5th grade, and have really enjoyed the live-action movies (the first two, anyway..). And just when I thought X2 could never be topped, I was proven wrong. Matthew Vaughn (whom I now really wish would've done X3) has really shown signs of great directing prowess. Screw the financial shortcomings and pay attention to just how great of an X-Men film this is and show your support for more incarnations to make their way into the franchise. Whether it be more prequel stuff or even present day continuations, Brett Ratner's piece of crap and the slightly better (but not by much) Wolverine have been redeemed. With some masterful characterizations, a fun atmosphere, and some amazing production values, the movie deserves high praise. And while the extras are still a good two hours in length, I still wish a better P-i-P or at least an audio commentary were available. But with reference A/V quality to enhance the already great story, this is still one of my favorite BDs for the year so far. It's a must-own for X-Men fans and even a definite recommendation for those who aren't familiar with the franchise.",5,X-Men: First Class (Blu-ray),1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,13435,"['Movie',

With a setting that went from World War 2 up to the Kennedy's time in office, we not only had mutants but also a political portrait highlighting all the elements needed to bring mutants to light.The movie is really one dealing with the early years of the Magneto, how the X-Men became the X-Men, and just who the Hellfire Club is. I really thought the portrayal of many of the characters, especially Magneto and Sebastian Shaw, were top notch and captured, at least in part, what the comics noted about them throughout the years.Magneto's youth and the way the case was laid out, allowing him to age and to go from a helmet- mashing, anguish- driven youth to a tooth-puling, coin twirling adult really kept me captivated.  The rise of the X-Men was documented well enough, liberties, as always, taken with the storylines. The Hellfire Club also took the cake with their displays of out-and-out bloodshed, utilizing their powers in ways that the series had held back until then. It made the characters complex in some ways, showing just how ""bad guys"" might not be the baddies you think, and how ""good"" can be a relative term. the story of beast, how Mystique got involved with both X and Magneto, what happened with the Professor - they took these on as well.The effects were also stellar. From submarines rising from the depths looking realistic as powers attempted to pull them from the wave to missile showers freezing in mid-flight, I found myself happy and surprised. I expected less and liked this enough to want to go from renting to buying. you not only had big fights but also detail work that explained the characters and what they did, allowing anyone entrance into the ways mutants work. That was nice considering the fact that I watched this with my family and we all seemed to enjoy it.I think this was a good 5/5, possibly the best X-men film.

1415419,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004LWZW42,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""X-Men: First Class"" is a prequel to all three ""X-Men"" movies, following the story of two ""Mutants"" with superhuman abilities, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), and their battles against evil Dr. Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) attempting to start World War III. The story that opens with a Nazi concentration camp focuses the friendship between Charles and Erik, better known as Professor X and Magneto, before they part ways and become opponents as seen in other three ""X-Men"" films.There is one big action sequence involving the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 that is impressive, but ""X-Men: First Class"" is most effective when showing the contrasting (and complementary) personalities of the two main characters. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are convincing as Charles and Erik, played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen respectively in the three preceding ""X-Men"" movies.Having special abilities is not a welcome thing to some of the characters, like a genius scientist Hank McCoy / The Beast (Nicholas Hoult). The subplot deals with the relationship between Hank and Raven / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), a shape shifter recruited as a government agent, but their story is not fully developed.Producer-turned-director Matthew Vaughn has directed three films so far - ""Layer Cake,"" ""Stardust"" and ""Kick-Ass,"" all critically well-received. Again he has created compelling characters and the universe they live in, within the framework of the genre these films belong to.Those who haven't seen the other ""X-Men"" films can enjoy ""X-Men: First Class,"" which works pretty well as a stand alone movie, but perhaps you should see the first two ""X-Men"" films directed by Brian Singer to understand the recurrent theme of the series, as well as some amusing references including Hugh Jackman's brief cameo.",5,"First Class, First Rate",1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,1841,"['X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'prequel', 'three', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'following', 'story', 'two', 'Mutants', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Erik', 'Lehnsherr', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'battles', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'attempting', 'start', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'story', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'friendship', 'Charles', 'Erik', 'better', 'known', 'Professor', 'X', 'Magneto', 'part', 'ways', 'become', 'opponents', 'seen', 'other', 'three', 'X-Men', 'one', 'big', 'action', 'sequence', 'involving', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', '1962', 'impressive', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'showing', 'contrasting', 'complementary', 'personalities', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'are', 'convincing', 'Charles', 'Erik', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'respectively', 'three', 'preceding', 'X-Men', 'movies.Having', 'special', 'abilities', 'not', 'welcome', 'thing', 'characters', 'genius', 'scientist', 'Hank', 'McCoy', '/', 'Beast', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'subplot', 'deals', 'relationship', 'Hank', 'Raven', '/', 'Mystique', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'shape', 'shifter', 'recruited', 'government', 'agent', 'story', 'not', 'fully', 'developed.Producer-turned-director', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'directed', 'three', 'films', 'so', 'far', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'Stardust', 'Kick-Ass', 'critically', 'well-received', 'Again', 'created', 'compelling', 'characters', 'universe', 'live', 'framework', 'genre', 'films', 'belong', 'to.Those', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'X-Men', 'films', 'can', 'enjoy', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'pretty', 'well', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'should', 'see', 'first', 'two', 'X-Men', 'films', 'directed', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'understand', 'recurrent', 'theme', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'amusing', 'references', 'including', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'brief', 'cameo']",N/A

The ""Origins: Wolverine"" story line was ok, but nothing great, and unlike a lot of the reviewers here, I did enjoy X-Men 3 as a nice closure to the main team story arc (despite the death of Professor X and Cyclops in X3...hopefully that's not a spoiler to anyone who's reading this).  I would also agree that X-Men 2 was the best of the lot.  I followed the comic for a few years as a kid, so most of the heroes and villains were all known to me, quite a bit of the back story was familiar too, and for the most part I really enjoyed the transformation of the story and characters to screen.And based on the previews, I had high hopes for this movie as well.Unfortunately my expectations weren't met.  Apart from the excellent performance and convincing development of the Magneto character by Michael Fassbender (previously known from "" Inglourious Basterds"" among other pieces), a lot of the rest was just a little flat.  McAvoy does a decent job with his Professor-X-to-be role, but it seemed a bit off-target (a little TOO conceited and brash) from how it was developed for the X-Men series.Kevin Bacon seems ok in the role as Sebastian Shaw, but as already pointed out in a review, he seems a bit out of place in his scenes...like he just walked on to the set after a quick coffee break and they started rolling before he got fully in character.  And January Jones, who I really liked in ""Mad Men"" either has a null presence or looks mostly annoyed that she's in the movie...maybe because she's walking around in her underwear half the movie (which would normally be a plus for me, but she wasn't able to make it work, so to say).And unfortunately that seems to be my feel about a lot of the rest of actors/characters...good enough for a comic book movie but nothing phenomenal (Fassbender excluded...McAvoy to a lesser degree).  The special effects are good, the story line interesting enough, but the gaggle of little teener mutants (recruited by Xavier to fight the battle for good!) just added unnecessary clutter to the cast.  Even Jennifer Lawrence, who was awesome in ""Winter's Bone"" was just kind of ""there"" in the movie despite ample screen time.The problem with long running comic books is after awhile, they start to resemble soap operas with a constant churning of plot line, character, drama, sex, violence, etc.  What made the first 2 X-Men movies special was more of a human story line, about people who just happened to have super powers (and wear tight outfits!) and solid acting to present that conflict.  This X-Men story has some of that with the Xavier/Magneto development but it strays from that focus more than I'd prefer.SO, all-in-all I enjoyed the movie...just not near as much as I had hoped based on the previews (which primarily focused on Fassbender and McAvoy, the movie's strengths in my book).Lastly a few non-sequiturs that  bugged me in a not-so-major way:- Why does Xavier grow up in New York with a British accent and his little foster sister (Raven or Mystique) never develops one?  Or better pondered, why didn't he lose his?- Why does Eric/Magneto have a slightly Irish accent in this, when in later years he has a full-blown Shakespearean accent (as Ian McKellen portrayed him)?- Magneto isn't made of metal (or magnetic) and therefore trying to stop a moving submarine shouldn't pull him along behind it (like he has a magnetic pull towards it)- And...uh...many others I won't dwell on for fear of appearing like more of a geek than I am",3,"Didn't live up to the trailers, but still ok...",1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,3547,"['now', ""'ve"", 'mostly', 'enjoyed', 'X-Men', 'series', 'movies', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'ok', 'nothing', 'great', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'here', 'did', 'enjoy', 'X-Men', '3', 'nice', 'closure', 'main', 'team', 'story', 'arc', 'death', 'Professor', 'X', 'Cyclops', 'X3', 'hopefully', 'not', 'spoiler', 'anyone', 'who', 'reading', 'would', 'also', 'agree', 'X-Men', '2', 'was', 'best', 'lot', 'followed', 'comic', 'few', 'years', 'kid', 'most', 'heroes', 'villains', 'were', 'known', 'quite', 'bit', 'back', 'story', 'was', 'familiar', 'too', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'transformation', 'story', 'characters', 'screen.And', 'based', 'previews', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'well.Unfortunately', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'met', 'Apart', 'excellent', 'performance', 'convincing', 'development', 'Magneto', 'character', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'previously', 'known', 'Inglourious', 'Basterds', 'other', 'pieces', 'lot', 'rest', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'flat', 'McAvoy', 'decent', 'job', 'Professor-X-to-be', 'role', 'seemed', 'bit', 'off-target', 'little', 'TOO', 'conceited', 'brash', 'how', 'was', 'developed', 'X-Men', 'series.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'ok', 'role', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'review', 'bit', 'place', 'scenes', 'just', 'walked', 'set', 'quick', 'coffee', 'break', 'started', 'rolling', 'got', 'fully', 'character', 'January', 'Jones', 'who', 'really', 'liked', 'Mad', 'Men', 'either', 'null', 'presence', 'mostly', 'annoyed', 'movie', 'maybe', 'walking', 'around', 'underwear', 'movie', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'plus', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'make', 'work', 'say', '.And', 'unfortunately', 'be', 'feel', 'lot', 'rest', 'actors/characters', 'good', 'enough', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'nothing', 'phenomenal', 'Fassbender', 'excluded', 'McAvoy', 'lesser', 'degree', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'interesting', 'enough', 'gaggle', 'little', 'teener', 'mutants', 'recruited', 'Xavier', 'fight', 'battle', 'good', 'just', 'added', 'unnecessary', 'clutter', 'cast', 'Even', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'was', 'awesome', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'was', 'just', 'kind', 'movie', 'ample', 'screen', 'time.The', 'problem', 'long', 'running', 'comic', 'books', 'awhile', 'start', 'resemble', 'soap', 'operas', 'constant', 'churning', 'plot', 'line', 'character', 'drama', 'sex', 'violence', 'etc', 'What', 'made', 'first', '2', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'special', 'was', 'more', 'human', 'story', 'line', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'have', 'super', 'powers', 'wear', 'tight', 'outfits', 'solid', 'acting', 'present', 'conflict', 'X-Men', 'story', 'Xavier/Magneto', 'development', 'more', ""'d"", 'prefer.SO', 'all-in-all', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'hoped', 'based', 'previews', 'primarily', 'focused', 'Fassbender', 'McAvoy', 'movie', 'strengths', 'book', '.Lastly', 'few', 'non-sequiturs', 'bugged', 'not-so-major', 'way', 'Why', 'Xavier', 'grow', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'British', 'accent', 'little', 'foster', 'sister', 'Raven', 'Mystique', 'never', 'one', 'better', 'pondered', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'Why', 'Eric/Magneto', 'have', 'slightly', 'Irish', 'accent', 'when', 'later', 'years', 'full-blown', 'Shakespearean', 'accent', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'portrayed', 'Magneto', ""n't"", 'made', 'metal', 'magnetic', 'therefore', 'trying', 'stop', 'moving', 'submarine', 'should', ""n't"", 'pull', 'along', 'magnetic', 'pull', 'uh', 'many', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'fear', 'appearing', 'more', 'geek', 'am']",N/A
1415429,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B004LWZW42,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[6, 7]","Wildly entertaining ""X-Men: First Class"" works amazingly well as both a prequel to the trilogy (there are inconsistencies between this film and the third one but it's also been suggested by the makers of this that it is a reboot since Professor Xavier and Magneto are working together in the third film and Professor X can walk in the third film and ""Wolverine"")and on its own even if you haven't seen the other films. It's refreshing particularly after ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" which had some major dramatic flaws.I'm going to skip the plot of the film because that's been well covered elsewhere except suffice to say that this is where Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender)first meet and try to stop Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon)a mutant determined to wipe out humanity.Evidently ""X-Men: First Class"" doesn't play on all Blu-ray players (most notably some of the 3D players and Samsung)so be aware that until they develop firmware updates it will be a problem for some players. I'd suggest shutting off your BD Live if it is Playstation related as that sometimes will also slow down the loading of the BD.The image quality for ""X-Men: First Class"" is top notch with a brilliant, sharp and colorful presentation.The Blu-ray features a number of cool extras including ""Cerebro: Mutant Tracker"" allowing you to track your favorite mutants and see exclusive videos, profiles, etc.""Children of the Atom"" a  multi-part documentary on the making of the film focusing on the origin of the story and the obvious James Bond influence on many sequences of the film. We also get deleted and extended scenes (some of which if director Matthew Vaughn had been allowed to add them back in would have worked quite well for home video)and an isolated score by composer Henry Jackman.There's also an ""X Marks the Spot"" enhanced viewing mode allowing one of eight featurettes to pop up as you're watching the film.The film also comes with BD-Live enabled content including exclusive ""proof of concept"" footage of the aerial dogfight between Angel and Banshee, a digital copy of the film for PC's. You can also access 10 free X-Men comics in digital format online but you do have to register with Marvel.com.Over all ""X-Men: First Class"" is a top notch film with a heck of a lot of plot packed into it's 2 hour and 12 minute running time. Part of the success of the film certainly can be attributed to director Mathew Vaughn's (who, interestingly, was originally to direct ""X Men: The Last Stand"" after Bryan Singer departed but before Brett Ratner stepped in) unique take on the material as well as Bryan Singer's involvement again (and let's not forget the producers and the scriptwriters, the original comic book creators, etc.)with the series.The film manages to be both entertaining while also having a conscience a rare thing in a big Hollywood production these days.After ""X2"" this is the finest of the series of films.Highly recommended.",4,Exceptional prequel (or reboot since it's inconsistent with what we see in the other films),1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,2959,"['Wildly', 'entertaining', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'amazingly', 'well', 'prequel', 'trilogy', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'film', 'third', 'one', 'also', 'been', 'suggested', 'makers', 'reboot', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'are', 'working', 'together', 'third', 'film', 'Professor', 'X', 'can', 'walk', 'third', 'film', 'Wolverine', 'own', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'refreshing', 'particularly', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'had', 'major', 'dramatic', 'flaws.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'skip', 'plot', 'film', 'been', 'well', 'covered', 'elsewhere', 'suffice', 'say', 'where', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Erik', 'Lehnsherr', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'first', 'meet', 'try', 'stop', 'Sebastian', 'Shaw', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'mutant', 'determined', 'wipe', 'out', 'humanity.Evidently', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', ""n't"", 'play', 'Blu-ray', 'players', 'most', 'notably', '3D', 'players', 'Samsung', 'so', 'be', 'aware', 'develop', 'firmware', 'will', 'be', 'problem', 'players', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'shutting', 'off', 'BD', 'Live', 'Playstation', 'related', 'sometimes', 'will', 'also', 'slow', 'down', 'loading', 'BD.The', 'image', 'quality', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'top', 'notch', 'brilliant', 'sharp', 'colorful', 'presentation.The', 'Blu-ray', 'number', 'cool', 'extras', 'including', 'Cerebro', 'Mutant', 'Tracker', 'allowing', 'track', 'favorite', 'mutants', 'see', 'exclusive', 'videos', 'profiles', 'etc', 'Children', 'Atom', 'multi-part', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'focusing', 'origin', 'story', 'obvious', 'James', 'Bond', 'influence', 'many', 'sequences', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'director', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'add', 'back', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'home', 'video', 'isolated', 'score', 'composer', 'Henry', 'Jackman.There', 'also', 'X', 'Spot', 'enhanced', 'viewing', 'mode', 'allowing', 'one', 'eight', 'featurettes', 'pop', 'up', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film.The', 'film', 'also', 'BD-Live', 'enabled', 'content', 'including', 'exclusive', 'proof', 'concept', 'footage', 'aerial', 'dogfight', 'Angel', 'Banshee', 'digital', 'copy', 'film', 'PC', 'can', 'also', 'access', '10', 'free', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'digital', 'format', 'online', 'do', 'have', 'register', 'Marvel.com.Over', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'top', 'notch', 'film', 'heck', 'lot', 'plot', 'packed', '2', 'hour', '12', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'Part', 'success', 'film', 'certainly', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'director', 'Mathew', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'interestingly', 'was', 'originally', 'direct', 'X', 'Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'departed', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'stepped', 'unique', 'take', 'material', 'as', 'well', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'involvement', 'again', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'producers', 'scriptwriters', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'creators', 'etc', 'series.The', 'film', 'manages', 'be', 'entertaining', 'while', 'also', 'having', 'conscience', 'rare', 'thing', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'days.After', 'X2', 'finest', 'series', 'films.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
