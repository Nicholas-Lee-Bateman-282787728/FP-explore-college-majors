1428492,A2OU43FBUB8OYD,B004USNHWG,VIC JAURIQUI,"[22, 22]","With this season of 32 episodes, the Father Knows Best series called it a day.  It's too bad because it probably could have gone on for another year or two.  But Robert Young and Jane Wyatt were tired (she one referred to this season as ""sheer hell"").  but there are exceptional shows.  One is ""Betty's Double,"" where Elinore Donahue as Betty wins a look-alike contest based on her resemblance to Donna Stewart, also played by Donahue.  She finds Hollywood to be shallow and cruel (Isn't it funny how Hollywood always portrays ""Hollywood"" as a vacant, distant entity?).  Another good one, funny to be sure is ""Togetherness,"" where a reporter is assigned to profile the Anderson clan.  The results are predictable, but hilarious.  As usual, Billy Gray as Bud shines in every episode that's centered around him.  The best being ""Bud Lives It Up,"" where he goes a little crazy by overspending on a college trip.  Consequences abound.  Gray was better than Tony Dow of Leave It to Beaver, or Paul Peterson of the Donna Reed Show, as an actor that is.  A very, very natural actor.  Truly gifted.  I was really amazed that he didn't go further in his career after FKB went off the air in 1960.  The shows all have the original beginning music for season 6, and the correct season 6 ending music on a handful of shows. Bonus features (NO REUNION MOVIES from 1977!!!) two shows from Robert Young's next show, Window on Main Street.  No captioning.  There aren't too many shows from the 50s that have all the episodes released on DVD.  I think I love Lucy and The Honeymooners are the only others, but this show is a gem.  Classy, well-written and very heartwarming.

1428493,AVBC26VPR0BAE,B004USNHWG,"Vincent T. Lynch ""vtl""","[20, 22]","This afternoon I finally finished watching all of the FKB releases, and they are well worth your time, attention, and dollars.  I began with season 3 and 4, then went back to 1 and 2, then on to 5 and 6.  And I'm glad I did it in that order -- the first two seasons are kind of ""finding their way"", and it was somewhere midway through season 2 where they figured out what they wanted the series to be.  In my view, FKB, without a laugh track, would be considered to be basically a drama series, with a few laughs along the way.  Many of the episodes are very serious about kids growing up.  And the idea often expressed that this was a too perfect family...well, I don't agree.  Bud was selfish, often rude and inconsiderate, and had little common sense.  Betty was an overachiver.  And, Cathy was a whiner.  Sounds like some families I knew.  Yes, Mom and Dad were probably the best parents one could hope for...but even they sometimes realized their failures -- it is surprising over the course of the series how often they told their children they were ""ashamed"" of them.  In other words, what I am saying is -- this is real life, with a little humor thrown in.  Around 200 episodes, and I enjoyed virtually every one of them.  There are few series from the past or the present that I can say that about.  Highest recommendation, and heads above Ozzie and Harriet or the Cleavers -- those were JUST situation comedies.  FKB is the gold standard.",5,"Not a situation comedy, despite the laughs",1305244800,"05 13, 2011",2011,1448,"['afternoon', 'finally', 'finished', 'watching', 'FKB', 'releases', 'are', 'well', 'time', 'attention', 'dollars', 'began', 'season', '3', '4', 'then', 'went', 'back', '1', '2', 'then', '5', '6', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'order', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'kind', 'finding', 'way', 'was', 'somewhere', 'midway', 'season', '2', 'where', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'wanted', 'series', 'be', 'view', 'FKB', 'laugh', 'track', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'basically', 'drama', 'series', 'few', 'laughs', 'way', 'Many', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'serious', 'kids', 'growing', 'up', 'idea', 'often', 'expressed', 'was', 'too', 'perfect', 'family', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Bud', 'was', 'selfish', 'often', 'rude', 'inconsiderate', 'had', 'little', 'common', 'sense', 'Betty', 'was', 'overachiver', 'Cathy', 'was', 'whiner', 'families', 'knew', 'Yes', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'were', 'probably', 'best', 'parents', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'even', 'sometimes', 'realized', 'failures', 'surprising', 'course', 'series', 'how', 'often', 'told', 'children', 'were', 'ashamed', 'other', 'words', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'real', 'life', 'little', 'humor', 'thrown', '200', 'episodes', 'enjoyed', 'virtually', 'one', 'are', 'few', 'series', 'past', 'present', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'Highest', 'recommendation', 'heads', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'Cleavers', 'were', 'JUST', 'situation', 'comedies', 'FKB', 'gold', 'standard']",Father Knows Best: Season 6
