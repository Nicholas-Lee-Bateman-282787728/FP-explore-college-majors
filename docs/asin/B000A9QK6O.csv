924316,A1IOGEZUZPII8C,B000A9QK6O,travels10,"[1, 1]",This is one of my favorite retro scary tv series.  I am delighted its on dvd now.  Its a bit  dated with the 1980's style clothing/hair/music but the scripts are still fun to see again.  I recommend this set as its well worth the money for  the set of seasons 1 & 2 for a mere 20 bucks  ( season one is just 6 episodes ) you can't go wrong.  I would rate this for viewing as tv 14 at least with blood/gore/nudity and scare level.  Ages 12 + at least.  I viewed this as age 21 and older and it was very creepy fun for my husband & I on HBO.  I wish the show had consisted of more series.  The price is totally affordable for both seasons so you can't beat that.  Wish packaging was a plastic vs. a paper sheath for collectors of this show like myself.
