1338769,AOE7LVHSVID6Q,B003ETX5S8,Carol,"[0, 1]","I watched ""Fireball"" for the fist time last night. Great movie. Interesting story line with a surprise ending. I decided to buy this movie because Ian Somerhalder is in it. I watch ""The Vampire Diaries"" and I am use to seeing him play a vampire. I could never have pictured him as a cop until now. Love him. I didn't know any of the other actors in this movie but they were all believable. This movie is rated PG13. It does NOT come with special features. I didn't know that when I bought it but I am very pleased with it over all. I found it a little slow getting started but within about 30 min. I was pulled in. Buy this movie. It's great.",5,Fireball,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,642,"['watched', 'Fireball', 'fist', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'Great', 'movie', 'Interesting', 'story', 'line', 'surprise', 'ending', 'decided', 'buy', 'movie', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'watch', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'am', 'use', 'seeing', 'play', 'vampire', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'pictured', 'cop', 'now', 'Love', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'were', 'believable', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG13', 'NOT', 'come', 'special', 'features', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'bought', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'found', 'little', 'slow', 'getting', 'started', 'about', '30', 'min', 'was', 'pulled', 'Buy', 'movie', 'great']",N/A

Boy, was this movie a huge letdown from the start.I'm hard-of-hearing, so subtitles really help me to understand what people are saying in a film... and this movie didn't have English subtitles OR closed-captioning. But it had Spanish subtitles. Go figure. The story revolves around a prisoner who is caught in a fire when he is locked up in his cell, and he comes near death from the heat and smoke inhalation. So he gets fire-making powers from this because for some reason that is never explained, his cells mutate. So at the hospital he's all bandaged up because of his scars, but when the bandages come off, his skin is as good as new.The movie quickly unravels into a stupid story that makes little sense scientifically or plot-wise. The acting is awful and there's a lot of little mistakes and plot-holes in the action and sequences. It looks like a cool movie - the cover makes it look cool - but this is definitely a movie to avoid, unless you're looking to MST3K it.",2,wasted potential,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,1091,"['movie', 'was', 'available', 'Redbox', 'when', 'was', 'making', 'selection', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'enough', 'check', 'out', 'Boy', 'was', 'movie', 'huge', 'letdown', 'start.I', ""'m"", 'hard-of-hearing', 'subtitles', 'really', 'help', 'understand', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'film', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'closed-captioning', 'had', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'Go', 'figure', 'story', 'around', 'prisoner', 'who', 'caught', 'fire', 'when', 'locked', 'up', 'cell', 'death', 'heat', 'smoke', 'inhalation', 'fire-making', 'powers', 'because', 'reason', 'never', 'explained', 'cells', 'mutate', 'So', 'hospital', 'bandaged', 'up', 'scars', 'when', 'bandages', 'come', 'off', 'skin', 'as', 'good', 'new.The', 'movie', 'quickly', 'stupid', 'story', 'little', 'sense', 'scientifically', 'plot-wise', 'acting', 'awful', 'lot', 'little', 'mistakes', 'plot-holes', 'action', 'sequences', 'cool', 'movie', 'cover', 'look', 'cool', 'definitely', 'movie', 'avoid', ""'re"", 'looking', 'MST3K']",N/A

Lexa Doig is the fire inspector who figures it all out and she is very good and then we have Ian Somerhalder...love this character! City guy not happy in the country! Plays the lovable snob so well. Different story and good performances ( except for the pre-requisite douche-bag fireman who resents Lexa, don't like the inclusion of this type of character all the time) sit back and have fun.",4,surprise,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,769,"['was', 'very', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'action-thriller', 'movie.Aleks', 'Paunovic', 'bad', 'guy', 'Draven', 'who', 'ability', 'create', 'fire', 'combo', 'designer', 'steroids', 'system', 'getting', 'caught', 'fire', 'trigger', 'ability', 'very', 'menacing', 'convincing', 'Lexa', 'Doig', 'fire', 'inspector', 'who', 'out', 'very', 'good', 'then', 'have', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'love', 'character', 'City', 'guy', 'not', 'happy', 'country', 'lovable', 'snob', 'so', 'well', 'Different', 'story', 'good', 'performances', 'pre-requisite', 'douche-bag', 'fireman', 'who', 'Lexa', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'inclusion', 'type', 'character', 'time', 'sit', 'back', 'have', 'fun']",N/A
