746067,AV663ODS3GJQV,B00008OP59,Chris NYC,"[0, 0]","Personally, I feel this movie is under-rated because it is quite enjoyable. Like most Hindi movies, it has the introductory story, singing with dancing, and romance. It really deserves a better rating but many movie watchers look for other qualities. This movie is funny and romantic and as recent as 2010.  I say fans of Kapoor and Roshan should see for themselves how good the movie.The story begins with a wonderful couple who are deeply in love and living in London. They have three unmarried daughters.The wife is then hit bar a car in the middle of trying to escape a frenzy of bullets of gangsters and police after leaving the mall. She soon passes away and the husband then seeks to not only build a friendship with his daughters but find them husbands. Roshan plays a good family friend, almost like a son and he helps in the process. Not to give any more of the movie away, it is well worth the watch.",5,This is really a nice movie!,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,911,"['Personally', 'feel', 'movie', 'under-rated', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'Hindi', 'movies', 'introductory', 'story', 'singing', 'dancing', 'romance', 'really', 'better', 'rating', 'many', 'movie', 'watchers', 'look', 'other', 'qualities', 'movie', 'funny', 'romantic', 'as', 'recent', '2010', 'say', 'fans', 'Kapoor', 'Roshan', 'should', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'movie.The', 'story', 'wonderful', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'deeply', 'love', 'living', 'London', 'have', 'three', 'unmarried', 'daughters.The', 'wife', 'then', 'hit', 'bar', 'car', 'middle', 'trying', 'escape', 'frenzy', 'bullets', 'gangsters', 'police', 'leaving', 'mall', 'soon', 'away', 'husband', 'then', 'not', 'only', 'build', 'friendship', 'daughters', 'find', 'husbands', 'Roshan', 'good', 'family', 'friend', 'almost', 'son', 'process', 'Not', 'give', 'more', 'movie', 'away', 'well', 'worth', 'watch']",N/A

The main angle is the personal friendships a father gets with his daughters after his wife dies. He aims to go beyond roles and traditions and be a personal friend to each. He does this somewhat erratically and incompletely often but Jackie Stroff does bring a sensitivity to the character of the father by the end.I really like Hrithik but this isn't one of his best. It is one of his earlier movies though and he really had yet to do his best stuff. There is some hammy over-acting and labored scripting. There is a big speech at the end which is meant to be moving but I found somewhat awkward, meandering and ineffective in stirring emotion. However there are some good dance sequences with Hrithik as a redeeming feature. Jackie Stroff is also good and Kareena Kapoor fine. My co-watcher found it patchy and fragmented rather than  a cohesive whole.This movie has had very mixed success. It flopped in India but went on to become a huge grossing movie in foreign markets.

746077,AOUFNKPTMAIHO,B00008OP59,vent,"[5, 5]","Okay what would be the nicest thing to do here is keep to the positives ( oh if only I could do that). The actor who plays Kareena Kapoors father does very well and is the only truly good performance in this movie. Kareena Kapoor must of just been bored out of her mind. She probably thought this movie would go differently than it did. Frankly wasn't that impressed with her performance in this. The crocodile (alligator?) scene is beyond stupid. Hrithik did what he could with the material given to him. I'm not picky, I read so many novels and watch so many chick flicks it's absurd and even I couldn't get real enjoyment out of this movie. The cinematography in London was 1980's pure MTV grainy disco but in India not bad. The houses were pretty and the countryside nice.  The songs were pretty good , some real good . Those are the only positives . This movie feels forced and contrived with no real flow to it. The hero's oppressive parents  are wooden and have either over the top or PATHETIC DIALOGUE that feels like it's read off a prompter with less emotion than you would use in a hemorrhoid commercial (another pain in your butt ). I get the feeling Hrithik wanted to walk over to the writer and punch him in the face and then walk back to his mark on the floor and wait for the word action to be screamed. He was probably using that as his motivation for the enraged scenes . If you want to see Hrithik in a heartbreaking romance movie with better acting try GUZZARISH. Then there is Dhoom 2 for his dancing and stunts. For romantic melodrama piece try him out in MUJSE DOSTI KAROGE, tear jerker with better script. I have only been watching bollywood for about 3 months now and seen about 50 films from the 1990s and forward. I bought 9 Hindi films from Amazon last night. Yes I love bollywood drama's, comedy romance , costumes dance , music ,slapstick,all of it...as long as it's well written. It would be an insult to all the really good films out there to give more than two stars because others are much more deserving. I've never written a negative review before, Sorry....

746078,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B00008OP59,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[1, 1]","Oh I knew this day would come, I just didn't think it would be like this. Sometimes really bad movies happen to good people, and this movie has lots of casualties. All I can say is that Mr. Subhash Ghai has a lot to answer for. I appreciate multi-talented people, I think that people who can wear more than one hat in their business. But I'm sorry, no Director should write, direct, and *edit* his own movie completely on his own! Oh god, what arrogance, Karan Johar said it best ""Directors are the most self-indulgent people"" that's why they direct a TEAM. Apparently, nobody gave the man that piece of advice. Too bad, because the actual bones of this has a lot of potential, the writer in me is dying to get my hands on a copy of the script and do a massive overhaul! I realize that it sounds incredibly egotistic but I dabble. And believe me I know 4th graders who can do better on a bad day!Like I said, the bones are good. A widower with three daughters and the trials he faces as they step into adulthood is a great jumping off point. Unfortunately the script mishandles the entire thing and loses half it's heart. Then there are the most ridiculous scenarios that happen with Alligators for God's sake! What the h-e-double-hockey-sticks was that! Okay if that's not a slap in the face enough after the love story gets the conventional screw-up things just get downright pathetic. Seriously, I'm watching while I write this and I can only shake my head in dismay. How did this man manage to convince highly intelligent and TALENTED actors to do it? How? It makes no sense.That said, there are good moments to be had and ONLY because Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor somehow, someway, managed to not murder the director for forcing them to make fools of themselves! I had no idea Hrithik Roshan could do a dead on Jim Carry impersonation MIND BLOWING! And of course the man can dance, just put him on film dancing and that takes a bit of the bad away. But again the dialogue and direction only serve to mutilate the man's efforts to give some credibility and decency to this whole farce. It's like you can figuratively hear Mr. Ghai off-camera saying ""Hrithik in this scene stand out in the cold in a micro-weave see-through wife beater and throw your arms out to the sky and sway around, you're in agony."" Oye! Poor guy, I can understand why he's done some minor hammy moments for his father, but this is different. And honestly, the man does try really hard to make good, and he manages to pull off some great moments but in the end, he just can't make this good. He's made some pretty bad stuff in his day good,FizaandKites(and both are MASTERPIECES in comparison) But it's no wonder he got a bit depressed around this time about work.Poor Kareena Kapoor! I really like her, and would definitely call myself a fan, and again I've seen her do some pretty awful moviesBodyguard (2011) (Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema DVD)(okay it's worse than this movie) but to have a non-high-fashion glamour role, and then to be forced to throw a shawl over an Alligator and have music numbers that have you rolling around a bed in satin sheets, singing songs while heaving and I guess it was supposed to be sexy but it wasn't it was awkward, it didn't fit the character at all, and I was freaked out! At least Item Numbers like Chikni Chalame and Sheila Ki Jawani make sense for the character's and the story's in their respective films.I'm not prudish, but there's a difference between sensual and downright VULGAR! Mr. Ghai had several instances of characters just being completely inappropriate and just weird, like the scene with Ronhit (or is it Rohit the movie never could make up it's mind) and his Fianc&eacute;e ""working out"" that was completely unnecessary and plain icky! Oye!Jackie Shroff, was a HUGE deal back in the day and in the beginning he's wonderful! But by the second half he's lost it, his character goes back and forth like a tennis ball, and he gives up. I mean it, there's a moment where you can tell he's just through trying to make things work and decides to get the shots as quickly as possible so he can get the heck out of Dodge.The supporting cast would have been great if this was supposed to be a hardcore madcap masala comedy in the style ofTees Maar KhanBUT THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A MADCAP MASALA! No it's supposed to be a grand Love Story. And so some of the most talented actors in India play live cartoon characters with absolutely no conviction whatsoever. To make matters worse, with the exception of Isha's eldest sister and her husband they're ALL despicable!I thought this could be a guilty pleasure because I'm an optimist, but I'm not sure I can spend another three hours like that even with Hrithik Roshan! Why give it three stars? Three reasons...1. Hrithik Roshan can dance.2. Some of the songs were pretty good.3. Both Kareena Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan did their very best to give the audience some very good moments despite having everything stacked against them. That deserves some praise even if the end result is abysmal. And now, they can both look back on this as a bad memory, and be contented that they not only survived the massacre of they're talents, but have gone on to THRIVE in some truly great performances. In the end they got the last laugh they so richly deserve!",3,It Might've Worked If...,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,5342,"['Oh', 'knew', 'day', 'would', 'come', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think',
