It reminded me of one of those teen/family movies from the 80s or early 90s.  If was fun and heart felt.  Good for the entire family!!!!  I still have not deleted it.  I am waiting for my mom to watch.  Now I can just buy the DVD.The movie is about a girl who finds a way to talk even though she is shy.  Then something happens that may require her to let everyone know who she is!  Will she get over her fear and just let people know who she is, or will she continue letting out her emotions while staying hidden?  You will have to watch to see.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 4]","3 1/2 Stars for fans of Disney Channel Movies2 Stars for Everyone ElseI'll be the first to admit that I am not the intended target for Disney Channel original programming. But a number of their recent movies have had enormous cross-over appeal whether from infectiously bad pop songs, likable leads, or just by qualifying as silly fun. I know the network has been trying to position Debby Ryan as the next big thing, and fans of ""Jessie"" (among other projects) will likely flock to ""Radio Rebel."" But I'm not sure that I see a superstar quality as much as I see a pleasant and nice young lady. This movie really plays as a pint-sized and thoroughly scrubbed version of Christian Slater's cult hit ""Pump Up The Volume."" It serves a positive message, for sure, in that everyone should be happy with who they are. But aside from that affirmation, ""Radio Rebel"" falls a bit a short in comparison to other Disney efforts. It offers little in the way of surprises or originality, and the humor isn't strong enough to overcome a rather lackluster and familiar plot.Ryan plays a painfully shy girl in what appears to be Seattle's most squeaky clean high school. She experiences all the regular issues such as an unrequited crush and being on the outside of the popular clique. But she yearns to be accepted for who she is! A popular radio figure has captivated the entire school with her up-with-people podcasts. Known only as Radio Rebel, everyone (aside from the cartoon villains) are enchanted by the mysterious voice. Just by uttering familiar platitudes about acceptance, she has revolutionized the way people think about themselves! This is such a goldmine of originality (not so much), a local station picks her up for a city-wide broadcast. Poor Seattle! The citizens of that great city really want to hear constantly about a local high school (with about 40 students) and its prom problems? Doesn't say much for entertainment in the metropolitan area.In case you haven't figured it out, Ryan is Radio Rebel. You know where this flight of fancy is headed from the opening scene. To add drama, the school principle is made out to be a nasty piece of work. So one-dimensional and uninterested in her students, it's an insult to educators. She punishes the rebellion (so slight you won't even notice it) by calling off the prom. But Radio Rebel can solve that, find love, and teach a few lessons along the way. It must be exhausting! ""Radio Rebel"" is certainly well meaning, it just lacks a bit of the fun that I expect from these endeavors. Pleasant, but unimaginative, the Disney Channel has put out many better, more entertaining, and/or funnier films.

I was initially a bit skeptical; I thought it might be overly immature and cheesy since it was made by the Disney Channel... but I was actually pleasantly surprised by what the movie held.This is a squeaky clean flick (thank you, Disney!); I can't remember even a trace of innuendo or bad language. It would be completely safe for any member of the family to watch. It's set in high school and most of the characters are school age, so occasionally it does have a slightly ""young"" feel, but not extremely so. I thought the characters were cast pretty well, especially Tara.There's a nice amount of comedy, and while some might consider it cheesy-comedy, I couldn't help but laugh at the antics. Is it completely realistic? No... but I found it entertaining anyway. It's a very ""up"" feeling film, with an overall happy-go-lucky vibe.I admit the book and movie are wildly different, but both have their own merits. If you're familiar with the book, I advise trying to view the movie as a completely separate piece of work...while the stories do loosely parallel each other(somewhat), hardly anything is completely the same, aside from the radio station name--SLAM FM. If you're willing to set aside the book and look at the film as a separate piece of work, I think you'll find it fairly entertaining. :)",4,Inspiration for shy people everywhere!,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,1408,"['reading', 'book', 'was', 'inspiration', 'Radio', 'Rebel', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'check', 'movie', 'was', 'initially', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'overly', 'immature', 'cheesy', 'was', 'made', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'was', 'actually', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'movie', 'held.This', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'flick', 'Disney', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'even', 'trace', 'innuendo', 'bad', 'language', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'safe', 'member', 'family', 'watch', 'set', 'high', 'school', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'school', 'age', 'so', 'occasionally', 'have', 'slightly', 'young', 'feel', 'not', 'extremely', 'thought', 'characters', 'were', 'cast', 'pretty', 'well', 'especially', 'Tara.There', 'nice', 'amount', 'comedy', 'might', 'consider', 'cheesy-comedy', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'antics', 'completely', 'realistic', 'No', 'found', 'entertaining', 'anyway', 'very', 'up', 'feeling', 'film', 'overall', 'happy-go-lucky', 'vibe.I', 'book', 'movie', 'are', 'wildly', 'different', 'have', 'own', 'merits', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'book', 'advise', 'trying', 'view', 'movie', 'completely', 'separate', 'piece', 'work', 'stories', 'do', 'loosely', 'parallel', 'other', 'somewhat', 'hardly', 'anything', 'completely', 'same', 'aside', 'radio', 'station', 'name', 'SLAM', 'FM', ""'re"", 'willing', 'set', 'aside', 'book', 'look', 'film', 'separate', 'piece', 'work', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'fairly', 'entertaining']",Radio Rebel
