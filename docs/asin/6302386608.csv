310340,A2YM9ILTAX0782,6302386608,"Birt Acres ""Cinemaniac""","[2, 3]","""Dolly Dearest"" (1991) is a poor imitation of ""Dolls"" (1987) and ""Child's Play"" (1988)--certainly its only financial hope being to cash in on the others' success.  The cinematography is unimaginative and pedestrian, the story predictable.  I saw the preview for ""Dolly Dearest"" on the ""Servants of Twilight"" (1991) video--both straight-to-video releases.  The preview, I must say, was quite frightening, giving the impression that ""Dolly Dearest"" would be more like the straightforward plot of ""Child's Play.""  But ""Dolly Dearest"" posits a Mayan devil-child taking over the bodies of some Mexican dolls.  (Why dolls?  Why not!)  However the children of Satan apparently can be easily killed with a shotgun and some dynamite.  Not much to worry about here.Comparing ""Dolly Dearest"" and ""Dolls"" shows the absolute need for 1) a modicum of imagination from the director, and 2) a smidgen of creativity from the cinematographer.  The plot of ""Dolls"" is rather banal, although it does have an E.C.-revenge logic to it.  But ""Dolls"" just plain looks better.  If you're going to sit through an hour-and-a-half of dumbness, at least make the dumbness look good.  The cinematography of ""Dolly Dearest"" is usually plain, sometimes plain ugly.  Also, the camera does absolutely nothing to increase the tension.

310345,A17E28QEX42YU0,6302386608,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[3, 6]","'Dolly Dearest' finds itself with just enough filmmaking competence to become watchable, but we'd probably be better off had it not been able to conduct a coherent scene.The story is derivative, and stupid. Family of four moves to Mexico -- Dad's opening up a doll factory! Nice big house in the country, with a nice fat Mexican maid to top; it's gonna be some goooooooooood livin'. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the first scene of the film finds some sort of evil spirit find its way into the factory, where some of the dolls' exist. Naturally, the little girl in the family wants a doll (dumb *)@%&!_). So, the doll comes home with her, and bad things happen.Watching 'Dolly Dearest', all I could think of is how, by comparison, the 'Child's Play' films -- all three of originals -- are utter masterpieces. The first one, perhaps most importantly, with its unique and compelling idea, but moreover its execution of such a potentially disaster-ridden concept. Re-watching the original 'Child's Play' recently, and just now painfully absorbing 'Dearest', it's pretty easy to articulate why they're at two different ends of the ""killer-doll"" spectrum.'Child's Play' had personality. Brad Dourif's vocal work with Chucky added so much; he had personality, wit, and growls of psychotic rage scary enough to make you run from a two foot doll without the slightest hint of shame. The doll(s) in 'Dearest', on the other hand, spout claptrap in the guise of a little girl's voice spliced with a predictably 'demonic' tone. God. Then, there's the dolls themselves. Granted, 'Dearest' didn't have the budget of Chucky, but that doesn't save it from criticism; these dolls are UGLY -- 'before' they are inhabited by the spirit of Voodoo McGee -- and once they began to walk and talk, I began to give up on the film, succumbing to the hate deep within me. I'm sorry, but utilizing the same %*#!U!J""FLQKA shot of the doll walking -- below the waste and only below the waste -- a shot which is laughable the very first time it's seen, is inexcusable. How am I to focus on the dolls' deliciously maniacal murders when I'm continually jolted out of whatever reality the film manages to evoke, courtesy of what appears to be a small manikin gliding on roller-skates, over and over? If that's not enough, I have to hear them, in their demonic-girly voice, spout tripe like 'this is fun!!!'.  I noticed something was amuck towards the earlier bits of the film, observing the doll who's mentally thwarted sweet little daughter Jessica walk into the doll house, via a camera from afar.  I could have 'sworn' that, in fact, this was no doll entering the doll-house, but a life-sized woman; or, at the very least, a midget.  Maybe the Jesus-fearing maid?  Couldn't have been; the spirits pounced Jesus and Mrs. Dusty ten minutes beforehand. What's funny, though, is that re-watching the scene, I came to the conclusion it was in fact a doll they used... Which brings me to the doll -- c'mon.  The thing, below its neck anyway, is practically obese, spouting a beastly physique and the height of a power forward.  It's just repugnant to the eyes, and when we have no choice but to look at its limited facial expressions (I could have sworn one of them looked either stoned or retarded toward the end, peering out of a dumpster in the factory) and robotic motion, we die inside.The other thing is that this movie is tediously boring.  The pacing is unbelievably slow, and very little action occurs. In 'Child's Play' we knew, as demonstrated conceptually and by repeated mannerisms, that Chucky was befriending little Andy merely as a ploy to take his physical body and get out of the plastic his spirit had been enveloped in.  You'd think, after watching 'Dearest', that these demons inhabiting the doll are really in it all just so they can play tea-party with Jessica, or, even worse, play 'tea-party' with Jessica; i.e., they're doing some really awful things to her in the dollhouse behind closed doors, which the dolls are suspiciously prone to lock. At least maybe we'd get some sort of twisted commentary on the subject of ancient spirits -- these demons are dead on arrival, with the most anonymous of personality complexes and unknown intentions.The acting ranges from decent to embarrassing, but by and large I withstood the apathy of the characters' pretty well.  And idiocy... By the time Jessica growls at Mommy in a deep, jacked-from-The-Exorcist voice, and Mommy's subsequent reaction, though, it became harder to endure. The Dad/Husband comes running up; 30 seconds later they're out of the room.  Mommy: ""I -- think -- she's changing.""  (when Satan propels out of someone's mouth, I'd be a little more assertive in my beliefs. You THINK?).  The Husband's reaction is priceless: 'No, the only one who's changing around here is YOU.""  Queue music.  Tear.  Such resonant, family melodrama.  Bypass all rational analysis of possessed daughter -- you aren't connecting with your husband!.  The last fifteen minutes of the film is somehow worse than that which precedes it, because all of a sudden out of this lethargy everything gets emotional, or at least the exaggerated motions' by the characters would make you think so.  It's like -- oh, so you care now?  It's a lose-lose situation; you want the dolls to dismember the whole family alive (I didn't mind the dork kid, though), and sacrifice Jessica to their primal Gods. But then, you also want to see each doll get hit repeatedly with a 4x4 -- on several specific points, upper body namely -- so how are you supposed to reconcile with such expectations?  I honestly don't know.The contemplation is there for anyone who liked Chucky's outings, but do not, please, venture into this abysmal pit of filmic vomit.",1,Abhorrent,1161216000,"10 19,

I mean if you can get past the cheesy special effects, you will probably be blocked again by the acting. At least it runs the spectrum - there is over acting, under acting and just plain bad acting.  Who (s) is responsible for this...the Read family. They sinks their entire life savings into the pipe dream of Elliot Read (Sam Bottoms) to have the best little doll manufacturing plant ever. His hopes are dashed however as he and his kids visit the ""state of the art"" plant which has apparently been closed down for years since the original doll maker died. Apparently his real estate agent copied some impressive figures from an American Business book for all of the financials on the company. Really, hasn't Elliot ever heard of researching an investment? Maybe visit the plant you are going to buy?On the first visit to the factory, little Jessica Read (Candy Hutson) sets her heart on one of the dolls and Dad lets her take it home. Jimmy Read (Chris Demetral) is immediately fascinated by the archeological dig next door to the doll factory. As the film progresses, Jessica becomes more and more obsessed with Dolly. Mom, Marilyn Read (Denise Crosby) begins to get worried when Jessica threatens her in a demonic voice that she will kill her if she tries to take Dolly away.'Dolly Dearest' is not that great and it's a bit long and drawn out between the action sequences. Again, what it lacks in the acting department and initial special effects it partially makes up for with Dolly herself. When Dolly starts to mess with the Read family she gets quite animated and evil. She actually kind of freaked me out at times but I am probably not a good judge in this department because evil dolls just really spook me in general. The only saving grace in the acting department is the small part of the archeologist Karl Resnick (Rip Torn). They really should have used Rip Torn more. He is just fun to watch on the screen.

310347,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6302386608,JGC,"[1, 1]","""Dolly Dearest"" is a super-low-budget, cable TV movie that came out in the early '90s, that has since found ""life after death"" as a cult-favorite among fans of slasher doll films. The premise is just so silly and ludicrous that anyone would have to laugh out loud at the complete and total nonsensical plot. Dolly is this vicious little monster who comes to life after a Mexican doll factory is opened near the ancient burial ground of satan's spawn. So much for outsourcing! I love how Dolly would run around, she didn't say much (Dolly was the strong, psychotic type), but her facial expressions were pure evil. Picture Miss Piggy with the face of a depraved wildebeest. Dolly sure managed to put the capital-B in this b-picture! There was just an incredibly chilling quality to her that will not go unnoticed. Perhaps it's because Dolly is just a totally evil misery-machine, although she has a much better disposition than most people from NJ. The film stars Denise Crosby and includes a bunch of second-rate performances that go along perfectly with this second-rate picture. There is even the stereotypical religious Mexican maid and the nun who is ""in seclusion."" Does it get any more over-the-top than that? If you want a good laugh, watch ""Dolly Dearest.""

They could have treated the topic of a ""killer doll"" like the ugly stepchild and made it into a B-movie with very little effort.  Instead, they put a lot of effort into a great creative plot, a creepy atmosphere, and they hired actors who could act.  Usually every movie, by the time you're done watching, you can point to one or more actors that either didn't act well or were mis-cast.  I can't say that about anyone in this film.  The children, parents and rest of the cast fit very well together.  They acted well, worked hard, and none of the lines they were given were lame or made you roll your eyes, which is a credit to the screenwriter too.  This definitely ranks up there as one of the better killer doll movies.  It feels real, it's portrayed as real and a great overall job by those involved.  Watching Rip Torn act serious was a pleasant surprise after seeing him in comedic movies the last few years.  If you're into possessed puppets or killer dolls definitely rent or buy this.Other recommendations are the Chucky movies, ""Dolls"", ""Puppet master"", and ""Blood dolls"" (which is now my new favorite guilty pleasure movie).Great job.

That made me wonder if it was that bad.  Well, that wasn't it.  It also wasn't because it was that good, either.  It was a middle of the road horror film.  Enjoyable, but if you watch a lot of movies you may forget the best parts of this.I don't want to add spoilers, so I'll say what I did not like about this movie.  A few times I became impatient because the story dragged a bit, but to be fair it never dragged on too long.  It did keep my interest.Some of the lines were very cheesy, cringingly so.  Example - Denise Crosby shouts at a nun, ""I'm not giving up my daughter to a 900 year old goathead!""I get her frustration, but that just made me cringe.Also, I don't think the background of the story was developed as well as it could have been.  There should have been a richer history as to precisely why the events were unfolding as they were.  To me the explanation given was a little too...lacking.Now, what I did like -It was fun to watch. I love ""killer-doll"" movies and this one ranks up among the better ones.I liked the fact that the actors all looked like ""real people"" and not overly made-up and ""too pretty"" actors.  I actually felt that the Mexican workers were really Mexican workers!  That was a great touch.The actress and actor who played the brother and sister were terrific.  The boy was funny, intelligent, and precocious without becoming annoying, imo.  He could have become a bit too much, but I think the film-makers held him back just enough to make him just right.The little girl was fantastic and played the innocent child as well as the possessed child very well.  She reminds me of a young Drew Barrymore.  Lovely and talented.Not a movie that you'll likely remember for the rest of your life unless you are a cult-horror fanatic, but certainly one that will pass a pleasant afternoon or a bit of a creepy night when you are in the mood for horror with touches of humour.",3,Not bad for some horror fun!,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,2006,"['took', 'almost', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'realize', 'had', 'seen', 'had', 'forgotten', 'made', 'wonder', 'was', 'bad', 'Well', 'was', ""n't"", 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'good', 'either', 'was', 'middle', 'road', 'horror', 'film', 'Enjoyable', 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'may', 'forget', 'best', 'parts', 'this.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'add', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'say', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'became', 'impatient', 'story', 'dragged', 'bit', 'be', 'fair', 'never', 'dragged', 'too', 'long', 'did', 'keep', 'interest.Some', 'lines', 'were', 'very', 'cheesy', 'cringingly', 'so', 'Example', 'Denise', 'Crosby', 'nun', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'daughter', '900', 'year', 'old', 'goathead', 'get', 'frustration', 'just', 'made', 'cringe.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'background', 'story', 'was', 'developed', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'richer', 'history', 'precisely', 'why', 'events', 'were', 'unfolding', 'were', 'explanation', 'given', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'lacking.Now', 'what', 'did', '-It', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'love', 'killer-doll', 'movies', 'one', 'better', 'ones.I', 'liked', 'fact', 'actors', 'looked', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'overly', 'made-up', 'too', 'pretty', 'actors', 'actually', 'felt', 'Mexican', 'workers', 'were', 'really', 'Mexican', 'workers', 'was', 'great', 'touch.The', 'actress', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'brother', 'sister', 'were', 'terrific', 'boy', 'was', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'precocious', 'becoming', 'annoying', 'imo', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'film-makers', 'held', 'back', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'just', 'right.The', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'fantastic', 'played', 'innocent', 'child', 'as', 'well', 'possessed', 'child', 'very', 'well', 'young', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Lovely', 'talented.Not', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'remember', 'rest', 'life', 'are', 'cult-horror', 'fanatic', 'certainly', 'one', 'will', 'pass', 'pleasant', 'afternoon', 'bit', 'creepy', 'night', 'when', 'are', 'mood', 'horror', 'touches', 'humour']",Dolly Dearest VHS

310358,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6302386608,Paperbackstash,"[0, 1]","During the 80's/early 90's, when the doll trend was big and going strong, this little movie reared its ugly head to try and make a fast buck. With Chucky we had a pretty cool subplot, a goofy but catchy sense of humor, some cruel kills, blood and a definite character. Stuart Gordon's classic Dolls in the late 80's will forever remain a keeper in my eyes, and Demonic Toys -- while foul mouthed and seemingly low on budget -- was unique enough to make it work. No matter how much money this one did make (which probably wasn't too much) all it did was put me to sleep and induce a small headache.The Reed family moves near a doll factory (not running) that is built on top of an ancient Indian burial ground (how original). Evil little Mayan spirits come to possess the bodies of large, creepy, identical female dolls with long strait orange/red hair and freckles. One of these captures the fancy of the little girl and after she brings the piece of demonic plastic home, things go seriously bad in the Reed house.The daughter in question (Candace Hutson) gets on my last nerve as she quickly and predictably becomes obsessed. She changes almost overnight to curly hair and too-cute-for-word dresses as well as a ""glare"" that is supposed to make you stop dead in your tracks, but the only way I would pause when staring into a face like that is because I would be laughing too hard to move. The maid acted scared, though, too much -- the overdrama made me chuckle even more. Oooh, how freaky. And what are these glares supposed to mean? Seriously, if an adult sees a child shoot a dirty look they'll think ""Bratty child"", not ""evil force lurking beneath the youngster's spirit"".Her brother (Chris Demetral) is a little better in acting but doesn't as much in the way of characterization. The lead woman (mother, wife) Denise Crosby (Pet Semetary) performed well but I could never get into the roles I've seen her play. I don't know why, she's not a bad actress (although I don't find her that good either), there's just something about her that appears phony to me and makes it difficult to get into. The hubby (Sam Bottoms) was good but the final draw is that no one in this movie was remotely interesting and I couldn't have cared less if the doll killed them all.The main roles seem to be the mother and female child. A cool part of the film centered on a large dollhouse I would have loved to have as a kid. The girl is pretty bratty and rebellious as she's changing but learns how to work the mother by using false charms. The servants all know legends of the lands and have their religious practices to try and keep evil spirits away. As we see from the maid, having the house blessed is not the way to get on the dolls good side. The little boy likes going exploring in the mines and doing stuff he's really not supposed to do but it's all subplot.Most of the murders are that offscreen- while -on -screen implied dribble. The body count is good and some of the deaths inventive enough (it's bad to be a servant in these parts) but nothing could save this flick. The maid's death was particularly brutal, but again, nothing shown in detail. At least it was slightly drawn out and they attempted to build a little suspense.The dolls animate well and by themselves are sort of freaky but nothing stands out about them like...well, pretty much like a personality.

Despite warnings from the housekeeper (Real Women Have Curves' Lupe Ontiveros), dad goes ahead and starts getting the old factory ready for production, while Jimmy befriends an archaeologist (Rip Torn, in what may have been the nadir of his long, storied career) who's trying to uncover the tomb of a legendary local demon child. Jimmy, who fits a lot better in small spaces, is a big help. But man, Jessica starts acting funny, and a couple of folks swear they see Jessica's new doll--the last one made by the factory before the mysterious death of the original artist--moving of its own accord...Yes, it should all sound very familiar. And there's nothing at all that should make you think you're going to get anything different than Child's Play, except the doll is of a different sex. I'm all for riffing on the plots of older movies and coming up with something interesting and original, but this isn't a riff, and Child's Play had only come out four years before; it's nothing more than a second-rate knockoff with barely competent direction and average acting at best.

Naturally one of the Puppet Masters was a top choice, and probably will happen before the months out, but on-demand gave us a different option in Dolly Dearest. This film is one of those we've seen bits and pieces of years ago just never sat down to watch the entire thing. After doing a little review research it appeared the film had a lot of good feedback, and being that it's from the fantastic decade of 90's horror didn't hurt. So with that going for it it seemed like the natural choice.Taking place in Mexico we start with an archaeologist whose working on opening a tomb belonging to the devil worshiping Sanzia tribe. Accidentally he unleashes the evil spirit of a devil child, that was a very poorly made yet hilarious red mist looking graphic, also taking his life. So from here we have an American family with 2 kids who are set to open their own doll factory on the cursed land. Once the doll manufacturing starts the evil spirit possesses one of the harmless yet creepy looking toys making it's way to the daughter Jessica. She begins to take on some odd changes and the rest is the family trying to take out the evil spirit.Overall Dolly Dearest was a very enjoyable killer doll flick filled with chubby banditos at every turn. When it comes to this Halloween reviewing project Sid has taken on, it's a must to get a minimum of one flick terrorized by a murderous piece of plastic. Really what's creepier then a two foot maniac doll running around loping peoples heads off? There obviously were some stale moments, but for the most part it was a good 90's horror watch. The best part would have to be when the chubby Pachanga impersonating Mexican worker is cooking up a burrito, this isn't a joke, and gets so freaked out by the possessed dolls he drops dead of a heart attack. That was one hilarious moment and may get an award for best use of Mexican in this years Woody Awards.",3,Mr. Marbles Banditos style,1254960000,"10 8, 2009",2009,2025,"['forge', 'ahead', 'October', 'horror', 'movie', 'trail', 'decided', 'stop', 'off', 'witness', 'something', 'murderous', 'doll', 'department', 'Naturally', 'one', 'Puppet', 'Masters', 'was', 'top', 'choice', 'probably', 'will', 'happen', 'months', 'out', 'on-demand', 'gave', 'different', 'option', 'Dolly', 'Dearest', 'film', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bits', 'pieces', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'never', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'entire', 'thing', 'doing', 'little', 'review', 'research', 'appeared', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'feedback', 'being', 'fantastic', 'decade', '90', 'horror', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'So', 'going', 'seemed', 'natural', 'choice.Taking', 'place', 'Mexico', 'start', 'archaeologist', 'working', 'opening', 'tomb', 'belonging', 'devil', 'worshiping', 'Sanzia', 'tribe', 'Accidentally', 'evil', 'spirit', 'devil', 'child', 'was', 'very', 'poorly', 'made', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'red', 'mist', 'looking', 'graphic', 'also', 'taking', 'life', 'So', 'here', 'have', 'American', 'family', '2', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'set', 'open', 'own', 'doll', 'factory', 'cursed', 'land', 'doll', 'manufacturing', 'evil', 'spirit', 'one', 'harmless', 'yet', 'creepy', 'looking', 'toys', 'making', 'way', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'take', 'odd', 'changes', 'rest', 'family', 'trying', 'take', 'out', 'evil', 'spirit.Overall', 'Dolly', 'Dearest', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'killer', 'doll', 'flick', 'filled', 'chubby', 'banditos', 'turn', 'When', 'Halloween', 'reviewing', 'project', 'Sid', 'taken', 'must', 'get', 'minimum', 'one', 'flick', 'terrorized', 'murderous', 'piece', 'plastic', 'Really', 'what', 'creepier', 'then', 'two', 'foot', 'maniac', 'doll', 'running', 'around', 'loping', 'peoples', 'heads', 'off', 'obviously', 'were', 'stale', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'good', '90', 'horror', 'watch', 'best', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'when', 'chubby', 'Pachanga', 'impersonating', 'Mexican', 'worker', 'cooking', 'up', 'burrito', ""n't"", 'joke', 'so', 'freaked', 'out', 'possessed', 'dolls', 'dead', 'heart', 'attack', 'was', 'one', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'may', 'get', 'award', 'best', 'use', 'Mexican', 'years', 'Woody', 'Awards']",Dolly Dearest VHS

(They seem to forget that ""Child's Play"" wasn't completely original itself! Remember that episode from ""The Twilight Zone?"" or how about the ""Zuni Doll"" from the original ""Trilogy of Terror"" series from the 70's, starring Karen Black?) I feel that ""Dolly Dearest"" is actually pretty good, despite it being considered a ""B-film"". The film does seem to pay tribute to ""The Exorcist"" and obviously ""Child's Play,"" but the setting does give it that ""Nowhere To Run"" feeling, with its location in the deserts of Mexico,as opposed to the bustling of over-populated city life in Chicago. I also feel that there is something much more haunting about this antagonist, as opposed to that of the ""Child's Play,"" series for two reasons. One, ""Child's Play,"" in my opinion was completely obliterated by its now FOUR sequels, and soon to be REMAKE! In truth, the films are more known for their dark comedy/humor, than their actual scares. But also, in that these dolls are possessed by the spirit of a demonic child of ancient legend, as opposed to that of a human serial killer with a sense of humor (there is very little of that in this film, thank goodness). What I believe is scarier about this, is that serial killers are overly-abundant every day realities to us. Whereas, the spirit world, while fabled, made legend of, and talked of since man first appeared on earth, is not as real to everybody.
