817973,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B0001Z4P6O,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[3, 49]","This is not THE SINGING DECTECTIVE, which I liked very much. Although I watched PENNIES FROM HEAVEN straight through all six episodes, I did not find the storyline or the conclusion satisfactory. In fact, I can't think of a redeeming feature about the series. Some of the songs are familiar, because my folks had many of the recordings from that era, but many of the tunes were not familiar at all. The series probably appealed to viewers in the 1970s, because many of the folks who survived the Depression were still alive and tv was a relatively new phenomena. The actors are superb. I am a fan of Cheryl Campbell, and Bob Hoskins has a nice mouth, but in the end as far as I am concerned, they didn't carry the day.It's difficult for me to imagine the generation that enjoyed `Sex in the City' and `Coupling' would find much of interest in this series.  How can the younger generation get the fact that in the ""old days"" women who enjoyed sex (let alone had sex outside marriage) were wanton? It's all so depressing.Maybe there is one redeeming feature.  As always the shots of England are grand.  There are plenty of lovely country roads and great old automobiles for car afficionados.",3,Not very good.....,1091923200,"08 8, 2004",2004,1189,"['not', 'THE', 'SINGING', 'DECTECTIVE', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'watched', 'PENNIES', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'straight', 'six', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'storyline', 'conclusion', 'satisfactory', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'series', 'songs', 'are', 'familiar', 'folks', 'had', 'many', 'recordings', 'era', 'many', 'tunes', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'series', 'probably', 'appealed', 'viewers', '1970s', 'many', 'folks', 'who', 'survived', 'Depression', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'tv', 'was', 'relatively', 'new', 'phenomena', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'am', 'fan', 'Cheryl', 'Campbell', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'nice', 'mouth', 'end', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'day.It', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'generation', 'enjoyed', 'Sex', 'City', 'Coupling', 'would', 'find', 'much', 'interest', 'series', 'How', 'can', 'younger', 'generation', 'get', 'fact', 'old', 'days', 'women', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'sex', 'let', 'alone', 'had', 'sex', 'marriage', 'were', 'wanton', 'so', 'depressing.Maybe', 'one', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'always', 'shots', 'England', 'are', 'grand', 'are', 'plenty', 'lovely', 'country', 'roads', 'great', 'old', 'automobiles', 'car', 'afficionados']",Pennies from Heaven
817974,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B0001Z4P6O,Gavin Wilson,"[93, 94]","Late 1970s Britain was not particularly accustomed to campaigning graffiti, but in 1978, there was an explosion of slogans on railway bridges etc declaring that 'George Davies is Innocent!' It says something for the power of this TV series that a few wags wrote 'The Accordion Man is innocent!' in public places.(For those unaware of the plot, the accordion man is a key character in this six-episode series. When a blind girl is raped and murdered on the road to Gloucester -- the plot was conceived long before the Fred West crimes, by the way -- the accordion man is the principal suspect. Another suspect is the music salesman Arthur Parker, who we know to be a liar, cheat and two-timer with slightly unusual fetishes.)If you haven't seen this series before, you'll be startled by the lip-synching. On several occasions each episode, at the end of a dramatic piece of dialogue, the lighting will suddenly change, and the characters will start to mime and dance to a piece of 1920s/1930s music. When the song is finished, the characters return to precisely where they were before the musical interruption. It's a strange device -- quite different from conventional musicals or operas -- but extremely powerful in showing how music transports people to another world. Tolkien uses a ring to transport Frodo to another world, Pullman uses the Subtle Knife to transport Lyra, and Dennis Potter uses song. There is a very powerful speech in episode #2 where Bob Hoskins, playing Arthur, describes the impact of love and song as ""pennies from heaven"", very much as a religious experience.For me, this is Potter's masterpiece. It's less polished than the Singing Detective, but I think that this helps to frame the principal issues of love, sex, death, music and spirituality more starkly. Many of the settings come from Potter's own experience -- the Forest of Dean, the village schoolroom etc.There are two very beautiful actresses in this production -- Cheryl Campbell and Gemma Craven -- and it's difficult to convey the shock created in 1978 by the scene in which Craven bears her rouged nipples. (Previously she had been known only for appearing in the children's film of Cinderella, and she played her Potter character in a very child-like way until this scene.) It's all very tame now, but the scene still has some power, provided you can overcome any disbelief that the Craven character would ever marry Hoskins!The 3-DVD set comes with precious few extras -- just a photo gallery and a commentary on episodes #1 and #6 -- and as you would expect, the production is in a 4x3 frame and monaural. Picture quality is cleaned-up 70s standard, and the sound quality is OK. Many of the records that the characters mime to are presented with all their scratches. (Curiously these scratches aren't so audible on the 2-CD collection that used to accompany the series.)This is a fantastic series, but I don't pretend that it's for everyone. It comes from an era when TV playwrights aimed to produce more than just entertainment.George Davies, by the way, may have been innocent of whatever he was originally jailed for. But he was back in prison several years later on a totally separate conviction that people didn't seem to dispute.As for the Accordion Man, well ... you'll just have to watch the series!From his early days, Dennis Potter was obsessed by the nature of the religious experience, particularly the Christian version. The black and white 'Son of Man' play for the BBC examined the earthly life of Jesus. 'Brimstone and Treacle' examined the possibilities when the Devil visits one home.'Pennies from Heaven' took elements from the gospel story and mixed it with a Bonnie and Clyde story of a man and his lover on the run. Thus Arthur Parker tries to evangelise the world with his musical message -- he gets very few takers, at least initially. In the end, he is tried by a Pilate-like figure and executed for a crime he didn't commit. Having been hanged, he then appears to the Mary Magdalene figure (Cheryl Campbell playing a prostitute). The analogy falls down with the Accordion Man, a key character in the play who has no direct biblical equivalent -- although he may be a Judas Iscariot figure who, burdened with guilt, commits suicide. But the most heretical aspect of this analogy is that Arthur Parker as a Christ figure is such a duplicitous liar and cheat.The casting in this magnificent production is excellent. The part seemed tailor-made for Bob Hoskins, and it's hard to imagine Steve Martin playing this role in the American film version. The two leading ladies are outstanding: Cheryl Campbell a superb actress whose dancing improved immensely, and Gemma Craven a great dancer whose acting ability surprised many critics at the time.I don't doubt that this is one of the most important musicals yet made, and along with 'The Singing Detective', it's a fitting tribute to the genius of Dennis Potter. Just before the hanging in the final episode, there's a hint that pennies from heaven are nothing more than the arc of urine created by schoolboys competing to see who can aim highest. That at the very last gasp Potter tries to trivialise the entire concept with this joke is a mark of his mastery of the dramatic form.",5,'The Accordion Man is still innocent'  |  a true

817976,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0001Z4P6O,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[5, 5]","A long time ago, television stations would take great chances and produce TV that was intelligent, thought provoking, and profound.  This is one of those examples.  Dennis Potter's Pennies from Heaven is one of the greatest TV miniseries ever made.  While not as good as The Singing Detective (which is Potter's masterpiece), this is still magnificent and worth investing all 7 hours or so.  This is far superior to the film version.  The film isn't terrible, but taking a 7 hour miniseries and condensing into a 108 minute is a big mistake.  The characters' motivation in the film version is questionable, because they've taken out big chunks of story.  But we're here to review the miniseries, not the misguided film version.The performances here are absolutely first rate, from Hoskins and Campbell, to Kenneth Colley as The Accordion Man, to Freddie Jones as a headmaster, and Hywel Bennett as a deeply cynical, cruel man who uses Campbell.  The miniseries has a rather disturbing tone to it for many reasons.  The songs that Potter uses are the cheery songs of the depression, which were in major contrast to what was really happening.  The songs are at first quite jarrring, but soon you get used to it, and realise it's a great narrative device.  Hoskins plays a sexual obsessive man who feels neglected at home, and the language is rather frank for its time.  The miniseries features an abortion, prostitution, murder, and just plain old fashioned cruelty of life.  One of the most memorable scenes is the farewell that Freddie Jones gives to Cheryl Campbell in the film.  Campbell teaches at a rural school, and she becomes pregnant by Hoskins.  Jones learns of this, but instead of doing a Puritannical thing on her, he is quite moving in his speech to her, realising that he cannot have her teaching at the school, despite the fact that he knows she's really a beautiful woman and a gentle soul who just made a stupid mistake.  The miniseries takes the viewer on quite a journey, and it's really one of the most unique experiences in TV ever made.  Potter was as much an auteur as any director, and he was one of the greatest teleplay writers the U.K. ever produced.  This and The Singing Detective are his legacy, and it's a great one.",5,One of the greatest miniseries ever made....,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,2247,"['long', 'time', 'ago', 'television', 'stations', 'would', 'take', 'great', 'chances', 'produce', 'TV', 'was', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'profound', 'one', 'examples', 'Dennis', 'Potter', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Singing', 'Detective', 'Potter', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'magnificent', 'worth', 'investing', '7', 'hours', 'so', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'version', 'film', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'taking', '7', 'hour', 'miniseries', 'condensing', '108', 'minute', 'big', 'mistake', 'characters', 'motivation', 'film', 'version', 'questionable', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'out', 'big', 'chunks', 'story', ""'re"", 'here', 'review', 'miniseries', 'not', 'misguided', 'film', 'version.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'absolutely', 'first', 'rate', 'Hoskins', 'Campbell', 'Kenneth', 'Colley', 'Accordion', 'Man', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'headmaster', 'Hywel', 'Bennett', 'deeply', 'cynical', 'cruel', 'man', 'who', 'Campbell', 'miniseries', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'tone', 'many', 'reasons', 'songs', 'Potter', 'uses', 'are', 'cheery', 'songs', 'depression', 'were', 'major', 'contrast', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'songs', 'are', 'first', 'quite', 'jarrring', 'soon', 'get', 'used', 'realise', 'great', 'narrative', 'device', 'Hoskins', 'sexual', 'obsessive', 'man', 'who', 'neglected', 'home', 'language', 'rather', 'frank', 'time', 'miniseries', 'abortion', 'prostitution', 'murder', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'fashioned', 'cruelty', 'life', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'farewell', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'Cheryl', 'Campbell', 'film', 'Campbell', 'rural', 'school', 'pregnant', 'Hoskins', 'Jones', 'instead', 'doing', 'Puritannical', 'thing', 'quite', 'moving', 'speech', 'realising', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'teaching', 'school', 'fact', 'really', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'gentle', 'soul', 'who', 'just', 'made', 'stupid', 'mistake', 'miniseries', 'viewer', 'journey', 'really', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'experiences', 'TV', 'ever', 'made', 'Potter', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'auteur', 'director', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'teleplay', 'U.K.', 'ever', 'produced', 'Singing', 'Detective', 'are', 'legacy', 'great', 'one']",Pennies from Heaven

Elaine Wood ""odd movie buff""","[12, 12]","This decidedly different 'musical' ain't gonna be to all tastes--but if you appreciate a genuinely offbeat concept superbly realised by a first-rate cast, this is for you.The principals, Bob Hoskins (as the loutish, megalomaniac Arthur Parker), Cheryl Crawford (as the at first winsome, then increasingly hard-boiled Eileen) and Gemma Craven (the hapless and resentful Joan) couldn't be better cast. The bizaare stylisations of the lip-synched musical numbers look positively effortless as handled by them. One can hardly imagine American actors being able to handle this kind of material with their level of ease and versatility.For me, the real test of this type of production isn't simply how well the leads carry it off--the secondary actors have to be equally good, or the whole thing comes apart. In this respect, especially, ""Pennies"" excels. Among the most notable of the supporting cast are two British character actors whose work I've admired for years, and who are sadly largely unknown to most audiences in this country. Hywel Bennett as Tom, a sleazy, yet oddly attractive pimp, brings the perfect aura of guttersnipe sexiness and low-bred self assurance to the part. He also, without ever once doing or saying anything overt, convinces the viewer that his character is a menacingly nasty bit of work--it's not at all hard to believe that Eileen would take it on the lam with Arthur rather than risk facing Tom once she's reneged on her deal with him. But for me, the most touching performance comes from the marvelous Freddie Jones, as the headmaster of the school where Eileen teaches. Initially introduced in a manner that suggests a typically English comic Dickensian villain, he transcends the viewer's expectations by being revealed as one of the few--possibly the only--decent characters in this story. Forced to dismiss Eileen over a compromising circumstance that has become known to the school's directors, he shows the sadness of his own disillusionment that has pushed him to treat his young charges with a certain brutality; and in a moment of beautifully underplayed pathos, almost inadvertently reveals his love for Eileen--a love he is well aware she could never(for any number of reasons) reciprocate. All he can do is offer her enough money to help her leave and re-establish herself elsewhere, and wish her good luck. As with Bennett, it's what's left unsaid and underplayed that makes his Headmaster Warner so painfully convincing.And there are any number of other small gems of performance; Ronald Fraser as a Blimpish member of Parliament who proves himself to be a lot cannier at the blackmail game than the hapless Eileen and Arthur is among the most notable. I can't think of a single poor performance by anyone in the cast--and in a cast of this size, that's no small feat.If you can get past the initial oddity of the concept, and if you're a fan of truly top-notch, fully realised acting --as opposed to the average histrionics that pass for acting in most American television performances--this strange (and strangely compelling) series is one you will not want to miss.",5,A marvel,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,3112,"['decidedly', 'different', ""'musical"", 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'tastes', 'appreciate', 'genuinely', 'offbeat', 'concept', 'superbly', 'realised', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'you.The', 'principals', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'loutish', 'megalomaniac', 'Arthur', 'Parker', 'Cheryl', 'Crawford', 'first', 'winsome', 'then', 'increasingly', 'hard-boiled', 'Eileen', 'Gemma', 'Craven', 'hapless', 'resentful', 'Joan', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'cast', 'bizaare', 'stylisations', 'lip-synched', 'musical', 'numbers', 'look', 'positively', 'effortless', 'handled', 'One', 'can', 'hardly', 'imagine', 'American', 'actors', 'being', 'able', 'handle', 'kind', 'material', 'level', 'ease', 'versatility.For', 'real', 'test', 'type', 'production', ""n't"", 'simply', 'how', 'well', 'leads', 'carry', 'off', 'secondary', 'actors', 'have', 'be', 'equally', 'good', 'whole', 'thing', 'apart', 'respect', 'especially', 'Pennies', 'excels', 'most', 'notable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'two', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'work', ""'ve"", 'admired', 'years', 'who', 'are', 'sadly', 'largely', 'unknown', 'most', 'audiences', 'country', 'Hywel', 'Bennett', 'Tom', 'sleazy', 'yet', 'oddly', 'attractive', 'pimp', 'perfect', 'aura', 'guttersnipe', 'sexiness', 'low-bred', 'self', 'assurance', 'part', 'also', 'ever', 'once', 'doing', 'saying', 'anything', 'overt', 'viewer', 'character', 'menacingly', 'nasty', 'bit', 'work', 'not', 'hard', 'believe', 'Eileen', 'would', 'take', 'lam', 'Arthur', 'rather', 'risk', 'facing', 'Tom', 'once', 'reneged', 'deal', 'most', 'touching', 'performance', 'marvelous', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'headmaster', 'school', 'where', 'Eileen', 'Initially', 'introduced', 'manner', 'typically', 'English', 'comic', 'Dickensian', 'villain', 'viewer', 'expectations', 'being', 'revealed', 'one', 'few', 'possibly', 'only', 'decent', 'characters', 'story', 'Forced', 'dismiss', 'Eileen', 'compromising', 'circumstance', 'become', 'known', 'school', 'directors', 'sadness', 'own', 'disillusionment', 'pushed', 'treat', 'young', 'charges', 'certain', 'brutality', 'moment', 'beautifully', 'underplayed', 'pathos', 'almost', 'inadvertently', 'love', 'Eileen', 'love', 'well', 'aware', 'could', 'never', 'number', 'reasons', 'reciprocate', 'can', 'do', 'offer', 'enough', 'money', 'help', 'leave', 're-establish', 'herself', 'elsewhere', 'wish', 'good', 'luck', 'Bennett', 'what', 'left', 'unsaid', 'underplayed', 'Headmaster', 'Warner', 'painfully', 'convincing.And', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'small', 'gems', 'performance', 'Ronald', 'Fraser', 'Blimpish', 'member', 'Parliament', 'who', 'be', 'lot', 'cannier', 'blackmail', 'game', 'hapless', 'Eileen', 'Arthur', 'most', 'notable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'poor', 'performance', 'anyone', 'cast', 'cast', 'size', 'small', 'feat.If', 'can', 'get', 'initial', 'oddity', 'concept', ""'re"", 'fan', 'truly', 'top-notch', 'fully', 'realised', 'acting', 'opposed', 'average', 'histrionics', 'pass', 'acting', 'most', 'American', 'television', 'performances', 'strange', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'series', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'miss']",Pennies from Heaven

It is a little slow at times and requires some patience to see it through. But the mixture of fantasy and cynical realism is utterly unique and fascinating. The series was shot at least partially on video and the lighting is often flat. It doesn't look nearly as good as the even older series ""The Prisoner"".
