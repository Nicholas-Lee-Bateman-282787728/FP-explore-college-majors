I was expecting the discs to be on pages with 2 discs a page like the other 2 season boxsets. The discs arent even labeled 1-8 so if you take out more than one to get down to the lower discs you could not only get them out of order and that end up being a pain but by the way this is set up its much easier to damage and scratch your discs up while taking them out because of being locked in tightly against each other.I know there is a version of this with pages and 2 discs a page just like the other 2 I have, I ordered it once but it was recieved so damaged that I had to return it from the discs being knocked out of the holders and scraped up too badly to watch.The show is really good, I love it even though season 3 seems a bit slower than the rest but its all still a good show.",4,Upset about the inner package setup,1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,925,"['bought', 'item', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'inside', '8', 'discs', 'were', 'stacked', 'right', 'top', 'other', 'single', 'disc', 'holding', 'slot', 'was', 'expecting', 'discs', 'be', 'pages', '2', 'discs', 'page', 'other', '2', 'season', 'boxsets', 'discs', 'arent', 'even', 'labeled', '1-8', 'so', 'take', 'out', 'more', 'one', 'get', 'down', 'lower', 'discs', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'order', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'pain', 'way', 'set', 'up', 'much', 'easier', 'damage', 'scratch', 'discs', 'up', 'taking', 'out', 'being', 'locked', 'tightly', 'other.I', 'know', 'version', 'pages', '2', 'discs', 'page', 'just', 'other', '2', 'have', 'ordered', 'once', 'was', 'recieved', 'so', 'damaged', 'had', 'return', 'discs', 'being', 'knocked', 'holders', 'scraped', 'up', 'too', 'badly', 'watch.The', 'show', 'really', 'good', 'love', 'even', 'season', '3', 'bit', 'slower', 'rest', 'still', 'good', 'show']",Rurouni Kenshin - TV Series Volume Three

The season starts off like Season 1, mini events that happen in Tokyo n Kenshin as always saves the da, also some comedic episodes. but then It gets a lil interesting when a guy name Shougo Amakusa comes by and is said to be the son of god. What makes it also interesting is dat he has also inherited the style of Hiten Mitsurugi (Kenshins exact Same Style). From that point it gets too religious with Christianity, It then gets a lil annoying and u wander when its gonna end and move on with the series. basically the series is all over the place, so basically get this if u absolutly luv Kenshin and want to see more.......",5,All Over the Place...........True Fans ONLY!!!!!!,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,688,"['season', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'got', 'be', 'da', 'weirdest', 'ones', 'season', 'Season', '1', 'mini', 'events', 'happen', 'Tokyo', 'n', 'Kenshin', 'always', 'da', 'also', 'comedic', 'episodes', 'then', 'lil', 'interesting', 'when', 'guy', 'name', 'Shougo', 'Amakusa', 'said', 'be', 'son', 'god', 'What', 'also', 'interesting', 'dat', 'also', 'inherited', 'style', 'Hiten', 'Mitsurugi', 'Kenshins', 'exact', 'Same', 'Style', 'point', 'too', 'religious', 'Christianity', 'then', 'lil', 'annoying', 'u', 'wander', 'when', 'gon', 'end', 'move', 'series', 'basically', 'series', 'place', 'so', 'basically', 'get', 'u', 'absolutly', 'luv', 'Kenshin', 'want', 'see', 'more']",Rurouni Kenshin - TV Series Volume Three
955531,AFV2584U13XP3,B000C6NP8Q,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]",While the series on whole might not be for everyone I'm sure once you give it a try you'll find yourself more and more entranced and entertained at the series in general.  The series primary character Kenshin and his group will face many adversities as well as personal choices both on their quests and in their final destination after it's all over.  While the series animation won't have the standard CGI effects we've seen with animes in the last ten years or so it's still drawn well and the soundtrack fits the series well.  If there is any complaint about the series in general it's that while the subbed cast did their roles very well sadly the dubbed cast weren't as good especially for some of Kenshin's friends as they didn't seem to put as much emotional feeling when saying their lines in the series.  The dvd case set itself is also annoying as it holds all seven dvds in one case with flaps that have the disc overlay with one atop another and if you're not careful removing the disc it could cause some scratches on those dvds.  At the end though a great and entertaining series awaits anyone willing to try out the series for themselves the only thing I do recommend is that you get the first box set before this one as you will get confused on what's happening and who the characters are of you don't....,5,Enjoyable For Fans Of Samurai Edo Era Sword Fighting Series With Endearing Characters,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,1321,"['series', 'whole', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'sure', 'give', 'try', ""'ll"", 'find', 'more', 'more', 'entranced', 'entertained', 'series', 'general', 'series', 'primary', 'character', 'Kenshin', 'group', 'will', 'face', 'many', 'adversities', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'choices', 'quests', 'final', 'destination', 'over', 'series', 'animation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'standard', 'CGI', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'animes', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'still', 'drawn', 'well', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'well', 'complaint', 'series', 'general', 'subbed', 'cast', 'did', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'sadly', 'dubbed', 'cast', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'especially', 'Kenshin', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'put', 'as', 'much', 'emotional', 'feeling', 'when', 'saying', 'lines', 'series', 'dvd', 'case', 'set', 'also', 'annoying', 'seven', 'dvds', 'one', 'case', 'flaps', 'have', 'disc', 'overlay', 'one', 'atop', ""'re"", 'not', 'careful', 'removing', 'disc', 'could', 'cause', 'scratches', 'dvds', 'end', 'great', 'entertaining', 'series', 'anyone', 'willing', 'try', 'out', 'series', 'only', 'thing', 'do', 'recommend', 'get', 'first', 'box', 'set', 'one', 'will', 'get', 'confused', 'what', 'happening', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'do', ""n't""]",Rurouni Kenshin - TV Series Volume Three
