198396,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300181227,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Dragnet, 1954 filmOn a Friday afternoon Sgt. Joe Friday and the police talk about the recent daylight murder in a park. The physical evidence tells what happened. Two men walked into a park and one was shot in ambush. The police check the suspects. The Intelligence Department keeps track of criminals. Suspects are brought in to a hotel for questioning in privacy. These rooms are bugged. A note from the victim has a telephone number for a suspect, Max Troy. He is uncooperative. Sgt. Friday questions him. Troy suggests the victim was involved with the wrong woman. The conversation is interesting, and unusual these days. Suspects were kept and questioned for unlimited times without a lawyer present. They hear about an eyewitness, he looks at pictures and picks out the man he saw leaving that field. The detectives visit the ""Red Spot"" caf&eacute; to check on alibis. Writs of Habeas Corpus are issued to free the suspects.A policewoman will work undercover with a miniature wire recorder. Its about the size of a paperback novel. The murder scene is searched with test equipment. ""Why does the law always work for the guilty?"" ""The innocent don't need it."" Friday and Smith visit a restaurant. The murder victim used to collect debts for Las Vegas gamblers. He was beaten up a month ago, a warning? They talk to Miller Starkie's wife, she doesn't say much except to mention ""Max Troy"". She hands them a notebook, then walks them to the door. Friday and Smith begin to check out those names. One is a theatrical producer. ""But she can't sing."" They get a clue that Miller Starkie was holding out. The telephone company gives up a list of long-distance calls made by the suspects. [No court order?] That recording provides information. They learn that Chester Davit has been found. He walks out of his home to the police. His right shoe matched the exemplar.Friday and Smith visit the museum. The eyewitness is now hesitant about his identification. The Grand Jury meets. Sgt. Friday testifies about the telephone calls. What do they know about the conversations? There was no indictment; not enough evidence without that eyewitness. The suspects are followed around the clock. We see this technique working. People stop to watch. [Note the pack of Chesterfields cigarettes.] ""Goodnight Max."" Friday and Smith visit a social club. There is a fist fight; blood flows. The police put a bug in the ""Red Spot"" office. They find a box of discarded 12-gauge shells. Four shells missing! Later they listen to a ""Red Spot"" telephone call and learn about Davit. This recording is played for a witness, who gives information about the missing shotgun, and where it was bought. The District Attorney now says ""you got him"". Will the suspect be arrested now? A technicality prevents the arrest for an ironic ending.""Dragnet"", first a radio show then a TV show, was a big hit in the early 1950s. It pioneered the programs which produced details about police procedures. There was not much dramatic action, rarely shooting and violence. ""Just the facts, ma'am."" Jack Webb was a lab technician in the movie ""He Walked by Night"" which was based on a true crime. It was unlike the earlier ""film noir"" movies which were based on personal emotion. The series of ""CSI"" TV shows show the audience the work behind the scenes. Some say the techniques shown on ""CSI"" are very dramatic and do not represent actual reality. That is also true about the profiling (an educated guess) shown on TV (""Criminal Minds"").

198397,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,6300181227,Adam,"[9, 9]","This is Sgt. Friday in living color in 1950s form before the middle age paunch of the 1960s. It's Sergeant Friday in a show that mixes Dragnet with the fast-paced Noir writing that made Webb's Private Detective show, Pat Novak for Hire (written by screenwriter Richard Breen,) a classic.1) Picture Quality was superb: I've seen this on an old rental VHS and the difference is night and day. The color is crisp and stunning. This is a good print that Universal used.2) The Story is not your ordinary Dragnet. This film would be considered a minor noir classic if it weren't based on a TV show. In many ways it deviates with a fist fight in a bridge hall and the lack of banter between Friday and Smith. As well, Friday is a little more aggressive and on-edge than normally written. This is because Breen didn't write for Dragnet. It's very similar to the normal Dragnet, but with a greater hard boiled punch to it that makes it interesting. It also fits that Friday would be a little tougher as he's dealing with underworld hoods throughout the whole thing, and not Mrs. Garrity, the grey-haired landlady. Just because it's different, doesn't make it bad or unfitting for the canon. It's actually a well-made and distinct film.3) The Dialogue is a Work of Art. This is Friday at his toughest, delivering lines such as, ""Unless you're growin', Sit down! "" to a hood trying to start something.Friday is tough and ready for action in a forgotten classic that is a must see for fans of Dragnet, NOIR, or detective fiction.",5,"Unless you're growin', Sit down!",1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,1517,"['Sgt', 'Friday', 'living', 'color', '1950s', 'form', 'middle', 'age', 'paunch', '1960s', 'Sergeant', 'Friday', 'show', 'mixes', 'Dragnet', 'fast-paced', 'Noir', 'writing', 'made', 'Webb', 'Private', 'Detective', 'show', 'Pat', 'Novak', 'Hire', 'written', 'screenwriter', 'Richard', 'Breen', 'classic.1', 'Picture', 'Quality', 'was', 'superb', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'old', 'rental', 'VHS', 'difference', 'night', 'day', 'color', 'crisp', 'stunning', 'good', 'print', 'Universal', 'used.2', 'Story', 'not', 'ordinary', 'Dragnet', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'minor', 'noir', 'classic', 'were', ""n't"", 'based', 'TV', 'show', 'many', 'ways', 'fist', 'fight', 'bridge', 'hall', 'lack', 'banter', 'Friday', 'Smith', 'As', 'well', 'Friday', 'little', 'more', 'aggressive', 'on-edge', 'normally', 'written', 'Breen', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'Dragnet', 'very', 'similar', 'normal', 'Dragnet', 'greater', 'hard', 'boiled', 'punch', 'interesting', 'also', 'Friday', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'tougher', 'dealing', 'underworld', 'hoods', 'whole', 'thing', 'not', 'Mrs.', 'Garrity', 'grey-haired', 'landlady', 'Just', 'different', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'unfitting', 'canon', 'actually', 'well-made', 'distinct', 'film.3', 'Dialogue', 'Work', 'Art', 'Friday', 'toughest', 'delivering', 'lines', 'such', ""'re"", 'growin', 'Sit', 'down', 'hood', 'trying', 'start', 'something.Friday', 'tough', 'ready', 'action', 'forgotten', 'classic', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'Dragnet', 'NOIR', 'detective', 'fiction']",Dragnet VHS
198398,A3KNGA5WIECM5V,6300181227,"Beth Fox ""Beth A. Fox""","[40, 44]","Those of us who grew up with and loved the 1960s version of Dragnet are in for a pleasant surprise.  The 1950s version is grittier, more true-to-life, and even more ""no-nonsense"" than the later series.  The black-and-white photography makes everything look downbeat and harder, and truly portrays the underside of society, rather than sunny Los Angeles.  It's detectives in hats, records in pen and ink, milk in bottles, and cigarettes everywhere. High-tech means sending out a ""radiogram.""  You don't get Friday lecturing hippies, but the 1950s series is, in my opinion, better.I have many original Dragnet episodes on VHS, but this DVD set is quite a buy.  Although some of the episodes have incorrect titles, you cannot beat the price.  Fans of the 1960s series will enjoy seeing a rather young Virginia Gregg, a very young Peggy Webber, as well as Art Gilmore, Harry Bartell, a very young Bill Boyett (Sgt. MacDonald on Adam-12), Natalie Masters and assorted other actors who formed Jack Webb's unofficial company of players.  There are some classic episodes here.I noticed that one reviewer posted the list of episodes that you get in this set, but here is a brief explanation of each of them:Disk 1, Side A1. The Big September -- A woman is murdered by a religious fanatic.2. The Big Seventeen -- Episode starts with the destruction of a movie theatre by kids on drugs.  The 17-year old in question ruins his life by taking heroin.  (Note: this boy would have been born in 1935 -- long before the hippie generation.  Webb tackled drug use long before it was commonplace.)3. The Big Show (should really be the ""Big Secret"") -- a young Virginia Gregg plays the wife of an army officer.  While taking an interstate bus trip, a young woman handed the officer's wife a baby, and said she would be back.  When the young mother did not arrive, Friday and Smith investigate.  This is one of the best episodes on this DVD set.  A must watch!4. The Big Break -- A guy arrested for robbery breaks out of county jail and then an army jail.  Lots of action in this episode.5. The Big Hands -- A woman's body is found in a hotel room.  Friday and Smith have to find out who she is, who killed her, and why.  A young Olan Soule is a lab technician, a role that he would reprise in the 1960s Dragnets.Disc 1, Side B1. The Big Betty -- Thieves scan the obituary columns, then sell relatives of the deceased worthless merchandise.  The last crook is nabbed at a New Year's Eve party. Classic lines:  Crook: Evey year, New Year's Eve, I cry.  Never had any reason for it.  Friday: You're going to have one this year, lady.2. The Big Thief -- A couple of crooks were robbing doctors at hotels. This is the most personal episode, as it shows Friday's reaction to killing a suspect, and his girlfriend comforts him. One of the best episodes in the DVD set!3. The Big Little Jesus -- Those who have seen the 1960s series will recognize this one, as the 1960s version was just redone in color.  A baby Jesus is missing from the oldest downtown church.  Harry Bartell plays the priest.4. The Big Trunk (really, the Big Bird)-- a burglar breaks into homes in new developments in the San Fernando Valley (which you can buy for $500 down!) and kills any pet birds he finds.  Classic lines:  Crook: I don't feel sorry for something just 'cause it's locked up.  Friday (snapping on the handcuffs): You might.5. The Big Boys -- Four boys, including a very young Leonard Nimoy, go on a robbery spree.Disc 2, Side A1. The Big Shoplift -- The detectives investigate a series of shoplifts of department stores.  A young Peggy Webber plays a doctor's wife.2. The Big Hit-Run Killer -- An elderly woman and her grandson are killed by a hit-and-run driver.  With few clues, Friday must track down who it is.3. The Big Girls -- Motorists are being robbed by different large, attractive women. Friday and Smith get the case.4. The Big Frame -- Friday and Smith track down the killer of a man who apparently had died in a hit-and-run -- or was there another cause of the death?  And who had killed him?  The victim's girlfriend is played by a very young Carolyn Jones.5. The Big Producer -- A very young Martin Milner (Malloy on Adam-12) peddles pornographic photos to his high school friends; Friday then has to find and arrest the producer of pornographic movies.  I'm surprised this was shown on TV in 1952.Disc 2, Side B1. The Big Crime -- This was indeed a big crime.  Two four-year-old twin girls were kidnapped and sexually molested.  Again, it is amazing that this was shown on TV in the early 1950s.2. The Big Pair (should be ""The Big Housekeeping"") -- A couple completely strip homes of their furnishings while the owners are on vacation.3. The Big Bar -- A killer keeps murdering bar owners.  He has the unusual habit of playing one song over and over on the juke box.4. The Big War -- Friday tries to prevent a juvenile gang war.  The episode features Natalie Masters as a doting mother who refuses to believe her darling son could be up to any trouble.  This is a role she would repeat in the 1960s Dragnet series.5. The Big Oskar -- A man comes into the police station claiming that he knows where stolen goods are and who stole them.This is a great deal.  I only wish they would bring out all the black and white episodes on DVD, season by season.",5,"Dragnet -- The First, The Best -- Jack Webb lives!",1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,5327,"['who', 'grew',

198400,A2UMVE2RU74VFR,6300181227,Chris Jackson,"[7, 7]","I found this 2 disc set of 20 Dragnet episodes very enjoyable.  The quality ranges from fair to very good, as some episodes show more wear and tear, grain, and scratches than others, especially ""The Big Show"", which has some print damage early on in the show.  All the episodes are watchable and most of them are in very good shape, showing crystal clear images, but as in good shape as some of these episodes are, I doubt these were remastered, ""in Virtual 5.1"", as it states on the back of the DVD.  However, for $11.66 + tax (which is what I paid for it at Wal-Mart) it's more than worth the money, as 20 divided by the price  comes out to 58 cents an episode!. The stories, while somewhat dated today,  are very entertaining, all the more so because they are based on true cases. Jack Webb's direction is excellent and his actors were very natural in their performances.  Check out some very famous people in some of these episodes, among them Martin Milner in ""The Big Producer"", Leonard Nimoy  in ""The Big Boys""  Carolyn Jones, later Mortica on ""The Addams Family"", in ""The Big Girl"", ""The Big Frame"" and ""The Big Producer"", and finally, Dennis Weaver shows up in ""The Big Bar"" as a forensic pathologist!. By the way, the episode ""The Big Trunk"" was mislabelled on the DVD and menu actually is ""The Big Bird"".  Despite all of this though,  I would still  highly recommend  this DVD to others with an interest in Dragnet and how crime was fought in the 1950's.  Finally, I feel that these Dragnet episodes should be digitally restored as Dragnet was a landmark TV series which inspired shows like ""Adam 12"" and ""Emergency"", (both created by Jack Webb) as well as  ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""Law &amp; Order"" .",4,Dum De Dum Dum&#65533;Great set of Dragnet episodes!,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,1712,"['found', '2', 'disc', 'set', '20', 'Dragnet', 'episodes', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'quality', 'fair', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'show', 'more', 'wear', 'tear', 'grain', 'scratches', 'others', 'especially', 'Big', 'Show', 'print', 'damage', 'early', 'show', 'episodes', 'are', 'watchable', 'most', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'showing', 'crystal', 'clear', 'images', 'good', 'shape', 'episodes', 'are', 'doubt', 'were', 'remastered', 'Virtual', '5.1', 'back', 'DVD', 'However', '11.66', '+', 'tax', 'what', 'paid', 'Wal-Mart', 'more', 'money', '20', 'divided', 'price', '58', 'cents', 'episode', 'stories', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'today', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'more', 'so', 'are', 'based', 'true', 'cases', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'direction', 'excellent', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'natural', 'performances', 'Check', 'out', 'very', 'famous', 'people', 'episodes', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'Big', 'Producer', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Big', 'Boys', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'later', 'Mortica', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Big', 'Girl', 'Big', 'Frame', 'Big', 'Producer', 'finally', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'up', 'Big', 'Bar', 'forensic', 'pathologist', 'way', 'episode', 'Big', 'Trunk', 'was', 'mislabelled', 'DVD', 'menu', 'actually', 'Big', 'Bird', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'others', 'interest', 'Dragnet', 'how', 'crime', 'was', 'fought', '1950', 'Finally', 'feel', 'Dragnet', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'digitally', 'restored', 'Dragnet', 'was', 'landmark', 'TV', 'series', 'inspired', 'shows', 'Adam', '12', 'Emergency', 'created', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'as', 'well', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Law', 'amp', 'Order']",Dragnet VHS
198401,A3E0IFPCA7KKP9,6300181227,Christopher J. Martin,"[1, 1]","I've loved Dragnet ever since I saw re-runs of the 1960s early 70s color version many years ago on television. Technology's allowed me to watch many (maybe all?) of the black & white versions and I've listened to almost all of the available radio episodes. I love this show but I hadn't seen the 1954 movie. In fact I didn't even know about it until recently.The plot is much like the Dragnet episodes but strung out longer to be able to comprise a full movie rather than just a 30-minute TV episode. There's a killing of a ""small time hood"" in an LA park so Friday and Smith have to investigate and find the killer. The dialogue is what you'd expect from the 50s black & white version. Jack Webb's character Joe Friday narrates and has a few rants against suspects too. The movie makes use of technology like a mini tape recorder that was probably very new to movie goers in the 1950s. Seeing how they used technology that was brand new 60 years ago but is hopelessly outdated now is fun.Overall, a very good movie and one that all Dragnet fans should see.",5,Great Movie for a Dragnet Fan,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,1057,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'Dragnet', 'ever', 'saw', 're-runs', '1960s', 'early', '70s', 'color', 'version', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'television', 'Technology', 'allowed', 'watch', 'many', 'maybe', 'black', 'white', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'almost', 'available', 'radio', 'episodes', 'love', 'show', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', '1954', 'movie', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'recently.The', 'plot', 'much', 'Dragnet', 'episodes', 'out', 'longer', 'be', 'able', 'comprise', 'full', 'movie', 'rather', 'just', '30-minute', 'TV', 'episode', 'killing', 'small', 'time', 'hood', 'LA', 'park', 'so', 'Friday', 'Smith', 'have', 'investigate', 'find', 'killer', 'dialogue', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', '50s', 'black', 'white', 'version', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'character', 'Joe', 'Friday', 'narrates', 'few', 'rants', 'suspects', 'too', 'movie', 'use', 'technology', 'mini', 'tape', 'recorder', 'was', 'probably', 'very', 'new', 'movie', 'goers', '1950s', 'Seeing', 'how', 'used', 'technology', 'was', 'brand', 'new', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'hopelessly', 'outdated', 'now', 'fun.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'Dragnet', 'fans', 'should', 'see']",Dragnet VHS

As a kid I caught the original series in syndication and was immediately hooked. I loved the Dragnet comeback in the 60s, but was disappointed in that it went from strict crime solving to a cultural critique was was often unintentionally funny. I would often ask whatever happened to the original. It waasn't long before I found out: being in the Land of B/W, it was to be forever lost in the Brave New World of Color. Every now and then, a couple of episodes would be released on DVD, usually the same episodes. To someone discovering them for the first time, it would seem beyond the pale that 276 30-minute episodes were filmed between 1950 and 1959.This 20-episode collection of ""Dragnet"" is a good start, bringing back the flavor and impact of the original. The technicalities aren't the greatest -- some episodes were shown as ""Badge 714"", the syndicaion title. But Who Cares?? They're all watchable, and enjoyable. Fans of the 60s version will find much to see in these earlier episodes. The perfection of the staccato dialogue (""How's that?"" ""I see.""

Penna,"[9, 9]","Ignore any reviews dated before 2010 as Amazon has, at least as of this date, mistakenly assigned them to this product, which was not issued until Jan. 10, 2010. As jrc ""jrcasey"" has already pointed out, those old reviews are for public-domain compilations of episodes of the ""Dragnet"" TV series. I agree with his comments about the quality of this DVD of the 1954 feature film. Appears to be a recent transfer from an excellent-quality film element. Even the opticals (fade-ins, fade-outs and dissolves between scenes, accomplished by re-photographing the original negative) are in better shape than is often seen in films of this vintage. While the film itself isn't quite all I'd hoped it would be - for one thing, I was wishing for less back lot photography and more on location - there's plenty to drink in if you appreciate time-capsule looks into early-fifties culture: the clothes, the cars, the technology, all in color.

This as I thought was an expanded story of the TV series and also gave the TV show a great boost in the arm.  I thought this story was well done for the big screen.  Production quality of the move was well done by the producers and the star.

Here's why . . .1. Quantity - The 20 episodes included on this set represent the largest single collection of original Dragnet episodes released to date (August 2003).2. Price/Value - At a retail of [$$ it is amazing].3. Variety - There are some very well-known (and ""common"") episodes included like The Big Seventeen and The Big Producer, but there are some rarer episodes and one, The Big Frame, has not previously appeared on DVD.  Since Amazon did not list the episode titles, I am including them below for Dragnet fans so that you can compare this collection of episodes with others:Episodes - Disc 1/Side A1. The Big September Man2. The Big Seventeen3. The Big Show4. The Big Break5. The Big HandsEpisodes - Disc 1/Side B1. The Big Betty2. The Big Thief3. The Big Little Jesus4. The Big Bird (mislabeled incorrectly on rear cover and the disc menu as The Big Trunk)5. The Big BoysEpisodes - Disc 2/Side A1. The Big Shoplift2. The Big Hit-Run Killer3. The Big Girl4. The Big Frame5. The Big ProducerEpisodes - Disc 2/Side B1. The Big Crime2. The Big Pair3. The Big Bar4. The Big War5. The Big OskarMy five star rating is closer to four & one-half stars as this collection is not ""problem free.""  While all of the episodes range, visually, from fair to very good, there has been no digital restoration of the prints utilized for this collection.  All episodes are watchable, just don't expect to see pristine prints . . . you can expect some film scratches and specks.  Audio is very good on almost all of the episodes.  The episode ""The Big War"" is of noticeably lesser visual quality than the other episodes.  There are no DVD ""extras,"" but you can access individual episodes through a menu option.  What shines through on this set is the brilliance of Jack Webb . . . even though most of the episodes were made 50 years ago, the documentary style approach that Webb employed to tell these stories is still better than most of today's television police shows.

This is the full length feature movie that was released in 1954 in color and what this review is written about. (that is the movie which is listed above).Dragnet (1954)I am not sure but I would guess that this movie was released in theaters and also on TV at the same time to coincide with the new color TV's that were just introduced that same year in March of 1954 by Westinghouse with model H840CK15 and April 1954 by RCA with model CT-100. I would guess that this was also released in theaters as well as TV because at the time color TV was brand new and very expensive with a small audience. The new Westinghouse H840CK15 retailed for $1,295 and the RCA CT-100 was $1000, that is 1954 dollars!I mention all that to put the release of this movie in perspective and to say that is what makes watching this movie so great! I am a big fan of Dragnet and have seen every original black and white TV episode that is in the public domain on the internet archive as well as listened to many of the over 300 original radio series episodes also available free on the internet archive.Seeing everything in color including; the cars, neon lights and signs, city hall police department, and all the clothing including suits (grey or tweed with colored ties) and women's dresses made me feel like I was in a time capsule seeing what life was really like in the 1950's, and more importantly what things really looked like in the original Dragnet series, if it had been in color.Boy, people knew how to dress then, and we have surly lost something.I won't put in any spoilers and tell the story but the story has an emphasis on ""pounding the pavement"" and following up many dead end leads highlighting the hard police work that Jack Webb always wanted to convey to his watchers. It is not at all a cut and dry case, and at first I was a little surprised Jack picked this story to make into a full length film. There were TV episodes that were far more dramatic and climactic that he could have used, but the more I thought about Jack Webb and how he loved to promote the hard work of the police to the public without all the glamour it really makes sense he chose this story.It is well worth watching and I would highly recommend it to any Dragnet fan, if not only just to see it in color!",5,Dragnet (1954) Full length feature movie prime video,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,2477,"['Not', 'sure', 'why', 'reviews', 'Dragnet', '1954', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'movie', 'are', 'DVD', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'TV', 'show', 'Anyway', 'just', 'rented', 'watched', 'Dragnet', '1954', 'instant', 'video', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1954', 'color', 'what', 'review', 'written', 'movie', 'listed', '.Dragnet', '1954', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'also', 'TV', 'same', 'time', 'coincide', 'new', 'color', 'TV', 'were', 'just', 'introduced', 'same', 'year', 'March', '1954', 'Westinghouse', 'model', 'H840CK15', 'April', '1954', 'RCA', 'model', 'CT-100', 'would', 'guess', 'was', 'also', 'released', 'theaters', 'as', 'well', 'TV', 'time', 'color', 'TV', 'was', 'brand', 'new', 'very', 'expensive', 'small', 'audience', 'new', 'Westinghouse', 'H840CK15', 'retailed', '1,295', 'RCA', 'CT-100', 'was', '1000', '1954', 'dollars', 'mention', 'put', 'release', 'movie', 'perspective', 'say', 'what', 'watching', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Dragnet', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'episode', 'public', 'domain', 'internet', 'archive', 'as', 'well', 'listened', 'many', '300', 'original', 'radio', 'series', 'episodes', 'also', 'available', 'free', 'internet', 'archive.Seeing', 'everything', 'color', 'including', 'cars', 'neon', 'lights', 'signs', 'city', 'hall', 'police', 'department', 'clothing', 'including', 'suits', 'grey', 'tweed', 'colored', 'ties', 'women', 'dresses', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'time', 'capsule', 'seeing', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'really', 'like', '1950', 'more', 'importantly', 'what', 'things', 'really', 'looked', 'original', 'Dragnet', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'color.Boy', 'people', 'knew', 'how', 'dress', 'then', 'have', 'surly', 'lost', 'something.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'spoilers', 'tell', 'story', 'story', 'emphasis', 'pounding', 'pavement', 'following', 'up', 'many', 'dead', 'end', 'highlighting', 'hard', 'police', 'work', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'always', 'wanted', 'convey', 'watchers', 'not', 'cut', 'dry', 'case', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'Jack', 'picked', 'story', 'make', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'were', 'TV', 'episodes', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic', 'climactic', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'thought', 'about', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'how', 'loved', 'promote', 'hard', 'work', 'police', 'public', 'glamour', 'really', 'sense', 'chose', 'story.It', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Dragnet', 'fan', 'not', 'only', 'just', 'see', 'color']",Dragnet VHS
