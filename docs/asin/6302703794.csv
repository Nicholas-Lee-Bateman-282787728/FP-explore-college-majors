It deals with courage, humanity, and challenging a country's restrictions.Six people including four Jews, a German soldier deserter and a young French boy escape Germany and they enter Switzerland for safety - their lives!They come across an innkeeper, Anna Franz, who instructs the group that Switzerland will take refugees, but they must comply to the restrictions that entail asylum to a family with children under 6.  They formulate a plan to resemble a family.  However, the groups faces one challenging aspect, the youngest boy is French and does not speak German and it is critical that he not speak!To further the challenges, Judith, who poses as the mother and wife, has her real husband pursuing her as he left a Swiss refugee camp.  Plus, Anna, the innkeeper, is up against her own husband, who is frightened of the mascarade unfolding.This film is suspenseful and heartening and like any other Holocaust film, it exudes the ultimate sadness.  It was nominated for an Oscar in 1982 for Best Foreign Film.  ......RizzoI recommend an amazing Jewish Halocaust film, through the eyes of a teen:Fateless",5,Courage and Humanity,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,1210,"['Filmed', 'Switzerland', '1981', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'more', 'Holocaust', 'drama', 'courage', 'humanity', 'challenging', 'country', 'restrictions.Six', 'people', 'including', 'four', 'Jews', 'German', 'soldier', 'deserter', 'young', 'French', 'boy', 'escape', 'Germany', 'enter', 'Switzerland', 'safety', 'lives', 'come', 'innkeeper', 'Anna', 'Franz', 'who', 'group', 'Switzerland', 'will', 'take', 'refugees', 'must', 'comply', 'restrictions', 'entail', 'asylum', 'family', 'children', '6', 'formulate', 'plan', 'resemble', 'family', 'However', 'groups', 'one', 'challenging', 'aspect', 'youngest', 'boy', 'French', 'not', 'speak', 'German', 'critical', 'not', 'speak', 'further', 'challenges', 'Judith', 'who', 'mother', 'wife', 'real', 'husband', 'pursuing', 'left', 'Swiss', 'refugee', 'camp', 'Anna', 'innkeeper', 'up', 'own', 'husband', 'who', 'frightened', 'mascarade', 'unfolding.This', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'heartening', 'other', 'Holocaust', 'film', 'ultimate', 'sadness', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '1982', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'RizzoI', 'recommend', 'amazing', 'Jewish', 'Halocaust', 'film', 'eyes', 'teen', 'Fateless']",The Boat is Full VHS

As the story unfolded, I first resented but then really hated him, even though he was onlycarrying out his government's orders. Still, he seems very glad to do so. (I wonder if he, too, isbased on a real-life figure.) The part that truly horrified me came right at the beginning. I won'tspoil the moment for anyone, but those who have seen the film will know what I mean--the older womanwho puts her hat on with an indecipherable expression on her face. Did that part, too, reallyhappen? What one takes away from the movie, in the end, is a horror not of the sadism involved but ofthe blithe attitude with which the sadists operate. There's no passion, no psychopathology. Just...following orders. One odd note--the old man was played by Curt Bois, whom buffs of old Hollywoodmovies recall as a comic character actor.

328397,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6302703794,Randy Keehn,"[3, 3]","I noticed a couple of very negative reviews of ""The Boat is Full"" and I admit that this movie is rather unique.  However, I was very impressed with this film once I had seen it to its' completion.  It lacks any sort of action or compelling characterization.  I was able to watch ""The Boat is Full"" sitting way back in my seat and at no time found myself at the edge of it.  The setting and dialogue could have easily been transposed successfully into an on-stage production.  What makes it so impressive is the glimpse it gives us of the general European apathy to the plight of Jews in Nazi Germany and, specifically, to the plight of refugees.  Years ago I read the book ""While Six Million Died"" which detailed the ""problem"" of Jewish emigrees in the early and middle years of Hitler's Germany.  The basic problem was that nobody wanted them.  (The book underscored America's shameless participation in that apathy).  There is a centuries-old anti-Semitism in Europe that most Americans don't comprehend.  I'm no expert on the subject so I won't attempt to explain nor justify this but we get a sense of it from the various comments heard in ""The Boat is Full"".We encounter a mixture of refugees who are only looking for a haven from the madness that they left behind in German occupied Europe.  They have made it to Switzerland but that doesn't mean that their ordeal is over.  To counteract the large influx of refugees, Switzerland has its' own set of rules as to who can stay and who gets sent back.  Getting sent back is almost the same as a death sentence which the viewers understand.  The chess game of desperate moves is the essence of the movie.  Kudos to director Marcus Imhoof for giving us a cast of (under the circumstances) everyday characters.  We are not drawn generally to anyone in particular.  These people have their negatives and, in some cases, their postives but there is no genius, beauty, or hero amongst them.  Because of that, we end up assessing the situation without being led along by the script of direction.  We know who's right and who's wrong but the greatness of ""The Boat is Full"" is its' focus on the gray areas.",4,Understanding Apathy,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,2152,"['noticed', 'couple', 'very', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Boat', 'Full', 'admit', 'movie', 'rather', 'unique', 'However', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'film', 'once', 'had', 'seen', 'completion', 'sort', 'action', 'compelling', 'characterization', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'Boat', 'Full', 'sitting', 'way', 'back', 'seat', 'time', 'found', 'edge', 'setting', 'dialogue', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'transposed', 'successfully', 'on-stage', 'production', 'What', 'so', 'impressive', 'glimpse', 'general', 'European', 'apathy', 'plight', 'Jews', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'specifically', 'plight', 'refugees', 'Years', 'read', 'book', 'Six', 'Million', 'Died', 'detailed', 'problem', 'Jewish', 'emigrees', 'early', 'middle', 'years', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'basic', 'problem', 'was', 'nobody', 'wanted', 'book', 'underscored', 'America', 'shameless', 'participation', 'apathy', 'centuries-old', 'anti-Semitism', 'Europe', 'most', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'comprehend', ""'m"", 'expert', 'subject', 'wo', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'explain', 'justify', 'get', 'sense', 'various', 'comments', 'heard', 'Boat', 'Full', '.We', 'encounter', 'mixture', 'refugees', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'looking', 'haven', 'madness', 'left', 'behind', 'German', 'occupied', 'Europe', 'have', 'made', 'Switzerland', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ordeal', 'over', 'counteract', 'large', 'influx', 'refugees', 'Switzerland', 'own', 'set', 'rules', 'who', 'can', 'stay', 'who', 'sent', 'back', 'Getting', 'sent', 'back', 'almost', 'same', 'death', 'sentence', 'viewers', 'understand', 'chess', 'game', 'desperate', 'moves', 'essence', 'movie', 'Kudos', 'director', 'Marcus', 'Imhoof', 'giving', 'cast', 'circumstances', 'everyday', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'drawn', 'generally', 'anyone', 'particular', 'people', 'have', 'negatives', 'cases', 'postives', 'genius', 'beauty', 'hero', 'amongst', 'end', 'up', 'assessing', 'situation', 'being', 'led', 'script', 'direction', 'know', 'who', 'right', 'who', 'wrong', 'greatness', 'Boat', 'Full', 'focus', 'gray', 'areas']",The Boat is Full VHS
