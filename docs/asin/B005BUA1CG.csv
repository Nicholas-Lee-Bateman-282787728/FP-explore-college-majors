I wanted to the be first person to review this new re-release of Jem and the Holograms.Anyways, this is a great series and it is such a throw back that it reminds me of Madonna and Culture Club. The 80's had some really great music and Britta's voice (Jem's singing voice) is amazing. The show centers around, Erica Benton, who has just lost her father. He owns a record label, but upon his death, Raymond (I guess co-CEO) assumes control of the company and intends on making 'The Misfits' singing group a rock sensation. Erica receives a gift in the very first episode in the form of red-glittered-ear rings. She soon discovers the power of the ear rings that her father left her. Adventure soon starts and so does addictive pop music. Each episode features three new songs from either Jem, the Misfits, etc.For some reason, i only found season one to be enjoyable. The other seasons seem to be going out in left field with ideas that just seem so random and just don't jive with me. Initially this was released back in 2006 i believe, but the final box set was never released due to music rights (That's what i heard on the internet blogs), but who knows if that is true. Now it seems another company has brought JEM and will be releasing the series in its entire glory. Despite the fact that the other seasons aren't as exciting as the first, this is still a great series and brings back many fond and warm memories.",5,Another Taste of Something Great from the 80's.,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,1452,"['DAMN', 'everyone', 'beat', 'punch', 'wanted', 'be', 'first', 'person', 'review', 'new', 're-release', 'Jem', 'Holograms.Anyways', 'great', 'series', 'such', 'throw', 'back', 'Madonna', 'Culture', 'Club', '80', 'had', 'really', 'great', 'music', 'Britta', 'voice', 'Jem', 'singing', 'voice', 'amazing', 'show', 'around', 'Erica', 'Benton', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'father', 'record', 'label', 'death', 'Raymond', 'guess', 'co-CEO', 'control', 'company', 'making', ""'The"", 'Misfits', 'singing', 'group', 'rock', 'sensation', 'Erica', 'gift', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'form', 'red-glittered-ear', 'rings', 'soon', 'power', 'ear', 'rings', 'father', 'left', 'Adventure', 'soon', 'starts', 'so', 'addictive', 'pop', 'music', 'episode', 'three', 'new', 'songs', 'Jem', 'Misfits', 'reason', 'i', 'only', 'found', 'season', 'one', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'seasons', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'left', 'field', 'ideas', 'just', 'seem', 'so', 'random', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'jive', 'Initially', 'was', 'released', 'back', '2006', 'i', 'believe', 'final', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'due', 'music', 'rights', 'what', 'heard', 'internet', 'blogs', 'who', 'true', 'Now', 'company', 'brought', 'JEM', 'will', 'be', 'releasing', 'series', 'entire', 'glory', 'fact', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'exciting', 'first', 'still', 'great', 'series', 'back', 'many', 'fond', 'warm', 'memories']",Jem and the Holograms: The Truly Outrageous Complete Series

Now since there has to be an enemy, there are The Misfits and The Stingers who are always trying to steal from Jem and her friends.  Oh and did I mention that Jem has a dual personality where she turns from Jerrica to Jem through using the power of Synergy!

1452792,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B005BUA1CG,Garrett Aja,"[25, 28]","The great Marvel/Sunbow cartoon shows of the '80s have had a rough time on DVD. The Rhino DVDs (save for a couple of single-disc releases of The Transformers and The Inhumanoids) were rife with incorrect footage and digitally altered footage, as well as a bit of censorship in one episode of G.I. Joe. And Jem and G.I. Joe didn't even rate full releases before Rhino lost the home video rights. Shout! factory then promised to fix things, but The Transformers still has many, many errors, and G.I. Joe was unchanged from the partial Rhino release (and there were even more things wrong with the episodes new to DVD).Now, we have Jem. As with the recent reruns on The Hub, Shout! Factory has completely discarded the Rhino DVD masters and gone back to the old 1"" broadcast masters. This works even better for Jem, because in addition to re-take issues, the Rhino Jem DVDs had horrific color timing, with Pizzazz's hair being a dull pea green instead of the loud neon green seen originally, and on the doll itself. However, three episodes (""The Beginning"", and the first two episodes of Starbright) use versions of the episodes from earlier airings, so there are some extended scenes missing. Most likely, it's because the masters for the final versions of those episodes have the much-reviled ""Jem Girls"" opening instead of the original version of the theme song. Additionally, the opening and end credits for one episode, ""Alone Again"", look terrible, and there is dropout of the picture in one shot during the first song. These issues could have been quickly fixed, and are easily the biggest negative features of the whole set.The sound is a stereoized version of the original mono, which has none of the issues the 5.1 track on the Rhino releases had, such as out-of-sync audio on some songs, and faulty audio at the start of Starbright Part 3. However, as aired on The Hub, certain episodes in the ""Season One"" portion of this set have instrumental openings and/or end credits, and this has been fixed on this set, but rather oddly, as the lyrics are hard to hear, with an echo chamber-like sound to them. Not a deal-breaker to be certain, but still a bit odd.The special features are, to use the obvious pun, outrageous! The making-of documentaries feature a very good assortment of people who worked on the show, and hearty acknowledgments to everyone not present (including, sadly, the cast members who are deceased). There's a good number of commercials, which oddly do not feature the faces of the girls in them blurred out, as was the case with the Transformers and G.I. Joe sets. But the true treasure trove is in the DVD ROM material, which includes the bible, catalogs, and even storyboards. The only possible failing of the special features is that the fan documentary features only one male fan.So, should you buy this set? YES! While the Rhino set had some nice episode commentaries which are sadly not included here, everything else is an upgrade. (Besides, if you're only looking to buy episodes not on the Rhino sets, you'll need two of the three season sets anyways.)",5,"At last, a Sunbow DVD set worth owning!",1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,3087,"['great', 'Marvel/Sunbow', 'cartoon', 'shows', ""'80s"", 'have', 'had', 'rough', 'time', 'DVD', 'Rhino', 'DVDs', 'save', 'couple', 'single-disc', 'releases', 'Transformers', 'Inhumanoids', 'were', 'rife', 'incorrect', 'footage', 'digitally', 'altered', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'censorship', 'one', 'episode', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Jem', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'rate', 'full', 'Rhino', 'lost', 'home', 'video', 'rights', 'Shout', 'factory', 'then', 'promised', 'fix', 'things', 'Transformers', 'still', 'many', 'many', 'errors', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'was', 'unchanged', 'partial', 'Rhino', 'release', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'things', 'wrong', 'episodes', 'new', 'DVD', '.Now', 'have', 'Jem', 'recent', 'reruns', 'Hub', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'completely', 'discarded', 'Rhino', 'DVD', 'masters', 'gone', 'back', 'old', '1', 'broadcast', 'masters', 'even', 'better', 'Jem', 'addition', 're-take', 'issues', 'Rhino', 'Jem', 'DVDs', 'had', 'horrific', 'color', 'timing', 'Pizzazz', 'hair', 'being', 'dull', 'pea', 'green', 'instead', 'loud', 'neon', 'green', 'seen', 'originally', 'doll', 'However', 'three', 'episodes', 'Beginning', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Starbright', 'use', 'versions', 'episodes', 'earlier', 'airings', 'are', 'extended', 'scenes', 'missing', 'Most', 'likely', 'masters', 'final', 'versions', 'episodes', 'have', 'much-reviled', 'Jem', 'Girls', 'opening', 'instead', 'original', 'version', 'theme', 'song', 'Additionally', 'opening', 'end', 'credits', 'one', 'episode', 'Alone', 'Again', 'look', 'terrible', 'dropout', 'picture', 'one', 'shot', 'first', 'song', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quickly', 'fixed', 'are', 'easily', 'biggest', 'negative', 'features', 'whole', 'set.The', 'sound', 'stereoized', 'version', 'original', 'mono', 'none', 'issues', '5.1', 'track', 'Rhino', 'releases', 'had', 'such', 'out-of-sync', 'audio', 'songs', 'faulty', 'audio', 'start', 'Starbright', 'Part', '3', 'However', 'aired', 'Hub', 'certain', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'portion', 'set', 'have', 'instrumental', 'openings', 'and/or', 'end', 'credits', 'been', 'fixed', 'set', 'rather', 'oddly', 'lyrics', 'are', 'hard', 'hear', 'echo', 'chamber-like', 'sound', 'Not', 'deal-breaker', 'be', 'certain', 'still', 'bit', 'odd.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'use', 'obvious', 'pun', 'outrageous', 'making-of', 'documentaries', 'feature', 'very', 'good', 'assortment', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'hearty', 'acknowledgments', 'everyone', 'not', 'present', 'including', 'sadly', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'deceased', 'good', 'number', 'commercials', 'oddly', 'do', 'not', 'feature', 'girls', 'blurred', 'out', 'was', 'case', 'Transformers', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'sets', 'true', 'treasure', 'trove', 'DVD', 'ROM', 'material', 'bible', 'catalogs', 'even', 'storyboards', 'only', 'possible', 'failing', 'special', 'features', 'fan', 'documentary', 'only', 'one', 'male', 'fan.So', 'should', 'buy', 'set', 'YES', 'Rhino', 'set', 'had', 'nice', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'are', 'sadly', 'not', 'included', 'here', 'everything', 'else', 'upgrade', ""'re"", 'only', 'looking', 'buy', 'episodes', 'not', 'Rhino', 'sets', ""'ll"", 'need', 'two', 'three', 'season', 'sets', 'anyways']",Jem and the Holograms: The Truly Outrageous Complete Series

There's also alot of action and adventure to keep guys interested. Plus, its one of the few shows that cover a behind the scenes look at the music business. You get a glimpse into what it would be like to not only be a rock star but also the financial responsibilities of how it all happens. Its basically a cartoon soap opera that was intended for children because it was to promote a toy doll line but it really does a great job of also appealing to adults. There's a love triangle, multiple personalities, car chases, kidnappings, and even serious storylines about teen runaways and teen drug abuse, but they are also told in a careful way that will teach young kids how to handle those tough situations and eventually do the right thing. Even the issue of ""death"" is dealt with as the Jem series begins because the main character Jem/Jerrica is dealing with the loss of her father at a young adult age presumably in her early 20s. There aren't too many cartoon series made for kids these days that teach moral lessons with every episode so Jem is a golden opportunity for you parents out there to have a SAFE program to show your children and not only keep them entertained but also learn a few life lessons as well and to grow up being a good responsible person. And when they do show these moral dilemmas, its not done in a cheesy way or ""in your face"". Anyways, this is a really fun show with great songs that any generation can enjoy. I will add one small note to collectors, don't get rid of your first dvd collection from the 2004 Rhino release. The first five episodes here do not have the extended song mixes nor the extra scenes (e.g. Jerrica talking to the security guard at Starlight Music and running to the elevator in the first episode prior to seeing Eric's new trampy secretary is not on this set).

1452803,AU1ROWBIOKX7X,B005BUA1CG,M. Leister,"[3, 5]","Jem and the Holograms was one of my favorite shows as a kid, I was so happy to be able to buy the whole collection.  I'm not sure why there would be complaints about the color, not only does the DVD color surpass the faded out version being shown on cable, but it also matches what I remember from childhood.  Believe me, when I saw them on cable I knew the color was off.  The color complaint was posted before the DVD set was even shipping so take it with a grain of salt.Season One of Jem was its most complex; lots of two part episodes and intricate stories that carried throughout the year.  It was also the most over the top season.  I found myself wondering how the Misfits had time for their own careers if they wasted so much energy tormenting Jem.  Their actions in this season were truly criminal.  Their manager, Eric Raymond, taught me (as a child) the meaning of the word smarmy with his open shirt, medallion and menacing personality.  In the bonus DVD they explain that Jem was sandwiched between 2 boys' shows so they added lots of action to keep the boys from changing the channel so their sisters had a chance to watch.This was also the season that really dealt with the Jerrica/Rio/Jem triangle.  Rio was attracted to Jem and seemed to know he had to hide it (not so in other seasons) and Jerrica, who knew what her guy was up to, was rightly put out that he was basically cheating.  Rio this season was very angry, pretty much one rant away from being and After School Special, but his anger issues were never explored.  The guy was a crappy boyfriend, I see as an adult, funny how I didn't see it as a kid.  Emotionally cheating, yelling, not a good guy.The Holograms have little to say or do.  Shaina rarely says a word, Aja only has a few more.  Kimber only opens her mouth to say ""outrageous"" and she says EVERY episode.  It gets annoying.If you want to get nitpicky, this season had a lot of animation errors where the wrong outfit would appear for a second.  They also never explain how Emmett Bention, recording mogul, didn't know his daughter could sing that way.  Jem is just a hologram, it's Jerrica doing the singing.  No wonder Starlight Music was always in dire financial straights.Season Two is the one I remember the most, but it was clear the network stuck their noses in.  There were very few two parters, and most episodes were stand-alones, so that anyone could pick up the show and get into it.  Yes it would allow for a wider audience, but it hurt the overall story telling.  The bonus DVD also says that the writers were told to reuse songs this year, which is why they don't fit as nicely into what's going on as they did in season one.  The main title song was changed for almost all the episodes, which is a shame when you hear how much work went into matching the original song to the cartoons' actions in the opening sequence.The Misfits are tamed down a lot, I guess with Jem on its own now, they no longer wanted to attract the boys, or else the network realized the ""bad"" girls were really too bad for little kids.  Eric loses his medallion, gains a tie and collar button.  He is less menacing and employs a tech guy to harass Jem/Jerrica instead of thugs.  He is often the butt of the Misfits' pranks, taking more of the fear element away from him.Also toned down this season is the love triangle.  Rio is barely in the show and Jerrica's jealousy isn't really dealt with.  Interesting is that Rio, who tried to hide his attraction to Jem before, is fine with snuggling with and kissing her in front of Jerrica's friends and her SISTER.  I know the Holograms know the truth, but why would Rio do that in front of them and isn't he wondering why Kimber hasn't decked him?The Holograms step out of the shadows more this year.  Aja doesn't have much to do and newbie Raya really is just along for the ride, but Shaina and Kimber have more stories.  The New Orleans one about Shaina was always a favorite of mine.  Kimber on the other hand...she makes you long for the days when all she said was ""outrageous"".  They chose to show she was Jerrica's slightly younger sister by having her cry, shout and storm around like a hormonal teenager.  Then backed it up by creating Jerrica's third personality, one I call Jerk-ica, who is a 50 year old stereotypical parent (do as I say, I know best, you're too young) who looks like a 20-something.  I actually hated Jerrica in those scenes, even though Kimber was being a brat.However, Kimber also embarked on a story I still love.  She had a love triangle with actor/singer Sean and stunt man Jeff.  I remember being on the edge of my seat wondering who she would pick.  I also remember loving her wedding gown, and when I saw it again as an adult I still loved it.  I didn't realize how short this story was, I remembered it lasting for more than one episode, but the choice and the wedding are all in one 30 minute story.The most powerful story this season was that of the Benton sister's mother, Jaqui Benton, life and death.  It was a very sad, moving story to tell in a children's cartoon.  It's probably also why I always think the plane I'm on is going to crash.  I suspect Jaqui's singing voice is provided by the woman who does Jem's speaking voice, as she is a singer.  Listen closely and see what you think.The flubs this season:  Kimber tells Sean he's holding up her sister's movie career.  Jem isn't Kimber's sister, Jerrica is.  It's Jem in the movie with Sean, he should have been questioning that.  Also, when Kimber and Stormer sing together, you can't tell their voices apart (I think they used the same vocalist) and the singing voices really don't fit with their speaking voices, which is disappointing since Jem and Pizazz really match theirs.Season Three, the final year.  With sales of Jem dolls not able to beat Barbie, this season came to a screeching halt halfway through.  It got more of an ending than most non-cartoon shows do, but a lot was left hanging.  But let's start at the beginning...This season they introduced new musical group The Stingers.  Watching their theme song be performed, I laughed at how ridiculous it was.  From the lyrics to the little finger points Riot was doing, it was just bad.  I remember thinking Riot was great as a kid, but as an adult I find him unpalatably arrogant.  And, children watching these for the first time who don't know what 80s hair bands wore, are going to wonder why Riot is battling Rio for Jem and not the other way around.It is clear from the new tags for commercial breaks that this season was supposed to be about Rio/Jem/Riot.  The writers finally figured out that even little girls didn't want to think about their guy leaving them for a more glamorous woman while her friends and sister stood around saying nothing.  Yes, Jerrica's jealousy did crop up again this year, but Riot spent a lot of time chasing Jem and it was refreshing.Also fun was seeing Pizazz really fall for someone and make an idiot of herself trying to get his love.  But that was really all the Misfits had to do this season, most of the non-Jem parts went to the Stingers, who we never had time to really get to know.  Why were Minx and Rapture so mean?  And why did Minx's accent vary from British, to Slavic to What-in-the-hell?I no sooner got into the season and it was over.  The end comes rather abruptly in the episode A Father Should Be.  Banee's quest to find her father (a story I was stunned only spanned 3 episodes, I remember it being a huge story in the series) comes to a happy close with her finding him.  At her going away party, the Stingers are there because Riot's connections helped find him and the Misfits inexplicably show up to ask for a truce.  Of course Jem says yes.  All three bands break into a farewell song and the last image is of Jem at the door of Starlight house waving good-bye to Banee and her fans.Even as a kid I knew that was the end without being told it was cancelled.  But you never see Rio learn the truth or find out what happens with Riot's pursuit of Jem.Bonus materials:The commercials aren't really much to watch.  There's a reason fast forward was invented.The fan interviews I expected to be with famous people who were inspired by Jem, or regular people showing massive doll collections, but they are just a bunch of unknowns not saying much of anything.The cast/crew interviews are a bit more interesting, but I was hoping for some big insight of where season 3 would have gone and it's not there.  It's funny how the actress who did the speaking voice of Jem/Jerrica starts out sounding not much like her, occasionally lapses into a British accent, but by the end is in full Jem mode.  Talk about show boating.I can't get the special features for the computer to play on mine, so I can't comment on them.All in all, this set is well worth buying if you loved Jem as a kid.",5,Jem is

1452809,A20X74FQDOPRYM,B005BUA1CG,Shurron Farmer,"[8, 9]","Like others who've reviewed this wonderful 1980's cartoon, and perhaps as one of the few Black men who admits to love this series, I'm truly grateful to Shout! Factory for releasing this series in its entirety. I applaud the cast and crew for making Jem and the Holograms withstand time with its messages that speak (without overkill) about the beauty of the human spirit. I especially appreciate the special features included in this release.There are some critiques I make about the release:1. Video Quality: The Rhino release preserved the original broadcast quality of the series. However, the Shout! release seems to be darker and of lower quality. I don't know if this is perhaps the Masters degenerated during the change in license from Rhino to Shout! Factory. Nevertheless, I wish more of the episodes were restored to their original quality.2. When I watched the first episode of the series, I noticed that the first act was edited. Again, I wonder if this has anything to do with the change in the distribution license. I didn't check the other episodes on the Shout! Factory release, but I hope they haven't been cut.Apart from the above critiques, I'm ecstatic to see the release of the complete Jem and the Holograms Series. As the cartoon currently airs on the HUB network with increasing popularity, I hope more of today's children (regardless of gender) will takes the lessons of the show and apply them to their lives. Many 1980's animated series had this in common and I believe it helped many of us 80's kids becomes the great adults of today.",4,Glad for the release,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,1563,"['others', 'who', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'wonderful', '1980', 'cartoon', 'perhaps', 'one', 'few', 'Black', 'men', 'who', 'love', 'series', ""'m"", 'truly', 'grateful', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'releasing', 'series', 'entirety', 'applaud', 'cast', 'crew', 'making', 'Jem', 'Holograms', 'withstand', 'time', 'messages', 'speak', 'overkill', 'beauty', 'human', 'spirit', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'critiques', 'make', 'release:1', 'Video', 'Quality', 'Rhino', 'release', 'preserved', 'original', 'broadcast', 'quality', 'series', 'However', 'Shout', 'release', 'be', 'darker', 'lower', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'perhaps', 'Masters', 'degenerated', 'change', 'license', 'Rhino', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'Nevertheless', 'wish', 'more', 'episodes', 'were', 'restored', 'original', 'quality.2', 'When', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'noticed', 'first', 'act', 'was', 'edited', 'Again', 'wonder', 'anything', 'do', 'change', 'distribution', 'license', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'other', 'episodes', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'release', 'hope', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'cut.Apart', 'above', 'critiques', ""'m"", 'ecstatic', 'see', 'release', 'complete', 'Jem', 'Holograms', 'Series', 'cartoon', 'currently', 'HUB', 'network', 'increasing', 'popularity', 'hope', 'more', 'today', 'children', 'regardless', 'gender', 'will', 'lessons', 'show', 'apply', 'lives', 'Many', '1980', 'animated', 'series', 'had', 'common', 'believe', 'helped', 'many', '80', 'kids', 'great', 'adults', 'today']",Jem and the Holograms: The Truly Outrageous Complete Series

Oh The 1980's - I love it deeply; with Beverly Hills Teens and Maxie's World; this is one of the shows my sister would sit me on her lap and watch her own self as a big kid. I &#34;secretly borrowed&#34; her VHS tapes and never returned them. I had a few episodes like &#34;The Jem Jam&#34;  and &#34;Hot Time In Hawaii&#34; So it was pretty awesome to have the whole series on DVD.

JEM is just about everything I remember the 80s to be ; loud, flashy, and colorful. The storylines can get quite intense, especially for 80s cartoons. But it's a lot of fun. Cheesy 80s fun, which is right up my alley. The story has been recounted a million times in other reviews, so I won't talk about that here. I'll just stick to the dvd quality. The picture is especially good for an 80s cartoon, though a bit fuzzy at times. The masters used for the episodes are the broadcast masters. The colours may be a bit more muted than some people have seen, but the brighter, sharper versions were unfinished masters used by the previous company, Rhino. These are by far the better copies as they are what was shown on tv. The audio is pretty good for the age of the show, though a few episodes have a strange echo on the opening credits and the ""be right back"" interstitals.
