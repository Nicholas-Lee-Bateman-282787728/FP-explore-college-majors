1521432,A1OOR0WBZ4F9WF,B006WNSHZO,Anime's Platonic Lover,"[29, 32]","I remember this show from when I was an early teen. I was always a fan of the character of Sherlock Holmes but could never get into Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books at that age. Then this cartoon came along. Being a scifi geek I gravitated towards it. It continues where the books ended with Holmes and Moriarty dying together over a waterfall but instead Holmes managed to save himself. He continued his career in secret until he died at a ripe old age. His remains, which were perserved in honey, are reanimated in the future when it turns out 22nd century criminals have cloned Moriarty. Inspector Lestrad is replaced by his great great great granddaughter and lovable Dr. Watson is replaced by an android with his complete works and journals downloaded in it's harddrive. The three then track Moriarty and solve various cases modeled after each original Holmes story... Hounds of Baskervilles, The Red Headed League, etc. with a futuristic twist. Great for kids who love scifi and want to try a little classic literature too and great for adults because it's still quite intelligent and very entertaining. My only complaint about this wonderful show is it didn't last longer. Enjoy.Funny Fact: Doyle never intended to write the last Sherlock Holmes book. He wanted to leave the characters of Holmes and Moriarty in an eternal chase..one never catching the other as a metaphor for the never ending struggle of good and evil. But his publishers and fans badgered him relentlessly for years to at least finish off the series with some sort of closure. So he did. He killed them both off out of pure spite.

Still, it is a lot of fun and I think well worth the price for 26 episodes.

Re-tellings are apart of all things (books, art, music, movies, tv programs) and sometimes they aren't fantastic. Not to say that this is terrible, but it wasn't my cup of tea. The accents that were giving to these characters were meant to sound British (different dialects also used) and they sounded rough and forced in some places. The character of Holmes himself IS egotistical, but sometimes he didn't feel like the character in this watered down version of himself. His over explaining EVERYTHING to the people around him as well as the enemy weren't fun and sometimes long to sit through. Though the actual Sherlock Holmes character does explain things, it is usually towards the end of the adventure when things are wrapping up and doesn't feel like it drags on. And the CONSTANT usage of &#34;It's Elementary&#34; followed by the lengthy explanations was rather off putting.Now please keep in mind, I did like the series over all.

1521466,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B006WNSHZO,trebe,"[0, 0]","Generally regarded as the world's most well-known literary sleuth, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes has been featured in films and on television many times.  In recent years, the character has been modernized in the British TV seriesSherlock, the 2012 CBS's series Elementary, and the feature films featuring Robert Downey Jr.  However the most advanced update of the character might be the animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century (1999), which was produced by Scottish Television Enterprises.The premise is that far in the future, Holmes is brought out of suspended animation, to resume his crime fighting career, assisting Inspector Beth Lestrade of New Scotland Yard.  Holmes is partnered with a police robot named ""Watson"", whose appearance is changed to resemble Holmes' old friend Dr. John Watson.  A total of 26 episodes were produced, each very loosely based on one of Conan Doyle's stories.  A descendant of Holmes' arch enemy Professor Moriarty, is featured as an ongoing adversary.This program involves a pretty major makeover for the character, as targeted at a younger audience, Holmes is young, physically active, and doesn't investigate murder cases, play the violin, or use any illegal substances.  This Holmes is still quite confident and outspoken, and in accord with his motto ""eyes and brains"", relies heavily on observation, inference, and deduction, to solve his cases.  While he may not be completely at home with all the technical advances in the future, he is a fast learner, and adapts nicely to modern developments.  Another major factor, is the prominence of Beth Lestrade, who as a friendly rival of Holmes, is often is almost as important as the great detective.  Besides having Dr. Watson as a partner, Holmes sometimes works with some young junior detectives.These ""modernized"" animated adventures are obviously a light years from Conan Doyle's original stories, but may be of some interest, in these times when there seems to be a renewed interest in Sherlock Holmes.  It is quite possible however, that some Holmes purists may find little to like about this series.The animation is good, and minus most of the darker elements associated with Sherlock Holmes, the stories are mostly suitable for teens.  Definitely an acquired taste, Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century comes in a standard sized DVD case which houses three single sided DVD's in paper sleeves.
