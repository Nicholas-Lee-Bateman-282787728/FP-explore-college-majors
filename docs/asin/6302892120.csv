344399,A6IKQOVUT6AI4,6302892120,Bonita L. Davis,"[6, 6]","Elnora is a vivacious, bright and sensitive young girl who has a dream of attending high school. Isolated on the family farm with her mother, she is berated for her dreams. Elnora doesn't give in but challenges her mother in fulfilling her own dreams.Thus begins the clash of generations. An embittered woman whose own dreams were dashed attempts to discourage her own child. A young teenager is coming to terms with herself, her talents and her mother's disdain. You have a remarkable story of how these two  clash and attempt to come to some type of resolution that will be best for all in the early years of the 20th Century.A Girl of the Limberlost tells the story about a dreamer who has so much potential if only she is allowed to blossom. It is also the story of a young woman whose dreams were unrealized and her hope destroyed. Her experiences led her into the spirit of cynicism to the point of being afraid to let go. The dynamics of these relationships mirror our own as we are hesitant in letting our children go due to our own experiences.You will be enthralled by Elnora's free spirit and encouraged by her resolve not to give up. Limberlost, the swamp on the border of their farm provides you with the backdrop of the beauty of nature and its destruction by man as he progresses. Limberlost is a place of loss and renewal for Enora and her stubborn mother Kate.I enjoyed this movie because it unfolded the joy of discovery, openess and rebellion that all young people must go through when they are stifled by narrow minded parents. It sensitizes us to the fact that our children must be allowed to dream if they are ever to grow into secure adults. For a dream to unfold, it must be nurtured.",4,FOR A DREAM TO UNFOLD,978134400,"12 30, 2000",2000,1708,"['Elnora', 'vivacious', 'bright', 'sensitive', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'dream', 'attending', 'high', 'school', 'Isolated', 'family', 'farm', 'mother', 'berated', 'dreams', 'Elnora', ""n't"", 'give', 'mother', 'fulfilling', 'own', 'dreams.Thus', 'clash', 'generations', 'embittered', 'woman', 'own', 'dreams', 'were', 'dashed', 'attempts', 'discourage', 'own', 'child', 'young', 'teenager', 'coming', 'terms', 'herself', 'talents', 'mother', 'disdain', 'have', 'remarkable', 'story', 'how', 'two', 'clash', 'attempt', 'come', 'type', 'resolution', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'early', 'years', '20th', 'Century.A', 'Girl', 'Limberlost', 'story', 'dreamer', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'only', 'allowed', 'blossom', 'also', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'dreams', 'were', 'unrealized', 'hope', 'destroyed', 'experiences', 'led', 'spirit', 'cynicism', 'point', 'being', 'afraid', 'let', 'go', 'dynamics', 'relationships', 'mirror', 'own', 'are', 'hesitant', 'letting', 'children', 'go', 'due', 'own', 'experiences.You', 'will', 'be', 'enthralled', 'Elnora', 'free', 'spirit', 'encouraged', 'resolve', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'Limberlost', 'swamp', 'border', 'farm', 'backdrop', 'beauty', 'nature', 'destruction', 'man', 'Limberlost', 'place', 'loss', 'renewal', 'Enora', 'stubborn', 'mother', 'Kate.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'unfolded', 'joy', 'discovery', 'openess', 'rebellion', 'young', 'people', 'must', 'go', 'when', 'are', 'stifled', 'narrow', 'minded', 'parents', 'fact', 'children', 'must', 'be', 'allowed', 'dream', 'are', 'ever', 'grow', 'secure', 'adults', 'dream', 'unfold', 'must', 'be', 'nurtured']",N/A

344406,A1JEFESGLIS076,6302892120,rsoonsa,"[28, 29]","The fourth essay at converting Geneva (Gene) Stratton-Porter's most popular novel for the screen, this version conflicts markedly with the original story while yet managing to make a faithful adaptation of the book's pre-Great War era in a visually appealing film, with beautiful southern Oregon locations standing in for the author's eastern Indiana setting.  Stratton-Porter is inserted into the scenario as the ""Bird-Woman"" of the Limberlost Swamp region, here played sensitively by Joanna Cassidy, and the naturalist writer's endeavours with camera, notebooks, and glass photographic plates is accurately rendered, even to a mention of her watercolour tinting for illustrations in a published volume of nature studies, but there are significant alterations in the characters of Elnora Comstock (Heather Fairchild) and her embittered widowed mother Kate (Annette O'Toole) that result in flaws of logic surrounding their actions.  Since this product comes from Feature Films For Families, it was possibly deemed discreet to eliminate the important reference to Elnora's father's marital infidelity, but nothing is provided here to replace it in context, while the omission of the neighbouring childless couple, the Sintons, with their supportive counsel of Elnora; and of Phillip, beau of the young farm girl, are unfilled voids.  The dramatic act of Kate that results in a climactic clash between mother and daughter is weakly altered and Fairchild's sporadic Valley Girl diction and mannerisms are not harmonious with O'Toole's more accurate dialect, especially since the two have lived only with each other since the girl's birth 16 years prior, but Fairchild nicely interprets Elnora's struggle to balance her desire for self-improvement with her loyalty to her mother and to their tax-endangered farm.  Direction is pedestrian, and a minimalist score is nonspecific, but the sets and costumes are splendidly crafted.",3,DRIFTS AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL AT CRUCIAL POINTS.,1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,1923,"['fourth', 'essay', 'converting', 'Geneva', 'Gene', 'Stratton-Porter', 'most', 'popular', 'novel', 'screen', 'version', 'markedly', 'original', 'story', 'yet', 'managing', 'make', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'pre-Great', 'War', 'era', 'visually', 'appealing', 'film', 'beautiful', 'southern', 'Oregon', 'locations', 'standing', 'author', 'eastern', 'Indiana', 'setting', 'Stratton-Porter', 'inserted', 'scenario', 'Bird-Woman', 'Limberlost', 'Swamp', 'region', 'here', 'played', 'sensitively', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'naturalist', 'writer', 'endeavours', 'camera', 'notebooks', 'glass', 'photographic', 'plates', 'accurately', 'rendered', 'even', 'mention', 'watercolour', 'tinting', 'illustrations', 'published', 'volume', 'nature', 'studies', 'are', 'significant', 'alterations', 'characters', 'Elnora', 'Comstock', 'Heather', 'Fairchild', 'embittered', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Kate', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'result', 'flaws', 'logic', 'surrounding', 'actions', 'product', 'Feature', 'Films', 'Families', 'was', 'possibly', 'deemed', 'discreet', 'eliminate', 'important', 'reference', 'Elnora', 'father', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'nothing', 'provided', 'here', 'replace', 'context', 'omission', 'neighbouring', 'childless', 'couple', 'Sintons', 'supportive', 'counsel', 'Elnora', 'Phillip', 'beau', 'young', 'farm', 'girl', 'are', 'unfilled', 'voids', 'dramatic', 'act', 'Kate', 'results', 'climactic', 'clash', 'mother', 'daughter', 'weakly', 'altered', 'Fairchild', 'sporadic', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'diction', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'not', 'harmonious', ""O'Toole"", 'more', 'accurate', 'dialect', 'especially', 'two', 'have', 'lived', 'only', 'other', 'girl', 'birth', '16', 'years', 'prior', 'Fairchild', 'nicely', 'Elnora', 'struggle', 'balance', 'desire', 'self-improvement', 'loyalty', 'mother', 'tax-endangered', 'farm', 'Direction', 'pedestrian', 'minimalist', 'score', 'nonspecific', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'splendidly', 'crafted']",N/A
