A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Mix together random ingredients of Anne Rice and Anita Blake, add a dollop of wretched writing, and finish with a vacuous, passive heroine who serves as the fans' stand-in.This is the winning formula for the ""The Twilight Saga (Twilight / New Moon / Eclipse),"" a ridiculously overhyped series chronicling the overwrought romance of a century-old vampire and a completely ordinary teen girl. It's the stuff of a thousand teenage girls' fan-fiction fantasies, complete with wretchedly wooden acting and all the excitement of a wet squib.""Twilight"" introduces us to Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a stone-faced plain-Jane who moves to the rainy town of Forks. But then she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who is hot, rich, and plays the ""stay away from me because I'm dangerous"" seduction card. Eventually Bella figures out the bleeding obvious: Edward is a vampire with sparkly skin and a ""vegetarian"" diet.But their budding relationship is thrown into turmoil when an evil vampire decides to hunt Bella, and draws her into a dangerous trap. Then things get even worse in ""New Moon"" when Edward and his family depart Forks, and Bella starts doing dangerous sports that allow her to hear Edward's voice, when she isn't hanging out with hunky werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). But a mistaken vision leads Edward to believe Bella is dead -- and soon HE might be if Bella doesn't stop him.Of course, in ""Eclipse"" the werewolf and vampire vie for Bella's attentions, apparently because she's just SO desirable that no one could live without her. Even as an old enemy attacks the vampires of Forks with an army of vampire newborns, and the vampires and werewolves must band together to protect one utterly useless human girl... we still have time for relationship issues!The ""Twilight"" series is a perfect example of a plotless, drippy teen romance that likes to think it's actually an epic story (hence the ""saga"" description). Pretty much everything in the story revolves around a contrived love triangle that is never really believable to begin with -- especially since it demands that we believe that all teenage boys are attracted to Bella Swan.Admittedly it does insert some awesome vampire action scenes that were never in Stephenie Meyer's tiresome books, such as the butt-kicking finale of ""Eclipse."" But this can't disguise the fact that the entire story revolves around tiresome angst -- everyone mopes, whines, moans, and occasionally gets suicidal. And the dialogue is so ridiculously overwrought that it becomes uproariously funny. Consider: ""This is the skin of a killer, Bella!"", which is such an absurd line that you can almost see Pattinson cracking up.Kristen Stewart is perfectly cast as Bella Swan -- which is to say that the character is bland, inexpressive, pretentious and a mass of irritating tics like pawing at her hair and sighing through her front teeth. It's hard to see why she's supposed to be so irresistible, except that her plain nondescript appearance allows teen girls to imagine themselves in her place as a more attractive, dynamic actress could not have.Robert Pattinson and a mass of gelled hair give little energy to his performance as the bipolar, controlling Edward Cullen, and he always looks like he's counting the seconds until he can escape the franchise. And Lautner, bless him, is trying his hardest to make the most likable (read: least stalkerish) of the three characters come to life, but his mediocre performance is smothered under the movie's thick blanket of awkward romance.""The Twilight Saga (Twilight / New Moon / Eclipse)"" is best appreciated with large quantities of alcohol and a bunch of like-minded friends, so you can riff the pretentious romanticism for hours on end. Otherwise, avoid like the sparkly plague.",1,SPARKLE!,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,3773,"['Mix', 'together', 'random', 'ingredients', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Anita', 'Blake', 'add', 'dollop', 'wretched', 'writing', 'finish', 'vacuous', 'passive', 'heroine', 'who', 'fans', 'stand-in.This', 'winning', 'formula', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Twilight', '/', 'New', 'Moon', '/', 'Eclipse', 'ridiculously', 'overhyped', 'series', 'chronicling', 'overwrought', 'romance', 'century-old', 'vampire', 'completely', 'ordinary', 'teen', 'girl', 'stuff', 'thousand', 'teenage', 'girls', 'fan-fiction', 'fantasies', 'complete', 'wretchedly', 'wooden', 'acting', 'excitement', 'wet', 'squib', 'Twilight', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'stone-faced', 'plain-Jane', 'who', 'rainy', 'town', 'Forks', 'then', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'who', 'hot', 'rich', 'stay', 'away', ""'m"", 'dangerous', 'seduction', 'card', 'Eventually', 'Bella', 'out', 'bleeding', 'obvious', 'Edward', 'vampire', 'sparkly', 'skin', 'vegetarian', 'diet.But', 'budding', 'relationship', 'thrown', 'turmoil', 'when', 'evil', 'vampire', 'decides', 'hunt', 'Bella', 'dangerous', 'trap', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'New', 'Moon', 'when', 'Edward', 'family', 'depart', 'Forks', 'Bella', 'doing', 'dangerous', 'sports', 'allow', 'hear', 'Edward', 'voice', 'when', ""n't"", 'hanging', 'out', 'hunky', 'werewolf', 'Jacob', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'mistaken', 'vision', 'Edward', 'believe', 'Bella', 'dead', 'soon', 'HE', 'might', 'be', 'Bella', ""n't"", 'stop', 'him.Of', 'course', 'Eclipse', 'werewolf', 'vampire', 'vie', 'Bella', 'attentions', 'apparently', 'just', 'SO', 'desirable', 'one', 'could', 'live', 'Even', 'old', 'enemy', 'vampires', 'Forks', 'army', 'vampire', 'newborns', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'must', 'band', 'together', 'protect', 'one', 'utterly', 'useless', 'human', 'girl', 'still', 'have', 'time', 'relationship', 'issues', 'Twilight', 'series', 'perfect', 'example', 'plotless', 'drippy', 'teen', 'romance', 'think', 'actually', 'epic', 'story', 'hence', 'saga', 'description', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'story', 'around', 'contrived', 'love', 'triangle', 'never', 'really', 'believable', 'begin', 'especially', 'believe', 'teenage', 'boys', 'are', 'attracted', 'Bella', 'Swan.Admittedly', 'insert', 'awesome', 'vampire', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'never', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'tiresome', 'books', 'such', 'butt-kicking', 'finale', 'Eclipse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disguise', 'fact', 'entire', 'story', 'revolves', 'tiresome', 'angst', 'everyone', 'mopes', 'whines', 'moans', 'occasionally', 'suicidal', 'dialogue', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'overwrought', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'Consider', 'skin', 'killer', 'Bella', 'such', 'absurd', 'line', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'Pattinson', 'cracking', 'up.Kristen', 'Stewart', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'say', 'character', 'bland', 'inexpressive', 'pretentious', 'mass', 'irritating', 'tics', 'pawing', 'hair', 'sighing', 'front', 'teeth', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'irresistible', 'plain', 'nondescript', 'appearance', 'teen', 'girls', 'imagine', 'place', 'more', 'attractive', 'dynamic', 'actress', 'could', 'not', 'have.Robert', 'Pattinson', 'mass', 'gelled', 'hair', 'give', 'little', 'energy', 'performance', 'bipolar', 'controlling', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'always', 'counting', 'seconds', 'can', 'escape', 'franchise', 'Lautner', 'bless', 'trying', 'hardest', 'make', 'most', 'likable', 'read', 'least', 'stalkerish', 'three', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'smothered', 'movie', 'thick', 'blanket', 'awkward', 'romance', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Twilight', '/', 'New', 'Moon', '/', 'Eclipse', 'best', 'appreciated', 'large', 'quantities', 'alcohol', 'bunch', 'like-minded', 'friends', 'can', 'riff', 'pretentious', 'romanticism', 'hours', 'end', 'Otherwise', 'avoid', 'sparkly', 'plague']",N/A

Anyone that gives the move a bad review should not have bought them in the first place. I did see all three movies before I bought them so it wasn't new to me but I liked the movies a lot in the theater and have the Blue Ray version for my home. I am going to see the fourth movie tomorrow. I saw the first three with my granddaughter. She read the books and kind of knew what was going to happen. The third was the best. A lot of action, explanations about the characters and how they got to be what they are. The third one has special effects that were very good. The werewolves were amazing. My granddaughter doesn't want to see the next one though. She said the book wasn't that good, but I think she is nervous about the scenes when Bella has her baby. I am going alone to see this and I will tell her if it may be something she wants to see. She is 14 and very shy. Anyway, I noticed the first one is on TV a lot so if anyone wants to see the first ones before they buy them it won't be a problem. Can always rent them too. Wish I wasn't going alone but no one around here want to see it. Never went to the show alone before but I gotta do what I'm going to do.
