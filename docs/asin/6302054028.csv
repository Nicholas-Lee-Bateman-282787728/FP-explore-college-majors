Although this movie tries to ride on the shirt tails of that success, it is actually a very well made, and self standing production. Paul began his career many years earlier on Australian TV in his own show which was a series of sketches, observations, and almost a down under version of a one man Saturday night live. Anyone familiar with this early material will enjoy the mix of subtle antipodean humor, and at times slapstick sight gags in this picture. But this is NO Dundee style flick, despite the repeated pairing of Hogan and Kozlowski (as the love interest)and is a light, poignant and thought provoking storyline. Another great strength is the moral comment that is discreetly delivered, without being overly sentimental, or patronising. Hogan plays a reformed petty thief who is convinced he has died and been delivered back to Earth to make amends for his wayward lifestyle. This knowledge makes him conduct himself as if indestructible, with some funny results, and the whole picture has a feelgood flavour, whilst cleverly retaining a sober undertone. This apsect of the picture is never really revealed to the audience, and the ""is he, isn't he""? aspect adss an extra dimension to the comedy. An excellent cameo from Charlton Heston as God, and a solid supporting cast and script, leaves one wondering why this film was only moderately succesful at the box office, and more importantly why it has yet to make it to DVD. With the amount of relaunching, repackaging, special editions, and anniversary releases of a ton of movies these days, this film doesn't deserve to be overlooked. A contemporary ""It's a Wonderful Life"" it may not quite be, but it IS a very good movie.

Bernabo,"[19, 20]","In 1986 Paul Hogan moved from being the spokesman for Australian tourism on the small screen to the surprise star of the surprise hit theatrical film, &quot;Crocodile Dundee.&quot;  Two years later he made &quot;Crocodile Dundee II,&quot; and two years after that he made this comedy and married his constant co-star Linda Kozlowski.  &quot;Almost an Angel&quot; is a better film than &quot;Crocodile Dundee II,&quot; and certainly the most intimate of Hogan's first three films.This time around he plays Terry Dean, an expert on security systems who was so good his criminal endeavors were easily recognizable who also took a turn at some creative attempts at bank robbery.  The real story begins when Terry gets out of prison and becomes convinced that he has not only died but has been sent back to Earth by a heavenly being (who sure sounds and looks like Charlton Heston) with a chance to redeem himself.  Since Hogan clearly believes this is what is going along, there is no reason for us not to go along for the ride.Terry meets up with Steve (Elias Koteas), a guy in a wheelchair and the next thing we know he is being taken home, meeting Steve's sister Rose (Kozlowski), and helping out at the center for the neighborhood kids.  The formula is fairly obvious, but the point is not whether Terry is going to find his redemption but how he is going to pull it off.  Ultimately the film's message (yes, there actually is one) is relatively simple: Terry succeeds because he has complete faith in himself.  It does not matter that his faith is without a true foundation, because Terry is too busy moving mountains to notice his grand delusion is built on shifting sand.Once again, Hogan's performance redeems a lot of the faults with the movie in which he is appearing.  Since Hogan writes his own scripts he has the advantage of knowing exactly what works for his screen persona.  Terry Dean is not as whimsical as Mick Dundee, but Hogan was clearly smart enough to try and get beyond that character.  He was also smart to make a more intimate sort of movie, where the situation is what is out there more than the character.  Hogan also knows how to set up his gags pretty well.  &quot;Almost an Angel&quot; only made a fraction of the money by either of the &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; films, but it is arguably a better made movie.",4,Paul Hogan tries to play someone other than Mick Dundee,1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,2340,"['1986', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'moved', 'being', 'spokesman', 'Australian', 'tourism', 'small', 'screen', 'surprise', 'star', 'surprise', 'hit', 'theatrical', 'film', 'quot', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee.', 'quot', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'made', 'quot', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'II', 'quot', 'two', 'years', 'made', 'comedy', 'married', 'constant', 'co-star', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'quot', 'Almost', 'Angel', 'quot', 'better', 'film', 'quot', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'II', 'quot', 'certainly', 'most', 'intimate', 'Hogan', 'first', 'three', 'films.This', 'time', 'Terry', 'Dean', 'expert', 'security', 'systems', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'criminal', 'endeavors', 'were', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'who', 'also', 'took', 'turn', 'creative', 'attempts', 'bank', 'robbery', 'real', 'story', 'when', 'Terry', 'prison', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'not', 'only', 'died', 'been', 'sent', 'back', 'Earth', 'heavenly', 'being', 'who', 'sure', 'sounds', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'chance', 'redeem', 'Hogan', 'clearly', 'what', 'going', 'along', 'reason', 'not', 'go', 'along', 'ride.Terry', 'up', 'Steve', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'guy', 'wheelchair', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'being', 'taken', 'home', 'meeting', 'Steve', 'sister', 'Rose', 'Kozlowski', 'helping', 'out', 'center', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'formula', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'point', 'not', 'Terry', 'going', 'find', 'redemption', 'how', 'going', 'pull', 'off', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'message', 'yes', 'actually', 'one', 'relatively', 'simple', 'Terry', 'complete', 'faith', 'not', 'matter', 'faith', 'true', 'foundation', 'Terry', 'too', 'busy', 'moving', 'mountains', 'notice', 'grand', 'delusion', 'built', 'shifting', 'sand.Once', 'again', 'Hogan', 'performance', 'lot', 'faults', 'movie', 'appearing', 'Hogan', 'own', 'scripts', 'advantage', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', 'screen', 'persona', 'Terry', 'Dean', 'not', 'as', 'whimsical', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'Hogan', 'was', 'clearly', 'smart', 'enough', 'try', 'get', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'smart', 'make', 'more', 'intimate', 'sort', 'movie', 'where', 'situation', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'more', 'character', 'Hogan', 'also', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'gags', 'pretty', 'well', 'quot', 'Almost', 'Angel', 'quot', 'only', 'made', 'fraction', 'money', 'quot', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'quot', 'films', 'arguably', 'better', 'made', 'movie']",N/A

There are some scenes in here that had me spraying water out of my nose (i.e. caught me off guard while drinking). It's a low-key movie, not a lot of action. Mostly a drama it succeeds in throwing humor your way when it can. Some of the jokes are very bad, to the point of cringing as you shake your head. But overall it is a fun movie to watch.If you like Paul Hogan then it is a safe bet you'll enjoy this movie. Otherwise, you may be better off renting it first to see if it worth keeping in your collection.

Comedy mixed with other feelings thrown in that it makes this show a classic. Sadness and comedy combined sounds odd, but this movie is not for all as it looks like. It makes you wonder about things around you and your own feelings. Something that is a must see to appreciate and fully understand. Different to all others that it belongs in my library so I can sit and watch when ever.  About a man trying to become an angel for his past doings. I rated this an A grade plus for the unusual storyline that the cast did so well convincing you its true.

It seemed a long time before it was available on DVD in a widescreen format, and I couldn't wait to get it! Why?, because of the story!Paul Hogan (Crocodile Dundee) plays a career criminal named Terry Dean, who has just been released from prison in the first few moments of the picture. We learn he is an electronics genious, and plans to return to his life of crime. Without thinking about it, he is hit by a car, while saving a little girl, knocking him out. When he reawakes, he appears to be in Heaven with God, who looks strangely like Charlton Heston. A conversation takes place, and when he emerges from this vision, he believes he's an angel, a life altering experience with lots of humour, never a dull moment!!A very uplifting picture, well done, co-starring Elias Koteas, and Linda Kozlowski.",4,"My Take On ""Almost An Angel"".",1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,862,"['first', 'saw', 'Almost', 'Angel', 'VHS', 'fullscreen', 'format', 'seemed', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'format', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'Why', 'story', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'career', 'criminal', 'named', 'Terry', 'Dean', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'picture', 'learn', 'electronics', 'genious', 'plans', 'return', 'life', 'crime', 'thinking', 'hit', 'car', 'saving', 'little', 'girl', 'knocking', 'out', 'When', 'be', 'Heaven', 'God', 'who', 'strangely', 'like', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'conversation', 'place', 'when', 'vision', 'angel', 'life', 'altering', 'experience', 'lots', 'humour', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'very', 'uplifting', 'picture', 'well', 'done', 'co-starring', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski']",N/A
