Fultz,"[3, 6]","It would be nice to be able to tell people that ""The Bachelor"" is a funny, interesting story about a man facing the inevitable commitment of marriage with fear and trepidation.  It would be nice, but it won't happen, because  while this movie starts with a good premise and then gives the viewer a  strong half-hour of entertainment, it ends up being a tedious film with too  many cliches, weak characters and an all to predictable ending.The  story of Jimmie (the usually good Chris O'Donnell), who finds himself  moving closer and closer to losing his prized bachelorhood as one by one  his friends get married off.  Jimmie finally decides it is time to propose  to his long-time girlfriend (the beautiful, talented Renee Zellweger)  despite the fact that he is not ready to settle down.  Predictably, his  proposal goes badly and he is forced to deal with the consequences of his  actions.  The immediate aftermath of the proposal is very funny, and if the  movie had stuck to following these two characters attempts at repairing  their romance, this could have been a very good movie.  Instead, the movie  slants off in a ""Brewster's Million""-type storyline involving an  inheritance that can only be earned with a marriage and children.  Jimmie's  search for a bride is not interesting, not funny and the end is way too  predictable.It is especially unfortunate that the makers of this film  chose to take the movie where they did, because it wastes a very good cast  and fails to take advantage of a nice chemistry that O'Donnell and  Zellweger showed early in the film.  Zellweger's performance is as good as  any she has given and O'Donnell does as much as he can with his poorly  written character.  With Ed Asner, Hal Holbrook, James Cromwell (who's  scene with O'Donnell in a boat is the only good part of the last two-thirds  of this film) and Shani Engum, the supporting cast is filled with capable  actors who are given nothing to work with.  It would have been nice to see  this cast put together in a good film.Overall, despite the good start  and fine cast, this movie does not provide good entertainment.

The worst thing about it is that its view of male-female relationships is so backward - especially in a movie set in modern-day San Francisco!.

And the scene where O'Donnell fumbles his marriage proposal to Zellweger - in many ways the central scene of the movie - is pretty funny.

I loved it so much, I went and bought it.  Now I've seen it a few more times... and, well, I don't love it as much.  Since I see so many movies over and over again, I get to know what makes a truly great romantic comedy... this isn't one of them.The idea is good.  A man who doesn't want to marry has to.  Sounds like a great romantic comedy.  I guess it's just little things that sort of make me groan inside.  I think part of it is how many women are willing to just take their lives and surrender them to a man they don't even know--after he asks all the women he does know and they turn him down.  Also, how is it that these women conveniently have wedding dresses?  While the sea of white running up and down the streets of San Francisco is a good image, it's also pretty corny.Renee Zellweger saves this movie.  She's hilarious and charming--it's no wonder Chris O'Donnell's character (Jimmie) falls in love with her.  Every scene of her after one of Jimmie's proposals are excellent.It's a decent movie to see if you're in the mood for a no-thinking chick flick.  There are parts that I love to watch.

What a tragic waste of high-quality character actors!With the likes of Asner, Holbrook, Cromwell, one would have hoped for something entertaining, but even these  three (and whoever it was they got to pretend to be Oliver Platt) are  incapable of overcoming the feeble script and overwhelming aura of vapidity  emanating from the Boy Wonder himself, Chris O'Donnell.The problem with  O'Donnell is that, as an actor with this part, he has to convince the  viewer that he is commitment-phobic. In order to do so, he has to overcome  his very public persona as the most domesticated, least dangerous man in  young Hollywood today. He is the anti-Christian Slater. Forget Michael J.  Fox, this man has no Elvis in him.The beginning of the movie compares  bachelorhood to being a &quot;mustang.&quot; A rather pathetic comparison,  and it doesn't work -- O'Donnell seems more like a puppy that just is eager  to please.O'Donnell doesn't deserve all the blame. The screenplay is a  lackadaisical hash. The direction is, at best, standard. Somehow, the  sequence involving an army of brides marauding through San Francisco,  chasing after Chris O'Donnell (one hopes for a bacchanal rending of the  flesh), loses its potential for giddy absurdity. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is  adequate in her stomping and frustration with her boyfriend, but it is  surely not enough to compensate.A couple of bright spots: An academic  shoots down O'Donnell's proposal, leaving one to wonder how they ended up  dating each other in the first place. Brooke Shields has a great cameo as a  desperate but snotty socialite who is tricked into accepting O'Donnell's  offer. As she gradually learns what her future entails, she gets cold feet  and recovers, each time her panic growing.Anybody hoping for top-notch  comic timing, believable acting, a clever plot, with witty leads, should  look somewhere else. It's just not a very good romance when you just hope  that the heroine would get a life and that the hero gets run over by a  streetcar.",1,"Oh!

In order to inherit a fortune left by his  grandfather, he has to find a bride within 24 hours. He proposes marriage  to all of his ex-girlfriends, which by the way, is one of the highlights of  the film. There are cameo appearances by Mariah Carey and Brooke Shields.  But he doesn't want to marry these women; he wants to marry the woman he  loves (Renee Zellweger). She had dumped him because he had refused to  commit.

Men feel it's all about surrendering their freedom to their new wives, not being able to hang out w/the guys anymore &amp; having to ask for permission to do stuff that they used to do routinely.  Wild bachelor parties are typically a symbolic gesture of the guy's last night of happiness and freedom before his autonomy is erased.For women, on the  other hand, the institution of marriage is often thought of in fairy-talesque ways.  The prince marries the princess and they live happily ever after.  The gentleman chooses the most romantic locale and the most perfect day to pop the question.  Then, when he does ask for her hand in marriage, he does it with a poetic eloquence that would rival Keats.The present movie pokes fun @ both men and women for their pre-conceived notions about marriage.  Chris O'Donnell plays a happy-go-lucky independent male who has not yet hit 30.  He has seen his friends get &quot;picked off&quot; one-by-one by the marital epidemic.Meanwhile, the ultra-adorable Renee Zelwegger plays a young woman who has been bred on all the popular fiction about how &quot;perfect&quot; everything will be when she gets married.  She's also expecting a breathtakingly perfect evening in which her man will offer her the rest of his life.As you have probably guessed, these two protaganists fall in love but their different viewpoints cause a great deal of friction.  The result is nothing short of a hilarious satire on the differences in how men &amp; women look over a lifelong bond.There are some zany twists &amp; turns in the plot, but that is the main gist of the storyline.

This is a remake of the 1925 Buster Keaton classic, `Seven Chances' and this story has been trotted out a number of times since in various forms so the  material is far from fresh. Jimmie Shannon (Chris O'Donnell) is a confirmed  bachelor who finds himself in love with Anne (Rene Zellweger). As his  friends begin dropping like flies to the marriage bug, Jimmie realizes that  his time too has come. So he proposes to Anne, but he botches it, making it  so unromantic that despite desperately wanting to accept, she runs from the  room. When his grandfather dies, he discovers that he is the sole heir to a  vast fortune of $100 million, but to get it, he needs to get married by  6:05 PM on his birthday, which as it happens is the following day. With his  one true love gone, he must marry someone, so he begins a litany of  successive proposals to all his old girlfriends.The story is utterly  predictable and overly zany. It is comedy in its simplest and most  unsophisticated form. Slapstick, if done well can be very funny, and this  was done well. There were numerous belly laughs in this film from the many  sight gags and absurd situations that develop. The romance between Jimmie  and Anne was also charming.The direction by Gary Sinyor was nothing  special from a visual standpoint, but I felt he handled the setup of the  sight gags well and did a good job of orchestrating the movement of the  thousand or so brides in the chase scene (worthy of any Keystone Kops  skit). The special effects on the Mustang scenes were pretty weak,  though.Chris O'Donnell was very good in his role as Jimmie. His comedic  timing was effective and he succeeded in looking totally hapless in his  various scenes with erstwhile girlfriends. I thought his chemistry with  Zellweger was excellent and sincere, especially at the end.Rene  Zellweger was a good choice for this role. Though she is no goddess, she  has a very natural, sweet and wholesome attractiveness; very real and  vulnerable. She really made the romantic part of the story work  single-handedly with her misty eyed looks and genuine longing for  Jimmie.I rated this film an 8/10. I enjoy this kind of silly romantic  farce, but it is not for everyone. It requires an ability to laugh at  absurd, pratfall humor. If you are in the mood for a good light date movie,  this might be a good choice.

It starred Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger and had a remarkable assortment of big names in smaller supporting roles. I'm amazed at this cast. However, the whole thing was a complete bomb. It was a comedy that just turned out to be embarrassing in it's effort to be funny. O'Donnell came across more as a dip, suffering from a terminal case of foot-in-mouth disease, than a leading man, which would be okay for a comedy if it was funny. It wasn't. To her credit, Zellweger was one of the few cast members that was at least partly believable. Ed Asner and some of the other big names should crawl in a hole.In any case, O'Donnell played a bachelor who had reached the old age of 30. His obnoxious grandfather thought he should be married and left him 100 million dollars in his will provided he was married within about a week. Well, he completely goofed his proposal to his rather nice girlfriend (Zellweger) and then went on a streak of asking everyone he had been going out with in his recent history in order to meet the fast-closing deadline in the will. One by one. You guessed it. All blunders, and all rejections. How dumb can something get? Next, his plight got into the newspapers and hundreds of potential bridesmaids, all dressed in wedding gowns and all with their eyes on the $100 million, streamed after him in riotous fashion. We're supposed to laugh. Get it? This movie just got to be so bad that I couldn't bear to sit through it until the end. Enough! I breathed a sigh of relief as I turned it off.

Of course LTPF is a very different kettle of fish than THE BACHELOR, but both movies exhibit a very vibrant borrowing from silent film and its subtleties.  Sinyor also directed STIFF UPPER LIPS, the parody movie that gave stuffy Merchant-Ivory movies a good shaking up.  PIG FARMER is out on DVD but only in the UK, in the meantime let's go to THE BACHELOR and see what's up.  Well, it didn't do well at the box office, and studio moguls blamed Sinyor for its failure; what a blow for him, and he hasn't been given the chance to make another movie in the six years since then!  (Although happily BOB THE BUTLER will be coming out hopefully by the end of the year, the movie that re-unites Sinyor with his BACHELOR star Brooke Shields.Chris O'Donnell was doing very well, too, and then along came THE BACHELOR and a few other flops and before long he was regarded as box office poison.  There was something about him that perhaps people didn't like, shame too, because he's definitely capable and he's also ready to step up and make a fool of himself for a laugh, something not every actor is willing to do.  All these things combine in THE BACHELOR, a comedy romp set in San Francisco in which Chris plays the heir to a fortune of $120 million dollars, but there's a catch, he must marry within 24 hours, and the woman he loves, Renee Zellweger, isn't ready to say yes.  So he proposes to a lot of women during the course of the movie.  Naturally they all think he's crazy.  This has its origin in the old silent classic 7 CHANCES, with Buster Keaton, but it provides a lot of opportunities for some talented actresses.  Look out for wonderful Stacy Edwards, the deaf heroine of IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, in a lighter vein here!  But the show belongs to Chris O'Donnell, and to a lesser extent Renee Zellweger in whose career this is only a blip.

Chris O'Donnell has been inThe Sisters,Kinsey& received a Golden Globe supporting actor nomination forScent of a Woman.  As Jimmy Shannon who is given a day to get married before he turns 30 or lose a huge inheritance, he's delightful as the reluctant groom.  His grandfather is played as a cranky hard-of-hearing geezer by Peter Ustinov who would later pass away in 2004.  Ustinov won two supporting actor Oscars forSpartacusin 1960 &Topkapiin 1965.  Renee Zellweger who won her supporting actress Oscar forCold Mountain (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)plays Ann, Jimmy's girlfriend.  When Jimmy botches his proposal to Ann, he sets on a wild goose chase to secure a bride.  James Cromwell, from TV's ""24"" & ""Six Feet Under"" who also has a supporting Oscar nomination for ""Babe"" in 1995, plays the long-faced priest who follows Jimmy's every move.  Hal Holbrook plays O'Dell who tries to assist Jimmy. Holbrook had his first Oscar nomination forInto the Wildin 2007.  Among the ill-fated fiancees is Maria Carey as the operatic Ilana who barely remembers Jimmy.  Brooke Shields plays Buckley for laughs as the superficial society-climbing golddigger.  Shields would also play in director Gary Sinyor's next film ""Bob the Butler.""  Jennifer Esposito who was in the Oscar winnerCrash (Widescreen Edition)plays policewoman Daphne.  Also memorable is Maree Cheatham as the enamored Aunt of Ann, Mona Arden, who has a hard time keeping her hands off her aging spouse.

It's never going to an Oscar winning movie, but lets face it, not many movies I watch (!) are.OK, my first quibble is the horrible, horrible, region 1 cover, which you can see on the main page for this DVD. Chris O'Donnell looks positively ancient on it. The region 2 cover looks so much better. Is that a grey hair I see? Also Renee Zellweger obviously doesn't have the standing in Hollywood today to have someone do her hair for her. The poodle perm is so not a good look.Look out for Brooke Shields, as an ex of Jimmy's, and also Mariah Carey, playing a very diva-ish (opera) singer. That must have been hard for her to play. She also plays an ex of Jimmy's.The best scenes in the whole movie have to be towards the end, when Jimmy's $100 million, gimme a bride newspaper advert appears. Literally thousands of brides appear and chase him, and several of them are actually guys in drag. I would not have liked to see the dry cleaning bill after all those ladies (and gents) were finished with them!The worst bits about this movie was the horrendous cliche about men being unable to commit, and giving up their 'bachelorhood' and no longer being able to sew their wild oats as the saying goes. Men are horribly portrayed in this, including an old geezer trying to give Jimmy his 15-year-old daughter as a bride. Women are also horrifically portrayed; when all the brides gathered, none of them are ""classically"" attractive. They were all nearly ugly, old, butch, fat, you name it, all of womankind's flaws were represented. And to make it even worse, some of them were MEN!!!Not many people will agree with my review, so bring on the bad votes guys, cos I'm ready for it. So there. It's not an Oscar winning movie.

Chris O'Donnell stars as a good-natured guy who adores his adorable girlfriend (Renee Zellweger), but just can't commit to her, just can't work himself into a marrying man. And so she leaves. Unfortunately, it's right about now that O'Donnell's grumpy grandfather (Peter Ustinov) kicks the proverbial bucket. And what does gramp's do? Yes, that's right, he leaves the millions of dollars behind for O'Donnell, but only if he marries by the time he is 30 years old. O'Donnell doesn't really want the hassle, but the family-owned company wil get the hostile take-over treatment if he doesn't come up with the money to save it. So what does O'Donnell do? He chases down Zellweger, who can see in his eyes that he's not coming from the heart. She refuses and O'Donnell is forced to track down every ex-girlfriend he's ever had, imploring them to marry him. Of course, O'Donnell soon realizes that true love was right there all along, but now it might be too late.It's a terribly familiar plot, and it's put across with increasing desperation and sentimentality. Even a wonderful cast can't salvage the mess. O'Donell is all charm, no depth. Zellwegger makes every word and every emotion feel real, but it's as if she's in a different, better movie. Marley Shelton, a rising star, scores points as Zellwegger's supportive sister, while Ed Asner and Hal Holbrook chew the scenery as O'Donnell's friends/advisers, and James Cromwell treads weater (barely hiding his embarrassment) as a priest who sticks with O'Donnellm in case he finds Mrs. Right.Director Gary Sinyor tries every old trick in the book, from quick cuts to dream sequences, from cameos to blaring songs. Too bad Sinyor didn't let the story do the job.As it stands, any marriage between The Bachelor and its audience is bound to be brief and movie-goers can cite a premeditated overdose of schmaltz for the inevitable break-up.",2,Wedded miss.,973296000,"11 4, 2000",2000,1964,"['Sugary-sweet', 'woefully', 'lame', 'Bachelor', 'way', 'altar', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'good-natured', 'guy', 'who', 'adorable', 'girlfriend', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'commit', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'marrying', 'man', 'so', 'Unfortunately', 'right', 'about', 'now', ""O'Donnell"", 'grumpy', 'grandfather', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'proverbial', 'bucket', 'what', 'gramp', 'do', 'Yes', 'right', 'millions', 'dollars', ""O'Donnell"", 'only', 'time', '30', 'years', 'old', ""O'Donnell"", ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'hassle', 'family-owned', 'company', 'get', 'hostile', 'take-over', 'treatment', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'money', 'save', 'So', 'what', ""O'Donnell"", 'do', 'down', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'not', 'coming', 'heart', ""O'Donnell"", 'forced', 'track', 'down', 'ex-girlfriend', 'ever', 'had', 'imploring', 'marry', 'course', ""O'Donnell"", 'soon', 'true', 'love', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'all', 'along', 'now', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'late.It', 'terribly', 'familiar', 'plot', 'put', 'increasing', 'desperation', 'sentimentality', 'Even', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'salvage', 'mess', ""O'Donell"", 'charm', 'depth', 'Zellwegger', 'word', 'emotion', 'feel', 'real', 'different', 'better', 'movie', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'rising', 'star', 'points', 'Zellwegger', 'supportive', 'sister', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'chew', 'scenery', ""O'Donnell"", 'friends/advisers', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'weater', 'barely', 'hiding', 'embarrassment', 'priest', 'who', ""O'Donnellm"", 'case', 'Mrs.', 'Right.Director', 'Gary', 'Sinyor', 'old', 'trick', 'book', 'quick', 'cuts', 'dream', 'sequences', 'cameos', 'blaring', 'songs', 'Too', 'bad', 'Sinyor', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'story', 'do', 'job.As', 'marriage', 'Bachelor', 'audience', 'bound', 'be', 'brief', 'movie-goers', 'can', 'cite', 'premeditated', 'overdose', 'schmaltz', 'inevitable', 'break-up']",N/A

Of course, this leads to a lot of running after Anne, who dumped him previously due to a botched marriage proposal the night before.  In between his friends try and fix him up with a few celebrity cameos such as Mariah Carey.O'Donnell is quite unable to carry a movie by himself and Zellweger's endearing character isn't on screen nearly as much as you'd like her to be.  The list of cameos is perhaps reason enough to watch this, and to be fair there is one genuinely funny scene where Jimmie is chased down the street by hundreds of wannabe brides.

36093,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,0780628535,Nicholas Carroll,"[4, 5]","Years before ABC started their own ""Reality TV show"" about a Bachelor having to choose from a group of marriage-minded women, there was this film, which I didn't see until just recently.  Like most romantic comedies, it follows the same formula of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy grovels to win back girl and they marry and live happily ever after.  Pretty standard, unoriginal, and uninspired...and this film starts off that way and doesn't really take off until the bachelor (played by Chris O'Donnell) views a video will of his grandfather.  Therein lies the premise...The bachelor is the last of his friends to get married, and his grandfather wants to ensure that his genetic line doesn't die off if his grandson doesn't do his manly duty: matrimony and parenthood.  But the grandfather dies and makes a condition on the inheritence (shades of ""Brewster's Millions""--which is thankfully mentioned in this film)...the bachelor will inherit $100 million only if he marries before he turns 30 years old to the exact minute of his birth.  And, the marriage has to last at least ten years and produce offspring before he will get to see the money.  Since the bachelor turns 30 a week later, he begins calling his exs in desperate attempt to find a bride, since the love of his life was insulted by his non-proposal earlier (instead of ""will you marry me?"" he states his case pro and con regarding marriage and tells Renee Zellweger ""you win!"").I loved the surprise cameos of his exs, which I won't reveal here so first time viewers can be surprised themselves.  They cameos of some famous ladies were a nice touch to lift this film out of the standard cliches of the romantic comedy genre.  What clinches this movie for me, in terms of originality and humor is the running of the brides through the streets of San Francisco.  Its completely zany and unbelievable, but romantic comedies do have quirks like these to stand out above the rest.  The scene is just so outlandishly funny and well done that I thought it saved the movie as a whole.  Its reminiscent of ""the running of the bulls"" in Pamplona, Spain...and considering that Chris O'Donnell played Ernest Hemingway in ""In Love and War"", I thought that was a nice touch.There is one major discrepancy with this film.  The brides chasing the groom begins at the Amtrak station and its not long until they are running the streets of San Francisco (North Beach?)...yet that is a near impossibility.  The Amtrak station is actually across the bay in Emeryville, not San Francisco...so anyone who has been there knows that the makers of this film used a lot of creative license to make the climatic scene flow.Overall, an amusing film, though by no means a great one.

36100,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0780628535,Reviewer,"[3, 4]","Anytime you come across a comedy that's well written, superbly acted and delivered, and really funny to boot, it's a treat.  Unfortunately, ""The Bachelor,"" directed by Gary Sinyor, is not one of them.  Beginning with the  voice-over narration of star Chris O'Donnell, which draws an inane analogy  between young, single, American males and wild mustangs, and on through the  rest of the contrivances of the lame story, right to the end, this movie is  a disaster.  Right out of the gate, it breaks the first rule of successful  comedy:  Play it straight, and they will laugh.  O'Donnell reads the  narrative in a lilting, sing-song manner that plays down to the audience;  it implies, ""This is funny, you can laugh now.""  Never mind that it isn't  funny, that there's nothing at all in what he's saying that makes you want  to laugh.  The intent, I believe, with this movie, was to make a romantic  comedy; what they ended up with is the most unromantic drivel you can  possibly imagine.  When Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell) asks his girlfriend of  three years, Anne (Renee Zellweger), to marry him, she turns him down  because his proposal is so crass; the worst ever made.  Ironically, it  comes in one of the worst scenes possibly ever filmed.  Watching it takes  you out of the story and almost makes you embarrassed for the actors.  The  next day, Jimmie's grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies and leaves him over one  hundred million dollars, provided he is married by 6:05 p.m. (the time he  was born) on his thirtieth birthday, which happens to be in ""Twenty-seven  hours and change.""  Since the girl he loves has given him the gate (and  rightfully so, because this guy is a real jerk) he spends the rest of the  movie contacting old girlfriends, trying to find one who is willing to  marry him.  And for the audience, it makes for nothing more than one long,  make that LONG, endurance test.  O'Donnell brings nothing to the  character of Jimmie; he is merely boring and tiresome.  Talk about a less  than sympathetic character.  Renee Zellweger, whose career has been on a  roll since ""Jerry MaGuire"" goes into a tailspin here.  She does her best  with what she has to work with, but it's not enough.  That there's no  chemistry between Anne and Jimmie is not her fault; O'Donnell is just so  unappealing in this role, he couldn't make sparks with a flint.  The  talented supporting cast, which includes Hal Holbrook (O'Dell), Ed Asner  (Gluckman), James Cromwell (Priest), Artie Lange (Marco) and Marley Shelton  (Natalie) is wasted here, as well.  Mariah Carey makes a brief,  inauspicious appearance as one of Jimmie's former girlfriends, Ilana, in a  scene better for all concerned had it wound up on the cutting room floor.  The single high point (if you can call it that) amid all of this dreck, is  the scene in which Brooke Shields turns in a notable performance as  Buckley, another of Jimmie's girlfriends.  She plays her with an aloofness  that actually makes her endearing; and to find that in the midst of this  film is a minor triumph.  To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a  bad movie.  There's not a laugh to be had, and even the attempted slapstick  and sight gags fall short, which proves that nothing can save a project  that begins with a screenplay as acerbic and obtuse as this one.  Personally, I refuse to walk out on even the worst movies, or to even turn  off a video without sticking it out to the bitter end; it's like a code I  live by.

But his uncertainty about the change in lifestyle causes him to botch the proposal so badly that she refuses.  Soon after, his grandfather dies leaving him 100 million dollars in assets, with one catch. Jimmy must be married by his 30th birthday or he won't get a cent.  The bad news is, his 30th birthday is in 24 hours.  From there begins a rush against time, first to find his girlfriend and try to change her mind, and then when that fails to find any eligible woman who will agree to marry him on short notice. Will Jimmie realize that he wants to get married after all, and will he get the girl he actually loves?About the Movie:In many ways, The Bachelor is an utterly delightful movie, despite its flaws here and there.One of the most refreshing things I found in this movie was the positive view that was eventually given to marriage.  O'Donnel's character goes from a single man who enjoys his single and somewhat philanderous lifestyle to a man who understands the joy of committing heart, soul and body to another person.  He comes to realize that some things in life are more important than money or sex. The neatest part about all this is how he comes to this realization.  It comes partly through his attempts to find a wife on short notice, but mostly it comes in the voice of a role model that is almost universally denigrated in movies these days... a priest. I found that to be a nice change.Plotwise, this film is standard romantic comedy material. Boy loses girl, boy seeks girl, girl makes things difficult, boy gets girl.  What makes this movie special is the offbeat way the whole situation is presented and eventually resolved.  It's just plain fun, especially that memorable chase scene near the end.The supporting cast (which includes Hal Holbrook, Artie Lang, James Cromwell and Edward Asner) is excellent in this film, though at times a little overplayed. James Cromwell's priest is downright charming and O'Donnell plays his role as the uncertain bachelor rather convincingly. Together with the rest of the cast they make for some great and entertaining comedic moments that are laugh out loud funny.The only really low spot as far as acting goes is Anne. Renee Zellweger is ok in her role as Anne, but as an actress, I feel she has a tendency to come off as a ditzy blond.  Her character suffered a little from that, making her, at least for me, a lot less appealing as the female lead than she could have been.Like many comedies these days, the Bachelor also suffers from the sex syndrome so prevalent in modern movies.  Jimmie has clearly slept around a lot in the past, and it's implied that he and Anne are 'intimate.'  Just once I'd like to see a romantic comedy without any sex involved, with a guy who's saving himself for the one he wants to spend his life with.  I guess that's too much to hope for. But, I suppose in this movie, the lifestyle fits why he's not so eager to abandon it.The other issue with this film is the language. The language in The Bachelor is often unnecessarily crude (usually sexual references or unfortunate potty colloquialisms) pushing the rating up to PG-13. It could have been a better, more family friendly film had they kept some of the language a little tamer and less earthy.  It hurt the movie, and it didn't have to.In the end, some of this film is a little clich&eacute;d, but overall it holds together pretty well, and makes the payoff at the end definitely worth it. Over all, the Bachelor is a fairly entertaining movie that makes a great date film (if you can overlook the language).About the DVD:The Bachelor comes in a cardboard snap case on a single-sided DVD in Widescreen and fullscreen formats with Dolby Digital 5.1 or regular stereo surround sound.  This movie's audio tracks are only available in English, and the subtitles only come in English as well. There are no foreign language subtitle or audio tracks on this DVD.The picture on this DVD is exceptionally clean, even on high resolution screens.  This is what DVDs are supposed to look like. The sound is decent, though nothing that will knock you out of your seat.The special features on this DVD are what you normally see on budget DVD releases, the theatrical trailer for the movie and a cast filmography section. This DVD release has the added bonus, however, of being a PC DVD-ROM with extra features when played on a computer.  These include a script to screen feature, access to the original theatrical website and a links to wedding resources.I've always found the script to screen feature on DVD's to be fascinating. While it's really only any interest to those who enjoy the finer points of film making, it's interesting to read the script while the movie plays.  I do have a complaint however.  The Script to screen feature forces you to watch the movie in fullscreen while reading the script.  As a fan of widescreen, I found that restriction a little annoying.Bottom Line: A fun film with some flaws on a budget DVD release with one significant extra.  I'd give it 3 Stars.",3,50'000 brides can't be wrong,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,5154,"['Synopsis', 'Jimmie', 'Shannon', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'unabashed', 'bachelor', 'girlfriend', 'Anne',

They are believeable as a  couple, which is essential to a good romance. The story is predictable, but  none the less, enjoyable and funny. Brooke Shields is hysterical as one of  O'Donnell's ex-girfriends who ponders marriage for the chance of inheriting  a fortune.

Happily, there's a lot for people on the verge of marriage, or just  those young at heart.  Though I think the same pre-wedding jitters are  fretted out with better style in, say, FORCES OF NATURE, this funny  adaptation of SEVEN CHANCES is still a great date flick-especially if you  already are engaged or married.Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger  turn in charming performances, but then again the acting in the film is  solid throughout.  Of special note in this regard is Brooke Shields, who  proves that her days on SUDDENLY SUSAN were good for at least one thing:  sharpening her comic timing.  And, though woefully underutilized, Hal  Holbrook and Ed Asner make a welcome return to the screen.To be sure,  there is nothing here of great originality.  You know from the title that  our heroes will make it down the aisle.  But the film is crafted well  enough that one genuinely cares about the HOW of it.  The writer has given  the audience predictable plot twists, but ones placed with skill.  Likewise, scenes are edited briskly enough that the comedy is fully  realized.  The effect of  both is a movie which does affect the audience,  even given its somewhat tired notions of gender roles.[DVD Notes:  Though this review is written prior to the release of the DVD, it's  disappointing to note that there are virtually no additional features.]",3,Fun date movie if marriage is on your mind,965347200,"08 4, 2000",2000,1437,"['amiable', 'film', 'solid', 'cast', 'nothing', 'Academy', 'see', 'here', 'Happily', 'lot', 'people', 'verge', 'marriage', 'just', 'young', 'heart', 'think', 'same', 'pre-wedding', 'jitters', 'are', 'fretted', 'out', 'better', 'style', 'say', 'FORCES', 'OF', 'NATURE', 'funny', 'adaptation', 'SEVEN', 'CHANCES', 'still', 'great', 'date', 'flick-especially', 'already', 'are', 'engaged', 'married.Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'turn', 'charming', 'performances', 'then', 'again', 'acting', 'film', 'solid', 'special', 'note', 'regard', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'who', 'days', 'SUDDENLY', 'SUSAN', 'were', 'good', 'least', 'one', 'thing', 'sharpening', 'comic', 'timing', 'though', 'woefully', 'underutilized', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'make', 'welcome', 'return', 'screen.To', 'be', 'sure', 'nothing', 'here', 'great', 'originality', 'know', 'title', 'heroes', 'will', 'make', 'down', 'aisle', 'film', 'crafted', 'well', 'enough', 'one', 'genuinely', 'HOW', 'writer', 'given', 'audience', 'predictable', 'plot', 'twists', 'ones', 'placed', 'skill', 'Likewise', 'scenes', 'are', 'edited', 'briskly', 'enough', 'comedy', 'fully', 'realized', 'effect', 'movie', 'affect', 'audience', 'even', 'given', 'somewhat', 'tired', 'notions', 'gender', 'roles', '[', 'DVD', 'Notes', 'review', 'written', 'prior', 'release', 'DVD', 'disappointing', 'note', 'are', 'virtually', 'additional', 'features', ']']",N/A
