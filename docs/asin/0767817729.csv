13897,A1ZPKKWT79C6HW,0767817729,"APC Reviews ""APC Reviews""","[127, 139]","This has always been one of my favorite Costner films. Usually, director's cuts of films include omitted material, that expands on and enhances the original film. Tony Scott, the director, has now brought out a director's cut that is actually more than fifteen minutes shorter than the original. He has ruined the film.It's not just that the film has been shortened, but new material, that obviously was left on the cutting room floor originally for a reason, has been reinserted, totally throwing off the rhythm of the film and, while perhaps making it ""faster"", has ruined much of the character development and added nothing. It's much worse.Main change are:* A scene where Costner arrives in Mexico and has a conversation with Tomas Milan, Quinn's #2 man, is shortened so that the animosity between Costner and Milan later on seems less logical.* The scene of Quinn and Costner walking toward the tented dining table outside the house, just after their first tennis match has been shortened., Two key piece of character development have been cut. First, where Costner and Quinn talk about Quinn's tennis skills as they approach the tent, and Costner tells Quinn that Quinn ""never concedes a point"". The second, after Costner has given Quinn a leather flight jacket. One of Quinn's dogs grabs the jacket in his teeth, and Quinn ruthlessly grabs the dog by the collar and hurls it into the swimming pool, amply displaying Quinn's capacity for brutality.* A scene with Anthony Quinn and Stowe, just after Costner arrives in Mexico, that helps explain Quinn's relationship to his wife and her place in his scheme of things has been cut.* In the scene where Costner and Stowe talk alone in the library during the dinner party at Quinn's house, the part of the scene where Stowe enters and finds Costner reading a book of Spanish poetry, one of her favorite books it turns out, and he recites several lines in Spanish, and relates a story of his time serving in the Air Force while stationed in Spain, has been cut. This deprives the characters of one of the most important early empathetic links, that they are intellectually and culturally more attuned to each other than to the others around them. This also cuts Costner's line ""Did I just blow your mind?"", after he reads a passage aloud in Spanish and then translates it into English. This makes Stowe's use of this same line later in the scene, when she tells of how she came to be married, and Costner's line ""it's not polite to mimic people..."" rather odd and out of nowhere.* The scene where Quinn and Stowe talk by the pool after the party, as Quinn emerges from a late night swim and dons a robe, has been cut. In this scene Stowe asks what happened to Diaz, one of the men at the party, who Quinn had executed right in the house just moments before. He lies about the man's whereabouts. This is an important character defining scene for Quinn and shows Stowe's disquiet at her husband's unspoken but suspected activities.* In the scene at Costner's beach bungalow, the day after the party, Stowe suddenly appears, holding a book. The sequence where she gives it to Costner has been cut, as the preceding scene in the library with the book has been cut also. Nevertheless, on the next cut Costner is holding the book, with no explanation of how it passed between them or what it's import is.* In the scene where Costner and Stowe walk on the beach, the sequence where Costner tells Stowe about his failed marriage has had an alternate take substituted, with much vaguer dialog and poorer acting. Once again, this deprives the characters of the prior material that had showed their empathetic feel for each other.* In the scene at the beach where Costner shows Stowe the trick his dog can do, and Stowe dares him to let her try it, the scene of the actual trick has been substituted with an alternative angle and take that is far less effective and satisfying than the original.* In the same beach walk scene, a further sequence of Costner and Stowe talking as they walk along, that gave Stowe's character nuance, empathy and dignity, has been cut, and previously cut footage of Stowe standing before Costner on the beech in a totally phony rain shower has been reinserted. This ruins what had been a charming classic bit of Costner business, and deletes a very sexy bit of chat between Costner and Stowe. Tony Scott seems intent on purging any hint of intellectual or cultural empathy between the characters, and seems determined to reduce them to comic book characters or. worse, just images of desire and attraction in a perfume or beer commercial.* The scene of Costner trying to make lemonade in the kitchen of his beach bungalow while Stowe watches, that originally appeared before they went for their walk on the beach, has been shortened, cutting intimacy between the two, and now appears before they go for their walk on the beach. This scene was the payoff of the beach sequence, that showed the growing sexual awareness and tension between the two.* At the political victory party, Costner appears in his jacket, Then he is suddenly standing at the buffet table without it. The short bit where a maid asks him if she can take his coat has been cut, which then makes it somewhat less obvious why Costner has gone to the room where guests coats are being kept, where he meets Stowe for their first love making.* The scene where Costner and Stowe talk while standing by the swimming pool at the party has been cut. In this scene Costner comments on the between the lines nature of their relationship, telling her he didn't come down to Mexico to get into trouble, and looks up to notice Tomas Milan observing them from a balcony. Without this scene the later scenes where Quinn implies he knows there is something going on between Costner and Stowe seem more abrupt and from out of nowhere.* New music has been added to the sex in the coat room sequence that is both annoying and distracting. The scene has been lengthened and made more explicit. The prior music, what might have been considered a ""love theme"", that was synergistic with both the party music outside and the theme music of the film, has been cut. The sex scene is now more explicit, brutal, senseless, and less interesting.* The scene of Stowe attempting to talk to Costner while she sits in his jeep outside Quinn's house, after a tennis game, has been cut. Once again, this is a direct attack on any material that would waste time on showing the adult level empathy and chemistry between the characters, anything that would reveal why they are, as human beings, so hot for each other.* The original scene of Costner and Stowe after love making in a hotel room has been cut and replaced with a shorter alternate angle and take of them in bed that explains less about their characters but clumsily foreshadows plot developments.* The scene of Coster and Stowe in the justly well known make out sequence while Coster is driving his Jeep has had the music replaced with a more contemporary track that totally changes the rhythm and feel of the scene.* The scene of Costner and Stowe swimming nude has been lengthened with previously cut footage of them hanging out and carousing, and Stowe doing a sexy dance, getting all over Costner in what appears to oral sex, and Costner drinking a beer. It totally ruins the feel of the sequence, and makes Stowe's character look cheap and vulgar, where before she had seem almost regal.* For reasons that are incomprehensible, the love making scene between Costner and Stowe at Costner's mountain cabin, a pivotal scene in the film that is prelude to the savage beating they both are about to take from Quinn, has been radically shortened, completely cutting a sequence where they talk in bed about ther lives and Costner tells about his war experiences.* The sequence where Costner convalesces with a Mexican peasant family while recovering from the beating he received from Quinn's men now includes a completely gratuitous and pointless scene of Costner helping the farmer get his old truck running.* Sally Kirkland's part has been cut down.* The scene at the end at the convent where Costner carries Stowe in his arms outside, where she dies, has been cut down and is now far less visually interesting and compelling.* Numerous small bits of dialog have ben cut, and a few extra bits of footage added that either obscure the character development or add nothing to the story.In short: one of the very best Costner films, and one of the best Tony Scott films, has been ruined by the director himself. If some of the cut footage had been added back to the original version it might have been supportable, and added to an already great film. To not offer both the original and the new version on the same Blu-Ray disc is just ridiculous.Shame on you Tony Scott! You have purged and cut every adult moment, every reflective passage, every poetic instinct and every empathetic gesture and utterance from the characters, all in the name of speeding up the film and getting a few more seconds in of Madeleine Stowe in sex scenes. You have needlessly used cutting room trims that were clearly left, perhaps under the adult supervision of Ray Stark, on the cutting room floor for good reason.Now we will never get a proper version of Revenge on Blu-Ray. Other than the obvious technical superiority of the Blu-Ray disc to the DVD version, there is no reason to buy this edition.",1,"Tony Scott has ruined this film with ""director's cut"" changes...

The story is about a recently discharged Navy pilot (Kevin Costner) who travels down to visit an old friend in Mexico (Anthony Quinn).  The dude also just so happens to be a Mexican mobster.  Falling prey to a lapse in judgment, Costner's character falls in love with the mobster's eye-candy wife (portrayed by Madeline Stowe).So far, this sounds like a typical love-triangle film.  However, this one has some very violent & sometimes deadly twists and turns.  It contains a lot of raw sexual energy and violent scenes.  It is also necessary to forewarn people that it has some harsh and disturbing clips that detail violence against women.The whole movie pivots on the performance of Madeline Stowe.  Her character is the axis around which everything else in the film revolves around.  I will make no apologies in saying that I am perhaps Madeline Stowe's single greatest fan, and THIS is a movie that details why.  There are certainly a great many gorgeous women in the world.  Precious few of them can act, however.  Madeline is one of those few.  IF this film had starred a drop dead starlet with little or no acting skills, it simply would not have worked.  Period - I don't care if she was on the cover of every major fashion magazine.  This movie demanded a female leading lady who could act, and Madeline delivers.  She is a dynamic actress and she has a certain elegance about her which I find mesmerizing.The opening scene shows Costner's character on his last flight in the Navy, piloting an F-14.  Watching it, it is fairly obvious that the director (Tony Scott) also directed the widely acclaimed TOP GUN.  However, in spite of the aerial acrobats of the fighter and all of the guns and violence in the movie, the story has a subtle timbre about it which I find remarkable.  Stylistically, this is perhaps Tony Scott's best movie ever.As a bonus, the special features contain a retrospective by Kevin Costner, Madeline and Tony Scott nearly 20 years after the film's release.  All 3 offer insights into their take on the importance of the film and the respect they had for the project.So, if you are looking for a movie that is mostly a love story & a drama with a few elements of action flicks mixed in, REVENGE is worth checking out.  The characterization is intersting in that the hero falls well short of being a paragon of moral virtue.  There is also some interesting symbolism with his dog tags & flight jacket.  All in all, this is a story which I believe will strike a chord with both male & female viewers.",4,Revenge is a dish best served......,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,2587,"['Well', ""n't"", 'get', 'cold', 'Mexico', 'one', 'out', 'story', 'recently', 'discharged', 'Navy', 'pilot', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'who', 'travels', 'down', 'visit', 'old', 'friend', 'Mexico', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'dude', 'also', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'Mexican', 'mobster', 'Falling', 'prey', 'lapse', 'judgment', 'Costner', 'character', 'love', 'mobster', 'eye-candy', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', '.So', 'far', 'typical', 'love-triangle', 'film', 'However', 'one', 'very', 'violent', 'sometimes', 'deadly', 'twists', 'turns', 'lot', 'raw', 'sexual', 'energy', 'violent', 'scenes', 'also', 'necessary', 'forewarn', 'people', 'harsh', 'disturbing', 'clips', 'detail', 'violence', 'women.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'pivots', 'performance', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'character', 'axis', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'apologies', 'saying', 'am', 'perhaps', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'single', 'greatest', 'fan', 'THIS', 'movie', 'details', 'why', 'are', 'certainly', 'great', 'many', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'world', 'Precious', 'few', 'can', 'act', 'however', 'Madeline', 'one', 'few', 'IF', 'film', 'had', 'starred', 'drop', 'dead', 'starlet', 'little', 'acting', 'skills', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'Period', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'cover', 'major', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'movie', 'demanded', 'female', 'leading', 'lady', 'who', 'could', 'act', 'Madeline', 'delivers', 'dynamic', 'actress', 'certain', 'elegance', 'find', 'mesmerizing.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'Costner', 'character', 'last', 'flight', 'Navy', 'piloting', 'F-14', 'Watching', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'also', 'directed', 'widely', 'acclaimed', 'TOP', 'GUN', 'However', 'spite', 'aerial', 'acrobats', 'fighter', 'guns', 'violence', 'movie', 'story', 'subtle', 'timbre', 'find', 'remarkable', 'Stylistically', 'perhaps', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'best', 'movie', 'bonus', 'special', 'features', 'contain', 'retrospective', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Madeline', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'film', 'release', '3', 'offer', 'insights', 'take', 'importance', 'film', 'respect', 'had', 'project.So', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'mostly', 'love', 'story', 'drama', 'few', 'elements', 'action', 'flicks', 'mixed', 'REVENGE', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'characterization', 'intersting', 'hero', 'well', 'short', 'being', 'paragon', 'moral', 'virtue', 'also', 'interesting', 'symbolism', 'dog', 'tags', 'flight', 'jacket', 'story', 'believe', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'male', 'female', 'viewers']",N/A
13907,A17C46GMYHZHPE,0767817729,"EmeraldAccord66 ""Rebecca""","[1, 1]","After reading all of the comments/reviews about the Unrated Director's Cut of Revenge I have to agree with most that this version has been edited a bit too much and a lot of the good scenes from the original version cut which I didn't like and couldn't understand. But if you watch and listen to Tony Scott's interview on this DVD after watching the movie, you will find out that he wanted it this way because he wanted to delete all of the boring scenes and get straight to the heart of the story which he did and did an excellent job at that. So true! So now I do understand why this version was cut shorter than the original. It makes sense and really I think it's made the movie more heart felt if anything. So, I have to agree with Tony Scott on this because after watching the movie I have to admit I really like this version MUCH better than the original. Now, here's my opinion ... if only they could combine the original version with this Unrated Director's Cut version and add everything together it would literally make it an EPIC like Scarface or The Godfather! I would've loved to have seen a follow up to this movie like a Part II. Why? Because of course Tibby was still alive when Cochran left him under the tree after finding out Miyrea is in a convent. Most people probably would've liked to have believed the two new friends of Cochran's (sidekicks) that helped him find Miyrea, shot and killed Tibby right after Cochran left them under the tree. But I choose to believe different. I would like to believe they let him live knowing what more could Tibby do to his old friend Cochran because he knew Miyrea was dying in the convent and that would pretty much be the end of Cochran's life and world once she died in his arms in the end. But all to the contrary that's when I think things would really start to heat up even more between the two ex-friends in Mexico in a Part II sequel. I know that Anthony Quinn has long since died since this movie was made, June 3, 2001 to be exact but as always the producers could've always found another great actor to take his place which I feel would've been intriguing and something new to add to the movie, but of course keeping Costner in it but with a new love interest since Miyrea died in the first movie. or Cochran could stay single in the second part as his devotional love to Miyrea. Just a thought. Although Quinn was a huge force when he was alive as an actor and every time I think of Tibby in that movie I will always think of Quinn as no one in my book could've played the part better. But again, to combine these two versions of the movie to make one LONG EXTENDED version would be the BOMB!!! :) I would LOVE it with a passion as it's at the top of my list of favorite movies of all time. Hoping one day this will happen on DVD and Blue-Ray as well as a Part II sequel but not done cheesy as most Part II's are done. Hoping if anything it will equal the first if not better and still to have it all filmed in Mexico as the first was. But I seriously doubt this will ever take place as well as the extended version with both versions put together. Such a shame. This movie is truly a MASTERPIECE and should go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time! It's really the best parts both Costner and Stowe have ever made in their film careers I think.  Just love this movie and so glad I didn't go by other's comments about all of the editing and parts that were cut because I was seriously thinking about not getting it just for those reasons alone but so so glad I did because I really highly recommend this version, the Uncut Director's Version over the original. You be the judge. Watch both and decide for yourself. We're all different and we know what we like.With this all said ... would like to end by saying THANK YOU SO MUCH TONY SCOTT for making this movie come to life on the big screen! It's truly YOUR BEST EVER!!!! To add: the cinematography is to die for in this movie. Just love the landscape shots throughout the movie of parts of Mexico and the colors are just out of this world magnificent!!!

A just retired F-14 pilot, Costner is anxious for some peace and quiet in Mexico hanging out at his remote cabin with his dog, and whacking tennis balls with his mobster pal/father figure Tibby, played convincingly by Anthony Quinn. Somehow during the development of their relationship, Tibby forgot to mention that he had an extraordinarily hot wife, Madeline Stowe, with a biological clock in unfulfilled overdrive. (Note to self: when you are 75 and married to a hot and sexually frustrated 30 year old, keep her away from your stud jet jockey buddies.)OK, so we all know nothing good can come from this right. Well, Tibby finally gets a clue when he figures out why all the windows are steamed up in his desert villa, sets the dogs on our flyboy, and banishes his wife to a whore house where the proprietor is ordered to keep her hopped up on heroin while she is fed to the lowest rung of the social order they can drag up. Painful to watch actually as things appear to be semi-hopeless, but as the title suggests it ain't over til its over.This is a great study in friendship, passion, betrayal, revenge, and ultimately justice.

So, here is a little summary of the differences and I hope it helps you decide which version to get.The Original Version of Revenge: Is in Full Frame Format and is 123 minutes long.  It is Rated R.Revenge The Directions Cut:  Is in Widescreen format and is 100 minutes long.  This version is Unrated.Besides the differences listed above, one of the biggest differences in Revenge The Directions Cut is in the love scenes.  In particular, when Kevin Costner and Madeline Stowe are in the jeep and are on their way to Kevin's cabin, they have a sexual encounter.  I have to say it is on the pornographic side and it's kind of raunchy.  I think that's why this version is unrated.  But, besides this, if you notice Revenge The Directions Cut is actually 20% shorter than the Original Version.  They literally take out 1/5 of the story out and make this movie into just about a sexual affair and revenge.  Because of this, a lot of the story is missing, and we really miss out on the love between Kevin's character and Madeline's character.After watching these two versions, I would definitely recommend getting The Original Version of Revenge because it is a more complete story and we really see the love between and desire between the love struck couple.",5,The Two Versions of Revenge.,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,1388,"['are', 'two', 'different', 'versions', 'Revenge', 'one', 'little', 'different', 'have', 'versions', 'have', 'watched', 'So', 'here', 'little', 'summary', 'differences', 'hope', 'decide', 'version', 'get.The', 'Original', 'Version', 'Revenge', 'Full', 'Frame', 'Format', '123', 'minutes', 'long', 'Rated', 'R.Revenge', 'Directions', 'Cut', 'Widescreen', 'format', '100', 'minutes', 'long', 'version', 'differences', 'listed', 'one', 'biggest', 'differences', 'Revenge', 'Directions', 'Cut', 'love', 'scenes', 'particular', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'are', 'jeep', 'are', 'way', 'Kevin', 'cabin', 'have', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'have', 'say', 'pornographic', 'side', 'kind', 'raunchy', 'think', 'why', 'version', 'unrated', 'notice', 'Revenge', 'Directions', 'Cut', 'actually', '20', '%', 'shorter', 'Original', 'Version', 'literally', 'take', 'out', '1/5', 'story', 'make', 'movie', 'just', 'sexual', 'affair', 'revenge', 'lot', 'story', 'missing', 'really', 'miss', 'out', 'love', 'Kevin', 'character', 'Madeline', 'character.After', 'watching', 'two', 'versions', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'getting', 'Original', 'Version', 'Revenge', 'more', 'complete', 'story', 'really', 'see', 'love', 'desire', 'love', 'struck', 'couple']",N/A

While not flawless, it was always a perinneal favorite of mine, and I think captures something unique that I have never been able to put my finger on.  Maybe it's the underlying themes of chicken-or-the-egg revenge, the Tony Todesco soundtrack, the panoramic shots of the Mexican vistas, the pretty strong acting by some great famous, soon-to-be-famous, or character actors, the muted, hazy cinematography...there's a lot to love.  So, I hunkered down with the Bluray, excited to watch one of my Top 10 movies in high-def for the first time, and frankly the best I'd ever seen it (missed it in the theater, lots of times on VHS, and many more on 480p DVD).  Additional excitement; perhaps more scenes, hand selected by Tony Scott that would enrich the story and make a favorite even more so.Damn, I was disappointed. Almost immediately, I noticed GOOD dialogue and scenes missing.  Not extraneous, fluff stuff, but parts of the movie that foreshadowed and frankly enriched the characters and storyline.  There are actually parts that now make LESS sense with the edit than before.  The tension between Costner and Stowe was palatable in the theatrical version, but with so much of their initial story gone, it seemed overly rushed, and hard to understand how things progressed so quickly between them.  Tibby Mendez goes from jovial buddy of Costner to killer almost between takes, with the scene of him and the dog/leather jacket removed.  I could go on (and believe me, I did to everyone else watching it with me) but others here have included the complete list.I almost turned it off and popped in the standard-def theatrical version, it was that bad.  The only reason I give it a generous two stars is the picture quality is amazing.  The clarity of the cinematography is brilliant, and they didnt rob any of the hazy-Tony-Scott-look from it, only sharpened and enhanced it.  The sound is fantastic as well, and despite there being a Dolby 5.1 track on the standard def Director Cut DVD (which I never watched), this is the best I've heard it.  The opening scenes in the desert with the jets came through in ways I had never experienced.This is exploitation all the way - cut major parts of the movie out to add in a bunch of soft-core porn and unnecessary extra violence and still hit the 100 minute mark.  Everything perfect about the theatrical version has been changed, and one cannot always assume that the Director's vision is overall superior to the collective edit.  I'm not saying this is always the case, but I've seen it before (Donnie Darko Director's Cut comes to mind).  I'm not saying the movie is ruined, but ironically, the best way to see it (high def) is not the best way to see it.",2,"Unforgivable (Tony Scott's edit, that is)",1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,2780,"['love', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'conservative', 'estimate', 'thirty', 'times', 'not', 'flawless', 'was', 'always', 'perinneal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'think', 'captures', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'put', 'finger', 'Maybe', 'underlying', 'themes', 'chicken-or-the-egg', 'revenge', 'Tony', 'Todesco', 'soundtrack', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'Mexican', 'vistas', 'pretty', 'strong', 'acting', 'great', 'famous', 'soon-to-be-famous', 'character', 'actors', 'muted', 'hazy', 'cinematography', 'lot', 'love', 'So', 'hunkered', 'down', 'Bluray', 'excited', 'watch', 'one', 'Top', '10', 'movies', 'high-def', 'first', 'time', 'frankly', 'best', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'missed', 'theater', 'lots', 'times', 'VHS', 'many', 'more', '480p', 'DVD', 'Additional', 'excitement', 'perhaps', 'more', 'scenes', 'hand', 'selected', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'would', 'enrich', 'story', 'make', 'favorite', 'even', 'more', 'so.Damn', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'noticed', 'GOOD', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'missing', 'Not', 'extraneous', 'fluff', 'stuff', 'parts', 'movie', 'foreshadowed', 'frankly', 'enriched', 'characters', 'storyline', 'are', 'actually', 'parts', 'now', 'make', 'LESS', 'sense', 'edit', 'before', 'tension', 'Costner', 'Stowe', 'was', 'palatable', 'theatrical', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'initial', 'story', 'gone', 'seemed', 'overly', 'rushed', 'hard', 'understand', 'how', 'things', 'progressed', 'so', 'quickly', 'Tibby', 'Mendez', 'jovial', 'buddy', 'Costner', 'killer', 'almost', 'scene', 'dog/leather', 'jacket', 'removed', 'could', 'go', 'believe', 'did', 'everyone', 'else', 'watching', 'others', 'here', 'have', 'included', 'complete', 'list.I', 'almost', 'turned', 'off', 'popped', 'standard-def', 'theatrical', 'version', 'was', 'bad', 'only', 'reason', 'give', 'generous', 'two', 'stars', 'picture', 'quality', 'amazing', 'clarity', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'didnt', 'rob', 'hazy-Tony-Scott-look', 'only', 'sharpened', 'enhanced', 'sound', 'fantastic', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'track', 'standard', 'def', 'Director', 'Cut', 'DVD', 'never', 'watched', 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'opening', 'scenes', 'desert', 'jets', 'came', 'ways', 'had', 'never', 'experienced.This', 'exploitation', 'way', 'cut', 'major', 'parts', 'movie', 'add', 'bunch', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'unnecessary', 'extra', 'violence', 'still', 'hit', '100', 'minute', 'mark', 'Everything', 'perfect', 'theatrical', 'version', 'been', 'changed', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'assume', 'Director', 'vision', 'overall', 'superior', 'collective', 'edit', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'always', 'case', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Director', 'Cut', 'mind', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'ruined', 'ironically', 'best', 'way', 'see', 'high', 'def', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'see']",N/A
