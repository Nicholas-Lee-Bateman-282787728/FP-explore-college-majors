313207,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302452953,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","A while ago I had the pleasure of seeing 1961's `The Children's Hour', a film that really struck me with its profound look at the anatomy (and destructive course) of the lie.  I had no idea that that film was an adaptation of a film Wyler had made years back called `These Three'.  `These Three' is in fact an adaptation of a stage play entitled (you guessed it) `The Children's Hour'.  Both films are very similar, with one major (yet minor in the same breath) alteration.The film opens with two young women, Martha and Karen, graduating and venturing on a new chapter in their lives.  Karen has inherited an old house and so the two of them decide (with the help of a handsome doctor) to fix it up and turn it into a boarding school for young girls.  When one of their students, the unruly Mary, decides to wreck havoc by spreading a dangerous lie, Martha and Karen find their livelihood ripped out from under them as they are crucified by the community.What struck me so powerfully with the 61 film (staring Audrey Hepburn and a ravishing Shirley MacLaine) was the brute force used in the devastating conclusion, something that is not done here.  Instead, especially because of the plot difference between the two films, the ending is much softer.  It is still devastating in its own right, but there is a sweet `happily ever after' type vibe.  Goes to show you how the times have changed.The 30's were filled with happily ever afters.What I need to point out though, is that this film is still an outstanding film and really delivers on all fronts.  Miriam Hopkins and Merle Oberon are astounding here, especially Hopkins.  I think that character of Martha is the baitier one (MacLaine also had that particular role) and the one that screams for attention (how neither actress garnered Oscar support for their performances is really confusing) but it is how these actresses play the part that really does a number on you.  They have such conviction and such restrained dramatic tension.  It's undeniable how brilliant they are.I found the acting in this film to be more complete than in the 61 film.  For me, `The Children's Hour' is all about MacLaine.  While Hopkins is, by far, best in show here, there are other standouts that deserve recognition.  Aside from the quietly despaired Oberon, there is McCrea, who is dashing, charming and desireable.  There is also Doucet and Kruger who are both frustrating and unlikable in separate ways yet played to such perfection you can't help but completely admire their work.  Marcia Mae Jones is beautifully sincere as the tortured Rosalie, but it is Oscar nominee Bonita Granville that steals all her scenes.Have you ever wanted to strangle a child?  No matter how `wrong' that is, you will want to when you watch Granville's villainous performance.So, in the end I strongly recommend BOTH films because they are so amazing.  I may slightly prefer the '61 remake because of the controversial taboo nature of the script (and that ending will NEVER leave me) but this one is just as stellar, really.",5,The hour of the lie...,1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,3047,"['while', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', '1961', 'Children', 'Hour', 'film', 'really', 'struck', 'profound', 'look', 'anatomy', 'destructive', 'course', 'lie', 'had', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'adaptation', 'film', 'Wyler', 'had', 'made', 'years', 'back', 'called', 'Three', 'Three', 'fact', 'adaptation', 'stage', 'play', 'entitled', 'guessed', 'Children', 'Hour', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'major', 'yet', 'minor', 'same', 'breath', 'alteration.The', 'film', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'Martha', 'Karen', 'graduating', 'venturing', 'new', 'chapter', 'lives', 'Karen', 'inherited', 'old', 'house', 'so', 'two', 'decide', 'help', 'handsome', 'doctor', 'fix', 'up', 'turn', 'boarding', 'school', 'young', 'girls', 'When', 'one', 'students', 'unruly', 'Mary', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'spreading', 'dangerous', 'lie', 'Martha', 'Karen', 'find', 'livelihood', 'ripped', 'are', 'crucified', 'community.What', 'struck', 'powerfully', '61', 'film', 'staring', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'ravishing', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'was', 'brute', 'force', 'used', 'devastating', 'conclusion', 'something', 'not', 'done', 'here', 'Instead', 'especially', 'plot', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'ending', 'much', 'softer', 'still', 'devastating', 'own', 'right', 'sweet', 'happily', 'ever', 'type', 'vibe', 'show', 'how', 'times', 'have', 'changed.The', '30', 'were', 'filled', 'happily', 'ever', 'need', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'still', 'outstanding', 'film', 'really', 'delivers', 'fronts', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'are', 'astounding', 'here', 'especially', 'Hopkins', 'think', 'character', 'Martha', 'baitier', 'one', 'MacLaine', 'also', 'had', 'particular', 'role', 'one', 'attention', 'how', 'actress', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'support', 'performances', 'really', 'confusing', 'how', 'actresses', 'play', 'part', 'really', 'number', 'have', 'such', 'conviction', 'such', 'restrained', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'undeniable', 'how', 'brilliant', 'are.I', 'found', 'acting', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'complete', '61', 'film', 'Children', 'Hour', 'MacLaine', 'Hopkins', 'far', 'best', 'show', 'here', 'are', 'other', 'standouts', 'deserve', 'recognition', 'Aside', 'quietly', 'despaired', 'Oberon', 'McCrea', 'who', 'dashing', 'charming', 'desireable', 'also', 'Doucet', 'Kruger', 'who', 'are', 'frustrating', 'unlikable', 'separate', 'ways', 'yet', 'played', 'such', 'perfection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'completely', 'admire', 'work', 'Marcia', 'Mae', 'Jones', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'tortured', 'Rosalie', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'scenes.Have', 'ever', 'wanted', 'strangle', 'child', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'wrong', 'will', 'want', 'when', 'watch', 'Granville', 'villainous', 'performance.So', 'end', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'amazing', 'may', 'slightly', 'prefer', ""'61"", 'remake', 'controversial', 'taboo', 'nature', 'script', 'ending', 'will', 'NEVER', 'leave', 'one', 'just', 'stellar', 'really']",These Three VHS

Merle Oberon and Miriam Hopkins are best friends and teachers at a school, and young Bonita Granville concludes that Hopkins has become involved with Oberon's boyfriend Joel McCrea.  Granville has gotten herself into trouble, so she spreads the rumour to deflect her concerned grandmother's attention.  Hopkins, Oberon, and McCrea are all fine, but it is Granville who takes the acting honours.  She is vicious, mean, and completely believable and dislikeable as the young girl who needs a firm hand.  Marcia Mae Jones as her weak accomplice, easily manipulated, is also convincing.  The movie illustrates well how a lie can grow and damage the lives of those involved.

313211,AD2BIAIH78QI5,6302452953,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[11, 11]","That's the crux of the matter in ""These Three"", a story of three innocent adults whose reputations are ruined by a vindictive girl. Merle Oberon and Miriam Hopkins open a girls' school on  Merle's grandma's old farm, which they handily renovate with the help of nearby neighbor, doctor Joel McCrea. Though they at first start out three comrades, it doesn't take long before Joel and Merle pair off, leaving Miriam to carry a torch--silently--for the handsome doctor. Everything remains aboveboard, though, as Miriam is a true friend to Merle.A wealthy society matron decides to patronize the new school by sending her wayward granddaughter to be a pupil there; around the same time, Miriam's selfish old aunt swoops down to be an elocution teacher. Another little girl is at the school, too; a nicer girl, but one who has the misfortune to be caught by the bad girl stealing a bracelet. This is the bad chemistry set. When Miriam tries to give the useless aunt the brush off and send her to Europe, the angered older woman makes loud nasty insinuations that are overheard by the malcontent child, who then invents a wild story suggesting impropriety, and blackmails the thieving nice girl into corroborating the story, which is totally believed by the grandmother, who broadcasts it far and wide, causing the school to fold. The three innocents are forced to fight to clear their names against the word of a respected grand dame and two supposedly ""innocent"" children. Plenty of drama unfolds.I was unimpressed when I first saw this years ago, but now having seen it again playing double feature at a revival hourse with another favorite movie of mine, I must alter my opinion. ""These Three"" is really quite a GOOD movie, with solid performances by all concerned. Merle and Miriam have each their strong points and Joel McCrea is a handsome hunk that anyone's best friend would pine for, too. The old grandmother brings an interesting dimension to the role, as she projects a woman truly believing herself to act for the good of children under the care of immoral persons. She's very effective. The real standouts, though, are the two little girls. Marcia Mae Jones is the little thief. This is the same girl who later appeared in the Shirley Temple movies, ""Heidi"" and ""The Little Princess"". The only other time I've seen her was in ""Night Nurse"", a pre-Code flick about Clark Gable's intention to murder the children of a hophead to gain control of her fortune (yeah, that's really the trashy plot of THAT one). She is the perfect foil to the evil girl, Bonita Granville. What an actress that kid is! I don't recall ever having seen her before or since, but that's everyone's loss. She brings more to her role than any of the adult stars--the venom she can display is truly frightening.After you take in ""These Three"", I bet you'll wonder yourself about some of the little girls you know, as to whether they could ever be capable of the malicious lies spread in this movie--and who knows?

313212,A1BVCH82W0M2W2,6302452953,"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more...","[2, 2]","In 1934 noted American playwright Lillian Hellman introduced her play  ""The Children's Hour"" to audiences around the world.  Over the next couple of years the play would become a substantial hit.  The central theme of ""The Children's Hour"" is what happens when two young headmistresses are accused of having a lesbian affair by a disgruntled young student.  Of course the charges are not true but that will not stop the powers that be in town to destroy everything the two young women have worked so very hard to create.  In 1936, producer Samuel Goldwyn and director William Wyler would bring this powerful play to the silver screen.  SInce something called The Production Code (a set of motion picture industry censorship guidelines)  forbade the subject of lesbianism to be broached in films, Goldwyn and Wyler decided to change the name of the film to ""These Three"" and substituted the charges of lesbianism between the two teachers to a heterosexual love triangle involving the two young teachers and a doctor in town who is the fiancee of one of them.  As it turns out these changes did not detract from ""These Three"" one little bit.""These Three"" (a rather odd name for a film, don't you think?) stars Merle Oberlon and Miriam Hopkins as recently graduated young teachers who come to town with visions of creating a school in a run down old house that one of them has inherited from her grandmother.  Shortly after they arrive in town the girls meet up with a local doctor named Joe Cardin (Joel McCrea) who embraces the idea of the school and vows to help them make it become a reality.  In the course of renovating the property Dr. Joe and Karen Wright (Oberlon) fall head over heels for each other.  Meanwhile,  Martha Dobie (Hopkins) also has feelings for the dashing young medic but vows to keep her feelings to herself rather than compete for his affections with her best friend.  Funding for the school was obtained by the generous donation of the town's most prominent citizen Mrs. Amelia Tilford (Alma Kruger) who promises to send her young granddaughter to the school.  Bonita Granville plays young Mary Tilford who is evil incarnate.  Most critics agree that it is Granville who steals the show in this film.  Mary is not at all happy in this school.  She is in an incorrigible brat who as Dr. Cardin observes at one point in the movie could use a good dose of the hairbrush.  It is Mary who conjures up and spreads the story about the alleged  love triangle going on within the confines of the school.  As one might expect the results are devastating for just about everyone involved in this unhappy incident.Throughout the  course of ""These Three"" my wife and I kept turning to each other and remarking just how fabulous this film is.  The acting is first rate by virtually every single person in this movie including several of the children.  A special hats off to Marcia Mae Jones who plays the part of schoolgirl Rosalie Wells.  You will also find a very young Walter Brennan as well as Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West in 'The Wizard of Oz"") with bit roles in this film. My wife and I continue to be amazed at the quality of the films that were made in the 1930's and 1940's.  ""These Three"" is just another example of what happens when great writing and fine acting come together.  As I mentioned in the headline above, ""These Three"" certainly rivals anything that the great Alfred Hitchcock  ever made.

313213,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6302452953,Randy Keehn,"[4, 4]","I just saw this movie for the first time and I was greatly impressed. I guess what impressed me the most was how the writer and director could cover such a topic so well back in 1936.  I was informed that the play, by Lillian Hellman, had an even more notorious subject matter but this movie got the point across.  The story, in brief, is that of two college graduate women who decide to open a girl's school in a small New England community.  Early on in the movie we meet a doctor (Joel McCrea) who falls in love with one of the women.  The other woman secretly loves him too but reveals this to no one.  There comes a point when a set of circumstances and gossip enable one of the students to make false accusations about the three adults.  A scandal breaks out and I'll leave it at that.  The point of the movie, at least for me, was how lies, gossip and inuendos can destroy perfectly (or almost perfectly) innocent people.  The point is well made in ""These Three"".The acting is good and we can appreciate many subtleties in how the actors look and interact with one another.  However, the best performances come from the devilish kids who create the scandal.  I noticed two familiar actors whose names were not on the opening credits; Walter Brennan and Margaret Hamilton, both of who became far more famous that the stars.The Hellman play, as I understand it, dealt with a lesbian relationship between the two women which was obviously too much for Hollywood in 1936.  I understand it was this relationship that WAS used in the later movie ""The Children's Hour"" which was also based on the Hellman play.  I haven't seen that movie but it certainly explains why I never saw it when I was growing up.  (I heard of it and wondered, from the title, why I hadn't had the opportunity to see what I thought was a children's movie).  Still, the suggestion of an immoral relationship involving one man and two women was risque enough.  Having juvenile girls discussing these things was even more so.  I noticed when ""THE END"" came on the screen there was a notation below that said ""Approved by the National Film Board"" or words to that effect.  Maybe I never noticed that phrase in older movies before.  I certainly noticed it on this one, though.",4,Amazing film for 1936,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,2246,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'greatly', 'impressed', 'guess', 'what', 'impressed', 'most', 'was', 'how', 'writer', 'director', 'could', 'cover', 'topic', 'so', 'well', 'back', '1936', 'was', 'informed', 'play', 'Lillian', 'Hellman', 'had', 'even', 'more', 'notorious', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'got', 'point', 'story', 'brief', 'two', 'college', 'graduate', 'women', 'who', 'decide', 'open', 'girl', 'school', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'community', 'Early', 'movie', 'meet', 'doctor', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'who', 'love', 'one', 'women', 'other', 'woman', 'secretly', 'too', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'set', 'circumstances', 'gossip', 'enable', 'one', 'students', 'make', 'false', 'accusations', 'three', 'adults', 'scandal', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'point', 'movie', 'least', 'was', 'how', 'lies', 'gossip', 'inuendos', 'can', 'destroy', 'perfectly', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'innocent', 'people', 'point', 'well', 'made', 'Three', '.The', 'acting', 'good', 'can', 'appreciate', 'many', 'subtleties', 'how', 'actors', 'look', 'interact', 'one', 'However', 'best', 'performances', 'come', 'devilish', 'kids', 'who', 'create', 'scandal', 'noticed', 'two', 'familiar', 'actors', 'names', 'were', 'not', 'opening', 'credits', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'became', 'far', 'more', 'famous', 'stars.The', 'Hellman', 'play', 'understand', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'two', 'women', 'was', 'obviously', 'too', 'much', 'Hollywood', '1936', 'understand', 'was', 'relationship', 'WAS', 'used', 'later', 'movie', 'Children', 'Hour', 'was', 'also', 'based', 'Hellman', 'play', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'certainly', 'why', 'never', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'heard', 'wondered', 'title', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'children', 'movie', 'Still', 'suggestion', 'immoral', 'relationship', 'involving', 'one', 'man', 'two', 'women', 'was', 'risque', 'enough', 'Having', 'juvenile', 'girls', 'discussing', 'things', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'noticed', 'when', 'END', 'came', 'screen', 'was', 'notation', 'said', 'Approved', 'National', 'Film', 'Board', 'words', 'effect', 'Maybe', 'never', 'noticed', 'phrase', 'older', 'movies', 'certainly', 'noticed', 'one', 'though']",These Three VHS

Miriam Hopkins has the most varied role of Martha which she performs with colour and vigour. Merle Oberon is surprisingly effective in the final scenes when her suspicions come to surface. Bonita Granville, in a performance which shocked many in 1936 is vicious as the selfish Mary; the sad eyed Marcia Mae Jones is great as the easily frightened Rosalie. The plot simply stems from Mary telling her grandmother (Alma Kruger) that she knows of 'ugly' things that go on in the school which is painstakenly run by Hopkins and Oberon. Does their mutual friend Joel McCrea do more than visit on occasion?........Margaret Hamilton has a great scene where she (a housekeeper,natch) smacks little devil Mary but good.(It is recorded that in 1936 audiences literally cheered in the theatre).
